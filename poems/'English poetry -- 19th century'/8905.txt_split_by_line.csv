65,PREFACE.,
66,PREFACE.,The First Volume of these Poems has already been submitted to
67,PREFACE.,"general perusal. It was published, as an experiment which, I hoped,"
68,PREFACE.,"might be of some use to ascertain, how far, by fitting to metrical"
69,PREFACE.,arrangement a selection of the real language of men in a state of
70,PREFACE.,"vivid sensation, that sort of pleasure and that quantity of pleasure"
71,PREFACE.,"may be imparted, which a Poet may rationally endeavour to impart."
72,PREFACE.,
73,PREFACE.,I had formed no very inaccurate estimate of the probable effect of
74,PREFACE.,those Poems: I flattered myself that they who should be pleased with
75,PREFACE.,them would read them with more than common pleasure: and on the
76,PREFACE.,other hand I was well aware that by those who should dislike them
77,PREFACE.,they would be read with more than common dislike. The result has
78,PREFACE.,"differed from my expectation in this only, that I have pleased a"
79,PREFACE.,"greater number, than I ventured to hope I should please."
80,PREFACE.,
81,PREFACE.,For the sake of variety and from a consciousness of my own weakness
82,PREFACE.,"I was induced to request the assistance of a Friend, who furnished me"
83,PREFACE.,"with the Poems of the ANCIENT MARINER, the FOSTER-MOTHER'S TALE, the"
84,PREFACE.,"NIGHTINGALE, the DUNGEON, and the Poem entitled LOVE. I should not,"
85,PREFACE.,"however, have requested this assistance, had I not believed that the"
86,PREFACE.,poems of my Friend would in a great measure have the same tendency
87,PREFACE.,"as my own, and that, though there would be found a difference, there"
88,PREFACE.,would be found no discordance in the colours of our style; as our
89,PREFACE.,opinions on the subject of poetry do almost entirely coincide.
90,PREFACE.,
91,PREFACE.,Several of my Friends are anxious for the success of these Poems
92,PREFACE.,"from a belief, that if the views, with which they were composed,"
93,PREFACE.,"were indeed realized, a class of Poetry would be produced, well"
94,PREFACE.,"adapted to interest mankind permanently, and not unimportant in the"
95,PREFACE.,multiplicity and in the quality of its moral relations: and on this
96,PREFACE.,account they have advised me to prefix a systematic defence of the
97,PREFACE.,"theory, upon which the poems were written. But I was unwilling to"
98,PREFACE.,"undertake the task, because I knew that on this occasion the Reader"
99,PREFACE.,"would look coldly upon my arguments, since I might be suspected of"
100,PREFACE.,having been principally influenced by the selfish and foolish hope
101,PREFACE.,of _reasoning_ him into an approbation of these particular Poems:
102,PREFACE.,"and I was still more unwilling to undertake the task, because"
103,PREFACE.,adequately to display my opinions and fully to enforce my arguments
104,PREFACE.,would require a space wholly disproportionate to the nature of a
105,PREFACE.,"preface. For to treat the subject with the clearness and coherence,"
106,PREFACE.,"of which I believe it susceptible, it would be necessary to give a"
107,PREFACE.,"full account of the present state of the public taste in this country,"
108,PREFACE.,and to determine how far this taste is healthy or depraved; which
109,PREFACE.,"again could not be determined, without pointing out, in what manner"
110,PREFACE.,"language and the human mind act and react on each other, and without"
111,PREFACE.,retracing the revolutions not of literature alone but likewise of
112,PREFACE.,society itself. I have therefore altogether declined to enter
113,PREFACE.,"regularly upon this defence; yet I am sensible, that there would be"
114,PREFACE.,"some impropriety in abruptly obtruding upon the Public, without a"
115,PREFACE.,"few words of introduction, Poems so materially different from those,"
116,PREFACE.,upon which general approbation is at present bestowed.
117,PREFACE.,
118,PREFACE.,"It is supposed, that by the act of writing in verse an Author makes"
119,PREFACE.,a formal engagement that he will gratify certain known habits of
120,PREFACE.,"association, that he not only thus apprizes the Reader that certain"
121,PREFACE.,"classes of ideas and expressions will be found in his book, but that"
122,PREFACE.,others will be carefully excluded. This exponent or symbol held
123,PREFACE.,forth by metrical language must in different aeras of literature
124,PREFACE.,"have excited very different expectations: for example, in the age of"
125,PREFACE.,"Catullus Terence and Lucretius, and that of Statius or Claudian, and"
126,PREFACE.,"in our own country, in the age of Shakespeare and Beaumont and"
127,PREFACE.,"Fletcher, and that of Donne and Cowley, or Dryden, or Pope. I will"
128,PREFACE.,not take upon me to determine the exact import of the promise which
129,PREFACE.,by the act of writing in verse an Author in the present day makes to
130,PREFACE.,his Reader; but I am certain it will appear to many persons that I
131,PREFACE.,have not fulfilled the terms of an engagement thus voluntarily
132,PREFACE.,"contracted. I hope therefore the Reader will not censure me, if I"
133,PREFACE.,"attempt to state what I have proposed to myself to perform, and also,"
134,PREFACE.,(as far as the limits of a preface will permit) to explain some of
135,PREFACE.,the chief reasons which have determined me in the choice of my
136,PREFACE.,purpose: that at least he may be spared any unpleasant feeling of
137,PREFACE.,"disappointment, and that I myself may be protected from the most"
138,PREFACE.,"dishonorable accusation which can be brought against an Author,"
139,PREFACE.,"namely, that of an indolence which prevents him from endeavouring to"
140,PREFACE.,"ascertain what is his duty, or, when his duty is ascertained"
141,PREFACE.,prevents him from performing it.
142,PREFACE.,
143,PREFACE.,The principal object then which I proposed to myself in these Poems
144,PREFACE.,was to make the incidents of common life interesting by tracing in
145,PREFACE.,"them, truly though not ostentatiously, the primary laws of our nature:"
146,PREFACE.,chiefly as far as regards the manner in which we associate ideas in
147,PREFACE.,a state of excitement. Low and rustic life was generally chosen
148,PREFACE.,because in that situation the essential passions of the heart find a
149,PREFACE.,"better soil in which they can attain their maturity, are less under"
150,PREFACE.,"restraint, and speak a plainer and more emphatic language; because"
151,PREFACE.,in that situation our elementary feelings exist in a state of
152,PREFACE.,greater simplicity and consequently may be more accurately
153,PREFACE.,contemplated and more forcibly communicated; because the manners of
154,PREFACE.,rural life germinate from those elementary feelings; and from the
155,PREFACE.,necessary character of rural occupations are more easily comprehended;
156,PREFACE.,"and are more durable; and lastly, because in that situation the"
157,PREFACE.,passions of men are incorporated with the beautiful and permanent
158,PREFACE.,forms of nature. The language too of these men is adopted (purified
159,PREFACE.,"indeed from what appear to be its real defects, from all lasting and"
160,PREFACE.,rational causes of dislike or disgust) because such men hourly
161,PREFACE.,communicate with the best objects from which the best part of
162,PREFACE.,"language is originally derived; and because, from their rank in"
163,PREFACE.,"society and the sameness and narrow circle of their intercourse,"
164,PREFACE.,being less under the action of social vanity they convey their
165,PREFACE.,feelings and notions in simple and unelaborated expressions.
166,PREFACE.,Accordingly such a language arising out of repeated experience and
167,PREFACE.,regular feelings is a more permanent and a far more philosophical
168,PREFACE.,"language than that which is frequently substituted for it by Poets,"
169,PREFACE.,who think that they are conferring honour upon themselves and their
170,PREFACE.,art in proportion as they separate themselves from the sympathies of
171,PREFACE.,"men, and indulge in arbitrary and capricious habits of expression in"
172,PREFACE.,order to furnish food for fickle tastes and fickle appetites of
173,PREFACE.,their own creation.[1]
174,PREFACE.,
175,PREFACE.,[Footnote 1: It is worth while here to observe that the affecting
176,PREFACE.,parts of Chaucer are almost always expressed in language pure and
177,PREFACE.,universally intelligible even to this day.]
178,PREFACE.,
179,PREFACE.,I cannot be insensible of the present outcry against the triviality
180,PREFACE.,"and meanness both of thought and language, which some of my"
181,PREFACE.,contemporaries have occasionally introduced into their metrical
182,PREFACE.,"compositions; and I acknowledge that this defect where it exists, is"
183,PREFACE.,more dishonorable to the Writer's own character than false
184,PREFACE.,"refinement or arbitrary innovation, though I should contend at the"
185,PREFACE.,same time that it is far less pernicious in the sum of its
186,PREFACE.,consequences. From such verses the Poems in these volumes will be
187,PREFACE.,"found distinguished at least by one mark of difference, that each of"
188,PREFACE.,"them has a worthy _purpose_. Not that I mean to say, that I always"
189,PREFACE.,began to write with a distinct purpose formally conceived; but I
190,PREFACE.,"believe that my habits of meditation have so formed my feelings, as"
191,PREFACE.,that my descriptions of such objects as strongly excite those
192,PREFACE.,"feelings, will be found to carry along with them a _purpose_. If in"
193,PREFACE.,this opinion I am mistaken I can have little right to the name of a
194,PREFACE.,Poet. For all good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful
195,PREFACE.,"feelings; but though this be true, Poems to which any value can be"
196,PREFACE.,"attached, were never produced on any variety of subjects but by a"
197,PREFACE.,man who being possessed of more than usual organic sensibility had
198,PREFACE.,also thought long and deeply. For our continued influxes of feeling
199,PREFACE.,"are modified and directed by our thoughts, which are indeed the"
200,PREFACE.,representatives of all our past feelings; and as by contemplating
201,PREFACE.,"the relation of these general representatives to each other, we"
202,PREFACE.,"discover what is really important to men, so by the repetition and"
203,PREFACE.,continuance of this act feelings connected with important subjects
204,PREFACE.,"will be nourished, till at length, if we be originally possessed of"
205,PREFACE.,"much organic sensibility, such habits of mind will be produced that"
206,PREFACE.,by obeying blindly and mechanically the impulses of those habits we
207,PREFACE.,shall describe objects and utter sentiments of such a nature and in
208,PREFACE.,"such connection with each other, that the understanding of the being"
209,PREFACE.,"to whom we address ourselves, if he be in a healthful state of"
210,PREFACE.,"association, must necessarily be in some degree enlightened, his"
211,PREFACE.,"taste exalted, and his affections ameliorated."
212,PREFACE.,
213,PREFACE.,I have said that each of these poems has a purpose. I have also
214,PREFACE.,informed my Reader what this purpose will be found principally to be:
215,PREFACE.,namely to illustrate the manner in which our feelings and ideas are
216,PREFACE.,associated in a state of excitement. But speaking in less general
217,PREFACE.,"language, it is to follow the fluxes and refluxes of the mind when"
218,PREFACE.,agitated by the great and simple affections of our nature. This
219,PREFACE.,object I have endeavoured in these short essays to attain by various
220,PREFACE.,means; by tracing the maternal passion through many of its more
221,PREFACE.,"subtle windings, as in the poems of the IDIOT BOY and the MAD MOTHER;"
222,PREFACE.,by accompanying the last struggles of a human being at the approach
223,PREFACE.,"of death, cleaving in solitude to life and society, as in the Poem"
224,PREFACE.,"of the FORSAKEN INDIAN; by shewing, as in the Stanzas entitled WE"
225,PREFACE.,"ARE SEVEN, the perplexity and obscurity which in childhood attend"
226,PREFACE.,"our notion of death, or rather our utter inability to admit that"
227,PREFACE.,"notion; or by displaying the strength of fraternal, or to speak more"
228,PREFACE.,"philosophically, of moral attachment when early associated with the"
229,PREFACE.,"great and beautiful objects of nature, as in THE BROTHERS; or, as in"
230,PREFACE.,"the Incident of SIMON LEE, by placing my Reader in the way of"
231,PREFACE.,receiving from ordinary moral sensations another and more salutary
232,PREFACE.,impression than we are accustomed to receive from them. It has also
233,PREFACE.,been part of my general purpose to attempt to sketch characters
234,PREFACE.,"under the influence of less impassioned feelings, as in the OLD MAN"
235,PREFACE.,"TRAVELLING, THE TWO THIEVES, &c. characters of which the elements"
236,PREFACE.,"are simple, belonging rather to nature than to manners, such as"
237,PREFACE.,"exist now and will probably always exist, and which from their"
238,PREFACE.,constitution may be distinctly and profitably contemplated. I will
239,PREFACE.,not abuse the indulgence of my Reader by dwelling longer upon this
240,PREFACE.,subject; but it is proper that I should mention one other
241,PREFACE.,circumstance which distinguishes these Poems from the popular Poetry
242,PREFACE.,"of the day; it is this, that the feeling therein developed gives"
243,PREFACE.,importance to the action and situation and not the action and
244,PREFACE.,situation to the feeling. My meaning will be rendered perfectly
245,PREFACE.,intelligible by referring my Reader to the Poems entitled POOR SUSAN
246,PREFACE.,"and the CHILDLESS FATHER, particularly to the last Stanza of the"
247,PREFACE.,latter Poem.
248,PREFACE.,
249,PREFACE.,I will not suffer a sense of false modesty to prevent me from
250,PREFACE.,"asserting, that I point my Reader's attention to this mark of"
251,PREFACE.,distinction far less for the sake of these particular Poems than
252,PREFACE.,from the general importance of the subject. The subject is indeed
253,PREFACE.,important! For the human mind is capable of excitement without the
254,PREFACE.,application of gross and violent stimulants; and he must have a very
255,PREFACE.,"faint perception of its beauty and dignity who does not know this,"
256,PREFACE.,and who does not further know that one being is elevated above
257,PREFACE.,another in proportion as he possesses this capability. It has
258,PREFACE.,therefore appeared to me that to endeavour to produce or enlarge
259,PREFACE.,"this capability is one of the best services in which, at any period,"
260,PREFACE.,"a Writer can be engaged; but this service, excellent at all times,"
261,PREFACE.,is especially so at the present day. For a multitude of causes
262,PREFACE.,unknown to former times are now acting with a combined force to
263,PREFACE.,"blunt the discriminating powers of the mind, and unfitting it for"
264,PREFACE.,all voluntary exertion to reduce it to a state of almost savage
265,PREFACE.,torpor. The most effective of these causes are the great national
266,PREFACE.,"events which are daily taking place, and the encreasing accumulation"
267,PREFACE.,"of men in cities, where the uniformity of their occupations produces"
268,PREFACE.,a craving for extraordinary incident which the rapid communication
269,PREFACE.,of intelligence hourly gratifies. To this tendency of life and
270,PREFACE.,manners the literature and theatrical exhibitions of the country have
271,PREFACE.,"conformed themselves. The invaluable works of our elder writers, I"
272,PREFACE.,"had almost said the works of Shakespeare and Milton, are driven into"
273,PREFACE.,"neglect by frantic novels, sickly and stupid German Tragedies, and"
274,PREFACE.,deluges of idle and extravagant stories in verse.--When I think upon
275,PREFACE.,this degrading thirst after outrageous stimulation I am almost
276,PREFACE.,ashamed to have spoken of the feeble effort with which I have
277,PREFACE.,endeavoured to counteract it; and reflecting upon the magnitude of
278,PREFACE.,"the general evil, I should be oppressed with no dishonorable"
279,PREFACE.,"melancholy, had I not a deep impression of certain inherent and"
280,PREFACE.,"indestructible qualities of the human mind, and likewise of certain"
281,PREFACE.,powers in the great and permanent objects that act upon it which are
282,PREFACE.,equally inherent and indestructible; and did I not further add to
283,PREFACE.,this impression a belief that the time is approaching when the evil
284,PREFACE.,will be systematically opposed by men of greater powers and with far
285,PREFACE.,more distinguished success.
286,PREFACE.,
287,PREFACE.,"Having dwelt thus long on the subjects and aim of these Poems, I"
288,PREFACE.,shall request the Reader's permission to apprize him of a few
289,PREFACE.,"circumstances relating to their _style_, in order, among other"
290,PREFACE.,"reasons, that I may not be censured for not having performed what I"
291,PREFACE.,never attempted. Except in a very few instances the Reader will find
292,PREFACE.,"no personifications of abstract ideas in these volumes, not that I"
293,PREFACE.,mean to censure such personifications: they may be well fitted for
294,PREFACE.,"certain sorts of composition, but in these Poems I propose to myself"
295,PREFACE.,"to imitate, and, as far as possible, to adopt the very language of"
296,PREFACE.,"men, and I do not find that such personifications make any regular"
297,PREFACE.,or natural part of that language. I wish to keep my Reader in the
298,PREFACE.,"company of flesh and blood, persuaded that by so doing I shall"
299,PREFACE.,interest him. Not but that I believe that others who pursue a
300,PREFACE.,different track may interest him likewise: I do not interfere with
301,PREFACE.,"their claim, I only wish to prefer a different claim of my own."
302,PREFACE.,There will also be found in these volumes little of what is usually
303,PREFACE.,called poetic diction; I have taken as much pains to avoid it as
304,PREFACE.,others ordinarily take to produce it; this I have done for the
305,PREFACE.,"reason already alleged, to bring my language near to the language of"
306,PREFACE.,"men, and further, because the pleasure which I have proposed to"
307,PREFACE.,myself to impart is of a kind very different from that which is
308,PREFACE.,supposed by many persons to be the proper object of poetry. I do not
309,PREFACE.,know how without being culpably particular I can give my Reader a
310,PREFACE.,more exact notion of the style in which I wished these poems to be
311,PREFACE.,written than by informing him that I have at all times endeavoured
312,PREFACE.,"to look steadily at my subject, consequently I hope it will be found"
313,PREFACE.,"that there is in these Poems little falsehood of description, and"
314,PREFACE.,that my ideas are expressed in language fitted to their respective
315,PREFACE.,"importance. Something I must have gained by this practice, as it is"
316,PREFACE.,"friendly to one property of all good poetry, namely good sense; but"
317,PREFACE.,it has necessarily cut me off from a large portion of phrases and
318,PREFACE.,figures of speech which from father to son have long been regarded
319,PREFACE.,as the common inheritance of Poets. I have also thought it expedient
320,PREFACE.,"to restrict myself still further, having abstained from the use of"
321,PREFACE.,"many expressions, in themselves proper and beautiful, but which have"
322,PREFACE.,been foolishly repeated by bad Poets till such feelings of disgust
323,PREFACE.,are connected with them as it is scarcely possible by any art of
324,PREFACE.,association to overpower.
325,PREFACE.,
326,PREFACE.,"If in a Poem there should be found a series of lines, or even a"
327,PREFACE.,"single line, in which the language, though naturally arranged and"
328,PREFACE.,"according to the strict laws of metre, does not differ from that of"
329,PREFACE.,"prose, there is a numerous class of critics who, when they stumble"
330,PREFACE.,"upon these prosaisms as they call them, imagine that they have made"
331,PREFACE.,"a notable discovery, and exult over the Poet as over a man ignorant"
332,PREFACE.,of his own profession. Now these men would establish a canon of
333,PREFACE.,criticism which the Reader will conclude he must utterly reject if he
334,PREFACE.,wishes to be pleased with these volumes. And it would be a most easy
335,PREFACE.,task to prove to him that not only the language of a large portion
336,PREFACE.,"of every good poem, even of the most elevated character, must"
337,PREFACE.,"necessarily, except with reference to the metre, in no respect"
338,PREFACE.,"differ from that of good prose, but likewise that some of the most"
339,PREFACE.,interesting parts of the best poems will be found to be strictly the
340,PREFACE.,language of prose when prose is well written. The truth of this
341,PREFACE.,assertion might be demonstrated by innumerable passages from almost
342,PREFACE.,"all the poetical writings, even of Milton himself. I have not space"
343,PREFACE.,"for much quotation; but, to illustrate the subject in a general"
344,PREFACE.,"manner, I will here adduce a short composition of Gray, who was at"
345,PREFACE.,the head of those who by their reasonings have attempted to widen
346,PREFACE.,"the space of separation betwixt Prose and Metrical composition, and"
347,PREFACE.,was more than any other man curiously elaborate in the structure of
348,PREFACE.,his own poetic diction.
349,PREFACE.,
350,PREFACE.,
351,PREFACE.,"In vain to me the smiling mornings shine,"
352,PREFACE.,And reddening Phoebus lifts his golden fire:
353,PREFACE.,"The birds in vain their amorous descant join,"
354,PREFACE.,Or chearful fields resume their green attire:
355,PREFACE.,These ears alas! for other notes repine;
356,PREFACE.,_A different object do these eyes require;
357,PREFACE.,My lonely anguish melts no heart but mine;
358,PREFACE.,And in my breast the imperfect joys expire;_
359,PREFACE.,"Yet Morning smiles the busy race to cheer,"
360,PREFACE.,And new-born pleasure brings to happier men;
361,PREFACE.,The fields to all their wonted tribute bear;
362,PREFACE.,To warm their little loves the birds complain.
363,PREFACE.,_I fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear
364,PREFACE.,And weep the more because I weep in vain._
365,PREFACE.,
366,PREFACE.,
367,PREFACE.,It will easily be perceived that the only part of this Sonnet which
368,PREFACE.,is of any value is the lines printed in Italics: it is equally
369,PREFACE.,"obvious that except in the rhyme, and in the use of the single word"
370,PREFACE.,"""fruitless"" for fruitlessly, which is so far a defect, the language"
371,PREFACE.,of these lines does in no respect differ from that of prose.
372,PREFACE.,
373,PREFACE.,"Is there then, it will be asked, no essential difference between the"
374,PREFACE.,language of prose and metrical composition? I answer that there
375,PREFACE.,neither is nor can be any essential difference. We are fond of
376,PREFACE.,"tracing the resemblance between Poetry and Painting, and, accordingly,"
377,PREFACE.,we call them Sisters: but where shall we find bonds of connection
378,PREFACE.,sufficiently strict to typify the affinity betwixt metrical and
379,PREFACE.,prose composition? They both speak by and to the same organs; the
380,PREFACE.,bodies in which both of them are clothed may be said to be of the
381,PREFACE.,"same substance, their affections are kindred and almost identical,"
382,PREFACE.,not necessarily differing even in degree; Poetry [2] sheds no tears
383,PREFACE.,"""such as Angels weep,"" but natural and human tears; she can boast of"
384,PREFACE.,no celestial Ichor that distinguishes her vital juices from those of
385,PREFACE.,prose; the same human blood circulates through the veins of them both.
386,PREFACE.,
387,PREFACE.,"[Footnote 2: I here use the word ""Poetry"" (though against my own"
388,PREFACE.,"judgment) as opposed to the word Prose, and synonomous with metrical"
389,PREFACE.,composition. But much confusion has been introduced into criticism
390,PREFACE.,"by this contradistinction of Poetry and Prose, instead of the more"
391,PREFACE.,philosophical one of Poetry and Science. The only strict antithesis
392,PREFACE.,to Prose is Metre.]
393,PREFACE.,
394,PREFACE.,
395,PREFACE.,If it be affirmed that rhyme and metrical arrangement of themselves
396,PREFACE.,constitute a distinction which overturns what I have been saying on
397,PREFACE.,"the strict affinity of metrical language with that of prose, and"
398,PREFACE.,paves the way for other distinctions which the mind voluntarily
399,PREFACE.,"admits, I answer that the distinction of rhyme and metre is regular"
400,PREFACE.,"and uniform, and not, like that which is produced by what is usually"
401,PREFACE.,"called poetic diction, arbitrary and subject to infinite caprices"
402,PREFACE.,upon which no calculation whatever can be made. In the one case
403,PREFACE.,the Reader is utterly at the mercy of the Poet respecting what
404,PREFACE.,"imagery or diction he may choose to connect with the passion,"
405,PREFACE.,"whereas in the other the metre obeys certain laws, to which the"
406,PREFACE.,"Poet and Reader both willingly submit because they are certain,"
407,PREFACE.,and because no interference is made by them with the passion but
408,PREFACE.,such as the concurring testimony of ages has shewn to heighten
409,PREFACE.,and improve the pleasure which co-exists with it. It will now
410,PREFACE.,"be proper to answer an obvious question, namely, why, professing"
411,PREFACE.,these opinions have I written in verse? To this in the first place
412,PREFACE.,"I reply, because, however I may have restricted myself, there is"
413,PREFACE.,still left open to me what confessedly constitutes the most valuable
414,PREFACE.,"object of all writing whether in prose or verse, the great and"
415,PREFACE.,"universal passions of men, the most general and interesting of"
416,PREFACE.,"their occupations, and the entire world of nature, from which I am"
417,PREFACE.,at liberty to supply myself with endless combinations of forms and
418,PREFACE.,"imagery. Now, granting for a moment that whatever is interesting in"
419,PREFACE.,"these objects may be as vividly described in prose, why am I to be"
420,PREFACE.,condemned if to such description I have endeavoured to superadd the
421,PREFACE.,charm which by the consent of all nations is acknowledged to exist
422,PREFACE.,"in metrical language? To this it will be answered, that a very small"
423,PREFACE.,"part of the pleasure given by Poetry depends upon the metre, and"
424,PREFACE.,that it is injudicious to write in metre unless it be accompanied
425,PREFACE.,with the other artificial distinctions of style with which metre is
426,PREFACE.,"usually accompanied, and that by such deviation more will be lost"
427,PREFACE.,from the shock which will be thereby given to the Reader's
428,PREFACE.,associations than will be counterbalanced by any pleasure which he
429,PREFACE.,can derive from the general power of numbers. In answer to those who
430,PREFACE.,thus contend for the necessity of accompanying metre with certain
431,PREFACE.,appropriate colours of style in order to the accomplishment of its
432,PREFACE.,"appropriate end, and who also, in my opinion, greatly under-rate the"
433,PREFACE.,"power of metre in itself, it might perhaps be almost sufficient to"
434,PREFACE.,"observe that poems are extant, written upon more humble subjects,"
435,PREFACE.,"and in a more naked and simple style than what I have aimed at,"
436,PREFACE.,which poems have continued to give pleasure from generation to
437,PREFACE.,"generation. Now, if nakedness and simplicity be a defect, the fact"
438,PREFACE.,here mentioned affords a strong presumption that poems somewhat less
439,PREFACE.,naked and simple are capable of affording pleasure at the present day;
440,PREFACE.,and all that I am now attempting is to justify myself for having
441,PREFACE.,written under the impression of this belief.
442,PREFACE.,
443,PREFACE.,"But I might point out various causes why, when the style is manly,"
444,PREFACE.,"and the subject of some importance, words metrically arranged will"
445,PREFACE.,long continue to impart such a pleasure to mankind as he who is
446,PREFACE.,sensible of the extent of that pleasure will be desirous to impart.
447,PREFACE.,The end of Poetry is to produce excitement in coexistence with an
448,PREFACE.,"overbalance of pleasure. Now, by the supposition, excitement is an"
449,PREFACE.,unusual and irregular state of the mind; ideas and feelings do not
450,PREFACE.,in that state succeed each other in accustomed order. But if the
451,PREFACE.,"words by which this excitement is produced are in themselves powerful,"
452,PREFACE.,or the images and feelings have an undue proportion of pain connected
453,PREFACE.,"with them, there is some danger that the excitement may be carried"
454,PREFACE.,"beyond its proper bounds. Now the co-presence of something regular,"
455,PREFACE.,something to which the mind has been accustomed when in an unexcited
456,PREFACE.,"or a less excited state, cannot but have great efficacy in tempering"
457,PREFACE.,and restraining the passion by an intertexture of ordinary feeling.
458,PREFACE.,This may be illustrated by appealing to the Reader's own experience
459,PREFACE.,of the reluctance with which he comes to the re-perusal of the
460,PREFACE.,"distressful parts of Clarissa Harlowe, or the Gamester. While"
461,PREFACE.,"Shakespeare's writings, in the most pathetic scenes, never act upon"
462,PREFACE.,us as pathetic beyond the bounds of pleasure--an effect which is in
463,PREFACE.,"a great degree to be ascribed to small, but continual and regular"
464,PREFACE.,impulses of pleasurable surprise from the metrical arrangement.--On
465,PREFACE.,the other hand (what it must be allowed will much more frequently
466,PREFACE.,"happen) if the Poet's words should be incommensurate with the passion,"
467,PREFACE.,and inadequate to raise the Reader to a height of desirable
468,PREFACE.,"excitement, then, (unless the Poet's choice of his metre has been"
469,PREFACE.,grossly injudicious) in the feelings of pleasure which the Reader
470,PREFACE.,"has been accustomed to connect with metre in general, and in the"
471,PREFACE.,"feeling, whether chearful or melancholy, which he has been"
472,PREFACE.,"accustomed to connect with that particular movement of metre, there"
473,PREFACE.,will be found something which will greatly contribute to impart
474,PREFACE.,"passion to the words, and to effect the complex end which the Poet"
475,PREFACE.,proposes to himself.
476,PREFACE.,
477,PREFACE.,If I had undertaken a systematic defence of the theory upon which
478,PREFACE.,"these poems are written, it would have been my duty to develope the"
479,PREFACE.,various causes upon which the pleasure received from metrical
480,PREFACE.,language depends. Among the chief of these causes is to be reckoned
481,PREFACE.,a principle which must be well known to those who have made any of
482,PREFACE.,the Arts the object of accurate reflection; I mean the pleasure
483,PREFACE.,which the mind derives from the perception of similitude in
484,PREFACE.,dissimilitude. This principle is the great spring of the activity of
485,PREFACE.,our minds and their chief feeder. From this principle the direction
486,PREFACE.,"of the sexual appetite, and all the passions connected with it take"
487,PREFACE.,their origin: It is the life of our ordinary conversation; and upon
488,PREFACE.,"the accuracy with which similitude in dissimilitude, and"
489,PREFACE.,"dissimilitude in similitude are perceived, depend our taste and our"
490,PREFACE.,moral feelings. It would not have been a useless employment to have
491,PREFACE.,"applied this principle to the consideration of metre, and to have"
492,PREFACE.,"shewn that metre is hence enabled to afford much pleasure, and to"
493,PREFACE.,have pointed out in what manner that pleasure is produced. But my
494,PREFACE.,"limits will not permit me to enter upon this subject, and I must"
495,PREFACE.,content myself with a general summary.
496,PREFACE.,
497,PREFACE.,I have said that Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful
498,PREFACE.,feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in
499,PREFACE.,tranquillity: the emotion is contemplated till by a species of
500,PREFACE.,"reaction the tranquillity gradually disappears, and an emotion,"
501,PREFACE.,"similar to that which was before the subject of contemplation, is"
502,PREFACE.,"gradually produced, and does itself actually exist in the mind. In"
503,PREFACE.,"this mood successful composition generally begins, and in a mood"
504,PREFACE.,"similar to this it is carried on; but the emotion, of whatever kind"
505,PREFACE.,"and in whatever degree, from various causes is qualified by various"
506,PREFACE.,"pleasures, so that in describing any passions whatsoever, which are"
507,PREFACE.,"voluntarily described, the mind will upon the whole be in a state of"
508,PREFACE.,enjoyment. Now if Nature be thus cautious in preserving in a state
509,PREFACE.,"of enjoyment a being thus employed, the Poet ought to profit by the"
510,PREFACE.,"lesson thus held forth to him, and ought especially to take care,"
511,PREFACE.,"that whatever passions he communicates to his Reader, those passions,"
512,PREFACE.,"if his Reader's mind be sound and vigorous, should always be"
513,PREFACE.,accompanied with an overbalance of pleasure. Now the music of
514,PREFACE.,"harmonious metrical language, the sense of difficulty overcome, and"
515,PREFACE.,the blind association of pleasure which has been previously received
516,PREFACE.,"from works of rhyme or metre of the same or similar construction,"
517,PREFACE.,"all these imperceptibly make up a complex feeling of delight, which"
518,PREFACE.,is of the most important use in tempering the painful feeling which
519,PREFACE.,will always be found intermingled with powerful descriptions of the
520,PREFACE.,deeper passions. This effect is always produced in pathetic and
521,PREFACE.,impassioned poetry; while in lighter compositions the ease and
522,PREFACE.,gracefulness with which the Poet manages his numbers are themselves
523,PREFACE.,confessedly a principal source of the gratification of the Reader. I
524,PREFACE.,might perhaps include all which it is _necessary_ to say upon this
525,PREFACE.,"subject by affirming what few persons will deny, that of two"
526,PREFACE.,"descriptions either of passions, manners, or characters, each of"
527,PREFACE.,"them equally well executed, the one in prose and the other in verse,"
528,PREFACE.,the verse will be read a hundred times where the prose is read once.
529,PREFACE.,"We see that Pope by the power of verse alone, has contrived to"
530,PREFACE.,"render the plainest common sense interesting, and even frequently to"
531,PREFACE.,invest it with the appearance of passion. In consequence of these
532,PREFACE.,"convictions I related in metre the Tale of GOODY BLAKE and HARRY GILL,"
533,PREFACE.,which is one of the rudest of this collection. I wished to draw
534,PREFACE.,attention to the truth that the power of the human imagination is
535,PREFACE.,sufficient to produce such changes even in our physical nature as
536,PREFACE.,might almost appear miraculous. The truth is an important one; the
537,PREFACE.,fact (for it is a _fact_) is a valuable illustration of it. And I
538,PREFACE.,have the satisfaction of knowing that it has been communicated to
539,PREFACE.,"many hundreds of people who would never have heard of it, had it not"
540,PREFACE.,"been narrated as a Ballad, and in a more impressive metre than is"
541,PREFACE.,usual in Ballads.
542,PREFACE.,
543,PREFACE.,Having thus adverted to a few of the reasons why I have written in
544,PREFACE.,"verse, and why I have chosen subjects from common life, and"
545,PREFACE.,"endeavoured to bring my language near to the real language of men,"
546,PREFACE.,"if I have been too minute in pleading my own cause, I have at the"
547,PREFACE.,same time been treating a subject of general interest; and it is for
548,PREFACE.,this reason that I request the Reader's permission to add a few
549,PREFACE.,"words with reference solely to these particular poems, and to some"
550,PREFACE.,defects which will probably be found in them. I am sensible that my
551,PREFACE.,"associations must have sometimes been particular instead of general,"
552,PREFACE.,"and that, consequently, giving to things a false importance,"
553,PREFACE.,sometimes from diseased impulses I may have written upon unworthy
554,PREFACE.,"subject; but I am less apprehensive on this account, than that my"
555,PREFACE.,language may frequently have suffered from those arbitrary
556,PREFACE.,"connections of feelings and ideas with particular words, from which"
557,PREFACE.,no man can altogether protect himself. Hence I have no doubt that in
558,PREFACE.,some instances feelings even of the ludicrous may be given to my
559,PREFACE.,Readers by expressions which appeared to me tender and pathetic.
560,PREFACE.,"Such faulty expressions, were I convinced they were faulty at present,"
561,PREFACE.,"and that they must necessarily continue to be so, I would willingly"
562,PREFACE.,take all reasonable pains to correct. But it is dangerous to make
563,PREFACE.,"these alterations on the simple authority of a few individuals, or"
564,PREFACE.,even of certain classes of men; for where the understanding of an
565,PREFACE.,"Author is not convinced, or his feelings altered, this cannot be"
566,PREFACE.,done without great injury to himself: for his own feelings are his
567,PREFACE.,"stay and support, and if he sets them aside in one instance, he may"
568,PREFACE.,be induced to repeat this act till his mind loses all confidence in
569,PREFACE.,"itself and becomes utterly debilitated. To this it may be added,"
570,PREFACE.,that the Reader ought never to forget that he is himself exposed to
571,PREFACE.,"the same errors as the Poet, and perhaps in a much greater degree:"
572,PREFACE.,for there can be no presumption in saying that it is not probable he
573,PREFACE.,will be so well acquainted with the various stages of meaning
574,PREFACE.,"through which words have passed, or with the fickleness or stability"
575,PREFACE.,"of the relations of particular ideas to each other; and above all,"
576,PREFACE.,"since he is so much less interested in the subject, he may decide"
577,PREFACE.,lightly and carelessly.
578,PREFACE.,
579,PREFACE.,"Long as I have detained my Reader, I hope he will permit me to"
580,PREFACE.,caution him against a mode of false criticism which has been applied
581,PREFACE.,to Poetry in which the language closely resembles that of life and
582,PREFACE.,nature. Such verses have been triumphed over in parodies of which
583,PREFACE.,Dr. Johnson's Stanza is a fair specimen.
584,PREFACE.,
585,PREFACE.,"""I put my hat upon my head,"
586,PREFACE.,"And walk'd into the Strand,"
587,PREFACE.,And there I met another man
588,PREFACE.,"Whose hat was in his hand."""
589,PREFACE.,
590,PREFACE.,Immediately under these lines I will place one of the most justly
591,PREFACE.,"admired stanzas of the ""_Babes_ in the Wood."""
592,PREFACE.,
593,PREFACE.,"""These pretty Babes with hand in hand"
594,PREFACE.,Went wandering up and down;
595,PREFACE.,But never more they saw the Man
596,PREFACE.,"Approaching from the Town."""
597,PREFACE.,
598,PREFACE.,"In both of these stanzas the words, and the order of the words, in"
599,PREFACE.,no respect differ from the most unimpassioned conversation. There
600,PREFACE.,"are words in both, for example, ""the Strand,"" and ""the Town,"""
601,PREFACE.,connected with none but the most familiar ideas; yet the one stanza
602,PREFACE.,"we admit as admirable, and the other as a fair example of the"
603,PREFACE.,superlatively contemptible. Whence arises this difference? Not from
604,PREFACE.,"the metre, not from the language, not from the order of the words;"
605,PREFACE.,but the _matter_ expressed in Dr. Johnson's stanza is contemptible.
606,PREFACE.,The proper method of treating trivial and simple verses to which
607,PREFACE.,Dr. Johnson's stanza would be a fair parallelism is not to say this
608,PREFACE.,"is a bad kind of poetry, or this is not poetry, but this wants sense;"
609,PREFACE.,"it is neither interesting in itself, nor can _lead_ to any thing"
610,PREFACE.,interesting; the images neither originate in that sane state of
611,PREFACE.,"feeling which arises out of thought, nor can excite thought or"
612,PREFACE.,feeling in the Reader. This is the only sensible manner of dealing
613,PREFACE.,with such verses: Why trouble yourself about the species till you
614,PREFACE.,have previously decided upon the genus? Why take pains to prove that
615,PREFACE.,an Ape is not a Newton when it is self-evident that he is not a man.
616,PREFACE.,
617,PREFACE.,"I have one request to make of my Reader, which is, that in judging"
618,PREFACE.,"these Poems he would decide by his own feelings genuinely, and not"
619,PREFACE.,by reflection upon what will probably be the judgment of others. How
620,PREFACE.,"common is it to hear a person say, ""I myself do not object to this"
621,PREFACE.,"style of composition or this or that expression, but to such and"
622,PREFACE.,"such classes of people it will appear mean or ludicrous."" This mode"
623,PREFACE.,of criticism so destructive of all sound unadulterated judgment is
624,PREFACE.,almost universal: I have therefore to request that the Reader would
625,PREFACE.,"abide independently by his own feelings, and that if he finds"
626,PREFACE.,himself affected he would not suffer such conjectures to interfere
627,PREFACE.,with his pleasure.
628,PREFACE.,
629,PREFACE.,If an Author by any single composition has impressed us with respect
630,PREFACE.,"for his talents, it is useful to consider this as affording a"
631,PREFACE.,"presumption, that, on other occasions where we have been displeased,"
632,PREFACE.,"he nevertheless may not have written ill or absurdly; and, further,"
633,PREFACE.,to give him so much credit for this one composition as may induce us
634,PREFACE.,to review what has displeased us with more care than we should
635,PREFACE.,"otherwise have bestowed upon it. This is not only an act of justice,"
636,PREFACE.,"but in our decisions upon poetry especially, may conduce in a high"
637,PREFACE.,degree to the improvement of our own taste: for an _accurate_ taste
638,PREFACE.,"in Poetry and in all the other arts, as Sir Joshua Reynolds has"
639,PREFACE.,"observed, is an _acquired_ talent, which can only be produced by"
640,PREFACE.,thought and a long continued intercourse with the best models of
641,PREFACE.,composition. This is mentioned not with so ridiculous a purpose as
642,PREFACE.,"to prevent the most inexperienced Reader from judging for himself,"
643,PREFACE.,(I have already said that I wish him to judge for himself;) but
644,PREFACE.,"merely to temper the rashness of decision, and to suggest that if"
645,PREFACE.,"Poetry be a subject on which much time has not been bestowed, the"
646,PREFACE.,"judgment may be erroneous, and that in many cases it necessarily"
647,PREFACE.,will be so.
648,PREFACE.,
649,PREFACE.,I know that nothing would have so effectually contributed to further
650,PREFACE.,the end which I have in view as to have shewn of what kind the
651,PREFACE.,"pleasure is, and how the pleasure is produced which is confessedly"
652,PREFACE.,produced by metrical composition essentially different from what I
653,PREFACE.,have here endeavoured to recommend; for the Reader will say that he
654,PREFACE.,has been pleased by such composition and what can I do more for him?
655,PREFACE.,The power of any art is limited and he will suspect that if I propose
656,PREFACE.,to furnish him with new friends it is only upon condition of his
657,PREFACE.,"abandoning his old friends. Besides, as I have said, the Reader is"
658,PREFACE.,himself conscious of the pleasure which he has received from such
659,PREFACE.,"composition, composition to which he has peculiarly attached the"
660,PREFACE.,"endearing name of Poetry; and all men feel an habitual gratitude,"
661,PREFACE.,and something of an honorable bigotry for the objects which have
662,PREFACE.,"long continued to please them: we not only wish to be pleased, but"
663,PREFACE.,to be pleased in that particular way in which we have been
664,PREFACE.,accustomed to be pleased. There is a host of arguments in these
665,PREFACE.,"feelings; and I should be the less able to combat them successfully,"
666,PREFACE.,"as I am willing to allow, that, in order entirely to enjoy the"
667,PREFACE.,"Poetry which I am recommending, it would be necessary to give up"
668,PREFACE.,much of what is ordinarily enjoyed. But would my limits have
669,PREFACE.,"permitted me to point out how this pleasure is produced, I might"
670,PREFACE.,"have removed many obstacles, and assisted my Reader in perceiving"
671,PREFACE.,that the powers of language are not so limited as he may suppose; and
672,PREFACE.,"that it is possible that poetry may give other enjoyments, of a purer,"
673,PREFACE.,"more lasting, and more exquisite nature. But this part of my subject"
674,PREFACE.,I have been obliged altogether to omit: as it has been less my
675,PREFACE.,present aim to prove that the interest excited by some other kinds
676,PREFACE.,"of poetry is less vivid, and less worthy of the nobler powers of the"
677,PREFACE.,"mind, than to offer reasons for presuming, that, if the object which"
678,PREFACE.,"I have proposed to myself were adequately attained, a species of"
679,PREFACE.,"poetry would be produced, which is genuine poetry; in its nature"
680,PREFACE.,"well adapted to interest mankind permanently, and likewise important"
681,PREFACE.,in the multiplicity and quality of its moral relations. From what
682,PREFACE.,"has been said, and from a perusal of the Poems, the Reader will be"
683,PREFACE.,able clearly to perceive the object which I have proposed to myself:
684,PREFACE.,"he will determine how far I have attained this object; and, what is"
685,PREFACE.,"a much more important question, whether it be worth attaining; and"
686,PREFACE.,upon the decision of these two questions will rest my claim to the
687,PREFACE.,approbation of the public.

1536,XII.,Poor Martha! on that woful day
1537,XII.,"A cruel, cruel fire, they say,"

1564,XIV.,"Last Christmas when we talked of this,"

1611,XVII.,"When to this country first I came,"

2053,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"And now to the sea-coast, with numbers more, we drew."
2054,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2055,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"There foul neglect for months and months we bore,"
2056,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Nor yet the crowded fleet its anchor stirred.
2057,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Green fields before us and our native shore,"
2058,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"By fever, from polluted air incurred,"
2059,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Ravage was made, for which no knell was heard."
2060,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Fondly we wished, and wished away, nor knew,"
2061,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"'Mid that long sickness, and those hopes deferr'd,"
2062,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,That happier days we never more must view:
2063,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"The parting signal streamed, at last the land withdrew."
2064,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2065,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,But from delay the summer calms were past.
2066,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"On as we drove, the equinoctial deep"
2067,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Ran mountains-high before the howling blast.
2068,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,We gazed with terror on the gloomy sleep
2069,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Of them that perished in the whirlwind's sweep,"
2070,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Untaught that soon such anguish must ensue,"
2071,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Our hopes such harvest of affliction reap,"
2072,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,That we the mercy of the waves should rue.
2073,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"We readied the western world, a poor, devoted crew."
2074,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2075,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Oh I dreadful price of being to resign
2076,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,All that is dear _in_ being! better far
2077,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"In Want's most lonely cave till death to pine,"
2078,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Unseen, unheard, unwatched by any star;"
2079,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Or in the streets and walks where proud men are,"
2080,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Better our dying bodies to obtrude,"
2081,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Than dog-like, wading at the heels of war,"
2082,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Protract a curst existence, with the brood"
2083,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,That lap (their very nourishment!) their brother's blood.
2084,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2085,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,The pains and plagues that on our heads came down;
2086,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Disease and famine, agony and fear,"
2087,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"In wood or wilderness, in camp or town,"
2088,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,It would thy brain unsettle even to hear.
2089,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"All perished--all, in one remorseless year,"
2090,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Husband and children! one by one, by sword"
2091,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"And ravenous plague, all perished: every tear"
2092,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Dried up, despairing, desolate, on board"
2093,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"A British ship I waked, as from a trance restored."
2094,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2095,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Peaceful as some immeasurable plain
2096,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,By the first beams of dawning light impress'd;
2097,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"In the calm sunshine slept the glittering main,"
2098,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"The very ocean has its hour of rest,"
2099,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,That comes not to the human mourner's breast.
2100,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Remote from man, and storms of mortal care,"
2101,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,A heavenly silence did the waves invest:
2102,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"I looked and looked along the silent air,"
2103,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Until it seemed to bring a joy to my despair.
2104,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2105,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Ah! how unlike those late terrific sleeps!
2106,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"And groans, that rage of racking famine spoke:"
2107,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,The unburied dead that lay in festering heaps!
2108,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,The breathing pestilence that rose like smoke!
2109,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,The shriek that from the distant battle broke!
2110,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"The mine's dire earthquake, and the pallid host"
2111,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Driven by the bomb's incessant thunder-stroke
2112,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"To loathsome vaults, where heart-sick anguish toss'd,"
2113,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Hope died, and fear itself in agony was lost!"
2114,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2115,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Yet does that burst of woe congeal my frame,"
2116,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"When the dark streets appeared to heave and gape,"
2117,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"While like a sea the storming army came,"
2118,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"And Fire from hell reared his gigantic shape,"
2119,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"And Murder, by the ghastly gleam, and Rape"
2120,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Seized their joint prey, the mother and the child!"
2121,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"But from these crazing thoughts my brain, escape!"
2122,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"--For weeks the balmy air breathed soft and mild,"
2123,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,And on the gliding vessel Heaven and Ocean smiled.
2124,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2125,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Some mighty gulph of separation past,"
2126,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,I seemed transported to another world:--
2127,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"A thought resigned with pain, when from the mast"
2128,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"The impatient mariner the sail unfurl'd,"
2129,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"And whistling, called the wind that hardly curled"
2130,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"The silent sea. From the sweet thoughts of home,"
2131,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,And from all hope I was forever hurled.
2132,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,For me--farthest from earthly port to roam
2133,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Was best, could I but shun the spot where man might"
2134,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,come.
2135,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2136,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"And oft, robb'd of my perfect mind, I thought"
2137,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,At last my feet a resting-place had found:
2138,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Here will I weep in peace, (so fancy wrought,)"
2139,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Roaming the illimitable waters round;
2140,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Here watch, of every human friend disowned,"
2141,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"All day, my ready tomb the ocean-flood--"
2142,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,To break my dream the vessel reached its bound:
2143,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"And homeless near a thousand homes I stood,"
2144,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"And near a thousand tables pined, and wanted food."
2145,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2146,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"By grief enfeebled was I turned adrift,"
2147,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Helpless as sailor cast on desert rock;
2148,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Nor morsel to my mouth that day did lift,"
2149,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Nor dared my hand at any door to knock.
2150,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"I lay, where with his drowsy mates, the cock"
2151,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,From the cross timber of an out-house hung;
2152,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"How dismal tolled, that night, the city clock!"
2153,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"At morn my sick heart hunger scarcely stung,"
2154,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Nor to the beggar's language could I frame my tongue.
2155,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2156,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"So passed another day, and so the third:"
2157,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Then did I try, in vain, the crowd's resort,"
2158,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"In deep despair by frightful wishes stirr'd,"
2159,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Near the sea-side I reached a ruined fort:
2160,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"There, pains which nature could no more support,"
2161,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"With blindness linked, did on my vitals fall;"
2162,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Dizzy my brain, with interruption short"
2163,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Of hideous sense; I sunk, nor step could crawl,"
2164,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,And thence was borne away to neighbouring hospital.
2165,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2166,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Recovery came with food: but still, my brain"
2167,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Was weak, nor of the past had memory."
2168,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"I heard my neighbours, in their beds, complain"
2169,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Of many things which never troubled me;
2170,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Of feet still bustling round with busy glee,"
2171,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Of looks where common kindness had no part.
2172,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Of service done with careless cruelty,"
2173,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Fretting the fever round the languid heart,"
2174,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"And groans, which, as they said, would make a dead man start."
2175,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2176,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"These things just served to stir the torpid sense,"
2177,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Nor pain nor pity in my bosom raised.
2178,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Memory, though slow, returned with strength: and thence"
2179,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Dismissed, again on open day I gazed,"
2180,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"At houses, men, and common light, amazed."
2181,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"The lanes I sought, and as the sun retired,"
2182,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Came, where beneath the trees a faggot blazed;"
2183,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"The wild brood saw me weep, my fate enquired,"
2184,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"And gave me food, and rest, more welcome, more desired."
2185,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2186,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"My heart is touched to think that men like these,"
2187,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"The rude earth's tenants, were my first relief:"
2188,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,How kindly did they paint their vagrant ease!
2189,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"And their long holiday that feared not grief,"
2190,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"For all belonged to all, and each was chief."
2191,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,No plough their sinews strained; on grating road
2192,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"No wain they drove, and yet, the yellow sheaf"
2193,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,In every vale for their delight was stowed:
2194,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"For them, in nature's meads, the milky udder flowed,"
2195,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2196,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Semblance, with straw and panniered ass, they made"
2197,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Of potters wandering on from door to door:
2198,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"But life of happier sort to me pourtrayed,"
2199,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,And other joys my fancy to allure;
2200,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,The bag-pipe dinning on the midnight moor
2201,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"In barn uplighted, and companions boon"
2202,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Well met from far with revelry secure,"
2203,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"In depth of forest glade, when jocund June"
2204,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Rolled fast along the sky his warm and genial moon.
2205,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2206,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"But ill it suited me, in journey dark"
2207,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"O'er moor and mountain, midnight theft to hatch;"
2208,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"To charm the surly house-dog's faithful bark,"
2209,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Or hang on tiptoe at the lifted latch;
2210,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"The gloomy lantern, and the dim blue match,"
2211,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"The black disguise, the warning whistle shrill,"
2212,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"And ear still busy on its nightly watch,"
2213,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Were not for me, brought up in nothing ill;"
2214,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Besides, on griefs so fresh my thoughts were brooding still."
2215,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2216,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"What could I do, unaided and unblest?"
2217,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Poor Father! gone was every friend of thine:
2218,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,And kindred of dead husband are at best
2219,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Small help, and, after marriage such as mine,"
2220,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,With little kindness would to me incline.
2221,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Ill was I then for toil or service fit:
2222,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"With tears whose course no effort could confine,"
2223,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,By high-way side forgetful would I sit
2224,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Whole hours, my idle arms in moping sorrow knit."
2225,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2226,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,I lived upon the mercy of the fields
2227,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,And oft of cruelty the sky accused;
2228,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"On hazard, or what general bounty yields."
2229,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Now coldly given, now utterly refused,"
2230,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,The fields I for my bed have often used:
2231,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"But, what afflicts my peace with keenest ruth"
2232,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Is, that I have my inner self abused,"
2233,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Foregone the home delight of constant truth,"
2234,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"And clear and open soul, so prized in fearless youth."
2235,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,
2236,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Three years a wanderer, often have I view'd,"
2237,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"In tears, the sun towards that country tend"
2238,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Where my poor heart lost all its fortitude:
2239,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,And now across this moor my steps I bend--
2240,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Oh! tell me whither--for no earthly friend
2241,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,"Have I.--She ceased, and weeping turned away,"
2242,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,As if because her tale was at an end
2243,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,She wept;--because she had no more to say
2244,_THE FEMALE VAGRANT_,Of that perpetual weight which on her spirit lay.

2252,_THE DUNGEON._,This is the process of our love and wisdom
2253,_THE DUNGEON._,To each poor brother who offends against us--
2254,_THE DUNGEON._,"Most innocent, perhaps--and what if guilty?"
2255,_THE DUNGEON._,Is this the only cure? Merciful God!
2256,_THE DUNGEON._,Each pore and natural outlet shrivell'd up
2257,_THE DUNGEON._,"By ignorance and parching poverty,"
2258,_THE DUNGEON._,"His energies roll back upon his heart,"

2260,_THE DUNGEON._,"They break out on him, like a loathsome plague spot."
2261,_THE DUNGEON._,Then we call in our pamper'd mountebanks--
2262,_THE DUNGEON._,And this is their best cure! uncomforted.
2263,_THE DUNGEON._,

2270,_THE DUNGEON._,By sights of ever more deformity!
2271,_THE DUNGEON._,
2272,_THE DUNGEON._,"With other ministrations thou, O nature!'"
2273,_THE DUNGEON._,Healest thy wandering and distempered child:
2274,_THE DUNGEON._,Thou pourest on him thy soft influences.
2275,_THE DUNGEON._,"Thy sunny hues, fair forms, and breathing sheets,"
2276,_THE DUNGEON._,"Thy melodies of woods, and winds, and waters,"
2277,_THE DUNGEON._,"Till he relent, and can no more endure"
2278,_THE DUNGEON._,"To be a jarring and a dissonant thing,"
2279,_THE DUNGEON._,Amid this general dance and minstrelsy;
2280,_THE DUNGEON._,"But, bursting into tears, wins back his way,"
2281,_THE DUNGEON._,His angry spirit healed and harmonized
2282,_THE DUNGEON._,By the benignant touch of love and beauty.

2412,_LINES,
2413,_LINES,"I heard a thousand blended notes,"
2414,_LINES,"While in a grove I sate reclined,"
2415,_LINES,In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
2416,_LINES,Bring sad thoughts to the mind.
2417,_LINES,
2418,_LINES,To her fair works did nature link
2419,_LINES,The human soul that through me ran;
2420,_LINES,And much it griev'd my heart to think
2421,_LINES,What man has made of man.
2422,_LINES,
2423,_LINES,"Through primrose tufts, in that sweet bower,"
2424,_LINES,The periwinkle trail'd its wreathes;
2425,_LINES,And 'tis my faith that every flower
2426,_LINES,Enjoys the air it breathes.
2427,_LINES,
2428,_LINES,The birds around me hopp'd and play'd:
2429,_LINES,"Their thoughts I cannot measure,"
2430,_LINES,"But the least motion which they made,"
2431,_LINES,It seem'd a thrill of pleasure.
2432,_LINES,
2433,_LINES,"The budding twigs spread out their fan,"
2434,_LINES,To catch the breezy air;
2435,_LINES,"And I must think, do all I can,"
2436,_LINES,That there was pleasure there.
2437,_LINES,
2438,_LINES,"If I these thoughts may not prevent,"

2447,_LINES,"Written in April, 1798._"
2448,_LINES,
2449,_LINES,"No cloud, no relique of the sunken day"
2450,_LINES,"Distinguishes the West, no long thin slip"
2451,_LINES,"Of sullen Light, no obscure trembling hues."
2452,_LINES,"Come, we will rest on this old mossy Bridge!"
2453,_LINES,"You see the glimmer of the stream beneath,"
2454,_LINES,But hear no murmuring: it flows silently
2455,_LINES,"O'er its soft bed of verdure. All is still,"
2456,_LINES,"A balmy night! and tho' the stars be dim,"
2457,_LINES,Yet let us think upon the vernal showers
2458,_LINES,"That gladden the green earth, and we shall find"
2459,_LINES,A pleasure in the dimness of the stars.
2460,_LINES,
2461,_LINES,And hark! the Nightingale begins its song
2462,_LINES,"""Most musical, most melancholy"" [4] Bird!"
2463,_LINES,A melancholy Bird? O idle thought!
2464,_LINES,In nature there is nothing melancholy.
2465,_LINES,"--But some night wandering Man, whose heart was pierc'd"
2466,_LINES,"With the remembrance of a grievous wrong,"
2467,_LINES,"Or slow distemper or neglected love,"
2468,_LINES,"(And so, poor Wretch! fill'd all things with himself"
2469,_LINES,And made all gentle sounds tell back the tale
2470,_LINES,Of his own sorrows) he and such as he
2471,_LINES,First named these notes a melancholy strain:
2472,_LINES,And many a poet echoes the conceit;
2473,_LINES,"Poet, who hath been building up the rhyme"
2474,_LINES,
2475,_LINES,"[Footnote 4: ""_Most musical, most melancholy_."" This passage in"
2476,_LINES,Milton possesses an excellence far superior to that of mere
2477,_LINES,"description: it is spoken in the character of the melancholy Man,"
2478,_LINES,and has therefore a _dramatic_ propriety. The Author makes this
2479,_LINES,"remark, to rescue himself from the charge of having alluded with"
2480,_LINES,levity to a line in Milton: a charge than which none could be more
2481,_LINES,"painful to him, except perhaps that of having ridiculed his Bible.]"
2482,_LINES,
2483,_LINES,When he had better far have stretch'd his limbs
2484,_LINES,Beside a 'brook in mossy forest-dell
2485,_LINES,"By sun or moonlight, to the influxes"
2486,_LINES,Of shapes and sounds and shifting elements
2487,_LINES,"Surrendering his whole spirit, of his song"
2488,_LINES,And of his fame forgetful! so his fame
2489,_LINES,"Should share in nature's immortality,"
2490,_LINES,A venerable thing! and so his song
2491,_LINES,"Should make all nature lovelier, and itself"
2492,_LINES,"Be lov'd, like nature!--But 'twill not be so;"
2493,_LINES,And youths and maidens most poetical
2494,_LINES,Who lose the deep'ning twilights of the spring
2495,_LINES,"In ball-rooms and hot theatres, they still"
2496,_LINES,Full of meek sympathy must heave their sighs
2497,_LINES,O'er Philomela's pity-pleading strains.
2498,_LINES,"My Friend, and my Friend's Sister! we have learnt"
2499,_LINES,A different lore: we may not thus profane
2500,_LINES,Nature's sweet voices always full of love
2501,_LINES,And joyance! Tis the merry Nightingale
2502,_LINES,
2503,_LINES,"That crowds, and hurries, and precipitates"
2504,_LINES,"With fast thick warble his delicious notes,"
2505,_LINES,"As he were fearful, that an April night"
2506,_LINES,Would be too short for him to utter forth
2507,_LINES,"Hi? love-chant, and disburthen his full soul"
2508,_LINES,Of all its music! And I know a grove
2509,_LINES,"Of large extent, hard by a castle huge"
2510,_LINES,Which the great lord inhabits not: and so
2511,_LINES,"This grove is wild with tangling underwood,"
2512,_LINES,"And the trim walks are broken up, and grass,"
2513,_LINES,Thin grass and king-cups grow within the paths.
2514,_LINES,But never elsewhere in one place I knew
2515,_LINES,So many Nightingales: and far and near
2516,_LINES,In wood and thicket over the wide grove
2517,_LINES,They answer and provoke each other's songs--
2518,_LINES,"With skirmish and capricious passagings,"
2519,_LINES,And murmurs musical and swift jug jug
2520,_LINES,And one low piping sound more sweet than all--
2521,_LINES,"Stirring the air with such an harmony,"
2522,_LINES,"That should you close your eyes, you might almost"
2523,_LINES,Forget it was not day!
2524,_LINES,
2525,_LINES,A most gentle maid
2526,_LINES,Who dwelleth in her hospitable home
2527,_LINES,"Hard by the Castle, and at latest eve,"
2528,_LINES,(Even like a Lady vow'd and dedicate
2529,_LINES,To something more than nature in the grove)
2530,_LINES,"Glides thro' the pathways; she knows all their notes,"
2531,_LINES,"That gentle Maid! and oft, a moment's space,"
2532,_LINES,"What time the moon was lost behind a cloud,"
2533,_LINES,Hath heard a pause of silence: till the Moon
2534,_LINES,"Emerging, hath awaken'd earth and sky"
2535,_LINES,"With one sensation, and those wakeful Birds"
2536,_LINES,"Have all burst forth in choral minstrelsy,"
2537,_LINES,At if one quick and sudden Gale had swept
2538,_LINES,An hundred airy harps! And she hath watch'd
2539,_LINES,Many a Nightingale perch giddily
2540,_LINES,"On blosmy twig still swinging from the breeze,"
2541,_LINES,"And to that motion tune his wanton song,"
2542,_LINES,Like tipsy Joy that reels with tossing head.
2543,_LINES,
2544,_LINES,"Farewell, O Warbler! till to-morrow eve,"
2545,_LINES,"And you, my friends! farewell, a short farewell!"
2546,_LINES,"We have been loitering long and pleasantly,"
2547,_LINES,And now for our dear homes.--That strain again!
2548,_LINES,"Full fain it would delay me!-My dear Babe,"
2549,_LINES,"Who, capable of no articulate sound,"
2550,_LINES,"Mars all things with his imitative lisp,"
2551,_LINES,"How he would place his hand beside his ear,"
2552,_LINES,"His little hand, the small forefinger up,"
2553,_LINES,And bid us listen! And I deem it wise
2554,_LINES,To make him Nature's playmate. He knows well
2555,_LINES,The evening star: and once when he awoke
2556,_LINES,In most distressful mood (some inward pain
2557,_LINES,"Had made up that strange thing, an infant's dream)"
2558,_LINES,"I hurried with him to our orchard plot,"
2559,_LINES,"And he beholds the moon, and hush'd at once"
2560,_LINES,"Suspends his sobs, and laughs most silently,"
2561,_LINES,While his fair eyes that swam with undropt tears
2562,_LINES,Did glitter in the yellow moon-beam!  Well--
2563,_LINES,It is a father's tale. But if that Heaven
2564,_LINES,"Should give me life, his childhood shall grow up"
2565,_LINES,"Familiar with these songs, that with the night"
2566,_LINES,"He may associate Joy! Once more farewell,"
2567,_LINES,"Sweet Nightingale! once more, my friends! farewell."

2577,_LINES,"While, facing thus the crimson west,"
2578,_LINES,The boat her silent path pursues!
2579,_LINES,And see how dark the backward stream!
2580,_LINES,"A little moment past, so smiling!"
2581,_LINES,"And still, perhaps, with faithless gleam,"
2582,_LINES,Some other loiterer beguiling.
2583,_LINES,
2584,_LINES,"Such views the youthful bard allure,"

2613,_LINES,"Who, pouring here a _later_ ditty,"

2617,_LINES,"Remembrance! as we float along,"

2644,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2645,THE IDIOT BOY.,"--Why bustle thus about your door,"
2646,THE IDIOT BOY.,"What means this bustle, Betty Foy?"
2647,THE IDIOT BOY.,Why are you in this mighty fret?
2648,THE IDIOT BOY.,And why on horseback have you set
2649,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Him whom you love, your idiot boy?"
2650,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2651,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Beneath the moon that shines so bright,"
2652,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Till she is tired, let Betty Foy"
2653,THE IDIOT BOY.,With girt and stirrup fiddle-faddle;
2654,THE IDIOT BOY.,But wherefore set upon a saddle
2655,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Him whom she loves, her idiot boy?"
2656,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2657,THE IDIOT BOY.,There's scarce a soul that's out of bed;
2658,THE IDIOT BOY.,Good Betty put him down again;
2659,THE IDIOT BOY.,"His lips with joy they burr at you,"
2660,THE IDIOT BOY.,"But, Betty! what has he to do"
2661,THE IDIOT BOY.,"With stirrup, saddle, or with rein?"
2662,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2663,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The world will say 'tis very idle,"
2664,THE IDIOT BOY.,Bethink you of the time of night;
2665,THE IDIOT BOY.,"There's not a mother, no not one,"

2667,THE IDIOT BOY.,Oh! Betty she'll be in a fright.
2668,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2669,THE IDIOT BOY.,"But Betty's bent on her intent,"
2670,THE IDIOT BOY.,"For her good neighbour, Susan Gale,"
2671,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Old Susan, she who dwells alone,"
2672,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Is sick, and makes a piteous moan,"

2674,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2675,THE IDIOT BOY.,"There's not a house within a mile,"
2676,THE IDIOT BOY.,No hand to help them in distress;
2677,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Old Susan lies a bed in pain,"
2678,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And sorely puzzled are the twain,"
2679,THE IDIOT BOY.,For what she ails they cannot guess.
2680,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2681,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And Betty's husband's at the wood,"
2682,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Where by the week he doth abide,"
2683,THE IDIOT BOY.,A woodman in the distant vale;
2684,THE IDIOT BOY.,"There's none to help poor Susan Gale,"
2685,THE IDIOT BOY.,What must be done? what will betide?
2686,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2687,THE IDIOT BOY.,And Betty from the lane has fetched
2688,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Her pony, that is mild and good,"
2689,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Whether he be in joy or pain,"
2690,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Feeding at will along the lane,"

2692,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2693,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And he is all in travelling trim,"
2694,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And by the moonlight, Betty Foy"
2695,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Has up upon the saddle set,"
2696,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The like was never heard of yet,"
2697,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Him whom she loves, her idiot boy."
2698,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2699,THE IDIOT BOY.,And he must post without delay
2700,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Across the bridge that's in the dale,"
2701,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And by the church, and o'er the down,"
2702,THE IDIOT BOY.,"To bring a doctor from the town,"
2703,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Or she will die, old Susan Gale."
2704,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2705,THE IDIOT BOY.,"There is no need of boot or spur,"
2706,THE IDIOT BOY.,"There is no need of whip or wand,"
2707,THE IDIOT BOY.,"For Johnny has his holly-bough,"
2708,THE IDIOT BOY.,And with a hurly-burly now
2709,THE IDIOT BOY.,He shakes the green bough in his hand.
2710,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2711,THE IDIOT BOY.,And Betty o'er and o'er has told
2712,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The boy who is her best delight,"
2713,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Both what to follow, what to shun,"
2714,THE IDIOT BOY.,"What do, and what to leave undone,"
2715,THE IDIOT BOY.,"How turn to left, and how to right."
2716,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2717,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And Betty's most especial charge,"
2718,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Was, ""Johnny! Johnny! mind that you"
2719,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Come home again, nor stop at all,"
2720,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Come home again, whate'er befal,"
2721,THE IDIOT BOY.,"My Johnny do, I pray you do."""
2722,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2723,THE IDIOT BOY.,"To this did Johnny answer make,"
2724,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Both with his head, and with his hand,"
2725,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And proudly shook the bridle too,"
2726,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And then! his words were not a few,"
2727,THE IDIOT BOY.,Which Betty well could understand.
2728,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2729,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And now that Johnny is just going,"
2730,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Though Betty's in a mighty flurry,"
2731,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She gently pats the pony's side,"
2732,THE IDIOT BOY.,"On which her idiot boy must ride,"
2733,THE IDIOT BOY.,And seems no longer in a hurry.
2734,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2735,THE IDIOT BOY.,"But when the pony moved his legs,"
2736,THE IDIOT BOY.,Oh! then for the poor idiot boy!
2737,THE IDIOT BOY.,"For joy he cannot hold the bridle,"
2738,THE IDIOT BOY.,"For joy his head and heels are idle,"
2739,THE IDIOT BOY.,He's idle all for very joy.
2740,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2741,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And while the pony moves his legs,"
2742,THE IDIOT BOY.,"In Johnny's left hand you may see,"
2743,THE IDIOT BOY.,The green bough's motionless and dead:
2744,THE IDIOT BOY.,The moon that shines above his head
2745,THE IDIOT BOY.,Is not more still and mute than he.
2746,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2747,THE IDIOT BOY.,"His heart it was so full of glee,"
2748,THE IDIOT BOY.,"That till full fifty yards were gone,"
2749,THE IDIOT BOY.,"He quite forgot his holly whip,"
2750,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And all his skill in horsemanship,"
2751,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Oh! happy, happy, happy John."
2752,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2753,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And Betty's standing at the door,"
2754,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And Betty's face with joy o'erflows,"
2755,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Proud of herself, and proud of him,"
2756,THE IDIOT BOY.,She sees him in his travelling trim;
2757,THE IDIOT BOY.,How quietly her Johnny goes.
2758,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2759,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The silence of her idiot boy,"
2760,THE IDIOT BOY.,What hopes it sends to Betty's heart!
2761,THE IDIOT BOY.,"He's at the guide-post--he turns right,"
2762,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She watches till he's out of sight,"
2763,THE IDIOT BOY.,And Betty will not then depart.
2764,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2765,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Burr, burr--now Johnny's lips they burr,"
2766,THE IDIOT BOY.,"As loud as any mill, or near it,"
2767,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Meek as a lamb the pony moves,"
2768,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And Johnny makes the noise he loves,"
2769,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And Betty listens, glad to hear it."
2770,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2771,THE IDIOT BOY.,Away she hies to Susan Gale:
2772,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And Johnny's in a merry tune,"
2773,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The owlets hoot, the owlets purr,"
2774,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And Johnny's lips they burr, burr, burr,"
2775,THE IDIOT BOY.,And on he goes beneath the moon.
2776,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2777,THE IDIOT BOY.,"His steed and he right well agree,"
2778,THE IDIOT BOY.,"For of this pony there's a rumour,"
2779,THE IDIOT BOY.,"That should he lose his eyes and ears,"
2780,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And should he live a thousand years,"
2781,THE IDIOT BOY.,He never will be out of humour.
2782,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2783,THE IDIOT BOY.,But then he is a horse that thinks!
2784,THE IDIOT BOY.,And when he thinks his pace is slack;
2785,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Now, though he knows poor Johnny well,"
2786,THE IDIOT BOY.,Yet for his life he cannot tell
2787,THE IDIOT BOY.,What he has got upon his back.
2788,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2789,THE IDIOT BOY.,"So through the moonlight lanes they go,"
2790,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And far into the moonlight dale,"
2791,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And by the church, and o'er the down,"
2792,THE IDIOT BOY.,"To bring a doctor from the town,"
2793,THE IDIOT BOY.,To comfort poor old Susan Gale.
2794,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2795,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And Betty, now at Susan's side,"
2796,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Is in the middle of her story,"
2797,THE IDIOT BOY.,"What comfort Johnny soon will bring,"
2798,THE IDIOT BOY.,"With many a most diverting thing,"
2799,THE IDIOT BOY.,Of Johnny's wit and Johnny's glory.
2800,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2801,THE IDIOT BOY.,And Betty's still at Susan's side:
2802,THE IDIOT BOY.,By this time she's not quite so flurried;
2803,THE IDIOT BOY.,Demure with porringer and plate
2804,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She sits, as if in Susan's fate"
2805,THE IDIOT BOY.,Her life and soul were buried.
2806,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2807,THE IDIOT BOY.,"But Betty, poor good woman! she,"
2808,THE IDIOT BOY.,"You plainly in her face may read it,"
2809,THE IDIOT BOY.,Could lend out of that moment's store
2810,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Five years of happiness or more,"
2811,THE IDIOT BOY.,To any that might need it.
2812,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2813,THE IDIOT BOY.,But yet I guess that now and then
2814,THE IDIOT BOY.,"With Betty all was not so well,"
2815,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And to the road she turns her ears,"
2816,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And thence full many a sound she hears,"
2817,THE IDIOT BOY.,Which she to Susan will not tell.
2818,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2819,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans,"
2820,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""As sure as there's a moon in heaven,"""
2821,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Cries Betty, ""he'll be back again;"
2822,THE IDIOT BOY.,"They'll both be here, 'tis almost ten,"
2823,THE IDIOT BOY.,"They'll both be here before eleven."""
2824,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2825,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans,"
2826,THE IDIOT BOY.,The clock gives warning for eleven;
2827,THE IDIOT BOY.,"'Tis on the stroke--""If Johnny's near,"""
2828,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Quoth Betty ""he will soon be here,"
2829,THE IDIOT BOY.,"As sure as there's a moon in heaven."""
2830,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2831,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The clock is on the stroke of twelve,"
2832,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And Johnny is not yet in sight,"
2833,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The moon's in heaven, as Betty sees,"
2834,THE IDIOT BOY.,But Betty is not quite at ease;
2835,THE IDIOT BOY.,And Susan has a dreadful night.
2836,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2837,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And Betty, half an hour ago,"
2838,THE IDIOT BOY.,On Johnny vile reflections cast:
2839,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""A little idle sauntering thing!"""
2840,THE IDIOT BOY.,"With other names, an endless string."
2841,THE IDIOT BOY.,But now that time is gone and past.
2842,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2843,THE IDIOT BOY.,And Betty's drooping at the heart.
2844,THE IDIOT BOY.,"That happy time all past and gone,"
2845,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""How can it be he is so late?"
2846,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The Doctor he has made him wait,"
2847,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Susan! they'll both be here anon."""
2848,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2849,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And Susan's growing worse and worse,"
2850,THE IDIOT BOY.,And Betty's in a sad quandary;
2851,THE IDIOT BOY.,And then there's nobody to say
2852,THE IDIOT BOY.,If she must go or she must stay:
2853,THE IDIOT BOY.,--She's in a sad quandary.
2854,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2855,THE IDIOT BOY.,The clock is on the stroke of one;
2856,THE IDIOT BOY.,But neither Doctor nor his guide
2857,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Appear along the moonlight road,"
2858,THE IDIOT BOY.,"There's neither horse nor man abroad,"
2859,THE IDIOT BOY.,And Betty's still at Susan's side.
2860,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2861,THE IDIOT BOY.,And Susan she begins to fear
2862,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Of sad mischances not a few,"
2863,THE IDIOT BOY.,"That Johnny may perhaps be drown'd,"
2864,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Or lost perhaps, and never found;"
2865,THE IDIOT BOY.,Which they must both for ever rue.
2866,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2867,THE IDIOT BOY.,She prefaced half a hint of this
2868,THE IDIOT BOY.,"With, ""God forbid it should be true!"""
2869,THE IDIOT BOY.,At the first word that Susan said
2870,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Cried Betty, rising from the bed,"
2871,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""Susan, I'd gladly stay with you."""
2872,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2873,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""I must be gone, I must away,"
2874,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Consider, Johnny's but half-wise;"
2875,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Susan, we must take care of him,"
2876,THE IDIOT BOY.,"If he is hurt in life or limb""--"
2877,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""Oh God forbid!"" poor Susan cries."
2878,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2879,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""What can I do?"" says Betty, going,"
2880,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""What can I do to ease your pain?"
2881,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Good Susan tell me, and I'll stay;"
2882,THE IDIOT BOY.,"I fear you're in a dreadful way,"
2883,THE IDIOT BOY.,"But I shall soon be back again."""
2884,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2885,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""Nay, Betty, go! good Betty, go!"
2886,THE IDIOT BOY.,"There's nothing that can ease my pain."""
2887,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Then off she hies, but with a prayer"
2888,THE IDIOT BOY.,"That God poor Susan's life would spare,"
2889,THE IDIOT BOY.,Till she comes back again.
2890,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2891,THE IDIOT BOY.,"So, through the moonlight lane she goes,"
2892,THE IDIOT BOY.,And far into the moonlight dale;
2893,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And how she ran, and how she walked,"
2894,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And all that to herself she talked,"
2895,THE IDIOT BOY.,Would surely be a tedious tale.
2896,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2897,THE IDIOT BOY.,"In high and low, above, below,"
2898,THE IDIOT BOY.,"In great and small, in round and square,"
2899,THE IDIOT BOY.,"In tree and tower was Johnny seen,"
2900,THE IDIOT BOY.,"In bush and brake, in black and green,"
2901,THE IDIOT BOY.,"'Twas Johnny, Johnny, every where."
2902,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2903,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She's past the bridge that's in the dale,"
2904,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And now the thought torments her sore,"
2905,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Johnny perhaps his horse forsook,"
2906,THE IDIOT BOY.,"To hunt the moon that's in the brook,"
2907,THE IDIOT BOY.,And never will be heard of more.
2908,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2909,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And now she's high upon the down,"
2910,THE IDIOT BOY.,Alone amid a prospect wide;
2911,THE IDIOT BOY.,"There's neither Johnny nor his horse,"
2912,THE IDIOT BOY.,Among the fern or in the gorse;
2913,THE IDIOT BOY.,There's neither doctor nor his guide.
2914,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2915,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""Oh saints! what is become of him?"
2916,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Perhaps he's climbed into an oak,"
2917,THE IDIOT BOY.,Where he will stay till he is dead;
2918,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Or sadly he has been misled,"
2919,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And joined the wandering gypsey-folk."""
2920,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2921,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""Or him that wicked pony's carried"
2922,THE IDIOT BOY.,"To the dark cave, the goblins' hall,"
2923,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Or in the castle he's pursuing,"
2924,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Among the ghosts, his own undoing;"
2925,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Or playing with the waterfall,"""
2926,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2927,THE IDIOT BOY.,"At poor old Susan then she railed,"
2928,THE IDIOT BOY.,While to the town she posts away;
2929,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""If Susan had not been so ill,"
2930,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Alas! I should have had him still,"
2931,THE IDIOT BOY.,"My Johnny, till my dying day."""
2932,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2933,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Poor Betty! in this sad distemper,"
2934,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The doctor's self would hardly spare,"
2935,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Unworthy things she talked and wild,"
2936,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Even he, of cattle the most mild,"
2937,THE IDIOT BOY.,The pony had his share.
2938,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2939,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And now she's got into the town,"
2940,THE IDIOT BOY.,And to the doctor's door she hies;
2941,THE IDIOT BOY.,'Tis silence all on every side;
2942,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The town so long, the town so wide,"
2943,THE IDIOT BOY.,Is silent as the skies.
2944,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2945,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And now she's at the doctor's door,"
2946,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She lifts the knocker, rap, rap, rap,"
2947,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The doctor at the casement shews,"
2948,THE IDIOT BOY.,His glimmering eyes that peep and doze;
2949,THE IDIOT BOY.,And one hand rubs his old night-cap.
2950,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2951,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""Oh Doctor! Doctor! where's my Johnny?"""
2952,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""I'm here, what is't you want with me?"""
2953,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""Oh Sir! you know I'm Betty Foy,"
2954,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And I have lost my poor dear boy,"
2955,THE IDIOT BOY.,"You know him--him you often see;"""
2956,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2957,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""He's not so wise as some folks be,"""
2958,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""The devil take his wisdom!"" said"
2959,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The Doctor, looking somewhat grim,"
2960,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""What, woman! should I know of him?"""
2961,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And, grumbling, he went back to bed."
2962,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2963,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""O woe is me! O woe is me!"
2964,THE IDIOT BOY.,Here will I die; here will I die;
2965,THE IDIOT BOY.,"I thought to find my Johnny here,"
2966,THE IDIOT BOY.,"But he is neither far nor near,"
2967,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Oh! what a wretched mother I!"""
2968,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2969,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She stops, she stands, she looks about,"
2970,THE IDIOT BOY.,Which way to turn she cannot tell.
2971,THE IDIOT BOY.,Poor Betty! it would ease her pain
2972,THE IDIOT BOY.,If she had heart to knock again;
2973,THE IDIOT BOY.,--The clock strikes three--a dismal knell!
2974,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2975,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Then up along the town she hies,"
2976,THE IDIOT BOY.,"No wonder if her senses fail,"
2977,THE IDIOT BOY.,"This piteous news so much it shock'd her,"
2978,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She quite forgot to send the Doctor,"
2979,THE IDIOT BOY.,To comfort poor old Susan Gale.
2980,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2981,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And now she's high upon the down,"
2982,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And she can see a mile of road,"
2983,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""Oh cruel! I'm almost three-score;"
2984,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Such night as this was ne'er before,"
2985,THE IDIOT BOY.,"There's not a single soul abroad."""
2986,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2987,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She listens, but she cannot hear"
2988,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The foot of horse, the voice of man;"
2989,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The streams with softest sound are flowing,"
2990,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The grass you almost hear it growing,"
2991,THE IDIOT BOY.,You hear it now if e'er you can.
2992,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2993,THE IDIOT BOY.,The owlets through the long blue night
2994,THE IDIOT BOY.,Are shouting to each other still:
2995,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Fond lovers, yet not quite hob nob,"
2996,THE IDIOT BOY.,"They lengthen out the tremulous sob,"
2997,THE IDIOT BOY.,That echoes far from hill to hill.
2998,THE IDIOT BOY.,
2999,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Poor Betty now has lost all hope,"
3000,THE IDIOT BOY.,Her thoughts are bent on deadly sin;
3001,THE IDIOT BOY.,"A green-grown pond she just has pass'd,"
3002,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And from the brink she hurries fast,"
3003,THE IDIOT BOY.,Lest she should drown herself therein.
3004,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3005,THE IDIOT BOY.,And now she sits her down and weeps;
3006,THE IDIOT BOY.,Such tears she never shed before;
3007,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""Oh dear, dear pony! my sweet joy!"
3008,THE IDIOT BOY.,Oh carry back my idiot boy!
3009,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And we will ne'er o'erload thee more."""
3010,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3011,THE IDIOT BOY.,A thought it come into her head;
3012,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""The pony he is mild and good,"
3013,THE IDIOT BOY.,And we have always used him well;
3014,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Perhaps he's gone along the dell,"
3015,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And carried Johnny to the wood."""
3016,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3017,THE IDIOT BOY.,Then up she springs as if on wings;
3018,THE IDIOT BOY.,She thinks no more of deadly sin;
3019,THE IDIOT BOY.,"If Betty fifty ponds should see,"
3020,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The last of all her thoughts would be,"
3021,THE IDIOT BOY.,To drown herself therein.
3022,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3023,THE IDIOT BOY.,Oh reader! now that I might tell
3024,THE IDIOT BOY.,What Johnny and his horse are doing!
3025,THE IDIOT BOY.,"What they've been doing all this time,"
3026,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Oh could I put it into rhyme,"
3027,THE IDIOT BOY.,A most delightful tale pursuing!
3028,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3029,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Perhaps, and no unlikely thought!"
3030,THE IDIOT BOY.,He with his pony now doth roam
3031,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The cliffs and peaks so high that are,"
3032,THE IDIOT BOY.,"To lay his hands upon a star,"
3033,THE IDIOT BOY.,And in his pocket bring it home.
3034,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3035,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Perhaps he's turned himself about,"
3036,THE IDIOT BOY.,"His face unto his horse's tail,"
3037,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And still and mute, in wonder lost,"
3038,THE IDIOT BOY.,"All like a silent horse-man ghost,"
3039,THE IDIOT BOY.,He travels on along the vale.
3040,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3041,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And now, perhaps, he's hunting sheep,"
3042,THE IDIOT BOY.,A fierce and dreadful hunter he!
3043,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Yon valley, that's so trim and green,"
3044,THE IDIOT BOY.,"In five months' time, should he be seen,"
3045,THE IDIOT BOY.,A desart wilderness will be.
3046,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3047,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Perhaps, with head and heels on fire,"
3048,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And like the very soul of evil,"
3049,THE IDIOT BOY.,"He's galloping away, away,"
3050,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And so he'll gallop on for aye,"
3051,THE IDIOT BOY.,The bane of all that dread the devil.
3052,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3053,THE IDIOT BOY.,I to the muses have been bound
3054,THE IDIOT BOY.,"These fourteen years, by strong indentures:"
3055,THE IDIOT BOY.,Oh gentle muses! let me tell
3056,THE IDIOT BOY.,"But half of what to him befel,"
3057,THE IDIOT BOY.,For sure he met with strange adventures.
3058,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3059,THE IDIOT BOY.,Oh gentle muses! is this kind
3060,THE IDIOT BOY.,Why will ye thus my suit repel?
3061,THE IDIOT BOY.,Why of your further aid bereave me?
3062,THE IDIOT BOY.,And can ye thus unfriended leave me?
3063,THE IDIOT BOY.,Ye muses! whom I love so well.
3064,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3065,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Who's yon, that, near the waterfall,"
3066,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Which thunders down with headlong force,"
3067,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Beneath the moon, yet shining fair,"
3068,THE IDIOT BOY.,"As careless as if nothing were,"
3069,THE IDIOT BOY.,Sits upright on a feeding horse?
3070,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3071,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Unto his horse, that's feeding free,"
3072,THE IDIOT BOY.,"He seems, I think, the rein to give;"
3073,THE IDIOT BOY.,Of moon or stars he takes no heed;
3074,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Of such we in romances read,"
3075,THE IDIOT BOY.,--Tis Johnny! Johnny! as I live.
3076,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3077,THE IDIOT BOY.,And that's the very pony too.
3078,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Where is she, where is Betty Foy?"
3079,THE IDIOT BOY.,She hardly can sustain her fears;
3080,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The roaring water-fall she hears,"
3081,THE IDIOT BOY.,And cannot find her idiot boy.
3082,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3083,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Your pony's worth his weight in gold,"
3084,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Then calm your terrors, Betty Foy!"
3085,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She's coming from among the trees,"
3086,THE IDIOT BOY.,And now all full in view she sees
3087,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Him whom she loves, her idiot boy."
3088,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3089,THE IDIOT BOY.,And Betty sees the pony too:
3090,THE IDIOT BOY.,Why stand you thus Good Betty Foy?
3091,THE IDIOT BOY.,"It is no goblin, 'tis no ghost,"
3092,THE IDIOT BOY.,"'Tis he whom you so long have lost,"
3093,THE IDIOT BOY.,"He whom you love, your idiot boy."
3094,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3095,THE IDIOT BOY.,She looks again-her arms are up--
3096,THE IDIOT BOY.,She screams--she cannot move for joy;
3097,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She darts as with a torrent's force,"
3098,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She almost has o'erturned the horse,"
3099,THE IDIOT BOY.,And fast she holds her idiot boy.
3100,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3101,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And Johnny burrs, and laughs aloud,"
3102,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Whether in cunning or in joy,"
3103,THE IDIOT BOY.,"I cannot tell; but while he laughs,"
3104,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Betty a drunken pleasure quaffs,"
3105,THE IDIOT BOY.,To hear again her idiot boy.
3106,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3107,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And now she's at the pony's tail,"
3108,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And now she's at the pony's head,"
3109,THE IDIOT BOY.,"On that side now, and now on this,"
3110,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And almost stifled with her bliss,"
3111,THE IDIOT BOY.,A few sad tears does Betty shed.
3112,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3113,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She kisses o'er and o'er again,"
3114,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Him whom she loves, her idiot boy,"
3115,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She's happy here, she's happy there."
3116,THE IDIOT BOY.,She is uneasy every where;
3117,THE IDIOT BOY.,Her limbs are all alive with joy.
3118,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3119,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She pats the pony, where or when"
3120,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She knows not, happy Betty Foy!"
3121,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The little pony glad may be,"
3122,THE IDIOT BOY.,"But he is milder far than she,"
3123,THE IDIOT BOY.,You hardly can perceive his joy.
3124,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3125,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""Oh! Johnny, never mind the Doctor;"
3126,THE IDIOT BOY.,"You've done your best, and that is all."""
3127,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She took the reins, when this was said,"
3128,THE IDIOT BOY.,And gently turned the pony's head
3129,THE IDIOT BOY.,From the loud water-fall.
3130,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3131,THE IDIOT BOY.,"By this the stars were almost gone,"
3132,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The moon was setting on the hill,"
3133,THE IDIOT BOY.,So pale you scarcely looked at her:
3134,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The little birds began to stir,"
3135,THE IDIOT BOY.,Though yet their tongues were still.
3136,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3137,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The pony, Betty, and her boy,"
3138,THE IDIOT BOY.,Wind slowly through the woody dale;
3139,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And who is she, be-times abroad,"
3140,THE IDIOT BOY.,That hobbles up the steep rough road?
3141,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Who is it, but old Susan Gale?"
3142,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3143,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Long Susan lay deep lost in thought,"
3144,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And many dreadful fears beset her,"
3145,THE IDIOT BOY.,Both for her messenger and nurse;
3146,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And as her mind grew worse and worse,"
3147,THE IDIOT BOY.,Her body it grew better.
3148,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3149,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She turned, she toss'd herself in bed,"
3150,THE IDIOT BOY.,On all sides doubts and terrors met her;
3151,THE IDIOT BOY.,Point after point did she discuss;
3152,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And while her mind was fighting thus,"
3153,THE IDIOT BOY.,Her body still grew better.
3154,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3155,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""Alas! what is become of them?"
3156,THE IDIOT BOY.,"These fears can never be endured,"
3157,THE IDIOT BOY.,"I'll to the wood.""--The word scarce said,"
3158,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Did Susan rise up from her bed,"
3159,THE IDIOT BOY.,As if by magic cured.
3160,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3161,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Away she posts up hill and down,"
3162,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And to the wood at length is come,"
3163,THE IDIOT BOY.,"She spies her friends, she shouts a greeting;"
3164,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Oh me! it is a merry meeting,"
3165,THE IDIOT BOY.,As ever was in Christendom.
3166,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3167,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The owls have hardly sung their last,"
3168,THE IDIOT BOY.,While our four travellers homeward wend;
3169,THE IDIOT BOY.,"The owls have hooted all night long,"
3170,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And with the owls began my song,"
3171,THE IDIOT BOY.,And with the owls must end.
3172,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3173,THE IDIOT BOY.,"For while they all were travelling home,"
3174,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Cried Betty, ""Tell us Johnny, do,"
3175,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Where all this long night you have been,"
3176,THE IDIOT BOY.,"What you have heard, what you have seen,"
3177,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And Johnny, mind you tell us true."""
3178,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3179,THE IDIOT BOY.,Now Johnny all night long had heard
3180,THE IDIOT BOY.,The owls in tuneful concert strive;
3181,THE IDIOT BOY.,No doubt too he the moon had seen;
3182,THE IDIOT BOY.,For in the moonlight he had been
3183,THE IDIOT BOY.,From eight o'clock till five.
3184,THE IDIOT BOY.,
3185,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And thus to Betty's question, he,"
3186,THE IDIOT BOY.,"Made answer, like a traveller bold,"
3187,THE IDIOT BOY.,"(His very words I give to you,)"
3188,THE IDIOT BOY.,"""The cocks did crow to-whoo, to-whoo,"
3189,THE IDIOT BOY.,"And the sun did shine so cold."""
3190,THE IDIOT BOY.,"--Thus answered Johnny in his glory,"
3191,THE IDIOT BOY.,And that was all his travel's story.

3211,_LOVE_.,My own dear Genevieve!
3212,_LOVE_.,
3213,_LOVE_.,"She lean'd against the Armed Man,"
3214,_LOVE_.,The Statue of the Armed Knight:
3215,_LOVE_.,She stood and listen'd to my Harp
3216,_LOVE_.,Amid the ling'ring Light.
3217,_LOVE_.,
3218,_LOVE_.,"Few Sorrows hath she of her own,"
3219,_LOVE_.,"My Hope, my Joy, my Genevieve!"
3220,_LOVE_.,"She loves me best, whene'er I sing"

3222,_LOVE_.,
3223,_LOVE_.,"I play'd a soft and doleful Air,"
3224,_LOVE_.,I sang an old and moving Story--
3225,_LOVE_.,An old rude Song that fitted well
3226,_LOVE_.,The Ruin wild and hoary.
3227,_LOVE_.,
3228,_LOVE_.,"She listen'd with a flitting Blush,"
3229,_LOVE_.,With downcast Eyes and modest Grace;
3230,_LOVE_.,"For well she knew, I could not choose"
3231,_LOVE_.,But gaze upon her Face.
3232,_LOVE_.,
3233,_LOVE_.,"I told her of the Knight, that wore"
3234,_LOVE_.,Upon his Shield a burning Brand;
3235,_LOVE_.,And that for ten long Years he woo'd
3236,_LOVE_.,_The Lady of the Land_.
3237,_LOVE_.,
3238,_LOVE_.,"I told her, how he pin'd: and, ah!"
3239,_LOVE_.,"The low, the deep, the pleading tone,"
3240,_LOVE_.,"With which I sang another's Love,"
3241,_LOVE_.,Interpreted my own.
3242,_LOVE_.,
3243,_LOVE_.,"She listen'd with a flitting Blush,"
3244,_LOVE_.,With downcast Eyes and modest Grace;

3246,_LOVE_.,Too fondly on her Face!
3247,_LOVE_.,
3248,_LOVE_.,But when I told the cruel scorn
3249,_LOVE_.,"Which craz'd this bold and lovely Knight,"
3250,_LOVE_.,And that be cross'd the mountain woods
3251,_LOVE_.,Nor rested day nor night;
3252,_LOVE_.,
3253,_LOVE_.,"That sometimes from the savage Den,"
3254,_LOVE_.,"And sometimes from the darksome Shade,"
3255,_LOVE_.,And sometimes starting up at once
3256,_LOVE_.,"In green and sunny Glade,"
3257,_LOVE_.,
3258,_LOVE_.,"There came, and look'd him in the face,"
3259,_LOVE_.,An Angel beautiful and bright;
3260,_LOVE_.,"And that he knew, it was a Fiend,"
3261,_LOVE_.,This miserable Knight!
3262,_LOVE_.,
3263,_LOVE_.,"And that, unknowing what he did,"
3264,_LOVE_.,"He leapt amid a murd'rous Band,"
3265,_LOVE_.,And sav'd from Outrage worse than Death
3266,_LOVE_.,The Lady of the Land;
3267,_LOVE_.,
3268,_LOVE_.,And how she wept and clasp'd his knees
3269,_LOVE_.,And how she tended him in vain--
3270,_LOVE_.,And ever strove to expiate
3271,_LOVE_.,"The Scorn, that craz'd his Brain"
3272,_LOVE_.,
3273,_LOVE_.,And that she nurs'd him in a Cave;
3274,_LOVE_.,And how his Madness went away
3275,_LOVE_.,When on the yellow forest leaves
3276,_LOVE_.,A dying Man he lay;
3277,_LOVE_.,
3278,_LOVE_.,His dying words--but when I reach'd
3279,_LOVE_.,"That tenderest strain of all the Ditty,"
3280,_LOVE_.,My falt'ring Voice and pausing Harp
3281,_LOVE_.,Disturb'd her Soul with Pity!
3282,_LOVE_.,
3283,_LOVE_.,All Impulses of Soul and Sense
3284,_LOVE_.,"Had thrill'd my guileless Genevieve,"

3290,_LOVE_.,"And gentle Wishes long subdued,"
3291,_LOVE_.,Subdued and cherish'd long!
3292,_LOVE_.,
3293,_LOVE_.,"She wept with pity and delight,"
3294,_LOVE_.,She blush'd with love and maiden shame;
3295,_LOVE_.,"And, like the murmur of a dream,"
3296,_LOVE_.,I heard her breathe my name.
3297,_LOVE_.,
3298,_LOVE_.,Her Bosom heav'd--she stepp'd aside;
3299,_LOVE_.,"As conscious of my Look, she stepp'd--"
3300,_LOVE_.,Then suddenly with timorous eye
3301,_LOVE_.,She fled to me and wept.
3302,_LOVE_.,
3303,_LOVE_.,"She half inclosed me with her arms,"
3304,_LOVE_.,She press'd me with a meek embrace;
3305,_LOVE_.,"And bending back her head look'd up,"
3306,_LOVE_.,And gaz'd upon my face.
3307,_LOVE_.,
3308,_LOVE_.,"'Twas partly Love, and partly Fear,"
3309,_LOVE_.,And partly 'twas a bashful Art
3310,_LOVE_.,That I might rather feel than see
3311,_LOVE_.,The Swelling of her Heart.
3312,_LOVE_.,
3313,_LOVE_.,"I calm'd her Tears; and she was calm,"
3314,_LOVE_.,And told her love with virgin Pride.
3315,_LOVE_.,"And so I won my Genevieve,"
3316,_LOVE_.,My bright and beauteous Bride!
3317,_LOVE_.,
3318,_LOVE_.,
3319,_LOVE_.,
3320,_LOVE_.,
3321,_LOVE_.,_The MAD MOTHER_.
3322,_LOVE_.,
3323,_LOVE_.,"Her eyes are wild, her head is bare,"
3324,_LOVE_.,"The sun has burnt her coal-black hair,"
3325,_LOVE_.,"Her eye-brows have a rusty stain,"
3326,_LOVE_.,And she came far from over the main.
3327,_LOVE_.,"She has a baby on her arm,"
3328,_LOVE_.,Or else she were alone;
3329,_LOVE_.,"And underneath the hay-stack warm,"
3330,_LOVE_.,"And on the green-wood stone,"
3331,_LOVE_.,She talked and sung the woods among;
3332,_LOVE_.,And it was in the English tongue.
3333,_LOVE_.,
3334,_LOVE_.,"""Sweet babe! they say that I am mad,"
3335,_LOVE_.,"But nay, my heart is far too glad;"
3336,_LOVE_.,And I am happy when I sing
3337,_LOVE_.,Full many a sad and doleful thing:
3338,_LOVE_.,"Then, lovely baby, do not fear!"
3339,_LOVE_.,"I pray thee have no fear of me,"
3340,_LOVE_.,"But, safe as in a cradle, here"
3341,_LOVE_.,"My lovely baby! thou shalt be,"
3342,_LOVE_.,To thee I know too much I owe;
3343,_LOVE_.,"I cannot work thee any woe."""
3344,_LOVE_.,
3345,_LOVE_.,A fire was once within my brain;
3346,_LOVE_.,"And in my head a dull, dull pain;"
3347,_LOVE_.,"And fiendish faces one, two, three,"
3348,_LOVE_.,"Hung at my breasts, and pulled at me."
3349,_LOVE_.,But then there came a sight of joy;
3350,_LOVE_.,It came at once to do me good;
3351,_LOVE_.,"I waked, and saw my little boy,"
3352,_LOVE_.,My little boy of flesh and blood;
3353,_LOVE_.,Oh joy for me that sight to see!
3354,_LOVE_.,"For he was here, and only he."
3355,_LOVE_.,
3356,_LOVE_.,"Suck, little babe, oh suck again!"
3357,_LOVE_.,It cools my blood; it cools my brain;
3358,_LOVE_.,"Thy lips I feel them, baby! they"
3359,_LOVE_.,Draw from my heart the pain away.
3360,_LOVE_.,Oh! press me with thy little hand;
3361,_LOVE_.,It loosens something at my chest;
3362,_LOVE_.,About that tight and deadly band
3363,_LOVE_.,I feel thy little fingers press'd.
3364,_LOVE_.,The breeze I see is in the tree;
3365,_LOVE_.,It comes to cool my babe and me.
3366,_LOVE_.,
3367,_LOVE_.,"Oh! love me, love me, little boy!"
3368,_LOVE_.,Thou art thy mother's only joy;
3369,_LOVE_.,"And do not dread the waves below,"
3370,_LOVE_.,When o'er the sea-rock's edge we go;
3371,_LOVE_.,"The high crag cannot work me harm,"
3372,_LOVE_.,Nor leaping torrents when they howl;
3373,_LOVE_.,"The babe I carry on my arm,"
3374,_LOVE_.,He saves for me my precious soul;
3375,_LOVE_.,"Then happy lie, for blest am I;"
3376,_LOVE_.,Without me my sweet babe would die.
3377,_LOVE_.,
3378,_LOVE_.,"Then do not fear, my boy! for thee"
3379,_LOVE_.,Bold as a lion I will be;
3380,_LOVE_.,"And I will always be thy guide,"
3381,_LOVE_.,Through hollow snows and rivers wide.
3382,_LOVE_.,I'll build an Indian bower; I know
3383,_LOVE_.,The leaves that make the softest bed:
3384,_LOVE_.,And if from me thou wilt not go.
3385,_LOVE_.,"But still be true 'till I am dead,"
3386,_LOVE_.,"My pretty thing! then thou shalt sing,"
3387,_LOVE_.,As merry as the birds in spring.
3388,_LOVE_.,
3389,_LOVE_.,"Thy father cares not for my breast,"
3390,_LOVE_.,"'Tis thine, sweet baby, there to rest:"
3391,_LOVE_.,'Tis all thine own! and if its hue
3392,_LOVE_.,"Be changed, that was so fair to view,"
3393,_LOVE_.,"'Tis fair enough for thee, my dove!"
3394,_LOVE_.,"My beauty, little child, is flown;"
3395,_LOVE_.,"But thou will live with me in love,"
3396,_LOVE_.,And what if my poor cheek be brown?
3397,_LOVE_.,"'Tis well for me, thou canst not see"
3398,_LOVE_.,How pale and wan it else would be.
3399,_LOVE_.,
3400,_LOVE_.,"Dread not their taunts, my little life!"
3401,_LOVE_.,I am thy father's wedded wife;
3402,_LOVE_.,And underneath the spreading tree
3403,_LOVE_.,We two will live in honesty.
3404,_LOVE_.,"If his sweet boy he could forsake,"
3405,_LOVE_.,With me he never would have stay'd:
3406,_LOVE_.,"From him no harm my babe can take,"
3407,_LOVE_.,"But he, poor man! is wretched made,"
3408,_LOVE_.,And every day we two will pray
3409,_LOVE_.,For him that's gone and far away.
3410,_LOVE_.,
3411,_LOVE_.,I'll teach my boy the sweetest things;
3412,_LOVE_.,I'll teach him how the owlet sings.
3413,_LOVE_.,"My little babe! thy lips are still,"
3414,_LOVE_.,And thou hast almost suck'd thy fill.
3415,_LOVE_.,--Where art thou gone my own dear child?
3416,_LOVE_.,What wicked looks are those I see?
3417,_LOVE_.,"Alas! alas! that look so wild,"
3418,_LOVE_.,"It never, never came from me:"
3419,_LOVE_.,"If thou art mad, my pretty lad,"
3420,_LOVE_.,Then I must be for ever sad.
3421,_LOVE_.,
3422,_LOVE_.,"Oh! smile on me, my little lamb!"
3423,_LOVE_.,For I thy own dear mother am.
3424,_LOVE_.,My love for thee has well been tried:
3425,_LOVE_.,I've sought thy father far and wide.
3426,_LOVE_.,"I know the poisons of the shade,"
3427,_LOVE_.,I know the earth-nuts fit for food;
3428,_LOVE_.,"Then, pretty dear, be not afraid;"
3429,_LOVE_.,We'll find thy father in the wood.
3430,_LOVE_.,"Now laugh and be gay, to the woods away!"

3673,III.,When that strange shape drove suddenly
3674,III.,Betwixt us and the Sun.
3675,III.,
3676,III.,And strait the Sun was fleck'd with bars
3677,III.,(Heaven's mother send us grace)
3678,III.,As if thro' a dungeon grate he peer'd
3679,III.,With broad and burning face.
3680,III.,
3681,III.,"Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)"
3682,III.,How fast she nears and nears!
3683,III.,Are those _her_ Sails that glance in the Sun
3684,III.,Like restless gossameres?
3685,III.,
3686,III.,"Are those _her_ Ribs, thro' which the Sun"
3687,III.,"Did peer, as thro' a grate?"
3688,III.,"And are those two all, all her crew."
3689,III.,"That Woman, and her Mate?"
3690,III.,
3691,III.,"_His_ bones were black with many a crack,"
3692,III.,"All black and bare, I ween;"
3693,III.,"Jet-black and bare, save where with rust"
3694,III.,Of mouldy damps and charnel crust
3695,III.,They were patch'd with purple and green.
3696,III.,
3697,III.,"_Her_ lips were red, _her_ looks were free,"
3698,III.,_Her_ locks were yellow as gold:
3699,III.,"Her skin was as white as leprosy,"
3700,III.,And she was far liker Death than he;
3701,III.,Her flesh made the still air cold.
3702,III.,
3703,III.,The naked Hulk alongside came
3704,III.,And the Twain were playing dice;
3705,III.,"""The Game is done! I've won, I've won!"""
3706,III.,"Quoth she, and whistled thrice."
3707,III.,
3708,III.,A gust of wind sterte up behind
3709,III.,And whistled thro' his bones;
3710,III.,Thro' the holes of his eyes and the hole of his mouth
3711,III.,Half-whistles and half-groans.
3712,III.,
3713,III.,With never a whisper in the Sea
3714,III.,Off darts the Spectre-ship;
3715,III.,While clombe above the Eastern bar
3716,III.,"The horned Moon, with one bright Star"
3717,III.,Almost between the tips.
3718,III.,
3719,III.,One after one by the horned Moon
3720,III.,"(Listen, O Stranger! to me)"
3721,III.,Each turn'd his face with a ghastly pang
3722,III.,And curs'd me with his ee.
3723,III.,
3724,III.,"Four times fifty living men,"
3725,III.,"With never a sigh or groan,"
3726,III.,"With heavy thump, a lifeless lump"
3727,III.,They dropp'd down one by one.
3728,III.,
3729,III.,"Their souls did from their bodies fly,--"
3730,III.,They fled to bliss or woe;
3731,III.,"And every soul it pass'd me by,"
3732,III.,"Like, the whiz of my Cross-bow."
3733,III.,
3734,III.,
3735,IV.,IV.
3736,IV.,
3737,IV.,"""I fear thee, ancient Mariner!"
3738,IV.,I fear thy skinny hand;
3739,IV.,And thou art long and lank and brown
3740,IV.,"As is the ribb'd Sea-sand."""
3741,IV.,
3742,IV.,"""I fear thee and thy glittering eye"
3743,IV.,"And thy skinny hand so brown--"""
3744,IV.,"""Fear not, fear not, thou wedding guest!"
3745,IV.,"This body dropt not down."""
3746,IV.,
3747,IV.,"Alone, alone, all all alone"
3748,IV.,Alone on the wide wide Sea;
3749,IV.,And Christ would take no pity on
3750,IV.,My soul in agony.
3751,IV.,
3752,IV.,"The many men so beautiful,"
3753,IV.,And they all dead did lie!
3754,IV.,And a million million slimy things
3755,IV.,Liv'd on--and so did I.
3756,IV.,
3757,IV.,"I look'd upon the rotting Sea,"
3758,IV.,And drew my eyes away;
3759,IV.,"I look'd upon the ghastly deck,"
3760,IV.,And there the dead men lay.
3761,IV.,
3762,IV.,"I look'd to Heaven, and try'd to pray;"
3763,IV.,"But or ever a prayer had gusht,"
3764,IV.,A wicked whisper came and made
3765,IV.,My heart as dry as dust.
3766,IV.,
3767,IV.,"I clos'd my lids and kept them close,"
3768,IV.,Till the balls like pulses beat;
3769,IV.,"For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky"
3770,IV.,"Lay like a load on my weary eye,"
3771,IV.,And the dead were at my feet.
3772,IV.,
3773,IV.,"The cold sweat melted from their limbs,"
3774,IV.,"Nor rot, nor reek did they;"
3775,IV.,"The look with which they look'd on me,"
3776,IV.,Had never pass'd away.
3777,IV.,
3778,IV.,An orphan's curse would drag to Hell
3779,IV.,A spirit from on high:
3780,IV.,But O! more horrible than that
3781,IV.,Is the curse in a dead man's eye!
3782,IV.,"Seven days, seven nights I saw that curse,"
3783,IV.,And yet I could not die.
3784,IV.,
3785,IV.,The moving Moon went up the sky
3786,IV.,And no where did abide:
3787,IV.,Softly she was going up
3788,IV.,And a star or two beside--
3789,IV.,
3790,IV.,Her beams bemock'd the sultry main
3791,IV.,Like April hoar-frost spread;
3792,IV.,"But where the ship's huge shadow lay,"
3793,IV.,The charmed water burnt alway
3794,IV.,A still and awful red.
3795,IV.,
3796,IV.,Beyond the shadow of the ship
3797,IV.,I watch'd the water-snakes:
3798,IV.,They mov'd in tracks of shining white;
3799,IV.,"And when they rear'd, the elfish light"
3800,IV.,Fell off in hoary flakes.
3801,IV.,
3802,IV.,Within the shadow of the ship
3803,IV.,I watch'd their rich attire:
3804,IV.,"Blue, glossy green, and velvet black"
3805,IV.,They coil'd and swam; and every track
3806,IV.,Was a flash of golden fire.
3807,IV.,
3808,IV.,O happy living things! no tongue
3809,IV.,Their beauty might declare:
3810,IV.,"A spring of love gusht from my heart,"
3811,IV.,And I bless'd them unaware!
3812,IV.,"Sure my kind saint took pity on me,"
3813,IV.,And I bless'd them unaware.
3814,IV.,
3815,IV.,The self-same moment I could pray;
3816,IV.,And from my neck so free
3817,IV.,"The Albatross fell off, and sank"
3818,IV.,Like lead into the sea.
3819,IV.,
3820,IV.,
3821,V.,V.
3822,V.,
3823,V.,"O sleep, it is a gentle thing"
3824,V.,Belov'd from pole to pole!
3825,V.,To Mary-queen the praise be given
3826,V.,She sent the gentle sleep from heaven
3827,V.,That slid into my soul.
3828,V.,
3829,V.,The silly buckets on the deck
3830,V.,"That had so long remain'd,"
3831,V.,I dreamt that they were fill'd with dew
3832,V.,And when I awoke it rain'd.
3833,V.,
3834,V.,"My lips were wet, my throat was cold,"
3835,V.,My garments all were dank;
3836,V.,Sure I had drunken in my dreams
3837,V.,And still my body drank.
3838,V.,
3839,V.,"I mov'd and could not feel my limbs,"
3840,V.,"I was so light, almost"
3841,V.,"I thought that I had died in sleep,"
3842,V.,And was a blessed Ghost.
3843,V.,
3844,V.,"And soon I heard a roaring wind,"
3845,V.,It did not come anear;
3846,V.,But with its sound it shook the sails
3847,V.,That were so thin and sere.
3848,V.,
3849,V.,The upper air burst into life
3850,V.,And a hundred fire-flags sheen
3851,V.,To and fro they were hurried about;
3852,V.,"And to and fro, and in and out"
3853,V.,The wan stars danc'd between.
3854,V.,
3855,V.,And the coming wind did roar more loud;
3856,V.,And the sails did sigh like sedge:
3857,V.,And the rain pour'd down from one black cloud
3858,V.,The moon was at its edge.
3859,V.,
3860,V.,"The thick black cloud was cleft, and still"
3861,V.,The Moon was at its side:
3862,V.,"Like waters shot from some high crag,"
3863,V.,"The lightning fell, with never a jag"
3864,V.,A river steep and wide.
3865,V.,
3866,V.,"The loud wind never reach'd the Ship,"
3867,V.,Yet now the Ship mov'd on!
3868,V.,Beneath the lightning and the moon
3869,V.,The dead men gave a groan.
3870,V.,
3871,V.,"They groan'd; they stirr'd, they all uprose,"
3872,V.,"Nor spake, nor mov'd their eyes:"
3873,V.,"It had been strange, even in a dream"
3874,V.,"To have seen those dead men rise,"
3875,V.,
3876,V.,"The helmsman steerd, the ship mov'd on;"
3877,V.,Yet never a breeze up-blew;
3878,V.,"The Mariners all gan work the ropes,"
3879,V.,Where they were wont to do:
3880,V.,They rais'd their limbs like lifeless tools--
3881,V.,We were a ghastly crew.
3882,V.,
3883,V.,The body of my brother's son
3884,V.,Stood by me knee to knee:
3885,V.,"The body and I pull'd at one rope,"
3886,V.,But he said nought to me.
3887,V.,
3888,V.,"""I fear thee, ancient Mariner!"""
3889,V.,"""Be calm, thou wedding guest!"
3890,V.,"'Twas not those souls, that fled in pain,"
3891,V.,"Which to their corses came again,"
3892,V.,"But a troop of Spirits blest:"""
3893,V.,
3894,V.,"""For when it dawn'd--they dropp'd their arms,"
3895,V.,And cluster'd round the mast:
3896,V.,Sweet sounds rose slowly thro' their mouths
3897,V.,"And from their bodies pass'd."""
3898,V.,
3899,V.,"Around, around, flew each sweet sound,"
3900,V.,Then darted to the sun:
3901,V.,Slowly the sounds came back again
3902,V.,"Now mix'd, now one by one."
3903,V.,
3904,V.,Sometimes a dropping from the sky
3905,V.,I heard the Sky-lark sing;
3906,V.,Sometimes all little birds that are
3907,V.,How they seem'd to fill the sea and air
3908,V.,With their sweet jargoning.
3909,V.,
3910,V.,"And now 'twas like all instruments,"
3911,V.,Now like a lonely flute;
3912,V.,And now it is an angel's song
3913,V.,That makes the heavens be mute.
3914,V.,
3915,V.,It ceas'd: yet still the sails made on
3916,V.,"A pleasant noise till noon,"
3917,V.,A noise like of a hidden brook
3918,V.,"In the leafy month of June,"
3919,V.,"That to the sleeping woods all night,"
3920,V.,Singeth a quiet tune.
3921,V.,
3922,V.,Till noon we silently sail'd on
3923,V.,Yet never a breeze did breathe:
3924,V.,Slowly and smoothly went the Ship
3925,V.,Mov'd onward from beneath.
3926,V.,
3927,V.,Under the keel nine fathom deep
3928,V.,From the land of mist and snow
3929,V.,The spirit slid: and it was He
3930,V.,That made the Ship to go.
3931,V.,The sails at noon left off their tune
3932,V.,And the Ship stood still also.
3933,V.,
3934,V.,The sun right up above the mast
3935,V.,Had fix'd her to the ocean:
3936,V.,But in a minute she 'gan stir
3937,V.,With a short uneasy motion--
3938,V.,Backwards and forwards half her length
3939,V.,With a short uneasy motion.
3940,V.,
3941,V.,"Then, like a pawing horse let go,"
3942,V.,She made a sudden bound:
3943,V.,"It flung the blood into my head,"
3944,V.,And I fell into a swound.
3945,V.,
3946,V.,"How long in that same fit I lay,"
3947,V.,I have not to declare;
3948,V.,"But ere my living life return'd,"
3949,V.,I heard and in my soul discern'd
3950,V.,Two voices in the air.
3951,V.,
3952,V.,"""Is it he?"" quoth one, ""Is this the man?"
3953,V.,"By him who died on cross,"
3954,V.,With his cruel bow he lay'd full low
3955,V.,"The harmless Albatross."""
3956,V.,
3957,V.,"""The spirit who 'bideth by himself"
3958,V.,"In the land of mist and snow,"
3959,V.,He lov'd the bird that lov'd the man
3960,V.,"Who shot him with his bow."""
3961,V.,
3962,V.,"The other was a softer voice,"
3963,V.,As soft as honey-dew:
3964,V.,"Quoth he the man hath penance done,"
3965,V.,And penance more will do.
3966,V.,
3967,V.,
3968,VI.,VI.
3969,VI.,
3970,FIRST VOICE.,FIRST VOICE.
3971,FIRST VOICE.,
3972,FIRST VOICE.,"""But tell me, tell me! speak again,"
3973,FIRST VOICE.,Thy soft response renewing--
3974,FIRST VOICE.,What makes that ship drive on so fast?
3975,FIRST VOICE.,"What is the Ocean doing?"""
3976,FIRST VOICE.,
3977,SECOND VOICE.,SECOND VOICE.
3978,SECOND VOICE.,
3979,SECOND VOICE.,"""Still as a Slave before his Lord,"
3980,SECOND VOICE.,The Ocean hath no blast:
3981,SECOND VOICE.,His great bright eye most silently
3982,SECOND VOICE.,"Up to the moon is cast--"""
3983,SECOND VOICE.,
3984,SECOND VOICE.,"""If he may know which way to go,"
3985,SECOND VOICE.,"For she guides him smooth or grim,"
3986,SECOND VOICE.,"See, brother, see! how graciously"
3987,SECOND VOICE.,"She looketh down on him."""
3988,SECOND VOICE.,
3989,FIRST VOICE.,FIRST VOICE.
3990,FIRST VOICE.,
3991,FIRST VOICE.,"""But why drives on that ship so fast"
3992,FIRST VOICE.,"Without or wave or wind?"""
3993,FIRST VOICE.,
3994,SECOND VOICE.,SECOND VOICE.
3995,SECOND VOICE.,
3996,SECOND VOICE.,"""The air is cut away before,"
3997,SECOND VOICE.,"And closes from behind."""
3998,SECOND VOICE.,
3999,SECOND VOICE.,"""Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high,"
4000,SECOND VOICE.,Or we shall be belated:
4001,SECOND VOICE.,"For slow and slow that ship will go,"
4002,SECOND VOICE.,"When the Mariner's trance is abated."""
4003,SECOND VOICE.,
4004,SECOND VOICE.,"I woke, and we were sailing on"
4005,SECOND VOICE.,As in a gentle weather:
4006,SECOND VOICE.,"'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;"
4007,SECOND VOICE.,The dead men stood together.
4008,SECOND VOICE.,
4009,SECOND VOICE.,"All stood together on the deck,"
4010,SECOND VOICE.,For a charnel-dungeon fitter:
4011,SECOND VOICE.,All fix'd on me their stony eyes
4012,SECOND VOICE.,That in the moon did glitter.
4013,SECOND VOICE.,
4014,SECOND VOICE.,"The pang, the curse, with which they died,"
4015,SECOND VOICE.,Had never pass'd away;
4016,SECOND VOICE.,I could not draw my eyes from theirs
4017,SECOND VOICE.,Nor turn them up to pray.
4018,SECOND VOICE.,
4019,SECOND VOICE.,And now this spell was snapt: once more
4020,SECOND VOICE.,"I view'd the ocean green,"
4021,SECOND VOICE.,"And look'd far forth, yet little saw"
4022,SECOND VOICE.,Of what had else been seen.
4023,SECOND VOICE.,
4024,SECOND VOICE.,"Like one, that on a lonesome road"
4025,SECOND VOICE.,"Doth walk in fear and dread,"
4026,SECOND VOICE.,"And having once turn'd round, walks on"
4027,SECOND VOICE.,And turns no more his head:
4028,SECOND VOICE.,"Because he knows, a frightful fiend"
4029,SECOND VOICE.,Doth close behind him tread.
4030,SECOND VOICE.,
4031,SECOND VOICE.,"But soon there breath'd a wind on me,"
4032,SECOND VOICE.,Nor sound nor motion made:
4033,SECOND VOICE.,Its path was not upon the sea
4034,SECOND VOICE.,In ripple or in shade.
4035,SECOND VOICE.,
4036,SECOND VOICE.,"It rais'd my hair, it fann'd my cheek,"
4037,SECOND VOICE.,Like a meadow-gale of spring--
4038,SECOND VOICE.,"It mingled strangely with my fears,"
4039,SECOND VOICE.,Yet it felt like a welcoming.
4040,SECOND VOICE.,
4041,SECOND VOICE.,"Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship"
4042,SECOND VOICE.,Yet she sail'd softly too:
4043,SECOND VOICE.,"Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--"
4044,SECOND VOICE.,On me alone it blew.
4045,SECOND VOICE.,
4046,SECOND VOICE.,O dream of joy! is this indeed
4047,SECOND VOICE.,The light-house top I see?
4048,SECOND VOICE.,Is this the Hill? Is this the Kirk?
4049,SECOND VOICE.,Is this mine own countrée?
4050,SECOND VOICE.,
4051,SECOND VOICE.,"We drifted o'er the Harbour-bar,"
4052,SECOND VOICE.,And I with sobs did pray--
4053,SECOND VOICE.,"""O let me be awake, my God!"
4054,SECOND VOICE.,"Or let me sleep alway!"""
4055,SECOND VOICE.,
4056,SECOND VOICE.,"The harbour-bay was clear as glass,"
4057,SECOND VOICE.,So smoothly it was strewn!
4058,SECOND VOICE.,"And on the bay the moonlight lay,"
4059,SECOND VOICE.,And the shadow of the moon.
4060,SECOND VOICE.,
4061,SECOND VOICE.,"The rock shone bright, the kirk no less:"
4062,SECOND VOICE.,That stands above the rock:
4063,SECOND VOICE.,The moonlight steep'd in silentness
4064,SECOND VOICE.,The steady weathercock.
4065,SECOND VOICE.,
4066,SECOND VOICE.,"And the bay was white with silent light,"
4067,SECOND VOICE.,Till rising from the same
4068,SECOND VOICE.,"Full many shapes, that shadows were,"
4069,SECOND VOICE.,In crimson colours came.
4070,SECOND VOICE.,
4071,SECOND VOICE.,A little distance from the prow
4072,SECOND VOICE.,Those crimson shadows were:
4073,SECOND VOICE.,I turn'd my eyes upon the deck--
4074,SECOND VOICE.,O Christ! what saw I there?
4075,SECOND VOICE.,
4076,SECOND VOICE.,"Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat;"
4077,SECOND VOICE.,And by the Holy rood
4078,SECOND VOICE.,"A man all light, a seraph-man,"
4079,SECOND VOICE.,On every corse there stood.
4080,SECOND VOICE.,
4081,SECOND VOICE.,"This seraph-band, each wav'd his hand:"
4082,SECOND VOICE.,It was a heavenly sight:
4083,SECOND VOICE.,"They stood as signals to the land,"
4084,SECOND VOICE.,Each one a lovely light:
4085,SECOND VOICE.,
4086,SECOND VOICE.,"This seraph-band, each wav'd his hand,"
4087,SECOND VOICE.,No voice did they impart--
4088,SECOND VOICE.,"No voice; but O! the silence sank,"
4089,SECOND VOICE.,Like music on my heart.
4090,SECOND VOICE.,
4091,SECOND VOICE.,"But soon I heard the dash of oars,"
4092,SECOND VOICE.,I heard the pilot's cheer:
4093,SECOND VOICE.,My head was turn'd perforce away
4094,SECOND VOICE.,And I saw a boat appear.
4095,SECOND VOICE.,
4096,SECOND VOICE.,"The pilot, and the pilot's boy"
4097,SECOND VOICE.,I heard them coming fast:
4098,SECOND VOICE.,"Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy,"
4099,SECOND VOICE.,The dead men could not blast.
4100,SECOND VOICE.,
4101,SECOND VOICE.,I saw a third--I heard his voice:
4102,SECOND VOICE.,It is the Hermit good!
4103,SECOND VOICE.,He singeth loud his godly hymns
4104,SECOND VOICE.,That he makes in the wood.
4105,SECOND VOICE.,"He'll shrive my soul, he'll wash away"
4106,SECOND VOICE.,The Albatross's blood.
4107,SECOND VOICE.,
4108,SECOND VOICE.,
4109,VII.,VII.
4110,VII.,
4111,VII.,This Hermit good lives in that wood
4112,VII.,Which slopes down to the Sea.
4113,VII.,How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
4114,VII.,He loves to talk with Mariners
4115,VII.,That come from a far countrée.
4116,VII.,
4117,VII.,He kneels at morn and noon and eve--
4118,VII.,He hath a cushion plump:
4119,VII.,"It is the moss, that wholly hides"
4120,VII.,The rotted old Oak-stump.
4121,VII.,
4122,VII.,"The Skiff-boat ner'd: I heard them talk,"
4123,VII.,"""Why, this is strange, I trow!"
4124,VII.,Where are those lights so many and fair
4125,VII.,"That signal made but now?"""
4126,VII.,
4127,VII.,"""Strange, by my faith!"" the Hermit said--"
4128,VII.,"""And they answer'd not our cheer."
4129,VII.,"The planks look warp'd, and see those sails"
4130,VII.,How thin they are and sere!
4131,VII.,I never saw aught like to them
4132,VII.,"Unless perchance it were"""
4133,VII.,
4134,VII.,"""The skeletons of leaves that lag"
4135,VII.,My forest brook along:
4136,VII.,"When the Ivy-tod is heavy with snow,"
4137,VII.,And the Owlet whoops to the wolf below
4138,VII.,"That eats the she-wolf's young."""
4139,VII.,
4140,VII.,"""Dear Lord! it has a fiendish look--"""
4141,VII.,(The Pilot made reply)
4142,VII.,"""I am a-fear'd.""--""Push on, push on!"""
4143,VII.,"""Said the Hermit cheerily."""
4144,VII.,
4145,VII.,"The Boat came closer to the Ship,"
4146,VII.,But I nor spake nor stirr'd!
4147,VII.,"The Boat came close beneath the Ship,"
4148,VII.,And strait a sound was heard!
4149,VII.,
4150,VII.,"Under the water it rumbled on,"
4151,VII.,Still louder and more dread:
4152,VII.,"It reach'd the Ship, it split the bay;"
4153,VII.,The Ship went down like lead.
4154,VII.,
4155,VII.,"Stunn'd by that loud and dreadful sound,"
4156,VII.,Which sky and ocean smote:
4157,VII.,Like one that hath been seven days drown'd
4158,VII.,My body lay afloat:
4159,VII.,"But, swift as dreams, myself I found"
4160,VII.,Within the Pilot's boat.
4161,VII.,
4162,VII.,"Upon the whirl, where sank the Ship,"
4163,VII.,The boat spun round and round:
4164,VII.,"And all was still, save that the hill"
4165,VII.,Was telling of the sound.
4166,VII.,
4167,VII.,I mov'd my lips: the Pilot shriek'd
4168,VII.,And fell down in a fit.
4169,VII.,The Holy Hermit rais'd his eyes
4170,VII.,And pray'd where he did sit.
4171,VII.,
4172,VII.,"I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,"
4173,VII.,"Who now doth crazy go,"
4174,VII.,"Laugh'd loud and long, and all the while"
4175,VII.,"His eyes went to and fro,"
4176,VII.,"""Ha! ha!"" quoth he--""full plain I see,"
4177,VII.,"The devil knows how to row."""
4178,VII.,
4179,VII.,And now all in mine own Countrée
4180,VII.,I stood on the firm land!
4181,VII.,"The Hermit stepp'd forth from the boat,"
4182,VII.,And scarcely he could stand.
4183,VII.,
4184,VII.,"""O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy Man!"""
4185,VII.,The Hermit cross'd his brow--
4186,VII.,"""Say quick,"" quoth he, ""I bid thee say"
4187,VII.,"What manner man art thou?"""
4188,VII.,
4189,VII.,Forthwith this frame of mind was wrench'd
4190,VII.,"With a woeful agony,"
4191,VII.,Which forc'd me to begin my tale
4192,VII.,And then it left me free.
4193,VII.,
4194,VII.,"Since then at an uncertain hour,"
4195,VII.,That agency returns;
4196,VII.,And till my ghastly tale is told
4197,VII.,This heart within me burns.
4198,VII.,
4199,VII.,"I pass, like night, from land to land;"
4200,VII.,I have strange power of speech;
4201,VII.,The moment that his face I see
4202,VII.,I know the man that must hear me;
4203,VII.,To him my tale I teach.
4204,VII.,
4205,VII.,What loud uproar bursts from that door!
4206,VII.,The Wedding-guests are there;
4207,VII.,But in the Garden-bower the Bride
4208,VII.,And Bride-maids singing are:
4209,VII.,And hark the little Vesper-bell
4210,VII.,Which biddeth me to prayer.
4211,VII.,
4212,VII.,O Wedding-guest! this soul hath been
4213,VII.,Alone on a wide wide sea:
4214,VII.,"So lonely 'twas, that God himself"
4215,VII.,Scarce seemed there to be.
4216,VII.,
4217,VII.,"O sweeter than the Marriage-feast,"
4218,VII.,'Tis sweeter far to me
4219,VII.,To walk together to the Kirk
4220,VII.,With a goodly company.
4221,VII.,
4222,VII.,To walk together to the Kirk
4223,VII.,"And all together pray,"
4224,VII.,"While each to his great father bends,"
4225,VII.,"Old men, and babes, and loving friends,"
4226,VII.,"And Youths, and Maidens gay."
4227,VII.,
4228,VII.,"Farewell, farewell! but this I tell"
4229,VII.,"To thee, thou wedding-guest!"
4230,VII.,He prayeth well who loveth well
4231,VII.,"Both man, and bird and beast."
4232,VII.,
4233,VII.,He prayeth best who loveth best
4234,VII.,All things both great and small:
4235,VII.,"For the dear God, who loveth us,"
4236,VII.,He made and loveth all.
4237,VII.,
4238,VII.,"The Mariner, whose eye is bright,"
4239,VII.,"Whose beard with age is hoar,"
4240,VII.,Is gone; and now the wedding-guest
4241,VII.,Turn'd from the bridegroom's door.
4242,VII.,
4243,VII.,"He went, like one that hath been stunn'd"
4244,VII.,And is of sense forlorn:
4245,VII.,A sadder and a wiser man
4246,VII.,"He rose the morrow morn,"

4275,_LINES_,"These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines"
4276,_LINES_,Of sportive wood run wild; these pastoral farms
4277,_LINES_,Green to the very door; and wreathes of smoke
4278,_LINES_,"Sent up, in silence, from among the trees,"
4279,_LINES_,"With some uncertain notice, as might seem,"
4280,_LINES_,"Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,"
4281,_LINES_,"Or of some hermit's cave, where by his fire"

4285,_LINES_,"These forms of beauty have not been to me,"

4287,_LINES_,"But oft, in lonely rooms, and mid the din"

4292,_LINES_,
4293,_LINES_,With tranquil restoration:--feelings too
4294,_LINES_,"Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,"
4295,_LINES_,As may have had no trivial influence
4296,_LINES_,On that best portion of a good man's life;
4297,_LINES_,"His little, nameless, unremembered acts"

4302,_LINES_,In which the heavy and the weary weight
4303,_LINES_,Of all this unintelligible world

4305,_LINES_,"In which the affections gently lead us on,"
4306,_LINES_,"Until, the breath of this corporeal frame,"
4307,_LINES_,And even the motion of our human blood
4308,_LINES_,"Almost suspended, we are laid asleep"
4309,_LINES_,"In body, and become a living soul:"
4310,_LINES_,While with an eye made quiet by the power
4311,_LINES_,"Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,"
4312,_LINES_,We see into the life of things.
4313,_LINES_,
4314,_LINES_,If this
4315,_LINES_,"Be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft,"
4316,_LINES_,"In darkness, and amid the many shapes"
4317,_LINES_,Of joyless day-light; when the fretful stir
4318,_LINES_,"Unprofitable, and the fever of the world,"
4319,_LINES_,"Have hung upon the beatings of my heart,"
4320,_LINES_,"How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee"
4321,_LINES_,"O sylvan Wye! Thou wanderer through the woods,"
4322,_LINES_,How often has my spirit turned to thee!
4323,_LINES_,
4324,_LINES_,"And now, with gleams, of half-extinguish'd thought,"
4325,_LINES_,"With many recognitions dim and faint,"
4326,_LINES_,"And somewhat of a sad perplexity,"
4327,_LINES_,The picture of the mind revives again:
4328,_LINES_,"While here I stand, not only with the sense"
4329,_LINES_,"Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts"
4330,_LINES_,That in this moment there is life and food
4331,_LINES_,For future years. And so I dare to hope
4332,_LINES_,"Though changed, no doubt, from what I was, when first"
4333,_LINES_,I came among these hills; when like a roe
4334,_LINES_,"I bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides"
4335,_LINES_,"Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,"
4336,_LINES_,Wherever nature led: more like a man
4337,_LINES_,"Flying from something that he dreads, than one"
4338,_LINES_,Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then
4339,_LINES_,"(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,"
4340,_LINES_,"And their glad animal movements all gone by,)"
4341,_LINES_,To me was all in all.--I cannot paint
4342,_LINES_,What then I was. The sounding cataract
4343,_LINES_,"Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,"
4344,_LINES_,"The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,"
4345,_LINES_,"Their colours and their forms, were then to me"
4346,_LINES_,"An appetite: a feeling and a love,"
4347,_LINES_,"That had no need of a remoter charm,"
4348,_LINES_,"By thought supplied, or any interest"
4349,_LINES_,"Unborrowed from the eye.--That time is past,"
4350,_LINES_,"And all its aching joys are now no more,"
4351,_LINES_,And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this
4352,_LINES_,"Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur: other gifts"
4353,_LINES_,"Have followed, for such loss, I would believe"
4354,_LINES_,Abundant recompence. For I have learned
4355,_LINES_,"To look on nature, not as in the hour"
4356,_LINES_,"Of thoughtless youth, but hearing oftentimes"
4357,_LINES_,"The still, sad music of humanity,"
4358,_LINES_,"Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power"
4359,_LINES_,To chasten and subdue. And I have felt
4360,_LINES_,A presence that disturbs me with the joy
4361,_LINES_,Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime
4362,_LINES_,"Of something far more deeply interfused,"
4363,_LINES_,"Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,"
4364,_LINES_,"And the round ocean, and the living air,"
4365,_LINES_,"And the blue sky, and in the mind of man,"
4366,_LINES_,"A motion and a spirit, that impels"
4367,_LINES_,"All thinking things, all objects of all thought,"
4368,_LINES_,And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still
4369,_LINES_,"A lover of the meadows and the woods,"
4370,_LINES_,And mountains; and of all that we behold
4371,_LINES_,From this green earth; of all the mighty world
4372,_LINES_,"Of eye and ear; both what they half create, [7]"
4373,_LINES_,And what perceive; well pleased to recognize
4374,_LINES_,"In nature and the language of the sense,"
4375,_LINES_,"The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,"
4376,_LINES_,"The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul"
4377,_LINES_,Of all my moral being.
4378,_LINES_,
4379,_LINES_,[Footnote 7: This line has a close resemblance to an admirable
4380,_LINES_,"line of Young, the exact expression of which I cannot recollect.]"
4381,_LINES_,
4382,_LINES_,"Nor, perchance,"
4383,_LINES_,"If I were not thus taught, should I the more"
4384,_LINES_,Suffer my genial spirits to decay?
4385,_LINES_,"For thou art with me, here, upon the banks"
4386,_LINES_,"Of this fair river; thou, my dearest Friend,"
4387,_LINES_,"My dear, dear Friend, and in thy voice I catch"
4388,_LINES_,"The language of my former heart, and read"
4389,_LINES_,My former pleasures in the shooting lights
4390,_LINES_,Of thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little while
4391,_LINES_,"May I behold in thee what I was once,"
4392,_LINES_,"My dear, dear Sister! And this prayer I make,"
4393,_LINES_,Knowing that Nature never did betray
4394,_LINES_,"The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,"
4395,_LINES_,"Through all the years of this our life, to lead"
4396,_LINES_,From joy to joy: for she can so inform
4397,_LINES_,"The mind that is within us, so impress"
4398,_LINES_,"With quietness and beauty, and so feed"
4399,_LINES_,"With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,"
4400,_LINES_,"Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,"
4401,_LINES_,"Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all"
4402,_LINES_,"The dreary intercourse of daily life,"
4403,_LINES_,"Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb"
4404,_LINES_,Our chearful faith that all which we behold
4405,_LINES_,Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon
4406,_LINES_,Shine on thee in thy solitary walk;
4407,_LINES_,And let the misty mountain winds be free
4408,_LINES_,"To blow against thee: and in after years,"
4409,_LINES_,When these wild ecstasies shall be matured
4410,_LINES_,"Into a sober pleasure, when thy mind"
4411,_LINES_,"Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,"
4412,_LINES_,Thy memory be as a dwelling-place
4413,_LINES_,"For all sweet sounds and harmonies; Oh! then,"
4414,_LINES_,"If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,"
4415,_LINES_,"Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts"
4416,_LINES_,"Of tender joy wilt thou remember me,"
4417,_LINES_,"And these my exhortations! Nor perchance,"
4418,_LINES_,"If I should be, where I no more can hear"
4419,_LINES_,"Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams"
4420,_LINES_,"Of past existence, wilt thou then forget"
4421,_LINES_,That on the banks of this delightful stream
4422,_LINES_,"We stood together; and that I, so long"
4423,_LINES_,"A worshipper of Nature, hither came,"
4424,_LINES_,Unwearied in that service: rather say
4425,_LINES_,"With warmer love, oh! with far deeper zeal"
4426,_LINES_,"Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,"
4427,_LINES_,"That after many wanderings, many years"
4428,_LINES_,"Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,"
4429,_LINES_,"And this green pastoral landscape, were to me"

4439,_NOTES_,
4440,_NOTES_,NOTE to THE THORN--This Poem ought to have been preceded by an
4441,_NOTES_,"introductory Poem, which I have been prevented from writing by never"
4442,_NOTES_,having felt myself in a mood when it was probable that I should
4443,_NOTES_,write it well.--The character which I have here introduced speaking
4444,_NOTES_,is sufficiently common. The Reader will perhaps have a general
4445,_NOTES_,"notion of it, if he has ever known a man, a Captain of a small"
4446,_NOTES_,"trading vessel for example, who being past the middle age of life,"
4447,_NOTES_,had retired upon an annuity or small independent income to some
4448,_NOTES_,"village or country town of which he was not a native, or in which he"
4449,_NOTES_,had not been accustomed to live. Such men having little to do become
4450,_NOTES_,"credulous and talkative from indolence; and from the same cause, and"
4451,_NOTES_,other predisposing causes by which it is probable that such men may
4452,_NOTES_,"have been affected, they are prone to superstition. On which account"
4453,_NOTES_,it appeared to me proper to select a character like this to exhibit
4454,_NOTES_,some of the general laws by which superstition acts upon the mind.
4455,_NOTES_,Superstitious men are almost always men of slow faculties and deep
4456,_NOTES_,feelings; their minds are not loose but adhesive; they have a
4457,_NOTES_,"reasonable share of imagination, by which word I mean the faculty"
4458,_NOTES_,which produces impressive effects out of simple elements; but they
4459,_NOTES_,"are utterly destitute of fancy, the power by which pleasure and"
4460,_NOTES_,surprize are excited by sudden varieties of situation and by
4461,_NOTES_,accumulated imagery.
4462,_NOTES_,
4463,_NOTES_,It was my wish in this poem to shew the manner in which such men
4464,_NOTES_,"cleave to the same ideas; and to follow the turns of passion, always"
4465,_NOTES_,"different, yet not palpably different, by which their conversation"
4466,_NOTES_,"is swayed. I had two objects to attain; first, to represent a"
4467,_NOTES_,picture which should not be unimpressive yet consistent with the
4468,_NOTES_,"character that should describe it, secondly, while I adhered to the"
4469,_NOTES_,"style in which such persons describe, to take care that words, which"
4470,_NOTES_,"in their minds are impregnated with passion, should likewise convey"
4471,_NOTES_,passion to Readers who are not accustomed to sympathize with men
4472,_NOTES_,feeling in that manner or using such language. It seemed to me that
4473,_NOTES_,this might be done by calling in the assistance of Lyrical and rapid
4474,_NOTES_,"Metre. It was necessary that the Poem, to be natural, should in"
4475,_NOTES_,"reality move slowly; yet I hoped, that, by the aid of the metre, to"
4476,_NOTES_,"those who should at all enter into the spirit of the Poem, it would"
4477,_NOTES_,appear to move quickly. The Reader will have the kindness to excuse
4478,_NOTES_,this note as I am sensible that an introductory Poem is necessary to
4479,_NOTES_,give this Poem its full effect.
4480,_NOTES_,
4481,_NOTES_,Upon this occasion I will request permission to add a few words
4482,_NOTES_,closely connected with THE THORN and many other Poems in these
4483,_NOTES_,Volumes. There is a numerous class of readers who imagine that the
4484,_NOTES_,same words cannot be repeated without tautology: this is a great
4485,_NOTES_,error: virtual tautology is much oftener produced by using different
4486,_NOTES_,"words when the meaning is exactly the same. Words, a Poet's words"
4487,_NOTES_,"more particularly, ought to be weighed in the balance of feeling and"
4488,_NOTES_,not measured by the space which they occupy upon paper. For the
4489,_NOTES_,Reader cannot be too often reminded that Poetry is passion: it is
4490,_NOTES_,the history or science of feelings: now every man must know that an
4491,_NOTES_,attempt is rarely made to communicate impassioned feelings without
4492,_NOTES_,something of an accompanying consciousness of the inadequateness of
4493,_NOTES_,"our own powers, or the deficiencies of language. During such efforts"
4494,_NOTES_,"there will be a craving in the mind, and as long as it is"
4495,_NOTES_,"unsatisfied the Speaker will cling to the same words, or words of"
4496,_NOTES_,the same character. There are also various other reasons why
4497,_NOTES_,repetition and apparent tautology are frequently beauties of the
4498,_NOTES_,highest kind. Among the chief of these reasons is the interest which
4499,_NOTES_,"the mind attaches to words, not only as symbols of the passion, but"
4500,_NOTES_,"as _things_, active and efficient, which are of themselves part of"
4501,_NOTES_,"the passion. And further, from a spirit of fondness, exultation, and"
4502,_NOTES_,"gratitude, the mind luxuriates in the repetition of words which"
4503,_NOTES_,appear successfully to communicate its feelings. The truth of these
4504,_NOTES_,remarks might be shewn by innumerable passages from the Bible and
4505,_NOTES_,from the impassioned poetry of every nation.

4519,_NOTES_,"NOTE to the ANCIENT MARINER, p. 155.--I cannot refuse myself the"
4520,_NOTES_,gratification of informing such Readers as may have been pleased
4521,_NOTES_,"with this Poem, or with any part of it, that they owe their pleasure"
4522,_NOTES_,in some sort to me; as the Author was himself very desirous that it
4523,_NOTES_,should be suppressed. This wish had arisen from a consciousness of
4524,_NOTES_,"the defects of the Poem, and from a knowledge that many persons had"
4525,_NOTES_,been much displeased with it. The Poem of my Friend has indeed great
4526,_NOTES_,"defects; first, that the principal person has no distinct character,"
4527,_NOTES_,"either in his profession of Mariner, or as a human being who having"
4528,_NOTES_,been long under the controul of supernatural impressions might be
4529,_NOTES_,"supposed himself to partake of something supernatural: secondly,"
4530,_NOTES_,"that he does not act, but is continually acted upon: thirdly, that"
4531,_NOTES_,the events having no necessary connection do not produce each other;
4532,_NOTES_,"and lastly, that the imagery is somewhat too laboriously accumulated."
4533,_NOTES_,"Yet the Poem contains many delicate touches of passion, and indeed"
4534,_NOTES_,the passion is every where true to nature; a great number of the
4535,_NOTES_,"stanzas present beautiful images, and are expressed with unusual"
4536,_NOTES_,"felicity of language; and the versification, though the metre is"
4537,_NOTES_,"itself unfit for long poems, is harmonious and artfully varied,"
4538,_NOTES_,"exhibiting the utmost powers of that metre, and every variety of"
4539,_NOTES_,which it is capable. It therefore appeared to me that these several
4540,_NOTES_,"merits (the first of which, namely that of the passion, is of the"
4541,_NOTES_,"highest kind,) gave to the Poem a value which is not often possessed"
4542,_NOTES_,by better Poems. On this account I requested of my Friend to permit
4543,_NOTES_,me to republish it.

4548,_NOTES_,found the principal requisites of that species of composition.
