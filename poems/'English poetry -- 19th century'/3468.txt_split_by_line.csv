90,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.
91,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,
92,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,
93,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"Shall we wake one morn of spring,"
94,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"Glad at heart of everything,"
95,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,Yet pensive with the thought of eve?
96,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"Then the white house shall we leave,"
97,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"Pass the wind-flowers and the bays,"
98,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"Through the garth, and go our ways,"
99,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,Wandering down among the meads
100,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,Till our very joyance needs
101,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,Rest at last; till we shall come
102,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"To that Sun-god's lonely home,"
103,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"Lonely on the hill-side grey,"
104,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,Whence the sheep have gone away;
105,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"Lonely till the feast-time is,"
106,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"When with prayer and praise of bliss,"
107,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,Thither comes the country side.
108,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"There awhile shall we abide,"
109,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,Sitting low down in the porch
110,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,By that image with the torch:
111,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,Thy one white hand laid upon
112,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,The black pillar that was won
113,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,From the far-off Indian mine;
114,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"And my hand nigh touching thine,"
115,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,But not touching; and thy gown
116,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,Fair with spring-flowers cast adown
117,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,From thy bosom and thy brow.
118,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,There the south-west wind shall blow
119,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"Through thine hair to reach my cheek,"
120,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"As thou sittest, nor mayst speak,"
121,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,Nor mayst move the hand I kiss
122,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,For the very depth of bliss;
123,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"Nay, nor turn thine eyes to me."
124,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,Then desire of the great sea
125,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"Nigh enow, but all unheard,"
126,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"In the hearts of us is stirred,"
127,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"And we rise, we twain at last,"
128,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"And the daffodils downcast,"
129,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,Feel thy feet and we are gone
130,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,From the lonely Sun-Crowned one.
131,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"Then the meads fade at our back,"
132,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,And the spring day 'gins to lack
133,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,That fresh hope that once it had;
134,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"But we twain grow yet more glad,"
135,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,And apart no more may go
136,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,When the grassy slope and low
137,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,Dieth in the shingly sand:
138,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,Then we wander hand in hand
139,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"By the edges of the sea,"
140,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,And I weary more for thee
141,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"Than if far apart we were,"
142,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,With a space of desert drear
143,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"'Twixt thy lips and mine, O love!"
144,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,"Ah, my joy, my joy thereof!"
145,FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA.,

153,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",
154,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","At Deildar-Tongue in the autumn-tide,"
155,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","_So many times over comes summer again_,"
156,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",Stood Odd of Tongue his door beside.
157,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",_What healing in summer if winter be vain_?
158,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Dim and dusk the day was grown,"
159,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",As he heard his folded wethers moan.
160,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Then through the garth a man drew near,"
161,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",With painted shield and gold-wrought spear.
162,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Good was his horse and grand his gear,"
163,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And his girths were wet with Whitewater.
164,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""Hail, Master Odd, live blithe and long!"
165,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","How fare the folk at Deildar-Tongue?"""
166,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""All hail, thou Hallbiorn the Strong!"
167,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","How fare the folk by the Brothers'-Tongue?"""
168,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""Meat have we there, and drink and fire,"
169,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",Nor lack all things that we desire.
170,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",But by the other Whitewater
171,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Of Hallgerd many a tale we hear."""
172,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""Tales enow may my daughter make"
173,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","If too many words be said for her sake."""
174,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""What saith thine heart to a word of mine,"
175,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",That I deem thy daughter fair and fine?
176,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Fair and fine for a bride is she,"
177,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","And I fain would have her home with me."""
178,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""Full many a word that at noon goes forth"
179,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",Comes home at even little worth.
180,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Now winter treadeth on autumn-tide,"
181,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",So here till the spring shalt thou abide.
182,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Then if thy mind be changed no whit,"
183,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","And ye still will wed, see ye to it!"
184,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","And on the first of summer days,"
185,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","A wedded man, ye may go your ways."
186,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Yet look, howso the thing will fall,"
187,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",My hand shall meddle nought at all.
188,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Lo, now the night and rain draweth up,"
189,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And within doors glimmer stoop and cup.
190,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","And hark, a little sound I know,"
191,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","The laugh of Snaebiorn's fiddle-bow,"
192,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","My sister's son, and a craftsman good,"
193,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","When the red rain drives through the iron wood."""
194,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Hallbiorn laughed, and followed in,"
195,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And a merry feast there did begin.
196,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Hallgerd's hands undid his weed,"
197,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",Hallgerd's hands poured out the mead.
198,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Her fingers at his breast he felt,"
199,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",As her hair fell down about his belt.
200,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Her fingers with the cup he took,"
201,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And o'er its rim at her did look.
202,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Cold cup, warm hand, and fingers slim,"
203,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",Before his eyes were waxen dim.
204,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","And if the feast were foul or fair,"
205,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","He knew not, save that she was there."
206,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","He knew not if men laughed or wept,"
207,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",While still 'twixt wall and dais she stept.
208,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Whether she went or stood that eve,"
209,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",Not once his eyes her face did leave.
210,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","But Snaebiorn laughed and Snaebiorn sang,"
211,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And sweet his smitten fiddle rang.
212,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","And Hallgerd stood beside him there,"
213,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","_So many times over comes summer again_,"
214,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Nor ever once he turned to her,"
215,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",_What healing in summer if winter be vain_?
216,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",
217,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Master Odd on the morrow spake,"
218,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",_So many times over comes summer again_.
219,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""Hearken, O guest, if ye be awake,"""
220,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",_What healing in summer if winter be vain_?
221,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""Sure ye champions of the south"
222,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",Speak many things from a silent mouth.
223,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","And thine, meseems, last night did pray"
224,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",That ye might well be wed to-day.
225,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","The year's ingathering feast it is,"
226,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",A goodly day to give thee bliss.
227,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Come hither, daughter, fine and fair,"
228,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",Here is a Wooer from Whitewater.
229,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","East away hath he gotten fame,"
230,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And his father's name is e'en my names.
231,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Will ye lay hand within his hand,"
232,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","That blossoming fair our house may stand?"""
233,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",She laid her hand within his hand;
234,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",White she was as the lily wand.
235,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Low sang Snaebiorn's brand in its sheath,"
236,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And his lips were waxen grey as death.
237,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""Snaebiorn, sing us a song of worth,"
238,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","If your song must be silent from now henceforth."""
239,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Clear and loud his voice outrang,"
240,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And a song of worth at the wedding he sang.
241,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""Sharp sword,"" he sang, ""and death is sure."""
242,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","_So many times over comes summer again_,"
243,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""But love doth over all endure."""
244,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",_What healing in summer if winter be vain_?
245,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",
246,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Now winter cometh and weareth away,"
247,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","_So many times over comes summer again_,"
248,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And glad is Hallbiorn many a day.
249,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",_What healing in summer if winter be vain_?
250,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",Full soft he lay his love beside;
251,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",But dark are the days of wintertide.
252,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Dark are the days, and the nights are long,"
253,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And sweet and fair was Snaebiorn's song.
254,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Many a time he talked with her,"
255,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",Till they deemed the summer-tide was there.
256,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And they forgat the wind-swept ways
257,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And angry fords of the flitting-days.
258,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",While the north wind swept the hillside there
259,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",They forgat the other Whitewater.
260,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","While nights at Deildar-Tongue were long,"
261,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",They clean forgat the Brothers'-Tongue.
262,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","But whatso falleth 'twixt Hell and Home,"
263,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","_So many times over comes summer again_,"
264,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",Full surely again shall summer come.
265,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",_What healing in summer if winter be vain_?
266,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",
267,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",To Odd spake Hallbiorn on a day
268,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","_So many times over comes summer again_,"
269,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""Gone is the snow from everyway."""
270,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",_What healing in summer if winter be vain_?
271,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Now green is grown Whitewater-side,"
272,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","And I to Whitewater will ride."""
273,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Quoth Odd, ""Well fare thou winter-guest,"
274,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",May thine own Whitewater be best.
275,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",Well is a man's purse better at home
276,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Than open where folk go and come."""
277,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""Come ye carles of the south country,"
278,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",Now shall we go our kin to see!
279,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","For the lambs are bleating in the south,"
280,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And the salmon swims towards Olfus mouth.
281,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",Girth and graithe and gather your gear!
282,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","And ho for the other Whitewater!"""
283,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Bright was the moon as bright might be,"
284,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And Snaebiorn rode to the north country.
285,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","And Odd to Reykholt is gone forth,"
286,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",To see if his mares be ought of worth.
287,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",But Hallbiorn into the bower is gone
288,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And there sat Hallgerd all alone.
289,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",She was not dight to go nor ride
290,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",She had no joy of the summer-tide.
291,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Silent she sat and combed her hair,"
292,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",That fell all round about her there.
293,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","The slant beam lay upon her head,"
294,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And gilt her golden locks to red.
295,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",He gazed at her with hungry eyes
296,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And fluttering did his heart arise.
297,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""Full hot,"" he said, ""is the sun to-day,"
298,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And the snow is gone from the mountain-way.
299,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","The king-cup grows above the grass,"
300,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","And through the wood do the thrushes pass."""
301,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Of all his words she hearkened none,"
302,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",But combed her hair amidst the sun.
303,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""The laden beasts stand in the garth"
304,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","And their heads are turned to Helliskarth."""
305,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","The sun was falling on her knee,"
306,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And she combed her gold hair silently.
307,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""To-morrow great will be the cheer"
308,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","At the Brothers'-Tongue by Whitewater."""
309,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",From her folded lap the sunbeam slid;
310,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","She combed her hair, and the word she hid."
311,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""Come, love; is the way so long and drear"
312,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","From Whitewater to Whitewater?"""
313,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",The sunbeam lay upon the floor;
314,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",She combed her hair and spake no more.
315,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",He drew her by the lily hand:
316,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""I love thee better than all the land."""
317,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",He drew her by the shoulders sweet:
318,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""My threshold is but for thy feet."""
319,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",He drew her by the yellow hair:
320,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""O why wert thou so deadly fair?"
321,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""O am I wedded to death?"" he cried"
322,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""Is the Dead-strand come to Whitewater side?"""
323,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","And the sun was fading from the room,"
324,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",But her eyes were bright in the change and the gloom.
325,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","""Sharp sword,"" she sang, ""and death is sure,"
326,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","But over all doth love endure."""
327,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",She stood up shining in her place
328,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And laughed beneath his deadly face.
329,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Instead of the sunbeam gleamed a brand,"
330,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",The hilts were hard in Hallbiorn's hand:
331,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",The bitter point was in Hallgerd's breast
332,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",That Snaebiorn's lips of love had pressed.
333,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Morn and noon, and nones passed o'er,"
334,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",And the sun is far from the bower door.
335,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","To-morrow morn shall the sun come back,"
336,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","_So many times over comes summer again_,"
337,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",But Hallgerd's feet the floor shall lack.
338,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",_What healing in summer if winter be vain_?
339,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",
340,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","Now Hallbiorn's house-carles ride full fast,"
341,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.","_So many times over comes summer again_,"
342,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",Till many a mile of way is past.
343,"SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND, CHAPTER XXX.",_What healing in summer if winter be vain_?

1197,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,"Is it enough for our rest,"
1198,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,"the sight of this desolate strand,"
1199,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,And the mountain-waste voiceless as death

1247,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,thy voice hath amidst of its wail:
1248,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,More hope than of pleasure fulfilled
1249,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,amidst of thy blindness is set;
1250,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,More glorious than gaining of all
1251,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,thine unfaltering hand that shall fail:
1252,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,For what is the mark on thy brow
1253,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,but the brand that thy Brynhild doth bear?
1254,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,"Lone once, and loved and undone"
1255,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,by a love that no ages outwear.
1256,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,
1257,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,"Ah! when thy Balder comes back,"
1258,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,and bears from the heart of the Sun
1259,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,"Peace and the healing of pain,"
1260,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,and the wisdom that waiteth no more;
1261,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,And the lilies are laid on thy brow
1262,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,'mid the crown of the deeds thou hast done;
1263,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,And the roses spring up by thy feet
1264,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,that the rocks of the wilderness wore.
1265,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,Ah! when thy Balder comes back
1266,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,"and we gather the gains he hath won,"
1267,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,Shall we not linger a little
1268,ICELAND FIRST SEEN,"to talk of thy sweetness of old,"

2252,MOTHER AND SON.,"Hand in hand with my love,"

2254,MOTHER AND SON.,When the river of love o'erflowed
2255,MOTHER AND SON.,"and drowned all doubt and fear,"
2256,MOTHER AND SON.,"And we two were alone in the world,"
2257,MOTHER AND SON.,"and once if never again,"
2258,MOTHER AND SON.,We knew of the secret of earth

2299,MOTHER AND SON.,"Now, to thee alone will I tell it"

2313,MOTHER AND SON.,The hair that thy small hand clutcheth
2314,MOTHER AND SON.,is a goodly sight to see;
2315,MOTHER AND SON.,"I am true, but my face is a snare;"
2316,MOTHER AND SON.,"soft and deep are my eyes,"
2317,MOTHER AND SON.,And they seem for men's beguiling
2318,MOTHER AND SON.,fulfilled with the dreams of the wise.
2319,MOTHER AND SON.,"Kind are my lips, and they look"
2320,MOTHER AND SON.,as though my soul had learned
2321,MOTHER AND SON.,"Deep things I have never heard of,"
2322,MOTHER AND SON.,my face and my hands are burned
2323,MOTHER AND SON.,By the lovely sun of the acres;
2324,MOTHER AND SON.,three months of London town
2325,MOTHER AND SON.,"And thy birth-bed have bleached them indeed,"
2326,MOTHER AND SON.,"""But lo, where the edge of the gown"""
2327,MOTHER AND SON.,"(So said thy father) ""is parting"
2328,MOTHER AND SON.,the wrist that is white as the curd

2330,MOTHER AND SON.,"bright as the wing of a bird."""
2331,MOTHER AND SON.,
2332,MOTHER AND SON.,"Such is thy mother, O firstling,"
2333,MOTHER AND SON.,"yet strong as the maidens of old,"
2334,MOTHER AND SON.,Whose spears and whose swords were the warders
2335,MOTHER AND SON.,"of homestead, of field and of fold."
2336,MOTHER AND SON.,"Oft were my feet on the highway,"
2337,MOTHER AND SON.,often they wearied the grass;
2338,MOTHER AND SON.,From dusk unto dusk of the summer
2339,MOTHER AND SON.,three times in a week would I pass
2340,MOTHER AND SON.,To the downs from the house on the river
2341,MOTHER AND SON.,through the waves of the blossoming corn.
2342,MOTHER AND SON.,"Fair then I lay down in the even,"
2343,MOTHER AND SON.,"and fresh I arose on the morn,"
2344,MOTHER AND SON.,And scarce in the noon was I weary.
2345,MOTHER AND SON.,"Ah, son, in the days of thy strife,"
2346,MOTHER AND SON.,If thy soul could but harbour a dream
2347,MOTHER AND SON.,of the blossom of my life!
2348,MOTHER AND SON.,It would be as the sunlit meadows
2349,MOTHER AND SON.,"beheld from a tossing sea,"
2350,MOTHER AND SON.,And thy soul should look on a vision
2351,MOTHER AND SON.,of the peace that is to be.
2352,MOTHER AND SON.,
2353,MOTHER AND SON.,"Yet, yet the tears on my cheek!"
2354,MOTHER AND SON.,and what is this doth move
2355,MOTHER AND SON.,"My heart to thy heart, beloved,"
2356,MOTHER AND SON.,save the flood of yearning love?
2357,MOTHER AND SON.,"For fair and fierce is thy father,"
2358,MOTHER AND SON.,and soft and strange are his eyes
2359,MOTHER AND SON.,That look on the days that shall be
2360,MOTHER AND SON.,with the hope of the brave and the wise.
2361,MOTHER AND SON.,"It was many a day that we laughed,"
2362,MOTHER AND SON.,"as over the meadows we walked,"
2363,MOTHER AND SON.,And many a day I hearkened
2364,MOTHER AND SON.,and the pictures came as he talked;
2365,MOTHER AND SON.,"It was many a day that we longed,"
2366,MOTHER AND SON.,and we lingered late at eve
2367,MOTHER AND SON.,"Ere speech from speech was sundered,"
2368,MOTHER AND SON.,and my hand his hand could leave.
2369,MOTHER AND SON.,"Then I wept when I was alone,"
2370,MOTHER AND SON.,and I longed till the daylight came;
2371,MOTHER AND SON.,"And down the stairs I stole,"
2372,MOTHER AND SON.,and there was our housekeeping dame
2373,MOTHER AND SON.,"(No mother of me, the foundling)"
2374,MOTHER AND SON.,kindling the fire betimes
2375,MOTHER AND SON.,Ere the haymaking folk went forth
2376,MOTHER AND SON.,to the meadows down by the limes;
2377,MOTHER AND SON.,All things I saw at a glance;
2378,MOTHER AND SON.,the quickening fire-tongues leapt
2379,MOTHER AND SON.,"Through the crackling heap of sticks,"
2380,MOTHER AND SON.,"and the sweet smoke up from it crept,"
2381,MOTHER AND SON.,And close to the very hearth
2382,MOTHER AND SON.,"the low sun flooded the floor,"
2383,MOTHER AND SON.,And the cat and her kittens played
2384,MOTHER AND SON.,in the sun by the open door.
2385,MOTHER AND SON.,"The garden was fair in the morning,"
2386,MOTHER AND SON.,and there in the road he stood
2387,MOTHER AND SON.,Beyond the crimson daisies
2388,MOTHER AND SON.,and the bush of southernwood.
2389,MOTHER AND SON.,Then side by side together
2390,MOTHER AND SON.,"through the grey-walled place we went,"
2391,MOTHER AND SON.,"And O the fear departed,"
2392,MOTHER AND SON.,and the rest and sweet content!
2393,MOTHER AND SON.,
2394,MOTHER AND SON.,"Son, sorrow and wisdom he taught me,"
2395,MOTHER AND SON.,and sore I grieved and learned
2396,MOTHER AND SON.,As we twain grew into one;
2397,MOTHER AND SON.,and the heart within me burned
2398,MOTHER AND SON.,With the very hopes of his heart.
2399,MOTHER AND SON.,"Ah, son, it is piteous,"
2400,MOTHER AND SON.,But never again in my life
2401,MOTHER AND SON.,shall I dare to speak to thee thus;
2402,MOTHER AND SON.,So may these lonely words
2403,MOTHER AND SON.,"about thee creep and cling,"
2404,MOTHER AND SON.,These words of the lonely night
2405,MOTHER AND SON.,in the days of our wayfaring.
2406,MOTHER AND SON.,Many a child of woman
2407,MOTHER AND SON.,"to-night is born in the town,"
2408,MOTHER AND SON.,The desert of folly and wrong;
2409,MOTHER AND SON.,and of what and whence are they grown?
2410,MOTHER AND SON.,Many and many an one
2411,MOTHER AND SON.,of wont and use is born;
2412,MOTHER AND SON.,For a husband is taken to bed
2413,MOTHER AND SON.,as a hat or a ribbon is worn.
2414,MOTHER AND SON.,Prudence begets her thousands;
2415,MOTHER AND SON.,"""good is a housekeeper's life,"
2416,MOTHER AND SON.,So shall I sell my body
2417,MOTHER AND SON.,"that I may be matron and wife."""
2418,MOTHER AND SON.,"""And I shall endure foul wedlock"
2419,MOTHER AND SON.,"and bear the children of need."""
2420,MOTHER AND SON.,"Some are there born of hate,"
2421,MOTHER AND SON.,many the children of greed.
2422,MOTHER AND SON.,"""I, I too can be wedded,"
2423,MOTHER AND SON.,"though thou my love hast got."""
2424,MOTHER AND SON.,"""I am fair and hard of heart,"
2425,MOTHER AND SON.,"and riches shall be my lot."""
2426,MOTHER AND SON.,"And all these are the good and the happy,"
2427,MOTHER AND SON.,on whom the world dawns fair.
2428,MOTHER AND SON.,"O son, when wilt thou learn"
2429,MOTHER AND SON.,"of those that are born of despair,"
2430,MOTHER AND SON.,As the fabled mud of the Nile
2431,MOTHER AND SON.,that quickens under the sun
2432,MOTHER AND SON.,"With a growth of creeping things,"
2433,MOTHER AND SON.,half dead when just begun?
2434,MOTHER AND SON.,E'en such is the care of Nature
2435,MOTHER AND SON.,"that man should never die,"
2436,MOTHER AND SON.,"Though she breed of the fools of the earth,"
2437,MOTHER AND SON.,and the dregs of the city sty.
2438,MOTHER AND SON.,"But thou, O son, O son,"
2439,MOTHER AND SON.,"of very love wert born,"
2440,MOTHER AND SON.,"When our hope fulfilled bred hope,"
2441,MOTHER AND SON.,and fear was a folly outworn.
2442,MOTHER AND SON.,On the eve of the toil and the battle
2443,MOTHER AND SON.,"all sorrow and grief we weighed,"
2444,MOTHER AND SON.,"We hoped and we were not ashamed,"
2445,MOTHER AND SON.,we knew and we were not afraid.
2446,MOTHER AND SON.,
2447,MOTHER AND SON.,Now waneth the night and the moon;
2448,MOTHER AND SON.,"ah, son, it is piteous"
2449,MOTHER AND SON.,That never again in my life
2450,MOTHER AND SON.,shall I dare to speak to thee thus.
2451,MOTHER AND SON.,But sure from the wise and the simple
2452,MOTHER AND SON.,shall the mighty come to birth;
2453,MOTHER AND SON.,"And fair were my fate, beloved,"
2454,MOTHER AND SON.,if I be yet on the earth
2455,MOTHER AND SON.,"When the world is awaken at last,"
2456,MOTHER AND SON.,and from mouth to mouth they tell
2457,MOTHER AND SON.,"Of thy love and thy deeds and thy valour,"
2458,MOTHER AND SON.,and thy hope that nought can quell.

3054,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And Gregory the Wright was one
3055,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,"Of the valiant men beneath the sun,"
3056,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3057,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And what he bade us that we did

3063,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,"It was dark in the porch, but our scythes we felt,"
3064,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And thrust the whetstone under the belt.
3065,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3066,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,Through the cold garden boughs we went
3067,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,Where the tumbling roses shed their scent.
3068,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3069,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,Then out a-gates and away we strode
3070,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,"O'er the dewy straws on the dusty road,"
3071,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3072,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And there was the mead by the town-reeve's close
3073,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,Where the hedge was sweet with the wilding rose.
3074,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3075,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,Then into the mowing grass we went
3076,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,Ere the very last of the night was spent.
3077,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3078,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,"Young was the moon, and he was gone,"

3088,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,The black-bird's bill had answered him.
3089,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3090,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,Ere half of the road to the river was shorn

3110,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,"We looked along the new-shorn hay,"
3111,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3112,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And heard the voice of the gathering-horn
3113,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,Come over the garden and the corn;
3114,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3115,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,For the wind was in the blossoming wheat
3116,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And drave the bees in the lime-boughs sweet.
3117,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3118,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,"Then loud was the horn's voice drawing near,"
3119,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And it hid the talk of the prattling weir.
3120,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3121,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And now was the horn on the pathway wide
3122,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,That we had shorn to the river-side.
3123,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3124,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,"So up we stood, and wide around"
3125,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,We sheared a space by the Elders' Mound;
3126,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3127,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And at the feet thereof it was
3128,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,That highest grew the June-tide grass;
3129,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3130,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And over all the mound it grew
3131,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,"With clover blent, and dark of hue."
3132,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3133,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,But never aught of the Elders' Hay
3134,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,To rick or barn was borne away.
3135,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3136,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,But it was bound and burned to ash
3137,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,In the barren close by the reedy plash.
3138,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3139,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,For 'neath that mound the valiant dead
3140,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,Lay hearkening words of valiance said
3141,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3142,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,"When wise men stood on the Elders' Mound,"

3146,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3147,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And now we saw the banners borne
3148,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,On the first of the way that we had shorn;
3149,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,So we laid the scythe upon the sward
3150,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And girt us to the battle-sword.
3151,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3152,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,For after the banners well we knew
3153,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,Were the Freemen wending two and two.
3154,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3155,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,There then that high-way of the scythe
3156,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,With many a hue was brave and blythe.

3158,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And first below the Silver Chief
3159,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,Upon the green was the golden sheaf.
3160,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3161,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And on the next that went by it
3162,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,The White Hart in the Park did sit.
3163,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3164,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,"Then on the red the White Wings flew,"
3165,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And on the White was the Cloud-fleck blue.
3166,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,

3168,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,Beside the Ship of the Faring-Knights.
3169,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3170,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,Then thronged the folk the June-tide field
3171,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,"With naked sword and painted shield,"
3172,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3173,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,"Till they came adown to the river-side,"

3180,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3181,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,There rose a man on the mound alone
3182,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And over his head was the grey mail done.
3183,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3184,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,When over the new-shorn place of the field
3185,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,Was nought but the steel hood and the shield.
3186,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3187,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,"The face on the mound shone ruddy and hale,"
3188,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,But the hoar hair showed from the hoary mail.
3189,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3190,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And there rose a hand by the ruddy face
3191,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And shook a sword o'er the peopled place.
3192,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,
3193,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,And there came a voice from the mound and said:
3194,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,"""O sons, the days of my youth are dead,"
3195,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER.,

5713,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Let him bring aback the light and the day,"
5714,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And rich and in peace he shall go his way."""
5715,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,

5718,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5719,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"But I for the deed a gift shall gain,"

5721,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5722,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"I shall sit at the board by the bride-groom's side,"
5723,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And be betwixt him and the bride.
5724,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5725,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"I shall eat of his dish and drink of his cup,"
5726,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Until for the bride-bed ye rise up."""
5727,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5728,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Then was the Queen's word wailing-wild:
5729,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""E'en so must it be, thou Angel's child."
5730,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5731,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Thou shalt sit by my groom till the dawn of night,"
5732,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And then shalt thou wend thy ways aright."""
5733,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5734,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Said the voice, ""Yet shalt thou swear an oath"

5742,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5743,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"She swore the oath, and then she spake:"
5744,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""Now let the second dawn awake."""
5745,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5746,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And e'en therewith the thing was done;
5747,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"There was peace in the hall, and the light of the sun."
5748,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5749,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And again the Queen was calm and fair,"
5750,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And courteous sat the guest-folk there.
5751,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5752,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Yet unto Goldilocks it seemed
5753,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,As if amidst the night he dreamed;
5754,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5755,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"As if he sat in a grassy place,"
5756,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,While slim hands framed his hungry face;
5757,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5758,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,As if in the clearing of the wood
5759,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,One gave him bread and apples good;
5760,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5761,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And nought he saw of the guest-folk gay,"
5762,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And nought of all the Queen's array.
5763,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5764,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Yet saw he betwixt board and door,"
5765,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,A slim maid tread the chequered floor.
5766,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5767,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Her gown of green so fair was wrought,"
5768,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,That clad her body seemed with nought
5769,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5770,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"But blossoms of the summer-tide,"
5771,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"That wreathed her, limbs and breast and side."
5772,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5773,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And, stepping towards him daintily,"
5774,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,A basket in her hand had she.
5775,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5776,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And as she went, from head to feet,"
5777,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Surely was she most dainty-sweet.
5778,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5779,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Love floated round her, and her eyes"
5780,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Gazed from her fairness glad and wise;
5781,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5782,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,But babbling-loud the guests were grown;
5783,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Unnoted was she and unknown.

5785,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,* * * * *
5786,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5787,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Now Goldilocks she sat beside,"
5788,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,But nothing changed was the Queenly bride;
5789,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5790,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Yea too, and Goldilocks the Swain"
5791,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Was grown but dull and dazed again.
5792,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5793,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"The Queen smiled o'er the guest-rich board,"
5794,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Although his wine the Maiden poured;
5795,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5796,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Though from his dish the Maiden ate,"
5797,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,The Queen sat happy and sedate.
5798,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5799,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,But now the Maiden fell to speak
5800,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,From lips that well-nigh touched his cheek:
5801,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5802,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""O Goldilocks, dost thou forget?"
5803,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Or mindest thou the mirk-wood yet?
5804,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5805,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Forgettest thou the hunger-pain
5806,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And all thy young life made but vain?
5807,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5808,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"How there was nought to help or aid,"
5809,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"But for poor Goldilocks the Maid?"""
5810,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5811,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"She murmured, ""Each to each we two,"
5812,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Our faces from the wood-mirk grew.
5813,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5814,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Hast thou forgot the grassy place,"
5815,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And love betwixt us face to face?
5816,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5817,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Hast thou forgot how fair I deemed
5818,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Thy face?  How fair thy garment seemed?
5819,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5820,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Thy kisses on my shoulders bare,"
5821,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Through rents of the poor raiment there?
5822,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5823,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,My arms that loved thee nought unkissed
5824,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,All o'er from shoulder unto wrist?
5825,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5826,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Hast thou forgot how brave thou wert,"
5827,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Thou with thy fathers' weapon girt;
5828,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5829,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,When underneath the bramble-bush
5830,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"I quaked like river-shaken rush,"
5831,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5832,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Wondering what new-wrought shape of death
5833,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Should quench my new love-quickened breath?
5834,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5835,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Or else: forget'st thou, Goldilocks,"
5836,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Thine own land of the wheaten shocks?
5837,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5838,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Thy mother and thy sisters dear,"
5839,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Thou said'st would bide thy true-love there?
5840,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5841,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Hast thou forgot?  Hast thou forgot?
5842,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"O love, my love, I move thee not."""

5844,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,* * * * *
5845,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5846,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Silent the fair Queen sat and smiled
5847,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And heeded nought the Angel's child,"
5848,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5849,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,For like an image fashioned fair
5850,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Still sat the Swain with empty stare.
5851,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5852,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"These words seemed spoken not, but writ"
5853,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,As foolish tales through night-dreams flit.
5854,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5855,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Vague pictures passed before his sight,"
5856,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,As in the first dream of the night.
5857,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5858,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,* * * * *
5859,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5860,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"But the Maiden opened her basket fair,"
5861,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And set two doves on the table there.
5862,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5863,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And soft they cooed, and sweet they billed"
5864,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Like man and maid with love fulfilled.
5865,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5866,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Therewith the Maiden reached a hand
5867,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,To a dish that on the board did stand;
5868,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5869,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And she crumbled a share of the spice-loaf brown,"
5870,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And the Swain upon her hand looked down;
5871,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5872,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Then unto the fowl his eyes he turned;
5873,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And as in a dream his bowels yearned
5874,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5875,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,For somewhat that he could not name;
5876,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And into his heart a hope there came.
5877,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5878,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And still he looked on the hands of the Maid,"
5879,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,As before the fowl the crumbs she laid.
5880,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5881,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And he murmured low, ""O Goldilocks!"
5882,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Were we but amid the wheaten shocks!"""
5883,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5884,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Then the false Queen knit her brows and laid
5885,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,A fair white hand by the hand of the Maid.
5886,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5887,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"He turned his eyes away thereat,"
5888,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And closer to the Maiden sat.
5889,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5890,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,* * * * *
5891,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5892,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,But the queen-bird now the carle-bird fed
5893,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Till all was gone of the sugared bread.
5894,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5895,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Then with wheedling voice for more he craved,"
5896,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And the Maid a share from the spice-loaf shaved;
5897,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5898,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And the crumbs within her hollow hand
5899,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,She held where the creeping doves did stand.
5900,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5901,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"But Goldilocks, he looked and longed,"
5902,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And saw how the carle the queen-bird wronged.
5903,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5904,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,For when she came to the hand to eat
5905,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,The hungry queen-bird thence he beat.
5906,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5907,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Then Goldilocks the Swain spake low:
5908,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""Foul fall thee, bird, thou doest now"
5909,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5910,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"As I to Goldilocks, my sweet,"
5911,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Who gave my hungry mouth to eat."""
5912,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5913,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"He felt her hand as he did speak,"
5914,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,He felt her face against his cheek.
5915,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5916,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"He turned and stood in the evil hall,"
5917,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And swept her up in arms withal.
5918,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5919,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Then was there hubbub wild and strange,"
5920,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And swiftly all things there 'gan change.
5921,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5922,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"The fair Queen into a troll was grown,"
5923,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"A one-eyed, bow-backed, haggard crone."
5924,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5925,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And though the hall was yet full fair,"
5926,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And bright the sunshine streamed in there,"
5927,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5928,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,On evil shapes it fell forsooth:
5929,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Swine-heads; small red eyes void of ruth;
5930,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5931,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And bare-boned bodies of vile things,"
5932,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And evil-feathered bat-felled wings.
5933,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5934,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And all these mopped and mowed and grinned,"
5935,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And sent strange noises down the wind.
5936,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5937,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,There stood those twain unchanged alone
5938,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,To face the horror of the crone;
5939,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5940,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,She crouched against them by the board;
5941,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And cried the Maid: ""Thy sword, thy sword!"
5942,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5943,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Thy sword, O Goldilocks!  For see"
5944,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"She will not keep her oath to me."""
5945,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5946,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Out flashed the blade therewith.  He saw
5947,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"The foul thing sidelong toward them draw,"
5948,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5949,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Holding within her hand a cup
5950,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Wherein some dreadful drink seethed up.
5951,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5952,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Then Goldilocks cried out and smote,"
5953,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And the sharp blade sheared the evil throat.
5954,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5955,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,The head fell noseling to the floor;
5956,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"The liquor from the cup did pour,"
5957,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5958,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And ran along a sparkling flame
5959,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,That nigh unto their footsoles came.
5960,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5961,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Then empty straightway was the hall,"
5962,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Save for those twain, and she withal."
5963,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5964,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"So fled away the Maid and Man,"
5965,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And down the stony stairway ran.
5966,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5967,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,* * * * *
5968,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5969,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Fast fled they o'er the sunny grass
5970,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Yet but a little way did pass
5971,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5972,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Ere cried the Maid: ""Now cometh forth"
5973,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,The snow-white ice-bear of the North;
5974,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5975,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Turn Goldilocks, and heave up sword!"""
5976,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Then fast he stood upon the sward,"
5977,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5978,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And faced the beast, that whined and cried,"
5979,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And shook his head from side to side.
5980,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5981,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"But round him the Swain danced and leaped,"
5982,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And soon the grisly head he reaped.
5983,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5984,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And then the ancient blade he sheathed,"
5985,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And ran unto his love sweet-breathed;
5986,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5987,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And caught her in his arms and ran
5988,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Fast from that house, the bane of man."
5989,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5990,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,* * * * *
5991,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5992,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Yet therewithal he spake her soft
5993,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And kissed her over oft and oft,"
5994,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5995,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Until from kissed and trembling mouth
5996,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"She cried: ""The Dragon of the South!"""
5997,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
5998,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"He set her down and turned about,"
5999,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And drew the eager edges out.
6000,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6001,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And therewith scaly coil on coil
6002,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Reared 'gainst his face the mouth aboil:
6003,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6004,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,The gaping jaw and teeth of dread
6005,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Was dark 'twixt heaven and his head.
6006,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6007,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"But with no fear, no thought, no word,"
6008,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,He thrust the thin-edged ancient sword.
6009,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6010,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And the hot blood ran from the hairy throat,"
6011,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And set the summer grass afloat.
6012,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6013,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Then back he turned and caught her hand,"
6014,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And never a minute did they stand.
6015,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6016,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"But as they ran on toward the wood,"
6017,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,He deemed her swift feet fair and good.
6018,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6019,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,* * * * *
6020,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6021,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,She looked back o'er her shoulder fair:
6022,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""The whelming poison-pool is here;"
6023,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6024,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And now availeth nought the blade:
6025,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,O if my cherished trees might aid!
6026,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6027,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,But now my feet fail.  Leave me then!
6028,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And hold my memory dear of men."""
6029,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6030,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,He caught her in his arms again;
6031,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Of her dear side was he full fain.
6032,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6033,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Her body in his arms was dear:
6034,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""Sweet art thou, though we perish here!"""
6035,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6036,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Like quicksilver came on the flood:
6037,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"But lo, the borders of the wood!"
6038,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6039,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,She slid from out his arms and stayed;
6040,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Round a great oak her arms she laid.
6041,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6042,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""If e'er I saved thee, lovely tree,"
6043,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"From axe and saw, now, succour me:"
6044,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6045,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Look how the venom creeps anigh,"
6046,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Help! lest thou see me writhe and die."""
6047,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6048,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"She crouched beside the upheaved root,"
6049,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,The bubbling venom touched her foot;
6050,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6051,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Then with a sucking gasping sound
6052,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,It ebbed back o'er the blighted ground.
6053,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6054,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,* * * * *
6055,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6056,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Up then she rose and took his hand
6057,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And never a moment did they stand.
6058,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6059,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""Come, love,"" she cried, ""the ways I know,"
6060,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,How thick soe'er the thickets grow.
6061,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6062,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"O love, I love thee!  O thine heart!"
6063,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"How mighty and how kind thou art!"""
6064,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6065,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Therewith they saw the tree-dusk lit,"
6066,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Bright grey the great boles gleamed on it.
6067,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6068,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""O flee,"" she said, ""the sword is nought"
6069,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Against the flickering fire-flaught."""
6070,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6071,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""But this availeth yet,"" said he,"
6072,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""That Hallows All our love may see."""
6073,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6074,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,He turned about and faced the glare:
6075,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""O Mother, help us, kind and fair!"
6076,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6077,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Now help me, true St. Nicholas,"
6078,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"If ever truly thine I was!"""
6079,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6080,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Therewith the wild-fire waned and paled
6081,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And in the wood the light nigh failed;
6082,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6083,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And all about 'twas as the night.
6084,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"He said: ""Now won is all our fight,"
6085,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6086,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And now meseems all were but good
6087,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"If thou mightst bring us from the wood."""
6088,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6089,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"She fawned upon him, face and breast;"
6090,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"She said: ""It hangs 'twixt worst and best."
6091,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6092,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And yet, O love, if thou be true,"
6093,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"One thing alone thou hast to do."""
6094,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6095,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Sweetly he kissed her, cheek and chin:"
6096,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""What work thou biddest will I win."""
6097,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6098,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""O love, my love, I needs must sleep;"
6099,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Wilt thou my slumbering body keep,"
6100,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6101,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And, toiling sorely, still bear on"
6102,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"The love thou seemest to have won?"""
6103,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6104,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""O easy toil,"" he said, ""to bless"
6105,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Mine arms with all thy loveliness."""
6106,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6107,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"She smiled; ""Yea, easy it may seem,"
6108,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,But harder is it than ye deem.
6109,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6110,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"For hearken!  Whatso thou mayst see,"
6111,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Piteous as it may seem to thee,"
6112,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6113,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Heed not nor hearken! bear me forth,"
6114,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"As though nought else were aught of worth,"
6115,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6116,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,For all earth's wealth that may be found
6117,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Lay me not sleeping on the ground,"
6118,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6119,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"To help, to hinder, or to save!"
6120,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Or there for me thou diggest a grave."""
6121,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6122,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,* * * * *
6123,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6124,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"He took her body on his arm,"
6125,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Her slumbering head lay on his barm.
6126,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6127,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Then glad he bore her on the way,"
6128,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And the wood grew lighter with the day.
6129,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6130,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"All still it was, till suddenly"
6131,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,He heard a bitter wail near by.
6132,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6133,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Yet on he went until he heard
6134,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,The cry become a shapen word:
6135,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6136,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""Help me, O help, thou passer by!"
6137,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Turn from the path, let me not die!"
6138,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6139,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,I am a woman; bound and left
6140,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"To perish; of all help bereft."""
6141,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6142,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Then died the voice out in a moan;
6143,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"He looked upon his love, his own,"
6144,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6145,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And minding all she spake to him
6146,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Strode onward through the wild-wood dim.
6147,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6148,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,* * * * *
6149,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6150,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,But lighter grew the woodland green
6151,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Till clear the shapes of things were seen.
6152,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6153,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And therewith wild halloos he heard,"
6154,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And shrieks, and cries of one afeard."
6155,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6156,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Nigher it grew and yet more nigh
6157,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Till burst from out a brake near by
6158,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6159,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"A woman bare of breast and limb,"
6160,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Who turned a piteous face to him
6161,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6162,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,E'en as she ran: for hard at heel
6163,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Followed a man with brandished steel,"
6164,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6165,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And yelling mouth.  Then the swain stood
6166,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,One moment in the glimmering wood
6167,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6168,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Trembling, ashamed: Yet now grown wise"
6169,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Deemed all a snare for ears and eyes.
6170,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6171,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,So onward swiftlier still he strode
6172,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And cast all thought on his fair load.
6173,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6174,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And yet in but a little space
6175,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Back came the yelling shrieking chase,"
6176,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6177,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And well-nigh gripped now by the man,"
6178,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Straight unto him the woman ran;
6179,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6180,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And underneath the gleaming steel
6181,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,E'en at his very feet did kneel.
6182,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6183,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"She looked up; sobs were all her speech,"
6184,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Yet sorely did her face beseech.
6185,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6186,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"While o'er her head the chaser stared,"
6187,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Shaking aloft the edges bared.
6188,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6189,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Doubted the swain, and a while did stand"
6190,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,As she took his coat-lap in her hand.
6191,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6192,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Upon his hand he felt her breath
6193,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Hot with the dread of present death.
6194,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6195,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Sleek was her arm on his scarlet coat,"
6196,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,The sobbing passion rose in his throat.
6197,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6198,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,But e'en therewith he looked aside
6199,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And saw the face of the sleeping bride.
6200,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6201,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Then he tore his coat from the woman's hand,"
6202,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And never a moment there did stand.
6203,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6204,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,But swiftly thence away he strode
6205,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Along the dusky forest road.
6206,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6207,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And there rose behind him laughter shrill,"
6208,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And then was the windless wood all still,"
6209,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6210,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"He looked around o'er all the place,"
6211,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,But saw no image of the chase.
6212,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6213,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And as he looked the night-mirk now
6214,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,O'er all the tangled wood 'gan flow.
6215,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6216,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Then stirred the sweetling that he bore,"
6217,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And she slid adown from his arms once more.
6218,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6219,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Nought might he see her well-loved face;
6220,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,But he felt her lips in the mirky place.
6221,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6222,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""'Tis night,"" she said, ""and the false day's gone,"
6223,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And we twain in the wild-wood all alone.
6224,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6225,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Night o'er the earth; so rest we here
6226,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Until to-morrow's sun is clear.
6227,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6228,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,For overcome is every foe
6229,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And home to-morrow shall we go."""
6230,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6231,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"So 'neath the trees they lay, those twain,"
6232,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And to them the darksome night was gain.
6233,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6234,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,But when the morrow's dawn was grey
6235,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,They woke and kissed whereas they lay.
6236,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6237,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And when on their feet they came to stand
6238,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Swain Goldilocks stretched out his hand.
6239,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6240,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"And he spake: ""O love, my love indeed,"
6241,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Where now is gone thy goodly weed?
6242,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6243,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"For again thy naked feet I see,"
6244,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And thy sweet sleek arms so kind to me.
6245,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6246,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Through thy rent kirtle once again
6247,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Thy shining shoulder showeth plain."""
6248,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6249,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,She blushed as red as the sun-sweet rose:
6250,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"""My garments gay were e'en of those"
6251,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6252,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,That the false Queen dight to slay my heart;
6253,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,And sore indeed was their fleshly smart.
6254,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
6255,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,"Yet must I bear them, well-beloved,"
6256,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,Until thy truth and troth was proved.
6257,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS.,
