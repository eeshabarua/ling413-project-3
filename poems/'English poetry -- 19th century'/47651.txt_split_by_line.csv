436,LAODAMIA,"Her bosom heaves and spreads, her stature grows;"

625,LAODAMIA,
626,LAODAMIA,"After meeting the Wordsworths at Charles Lamb's, on the 9th May 1815,"
627,LAODAMIA,"Henry Crabb Robinson wrote in his _Diary_: ""It is the mere power which"
628,LAODAMIA,"he is conscious of exerting in which he delights, not the production of"
629,LAODAMIA,a work in which men rejoice on account of the sympathies and
630,LAODAMIA,"sensibilities it excites in them. Hence, he does not much esteem his"
631,LAODAMIA,"_Laodamia_, as it belongs to the inferior class of poems founded on the"
632,LAODAMIA,"affections."" (See _Diary, Reminiscences, and Correspondence_, vol."
633,LAODAMIA,i. p. 482.)
634,LAODAMIA,
635,LAODAMIA,"Wordsworth wrote thus to Walter Savage Landor, from Rydal Mount, on the"
636,LAODAMIA,21st of January 1824:--
637,LAODAMIA,
638,LAODAMIA,"""You have condescended to minute criticism upon the _Laodamia_.[D]"
639,LAODAMIA,"I concur with you in the first stanza, and had several times"
640,LAODAMIA,"attempted to alter it upon your grounds. I cannot, however, accede"
641,LAODAMIA,"to your objection to the 'second birth,' merely because the"
642,LAODAMIA,expression has been degraded by Conventiclers.[E] I certainly meant
643,LAODAMIA,"nothing more by it than the _eadem cura_, and the _largior Ã¦ther_,"
644,LAODAMIA,"etc., of Virgil's Sixth _Ãneid_. All religions owe their origin or"
645,LAODAMIA,acceptation to the wish of the human heart to supply in another
646,LAODAMIA,"state of existence the deficiencies of this, and to carry still"
647,LAODAMIA,"nearer to perfection what we admire in our present condition, so"
648,LAODAMIA,that there must be many modes of expression arising out of this
649,LAODAMIA,"coincidence, or rather identity of feeling common to all"
650,LAODAMIA,Mythologies; and under this observation I should shelter the phrase
651,LAODAMIA,"from your censure--but I may be wrong in the particular case,"
652,LAODAMIA,though certainly not in the general principle. This leads to a
653,LAODAMIA,remark in your last--'that you are disgusted with all books that
654,LAODAMIA,"treat of religion.' I am afraid it is a bad sign in me, that I have"
655,LAODAMIA,little relish for any other. Even in poetry it is the imaginative
656,LAODAMIA,"only, viz., that which is conversant with or turns upon Infinity,"
657,LAODAMIA,that powerfully affects me. Perhaps I ought to explain: I mean to
658,LAODAMIA,"say that except in those passages, where things are lost in each"
659,LAODAMIA,"other, and limits vanish, and aspirations are raised, I read with"
660,LAODAMIA,something too like indifference; but all great Poets are in this
661,LAODAMIA,"view powerful Religionists."""
662,LAODAMIA,
663,LAODAMIA,"In 1815 Charles Lamb wrote to Wordsworth, ""_Laodamia_ is a very original"
664,LAODAMIA,poem; I mean original with reference to your own manner. You have
665,LAODAMIA,"nothing like it. I should have seen it in a strange place, and greatly"
666,LAODAMIA,"admired it, but not suspected its derivation."" (_The Letters of Charles"
667,LAODAMIA,"Lamb_, edited by Alfred Ainger, vol. i. p. 284.)"
668,LAODAMIA,
669,LAODAMIA,"Mr. Hazlitt wrote of _Laodamia_: ""It breathes the pure spirit of the"
670,LAODAMIA,"finest fragments of antiquity--the sweetness, the gravity, the strength,"
671,LAODAMIA,"the beauty, and the languor of Death. Its glossy brilliancy arises from"
672,LAODAMIA,"the perfection of the finishing, like that of careful sculpture, not"
673,LAODAMIA,from gaudy colouring--the texture of the thoughts has the smoothness and
674,LAODAMIA,"solidity of marble. It is a poem that might be read aloud in Elysium,"
675,LAODAMIA,and the spirits of departed heroes and sages would gather round to
676,LAODAMIA,"listen to it."""
677,LAODAMIA,
678,LAODAMIA,"I am indebted to the Headmaster of Fettes College, Edinburgh, the Rev."
679,LAODAMIA,"W. A. Heard, for the following illustrative notes on _Laodamia_:--"
680,LAODAMIA,
681,LAODAMIA,"""This poem illustrates more completely than any other the sympathy"
682,LAODAMIA,of the poet with the spirit of antiquity in its purest and most
683,LAODAMIA,exalted forms. The idea that underlies the poem is the same
684,LAODAMIA,"conception of 'pietas' which Virgil has embodied in the _Ãneid_,"
685,LAODAMIA,"and with which he has associated, especially in the sixth book,"
686,LAODAMIA,"which Wordsworth in many passages recalls, great ethical and"
687,LAODAMIA,"religious conceptions, derived in the main from the philosophy of"
688,LAODAMIA,Plato. 'Pietas' embraces all the duties of life that are based upon
689,LAODAMIA,"the affections--love of home and parents and children, love of the"
690,LAODAMIA,"Gods of our Fathers, and a reverence for that great order of things"
691,LAODAMIA,in which man finds himself a part. The pious man believes in a
692,LAODAMIA,"destiny, or order transcending his own will: to exalt any passion,"
693,LAODAMIA,"however innocent, above this, is a rebellion; to intensify any"
694,LAODAMIA,"passion, so as to disturb the appropriate calm of resignation, is"
695,LAODAMIA,to act irreverently against the gods. Lesser duties must give way
696,LAODAMIA,"to greater: love of wife must give way to love of country, and the"
697,LAODAMIA,sorrow of bereavement must not obscure the larger issues of life.
698,LAODAMIA,"Thus, not only did Laodamia's yearning for the restoration of her"
699,LAODAMIA,husband to life show a failure to recognise the fixity of eternal
700,LAODAMIA,"laws, but her death was 'á½Ïá½²Ï Î¼á½¹ÏÎ¿Î½' and in reason's"
701,LAODAMIA,"spite; it was, after all, self-will, and could not win the favour"
702,LAODAMIA,of heaven.
703,LAODAMIA,
704,LAODAMIA,"Blending with this notion of 'pietas,' we find the Platonic"
705,LAODAMIA,repudiation of sensuous and material life. This life is only a
706,LAODAMIA,"discipline under imperfect conditions, and to be set free from the"
707,LAODAMIA,passion and fretfulness of existence is the choice and longing of
708,LAODAMIA,the wise.
709,LAODAMIA,
710,LAODAMIA,"The poem is thus notable, not so much for the assimilation of"
711,LAODAMIA,"details, as for natural affinity to the spirituality of antiquity,"
712,LAODAMIA,"of which Virgil is the purest exponent. Virgil's seriousness, his"
713,LAODAMIA,"tenderness, his conception of the inevitable, and yet moral, order"
714,LAODAMIA,"of the world, his desire for purification, his sadness, and yet"
715,LAODAMIA,"complete freedom from unmanliness, his love of nature and belief in"
716,LAODAMIA,the sympathy of nature with man--all these are points of contact
717,LAODAMIA,between the ancient and modern poet.

1277,X,"Wordsworth visited the same spot alluded to in the Fenwick note,"
1278,X,"accompanied by his sister, who thus describes it: ""The most remarkable"
1279,X,"object we saw was a huge single stone, I believe three or four times the"
1280,X,"size of Bowder Stone. The top of it, which on one side was sloping like"
1281,X,"the roof of a house, was covered with heather.... The ferryman told us"
1282,X,that a preaching was held there once in three months by a certain
1283,X,"minister--I think of Arrochar--who engages, as a part of his office, to"
1284,X,perform the service. The interesting feelings we had connected with the
1285,X,Highland Sabbath and Highland worship returned here with double force.
1286,X,"The rock, though on one side a high perpendicular wall, in no place"
1287,X,"overhung so as to form a shelter, in no place could it be more than a"
1288,X,screen from the elements. Why then had it been selected for such a
1289,X,purpose? Was it merely from being a central situation and a conspicuous
1290,X,object? Or did there belong to it some inheritance of superstition from
1291,X,"old times? It is impossible to look at the stone without asking, How"
1292,X,"came it hither? Had then that obscurity and unaccountableness, that"
1293,X,"mystery of power which is about it, any influence over the first persons"
1294,X,who resorted hither for worship? Or have they now on those who continue
1295,X,"to frequent it? The lake is in front of the perpendicular wall, and"
1296,X,"behind, at some distance, and totally detached from it, is the"
1297,X,continuation of the ridge of mountain which forms the Vale of Loch
1298,X,"Lomond--a magnificent temple, of which this spot is a noble Sanctum"
1299,X,"Sanctorum."" (_Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland, A.D. 1803_, pp."
1300,X,225-6.) The late Rev. William Macintosh of Buchanan supplied me with the
1301,X,following information in reference to the Brownie's Cell and the Pulpit
1302,X,"Rock:--""I have little doubt that the Brownie's Cell is the name given by"
1303,X,"Wordsworth to a small vault, itself a ruin among the ruins of an old"
1304,X,"stronghold of the Macfarlanes in Eilan Vhow, an islet about three miles"
1305,X,from the head of the Loch. The name of the islet is spelt in different
1306,X,"ways; sometimes as I have given it, sometimes Eilan Vow, or Eilan-a"
1307,X,Vhu; no one whom I consulted could tell me the right spelling. In the
1308,X,"early part of this century, the vault was the headquarters of a pedlar"
1309,X,of the name of Macfarlane. He may have been the Hermit; and there is a
1310,X,"story of his having been frightened by the sudden apparition of a negro,"
1311,X,"(probably the first he had ever seen), who had been ordered by his"
1312,X,master--an English officer--to swim across for that purpose: and it is
1313,X,said that he never again visited the cell.
1314,X,
1315,X,"The Pulpit Rock, also called by a Gaelic name meaning the Bull Stone, is"
1316,X,"a very large boulder, or detached rock, which is likely to 'stand' as"
1317,X,"long as Ben Lomond. In the face of it, there is an artificial doorway"
1318,X,"and recess, which at one time the Parish Minister used to occupy as a"
1319,X,Pulpit for occasional services. The audience sat on turf seats ranged
1320,X,round the foot of the Rock. The pulpit was reached by a few steps cut
1321,X,"out, I suppose, in the Rock: but it has never been used for the last"
1322,X,twenty years. The 'occasional' services are now held in a neighbouring
1323,X,"schoolroom."""
1324,X,
1325,X,"Mr. Malcolm M'Farlane, a very intelligent sheep farmer in Buchanan"
1326,X,"parish, supplies the following additional information about the Cell and"
1327,X,"the Rock:--""The 'Pulpit Rock' is a cell in the face of a large stone,"
1328,X,"blasted out with gunpowder. The proper appellation is, in Gaelic,"
1329,X,"'Clach-nan-Tairbh,' literally translated the 'Stone of the Bulls.' It"
1330,X,"was formed about 50 or 60 years ago, the then minister of Arrochar, Mr."
1331,X,"Proudfoot, had promised to preach in that part of his parish, on several"
1332,X,"occasions during the year, provided they would get up a place for his"
1333,X,"reception.... It was capable of containing three or four persons inside,"
1334,X,"was done up with wood work, an outer and inner door, with stone steps"
1335,X,"leading to the recess. They were not formed out of the rock, but other"
1336,X,"stones got up for the purpose, and turf seats laid out for the hearers,"
1337,X,"who were all exposed to the weather, except so far as they might be"
1338,X,sheltered by the rock. The service has been discontinued at the rock for
1339,X,"about twenty-five years, and is now held at a schoolhouse. The doors are"
1340,X,"gone, and no portion of the wood work remains. The cell is now used only"
1341,X,"as a nightly retreat for mendicants, tinkers,"" etc. Wordsworth's"
1342,X,"reference, in the Fenwick note, to Burns's _Holy Fair_ induces me to"
1343,X,"quote what follows in Mr. M'Farlane's letter:--""Open air preaching was"
1344,X,"then very general in the Highlands: the people came long distances,"
1345,X,"travelled over hills, even in inclement weather, to attend them. An"
1346,X,"individual who kept a small inn, on the loch side opposite Inversnaid,"
1347,X,used regularly to attend the meetings with a supply of whisky; but he
1348,X,"remained behind the 'rock' till the services were over, when the people"
1349,X,"partook of his refreshments. Also, on the north side of Loch Katrine,"
1350,X,"the minister of Callander used to conduct services in the open air, on"
1351,X,"several occasions during the year, in that distant part of his parish."
1352,X,"An old man, who lived near the Trossachs, whom I remember very well,"
1353,X,"regularly attended with a supply of whisky. Dr. Robertson, who was then"
1354,X,"minister, after concluding the sermon, had gone to an adjoining farm"
1355,X,"house. The people had indulged too freely, so that a fight commenced"
1356,X,(the same thing had happened on several occasions before). The Doctor
1357,X,"had to leave his dinner in order to get them separated, and to put an"
1358,X,"end to the battle, but he never allowed any more whisky to be brought to"
1359,X,"the place afterwards.... These may be irrelevant matters, but they might"
1360,X,"illustrate a chapter in Lecky's _History of Morals_, as there is more"
1361,X,"decorum now observed. Since writing the above, I have thought that if"
1362,X,"the pulpit-rock is mentioned in Miss Wordsworth's Tour, Mr. M'Nicol, my"
1363,X,"informant, must have made a mistake in stating the time it was made, as"
1364,X,about 50 or 60 years ago; but it cannot have been much more than 80
1365,X,"years, as it is not very long since some of the people who were engaged"
1366,X,in the operation died.
1367,X,
1368,X,"""Regarding the island near the head of Loch Lomond which is termed"
1369,X,"'Eilan (Island) Vow' in Black's _Guide_, and somewhat differently spelt"
1370,X,"in others, in the original Gaelic it is 'Eilan a BhÅ«th.' BÅ«th is a"
1371,X,"Gaelic name for a shop, so that it is 'the island of the shop.' The"
1372,X,"English Vow has no connection whatever with the Gaelic, and is perfectly"
1373,X,unintelligible. It is part of undoubted traditional history that the
1374,X,"chiefs of the Clan M'Farlane, who owned a considerable portion of the"
1375,X,"adjoining lands, had their residence here. In these turbulent times"
1376,X,"islands were considered more secure, as surrounded with water. They kept"
1377,X,"a 'shop' in the island, from which they supplied the little wants of the"
1378,X,"surrounding population, so that it is perfectly clear how the Island"
1379,X,derived its name. A good portion of the stronghold is still in good
1380,X,preservation. A part of the wall is about thirty feet high. It is a very
1381,X,old building. Mr. M'Nicol states that he had learned from his
1382,X,"grandfather, by the tradition in the family, that it was erected between"
1383,X,"the eleventh and the twelfth century. The late Sir James Colquhoun,"
1384,X,"about twelve years ago, laid out some money for keeping the walls in"
1385,X,"preservation. At the bottom of the Fort, and below the level of the"
1386,X,"floor, is the 'Brownie's Cell,' several steps leading down to it, and it"
1387,X,"is partly underground. It is about twelve feet wide, and sixteen feet"
1388,X,"long, with an arched roof, the mason work being still in good repair."
1389,X,There is some glimmering light emitted by two small apertures formed in
1390,X,the walls at each end. I have been unable to obtain any specific
1391,X,information what purpose it served in connection with the other
1392,X,"building. Some said that it must have been a prison, and others a store"
1393,X,"for the shop. It might have been a prison at first, and afterwards, in"
1394,X,"more pacific times, used as a store."
1395,X,
1396,X,"""About the beginning of this century, the Island was occupied by a very"
1397,X,"eccentric individual, who led the life of a hermit, and took up his"
1398,X,"abode in this recess. He made frequent excursions out of it, but always"
1399,X,returned to his Island-home before the end of the week. It was not then
1400,X,"planted with wood, so that he cultivated a part of the ground, raised"
1401,X,"some crops, kept some poultry. He trained the poultry to fly on the"
1402,X,"approach of any stranger, so that they could not be got hold of, or"
1403,X,"taken away in his absence from the Island. He also kept a curious diary,"
1404,X,"in which local events, his own doings and opinions, were recorded in"
1405,X,"great detail, expressed in very quaint language. It was by the age of"
1406,X,"the moon, and not by the days of the month, that events were entered in"
1407,X,"the diary. He also cultivated astrology, and believed in the evil"
1408,X,influence of some of the stars. He had a firm belief in ghosts; but he
1409,X,"never was so frightened as when the Black Man (that is the negro), who"
1410,X,"he thought belonged to the invisible world, swam to the island. Of that"
1411,X,"adventure I have not been able to obtain a more detailed account, but"
1412,X,his landing there very nearly put him out of his wits. The grandfather
1413,X,"of the present Duke of Montrose had, on one occasion, visited the"
1414,X,"Island; and, when landing, the Hermit addressed him, 'James Graham, the"
1415,X,"Duke of Montrose, you are welcome to come and see my Island.'..."""
1416,X,
1417,X,"There is no evidence that the ruin was once ""a consecrated Pile,"" as"
1418,X,stated in the poem. Wordsworth had evidently heard of the Hermit's
1419,X,"writings, as mentioned by Mr. M'Farlane. See stanza vi., ""guiding a pen"
1420,X,"unwearied."""
1421,X,
1422,X,"In the _Diary, Reminiscences, and Correspondence_ of Henry Crabb"
1423,X,"Robinson, there is an entry, dated January 2, 1820:--""Went to Lamb's,"
1424,X,where I found Mr. and Mrs. Wordsworth.... Not much was said about his
1425,X,(W.'s) new volume of Poems. He himself spoke of _The Brownie's Cell_ as
1426,X,"his favourite"" (vol. ii. p. 162). In the following year Mr. Crabb"
1427,X,"Robinson himself visited Scotland, and wrote thus on the 16th"
1428,X,"September:--""Being on the western side of Loch Lomond, opposite the Mill"
1429,X,"at Inversnaid, some women kindled a fire, the smoke of which was to be a"
1430,X,signal for a ferryboat. No ferryman came; and a feeble old man offering
1431,X,"himself as a boatman, I intrusted myself to him. I asked the women who"
1432,X,"he was. They said, 'That's old Andrew.' According to their account he"
1433,X,lived a hermit's life in a lone island on the lake; the poor peasantry
1434,X,"giving him meal, and what he wanted, and he picking up pence. On my"
1435,X,"asking him whether he would take me across the lake, he said, 'I wull,"
1436,X,if you'll gi'e me saxpence.' So I consented. But before I was half over
1437,X,"I repented of my rashness, for I feared the oars would fall out of his"
1438,X,hands. A breath of wind would have rendered half the voyage too much for
1439,X,him. There was some cunning mixed up with the fellow's seeming
1440,X,"imbecility, for when his strength was failing he rested, and entered"
1441,X,"into talk, manifestly to amuse me. He said he could see things before"
1442,X,"they happened. He saw the Radicals before they came, etc. He had picked"
1443,X,"up a few words of Spanish and German, which he uttered ridiculously, and"
1444,X,laughed. But when I put troublesome questions he affected not to
1445,X,"understand me; and was quite astonished, as well as delighted, when I"
1446,X,gave him two sixpences instead of the one he had bargained for. The
1447,X,"simple-minded women, who affected to look down on him, seemed, however,"
1448,X,"to stand in awe of him, and no wonder. On my telling Wordsworth this"
1449,X,"history, he exclaimed, 'That's my ""Brownie!""' His _Brownie's Cell_ is by"
1450,X,no means one of my favourite poems. My sight of old Andrew showed me the
1451,X,"stuff out of which a poetical mind can weave such a web"" (vol. ii. pp."
1452,X,"212, 213)."

4299,X,"Replying to some criticism on this _Ode_ by Southey, Wordsworth wrote to"
4300,X,"his friend as follows:--""I am much of your mind in respect to my Ode."
4301,X,"Had it been a hymn, uttering the sentiments of a _multitude_, a _stanza_"
4302,X,would have been indispensable. But though I have called it a
4303,X,"'Thanksgiving Ode,' strictly speaking it is not so, but a poem,"
4304,X,"composed, or supposed to be composed, on the morning of the"
4305,X,"thanksgiving, uttering the sentiments of an _individual_ upon that"
4306,X,"occasion. It is a _dramatised ejaculation_; and this, if anything can,"
4307,X,must excuse the irregular frame of the metre. In respect to a _stanza_
4308,X,"for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively, there are"
4309,X,"great objections. If the stanza be short, it will scarcely allow of"
4310,X,"fervour and importunity, unless so short, as that the sense is run"
4311,X,"perpetually from one stanza to another, as in Horace's Alcaics; and if"
4312,X,"it be long, it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as to check it. Of"
4313,X,this we have innumerable instances in Spenser and the Italian poets. The
4314,X,"sense required cannot be included in one given stanza, so that another"
4315,X,"whole stanza is added, not infrequently, for the sake of matter which"
4316,X,would naturally include itself in a very few lines.

5004,I,"On the tired household of corporeal sense,"
5005,I,"And Fancy, keeping unreluctant watch,"
5006,I,Was free her choicest favours to dispense;[131]

5008,I,A landscape more august than happiest skill[132]
5009,I,Of pencil ever clothed with light and shade;
5010,I,"An intermingled pomp of vale and hill,"
5011,I,"City, and naval stream, suburban grove,[133]"
5012,I,And stately forest where the wild deer rove;                  10
5013,I,"Nor wanted lurking hamlet, dusky towns,"
5014,I,And scattered rural farms of aspect bright;
5015,I,"And, here and there, between the pastoral downs,"

5022,I,"Brighter than brightest loop-hole, in a storm,                20"
5023,I,Opening before the sun's triumphant eye--
5024,I,"Issued, to sudden view, a glorious Form![134]"

5514,V,The date of the composition of this Ode is uncertain. Wordsworth himself
5515,V,"gives no clue: but it seems to refer to the rise of the French Republic,"
5516,V,with its illusive promises of Liberty: the freedom of the many being
5517,V,"sacrificed to the despotism of one. The Republic passed ""through many a"
5518,V,"change of form."" It became both tyrannous and aggressive. The"
5519,V,"""Principalities"" of Europe ""melted"" before it. It stood forth ""an armÃ¨d"

5523,V,"How long shall vengeance sleep? Ye patient Heavens, how long?"

5525,V,The allusions in stanza iv. suggest that this Ode was written before
5526,V,"Waterloo, and the final overthrow of the power of Napoleon, but it is"
5527,V,"difficult, if not impossible, to determine the point with exactness from"
5528,V,internal evidence.
5529,V,
5530,V,The reference in the last stanza may be to the legend of Amphion moving
5531,V,"stones, and building up the walls of Thebes, by the sound of his lyre;"
5532,V,"the stones advancing to their places, and being fitted together, as he"
5533,V,played his instrument. Compare Tennyson's _Amphion_.--ED.

6320,VI,"Some years ago I was inclined to assign this poem to the year 1814,"
6321,VI,because Wordsworth himself gave it that date in one of the notes which
6322,VI,he dictated to Miss Fenwick in 1843. I now assign it to the year 1816.
6323,VI,"Wordsworth gave it that date in the year 1837, and if written in 1814,"
6324,VI,I think it would have been included in the edition of 1815.
6325,VI,
6326,VI,"_Dion_, the _Ode to Lycoris_, and the translation of part of Virgil's"
6327,VI,"_Ãneid_, belong to a time when Wordsworth had reverted to the subjects"
6328,VI,of ancient classical literature while preparing his eldest son for the
6329,VI,University.
6330,VI,
6331,VI,"Charles Lamb wrote thus to Dorothy Wordsworth in 1820:--""The story of"
6332,VI,Dion is divine--the genius of Plato falling on him like moonlight--the
6333,VI,"finest thing ever expressed."" (_The Letters of Charles Lamb_, edited by"
6334,VI,"Alfred Ainger, vol. ii. p. 56.)"
6335,VI,
6336,VI,"I am indebted to the Headmaster of Fettes College, the Rev. W. A. Heard,"
6337,VI,"for the following notes on the poem, with special reference to Plutarch."
6338,VI,"They reveal, as Mr. Heard remarks, ""Wordsworth's method of work upon the"
6339,VI,"authors he had read and studied, and show upon what a solid structure of"
6340,VI,"fact he always wrote."" It will be observed that he invariably appended"
6341,VI,"to the title of this poem ""(See Plutarch)."""
6342,VI,
6343,VI,"""When Dion, the pupil of Plato, became the autocrat of Syracuse, it"
6344,VI,seemed as if the moment had come for the rule of a philosopher. But the
6345,VI,gardens of the Academy knew nothing of the methods by which alone
6346,VI,intrigue could be met and unscrupulousness baffled. The murder of
6347,VI,"Heracleides became a political necessity; but when this was conceded,"
6348,VI,the charm was once and for ever broken--the career was done. Plutarch's
6349,VI,"biography deals mainly with the external conditions, and is overlaid"
6350,VI,with so much historical detail that the personality of Dion stands out
6351,VI,in insufficient relief. Wordsworth gives us a study of the internal
6352,VI,"struggle, showing us the failure of an ideal, not in its external"
6353,VI,"aspect, but as closing the aspirations, and desolating the conscience,"
6354,VI,of a truly noble mind. He accepts Plutarch's general conception of the
6355,VI,"life, incorporating much of the details and adopting some of the"
6356,VI,"language, but over and above the fresh emphasis he gives to critical"
6357,VI,"moments, the imaginative insight with which all the detail is treated"
6358,VI,makes the poem an original presentation.

7179,II,Beneath the shadow of his purple wings
7180,II,Rested a golden harp;--he touched the strings;
7181,II,"And, after prelude of unearthly sound"
7182,II,"Poured through the echoing hills around,"
7183,II,He sang--
7184,II,"""No wintry desolations,                              25"

7190,II,Profound of night's ethereal blue;
7191,II,And in the aspect of each radiant orb:--
7192,II,"Some fixed, some wandering with no timid curb:"
7193,II,"But wandering star[226] and fixed, to mortal eye,"
7194,II,"Blended in absolute serenity,                                 35"
7195,II,And free from semblance of decline;--
7196,II,"Fresh as if Evening brought their natal hour,"
7197,II,"Her darkness splendour gave, her silence power,"

7286,V,High as the imperial front of man;
7287,V,The roseate bloom on woman's cheek;
7288,V,The soaring eagle's curvÃ¨d beak;                             120
7289,V,The white plumes of the floating swan;
7290,V,"Old as the tiger's paw, the lion's mane"

7300,V,Not undiversified though smooth and even;

7302,V,Bright Seraphs mixed familiarly with men;                    134

7311,V,In music--uttered surely without wrong
7312,V,(For 'twas thy work) though here the Listener lay
7313,V,Couch'd on green herbage 'mid the warmth of May

7315,V,Empow'r'd to wait for thy return
7316,V,Voice of the Heav'ns I will not mourn;
7317,V,Content that holy peace and mute remembrance dwell
7318,V,Within the bosom of the chorded shell
7319,V,"Tuned 'mid those seats of love and joy, concealed"
7320,V,"By day, by night imperfectly revealed;"
7321,V,Thy native mansions that endure

7329,V,"Some fix'd, some wandering, with no timid curb,"

7529,"MAY, 1817",[The discerning reader--who is aware that in the poem of _Ellen Irwin_ I
7530,"MAY, 1817","was desirous of throwing the reader at once out of the old ballad, so as"
7531,"MAY, 1817","if possible, to preclude a comparison between that mode of dealing with"
7532,"MAY, 1817",the subject and the mode I meant to adopt--may here perhaps perceive
7533,"MAY, 1817",that this poem originated in the four last lines of the first stanza.
7534,"MAY, 1817","Those specks of snow, reflected in the lake and so transferred, as it"
7535,"MAY, 1817","were, to the subaqueous sky, reminded me of the swans which the fancy of"
7536,"MAY, 1817",the ancient classic poets yoked to the car of Venus. Hence the tenor of
7537,"MAY, 1817","the whole first stanza, and the name of Lycoris, which--with some"
7538,"MAY, 1817",readers who think my theology and classical allusion too far fetched and
7539,"MAY, 1817",therefore more or less unnatural and affected--will tend to unrealise
7540,"MAY, 1817",the sentiment that pervades these verses. But surely one who has written
7541,"MAY, 1817",so much in verse as I have done may be allowed to retrace his steps in
7542,"MAY, 1817","the regions of fancy which delighted him in his boyhood, when he first"
7543,"MAY, 1817",became acquainted with the Greek and Roman poets. Before I read Virgil I
7544,"MAY, 1817","was so strongly attached to Ovid, whose _Metamorphoses_ I read at"
7545,"MAY, 1817","school, that I was quite in a passion whenever I found him, in books of"
7546,"MAY, 1817","criticism, placed below Virgil. As to Homer, I was never weary of"
7547,"MAY, 1817",travelling over the scenes through which he led me. Classical literature
7548,"MAY, 1817",affected me by its own beauty. But the truths of Scripture having been
7549,"MAY, 1817","entrusted to the dead languages, and these fountains having recently"
7550,"MAY, 1817","been laid open at the Reformation, an importance and a sanctity were at"
7551,"MAY, 1817","that period attached to classical literature that extended, as is"
7552,"MAY, 1817","obvious in Milton's _Lycidas_ for example, both to its spirit and form"
7553,"MAY, 1817",in a degree that can never be revived. No doubt the hacknied and
7554,"MAY, 1817",lifeless use into which mythology fell towards the close of the 17th
7555,"MAY, 1817","century, and which continued through the 18th, disgusted the general"
7556,"MAY, 1817","reader with all allusion to it in modern verse; and though, in deference"
7557,"MAY, 1817","to this disgust, and also in a measure participating in it, I abstained"
7558,"MAY, 1817","in my earlier writings from all introduction of pagan fable, surely,"
7559,"MAY, 1817","even in its humble form, it may ally itself with real sentiment, as I"

7775,TO THE SAME,"of this poem, warrants the suggestion that the ""Friend"" with whom he had"
7776,TO THE SAME,"""known such happy hours together"" was his own sister Dorothy. The"
7777,TO THE SAME,"extreme probability that it was on Nab Scar that the snow patches lay,"
7778,TO THE SAME,"which were reflected in Rydal mere, and which his imagination"
7779,TO THE SAME,"transformed into the swans that carried Venus' car through heaven, adds"
7780,TO THE SAME,to the likelihood of this conjecture. The following extracts from the
7781,TO THE SAME,"Sister's journal may be compared with passages in the poem:--""We pushed"
7782,TO THE SAME,"on to the foot of the Scar. It was very grand when we looked up, very"
7783,TO THE SAME,stony.... Coleridge went to search for something new. We saw him
7784,TO THE SAME,"climbing up towards a rock. He called us, and we found him in a"
7785,TO THE SAME,"bower,--the sweetest that was ever seen. The rock on one side is very"
7786,TO THE SAME,"high, and all covered with ivy, which hung loosely about, and bore"
7787,TO THE SAME,"bunches of brown berries."" With this compare--"
7788,TO THE SAME,
7789,TO THE SAME,"Yon wild cave, whose jaggÃ¨d brows are fringed"
7790,TO THE SAME,"With flaccid threads of ivy, in the still"
7791,TO THE SAME,"And sultry air, depending motionless."
7792,TO THE SAME,
7793,TO THE SAME,"And with the following, ""We looked down on the Ambleside vale, that"
7794,TO THE SAME,"seemed to wind away from us, the village lying under the hill,"""
7795,TO THE SAME,compare--
7796,TO THE SAME,

7798,TO THE SAME,"Each weary step, dwarfing the world below."
7799,TO THE SAME,
7800,TO THE SAME,"With the following, ""It is scarce a bower, a little parlour only, not"
7801,TO THE SAME,"enclosed by walls, but shaped out for a resting-place by the rocks, and"

10594,ED.,
10595,ED.,Est et fideli tuta silentio
10596,ED.,Merces:                     (_Carmina_ III. ii. 25)
10597,ED.,
10598,ED.,but I think Wordsworth's reference is quite vague. It is quite
10599,ED.,"appropriate so far, that it was only in the Augustan age that the Romans"
10600,ED.,"got back to the great sources of Greek poetry, and one cause of the"
10601,ED.,superiority of Virgil and Horace to all their contemporaries was that
10602,ED.,"they did this much more thoroughly than the others, and appreciated the"
10603,ED.,purest and oldest of these sources. Horace's special study was of course
10604,ED.,the whole range of Greek lyric poetry. He no doubt acknowledges his
10605,ED.,"relation to Sappho and AlcÃ¦us more than to Simonides, but he recognises"
10606,ED.,him as well as Pindar among the Masters of lyrical poetry. So far as one
10607,ED.,"can judge by the fragments of Simonides' lyrical poetry, I should say"
10608,ED.,"that his characteristics were tenderness, piety, and purity; and, in"
10609,ED.,"these respects, he has a strong affinity with Virgil, which may explain"
10610,ED.,their association together by Wordsworth. The passage quoted by you is
10611,ED.,"very interesting, as showing how Wordsworth--the most essentially modern"
10612,ED.,"and least conventional of poets--regarded Virgil and Horace, who have"
10613,ED.,often been disparaged as types of conventionalism.... It would be very
10614,ED.,interesting to bring together the various passages in which Wordsworth
10615,ED.,draws from the sources of classical poetry. His reminiscences of Latin
10616,ED.,"poetry seem to me to have a peculiar freshness, different from the more"
10617,ED.,"direct reproduction of Milton, Gray, etc.""--ED.]"

10625,ED.,"The following poems may be assigned to the year 1820. _The River Duddon,"
10626,ED.,"a series of Sonnets_, the Ode _To Enterprise_, some of the _Memorials of"
10627,ED.,"a Tour on the Continent_, and a number of _Miscellaneous Sonnets_."
10628,ED.,"Several of the Duddon Sonnets were composed in previous years, and one"
10629,ED.,"of them was published as early as 1807; but, as the volume containing"
10630,ED.,the entire series was published in 1820--and the dedication was written
10631,ED.,on Christmas Eve of that year--the whole has been assigned to 1820. In
10632,ED.,"localising the allusions in these sonnets, I have been greatly indebted"
10633,ED.,"to Mr. Herbert Rix, whose paper contributed to the ""Transactions of the"
10634,ED.,"Wordsworth Society"" was only the first of a Series of admirable studies"
10635,ED.,of the Duddon. I have also been greatly indebted to Canon Rawnsley. Most
10636,ED.,"of the ""Memorials"" of the Continental Tour were written during the"
10637,ED.,"journey; and, although they were not finished till 1822--the year of"
10638,ED.,publication--I think their chronological place should be in the year
10639,ED.,"1820. In connection with these poems, I have had the advantage of"
10640,ED.,"perusing the two singularly interesting Journals of the Tour, written by"
10641,ED.,"Mrs. Wordsworth, and by the poet's sister Dorothy. Both of these were"
10642,ED.,"written, in the form of notes or ""memoranda,"" during the journey. Miss"
10643,ED.,"Wordsworth's was expanded from these earlier jottings, two months after"
10644,ED.,"her return to Rydal Mount; and added to, as late as December 1821. In"
10645,ED.,"the case of each poem, illustrative extracts are given from these two"
10646,ED.,Journals; and it will be seen that they cast much light on the incidents
10647,ED.,"which gave rise to the Memorial Verses, and the circumstances under"
10648,ED.,which they were composed. The poet's wish that these journals should be
10649,ED.,"published, at least in part, is expressed in the Fenwick note, which"
10650,ED.,"precedes the sonnet beginning, ""What lovelier home could gentle Fancy"
10651,ED.,"choose?"" p. 294; and Mrs. Wordsworth, in a letter to Mr. John"
10652,ED.,Kenyon--dated 28th December 1821--after referring to her husband's being
10653,ED.,"""busily engaged upon subjects connected with our Continental Journey,"""
10654,ED.,"says, ""Miss W. is going on with her Journal, which will be ready to go"
10655,ED.,to press interspersed with her brother's Poems I hope before your
10656,ED.,"return."" She adds, however, ""I do not say this seriously, but we"
10657,ED.,"sometimes jestingly talk of raising a fund by such means, for a second"
10658,ED.,"and a farther trip into Italy."" The diary and correspondence of Henry"
10659,ED.,Crabb Robinson is also of use in determining some points connected with
10660,ED.,"this Continental Journey, in which he accompanied the Wordsworths.--ED."

11503,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"myself to a person living in the neighbourhood of Hawkshead, who was"
11504,A SERIES OF SONNETS,going to try his fortune as an angler near the source of the Duddon. We
11505,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"fished a great part of the day with very sorry success, the rain pouring"
11506,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"torrents, and long before we got home I was worn out with fatigue; and,"
11507,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"if the good man had not carried me on his back, I must have lain down"
11508,A SERIES OF SONNETS,under the best shelter I could find. Little did I think then it would be
11509,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"my lot to celebrate, in a strain of love and admiration, the stream"
11510,A SERIES OF SONNETS,which for many years I never thought of without recollections of
11511,A SERIES OF SONNETS,disappointment and distress.
11512,A SERIES OF SONNETS,
11513,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"During my college vacation, and two or three years afterwards, before"
11514,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"taking my Bachelor's degree, I was several times resident in the house"
11515,A SERIES OF SONNETS,of a near relative who lived in the small town of Broughton. I passed
11516,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"many delightful hours upon the banks of this river, which becomes an"
11517,A SERIES OF SONNETS,estuary about a mile from that place. The remembrances of that period
11518,A SERIES OF SONNETS,are the subject of the 21st sonnet. The subject of the 27th is in fact
11519,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"taken from a tradition belonging to Rydal Hall, which once stood, as is"
11520,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"believed, upon a rocky and woody hill on the right hand as you go from"
11521,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"Rydal to Ambleside, and was deserted from the superstitious fear here"
11522,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"described, and the present site fortunately chosen instead. The present"
11523,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"hall was erected by Sir Michael le Fleming, and it may be hoped that at"
11524,A SERIES OF SONNETS,some future time there will be an edifice more worthy of so beautiful a
11525,A SERIES OF SONNETS,position. With regard to the 30th sonnet it is odd enough that this
11526,A SERIES OF SONNETS,imagination was realised in the year 1840 when I made a tour through
11527,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"that district with my wife and daughter, Miss Fenwick and her niece, and"
11528,A SERIES OF SONNETS,Mr. and Mrs. Quillinan. Before our return from Seathwaite Chapel the
11529,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"party separated. Mrs. Wordsworth, while most of us went further up the"
11530,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"stream, chose an opposite direction, having told us that we should"
11531,A SERIES OF SONNETS,overtake her on our way to Ulpha. But she was tempted out of the main
11532,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"road to ascend a rocky eminence near it, thinking it impossible we"
11533,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"should pass without seeing her. This, however, unfortunately happened,"
11534,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"and then ensued vexation and distress, especially to me, which I should"
11535,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"be ashamed to have recorded, for I lost my temper entirely. Neither I"
11536,A SERIES OF SONNETS,nor those that were with me saw her again till we reached the Inn at
11537,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"Broughton, seven miles. This may perhaps in some degree excuse my"
11538,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"irritability on the occasion, for I could not but think she had been"
11539,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"much to blame. It appeared, however, on explanation that she had"
11540,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"remained on the rock, calling out and waving her handkerchief as we were"
11541,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"passing, in order that we also might ascend and enjoy a prospect which"
11542,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"had much charmed her. ""But on we went, her signals proving vain."" How"
11543,A SERIES OF SONNETS,then could she reach Broughton before us? When we found she had not gone
11544,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"on before to Ulpha Kirk, Mr. Quillinan went back in one of the carriages"
11545,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"in search of her. He met her on the road, took her up, and by a shorter"
11546,A SERIES OF SONNETS,"way conveyed her to Broughton, where we were all re-united and spent a"
11547,A SERIES OF SONNETS,happy evening.
11548,A SERIES OF SONNETS,
11549,A SERIES OF SONNETS,I have many affecting remembrances connected with this stream. Those I
11550,A SERIES OF SONNETS,forbear to mention; especially things that occurred on its banks during

13768,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,loud screams. The horse also is naturally afraid of the eagle.--There

13781,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,The reader who may have been interested in the foregoing Sonnets (which
13782,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,together may be considered as a Poem) will not be displeased to find in
13783,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"this place a prose account of the Duddon, extracted from Green's"
13784,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"comprehensive _Guide to the Lakes_, lately published. ""The road leading"
13785,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"from Coniston to Broughton is over high ground, and commands a view of"
13786,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"the river Duddon; which at high water is a grand sight, having the"
13787,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,beautiful and fertile lands of Lancashire and Cumberland stretching each
13788,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"way from its margin. In this extensive view, the face of nature is"
13789,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,displayed in a wonderful variety of hill and dale; wooded grounds and
13790,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"buildings; amongst the latter, Broughton Tower, seated on the crown of a"
13791,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"hill, rising elegantly from the valley, is an object of extraordinary"
13792,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"interest. Fertility on each side is gradually diminished, and lost in"
13793,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"the superior heights of Blackcomb, in Cumberland, and the high lands"
13794,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,between Kirkby and Ulverstone.

13796,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"""The road from Broughton to Seathwaite is on the banks of the Duddon,"
13797,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,and on its Lancashire side it is of various elevations. The river is an
13798,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"amusing companion, one while brawling and tumbling over rocky"
13799,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"precipices, until the agitated water becomes again calm by arriving at a"
13800,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"smoother and less precipitous bed, but its course is soon again ruffled,"
13801,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,and the current thrown into every variety of form which the rocky
13802,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"channel of a river can give to water."" (_Vide_ Green's _Guide to the"

13805,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"After all, the traveller would be most gratified who should approach"
13806,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"this beautiful Stream, neither at its source, as is done in the Sonnets,"
13807,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,nor from its termination; but from Coniston over Walna Scar; first
13808,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"descending into a little circular valley, a collateral compartment of"
13809,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"the long winding vale through which flows the Duddon. This recess,"
13810,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"towards the close of September, when the after-grass of the meadows is"
13811,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"still of a fresh green, with the leaves of many of the trees faded, but"
13812,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"perhaps none fallen, is truly enchanting. At a point elevated enough to"
13813,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"show the various objects in the valley, and not so high as to diminish"
13814,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"their importance, the stranger will instinctively halt. On the"
13815,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"foreground, a little below the most favourable station, a rude"
13816,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"foot-bridge is thrown over the bed of the noisy brook, foaming by the"
13817,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"wayside. Russet and craggy hills, of bold and varied outline, surround"
13818,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,the level valley which is besprinkled with grey rocks plumed with birch
13819,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"trees. A few homesteads are interspersed in some places, peeping out"
13820,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"from among the rocks like hermitages, whose site has been chosen for the"
13821,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"benefit of sunshine as well as shelter; in other instances, the"
13822,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"dwelling-house, barn, and byre, compose together a cruciform structure,"
13823,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"which, with its embowering trees and the ivy clothing part of the walls"
13824,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"and roof, like a fleece, call to mind the remains of an ancient abbey."
13825,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"Time, in most cases, and nature every where, have given a sanctity to"
13826,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"the humble works of man, that are scattered over this peaceful"
13827,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"retirement. Hence a harmony of tone and colour, a consummation and"
13828,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"perfection of beauty, which would have been marred had aim or purpose"
13829,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"interfered with the course of convenience, utility, or necessity. This"
13830,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,unvitiated region stands in no need of the veil of twilight to soften or
13831,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"disguise its features. As it glistens in the morning sunshine, it would"
13832,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,fill the spectator's heart with gladsomeness. Looking from our chosen
13833,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"station, he would feel an impatience to rove among its pathways, to be"
13834,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"greeted by the milkmaid, to wander from house to house, exchanging"
13835,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"""good-morrows"" as he passed the open doors; but, at evening, when the"
13836,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"sun is set, and a pearly light gleams from the western quarter of the"
13837,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"sky, with an answering light from the smooth surface of the meadows;"
13838,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"when the trees are dusky, but each kind still distinguishable; when the"
13839,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,cool air has condensed the blue smoke rising from the cottage-chimneys;
13840,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,when the dark mossy stones seem to sleep in the bed of the foaming
13841,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"Brook; _then_, he would be unwilling to move forward, not less from a"
13842,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"reluctance to relinquish what he beholds, than from an apprehension of"
13843,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"disturbing, by his approach, the quietness beneath him. Issuing from the"
13844,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"plain of this valley, the Brook descends in a rapid torrent, passing by"
13845,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,the churchyard of Seathwaite. The traveller is thus conducted at once
13846,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,into the midst of the wild and beautiful scenery which gave occasion to
13847,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,the Sonnets from the 14th to the 20th inclusive. From the point where
13848,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"the Seathwaite Brook joins the Duddon, is a view upwards, into the pass"
13849,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,through which the River makes its way into the Plain of Donnerdale. The
13850,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,perpendicular rock on the right bears the ancient British name of THE
13851,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"PEN; the one opposite is called WALLA-BARROW CRAG, a name that occurs in"
13852,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,several places to designate rocks of the same character. The _chaotic_
13853,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"aspect of the scene is well marked by the expression of a stranger, who"
13854,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"strolled out while dinner was preparing, and, at his return, being asked"
13855,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"by his host, ""What way he had been wandering?"" replied, ""As far as it is"
13856,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"_finished_!"""
13857,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,
13858,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,The bed of the Duddon is here strewn with large fragments of rock fallen
13859,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"from aloft; which, as Mr. Green truly says, ""are happily adapted to the"
13860,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"many-shaped waterfalls,"" (or rather water-breaks, for none of them are"
13861,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"high,) ""displayed in the short space of half a mile."" That there is some"
13862,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"hazard in frequenting these desolate places, I myself have had proof;"
13863,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"for one night an immense mass of rock fell upon the very spot where,"
13864,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"with a friend, I had lingered the day before. ""The concussion,"" says Mr."
13865,NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII,"Green, speaking of the event, (for he also, in the practice of his art,"

13902,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"In the year 1709, Robert Walker was born at Under-crag, in Seathwaite;"
13903,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"he was the youngest of twelve children. His eldest brother, who"
13904,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"inherited the small family estate, died at Under-crag, aged ninety-four,"
13905,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"being twenty-four years older than the subject of this Memoir, who was"
13906,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"born of the same mother. Robert was a sickly infant; and, through his"
13907,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"boyhood and youth continuing to be of delicate frame and tender health,"
13908,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"it was deemed best, according to the country phrase, to _breed him a"
13909,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,scholar_; for it was not likely that he would be able to earn a
13910,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,livelihood by bodily labour. At that period few of these dales were
13911,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,furnished with school-houses; the children being taught to read and
13912,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"write in the chapel; and in the same consecrated building, where he"
13913,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"officiated for so many years both as preacher and schoolmaster, he"
13914,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,himself received the rudiments of his education. In his youth he became
13915,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"schoolmaster at Loweswater; not being called upon, probably, in that"
13916,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"situation, to teach more than reading, writing, and arithmetic. But, by"
13917,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"the assistance of a ""Gentleman"" in the neighbourhood, he acquired, at"
13918,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"leisure hours, a knowledge of the classics, and became qualified for"
13919,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"taking holy orders. Upon his ordination, he had the offer of two"
13920,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"curacies: the one, Torver, in the vale of Coniston,--the other,"
13921,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"Seathwaite, in his native vale. The value of each was the same, _viz._"
13922,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,five pounds _per annum_: but the cure of Seathwaite having a cottage
13923,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"attached to it, as he wished to marry, he chose it in preference. The"
13924,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"young person on whom his affections were fixed, though in the condition"
13925,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"of a domestic servant, had given promise, by her serious and modest"
13926,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"deportment, and by her virtuous dispositions, that she was worthy to"
13927,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,become the helpmate of a man entering upon a plan of life such as he had
13928,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,marked out for himself. By her frugality she had stored up a small sum
13929,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"of money, with which they began housekeeping. In 1735 or 1736, he"
13930,MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER,"entered upon his curacy; and nineteen years afterwards, his situation is"

14154,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",There is in the above sketch something so extraordinary as to require

14160,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","master employed himself at the spinning-wheel, while the children were"
14161,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","repeating their lessons by his side. Every evening, after school hours,"
14162,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","if not more profitably engaged, he continued the same kind of labour,"
14163,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","exchanging, for the benefit of exercise, the small wheel, at which he"
14164,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","had sate, for the large one on which wool is spun, the spinner stepping"
14165,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","to and fro. Thus, was the wheel constantly in readiness to prevent the"
14166,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","waste of a moment's time. Nor was his industry with the pen, when"
14167,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","occasion called for it, less eager. Intrusted with extensive management"
14168,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","of public and private affairs, he acted, in his rustic neighbourhood, as"

14170,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","etc., with pecuniary gain to himself, and to the great benefit of his"
14171,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",employers. These labours (at all times considerable) at one period of
14172,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","the year, viz., between Christmas and Candlemas, when money transactions"
14173,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","are settled in this country, were often so intense, that he passed great"
14174,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","part of the night, and sometimes whole nights, at his desk. His garden"
14175,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",also was tilled by his own hand; he had a right of pasturage upon the
14176,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","mountains for a few sheep and a couple of cows, which required his"
14177,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","attendance; with this pastoral occupation, he joined the labours of"
14178,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","husbandry upon a small scale, renting two or three acres in addition to"
14179,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",his own less than one acre of glebe; and the humblest drudgery which the
14180,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",cultivation of these fields required was performed by himself.
14181,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",
14182,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","He also assisted his neighbours in haymaking and shearing their flocks,"
14183,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",and in the performance of this latter service he was eminently
14184,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","dexterous. They, in their turn, complimented him with the present of a"
14185,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","haycock, or a fleece; less as a recompense for this particular service"
14186,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",than as a general acknowledgment. The Sabbath was in a strict sense kept
14187,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",holy; the Sunday evenings being devoted to reading the Scripture and
14188,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",family prayer. The principal festivals appointed by the Church were also
14189,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","duly observed; but through every other day in the week, through every"
14190,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",week in the year he was incessantly occupied in work of hand or mind;
14191,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","not allowing a moment for recreation, except upon a Saturday afternoon,"
14192,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","when he indulged himself with a Newspaper, or sometimes with a Magazine."
14193,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","The frugality and temperance established in his house, were as admirable"
14194,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",as the industry. Nothing to which the name of luxury could be given was
14195,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","there known; in the latter part of his life, indeed, when tea had been"
14196,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","brought into almost general use, it was provided for visitors, and for"
14197,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","such of his own family as returned occasionally to his roof, and had"
14198,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",been accustomed to this refreshment elsewhere; but neither he nor his
14199,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",wife ever partook of it. The raiment worn by his family was comely and
14200,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","decent, but as simple as their diet; the home-spun materials were made"
14201,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",up into apparel by their own hands. At the time of the decease of this
14202,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","thrifty pair, their cottage contained a large store of webs of woollen"
14203,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","and linen cloth, woven from thread of their own spinning. And it is"
14204,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","remarkable that the pew in the chapel in which the family used to sit,"
14205,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",remains neatly lined with woollen cloth spun by the pastor's own hands.
14206,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",It is the only pew in the chapel so distinguished; and I know of no
14207,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",other instance of his conformity to the delicate accommodations of
14208,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","modern times. The fuel of the house, like that of their neighbours,"
14209,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","consisted of peat, procured from the mosses by their own labour. The"
14210,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","lights by which, in the winter evenings, their work was performed, were"
14211,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","of their own manufacture, such as still continue to be used in these"
14212,"""ROBERT WALKER.""",cottages; they are made of the pith of rushes dipped in any unctuous
14213,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","substance that the house affords. _White_ candles, as tallow candles are"
14214,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","here called, were reserved to honour the Christmas festivals, and were"
14215,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","perhaps produced upon no other occasions. Once a month, during the"
14216,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","proper season, a sheep was drawn from their small mountain flock, and"
14217,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","killed for the use of the family; and a cow, towards the close of the"
14218,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","year, was salted and dried for winter provision: the hide was tanned to"
14219,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","furnish them with shoes.--By these various resources, this venerable"
14220,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","clergyman reared a numerous family, not only preserving them, as he"
14221,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","affectingly says, ""from wanting the necessaries of life""; but affording"
14222,"""ROBERT WALKER.""","them an unstinted education, and the means of raising themselves in"

14724,W. W. 1822.,"probably a remnant of the old Spanish connection, which, if I do not"

14727,W. W. 1822.,"contest, or rather conflict, of Flemish with French propensities in"
14728,W. W. 1822.,"matters of taste, so conspicuous through other parts of Flanders. The"
14729,W. W. 1822.,hotel to which we drove at Ghent furnished an odd instance. In the
14730,W. W. 1822.,"passages were paintings and statues, after the antique, of Hebe and"
14731,W. W. 1822.,"Apollo; and in the garden, a little pond, about a yard and a half in"
14732,W. W. 1822.,"diameter, with a weeping willow bending over it, and under the shade of"
14733,W. W. 1822.,"that tree, in the centre of the pond a wooden painted statue of a Dutch"

14742,W. W. 1822.,"architecture, etc., has got the mastery; in Ghent there is a struggle:"

15156,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"""Friday, 21st July. Cologne.--I cannot attempt to describe the"
15157,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,Cathedral; nor indeed could any skill of mine do justice to that august
15158,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"pile, even if I might have lingered half a day among its walls. At our"
15159,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"entrance, the evening sunshine rested upon portions of some of the"
15160,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"hundred massy columns; while the shade and gloom, spread through the"
15161,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"edifice, were deepened by those brilliant touches of golden light. Some"
15162,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,of the painted windows were beautified by the melting together and the
15163,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"intermingling of colours, reflected upon the stone-work, colours and"
15164,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"shapes, to the eye as unsubstantial as light itself, and visionary as"
15165,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"the rainbow. The choir is hung with tapestry, designed by Rubens. It"
15166,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"does, I think, to an unlearned eye somewhat resemble Henry the Seventh's"
15167,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"chapel at Westminster, but is much loftier and larger. The long"
15168,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,lancet-shaped painted windows are beautiful. The pillars and arches
15169,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"through the aisles of this Cathedral are of grey stone, sober, solemn,"
15170,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"of great size, yet exquisitely proportioned; and no paltry images or"
15171,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"tinselled altars disturb the one impression of awful magnificence, an"
15172,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"impression received at once, and not to be overcome by regrets, that"
15173,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"_only_ the _Choir_ and side aisles are finished. The nave, at half its"
15174,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"destined height, is covered with a ceiling of boards. The exterior of"
15175,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"this stupendous edifice is of massy, though most _beautiful_,"
15176,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,architecture. Some of the lighter wreaths of stone-work (if great things
15177,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,may be compared with small) made me think of the Chapel of Roslin in its
15178,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"sequestered dell, where the adder's tongue and fern are mingled with"
15179,IN THE CATHEDRAL AT COLOGNE,"green-grown flowers, and leaves of stone that neither fall nor fade."

15460,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,
15461,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"Before this quarter of the Black Forest was inhabited, the source of the"
15462,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,Danube might have suggested some of those sublime images which Armstrong
15463,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,has so finely described; at present the contrast is most striking. The
15464,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,Spring appears in a capacious Stone Basin upon the front of a Ducal
15465,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"palace, with a pleasure-ground opposite; then, passing under the"
15466,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"pavement, takes the form of a little, clear, bright, black, vigorous"
15467,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"rill, barely wide enough to tempt the agility of a child five years old"
15468,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"to leap over it,--and, entering the Garden, it joins, after a course of"
15469,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"a few hundred yards, a Stream much more considerable than itself. The"
15470,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,_copiousness_ of the Spring at _Doneschingen_ must have procured for it
15471,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,the honour of being named the Source of the Danube.--W. W. 1822.
15472,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,
15473,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"""Monday, 31st July.--... We drew towards the town of Villingen, a"
15474,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"foreign-looking place standing in the descent, and lifting up its"
15475,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"metallic dome-like spires, without the accompaniment of a single"
15476,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,tree.... The Church with its two-fold spire glittered in the hot
15477,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"sunshine, like pewter in a melting state. Our guide had told us that"
15478,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,near this place the Danube took its rise; but not so.... At
15479,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,_Doneschingen_ changed horses again. _Here_ we laved in the water which
15480,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"flowed from the source of the majestic Danube, a little, clear, bright,"
15481,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"black rill, that issuing from a capacious stone fountain, into which it"
15482,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"springs, crosses the road, and glides rapidly along the side of a"
15483,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"beautiful pleasure-ground.... We washed, drank, and luxuriated in the"
15484,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"cool and pure waters of this rill, unwilling to quit what we were not"
15485,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"again to see--a reality very different from the stately Danube, so long"
15486,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"an image to the imagination."" (Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)"
15487,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,
15488,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"""Tuesday, 1st August. Villingen.--The landlord seemed to entertain high"
15489,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,ideas of this his native place--its modern improvements in gardens and
15490,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,its former grandeur--and told us that one of his servants should conduct
15491,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"us to the palace, the gardens, the baths, and last of all, though most"
15492,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"the object of our curiosity, to the source of the DANUBE...."
15493,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,
15494,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"""But I seem to have forgotten the source of the Danube, which truly _was"
15495,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"'another'_[HL] Danube after we had seen it; or, more properly speaking,"
15496,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,after we had seen the moor-land country surrounding the Town of
15497,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"Doneschingen, where we knew we should meet with the source of that"
15498,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,famous river; and it is not only _there_ (in that Hollow wild without
15499,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"grandeur), but actually within the walls of the Duke's courts adjoining"
15500,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,the trim flower garden. The bountiful spring is received by a large
15501,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"square stone basin, and thence flows through the gardens in a narrow"
15502,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,stream like a vigorous mill-race. Had an active boy been by our side he
15503,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"would have over-leapt it. That streamlet, after the course of a few"
15504,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"hundred yards, falls into the bed of the united rivers the P---- and the"
15505,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,P---- which take their rise in the _moorish_ hills seen on the right in
15506,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"the road from Villingen, and which we looked upon from the gardens at"
15507,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,the same time that we saw the new-born streamlet (called the source of
15508,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,the Danube) gush into their channel. I suppose it must be the remarkable
15509,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,strength of the spring which has caused it to be dignified with its
15510,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,title; for certainly those other two streams (united a little above the
15511,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,gardens) are the primary sources (of this branch at least) of the
15512,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"Danube."" (From Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal, vol. i.)"
15513,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,
15514,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,What Dorothy Wordsworth mentions in reference to the Danube occurs in
15515,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"many other rivers; _e.g._ the source of the Clyde, in Scotland, is a"
15516,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"tiny burn in Lanarkshire, which, after a short moorland course, falls"
15517,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,(near Elvanfoot) into the large stream of the Daur--the latter having
15518,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,come down for many miles from the Lead Hills district. The P---- and
15519,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,P---- is probably a mistake for B---- and B----. The mountain torrent of
15520,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,"the BregÃ© in the Schwartzwald is joined by the Bregach, and when the"
15521,THE SOURCE OF THE DANUBE,stream receives the waters from the spring in the Castle Garden of

16350,"IN PRESENCE OF THE PAINTED TOWER OF TELL, AT ALTORF",walked up the valley to the reputed birthplace of Tell: it is a small
16351,"IN PRESENCE OF THE PAINTED TOWER OF TELL, AT ALTORF","village at the foot of a glen, rich, yet very wild. A rude unroofed"

16355,"IN PRESENCE OF THE PAINTED TOWER OF TELL, AT ALTORF","rising directly from the river, stands a square tower of grey stone,"
16356,"IN PRESENCE OF THE PAINTED TOWER OF TELL, AT ALTORF","partly covered with ivy, in itself rather a striking object from the"

16360,"IN PRESENCE OF THE PAINTED TOWER OF TELL, AT ALTORF","name, where we again found rough paintings of his exploits, mixed with"
16361,"IN PRESENCE OF THE PAINTED TOWER OF TELL, AT ALTORF",symbols of the Roman Catholic faith. Our walk from Altorf to this
16362,"IN PRESENCE OF THE PAINTED TOWER OF TELL, AT ALTORF",romantic spot had been stifling; along a narrow road between old stone

16365,"IN PRESENCE OF THE PAINTED TOWER OF TELL, AT ALTORF",belonged to the churches and monasteries. Happy were we when we came to

16605,FORT FUENTES[516],The Ruins of Fort Fuentes form the crest of a rocky eminence that rises
16606,FORT FUENTES[516],"from the plain at the head of the Lake of Como, commanding views up the"
16607,FORT FUENTES[516],"Valteline, and toward the town of Chiavenna. The prospect in the latter"
16608,FORT FUENTES[516],direction is characterised by melancholy sublimity. We rejoiced at being
16609,FORT FUENTES[516],"favoured with a distinct view of those Alpine heights; not, as we had"
16610,FORT FUENTES[516],"expected from the breaking up of the storm, steeped in celestial glory,"
16611,FORT FUENTES[516],yet in communion with clouds floating or stationary--scatterings from
16612,FORT FUENTES[516],heaven. The Ruin is interesting both in mass and in detail. An
16613,FORT FUENTES[516],"Inscription, upon elaborately-sculptured marble lying on the ground,"
16614,FORT FUENTES[516],records that the Fort had been erected by Count Fuentes in the year
16615,FORT FUENTES[516],"1600, during the reign of Philip the Third; and the Chapel, about twenty"
16616,FORT FUENTES[516],"years after, by one of his Descendants. Marble pillars of gateways are"
16617,FORT FUENTES[516],"yet standing, and a considerable part of the Chapel walls: a smooth"
16618,FORT FUENTES[516],"green turf has taken place of the pavement, and we could see no trace of"
16619,FORT FUENTES[516],altar or image; but every where something to remind one of former
16620,FORT FUENTES[516],"splendour, and of devastation and tumult. In our ascent we had passed"
16621,FORT FUENTES[516],abundance of wild vines intermingled with bushes: near the ruins were
16622,FORT FUENTES[516],"some ill tended, but growing willingly; and rock, turf, and fragments of"
16623,FORT FUENTES[516],"the pile, are alike covered or adorned with a variety of flowers, among"
16624,FORT FUENTES[516],which the rose-coloured pink was growing in great beauty. While
16625,FORT FUENTES[516],"descending, we discovered on the ground, apart from the path, and at a"
16626,FORT FUENTES[516],"considerable distance from the ruined Chapel, a statue of a Child in"
16627,FORT FUENTES[516],"pure white marble, uninjured by the explosion that had driven it so far"
16628,FORT FUENTES[516],"down the hill. ""How little,"" we exclaimed, ""are these things valued"
16629,FORT FUENTES[516],"here! Could we but transport this pretty Image to our own garden!""--Yet"
16630,FORT FUENTES[516],it seemed it would have been a pity any one should remove it from its

16660,FORT FUENTES[516],"Fort on the summit of a group of Rocks, abruptly rising from the plain,"
16661,FORT FUENTES[516],and overlooking the head of the Lake towards Chiavenna; up the nearer
16662,FORT FUENTES[516],"and larger valley, whence comes the Adda, a river bearing the same name"
16663,FORT FUENTES[516],as that which flows out of the Lake at Lecco; and into the clefts and
16664,FORT FUENTES[516],recesses among the savage Rocks; over the plain; upon the Lake. Wm. had
16665,FORT FUENTES[516],"gone on before D. and myself, and had gained the top of this picturesque"
16666,FORT FUENTES[516],"eminence, by a rough and difficult way. _We_ had determined to be"
16667,FORT FUENTES[516],"satisfied with what we had seen below, when two civil peasants joined"
16668,FORT FUENTES[516],"us, and kindly led us by an easy path to Wm. on the summit. He pointed"
16669,FORT FUENTES[516],"out to us where he had been lost, and separated from Jones; we were"
16670,FORT FUENTES[516],enchanted by the mountain scenery. The whole spot excited the deepest
16671,FORT FUENTES[516],"interest; and, from the very point where we were, this rocky station,"
16672,FORT FUENTES[516],"with its ruined fort, church, dwellings, all desolated by those"
16673,FORT FUENTES[516],"barbarians the French, it was very affecting to see vines--which no"
16674,FORT FUENTES[516],doubt had heretofore been carefully supported by trellises upon these

16676,FORT FUENTES[516],clothed the banks. Lumps and masses of marble--architectural

16678,FORT FUENTES[516],"distance from the grassy glade where the church had stood, lay the"
16679,FORT FUENTES[516],"beautiful statue of a Child, in pure white marble. It seemed strange"

16685,FORT FUENTES[516],
16686,FORT FUENTES[516],"""Wednesday, 5th September. Cadenabbia.--Bent our course toward"
16687,FORT FUENTES[516],Fuentes--and after a wearisome walk through damp and breathless heat (a
16688,FORT FUENTES[516],"full league or more) over a perfect level, we reached the foot of the"
16689,FORT FUENTES[516],"eminence, which from the lake had appeared to be at a small distance,"
16690,FORT FUENTES[516],but it seemed to have retreated as we advanced. We had left the high
16691,FORT FUENTES[516],"road, and trudged over the swampy plain, through which the road must"
16692,FORT FUENTES[516],"have been made with great expense and labour, as it is raised"
16693,FORT FUENTES[516],considerably all the way. The picturesque ruins of the Castle of Fuentes
16694,FORT FUENTES[516],"are at the top of the eminence--wild vines, the bramble and the clematis"
16695,FORT FUENTES[516],cling to the bushes; and beautiful flowers grow in the chinks of the
16696,FORT FUENTES[516],"rocks, and on every bed of grass. A _tempting_ though rugged ascent--yet"
16697,FORT FUENTES[516],"(with the towers in sight above our heads, and two-thirds of the labour"
16698,FORT FUENTES[516],accomplished) Mary and I (Wm. having gone before to discover the nearest
16699,FORT FUENTES[516],and least difficult way for us) sate down determined not to go a step
16700,FORT FUENTES[516],"further. We had a grand prospect; and, being exhausted by the damp"
16701,FORT FUENTES[516],"heat, were willing for once to leave our final object unattained."
16702,FORT FUENTES[516],"However, while seated on the ground, two stout hard-laboured peasants"
16703,FORT FUENTES[516],"chancing to come close to us on the path, invited us forward, and we"
16704,FORT FUENTES[516],could not resist--they led the way--two rough creatures.
16705,FORT FUENTES[516],
16706,FORT FUENTES[516],"""I said to Mary when we were climbing up among the rocks and bushes in"
16707,FORT FUENTES[516],"that wild and lonely place, 'What, you have no fear of trusting yourself"
16708,FORT FUENTES[516],"to a pair of Italian Banditti?' I knew not their occupation, but an"
16709,FORT FUENTES[516],accurate description of their persons would have fitted a novel-writer
16710,FORT FUENTES[516],with ready-made attendants for a tribe of robbers--good-natured and
16711,FORT FUENTES[516],"kind, however they were, nay, even polite in their rustic way as others"
16712,FORT FUENTES[516],tutored to city civility. _Cultivated_ vines grew upon the top of the
16713,FORT FUENTES[516],hill; and they took pains to pluck for us the ripest grapes. We now had
16714,FORT FUENTES[516],"a complete view up the great vale of the Adda, to which, the road that"
16715,FORT FUENTES[516],"we had left conducts the Traveller. Below us, on the other side, lay a"
16716,FORT FUENTES[516],"wide green marshy plain, between the hill of Fuentes and the shores of"
16717,FORT FUENTES[516],"the lake; which plain, spreading upwards, divides the lake; the upper"
16718,FORT FUENTES[516],small reach being called Chiavenna. The path which my Brother had
16719,FORT FUENTES[516],"travelled, when bewildered in the night thirty years ago, was traceable"
16720,FORT FUENTES[516],through some parts of the forest on the opposite side:--and the very
16721,FORT FUENTES[516],passage through which he had gone down to the shore of the lake--then
16722,FORT FUENTES[516],"most dismal with thunder, lightning, and rain. I hardly can conceive a"
16723,FORT FUENTES[516],place of more solitary aspect than the lake of Chiavenna: and the whole
16724,FORT FUENTES[516],of the prospect on that direction is characterized by melancholy
16725,FORT FUENTES[516],"sublimity. We rejoiced, after our toil, at being favoured with a"
16726,FORT FUENTES[516],"distinct view of those sublime heights, not, it is true, steeped in"
16727,FORT FUENTES[516],"celestial hues of _sunny glory_, yet in communion with clouds, floating"
16728,FORT FUENTES[516],or stationary:--scatterings from heaven. The Ruin itself is very
16729,FORT FUENTES[516],"interesting, both in the mass and in detail--an inscription is lying on"
16730,FORT FUENTES[516],the ground which records that the Castle was built by the Count of
16731,FORT FUENTES[516],"Fuentes in the year 1600, and the Chapel about twenty years after by one"
16732,FORT FUENTES[516],of his descendants. Some of the gateways are yet standing with their
16733,FORT FUENTES[516],"marble pillars, and a considerable part of the walls of the Chapel. A"
16734,FORT FUENTES[516],smooth green turf has taken the place of the pavement; and we could see
16735,FORT FUENTES[516],"no trace of altar or sacred image, but everywhere something to remind"
16736,FORT FUENTES[516],"one of former grandeur and of destruction and tumult, while there was,"
16737,FORT FUENTES[516],"in contrast with the imaginations so excited, a melancholy pleasure in"
16738,FORT FUENTES[516],"contemplating the wild quietness of the present day. The vines, near the"
16739,FORT FUENTES[516],"ruin, though ill tended, grow willingly, and rock, turf, and fragments"
16740,FORT FUENTES[516],of the stately pile are alike covered or adorned with a variety of
16741,FORT FUENTES[516],"flowers, among which the rose-coloured pink was in great beauty. In our"
16742,FORT FUENTES[516],"descent we found a fair white cherub, uninjured by the explosion which"
16743,FORT FUENTES[516],had driven it a great way down the hill. It lay bedded like an infant in
16744,FORT FUENTES[516],"its cradle among low green bushes.--W. said to us, 'Could we but carry"
16745,FORT FUENTES[516],this pretty Image to our moss summer-house at Rydal Mount!' yet it
16746,FORT FUENTES[516],seemed as if it would have been a pity that any one should remove it
16747,FORT FUENTES[516],"from its couch in the wilderness, which may be its own for hundreds of"

17232,FOOTNOTES:,"had been overtaken by a fine tall man, who somewhat proudly addressed us"

17234,FOOTNOTES:,"settled near his native place on the Banks of Como, having purchased an"
17235,FOOTNOTES:,"estate near Cadenabbia with the large sum of two thousand pounds,"
17236,FOOTNOTES:,"acquired by selling barometers, looking-glasses, etc. He had been used"

17238,FOOTNOTES:,"preparations during the winter for fresh travels in the spring, at the"
17239,FOOTNOTES:,same time working with her on the small portion of land which they then
17240,FOOTNOTES:,possessed. Portsmouth and Plymouth were the grand marts for his wares.
17241,FOOTNOTES:,He amused us with recitals of adventures among the sailors who used to
17242,FOOTNOTES:,"bully him with, 'Come, you rogue, you get your money easily enough;"
17243,FOOTNOTES:,spend it freely!' and he did not care if he got rid of a guinea or two;
17244,FOOTNOTES:,for he was sure to have it back again after one of the frolics--and much
17245,FOOTNOTES:,more. They would often clear away his whole stock of nick-nacks. This
17246,FOOTNOTES:,industrious trader used to travel on foot at the rate of from thirty to
17247,FOOTNOTES:,"forty miles a day, and his expenses from London to Como were but three"

17738,VI,The Votaress by Lugano's side.
17739,VI,
17740,VI,"""Lugano, Sept. 8, Friday.--... The evening was uncommonly fine; the road"
17741,VI,"shady; bells ringing from the neighbouring chapels, that crested many a"
17742,VI,"steep rock; birds too here, fitfully warbling from the groves; waters"
17743,VI,"gushing through some rocky cleft among the thickets; and I, at my own"
17744,VI,"pace and will, enjoyed a quiet and most refreshing walk. At every step"
17745,VI,"up and down the well-made road, meeting something new, a different"
17746,VI,"shaped mountain, or the same trees under different combinations, a"
17747,VI,"tempting path winding to a village in a dell below, or to a nest of"
17748,VI,"cottages gathered round a spire above, a tinkling stream, or a green"
17749,VI,glade without one; and all the way through a region of stately trees....
17750,VI,Here an elegant-looking peasant Girl was putting on her gay ornaments
17751,VI,"before she entered the Town, where also was a festival. Her dress was so"
17752,VI,"pretty I could not help noticing it, a scarlet chintz frock with a deep"
17753,VI,"figured border, a wide muslin apron, nearly wrapping her round, also"
17754,VI,"with a deep richly wrought border, and slung by white straps over the"
17755,VI,"shoulders, a gold chain round the neck, earrings, etc.; her hair,"
17756,VI,"something like Dora's, nicely braided. Her companions were assisting to"
17757,VI,"put a very beautiful silk handkerchief upon her neck. One of them, from"
17758,VI,"the interest she seemed to take in the arrangements, might be the mother"
17759,VI,"of the Maiden; the other, a younger Sister perhaps, who lent her aid"
17760,VI,"more slackly, and would, I daresay, rather have been in the wild fields"
17761,VI,"gathering flowers to deck a Mayday garland, or to wreath a coronal for"
17762,VI,"_Our Lady's_ head, on this her day of Festival."""
17763,VI,
17764,VI,"The intrepid Nymph, on Uri's steep, descried!"
17765,VI,
17766,VI,is thus referred to by Mrs. Wordsworth:--
17767,VI,
17768,VI,"""Sunday, 20th Aug. Seewen.--... William and I returned later than the"
17769,VI,"rest, having gone further. On reaching a knoll, before we descended into"
17770,VI,"Brunnen, a pretty short-faced, bright-eyed Girl of eighteen or nineteen"
17771,VI,"met us. We enquired the way. She answered; and we bid her good night,"
17772,VI,"and turned from her. Presently she whistled very softly, then sent forth"
17773,VI,"an uncouth sound, more as from the voice of a man than a maiden. It was"
17774,VI,"not a deep sound, but one that might be heard in the Vale and across the"
17775,VI,"Lake, and made the hills about us ring. This was followed by a series of"
17776,VI,"Swiss airs, which she warbled without pause, one after the other, in an"
17777,VI,"impassioned manner, hurrying through as if she wished to reach the"
17778,VI,"utmost limits of her powers, before we were out of hearing; yet I cannot"
17779,VI,but think these modulated notes meant more than we could understand.
17780,VI,They were probably addressed to some one at a distance. There she stood
17781,VI,"upon the naked rock; and, as a waterfall, the sound grew as we listened,"
17782,VI,"so that I even fancied she was following us, in sight of the villages"
17783,VI,"below and around, and her voice must have been known to those nearer"
17784,VI,"dwellings, in one of which she probably found her home."""
17785,VI,
17786,VI,"The ""Sweet Highland Girl!"" is thus described in Dorothy Wordsworth's"
17787,VI,_Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland_ in 1803:--
17788,VI,
17789,VI,"""Sunday, Aug. 28, 1803.--After long waiting, the girls, who had been on"
17790,VI,"the look-out, informed us that the boat was coming. I went to the"
17791,VI,"waterside, and saw a cluster of people on the opposite shore; but being"
17792,VI,"yet at a distance, they looked more like soldiers surrounding a carriage"
17793,VI,than a group of men and women; red and green were the distinguishable
17794,VI,colours. We hastened to get ourselves ready as soon as we saw the party
17795,VI,"approach, but had longer to wait than we expected, the lake being wider"
17796,VI,than it appears to be. As they drew near we could distinguish men in
17797,VI,"tartan plaids, women in scarlet cloaks, and green umbrellas by the"
17798,VI,"half-dozen. The landing was as pretty a sight as ever I saw. The bay,"
17799,VI,"which had been so quiet two days before, was all in motion with small"
17800,VI,"waves, while the swollen waterfall roared in our ears. The boat came"
17801,VI,"steadily up, being pressed almost to the water's edge by the weight of"
17802,VI,"its cargo; perhaps twenty people landed, one after another. It did not"
17803,VI,"rain much, but the women held up their umbrellas; they were dressed in"
17804,VI,"all the colours of the rainbow, and, with their scarlet cardinals, the"
17805,VI,"tartan plaids of the men, and Scotch bonnets, made a gay appearance."
17806,VI,"There was a joyous bustle surrounding the boat, which even imparted"
17807,VI,"something of the same character to the waterfall in its tumult, and the"
17808,VI,"restless grey waves; the young men laughed and shouted, the lasses"
17809,VI,"laughed, and the elder folks seemed to be in a bustle to be away. I"
17810,VI,remember well with what haste the mistress of the house where we were
17811,VI,"ran up to seek after her child, and seeing us, how anxiously and kindly"
17812,VI,"she inquired how we had fared, if we had had a good fire, had been well"
17813,VI,"waited upon, etc. etc. All this in three minutes--for the boatman had"
17814,VI,"another party to bring from the other side, and hurried us off."
17815,VI,
17816,VI,"""The hospitality we had met with at the two cottages and Mr."
17817,VI,Macfarlane's gave us very favourable impressions on this our first
17818,VI,"entrance into the Highlands, and at this day the innocent merriment of"
17819,VI,"the girls, with their kindness to us, and the beautiful figure and face"
17820,VI,"of the elder, come to my mind whenever I think of the ferry-house and"
17821,VI,"waterfall of Loch Lomond, and I never think of the two girls but the"
17822,VI,"whole image of that romantic spot is before me, a living image, as it"
17823,VI,"will be to my dying day."""

18081,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","the Schwarenbach Inn, looked into the valley of Kandersteg, and returned"
18082,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","to the baths of Leuk. Mrs. Wordsworth writes:--""Wed., 13th Sept. Baths"
18083,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",of Leuk.--... On our right we looked down from an immense height into
18084,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","Gastern Thal, a huge cleft, between the snowy Giants, Altels and Blumlis"
18085,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","Alp. The Kandor rises out of this rocky recess, makes a bend at the foot"
18086,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","of our high station, and takes a direct course down the valley before"
18087,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","us.... We were very loath to return, without measuring the tempting vale"
18088,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",through which this river flows. Returned by the same path. On drawing
18089,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","towards the little mountain Inn, the mastiff, hearing our footsteps"
18090,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","before we could see him, or hear his voice, raised such a tumult in the"
18091,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",mountains as produced the effect of a large pack of well-toned hounds in
18092,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",full cry. It was a grand sound. And this reminds me of the fine echoes
18093,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",called forth by a traveller or his guide in the morning. They were
18094,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","before us, as we clomb the Gemmi. The voice was a universal one; and the"
18095,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",prolonged and re-echoed notes could not have been more harmonious had
18096,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","they proceeded from the sweetest instrument."""
18097,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",
18098,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","""Wednesday, 12th September. Baths of Leuk.--The total absence of all"
18099,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",_sound_ of living _creature_ was very striking: silent moths in
18100,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","abundance flew about in the sunshine, and the muddy Lake weltered below"
18101,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",us; the only sound when we checked our voices to listen. Hence we
18102,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",continued to journey over rocky and barren ground till we suddenly
18103,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","looked down into a warm, green nook, into which we must descend. Twelve"
18104,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","cattle were there enclosed by the crags, as in a field of their own"
18105,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","choosing. We passed among them, giving no disturbance, and again came"
18106,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",upon a tract as barren as before. After about two leagues from the top
18107,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","of the Gemmi crags, the summer Chalet, our promised resting-place, was"
18108,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","seen facing us, reared against the stony mountain, and overlooking a"
18109,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",desolate round hollow. Winding along the side of the hill (that deep
18110,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",hollow beneath us to the right) a long half-mile brought us to the
18111,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",platform before the door of the hut. It was a scene of wild gaiety.
18112,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",Half-a-score of youthful travellers (military students from the College
18113,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",of Thun) were there regaling themselves. Mr. Robinson became sociable;
18114,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","and we, while the party stood round us talking with him, had our repast"
18115,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",spread upon the same table where they had finished theirs. They
18116,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",departed; and we saw them winding away towards the Gemmi on the side of
18117,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","the precipice above the dreary hollow--a long procession, not less"
18118,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",interesting than the group at our approach. But every object connected
18119,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",with animated nature (and human life especially) is interesting on such
18120,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",a road as this; we meet no one with a stranger's heart! I cannot forget
18121,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","with what pleasure, soon after leaving the hut, we greeted two young"
18122,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","matrons, one with a child in her arms, the other with hers, a lusty"
18123,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","babe, ruddy with mountain air, asleep in its wicker cradle on her back."
18124,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","Thus laden they were to descend the Gemmi Rocks, and seemed to think it"
18125,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","no hardship, returning us chearful looks while we noticed the happy"
18126,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","burthens which they carried. Those peasant travellers out of sight, we"
18127,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","go on over the same rocky ground, snowy pikes and craggy eminences still"
18128,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",bounding the prospect. But ere long we approach the neighbourhood of
18129,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","trees, and overlooking a long smooth level covered with poor yellowish"
18130,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","grass, saw at a distance, in the centre of the level, a group of"
18131,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","Travellers of a different kind--a party of gentry, male and female, on"
18132,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","mules. On meeting I spoke to the two Ladies in English, by way of trying"
18133,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","their nation, and was pleased at being answered in the same tongue. The"
18134,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","lawn here was prettily embayed, like a lake, among little eminences"
18135,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","covered with dwarf trees, aged or blighted; thence, onward to another"
18136,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","open space, where was an encampment of cattle sheds, the large plain"
18137,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",spotted with heaps of stones at irregular distances.... The turf was
18138,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","very poor, yet so lavishly overspread with close-growing flowers it"
18139,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","reminded us of a Persian Carpet. The _silver_ thistle, as we then named"
18140,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","it, had a singularly beautiful effect; a glistering star lying on the"
18141,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","ground, as if enwrought upon it. An avalanche had covered the surface"
18142,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","with stones many years ago, and many more will it require for nature,"
18143,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","aided by the mountaineers' industry, to restore the soil to its former"
18144,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","fertility. On approaching the destined termination of our descent, we"
18145,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","were led among thickets of Alpine Shrubs, a rich covering of"
18146,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",berry-bearing plants over-spreading the ground. We followed the ridge of
18147,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","this wildly beautiful tract, and it brought us to the brink of a"
18148,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","precipice. On our right, when we looked into the savage valley of"
18149,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","Gastron--upwards toward its head, and downwards to the point where the"
18150,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","Gastron joins the Kandor, their united streams thence continuing a"
18151,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",tumultuous course to the Lake of Thun. The head of the _Kandor Thal_ was
18152,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","concealed from us, to our left, by the ridge of the hill on which we"
18153,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",stood. By going about a mile further along the ridge to the brow of its
18154,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","northern extremity, we might have seen the junction of the two rivers,"
18155,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","but were fearful of being overtaken by darkness in descending the Gemmi,"
18156,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","and were, indeed, satisfied with the prospect already gained. The river"
18157,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","Gastron winds in tumult over a stony channel, through the apparently"
18158,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","level area of a grassless Vale, buried beneath stupendous mountains--not"
18159,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",a house or hut to be seen. A roaring sound ascended to us on the
18160,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",eminence so high above the Vale. How _awful_ the tumult when the River
18161,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",carries along with it the spring tide of melted snow! We had long viewed
18162,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","in our journey a snow-covered pike, in stateliness and height surpassing"
18163,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",all the other eminences. The whole mass of the mountain now appeared
18164,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","before us, on the same side of the Gastron vale on which we were. It"
18165,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","seemed very near to us, and as if a part of its base rose from that"
18166,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",vale. We could hardly believe our Guide when he told us that pike was
18167,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","one of the summits of the Jungfrau, took out maps and books, and found"
18168,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",it could be no other mountain. I never before had a conception of the
18169,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",space covered by the bases of these enormous piles. After lingering as
18170,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","long as time would allow, we began to remeasure our steps, thankful for"
18171,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",the privilege of again feeling ourselves in the neighbourhood of the
18172,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","Jungfrau, and of looking upon those heights that border the Lake of"
18173,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","Thun, at the feet of which we had first entered among the inner windings"
18174,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",of Switzerland. Our journey back to the Chalet was not less pleasant
18175,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","than in the earlier part of the day. The Guide, hurrying on before us,"
18176,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","roused the large house-dog to give us a welcoming bark, which echoed"
18177,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",round the mountains like the tunable voices of a full pack of hounds--a
18178,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",heart-stirring concert in that silent place where no waters were heard
18179,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","at that time--no tinkling of cattle-bells; indeed, the barren soil"
18180,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI",offers small temptation for wandering cattle to linger there. In a few
18181,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","weeks our rugged path would be closed up with snow, the hut untenanted"
18182,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","for the winter, and not a living creature left to rouse the"
18183,"ECHO, UPON THE GEMMI","echoes--echoes which our Bard would not suffer to die with us."" (From"

18619,ELEGIAC STANZAS,The lamented Youth whose untimely death gave occasion to these elegiac
18620,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"verses, was Frederick William Goddard, from Boston in North America. He"
18621,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"was in his twentieth year, and had resided for some time with a"
18622,ELEGIAC STANZAS,clergyman in the neighbourhood of Geneva for the completion of his
18623,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"education. Accompanied by a fellow-pupil, a native of Scotland, he had"
18624,ELEGIAC STANZAS,just set out on a Swiss tour when it was his misfortune to fall in with
18625,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"a friend of mine who was hastening to join our party. The travellers,"
18626,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"after spending a day together on the road from Berne and at Soleure,"
18627,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"took leave of each other at night, the young men having intended to"
18628,ELEGIAC STANZAS,proceed directly to Zurich. But early in the morning my friend found his
18629,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"new acquaintances, who were informed of the object of his journey, and"
18630,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"the friends he was in pursuit of, equipped to accompany him. We met at"
18631,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"Lucerne the succeeding evening, and Mr. G. and his fellow-student became"
18632,ELEGIAC STANZAS,in consequence our travelling companions for a couple of days. We
18633,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"ascended the Righi together; and, after contemplating the sunrise from"
18634,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"that noble mountain, we separated at an hour and on a spot well suited"
18635,ELEGIAC STANZAS,to the parting of those who were to meet no more. Our party descended
18636,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"through the valley of our Lady of the Snow, and our late companions, to"
18637,ELEGIAC STANZAS,Arth. We had hoped to meet in a few weeks at Geneva; but on the third
18638,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"succeeding day (on the 21st of August) Mr. Goddard perished, being"
18639,ELEGIAC STANZAS,overset in a boat while crossing the lake of Zurich. His companion
18640,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"saved himself by swimming, and was hospitably received in the mansion of"
18641,ELEGIAC STANZAS,a Swiss gentleman (M. Keller) situated on the eastern coast of the lake.
18642,ELEGIAC STANZAS,The corpse of poor Goddard was cast ashore on the estate of the same
18643,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"gentleman, who generously performed all the rites of hospitality which"
18644,ELEGIAC STANZAS,could be rendered to the dead as well as to the living. He caused a
18645,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"handsome mural monument to be erected in the church of KÃ¼snacht, which"
18646,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"records the premature fate of the young American, and on the shores too"
18647,ELEGIAC STANZAS,of the lake the traveller may read an inscription pointing out the spot

19510,NOTE B,"On the 15th I went to Solothurn, and an acquaintance began out of which"
19511,NOTE B,"a catastrophe sprang. In the stage between Berne and Solothurn, which"
19512,NOTE B,"takes a circuit through an unpicturesque, flat country, were two very"
19513,NOTE B,"interesting young men, who I soon learned were residing with a"
19514,NOTE B,"Protestant clergyman at Geneva, and completing their education. The"
19515,NOTE B,"elder was an American, aged twenty-one, named Goddard. He had a sickly"
19516,NOTE B,"air, but was intelligent, and not ill-read in English poetry. The other"
19517,NOTE B,"was a fine handsome lad, aged sixteen, of the name of Trotter, son of"
19518,NOTE B,"the then, or late, Secretary to the Admiralty. He was of Scotch descent."
19519,NOTE B,"They were both genteel and well-behaved young men, with the grace"
19520,NOTE B,communicated by living in good company. We became at once
19521,NOTE B,"acquainted,--I being then, as now, _young_ in the facility of forming"
19522,NOTE B,"acquaintance. We spent a very agreeable day and evening together, partly"
19523,NOTE B,"in a walk to a hermitage in the neighbourhood, and took leave of each"
19524,NOTE B,"other at night,--I being bound for Lucerne, they for ZÃ¼rich. But in the"
19525,NOTE B,"morning I saw, to my surprise, my young friends with their knapsacks in"
19526,NOTE B,"their hands ready to accompany me. Goddard said, with a very amiable"
19527,NOTE B,"modesty, ""If you will permit us, we wish to go with you. I am an admirer"
19528,NOTE B,"of Wordsworth's poems, and I should be delighted merely to see him. Of"
19529,NOTE B,"course I expect no more."" I was gratified by this proposal, and we had a"
19530,NOTE B,"second day of enjoyment, and this through a very beautiful country. My"
19531,NOTE B,expectations were not disappointed. I had heard of the Wordsworth party
19532,NOTE B,from travellers with whom we met. I found my friends at the Cheval
19533,NOTE B,"Blanc. From them I had a most cordial reception, and I was in high"
19534,NOTE B,"spirits. Mrs. Wordsworth wrote in her journal: ""H. C. R. was drunk with"
19535,NOTE B,"pleasure, and made us drunk too."" My companions also were kindly"
19536,NOTE B,received.

19540,NOTE B,"Wordsworth and I returned to dinner, and found my young friends already"
19541,NOTE B,in great favour with the ladies. After dinner we walked through the
19542,NOTE B,"town, which has no other remarkable feature than the body of water"
19543,NOTE B,"flowing through it, and the several covered wooden bridges. In the"
19544,NOTE B,angles of the roof of these bridges there are paintings on historical
19545,NOTE B,"and allegorical subjects. One series from the Bible, another from the"
19546,NOTE B,"Swiss war against Austria, a third called the Dance of Death. The last"
19547,NOTE B,"is improperly called, for Death does not force his partner to an"
19548,NOTE B,"involuntary waltz, as in the famous designs which go by Holbein's name,"
19549,NOTE B,but appears in all the pictures an unwelcome visitor. There are feeling
19550,NOTE B,"and truth in many of the conceptions, but the expression is too often"
19551,NOTE B,"ludicrous, and too often coarsely didactic."

19555,NOTE B,"_August 18th._--We sailed on the lake as far as KÃ¼snacht, the two young"
19556,NOTE B,men being still our companions; and between two and three we began to
19557,NOTE B,"ascend the Righi, an indispensable achievement in a Swiss tour. We"
19558,NOTE B,"engaged beds at the Staffel, and went on to see the sun set, but we were"
19559,NOTE B,not fortunate in the weather. Once or twice there were gleams of light
19560,NOTE B,"on some of the lakes, but there was little charm of colouring. After an"
19561,NOTE B,early and comfortable supper we enjoyed the distant lightning; but it
19562,NOTE B,"soon became very severe, and some of the rooms of the hotel were flooded"
19563,NOTE B,"with rain. Our rest was disturbed by a noisy party, who, unable to"
19564,NOTE B,"obtain beds for themselves, resolved that no one else should enjoy his."
19565,NOTE B,"The whole night was spent by them in an incessant din of laughing,"
19566,NOTE B,"singing, and shouting. We were called up between three and four A.M.,"
19567,NOTE B,"but had a very imperfect view from this ""dread summit of the Queen of"
19568,NOTE B,"Mountains""--Regina montium. The most beautiful part of the scene was"
19569,NOTE B,that which arose from the clouds below us. They rose in succession
19570,NOTE B,"sometimes concealing the country, and then opening to our view dark"
19571,NOTE B,"lakes, and gleams of very brilliant green. They sometimes descended as"
19572,NOTE B,if into an abyss beneath us. We saw a few of the snow-mountains
19573,NOTE B,illuminated by the first rays of the sun.
19574,NOTE B,
19575,NOTE B,"My journal simply says: ""After breakfast our young gentlemen left us."" I"
19576,NOTE B,"afterwards wrote, ""We separated at a spot well suited to the parting of"
19577,NOTE B,those who were to meet no more. Our party descended through the valley
19578,NOTE B,"of our 'Lady of the Snow,' and our late companions went to Arth. We"
19579,NOTE B,"hoped to meet in a few weeks at Geneva."""
19580,NOTE B,
19581,NOTE B,"I will leave the order of time, and relate now all that appertains to"
19582,NOTE B,"this sad history. The young men gave us their address, and we promised"
19583,NOTE B,"to inform them when we should be at Geneva, on our return. But on that"
19584,NOTE B,"return we found that poor Goddard had perished in the lake of ZÃ¼rich, on"
19585,NOTE B,the third day after our leave-taking on the Righi.
19586,NOTE B,
19587,NOTE B,I heard the story from Trotter on the 23rd of September. They had put
19588,NOTE B,"themselves in a crazy boat; and a storm arising, the boat overset. It"
19589,NOTE B,"righted itself, but to no purpose. Trotter swam to the shore, but"
19590,NOTE B,Goddard was not seen again. Trotter was most hospitably received by a
19591,NOTE B,"Mr. Keller, near whose house the catastrophe took place. The body was"
19592,NOTE B,"cast ashore next day, and afterwards interred in the neighbouring"
19593,NOTE B,churchyard of KÃ¼snacht. An inscription was placed near the spot where
19594,NOTE B,"the body was found, and a mural monument erected in the church. At the"
19595,NOTE B,"funeral a pathetic address was delivered by the Protestant clergyman,"
19596,NOTE B,which I read in the ZÃ¼rich paper. We were all deeply impressed by the
19597,NOTE B,"event. Wordsworth, I knew, was not fond of drawing the subjects of his"
19598,NOTE B,"poems from occurrences in themselves interesting, and therefore, though"
19599,NOTE B,"I urged him to write on this tragic incident, I little expected he"
19600,NOTE B,"would. There is, however, a beautiful elegiac poem by him on this"
19601,NOTE B,subject. [To the later editions there is prefixed a prose introduction.
19602,NOTE B,"This I wrote. Mr. Wordsworth wrote to me for information, and I drew up"
19603,NOTE B,the account in the first person.]

19607,NOTE B,"To go back to the 19th of August, after parting from our young"
19608,NOTE B,companions we proceeded down the valley in which is the chapel dedicated
19609,NOTE B,"to our Lady of the Snow, the subject of Wordsworth's nineteenth Poem."
19610,NOTE B,The preceding eighteen have to do with objects which had been seen
19611,NOTE B,before I joined the party. The elegiac stanzas are placed near the end
19612,NOTE B,"of the collection, I know not for what reason. The stanzas on the chapel"
19613,NOTE B,express poetically the thoughts which a prosaic mind like mine might
19614,NOTE B,receive from the numerous votive offerings hung on the walls. There are
19615,NOTE B,"pictures representing accidents,--such as drowning, falling from a"
19616,NOTE B,"horse, and the Mother and the Child are in the clouds,--it being"
19617,NOTE B,understood that the escape proceeded from her aid. Some crutches with
19618,NOTE B,painted inscriptions bear witness to the miracles wrought on the lame.

19623,NOTE B,"village, overwhelmed by the slip from the Rossberg."
19624,NOTE B,
19625,NOTE B,"On the 20th at Schwytz, which Wordsworth calls the ""heart"" of"
19626,NOTE B,"Switzerland, as Berne is the ""head."" Passing through Brunnen, we reached"
19627,NOTE B,"Altorf on the 21st, the spot which suggested Wordsworth's twentieth"
19628,NOTE B,effusion. My prose remark on the people shows the sad difference between
19629,NOTE B,"observation and fancy. I wrote: ""These patriotic recollections are"
19630,NOTE B,"delightful when genuine, but the physiognomy of the people does not"
19631,NOTE B,speak in favour of their ancestors. The natives of the district have a
19632,NOTE B,feeble and melancholy character. The women are afflicted by goitre. The
19633,NOTE B,"children beg, as in other Catholic cantons. The little children, with"
19634,NOTE B,"cross-bows in their hands, sing unintelligible songs. Probably Wilhelm"
19635,NOTE B,"Tell serves, like Henri Quatre, as a name to beg by."""

19638,NOTE B,
19639,NOTE B,We next crossed the St. Gotthard. Wordsworth thinks this pass more
19640,NOTE B,beautiful than the more celebrated [a blank here]. We slept successively
19641,NOTE B,"at Amsteg on the 22nd, Hospenthal on the 23rd, and Airolo on the 24th."
19642,NOTE B,"On the way we were overtaken by a pedestrian, a young Swiss, who had"
19643,NOTE B,"studied at Heidelberg, and was going to Rome. He had his flute, and"
19644,NOTE B,"played the Ranz des Vaches. Wordsworth begged me to ask him to do this,"
19645,NOTE B,which I did on condition that he wrote a sonnet on it. It is XXII. of
19646,NOTE B,"the collection. The young man was intelligent, and expressed pleasure in"
19647,NOTE B,"our company. We were sorry when he took French leave. We were English,"
19648,NOTE B,and I have no doubt he feared the expense of having such costly
19649,NOTE B,"companions. He gave a sad account of the German Universities, and said"
19650,NOTE B,"that Sand, the murderer of Kotzebue, had many apologists among the"
19651,NOTE B,students.
19652,NOTE B,
19653,NOTE B,"We then proceeded on our half-walk and half-drive, and slept on the 25th"

19664,NOTE B,"On the 28th we took an early walk up the mountain San Salvador, which"
19665,NOTE B,produced No. XXIV. of Wordsworth's Memorial Poems. Though the weather
19666,NOTE B,"was by no means favourable, we enjoyed a much finer view than from the"
19667,NOTE B,"Righi. The mountains in the neighbourhood are beautiful, but the charm"
19668,NOTE B,of the prospect lies in a glimpse of distant mountains. We saw a most
19669,NOTE B,"elegant pyramid, literally in the sky, partly black, and partly shining"
19670,NOTE B,"like silver. It was the Simplon, Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa were seen in"
19671,NOTE B,"parts. Clouds concealed the bases, and too soon also the summits. This"
19672,NOTE B,splendid vision lasted but a few minutes. The plains of Piedmont were
19673,NOTE B,"hardly visible, owing to the black clouds which covered this part of the"
19674,NOTE B,"horizon. We could, however, see in the midst of a dark surface a narrow"
19675,NOTE B,"ribbon of white, which we were told was the Po. We were told the"
19676,NOTE B,"direction in which Milan lay, but could not see the cathedral."
19677,NOTE B,
19678,NOTE B,"The same day we went on to Menaggio, on the Lake Como. This, in"
19679,NOTE B,"Wordsworth's estimation, is the most beautiful of the lakes. On the 29th"
19680,NOTE B,and 30th we slept at Cadenabbia.

19684,NOTE B,"I wrote in my journal: ""This day has been spent on the lake, and so much"
19685,NOTE B,"exquisite pleasure I never had on water. The tour, or rather excursion,"
19686,NOTE B,we have been making surpasses in scenery all that I have ever made; and
19687,NOTE B,Wordsworth asserts the same. I write now from an inn where we have been
19688,NOTE B,"served with all the promptitude of an English hotel, and with a neatness"
19689,NOTE B,equal to that of Holland. But the pleasure can hardly be recorded. It
19690,NOTE B,consists in the contemplation of scenes absolutely indescribable by
19691,NOTE B,"words, and in sensations for which no words have been even invented. We"
19692,NOTE B,"were lucky in meeting two honest fellows of watermen, who have been"
19693,NOTE B,attentive and not extortionate. I will not enumerate the points of view
19694,NOTE B,"and villas we visited. We saw nothing the guide-books do not speak of."""
19695,NOTE B,
19696,NOTE B,"On the 31st we slept at Como, and next day went to Milan."

19700,NOTE B,At the Ambrosian Library we inspected the famous copy of Virgil which
19701,NOTE B,"belonged to Petrarch. It has in the poet's own handwriting a note,"
19702,NOTE B,stating when and where he first saw Laura. Wordsworth was deeply
19703,NOTE B,"interested in this entry, and would certainly have requested a copy, if"
19704,NOTE B,he had not been satisfied that he should find it in print. The _custos_
19705,NOTE B,"told us that when Buonaparte came here first, and the book was shown"
19706,NOTE B,"him, he seized it, exclaiming, ""This is mine."" He had it bound, and his"
19707,NOTE B,own _N._ marked on it. It came back when the other plunder was restored.
19708,NOTE B,"Another curiosity was a large book by Leonardo da Vinci, full of"
19709,NOTE B,mechanical studies. Wordsworth was much struck with the fact that a man
19710,NOTE B,"who had produced works of so great beauty and sublimity, had prepared"
19711,NOTE B,himself by intense and laborious study of scientific and mathematical
19712,NOTE B,details. It was not till late that he ventured on beauty as exhibited in
19713,NOTE B,the human form.

19717,NOTE B,But the great attraction of this neighbourhood is the celebrated picture
19718,NOTE B,of Leonardo da Vinci in the refectory of the Convent of Maria della
19719,NOTE B,"Grazia. After sustaining every injury from Italian monks, French"
19720,NOTE B,"soldiers, wet, and the appropriation of the building to secular"
19721,NOTE B,"purposes, this picture is now protected by the public sense of its"
19722,NOTE B,excellence from further injury. And more remains of the original than
19723,NOTE B,from Goethe's dissertation I expected to see. The face of our Saviour
19724,NOTE B,appears to have suffered less than any other part. And the countenance
19725,NOTE B,has in it exquisite feeling; it is all sweetness and dignity.

19730,NOTE B,"been far better preserved in the several copies existing, as well as in"
19731,NOTE B,the engraving of Raphael Morgen. There is a sort of mawkish
19732,NOTE B,"sentimentality in the copies of St. John, which always offended me."

19745,NOTE B,"11th Turtman, and the 12th and 13th at the baths of Leuk. From this"
19746,NOTE B,"place we walked up the Gemmi, by far the most wonderful of all the"
19747,NOTE B,"passes of Switzerland I had ever, or have now ever, crossed. The most"
19748,NOTE B,"striking part is a mountain wall 1600 feet in perpendicular height, and"
19749,NOTE B,having up it a zigzag path broad enough to enable a horse to ascend. The
19750,NOTE B,road is hardly visible from below. A parapet in the more dangerous parts
19751,NOTE B,renders it safe. Here my journal mentions our seeing men employed in
19752,NOTE B,picking up bees in a torpid state from the cold. The bees had swarmed
19753,NOTE B,"four days before. It does not mention what I well recollect, and"
19754,NOTE B,"Wordsworth has made the subject of a sonnet, the continued barking of a"
19755,NOTE B,dog _irritated by the echo of his own voice_. In human life this is
19756,NOTE B,perpetually occurring. It is said that a dog has been known to contract
19757,NOTE B,an illness by the continued labour of barking at his own echo. In the
19758,NOTE B,present instance the barking lasted while we were on the spot.
19759,NOTE B,
19760,NOTE B,"I say nothing of Chamouni, where we slept two nights, the 15th and 16th;"
19761,NOTE B,"nor of the roads to it, but that the TÃªte Noire, by which we returned,"
19762,NOTE B,"is still more interesting than the Col de Balme, by which we went. Again"
19763,NOTE B,"at Martigny on the 17th. I should not have omitted to mention that, to"
19764,NOTE B,"add to the sadness produced by the Valais, Wordsworth remarked that"
19765,NOTE B,there the Alps themselves were in a state of decay--crumbling to pieces.
19766,NOTE B,His is the line:--

19768,NOTE B,The human soul craves something that endures.
19769,NOTE B,
19770,NOTE B,"On the 18th we were at Villeneuve, and on the 19th and 20th at Lausanne."
19771,NOTE B,
19772,NOTE B,"At Paris I renewed my old acquaintances, and saw the old sights."
19773,NOTE B,
19774,NOTE B,"On the 8th I left the Wordsworths, who were intending to prolong their"
19775,NOTE B,stay. On the 9th I slept at Amiens; on the 10th was on the road; on the
19776,NOTE B,11th reached Dover; and on the 12th of October slept in my own chambers.
19777,NOTE B,
19778,NOTE B,"""And so,"" my journal says, ""I concluded my tour in excellent health and"
19779,NOTE B,"spirits, having travelled farther, and seen a greater number and a"
19780,NOTE B,"greater variety of sublime and beautiful objects, and in company better"
19781,NOTE B,"calculated to make me feel the worth of these objects, than any it has"
19782,NOTE B,"been my good fortune to enjoy."""
