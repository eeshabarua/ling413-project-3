183,INTRODUCTION.,Whose fitful wailing in the wilderness
184,INTRODUCTION.,"Sounds through the chinks and crannies of my life,"
185,INTRODUCTION.,
186,INTRODUCTION.,"Apollo’s name is sweet, and I were loth"
187,INTRODUCTION.,To let the name of Marsyas stand alone
188,INTRODUCTION.,"Engraven on this book, while I can own"
189,INTRODUCTION.,Allegiance to both lords and love them both.

198,MARSYAS.,
199,MARSYAS.,"Low, but far heard,"
200,MARSYAS.,Across the Phrygian forest goes a sound
201,MARSYAS.,That seems to hush the pines that moan all round.
202,MARSYAS.,Is it the weird
203,MARSYAS.,Wail of a she-wolf plundered of her own?
204,MARSYAS.,Or some maimed Satyr left to die alone?
205,MARSYAS.,"Or has great Pan, in lonely places feared,"
206,MARSYAS.,To some belated wretch his wild face shown?
207,MARSYAS.,
208,MARSYAS.,"Oh strong rough Pan,"
209,MARSYAS.,God of lone spots where sudden awe o’erwhelms
210,MARSYAS.,"Weak souls, but never mine--I love thy realms!"
211,MARSYAS.,I love the wan
212,MARSYAS.,"Half-leafless glens, which Autumn’s plaint repeat"
213,MARSYAS.,From tree to tree; I love the shy fawn’s bleat;
214,MARSYAS.,The cry of lynx and wood-cat safe from man;
215,MARSYAS.,The fox’s short sharp bark from sure retreat.
216,MARSYAS.,
217,MARSYAS.,The deep lone woods
218,MARSYAS.,Which men call silent teem with voice: I hear
219,MARSYAS.,"Vague wails, low calls, weird notes, now far, now near."
220,MARSYAS.,The storm-born floods
221,MARSYAS.,"That sweep the glens, the gurgling hurrying springs"
222,MARSYAS.,"Impart dim secrets, vague prophetic things;"
223,MARSYAS.,The whispering winds awake strange wistful moods.
224,MARSYAS.,"But hush, my flute! Apollo, strike thy strings!"

228,APOLLO.,
229,APOLLO.,The harvest-hymns
230,APOLLO.,"Rise from the fields, where, in the setting sun,"
231,APOLLO.,The reapers stretch by sheaves of golden dun
232,APOLLO.,Their weary limbs;
233,APOLLO.,While many a sunburnt lad or maiden weaves
234,APOLLO.,With every corn-flower that the sickle leaves
235,APOLLO.,"Demeter’s harvest-crowns, or binds and trims"
236,APOLLO.,For the Great Mother her allotted sheaves.
237,APOLLO.,
238,APOLLO.,The whole west glows
239,APOLLO.,Like a vast sea of rosy molten ore
240,APOLLO.,"Where, here and there, great tracks of pearly shore"
241,APOLLO.,Or gleaming rows
242,APOLLO.,Of crimson reefs and isles of amber blaze;
243,APOLLO.,And through the whole a mighty fan of rays
244,APOLLO.,Spreads as the sun approaches earth and throws
245,APOLLO.,A farewell glance before he goes his ways.
246,APOLLO.,
247,APOLLO.,A rich warm scent
248,APOLLO.,Of summer ripeness fills the fertile plain;
249,APOLLO.,"The ox, unyoked, kneels chewing near the wain;"
250,APOLLO.,In one sound blent
251,APOLLO.,The voices of the insect-swarms that fill
252,APOLLO.,"Each furrow, indefatigably trill"
253,APOLLO.,"And chirp and hum; until the bright day spent,"
254,APOLLO.,Invokes the dusk to make the lone fields still.

256,APOLLO.,
257,MARSYAS.,MARSYAS.
258,MARSYAS.,
259,MARSYAS.,What voice-like sounds
260,MARSYAS.,"Off the Trinacrian coast, low, plaintive, sweet,"
261,MARSYAS.,Blend with the breeze? or is it Fancy’s cheat?
262,MARSYAS.,There seem no grounds
263,MARSYAS.,For watch or fear: the waves have sunk to sleep
264,MARSYAS.,In twilight on the bosom of the deep.
265,MARSYAS.,"The ship seems half becalmed, and eve surrounds"
266,MARSYAS.,The crew with dolphins in perpetual leap.
267,MARSYAS.,
268,MARSYAS.,But hark again!
269,MARSYAS.,"Now here, now there, now all around the ship"
270,MARSYAS.,The voices sound each from an unseen lip!
271,MARSYAS.,Dost hear the strain?
272,MARSYAS.,"It charms, it lulls, it lures, yet seems to fill"
273,MARSYAS.,"The soul with something ominous of ill,"
274,MARSYAS.,"A strange vague song with which man strives in vain,"
275,MARSYAS.,Which melts the heart while it benumbs the will.
276,MARSYAS.,
277,MARSYAS.,The weird sounds float
278,MARSYAS.,Across the waters from the rocky shore;
279,MARSYAS.,The listless crew grow drowsy more and more.
280,MARSYAS.,No signs denote
281,MARSYAS.,A coming storm; but something slow and strong
282,MARSYAS.,Sucks unperceived those spell-bound men along:
283,MARSYAS.,"Awake, awake! the whirlpool grasps the boat!"
284,MARSYAS.,"It seethes, it roars, it drowns the Sirens’ song!"
285,MARSYAS.,
286,MARSYAS.,
287,APOLLO.,APOLLO.
288,APOLLO.,
289,APOLLO.,Out on thy strife
290,APOLLO.,"Of winds and birds!--See, see the golden spears"
291,APOLLO.,"Gleam through the dust, and desperate charioteers"
292,APOLLO.,And Death and Life
293,APOLLO.,"Sweep by all wildly blent!--See, see how flash"
294,APOLLO.,"The helmets in the sun, as onward dash"
295,APOLLO.,The waves of war! The very air seems rife
296,APOLLO.,With goading Gods who wield an unseen lash!
297,APOLLO.,
298,APOLLO.,"O Sun, shine down"
299,APOLLO.,"On Freedom’s ranks; pour strength into their hearts,"
300,APOLLO.,And blind the foe with thy resistless darts!
301,APOLLO.,"On, on! the crown"
302,APOLLO.,"Is for you all, both those who live and die!"
303,APOLLO.,"See, see, they waver! now they turn and fly"
304,APOLLO.,"In wild mad rout and trample down their own,"
305,APOLLO.,While thick as autumn leaves their strewn dead lie.
306,APOLLO.,
307,APOLLO.,And as decrease
308,APOLLO.,"The rattle and the roar, the crash and cries,"
309,APOLLO.,"Triumphant hymns from all the vast plain rise,"
310,APOLLO.,And never cease
311,APOLLO.,"To shake the stars.--Sound high, sound high, my strings!"
312,APOLLO.,For from the bloodstained dust the laurel springs;
313,APOLLO.,"Ay, and the olive with its fruit of peace,"
314,APOLLO.,And freedom’s garnered grain and earth’s best things!
315,APOLLO.,
316,APOLLO.,
317,MARSYAS.,MARSYAS.
318,MARSYAS.,
319,MARSYAS.,Right sweetly played!
320,MARSYAS.,"But oh, I love the caves where all is mute"
321,MARSYAS.,"Save unseen dropping waters, or my flute,"
322,MARSYAS.,Whose tones are made
323,MARSYAS.,"So strange by echo, that, transformed, increased,"
324,MARSYAS.,They ape the voice of some wild wounded beast
325,MARSYAS.,Or eager hounds; or wail in cavernous shade
326,MARSYAS.,Like souls in Hades wailing unreleased.
327,MARSYAS.,
328,MARSYAS.,And not less well
329,MARSYAS.,"I love deep gorges, whether, in the spring,"
330,MARSYAS.,With crash of slipping snow their echoes ring;
331,MARSYAS.,Or they compel
332,MARSYAS.,"A summer storm’s pent thunder, peal on peal,"
333,MARSYAS.,To roll along them; or their rent flanks feel
334,MARSYAS.,Autumnal waters roar; or fierce howls tell
335,MARSYAS.,Of captive wintry winds in wild appeal.
336,MARSYAS.,
337,MARSYAS.,"Hark, hark! a scream"
338,MARSYAS.,"Of battling eagles o’er a sheer abyss,"
339,MARSYAS.,And wind of wings above a torrent’s hiss.
340,MARSYAS.,The rock-pent stream
341,MARSYAS.,"Catches the drops of blood, and whirls away"
342,MARSYAS.,The slow rotating feathers from the fray;
343,MARSYAS.,While from the sky the smaller falcons seem
344,MARSYAS.,To watch their kings and circle without stay.

347,APOLLO.,APOLLO.
348,APOLLO.,
349,APOLLO.,"The noon creeps slow,"
350,APOLLO.,"And wraps the windless world in heat and glare,"
351,APOLLO.,And droning beetles stir alone the air;
352,APOLLO.,"While, soft and low,"
353,APOLLO.,A chant of women weaving at the loom
354,APOLLO.,"Falls on the ear from some cool darkened room,"
355,APOLLO.,Where flits the restless shuttle to and fro
356,APOLLO.,Beneath bare arms that glimmer in the gloom.
357,APOLLO.,
358,APOLLO.,A fresh clear chant
359,APOLLO.,"About frail clouds that sea-sprites weave in vain,"
360,APOLLO.,"And woven rainbows, harbingers of rain"
361,APOLLO.,For things that pant;
362,APOLLO.,About Arachne and her wondrous woof;
363,APOLLO.,About grim Time who weaves white hairs in proof
364,APOLLO.,"That men grow old, and that life’s thread grows scant,"
365,APOLLO.,"Weave, women, weave! still Hesperus holds aloof;"
366,APOLLO.,Still shoots the sun
367,APOLLO.,His random shafts through leafy shade to rouse
368,APOLLO.,"The shepherd up, who seeks yet thicker boughs;"
369,APOLLO.,Still peep and run
370,APOLLO.,The bright green lizard on the heated stones;
371,APOLLO.,Still through the glare the whirling beetle drones;
372,APOLLO.,Still noontide sleep may end sweet dreams begun.
373,APOLLO.,"Marsyas, resume thy flute. What say its tones?"
374,APOLLO.,
375,APOLLO.,
376,MARSYAS.,MARSYAS.
377,MARSYAS.,
378,MARSYAS.,Small lurid clouds
379,MARSYAS.,"Veil and unveil the moon; while, through the lone"
380,MARSYAS.,"Wild Phrygian woods, hot gusts of storm-wind moan."
381,MARSYAS.,Each shadow shrouds
382,MARSYAS.,Some unknown conscious harm; and all around
383,MARSYAS.,Glide unseen rustling things upon the ground.
384,MARSYAS.,"The air seems full of grabbing hands, and crowds"
385,MARSYAS.,Of evil fancies wake at every sound.
386,MARSYAS.,
387,MARSYAS.,Now in the night
388,MARSYAS.,"The sorceress prowls, while others slumber deep,"
389,MARSYAS.,Cursing the God who robs her of her sleep.
390,MARSYAS.,The moon’s vague light
391,MARSYAS.,"Makes her knife gleam, as, muttering low,"
392,MARSYAS.,"She seeks the thrice-curst mandrake which uprooted shrieks,"
393,MARSYAS.,Such shrieks as drive the unexpecting wight
394,MARSYAS.,"Who hears them, mad, and blanch her own white cheeks."
395,MARSYAS.,
396,MARSYAS.,"Now sound strange sighs,"
397,MARSYAS.,"If it be true that evil spirits love,"
398,MARSYAS.,And seek each other when the moon above
399,MARSYAS.,Half veils her eyes;
400,MARSYAS.,"The woods repeat unhallowed coos and calls,"
401,MARSYAS.,Kisses and sobs of love whose sound appals
402,MARSYAS.,"Beyond all shrieks, all moanings and all cries,"
403,MARSYAS.,While passion grows as deeper shadow falls.
404,MARSYAS.,
405,MARSYAS.,
406,APOLLO.,APOLLO.
407,APOLLO.,
408,APOLLO.,A golden haze
409,APOLLO.,Has made the bright sea dreamy; and near coasts
410,APOLLO.,"Look far, and faint as sunshine-faded ghosts."
411,APOLLO.,From neighbouring bays
412,APOLLO.,A mingled sense of odoriferous wood
413,APOLLO.,And fallen blossoms floats upon the flood
414,APOLLO.,"That scarcely heaves, save where the dolphins play;"
415,APOLLO.,While some few sea-gulls motionlessly brood.
416,APOLLO.,
417,APOLLO.,"And o’er that sea,"
418,APOLLO.,"Bright, tepid, calm, the sunset breezes waft"
419,APOLLO.,A chant of sailors from a home-bound craft;
420,APOLLO.,The white gulls flee
421,APOLLO.,"At its approach; while from the beach, where run"
422,APOLLO.,"The tidings of return and riches won,"
423,APOLLO.,Come other chants to welcome distantly
424,APOLLO.,The ship that seems to sail from out the sun.
425,APOLLO.,
426,APOLLO.,"Oh ply the oar,"
427,APOLLO.,Ye sun-tanned youths! does patient love not wait
428,APOLLO.,"With tight-strained heart, intent upon your fate?"
429,APOLLO.,The old loved shore
430,APOLLO.,"Is close, close, close! ye hear the lyre’s loud strings--"
431,APOLLO.,Ye almost hear the words that gladness sings.
432,APOLLO.,"Oh ply the oar with might, and each shall pour"
433,APOLLO.,Into Love’s lap the treasures that he brings!
434,APOLLO.,
435,APOLLO.,
436,MARSYAS.,MARSYAS.
437,MARSYAS.,
438,MARSYAS.,Give ear--give ear!
439,MARSYAS.,From yonder grove in sudden gusts there comes
440,MARSYAS.,"A sound of flutes, of cymbals and of drums;"
441,MARSYAS.,And now I hear
442,MARSYAS.,"Wild cries of Mænads who, with ivy crowned,"
443,MARSYAS.,"Toss their mad heads and whirl and leap and bound,"
444,MARSYAS.,"Brandishing snakes; while, in voluptuous fear,"
445,MARSYAS.,The pale ecstatic votaries press around.
446,MARSYAS.,
447,MARSYAS.,"Whirl faster still,"
448,MARSYAS.,"Ye fierce flushed Mænads, lither than the asp,"
449,MARSYAS.,Or gleaming adder writhing in your grasp!
450,MARSYAS.,The wild flutes fill
451,MARSYAS.,"The air with madness! Let the hot shift slip,"
452,MARSYAS.,"And show the panting breast, the glistening hip!"
453,MARSYAS.,"Dance ever faster, though the dance should kill!"
454,MARSYAS.,"Whirl on, with flaming eye and quivering lip!"
455,MARSYAS.,
456,MARSYAS.,"I come, I come,"
457,MARSYAS.,"O Cybele, great Cybele, that hast"
458,MARSYAS.,"Thy chief throne here, I come to thee at last!"
459,MARSYAS.,From my far home
460,MARSYAS.,I bring at last to thy deep rustling grove
461,MARSYAS.,The wild pent fire that in my bosom strove;
462,MARSYAS.,I come to lift thy praise to heaven’s dome;
463,MARSYAS.,"Perchance to die, on tasting thy dread love."
464,MARSYAS.,
465,MARSYAS.,
466,APOLLO.,APOLLO.
467,APOLLO.,
468,APOLLO.,Where sunshine clings
469,APOLLO.,"To Parian columns, what chaste marshalled throng"
470,APOLLO.,"Brings thee, Athena, wreaths of flowers and song?"
471,APOLLO.,Thy pure fane rings
472,APOLLO.,With measured chants; on horses small and fleet
473,APOLLO.,Come stalwart youths; while with restrainèd feet
474,APOLLO.,"The troop of virgins climb the steps, that brings"
475,APOLLO.,The sacred olive and the sacred wheat.
476,APOLLO.,
477,APOLLO.,"Hark, never cease"
478,APOLLO.,The pure chaste hymns to hail the mighty child
479,APOLLO.,"Of the cleft brows of Zeus, all undefiled;"
480,APOLLO.,Armed friend of peace
481,APOLLO.,"From whose strong breastplate streams transcendent light,"
482,APOLLO.,Whose spear makes dim the meteors of the night;
483,APOLLO.,"Pure Patroness of plenty and increase,"
484,APOLLO.,Mistress of sunny cities walled and white!
485,APOLLO.,
486,APOLLO.,"And, oh, to-day,"
487,APOLLO.,"Thou armed and placid Pallas, deadly foe"
488,APOLLO.,Of all things lewd and wild who once didst throw
489,APOLLO.,In scorn away
490,APOLLO.,"The lewd wild flute, too base for thy pure breath,"
491,APOLLO.,"And doom whoe’er should find it to slow death,"
492,APOLLO.,"Come to my aid, and let my pure lyre play"
493,APOLLO.,Such bright chaste sounds as shall deserve the wreath!

500,SISTER MARY OF THE PLAGUE.,
501,I.,I.
502,I.,
503,I.,"In her work there is no flagging,"
504,I.,And her slight frame seems of steel;
505,I.,"And her face and eyes and motions,"
506,I.,"Tried by countless nights of watching,"
507,I.,Nor fatigue nor pain reveal.
508,I.,
509,I.,"Yet the Sisters say she eats not,"
510,I.,"Spurning food as ne’er did saint,"
511,I.,And they murmur: “She is nourished
512,I.,By a miracle of Heaven;
513,I.,God allows not she should faint.”
514,I.,
515,I.,Through the darkened wards she passes
516,I.,On her round from bed to bed;
517,I.,And the sick who wait her coming
518,I.,"Cease their groaning, smiling faintly"
519,I.,As they hear her light quick tread.
520,I.,
521,I.,Through the gabled lanes she hurries;
522,I.,And the ribald men-at-arms
523,I.,"Hush their mirth, and stepping backward"
524,I.,"Let her pass to soothe some death-bed,"
525,I.,Safe from insults and alarms;
526,I.,
527,I.,And the priests and monks and townsfolk
528,I.,Whom she passes greet her sight
529,I.,With a strange respectful pleasure
530,I.,As she nears in dark blue flannel
531,I.,And huge cap of spotless white.
532,I.,
533,I.,"Oh, the busy Flemish city"
534,I.,Knows its Sister Mary well;
535,I.,And the very children show her
536,I.,"To the stranger as she passes,"
537,I.,And her story all can tell:
538,I.,
539,I.,"How she won a lasting glory,"
540,I.,Cleaving to the dread bedside
541,I.,When the Plague with livid pinions
542,I.,"Lighted on the crowded alleys,"
543,I.,And all others fled or died.
544,I.,
545,I.,How alone she made men listen
546,I.,"In their fear, and do her will;"
547,I.,Making help and making order
548,I.,When the customary rulers
549,I.,"Trembled helpless, and stood still."
550,I.,
551,I.,How she had the corpses buried
552,I.,When they choked canal and street;
553,I.,"When alone the shackled convicts,"
554,I.,"Goaded on with pike and halberd,"
555,I.,Cared to near with quaking feet.
556,I.,
557,I.,"But those days of fear are over,"
558,I.,And the pure canal reflects
559,I.,Barges decked with pots of flowers
560,I.,And long rows of tile-faced gables
561,I.,Which no breeze of death infects.
562,I.,
563,I.,And once more the city prospers
564,I.,Through the cunning of its guilds;
565,I.,"While the restless shuttles clatter,"
566,I.,And in peace the busy Fleming
567,I.,Weaves and tans and brews and builds;
568,I.,"And the bearded Spanish troopers,"
569,I.,"Sitting idly in the shade,"
570,I.,"Toss their dice with oath and rattle,"
571,I.,"Or crack jokes with girls that pass them,"
572,I.,Laughing-eyed and unafraid.
573,I.,
574,I.,
575,II.,II.
576,II.,
577,II.,"Sister Mary, Sister Mary,"
578,II.,In thy soul there is some change:
579,II.,For thy face the while thou watchest
580,II.,By a pale young Spanish soldier
581,II.,Works with struggle strong and strange.
582,II.,
583,II.,Thou hast watched a hundred death-beds
584,II.,Ever calm without dismay;
585,II.,Fighting like a steady fighter
586,II.,While the shade of Death pressed onward
587,II.,Night on night and day on day;
588,II.,
589,II.,And when Death had proved the stronger
590,II.,"Thou wouldst heave one sigh at most,"
591,II.,"And then turn to some new moaner,"
592,II.,"Ready to resume the battle,"
593,II.,Just as steady at thy post.
594,II.,
595,II.,Now thy soul is filled with anguish
596,II.,"Strange and wild, thou know’st not why;"
597,II.,While a voice unknown and inward
598,II.,"Seems to whisper, far and faintly,"
599,II.,"“If he dies, thou too wilt die,”"
600,II.,
601,II.,Many months has he been lying
602,II.,In thy ward and rises not;
603,II.,Youth and strength avail him nothing;
604,II.,"Growing daily whiter, whiter;"
605,II.,Dying of men know not what.
606,II.,
607,II.,"And he murmurs: “Sister Mary,"
608,II.,Now the end is nearing fast;
609,II.,"Thou hast nursed me like God’s Angel,"
610,II.,But the hand of God is on me
611,II.,And thy care must end at last.
612,II.,
613,II.,"“I have few, few days remaining;"
614,II.,Now I scarce can draw my breath;
615,II.,See my hand: no blood is in it;
616,II.,"And I feel like one who slowly,"
617,II.,"Slowly, slowly, bleeds to death.”"
618,II.,
619,II.,And his worn and heavy eyelids
620,II.,Close again as if in sleep;
621,II.,While thou lookest at his features
622,II.,With a long and searching anguish
623,II.,In thy eyes--that dare not weep.
624,II.,
625,II.,"Sister Mary, Sister Mary,"
626,II.,"Watch him closer, closer still!"
627,II.,There be things within the boundless
628,II.,"Realm of Horror, unsuspected--"
629,II.,"Things that slowly, slowly, kill!"
630,II.,
631,II.,"In his face there is no colour,"
632,II.,And his hand is ivory-white;
633,II.,But upon his throat is something
634,II.,"Like a small red stain or puncture,"
635,II.,Something like a leech’s bite.
636,II.,
637,II.,"Sister Mary, Sister Mary,"
638,II.,Dost thou see that small red stain?
639,II.,Hast thou never noticed something
640,II.,Like it on the throats of others
641,II.,Whom thy care has nursed in vain?
642,II.,
643,II.,"Have no rumours reached thee, Sister,"
644,II.,Of a Thing that haunts these wards
645,II.,When the scanty sleep thou takest
646,II.,Cheats the sick of the protection
647,II.,Which thy vigilance affords?
648,II.,
649,II.,"When, at night, the ward is silent"
650,II.,"And the night-lamp’s dimness hides,"
651,II.,And the nurse on duty slumbers
652,II.,"In her chair with measured breathing,"
653,II.,"Then it glides, and glides, and glides,"
654,II.,
655,II.,"Like a woman’s form, new risen"
656,II.,"From the grave with soundless feet,"
657,II.,Clad in something which the shadows
658,II.,Of the night-lamp render doubtful
659,II.,Whether robe or winding-sheet.
660,II.,
661,II.,"And its eyes seem fixed and sightless,"
662,II.,Like the eyeballs of the dead;
663,II.,But it gropes not and moves onward
664,II.,"Sure and silent, seeking something,"
665,II.,"In the ward, from bed to bed."
666,II.,
667,II.,"And if any, lying sleepless,"
668,II.,"Sees it, he becomes as stone;"
669,II.,"Terror glues his lips together,"
670,II.,While his eyes are forced to follow
671,II.,"All its movements, one by one."
672,II.,
673,II.,"And he sees it stop, and hover"
674,II.,"Round a bed, with wavering will,"
675,II.,"Like a bat which, ere it settles,"
676,II.,"Flits in circles ever smaller,"
677,II.,"Nearer, nearer, nearer still."
678,II.,
679,II.,Then it bends across the sleeper
680,II.,"Restless in the sultry night,"
681,II.,And begins to fan him gently
682,II.,"With its garment, till his slumber"
683,II.,"Groweth deep, and dreamless quite;"
684,II.,
685,II.,And its corpse-like face unstiffens
686,II.,And its dead eyes seem to gloat
687,II.,"As, approaching and approaching,"
688,II.,It applies its mouth of horror
689,II.,"Slowly, firmly, to his throat."
690,II.,
691,II.,"Sister Mary, Sister Mary,"
692,II.,Has no rumour told thee this?
693,II.,What if he whose life thou lovest
694,II.,"Like thine own, and more, were dying"
695,II.,Of that long terrific kiss?
696,II.,
697,II.,
698,III.,III.
699,III.,
700,III.,"From the Hospital’s arched window,"
701,III.,"Open to the summer air,"
702,III.,You can see the monks in couples
703,III.,All returning home at sunset
704,III.,Through the old cathedral square.
705,III.,
706,III.,"On the steps of the cathedral,"
707,III.,In the weak declining sun
708,III.,Sit the beggars and the cripples;
709,III.,While faint gusts of organ-rolling
710,III.,Tell that vespers have begun.
711,III.,
712,III.,Slowly creeps the tide of shadow
713,III.,"Up the steps of sculptured front,"
714,III.,Driving back the yellow sunshine
715,III.,On each pinnacle and buttress
716,III.,Which the twilight soon makes blunt.
717,III.,
718,III.,"Slowly evening grasps the city,"
719,III.,And the square grows still and lone;
720,III.,"No one passes save, it may be,"
721,III.,"Up the steps and through the portal,"
722,III.,Some stray monk or tottering crone.
723,III.,
724,III.,"In this room, which seems the study"
725,III.,"Of the Hospital’s chief leech,"
726,III.,There is no one; but the twilight
727,III.,"Makes all objects seem mysterious,"
728,III.,Like a conscious watcher each.
729,III.,
730,III.,Here the snakes whose venom healeth
731,III.,Stand in jars in hideous file;
732,III.,While the skulls that crown the book-shelves
733,III.,Seem to grin; and from the ceiling
734,III.,Hangs the huge stuffed crocodile.
735,III.,
736,III.,Here be kept the drugs and cordials
737,III.,"Which the Jew from Syria brings,"
738,III.,"And perchance drugs yet more precious,"
739,III.,"Melted topaz, pounded ruby"
740,III.,Such as save the lives of kings.
741,III.,
742,III.,All is silent in the study;
743,III.,"But the door-hinge creaks anon,"
744,III.,And a woman enters softly
745,III.,Seeking something that seems hidden--
746,III.,One unnaturally wan.
747,III.,
748,III.,What she seeks is not in phials
749,III.,"Nor in jars, but in a book;"
750,III.,And she mutters as she searches
751,III.,Through the book-shelves with a kind of
752,III.,Brooding hurry in her look;
753,III.,
754,III.,"And she finds the book, and takes it"
755,III.,To the window for more light;
756,III.,And she reads a passage slowly
757,III.,With constrained and hissing breathing
758,III.,And dark brow contracted tight.
759,III.,
760,III.,"“_Most of them_,” it says, “_are corpses"
761,III.,"That have lain beneath the moon,"
762,III.,"And that quit their graves at midnight,"
763,III.,Prowling round to prey on sleepers;
764,III.,But the daybreak scares them soon_.
765,III.,
766,III.,"“_But the worst, called soulless bodies,"
767,III.,Plague the world but now and then;
768,III.,They have died in some great sickness;
769,III.,But reviving in the moonbeams
770,III.,Rise once more and mix with men_.
771,III.,
772,III.,"“_And they act and feel like others,"
773,III.,"Never guessing they be dead,"
774,III.,Common food of men they love not;
775,III.,"But at night, impelled by hunger,"
776,III.,In their sleep they quit their bed_;
777,III.,
778,III.,"“_And they fasten on some sleeper,"
779,III.,Feeding on his living blood;
780,III.,"Who, when life has left his body,"
781,III.,"Must in turn arise, and, prowling,"
782,III.,Seek the like accursed food_.”
783,III.,
784,III.,And the book slips from her fingers
785,III.,And she casts her down to pray;
786,III.,"But convulsions seize and twist her,"
787,III.,And delirious ramblings mingle
788,III.,With the prayers she tries to say.
789,III.,
790,III.,"In her mouth there is a saltness,"
791,III.,On her lips there is a stain;
792,III.,In her soul there is a horror;
793,III.,In her vitals there is something
794,III.,More like raging thirst than pain;
795,III.,
796,III.,"And she cries, “O God, I knew it:"
797,III.,"Have I not, at dead of night,"
798,III.,"Waking up, looked round and found me"
799,III.,On the ledge of roofs and windows
800,III.,"In my shift, and shrunk with fright?"
801,III.,
802,III.,"“Have I not, O God of mercy,"
803,III.,"Passed by shambles in the street,"
804,III.,And stopped short in monstrous craving
805,III.,For the crimson blood that trickled
806,III.,In the gutter at my feet?
807,III.,
808,III.,"“Did I not, at last Communion,"
809,III.,Cough the Holy Wafer out?
810,III.,"Blood I suck, but Christ’s blood chokes me."
811,III.,"O my God, my God, vouchsafe me"
812,III.,Some strong light in this great doubt!”
813,III.,
814,III.,And she sinketh crushed and prostrate
815,III.,"In the twilight on the floor,"
816,III.,"While the darkness grows around her,"
817,III.,And her quick and laboured breathing
818,III.,Grows convulsive more and more.
819,III.,
820,III.,
821,IV.,IV.
822,IV.,
823,IV.,"Sister Mary, all is quiet"
824,IV.,"In thy wards, and midnight nears:"
825,IV.,Seek the scanty rest thou needest;
826,IV.,"Seek the scanty rest thou grudgest,"
827,IV.,All is hushed and no one fears.
828,IV.,
829,IV.,"But, though midnight, Sister Mary"
830,IV.,Thinks it yet not time to go;
831,IV.,And the night-lamps shining dimly
832,IV.,Show her vaguely in the shadow
833,IV.,Moving softly to and fro.
834,IV.,
835,IV.,"What is it that she is doing,"
836,IV.,Flitting round one sleeper’s bed;
837,IV.,"Is she sprinkling something round it,"
838,IV.,"Something white as wheaten flour,"
839,IV.,And on which she will not tread?
840,IV.,
841,IV.,"And at last the work is over,"
842,IV.,And she goeth to her rest;
843,IV.,"And she sleeps at once, exhausted"
844,IV.,"By long labour, and, it may be,"
845,IV.,By strong struggles in her breast.
846,IV.,
847,IV.,Nothing breaks upon the stillness
848,IV.,"Of the night, except, afar,"
849,IV.,Some faint shouts of ending revel
850,IV.,"Or of brawling, in the quarters"
851,IV.,Where the Spanish soldiers are.
852,IV.,
853,IV.,Time wades slowly through the darkness
854,IV.,"Till at last it reaches day,"
855,IV.,And the city’s many steeples
856,IV.,Buried in the starless heaven
857,IV.,Grow distinct in sunless grey.
858,IV.,
859,IV.,"And the light wakes Sister Mary,"
860,IV.,"And she dresses in strange haste,"
861,IV.,"Giving God no prayer, and leaving"
862,IV.,On her bed the beads and crosses
863,IV.,That should dangle from her waist.
864,IV.,
865,IV.,And with unheard steps she hurries
866,IV.,Through the ward where all sleep on
867,IV.,To the bed in which is lying
868,IV.,He who day by day is growing
869,IV.,More inexorably wan.
870,IV.,
871,IV.,All around the bed is sprinkled
872,IV.,"Something white, like thin fresh snow,"
873,IV.,Where a naked foot has printed
874,IV.,"In the night a many footprints,"
875,IV.,Sharp and clear from heel to toe:
876,IV.,
877,IV.,"Sister Mary, Sister Mary,"
878,IV.,Dost thou know thy own small foot?
879,IV.,Would it fit those marks which make thee
880,IV.,Turn more pale than thy own paleness
881,IV.,If upon them it were put?
882,IV.,
883,IV.,And the dying youth smiles faintly
884,IV.,Pleasure’s last accorded smile;
885,IV.,"And he murmurs as he hears her,"
886,IV.,"“Sister Mary, I am better;"
887,IV.,Let me hold thy hand awhile:
888,IV.,
889,IV.,"“Sister Mary, I would tell thee"
890,IV.,Fain one thing before I die;
891,IV.,For a dying man may utter
892,IV.,What another must keep hidden
893,IV.,In the fastness of a sigh.
894,IV.,
895,IV.,"“Sister Mary, I have loved thee--"
896,IV.,Is it sin to tell thee this?
897,IV.,"And I dreamt--O God, be lenient"
898,IV.,If ’tis sin--that thou didst give me
899,IV.,"On the throat a long, long kiss.”"

1021,PORPHYRION.,I cursed the perilous lustre of thy eyes;

1072,PORPHYRION.,"Before me lay the waste, strewn here and there"
1073,PORPHYRION.,"With ribs of men and camels, or the wreck"

1081,PORPHYRION.,"I made my lair, alone with stones and God;"
1082,PORPHYRION.,Living off locusts and such scanty herbs
1083,PORPHYRION.,As grew in clefts of rock and empty wells.
1084,PORPHYRION.,"Oh what a silence, what a loneliness!"
1085,PORPHYRION.,The temple columns and the huge carved stones
1086,PORPHYRION.,Cast long black shadows on the sun-baked sand
1087,PORPHYRION.,In endless rows; and through the livelong day
1088,PORPHYRION.,"No moving shadow crossed them save my own,"
1089,PORPHYRION.,"As, like a leper whom his sores have doomed"
1090,PORPHYRION.,"To lead the lonely life, I prowled for food."
1091,PORPHYRION.,"Oh, it was hard! For knowing that the Fiend"
1092,PORPHYRION.,Would come ere long to scare and tempt me back
1093,PORPHYRION.,"To human haunts, I sought with prayer, and scourge,"
1094,PORPHYRION.,"And thirst, and hunger, and restricted sleep"
1095,PORPHYRION.,To arm myself against him and his strength;
1096,PORPHYRION.,"And come he did. He prowled at first at night,"
1097,PORPHYRION.,"Shaped as a roaring lion, round and round"
1098,PORPHYRION.,My lonely cell; but his re-echoing roar
1099,PORPHYRION.,"Deterred me not, nor stopped a single prayer."
1100,PORPHYRION.,And then he came with soft insidious step
1101,PORPHYRION.,"During my sleep, and strove to tempt the flesh"
1102,PORPHYRION.,"In woman’s guise--yea, in thy very shape--"
1103,PORPHYRION.,"And sought to lure me to caress and kiss,"
1104,PORPHYRION.,"Taking thy face, thy eyes, thy very voice"
1105,PORPHYRION.,In all their beauty and their blandishment;
1106,PORPHYRION.,"But I defied him, and he howling fled,"
1107,PORPHYRION.,And changed his plan. He made the solid ground
1108,PORPHYRION.,Lurch ever and anon beneath my feet;
1109,PORPHYRION.,He made me shiver in the blazing sun
1110,PORPHYRION.,"With mortal cold; and sometimes, in the dusk"
1111,PORPHYRION.,He made the huge stone heads of sphinxes nod
1112,PORPHYRION.,"And gibber as I passed them. Oh, for years"

1114,PORPHYRION.,But I o’ercame his strength.

1123,DIOCLEA.,"As well as thou? Ay, ay, they came, the fiends;"
1124,DIOCLEA.,"They whispered in my ear that I was young,"
1125,DIOCLEA.,And that my youth was passing unenjoyed;
1126,DIOCLEA.,They whispered in my ear that I was fair--
1127,DIOCLEA.,"Fairer than any other far or near,"
1128,DIOCLEA.,And that the beauty that a fool had spurned
1129,DIOCLEA.,Would wane before its time. They said: “Look up!
1130,DIOCLEA.,"Thou mournest Love whom thou believest dead,"
1131,DIOCLEA.,"And Love, hard by, is waiting for one word,"
1132,DIOCLEA.,"One motion of encouragement, one glance."
1133,DIOCLEA.,"Give but the signal, and the lonely one"
1134,DIOCLEA.,"Whom maid and matron scorn, and who now holds"
1135,DIOCLEA.,"Suspiciously aloof from life and joy,"
1136,DIOCLEA.,"Will be a very Empress new-enthroned,"
1137,DIOCLEA.,"And waste her life no more.” But oh, I clung"
1138,DIOCLEA.,To the dull honour of my broken life;
1139,DIOCLEA.,I struggled with the Tempter long and hard;
1140,DIOCLEA.,I said unto myself that after all
1141,DIOCLEA.,Thou mightst at last return to me; and strove
1142,DIOCLEA.,With all my strength to keep me pure for thee.
1143,DIOCLEA.,"But years went by and still thou didst not come,"
1144,DIOCLEA.,"And round and round my heart the Tempter prowled,"
1145,DIOCLEA.,"Nearer and ever nearer with new arts,"
1146,DIOCLEA.,"New wiles, new snares, new whispers, day by day,"
1147,DIOCLEA.,And proved at last the stronger of the two.
1148,DIOCLEA.,I fled my father’s house for ever more;
1149,DIOCLEA.,I loved; was loved; I saw luxurious cities
1150,DIOCLEA.,"Where pleasure triumphed--Alexandria,"
1151,DIOCLEA.,"Antioch and Athens, ay, and even Rome--"
1152,DIOCLEA.,Courted where’er I went; until the day
1153,DIOCLEA.,"When he proved false, and when once more I sat"
1154,DIOCLEA.,Upon my lonely bed and prayed for dawn.
1155,DIOCLEA.,"And yet I loved again; yea, twice and thrice."
1156,DIOCLEA.,"Down, down the winding stair of love I went,"
1157,DIOCLEA.,Until the slippery and precipitous steps
1158,DIOCLEA.,Became so dark and noisome all at once
1159,DIOCLEA.,That I threw up my arms and shrieked in fear;
1160,DIOCLEA.,"But all my strength was gone, and heaven’s faint light"
1161,DIOCLEA.,"Too far above my head. Oh, since we two"
1162,DIOCLEA.,"Last saw each other’s eyes, not thou alone"
1163,DIOCLEA.,"Hast felt the scourge alight upon thy back,"
1164,DIOCLEA.,Not thou alone hast known the howling waste;
1165,DIOCLEA.,For I have felt that nine times knotted scourge
1166,DIOCLEA.,Which makes the soul and not the body writhe.
1167,DIOCLEA.,Descending on me fiercely; and have found
1168,DIOCLEA.,"In men’s embrace a loneliness more dread,"
1169,DIOCLEA.,A desert more terrific and more bare
1170,DIOCLEA.,Than any which thy bruised unsandalled foot
1171,DIOCLEA.,Has ever trodden yet.
1172,DIOCLEA.,
1173,DIOCLEA.,
1174,PORPHYRION.,PORPHYRION.
1175,PORPHYRION.,
1176,PORPHYRION.,The worse for thee.
1177,PORPHYRION.,I freed thee from the weight of human ties;
1178,PORPHYRION.,I pointed out the path that leads to heaven
1179,PORPHYRION.,"Across life’s wreck; and if, instead of God,"
1180,PORPHYRION.,"Thou chosest Satan, what is that to me?"
1181,PORPHYRION.,Thou mightst have built a mansion for thy soul
1182,PORPHYRION.,Upon the ruins of an earthly home;
1183,PORPHYRION.,"Thou mightst like me have wrestled with the Fiend,"
1184,PORPHYRION.,And felt the pride of bruising with thy heel
1185,PORPHYRION.,The Tempter’s head; thou mightst like me have felt
1186,PORPHYRION.,The fierce voluptuous pleasure of the scourge;
1187,PORPHYRION.,"Nay, even, like myself thou mightst, with time,"
1188,PORPHYRION.,"Have sought to snatch from Heaven’s hand the crown,"
1189,PORPHYRION.,The glorious crown of martyrdom: for if
1190,PORPHYRION.,Upon this day thou meetest me so near
1191,PORPHYRION.,"The haunts of men, it is because I wait"
1192,PORPHYRION.,For some fresh outburst of the Pagan’s wrath
1193,PORPHYRION.,"Against our sect, to court the lingering death."
1194,PORPHYRION.,"But lo, we waste our words; for I have warned"
1195,PORPHYRION.,And summoned thee to leave the perilous brink
1196,PORPHYRION.,Of this dark circling water; and if thou
1197,PORPHYRION.,Still cleavest to thy heathenish design
1198,PORPHYRION.,"Of self-destruction, not upon my soul"
1199,PORPHYRION.,Shall fall the wrath of Heaven for the deed.
1200,PORPHYRION.,"Once more I bid thee, woman, leave the brink;"
1201,PORPHYRION.,"For see, the night has come; and, as thou say’st,"
1202,PORPHYRION.,God needs my evening prayer.
1203,PORPHYRION.,
1204,PORPHYRION.,
1205,DIOCLEA.,DIOCLEA.
1206,DIOCLEA.,
1207,DIOCLEA.,"Ay, ay, the night"
1208,DIOCLEA.,Has wrapped us round: I scarce can see the flowers
1209,DIOCLEA.,That glimmered on the current; though I hear
1210,DIOCLEA.,The sweet faint rustling of the stream-bent reeds.
1211,DIOCLEA.,"Pass on thy way, lone man--pass on in peace;"
1212,DIOCLEA.,"There is no link between us, and no love."
1213,DIOCLEA.,"Go, find thy rest, as I at last find mine;"
1214,DIOCLEA.,"And leave me here, beside the deep lone Nile,"
1215,DIOCLEA.,"Where woe will sink, and haply leave no trace."
1216,DIOCLEA.,

1220,HUNTING THE KING.,HUNTING THE KING.

1222,HUNTING THE KING.,1792.
1223,HUNTING THE KING.,
1224,HUNTING THE KING.,
1225,HUNTING THE KING.,"And the two in the twilight spurred fiercely again,"
1226,HUNTING THE KING.,"While behind them went trooping the trees,"
1227,HUNTING THE KING.,"And the darkening rutty cross-roads of Champagne,"
1228,HUNTING THE KING.,"With their patches of wood and their patches of grain,"
1229,HUNTING THE KING.,Grew more solemn and lone by degrees.
1230,HUNTING THE KING.,
1231,HUNTING THE KING.,"Like the hurrying ghosts of two riders they rode,--"
1232,HUNTING THE KING.,"For the few whom they met, indistinct;"
1233,HUNTING THE KING.,And the lights that sprang up few and far away showed
1234,HUNTING THE KING.,"Where, to right or to left, lay a human abode;"
1235,HUNTING THE KING.,And more stars overhead came and winked.
1236,HUNTING THE KING.,
1237,HUNTING THE KING.,"Through the maze of cross-roads they went ever more fast,"
1238,HUNTING THE KING.,As if he who led on never doubted;
1239,HUNTING THE KING.,Till the other by dint of hard spurring at last
1240,HUNTING THE KING.,"Brought his horse alongside, and between them there passed"
1241,HUNTING THE KING.,Hurried words that were broken and shouted.
1242,HUNTING THE KING.,
1243,HUNTING THE KING.,“Slacken pace! slacken pace!” “Spur him on without stay!
1244,HUNTING THE KING.,What’s a horse to the saving of France?”
1245,HUNTING THE KING.,“Art thou sure of the place where they change the relay?”
1246,HUNTING THE KING.,"“At Varennes, nigh on twelve. Trust to me for the way!"
1247,HUNTING THE KING.,France is saved if we get in advance!”
1248,HUNTING THE KING.,
1249,HUNTING THE KING.,"And the postmaster Drouet once more shot ahead,"
1250,HUNTING THE KING.,Closely followed by Guillaume his friend;
1251,HUNTING THE KING.,"Never seeming to waver or doubt as he led,"
1252,HUNTING THE KING.,Or to see less distinct the invisible thread
1253,HUNTING THE KING.,Of short-cut on short-cut without end.
1254,HUNTING THE KING.,
1255,HUNTING THE KING.,But the roads and the fields and the low hedges grew
1256,HUNTING THE KING.,"Every minute more lonely and dark,"
1257,HUNTING THE KING.,"While his horse, nearly merged in the darkness, now drew"
1258,HUNTING THE KING.,From the flint of the road with its thundering shoe
1259,HUNTING THE KING.,Every minute more brilliant a spark.
1260,HUNTING THE KING.,
1261,HUNTING THE KING.,But he thought in his heart: “If the moon does not rise
1262,HUNTING THE KING.,"When we get to the woods, I shall doubt;"
1263,HUNTING THE KING.,"And he’ll get to the army and German allies,"
1264,HUNTING THE KING.,"And the land, unprepared, will be caught by surprise,"
1265,HUNTING THE KING.,And the great revolution stamped out.”
1266,HUNTING THE KING.,
1267,HUNTING THE KING.,"But a glow, faint at first, and then brighter, was spread"
1268,HUNTING THE KING.,"In the sky, and the moon showed her face,"
1269,HUNTING THE KING.,And the plain and the hills were lit up far and wide;
1270,HUNTING THE KING.,"And a galloping shadow appeared at his side,"
1271,HUNTING THE KING.,And took part all at once in the race.
1272,HUNTING THE KING.,
1273,HUNTING THE KING.,Oh the moon that plays tricks with the shadows she throws
1274,HUNTING THE KING.,Might have given that shadow the shape
1275,HUNTING THE KING.,"Of the Rider who rides us all down, friends and foes,"
1276,HUNTING THE KING.,And was now ere their time coming down upon those
1277,HUNTING THE KING.,Who had trusted to God for escape.
1278,HUNTING THE KING.,
1279,HUNTING THE KING.,"Hurry on, ye postillions, so royally paid,"
1280,HUNTING THE KING.,That suspect not a King and a Queen!
1281,HUNTING THE KING.,Though ye never have heard in the course of your trade
1282,HUNTING THE KING.,"Of a thing that the doctors of Paris have made,"
1283,HUNTING THE KING.,Of a thing that they call Guillotine!
1284,HUNTING THE KING.,
1285,HUNTING THE KING.,Hurry on to the chopper-shaped square of Varennes
1286,HUNTING THE KING.,Where your fellow-postillions await!
1287,HUNTING THE KING.,"Hurry on! hurry on, ye dull whip-cracking men!"
1288,HUNTING THE KING.,"For each stride that ye take, there is one who takes ten,"
1289,HUNTING THE KING.,And who gallops like Death and like Fate!
1290,HUNTING THE KING.,
1291,HUNTING THE KING.,He caught sight of a face in the dark carriage-hood
1292,HUNTING THE KING.,"As ye rolled from his door and were gone,"
1293,HUNTING THE KING.,And he looked with a closeness that boded no good
1294,HUNTING THE KING.,At the crumpled bank-note where that face graven stood--
1295,HUNTING THE KING.,Hurry on! hurry on! hurry on!
1296,HUNTING THE KING.,
1297,HUNTING THE KING.,"There were clouds near the moon, and they girt her about"
1298,HUNTING THE KING.,"As if trying to screen and to save,"
1299,HUNTING THE KING.,And the darkness one moment filled Drouet with doubt;
1300,HUNTING THE KING.,But she baffled them all and shone brilliantly out
1301,HUNTING THE KING.,To abet with the light that she gave.
1302,HUNTING THE KING.,
1303,HUNTING THE KING.,And the stems of the corn flashed metallic and bright
1304,HUNTING THE KING.,"And like bayonets distantly blue,"
1305,HUNTING THE KING.,And the breeze-rippled patches of grain in the light
1306,HUNTING THE KING.,Looked like distant battalions restrained from the fight
1307,HUNTING THE KING.,That a thrill of impatience runs through.
1308,HUNTING THE KING.,
1309,HUNTING THE KING.,"But the patches of grain grew more scanty anon,"
1310,HUNTING THE KING.,And the road grew more hard to discern;
1311,HUNTING THE KING.,And they entered the lonely dark woods of Argonne
1312,HUNTING THE KING.,"Where the moon through the branches could ill help them on,"
1313,HUNTING THE KING.,And they trampled on brushwood and fern.
1314,HUNTING THE KING.,
1315,HUNTING THE KING.,As they galloped each oak with its black knotty arm
1316,HUNTING THE KING.,Seemed to grab at the two like a claw;
1317,HUNTING THE KING.,"While the air seemed all full of destruction and harm,"
1318,HUNTING THE KING.,And the one who rode second felt vaguely alarm
1319,HUNTING THE KING.,At each shadow and shape that he saw.
1320,HUNTING THE KING.,
1321,HUNTING THE KING.,"But the other dashed on, as with hounds on the scent"
1322,HUNTING THE KING.,"In his thundering, thundering speed;"
1323,HUNTING THE KING.,Giving neither a thought to his horse nearly spent
1324,HUNTING THE KING.,"Nor a look to his comrade, but solely intent"
1325,HUNTING THE KING.,On a prey that was royal indeed.
1326,HUNTING THE KING.,
1327,HUNTING THE KING.,"Did no angel of life, as he spurred yet more fast,"
1328,HUNTING THE KING.,"Cry, “O God, for a slip or a stumble"
1329,HUNTING THE KING.,That shall save from the block the heads sinking at last
1330,HUNTING THE KING.,"Into sleep, now that fear of pursuers is past,"
1331,HUNTING THE KING.,And the heads of a many more humble!
1332,HUNTING THE KING.,
1333,HUNTING THE KING.,"“O Thou God for a doubt that shall bring to a stop,"
1334,HUNTING THE KING.,"For a stone in the shoe to retard,"
1335,HUNTING THE KING.,Or more heads in the basket of sawdust will drop
1336,HUNTING THE KING.,Than the bunches of grapes that the vintagers lop
1337,HUNTING THE KING.,On a day that their labour is hard;
1338,HUNTING THE KING.,"“And the fields will be lashed not by tempests of rain,"
1339,HUNTING THE KING.,But by tempests of iron and lead;
1340,HUNTING THE KING.,"And manured year by year with fresh blood all in vain,"
1341,HUNTING THE KING.,"And each summer will bring not a harvest of grain,"
1342,HUNTING THE KING.,But a harvest of cripples and dead;
1343,HUNTING THE KING.,
1344,HUNTING THE KING.,“And the nations in carnage will ceaselessly strive
1345,HUNTING THE KING.,With a roar that disperses the clouds;
1346,HUNTING THE KING.,Where the trains of artillery furiously drive
1347,HUNTING THE KING.,"And the gun-wheels make ruts through the dead and the live,"
1348,HUNTING THE KING.,And the balls make long lanes through the crowd.
1349,HUNTING THE KING.,
1350,HUNTING THE KING.,"“Let his horse break a vein or his saddle a girth,"
1351,HUNTING THE KING.,"Trip him up on the rough, hardened mud!"
1352,HUNTING THE KING.,For each drop from the rowel that falls to the earth
1353,HUNTING THE KING.,"If he reaches Varennes, O Thou God, will give birth"
1354,HUNTING THE KING.,To an ocean of innocent blood!”
1355,HUNTING THE KING.,
1356,HUNTING THE KING.,Or did spirits invisible fly by his side
1357,HUNTING THE KING.,And in whispers excite him and goad
1358,HUNTING THE KING.,"And exulting foretell him the end of his ride,"
1359,HUNTING THE KING.,As his spur-mangled horse with his long fatal stride
1360,HUNTING THE KING.,One by one killed the miles of the road.
1361,HUNTING THE KING.,
1362,HUNTING THE KING.,"Did they cry: “Lash him on, as in lightness of heart"
1363,HUNTING THE KING.,They have ridden the people to death;
1364,HUNTING THE KING.,"Lash him on, as the Saviour of France that thou art;"
1365,HUNTING THE KING.,"Lash him on, till the blood from his nostrils shall start;"
1366,HUNTING THE KING.,Lash him on! never think of his breath!”
1367,HUNTING THE KING.,
1368,HUNTING THE KING.,Did they cry: “Lash him on without mercy or stay!”
1369,HUNTING THE KING.,"As his arm, numb with lashing, desisted;"
1370,HUNTING THE KING.,"“Lash him on, as the quarterers lashed on the day"
1371,HUNTING THE KING.,"When their horses ’mid clapping of hands tugged away,"
1372,HUNTING THE KING.,And the live limbs of Damiens resisted!
1373,HUNTING THE KING.,
1374,HUNTING THE KING.,"“Lash him on, for the freedom of nations depends"
1375,HUNTING THE KING.,On the flag which at last is unfurled!
1376,HUNTING THE KING.,"Lash him on, lash him on, till his very life ends!"
1377,HUNTING THE KING.,"Lash him on, lash him on, for the breath that he spends"
1378,HUNTING THE KING.,"Is for Freedom, and France, and the World!"
1379,HUNTING THE KING.,
1380,HUNTING THE KING.,“So shall Kellermann’s steed at Marengo be spurred
1381,HUNTING THE KING.,"When the earth by his squadrons is shaken,"
1382,HUNTING THE KING.,"And the thunder of man o’er God’s thunder is heard,"
1383,HUNTING THE KING.,"And there runs from the Alps to the Tiber one word,"
1384,HUNTING THE KING.,And the lands from their torpor awaken!
1385,HUNTING THE KING.,
1386,HUNTING THE KING.,“So the couriers shall spur and the miles disappear
1387,HUNTING THE KING.,"From the Oder, the Elbe, and the Po,"
1388,HUNTING THE KING.,When the victories follow each other so near
1389,HUNTING THE KING.,That the bearers of tidings are filled with a fear
1390,HUNTING THE KING.,Lest another their tidings outdo!
1391,HUNTING THE KING.,
1392,HUNTING THE KING.,"“Lash him on, lash him on! and the three-coloured flag"
1393,HUNTING THE KING.,That has sprung from the black Paris gutter
1394,HUNTING THE KING.,Shall be carried by plain and by valley and crag
1395,HUNTING THE KING.,"And, all riddled by bullets, a mere tattered rag,"
1396,HUNTING THE KING.,From Alhambra to Kremlin shall flutter!”
1397,HUNTING THE KING.,
1398,HUNTING THE KING.,"And he lashed, and he left his companion behind"
1399,HUNTING THE KING.,"And sped furiously on all alone,"
1400,HUNTING THE KING.,With the sinister shadow the moon had designed
1401,HUNTING THE KING.,"Flitting on just in front of him, vaguely defined,"
1402,HUNTING THE KING.,At a pace that was wild as his own.
1403,HUNTING THE KING.,
1404,HUNTING THE KING.,"And as midnight was nearing, at last there appeared"
1405,HUNTING THE KING.,"The faint lights of Varennes far ahead,"
1406,HUNTING THE KING.,"And then only it was, as he finally cleared"
1407,HUNTING THE KING.,"The last miles of the road, that he suddenly feared"
1408,HUNTING THE KING.,That his horse might fall suddenly dead.
1409,HUNTING THE KING.,
1410,HUNTING THE KING.,But his horse did not drop; and with thundering feet
1411,HUNTING THE KING.,He dashed on to the inn of the Post;
1412,HUNTING THE KING.,"While he shouted to all that his eye chanced to meet,"
1413,HUNTING THE KING.,“Sound the tocsin! the tocsin! all up the long street!
1414,HUNTING THE KING.,Bar the Bridge! bar the Bridge! or all’s lost!”
1415,HUNTING THE KING.,
1416,HUNTING THE KING.,And the patriots crouched in the shade of the old
1417,HUNTING THE KING.,"Narrow archway, all holding their breath;"
1418,HUNTING THE KING.,"Till a carriage and four was heard coming, and rolled"
1419,HUNTING THE KING.,"Slowly, heavily, in; while the tocsin still tolled"

1428,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Ye righteous Judges of this Christian state,"
1429,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Ye bid me speak; ye bid me show good cause

1431,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Yea, even with the blood of my own child,"
1432,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Of my own Edith, should not be condemned"
1433,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"To die upon the scaffold, nor be locked"
1434,ABRAHAM CAREW.,For life within a mad-house: and I speak.
1435,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"I fear not death; for now that she is dead,"
1436,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Now that dull silence hath replaced her voice,"
1437,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Life hath but little charm; and were it not
1438,ABRAHAM CAREW.,That to consent to ignominious death
1439,ABRAHAM CAREW.,For having acted by command of God
1440,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Would be unfit, and might call down His wrath"
1441,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Upon the land, I think I scarce should take"
1442,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"The pains to plead; but strength hath narrow bounds,"
1443,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And I confess intolerable fear
1444,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Lest ye condemn me to complete my years
1445,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Among the mad. O Thou Almighty God
1446,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Who for Thy purposes inscrutable
1447,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Hast pushed me on and nerved my quaking arm
1448,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"To slay my child, preserve from such dread fate"
1449,ABRAHAM CAREW.,One who has offered up what most he loved
1450,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Here upon earth, and give unto my tongue"
1451,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Such eloquence as may convince these men
1452,ABRAHAM CAREW.,That I am sane!
1453,ABRAHAM CAREW.,
1454,ABRAHAM CAREW.,I am a self-made man
1455,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Grown rich by building engines for the rail,"
1456,ABRAHAM CAREW.,A man of little learning; one whose youth
1457,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Was spent in striking sparks from reddened iron
1458,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Amid the roar and clanging of a forge;
1459,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Knowing no books except the Book of books,"
1460,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Whose sacred pages when my work was done
1461,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"I turned with grimy hands, therein to learn"
1462,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"The will and orders of a jealous God,"
1463,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"A God of wrath, a God whose unseen hand"
1464,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Falls heavily and chasteningly on all,"
1465,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And most on them He loveth. Little time
1466,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Did I bestow on pleasure and those sports,"
1467,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Unseemly for the most part, which divert"
1468,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"The spirit from obedience, and prevent"
1469,ABRAHAM CAREW.,The growth of labour’s fruit; and God allowed
1470,ABRAHAM CAREW.,That I should prosper in my worldly wealth.
1471,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And that the name of Abraham Carew
1472,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Should hold high credit in the market-place,"
1473,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And that my fellow-townsmen one and all
1474,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Should put their faith in my integrity,"
1475,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Electing me an Elder of the Church
1476,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"And civil Magistrate. But, as I say,"
1477,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"The Lord doth love to chasten; and He laid,"
1478,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"As years went by and multiplied my store,"
1479,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Great tribulations on me. One by one
1480,ABRAHAM CAREW.,I saw the godly household which had grown
1481,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Around me, fall as fell the summer flowers"
1482,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Around an aged tree when winter nears,"
1483,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And leave him in his listless loneliness.
1484,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"One child alone, one twining clinging flower--"
1485,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Edith, my latest born--remained unnipped,"
1486,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And in my rash presumption I believed
1487,ABRAHAM CAREW.,That God would spare her; for upon her cheek
1488,ABRAHAM CAREW.,The hectic spot appeared not which had marked
1489,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Her mother and her brethren; and I saw
1490,ABRAHAM CAREW.,With sinful joy how she increased in strength

1492,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Yea, yea, a sinful joy which was to rouse"
1493,ABRAHAM CAREW.,The jealousy of God. But if my tongue
1494,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Is to convince you of the thing I tell
1495,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"And justify His ways, oh let me speak--"
1496,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Oh let me tell you how I loved my child!
1497,ABRAHAM CAREW.,I loved her as an old man loves the sun
1498,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Which warms his limbs and keeps the palsy off;
1499,ABRAHAM CAREW.,I loved her as the plundered miser loves
1500,ABRAHAM CAREW.,The small secreted heap that yet remains;
1501,ABRAHAM CAREW.,I loved her as the shipwrecked drowning wretch
1502,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Loves the frail plank which each approaching wave
1503,ABRAHAM CAREW.,May tear from his embrace.
1504,ABRAHAM CAREW.,
1505,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"No vain gold chain,"
1506,ABRAHAM CAREW.,No gaudy ribbon decked her nut-brown hair;
1507,ABRAHAM CAREW.,But in such sober raiment as befits
1508,ABRAHAM CAREW.,The virgin-mistress of a godly house
1509,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"She went the round of her domestic duties,"
1510,ABRAHAM CAREW.,In need of no adornment to enhance
1511,ABRAHAM CAREW.,The chaste and holy beauty which she wore
1512,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Unconscious to herself, and lived her life"
1513,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Of cheerfulness and thrift, beloved by all;"
1514,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Reading at morn and eve the Bible page
1515,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"To our assembled servants, in a clear"
1516,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And reverent voice; devoting patient hours
1517,ABRAHAM CAREW.,To teaching little children; and by help
1518,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Of her own needle, plied while others slept,"
1519,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Providing winter clothing for the poor
1520,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Before the earliest chill of autumn came.
1521,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"A grave and gracious girl, whose smile of love"
1522,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Was as a light for my declining years;
1523,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Who prized the walks which we were wont to take
1524,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Together, through the lanes and ripening corn,"
1525,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Above all routs and shows. Too great, too great"
1526,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"To please a jealous God, had grown the love"
1527,ABRAHAM CAREW.,For Edith in my bosom; and at times
1528,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"I felt a cruel tightening of the heart,"
1529,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And a prophetic something seem to say
1530,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Unto my spirit: “Abraham, beware!"
1531,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"The Lord will claim His rights, and ask again"
1532,ABRAHAM CAREW.,For that which He hath given unto thee.
1533,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Thy love is given to an earthly thing;
1534,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"A common, natural instinct rules thy life,"
1535,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And not the love of God.” But on her cheek
1536,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"The ruddiness of health diminished not,"
1537,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And I loved on.
1538,ABRAHAM CAREW.,
1539,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"There came a Sabbath day,"
1540,ABRAHAM CAREW.,On which it chanced that at the Meeting House
1541,ABRAHAM CAREW.,The Scripture page was read in which it said
1542,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"How he whose name I bear, in days of yore"
1543,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Obeyed the dire injunction of the Lord,"
1544,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And offered up his Isaac. By my side
1545,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Edith was sitting listening to the words
1546,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"With fixed attention, as was e’er her wont."
1547,ABRAHAM CAREW.,The light athwart the high and narrow window
1548,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Streamed down upon her, lighting up her hair"
1549,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"With golding streakings, just as rays of sun"
1550,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Light up the seaweed in a tide-left pool,"
1551,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And played upon her features--ne’er before
1552,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Had she appeared so lovely. As my eyes
1553,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Were resting thus upon her sitting there,"
1554,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"A fear flashed through my spirit, and I thought:"
1555,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"“What if the Lord were to demand her life,"
1556,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And bid thee offer up thy only child
1557,ABRAHAM CAREW.,As Abraham did Isaac?” and I felt
1558,ABRAHAM CAREW.,A strange and frightful struggle stir my soul--
1559,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Yea, stir my nature to its inmost depths."
1560,ABRAHAM CAREW.,I listened little to the words of prayer;
1561,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"And on our homeward way, when Edith asked"
1562,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"What made my brow so suddenly o’ercast,"
1563,ABRAHAM CAREW.,I answered not.
1564,ABRAHAM CAREW.,
1565,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Ye wise and upright men
1566,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Who sit to-day deciding on my fate,"
1567,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Ye wonder at the measure of my speech
1568,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Ye miss what ye expected ye would find,"
1569,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"A madman’s incoherence, or the glare"
1570,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And desperate wild defence of guilt at bay?
1571,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Confess, confess, I speak not like the mad."
1572,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Oh, I have drilled and disciplined my tongue"
1573,ABRAHAM CAREW.,In these long months of prison; I
1574,ABRAHAM CAREW.,From morn to eve within my narrow cell
1575,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Taming my own excitement, so that if,"
1576,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"When came the day of trial, God should make"
1577,ABRAHAM CAREW.,No outward revelation of the truth
1578,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"To save His servant, I might yet convince"
1579,ABRAHAM CAREW.,My judges and the world. He hath not deigned
1580,ABRAHAM CAREW.,To make the attestation at my prayer.
1581,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"No thunder from the blue unclouded sky,"
1582,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"No quaking of the earth hath helped my cause,"
1583,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And God hath left me only earthly means
1584,ABRAHAM CAREW.,To prove to men that what they call a crime
1585,ABRAHAM CAREW.,I did by His command.
1586,ABRAHAM CAREW.,
1587,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"It came, it came,"
1588,ABRAHAM CAREW.,That dread command! I had not long to wait;
1589,ABRAHAM CAREW.,I seemed to feel it coming; day and night
1590,ABRAHAM CAREW.,The frightful expectation filled my soul;
1591,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"And by a natural instinct, thrice accurst,"
1592,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"The more I dreaded that an angry God,"
1593,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Roused by the sinful greatness of my love,"
1594,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Would claim her life, the more my love increased."
1595,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"It came, it came, the awful summons came!"
1596,ABRAHAM CAREW.,It was the dead of night: I lay awake;
1597,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"And in the soundless darkness, all at once,"
1598,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"While on my flesh the hair from fear stood up,"
1599,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"I heard the awful voice: it cried, “Arise,"
1600,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Take up thy knife, and sacrifice thy child"
1601,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Whom I bestowed; for I the Lord thy God,"
1602,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"I am a jealous God, and bid thee strike.”"
1603,ABRAHAM CAREW.,
1604,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Then came three days of human agony;
1605,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"The flesh contending with the will of God,"
1606,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And writhing upward like a trodden snake
1607,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Beneath religion’s heel: for I believed
1608,ABRAHAM CAREW.,That God would pardon me three days’ delay
1609,ABRAHAM CAREW.,To conquer human nature. Once I thought
1610,ABRAHAM CAREW.,To tell her all--to ask her for her life--
1611,ABRAHAM CAREW.,To call on her obedience to submit--
1612,ABRAHAM CAREW.,To shift upon her shoulders half the weight
1613,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Of agony and horror; but I looked
1614,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Upon her face and set aside the plan,"
1615,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Misdoubting woman’s strength. In Edith’s eyes
1616,ABRAHAM CAREW.,I saw a strange suspicious look--a look
1617,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Which told me that the tempest in my soul
1618,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Was finding outward vent upon my face.
1619,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"I caught her watching me, and understood"
1620,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"That if I struck not soon, perchance my arm"
1621,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Would be restrained by man; so I prepared.
1622,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"There was a spot beside the sedgy stream,"
1623,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"A solitary spot, which in our walks"
1624,ABRAHAM CAREW.,We sometimes crossed. I led her out that way.
1625,ABRAHAM CAREW.,It was a hot close day; no ray of sun
1626,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Shone through the lowering clouds, and now and then"
1627,ABRAHAM CAREW.,The thunder’s distant rumble met the ear.
1628,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"We reached the lonely river-bank. I stopped,"
1629,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"And was about to do it, when she laid"
1630,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Her hand upon my arm with a caress,"
1631,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And asked me in her sweet familiar voice
1632,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"To pluck a water-lily, which I did,"
1633,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"And then walked on, for somehow I was balked;"
1634,ABRAHAM CAREW.,I could not do it.
1635,ABRAHAM CAREW.,
1636,ABRAHAM CAREW.,With the fall of night
1637,ABRAHAM CAREW.,The pent-up tempest burst; and in its roar
1638,ABRAHAM CAREW.,I seemed to hear God’s formidable wrath.
1639,ABRAHAM CAREW.,I heard it in the howling of the wind;
1640,ABRAHAM CAREW.,I heard it in the pelting of the rain
1641,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Against the windows; and each rattling peal,"
1642,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Each burst of rolling echo in the dark
1643,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Which made me cower like a chastened hound
1644,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Recalled me to obedience. But the flesh,"
1645,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"The strong rebellious flesh, oh how it writhed"
1646,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Against the spirit! How the natural love,"
1647,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"The common human instinct, fought and fought,"
1648,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"And, backed by Satan’s whisper, held its own!"
1649,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"At length the spirit conquered, and I rose"
1650,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"To do the will of God; but, in my crushed"
1651,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"And humbled anguish, I implored the Lord"
1652,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"To stay my lifted arm, and at the last"
1653,ABRAHAM CAREW.,To save her life as Isaac’s had been saved.
1654,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Then I went up the stairs, as if each step"
1655,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Were a delay, a respite, and a hope,"
1656,ABRAHAM CAREW.,And sought the chamber where my Edith slept.
1657,ABRAHAM CAREW.,The walk had worn her limbs; her sleep was deep.
1658,ABRAHAM CAREW.,The storm had not aroused her; nor did I.
1659,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"I kissed her, and I slew her; for the Lord"
1660,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Did not vouchsafe to stay His servant’s arm.
1661,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"For one short moment after she was dead,"
1662,ABRAHAM CAREW.,I thought perchance that He would bring her back
1663,ABRAHAM CAREW.,To life. But all was silent there.
1664,ABRAHAM CAREW.,
1665,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"And now,"
1666,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Ye righteous judges of this Christian land,"
1667,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Ye godly Elders, look me in the face."
1668,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Ye know ye dare not hang me. Will ye dare
1669,ABRAHAM CAREW.,To place me in the madhouse for a deed
1670,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Which God Himself exacted--which ye teach
1671,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Your children to revere in Abraham
1672,ABRAHAM CAREW.,From year to year? Ye know ye dare not do it.
1673,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"And if ye ask me how I knew God’s voice,"
1674,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Ask of the shepherd’s watch-dog how he knows
1675,ABRAHAM CAREW.,His master’s call when darkness girds the fold!
1676,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Ye know that Abraham of old, if now"
1677,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"He stood before you, could at your command"
1678,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Give you no other answer. It was God
1679,ABRAHAM CAREW.,"Who, putting to the test His servant’s faith,"
1680,ABRAHAM CAREW.,Impelled my hand. Ye may not judge this deed.

1861,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Of the nation’s slaughtered sons;
1862,SWORD AND SICKLE.,But no other traces show
1863,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Where a few short years ago
1864,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Countless balls of iron ploughed
1865,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Through the serried quivering crowd--
1866,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Where the broadcast Austrian lead
1867,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Fell on furrows live and dead--
1868,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Where for miles and miles were heaped
1869,SWORD AND SICKLE.,The human harvests freshly reaped--
1870,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Where the routed fled like chaff
1871,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"At the canon’s thunderous laugh,"
1872,SWORD AND SICKLE.,While the gun-wheels made red mud
1873,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Of men weltering in their blood.
1874,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Times are changed, and memories hold"
1875,SWORD AND SICKLE.,In the breasts but of the old.
1876,SWORD AND SICKLE.,On Custozza’s once red earth
1877,SWORD AND SICKLE.,By the Lombard peasant’s hearth
1878,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Now the Austrian may sit
1879,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Where no brows with hate shall knit:
1880,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Who would dream that there can be
1881,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Such a thing as tyranny?
1882,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Italy appeals no longer
1883,SWORD AND SICKLE.,To God’s throne against the stronger;
1884,SWORD AND SICKLE.,And the Poet loves her now
1885,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"For the beauty of her brow,"
1886,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Not for that great crown of woe
1887,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Whence the blood-drops used to flow.
1888,SWORD AND SICKLE.,
1889,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Lands are freed, and lands enslaved;"
1890,SWORD AND SICKLE.,But your name is there engraved
1891,SWORD AND SICKLE.,In the hearts of those now freed
1892,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Ye who helped them in their need!
1893,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Nor do they remember now
1894,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Those who lent them all the glow
1895,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Of their genius and their feeling,"
1896,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"And Compassion’s balm that’s healing,"
1897,SWORD AND SICKLE.,And the thunder of their curse
1898,SWORD AND SICKLE.,In a heaven-shaking verse.
1899,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Reckon not on thanks for long,"
1900,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Ye who fight with sword or song
1901,SWORD AND SICKLE.,For the weak against the strong:
1902,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Give your help for justice’ sake,"
1903,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Caring no reward to take.
1904,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Freedom’s face is not less fair
1905,SWORD AND SICKLE.,For remembering not your share;
1906,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"And the sheaves of sacred wheat,"
1907,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Which spring up beneath her feet
1908,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"From the liberated plain,"
1909,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Not less full of golden grain.
1910,SWORD AND SICKLE.,
1911,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Years ago one day I stood,"
1912,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"In the autumn’s sunset flood,"
1913,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Looking down with sweeping sight
1914,SWORD AND SICKLE.,From a bastion’s terraced height
1915,SWORD AND SICKLE.,On the then unconquered plain
1916,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Of the fair and French Lorraine.
1917,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Scarce was autumn’s first leaf yellow;
1918,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Ripened Earth had made air mellow.
1919,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Like a snake inert and blue,"
1920,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Winding slowly corn-fields through,"
1921,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Wound the broad Moselle afar
1922,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"To the horizon’s utmost bar,"
1923,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Catching on each burnished fold
1924,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Restless gleams of molten gold
1925,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Till the sun was near to sink,"
1926,SWORD AND SICKLE.,When it caught a flaming pink
1927,SWORD AND SICKLE.,From the crimson clouds slow sailing
1928,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Where the amber light was failing.
1929,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"And surveying that expanse,"
1930,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"What, I thought, is fair as France?"
1931,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Now the Prussian sentries stand
1932,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Where I stood, and scan the land,"
1933,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Which for ever seems their own,"
1934,SWORD AND SICKLE.,With their ugly Prussian frown;
1935,SWORD AND SICKLE.,And the sullen land has nought
1936,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"But the freedom of its thought,"
1937,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Of its thought that hopes and hates
1938,SWORD AND SICKLE.,And from year to year awaits.
1939,SWORD AND SICKLE.,
1940,SWORD AND SICKLE.,And what of thee upon whose head
1941,SWORD AND SICKLE.,All evil’s phials have been shed--
1942,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Thou whom those who now have gotten
1943,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Their own freedom, have forgotten--"
1944,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Thou whose name is never heard,"
1945,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Thou whose hope is aye deferred,"
1946,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Thou whose tongue thy foes outroot,"
1947,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Thou whose sons they chain and shoot--
1948,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Poland, heiress of the knout?"
1949,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Lo, the century grows old"
1950,SWORD AND SICKLE.,And thy hour has not yet tolled.
1951,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"On thy form benumbed and bruised,"
1952,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Whence the life-blood half has oozed,"
1953,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Lies the dark Colossus still
1954,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Whom his own sons now would kill--
1955,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Tormentors that like vipers start
1956,SWORD AND SICKLE.,From his huge frame’s every part;
1957,SWORD AND SICKLE.,But he holds thee all the tighter
1958,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"While thy bloodless face grows whiter,"
1959,SWORD AND SICKLE.,And his limbs that on thee weigh
1960,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Grow more rotten day by day.
1961,SWORD AND SICKLE.,
1962,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Hark! I hear a muffled sound
1963,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Deep beneath the frozen ground
1964,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Where a buried Poland pines
1965,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"In the dark Siberian mines,"
1966,SWORD AND SICKLE.,In the sunless vaults that ape
1967,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Those of Hell in gloom and shape,"
1968,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Where the gangs who death await
1969,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Unlearn to think, but not to hate:"
1970,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Is’t a growl of joy that runs
1971,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Where are chained half Poland’s sons?
1972,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Ay, a growl of joy it is"
1973,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"To each mine’s extremities,"
1974,SWORD AND SICKLE.,And for once Despair has laughed
1975,SWORD AND SICKLE.,In each black pestiferous shaft:
1976,SWORD AND SICKLE.,He who sent them there lies dead
1977,SWORD AND SICKLE.,On his gory Imperial bed--
1978,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"He who made them walk in chains,"
1979,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"In long goaded staggering trains,"
1980,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Through the endless snow-clad plains
1981,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"To the grave in which they lie,"
1982,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Not yet dead, but soon to die:"
1983,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"Even he has found his hour,"
1984,SWORD AND SICKLE.,Murdered in his boundless power
1985,SWORD AND SICKLE.,"By his own, and rots in death"

1992,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,
1993,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,
1994,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"The old red, towered walls climb round the hills"
1995,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"On which Siena stands in lonely state,"
1996,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Scanning the ridgy plain, where gleam no rills"
1997,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"And loom no towns, but only endless lines"
1998,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Of livid furrowed hillocks which the great
1999,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"White, ploughing bullocks speck. From gate to gate"
2000,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,A few tall cypresses and scattered pines
2001,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Climb too, where, guarding streets that silence fills,"
2002,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"The old red, towered walls climb round the hills."
2003,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,
2004,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Silent and empty in the August glare
2005,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,The old depopulated city sleeps;
2006,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Its dizzy belfry climbs the fiery air
2007,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Into the sky’s inexorable blue;
2008,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Across its great scooped shell-shaped square there creeps
2009,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"No living soul, nor up the high paved steeps"
2010,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,That be its streets; perhaps some carts sway through
2011,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Its dusty gates, behind a huge-horned pair,"
2012,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Creaking and empty in the August glare.
2013,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,
2014,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"O for the pageantry of olden days,"
2015,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Thou silent square--ye palaces that wind
2016,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Up to the still cathedral, where the rays,"
2017,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Now gentler, kiss the marble and the gold!"
2018,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"O for the throngs that Time has left behind,"
2019,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Ye buttressed lanes, ye lofty archways lined"
2020,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,With faded saints; show those ye used to hold
2021,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,When the strong prosperous city loved displays
2022,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,And gaudy pageantry in olden days.
2023,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,
2024,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"I hear a hum of men, a tramp and tread;"
2025,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,The city’s Districts muster. First appears
2026,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,The District of the Panther--white and red
2027,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Its men-at-arms and pages, fifes and drums;"
2028,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,And next the yellow-liveried troop that bears
2029,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,The Ghibelline standard of the Eagle nears;
2030,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Then Tortoise, Hedgehog, Snail and Glowworm come;"
2031,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"And the Guelf She-Wolf, with her arms ahead"
2032,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"All black and silver, comes with tramp and tread."
2033,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,
2034,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"The Districts muster for the August race,"
2035,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"And take their glossy racers to be blessed,"
2036,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Each in its own rich church, where, held in trace"
2037,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Of gold, the startled barb with hoof-steps loud"
2038,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Is led through flaunting banner, shield and crest"
2039,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"To the high altar’s rail, where kneel close pressed"
2040,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"The pages and the soldiers and the crowd,"
2041,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Who scan the gleaming limbs that shall efface
2042,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Last year’s defeat and win the August race.
2043,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,
2044,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"The huge old square scooped like a palmer’s shell,"
2045,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Siena’s forum and its hippodrome,"
2046,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Echoes a roar that drowns the mighty bell
2047,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,From battlemented belfry in the sky;
2048,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"The ring of olden palaces, become"
2049,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Ablaze with crimson hangings, looks like some"
2050,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Enchanted Coliseum, in which vie"
2051,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Scutcheon and standard; so you scarce could tell
2052,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,The strange old square scooped like a palmer’s shell.
2053,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,
2054,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,In bright procession ere the race is run
2055,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"The rival Districts wind around the course,"
2056,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Each with its banner in the evening sun,"
2057,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Its clarions, and its Captain capped with steel,"
2058,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Its pages and its men that lead the horse
2059,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Caparisoned and guarded by a force
2060,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Of gaudy pikemen; while the clarions peal
2061,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,And the crowd cheers the Panther that has won
2062,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Its fickle favour ere the race is run.
2063,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,
2064,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,And as the standard-bearers one and all
2065,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"March by in motley blazonry, they cast"
2066,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Their standards high in air, and as they fall"
2067,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Catch them above the throng with rapid hand
2068,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,And twirl and twist them dexterously and fast
2069,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"In one unceasing play, until at last"
2070,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"The whole vast square is by the bright silk fanned,"
2071,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,And they have marched before the great Town Hall
2072,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Where stand the city’s rulers one and all.
2073,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,
2074,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Then comes, drawn by six bullocks of huge size"
2075,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"All white as milk, with many-coloured strings"
2076,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"About their horns, broad brows and large black eyes,"
2077,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"The old Republic’s standard-bearing wain,"
2078,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,With its great Martinella bell that rings
2079,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Oft o’er the battle’s roar, and whose sound brings"
2080,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Fear to the heart of her who plots in vain,"
2081,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Perfidious Florence. From its high mast flies
2082,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Siena’s She-Wolf’s standard of huge size.
2083,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,
2084,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"And now the course is clear, and those who don"
2085,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,The colours of the Panther feel no fear;
2086,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,A hundred thousand partizans look on
2087,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"With inborn urban rivalry, and hail"
2088,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"The horses one by one as they appear,"
2089,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"And hoot the Shell, or Wave, or wildly cheer"
2090,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"The Hedgehog, or the Dragon, or the Snail,"
2091,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Or the great Eagle that so oft has won,"
2092,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Whose knaves and rider yellow colours don.
2093,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,
2094,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"At last they start, and at terrific pace"
2095,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"In dreadful crush adown the slope they tear,"
2096,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,The Tortoise leading for a little space;
2097,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Then from the crowd the Panther shooting out,"
2098,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Maintains the lead thrice round the perilous square;
2099,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Then suddenly a great shout rends the air:
2100,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,“The Snail! The Snail!” all cry; and in hushed doubt
2101,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"All watch the two. The Snail has won the race,"
2102,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,And slowly slackens its terrific pace.
2103,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,
2104,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,And in the District of the Snail to-night
2105,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Is revelry and feasting in the street;
2106,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,From great wrought-iron torch-holders the light
2107,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Falls red and flaring on grim palace walls
2108,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Decked with bright banners; boards where all may eat
2109,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,"Who care, are crowded; while the old repeat"
2110,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Many an oft-told story that recalls
2111,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,What things the Snail had done in race and fight.
2112,A PAGEANT OF SIENA.,Sleep shuns the District of the Snail to-night.

2121,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,For do not men in presence of some score
2122,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Too great for payment constantly prefer
2123,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Quick death to base insolvency, and spur"
2124,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,A trembling self across life’s brink. And yet
2125,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,They owe but gold--perhaps a paltry debt
2126,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"To some vile Jew; while I, alas, alas!"
2127,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Owe all mankind a thing which did surpass
2128,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,All other treasures; a grand peerless thing
2129,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Beyond all pricing and all wondering,"
2130,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Which should be man’s, but which to save my own"

2132,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"To be long months, and months to be long years;"

2136,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Of utter helplessness! But I have now
2137,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,To tell the fatal tale of when and how
2138,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"I lost it for the world, and not to speak"
2139,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Of these sad days when conscience loves to wreak
2140,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Her retribution on me in such vast
2141,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And unremitting anguish.
2142,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,
2143,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,I had passed
2144,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Six idle years since taking my degree,"
2145,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,When I fell in at Athens casually
2146,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"With one called Richard Strongclyffe, who had been"
2147,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"My college friend, but whom I had not seen"
2148,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Since then, and who meanwhile had made a name"
2149,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Through study of Greek Art. We soon became
2150,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,As intimate as of old; and as no claim
2151,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Of work or pleasure summoned me elsewhere,"
2152,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"He let me roam through Greece with him, and share"
2153,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,His own strong daily life--the sheer reverse
2154,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Of my accustomed life of waste, and worse"
2155,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Than waste, the aimless life of which my soul"
2156,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Was more than sick; it had become so foul.
2157,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,He had an iron will; his hand was rough;
2158,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,His heart was gentle. God had used strong stuff
2159,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,In making him--weak stuff in making me.
2160,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And yet I was not worthless utterly.
2161,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Spite all my sins there were some better strings
2162,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,In my weak heart; the wind of angels’ wings
2163,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Made them vibrate--but with faint echo, like"
2164,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Æolian chords that gusts too fitful strike.
2165,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Mine is a double nature, which depends"
2166,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Wholly on its surroundings, and which blends"
2167,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"With good or evil, with the low or high,"
2168,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,With the same drifting weak facility.
2169,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,In Strongclyffe’s hands my nature’s worthier side
2170,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Alone found vent; pure tastes that had not died
2171,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Grew strong, while half-forgotten culture found"
2172,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"A sudden use, and from all things around"
2173,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Increased its wealth. I think that he enjoyed
2174,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,His power over me; his strong soul toyed
2175,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"With my soft malleable mind, which had,"
2176,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"In spite of degradations many and sad,"
2177,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Affinities of taste, and could admire"
2178,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And understand him. Oh what strength and fire
2179,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Beneath his quiet ways! What scorn could burst
2180,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,From his cold lip! what ceaseless ceaseless thirst
2181,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,He had for knowledge! Even as my mind
2182,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Grew intimate with his, new worlds defined"
2183,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Their shape on my horizon, like the grey"
2184,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Faint, shadowy Greek Isles which far away"
2185,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Loomed through the mists of dawn, but which became,"
2186,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"As we approached them in the sunrise flame,"
2187,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Each minute more distinct.
2188,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,
2189,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,We seldom stayed
2190,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Long in one self-same spot; but we obeyed
2191,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"The needs of Strongclyffe’s studies, which entailed"
2192,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Research in many places; and we sailed
2193,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"From isle to isle, or rode from place to place,"
2194,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Now in the less-known parts of Greece and Thrace,"
2195,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"And now in rocky Lydia. Oh, what fields"
2196,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Where men dig gold, what far Golconda yields"
2197,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Such wealth, such gems, as those impoverished plains"
2198,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,In which the spade turns up the scant remains
2199,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Of bygone genius; where the obedient earth,"
2200,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Summoned to yield her buried dead, gives birth,"
2201,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"As if compelled by an enchanter’s rod,"
2202,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,To what is ever young--now to some god
2203,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"In all his strength and beauty, now to some"
2204,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Fantastic child of Pan, who seems fresh come"
2205,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,From dewy woods that long have ceased to be?
2206,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And Strongclyffe had the art to make one see
2207,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The hidden through the seen--to reconstruct
2208,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Past life and loveliness, and to conduct"
2209,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The mind through perished worlds; and everywhere
2210,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,He showed the same keen interest and a rare
2211,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Persistence of research. Yet what he did
2212,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Seemed somehow trifling; oft I thought it hid
2213,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Higher preoccupation--some great aim
2214,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Which time was ripening; so that when there came
2215,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,One day a sudden change in him--when all
2216,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Was thrown aside, and when I heard him call"
2217,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Upon my help, with triumph on his lips,"
2218,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,In a great enterprise which should eclipse
2219,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Even the greatest, I received his words"
2220,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Not wholly unprepared.
2221,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,
2222,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,How my heart’s chords
2223,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Vibrate as I recall them! ’Twas about
2224,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The third year’s close; and we were sitting out
2225,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Upon our terrace looking on the sea
2226,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"At Thyna, after sundown. Purposely,"
2227,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"As I now fancy, Strongclyffe had led on"
2228,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Our idle talk to what might yet be won
2229,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Back by mankind, of the great wreck we call"
2230,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Antiquity; and then we talked of all
2231,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,That splendid half of antique art which must
2232,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,From the materials used have turned to dust
2233,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Almost as soon as did the artist’s hands.
2234,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Where be thy works, Apelles? where now stands,"
2235,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Phidias, thy gold and ivory gems, renowned"
2236,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Through the broad world? and where stands she who owned
2237,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"As her fit seat the new-born Parthenon,"
2238,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Thy gold and ivory Pallas? What would man
2239,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Not give to-day if only he could scan
2240,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,In one short glimpse the splendour of that shape
2241,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Which Fancy’s restorations vainly ape,"
2242,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,If he for one short minute could behold
2243,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"That ivory face, that drapery of gold"
2244,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,As Phidias modelled it?
2245,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,
2246,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"“And yet,” I said,"
2247,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,“That Art was not so frail; for I have read
2248,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"That that same effigy of Pallas, spared"
2249,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"From age to age, existed unimpaired"
2250,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Till the Crusaders, under Baldwin, took"
2251,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And sacked Constantinople.”
2252,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,
2253,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,A strange look
2254,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Flashed out from Strongclyffe’s eyes. “There is no truth
2255,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"In that old tale,” he answered; “and Time’s tooth"
2256,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Still spared the statue when it many a year
2257,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Had gnawed the bones of Baldwin in his bier,"
2258,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Ay, and of Baldwin’s sons.”"
2259,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,
2260,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,“How know you that?”
2261,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,I asked.
2262,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,
2263,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"He left the bench on which we sat,"
2264,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And with a strange excitement he began
2265,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"To pace the terrace. “I am not the man,”"
2266,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"He cried, “to make rash statements; yet I say"
2267,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Deliberately, Percy, that to-day"
2268,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"That Pallas still exists. Oh, Earth has still"
2269,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Surprises for mankind; and with God’s will
2270,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"And patient work, the world shall see her yet!"
2271,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Think not that I am mad: wait till I set
2272,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,My proofs before your eyes. When you behold
2273,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"The text in John Ionides, the old"
2274,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Byzantine Chronicler, which had defied"
2275,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"All guesses to this day, and by its side"
2276,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,A certain passage in the life of Paul
2277,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Of Trebizond--and when you’ve counted all
2278,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The links of evidence which year by year
2279,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"I have augmented both at home and here,"
2280,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Until I now have found the very spot--
2281,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Then call me mad. ’Tis years since I have got
2282,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The certainty that long ere Baldwin’s sack
2283,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"The Emperor, in fear of some attack"
2284,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Upon the palace, had her safe conveyed"
2285,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"By vessel to a distance, and (by aid"
2286,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Of trusty workmen) carefully concealed
2287,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,In crypts beneath a temple. Nought revealed
2288,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The secret at the time; the Emperor died
2289,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Soon after; and, none caring to unhide"
2290,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"The statue, men forgot her. But where lay"
2291,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The temple--or the ruins which to-day
2292,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,No doubt replace it? Here I seemed to lose
2293,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,My way and reach mere nothing. All my clues
2294,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Led to one spot--Thelopis; and that spot,"
2295,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"In spite of all my search, I found it not."
2296,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Oh, with what patience in these three long years"
2297,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Have I not sought! Oh, with what hopes and fears"
2298,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Have I not searched the present and the past
2299,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,To find that place Thelopis! And at last
2300,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"I have found out. Thelopis was a town,"
2301,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"If town it could be called, that was burnt down"
2302,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Ten centuries ago, and where has grown"
2303,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The present village Thos--the place that is
2304,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Nearest the temple of Peripolis:
2305,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"The temple is Peripolis. And see,"
2306,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The distance and direction both agree:
2307,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"The passage says, ‘a five days’ eastward sail,"
2308,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And then three days of road.’ No clues now fail;
2309,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"There under Peripolis, girt round"
2310,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"By solitude and silence, will be found"
2311,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"The gold and ivory Pallas. Oh, I know"
2312,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,That you will answer that she long ago
2313,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Must have become mere shapeless mouldering dust--
2314,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,That after seven centuries she must
2315,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Have blent with earth; and yet I say she stands
2316,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,As grand and splendid as when all Greek lands
2317,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,First hailed her beauty! Do you think that they
2318,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Who used such pains, in safety to convey"
2319,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"And hide her in that distant spot, would spare"
2320,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The slight pains needed to exclude the air
2321,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And ward away the damp? Again I say
2322,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,She lives--she lives!”
2323,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,
2324,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And so the following day
2325,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,We started for Peripolis--a long
2326,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And arduous journey; for it lies among
2327,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Wild unfrequented mountains, in a small"
2328,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And fever-stricken plain. The hills are all
2329,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Possessed by tribes which, though uncouth and wild,"
2330,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Are not unfriendly. When you once have toiled
2331,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Through the last defiles, and behold the lone"
2332,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Still distant ruins below you, that seem thrown"
2333,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"There to die slow, like those whom in its haste"
2334,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"A routed host abandons in the waste,"
2335,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"There creeps across your soul a sort of fear,"
2336,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,A sense of isolation such as ne’er
2337,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Has filled your heart. The broken columns throw
2338,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Their shadows on bare shingle; nought will grow
2339,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,For miles around save thin scorched grass that feeds
2340,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"A few lean goats, and some few clumps of reeds"
2341,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Where there is water. Oh, the tract around"
2342,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Speaks utter desolation; and we found
2343,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The task not easy even to collect
2344,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The workmen we required. The heaps of wrecked
2345,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And weed-grown marble where the spade was tried
2346,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Had more than once been searched, and seemed to hide"
2347,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Nought worth men’s pains--at most some shattered bit
2348,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Of Greco-Roman sculpture; but we lit
2349,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,On some strange crypts; and in a few more days
2350,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,We had discovered a bewildering maze
2351,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Of subterranean chambers, large and small,"
2352,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"And catacomb-like passages, which all"
2353,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Were cut in soft dry stone, and stretched away"
2354,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Far underground, beyond the ruins that lay"
2355,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,In the sun’s light; and all were wholly bare.
2356,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Strongclyffe at once, pretending not to care"
2357,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"For empty crypts, employed the men elsewhere;"
2358,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"While he and I, by torch-light and alone,"
2359,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Explored the maze. But sometimes, as loose stone"
2360,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Obstructed here and there the way, we had"
2361,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,A boy to help--a dull half-witted lad
2362,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Of whom we felt no fear. For days we sought
2363,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"With boundless care, but all our searching brought"
2364,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Nothing to light; we sounded every wall,"
2365,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,We grew familiar with each inch of all
2366,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The lonely crypts; and even Strongclyffe seemed
2367,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,To grow depressed. But suddenly there gleamed
2368,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Fresh ardour in his eyes: “Look there!” he said,"
2369,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And showed me something like an arrow’s head
2370,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Cut in the wall; a small, scarce visible mark"
2371,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Which led to others like it through the dark
2372,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Perplexing crypt; and where the last marks were
2373,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"We scrutinized the wall with greater care,"
2374,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"And found its surface rougher, as if there"
2375,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"It had been tampered with. “This is the spot,”"
2376,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,He whispered. “She is here;” and having got
2377,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"A pick, he struck. And as, beneath the stroke"
2378,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Of Vulcan’s hammer once, the aching brow"
2379,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Of Zeus was cleft for Pallas’ birth, so now"
2380,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The stricken cloven stone exposed to sight
2381,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The long-sought Goddess; and the flickering light
2382,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Of the red torch flashed in a tremulous flood
2383,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Upon her golden breastplate as she stood
2384,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Intact, in all the glory and the glow"
2385,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Of her incomparable beauty.
2386,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,
2387,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,So
2388,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Was she discovered; I must now compel
2389,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,My weak and miserable self to tell
2390,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"How she was lost. There was no time to lose,"
2391,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"And we agreed, or rather Strongclyffe chose"
2392,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,That he should start at once for the chief town
2393,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Of that wild province, as he long had known"
2394,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"The there commanding Pasha, to obtain"
2395,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,A guard of men; while I was to remain
2396,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,To watch the workmen. He was to be back
2397,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Within three days. Alas! I had no lack
2398,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Of buoyant thoughts at first; my soul was filled
2399,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,With our immense success; my nerves still thrilled
2400,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,With triumph and delight; and the first day
2401,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Of Strongclyffe’s absence lightly passed away.
2402,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"The men worked on as usual, and my mind"
2403,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Conceived no fear. But when the sun declined
2404,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"There crept across my spirit, with the tide"
2405,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Of slowly creeping shadow as day died,"
2406,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,A vague uneasiness; and my hands felt
2407,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"For the revolver hanging at my belt,"
2408,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,I thought; and I remembered that when we
2409,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Had found the prize, we were not two but three."
2410,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The boy had seen the whole; and though I knew
2411,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,That he was dull of wit and had no clue
2412,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,To find the spot again in that vast maze
2413,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Of hidden crypts and subterranean ways,"
2414,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,I wished he had not seen. The men had gone
2415,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Back to their distant huts. I sat alone
2416,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Upon a broken column; one by one
2417,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The large stars twinkled forth from out the blue;
2418,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"The shattered standing columns dusky grew,"
2419,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And very solemn; and the wakening bat
2420,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Began to flit around me. As I sat,"
2421,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,I thought of Strongclyffe’s generosity;
2422,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"How he had said ere setting out that I,"
2423,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"His faithful friend, must have an equal share"
2424,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,In the world’s praise; that it would not be fair
2425,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,That I----
2426,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,
2427,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,O God!
2428,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,
2429,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,I gave a strangled shout
2430,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"And fell, dragged backwards by a noose about"
2431,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,My throat. Three men were kneeling on my chest
2432,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Binding me tight with cords, while others pressed"
2433,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"All round about me, uttering no sound"
2434,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,As if all dumb. When I was firmly bound
2435,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"All save my feet, which, purposely let loose"
2436,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"To let me walk, were in a running noose,"
2437,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,One of the men addressed me: “Listen well
2438,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"To what I say,” he said. “If you rebel"
2439,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,We take your life; and none can help you now.
2440,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,We have no wish to harm you; but we know
2441,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"That you have found a treasure, and have got"
2442,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The clue. Lead on.”
2443,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,
2444,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"“I understand you not,”"
2445,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,I said.
2446,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,He took a pistol from his sash
2447,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"And held it at my ear. “Come, be not rash,”"
2448,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"He said, “but lead the way.” Oh, would to God"
2449,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,That he had fired! But though like a mere clod
2450,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"I still moved not, he did not fire, but placed"
2451,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Once more the gleaming pistol in his waist,"
2452,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And whispered with the others; then they drew
2453,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"The cords still tighter round my limbs, and threw"
2454,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,My unresisting body on the bed
2455,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"In my own hut hard by. “Mark well,” they said,"
2456,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,“Ere dawn we come. Thy blood be on thy head!”
2457,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,
2458,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"At first I had no thoughts, nought but the sense"
2459,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Of cramped and swelling limbs, and an intense"
2460,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Desire to burst my bonds. But by-and-by
2461,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,A sense of infinite calamity
2462,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Began to weigh upon me; and at last,"
2463,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"The sense came home that time was slipping fast,"
2464,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,That I was there to make an awful choice
2465,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,’Twixt Life and Death; and then an inner voice
2466,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Began to state the argument each way,"
2467,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Not clearly, coldly, as I may to-day"
2468,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Do in this letter, but confused, close-pressed,"
2469,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Repeated and repeated in my breast
2470,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"In every shape, until my weary brain,"
2471,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Exhausted by the conflict and the pain,"
2472,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Yielded to sleep. And even in my sleep
2473,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The struggle still went on; I felt it keep
2474,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Possession of my dreams, and take the shape"
2475,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Of shifting nightmare, leaving no escape."
2476,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"I saw the glorious Pallas, calm no more,"
2477,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"But threatening and terrific, kneeling o’er"
2478,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"My prostrate body, with red eyes that gleamed"
2479,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"So fiery in the darkness, that it seemed"
2480,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,As if one of the Furies had put on
2481,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Her golden panoply. Then, wild and wan,"
2482,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,I saw the face of Strongclyffe looming out
2483,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,From a black whirling gulf; and heard him shout
2484,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Like some spent swimmer half sucked down.
2485,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And there
2486,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"I think I woke, and with a vague despair"
2487,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Resumed the pleadings of each adverse side;
2488,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"While, ever louder, something in me cried:"
2489,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"“Choose death, choose death! in fifty years from this,"
2490,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,When thou art swallowed in the dark abyss
2491,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Of Time, what will it be to thee or thine"
2492,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Whether thou diedst to-day at twenty-nine,"
2493,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Or knew’st old age? But man whom Time devours
2494,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Not, and who lives by centuries, not hours,"
2495,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Will be possessed of one transcendent gift,"
2496,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,To add to his small store of things that lift
2497,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The soul to higher spheres--a gift from which
2498,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Will flow perennial charm for poor and rich,"
2499,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,For young and old. If but mankind could know
2500,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"That some great treasure lost long, long ago--"
2501,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"A famed Greek play, for instance--had been lost"
2502,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Because a certain man had grudged the cost
2503,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Of his brief life to save it, that man’s name,"
2504,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"For ever handed down in scorn and shame,"
2505,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Would be all nations’ by-word. Who can say
2506,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,That some great work which man enjoys to-day--
2507,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"The Melos statue, Hamlet or Macbeth,"
2508,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Or the Gioconda--was not saved from death,"
2509,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"In some great unknown peril that it ran,"
2510,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"By some unknown, unthanked and nameless man"
2511,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Who gave his life instead? And then, in place"
2512,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Of something rarer yet, wouldst have the face"
2513,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,To give the world thy mean half-wasted life
2514,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"With which it can do nought? Thou hast no wife,"
2515,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"No child to need thy care. Choose death, choose death,"
2516,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,While yet ’tis time!”
2517,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,
2518,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,But oh the pleasant breath
2519,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Of life; the strong, strong stream of youth and health"
2520,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,That bounds along the veins; the unused wealth
2521,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Of what we call the Future, with its schemes,"
2522,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Emotions, friendships, loves, surprises, dreams;"
2523,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"The thing we call Identity, the I"
2524,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"To which the wretched cling, they know not why,"
2525,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And which no evils press me to destroy;
2526,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The simple pleasures which I now enjoy--
2527,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"What, give up all? What right has Fate, what right,"
2528,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"To thrust me from Life’s hearth into the night,"
2529,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The darkness and the cold? What right or need
2530,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Has Fate to come, and while I sit and read"
2531,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Life’s pleasant page, to summon me to shut"
2532,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"The open book, and leave two thirds uncut?"
2533,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Who dares to tell me that a living man
2534,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Whom God has made, who feels the cool winds fan"
2535,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"His heated brow, is not in God’s sight worth"
2536,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"A thing that is man’s work, upon this earth?"
2537,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,My life is mended now; each passing day
2538,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Now rolls, though idly, harmlessly away."
2539,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"The bright green fields, the flowers and the trees,"
2540,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"The rippling streams, the sun, the passing breeze,"
2541,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The million things that in their life rejoice
2542,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"And gladden mine, call out with mighty voice,"
2543,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"“Choose life, choose life!”"
2544,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,
2545,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"And when at dawn they came,"
2546,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And bade me show the spot--O shame! O shame!
2547,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"I nodded an assent. Oh let me now,"
2548,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"With shame’s familiar brand upon my brow,"
2549,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"For once spare my base self, and hurry by"
2550,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Those monstrous minutes! Slowly, silently,"
2551,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,I led them to the spot. I saw their eyes
2552,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,With excusable rapture scan the prize
2553,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,To which their souls were dead. I saw them take
2554,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Their hatchets in their impious hands, and break"
2555,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Into small fragments hideous to behold,"
2556,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"And shapeless dust of ivory and of gold,"
2557,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,The beauty which the world would have despaired
2558,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"To match, and twenty centuries had spared"
2559,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"In vain--in vain! Awhile, I think, I heard"
2560,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Ferocious wrangling, oath and threatening word"
2561,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Over the booty; but my sickened brain
2562,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Took little note. And when I sought again
2563,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"To see and hear and think, all sounds had ceased;"
2564,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"I was alone, and free."
2565,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,

2569,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Leaving a letter; and in guilt and fear,"
2570,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Just like a thief, stole back to England here,"
2571,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Alone with my incomparable debt.
2572,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,He never saw me more; although we met
2573,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"In these o’er-crowded London streets one day,"
2574,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,And oh how changed he was--how old and grey
2575,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"He had become, though scarce two years had passed"
2576,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Over his head since I had seen him last!
2577,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"He saw me not, but passed with vacant eye;"
2578,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"While I, as if to vanish bodily"
2579,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Into the solid stones, shrank to the wall."
2580,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"He now is dead--and I? Oh, does not all"

2583,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,For having chosen life? What use--what good
2584,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,Have I been to mankind since first I stood
2585,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,So fatally and wholly in its debt?
2586,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,What drops of compensation have I yet
2587,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Wrung out of my weak worthless self, and cast"
2588,THE WONDER OF THE WORLD.,"Into the deep abyss? Oh, I have passed"

2607,IPSISSIMUS.,"Of this confessional, give ear:"
2608,IPSISSIMUS.,"I need God’s help, for I have seen"
2609,IPSISSIMUS.,What turns my vitals limp with fear.
2610,IPSISSIMUS.,"O Christ, O Christ, I must have done"
2611,IPSISSIMUS.,More mortal sin than anyone
2612,IPSISSIMUS.,Who says his prayers in Venice here!
2613,IPSISSIMUS.,
2614,IPSISSIMUS.,And yet by stealth I only tried
2615,IPSISSIMUS.,"To kill my enemy, God knows;"
2616,IPSISSIMUS.,And who on earth has e’er denied
2617,IPSISSIMUS.,A man the right to kill his foes?
2618,IPSISSIMUS.,He won the race of the Gondoliers;
2619,IPSISSIMUS.,I hate him and the skin he wears--
2620,IPSISSIMUS.,I hate him and the shade he throws.
2621,IPSISSIMUS.,
2622,IPSISSIMUS.,I hate him through each day and hour;
2623,IPSISSIMUS.,All ills that curse me seem his fault:
2624,IPSISSIMUS.,"He makes my daily soup taste sour,"
2625,IPSISSIMUS.,He makes my daily bread taste salt;
2626,IPSISSIMUS.,And so I hung upon his track
2627,IPSISSIMUS.,At dusk to stab him in the back
2628,IPSISSIMUS.,In some lone street or archway vault.
2629,IPSISSIMUS.,
2630,IPSISSIMUS.,But oh give heed! As I was stealing
2631,IPSISSIMUS.,"Upon his heels, with knife grasped tight,"
2632,IPSISSIMUS.,There crept across my soul a feeling
2633,IPSISSIMUS.,That I myself was kept in sight;
2634,IPSISSIMUS.,"Each time I turned, dodge as I would,"
2635,IPSISSIMUS.,A masked and unknown watcher stood
2636,IPSISSIMUS.,Who baffled all my plan that night.
2637,IPSISSIMUS.,
2638,IPSISSIMUS.,"What mask is this, I thought and thought,"
2639,IPSISSIMUS.,Who dogs me thus when least I care?
2640,IPSISSIMUS.,"His figure is nor tall nor short,"
2641,IPSISSIMUS.,And yet has a familiar air.
2642,IPSISSIMUS.,"But oh, despite this watcher’s eye,"
2643,IPSISSIMUS.,"I’ll reach my man yet by-and-by,"
2644,IPSISSIMUS.,"And snuff his life out yet, elsewhere."
2645,IPSISSIMUS.,
2646,IPSISSIMUS.,"And though compelled to still defer,"
2647,IPSISSIMUS.,I schemed another project soon;
2648,IPSISSIMUS.,I armed my boat with a hidden spur
2649,IPSISSIMUS.,To run him down in the lagoon.
2650,IPSISSIMUS.,At dusk I saw him row one day
2651,IPSISSIMUS.,"Where lone and wide the waters lay,"
2652,IPSISSIMUS.,Reflecting scarce the dim white moon.
2653,IPSISSIMUS.,
2654,IPSISSIMUS.,"No boat, as far as sight could strain,"
2655,IPSISSIMUS.,Loomed on the solitary sea;
2656,IPSISSIMUS.,I saw my oar each minute gain
2657,IPSISSIMUS.,"Upon my death-doomed enemy,"
2658,IPSISSIMUS.,"When lo, a black-masked gondolier,"
2659,IPSISSIMUS.,"Silent and spectre-like, drew near,"
2660,IPSISSIMUS.,And stepped between my deed and me.
2661,IPSISSIMUS.,
2662,IPSISSIMUS.,"He seemed from out the flood to rise,"
2663,IPSISSIMUS.,And hovered near to mar my game;
2664,IPSISSIMUS.,"I knew him and his cursed guise,"
2665,IPSISSIMUS.,His cursed mask: he was the same.
2666,IPSISSIMUS.,"So, balked once more, enraged and cowed,"
2667,IPSISSIMUS.,Back through the still lagoon I rowed
2668,IPSISSIMUS.,"In mingled wonder, wrath, and shame."
2669,IPSISSIMUS.,
2670,IPSISSIMUS.,"Oh, were I not to come and pray"
2671,IPSISSIMUS.,Thee for thy absolution here
2672,IPSISSIMUS.,"In the Confessional, to-day"
2673,IPSISSIMUS.,My very ribs would burst with fear.
2674,IPSISSIMUS.,"Leave not, good Father, in the lurch"
2675,IPSISSIMUS.,"A faithful son of Mother Church,"
2676,IPSISSIMUS.,Whose faith is firm and soul sincere.
2677,IPSISSIMUS.,
2678,IPSISSIMUS.,"Behind St. Luke’s, as the dead men know,"
2679,IPSISSIMUS.,"A pale apothecary dwells,"
2680,IPSISSIMUS.,"Who deals in death both quick and slow,"
2681,IPSISSIMUS.,"And baleful philters, withering spells;"
2682,IPSISSIMUS.,"He sells alike to rich and poor,"
2683,IPSISSIMUS.,"Who know what knocks to give his door,"
2684,IPSISSIMUS.,The yellow dust that rings the knells.
2685,IPSISSIMUS.,
2686,IPSISSIMUS.,"Well, then, I went and knocked the knock"
2687,IPSISSIMUS.,"With cautious hand, as I’d been taught;"
2688,IPSISSIMUS.,"The door revolved with silent lock,"
2689,IPSISSIMUS.,"And I went in, suspecting nought."
2690,IPSISSIMUS.,"But oh, the self-same form stood masked"
2691,IPSISSIMUS.,"Behind the counter, and unasked"
2692,IPSISSIMUS.,In silence proffered what I sought.
2693,IPSISSIMUS.,
2694,IPSISSIMUS.,My knees and hands like aspens shook:
2695,IPSISSIMUS.,I spilt the powder on the ground;
2696,IPSISSIMUS.,"I dared not turn, I dared not look;"
2697,IPSISSIMUS.,My palsied tongue would make no sound.
2698,IPSISSIMUS.,Then through the door I fled at last
2699,IPSISSIMUS.,"With feet that seemed more slow than fast,"
2700,IPSISSIMUS.,And dared not even once look round.
2701,IPSISSIMUS.,
2702,IPSISSIMUS.,And yet I am an honest man
2703,IPSISSIMUS.,Who only sought to kill his foe:
2704,IPSISSIMUS.,Could I sit down to see each plan
2705,IPSISSIMUS.,"That I took up frustrated so,"
2706,IPSISSIMUS.,"When as each plan was marred and balked,"
2707,IPSISSIMUS.,"And in the sun my man still walked,"
2708,IPSISSIMUS.,I felt my hate still greater grow?
2709,IPSISSIMUS.,
2710,IPSISSIMUS.,"I thought, “At dusk with stealthy tread"
2711,IPSISSIMUS.,"I’ll seek his dwelling, and I’ll creep"
2712,IPSISSIMUS.,"Upstairs and hide beneath his bed,"
2713,IPSISSIMUS.,And in the night I’ll strike him deep.”
2714,IPSISSIMUS.,And so I went; but at his door
2715,IPSISSIMUS.,"The figure, masked just as before,"
2716,IPSISSIMUS.,Sat on the step as if asleep.
2717,IPSISSIMUS.,
2718,IPSISSIMUS.,"Bent, spite all fear, upon my task,"
2719,IPSISSIMUS.,I tried to pass: there was no space.
2720,IPSISSIMUS.,Then rage prevailed; I snatched the mask
2721,IPSISSIMUS.,"From off the baffling figure’s face,"
2722,IPSISSIMUS.,"And oh, unutterable dread!"
2723,IPSISSIMUS.,"The face was mine, mine white and dead,"
2724,IPSISSIMUS.,Stiff with some frightful death’s grimace.
2725,IPSISSIMUS.,
2726,IPSISSIMUS.,"What sins are mine, O luckless wight,"
2727,IPSISSIMUS.,That doom should play me such a trick
2728,IPSISSIMUS.,And make me see a sudden sight
2729,IPSISSIMUS.,That turns both soul and body sick?
2730,IPSISSIMUS.,"Stretch out thy hands, thou priest unseen"
2731,IPSISSIMUS.,"That sittest there behind the screen,"
2732,IPSISSIMUS.,"And give me absolution, quick!"
2733,IPSISSIMUS.,
2734,IPSISSIMUS.,"O God, O God, his hands are dead!"
2735,IPSISSIMUS.,"His hands are mine, O monstrous spell!"
2736,IPSISSIMUS.,I feel them clammy on my head.
2737,IPSISSIMUS.,Is he my own dead self as well?
2738,IPSISSIMUS.,"Those hands are mine--their scars, their shape:"
2739,IPSISSIMUS.,"O God, O God, there’s no escape,"
2740,IPSISSIMUS.,"And seeking Heaven, I fall on Hell!"

3332,_BY THE SAME AUTHOR._,"may be called psychography, of drawing the landscape of moods with"
3333,_BY THE SAME AUTHOR._,"atmosphere and environment suitable and complete, that Mr."
