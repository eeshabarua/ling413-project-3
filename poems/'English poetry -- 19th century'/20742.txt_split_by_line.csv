94,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,
95,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,
96,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,{At Aerschot up leaped of a sudden the Sun: p1.jpg}
97,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,
98,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"I sprang to the stirrup, and Joris and he:"
99,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three;"
100,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"""Good speed!"" cried the watch as the gate-bolts undrew,"
101,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"""Speed!"" echoed the wall to us galloping through."
102,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,"
103,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,And into the midnight we galloped abreast.
104,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,
105,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace--
106,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place;"
107,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,"
108,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"Then shortened each stirrup and set the pique right,"
109,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"Rebuckled the check-strap, chained slacker the bit,"
110,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.
111,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,
112,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,'Twas moonset at starting; but while we drew near
113,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"Lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear;"
114,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,At Boom a great yellow star came out to see;
115,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,At Duffeld 'twas morning as plain as could be;
116,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,And from Mecheln church-steeple we heard the half-chime--
117,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"So Joris broke silence with ""Yet there is time!"""
118,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,
119,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"At Aerschot up leaped of a sudden the sun,"
120,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"And against him the cattle stood black every one,"
121,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,To stare through the mist at us galloping past;
122,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last
123,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"With resolute shoulders, each butting away"
124,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray;"
125,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,
126,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back"
127,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track,"
128,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,And one eye's black intelligence--ever that glance
129,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"O'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance;"
130,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"And the thick heavy spume-flakes, which aye and anon"
131,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,His fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on.
132,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,
133,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"By Hasselt, Dirck groaned; and cried Joris, ""Stay spur!"
134,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in her;"
135,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"""We'll remember at Aix""--for one heard the quick wheeze"
136,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"Of her chest, saw the stretched neck and staggering knees,"
137,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,"
138,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.
139,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,
140,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"So we were left galloping, Joris and I,"
141,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;"
142,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh;
143,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,'Neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff;
144,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"Till over by Delhem a dome spire sprung white,"
145,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"And ""Gallop,"" gasped Joris, ""for Aix is in sight!"
146,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,
147,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"""How they'll greet us!""--and all in a moment his roan"
148,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"Rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone;"
149,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight
150,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"Of the news which alone could save Aix from her fate,"
151,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,"
152,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,And with circles of red for his eye-sockets' rim.
153,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,
154,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"Then I cast loose my buff-coat, each holster let fall,"
155,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all,"
156,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear,"
157,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"Called my Roland his pet name, my horse without peer--"
158,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"Clapped my hands, laughed and sung, any noise, bad or good,"
159,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood.
160,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,
161,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"And all I remember is friends flocking around,"
162,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,As I sate with his head twixt my knees on the ground;
163,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine
164,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,"As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,"
165,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)
166,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,Was no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent.
167,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,
168,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,
169,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,
170,HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.,
171,MOTHER AND POET.,MOTHER AND POET.
172,MOTHER AND POET.,
173,MOTHER AND POET.,
174,MOTHER AND POET.,"Dead! one of them shot by the sea in the east,"
175,MOTHER AND POET.,And one of them shot in the west by the sea.
176,MOTHER AND POET.,Dead! both my boys!  When you sit at the feast
177,MOTHER AND POET.,"And are wanting a great song for Italy free,"
178,MOTHER AND POET.,Let none look at _me_!
179,MOTHER AND POET.,
180,MOTHER AND POET.,"Yet I was a poetess only last year,"
181,MOTHER AND POET.,"And good at my art for a woman, men said,"
182,MOTHER AND POET.,"But _this_ woman, _this_, who is agonized here,"
183,MOTHER AND POET.,The east sea and west sea rhyme on in her head
184,MOTHER AND POET.,Forever instead.
185,MOTHER AND POET.,
186,MOTHER AND POET.,"What art can woman be good at?  Oh, vain!"
187,MOTHER AND POET.,"What art _is_ she good at, but hurting her breast"
188,MOTHER AND POET.,"With the milk-teeth of babes, and a smile at the pain?"
189,MOTHER AND POET.,"Ah, boys, how you hurt! you were strong as you pressed,"
190,MOTHER AND POET.,And _I_ proud by that test.
191,MOTHER AND POET.,
192,MOTHER AND POET.,What's art for a woman?  To hold on her knees
193,MOTHER AND POET.,Both darlings! to feel all their arms round her throat
194,MOTHER AND POET.,"Cling, strangle a little!  To sew by degrees,"
195,MOTHER AND POET.,And 'broider the long clothes and neat little coat!
196,MOTHER AND POET.,To dream and to dote.
197,MOTHER AND POET.,
198,MOTHER AND POET.,To teach them . . .  It stings there.  _I_ made them indeed
199,MOTHER AND POET.,"Speak plain the word 'country.'  I taught them, no doubt,"
200,MOTHER AND POET.,That a country's a thing men should die for at need.
201,MOTHER AND POET.,"_I_ prated of liberty, rights, and about"
202,MOTHER AND POET.,The tyrant turned out.
203,MOTHER AND POET.,
204,MOTHER AND POET.,"And when their eyes flashed, oh, my beautiful eyes!"
205,MOTHER AND POET.,"I exulted! nay, let them go forth at the wheels"
206,MOTHER AND POET.,"Of the guns, and denied not.  But then the surprise,"
207,MOTHER AND POET.,"When one sits quite alone!  Then one weeps, then one kneels!"
208,MOTHER AND POET.,--God! how the house feels.
209,MOTHER AND POET.,
210,MOTHER AND POET.,"At first happy news came, in gay letters moiled"
211,MOTHER AND POET.,"With my kisses, of camp-life and glory, and how"
212,MOTHER AND POET.,"They both loved me, and soon, coming home to be spoiled,"
213,MOTHER AND POET.,In return would fan off every fly from my brow
214,MOTHER AND POET.,With their green laurel bough.
215,MOTHER AND POET.,
216,MOTHER AND POET.,Then was triumph at Turin.  'Ancona was free!'
217,MOTHER AND POET.,"And some one came out of the cheers in the street,"
218,MOTHER AND POET.,With a face pale as stone to say something to me.
219,MOTHER AND POET.,My Guido was dead!  I fell down at his feet
220,MOTHER AND POET.,While they cheered in the street.
221,MOTHER AND POET.,
222,MOTHER AND POET.,I bore it--friends soothed me: my grief looked sublime
223,MOTHER AND POET.,As the ransom of Italy.  One boy remained
224,MOTHER AND POET.,"To be leant on and walked with, recalling the time"
225,MOTHER AND POET.,"When the first grew immortal, while both of us strained"
226,MOTHER AND POET.,To the height he had gained.
227,MOTHER AND POET.,
228,MOTHER AND POET.,"And letters still came--shorter, sadder, more strong,"
229,MOTHER AND POET.,"Writ now but in one hand.  I was not to faint,"
230,MOTHER AND POET.,"One loved me for two . . . would be with me ere long,"
231,MOTHER AND POET.,"And 'Viva Italia' _he_ died for, our saint,"
232,MOTHER AND POET.,Who forbids our complaint.
233,MOTHER AND POET.,
234,MOTHER AND POET.,"{ Dead! One of them shot by the sea in the east,"
235,MOTHER AND POET.,And one of them shot in the West by the sea: p2.jpg}
236,MOTHER AND POET.,
237,MOTHER AND POET.,"My Nanni would add, 'he was safe and aware"
238,MOTHER AND POET.,Of a presence that turned off the balls . . . was imprest
239,MOTHER AND POET.,"It was Guido himself, who knew what I could bear,"
240,MOTHER AND POET.,"And how 'twas impossible, quite dispossessed,"
241,MOTHER AND POET.,To live on for the rest.'
242,MOTHER AND POET.,
243,MOTHER AND POET.,"On which, without pause, up the telegraph line,"
244,MOTHER AND POET.,Swept smoothly the next news from Gaeta--_Shot_.
245,MOTHER AND POET.,"_Tell his mother_.  Ah, ah! 'his,' 'their' mother: not 'mine.'"
246,MOTHER AND POET.,No voice says '_my_ mother' again to me.  What!
247,MOTHER AND POET.,You think Guido forgot?
248,MOTHER AND POET.,
249,MOTHER AND POET.,"Are souls straight so happy that, dizzy with Heaven,"
250,MOTHER AND POET.,"They drop earth's affection, conceive not of woe?"
251,MOTHER AND POET.,I think not.  Themselves were too lately forgiven
252,MOTHER AND POET.,Through that Love and Sorrow which reconciled so
253,MOTHER AND POET.,The Above and Below.
254,MOTHER AND POET.,
255,MOTHER AND POET.,"O Christ of the seven wounds, who look'dst through the dark"
256,MOTHER AND POET.,"To the face of thy mother! consider, I pray,"
257,MOTHER AND POET.,"How we common mothers stand desolate, mark,"
258,MOTHER AND POET.,"Whose sons, not being Christs, die with eyes turned away,"
259,MOTHER AND POET.,And no last word to say!
260,MOTHER AND POET.,
261,MOTHER AND POET.,Both boys dead! but that's out of nature.  We all
262,MOTHER AND POET.,"Have been patriots, yet each house must always keep one."
263,MOTHER AND POET.,"'Twere imbecile hewing out roads to a wall,"
264,MOTHER AND POET.,"And when Italy's made, for what end is it done"
265,MOTHER AND POET.,If we have not a son?
266,MOTHER AND POET.,
267,MOTHER AND POET.,"Ah! ah! ah! when Gaeta's taken, what then?"
268,MOTHER AND POET.,"When the fair, wicked queen sits no more at her sport"
269,MOTHER AND POET.,Of the fire-balls of death crashing souls out of men?
270,MOTHER AND POET.,"When your guns of Cavalli, with final retort,"
271,MOTHER AND POET.,Have cut the game short--
272,MOTHER AND POET.,
273,MOTHER AND POET.,"When Venice and Rome keep their new jubilee,"
274,MOTHER AND POET.,"When your flag takes all Heaven for its white, green, and red,"
275,MOTHER AND POET.,"When _you_ have your country from mountain to sea,"
276,MOTHER AND POET.,"When King Victor has Italy's crown on his head,"
277,MOTHER AND POET.,(And I have my dead)
278,MOTHER AND POET.,
279,MOTHER AND POET.,"What then?  Do not mock me!  Ah, ring your bells low!"
280,MOTHER AND POET.,"And burn your lights faintly.  _My_ country is there,"
281,MOTHER AND POET.,Above the star pricked by the last peak of snow.
282,MOTHER AND POET.,"_My_ Italy's there--with my brave civic Pair,"
283,MOTHER AND POET.,To disfranchise despair.
284,MOTHER AND POET.,
285,MOTHER AND POET.,"Forgive me.  Some women bear children in strength,"
286,MOTHER AND POET.,"And bite back the cry of their pain in self-scorn,"
287,MOTHER AND POET.,But the birth-pangs of nations will wring us at length
288,MOTHER AND POET.,Into wail such as this! and we sit on forlorn
289,MOTHER AND POET.,When the man-child is born.
290,MOTHER AND POET.,
291,MOTHER AND POET.,Dead! one of them shot by the sea in the west!
292,MOTHER AND POET.,And one of them shot in the east by the sea!
293,MOTHER AND POET.,"Both! both my boys!  If, in keeping the feast,"
294,MOTHER AND POET.,"You want a great song for your Italy free,"
295,MOTHER AND POET.,Let none look at _me_!

369,TO A SKYLARK.,
370,TO A SKYLARK.,Keen as are the arrows
371,TO A SKYLARK.,Of that silver sphere
372,TO A SKYLARK.,Whose intense lamp narrows
373,TO A SKYLARK.,In the white dawn clear
374,TO A SKYLARK.,"Until we hardly see, we feel, that it is there."
375,TO A SKYLARK.,
376,TO A SKYLARK.,All the earth and air
377,TO A SKYLARK.,"With thy voice is loud,"
378,TO A SKYLARK.,"As, when night is bare,"
379,TO A SKYLARK.,From one lonely cloud
380,TO A SKYLARK.,"The moon rains out her beams, and heaven is overflowed."
381,TO A SKYLARK.,
382,TO A SKYLARK.,What thou art we know not;
383,TO A SKYLARK.,What is most like thee?
384,TO A SKYLARK.,From rainbow-clouds there flow not
385,TO A SKYLARK.,Drops so bright to see
386,TO A SKYLARK.,As from thy presence showers a rain of melody:--
387,TO A SKYLARK.,
388,TO A SKYLARK.,Like a poet hidden
389,TO A SKYLARK.,"In the light of thought,"
390,TO A SKYLARK.,"Singing hymns unbidden,"
391,TO A SKYLARK.,Till the world is wrought
392,TO A SKYLARK.,To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not;
393,TO A SKYLARK.,
394,TO A SKYLARK.,Like a high-born maiden
395,TO A SKYLARK.,"In a palace tower,"
396,TO A SKYLARK.,Soothing her love-laden
397,TO A SKYLARK.,Soul in secret hour
398,TO A SKYLARK.,With music sweet as love which overflows her bower;
399,TO A SKYLARK.,
400,TO A SKYLARK.,Like a glow-worm golden
401,TO A SKYLARK.,"In a dell of dew,"
402,TO A SKYLARK.,Scattering unbeholden
403,TO A SKYLARK.,Its aerial hue
404,TO A SKYLARK.,Among the flowers and grass which screen it from the view;
405,TO A SKYLARK.,
406,TO A SKYLARK.,Like a rose embowered
407,TO A SKYLARK.,"In its own green leaves,"
408,TO A SKYLARK.,"By warm winds deflowered,"
409,TO A SKYLARK.,Till the scent it gives
410,TO A SKYLARK.,Makes faint with too much heat these heavy-winged thieves;
411,TO A SKYLARK.,
412,TO A SKYLARK.,"{Thou art unseen, but yet I hear they shrill delight: p4.jpg}"
413,TO A SKYLARK.,
414,TO A SKYLARK.,Sound of vernal showers
415,TO A SKYLARK.,"On the twinkling grass,"
416,TO A SKYLARK.,Rain-awakened flowers--
417,TO A SKYLARK.,All that ever was
418,TO A SKYLARK.,Joyous and clear and fresh--thy music doth surpass.
419,TO A SKYLARK.,
420,TO A SKYLARK.,"Teach us, sprite or bird,"
421,TO A SKYLARK.,What sweet thoughts are thine:
422,TO A SKYLARK.,I have never heard
423,TO A SKYLARK.,Praise of love or wine
424,TO A SKYLARK.,That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.
425,TO A SKYLARK.,
426,TO A SKYLARK.,"Chorus hymeneal,"
427,TO A SKYLARK.,"Or triumphal chaunt,"
428,TO A SKYLARK.,"Matched with thine, would be all"
429,TO A SKYLARK.,But an empty vaunt--
430,TO A SKYLARK.,A thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want.
431,TO A SKYLARK.,
432,TO A SKYLARK.,What objects are the fountains
433,TO A SKYLARK.,Of the happy strain?
434,TO A SKYLARK.,"What fields, or waves or mountains?"
435,TO A SKYLARK.,What shapes of sky or plain?
436,TO A SKYLARK.,What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain?
437,TO A SKYLARK.,
438,TO A SKYLARK.,With thy clear keen joyance
439,TO A SKYLARK.,Languor cannot be:
440,TO A SKYLARK.,Shadow of annoyance
441,TO A SKYLARK.,Never came near thee:
442,TO A SKYLARK.,"Thou lovest, but ne'er knew love's sad satiety."
443,TO A SKYLARK.,
444,TO A SKYLARK.,"Waking or asleep,"
445,TO A SKYLARK.,Thou of death must deem
446,TO A SKYLARK.,Things more true and deep
447,TO A SKYLARK.,"Than we mortals dream,"
448,TO A SKYLARK.,Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?
449,TO A SKYLARK.,
450,TO A SKYLARK.,"We look before and after,"
451,TO A SKYLARK.,And pine for what is not;
452,TO A SKYLARK.,Our sincerest laughter
453,TO A SKYLARK.,With some pain is fraught;
454,TO A SKYLARK.,Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
455,TO A SKYLARK.,
456,TO A SKYLARK.,"Yet, if we could scorn"
457,TO A SKYLARK.,"Hate and pride and fear,"
458,TO A SKYLARK.,If we were things born
459,TO A SKYLARK.,"Not to shed a tear,"
460,TO A SKYLARK.,I know not how thy joy we ever should come near.
461,TO A SKYLARK.,
462,TO A SKYLARK.,Better than all measures
463,TO A SKYLARK.,"Of delightful sound,"
464,TO A SKYLARK.,Better than all treasures
465,TO A SKYLARK.,"That in books are found,"
466,TO A SKYLARK.,"Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!"
467,TO A SKYLARK.,
468,TO A SKYLARK.,Teach me half the gladness
469,TO A SKYLARK.,"That thy brain must know,"
470,TO A SKYLARK.,Such harmonious madness
471,TO A SKYLARK.,From my lips would flow
472,TO A SKYLARK.,The world should listen then as I am listening now.
473,TO A SKYLARK.,
474,TO A SKYLARK.,
475,TO A SKYLARK.,
476,TO A SKYLARK.,
477,TO A SKYLARK.,
