126,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS
127,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,
128,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,
129,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"In the spring of the year 1853, I observed, as conductor of the weekly"
130,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"journal Household Words, a short poem among the proffered contributions,"
131,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"very different, as I thought, from the shoal of verses perpetually"
132,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"setting through the office of such a periodical, and possessing much more"
133,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,merit.  Its authoress was quite unknown to me.  She was one Miss Mary
134,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"Berwick, whom I had never heard of; and she was to be addressed by"
135,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"letter, if addressed at all, at a circulating library in the western"
136,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"district of London.  Through this channel, Miss Berwick was informed that"
137,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"her poem was accepted, and was invited to send another.  She complied,"
138,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,and became a regular and frequent contributor.  Many letters passed
139,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"between the journal and Miss Berwick, but Miss Berwick herself was never"
140,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,seen.
141,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,
142,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"How we came gradually to establish, at the office of Household Words,"
143,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"that we knew all about Miss Berwick, I have never discovered.  But we"
144,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"settled somehow, to our complete satisfaction, that she was governess in"
145,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"a family; that she went to Italy in that capacity, and returned; and that"
146,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,she had long been in the same family.  We really knew nothing whatever of
147,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"her, except that she was remarkably business-like, punctual,"
148,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"self-reliant, and reliable: so I suppose we insensibly invented the rest."
149,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"For myself, my mother was not a more real personage to me, than Miss"
150,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,Berwick the governess became.
151,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,
152,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"This went on until December, 1854, when the Christmas number, entitled"
153,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"The Seven Poor Travellers, was sent to press.  Happening to be going to"
154,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"dine that day with an old and dear friend, distinguished in literature as"
155,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"Barry Cornwall, I took with me an early proof of that number, and"
156,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"remarked, as I laid it on the drawing-room table, that it contained a"
157,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"very pretty poem, written by a certain Miss Berwick.  Next day brought me"
158,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,the disclosure that I had so spoken of the poem to the mother of its
159,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"writer, in its writer's presence; that I had no such correspondent in"
160,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,existence as Miss Berwick; and that the name had been assumed by Barry
161,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"Cornwall's eldest daughter, Miss Adelaide Anne Procter."
162,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,
163,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"The anecdote I have here noted down, besides serving to explain why the"
164,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,parents of the late Miss Procter have looked to me for these poor words
165,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"of remembrance of their lamented child, strikingly illustrates the"
166,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"honesty, independence, and quiet dignity, of the lady's character.  I had"
167,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,known her when she was very young; I had been honoured with her father's
168,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"friendship when I was myself a young aspirant; and she had said at home,"
169,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"""If I send him, in my own name, verses that he does not honestly like,"
170,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"either it will be very painful to him to return them, or he will print"
171,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"them for papa's sake, and not for their own.  So I have made up my mind"
172,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"to take my chance fairly with the unknown volunteers."""
173,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,
174,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,Perhaps it requires an editor's experience of the profoundly unreasonable
175,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,grounds on which he is often urged to accept unsuitable articles--such as
176,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"having been to school with the writer's husband's brother-in-law, or"
177,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"having lent an alpenstock in Switzerland to the writer's wife's nephew,"
178,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,when that interesting stranger had broken his own--fully to appreciate
179,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,the delicacy and the self-respect of this resolution.
180,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,
181,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"Some verses by Miss Procter had been published in the Book of Beauty, ten"
182,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,years before she became Miss Berwick.  With the exception of two poems in
183,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"the Cornhill Magazine, two in Good Words, and others in a little book"
184,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,called A Chaplet of Verses (issued in 1862 for the benefit of a Night
185,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"Refuge), her published writings first appeared in Household Words, or All"
186,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,the Year Round.  The present edition contains the whole of her Legends
187,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"and Lyrics, and originates in the great favour with which they have been"
188,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,received by the public.
189,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,
190,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"Miss Procter was born in Bedford Square, London, on the 30th of October,"
191,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"1825.  Her love of poetry was conspicuous at so early an age, that I have"
192,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"before me a tiny album made of small note-paper, into which her favourite"
193,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,passages were copied for her by her mother's hand before she herself
194,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"could write.  It looks as if she had carried it about, as another little"
195,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"girl might have carried a doll.  She soon displayed a remarkable memory,"
196,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"and great quickness of apprehension.  When she was quite a young child,"
197,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,she learned with facility several of the problems of Euclid.  As she grew
198,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"older, she acquired the French, Italian, and German languages; became a"
199,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,clever pianoforte player; and showed a true taste and sentiment in
200,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"drawing.  But, as soon as she had completely vanquished the difficulties"
201,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"of any one branch of study, it was her way to lose interest in it, and"
202,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"pass to another.  While her mental resources were being trained, it was"
203,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"not at all suspected in her family that she had any gift of authorship,"
204,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,or any ambition to become a writer.  Her father had no idea of her having
205,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"ever attempted to turn a rhyme, until her first little poem saw the light"
206,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,in print.
207,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,
208,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"When she attained to womanhood, she had read an extraordinary number of"
209,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"books, and throughout her life she was always largely adding to the"
210,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"number.  In 1853 she went to Turin and its neighbourhood, on a visit to"
211,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"her aunt, a Roman Catholic lady.  As Miss Procter had herself professed"
212,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"the Roman Catholic Faith two years before, she entered with the greater"
213,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"ardour on the study of the Piedmontese dialect, and the observation of"
214,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"the habits and manners of the peasantry.  In the former, she soon became"
215,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"a proficient.  On the latter head, I extract from her familiar letters"
216,AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS,"written home to England at the time, two pleasant pieces of description."

222,A BETROTHAL,
223,A BETROTHAL,"""We have been to a ball, of which I must give you a description.  Last"
224,A BETROTHAL,"Tuesday we had just done dinner at about seven, and stepped out into the"
225,A BETROTHAL,"balcony to look at the remains of the sunset behind the mountains, when"
226,A BETROTHAL,"we heard very distinctly a band of music, which rather excited my"
227,A BETROTHAL,"astonishment, as a solitary organ is the utmost that toils up here.  I"
228,A BETROTHAL,"went out of the room for a few minutes, and, on my returning, Emily said,"
229,A BETROTHAL,'Oh!  That band is playing at the farmer's near here.  The daughter is
230,A BETROTHAL,"fiancee to-day, and they have a ball.'  I said, 'I wish I was going!'"
231,A BETROTHAL,"'Well,' replied she, 'the farmer's wife did call to invite us.'  'Then I"
232,A BETROTHAL,"shall certainly go,' I exclaimed.  I applied to Madame B., who said she"
233,A BETROTHAL,"would like it very much, and we had better go, children and all.  Some of"
234,A BETROTHAL,"the servants were already gone.  We rushed away to put on some shawls,"
235,A BETROTHAL,and put off any shred of black we might have about us (as the people
236,A BETROTHAL,would have been quite annoyed if we had appeared on such an occasion with
237,A BETROTHAL,"any black), and we started.  When we reached the farmer's, which is a"
238,A BETROTHAL,"stone's throw above our house, we were received with great enthusiasm;"
239,A BETROTHAL,"the only drawback being, that no one spoke French, and we did not yet"
240,A BETROTHAL,"speak Piedmontese.  We were placed on a bench against the wall, and the"
241,A BETROTHAL,people went on dancing.  The room was a large whitewashed kitchen (I
242,A BETROTHAL,"suppose), with several large pictures in black frames, and very smoky.  I"
243,A BETROTHAL,"distinguished the Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, and the others appeared"
244,A BETROTHAL,equally lively and appropriate subjects.  Whether they were Old Masters
245,A BETROTHAL,"or not, and if so, by whom, I could not ascertain.  The band were seated"
246,A BETROTHAL,"opposite us.  Five men, with wind instruments, part of the band of the"
247,A BETROTHAL,"National Guard, to which the farmer's sons belong.  They played really"
248,A BETROTHAL,"admirably, and I began to be afraid that some idea of our dignity would"
249,A BETROTHAL,"prevent me getting a partner; so, by Madame B.'s advice, I went up to the"
250,A BETROTHAL,"bride, and offered to dance with her.  Such a handsome young woman!  Like"
251,A BETROTHAL,"one of Uwins's pictures.  Very dark, with a quantity of black hair, and"
252,A BETROTHAL,"on an immense scale.  The children were already dancing, as well as the"
253,A BETROTHAL,"maids.  After we came to an end of our dance, which was what they called"
254,A BETROTHAL,"a Polka-Mazourka, I saw the bride trying to screw up the courage of her"
255,A BETROTHAL,"fiance to ask me to dance, which after a little hesitation he did.  And"
256,A BETROTHAL,"admirably he danced, as indeed they all did--in excellent time, and with"
257,A BETROTHAL,"a little more spirit than one sees in a ball-room.  In fact, they were"
258,A BETROTHAL,"very like one's ordinary partners, except that they wore earrings and"
259,A BETROTHAL,"were in their shirt-sleeves, and truth compels me to state that they"
260,A BETROTHAL,"decidedly smelt of garlic.  Some of them had been smoking, but threw away"
261,A BETROTHAL,their cigars when we came in.  The only thing that did not look cheerful
262,A BETROTHAL,"was, that the room was only lighted by two or three oil-lamps, and that"
263,A BETROTHAL,"there seemed to be no preparation for refreshments.  Madame B., seeing"
264,A BETROTHAL,"this, whispered to her maid, who disengaged herself from her partner, and"
265,A BETROTHAL,ran off to the house; she and the kitchenmaid presently returning with a
266,A BETROTHAL,large tray covered with all kinds of cakes (of which we are great
267,A BETROTHAL,"consumers and always have a stock), and a large hamper full of bottles of"
268,A BETROTHAL,"wine, with coffee and sugar.  This seemed all very acceptable.  The"
269,A BETROTHAL,"fiancee was requested to distribute the eatables, and a bucket of water"
270,A BETROTHAL,"being produced to wash the glasses in, the wine disappeared very"
271,A BETROTHAL,"quickly--as fast as they could open the bottles.  But, elated, I suppose,"
272,A BETROTHAL,"by this, the floor was sprinkled with water, and the musicians played a"
273,A BETROTHAL,"Monferrino, which is a Piedmontese dance.  Madame B. danced with the"
274,A BETROTHAL,"farmer's son, and Emily with another distinguished member of the company."
275,A BETROTHAL,It was very fatiguing--something like a Scotch reel.  My partner was a
276,A BETROTHAL,"little man, like Perrot, and very proud of his dancing.  He cut in the"
277,A BETROTHAL,"air and twisted about, until I was out of breath, though my attempts to"
278,A BETROTHAL,"imitate him were feeble in the extreme.  At last, after seven or eight"
279,A BETROTHAL,"dances, I was obliged to sit down.  We stayed till nine, and I was so"
280,A BETROTHAL,"dead beat with the heat that I could hardly crawl about the house, and in"
281,A BETROTHAL,"an agony with the cramp, it is so long since I have danced."""

285,A MARRIAGE,A MARRIAGE
286,A MARRIAGE,
287,A MARRIAGE,
288,A MARRIAGE,The wedding of the farmer's daughter has taken place.  We had hoped it
289,A MARRIAGE,"would have been in the little chapel of our house, but it seems some"
290,A MARRIAGE,"special permission was necessary, and they applied for it too late.  They"
291,A MARRIAGE,"all said, ""This is the Constitution.  There would have been no difficulty"
292,A MARRIAGE,"before!"" the lower classes making the poor Constitution the scapegoat for"
293,A MARRIAGE,everything they don't like.  So as it was impossible for us to climb up
294,A MARRIAGE,"to the church where the wedding was to be, we contented ourselves with"
295,A MARRIAGE,"seeing the procession pass.  It was not a very large one, for, it"
296,A MARRIAGE,"requiring some activity to go up, all the old people remained at home.  It"
297,A MARRIAGE,"is not etiquette for the bride's mother to go, and no unmarried woman can"
298,A MARRIAGE,go to a wedding--I suppose for fear of its making her discontented with
299,A MARRIAGE,"her own position.  The procession stopped at our door, for the bride to"
300,A MARRIAGE,"receive our congratulations.  She was dressed in a shot silk, with a"
301,A MARRIAGE,"yellow handkerchief, and rows of a large gold chain.  In the afternoon"
302,A MARRIAGE,they sent to request us to go there.  On our arrival we found them
303,A MARRIAGE,"dancing out of doors, and a most melancholy affair it was.  All the"
304,A MARRIAGE,"bride's sisters were not to be recognised, they had cried so.  The mother"
305,A MARRIAGE,"sat in the house, and could not appear.  And the bride was sobbing so,"
306,A MARRIAGE,she could hardly stand!  The most melancholy spectacle of all to my mind
307,A MARRIAGE,"was, that the bridegroom was decidedly tipsy.  He seemed rather affronted"
308,A MARRIAGE,at all the distress.  We danced a Monferrino; I with the bridegroom; and
309,A MARRIAGE,the bride crying the whole time.  The company did their utmost to enliven
310,A MARRIAGE,"her by firing pistols, but without success, and at last they began a"
311,A MARRIAGE,"series of yells, which reminded me of a set of savages.  But even this"
312,A MARRIAGE,"delicate method of consolation failed, and the wishing good-bye began.  It"
313,A MARRIAGE,was altogether so melancholy an affair that Madame B. dropped a few
314,A MARRIAGE,"tears, and I was very near it, particularly when the poor mother came out"
315,A MARRIAGE,"to see the last of her daughter, who was finally dragged off between her"
316,A MARRIAGE,"brother and uncle, with a last explosion of pistols.  As she lives quite"
317,A MARRIAGE,"near, makes an excellent match, and is one of nine children, it really"
318,A MARRIAGE,"was a most desirable marriage, in spite of all the show of distress."
319,A MARRIAGE,"Albert was so discomfited by it, that he forgot to kiss the bride as he"
320,A MARRIAGE,"had intended to do, and therefore went to call upon her yesterday, and"
321,A MARRIAGE,"found her very smiling in her new house, and supplied the omission.  The"
322,A MARRIAGE,"cook came home from the wedding, declaring she was cured of any wish to"
323,A MARRIAGE,marry--but I would not recommend any man to act upon that threat and make
324,A MARRIAGE,her an offer.  In a couple of days we had some rolls of the bride's first
325,A MARRIAGE,"baking, which they call Madonnas.  The musicians, it seems, were in the"
326,A MARRIAGE,"same state as the bridegroom, for, in escorting her home, they all fell"
327,A MARRIAGE,down in the mud.  My wrath against the bridegroom is somewhat calmed by
328,A MARRIAGE,finding that it is considered bad luck if he does not get tipsy at his
329,A MARRIAGE,"wedding."""

332,A MARRIAGE,
333,A MARRIAGE,Those readers of Miss Procter's poems who should suppose from their tone
334,A MARRIAGE,"that her mind was of a gloomy or despondent cast, would be curiously"
335,A MARRIAGE,"mistaken.  She was exceedingly humorous, and had a great delight in"
336,A MARRIAGE,"humour.  Cheerfulness was habitual with her, she was very ready at a"
337,A MARRIAGE,"sally or a reply, and in her laugh (as I remember well) there was an"
338,A MARRIAGE,"unusual vivacity, enjoyment, and sense of drollery.  She was perfectly"
339,A MARRIAGE,"unconstrained and unaffected: as modestly silent about her productions,"
340,A MARRIAGE,as she was generous with their pecuniary results.  She was a friend who
341,A MARRIAGE,"inspired the strongest attachments; she was a finely sympathetic woman,"
342,A MARRIAGE,with a great accordant heart and a sterling noble nature.  No claim can
343,A MARRIAGE,"be set up for her, thank God, to the possession of any of the"
344,A MARRIAGE,conventional poetical qualities.  She never by any means held the opinion
345,A MARRIAGE,that she was among the greatest of human beings; she never suspected the
346,A MARRIAGE,existence of a conspiracy on the part of mankind against her; she never
347,A MARRIAGE,"recognised in her best friends, her worst enemies; she never cultivated"
348,A MARRIAGE,the luxury of being misunderstood and unappreciated; she would far rather
349,A MARRIAGE,"have died without seeing a line of her composition in print, than that I"
350,A MARRIAGE,"should have maundered about her, here, as ""the Poet"", or ""the Poetess""."
351,A MARRIAGE,
352,A MARRIAGE,"With the recollection of Miss Procter as a mere child and as a woman,"
353,A MARRIAGE,"fresh upon me, it is natural that I should linger on my way to the close"
354,A MARRIAGE,"of this brief record, avoiding its end.  But, even as the close came upon"
355,A MARRIAGE,"her, so must it come here."
356,A MARRIAGE,
357,A MARRIAGE,Always impelled by an intense conviction that her life must not be
358,A MARRIAGE,"dreamed away, and that her indulgence in her favourite pursuits must be"
359,A MARRIAGE,"balanced by action in the real world around her, she was indefatigable in"
360,A MARRIAGE,"her endeavours to do some good.  Naturally enthusiastic, and"
361,A MARRIAGE,conscientiously impressed with a deep sense of her Christian duty to her
362,A MARRIAGE,"neighbour, she devoted herself to a variety of benevolent objects.  Now,"
363,A MARRIAGE,"it was the visitation of the sick, that had possession of her; now, it"
364,A MARRIAGE,"was the sheltering of the houseless; now, it was the elementary teaching"
365,A MARRIAGE,"of the densely ignorant; now, it was the raising up of those who had"
366,A MARRIAGE,"wandered and got trodden under foot; now, it was the wider employment of"
367,A MARRIAGE,"her own sex in the general business of life; now, it was all these things"
368,A MARRIAGE,"at once.  Perfectly unselfish, swift to sympathise and eager to relieve,"
369,A MARRIAGE,she wrought at such designs with a flushed earnestness that disregarded
370,A MARRIAGE,"season, weather, time of day or night, food, rest.  Under such a hurry of"
371,A MARRIAGE,"the spirits, and such incessant occupation, the strongest constitution"
372,A MARRIAGE,"will commonly go down.  Hers, neither of the strongest nor the weakest,"
373,A MARRIAGE,"yielded to the burden, and began to sink."
374,A MARRIAGE,
375,A MARRIAGE,"To have saved her life, then, by taking action on the warning that shone"
376,A MARRIAGE,"in her eyes and sounded in her voice, would have been impossible, without"
377,A MARRIAGE,changing her nature.  As long as the power of moving about in the old way
378,A MARRIAGE,"was left to her, she must exercise it, or be killed by the restraint.  And"
379,A MARRIAGE,"so the time came when she could move about no longer, and took to her"
380,A MARRIAGE,bed.
381,A MARRIAGE,
382,A MARRIAGE,"All the restlessness gone then, and all the sweet patience of her natural"
383,A MARRIAGE,"disposition purified by the resignation of her soul, she lay upon her bed"
384,A MARRIAGE,through the whole round of changes of the seasons.  She lay upon her bed
385,A MARRIAGE,"through fifteen months.  In all that time, her old cheerfulness never"
386,A MARRIAGE,"quitted her.  In all that time, not an impatient or a querulous minute"
387,A MARRIAGE,can be remembered.
388,A MARRIAGE,
389,A MARRIAGE,"At length, at midnight on the second of February, 1864, she turned down a"
390,A MARRIAGE,"leaf of a little book she was reading, and shut it up."
391,A MARRIAGE,
392,A MARRIAGE,The ministering hand that had copied the verses into the tiny album was
393,A MARRIAGE,"soon around her neck, and she quietly asked, as the clock was on the"
394,A MARRIAGE,stroke of one:
395,A MARRIAGE,
396,A MARRIAGE,"""Do you think I am dying, mamma?"""
397,A MARRIAGE,
398,A MARRIAGE,"""I think you are very, very ill to-night, my dear!"""
399,A MARRIAGE,
400,A MARRIAGE,"""Send for my sister.  My feet are so cold.  Lift me up?"""
401,A MARRIAGE,
402,A MARRIAGE,"Her sister entering as they raised her, she said: ""It has come at last!"""
403,A MARRIAGE,"And with a bright and happy smile, looked upward, and departed."
404,A MARRIAGE,
405,A MARRIAGE,Well had she written:
406,A MARRIAGE,
407,A MARRIAGE,"Why shouldst thou fear the beautiful angel, Death,"
408,A MARRIAGE,"Who waits thee at the portals of the skies,"
409,A MARRIAGE,"Ready to kiss away thy struggling breath,"
410,A MARRIAGE,Ready with gentle hand to close thine eyes?
411,A MARRIAGE,
412,A MARRIAGE,"Oh what were life, if life were all?  Thine eyes"
413,A MARRIAGE,"Are blinded by their tears, or thou wouldst see"
414,A MARRIAGE,"Thy treasures wait thee in the far-off skies,"
415,A MARRIAGE,"And Death, thy friend, will give them all to thee."

422,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
423,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Through the blue and frosty heavens
424,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Christmas stars were shining bright;
425,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Glistening lamps throughout the City
426,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Almost matched their gleaming light;
427,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"While the winter snow was lying,"

429,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Long ago, one Christmas night."
430,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
431,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"While, from every tower and steeple,"

433,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"(Never with such tones of gladness,"

435,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Many a one that night was merry
436,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Who had toiled through all the year.
437,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
438,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"That night saw old wrongs forgiven,"

443,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,From their anxious thoughts beguiled.
444,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
445,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Rich and poor felt love and blessing
446,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,From the gracious season fall;
447,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Joy and plenty in the cottage,"
448,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Peace and feasting in the hall;
449,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,And the voices of the children
450,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Ringing clear above it all!
451,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
452,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Yet one house was dim and darkened;
453,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Gloom, and sickness, and despair,"
454,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Dwelling in the gilded chambers.
455,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Creeping up the marble stair,"
456,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Even stilled the voice of mourning--
457,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,For a child lay dying there.
458,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
459,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Silken curtains fell around him,"
460,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Velvet carpets hushed the tread.
461,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Many costly toys were lying,"
462,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"All unheeded, by his bed;"
463,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,And his tangled golden ringlets
464,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Were on downy pillows spread.
465,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
466,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,The skill of all that mighty City
467,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,To save one little life was vain;
468,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"One little thread from being broken,"
469,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,One fatal word from being spoken;
470,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Nay, his very mother's pain,"
471,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"And the mighty love within her,"
472,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Could not give him health again.
473,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
474,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"So she knelt there still beside him,"
475,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"She alone with strength to smile,"
476,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Promising that he should suffer
477,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"No more in a little while,"
478,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Murmuring tender song and story
479,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Weary hours to beguile.
480,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
481,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Suddenly an unseen Presence
482,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Checked those constant moaning cries,"
483,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Stilled the little heart's quick fluttering,"
484,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Raised those blue and wondering eyes,"
485,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Fixed on some mysterious vision,"
486,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,With a startled sweet surprise.
487,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
488,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"For a radiant angel hovered,"
489,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Smiling, o'er the little bed;"
490,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"White his raiment, from his shoulders"
491,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Snowy dove-like pinions spread,"
492,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,And a starlike light was shining
493,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,In a Glory round his head.
494,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
495,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"While, with tender love, the angel,"
496,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Leaning o'er the little nest,"
497,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"In his arms the sick child folding,"
498,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Laid him gently on his breast,"
499,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Sobs and wailings told the mother
500,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,That her darling was at rest.
501,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
502,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"So the angel, slowing rising,"
503,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Spread his wings; and, through the air,"
504,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Bore the child, and while he held him"
505,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"To his heart with loving care,"
506,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Placed a branch of crimson roses
507,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Tenderly beside him there.
508,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
509,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"While the child, thus clinging, floated"
510,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Towards the mansions of the Blest,"
511,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Gazing from his shining guardian
512,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"To the flowers upon his breast,"
513,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Thus the angel spake, still smiling"
514,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,On the little heavenly guest:
515,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
516,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""Know, dear little one, that Heaven"
517,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Does no earthly thing disdain,"
518,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Man's poor joys find there an echo
519,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Just as surely as his pain;
520,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Love, on earth so feebly striving,"
521,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Lives divine in Heaven again!
522,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
523,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""Once in that great town below us,"
524,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"In a poor and narrow street,"
525,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Dwelt a little sickly orphan;
526,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Gentle aid, or pity sweet,"
527,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Never in life's rugged pathway
528,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Guided his poor tottering feet.
529,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
530,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""All the striving anxious forethought"
531,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"That should only come with age,"
532,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Weighed upon his baby spirit,"
533,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Showed him soon life's sternest page;
534,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Grim Want was his nurse, and Sorrow"
535,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Was his only heritage.
536,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
537,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""All too weak for childish pastimes,"
538,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Drearily the hours sped;
539,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,On his hands so small and trembling
540,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Leaning his poor aching head,"
541,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Or, through dark and painful hours,"
542,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Lying sleepless on his bed.
543,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
544,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""Dreaming strange and longing fancies"
545,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Of cool forests far away;
546,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"And of rosy, happy children,"
547,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Laughing merrily at play,"
548,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Coming home through green lanes, bearing"
549,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Trailing boughs of blooming May.
550,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
551,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""Scarce a glimpse of azure heaven"
552,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Gleamed above that narrow street,"
553,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,And the sultry air of Summer
554,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,(That you call so warm and sweet)
555,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Fevered the poor Orphan, dwelling"
556,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,In the crowded alley's heat.
557,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
558,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""One bright day, with feeble footsteps"
559,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Slowly forth he tried to crawl,"
560,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Through the crowded city's pathways,"
561,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Till he reached a garden-wall;
562,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Where 'mid princely halls and mansions
563,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Stood the lordliest of all.
564,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
565,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""There were trees with giant branches,"
566,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Velvet glades where shadows hide;
567,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"There were sparkling fountains glancing,"
568,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Flowers, which in luxuriant pride"
569,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Even wafted breaths of perfume
570,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,To the child who stood outside.
571,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
572,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""He against the gate of iron"
573,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Pressed his wan and wistful face,"
574,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Gazing with an awe-struck pleasure
575,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,At the glories of the place;
576,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Never had his brightest day-dream
577,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Shone with half such wondrous grace.
578,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
579,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""You were playing in that garden,"
580,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Throwing blossoms in the air,"
581,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Laughing when the petals floated
582,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Downwards on your golden hair;
583,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"And the fond eyes watching o'er you,"
584,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"And the splendour spread before you,"
585,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Told a House's Hope was there.
586,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
587,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""When your servants, tired of seeing"
588,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Such a face of want and woe,"
589,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Turning to the ragged Orphan,"
590,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Gave him coin, and bade him go,"
591,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Down his cheeks so thin and wasted,"
592,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Bitter tears began to flow.
593,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
594,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""But that look of childish sorrow"
595,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"On your tender child-heart fell,"
596,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,And you plucked the reddest roses
597,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"From the tree you loved so well,"
598,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Passed them through the stern cold grating,"
599,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Gently bidding him 'Farewell!'
600,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
601,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""Dazzled by the fragrant treasure"
602,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"And the gentle voice he heard,"
603,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"In the poor forlorn boy's spirit,"
604,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Joy, the sleeping Seraph, stirred;"
605,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"In his hand he took the flowers,"
606,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,In his heart the loving word.
607,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
608,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""So he crept to his poor garret;"
609,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Poor no more, but rich and bright,"
610,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,For the holy dreams of childhood--
611,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Love, and Rest, and Hope, and Light--"
612,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Floated round the Orphan's pillow
613,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Through the starry summer night.
614,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
615,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""Day dawned, yet the visions lasted;"
616,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,All too weak to rise he lay;
617,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Did he dream that none spake harshly--
618,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,All were strangely kind that day?
619,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Surely then his treasured roses
620,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Must have charmed all ills away.
621,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
622,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""And he smiled, though they were fading;"
623,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,One by one their leaves were shed;
624,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"'Such bright things could never perish,"
625,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"They would bloom again,' he said."
626,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,When the next day's sun had risen
627,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Child and flowers both were dead.
628,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
629,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""Know, dear little one! our Father"
630,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Will no gentle deed disdain;
631,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Love on the cold earth beginning
632,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Lives divine in Heaven again,"
633,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,While the angel hearts that beat there
634,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Still all tender thoughts retain."""
635,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
636,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"So the angel ceased, and gently"
637,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,O'er his little burthen leant;
638,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"While the child gazed from the shining,"
639,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Loving eyes that o'er him bent,"
640,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"To the blooming roses by him,"
641,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,Wondering what that mystery meant.
642,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,
643,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Thus the radiant angel answered,"
644,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,And with tender meaning smiled:
645,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"""Ere your childlike, loving spirit,"
646,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"Sin and the hard world defiled,"
647,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,God has given me leave to seek you--
648,VERSE: THE ANGEL'S STORY,"I was once that little child!"""

1529,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"I have seen a fiercer tempest,"
1530,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Known a louder whirlwind blow;
1531,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"I was wrecked off red Algiers,"
1532,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Six-and-thirty years ago.
1533,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Young I was, and yet old seamen"
1534,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Were not strong or calm as I;
1535,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"While life held such treasures for me,"
1536,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,I felt sure I could not die.
1537,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1538,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Life I struggled for--and saved it;
1539,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Life alone--and nothing more;
1540,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Bruised, half dead, alone and helpless,"
1541,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,I was cast upon the shore.
1542,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,I feared the pitiless rocks of Ocean;
1543,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,So the great sea rose--and then
1544,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Cast me from her friendly bosom,"
1545,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,On the pitiless hearts of men.
1546,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1547,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Gaunt and dreary ran the mountains,"
1548,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"With black gorges, up the land;"
1549,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Up to where the lonely Desert
1550,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Spreads her burning, dreary sand:"
1551,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"In the gorges of the mountains,"
1552,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"On the plain beside the sea,"
1553,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Dwelt my stern and cruel masters,"
1554,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,The black Moors of Barbary.
1555,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1556,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Ten long years I toiled among them,"
1557,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Hopeless--as I used to say;
1558,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Now I know Hope burnt within me
1559,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Fiercer, stronger, day by day:"
1560,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Those dim years of toil and sorrow
1561,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Like one long dark dream appear;
1562,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,One long day of weary waiting--
1563,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Then each day was like a year.
1564,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1565,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,How I cursed the land--my prison;
1566,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,How I cursed the serpent sea--
1567,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,And the Demon Fate that showered
1568,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,All her curses upon me;
1569,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"I was mad, I think--God pardon"
1570,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Words so terrible and wild--
1571,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"This voyage would have been my last one,"
1572,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,For I left a wife and child.
1573,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1574,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Never did one tender vision
1575,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Fade away before my sight,"
1576,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Never once through all my slavery,"
1577,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Burning day or dreary night;
1578,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"In my soul it lived, and kept me,"
1579,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Now I feel, from black despair,"
1580,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"And my heart was not quite broken,"
1581,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,While they lived and blest me there.
1582,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1583,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"When at night my task was over,"
1584,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,I would hasten to the shore;
1585,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"(All was strange and foreign inland,"
1586,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Nothing I had known before;)
1587,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Strange looked the bleak mountain passes,"
1588,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Strange the red glare and black shade,"
1589,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"And the Oleanders, waving"
1590,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,To the sound the fountains made.
1591,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1592,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Then I gazed at the great Ocean,"
1593,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Till she grew a friend again;
1594,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"And because she knew old England,"
1595,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,I forgave her all my pain:
1596,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"So the blue still sky above me,"
1597,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"With its white clouds' fleecy fold,"
1598,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"And the glimmering stars, (though brighter,)"
1599,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Looked like home and days of old.
1600,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1601,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"And a calm would fall upon me,"
1602,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Worn perhaps with work and pain,"
1603,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"The wild hungry longing left me,"
1604,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,And I was myself again:
1605,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Looking at the silver waters,"
1606,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Looking up at the far sky,"
1607,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Dreams of home and all I left there
1608,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Floated sorrowfully by.
1609,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1610,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"A fair face, but pale with sorrow,"
1611,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"With blue eyes, brimful of tears,"
1612,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"And the little red mouth, quivering"
1613,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"With a smile, to hide its fears;"
1614,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Holding out her baby towards me,"
1615,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,From the sky she looked on me;
1616,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"So it was that last I saw her,"
1617,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,As the ship put out to sea.
1618,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1619,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Sometimes, (and a pang would seize me"
1620,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"That the years were floating on,)"
1621,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"I would strive to paint her, altered,"
1622,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,And the little baby gone:
1623,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"She no longer young and girlish,"
1624,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"The child, standing by her knee,"
1625,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"And her face, more pale and saddened"
1626,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,With the weariness for me.
1627,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1628,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Then I saw, as night grew darker."
1629,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"How she taught my child to pray,"
1630,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Holding its small hands together,"
1631,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"For its father, far away;"
1632,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"And I felt her sorrow, weighing"
1633,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Heavier on me than my own;
1634,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Pitying her blighted spring-time,"
1635,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,And her joy so early flown.
1636,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1637,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Till upon my hands (now hardened
1638,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"With the rough, harsh toil of years)"
1639,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Bitter drops of anguish falling,"
1640,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Woke me from my dream, to tears;"
1641,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Woke me as a slave, an outcast."
1642,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Leagues from home, across the deep;"
1643,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,So--though you may call it childish--
1644,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,So I sobbed myself to sleep.
1645,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1646,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Well, the years sped on--my Sorrow,"
1647,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Calmer, and yet stronger grown,"
1648,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Was my shield against all suffering,"
1649,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Poorer, meaner, than her own."
1650,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Thus my cruel master's harshness
1651,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Fell upon me all in vain,"
1652,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Yet the tale of what we suffered
1653,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Echoed back from main to main.
1654,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1655,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,You have heard in a far country
1656,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Of a self-devoted band,"
1657,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Vowed to rescue Christian captives
1658,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Pining in a foreign land.
1659,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,And these gentle-hearted strangers
1660,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Year by year go forth from Rome,"
1661,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"In their hands the hard-earned ransom,"
1662,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,To restore some exiles home.
1663,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1664,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,I was freed: they broke the tidings
1665,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Gently to me: but indeed
1666,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Hour by hour sped on, I knew not"
1667,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,What the words meant--I was freed!
1668,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Better so, perhaps; while sorrow"
1669,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,(More akin to earthly things)
1670,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Only strains the sad heart's fibres--
1671,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Joy, bright stranger, breaks the strings."
1672,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1673,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Yet at last it rushed upon me,"
1674,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,And my heart beat full and fast;
1675,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"What were now my years of waiting,"
1676,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,What was all the dreary past?
1677,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Nothing--to the impatient throbbing
1678,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,I must bear across the sea:
1679,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Nothing--to the eternal hours
1680,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Still between my home and me!
1681,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1682,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"How the voyage passed, I know not;"
1683,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Strange it was once more to stand
1684,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"With my countrymen around me,"
1685,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,And to clasp an English hand.
1686,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"But, through all, my heart was dreaming"
1687,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Of the first words I should hear,"
1688,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"In the gentle voice that echoed,"
1689,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Fresh as ever, on my ear."
1690,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1691,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Should I see her start of wonder,"
1692,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"And the sudden truth arise,"
1693,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Flushing all her face and lightening
1694,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,The dimmed splendour of her eyes?
1695,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Oh! to watch the fear and doubting
1696,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Stir the silent depths of pain,"
1697,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,And the rush of joy--then melting
1698,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Into perfect peace again.
1699,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1700,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,And the child!--but why remember
1701,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Foolish fancies that I thought?
1702,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Every tree and every hedge-row
1703,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,From the well-known past I brought:
1704,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"I would picture my dear cottage,"
1705,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"See the crackling wood-fire burn,"
1706,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"And the two beside it seated,"
1707,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Watching, waiting, my return."
1708,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1709,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"So, at last we reached the harbour."
1710,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,I remember nothing more
1711,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Till I stood, my sick heart throbbing,"
1712,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,With my hand upon the door.
1713,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,There I paused--I heard her speaking;
1714,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Low, soft, murmuring words she said;"
1715,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Then I first knew the dumb terror
1716,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"I had had, lest she were dead."
1717,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1718,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"It was evening in late autumn,"
1719,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,And the gusty wind blew chill;
1720,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Autumn leaves were falling round me,"
1721,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,And the red sun lit the hill.
1722,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Six-and-twenty years are vanished
1723,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Since then--I am old and grey,"
1724,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,But I never told to mortal
1725,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"What I saw, until this day."
1726,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1727,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"She was seated by the fire,"
1728,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"In her arms she held a child,"
1729,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Whispering baby-words caressing,"
1730,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"And then, looking up, she smiled:"
1731,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Smiled on him who stood beside her--
1732,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Oh! the bitter truth was told,"
1733,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,In her look of trusting fondness--
1734,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,I had seen the look of old!
1735,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1736,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,But she rose and turned towards me
1737,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,(Cold and dumb I waited there)
1738,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"With a shriek of fear and terror,"
1739,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,And a white face of despair.
1740,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,He had been an ancient comrade--
1741,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Not a single word we said,"
1742,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"While we gazed upon each other,"
1743,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,He the living: I the dead!
1744,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1745,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"I drew nearer, nearer to her,"
1746,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"And I took her trembling hand,"
1747,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Looking on her white face, looking"
1748,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,That her heart might understand
1749,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,All the love and all the pity
1750,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,That my lips refused to say--
1751,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,I thank God no thought save sorrow
1752,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Rose in our crushed hearts that day.
1753,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1754,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Bitter tears that desolate moment,"
1755,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Bitter, bitter tears we wept,"
1756,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"We three broken hearts together,"
1757,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,While the baby smiled and slept.
1758,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Tears alone--no words were spoken,"
1759,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Till he--till her husband said
1760,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"That my boy, (I had forgotten"
1761,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"The poor child,) that he was dead."
1762,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1763,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Then at last I rose, and, turning,"
1764,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Wrung his hand, but made no sign;"
1765,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,And I stooped and kissed her forehead
1766,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Once more, as if she were mine."
1767,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Nothing of farewell I uttered,"
1768,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Save in broken words to pray
1769,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,That God would ever guard and bless her--
1770,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Then in silence passed away.
1771,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,
1772,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Over the great restless ocean
1773,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Six-and-twenty years I roam;
1774,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"All my comrades, old and weary,"
1775,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,Have gone back to die at home.--
1776,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"Home! yes, I shall reach a haven,"
1777,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,"I, too, shall reach home and rest;"
1778,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,I shall find her waiting for me
1779,VERSE: HOMEWARD BOUND,With our baby on her breast.

2267,VERSE: GOD'S GIFTS,Nourished the blue and dawning hours.
2268,VERSE: GOD'S GIFTS,
2269,VERSE: GOD'S GIFTS,"She shed, in rainbow hues of light,"
2270,VERSE: GOD'S GIFTS,"A halo round the Good and Right,"
2271,VERSE: GOD'S GIFTS,To tempt and charm the baby's sight.
2272,VERSE: GOD'S GIFTS,
2273,VERSE: GOD'S GIFTS,"And every step, of work or play."
2274,VERSE: GOD'S GIFTS,"Was lit by some such dazzling ray,"
2275,VERSE: GOD'S GIFTS,Till morning brightened into day.
2276,VERSE: GOD'S GIFTS,
2277,VERSE: GOD'S GIFTS,"And then the World arose, and said--"
2278,VERSE: GOD'S GIFTS,Let added honours now be shed
2279,VERSE: GOD'S GIFTS,On such a noble heart and head!
2280,VERSE: GOD'S GIFTS,
2281,VERSE: GOD'S GIFTS,"O World, both gifts were pure and bright,"
2282,VERSE: GOD'S GIFTS,Holy and sacred in God's sight:-

2288,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT
2289,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,
2290,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,
2291,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"A smiling look she had, a figure slight,"
2292,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"With cheerful air, and step both quick and light;"
2293,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"A strange and foreign look the maiden bore,"
2294,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,That suited the quaint Belgian dress she wore
2295,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Yet the blue fearless eyes in her fair face,"
2296,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,And her soft voice told her of English race;
2297,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And ever, as she flitted to and fro,"
2298,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"She sang, (or murmured, rather,) soft and low,"
2299,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Snatches of song, as if she did not know"
2300,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"That she was singing, but the happy load"
2301,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Of dream and thought thus from her heart o'erflowed:
2302,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And while on household cares she passed along,"
2303,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,The air would bear me fragments of her song;
2304,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Not such as village maidens sing, and few"
2305,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,The framers of her changing music knew;
2306,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Chants such as heaven and earth first heard of when
2307,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,The master Palestrina held the pen.
2308,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"But I with awe had often turned the page,"
2309,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Yellow with time, and half defaced by age,"
2310,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And listened, with an ear not quite unskilled,"
2311,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,While heart and soul to the grand echo thrilled;
2312,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And much I marvelled, as her cadence fell"
2313,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"From the Laudate, that I knew so well,"
2314,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Into Scarlatti's minor fugue, how she"
2315,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Had learned such deep and solemn harmony.
2316,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"But what she told I set in rhyme, as meet"
2317,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"To chronicle the influence, dim and sweet,"
2318,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,'Neath which her young and innocent life had grown:
2319,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Would that my words were simple as her own.
2320,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,
2321,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Many years since, an English workman went"
2322,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Over the seas, to seek a home in Ghent,"
2323,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Where English skill was prized; nor toiled in vain;
2324,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Small, yet enough, his hard-earned daily gain."
2325,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"He dwelt alone--in sorrow, or in pride."
2326,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,He mixed not with the workers by his side;
2327,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,He seemed to care but for one present joy--
2328,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"To tend, to watch, to teach his sickly boy."
2329,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Severe to all beside, yet for the child"
2330,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,He softened his rough speech to soothings mild;
2331,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"For him he smiled, with him each day he walked"
2332,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Through the dark gloomy streets; to him he talked
2333,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Of home, of England, and strange stories told"
2334,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Of English heroes in the days of old;
2335,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And, (when the sunset gilded roof and spire,)"
2336,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,The marvellous tale which never seemed to tire:
2337,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"How the gilt dragon, glaring fiercely down"
2338,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"From the great belfry, watching all the town,"
2339,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Was brought, a trophy of the wars divine,"
2340,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"By a Crusader from far Palestine,"
2341,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And given to Bruges; and how Ghent arose,"
2342,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And how they struggled long as deadly foes,"
2343,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Till Ghent, one night, by a brave soldier's skill,"
2344,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Stole the great dragon; and she keeps it still.
2345,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"One day the dragon--so 'tis said--will rise,"
2346,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Spread his bright wines, and glitter in the skies."
2347,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And over desert lands and azure seas,"
2348,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Will seek his home 'mid palm and cedar trees.
2349,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"So, as he passed the belfry every day,"
2350,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,The boy would look if it were flown away;
2351,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Each day surprised to find it watching there,"
2352,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Above him, as he crossed the ancient square,"
2353,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"To seek the great cathedral, that had grown"
2354,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,A home for him--mysterious and his own.
2355,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,
2356,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Dim with dark shadows of the ages past,"
2357,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"St. Bavon stands, solemn and rich and vast;"
2358,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"The slender pillars, in long vistas spread,"
2359,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Like forest arches meet and close o'erhead;
2360,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"So high that, like a weak and doubting prayer,"
2361,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Ere it can float to the carved angels there,"
2362,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,The silver clouded incense faints in air:
2363,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Only the organ's voice, with peal on peal,"
2364,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Can mount to where those far-off angels kneel.
2365,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Here the pale boy, beneath a low side-arch,"
2366,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Would listen to its solemn chant or march;
2367,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Folding his little hands, his simple prayer"
2368,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Melted in childish dreams, and both in air:"
2369,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"While the great organ over all would roll,"
2370,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Speaking strange secrets to his innocent soul,"
2371,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Bearing on eagle-wings the great desire
2372,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Of all the kneeling throng, and piercing higher"
2373,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Than aught but love and prayer can reach, until"
2374,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Only the silence seemed to listen still;
2375,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Or gathering like a sea still more and more,"
2376,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Break in melodious waves at heaven's door,"
2377,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And then fall, slow and soft, in tender rain,"
2378,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Upon the pleading longing hearts again.
2379,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,
2380,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Then he would watch the rosy sunlight glow,"
2381,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"That crept along the marble floor below,"
2382,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Passing, as life does, with the passing hours,"
2383,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Now by a shrine all rich with gems and flowers,"
2384,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Now on the brazen letters of a tomb,"
2385,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Then, leaving it again to shade and gloom,"
2386,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And creeping on, to show, distinct and quaint,"
2387,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,The kneeling figure of some marble saint:
2388,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Or lighting up the carvings strange and rare,"
2389,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"That told of patient toil, and reverent care;"
2390,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Ivy that trembled on the spray, and ears,"
2391,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Of heavy corn, and slender bulrush spears,"
2392,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,And all the thousand tangled weeds that grow
2393,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"In summer, where the silver rivers flow;"
2394,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And demon-heads grotesque, that seemed to glare"
2395,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,In impotent wrath on all the beauty there:
2396,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Then the gold rays up pillared shaft would climb,"
2397,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And so be drawn to heaven, at evening time."
2398,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And deeper silence, darker shadows flowed"
2399,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"On all around, only the windows glowed"
2400,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"With blazoned glory, like the shields of light"
2401,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Archangels bear, who, armed with love and might,"
2402,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Watch upon heaven's battlements at night.
2403,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Then all was shade; the silver lamps that gleamed,"
2404,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Lost in the daylight, in the darkness seemed"
2405,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Like sparks of fire in the dim aisles to shine,"
2406,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Or trembling stars before each separate shrine.
2407,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Grown half afraid, the child would leave them there,"
2408,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And come out, blinded by the noisy glare"
2409,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,That burst upon him from the busy square.
2410,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,
2411,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"The church was thus his home for rest or play,"
2412,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And as he came and went again each day,"
2413,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"The pictured faces that he knew so well,"
2414,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Seemed to smile on him welcome and farewell.
2415,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"But holier, and dearer far than all,"
2416,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,One sacred spot his own he loved to call;
2417,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Save at mid-day, half-hidden by the gloom;"
2418,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,The people call it The White Maiden's Tomb:
2419,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,For there she stands; her folded hands are pressed
2420,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Together, and laid softly on her breast,"
2421,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,As if she waited but a word to rise
2422,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"From the dull earth, and pass to the blue skies;"
2423,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Her lips expectant part, she holds her breath,"
2424,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,As listening for the angel voice of death.
2425,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"None know how many years have seen her so,"
2426,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Or what the name of her who sleeps below.
2427,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And here the child would come, and strive to trace,"
2428,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Through the dim twilight, the pure gentle face"
2429,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"He loved so well, and here he oft would bring"
2430,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Some violet blossom of the early spring;
2431,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And climbing softly by the fretted stand,"
2432,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Not to disturb her, lay it in her hand;"
2433,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Or, whispering a soft loving message sweet,"
2434,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Would stoop and kiss the little marble feet.
2435,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"So, when the organ's pealing music rang,"
2436,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,He thought amid the gloom the Maiden sang;
2437,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"With reverent simple faith by her he knelt,"
2438,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And fancied what she thought, and what she felt."
2439,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"""Glory to God,"" re-echoed from her voice,"
2440,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,And then his little spirit would rejoice;
2441,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Or when the Requiem sobbed upon the air,"
2442,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,His baby tears dropped with her mournful prayer.
2443,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,
2444,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"So years fled on, while childish fancies past,"
2445,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,The childish love and simple faith could last.
2446,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"The artist-soul awoke in him, the flame"
2447,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Of genius, like the light of Heaven, came"
2448,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Upon his brain, and (as it will, if true)"
2449,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"It touched his heart and lit his spirit, too"
2450,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"His father saw, and with a proud content"
2451,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Let him forsake the toil where he had spent
2452,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"His youth's first years, and on one happy day"
2453,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Of pride, before the old man passed away,"
2454,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"He stood with quivering lips, and the big tears"
2455,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Upon his cheek, and heard the dream of years"
2456,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Living and speaking to his very heart--
2457,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,The low hushed murmur at the wondrous art
2458,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Of him, who with young trembling fingers made"
2459,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,The great church-organ answer as he played;
2460,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And, as the uncertain sound grew full and strong,"
2461,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Rush with harmonious spirit-wings along,"
2462,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,And thrill with master-power the breathless throng.
2463,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,
2464,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"The old man died, and years passed on, and still"
2465,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,The young musician bent his heart and will
2466,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,To his dear toil.  St. Bavon now had grown
2467,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"More dear to him, and even more his own;"
2468,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,And as he left it every night he prayed
2469,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"A moment by the archway in the shade,"
2470,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Kneeling once more within the sacred gloom
2471,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Where the White Maiden watched upon her tomb.
2472,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"His hopes of travel and a world-wide fame,"
2473,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Cold Time had sobered, and his fragile frame;"
2474,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Content at last only in dreams to roam,"
2475,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Away from the tranquillity of home;
2476,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Content that the poor dwellers by his side
2477,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Saw in him but the gentle friend and guide,"
2478,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,The patient counsellor in the poor strife
2479,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And petty details of their common life,"
2480,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Who comforted where woe and grief might fall,"
2481,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Nor slighted any pain or want as small,"
2482,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,But whose great heart took in and felt for all.
2483,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,
2484,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Still he grew famous--many came to be
2485,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,His pupils in the art of harmony.
2486,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,One day a voice floated so pure and free
2487,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Above his music, that he turned to see"
2488,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"What angel sang, and saw before his eyes,"
2489,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"What made his heart leap with a strange surprise,"
2490,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"His own White Maiden, calm, and pure, and mild,"
2491,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,As in his childish dreams she sang and smiled;
2492,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Her eyes raised up to Heaven, her lips apart,"
2493,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,And music overflowing from her heart.
2494,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,But the faint blush that tinged her cheek betrayed
2495,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"No marble statue, but a living maid;"
2496,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Perplexed and startled at his wondering look,"
2497,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Her rustling score of Mozart's Sanctus shook;
2498,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"The uncertain notes, like birds within a snare,"
2499,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Fluttered and died upon the trembling air.
2500,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,
2501,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Days passed; each morning saw the maiden stand,"
2502,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Her eyes cast down, her lesson in her hand,"
2503,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Eager to study, never weary, while"
2504,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Repaid by the approving word or smile
2505,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Of her kind master; days and months fled on;
2506,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,One day the pupil from the choir was gone;
2507,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Gone to take light, and joy, and youth once more,"
2508,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Within the poor musician's humble door;
2509,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And to repay, with gentle happy art,"
2510,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,The debt so many owed his generous heart.
2511,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And now, indeed, was one who knew and felt"
2512,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,That a great gift of God within him dwelt;
2513,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"One who could listen, who could understand,"
2514,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Whose idle work dropped from her slackened hand,"
2515,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"While with wet eyes entranced she stood, nor knew"
2516,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,How the melodious winged hours flew;
2517,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Who loved his art as none had loved before,"
2518,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Yet prized the noble tender spirit more.
2519,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,While the great organ brought from far and near
2520,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Lovers of harmony to praise and hear,"
2521,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Unmarked by aught save what filled every day,"
2522,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Duty, and toil, and rest, years passed away:"
2523,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,And now by the low archway in the shade
2524,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Beside her mother knelt a little maid,"
2525,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Who, through the great cathedral learned to roam,"
2526,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Climb to the choir, and bring her father home;"
2527,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And stand, demure and solemn by his side,"
2528,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Patient till the last echo softly died;
2529,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Then place her little hand in his, and go"
2530,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Down the dark winding stair to where below
2531,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"The mother knelt, within the gathering gloom"
2532,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Waiting and praying by the Maiden's Tomb.
2533,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,
2534,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"So their life went, until, one winter's day,"
2535,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Father and child came there alone to pray--
2536,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"The mother, gentle soul, had fled away!"
2537,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Their life was altered now, and yet the child"
2538,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Forgot her passionate grief in time, and smiled,"
2539,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Half wondering why, when spring's fresh breezes came,"
2540,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,To see her father was no more the same.
2541,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Half guessing at the shadow of his pain,"
2542,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And then contented if he smiled again,"
2543,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"A sad cold smile, that passed in tears away,"
2544,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,As re-assured she ran once more to play.
2545,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And now each year that added grace to grace,"
2546,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Fresh bloom and sunshine to the young girl's face,"
2547,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Brought a strange light in the musician's eyes,"
2548,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"As if he saw some starry hope arise,"
2549,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Breaking upon the midnight of sad skies.
2550,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"It might be so: more feeble year by year,"
2551,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,The wanderer to his resting-place drew near.
2552,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"One day the Gloria he could play no more,"
2553,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Echoed its grand rejoicing as of yore;
2554,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"His hands were clasped, his weary head was laid,"
2555,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Upon the tomb where the White Maiden prayed:
2556,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Where the child's love first dawned, his soul first spoke,"
2557,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,The old man's heart there throbbed its last and broke.
2558,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"The grave cathedral that had nursed his youth,"
2559,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Had helped his dreaming, and had taught him truth,"
2560,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Had seen his boyish grief and baby tears,"
2561,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"And watched the sorrows and the joys of years,"
2562,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Had lit his fame and hope with sacred rays,"
2563,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,And consecrated sad and happy days--
2564,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Had blessed his happiness, and soothed his pain,"
2565,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Now took her faithful servant home again.
2566,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,
2567,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,He rests in peace: some travellers mention yet
2568,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,An organist whose name they all forget.
2569,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,He has a holier and a nobler fame
2570,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"By poor men's hearths, who love and bless the name"
2571,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Of a kind friend; and in low tones to-day,"
2572,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,Speak tenderly of him who passed away.
2573,VERSE: A TOMB IN GHENT,"Too poor to help the daughter of their friend,"

2968,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,From the wayside well below;
2969,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Where children, drawing water,"
2970,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Looked up and paused to see,"
2971,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Amid the apple-branches,"
2972,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,A purple Judas Tree.
2973,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
2974,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,The road stretched winding onward
2975,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,For many a weary mile--
2976,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,So dusty foot-sore wanderers
2977,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Would pause and rest awhile;
2978,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"And panting horses halted,"
2979,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,And travellers loved to tell
2980,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"The quiet of the wayside inn,"
2981,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"The orchard, and the well."
2982,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
2983,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Here Maurice dwelt; and often
2984,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,The sunburnt boy would stand
2985,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Gazing upon the distance,"
2986,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,And shading with his hand
2987,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"His eyes, while watching vainly"
2988,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"For travellers, who might need"
2989,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"His aid to loose the bridle,"
2990,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,And tend the weary steed.
2991,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
2992,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,And once (the boy remembered
2993,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"That morning, many a day--"
2994,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"The dew lay on the hawthorn,"
2995,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,The bird sang on the spray)
2996,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"A train of horsemen, nobler"
2997,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Than he had seen before,"
2998,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Up from the distance galloped,"
2999,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,And halted at the door.
3000,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
3001,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Upon a milk-white pony,"
3002,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Fit for a faery queen,"
3003,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Was the loveliest little damsel
3004,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,His eyes had ever seen:
3005,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,A serving-man was holding
3006,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"The leading rein, to guide"
3007,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"The pony and its mistress,"
3008,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Who cantered by his side.
3009,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
3010,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Her sunny ringlets round her
3011,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"A golden cloud had made,"
3012,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,While her large hat was keeping
3013,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Her calm blue eyes in shade;
3014,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,One hand held fast the silken reins
3015,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"To keep her steed in check,"
3016,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"The other pulled his tangled mane,"
3017,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Or stroked his glossy neck.
3018,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
3019,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"And as the boy brought water,"
3020,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"And loosed the rein, he heard"
3021,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,The sweetest voice that thanked him
3022,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,In one low gentle word;
3023,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"She turned her blue eyes from him,"
3024,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Looked up, and smiled to see"
3025,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,The hanging purple blossoms
3026,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Upon the Judas Tree;
3027,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
3028,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"And showed it with a gesture,"
3029,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Half pleading, half command,"
3030,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Till he broke the fairest blossom,"
3031,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,And laid it in her hand;
3032,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,And she tied it to her saddle
3033,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"With a ribbon from her hair,"
3034,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"While her happy laugh rang gaily,"
3035,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Like silver on the air.
3036,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
3037,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,But the champing steeds were rested--
3038,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"The horsemen now spurred on,"
3039,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,And down the dusty highway
3040,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,They vanished and were gone.
3041,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Years passed, and many a traveller"
3042,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Paused at the old inn-door,"
3043,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,But the little milk-white pony
3044,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,And the child returned no more.
3045,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
3046,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Years passed, the apple-branches"
3047,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,A deeper shadow shed;
3048,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"And many a time the Judas Tree,"
3049,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Blossom and leaf, lay dead;"
3050,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,When on the loitering western breeze
3051,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Came the bells' merry sound,"
3052,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"And flowery arches rose, and flags"
3053,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,And banners waved around.
3054,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
3055,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Maurice stood there expectant:
3056,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,The bridal train would stay
3057,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Some moments at the inn-door,"
3058,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,The eager watchers say;
3059,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,They come--the cloud of dust draws near--
3060,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"'Mid all the state and pride,"
3061,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,He only sees the golden hair
3062,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,And blue eyes of the bride.
3063,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
3064,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"The same, yet, ah, still fairer;"
3065,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,He knew the face once more
3066,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,That bent above the pony's neck
3067,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Years past at that inn-door:
3068,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Her shy and smiling eyes looked round,"
3069,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Unconscious of the place,"
3070,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Unconscious of the eager gaze
3071,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,He fixed upon her face.
3072,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
3073,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,He plucked a blossom from the tree--
3074,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,The Judas Tree--and cast
3075,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Its purple fragrance towards the Bride,"
3076,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,A message from the Past.
3077,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"The signal came, the horses plunged--"
3078,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Once more she smiled around:
3079,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,The purple blossom in the dust
3080,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Lay trampled on the ground.
3081,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
3082,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Again the slow years fleeted,"
3083,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Their passage only known
3084,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,By the height the Passion-flower
3085,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Around the porch had grown;
3086,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,And many a passing traveller
3087,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Paused at the old inn-door,"
3088,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"But the bride, so fair and blooming,"
3089,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,The bride returned no more.
3090,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
3091,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"One winter morning, Maurice,"
3092,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Watching the branches bare,"
3093,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Rustling and waving dimly
3094,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"In the grey and misty air,"
3095,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Saw blazoned on a carriage
3096,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Once more the well-known shield,"
3097,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,The stars and azure fleurs-de-lis
3098,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Upon a silver field.
3099,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
3100,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"He looked--was that pale woman,"
3101,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"So grave, so worn, so sad,"
3102,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"The child, once young and smiling,"
3103,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"The bride, once fair and glad?"
3104,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"What grief had dimmed that glory,"
3105,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,And brought that dark eclipse
3106,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Upon her blue eyes' radiance,"
3107,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,And paled those trembling lips?
3108,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
3109,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"What memory of past sorrow,"
3110,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"What stab of present pain,"
3111,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Brought that deep look of anguish,"
3112,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"That watched the dismal rain,"
3113,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,That watched (with the absent spirit
3114,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"That looks, yet does not see)"
3115,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,The dead and leafless branches
3116,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Upon the Judas Tree.
3117,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
3118,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,The slow dark months crept onward
3119,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Upon their icy way,"
3120,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,'Till April broke in showers
3121,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,And Spring smiled forth in May;
3122,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Upon the apple-blossoms
3123,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"The sun shone bright again,"
3124,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,When slowly up the highway
3125,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Came a long funeral train.
3126,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
3127,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"The bells toiled slowly, sadly,"
3128,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,For a noble spirit fled;
3129,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Slowly, in pomp and honour,"
3130,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,They bore the quiet dead.
3131,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Upon a black-plumed charger
3132,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"One rode, who held a shield,"
3133,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Where stars and azure fleurs-de-lis
3134,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Shone on a silver field.
3135,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
3136,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,'Mid all that homage given
3137,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"To a fluttering heart at rest,"
3138,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Perhaps an honest sorrow
3139,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Dwelt only in one breast.
3140,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,One by the inn-door standing
3141,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Watched with fast-dropping tears
3142,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"The long procession passing,"
3143,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"And thought of bygone years,"
3144,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,
3145,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"The boyish, silent homage"
3146,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"To child and bride unknown,"
3147,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,The pitying tender sorrow
3148,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"Kept in his heart alone,"
3149,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Now laid upon the coffin
3150,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"With a purple flower, might be"
3151,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,Told to the cold dead sleeper;
3152,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,The rest could only see
3153,VERSE: THE WAYSIDE INN,"A fragrant purple blossom,"

3165,VERSE: VOICES OF THE PAST,My soul with joy and pain--

3172,VERSE: VOICES OF THE PAST,And thrill my soul to hear--
3173,VERSE: VOICES OF THE PAST,How can you tell what ancient charm
3174,VERSE: VOICES OF THE PAST,Has made me hold it dear?
3175,VERSE: VOICES OF THE PAST,
3176,VERSE: VOICES OF THE PAST,You marvel that I turn away

3181,VERSE: VOICES OF THE PAST,Breathes of a past delight.
3182,VERSE: VOICES OF THE PAST,
3183,VERSE: VOICES OF THE PAST,You smile to see me turn and speak

3186,VERSE: VOICES OF THE PAST,That with his voice arise--

3215,VERSE: THE DARK SIDE,
3216,VERSE: THE DARK SIDE,"Thou hast done well, perhaps,"

3218,VERSE: THE DARK SIDE,Dark threads of sin and self
3219,VERSE: THE DARK SIDE,With our best deeds are found.
3220,VERSE: THE DARK SIDE,"How great and noble hearts,"

3241,VERSE: THE DARK SIDE,
3242,VERSE: THE DARK SIDE,"The black stream flows along,"
3243,VERSE: THE DARK SIDE,Whose waters we despise--

3394,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3395,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3396,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,It is a dreary evening;
3397,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,The shadows rise and fall:
3398,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"With strange and ghostly changes,"
3399,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,They flicker on the wall.
3400,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3401,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Make the charred logs burn brighter;
3402,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"I will show you, by their blaze,"
3403,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,The half-forgotten record
3404,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Of bygone things and days.
3405,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3406,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Bring here the ancient volume;
3407,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"The clasp is old and worn,"
3408,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"The gold is dim and tarnished,"
3409,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,And the faded leaves are torn.
3410,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3411,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,The dust has gathered on it--
3412,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,There are so few who care
3413,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,To read what Time has written
3414,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Of joy and sorrow there.
3415,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3416,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Look at the first fair pages;
3417,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Yes--I remember all:
3418,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"The joys now seem so trivial,"
3419,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,The griefs so poor and small.
3420,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3421,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Let us read the dreams of glory
3422,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,That childish fancy made;
3423,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"Turn to the next few pages,"
3424,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,And see how soon they fade.
3425,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3426,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"Here, where still waiting, dreaming,"
3427,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"For some ideal Life,"
3428,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,The young heart all unconscious
3429,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Had entered on the strife.
3430,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3431,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,See how this page is blotted:
3432,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,What--could those tears be mine?
3433,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"How coolly I can read you,"
3434,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Each blurred and trembling line.
3435,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3436,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"Now I can reason calmly,"
3437,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"And, looking back again,"
3438,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Can see divinest meaning
3439,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Threading each separate pain.
3440,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3441,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Here strong resolve--how broken;
3442,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"Rash hope, and foolish fear,"
3443,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"And prayers, which God in pity"
3444,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Refused to grant or hear.
3445,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3446,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Nay--I will turn the pages
3447,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,To where the tale is told
3448,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Of how a dawn diviner
3449,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Flushed the dark clouds with gold.
3450,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3451,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"And see, that light has gilded"
3452,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,The story--nor shall set;
3453,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"And, though in mist and shadow,"
3454,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,You know I see it yet.
3455,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3456,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"Here--well, it does not matter,"
3457,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,I promised to read all;
3458,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"I know not why I falter,"
3459,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Or why my tears should fall;
3460,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3461,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,You see each grief is noted;
3462,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Yet it was better so--
3463,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,I can rejoice to-day--the pain
3464,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"Was over, long ago."
3465,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3466,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"I read--my voice is failing,"
3467,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,But you can understand
3468,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,How the heart beat that guided
3469,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,This weak and trembling hand.
3470,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3471,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"Pass over that long struggle,"
3472,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"Read where the comfort came,"
3473,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Where the first time is written
3474,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Within the book your name.
3475,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3476,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"Again it comes, and oftener,"
3477,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"Linked, as it now must be,"
3478,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,With all the joy or sorrow
3479,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,That Life may bring to me.
3480,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3481,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,So all the rest--you know it:
3482,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"Now shut the clasp again,"
3483,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,And put aside the record
3484,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Of bygone hours of pain.
3485,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3486,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"The dust shall gather on it,"
3487,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,I will not read it more:
3488,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Give me your hand--what was it
3489,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,We were talking of before?
3490,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,
3491,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,I know not why--but tell me
3492,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,Of something gay and bright.
3493,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,"It is strange--my heart is heavy,"
3494,VERSE: MY JOURNAL,And my eyes are dim to-night.

3500,VERSE: A CHAIN,
3501,VERSE: A CHAIN,
3502,VERSE: A CHAIN,The bond that links our souls together;
3503,VERSE: A CHAIN,Will it last through stormy weather?
3504,VERSE: A CHAIN,Will it moulder and decay
3505,VERSE: A CHAIN,As the long hours pass away?
3506,VERSE: A CHAIN,"Will it stretch if Fate divide us,"
3507,VERSE: A CHAIN,When dark and weary hours have tried us?
3508,VERSE: A CHAIN,"Oh, if it look too poor and slight"
3509,VERSE: A CHAIN,Let us break the links to-night!
3510,VERSE: A CHAIN,
3511,VERSE: A CHAIN,"It was not forged by mortal hands,"
3512,VERSE: A CHAIN,Or clasped with golden bars and bands;
3513,VERSE: A CHAIN,"Save thine and mine, no other eyes"
3514,VERSE: A CHAIN,The slender link can recognise:
3515,VERSE: A CHAIN,In the bright light it seems to fade--
3516,VERSE: A CHAIN,And it is hidden in the shade;
3517,VERSE: A CHAIN,"While Heaven nor Earth have never heard,"
3518,VERSE: A CHAIN,"Or solemn vow, or plighted word."
3519,VERSE: A CHAIN,
3520,VERSE: A CHAIN,"Yet what no mortal hand could make,"
3521,VERSE: A CHAIN,No mortal power can ever break:
3522,VERSE: A CHAIN,"What words or vows could never do,"
3523,VERSE: A CHAIN,No words or vows can make untrue;
3524,VERSE: A CHAIN,And if to other hearts unknown
3525,VERSE: A CHAIN,"The dearer and the more our own,"
3526,VERSE: A CHAIN,Because too sacred and divine
3527,VERSE: A CHAIN,"For other eyes, save thine and mine."
3528,VERSE: A CHAIN,
3529,VERSE: A CHAIN,"And see, though slender, it is made"
3530,VERSE: A CHAIN,"Of Love and Trust, and can they fade?"
3531,VERSE: A CHAIN,"While, if too slight it seem, to bear"
3532,VERSE: A CHAIN,"The breathings of the summer air,"
3533,VERSE: A CHAIN,We know that it could bear the weight
3534,VERSE: A CHAIN,"Of a most heavy heart of late,"
3535,VERSE: A CHAIN,And as each day and hour flew
3536,VERSE: A CHAIN,The stronger for its burthen grew.
3537,VERSE: A CHAIN,
3538,VERSE: A CHAIN,"And, too, we know and feel again"
3539,VERSE: A CHAIN,"It has been sanctified by pain,"
3540,VERSE: A CHAIN,For what God deigns to try with sorrow
3541,VERSE: A CHAIN,He means not to decay to-morrow;
3542,VERSE: A CHAIN,But through that fiery trial last
3543,VERSE: A CHAIN,When earthly ties and bonds are past;
3544,VERSE: A CHAIN,What slighter things dare not endure
3545,VERSE: A CHAIN,Will make our Love more safe and pure.
3546,VERSE: A CHAIN,
3547,VERSE: A CHAIN,"Love shall be purified by Pain,"
3548,VERSE: A CHAIN,And Pain be soothed by Love again:
3549,VERSE: A CHAIN,So let us now take heart and go
3550,VERSE: A CHAIN,"Cheerfully on, through joy and woe;"
3551,VERSE: A CHAIN,"No change the summer sun can bring,"
3552,VERSE: A CHAIN,"Or the inconstant skies of spring,"
3553,VERSE: A CHAIN,"Or the bleak winter's stormy weather,"
3554,VERSE: A CHAIN,"For we shall meet them, Love, together!"

3642,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Shine back the starry skies;
3643,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"And, watching each white cloudlet"
3644,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Float silently and slow,"

3652,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"For Bregenz, that quaint city"
3653,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Upon the Tyrol shore,"
3654,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Has stood above Lake Constance,"
3655,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,A thousand years and more.
3656,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3657,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Her battlements and towers,"
3658,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"From off their rocky steep,"
3659,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Have cast their trembling shadow
3660,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,For ages on the deep:

3662,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"A sacred legend know,"
3663,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Of how the town was saved, one night,"

3665,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3666,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Far from her home and kindred,"
3667,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"A Tyrol maid had fled,"
3668,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"To serve in the Swiss valleys,"
3669,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,And toil for daily bread;
3670,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,And every year that fleeted
3671,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"So silently and fast,"
3672,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Seemed to bear farther from her
3673,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,The memory of the Past.
3674,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3675,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"She served kind, gentle masters,"

3678,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Their speech seemed no more strange;
3679,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,And when she led her cattle
3680,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"To pasture every day,"
3681,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,She ceased to look and wonder
3682,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,On which side Bregenz lay.
3683,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3684,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"She spoke no more of Bregenz,"
3685,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,With longing and with tears:
3686,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Her Tyrol home seemed faded
3687,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,In a deep mist of years;
3688,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,She heeded not the rumours

3691,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,To the calm toils of life.
3692,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3693,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Yet, when her master's children"

3695,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,She sang them ancient ballads
3696,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Of her own native land;
3697,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,And when at morn and evening
3698,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"She knelt before God's throne,"
3699,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,The accents of her childhood
3700,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Rose to her lips alone.
3701,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3702,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,And so she dwelt: the valley
3703,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,More peaceful year by year;
3704,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"When suddenly strange portents,"
3705,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Of some great deed seemed near.
3706,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,The golden corn was bending
3707,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Upon its fragile stalk,"
3708,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"While farmers, heedless of their fields,"
3709,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Paced up and down in talk.
3710,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3711,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"The men seemed stern and altered,"
3712,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,With looks cast on the ground;
3713,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"With anxious faces, one by one,"
3714,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,The women gathered round;
3715,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"All talk of flax, or spinning,"
3716,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Or work, was put away;"
3717,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,The very children seemed afraid
3718,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,To go alone to play.
3719,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3720,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"One day, out in the meadow"
3721,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"With strangers from the town,"
3722,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Some secret plan discussing,"
3723,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,The men walked up and down.
3724,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Yet, now and then seemed watching,"
3725,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"A strange uncertain gleam,"
3726,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"That looked like lances 'mid the trees,"
3727,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,That stood below the stream.
3728,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3729,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"At eve they all assembled,"
3730,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Then care and doubt were fled;
3731,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,With jovial laugh they feasted;
3732,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,The board was nobly spread.
3733,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,The elder of the village
3734,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Rose up, his glass in hand,"
3735,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"And cried, ""We drink the downfall"

3737,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3738,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"""The night is growing darker,"

3745,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Felt death within her heart.
3746,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3747,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Before her, stood fair Bregenz;"
3748,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Once more her towers arose;

3750,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Only her country's foes!
3751,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"The faces of her kinsfolk,"
3752,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"The days of childhood flown,"
3753,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"The echoes of her mountains,"
3754,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Reclaimed her as their own!

3759,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"The pasture, and the plain;"
3760,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Before her eyes one vision,"
3761,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"And in her heart one cry,"
3762,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"That said, ""Go forth, save Bregenz,"
3763,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"And then, if need be, die!"""
3764,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3765,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"With trembling haste and breathless,"
3766,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,With noiseless step she sped;
3767,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Horses and weary cattle
3768,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Were standing in the shed;
3769,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"She loosed the strong white charger,"
3770,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"That fed from out her hand,"
3771,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"She mounted, and she turned his head"
3772,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Towards her native land.
3773,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3774,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Out--out into the darkness--
3775,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Faster, and still more fast;"
3776,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"The smooth grass flies behind her,"
3777,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,The chestnut wood is past;
3778,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,She looks up; clouds are heavy:
3779,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Why is her steed so slow?--
3780,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Scarcely the wind beside them,"
3781,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Can pass them as they go.
3782,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3783,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"""Faster!"" she cries, ""Oh faster!"""
3784,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Eleven the church-bells chime:

3786,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"And bring me there in time!"""
3787,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"But louder than bells' ringing,"
3788,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Or lowing of the kine,"
3789,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Grows nearer in the midnight
3790,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,The rushing of the Rhine.
3791,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3792,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Shall not the roaring waters
3793,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Their headlong gallop check?
3794,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"The steed draws back in terror,"
3795,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,She leans upon his neck
3796,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,To watch the flowing darkness;
3797,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,The bank is high and steep;
3798,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"One pause--he staggers forward,"
3799,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,And plunges in the deep.
3800,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3801,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"She strives to pierce the blackness,"
3802,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,And looser throws the rein;
3803,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Her steed must breast the waters
3804,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,That dash above his mane.
3805,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"How gallantly, how nobly,"
3806,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"He struggles through the foam,"
3807,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"And see--in the far distance,"
3808,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Shine out the lights of home!
3809,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3810,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Up the steep banks he bears her,"
3811,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"And now, they rush again"
3812,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Towards the heights of Bregenz,"
3813,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,That tower above the plain.
3814,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"They reach the gate of Bregenz,"
3815,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Just as the midnight rings,"
3816,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,And out come serf and soldier
3817,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,To meet the news she brings.
3818,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3819,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Bregenz is saved!  Ere daylight
3820,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Her battlements are manned;
3821,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Defiance greets the army
3822,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,That marches on the land.
3823,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,And if to deeds heroic
3824,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Should endless fame be paid,"
3825,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,Bregenz does well to honour
3826,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,The noble Tyrol maid.
3827,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3828,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Three hundred years are vanished,"
3829,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,And yet upon the hill
3830,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"An old stone gateway rises,"
3831,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,To do her honour still.
3832,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"And there, when Bregenz women"
3833,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"Sit spinning in the shade,"
3834,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,They see in quaint old carving
3835,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,The Charger and the Maid.
3836,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,
3837,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"And when, to guard old Bregenz,"
3838,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"By gateway, street, and tower,"
3839,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"The warder paces all night long,"
3840,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,And calls each passing hour;
3841,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"""Nine,"" ""ten,"" ""eleven,"" he cries aloud,"
3842,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,And then (Oh crown of Fame!)
3843,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,"When midnight pauses in the skies,"
3844,VERSE: A LEGEND OF BREGENZ,He calls the maiden's name!

4170,VERSE: A SHADOW,A shadow is on the sun:
4171,VERSE: A SHADOW,"What lack the merry hours,"
4172,VERSE: A SHADOW,That I long that they were done?
4173,VERSE: A SHADOW,"Only two smiling eyes,"
4174,VERSE: A SHADOW,That told of joy and mirth:
4175,VERSE: A SHADOW,"They are shining in the skies,"
4176,VERSE: A SHADOW,I mourn on earth!
4177,VERSE: A SHADOW,
4178,VERSE: A SHADOW,"What lacks my heart, that makes it"
4179,VERSE: A SHADOW,"So weary and full of pain,"
4180,VERSE: A SHADOW,"That trembling Hope forsakes it,"
4181,VERSE: A SHADOW,Never to come again?
4182,VERSE: A SHADOW,"Only another heart,"
4183,VERSE: A SHADOW,"Tender and all mine own,"
4184,VERSE: A SHADOW,In the still grave it lies;
4185,VERSE: A SHADOW,I weep alone!
4186,VERSE: A SHADOW,

4191,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,
4192,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,
4193,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"My Life you ask of? why, you know"
4194,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Full soon my little Life is told;
4195,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"It has had no great joy or woe,"
4196,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,For I am only twelve years old.
4197,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Ere long I hope I shall have been
4198,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"On my first voyage, and wonders seen."
4199,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Some princess I may help to free
4200,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"From pirates, on a far-off sea;"
4201,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Or, on some desert isle be left,"
4202,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Of friends and shipmates all bereft.
4203,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,
4204,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"For the first time I venture forth,"
4205,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,From our blue mountains of the north.
4206,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,My kinsman kept the lodge that stood
4207,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Guarding the entrance near the wood,"
4208,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"By the stone gateway grey and old,"
4209,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"With quaint devices carved about,"
4210,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And broken shields; while dragons bold
4211,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Glared on the common world without;
4212,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And the long trembling ivy spray
4213,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Half hid the centuries' decay.
4214,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,In solitude and silence grand
4215,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,The castle towered above the land:
4216,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"The castle of the Earl, whose name"
4217,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,(Wrapped in old bloody legends) came
4218,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Down through the times when Truth and Right
4219,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Bent down to armed Pride and Might.
4220,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,He owned the country far and near;
4221,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And, for some weeks in every year,"
4222,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,(When the brown leaves were falling fast
4223,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And the long, lingering autumn passed,)"
4224,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"He would come down to hunt the deer,"
4225,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,With hound and horse in splendid pride.
4226,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"The story lasts the live-long year,"
4227,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"The peasant's winter evening fills,"
4228,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,When he is gone and they abide
4229,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,In the lone quiet of their hills.
4230,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,
4231,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"I longed, too, for the happy night,"
4232,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"When, all with torches flaring bright,"
4233,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"The crowding villagers would stand,"
4234,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"A patient, eager, waiting band,"
4235,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Until the signal ran like flame--
4236,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"""They come!"" and, slackening speed, they came."
4237,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Outriders first, in pomp and state,"
4238,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Pranced on their horses through the gate;
4239,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Then the four steeds as black as night,"
4240,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"All decked with trappings blue and white,"
4241,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Drew through the crowd that opened wide,"
4242,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,The Earl and Countess side by side.
4243,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"The stern grave Earl, with formal smile"
4244,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And glistening eyes and stately pride,"
4245,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Could ne'er my childish gaze beguile
4246,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,From the fair presence by his side.
4247,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"The lady's soft sad glance, her eyes,"
4248,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"(Like stars that shone in summer skies,)"
4249,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Her pure white face so calmly bent,"
4250,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,With gentle greetings round her sent
4251,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Her look, that always seemed to gaze"
4252,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Where the blue past had closed again
4253,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Over some happy shipwrecked days,"
4254,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,With all their freight of love and pain:
4255,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,She did not even seem to see
4256,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,The little lord upon her knee.
4257,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And yet he was like angel fair,"
4258,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"With rosy cheeks and golden hair,"
4259,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,That fell on shoulders white as snow:
4260,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,But the blue eyes that shone below
4261,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"His clustering rings of auburn curls,"
4262,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Were not his mother's, but the Earl's."
4263,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,
4264,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"I feared the Earl, so cold and grim,"
4265,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,I never dared be seen by him.
4266,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"When through our gate he used to ride,"
4267,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,My kinsman Walter bade me hide;
4268,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,He said he was so stern.
4269,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"So, when the hunt came past our way,"
4270,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"I always hastened to obey,"
4271,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Until I heard the bugles play
4272,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,The notes of their return.
4273,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,But she--my very heart-strings stir
4274,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Whene'er I speak or think of her--
4275,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,The whole wide world could never see
4276,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"A noble lady such as she,"
4277,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,So full of angel charity.
4278,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,
4279,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Strange things of her our neighbours told
4280,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"In the long winter evenings cold,"
4281,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Around the fire.  They would draw near
4282,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And speak half-whispering, as in fear;"
4283,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,As if they thought the Earl could hear
4284,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Their treason 'gainst his name.
4285,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,They thought the story that his pride
4286,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Had stooped to wed a low-born bride,"
4287,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,A stain upon his fame.
4288,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Some said 'twas false; there could not be
4289,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Such blot on his nobility:
4290,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,But others vowed that they had heard
4291,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"The actual story word for word,"
4292,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"From one who well my lady knew,"
4293,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And had declared the story true.
4294,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,
4295,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"In a far village, little known,"
4296,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,She dwelt--so ran the tale--alone.
4297,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"A widowed bride, yet, oh! so bright,"
4298,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Shone through the mist of grief, her charms;"
4299,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,They said it was the loveliest sight--
4300,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,She with her baby in her arms.
4301,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"The Earl, one summer morning, rode"
4302,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,By the sea-shore where she abode;
4303,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Again he came--that vision sweet
4304,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Drew him reluctant to her feet.
4305,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Fierce must the struggle in his heart
4306,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Have been, between his love and pride,"
4307,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Until he chose that wondrous part,"
4308,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,To ask her to become his bride.
4309,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Yet, ere his noble name she bore,"
4310,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,He made her vow that nevermore
4311,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"She would behold her child again,"
4312,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,But hide his name and hers from men.
4313,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"The trembling promise duly spoken,"
4314,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,All links of the low past were broken;
4315,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And she arose to take her stand
4316,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Amid the nobles of the land.
4317,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Then all would wonder--could it be
4318,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"That one so lowly born as she,"
4319,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Raised to such height of bliss, should seem"
4320,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Still living in some weary dream?
4321,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,'Tis true she bore with calmest grace
4322,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"The honours of her lofty place,"
4323,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Yet never smiled, in peace or joy,"
4324,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Not even to greet her princely boy.
4325,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"She heard, with face of white despair,"
4326,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"The cannon thunder through the air,"
4327,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,That she had given the Earl an heir.
4328,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Nay, even more, (they whispered low,"
4329,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"As if they scarce durst fancy so,)"
4330,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"That, through her lofty wedded life,"
4331,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"No word, no tone, betrayed the wife."
4332,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Her look seemed ever in the past;
4333,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Never to him it grew more sweet;
4334,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,The self-same weary glance she cast
4335,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Upon the grey-hound at her feet,"
4336,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"As upon him, who bade her claim"
4337,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,The crowning honour of his name.
4338,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,
4339,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"This gossip, if old Walter heard,"
4340,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,He checked it with a scornful word:
4341,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,I never durst such tales repeat;
4342,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,He was too serious and discreet
4343,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,To speak of what his lord might do;
4344,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Besides, he loved my lady too."
4345,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And many a time, I recollect,"
4346,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,They were together in the wood;
4347,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"He, with an air of grave respect,"
4348,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And earnest look, uncovered stood."
4349,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And though their speech I never heard,"
4350,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"(Save now and then a louder word,)"
4351,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,I saw he spake as none but one
4352,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"She loved and trusted, durst have done;"
4353,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,For oft I watched them in the shade
4354,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"That the close forest branches made,"
4355,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Till slanting golden sunbeams came
4356,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And smote the fir-trees into flame,"
4357,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"A radiant glory round her lit,"
4358,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Then down her white robes seemed to flit,"
4359,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Gilding the brown leaves on the ground,"
4360,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And all the waving ferns around.
4361,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,While by some gloomy pine she leant
4362,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And he in earnest talk would stand,"
4363,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"I saw the tear-drops, as she bent,"
4364,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Fall on the flowers in her hand.--
4365,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Strange as it seemed and seems to be,"
4366,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"That one so sad, so cold as she,"
4367,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Could love a little child like me--
4368,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Yet so it was.  I never heard
4369,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Such tender words as she would say,"
4370,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And murmurs, sweeter than a word,"
4371,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Would breathe upon me as I lay.
4372,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"While I, in smiling joy, would rest,"
4373,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"For hours, my head upon her breast."
4374,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Our neighbours said that none could see
4375,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"In me the common childish charms,"
4376,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"(So grave and still I used to be,)"
4377,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And yet she held me in her arms,"
4378,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"In a fond clasp, so close, so tight--"
4379,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,I often dream of it at night.
4380,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,She bade me tell her all--no other
4381,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,My childish thoughts e'er cared to know:
4382,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,For I--I never knew my mother;
4383,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,I was an orphan long ago.
4384,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And I could all my fancies pour,"
4385,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,That gentle loving face before.
4386,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,She liked to hear me tell her all;
4387,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"How that day I had climbed the tree,"
4388,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,To make the largest fir-cones fall;
4389,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And how one day I hoped to be
4390,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,A sailor on the deep blue sea--
4391,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,She loved to hear it all!
4392,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,
4393,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Then wondrous things she used to tell,"
4394,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Of the strange dreams that she had known.
4395,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"I used to love to hear them well,"
4396,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"If only for her sweet low tone,"
4397,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Sometimes so sad, although I knew"
4398,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,That such things never could be true.
4399,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,One day she told me such a tale
4400,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"It made me grow all cold and pale,"
4401,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,The fearful thing she told!
4402,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Of a poor woman mad and wild
4403,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Who coined the life-blood of her child,"
4404,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And tempted by a fiend, had sold"
4405,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,The heart out of her breast for gold.
4406,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"But, when she saw me frightened seem,"
4407,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"She smiled, and said it was a dream."
4408,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"When I look back and think of her,"
4409,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,My very heart-strings seem to stir;
4410,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"How kind, how fair she was, how good"
4411,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,I cannot tell you.  If I could
4412,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"You, too, would love her.  The mere thought"
4413,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Of her great love for me has brought
4414,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Tears in my eyes: though far away,"
4415,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,It seems as it were yesterday.
4416,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And just as when I look on high
4417,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Through the blue silence of the sky,"
4418,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Fresh stars shine out, and more and more,"
4419,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Where I could see so few before;
4420,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"So, the more steadily I gaze"
4421,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Upon those far-off misty days,"
4422,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Fresh words, fresh tones, fresh memories start"
4423,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Before my eyes and in my heart.
4424,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,I can remember how one day
4425,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,(Talking in silly childish way)
4426,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,I said how happy I should be
4427,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"If I were like her son--as fair,"
4428,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"With just such bright blue eyes as he,"
4429,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And such long locks of golden hair.
4430,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"A strange smile on her pale face broke,"
4431,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And in strange solemn words she spoke:
4432,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"""My own, my darling one--no, no!"
4433,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"I love you, far, far better so."
4434,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"I would not change the look you bear,"
4435,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Or one wave of your dark brown hair.
4436,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"The mere glance of your sunny eyes,"
4437,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Deep in my deepest soul I prize
4438,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Above that baby fair!
4439,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Not one of all the Earl's proud line
4440,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,In beauty ever matched with thine;
4441,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And, 'tis by thy dark locks thou art"
4442,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Bound even faster round my heart,"
4443,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And made more wholly mine!"""
4444,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And then she paused, and weeping said,"
4445,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"""You are like one who now is dead--"
4446,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Who sleeps in a far-distant grave.
4447,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Oh may God grant that you may be
4448,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"As noble and as good as he,"
4449,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"As gentle and as brave!"""
4450,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Then in my childish way I cried,"
4451,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"""The one you tell me of who died,"
4452,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Was he as noble as the Earl?"""
4453,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"I see her red lips scornful curl,"
4454,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,I feel her hold my hand again
4455,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"So tightly, that I shrink in pain--"
4456,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"I seem to hear her say,"
4457,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"""He whom I tell you of, who died,"
4458,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"He was so noble and so gay,"
4459,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"So generous and so brave,"
4460,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,That the proud Earl by his dear side
4461,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Would look a craven slave."""
4462,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"She paused; then, with a quivering sigh,"
4463,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,She laid her hand upon my brow:
4464,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"""Live like him, darling, and so die."
4465,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Remember that he tells you now,"
4466,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"True peace, real honour, and content,"
4467,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,In cheerful pious toil abide;
4468,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,That gold and splendour are but sent
4469,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"To curse our vanity and pride."""
4470,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,One day some childish fever pain
4471,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Burnt in my veins and fired my brain.
4472,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Moaning, I turned from side to side;"
4473,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And, sobbing in my bed, I cried,"
4474,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Till night in calm and darkness crept
4475,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Around me, and at last I slept."
4476,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,When suddenly I woke to see
4477,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,The Lady bending over me.
4478,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,The drops of cold November rain
4479,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Were falling from her long, damp hair;"
4480,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Her anxious eyes were dim with pain;
4481,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Yet she looked wondrous fair.
4482,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Arrayed for some great feast she came,"
4483,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,With stones that shone and burnt like flame;
4484,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Wound round her neck, like some bright snake,"
4485,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And set like stars within her hair,"
4486,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"They sparkled so, they seemed to make"
4487,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,A glory everywhere.
4488,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"I felt her tears upon my face,"
4489,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Her kisses on my eyes;
4490,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And a strange thought I could not trace
4491,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,I felt within my heart arise;
4492,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And, half in feverish pain, I said:"
4493,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"""Oh if my mother were not dead!"""
4494,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And Walter bade me sleep; but she
4495,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Said, ""Is it not the same to thee"
4496,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"That I watch by thy bed?"""
4497,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"I answered her, ""I love you, too;"
4498,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,But it can never be the same;
4499,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"She was no Countess like to you,"
4500,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Nor wore such sparkling stones of flame."""
4501,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Oh the wild look of fear and dread!
4502,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,The cry she gave of bitter woe!
4503,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,I often wonder what I said
4504,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,To make her moan and shudder so.
4505,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Through the long night she tended me
4506,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,With such sweet care and charity.
4507,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,But should weary you to tell
4508,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,All that I know and love so well:
4509,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Yet one night more stands out alone
4510,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,With a sad sweetness all its own.
4511,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,
4512,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,The wind blew loud that dreary night:
4513,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Its wailing voice I well remember:
4514,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,The stars shone out so large and bright
4515,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Upon the frosty fir-boughs white,"
4516,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,That dreary night of cold December.
4517,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"I saw old Walter silent stand,"
4518,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Watching the soft white flakes of snow
4519,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"With looks I could not understand,"
4520,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Of strange perplexity and woe.
4521,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"At last he turned and took my hand,"
4522,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And said the Countess just had sent
4523,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,To bid us come; for she would fain
4524,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"See me once more, before she went"
4525,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Away--never to come again.
4526,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,We came in silence through the wood
4527,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,(Our footfall was the only sound)
4528,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"To where the great white castle stood,"
4529,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,With darkness shadowing it around.
4530,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Breathless, we trod with cautious care"
4531,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Up the great echoing marble stair;
4532,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Trembling, by Walter's hand I held,"
4533,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Scared by the splendours I beheld:
4534,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Now thinking, ""Should the Earl appear!"""
4535,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Now looking up with giddy fear
4536,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"To the dim vaulted roof, that spread"
4537,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Its gloomy arches overhead.
4538,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Long corridors we softly past,"
4539,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,(My heart was beating loud and fast)
4540,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And reached the Lady's room at last:
4541,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,A strange faint odour seemed to weigh
4542,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Upon the dim and darkened air;
4543,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"One shaded lamp, with softened ray,"
4544,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Scarce showed the gloomy splendour there.
4545,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"The dull red brands were burning low,"
4546,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And yet a fitful gleam of light,"
4547,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Would now and then, with sudden glow,"
4548,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Start forth, then sink again in night."
4549,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"I gazed around, yet half in fear,"
4550,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Till Walter told me to draw near:
4551,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And in the strange and flickering light,"
4552,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Towards the Lady's bed I crept;
4553,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"All folded round with snowy white,"
4554,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,She lay; (one would have said she slept;)
4555,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"So still the look of that white face,"
4556,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"It seemed as it were carved in stone,"
4557,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,I paused before I dared to place
4558,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Within her cold white hand my own.
4559,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"But, with a smile of sweet surprise,"
4560,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,She turned to me her dreamy eyes;
4561,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And slowly, as if life were pain,"
4562,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,She drew me in her arms to lie:
4563,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"She strove to speak, and strove in vain;"
4564,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Each breath was like a long-drawn sigh.
4565,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"The throbs that seemed to shake her breast,"
4566,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"The trembling clasp, so loose and weak,"
4567,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"At last grew calmer, and at rest;"
4568,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And then she strove once more to speak:
4569,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"""My God, I thank thee, that my pain"
4570,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Of day by day and year by year,"
4571,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Has not been suffered all in vain,"
4572,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And I may die while he is near.
4573,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,I will not fear but that Thy grace
4574,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Has swept away my sin and woe,"
4575,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And sent this little angel face,"
4576,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"In my last hour to tell me so."""
4577,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"(And here her voice grew faint and low,)"
4578,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"""My child, where'er thy life may go,"
4579,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"To know that thou art brave and true,"
4580,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Will pierce the highest heavens through,"
4581,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And even there my soul shall be
4582,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"More joyful for this thought of thee."""
4583,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"She folded her white hands, and stayed;"
4584,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,All cold and silently she lay:
4585,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"I knelt beside the bed, and prayed"
4586,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,The prayer she used to make me say.
4587,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"I said it many times, and then"
4588,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"She did not move, but seemed to be"
4589,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"In a deep sleep, nor stirred again."
4590,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"No sound woke in the silent room,"
4591,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Or broke the dim and solemn gloom,"
4592,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Save when the brands that burnt so low,"
4593,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"With noisy fitful gleam of light,"
4594,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Would spread around a sudden glow,"
4595,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Then sink in silence and in night.
4596,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,How long I stood I do not know:
4597,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"At last poor Walter came, and said"
4598,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"(So sadly) that we now must go,"
4599,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And whispered, she we loved was dead."
4600,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"He bade me kiss her face once more,"
4601,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Then led me sobbing to the door.
4602,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"I scarcely knew what dying meant,"
4603,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Yet a strange grief, before unknown,"
4604,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Weighed on my spirit as we went
4605,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And left her lying all alone.
4606,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,
4607,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"We went to the far North once more,"
4608,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"To seek the well-remembered home,"
4609,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Where my poor kinsman dwelt before,"
4610,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Whence now he was too old to roam;
4611,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And there six happy years we past,"
4612,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Happy and peaceful till the last;
4613,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"When poor old Walter died, and he"
4614,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,Blessed me and said I now might be
4615,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,A sailor on the deep blue sea.
4616,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And so I go; and yet in spite
4617,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Of all the joys I long to know,"
4618,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Though I look onward with delight,"
4619,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,With something of regret I go;
4620,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"And young or old, on land or sea,"
4621,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,One guiding memory I shall take--
4622,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,"Of what She prayed that I might be,"
4623,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,And what I will be for her sake!
4624,VERSE: THE SAILOR BOY,

4629,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,
4630,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,

4633,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,"I wearied of this weight of years,"
4634,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,And would be free.
4635,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,
4636,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,"I tore my Sorrow from my heart,"
4637,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,I cast it far away in scorn;
4638,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,Right joyful that we two could part--
4639,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,Yet most forlorn.
4640,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,
4641,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,"I sought, (to take my Sorrow's place,)"
4642,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,Over the world for flower or gem--
4643,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,But she had had an ancient grace
4644,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,Unknown to them.
4645,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,
4646,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,I took once more with strange delight
4647,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,"My slighted Sorrow; proudly now,"
4648,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,"I wear it, set with stars of light,"
4649,VERSE: A CROWN OF SORROW,Upon my brow.

4929,VERSE: GRIEF,"Never gives my soul relief,"
4930,VERSE: GRIEF,"Never lets my sorrow cease,"
4931,VERSE: GRIEF,Never gives my spirit peace--
4932,VERSE: GRIEF,For mine enemy is Grief!
4933,VERSE: GRIEF,
4934,VERSE: GRIEF,"Pale he is, and sad and stern;"
4935,VERSE: GRIEF,"And whene'er he cometh nigh,"
4936,VERSE: GRIEF,"Blue and dim the torches burn,"
4937,VERSE: GRIEF,Pale and shrunk the roses turn;
4938,VERSE: GRIEF,While my heart that he has pierced
4939,VERSE: GRIEF,"Many a time with fiery lance,"
4940,VERSE: GRIEF,Beats and trembles at his glance:
4941,VERSE: GRIEF,"Clad in burning steel is he,"
4942,VERSE: GRIEF,All my strength he can defy;
4943,VERSE: GRIEF,For he never leaveth me--
4944,VERSE: GRIEF,And one of us must die!
4945,VERSE: GRIEF,
4946,VERSE: GRIEF,"I have said, ""Let ancient sages"
4947,VERSE: GRIEF,"Charm me from my thoughts of pain!"""
4948,VERSE: GRIEF,"So I read their deepest pages,"
4949,VERSE: GRIEF,And I strove to think--in vain!
4950,VERSE: GRIEF,"Wisdom's cold calm words I tried,"
4951,VERSE: GRIEF,But he was seated by my side:-
4952,VERSE: GRIEF,Learning I have won in vain;
4953,VERSE: GRIEF,She cannot rid me of my pain.
4954,VERSE: GRIEF,
4955,VERSE: GRIEF,"When at last soft sleep comes o'er me,"
4956,VERSE: GRIEF,A cold hand is on my heart;
4957,VERSE: GRIEF,Stern sad eyes are there before me;
4958,VERSE: GRIEF,Not in dreams will he depart:
4959,VERSE: GRIEF,And when the same dreary vision
4960,VERSE: GRIEF,"From my weary brain has fled,"
4961,VERSE: GRIEF,"Daylight brings the living phantom,"
4962,VERSE: GRIEF,"He is seated by my bed,"
4963,VERSE: GRIEF,"Bending o'er me all the while,"
4964,VERSE: GRIEF,"With his cruel, bitter smile,"

4966,VERSE: GRIEF,And either he or I must die!
4967,VERSE: GRIEF,
4968,VERSE: GRIEF,"Then I said, long time ago,"
4969,VERSE: GRIEF,"""I will flee to other climes,"
4970,VERSE: GRIEF,"I will leave mine ancient foe!"""
4971,VERSE: GRIEF,Though I wandered far and wide--
4972,VERSE: GRIEF,Still he followed at my side.
4973,VERSE: GRIEF,
4974,VERSE: GRIEF,And I fled where the blue waters
4975,VERSE: GRIEF,Bathe the sunny isles of Greece;
4976,VERSE: GRIEF,Where Thessalian mountains rise
4977,VERSE: GRIEF,Up against the purple skies;
4978,VERSE: GRIEF,Where a haunting memory liveth
4979,VERSE: GRIEF,In each wood and cave and rill;
4980,VERSE: GRIEF,But no dream of gods could help me--
4981,VERSE: GRIEF,He went with me still!
4982,VERSE: GRIEF,
4983,VERSE: GRIEF,I have been where Nile's broad river
4984,VERSE: GRIEF,Flows upon the burning sand;
4985,VERSE: GRIEF,"Where the desert monster broodeth,"
4986,VERSE: GRIEF,Where the Eastern palm-trees stand;
4987,VERSE: GRIEF,I have been where pathless forests
4988,VERSE: GRIEF,Spread a black eternal shade;
4989,VERSE: GRIEF,Where the lurking panther hiding
4990,VERSE: GRIEF,Glares from every tangled glade;
4991,VERSE: GRIEF,"But in vain I wandered wide,"
4992,VERSE: GRIEF,He was always by my side!
4993,VERSE: GRIEF,Then I fled where snows eternal
4994,VERSE: GRIEF,Cold and dreary ever lie;
4995,VERSE: GRIEF,"Where the rosy lightnings gleam,"
4996,VERSE: GRIEF,Flashing through the northern sky;
4997,VERSE: GRIEF,Where the red sun turns again
4998,VERSE: GRIEF,Back upon his path of pain;--
4999,VERSE: GRIEF,But a shadowy form was with me--
5000,VERSE: GRIEF,I had fled in vain!
5001,VERSE: GRIEF,
5002,VERSE: GRIEF,"I have thought, ""If I can gaze"
5003,VERSE: GRIEF,"Sternly on him he will fade,"
5004,VERSE: GRIEF,For I know that he is nothing
5005,VERSE: GRIEF,"But a dim ideal shade."""
5006,VERSE: GRIEF,"As I gazed at him the more,"
5007,VERSE: GRIEF,He grew stronger than before!
5008,VERSE: GRIEF,
5009,VERSE: GRIEF,"Then I said, ""Mine arm is strong,"
5010,VERSE: GRIEF,"I will make him turn and flee:"""
5011,VERSE: GRIEF,I have struggled with him long--
5012,VERSE: GRIEF,But that could never be!
5013,VERSE: GRIEF,
5014,VERSE: GRIEF,Once I battled with him so
5015,VERSE: GRIEF,That I thought I laid him low;
5016,VERSE: GRIEF,"Then in trembling joy I fled,"
5017,VERSE: GRIEF,While again and still again
5018,VERSE: GRIEF,"Murmuring to myself I said,"
5019,VERSE: GRIEF,"""Mine old enemy is dead!"""
5020,VERSE: GRIEF,"And I stood beneath the stars,"
5021,VERSE: GRIEF,"When a chill came on my frame,"
5022,VERSE: GRIEF,"And a fear I could not name,"
5023,VERSE: GRIEF,"And a sense of quick despair,"
5024,VERSE: GRIEF,"And, lo! mine enemy was there!"
5025,VERSE: GRIEF,
5026,VERSE: GRIEF,"Listen, for my soul is weary,"
5027,VERSE: GRIEF,Weary of its endless woe;
5028,VERSE: GRIEF,I have called on one to aid me
5029,VERSE: GRIEF,Mightier even than my foe.
5030,VERSE: GRIEF,Strength and hope fail day by day;
5031,VERSE: GRIEF,I shall cheat him of his prey;
5032,VERSE: GRIEF,"Some day soon, I know not when,"
5033,VERSE: GRIEF,He will stab me through and through;
5034,VERSE: GRIEF,"He has wounded me before,"
5035,VERSE: GRIEF,But my heart can bear no more;
5036,VERSE: GRIEF,"Pray that hour may come to me,"
5037,VERSE: GRIEF,Only then shall I be free;
5038,VERSE: GRIEF,Death alone has strength to take me
5039,VERSE: GRIEF,Where my foe can never be;
5040,VERSE: GRIEF,"Death, and Death alone, has power"
5041,VERSE: GRIEF,To conquer mine old enemy!

5535,II.,By the dull throbbing of my heart;
5536,II.,
5537,II.,If I should gaze and gaze in vain
5538,II.,"Into thine eyes so deep and clear,"

5541,II.,And sorrow for the vanished year;
5542,II.,
5543,II.,"If not to grieve thee overmuch,"

5546,II.,"Which thy life could not mar, or touch,"
5547,II.,And so smile down my bitter pain;
5548,II.,
5549,II.,The ghost of my dead Past would rise

6187,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,More than all his effort can express;
6188,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,And he knows the best remains unuttered;
6189,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,Sighing at what we call his success.
6190,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,
6191,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,Vainly he may strive; he dare not tell us
6192,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,All the sacred mysteries of the skies:
6193,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,Vainly he may strive; the deepest beauty
6194,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,Cannot be unveiled to mortal eyes.
6195,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,
6196,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,"And the more devoutly that he listens,"
6197,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,"And the holier message that is sent,"
6198,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,"Still the more his soul must struggle vainly,"
6199,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,Bowed beneath a noble discontent.
6200,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,
6201,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,No great Thinker ever lived and taught you
6202,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,All the wonder that his soul received;

6204,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,All the glorious vision he conceived.
6205,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,
6206,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,No Musician ever held your spirit
6207,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,"Charmed and bound in his melodious chains,"
6208,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,"But be sure he heard, and strove to render,"
6209,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,Feeble echoes of celestial strains.

6212,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,"All his dream; but the diviner part,"

6215,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,
6216,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,So with Love: for Love and Art united
6217,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,"Are twin mysteries; different, yet the same:"
6218,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,Poor indeed would be the love of any
6219,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,Who could find its full and perfect name.
6220,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,
6221,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,"Love may strive, but vain is the endeavour"
6222,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,All its boundless riches to enfold;

6224,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,Ever in its deepest depths untold.
6225,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,
6226,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,Things of Time have voices: speak and perish.
6227,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,Art and Love speak--but their words must be

6229,VERSE: UNEXPRESSED,And waves of an unfathomable sea.

6520,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,
6521,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,"Trust me, the worth of words is such"
6522,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,"They guard all noble things,"
6523,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,And that this rash irreverent touch
6524,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,Has jarred some golden strings.
6525,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,
6526,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,For what the lips have lightly said
6527,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,"The heart will lightly hold,"
6528,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,And things on which we daily tread
6529,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,Are lightly bought and sold.
6530,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,
6531,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,The sun of every day will bleach
6532,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,The costliest purple hue.
6533,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,And so our common daily speech
6534,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,Discolours what was true.
6535,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,
6536,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,But as you keep some thoughts apart
6537,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,"In sacred honoured care,"
6538,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,"If in the silence of your heart,"
6539,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,Their utterance too be rare;
6540,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,
6541,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,"Then, while a thousand words repeat"
6542,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,"Unmeaning clamours all,"
6543,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,Melodious golden echoes sweet
6544,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,Shall answer when you call.
6545,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,
6546,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,
6547,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,
6548,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,
6549,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,
6550,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,
6551,VERSE: GOLDEN WORDS,
