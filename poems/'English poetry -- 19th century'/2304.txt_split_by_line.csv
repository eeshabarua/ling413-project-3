79,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE
80,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,
81,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,
82,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The lights extinguished, by the hearth I leant,"
83,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Half weary with a listless discontent.
84,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The flickering giant-shadows, gathering near,"
85,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Closed round me with a dim and silent fear.
86,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"All dull, all dark; save when the leaping flame,"
87,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Glancing, lit up a Picture's ancient frame."
88,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Above the hearth it hung.  Perhaps the night,"
89,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"My foolish tremors, or the gleaming light,"
90,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Lent power to that Portrait dark and quaint--
91,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,A Portrait such as Rembrandt loved to paint--
92,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,The likeness of a Nun.  I seemed to trace
93,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"A world of sorrow in the patient face,"
94,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,In the thin hands folded across her breast--
95,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Its own and the room's shadow hid the rest.
96,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"I gazed and dreamed, and the dull embers stirred,"
97,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Till an old legend that I once had heard
98,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Came back to me; linked to the mystic gloom
99,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Of that dark Picture in the ghostly room.
100,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"In the far south, where clustering vines are hung;"
101,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Where first the old chivalric lays were sung,"
102,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Where earliest smiled that gracious child of France,"
103,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Angel and knight and fairy, called Romance,"
104,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,I stood one day.  The warm blue June was spread
105,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Upon the earth; blue summer overhead,"
106,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Without a cloud to fleck its radiant glare,"
107,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Without a breath to stir its sultry air.
108,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"All still, all silent, save the sobbing rush"
109,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Of rippling waves, that lapsed in silver hush"
110,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Upon the beach; where, glittering towards the strand,"
111,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,The purple Mediterranean kissed the land.
112,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,
113,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"All still, all peaceful; when a convent chime"
114,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Broke on the mid-day silence for a time,"
115,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Then trembling into quiet, seemed to cease,"
116,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,In deeper silence and more utter peace.
117,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"So as I turned to gaze, where gleaming white,"
118,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Half hid by shadowy trees from passers' sight,"
119,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The Convent lay, one who had dwelt for long"
120,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"In that fair home of ancient tale and song,"
121,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Who knew the story of each cave and hill,"
122,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And every haunting fancy lingering still
123,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Within the land, spake thus to me, and told"
124,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The Convent's treasured Legend, quaint and old:"
125,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,
126,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Long years ago, a dense and flowering wood,"
127,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Still more concealed where the white convent stood,"
128,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Borne on its perfumed wings the title came:
129,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"""Our Lady of the Hawthorns"" is its name."
130,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Then did that bell, which still rings out to-day,"
131,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Bid all the country rise, or eat, or pray."
132,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Before that convent shrine, the haughty knight"
133,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Passed the lone vigil of his perilous fight;
134,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"For humbler cottage strife or village brawl,"
135,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The Abbess listened, prayed, and settled all."
136,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Young hearts that came, weighed down by love or wrong,"
137,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Left her kind presence comforted and strong.
138,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Each passing pilgrim, and each beggar's right"
139,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Was food, and rest, and shelter for the night."
140,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"But, more than this, the Nuns could well impart"
141,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,The deepest mysteries of the healing art;
142,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Their store of herbs and simples was renowned,"
143,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And held in wondering faith for miles around.
144,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Thus strife, love, sorrow, good and evil fate,"
145,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Found help and blessing at the convent gate.
146,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,
147,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Of all the nuns, no heart was half so light,"
148,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"No eyelids veiling glances half as bright,"
149,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"No step that glided with such noiseless feet,"
150,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"No face that looked so tender or so sweet,"
151,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"No voice that rose in choir so pure, so clear,"
152,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"No heart to all the others half so dear,"
153,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"So surely touched by others' pain or woe,"
154,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"(Guessing the grief her young life could not know,)"
155,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"No soul in childlike faith so undefiled,"
156,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"As Sister Angela's, the ""Convent Child."""
157,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,For thus they loved to call her.  She had known
158,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"No home, no love, no kindred, save their own."
159,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"An orphan, to their tender nursing given,"
160,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Child, plaything, pupil, now the Bride of Heaven."
161,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And she it was who trimmed the lamp's red light
162,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"That swung before the altar, day and night;"
163,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Her hands it was whose patient skill could trace
164,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The finest broidery, weave the costliest lace;"
165,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"But most of all, her first and dearest care,"
166,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The office she would never miss or share,"
167,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Was every day to weave fresh garlands sweet,"
168,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,To place before the shrine at Mary's feet.
169,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Nature is bounteous in that region fair,"
170,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,For even winter has her blossoms there.
171,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Thus Angela loved to count each feast the best,"
172,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,By telling with what flowers the shrine was dressed.
173,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"In pomp supreme the countless Roses passed,"
174,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Battalion on battalion thronging fast,"
175,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Each with a different banner, flaming bright,"
176,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Damask, or striped, or crimson, pink, or white,"
177,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Until they bowed before a newborn queen,"
178,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And the pure virgin Lily rose serene.
179,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Though Angela always thought the Mother blest
180,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Must love the time of her own hawthorn best,"
181,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Each evening through the year, with equal, care,"
182,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"She placed her flowers; then kneeling down in prayer,"
183,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"As their faint perfume rose before the shrine,"
184,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"So rose her thoughts, as pure and as divine."
185,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"She knelt until the shades grew dim without,"
186,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Till one by one the altar lights shone out,"
187,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Till one by one the Nuns, like shadows dim,"
188,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Gathered around to chant their vesper hymn;
189,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Her voice then led the music's winged flight,"
190,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And ""Ave, Maris Stella"" filled the night."
191,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,But wherefore linger on those days of peace?
192,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"When storms draw near, then quiet hours must cease."
193,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"War, cruel war, defaced the land, and came"
194,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"So near the convent with its breath of flame,"
195,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"That, seeking shelter, frightened peasants fled,"
196,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Sobbing out tales of coming fear and dread,"
197,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Till after a fierce skirmish, down the road,"
198,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"One night came straggling soldiers, with their load"
199,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Of wounded, dying comrades; and the band,"
200,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Half pleading yet as if they could command,"
201,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Summoned the trembling Sisters, craved their care,"
202,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Then rode away, and left the wounded there."
203,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,But soon compassion bade all fear depart.
204,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And bidding every Sister do her part,"
205,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Some prepare simples, healing salves, or bands,"
206,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The Abbess chose the more experienced hands,"
207,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,To dress the wounds needing most skilful care;
208,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Yet even the youngest Novice took her share.
209,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"To Angela, who had but ready will"
210,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And tender pity, yet no special skill,"
211,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Was given the charge of a young foreign knight,"
212,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Whose wounds were painful, but whose danger slight."
213,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Day after day she watched beside his bed,"
214,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And first in hushed repose the hours fled:
215,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"His feverish moans alone the silence stirred,"
216,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Or her soft voice, uttering some pious word."
217,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,At last the fever left him; day by day
218,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The hours, no longer silent, passed away."
219,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"What could she speak of?  First, to still his plaints,"
220,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,She told him legends of the martyred Saints;
221,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Described the pangs, which, through God's plenteous grace,"
222,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Had gained their souls so high and bright a place.
223,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,This pious artifice soon found success--
224,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Or so she fancied--for he murmured less.
225,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"So she described the glorious pomp sublime,"
226,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"In which the chapel shone at Easter time,"
227,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The Banners, Vestments, gold, and colours bright,"
228,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Counted how many tapers gave their light;
229,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Then, in minute detail went on to say,"
230,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,How the High Altar looked on Christmas-day:
231,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The kings and shepherds, all in green and red,"
232,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And a bright star of jewels overhead.
233,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Then told the sign by which they all had seen,"
234,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"How even nature loved to greet her Queen,"
235,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"For, when Our Lady's last procession went"
236,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Down the long garden, every head was bent,"
237,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And, rosary in hand, each Sister prayed;"
238,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"As the long floating banners were displayed,"
239,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"They struck the hawthorn boughs, and showers and showers"
240,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Of buds and blossoms strewed her way with flowers.
241,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The Knight unwearied listened; till at last,"
242,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,He too described the glories of his past;
243,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Tourney, and joust, and pageant bright and fair,"
244,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And all the lovely ladies who were there.
245,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,But half incredulous she heard.  Could this--
246,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,This be the world? this place of love and bliss!
247,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Where then was hid the strange and hideous charm,"
248,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,That never failed to bring the gazer harm?
249,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"She crossed herself, yet asked, and listened still,"
250,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And still the knight described with all his skill
251,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The glorious world of joy, all joys above,"
252,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Transfigured in the golden mist of love.
253,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Spread, spread your wings, ye angel guardians bright,"
254,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And shield these dazzling phantoms from her sight!
255,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"But no; days passed, matins and vespers rang,"
256,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And still the quiet Nuns toiled, prayed, and sang,"
257,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And never guessed the fatal, coiling net"
258,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Which every day drew near, and nearer yet,"
259,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Around their darling; for she went and came
260,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"About her duties, outwardly the same."
261,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The same? ah, no! even when she knelt to pray,"
262,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Some charmed dream kept all her heart away.
263,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"So days went on, until the convent gate"
264,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Opened one night.  Who durst go forth so late?
265,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Across the moonlit grass, with stealthy tread,"
266,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Two silent, shrouded figures passed and fled."
267,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And all was silent, save the moaning seas,"
268,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"That sobbed and pleaded, and a wailing breeze"
269,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,That sighed among the perfumed hawthorn trees.
270,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,
271,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"What need to tell that dream so bright and brief,"
272,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Of joy unchequered by a dread of grief?
273,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"What need to tell how all such dreams must fade,"
274,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Before the slow, foreboding, dreaded shade,"
275,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"That floated nearer, until pomp and pride,"
276,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Pleasure and wealth, were summoned to her side."
277,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"To bid, at least, the noisy hours forget,"
278,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And clamour down the whispers of regret.
279,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Still Angela strove to dream, and strove in vain;"
280,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Awakened once, she could not sleep again."
281,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"She saw, each day and hour, more worthless grown"
282,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,The heart for which she cast away her own;
283,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And her soul learnt, through bitterest inward strife,"
284,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The slight, frail love for which she wrecked her life,"
285,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The phantom for which all her hope was given,"
286,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,The cold bleak earth for which she bartered heaven!
287,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,But all in vain; would even the tenderest heart
288,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Now stoop to take so poor an outcast's part?
289,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,
290,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Years fled, and she grew reckless more and more,"
291,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Until the humblest peasant closed his door,"
292,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And where she passed, fair dames, in scorn and pride,"
293,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Shuddered, and drew their rustling robes aside."
294,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"At last a yearning seemed to fill her soul,"
295,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,A longing that was stronger than control:
296,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Once more, just once again, to see the place"
297,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,That knew her young and innocent; to retrace
298,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,The long and weary southern path; to gaze
299,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Upon the haven of her childish days;
300,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Once more beneath the convent roof to lie;
301,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Once more to look upon her home--and die!
302,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Weary and worn--her comrades, chill remorse"
303,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And black despair, yet a strange silent force"
304,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Within her heart, that drew her more and more--"
305,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Onward she crawled, and begged from door to door."
306,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Weighed down with weary days, her failing strength"
307,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Grew less each hour, till one day's dawn at length,"
308,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"As first its rays flooded the world with light,"
309,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Showed the broad waters, glittering blue and bright,"
310,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And where, amid the leafy hawthorn wood,"
311,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Just as of old the quiet cloister stood.
312,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Would any know her?  Nay, no fear.  Her face"
313,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Had lost all trace of youth, of joy, of grace,"
314,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Of the pure happy soul they used to know--
315,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,The novice Angela--so long ago.
316,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,She rang the convent bell.  The well-known sound
317,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Smote on her heart, and bowed her to the ground,"
318,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And she, who had not wept for long dry years,"
319,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Felt the strange rush of unaccustomed tears;
320,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Terror and anguish seemed to check her breath,"
321,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And stop her heart.  Oh God! could this be death?
322,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Crouching against the iron gate, she laid"
323,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Her weary head against the bars, and prayed:"
324,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"But nearer footsteps drew, then seemed to wait:"
325,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And then she heard the opening of the grate,"
326,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And saw the withered face, on which awoke"
327,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Pity and sorrow, as the portress spoke,"
328,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And asked the stranger's bidding: ""Take me in,"""
329,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"She faltered, ""Sister Monica, from sin,"
330,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And sorrow, and despair, that will not cease;"
331,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Oh, take me in, and let me die in peace!"""
332,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"With soothing words the Sister bade her wait,"
333,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Until she brought the key to unbar the gate.
334,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The beggar tried to thank her as she lay,"
335,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And heard the echoing footsteps die away.
336,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"But what soft voice was that which sounded near,"
337,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And stirred strange trouble in her heart to hear?
338,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,She raised her head; she saw--she seemed to know--
339,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"A face that came from long, long years ago:"
340,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Herself; yet not as when she fled away,"
341,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The young and blooming novice, fair and gay,"
342,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"But a grave woman, gentle and serene:"
343,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,The outcast knew it--what she might have been.
344,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"But, as she gazed and gazed, a radiance bright"
345,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Filled all the place with strange and sudden light;
346,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The Nun was there no longer, but instead,"
347,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"A figure with a circle round its head,"
348,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"A ring of glory; and a face, so meek,"
349,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"So soft, so tender . . . Angela strove to speak,"
350,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And stretched her hands out, crying, ""Mary mild,"
351,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Mother of mercy, help me!--help your child!"""
352,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And Mary answered, ""From thy bitter past,"
353,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Welcome, my child! oh, welcome home at last!"
354,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"I filled thy place.  Thy flight is known to none,"
355,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,For all thy daily duties I have done;
356,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Gathered thy flowers, and prayed, and sung, and slept;"
357,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Didst thou not know, poor child, thy place was kept?"
358,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Kind hearts are here; yet would the tenderest one
359,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Have limits to its mercy: God has none.
360,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And man's forgiveness may be true and sweet,"
361,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,But yet he stoops to give it.  More complete
362,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Is Love that lays forgiveness at thy feet,"
363,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And pleads with thee to raise it.  Only Heaven
364,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Means crowned, not vanquished, when it says 'Forgiven!'"""
365,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Back hurried Sister Monica; but where
366,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Was the poor beggar she left lying there?
367,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Gone; and she searched in vain, and sought the place"
368,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,For that wan woman with the piteous face:
369,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"But only Angela at the gateway stood,"
370,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Laden with hawthorn blossoms from the wood.
371,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And never did a day pass by again,"
372,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"But the old portress, with a sigh of pain,"
373,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Would sorrow for her loitering: with a prayer
374,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"That the poor beggar, in her wild despair,"
375,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Might not have come to any ill; and when
376,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"She ended, ""God forgive her!"" humbly then"
377,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Did Angela bow her head, and say ""Amen!"""
378,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,How pitiful her heart was! all could trace
379,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Something that dimmed the brightness of her face
380,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"After that day, which none had seen before;"
381,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Not trouble--but a shadow--nothing more.
382,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,
383,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Years passed away.  Then, one dark day of dread"
384,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Saw all the sisters kneeling round a bed,"
385,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Where Angela lay dying; every breath
386,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Struggling beneath the heavy hand of death.
387,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"But suddenly a flush lit up her cheek,"
388,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"She raised her wan right hand, and strove to speak."
389,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,In sorrowing love they listened; not a sound
390,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Or sigh disturbed the utter silence round.
391,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The very tapers' flames were scarcely stirred,"
392,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,In such hushed awe the sisters knelt and heard.
393,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And through that silence Angela told her life:
394,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Her sin, her flight; the sorrow and the strife,"
395,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And the return; and then clear, low and calm,"
396,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"""Praise God for me, my sisters;"" and the psalm"
397,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Rang up to heaven, far and clear and wide,"
398,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Again and yet again, then sank and died;"
399,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"While her white face had such a smile of peace,"
400,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,They saw she never heard the music cease;
401,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And weeping sisters laid her in her tomb,"
402,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Crowned with a wreath of perfumed hawthorn bloom.
403,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,
404,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And thus the Legend ended.  It may be
405,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Something is hidden in the mystery,"
406,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Besides the lesson of God's pardon shown,"
407,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Never enough believed, or asked, or known."
408,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Have we not all, amid life's petty strife,"
409,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,Some pure ideal of a noble life
410,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,That once seemed possible?  Did we not hear
411,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The flutter of its wings, and feel it near,"
412,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And just within our reach?  It was.  And yet
413,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"We lost it in this daily jar and fret,"
414,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And now live idle in a vague regret.
415,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"But still our place is kept, and it will wait,"
416,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Ready for us to fill it, soon or late:"
417,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"No star is ever lost we once have seen,"
418,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,We always may be what we might have been.
419,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"Since Good, though only thought, has life and breath,"
420,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,God's life--can always be redeemed from death;
421,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"And evil, in its nature, is decay,"
422,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,And any hour can blot it all away;
423,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"The hopes that lost in some far distance seem,"
424,VERSE: A LEGEND OF PROVENCE,"May be the truer life, and this the dream."

433,VERSE: ENVY,Shone bright in his face.
434,VERSE: ENVY,I fought for years; with no effort
435,VERSE: ENVY,He conquered the place:
436,VERSE: ENVY,"We ran; my feet were all bleeding,"
437,VERSE: ENVY,But he won the race.
438,VERSE: ENVY,
439,VERSE: ENVY,Spite of his many successes
440,VERSE: ENVY,Men loved him the same;
441,VERSE: ENVY,My one pale ray of good fortune
442,VERSE: ENVY,Met scoffing and blame.
443,VERSE: ENVY,"When we erred, they gave him pity,"
444,VERSE: ENVY,But me--only shame.
445,VERSE: ENVY,
446,VERSE: ENVY,"My home was still in the shadow,"
447,VERSE: ENVY,His lay in the sun:
448,VERSE: ENVY,I longed in vain: what he asked for
449,VERSE: ENVY,It straightway was done.
450,VERSE: ENVY,"Once I staked all my heart's treasure,"
451,VERSE: ENVY,We played--and he won.
452,VERSE: ENVY,
453,VERSE: ENVY,"Yes; and just now I have seen him,"
454,VERSE: ENVY,"Cold, smiling, and blest,"
455,VERSE: ENVY,Laid in his coffin.  God help me!
456,VERSE: ENVY,"While he is at rest,"
457,VERSE: ENVY,I am cursed still to live:- even
458,VERSE: ENVY,Death loved him the best.

487,VERSE: OVER THE MOUNTAIN,"My heart and soul to fill,"
488,VERSE: OVER THE MOUNTAIN,"A painful, strange desire"
489,VERSE: OVER THE MOUNTAIN,"To break some weary bond,"

775,VERSE: A LOST CHORD,"Which came from the soul of the Organ,"
776,VERSE: A LOST CHORD,And entered into mine.

789,VERSE: TOO LATE,Hush! speak low; tread softly;
790,VERSE: TOO LATE,Draw the sheet aside;--
791,VERSE: TOO LATE,"Yes, she does look peaceful;"
792,VERSE: TOO LATE,With that smile she died.
793,VERSE: TOO LATE,
794,VERSE: TOO LATE,Yet stern want and sorrow
795,VERSE: TOO LATE,Even now you trace
796,VERSE: TOO LATE,"On the wan, worn features"
797,VERSE: TOO LATE,Of the still white face.
798,VERSE: TOO LATE,
799,VERSE: TOO LATE,"Restless, helpless, hopeless,"
800,VERSE: TOO LATE,Was her bitter part;--
801,VERSE: TOO LATE,Now--how still the Violets
802,VERSE: TOO LATE,Lie upon her Heart!
803,VERSE: TOO LATE,
804,VERSE: TOO LATE,She who toiled and laboured
805,VERSE: TOO LATE,For her daily bread;
806,VERSE: TOO LATE,See the velvet hangings
807,VERSE: TOO LATE,Of this stately bed.
808,VERSE: TOO LATE,
809,VERSE: TOO LATE,"Yes, they did forgive her;"
810,VERSE: TOO LATE,Brought her home at last;
811,VERSE: TOO LATE,Strove to cover over
812,VERSE: TOO LATE,Their relentless past.
813,VERSE: TOO LATE,
814,VERSE: TOO LATE,"Ah, they would have given"
815,VERSE: TOO LATE,"Wealth, and home, and pride,"
816,VERSE: TOO LATE,To see her just look happy
817,VERSE: TOO LATE,Once before she died!
818,VERSE: TOO LATE,

823,VERSE: TOO LATE,

826,VERSE: TOO LATE,Was beyond them: healing
827,VERSE: TOO LATE,Came to-day--in vain!
828,VERSE: TOO LATE,
829,VERSE: TOO LATE,If she had but lingered
830,VERSE: TOO LATE,Just a few hours more;
831,VERSE: TOO LATE,Or had this letter reached her
832,VERSE: TOO LATE,Just one day before!
833,VERSE: TOO LATE,
834,VERSE: TOO LATE,I can almost pity
835,VERSE: TOO LATE,Even him to-day;
836,VERSE: TOO LATE,Though he let this anguish
837,VERSE: TOO LATE,Eat her heart away.
838,VERSE: TOO LATE,
839,VERSE: TOO LATE,Yet she never blamed him:-
840,VERSE: TOO LATE,One day you shall know
841,VERSE: TOO LATE,How this sorrow happened;
842,VERSE: TOO LATE,It was long ago.
843,VERSE: TOO LATE,
844,VERSE: TOO LATE,I have read the letter:
845,VERSE: TOO LATE,"Many a weary year,"
846,VERSE: TOO LATE,For one word she hungered--
847,VERSE: TOO LATE,There are thousands here.
848,VERSE: TOO LATE,
849,VERSE: TOO LATE,"If she could but hear it,"
850,VERSE: TOO LATE,Could but understand;
851,VERSE: TOO LATE,See--I put the letter
852,VERSE: TOO LATE,In her cold white hand.
853,VERSE: TOO LATE,
854,VERSE: TOO LATE,"Even these words, so longed for,"
855,VERSE: TOO LATE,Do not stir her rest;
856,VERSE: TOO LATE,"Well--I should not murmur,"
857,VERSE: TOO LATE,For God judges best.
858,VERSE: TOO LATE,
859,VERSE: TOO LATE,"She needs no more pity,--"
860,VERSE: TOO LATE,"But I mourn his fate,"
861,VERSE: TOO LATE,When he hears his letter
862,VERSE: TOO LATE,Came a day too late.

876,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,
877,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,The moon was hidden;

879,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,So she could not shelter
880,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,"In heaven that night,"
881,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,For the Angels' ladders

883,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,

904,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,
905,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,"The worker toiled on,"
906,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,For his time was brief;

908,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,Her own pale grief:
909,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,They heard not the promise
910,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,That brought relief.
911,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,
912,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,But fiercer the Tempest
913,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,"Rose than before,"
914,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,When the Angel paused
915,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,"At a humble door,"
916,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,And asked for shelter

918,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,
919,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,"A weary woman,"

921,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,With the brand upon her

924,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,And took her in.
925,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,
926,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,"Took her in gently,"
927,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,And did her best
928,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,To dry her pinions;
929,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,And made her rest
930,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,With tender pity
931,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,Upon her breast.
932,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,
933,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,When the eastern morning
934,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,"Grew bright and red,"
935,VERSE: THE REQUITAL,Up the first sunbeam

1126,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,I it was who guided her weak hand
1127,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"For a blessing on each little head,"
1128,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Laid her baby by her on the bed,"
1129,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Heard the words they could not understand.
1130,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1131,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"And I drew them round my knee that night,"

1136,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1137,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"I, who guessed what her last dread had been,"

1142,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1143,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,And I knew so much! for I had lived
1144,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,With my lady since her childhood: known
1145,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"What her young and happy days had been,"
1146,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,And the grief no other eyes had seen
1147,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,I had watched and sorrowed for alone.
1148,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1149,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Ah! she once had such a happy smile!
1150,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,I had known how sorely she was tried:
1151,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Six short years before, her eyes were bright"
1152,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"As her little blue-eyed May's that night,"
1153,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,When she stood by her dead mother's side.
1154,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1155,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,No--I will not say he was unkind;
1156,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,But she had been used to love and praise.
1157,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"He was somewhat grave--perhaps, in truth,"
1158,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Could not weave her joyous, smiling youth,"
1159,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Into all his stern and serious ways.
1160,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1161,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"She, who should have reigned a blooming flower,"
1162,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"First in pride and honour, as in grace,--"
1163,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"She, whose will had once ruled all around,"
1164,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Queen and darling of us all--she found
1165,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Change indeed in that cold, stately place."
1166,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1167,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Yet she would not blame him, even to me,"
1168,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Though she often sat and wept alone;
1169,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"But she could not hide it near her death,"
1170,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"When she said with her last struggling breath,"
1171,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"""Let my babies still remain my own!"""
1172,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1173,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"I it was who drew the sheet aside,"
1174,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,When he saw his dead wife's face.  That test
1175,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Seemed to strike right to his heart.  He said,"
1176,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"In a strange, low whisper, to the dead,"
1177,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"""God knows, love, I did it for the best!"""
1178,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1179,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"And he wept--Oh yes, I will be just--"
1180,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,When I brought the children to him there--
1181,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Wondering sorrow in their baby eyes;
1182,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"And he soothed them with his fond replies,"
1183,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Bidding me give double love and care.
1184,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1185,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Ah, I loved them well for her dear sake:"
1186,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Little Arthur, with his serious air;"
1187,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"May, with all her mother's pretty ways,"
1188,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Blushing, and at any word of praise"
1189,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Shaking out her sunny golden hair.
1190,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1191,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,And the little one of all--poor child!
1192,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,She had cost that dear and precious life.
1193,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Once Sir Arthur spoke my lady's name,"
1194,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"When the baby's gloomy christening came,"
1195,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"And he called her ""Olga--like my wife!"""
1196,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1197,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Save that time, he never spoke of her;"
1198,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"He grew graver, sterner, every day;"
1199,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"And the children felt it, for they dropped"
1200,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Low their voices, and their laughter stopped"
1201,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,While he stood and watched them at their play.
1202,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1203,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"No, he never named their mother's name."
1204,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,But I told them of her: told them all
1205,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"She had been; so gentle, good, and bright;"
1206,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,And I always took them every night
1207,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Where her picture hung in the great hall.
1208,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1209,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"There she stood: white daisies in her hand,"
1210,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,And her red lips parted as to speak
1211,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,With a smile; the blue and sunny air
1212,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Seemed to stir her floating golden hair,"
1213,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,And to bring a faint blush on her cheek.
1214,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1215,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Well, so time passed on; a year was gone,"
1216,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,And Sir Arthur had been much away.
1217,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Then the news came!  I shed many tears
1218,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,When I saw the truth of all my fears
1219,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Rise before me on that bitter day.
1220,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1221,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Any one but her I could have borne!
1222,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,But my lady loved her as her friend.
1223,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Through their childhood and their early youth,"
1224,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,How she used to count upon the truth
1225,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Of this friendship that would never end!
1226,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1227,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Older, graver than my lady was,"
1228,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Whose young, gentle heart on her relied,"
1229,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"She would give advice, and praise, and blame,"
1230,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"And my lady leant on Margaret's name,"
1231,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"As her dearest comfort, help, and guide."
1232,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1233,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"I had never liked her, and I think"
1234,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"That my lady grew to doubt her too,"
1235,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Since her marriage; for she named her less,"
1236,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Never saw her, and I used to guess"
1237,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,At some secret wrong I never knew.
1238,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1239,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"That might be or not.  But now, to hear"
1240,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"She would come and reign here in her stead,"
1241,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,With the pomp and splendour of a bride:
1242,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Would no thought reproach her in her pride
1243,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,With the silent memory of the dead?
1244,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1245,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"So, the day came, and the bells rang out,"
1246,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,And I laid the children's black aside;
1247,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"And I held each little trembling hand,"
1248,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,As I strove to make them understand
1249,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,They must greet their father's new-made bride.
1250,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1251,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Ah, Sir Arthur might look grave and stern,"
1252,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"And his lady's eyes might well grow dim,"
1253,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"When the children shrank in fear away,--"
1254,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Little Arthur hid his face, and May"
1255,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Would not raise her eyes, or speak to him."
1256,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1257,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"When Sir Arthur bade them greet their ""mother,"""
1258,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"I was forced to chide, yet proud to hear"
1259,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"How my little loving May replied,"
1260,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"With her mother's pretty air of pride,--"
1261,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"""Our dear mother has been dead a year!"""
1262,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1263,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Ah, the lady's tears might well fall fast,"
1264,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"As she kissed them, and then turned away."
1265,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"She might strive to smile or to forget,"
1266,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,But I think some shadow of regret
1267,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Must have risen to blight her wedding-day.
1268,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1269,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,She had some strange touch of self-reproach;
1270,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"For she used to linger day by day,"
1271,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"By the nursery door, or garden gate,"
1272,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"With a sad, calm, wistful look, and wait"
1273,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Watching the three children at their play.
1274,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1275,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,But they always shrank away from her
1276,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"When she strove to comfort their alarms,"
1277,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"And their grave, cold silence to beguile:"
1278,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Even little Olga's baby-smile
1279,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Quivered into tears when in her arms.
1280,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1281,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,I could never chide them: for I saw
1282,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,How their mother's memory grew more deep
1283,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,In their hearts.  Each night I had to tell
1284,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Stories of her whom I loved so well
1285,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"When a child, to send them off to sleep."
1286,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1287,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"But Sir Arthur--Oh, this was too hard!--"
1288,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"He, who had been always stern and sad"
1289,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"In my lady's time, seemed to rejoice"
1290,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Each day more; and I could hear his voice
1291,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Even, sounding younger and more glad."
1292,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1293,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"He might perhaps have blamed them, but his wife"
1294,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Never failed to take the children's part:
1295,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"She would stay him with her pleading tone,"
1296,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Saying she would strive, and strive alone,"
1297,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Till she gained each little wayward heart.
1298,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1299,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"And she strove indeed, and seemed to be"
1300,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Always waiting for their love, in vain;"
1301,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Yet, when May had most her mother's look,"
1302,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Then the lady's calm, cold accents shook"
1303,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,With some memory of reproachful pain.
1304,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1305,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Little May would never call her Mother:
1306,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"So, one day, the lady, bending low,"
1307,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Kissed her golden curls, and softly said,"
1308,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"""Sweet one, call me Margaret, instead,--"
1309,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Your dear mother used to call me so."""
1310,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1311,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"She was gentle, kind, and patient too,"
1312,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Yet in vain: the children held apart.
1313,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Ah, their mother's gentle memory dwelt"
1314,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Near them, and her little orphans felt"
1315,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,She had the first claim upon their heart.
1316,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1317,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,So three years passed; then the war broke out;
1318,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,And a rumour seemed to spread and rise;
1319,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"First we guessed what sorrow must befall,"
1320,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Then all doubt fled, for we read it all"
1321,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,In the depths of her despairing eyes.
1322,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1323,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Yes; Sir Arthur had been called away
1324,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"To that scene of slaughter, fear, and strife,--"
1325,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Now he seemed to know with double pain,"
1326,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"The cold, bitter gulf that must remain"
1327,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,To divide his children from his wife.
1328,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1329,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Nearer came the day he was to sail,"
1330,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Deeper grew the coming woe and fear,"
1331,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"When, one night, the children at my knee"
1332,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Knelt to say their evening prayer to me,"
1333,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,I looked up and saw Sir Arthur near.
1334,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1335,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"There they knelt with folded hands, and said"
1336,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Low, soft words in stammering accents sweet;"
1337,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,In the firelight shone their golden hair
1338,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"And white robes: my darlings looked so fair,"
1339,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,With their little bare and rosy feet!
1340,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1341,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"There he waited till their low ""Amen;"""
1342,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Stopped the rosy lips raised for ""Good night!""--"
1343,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Drew them with a fond clasp, close and near,"
1344,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"As he bade them stay with him, and hear"
1345,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Something that would make his heart more light.
1346,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1347,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Little Olga crept into his arms;
1348,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Arthur leant upon his shoulder; May
1349,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Knelt beside him, with her earnest eyes"
1350,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Lifted up in patient, calm surprise--"
1351,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,I can almost hear his words to-day.
1352,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1353,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"""Years ago, my children, years ago,"
1354,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"When your mother was a child, she came"
1355,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"From her northern home, and here she met"
1356,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Love for love, and comfort for regret,"
1357,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"In one early friend,--you know her name."
1358,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1359,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"""And this friend--a few years older--gave"
1360,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Such fond care, such love, that day by day"
1361,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"The new home grew happy, joy complete,"
1362,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Studies easier, and play more sweet,"
1363,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,While all childish sorrows passed away.
1364,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1365,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"""And your mother--fragile, like my May--"
1366,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Leant on this deep love,--nor leant in vain."
1367,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"For this friend (strong, generous, noble heart!)"
1368,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Gave the sweet, and took the bitter part,--"
1369,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Brought her all the joy, and kept the pain."
1370,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1371,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"""Years passed on, and then I saw them first:"
1372,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"It was hard to say which was most fair,"
1373,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Your sweet mother's bright and blushing face,"
1374,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Or the graver Margaret's stately grace;
1375,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Golden locks, or braided raven hair."
1376,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1377,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"""Then it happened, by a strange, sad fate,"
1378,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,One thought entered into each young soul:
1379,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Joy for one--if for the other pain;
1380,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Loss for one--if for the other gain:
1381,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"One must lose, and one possess the whole."
1382,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1383,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"""And so this--this--what they cared for--came"
1384,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,And belonged to Margaret: was her own.
1385,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"But she laid the gift aside, to take"
1386,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Pain and sorrow for your mother's sake,"
1387,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,And none knew it but herself alone.
1388,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1389,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"""Then she travelled far away, and none"
1390,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,The strange mystery of her absence knew.
1391,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Margaret's secret thought was never told:
1392,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Even your mother thought her changed and cold,"
1393,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,And for many years I thought so too.
1394,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1395,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"""She was gone; and then your mother took"
1396,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,That poor gift which Margaret laid aside:
1397,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Flower, or toy, or trinket, matters not:"
1398,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,What it was had better be forgot . . .
1399,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,It was just then she became my bride.
1400,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1401,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"""Now, I think May knows the hope I have."
1402,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Arthur, darling, can you guess the rest?"
1403,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Even my little Olga understands
1404,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Great gifts can be given by little hands,"
1405,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Since of all gifts Love is still the best.
1406,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1407,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"""Margaret is my dear and honoured wife,"
1408,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,And I hold her so.  But she can claim
1409,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"From your hearts, dear ones, a loving debt"
1410,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"I can neither pay, nor yet forget:"
1411,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,You can give it in your mother's name.
1412,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1413,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"""Earth spoils even Love, and here a shade"
1414,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"On the purest, noblest heart may fall:"
1415,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Now your mother dwells in perfect light,"
1416,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"She will bless us, I believe, to-night,--"
1417,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"She is happy now, and she knows all."""
1418,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1419,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Next day was farewell--a day of tears;
1420,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Yet Sir Arthur, as he rode away,"
1421,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,And turned back to see his lady stand
1422,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"With the children clinging to her hand,"
1423,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Looked as if it were a happy day.
1424,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,
1425,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"Ah, they loved her soon!  The little one"
1426,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Crept into her arms as to a nest;
1427,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Arthur always with her now; and May
1428,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,Growing nearer to her every day:--
1429,VERSE: A NEW MOTHER,"--Well, I loved my own dear lady best."

1486,VERSE: MY WILL,"Through a strange and sacred radiance,"
1487,VERSE: MY WILL,"By Love's Charter, wholly mine;"
1488,VERSE: MY WILL,She will never lend to others
1489,VERSE: MY WILL,"Slenderest link of thought I claim,"
1490,VERSE: MY WILL,"I will, therefore, to her keeping"
1491,VERSE: MY WILL,Leave my memory and my name.
1492,VERSE: MY WILL,
1493,VERSE: MY WILL,Bertha will do truer service
1494,VERSE: MY WILL,"To her kind than I have done,"
1495,VERSE: MY WILL,So I leave to her young spirit
1496,VERSE: MY WILL,The long Work I have begun.
1497,VERSE: MY WILL,"Well! the threads are tangled, broken,"
1498,VERSE: MY WILL,"And the colours do not blend,"
1499,VERSE: MY WILL,She will bend her earnest striving
1500,VERSE: MY WILL,Both to finish and amend:
1501,VERSE: MY WILL,"And, when it is all completed,"
1502,VERSE: MY WILL,"Strong with care and rich with skill,"
1503,VERSE: MY WILL,"Just because my hands began it,"
1504,VERSE: MY WILL,She will love it better still.
1505,VERSE: MY WILL,
1506,VERSE: MY WILL,"Ruth shall have my dearest token,"

1513,VERSE: MY WILL,As she knows--these many years.
1514,VERSE: MY WILL,"Sometimes hopeless, faint, and weary"
1515,VERSE: MY WILL,Yet a blessing shall remain
1516,VERSE: MY WILL,"With the task, and Ruth will prize it"
1517,VERSE: MY WILL,For my many hours of pain.
1518,VERSE: MY WILL,
1519,VERSE: MY WILL,"What must I leave you, my Alice?"
1520,VERSE: MY WILL,"Nothing, Love, to do or bear,"
1521,VERSE: MY WILL,Nothing that can dim your blue eyes
1522,VERSE: MY WILL,With the slightest cloud of care.
1523,VERSE: MY WILL,"I will leave my heart to love you,"

1527,VERSE: MY WILL,"No one else, my child, can claim it;"
1528,VERSE: MY WILL,"Though you find old scars of pain,"

1531,VERSE: MY WILL,
1532,VERSE: MY WILL,Are my gifts indeed so worthless
1533,VERSE: MY WILL,Now the slender sum is told?

2040,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,To her whom my soul loved best;
2041,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,But I had my task to finish.
2042,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,And she was gone home to rest.
2043,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,
2044,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,To rest in the far bright heaven:
2045,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,"Oh, so far away from here,"

2047,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,For I knew she could not hear!
2048,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,
2049,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,I had a message to send her.
2050,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,"So tender, and true, and sweet,"
2051,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,"I longed for an Angel to bear it,"
2052,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,And lay it down at her feet.
2053,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,
2054,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,"I placed it, one summer evening,"
2055,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,On a Cloudlet's fleecy breast;
2056,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,"But it faded in golden splendour,"
2057,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,And died in the crimson west.
2058,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,
2059,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,"I gave it the Lark next morning,"
2060,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,And I watched it soar and soar;
2061,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,"But its pinions grew faint and weary,"
2062,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,And it fluttered to earth once more.
2063,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,
2064,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,To the heart of a Rose I told it;
2065,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,"And the perfume, sweet and rare,"
2066,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,"Growing faint on the blue bright ether,"
2067,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,Was lost in the balmy air.
2068,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,
2069,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,"I laid it upon a Censer,"
2070,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,And I saw the incense rise;
2071,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,But its clouds of rolling silver
2072,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,Could not reach the far blue skies.
2073,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,
2074,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,"I cried, in my passionate longing:-"

2079,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,"Then I heard a strain of music,"
2080,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,"So mighty, so pure, so clear,"

2087,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,"And carry my thought to her."""
2088,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,
2089,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,It rose in harmonious rushing
2090,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,Of mingled voices and strings.
2091,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,And I tenderly laid my message
2092,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,On the Music's outspread wings.
2093,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,
2094,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,"I heard it float farther and farther,"
2095,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,In sound more perfect than speech;

2097,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,Farther than soul can reach.
2098,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,
2099,VERSE: SENT TO HEAVEN,And I know that at last my message

2151,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,Blue against the bluer Heavens
2152,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,"Stood the mountain, calm and still,"
2153,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,"Two white Angels, bending earthward,"
2154,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,Leant upon the hill.
2155,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,
2156,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,"Listening leant those silent Angels,"
2157,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,And I also longed to hear
2158,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,What sweet strain of earthly music
2159,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,Thus could charm their ear.
2160,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,
2161,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,I heard the sound of many trumpets
2162,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,In a warlike march draw nigh;
2163,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,Solemnly a mighty army
2164,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,Passed in order by.
2165,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,
2166,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,But the clang had ceased; the echoes
2167,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,Soon had faded from the hill;
2168,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,"While the Angels, calm and earnest,"
2169,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,Leant and listened still.
2170,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,
2171,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,"Then I heard a fainter clamour,"
2172,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,Forge and wheel were clashing near
2173,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,And the Reapers in the meadow
2174,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,Singing loud and clear.
2175,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,
2176,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,"When the sunset came in glory,"

2181,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,"Then, as daylight slowly vanished,"
2182,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,"And the evening mists grew dim,"
2183,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,Solemnly from distant voices
2184,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,Rose a vesper hymn.
2185,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,
2186,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,"When the chant was done, and lingering"
2187,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,"Died upon the evening air,"
2188,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,From the hill the radiant Angels
2189,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,Still were listening there.
2190,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,
2191,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,"Silent came the gathering darkness,"
2192,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,Bringing with it sleep and rest;
2193,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,Save a little bird was singing
2194,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,Near her leafy nest.
2195,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,
2196,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,Through the sounds of war and labour
2197,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,"She had warbled all day long,"
2198,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,While the Angels leant and listened
2199,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,Only to her song.
2200,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,
2201,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,But the starry night was coming;
2202,VERSE: LISTENING ANGELS,When she ceased her little lay

2256,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Stir not in that quiet hour: through the valley, calm and stilly,"
2257,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,All in hushed and loving silence watch the slow departing Day.
2258,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2259,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Till the last faint western cloudlet, faint and rosy, ceases blushing,"

2263,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2264,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Such, of all day's changing hours, is the fittest and the meetest"
2265,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,For a farewell hour--and parting looks less bitter and more blest;
2266,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Earth seems like a shrine for sorrow, Nature's mother voice is sweetest,"
2267,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,And her hand seems laid in chiding on the unquiet throbbing breast.
2268,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2269,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Words are lower, for the twilight seems rebuking sad repining,"
2270,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"And wild murmur and rebellion, as all childish and in vain;"

2278,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2279,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Should have been: her dreams of childhood, never straying, never faltering,"
2280,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Still had needed Philip's image to make future life complete;
2281,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Philip's young hopes of ambition, ever changing, ever altering,"
2282,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Needed Mildred's gentle presence even to make successes sweet.
2283,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2284,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,This day should have seen their marriage; the calm crowning and assurance
2285,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Of two hearts, fulfilling rather, and not changing, either life:"

2289,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"But her gentle spirit long had learnt, unquestioning, submitting,"
2290,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"To revere his youthful longings, and to marvel at the fate"
2291,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"That gave such a humble office, all unworthy and unfitting,"
2292,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"To the genius of the village, who was born for something great."
2293,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2294,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"When the learned Traveller came there who had gained renown at college,"
2295,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Whose abstruse research had won him even European fame,"
2296,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Questioned Philip, praised his genius, marvelled at his self-taught knowledge,"
2297,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Could she murmur if he called him up to London and to fame?
2298,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2299,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Could she waver when he bade her take the burden of decision,"
2300,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Since his troth to her was plighted, and his life was now her own?"
2301,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Could she doom him to inaction? could she, when a newborn vision"

2304,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"So her little trembling fingers, that had toiled with such fond pleasure,"
2305,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Paused, and laid aside, and folded the unfinished wedding gown;"
2306,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Faltering earnestly assurance, that she too could, in her measure,"

2308,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2309,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Now they pace the shady lime-walk, now the last words must be spoken,"
2310,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Words of trust, for neither dreaded more than waiting and delay;"
2311,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Was not love still called eternal--could a plighted vow be broken?--
2312,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,See the crimson light of sunset fades in purple mist away.
2313,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2314,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"""Yes, my Mildred,"" Philip told her, ""one calm thought of joy and blessing,"

2323,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2324,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"""Take it, dear; this little circlet is the first link, strong and holy,"

2326,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Till the day when you may wear it as my wife--my own--mine wholly--

2331,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Dreams of work, and fame, and honour struggling with a tender pity,"
2332,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Till the loving Past receding saw the conquering Future rise.
2333,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2334,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Daybreak still found Mildred watching, with the wonder of first sorrow,"
2335,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,How the outward world unaltered shone the same this very day;
2336,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"How unpitying and relentless busy life met this new morrow,"
2337,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Earth, and sky, and man unheeding that her joy had passed away."
2338,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2339,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Then the round of weary duties, cold and formal, came to meet her,"
2340,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,With the life within departed that had given them each a soul;
2341,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,And her sick heart even slighted gentle words that came to greet her;
2342,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"For Grief spread its shadowy pinions, like a blight, upon the whole."
2343,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2344,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Jar one chord, the harp is silent; move one stone, the arch is shattered;"

2346,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"One dark cloud can hide the sunlight; loose one string, the pearls are"
2347,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,scattered;

2349,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2350,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Life went on, the two lives running side by side; the outward seeming,"
2351,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,And the truer and diviner hidden in the heart and brain;
2352,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Dreams grow holy, put in action; work grows fair through starry dreaming;"
2353,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"But where each flows on unmingling, both are fruitless and in vain."
2354,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2355,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Such was Mildred's life; her dreaming lay in some far-distant region,"
2356,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"All the fairer, all the brighter, that its glories were but guessed;"
2357,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"And the daily round of duties seemed an unreal, airy legion--"
2358,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Nothing true save Philip's letters and the ring upon her breast.
2359,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2360,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Letters telling how he struggled, for some plan or vision aiming,"
2361,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,And at last how he just grasped it as a fresh one spread its wings;
2362,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"How the honour or the learning, once the climax, now were claiming,"
2363,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Only more and more, becoming merely steps to higher things."
2364,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2365,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Telling her of foreign countries: little store had she of learning,"
2366,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"So her earnest, simple spirit answered as he touched the string;"
2367,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Day by day, to these bright fancies all her silent thoughts were turning,"
2368,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Seeing every radiant picture framed within her golden Ring.
2369,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2370,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Oh, poor heart--love, if thou willest; but, thine own soul still possessing,"
2371,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Live thy life: not a reflection or a shadow of his own:
2372,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Lean as fondly, as completely, as thou willest--but confessing"
2373,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"That thy strength is God's, and therefore can, if need be, stand alone."
2374,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2375,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Little means were there around her to make farther, wider ranges,"
2376,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Where her loving gentle spirit could try any stronger flight;
2377,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"And she turned aside, half fearing that fresh thoughts were fickle changes--"
2378,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,That she must stay as he left her on that farewell summer night.
2379,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2380,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Love should still be guide and leader, like a herald should have risen,"
2381,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Lighting up the long dark vistas, conquering all opposing fates;"
2382,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"But new claims, new thoughts, new duties found her heart a silent prison,"
2383,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"And found Love, with folded pinions, like a jailer by the gates."
2384,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2385,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Yet why blame her? it had needed greater strength than she was given
2386,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,To have gone against the current that so calmly flowed along;
2387,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Nothing fresh came near the village save the rain and dew of heaven,"
2388,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"And her nature was too passive, and her love perhaps too strong."
2389,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2390,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"The great world of thought, that rushes down the years, and onward sweeping"
2391,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Bears upon its mighty billows in its progress each and all,"
2392,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Flowed so far away, its murmur did not rouse them from their sleeping;"
2393,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Life and Time and Truth were speaking, but they did not hear their call."
2394,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2395,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Years flowed on; and every morning heard her prayer grow lower, deeper,"
2396,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"As she called all blessings on him, and bade every ill depart,"
2397,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"And each night when the cold moonlight shone upon that quiet sleeper,"
2398,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,It would show her ring that glittered with each throbbing of her heart.
2399,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2400,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Years passed on.  Fame came for Philip in a full, o'erflowing measure;"
2401,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"He was spoken of and honoured through the breadth of many lands,"
2402,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"And he wrote it all to Mildred, as if praise were only pleasure,"
2403,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"As if fame were only honour, when he laid them in her hands."
2404,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2405,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Mildred heard it without wonder, as a sure result expected,"
2406,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"For how could it fail, since merit and renown go side by side:"
2407,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"And the neighbours who first fancied genius ought to be suspected,"
2408,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Might at last give up their caution, and could own him now with pride."
2409,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2410,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Years flowed on.  These empty honours led to others they called better,"
2411,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"He had saved some slender fortune, and might claim his bride at last:"
2412,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Mildred, grown so used to waiting, felt half startled by the letter"
2413,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"That now made her future certain, and would consecrate her past."
2414,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2415,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"And he came: grown sterner, older--changed indeed: a grave reliance"
2416,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Had replaced his eager manner, and the quick short speech of old:"
2417,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,He had gone forth with a spirit half of hope and half defiance;
2418,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,He returned with proud assurance half disdainful and half cold.
2419,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2420,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Yet his old self seemed returning while he stood sometimes, and listened"
2421,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"To her calm soft voice, relating all the thoughts of these long years;"
2422,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"And if Mildred's heart was heavy, and at times her blue eyes glistened,"
2423,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Still in thought she would not whisper aught of sorrow or of fears.
2424,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2425,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Autumn with its golden corn-fields, autumn with its storms and showers,"
2426,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Had been there to greet his coming with its forests gold and brown;
2427,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"And the last leaves still were falling, fading still the year's last"
2428,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"flowers,"
2429,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"When he left the quiet village, and took back his bride to town."
2430,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2431,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Home--the home that she had pictured many a time in twilight, dwelling"
2432,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"On that tender gentle fancy, folded round with loving care;"
2433,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Here was home--the end, the haven; and what spirit voice seemed telling,"
2434,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"That she only held the casket, with the gem no longer there?"
2435,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2436,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Sad it may be to be longing, with a patience faint and weary,"
2437,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,For a hope deferred--and sadder still to see it fade and fall;
2438,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Yet to grasp the thing we long for, and, with sorrow sick and dreary,"
2439,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Then to find how it can fail us, is the saddest pain of all."
2440,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2441,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"What was wanting?  He was gentle, kind, and generous still, deferring"
2442,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,To her wishes always; nothing seemed to mar their tranquil life:
2443,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"There are skies so calm and leaden that we long for storm-winds stirring,"
2444,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"There is peace so cold and bitter, that we almost welcome strife."
2445,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2446,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Darker grew the clouds above her, and the slow conviction clearer,"
2447,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"That he gave her home and pity, but that heart, and soul, and mind"
2448,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Were beyond her now; he loved her, and in youth he had been near her,"
2449,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"But he now had gone far onward, and had left her there behind."
2450,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2451,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Yes, beyond her: yes, quick-hearted, her Love helped her in revealing"
2452,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"It was worthless, while so mighty; was too weak, although so strong;"
2453,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,There were courts she could not enter; depths she could not sound; yet
2454,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,feeling
2455,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"It was vain to strive or struggle, vainer still to mourn or long."
2456,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2457,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"He would give her words of kindness, he would talk of home, but seeming"
2458,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"With an absent look, forgetting if he held or dropped her hand;"
2459,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"And then turn with eager pleasure to his writing, reading, dreaming,"
2460,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Or to speak of things with others that she could not understand.
2461,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2462,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"He had paid, and paid most nobly, all he owed; no need of blaming;"
2463,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"It had cost him something, may be, that no future could restore:"
2464,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"In her heart of hearts she knew it; Love and Sorrow, not complaining,"
2465,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Only suffered all the deeper, only loved him all the more."
2466,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2467,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Sometimes then a stronger anguish, and more cruel, weighed upon her,"
2468,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"That through all those years of waiting, he had slowly learnt the truth;"
2469,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"He had known himself mistaken, but that, bound to her in honour,"
2470,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"He renounced his life, to pay her for the patience of her youth."
2471,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2472,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"But a star was slowly rising from that mist of grief, and brighter"
2473,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Grew her eyes, for each slow hour surer comfort seemed to bring;"
2474,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"And she watched with strange sad smiling, how her trembling hands grew slighter,"
2475,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"And how thin her slender finger, and how large her wedding-ring."
2476,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2477,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"And the tears dropped slowly on it, as she kissed that golden token"
2478,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"With a deeper love, it may be, than was in the far-off past;"
2479,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"And remembering Philip's fancy, that so long ago was spoken,"
2480,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Thought her Ring's bright angel guardian had stayed near her to the last.
2481,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2482,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Grieving sorely, grieving truly, with a tender care and sorrow,"
2483,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Philip watched the slow, sure fading of his gentle, patient wife;"
2484,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Could he guess with what a yearning she was longing for the morrow,"
2485,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Could he guess the bitter knowledge that had wearied her of life?
2486,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2487,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Now with violets strewn upon her, Mildred lies in peaceful sleeping;"
2488,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"All unbound her long, bright tresses, and her throbbing heart at rest,"
2489,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"And the cold, blue rays of moonlight, through the open casement creeping,"
2490,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,"Show the ring upon her finger, and her hands crossed on her breast."
2491,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,
2492,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Peace at last.  Of peace eternal is her calm sweet smile a token.
2493,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Has some angel lingering near her let a radiant promise fall?
2494,VERSE: PHILIP AND MILDRED,Has he told her Heaven unites again the links that Earth has broken?

2725,VERSE: A CHANGELING,
2726,VERSE: A CHANGELING,
2727,VERSE: A CHANGELING,A little changeling spirit
2728,VERSE: A CHANGELING,Crept to my arms one day:
2729,VERSE: A CHANGELING,I had no heart or courage
2730,VERSE: A CHANGELING,To drive the child away.
2731,VERSE: A CHANGELING,
2732,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"So all day long I soothed her,"
2733,VERSE: A CHANGELING,And hushed her on my breast;
2734,VERSE: A CHANGELING,And all night long her wailing
2735,VERSE: A CHANGELING,Would never let me rest.
2736,VERSE: A CHANGELING,
2737,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"I dug a grave to hold her,"
2738,VERSE: A CHANGELING,A grave both dark and deep;
2739,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"I covered her with violets,"
2740,VERSE: A CHANGELING,And laid her there to sleep.
2741,VERSE: A CHANGELING,
2742,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"I used to go and watch there,"
2743,VERSE: A CHANGELING,Both night and morning too:-
2744,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"It was my tears, I fancy,"
2745,VERSE: A CHANGELING,That kept the violets blue.
2746,VERSE: A CHANGELING,
2747,VERSE: A CHANGELING,I took her up: and once more
2748,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"I felt the clinging hold,"
2749,VERSE: A CHANGELING,And heard the ceaseless wailing
2750,VERSE: A CHANGELING,That wearied me of old.
2751,VERSE: A CHANGELING,
2752,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"I wandered, and I wandered,"
2753,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"With my burden on my breast,"
2754,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"Till I saw a church-door open,"
2755,VERSE: A CHANGELING,And entered in to rest.
2756,VERSE: A CHANGELING,
2757,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"In the dim, dying daylight,"
2758,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"Set in a flowery shrine,"
2759,VERSE: A CHANGELING,I saw the Virgin Mother
2760,VERSE: A CHANGELING,Holding her Child divine.
2761,VERSE: A CHANGELING,
2762,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"I knelt down there in silence,"
2763,VERSE: A CHANGELING,And on the Altar-stone
2764,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"I laid my wailing burden,"
2765,VERSE: A CHANGELING,And came away--alone.
2766,VERSE: A CHANGELING,
2767,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"And now that little spirit,"
2768,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"That sobbed so all day long,"
2769,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"Is grown a shining Angel,"
2770,VERSE: A CHANGELING,With wines both wide and strong.
2771,VERSE: A CHANGELING,
2772,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"She watches me from Heaven,"
2773,VERSE: A CHANGELING,"With loving, tender care,"
2774,VERSE: A CHANGELING,And one day she has promised
2775,VERSE: A CHANGELING,That I shall find her there.

2782,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,
2783,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,Where the little babbling streamlet
2784,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"First springs forth to light,"
2785,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Trickling through soft velvet mosses,"
2786,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,Almost hid from sight;
2787,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Vowed I with delight,--"
2788,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"""River, I will follow thee,"
2789,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Through thy wanderings to the Sea!"""
2790,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,
2791,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Gleaming 'mid the purple heather,"
2792,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Downward then it sped,"
2793,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Glancing through the mountain gorges,"
2794,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Like a silver thread,"
2795,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"As it quicker fled,"
2796,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Louder music in its flow,"
2797,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,Dashing to the Vale below.
2798,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,
2799,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Then its voice grew lower, gentler,"
2800,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"And its pace less fleet,"
2801,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,Just as though it loved to linger
2802,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Round the rushes' feet,"
2803,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,As they stooped to meet
2804,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Their clear images below,"
2805,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,Broken by the ripples' flow.
2806,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,
2807,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,Purple Willow-herb bent over
2808,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,To her shadow fair;
2809,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Meadow-sweet, in feathery clusters,"
2810,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,Perfumed all the air;
2811,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Silver-weed was there,"
2812,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"And in one calm, grassy spot,"
2813,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Starry, blue Forget-me-not."
2814,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,
2815,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Tangled weeds, below the waters,"
2816,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,Still seemed drawn away;
2817,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Yet the current, floating onward,"
2818,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,Was less strong than they;--
2819,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Sunbeams watched their play,"
2820,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"With a flickering light and shade,"
2821,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,Through the screen the Alders made.
2822,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,
2823,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,Broader grew the flowing River;
2824,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,To its grassy brink
2825,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Slowly, in the slanting sun-rays,"
2826,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,Cattle trooped to drink:
2827,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"The blue sky, I think,"
2828,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Was no bluer than that stream,"
2829,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Slipping onward, like a dream."
2830,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,
2831,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Quicker, deeper then it hurried,"
2832,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,Rushing fierce and free;
2833,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"But I said, ""It should grow calmer"
2834,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Ere it meets the Sea,"
2835,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"The wide purple Sea,"
2836,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Which I weary for in vain,"
2837,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Wasting all my toil and pain."""
2838,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,
2839,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"But it rushed still quicker, fiercer,"
2840,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"In its rocky bed,"
2841,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,Hard and stony was the pathway
2842,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,To my tired tread;
2843,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"""I despair,"" I said,"
2844,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"""Of that wide and glorious Sea"
2845,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"That was promised unto me."""
2846,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,
2847,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"So I turned aside, and wandered"
2848,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Through green meadows near,"
2849,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Far away, among the daisies,"
2850,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Far away, for fear"
2851,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,Lest I still should hear
2852,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"The loud murmur of its song,"
2853,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,As the River flowed along.
2854,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,
2855,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,Now I hear it not:- I loiter
2856,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,Gaily as before;
2857,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Yet I sometimes think,--and thinking"
2858,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Makes my heart so sore,--"
2859,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"Just a few steps more,"
2860,VERSE: DISCOURAGED,"And there might have shone for me,"

3429,III.,"If he--her all--her Brother,"

3433,III.,
3434,IV.,IV.
3435,IV.,
3436,IV.,It is not one week's anguish

3438,IV.,"Joy has not died here lately,"
3439,IV.,Struck down by one quick blow;
3440,IV.,But cruel months have needed
3441,IV.,"Their long relentless chain,"

3444,IV.,
3445,V.,V.

3451,V.,"When Herbert--who, unconscious,"

3453,V.,"Bade her, in pride and pleasure,"

3455,V.,
3456,VI.,VI.
3457,VI.,
3458,VI.,"Bade her rejoice, and smiling,"

3461,VI.,The care she gave to him.
3462,VI.,This fresh bright life would bring her
3463,VI.,A new and joyous fate--
3464,VI.,"Oh, Alice, check the murmur"

3473,VII.,She might--Oh sad repining!
3474,VII.,"What ""might have been,"" forget;"
3475,VII.,"""It was not,"" should suffice us"

3477,VII.,
3478,VIII.,VIII.
3479,VIII.,
3480,VIII.,"He needed her no longer,"
3481,VIII.,Each day it grew more plain;

3483,VIII.,Then with a wondering pain.
3484,VIII.,"Love: why, his wife best gave it;"
3485,VIII.,"Comfort: durst Alice speak,"

3491,IX.,No more long talks by firelight

3509,X.,A burden to his wife.
3510,X.,

3514,XI.,"Feared, dreaded, knew at length"
3515,XI.,How much his nature owed her
3516,XI.,"Of truth, and power, and strength;"
3517,XI.,And watched the daily failing
3518,XI.,Of all his nobler part:
3519,XI.,"Low aims, weak purpose, telling"
3520,XI.,"In lower, weaker art."
3521,XI.,
3522,XII.,XII.
3523,XII.,
3524,XII.,"And now, when he is dying,"

3527,XII.,The bride of one short year.
3528,XII.,The last care is another's;
3529,XII.,The last prayer must not be

3531,XII.,Beside their mother's knee.
3532,XII.,
3533,XIII.,XIII.
3534,XIII.,
3535,XIII.,Summoned at last: she kisses
3536,XIII.,The clay-cold stiffening hand;
3537,XIII.,"And, reading pleading efforts"
3538,XIII.,"To make her understand,"
3539,XIII.,"Answers, with solemn promise,"
3540,XIII.,"In clear but trembling tone,"
3541,XIII.,To Dora's life henceforward

3549,XIV.,Into a sobbing sleep.
3550,XIV.,The poor weak child will need her: . . .
3551,XIV.,"Oh, who can dare complain,"

4055,FOUNDED ON AN OLD FRENCH LEGEND,"""I am not cold or thankless,"

4068,FOUNDED ON AN OLD FRENCH LEGEND,
4069,FOUNDED ON AN OLD FRENCH LEGEND,"""The evening of my bridal"
4070,FOUNDED ON AN OLD FRENCH LEGEND,Death took my Life away;
4071,FOUNDED ON AN OLD FRENCH LEGEND,Not all Love's passionate pleading

4157,VERSE: A CONTRAST,"But leave it, dear, with the ring,"
4158,VERSE: A CONTRAST,And give me the little Portrait
4159,VERSE: A CONTRAST,Which hangs by a crimson string.
4160,VERSE: A CONTRAST,
4161,VERSE: A CONTRAST,I have never opened that Casket
4162,VERSE: A CONTRAST,"Since, many long years ago,"
4163,VERSE: A CONTRAST,It was sent me back in anger
4164,VERSE: A CONTRAST,By one whom I used to know.

4166,VERSE: A CONTRAST,But I want you to see the Portrait:
4167,VERSE: A CONTRAST,I wonder if you can trace
4168,VERSE: A CONTRAST,A look of that smiling creature
4169,VERSE: A CONTRAST,Left now in my faded face.
4170,VERSE: A CONTRAST,
4171,VERSE: A CONTRAST,It was like me once; but remember
4172,VERSE: A CONTRAST,"The weary relentless years,"
4173,VERSE: A CONTRAST,"And Life, with its fierce, brief Tempests,"

4180,VERSE: A CONTRAST,
4181,VERSE: A CONTRAST,"With restless, yet confident longing"
4182,VERSE: A CONTRAST,How those blue eyes seem to gaze
4183,VERSE: A CONTRAST,"Into deep and exhaustless Treasures,"
4184,VERSE: A CONTRAST,All hid in the coming days.
4185,VERSE: A CONTRAST,
4186,VERSE: A CONTRAST,"With that trust which leans on the Future,"
4187,VERSE: A CONTRAST,"And counts on her promised store,"
4188,VERSE: A CONTRAST,Until she has taught us to tremble

4201,VERSE: A CONTRAST,It is strange; but Life's currents drift us
4202,VERSE: A CONTRAST,"So surely and swiftly on,"

4206,VERSE: A CONTRAST,"And forget, while to-day absorbs us,"
4207,VERSE: A CONTRAST,How old mysteries are unsealed;
4208,VERSE: A CONTRAST,"How the old, old ties are loosened,"
4209,VERSE: A CONTRAST,"And the old, old wounds are healed."
4210,VERSE: A CONTRAST,
4211,VERSE: A CONTRAST,And we say that our Life is fleeting
4212,VERSE: A CONTRAST,Like a story that Time has told;
4213,VERSE: A CONTRAST,But we fancy that we--we only
4214,VERSE: A CONTRAST,Are just what we were of old.
4215,VERSE: A CONTRAST,
4216,VERSE: A CONTRAST,So now and then it is wisdom
4217,VERSE: A CONTRAST,"To gaze, as I do to-day,"
4218,VERSE: A CONTRAST,At a half-forgotten relic

4226,VERSE: A CONTRAST,If they only stirred in my spirit
4227,VERSE: A CONTRAST,"Forgotten pleasure and pain,--"

4493,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,Echoes repeating my song.
4494,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,
4495,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,And I sang till it grew immortal;
4496,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,"For that very song of mine,"
4497,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,"When re-echoed behind the Portal,"
4498,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,Was filled with a life divine.
4499,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,

4501,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,"Of arches, whose magical art"

4506,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,"Which, as air breathed over its strings,"

4515,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,Long I trembled and paused--then parted

4523,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,For I know what the echoes say.
4524,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,
4525,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,"Yet I sing not the song of old,"
4526,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,"Ere I knew whence the echo came,"
4527,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,Ere I opened the door of gold;
4528,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,But the music sounds just the same.
4529,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,
4530,VERSE: THE INNER CHAMBER,"Then take warning, and turn away"

4542,I.,
4543,I.,"A trinket made like a Heart, dear,"
4544,I.,"Of red gold, bright and fine,"
4545,I.,"Was given to me for a keepsake,"
4546,I.,Given to me for mine.
4547,I.,
4548,I.,"And another heart, warm and tender,"
4549,I.,As true as a heart could be;
4550,I.,And every throb that stirred it
4551,I.,Was always and all for me.
4552,I.,
4553,I.,"Sailing over the waters,"
4554,I.,"Watching the far blue land,"
4555,I.,"I dropped my golden heart, dear,"
4556,I.,Dropped it out of my hand!
4557,I.,
4558,I.,"It lies in the cold blue waters,"
4559,I.,"Fathoms and fathoms deep,"
4560,I.,"The golden heart which I promised,"
4561,I.,Promised to prize and keep.
4562,I.,
4563,I.,"Gazing at Life's bright visions,"
4564,I.,"So false, and fair, and new,"
4565,I.,"I forgot the other heart, dear,"
4566,I.,Forgot it and lost it too!
4567,I.,
4568,I.,"I might seek that heart for ever,"
4569,I.,I might seek and seek in vain;--
4570,I.,"And for one short, careless hour,"
4571,I.,I pay with a life of pain.
4572,I.,
4573,II.,II.
4574,II.,
4575,II.,The Heart?--Yes I wore it
4576,II.,As sign and as token
4577,II.,"Of a love that once gave it,"
4578,II.,A vow that was spoken;
4579,II.,"But a love, and a vow, and a heart"
4580,II.,Can be broken.
4581,II.,
4582,II.,The Love?--Life and Death
4583,II.,"Are crushed into a day,"
4584,II.,So what wonder that Love
4585,II.,Should as soon pass away--
4586,II.,What wonder I saw it
4587,II.,"Fade, fail, and decay."
4588,II.,
4589,II.,"The Vow?--why what was it,"
4590,II.,It snapped like a thread:
4591,II.,Who cares for the corpse
4592,II.,When the spirit is fled?
4593,II.,"Then I said, ""Let the Dead rise"

4595,II.,
4596,II.,"""While the true, living future"

4608,III.,"Heart and tress, as mine,"
4609,III.,Like the Love which gave the token
4610,III.,See to-day the Heart is broken!
4611,III.,
4612,III.,"Broken is the golden heart,"
4613,III.,Lost the tress of hair;
4614,III.,"Ah, the shrine is empty, vacant,"
4615,III.,"Desolate, and bare!"
4616,III.,"So the token should depart,"
4617,III.,When Love dies within the heart.
4618,III.,
4619,III.,"Fast and deep the river floweth,"
4620,III.,Floweth to the west;
4621,III.,I will cast the golden trinket
