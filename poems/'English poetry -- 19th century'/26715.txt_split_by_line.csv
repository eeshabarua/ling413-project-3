656,INTRODUCTION,
657,INTRODUCTION,
658,INTRODUCTION,"_No species of poetry is more ancient than the lyrical, and yet none"
659,INTRODUCTION,shows so little sign of having outlived the requirements of human
660,INTRODUCTION,"passion. The world may grow tired of epics and of tragedies, but each"
661,INTRODUCTION,"generation, as it sees the hawthorns blossom and the freshness of"
662,INTRODUCTION,"girlhood expand, is seized with a pang which nothing but the spasm of"
663,INTRODUCTION,verse will relieve. Each youth imagines that spring-tide and love are
664,INTRODUCTION,"wonders which he is the first of human beings to appreciate, and he"
665,INTRODUCTION,"burns to alleviate his emotion in rhyme. Historians exaggerate, perhaps,"
666,INTRODUCTION,the function of music in awakening and guiding the exercise of lyrical
667,INTRODUCTION,"poetry. The lyric exists, they tell us, as an accompaniment to the lyre;"
668,INTRODUCTION,and without the mechanical harmony the spoken song is an artifice. Quite
669,INTRODUCTION,as plausibly might it be avowed that music was but added to verse to
670,INTRODUCTION,"concentrate and emphasize its rapture, to add poignancy and volume to"
671,INTRODUCTION,"its expression. But the truth is that these two arts, though sometimes"
672,INTRODUCTION,"happily allied, are, and always have been, independent. When verse has"
673,INTRODUCTION,"been innocent enough to lean on music, we may be likely to find that"
674,INTRODUCTION,"music also has been of the simplest order, and that the pair of them,"
675,INTRODUCTION,"like two delicious children, have tottered and swayed together down the"
676,INTRODUCTION,"flowery meadows of experience. When either poetry or music is adult, the"
677,INTRODUCTION,"presence of each is a distraction to the other, and each prefers, in the"
678,INTRODUCTION,"elaborate ages, to stand alone, since the mystery of the one confounds"
679,INTRODUCTION,the complexity of the other. Most poets hate music; few musicians
680,INTRODUCTION,comprehend the nature of poetry; and the combination of these arts has
681,INTRODUCTION,"probably, in all ages, been contrived, not for the satisfaction of"
682,INTRODUCTION,"artists, but for the convenience of their public._"
683,INTRODUCTION,
684,INTRODUCTION,_This divorce between poetry and music has been more frankly accepted in
685,INTRODUCTION,"the present century than ever before, and is nowadays scarcely opposed"
686,INTRODUCTION,in serious criticism. If music were a necessary ornament of lyrical
687,INTRODUCTION,"verse, the latter would nowadays scarcely exist; but we hear less and"
688,INTRODUCTION,less of the poets devotion (save in a purely conventional sense) to the
689,INTRODUCTION,lute and the pipe. What we call the Victorian lyric is absolutely
690,INTRODUCTION,independent of any such aid. It may be that certain songs of Tennyson
691,INTRODUCTION,"and Christina Rossetti have been with great popularity ""set,"" as it is"
692,INTRODUCTION,"called, ""to music."" So far as the latter is in itself successful, it"
693,INTRODUCTION,stultifies the former; and we admit at last that the idea of one art
694,INTRODUCTION,aiding another in this combination is absolutely fictitious. The
695,INTRODUCTION,beauty--even the beauty of sound--conveyed by the ear in such lyrics as
696,INTRODUCTION,"""Break, break, break,"" or ""When I am dead, my dearest,"" is obscured, is"
697,INTRODUCTION,"exchanged for another and a rival species of beauty, by the most"
698,INTRODUCTION,exquisite musical setting that a composer can invent._
699,INTRODUCTION,
700,INTRODUCTION,"_The age which has been the first to accept this condition, then, should"
701,INTRODUCTION,be rich in frankly lyrical poetry; and this we find to be the case with
702,INTRODUCTION,the Victorian period. At no time has a greater mass of this species of
703,INTRODUCTION,"verse been produced, not even in the combined Elizabethan and Jacobean"
704,INTRODUCTION,age. But when we come to consider the quality of this later harvest of
705,INTRODUCTION,"song, we observe in it a far less homogeneous character. We can take a"
706,INTRODUCTION,"piece of verse, and decide at sight that it must be Elizabethan, or of"
707,INTRODUCTION,"the age of the Pléiade in France, or of a particular period in Italy."
708,INTRODUCTION,Even an ode of our own eighteenth century is hardly to be confounded
709,INTRODUCTION,with a fragment from any other school. The great Georgian age introduced
710,INTRODUCTION,a wide variety into English poetry; and yet we have but to examine the
711,INTRODUCTION,selected jewels strung into so exquisite a carcanet by Mr. Palgrave in
712,INTRODUCTION,"his ""Golden Treasury"" to notice with surprise how close a family"
713,INTRODUCTION,"likeness exists between the contributions of Shelley, Wordsworth, Keats,"
714,INTRODUCTION,"and Byron. The distinctions of style, of course, are very great; but the"
715,INTRODUCTION,"general character of the diction, the imagery, even of the rhythm, is"
716,INTRODUCTION,"more or less identical. The stamp of the same age is upon them,--they"
717,INTRODUCTION,are hall-marked 1820._
718,INTRODUCTION,
719,INTRODUCTION,_It is perhaps too early to decide that this will never be the case with
720,INTRODUCTION,the Victorian lyrics. While we live in an age we see the distinction of
721,INTRODUCTION,"its parts, rather than their co-relation. It is said that the Japanese"
722,INTRODUCTION,Government once sent over a Commission to report upon the art of Europe;
723,INTRODUCTION,"and that, having visited the exhibitions of London, Paris, Florence, and"
724,INTRODUCTION,"Berlin, the Commissioners confessed that the works of the European"
725,INTRODUCTION,painters all looked so exactly alike that it was difficult to
726,INTRODUCTION,"distinguish one from another. The Japanese eye, trained in absolutely"
727,INTRODUCTION,"opposed conventions, could not tell the difference between a Watts and a"
728,INTRODUCTION,"Fortuny, a Théodore Rousseau and a Henry Moore. So it is quite possible,"
729,INTRODUCTION,"it is even probable, that future critics may see a close similarity"
730,INTRODUCTION,where we see nothing but divergence between the various productions of
731,INTRODUCTION,the Victorian age. Yet we can judge but what we discern; and certainly
732,INTRODUCTION,"to the critical eye to-day it is the absence of a central tendency, the"
733,INTRODUCTION,"chaotic cultivation of all contrivable varieties of style, which most"
734,INTRODUCTION,strikingly seems to distinguish the times we live in._
735,INTRODUCTION,
736,INTRODUCTION,"_We use the word ""Victorian"" in literature to distinguish what was"
737,INTRODUCTION,"written after the decline of that age of which Walter Scott, Coleridge,"
738,INTRODUCTION,"and Wordsworth were the survivors. It is well to recollect, however,"
739,INTRODUCTION,"that Tennyson, who is the Victorian writer_ par excellence, _had"
740,INTRODUCTION,published the most individual and characteristic of his lyrics long
741,INTRODUCTION,"before the Queen ascended the throne, and that Elizabeth Barrett, Henry"
742,INTRODUCTION,"Taylor, William Barnes, and others were by this date of mature age. It"
743,INTRODUCTION,"is difficult to remind ourselves, who have lived in the radiance of that"
744,INTRODUCTION,"august figure, that some of the most beautiful of Tennyson's lyrics,"
745,INTRODUCTION,"such as ""Mariana"" and ""The Dying Swan"" are now separated from us by as"
746,INTRODUCTION,long a period of years as divided them from Dr. Johnson and the author
747,INTRODUCTION,"of ""Night Thoughts."" The reflection is of value only as warning us of"
748,INTRODUCTION,"the extraordinary length of the epoch we still call ""Victorian."" It"
749,INTRODUCTION,"covers, not a mere generation, but much more than half a century. During"
750,INTRODUCTION,this length of time a complete revolution in literary taste might have
751,INTRODUCTION,"been expected to take place. This has not occurred, and the cause may"
752,INTRODUCTION,very well be the extreme license permitted to the poets to adopt
753,INTRODUCTION,"whatever style they pleased. Where all the doors stand wide open, there"
754,INTRODUCTION,"is no object in escaping; where there is but one door, and that one"
755,INTRODUCTION,"barred, it is human nature to fret for some violent means of evasion."
756,INTRODUCTION,How divine have been the methods of the Victorian lyrists may easily be
757,INTRODUCTION,exemplified_:--
758,INTRODUCTION,
759,INTRODUCTION,"_""Quoth tongue of neither maid nor wife"
760,INTRODUCTION,"To heart of neither wife nor maid,"
761,INTRODUCTION,Lead we not here a jolly life
762,INTRODUCTION,Betwixt the shine and shade?_
763,INTRODUCTION,
764,INTRODUCTION,"_""Quoth heart of neither maid nor wife"
765,INTRODUCTION,"To tongue of neither wife nor maid,"
766,INTRODUCTION,"Thou wagg'st, but I am worn with strife,"
767,INTRODUCTION,"And feel like flowers that fade.""_"
768,INTRODUCTION,
769,INTRODUCTION,"_That is a masterpiece, but so is this:--_"
770,INTRODUCTION,
771,INTRODUCTION,"_""Nay, but you who do not love her,"
772,INTRODUCTION,"Is she not pure gold, my mistress?"
773,INTRODUCTION,Holds earth aught--speak truth--above her?
774,INTRODUCTION,"Aught like this tress, see, and this tress,"
775,INTRODUCTION,"And this last fairest tress of all,"
776,INTRODUCTION,"--So fair, see, ere I let it fall?_"
777,INTRODUCTION,
778,INTRODUCTION,"_""Because, you spend your lives in praisings,"
779,INTRODUCTION,"To praise, you search the wide world over:"
780,INTRODUCTION,"Then why not witness, calmly gazing,"
781,INTRODUCTION,If earth holds aught--speak truth--above her?
782,INTRODUCTION,"Above this tress, and this I touch,"
783,INTRODUCTION,"But cannot praise, I love so much!""_"
784,INTRODUCTION,
785,INTRODUCTION,_And so is this:--_
786,INTRODUCTION,
787,INTRODUCTION,"_""Under the wide and starry sky,"
788,INTRODUCTION,Dig the grave and let me lie.
789,INTRODUCTION,"Glad did I live and gladly die,"
790,INTRODUCTION,And I laid me down with a will._
791,INTRODUCTION,
792,INTRODUCTION,"_""This be the verse yon grave for me:"
793,INTRODUCTION,Here he lies where he longed to be;
794,INTRODUCTION,"Home is the sailor, home from sea,"
795,INTRODUCTION,"And the hunter home from the hill.""_"
796,INTRODUCTION,
797,INTRODUCTION,_But who would believe that the writers of these were contemporaries?_
798,INTRODUCTION,
799,INTRODUCTION,_If we examine more closely the forms which lyric poetry has taken since
800,INTRODUCTION,"1830, we shall find that certain influences at work in the minds of our"
801,INTRODUCTION,leading writers have led to the widest divergence in the character of
802,INTRODUCTION,"lyrical verse. It will be well, perhaps, to consider in turn the leading"
803,INTRODUCTION,classes of that work. It was not to be expected that in an age of such
804,INTRODUCTION,"complexity and self-consciousness as ours, the pure song, the simple"
805,INTRODUCTION,"trill of bird-like melody, should often or prominently be heard. As"
806,INTRODUCTION,"civilization spreads, it ceases to be possible, or at least it becomes"
807,INTRODUCTION,"less and less usual, that simple emotion should express itself with"
808,INTRODUCTION,absolute naïveté. Perhaps Burns was the latest poet in these islands
809,INTRODUCTION,whose passion warbled forth in perfectly artless strains; and he had the
810,INTRODUCTION,advantage of using a dialect still unsubdued and unvulgarized.
811,INTRODUCTION,Artlessness nowadays must be the result of the most exquisitely finished
812,INTRODUCTION,"art; if not, it is apt to be insipid, if not positively squalid and"
813,INTRODUCTION,"fusty. The obvious uses of simple words have been exhausted; we cannot,"
814,INTRODUCTION,"save by infinite pains and the exercise of a happy genius, recover the"
815,INTRODUCTION,"old spontaneous air, the effect of an inevitable arrangement of the only"
816,INTRODUCTION,possible words._
817,INTRODUCTION,
818,INTRODUCTION,"_This beautiful direct simplicity, however, was not infrequently secured"
819,INTRODUCTION,"by Tennyson, and scarcely less often by Christina Rossetti, both of whom"
820,INTRODUCTION,have left behind them jets of pure emotional melody which compare to
821,INTRODUCTION,advantage with the most perfect specimens of Greek and Elizabethan song.
822,INTRODUCTION,"Tennyson did not very often essay this class of writing, but when he"
823,INTRODUCTION,"did, he rarely failed; his songs combine, with extreme naturalness and"
824,INTRODUCTION,"something of a familiar sweetness, a felicity of workmanship hardly to"
825,INTRODUCTION,"be excelled. In her best songs, Miss Rossetti is scarcely, if at all,"
826,INTRODUCTION,"his inferior; but her judgment was far less sure, and she was more ready"
827,INTRODUCTION,to look with complacency on her failures. The songs of Mr. Aubrey de
828,INTRODUCTION,Vere are not well enough known; they are sometimes singularly charming.
829,INTRODUCTION,Other poets have once or twice succeeded in catching this clear natural
830,INTRODUCTION,"treble,--the living linnet once captured in the elm, as Tusitala puts"
831,INTRODUCTION,it; but this has not been a gift largely enjoyed by our Victorian
832,INTRODUCTION,poets._
833,INTRODUCTION,
834,INTRODUCTION,"_The richer and more elaborate forms of lyric, on the contrary, have"
835,INTRODUCTION,exactly suited this curious and learned age of ours. The species of
836,INTRODUCTION,"verse which, originally Italian or French, have now so abundantly and so"
837,INTRODUCTION,admirably been practised in England that we can no longer think of them
838,INTRODUCTION,"as exotic, having found so many exponents in the Victorian period that"
839,INTRODUCTION,"they are pre-eminently characteristic of it. ""Scorn not the Sonnet,"""
840,INTRODUCTION,said Wordsworth to his contemporaries; but the lesson has not been
841,INTRODUCTION,needed in the second half of the century. The sonnet is the most solid
842,INTRODUCTION,and unsingable of the sections of lyrical poetry; it is difficult to
843,INTRODUCTION,think of it as chanted to a musical accompaniment. It is used with great
844,INTRODUCTION,distinction by writers to whom skill in the lighter divisions of poetry
845,INTRODUCTION,"has been denied, and there are poets, such as Bowles and Charles"
846,INTRODUCTION,"Tennyson-Turner, who live by their sonnets alone. The practice of the"
847,INTRODUCTION,sonnet has been so extended that all sense of monotony has been lost. A
848,INTRODUCTION,sonnet by Elizabeth Barrett Browning differs from one by D. G. Rossetti
849,INTRODUCTION,or by Matthew Arnold to such excess as to make it difficult for us to
850,INTRODUCTION,realize that the form in each case is absolutely identical._
851,INTRODUCTION,
852,INTRODUCTION,_With the sonnet might be mentioned the lighter forms of elaborate
853,INTRODUCTION,exotic verse; but to these a word shall be given later on. More closely
854,INTRODUCTION,allied to the sonnet are those rich and somewhat fantastic
855,INTRODUCTION,stanza-measures in which Rossetti delighted. Those in which Keats and
856,INTRODUCTION,the Italians have each their part have been greatly used by the
857,INTRODUCTION,"Victorian poets. They lend themselves to a melancholy magnificence, to"
858,INTRODUCTION,pomp of movement and gorgeousness of color; the very sight of them gives
859,INTRODUCTION,the page the look of an ancient blazoned window. Poems of this class are
860,INTRODUCTION,"""The Stream's Secret"" and the choruses in ""Love is enough."" They satisfy"
861,INTRODUCTION,"the appetite of our time for subtle and vague analysis of emotion, for"
862,INTRODUCTION,"what appeals to the spirit through the senses; but here, again, in"
863,INTRODUCTION,"different hands, the ""thing,"" the metrical instrument, takes wholly"
864,INTRODUCTION,"diverse characters, and we seek in vain for a formula that can include"
865,INTRODUCTION,"Robert Browning and Gabriel Rossetti, William Barnes and Arthur Hugh"
866,INTRODUCTION,Clough._
867,INTRODUCTION,
868,INTRODUCTION,_From this highly elaborated and extended species of lyric the
869,INTRODUCTION,"transition is easy to the Ode. In the Victorian age, the ode, in its"
870,INTRODUCTION,"full Pindaric sense, has not been very frequently used. We have"
871,INTRODUCTION,specimens by Mr. Swinburne in which the Dorian laws are closely adhered
872,INTRODUCTION,"to. But the ode, in a more or less irregular form, whether pæan or"
873,INTRODUCTION,"threnody, has been the instrument of several of our leading lyrists. The"
874,INTRODUCTION,"genius of Mr. Swinburne, even to a greater degree than that of Shelley,"
875,INTRODUCTION,"is essentially dithyrambic, and is never happier than when it spreads"
876,INTRODUCTION,"its wings as wide as those of the wild swan, and soars upon the very"
877,INTRODUCTION,breast of tempest. In these flights Mr. Swinburne attains to a volume of
878,INTRODUCTION,"sonorous melody such as no other poet, perhaps, of the world has"
879,INTRODUCTION,"reached, and we may say to him, as he has shouted to the Mater"
880,INTRODUCTION,Triumphalis:--_
881,INTRODUCTION,
882,INTRODUCTION,"_""Darkness to daylight shall lift up thy pæan,"
883,INTRODUCTION,"Hill to hill thunder, vale cry back to vale,"
884,INTRODUCTION,"With wind-notes as of eagles Æschylean,"
885,INTRODUCTION,"And Sappho singing in the nightingale.""_"
886,INTRODUCTION,
887,INTRODUCTION,_Nothing could mark more picturesquely the wide diversity permitted in
888,INTRODUCTION,Victorian lyric than to turn from the sonorous and tumultuous odes of
889,INTRODUCTION,"Mr. Swinburne to those of Mr. Patmore, in which stateliness of"
890,INTRODUCTION,contemplation and a peculiar austerity of tenderness find their
891,INTRODUCTION,"expression in odes of iambic cadence, the melody of which depends, not"
892,INTRODUCTION,"in their headlong torrent of sound, but in the cunning variation of"
893,INTRODUCTION,catalectic pause. A similar form has been adopted by Lord De Tabley for
894,INTRODUCTION,"many of his gorgeous studies of antique myth, and by Tennyson for his"
895,INTRODUCTION,"""Death of the Duke of Wellington."" It is an error to call these iambic"
896,INTRODUCTION,"odes ""irregular,"" although they do not follow the classic rules with"
897,INTRODUCTION,"strophe, antistrophe, and epode. The enchanting ""I have led her"
898,INTRODUCTION,"home,"" in ""Maud,"" is an example of this kind of lyric at its highest"
899,INTRODUCTION,point of perfection._
900,INTRODUCTION,
901,INTRODUCTION,_A branch of lyrical poetry which has been very widely cultivated in the
902,INTRODUCTION,"Victorian age is the philosophical, or gnomic, in which a serious chain"
903,INTRODUCTION,"of thought, often illustrated by complex and various imagery, is held in"
904,INTRODUCTION,"a casket of melodious verse, elaborately rhymed. Matthew Arnold was a"
905,INTRODUCTION,"master of this kind of poetry, which takes its form, through Wordsworth,"
906,INTRODUCTION,"from the solemn and so-called ""metaphysical"" writers of the seventeenth"
907,INTRODUCTION,century. We class this interesting and abundant section of verse with
908,INTRODUCTION,"the lyrical, because we know not by what other name to describe it; yet"
909,INTRODUCTION,it has obviously as little as possible of the singing ecstasy about it.
910,INTRODUCTION,"It neither pours its heart out in a rapture, nor wails forth its"
911,INTRODUCTION,despair. It has as little of the nightingale's rich melancholy as of the
912,INTRODUCTION,"lark's delirium. It hardly sings, but, with infinite decorum and"
913,INTRODUCTION,"sobriety, speaks its melodious message to mankind. This sort of"
914,INTRODUCTION,philosophical poetry is really critical; its function is to analyze and
915,INTRODUCTION,"describe; and it approaches, save for the enchantment of its form,"
916,INTRODUCTION,"nearer to prose than do the other sections of the art. It is, however,"
917,INTRODUCTION,just this species of poetry which has particularly appealed to the age
918,INTRODUCTION,in which we live; and how naturally it does so may be seen in the
919,INTRODUCTION,welcome extended to the polished and serene compositions of Mr. William
920,INTRODUCTION,Watson._
921,INTRODUCTION,
922,INTRODUCTION,"_Almost a creation, or at least a complete conquest, of the Victorian"
923,INTRODUCTION,age is the humorous lyric in its more delicate developments. If the past
924,INTRODUCTION,"can point to Prior and to Praed, we can boast, in their various"
925,INTRODUCTION,"departments, of Calverly, of Locker-Lampson, of Mr. Andrew Lang, of"
926,INTRODUCTION,"Mr. W. S. Gilbert. The comic muse, indeed, has marvellously extended her"
927,INTRODUCTION,"blandishments during the last two generations, and has discovered"
928,INTRODUCTION,methods of trivial elegance which were quite unknown to our forefathers.
929,INTRODUCTION,Here must certainly be said a word in favor of those French forms of
930,INTRODUCTION,"verse, all essentially lyrical, such as the ballad, the rondel, the"
931,INTRODUCTION,"triolet, which have been used so abundantly as to become quite a feature"
932,INTRODUCTION,"in our lighter literature. These are not, or are but rarely, fitted to"
933,INTRODUCTION,"bear the burden of high emotion; but their precision, and the deftness"
934,INTRODUCTION,which their use demands fit them exceedingly well for the more
935,INTRODUCTION,distinguished kind of persiflage. No one has kept these delicate
936,INTRODUCTION,butterflies in flight with the agile movement of his fan so admirably as
937,INTRODUCTION,"Mr. Austin Dobson, that neatest of magicians._"
938,INTRODUCTION,
939,INTRODUCTION,_Those who write hastily of Victorian lyrical poetry are apt to find
940,INTRODUCTION,fault with its lack of spontaneity. It is true that we cannot pretend to
941,INTRODUCTION,discover on a greensward so often crossed and re-crossed as the poetic
942,INTRODUCTION,language of England many morning dewdrops still glistening on the
943,INTRODUCTION,grasses. We have to pay the penalty of our experience in a certain lack
944,INTRODUCTION,of innocence. The artless graces of a child seem mincing affectations in
945,INTRODUCTION,a grown-up woman. But the poetry of this age has amply made up for any
946,INTRODUCTION,"lack of innocence by its sumptuous fulness, its variety, its magnificent"
947,INTRODUCTION,"accomplishment, its felicitous response to a multitude of moods and"
948,INTRODUCTION,apprehensions. It has struck out no new field for itself; it still
949,INTRODUCTION,remains where the romantic revolution of 1798 placed it; its aims are
950,INTRODUCTION,not other than were those of Coleridge and of Keats. But within that
951,INTRODUCTION,defined sphere it has developed a surprising activity. It has occupied
952,INTRODUCTION,the attention and become the facile instrument of men of the greatest
953,INTRODUCTION,"genius, writers of whom any age and any language might be proud. It has"
954,INTRODUCTION,"been tender and fiery, severe and voluminous, gorgeous and marmoreal, in"
955,INTRODUCTION,"turns. It has translated into words feelings so subtle, so transitory,"
956,INTRODUCTION,"moods so fragile and intangible, that the rough hand of prose would but"
957,INTRODUCTION,"have crushed them. And this, surely, indicates the great gift of"
958,INTRODUCTION,Victorian lyrical poetry to the race. During a time of extreme mental
959,INTRODUCTION,"and moral restlessness, a time of speculation and evolution, when all"
960,INTRODUCTION,"illusions are tested, all conventions overthrown, when the harder"
961,INTRODUCTION,"elements of life have been brought violently to the front, and where"
962,INTRODUCTION,there is a temptation for the emancipated mind roughly to reject what is
963,INTRODUCTION,"not material and obvious, this art has preserved intact the lovelier"
964,INTRODUCTION,"delusions of the spirit, all that is vague and incorporeal and illusory."
965,INTRODUCTION,So that for Victorian Lyric generally no better final definition can be
966,INTRODUCTION,given than is supplied by Mr. Robert Bridges in a little poem of
967,INTRODUCTION,"incomparable beauty, which may fitly bring this essay to a close:--_"
968,INTRODUCTION,
969,INTRODUCTION,"_""I have loved flowers that fade,"
970,INTRODUCTION,Within whose magic tents
971,INTRODUCTION,Rich hues have marriage made
