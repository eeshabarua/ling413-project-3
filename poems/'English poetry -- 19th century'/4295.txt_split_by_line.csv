70,THE SONG OF THE BOW,
71,THE SONG OF THE BOW,
72,THE SONG OF THE BOW,What of the bow?
73,THE SONG OF THE BOW,The bow was made in England:
74,THE SONG OF THE BOW,"Of true wood, of yew-wood,"
75,THE SONG OF THE BOW,The wood of English bows;
76,THE SONG OF THE BOW,So men who are free
77,THE SONG OF THE BOW,Love the old yew-tree
78,THE SONG OF THE BOW,And the land where the yew-tree grows.
79,THE SONG OF THE BOW,
80,THE SONG OF THE BOW,What of the cord?
81,THE SONG OF THE BOW,The cord was made in England:
82,THE SONG OF THE BOW,"A rough cord, a tough cord,"
83,THE SONG OF THE BOW,A cord that bowmen love;
84,THE SONG OF THE BOW,And so we will sing
85,THE SONG OF THE BOW,Of the hempen string
86,THE SONG OF THE BOW,And the land where the cord was wove.
87,THE SONG OF THE BOW,
88,THE SONG OF THE BOW,What of the shaft?
89,THE SONG OF THE BOW,The shaft was cut in England:
90,THE SONG OF THE BOW,"A long shaft, a strong shaft,"
91,THE SONG OF THE BOW,Barbed and trim and true;
92,THE SONG OF THE BOW,So we’ll drink all together
93,THE SONG OF THE BOW,To the grey goose-feather
94,THE SONG OF THE BOW,And the land where the grey goose flew.
95,THE SONG OF THE BOW,
96,THE SONG OF THE BOW,What of the mark?
97,THE SONG OF THE BOW,"Ah, seek it not in England,"
98,THE SONG OF THE BOW,"A bold mark, our old mark"
99,THE SONG OF THE BOW,Is waiting over-sea.
100,THE SONG OF THE BOW,"When the strings harp in chorus,"
101,THE SONG OF THE BOW,"And the lion flag is o’er us,"
102,THE SONG OF THE BOW,It is there that our mark will be.
103,THE SONG OF THE BOW,
104,THE SONG OF THE BOW,What of the men?
105,THE SONG OF THE BOW,The men were bred in England:
106,THE SONG OF THE BOW,"The bowmen—the yeomen,"
107,THE SONG OF THE BOW,The lads of dale and fell.
108,THE SONG OF THE BOW,Here’s to you—and to you!
109,THE SONG OF THE BOW,To the hearts that are true
110,THE SONG OF THE BOW,And the land where the true hearts dwell.

116,CREMONA,
117,CREMONA,
118,CREMONA,"[The French Army, including a part of the Irish Brigade, under Marshal"
119,CREMONA,"Villeroy, held the fortified town of Cremona during the winter of 1702."
120,CREMONA,"Prince Eugène, with the Imperial Army, surprised it one morning, and,"
121,CREMONA,"owing to the treachery of a priest, occupied the whole city before the"
122,CREMONA,"alarm was given.  Villeroy was captured, together with many of the French"
123,CREMONA,"garrison.  The Irish, however, consisting of the regiments of Dillon and"
124,CREMONA,"of Burke, held a fort commanding the river gate, and defended themselves"
125,CREMONA,"all day, in spite of Prince Eugène’s efforts to win them over to his"
126,CREMONA,"cause.  Eventually Eugène, being unable to take the post, was compelled"
127,CREMONA,to withdraw from the city.]
128,CREMONA,
129,CREMONA,The Grenadiers of Austria are proper men and tall;
130,CREMONA,The Grenadiers of Austria have scaled the city wall;
131,CREMONA,They have marched from far away
132,CREMONA,"Ere the dawning of the day,"
133,CREMONA,And the morning saw them masters of Cremona.
134,CREMONA,
135,CREMONA,"There’s not a man to whisper, there’s not a horse to neigh;"
136,CREMONA,"Of the footmen of Lorraine and the riders of Duprés,"
137,CREMONA,"They have crept up every street,"
138,CREMONA,"In the market-place they meet,"
139,CREMONA,They are holding every vantage in Cremona.
140,CREMONA,
141,CREMONA,The Marshal Villeroy he has started from his bed;
142,CREMONA,The Marshal Villeroy has no wig upon his head;
143,CREMONA,"‘I have lost my men!’ quoth he,"
144,CREMONA,"‘And my men they have lost me,"
145,CREMONA,And I sorely fear we both have lost Cremona.’
146,CREMONA,
147,CREMONA,Prince Eugène of Austria is in the market-place;
148,CREMONA,Prince Eugène of Austria has smiles upon his face;
149,CREMONA,"Says he, ‘Our work is done,"
150,CREMONA,"For the Citadel is won,"
151,CREMONA,And the black and yellow flag flies o’er Cremona.’
152,CREMONA,
153,CREMONA,"Major Dan O’Mahony is in the barrack square,"
154,CREMONA,And just six hundred Irish lads are waiting for him there;
155,CREMONA,"Says he, ‘Come in your shirt,"
156,CREMONA,"And you won’t take any hurt,"
157,CREMONA,For the morning air is pleasant in Cremona.’
158,CREMONA,
159,CREMONA,"Major Dan O’Mahony is at the barrack gate,"
160,CREMONA,And just six hundred Irish lads will neither stay nor wait;
161,CREMONA,"There’s Dillon and there’s Burke,"
162,CREMONA,And there’ll be some bloody work
163,CREMONA,Ere the Kaiserlics shall boast they hold Cremona.
164,CREMONA,
165,CREMONA,"Major Dan O’Mahony has reached the river fort,"
166,CREMONA,And just six hundred Irish lads are joining in the sport;
167,CREMONA,"‘Come, take a hand!’ says he,"
168,CREMONA,"‘And if you will stand by me,"
169,CREMONA,Then it’s glory to the man who takes Cremona!’
170,CREMONA,
171,CREMONA,"Prince Eugène of Austria has frowns upon his face,"
172,CREMONA,And loud he calls his Galloper of Irish blood and race:
173,CREMONA,"‘MacDonnell, ride, I pray,"
174,CREMONA,"To your countrymen, and say"
175,CREMONA,That only they are left in all Cremona!’
176,CREMONA,
177,CREMONA,"MacDonnell he has reined his mare beside the river dyke,"
178,CREMONA,And he has tied the parley flag upon a sergeant’s pike;
179,CREMONA,Six companies were there
180,CREMONA,"From Limerick and Clare,"
181,CREMONA,The last of all the guardians of Cremona.
182,CREMONA,
183,CREMONA,"‘Now, Major Dan O’Mahony, give up the river gate,"
184,CREMONA,"Or, Major Dan O’Mahony, you’ll find it is too late;"
185,CREMONA,For when I gallop back
186,CREMONA,"’Tis the signal for attack,"
187,CREMONA,And no quarter for the Irish in Cremona!’
188,CREMONA,
189,CREMONA,"And Major Dan he laughed: ‘Faith, if what you say be true,"
190,CREMONA,"And if they will not come until they hear again from you,"
191,CREMONA,"Then there will be no attack,"
192,CREMONA,"For you’re never going back,"
193,CREMONA,And we’ll keep you snug and safely in Cremona.’
194,CREMONA,
195,CREMONA,"All the weary day the German stormers came,"
196,CREMONA,"All the weary day they were faced by fire and flame,"
197,CREMONA,"They have filled the ditch with dead,"
198,CREMONA,And the river’s running red;
199,CREMONA,But they cannot win the gateway of Cremona.
200,CREMONA,
201,CREMONA,"All the weary day, again, again, again,"
202,CREMONA,"The horsemen of Duprés and the footmen of Lorraine,"
203,CREMONA,"Taafe and Herberstein,"
204,CREMONA,And the riders of the Rhine;
205,CREMONA,It’s a mighty price they’re paying for Cremona.
206,CREMONA,
207,CREMONA,"Time and time they came with the deep-mouthed German roar,"
208,CREMONA,Time and time they broke like the wave upon the shore;
209,CREMONA,For better men were there
210,CREMONA,"From Limerick and Clare,"
211,CREMONA,And who will take the gateway of Cremona?
212,CREMONA,
213,CREMONA,"Prince Eugène has watched, and he gnaws his nether lip;"
214,CREMONA,Prince Eugène has cursed as he saw his chances slip:
215,CREMONA,"‘Call off!  Call off!’ he cried,"
216,CREMONA,"‘It is nearing eventide,"
217,CREMONA,And I fear our work is finished in Cremona.’
218,CREMONA,
219,CREMONA,"Says Wauchop to McAulliffe, ‘Their fire is growing slack.’"
220,CREMONA,"Says Major Dan O’Mahony, ‘It is their last attack;"
221,CREMONA,But who will stop the game
222,CREMONA,"While there’s light to play the same,"
223,CREMONA,And to walk a short way with them from Cremona?’
224,CREMONA,
225,CREMONA,"And so they snarl behind them, and beg them turn and come,"
226,CREMONA,"They have taken Neuberg’s standard, they have taken Diak’s drum;"
227,CREMONA,"And along the winding Po,"
228,CREMONA,"Beard on shoulder, stern and slow"
229,CREMONA,The Kaiserlics are riding from Cremona.
230,CREMONA,
231,CREMONA,Just two hundred Irish lads are shouting on the wall;
232,CREMONA,Four hundred more are lying who can hear no slogan call;
233,CREMONA,"But what’s the odds of that,"
234,CREMONA,For it’s all the same to Pat
235,CREMONA,If he pays his debt in Dublin or Cremona.
236,CREMONA,
237,CREMONA,"Says General de Vaudray, ‘You’ve done a soldier’s work!"
238,CREMONA,And every tongue in France shall talk of Dillon and of Burke!
239,CREMONA,"Ask what you will this day,"
240,CREMONA,"And be it what it may,"
241,CREMONA,It is granted to the heroes of Cremona.’
242,CREMONA,
243,CREMONA,"‘Why, then,’ says Dan O’Mahony, ‘one favour we entreat,"
244,CREMONA,"We were called a little early, and our toilet’s not complete."
245,CREMONA,"We’ve no quarrel with the shirt,"
246,CREMONA,"But the breeches wouldn’t hurt,"
247,CREMONA,For the evening air is chilly in Cremona.’

253,THE STORMING PARTY,
254,THE STORMING PARTY,
255,THE STORMING PARTY,"Said Paul Leroy to Barrow,"
256,THE STORMING PARTY,"‘Though the breach is steep and narrow,"
257,THE STORMING PARTY,If we only gain the summit
258,THE STORMING PARTY,Then it’s odds we hold the fort.
259,THE STORMING PARTY,"I have ten and you have twenty,"
260,THE STORMING PARTY,"And the thirty should be plenty,"
261,THE STORMING PARTY,With Henderson and Henty
262,THE STORMING PARTY,And McDermott in support.’
263,THE STORMING PARTY,
264,THE STORMING PARTY,"Said Barrow to Leroy,"
265,THE STORMING PARTY,"‘It’s a solid job, my boy,"
266,THE STORMING PARTY,"For they’ve flanked it, and they’ve banked it,"
267,THE STORMING PARTY,And they’ve bored it with a mine.
268,THE STORMING PARTY,But it’s only fifty paces
269,THE STORMING PARTY,Ere we look them in the faces;
270,THE STORMING PARTY,"And the men are in their places,"
271,THE STORMING PARTY,With their toes upon the line.’
272,THE STORMING PARTY,
273,THE STORMING PARTY,"Said Paul Leroy to Barrow,"
274,THE STORMING PARTY,"‘See that first ray, like an arrow,"
275,THE STORMING PARTY,How it tinges all the fringes
276,THE STORMING PARTY,Of the sullen drifting skies.
277,THE STORMING PARTY,They told me to begin it
278,THE STORMING PARTY,"At five-thirty to the minute,"
279,THE STORMING PARTY,"And at thirty-one I’m in it,"
280,THE STORMING PARTY,Or my sub will get his rise.
281,THE STORMING PARTY,
282,THE STORMING PARTY,"‘So we’ll wait the signal rocket,"
283,THE STORMING PARTY,"Till . . . Barrow, show that locket,"
284,THE STORMING PARTY,"That turquoise-studded locket,"
285,THE STORMING PARTY,Which you slipped from out your pocket
286,THE STORMING PARTY,And are pressing with a kiss!
287,THE STORMING PARTY,"Turquoise-studded, spiral-twisted,"
288,THE STORMING PARTY,It is hers!  And I had missed it
289,THE STORMING PARTY,From her chain; and you have kissed it:
290,THE STORMING PARTY,"Barrow, villain, what is this?’"
291,THE STORMING PARTY,
292,THE STORMING PARTY,"‘Leroy, I had a warning,"
293,THE STORMING PARTY,"That my time has come this morning,"
294,THE STORMING PARTY,"So I speak with frankness, scorning"
295,THE STORMING PARTY,To deny the thing that’s true.
296,THE STORMING PARTY,"Yes, it’s Amy’s, is the trinket,"
297,THE STORMING PARTY,"Little turquoise-studded trinket,"
298,THE STORMING PARTY,"Not her gift—oh, never think it!"
299,THE STORMING PARTY,For her thoughts were all for you.
300,THE STORMING PARTY,
301,THE STORMING PARTY,‘As we danced I gently drew it
302,THE STORMING PARTY,From her chain—she never knew it
303,THE STORMING PARTY,"But I love her—yes, I love her:"
304,THE STORMING PARTY,"I am candid, I confess."
305,THE STORMING PARTY,"But I never told her, never,"
306,THE STORMING PARTY,"For I knew ’twas vain endeavour,"
307,THE STORMING PARTY,"And she loved you—loved you ever,"
308,THE STORMING PARTY,Would to God she loved you less!’
309,THE STORMING PARTY,
310,THE STORMING PARTY,"‘Barrow, Barrow, you shall pay me!"
311,THE STORMING PARTY,"Me, your comrade, to betray me!"
312,THE STORMING PARTY,Well I know that little Amy
313,THE STORMING PARTY,Is as true as wife can be.
314,THE STORMING PARTY,She to give this love-badged locket!
315,THE STORMING PARTY,"She had rather . . . Ha, the rocket!"
316,THE STORMING PARTY,"Hi, McDougall!  Sound the bugle!"
317,THE STORMING PARTY,"Yorkshires, Yorkshires, follow me!’"

321,THE STORMING PARTY,"Said Paul Leroy to Amy,"
322,THE STORMING PARTY,"‘Well, wifie, you may blame me,"
323,THE STORMING PARTY,"For my passion overcame me,"
324,THE STORMING PARTY,When he told me of his shame;
325,THE STORMING PARTY,"But when I saw him lying,"
326,THE STORMING PARTY,"Dead amid a ring of dying,"
327,THE STORMING PARTY,"Why, poor devil, I was trying"
328,THE STORMING PARTY,"To forget, and not to blame."
329,THE STORMING PARTY,
330,THE STORMING PARTY,"‘And this locket, I unclasped it"
331,THE STORMING PARTY,From the fingers that still grasped it:
332,THE STORMING PARTY,"He told me how he got it,"
333,THE STORMING PARTY,How he stole it in a valse.’
334,THE STORMING PARTY,And she listened leaden-hearted:
335,THE STORMING PARTY,"Oh, the weary day they parted!"
336,THE STORMING PARTY,"For she loved him—yes, she loved him—"
337,THE STORMING PARTY,"For his youth and for his truth,"
338,THE STORMING PARTY,"And for those dying words, so false."

346,THE FRONTIER LINE,What marks the frontier line?

348,THE FRONTIER LINE,"Is it the Himalayas sheer,"
349,THE FRONTIER LINE,"The rocks and valleys of Cashmere,"
350,THE FRONTIER LINE,Or Indus as she seeks the south
351,THE FRONTIER LINE,From Attoch to the fivefold mouth?
352,THE FRONTIER LINE,‘Not that!  Not that!’
353,THE FRONTIER LINE,"Then answer me, I pray!"
354,THE FRONTIER LINE,What marks the frontier line?
355,THE FRONTIER LINE,

403,A BALLAD OF ’82,The Eastern day was well-nigh o’er
404,A BALLAD OF ’82,"When, parched with thirst and travel sore,"
405,A BALLAD OF ’82,Two of McPherson’s flanking corps
406,A BALLAD OF ’82,Across the Desert were tramping.
407,A BALLAD OF ’82,They had wandered off from the beaten track
408,A BALLAD OF ’82,"And now were wearily harking back,"
409,A BALLAD OF ’82,Ever staring round for the signal jack
410,A BALLAD OF ’82,That marked their comrades camping.
411,A BALLAD OF ’82,
412,A BALLAD OF ’82,"The one was Corporal Robert Dick,"
413,A BALLAD OF ’82,"Bearded and burly, short and thick,"
414,A BALLAD OF ’82,"Rough of speech and in temper quick,"
415,A BALLAD OF ’82,A hard-faced old rapscallion.
416,A BALLAD OF ’82,"The other, fresh from the barrack square,"
417,A BALLAD OF ’82,"Was a raw recruit, smooth-cheeked and fair"
418,A BALLAD OF ’82,"Half grown, half drilled, with the weedy air"
419,A BALLAD OF ’82,Of a draft from the home battalion.
420,A BALLAD OF ’82,
421,A BALLAD OF ’82,"Weary and parched and hunger-torn,"
422,A BALLAD OF ’82,"They had wandered on from early morn,"
423,A BALLAD OF ’82,"And the young boy-soldier limped forlorn,"
424,A BALLAD OF ’82,Now stumbling and now falling.
425,A BALLAD OF ’82,"Around the orange sand-curves lay,"
426,A BALLAD OF ’82,"Flecked with boulders, black or grey,"

428,A BALLAD OF ’82,A kite was shrilly calling.

430,A BALLAD OF ’82,A kite?  Was _that_ a kite?  The yell
431,A BALLAD OF ’82,That shrilly rose and faintly fell?
432,A BALLAD OF ’82,"No kite’s, and yet the kite knows well"
433,A BALLAD OF ’82,The long-drawn wild halloo.
434,A BALLAD OF ’82,And right athwart the evening sky
435,A BALLAD OF ’82,"The yellow sand-spray spurtled high,"
436,A BALLAD OF ’82,And shrill and shriller swelled the cry
437,A BALLAD OF ’82,Of ‘Allah!  Allahu!’
438,A BALLAD OF ’82,
439,A BALLAD OF ’82,"The Corporal peered at the crimson West,"
440,A BALLAD OF ’82,Hid his pipe in his khaki vest.
441,A BALLAD OF ’82,"Growled out an oath and onward pressed,"
442,A BALLAD OF ’82,Still glancing over his shoulder.
443,A BALLAD OF ’82,"‘Bedouins, mate!’ he curtly said;"
444,A BALLAD OF ’82,"‘We’ll find some work for steel and lead,"
445,A BALLAD OF ’82,"And maybe sleep in a sandy bed,"
446,A BALLAD OF ’82,Before we’re one hour older.

452,A BALLAD OF ’82,"With a curse and a prayer the two faced round,"
453,A BALLAD OF ’82,"Dogged and grim they stood their ground,"
454,A BALLAD OF ’82,And their breech-blocks snapped with a crisp clean sound
455,A BALLAD OF ’82,As the rifles sprang to the ‘ready.’
456,A BALLAD OF ’82,
457,A BALLAD OF ’82,Alas for the Emir Ali Khan!
458,A BALLAD OF ’82,"A hundred paces before his clan,"
459,A BALLAD OF ’82,That ebony steed of the prophet’s breed

463,A BALLAD OF ’82,"The chief was down, and his bridle rein"
464,A BALLAD OF ’82,Was in the grip of the stranger.
465,A BALLAD OF ’82,
466,A BALLAD OF ’82,"With the light of hope on his rugged face,"
467,A BALLAD OF ’82,"The Corporal sprang to the dead man’s place,"
468,A BALLAD OF ’82,"One prick with the steel, one thrust with the heel,"
469,A BALLAD OF ’82,And where was the man to outride him?
470,A BALLAD OF ’82,"A grip of his knees, a toss of his rein,"
471,A BALLAD OF ’82,"He was settling her down to her gallop again,"
472,A BALLAD OF ’82,"When he stopped, for he heard just one faltering word"
473,A BALLAD OF ’82,From the young recruit beside him.
474,A BALLAD OF ’82,
475,A BALLAD OF ’82,"One faltering word from pal to pal,"
476,A BALLAD OF ’82,But it found the heart of the Corporal.
477,A BALLAD OF ’82,"He had sprung to the sand, he had lent him a hand,"
478,A BALLAD OF ’82,"‘Up, mate!  They’ll be ’ere in a minute;"
479,A BALLAD OF ’82,Off with you!  No palaver!  Go!
480,A BALLAD OF ’82,I’ll bide be’ind and run this show.
481,A BALLAD OF ’82,"Promotion has been cursed slow,"

483,A BALLAD OF ’82,
484,A BALLAD OF ’82,"Into the saddle he thrust him quick,"
485,A BALLAD OF ’82,Spurred the black mare with a bayonet prick.
486,A BALLAD OF ’82,Watched her gallop with plunge and with kick
487,A BALLAD OF ’82,Away o’er the desert careering.
488,A BALLAD OF ’82,"Then he turned with a softened face,"
489,A BALLAD OF ’82,"And loosened the strap of his cartridge-case,"
490,A BALLAD OF ’82,While his thoughts flew back to the dear old place
491,A BALLAD OF ’82,In the sunny Hampshire clearing.
492,A BALLAD OF ’82,
493,A BALLAD OF ’82,"The young boy-private, glancing back,"
494,A BALLAD OF ’82,"Saw the Bedouins’ wild attack,"
495,A BALLAD OF ’82,And heard the sharp Martini crack.
496,A BALLAD OF ’82,"But as he gazed, already"
497,A BALLAD OF ’82,The fierce fanatic Arab band
498,A BALLAD OF ’82,"Was closing in on every hand,"

873,THE DYING WHIP,And ’ackin’ back to kennels from a ninety-minute run;
874,THE DYING WHIP,"‘I guess I’ve copped brownchitis,’ says I to brother Jack,"
875,THE DYING WHIP,An’ then afore I knowed it I was down upon my back.
876,THE DYING WHIP,
877,THE DYING WHIP,"At night there came a sweatin’ as left me deadly weak,"
878,THE DYING WHIP,And my throat was sort of tickly an’ it ’urt me for to speak;
879,THE DYING WHIP,"An’ then there came an ’ackin’ cough as wouldn’t leave alone,"
880,THE DYING WHIP,An’ then afore I knowed it I was only skin and bone
881,THE DYING WHIP,
882,THE DYING WHIP,"I never was a ’eavy weight.  I scaled at seven four,"
883,THE DYING WHIP,"An’ rode at eight, or maybe at just a trifle more;"
884,THE DYING WHIP,"And now I’ll stake my davy I wouldn’t scale at five,"
885,THE DYING WHIP,And I’d ’old my own at catch-weights with the skinniest jock alive.
886,THE DYING WHIP,
887,THE DYING WHIP,And the doctor says the reason why I sit an’ cough an wheeze
888,THE DYING WHIP,"Is all along o’ varmint, like the cheese-mites in the cheese;"
889,THE DYING WHIP,"The smallest kind o’ varmint, but varmint all the same,"
890,THE DYING WHIP,Microscopes or somethin’—I forget the varmints’ name.
891,THE DYING WHIP,
892,THE DYING WHIP,"But I knows as I’m a goner.  They never said as much,"
893,THE DYING WHIP,"But I reads the people’s faces, and I knows as I am such;"
894,THE DYING WHIP,"Well, there’s ’Urst to mind the ’orses and the ’ounds can look to"
895,THE DYING WHIP,"Jack,"
896,THE DYING WHIP,Though ’e never was a patch on me in ’andlin’ of a pack.
897,THE DYING WHIP,
898,THE DYING WHIP,"You’ll maybe think I’m boastin’, but you’ll find they all agree"
899,THE DYING WHIP,That there’s not a whip in Surrey as can ’andle ’ounds like me;
900,THE DYING WHIP,"For I knew ’em all from puppies, and I’d tell ’em without fail—"
901,THE DYING WHIP,"If I seed a tail a-waggin’, I could tell who wagged the tail."
902,THE DYING WHIP,
903,THE DYING WHIP,"And voices—why, Lor’ love you, it’s more than I can ’elp,"
904,THE DYING WHIP,It just comes kind of natural to know each whine an’ yelp;
905,THE DYING WHIP,"You might take them twenty couple where you will and let ’em run,"
906,THE DYING WHIP,An’ I’d listen by the coverside and name ’em one by one.
907,THE DYING WHIP,
908,THE DYING WHIP,"I say it’s kind of natural, for since I was a brat"
909,THE DYING WHIP,"I never cared for readin’ books, or fancy things like that;"
910,THE DYING WHIP,"But give me ’ounds and ’orses an’ I was quite content,"
911,THE DYING WHIP,An’ I loved to ear ’em talkin’ and to wonder what they meant.
912,THE DYING WHIP,
913,THE DYING WHIP,"And when the ’ydrophoby came five year ago next May,"
914,THE DYING WHIP,"When Nailer was be’avin’ in a most owdacious way,"
915,THE DYING WHIP,"I fixed ’im so’s ’e couldn’t bite, my ’ands on neck an’ back,"

917,THE DYING WHIP,
918,THE DYING WHIP,"An’ when the Master ’eard of it, ’e up an’ says, says ’e,"
919,THE DYING WHIP,"‘If that chap were a soldier man, they’d give ’im the V.C.’"
920,THE DYING WHIP,Which is some kind a’ medal what they give to soldier men;
921,THE DYING WHIP,An’ Master said if I were such I would ’a’ got it then.
922,THE DYING WHIP,
923,THE DYING WHIP,Parson brought ’is Bible and come to read to me;
924,THE DYING WHIP,"‘’Ave what you like, there’s everythink within this Book,’ says ’e."
925,THE DYING WHIP,"Says I, ‘They’ve left the ’orses out!’  Says ’e, ‘You are mistook;’"
926,THE DYING WHIP,An’ ’e up an’ read a ’eap of things about them from the Book.
927,THE DYING WHIP,
928,THE DYING WHIP,And some of it amazin’ fine; although I’m fit to swear
929,THE DYING WHIP,"No ’orse would ever say ‘Ah, ah!’ same as they said it there."
930,THE DYING WHIP,"Per’aps it was an ’Ebrew ’orse the chap ’ad in his mind,"
931,THE DYING WHIP,But I never ’eard an English ’orse say nothin’ of the kind.
932,THE DYING WHIP,
933,THE DYING WHIP,Parson is a good ’un.  I’ve known ’im from a lad;
934,THE DYING WHIP,"’Twas me as taught ’im ridin’, an’ ’e rides uncommon bad;"
935,THE DYING WHIP,And he says—But ’ark an’ listen!  There’s an ’orn!  I ’eard it blow;
936,THE DYING WHIP,"Pull the blind from off the winder!  Prop me up, and ’old me so."
937,THE DYING WHIP,
938,THE DYING WHIP,"They’re drawin’ the black ’anger, just aside the Squire’s grounds."
939,THE DYING WHIP,’Ark and listen!  ’Ark and listen!  There’s the yappin’ of the ’ounds:
940,THE DYING WHIP,"There’s Fanny and Beltinker, and I ’ear old Boxer call;"
941,THE DYING WHIP,You see I wasn’t boastin’ when I said I knew ’em all.
942,THE DYING WHIP,
943,THE DYING WHIP,Let me sit an’ ’old the bedrail!  Now I see ’em as they pass:
944,THE DYING WHIP,"There’s Squire upon the Midland mare, a good ’un on the grass;"
945,THE DYING WHIP,"But this is closish country, and you wants a clever ’orse"
946,THE DYING WHIP,When ’alf the time you’re in the woods an’ ’alf among the gorse.
947,THE DYING WHIP,
948,THE DYING WHIP,’Ark to Jack a’ollering—a-bleatin’ like a lamb.
949,THE DYING WHIP,"You wouldn’t think it now, perhaps, to see the thing I am;"
950,THE DYING WHIP,But there was a time the ladies used to linger at the meet
951,THE DYING WHIP,Just to ’ear me callin’ in the woods: my callin’ was so sweet.
952,THE DYING WHIP,
953,THE DYING WHIP,"I see the crossroads corner, with the field awaitin’ there,"
954,THE DYING WHIP,"There’s Purcell on ’is piebald ’orse, an’ Doctor on the mare,"
955,THE DYING WHIP,"And the Master on ’is iron grey; she isn’t much to look,"
956,THE DYING WHIP,But I seed ’er do clean twenty foot across the ’eathly brook.
957,THE DYING WHIP,
958,THE DYING WHIP,"There’s Captain Kane an’ McIntyre an’ ’alf a dozen more,"
959,THE DYING WHIP,And two or three are ’untin’ whom I never seed afore;
960,THE DYING WHIP,"Likely-lookin’ chaps they be, well groomed and ’orsed and dressed—"
961,THE DYING WHIP,I wish they could ’a seen the pack when it was at its best.
962,THE DYING WHIP,
963,THE DYING WHIP,"It’s a check, and they are drawin’ down the coppice for a scent,"
964,THE DYING WHIP,"You can see as they’ve been runnin’, for the ’orses they are spent;"
965,THE DYING WHIP,"I’ll lay the fox will break this way, downwind as sure as fate,"
966,THE DYING WHIP,An’ if he does you’ll see the field come poundin’ through our gate.
967,THE DYING WHIP,
968,THE DYING WHIP,"But, Maggie, what’s that slinkin’ beside the cover?—See!"
969,THE DYING WHIP,"Now it’s in the clover field, and goin’ fast an’ free,"
970,THE DYING WHIP,"It’s ’im, and they don’t see ’im.  It’s ’im!  ’Alloo!  ’Alloo!"
971,THE DYING WHIP,My broken wind won’t run to it—I’ll leave the job to you.
972,THE DYING WHIP,
973,THE DYING WHIP,"There now I ’ear the music, and I know they’re on his track;"
974,THE DYING WHIP,"Oh, watch ’em, Maggie, watch ’em!  Ain’t they just a lovely pack!"
975,THE DYING WHIP,"I’ve nursed ’em through distemper, an’ I’ve trained an’ broke ’em in,"
976,THE DYING WHIP,An’ my ’eart it just goes out to them as if they was my kin.
977,THE DYING WHIP,
978,THE DYING WHIP,"Well, all things ’as an endin’, as I’ve ’eard the parson say,"
979,THE DYING WHIP,"The ’orse is cast, an’ the ’ound is past, an’ the ’unter ’as ’is day;"
980,THE DYING WHIP,"But my day was yesterday, so lay me down again."
981,THE DYING WHIP,"You can draw the curtain, Maggie, right across the winder pane."

1081,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"And Sammy MacGregor on Flo,"
1082,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Jo Chauncy rode Spider, the rankest outsider,"
1083,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,But _he’d_ make a wooden horse go.
1084,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"There was Robin and Leah and Boadicea,"
1085,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,And Chesterfield’s Son of the Sea;
1086,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"And Irish Nuneaton, who never was beaten,"
1087,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,They backed her at seven to three.
1088,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1089,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"The course was the devil!  A start on the level,"
1090,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,And then a stiff breather uphill;
1091,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"A bank at the top with a four-foot drop,"
1092,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,And a bullfinch down by the mill.
1093,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"A stretch of straight from the Whittlesea gate,"
1094,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Then up and down and up;
1095,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,And the mounts that stay through Farnshire clay
1096,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,May bid for the Farnshire Cup.
1097,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1098,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"The tipsters were touting, the bookies were shouting"
1099,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"‘Bar one, bar one, bar one!’"
1100,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,With a glint and a glimmer of silken shimmer
1101,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"The field shone bright in the sun,"
1102,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,When Farmer Brown came riding down:
1103,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"‘I hain’t much time to spare,"
1104,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"But I’ve entered her name, so I’ll play out the game,"
1105,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,On the back o’ my old gray mare.
1106,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1107,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"‘You never would think ’er a thoroughbred clinker,"
1108,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,There’s never a judge that would;
1109,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Each leg be’ind ’as a splint, you’ll find,"
1110,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,And the fore are none too good.
1111,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"She roars a bit, and she don’t look fit,"
1112,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,She’s moulted ’alf ’er ’air;
1113,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"But—’  He smiled in a way that seemed to say,"
1114,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,That he knew that old gray mare.
1115,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1116,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"And the bookies laughed and the bookies chaffed,"
1117,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,‘Who backs the mare?’ cried they.
1118,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,‘A hundred to one!’  ‘It’s done—and done!’
1119,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,‘We’ll take that price all day.’
1120,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,‘What if the mare is shedding hair!
1121,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,What if her eye is wild!
1122,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,We read her worth and her pedigree birth
1123,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,In the smile that her owner smiled.’
1124,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1125,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,And the whisper grew and the whisper flew
1126,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,That she came of Isonomy stock.
1127,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,‘Fifty to one!’  ‘It’s done—and done!
1128,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Look at her haunch and hock!
1129,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Ill-groomed!  Why yes, but one may guess"
1130,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,That that is her owner’s guile.’
1131,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Ah, Farmer Brown, the sharps from town,"
1132,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Have read your simple smile!
1133,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1134,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"They’ve weighed him in.  ‘Now lose or win,"
1135,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,I’ve money at stake this day;
1136,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Gee-long, my sweet, and if we’re beat,"
1137,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,We’ll both do all we may!’
1138,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"He joins the rest, they line abreast,"
1139,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,‘Back Leah!  Mavis up!’
1140,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"The flag is dipped and the field is slipped,"
1141,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Full split for the Farnshire Cup.
1142,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1143,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Christopher Davis is leading on Mavis,"
1144,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Spider is waiting on Flo;
1145,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Boadicea is gaining on Leah,"
1146,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Irish Nuneaton lies low;
1147,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Robin is tailing, his wind has been failing,"
1148,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Son of the Sea’s going fast:
1149,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"So crack on the pace for it’s anyone’s race,"
1150,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,And the winner’s the horse that can last.
1151,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1152,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Chestnut and bay, and sorrel and gray,"
1153,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,See how they glimmer and gleam!
1154,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Bending and straining, and losing and gaining,"
1155,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Silk jackets flutter and stream;
1156,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"They are over the grass as the cloud shadows pass,"
1157,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,They are up to the fence at the top;
1158,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"It’s ‘hey then!’ and over, and into the clover,"
1159,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,There wasn’t one slip at the drop.
1160,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1161,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"They are all going still; they are round by the mill,"
1162,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,They are down by the Whittlesea gate;
1163,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Leah’s complaining, and Mavis is gaining,"
1164,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,And Flo’s catching up in the straight.
1165,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Robin’s gone wrong, but the Spider runs strong,"
1166,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,He sticks to the leader like wax;
1167,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"An utter outsider, but look at his rider—"
1168,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Jo Chauncy, the pick of the cracks!"
1169,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1170,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Robin was tailing and pecked at a paling,"
1171,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Leah’s gone weak in her feet;
1172,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Boadicea came down at the railing,"
1173,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Son of the Sea is dead beat.
1174,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Leather to leather, they’re pounding together,"
1175,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Three of them all in a row;
1176,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"And Irish Nuneaton, who never was beaten,"
1177,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Is level with Spider and Flo.
1178,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1179,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"It’s into the straight from the Whittlesea gate,"
1180,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Clean galloping over the green,"
1181,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,But four foot high the hurdles lie
1182,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,With a sunken ditch between.
1183,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"’Tis a bit of a test for a beast at its best,"
1184,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,And the devil and all at its worst;
1185,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,But it’s clear run in with the Cup to win
1186,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,For the horse that is over it first.
1187,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1188,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"So try it, my beauties, and fly it, my beauties,"
1189,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Spider, Nuneaton, and Flo;"
1190,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"With a trip and a blunder there’s one of them under,"
1191,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Hark to it crashing below!
1192,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Is it the brown or the sorrel that’s down?
1193,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,The brown!  It is Flo who is in!
1194,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"And Spider with Chauncy, the pick of the fancy,"
1195,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Is going full split for a win.
1196,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1197,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,‘Spider is winning!’  ‘Jo Chauncy is winning!’
1198,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,‘He’s winning!  He’s winning!  Bravo!’
1199,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"The bookies are raving, the ladies are waving,"
1200,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,The Stand is all shouting for Jo.
1201,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"The horse is clean done, but the race may be won"
1202,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,By the Newmarket lad on his back;
1203,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,For the fire of the rider may bring an outsider
1204,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Ahead of a thoroughbred crack.
1205,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1206,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,‘Spider is winning!’  ‘Jo Chauncy is winning!’
1207,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,It swells like the roar of the sea;
1208,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"But Jo hears the drumming of somebody coming,"
1209,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,And sees a lean head by his knee.
1210,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,‘Nuneaton!  Nuneaton!  The Spider is beaten!’
1211,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,It is but a spurt at the most;
1212,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"For lose it or win it, they have but a minute"
1213,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Before they are up with the post.
1214,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1215,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Nuneaton is straining, Nuneaton is gaining,"
1216,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Neither will falter nor flinch;
1217,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Whips they are plying and jackets are flying,"
1218,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,They’re fairly abreast to an inch.
1219,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,‘Crack ’em up!  Let ’em go!  Well ridden!  Bravo!’
1220,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Gamer ones never were bred;
1221,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Jo Chauncy has done it!  He’s spurted!  He’s won it!’
1222,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,The favourite’s beat by a head!
1223,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1224,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"Don’t tell me of luck, for its judgment and pluck"
1225,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,And a courage that never will shirk;
1226,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,To give your mind to it and know how to do it
1227,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,And put all your heart in your work.
1228,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"So here’s to the Spider, the winning outsider,"
1229,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,With little Jo Chauncy up;
1230,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"May they stay life’s course, both jockey and horse,"
1231,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,As they stayed in the Farnshire Cup.
1232,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1233,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,But it’s possible that you are wondering what
1234,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"May have happened to Farmer Brown,"
1235,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,And the old gray crock of Isonomy stock
1236,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Who was backed by the sharps from town.
1237,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"She blew and she sneezed, she coughed and she wheezed,"
1238,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,She ran till her knees gave way.
1239,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,But never a grumble at trip or at stumble
1240,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,Was heard from her jock that day.
1241,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,
1242,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"For somebody laid _against_ the gray,"
1243,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,And somebody made a pile;
1244,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"And Brown says he can make farming pay,"
1245,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,And he smiles a simple smile.
1246,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"‘Them sharps from town were riled,’ says Brown;"
1247,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,‘But I can’t see why—can you?
1248,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,"For I said quite fair as I knew that mare,"
1249,THE FARNSHIRE CUP,And I proved my words was true.’

1257,THE GROOM’S STORY,"Ten mile in twenty minutes!  ’E done it, sir.  That’s true."
1258,THE GROOM’S STORY,The big bay ’orse in the further stall—the one wot’s next to you.
1259,THE GROOM’S STORY,"I’ve seen some better ’orses; I’ve seldom seen a wuss,"
1260,THE GROOM’S STORY,"But ’e ’olds the bloomin’ record, an’ that’s good enough for us."
1261,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1262,THE GROOM’S STORY,"We knew as it wa’s in ’im.  ’E’s thoroughbred, three part,"
1263,THE GROOM’S STORY,"We bought ’im for to race ’im, but we found ’e ’ad no ’eart;"
1264,THE GROOM’S STORY,"For ’e was sad and thoughtful, and amazin’ dignified,"
1265,THE GROOM’S STORY,It seemed a kind o’ liberty to drive ’im or to ride;
1266,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1267,THE GROOM’S STORY,"For ’e never seemed a-thinkin’ of what ’e ’ad to do,"
1268,THE GROOM’S STORY,"But ’is thoughts was set on ’igher things, admirin’ of the view."
1269,THE GROOM’S STORY,"’E looked a puffeck pictur, and a pictur ’e would stay,"
1270,THE GROOM’S STORY,’E wouldn’t even switch ’is tail to drive the flies away.
1271,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1272,THE GROOM’S STORY,"And yet we knew ’twas in ’im, we knew as ’e could fly;"
1273,THE GROOM’S STORY,But what we couldn’t git at was ’ow to make ’im try.
1274,THE GROOM’S STORY,"We’d almost turned the job up, until at last one day"
1275,THE GROOM’S STORY,We got the last yard out of ’im in a most amazin’ way.
1276,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1277,THE GROOM’S STORY,It was all along o’ master; which master ’as the name
1278,THE GROOM’S STORY,"Of a reg’lar true blue sportman, an’ always acts the same;"
1279,THE GROOM’S STORY,"But we all ’as weaker moments, which master ’e ’ad one,"
1280,THE GROOM’S STORY,An’ ’e went and bought a motor-car when motor-cars begun.
1281,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1282,THE GROOM’S STORY,I seed it in the stable yard—it fairly turned me sick—
1283,THE GROOM’S STORY,"A greasy, wheezy engine as can neither buck nor kick."
1284,THE GROOM’S STORY,"You’ve a screw to drive it forrard, and a screw to make it stop,"
1285,THE GROOM’S STORY,For it was foaled in a smithy stove an’ bred in a blacksmith shop.
1286,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1287,THE GROOM’S STORY,"It didn’t want no stable, it didn’t ask no groom,"
1288,THE GROOM’S STORY,It didn’t need no nothin’ but a bit o’ standin’ room.
1289,THE GROOM’S STORY,"Just fill it up with paraffin an’ it would go all day,"
1290,THE GROOM’S STORY,Which the same should be agin the law if I could ’ave my way.
1291,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1292,THE GROOM’S STORY,"Well, master took ’is motor-car, an’ moted ’ere an’ there,"
1293,THE GROOM’S STORY,A frightenin’ the ’orses an’ a poisonin’ the air.
1294,THE GROOM’S STORY,"’E wore a bloomin’ yachtin’ cap, but Lor’! wot _did_ ’e know,"
1295,THE GROOM’S STORY,Excep’ that if you turn a screw the thing would stop or go?
1296,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1297,THE GROOM’S STORY,"An’ then one day it wouldn’t go.  ’E screwed and screwed again,"
1298,THE GROOM’S STORY,"But somethin’ jammed, an’ there ’e stuck in the mud of a country lane."
1299,THE GROOM’S STORY,"It ’urt ’is pride most cruel, but what was ’e to do?"
1300,THE GROOM’S STORY,So at last ’e bade me fetch a ’orse to pull the motor through.
1301,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1302,THE GROOM’S STORY,"This was the ’orse we fetched ’im; an’ when we reached the car,"
1303,THE GROOM’S STORY,"We braced ’im tight and proper to the middle of the bar,"
1304,THE GROOM’S STORY,"And buckled up ’is traces and lashed them to each side,"
1305,THE GROOM’S STORY,"While ’e ’eld ’is ’ead so ’aughtily, an’ looked most dignified."
1306,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1307,THE GROOM’S STORY,"Not bad tempered, mind you, but kind of pained and vexed,"
1308,THE GROOM’S STORY,"And ’e seemed to say, ‘Well, bli’ me! wot _will_ they ask me next?"
1309,THE GROOM’S STORY,"I’ve put up with some liberties, but this caps all by far,"
1310,THE GROOM’S STORY,To be assistant engine to a crocky motor-car!’
1311,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1312,THE GROOM’S STORY,"Well, master ’e was in the car, a-fiddlin’ with the gear,"
1313,THE GROOM’S STORY,"And the ’orse was meditatin’, an’ I was standin’ near,"
1314,THE GROOM’S STORY,When master ’e touched somethin’—what it was we’ll never know—
1315,THE GROOM’S STORY,But it sort o’ spurred the boiler up and made the engine go.
1316,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1317,THE GROOM’S STORY,"‘’Old ’ard, old gal!’ says master, and ‘Gently then!’ says I,"
1318,THE GROOM’S STORY,But an engine won’t ’eed coaxin’ an’ it ain’t no use to try;
1319,THE GROOM’S STORY,"So first ’e pulled a lever, an’ then ’e turned a screw,"
1320,THE GROOM’S STORY,But the thing kept crawlin’ forrard spite of all that ’e could do.
1321,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1322,THE GROOM’S STORY,"And first it went quite slowly and the ’orse went also slow,"
1323,THE GROOM’S STORY,But ’e ’ad to buck up faster when the wheels began to go;
1324,THE GROOM’S STORY,"For the car kept crowdin’ on ’im and buttin’ ’im along,"
1325,THE GROOM’S STORY,"And in less than ’alf a minute, sir, that ’orse was goin’ strong."
1326,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1327,THE GROOM’S STORY,"At first ’e walked quite dignified, an’ then ’e ’ad to trot,"
1328,THE GROOM’S STORY,And then ’e tried a canter when the pace became too ’ot.
1329,THE GROOM’S STORY,"’E looked ’is very ’aughtiest, as if ’e didn’t ’e mind,"
1330,THE GROOM’S STORY,And all the time the motor-car was pushin’ ’im be’ind.
1331,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1332,THE GROOM’S STORY,"Now, master lost ’is ’ead when ’e found ’e couldn’t stop,"
1333,THE GROOM’S STORY,"And ’e pulled a valve or somethin’ an’ somethin’ else went pop,"
1334,THE GROOM’S STORY,"An’ somethin’ else went fizzywiz, and in a flash, or less,"
1335,THE GROOM’S STORY,That blessed car was goin’ like a limited express.
1336,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1337,THE GROOM’S STORY,"Master ’eld the steerin’ gear, an’ kept the road all right,"
1338,THE GROOM’S STORY,And away they whizzed and clattered—my aunt! it was a sight.
1339,THE GROOM’S STORY,"’E seemed the finest draught ’orse as ever lived by far,"
1340,THE GROOM’S STORY,For all the country Juggins thought ’twas ’im wot pulled the car.
1341,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1342,THE GROOM’S STORY,"’E was stretchin’ like a grey’ound, ’e was goin’ all ’e knew;"
1343,THE GROOM’S STORY,"But it bumped an’ shoved be’ind ’im, for all that ’e could do;"
1344,THE GROOM’S STORY,"It butted ’im an’ boosted ’im an’ spanked ’im on a’ead,"
1345,THE GROOM’S STORY,"Till ’e broke the ten-mile record, same as I already said."
1346,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1347,THE GROOM’S STORY,"Ten mile in twenty minutes!  ’E done it, sir.  That’s true."
1348,THE GROOM’S STORY,The only time we ever found what that ’ere ’orse could do.
1349,THE GROOM’S STORY,"Some say it wasn’t ’ardly fair, and the papers made a fuss,"
1350,THE GROOM’S STORY,"But ’e broke the ten-mile record, and that’s good enough for us."
1351,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1352,THE GROOM’S STORY,"You see that ’orse’s tail, sir?  You don’t!  No more do we,"
1353,THE GROOM’S STORY,"Which really ain’t surprisin’, for ’e ’as no tail to see;"
1354,THE GROOM’S STORY,"That engine wore it off ’im before master made it stop,"
1355,THE GROOM’S STORY,And all the road was littered like a bloomin’ barber’s shop.
1356,THE GROOM’S STORY,
1357,THE GROOM’S STORY,"And master?  Well, it cured ’im.  ’E altered from that day,"
1358,THE GROOM’S STORY,And come back to ’is ’orses in the good old-fashioned way.
1359,THE GROOM’S STORY,"And if you wants to git the sack, the quickest way by far"
1360,THE GROOM’S STORY,Is to ’int as ’ow you think ’e ought to keep a motor-car.

1821,THE BLIND ARCHER,"Little boy Love drew his bow at a chance,"
1822,THE BLIND ARCHER,Shooting down at the ballroom floor;
1823,THE BLIND ARCHER,"He hit an old chaperone watching the dance,"
1824,THE BLIND ARCHER,And oh! but he wounded her sore.
1825,THE BLIND ARCHER,"‘Hey, Love, you couldn’t mean that!"
1826,THE BLIND ARCHER,"Hi, Love, what would you be at?’"
1827,THE BLIND ARCHER,"No word would he say,"
1828,THE BLIND ARCHER,"But he flew on his way,"
1829,THE BLIND ARCHER,"For the little boy’s busy, and how could he stay?"
1830,THE BLIND ARCHER,
1831,THE BLIND ARCHER,Little boy Love drew a shaft just for sport
1832,THE BLIND ARCHER,At the soberest club in Pall Mall;
1833,THE BLIND ARCHER,"He winged an old veteran drinking his port,"
1834,THE BLIND ARCHER,And down that old veteran fell.
1835,THE BLIND ARCHER,"‘Hey, Love, you mustn’t do that!"
1836,THE BLIND ARCHER,"Hi, Love, what would you be at?"
1837,THE BLIND ARCHER,This cannot be right!
1838,THE BLIND ARCHER,It’s ludicrous quite!’
1839,THE BLIND ARCHER,"But it’s no use to argue, for Love’s out of sight."
1840,THE BLIND ARCHER,
1841,THE BLIND ARCHER,A sad-faced young clerk in a cell all apart
1842,THE BLIND ARCHER,Was planning a celibate vow;
1843,THE BLIND ARCHER,"But the boy’s random arrow has sunk in his heart,"
1844,THE BLIND ARCHER,And the cell is an empty one now.
1845,THE BLIND ARCHER,"‘Hey, Love, you mustn’t do that!"
1846,THE BLIND ARCHER,"Hi, Love, what would you be at?"
1847,THE BLIND ARCHER,"He is not for you,"
1848,THE BLIND ARCHER,He has duties to do.’
1849,THE BLIND ARCHER,"‘But I _am_ his duty,’ quoth Love as he flew."
1850,THE BLIND ARCHER,
1851,THE BLIND ARCHER,"The king sought a bride, and the nation had hoped"
1852,THE BLIND ARCHER,For a queen without rival or peer.
1853,THE BLIND ARCHER,"But the little boy shot, and the king has eloped"
1854,THE BLIND ARCHER,With Miss No-one on Nothing a year.
1855,THE BLIND ARCHER,"‘Hey, Love, you couldn’t mean that!"
1856,THE BLIND ARCHER,"Hi, Love, what would you be at?"
1857,THE BLIND ARCHER,What an impudent thing
1858,THE BLIND ARCHER,To make game of a king!’
1859,THE BLIND ARCHER,"‘But _I’m_ a king also,’ cried Love on the wing."
1860,THE BLIND ARCHER,
1861,THE BLIND ARCHER,Little boy Love grew pettish one day;
1862,THE BLIND ARCHER,"‘If you keep on complaining,’ he swore,"
1863,THE BLIND ARCHER,"‘I’ll pack both my bow and my quiver away,"

1865,THE BLIND ARCHER,"‘Hey, Love, you mustn’t do that!"
1866,THE BLIND ARCHER,"Hi, Love, what would you be at?"
1867,THE BLIND ARCHER,"You may ruin our ease,"

1922,THE PASSING,"It was the hour of dawn,"
1923,THE PASSING,"When the heart beats thin and small,"
1924,THE PASSING,"The window glimmered grey,"
1925,THE PASSING,Framed in a shadow wall.
1926,THE PASSING,
1927,THE PASSING,And in the cold sad light
1928,THE PASSING,"Of the early morningtide,"
1929,THE PASSING,The dear dead girl came back
1930,THE PASSING,And stood by his bedside.
1931,THE PASSING,
1932,THE PASSING,The girl he lost came back:
1933,THE PASSING,He saw her flowing hair;
1934,THE PASSING,It flickered and it waved
1935,THE PASSING,Like a breath in frosty air.
1936,THE PASSING,
1937,THE PASSING,"As in a steamy glass,"
1938,THE PASSING,Her face was dim and blurred;
1939,THE PASSING,"Her voice was sweet and thin,"
1940,THE PASSING,Like the calling of a bird.
1941,THE PASSING,
1942,THE PASSING,"‘You said that you would come,"
1943,THE PASSING,You promised not to stay;
1944,THE PASSING,"And I have waited here,"
1945,THE PASSING,To help you on the way.
1946,THE PASSING,
1947,THE PASSING,"‘I have waited on,"
1948,THE PASSING,But still you bide below;
1949,THE PASSING,"You said that you would come,"
1950,THE PASSING,"And oh, I want you so!"
1951,THE PASSING,
1952,THE PASSING,"‘For half my soul is here,"

1956,THE PASSING,
1957,THE PASSING,‘But on your dressing-stand

1959,THE PASSING,Unlock the little gate
1960,THE PASSING,Which fences you from me.
1961,THE PASSING,
1962,THE PASSING,"‘Just one little pang,"
1963,THE PASSING,"Just one throb of pain,"
1964,THE PASSING,And then your weary head
1965,THE PASSING,Between my breasts again.’
1966,THE PASSING,
1967,THE PASSING,In the dim unhomely light
1968,THE PASSING,"Of the early morningtide,"
1969,THE PASSING,He took the triple key
1970,THE PASSING,And he laid it by his side.
1971,THE PASSING,
1972,THE PASSING,"A pistol, silver chased,"
1973,THE PASSING,"An open hunting knife,"
1974,THE PASSING,A phial of the drug
1975,THE PASSING,Which cures the ill of life.
1976,THE PASSING,
1977,THE PASSING,"He looked upon the three,"
1978,THE PASSING,And sharply drew his breath:
1979,THE PASSING,"‘Now help me, oh my love,"
1980,THE PASSING,For I fear this cold grey death.’
1981,THE PASSING,
1982,THE PASSING,"She bent her face above,"
1983,THE PASSING,She kissed him and she smiled;
1984,THE PASSING,She soothed him as a mother
1985,THE PASSING,May sooth a frightened child.
1986,THE PASSING,
1987,THE PASSING,"‘Just that little pang, love,"
1988,THE PASSING,"Just a throb of pain,"
1989,THE PASSING,And then your weary head
1990,THE PASSING,Between my breasts again.’
1991,THE PASSING,
1992,THE PASSING,"He snatched the pistol up,"
1993,THE PASSING,He pressed it to his ear;
1994,THE PASSING,"But a sudden sound broke in,"
1995,THE PASSING,And his skin was raw with fear.
1996,THE PASSING,
1997,THE PASSING,"He took the hunting knife,"
1998,THE PASSING,He tried to raise the blade;
1999,THE PASSING,"It glimmered cold and white,"
2000,THE PASSING,And he was sore afraid.
2001,THE PASSING,
2002,THE PASSING,"He poured the potion out,"
2003,THE PASSING,But it was thick and brown;
2004,THE PASSING,"His throat was sealed against it,"
2005,THE PASSING,And he could not drain it down.
2006,THE PASSING,
2007,THE PASSING,"He looked to her for help,"
2008,THE PASSING,And when he looked—behold!
2009,THE PASSING,His love was there before him
2010,THE PASSING,As in the days of old.
2011,THE PASSING,
2012,THE PASSING,"He saw the drooping head,"
2013,THE PASSING,He saw the gentle eyes;
2014,THE PASSING,He saw the same shy grace of hers
2015,THE PASSING,He had been wont to prize.
2016,THE PASSING,
2017,THE PASSING,"She pointed and she smiled,"
2018,THE PASSING,And lo! he was aware
2019,THE PASSING,Of a half-lit bedroom chamber
2020,THE PASSING,And a silent figure there.
2021,THE PASSING,
2022,THE PASSING,A silent figure lying
2023,THE PASSING,"A-sprawl upon a bed,"
2024,THE PASSING,With a silver-mounted pistol
2025,THE PASSING,Still clotted to his head.
2026,THE PASSING,
2027,THE PASSING,"And as he downward gazed,"
2028,THE PASSING,"Her voice came full and clear,"
2029,THE PASSING,The homely tender voice
2030,THE PASSING,Which he had loved to hear:
2031,THE PASSING,
2032,THE PASSING,"‘The key is very certain,"
2033,THE PASSING,The door is sealed to none.
2034,THE PASSING,"You did it, oh, my darling!"
2035,THE PASSING,And you never knew it done.
2036,THE PASSING,
2037,THE PASSING,"‘When the net was broken,"
2038,THE PASSING,You thought you felt its mesh;
2039,THE PASSING,You carried to the spirit
2040,THE PASSING,The troubles of the flesh.
2041,THE PASSING,
2042,THE PASSING,"‘And are you trembling still, dear?"
2043,THE PASSING,Then let me take your hand;
2044,THE PASSING,And I will lead you outward
2045,THE PASSING,To a sweet and restful land.
2046,THE PASSING,
2047,THE PASSING,‘You know how once in London
2048,THE PASSING,I put my griefs on you;
2049,THE PASSING,But I can carry yours now—
2050,THE PASSING,Most sweet it is to do!
2051,THE PASSING,
2052,THE PASSING,"‘Most sweet it is to do, love,"
2053,THE PASSING,And very sweet to plan
2054,THE PASSING,"How I, the helpless woman,"
2055,THE PASSING,Can help the helpful man.
2056,THE PASSING,
2057,THE PASSING,‘But let me see you smiling
2058,THE PASSING,With the smile I know so well;
2059,THE PASSING,"Forget the world of shadows,"
2060,THE PASSING,And the empty broken shell.
2061,THE PASSING,
2062,THE PASSING,‘It is the worn-out garment
2063,THE PASSING,In which you tore a rent;
2064,THE PASSING,"You tossed it down, and carelessly"
2065,THE PASSING,Upon your way you went.
2066,THE PASSING,
2067,THE PASSING,"‘It is not _you_, my sweetheart,"
2068,THE PASSING,For you are here with me.
2069,THE PASSING,That frame was but the promise of
2070,THE PASSING,The thing that was to be—
2071,THE PASSING,
2072,THE PASSING,‘A tuning of the choir
2073,THE PASSING,Ere the harmonies begin;
2074,THE PASSING,And yet it is the image
2075,THE PASSING,Of the subtle thing within.
2076,THE PASSING,
2077,THE PASSING,"‘There’s not a trick of body,"
2078,THE PASSING,"There’s not a trait of mind,"
2079,THE PASSING,"But you bring it over with you,"
2080,THE PASSING,"Ethereal, refined,"
2081,THE PASSING,
2082,THE PASSING,‘But still the same; for surely
2083,THE PASSING,"If we alter as we die,"
2084,THE PASSING,"You would be you no longer,"
2085,THE PASSING,And I would not be I.
2086,THE PASSING,
2087,THE PASSING,"‘I might be an angel,"
2088,THE PASSING,But not the girl you knew;
2089,THE PASSING,"You might be immaculate,"
2090,THE PASSING,But that would not be you.
2091,THE PASSING,
2092,THE PASSING,"‘And now I see you smiling,"
2093,THE PASSING,"So, darling, take my hand;"
2094,THE PASSING,And I will lead you outward
2095,THE PASSING,"To a sweet and pleasant land,"
2096,THE PASSING,
2097,THE PASSING,"‘Where thought is clear and nimble,"
2098,THE PASSING,"Where life is pure and fresh,"
2099,THE PASSING,Where the soul comes back rejoicing
2100,THE PASSING,From the mud-bath of the flesh
2101,THE PASSING,
2102,THE PASSING,"‘But still that soul is human,"
2103,THE PASSING,"With human ways, and so"
2104,THE PASSING,"I love my love in spirit,"
2105,THE PASSING,As I loved him long ago.’
2106,THE PASSING,
2107,THE PASSING,So with hands together
2108,THE PASSING,"And fingers twining tight,"
2109,THE PASSING,The two dead lovers drifted
2110,THE PASSING,In the golden morning light.
2111,THE PASSING,
2112,THE PASSING,But a grey-haired man was lying
2113,THE PASSING,"Beneath them on a bed,"

2115,THE PASSING,Still clotted to his head.

2160,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,There’s a keen and grim old huntsman
2161,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,On a horse as white as snow;
2162,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,Sometimes he is very swift
2163,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,And sometimes he is slow.
2164,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,"But he never is at fault,"
2165,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,For he always hunts at view
2166,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,And he rides without a halt
2167,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,After you.
2168,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,
2169,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,"The huntsman’s name is Death,"
2170,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,His horse’s name is Time;
2171,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,"He is coming, he is coming"
2172,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,As I sit and write this rhyme;
2173,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,"He is coming, he is coming,"
2174,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,As you read the rhyme I write;
2175,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,You can hear the hoofs’ low drumming
2176,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,Day and night.
2177,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,
2178,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,You can hear the distant drumming
2179,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,"As the clock goes tick-a-tack,"
2180,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,And the chiming of the hours
2181,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,Is the music of his pack.
2182,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,You may hardly note their growling
2183,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,"Underneath the noonday sun,"
2184,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,But at night you hear them howling
2185,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,As they run.
2186,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,
2187,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,And they never check or falter
2188,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,For they never miss their kill;
2189,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,"Seasons change and systems alter,"
2190,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,But the hunt is running still.
2191,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,"Hark! the evening chime is playing,"
2192,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,O’er the long grey town it peals;
2193,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,Don’t you hear the death-hound baying
2194,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,At your heels?
2195,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,
2196,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,Where is there an earth or burrow?
2197,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,Where a cover left for you?
2198,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,"A year, a week, perhaps to-morrow"
2199,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,Brings the Huntsman’s death halloo!
2200,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,"Day by day he gains upon us,"
2201,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,And the most that we can claim
2202,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,Is that when the hounds are on us
2203,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,We die game.
2204,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,
2205,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,"And somewhere dwells the Master,"
2206,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,By whom it was decreed;
2207,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,"He sent the savage huntsman,"
2208,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,He bred the snow-white steed.
2209,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,"These hounds which run for ever,"
2210,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,He set them on your track;
2211,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,"He hears you scream, but never"
2212,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,Calls them back.
2213,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,
2214,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,"He does not heed our suing,"
2215,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,We never see his face;
2216,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,"He hunts to our undoing,"
2217,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,We thank him for the chase.
2218,THE OLD HUNTSMAN,"We thank him and we flatter,"
