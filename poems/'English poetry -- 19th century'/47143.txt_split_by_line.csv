753,WORDSWORTH'S POETICAL WORKS,"in the British Parliament and elsewhere, in 1821, on the subject of"

759,WORDSWORTH'S POETICAL WORKS,the Lives of Eminent Men connected with the History of Religion in

763,WORDSWORTH'S POETICAL WORKS,own work was far advanced before he was aware that Southey had taken up
764,WORDSWORTH'S POETICAL WORKS,"the subject. As several of the Sonnets, however, are well illustrated"

798,IN SERIES,were written long before ecclesiastical history and points of doctrine
799,IN SERIES,had excited the interest with which they have been recently enquired
800,IN SERIES,into and discussed. The former particular is mentioned as an excuse for
801,IN SERIES,my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been
802,IN SERIES,selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the Popedom
803,IN SERIES,"over temporal sovereignty had attained, and the arrogance with which it"
804,IN SERIES,"was displayed. I allude to the last Sonnet but one in the first series,"
805,IN SERIES,where Pope Alexander the Third at Venice is described as setting his
806,IN SERIES,foot on the neck of the Emperor Barbarossa. Though this is related
807,IN SERIES,"as a fact in history, I am told it is a mere legend of no authority."

815,IN SERIES,is not in the least changed. Omitting here to examine into his conduct
816,IN SERIES,"in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged, I"
817,IN SERIES,am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which
818,IN SERIES,"had been abandoned were good and wise, whatever errors he might commit"
819,IN SERIES,in the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them. I further believe
820,IN SERIES,"that, had not he, and others who shared his opinions and felt as he"

7533,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"Trajan's Column was set up by the Senate and people of Rome, in honour"
7534,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"of the Emperor, about A.D. 114. It is one of the most remarkable"
7535,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"pillars in the world; and still stands, little injured by time, in"
7536,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,the centre of the _Forum Trajanum_ (now a ruin); its height--132
7537,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,feet--marking the height of the earth removed when the Forum was made.
7538,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,On the pedestal bas-reliefs were carved in series showing the arms
7539,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,and armour of the Romans; and round the shaft of the column similar
7540,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"reliefs, exhibiting pictorially the whole story of the Decian campaign"
7541,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,of the Emperor. These are of great value as illustrating the history
7542,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"of the period, the costume of the Roman soldiers and the barbarians. A"
7543,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"colossal statue of Trajan crowned the column; and, when it fell, Pope"
7544,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,Sixtus V. replaced it by a figure of St. Peter. It is referred to by
7545,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"Pausanias (v. 12. 6), and by all the ancient topographers. See a minute"
7546,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"account of it, with excellent illustrations, in Hertzberg's _Geschichte"
7547,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"des Römischen Kaiserreiches_, pp. 330-345 (Berlin: 1880); also"
7548,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"Müller's _Denkmäler der alten Kunst_, p. 51. The book, however, from"
7549,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,which Wordsworth gained his information of this pillar was evidently
7550,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"Joseph Forsyth's _Remarks on Antiquities, Arts, and Letters, during"
7551,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,an Excursion in Italy in 1802-3_ (London: 1813). It is thus that Dean
7552,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,Merivale speaks of it:--
7553,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,
7554,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"""Amid this profusion of splendour"" (_i.e._ in the _Forum Trajanum_)"
7555,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"""the great object to which the eye was principally directed was the"
7556,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"column, which rose majestically in the centre of the forum to the"
7557,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"height of 126 feet, sculptured from the base of the shaft to the"
7558,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"summit with the story of the Decian wars, shining in every volute and"
7559,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"moulding, with gold and pigments, and crowned with the colossal effigy"
7560,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,of the august conqueror.... The proportions of the Trajan column are
7561,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"peculiarly graceful; the compact masses of stone, nineteen in number,"
7562,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"of which the whole shaft is composed, may lead us to admire the skill"
7563,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,employed in its construction; but the most interesting feature of
7564,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,this historic monument is the spiral band of figures which throughout
7565,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"enriches it. To the subjects of Trajan himself, this record of his"
7566,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,exploits in bold relief must have given a vivid and sufficient idea of
7567,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"the people, the places, and the actions indicated; even to us, after"
7568,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"so many centuries, they furnish a correct type of the arms, the arts,"
7569,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,and the costume both of the Romans and barbarians which we should
7570,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,vainly seek for elsewhere. The Trajan column forms a notable chapter

7572,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"Empire_, vol. viii. pp. 46, 47.)"
7573,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,
7574,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"In the Fenwick note, Wordsworth mentions that, what gave rise to this"
7575,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,"poem was, his observing in the newspapers that ""the Pillar of Trajan"""
7576,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,was prescribed as a subject for a prize poem at Oxford. This determines
7577,THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN,the date of composition. _The Pillar of Trajan_ was the Newdigate prize

13677,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",Sir Walter Scott before his departure for Italy. This journey had been
13678,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",delayed by an inflammation in my eyes till we found that the time
13679,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",appointed for his leaving home would be too near for him to receive
13680,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",us without considerable inconvenience. Nevertheless we proceeded and
13681,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",reached Abbotsford on Monday. I was then scarcely able to lift up my
13682,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",eyes to the light. How sadly changed did I find him from the man I
13683,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","had seen so healthy, gay, and hopeful, a few years before, when he"
13684,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","said at the inn at Paterdale, in my presence, his daughter Anne also"
13685,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","being there, with Mr. Lockhart, my own wife and daughter, and Mr."

13687,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","long as I live."" But to return to Abbotsford: the inmates and guests we"
13688,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","found there were Sir Walter, Major Scott, Anne Scott, and Mr. and Mrs."
13689,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","Lockhart, Mr. Liddell, his Lady and Brother, and Mr. Allan the painter,"
13690,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","and Mr. Laidlaw, a very old friend of Sir Walter's. One of Burns's"
13691,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","sons, an officer in the Indian service, had left the house a day or two"
13692,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","before, and had kindly expressed his regret that he could not wait my"
13693,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","arrival, a regret that I may truly say was mutual. In the evening, Mr."
13694,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","and Mrs. Liddell sang, and Mrs. Lockhart chanted old ballads to her"
13695,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","harp; and Mr. Allan, hanging over the back of a chair, told and acted"
13696,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",old stories in a humorous way. With this exhibition and his daughter's
13697,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","singing, Sir Walter was much amused, as indeed were we all as far as"
13698,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",circumstances would allow. But what is most worthy of mention is the
13699,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",admirable demeanour of Major Scott during the following evening when
13700,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",the Liddells were gone and only ourselves and Mr. Allan were present.
13701,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",He had much to suffer from the sight of his father's infirmities and
13702,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",from the great change that was about to take place at the residence
13703,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","he had built, and where he had long lived in so much prosperity and"
13704,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",happiness. But what struck me most was the patient kindness with which
13705,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",he supported himself under the many fretful expressions that his sister
13706,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","Anne addressed to him or uttered in his hearing. She, poor thing, as"
13707,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","mistress of that house, had been subject, after her mother's death, to"
13708,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",a heavier load of care and responsibility and greater sacrifices of
13709,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",time than one of such a constitution of body and mind was able to bear.
13710,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","Of this, Dora and I were made so sensible, that, as soon as we had"
13711,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","crossed the Tweed on our departure, we gave vent at the same moment to"
13712,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",our apprehensions that her brain would fail and she would go out of her
13713,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","mind, or that she would sink under the trials she had passed and those"
13714,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",which awaited her. On Tuesday morning Sir Walter Scott accompanied us
13715,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",and most of the party to Newark Castle on the Yarrow. When we alighted
13716,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","from the carriages he walked pretty stoutly, and had great pleasure in"
13717,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",revisiting those his favourite haunts. Of that excursion the verses
13718,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",_Yarrow Revisited_ are a memorial. Notwithstanding the romance that
13719,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","pervades Sir Walter's works and attaches to many of his habits, there"
13720,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",is too much pressure of fact for these verses to harmonise as much as
13721,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",I could wish with other poems. On our return in the afternoon we had
13722,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",to cross the Tweed directly opposite Abbotsford. The wheels of our
13723,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",carriage grated upon the pebbles in the bed of the stream that there
13724,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",flows somewhat rapidly: a rich but sad light of rather a purple than
13725,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","a golden hue was spread over the Eildon Hills at that moment; and,"
13726,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",thinking it probable that it might be the last time Sir Walter would
13727,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","cross the stream, I was not a little moved, and expressed some of my"
13728,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","feelings in the Sonnet beginning--""A trouble, not of clouds, or weeping"
13729,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","rain."" At noon on Thursday we left Abbotsford, and in the morning of"
13730,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","that day Sir Walter and I had a serious conversation _tête-à-tête_,"
13731,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",when he spoke with gratitude of the happy life which upon the whole he
13732,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","had led. He had written in my daughter's Album, before he came into the"
13733,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","breakfast-room that morning, a few stanzas addressed to her, and, while"
13734,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","putting the book into her hand, in his own study, standing by his desk,"
13735,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","he said to her in my presence--""I should not have done anything of this"
13736,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",kind but for your father's sake: they are probably the last verses I
13737,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","shall ever write."" They show how much his mind was impaired, not by"
13738,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","the strain of thought but by the execution, some of the lines being"
13739,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","imperfect, and one stanza wanting corresponding rhymes: one letter, the"
13740,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","initial S, had been omitted in the spelling of his own name. In this"
13741,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","interview also it was that, upon my expressing a hope of his health"
13742,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","being benefited by the climate of the country to which he was going,"
13743,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","and by the interest he would take in the classic remembrances of Italy,"
13744,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",he made use of the quotation from _Yarrow Unvisited_ as recorded by me
13745,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",in the _Musings of Aquapendente_ six years afterwards. Mr. Lockhart has
13746,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",mentioned in his life of him what I heard from several quarters while
13747,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","abroad, both at Rome and elsewhere, that little seemed to interest him"
13748,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",but what he could collect or hear of the fugitive Stuarts and their
13749,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",adherents who had followed them into exile. Both the _Yarrow Revisited_
13750,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","and the ""Sonnet"" were sent him before his departure from England. Some"
13751,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",further particulars of the conversations which occurred during this
13752,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",visit I should have set down had they not been already accurately
13753,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",recorded by Mr. Lockhart. I first became acquainted with this great and
13754,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","amiable man--Sir Walter Scott--in the year 1803, when my sister and I,"
13755,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","making a tour in Scotland, were hospitably received by him in Lasswade"
13756,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.","upon the banks of the Esk, where he was then living. We saw a good deal"
13757,"ENGLISH BORDER, IN THE AUTUMN OF 1831.",of him in the course of the following week; the particulars are given

14536,FOOTNOTES:,"on a pedestrian tour to John o' Groat's house, was to sleep in the barn"

14544,FOOTNOTES:,"two chests, upon one of which stood milk in wooden vessels, covered"
14545,FOOTNOTES:,over. The walls of the house were of stone unplastered: it consisted of
14546,FOOTNOTES:,"three apartments, the cowhouse at one end, the kitchen or house in the"

14549,FOOTNOTES:,was a free passage for light and smoke from one end of the house to the
14550,FOOTNOTES:,other. I went to bed some time before the rest of the family; the door
14551,FOOTNOTES:,"was shut between us, and they had a bright fire, which I could not see,"
14552,FOOTNOTES:,"but the light it sent up amongst[717] the varnished rafters and beams,"
14553,FOOTNOTES:,which crossed each other in almost as intricate and fantastic a manner
14554,FOOTNOTES:,as I have seen the under-boughs of a large beech tree withered by the
14555,FOOTNOTES:,"depth of shade above, produced the most beautiful effect that can be"

14557,FOOTNOTES:,"temple to be, with a dripping or moist roof, and the moonlight entering"
14558,FOOTNOTES:,in upon it by some means or other: and yet the colours were more like
14559,FOOTNOTES:,those of melted gems. I lay looking up till the light of the fire
14560,FOOTNOTES:,"faded away, and the man and his wife and child had crept into their"
14561,FOOTNOTES:,"bed at the other end of the room: I did not sleep much, but passed a"
14562,FOOTNOTES:,"comfortable night; for my bed, though hard, was warm and clean: the"
14563,FOOTNOTES:,unusualness of my situation prevented me from sleeping. I could hear
14564,FOOTNOTES:,the waves beat against the shore of the lake: a little rill close to
14565,FOOTNOTES:,"the door made a much louder noise, and, when I sat up in my bed, I"
14566,FOOTNOTES:,could see the lake through an open window-place at the bed's head. Add
14567,FOOTNOTES:,"to this, it rained all night. I was less occupied by remembrance of the"
14568,FOOTNOTES:,"Trosachs, beautiful as they were, than the vision of the Highland hut,"
14569,FOOTNOTES:,which I could not get out of my head; I thought of the Faery-land of

14725,FOOTNOTES:,"and priory impart to each other; and the river Clyde flows on, smooth"
14726,FOOTNOTES:,"and unruffled below, seeming to my thoughts more in harmony with the"
