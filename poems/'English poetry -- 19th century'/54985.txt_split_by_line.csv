902,II.,"On Sundays, too, a priest doth come"
903,II.,"From the walled town beyond the pass,"
904,II.,Down the mountain-way;
905,II.,"And then you hear the organ’s hum,"
906,II.,"You hear the white-robed priest say mass,"
907,II.,And the people pray.
908,II.,But else the woods and fields are dumb
909,II.,Round the Church of Brou.
910,II.,
911,II.,"And after church, when mass is done,"
912,II.,The people to the nave repair
913,II.,Round the tomb to stray;
914,II.,"And marvel at the forms of stone,"
915,II.,And praise the chiselled broideries rare--
916,II.,Then they drop away.

927,III.,"Where horn, and hound, and vassals, never come."
928,III.,Only the blessed saints are smiling dumb
929,III.,From the rich painted windows of the nave
930,III.,"On aisle, and transept, and your marble grave;"
931,III.,"Where thou, young prince, shalt never more arise"
932,III.,"From the fringed mattress where thy duchess lies,"
933,III.,"On autumn-mornings, when the bugle sounds,"
934,III.,And ride across the drawbridge with thy hounds
935,III.,To hunt the boar in the crisp woods till eve;
936,III.,"And thou, O princess, shalt no more receive,"
937,III.,"Thou and thy ladies, in the hall of state,"
938,III.,"The jaded hunters with their bloody freight,"
939,III.,Coming benighted to the castle-gate.
940,III.,"So sleep, forever sleep, O marble pair!"
941,III.,"Or, if ye wake, let it be then, when fair"
942,III.,On the carved western front a flood of light
943,III.,"Streams from the setting sun, and colors bright"
944,III.,"Prophets, transfigured saints, and martyrs brave,"
945,III.,In the vast western window of the nave;
946,III.,And on the pavement round the tomb there glints
947,III.,"A checker-work of glowing sapphire-tints,"
948,III.,"And amethyst, and ruby,--then unclose"
949,III.,"Your eyelids on the stone where ye repose,"
950,III.,"And from your broidered pillows lift your heads,"
951,III.,And rise upon your cold white marble beds;
952,III.,And looking down on the warm rosy tints
953,III.,"Which checker, at your feet, the illumined flints,"
954,III.,"Say, _What is this? we are in bliss--forgiven--"
955,III.,Behold the pavement of the courts of heaven!_
956,III.,"Or let it be on autumn-nights, when rain"
957,III.,Doth rustlingly above your heads complain
958,III.,"On the smooth leaden roof, and on the walls"
959,III.,Shedding her pensive light at intervals
960,III.,"The moon through the clere-story windows shines,"
961,III.,"And the wind washes through the mountain-pines,--"
962,III.,"Then, gazing up ’mid the dim pillars high,"
963,III.,"The foliaged marble forest where ye lie,"
964,III.,"_Hush_, ye will say, _it is eternity!"
965,III.,"This is the glimmering verge of heaven, and these"
966,III.,The columns of the heavenly palaces._
967,III.,And in the sweeping of the wind your ear
968,III.,"The passage of the angels’ wings will hear,"
969,III.,And on the lichen-crusted leads above
970,III.,The rustle of the eternal rain of love.

1306,_THE NEW SIRENS._,
1307,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Storms unsmoothed your folded valleys,"
1308,_THE NEW SIRENS._,And made all your cedars frown;
1309,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Leaves were whirling in the alleys
1310,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Which your lovers wandered down.
1311,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"--Sitting cheerless in your bowers,"
1312,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"The hands propping the sunk head,"
1313,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Do they gall you, the long hours,"
1314,_THE NEW SIRENS._,And the hungry thought that must be fed?
1315,_THE NEW SIRENS._,
1316,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Is the pleasure that is tasted
1317,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Patient of a long review?
1318,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Will the fire joy hath wasted,"
1319,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Mused on, warm the heart anew?"
1320,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"--Or, are those old thoughts returning,"

1323,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Germs, your untrimmed passion overgrew?"
1324,_THE NEW SIRENS._,
1325,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Once, like us, you took your station,"
1326,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Watchers for a purer fire;
1327,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"But you drooped in expectation,"
1328,_THE NEW SIRENS._,And you wearied in desire.
1329,_THE NEW SIRENS._,When the first rose flush was steeping
1330,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"All the frore peak’s awful crown,"
1331,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Shepherds say, they found you sleeping"
1332,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"In some windless valley, farther down."
1333,_THE NEW SIRENS._,
1334,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Then you wept, and slowly raising"
1335,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Your dozed eyelids, sought again,"
1336,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Half in doubt, they say, and gazing"
1337,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Sadly back, the seats of men;"
1338,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Snatched a turbid inspiration
1339,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"From some transient earthly sun,"
1340,_THE NEW SIRENS._,And proclaimed your vain ovation

1346,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"With a stately, slow surprise,"
1347,_THE NEW SIRENS._,From their earthward-bound devotion
1348,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Lifting up your languid eyes--
1349,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Would you freeze my louder boldness,"
1350,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Dumbly smiling as you go,"
1351,_THE NEW SIRENS._,One faint frown of distant coldness
1352,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Flitting fast across each marble brow?
1353,_THE NEW SIRENS._,
1354,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Do I brighten at your sorrow,"
1355,_THE NEW SIRENS._,O sweet pleaders? doth my lot

1370,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Glancing feet, and eager eyes!"
1371,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Let your broad lamps flash the brightness
1372,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Which the sorrow-stricken day denies.
1373,_THE NEW SIRENS._,
1374,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Through black depths of serried shadows,"
1375,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Up cold aisles of buried glade;
1376,_THE NEW SIRENS._,In the mist of river-meadows
1377,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Where the looming deer are laid;
1378,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"From your dazzled windows streaming,"

1380,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Deep and far, a broken gleaming"
1381,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Reels and shivers on the ruffled gloom.
1382,_THE NEW SIRENS._,
1383,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Where I stand, the grass is glowing:"
1384,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Doubtless you are passing fair!
1385,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"But I hear the north wind blowing,"
1386,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"And I feel the cold night-air,"
1387,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Can I look on your sweet faces,"
1388,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"And your proud heads backward thrown,"
1389,_THE NEW SIRENS._,From this dusk of leaf-strewn places
1390,_THE NEW SIRENS._,With the dumb woods and the night alone?
1391,_THE NEW SIRENS._,
1392,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Yet, indeed, this flux of guesses,--"

1394,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Mirth to-day, and vine-bound tresses,"

1397,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Could life run no happier way?
1398,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Joyous at the height of pleasure,"
1399,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Passive at the nadir of dismay?
1400,_THE NEW SIRENS._,
1401,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"But, indeed, this proud possession,"
1402,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"This far-reaching, magic chain,"
1403,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Linking in a mad succession
1404,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Fits of joy and fits of pain,--"
1405,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Have you seen it at the closing?
1406,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Have you tracked its clouded ways?
1407,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Can your eyes, while fools are dozing,"
1408,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Drop, with mine, adown life’s latter days?"
1409,_THE NEW SIRENS._,
1410,_THE NEW SIRENS._,When a dreary light is wading
1411,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Through this waste of sunless greens,"
1412,_THE NEW SIRENS._,When the flashing lights are fading
1413,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"On the peerless cheek of queens,"
1414,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"When the mean shall no more sorrow,"
1415,_THE NEW SIRENS._,And the proudest no more smile;
1416,_THE NEW SIRENS._,While the dawning of the morrow
1417,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Widens slowly westward all that while?
1418,_THE NEW SIRENS._,
1419,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Then, when change itself is over,"
1420,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"When the slow tide sets one way,"
1421,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Shall you find the radiant lover,"
1422,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Even by moments, of to-day?"
1423,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"The eye wanders, faith is failing:"
1424,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Oh, loose hands, and let it be!"
1425,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Proudly, like a king bewailing,"

1427,_THE NEW SIRENS._,
1428,_THE NEW SIRENS._,All true speech and large avowal

1438,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Our rapt souls on your replies,"
1439,_THE NEW SIRENS._,In a wistful silence reading
1440,_THE NEW SIRENS._,All the meaning of your eyes.
1441,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"By moss-bordered statues sitting,"
1442,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"By well-heads, in summer days."
1443,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"But we turn, our eyes are flitting--"

1445,_THE NEW SIRENS._,
1446,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"And you too, O worshipped Graces,"

1448,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Is there doubt on divine faces?
1449,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Are the blessed gods dismayed?
1450,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Can men worship the wan features,"
1451,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"The sunk eyes, the wailing tone,"
1452,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Of unsphered, discrownèd creatures,"
1453,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Souls as little godlike as their own?
1454,_THE NEW SIRENS._,
1455,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Come, loose hands! The wingèd fleetness"
1456,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Of immortal feet is gone;
1457,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"And your scents have shed their sweetness,"
1458,_THE NEW SIRENS._,And your flowers are overblown.
1459,_THE NEW SIRENS._,And your jewelled gauds surrender
1460,_THE NEW SIRENS._,Half their glories to the day;

1467,_THE NEW SIRENS._,At divorce which it proclaims.

1476,_THE NEW SIRENS._,"Dusk, oh, dusk the hall with yew!"

2083,TO FAUSTA.,Of struggle these necessitate;
2084,TO FAUSTA.,Whom schooling of the stubborn mind
2085,TO FAUSTA.,"Hath made, or birth hath found, resigned,--"
2086,TO FAUSTA.,"These mourn not, that their goings pay"
2087,TO FAUSTA.,Obedience to the passing day.
2088,TO FAUSTA.,These claim not every laughing hour
2089,TO FAUSTA.,For handmaid to their striding power;
2090,TO FAUSTA.,"Each in her turn, with torch upreared,"
2091,TO FAUSTA.,"To await their march; and when appeared,"
2092,TO FAUSTA.,"Through the cold gloom, with measured race,"
2093,TO FAUSTA.,To usher for a destined space
2094,TO FAUSTA.,(Her own sweet errands all foregone)
2095,TO FAUSTA.,The too imperious traveller on.
2096,TO FAUSTA.,"These, Fausta, ask not this; nor thou,"
2097,TO FAUSTA.,"Time’s chafing prisoner, ask it now!"
2098,TO FAUSTA.,
2099,TO FAUSTA.,"We left just ten years since, you say,"
2100,TO FAUSTA.,That wayside inn we left to-day.[4]
2101,TO FAUSTA.,"Our jovial host, as forth we fare,"
2102,TO FAUSTA.,Shouts greeting from his easy-chair.
2103,TO FAUSTA.,"High on a bank our leader stands,"
2104,TO FAUSTA.,"Reviews and ranks his motley bands,"
2105,TO FAUSTA.,"Makes clear our goal to every eye,--"
2106,TO FAUSTA.,The valley’s western boundary.
2107,TO FAUSTA.,A gate swings to! our tide hath flowed
2108,TO FAUSTA.,Already from the silent road.
2109,TO FAUSTA.,"The valley-pastures, one by one,"
2110,TO FAUSTA.,"Are threaded, quiet in the sun;"
2111,TO FAUSTA.,"And now, beyond the rude stone bridge,"
2112,TO FAUSTA.,Slopes gracious up the western ridge.
2113,TO FAUSTA.,"Its woody border, and the last"
2114,TO FAUSTA.,"Of its dark upland farms, is past;"
2115,TO FAUSTA.,"Cool farms, with open-lying stores,"
2116,TO FAUSTA.,"Under their burnished sycamores,--"
2117,TO FAUSTA.,All past! and through the trees we glide
2118,TO FAUSTA.,Emerging on the green hillside.
2119,TO FAUSTA.,"There climbing hangs, a far-seen sign,"
2120,TO FAUSTA.,"Our wavering, many-colored line;"
2121,TO FAUSTA.,"There winds, up-streaming slowly still"
2122,TO FAUSTA.,Over the summit of the hill.
2123,TO FAUSTA.,"And now, in front, behold outspread"
2124,TO FAUSTA.,"Those upper regions we must tread,--"
2125,TO FAUSTA.,"Mild hollows, and clear heathy swells,"
2126,TO FAUSTA.,The cheerful silence of the fells.
2127,TO FAUSTA.,
2128,TO FAUSTA.,"Some two hours’ march, with serious air,"
2129,TO FAUSTA.,Through the deep noontide heats we fare;
2130,TO FAUSTA.,"The red-grouse, springing at our sound,"
2131,TO FAUSTA.,"Skims, now and then, the shining ground;"
2132,TO FAUSTA.,"No life, save his and ours, intrudes"
2133,TO FAUSTA.,Upon these breathless solitudes.
2134,TO FAUSTA.,"Oh, joy! again the farms appear."
2135,TO FAUSTA.,"Cool shade is there, and rustic cheer;"
2136,TO FAUSTA.,"There springs the brook will guide us down,"
2137,TO FAUSTA.,"Bright comrade, to the noisy town."
2138,TO FAUSTA.,"Lingering, we follow down; we gain"
2139,TO FAUSTA.,"The town, the highway, and the plain."
2140,TO FAUSTA.,"And many a mile of dusty way,"
2141,TO FAUSTA.,"Parched and road-worn, we made that day;"
2142,TO FAUSTA.,"But, Fausta, I remember well,"
2143,TO FAUSTA.,"That as the balmy darkness fell,"
2144,TO FAUSTA.,"We bathed our hands with speechless glee,"
2145,TO FAUSTA.,"That night, in the wide-glimmering sea."
2146,TO FAUSTA.,
2147,TO FAUSTA.,"Once more we tread this self-same road,"
2148,TO FAUSTA.,"Fausta, which ten years since we trod;"
2149,TO FAUSTA.,"Alone we tread it, you and I,"
2150,TO FAUSTA.,Ghosts of that boisterous company.
2151,TO FAUSTA.,"Here, where the brook shines, near its head,"
2152,TO FAUSTA.,"In its clear, shallow, turf-fringed bed;"
2153,TO FAUSTA.,"Here, whence the eye first sees, far down,"
2154,TO FAUSTA.,"Capped with faint smoke, the noisy town,--"
2155,TO FAUSTA.,"Here sit we, and again unroll,"
2156,TO FAUSTA.,"Though slowly, the familiar whole."
2157,TO FAUSTA.,The solemn wastes of heathy hill
2158,TO FAUSTA.,Sleep in the July sunshine still;
2159,TO FAUSTA.,"The self-same shadows now, as then,"
2160,TO FAUSTA.,Play through this grassy upland glen;
2161,TO FAUSTA.,The loose dark stones on the green way
2162,TO FAUSTA.,"Lie strewn, it seems, where then they lay;"
2163,TO FAUSTA.,"On this mild bank above the stream,"
2164,TO FAUSTA.,(You crush them!) the blue gentians gleam.
2165,TO FAUSTA.,"Still this wild brook, the rushes cool,"
2166,TO FAUSTA.,"The sailing foam, the shining pool!"
2167,TO FAUSTA.,"These are not changed; and we, you say,"
2168,TO FAUSTA.,"Are scarce more changed, in truth, than they."
2169,TO FAUSTA.,
2170,TO FAUSTA.,"The gypsies, whom we met below,"
2171,TO FAUSTA.,They too have long roamed to and fro;
2172,TO FAUSTA.,"They ramble, leaving, where they pass,"
2173,TO FAUSTA.,Their fragments on the cumbered grass.
2174,TO FAUSTA.,And often to some kindly place
2175,TO FAUSTA.,"Chance guides the migratory race,"
2176,TO FAUSTA.,"Where, though long wanderings intervene,"
2177,TO FAUSTA.,They recognize a former scene.
2178,TO FAUSTA.,The dingy tents are pitched; the fires
2179,TO FAUSTA.,Give to the wind their wavering spires;
2180,TO FAUSTA.,In dark knots crouch round the wild flame
2181,TO FAUSTA.,"Their children, as when first they came;"
2182,TO FAUSTA.,They see their shackled beasts again
2183,TO FAUSTA.,"Move, browsing, up the gray-walled lane."
2184,TO FAUSTA.,"Signs are not wanting, which might raise"
2185,TO FAUSTA.,"The ghost in them of former days,--"
2186,TO FAUSTA.,"Signs are not wanting, if they would;"
2187,TO FAUSTA.,Suggestions to disquietude.
2188,TO FAUSTA.,"For them, for all, time’s busy touch,"
2189,TO FAUSTA.,"While it mends little, troubles much."
2190,TO FAUSTA.,Their joints grow stiffer--but the year
2191,TO FAUSTA.,Runs his old round of dubious cheer;
2192,TO FAUSTA.,"Chilly they grow--yet winds in March,"
2193,TO FAUSTA.,"Still, sharp as ever, freeze and parch;"
2194,TO FAUSTA.,"They must live still--and yet, God knows,"
2195,TO FAUSTA.,Crowded and keen the country grows;
2196,TO FAUSTA.,"It seems as if, in their decay,"
2197,TO FAUSTA.,The law grew stronger every day.
2198,TO FAUSTA.,"So might they reason, so compare,"
2199,TO FAUSTA.,"Fausta, times past with times that are;"
2200,TO FAUSTA.,But no! they rubbed through yesterday
2201,TO FAUSTA.,"In their hereditary way,"
2202,TO FAUSTA.,"And they will rub through, if they can,"
2203,TO FAUSTA.,"To-morrow on the self-same plan,"
2204,TO FAUSTA.,"Till death arrive to supersede,"
2205,TO FAUSTA.,"For them, vicissitude and need."
2206,TO FAUSTA.,
2207,TO FAUSTA.,"The poet, to whose mighty heart"
2208,TO FAUSTA.,"Heaven doth a quicker pulse impart,"
2209,TO FAUSTA.,Subdues that energy to scan
2210,TO FAUSTA.,"Not his own course, but that of man."
2211,TO FAUSTA.,"Though he move mountains, though his day"
2212,TO FAUSTA.,"Be passed on the proud heights of sway,"
2213,TO FAUSTA.,"Though he hath loosed a thousand chains,"
2214,TO FAUSTA.,"Though he hath borne immortal pains,"
2215,TO FAUSTA.,"Action and suffering though he know,--"
2216,TO FAUSTA.,"He hath not lived, if he lives so."
2217,TO FAUSTA.,"He sees, in some great-historied land,"
2218,TO FAUSTA.,"A ruler of the people stand,"
2219,TO FAUSTA.,Sees his strong thought in fiery flood
2220,TO FAUSTA.,"Roll through the heaving multitude,"
2221,TO FAUSTA.,Exults--yet for no moment’s space
2222,TO FAUSTA.,Envies the all-regarded place.
2223,TO FAUSTA.,"Beautiful eyes meet his, and he"
2224,TO FAUSTA.,Bears to admire uncravingly;
2225,TO FAUSTA.,"They pass: he, mingled with the crowd,"
2226,TO FAUSTA.,Is in their far-off triumphs proud.
2227,TO FAUSTA.,
2228,TO FAUSTA.,"From some high station he looks down,"
2229,TO FAUSTA.,"At sunset, on a populous town;"
2230,TO FAUSTA.,"Surveys each happy group which fleets,"
2231,TO FAUSTA.,"Toil ended, through the shining streets,--"
2232,TO FAUSTA.,"Each with some errand of its own,--"
2233,TO FAUSTA.,"And does not say, _I am alone_."
2234,TO FAUSTA.,He sees the gentle stir of birth
2235,TO FAUSTA.,When morning purifies the earth;
2236,TO FAUSTA.,"He leans upon a gate, and sees"
2237,TO FAUSTA.,"The pastures, and the quiet trees."
2238,TO FAUSTA.,"Low, woody hill, with gracious bound,"
2239,TO FAUSTA.,Folds the still valley almost round;
2240,TO FAUSTA.,"The cuckoo, loud on some high lawn,"
2241,TO FAUSTA.,Is answered from the depth of dawn;
2242,TO FAUSTA.,"In the hedge straggling to the stream,"
2243,TO FAUSTA.,"Pale, dew-drenched, half-shut roses gleam."
2244,TO FAUSTA.,"But, where the farther side slopes down,"
2245,TO FAUSTA.,He sees the drowsy new-waked clown
2246,TO FAUSTA.,In his white quaint-embroidered frock
2247,TO FAUSTA.,"Make, whistling, toward his mist-wreathed flock,"
2248,TO FAUSTA.,"Slowly, behind his heavy tread,"
2249,TO FAUSTA.,"The wet, flowered grass heaves up its head."
2250,TO FAUSTA.,"Leaned on his gate, he gazes: tears"
2251,TO FAUSTA.,"Are in his eyes, and in his ears"
2252,TO FAUSTA.,The murmur of a thousand years.
2253,TO FAUSTA.,"Before him he sees life unroll,"
2254,TO FAUSTA.,"A placid and continuous whole,--"
2255,TO FAUSTA.,"That general life, which does not cease,"
2256,TO FAUSTA.,"Whose secret is not joy, but peace;"
2257,TO FAUSTA.,"That life, whose dumb wish is not missed"
2258,TO FAUSTA.,"If birth proceeds, if things subsist;"
2259,TO FAUSTA.,"The life of plants, and stones, and rain,"
2260,TO FAUSTA.,The life he craves--if not in vain
2261,TO FAUSTA.,"Fate gave, what chance shall not control,"
2262,TO FAUSTA.,His sad lucidity of soul.
2263,TO FAUSTA.,
2264,TO FAUSTA.,"You listen; but that wandering smile,"
2265,TO FAUSTA.,"Fausta, betrays you cold the while!"
2266,TO FAUSTA.,Your eyes pursue the bells of foam
2267,TO FAUSTA.,"Washed, eddying, from this bank, their home."
2268,TO FAUSTA.,_Those gypsies_--so your thoughts I scan--
2269,TO FAUSTA.,"_Are less, the poet more, than man_."
2270,TO FAUSTA.,"_They feel not, though they move and see._"
2271,TO FAUSTA.,_Deeper the poet feels; but he_
2272,TO FAUSTA.,"_Breathes, when he will, immortal air,_"
2273,TO FAUSTA.,_Where Orpheus and where Homer are._
2274,TO FAUSTA.,"_In the day’s life, whose iron round_"
2275,TO FAUSTA.,"_Hems us all in, he is not bound;_"
2276,TO FAUSTA.,"_He leaves his kind, o’erleaps their pen,_"
2277,TO FAUSTA.,_And flees the common life of men._
2278,TO FAUSTA.,"_He escapes thence, but we abide._"
2279,TO FAUSTA.,"_ Not deep the poet sees, but wide._"
2280,TO FAUSTA.,
2281,TO FAUSTA.,The world in which we live and move
2282,TO FAUSTA.,"Outlasts aversion, outlasts love,"
2283,TO FAUSTA.,"Outlasts each effort, interest, hope,"
2284,TO FAUSTA.,"Remorse, grief, joy; and, were the scope"
2285,TO FAUSTA.,"Of these affections wider made,"
2286,TO FAUSTA.,"Man still would see, and see dismayed,"
2287,TO FAUSTA.,"Beyond his passion’s widest range,"
2288,TO FAUSTA.,Far regions of eternal change.
2289,TO FAUSTA.,"Nay, and since death, which wipes out man,"
2290,TO FAUSTA.,"Finds him with many an unsolved plan,"
2291,TO FAUSTA.,"With much unknown, and much untried,"
2292,TO FAUSTA.,"Wonder not dead, and thirst not dried,"
2293,TO FAUSTA.,Still gazing on the ever full
2294,TO FAUSTA.,"Eternal mundane spectacle,--"
2295,TO FAUSTA.,"This world in which we draw our breath,"
2296,TO FAUSTA.,"In some sense, Fausta, outlasts death."
2297,TO FAUSTA.,
2298,TO FAUSTA.,"Blame thou not, therefore, him who dares"
2299,TO FAUSTA.,Judge vain beforehand human cares;
2300,TO FAUSTA.,Whose natural insight can discern
2301,TO FAUSTA.,What through experience others learn;
2302,TO FAUSTA.,"Who needs not love and power, to know"
2303,TO FAUSTA.,"Love transient, power an unreal show;"
2304,TO FAUSTA.,Who treads at ease life’s uncheered ways:
2305,TO FAUSTA.,"Him blame not, Fausta, rather praise!"
2306,TO FAUSTA.,"Rather thyself for some aim pray,"
2307,TO FAUSTA.,"Nobler than this, to fill the day;"
2308,TO FAUSTA.,"Rather that heart, which burns in thee,"
2309,TO FAUSTA.,"Ask, not to amuse, but to set free;"
2310,TO FAUSTA.,Be passionate hopes not ill resigned
2311,TO FAUSTA.,"For quiet, and a fearless mind."
2312,TO FAUSTA.,And though fate grudge to thee and me
2313,TO FAUSTA.,"The poet’s rapt security,"
2314,TO FAUSTA.,"Yet they, believe me, who await"
2315,TO FAUSTA.,"No gifts from chance, have conquered fate."
2316,TO FAUSTA.,"They, winning room to see and hear,"
2317,TO FAUSTA.,"And to men’s business not too near,"
2318,TO FAUSTA.,Through clouds of individual strife
2319,TO FAUSTA.,Draw homeward to the general life.
2320,TO FAUSTA.,Like leaves by suns not yet uncurled;
2321,TO FAUSTA.,"To the wise, foolish; to the world,"
2322,TO FAUSTA.,"Weak: yet not weak, I might reply,"
2323,TO FAUSTA.,"Not foolish, Fausta, in His eye,"
2324,TO FAUSTA.,"To whom each moment in its race,"
2325,TO FAUSTA.,"Crowd as we will its neutral space,"
2326,TO FAUSTA.,Is but a quiet watershed
2327,TO FAUSTA.,"Whence, equally, the seas of life and death are fed."
2328,TO FAUSTA.,
2329,TO FAUSTA.,"Enough, we live! and if a life"
2330,TO FAUSTA.,"With large results so little rife,"
2331,TO FAUSTA.,"Though bearable, seem hardly worth"
2332,TO FAUSTA.,"This pomp of worlds, this pain of birth;"
2333,TO FAUSTA.,"Yet, Fausta, the mute turf we tread,"
2334,TO FAUSTA.,"The solemn hills around us spread,"
2335,TO FAUSTA.,"This stream which falls incessantly,"
2336,TO FAUSTA.,"The strange-scrawled rocks, the lonely sky,"
2337,TO FAUSTA.,"If I might lend their life a voice,"
2338,TO FAUSTA.,Seem to bear rather than rejoice.
2339,TO FAUSTA.,And even could the intemperate prayer
2340,TO FAUSTA.,"Man iterates, while these forbear,"
2341,TO FAUSTA.,"For movement, for an ampler sphere,"
2342,TO FAUSTA.,Pierce Fate’s impenetrable ear;
2343,TO FAUSTA.,Not milder is the general lot
2344,TO FAUSTA.,"Because our spirits have forgot,"
2345,TO FAUSTA.,"In action’s dizzying eddy whirled,"
2346,TO FAUSTA.,The something that infects the world.

2359,AN EPISODE.,
2360,AN EPISODE.,
2361,AN EPISODE.,"And the first gray of morning filled the east,"
2362,AN EPISODE.,And the fog rose out of the Oxus stream.
2363,AN EPISODE.,But all the Tartar camp along the stream
2364,AN EPISODE.,"Was hushed, and still the men were plunged in sleep."
2365,AN EPISODE.,"Sohrab alone, he slept not; all night long"
2366,AN EPISODE.,"He had lain wakeful, tossing on his bed:"
2367,AN EPISODE.,"But when the gray dawn stole into his tent,"
2368,AN EPISODE.,"He rose, and clad himself, and girt his sword,"
2369,AN EPISODE.,"And took his horseman’s cloak, and left his tent,"
2370,AN EPISODE.,"And went abroad into the cold wet fog,"
2371,AN EPISODE.,Through the dim camp to Peran-Wisa’s tent.
2372,AN EPISODE.,"Through the black Tartar tents he passed, which stood"
2373,AN EPISODE.,Clustering like bee-hives on the low flat strand
2374,AN EPISODE.,"Of Oxus, where the summer-floods o’erflow"
2375,AN EPISODE.,When the sun melts the snows in high Pamere;
2376,AN EPISODE.,"Through the black tents he passed, o’er that low strand,"
2377,AN EPISODE.,"And to a hillock came, a little back"
2378,AN EPISODE.,"From the stream’s brink,--the spot where first a boat,"
2379,AN EPISODE.,"Crossing the stream in summer, scrapes the land."
2380,AN EPISODE.,The men of former times had crowned the top
2381,AN EPISODE.,"With a clay fort; but that was fallen, and now"
2382,AN EPISODE.,"The Tartars built there Peran-Wisa’s tent,"
2383,AN EPISODE.,"A dome of laths, and o’er it felts were spread."
2384,AN EPISODE.,"And Sohrab came there, and went in, and stood"
2385,AN EPISODE.,"Upon the thick piled carpets in the tent,"
2386,AN EPISODE.,And found the old man sleeping on his bed
2387,AN EPISODE.,"Of rugs and felts, and near him lay his arms."
2388,AN EPISODE.,"And Peran-Wisa heard him, though the step"
2389,AN EPISODE.,"Was dulled; for he slept light, an old man’s sleep;"
2390,AN EPISODE.,"And he rose quickly on one arm, and said,--"
2391,AN EPISODE.,“Who art thou? for it is not yet clear dawn.
2392,AN EPISODE.,"Speak! is there news, or any night alarm?”"
2393,AN EPISODE.,"But Sohrab came to the bedside, and said,--"
2394,AN EPISODE.,"“Thou know’st me, Peran-Wisa! it is I."
2395,AN EPISODE.,"The sun has not yet risen, and the foe"
2396,AN EPISODE.,Sleep: but I sleep not; all night long I lie
2397,AN EPISODE.,"Tossing and wakeful, and I come to thee."
2398,AN EPISODE.,For so did King Afrasiab bid me seek
2399,AN EPISODE.,"Thy counsel, and to heed thee as thy son,"
2400,AN EPISODE.,"In Samarcand, before the army marched;"
2401,AN EPISODE.,And I will tell thee what my heart desires.
2402,AN EPISODE.,"Thou know’st if, since from Ader-baijan first"
2403,AN EPISODE.,"I came among the Tartars, and bore arms,"
2404,AN EPISODE.,"I have still served Afrasiab well, and shown,"
2405,AN EPISODE.,"At my boy’s years, the courage of a man."
2406,AN EPISODE.,"This too thou know’st, that while I still bear on"
2407,AN EPISODE.,"The conquering Tartar ensigns through the world,"
2408,AN EPISODE.,"And beat the Persians back on every field,"
2409,AN EPISODE.,"I seek one man, one man, and one alone,--"
2410,AN EPISODE.,"Rustum, my father; who I hoped should greet,"
2411,AN EPISODE.,"Should one day greet, upon some well-fought field,"
2412,AN EPISODE.,"His not unworthy, not inglorious son."
2413,AN EPISODE.,"So I long hoped, but him I never find."
2414,AN EPISODE.,"Come then, hear now, and grant me what I ask."
2415,AN EPISODE.,Let the two armies rest to-day; but I
2416,AN EPISODE.,Will challenge forth the bravest Persian lords
2417,AN EPISODE.,"To meet me, man to man: if I prevail,"
2418,AN EPISODE.,Rustum will surely hear it; if I fall--
2419,AN EPISODE.,"Old man, the dead need no one, claim no kin."
2420,AN EPISODE.,"Dim is the rumor of a common fight,"
2421,AN EPISODE.,"Where host meets host, and many names are sunk;"
2422,AN EPISODE.,But of a single combat fame speaks clear.”
2423,AN EPISODE.,He spoke; and Peran-Wisa took the hand
2424,AN EPISODE.,"Of the young man in his, and sighed, and said,--"
2425,AN EPISODE.,"“O Sohrab, an unquiet heart is thine!"
2426,AN EPISODE.,"Canst thou not rest among the Tartar chiefs,"
2427,AN EPISODE.,And share the battle’s common chance with us
2428,AN EPISODE.,"Who love thee, but must press forever first,"
2429,AN EPISODE.,"In single fight incurring single risk,"
2430,AN EPISODE.,To find a father thou hast never seen?
2431,AN EPISODE.,"That were far best, my son, to stay with us"
2432,AN EPISODE.,"Unmurmuring; in our tents, while it is war,"
2433,AN EPISODE.,"And when ’tis truce, then in Afrasiab’s towns."
2434,AN EPISODE.,"But if this one desire indeed rules all,"
2435,AN EPISODE.,To seek out Rustum--seek him not through fight!
2436,AN EPISODE.,"Seek him in peace, and carry to his arms,"
2437,AN EPISODE.,"O Sohrab, carry an unwounded son!"
2438,AN EPISODE.,"But far hence seek him, for he is not here."
2439,AN EPISODE.,"For now it is not as when I was young,"
2440,AN EPISODE.,When Rustum was in front of every fray:
2441,AN EPISODE.,"But now he keeps apart, and sits at home,"
2442,AN EPISODE.,"In Seistan, with Zal, his father old;"
2443,AN EPISODE.,Whether that his own mighty strength at last
2444,AN EPISODE.,Feels the abhorred approaches of old age;
2445,AN EPISODE.,Or in some quarrel with the Persian king.
2446,AN EPISODE.,There go!--Thou wilt not? Yet my heart forebodes
2447,AN EPISODE.,Danger or death awaits thee on this field.
2448,AN EPISODE.,"Fain would I know thee safe and well, though lost"
2449,AN EPISODE.,To us; fain therefore send thee hence in peace
2450,AN EPISODE.,"To seek thy father, not seek single fights"
2451,AN EPISODE.,In vain. But who can keep the lion’s cub
2452,AN EPISODE.,"From ravening, and who govern Rustum’s son?"
2453,AN EPISODE.,"Go, I will grant thee what thy heart desires.”"
2454,AN EPISODE.,"So said he, and dropped Sohrab’s hand, and left"
2455,AN EPISODE.,"His bed, and the warm rugs whereon he lay;"
2456,AN EPISODE.,And o’er his chilly limbs his woollen coat
2457,AN EPISODE.,"He passed, and tied his sandals on his feet,"
2458,AN EPISODE.,"And threw a white cloak round him, and he took"
2459,AN EPISODE.,"In his right hand a ruler’s staff, no sword;"
2460,AN EPISODE.,"And on his head he set his sheep-skin cap,"
2461,AN EPISODE.,"Black, glossy, curled, the fleece of Kara-Kul;"
2462,AN EPISODE.,"And raised the curtain of his tent, and called"
2463,AN EPISODE.,"His herald to his side, and went abroad."
2464,AN EPISODE.,"The sun by this had risen, and cleared the fog"
2465,AN EPISODE.,From the broad Oxus and the glittering sands.
2466,AN EPISODE.,And from their tents the Tartar horsemen filed
2467,AN EPISODE.,"Into the open plain: so Haman bade,--"
2468,AN EPISODE.,"Haman, who next to Peran-Wisa ruled"
2469,AN EPISODE.,"The host, and still was in his lusty prime."
2470,AN EPISODE.,"From their black tents, long files of horse, they streamed;"
2471,AN EPISODE.,"As when some gray November morn the files,"
2472,AN EPISODE.,"In marching order spread, of long-necked cranes"
2473,AN EPISODE.,Stream over Casbin and the southern slopes
2474,AN EPISODE.,"Of Elburz, from the Aralian estuaries,"
2475,AN EPISODE.,"Or some frore Caspian reed-bed, southward bound"
2476,AN EPISODE.,"For the warm Persian seaboard,--so they streamed."
2477,AN EPISODE.,"The Tartars of the Oxus, the king’s guard,"
2478,AN EPISODE.,"First, with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears;"
2479,AN EPISODE.,"Large men, large steeds, who from Bokhara come"
2480,AN EPISODE.,"And Khiva, and ferment the milk of mares."
2481,AN EPISODE.,"Next, the more temperate Toorkmuns of the south,"
2482,AN EPISODE.,"The Tukas, and the lances of Salore,"
2483,AN EPISODE.,And those from Attruck and the Caspian sands;
2484,AN EPISODE.,"Light men and on light steeds, who only drink"
2485,AN EPISODE.,"The acrid milk of camels, and their wells."
2486,AN EPISODE.,"And then a swarm of wandering horse, who came"
2487,AN EPISODE.,"From far, and a more doubtful service owned,--"
2488,AN EPISODE.,"The Tartars of Ferghana, from the banks"
2489,AN EPISODE.,"Of the Jaxartes, men with scanty beards"
2490,AN EPISODE.,And close-set skull-caps; and those wilder hordes
2491,AN EPISODE.,"Who roam o’er Kipchak and the northern waste,"
2492,AN EPISODE.,"Kalmucks and unkempt Kuzzaks, tribes who stray"
2493,AN EPISODE.,"Nearest the Pole, and wandering Kirghizzes,"
2494,AN EPISODE.,"Who come on shaggy ponies from Pamere,--"
2495,AN EPISODE.,These all filed out from camp into the plain.
2496,AN EPISODE.,"And on the other side the Persians formed,--"
2497,AN EPISODE.,"First a light cloud of horse, Tartars they seemed,"
2498,AN EPISODE.,"The Ilyats of Khorassan; and behind,"
2499,AN EPISODE.,"The royal troops of Persia, horse and foot,"
2500,AN EPISODE.,Marshalled battalions bright in burnished steel.
2501,AN EPISODE.,"But Peran-Wisa with his herald came,"
2502,AN EPISODE.,"Threading the Tartar squadrons to the front,"
2503,AN EPISODE.,And with his staff kept back the foremost ranks.
2504,AN EPISODE.,"And when Ferood, who led the Persians, saw"
2505,AN EPISODE.,"That Peran-Wisa kept the Tartars back,"
2506,AN EPISODE.,"He took his spear, and to the front he came,"
2507,AN EPISODE.,"And checked his ranks, and fixed them where they stood."
2508,AN EPISODE.,And the old Tartar came upon the sand
2509,AN EPISODE.,"Betwixt the silent hosts, and spake, and said,--"
2510,AN EPISODE.,"“Ferood, and ye, Persians and Tartars, hear!"
2511,AN EPISODE.,Let there be truce between the hosts to-day.
2512,AN EPISODE.,But choose a champion from the Persian lords
2513,AN EPISODE.,"To fight our champion Sohrab, man to man.”"
2514,AN EPISODE.,"As in the country, on a morn in June,"
2515,AN EPISODE.,"When the dew glistens on the pearled ears,"
2516,AN EPISODE.,"A shiver runs through the deep corn for joy,--"
2517,AN EPISODE.,"So, when they heard what Peran-Wisa said,"
2518,AN EPISODE.,A thrill through all the Tartar squadrons ran
2519,AN EPISODE.,"Of pride and hope for Sohrab, whom they loved."
2520,AN EPISODE.,But as a troop of pedlers from Cabool
2521,AN EPISODE.,"Cross underneath the Indian Caucasus,"
2522,AN EPISODE.,That vast sky-neighboring mountain of milk snow;
2523,AN EPISODE.,"Crossing so high, that, as they mount, they pass"
2524,AN EPISODE.,"Long flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow,"
2525,AN EPISODE.,"Choked by the air, and scarce can they themselves"
2526,AN EPISODE.,Slake their parched throats with sugared mulberries;
2527,AN EPISODE.,"In single file they move, and stop their breath,"
2528,AN EPISODE.,"For fear they should dislodge the o’erhanging snows,--"
2529,AN EPISODE.,So the pale Persians held their breath with fear.
2530,AN EPISODE.,And to Ferood his brother chiefs came up
2531,AN EPISODE.,"To counsel; Gudurz and Zoarrah came,"
2532,AN EPISODE.,"And Feraburz, who ruled the Persian host"
2533,AN EPISODE.,"Second, and was the uncle of the king;"
2534,AN EPISODE.,"These came and counselled, and then Gudurz said,--"
2535,AN EPISODE.,"“Ferood, shame bids us take their challenge up,"
2536,AN EPISODE.,Yet champion have we none to match this youth.
2537,AN EPISODE.,"He has the wild stag’s foot, the lion’s heart."
2538,AN EPISODE.,But Rustum came last night; aloof he sits
2539,AN EPISODE.,"And sullen, and has pitched his tents apart."
2540,AN EPISODE.,"Him will I seek, and carry to his ear"
2541,AN EPISODE.,"The Tartar challenge, and this young man’s name;"
2542,AN EPISODE.,"Haply he will forget his wrath, and fight."
2543,AN EPISODE.,"Stand forth the while, and take their challenge up.”"
2544,AN EPISODE.,"So spake he; and Ferood stood forth and cried,--"
2545,AN EPISODE.,"“Old man, be it agreed as thou hast said!"
2546,AN EPISODE.,"Let Sohrab arm, and we will find a man.”"
2547,AN EPISODE.,"He spake; and Peran-Wisa turned, and strode"
2548,AN EPISODE.,Back through the opening squadrons to his tent.
2549,AN EPISODE.,"But through the anxious Persians Gudurz ran,"
2550,AN EPISODE.,"And crossed the camp which lay behind, and reached,"
2551,AN EPISODE.,"Out on the sands beyond it, Rustum’s tents."
2552,AN EPISODE.,"Of scarlet cloth they were, and glittering gay,"
2553,AN EPISODE.,Just pitched; the high pavilion in the midst
2554,AN EPISODE.,"Was Rustum’s, and his men lay camped around."
2555,AN EPISODE.,"And Gudurz entered Rustum’s tent, and found"
2556,AN EPISODE.,"Rustum; his morning meal was done, but still"
2557,AN EPISODE.,"The table stood before him, charged with food,--"
2558,AN EPISODE.,"A side of roasted sheep, and cakes of bread,"
2559,AN EPISODE.,And dark-green melons; and there Rustum sate
2560,AN EPISODE.,"Listless, and held a falcon on his wrist,"
2561,AN EPISODE.,And played with it; but Gudurz came and stood
2562,AN EPISODE.,"Before him; and he looked, and saw him stand,"
2563,AN EPISODE.,"And with a cry sprang up, and dropped the bird,"
2564,AN EPISODE.,"And greeted Gudurz with both hands, and said,--"
2565,AN EPISODE.,“Welcome! these eyes could see no better sight.
2566,AN EPISODE.,"What news? but sit down first, and eat and drink.”"
2567,AN EPISODE.,"But Gudurz stood in the tent-door, and said,--"
2568,AN EPISODE.,"“Not now. A time will come to eat and drink,"
2569,AN EPISODE.,But not to-day: to-day has other needs.
2570,AN EPISODE.,"The armies are drawn out, and stand at gaze;"
2571,AN EPISODE.,"For, from the Tartars is a challenge brought"
2572,AN EPISODE.,To pick a champion from the Persian lords
2573,AN EPISODE.,To fight their champion--and thou know’st his name:
2574,AN EPISODE.,"Sohrab men call him, but his birth is hid."
2575,AN EPISODE.,"O Rustum, like thy might is this young man’s!"
2576,AN EPISODE.,"He has the wild stag’s foot, the lion’s heart;"
2577,AN EPISODE.,"And he is young, and Iran’s chiefs are old,"
2578,AN EPISODE.,Or else too weak; and all eyes turn to thee.
2579,AN EPISODE.,"Come down and help us, Rustum, or we lose!”"
2580,AN EPISODE.,"He spoke; but Rustum answered with a smile,--"
2581,AN EPISODE.,"“Go to! if Iran’s chiefs are old, then I"
2582,AN EPISODE.,"Am older. If the young are weak, the king"
2583,AN EPISODE.,"Errs strangely; for the king, for Kai Khosroo,"
2584,AN EPISODE.,"Himself is young, and honors younger men,"
2585,AN EPISODE.,And lets the aged moulder to their graves.
2586,AN EPISODE.,"Rustum he loves no more, but loves the young:"
2587,AN EPISODE.,"The young may rise at Sohrab’s vaunts, not I."
2588,AN EPISODE.,"For what care I, though all speak Sohrab’s fame?"
2589,AN EPISODE.,"For would that I myself had such a son,"
2590,AN EPISODE.,And not that one slight helpless girl I have!--
2591,AN EPISODE.,"A son so famed, so brave, to send to war,"
2592,AN EPISODE.,"And I to tarry with the snow-haired Zal,"
2593,AN EPISODE.,"My father, whom the robber Afghans vex,"
2594,AN EPISODE.,"And clip his borders short, and drive his herds,"
2595,AN EPISODE.,And he has none to guard his weak old age.
2596,AN EPISODE.,"There would I go, and hang my armor up,"
2597,AN EPISODE.,"And with my great name fence that weak old man,"
2598,AN EPISODE.,"And spend the goodly treasures I have got,"
2599,AN EPISODE.,"And rest my age, and hear of Sohrab’s fame,"
2600,AN EPISODE.,"And leave to death the hosts of thankless kings,"
2601,AN EPISODE.,And with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more.”
2602,AN EPISODE.,"He spoke, and smiled; and Gudurz made reply,--"
2603,AN EPISODE.,"“What then, O Rustum, will men say to this,"
2604,AN EPISODE.,"When Sohrab dares our bravest forth, and seeks"
2605,AN EPISODE.,"Thee most of all, and thou, whom most he seeks,"
2606,AN EPISODE.,"Hidest thy face? Take heed lest men should say,--"
2607,AN EPISODE.,"_Like some old miser, Rustum hoards his fame,_"
2608,AN EPISODE.,_And shuns to peril it with younger men_.”
2609,AN EPISODE.,"And, greatly moved, then Rustum made reply,--"
2610,AN EPISODE.,"“O Gudurz, wherefore dost thou say such words?"
2611,AN EPISODE.,Thou knowest better words than this to say.
2612,AN EPISODE.,"What is one more, one less, obscure or famed,"
2613,AN EPISODE.,"Valiant or craven, young or old, to me?"
2614,AN EPISODE.,Are not they mortal? am not I myself?
2615,AN EPISODE.,But who for men of naught would do great deeds?
2616,AN EPISODE.,"Come, thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his fame!"
2617,AN EPISODE.,"But I will fight unknown, and in plain arms:"
2618,AN EPISODE.,"Let not men say of Rustum, he was matched"
2619,AN EPISODE.,In single fight with any mortal man.”
2620,AN EPISODE.,"He spoke, and frowned; and Gudurz turned, and ran"
2621,AN EPISODE.,"Back quickly through the camp in fear and joy,--"
2622,AN EPISODE.,"Fear at his wrath, but joy that Rustum came."
2623,AN EPISODE.,"But Rustum strode to his tent-door, and called"
2624,AN EPISODE.,"His followers in, and bade them bring his arms,"
2625,AN EPISODE.,And clad himself in steel. The arms he chose
2626,AN EPISODE.,"Were plain, and on his shield was no device;"
2627,AN EPISODE.,"Only his helm was rich, inlaid with gold,"
2628,AN EPISODE.,"And, from the fluted spine a-top, a plume"
2629,AN EPISODE.,"Of horse-hair waved, a scarlet horse-hair plume."
2630,AN EPISODE.,"So armed, he issued forth; and Ruksh, his horse,"
2631,AN EPISODE.,"Followed him like a faithful hound at heel,--"
2632,AN EPISODE.,"Ruksh, whose renown was noised through all the earth,"
2633,AN EPISODE.,The horse whom Rustum on a foray once
2634,AN EPISODE.,Did in Bokhara by the river find
2635,AN EPISODE.,"A colt beneath its dam, and drove him home,"
2636,AN EPISODE.,"And reared him; a bright bay, with lofty crest,"
2637,AN EPISODE.,Dight with a saddle-cloth of broidered green
2638,AN EPISODE.,"Crusted with gold, and on the ground were worked"
2639,AN EPISODE.,"All beasts of chase, all beasts which hunters know."
2640,AN EPISODE.,"So followed, Rustum left his tents, and crossed"
2641,AN EPISODE.,"The camp, and to the Persian host appeared."
2642,AN EPISODE.,"And all the Persians knew him, and with shouts"
2643,AN EPISODE.,Hailed; but the Tartars knew not who he was.
2644,AN EPISODE.,And dear as the wet diver to the eyes
2645,AN EPISODE.,"Of his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore,"
2646,AN EPISODE.,"By sandy Bahrein, in the Persian Gulf,"
2647,AN EPISODE.,"Plunging all day in the blue waves, at night,"
2648,AN EPISODE.,"Having made up his tale of precious pearls,"
2649,AN EPISODE.,"Rejoins her in their hut upon the sands,--"
2650,AN EPISODE.,So dear to the pale Persians Rustum came.
2651,AN EPISODE.,And Rustum to the Persian front advanced;
2652,AN EPISODE.,"And Sohrab armed in Haman’s tent, and came."
2653,AN EPISODE.,And as a-field the reapers cut a swath
2654,AN EPISODE.,"Down through the middle of a rich man’s corn,"
2655,AN EPISODE.,"And on each side are squares of standing corn,"
2656,AN EPISODE.,"And in the midst a stubble short and bare,--"
2657,AN EPISODE.,"So on each side were squares of men, with spears"
2658,AN EPISODE.,"Bristling, and in the midst the open sand."
2659,AN EPISODE.,"And Rustum came upon the sand, and cast"
2660,AN EPISODE.,"His eyes toward the Tartar tents, and saw"
2661,AN EPISODE.,"Sohrab come forth, and eyed him as he came."
2662,AN EPISODE.,"As some rich woman, on a winter’s morn,"
2663,AN EPISODE.,Eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge
2664,AN EPISODE.,"Who with numb blackened fingers makes her fire,--"
2665,AN EPISODE.,"At cock-crow, on a starlit winter’s morn,"
2666,AN EPISODE.,"When the frost flowers the whitened window-panes,--"
2667,AN EPISODE.,"And wonders how she lives, and what the thoughts"
2668,AN EPISODE.,Of that poor drudge may be; so Rustum eyed
2669,AN EPISODE.,"The unknown adventurous youth, who from afar"
2670,AN EPISODE.,"Came seeking Rustum, and defying forth"
2671,AN EPISODE.,All the most valiant chiefs; long he perused
2672,AN EPISODE.,"His spirited air, and wondered who he was."
2673,AN EPISODE.,"For very young he seemed, tenderly reared;"
2674,AN EPISODE.,"Like some young cypress, tall and dark and straight,"
2675,AN EPISODE.,Which in a queen’s secluded garden throws
2676,AN EPISODE.,"Its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf,"
2677,AN EPISODE.,"By midnight, to a bubbling fountain’s sound,--"
2678,AN EPISODE.,"So slender Sohrab seemed, so softly reared."
2679,AN EPISODE.,And a deep pity entered Rustum’s soul
2680,AN EPISODE.,"As he beheld him coming; and he stood,"
2681,AN EPISODE.,"And beckoned to him with his hand, and said,--"
2682,AN EPISODE.,"“O thou young man, the air of heaven is soft,"
2683,AN EPISODE.,"And warm, and pleasant; but the grave is cold!"
2684,AN EPISODE.,Heaven’s air is better than the cold dead grave.
2685,AN EPISODE.,"Behold me! I am vast, and clad in iron,"
2686,AN EPISODE.,And tried; and I have stood on many a field
2687,AN EPISODE.,"Of blood, and I have fought with many a foe:"
2688,AN EPISODE.,"Never was that field lost, or that foe saved."
2689,AN EPISODE.,"O Sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on death?"
2690,AN EPISODE.,"Be governed: quit the Tartar host, and come"
2691,AN EPISODE.,"To Iran, and be as my son to me,"
2692,AN EPISODE.,And fight beneath my banner till I die!
2693,AN EPISODE.,There are no youths in Iran brave as thou.”
2694,AN EPISODE.,"So he spake, mildly. Sohrab heard his voice,"
2695,AN EPISODE.,"The mighty voice of Rustum, and he saw"
2696,AN EPISODE.,"His giant figure planted on the sand,"
2697,AN EPISODE.,"Sole, like some single tower, which a chief"
2698,AN EPISODE.,Hath builded on the waste in former years
2699,AN EPISODE.,"Against the robbers; and he saw that head,"
2700,AN EPISODE.,"Streaked with its first gray hairs; hope filled his soul,"
2701,AN EPISODE.,"And he ran forward, and embraced his knees,"
2702,AN EPISODE.,"And clasped his hand within his own, and said,--"
2703,AN EPISODE.,"“Oh, by thy father’s head! by thine own soul!"
2704,AN EPISODE.,Art thou not Rustum? Speak! art thou not he?”
2705,AN EPISODE.,"But Rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth,"
2706,AN EPISODE.,"And turned away, and spake to his own soul,--"
2707,AN EPISODE.,“Ah me! I muse what this young fox may mean!
2708,AN EPISODE.,"False, wily, boastful, are these Tartar boys."
2709,AN EPISODE.,"For if I now confess this thing he asks,"
2710,AN EPISODE.,"And hide it not, but say, _Rustum is here!_"
2711,AN EPISODE.,"He will not yield indeed, nor quit our foes;"
2712,AN EPISODE.,"But he will find some pretext not to fight,"
2713,AN EPISODE.,"And praise my fame, and proffer courteous gifts,"
2714,AN EPISODE.,"A belt or sword perhaps, and go his way."
2715,AN EPISODE.,"And on a feast-tide, in Afrasiab’s hall"
2716,AN EPISODE.,"In Samarcand, he will arise and cry,--"
2717,AN EPISODE.,"‘I challenged once, when the two armies camped"
2718,AN EPISODE.,"Beside the Oxus, all the Persian lords"
2719,AN EPISODE.,To cope with me in single fight; but they
2720,AN EPISODE.,"Shrank, only Rustum dared; then he and I"
2721,AN EPISODE.,"Changed gifts, and went on equal terms away.’"
2722,AN EPISODE.,"So will he speak, perhaps, while men applaud;"
2723,AN EPISODE.,Then were the chiefs of Iran shamed through me.”
2724,AN EPISODE.,"And then he turned, and sternly spake aloud,--"
2725,AN EPISODE.,“Rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus
2726,AN EPISODE.,"Of Rustum? I am here, whom thou hast called"
2727,AN EPISODE.,"By challenge forth; make good thy vaunt, or yield!"
2728,AN EPISODE.,Is it with Rustum only thou wouldst fight?
2729,AN EPISODE.,"Rash boy, men look on Rustum’s face, and flee!"
2730,AN EPISODE.,"For well I know, that did great Rustum stand"
2731,AN EPISODE.,"Before thy face this day, and were revealed,"
2732,AN EPISODE.,There would be then no talk of fighting more.
2733,AN EPISODE.,"But being what I am, I tell thee this,--"
2734,AN EPISODE.,Do thou record it in thine inmost soul:
2735,AN EPISODE.,"Either thou shalt renounce thy vaunt, and yield,"
2736,AN EPISODE.,"Or else thy bones shall strew this sand, till winds"
2737,AN EPISODE.,"Bleach them, or Oxus with his summer-floods,"
2738,AN EPISODE.,Oxus in summer wash them all away.”
2739,AN EPISODE.,"He spoke; and Sohrab answered, on his feet,--"
2740,AN EPISODE.,“Art thou so fierce? Thou wilt not fight me so!
2741,AN EPISODE.,"I am no girl, to be made pale by words."
2742,AN EPISODE.,"Yet this thou hast said well, did Rustum stand"
2743,AN EPISODE.,"Here on this field, there were no fighting then."
2744,AN EPISODE.,"But Rustum is far hence, and we stand here."
2745,AN EPISODE.,"Begin! thou art more vast, more dread than I;"
2746,AN EPISODE.,"And thou art proved, I know, and I am young--"
2747,AN EPISODE.,But yet success sways with the breath of Heaven.
2748,AN EPISODE.,And though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure
2749,AN EPISODE.,"Thy victory, yet thou canst not surely know."
2750,AN EPISODE.,"For we are all, like swimmers in the sea,"
2751,AN EPISODE.,"Poised on the top of a huge wave of fate,"
2752,AN EPISODE.,Which hangs uncertain to which side to fall;
2753,AN EPISODE.,"And whether it will heave us up to land,"
2754,AN EPISODE.,"Or whether it will roll us out to sea,--"
2755,AN EPISODE.,"Back out to sea, to the deep waves of death,--"
2756,AN EPISODE.,"We know not, and no search will make us know:"
2757,AN EPISODE.,Only the event will teach us in its hour.”
2758,AN EPISODE.,"He spoke; and Rustum answered not, but hurled"
2759,AN EPISODE.,"His spear: down from the shoulder, down it came,"
2760,AN EPISODE.,"As on some partridge in the corn a hawk,"
2761,AN EPISODE.,"That long has towered in the airy clouds,"
2762,AN EPISODE.,"Drops like a plummet; Sohrab saw it come,"
2763,AN EPISODE.,"And sprang aside, quick as a flash; the spear"
2764,AN EPISODE.,"Hissed, and went quivering down into the sand,"
2765,AN EPISODE.,Which it sent flying wide. Then Sohrab threw
2766,AN EPISODE.,"In turn, and full struck Rustum’s shield; sharp rang,"
2767,AN EPISODE.,"The iron plates rang sharp, but turned the spear."
2768,AN EPISODE.,"And Rustum seized his club, which none but he"
2769,AN EPISODE.,"Could wield; an unlopped trunk it was, and huge,"
2770,AN EPISODE.,"Still rough,--like those which men in treeless plains"
2771,AN EPISODE.,"To build them boats fish from the flooded rivers,"
2772,AN EPISODE.,"Hyphasis or Hydaspes, when, high up"
2773,AN EPISODE.,"By their dark springs, the wind in winter-time"
2774,AN EPISODE.,"Hath made in Himalayan forests wrack,"
2775,AN EPISODE.,"And strewn the channels with torn boughs,--so huge"
2776,AN EPISODE.,"The club which Rustum lifted now, and struck"
2777,AN EPISODE.,"One stroke; but again Sohrab sprang aside,"
2778,AN EPISODE.,"Lithe as the glancing snake, and the club came"
2779,AN EPISODE.,"Thundering to earth, and leapt from Rustum’s hand."
2780,AN EPISODE.,"And Rustum followed his own blow, and fell"
2781,AN EPISODE.,"To his knees, and with his fingers clutched the sand."
2782,AN EPISODE.,"And now might Sohrab have unsheathed his sword,"
2783,AN EPISODE.,And pierced the mighty Rustum while he lay
2784,AN EPISODE.,"Dizzy, and on his knees, and choked with sand;"
2785,AN EPISODE.,"But he looked on, and smiled, nor bared his sword,"
2786,AN EPISODE.,"But courteously drew back, and spoke, and said,--"
2787,AN EPISODE.,“Thou strik’st too hard! that club of thine will float
2788,AN EPISODE.,"Upon the summer-floods, and not my bones."
2789,AN EPISODE.,"But rise, and be not wroth! not wroth am I;"
2790,AN EPISODE.,"No, when I see thee, wrath forsakes my soul."
2791,AN EPISODE.,Thou say’st thou art not Rustum; be it so!
2792,AN EPISODE.,"Who art thou, then, that canst so touch my soul?"
2793,AN EPISODE.,"Boy as I am, I have seen battles too,--"
2794,AN EPISODE.,"Have waded foremost in their bloody waves,"
2795,AN EPISODE.,And heard their hollow roar of dying men;
2796,AN EPISODE.,But never was my heart thus touched before.
2797,AN EPISODE.,"Are they from Heaven, these softenings of the heart?"
2798,AN EPISODE.,"O thou old warrior, let us yield to Heaven!"
2799,AN EPISODE.,"Come, plant we here in earth our angry spears,"
2800,AN EPISODE.,"And make a truce, and sit upon this sand,"
2801,AN EPISODE.,"And pledge each other in red wine, like friends,"
2802,AN EPISODE.,And thou shalt talk to me of Rustum’s deeds.
2803,AN EPISODE.,"There are enough foes in the Persian host,"
2804,AN EPISODE.,"Whom I may meet, and strike, and feel no pang;"
2805,AN EPISODE.,"Champions enough Afrasiab has, whom thou"
2806,AN EPISODE.,"Mayst fight; fight _them_, when they confront thy spear!"
2807,AN EPISODE.,"But oh, let there be peace ’twixt thee and me!”"
2808,AN EPISODE.,"He ceased; but while he spake, Rustum had risen,"
2809,AN EPISODE.,"And stood erect, trembling with rage; his club"
2810,AN EPISODE.,"He left to lie, but had regained his spear,"
2811,AN EPISODE.,Whose fiery point now in his mailed right hand
2812,AN EPISODE.,"Blazed bright and baleful, like that autumn-star,"
2813,AN EPISODE.,The baleful sign of fevers; dust had soiled
2814,AN EPISODE.,"His stately crest, and dimmed his glittering arms."
2815,AN EPISODE.,"His breast heaved, his lips foamed, and twice his voice"
2816,AN EPISODE.,Was choked with rage; at last these words broke way:--
2817,AN EPISODE.,"“Girl! nimble with thy feet, not with thy hands!"
2818,AN EPISODE.,"Curled minion, dancer, coiner of sweet words!"
2819,AN EPISODE.,"Fight, let me hear thy hateful voice no more!"
2820,AN EPISODE.,Thou art not in Afrasiab’s gardens now
2821,AN EPISODE.,"With Tartar girls, with whom thou art wont to dance;"
2822,AN EPISODE.,"But on the Oxus-sands, and in the dance"
2823,AN EPISODE.,"Of battle, and with me, who make no play"
2824,AN EPISODE.,"Of war: I fight it out, and hand to hand."
2825,AN EPISODE.,"Speak not to me of truce, and pledge, and wine!"
2826,AN EPISODE.,Remember all thy valor; try thy feints
2827,AN EPISODE.,"And cunning! all the pity I had is gone,"
2828,AN EPISODE.,Because thou hast shamed me before both the hosts
2829,AN EPISODE.,With thy light skipping tricks and thy girl’s wiles.”
2830,AN EPISODE.,"He spoke; and Sohrab kindled at his taunts,"
2831,AN EPISODE.,And he too drew his sword; at once they rushed
2832,AN EPISODE.,"Together, as two eagles on one prey"
2833,AN EPISODE.,"Come rushing down together from the clouds,"
2834,AN EPISODE.,"One from the east, one from the west; their shields"
2835,AN EPISODE.,"Dashed with a clang together, and a din"
2836,AN EPISODE.,"Rose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters"
2837,AN EPISODE.,"Make often in the forest’s heart at morn,"
2838,AN EPISODE.,"Of hewing axes, crashing trees,--such blows"
2839,AN EPISODE.,Rustum and Sohrab on each other hailed.
2840,AN EPISODE.,And you would say that sun and stars took part
2841,AN EPISODE.,In that unnatural conflict: for a cloud
2842,AN EPISODE.,"Grew suddenly in heaven, and darked the sun"
2843,AN EPISODE.,Over the fighters’ heads; and a wind rose
2844,AN EPISODE.,"Under their feet, and moaning swept the plain,"
2845,AN EPISODE.,And in a sandy whirlwind wrapped the pair.
2846,AN EPISODE.,"In gloom they twain were wrapped, and they alone;"
2847,AN EPISODE.,For both the on-looking hosts on either hand
2848,AN EPISODE.,"Stood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure,"
2849,AN EPISODE.,And the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream.
2850,AN EPISODE.,"But in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes"
2851,AN EPISODE.,And laboring breath. First Rustum struck the shield
2852,AN EPISODE.,Which Sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear
2853,AN EPISODE.,"Rent the tough plates, but failed to reach the skin,"
2854,AN EPISODE.,And Rustum plucked it back with angry groan.
2855,AN EPISODE.,"Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum’s helm,"
2856,AN EPISODE.,Nor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest
2857,AN EPISODE.,"He shore away, and that proud horse-hair plume,"
2858,AN EPISODE.,"Never till now defiled, sank to the dust;"
2859,AN EPISODE.,And Rustum bowed his head. But then the gloom
2860,AN EPISODE.,"Grew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air,"
2861,AN EPISODE.,"And lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh the horse,"
2862,AN EPISODE.,"Who stood at hand, uttered a dreadful cry:"
2863,AN EPISODE.,"No horse’s cry was that, most like the roar"
2864,AN EPISODE.,"Of some pained desert-lion, who all day"
2865,AN EPISODE.,"Has trailed the hunter’s javelin in his side,"
2866,AN EPISODE.,And comes at night to die upon the sand;
2867,AN EPISODE.,"The two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for fear,"
2868,AN EPISODE.,And Oxus curdled as it crossed his stream.
2869,AN EPISODE.,"But Sohrab heard, and quailed not, but rushed on,"
2870,AN EPISODE.,And struck again; and again Rustum bowed
2871,AN EPISODE.,"His head; but this time all the blade, like glass,"
2872,AN EPISODE.,"Sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm,"
2873,AN EPISODE.,And in the hand the hilt remained alone.
2874,AN EPISODE.,Then Rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes
2875,AN EPISODE.,"Glared, and he shook on high his menacing spear,"
2876,AN EPISODE.,"And shouted, _Rustum_! Sohrab heard that shout,"
2877,AN EPISODE.,"And shrank amazed: back he recoiled one step,"
2878,AN EPISODE.,And scanned with blinking eyes the advancing form;
2879,AN EPISODE.,"And then he stood bewildered, and he dropped"
2880,AN EPISODE.,"His covering shield, and the spear pierced his side."
2881,AN EPISODE.,"He reeled, and staggering back sank to the ground."
2882,AN EPISODE.,"And then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell,"
2883,AN EPISODE.,"And the bright sun broke forth, and melted all"
2884,AN EPISODE.,"The cloud; and the two armies saw the pair,--"
2885,AN EPISODE.,"Saw Rustum standing safe upon his feet,"
2886,AN EPISODE.,And Sohrab wounded on the bloody sand.
2887,AN EPISODE.,"Then, with a bitter smile, Rustum began,--"
2888,AN EPISODE.,"“Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill"
2889,AN EPISODE.,"A Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse,"
2890,AN EPISODE.,And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab’s tent;
2891,AN EPISODE.,Or else that the great Rustum would come down
2892,AN EPISODE.,"Himself to fight, and that thy wiles would move"
2893,AN EPISODE.,"His heart to take a gift, and let thee go."
2894,AN EPISODE.,And then that all the Tartar host would praise
2895,AN EPISODE.,"Thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame,"
2896,AN EPISODE.,To glad thy father in his weak old age.
2897,AN EPISODE.,"Fool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man!"
2898,AN EPISODE.,Dearer to the red jackals shalt thou be
2899,AN EPISODE.,"Than to thy friends, and to thy father old.”"
2900,AN EPISODE.,"And, with a fearless mien, Sohrab replied,--"
2901,AN EPISODE.,"“Unknown thou art, yet thy fierce vaunt is vain."
2902,AN EPISODE.,"Thou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man!"
2903,AN EPISODE.,"No! Rustum slays me, and this filial heart."
2904,AN EPISODE.,"For, were I matched with ten such men as thee,"
2905,AN EPISODE.,"And I were that which till to-day I was,"
2906,AN EPISODE.,"They should be lying here, I standing there."
2907,AN EPISODE.,"But that belovèd name unnerved my arm,--"
2908,AN EPISODE.,"That name, and something, I confess, in thee,"
2909,AN EPISODE.,"Which troubles all my heart, and made my shield"
2910,AN EPISODE.,Fall; and thy spear transfixed an unarmed foe.
2911,AN EPISODE.,"And now thou boastest, and insult’st my fate."
2912,AN EPISODE.,"But hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear:"
2913,AN EPISODE.,The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!
2914,AN EPISODE.,"My father, whom I seek through all the world,"
2915,AN EPISODE.,"He shall avenge my death, and punish thee!”"
2916,AN EPISODE.,As when some hunter in the spring hath found
2917,AN EPISODE.,"A breeding eagle sitting on her nest,"
2918,AN EPISODE.,"Upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake,"
2919,AN EPISODE.,"And pierced her with an arrow as she rose,"
2920,AN EPISODE.,And followed her to find her where she fell
2921,AN EPISODE.,Far off; anon her mate comes winging back
2922,AN EPISODE.,"From hunting, and a great way off descries"
2923,AN EPISODE.,"His huddling young left sole; at that, he checks"
2924,AN EPISODE.,"His pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps"
2925,AN EPISODE.,"Circles above his eyry, with loud screams"
2926,AN EPISODE.,Chiding his mate back to her nest; but she
2927,AN EPISODE.,"Lies dying, with the arrow in her side,"
2928,AN EPISODE.,"In some far stony gorge out of his ken,"
2929,AN EPISODE.,"A heap of fluttering feathers,--never more"
2930,AN EPISODE.,"Shall the lake glass her, flying over it;"
2931,AN EPISODE.,Never the black and dripping precipices
2932,AN EPISODE.,"Echo her stormy scream as she sails by,--"
2933,AN EPISODE.,"As that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss,"
2934,AN EPISODE.,"So Rustum knew not his own loss, but stood"
2935,AN EPISODE.,"Over his dying son, and knew him not."
2936,AN EPISODE.,"And with a cold, incredulous voice, he said,--"
2937,AN EPISODE.,“What prate is this of fathers and revenge?
2938,AN EPISODE.,The mighty Rustum never had a son.”
2939,AN EPISODE.,"And, with a failing voice, Sohrab replied,--"
2940,AN EPISODE.,"“Ah, yes, he had! and that lost son am I."
2941,AN EPISODE.,"Surely the news will one day reach his ear,--"
2942,AN EPISODE.,"Reach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries long,"
2943,AN EPISODE.,"Somewhere, I know not where, but far from here;"
2944,AN EPISODE.,"And pierce him like a stab, and make him leap"
2945,AN EPISODE.,"To arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee."
2946,AN EPISODE.,"Fierce man, bethink thee, for an only son!"
2947,AN EPISODE.,"What will that grief, what will that vengeance, be?"
2948,AN EPISODE.,"Oh, could I live till I that grief had seen!"
2949,AN EPISODE.,"Yet him I pity not so much, but her,"
2950,AN EPISODE.,"My mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells"
2951,AN EPISODE.,"With that old king, her father, who grows gray"
2952,AN EPISODE.,"With age, and rules over the valiant Koords."
2953,AN EPISODE.,"Her most I pity, who no more will see"
2954,AN EPISODE.,"Sohrab returning from the Tartar camp,"
2955,AN EPISODE.,"With spoils and honor, when the war is done."
2956,AN EPISODE.,"But a dark rumor will be bruited up,"
2957,AN EPISODE.,"From tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear;"
2958,AN EPISODE.,And then will that defenceless woman learn
2959,AN EPISODE.,That Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more;
2960,AN EPISODE.,"But that in battle with a nameless foe,"
2961,AN EPISODE.,"By the far-distant Oxus, he is slain.”"
2962,AN EPISODE.,"He spoke; and as he ceased, he wept aloud,"
2963,AN EPISODE.,"Thinking of her he left, and his own death."
2964,AN EPISODE.,"He spoke; but Rustum listened, plunged in thought."
2965,AN EPISODE.,Nor did he yet believe it was his son
2966,AN EPISODE.,"Who spoke, although he called back names he knew;"
2967,AN EPISODE.,For he had had sure tidings that the babe
2968,AN EPISODE.,Which was in Ader-baijan born to him
2969,AN EPISODE.,"Had been a puny girl, no boy at all--"
2970,AN EPISODE.,"So that sad mother sent him word, for fear"
2971,AN EPISODE.,"Rustum should seek the boy, to train in arms."
2972,AN EPISODE.,"And so he deemed that either Sohrab took,"
2973,AN EPISODE.,"By a false boast, the style of Rustum’s son;"
2974,AN EPISODE.,"Or that men gave it him, to swell his fame."
2975,AN EPISODE.,"So deemed he: yet he listened, plunged in thought;"
2976,AN EPISODE.,"And his soul set to grief, as the vast tide"
2977,AN EPISODE.,Of the bright rocking ocean sets to shore
2978,AN EPISODE.,At the full moon; tears gathered in his eyes;
2979,AN EPISODE.,"For he remembered his own early youth,"
2980,AN EPISODE.,"And all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn,"
2981,AN EPISODE.,The shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries
2982,AN EPISODE.,"A far, bright city, smitten by the sun,"
2983,AN EPISODE.,"Through many rolling clouds,--so Rustum saw"
2984,AN EPISODE.,His youth; saw Sohrab’s mother in her bloom;
2985,AN EPISODE.,"And that old king, her father, who loved well"
2986,AN EPISODE.,"His wandering guest, and gave him his fair child"
2987,AN EPISODE.,"With joy; and all the pleasant life they led,"
2988,AN EPISODE.,"They three, in that long-distant summer-time,--"
2989,AN EPISODE.,"The castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt"
2990,AN EPISODE.,"And hound, and morn on those delightful hills"
2991,AN EPISODE.,"In Ader-baijan. And he saw that youth,"
2992,AN EPISODE.,"Of age and looks to be his own dear son,"
2993,AN EPISODE.,"Piteous and lovely, lying on the sand;"
2994,AN EPISODE.,Like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe
2995,AN EPISODE.,"Of an unskilful gardener has been cut,"
2996,AN EPISODE.,"Mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed,"
2997,AN EPISODE.,"And lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom,"
2998,AN EPISODE.,"On the mown, dying grass,--so Sohrab lay,"
2999,AN EPISODE.,"Lovely in death, upon the common sand."
3000,AN EPISODE.,"And Rustum gazed on him with grief, and said,--"
3001,AN EPISODE.,"“O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son"
3002,AN EPISODE.,"Whom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved!"
3003,AN EPISODE.,"Yet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else men"
3004,AN EPISODE.,Have told thee false: thou art not Rustum’s son.
3005,AN EPISODE.,"For Rustum had no son: one child he had,--"
3006,AN EPISODE.,"But one,--a girl; who with her mother now"
3007,AN EPISODE.,"Plies some light female task, nor dreams of us,--"
3008,AN EPISODE.,"Of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war.”"
3009,AN EPISODE.,But Sohrab answered him in wrath; for now
3010,AN EPISODE.,"The anguish of the deep-fixed spear grew fierce,"
3011,AN EPISODE.,"And he desired to draw forth the steel,"
3012,AN EPISODE.,"And let the blood flow free, and so to die."
3013,AN EPISODE.,But first he would convince his stubborn foe;
3014,AN EPISODE.,"And, rising sternly on one arm, he said,--"
3015,AN EPISODE.,"“Man, who art thou who dost deny my words?"
3016,AN EPISODE.,Truth sits upon the lips of dying men;
3017,AN EPISODE.,"And falsehood, while I lived, was far from mine."
3018,AN EPISODE.,"I tell thee, pricked upon this arm I bear"
3019,AN EPISODE.,"That seal which Rustum to my mother gave,"
3020,AN EPISODE.,That she might prick it on the babe she bore.”
3021,AN EPISODE.,"He spoke; and all the blood left Rustum’s cheeks,"
3022,AN EPISODE.,"And his knees tottered, and he smote his hand"
3023,AN EPISODE.,"Against his breast, his heavy mailèd hand,"
3024,AN EPISODE.,That the hard iron corslet clanked aloud;
3025,AN EPISODE.,"And to his heart he pressed the other hand,"
3026,AN EPISODE.,"And in a hollow voice he spake, and said,--"
3027,AN EPISODE.,"“Sohrab, that were a proof which could not lie!"
3028,AN EPISODE.,"If thou show this, then art thou Rustum’s son.”"
3029,AN EPISODE.,"Then, with weak hasty fingers, Sohrab loosed"
3030,AN EPISODE.,"His belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm,"
3031,AN EPISODE.,And showed a sign in faint vermilion points
3032,AN EPISODE.,"Pricked; as a cunning workman, in Pekin,"
3033,AN EPISODE.,"Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase,"
3034,AN EPISODE.,"An emperor’s gift,--at early morn he paints,"
3035,AN EPISODE.,"And all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp"
3036,AN EPISODE.,"Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands,--"
3037,AN EPISODE.,So delicately pricked the sign appeared
3038,AN EPISODE.,"On Sohrab’s arm, the sign of Rustum’s seal."
3039,AN EPISODE.,"It was that griffin which of old reared Zal,"
3040,AN EPISODE.,"Rustum’s great father, whom they left to die,"
3041,AN EPISODE.,"A helpless babe, among the mountain rocks;"
3042,AN EPISODE.,"Him that kind creature found, and reared, and loved;"
3043,AN EPISODE.,Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign.
3044,AN EPISODE.,"And Sohrab bared that image on his arm,"
3045,AN EPISODE.,"And himself scanned it long with mournful eyes,"
3046,AN EPISODE.,"And then he touched it with his hand, and said,--"
3047,AN EPISODE.,“How say’st thou? Is that sign the proper sign
3048,AN EPISODE.,"Of Rustum’s son, or of some other man’s?”"
3049,AN EPISODE.,"He spoke; but Rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood"
3050,AN EPISODE.,"Speechless; and then he uttered one sharp cry,--"
3051,AN EPISODE.,_O boy--thy father!_ and his voice choked there.
3052,AN EPISODE.,"And then a dark cloud passed before his eyes,"
3053,AN EPISODE.,"And his head swam, and he sank down to earth."
3054,AN EPISODE.,"But Sohrab crawled to where he lay, and cast"
3055,AN EPISODE.,"His arms about his neck, and kissed his lips,"
3056,AN EPISODE.,"And with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks,"
3057,AN EPISODE.,Trying to call him back to life; and life
3058,AN EPISODE.,"Came back to Rustum, and he oped his eyes,"
3059,AN EPISODE.,And they stood wide with horror; and he seized
3060,AN EPISODE.,"In both his hands the dust which lay around,"
3061,AN EPISODE.,"And threw it on his head, and smirched his hair,--"
3062,AN EPISODE.,"His hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms;"
3063,AN EPISODE.,"And strong convulsive groanings shook his breast,"
3064,AN EPISODE.,"And his sobs choked him; and he clutched his sword,"
3065,AN EPISODE.,"To draw it, and forever let life out."
3066,AN EPISODE.,"But Sohrab saw his thought, and held his hands,"
3067,AN EPISODE.,"And with a soothing voice he spake, and said,--"
3068,AN EPISODE.,"“Father, forbear! for I but meet to-day"
3069,AN EPISODE.,The doom which at my birth was written down
3070,AN EPISODE.,"In Heaven, and thou art Heaven’s unconscious hand."
3071,AN EPISODE.,"Surely my heart cried out that it was thou,"
3072,AN EPISODE.,"When first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke too,"
3073,AN EPISODE.,I know it! But fate trod those promptings down
3074,AN EPISODE.,"Under its iron heel; fate, fate engaged"
3075,AN EPISODE.,"The strife, and hurled me on my father’s spear."
3076,AN EPISODE.,But let us speak no more of this. I find
3077,AN EPISODE.,"My father, let me feel that I have found!"
3078,AN EPISODE.,"Come, sit beside me on this sand, and take"
3079,AN EPISODE.,"My head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks,"
3080,AN EPISODE.,"And wash them with thy tears, and say, _My son!_"
3081,AN EPISODE.,"Quick, quick! for numbered are my sands of life,"
3082,AN EPISODE.,And swift; for like the lightning to this field
3083,AN EPISODE.,"I came, and like the wind I go away,--"
3084,AN EPISODE.,"Sudden, and swift, and like a passing wind;"
3085,AN EPISODE.,But it was writ in Heaven that this should be.”
3086,AN EPISODE.,So said he; and his voice released the heart
3087,AN EPISODE.,"Of Rustum, and his tears broke forth; he cast"
3088,AN EPISODE.,"His arms round his son’s neck, and wept aloud,"
3089,AN EPISODE.,"And kissed him. And awe fell on both the hosts,"
3090,AN EPISODE.,"When they saw Rustum’s grief; and Ruksh, the horse,"
3091,AN EPISODE.,"With his head bowing to the ground, and mane"
3092,AN EPISODE.,"Sweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe"
3093,AN EPISODE.,"First to the one, then to the other, moved"
3094,AN EPISODE.,"His head, as if inquiring what their grief"
3095,AN EPISODE.,"Might mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes,"
3096,AN EPISODE.,"The big warm tears rolled down, and caked the sand."
3097,AN EPISODE.,"But Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said,--"
3098,AN EPISODE.,"“Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet"
3099,AN EPISODE.,"Should then have rotted on their nimble joints,"
3100,AN EPISODE.,When first they bore thy master to this field!”
3101,AN EPISODE.,"But Sohrab looked upon the horse, and said,--"
3102,AN EPISODE.,"“Is this, then, Ruksh? How often, in past days,"
3103,AN EPISODE.,"My mother told me of thee, thou brave steed,"
3104,AN EPISODE.,"My terrible father’s terrible horse! and said,"
3105,AN EPISODE.,That I should one day find thy lord and thee.
3106,AN EPISODE.,"Come, let me lay my hand upon thy mane!"
3107,AN EPISODE.,"O Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than I!"
3108,AN EPISODE.,"For thou hast gone where I shall never go,"
3109,AN EPISODE.,And snuffed the breezes of my father’s home.
3110,AN EPISODE.,"And thou hast trod the sands of Seistan,"
3111,AN EPISODE.,"And seen the River of Helmund, and the Lake"
3112,AN EPISODE.,Of Zirrah; and the aged Zal himself
3113,AN EPISODE.,"Has often stroked thy neck, and given thee food,"
3114,AN EPISODE.,"Corn in a golden platter, soaked with wine,"
3115,AN EPISODE.,"And said, _O Ruksh! bear Rustum well!_ But I"
3116,AN EPISODE.,"Have never known my grandsire’s furrowed face,"
3117,AN EPISODE.,"Nor seen his lofty house in Seistan,"
3118,AN EPISODE.,Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream;
3119,AN EPISODE.,"But lodged among my father’s foes, and seen"
3120,AN EPISODE.,"Afrasiab’s cities only, Samarcand,"
3121,AN EPISODE.,"Bokhara, and lone Khiva in the waste,"
3122,AN EPISODE.,And the black Toorkmun tents; and only drunk
3123,AN EPISODE.,"The desert rivers, Moorghab and Tejend,"
3124,AN EPISODE.,"Kohik, and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep,"
3125,AN EPISODE.,"The northern Sir; and this great Oxus stream,"
3126,AN EPISODE.,"The yellow Oxus, by whose brink I die.”"
3127,AN EPISODE.,"Then, with a heavy groan, Rustum bewailed,--"
3128,AN EPISODE.,“Oh that its waves were flowing over me!
3129,AN EPISODE.,Oh that I saw its grains of yellow silt
3130,AN EPISODE.,Roll tumbling in the current o’er my head!”
3131,AN EPISODE.,"But, with a grave mild voice, Sohrab replied,--"
3132,AN EPISODE.,"“Desire not that, my father! thou must live."
3133,AN EPISODE.,"For some are born to do great deeds, and live"
3134,AN EPISODE.,"As some are born to be obscured, and die."
3135,AN EPISODE.,"Do thou the deeds I die too young to do,"
3136,AN EPISODE.,And reap a second glory in thine age;
3137,AN EPISODE.,"Thou art my father, and thy gain is mine."
3138,AN EPISODE.,But come! thou seest this great host of men
3139,AN EPISODE.,"Which follow me; I pray thee, slay not these!"
3140,AN EPISODE.,Let me entreat for them: what have they done?
3141,AN EPISODE.,"They followed me, my hope, my fame, my star."
3142,AN EPISODE.,Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace.
3143,AN EPISODE.,"But me thou must bear hence, not send with them,"
3144,AN EPISODE.,"But carry me with thee to Seistan,"
3145,AN EPISODE.,"And place me on a bed, and mourn for me,--"
3146,AN EPISODE.,"Thou, and the snow-haired Zal, and all thy friends."
3147,AN EPISODE.,"And thou must lay me in that lovely earth,"
3148,AN EPISODE.,"And heap a stately mound above my bones,"
3149,AN EPISODE.,And plant a far-seen pillar over all;
3150,AN EPISODE.,That so the passing horseman on the waste
3151,AN EPISODE.,"May see my tomb a great way off, and cry,--"
3152,AN EPISODE.,"_Sohrab, the mighty Rustum’s son, lies there,_"
3153,AN EPISODE.,_Whom his great father did in ignorance kill!_
3154,AN EPISODE.,And I be not forgotten in my grave.”
3155,AN EPISODE.,"And, with a mournful voice, Rustum replied,--"
3156,AN EPISODE.,"“Fear not! as thou hast said, Sohrab my son,"
3157,AN EPISODE.,"So shall it be; for I will burn my tents,"
3158,AN EPISODE.,"And quit the host, and bear thee hence with me,"
3159,AN EPISODE.,"And carry thee away to Seistan,"
3160,AN EPISODE.,"And place thee on a bed, and mourn for thee,"
3161,AN EPISODE.,"With the snow-headed Zal, and all my friends."
3162,AN EPISODE.,"And I will lay thee in that lovely earth,"
3163,AN EPISODE.,"And heap a stately mound above thy bones,"
3164,AN EPISODE.,"And plant a far-seen pillar over all,"
3165,AN EPISODE.,And men shall not forget thee in thy grave.
3166,AN EPISODE.,"And I will spare thy host; yea, let them go!"
3167,AN EPISODE.,Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace!
3168,AN EPISODE.,What should I do with slaying any more?
3169,AN EPISODE.,For would that all whom I have ever slain
3170,AN EPISODE.,"Might be once more alive,--my bitterest foes,"
3171,AN EPISODE.,"And they who were called champions in their time,"
3172,AN EPISODE.,"And through whose death I won that fame I have,--"
3173,AN EPISODE.,"And I were nothing but a common man,"
3174,AN EPISODE.,"A poor, mean soldier, and without renown,"
3175,AN EPISODE.,"So thou mightest live too, my son, my son!"
3176,AN EPISODE.,"Or rather would that I, even I myself,"
3177,AN EPISODE.,"Might now be lying on this bloody sand,"
3178,AN EPISODE.,"Near death, and by an ignorant stroke of thine,"
3179,AN EPISODE.,"Not thou of mine! and I might die, not thou;"
3180,AN EPISODE.,"And I, not thou, be borne to Seistan;"
3181,AN EPISODE.,"And Zal might weep above my grave, not thine;"
3182,AN EPISODE.,"And say, _O son, I weep thee not too sore,"
3183,AN EPISODE.,"For willingly, I know, thou met’st thine end!_"
3184,AN EPISODE.,"But now in blood and battles was my youth,"
3185,AN EPISODE.,"And full of blood and battles is my age,"
3186,AN EPISODE.,And I shall never end this life of blood.”
3187,AN EPISODE.,"Then, at the point of death, Sohrab replied,--"
3188,AN EPISODE.,"“A life of blood indeed, thou dreadful man!"
3189,AN EPISODE.,"But thou shalt yet have peace; only not now,"
3190,AN EPISODE.,"Not yet! but thou shalt have it on that day,"
3191,AN EPISODE.,"When thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship,"
3192,AN EPISODE.,"Thou and the other peers of Kai Khosroo,"
3193,AN EPISODE.,"Returning home over the salt blue sea,"
3194,AN EPISODE.,From laying thy dear master in his grave.”
3195,AN EPISODE.,"And Rustum gazed in Sohrab’s face, and said,--"
3196,AN EPISODE.,"“Soon be that day, my son, and deep that sea!"
3197,AN EPISODE.,"Till then, if fate so wills, let me endure.”"
3198,AN EPISODE.,"He spoke; and Sohrab smiled on him, and took"
3199,AN EPISODE.,"The spear, and drew it from his side, and eased"
3200,AN EPISODE.,His wound’s imperious anguish; but the blood
3201,AN EPISODE.,"Came welling from the open gash, and life"
3202,AN EPISODE.,Flowed with the stream; all down his cold white side
3203,AN EPISODE.,"The crimson torrent ran, dim now and soiled,"
3204,AN EPISODE.,Like the soiled tissue of white violets
3205,AN EPISODE.,"Left, freshly gathered, on their native bank,"
3206,AN EPISODE.,By children whom their nurses call with haste
3207,AN EPISODE.,"In-doors from the sun’s eye; his head drooped low,"
3208,AN EPISODE.,"His limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay,--"
3209,AN EPISODE.,"White, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps,"
3210,AN EPISODE.,"Deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame,"
3211,AN EPISODE.,"Convulsed him back to life, he opened them,"
3212,AN EPISODE.,And fixed them feebly on his father’s face;
3213,AN EPISODE.,"Till now all strength was ebbed, and from his limbs"
3214,AN EPISODE.,"Unwillingly the spirit fled away,"
3215,AN EPISODE.,"Regretting the warm mansion which it left,"
3216,AN EPISODE.,"And youth, and bloom, and this delightful world."
3217,AN EPISODE.,"So, on the bloody sand, Sohrab lay dead;"
3218,AN EPISODE.,And the great Rustum drew his horseman’s cloak
3219,AN EPISODE.,"Down o’er his face, and sate by his dead son."
3220,AN EPISODE.,"As those black granite pillars, once high-reared"
3221,AN EPISODE.,"By Jemshid in Persepolis, to bear"
3222,AN EPISODE.,"His house, now ’mid their broken flights of steps"
3223,AN EPISODE.,"Lie prone, enormous, down the mountain side,--"
3224,AN EPISODE.,So in the sand lay Rustum by his son.
3225,AN EPISODE.,"And night came down over the solemn waste,"
3226,AN EPISODE.,"And the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair,"
3227,AN EPISODE.,"And darkened all; and a cold fog, with night,"
3228,AN EPISODE.,"Crept from the Oxus. Soon a hum arose,"
3229,AN EPISODE.,"As of a great assembly loosed, and fires"
3230,AN EPISODE.,Began to twinkle through the fog; for now
3231,AN EPISODE.,"Both armies moved to camp, and took their meal;"
3232,AN EPISODE.,The Persians took it on the open sands
3233,AN EPISODE.,"Southward, the Tartars by the river-marge;"
3234,AN EPISODE.,And Rustum and his son were left alone.
3235,AN EPISODE.,
3236,AN EPISODE.,"But the majestic river floated on,"
3237,AN EPISODE.,"Out of the mist and hum of that low land,"
3238,AN EPISODE.,"Into the frosty starlight, and there moved,"
3239,AN EPISODE.,"Rejoicing, through the hushed Chorasmian waste,"
3240,AN EPISODE.,Under the solitary moon; he flowed
3241,AN EPISODE.,"Right for the polar star, past Orgunjè,"
3242,AN EPISODE.,"Brimming, and bright, and large; then sands begin"
3243,AN EPISODE.,"To hem his watery march, and dam his streams,"
3244,AN EPISODE.,And split his currents; that for many a league
3245,AN EPISODE.,The shorn and parcelled Oxus strains along
3246,AN EPISODE.,"Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles,--"
3247,AN EPISODE.,"Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had"
3248,AN EPISODE.,"In his high mountain cradle in Pamere,"
3249,AN EPISODE.,"A foiled circuitous wanderer,--till at last"
3250,AN EPISODE.,"The longed-for dash of waves is heard, and wide"
3251,AN EPISODE.,"His luminous home of waters opens, bright"
3252,AN EPISODE.,"And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars"

3372,HUSSEIN.,"“But in the night, which was with wind"

3380,HUSSEIN.,"As they were thirsty, and the night"
3381,HUSSEIN.,"Most sultry, drained the pitcher there;"
3382,HUSSEIN.,"That they sate with it, in my sight,"
3383,HUSSEIN.,"Their lips still wet, when I came down."
3384,HUSSEIN.,
3385,HUSSEIN.,"“Now mark! I, being fevered, sick,"
3386,HUSSEIN.,"(Most unblest also), at that sight"

3388,HUSSEIN.,One was my mother.---- Now do right!”
3389,HUSSEIN.,
3390,HUSSEIN.,"But my lord mused a space, and said,--"

3392,HUSSEIN.,"It is some madman,” the king said."

3394,HUSSEIN.,
3395,HUSSEIN.,"The morrow, at the self-same hour,"
3396,HUSSEIN.,"In the king’s path, behold, the man,"
3397,HUSSEIN.,"Not kneeling, sternly fixed! He stood"
3398,HUSSEIN.,"Right opposite, and thus began,"
3399,HUSSEIN.,"Frowning grim down: “Thou wicked king,"
3400,HUSSEIN.,Most deaf where thou shouldst most give ear!
3401,HUSSEIN.,"What! must I howl in the next world,"
3402,HUSSEIN.,Because thou wilt not listen here?
3403,HUSSEIN.,
3404,HUSSEIN.,"“What! wilt thou pray, and get thee grace,"
3405,HUSSEIN.,And all grace shall to me be grudged?
3406,HUSSEIN.,"Nay, but I swear, from this thy path"
3407,HUSSEIN.,I will not stir till I be judged!”
3408,HUSSEIN.,
3409,HUSSEIN.,Then they who stood about the king
3410,HUSSEIN.,"Drew close together, and conferred;"
3411,HUSSEIN.,"Till that the king stood forth, and said,"
3412,HUSSEIN.,“Before the priests thou shalt be heard.”
3413,HUSSEIN.,
3414,HUSSEIN.,"But when the Ulemas were met,"
3415,HUSSEIN.,"And the thing heard, they doubted not;"
3416,HUSSEIN.,"But sentenced him, as the law is,"
3417,HUSSEIN.,To die by stoning on the spot.
3418,HUSSEIN.,
3419,HUSSEIN.,Now the king charged us secretly:
3420,HUSSEIN.,"“Stoned must he be, the law stands so."
3421,HUSSEIN.,"Yet, if he seek to fly, give way:"
3422,HUSSEIN.,"Hinder him not, but let him go.”"
3423,HUSSEIN.,
3424,HUSSEIN.,"So saying, the king took a stone,"
3425,HUSSEIN.,"And cast it softly; but the man,"
3426,HUSSEIN.,"With a great joy upon his face,"
3427,HUSSEIN.,"Kneeled down, and cried not, neither ran."
3428,HUSSEIN.,
3429,HUSSEIN.,"So they, whose lot it was, cast stones,"
3430,HUSSEIN.,"That they flew thick, and bruised him sore."
3431,HUSSEIN.,"But he praised Allah with loud voice,"
3432,HUSSEIN.,And remained kneeling as before.
3433,HUSSEIN.,
3434,HUSSEIN.,My lord had covered up his face;
3435,HUSSEIN.,"But when one told him, “He is dead,”"
3436,HUSSEIN.,"Turning him quickly to go in,"
3437,HUSSEIN.,"“Bring thou to me his corpse,” he said."
3438,HUSSEIN.,
3439,HUSSEIN.,"And truly, while I speak, O king,"
3440,HUSSEIN.,I hear the bearers on the stair:
3441,HUSSEIN.,Wilt thou they straightway bring him in?
3442,HUSSEIN.,--Ho! enter ye who tarry there!

3449,THE VIZIER.,"Is he thy friend, or of thy blood,"
3450,THE VIZIER.,To find such favor in thine eyes?
3451,THE VIZIER.,
3452,THE VIZIER.,"Nay, were he thine own mother’s son,"

3457,THE VIZIER.,"But being nothing, as he is,"

3604,I. SENDING.,"I lose to-day, so bright, so loved a god."
3605,I. SENDING.,But he has met that doom which long ago
3606,I. SENDING.,"The Nornies, when his mother bare him, spun,"
3607,I. SENDING.,"And fate set seal, that so his end must be."
3608,I. SENDING.,"Balder has met his death, and ye survive."
3609,I. SENDING.,"Weep him an hour, but what can grief avail?"
3610,I. SENDING.,"For ye yourselves, ye gods, shall meet your doom,--"
3611,I. SENDING.,"All ye who hear me, and inhabit heaven,"
3612,I. SENDING.,"And I too, Odin too, the lord of all."
3613,I. SENDING.,"But ours we shall not meet, when that day comes,"
3614,I. SENDING.,With women’s tears and weak complaining cries:
3615,I. SENDING.,Why should we meet another’s portion so?
3616,I. SENDING.,"Rather it fits you, having wept your hour,"
3617,I. SENDING.,"With cold dry eyes, and hearts composed and stern,"
3618,I. SENDING.,"To live, as erst, your daily life in heaven."
3619,I. SENDING.,"By me shall vengeance on the murderer Lok,"
3620,I. SENDING.,"The foe, the accuser, whom, though gods, we hate,"
3621,I. SENDING.,"Be strictly cared for, in the appointed day."
3622,I. SENDING.,"Meanwhile, to-morrow, when the morning dawns,"
3623,I. SENDING.,"Bring wood to the seashore to Balder’s ship,"
3624,I. SENDING.,"And on the deck build high a funeral pile,"
3625,I. SENDING.,"And on the top lay Balder’s corpse, and put"
3626,I. SENDING.,"Fire to the wood, and send him out to sea"
3627,I. SENDING.,To burn; for that is what the dead desire.”
3628,I. SENDING.,"So spake the king of gods, and straightway rose,"
3629,I. SENDING.,"And mounted his horse Sleipner, whom he rode;"
3630,I. SENDING.,And from the hall of heaven he rode away
3631,I. SENDING.,"To Lidskialf, and sate upon his throne,"
3632,I. SENDING.,"The mount, from whence his eye surveys the world."
3633,I. SENDING.,And far from heaven he turned his shining orbs
3634,I. SENDING.,"To look on Midgard, and the earth, and men."
3635,I. SENDING.,"And on the conjuring Lapps he bent his gaze,"
3636,I. SENDING.,Whom antlered reindeer pull over the snow;
3637,I. SENDING.,"And on the Finns, the gentlest of mankind,"
3638,I. SENDING.,"Fair men, who live in holes under the ground;"
3639,I. SENDING.,"Nor did he look once more to Ida’s plain,"
3640,I. SENDING.,Nor toward Valhalla and the sorrowing gods;
3641,I. SENDING.,"For well he knew the gods would heed his word,"
3642,I. SENDING.,"And cease to mourn, and think of Balder’s pyre."
3643,I. SENDING.,But in Valhalla all the gods went back
3644,I. SENDING.,"From around Balder, all the heroes went;"
3645,I. SENDING.,And left his body stretched upon the floor.
3646,I. SENDING.,"And on their golden chairs they sate again,"
3647,I. SENDING.,"Beside the tables, in the hall of heaven;"
3648,I. SENDING.,And before each the cooks who served them placed
3649,I. SENDING.,"New messes of the boar Serimner’s flesh,"
3650,I. SENDING.,And the Valkyries crowned their horns with mead.
3651,I. SENDING.,"So they, with pent-up hearts and tearless eyes,"
3652,I. SENDING.,"Wailing no more, in silence ate and drank,"
3653,I. SENDING.,"While twilight fell, and sacred night came on."
3654,I. SENDING.,But the blind Hoder left the feasting gods
3655,I. SENDING.,"In Odin’s hall, and went through Asgard streets,"
3656,I. SENDING.,And past the haven where the gods have moored
3657,I. SENDING.,"Their ships, and through the gate, beyond the wall;"
3658,I. SENDING.,"Though sightless, yet his own mind led the god."
3659,I. SENDING.,Down to the margin of the roaring sea
3660,I. SENDING.,"He came, and sadly went along the sand,"
3661,I. SENDING.,Between the waves and black o’erhanging cliffs
3662,I. SENDING.,Where in and out the screaming seafowl fly;
3663,I. SENDING.,Until he came to where a gully breaks
3664,I. SENDING.,"Through the cliff-wall, and a fresh stream runs down"
3665,I. SENDING.,"From the high moors behind, and meets the sea."
3666,I. SENDING.,"There, in the glen, Fensaler stands, the house"
3667,I. SENDING.,"Of Frea, honored mother of the gods,"
3668,I. SENDING.,And shows its lighted windows to the main.
3669,I. SENDING.,"There he went up, and passed the open doors;"
3670,I. SENDING.,"And in the hall he found those women old,"
3671,I. SENDING.,"The prophetesses, who by rite eterne"
3672,I. SENDING.,On Frea’s hearth feed high the sacred fire
3673,I. SENDING.,Both night and day; and by the inner wall
3674,I. SENDING.,"Upon her golden chair the mother sate,"
3675,I. SENDING.,"With folded hands, revolving things to come."
3676,I. SENDING.,"To her drew Hoder near, and spake, and said,--"
3677,I. SENDING.,"“Mother, a child of bale thou bar’st in me!"
3678,I. SENDING.,"For, first, thou barest me with blinded eyes,"
3679,I. SENDING.,"Sightless and helpless, wandering weak in heaven;"
3680,I. SENDING.,"And, after that, of ignorant witless mind"
3681,I. SENDING.,"Thou barest me, and unforeseeing soul;"
3682,I. SENDING.,"That I alone must take the branch from Lok,"
3683,I. SENDING.,"The foe, the accuser, whom, though gods, we hate,"
3684,I. SENDING.,"And cast it at the dear-loved Balder’s breast,"
3685,I. SENDING.,At whom the gods in sport their weapons threw.
3686,I. SENDING.,’Gainst that alone had Balder’s life no charm.
3687,I. SENDING.,"Now therefore what to attempt, or whither fly,"
3688,I. SENDING.,For who will bear my hateful sight in heaven?
3689,I. SENDING.,"Can I, O mother, bring them Balder back?"
3690,I. SENDING.,"Or--for thou know’st the fates, and things allowed--"
3691,I. SENDING.,"Can I with Hela’s power a compact strike,"
3692,I. SENDING.,"And make exchange, and give my life for his?”"
3693,I. SENDING.,"He spoke: the mother of the gods replied,--"
3694,I. SENDING.,"“Hoder, ill-fated, child of bale, my son,"
3695,I. SENDING.,"Sightless in soul and eye, what words are these?"
3696,I. SENDING.,"That one, long portioned with his doom of death,"
3697,I. SENDING.,"Should change his lot, and fill another’s life,"
3698,I. SENDING.,"And Hela yield to this, and let him go!"
3699,I. SENDING.,"On Balder, Death hath laid her hand, not thee;"
3700,I. SENDING.,Nor doth she count this life a price for that.
3701,I. SENDING.,"For many gods in heaven, not thou alone,"
3702,I. SENDING.,"Would freely die to purchase Balder back,"
3703,I. SENDING.,And wend themselves to Hela’s gloomy realm.
3704,I. SENDING.,For not so gladsome is that life in heaven
3705,I. SENDING.,"Which gods and heroes lead, in feast and fray,"
3706,I. SENDING.,"Waiting the darkness of the final times,"
3707,I. SENDING.,"That one should grudge its loss for Balder’s sake,--"
3708,I. SENDING.,"Balder their joy, so bright, so loved a god."
3709,I. SENDING.,"But fate withstands, and laws forbid this way."
3710,I. SENDING.,"Yet in my secret mind one way I know,"
3711,I. SENDING.,Nor do I judge if it shall win or fail;
3712,I. SENDING.,"But much must still be tried, which shall but fail.”"
3713,I. SENDING.,"And the blind Hoder answered her, and said,--"
3714,I. SENDING.,"“What way is this, O mother, that thou show’st?"
3715,I. SENDING.,Is it a matter which a god might try?”
3716,I. SENDING.,"And straight the mother of the gods replied,--"
3717,I. SENDING.,"“There is a way which leads to Hela’s realm,"
3718,I. SENDING.,"Untrodden, lonely, far from light and heaven."
3719,I. SENDING.,Who goes that way must take no other horse
3720,I. SENDING.,"To ride, but Sleipner, Odin’s horse, alone."
3721,I. SENDING.,Nor must he choose that common path of gods
3722,I. SENDING.,"Which every day they come and go in heaven,"
3723,I. SENDING.,"O’er the bridge Bifrost, where is Heimdall’s watch,"
3724,I. SENDING.,"Past Midgard fortress, down to earth and men."
3725,I. SENDING.,But he must tread a dark untravelled road
3726,I. SENDING.,"Which branches from the north of heaven, and ride"
3727,I. SENDING.,"Nine days, nine nights, toward the northern ice,"
3728,I. SENDING.,Through valleys deep-ingulfed with roaring streams.
3729,I. SENDING.,And he will reach on the tenth morn a bridge
3730,I. SENDING.,"Which spans with golden arches Giall’s stream,"
3731,I. SENDING.,"Not Bifrost, but that bridge a damsel keeps,"
3732,I. SENDING.,Who tells the passing troops of dead their way
3733,I. SENDING.,"To the low shore of ghosts, and Hela’s realm."
3734,I. SENDING.,And she will bid him northward steer his course.
3735,I. SENDING.,"Then he will journey through no lighted land,"
3736,I. SENDING.,"Nor see the sun arise, nor see it set;"
3737,I. SENDING.,"But he must ever watch the northern Bear,"
3738,I. SENDING.,Who from her frozen height with jealous eye
3739,I. SENDING.,"Confronts the Dog and Hunter in the south,"
3740,I. SENDING.,And is alone not dipt in ocean’s stream;
3741,I. SENDING.,"And straight he will come down to ocean’s strand,--"
3742,I. SENDING.,"Ocean, whose watery ring infolds the world,"
3743,I. SENDING.,And on whose marge the ancient giants dwell.
3744,I. SENDING.,"But he will reach its unknown northern shore,"
3745,I. SENDING.,"Far, far beyond the outmost giant’s home,"
3746,I. SENDING.,"At the chinked fields of ice, the wastes of snow."
3747,I. SENDING.,And he must fare across the dismal ice
3748,I. SENDING.,"Northward, until he meets a stretching wall"
3749,I. SENDING.,"Barring his way, and in the wall a grate."
3750,I. SENDING.,"But then he must dismount, and on the ice"
3751,I. SENDING.,"Tighten the girths of Sleipner, Odin’s horse,"
3752,I. SENDING.,"And make him leap the grate, and come within."
3753,I. SENDING.,"And he will see stretch round him Hela’s realm,"
3754,I. SENDING.,"The plains of Niflheim, where dwell the dead,"
3755,I. SENDING.,And hear the roaring of the streams of hell.
3756,I. SENDING.,"And he will see the feeble, shadowy tribes,"
3757,I. SENDING.,"And Balder sitting crowned, and Hela’s throne."
3758,I. SENDING.,Then must he not regard the wailful ghosts
3759,I. SENDING.,"Who all will flit, like eddying leaves, around;"
3760,I. SENDING.,"But he must straight accost their solemn queen,"
3761,I. SENDING.,"And pay her homage, and entreat with prayers,"
3762,I. SENDING.,Telling her all that grief they have in heaven
3763,I. SENDING.,"For Balder, whom she holds by right below;"
3764,I. SENDING.,"If haply he may melt her heart with words,"
3765,I. SENDING.,"And make her yield, and give him Balder back.”"
3766,I. SENDING.,"She spoke; but Hoder answered her and said,--"
3767,I. SENDING.,"“Mother, a dreadful way is this thou show’st;"
3768,I. SENDING.,No journey for a sightless god to go!”
3769,I. SENDING.,"And straight the mother of the gods replied,--"
3770,I. SENDING.,"“Therefore thyself thou shalt not go, my son."
3771,I. SENDING.,But he whom first thou meetest when thou com’st
3772,I. SENDING.,"To Asgard, and declar’st this hidden way,"
3773,I. SENDING.,Shall go; and I will be his guide unseen.”
3774,I. SENDING.,"She spoke, and on her face let fall her veil,"
3775,I. SENDING.,"And bowed her head, and sate with folded hands."
3776,I. SENDING.,"But at the central hearth those women old,"
3777,I. SENDING.,"Who while the mother spake had ceased their toil,"
3778,I. SENDING.,Began again to heap the sacred fire.
3779,I. SENDING.,"And Hoder turned, and left his mother’s house,"
3780,I. SENDING.,"Fensaler, whose lit windows look to sea;"
3781,I. SENDING.,"And came again down to the roaring waves,"
3782,I. SENDING.,"And back along the beach to Asgard went,"
3783,I. SENDING.,Pondering on that which Frea said should be.
3784,I. SENDING.,"But night came down, and darkened Asgard streets."
3785,I. SENDING.,"Then from their loathèd feast the gods arose,"
3786,I. SENDING.,"And lighted torches, and took up the corpse"
3787,I. SENDING.,"Of Balder from the floor of Odin’s hall,"
3788,I. SENDING.,"And laid it on a bier, and bare him home"
3789,I. SENDING.,Through the fast-darkening streets to his own house
3790,I. SENDING.,"Breidablik, on whose columns Balder graved"
3791,I. SENDING.,The enchantments that recall the dead to life.
3792,I. SENDING.,"For wise he was, and many curious arts,"
3793,I. SENDING.,"Postures of runes, and healing herbs he knew;"
3794,I. SENDING.,"Unhappy! but that art he did not know,"
3795,I. SENDING.,"To keep his own life safe, and see the sun."
3796,I. SENDING.,"There to his hall the gods brought Balder home,"
3797,I. SENDING.,"And each bespake him as he laid him down,--"
3798,I. SENDING.,"“Would that ourselves, O Balder, we were borne"
3799,I. SENDING.,"Home to our halls, with torchlight, by our kin,"
3800,I. SENDING.,"So thou might’st live, and still delight the gods!”"
3801,I. SENDING.,"They spake, and each went home to his own house."
3802,I. SENDING.,"But there was one, the first of all the gods"
3803,I. SENDING.,"For speed, and Hermod was his name in heaven;"
3804,I. SENDING.,"Most fleet he was, but now he went the last,"
3805,I. SENDING.,"Heavy in heart for Balder, to his house"
3806,I. SENDING.,"Which he in Asgard built him, there to dwell,"
3807,I. SENDING.,"Against the harbor, by the city-wall."
3808,I. SENDING.,"Him the blind Hoder met, as he came up"
3809,I. SENDING.,"From the sea cityward, and knew his step;"
3810,I. SENDING.,"Nor yet could Hermod see his brother’s face,"
3811,I. SENDING.,For it grew dark; but Hoder touched his arm.
3812,I. SENDING.,And as a spray of honeysuckle-flowers
3813,I. SENDING.,Brushes across a tired traveller’s face
3814,I. SENDING.,"Who shuffles through the deep dew-moistened dust,"
3815,I. SENDING.,"On a May evening, in the darkened lanes,"
3816,I. SENDING.,"And starts him, that he thinks a ghost went by,--"
3817,I. SENDING.,"So Hoder brushed by Hermod’s side, and said,--"
3818,I. SENDING.,"“Take Sleipner, Hermod, and set forth with dawn"
3819,I. SENDING.,"To Hela’s kingdom, to ask Balder back;"
3820,I. SENDING.,"And they shall be thy guides, who have the power.”"
3821,I. SENDING.,"He spake, and brushed soft by, and disappeared."
3822,I. SENDING.,"And Hermod gazed into the night, and said,--"
3823,I. SENDING.,“Who is it utters through the dark his best
3824,I. SENDING.,"So quickly, and will wait for no reply?"
3825,I. SENDING.,The voice was like the unhappy Hoder’s voice.
3826,I. SENDING.,"Howbeit I will see, and do his hest;"
3827,I. SENDING.,For there rang note divine in that command.”
3828,I. SENDING.,"So speaking, the fleet-footed Hermod came"
3829,I. SENDING.,"Home, and lay down to sleep in his own house;"
3830,I. SENDING.,And all the gods lay down in their own homes.
3831,I. SENDING.,"And Hoder too came home, distraught with grief,"
3832,I. SENDING.,"Loathing to meet, at dawn, the other gods;"
3833,I. SENDING.,"And he went in, and shut the door, and fixed"
3834,I. SENDING.,"His sword upright, and fell on it, and died."
3835,I. SENDING.,"But from the hill of Lidskialf Odin rose,--"
3836,I. SENDING.,"The throne from which his eye surveys the world,--"
3837,I. SENDING.,"And mounted Sleipner, and in darkness rode"
3838,I. SENDING.,"To Asgard. And the stars came out in heaven,"
3839,I. SENDING.,"High over Asgard, to light home the king."
3840,I. SENDING.,"But fiercely Odin galloped, moved in heart;"
3841,I. SENDING.,"And swift to Asgard, to the gate, he came;"
3842,I. SENDING.,And terribly the hoofs of Sleipner rang
3843,I. SENDING.,Along the flinty floor of Asgard streets;
3844,I. SENDING.,And the gods trembled on their golden beds
3845,I. SENDING.,"Hearing the wrathful Father coming home,--"
3846,I. SENDING.,"For dread, for like a whirlwind, Odin came."
3847,I. SENDING.,"And to Valhalla’s gate he rode, and left"
3848,I. SENDING.,Sleipner; and Sleipner went to his own stall;
3849,I. SENDING.,And in Valhalla Odin laid him down.
3850,I. SENDING.,"But in Breidablik Nanna, Balder’s wife,"
3851,I. SENDING.,"Came with the goddesses who wrought her will,"
3852,I. SENDING.,And stood by Balder lying on his bier.
3853,I. SENDING.,And at his head and feet she stationed scalds
3854,I. SENDING.,Who in their lives were famous for their song;
3855,I. SENDING.,"These o’er the corpse intoned a plaintive strain,"
3856,I. SENDING.,"A dirge,--and Nanna and her train replied."
3857,I. SENDING.,And far into the night they wailed their dirge;
3858,I. SENDING.,"But when their souls were satisfied with wail,"
3859,I. SENDING.,"They went, and laid them down, and Nanna went"
3860,I. SENDING.,"Into an upper chamber, and lay down;"
3861,I. SENDING.,And Frea sealed her tired lids with sleep.
3862,I. SENDING.,"And ’twas when night is bordering hard on dawn,"
3863,I. SENDING.,"When air is chilliest, and the stars sunk low;"
3864,I. SENDING.,"Then Balder’s spirit through the gloom drew near,"
3865,I. SENDING.,"In garb, in form, in feature, as he was,"
3866,I. SENDING.,Alive; and still the rays were round his head
3867,I. SENDING.,Which were his glorious mark in heaven; he stood
3868,I. SENDING.,"Over against the curtain of the bed,"
3869,I. SENDING.,"And gazed on Nanna as she slept, and spake,--"
3870,I. SENDING.,"“Poor lamb, thou sleepest, and forgett’st thy woe!"
3871,I. SENDING.,"Tears stand upon the lashes of thine eyes,"
3872,I. SENDING.,"Tears wet the pillow by thy cheek; but thou,"
3873,I. SENDING.,"Like a young child, hast cried thyself to sleep."
3874,I. SENDING.,"Sleep on; I watch thee, and am here to aid."
3875,I. SENDING.,"Alive I kept not far from thee, dear soul!"
3876,I. SENDING.,"Neither do I neglect thee now, though dead."
3877,I. SENDING.,For with to-morrow’s dawn the gods prepare
3878,I. SENDING.,"To gather wood, and build a funeral-pile"
3879,I. SENDING.,"Upon my ship, and burn my corpse with fire,"
3880,I. SENDING.,"That sad, sole honor of the dead; and thee"
3881,I. SENDING.,"They think to burn, and all my choicest wealth,"
3882,I. SENDING.,"With me, for thus ordains the common rite."
3883,I. SENDING.,"But it shall not be so; but mild, but swift,"
3884,I. SENDING.,"But painless, shall a stroke from Frea come,"
3885,I. SENDING.,"To cut thy thread of life, and free thy soul,"
3886,I. SENDING.,"And they shall burn thy corpse with mine, not thee."
3887,I. SENDING.,"And well I know that by no stroke of death,"
3888,I. SENDING.,"Tardy or swift, wouldst thou be loath to die,"
3889,I. SENDING.,"So it restored thee, Nanna, to my side,"
3890,I. SENDING.,Whom thou so well hast loved; but I can smooth
3891,I. SENDING.,"Thy way, and this, at least, my prayers avail."
3892,I. SENDING.,"Yes, and I fain would altogether ward"
3893,I. SENDING.,"Death from thy head, and with the gods in heaven"
3894,I. SENDING.,"Prolong thy life, though not by thee desired;"
3895,I. SENDING.,"But right bars this, not only thy desire."
3896,I. SENDING.,"Yet dreary, Nanna, is the life they lead"
3897,I. SENDING.,"In that dim world, in Hela’s mouldering realm;"
3898,I. SENDING.,"And doleful are the ghosts, the troops of dead,"
3899,I. SENDING.,Whom Hela with austere control presides.
3900,I. SENDING.,"For of the race of gods is no one there,"
3901,I. SENDING.,"Save me alone, and Hela, solemn queen."
3902,I. SENDING.,For all the nobler souls of mortal men
3903,I. SENDING.,"On battle-field have met their death, and now"
3904,I. SENDING.,"Feast in Valhalla, in my father’s hall:"
3905,I. SENDING.,Only the inglorious sort are there below;
3906,I. SENDING.,"The old, the cowards, and the weak are there,--"
3907,I. SENDING.,"Men spent by sickness, or obscure decay."
3908,I. SENDING.,"But even there, O Nanna, we might find"
3909,I. SENDING.,"Some solace in each other’s look and speech,"
3910,I. SENDING.,"Wandering together through that gloomy world,"
3911,I. SENDING.,"And talking of the life we led in heaven,"
3912,I. SENDING.,"While we yet lived, among the other gods.”"
3913,I. SENDING.,"He spake, and straight his lineaments began"
3914,I. SENDING.,To fade; and Nanna in her sleep stretched out
3915,I. SENDING.,Her arms towards him with a cry; but he
3916,I. SENDING.,"Mournfully shook his head, and disappeared."
3917,I. SENDING.,And as the woodman sees a little smoke
3918,I. SENDING.,"Hang in the air afield, and disappear,"
3919,I. SENDING.,So Balder faded in the night away.
3920,I. SENDING.,And Nanna on her bed sank back; but then
3921,I. SENDING.,"Frea, the mother of the gods, with stroke"
3922,I. SENDING.,"Painless and swift, set free her airy soul,"
3923,I. SENDING.,"Which took, on Balder’s track, the way below;"
3924,I. SENDING.,And instantly the sacred morn appeared.
3925,I. SENDING.,
3926,I. SENDING.,
3927,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.
3928,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,
3929,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Forth from the east, up the ascent of heaven,"
3930,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Day drove his courser with the shining mane;
3931,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And in Valhalla, from his gable-perch,"
3932,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,The golden-crested cock began to crow.
3933,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Hereafter, in the blackest dead of night,"
3934,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"With shrill and dismal cries that bird shall crow,"
3935,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Warning the gods that foes draw nigh to heaven;
3936,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"But now he crew at dawn, a cheerful note,"
3937,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,To wake the gods and heroes to their tasks.
3938,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And all the gods and all the heroes woke.
3939,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And from their beds the heroes rose, and donned"
3940,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Their arms, and led their horses from the stall,"
3941,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And mounted them, and in Valhalla’s court"
3942,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Were ranged; and then the daily fray began.
3943,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And all day long they there are hacked and hewn
3944,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"’Mid dust, and groans, and limbs lopped off, and blood;"
3945,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,But all at night return to Odin’s hall
3946,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Woundless and fresh: such lot is theirs in heaven.
3947,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And the Valkyries on their steeds went forth
3948,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Toward earth and fights of men; and at their side
3949,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Skulda, the youngest of the Nornies, rode;"
3950,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And over Bifrost, where is Heimdall’s watch,"
3951,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Past Midgard fortress, down to earth they came;"
3952,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"There through some battle-field, where men fall fast,"
3953,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Their horses fetlock-deep in blood, they ride,"
3954,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And pick the bravest warriors out for death,"
3955,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Whom they bring back with them at night to heaven,"
3956,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"To glad the gods, and feast in Odin’s hall."
3957,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"But the gods went not now, as otherwhile,"
3958,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Into the tilt-yard, where the heroes fought,"
3959,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,To feast their eyes with looking on the fray;
3960,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Nor did they to their judgment-place repair
3961,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"By the ash Igdrasil, in Ida’s plain,"
3962,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Where they hold council, and give laws for men."
3963,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"But they went, Odin first, the rest behind,"
3964,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"To the hall Gladheim, which is built of gold;"
3965,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Where are in circle ranged twelve golden chairs,"
3966,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And in the midst one higher, Odin’s throne."
3967,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,There all the gods in silence sate them down;
3968,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And thus the Father of the ages spake:--
3969,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"“Go quickly, gods, bring wood to the seashore,"
3970,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"With all which it beseems the dead to have,"
3971,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And make a funeral-pile on Balder’s ship;
3972,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,On the twelfth day the gods shall burn his corpse.
3973,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"But, Hermod, thou take Sleipner, and ride down"
3974,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"To Hela’s kingdom, to ask Balder back.”"
3975,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"So said he; and the gods arose, and took"
3976,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Axes and ropes, and at their head came Thor,"
3977,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Shouldering his hammer, which the giants know."
3978,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Forth wended they, and drave their steeds before."
3979,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And up the dewy mountain tracks they fared
3980,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"To the dark forests, in the early dawn;"
3981,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And up and down, and side and slant they roamed."
3982,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And from the glens all day an echo came
3983,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Of crashing falls; for with his hammer Thor
3984,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Smote ’mid the rocks the lichen-bearded pines,"
3985,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And burst their roots, while to their tops the gods"
3986,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Made fast the woven ropes, and haled them down,"
3987,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And lopped their boughs, and clove them on the sward,"
3988,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And bound the logs behind their steeds to draw,"
3989,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And drave them homeward; and the snorting steeds
3990,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Went straining through the crackling brushwood down,"
3991,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And by the darkling forest-paths the gods
3992,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Followed, and on their shoulders carried boughs."
3993,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And they came out upon the plain, and passed"
3994,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Asgard, and led their horses to the beach,"
3995,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And loosed them of their loads on the seashore,"
3996,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And ranged the wood in stacks by Balder’s ship;
3997,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And every god went home to his own house.
3998,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,
3999,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"But when the gods were to the forest gone,"
4000,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Hermod led Sleipner from Valhalla forth,"
4001,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And saddled him: before that, Sleipner brooked"
4002,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"No meaner hand than Odin’s on his mane,"
4003,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,On his broad back no lesser rider bore;
4004,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Yet docile now he stood at Hermod’s side,"
4005,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Arching his neck, and glad to be bestrode,"
4006,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Knowing the god they went to seek, how dear."
4007,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"But Hermod mounted him, and sadly fared"
4008,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,In silence up the dark untravelled road
4009,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Which branches from the north of heaven, and went"
4010,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"All day; and daylight waned, and night came on."
4011,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And all that night he rode, and journeyed so,"
4012,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Nine days, nine nights, toward the northern ice,"
4013,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Through valleys deep-ingulfed, by roaring streams."
4014,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And on the tenth morn he beheld the bridge
4015,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Which spans with golden arches Giall’s stream,"
4016,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And on the bridge a damsel watching armed,"
4017,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"In the strait passage, at the farther end,"
4018,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Where the road issues between walling rocks.
4019,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Scant space that warder left for passers-by;
4020,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,But as when cowherds in October drive
4021,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Their kine across a snowy mountain pass
4022,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"To winter pasture on the southern side,"
4023,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And on the ridge a wagon chokes the way,"
4024,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Wedged in the snow; then painfully the hinds
4025,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"With goad and shouting urge their cattle past,"
4026,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Plunging through deep untrodden banks of snow
4027,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"To right and left, and warm steam fills the air,--"
4028,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"So on the bridge that damsel blocked the way,"
4029,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And questioned Hermod as he came, and said,--"
4030,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"“Who art thou on thy black and fiery horse,"
4031,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Under whose hoofs the bridge o’er Giall’s stream
4032,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Rumbles and shakes? Tell me thy race and home.
4033,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"But yester-morn, five troops of dead passed by,"
4034,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Bound on their way below to Hela’s realm,"
4035,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Nor shook the bridge so much as thou alone.
4036,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And thou hast flesh and color on thy cheeks,"
4037,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Like men who live, and draw the vital air;"
4038,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Nor look’st thou pale and wan, like men deceased,"
4039,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Souls bound below, my daily passers here.”"
4040,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And the fleet-footed Hermod answered her,--"
4041,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"“O damsel, Hermod am I called, the son"
4042,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Of Odin; and my high-roofed house is built
4043,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Far hence, in Asgard, in the city of gods;"
4044,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And Sleipner, Odin’s horse, is this I ride."
4045,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And I come, sent this road on Balder’s track:"
4046,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Say, then, if he hath crossed thy bridge or no?”"
4047,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"He spake; the warder of the bridge replied,--"
4048,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"“O Hermod, rarely do the feet of gods"
4049,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Or of the horses of the gods resound
4050,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Upon my bridge; and, when they cross, I know."
4051,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Balder hath gone this way, and ta’en the road"
4052,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Below there, to the north, toward Hela’s realm."
4053,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"From here the cold white mist can be discerned,"
4054,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Not lit with sun, but through the darksome air"
4055,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"By the dim vapor-blotted light of stars,"
4056,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Which hangs over the ice where lies the road.
4057,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"For in that ice are lost those northern streams,"
4058,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Freezing and ridging in their onward flow,"
4059,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Which from the fountain of Vergelmer run,"
4060,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,The spring that bubbles up by Hela’s throne.
4061,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"There are the joyless seats, the haunt of ghosts,"
4062,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Hela’s pale swarms; and there was Balder bound.
4063,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Ride on! pass free! but he by this is there.”
4064,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"She spake, and stepped aside, and left him room."
4065,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And Hermod greeted her, and galloped by"
4066,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Across the bridge; then she took post again.
4067,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"But northward Hermod rode, the way below;"
4068,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And o’er a darksome tract, which knows no sun,"
4069,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"But by the blotted light of stars, he fared."
4070,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And he came down to ocean’s northern strand,"
4071,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"At the drear ice, beyond the giants’ home."
4072,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Thence on he journeyed o’er the fields of ice
4073,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Still north, until he met a stretching wall"
4074,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Barring his way, and in the wall a grate."
4075,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Then he dismounted, and drew tight the girths,"
4076,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"On the smooth ice, of Sleipner, Odin’s horse,"
4077,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And made him leap the grate, and came within."
4078,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And he beheld spread round him Hela’s realm,"
4079,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"The plains of Niflheim, where dwell the dead,"
4080,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And heard the thunder of the streams of hell.
4081,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"For near the wall the river of Roaring flows,"
4082,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Outmost; the others near the centre run,--"
4083,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"The Storm, the Abyss, the Howling, and the Pain;"
4084,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"These flow by Hela’s throne, and near their spring."
4085,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And from the dark flocked up the shadowy tribes;
4086,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And as the swallows crowd the bulrush-beds
4087,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Of some clear river, issuing from a lake,"
4088,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"On autumn-days, before they cross the sea;"
4089,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And to each bulrush-crest a swallow hangs
4090,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Swinging, and others skim the river-streams,"
4091,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And their quick twittering fills the banks and shores,--"
4092,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,So around Hermod swarmed the twittering ghosts.
4093,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Women, and infants, and young men who died"
4094,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Too soon for fame, with white ungraven shields;"
4095,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And old men, known to glory, but their star"
4096,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Betrayed them, and of wasting age they died,"
4097,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Not wounds; yet, dying, they their armor wore,"
4098,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And now have chief regard in Hela’s realm.
4099,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Behind flocked wrangling up a piteous crew,"
4100,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Greeted of none, disfeatured and forlorn,--"
4101,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Cowards, who were in sloughs interred alive;"
4102,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And round them still the wattled hurdles hung
4103,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Wherewith they stamped them down, and trod them deep,"
4104,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,To hide their shameful memory from men.
4105,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"But all he passed unhailed, and reached the throne"
4106,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Of Hela, and saw, near it, Balder crowned,"
4107,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And Hela set thereon, with countenance stern;"
4108,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And thus bespake him first the solemn queen:--
4109,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"“Unhappy, how hast thou endured to leave"
4110,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"The light, and journey to the cheerless land"
4111,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Where idly flit about the feeble shades?
4112,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"How didst thou cross the bridge o’er Giall’s stream,"
4113,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Being alive, and come to ocean’s shore?"
4114,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Or how o’erleap the grate that bars the wall?”
4115,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"She spake; but down off Sleipner Hermod sprang,"
4116,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And fell before her feet, and clasped her knees;"
4117,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And spake, and mild entreated her, and said,--"
4118,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"“O Hela, wherefore should the gods declare"
4119,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Their errands to each other, or the ways"
4120,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,They go? the errand and the way is known.
4121,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Thou know’st, thou know’st, what grief we have in heaven"
4122,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"For Balder, whom thou hold’st by right below."
4123,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Restore him! for what part fulfils he here?
4124,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Shall he shed cheer over the cheerless seats,"
4125,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And touch the apathetic ghosts with joy?
4126,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Not for such end, O queen, thou hold’st thy realm."
4127,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"For heaven was Balder born, the city of gods"
4128,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And heroes, where they live in light and joy."
4129,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Thither restore him, for his place is there!”"
4130,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"He spoke; and grave replied the solemn queen,--"
4131,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"“Hermod, for he thou art, thou son of heaven!"
4132,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"A strange unlikely errand, sure, is thine."
4133,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Do the gods send to me to make them blest?
4134,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Small bliss my race hath of the gods obtained.
4135,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Three mighty children to my father Lok
4136,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Did Angerbode, the giantess, bring forth,--"
4137,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Fenris the wolf, the serpent huge, and me."
4138,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Of these the serpent in the sea ye cast,"
4139,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Who since in your despite hath waxed amain,"
4140,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And now with gleaming ring infolds the world;
4141,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Me on this cheerless nether world ye threw,"
4142,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And gave me nine unlighted realms to rule;
4143,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"While on his island in the lake afar,"
4144,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Made fast to the bored crag, by wile not strength"
4145,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Subdued, with limber chains lives Fenris bound."
4146,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Lok still subsists in heaven, our father wise,"
4147,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Your mate, though loathed, and feasts in Odin’s hall;"
4148,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"But him too foes await, and netted snares,"
4149,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And in a cave a bed of needle-rocks,"
4150,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And o’er his visage serpents dropping gall.
4151,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Yet he shall one day rise, and burst his bonds,"
4152,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And with himself set us his offspring free,"
4153,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,When he guides Muspel’s children to their bourne.
4154,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Till then in peril or in pain we live,"
4155,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Wrought by the gods--and ask the gods our aid?
4156,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Howbeit, we abide our day: till then,"
4157,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"We do not as some feebler haters do,--"
4158,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Seek to afflict our foes with petty pangs,"
4159,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Helpless to better us, or ruin them."
4160,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Come, then! if Balder was so dear beloved,"
4161,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And this is true, and such a loss is heaven’s,--"
4162,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Hear how to heaven may Balder be restored.
4163,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Show me through all the world the signs of grief!
4164,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Fails but one thing to grieve, here Balder stops!"
4165,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Let all that lives and moves upon the earth
4166,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Weep him, and all that is without life weep;"
4167,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Let gods, men, brutes, beweep him; plants and stones."
4168,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"So shall I know the lost was dear indeed,"
4169,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And bend my heart, and give him back to heaven.”"
4170,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"She spake; and Hermod answered her, and said,--"
4171,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"“Hela, such as thou say’st, the terms shall be."
4172,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"But come, declare me this, and truly tell:"
4173,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"May I, ere I depart, bid Balder hail,"
4174,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Or is it here withheld to greet the dead?”
4175,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"He spake; and straightway Hela answered him,--"
4176,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"“Hermod, greet Balder if thou wilt, and hold"
4177,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Converse; his speech remains, though he be dead.”"
4178,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And straight to Balder Hermod turned, and spake:"
4179,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"“Even in the abode of death, O Balder, hail!"
4180,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Thou hear’st, if hearing, like as speech, is thine,"
4181,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,The terms of thy releasement hence to heaven;
4182,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Fear nothing but that all shall be fulfilled.
4183,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"For not unmindful of thee are the gods,"
4184,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Who see the light, and blest in Asgard dwell;"
4185,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Even here they seek thee out, in Hela’s realm."
4186,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And, sure, of all the happiest far art thou"
4187,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Who ever have been known in earth or heaven:
4188,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Alive, thou wast of gods the most beloved;"
4189,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And now thou sittest crowned by Hela’s side,"
4190,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Here, and hast honor among all the dead.”"
4191,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"He spake; and Balder uttered him reply,"
4192,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"But feebly, as a voice far off; he said,--"
4193,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"“Hermod the nimble, gild me not my death!"
4194,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Better to live a serf, a captured man,"
4195,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Who scatters rushes in a master’s hall,"
4196,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Than be a crowned king here, and rule the dead."
4197,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And now I count not of these terms as safe
4198,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"To be fulfilled, nor my return as sure,"
4199,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Though I be loved, and many mourn my death;"
4200,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,For double-minded ever was the seed
4201,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Of Lok, and double are the gifts they give."
4202,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Howbeit, report thy message; and therewith,"
4203,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"To Odin, to my father, take this ring,"
4204,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Memorial of me, whether saved or no;"
4205,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And tell the heaven-born gods how thou hast seen
4206,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Me sitting here below by Hela’s side,"
4207,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Crowned, having honor among all the dead.”"
4208,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"He spake, and raised his hand, and gave the ring."
4209,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And with inscrutable regard the queen
4210,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Of hell beheld them, and the ghosts stood dumb."
4211,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"But Hermod took the ring, and yet once more"
4212,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Kneeled and did homage to the solemn queen;
4213,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Then mounted Sleipner, and set forth to ride"
4214,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Back, through the astonished tribes of dead, to heaven."
4215,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And to the wall he came, and found the grate"
4216,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Lifted, and issued on the fields of ice."
4217,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And o’er the ice he fared to ocean’s strand,"
4218,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And up from thence, a wet and misty road,"
4219,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"To the armed damsel’s bridge, and Giall’s stream."
4220,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Worse was that way to go than to return,"
4221,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"For him: for others, all return is barred."
4222,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Nine days he took to go, two to return,"
4223,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And on the twelfth morn saw the light of heaven.
4224,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And as a traveller in the early dawn
4225,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"To the steep edge of some great valley comes,"
4226,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Through which a river flows, and sees, beneath,"
4227,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Clouds of white rolling vapors fill the vale,"
4228,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"But o’er them, on the farther slope, descries"
4229,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Vineyards, and crofts, and pastures, bright with sun,--"
4230,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"So Hermod, o’er the fog between, saw heaven."
4231,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And Sleipner snorted, for he smelt the air"
4232,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Of heaven; and mightily, as winged, he flew."
4233,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,And Hermod saw the towers of Asgard rise;
4234,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And he drew near, and heard no living voice"
4235,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,In Asgard; and the golden halls were dumb.
4236,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,Then Hermod knew what labor held the gods;
4237,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"And through the empty streets he rode, and passed"
4238,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,"Under the gate-house to the sands, and found"
4239,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,The gods on the seashore by Balder’s ship.
4240,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,
4241,II. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD.,
4242,III. FUNERAL.,III. FUNERAL.
4243,III. FUNERAL.,
4244,III. FUNERAL.,"The gods held talk together, grouped in knots,"
4245,III. FUNERAL.,"Round Balder’s corpse, which they had thither borne;"
4246,III. FUNERAL.,And Hermod came down towards them from the gate.
4247,III. FUNERAL.,"And Lok, the father of the serpent, first"
4248,III. FUNERAL.,"Beheld him come, and to his neighbor spake,--"
4249,III. FUNERAL.,"“See, here is Hermod, who comes single back"
4250,III. FUNERAL.,From hell; and shall I tell thee how he seems?
4251,III. FUNERAL.,"Like as a farmer, who hath lost his dog,"
4252,III. FUNERAL.,"Some morn, at market, in a crowded town,--"
4253,III. FUNERAL.,"Through many streets the poor beast runs in vain,"
4254,III. FUNERAL.,"And follows this man after that, for hours;"
4255,III. FUNERAL.,"And late at evening, spent and panting, falls"
4256,III. FUNERAL.,"Before a stranger’s threshold, not his home,"
4257,III. FUNERAL.,"With flanks a-tremble, and his slender tongue"
4258,III. FUNERAL.,"Hangs quivering out between his dust-smeared jaws,"
4259,III. FUNERAL.,And piteously he eyes the passers-by;
4260,III. FUNERAL.,"But home his master comes to his own farm,"
4261,III. FUNERAL.,"Far in the country, wondering where he is,--"
4262,III. FUNERAL.,So Hermod comes to-day unfollowed home.”
4263,III. FUNERAL.,"And straight his neighbor, moved with wrath, replied,--"
4264,III. FUNERAL.,"“Deceiver! fair in form, but false in heart!"
4265,III. FUNERAL.,"Enemy, mocker, whom, though gods, we hate,--"
4266,III. FUNERAL.,"Peace, lest our father Odin hear thee gibe!"
4267,III. FUNERAL.,"Would I might see him snatch thee in his hand,"
4268,III. FUNERAL.,"And bind thy carcass, like a bale, with cords,"
4269,III. FUNERAL.,"And hurl thee in a lake, to sink or swim!"
4270,III. FUNERAL.,"If clear from plotting Balder’s death, to swim;"
4271,III. FUNERAL.,"But deep, if thou devisedst it, to drown,"
4272,III. FUNERAL.,"And perish, against fate, before thy day.”"
4273,III. FUNERAL.,So they two soft to one another spake.
4274,III. FUNERAL.,"But Odin looked toward the land, and saw"
4275,III. FUNERAL.,"His messenger; and he stood forth, and cried."
4276,III. FUNERAL.,"And Hermod came, and leapt from Sleipner down,"
4277,III. FUNERAL.,"And in his father’s hand put Sleipner’s rein,"
4278,III. FUNERAL.,"And greeted Odin and the gods, and said,--"
4279,III. FUNERAL.,"“Odin, my father, and ye, gods of heaven!"
4280,III. FUNERAL.,"Lo, home, having performed your will, I come."
4281,III. FUNERAL.,"Into the joyless kingdom have I been,"
4282,III. FUNERAL.,"Below, and looked upon the shadowy tribes"
4283,III. FUNERAL.,"Of ghosts, and communed with their solemn queen;"
4284,III. FUNERAL.,And to your prayer she sends you this reply:--
4285,III. FUNERAL.,_Show her through all the world the signs of grief!_
4286,III. FUNERAL.,"_Fails but one thing to grieve, there Balder stops!_"
4287,III. FUNERAL.,"_Let gods, men, brutes, beweep him; plants and stones._"
4288,III. FUNERAL.,"_So shall she know your loss was dear indeed,_"
4289,III. FUNERAL.,"_And bend her heart, and give you Balder back._”"
4290,III. FUNERAL.,"He spoke, and all the gods to Odin looked;"
4291,III. FUNERAL.,"And straight the Father of the ages said,--"
4292,III. FUNERAL.,"“Ye gods, these terms may keep another day."
4293,III. FUNERAL.,"But now put on your arms, and mount your steeds,"
4294,III. FUNERAL.,"And in procession all come near, and weep"
4295,III. FUNERAL.,Balder; for that is what the dead desire.
4296,III. FUNERAL.,"When ye enough have wept, then build a pile"
4297,III. FUNERAL.,"Of the heaped wood, and burn his corpse with fire"
4298,III. FUNERAL.,"Out of our sight; that we may turn from grief,"
4299,III. FUNERAL.,"And lead, as erst, our daily life in heaven.”"
4300,III. FUNERAL.,"He spoke, and the gods armed; and Odin donned"
4301,III. FUNERAL.,"His dazzling corslet and his helm of gold,"
4302,III. FUNERAL.,And led the way on Sleipner; and the rest
4303,III. FUNERAL.,"Followed, in tears, their father and their king."
4304,III. FUNERAL.,"And thrice in arms around the dead they rode,"
4305,III. FUNERAL.,"Weeping; the sands were wetted, and their arms,"
4306,III. FUNERAL.,"With their thick-falling tears,--so good a friend"
4307,III. FUNERAL.,"They mourned that day, so bright, so loved a god."
4308,III. FUNERAL.,"And Odin came, and laid his kingly hands"
4309,III. FUNERAL.,"On Balder’s breast, and thus began the wail:--"
4310,III. FUNERAL.,"“Farewell, O Balder, bright and loved, my son!"
4311,III. FUNERAL.,"In that great day, the twilight of the gods,"
4312,III. FUNERAL.,"When Muspel’s children shall beleaguer heaven,"
4313,III. FUNERAL.,Then we shall miss thy counsel and thy arm.”
4314,III. FUNERAL.,"Thou camest near the next, O warrior Thor!"
4315,III. FUNERAL.,"Shouldering thy hammer, in thy chariot drawn,"
4316,III. FUNERAL.,Swaying the long-haired goats with silvered rein;
4317,III. FUNERAL.,And over Balder’s corpse these words didst say:--
4318,III. FUNERAL.,"“Brother, thou dwellest in the darksome land,"
4319,III. FUNERAL.,"And talkest with the feeble tribes of ghosts,"
4320,III. FUNERAL.,"Now, and I know not how they prize thee there--"
4321,III. FUNERAL.,"But here, I know, thou wilt be missed and mourned."
4322,III. FUNERAL.,For haughty spirits and high wraths are rife
4323,III. FUNERAL.,"Among the gods and heroes here in heaven,"
4324,III. FUNERAL.,As among those whose joy and work is war;
4325,III. FUNERAL.,"And daily strifes arise, and angry words."
4326,III. FUNERAL.,"But from thy lips, O Balder, night or day,"
4327,III. FUNERAL.,Heard no one ever an injurious word
4328,III. FUNERAL.,"To god or hero, but thou keptest back"
4329,III. FUNERAL.,"The others, laboring to compose their brawls."
4330,III. FUNERAL.,"Be ye then kind, as Balder too was kind!"
4331,III. FUNERAL.,"For we lose him, who smoothed all strife in heaven.”"
4332,III. FUNERAL.,"He spake, and all the gods assenting wailed."
4333,III. FUNERAL.,"And Freya next came nigh, with golden tears;"
4334,III. FUNERAL.,"The loveliest goddess she in heaven, by all"
4335,III. FUNERAL.,"Most honored after Frea, Odin’s wife."
4336,III. FUNERAL.,Her long ago the wandering Oder took
4337,III. FUNERAL.,"To mate, but left her to roam distant lands;"
4338,III. FUNERAL.,"Since then she seeks him, and weeps tears of gold."
4339,III. FUNERAL.,Names hath she many; Vanadis on earth
4340,III. FUNERAL.,"They call her, Freya is her name in heaven;"
4341,III. FUNERAL.,"She in her hands took Balder’s head, and spake,--"
4342,III. FUNERAL.,"“Balder, my brother, thou art gone a road"
4343,III. FUNERAL.,"Unknown and long, and haply on that way"
4344,III. FUNERAL.,"My long-lost wandering Oder thou hast met,"
4345,III. FUNERAL.,For in the paths of heaven he is not found.
4346,III. FUNERAL.,"Oh! if it be so, tell him what thou wast"
4347,III. FUNERAL.,"To his neglected wife, and what he is,"
4348,III. FUNERAL.,"And wring his heart with shame, to hear thy word!"
4349,III. FUNERAL.,"For he, my husband, left me here to pine,"
4350,III. FUNERAL.,"Not long a wife, when his unquiet heart"
4351,III. FUNERAL.,First drove him from me into distant lands;
4352,III. FUNERAL.,"Since then I vainly seek him through the world,"
4353,III. FUNERAL.,"And weep from shore to shore my golden tears,"
4354,III. FUNERAL.,But neither god nor mortal heeds my pain.
4355,III. FUNERAL.,"Thou only, Balder, wast forever kind,"
4356,III. FUNERAL.,"To take my hand, and wipe my tears, and say,--"
4357,III. FUNERAL.,"_Weep not, O Freya, weep no golden tears!_"
4358,III. FUNERAL.,"_One day the wandering Oder will return,_"
4359,III. FUNERAL.,"_Or thou wilt find him in thy faithful search,_"
4360,III. FUNERAL.,"_On some great road, or resting in an inn,_"
4361,III. FUNERAL.,"_Or at a ford, or sleeping by a tree_."
4362,III. FUNERAL.,"So Balder said; but Oder, well I know,"
4363,III. FUNERAL.,My truant Oder I shall see no more
4364,III. FUNERAL.,"To the world’s end; and Balder now is gone,"
4365,III. FUNERAL.,And I am left uncomforted in heaven.”
4366,III. FUNERAL.,"She spake, and all the goddesses bewailed."
4367,III. FUNERAL.,"Last from among the heroes one came near,"
4368,III. FUNERAL.,"No god, but of the hero-troop the chief,--"
4369,III. FUNERAL.,"Regner, who swept the northern sea with fleets,"
4370,III. FUNERAL.,"And ruled o’er Denmark and the heathy isles,"
4371,III. FUNERAL.,"Living; but Ella captured him and slew,--"
4372,III. FUNERAL.,"A king, whose fame then filled the vast of heaven:"
4373,III. FUNERAL.,"Now time obscures it, and men’s later deeds."
4374,III. FUNERAL.,"He last approached the corpse, and spake and said,--"
4375,III. FUNERAL.,"“Balder, there yet are many scalds in heaven"
4376,III. FUNERAL.,"Still left, and that chief scald, thy brother Brage,"
4377,III. FUNERAL.,"Whom we may bid to sing, though thou art gone."
4378,III. FUNERAL.,"And all these gladly, while we drink, we hear,"
4379,III. FUNERAL.,"After the feast is done, in Odin’s hall;"
4380,III. FUNERAL.,"But they harp ever on one string, and wake"
4381,III. FUNERAL.,"Remembrance in our soul of wars alone,"
4382,III. FUNERAL.,"Such as on earth we valiantly have waged,"
4383,III. FUNERAL.,"And blood, and ringing blows, and violent death."
4384,III. FUNERAL.,"But when thou sangest, Balder, thou didst strike"
4385,III. FUNERAL.,"Another note, and, like a bird in spring,"
4386,III. FUNERAL.,"Thy voice of joyance minded us, and youth,"
4387,III. FUNERAL.,"And wife, and children, and our ancient home."
4388,III. FUNERAL.,"Yes, and I too remembered then no more"
4389,III. FUNERAL.,"My dungeon, where the serpents stung me dead,"
4390,III. FUNERAL.,Nor Ella’s victory on the English coast;
4391,III. FUNERAL.,"But I heard Thora laugh in Gothland Isle,"
4392,III. FUNERAL.,"And saw my shepherdess, Aslauga, tend"
4393,III. FUNERAL.,Her flock along the white Norwegian beach.
4394,III. FUNERAL.,Tears started to mine eyes with yearning joy.
4395,III. FUNERAL.,Therefore with grateful heart I mourn thee dead.”
4396,III. FUNERAL.,"So Regner spake, and all the heroes groaned."
4397,III. FUNERAL.,"But now the sun had passed the height of heaven,"
4398,III. FUNERAL.,And soon had all that day been spent in wail;
4399,III. FUNERAL.,"But then the Father of the ages said,--"
4400,III. FUNERAL.,"“Ye gods, there well may be too much of wail!"
4401,III. FUNERAL.,Bring now the gathered wood to Balder’s ship;
4402,III. FUNERAL.,"Heap on the deck the logs, and build the pyre.”"
4403,III. FUNERAL.,"But when the gods and heroes heard, they brought"
4404,III. FUNERAL.,"The wood to Balder’s ship, and built a pile,"
4405,III. FUNERAL.,"Full the deck’s breadth, and lofty; then the corpse"
4406,III. FUNERAL.,"Of Balder on the highest top they laid,"
4407,III. FUNERAL.,"With Nanna on his right, and on his left"
4408,III. FUNERAL.,"Hoder, his brother, whom his own hand slew."
4409,III. FUNERAL.,And they set jars of wine and oil to lean
4410,III. FUNERAL.,"Against the bodies, and stuck torches near,"
4411,III. FUNERAL.,"Splinters of pine-wood, soaked with turpentine;"
4412,III. FUNERAL.,"And brought his arms and gold, and all his stuff,"
4413,III. FUNERAL.,"And slew the dogs who at his table fed,"
4414,III. FUNERAL.,"And his horse, Balder’s horse, whom most he loved,"
4415,III. FUNERAL.,And threw them on the pyre; and Odin threw
4416,III. FUNERAL.,"A last choice gift thereon, his golden ring."
4417,III. FUNERAL.,"The mast they fixed, and hoisted up the sails;"
4418,III. FUNERAL.,Then they put fire to the wood; and Thor
4419,III. FUNERAL.,Set his stout shoulder hard against the stern
4420,III. FUNERAL.,To push the ship through the thick sand; sparks flew
4421,III. FUNERAL.,"From the deep trench she ploughed, so strong a god"
4422,III. FUNERAL.,Furrowed it; and the water gurgled in.
4423,III. FUNERAL.,"And the ship floated on the waves, and rocked."
4424,III. FUNERAL.,"But in the hills a strong east-wind arose,"
4425,III. FUNERAL.,And came down moaning to the sea; first squalls
4426,III. FUNERAL.,"Ran black o’er the sea’s face, then steady rushed"
4427,III. FUNERAL.,"The breeze, and filled the sails, and blew the fire."
4428,III. FUNERAL.,And wreathed in smoke the ship stood out to sea.
4429,III. FUNERAL.,"Soon with a roaring rose the mighty fire,"
4430,III. FUNERAL.,And the pile crackled; and between the logs
4431,III. FUNERAL.,"Sharp quivering tongues of flame shot out, and leapt,"
4432,III. FUNERAL.,"Curling and darting, higher, until they licked"
4433,III. FUNERAL.,"The summit of the pile, the dead, the mast,"
4434,III. FUNERAL.,And ate the shrivelling sails; but still the ship
4435,III. FUNERAL.,"Drove on, ablaze above her hull with fire."
4436,III. FUNERAL.,"And the gods stood upon the beach, and gazed."
4437,III. FUNERAL.,"And while they gazed, the sun went lurid down"
4438,III. FUNERAL.,"Into the smoke-wrapt sea, and night came on."
4439,III. FUNERAL.,"Then the wind fell, with night, and there was calm;"
4440,III. FUNERAL.,But through the dark they watched the burning ship
4441,III. FUNERAL.,"Still carried o’er the distant waters on,"
4442,III. FUNERAL.,"Farther and farther, like an eye of fire."
4443,III. FUNERAL.,"And long, in the far dark, blazed Balder’s pile;"
4444,III. FUNERAL.,"But fainter, as the stars rose high, it flared;"
4445,III. FUNERAL.,"The bodies were consumed, ash choked the pile."
4446,III. FUNERAL.,"And as, in a decaying winter-fire,"
4447,III. FUNERAL.,"A charred log, falling, makes a shower of sparks,--"
4448,III. FUNERAL.,"So with a shower of sparks the pile fell in,"
4449,III. FUNERAL.,Reddening the sea around; and all was dark.
4450,III. FUNERAL.,But the gods went by starlight up the shore
4451,III. FUNERAL.,"To Asgard, and sate down in Odin’s hall"
4452,III. FUNERAL.,"At table, and the funeral-feast began."
4453,III. FUNERAL.,"All night they ate the boar Serimner’s flesh,"
4454,III. FUNERAL.,"And from their horns, with silver rimmed, drank mead,"
4455,III. FUNERAL.,"Silent, and waited for the sacred morn."
4456,III. FUNERAL.,And morning over all the world was spread.
4457,III. FUNERAL.,"Then from their loathèd feast the gods arose,"
4458,III. FUNERAL.,"And took their horses, and set forth to ride"
4459,III. FUNERAL.,"O’er the bridge Bifrost, where is Heimdall’s watch,"
4460,III. FUNERAL.,"To the ash Igdrasil, and Ida’s plain."
4461,III. FUNERAL.,"Thor came on foot, the rest on horseback rode."
4462,III. FUNERAL.,And they found Mimir sitting by his fount
4463,III. FUNERAL.,"Of wisdom, which beneath the ash-tree springs;"
4464,III. FUNERAL.,And saw the Nornies watering the roots
4465,III. FUNERAL.,Of that world-shadowing tree with honey-dew.
4466,III. FUNERAL.,"There came the gods, and sate them down on stones;"
4467,III. FUNERAL.,And thus the Father of the ages said:--
4468,III. FUNERAL.,"“Ye gods, the terms ye know, which Hermod brought."
4469,III. FUNERAL.,Accept them or reject them! both have grounds.
4470,III. FUNERAL.,"Accept them, and they bind us, unfulfilled,"
4471,III. FUNERAL.,"To leave forever Balder in the grave,"
4472,III. FUNERAL.,"An unrecovered prisoner, shade with shades."
4473,III. FUNERAL.,"But how, ye say, should the fulfilment fail?--"
4474,III. FUNERAL.,"Smooth sound the terms, and light to be fulfilled;"
4475,III. FUNERAL.,For dear-beloved was Balder while he lived
4476,III. FUNERAL.,"In heaven and earth, and who would grudge him tears?"
4477,III. FUNERAL.,"But from the traitorous seed of Lok they come,"
4478,III. FUNERAL.,"These terms, and I suspect some hidden fraud."
4479,III. FUNERAL.,"Bethink ye, gods, is there no other way?"
4480,III. FUNERAL.,"Speak, were not this a way, the way for gods,--"
4481,III. FUNERAL.,"If I, if Odin, clad in radiant arms,"
4482,III. FUNERAL.,"Mounted on Sleipner, with the warrior Thor"
4483,III. FUNERAL.,"Drawn in his car beside me, and my sons,"
4484,III. FUNERAL.,"All the strong brood of heaven, to swell my train,"
4485,III. FUNERAL.,"Should make irruption into Hela’s realm,"
4486,III. FUNERAL.,"And set the fields of gloom ablaze with light,"
4487,III. FUNERAL.,And bring in triumph Balder back to heaven?”
4488,III. FUNERAL.,"He spake, and his fierce sons applauded loud."
4489,III. FUNERAL.,"But Frea, mother of the gods, arose,"
4490,III. FUNERAL.,Daughter and wife of Odin; thus she said:--
4491,III. FUNERAL.,"“Odin, thou whirlwind, what a threat is this!"
4492,III. FUNERAL.,"Thou threatenest what transcends thy might, even thine."
4493,III. FUNERAL.,"For of all powers the mightiest far art thou,"
4494,III. FUNERAL.,"Lord over men on earth, and gods in heaven;"
4495,III. FUNERAL.,Yet even from thee thyself hath been withheld
4496,III. FUNERAL.,"One thing,--to undo what thou thyself hast ruled."
4497,III. FUNERAL.,For all which hath been fixed was fixed by thee.
4498,III. FUNERAL.,"In the beginning, ere the gods were born,"
4499,III. FUNERAL.,"Before the heavens were builded, thou didst slay"
4500,III. FUNERAL.,"The giant Ymir, whom the abyss brought forth,--"
4501,III. FUNERAL.,"Thou and thy brethren fierce, the sons of Bor,--"
4502,III. FUNERAL.,And cast his trunk to choke the abysmal void.
4503,III. FUNERAL.,But of his flesh and members thou didst build
4504,III. FUNERAL.,"The earth and ocean, and above them heaven."
4505,III. FUNERAL.,"And from the flaming world, where Muspel reigns,"
4506,III. FUNERAL.,"Thou sent’st and fetchedst fire, and madest lights,"
4507,III. FUNERAL.,"Sun, moon, and stars, which thou hast hung in heaven,"
4508,III. FUNERAL.,Dividing clear the paths of night and day.
4509,III. FUNERAL.,"And Asgard thou didst build, and Midgard fort;"
4510,III. FUNERAL.,Then me thou mad’st; of us the gods were born.
4511,III. FUNERAL.,"Last, walking by the sea, thou foundest spars"
4512,III. FUNERAL.,"Of wood, and framedst men, who till the earth,"
4513,III. FUNERAL.,"Or on the sea, the field of pirates, sail."
4514,III. FUNERAL.,"And all the race of Ymir thou didst drown,"
4515,III. FUNERAL.,"Save one, Bergelmer: he on shipboard fled"
4516,III. FUNERAL.,"Thy deluge, and from him the giants sprang."
4517,III. FUNERAL.,"But all that brood thou hast removed far off,"
4518,III. FUNERAL.,And set by ocean’s utmost marge to dwell.
4519,III. FUNERAL.,"But Hela into Niflheim thou threw’st,"
4520,III. FUNERAL.,"And gav’st her nine unlighted worlds to rule,"
4521,III. FUNERAL.,"A queen, and empire over all the dead."
4522,III. FUNERAL.,"That empire wilt thou now invade, light up"
4523,III. FUNERAL.,"Her darkness, from her grasp a subject tear?"
4524,III. FUNERAL.,"Try it; but I, for one, will not applaud."
4525,III. FUNERAL.,"Nor do I merit, Odin, thou shouldst slight"
4526,III. FUNERAL.,"Me and my words, though thou be first in heaven;"
4527,III. FUNERAL.,"For I too am a goddess, born of thee,"
4528,III. FUNERAL.,"Thine eldest, and of me the gods are sprung;"
4529,III. FUNERAL.,"And all that is to come I know, but lock"
4530,III. FUNERAL.,"In mine own breast, and have to none revealed."
4531,III. FUNERAL.,"Come, then! since Hela holds by right her prey,"
4532,III. FUNERAL.,"But offers terms for his release to heaven,"
4533,III. FUNERAL.,Accept the chance: thou canst no more obtain.
4534,III. FUNERAL.,Send through the world thy messengers; entreat
4535,III. FUNERAL.,All living and unliving things to weep
4536,III. FUNERAL.,For Balder: if thou haply thus may’st melt
4537,III. FUNERAL.,"Hela, and win the loved one back to heaven.”"
4538,III. FUNERAL.,"She spake, and on her face let fall her veil,"
4539,III. FUNERAL.,"And bowed her head, and sate with folded hands."
4540,III. FUNERAL.,Nor did the all-ruling Odin slight her word;
4541,III. FUNERAL.,"Straightway he spake, and thus addressed the gods:--"
4542,III. FUNERAL.,"“Go quickly forth through all the world, and pray"
4543,III. FUNERAL.,All living and unliving things to weep
4544,III. FUNERAL.,"Balder, if haply he may thus be won.”"
4545,III. FUNERAL.,"When the gods heard, they straight arose, and took"
4546,III. FUNERAL.,"Their horses, and rode forth through all the world."
4547,III. FUNERAL.,"North, south, east, west, they struck, and roamed the world,"
4548,III. FUNERAL.,Entreating all things to weep Balder’s death;
4549,III. FUNERAL.,"And all that lived, and all without life, wept."
4550,III. FUNERAL.,"And as in winter, when the frost breaks up,"
4551,III. FUNERAL.,"At winter’s end, before the spring begins,"
4552,III. FUNERAL.,"And a warm west-wind blows, and thaw sets in,"
4553,III. FUNERAL.,After an hour a dripping sound is heard
4554,III. FUNERAL.,"In all the forests, and the soft-strewn snow"
4555,III. FUNERAL.,"Under the trees is dibbled thick with holes,"
4556,III. FUNERAL.,And from the boughs the snow-loads shuffle down;
4557,III. FUNERAL.,"And, in fields sloping to the south, dark plots"
4558,III. FUNERAL.,"Of grass peep out amid surrounding snow,"
4559,III. FUNERAL.,"And widen, and the peasant’s heart is glad,--"
4560,III. FUNERAL.,So through the world was heard a dripping noise
4561,III. FUNERAL.,Of all things weeping to bring Balder back;
4562,III. FUNERAL.,And there fell joy upon the gods to hear.
4563,III. FUNERAL.,"But Hermod rode with Niord, whom he took"
4564,III. FUNERAL.,To show him spits and beaches of the sea
4565,III. FUNERAL.,"Far off, where some unwarned might fail to weep,--"
4566,III. FUNERAL.,"Niord, the god of storms, whom fishers know;"
4567,III. FUNERAL.,"Not born in heaven, he was in Vanheim reared,"
4568,III. FUNERAL.,"With men, but lives a hostage with the gods;"
4569,III. FUNERAL.,"He knows each frith, and every rocky creek"
4570,III. FUNERAL.,"Fringed with dark pines, and sands where seafowl scream,--"
4571,III. FUNERAL.,"They two scoured every coast, and all things wept."
4572,III. FUNERAL.,"And they rode home together, through the wood"
4573,III. FUNERAL.,"Of Jarnvid, which to east of Midgard lies"
4574,III. FUNERAL.,"Bordering the giants, where the trees are iron;"
4575,III. FUNERAL.,"There in the wood before a cave they came,"
4576,III. FUNERAL.,"Where sate, in the cave’s mouth, a skinny hag,"
4577,III. FUNERAL.,Toothless and old; she gibes the passers-by.
4578,III. FUNERAL.,"Thok is she called, but now Lok wore her shape."
4579,III. FUNERAL.,"She greeted them the first, and laughed, and said,--"
4580,III. FUNERAL.,"“Ye gods, good lack, is it so dull in heaven,"
4581,III. FUNERAL.,That ye come pleasuring to Thok’s iron wood?
4582,III. FUNERAL.,"Lovers of change ye are, fastidious sprites."
4583,III. FUNERAL.,"Look, as in some boor’s yard a sweet-breathed cow,"
4584,III. FUNERAL.,"Whose manger is stuffed full of good fresh hay,"
4585,III. FUNERAL.,"Snuffs at it daintily, and stoops her head"
4586,III. FUNERAL.,"To chew the straw, her litter, at her feet,--"
4587,III. FUNERAL.,"So ye grow squeamish, gods, and sniff at heaven!”"
4588,III. FUNERAL.,"She spake; but Hermod answered her, and said,--"
4589,III. FUNERAL.,"“Thok, not for gibes we come, we come for tears."
4590,III. FUNERAL.,"Balder is dead, and Hela holds her prey,"
4591,III. FUNERAL.,But will restore if all things give him tears.
4592,III. FUNERAL.,Begrudge not thine! to all was Balder dear.”
4593,III. FUNERAL.,"Then, with a louder laugh, the hag replied,--"
4594,III. FUNERAL.,“Is Balder dead? and do ye come for tears?
4595,III. FUNERAL.,Thok with dry eyes will weep o’er Balder’s pyre.
4596,III. FUNERAL.,"Weep him all other things, if weep they will:"
4597,III. FUNERAL.,I weep him not! let Hela keep her prey.”
4598,III. FUNERAL.,"She spake, and to the cavern’s depth she fled,"
4599,III. FUNERAL.,Mocking; and Hermod knew their toil was vain.
4600,III. FUNERAL.,"And as seafaring men, who long have wrought"
4601,III. FUNERAL.,"In the great deep for gain, at last come home,"
4602,III. FUNERAL.,And towards evening see the headlands rise
4603,III. FUNERAL.,"Of their dear country, and can plain descry"
4604,III. FUNERAL.,A fire of withered furze which boys have lit
4605,III. FUNERAL.,"Upon the cliffs, or smoke of burning weeds"
4606,III. FUNERAL.,Out of a tilled field inland: then the wind
4607,III. FUNERAL.,"Catches them, and drives out again to sea;"
4608,III. FUNERAL.,And they go long days tossing up and down
4609,III. FUNERAL.,"Over the gray sea-ridges, and the glimpse"
4610,III. FUNERAL.,"Of port they had makes bitterer far their toil,--"
4611,III. FUNERAL.,So the gods’ cross was bitterer for their joy.
4612,III. FUNERAL.,"Then, sad at heart, to Niord Hermod spake,--"
4613,III. FUNERAL.,"“It is the accuser Lok, who flouts us all!"
4614,III. FUNERAL.,"Ride back, and tell in heaven this heavy news;"
4615,III. FUNERAL.,"I must again below, to Hela’s realm.”"
4616,III. FUNERAL.,"He spoke, and Niord set forth back to heaven."
4617,III. FUNERAL.,"But northward Hermod rode, the way below,"
4618,III. FUNERAL.,"The way he knew; and traversed Giall’s stream,"
4619,III. FUNERAL.,"And down to ocean groped, and crossed the ice,"
4620,III. FUNERAL.,"And came beneath the wall, and found the grate"
4621,III. FUNERAL.,Still lifted: well was his return foreknown.
4622,III. FUNERAL.,And once more Hermod saw around him spread
4623,III. FUNERAL.,"The joyless plains, and heard the streams of hell."
4624,III. FUNERAL.,"But as he entered, on the extremest bound"
4625,III. FUNERAL.,"Of Niflheim, he saw one ghost come near,"
4626,III. FUNERAL.,"Hovering, and stopping oft, as if afraid,--"
4627,III. FUNERAL.,"Hoder, the unhappy, whom his own hand slew."
4628,III. FUNERAL.,"And Hermod looked, and knew his brother’s ghost,"
4629,III. FUNERAL.,"And called him by his name, and sternly said,--"
4630,III. FUNERAL.,"“Hoder, ill-fated, blind in heart and eyes!"
4631,III. FUNERAL.,Why tarriest thou to plunge thee in the gulf
4632,III. FUNERAL.,"Of the deep inner gloom, but flittest here,"
4633,III. FUNERAL.,"In twilight, on the lonely verge of hell,"
4634,III. FUNERAL.,"Far from the other ghosts, and Hela’s throne?"
4635,III. FUNERAL.,"Doubtless thou fearest to meet Balder’s voice,"
4636,III. FUNERAL.,"Thy brother, whom through folly thou didst slay.”"
4637,III. FUNERAL.,"He spoke; but Hoder answered him, and said,--"
4638,III. FUNERAL.,"“Hermod the nimble, dost thou still pursue"
4639,III. FUNERAL.,"The unhappy with reproach, even in the grave?"
4640,III. FUNERAL.,"For this I died, and fled beneath the gloom,"
4641,III. FUNERAL.,"Not daily to endure abhorring gods,"
4642,III. FUNERAL.,Nor with a hateful presence cumber heaven;
4643,III. FUNERAL.,"And canst thou not, even here, pass pitying by?"
4644,III. FUNERAL.,No less than Balder have I lost the light
4645,III. FUNERAL.,"Of heaven, and communion with my kin;"
4646,III. FUNERAL.,"I too had once a wife, and once a child,"
4647,III. FUNERAL.,"And substance, and a golden house in heaven:"
4648,III. FUNERAL.,"But all I left of my own act, and fled"
4649,III. FUNERAL.,Below; and dost thou hate me even here?
4650,III. FUNERAL.,"Balder upbraids me not, nor hates at all,"
4651,III. FUNERAL.,"Though he has cause, have any cause; but he,"
4652,III. FUNERAL.,"When that with downcast looks I hither came,"
4653,III. FUNERAL.,"Stretched forth his hand, and with benignant voice,"
4654,III. FUNERAL.,"_Welcome_, he said, _if there be welcome here,_"
4655,III. FUNERAL.,_Brother and fellow-sport of Lok with me!_
4656,III. FUNERAL.,"And not to offend thee, Hermod, nor to force"
4657,III. FUNERAL.,"My hated converse on thee, came I up"
4658,III. FUNERAL.,"From the deep gloom, where I will now return;"
4659,III. FUNERAL.,"But earnestly I longed to hover near,"
4660,III. FUNERAL.,"Not too far off, when that thou camest by;"
4661,III. FUNERAL.,"To feel the presence of a brother god,"
4662,III. FUNERAL.,"And hear the passage of a horse of heaven,"
4663,III. FUNERAL.,For the last time--for here thou com’st no more.”
4664,III. FUNERAL.,"He spake, and turned to go to the inner gloom."
4665,III. FUNERAL.,"But Hermod stayed him with mild words, and said,--"
4666,III. FUNERAL.,"“Thou doest well to chide me, Hoder blind!"
4667,III. FUNERAL.,"Truly thou say’st, the planning guilty mind"
4668,III. FUNERAL.,Was Lok’s: the unwitting hand alone was thine.
4669,III. FUNERAL.,But gods are like the sons of men in this:
4670,III. FUNERAL.,"When they have woe, they blame the nearest cause."
4671,III. FUNERAL.,"Howbeit stay, and be appeased; and tell,"
4672,III. FUNERAL.,"Sits Balder still in pomp by Hela’s side,"
4673,III. FUNERAL.,Or is he mingled with the unnumbered dead?”
4674,III. FUNERAL.,"And the blind Hoder answered him and spake,--"
4675,III. FUNERAL.,"“His place of state remains by Hela’s side,"
4676,III. FUNERAL.,"But empty; for his wife, for Nanna, came"
4677,III. FUNERAL.,"Lately below, and joined him; and the pair"
4678,III. FUNERAL.,Frequent the still recesses of the realm
4679,III. FUNERAL.,"Of Hela, and hold converse undisturbed."
4680,III. FUNERAL.,"But they too, doubtless, will have breathed the balm"
4681,III. FUNERAL.,"Which floats before a visitant from heaven,"
4682,III. FUNERAL.,And have drawn upward to this verge of hell.”
4683,III. FUNERAL.,"He spake; and, as he ceased, a puff of wind"
4684,III. FUNERAL.,Rolled heavily the leaden mist aside
4685,III. FUNERAL.,"Round where they stood, and they beheld two forms"
4686,III. FUNERAL.,Make toward them o’er the stretching cloudy plain.
4687,III. FUNERAL.,"And Hermod straight perceived them, who they were,--"
4688,III. FUNERAL.,"Balder and Nanna; and to Balder said,--"
4689,III. FUNERAL.,"“Balder, too truly thou foresaw’st a snare!"
4690,III. FUNERAL.,"Lok triumphs still, and Hela keeps her prey."
4691,III. FUNERAL.,"No more to Asgard shalt thou come, nor lodge"
4692,III. FUNERAL.,"In thy own house Breidablik, nor enjoy"
4693,III. FUNERAL.,"The love all bear toward thee, nor train up"
4694,III. FUNERAL.,"Forset, thy son, to be beloved like thee."
4695,III. FUNERAL.,"Here must thou lie, and wait an endless age."
4696,III. FUNERAL.,"Therefore for the last time, O Balder, hail!”"
4697,III. FUNERAL.,"He spake; and Balder answered him, and said,--"
4698,III. FUNERAL.,“Hail and farewell! for here thou com’st no more.
4699,III. FUNERAL.,"Yet mourn not for me, Hermod, when thou sitt’st"
4700,III. FUNERAL.,"In heaven, nor let the other gods lament,"
4701,III. FUNERAL.,"As wholly to be pitied, quite forlorn."
4702,III. FUNERAL.,"For Nanna hath rejoined me, who of old,"
4703,III. FUNERAL.,"In heaven, was seldom parted from my side;"
4704,III. FUNERAL.,"And still the acceptance follows me, which crowned"
4705,III. FUNERAL.,"My former life, and cheers me even here."
4706,III. FUNERAL.,The iron frown of Hela is relaxed
4707,III. FUNERAL.,"When I draw nigh, and the wan tribes of dead"
4708,III. FUNERAL.,"Love me, and gladly bring for my award"
4709,III. FUNERAL.,"Their ineffectual feuds and feeble hates,--"
4710,III. FUNERAL.,"Shadows of hates, but they distress them still.”"
4711,III. FUNERAL.,"And the fleet-footed Hermod made reply,--"
4712,III. FUNERAL.,"“Thou hast, then, all the solace death allows,--"
4713,III. FUNERAL.,Esteem and function; and so far is well.
4714,III. FUNERAL.,"Yet here thou liest, Balder, underground,"
4715,III. FUNERAL.,"Rusting forever; and the years roll on,"
4716,III. FUNERAL.,"The generations pass, the ages grow,"
4717,III. FUNERAL.,And bring us nearer to the final day
4718,III. FUNERAL.,"When from the south shall march the fiery band,"
4719,III. FUNERAL.,"And cross the bridge of heaven, with Lok for guide,"
4720,III. FUNERAL.,And Fenris at his heel with broken chain;
4721,III. FUNERAL.,While from the east the giant Rymer steers
4722,III. FUNERAL.,"His ship, and the great serpent makes to land;"
4723,III. FUNERAL.,And all are marshalled in one flaming square
4724,III. FUNERAL.,"Against the gods, upon the plains of heaven."
4725,III. FUNERAL.,"I mourn thee, that thou canst not help us then.”"
4726,III. FUNERAL.,"He spake; but Balder answered him, and said,--"
4727,III. FUNERAL.,"“Mourn not for me! Mourn, Hermod, for the gods;"
4728,III. FUNERAL.,"Mourn for the men on earth, the gods in heaven,"
4729,III. FUNERAL.,"Who live, and with their eyes shall see that day!"
4730,III. FUNERAL.,"The day will come, when fall shall Asgard’s towers,"
4731,III. FUNERAL.,"And Odin, and his sons, the seed of heaven;"
4732,III. FUNERAL.,"But what were I, to save them in that hour?"
4733,III. FUNERAL.,"If strength might save them, could not Odin save,"
4734,III. FUNERAL.,"My father, and his pride, the warrior Thor,"
4735,III. FUNERAL.,"Vidar the silent, the impetuous Tyr?"
4736,III. FUNERAL.,"I, what were I, when these can naught avail?"
4737,III. FUNERAL.,"Yet, doubtless, when the day of battle comes,"
4738,III. FUNERAL.,"And the two hosts are marshalled, and in heaven"
4739,III. FUNERAL.,"The golden-crested cock shall sound alarm,"
4740,III. FUNERAL.,"And his black brother-bird from hence reply,"
4741,III. FUNERAL.,"And bucklers clash, and spears begin to pour,--"
4742,III. FUNERAL.,"Longing will stir within my breast, though vain."
4743,III. FUNERAL.,"But not to me so grievous as, I know,"
4744,III. FUNERAL.,"To other gods it were, is my enforced"
4745,III. FUNERAL.,Absence from fields where I could nothing aid;
4746,III. FUNERAL.,For I am long since weary of your storm
4747,III. FUNERAL.,"Of carnage, and find, Hermod, in your life"
4748,III. FUNERAL.,"Something too much of war and broils, which make"
4749,III. FUNERAL.,"Life one perpetual fight, a bath of blood."
4750,III. FUNERAL.,Mine eyes are dizzy with the arrowy hail;
4751,III. FUNERAL.,"Mine ears are stunned with blows, and sick for calm."
4752,III. FUNERAL.,"Inactive therefore let me lie, in gloom,"
4753,III. FUNERAL.,"Unarmed, inglorious; I attend the course"
4754,III. FUNERAL.,"Of ages, and my late return to light,"
4755,III. FUNERAL.,"In times less alien to a spirit mild,"
4756,III. FUNERAL.,"In new-recovered seats, the happier day.”"
4757,III. FUNERAL.,"He spake, and the fleet Hermod thus replied:--"
4758,III. FUNERAL.,"“Brother, what seats are these, what happier day?"
4759,III. FUNERAL.,"Tell me, that I may ponder it when gone.”"
4760,III. FUNERAL.,"And the ray-crownèd Balder answered him,--"
4761,III. FUNERAL.,"“Far to the south, beyond the blue, there spreads"
4762,III. FUNERAL.,"Another heaven, the boundless. No one yet"
4763,III. FUNERAL.,Hath reached it. There hereafter shall arise
4764,III. FUNERAL.,"The second Asgard, with another name."
4765,III. FUNERAL.,"Thither, when o’er this present earth and heavens"
4766,III. FUNERAL.,"The tempest of the latter days hath swept,"
4767,III. FUNERAL.,"And they from sight have disappeared and sunk,"
4768,III. FUNERAL.,Shall a small remnant of the gods repair;
4769,III. FUNERAL.,Hoder and I shall join them from the grave.
4770,III. FUNERAL.,There re-assembling we shall see emerge
4771,III. FUNERAL.,From the bright ocean at our feet an earth
4772,III. FUNERAL.,"More fresh, more verdant than the last, with fruits"
4773,III. FUNERAL.,"Self-springing, and a seed of man preserved,"
4774,III. FUNERAL.,"Who then shall live in peace, as now in war."
4775,III. FUNERAL.,But we in heaven shall find again with joy
4776,III. FUNERAL.,"The ruined palaces of Odin, seats"
4777,III. FUNERAL.,"Familiar, halls where we have supped of old;"
4778,III. FUNERAL.,"Re-enter them with wonder, never fill"
4779,III. FUNERAL.,"Our eyes with gazing, and rebuild with tears."
4780,III. FUNERAL.,And we shall tread once more the well-known plain
4781,III. FUNERAL.,"Of Ida, and among the grass shall find"
4782,III. FUNERAL.,The golden dice wherewith we played of yore;
4783,III. FUNERAL.,And that will bring to mind the former life
4784,III. FUNERAL.,"And pastime of the gods, the wise discourse"
4785,III. FUNERAL.,"Of Odin, the delights of other days."
4786,III. FUNERAL.,"O Hermod, pray that thou may’st join us then!"
4787,III. FUNERAL.,"Such for the future is my hope; meanwhile,"
4788,III. FUNERAL.,"I rest the thrall of Hela, and endure"
4789,III. FUNERAL.,"Death, and the gloom which round me even now"
4790,III. FUNERAL.,"Thickens, and to its inner gulf recalls."
4791,III. FUNERAL.,"Farewell, for longer speech is not allowed!”"
4792,III. FUNERAL.,"He spoke, and waved farewell, and gave his hand"
4793,III. FUNERAL.,To Nanna; and she gave their brother blind
4794,III. FUNERAL.,"Her hand, in turn, for guidance; and the three"
4795,III. FUNERAL.,"Departed o’er the cloudy plain, and soon"
4796,III. FUNERAL.,Faded from sight into the interior gloom.
4797,III. FUNERAL.,"But Hermod stood beside his drooping horse,"
4798,III. FUNERAL.,"Mute, gazing after them in tears; and fain,"
4799,III. FUNERAL.,"Fain had he followed their receding steps,"
4800,III. FUNERAL.,"Though they to death were bound, and he to heaven,"
4801,III. FUNERAL.,Then: but a power he could not break withheld.
4802,III. FUNERAL.,"And as a stork which idle boys have trapped,"
4803,III. FUNERAL.,"And tied him in a yard, at autumn sees"
4804,III. FUNERAL.,Flocks of his kind pass flying o’er his head
4805,III. FUNERAL.,"To warmer lands, and coasts that keep the sun;"
4806,III. FUNERAL.,"He strains to join their flight, and from his shed"
4807,III. FUNERAL.,"Follows them with a long complaining cry,--"
4808,III. FUNERAL.,"So Hermod gazed, and yearned to join his kin."
4809,III. FUNERAL.,
4810,III. FUNERAL.,"At last he sighed, and set forth back to heaven."

4982,TRISTRAM.,For the surge-beat Cornish strand;
4983,TRISTRAM.,Where the prince whom she must wed
4984,TRISTRAM.,"Dwells on loud Tyntagel’s hill,"
4985,TRISTRAM.,High above the sounding sea.
4986,TRISTRAM.,And that golden cup her mother
4987,TRISTRAM.,"Gave her, that her future lord,"
4988,TRISTRAM.,"Gave her, that King Marc and she,"
4989,TRISTRAM.,"Might drink it on their marriage-day,"
4990,TRISTRAM.,"And forever love each other,--"
4991,TRISTRAM.,"Let her, as she sits on board,"
4992,TRISTRAM.,"--Ah! sweet saints, unwittingly!--"
4993,TRISTRAM.,"See it shine, and take it up,"
4994,TRISTRAM.,"And to Tristram laughing say,--"
4995,TRISTRAM.,"“Sir Tristram, of thy courtesy,"
4996,TRISTRAM.,Pledge me in my golden cup.”
4997,TRISTRAM.,Let them drink it; let their hands
4998,TRISTRAM.,"Tremble, and their cheeks be flame,"
4999,TRISTRAM.,As they feel the fatal bands
5000,TRISTRAM.,"Of a love they dare not name,"
5001,TRISTRAM.,"With a wild delicious pain,"
5002,TRISTRAM.,Twine about their hearts again!
5003,TRISTRAM.,Let the early summer be
5004,TRISTRAM.,"Once more round them, and the sea"
5005,TRISTRAM.,"Blue, and o’er its mirror kind"
5006,TRISTRAM.,"Let the breath of the May-wind,"
5007,TRISTRAM.,"Wandering through their drooping sails,"
5008,TRISTRAM.,Die on the green fields of Wales;
5009,TRISTRAM.,Let a dream like this restore
5010,TRISTRAM.,What his eye must see no more.
5011,TRISTRAM.,
5012,TRISTRAM.,TRISTRAM.
5013,TRISTRAM.,
5014,TRISTRAM.,"Chill blows the wind, the pleasaunce-walks are drear:"
5015,TRISTRAM.,"Madcap, what jest was this, to meet me here?"
5016,TRISTRAM.,Were feet like those made for so wild a way?
5017,TRISTRAM.,"The southern winter-parlor, by my fay,"
5018,TRISTRAM.,Had been the likeliest trysting-place to-day!--
5019,TRISTRAM.,"“_Tristram!--nay, nay--thou must not take my hand!--_"
5020,TRISTRAM.,_Tristram!--sweet love!--we are betrayed--out-planned._
5021,TRISTRAM.,_Fly--save thyself--save me! I dare not stay._”
5022,TRISTRAM.,One last kiss first!--“’_Tis vain--to horse--away!_”
5023,TRISTRAM.,
5024,TRISTRAM.,*       *       *       *       *
5025,TRISTRAM.,
5026,TRISTRAM.,"Ah! sweet saints, his dream doth move"
5027,TRISTRAM.,"Faster surely than it should,"
5028,TRISTRAM.,From the fever in his blood!
5029,TRISTRAM.,All the spring-time of his love
5030,TRISTRAM.,"Is already gone and past,"
5031,TRISTRAM.,And instead thereof is seen
5032,TRISTRAM.,"Its winter, which endureth still,--"
5033,TRISTRAM.,"Tyntagel on its surge-beat hill,"
5034,TRISTRAM.,"The pleasaunce-walks, the weeping queen,"
5035,TRISTRAM.,"The flying leaves, the straining blast,"
5036,TRISTRAM.,"And that long, wild kiss,--their last."
5037,TRISTRAM.,"And this rough December-night,"
5038,TRISTRAM.,"And his burning fever-pain,"
5039,TRISTRAM.,"Mingle with his hurrying dream,"
5040,TRISTRAM.,Till they rule it; till he seem
5041,TRISTRAM.,"The pressed fugitive again,"
5042,TRISTRAM.,"The love-desperate, banished knight,"
5043,TRISTRAM.,"With a fire in his brain,"
5044,TRISTRAM.,Flying o’er the stormy main.
5045,TRISTRAM.,--Whither does he wander now?
5046,TRISTRAM.,Haply in his dreams the wind
5047,TRISTRAM.,"Wafts him here, and lets him find"
5048,TRISTRAM.,The lovely orphan child again
5049,TRISTRAM.,In her castle by the coast;
5050,TRISTRAM.,"The youngest, fairest chatelaine,"
5051,TRISTRAM.,"That this realm of France can boast,"
5052,TRISTRAM.,"Our snowdrop by the Atlantic sea,--"
5053,TRISTRAM.,Iseult of Brittany.
5054,TRISTRAM.,"And--for through the haggard air,"
5055,TRISTRAM.,"The stained arms, the matted hair,"
5056,TRISTRAM.,"Of that stranger-knight ill-starred,"
5057,TRISTRAM.,There gleamed something which recalled
5058,TRISTRAM.,The Tristram who in better days
5059,TRISTRAM.,Was Launcelot’s guest at Joyous Gard--
5060,TRISTRAM.,"Welcomed here, and here installed,"
5061,TRISTRAM.,"Tended of his fever here,"
5062,TRISTRAM.,Haply he seems again to move
5063,TRISTRAM.,"His young guardian’s heart with love,"
5064,TRISTRAM.,"In his exiled loneliness,"
5065,TRISTRAM.,"In his stately, deep distress,"
5066,TRISTRAM.,"Without a word, without a tear."
5067,TRISTRAM.,--Ah! ’tis well he should retrace
5068,TRISTRAM.,His tranquil life in this lone place;
5069,TRISTRAM.,His gentle bearing at the side
5070,TRISTRAM.,Of his timid youthful bride;
5071,TRISTRAM.,His long rambles by the shore
5072,TRISTRAM.,"On winter-evenings, when the roar"
5073,TRISTRAM.,"Of the near waves came, sadly grand,"
5074,TRISTRAM.,"Through the dark, up the drowned sand;"
5075,TRISTRAM.,Or his endless reveries
5076,TRISTRAM.,"In the woods, where the gleams play"
5077,TRISTRAM.,"On the grass under the trees,"
5078,TRISTRAM.,Passing the long summer’s day
5079,TRISTRAM.,Idle as a mossy stone
5080,TRISTRAM.,"In the forest-depths alone,"
5081,TRISTRAM.,"The chase neglected, and his hound"
5082,TRISTRAM.,Couched beside him on the ground.
5083,TRISTRAM.,--Ah! what trouble’s on his brow?
5084,TRISTRAM.,Hither let him wander now;
5085,TRISTRAM.,"Hither, to the quiet hours"
5086,TRISTRAM.,Passed among these heaths of ours
5087,TRISTRAM.,"By the gray Atlantic sea,--"
5088,TRISTRAM.,"Hours, if not of ecstasy,"
5089,TRISTRAM.,From violent anguish surely free!
5090,TRISTRAM.,
5091,TRISTRAM.,TRISTRAM.
5092,TRISTRAM.,
5093,TRISTRAM.,"All red with blood the whirling river flows,"
5094,TRISTRAM.,"The wide plain rings, the dazed air throbs with blows."
5095,TRISTRAM.,Upon us are the chivalry of Rome;
5096,TRISTRAM.,"Their spears are down, their steeds are bathed in foam."
5097,TRISTRAM.,"“Up, Tristram, up!” men cry, “thou moonstruck knight!"
5098,TRISTRAM.,What foul fiend rides thee? On into the fight!”
5099,TRISTRAM.,"--Above the din, her voice is in my ears;"
5100,TRISTRAM.,I see her form glide through the crossing spears.--
5101,TRISTRAM.,Iseult!...
5102,TRISTRAM.,
5103,TRISTRAM.,Ah! he wanders forth again;
5104,TRISTRAM.,"We cannot keep him: now, as then,"
5105,TRISTRAM.,There’s a secret in his breast
5106,TRISTRAM.,Which will never let him rest.
5107,TRISTRAM.,"These musing fits in the green wood,"
5108,TRISTRAM.,"They cloud the brain, they dull the blood!"
5109,TRISTRAM.,"--His sword is sharp, his horse is good;"
5110,TRISTRAM.,Beyond the mountains will he see
5111,TRISTRAM.,"The famous towns of Italy,"
5112,TRISTRAM.,And label with the blessed sign
5113,TRISTRAM.,The heathen Saxons on the Rhine.
5114,TRISTRAM.,At Arthur’s side he fights once more
5115,TRISTRAM.,With the Roman Emperor.
5116,TRISTRAM.,There’s many a gay knight where he goes
5117,TRISTRAM.,Will help him to forget his care;
5118,TRISTRAM.,"The march, the leaguer, heaven’s blithe air,"
5119,TRISTRAM.,"The neighing steeds, the ringing blows,--"
5120,TRISTRAM.,Sick pining comes not where these are.
5121,TRISTRAM.,"--Ah! what boots it, that the jest"
5122,TRISTRAM.,"Lightens every other brow,"
5123,TRISTRAM.,"What, that every other breast"
5124,TRISTRAM.,"Dances as the trumpets blow,"
5125,TRISTRAM.,If one’s own heart beats not light
5126,TRISTRAM.,"On the waves of the tossed fight,"
5127,TRISTRAM.,If one’s self cannot get free
5128,TRISTRAM.,From the clog of misery?
5129,TRISTRAM.,Thy lovely youthful wife grows pale
5130,TRISTRAM.,"Watching by the salt sea-tide,"
5131,TRISTRAM.,"With her children at her side,"
5132,TRISTRAM.,For the gleam of thy white sail.
5133,TRISTRAM.,"Home, Tristram, to thy halls again!"
5134,TRISTRAM.,"To our lonely sea complain,"
5135,TRISTRAM.,To our forests tell thy pain.
5136,TRISTRAM.,
5137,TRISTRAM.,TRISTRAM.
5138,TRISTRAM.,
5139,TRISTRAM.,"All round the forest sweeps off, black in shade,"
5140,TRISTRAM.,But it is moonlight in the open glade;
5141,TRISTRAM.,And in the bottom of the glade shine clear
5142,TRISTRAM.,The forest-chapel and the fountain near.
5143,TRISTRAM.,--I think I have a fever in my blood;
5144,TRISTRAM.,"Come, let me leave the shadow of this wood,"
5145,TRISTRAM.,"Ride down, and bathe my hot brow in the flood."
5146,TRISTRAM.,--Mild shines the cold spring in the moon’s clear light.
5147,TRISTRAM.,God! ’tis _her_ face plays in the waters bright!
5148,TRISTRAM.,"“Fair love,” she says, “canst thou forget so soon,"
5149,TRISTRAM.,"At this soft hour, under this sweet moon?”--"
5150,TRISTRAM.,Iseult!...
5151,TRISTRAM.,
5152,TRISTRAM.,"Ah, poor soul! if this be so,"
5153,TRISTRAM.,Only death can balm thy woe.
5154,TRISTRAM.,The solitudes of the green wood
5155,TRISTRAM.,Had no medicine for thy mood;
5156,TRISTRAM.,The rushing battle cleared thy blood
5157,TRISTRAM.,As little as did solitude.
5158,TRISTRAM.,--Ah! his eyelids slowly break
5159,TRISTRAM.,"Their hot seals, and let him wake;"
5160,TRISTRAM.,What new change shall we now see?
5161,TRISTRAM.,A happier? Worse it cannot be.
5162,TRISTRAM.,
5163,TRISTRAM.,TRISTRAM.
5164,TRISTRAM.,
5165,TRISTRAM.,"Is my page here? Come, turn me to the fire!"
5166,TRISTRAM.,Upon the window-panes the moon shines bright;
5167,TRISTRAM.,The wind is down; but she’ll not come to-night.
5168,TRISTRAM.,"Ah, no! she is asleep in Cornwall now,"
5169,TRISTRAM.,"Far hence; her dreams are fair, smooth is her brow."
5170,TRISTRAM.,"Of me she recks not, nor my vain desire."
5171,TRISTRAM.,"--I have had dreams, I have had dreams, my page,"
5172,TRISTRAM.,Would take a score years from a strong man’s age;
5173,TRISTRAM.,"And with a blood like mine, will leave, I fear,"
5174,TRISTRAM.,Scant leisure for a second messenger.
5175,TRISTRAM.,"--My princess, art thou there? Sweet, ’tis too late!"
5176,TRISTRAM.,"To bed, and sleep! my fever is gone by;"
5177,TRISTRAM.,To-night my page shall keep me company.
5178,TRISTRAM.,Where do the children sleep? kiss them for me!
5179,TRISTRAM.,"Poor child, thou art almost as pale as I:"
5180,TRISTRAM.,This comes of nursing long and watching late.
5181,TRISTRAM.,To bed--good night!
5182,TRISTRAM.,
5183,TRISTRAM.,"She left the gleam-lit fireplace,"
5184,TRISTRAM.,She came to the bedside;
5185,TRISTRAM.,"She took his hands in hers, her tears"
5186,TRISTRAM.,Down on her slender fingers rained.
5187,TRISTRAM.,"She raised her eyes upon his face,"
5188,TRISTRAM.,"Not with a look of wounded pride,"
5189,TRISTRAM.,A look as if the heart complained;
5190,TRISTRAM.,"Her look was like a sad embrace,--"
5191,TRISTRAM.,The gaze of one who can divine
5192,TRISTRAM.,"A grief, and sympathize."
5193,TRISTRAM.,Sweet flower! thy children’s eyes
5194,TRISTRAM.,Are not more innocent than thine.
5195,TRISTRAM.,
5196,TRISTRAM.,"But they sleep in sheltered rest,"
5197,TRISTRAM.,"Like helpless birds in the warm nest,"
5198,TRISTRAM.,On the castle’s southern side;
5199,TRISTRAM.,Where feebly comes the mournful roar
5200,TRISTRAM.,Of buffeting wind and surging tide
5201,TRISTRAM.,Through many a room and corridor.
5202,TRISTRAM.,--Full on their window the moon’s ray
5203,TRISTRAM.,Makes their chamber as bright as day.
5204,TRISTRAM.,"It shines upon the blank white walls,"
5205,TRISTRAM.,"And on the snowy pillow falls,"
5206,TRISTRAM.,And on two angel-heads doth play
5207,TRISTRAM.,"Turned to each other; the eyes closed,"
5208,TRISTRAM.,The lashes on the cheeks reposed.
5209,TRISTRAM.,Round each sweet brow the cap close-set
5210,TRISTRAM.,Hardly lets peep the golden hair;
5211,TRISTRAM.,"Through the soft-opened lips, the air"
5212,TRISTRAM.,Scarcely moves the coverlet.
5213,TRISTRAM.,One little wandering arm is thrown
5214,TRISTRAM.,"At random on the counterpane,"
5215,TRISTRAM.,And often the fingers close in haste
5216,TRISTRAM.,As if their baby-owner chased
5217,TRISTRAM.,The butterflies again.
5218,TRISTRAM.,"This stir they have, and this alone;"
5219,TRISTRAM.,But else they are so still!
5220,TRISTRAM.,"--Ah, tired madcaps! you lie still;"
5221,TRISTRAM.,"But were you at the window now,"
5222,TRISTRAM.,To look forth on the fairy sight
5223,TRISTRAM.,"Of your illumined haunts by night,"
5224,TRISTRAM.,To see the park-glades where you play
5225,TRISTRAM.,"Far lovelier than they are by day,"
5226,TRISTRAM.,"To see the sparkle on the eaves,"
5227,TRISTRAM.,And upon every giant-bough
5228,TRISTRAM.,"Of those old oaks, whose wet red leaves"
5229,TRISTRAM.,"Are jewelled with bright drops of rain,--"
5230,TRISTRAM.,How would your voices run again!
5231,TRISTRAM.,And far beyond the sparkling trees
5232,TRISTRAM.,"Of the castle-park, one sees"
5233,TRISTRAM.,"The bare heaths spreading, clear as day,"
5234,TRISTRAM.,"Moor behind moor, far, far away,"
5235,TRISTRAM.,Into the heart of Brittany.
5236,TRISTRAM.,"And here and there, locked by the land,"
5237,TRISTRAM.,"Long inlets of smooth glittering sea,"
5238,TRISTRAM.,And many a stretch of watery sand
5239,TRISTRAM.,All shining in the white moonbeams.
5240,TRISTRAM.,But you see fairer in your dreams!
5241,TRISTRAM.,What voices are these on the clear night air?

5398,TRISTRAM.,She will grant it; she is kind and good.
5399,TRISTRAM.,
5400,TRISTRAM.,Now to sail the seas of death I leave thee--
5401,TRISTRAM.,One last kiss upon the living shore!

5410,ISEULT.,You see them clear--the moon shines bright.
5411,ISEULT.,"Slow, slow and softly, where she stood,"
5412,ISEULT.,She sinks upon the ground; her hood
5413,ISEULT.,"Had fallen back, her arms outspread"
5414,ISEULT.,Still hold her lover’s hands; her head
5415,ISEULT.,"Is bowed, half-buried, on the bed."
5416,ISEULT.,"O’er the blanched sheet, her raven hair"
5417,ISEULT.,"Lies in disordered streams; and there,"
5418,ISEULT.,"Strung like white stars, the pearls still are;"
5419,ISEULT.,"And the golden bracelets, heavy and rare,"
5420,ISEULT.,"Flash on her white arms still,--"
5421,ISEULT.,The very same which yesternight
5422,ISEULT.,"Flashed in the silver sconces’ light,"
5423,ISEULT.,When the feast was gay and the laughter loud
5424,ISEULT.,In Tyntagel’s palace proud.
5425,ISEULT.,But then they decked a restless ghost
5426,ISEULT.,"With hot-flushed cheeks and brilliant eyes,"
5427,ISEULT.,And quivering lips on which the tide
5428,ISEULT.,"Of courtly speech abruptly died,"
5429,ISEULT.,"And a glance which over the crowded floor,"
5430,ISEULT.,"The dancers, and the festive host,"
5431,ISEULT.,Flew ever to the door;
5432,ISEULT.,"That the knights eyed her in surprise,"
5433,ISEULT.,"And the dames whispered scoffingly,--"
5434,ISEULT.,"“Her moods, good lack, they pass like showers!"
5435,ISEULT.,But yesternight and she would be
5436,ISEULT.,As pale and still as withered flowers;
5437,ISEULT.,"And now to-night she laughs and speaks,"
5438,ISEULT.,And has a color in her cheeks.
5439,ISEULT.,Christ keep us from such fantasy!”--
5440,ISEULT.,
5441,ISEULT.,"Yes, now the longing is o’erpast,"
5442,ISEULT.,"Which, dogged by fear and fought by shame."
5443,ISEULT.,"Shook her weak bosom day and night,"
5444,ISEULT.,"Consumed her beauty like a flame,"
5445,ISEULT.,And dimmed it like the desert-blast.
5446,ISEULT.,"And though the curtains hide her face,"
5447,ISEULT.,"Yet, were it lifted to the light,"
5448,ISEULT.,The sweet expression of her brow
5449,ISEULT.,"Would charm the gazer, till his thought"
5450,ISEULT.,"Erased the ravages of time,"
5451,ISEULT.,"Filled up the hollow cheek, and brought"
5452,ISEULT.,"A freshness back as of her prime,--"
5453,ISEULT.,So healing is her quiet now;
5454,ISEULT.,So perfectly the lines express
5455,ISEULT.,"A tranquil, settled loveliness,"
5456,ISEULT.,Her younger rival’s purest grace.
5457,ISEULT.,
5458,ISEULT.,The air of the December-night
5459,ISEULT.,"Steals coldly around the chamber bright,"
5460,ISEULT.,Where those lifeless lovers be.
5461,ISEULT.,"Swinging with it, in the light"
5462,ISEULT.,Flaps the ghost-like tapestry.
5463,ISEULT.,And on the arras wrought you see
5464,ISEULT.,"A stately huntsman, clad in green,"
5465,ISEULT.,And round him a fresh forest-scene.
5466,ISEULT.,"On that clear forest-knoll he stays,"
5467,ISEULT.,"With his pack round him, and delays."
5468,ISEULT.,"He stares and stares, with troubled face,"
5469,ISEULT.,"At this huge, gleam-lit fireplace,"
5470,ISEULT.,"At that bright, iron-figured door,"
5471,ISEULT.,And those blown rushes on the floor.
5472,ISEULT.,He gazes down into the room
5473,ISEULT.,"With heated cheeks and flurried air,"
5474,ISEULT.,"And to himself he seems to say,--"
5475,ISEULT.,"“_What place is this, and who are they?_"
5476,ISEULT.,_Who is that kneeling lady fair?_
5477,ISEULT.,_And on his pillows that pale knight_
5478,ISEULT.,_Who seems of marble on a tomb?_
5479,ISEULT.,"_How comes it here, this chamber bright,_"
5480,ISEULT.,_Through whose mullioned windows clear_
5481,ISEULT.,"_The castle-court all wet with rain,_"
5482,ISEULT.,"_The drawbridge and the moat appear,_"
5483,ISEULT.,"_And then the beach, and, marked with spray,_"
5484,ISEULT.,"_The sunken reefs, and far away_"
5485,ISEULT.,_The unquiet bright Atlantic plain?_
5486,ISEULT.,"_--What! has some glamour made me sleep,_"
5487,ISEULT.,"_And sent me with my dogs to sweep,_"
5488,ISEULT.,"_By night, with boisterous bugle-peal,_"
5489,ISEULT.,"_Through some old, sea-side, knightly hall,_"
5490,ISEULT.,_Not in the free green wood at all?_
5491,ISEULT.,"_That knight’s asleep, and at her prayer_"
5492,ISEULT.,_That lady by the bed doth kneel--_
5493,ISEULT.,"_Then hush, thou boisterous bugle-peal!_"
5494,ISEULT.,--The wild boar rustles in his lair;
5495,ISEULT.,The fierce hounds snuff the tainted air;
5496,ISEULT.,But lord and hounds keep rooted there.
5497,ISEULT.,
5498,ISEULT.,"Cheer, cheer thy dogs into the brake,"
5499,ISEULT.,O hunter! and without a fear
5500,ISEULT.,"Thy golden-tasselled bugle blow,"
5501,ISEULT.,And through the glades thy pastime take--
5502,ISEULT.,For thou wilt rouse no sleepers here!
5503,ISEULT.,For these thou seest are unmoved;

5515,III.,
5516,III.,
5517,III.,"A year had flown, and o’er the sea away,"
5518,III.,"In Cornwall, Tristram and Queen Iseult lay;"
5519,III.,"In King Marc’s chapel, in Tyntagel old:"
5520,III.,There in a ship they bore those lovers cold.
5521,III.,
5522,III.,"The young surviving Iseult, one bright day,"
5523,III.,Had wandered forth. Her children were at play
5524,III.,In a green circular hollow in the heath
5525,III.,Which borders the seashore; a country path
5526,III.,Creeps over it from the tilled fields behind.
5527,III.,The hollow’s grassy banks are soft-inclined;
5528,III.,"And to one standing on them, far and near"
5529,III.,The lone unbroken view spreads bright and clear
5530,III.,Over the waste. This cirque of open ground
5531,III.,"Is light and green; the heather, which all round"
5532,III.,"Creeps thickly, grows not here; but the pale grass"
5533,III.,Is strewn with rocks and many a shivered mass
5534,III.,"Of veined white-gleaming quartz, and here and there"
5535,III.,Dotted with holly-trees and juniper.
5536,III.,In the smooth centre of the opening stood
5537,III.,"Three hollies side by side, and made a screen,"
5538,III.,"Warm with the winter-sun, of burnished green"
5539,III.,"With scarlet berries gemmed, the fell-fare’s food."
5540,III.,"Under the glittering hollies Iseult stands,"
5541,III.,Watching her children play: their little hands
5542,III.,"Are busy gathering spars of quartz, and streams"
5543,III.,"Of stagshorn for their hats; anon, with screams"
5544,III.,"Of mad delight they drop their spoils, and bound"
5545,III.,"Among the holly-clumps and broken ground,"
5546,III.,"Racing full speed, and startling in their rush"
5547,III.,The fell-fares and the speckled missel-thrush
5548,III.,Out of their glossy coverts; but when now
5549,III.,"Their cheeks were flushed, and over each hot brow,"
5550,III.,"Under the feathered hats of the sweet pair,"
5551,III.,"In blinding masses showered the golden hair,"
5552,III.,"Then Iseult called them to her, and the three"
5553,III.,"Clustered under the holly-screen, and she"
5554,III.,Told them an old-world Breton history.
5555,III.,
5556,III.,"Warm in their mantles wrapped, the three stood there,"
5557,III.,"Under the hollies, in the clear still air,--"
5558,III.,Mantles with those rich furs deep glistering
5559,III.,Which Venice ships do from swart Egypt bring.
5560,III.,"Long they stayed still, then, pacing at their ease,"
5561,III.,Moved up and down under the glossy trees;
5562,III.,"But still, as they pursued their warm dry road,"
5563,III.,"From Iseult’s lips the unbroken story flowed,"
5564,III.,"And still the children listened, their blue eyes"
5565,III.,Fixed on their mother’s face in wide surprise.
5566,III.,"Nor did their looks stray once to the sea-side,"
5567,III.,"Nor to the brown heaths round them, bright and wide,"
5568,III.,"Nor to the snow, which, though ’twas all away"
5569,III.,"From the open heath, still by the hedgerows lay,"
5570,III.,"Nor to the shining sea-fowl, that with screams"
5571,III.,"Bore up from where the bright Atlantic gleams,"
5572,III.,"Swooping to landward; nor to where, quite clear,"
5573,III.,The fell-fares settled on the thickets near.
5574,III.,"And they would still have listened, till dark night"
5575,III.,Came keen and chill down on the heather bright;
5576,III.,"But when the red glow on the sea grew cold,"
5577,III.,And the gray turrets of the castle old
5578,III.,"Looked sternly through the frosty evening-air,"
5579,III.,"Then Iseult took by the hand those children fair,"
5580,III.,"And brought her tale to an end, and found the path,"
5581,III.,And led them home over the darkening heath.
5582,III.,And is she happy? Does she see unmoved
5583,III.,The days in which she might have lived and loved
5584,III.,"Slip without bringing bliss slowly away,"
5585,III.,"One after one, to-morrow like to-day?"
5586,III.,"Joy has not found her yet, nor ever will:"
5587,III.,"Is it this thought which makes her mien so still,"
5588,III.,"Her features so fatigued, her eyes, though sweet,"
5589,III.,"So sunk, so rarely lifted save to meet"
5590,III.,Her children’s? She moves slow; her voice alone
5591,III.,"Hath yet an infantine and silver tone,"
5592,III.,"But even that comes languidly; in truth,"
5593,III.,She seems one dying in a mask of youth.
5594,III.,"And now she will go home, and softly lay"
5595,III.,"Her laughing children in their beds, and play"
5596,III.,A while with them before they sleep; and then
5597,III.,"She’ll light her silver lamp,--which fishermen"
5598,III.,"Dragging their nets through the rough waves afar,"
5599,III.,"Along this iron coast, know like a star,--"
5600,III.,"And take her broidery-frame, and there she’ll sit"
5601,III.,"Hour after hour, her gold curls sweeping it;"
5602,III.,Lifting her soft-bent head only to mind
5603,III.,"Her children, or to listen to the wind."
5604,III.,"And when the clock peals midnight, she will move"
5605,III.,"Her work away, and let her fingers rove"
5606,III.,"Across the shaggy brows of Tristram’s hound,"
5607,III.,"Who lies, guarding her feet, along the ground;"
5608,III.,"Or else she will fall musing, her blue eyes"
5609,III.,"Fixed, her slight hands clasped on her lap; then rise,"
5610,III.,"And at her prie-dieu kneel, until she have told"
5611,III.,Her rosary-beads of ebony tipped with gold;
5612,III.,Then to her soft sleep--and to-morrow’ll be
5613,III.,To-day’s exact repeated effigy.
5614,III.,"Yes, it is lonely for her in her hall."
5615,III.,"The children, and the gray-haired seneschal,"
5616,III.,"Her women, and Sir Tristram’s aged hound,"
5617,III.,Are there the sole companions to be found.
5618,III.,But these she loves; and noisier life than this
5619,III.,"She would find ill to bear, weak as she is."
5620,III.,"She has her children, too, and night and day"
5621,III.,"Is with them; and the wide heaths where they play,"
5622,III.,"The hollies, and the cliff, and the sea-shore,"
5623,III.,"The sand, the sea-birds, and the distant sails,"
5624,III.,These are to her dear as to them; the tales
5625,III.,With which this day the children she beguiled
5626,III.,"She gleaned from Breton grandames, when a child,"
5627,III.,In every hut along this sea-coast wild;
5628,III.,"She herself loves them still, and, when they are told,"
5629,III.,"Can forget all to hear them, as of old."
5630,III.,
5631,III.,"Dear saints, it is not sorrow, as I hear,"
5632,III.,"Not suffering, which shuts up eye and ear"
5633,III.,"To all that has delighted them before,"
5634,III.,And lets us be what we were once no more.
5635,III.,"No: we may suffer deeply, yet retain"
5636,III.,"Power to be moved and soothed, for all our pain,"
5637,III.,"By what of old pleased us, and will again."
5638,III.,"No: ’tis the gradual furnace of the world,"
5639,III.,In whose hot air our spirits are upcurled
5640,III.,"Until they crumble, or else grow like steel,"
5641,III.,"Which kills in us the bloom, the youth, the spring;"
5642,III.,"Which leaves the fierce necessity to feel,"
5643,III.,"But takes away the power: this can avail,"
5644,III.,"By drying up our joy in every thing,"
5645,III.,To make our former pleasures all seem stale.
5646,III.,"This, or some tyrannous single thought, some fit"
5647,III.,"Of passion, which subdues our souls to it,"
5648,III.,"Till for its sake alone we live and move,--"
5649,III.,"Call it ambition, or remorse, or love,--"
5650,III.,"This too can change us wholly, and make seem"
5651,III.,"All which we did before, shadow and dream."
5652,III.,"And yet, I swear, it angers me to see"
5653,III.,How this fool passion gulls men potently;
5654,III.,"Being, in truth, but a diseased unrest,"
5655,III.,And an unnatural overheat at best.
5656,III.,How they are full of languor and distress
5657,III.,"Not having it; which when they do possess,"
5658,III.,"They straightway are burnt up with fume and care,"
5659,III.,And spend their lives in posting here and there
5660,III.,"Where this plague drives them; and have little ease,"
5661,III.,"Are furious with themselves, and hard to please."
5662,III.,"Like that bald Cæsar, the famed Roman wight,"
5663,III.,Who wept at reading of a Grecian knight
5664,III.,Who made a name at younger years than he;
5665,III.,"Or that renowned mirror of chivalry,"
5666,III.,"Prince Alexander, Philip’s peerless son,"
5667,III.,Who carried the great war from Macedon
5668,III.,"Into the Soudan’s realm, and thundered on"
5669,III.,To die at thirty-five in Babylon.
5670,III.,
5671,III.,"What tale did Iseult to the children say,"
5672,III.,"Under the hollies, that bright winter’s day?"
5673,III.,
5674,III.,She told them of the fairy-haunted land
5675,III.,"Away the other side of Brittany,"
5676,III.,"Beyond the heaths, edged by the lonely sea;"
5677,III.,"Of the deep forest-glades of Broce-liande,"
5678,III.,"Through whose green boughs the golden sunshine creeps,"
5679,III.,Where Merlin by the enchanted thorn-tree sleeps.
5680,III.,"For here he came with the fay Vivian,"
5681,III.,"One April, when the warm days first began."
5682,III.,"He was on foot, and that false fay, his friend,"
5683,III.,"On her white palfrey; here he met his end,"
5684,III.,"In these lone sylvan glades, that April-day."
5685,III.,This tale of Merlin and the lovely fay
5686,III.,"Was the one Iseult chose, and she brought clear"
5687,III.,Before the children’s fancy him and her.
5688,III.,
5689,III.,"Blowing between the stems, the forest-air"
5690,III.,"Had loosened the brown locks of Vivian’s hair,"
5691,III.,"Which played on her flushed cheek, and her blue eyes"
5692,III.,Sparkled with mocking glee and exercise.
5693,III.,"Her palfrey’s flanks were mired and bathed in sweat,"
5694,III.,For they had travelled far and not stopped yet.
5695,III.,A brier in that tangled wilderness
5696,III.,"Had scored her white right hand, which she allows"
5697,III.,To rest ungloved on her green riding-dress;
5698,III.,The other warded off the drooping boughs.
5699,III.,"But still she chatted on, with her blue eyes"
5700,III.,"Fixed full on Merlin’s face, her stately prize."
5701,III.,"Her ’havior had the morning’s fresh clear grace,"
5702,III.,The spirit of the woods was in her face;
5703,III.,"She looked so witching fair, that learned wight"
5704,III.,"Forgot his craft, and his best wits took flight,"
5705,III.,"And he grew fond, and eager to obey"
5706,III.,"His mistress, use her empire as she may."
5707,III.,
5708,III.,"They came to where the brushwood ceased, and day"
5709,III.,Peered ’twixt the stems; and the ground broke away
5710,III.,In a sloped sward down to a brawling brook.
5711,III.,And up as high as where they stood to look
5712,III.,On the brook’s farther side was clear; but then
5713,III.,The underwood and trees began again.
5714,III.,This open glen was studded thick with thorns
5715,III.,"Then white with blossom; and you saw the horns,"
5716,III.,"Through last year’s fern, of the shy fallow-deer"
5717,III.,Who come at noon down to the water here.
5718,III.,You saw the bright-eyed squirrels dart along
5719,III.,Under the thorns on the green sward; and strong
5720,III.,"The blackbird whistled from the dingles near,"
5721,III.,And the weird chipping of the woodpecker
5722,III.,"Rang lonelily and sharp; the sky was fair,"
5723,III.,And a fresh breath of spring stirred everywhere.
5724,III.,"Merlin and Vivian stopped on the slope’s brow,"
5725,III.,To gaze on the light sea of leaf and bough
5726,III.,"Which glistering plays all round them, lone and mild,"
5727,III.,As if to itself the quiet forest smiled.
5728,III.,"Upon the brow-top grew a thorn, and here"
5729,III.,"The grass was dry and mossed, and you saw clear"
5730,III.,Across the hollow; white anemones
5731,III.,"Starred the cool turf, and clumps of primroses"
5732,III.,Ran out from the dark underwood behind.
5733,III.,No fairer resting-place a man could find.
5734,III.,"“Here let us halt,” said Merlin then; and she"
5735,III.,"Nodded, and tied her palfrey to a tree."
5736,III.,
5737,III.,"They sate them down together, and a sleep"
5738,III.,"Fell upon Merlin, more like death, so deep."
5739,III.,"Her finger on her lips, then Vivian rose,"
5740,III.,"And from her brown-locked head the wimple throws,"
5741,III.,"And takes it in her hand, and waves it over"
5742,III.,The blossomed thorn-tree and her sleeping lover.
5743,III.,"Nine times she waved the fluttering wimple round,"
5744,III.,And made a little plot of magic ground.
5745,III.,"And in that daisied circle, as men say,"
5746,III.,Is Merlin prisoner till the judgment-day;
5747,III.,But she herself whither she will can rove--
5748,III.,For she was passing weary of his love.

6019,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"We went up the beach, by the sandy down"

6021,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Through the narrow paved streets, where all was still,"
6022,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,To the little gray church on the windy hill.
6023,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"From the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers,"
6024,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,But we stood without in the cold blowing airs.
6025,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"We climbed on the graves, on the stones worn with rains,"
6026,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,And we gazed up the aisle through the small leaded panes.
6027,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,She sate by the pillar; we saw her clear:
6028,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"“Margaret, hist! come quick, we are here!"
6029,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Dear heart,” I said, “we are long alone;"
6030,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan.”"
6031,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"But, ah! she gave me never a look,"
6032,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,For her eyes were sealed to the holy book.
6033,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,Loud prays the priest; shut stands the door.
6034,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Come away, children, call no more!"
6035,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Come away, come down, call no more!"
6036,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,
6037,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Down, down, down!"
6038,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,Down to the depths of the sea!
6039,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"She sits at her wheel in the humming town,"
6040,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,Singing most joyfully.
6041,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Hark what she sings: “O joy, O joy,"
6042,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"For the humming street, and the child with its toy!"
6043,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"For the priest, and the bell, and the holy well;"
6044,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"For the wheel where I spun,"
6045,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,And the blessed light of the sun!”
6046,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"And so she sings her fill,"
6047,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Singing most joyfully,"
6048,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Till the spindle drops from her hand,"
6049,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,And the whizzing wheel stands still.
6050,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"She steals to the window, and looks at the sand,"
6051,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,And over the sand at the sea;
6052,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,And her eyes are set in a stare;
6053,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"And anon there breaks a sigh,"
6054,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"And anon there drops a tear,"
6055,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"From a sorrow-clouded eye,"
6056,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"And a heart sorrow-laden,"
6057,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"A long, long sigh,"
6058,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"For the cold strange eyes of a little mermaiden,"
6059,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,And the gleam of her golden hair.
6060,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,
6061,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Come away, away, children;"

6063,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,The hoarse wind blows colder;
6064,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,Lights shine in the town.
6065,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,She will start from her slumber
6066,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,When gusts shake the door:
6067,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"She will hear the winds howling,"
6068,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,Will hear the waves roar.
6069,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"We shall see, while above us"
6070,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"The waves roar and whirl,"
6071,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"A ceiling of amber,"
6072,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,A pavement of pearl.
6073,_THE FORSAKEN MERMAN._,"Singing, “Here came a mortal,"

8068,CALLICLES.,"In Agrigentum and Olympia,"
8069,CALLICLES.,"When his star reigned, before his banishment,"
8070,CALLICLES.,Is potent still on me in his decline.
8071,CALLICLES.,"But, O Pausanias, he is changed of late:"
8072,CALLICLES.,There is a settled trouble in his air
8073,CALLICLES.,Admits no momentary brightening now;
8074,CALLICLES.,"And when he comes among his friends at feasts,"
8075,CALLICLES.,’Tis as an orphan among prosperous boys.
8076,CALLICLES.,"Thou know’st of old he loved this harp of mine,"

8078,CALLICLES.,"He is now always moody, and I fear him;"

8086,PAUSANIAS.,Thou hast indeed a rare touch on thy harp;
8087,PAUSANIAS.,"He loves that in thee, too; there was a time"
8088,PAUSANIAS.,"(But that is past), he would have paid thy strain"
8089,PAUSANIAS.,With music to have drawn the stars from heaven.
8090,PAUSANIAS.,He has his harp and laurel with him still;
8091,PAUSANIAS.,"But he has laid the use of music by,"
8092,PAUSANIAS.,And all which might relax his settled gloom.
8093,PAUSANIAS.,"Yet thou may’st try thy playing, if thou wilt,"
8094,PAUSANIAS.,"But thou must keep unseen: follow us on,"
8095,PAUSANIAS.,"But at a distance! in these solitudes,"
8096,PAUSANIAS.,"In this clear mountain air, a voice will rise,"
8097,PAUSANIAS.,"Though from afar, distinctly; it may soothe him."
8098,PAUSANIAS.,"Play when we halt; and when the evening comes,"
8099,PAUSANIAS.,And I must leave him (for his pleasure is
8100,PAUSANIAS.,To be left musing these soft nights alone
8101,PAUSANIAS.,"In the high unfrequented mountain spots),"
8102,PAUSANIAS.,"Then watch him, for he ranges swift and far,"
8103,PAUSANIAS.,"Sometimes to Etna’s top, and to the cone;"
8104,PAUSANIAS.,"But hide thee in the rocks a great way down,"
8105,PAUSANIAS.,"And try thy noblest strains, my Callicles,"
8106,PAUSANIAS.,With the sweet night to help thy harmony!

8133,PAUSANIAS.,"This he could do of old; but now, since all"
8134,PAUSANIAS.,"Clouds and grows daily worse in Sicily,"
8135,PAUSANIAS.,"Since broils tear us in twain, since this new swarm"
8136,PAUSANIAS.,Of sophists has got empire in our schools
8137,PAUSANIAS.,"Where he was paramount, since he is banished,"

8140,PAUSANIAS.,"I asked him of Pantheia yesterday,"

8142,PAUSANIAS.,"And he made answer, I should come at night"
8143,PAUSANIAS.,"On Etna here, and be alone with him,"
8144,PAUSANIAS.,"And he would tell me, as his old, tried friend,"

8151,CALLICLES.,"Simple Pausanias, ’twas no miracle!"

8153,CALLICLES.,Was subject to these trances from a girl.
8154,CALLICLES.,"Empedocles would say so, did he deign;"
8155,CALLICLES.,"But he still lets the people, whom he scorns,"
8156,CALLICLES.,"Gape and cry _wizard_ at him, if they list."
8157,CALLICLES.,"But thou, thou art no company for him:"
8158,CALLICLES.,"Thou art as cross, as soured as himself."
8159,CALLICLES.,"Thou hast some wrong from thine own citizens,"
8160,CALLICLES.,"And then thy friend is banished; and on that,"
8161,CALLICLES.,"Straightway thou fallest to arraign the times,"
8162,CALLICLES.,As if the sky was impious not to fall.
8163,CALLICLES.,The sophists are no enemies of his;
8164,CALLICLES.,"I hear, Gorgias, their chief, speaks nobly of him,"

8167,CALLICLES.,"’Tis not the times, ’tis not the sophists, vex him:"
8168,CALLICLES.,"There is some root of suffering in himself,"
8169,CALLICLES.,"Some secret and unfollowed vein of woe,"
8170,CALLICLES.,Which makes the time look black and sad to him.
8171,CALLICLES.,"Pester him not, in this his sombre mood,"
8172,CALLICLES.,"With questionings about an idle tale,"
8173,CALLICLES.,"But lead him through the lovely mountain paths,"
8174,CALLICLES.,"And keep his mind from preying on itself,"

8236,PAUSANIAS.,"But I will also say, that when the gods"
8237,PAUSANIAS.,"Visit us as they do with sign and plague,"
8238,PAUSANIAS.,To know those spells of thine which stay their hand
8239,PAUSANIAS.,Were to live free from terror.
8240,PAUSANIAS.,
8241,EMPEDOCLES.,EMPEDOCLES.
8242,EMPEDOCLES.,
8243,EMPEDOCLES.,Spells? Mistrust them!
8244,EMPEDOCLES.,Mind is the spell which governs earth and heaven;
8245,EMPEDOCLES.,"Man has a mind with which to plan his safety,--"
8246,EMPEDOCLES.,"Know that, and help thyself!"

8248,PAUSANIAS.,PAUSANIAS.

8250,PAUSANIAS.,But thine own words?
8251,PAUSANIAS.,“The wit and counsel of man was never clear;
8252,PAUSANIAS.,Troubles confound the little wit he has.”
8253,PAUSANIAS.,"Mind is a light which the gods mock us with,"

8272,EMPEDOCLES.,"Of all the woody, high, well-watered dells"
8273,EMPEDOCLES.,On Etna; and the beam
8274,EMPEDOCLES.,Of noon is broken there by chestnut-boughs
8275,EMPEDOCLES.,Down its steep verdant sides; the air
8276,EMPEDOCLES.,"Is freshened by the leaping stream, which throws"

8285,EMPEDOCLES.,"Slope behind slope, up to the peak, lies bare,--"

8292,EMPEDOCLES.,The Centaur taught him to explore
8293,EMPEDOCLES.,"The mountains; where the glens are dry,"
8294,EMPEDOCLES.,"And the tired Centaurs come to rest,"
8295,EMPEDOCLES.,"And where the soaking springs abound,"
8296,EMPEDOCLES.,"And the straight ashes grow for spears,"
8297,EMPEDOCLES.,"And where the hill-goats come to feed,"
8298,EMPEDOCLES.,And the sea-eagles build their nest.
8299,EMPEDOCLES.,"He showed him Phthia far away,"
8300,EMPEDOCLES.,"And said, “O boy, I taught this lore"

8324,EMPEDOCLES.,
8325,EMPEDOCLES.,The gods laugh in their sleeve

8349,EMPEDOCLES.,Ask not what days and nights
8350,EMPEDOCLES.,"In trance Pantheia lay,"

8352,EMPEDOCLES.,May’st see without dismay;
8353,EMPEDOCLES.,"Ask what most helps when known, thou son of Anchitus!"
8354,EMPEDOCLES.,
8355,EMPEDOCLES.,"What! hate, and awe, and shame"

8374,EMPEDOCLES.,"Well, then, the wiser wight"
8375,EMPEDOCLES.,"In his own bosom delves,"

8395,EMPEDOCLES.,
8396,EMPEDOCLES.,What makes thee struggle and rave?
8397,EMPEDOCLES.,Why are men ill at ease?
8398,EMPEDOCLES.,’Tis that the lot they have
8399,EMPEDOCLES.,Fails their own will to please;
8400,EMPEDOCLES.,"For man would make no murmuring, were his will obeyed."
8401,EMPEDOCLES.,
8402,EMPEDOCLES.,"And why is it, that still"
8403,EMPEDOCLES.,Man with his lot thus fights?
8404,EMPEDOCLES.,’Tis that he makes this _will_
8405,EMPEDOCLES.,"The measure of his _rights_,"
8406,EMPEDOCLES.,And believes nature outraged if his will’s gainsaid.
8407,EMPEDOCLES.,
8408,EMPEDOCLES.,"Couldst thou, Pausanias, learn"

8412,EMPEDOCLES.,"No title from the gods to welfare and repose,--"
8413,EMPEDOCLES.,
8414,EMPEDOCLES.,Then thou wouldst look less mazed
8415,EMPEDOCLES.,"Whene’er of bliss debarred,"
8416,EMPEDOCLES.,Nor think the gods were crazed
8417,EMPEDOCLES.,When thy own lot went hard.
8418,EMPEDOCLES.,"But we are all the same,--the fools of our own woes!"
8419,EMPEDOCLES.,
8420,EMPEDOCLES.,"For, from the first faint morn"
8421,EMPEDOCLES.,"Of life, the thirst for bliss"
8422,EMPEDOCLES.,Deep in man’s heart is born;
8423,EMPEDOCLES.,"And, sceptic as he is,"
8424,EMPEDOCLES.,He fails not to judge clear if this be quenched or no.
8425,EMPEDOCLES.,
8426,EMPEDOCLES.,Nor is that thirst to blame.
8427,EMPEDOCLES.,Man errs not that he deems
8428,EMPEDOCLES.,His welfare his true aim:
8429,EMPEDOCLES.,He errs because he dreams
8430,EMPEDOCLES.,The world does but exist that welfare to bestow.
8431,EMPEDOCLES.,
8432,EMPEDOCLES.,We mortals are no kings
8433,EMPEDOCLES.,For each of whom to sway
8434,EMPEDOCLES.,"A new-made world upsprings,"
8435,EMPEDOCLES.,Meant merely for his play:
8436,EMPEDOCLES.,"No, we are strangers here; the world is from of old."
8437,EMPEDOCLES.,
8438,EMPEDOCLES.,"In vain our pent wills fret,"
8439,EMPEDOCLES.,And would the world subdue.
8440,EMPEDOCLES.,Limits we did not set
8441,EMPEDOCLES.,Condition all we do;
8442,EMPEDOCLES.,"Born into life we are, and life must be our mould."
8443,EMPEDOCLES.,
8444,EMPEDOCLES.,Born into life! man grows
8445,EMPEDOCLES.,"Forth from his parents’ stem,"
8446,EMPEDOCLES.,"And blends their bloods, as those"
8447,EMPEDOCLES.,Of theirs are blent in them;
8448,EMPEDOCLES.,So each new man strikes root into a far fore-time.
8449,EMPEDOCLES.,
8450,EMPEDOCLES.,Born into life! we bring
8451,EMPEDOCLES.,"A bias with us here,"
8452,EMPEDOCLES.,"And, when here, each new thing"
8453,EMPEDOCLES.,Affects us we come near;
8454,EMPEDOCLES.,"To tunes we did not call, our being must keep chime."
8455,EMPEDOCLES.,
8456,EMPEDOCLES.,"Born into life! in vain,"
8457,EMPEDOCLES.,"Opinions, those or these,"
8458,EMPEDOCLES.,"Unaltered to retain,"
8459,EMPEDOCLES.,The obstinate mind decrees:
8460,EMPEDOCLES.,"Experience, like a sea, soaks all-effacing in."
8461,EMPEDOCLES.,
8462,EMPEDOCLES.,Born into life! who lists
8463,EMPEDOCLES.,"May what is false hold dear,"
8464,EMPEDOCLES.,And for himself make mists
8465,EMPEDOCLES.,Through which to see less clear:
8466,EMPEDOCLES.,"The world is what it is, for all our dust and din."
8467,EMPEDOCLES.,
8468,EMPEDOCLES.,"Born into life! ’tis we,"
8469,EMPEDOCLES.,"And not the world, are new;"
8470,EMPEDOCLES.,"Our cry for bliss, our plea,"
8471,EMPEDOCLES.,Others have urged it too:
8472,EMPEDOCLES.,"Our wants have all been felt, our errors made before."
8473,EMPEDOCLES.,
8474,EMPEDOCLES.,No eye could be too sound
8475,EMPEDOCLES.,"To observe a world so vast,"
8476,EMPEDOCLES.,No patience too profound
8477,EMPEDOCLES.,To sort what’s here amassed;
8478,EMPEDOCLES.,"How man may here best live, no care too great to explore."
8479,EMPEDOCLES.,
8480,EMPEDOCLES.,"But we,--as some rude guest"
8481,EMPEDOCLES.,"Would change, where’er he roam,"
8482,EMPEDOCLES.,The manners there professed
8483,EMPEDOCLES.,"To those he brings from home,--"
8484,EMPEDOCLES.,"We mark not the world’s course, but would have _it_ take _ours_."
8485,EMPEDOCLES.,
8486,EMPEDOCLES.,The world’s course proves the terms
8487,EMPEDOCLES.,On which man wins content;
8488,EMPEDOCLES.,Reason the proof confirms:
8489,EMPEDOCLES.,"We spurn it, and invent"
8490,EMPEDOCLES.,"A false course for the world, and for ourselves false powers."
8491,EMPEDOCLES.,
8492,EMPEDOCLES.,"Riches we wish to get,"
8493,EMPEDOCLES.,Yet remain spendthrifts still;
8494,EMPEDOCLES.,"We would have health, and yet"
8495,EMPEDOCLES.,Still use our bodies ill;
8496,EMPEDOCLES.,"Bafflers of our own prayers, from youth to life’s last scenes."
8497,EMPEDOCLES.,
8498,EMPEDOCLES.,"We would have inward peace,"
8499,EMPEDOCLES.,Yet will not look within;
8500,EMPEDOCLES.,"We would have misery cease,"
8501,EMPEDOCLES.,Yet will not cease from sin;
8502,EMPEDOCLES.,"We want all pleasant ends, but will use no harsh means;"
8503,EMPEDOCLES.,
8504,EMPEDOCLES.,We do not what we ought;
8505,EMPEDOCLES.,"What we ought not, we do;"
8506,EMPEDOCLES.,And lean upon the thought
8507,EMPEDOCLES.,That chance will bring us through:
8508,EMPEDOCLES.,"But our own acts, for good or ill, are mightier powers."
8509,EMPEDOCLES.,
8510,EMPEDOCLES.,Yet even when man forsakes
8511,EMPEDOCLES.,"All sin,--is just, is pure,"
8512,EMPEDOCLES.,Abandons all which makes
8513,EMPEDOCLES.,"His welfare insecure,--"
8514,EMPEDOCLES.,"Other existences there are, that clash with ours."
8515,EMPEDOCLES.,
8516,EMPEDOCLES.,"Like us, the lightning-fires"
8517,EMPEDOCLES.,Love to have scope and play;
8518,EMPEDOCLES.,"The stream, like us, desires"
8519,EMPEDOCLES.,An unimpeded way;
8520,EMPEDOCLES.,"Like us, the Libyan wind delights to roam at large."
8521,EMPEDOCLES.,
8522,EMPEDOCLES.,Streams will not curb their pride
8523,EMPEDOCLES.,"The just man not to entomb,"
8524,EMPEDOCLES.,Nor lightnings go aside
8525,EMPEDOCLES.,To give his virtues room;
8526,EMPEDOCLES.,Nor is that wind less rough which blows a good man’s barge.
8527,EMPEDOCLES.,
8528,EMPEDOCLES.,"Nature, with equal mind,"
8529,EMPEDOCLES.,Sees all her sons at play;
8530,EMPEDOCLES.,"Sees man control the wind,"
8531,EMPEDOCLES.,The wind sweep man away;
8532,EMPEDOCLES.,Allows the proudly riding and the foundering bark.
8533,EMPEDOCLES.,
8534,EMPEDOCLES.,"And, lastly, though of ours"
8535,EMPEDOCLES.,"No weakness spoil our lot,"
8536,EMPEDOCLES.,Though the non-human powers
8537,EMPEDOCLES.,"Of nature harm us not,"
8538,EMPEDOCLES.,The ill deeds of other men make often _our_ life dark.
8539,EMPEDOCLES.,
8540,EMPEDOCLES.,What were the wise man’s plan?
8541,EMPEDOCLES.,"Through this sharp, toil-set life,"
8542,EMPEDOCLES.,"To fight as best he can,"
8543,EMPEDOCLES.,And win what’s won by strife.
8544,EMPEDOCLES.,But we an easier way to cheat our pains have found.
8545,EMPEDOCLES.,
8546,EMPEDOCLES.,"Scratched by a fall, with moans"
8547,EMPEDOCLES.,As children of weak age
8548,EMPEDOCLES.,Lend life to the dumb stones
8549,EMPEDOCLES.,"Whereon to vent their rage,"
8550,EMPEDOCLES.,"And bend their little fists, and rate the senseless ground;"
8551,EMPEDOCLES.,"So, loath to suffer mute,"
8552,EMPEDOCLES.,"We, peopling the void air,"
8553,EMPEDOCLES.,Make gods to whom to impute
8554,EMPEDOCLES.,The ills we ought to bear;
8555,EMPEDOCLES.,"With God and fate to rail at, suffering easily."
8556,EMPEDOCLES.,
8557,EMPEDOCLES.,"Yet grant,--as sense long missed"
8558,EMPEDOCLES.,"Things that are now perceived,"
8559,EMPEDOCLES.,And much may still exist
8560,EMPEDOCLES.,"Which is not yet believed,--"
8561,EMPEDOCLES.,Grant that the world were full of gods we cannot see;
8562,EMPEDOCLES.,
8563,EMPEDOCLES.,All things the world which fill
8564,EMPEDOCLES.,"Of but one stuff are spun,"
8565,EMPEDOCLES.,"That we who rail are still,"
8566,EMPEDOCLES.,"With what we rail at, one;"
8567,EMPEDOCLES.,One with the o’er-labored Power that through the breadth and length
8568,EMPEDOCLES.,
8569,EMPEDOCLES.,"Of earth, and air, and sea,"
8570,EMPEDOCLES.,"In men, and plants, and stones,"
8571,EMPEDOCLES.,"Hath toil perpetually,"
8572,EMPEDOCLES.,"And travails, pants, and moans;"
8573,EMPEDOCLES.,"Fain would do all things well, but sometimes fails in strength."
8574,EMPEDOCLES.,
8575,EMPEDOCLES.,And patiently exact
8576,EMPEDOCLES.,This universal God
8577,EMPEDOCLES.,Alike to any act
8578,EMPEDOCLES.,"Proceeds at any nod,"
8579,EMPEDOCLES.,And quietly declaims the cursings of himself.
8580,EMPEDOCLES.,
8581,EMPEDOCLES.,"This is not what man hates,"
8582,EMPEDOCLES.,Yet he can curse but this.
8583,EMPEDOCLES.,Harsh gods and hostile fates
8584,EMPEDOCLES.,"Are dreams! this only _is_,--"
8585,EMPEDOCLES.,"Is everywhere; sustains the wise, the foolish elf."
8586,EMPEDOCLES.,
8587,EMPEDOCLES.,"Nor only, in the intent"
8588,EMPEDOCLES.,"To attach blame elsewhere,"
8589,EMPEDOCLES.,Do we at will invent
8590,EMPEDOCLES.,Stern powers who make their care
8591,EMPEDOCLES.,"To imbitter human life, malignant deities;"
8592,EMPEDOCLES.,
8593,EMPEDOCLES.,"But, next, we would reverse"
8594,EMPEDOCLES.,"The scheme ourselves have spun,"
8595,EMPEDOCLES.,And what we made to curse
8596,EMPEDOCLES.,"We now would lean upon,"
8597,EMPEDOCLES.,And feign kind gods who perfect what man vainly tries.
8598,EMPEDOCLES.,
8599,EMPEDOCLES.,"Look, the world tempts our eye,"
8600,EMPEDOCLES.,And we would know it all!
8601,EMPEDOCLES.,"We map the starry sky,"
8602,EMPEDOCLES.,"We mine this earthen ball,"
8603,EMPEDOCLES.,"We measure the sea-tides, we number the sea-sands;"
8604,EMPEDOCLES.,
8605,EMPEDOCLES.,We scrutinize the dates
8606,EMPEDOCLES.,"Of long-past human things,"
8607,EMPEDOCLES.,"The bounds of effaced states,"
8608,EMPEDOCLES.,The lines of deceased kings;
8609,EMPEDOCLES.,"We search out dead men’s words, and works of dead men’s hands;"
8610,EMPEDOCLES.,
8611,EMPEDOCLES.,"We shut our eyes, and muse"
8612,EMPEDOCLES.,"How our own minds are made,"
8613,EMPEDOCLES.,"What springs of thought they use,"
8614,EMPEDOCLES.,"How rightened, how betrayed,--"
8615,EMPEDOCLES.,And spend our wit to name what most employ unnamed.
8616,EMPEDOCLES.,
8617,EMPEDOCLES.,"But still, as we proceed,"
8618,EMPEDOCLES.,The mass swells more and more
8619,EMPEDOCLES.,"Of volumes yet to read,"
8620,EMPEDOCLES.,Of secrets yet to explore.
8621,EMPEDOCLES.,"Our hair grows gray, our eyes are dimmed, our heat is tamed;"
8622,EMPEDOCLES.,"We rest our faculties,"
8623,EMPEDOCLES.,And thus address the gods:
8624,EMPEDOCLES.,"“True science if there is,"
8625,EMPEDOCLES.,It stays in your abodes!
8626,EMPEDOCLES.,Man’s measures cannot mete the immeasurable all.
8627,EMPEDOCLES.,
8628,EMPEDOCLES.,“You only can take in
8629,EMPEDOCLES.,The world’s immense design;
8630,EMPEDOCLES.,"Our desperate search was sin,"
8631,EMPEDOCLES.,"Which henceforth we resign,"
8632,EMPEDOCLES.,Sure only that your mind sees all things which befall.”
8633,EMPEDOCLES.,
8634,EMPEDOCLES.,Fools! That in man’s brief term
8635,EMPEDOCLES.,"He cannot all things view,"
8636,EMPEDOCLES.,Affords no ground to affirm
8637,EMPEDOCLES.,That there are gods who do;
8638,EMPEDOCLES.,Nor does being weary prove that he has where to rest.
8639,EMPEDOCLES.,
8640,EMPEDOCLES.,Again: Our youthful blood
8641,EMPEDOCLES.,Claims rapture as its right;
8642,EMPEDOCLES.,"The world, a rolling flood"
8643,EMPEDOCLES.,"Of newness and delight,"
8644,EMPEDOCLES.,Draws in the enamoured gazer to its shining breast;
8645,EMPEDOCLES.,
8646,EMPEDOCLES.,"Pleasure, to our hot grasp,"
8647,EMPEDOCLES.,Gives flowers after flowers;
8648,EMPEDOCLES.,With passionate warmth we clasp
8649,EMPEDOCLES.,Hand after hand in ours;
8650,EMPEDOCLES.,Now do we soon perceive how fast our youth is spent.
8651,EMPEDOCLES.,
8652,EMPEDOCLES.,At once our eyes grow clear!
8653,EMPEDOCLES.,"We see, in blank dismay,"
8654,EMPEDOCLES.,"Year posting after year,"
8655,EMPEDOCLES.,Sense after sense decay;
8656,EMPEDOCLES.,Our shivering heart is mined by secret discontent.
8657,EMPEDOCLES.,
8658,EMPEDOCLES.,"Yet still, in spite of truth,"
8659,EMPEDOCLES.,"In spite of hopes entombed,"
8660,EMPEDOCLES.,That longing of our youth
8661,EMPEDOCLES.,"Burns ever unconsumed,"
8662,EMPEDOCLES.,Still hungrier for delight as delights grow more rare.

8664,EMPEDOCLES.,"We pause; we hush our heart,"

8666,EMPEDOCLES.,“The world hath failed to impart
8667,EMPEDOCLES.,"The joy our youth forebodes,"
8668,EMPEDOCLES.,Failed to fill up the void which in our breasts we bear.
8669,EMPEDOCLES.,
8670,EMPEDOCLES.,"“Changeful till now, we still"
8671,EMPEDOCLES.,Looked on to something new;
8672,EMPEDOCLES.,"Let us, with changeless will,"
8673,EMPEDOCLES.,"Henceforth look on to you,"
8674,EMPEDOCLES.,To find with you the joy we in vain here require!”
8675,EMPEDOCLES.,
8676,EMPEDOCLES.,Fools! That so often here
8677,EMPEDOCLES.,"Happiness mocked our prayer,"
8678,EMPEDOCLES.,"I think, might make us fear"
8679,EMPEDOCLES.,A like event elsewhere;
8680,EMPEDOCLES.,"Make us not fly to dreams, but moderate desire."
8681,EMPEDOCLES.,
8682,EMPEDOCLES.,"And yet, for those who know"
8683,EMPEDOCLES.,"Themselves, who wisely take"
8684,EMPEDOCLES.,"Their way through life, and bow"
8685,EMPEDOCLES.,"To what they cannot break,"
8686,EMPEDOCLES.,Why should I say that life need yield but _moderate_ bliss?
8687,EMPEDOCLES.,
8688,EMPEDOCLES.,"Shall we, with temper spoiled,"
8689,EMPEDOCLES.,"Health sapped by living ill,"
8690,EMPEDOCLES.,And judgment all embroiled
8691,EMPEDOCLES.,"By sadness and self-will,--"
8692,EMPEDOCLES.,Shall we judge what for man is not true bliss or is?
8693,EMPEDOCLES.,
8694,EMPEDOCLES.,Is it so small a thing
8695,EMPEDOCLES.,"To have enjoyed the sun,"
8696,EMPEDOCLES.,"To have lived light in the spring,"
8697,EMPEDOCLES.,"To have loved, to have thought, to have done"
8698,EMPEDOCLES.,"To have advanced true friends, and beat down baffling foes,--"
8699,EMPEDOCLES.,
8700,EMPEDOCLES.,That we must feign a bliss
8701,EMPEDOCLES.,"Of doubtful future date,"
8702,EMPEDOCLES.,"And, while we dream on this,"
8703,EMPEDOCLES.,"Lose all our present state,"
8704,EMPEDOCLES.,And relegate to worlds yet distant our repose?
8705,EMPEDOCLES.,
8706,EMPEDOCLES.,"Not much, I know, you prize"
8707,EMPEDOCLES.,"What pleasures may be had,"
8708,EMPEDOCLES.,Who look on life with eyes
8709,EMPEDOCLES.,"Estranged, like mine, and sad;"
8710,EMPEDOCLES.,And yet the village-churl feels the truth more than you;
8711,EMPEDOCLES.,
8712,EMPEDOCLES.,Who’s loath to leave this life
8713,EMPEDOCLES.,"Which to him little yields,--"
8714,EMPEDOCLES.,"His hard-tasked sunburnt wife,"
8715,EMPEDOCLES.,"His often-labored fields,"
8716,EMPEDOCLES.,"The boors with whom he talked, the country-spots he knew."
8717,EMPEDOCLES.,
8718,EMPEDOCLES.,"But thou, because thou hear’st"
8719,EMPEDOCLES.,"Men scoff at heaven and fate,"
8720,EMPEDOCLES.,Because the gods thou fear’st
8721,EMPEDOCLES.,"Fail to make blest thy state,"
8722,EMPEDOCLES.,"Tremblest, and wilt not dare to trust the joys there are!"
8723,EMPEDOCLES.,
8724,EMPEDOCLES.,I say: Fear not! Life still
8725,EMPEDOCLES.,Leaves human effort scope.
8726,EMPEDOCLES.,"But, since life teems with ill,"
8727,EMPEDOCLES.,Nurse no extravagant hope;
8728,EMPEDOCLES.,"Because thou must not dream, thou need’st not then despair!"
8729,EMPEDOCLES.,
8730,EMPEDOCLES.,_A long pause._ _At the end of it the notes of a harp below are

8733,EMPEDOCLES.,"Far, far from here,"
8734,EMPEDOCLES.,The Adriatic breaks in a warm bay
8735,EMPEDOCLES.,Among the green Illyrian hills; and there
8736,EMPEDOCLES.,"The sunshine in the happy glens is fair,"
8737,EMPEDOCLES.,"And by the sea, and in the brakes."
8738,EMPEDOCLES.,"The grass is cool, the sea-side air"

8741,EMPEDOCLES.,"And there, they say, two bright and aged snakes,"
8742,EMPEDOCLES.,"Who once were Cadmus and Harmonia,"
8743,EMPEDOCLES.,"Bask in the glens or on the warm seashore,"
8744,EMPEDOCLES.,"In breathless quiet, after all their ills;"

8754,EMPEDOCLES.,"Curse upon curse, pang upon pang,"
8755,EMPEDOCLES.,"For years, they sitting helpless in their home,"
8756,EMPEDOCLES.,A gray old man and woman; yet of old
8757,EMPEDOCLES.,"The gods had to their marriage come,"
8758,EMPEDOCLES.,And at the banquet all the Muses sang.
8759,EMPEDOCLES.,
8760,EMPEDOCLES.,Therefore they did not end their days
8761,EMPEDOCLES.,"In sight of blood; but were rapt, far away,"
8762,EMPEDOCLES.,"To where the west-wind plays,"
8763,EMPEDOCLES.,And murmurs of the Adriatic come
8764,EMPEDOCLES.,To those untrodden mountain lawns; and there
8765,EMPEDOCLES.,"Placed safely in changed forms, the pair"
8766,EMPEDOCLES.,"Wholly forget their first sad life, and home,"
8767,EMPEDOCLES.,"And all that Theban woe, and stray"

8781,EMPEDOCLES.,He ever loved the Theban story well!
8782,EMPEDOCLES.,"But the day wears. Go now, Pausanias,"
8783,EMPEDOCLES.,For I must be alone. Leave me one mule;
8784,EMPEDOCLES.,Take down with thee the rest to Catana.
8785,EMPEDOCLES.,"And for young Callicles, thank him from me;"
8786,EMPEDOCLES.,"Tell him, I never failed to love his lyre;"

8812,EMPEDOCLES.,How his brow lightened as the music rose!
8813,EMPEDOCLES.,"Callicles must wait here, and play to him;"

8849,EMPEDOCLES.,And being lonely thou art miserable;
8850,EMPEDOCLES.,"For something has impaired thy spirit’s strength,"

8913,EMPEDOCLES.,"Droops all his sheeny, brown, deep-feathered neck,"
8914,EMPEDOCLES.,Nestling nearer to Jove’s feet;
8915,EMPEDOCLES.,While o’er his sovran eye
8916,EMPEDOCLES.,The curtains of the blue films slowly meet.
8917,EMPEDOCLES.,And the white Olympus-peaks
8918,EMPEDOCLES.,"Rosily brighten, and the soothed gods smile"

8936,EMPEDOCLES.,"These rumblings are not Typho’s groans, I know!"

8944,EMPEDOCLES.,That self-helping son of earth!
8945,EMPEDOCLES.,"What anguish of greatness,"
8946,EMPEDOCLES.,"Railed and hunted from the world,"

8970,EMPEDOCLES.,
8971,EMPEDOCLES.,Oh that fate had let me see
8972,EMPEDOCLES.,"That triumph of the sweet persuasive lyre,"
8973,EMPEDOCLES.,"That famous, final victory"
8974,EMPEDOCLES.,When jealous Pan with Marsyas did conspire!
8975,EMPEDOCLES.,
8976,EMPEDOCLES.,"When, from far Parnassus’ side,"
8977,EMPEDOCLES.,"Young Apollo, all the pride"
8978,EMPEDOCLES.,"Of the Phrygian flutes to tame,"
8979,EMPEDOCLES.,To the Phrygian highlands came;
8980,EMPEDOCLES.,Where the long green reed-beds sway
8981,EMPEDOCLES.,In the rippled waters gray
8982,EMPEDOCLES.,Of that solitary lake
8983,EMPEDOCLES.,Where Mæander’s springs are born;
8984,EMPEDOCLES.,Where the ridged pine-wooded roots
8985,EMPEDOCLES.,"Of Messogis westward break,"
8986,EMPEDOCLES.,"Mounting westward, high and higher."
8987,EMPEDOCLES.,There was held the famous strife;
8988,EMPEDOCLES.,"There the Phrygian brought his flutes,"
8989,EMPEDOCLES.,And Apollo brought his lyre;
8990,EMPEDOCLES.,"And, when now the westering sun"
8991,EMPEDOCLES.,"Touched the hills, the strife was done,"
8992,EMPEDOCLES.,"And the attentive muses said,--"
8993,EMPEDOCLES.,"“Marsyas, thou art vanquishèd!”"
8994,EMPEDOCLES.,Then Apollo’s minister
8995,EMPEDOCLES.,Hanged upon a branching fir
8996,EMPEDOCLES.,"Marsyas, that unhappy Faun,"
8997,EMPEDOCLES.,And began to whet his knife.
8998,EMPEDOCLES.,"But the Mænads, who were there,"
8999,EMPEDOCLES.,"Left their friend, and with robes flowing"
9000,EMPEDOCLES.,"In the wind, and loose dark hair"
9001,EMPEDOCLES.,"O’er their polished bosoms blowing,"
9002,EMPEDOCLES.,Each her ribboned tambourine
9003,EMPEDOCLES.,"Flinging on the mountain-sod,"
9004,EMPEDOCLES.,With a lovely frightened mien
9005,EMPEDOCLES.,Came about the youthful god.
9006,EMPEDOCLES.,But he turned his beauteous face
9007,EMPEDOCLES.,"Haughtily another way,"
9008,EMPEDOCLES.,From the grassy sun-warmed place
9009,EMPEDOCLES.,"Where in proud repose he lay,"
9010,EMPEDOCLES.,"With one arm over his head,"
9011,EMPEDOCLES.,Watching how the whetting sped.
9012,EMPEDOCLES.,
9013,EMPEDOCLES.,"But aloof, on the lake-strand,"
9014,EMPEDOCLES.,"Did the young Olympus stand,"
9015,EMPEDOCLES.,Weeping at his master’s end;
9016,EMPEDOCLES.,For the Faun had been his friend.
9017,EMPEDOCLES.,"For he taught him how to sing,"
9018,EMPEDOCLES.,And he taught him flute-playing.
9019,EMPEDOCLES.,Many a morning had they gone
9020,EMPEDOCLES.,"To the glimmering mountain lakes,"
9021,EMPEDOCLES.,And had torn up by the roots
9022,EMPEDOCLES.,The tall crested water-reeds
9023,EMPEDOCLES.,"With long plumes and soft brown seeds,"
9024,EMPEDOCLES.,"And had carved them into flutes,"
9025,EMPEDOCLES.,Sitting on a tabled stone
9026,EMPEDOCLES.,Where the shoreward ripple breaks.
9027,EMPEDOCLES.,And he taught him how to please
9028,EMPEDOCLES.,"The red-snooded Phrygian girls,"
9029,EMPEDOCLES.,Whom the summer evening sees
9030,EMPEDOCLES.,Flashing in the dance’s whirls
9031,EMPEDOCLES.,Underneath the starlit trees
9032,EMPEDOCLES.,In the mountain villages.
9033,EMPEDOCLES.,"Therefore now Olympus stands,"
9034,EMPEDOCLES.,At his master’s piteous cries
9035,EMPEDOCLES.,Pressing fast with both his hands
9036,EMPEDOCLES.,"His white garment to his eyes,"
9037,EMPEDOCLES.,Not to see Apollo’s scorn.--
9038,EMPEDOCLES.,"Ah, poor Faun, poor Faun! ah, poor Faun!"
9039,EMPEDOCLES.,
9040,EMPEDOCLES.,EMPEDOCLES.
9041,EMPEDOCLES.,
9042,EMPEDOCLES.,"And lie thou there,"
9043,EMPEDOCLES.,My laurel bough!
9044,EMPEDOCLES.,"Scornful Apollo’s ensign, lie thou there!"
9045,EMPEDOCLES.,"Though thou hast been my shade in the world’s heat,"
9046,EMPEDOCLES.,"Though I have loved thee, lived in honoring thee,"
9047,EMPEDOCLES.,"Yet lie thou there,"
9048,EMPEDOCLES.,My laurel bough!
9049,EMPEDOCLES.,
9050,EMPEDOCLES.,I am weary of thee.
9051,EMPEDOCLES.,I am weary of the solitude
9052,EMPEDOCLES.,"Where he who bears thee must abide,--"
9053,EMPEDOCLES.,"Of the rocks of Parnassus,"
9054,EMPEDOCLES.,"Of the gorge of Delphi,"
9055,EMPEDOCLES.,"Of the moonlight peaks, and the caves."
9056,EMPEDOCLES.,"Thou guardest them, Apollo!"
9057,EMPEDOCLES.,"Over the grave of the slain Pytho,"
9058,EMPEDOCLES.,"Though young, intolerably severe!"
9059,EMPEDOCLES.,"Thou keepest aloof the profane,"
9060,EMPEDOCLES.,But the solitude oppresses thy votary.
9061,EMPEDOCLES.,"The jars of men reach him not in thy valley,"
9062,EMPEDOCLES.,But can life reach him?
9063,EMPEDOCLES.,Thou fencest him from the multitude:
9064,EMPEDOCLES.,Who will fence him from himself?
9065,EMPEDOCLES.,"He hears nothing but the cry of the torrents,"
9066,EMPEDOCLES.,And the beating of his own heart;
9067,EMPEDOCLES.,"The air is thin, the veins swell,"
9068,EMPEDOCLES.,The temples tighten and throb there--
9069,EMPEDOCLES.,Air! air!
9070,EMPEDOCLES.,
9071,EMPEDOCLES.,"Take thy bough, set me free from my solitude;"
9072,EMPEDOCLES.,I have been enough alone!
9073,EMPEDOCLES.,
9074,EMPEDOCLES.,"Where shall thy votary fly, then? back to men?"
9075,EMPEDOCLES.,"But they will gladly welcome him once more,"
9076,EMPEDOCLES.,"And help him to unbend his too tense thought,"
9077,EMPEDOCLES.,"And rid him of the presence of himself,"
9078,EMPEDOCLES.,"And keep their friendly chatter at his ear,"
9079,EMPEDOCLES.,"And haunt him, till the absence from himself,"
9080,EMPEDOCLES.,"That other torment, grow unbearable;"
9081,EMPEDOCLES.,"And he will fly to solitude again,"
9082,EMPEDOCLES.,"And he will find its air too keen for him,"

9095,EMPEDOCLES.,"Then we could still enjoy, then neither thought"

9097,EMPEDOCLES.,But we received the shock of mighty thoughts
9098,EMPEDOCLES.,On simple minds with a pure natural joy;
9099,EMPEDOCLES.,"And if the sacred load oppressed our brain,"
9100,EMPEDOCLES.,"We had the power to feel the pressure eased,"
9101,EMPEDOCLES.,"The brow unbound, the thoughts flow free again,"
9102,EMPEDOCLES.,In the delightful commerce of the world.
9103,EMPEDOCLES.,"We had not lost our balance then, nor grown"

9109,EMPEDOCLES.,"Seed-time and harvest,"
9110,EMPEDOCLES.,"The reapers in the corn,"
9111,EMPEDOCLES.,"The vinedresser in his vineyard,"

9117,EMPEDOCLES.,But he who has outlived his prosperous days;
9118,EMPEDOCLES.,But he whose youth fell on a different world
9119,EMPEDOCLES.,"From that on which his exiled age is thrown,--"
9120,EMPEDOCLES.,"Whose mind was fed on other food, was trained"

9126,EMPEDOCLES.,That the world win no mastery over him;
9127,EMPEDOCLES.,"Who has no friend, no fellow left, not one;"
9128,EMPEDOCLES.,Who has no minute’s breathing-space allowed
9129,EMPEDOCLES.,"To nurse his dwindling faculty of joy,--"

9977,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,Perfumes the evening air.
9978,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,Their children play on the lawns.

9980,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,"The children’s shouts, and at times,"
9981,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,"Faintly, the bark of a dog"
9982,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,From a distant farm in the hills.

9988,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,"Darkening fast; but a light,"

9993,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,"Through the silent, flowery land,"

10011,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,
10012,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,"And they remember,"
10013,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,"With piercing, untold anguish,"
10014,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,The proud boasting of their youth.
10015,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,And they feel how Nature was fair.
10016,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,"And the mists of delusion,"
10017,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,"And the scales of habit,"
10018,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,Fall away from their eyes;
10019,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,"And they see, for a moment,"
10020,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,Stretching out like the desert
10021,_THE YOUTH OF MAN._,"In its weary, unprofitable length,"

10267,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Those windows, which I gaze at, frown,"
10268,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Silent and white, unopening down,"
10269,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Repellent as the world; but see,"
10270,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,A break between the housetops shows
10271,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"The moon! and lost behind her, fading dim"
10272,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,Into the dewy dark obscurity
10273,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Down at the far horizon’s rim,"

10275,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,
10276,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,And to my mind the thought
10277,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,Is on a sudden brought
10278,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Of a past night, and a far different scene."
10279,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,Headlands stood out into the moonlit deep
10280,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,As clearly as at noon;
10281,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,The spring-tide’s brimming flow
10282,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,Heaved dazzlingly between;
10283,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Houses, with long white sweep,"
10284,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,Girdled the glistening bay;
10285,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Behind, through the soft air,"
10286,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,The blue haze-cradled mountains spread away.
10287,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,That night was far more fair--
10288,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"But the same restless pacings to and fro,"
10289,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"And the same vainly throbbing heart was there,"
10290,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"And the same bright, calm moon."
10291,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,
10292,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"And the calm moonlight seems to say,--"
10293,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"_Hast thou, then, still the old unquiet breast,_"
10294,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"_Which neither deadens into rest,_"
10295,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,_Nor ever feels the fiery glow_

10303,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,
10304,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"For most men in a brazen prison live,"
10305,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Where, in the sun’s hot eye,"

10307,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Their lives to some unmeaning task-work give,"
10308,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,Dreaming of naught beyond their prison-wall.
10309,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"And as, year after year,"
10310,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,Fresh products of their barren labor fall
10311,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"From their tired hands, and rest"
10312,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Never yet comes more near,"
10313,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,Gloom settles slowly down over their breast.

10315,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"The waves of mournful thought by which they are prest,"
10316,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Death in their prison reaches them,"
10317,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Unfreed, having seen nothing, still unblest."

10319,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"And the rest, a few,"
10320,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Escape their prison, and depart"
10321,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,On the wide ocean of life anew.
10322,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"There the freed prisoner, where’er his heart"

10330,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,And then the tempest strikes him; and between
10331,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,The lightning-bursts is seen
10332,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Only a driving wreck,"
10333,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,And the pale master on his spar-strewn deck
10334,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"With anguished face and flying hair,"
10335,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Grasping the rudder hard,"
10336,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Still bent to make some port, he knows not where,"
10337,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Still standing for some false, impossible shore."
10338,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,And sterner comes the roar
10339,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,Of sea and wind; and through the deepening gloom
10340,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Fainter and fainter wreck and helmsman loom,"
10341,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"And he too disappears, and comes no more."
10342,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,
10343,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Is there no life, but these alone?"

10348,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Ye heavens, whose pure dark regions have no sign"
10349,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Of languor, though so calm, and though so great"
10350,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,Are yet untroubled and unpassionate;
10351,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Who, though so noble, share in the world’s toil,"
10352,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"And, though so tasked, keep free from dust and soil!"
10353,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,I will not say that your mild deeps retain
10354,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"A tinge, it may be, of their silent pain"
10355,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"Who have longed deeply once, and longed in vain;"
10356,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,But I will rather say that you remain
10357,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"A world above man’s head, to let him see"
10358,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"How boundless might his soul’s horizons be,"
10359,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"How vast, yet of what clear transparency!"
10360,_A SUMMER NIGHT._,"How it were good to live there, and breathe free;"

10371,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"Behold, with tears mine eyes are wet!"
10372,_THE BURIED LIFE._,I feel a nameless sadness o’er me roll.
10373,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"Yes, yes, we know that we can jest,"

10382,_THE BURIED LIFE._,Alas! is even love too weak

10386,_THE BURIED LIFE._,
10387,_THE BURIED LIFE._,I knew the mass of men concealed
10388,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"Their thoughts, for fear that if revealed"

10390,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"With blank indifference, or with blame reproved;"

10398,_THE BURIED LIFE._,
10399,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"Ah! well for us, if even we,"
10400,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"Even for a moment, can get free"
10401,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"Our heart, and have our lips unchained;"

10409,_THE BURIED LIFE._,That it might keep from his capricious play
10410,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"His genuine self, and force him to obey"

10412,_THE BURIED LIFE._,Bade through the deep recesses of our breast
10413,_THE BURIED LIFE._,The unregarded river of our life
10414,_THE BURIED LIFE._,Pursue with indiscernible flow its way;
10415,_THE BURIED LIFE._,And that we should not see
10416,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"The buried stream, and seem to be"
10417,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"Eddying at large in blind uncertainty,"

10421,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"But often, in the din of strife,"
10422,_THE BURIED LIFE._,There rises an unspeakable desire
10423,_THE BURIED LIFE._,After the knowledge of our buried life;
10424,_THE BURIED LIFE._,A thirst to spend our fire and restless force
10425,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"In tracking out our true, original course;"
10426,_THE BURIED LIFE._,A longing to inquire

10430,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"And many a man in his own breast then delves,"
10431,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"But deep enough, alas! none ever mines."
10432,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"And we have been on many thousand lines,"
10433,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"And we have shown, on each, spirit and power;"
10434,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"But hardly have we, for one little hour,"
10435,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"Been on our own line, have we been ourselves,--"
10436,_THE BURIED LIFE._,Hardly had skill to utter one of all
10437,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"The nameless feelings that course through our breast,"
10438,_THE BURIED LIFE._,But they course on forever unexpressed.
10439,_THE BURIED LIFE._,And long we try in vain to speak and act
10440,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"Our hidden self, and what we say and do"
10441,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"Is eloquent, is well--but ’tis not true!"
10442,_THE BURIED LIFE._,And then we will no more be racked

10445,_THE BURIED LIFE._,Their stupefying power;
10446,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"Ah, yes, and they benumb us at our call!"
10447,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"Yet still, from time to time, vague and forlorn,"
10448,_THE BURIED LIFE._,From the soul’s subterranean depth upborne
10449,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"As from an infinitely distant land,"
10450,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"Come airs, and floating echoes, and convey"

10452,_THE BURIED LIFE._,
10453,_THE BURIED LIFE._,Only--but this is rare--
10454,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"When a beloved hand is laid in ours,"

10456,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"Of the interminable hours,"
10457,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"Our eyes can in another’s eyes read clear,"
10458,_THE BURIED LIFE._,When our world-deafened ear
10459,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"Is by the tones of a loved voice caressed,--"
10460,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast,"
10461,_THE BURIED LIFE._,And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again.
10462,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain,"
10463,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know."
10464,_THE BURIED LIFE._,
10465,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"A man becomes aware of his life’s flow,"
10466,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"And hears its winding murmur, and he sees"

10468,_THE BURIED LIFE._,
10469,_THE BURIED LIFE._,And there arrives a lull in the hot race

10472,_THE BURIED LIFE._,"An air of coolness plays upon his face,"

10729,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"But when the fields are still,"
10730,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And the tired men and dogs all gone to rest,"
10731,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And only the white sheep are sometimes seen

10737,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"His coat, his basket, and his earthen cruse,"

10740,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Here will I sit and wait,"
10741,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],While to my ear from uplands far away
10742,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"The bleating of the folded flocks is borne,"
10743,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"With distant cries of reapers in the corn,--"
10744,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],All the live murmur of a summer’s day.
10745,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10746,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Screened is this nook o’er the high, half-reaped field,"
10747,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And here till sundown, shepherd! will I be."
10748,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Through the thick corn the scarlet poppies peep,"
10749,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And round green roots and yellowing stalks I see
10750,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Pale blue convolvulus in tendrils creep;
10751,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And air-swept lindens yield
10752,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Their scent, and rustle down their perfumed showers"
10753,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Of bloom on the bent grass where I am laid,"
10754,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And bower me from the August-sun with shade;
10755,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And the eye travels down to Oxford’s towers.
10756,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10757,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And near me on the grass lies Glanvil’s book.
10758,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Come, let me read the oft-read tale again!"
10759,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"The story of that Oxford scholar poor,"
10760,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Of shining parts and quick inventive brain,"
10761,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Who, tired of knocking at preferment’s door,"
10762,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],One summer-morn forsook
10763,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"His friends, and went to learn the gypsy-lore,"
10764,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And roamed the world with that wild brotherhood,"
10765,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And came, as most men deemed, to little good,"
10766,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],But came to Oxford and his friends no more.
10767,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10768,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"But once, years after, in the country-lanes,"
10769,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Two scholars, whom at college erst he knew,"
10770,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Met him, and of his way of life inquired;"
10771,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Whereat he answered, that the gypsy-crew,"
10772,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"His mates, had arts to rule as they desired"
10773,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"The workings of men’s brains,"
10774,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And they can bind them to what thoughts they will.
10775,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"“And I,” he said, “the secret of their art,"
10776,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"When fully learned, will to the world impart;"
10777,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],But it needs Heaven-sent moments for this skill.”
10778,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10779,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"This said, he left them, and returned no more."
10780,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"But rumors hung about the country-side,"
10781,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"That the lost Scholar long was seen to stray,"
10782,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Seen by rare glimpses, pensive and tongue-tied,"
10783,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"In hat of antique shape, and cloak of gray,"
10784,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],The same the gypsies wore.
10785,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Shepherds had met him on the Hurst in spring;
10786,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"At some lone alehouse in the Berkshire moors,"
10787,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"On the warm ingle-bench, the smock-frocked boors"
10788,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Had found him seated at their entering;
10789,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10790,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"But, ’mid their drink and clatter, he would fly."
10791,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And I myself seem half to know thy looks,"
10792,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And put the shepherds, wanderer! on thy trace;"
10793,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And boys who in lone wheat-fields scare the rooks
10794,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],I ask if thou hast passed their quiet place;
10795,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Or in my boat I lie
10796,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Moored to the cool bank in the summer-heats,"
10797,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Mid wide grass meadows which the sunshine fills,"
10798,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And watch the warm, green-muffled Cumner hills,"
10799,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And wonder if thou haunt’st their shy retreats.
10800,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10801,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"For most, I know, thou lov’st retired ground!"
10802,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Thee at the ferry Oxford riders blithe,"
10803,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Returning home on summer-nights, have met"
10804,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Crossing the stripling Thames at Bab-lock-hithe,"
10805,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Trailing in the cool stream thy fingers wet,"
10806,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],As the punt’s rope chops round;
10807,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And leaning backward in a pensive dream,"
10808,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And fostering in thy lap a heap of flowers
10809,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Plucked in shy fields and distant Wychwood bowers,"
10810,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And thine eyes resting on the moonlit stream.
10811,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10812,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And then they land, and thou art seen no more!"
10813,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Maidens, who from the distant hamlets come"
10814,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"To dance around the Fyfield elm in May,"
10815,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Oft through the darkening fields have seen thee roam,"
10816,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Or cross a stile into the public way;
10817,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Oft thou hast given them store
10818,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Of flowers,--the frail-leafed, white anemone,"
10819,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Dark bluebells drenched with dews of summer eves,"
10820,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And purple orchises with spotted leaves,--"
10821,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],But none hath words she can report of thee!
10822,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10823,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And, above Godstow Bridge, when hay-time’s here"
10824,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"In June, and many a scythe in sunshine flames,"
10825,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Men who through those wide fields of breezy grass,"
10826,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Where black-winged swallows haunt the glittering Thames,"
10827,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"To bathe in the abandoned lasher pass,"
10828,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Have often passed thee near
10829,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Sitting upon the river-bank o’ergrown;
10830,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Marked thine outlandish garb, thy figure spare,"
10831,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Thy dark vague eyes, and soft abstracted air:"
10832,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"But, when they came from bathing, thou wast gone!"
10833,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10834,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"At some lone homestead in the Cumner hills,"
10835,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Where at her open door the housewife darns,"
10836,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Thou hast been seen, or hanging on a gate"
10837,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],To watch the threshers in the mossy barns.
10838,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Children, who early range these slopes and late"
10839,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"For cresses from the rills,"
10840,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Have known thee eying, all an April-day,"
10841,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],The springing pastures and the feeding kine;
10842,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And marked thee, when the stars come out and shine,"
10843,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Through the long dewy grass move slow away.
10844,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10845,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"In autumn, on the skirts of Bagley Wood,--"
10846,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Where most the gypsies by the turf-edged way
10847,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Pitch their smoked tents, and every bush you see"
10848,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"With scarlet patches tagged and shreds of gray,"
10849,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Above the forest ground called Thessaly,--"
10850,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],The blackbird picking food
10851,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Sees thee, nor stops his meal, nor fears at all;"
10852,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"So often has he known thee past him stray,"
10853,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Rapt, twirling in thy hand a withered spray,"
10854,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And waiting for the spark from heaven to fall.
10855,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10856,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And once, in winter, on the causeway chill"
10857,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Where home through flooded fields foot-travellers go,"
10858,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Have I not passed thee on the wooden bridge
10859,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Wrapped in thy cloak and battling with the snow,"
10860,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Thy face toward Hinksey and its wintry ridge?
10861,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And thou hast climbed the hill,"
10862,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And gained the white brow of the Cumner range;
10863,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Turned once to watch, while thick the snowflakes fall,"
10864,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],The line of festal light in Christ-church hall:
10865,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Then sought thy straw in some sequestered grange.
10866,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10867,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],But what--I dream! Two hundred years are flown
10868,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Since first thy story ran through Oxford halls,"
10869,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And the grave Glanvil did the tale inscribe
10870,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],That thou wert wandered from the studious walls
10871,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"To learn strange arts, and join a gypsy-tribe."
10872,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And thou from earth art gone
10873,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Long since, and in some quiet churchyard laid,--"
10874,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Some country-nook, where o’er thy unknown grave"
10875,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Tall grasses and white flowering nettles wave,"
10876,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Under a dark, red-fruited yew-tree’s shade."
10877,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10878,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"--No, no, thou hast not felt the lapse of hours!"
10879,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],For what wears out the life of mortal men?
10880,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],’Tis that from change to change their being rolls;
10881,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"’Tis that repeated shocks, again, again,"
10882,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Exhaust the energy of strongest souls,"
10883,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And numb the elastic powers,"
10884,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Till having used our nerves with bliss and teen,"
10885,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And tired upon a thousand schemes our wit,"
10886,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],To the just-pausing Genius we remit
10887,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Our well-worn life, and are--what we have been."
10888,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10889,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Thou hast not lived, why shouldst thou perish, so?"
10890,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Thou hadst _one_ aim, _one_ business, _one_ desire;"
10891,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Else wert thou long since numbered with thedead!
10892,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Else hadst thou spent, like other men, thy fire!"
10893,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"The generations of thy peers are fled,"
10894,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And we ourselves shall go;
10895,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"But thou possessest an immortal lot,"
10896,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And we imagine thee exempt from age,"
10897,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And living as thou liv’st on Glanvil’s page,"
10898,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Because thou hadst--what we, alas! have not."
10899,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10900,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"For early didst thou leave the world, with powers"
10901,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Fresh, undiverted to the world without,"
10902,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Firm to their mark, not spent on other things;"
10903,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Free from the sick fatigue, the languid doubt,"
10904,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Which much to have tried, in much been baffled, brings."
10905,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],O life unlike to ours!
10906,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Who fluctuate idly without term or scope,"
10907,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Of whom each strives, nor knows for what he strives,"
10908,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And each half lives a hundred different lives;
10909,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Who wait like thee, but not, like thee, in hope."
10910,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10911,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Thou waitest for the spark from heaven! and we,"
10912,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Light half-believers of our casual creeds,"
10913,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Who never deeply felt, nor clearly willed,"
10914,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Whose insight never has borne fruit in deeds,"
10915,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Whose vague resolves never have been fulfilled;
10916,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],For whom each year we see
10917,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Breeds new beginnings, disappointments new;"
10918,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Who hesitate and falter life away,"
10919,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And lose to-morrow the ground won to-day--
10920,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Ah! do not we, wanderer! await it too?"
10921,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10922,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Yes, we await it! but it still delays,"
10923,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And then we suffer! and amongst us one,"
10924,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Who most has suffered, takes dejectedly"
10925,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],His seat upon the intellectual throne;
10926,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And all his store of sad experience he
10927,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Lays bare of wretched days;
10928,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Tells us his misery’s birth and growth and signs,"
10929,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And how the dying spark of hope was fed,"
10930,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And how the breast was soothed, and how the head,"
10931,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And all his hourly varied anodynes.
10932,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10933,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"This for our wisest! and we others pine,"
10934,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And wish the long unhappy dream would end,"
10935,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And waive all claim to bliss, and try to bear;"
10936,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"With close-lipped patience for our only friend,--"
10937,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Sad patience, too near neighbor to despair,--"
10938,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],But none has hope like thine!
10939,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Thou through the fields and through the woods dost stray,"
10940,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Roaming the country-side, a truant boy,"
10941,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Nursing thy project in unclouded joy,"
10942,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And every doubt long blown by time away.
10943,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10944,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Oh, born in days when wits were fresh and clear,"
10945,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And life ran gayly as the sparkling Thames;
10946,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Before this strange disease of modern life,"
10947,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"With its sick hurry, its divided aims,"
10948,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Its heads o’ertaxed, its palsied hearts, was rife,--"
10949,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Fly hence, our contact fear!"
10950,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Still fly, plunge deeper in the bowering wood!"
10951,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Averse, as Dido did with gesture stern"
10952,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"From her false friend’s approach in Hades turn,"
10953,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Wave us away, and keep thy solitude!"
10954,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10955,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Still nursing the unconquerable hope,"
10956,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Still clutching the inviolable shade,"
10957,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"With a free, onward impulse brushing through,"
10958,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"By night, the silvered branches of the glade,--"
10959,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Far on the forest-skirts, where none pursue,"
10960,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],On some mild pastoral slope
10961,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Emerge, and resting on the moonlit pales"
10962,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Freshen thy flowers as in former years
10963,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"With dew, or listen with enchanted ears,"
10964,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"From the dark dingles, to the nightingales!"
10965,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10966,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"But fly our paths, our feverish contact fly!"
10967,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"For strong the infection of our mental strife,"
10968,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Which, though it gives no bliss, yet spoils for rest;"
10969,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And we should win thee from thy own fair life,"
10970,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Like us distracted, and like us unblest."
10971,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Soon, soon thy cheer would die,"
10972,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Thy hopes grow timorous, and unfixed thy powers,"
10973,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And thy clear aims be cross and shifting made;
10974,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And then thy glad perennial youth would fade,"
10975,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Fade, and grow old at last, and die like ours."
10976,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10977,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Then fly our greetings, fly our speech and smiles!"
10978,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"--As some grave Tyrian trader, from the sea,"
10979,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Descried at sunrise an emerging prow
10980,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Lifting the cool-haired creepers stealthily,"
10981,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],The fringes of a southward-facing brow
10982,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],Among the Ægean isles;
10983,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And saw the merry Grecian coaster come,"
10984,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Freighted with amber grapes, and Chian wine,"
10985,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Green bursting figs, and tunnies steeped in brine,"
10986,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And knew the intruders on his ancient home,--"
10987,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],
10988,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"The young light-hearted masters of the waves,--"
10989,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"And snatched his rudder, and shook out more sail,"
10990,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And day and night held on indignantly
10991,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"O’er the blue Midland waters with the gale,"
10992,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Betwixt the Syrtes and soft Sicily,"
10993,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],To where the Atlantic raves
10994,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Outside the western straits, and unbent sails"
10995,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"There where down cloudy cliffs, through sheets of foam,"
10996,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],"Shy traffickers, the dark Iberians come;"
10997,_THE SCHOLAR-GYPSY._[17],And on the beach undid his corded bales.

11005,_THYRSIS._[18],"_A MONODY, to commemorate the author’s friend, ARTHUR HUGH CLOUGH, who"
11006,_THYRSIS._[18],"died at Florence, 1861._"
11007,_THYRSIS._[18],
11008,_THYRSIS._[18],How changed is here each spot man makes or fills!
11009,_THYRSIS._[18],In the two Hinkseys nothing keeps the same;
11010,_THYRSIS._[18],"The village street its haunted mansion lacks,"
11011,_THYRSIS._[18],"And from the sign is gone Sibylla’s name,"
11012,_THYRSIS._[18],And from the roofs the twisted chimney-stacks.--
11013,_THYRSIS._[18],"Are ye too changed, ye hills?"
11014,_THYRSIS._[18],"See, ’tis no foot of unfamiliar men"
11015,_THYRSIS._[18],To-night from Oxford up your pathway strays!
11016,_THYRSIS._[18],"Here came I often, often, in old days,--"
11017,_THYRSIS._[18],Thyrsis and I: we still had Thyrsis then.
11018,_THYRSIS._[18],
11019,_THYRSIS._[18],"Runs it not here, the track by Childsworth Farm,"
11020,_THYRSIS._[18],"Past the high wood, to where the elm-tree crowns"
11021,_THYRSIS._[18],The hill behind whose ridge the sunset flames?
11022,_THYRSIS._[18],"The single-elm, that looks on Ilsley Downs,"
11023,_THYRSIS._[18],"The Vale, the three lone wears, the youthful Thames?"
11024,_THYRSIS._[18],This winter-eve is warm;
11025,_THYRSIS._[18],"Humid the air; leafless, yet soft as spring,"
11026,_THYRSIS._[18],The tender purple spray on copse and briers;
11027,_THYRSIS._[18],"And that sweet city with her dreaming spires,"
11028,_THYRSIS._[18],She needs not June for beauty’s heightening.
11029,_THYRSIS._[18],
11030,_THYRSIS._[18],"Lovely all times she lies, lovely to-night!--"
11031,_THYRSIS._[18],"Only, methinks, some loss of habit’s power"
11032,_THYRSIS._[18],Befalls me wandering through this upland dim.
11033,_THYRSIS._[18],"Once passed I blindfold here, at any hour;"
11034,_THYRSIS._[18],"Now seldom come I, since I came with him."
11035,_THYRSIS._[18],That single elm-tree bright
11036,_THYRSIS._[18],Against the west--I miss it! is it gone?
11037,_THYRSIS._[18],"We prized it dearly; while it stood, we said,"
11038,_THYRSIS._[18],Our friend the Gypsy-Scholar was not dead;
11039,_THYRSIS._[18],"While the tree lived, he in these fields lived on."
11040,_THYRSIS._[18],
11041,_THYRSIS._[18],"Too rare, too rare, grow now my visits here,"
11042,_THYRSIS._[18],"But once I knew each field, each flower, each stick;"
11043,_THYRSIS._[18],And with the country-folk acquaintance made
11044,_THYRSIS._[18],"By barn in threshing-time, by new-built rick."
11045,_THYRSIS._[18],"Here, too, our shepherd-pipes we first assayed."
11046,_THYRSIS._[18],Ah me! this many a year
11047,_THYRSIS._[18],"My pipe is lost, my shepherd’s-holiday!"
11048,_THYRSIS._[18],"Needs must I lose them, needs with heavy heart"
11049,_THYRSIS._[18],"Into the world and wave of men depart,"
11050,_THYRSIS._[18],But Thyrsis of his own will went away.
11051,_THYRSIS._[18],
11052,_THYRSIS._[18],"It irked him to be here, he could not rest."
11053,_THYRSIS._[18],"He loved each simple joy the country yields,"
11054,_THYRSIS._[18],"He loved his mates; but yet he could not keep,"
11055,_THYRSIS._[18],"For that a shadow lowered on the fields,"
11056,_THYRSIS._[18],Here with the shepherds and the silly sheep.
11057,_THYRSIS._[18],Some life of men unblest
11058,_THYRSIS._[18],"He knew, which made him droop, and filled his head."
11059,_THYRSIS._[18],He went; his piping took a troubled sound
11060,_THYRSIS._[18],Of storms that rage outside our happy ground;
11061,_THYRSIS._[18],He could not wait their passing; he is dead.
11062,_THYRSIS._[18],
11063,_THYRSIS._[18],"So, some tempestuous morn in early June,"
11064,_THYRSIS._[18],"When the year’s primal burst of bloom is o’er,"
11065,_THYRSIS._[18],"Before the roses and the longest day,--"
11066,_THYRSIS._[18],"When garden-walks, and all the grassy floor,"
11067,_THYRSIS._[18],"With blossoms red and white of fallen May,"
11068,_THYRSIS._[18],"And chestnut-flowers, are strewn,--"
11069,_THYRSIS._[18],"So have I heard the cuckoo’s parting cry,"
11070,_THYRSIS._[18],"From the wet field, through the vexed garden-trees,"
11071,_THYRSIS._[18],Come with the volleying rain and tossing breeze:
11072,_THYRSIS._[18],"_The bloom is gone, and with the bloom go I_!"
11073,_THYRSIS._[18],
11074,_THYRSIS._[18],"Too quick despairer, wherefore wilt thou go?"
11075,_THYRSIS._[18],"Soon will the high midsummer pomps come on,"
11076,_THYRSIS._[18],"Soon will the musk carnations break and swell,"
11077,_THYRSIS._[18],"Soon shall we have gold-dusted snapdragon,"
11078,_THYRSIS._[18],"Sweet-william with his homely cottage-smell,"
11079,_THYRSIS._[18],And stocks in fragrant blow;
11080,_THYRSIS._[18],"Roses that down the alleys shine afar,"
11081,_THYRSIS._[18],"And open, jasmine-muffled lattices,"
11082,_THYRSIS._[18],"And groups under the dreaming garden-trees,"
11083,_THYRSIS._[18],"And the full moon, and the white evening-star."
11084,_THYRSIS._[18],
11085,_THYRSIS._[18],"He hearkens not! light comer, he is flown!"
11086,_THYRSIS._[18],"What matters it? next year he will return,"
11087,_THYRSIS._[18],"And we shall have him in the sweet spring-days,"
11088,_THYRSIS._[18],"With whitening hedges, and uncrumpling fern,"
11089,_THYRSIS._[18],"And bluebells trembling by the forest-ways,"
11090,_THYRSIS._[18],And scent of hay new-mown.
11091,_THYRSIS._[18],"But Thyrsis never more we swains shall see,--"
11092,_THYRSIS._[18],"See him come back, and cut a smoother reed,"
11093,_THYRSIS._[18],And blow a strain the world at last shall heed;
11094,_THYRSIS._[18],"For Time, not Corydon, hath conquered thee!"
11095,_THYRSIS._[18],
11096,_THYRSIS._[18],"Alack, for Corydon no rival now!--"
11097,_THYRSIS._[18],"But when Sicilian shepherds lost a mate,"
11098,_THYRSIS._[18],"Some good survivor with his flute would go,"
11099,_THYRSIS._[18],Piping a ditty sad for Bion’s fate;
11100,_THYRSIS._[18],"And cross the unpermitted ferry’s flow,"
11101,_THYRSIS._[18],"And relax Pluto’s brow,"
11102,_THYRSIS._[18],And make leap up with joy the beauteous head
11103,_THYRSIS._[18],"Of Proserpine, among whose crownèd hair"
11104,_THYRSIS._[18],"Are flowers first opened on Sicilian air,"
11105,_THYRSIS._[18],"And flute his friend, like Orpheus, from the dead."
11106,_THYRSIS._[18],
11107,_THYRSIS._[18],"Oh, easy access to the hearer’s grace"
11108,_THYRSIS._[18],When Dorian shepherds sang to Proserpine!
11109,_THYRSIS._[18],"For she herself had trod Sicilian fields,"
11110,_THYRSIS._[18],"She knew the Dorian water’s gush divine,"
11111,_THYRSIS._[18],"She knew each lily white which Enna yields,"
11112,_THYRSIS._[18],Each rose with blushing face;
11113,_THYRSIS._[18],"She loved the Dorian pipe, the Dorian strain."
11114,_THYRSIS._[18],But ah! of our poor Thames she never heard;
11115,_THYRSIS._[18],Her foot the Cumner cowslips never stirred;
11116,_THYRSIS._[18],And we should tease her with our plaint in vain.
11117,_THYRSIS._[18],
11118,_THYRSIS._[18],Well! wind-dispersed and vain the words will be;
11119,_THYRSIS._[18],"Yet, Thyrsis, let me give my grief its hour"
11120,_THYRSIS._[18],"In the old haunt, and find our tree-topped hill!"
11121,_THYRSIS._[18],"Who, if not I, for questing here hath power?"
11122,_THYRSIS._[18],I know the wood which hides the daffodil;
11123,_THYRSIS._[18],I know the Fyfield tree;
11124,_THYRSIS._[18],"I know what white, what purple fritillaries"
11125,_THYRSIS._[18],"The grassy harvest of the river-fields,"
11126,_THYRSIS._[18],"Above by Ensham, down by Sandford, yields;"
11127,_THYRSIS._[18],And what sedged brooks are Thames’s tributaries;
11128,_THYRSIS._[18],
11129,_THYRSIS._[18],I know these slopes: who knows them if not I?
11130,_THYRSIS._[18],"But many a dingle on the loved hillside,"
11131,_THYRSIS._[18],"With thorns once studded, old white-blossomed trees,"
11132,_THYRSIS._[18],"Where thick the cowslips grew, and far descried"
11133,_THYRSIS._[18],"High towered the spikes of purple orchises,"
11134,_THYRSIS._[18],Hath since our day put by
11135,_THYRSIS._[18],The coronals of that forgotten time;
11136,_THYRSIS._[18],"Down each green bank hath gone the ploughboy’s team,"
11137,_THYRSIS._[18],And only in the hidden brookside gleam
11138,_THYRSIS._[18],"Primroses, orphans of the flowery prime."
11139,_THYRSIS._[18],
11140,_THYRSIS._[18],"Where is the girl who by the boatman’s door,"
11141,_THYRSIS._[18],"Above the locks, above the boating throng,"
11142,_THYRSIS._[18],"Unmoored our skiff when through the Wytham flats,"
11143,_THYRSIS._[18],"Red loosestrife and blond meadow-sweet among,"
11144,_THYRSIS._[18],"And darting swallows and light water-gnats,"
11145,_THYRSIS._[18],We tracked the shy Thames shore?
11146,_THYRSIS._[18],"Where are the mowers, who, as the tiny swell"
11147,_THYRSIS._[18],"Of our boat passing heaved the river-grass,"
11148,_THYRSIS._[18],Stood with suspended scythe to see us pass?--
11149,_THYRSIS._[18],"They all are gone, and thou art gone as well!"
11150,_THYRSIS._[18],
11151,_THYRSIS._[18],"Yes, thou art gone! and round me too the night"
11152,_THYRSIS._[18],In ever-nearing circle weaves her shade.
11153,_THYRSIS._[18],"I see her veil draw soft across the day,"
11154,_THYRSIS._[18],I feel her slowly chilling breath invade
11155,_THYRSIS._[18],"The cheek grown thin, the brown hair sprent with gray;"
11156,_THYRSIS._[18],I feel her finger light
11157,_THYRSIS._[18],"Laid pausefully upon life’s headlong train,--"
11158,_THYRSIS._[18],"The foot less prompt to meet the morning dew,"
11159,_THYRSIS._[18],"The heart less bounding at emotion new,"
11160,_THYRSIS._[18],"And hope, once crushed, less quick to spring again."
11161,_THYRSIS._[18],
11162,_THYRSIS._[18],"And long the way appears, which seemed so short"
11163,_THYRSIS._[18],To the less-practised eye of sanguine youth;
11164,_THYRSIS._[18],"And high the mountain tops, in cloudy air,--"
11165,_THYRSIS._[18],"The mountain tops where is the throne of Truth,"
11166,_THYRSIS._[18],Tops in life’s morning-sun so bright and bare!
11167,_THYRSIS._[18],Unbreachable the fort
11168,_THYRSIS._[18],Of the long-battered world uplifts its wall;
11169,_THYRSIS._[18],"And strange and vain the earthly turmoil grows,"
11170,_THYRSIS._[18],"And near and real the charm of thy repose,"
11171,_THYRSIS._[18],And night as welcome as a friend would fall.
11172,_THYRSIS._[18],
11173,_THYRSIS._[18],But hush! the upland hath a sudden loss
11174,_THYRSIS._[18],"Of quiet! Look, adown the dusk hillside,"
11175,_THYRSIS._[18],"A troop of Oxford hunters going home,"
11176,_THYRSIS._[18],"As in old days, jovial and talking, ride!"
11177,_THYRSIS._[18],From hunting with the Berkshire hounds they come.
11178,_THYRSIS._[18],"Quick! let me fly, and cross"
11179,_THYRSIS._[18],"Into yon farther field! ’Tis done; and see,"
11180,_THYRSIS._[18],"Backed by the sunset, which doth glorify"
11181,_THYRSIS._[18],"The orange and pale violet evening-sky,"
11182,_THYRSIS._[18],"Bare on its lonely ridge, the Tree! the Tree!"
11183,_THYRSIS._[18],
11184,_THYRSIS._[18],"I take the omen! Eve lets down her veil,"
11185,_THYRSIS._[18],"The white fog creeps from bush to bush about,"
11186,_THYRSIS._[18],"The west unflushes, the high stars grow bright,"
11187,_THYRSIS._[18],And in the scattered farms the lights come out.
11188,_THYRSIS._[18],"I cannot reach the signal-tree to-night,"
11189,_THYRSIS._[18],"Yet, happy omen, hail!"
11190,_THYRSIS._[18],Hear it from thy broad lucent Arno-vale
11191,_THYRSIS._[18],(For there thine earth-forgetting eyelids keep
11192,_THYRSIS._[18],The morningless and unawakening sleep
11193,_THYRSIS._[18],Under the flowery oleanders pale);
11194,_THYRSIS._[18],
11195,_THYRSIS._[18],"Hear it, O Thyrsis, still our tree is there!--"
11196,_THYRSIS._[18],"Ah, vain! These English fields, this upland dim,"
11197,_THYRSIS._[18],"These brambles pale with mist engarlanded,"
11198,_THYRSIS._[18],"That lone, sky-pointing tree, are not for him:"
11199,_THYRSIS._[18],"To a boon southern country he is fled,"
11200,_THYRSIS._[18],"And now in happier air,"
11201,_THYRSIS._[18],Wandering with the great Mother’s train divine
11202,_THYRSIS._[18],"(And purer or more subtile soul than thee,"
11203,_THYRSIS._[18],I trow the mighty Mother doth not see)
11204,_THYRSIS._[18],"Within a folding of the Apennine,--"
11205,_THYRSIS._[18],
11206,_THYRSIS._[18],Thou hearest the immortal chants of old!
11207,_THYRSIS._[18],Putting his sickle to the perilous grain
11208,_THYRSIS._[18],"In the hot cornfield of the Phrygian king,"
11209,_THYRSIS._[18],For thee the Lityerses-song again
11210,_THYRSIS._[18],Young Daphnis with his silver voice doth sing;[19]
11211,_THYRSIS._[18],"Sings his Sicilian fold,"
11212,_THYRSIS._[18],"His sheep, his hapless love, his blinded eyes;"
11213,_THYRSIS._[18],"And how a call celestial round him rang,"
11214,_THYRSIS._[18],"And heavenward from the fountain-brink he sprang,"
11215,_THYRSIS._[18],And all the marvel of the golden skies.
11216,_THYRSIS._[18],
11217,_THYRSIS._[18],"There thou art gone, and me thou leavest here"
11218,_THYRSIS._[18],Sole in these fields! yet will I not despair.
11219,_THYRSIS._[18],"Despair I will not, while I yet descry"
11220,_THYRSIS._[18],’Neath the soft canopy of English air
11221,_THYRSIS._[18],That lonely tree against the western sky.
11222,_THYRSIS._[18],"Still, still these slopes, ’tis clear,"
11223,_THYRSIS._[18],"Our Gypsy-Scholar haunts, outliving thee!"
11224,_THYRSIS._[18],"Fields where soft sheep from cages pull the hay,"

11227,_THYRSIS._[18],
11228,_THYRSIS._[18],"A fugitive and gracious light he seeks,"
11229,_THYRSIS._[18],Shy to illumine; and I seek it too.
11230,_THYRSIS._[18],"This does not come with houses or with gold,"
11231,_THYRSIS._[18],"With place, with honor, and a flattering crew;"
11232,_THYRSIS._[18],’Tis not in the world’s market bought and sold;
11233,_THYRSIS._[18],But the smooth-slipping weeks
11234,_THYRSIS._[18],"Drop by, and leave its seeker still untired;"
11235,_THYRSIS._[18],"Out of the heed of mortals he is gone,"
11236,_THYRSIS._[18],"He wends unfollowed, he must house alone;"
11237,_THYRSIS._[18],"Yet on he fares, by his own heart inspired."
11238,_THYRSIS._[18],
11239,_THYRSIS._[18],"Thou too, O Thyrsis, on like quest wast bound!"
11240,_THYRSIS._[18],Thou wanderedst with me for a little hour.
11241,_THYRSIS._[18],"Men gave thee nothing; but this happy quest,"
11242,_THYRSIS._[18],"If men esteemed thee feeble, gave thee power,"
11243,_THYRSIS._[18],"If men procured thee trouble, gave thee rest."
11244,_THYRSIS._[18],"And this rude Cumner ground,"
11245,_THYRSIS._[18],"Its fir-topped Hurst, its farms, its quiet fields,"
11246,_THYRSIS._[18],"Here cam’st thou in thy jocund youthful time,"
11247,_THYRSIS._[18],"Here was thine height of strength, thy golden prime!"
11248,_THYRSIS._[18],And still the haunt beloved a virtue yields.
11249,_THYRSIS._[18],
11250,_THYRSIS._[18],What though the music of thy rustic flute
11251,_THYRSIS._[18],"Kept not for long its happy, country tone;"
11252,_THYRSIS._[18],"Lost it too soon, and learnt a stormy note"
11253,_THYRSIS._[18],"Of men contention-tost, of men who groan,"
11254,_THYRSIS._[18],"Which tasked thy pipe too sore, and tired thy throat--"
11255,_THYRSIS._[18],"It failed, and thou wast mute!"
11256,_THYRSIS._[18],"Yet hadst thou alway visions of our light,"
11257,_THYRSIS._[18],"And long with men of care thou couldst not stay,"
11258,_THYRSIS._[18],"And soon thy foot resumed its wandering way,"
11259,_THYRSIS._[18],"Left human haunt, and on alone till night."
11260,_THYRSIS._[18],
11261,_THYRSIS._[18],"Too rare, too rare, grow now my visits here!"
11262,_THYRSIS._[18],"’Mid city-noise, not, as with thee of yore,"
11263,_THYRSIS._[18],Thyrsis! in reach of sheep-bells is my home.
11264,_THYRSIS._[18],"--Then through the great town’s harsh, heart-wearying roar,"
11265,_THYRSIS._[18],"Let in thy voice a whisper often come,"
11266,_THYRSIS._[18],To chase fatigue and fear:
11267,_THYRSIS._[18],_Why faintest thou? I wandered till I died._
11268,_THYRSIS._[18],_Roam on! The light we sought is shining still._

12924,OBERMANN.,“The brooding East with awe beheld

12939,OBERMANN.,"“‘Poor world!’ she cried, ‘so deep accurst,"

12948,OBERMANN.,
12949,OBERMANN.,"“She vailed her eagles, snapped her sword,"

12953,OBERMANN.,
12954,OBERMANN.,"“She broke her flutes, she stopped her sports,"

12958,OBERMANN.,
12959,OBERMANN.,"“Lust of the eye, and pride of life,"

12964,OBERMANN.,“Tears washed the trouble from her face;

12978,OBERMANN.,
12979,OBERMANN.,“No cloister-floor of humid stone

12983,OBERMANN.,
12984,OBERMANN.,"“No lonely life had passed too slow,"

12995,OBERMANN.,"Still, still went forth that Child’s dear force,"
12996,OBERMANN.,And still was at its prime.
12997,OBERMANN.,
12998,OBERMANN.,"“Ay, ages long endured his span"

13002,OBERMANN.,
13003,OBERMANN.,"“While we believed, on earth he went,"
13004,OBERMANN.,And open stood his grave;
13005,OBERMANN.,"Men called from chamber, church, and tent,"
13006,OBERMANN.,And Christ was by to save.
13007,OBERMANN.,
13008,OBERMANN.,“Now he is dead! Far hence he lies

13017,OBERMANN.,
13018,OBERMANN.,“Ah! from that silent sacred land
13019,OBERMANN.,"Of sun, and arid stone,"

13023,OBERMANN.,“From David’s lips that word did roll;

13033,OBERMANN.,"“But slow that tide of common thought,"
13034,OBERMANN.,"Which bathed our life, retired;"
13035,OBERMANN.,"Slow, slow the old world wore to naught,"
13036,OBERMANN.,And pulse by pulse expired.
13037,OBERMANN.,
13038,OBERMANN.,"“Its frame yet stood without a breach,"

13218,OBERMANN.,"Past Sonchaud’s piny flanks I gaze,"

13222,OBERMANN.,
13223,OBERMANN.,"And the domed Velan, with his snows,"
13224,OBERMANN.,"Behind the upcrowding hills,"
13225,OBERMANN.,Doth all the heavenly opening close
13226,OBERMANN.,Which the Rhone’s murmur fills;

13283,"NOTE [5], PAGE 59.",
13284,"NOTE [5], PAGE 59.",“The young Sohrab was the fruit of one of Rustum’s early amours. He
13285,"NOTE [5], PAGE 59.","had left his mother, and sought fame under the banners of Afrasiab,"
13286,"NOTE [5], PAGE 59.",whose armies he commanded; and soon obtained a renown beyond that
13287,"NOTE [5], PAGE 59.",of all contemporary heroes but his father. He had carried death and
13288,"NOTE [5], PAGE 59.","dismay into the ranks of the Persians, and had terrified the boldest"
13289,"NOTE [5], PAGE 59.","warriors of that country, before Rustum encountered him, which at last"

13292,"NOTE [5], PAGE 59.","advantage; the second, the youth obtained a victory, but granted"
13293,"NOTE [5], PAGE 59.","life to his unknown father; the third was fatal to Sohrab, who, when"
13294,"NOTE [5], PAGE 59.","writhing in the pangs of death, warned his conqueror to shun the"
13295,"NOTE [5], PAGE 59.","vengeance that is inspired by parental woes, and bade him dread the"
13296,"NOTE [5], PAGE 59.","rage of the mighty Rustum, who must soon learn that he had slain his"
13297,"NOTE [5], PAGE 59.","son Sohrab. These words, we are told, were as death to the aged hero;"
13298,"NOTE [5], PAGE 59.","and when he recovered from a trance, he called in despair for proofs"
