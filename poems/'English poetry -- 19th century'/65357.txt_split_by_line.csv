51,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
52,PREFACE.,
53,PREFACE.,
54,PREFACE.,"To court applause by oblique dexterity, or without a due sense of"
55,PREFACE.,"respect for public opinion, impertinently to advance pretensions, is"
56,PREFACE.,equally revolting to the feelings of an ingenuous mind. But as genius
57,PREFACE.,"and a desire of fame are naturally allied, and, perhaps, the former"
58,PREFACE.,never existed without the latter; will not the youthful adventurer be
59,PREFACE.,justified in endeavouring to stand well in the opinion of the judicious
60,PREFACE.,"and discerning, by disseminating his works among them--under a"
61,PREFACE.,"confidence, that the more candid will be pleased with the first blossoms"
62,PREFACE.,"of poetical talent, not only as the fruits of industry, but as presages"
63,PREFACE.,in maturer years of more elevated titles to distinction? With these
64,PREFACE.,"impressions, the Author of the following Poems has been induced, by the"
65,PREFACE.,"advice of his friends, to offer the present Collection to the public."
66,PREFACE.,"The praise of friends, I am aware, is not always a sufficient reason for"
67,PREFACE.,"publication;--and pieces of poetry, dictated by some local occurrence,"
68,PREFACE.,"or intended as a tribute of politeness or affection to some individual,"
69,PREFACE.,"though at first much admired, may, nevertheless scarcely deserve to be"
70,PREFACE.,transmitted to posterity. I am well aware that the strict eye of
71,PREFACE.,"criticism may discover imperfections, and that a nice ear may, perhaps,"
72,PREFACE.,"occasionally be hurt by a harsh line;--and, that some, from a dread of"
73,PREFACE.,"inspiring into a young mind, a taste for extra-academical fame, may be"
74,PREFACE.,disposed to extinguish altogether such attempts--yet it would be
75,PREFACE.,"straining delicacy beyond convenient bounds, if we did not cherish the"
76,PREFACE.,"idea, that there may be others, who may be pleased to look propitiously"
77,PREFACE.,on the first specimens of genius at so early an age--many of them having
78,PREFACE.,"been written when the Author had attained only his Thirteenth year, and"
79,PREFACE.,the whole before he had completed Fifteen years of age. Their claims are
80,PREFACE.,"not, _perhaps_, of that superior kind, which will find a place among the"
81,PREFACE.,first orders of poetry; but the pieces breathe throughout the true
82,PREFACE.,"spirit of virtuous sensibility, vigour of fancy, and that characteristic"
83,PREFACE.,"manner, which always accompanies strong power of invention;--they"
84,PREFACE.,"display richness of imagery, and elegance of style, while the language"
85,PREFACE.,"has an easy flow, and unaffected simplicity, free from that artificial"
86,PREFACE.,"splendor, and obscure magnificence, which modern taste seems to"
87,PREFACE.,establish as the excellence of poetical diction. Most of the larger
88,PREFACE.,"Poems in the Collection express in easy language, and at the same time"
89,PREFACE.,"with all the graces of genuine poetry, every sentiment fitted to the"
90,PREFACE.,"occasion on which they were written. Of this, among the lighter ones,"
91,PREFACE.,the reader will have an agreeable specimen in the verses dedicated to
92,PREFACE.,"Lady C---- L----, which though on a trivial subject, may, perhaps, give"
93,PREFACE.,"as just and pleasing an idea of this Writer’s poetical talents, as any"
94,PREFACE.,other single piece among the more trifling ones which we can collect.
95,PREFACE.,"The Translations of the first Chorus of Œdipus Tyrrannus, and two Odes"
96,PREFACE.,"of Horace, exhibit no small degree of classical attainment: and, however"
97,PREFACE.,"just or otherwise the remark may be, “that the failure of preceding"
98,PREFACE.,"translators has arisen, in a great measure, from a desire to copy the"
99,PREFACE.,variations of Horace’s measures;” the present ones convey a correct and
100,PREFACE.,"spirited explanation of the sense in general, and by observing"
101,PREFACE.,"circumstances and the little figures and turns on the words, (that"
102,PREFACE.,"_curiosa felicitas verborum_,) they have preserved the beauties, and"
103,PREFACE.,"kept alive that spirit and fire, which make the chief character of the"
104,PREFACE.,original.
105,PREFACE.,
106,PREFACE.,"It will not, therefore, be presuming too much, to hope that these Poems"
107,PREFACE.,may contain enough to draw from such as value the display of early
108,PREFACE.,"talents, a favourable reception; and that the Author, under such"
109,PREFACE.,"encouragement, when his taste is more matured, will perfect the produce"
110,PREFACE.,"of his youthful industry, and by diligence add to the stores of a mind"
111,PREFACE.,formed by nature to accumulate and decorate them--there is only left for
112,PREFACE.,"me to say,"

126,BY THE AUTHOR.,"Notwithstanding my friend has said so much and so flattering to myself,"
127,BY THE AUTHOR.,"in his Preface, yet the diffidence and the anxiety which ever accompany"
128,BY THE AUTHOR.,"a first attempt, particularly at so early an age, urge me to add a few"
129,BY THE AUTHOR.,"words, however superfluous they may appear. An apology is indeed,"
130,BY THE AUTHOR.,"perhaps, always requisite for an intrusion on the public, and I cannot,"
131,BY THE AUTHOR.,"therefore, refrain from offering one for some of the Poems which are"
132,BY THE AUTHOR.,inferior to the rest. They were written when but a child--they were the
133,BY THE AUTHOR.,"first faint dawnings of poetic enthusiasm,--and that sense of integrity,"
134,BY THE AUTHOR.,"which should accompany every action, prevented my now altering them, in"
135,BY THE AUTHOR.,any _material_ respect. I expressly state the age at which they were
136,BY THE AUTHOR.,"written, and I think it but a duty to the public, that they should"
137,BY THE AUTHOR.,"actually be written at that age. For the same reason, therefore, and not"
138,BY THE AUTHOR.,"from any arrogant vanity, I have been particularly careful that no other"
139,BY THE AUTHOR.,"hand should have polished, or improved them."
140,BY THE AUTHOR.,
141,BY THE AUTHOR.,"For the Battle of Waterloo, much ought to be said in apology, when so"
142,BY THE AUTHOR.,"many far, far more adequate to the task, than myself, have written upon"
143,BY THE AUTHOR.,"it; and when so many have failed in the attempt, it seems to argue"
144,BY THE AUTHOR.,"vanity in the design; but such, I may assert, was far from my mind, at"
145,BY THE AUTHOR.,the time of its composition. It was begun in a moment of enthusiasm--it
146,BY THE AUTHOR.,was continued from a deep interest in the undertaking--and it was
147,BY THE AUTHOR.,"completed from a dislike, I have always entertained, to leave any thing"
148,BY THE AUTHOR.,"unfinished. But I was myself very unwilling to commit it to the press,"
149,BY THE AUTHOR.,and only did so at the express and flattering desire of some intimate
150,BY THE AUTHOR.,"friends, who were, perhaps, too partial to perceive its defects."
151,BY THE AUTHOR.,
152,BY THE AUTHOR.,"To the generosity of the more lenient of the public, do I now confide"
153,BY THE AUTHOR.,"this first attempt for their favour; and, as they scan over the faults"
154,BY THE AUTHOR.,"with the eye of Criticism, may the hand of Mercy restrain them from"
155,BY THE AUTHOR.,dragging those faults to light.
156,BY THE AUTHOR.,
157,BY THE AUTHOR.,"The solicitude that I feel, would induce me to indulge in a tedious"
158,BY THE AUTHOR.,"prolixity; but I must remember, that none but _myself_ can be interested"
159,BY THE AUTHOR.,"in my _own_ feelings, and I will, therefore, no longer detain my readers"
160,BY THE AUTHOR.,from the proof.

385,II.,"And flying hence, to Pyrchilim the Brave,"
386,II.,"His sire’s illustrious friend, the child they gave:"
387,II.,"And there he grew, and every virtuous grace"

570,V.,There drops the widow’s tear--there heaves the sigh
571,V.,Of mourning sire--there sounds the orphan’s cry--
572,V.,"And there dark Azrail[7] sits, and grimly waves"
573,V.,His sable pinions o’er a thousand graves;
574,V.,Yet e’en his rugged soul is tir’d--his hand
575,V.,Would fain let drop his all-destructive brand--
576,V.,"Would gladly spread his deadly plumes, to fly"
577,V.,From such a scene of desolate misery.

579,V.,"For when Alvante’s brother claim’d a throne,"

588,V.,"Of red Rebellion, in Moratcham’s hand."
589,V.,"And, like some roaring whirlwind’s sweeping path,"
590,V.,That tears whole forests with its rabid wrath;                   240
591,V.,"Or, like some demon’s all-destroying form,"
592,V.,"That wings the blast, and rides the gath’ring storm:"

594,V.,The luckless chiefs of Tauris sweep away.
595,V.,
596,V.,"Whence is that piercing scream?--Oh, turn thine eye"

598,V.,Yon maiden lov’d yon lifeless youth; he fell
599,V.,"Beneath Alvante’s rage,--the rest too well"
600,V.,"That scream has told;--wide floats her streaming hair,"
601,V.,"As if to ask compassion of the air,                              250"
602,V.,"And her dark eye-balls’ wilder’d, frenzied roll,"

633,VI.,"Admittance granted, from his breast he drew"

637,VI.,"But, as he read, his varying hue exprest"
638,VI.,That Fury’s tortures rack’d his raging breast;--
639,VI.,Knit were his sable brows--his flashing eye
640,VI.,Shone like some orbit in a clouded sky;--
641,VI.,"Fierce tow’rd his giant form, his hand of war"
642,VI.,Stretch’d down to grasp his pond’rous scymitar;--
643,VI.,"His sounding voice was like the thunder’s roll,"

645,VI.,“’Tis well; the rebel boy shall rue the hour

647,VI.,"“Brav’d by a stripling! where is then this arm,"

651,VI.,"“No, never no! but hence--command Reylain"
652,VI.,“To draw our troops before high Tauris’ plain.”
653,VI.,"He ceas’d--but still his mutt’ring tongue, the fire"
654,VI.,"Which flash’d his eye, declar’d his inward ire."
655,VI.,"While deepest passions o’er his senses came,"
656,VI.,"The monarch’s musing, and the hero’s flame,                      300"

662,VII.,
663,VII.,"His fav’rite slave approach’d, the salem made,"
664,VII.,And some low words in whisp’ring accent said--
665,VII.,"“’Tis right, them instant to our presence bring,”"
666,VII.,With hasty tone replied the haughty king.
667,VII.,"The doors of polish’d cedar open flew,"
668,VII.,And gave a warrior legion to the view;
669,VII.,"While, in the midst, fast bound in iron bands,"
670,VII.,"A warlike youth, with scorn indignant, stands:                   310"
671,VII.,"The simply-splendid garments that he wore,"
672,VII.,"Some blast of battle-storm had lately tore,"
673,VII.,And the rich gold blush’d deep in harden’d gore;
674,VII.,"Yet his bright face and form divine, where love"

676,VII.,"Seem’d ’mid soil’d garb and fett’ring chains t’ exclaim,"
677,VII.,“Behold a son of Conquest and of Fame.”

679,VII.,"He that had seen his eye of azure fair,"
680,VII.,"(Tint in those darkly-glowing climes so rare,)"
681,VII.,"And the soft cygnet down, that now began                         320"
682,VII.,"His cheek to blossom, and to promise man,"
683,VII.,And a sweet something o’er it spread--might trace
684,VII.,A woman’s softness in that god-like face.
685,VII.,"But, had he seen the almost burning flame"
686,VII.,"That o’er his eye, when rous’d by wrath or fame,"
687,VII.,"Flash’d (like the lightning hurl’d from heav’nly arm,"
688,VII.,"When hush’d each wind, on ocean’s azure calm),"
689,VII.,"And, with a blaze that pierc’d the bosom’s core,"
690,VII.,Made it still fiercer from the peace before:
691,VII.,"And, had he mark’d the form, the tow’ring crest,                 330"

695,VII.,As glares some lion on his num’rous foe;
696,VII.,So here and there bright flash’d his eye-ball’s glow:
697,VII.,"Upon the guards who held him, first it beam’d;"
698,VII.,Then to the Sultan’s lofty form it gleam’d:

701,VII.,"Then, turning to the guards,--“Ye’ve speeded well,"
702,VII.,"“Where met ye this young warrior?--Sadi, tell.”--"
703,VII.,"With lowly salem, the time-serving man,"
704,VII.,"Pimp to his master’s vices, thus began:--"

719,VIII.,"“No answer made he!--spurr’d his Arab horse,"
720,VIII.,“Bar’d his keen blade!--on us his driving course
721,VIII.,"“He dash’d impetuous;--we around him close,"
722,VIII.,“And pour on every side an iron show’r of blows.
723,VIII.,"“But he, his flashing sabre sweeping round,"
724,VIII.,“Roll’d four brave Moslems on the verdant ground:
725,VIII.,"“Then broke his weapon; or, perchance, his might"

727,VIII.,
728,VIII.,"“Then, as on some fair tree descends the storm,"
729,VIII.,“So rush’d our valiant soldiers on his form.
730,VIII.,"“But, when life hung upon that slender thread,"
731,VIII.,“I rear’d my sabre o’er his fenceless head:
732,VIII.,"“For I admir’d his courage, and I thought,"
733,VIII.,"“If thus for Ismael he so bravely fought,"
734,VIII.,"“His martial prowess, and his weighty hand,"
735,VIII.,“Might prove some succour to our Sultan’s band.”

1002,IV.,"As flash’d his weapon forth, and through the head"
1003,IV.,"Of Abbas, down e’en to the mouth it sped."
1004,IV.,He fell:--o’er Ismael’s eye th’ expression came
1005,IV.,"Of pitying softness, conq’ring wrathful flame:                   180"
1006,IV.,"He dropt the blade,--he sigh’d,--for he could glow"

1117,VI.,"’Till, as the news gain’d ground, the clamours rise,"
1118,VI.,And “Ismael! Ismael!” rend the list’ning skies.                  280
1119,VI.,"Some fling the high gates open--some loud cry,"
1120,VI.,“Perish the proud Alvante;” while they fly
1121,VI.,"To seek the palace, and the court to force,"
1122,VI.,"And send th’ usurper on his long, last course."
1123,VI.,
1124,VI.,"The gen’ral shouts, the long and deaf’ning din,"
1125,VI.,"Alvante heard, his stately halls within:"
1126,VI.,He started up in wonder and alarm;
1127,VI.,The flashing sabre found his giant arm.
1128,VI.,"“Hark! hark! methought I heard that hated name,"
1129,VI.,"“What, is it Ismael?--hark! again--the same.”                    290"
1130,VI.,"Then his friend Muly rush’d within that room,"
1131,VI.,"Trembling his form, and pale as cygnet’s plume"
1132,VI.,"His vet’ran cheek:--‘Fly, fly, ere yet too late,"
1133,VI.,‘The clam’rous throng are at the palace gate;
1134,VI.,"‘Thine head they swear’--(hark, hark, again that roar!)--"
1135,VI.,‘Shall pay for all the streams of kindred gore
1136,VI.,‘Thou’st caus’d to flow; in vain we’ve tried t’assuag

1138,VI.,"‘They cry that Ismael’s bands are sweeping now,"
1139,VI.,"‘In swift procession, o’er yon mountain’s brow.                  300"
1140,VI.,"‘O fly, O fly to shield thy regal form,"
1141,VI.,"’Till lull’d the beating dangers of the storm,--"
1142,VI.,"‘Haste to Armenia, that e’er loyal land"
1143,VI.,‘Will yield my sultan many a mighty band;
1144,VI.,"‘Haste, haste, O haste!’--“And whither should I fly?"
1145,VI.,“Here in his courts must king Alvante die;
1146,VI.,"“King am I now, and Death will lose his sting,"
1147,VI.,"“E’en ’mid his grasp, to think I die a king.”"
1148,VI.,"‘And think’st thou, if thou tarriest here, thy fate"
1149,VI.,‘Will be in all the royalty of state?                            310

1154,VI.,"‘This door will lead us hence,--away, away,"
1155,VI.,"‘Lost is your life, your kingdom, if you stay!"
1156,VI.,"‘But hold!--I have it!--cast these garments on,"
1157,VI.,"‘Muffle your face, and mingle with the throng;"

1161,VI.,"A natural wish his life, his realms to save,"
1162,VI.,"Alvante felt. If tarrying here, he knew"
1163,VI.,"That he must die, and die ignobly too."
1164,VI.,"If for awhile he went, Armenia might,"
1165,VI.,"By fortune aided, place him in his right."
1166,VI.,
1167,VI.,He instinctively clasp’d the muffling vest
1168,VI.,"In many a fold around his face and breast,"
1169,VI.,"And both are now disguis’d! one moment more,"
1170,VI.,"And they have past yon gold-enamell’d door,                      330"
1171,VI.,"And mingled with the throng--and to the sky,"
1172,VI.,"Now, they have join’d the gen’ral clam’rous cry."
1173,VI.,A leader mark’d their garb--their mien--their tone--
1174,VI.,Again he turn’d to view them--they are gone.

1197,VII.,"And that great warrior, cast in Beauty’s mould,"
1198,VII.,Blaz’d like a god-head in his arms of gold.
1199,VII.,"From hill, from vale, around, and from afar,"
1200,VII.,Roll’d the loud music of tremendous war;
1201,VII.,"The awful gong, the trumpet’s brazen tone,"
1202,VII.,"And the rough thunder of the tymbalon,"
1203,VII.,"The rude, yet rousing clashings of the zel,"
1204,VII.,The hollow blast of Süankos’ shell.
1205,VII.,"While, like some meteor rising here and there,"
1206,VII.,"The wide, bright banners wanton’d in the air.                    360"
1207,VII.,"Thus, while their welcome path, on every side,"
1208,VII.,"All Tauris hails, full royally they ride;"
1209,VII.,"And, ’mid the clamours of th’ admiring crowd,"
1210,VII.,That hail th’ auspicious march; yon palace proud

1239,VIII.,"’Twere strange to mark their meeting, how they came,"
1240,VIII.,Souls fierce as sparkles in the rising flame.                    390
1241,VIII.,How loth to speak the first: each eye-ball’s swell
1242,VIII.,"Beam’d on the earth, where scarce it e’er had fell"

1247,VIII.,"And even now they half-reluctant go,"

1249,VIII.,"To wage a mutual war.--They part awhile,"
1250,VIII.,"Moratcham hast’ning to Assyria’s soil,                           400"
1251,VIII.,"Fresh troops to raise; while to Armenia’s skies,"
1252,VIII.,"In warlike pride, Alvante’s banners rise,"
1253,VIII.,"And numbers daily to those banners came,"

1255,VIII.,
1256,VIII.,"Meantime young Ismael hears the dread alarms,"
1257,VIII.,Of his great enemy’s increasing arms.
1258,VIII.,Again his standard on the breezes burst;
1259,VIII.,"Again his bands, in ancient victories nurst,"
1260,VIII.,"He wakes; and, as the Simoom’s fiery breath,"
1261,VIII.,That wafts the kiss of pestilential death;                       410

1278,VIII.,"And hark, that crash!--The mingling hosts engage,"
1279,VIII.,"Blood streams, and armour clangs, and all is war and rage;"
1280,VIII.,"Man combats man, on hero hero dies,"
1281,VIII.,"Glares sword on sword, and ring the battle cries."
1282,VIII.,"High in the air the hov’ring vultures soar,"

1284,VIII.,"On the shock’d earth the slaughter’d numbers roll,"
1285,VIII.,And glory burns in every warrior’s soul;
1286,VIII.,"The battle-fields, like cauldrons, fiercely boil,"
1287,VIII.,And Azrail claps his iron wings and claims the soil.
1288,VIII.,"Tremendous is that scene of carnage fell,"
1289,VIII.,No mortal tongue its horrors e’er can tell!
1290,VIII.,
1291,VIII.,"As, when on some thick forest’s lofty head,"
1292,VIII.,"From high, some fierce autumnal blast is sped,"
1293,VIII.,"Drives through the leafy throng its rabid way,"
1294,VIII.,And shakes their thousand branches with dismay;                  440
1295,VIII.,"The leaves, the boughs, the trees themselves around"
1296,VIII.,"Are swept away, and scatter’d on the ground:"
1297,VIII.,"So stern Alvante, with resistless might,"
1298,VIII.,Cleaves his red pathway through the groves of fight.
1299,VIII.,"War-loving Azrail, Death’s tremendous lord,"
1300,VIII.,"Frowns on his crest, and hovers on his sword."
1301,VIII.,"Bath’d in red streams of hostile gore, where’er"
1302,VIII.,"Tow’rs his proud form, confusion wild is there."
1303,VIII.,
1304,VIII.,"His bands scarce think him mortal, and, inspir’d"

1306,VIII.,"Their swelling breasts; and, like the billowy deep,"
1307,VIII.,Fierce (led by him) against the foe they sweep.
1308,VIII.,"They thin the hostile ranks, who, in dismay,"
1309,VIII.,"In more than fear, half-routed, yield them way."
1310,VIII.,"Then, in that moment, when Alvante’s eye"
1311,VIII.,Saw the bright beams of coming victory;
1312,VIII.,"When, in idea, his hand has grasp’d again"
1313,VIII.,"With raptur’d joy, the throne of Iran: then,"
1314,VIII.,"Then, in that moment of eventful strife,"
1315,VIII.,"Worth a whole age of common, passive life;                       460"
1316,VIII.,"Before Alvante’s way, at headlong speed,"
1317,VIII.,A youthful chief has spurr’d his snowy steed.
1318,VIII.,"Each combatant has rous’d him from the fight,"
1319,VIII.,Awhile to gaze on that high form of might.
1320,VIII.,"But Iran’s genius, as aloft she flew,"
1321,VIII.,"Hung back, and trembled at the dangerous view:"
1322,VIII.,"For, in that god-like youth, she marks too well"
1323,VIII.,"Her last, lone hope, her favour’d Ismael."
1324,VIII.,"‘Come on,’ he cries, ‘proud tyrant; come, and know"
1325,VIII.,‘That thou wilt combat with no vulgar foe;                       470

1329,VIII.,"“’Tis Ismael, chief, who wooes thee to the fight!’"
1330,VIII.,"Alvante answered not, but in the flame"
1331,VIII.,"That flash’d his brow, and glar’d his eye-balls, came"
1332,VIII.,"A dreadful something, eager to destroy,"
1333,VIII.,"An horrid energy, a demon joy."
1334,VIII.,"So high he rear’d his blade, it seem’d that fate"
1335,VIII.,Upon one blow from that dread arm would wait.                    480
1336,VIII.,"But Ismael’s courser, practis’d in the war,"
1337,VIII.,"Swerv’d, and the sabre cut the yielding air."
1338,VIII.,"Not so did Ismael’s blade, though broke its force,"
1339,VIII.,"Through the steel corselet it has ta’en its course,"
1340,VIII.,And gash’d full sore:--and now the strokes so fast
1341,VIII.,"From either arm, to either form are past,"
1342,VIII.,"That scarce the eye-ball’s searching glance can know,"
1343,VIII.,"Where giv’n, where parried, or receiv’d the blow;"
1344,VIII.,"Save by the sparks that from their armour flash’d,"
1345,VIII.,"Save by the gore, that from the corselets gash’d,                490"
1346,VIII.,Pour’d in long streams; the drops upon the plain
1347,VIII.,"Fell from their brows, like pattering of rain:"
1348,VIII.,"And every stroke was aim’d full strong and true,"
1349,VIII.,"For each great chieftain ’mid the combat knew,"
1350,VIII.,"That all the war was on a single hand,"
1351,VIII.,That Iran’s empire hung upon his brand.
1352,VIII.,
1353,VIII.,"A foe so dread, Alvante never yet"
1354,VIII.,In conflict’s thickest walks of heroes met;
1355,VIII.,"And ne’er had Ismael, mid th’ embattled throng,"
1356,VIII.,"Known eye so keen, and arm so swift and strong.                  500"
1357,VIII.,"Each stroke, that like the flash of lightning past,"
1358,VIII.,"Seem’d fiercer, heavier, mightier than the last;"
1359,VIII.,"Till Ismael felt his youthful arm at length,"
1360,VIII.,"Weaken its blows, and slacken in its strength;"
1361,VIII.,"While stern Alvante, like some massy tow’r,"
1362,VIII.,Still seem’d to combat with the prime of pow’r:
1363,VIII.,"But Ismael hop’d one blow, that should contain"
1364,VIII.,"All his remaining strength, should smite him on the plain."
1365,VIII.,
1366,VIII.,"He nerv’d his arm, he rear’d it high in air,"
1367,VIII.,Then downwards drove the pondrous scymitar;                      510
1368,VIII.,"Alvante’s sword receiv’d that dreadful stroke,--"
1369,VIII.,"And Ismael’s treach’rous blade snapp’d short, and broke."
1370,VIII.,
1371,VIII.,Over Alvante’s face appear’d to play
1372,VIII.,"A wild ecstatic joy, a dreadful ray;"
1373,VIII.,And o’er his eye’s dark field of fierceness flew
1374,VIII.,"A something, O! too horrible to view!"
1375,VIII.,"“Now, now thine hour is come,” he inly said,"
1376,VIII.,"And high in air, he rear’d his shining blade."
1377,VIII.,
1378,VIII.,"Then Persia’s Genius, as she soar’d on high,"
1379,VIII.,"Trembled with fear, at Ismael’s death so nigh.                   520"
1380,VIII.,"Among the darts, that cleave the airy tides,"
1381,VIII.,"She singles one, and to Alvante guides:"
1382,VIII.,"Then in that moment, through his bending head,"
1383,VIII.,"When thund’ring down his massy blade, it sped."
1384,VIII.,"Th’ exulting speech has fainted from his tongue,"
1385,VIII.,From his numb’d hand down dropt the sword and rung
1386,VIII.,"Useless on earth; the swarthy colour flies,"
1387,VIII.,"The field recedes upon his glazing eyes,"
1388,VIII.,And Azrail’s cold tremendous shades around him rise.
1389,VIII.,"He fell! still Ismael held his stifled breath,                   530"
1390,VIII.,Still waiting for the dire approach of death;
1391,VIII.,"And, though he saw him fall, yet still he deem’d"
1392,VIII.,"’Twas not reality, but that he dream’d."
1393,VIII.,"At length he thought the coming stroke of fate,"
1394,VIII.,"From fierce Alvante, linger’d long and late:"
1395,VIII.,"He lifts his eyes--he sees him not--again,"
1396,VIII.,"Surpris’d, he drops them on the purple plain,"
1397,VIII.,And there he views him!--Oh! how chang’d his state!
1398,VIII.,"That arm, so dread--how cold, inanimate!"
1399,VIII.,"Then, then he felt it all! then, then it came                    540"
1400,VIII.,"Swiftly upon him, like the glance of flame:"
1401,VIII.,"He bent his body o’er his steed, his hand"
1402,VIII.,"Seiz’d from the earth, his enemy’s red brand;"
1403,VIII.,"Then lifts his voice, and dashes mid the crowd,"
1404,VIII.,"‘Alla! il Alla!’ shouting, long and loud."
1405,VIII.,New strength has nerv’d his weaken’d arm; where’er
1406,VIII.,"It rises, death and destiny are there."
1407,VIII.,"His troops have caught his fire, and to the heav’n,"
1408,VIII.,‘Alla! il Alla! and his Ismael!’ ‘s given.

1501,ON CANTO I.,"For the better understanding of several passages in this Poem, I will"
1502,ON CANTO I.,"here subjoin a short account of the claims of my hero, Ismael, to the"
1503,ON CANTO I.,"throne of Persia, and a brief history of his life."
1504,ON CANTO I.,
1505,ON CANTO I.,"Usum Cassan, king of Persia, gave his daughter, Martha, in marriage to"
1506,ON CANTO I.,"Shich-Eidar, a certain sage, famous for a new sect of religion, and for"
1507,ON CANTO I.,extraordinary piety and virtue.
1508,ON CANTO I.,
1509,ON CANTO I.,"At Usum Cassan’s death, he was succeeded by his son Jacup, but he being"
1510,ON CANTO I.,"murdered by his wife, Julaver, a man of high rank, and a distant"
1511,ON CANTO I.,"relation to him, seized the throne, and dying, after three years, was"
1512,ON CANTO I.,"succeeded by Baysinger, and at his death, the crown came to a young"
1513,ON CANTO I.,nobleman named Rustam.
1514,ON CANTO I.,
1515,ON CANTO I.,Though no one had a better (nor indeed so good a) right to the kingdom
1516,ON CANTO I.,"of Persia as Shich-Eidar, on account of his marriage with Usum Cassan’s"
1517,ON CANTO I.,"daughter, yet his birth being inferior to those who had hitherto"
1518,ON CANTO I.,"reigned, and being so entirely absorbed in the care of religion, and the"
1519,ON CANTO I.,"sweets of retirement; during the sway of the three preceding kings,"
1520,ON CANTO I.,"there was not even any mention of him, or his pretensions. But Rustam"
1521,ON CANTO I.,"was alarmed at the numbers who daily flocked to Shich-Eidar, to embrace"
1522,ON CANTO I.,"his religious principles, and he was afraid of the reverence which the"
1523,ON CANTO I.,"Persians paid to his high virtues and brilliant talents, and of their"
1524,ON CANTO I.,secret attachment to the race of Usum Cassan; he therefore resolved to
1525,ON CANTO I.,"rid himself of so formidable an object for his fears, and employed"
1526,ON CANTO I.,"assassins, who murdered the unfortunate sage at his residence in"
1527,ON CANTO I.,"Ardevil. But Rustam was afterwards slain in his turn by Achmet, who is"
1528,ON CANTO I.,"said _to have been favoured by the king’s own mother, and aided by her"
1529,ON CANTO I.,in the death of her son_.
1530,ON CANTO I.,
1531,ON CANTO I.,"The murderer seized the crown, but enjoyed it only six months, when"
1532,ON CANTO I.,"Carabes, one of Rustam’s ancient officers, collecting a considerable"
1533,ON CANTO I.,"body of soldiers, marched straight to Tauris, then the capital of"
1534,ON CANTO I.,"Persia, and surprising Achmet, who was in no condition to resist, put"
1535,ON CANTO I.,"him to death, by the most dreadful (though almost merited) tortures."
1536,ON CANTO I.,
1537,ON CANTO I.,"The throne being thus vacant, Alvante, a nobleman of high rank, was"
1538,ON CANTO I.,chosen to fill it.
1539,ON CANTO I.,
1540,ON CANTO I.,"Shich-Eidar left three sons, who would have shared the same fate as"
1541,ON CANTO I.,"their father, had they fallen into Rustam’s hands. The two eldest fled,"
1542,ON CANTO I.,"one to Asia Minor, the other to Aleppo, and the third, Ismael, then only"
1543,ON CANTO I.,"a child, was secretly conveyed, by his father’s friends, to Hyrcania or"
1544,ON CANTO I.,"Ghilan; where he was protected by Pyrchalim, a nobleman then in"
1545,ON CANTO I.,possession of several places on the Caspian Sea. Pyrchalim caused him to
1546,ON CANTO I.,"be reared in the religious tenets of Shich-Eidar, and the youth"
1547,ON CANTO I.,"perceiving that was the best way to acquire popular favour, of which he"
1548,ON CANTO I.,"had great need to support the just pretensions he had to the throne,"
1549,ON CANTO I.,"shewed a great zeal to observe, and to propagate, his paternal sect. As"
1550,ON CANTO I.,"he was possessed of great personal beauty, and inherited all the"
1551,ON CANTO I.,"splendid abilities of his father, combined with great courage and"
1552,ON CANTO I.,"eloquence, he was soon joined, not only by the common people, but also"
1553,ON CANTO I.,by many of high rank.
1554,ON CANTO I.,
1555,ON CANTO I.,"His first success in arms, was the regaining certain lands in Armenia,"
1556,ON CANTO I.,"which had been given his mother as her dowry, and afterwards being"
1557,ON CANTO I.,"reinforced by many of Shich-Eidar’s old disciples, he attacked the"
1558,ON CANTO I.,"castle of Mamurlac, and after having taken and plundered it, he led his"
1559,ON CANTO I.,"victorious army to Sumach, the capital of Mesopotamia, which he also"
1560,ON CANTO I.,"took, and gave the spoils to his soldiers. At the noise of these first"
1561,ON CANTO I.,"exploits, and at the immense booty acquired by those who followed his"
1562,ON CANTO I.,"standard, numbers daily flocked to him from all parts, and he soon found"
1563,ON CANTO I.,"himself at the head of a considerable army, with which he resolved to"
1564,ON CANTO I.,"march immediately to Tauris, where Alvante, lately placed upon the"
1565,ON CANTO I.,"throne, held his court. That monarch had but just recovered from the"
1566,ON CANTO I.,"fatigues and confusion of a civil war with Moratcham, his brother (or,"
1567,ON CANTO I.,"as some assert, his son), who disputed the crown with him, and having"
1568,ON CANTO I.,"lost an important battle, had fled from the Persian territories."
1569,ON CANTO I.,
1570,ON CANTO I.,"The severe persecutions which Alvante had exercised, after his victory,"
1571,ON CANTO I.,"upon several of the chiefs of Tauris, who had taken part with his"
1572,ON CANTO I.,"opponent, rendered his name odious, and presented Ismael with a very"
1573,ON CANTO I.,"fair opportunity, who no sooner came before the city, than the gates"
1574,ON CANTO I.,"were thrown open. Alvante, who suspected nothing of this irruption into"
1575,ON CANTO I.,"his capital, without troops, and aware of the hatred entertained against"
1576,ON CANTO I.,"him by the whole city, was obliged to fly (and as one author relates) in"
1577,ON CANTO I.,"disguise: and Ismael entered triumphantly into Tauris, without shedding"
1578,ON CANTO I.,"the least blood, except of a few of Alvante’s guards."
1579,ON CANTO I.,
1580,ON CANTO I.,In the mean time Moratcham had reconciled himself to his brother
1581,ON CANTO I.,"Alvante, for the purpose of repelling their common enemy, the former"
1582,ON CANTO I.,"hastened to Assyria to raise forces, and the latter was already at the"
1583,ON CANTO I.,"head of a large army in Armenia: there Ismael followed him, and"
1584,ON CANTO I.,"(preventing Moratcham’s joining his brother, which was their intention,)"
1585,ON CANTO I.,"defeated him in a battle, in which Alvante fell, bravely fighting at the"
1586,ON CANTO I.,"head of his troops. Moratcham, hearing of his brother’s fate, carried"
1587,ON CANTO I.,"his army towards Tauris, but Ismael intercepting him, totally routed and"
1588,ON CANTO I.,put him to flight.
1589,ON CANTO I.,
1590,ON CANTO I.,"After this, Ismael reigned gloriously for twenty-five years, and died in"
1591,ON CANTO I.,peaceable possession of one of the most powerful monarchies in the
1592,ON CANTO I.,"world, having verified the predictions of Shich-Eidar, who was a very"
1593,ON CANTO I.,"skilful astrologer, and who had foretold,--“That this “son of his should"
1594,ON CANTO I.,one day by his zeal and conquests “almost equal the glory of Mahomet
1595,ON CANTO I.,himself.”

1603,ON CANTO I.,successes made him so bold as to strike so adventurous a blow as
1604,ON CANTO I.,attacking Alvante in his own capital. It was the custom of those who
1605,ON CANTO I.,"inhabited the provinces, and who were too peaceably inclined to mix in"
1606,ON CANTO I.,"the intestine commotions that so often occur in the East, to remove"
1607,ON CANTO I.,"their families and effects as near the capital as possible, though this"
1608,ON CANTO I.,scheme must appear very injudicious to one who reflects that the chief
1609,ON CANTO I.,"city is generally the most harrassed, ultimately."

2547,PART II.,"Behold thy pallid, fainting bride!"
2548,PART II.,"She gasps for breath,--she strives to speak,--"
2549,PART II.,In vain her voice would silence break:

2562,PART II.,"But, sudden starting from his trance,"
2563,PART II.,He cast on her one piercing glance;

2566,PART II.,"And, torn by frenzy and dismay,"
2567,PART II.,"Clasp’d in his arms the lifeless clay,"
2568,PART II.,"And mourn’d the hopes of many a day,--"
2569,PART II.,In one dire moment snatch’d away!
2570,PART II.,"But lo! around the banner’d hall,"
2571,PART II.,"A sudden gloom appear’d to fall,                                 170"

2579,PART II.,The lofty tow’rs in terror shake;
2580,PART II.,"And Osmond’s feasters, here and there,"
2581,PART II.,Disperse in wild and wondering fear.                             180
2582,PART II.,"Then, where the madd’ning bridegroom lay,"
2583,PART II.,"A dark-blue flame was seen to play,"
2584,PART II.,"And, like a sylph, in lightning-storm,"

2586,PART II.,"But on her pale, majestic face,"
2587,PART II.,"A mix’d expression you might trace,"
2588,PART II.,"Of pride, of rage, triumphant joy;--"
2589,PART II.,A something seeking to destroy.
2590,PART II.,"One step to Osmond first she made,"
2591,PART II.,And thus with deep low tone she said:--                          190
2592,PART II.,"“Osmond, behold! arise! arise!"
2593,PART II.,"“On me, once more, direct thine eyes;"
2594,PART II.,"“She, whom with treach’ry’s perjur’d part,"
2595,PART II.,"“Thou left’st to cure a broken heart,"
2596,PART II.,"“Has liv’d to blast, base traitor, know,"

2602,PART II.,"She spoke;--and, as she mov’d away,"
2603,PART II.,"Laugh’d, like a demon o’er his prey."
2604,PART II.,
2605,PART II.,Fierce flash’d in Osmond’s eyes the fire
2606,PART II.,"Of vengeful rage, of deepest ire."
2607,PART II.,"Sprang from his place, his dirk he drew,"
2608,PART II.,And swift on Geraldine he flew;
2609,PART II.,"One single moment scarce was o’er,"
2610,PART II.,Ere that keen dirk was red with gore.
2611,PART II.,"She fell!--but, haughty e’en in death,"
2612,PART II.,"No groan, no sigh, consum’d her breath.                          210"
2613,PART II.,"But, though she sunk upon that ground,"
2614,PART II.,Never again her corpse was found:
2615,PART II.,"And, strange to say, I’ve heard the tale,"
2616,PART II.,"That, borne upon the passing gale,"
2617,PART II.,"Unearthly screams and voices ran,"
2618,PART II.,And sounds--far from the sounds of man!

2990,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Two well-known sons of rapture-raising song,"
2991,“PARNASSUS!”----,Now slowly swept the radiant fields along.
2992,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Heroic S----, whose Parnassian lays"
2993,“PARNASSUS!”----,Richly deserve Britannia’s laureate bays.
2994,“PARNASSUS!”----,"With this great vot’ry of Apollo’s name,"
2995,“PARNASSUS!”----,The pensive shade of hallow’d R---- came;                        130
2996,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Each melting line, that this soft poet sung,"

2998,“PARNASSUS!”----,"He, who has gain’d a fame for aye to last,"
2999,“PARNASSUS!”----,By singing of the Pleasures that are past.
3000,“PARNASSUS!”----,"While I did gaze on them, across the plain,"
3001,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Like summer vapours, swept a jovial train,"
3002,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Issuing from these, I caught th’ unmeaning note"
3003,“PARNASSUS!”----,Of senseless C----’s empty numbers float;
3004,“PARNASSUS!”----,"W---- was there, who follow’d Homer’s rule,"

3011,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Hiding whate’er beneath the veil might be,"
3012,“PARNASSUS!”----,With the dark mantle of futurity.
3013,“PARNASSUS!”----,"In vain, my searching eye-balls seek t’ explore"
3014,“PARNASSUS!”----,The hidden secrets of that mystic shore.
3015,“PARNASSUS!”----,
3016,“PARNASSUS!”----,"From time to time, a legion would emerge"
3017,“PARNASSUS!”----,From its dark region’s shade-encircled verge:                    150
3018,“PARNASSUS!”----,"But most, ere yet a few short stops were o’er,"
3019,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Fell to the earth, and were beheld no more!"
3020,“PARNASSUS!”----,"A few, indeed, a farther distance past;"
3021,“PARNASSUS!”----,"But, though they sunk not first, they sunk at last."
3022,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Yet, as _they_ fell, from forth the sable land,"
3023,“PARNASSUS!”----,"All careless of their fate, another band"
3024,“PARNASSUS!”----,"In swift succession issued forth, till they"
3025,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Soon, in their turn, sunk down the dangerous way."
3026,“PARNASSUS!”----,
3027,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Methought my feet with rash, unhallow’d tread,"
3028,“PARNASSUS!”----,"My longing eyes, to this dark region led;                        160"
3029,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Methought my hand already seiz’d the shroud,"
3030,“PARNASSUS!”----,That o’er it hung its canopy of cloud;--
3031,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Methought, mid those just rushing on to light,"
3032,“PARNASSUS!”----,"I view’d a form, with awful grandeur bright;"
3033,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Upon his beaming brows, in leaves of gold,"
3034,“PARNASSUS!”----,“Britannia’s greatest glory” was enroll’d!
3035,“PARNASSUS!”----,Scarce could I snatch a momentary trace
3036,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Of these high words, when, through the darksome place,"
3037,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Burst forth these accents, awful, loud, and drear,"
3038,“PARNASSUS!”----,"“Hold back, hold back, rash mortal, and forbear!”"
3039,“PARNASSUS!”----,
3040,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Scarce was it utter’d, ere the wondrous scene,                   171"
3041,“PARNASSUS!”----,"And those who fill’d it, were no longer seen;"
3042,“PARNASSUS!”----,"And, in the stead of that remember’d dream,"
3043,“PARNASSUS!”----,I view’d the waves that swell Brent’s shallow stream;
3044,“PARNASSUS!”----,"And heard the tinkling from the distant fold,"
3045,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Stead of the strains from many a lyre of gold,"
3046,“PARNASSUS!”----,"That e’en but now, had bound the melting soul,"
3047,“PARNASSUS!”----,"In thralls of heav’nly, but of vain control."
3048,“PARNASSUS!”----,The grateful spell is broke!--the treasur’d tone--
3049,“PARNASSUS!”----,"The hallow’d visions--yes, alas!--are flown!                     180"
3050,“PARNASSUS!”----,"And I must back to scenes of loathsome life,"
3051,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Pregnant with sorrow, and profuse with strife."
3052,“PARNASSUS!”----,
3053,“PARNASSUS!”----,Yes! though the hand of time has scarcely spread
3054,“PARNASSUS!”----,"His roseate wreath of youth around my head,"
3055,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Yet I have felt, how keen the piercing dart,"
3056,“PARNASSUS!”----,"That grief can give, to lacerate the heart.--"
3057,“PARNASSUS!”----,"Yes, I have felt, how full of care, alas!"
3058,“PARNASSUS!”----,The thorny paths that man is doom’d to pass.
3059,“PARNASSUS!”----,"But for a bright, and ofttimes cheering ray,"
3060,“PARNASSUS!”----,Athwart my dark and melancholy way;                              190
3061,“PARNASSUS!”----,"For many a soothing, many a raptur’d hour,"
3062,“PARNASSUS!”----,"I bless, my Muse, thy sweet celestial pow’r."
