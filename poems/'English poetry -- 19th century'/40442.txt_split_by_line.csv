47,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.
48,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,
49,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,
50,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Tennyson was no recluse. He shunned society in the ordinary London
51,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"sense, but he welcomed kindred spirits to his beautiful home, with"
52,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,large-hearted cordiality. To be acquainted with Farringford was in
53,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,itself a liberal education. Farringford was an ideal home for a great
54,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"poet. To begin with, it was somewhat secluded and remote from the"
55,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"world's ways, especially in the early 'fifties, when the Isle of Wight"
56,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,was much more of a _terra incognita_ than traffic now permits. One had
57,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"to travel down some hundred miles from town, cross from the quaint"
58,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,little New Forest port of Lymington to the still quainter little
59,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"old-world Yarmouth--""a mediæval Venice,"" the poet called it--and then"
60,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"drive some miles to Freshwater, before one attained the stately"
61,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,loveliness of Farringford embowered in trees.
62,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,
63,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"""Where, far from noise and smoke of town,"
64,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,I watch the twilight falling brown
65,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"All around a careless-ordered garden,"
66,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Close to the ridge of a noble down."""

75,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,_Lines to the Rev. F. D. Maurice._
76,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,
77,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,The interior of the house--a very ancient one--was no less ideal than
78,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"its outward aspect, ""it was like a charmed palace, with green walks"
79,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"without and speaking walls within."" And its occupants crowned all--the"
80,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"ethereally lovely mistress with her ""tender spiritual face,"" and the"
81,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"master, tall, broad-shouldered, and massive, dark-eyed and"
82,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"dark-browed, his voice full of deep organ-tones and delicate"

98,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,
99,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,
100,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Subject to slight inevitable variations, a certain method and routine"
101,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"governed the day of Tennyson. He had definite working-times, indoors"
102,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"and out, and accustomed habits of family life. The morning brought him"
103,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,letters from all parts of England: there was hardly any great man who
104,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,did not desire to exchange salutations and discuss world-subjects with
105,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"a thinker so far above the rest. The poet, with the prophetic soul of"
106,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"genius, had always been well in advance of his times."
107,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,
108,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"""For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,"
109,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;"
110,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,"
111,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales;"
112,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rained a ghastly dew"
113,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue;
114,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm,"
115,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,With the standards of the peoples plunging through the thunderstorm;
116,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Till the war-drum throbbed no longer, and the battle flags were"

123,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of
124,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,change.
125,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Thro' the shadow of the globe we sweep into the younger day;

129,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,
130,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,The daily papers are somewhat late in reaching the Isle of Wight: but
131,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,the poet could find inspiration even in a source so apparently prosaic
132,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,as a _Times_ column. He noted down some of those valiant and
133,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,soul-stirring episodes which go unrecorded save by a passing
134,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"paragraph: and the poem which, perhaps, has held the public fancy"
135,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"longest, the _Charge of the Light Brigade_, was written a few minutes"
136,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,after reading the _Times'_ description of the battle containing the
137,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"phrase ""Someone had blundered."""
138,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,
139,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"""Half a league, half a league,"
140,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Half a league onward,"

142,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Rode the six hundred.
143,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"'Forward, the Light Brigade!"
144,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Charge for the guns!' he said:

146,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Rode the six hundred.
147,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,
148,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"""'Forward, the Light Brigade!'"
149,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Was there a man dismay'd?
150,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Not tho' the soldier knew
151,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Someone had blunder'd:
152,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Their's not to make reply,"
153,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Their's not to reason why,"
154,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Their's but to do and die:

160,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Cannon in front of them
161,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Volley'd and thunder'd;
162,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Storm'd at with shot and shell,"
163,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Boldly they rode and well,"
164,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Into the jaws of Death,"
165,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Into the mouth of Hell
166,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Rode the six hundred.
167,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,
168,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"""Flash'd all their sabres bare,"
169,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Flash'd as they turned in air
170,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Sabring the gunners there.
171,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Charging an army, while"
172,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,All the world wonder'd;
173,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Plunged in the battery-smoke

175,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Cossack and Russian
176,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Reel'd from the sabre stroke
177,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Shatter'd and sunder'd.

186,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"While horse and hero fell,"
187,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,They that had fought so well
188,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Came thro' the jaws of Death,"
189,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Back thro' the mouth of Hell,"

193,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"""When can their glory fade?"
194,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"O, the wild charge they made!"
195,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,All the world wonder'd.

201,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,
202,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"A little while after breakfast, Tennyson would retire to his ""den"" on"
203,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"the top storey, for that ""sacred half-hour"" devoted to poetical"
204,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"composition, and assisted by his beloved pipe, during which nobody"
205,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"dared disturb him. This den, or study, formed a setting worthy of its"
206,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"inmate. Every inch of wall was covered with portrait, sketches,"
207,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,drawings. Almost every distinguished name of the nineteenth century
208,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,was in some manner represented here: the poet literally worked
209,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,surrounded by his friends. And in this congenial atmosphere he devoted
210,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"himself to that life-long pursuit of his, as he has imaged it in the"
211,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"""Gleam,"" which ""flying onward, wed to the melody, sang through the"
212,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"world."""

215,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,
216,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Whatever respective values a future generation may set upon Tennyson's
217,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"work, there can be little doubt that he himself considered the _Idylls"
218,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"of the King_, with its inner spiritual meanings, as his greatest work."
219,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"""There is no single fact or incident in the Idylls,"" he said, ""which"
220,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"cannot be explained without any mystery or allegory whatever."" Hence"
221,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"their appeal to the least mystical reader, through sheer beauty of"
222,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,language and superb pictorial effect. But at the same time he let it
223,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,be known that his whole story was inherently one of pure symbolism:
224,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,starting from the suggestion that Arthur represented conscience. This
225,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"idea is predominant, without undue insistence upon it, in _Guinevere_."

230,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"I did not come to curse thee, Guinevere,"
231,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"I, whose vast pity almost makes me die"
232,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"To see thee laying there thy golden head,"
233,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"My pride in happier summers, at my feet."

256,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Rang, coming, prone from off her seat she fell"

258,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,There with her milk-white arms and shadowy hair
259,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,She made her face a darkness from the King;
260,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,And in the darkness heard his armed feet
261,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Pause by her; then came silence, then a voice,"
262,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Monotonous and hollow like a ghost's,"

300,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,In the course of the day the poet would devote considerable time and
301,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,energy to his favourite exercise of garden work. To plant trees and
302,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"shrubs, to roll the lawn, to dig the kitchen garden, and lovingly to"
303,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"tend the simple flowers which he had set, was his constant delight as"
304,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"long as his strength sufficed. He had a passionate love, and an"
305,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,extraordinary knowledge of Nature: he rejoiced in watching the birds
306,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"in his great cedar, ilex and fir trees, and his mind was thoroughly"
307,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,attuned to the sweet influences of colour and foliage. Few else could

341,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"But the rose was awake all night for your sake,"
342,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,Knowing your promise to me;
343,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"The lilies and roses were all awake,"

365,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"when he put aside his gardening tools and started, as was his wont,"
366,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,for a stroll with some friend along the glorious cliffs of Freshwater.
367,A DAY WITH TENNYSON.,"Those were favoured folk, who, like Mrs. Thackeray Ritchie, ""walked"
