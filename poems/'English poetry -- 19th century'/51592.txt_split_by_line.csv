1429,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,
1430,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,There were two had died one day
1431,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,So they told me by the way;
1432,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"“One, ah well, poor soul,” they said,"
1433,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"“Better off that he is dead,"
1434,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Such a poor man!--but the other
1435,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,He was our good prefect’s brother;
1436,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Rich! And surely of great worth;--”
1437,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Both at one now--earth and earth!--
1438,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,“Half the town is deep in prayer;
1439,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Round him at our Lady’s there;
1440,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,But the poor man’s funeral
1441,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Is in the church outside the wall;
1442,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"Aye, our Lady’s nave is wide,"
1443,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Would you lay them side by side?”
1444,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,So I followed both these dead;--
1445,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"Where the poor man’s pall was spread,"
1446,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"Boarded in his box of deal,"
1447,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"There were only six to kneel,"
1448,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,And a priest that hurried through
1449,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Such quick office as would do.
1450,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"_Requiem æternam dona ei, Domine,"

1456,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"The rich curtains at the door,"
1457,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"And the purple velvet pall,"
1458,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"And the high catafalque o’er all,"
1459,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Where a hundred tapers glow
1460,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,On the same pale face of death below.--
1461,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"All the good town’s folk are there,"
1462,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Some to weep and some to stare;
1463,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"Little recks _he_ how ye weep,"
1464,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Very sound he lies asleep;
1465,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"Little recks _he_ how ye pray,"
1466,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,For his ears are sealed alway!
1467,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"Many a monk to thumb his beads,"
1468,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Chant his canticles and creeds;
1469,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Aye and here with quivering lips
1470,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,O’er his meagre finger-tips
1471,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"Prays the priest, and all the while"
1472,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Drones the deep organ thrill; and then
1473,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"Along the gloomy curtained aisle,"

1475,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"_Requiem æternam dona ei, Domine,"
1476,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Et lux perpetua luceat ei._
1477,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,
1478,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Now beyond the city wall
1479,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Winds his pomp of funeral;
1480,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Feebly do those tapers flare
1481,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"In the sunshine’s summer glare,"
1482,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Loud above their chanting swells
1483,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"The horror of the tolling bells,"
1484,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Tapers burn where light is needed
1485,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"For the living, not the dead!"
1486,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"Aye, and if your chants be heeded,"
1487,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,For the living be they said!
1488,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Where were all this folk who pray
1489,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,When the poor man passed this way?
1490,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,
1491,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"Long ago the spirit fled,"
1492,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"All of him that was of worth,"
1493,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,In his sojourning on earth;
1494,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"Wherefore o’er a body dead,"
1495,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Need long litanies be said?
1496,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,
1497,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Shall the jewelled cross he presses
1498,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"In those bony hands of his,"
1499,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"Aught avail, when death caresses"
1500,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,With his equal mouldering kiss?
1501,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Shall the rosary they twined
1502,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"Round and round his stiffened wrists,"
1503,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Hold his body sanctified
1504,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"From the worms, the socialists?"
1505,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,_Gaudea sempiterna possideat!_
1506,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,
1507,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,So the two that died one day
1508,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"Travelled down the selfsame way,"
1509,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,One in simple coffin board
1510,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"Painted cross along it scored,"
1511,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,One with all his high estate
1512,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"Graven on the silver plate,"
1513,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,All the pomp that he could save
1514,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"To adorn him in the grave,"
1515,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Lily wreaths of eucharis
1516,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"To cover those poor bones of his,"
1517,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"From the graveyard’s mouldy sod,--"
1518,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,But the poor man’s soul and this
1519,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Went the same way up to God!
1520,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"_In Paradisum deducant te angeli,"
1521,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Æternam habeas requiem!_
1522,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"By the sable shrouded door,"
1523,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,Of our Lady’s church once more!
1524,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"Softly came low music floating from above,"
1525,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,And a voice seemed to breathe its cadence through;
1526,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,"“Peace, peace! Lo this we did it of our love,"
1527,IN NOTRE DAME DE....,There was so little we could do!”

1792,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"And the fresh wind born of the sea grows faint with a sickly breath,"
1793,AT TIBER MOUTH.,As it stays in the fretting rushes and blows on the dews of death.

1796,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"No tree in the clefted ruin, no echo of song nor sound,"
1797,AT TIBER MOUTH.,But the dust of a world forgotten lay under the barren ground.
1798,AT TIBER MOUTH.,There are shrines under these green hillocks to the beautiful
1799,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"gods that sleep,"
1800,AT TIBER MOUTH.,Where they prayed in the stormy season for lives gone out on the deep;
1801,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"And here in the grave street sculptured, old record of loves and tears,"
1802,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"By the dust of the nameless slave, forgotten a thousand years."
1803,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"Not ever again at even shall ship sail in on the breeze,"
1804,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"Where the hulls of their gilded galleys came home from a hundred seas,"
1805,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"For the marsh plants grow in her haven, the marsh birds breed in her bay,"
1806,AT TIBER MOUTH.,And a mile to the shoreless westward the water has passed away.
1807,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"But the sea-folk gathering rushes come up from the windy shore,"
1808,AT TIBER MOUTH.,So the song that the years have silenced grows musical there once more;
1809,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"And now and again unburied, like some still voice from the dead,"

1811,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"But we went from the sorrowful city and wandered away at will,"
1812,AT TIBER MOUTH.,And thought of the breathing marble and the words that are music still.
1813,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"How full were their lives that laboured, in their fetterless"
1814,AT TIBER MOUTH.,strength and far
1815,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"From the ways that our feet have chosen as the sunlight is from the star,"
1816,AT TIBER MOUTH.,They clung to the chance and promise that once while the years are free
1817,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"Look over our life’s horizon as the sun looks over the sea,"
1818,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"But we wait for a day that dawns not, and cry for unclouded skies,"
1819,AT TIBER MOUTH.,And while we are deep in dreaming the light that was o’er us dies;
1820,AT TIBER MOUTH.,We know not what of the present we shall stretch out our hand to save
1821,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"Who sing of the life we long for, and not of the life we have;"

1824,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"They were strong, but the years are stronger; they are grown"
1825,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"but a name that thrills,"
1826,AT TIBER MOUTH.,And the wreck of their marble glory lies ghost-like over their hills.
1827,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"So a shadow fell o’er our dreaming for the weary heart of the past,"
1828,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"For the seed that the years have scattered, to reap so little at last."
1829,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"And we went to the sea-shore forest, through a long colonnade of pines,"
1830,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"Where the skies peep in and the sea, with a flitting of silver lines."
1831,AT TIBER MOUTH.,And we came on an open place in the green deep heart of the wood
1832,AT TIBER MOUTH.,Where I think in the years forgotten an altar of Faunus stood;
1833,AT TIBER MOUTH.,From a spring in the long dark grasses two rivulets rise and run
1834,AT TIBER MOUTH.,By the length of their sandy borders where the snake lies
1835,AT TIBER MOUTH.,coiled in the sun.
1836,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"And the stars of the white narcissus lie over the grass like snow,"
1837,AT TIBER MOUTH.,And beyond in the shadowy places the crimson cyclamens grow;
1838,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"Far up from their wave home yonder the sea-winds murmuring pass,"
1839,AT TIBER MOUTH.,The branches quiver and creak and the lizard starts in the grass.
1840,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"And we lay in the untrod moss and pillowed our cheeks with flowers,"
1841,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"While the sun went over our heads, and we took no count of the hours;"
1842,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"From the end of the waving branches and under the cloudless blue,"
1843,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"Like sunbeams chained for a banner, the thread-like gossamers flew."
1844,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"And the joy of the woods came o’er us, and we felt that our"
1845,AT TIBER MOUTH.,world was young
1846,AT TIBER MOUTH.,With the gladness of years unspent and the sorrow of life unsung.
1847,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"So we passed with a sound of singing along to the seaward way,"
1848,AT TIBER MOUTH.,Where the sails of the fishermen folk came homeward over the bay;
1849,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"For a cloud grew over the forest and darkened the sea-god’s shrine,"
1850,AT TIBER MOUTH.,And the hills of the silent city were only a ruby line.
1851,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"But the sun stood still on the waves as we passed from the fading shores,"
1852,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"And shone on our boat’s red bulwarks and the golden blades of the oars,"
1853,AT TIBER MOUTH.,And it seemed as we steered for the sunset that we passed
1854,AT TIBER MOUTH.,"through a twilight sea,"
1855,AT TIBER MOUTH.,From the gloom of a world forgotten to the light of a world to be.
