56,TO THE MUSE.,
57,TO THE MUSE.,"Thy whispers float upon the liquid air,"
58,TO THE MUSE.,"The sunbeams quiver by thy breath made quick,"
59,TO THE MUSE.,The myriad forest-branches thronging thick
60,TO THE MUSE.,"Thrill with delight thy mystic touch to bear,"
61,TO THE MUSE.,Like an enchanted harp to fingers fair
62,TO THE MUSE.,"Yielding a music that can soothe the sick,"
63,TO THE MUSE.,Or heal a heart that cruel pain doth prick;
64,TO THE MUSE.,Waters and winds thy living spirit share;
65,TO THE MUSE.,"Thy wrath is in the thunder, and thy tears"
66,TO THE MUSE.,Weep for man's dulness in melodious rain.
67,TO THE MUSE.,"Mistress, forgive me if on deafened ears,"
68,TO THE MUSE.,"Full of life's clamour and its harsh refrain,"

104,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,
105,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,[Greek: Ep êeroeidea ponton plazomenoi].
106,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,
107,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,
108,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Proudly the glad ships breast the buoyant wave,"
109,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Touched by the radiant fingers of the sun,"
110,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Exulting in the promise of dawn, and brave"
111,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Over the deep their unknown race to run,"
112,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,From nothingness that none remembereth
113,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,On to the undiscovered haven of death.
114,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,
115,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Out of the impenetrable night they drew,"
116,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Mist-curtained, moving darkly through the haze;"
117,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"And the East brightened and the breezes blew,"
118,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"And o'er life's widening waters now they gaze,"
119,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Greet the companions of their voyage, and know"
120,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,Some dim awakening purpose in them grow.
121,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,
122,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Lightly they sail beneath unclouded skies,"
123,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Effortless gliding on their easy way,"
124,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Till the winds gather and the wild floods rise,"
125,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"And tempests frown upon the forehead of day,"
126,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"And they that fared together lonelier drift,"
127,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,Sundered by driving storms and tides that shift.
128,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,
129,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Quenched are the beacon lights that brightly burned,"
130,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,Distant the guiding voices that were near;
131,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,The frolic temper of the prime is turned
132,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"To weariness, and faith is dimmed with fear:"
133,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"What if one battle against the beating waves,"
134,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,Who knows if he shall win the haven he craves?
135,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,
136,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Where lies the haven, or if there be in sooth"
137,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,Some haven of peace for them that wrestle and fight--
138,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Who shall be bold to take his trust for truth,"
139,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"The gleams he follows for the world's one light,"
140,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"When to his fellows' eyes as naught they seem,"
141,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,Or but false phantoms of a fading dream?
142,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,
143,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,This way or that on waves that rise and fall--
144,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,Falling and rising aimlessly they drive--
145,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Haply some flash of light, some far-off call"
146,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,Wakes them a little while to struggle and strive
147,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Onward with hope, until it fades again,"
148,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,And leaves them drifting on the dreary main.
149,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,
150,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Blindly the many drift, and drifting dream,--"
151,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Dream idle dreams, or waking scarce descry"
152,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,Aught but the froth and foam and fitful gleam
153,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,Of clashing cataracts as they thunder by:
154,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"They feel some short-lived passion in them glow,"
155,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,Or wondering watch the bubbles come and go.
156,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,
157,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,And here is one undauntedly that steers--
158,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Or there another--steadfast through the surge,"
159,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,Through storm and darkness. What is that which cheers
160,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,His spirit in danger? what beyond the verge
161,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,Of vision leads him on his perilous path?
162,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,Sure naught but God's own truth such following hath.
163,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,
164,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,Faint the gleams flicker through the earthborn cloud;
165,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,Trust thou and follow where they seem to lead;
166,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Soon will thy sight be clearer, and the shroud"
167,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Of night be shrivelled, and the day succeed:"
168,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,"Light may be stained or hidden, yet 'tis light;"
169,LIFE'S VOYAGE.,Trust thou and follow--'tis not of the night.

176,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',ON RE-READING 'RUTH.'
177,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',
178,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',
179,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',As one that in the sapless winter of life
180,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',Feels the benumbing touch of icy death
181,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Chill his warm pulses, and no more for strife"
182,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',Against the foe that ever followeth
183,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Finds the old fire within, or power, or breath,"
184,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',But knows that soon the eternal frost shall bind
185,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',These failing organs of his earthly mind:
186,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',
187,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',And looking backward through the misty years
188,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Beyond the harvest and the summer glow,"
189,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Into awakening life's fresh springtide, hears"
190,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Voices that rang around him long ago,--"
191,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Strange sweet dream-music that he seems to know,"
192,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',And dimly sees old faces that made bright
193,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',The days of childhood with love's softest light:
194,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',
195,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',Like one beneath the glimmering starlight treading
196,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Ways unfamiliar save in the full sun,"
197,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"He moves bewildered where remembrance, shedding"
198,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Faint fitful gleams, illumines one by one"
199,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Far-distant scenes where life was first begun,"
200,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Quick with light-hearted fancies and fresh hope,"
201,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',Fearless and steadfast with all foes to cope:
202,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',
203,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',And as he looks he wonders if indeed
204,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',That life beyond the years be truly his--
205,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"His those high-soaring hopes, that simple creed,"
206,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',That buoyant spirit: till some light that is
207,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',The lode-star of his life shines out in this
208,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Far-off child-world, some goal whereto his aim"
209,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',Has aye been set unchangingly the same.
210,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',
211,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',And so to eyes that through long-buried ages
212,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Look on that alien-seeming world, that glows"
213,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',Pictured in fire upon the sacred pages
214,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Where God his dealings with his children shows,--"
215,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"A larger life than our dwarfed spirit knows,--"
216,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',Man in the giant vigour of his prime
217,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',Looming heroic even through guilt and crime;
218,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',
219,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Creature in converse with Creator,--signs"
220,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Of power writ large in heaven and on the earth,--"
221,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',Pillar of cloud by day and fire that shines
222,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"In darkness,--plague and pestilence and dearth"
223,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"And deluge,--almost from our very birth"
224,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Familiar,--yet how strange and far away"
225,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',From all the fever of our little day.
226,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',
227,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Yet as we look on that mysterious story,"
228,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Scarce feeling kinship with that primal race,"
229,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',We that with sin have marred and dimmed the glory
230,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Of God's own presence manifest by grace,"
231,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Until he seems to hide afar his face,"
232,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',Find something in our deadened hearts that rings
233,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',Responsive to those far-off echoings.
234,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',
235,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Ours the old war with sin, the struggle of soul"
236,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"In passions' eddying waters, ours the choice"
237,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"To falter and fail, or battle towards the goal"
238,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Unyielding; and at times our hearts rejoice,"
239,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',When borne from out the distance comes a voice
240,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',Of brother-men that in the self-same strife
241,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',Have fought through weakness and have won their life.
242,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',
243,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"And more than all, when haply shines above"
244,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',The clouds and heavy mists of low desire
245,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"The perfect beauty of true human love,"
246,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"Beaconing through the darkness like a fire,"
247,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',And witnessing that hearts can yet aspire
248,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',"To kinship with the soul that shone in Ruth,"
249,ON RE-READING 'RUTH.',Of woman's faithfulness and woman's truth.

256,V.,[Greek: Epous smikrou charin].
257,V.,
258,V.,
259,V.,Her eyes shone bright as the luminous star
260,V.,"That breaks through the shadows of dusk from far,"
261,V.,"And the wavy tresses that floated and gleamed,"
262,V.,"Guarding her radiant temples, seemed"
263,V.,"As the faery fires that a vision enfold,"
264,V.,Or light as the tremulous flames of gold
265,V.,"That quiver and glance on the forehead of dawn,"
266,V.,When the curtains of night are backward drawn;
267,V.,And her smile was like to the rippling sea
268,V.,Greeting the beams of the sun with glee;
269,V.,"And her voice was the singing of springtide, heard"
270,V.,"In the orison chanted by soaring bird,"
271,V.,And in the breath of the soft west breeze
272,V.,"Wooing the buds of the wakened trees,"
273,V.,And in the music of fountains free
274,V.,At last from their icy slavery;
275,V.,And she moved with a step as light and glad
276,V.,As ever a nymph or a goddess had.
277,V.,Could mortal eyes on a form divine
278,V.,"Gaze for a moment, and then not pine"
279,V.,With passionate hunger for that sweet food
280,V.,Of the beauteous blossom of maidenhood?
281,V.,To feed for ever on that soft light
282,V.,"That conquered the gloom of the world's dark night,"
283,V.,And shed in its lustre a mystic sense
284,V.,Of soothing solace and joy intense?
285,V.,Could ears drink once of the silver flow
286,V.,"Of melody poured from her lips, nor know"
287,V.,"The thirst of a madman, rendering up"
288,V.,Life for the pleasure of one sweet cup?
289,V.,"Seeing and hearing, he scarce wist first"
290,V.,"What light on his sunless path had burst,"
291,V.,But he felt about him a wondrous glow
292,V.,"Flooding the field of his vision, so"
293,V.,"That the shadows shrank as in shame away,"
294,V.,And hope rekindled her flickering ray;
295,V.,And over his spirit seemed to flow
296,V.,"A quickening influence, even as though,"
297,V.,Out of the heavy and poisoned air
298,V.,"Of some dark city, a God might bear"
299,V.,"One that struggled with labouring breath,"
300,V.,"All but held in the grasp of death,"
301,V.,And might set him high on the aery brink
302,V.,"Of a loftily-bastioned Alp, to drink"
303,V.,The strength of the mountains--a stronger draught
304,V.,"Than ever of vintage fire was quaffed,"
305,V.,Coursing exultantly through and through
306,V.,"His veins, and giving him life anew."
307,V.,"So awhile he rejoiced, scarce heedful why,"
308,V.,And the days went sweetly and swiftly by;
309,V.,"Alas! too swiftly over and lost,"
310,V.,"Like blossoms of summer seared by the frost,"
311,V.,That feel more bitter the wintry spite
312,V.,Because of the fulness of past delight.
313,V.,"'Twas but a parting, and oft before"
314,V.,"Parting of friends, though his heart was sore,"
315,V.,Parting and loss he had known to bear--
316,V.,'Tis a lesson we learn from our cradle to share:
317,V.,"But a sudden anguish upon him fell,"
318,V.,"As upon one cast from heaven to hell,"
319,V.,For a moment showed what had lifted his life
320,V.,Out of the weary and sordid strife
321,V.,"Of men that struggle and die for gold,"
322,V.,And sell themselves as a chattel is sold.--
323,V.,"And lo! it was over, and life once more"
324,V.,Must sink to the depth where it groped before:
325,V.,"To part;--and it might be, never again"
326,V.,To know the joy of her presence; fain
327,V.,"Was his heart to utter its secret woe,"
328,V.,And all the strength of its love to show.
329,V.,Sure 'twas a strength that must prevail
330,V.,"To win the world, or the heavens to scale;"
331,V.,"High above earth she seemed, yet heaven"
332,V.,"Is mingled with earth by love's sweet leaven,"
333,V.,"And even the goddess of dawn, 'tis said,"
334,V.,Deignèd a mortal man to wed.
335,V.,Yet when he looked on the light divine
336,V.,"That seemed in those lustrous orbs to shine,"
337,V.,"His lips would falter, and pale shame froze"
338,V.,The fountain of love from his heart that rose:
339,V.,How could a spirit as free as air
340,V.,"Brook to be fettered, or stoop to share"
341,V.,An earthlier life from her range sublime?
342,V.,"Even the fancy he deemed a crime,--"
343,V.,As if one dreamt to win for his own
344,V.,The queen of night from her star-girt throne
345,V.,"And enjoy the light of the world alone,--"
346,V.,What if he spake could she feel or say?
347,V.,"Words of scorn? or of anger? Nay,"
348,V.,"Pity belike for a mind distraught,"
349,V.,That rashly to soar from its sphere had sought.
350,V.,Harder were pity to bear than scorn;
351,V.,Better to hide how his heart was torn:
352,V.,So might the thought of that sweet time be
353,V.,"Ever a cloudless memory,"
354,V.,As of a day that from break to close
355,V.,Never a film on its bright face shows.--
356,V.,"And so she was gone from his life, and left"
357,V.,"His heart of joy and of light bereft,"
358,V.,"And tenanted only by blank despair,"
359,V.,"That finds no longer the sunshine fair,"
360,V.,And knows no healing for its distress
361,V.,Except to pass into nothingness.
362,V.,"'Tis but a word and the tale is o'er,--"
363,V.,"And haply the like has chanced before,"
364,V.,"And it wants not this poor art of mine,--"
365,V.,For he sought as his sorrow's anodyne
366,V.,"The blood-red riot of war, to sate"
367,V.,All thought with the numbing opiate
368,V.,Of the frenzy of battle; and gave his life
369,V.,"As a prodigal gives, in an alien strife:"
370,V.,And under the shroud of the desert sand
371,V.,He lies at rest in a far-off land.
372,V.,And one there is that for many a year
373,V.,Hath mourned with many a secret tear;
374,V.,"And the light of her eyes is dimmed with care,"
375,V.,"And age has silvered her sunny hair,"
376,V.,And hollower rings the full rich flow
377,V.,Of her voice; and her step is weary and slow;
378,V.,"And little, I ween, is understood"
379,V.,The tale of her maiden-widowhood:
380,V.,"And naught of her trouble of soul she saith,"
381,V.,"But ever beyond the river of death,"
382,V.,"Soothed as she draws to its margin nigher,"
383,V.,She looks to the haven of her desire:
384,V.,And dimly her gaze through the mist descries
385,V.,"One that waiteth with earthward eyes,"
386,V.,Fired by a deathless love whose glow
387,V.,"Spoke to her heart long years ago,"
388,V.,When his lips were sealed and he thought her higher
389,V.,(Coward lips!) than he durst aspire;
390,V.,And when she hid in her woman's pride
391,V.,The love for which she had gladly died.
