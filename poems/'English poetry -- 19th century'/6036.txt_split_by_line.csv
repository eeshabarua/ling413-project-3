19,TO THE READER,
20,TO THE READER,The Translator has ventured to entitle a Lay of the Higher Law
21,TO THE READER,"the following composition, which aims at being in advance of its"
22,TO THE READER,time; and he has not feared the danger of collision with such
23,TO THE READER,unpleasant forms as the Higher Culture. The principles which
24,TO THE READER,justify the name are as follows:
25,TO THE READER,
26,TO THE READER,The Author asserts that Happiness and Misery are equally divided
27,TO THE READER,and distributed in the world.
28,TO THE READER,
29,TO THE READER,"He makes Self-cultivation, with due regard to others, the sole"
30,TO THE READER,and sufficient object of human life.
31,TO THE READER,
32,TO THE READER,"He suggests that the affections, the sympathies, and the divine"
33,TO THE READER,gift of Pity are mans highest enjoyments.
34,TO THE READER,
35,TO THE READER,"He advocates suspension of judgment, with a proper suspicion of"
36,TO THE READER,"Facts, the idlest of superstitions."
37,TO THE READER,
38,TO THE READER,"Finally, although destructive to appearance, he is essentially"
39,TO THE READER,reconstructive.

54,I,
55,I,
56,I,The hour is nigh; the waning Queen
57,I,walks forth to rule the later night;
58,I,"Crownd with the sparkle of a Star,"
59,I,and throned on orb of ashen light:
60,I,
61,I,The Wolf-tail* sweeps the paling East
62,I,"to leave a deeper gloom behind,"
63,I,"And Dawn uprears her shining head,"
64,I,sighing with semblance of a wind:
65,I,
66,I,* The false dawn.
67,I,
68,I,"The highlands catch yon Orient gleam,"
69,I,while purpling still the lowlands lie;
70,I,"And pearly mists, the morning-pride,"
71,I,soar incense-like to greet the sky.
72,I,
73,I,"The horses neigh, the camels groan,"
74,I,"the torches gleam, the cressets flare;"
75,I,"The town of canvas falls, and man"
76,I,with din and dint invadeth air:
77,I,
78,I,The Golden Gates swing right and left;
79,I,up springs the Sun with flamy brow;
80,I,The dew-cloud melts in gush of light;
81,I,brown Earth is bathed in morning-glow.
82,I,
83,I,"Slowly they wind athwart the wild,"
84,I,"and while young Day his anthem swells,"
85,I,Sad falls upon my yearning ear
86,I,the tinkling of the Camel-bells:
87,I,
88,I,"Oer fiery wastes and frozen wold,"
89,I,"oer horrid hill and gloomy glen,"
90,I,"The home of grisly beast and Ghoul,*"
91,I,"the haunts of wilder, grislier men;"
92,I,
93,I,* The Demon of the Desert.
94,I,
95,I,"With the brief gladness of the Palms,"
96,I,"that tower and sway oer seething plain,"
97,I,"Fraught with the thoughts of rustling shade,"
98,I,"and welling spring, and rushing rain;"
99,I,
100,I,"With the short solace of the ridge,"
101,I,"by gentle zephyrs played upon,"
102,I,Whose breezy head and bosky side
103,I,front seas of cooly celadon;
104,I,
105,I,"Tis theirs to pass with joy and hope,"
106,I,whose souls shall ever thrill and fill
107,I,"Dreams of the Birthplace and the Tomb,"
108,I,visions of Allahs Holy Hill.*
109,I,
110,I,"* Arafât, near Mecca."
111,I,
112,I,"But we? Another shift of scene,"
113,I,another pang to rack the heart;
114,I,Why meet we on the bridge of Time
115,I,to change one greeting and to part?
116,I,
117,I,"We meet to part; yet asks my sprite,"
118,I,Part we to meet? Ah! is it so?
119,I,"Mans fancy-made Omniscience knows,"
120,I,who made Omniscience nought can know.
121,I,
122,I,"Why must we meet, why must we part,"
123,I,"why must we bear this yoke of MUST,"
124,I,"Without our leave or askt or given,"
125,I,by tyrant Fate on victim thrust?
126,I,
127,I,"That Eve so gay, so bright, so glad,"
128,I,"this Morn so dim, and sad, and grey;"
129,I,Strange that lifes Registrar should write
130,I,"this day a day, that day a day!"
131,I,
132,I,"Mine eyes, my brain, my heart, are sad,"
133,I,sad is the very core of me;
134,I,"All wearies, changes, passes, ends;"
135,I,alas! the Birthdays injury!
136,I,
137,I,"Friends of my youth, a last adieu!"
138,I,haply some day we meet again;
139,I,Yet neer the self-same men shall meet;
140,I,the years shall make us other men:
141,I,
142,I,"The light of morn has grown to noon,"
143,I,"has paled with eve, and now farewell!"
144,I,"Go, vanish from my Life as dies"
145,I,the tinkling of the Camels bell.
146,I,
147,I,
148,I,
149,II,II
150,II,
151,II,
152,II,"In these drear wastes of sea-born land,"
153,II,"these wilds where none may dwell but He,"
154,II,"What visionary Pasts revive,"
155,II,what process of the Years we see:
156,II,
157,II,Gazing beyond the thin blue line
158,II,"that rims the far horizon-ring,"
159,II,"Our saddend sight why haunt these ghosts,"
160,II,whence do these spectral shadows spring?
161,II,
162,II,"What endless questions vex the thought,"
163,II,"of Whence and Whither, When and How?"
164,II,What fond and foolish strife to read
165,II,the Scripture writ on human brow;
166,II,
167,II,"As stand we percht on point of Time,"
168,II,"betwixt the two Eternities,"
169,II,Whose awful secrets gathering round
170,II,with black profound oppress our eyes.
171,II,
172,II,"This gloomy night, these grisly waves,"
173,II,these winds and whirlpools loud and dread:
174,II,What reck they of our wretched plight
175,II,who Safetys shore so lightly tread?
176,II,
177,II,"Thus quoth the Bard of Love and Wine,*"
178,II,whose dream of Heaven neer could rise
179,II,Beyond the brimming Kausar-cup
180,II,and Houris with the white-black eyes;
181,II,
182,II,* Hâfiz of Shirâz.
183,II,
184,II,Ah me! my race of threescore years
185,II,"is short, but long enough to pall"
186,II,"My sense with joyless joys as these,"
187,II,"with Love and Houris, Wine and all."
188,II,
189,II,Another boasts he would divorce
190,II,"old barren Reason from his bed,"
191,II,And wed the Vine-maid in her stead;
192,II,fools who believe a word he said!*
193,II,
194,II,"* Omar-i-Kayyâm, the tent-maker poet of Persia."
195,II,
196,II,And Dust thou art to dust returning.
197,II,neer was spoke of human soul
198,II,"The Soofi cries, tis well for him"
199,II,that hath such gift to ask its goal.
200,II,
201,II,"And this is all, for this were born"
202,II,to weep a little and to die!
203,II,So sings the shallow bard whose life
204,II,still labours at the letter I.
205,II,
206,II,"Ear never heard, Eye never saw"
207,II,the bliss of those who enter in
208,II,"My heavenly kingdom, Isâ said,"
209,II,who wailed our sorrows and our sin:
210,II,
211,II,Too much of words or yet too few!
212,II,What to thy Godhead easier than
213,II,One little glimpse of Paradise
214,II,to ope the eyes and ears of man?
215,II,
216,II,I am the Truth! I am the Truth!
217,II,we hear the God-drunk gnostic cry
218,II,The microcosm abides in ME;
219,II,Eternal Allahs nought but I!
220,II,
221,II,"Mansûr* was wise, but wiser they"
222,II,who smote him with the hurlèd stones;
223,II,"And, though his blood a witness bore,"
224,II,no wisdom-might could mend his bones.
225,II,
226,II,* A famous Mystic stoned for blasphemy.
227,II,
228,II,"Eat, drink, and sport; the rest of lifes"
229,II,"not worth a fillip, quoth the King;"
230,II,Methinks the saying saith too much:
231,II,the swine would say the selfsame thing!
232,II,
233,II,"Two-footed beasts that browse through life,"
234,II,"by Death to serve as soil designd,"
235,II,"Bow prone to Earth whereof they be,"
236,II,and there the proper pleasures find:
237,II,
238,II,"But you of finer, nobler, stuff,"
239,II,"ye, whom to Higher leads the High,"
240,II,What binds your hearts in common bond
241,II,with creatures of the stall and sty?
242,II,
243,II,In certain hope of Life-to-come
244,II,I journey through this shifting scene
245,II,The Zâhid* snarls and saunters down
246,II,his Vale of Tears with confident mien.
247,II,
248,II,* The Philister of respectable belief.
249,II,
250,II,"Wiser than Amrâns Son* art thou,"
251,II,"who kenst so well the world-to-be,"
252,II,"The Future when the Past is not,"
253,II,the Present merest dreamery;
254,II,
255,II,* Moses in the Koran.
256,II,
257,II,"What knowst thou, man, of Life? and yet,"
258,II,"forever twixt the womb, the grave,"
259,II,"Thou pratest of the Coming Life,"
260,II,of Heavn and Hell thou fain must rave.
261,II,
262,II,The world is old and thou art young;
263,II,the world is large and thou art small;
264,II,"Cease, atom of a moments span,"
265,II,To hold thyself an All-in-All!
266,II,
267,II,
268,II,
269,III.,III.
270,III.,
271,III.,
272,III.,"Fie, fie! you visionary things,"
273,III.,"ye motes that dance in sunny glow,"
274,III.,Who base and build Eternities
275,III.,on briefest moment here below;
276,III.,
277,III.,"Who pass through Life liked cagèd birds,"
278,III.,the captives of a despot will;
279,III.,"Still wondring How and When and Why,"
280,III.,"and Whence and Whither, wondring still;"
281,III.,
282,III.,Still wondring how the Marvel came
283,III.,because two coupling mammals chose
284,III.,"To slake the thirst of fleshly love,"
285,III.,and thus the Immortal Being rose;
286,III.,
287,III.,"Wondring the Babe with staring eyes,"
288,III.,"perforce compeld from night to day,"
289,III.,Gript in the giant grasp of Life
290,III.,like gale-born dust or wind-wrung spray;
291,III.,
292,III.,Who comes imbecile to the world
293,III.,"mid double danger, groans, and tears;"
294,III.,"The toy, the sport, the waif and stray"
295,III.,"of passions, error, wrath and fears;"
296,III.,
297,III.,"Who knows not Whence he came nor Why,"
298,III.,"who kens not Whither bound and When,"
299,III.,"Yet such is Allahs choicest gift,"
300,III.,the blessing dreamt by foolish men;
301,III.,
302,III.,Who step by step perforce returns
303,III.,"to couthless youth, wan, white and cold,"
304,III.,Lisping again his broken words
305,III.,till all the tale be fully told:
306,III.,
307,III.,"Wondring the Babe with quenchèd orbs,"
308,III.,"an oldster bowd by burthening years,"
309,III.,How scaped the skiff an hundred storms;
310,III.,how scaped the thread a thousand shears;
311,III.,
312,III.,"How coming to the Feast unbid,"
313,III.,he found the gorgeous table spread
314,III.,"With the fair-seeming Sodom-fruit,"
315,III.,with stones that bear the shape of bread:
316,III.,
317,III.,How Life was nought but ray of sun
318,III.,"that clove the darkness thick and blind,"
319,III.,"The ravings of the reckless storm,"
320,III.,the shrieking of the ravening wind;
321,III.,
322,III.,"How lovely visions guiled his sleep,"
323,III.,"aye fading with the break of morn,"
324,III.,"Till every sweet became a sour,"
325,III.,till every rose became a thorn;
326,III.,
327,III.,Till dust and ashes met his eyes
328,III.,wherever turned their saddened gaze;
329,III.,"The wrecks of joys and hopes and loves,"
330,III.,the rubbish of his wasted days;
331,III.,
332,III.,How every high heroic Thought
333,III.,"that longed to breathe empyrean air,"
334,III.,"Failed of its feathers, fell to earth,"
335,III.,and perisht of a sheer despair;
336,III.,
337,III.,"How, dowerd with heritage of brain,"
338,III.,"whose might has split the solar ray,"
339,III.,"His rest is grossest coarsest earth,"
340,III.,a crown of gold on brow of clay;
341,III.,
342,III.,"This House whose frame be flesh and bone,"
343,III.,"mortard with blood and faced with skin,"
344,III.,"The home of sickness, dolours, age;"
345,III.,"unclean without, impure within:"
346,III.,
347,III.,"Sans ray to cheer its inner gloom,"
348,III.,"the chambers haunted by the Ghost,"
349,III.,"Darkness his name, a cold dumb Shade"
350,III.,stronger than all the heavnly host.
351,III.,
352,III.,"This tube, an enigmatic pipe,"
353,III.,"whose end was laid before begun,"
354,III.,"That lengthens, broadens, shrinks and breaks;"
355,III.,"puzzle, machine, automaton;"
356,III.,
357,III.,The first of Pots the Potter made
358,III.,by Chrysorrhoas blue-green wave;*
359,III.,Methinks I see him smile to see
360,III.,what guerdon to the world he gave!
361,III.,
362,III.,"* The Abana, River of Damascus."
363,III.,
364,III.,"How Life is dim, unreal, vain,"
365,III.,like scenes that round the drunkard reel;
366,III.,How Being meaneth not to be;
367,III.,"to see and hear, smell, taste and feel."
368,III.,
369,III.,"A drop in Oceans boundless tide,"
370,III.,unfathomd waste of agony;
371,III.,Where millions live their horrid lives
372,III.,by making other millions die.
373,III.,
374,III.,How with a heart that would through love
375,III.,"to Universal Love aspire,"
376,III.,"Man woos infernal chance to smite,"
377,III.,as Minarets draw the Thunder-fire.
378,III.,
379,III.,"How Earth on Earth builds tower and wall,"
380,III.,to crumble at a touch of Time;
381,III.,How Earth on Earth from Shînar-plain
382,III.,the heights of Heaven fain would climb.
383,III.,
384,III.,"How short this Life, how long withal;"
385,III.,"how false its weal, how true its woes,"
386,III.,This fever-fit with paroxysms
387,III.,to mark its opening and its close.
388,III.,
389,III.,"Ah! gay the day with shine of sun,"
390,III.,"and bright the breeze, and blithe the throng"
391,III.,"Met on the River-bank to play,"
392,III.,"when I was young, when I was young:"
393,III.,
394,III.,Such general joy could never fade;
395,III.,and yet the chilling whisper came
396,III.,"One face had paled, one form had failed;"
397,III.,"had fled the bank, had swum the stream;"
398,III.,
399,III.,"Still revellers danced, and sang, and trod"
400,III.,"the hither bank of Times deep tide,"
401,III.,Still one by one they left and fared
402,III.,to the far misty thither side;
403,III.,
404,III.,And now the last hath slipt away
405,III.,"yon drear Death-desert to explore,"
406,III.,And now one Pilgrim worn and lorn
407,III.,still lingers on the lonely shore.
408,III.,
409,III.,"Yes, Life in youth-tide standeth still;"
410,III.,in manhood streameth soft and slow;
411,III.,"See, as it nears the abysmal goal"
412,III.,how fleet the waters flash and flow!
413,III.,
414,III.,And Deaths are twain; the Deaths we see
415,III.,drop like the leaves in windy Fall;
416,III.,"But ours, our own, are ruined worlds,"
417,III.,"a globe collapst, last end of all."
418,III.,
419,III.,"We live our lives with rogues and fools,"
420,III.,"dead and alive, alive and dead,"
421,III.,We die twixt one who feels the pulse
422,III.,and one who frets and clouds the head:
423,III.,
424,III.,"And,oh, the Pity!hardly conned"
425,III.,the lesson comes its fatal term;
426,III.,"Fate bids us bundle up our books,"
427,III.,and bear them bodily to the worm:
428,III.,
429,III.,Hardly we learn to wield the blade
430,III.,before the wrist grows stiff and old;
431,III.,Hardly we learn to ply the pen
432,III.,ere Thought and Fancy faint with cold.
433,III.,
434,III.,"Hardly we find the path of love,"
435,III.,"to sink the self, forget the I,"
436,III.,"When sad suspicion grips the heart,"
437,III.,"when Man, _the_ Man begins to die:"
438,III.,
439,III.,"Hardly we scale the wisdom-heights,"
440,III.,"and sight the Pisgah-scene around,"
441,III.,"And breathe the breath of heavenly air,"
442,III.,and hear the Spheres harmonious sound;
443,III.,
444,III.,When swift the Camel-rider spans
445,III.,"the howling waste, by Kismet sped,"
446,III.,And of his Magic Wand a wave
447,III.,hurries the quick to join the dead.*
448,III.,
449,III.,"* Death in Arabia rides a Camel, not a pale horse."
450,III.,
451,III.,"How sore the burden, strange the strife;"
452,III.,"how full of splendour, wonder, fear;"
453,III.,"Life, atom of that Infinite Space"
454,III.,that stretcheth twixt the Here and There.
455,III.,
456,III.,How Thought is impotent to divine
457,III.,"the secret which the gods defend,"
458,III.,"The Why of birth and life and death,"
459,III.,that Isis-veil no hand may rend.
460,III.,
461,III.,Eternal Morrows make our Day;
462,III.,our _Is_ is aye _to be_ till when
463,III.,"Night closes in; tis all a dream,"
464,III.,"and yet we die,and then and THEN?"
465,III.,
466,III.,"And still the Weaver plies his loom,"
467,III.,whose warp and woof is wretched Man
468,III.,"Weaving th unpatternd dark design,"
469,III.,so dark we doubt it owns a plan.
470,III.,
471,III.,"Dost not, O Maker, blush to hear,"
472,III.,"amid the storm of tears and blood,"
473,III.,"Man say Thy mercy made what is,"
474,III.,and saw the made and said twas good?
475,III.,
476,III.,The marvel is that man can smile
477,III.,dreaming his ghostly ghastly dream;-
478,III.,Better the heedless atomy
479,III.,that buzzes in the morning beam!
480,III.,
481,III.,O the dread pathos of our lives!
482,III.,"how durst thou, Allah, thus to play"
483,III.,"With Love, Affection, Friendship, all"
484,III.,that shows the god in mortal clay?
485,III.,
486,III.,But ah! what vaileth man to mourn;
487,III.,shall tears bring forth what smiles neer brought;
488,III.,Shall brooding breed a thought of joy?
489,III.,"Ah hush the sigh, forget the thought!"
490,III.,
491,III.,"Silence thine immemorial quest,"
492,III.,contain thy natures vain complaint
493,III.,"None heeds, none cares for thee or thine;"
494,III.,like thee how many came and went?
495,III.,
496,III.,"Cease, Man, to mourn, to weep, to wail;"
497,III.,enjoy thy shining hour of sun;
498,III.,"We dance along Deaths icy brink,"
499,III.,but is the dance less full of fun?
500,III.,
501,III.,
502,III.,
503,IV,IV
504,IV,
505,IV,
506,IV,What Truths hath gleaned that Sage consumed
507,IV,by many a moon that waxt and waned?
508,IV,What Prophet-strain be his to sing?
509,IV,What hath his old Experience gained?
510,IV,
511,IV,"There is no God, no man-made God;"
512,IV,"a bigger, stronger, crueller man;"
513,IV,"Black phantom of our baby-fears,"

1200,VIII,
1201,VIII,"You all are right, you all are wrong,"

1232,VIII,
1233,VIII,Enough to think such things may be:

1504,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Hâjî Abdû has been known to me for more years than I care to
1505,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","record. A native, it is believed, of Darâbghird in the Yezd"
1506,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Province, he always preferred to style himself El-Hichmakâni, a"
1507,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","facetious lackab or surname, meaning Of No-hall, Nowhere. He"
1508,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",had travelled far and wide with his eyes open; as appears by his
1509,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","couplets. To a natural facility, a knack of language learning,"
1510,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",he added a store of desultory various reading; scraps of Chinese
1511,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",and old Egyptian; of Hebrew and Syriac; of Sanskrit and Prakrit;
1512,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","of Slav, especially Lithuanian; of Latin and Greek, including"
1513,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Romaic; of Berber, the Nubian dialect, and of Zend and Akkadian,"
1514,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","besides Persian, his mother-tongue, and Arabic, the classic of"
1515,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",the schools. Nor was he ignorant of the -ologies and the
1516,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","triumphs of modern scientific discovery. Briefly, his memory was"
1517,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",well-stored; and he had every talent save that of using his
1518,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",talents.
1519,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1520,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","But no one thought that he wood the Muse, to speak in the"
1521,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",style of the last century. Even his intimates were ignorant of
1522,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","the fact that he had a skeleton in his cupboard, his Kasîdah or"
1523,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",distichs. He confided to me his secret when we last met in
1524,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Western IndiaI am purposely vague in specifying the place. When
1525,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",so doing he held in hand the long and hoary honours of his chin
1526,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","with the points toward me, as if to say with the Island-King:"
1527,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1528,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","There is a touch of Winter in my beard,"
1529,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",A sign the Gods will guard me from imprudence.
1530,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1531,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","And yet the piercing eye, clear as an onyx, seemed to protest"
1532,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",against the plea of age. The MS. was in the vilest Shikastah or
1533,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","running-hand; and, as I carried it off, the writer declined to"
1534,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",take the trouble of copying out his cacograph.
1535,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1536,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","We, his old friends, had long addressed Hâjî Abdû by the"
1537,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",sobriquet of _Nabbianâ_ (our Prophet); and the reader will see
1538,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","that the Pilgrim has, or believes he has, a message to deliver."
1539,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",He evidently aspires to preach a faith of his own; an Eastern
1540,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Version of Humanitarianism blended with the sceptical or, as we"
1541,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","now say, the scientific habit of mind. The religion, of which"
1542,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Fetishism, Hinduism and Heathendom; Judæism, Christianity and"
1543,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Islamism are mere fractions, may, methinks, be accepted by the"
1544,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Philosopher: it worships with single-minded devotion the Holy
1545,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Cause of Truth, of Truth for its own sake, not for the goods it"
1546,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",may bring; and this belief is equally acceptable to honest
1547,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","ignorance, and to the highest attainments in nature-study."
1548,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1549,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","With Confucius, the Hâjî cultivates what Strauss has called the"
1550,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",stern common-sense of mankind; while the reign of order is a
1551,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",paragraph of his Higher Law. He traces from its rudest
1552,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",beginnings the all but absolute universality of some perception
1553,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","by man, called Faith; that _sensus Numinis_ which, by"
1554,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","inheritance or communication, is now universal except in those"
1555,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",who force themselves to oppose it. And he evidently holds this
1556,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",general consent of mankind to be so far divine that it primarily
1557,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","discovered for itself, if it did not create, a divinity. He does"
1558,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","not cry with the Christ of Novalis, Children, you have no"
1559,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","father; and perhaps he would join Renan in exclaiming, _Un monde"
1560,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",sans Dieu est horrible!_
1561,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1562,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",But he recognises the incompatibility of the Infinite with the
1563,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Definite; of a Being who loves, who thinks, who hates; of an"
1564,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","_Actus purus_ who is called jealous, wrathful and revengeful,"
1565,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",with an Eternal that makes for righteousness. In the presence
1566,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","of the endless contradictions, which spring from the idea of a"
1567,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Personal Deity, with the Synthesis, the _Begriff_ of Providence,"
1568,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",our Agnostic takes refuge in the sentiment of an unknown and an
1569,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",unknowable. He objects to the countless variety of forms assumed
1570,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","by the perception of a _Causa Causans_ (a misnomer), and to that"
1571,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","intellectual adoption of general propositions, capable of"
1572,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","distinct statement but incapable of proofs, which we term Belief."
1573,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1574,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","He looks with impartial eye upon the endless variety of systems,"
1575,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","maintained with equal confidence and self-sufficiency, by men of"
1576,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",equal ability and honesty. He is weary of wandering over the
1577,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","world, and of finding every petty race wedded to its own"
1578,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",opinions; claiming the monopoly of Truth; holding all others to
1579,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","be in error, and raising disputes whose violence, acerbity and"
1580,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",virulence are in inverse ratio to the importance of the disputed
1581,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",matter. A peculiarly active and acute observation taught him that
1582,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","many of these jarring families, especially those of the same"
1583,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","blood, are par in the intellectual processes of perception and"
1584,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",reflection; that in the business of the visible working world
1585,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",they are confessedly by no means superior to one another; whereas
1586,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","in abstruse matters of mere Faith, not admitting direct and"
1587,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","sensual evidence, one in a hundred will claim to be right, and"
1588,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",immodestly charge the other ninety-nine with being wrong.
1589,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1590,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Thus he seeks to discover a system which will prove them all
1591,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","right, and all wrong; which will reconcile their differences;"
1592,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","will unite past creeds; will account for the present, and will"
1593,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",anticipate the future with a continuous and uninterrupted
1594,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","development; this, too, by a process, not negative and"
1595,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","distinctive, but, on the contrary, intensely positive and"
1596,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",constructive. I am not called upon to sit in the seat of
1597,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",judgment; but I may say that it would be singular if the attempt
1598,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","succeeded. Such a system would be all-comprehensive, because not"
1599,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","limited by space, time, or race; its principle would be extensive"
1600,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","as Matter itself, and, consequently, eternal. Meanwhile he"
1601,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","satisfies himself,the main point."
1602,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1603,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Students of metaphysics have of late years defined the abuse of
1604,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",their science as the morphology of common opinion. Contemporary
1605,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","investigators, they say, have been too much occupied with"
1606,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",introspection; their labors have become merely
1607,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","physiologico-biographical, and they have greatly neglected the"
1608,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","study of averages. For, says La Rochefoucauld, _Il est plus aisé"
1609,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",de connoître lhomme en général que de connoître un homme en
1610,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",particulier_; and on so wide a subject all views must be
1611,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",one-sided.
1612,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1613,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",But this is not the fashion of Easterns. They have still to treat
1614,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","great questions _ex analogiâ universi_, instead of _ex analogiâ"
1615,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","hominis_. They must learn the basis of sociology, the philosophic"
1616,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","conviction that mankind should be studied, not as a congeries of"
1617,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","individuals, but as an organic whole. Hence the _Zeitgeist_, or"
1618,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","historical evolution of the collective consciousness of the age,"
1619,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","despises the obsolete opinion that Society, the State, is bound"
1620,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","by the same moral duties as the simple citizen. Hence, too, it"
1621,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","holds that the spirit of man, being of equal and uniform"
1622,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","substance, doth usually suppose and feign in nature a greater"
1623,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",equality and uniformity than is in Truth.
1624,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1625,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Christianity and Islamism have been on their trial for the last
1626,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",eighteen and twelve centuries. They have been ardent in
1627,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","proselytizing, yet they embrace only one-tenth and one-twentieth"
1628,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",of the human race. Hâjî Abdû would account for the tardy and
1629,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",unsatisfactory progress of what their votaries call pure
1630,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","truths, by the innate imperfections of the same. Both propose a"
1631,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","reward for mere belief, and a penalty for simple unbelief;"
1632,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","rewards and punishments being, by the way, very disproportionate."
1633,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Thus they reduce everything to the scale of a somewhat unrefined
1634,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",egotism; and their demoralizing effects become clearer to every
1635,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",progressive age.
1636,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1637,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Hâjî Abdû seeks Truth only, truth as far as man, in the present"
1638,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","phase of his development, is able to comprehend it. He disdains"
1639,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","to associate utility, like Bacon (Nov. Org. I. Aph. 124), the"
1640,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","High Priest of the English Creed, _le gros bon sens_, with the"
1641,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",_lumen siccum ac purum notionum verarum_. He seems to see the
1642,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",injury inflicted upon the sum of thought by the _â posteriori_
1643,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","superstition, the worship of facts, and the deification of"
1644,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","synthesis. Lastly, came the reckless way in which Locke freed"
1645,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",philosophy from the incubus of innate ideas. Like Luther and the
1646,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","leaders of the great French Revolution, he broke with the Past;"
1647,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",and he threw overboard the whole cargo of human tradition. The
1648,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",result has been an immense movement of the mind which we love to
1649,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","call Progress, when it has often been retrograde; together with a"
1650,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",mighty development of egotism resulting from the pampered
1651,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",sentiment of personality.
1652,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1653,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",The Hâjî regrets the excessive importance attached to a possible
1654,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","future state: he looks upon this as a psychical stimulant, a day"
1655,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","dream, whose revulsion and reaction disorder waking life. The"
1656,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",condition may appear humble and prosaic to those exalted by the
1657,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","fumes of Fancy, by a spiritual dram-drinking, which, like the"
1658,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","physical, is the pursuit of an ideal happiness. But he is too"
1659,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",wise to affirm or to deny the existence of another world. For
1660,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","life beyond the grave there is no consensus of mankind, no"
1661,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Catholic opinion held _semper, et ubique, et ab omnibus_. The"
1662,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",intellectual faculties (perception and reflection) are mute upon
1663,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",the subject: they bear no testimony to facts; they show no proof.
1664,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Even the instinctive sense of our kind is here dumb. We may
1665,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","believe what we are taught: we can know nothing. He would,"
1666,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","therefore, cultivate that receptive mood which, marching under"
1667,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","the shadow of mighty events, leads to the highest of goals,the"
1668,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",development of Humanity. With him suspension of judgment is a
1669,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",system.
1670,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1671,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Man has done much during the sixty-eight centuries which
1672,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","represent his history. This assumes the first Egyptian Empire,"
1673,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","following the pre-historic, to begin with B. C. 5000, and to end"
1674,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","with B. C. 3249. It was the Old, as opposed to the Middle, the"
1675,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","New, and the Low: it contained the Dynasties from I. to X., and"
1676,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","it was the age of the Pyramids, at once simple, solid, and grand."
1677,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",When the praiser of the Past contends that modern civilization
1678,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","has improved in nothing upon Homer and Herodotus, he is apt to"
1679,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",forget that every schoolboy is a miracle of learning compared
1680,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","with the Cave-man and the palæolithic race. And, as the Past has"
1681,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","been, so shall the Future be."

1683,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","The Pilgrims view of life is that of the Soofi, with the usual"
1684,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","dash of Buddhistic pessimism. The profound sorrow of existence,"
1685,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","so often sung by the dreamy Eastern poet, has now passed into the"
1686,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","practical European mind. Even the light Frenchman murmurs,"

1771,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",of the weaker races. Earthquakes and cyclones ravage small areas;
1772,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","but the former builds up earth for mans habitation, and the"
1773,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",latter renders the atmosphere fit for him to breathe. Hence he
1774,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",echoes:

1776,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",The universal Cause

1778,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1779,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Ancillary to the churchmans immoral view of original sin is
1780,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",the unscientific theory that evil came into the world with Adam
1781,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",and his seed. Let us ask what was the state of our globe in the
1782,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","pre-Adamite days, when the tyrants of the Earth, the huge"
1783,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Saurians and other monsters, lived in perpetual strife, in a"
1784,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",destructiveness of which we have now only the feeblest examples?
1785,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","What is the actual state of the world of waters, where the only"
1786,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","object of life is death, where the Law of murder is the Law of"
1787,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Development?
1788,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1789,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Some will charge the Hâjî with irreverence, and hold him a"
1790,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",lieutenant of Satan who sits in the chair of pestilence. But he
1791,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","is not intentionally irreverent. Like men of far higher strain,"
1792,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","who deny divinely the divine, he speaks the things that others"
1793,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","think and hide. With the author of Supernatural Religion, he"
1794,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",holds that we gain infinitely more than we lose in abandoning
1795,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",belief in the reality of revelation; and he looks forward to the
1796,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","day when the old tyranny shall have been broken, and when the"
1797,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",anarchy of transition shall have passed away. But he is an
1798,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Eastern. When he repeats the Greeks Remember not to believe,"
1799,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","he means Strive to learn, to know, for right ideas lead to right"
1800,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",actions. Among the couplets not translated for this eclogue is:
1801,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1802,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Of all the safest ways of Life
1803,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","the safest way is still to doubt,"
1804,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Men win the future world with Faith,"
1805,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",the present world they win without.
1806,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1807,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",This is the Spaniards:
1808,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1809,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","De las cosas mas seguras, mas seguro es duvidar;"
1810,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1811,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",a typically modern sentiment of the Brazen Age of Science
1812,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",following the Golden Age of Sentiment. But the Pilgrim
1813,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",continues:
1814,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1815,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",The sages say: I tell thee no!
1816,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",with equal faith all Faiths receive;
1817,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","None more, none less, for Doubt is Death:"
1818,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",they live the most who most believe.
1819,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1820,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Here, again, is an oriental subtlety; a man who believes in"
1821,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",everything equally and generally may be said to believe in
1822,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",nothing. It is not a simple European view which makes honest
1823,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Doubt worth a dozen of the Creeds. And it is in direct opposition
1824,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",to the noted writer who holds that the man of simple faith is
1825,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",worth ninety-nine of those who hold only to the egotistic
1826,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",interests of their own individuality. This dark saying means (if
1827,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","it mean anything), that the so-called moral faculties of man,"
1828,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","fancy and ideality, must lord it over the perceptive and"
1829,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","reflective powers,a simple absurdity! It produced a"
1830,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Turricremata, alias Torquemada, who, shedding floods of honest"
1831,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","tears, caused his victims to be burnt alive; and an Anchieta, the"
1832,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Thaumaturgist of Brazil, who beheaded a converted heretic lest"
1833,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",the latter by lapse from grace lose his immortal soul.
1834,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1835,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","But this vein of speculation, which bigots brand as Doubt,"
1836,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Denial, and Destruction; this earnest religious scepticism; this"
1837,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","curious inquiry, Has the universal tradition any base of fact?;"
1838,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","this craving after the secrets and mysteries of the future, the"
1839,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","unseen, the unknown, is common to all races and to every age."
1840,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Even amongst the Romans, whose model man in Augustus day was"
1841,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Horace, the philosophic, the epicurean, we find Propertius"
1842,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",asking:

1847,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",To return: the Pilgrims doctrines upon the subject of conscience
1848,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",and repentance will startle those who do not follow his train of
1849,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",thought:
1850,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1851,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Never repent because thy will
1852,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",with will of Fate be not at one:
1853,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Think, an thou please, before thou dost,"
1854,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",but never rue the deed when done.
1855,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1856,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",This again is his modified fatalism. He would not accept the
1857,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",boisterous mode of cutting the Gordian-knot proposed by the noble
1858,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",British Philisterwe know were free and theres an end on it!
1859,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","He prefers Lamarcks, The will is, in truth, never free. He"
1860,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",believes man to be a co-ordinate term of Natures great
1861,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",progression; a result of the interaction of organism and
1862,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","environment, working through cosmic sections of time. He views"
1863,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","the human machine, the pipe of flesh, as depending upon the"
1864,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",physical theory of life. Every corporeal fact and phenomenon
1865,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","which, like the tree, grows from within or without, is a mere"
1866,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",product of organization; living bodies being subject to the
1867,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",natural law governing the lifeless and the inorganic. Whilst the
1868,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","religionist assures us that man is not a mere toy of fate, but a"
1869,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","free agent responsible to himself, with work to do and duties to"
1870,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","perform, the Hâjî, with many modern schools, holds Mind to be a"
1871,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",word describing a special operation of matter; the faculties
1872,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",generally to be manifestations of movements in the central
1873,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","nervous system; and every idea, even of the Deity, to be a"
1874,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",certain little pulsation of a certain little mass of animal
1875,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","pap,the brain. Thus he would not object to relationship with a"
1876,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","tailless catarrhine anthropoid ape, descended from a monad or a"
1877,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",primal ascidian.
1878,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1879,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Hence he virtually says, I came into the world without having"
1880,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","applied for or having obtained permission; nay, more, without my"
1881,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",leave being asked or given. Here I find myself hand-tied by
1882,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","conditions, and fettered by laws and circumstances, in making"
1883,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",which my voice had no part. While in the womb I was an automaton;
1884,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","and death will find me a mere machine. Therefore not I, but the"
1885,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Law, or if, you please, the Lawgiver, is answerable for all my"
1886,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",actions. Let me here observe that to the Western mind Law
1887,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","postulates a Lawgiver; not so to the Eastern, and especially to"
1888,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","the Soofi, who holds these ideas to be human, unjustifiably"
1889,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","extended to interpreting the non-human, which men call the"
1890,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Divine.
1891,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1892,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Further he would say, I am an individual (_qui nil habet"
1893,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","dividui_), a circle touching and intersecting my neighbours at"
1894,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","certain points, but nowhere corresponding, nowhere blending."
1895,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Physically I am not identical in all points with other men.
1896,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Morally I differ from them: in nothing do the approaches of
1897,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","knowledge, my five organs of sense (with their Shelleyan"
1898,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","interpretation), exactly resemble those of any other being."
1899,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","_Ergo_, the effect of the world, of life, of natural objects,"
1900,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",will not in my case be the same as with the beings most
1901,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",resembling me. Thus I claim the right of creating or modifying
1902,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",for my own and private use the system which most imports me; and
1903,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","if the reasonable leave be refused to me, I take it without"
1904,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",leave.
1905,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1906,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","But my individuality, however all-sufficient for myself, is an"
1907,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","infinitesimal point, an atom subject in all things to the Law of"
1908,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Storms called Life. I feel, I know that Fate _is_. But I cannot"
1909,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",know what is or what is not fated to befall me. Therefore in the
1910,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","pursuit of perfection as an individual lies my highest, and"
1911,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","indeed my only duty, the I being duly blended with the We. I"
1912,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","object to be a selfless man, which to me denotes an inverted"
1913,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",moral sense. I am bound to take careful thought concerning the
1914,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","consequences of every word and deed. When, however, the Future"
1915,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","has become the Past, it would be the merest vanity for me to"
1916,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",grieve or to repent over that which was decreed by universal
1917,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Law.
1918,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1919,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","The usual objection is that of mans practice. It says, This is"
1920,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","well in theory; but how carry it out? For instance, why would you"
1921,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","kill, or give over to be killed, the man compelled by Fate to"
1922,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","kill your father? Hâjî Abdû replies, I do as others do, not"
1923,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","because the murder was done by him, but because the murderer"
1924,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",should not be allowed another chance of murdering. He is a tiger
1925,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",who has tasted blood and who should be shot. I am convinced that
1926,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","he was a tool in the hands of Fate, but that will not prevent my"
1927,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","taking measures, whether predestined or not, in order to prevent"
1928,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",his being similarly used again.
1929,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1930,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",As with repentance so with conscience. Conscience may be a fear
1931,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",which is the shadow of justice; even as pity is the shadow of
1932,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","love. Though simply a geographical and chronological accident,"
1933,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","which changes with every age of the world, it may deter men from"
1934,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",seeking and securing the prize of successful villainy. But this
1935,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",incentive to beneficence must be applied to actions that will be
1936,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","done, not to deeds that have been done."
1937,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1938,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","The Hâjî, moreover, carefully distinguishes between the working"
1939,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","of fate under a personal God, and under the Reign of Law. In the"
1940,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",former case the contradiction between the foreknowledge of a
1941,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Creator, and the free-will of a Creature, is direct, palpable,"
1942,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",absolute. We might as well talk of black-whiteness and of
1943,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",white-blackness. A hundred generations of divines have never been
1944,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",able to ree the riddle; a million will fail. The difficulty is
1945,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",insurmountable to the Theist whose Almighty is perforce
1946,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Omniscient, and as Omniscient, Prescient. But it disappears when"
1947,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","we convert the Person into Law, or a settled order of events;"
1948,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","subject, moreover, to certain exceptions fixed and immutable, but"
1949,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",at present unknown to man. The difference is essential as that
1950,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","between the penal code with its narrow forbiddal, and the broad"
1951,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",commandment which is a guide rather than a task-master.
1952,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1953,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Thus, too, the belief in fixed Law, versus arbitrary will,"
1954,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",modifies the Hâjîs opinions concerning the pursuit of happiness.
1955,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Mankind, _das rastlose Ursachenthier_, is born to be on the whole"
1956,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","equally happy and miserable. The highest organisms, the fine"
1957,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","porcelain of our family, enjoy the most and suffer the most: they"
1958,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",have a capacity for rising to the empyrean of pleasure and for
1959,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",plunging deep into the swift-flowing river of woe and pain. Thus
1960,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Dante (Inf. vi. 106):
1961,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1962,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",tua scienza
1963,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Che vuol, quanto la cosa è più perfetta"
1964,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Più senta l bene, e cosi la doglienza."
1965,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1966,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","So Buddhism declares that existence in itself implies effort,"
1967,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","pain and sorrow; and, the higher the creature, the more it"
1968,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",suffers. The common clay enjoys little and suffers little. Sum up
1969,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",the whole and distribute the mass: the result will be an average;
1970,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","and the beggar is, on the whole, happy as the prince. Why, then,"
1971,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","asks the objector, does man ever strive and struggle to change,"
1972,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",to rise; a struggle which involves the idea of improving his
1973,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","condition? The Hâjî answers, Because such is the Law under which"
1974,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","man is born: it may be fierce as famine, cruel as the grave, but"
1975,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",man must obey it with blind obedience. He does not enter into
1976,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","the question whether life is worth living, whether man should"
1977,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","elect to be born. Yet his Eastern pessimism, which contrasts so"
1978,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","sharply with the optimism of the West, re-echoes the lines:"
1979,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1980,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","a life,"
1981,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","With large results so little rife,"
1982,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Though bearable seems hardly worth
1983,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","This pomp of words, this pain of birth."
1984,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
1985,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Life, whatever may be its consequence, is built upon a basis of"
1986,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","sorrow. Literature, the voice of humanity, and the verdict of"
1987,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",mankind proclaim that all existence is a state of sadness. The
1988,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",physicians of the Soul would save her melancholy from
1989,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",degenerating into despair by doses of steadfast belief in the
1990,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","presence of God, in the assurance of Immortality, and in visions"
1991,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","of the final victory of good. Were Hâjî Abdû a mere Theologist,"
1992,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","he would add that Sin, not the possibility of revolt, but the"
1993,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","revolt itself against conscience, is the primary form of evil,"
1994,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","because it produces error, moral and intellectual. This man, who"
1995,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","omits to read the Conscience-law, however it may differ from the"
1996,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Society-law, is guilty of negligence. That man, who obscures the"
1997,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","light of Nature with sophistries, becomes incapable of discerning"
1998,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","his own truths. In both cases error, deliberately adopted, is"
1999,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","succeeded by suffering which, we are told, comes in justice and"
2000,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","benevolence as a warning, a remedy, and a chastisement."
2001,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
2002,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",But the Pilgrim is dissatisfied with the idea that evil
2003,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","originates in the individual actions of free agents, ourselves"
2004,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",and others. This doctrine fails to account for its
2005,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","characteristics,essentiality and universality. That creatures"
2006,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",endowed with the mere possibility of liberty should not always
2007,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",choose the Good appears natural. But that of the milliards of
2008,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","human beings who have inhabited the Earth, not one should have"
2009,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","been found invariably to choose Good, proves how insufficient is"
2010,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",the solution. Hence no one believes in the existence of the
2011,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",complete man under the present state of things. The Hâjî rejects
2012,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","all popular and mythical explanation by the Fall of Adam, the"
2013,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","innate depravity of human nature, and the absolute perfection of"
2014,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","certain Incarnations, which argues their divinity. He can only"
2015,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","wail over the prevalence of evil, assume its foundation to be"
2016,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","error, and purpose to abate it by unrooting that Ignorance which"
2017,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",bears and feeds it.
2018,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
2019,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","His eschatology, like that of the Soofis generally, is vague"
2020,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","and shadowy. He may lean towards the doctrine of Marc Aurelius,"
2021,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","The unripe grape, the ripe and the dried: all things are changes"
2022,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","not into nothing, but into that which is not at present. This is"
2023,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",one of the _monstruosa opinionum portenta_ mentioned by the XIXth
2024,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","General Council, alias the First Council of the Vatican. But he"
2025,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","only accepts it with a limitation. He cleaves to the ethical, not"
2026,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","to the intellectual, worship of Nature, which moderns define to"
2027,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",be an unscientific and imaginary synonym for the sum total of
2028,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",observed phenomena. Consequently he holds to the dark and
2029,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","degrading doctrines of the Materialist, the Hylotheist; in"
2030,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","opposition to the spiritualist, a distinction far more marked in"
2031,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","the West than in the East. Europe draws a hard, dry line between"
2032,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Spirit and Matter: Asia does not.
2033,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
2034,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Among us the Idealist objects to the Materialists that the latter
2035,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",cannot agree upon fundamental points; that they cannot define
2036,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",what is an atom; that they cannot account for the transformation
2037,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",of physical action and molecular motion into consciousness; and
2038,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","_vice versâ_, that they cannot say what matter is; and, lastly,"
2039,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",that Berkeley and his school have proved the existence of spirit
2040,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",while denying that of matter.
2041,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
2042,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",The Materialists reply that the want of agreement shows only a
2043,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","study insufficiently advanced; that man cannot describe an atom,"
2044,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","because he is still an infant in science, yet there is no reason"
2045,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",why his mature manhood should not pass through error and
2046,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",incapacity to truth and knowledge; that consciousness becomes a
2047,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",property of matter when certain conditions are present; that Hyle
2048,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",({Greek: hylae}) or Matter may be provisionally defined as
2049,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","phenomena with a substructure of their own, transcendental and"
2050,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","eternal, subject to the action, direct or indirect, of the five"
2051,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","senses, whilst its properties present themselves in three states,"
2052,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","the solid, the liquid, and the gaseous. To casuistical Berkeley"
2053,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",they prefer the common sense of mankind. They ask the idealist
2054,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",and the spiritualist why they cannot find names for themselves
2055,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",without borrowing from a dark and degraded school; why the
2056,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",former must call himself after his eye (_idein_); the latter
2057,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",after his breath (_spiritus_)? Thus the Hâjî twits them with
2058,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","affixing their own limitations to their own Almighty Power, and,"
2059,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","as Socrates said, with bringing down Heaven to the market-place."
2060,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
2061,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Modern thought tends more and more to reject crude idealism and
2062,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","to support the monistic theory, the double aspect, the"
2063,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",transfigured realism. It discusses the Nature of Things in
2064,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Themselves. To the question, is there anything outside of us"
2065,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","which corresponds with our sensations? that is to say, is the"
2066,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","whole world simply I, they reply that obviously there is a"
2067,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",something else; and that this something else produces the
2068,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",brain-disturbance which is called sensation. Instinct orders us
2069,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",to do something; Reason (the balance of faculties) directs; and
2070,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","the strongest motive controls. Modern Science, by the discovery"
2071,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","of Radiant Matter, a fourth condition, seems to conciliate the"
2072,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","two schools. La découverte dun quatrième état de la matière,"
2073,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","says a Reviewer, cest la porte ouverte à linfini de ses"
2074,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",transformations; cest lhomme invisible et impalpable de même
2075,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",possible sans cesser dêtre substantiel; cest le monde des
2076,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",esprits entrant sans absurdité dans la domaine des hypothèses
2077,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",scientifiques; cest la possibilité pour le matérialiste de
2078,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","croire à la vie doutre tombe, sans renoncer au substratum"
2079,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",matériel quil croit nécessaire au maintien de lindividualité.
2080,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
2081,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","With Hâjî Abdû the soul is not material, for that would be a"
2082,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","contradiction of terms. He regards it, with many moderns, as a"
2083,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","state of things, not a thing; a convenient word denoting the"
2084,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","sense of personality, of individual identity. In its ghostly"
2085,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",signification he discovers an artificial dogma which could hardly
2086,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",belong to the brutal savages of the Stone Age. He finds it in the
2087,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","funereal books of ancient Egypt, whence probably it passed to the"
2088,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Zendavesta and the Vedas. In the Hebrew Pentateuch, of which part"
2089,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","is still attributed to Moses, it is unknown, or, rather, it is"
2090,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",deliberately ignored by the author or authors. The early
2091,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Christians could not agree upon the subject; Origen advocated the
2092,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","pre-existence of mens souls, supposing them to have been all"
2093,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",created at one time and successively embodied. Others make Spirit
2094,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",born with the hour of birth: and so forth.
2095,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
2096,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","But the brain-action or, if you so phrase it, the mind, is not"
2097,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",confined to the reasoning faculties; nor can we afford to ignore
2098,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","the sentiments, the affections which are, perhaps, the most"
2099,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",potent realities of life. Their loud affirmative voice contrasts
2100,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",strongly with the titubant accents of the intellect. They seem to
2101,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","demand a future life, even, a state of rewards and punishments"
2102,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","from the Maker of the world, the _Ortolano Eterno_,[1] the Potter"
2103,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","of the East, the Watchmaker of the West. They protest against the"
2104,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",idea of annihilation. They revolt at the notion of eternal
2105,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","parting from parents, kinsmen and friends. Yet the dogma of a"
2106,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",future life is by no means catholic and universal. The
2107,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","Anglo-European race apparently cannot exist without it, and we"
2108,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",have lately heard of the Aryan Soul-land. On the other hand
2109,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",many of the Buddhist and even the Brahman Schools preach Nirwâna
2110,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",(comparative non-existence) and Parinirwâna (absolute
2111,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","nothingness). Moreover, the great Turanian family, actually"
2112,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","occupying all Eastern Asia, has ever ignored it; and the"
2113,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","200,000,000 of Chinese Confucians, the mass of the nation,"
2114,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","protest emphatically against the mainstay of the western creeds,"
2115,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",because it unfits men for the business and duty of life by
2116,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",fixing their speculations on an unknown world. And even its
2117,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","votaries, in all ages, races and faiths, cannot deny that the"
2118,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","next world is a copy, more or less idealized, of the present; and"
2119,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",that it lacks a single particular savouring of originality. It is
2120,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",in fact a mere continuation; and the continuation is not
2121,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",proven.
2122,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
2123,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",It is most hard to be a man;
2124,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
2125,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","and the Pilgrims sole consolation is in self-cultivation, and in"
2126,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",the pleasures of the affections. This sympathy may be an indirect
2127,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","self-love, a reflection of the light of egotism: still it is so"
2128,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",transferred as to imply a different system of convictions. It
2129,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",requires a different name: to call benevolence self-love is to
2130,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",make the fruit or flower not only depend upon a root for
2131,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","development (which is true), but the very root itself (which is"
2132,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN","false). And, finally, his ideal is of the highest: his praise is"
2133,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",reserved for:
2134,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",
2135,"HÂJÎ ABDÛ, THE MAN",Lives

2152,NOTE II,
2153,NOTE II,A few words concerning the Kasîdah itself. Our Hâjî begins with a
2154,NOTE II,_mise-en-scène_; and takes leave of the Caravan setting out for
2155,NOTE II,"Mecca. He sees the Wolfs tail (_Dum-i-gurg_), the {Greek:"
2156,NOTE II,"lykaugés}, or wolf-gleam, the Diluculum, the Zodiacal dawn-light,"
2157,NOTE II,the first faint brushes of white radiating from below the Eastern
2158,NOTE II,"horizon. It is accompanied by the morning-breath (_Dam-i-Subh_),"
2159,NOTE II,"the current of air, almost imperceptible except by the increase"
2160,NOTE II,"of cold, which Moslem physiologists suppose to be the early"
2161,NOTE II,prayer offered by Nature to the First Cause. The Ghoul-i-Biyâbân
2162,NOTE II,(Desert-Demon) is evidently the personification of mans fears
2163,NOTE II,and of the dangers that surround travelling in the wilds. The
2164,NOTE II,wold-where-none-save-He (Allah)-can-dwell is a great and
2165,NOTE II,terrible wilderness (_Dasht-i-lâ-siwâ Hu_); and Allahs Holy Hill
2166,NOTE II,"is Arafât, near Mecca, which the Caravan reaches after passing"
2167,NOTE II,through Medina. The first section ends with a sore lament that
2168,NOTE II,the meetings of this world take place upon the highway of
2169,NOTE II,Separation; and the original also has:
2170,NOTE II,
2171,NOTE II,The chill of sorrow numbs my thought:
2172,NOTE II,methinks I hear the passing knell;
2173,NOTE II,As dies across yon thin blue line
2174,NOTE II,the tinkling of the Camel-bell.
2175,NOTE II,
2176,NOTE II,The next section quotes the various aspects under which Life
2177,NOTE II,appeared to the wise and foolish teachers of humanity. First
2178,NOTE II,"comes Hafiz, whose well-known lines are quoted beginning with"
2179,NOTE II,"Shab-i-târîk o bîm-i-mauj, etc. Hûr is the plural of Ahwar, in"
2180,NOTE II,"full Ahwar el-Ayn, a maid whose eyes are intensely white where"
2181,NOTE II,"they should be white, and black elsewhere: hence our silly"
2182,NOTE II,"Houries. Follows Umar-i-Khayyâm, who spiritualized Tasawwof, or"
2183,NOTE II,"Sooffeism, even as the Soofis (Gnostics) spiritualized Moslem"
2184,NOTE II,Puritanism. The verses alluded to are:
2185,NOTE II,
2186,NOTE II,"You know, my friends, with what a brave carouse"
2187,NOTE II,"I made a second marriage in my house,"
2188,NOTE II,Divorced old barren Reason from my bed
2189,NOTE II,And took the Daughter of the Vine to spouse.
2190,NOTE II,"(St. 60, Mr. Fitzgeralds translation.)"
2191,NOTE II,
2192,NOTE II,Here Wine is used in its mystic sense of entranced Love for the
2193,NOTE II,Soul of Souls. Umar was hated and feared because he spoke boldly
2194,NOTE II,when his brethren the Soofis dealt in innuendoes. A third
2195,NOTE II,"quotation has been trained into a likeness of the Hymn of Life,"
2196,NOTE II,despite the commonplace and the _navrante vulgarité_ which
2197,NOTE II,characterize the pseudo-Schiller-Anglo-American School. The same
2198,NOTE II,"has been done to the words of Isâ (Jesus); for the author, who is"
2199,NOTE II,"well-read in the Ingîl (Evangel), evidently intended the"
2200,NOTE II,allusion. Mansur el-Hallâj (the Cotton-Cleaner) was stoned for
2201,NOTE II,crudely uttering the Pantheistic dogma _Ana l Hakk_ (I am the
2202,NOTE II,"Truth, _i.e._, God), _wa laysa fi-jubbatî il Allah_ (and within"
2203,NOTE II,my coat is nought but God). His blood traced on the ground the
2204,NOTE II,"first-quoted sentence. Lastly, there is a quotation from"
2205,NOTE II,"Sardanapalus, son of Anacyndaraxes, etc.: here {Greek: paîze}"
2206,NOTE II,may mean sport; but the context determines the kind of sport
2207,NOTE II,intended. The Zâhid is the literal believer in the letter of the
2208,NOTE II,"Law, opposed to the Soofi, who believes in its spirit: hence the"
2209,NOTE II,"former is called a Zâhiri (outsider), and the latter a Bâtini, an"
2210,NOTE II,insider. Moses is quoted because he ignored future rewards and
2211,NOTE II,"punishments. As regards the two Eternities, Persian and Arab"
2212,NOTE II,"metaphysicians split Eternity, _i.e._, the negation of Time, into"
2213,NOTE II,"two halves, _Azal_ (beginninglessness) and _Abad_ (endlessness);"
2214,NOTE II,"both being mere words, gatherings of letters with a subjective"
2215,NOTE II,"significance. In English we use Eternal (_Æviternus_, age-long,"
2216,NOTE II,"life-long) as loosely, by applying it to three distinct ideas;"
2217,NOTE II,"(1) the habitual, in popular parlance; (2) the exempt from"
2218,NOTE II,"duration; and (3) the everlasting, which embraces all duration."
2219,NOTE II,Omniscience-Maker is the old Roman sceptics _Homo fecit Deos_.
2220,NOTE II,
2221,NOTE II,"The next section is one long wail over the contradictions, the"
2222,NOTE II,"mysteries, the dark end, the infinite sorrowfulness of all"
2223,NOTE II,"existence, and the arcanum of grief which, Luther said, underlies"
2224,NOTE II,"all life. As with Euripides to live is to die, to die is to"
2225,NOTE II,live. Hâjî Abdû borrows the Hindu idea of the human body. It is
2226,NOTE II,"a mansion, says Menu, with bones for its beams and rafters;"
2227,NOTE II,with nerves and tendons for cords; with muscles and blood for
2228,NOTE II,cement; with skin for its outer covering; filled with no sweet
2229,NOTE II,"perfume, but loaded with impurities; a mansion infested by age"
2230,NOTE II,and sorrow; the seat of malady; harassed with pains; haunted with
2231,NOTE II,"the quality of darkness (Tama-guna), and incapable of standing."
2232,NOTE II,The Pot and Potter began with the ancient Egyptians. Sitting as
2233,NOTE II,"a potter at the wheel, Cneph (at Philæ) moulds clay, and gives"
2234,NOTE II,the spirit of life to the nostrils of Osiris. Hence the
2235,NOTE II,"Genesitic breath. Then we meet him in the Vedas, the Being by"
2236,NOTE II,whom the fictile vase is formed; the clay out of which it is
2237,NOTE II,fabricated. We find him next in Jeremiahs Arise and go down
2238,NOTE II,"unto the Potters house, etc. (xviii. 2), and lastly in Romans"
2239,NOTE II,"(ix. 20), Hath not the potter power over the clay? No wonder"
2240,NOTE II,that the first Hand who moulded the man-mud is a _lieu commun_ in
2241,NOTE II,"Eastern thought. The waste of agony is Buddhism, or"
2242,NOTE II,"Schopenhauerism pure and simple, I have moulded Earth on Earth"
2243,NOTE II,upon Seint Ysidres well-known rhymes (A.D. 1440):
2244,NOTE II,
2245,NOTE II,"Erthe out of Erthe is wondirli wrouzt,"
2246,NOTE II,"Erthe out of Erthe hath gete a dignity of nouzt,"
2247,NOTE II,Erthe upon Erthe hath sett all his thouzt
2248,NOTE II,"How that Erthe upon Erthe may be his brouzt, etc."
2249,NOTE II,
2250,NOTE II,"The Camel-rider, suggests Ossian, yet a few years and the"
2251,NOTE II,blast of the desert comes. The dromedary was chosen as Deaths
2252,NOTE II,"vehicle by the Arabs, probably because it bears the Bedouins"
2253,NOTE II,"corpse to the distant burial-ground, where he will lie among his"
2254,NOTE II,kith and kin. The end of this section reminds us of:
2255,NOTE II,
2256,NOTE II,"How poor, how rich; how abject, how august,"
2257,NOTE II,"How complicate, how wonderful is Man!"
2258,NOTE II,
2259,NOTE II,The Hâjî now passes to the results of his long and anxious
2260,NOTE II,thoughts: I have purposely twisted his exordium into an echo of
2261,NOTE II,Milton:
2262,NOTE II,
2263,NOTE II,Till old experience doth attain
2264,NOTE II,To something of prophetic strain.
2265,NOTE II,
2266,NOTE II,He boldly declares that there is no God as man has created his
2267,NOTE II,Creator. Here he is at one with modern thought:En général les
2268,NOTE II,"croyants font le Dieu comme ils sont eux-mêmes, (says J. J."
2269,NOTE II,"Rousseau, Confessions, I. 6): les bons le font bon: les"
2270,NOTE II,"méchants le font méchant: les dévots haineux et bilieux, ne"
2271,NOTE II,"voient que lenfer, parce quils voudraient damner tout le monde;"
2272,NOTE II,les âmes aimantes et douces ny croient guère; et lun des
2273,NOTE II,étonnements dont je ne reviens pas est de voir le bon Fénélon en
2274,NOTE II,parler dans son Télémaque comme sil y croyoit tout de bon: mais
2275,NOTE II,jespère quil mentoit alors; car enfin quelque véridique quon
2276,NOTE II,"soit, il faut bien mentir quelquefois quand on est évêque. Man"
2277,NOTE II,"depicts himself in his gods, says Schiller. Hence the"
2278,NOTE II,"_Naturgott_, the deity of all ancient peoples, and with which"
2279,NOTE II,"every system began, allowed and approved of actions distinctly"
2280,NOTE II,"immoral, often diabolical. Belief became moralized only when the"
2281,NOTE II,"conscience of the community, and with it of the individual items,"
2282,NOTE II,"began aspiring to its golden age,Perfection. Dieu est le"
2283,NOTE II,"superlatif, dont le positif est lhomme, says Carl Vogt;"
2284,NOTE II,"meaning, that the popular idea of a _numen_ is that of a"
2285,NOTE II,magnified and non-natural man.
2286,NOTE II,
2287,NOTE II,"He then quotes his authorities. Buddha, whom the Catholic Church"
2288,NOTE II,"converted to Saint Josaphat, refused to recognize Ishwara (the"
2289,NOTE II,"deity), on account of the mystery of the cruelty of things."
2290,NOTE II,"Schopenhauer, Miss Cobbes model pessimist, who at the humblest"
2291,NOTE II,"distance represents Buddha in the world of Western thought, found"
2292,NOTE II,"the vision of mans unhappiness, irrespective of his actions, so"
2293,NOTE II,"overpowering that he concluded the Supreme Will to be malevolent,"
2294,NOTE II,"heartless, cowardly, and arrogant. Confucius, the Throneless"
2295,NOTE II,"king, more powerful than all kings, denied a personal deity. The"
2296,NOTE II,"Epicurean idea rules the China of the present day. God is great,"
2297,NOTE II,"but he lives too far off, say the Turanian Santâls in Aryan"
2298,NOTE II,India; and this is the general language of man in the Turanian
2299,NOTE II,East.
2300,NOTE II,
2301,NOTE II,Hâjî Abdû evidently holds that idolatry begins with a personal
2302,NOTE II,deity. And let us note that the latter is deliberately denied by
2303,NOTE II,the Thirty-nine Articles. With them God is a Being without
2304,NOTE II,Parts (personality) or Passions. He professes a vague
2305,NOTE II,"Agnosticism, and attributes popular faith to the fact that Timor"
2306,NOTE II,"fecit Deos; every religion being, without exception, the child"
2307,NOTE II,of fear and ignorance (Carl Vogt). He now speaks as the Drawer
2308,NOTE II,"of the Wine, the Ancient Taverner, the Old Magus, the"
2309,NOTE II,Patron of the Mughân or Magians; all titles applied to the
2310,NOTE II,Soofi as opposed to the Zâhid. His idols are the eidola
2311,NOTE II,"(illusions) of Bacon, having their foundations in the very"
2312,NOTE II,"constitution of man, and therefore appropriately called"
2313,NOTE II,_fabulæ_. That Natures Common Course is subject to various
2314,NOTE II,"interpretation, may be easily proved. Aristotle was as great a"
2315,NOTE II,subverter as Alexander; but the quasi-prophetical Stagyrite of
2316,NOTE II,"the Dark Ages, who ruled the world till the end of the thirteenth"
2317,NOTE II,"century, became the twice execrable of Martin Luther; and was"
2318,NOTE II,finally abolished by Galileo and Newton. Here I have excised two
2319,NOTE II,stanzas. The first is:
2320,NOTE II,
2321,NOTE II,"Theories for truths, fable for fact;"
2322,NOTE II,system for science vex the thought
2323,NOTE II,Lifes one great lesson you despise
2324,NOTE II,to know that all we know is nought.
2325,NOTE II,
2326,NOTE II,This is in fact:
2327,NOTE II,
2328,NOTE II,"Well didst thou say, Athenas noblest son,"
2329,NOTE II,The most we know is nothing can be known.
2330,NOTE II,
2331,NOTE II,The next is:
2332,NOTE II,
2333,NOTE II,"Essence and substance, sequence, cause,"
2334,NOTE II,"beginning, ending, space and time,"
2335,NOTE II,"These be the toys of manhoods mind,"
2336,NOTE II,at once ridiculous and sublime.
2337,NOTE II,
2338,NOTE II,He is not the only one who so regards bothering Time and Space.
2339,NOTE II,"A late definition of the infinitely great, viz., that the idea"
2340,NOTE II,arises from denying form to any figure; of the infinitely
2341,NOTE II,"small, from refusing magnitude to any figure, is a fair specimen"
2342,NOTE II,of the dismal sciencemetaphysics.
2343,NOTE II,
2344,NOTE II,Another omitted stanza reads:
2345,NOTE II,
2346,NOTE II,"How canst thou, Phenomen! pretend"
2347,NOTE II,the Noumenon to mete and span?
2348,NOTE II,"Say which were easier probed and proved,"
2349,NOTE II,Absolute Being or mortal man?
2350,NOTE II,
2351,NOTE II,One would think that he had read Kant on the Knowable and the
2352,NOTE II,"Unknowable, or had heard of the Yankee lady, who could"
2353,NOTE II,differentiate between the Finite and the Infinite. It is a
2354,NOTE II,"common-place of the age, in the West as well as the East, that"
2355,NOTE II,"Science is confined to phenomena, and cannot reach the Noumena,"
2356,NOTE II,"the things themselves. This is the scholastic realism, the"
2357,NOTE II,"residuum of a bad metaphysic, which deforms the system of"
2358,NOTE II,"Comte. With all its pretensions, it simply means that there are,"
2359,NOTE II,"or can be conceived, things in themselves (_i.e._, unrelated to"
2360,NOTE II,"thought); that we know them to exist; and, at the same time, that"
2361,NOTE II,we cannot know what they are. But who dares say cannot? Who can
2362,NOTE II,measure mans work when he shall be as superior to our present
2363,NOTE II,selves as we are to the Cave-man of past time?
2364,NOTE II,
2365,NOTE II,"The Chain of Universe alludes to the Jain idea that the whole,"
2366,NOTE II,"consisting of intellectual as well as of natural principles,"
2367,NOTE II,existed from all eternity; and that it has been subject to
2368,NOTE II,"endless revolutions, whose causes are the inherent powers of"
2369,NOTE II,"nature, intellectual as well as physical, without the"
2370,NOTE II,"intervention of a deity. But the Poet ridicules the non-human,"
2371,NOTE II,"_i.e._, the not-ourselves, the negation of ourselves and"
2372,NOTE II,consequently a non-existence. Most Easterns confuse the
2373,NOTE II,"contradictories, in which one term stands for something, and the"
2374,NOTE II,"other for nothing (_e.g._, ourselves and not-ourselves), with the"
2375,NOTE II,"contraries (_e.g._, rich and not-rich = poor), in which both"
2376,NOTE II,terms express a something. So the positive-negative infinite is
2377,NOTE II,"not the complement of finite, but its negation. The Western man"
2378,NOTE II,derides the process by making not-horse the complementary
2379,NOTE II,entity of horse. The Pilgrim ends with the favourite Soofi
2380,NOTE II,tenet that the five (six?) senses are the doors of all human
2381,NOTE II,"knowledge, and that no form of man, incarnation of the deity,"
2382,NOTE II,"prophet, apostle or sage, has ever produced an idea not conceived"
2383,NOTE II,within his brain by the sole operation of these vulgar material
2384,NOTE II,agents. Evidently he is neither spiritualist nor idealist.
2385,NOTE II,
2386,NOTE II,"He then proceeds to show that man depicts himself in his God, and"
2387,NOTE II,"that God is the racial expression; a pedagogue on the Nile, an"
2388,NOTE II,"abstraction in India, and an astrologer in Chaldæa; where"
2389,NOTE II,"Abraham, says Berosus (Josephus, Ant. I. 7, § 2, and II. 9, § 2)"
2390,NOTE II,was skilful in the celestial science. He notices the
2391,NOTE II,"Akârana-Zamân (endless Time) of the Guebres, and the working"
2392,NOTE II,"dual, Hormuzd and Ahriman. He brands the God of the Hebrews with"
2393,NOTE II,pugnacity and cruelty. He has heard of the beautiful creations of
2394,NOTE II,"Greek fancy which, not attributing a moral nature to the deity,"
2395,NOTE II,"included Theology in Physics; and which, like Professor Tyndall,"
2396,NOTE II,seemed to consider all matter everywhere alive. We have adopted a
2397,NOTE II,"very different Unitarianism; Theology, with its one Creator;"
2398,NOTE II,Pantheism with its one Spirits plastic stress; and Science
2399,NOTE II,with its one Energy. He is hard upon Christianity and its trinal
2400,NOTE II,"God: I have not softened his expression ({Arabic} = a riddle),"
2401,NOTE II,although it may offend readers. There is nothing more enigmatical
2402,NOTE II,to the Moslem mind than Christian Trinitarianism: all other
2403,NOTE II,"objections they can get over, not this. Nor is he any lover of"
2404,NOTE II,"Islamism, which, like Christianity, has its ascetic Hebraism and"
2405,NOTE II,its Hellenic hedonism; with the world of thought moving between
2406,NOTE II,"these two extremes. The former, defined as predominant or"
2407,NOTE II,"exclusive care for the practice of right, is represented by"
2408,NOTE II,"Semitic and Arab influence, Korânic and Hadîsic. The latter, the"
2409,NOTE II,"religion of humanity, a passion for life and light, for culture"
2410,NOTE II,"and intelligence; for art, poetry and science, is represented in"
2411,NOTE II,Islamism by the fondly and impiously-cherished memory of the old
2412,NOTE II,"Guebre kings and heroes, beauties, bards and sages. Hence the"
2413,NOTE II,mention of Zâl and his son Rostam; of Cyrus and of the
2414,NOTE II,"Jâm-i-Jamshîd, which may be translated either grail (cup) or"
2415,NOTE II,mirror: it showed the whole world within its rim; and hence it
2416,NOTE II,was called Jâm-i-Jehân-numâ (universe-exposing). The contemptuous
2417,NOTE II,expressions about the diet of camels milk and the meat of the
2418,NOTE II,"Susmâr, or green lizard, are evidently quoted from Firdausis"
2419,NOTE II,famous lines beginning:
2420,NOTE II,
2421,NOTE II,Arab-râ be-jâî rasîdest kâr.
2422,NOTE II,
2423,NOTE II,The Hâjî is severe upon those who make of the Deity a
2424,NOTE II,Khwân-i-yaghmâ (or tray of plunder) as the Persians phrase it. He
2425,NOTE II,"looks upon the shepherds as men,"
2426,NOTE II,
2427,NOTE II,Who rob the sheep themselves to clothe.
2428,NOTE II,
2429,NOTE II,"So Schopenhauer (Leben, etc., by Wilhelm Gewinner) furiously"
2430,NOTE II,shows how the English nation ought to treat that set of
2431,NOTE II,"hypocrites, imposters and money-graspers, the clergy, that"
2432,NOTE II,"annually devours £3,500,000."
2433,NOTE II,
2434,NOTE II,The Hâjî broadly asserts that there is no Good and no Evil in the
2435,NOTE II,absolute sense as man has made them. Here he is one with Pope:
2436,NOTE II,
2437,NOTE II,"And spite of pride, in erring natures spite"
2438,NOTE II,"One truth is clearwhatever is, is right."
2439,NOTE II,
2440,NOTE II,"Unfortunately the converse is just as true:whatever is, is"
2441,NOTE II,wrong. Khizr is the Elijah who puzzled Milman. He represents the
2442,NOTE II,"Soofi, the Bâtini, while Musâ (Moses) is the Zâhid, the Zâhiri;"
2443,NOTE II,"and the strange adventures of the twain, invented by the Jews,"
2444,NOTE II,have been appropriated by the Moslems. He derides the Freewill of
2445,NOTE II,"man; and, like Diderot, he detects pantaloon in a prelate, a"
2446,NOTE II,"satyr in a president, a pig in a priest, an ostrich in a"
2447,NOTE II,"minister, and a goose in a chief clerk. He holds to Fortune, the"
2448,NOTE II,"{Greek: Túxae} of Alcman, which is, {Greek: Eunomías te kaì"
2449,NOTE II,"Peithoûs adelphà kaì Promatheías thugátaer},Chance, the sister"
2450,NOTE II,"of Order and Trust, and the daughter of Forethought. The"
2451,NOTE II,"Scandinavian Spinners of Fate were Urd (the Was, the Past),"
2452,NOTE II,"Verdandi (the Becoming, or Present), and Skuld (the To-be, or"
2453,NOTE II,"Future). He alludes to Plato, who made the Demiourgos create the"
2454,NOTE II,"worlds by the Logos (the Hebrew Dabar) or Creative Word, through"
2455,NOTE II,the Æons. These {Greek: Aìwnes} of the Mystics were spiritual
2456,NOTE II,"emanations from {Greek: Aìwn}, lit. a wave of influx, an age,"
2457,NOTE II,"period, or day; hence the Latin _ævum_, and the Welsh Awen, the"
2458,NOTE II,"stream of inspiration falling upon a bard. Basilides, the"
2459,NOTE II,"Egypto-Christian, made the Creator evolve seven Æons or Pteromata"
2460,NOTE II,"(fulnesses); from two of whom, Wisdom and Power, proceeded the"
2461,NOTE II,"365 degrees of Angels. All were subject to a Prince of Heaven,"
2462,NOTE II,"called Abraxas, who was himself under guidance of the chief Æon,"
2463,NOTE II,Wisdom. Others represent the first Cause to have produced an Æon
2464,NOTE II,"or Pure Intelligence; the first a second, and so forth till the"
2465,NOTE II,"tenth. This was material enough to affect Hyle, which thereby"
2466,NOTE II,assumed a spiritual form. Thus the two incompatibles combined in
2467,NOTE II,the Scheme of Creation.
2468,NOTE II,
2469,NOTE II,He denies the three ages of the Buddhists: the wholly happy; the
2470,NOTE II,"happy mixed with misery, and the miserable tinged with"
2471,NOTE II,"happiness,the present. The Zoroastrians had four, each of 3,000"
2472,NOTE II,"years. In the first, Hormuzd, the good-god, ruled alone; then"
2473,NOTE II,"Ahriman, the bad-god, began to rule subserviently: in the third"
2474,NOTE II,"both ruled equally; and in the last, now current, Ahriman has"
2475,NOTE II,gained the day.
2476,NOTE II,
2477,NOTE II,Against the popular idea that man has caused the misery of this
2478,NOTE II,"world, he cites the ages, when the Old Red Sandstone bred"
2479,NOTE II,gigantic cannibal fishes; when the Oolites produced the mighty
2480,NOTE II,"reptile tyrants of air, earth, and sea; and when the monsters of"
2481,NOTE II,the Eocene and Miocene periods shook the ground with their
2482,NOTE II,ponderous tread. And the world of waters is still a hideous scene
2483,NOTE II,"of cruelty, carnage, and destruction."
2484,NOTE II,
2485,NOTE II,He declares Conscience to be a geographical and chronological
2486,NOTE II,accident. Thus he answers the modern philosopher whose soul was
2487,NOTE II,"overwhelmed by the marvel and the awe of two things, the starry"
2488,NOTE II,heaven above and the moral law within. He makes the latter sense
2489,NOTE II,a development of the gregarious and social instincts; and so
2490,NOTE II,travellers have observed that the moral is the last step in
2491,NOTE II,mental progress. His Moors are the savage Dankali and other
2492,NOTE II,"negroid tribes, who offer a cup of milk with one hand and stab"
2493,NOTE II,with the other. He translates literally the Indian word Hâthî (an
2494,NOTE II,"elephant), the animal with the Hâth (hand, or trunk). Finally he"
2495,NOTE II,"alludes to the age of active volcanoes, the present, which is"
2496,NOTE II,"merely temporary, the shifting of the Pole, and the spectacle to"
2497,NOTE II,"be seen from Mushtari, or the planet Jupiter."
2498,NOTE II,
2499,NOTE II,"The Hâjî again asks the old, old question, What is Truth? And he"
2500,NOTE II,"answers himself, after the fashion of the wise Emperor of China,"
2501,NOTE II,Truth hath not an unchanging name. A modern English writer
2502,NOTE II,"says: I have long been convinced by the experience of my life,"
2503,NOTE II,"as a pioneer of various heterodoxies, which are rapidly becoming"
2504,NOTE II,"orthodoxies, that nearly all truth is temperamental to us, or"
2505,NOTE II,given in the affections and intuitions; and that discussion and
2506,NOTE II,inquiry do little more than feed temperament. Our poet seems to
2507,NOTE II,"mean that the Perceptions, when they perceive truly, convey"
2508,NOTE II,"objective truth, which is universal; whereas the Reflectives and"
2509,NOTE II,"the Sentiments, the working of the moral region, or the middle"
2510,NOTE II,"lobe of the phrenologists, supplies only subjective truth,"
2511,NOTE II,"personal and individual. Thus to one man the axiom, _Opes"
2512,NOTE II,"irritamenta malorum_, represents a distinct fact; while another"
2513,NOTE II,holds wealth to be an incentive for good. Evidently both are
2514,NOTE II,"right, according to their lights."
2515,NOTE II,
2516,NOTE II,"Hâjî Abdû cites Plato and Aristotle, as usual with Eastern"
2517,NOTE II,"songsters, who delight in Mantik (logic). Here he appears to mean"
2518,NOTE II,that a false proposition is as real a proposition as one that is
2519,NOTE II,true. Faith moves mountains and Manet immota fides are
2520,NOTE II,evidently quotations. He derides the teaching of the First
2521,NOTE II,"Council of the Vatican (cap. v.), all the faithful are little"
2522,NOTE II,"children listening to the voice of Saint Peter, who is the"
2523,NOTE II,Prince of the Apostles. He glances at the fancy of certain
2524,NOTE II,"modern physicists, devotion is a definite molecular change in"
2525,NOTE II,the convolution of grey pulp. He notices with contumely the
2526,NOTE II,"riddle of which Milton speaks so glibly, where the Dialoguists,"
2527,NOTE II,
2528,NOTE II,reasoned high
2529,NOTE II,"Of providence, foreknowledge, will and fate,"
2530,NOTE II,"Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute."
2531,NOTE II,
2532,NOTE II,In opposition to the orthodox Mohammedan tenets which make Mans
2533,NOTE II,"soul his percipient Ego, an entity, a unity, the Soofi considers"
2534,NOTE II,"it a fancy, opposed to body, which is a fact; at most a state of"
2535,NOTE II,"things, not a thing; a consensus of faculties whereof our frames"
2536,NOTE II,are but the phenomena. This is not contrary to Genesitic legend.
2537,NOTE II,"The Hebrew Ruach and Arabic Ruh, now perverted to mean soul or"
2538,NOTE II,"spirit, simply signify wind or breath, the outward and visible"
2539,NOTE II,sign of life. Their later schools are even more explicit. For
2540,NOTE II,"that which befalls man befalls beasts; as the one dies, so does"
2541,NOTE II,the other; they have all one death; all go unto one place
2542,NOTE II,"(Eccles. iii. 19). But the modern soul, a nothing, a string of"
2543,NOTE II,"negations, a negative in chief, is thus described in the"
2544,NOTE II,"Mahâbhârat: It is indivisible, inconceivable, inconceptible: it"
2545,NOTE II,"is eternal, universal, permanent, immovable: it is invisible and"
2546,NOTE II,"unalterable. Hence the modern spiritualism which, rejecting"
2547,NOTE II,"materialism, can use only material language."
2548,NOTE II,
2549,NOTE II,"These, says the Hâjî, are mere sounds. He would not assert Verba"
2550,NOTE II,"gignunt verba, but Verba gignunt res, a step further. The idea"
2551,NOTE II,"is Bacons idola fori, omnium molestissima, the twofold"
2552,NOTE II,illusions of language; either the names of things that have no
2553,NOTE II,"existence in fact, or the names of things whose idea is confused"
2554,NOTE II,and ill-defined.
2555,NOTE II,
2556,NOTE II,He derives the Soul-idea from the savage ghost which Dr.
2557,NOTE II,Johnson defined to be a kind of shadowy being. He justly
2558,NOTE II,remarks that it arose (perhaps) in Egypt; and was not invented by
2559,NOTE II,the People of the Book. By this term Moslems denote Jews and
2560,NOTE II,"Christians who have a recognized revelation, while their"
2561,NOTE II,"ignorance refuses it to Guebres, Hindus, and Confucians."
2562,NOTE II,
2563,NOTE II,He evidently holds to the doctrine of progress. With him
2564,NOTE II,"protoplasm is the Yliastron, the Prima Materies. Our word matter"
2565,NOTE II,"is derived from the Sanskrit {Sanskrit} (mâtrâ), which, however,"
2566,NOTE II,signifies properly the invisible type of visible matter; in
2567,NOTE II,"modern language, the substance distinct from the sum of its"
2568,NOTE II,"physical and chemical properties. Thus, Mâtrâ exists only in"
2569,NOTE II,"thought, and is not recognizable by the action of the five"
2570,NOTE II,senses. His Chain of Being reminds us of Prof. Huxleys
2571,NOTE II,"Pedigree of the Horse, Orohippus, Mesohippus, Meiohippus,"
2572,NOTE II,"Protohippus, Pleiohippus, and Equus. He has evidently heard of"
2573,NOTE II,"modern biology, or Hylozoism, which holds its quarter-million"
2574,NOTE II,"species of living beings, animal and vegetable, to be progressive"
2575,NOTE II,"modifications of one great fundamental unity, an unity of"
2576,NOTE II,so-called mental faculties as well as of bodily structure. And
2577,NOTE II,this is the jelly-speck. He scoffs at the popular idea that man
2578,NOTE II,is the great central figure round which all things gyrate like
2579,NOTE II,"marionettes; in fact, the anthropocentric era of Draper, which,"
2580,NOTE II,"strange to say, lives by the side of the telescope and the"
2581,NOTE II,"microscope. As man is of recent origin, and may end at an early"
2582,NOTE II,"epoch of the macrocosm, so before his birth all things revolved"
2583,NOTE II,"round nothing, and may continue to do so after his death."
2584,NOTE II,
2585,NOTE II,"The Hâjî, who elsewhere denounces compound ignorance, holds"
2586,NOTE II,that all evil comes from error; and that all knowledge has been
2587,NOTE II,"developed by overthrowing error, the ordinary channel of human"
2588,NOTE II,thought. He ends this section with a great truth. There are
2589,NOTE II,"things which human Reason or Instinct matured, in its undeveloped"
2590,NOTE II,"state, cannot master; but Reason is a Law to itself. Therefore we"
2591,NOTE II,"are not bound to believe, or to attempt belief in, any thing"
2592,NOTE II,which is contrary or contradictory to Reason. Here he is
2593,NOTE II,"diametrically opposed to Rome, who says, Do not appeal to"
2594,NOTE II,History; that is private judgment. Do not appeal to Holy Writ;
2595,NOTE II,that is heresy. Do not appeal to Reason; that is Rationalism.
2596,NOTE II,
2597,NOTE II,"He holds with the Patriarchs of Hebrew Holy Writ, that the"
2598,NOTE II,present life is all-sufficient for an intellectual (not a
2599,NOTE II,"sentimental) being; and, therefore, that there is no want of a"
2600,NOTE II,Heaven or a Hell. With far more contradiction the Western poet
2601,NOTE II,sings:
2602,NOTE II,
2603,NOTE II,"Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscribed"
2604,NOTE II,"In one self-place; but when we are in hell,"
2605,NOTE II,"And where hell is there must we ever be,"
2606,NOTE II,"And, to be short, when all this world dissolves,"
2607,NOTE II,"And every creature shall be purified,"
2608,NOTE II,All places shall be hell which are not heaven.
2609,NOTE II,
2610,NOTE II,For what want is there of a Hell when all are pure? He enlarges
2611,NOTE II,"upon the ancient Buddhist theory, that Happiness and Misery are"
2612,NOTE II,equally distributed among men and beasts; some enjoy much and
2613,NOTE II,"suffer much; others the reverse. Hence Diderot declares, Sober"
2614,NOTE II,passions produce only the commonplace . . . the man of moderate
2615,NOTE II,passion lives and dies like a brute. And again we have the half
2616,NOTE II,truth:
2617,NOTE II,
2618,NOTE II,That the mark of rank in nature
2619,NOTE II,Is capacity for pain.
2620,NOTE II,
2621,NOTE II,"The latter implies an equal capacity for pleasure, and thus the"
2622,NOTE II,balance is kept.
2623,NOTE II,
2624,NOTE II,Hâjî Abdû then proceeds to show that Faith is an accident of
2625,NOTE II,birth. One of his omitted distichs says:
2626,NOTE II,
2627,NOTE II,Race makes religion; true! but aye
2628,NOTE II,"upon the Maker acts the made,"
2629,NOTE II,"A finite God, and infinite sin,"
2630,NOTE II,"in lieu of raising man, degrade."
2631,NOTE II,
2632,NOTE II,In a manner of dialogue he introduces the various races each
2633,NOTE II,fighting to establish its own belief. The Frank (Christian)
2634,NOTE II,"abuses the Hindu, who retorts that he is of Mlenchha, mixed or"
2635,NOTE II,"impure, blood, a term applied to all non-Hindus. The same is done"
2636,NOTE II,"by Nazarene and Mohammedan; by the Confucian, who believes in"
2637,NOTE II,"nothing, and by the Soofi, who naturally has the last word. The"
2638,NOTE II,"association of the Virgin Mary and St. Joseph with the Trinity,"
2639,NOTE II,"in the Roman and Greek Churches, makes many Moslems conclude that"
2640,NOTE II,Christians believe not in three but in five Persons. So an
2641,NOTE II,"Englishman writes of the early Fathers, They not only said that"
2642,NOTE II,"3 = 1, and that 1 = 3: they professed to explain how that curious"
2643,NOTE II,arithmetical combination had been brought about. The Indivisible
2644,NOTE II,"had been divided, and yet was not divided: it was divisible, and"
2645,NOTE II,yet it was indivisible; black was white and white was black; and
2646,NOTE II,yet there were not two colours but one colour; and whoever did
2647,NOTE II,not believe it would be damned. The Arab quotation runs in the
2648,NOTE II,original:
2649,NOTE II,
2650,NOTE II,_Ahsanu l-Makâni l il-Fatâ l-Jehannamu_
2651,NOTE II,The best of places for (the generous) youth is Gehenna.
2652,NOTE II,
2653,NOTE II,"Gehenna, alias Jahim, being the fiery place of eternal"
2654,NOTE II,"punishment. And the second saying, _Al- nâr wa lâ l-Ar_Fire"
2655,NOTE II,"(of Hell) rather than Shame,is equally condemned by the"
2656,NOTE II,Koranist. The Gustâkhi (insolence) of Fate is the expression of
2657,NOTE II,Umar-i-Khayyam (St. xxx):
2658,NOTE II,
2659,NOTE II,"What, without asking hither hurried _whence?_"
2660,NOTE II,"And, without asking _whither_ hurried hence!"
2661,NOTE II,Oh many a cup of this forbidden wine
2662,NOTE II,Must drown the memory of that insolence.
2663,NOTE II,
2664,NOTE II,"Soofistically, the word means the coquetry of the beloved one,"
2665,NOTE II,the divinæ particula auræ. And the section ends with Popes:
2666,NOTE II,
2667,NOTE II,He cant be wrong whose life is in the right.

2671,CONCLUSION,CONCLUSION
2672,CONCLUSION,
2673,CONCLUSION,
2674,CONCLUSION,Here the Hâjî ends his practical study of mankind. The image of
2675,CONCLUSION,Destiny playing with men as pieces is a view common amongst
2676,CONCLUSION,Easterns. His idea of wisdom is once more Popes:
2677,CONCLUSION,
2678,CONCLUSION,And all our knowledge is ourselves to know.
2679,CONCLUSION,(Essay IV. 398.)
2680,CONCLUSION,
2681,CONCLUSION,"Regret, _i.e._, repentance, was one of the forty-two deadly sins"
2682,CONCLUSION,"of the Ancient Egyptians. Thou shalt not consume thy heart,"
2683,CONCLUSION,"says the Ritual of the Dead, the negative justification of the"
2684,CONCLUSION,soul or ghost (Lepsius Alteste Texte des Todtenbuchs). We have
2685,CONCLUSION,"borrowed competitive examination from the Chinese; and, in these"
2686,CONCLUSION,"morbid days of weak introspection and retrospection, we might"
2687,CONCLUSION,learn wisdom from the sturdy old Khemites. When he sings Abjure
2688,CONCLUSION,"the Why and seek the How, he refers to the old Scholastic"
2689,CONCLUSION,"difference of the _Demonstratio propter quid_ (why is a thing?),"
2690,CONCLUSION,as opposed to _Demonstratio quia_ (_i.e._ that a thing is). The
2691,CONCLUSION,"great Man shall end with becoming deathless, as Shakespeare"
2692,CONCLUSION,says in his noble sonnet:
2693,CONCLUSION,
2694,CONCLUSION,"And Death once dead, theres no more dying then!"
2695,CONCLUSION,
2696,CONCLUSION,"Like the great Pagans, the Hâjî holds that man was born good,"
