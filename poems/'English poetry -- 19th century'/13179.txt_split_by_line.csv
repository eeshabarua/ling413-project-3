178,AUTUMN,
179,AUTUMN,"Stilled is the virgin rapture that was June,"
180,AUTUMN,And cold is August's panting heart of fire;
181,AUTUMN,And in the storm-dismantled forest-choir
182,AUTUMN,For thine own elegy thy winds attune
183,AUTUMN,Their wild and wizard lyre:
184,AUTUMN,"And poignant grows the charm of thy decay,"
185,AUTUMN,"The pathos of thy beauty, and the sting,"
186,AUTUMN,Thou parable of greatness vanishing!
187,AUTUMN,"For me, thy woods of gold and skies of grey"
188,AUTUMN,With speech fantastic ring.

193,AUTUMN,From undiscoverable lips that blow
194,AUTUMN,An immaterial horn;
195,AUTUMN,"And spectral seem thy winter-boding trees,"
196,AUTUMN,Thy ruinous bowers and drifted foliage wet--
197,AUTUMN,"Past and Future in sad bridal met,"

432,A CHILD'S HAIR,
433,A CHILD'S HAIR,For Willie dwells where gentian flowers

435,A CHILD'S HAIR,And vineyards steeped in ardent hours
436,A CHILD'S HAIR,Slope to the wave
437,A CHILD'S HAIR,Where storied Chillon's tragic towers

442,A CHILD'S HAIR,And on the waters far below
443,A CHILD'S HAIR,Strange sails like wings
444,A CHILD'S HAIR,"Half-bodilessly come and go,"
445,A CHILD'S HAIR,Fantastic things;
446,A CHILD'S HAIR,

449,A CHILD'S HAIR,"And the far cataract's voice comes nigh,"
450,A CHILD'S HAIR,Where no man hears;
451,A CHILD'S HAIR,And spectral peaks impale the sky
452,A CHILD'S HAIR,On silver spears.
453,A CHILD'S HAIR,
454,A CHILD'S HAIR,"Ah, Willie, whose dissevered tress"
455,A CHILD'S HAIR,Lies in my hand!--may you possess

471,A CHILD'S HAIR,"The streams run dry,"

474,A CHILD'S HAIR,
475,A CHILD'S HAIR,"Dead as to captives grown supine,"
476,A CHILD'S HAIR,Chained to their task in sightless mine:

478,A CHILD'S HAIR,"Birds carol free,"

480,A CHILD'S HAIR,Leaps the glad sea;
481,A CHILD'S HAIR,
482,A CHILD'S HAIR,But they--their day and night are one.
483,A CHILD'S HAIR,"What is't to them, that rivulets run,"
484,A CHILD'S HAIR,Or what concern of theirs the sun?
485,A CHILD'S HAIR,It seems as though
486,A CHILD'S HAIR,Their business with these things was done
487,A CHILD'S HAIR,Ages ago:
488,A CHILD'S HAIR,
489,A CHILD'S HAIR,"Only, at times, each dulled heart feels"
490,A CHILD'S HAIR,"That somewhere, sealed with hopeless seals,"
491,A CHILD'S HAIR,"The unmeaning heaven about him reels,"
492,A CHILD'S HAIR,And he lies hurled
493,A CHILD'S HAIR,Beyond the roar of all the wheels
494,A CHILD'S HAIR,Of all the world.

499,A CHILD'S HAIR,To eyeless night in sunless lair
500,A CHILD'S HAIR,'Tis a far cry from Willie's hair;
501,A CHILD'S HAIR,And here it lies--
502,A CHILD'S HAIR,"Human, yet something which can ne'er"
503,A CHILD'S HAIR,Grow sad and wise:
504,A CHILD'S HAIR,
505,A CHILD'S HAIR,"Which, when the head where late it lay"
506,A CHILD'S HAIR,"In life's grey dusk itself is grey,"
507,A CHILD'S HAIR,And when the curfew of life's day
508,A CHILD'S HAIR,"By death is tolled,"

2286,IV,
2287,IV,"A hundred years ere he to manhood came,"
2288,IV,"Song from celestial heights had wandered down,"
2289,IV,"Put off her robe of sunlight, dew and flame,"
2290,IV,And donned a modish dress to charm the Town.
2291,IV,
2292,IV,Thenceforth she but festooned the porch of things;
2293,IV,"Apt at life's lore, incurious what life meant."
2294,IV,"Dextrous of hand, she struck her lute's few strings;"
2295,IV,"Ignobly perfect, barrenly content."
2296,IV,
2297,IV,"Unflushed with ardour and unblanched with awe,"
2298,IV,"Her lips in profitless derision curled,"
2299,IV,She saw with dull emotion--if she saw--
2300,IV,The vision of the glory of the world.
2301,IV,
2302,IV,"The human masque she watched, with dreamless eyes"
2303,IV,In whose clear shallows lurked no trembling shade:
2304,IV,"The stars, unkenned by her, might set and rise,"
2305,IV,"Unmarked by her, the daisies bloom and fade."
2306,IV,
2307,IV,The age grew sated with her sterile wit.
2308,IV,Herself waxed weary on her loveless throne.
2309,IV,"Men felt life's tide, the sweep and surge of it,"
2310,IV,"And craved a living voice, a natural tone."
2311,IV,
2312,IV,"For none the less, though song was but half true,"
2313,IV,"The world lay common, one abounding theme."
2314,IV,"Man joyed and wept, and fate was ever new,"
2315,IV,"And love was sweet, life real, death no dream."
2316,IV,
2317,IV,In sad stern verse the rugged scholar-sage
2318,IV,"Bemoaned his toil unvalued, youth uncheered."
2319,IV,"His numbers wore the vesture of the age,"
2320,IV,"But, 'neath it beating, the great heart was heard."
2321,IV,
2322,IV,"From dewy pastures, uplands sweet with thyme,"
2323,IV,A virgin breeze freshened the jaded day.
2324,IV,"It wafted Collins' lonely vesper-chime,"
2325,IV,It breathed abroad the frugal note of Gray.
2326,IV,
2327,IV,"It fluttered here and there, nor swept in vain"
2328,IV,"The dusty haunts where futile echoes dwell,--"
2329,IV,"Then, in a cadence soft as summer rain,"
2330,IV,"And sad from Auburn voiceless, drooped and fell."
2331,IV,
2332,IV,"It drooped and fell, and one 'neath northern skies,"
2333,IV,"With southern heart, who tilled his father's field,"
2334,IV,"Found Poesy a-dying, bade her rise"
2335,IV,And touch quick nature's hem and go forth healed.
2336,IV,
2337,IV,On life's broad plain the ploughman's conquering share
2338,IV,"Upturned the fallow lands of truth anew,"
2339,IV,And o'er the formal garden's trim parterre
2340,IV,The peasant's team a ruthless furrow drew.
2341,IV,
2342,IV,"Bright was his going forth, but clouds ere long"
2343,IV,"Whelmed him; in gloom his radiance set, and those"
2344,IV,"Twin morning stars of the new century's song,"
2345,IV,"Those morning stars that sang together, rose."
2346,IV,
2347,IV,In elvish speech the _Dreamer_ told his tale
2348,IV,Of marvellous oceans swept by fateful wings.--
2349,IV,"The _Seër_ strayed not from earth's human pale,"
2350,IV,But the mysterious face of common things
2351,IV,
2352,IV,He mirrored as the moon in Rydal Mere
2353,IV,"Is mirrored, when the breathless night hangs blue:"
2354,IV,"Strangely remote she seems and wondrous near,"
2355,IV,And by some nameless difference born anew.
2356,IV,

2358,V,V
2359,V,
2360,V,"Peace--peace--and rest! Ah, how the lyre is loth,"
2361,V,"Or powerless now, to give what all men seek!"
2362,V,Either it deadens with ignoble sloth
2363,V,"Or deafens with shrill tumult, loudly weak."
2364,V,
2365,V,Where is the singer whose large notes and clear
2366,V,Can heal and arm and plenish and sustain?
2367,V,"Lo, one with empty music floods the ear,"
2368,V,"And one, the heart refreshing, tires the brain."
2369,V,
2370,V,"And idly tuneful, the loquacious throng"
2371,V,"Flutter and twitter, prodigal of time,"
2372,V,And little masters make a toy of song
2373,V,Till grave men weary of the sound of rhyme.
2374,V,
2375,V,"And some go prankt in faded antique dress,"
2376,V,Abhorring to be hale and glad and free;
2377,V,"And some parade a conscious naturalness,"
2378,V,The scholar's not the child's simplicity.
2379,V,
2380,V,Enough;--and wisest who from words forbear.
2381,V,The kindly river rails not as it glides;
2382,V,"And suave and charitable, the winning air"
2383,V,"Chides not at all, or only him who chides."
2384,V,
2385,V,
2386,VI,VI
2387,VI,
2388,VI,Nature! we storm thine ear with choric notes.
2389,VI,"Thou answerest through the calm great nights and days,"
2390,VI,"""Laud me who will: not tuneless are your throats;"
2391,VI,"Yet if ye paused I should not miss the praise."""
2392,VI,
2393,VI,"We falter, half-rebuked, and sing again."
2394,VI,"We chant thy desertness and haggard gloom,"
2395,VI,"Or with thy splendid wrath inflate the strain,"
2396,VI,Or touch it with thy colour and perfume.
2397,VI,
2398,VI,"One, his melodious blood aflame for thee,"
2399,VI,"Wooed with fierce lust, his hot heart world-defiled."
2400,VI,"One, with the upward eye of infancy,"
2401,VI,"Looked in thy face, and felt himself thy child."
2402,VI,
2403,VI,Thee he approached without distrust or dread--
2404,VI,"Beheld thee throned, an awful queen, above--"
2405,VI,Climbed to thy lap and merely laid his head
2406,VI,Against thy warm wild heart of mother-love.
2407,VI,
2408,VI,He heard that vast heart beating--thou didst press
2409,VI,"Thy child so close, and lov'dst him unaware."
2410,VI,Thy beauty gladdened him; yet he scarce less
2411,VI,"Had loved thee, had he never found thee fair!"
2412,VI,
2413,VI,For thou wast not as legendary lands
2414,VI,To which with curious eyes and ears we roam.
2415,VI,"Nor wast thou as a fane mid solemn sands,"
2416,VI,Where palmers halt at evening. Thou wast home.
2417,VI,
2418,VI,"And here, at home, still bides he; but he sleeps;"
2419,VI,Not to be wakened even at thy word;
2420,VI,"Though we, vague dreamers, dream he somewhere keeps"
2421,VI,"An ear still open to thy voice still heard,--"
2422,VI,
2423,VI,"Thy voice, as heretofore, about him blown,"
2424,VI,For ever blown about his silence now;
2425,VI,"Thy voice, though deeper, yet so like his own"
2426,VI,"That almost, when he sang, we deemed 'twas thou!"
2427,VI,
2428,VI,
2429,VII,VII
2430,VII,
2431,VII,Behind Helm Crag and Silver Howe the sheen
2432,VII,Of the retreating day is less and less.
2433,VII,"Soon will the lordlier summits, here unseen,"
2434,VII,Gather the night about their nakedness.
2435,VII,
2436,VII,"The half-heard bleat of sheep comes from the hill,"
2437,VII,Faint sounds of childish play are in the air.
2438,VII,The river murmurs past. All else is still.
2439,VII,The very graves seem stiller than they were.
2440,VII,
2441,VII,"Afar though nation be on nation hurled,"
2442,VII,"And life with toil and ancient pain depressed,"
2443,VII,Here one may scarce believe the whole wide world
2444,VII,"Is not at peace, and all man's heart at rest."
2445,VII,
2446,VII,Rest! 'twas the gift _he_ gave; and peace! the shade
2447,VII,"_He_ spread, for spirits fevered with the sun."
2448,VII,To him his bounties are come back--here laid
2449,VII,"In rest, in peace, his labour nobly done."

2471,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),
2472,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Low, like another's, lies the laurelled head:"
2473,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),The life that seemed a perfect song is o'er:
2474,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Carry the last great bard to his last bed.
2475,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Land that he loved, thy noblest voice is mute."
2476,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Land that he loved, that loved him! nevermore"
2477,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Meadow of thine, smooth lawn or wild sea-shore,"
2478,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Gardens of odorous bloom and tremulous fruit,"
2479,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Or woodlands old, like Druid couches spread,"
2480,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),The master's feet shall tread.
2481,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Death's little rift hath rent the faultless lute:
2482,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),The singer of undying songs is dead.
2483,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),
2484,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Lo, in this season pensive-hued and grave,"
2485,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"While fades and falls the doomed, reluctant leaf"
2486,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"From withered Earth's fantastic coronal,"
2487,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),With wandering sighs of forest and of wave
2488,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Mingles the murmur of a people's grief
2489,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"For him whose leaf shall fade not, neither fall."
2490,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"He hath fared forth, beyond these suns and showers."
2491,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"For us, the autumn glow, the autumn flame,"
2492,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),And soon the winter silence shall be ours:
2493,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Him the eternal spring of fadeless fame
2494,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Crowns with no mortal flowers.
2495,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),
2496,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Rapt though he be from us,"
2497,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Virgil salutes him, and Theocritus;"
2498,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Catullus, mightiest-brained Lucretius, each"
2499,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Greets him, their brother, on the Stygian beach;"
2500,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Proudly a gaunt right hand doth Dante reach;
2501,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Milton and Wordsworth bid him welcome home;
2502,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Bright Keats to touch his raiment doth beseech;
2503,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Coleridge, his locks aspersed with fairy foam,"
2504,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Calm Spenser, Chaucer suave,"

2506,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"And godlike spirits hail him guest, in speech"
2507,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Of Athens, Florence, Weimar, Stratford, Rome."
2508,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),
2509,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"What needs his laurel our ephemeral tears,"
2510,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),To save from visitation of decay?

2512,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Blooms, nor to perishable mundane ears"
2513,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Sings he with lips of transitory clay;
2514,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),For he hath joined the chorus of his peers
2515,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),In habitations of the perfect day:
2516,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"His earthly notes a heavenly audience hears,"
2517,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"And more melodious are henceforth the spheres,"
2518,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Enriched with music stol'n from earth away.
2519,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),
2520,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),He hath returned to regions whence he came.
2521,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Him doth the spirit divine

2523,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),All nature is his shrine.
2524,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Seek him henceforward in the wind and sea,"

2526,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"In every star's august serenity,"
2527,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),And in the rapture of the flaming rose.
2528,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"There seek him if ye would not seek in vain,"
2529,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"There, in the rhythm and music of the Whole;"
2530,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Yea, and for ever in the human soul"
2531,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Made stronger and more beauteous by his strain.
2532,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),
2533,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"For lo! creation's self is one great choir,"
2534,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),And what is nature's order but the rhyme
2535,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Whereto the worlds keep time,"
2536,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),And all things move with all things from their prime?
2537,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Who shall expound the mystery of the lyre?
2538,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),In far retreats of elemental mind
2539,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Obscurely comes and goes
2540,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"The imperative breath of song, that as the wind"
2541,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Is trackless, and oblivious whence it blows."
2542,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Demand of lilies wherefore they are white,"
2543,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Extort her crimson secret from the rose,"
2544,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),But ask not of the Muse that she disclose
2545,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),The meaning of the riddle of her might:
2546,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Somewhat of all things sealed and recondite,"
2547,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Save the enigma of herself, she knows."
2548,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"The master could not tell, with all his lore,"
2549,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Wherefore he sang, or whence the mandate sped;"
2550,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Ev'n as the linnet sings, so I, he said;--"
2551,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Ah, rather as the imperial nightingale,"
2552,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"That held in trance the ancient Attic shore,"
2553,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),And charms the ages with the notes that o'er
2554,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),All woodland chants immortally prevail!
2555,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"And now, from our vain plaudits greatly fled,"
2556,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"He with diviner silence dwells instead,"
2557,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"And on no earthly sea with transient roar,"
2558,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Unto no earthly airs, he trims his sail,"
2559,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),But far beyond our vision and our hail
2560,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Is heard for ever and is seen no more.
2561,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),
2562,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"No more, O never now,"
2563,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Lord of the lofty and the tranquil brow
2564,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Whereon nor snows of time
2565,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Have fall'n, nor wintry rime,"
2566,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Shall men behold thee, sage and mage sublime."
2567,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Once, in his youth obscure,"
2568,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"The maker of this verse, which shall endure"
2569,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"By splendour of its theme that cannot die,"
2570,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Beheld thee eye to eye,"
2571,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),And touched through thee the hand
2572,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Of every hero of thy race divine,"
2573,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Ev'n to the sire of all the laurelled line,"
2574,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"The sightless wanderer on the Ionian strand,"
2575,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"With soul as healthful as the poignant brine,"
2576,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Wide as his skies and radiant as his seas,"
2577,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Starry from haunts of his Familiars nine,"
2578,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Glorious Mæonides.
2579,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Yea, I beheld thee, and behold thee yet:"
2580,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Thou hast forgotten, but can I forget?"
2581,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"The accents of thy pure and sovereign tongue,"
2582,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Are they not ever goldenly impressed
2583,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),On memory's palimpsest?
2584,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"I see the wizard locks like night that hung,"
2585,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),I tread the floor thy hallowing feet have trod;
2586,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"I see the hands a nation's lyre that strung,"
2587,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),The eyes that looked through life and gazed on God.
2588,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),
2589,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"The seasons change, the winds they shift and veer;"
2590,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),The grass of yesteryear
2591,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Is dead; the birds depart, the groves decay:"
2592,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Empires dissolve and peoples disappear:
2593,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Song passes not away.
2594,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Captains and conquerors leave a little dust,"
2595,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),And kings a dubious legend of their reign;
2596,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"The swords of Cæsars, they are less than rust:"
2597,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),The poet doth remain.
2598,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Dead is Augustus, Maro is alive;"
2599,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"And thou, the Mantuan of our age and clime,"
2600,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Like Virgil shalt thy race and tongue survive,"
2601,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Bequeathing no less honeyed words to time,"
2602,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"Embalmed in amber of eternal rhyme,"
2603,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),And rich with sweets from every Muse's hive;
2604,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),While to the measure of the cosmic rune
2605,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"For purer ears thou shalt thy lyre attune,"
2606,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),And heed no more the hum of idle praise
2607,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),"In that great calm our tumults cannot reach,"
2608,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),Master who crown'st our immelodious days
2609,(6TH OCTOBER 1892),With flower of perfect speech.

2699,THE DREAM OF MAN,Æons rolled behind him
2700,THE DREAM OF MAN,"With thunder of far retreat,"

2720,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Ev'n Asraël the King,"
2721,THE DREAM OF MAN,No more with Furies for heralds

2757,THE DREAM OF MAN,"The new evangel ran,"
2758,THE DREAM OF MAN,And an odour of world-wide incense
2759,THE DREAM OF MAN,Went up from Man unto Man;
2760,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Until, on a solemn feast-day,"
2761,THE DREAM OF MAN,When the world's usurping lord
2762,THE DREAM OF MAN,At a million impious altars
2763,THE DREAM OF MAN,"His own proud image adored,"
2764,THE DREAM OF MAN,God spake as He stept from His ambush:

2769,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Thereat, by the word of the Maker"
2770,THE DREAM OF MAN,The Spirit of Man was led
2771,THE DREAM OF MAN,"To a mighty peak of vision,"
2772,THE DREAM OF MAN,Where God to His creature said:
2773,THE DREAM OF MAN,"""Look eastward toward time's sunrise."""
2774,THE DREAM OF MAN,"And, age upon age untold,"
2775,THE DREAM OF MAN,The Spirit of Man saw clearly
2776,THE DREAM OF MAN,"The Past as a chart out-rolled,--"
2777,THE DREAM OF MAN,Beheld his base beginnings
2778,THE DREAM OF MAN,"In the depths of time, and his strife,"
2779,THE DREAM OF MAN,With beasts and crawling horrors
2780,THE DREAM OF MAN,"For leave to live, when life"

2792,THE DREAM OF MAN,In humbleness Man's Spirit
2793,THE DREAM OF MAN,At the feet of the Maker bent;

2801,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Am I that for ever grow."""
2802,THE DREAM OF MAN,"And God forbore to rebuke him,"
2803,THE DREAM OF MAN,"But answered brief and stern,"
2804,THE DREAM OF MAN,Bidding him toward time's sunset
2805,THE DREAM OF MAN,His vision westward turn;
2806,THE DREAM OF MAN,And the Spirit of Man obeying
2807,THE DREAM OF MAN,Beheld as a chart out-rolled
2808,THE DREAM OF MAN,"The likeness and form of the Future,"
2809,THE DREAM OF MAN,Age upon age untold;
2810,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Beheld his own meridian,"
2811,THE DREAM OF MAN,"And beheld his dark decline,"
2812,THE DREAM OF MAN,His secular fall to nadir
2813,THE DREAM OF MAN,"From summits of light divine,"

2817,THE DREAM OF MAN,Like a sputtering lamp to expire.
2818,THE DREAM OF MAN,
2819,THE DREAM OF MAN,Then a war of shame and anger
2820,THE DREAM OF MAN,Did the realm of his soul divide;
2821,THE DREAM OF MAN,"""'Tis false, 'tis a lying vision,"""
2822,THE DREAM OF MAN,In the face of his God he cried.
2823,THE DREAM OF MAN,"""Thou thinkest to daunt me with shadows;"

2836,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Ev'n thus Man turned from the Maker,"
2837,THE DREAM OF MAN,"With thundered defiance wild,"
2838,THE DREAM OF MAN,And God with a terrible silence
2839,THE DREAM OF MAN,Reproved the speech of His child.
2840,THE DREAM OF MAN,"And man returned to his labours,"
2841,THE DREAM OF MAN,And stiffened the neck of his will;
2842,THE DREAM OF MAN,"And the æons still went rolling,"
2843,THE DREAM OF MAN,And his power was crescent still.
2844,THE DREAM OF MAN,But yet there remained to conquer
2845,THE DREAM OF MAN,"One foe, and the greatest--although"
2846,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Despoiled of his ancient terrors,"
2847,THE DREAM OF MAN,"At heart, as of old, a foe--"
2848,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Unmaker of all, and renewer,"

2853,THE DREAM OF MAN,"And lo, Man mustered his forces"
2854,THE DREAM OF MAN,"The war of wars to wage,"

2856,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Did the foe of foes engage,"
2857,THE DREAM OF MAN,"And the Lord of Death, the undying,"
2858,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Was beset and harried sore,"
2859,THE DREAM OF MAN,In his immemorial fastness
2860,THE DREAM OF MAN,At night's aboriginal core.
2861,THE DREAM OF MAN,And during years a thousand
2862,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Man leaguered his enemy's hold,"
2863,THE DREAM OF MAN,"While nature was one deep tremor,"
2864,THE DREAM OF MAN,"And the heart of the world waxed cold,"
2865,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Till the phantom battlements wavered,"
2866,THE DREAM OF MAN,"And the ghostly fortress fell,"
2867,THE DREAM OF MAN,And Man with shadowy fetters
2868,THE DREAM OF MAN,Bound fast great Asraël.
2869,THE DREAM OF MAN,
2870,THE DREAM OF MAN,"So, to each star in the heavens,"
2871,THE DREAM OF MAN,"The exultant word was blown,"

2875,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Prolonging the jubilant tone,"
2876,THE DREAM OF MAN,"With hollow ingeminations,"
2877,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Sighed, _Death is overthrown!_"
2878,THE DREAM OF MAN,"And God in His house of silence,"
2879,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Where He dwelleth aloof, alone,"
2880,THE DREAM OF MAN,Paused in His tasks to hearken:
2881,THE DREAM OF MAN,_Death is overthrown!_
2882,THE DREAM OF MAN,
2883,THE DREAM OF MAN,Then a solemn and high thanksgiving
2884,THE DREAM OF MAN,"By Man unto Man was sung,"
2885,THE DREAM OF MAN,"In his temples of self-adoration,"
2886,THE DREAM OF MAN,With his own multitudinous tongue;
2887,THE DREAM OF MAN,"And he said to his Soul: ""Rejoice thou"

2890,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Unmade, disarmed, discrowned."""
2891,THE DREAM OF MAN,
2892,THE DREAM OF MAN,"And behold, his Soul rejoiced not,"
2893,THE DREAM OF MAN,"The breath of whose being was strife,"
2894,THE DREAM OF MAN,For life with nothing to vanquish
2895,THE DREAM OF MAN,Seemed but the shadow of life.
2896,THE DREAM OF MAN,No goal invited and promised

2910,THE DREAM OF MAN,"By mighty weariness vanquished,"
2911,THE DREAM OF MAN,And crowned with august despair.
2912,THE DREAM OF MAN,
2913,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Then, at his dreadful zenith,"
2914,THE DREAM OF MAN,"He cried unto God: ""O Thou"
2915,THE DREAM OF MAN,Whom of old in my days of striving
2916,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Methought I needed not,--now,"
2917,THE DREAM OF MAN,"In this my abject glory,"

2937,THE DREAM OF MAN,Undying Death new-born.
2938,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Sublime he rose in his fetters,"

2940,THE DREAM OF MAN,Ev'n as some mortal sleeper
2941,THE DREAM OF MAN,'Mid forests in autumntide

2943,THE DREAM OF MAN,The leaves that lightly fell
2944,THE DREAM OF MAN,On his limbs and his hair unheeded
2945,THE DREAM OF MAN,While as yet he slumbered well.
2946,THE DREAM OF MAN,
2947,THE DREAM OF MAN,"And Deity paused and hearkened,"
2948,THE DREAM OF MAN,"Then turned to the undivine,"

3632,PART THE FIRST,
3633,PART THE FIRST,"There was a time, it passeth me to say"
3634,PART THE FIRST,"How long ago, but sure 'twas many a day"
3635,PART THE FIRST,Before the world had gotten her such store
3636,PART THE FIRST,"Of foolish wisdom as she hath,--before"
3637,PART THE FIRST,She fell to waxing gray with weight of years
3638,PART THE FIRST,"And knowledge, bitter knowledge, bought with tears,--"
3639,PART THE FIRST,When it did seem as if the feet of time
3640,PART THE FIRST,"Moved to the music of a golden rhyme,"
3641,PART THE FIRST,And never one false thread might woven be
3642,PART THE FIRST,Athwart that web of worldwide melody.
3643,PART THE FIRST,"'Twas then there lived a certain queen and king,"
3644,PART THE FIRST,"Unvext of wars or other evil thing,"
3645,PART THE FIRST,"Within a spacious palace builded high,"
3646,PART THE FIRST,Whence they might see their chiefest city lie
3647,PART THE FIRST,"About them, and half hear from their tall towers"
3648,PART THE FIRST,"Its populous murmur through the daylight hours,"
3649,PART THE FIRST,And see beyond its walls the pleasant plain.
3650,PART THE FIRST,"One child they had, these blissful royal twain:"
3651,PART THE FIRST,Of whom 'tis told--so more than fair was he--
3652,PART THE FIRST,There lurked at whiles a something shadowy
3653,PART THE FIRST,Deep down within the fairness of his face;
3654,PART THE FIRST,"As 'twere a hint of some not-earthly grace,"
3655,PART THE FIRST,Making the royal stripling rather seem
3656,PART THE FIRST,The very dreaming offspring of a dream
3657,PART THE FIRST,Than human child of human ancestry:
3658,PART THE FIRST,"And something strange-fantastical was he,"
3659,PART THE FIRST,"I doubt not. Howsoever he upgrew,"
3660,PART THE FIRST,And after certain years to manhood drew
3661,PART THE FIRST,"Nigh, so that all about his father's court,"
3662,PART THE FIRST,"Seeing his graciousness of princely port,"
3663,PART THE FIRST,Rejoiced thereat; and many maidens' eyes
3664,PART THE FIRST,"Look'd pleased upon his beauty, and the sighs"
3665,PART THE FIRST,Of many told I know not what sweet tales.
3666,PART THE FIRST,
3667,PART THE FIRST,"So, like to some fair ship with sunlit sails,"
3668,PART THE FIRST,"Glided his youth amid a stormless sea,"
3669,PART THE FIRST,Till once by night there came mysteriously
3670,PART THE FIRST,"A fateful wind, and o'er an unknown deep"
3671,PART THE FIRST,Bore him perforce. It chanced that while in sleep
3672,PART THE FIRST,"He lay, there came to him a strange dim dream."
3673,PART THE FIRST,"'Twas like as he did float adown a stream,"
3674,PART THE FIRST,In a lone boat that had nor sail nor oar
3675,PART THE FIRST,"Yet seemed as it would glide for evermore,"
3676,PART THE FIRST,Deep in the bosom of a sultry land
3677,PART THE FIRST,Fair with all fairness. Upon either hand
3678,PART THE FIRST,"Were hills green-browed and mist-engarlanded,"
3679,PART THE FIRST,"And all about their feet were woods bespread,"
3680,PART THE FIRST,Hoarding the cool and leafy silentness
3681,PART THE FIRST,In many an unsunned hollow and hid recess.
3682,PART THE FIRST,Nought of unbeauteous might be there espied;
3683,PART THE FIRST,"But in the heart of the deep woods and wide,"
3684,PART THE FIRST,"And in the heart of all, was Mystery--"
3685,PART THE FIRST,"A something more than outer eye might see,"
3686,PART THE FIRST,A something more than ever ear might hear.
3687,PART THE FIRST,The very birds that came and sang anear
3688,PART THE FIRST,"Did seem to syllable some faery tongue,"
3689,PART THE FIRST,"And, singing much, to hold yet more unsung."
3690,PART THE FIRST,"And heard at whiles, with hollow wandering tone,"
3691,PART THE FIRST,"Far off, as by some aery huntsmen blown,"
3692,PART THE FIRST,"Faint-echoing horns, among the mountains wound,"
3693,PART THE FIRST,Made all the live air tremulous with sound.
3694,PART THE FIRST,
3695,PART THE FIRST,So hour by hour (thus ran the Prince's dream)
3696,PART THE FIRST,Glided the boat along the broadening stream;
3697,PART THE FIRST,"Till, being widowed of the sun her lord,"
3698,PART THE FIRST,The purblind day went groping evenward:
3699,PART THE FIRST,Whereafter Sleep compelled to his mild yoke
3700,PART THE FIRST,"The bubbling clear souls of the feathered folk,"
3701,PART THE FIRST,Sealing the vital fountains of their song.
3702,PART THE FIRST,Howbeit the Prince went onward all night long
3703,PART THE FIRST,"And never shade of languor came on him,"
3704,PART THE FIRST,Nor any weariness his eyes made dim.
3705,PART THE FIRST,And so in season due he heard the breath
3706,PART THE FIRST,Of the brief winds that wake ere darkness' death
3707,PART THE FIRST,Sigh through the woods and all the valley wide:
3708,PART THE FIRST,The rushes by the water answering sighed:
3709,PART THE FIRST,Sighed all the river from its reedy throat.
3710,PART THE FIRST,"And like a wingèd creature went the boat,"
3711,PART THE FIRST,"Over the errant water wandering free,"
3712,PART THE FIRST,As some lone seabird over a lone sea.
3713,PART THE FIRST,
3714,PART THE FIRST,And Morn pale-haired with watery wide eyes
3715,PART THE FIRST,"Look'd up. And starting with a swift surprise,"
3716,PART THE FIRST,"Sprang to his feet the Prince, and forward leant,"
3717,PART THE FIRST,His gaze on something right before him bent
3718,PART THE FIRST,"That like a towered and templed city showed,"
3719,PART THE FIRST,"Afar off, dim with very light, and glowed"
3720,PART THE FIRST,As burnished seas at sundawn when the waves
3721,PART THE FIRST,Make amber lightnings all in dim-roof'd caves
3722,PART THE FIRST,"That fling mock-thunder back. Long leagues away,"
3723,PART THE FIRST,"Down by the river's green right bank it lay,"
3724,PART THE FIRST,Set like a jewel in the golden morn:
3725,PART THE FIRST,"But ever as the Prince was onward borne,"
3726,PART THE FIRST,Nearer and nearer danced the dizzy fires
3727,PART THE FIRST,Of domes innumerable and sun-tipt spires
3728,PART THE FIRST,"And many a sky-acquainted pinnacle,"
3729,PART THE FIRST,Splendid beyond what mortal tongue may tell;
3730,PART THE FIRST,"And ere the middle heat of day was spent,"
3731,PART THE FIRST,"He saw, by nearness thrice-magnificent,"
3732,PART THE FIRST,Hardly a furlong's space before him lie
3733,PART THE FIRST,"The City, sloping to the stream thereby."
3734,PART THE FIRST,
3735,PART THE FIRST,And therewithal the boat of its own will
3736,PART THE FIRST,"Close to the shore began to glide, until,"
3737,PART THE FIRST,All of a sudden passing nigh to where
3738,PART THE FIRST,The glistering white feet of a marble stair
3739,PART THE FIRST,"Ran to the rippled brink, the Prince outsprang"
3740,PART THE FIRST,"Upon the gleamy steps, and wellnigh sang"
3741,PART THE FIRST,"For joy, to be once more upon his feet,"
3742,PART THE FIRST,Amid the green grass and the flowers sweet.
3743,PART THE FIRST,"So on he paced along the river-marge,"
3744,PART THE FIRST,"And saw full many a fair and stately barge,"
3745,PART THE FIRST,"Adorned with strange device and imagery,"
3746,PART THE FIRST,At anchor in the quiet waters lie.
3747,PART THE FIRST,And presently he came unto a gate
3748,PART THE FIRST,"Of massy gold, that shone with splendid state"
3749,PART THE FIRST,"Of mystic hieroglyphs, and storied frieze"
3750,PART THE FIRST,All overwrought with carven phantasies.
3751,PART THE FIRST,"And in the shadow of the golden gate,"
3752,PART THE FIRST,"One in the habit of a porter sate,"
3753,PART THE FIRST,"And on the Prince with wondering eye looked he,"
3754,PART THE FIRST,"And greeted him with reverent courtesy,"
3755,PART THE FIRST,"Saying, ""Fair sir, thou art of mortal race,"
3756,PART THE FIRST,"The first hath ever journeyed to this place,--"
3757,PART THE FIRST,"For well I know thou art a stranger here,"
3758,PART THE FIRST,As by the garb thou wearest doth appear;
3759,PART THE FIRST,"And if thy raiment do belie thee not,"
3760,PART THE FIRST,"Thou should'st be some king's son. And well I wot,"
3761,PART THE FIRST,"If that be true was prophesied of yore,"
3762,PART THE FIRST,A wondrous fortune is for thee in store;
3763,PART THE FIRST,"For though I be not read in Doomful Writ,"
3764,PART THE FIRST,"Oft have I heard the wise expounding it,"
3765,PART THE FIRST,"And, of a truth, the fatal rolls declare"
3766,PART THE FIRST,_That the first mortal who shall hither fare
3767,PART THE FIRST,"Shall surely have our Maiden-Queen to wife,"
3768,PART THE FIRST,"And while the world lives shall they twain have life. _"""
3769,PART THE FIRST,
3770,PART THE FIRST,"Hereat, be sure, the wonder-stricken youth,"
3771,PART THE FIRST,"Holden in doubt if this were lies or truth,"
3772,PART THE FIRST,"Was tongue-tied with amaze, and sore perplext,"
3773,PART THE FIRST,"Unknowing what strange thing might chance him next,"
3774,PART THE FIRST,"And ere he found fit words to make reply,"
3775,PART THE FIRST,The porter bade a youth who stood hard by
3776,PART THE FIRST,"Conduct the princely stranger, as was meet,"
3777,PART THE FIRST,"Through the great golden gate into the street,"
3778,PART THE FIRST,"And thence o'er all the city, wheresoe'er"
3779,PART THE FIRST,Was aught to show of wonderful or fair.
3780,PART THE FIRST,
3781,PART THE FIRST,"With that the Prince, beside his willing guide,"
3782,PART THE FIRST,"Went straightway through the gate, and stood inside"
3783,PART THE FIRST,"The wall, that, builded of a rare white stone,"
3784,PART THE FIRST,Clasp'd all the city like a silver zone.
3785,PART THE FIRST,"And thence down many a shining street they passed,"
3786,PART THE FIRST,"Each one appearing goodlier than the last,"
3787,PART THE FIRST,Cool with the presence of innumerous trees
3788,PART THE FIRST,And fountains playing before palaces.
3789,PART THE FIRST,"And whichsoever way the Prince might look,"
3790,PART THE FIRST,"Another marvel, and another, took"
3791,PART THE FIRST,His wildered eyes with very wonderment.
3792,PART THE FIRST,"And holding talk together as they went,"
3793,PART THE FIRST,The Prince besought his guide to tell him why
3794,PART THE FIRST,Of all the many folk that passed them by
3795,PART THE FIRST,"There was not one that had the looks of eld,"
3796,PART THE FIRST,Or yet of life's mid-years; for they beheld
3797,PART THE FIRST,"Only young men and maidens everywhere,"
3798,PART THE FIRST,Nor ever saw they one that was not fair.
3799,PART THE FIRST,"Whereat the stripling: ""Master, thou hast seen,"
3800,PART THE FIRST,"Belike, the river that doth flow between"
3801,PART THE FIRST,"Flowers and grasses at the city's feet?"""
3802,PART THE FIRST,"And when the Prince had rendered answer meet,"
3803,PART THE FIRST,"""Then,"" said the other, ""know that whosoe'er"
3804,PART THE FIRST,Drinks of the water thou beheldest there
3805,PART THE FIRST,(It matters not how many are his years)
3806,PART THE FIRST,Thenceforward from that moment he appears
3807,PART THE FIRST,"Like as he was in youthly days, before"
3808,PART THE FIRST,His passèd summers told beyond a score:
3809,PART THE FIRST,And so the people of this land possess
3810,PART THE FIRST,"Unto all time their youth and comeliness."""
3811,PART THE FIRST,
3812,PART THE FIRST,Scarce had his mouth made answer when there rose
3813,PART THE FIRST,"Somewhat of tumult, ruffling the repose"
3814,PART THE FIRST,Of the wide splendid street; and lifting up
3815,PART THE FIRST,"His eyes, the Prince beheld a glittering troop"
3816,PART THE FIRST,"Of horsemen, each upon a beauteous steed,"
3817,PART THE FIRST,Toward them coming at a gentle speed.
3818,PART THE FIRST,"And as the cavalcade came on apace,"
3819,PART THE FIRST,A sudden pleasure lit the stripling's face
3820,PART THE FIRST,Who bore him company and was his guide;
3821,PART THE FIRST,"And ""Lo, thou shalt behold our queen,"" he cried,--"
3822,PART THE FIRST,"""Even the fairest of the many fair;"
3823,PART THE FIRST,With whom was never maiden might compare
3824,PART THE FIRST,"For very loveliness!"" While yet he spake,"
3825,PART THE FIRST,On all the air a silver sound 'gan break
3826,PART THE FIRST,"Of jubilant and many-tongued acclaim,"
3827,PART THE FIRST,"And in a shining car the bright queen came,"
3828,PART THE FIRST,And looking forth upon the multitude
3829,PART THE FIRST,"Her eyes beheld the stranger where he stood,"
3830,PART THE FIRST,And round about him was the loyal stir:
3831,PART THE FIRST,And all his soul went out in love to her.
3832,PART THE FIRST,
3833,PART THE FIRST,"But even while her gaze met his, behold,"
3834,PART THE FIRST,The city and its marvels manifold
3835,PART THE FIRST,"Seemed suddenly removed far off, and placed"
3836,PART THE FIRST,Somewhere in Twilight; and withal a waste
3837,PART THE FIRST,Of sudden waters lay like time between;
3838,PART THE FIRST,And over all that space he heard the queen
3839,PART THE FIRST,Calling unto him from her chariot;
3840,PART THE FIRST,And then came darkness. And the Dream was not.
3841,PART THE FIRST,
3842,PART THE FIRST,
3843,PART THE SECOND,PART THE SECOND
3844,PART THE SECOND,
3845,PART THE SECOND,"A fearful and a lovely thing is Sleep,"
3846,PART THE SECOND,And mighty store of secrets hath in keep;
3847,PART THE SECOND,And those there were of old who well could guess
3848,PART THE SECOND,"What meant his fearfulness and loveliness,"
3849,PART THE SECOND,"And all his many shapes of life and death,"
3850,PART THE SECOND,And all the secret things he uttereth.
3851,PART THE SECOND,"But Wisdom lacketh sons like those that were,"
3852,PART THE SECOND,And Sleep hath never an interpreter:

3855,PART THE SECOND,
3856,PART THE SECOND,"And verily, of all the wondrous things"
3857,PART THE SECOND,By potence wrought of mortal visionings
3858,PART THE SECOND,In that dark house whereof Sleep hath the keys--
3859,PART THE SECOND,Of suchlike miracles and mysteries
3860,PART THE SECOND,"Not least, meseems, is this among them all:"
3861,PART THE SECOND,"That one in dream enamoured should fall,"
3862,PART THE SECOND,"And ever afterward, in waking thought,"
3863,PART THE SECOND,Worship the phantom which the dream hath brought.
3864,PART THE SECOND,"Howbeit such things have been, and in such wise"
3865,PART THE SECOND,"Did that king's son behold, with mortal eyes,"
3866,PART THE SECOND,"A more than mortal loveliness, and thus"
3867,PART THE SECOND,Was stricken through with love miraculous.
3868,PART THE SECOND,
3869,PART THE SECOND,For evermore thereafter he did seem
3870,PART THE SECOND,To see that royal maiden of his dream
3871,PART THE SECOND,Unto her palace riding sovranly;
3872,PART THE SECOND,And much he marvelled where that land might be
3873,PART THE SECOND,"That basking lay beneath her beauty's beams,"
3874,PART THE SECOND,Well knowing in his heart that suchlike dreams
3875,PART THE SECOND,Come not in idleness but evermore
3876,PART THE SECOND,Are Fate's veiled heralds that do fly before
3877,PART THE SECOND,"Their mighty master as he journeyeth,"
3878,PART THE SECOND,And sing strange songs of life and love and death.
3879,PART THE SECOND,And so he did scarce aught but dream all day
3880,PART THE SECOND,"Of that far land revealed of sleep, that lay"
3881,PART THE SECOND,He knew not where; and musing more and more
3882,PART THE SECOND,"On her the mistress of that unknown shore,"
3883,PART THE SECOND,"There fell a sadness on him, thus to be"
3884,PART THE SECOND,Vext with desire of her he might not see
3885,PART THE SECOND,Yet could not choose but long for; till erewhile
3886,PART THE SECOND,Nor man nor woman might behold the smile
3887,PART THE SECOND,"Make sudden morning of his countenance,"
3888,PART THE SECOND,"But likest one he seemed half-sunk, in trance,"
3889,PART THE SECOND,"That wanders groping in a shadowy land,"
3890,PART THE SECOND,Hearing strange things that none can understand.
3891,PART THE SECOND,"Now after many days and nights had passed,"
3892,PART THE SECOND,"The queen, his mother well-beloved, at last,"
3893,PART THE SECOND,"Being sad at heart because his heart was sad,"
3894,PART THE SECOND,Would e'en be told what hidden cause he had
3895,PART THE SECOND,To be cast down in so mysterious wise:
3896,PART THE SECOND,"And he, beholding by her tearful eyes"
3897,PART THE SECOND,"How of his grief she was compassionate,"
3898,PART THE SECOND,"No more a secret made thereof, but straight"
3899,PART THE SECOND,Discovered to her all about his dream--
3900,PART THE SECOND,The mystic happy marvel of the stream.
3901,PART THE SECOND,A fountain running Youth to all the land;
3902,PART THE SECOND,Flowing with deep dim woods on either hand
3903,PART THE SECOND,Where through the boughs did birds of strange song flit:
3904,PART THE SECOND,And all beside the bloomy banks of it
3905,PART THE SECOND,The city with its towers and domes far-seen.
3906,PART THE SECOND,And then he told her how that city's queen
3907,PART THE SECOND,"Did pass before him like a breathing flower,"
3908,PART THE SECOND,That he had loved her image from that hour.
3909,PART THE SECOND,"""And sure am I,"" upspake the Prince at last,"
3910,PART THE SECOND,"""That somewhere in this world so wide and vast"
3911,PART THE SECOND,Lieth the land mine eyes have inly seen;--
3912,PART THE SECOND,Perhaps in very truth my spirit hath been
3913,PART THE SECOND,"Translated thither, and in very truth"
3914,PART THE SECOND,Hath seen the brightness of that city of youth.
3915,PART THE SECOND,Who knows?--for I have heard a wise man say
3916,PART THE SECOND,"How that in sleep the souls of mortals may,"
3917,PART THE SECOND,"At certain seasons which the stars decree,"
3918,PART THE SECOND,From bondage of the body be set free
3919,PART THE SECOND,"To visit farthest countries, and be borne"
3920,PART THE SECOND,"Back to their fleshly houses ere the morn."""
3921,PART THE SECOND,
3922,PART THE SECOND,"At this the good queen, greatly marvelling,"
3923,PART THE SECOND,Made haste to tell the story to the king;
3924,PART THE SECOND,Who hearing laughed her tale to scorn. But when
3925,PART THE SECOND,"Weeks followed one another, and all men"
3926,PART THE SECOND,About his person had begun to say
3927,PART THE SECOND,"""What ails our Prince? He groweth day by day"
3928,PART THE SECOND,"Less like the Prince we knew ... wan cheeks, and eyes"
3929,PART THE SECOND,"Hollow for lack of sleep, and secret sighs...."
3930,PART THE SECOND,"Some hidden grief the youth must surely have,""--"
3931,PART THE SECOND,Then like his queen the king himself wox grave;
3932,PART THE SECOND,"And thus it chanced one summer eventide,"
3933,PART THE SECOND,"They sitting in an arbour side by side,"
3934,PART THE SECOND,"All unawares the Pince passed by that way,"
3935,PART THE SECOND,"And as he passed, unmark'd of either--they"
3936,PART THE SECOND,Nought heeding but their own discourse--could hear
3937,PART THE SECOND,"Amidst thereof his own name uttered clear,"
3938,PART THE SECOND,"And straight was 'ware it was the queen who spake,"
3939,PART THE SECOND,And spake of him; whereat the king 'gan make
3940,PART THE SECOND,"Answer in this wise, somewhat angerly:"
3941,PART THE SECOND,"""The youth is crazed, and but one remedy"
3942,PART THE SECOND,"Know I, to cure such madness--he shall wed"
3943,PART THE SECOND,"Some princess; ere another day be sped,"
3944,PART THE SECOND,Myself will bid this dreamer go prepare
3945,PART THE SECOND,To take whom I shall choose to wife; some fair
3946,PART THE SECOND,"And highborn maiden, worthy to be queen"
3947,PART THE SECOND,"Hereafter.""--So the Prince, albeit unseen,"
3948,PART THE SECOND,"Heard, and his soul rebelled against the thing"
3949,PART THE SECOND,His sire had willed; and slowly wandering
3950,PART THE SECOND,About the darkling pleasance--all amid
3951,PART THE SECOND,"A maze of intertangled walks, or hid"
3952,PART THE SECOND,"In cedarn glooms, or where mysterious bowers"
3953,PART THE SECOND,Were heavy with the breath of drowsèd flowers--
3954,PART THE SECOND,"Something, he knew not what, within his heart"
3955,PART THE SECOND,"Rose like a faint-heard voice and said ""Depart"
3956,PART THE SECOND,"From hence and follow where thy dream shall lead."""
3957,PART THE SECOND,"And fain would he have followed it indeed,"
3958,PART THE SECOND,But wist not whither it would have him go.
3959,PART THE SECOND,
3960,PART THE SECOND,"Howbeit, while yet he wandered to and fro,"
3961,PART THE SECOND,Among his thoughts a chance remembrance leapt
3962,PART THE SECOND,"All sudden--like a seed, that long hath slept"
3963,PART THE SECOND,"In earth, upspringing as a flower at last,"
3964,PART THE SECOND,When he that sowed forgetteth where 'twas cast;
3965,PART THE SECOND,A chance remembrance of the tales men told
3966,PART THE SECOND,Concerning one whose wisdom manifold
3967,PART THE SECOND,Made all the world to wonder and revere--
3968,PART THE SECOND,A mighty mage and learn'd astrologer
3969,PART THE SECOND,Who dwelt in honour at a great king's court
3970,PART THE SECOND,"In a far country, whither did resort"
3971,PART THE SECOND,"Pilgrims innumerable from many lands,"
3972,PART THE SECOND,Who crossed the wide seas and the desert sands
3973,PART THE SECOND,To learn of him the occult significance
3974,PART THE SECOND,"Of some perplexing omen, or perchance"
3975,PART THE SECOND,To hear forewhisperings of their destiny
3976,PART THE SECOND,And know what things in aftertime should be.
3977,PART THE SECOND,"""Now surely,"" thought the Prince, ""this subtile seer,"
3978,PART THE SECOND,"To whom the darkest things belike are clear,"
3979,PART THE SECOND,Could read the riddle of my dream and tell
3980,PART THE SECOND,Where lieth that strange land delectable
3981,PART THE SECOND,Wherein mine empress hath her dwelling-place.
3982,PART THE SECOND,"So might I look at last upon her face,"
3983,PART THE SECOND,"And make an end of all these weary sighs,"
3984,PART THE SECOND,"And melt into the shadow of her eyes!"""
3985,PART THE SECOND,"Thus musing, for a little space he stood"
3986,PART THE SECOND,"As holden to the spot; and evil, good,"
3987,PART THE SECOND,"Life, death, and earth beneath and heaven above,"
3988,PART THE SECOND,"Shrank up to less than shadows,--only Love,"
3989,PART THE SECOND,"With harpings of an hundred harps unseen,"
3990,PART THE SECOND,Filled all the emptiness where these had been.
3991,PART THE SECOND,
3992,PART THE SECOND,"But soon, like one that hath a sudden thought,"
3993,PART THE SECOND,"He lifted up his eyes, and turning sought"
3994,PART THE SECOND,"The halls once more where he was bred, and passed"
3995,PART THE SECOND,"Through court and corridor, and reached at last"
3996,PART THE SECOND,"His chamber, in a world of glimmer and gloom."
3997,PART THE SECOND,"Here, while the moonrays filled the wide rich room,"
3998,PART THE SECOND,The Prince in haste put off his courtly dress
3999,PART THE SECOND,For raiment of a lesser sumptuousness
4000,PART THE SECOND,(A sober habit such as might disguise
4001,PART THE SECOND,His royal rank in any stranger's eyes)
4002,PART THE SECOND,And taking in his hand three gems that made
4003,PART THE SECOND,"Three several splendours in the moonlight, laid"
4004,PART THE SECOND,"These in his bosom, where no eye might see"
4005,PART THE SECOND,The triple radiance; then all noiselessly
4006,PART THE SECOND,Down the wide stair from creaking floor to floor
4007,PART THE SECOND,"Passed, and went out from the great palace-door."
4008,PART THE SECOND,
4009,PART THE SECOND,"Crossing the spacious breadth of garden ground,"
4010,PART THE SECOND,Wherein his footfalls were the only sound
4011,PART THE SECOND,"Save the wind's wooing of the tremulous trees,"
4012,PART THE SECOND,Forth of that region of imperial ease
4013,PART THE SECOND,"He fared, amid the doubtful shadows dim,"
4014,PART THE SECOND,No eye in all the place beholding him;
4015,PART THE SECOND,"No eye, save only of the warders, who"
4016,PART THE SECOND,Opened the gates that he might pass therethrough.
4017,PART THE SECOND,
4018,PART THE SECOND,And now to the safe-keeping of the night
4019,PART THE SECOND,Intrusted he the knowledge of his flight;
4020,PART THE SECOND,"And quitting all the purlieus of the court,"
4021,PART THE SECOND,Out from the city by a secret port
4022,PART THE SECOND,"Went, and along the moonlit highway sped."
4023,PART THE SECOND,And himself spake unto himself and said
4024,PART THE SECOND,(Heard only of the silence in his heart)
4025,PART THE SECOND,"""Tarry thou here no longer, but depart"
4026,PART THE SECOND,Unto the land of the Great Mage; and seek
4027,PART THE SECOND,"The Mage; and whatsoever he shall speak,"
4028,PART THE SECOND,"Give ear to that he saith, and reverent heed;"
4029,PART THE SECOND,"And wheresoever he may bid thee speed,"
4030,PART THE SECOND,Thitherward thou shalt set thy face and go.
4031,PART THE SECOND,For surely one of so great lore must know
4032,PART THE SECOND,Where lies the land thou sawest in thy dream:
4033,PART THE SECOND,"Nay, if he know not that,--why, then I deem"
4034,PART THE SECOND,The wisdom of exceeding little worth
4035,PART THE SECOND,"That reads the heavens but cannot read the earth."""
4036,PART THE SECOND,
4037,PART THE SECOND,
4038,PART THE THIRD,PART THE THIRD
4039,PART THE THIRD,
4040,PART THE THIRD,"So without rest or tarriance all that night,"
4041,PART THE THIRD,"Until the world was blear with coming light,"
4042,PART THE THIRD,"Forth fared the princely fugitive, nor stayed"
4043,PART THE THIRD,His wearied feet till morn returning made
4044,PART THE THIRD,Some village all a-hum with wakeful stir;
4045,PART THE THIRD,And from that place the royal wayfarer
4046,PART THE THIRD,"Went ever faster on and yet more fast,"
4047,PART THE THIRD,"Till, ere the noontide sultriness was past,"
4048,PART THE THIRD,Upon his ear the burden of the seas
4049,PART THE THIRD,"Came dreamlike, heard upon a cool fresh breeze"
4050,PART THE THIRD,That tempered gratefully a fervent sky.
4051,PART THE THIRD,And many an hour ere sundown he drew nigh
4052,PART THE THIRD,"A fair-built seaport, warder of the land"
4053,PART THE THIRD,"And watcher of the wave, with odours fanned"
4054,PART THE THIRD,Of green fields and of blue from either side;--
4055,PART THE THIRD,"A pleasant place, wherein he might abide,"
4056,PART THE THIRD,"Unknown of man or woman, till such time"
4057,PART THE THIRD,As any ship should sail to that far clime
4058,PART THE THIRD,Where lived the famous great astrologer.
4059,PART THE THIRD,
4060,PART THE THIRD,"Entered within its gates, a wanderer"
4061,PART THE THIRD,"Besoiled with dust and no-wise richly drest,"
4062,PART THE THIRD,Yet therewithal a prince and princeliest
4063,PART THE THIRD,"Of princes, with the press of motley folk"
4064,PART THE THIRD,"He mixed unheeded and unknown, nor spoke"
4065,PART THE THIRD,"To any, no man speaking unto him,"
4066,PART THE THIRD,"But, being wearied sore in every limb,"
4067,PART THE THIRD,Sought out a goodly hostel where he might
4068,PART THE THIRD,Rest him and eat and tarry for the night:
4069,PART THE THIRD,And having eaten he arose and passed
4070,PART THE THIRD,Down to the wharves where many a sail and mast
4071,PART THE THIRD,Showed fiery-dark against the setting sun:
4072,PART THE THIRD,"There, holding talk with whom he chanced upon,"
4073,PART THE THIRD,In that same hour by great good hap he found
4074,PART THE THIRD,The master of a vessel outward-bound
4075,PART THE THIRD,Upon the morrow for that selfsame port
4076,PART THE THIRD,Whither he sought to go (where dwelt at court
4077,PART THE THIRD,The mage deep-read in starry charact'ry).
4078,PART THE THIRD,"An honest man and pleasant-tongued was he,"
4079,PART THE THIRD,This worthy master-mariner; and since
4080,PART THE THIRD,"He had no scorn of well-got gain, the Prince"
4081,PART THE THIRD,"Agreed to pay him certain sums in gold,"
4082,PART THE THIRD,"And go aboard his vessel, ere were told"
4083,PART THE THIRD,Two hours of sunlight on the coming day;
4084,PART THE THIRD,"And thus agreed they wended each his way,"
4085,PART THE THIRD,"For the dusk hour was nigh, and all the West"
4086,PART THE THIRD,Lay emptied of its sun. But as he pressed
4087,PART THE THIRD,Up the long seaward-sloping street that ran
4088,PART THE THIRD,"Through half the town, the Prince sought out a man"
4089,PART THE THIRD,Who dealt in pearls and diamonds and all
4090,PART THE THIRD,Manner of stones which men do precious call;
4091,PART THE THIRD,To whom the least of his three gems he sold
4092,PART THE THIRD,"For a great price, and laden with the gold"
4093,PART THE THIRD,Forthwith returned unto his hostelry
4094,PART THE THIRD,And dreamed all night of seaports and the sea.
4095,PART THE THIRD,
4096,PART THE THIRD,"Early the morrow-morn, a fair soft gale"
4097,PART THE THIRD,"Blowing from overland, the ship set sail"
4098,PART THE THIRD,At turning of the tide; and from her deck
4099,PART THE THIRD,"The Prince gazed till the town was but a speck,"
4100,PART THE THIRD,And all the shore became a memory:
4101,PART THE THIRD,"And still he gazed, though more he might not see"
4102,PART THE THIRD,Than the wide waters and the great wide sky.
4103,PART THE THIRD,And many a long unchangeful day went by
4104,PART THE THIRD,"Ere land was sighted, but at length uprose"
4105,PART THE THIRD,"A doubtful dusky something, toward the close"
4106,PART THE THIRD,Of the last hour before one sultry noon:
4107,PART THE THIRD,"Most like an isle of cloud it seemed, but soon"
4108,PART THE THIRD,"The sailors knew it for the wishèd strand,"
4109,PART THE THIRD,"And ere the evenfall they reached the land,"
4110,PART THE THIRD,And that same night the royal wanderer lay
4111,PART THE THIRD,"In a strange city, amid strange folk, till Day"
4112,PART THE THIRD,Rose from the dim sea's lap and with his wings
4113,PART THE THIRD,Fanned into wakefulness all breathing things.
4114,PART THE THIRD,
4115,PART THE THIRD,"Then he uprose, but going forth that morn"
4116,PART THE THIRD,"A sadness came upon him, and forlorn"
4117,PART THE THIRD,"He felt within himself, and nowise light"
4118,PART THE THIRD,Of heart: for all his lonely travel might
4119,PART THE THIRD,"Prove void and fruitless and of no avail,"
4120,PART THE THIRD,"(Thus pondered he) and should it wholly fail,"
4121,PART THE THIRD,What then were left him for to do? Return
4122,PART THE THIRD,"To his own country, that his kin might learn"
4123,PART THE THIRD,"To know him duped and fooled of fantasies,"
4124,PART THE THIRD,Blown hither and thither by an idle breeze
4125,PART THE THIRD,"From Dreamland? Or in lieu, perchance, of this,"
4126,PART THE THIRD,"Wander unresting, reft of hope and bliss,"
4127,PART THE THIRD,"A mariner on a sea that hath no coast,"
4128,PART THE THIRD,"Seeking a shade, himself a shade, and lost"
4129,PART THE THIRD,"In shadows, as a wave is lost i' the sea."
4130,PART THE THIRD,
4131,PART THE THIRD,"Thus in a heart not lightsome pondered he,"
4132,PART THE THIRD,"And roamed from unfamiliar street to street,"
4133,PART THE THIRD,Much marvelling that all he chanced to meet
4134,PART THE THIRD,Showed faces troubled as his own: for some
4135,PART THE THIRD,"Did weep outright, and over all a gloom"
4136,PART THE THIRD,"Hung, as a cloud that blotteth out the sun."
4137,PART THE THIRD,Wherefore the Prince addressed him unto one
4138,PART THE THIRD,"Of sadder visage even than the rest,"
4139,PART THE THIRD,"Who, ever as he walked, or beat his breast"
4140,PART THE THIRD,Or groaned aloud or with his fingers rent
4141,PART THE THIRD,"His robe, and, being besought to say what meant"
4142,PART THE THIRD,"This look of rue on all men's faces, cried"
4143,PART THE THIRD,"In loud amazement, ""What, can any abide"
4144,PART THE THIRD,"Within this city, having ears to hear,"
4145,PART THE THIRD,Yet know not how this morn the mighty seer
4146,PART THE THIRD,Hath died and left the land all desolate?
4147,PART THE THIRD,"For now, when sudden ills befall the state,"
4148,PART THE THIRD,There will be none to warn or prophesy
4149,PART THE THIRD,"As he, but when calamities are nigh"
4150,PART THE THIRD,No man will know till they be come and we
4151,PART THE THIRD,"Be all undone together, woe is me!"""
4152,PART THE THIRD,
4153,PART THE THIRD,Thus ended he his outcry and again
4154,PART THE THIRD,Passed on his way and mixed with other men
4155,PART THE THIRD,"Scarce joyfuller than he, if less they spake."
4156,PART THE THIRD,Meanwhile upon the Prince's heart there brake
4157,PART THE THIRD,"Grief like a bitter wind, beneath whose breath"
4158,PART THE THIRD,Hope paled and sickened well-nigh unto death:
4159,PART THE THIRD,"For lo, those dumb and formless fears that came"
4160,PART THE THIRD,"Within his heart that morn, and, like a flame"
4161,PART THE THIRD,"That flickers long and dimly ere it die,"
4162,PART THE THIRD,"Tarried and would not pass, but fitfully"
4163,PART THE THIRD,"Flickered and flared and paled and flared again,--"
4164,PART THE THIRD,"Lo, those mysterious messengers of pain,"
4165,PART THE THIRD,"Dumb formless fears, were they not verified?"
4166,PART THE THIRD,"And lo, that voyage o'er the waters wide,"
4167,PART THE THIRD,Was it not vain and a most empty thing?
4168,PART THE THIRD,"And what might now the years avail to bring,"
4169,PART THE THIRD,But hopes that barren live and barren die?
4170,PART THE THIRD,
4171,PART THE THIRD,Thus did his heart with many an inward sigh
4172,PART THE THIRD,"Ask of itself, though answer there was none"
4173,PART THE THIRD,"To be returned: and so the day, begun"
4174,PART THE THIRD,"Tristfully, trailed an ever wearier wing;"
4175,PART THE THIRD,Till toward night another questioning
4176,PART THE THIRD,Like a strange voice from far beset his soul:
4177,PART THE THIRD,And as a low wind wails for very dole
4178,PART THE THIRD,About a tarn whereof the listless wave
4179,PART THE THIRD,"Maketh no answer to its plaining, save"
4180,PART THE THIRD,"A sound that seems the phantom of its own,"
4181,PART THE THIRD,So that low voice making unbidden moan
4182,PART THE THIRD,"No answer got, saving the many sighs"
4183,PART THE THIRD,"Its echoes; and in this reproachful wise,"
4184,PART THE THIRD,"Heaping new pain on him disconsolate,"
4185,PART THE THIRD,"The low voice spake and spake, importunate:"
4186,PART THE THIRD,"_O Prince that wast and wanderer that art,"
4187,PART THE THIRD,Say doth love live within thy hidden heart
4188,PART THE THIRD,(Love born of dream but nurtured wakingly)
4189,PART THE THIRD,Ev'n as that Once when thy soul's eyes did see
4190,PART THE THIRD,"Love's visible self, and worshipt? Or hast thou"
4191,PART THE THIRD,"Fall'n from thy faith in Her and Love ere now,"
4192,PART THE THIRD,And is thy passion as a robe outworn?
4193,PART THE THIRD,"Nay, love forbid! Yet wherefore art thou lorn"
4194,PART THE THIRD,Of hope and peace if Love be still thine own?
4195,PART THE THIRD,"For, were the wondrous vision thou hast known"
4196,PART THE THIRD,Indeed Love's voice and Fate's (which are the same)
4197,PART THE THIRD,"Then, even as surely as the vision came,"
4198,PART THE THIRD,"So surely shall it be fulfilled, if faith"
4199,PART THE THIRD,Abide in thee; but if thy spirit saith
4200,PART THE THIRD,"Treason of Love or Fate, and unbelief"
4201,PART THE THIRD,"House in thy heart, then surely shall swift grief"
4202,PART THE THIRD,"Find thee, and hope (that should be as a breath"
4203,PART THE THIRD,"Of song undying) shall even die the death,"
4204,PART THE THIRD,"And thou thyself the death-in-life shalt see,"
4205,PART THE THIRD,"O Prince that wast, O wanderer that shalt be!_"
4206,PART THE THIRD,
4207,PART THE THIRD,So spake the Voice. And in the pauses of
4208,PART THE THIRD,"That secret Voice, there 'gan to wake and move,"
4209,PART THE THIRD,"Deep in his heart, a thing of blackest ill--"
4210,PART THE THIRD,"The shapeless shadow men call Doubt, until"
4211,PART THE THIRD,That hour all unacquainted with his soul:
4212,PART THE THIRD,"And being tormented sore of this new dole,"
4213,PART THE THIRD,There came on him a longing to explore
4214,PART THE THIRD,"That sleep-discovered flowery land once more,"
4215,PART THE THIRD,Isled in the dark of the soul; for he did deem
4216,PART THE THIRD,"That were he once again to dream The Dream,"
4217,PART THE THIRD,"His faith new-stablished would stand, and be"
4218,PART THE THIRD,No longer vext of this infirmity.
4219,PART THE THIRD,"And so that night, ere lying down to sleep,"
4220,PART THE THIRD,"There came on him, half making him to weep"
4221,PART THE THIRD,"And half to laugh that such a thing should be,"
4222,PART THE THIRD,A mad conceit and antic fantasy
4223,PART THE THIRD,(And yet more sad than merry was the whim)
4224,PART THE THIRD,"To crave this boon of Sleep, beseeching him"
4225,PART THE THIRD,To send the dream of dreams most coveted.
4226,PART THE THIRD,"And ere he lay him down upon his bed,"
4227,PART THE THIRD,A soft sweet song was born within his thought;
4228,PART THE THIRD,"But if he sang the song, or if 'twas nought"
4229,PART THE THIRD,"But the soul's longing whispered to the soul,"
4230,PART THE THIRD,"Himself knew hardly, while the passion stole"
4231,PART THE THIRD,"From that still depth where passion lieth prone,"
4232,PART THE THIRD,And voiced itself in this-like monotone:
4233,PART THE THIRD,
4234,PART THE THIRD,"""O Sleep, thou hollow sea, thou soundless sea,"
4235,PART THE THIRD,"Dull-breaking on the shores of haunted lands,"
4236,PART THE THIRD,"Lo, I am thine: do what thou wilt with me."
4237,PART THE THIRD,
4238,PART THE THIRD,"But while, as yet unbounden of thy bands,"
4239,PART THE THIRD,I hear the breeze from inland chide and chafe
4240,PART THE THIRD,"Along the margin of thy muttering sands,"
4241,PART THE THIRD,
4242,PART THE THIRD,"Somewhat I fain would crave, if thou vouchsafe"
4243,PART THE THIRD,"To hear mine asking, and to heed wilt deign."
4244,PART THE THIRD,"Behold, I come to fling me as a waif"

4246,PART THE THIRD,"Upon thy waters, O thou murmuring main!"
4247,PART THE THIRD,"So on some wasteful island cast not me,"
4248,PART THE THIRD,"Where phantom winds to phantom skies complain,"
4249,PART THE THIRD,
4250,PART THE THIRD,"And creeping terrors crawl from out the sea,"

4256,PART THE THIRD,Golden her city 'neath a heaven of gold!
4257,PART THE THIRD,
4258,PART THE THIRD,So may I see in dreams her tresses fair
4259,PART THE THIRD,"Down-falling, as a wave of sunlight rests"
4260,PART THE THIRD,"On some white cloud, about her shoulders bare,"
4261,PART THE THIRD,"Nigh to the snowdrifts twain which are her breasts."""
4262,PART THE THIRD,
4263,PART THE THIRD,"So ran the song,--say rather, so did creep,"
4264,PART THE THIRD,"With drowsy faltering feet unsure, till Sleep"
4265,PART THE THIRD,"Himself made end of it, with no rude touch"
4266,PART THE THIRD,Sealing the lips that babbled overmuch.
4267,PART THE THIRD,Howbeit the boon of boons most coveted
4268,PART THE THIRD,"Withholden was, and in that vision's stead"
4269,PART THE THIRD,"Another Dream from its dim hold uprose,"

4274,PART THE FOURTH,
4275,PART THE FOURTH,That night he dreamed that over him there stole
4276,PART THE FOURTH,"A change miraculous, whereby his soul"
4277,PART THE FOURTH,"Was parted from his body for a space,"
4278,PART THE FOURTH,And through a labyrinth of secret ways
4279,PART THE FOURTH,Entered the world where dead men's ghosts abide
4280,PART THE FOURTH,To seek the Seer who yestermorn had died.
4281,PART THE FOURTH,"And there in very truth he found the Seer,"
4282,PART THE FOURTH,"Who gazing on him said, ""What would'st thou here,"
4283,PART THE FOURTH,"O royal-born, who visitest the coasts"
4284,PART THE FOURTH,"Of darkness, and the dwellings of the ghosts?"""
4285,PART THE FOURTH,
4286,PART THE FOURTH,"Then said the Prince, ""I fain would know to find"
4287,PART THE FOURTH,The land as yet untrod of mortal-kind
4288,PART THE FOURTH,"Which I beheld by gracious leave of Sleep."""
4289,PART THE FOURTH,"To whom the Spirit: ""O Prince, the seas are deep"
4290,PART THE FOURTH,"And very wide betwixt thee and that land,"
4291,PART THE FOURTH,"And who shall say how many days do stand,"
4292,PART THE FOURTH,As dim-seen armed hosts between thy bliss
4293,PART THE FOURTH,"And thee?--Moreover, in the world there is"
4294,PART THE FOURTH,A certain Emerald Stone which some do call
4295,PART THE FOURTH,The Emerald of the Virtues Mystical;
4296,PART THE FOURTH,(Though what those Virtues Mystical may be
4297,PART THE FOURTH,"None living knows) and since, O youth, to me"
4298,PART THE FOURTH,"Thou dost apply for counsel, be it known"
4299,PART THE FOURTH,"Except thou have this wondrous emerald stone,"
4300,PART THE FOURTH,"Go seek through all the world, thou shalt not find"
4301,PART THE FOURTH,The land thou wouldst: but like the houseless wind
4302,PART THE FOURTH,"That roams the world to seek a resting-place,"
4303,PART THE FOURTH,Thou through inhospitable time and space
4304,PART THE FOURTH,"Shalt roam, till time and space deliver thee,"
4305,PART THE FOURTH,"To spaceless, timeless, mute eternity."
4306,PART THE FOURTH,
4307,PART THE FOURTH,"""For in a certain land there once did dwell"
4308,PART THE FOURTH,(How long ago it needs not I should tell)
4309,PART THE FOURTH,"At the king's court a great astrologer,"
4310,PART THE FOURTH,"Ev'n such as erst was I, but mightier"
4311,PART THE FOURTH,And far excelling; and it came to pass
4312,PART THE FOURTH,That he fell sick; and very old he was;
4313,PART THE FOURTH,"And knowing that his end was nigh, he said"
4314,PART THE FOURTH,"To him that sat in sorrow by his bed,"
4315,PART THE FOURTH,"'O master well-beloved and matchless king,"
4316,PART THE FOURTH,Take thou and keep this lowly offering
4317,PART THE FOURTH,In memory of thy servant;' whereupon
4318,PART THE FOURTH,The king perceived it was a gem that shone
4319,PART THE FOURTH,Like the sea's heart: and on one side of it
4320,PART THE FOURTH,This legend in an unknown tongue was writ--
4321,PART THE FOURTH,_Who holdeth Me may go where none hath fared
4322,PART THE FOURTH,"Before, and none shall follow afterward._"
4323,PART THE FOURTH,So the king took the bright green stone betwixt
4324,PART THE FOURTH,"His fingers, and upon the legend fixed"
4325,PART THE FOURTH,"His eyes, and said unto the dying Seer,"
4326,PART THE FOURTH,'Now who shall render this dark scripture clear
4327,PART THE FOURTH,That I may know the meaning of the gift?'
4328,PART THE FOURTH,And the mage oped his mouth and strove to lift
4329,PART THE FOURTH,"His voice, but could not, for the wishèd word"
4330,PART THE FOURTH,"Clave to his rattling throat, that no man heard:"
4331,PART THE FOURTH,"Whereby the soul, departing, bore away"
4332,PART THE FOURTH,"From all men living, even to this day,"
4333,PART THE FOURTH,The secret. And the jewel hath passed down
4334,PART THE FOURTH,"Seven times from sire to son, and in the crown"
4335,PART THE FOURTH,"It shineth of that country's kings, being called"
4336,PART THE FOURTH,Ev'n to this day the mystic emerald;
4337,PART THE FOURTH,"But no man liveth in the world, of wit"
4338,PART THE FOURTH,"To read the writing that is on it writ."""
4339,PART THE FOURTH,
4340,PART THE FOURTH,"""O Master,"" said the Prince, ""and wilt not thou"
4341,PART THE FOURTH,Instruct me where to find the king who now
4342,PART THE FOURTH,"Weareth the jewel in his diadem?"""
4343,PART THE FOURTH,"To whom the Spirit, ""O youth, and if the gem"
4344,PART THE FOURTH,"Be worth the finding, is't not also worth"
4345,PART THE FOURTH,The little pain of seeking through the earth?--
4346,PART THE FOURTH,"Yet so thou may'st not wander witlessly,"
4347,PART THE FOURTH,Look thou forget not this I tell to thee:
4348,PART THE FOURTH,When in thy journeyings thou shalt dream once more
4349,PART THE FOURTH,"The fateful dream thou haddest heretofore,"
4350,PART THE FOURTH,"That filled thy veins with longing as with wine,"
4351,PART THE FOURTH,Till all thy being brimm'd over--by that sign
4352,PART THE FOURTH,Thou mayest know thyself at last to be
4353,PART THE FOURTH,Within the borders of his empery
4354,PART THE FOURTH,"Who hath the mystic emerald stone, whose gleam"
4355,PART THE FOURTH,"Shall light thee to the country of thy dream."""
4356,PART THE FOURTH,
4357,PART THE FOURTH,"""But,"" said the Prince, ""When all the world's highways"
4358,PART THE FOURTH,"My feet have trod, till after length of days"
4359,PART THE FOURTH,"I reach the land where lies the wondrous stone,"
4360,PART THE FOURTH,"How shall I make so rare a, thing mine own?"
4361,PART THE FOURTH,"For had I riches more than could be told,"
4362,PART THE FOURTH,"What king would sell his jewels for my gold?"""
4363,PART THE FOURTH,And on this wise the answer of the Seer
4364,PART THE FOURTH,Fell in the hollow of his dreaming ear:
4365,PART THE FOURTH,"""Behold this Iron Chain,--of power it is"
4366,PART THE FOURTH,To heal all manner of mortal maladies
4367,PART THE FOURTH,"In him that wears it round his neck but once,"
4368,PART THE FOURTH,Between the sun's downgoing and the sun's
4369,PART THE FOURTH,"Uprising: take it thou, and hold it fast"
4370,PART THE FOURTH,Until by seeking long thou find at last
4371,PART THE FOURTH,The king that hath the mystic emerald stone:
4372,PART THE FOURTH,"And having found him, thou shalt e'en make known"
4373,PART THE FOURTH,The virtues lodged within this charmed chain:
4374,PART THE FOURTH,Which when the king doth hear he will be fain
4375,PART THE FOURTH,To have possession of so strange a thing;
4376,PART THE FOURTH,And thou shalt make a bargain with the king
4377,PART THE FOURTH,To give the Iron Chain in bartery
4378,PART THE FOURTH,For that mysterious jewel whereof he
4379,PART THE FOURTH,Knows not the secret worth. And when at last
4380,PART THE FOURTH,"The emerald stone in thy own hands thou hast,"
4381,PART THE FOURTH,Itself shall guide thee whither thou would'st go--
4382,PART THE FOURTH,"Ev'n to the land revealed of sleep, where no"
4383,PART THE FOURTH,"Grief comes to mar their music, neither sound"
4384,PART THE FOURTH,"Of sighing, while the golden years go round."""
4385,PART THE FOURTH,
4386,PART THE FOURTH,"So spake the Spirit unto him that dreamed,"
4387,PART THE FOURTH,And suddenly that world of shadow seemed
4388,PART THE FOURTH,More shadowy; and all things began to blend
4389,PART THE FOURTH,Together: and the dream was at an end.
4390,PART THE FOURTH,
4391,PART THE FOURTH,Then slept the Prince a deep sweet sleep that knew
4392,PART THE FOURTH,Nor dream nor vision; till the dawnlight grew
4393,PART THE FOURTH,"Up, and his soul a sudden halt did make"
4394,PART THE FOURTH,"About the confines dim of sleep and wake,"
4395,PART THE FOURTH,Where wandering lights and wildered shadows meet.
4396,PART THE FOURTH,But presently uprising to his feet
4397,PART THE FOURTH,"From tarriance in that frontier-region dim,"
4398,PART THE FOURTH,Exceeding wonderment laid hold on him;
4399,PART THE FOURTH,"For even while from off his bed he rose,"
4400,PART THE FOURTH,"He heard a clinking as of metal, close"
4401,PART THE FOURTH,"Thereby, and could in no-wise understand:"
4402,PART THE FOURTH,And lo the Iron Chain was in his hand!
4403,PART THE FOURTH,
4404,PART THE FOURTH,
4405,PART THE FIFTH,PART THE FIFTH
4406,PART THE FIFTH,
4407,PART THE FIFTH,"So, being risen, the Prince in brief while went"
4408,PART THE FIFTH,"Forth to the market-place, where babblement"
4409,PART THE FIFTH,Of them that bought and them that sold was one
4410,PART THE FIFTH,Of many sounds in murmurous union--
4411,PART THE FIFTH,"buzzing as of bees about their hives,"
4412,PART THE FIFTH,With shriller gossiping of garrulous wives
4413,PART THE FIFTH,Piping a tuneless treble thereunto:
4414,PART THE FIFTH,In midst whereof he went his way as who
4415,PART THE FIFTH,"Looketh about him well before he buys,"
4416,PART THE FIFTH,To mark the manner of their merchandise;
4417,PART THE FIFTH,Till chancing upon one who cried for sale
4418,PART THE FIFTH,"A horse, and seeing it well-limb'd and hale,"
4419,PART THE FIFTH,"And therewithal right goodly to behold,"
4420,PART THE FIFTH,"He bought the beast and paid the man in gold,"
4421,PART THE FIFTH,And having gotten him the needful gear
4422,PART THE FIFTH,"Rode from the market, nothing loth to hear"
4423,PART THE FIFTH,"Its garrulous wives no longer, and the din"
4424,PART THE FIFTH,Of them that daily bought and sold therein.
4425,PART THE FIFTH,"So from the place he passed, and slowly down"
4426,PART THE FIFTH,Street after street betook him till the town
4427,PART THE FIFTH,"Behind him and the gates before him were,"
4428,PART THE FIFTH,And all without was cornland greenly fair.
4429,PART THE FIFTH,
4430,PART THE FIFTH,"And through the cornland wending many a mile,"
4431,PART THE FIFTH,"And through the meadowland, he came erewhile"
4432,PART THE FIFTH,"To where the highways parted, and no man"
4433,PART THE FIFTH,Was nigh to tell him whitherward they ran;
4434,PART THE FIFTH,"But while he halted all in doubtful mood,"
4435,PART THE FIFTH,"An eagle, as if mourning for her brood"
4436,PART THE FIFTH,"Stolen, above him sped with rueful cry;"
4437,PART THE FIFTH,And when that he perceived the fowl to fly
4438,PART THE FIFTH,"Plaining aloud, unto himself he said,"
4439,PART THE FIFTH,"""Now shall yon mournful mother overhead"
4440,PART THE FIFTH,"Instruct the wandering of my feet, and they"
4441,PART THE FIFTH,"Shall follow where she leadeth:"" and away"
4442,PART THE FIFTH,"The bird went winging westward clamorously,"
4443,PART THE FIFTH,That westward even in her wake went he.
4444,PART THE FIFTH,And it may be that in his heart there stirred
4445,PART THE FIFTH,Some feeling as of fellowship with the bird;
4446,PART THE FIFTH,"For he, like her, was bound on a lone quest;"
4447,PART THE FIFTH,"And for his feet, as for her wings, no rest"
4448,PART THE FIFTH,"Might be, but only urgence of desire,"
4449,PART THE FIFTH,And one far goal that seemed not ever nigher.
4450,PART THE FIFTH,
4451,PART THE FIFTH,"So through that country wended he his way,"
4452,PART THE FIFTH,"Resting anights, till on the seventh day"
4453,PART THE FIFTH,"He passed unwares into another land,"
4454,PART THE FIFTH,Whose people's speech he could not understand--
4455,PART THE FIFTH,"A tract o'er-run with tribes barbarian,"
4456,PART THE FIFTH,And blood-red from the strife of man with man:
4457,PART THE FIFTH,And truly 'twas a thing miraculous
4458,PART THE FIFTH,"That one should traverse all that rude land thus,"
4459,PART THE FIFTH,"And no man rid him of his gold, nor raise"
4460,PART THE FIFTH,A hand to make abridgment of his days;
4461,PART THE FIFTH,But there was that about him could make men's
4462,PART THE FIFTH,"Hearts, ere they knew it, yield him reverence,--"
4463,PART THE FIFTH,"Perchance a sovran something in his eye,"
4464,PART THE FIFTH,"Whereat the fierce heart failed, it wist not why;--"
4465,PART THE FIFTH,Perchance that Fate which (hovering like a doubt
4466,PART THE FIFTH,"Athwart his being) hemmed him round about,"
4467,PART THE FIFTH,"Gloomed as a visible shadow across his way,"
4468,PART THE FIFTH,"And made men fearful. Be this as it may,"
4469,PART THE FIFTH,"No harm befell him in that land, and so"
4470,PART THE FIFTH,He came at last to where the ebb and flow
4471,PART THE FIFTH,Of other seas than he had wandered o'er
4472,PART THE FIFTH,Upflung to landward an attempered roar;
4473,PART THE FIFTH,"And wandering downward to the beach, he clomb"
4474,PART THE FIFTH,"To topmost of a tall grey cliff, wherefrom"
4475,PART THE FIFTH,"He saw a smoke as of men's houses, far"
4476,PART THE FIFTH,"Off, from a jutting point peninsular"
4477,PART THE FIFTH,Uprising: whence he deemed that there a town
4478,PART THE FIFTH,Must surely be. And so he clambered down
4479,PART THE FIFTH,"The cliff, and getting him again to horse"
4480,PART THE FIFTH,"Thither along the seabound held his course,"
4481,PART THE FIFTH,And reached that city about sunset-tide
4482,PART THE FIFTH,The smoking of whose hearths he had espied.
4483,PART THE FIFTH,
4484,PART THE FIFTH,"There at an hostel rested he, and there"
4485,PART THE FIFTH,Tarried the coming of the morn. But ere
4486,PART THE FIFTH,"He fell asleep that night, a wandering thought,"
4487,PART THE FIFTH,"Through darkling byeways of the spirit brought,"
4488,PART THE FIFTH,"Knock'd at his soul for entrance, whispering low"
4489,PART THE FIFTH,"""What if to-night thou dream The Dream, and know"
4490,PART THE FIFTH,"To-morrow, when thou wakest from that bliss,"
4491,PART THE FIFTH,The land wherein thou liest to be his
4492,PART THE FIFTH,"Who hath the mystic jewel in his keep?"""
4493,PART THE FIFTH,"So, full of flattering hope he fell asleep,"
4494,PART THE FIFTH,"And sleeping dreamed, but dreamed not that he would:"
4495,PART THE FIFTH,For at one time it seemed as if he stood
4496,PART THE FIFTH,"Alone upon a sterile neck of land,"
4497,PART THE FIFTH,Where round about him upon either hand
4498,PART THE FIFTH,"Was darkness, and the cry of a dark sea,"
4499,PART THE FIFTH,And worldwide vapours glooming thunderously;
4500,PART THE FIFTH,"And ever as he stood, the unstable ground"
4501,PART THE FIFTH,"Slid from beneath his feet with a great sound,"
4502,PART THE FIFTH,Till he could find no foothold anywhere
4503,PART THE FIFTH,That seemed not unsubstantial as the air.
4504,PART THE FIFTH,At otherwhiles he wandered all alone
4505,PART THE FIFTH,"About a lonely land, and heard a moan"
4506,PART THE FIFTH,As of some bird that sang and singing grieved;
4507,PART THE FIFTH,And peering all about the woods thick-leaved
4508,PART THE FIFTH,"If so he might espy the bird, he found"
4509,PART THE FIFTH,"At length, after long searching, that the sound"
4510,PART THE FIFTH,"Even from the bottom of his own heart came,"
4511,PART THE FIFTH,And unawares his own mouth sang the same.
4512,PART THE FIFTH,"And then in dream 'twas like as years went by,"
4513,PART THE FIFTH,"And still he journeyed, hardly knowing why,"
4514,PART THE FIFTH,"Till at the last a mist about him fell,"
4515,PART THE FIFTH,"And if the mist were death he could not tell,"
4516,PART THE FIFTH,For after that he knew no more. And so
4517,PART THE FIFTH,He slept until the cock began to crow.
4518,PART THE FIFTH,
4519,PART THE FIFTH,"Then came the gladful morn, that sendeth sick"
4520,PART THE FIFTH,"Dreams flying, and all shapes melàncholic"
4521,PART THE FIFTH,That vex the slumbers of the love-distraught.
4522,PART THE FIFTH,Unto his heart the merry morning brought
4523,PART THE FIFTH,"Cheer, and forewhisperings of some far-off rest,"
4524,PART THE FIFTH,When he should end in sweet that bitter quest.
4525,PART THE FIFTH,"But going forth that morn, and with his feet"
4526,PART THE FIFTH,"Threading the murmurous maze of street and street,"
4527,PART THE FIFTH,All strangely fell upon him everywhere
4528,PART THE FIFTH,The things he saw and heard of foul or fair.
4529,PART THE FIFTH,The thronging of the folk that filled the ways;
4530,PART THE FIFTH,The hubbub of the street and market-place;
4531,PART THE FIFTH,The sound of heavy wain-wheels on the stones;
4532,PART THE FIFTH,The comely faces and ill-favoured ones;
4533,PART THE FIFTH,The girls with apple-cheeks and hair of gold;
4534,PART THE FIFTH,The grey locks and the wrinkles of the old;--
4535,PART THE FIFTH,All these remote and unfamiliar
4536,PART THE FIFTH,"Seem'd, and himself a something from afar,"
4537,PART THE FIFTH,Looking at men as shadows on the wall
4538,PART THE FIFTH,And even the veriest shadow among them all.
4539,PART THE FIFTH,
4540,PART THE FIFTH,But now when all things dreamwise seemed to swim
4541,PART THE FIFTH,"About the dubious eyes and ears of him,"
4542,PART THE FIFTH,"That nothing in the world might be believed,"
4543,PART THE FIFTH,It chanced that on a sudden he perceived
4544,PART THE FIFTH,Where one that dealt in jewels sat within
4545,PART THE FIFTH,"His doorway, hearkening to the outer din,"
4546,PART THE FIFTH,As who cared no-wise to make fast his ears
4547,PART THE FIFTH,Against the babble of the street-farers:
4548,PART THE FIFTH,"Whereat the merchant, seeing a stranger pass,"
4549,PART THE FIFTH,"Guessed by his garb what countryman he was,"
4550,PART THE FIFTH,And giving him good-day right courteously
4551,PART THE FIFTH,Bespake him in his mother-tongue; for he
4552,PART THE FIFTH,Had wandered in his youth o'er distant seas
4553,PART THE FIFTH,And knew full many lands and languages.
4554,PART THE FIFTH,Wherefore with him the royal stranger fell
4555,PART THE FIFTH,"To talking cheerly, and besought him tell"
4556,PART THE FIFTH,"Whence all his gems were had and costly things,"
4557,PART THE FIFTH,"Talismans, amulets, and charmèd rings:"
4558,PART THE FIFTH,"Whereto the other answered, They had come"
4559,PART THE FIFTH,"Some from a country not far hence, and some"
4560,PART THE FIFTH,From out a land a thousand leagues away
4561,PART THE FIFTH,"To eastward, ev'n the birthplace of the Day,"
4562,PART THE FIFTH,The region of the sun's nativity;
4563,PART THE FIFTH,And giving ear to this right readily
4564,PART THE FIFTH,The Prince would fain be told of him the way
4565,PART THE FIFTH,To that far homeland of the youngling Day.
4566,PART THE FIFTH,"So, being ask'd, the other answered, ""Sir,"
4567,PART THE FIFTH,There liveth but one master-mariner
4568,PART THE FIFTH,Whose ship hath sailed so far: and that is he
4569,PART THE FIFTH,Who hither brought the jewels thou dost see.
4570,PART THE FIFTH,"And now, as luck will have it for the nonce,"
4571,PART THE FIFTH,He wills to voyage thitherward but once
4572,PART THE FIFTH,Before he die--for he is old like me--
4573,PART THE FIFTH,And even this day se'nnight saileth he.
4574,PART THE FIFTH,"Wherefore if thou be fain to see that land,"
4575,PART THE FIFTH,There needeth only gold within thy hand:
4576,PART THE FIFTH,"For gold, if that it jingle true and clear,"
4577,PART THE FIFTH,"Hath still a merry music for man's ear,"
4578,PART THE FIFTH,"And where is he that hateth sound of it?"""
4579,PART THE FIFTH,"So saying, the merchant bade the stranger sit,"
4580,PART THE FIFTH,"But the Prince thanked him for his courtesy,"
4581,PART THE FIFTH,And went his way. And that day se'nnight he
4582,PART THE FIFTH,"Was sailing toward the far-off morningland,"
4583,PART THE FIFTH,"And felt the skies about him like a band,"
4584,PART THE FIFTH,"And heard the low wind uttering numerous noise,"
4585,PART THE FIFTH,And all the great sea singing as one voice.
4586,PART THE FIFTH,
4587,PART THE FIFTH,
4588,PART THE SIXTH,PART THE SIXTH
4589,PART THE SIXTH,
4590,PART THE SIXTH,Even as one voice the great sea sang. From out
4591,PART THE SIXTH,"The green heart of the waters round about,"
4592,PART THE SIXTH,Welled as a bubbling fountain silverly
4593,PART THE SIXTH,The overflowing song of the great sea;
4594,PART THE SIXTH,"Until the Prince, by dint of listening long,"
4595,PART THE SIXTH,Divined the purport of that mystic song;
4596,PART THE SIXTH,(For so do all things breathe articulate breath
4597,PART THE SIXTH,Into his ears who rightly harkeneth)
4598,PART THE SIXTH,"And, if indeed he heard that harmony"
4599,PART THE SIXTH,"Aright, in this wise came the song of the sea:"
4600,PART THE SIXTH,
4601,PART THE SIXTH,"""Behold all ye that stricken of love do lie,"
4602,PART THE SIXTH,Wherefore in manacles of a maiden's eye
4603,PART THE SIXTH,Lead ye the life of bondmen and of slaves?
4604,PART THE SIXTH,Lo in the caverns and the depths of Me
4605,PART THE SIXTH,A thousand mermaids dwell beneath the waves:
4606,PART THE SIXTH,"A thousand maidens meet for love have I,"
4607,PART THE SIXTH,Ev'n I the virgin-hearted cold chaste sea.
4608,PART THE SIXTH,"Behold all ye that weary of life do lie,"
4609,PART THE SIXTH,There is no rest at all beneath the sky
4610,PART THE SIXTH,Save in the nethermost deepness of the deep.
4611,PART THE SIXTH,Only the silence and the midst of Me
4612,PART THE SIXTH,Can still the sleepless soul that fain would sleep;
4613,PART THE SIXTH,"For such, a cool death and a sweet have I,"
4614,PART THE SIXTH,Ev'n I the crystal-hearted cool sweet sea.
4615,PART THE SIXTH,"Behold all ye that in my lap do lie,"
4616,PART THE SIXTH,"To love is sweet and sweeter still to die,"
4617,PART THE SIXTH,And woe to him that laugheth me to scorn!
4618,PART THE SIXTH,Lo in a little while the anger of Me
4619,PART THE SIXTH,Shall make him mourn the day that he was born:
4620,PART THE SIXTH,"For in mine hour of wrath no ruth have I,"
4621,PART THE SIXTH,"Ev'n I the tempest-hearted pitiless sea."""
4622,PART THE SIXTH,
4623,PART THE SIXTH,"So sang the waters, if indeed 'twere they"
4624,PART THE SIXTH,"That sang unto the Prince's ears that day,"
4625,PART THE SIXTH,Since in the ship was not a soul besides
4626,PART THE SIXTH,Could hear that burden of the voiceful tides;
4627,PART THE SIXTH,"For when he told the sailors of this thing,"
4628,PART THE SIXTH,"And ev'n what words the waters seemed to sing,"
4629,PART THE SIXTH,"They stared astonishment, and some, that had"
4630,PART THE SIXTH,"More churlish souls than others, held him mad,"
4631,PART THE SIXTH,And laughed before his face outright. But when
4632,PART THE SIXTH,The captain heard the gossip of his men
4633,PART THE SIXTH,"Touching this marvel, the strange news begot"
4634,PART THE SIXTH,"No merry mood in him, who wist not what"
4635,PART THE SIXTH,"Should be the meaning of the miracle,"
4636,PART THE SIXTH,Nor whether 'twere an omen good or ill.
4637,PART THE SIXTH,Wherefore the old seafarer--having heard
4638,PART THE SIXTH,The tale retold with many an afterword
4639,PART THE SIXTH,The mariners' own most fruitful wit supplied
4640,PART THE SIXTH,"To grace the telling--took the Prince aside,"
4641,PART THE SIXTH,And ask'd him sundry questions privily
4642,PART THE SIXTH,Concerning this same singing of the sea.
4643,PART THE SIXTH,"So the Prince told him all there was to tell,"
4644,PART THE SIXTH,"And when that he had heard, the old man fell"
4645,PART THE SIXTH,"To meditating much, and shook his head"
4646,PART THE SIXTH,"As one exceeding ill at ease, and said,"
4647,PART THE SIXTH,"""I doubt the singing thou hast heard was no"
4648,PART THE SIXTH,"Voice of the waters billowing below,"
4649,PART THE SIXTH,"But rather of some evil spirit near,"
4650,PART THE SIXTH,"Who sought with singing to beguile thine ear,"
4651,PART THE SIXTH,Spreading a snare to catch the soul of thee
4652,PART THE SIXTH,"In meshes of entangling melody,"
4653,PART THE SIXTH,Which taketh captive the weak minds of men.
4654,PART THE SIXTH,"Therefore if thou should'st hear the sound again,"
4655,PART THE SIXTH,"Look thou content thee not with hearkening,"
4656,PART THE SIXTH,"But cast thine eyes around, and mark what thing"
4657,PART THE SIXTH,"Thou seëst, and let no man know but me."""
4658,PART THE SIXTH,
4659,PART THE SIXTH,So spake the white-haired wanderer of the sea.
4660,PART THE SIXTH,And on the morrow--when the sealine grew
4661,PART THE SIXTH,"O'erhazed with visible heat, and no wind blew,"
4662,PART THE SIXTH,And the half-stifled morning dropt aswoon
4663,PART THE SIXTH,Into the panting bosom of the noon--
4664,PART THE SIXTH,There came into the Prince's ears anew
4665,PART THE SIXTH,The song that yestermorn had hearkened to.
4666,PART THE SIXTH,And lifting up his eyes in hope to see
4667,PART THE SIXTH,What lips they were that made such melody
4668,PART THE SIXTH,"And filled him with the fulness of their sound,"
4669,PART THE SIXTH,He saw the sun at highest of his round
4670,PART THE SIXTH,"Show as a shield with one dark bloodstain blurred,"
4671,PART THE SIXTH,By reason of the body of some great bird
4672,PART THE SIXTH,"Like to an eagle, with wide wings outspread,"
4673,PART THE SIXTH,Athwart the sunfire hovering duskly red.
4674,PART THE SIXTH,So to the master of the ship he told
4675,PART THE SIXTH,"What he had witnessed, bidding him behold"
4676,PART THE SIXTH,The marvel with his own eyes if he would;
4677,PART THE SIXTH,"Who, though he strained his vision all he could,"
4678,PART THE SIXTH,Yet might not once endure to look the sun
4679,PART THE SIXTH,I' the face; and calling to him one by one
4680,PART THE SIXTH,"The whole ship's crew, he bade each mariner look"
4681,PART THE SIXTH,"Sunward who could, but no man's eyes might brook"
4682,PART THE SIXTH,The glare upon them of the noontide rays
4683,PART THE SIXTH,And lidless fervour of that golden gaze:
4684,PART THE SIXTH,So none of them beheld the bodeful bird.
4685,PART THE SIXTH,
4686,PART THE SIXTH,"Then said the greybeard captain, hardly heard"
4687,PART THE SIXTH,"Amid the babble of voices great and small,"
4688,PART THE SIXTH,"""The bird thou seëst is no bird at all,"
4689,PART THE SIXTH,But some unholy spirit in guise of one;
4690,PART THE SIXTH,And I do fear that we are all undone
4691,PART THE SIXTH,If any amongst us hearken to its voice;--
4692,PART THE SIXTH,"For of its mouth, I doubt not, was the noise"
4693,PART THE SIXTH,"Thou heardest as of dulcet carolling,"
4694,PART THE SIXTH,"When at thine ear the waters seemed to sing."""
4695,PART THE SIXTH,
4696,PART THE SIXTH,"And truly, many a wiser man than he"
4697,PART THE SIXTH,Herein had farther strayed from verity;
4698,PART THE SIXTH,For that great bird that seemed to fan the sun's
4699,PART THE SIXTH,Face with its wings was even the same as once
4700,PART THE SIXTH,"Flew screaming westward o'er the Prince's head,"
4701,PART THE SIXTH,Beguiling him to follow where it fled.
4702,PART THE SIXTH,"And bird it was not, but a spirit of ill,"
4703,PART THE SIXTH,"Man-hating, and of mankind hated still,"
4704,PART THE SIXTH,And slave to one yet mightier demon-sprite
4705,PART THE SIXTH,Whose dwelling is the shadow of the night.
4706,PART THE SIXTH,
4707,PART THE SIXTH,"So the days passed, and always on the next"
4708,PART THE SIXTH,The bird-sprite like a baleful vision vexed
4709,PART THE SIXTH,The happy-hearted sunlight; and each time
4710,PART THE SIXTH,Its false sweet song was wedded to the rhyme
4711,PART THE SIXTH,And chime of wind and wave--although it dropped
4712,PART THE SIXTH,As honey changed to music--the Prince stopped
4713,PART THE SIXTH,"His ears, and would not hear; and so the Sprite,"
4714,PART THE SIXTH,Seeing his charmèd songcraft of no might
4715,PART THE SIXTH,"Him to ensnare who hearkened not at all,"
4716,PART THE SIXTH,On the tenth day with dreadful noise let fall
4717,PART THE SIXTH,"A tempest shaken from the wings of him,"
4718,PART THE SIXTH,"Whereat the eyes of heaven wox thunderous-dim,"
4719,PART THE SIXTH,"Till the day-darkness blinded them, and fell"
4720,PART THE SIXTH,Holding the world in night unseasonable.
4721,PART THE SIXTH,And from his beakèd mouth the demon blew
4722,PART THE SIXTH,"A breath as of a hundred winds, and flew"
4723,PART THE SIXTH,"Downward aswoop upon the labouring bark,"
4724,PART THE SIXTH,"And, covered of the blear untimely Dark,"
4725,PART THE SIXTH,"Clutch'd with his gripple claws the Prince his prey,"
4726,PART THE SIXTH,"And backward through the tempest soared away,"
4727,PART THE SIXTH,Bearing that royal burden; and his eyes
4728,PART THE SIXTH,Were wandering wells of lightning to the skies.
4729,PART THE SIXTH,
4730,PART THE SIXTH,"Long time the Prince was held in swound, and knew"
4731,PART THE SIXTH,"Nor outer world nor inner, as they flew"
4732,PART THE SIXTH,From darkness unto darkness; till at last--
4733,PART THE SIXTH,"The fierce flight over, and his body cast"
4734,PART THE SIXTH,Somewhere alone in a strange place--the life
4735,PART THE SIXTH,"Stirred in him faintly, as at feeble strife"
4736,PART THE SIXTH,With covetous Death for ownership of him.
4737,PART THE SIXTH,And 'fore his eyes the world began to swim
4738,PART THE SIXTH,"All vague, and doubtful as a dream that lies"
4739,PART THE SIXTH,"Folded within another, petal-wise."
4740,PART THE SIXTH,And therewithal himself but half believed
4741,PART THE SIXTH,"His own eyes' testimony, and perceived"
4742,PART THE SIXTH,The things that were about him as who hears
4743,PART THE SIXTH,A distant music throbbing toward his ears
4744,PART THE SIXTH,"At noontide, in a flowery hollow of June,"
4745,PART THE SIXTH,And listens till he knows not if the tune
4746,PART THE SIXTH,"And he be one or twain, or near or far,"
4747,PART THE SIXTH,"But only feels that sound and perfume are,"
4748,PART THE SIXTH,And tremulous light and leafy umbrage: so
4749,PART THE SIXTH,"The Prince beheld unknowing, nor fain to know."
4750,PART THE SIXTH,
4751,PART THE SIXTH,"About him was a ruinous fair place,"
4752,PART THE SIXTH,"Which Time, who still delighteth to abase"
4753,PART THE SIXTH,"The highest, and throw down what men do build,"
4754,PART THE SIXTH,"With splendid prideful barrenness had filled,"
4755,PART THE SIXTH,"And dust of immemorial dreams, and breath"
4756,PART THE SIXTH,"Of silence, which is next of kin to death."
4757,PART THE SIXTH,"A weedy wilderness it seemed, that was"
4758,PART THE SIXTH,"In days forepast a garden, but the grass"
4759,PART THE SIXTH,"Grew now where once the flowers, and hard by"
4760,PART THE SIXTH,A many-throated fountain had run dry
4761,PART THE SIXTH,Which erst all day a web of rainbows wove
4762,PART THE SIXTH,Out of the body of the sun its love.
4763,PART THE SIXTH,"And but a furlong's space beyond, there towered"
4764,PART THE SIXTH,In middest of that silent realm deflowered
4765,PART THE SIXTH,"A palace builded of black marble, whence"
4766,PART THE SIXTH,The shadow of a swart magnificence
4767,PART THE SIXTH,"Falling, upon the outer space begot"
4768,PART THE SIXTH,A dream of darkness when the night was not.
4769,PART THE SIXTH,"Which while the Prince beheld, a wonderment"
4770,PART THE SIXTH,"Laid hold upon him, that he rose and went"
4771,PART THE SIXTH,"Toward the palace-portico apace,"
4772,PART THE SIXTH,Thinking to read the riddle of the place.
4773,PART THE SIXTH,And entering in (for open was the door)
4774,PART THE SIXTH,"From hall to hall he passed, from floor to floor,"
4775,PART THE SIXTH,"Through all the spacious house, and (saving where"
4776,PART THE SIXTH,The subtile spider had his darksome lair)
4777,PART THE SIXTH,No living creature could he find in it.
4778,PART THE SIXTH,"Howbeit, by certain writing that was writ"
4779,PART THE SIXTH,"Upon the wall of one dark room and bare,"
4780,PART THE SIXTH,He guessed that some great sorcerer had there
4781,PART THE SIXTH,"Inhabited, a slave to his own lust"
4782,PART THE SIXTH,"Of evil power and knowledge, till the dust"
4783,PART THE SIXTH,"Received his dust, and darkness had his soul;"
4784,PART THE SIXTH,But ere death took him he had willed the whole
4785,PART THE SIXTH,"Of his possessions to a Spirit of Ill,"
4786,PART THE SIXTH,"His sometime mate in commerce damnable,"
4787,PART THE SIXTH,"Making him lord of that high house, wherein"
4788,PART THE SIXTH,The twain had sealed their covenant of sin.
4789,PART THE SIXTH,
4790,PART THE SIXTH,"With that a horror smote the Prince, and fain"
4791,PART THE SIXTH,Would he have fled that evil spirit's domain
4792,PART THE SIXTH,And shook its dust from off his feet that hour.
4793,PART THE SIXTH,But from a window of the topmost tower
4794,PART THE SIXTH,"Viewing the dim-leaved wilderness without,"
4795,PART THE SIXTH,Full plainly he perceived it hemmed about
4796,PART THE SIXTH,"With waves, an island of the middle sea,"
4797,PART THE SIXTH,In watery barriers bound insuperably;
4798,PART THE SIXTH,"And human habitation saw he none,"
4799,PART THE SIXTH,Nor heard one bird a-singing in the sun
4800,PART THE SIXTH,To lighten the intolerable stress
4801,PART THE SIXTH,Of utter undisputed silentness.
4802,PART THE SIXTH,
4803,PART THE SIXTH,So by these signs he knew himself the thrall
4804,PART THE SIXTH,"Of that foul spirit unseen, and therewithal"
4805,PART THE SIXTH,"Wholly unfellowed in captivity,"
4806,PART THE SIXTH,Bound round with fetters of the tyrannous sea.
4807,PART THE SIXTH,"And sick for very loneliness, he passed"
4808,PART THE SIXTH,Downward through galleries and chambers vast
4809,PART THE SIXTH,To one wide hall wherefrom a vestibule
4810,PART THE SIXTH,"Opened into a dim green space and cool,"
4811,PART THE SIXTH,Where great trees grew that various fruitage bore
4812,PART THE SIXTH,"The like whereof he had not seen before,"
4813,PART THE SIXTH,And hard by was a well of water sweet;
4814,PART THE SIXTH,And being anhungered he did pluck and eat
4815,PART THE SIXTH,"The strange fair fruit, and being athirst did drink"
4816,PART THE SIXTH,"The water, and lay down beside the brink;"
4817,PART THE SIXTH,"Till sleep, as one that droppeth from the skies,"
4818,PART THE SIXTH,"Dropt down, and made a mist about his eyes."
4819,PART THE SIXTH,
4820,PART THE SIXTH,
4821,PART THE SEVENTH,PART THE SEVENTH
4822,PART THE SEVENTH,
4823,PART THE SEVENTH,"But Sleep, who makes a mist about the sense,"
4824,PART THE SEVENTH,"Doth ope the eyelids of the soul, and thence"
4825,PART THE SEVENTH,Lifteth a heavier cloud than that whereby
4826,PART THE SEVENTH,He veils the vision of the fleshly eye.
4827,PART THE SEVENTH,And not alone by dreams doth Sleep make known
4828,PART THE SEVENTH,The sealèd things and covert--not alone
4829,PART THE SEVENTH,In _visions_ of the night do mortals hear
4830,PART THE SEVENTH,The fatal feet and whispering wings draw near;
4831,PART THE SEVENTH,But dimly and in darkness doth the soul
4832,PART THE SEVENTH,"Drink of the streams of slumber as they roll,"
4833,PART THE SEVENTH,And win fine secrets from their waters deep:
4834,PART THE SEVENTH,"Yea, of a truth, the spirit doth grow in sleep."
4835,PART THE SEVENTH,
4836,PART THE SEVENTH,Howbeit I know not whether as he slept
4837,PART THE SEVENTH,A voice from out the depth of dream upleapt
4838,PART THE SEVENTH,And whispered in his ear; or whether he
4839,PART THE SEVENTH,"Grew to the knowledge blindly, as a tree"
4840,PART THE SEVENTH,"Waxes from bloom to fruitage, knowing not"
4841,PART THE SEVENTH,"The manner of its growth: but this I wot,"
4842,PART THE SEVENTH,That rising from that sleep beside the spring
4843,PART THE SEVENTH,The Prince had knowledge of a certain thing
4844,PART THE SEVENTH,Whereof he had not wist until that hour--
4845,PART THE SEVENTH,"To wit, that two contending spirits had power"
4846,PART THE SEVENTH,"Over _his_ spirit, ruling him with sway"
4847,PART THE SEVENTH,Altern; as 'twere dominion now of Day
4848,PART THE SEVENTH,"And now of Dark; for one was of the light,"
4849,PART THE SEVENTH,And one was of the blackness of the night.
4850,PART THE SEVENTH,
4851,PART THE SEVENTH,Now there be certain evil spirits whom
4852,PART THE SEVENTH,The mother of the darkness in her womb
4853,PART THE SEVENTH,Conceived ere darkness' self; and one of these
4854,PART THE SEVENTH,Did rule that island of the middle seas
4855,PART THE SEVENTH,Hemmed round with silence and enchantment dim.
4856,PART THE SEVENTH,Nothing in all the world so pleasured him
4857,PART THE SEVENTH,As filling human hearts with dolorousness
4858,PART THE SEVENTH,And banning where another sprite did bless;
4859,PART THE SEVENTH,But chiefly did his malice take delight
4860,PART THE SEVENTH,In thwarting lovers' hopes and breathing blight
4861,PART THE SEVENTH,Into the blossoms newly-openèd
4862,PART THE SEVENTH,"Of sweet desire, till all of sweet were fled:"
4863,PART THE SEVENTH,And (for he knew what secret hopes did fill
4864,PART THE SEVENTH,The minds of men) 'twas even now his will
4865,PART THE SEVENTH,"To step between the Prince and his desire,"
4866,PART THE SEVENTH,Nor suffer him to fare one furlong nigher
4867,PART THE SEVENTH,Unto that distant-shining golden goal
4868,PART THE SEVENTH,That beacon'd through the darkness to his soul.
4869,PART THE SEVENTH,
4870,PART THE SEVENTH,"And so the days, the sultry summer days,"
4871,PART THE SEVENTH,"Went by, and wimpled over with fine haze"
4872,PART THE SEVENTH,"The noiseless nights stole after them, as steals"
4873,PART THE SEVENTH,The moon-made shadow at some traveller's heels.
4874,PART THE SEVENTH,And day by day and night by night the Prince
4875,PART THE SEVENTH,"Dwelt in that island of enchantment, since"
4876,PART THE SEVENTH,"The hour when Evil Hap, in likeness of"
4877,PART THE SEVENTH,"An eagle swooping from the clouds above,"
4878,PART THE SEVENTH,Did bind him body and soul unto that place.
4879,PART THE SEVENTH,"And in due time the summer waxed apace,"
4880,PART THE SEVENTH,And in due time the summer waned: and now
4881,PART THE SEVENTH,"The withered leaf had fallen from the bough,"
4882,PART THE SEVENTH,And now the winter came and now the spring;
4883,PART THE SEVENTH,"Yea, summer's self was toward on the wing"
4884,PART THE SEVENTH,From wandering overseas: and all this while
4885,PART THE SEVENTH,"The Prince abode in that enchanted isle,"
4886,PART THE SEVENTH,Marvelling much at Fortune and her ways.
4887,PART THE SEVENTH,
4888,PART THE SEVENTH,And by degrees the slowly-sliding days
4889,PART THE SEVENTH,"Gathered themselves together into years,"
4890,PART THE SEVENTH,And oftentimes his spirit welled in tears
4891,PART THE SEVENTH,"From dawn to darkness and from dark to dawn,"
4892,PART THE SEVENTH,By reason of the light of life withdrawn.
4893,PART THE SEVENTH,"And if the night brought sleep, a fitful sleep,"
4894,PART THE SEVENTH,The phantoms of a buried time would creep
4895,PART THE SEVENTH,"Out of their hollow hiding-places vast,"
4896,PART THE SEVENTH,Peopling his Present from the wizard Past.
4897,PART THE SEVENTH,"Sometimes between the whirl of dream and dream,"
4898,PART THE SEVENTH,"All in a doubtful middle-world, a gleam"
4899,PART THE SEVENTH,"Went shivering past him through the chill grey space,"
4900,PART THE SEVENTH,"And lo he knew it for his mother's face,"
4901,PART THE SEVENTH,And wept; and all the silence where he stood
4902,PART THE SEVENTH,Wept with him. And at times the dreamer would
4903,PART THE SEVENTH,Dream himself back beneath his father's roof
4904,PART THE SEVENTH,"At eventide, and there would hold aloof"
4905,PART THE SEVENTH,"In silence, clothed upon with shadows dim,"
4906,PART THE SEVENTH,To hear if any spake concerning him;
4907,PART THE SEVENTH,"But the hours came and went and went and came,"
4908,PART THE SEVENTH,And no man's mouth did ever name his name.
4909,PART THE SEVENTH,And year by year he saw the queen and king
4910,PART THE SEVENTH,"Wax older, and beheld a shadowy thing"
4911,PART THE SEVENTH,"Lurking behind them, till it came between"
4912,PART THE SEVENTH,"His dreamsight and the semblance of the queen,"
4913,PART THE SEVENTH,From which time forth he saw her not: and when
4914,PART THE SEVENTH,"Another year had been it came again,"
4915,PART THE SEVENTH,And after that he saw his sire the king
4916,PART THE SEVENTH,"No more, by reason of the shadowy thing"
4917,PART THE SEVENTH,Stepping between; and all the place became
4918,PART THE SEVENTH,"As darkness, and the echo of a name."
4919,PART THE SEVENTH,
4920,PART THE SEVENTH,*       *       *       *       *
4921,PART THE SEVENTH,
4922,PART THE SEVENTH,What need to loiter o'er the chronicle
4923,PART THE SEVENTH,Of days that brought no change? What boots it tell
4924,PART THE SEVENTH,The tale of hours whereof each moment was
4925,PART THE SEVENTH,As like its fellow as one blade of grass
4926,PART THE SEVENTH,"Is to another, when the dew doth fall"
4927,PART THE SEVENTH,Without respect of any amongst them all?
4928,PART THE SEVENTH,Enow that time in that enchanted air
4929,PART THE SEVENTH,"Nor slept nor tarried more than otherwhere,"
4930,PART THE SEVENTH,And so at last the captive lived to see
4931,PART THE SEVENTH,The fiftieth year of his captivity.
4932,PART THE SEVENTH,And on a day within that fiftieth year
4933,PART THE SEVENTH,"He wandered down unto the beach, to hear"
4934,PART THE SEVENTH,"The breaking of the breakers on the shore,"
4935,PART THE SEVENTH,As he had heard them ofttimes heretofore
4936,PART THE SEVENTH,"In days when he would sit and watch the sea,"
4937,PART THE SEVENTH,If peradventure there some ship might be.
4938,PART THE SEVENTH,But now his soul no longer yearned as then
4939,PART THE SEVENTH,To win her way back to the world of men:
4940,PART THE SEVENTH,For what could now his freedom profit him?
4941,PART THE SEVENTH,The hope that filled youth's beaker to its brim
4942,PART THE SEVENTH,"The tremulous hand of age had long outspilled,"
4943,PART THE SEVENTH,And whence might now the vessel be refilled?
4944,PART THE SEVENTH,"Moreover, after length of days and years"
4945,PART THE SEVENTH,"The soul had ceased to beat her barriers,"
4946,PART THE SEVENTH,And like a freeborn bird that cagèd sings
4947,PART THE SEVENTH,Had grown at last forgetful of her wings.
4948,PART THE SEVENTH,
4949,PART THE SEVENTH,And so he took his way toward the sea--
4950,PART THE SEVENTH,"Not, as in former days, if haply he"
4951,PART THE SEVENTH,"Might spy some ship upon the nether blue,"
4952,PART THE SEVENTH,"And beckon with his hands unto the crew,"
4953,PART THE SEVENTH,But rather with an easeful heart to hear
4954,PART THE SEVENTH,What things the waves might whisper to his ear
4955,PART THE SEVENTH,Of counsel wise and comfortable speech.
4956,PART THE SEVENTH,"But while he walked about the yellow beach,"
4957,PART THE SEVENTH,"There came upon his limbs an heaviness,"
4958,PART THE SEVENTH,For languor of the sultry time's excess;
4959,PART THE SEVENTH,And so he lay him down under a tree
4960,PART THE SEVENTH,"Hard by a little cove, and there the sea"
4961,PART THE SEVENTH,"Sang him to sleep. And sleeping thus, he dreamed"
4962,PART THE SEVENTH,"A dream of very wonderment: himseemed,"
4963,PART THE SEVENTH,The spirit that half an hundred years before
4964,PART THE SEVENTH,In likeness of an eagle came and bore
4965,PART THE SEVENTH,"His body to that island on a day,"
4966,PART THE SEVENTH,"Came yet again and found him where he lay,"
4967,PART THE SEVENTH,And taking him betwixt his talons flew
4968,PART THE SEVENTH,"O'er seas and far-off countries, till they drew"
4969,PART THE SEVENTH,Nigh to a city that was built between
4970,PART THE SEVENTH,Four mountains in a pleasant land and green;
4971,PART THE SEVENTH,And there upon the highest mountain's top
4972,PART THE SEVENTH,The bird that was no bird at all let drop
4973,PART THE SEVENTH,"Its burthen, and was seen of him no more."
4974,PART THE SEVENTH,
4975,PART THE SEVENTH,"Thereat he waked, and issuing from the door"
4976,PART THE SEVENTH,Of dream did marvel in his heart; because
4977,PART THE SEVENTH,He found he had but dreamed the thing that was:
4978,PART THE SEVENTH,"For there, assuredly, was neither sea"
4979,PART THE SEVENTH,Nor Isle Enchanted; and assuredly
4980,PART THE SEVENTH,He sat upon the peak of a great hill;
4981,PART THE SEVENTH,"And far below him, looking strangely still,"
4982,PART THE SEVENTH,"Uptowered a city exceeding fair to ken,"
4983,PART THE SEVENTH,And murmurous with multitude of men.
4984,PART THE SEVENTH,
4985,PART THE SEVENTH,
4986,PART THE EIGHTH,PART THE EIGHTH
4987,PART THE EIGHTH,
4988,PART THE EIGHTH,"Now as it chanced, the day was almost spent"
4989,PART THE EIGHTH,"When down the lonely mountain-side he went,"
4990,PART THE EIGHTH,"The whitehaired man, the Prince that was; and ere"
4991,PART THE EIGHTH,He won the silence of the valley where
4992,PART THE EIGHTH,"The city's many towers uprose, the gate"
4993,PART THE EIGHTH,"Was closed against him, for the hour was late."
4994,PART THE EIGHTH,So even as they that have not wherewithal
4995,PART THE EIGHTH,"To roof them from the rain if it should fall,"
4996,PART THE EIGHTH,"Upon the grassy ground this king's son lay,"
4997,PART THE EIGHTH,And slept till nigh the coming of the day.
4998,PART THE EIGHTH,
4999,PART THE EIGHTH,But while as any vagabond he slept
5000,PART THE EIGHTH,"Or outcast from the homes of men, there crept"
5001,PART THE EIGHTH,Unto him lying in such sorry sort
5002,PART THE EIGHTH,A something fairer than the kingliest court
5003,PART THE EIGHTH,In all the peopled world had witness of--
5004,PART THE EIGHTH,"Even the shadow of the throne of Love,"
5005,PART THE EIGHTH,That from a height beyond all height did creep
5006,PART THE EIGHTH,Along the pavement of the halls of sleep.
5007,PART THE EIGHTH,O fair and wonderful! that shadow was
5008,PART THE EIGHTH,The golden dream of dreams that came across
5009,PART THE EIGHTH,"His youth, full half an hundred years before,"
5010,PART THE EIGHTH,And sent him wandering through the world. Once more
5011,PART THE EIGHTH,"In a lone boat that sails and oars had none,"
5012,PART THE EIGHTH,Midmost a land of summer and the sun
5013,PART THE EIGHTH,"Where nothing was that was not fair to see,"
5014,PART THE EIGHTH,"Adown a gliding river glided he,"
5015,PART THE EIGHTH,"And saw the city that was built thereby,"
5016,PART THE EIGHTH,"And saw the chariot of the queen draw nigh,"
5017,PART THE EIGHTH,And gazed upon her in the goodly street;
5018,PART THE EIGHTH,"Whereat he waked and rose upon his feet,"
5019,PART THE EIGHTH,"Remembering the Vision of the Seer,"
5020,PART THE EIGHTH,And what the spirit spake unto his ear:
5021,PART THE EIGHTH,"""When in thy wanderings thou shalt dream once more"
5022,PART THE EIGHTH,"The fateful dream thou haddest heretofore,"
5023,PART THE EIGHTH,That filled thy veins with longing as with wine
5024,PART THE EIGHTH,Till all thy being brimm'd over--by that sign
5025,PART THE EIGHTH,Thou mayest know thyself at last to be
5026,PART THE EIGHTH,Within the borders of his empery
5027,PART THE EIGHTH,"Who hath the mystic emerald stone, whose gleam"
5028,PART THE EIGHTH,"Shall light thee to the country of thy dream."""
5029,PART THE EIGHTH,
5030,PART THE EIGHTH,Then rose the heart within his heart and said:
5031,PART THE EIGHTH,"""O bitter scornful Fate, in days long dead"
5032,PART THE EIGHTH,I asked and thou denied'st mine asking: now
5033,PART THE EIGHTH,"The boon can no-wise profit me, and thou"
5034,PART THE EIGHTH,"Dost mock me with bestowal!"" Thereupon"
5035,PART THE EIGHTH,"He fell to thinking of his youthhood gone,"
5036,PART THE EIGHTH,"And wept. For now the goal, the longtime-sought,"
5037,PART THE EIGHTH,"Was even at hand, ""but how shall I,"" he thought,"
5038,PART THE EIGHTH,"""I that am old and sad and hoary-haired,"
5039,PART THE EIGHTH,Enter the place for youth and love prepared?
5040,PART THE EIGHTH,For in my veins the wellspring of desire
5041,PART THE EIGHTH,"Hath failed, and in mine heart the golden fire"
5042,PART THE EIGHTH,Burneth no more for ever. I draw near
5043,PART THE EIGHTH,"The night that is about our day, and hear"
5044,PART THE EIGHTH,The sighing of the darkness as I go
5045,PART THE EIGHTH,"Whose ancient secret there is none doth know."""
5046,PART THE EIGHTH,
5047,PART THE EIGHTH,"Ev'n so to his own heart he spake full sad,"
5048,PART THE EIGHTH,And many and bitter were the thoughts he had
5049,PART THE EIGHTH,Of days that were and days that were to be.
5050,PART THE EIGHTH,"But now the East was big with dawn, and he"
5051,PART THE EIGHTH,"Drew nigh the city-gates and entered in,"
5052,PART THE EIGHTH,Ere yet the place remurmured with the din
5053,PART THE EIGHTH,Of voices and the tread of human feet;
5054,PART THE EIGHTH,"And going up the void and silent street,"
5055,PART THE EIGHTH,"All in the chill gleam of the new-lit air,"
5056,PART THE EIGHTH,"A Thought found way into his soul, and there"
5057,PART THE EIGHTH,"Abode and grew, and in brief while became"
5058,PART THE EIGHTH,"Desire, and quickened to a quenchless flame:"
5059,PART THE EIGHTH,"And holding converse with himself, he said,"
5060,PART THE EIGHTH,"""Though in my heart the heart's desire be dead,"
5061,PART THE EIGHTH,And can no more these time-stilled pulses move;
5062,PART THE EIGHTH,Though Death were lovelier to these eyes than Love
5063,PART THE EIGHTH,"Yet would these eyes behold, or ere I pass,"
5064,PART THE EIGHTH,The land that mirror'd lay as in a glass
5065,PART THE EIGHTH,In the deep wells of dream. And her that is
5066,PART THE EIGHTH,"The sunlight of that city of all bliss,"
5067,PART THE EIGHTH,Her would I fain see once with waking eyes
5068,PART THE EIGHTH,Whom sleep hath rendered unto vision twice.
5069,PART THE EIGHTH,And having seen her beauty I would go
5070,PART THE EIGHTH,"My way, even to the river which doth flow"
5071,PART THE EIGHTH,From daylight unto darkness and the place
5072,PART THE EIGHTH,"Of silence, where the ghosts are face to face."""
5073,PART THE EIGHTH,
5074,PART THE EIGHTH,"So mused the man, and evermore his thought"
5075,PART THE EIGHTH,Gave him no peace. Wherefore next morn he sought
5076,PART THE EIGHTH,"The palace of the king, but on his way"
5077,PART THE EIGHTH,Tarried till nigh the middle of the day
5078,PART THE EIGHTH,In talk with certain of the city-folk;
5079,PART THE EIGHTH,"Whereby he learned, if that were true they spoke,"
5080,PART THE EIGHTH,How that the king their lord was nigh distract
5081,PART THE EIGHTH,With torture of a strange disease that racked
5082,PART THE EIGHTH,"Each day his anguished body more and more,"
5083,PART THE EIGHTH,Setting at naught the leeches and their lore.
5084,PART THE EIGHTH,"Which having heard he went before the king,"
5085,PART THE EIGHTH,"Who sat upon his throne, delivering"
5086,PART THE EIGHTH,"Judgment, his body pierced the while with pain."
5087,PART THE EIGHTH,And taking from his neck the charmèd chain
5088,PART THE EIGHTH,Which he had borne about him ever since
5089,PART THE EIGHTH,"That morn miraculous, the unknown Prince"
5090,PART THE EIGHTH,"Upspake and said, ""O king, I hold within"
5091,PART THE EIGHTH,My hand a wonder-working medicine
5092,PART THE EIGHTH,Of power to make thee whole if thou wilt deign
5093,PART THE EIGHTH,"So to be healèd;"" and he held the chain"
5094,PART THE EIGHTH,"Aloft, and straightway told unto the king"
5095,PART THE EIGHTH,The passing worth and wonder of the thing.
5096,PART THE EIGHTH,
5097,PART THE EIGHTH,Then he that heard stretched forth a hand that shook
5098,PART THE EIGHTH,"With sudden fever of half-hope, and took"
5099,PART THE EIGHTH,"The chain, and turned it over in his hand"
5100,PART THE EIGHTH,Until his eyes had left no link unscanned.
5101,PART THE EIGHTH,And on each separate link was character'd
5102,PART THE EIGHTH,"A language that no living ear had heard,"
5103,PART THE EIGHTH,"Occult, of secret import, mystic, strange."
5104,PART THE EIGHTH,"Then said the king, ""What would'st thou in exchange"
5105,PART THE EIGHTH,"For this the magic metal thou dost bring?"""
5106,PART THE EIGHTH,"And the Prince answered him and said, ""O king,"
5107,PART THE EIGHTH,Even the emerald stone which some do call
5108,PART THE EIGHTH,"The Emerald of the Virtues Mystical."""
5109,PART THE EIGHTH,And they who thronged the hall of judgment were
5110,PART THE EIGHTH,Astonished at the stranger who could dare
5111,PART THE EIGHTH,Ask such a boon; and some base mouths did curl
5112,PART THE EIGHTH,"With sneers, churl whispering to his fellow churl,"
5113,PART THE EIGHTH,"""Who could have deemed the man so covetous,"
5114,PART THE EIGHTH,"So void of shame in his great greed?"" For thus"
5115,PART THE EIGHTH,"It shall be ever underneath the sun,"
5116,PART THE EIGHTH,Each man believing that high hearts are none
5117,PART THE EIGHTH,Whose own is as the dust he treads on low.
5118,PART THE EIGHTH,
5119,PART THE EIGHTH,"But the king answered saying, ""Be it so."
5120,PART THE EIGHTH,To-night this chain of iron shall be worn
5121,PART THE EIGHTH,"About my neck, and on the morrow-morn,"
5122,PART THE EIGHTH,"If all the pain have left these limbs of mine,"
5123,PART THE EIGHTH,The guerdon thou demandest shall be thine.
5124,PART THE EIGHTH,"But if this torment still tormenteth me,"
5125,PART THE EIGHTH,"Thy head and shoulders shall part company,"
5126,PART THE EIGHTH,And both be cast uncoffin'd to the worms.
5127,PART THE EIGHTH,Open thy mouth and answer if these terms
5128,PART THE EIGHTH,"Content thee."" And aloud the Prince replied,"
5129,PART THE EIGHTH,"""With these conditions I am satisfied:"""
5130,PART THE EIGHTH,"Whereafter, rising from his knees, he went"
5131,PART THE EIGHTH,"Out from before the king, and was content."
5132,PART THE EIGHTH,
5133,PART THE EIGHTH,"Next morning, when the king awoke, I wis"
5134,PART THE EIGHTH,No heart was lighter in the land than his;
5135,PART THE EIGHTH,For all the grievous burden of his pains
5136,PART THE EIGHTH,"Had fall'n from off his limbs, and in his veins"
5137,PART THE EIGHTH,"Upleapt the glad new life, and the sick soul"
5138,PART THE EIGHTH,Seemed like its body all at once made whole.
5139,PART THE EIGHTH,But hardly was the king uprisen before
5140,PART THE EIGHTH,There knock'd and entered at the chamber-door
5141,PART THE EIGHTH,"His chief physician (a right skilful leech,"
5142,PART THE EIGHTH,"But given to hollow trickeries of speech,"
5143,PART THE EIGHTH,"And artful ways and wiles) who said, ""O king,"
5144,PART THE EIGHTH,"Be not deceived, I pray thee. One good thing"
5145,PART THE EIGHTH,"Comes of another, like from like. The weed"
5146,PART THE EIGHTH,"Beareth not lilies, neither do apes breed"
5147,PART THE EIGHTH,Antelopes. Thou art healed of thy pain
5148,PART THE EIGHTH,Not by the wearing of an iron chain--
5149,PART THE EIGHTH,"An iron chain forsooth!""--(hereat he laughed"
5150,PART THE EIGHTH,"As 'twere a huge rare jest) ""but by the draught"
5151,PART THE EIGHTH,Which I prepared for thee with mine own hands
5152,PART THE EIGHTH,From certain precious simples grown in lands
5153,PART THE EIGHTH,It irks me tell how many leagues away:
5154,PART THE EIGHTH,"Which medicine thou tookest yesterday."""
5155,PART THE EIGHTH,
5156,PART THE EIGHTH,"Then said the king, ""O false and jealous man,"
5157,PART THE EIGHTH,Who lovest better thine own praises than
5158,PART THE EIGHTH,Thy master's welfare! Little 'tis to such
5159,PART THE EIGHTH,"As thou, that I should be made whole; but much"
5160,PART THE EIGHTH,"That men should go before thee, trumpeting"
5161,PART THE EIGHTH,"""'Behold the man that cured our lord the king.'"""
5162,PART THE EIGHTH,And he was sore displeased and in no mood
5163,PART THE EIGHTH,To hearken. But the chief physician stood
5164,PART THE EIGHTH,"Unmoved amid this hail of kingly scorn,"
5165,PART THE EIGHTH,"With meek face martyr-like, as who hath borne"
5166,PART THE EIGHTH,"Much in the name of Truth, and much can bear."
5167,PART THE EIGHTH,And from the mouth of him false words and fair
5168,PART THE EIGHTH,So cunningly flowed that in a little while
5169,PART THE EIGHTH,"The royal frown became a royal smile,"
5170,PART THE EIGHTH,And the king hearkened to the leech and was
5171,PART THE EIGHTH,Persuaded. So that morn it came to pass
5172,PART THE EIGHTH,That when the Prince appeared before the throne
5173,PART THE EIGHTH,"To claim his rightful meed, the emerald stone,"
5174,PART THE EIGHTH,The king denied his title to receive
5175,PART THE EIGHTH,"The jewel, saying, ""Think'st thou I believe"
5176,PART THE EIGHTH,Yon jingling chain hath healed my body? Nay;
5177,PART THE EIGHTH,For whatsoever such as thou may say
5178,PART THE EIGHTH,I am not found so easy to beguile:
5179,PART THE EIGHTH,"As for the gem thou wouldest, this good while"
5180,PART THE EIGHTH,"It hath adorned the crown I wear, nor shall"
5181,PART THE EIGHTH,"The stone be parted from the coronal."""
5182,PART THE EIGHTH,
5183,PART THE EIGHTH,Scarce had the false king spoken when behold
5184,PART THE EIGHTH,Through the high ceiling's goodly fretted gold
5185,PART THE EIGHTH,A sudden shaft of lightning downward sped
5186,PART THE EIGHTH,"And smote the golden crown upon his head,"
5187,PART THE EIGHTH,"Yea, melted ev'n as wax the golden crown."
5188,PART THE EIGHTH,And from the molten metal there fell down
5189,PART THE EIGHTH,"A grassgreen Splendour, and the Emerald Stone"
5190,PART THE EIGHTH,"Tumbled from step to step before the throne,"
5191,PART THE EIGHTH,And lay all moveless at the Prince's feet!
5192,PART THE EIGHTH,And the king sat upon his royal seat
5193,PART THE EIGHTH,"A dead king, marble-mute: but no man stirred"
5194,PART THE EIGHTH,Or spake: and only silence might be heard.
5195,PART THE EIGHTH,
5196,PART THE EIGHTH,Then he before whose feet the gem did lie
5197,PART THE EIGHTH,"Said not a word to any man thereby,"
5198,PART THE EIGHTH,"But stooped and lifted it from off the floor,"
5199,PART THE EIGHTH,And passing outward from the open door
5200,PART THE EIGHTH,Put the mysterious jewel in his breast
5201,PART THE EIGHTH,"And went his way, none daring to molest"
5202,PART THE EIGHTH,"The stranger. For the whisper rose and ran,"
5203,PART THE EIGHTH,"""Is not the lightning leaguèd with this man?"""
5204,PART THE EIGHTH,
5205,PART THE EIGHTH,
5206,PART THE NINTH,PART THE NINTH
5207,PART THE NINTH,
5208,PART THE NINTH,And passing through the city he went out
5209,PART THE NINTH,"Into the fat fields lying thereabout,"
5210,PART THE NINTH,And lo the spirit of the emerald stone
5211,PART THE NINTH,With secret influence to himself unknown
5212,PART THE NINTH,"Guided the wandering of his errant feet,"
5213,PART THE NINTH,The servants of the errant soul; and sweet
5214,PART THE NINTH,"The meadows were, with babble of birds, and noise"
5215,PART THE NINTH,"Of brooks, the water's voice and the wind's voice."
5216,PART THE NINTH,Howbeit he gave small heed to any of them;
5217,PART THE NINTH,And now the subtile spirit of the gem
5218,PART THE NINTH,Led him along a winding way that ran
5219,PART THE NINTH,Beyond the fields to where the woods began
5220,PART THE NINTH,To spread green matwork for the mountains' feet;
5221,PART THE NINTH,A region where the Silence had her seat
5222,PART THE NINTH,And hearkened to the sounds that only she
5223,PART THE NINTH,Can hear--the fall of dew on herb and tree;
5224,PART THE NINTH,The voice of the growing of the grass; the night
5225,PART THE NINTH,Down-fluttering breathless from the heaven's height;
5226,PART THE NINTH,And autumn whispering unawares at times
5227,PART THE NINTH,"Strange secrets and dark sayings, wrapt in rhymes"
5228,PART THE NINTH,Wind-won from forest branches. At this place
5229,PART THE NINTH,"The old man rested for a little space,"
5230,PART THE NINTH,Forgetful that the day was wellnigh flown:
5231,PART THE NINTH,But soon the urgent spirit of the stone
5232,PART THE NINTH,Itself re-entered and possessed anew
5233,PART THE NINTH,"His soul; and led thereby, and wandering through"
5234,PART THE NINTH,"A mile of trackless and untrodden ground,"
5235,PART THE NINTH,By favour of the rising moon he found
5236,PART THE NINTH,"A rude path, broken here and there by rills"
5237,PART THE NINTH,Which crossed it as they hurried from the hills.
5238,PART THE NINTH,"And going whitherso the wild path went,"
5239,PART THE NINTH,"A two hours' journeying brought him, wellnigh spent"
5240,PART THE NINTH,"With toiling upwards, to a mountain pass,"
5241,PART THE NINTH,"A bleak lone place where no trees grew nor grass,"
5242,PART THE NINTH,"But on each hand a peak of rock, high-reared,"
5243,PART THE NINTH,Uprose: afar the two like horns appeared
5244,PART THE NINTH,"Of some great beast, so tapering-tall they were."
5245,PART THE NINTH,And now with forward gaze the wanderer
5246,PART THE NINTH,Stood where the pass was highest and the track
5247,PART THE NINTH,Went downward both ways; and behind his back
5248,PART THE NINTH,"The full moon shone, and lo before his face"
5249,PART THE NINTH,The bright sea glimmered at the mountain's base.
5250,PART THE NINTH,"It seemed, what way soever he might turn,"
5251,PART THE NINTH,His fate still led him to that watery bourn.
5252,PART THE NINTH,
5253,PART THE NINTH,"So journeying down the track which lay before,"
5254,PART THE NINTH,"He came, an hour past midnight, to the shore,"
5255,PART THE NINTH,"And, looking backward, far above espied"
5256,PART THE NINTH,"The two sharp peaks, one peak on either side"
5257,PART THE NINTH,Of that lone pass; verily like a pair
5258,PART THE NINTH,"Of monstrous horns, the tips far-seen, up there:"
5259,PART THE NINTH,"And in the nether space betwixt the two,"
5260,PART THE NINTH,A single monstrous eye the moon shone through.
5261,PART THE NINTH,
5262,PART THE NINTH,Now all this while the spirit of the stone
5263,PART THE NINTH,"Had led him forward, he, the old man lone,"
5264,PART THE NINTH,Taking no thought of whither he was bound.
5265,PART THE NINTH,And roaming now along the beach he found
5266,PART THE NINTH,"A creek, and in the creek, some little way"
5267,PART THE NINTH,"From where it joined the sea, a pinnace lay"
5268,PART THE NINTH,"Moored at the marge; and stepping thereinto,"
5269,PART THE NINTH,"He sat him down, and from his bosom drew"
5270,PART THE NINTH,"The mystic gem, and placed it at the prow,"
5271,PART THE NINTH,"That he might watch its paly splendours, how"
5272,PART THE NINTH,"They lightened here and there, and flashed aflame,"
5273,PART THE NINTH,Mocked at the moon and put the stars to shame.
5274,PART THE NINTH,"But hardly was the stone out of his hand,"
5275,PART THE NINTH,"When the boat wrenched her moorings from the land,"
5276,PART THE NINTH,And swift as any captive bird set free
5277,PART THE NINTH,"Shot o'er the shimmering surface of the sea,"
5278,PART THE NINTH,The spirit of the emerald guiding her;
5279,PART THE NINTH,And for a time the old man could not stir
5280,PART THE NINTH,For very greatness of astonishment.
5281,PART THE NINTH,
5282,PART THE NINTH,But merrily o'er the moonlit waters went
5283,PART THE NINTH,"The pinnace, till the land was out of sight,"
5284,PART THE NINTH,"Far in the dreaming distance. All that night,"
5285,PART THE NINTH,"Faster than ever wind in winter blew,"
5286,PART THE NINTH,"Faster than quarrel flies the bow, she flew."
5287,PART THE NINTH,A moment was a league in that wild flight
5288,PART THE NINTH,From vast to vast of ocean and the night.
5289,PART THE NINTH,And now the moon her lanthorn had withdrawn:
5290,PART THE NINTH,And now the pale weak heralds of the dawn
5291,PART THE NINTH,Lifted the lids of their blear eyes afar:
5292,PART THE NINTH,The last belated straggler of a star
5293,PART THE NINTH,Went home; and in her season due the morn
5294,PART THE NINTH,Brake on a cold and silent sea forlorn--
5295,PART THE NINTH,"A strange mute sea, where never wave hath stirred,"
5296,PART THE NINTH,"Nor sound of any wandering wind is heard,"
5297,PART THE NINTH,Nor voice of sailors sailing merrily:
5298,PART THE NINTH,"A sea untraversed, an enchanted sea"
5299,PART THE NINTH,From all the world fate-folden; hemmed about
5300,PART THE NINTH,Of linkèd Dreams; encompassed with a Doubt.
5301,PART THE NINTH,
5302,PART THE NINTH,"But not the less for lack of wind went she,"
5303,PART THE NINTH,"The flying pinnace, o'er that silent sea,"
5304,PART THE NINTH,Till those dull waters of enchantment lay
5305,PART THE NINTH,Behind her many a league. And now her way
5306,PART THE NINTH,"Was toward a shining tract of ocean, where"
5307,PART THE NINTH,"Low winds with bland breath flattered the mild air,"
5308,PART THE NINTH,"And low waves did together clasp and close,"
5309,PART THE NINTH,And skyward yearning from the sea there rose
5310,PART THE NINTH,And seaward yearning from the sky there fell
5311,PART THE NINTH,A Spirit of Deep Content Unspeakable:
5312,PART THE NINTH,"So midway meeting betwixt sky and sea,"
5313,PART THE NINTH,"These twain are married for eternity,"
5314,PART THE NINTH,"And rule the spirits of that Deep, and share"
5315,PART THE NINTH,The lordship of the legions of the air.
5316,PART THE NINTH,
5317,PART THE NINTH,Here winds but came to rest them from their wars
5318,PART THE NINTH,With far seas waged. Here Darkness had her stars
5319,PART THE NINTH,"Always, a nightly multitudinous birth."
5320,PART THE NINTH,"And entering on this happier zone of earth,"
5321,PART THE NINTH,"The boat 'gan bate her speed, and by degrees"
5322,PART THE NINTH,"Tempered her motion to the tranquil seas,"
5323,PART THE NINTH,"As if she knew the land not far ahead,"
5324,PART THE NINTH,The port not far: so forward piloted
5325,PART THE NINTH,"By that sweet spirit and strong, she held her way"
5326,PART THE NINTH,"Unveering. And a little past midday,"
5327,PART THE NINTH,"The wanderer lifted up his eyes, and right"
5328,PART THE NINTH,"Before him saw what seemed a great wall, white"
5329,PART THE NINTH,"As alabaster, builded o'er the sea,"
5330,PART THE NINTH,High as the heaven; but drawing nearer he
5331,PART THE NINTH,Perceived it was a mighty mist that lay
5332,PART THE NINTH,"Upon the ocean, stretching far away"
5333,PART THE NINTH,"Northward and southward, and the sun appeared"
5334,PART THE NINTH,Powerless to melt its mass. And while he neared
5335,PART THE NINTH,"This cloudy barrier stretching north and south,"
5336,PART THE NINTH,"A tale once told him by his mother's mouth,"
5337,PART THE NINTH,"In childhood, while he sat upon her knee,"
5338,PART THE NINTH,Rose to remembrance: _how that on the sea.
5339,PART THE NINTH,Sat somewhere a Great Mist which no sun's heat
5340,PART THE NINTH,"Could melt, nor wind make wander from, its seat."
5341,PART THE NINTH,"So great it was, the fastest ship would need"
5342,PART THE NINTH,"Seven days to compass it, with all her speed."
5343,PART THE NINTH,And they of deepest lore and wisest wit
5344,PART THE NINTH,Deemed that an island in the midst of it
5345,PART THE NINTH,"Bloomed like a rosebush ring'd with snows, a place"
5346,PART THE NINTH,"Of pleasance, folded in that white embrace"
5347,PART THE NINTH,And chill. But never yet would pilot steer
5348,PART THE NINTH,"Into the fog that wrapped it round, for fear"
5349,PART THE NINTH,Of running blindfold in that sightless mist
5350,PART THE NINTH,On sunken reefs whereof no mariner wist:
5351,PART THE NINTH,And so from all the world this happy isle
5352,PART THE NINTH,"Lay hidden_. Thus the queen, long since; and while"
5353,PART THE NINTH,He marvelled if the mist before his ken
5354,PART THE NINTH,"Could be the same she told of--even then,"
5355,PART THE NINTH,Hardly a furlong 'fore the pinnace' prow
5356,PART THE NINTH,It lay: and now 'twas hard at hand: and now
5357,PART THE NINTH,The boat had swept into the folds of it!
5358,PART THE NINTH,But all that vision of white darkness--lit
5359,PART THE NINTH,By the full splendour of the emerald stone
5360,PART THE NINTH,That from the forepart of the pinnace shone--
5361,PART THE NINTH,"Melted around her, as in sunder cleft"
5362,PART THE NINTH,By that strong spirit of light; and there was left
5363,PART THE NINTH,"A wandering space, behind her and before,"
5364,PART THE NINTH,"Of radiance, roofed and walled with mist, the floor"
5365,PART THE NINTH,A liquid pavement large. And so she passed
5366,PART THE NINTH,"Through twilight immemorial, and at last"
5367,PART THE NINTH,"Issued upon the other side, where lay"
5368,PART THE NINTH,The land no mortal knew before that day.
5369,PART THE NINTH,
5370,PART THE NINTH,"There wilding orchards faced the beach, and bare"
5371,PART THE NINTH,"All manner of delicious fruit and rare,"
5372,PART THE NINTH,Such as in gardens of kings' palaces
5373,PART THE NINTH,"Trembles upon the sultry-scented trees,"
5374,PART THE NINTH,The soul of many sunbeams at its core.
5375,PART THE NINTH,"Well-pleased the wanderer landed on this shore,"
5376,PART THE NINTH,"Beholding all its pleasantness, how sweet"
5377,PART THE NINTH,"And soft, to the tired soul, to the tired feet."
5378,PART THE NINTH,"And so he sat him down beneath the boughs,"
5379,PART THE NINTH,And there a low wind seemed to drone and drowse
5380,PART THE NINTH,Among the leaves as it were gone astray
5381,PART THE NINTH,And like to faint forwearied by the way;
5382,PART THE NINTH,Till the persistence of the sound begat
5383,PART THE NINTH,An heaviness within him as he sat:
5384,PART THE NINTH,"So when Sleep chanced to come that way, he found"
5385,PART THE NINTH,"A captive not unwilling to be bound,"
5386,PART THE NINTH,And on his body those fine fetters put
5387,PART THE NINTH,Wherewith he bindeth mortals hand and foot.
5388,PART THE NINTH,
5389,PART THE NINTH,"When the tired sleeper oped again his eyes,"
5390,PART THE NINTH,"'Twas early morn, and he beheld the skies"
5391,PART THE NINTH,Glowing from those deep hours of rest and dew
5392,PART THE NINTH,Wherein all creatures do themselves renew.
5393,PART THE NINTH,"The laughing leaves blink'd in the sun, throughout"
5394,PART THE NINTH,Those dewy realms of orchard thereabout;
5395,PART THE NINTH,"But green fields lay beyond, and farther still,"
5396,PART THE NINTH,"Betwixt them and the sun, a great high hill"
5397,PART THE NINTH,"Kept these in shadow, and the brighter made"
5398,PART THE NINTH,The fruitlands look for all that neighbouring shade.
5399,PART THE NINTH,"And he the solitary man uprose,"
5400,PART THE NINTH,His face toward the mountain beyond those
5401,PART THE NINTH,Fair fields not yet acquainted with the sun;
5402,PART THE NINTH,"And crossed the fields, and climbed the hill, and won"
5403,PART THE NINTH,The top; and journeying down the eastern side
5404,PART THE NINTH,"Entered upon a grassy vale and wide,"
5405,PART THE NINTH,"Where in the midst a pure stream ran, as yet"
5406,PART THE NINTH,"A youngling, hardly able to forget"
5407,PART THE NINTH,"The lofty place of its nativity,"
5408,PART THE NINTH,Nor lusting yet for union with the sea.
5409,PART THE NINTH,"And through this valley, taking for his guide"
5410,PART THE NINTH,"The stream, and walking by the waterside,"
5411,PART THE NINTH,"He wandered on, but had at whiles to ford"
5412,PART THE NINTH,The lesser brooks that from the mountains poured
5413,PART THE NINTH,"Into this greater; which by slow degrees,"
5414,PART THE NINTH,"Enlarged with such continual soft increase,"
5415,PART THE NINTH,"Became a river broad and fair, but still"
5416,PART THE NINTH,As clear as when it flowed a mountain-rill:
5417,PART THE NINTH,And he the wanderer wandering by that stream
5418,PART THE NINTH,Saw 'twas the river he had known in dream.
5419,PART THE NINTH,
5420,PART THE NINTH,So day by day he journeyed; and it chanced
5421,PART THE NINTH,One day he fared till night was well advanced
5422,PART THE NINTH,Ere lying down to sleep; and when he waked
5423,PART THE NINTH,"Next morn, his bones and all his body ached,"
5424,PART THE NINTH,"And on his temples lay a weary heat,"
5425,PART THE NINTH,And with sore pain he got upon his feet.
5426,PART THE NINTH,Yet when he rose and hard at hand espied
5427,PART THE NINTH,"The City sloping to the riverside,"
5428,PART THE NINTH,"With bright white walls and golden port agleam,"
5429,PART THE NINTH,Such as he saw them figured in the dream--
5430,PART THE NINTH,Then the blood leapt as fire along his veins
5431,PART THE NINTH,And the o'erwearied limbs forgat their pains.
5432,PART THE NINTH,But when he strove to make what speed he might
5433,PART THE NINTH,"Toward the happy haven full in sight,"
5434,PART THE NINTH,The feet that would have hastened thereunto
5435,PART THE NINTH,"Could not; and heavily, as old men do,"
5436,PART THE NINTH,"He fell to earth, and groaned aloud and said,"
5437,PART THE NINTH,"""Old man, what would'st thou, with thy silvered head,"
5438,PART THE NINTH,"Yonder, where all their tresses be as gold"
5439,PART THE NINTH,Forever?--Thou art suffered to behold
5440,PART THE NINTH,The city of thy search: what wilt thou more?
5441,PART THE NINTH,Tarry thou here upon this river-shore;
5442,PART THE NINTH,Thou mightest farther go nor find the grass
5443,PART THE NINTH,"Greener, whereon to lay thy head, and pass"
5444,PART THE NINTH,"Into the deep dark populous empty land."""
5445,PART THE NINTH,
5446,PART THE NINTH,"So spake the man, not able to withstand"
5447,PART THE NINTH,"This dumb remonstrance of the flesh, now first"
5448,PART THE NINTH,Thwarting the soul. Howbeit a mighty thirst
5449,PART THE NINTH,"Consumed him, and he crawled unto the brink"
5450,PART THE NINTH,"Of the clear stream hard by, that he might drink"
5451,PART THE NINTH,"One draught thereof, and with the water still"
5452,PART THE NINTH,His deep desire. When lo a miracle!
5453,PART THE NINTH,No sooner had he drunken than his whole
5454,PART THE NINTH,Body was changed and did from crown to sole
5455,PART THE NINTH,"The likeness of its youthful self put on,"
5456,PART THE NINTH,"The Prince of half-an-hundred years agone,"
5457,PART THE NINTH,Wearing the very garments that he wore
5458,PART THE NINTH,What time his years were but a single score.
5459,PART THE NINTH,
5460,PART THE NINTH,Then he remembered how that in The Dream
5461,PART THE NINTH,"One told him of the marvel of that stream,"
5462,PART THE NINTH,Whose waters are a well of youth eterne.
5463,PART THE NINTH,And night and day its crystal heart doth yearn
5464,PART THE NINTH,To wed its youthhood with the sea's old age;
5465,PART THE NINTH,"And faring on that bridal pilgrimage,"
5466,PART THE NINTH,"Its waters past the shining city are rolled,"
5467,PART THE NINTH,And all the people drink and wax not old.

5472,PART THE TENTH,That night within the City of Youth there stood
5473,PART THE TENTH,Musicians playing to the multitude
5474,PART THE TENTH,On many a gold and silver instrument
5475,PART THE TENTH,Whose differing souls yet chimed in glad consent.
5476,PART THE TENTH,"And sooth-tongued singers, throated like the bird"
5477,PART THE TENTH,"All darkness holds its breath to hear, were heard"
5478,PART THE TENTH,"Chanting aloud before the comely folk,"
5479,PART THE TENTH,"Chanting aloud till none-for listening spoke,"
5480,PART THE TENTH,Chanting aloud that all the city rang;

5489,I,"Rose the maid-moon with queenlier countenance,"
5490,I,"Came the stars forth a merrier madder crew,"
5491,I,"Than ever sun or maiden-moon before,"
5492,I,Or jostling stars that shook the darkness' floor
5493,I,With night-wide tremor 'neath their dizzy dance?
5494,I,
5495,I,"Strong is the Sun, but strong alway was he;"
5496,I,"The Moon is fair, but ever fair showed she;"
5497,I,"The Stars are many, and who hath known them few?"
5498,I,"As now they be, so heretofore were they:"
5499,I,"What is the wondrous thing hath chanced to-day,"
5500,I,"O happy hearts, the wondrous thing and new,"
5501,I,Whereof ye are glad together even more
5502,I,Than of the sunlight or the moonlight or
5503,I,The light o' the stars that strow the milky-way?
5504,I,
5505,I,For all your many maidens have the head
5506,I,"In goodly festal wise engarlanded,"
5507,I,"With flowers at noon the banquet of the bees,"
5508,I,And leaves that in some grove at midday grew:
5509,I,And ever since the falling of the dew
5510,I,"Your streets are full of pomps and pageantries,"
5511,I,"Laughter and song, feasting and dancing:--nay,"

5520,II,"Who turn the tides of life which way they please,"
5521,II,"And sit themselves aloft, aloof, at ease:"
5522,II,Dwellers in courts of marble silence they.
5523,II,No need to ask what thing the Fates have done
5524,II,"Between the sunrise and the set of sun,"
5525,II,Mute-moving in their twilight fastnesses!
5526,II,
5527,II,"Changeless, aloft, aloof, mute-moving, dim,"

5536,II,
5537,II,"Long time he tarried, but the time is past,"
5538,II,"And he hath come ye waited for, at last:"
5539,II,"The long-foretold, the much-desired, hath come."
5540,II,And ye command your minstrels noise abroad
5541,II,"With lyre and tongue your joyance and his laud,"

5551,III,Unmated she in all the land alone?
5552,III,"'Twas yours, O youths and maids, to clasp and kiss;"
5553,III,Desiring and desired ye had your bliss:
5554,III,The Queen she sat upon her loveless throne.
5555,III,"Sleeping she saw his face, but could not find"
5556,III,"Its phantom's phantom when she waked, nor wind"
5557,III,About her finger one gold hair of his.
5558,III,
5559,III,"Often when evening sobered all the air,"
5560,III,No doubt but she would sit and marvel where
5561,III,"He tarried, by the bounds of what strange sea;"
5562,III,And peradventure look at intervals
5563,III,"Forth of the windows of her palace walls,"
5564,III,And watch the gloaming darken fount and tree;
5565,III,"And think on twilight shores, with dreaming caves"
5566,III,"Full of the groping of bewildered waves,"
5567,III,Full of the murmur of their hollow halls.
5568,III,
5569,III,"As flowers desire the kisses of the rain,"
5570,III,"She his, and many a year desired in vain:"

5572,III,Nor listeth he to wander any more
5573,III,"Who went as go the winds from sea to shore,"
5574,III,From shore to sea who went as the winds go.
5575,III,The winds do seek a place of rest; the flowers

5582,ANGELO.,
5583,ANGELO.,"Seven moons, new moons, had eastward set their horns"
5584,ANGELO.,"Averted from the sun; seven moons, old moons,"
5585,ANGELO.,Westward their sun-averted horns had set;
5586,ANGELO.,"Since Angelo had brought his young bride home,"
5587,ANGELO.,"Lucia, to queen it in his Tuscan halls."
5588,ANGELO.,And much the folk had marvelled on that day
5589,ANGELO.,"Seeing the bride how young and fair she was,"
5590,ANGELO.,How all unlike the groom; for she had known
5591,ANGELO.,"Twenty and five soft summers woo the world,"
5592,ANGELO.,He twice as many winters take 't by storm.
5593,ANGELO.,"And in those half-an-hundred winters,--ay,"
5594,ANGELO.,"And in the summer's blaze, and blush of spring,"
5595,ANGELO.,"And pomp of grave and grandiose autumntides,--"
5596,ANGELO.,"Full many a wind had beat upon his heart,"
5597,ANGELO.,"Of grief and frustrate hope full many a wind,"
5598,ANGELO.,"And rains full many, but no rains could damp"
5599,ANGELO.,The fuel that was stored within; which lay
5600,ANGELO.,"Unlighted, waiting for the tinder-touch,"
5601,ANGELO.,Until a chance spark fall'n from Lucia's eyes
5602,ANGELO.,"Kindled the fuel, and the fire was love:"
5603,ANGELO.,"Not such as rises blown upon the wind,"
5604,ANGELO.,"Goaded to flame by gusts of phantasy,"
5605,ANGELO.,"But still, and needing no replenishment,"
5606,ANGELO.,"Unquenchable, that would not be put out."
5607,ANGELO.,
5608,ANGELO.,Albeit the lady Lucia's bosom lacked
5609,ANGELO.,The ore had made her heart a richer mine
5610,ANGELO.,Than earth's auriferous heart unsunned; from her
5611,ANGELO.,"Love went not out, in whom there was no love."
5612,ANGELO.,"Cold from the first, her breast grew frore, and bit"
5613,ANGELO.,Her kind lord's bosom with its stinging frost.
5614,ANGELO.,"Because he loved the fields and forests, made"
5615,ANGELO.,"Few banquetings for highborn winebibbers,"
5616,ANGELO.,"Eschewed the city and led no sumptuous life,"
5617,ANGELO.,"She, courtly, sneered at his uncourtliness,"
5618,ANGELO.,Deeming his manners of a bygone mode.
5619,ANGELO.,"And for that he was gentle overmuch,"
5620,ANGELO.,"And overmuch forbearant, she despised,"
5621,ANGELO.,"Mocked, slighted, taunted him, and of her scorn"
5622,ANGELO.,Made a sharp shaft to wound his life at will.
5623,ANGELO.,"She filled her cup with hate and bade him drink,"
5624,ANGELO.,And he returned it brimming o'er with love.
5625,ANGELO.,
5626,ANGELO.,And so seven moons had waxed and waned since these
5627,ANGELO.,"Were wedded. And it chanced, one morn of Spring"
5628,ANGELO.,Lucia bespake her spouse in even more
5629,ANGELO.,"Ungentle wise than was her wont, and he,"
5630,ANGELO.,"For the first time, reproved her;--not as one"
5631,ANGELO.,That having from another ta'en ill words
5632,ANGELO.,Will e'en cry quits and barter words as ill;
5633,ANGELO.,"But liker as a father, whom his child"
5634,ANGELO.,"With insolent lips hath wounded, chides the child"
5635,ANGELO.,"Less than he knows it had been wise to do,"
5636,ANGELO.,"Saying within himself: ""The time will come"
5637,ANGELO.,"When thou wilt think on thy dead father, how"
5638,ANGELO.,Thou might'st have spoken gentlier unto him
5639,ANGELO.,"One day, when yet thy father was alive:"
5640,ANGELO.,"So shall thy heart rebuke thy heart enow:""--"
5641,ANGELO.,Ev'n thus did Angelo reprove his wife.
5642,ANGELO.,
5643,ANGELO.,But though the words from his rough-bearded lips
5644,ANGELO.,Were like sweet water from the mouth of some
5645,ANGELO.,"Rock-fountain hewn with elemental hands,"
5646,ANGELO.,"They fell as water cast i' the fire, to be"
5647,ANGELO.,"Consumed with hissing rage. Her wrath, let loose,"
5648,ANGELO.,"Blew to and fro, and hither and thither, like"
5649,ANGELO.,A wind that seems to have forgotten whence
5650,ANGELO.,"It came, and whither it was bidden blow."
5651,ANGELO.,She cursed the kinsfolk who had willed that she
5652,ANGELO.,Should wed with him; and cursed herself that gave
5653,ANGELO.,Ear to the utterance of their will; and cursed
5654,ANGELO.,The day on which their will became her deed:
5655,ANGELO.,Saying--and this he knew not until now--
5656,ANGELO.,"""Fool, I should ne'er have wedded thee at all,"
5657,ANGELO.,"No, neither thee nor any like to thee,"
5658,ANGELO.,"Had not my father wellnigh forced me to 't."""
5659,ANGELO.,"And he that hearkened, the Lord Angelo,"
5660,ANGELO.,"Spake not a word, but bowed his head, and went"
5661,ANGELO.,"Forth of his castle to the forest nigh,"
5662,ANGELO.,"And roamed all day about the forest, filled"
5663,ANGELO.,"With grief, and marvelling at her lack of love."
5664,ANGELO.,
5665,ANGELO.,But that which sorelier bruised his breast than ev'n
5666,ANGELO.,"Lucia's exceeding lack of love for him,"
5667,ANGELO.,"Was this new knowledge, that in taking her"
5668,ANGELO.,To wife--in the very act of taking her
5669,ANGELO.,To wife--himself had crossed the secret will
5670,ANGELO.,Of her whose will in all things it had been
5671,ANGELO.,His soul's most perfect bliss to gratify.
5672,ANGELO.,"Wherefore, to make atonement, in some sort,"
5673,ANGELO.,For this one wrong he deemed that he had done
5674,ANGELO.,The woman--this one crossing of her will--
5675,ANGELO.,He knelt him down under the brooding shade
5676,ANGELO.,"Of a huge oak, and vowed 'fore heaven a vow:"
5677,ANGELO.,"To wit, that Lucia never afterward"
5678,ANGELO.,Should in his hearing utter forth a wish
5679,ANGELO.,For aught of earthly but himself would see
5680,ANGELO.,"That wish fulfilled, if such fulfilment were"
5681,ANGELO.,An end that mortal man could compass. Then
5682,ANGELO.,"Uprising, he beheld the sinking sun"
5683,ANGELO.,A vast round eye gaze in upon the wood
5684,ANGELO.,Through leafy lattice of its nether boughs:
5685,ANGELO.,"Whereat he turned him castlewards, and owned"
5686,ANGELO.,A lighter heart than he had borne that day.
5687,ANGELO.,
5688,ANGELO.,Homeward his face no sooner had he set
5689,ANGELO.,Than through the woods came riding unto him
5690,ANGELO.,"A stranger, of a goodly personage,"
5691,ANGELO.,"Young, and right richly habited, who stayed"
5692,ANGELO.,"His horse, and greeted Angelo, and said:"
5693,ANGELO.,"""I pray you, sir, direct me how to find"
5694,ANGELO.,"An hostel, if there be such hereabouts;"
5695,ANGELO.,"For I have ridden far, and lost my way"
5696,ANGELO.,"Among these woods, and twilight is at hand."""
5697,ANGELO.,"Then he that heard replied to him that asked,"
5698,ANGELO.,"Saying: ""The nearest inn is farther hence"
5699,ANGELO.,Than mine own house; make therefore mine own house
5700,ANGELO.,"Your inn for this one night, and unto such"
5701,ANGELO.,Poor entertainment as my house affords
5702,ANGELO.,"You are most welcome."" So the stranger thanked"
5703,ANGELO.,"In courtly speeches the Lord Angelo,"
5704,ANGELO.,Gladly accepting hospitalities
5705,ANGELO.,That were so gladly proffered; and the two
5706,ANGELO.,"Fared on together, host and guest that were"
5707,ANGELO.,"To be, until they reached the castle, where"
5708,ANGELO.,"Angelo dwelt, and where his fathers lived"
5709,ANGELO.,"Before him, lords of land, in olden days."
5710,ANGELO.,
5711,ANGELO.,"And entering in, the castle's later lord"
5712,ANGELO.,Led the young signor to the chamber where
5713,ANGELO.,"The lady Lucia sat, who rose to give"
5714,ANGELO.,"The stranger courteous welcome. (When she chose,"
5715,ANGELO.,Of looks and lips more gracious none than she.)
5716,ANGELO.,"But soon as she beheld the young man's face,"
5717,ANGELO.,"A sudden pallor seized her own, and back"
5718,ANGELO.,"She started, wellnigh swooning, but regained"
5719,ANGELO.,"Her wonted self as suddenly, declared"
5720,ANGELO.,'Twas but a momentary sickness went
5721,ANGELO.,"Arrow-like through her, sharp, but therewithal"
5722,ANGELO.,"Brief as the breath's one ebb and flow; and which,"
5723,ANGELO.,"Passing, had left her painless as before."
5724,ANGELO.,"And truly, from that moment she appeared"
5725,ANGELO.,"More brightly beautiful, if Angelo"
5726,ANGELO.,"Erred not, than she had looked for many a day."
5727,ANGELO.,
5728,ANGELO.,"So in brief while the stranger-guest sat down,"
5729,ANGELO.,"With host and hostess, to a table charged"
5730,ANGELO.,"With delicate meats, and fragrant fruits, and wine."
5731,ANGELO.,"And when the meal was over, and themselves"
5732,ANGELO.,Were with themselves alone--the serving-men
5733,ANGELO.,Having withdrawn--a cheerful converse rose
5734,ANGELO.,Concerning divers matters old and new.
5735,ANGELO.,And Angelo that evening let his tongue
5736,ANGELO.,Range more at freedom than he used; for though
5737,ANGELO.,"No man was less to prating given than he,"
5738,ANGELO.,"Yet, when he liked his listener, he could make"
5739,ANGELO.,His mouth discourse in such a wise that few
5740,ANGELO.,Had failed to give delighted audience.
5741,ANGELO.,"For he had learning, and, besides the lore"
5742,ANGELO.,"Won from his books, a better wisdom owned--"
5743,ANGELO.,"A knowledge of the stuff whence books are made,"
5744,ANGELO.,The human mind and all it feeds upon.
5745,ANGELO.,"And, in his youth a wanderer, he had roamed"
5746,ANGELO.,"O'er many countries, not as one who sees"
5747,ANGELO.,"With eyes alone, and hearkens but with ears;"
5748,ANGELO.,Rather as who would slake the thirst of the soul
5749,ANGELO.,By sucking wisdom from the breasts of the world.
5750,ANGELO.,
5751,ANGELO.,"Wherefore the hours flew lightly, winged with words;"
5752,ANGELO.,"Till Angelo, from telling of his own"
5753,ANGELO.,"Young days and early fortunes good and ill,"
5754,ANGELO.,"Was with remembrance smitten, as it chanced,"
5755,ANGELO.,Of some old grief 'twas grief to think upon.
5756,ANGELO.,"And so he changed his theme o' the sudden, donned"
5757,ANGELO.,"A shadowy mask of laboured pleasantry,"
5758,ANGELO.,"And said: ""My wife, sir, hath a pretty gift"
5759,ANGELO.,Of singing and of luting: it may be
5760,ANGELO.,If you should let your tongue turn mendicant--
5761,ANGELO.,"Not for itself but for its needy kin,"
5762,ANGELO.,Your ears--she might be got to give an alms
5763,ANGELO.,"For those twin brethren."" Whereupon the guest"
5764,ANGELO.,Unto his hostess turned and smiling said:
5765,ANGELO.,"""That were indeed a golden alms your voice"
5766,ANGELO.,"Could well afford, and never know itself"
5767,ANGELO.,"The poorer, being a mint of suchlike coin."""
5768,ANGELO.,"And she made answer archly: ""I have oft"
5769,ANGELO.,Heard flatterers of a woman's singing say
5770,ANGELO.,Her voice was silvery:--to compare 't with gold
5771,ANGELO.,"Is sure a new conceit. But, sir, you praise"
5772,ANGELO.,"My singing, who have not yet heard me sing."""
5773,ANGELO.,"And he: ""I take it that a woman's speech"
5774,ANGELO.,Is to her singing what a bird's low chirp
5775,ANGELO.,Is to _its_ singing: and if Philomel
5776,ANGELO.,"Chirp in the hearing of the woodman, he"
5777,ANGELO.,"Knows 'tis the nightingale that chirps, and so"
5778,ANGELO.,Expects nought meaner than its sovereign song.
5779,ANGELO.,"Madam, 'tis thus your speaking-voice hath given"
5780,ANGELO.,Earnest of what your singing-voice will be;
5781,ANGELO.,And therefore I entreat you not to dash
5782,ANGELO.,"The expectations you have raised so high,"
5783,ANGELO.,"By your refusal."" And she answered him:"
5784,ANGELO.,"""Nay, if you think to hear a nightingale,"
5785,ANGELO.,I doubt refusal could not dash them more
5786,ANGELO.,"Than will compliance. But in very truth,"
5787,ANGELO.,"The boon you crave so small and worthless is,"
5788,ANGELO.,"'Twere miserly to grudge it. Where's my lute?"""
5789,ANGELO.,
5790,ANGELO.,"So saying, she bethought her suddenly--"
5791,ANGELO.,Or feigned to have bethought her suddenly--
5792,ANGELO.,How she had left the lute that afternoon
5793,ANGELO.,"Lying upon an arbour-seat, when she"
5794,ANGELO.,Grew tired of fingering the strings of it--
5795,ANGELO.,"Down in the garden, where she wont to walk,"
5796,ANGELO.,Her lute loquacious to the trees' deaf trunks.
5797,ANGELO.,"And Angelo, right glad to render her"
5798,ANGELO.,"Such little graceful offices of love,"
5799,ANGELO.,And gladder yet with hope to hear her sing
5800,ANGELO.,"Who had denied his asking many a time,"
5801,ANGELO.,"Awaited not another word, but rose"
5802,ANGELO.,"And said, ""Myself will bring it,"" and before"
5803,ANGELO.,"She could assent or disapprove, was gone."
5804,ANGELO.,
5805,ANGELO.,Scarce had he left the chamber when behold
5806,ANGELO.,"His wife uprose, and his young stranger-guest"
5807,ANGELO.,"Uprose, and in a trice they cast their arms"
5808,ANGELO.,"About each other, kissed each other, called"
5809,ANGELO.,"Each other _dear_ and _love_, till Lucia said:"
5810,ANGELO.,"""Why cam'st thou not before, my Ugo, whom"
5811,ANGELO.,"I loved, who lovedst me, for many a day,"
5812,ANGELO.,"For many a paradisal day, ere yet"
5813,ANGELO.,I saw that lean fool with the grizzled beard
5814,ANGELO.,"Who's gone a-questing for his true wife's lute?"""
5815,ANGELO.,"And he made answer: ""I had come erenow,"
5816,ANGELO.,"But that my father, dying, left a load"
5817,ANGELO.,Of cumbrous duties I had needs perform--
5818,ANGELO.,"Dry, peevish, crabbèd business at the best,"
5819,ANGELO.,"Impertinences indispensable,"
5820,ANGELO.,"Accumulated dulness, if you will,"
5821,ANGELO.,Such as I would not irk your ears withal:
5822,ANGELO.,"Howbeit I came at last, and nigh a week"
5823,ANGELO.,"Have tarried in the region hereabouts,"
5824,ANGELO.,"Unknown--and yearning for one glimpse of you,"
5825,ANGELO.,"One word, one kiss from you, if even it were"
5826,ANGELO.,"One only and the last; until, to-day,"
5827,ANGELO.,"Roaming the neighbouring forest, I espied"
5828,ANGELO.,"Your husband, guessed it was your husband, feigned"
5829,ANGELO.,I was a traveller who had lost myself
5830,ANGELO.,"Among the woods, received from him--ah, now"
5831,ANGELO.,"You laugh, and truly 'tis a famous jest--"
5832,ANGELO.,"A courteous invitation to his house,"
5833,ANGELO.,"Deemed it were churlish to refuse, and so--"
5834,ANGELO.,"And so am here, your Ugo, with a heart"
5835,ANGELO.,"The loyal subject of your sovereign heart,"
5836,ANGELO.,"As in old days."" Therewith he sat him down,"
5837,ANGELO.,And softly drawing her upon his knee
5838,ANGELO.,Made him a zone of her lascivious arms.
5839,ANGELO.,
5840,ANGELO.,But thus encinctured hardly had he sat
5841,ANGELO.,"A moment, when, returning, Angelo"
5842,ANGELO.,"Stood at the threshold of the room, and held"
5843,ANGELO.,"The door half opened, and so standing saw"
5844,ANGELO.,"The lovers, and they saw not him; for half"
5845,ANGELO.,"The chamber lay in shadow, by no lamp"
5846,ANGELO.,"Lighted, or window to admit the moon:"
5847,ANGELO.,"And there the entrance was, and Angelo."
5848,ANGELO.,
5849,ANGELO.,"And listening to their speech a little space,"
5850,ANGELO.,The fugitive brief moments were to him
5851,ANGELO.,A pyramid of piled eternities.
5852,ANGELO.,"For while he hearkened, Ugo said: ""My love,"
5853,ANGELO.,"Answer me this one question, which may seem"
5854,ANGELO.,"Idle, yet is not;--how much lov'st thou me?"""
5855,ANGELO.,"And she replied: ""I love thee just as much"
5856,ANGELO.,"As I do hate my husband, and no more."""
5857,ANGELO.,"Then he: ""But prithee how much hatest thou"
5858,ANGELO.,"Thy husband?"" And she answered: ""Ev'n as much"
5859,ANGELO.,As I love thee. To hate him one whit more
5860,ANGELO.,"Than that, were past the power of Lucia's hate."""
5861,ANGELO.,"And Ugo: ""If thou lovest me so much,"
5862,ANGELO.,"Grant me one gift in token of thy love."""
5863,ANGELO.,"Then she: ""What would'st thou?"" And he answered her:"
5864,ANGELO.,"""Even thyself; no poorer gift will I."""
5865,ANGELO.,"But Lucia said: ""Nay, have I not bestowed"
5866,ANGELO.,"My love, which is my soul, my richer self?"
5867,ANGELO.,"My poorer self, which is my body, how"
5868,ANGELO.,"Can I bestow, when 'tis not in mine own"
5869,ANGELO.,"Possession, being his property forsooth,"
5870,ANGELO.,Who holds the ecclesiastic title-deed?...
5871,ANGELO.,"Yet--but I know not ... if I grant this boon,"
5872,ANGELO.,"Bethink thee, how wilt carry hence the gift?"
5873,ANGELO.,"Quick. For the time is all-too brief to waste."""
5874,ANGELO.,"And Ugo spake with hurrying tongue: ""Right so:"
5875,ANGELO.,"To-morrow, therefore, when the sun hath set,"
5876,ANGELO.,"Quit thou the castle, all alone, and haste"
5877,ANGELO.,To yonder tarn that lies amid the trees
5878,ANGELO.,Haply a furlong westward from your house--
5879,ANGELO.,The gloomy lakelet fringed with pines--and there
5880,ANGELO.,Upon the hither margin thou shalt find
5881,ANGELO.,"Me, and two with me, mounted all, and armed,"
5882,ANGELO.,With a fourth steed to bear thee on his back:
5883,ANGELO.,"And thou shalt fly with me, my Lucia, till"
5884,ANGELO.,"Thou reach my castle in the mountain'd North,"
5885,ANGELO.,"Whose mistress I will make thee, and mine own."""
5886,ANGELO.,"Then Lucia said: ""But how if Angelo"
5887,ANGELO.,"Pursue and overtake us?"" Whereupon"
5888,ANGELO.,"Ugo replied: ""Pursue he may,--o'ertake"
5889,ANGELO.,"He shall not, save he saddle him the wind."
5890,ANGELO.,Besides--to grant the impossible--if he
5891,ANGELO.,"_Were_ to o'ertake us, he could only strive"
5892,ANGELO.,To win you back with argument; wherein
5893,ANGELO.,"My servants, at their master's bidding, could"
5894,ANGELO.,Debate with him on more than equal terms:
5895,ANGELO.,Cold steel convinces warmest disputants.
5896,ANGELO.,"Or, if to see the bosom marital"
5897,ANGELO.,"Impierced, would make your own consorted heart"
5898,ANGELO.,"Bleed sympathetic, some more mild--"" But she,"
5899,ANGELO.,"The beauteous Fury, interrupted him"
5900,ANGELO.,"With passionate-pallid lips: ""Reproach me not"
5901,ANGELO.,Beforehand--even in jest reproach me not--
5902,ANGELO.,With imputation of such tenderness
5903,ANGELO.,For _him_ and _his_ life--when thou knowest how
5904,ANGELO.,"I hate, hate, hate him,--when thou knowest how"
5905,ANGELO.,"I wish, and wish, and wish, that he were dead."""
5906,ANGELO.,
5907,ANGELO.,Then Angelo bethought him of his vow;
5908,ANGELO.,And stepping forward stood before the twain;
5909,ANGELO.,And from his girdle plucked a dagger forth;
5910,ANGELO.,"And spake no word, but pierced his own heart through."

6170,II,And those are dead and these are more than dead;
6171,II,And those have known
6172,II,"The springtime, these the lovetime, overthrown,"
6173,II,"With all fair times and pleasureful that be."""
6174,II,"And shall not we, O Time, and shall not we"
6175,II,Thy strong self see
6176,II,"Brought low and vanquishèd,"
6177,II,And made to bow the knee
6178,II,And bow the head
6179,II,"To one that is when thou and thine are fled,"
6180,II,The silent-eyed austere Eternity?
6181,II,

6183,III,
6184,III,Behold a new song still the lark doth sing
6185,III,"Each morning when he riseth from the grass,"
6186,III,"And no man sigheth for the song that was,"
6187,III,The melody that yestermorn did bring.
6188,III,"The rose dies and the lily, and no man mourns"
6189,III,That nevermore the selfsame flower returns:
6190,III,"For well we know a thousand flowers will spring,"
6191,III,A thousand birds make music on the wing.
6192,III,"Ay me! fair things and sweet are birds and flowers,"
6193,III,"The scent of lily and rose in gardens still,"
6194,III,The babble of beakèd mouths that speak no ill:
6195,III,"And love is sweeter yet than flower or bird,"
6196,III,Or any odor smelled or ditty heard--
6197,III,Love is another and a sweeter thing.
6198,III,"But when the music ceaseth in Love's bowers,"
6199,III,Who listeneth well shall hear the silence stirred
6200,III,With aftermoan of many a fretful string:
6201,III,"For when Love harpeth to the hollow hours,"
6202,III,His gladdest notes make saddest echoing.

6208,VANISHINGS,As one whose eyes have watched the stricken day
6209,VANISHINGS,"Swoon to its crimson death adown the sea,"
6210,VANISHINGS,Turning his face to eastward suddenly
6211,VANISHINGS,"Sees a lack-lustre world all chill and gray,--"
6212,VANISHINGS,"Then, wandering sunless whitherso he may,"
6213,VANISHINGS,"Feels the first dubious dumb obscurity,"
6214,VANISHINGS,"And vague foregloomings of the Dark to be,"
6215,VANISHINGS,Close like a sadness round his glimmering way;
6216,VANISHINGS,"So I, from drifting dreambound on and on"
6217,VANISHINGS,"About strange isles of utter bliss, in seas"
6218,VANISHINGS,"Whose waves are unimagined melodies,"
6219,VANISHINGS,Rose and beheld the dreamless world anew:
6220,VANISHINGS,"Sad were the fields, and dim with splendours gone"
6221,VANISHINGS,The strait sky-glimpses fugitive and few.

6230,BEETHOVEN,"Disburden them, I know not; but methought,"
6231,BEETHOVEN,What time to day mine ear the utterance caught
6232,BEETHOVEN,Whereby in manifold melodious wise
6233,BEETHOVEN,Thy heart's unrestful infelicities
6234,BEETHOVEN,"Rose like a sea with easeless winds distraught,"
6235,BEETHOVEN,"That thine seemed angel's grieving, as of one"
6236,BEETHOVEN,"Strayed somewhere out of heaven, and uttering"
6237,BEETHOVEN,Lone moan and alien wail: because he hath
6238,BEETHOVEN,"Failed to remember the remounting path,"
6239,BEETHOVEN,"And singing, weeping, can but weep and sing"

6246,GOD-SEEKING,God-seeking thou hast journeyed far and nigh.
6247,GOD-SEEKING,On dawn-lit mountain-tops thy soul did yearn
6248,GOD-SEEKING,To hear His trailing garments wander by;
6249,GOD-SEEKING,"And where 'mid thunderous glooms great sunsets burn,"
6250,GOD-SEEKING,Vainly thou sought'st His shadow on sea and sky;
6251,GOD-SEEKING,"Or gazing up, at noontide, could'st discern"
6252,GOD-SEEKING,Only a neutral heaven's indifferent eye
6253,GOD-SEEKING,And countenance austerely taciturn.
6254,GOD-SEEKING,
6255,GOD-SEEKING,Yet whom thou soughtest I have found at last;
6256,GOD-SEEKING,Neither where tempest dims the world below
6257,GOD-SEEKING,Nor where the westering daylight reels aghast
6258,GOD-SEEKING,In conflagrations of red overthrow:
6259,GOD-SEEKING,"But where this virgin brooklet silvers past,"
6260,GOD-SEEKING,And yellowing either bank the king-cups blow.

6269,SKYFARING,"From shade to shade the wingèd steeds did leap,"

6276,SKYFARING,"""O whither through the vastness are we bound?"

6278,SKYFARING,Therewith I heard the ends of night resound;
