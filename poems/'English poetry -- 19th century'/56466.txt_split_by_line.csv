31,OXFORD,_THE Author of these poems is too well aware of their demerits to allow
32,OXFORD,them to be republished thus without some apology. But it happens that
33,OXFORD,"the Printer, at whose request this selection is made, is willing to"
34,OXFORD,take so fair a share of the blame as to make any further explanation
35,OXFORD,unnecessary._

113,ELEGY,
114,ELEGY,"Clear and gentle stream,"
115,ELEGY,"Known and loved so long,"
116,ELEGY,That hast heard the song
117,ELEGY,And the idle dream
118,ELEGY,Of my boyish day;
119,ELEGY,While I once again
120,ELEGY,"Down thy margin stray,"
121,ELEGY,In the selfsame strain
122,ELEGY,"Still my voice is spent,"
123,ELEGY,"With my old lament,"
124,ELEGY,"And my idle dream,"
125,ELEGY,Clear and gentle stream!
126,ELEGY,
127,ELEGY,Where my old seat was
128,ELEGY,"Here again I sit,"
129,ELEGY,Where the long boughs knit
130,ELEGY,Over stream and graís
131,ELEGY,Thick translucent eaves:
132,ELEGY,Where back eddies play
133,ELEGY,"Shipwreck with the leaves,"
134,ELEGY,"And the proud swans stray,"
135,ELEGY,Sailing one by one
136,ELEGY,"Out of stream and sun,"
137,ELEGY,And the fish lie cool
138,ELEGY,In their chosen pool.
139,ELEGY,
140,ELEGY,Many an afternoon
141,ELEGY,Of the summer day
142,ELEGY,Dreaming here I lay;
143,ELEGY,And I know how soon
144,ELEGY,Idly at its hour
145,ELEGY,First the deep bell hums
146,ELEGY,"From the minster tower,"
147,ELEGY,"And then evening comes,"
148,ELEGY,"Creeping up the glade,"
149,ELEGY,"With her lengthening shade,"
150,ELEGY,And the tardy boon
151,ELEGY,Of her brightening moon.
152,ELEGY,
153,ELEGY,"Clear and gentle stream,"
154,ELEGY,Ere again I go
155,ELEGY,"Where thou dost not flow,"
156,ELEGY,Well does it beseem
157,ELEGY,Thee to hear again
158,ELEGY,"Once my youthful song,"
159,ELEGY,That familiar strain
160,ELEGY,Silent now so long:
161,ELEGY,Be as I content
162,ELEGY,"With my old lament,"
163,ELEGY,"And my idle dream,"
164,ELEGY,Clear and gentle stream!
165,ELEGY,
166,ELEGY,[Illustration]
167,ELEGY,
168,ELEGY,
169,ELEGY,
170,ELEGY,
171,ELEGY,"Dear lady, when thou frownest,"
172,ELEGY,"And my true love despisest,"
173,ELEGY,And all thy vows disownest
174,ELEGY,That sealed my venture wisest;
175,ELEGY,I think thy pride’s displeasure
176,ELEGY,Neglects a matchless treasure
177,ELEGY,Exceeding price and measure.
178,ELEGY,
179,ELEGY,"But when again thou smilest,"
180,ELEGY,"And love for love returnest,"
181,ELEGY,"And fear with joy beguilest,"
182,ELEGY,And takest truth in earnest;
183,ELEGY,"Then, though I most adore thee,"
184,ELEGY,The sum of my love for thee
185,ELEGY,"Seems poor, scant and unworthy."
186,ELEGY,
187,ELEGY,
188,ELEGY,
189,ELEGY,
190,ELEGY,"Poor withered rose and dry,"
191,ELEGY,"Skeleton of a rose,"
192,ELEGY,Risen to testify
193,ELEGY,To love’s sad close:
194,ELEGY,
195,ELEGY,"Treasured for love’s sweet sake,"
196,ELEGY,That of joy past
197,ELEGY,Thou might’st again awake
198,ELEGY,Memory at last:
199,ELEGY,
200,ELEGY,"Yet is thy perfume sweet,"
201,ELEGY,Thy petals red
202,ELEGY,"Yet tell of summer heat,"
203,ELEGY,And the gay bed:
204,ELEGY,
205,ELEGY,Yet yet recall the glow
206,ELEGY,"Of the gazing sun,"
207,ELEGY,When at thy bush we two
208,ELEGY,Joined hands in one.
209,ELEGY,
210,ELEGY,"But, rose, thou hast not seen,"
211,ELEGY,Thou hast not wept
212,ELEGY,The change that passed between
213,ELEGY,Whilst thou hast slept.
214,ELEGY,
215,ELEGY,To me thou seemest yet
216,ELEGY,The dead dream’s thrall:
217,ELEGY,While I live and forget
218,ELEGY,"Dream, truth and all."
219,ELEGY,
220,ELEGY,"Thou art more fresh than I,"
221,ELEGY,"Rose, sweet and red:"
222,ELEGY,Salt on my pale cheeks lie
223,ELEGY,The tears I shed.
224,ELEGY,
225,ELEGY,[Illustration]
226,ELEGY,
227,ELEGY,
228,ELEGY,
229,ELEGY,
230,ELEGY,I found to-day out walking
231,ELEGY,The flower my love loves best.
232,ELEGY,"What, when I stooped to pluck it,"
233,ELEGY,Could dare my hand arrest?
234,ELEGY,
235,ELEGY,Was it a snake lay curling
236,ELEGY,About the root’s thick crown?
237,ELEGY,Or did some hidden bramble
238,ELEGY,Tear my hand reaching down?
239,ELEGY,
240,ELEGY,"There was no snake uncurling,"
241,ELEGY,And no thorn wounded me;
242,ELEGY,"’Twas my heart checked me, sighing"
243,ELEGY,She is beyond the sea.
244,ELEGY,
245,ELEGY,
246,ELEGY,
247,ELEGY,
248,ELEGY,"_Will Love again awake,"
249,ELEGY,That lies asleep so long?_
250,ELEGY,O hush! ye tongues that shake
251,ELEGY,The drowsy night with song.
252,ELEGY,
253,ELEGY,_It is a lady fair
254,ELEGY,"Whom once he deigned to praise,"
255,ELEGY,That at the door doth dare
256,ELEGY,Her sad complaint to raise._
257,ELEGY,
258,ELEGY,"She must be fair of face,"
259,ELEGY,"As bold in heart she seems,"
260,ELEGY,If she would match her grace
261,ELEGY,With the delight of dreams.
262,ELEGY,
263,ELEGY,_Her beauty would surprise
264,ELEGY,"Gazers on Autumn eves,"
265,ELEGY,Who watched the broad moon rise
266,ELEGY,Upon the scattered sheaves._
267,ELEGY,
268,ELEGY,O sweet must be the voice
269,ELEGY,"He shall descend to hear,"
270,ELEGY,Who doth in Heaven rejoice
271,ELEGY,His most enchanted ear.
272,ELEGY,
273,ELEGY,"_The smile, that rests to play"
274,ELEGY,"Upon her lip, foretells"
275,ELEGY,What musical array
276,ELEGY,Tricks her sweet syllables._
277,ELEGY,
278,ELEGY,And yet her smiles have danced
279,ELEGY,"In vain, if her discourse"
280,ELEGY,Win not the soul entranced
281,ELEGY,In divine intercourse.
282,ELEGY,
283,ELEGY,_She will encounter all
284,ELEGY,"This trial without shame,"
285,ELEGY,"Her eyes men Beauty call,"
286,ELEGY,And Wisdom is her name._
287,ELEGY,
288,ELEGY,"Throw back the portals then,"
289,ELEGY,"Ye guards, your watch that keep,"
290,ELEGY,Love will awake again
291,ELEGY,That lay so long asleep.

300,A PASSER BY,"Leaning across the bosom of the urgent West,"
301,A PASSER BY,"That fearest nor sea rising, nor sky clouding,"
302,A PASSER BY,"Whither away, fair rover, and what thy quest?"
303,A PASSER BY,"Ah! soon, when Winter has all our vales opprest,"
304,A PASSER BY,"When skies are cold and misty, and hail is hurling,"
305,A PASSER BY,"Wilt thou glide on the blue Pacific, or rest"
306,A PASSER BY,"In a summer haven asleep, thy white sails furling."
307,A PASSER BY,
308,A PASSER BY,"I there before thee, in the country so well thou knowest,"
309,A PASSER BY,Already arrived am inhaling the odorous air:
310,A PASSER BY,"I watch thee enter unerringly where thou goest,"
311,A PASSER BY,"And anchor queen of the strange shipping there,"
312,A PASSER BY,"Thy sails for awning spread, thy masts bare:"
313,A PASSER BY,"Nor is aught from the foaming reef to the snowcapped, grandest"
314,A PASSER BY,"Peak, that is over the feathery palms more fair"

319,A PASSER BY,"That thou hast a purpose joyful, a courage blameless,"
320,A PASSER BY,Thy port assured in a happier land than mine.
321,A PASSER BY,"But for all I have given thee, beauty enough is thine,"

332,LATE SPRING EVENING,
333,LATE SPRING EVENING,
334,LATE SPRING EVENING,"I saw the Virgin-mother clad in green,"
335,LATE SPRING EVENING,Walking the sprinkled meadows at sundown;
336,LATE SPRING EVENING,While yet the moon’s cold flame was hung between
337,LATE SPRING EVENING,"The day and night, above the dusky town:"
338,LATE SPRING EVENING,"I saw her brighter than the Western gold,"
339,LATE SPRING EVENING,Whereto she faced in splendour to behold.
340,LATE SPRING EVENING,
341,LATE SPRING EVENING,Her dress was greener than the tenderest leaf
342,LATE SPRING EVENING,That trembled in the sunset glare aglow:
343,LATE SPRING EVENING,"Herself more delicate than is the brief,"
344,LATE SPRING EVENING,"Pink apple-blossom, that May showers lay low,"
345,LATE SPRING EVENING,And more delicious than’s the earliest streak
346,LATE SPRING EVENING,The blushing rose shows of her crimson cheek.
347,LATE SPRING EVENING,
348,LATE SPRING EVENING,"With jealous grace her idle ears to please,"
349,LATE SPRING EVENING,"A music entered, making passion fain:"
350,LATE SPRING EVENING,"Three nightingales sat singing in the trees,"
351,LATE SPRING EVENING,And praised the Goddess for the fallen rain;
352,LATE SPRING EVENING,"Which yet their unseen motions did arouse,"
353,LATE SPRING EVENING,Or parting Zephyrs shook out from the boughs.
354,LATE SPRING EVENING,
355,LATE SPRING EVENING,"And o’er the treetops, scattered in mid air,"
356,LATE SPRING EVENING,"The exhausted clouds, laden with crimson light,"
357,LATE SPRING EVENING,"Floated, or seemed to sleep; and, highest there,"
358,LATE SPRING EVENING,One planet broke the lingering ranks of night;
359,LATE SPRING EVENING,"Daring day’s company, so he might spy"
360,LATE SPRING EVENING,The Virgin-queen once with his watchful eye.
361,LATE SPRING EVENING,
362,LATE SPRING EVENING,"And when I saw her, then I worshipped her,"
363,LATE SPRING EVENING,"And said,—O bounteous Spring, O beauteous Spring,"
364,LATE SPRING EVENING,"Mother of all my years, thou who dost stir"
365,LATE SPRING EVENING,"My heart to adore thee and my tongue to sing,"
366,LATE SPRING EVENING,"Flower of my fruit, of my heart’s blood the fire,"
367,LATE SPRING EVENING,Of all my satisfaction the desire!
368,LATE SPRING EVENING,
369,LATE SPRING EVENING,"How art thou every year more beautiful,"
370,LATE SPRING EVENING,Younger for all the winters thou hast cast:
371,LATE SPRING EVENING,"And I, for all my love grows, grow more dull,"
372,LATE SPRING EVENING,Decaying with each season overpast!
373,LATE SPRING EVENING,"In vain to teach him love must man employ thee,"
374,LATE SPRING EVENING,The more he learns the less he can enjoy thee.

380,WOOING,
381,WOOING,
382,WOOING,"I know not how I came,"
383,WOOING,"New on my knightly journey,"
384,WOOING,To win the fairest dame
385,WOOING,That graced my maiden tourney.
386,WOOING,
387,WOOING,Chivalry’s lovely prize
388,WOOING,"With all men’s gaze upon her,"
389,WOOING,Why did she free her eyes
390,WOOING,"On me, to do me honour?"
391,WOOING,
392,WOOING,Ah! ne’er had I my mind
393,WOOING,"With such high hope delighted,"
394,WOOING,"Had she not first inclined,"
395,WOOING,And with her eyes invited.
396,WOOING,
397,WOOING,"But never doubt I knew,"
398,WOOING,"Having their glance to cheer me,"
399,WOOING,Until the day joy grew
400,WOOING,"Too great, too sure, too near me."
401,WOOING,
402,WOOING,"When hope a fear became,"
403,WOOING,"And passion, grown too tender,"
404,WOOING,Now trembled at the shame
405,WOOING,Of a despised surrender;
406,WOOING,
407,WOOING,And where my love at first
408,WOOING,"Saw kindness in her smiling,"
409,WOOING,"I read her pride, and cursed"
410,WOOING,The arts of her beguiling.
411,WOOING,
412,WOOING,"Till winning less than won,"
413,WOOING,"And liker wooed than wooing,"
414,WOOING,Too late I turned undone
415,WOOING,Away from my undoing;
416,WOOING,
417,WOOING,"And stood beside the door,"
418,WOOING,"Whereto she followed, making"
419,WOOING,My hard leave-taking more
420,WOOING,Hard by her sweet leave-taking.
421,WOOING,
422,WOOING,Her speech would have betrayed
423,WOOING,"Her thought, had mine been colder:"
424,WOOING,Her eyes distress had made
425,WOOING,A lesser lover bolder.
426,WOOING,
427,WOOING,"But no! Fond heart distrust,"
428,WOOING,"Cried Wisdom, and consider:"
429,WOOING,"Go free, since go thou must,"
430,WOOING,And so farewell I bid her.
431,WOOING,
432,WOOING,And brisk upon my way
433,WOOING,"I smote the stroke to sever,"
434,WOOING,And should have lost that day
435,WOOING,My life’s delight for ever;
436,WOOING,
437,WOOING,But when I saw her start
438,WOOING,And turn aside and tremble;—
439,WOOING,"Ah! she was true, her heart"
440,WOOING,I knew did not dissemble.
441,WOOING,
442,WOOING,
443,WOOING,
444,WOOING,
445,WOOING,"There is a hill beside the silver Thames,"
446,WOOING,Shady with birch and beech and odorous pine:
447,WOOING,And brilliant underfoot with thousand gems
448,WOOING,Steeply the thickets to his floods decline.
449,WOOING,Straight trees in every place
450,WOOING,"Their thick tops interlace,"
451,WOOING,And pendant branches trail their foliage fine
452,WOOING,Upon his watery face.
453,WOOING,
454,WOOING,Swift from the sweltering pasturage he flows:
455,WOOING,"His stream, alert to seek the pleasant shade,"
456,WOOING,"Pictures his gentle purpose, as he goes"
457,WOOING,Straight to the caverned pool his toil has made.
458,WOOING,His winter floods lay bare
459,WOOING,The stout roots in the air:
460,WOOING,"His summer streams are cool, when they have played"
461,WOOING,Among their fibrous hair.
462,WOOING,
463,WOOING,"A rushy island guards the sacred bower,"
464,WOOING,"And hides it from the meadow, where in peace"
465,WOOING,"The lazy cows wrench many a scented flower,"
466,WOOING,Robbing the golden market of the bees:
467,WOOING,And laden barges float
468,WOOING,By banks of myosote;
469,WOOING,And scented flags and golden flower-de-lys
470,WOOING,Delay the loitering boat.
471,WOOING,
472,WOOING,"And on this side the island, where the pool"
473,WOOING,"Eddies away, are tangled mass on mass"
474,WOOING,"The water-weeds, that net the fishes cool"
475,WOOING,And scarce allow a narrow stream to pass;

479,WOOING,Below her silver stars.

485,WOOING,Yet should her roots but try
486,WOOING,"Within these deeps to lie,"
487,WOOING,Not her long reaching stalk could ever hold
488,WOOING,Her waxen head so high.
489,WOOING,
490,WOOING,"Sometimes an angler comes, and drops his hook"
491,WOOING,"Within its hidden depths, and ’gainst a tree"
492,WOOING,"Leaning his rod, reads in some pleasant book,"
493,WOOING,Forgetting soon his pride of fishery;
494,WOOING,"And dreams, or falls asleep,"
495,WOOING,While curious fishes peep
496,WOOING,"About his nibbled bait, or scornfully"
497,WOOING,Dart off and rise and leap.
498,WOOING,
499,WOOING,And sometimes by the pathway through the trees
500,WOOING,An aged dame at evening trudges home:
501,WOOING,"And merry voices greet her, and she sees"
502,WOOING,"Her dear grandchildren, down the hill that come"
503,WOOING,"To meet her, and to bear"
504,WOOING,"Her basket home with care,"
505,WOOING,"Divining that, of all her treasures, some"
506,WOOING,Will be for them to share.

508,WOOING,"Else, he that wishes solitude is safe,"
509,WOOING,Whether he bathe at morning in the stream:
510,WOOING,Or lead his love there when the hot hours chafe
511,WOOING,"The meadows, busy with a blurring steam;"
512,WOOING,"Or watch, as fades the light,"
513,WOOING,"The gibbous moon grow bright,"
514,WOOING,"Until her magic rays dance in a dream,"

516,WOOING,
517,WOOING,Where is this bower beside the silver Thames?
518,WOOING,"O pool and flowery thickets, hear my vow!"
519,WOOING,"O trees of freshest foliage and straight stems,"
520,WOOING,No sharer of my secret I allow:

963,REPLY,"To escape the trained eye that strains in seeing,"
964,REPLY,Dost thou fly with us whither we are fleeing;
965,REPLY,"Or home in our creations, to withstand"
966,REPLY,"Blackwingèd death, that slays the making hand?"
967,REPLY,
968,REPLY,"The making mind, that must untimely perish"
969,REPLY,"Amidst its work which time may not destroy,"
970,REPLY,"The beauteous forms which man shall love to cherish,"
971,REPLY,The glorious songs that combat earths annoy?
972,REPLY,"Thou dost dwell here, I know, divinest Joy:"
973,REPLY,"But they who build thy towers fair and strong,"
974,REPLY,"Of all that toil, feel most of care and wrong."
975,REPLY,
976,REPLY,"Sense is so tender, O and hope so high,"
977,REPLY,That common pleasures mock their hope and sense;
978,REPLY,And swifter than doth lightning from the sky
979,REPLY,"The ecstasy they pine for flashes hence,"
980,REPLY,"Leaving the darkness and the woe immense,"
981,REPLY,"Wherewith it seems no thread of light was woven,"
982,REPLY,Nor doth the track remain where once ’twas cloven.
983,REPLY,
984,REPLY,And heaven and all the stable elements
985,REPLY,"That guard God’s purpose mock us, though the mind"
986,REPLY,Be spent in searching: for his old intents
987,REPLY,We see were never for our joy designed:
988,REPLY,"They shine as doth the bright sun on the blind,"
989,REPLY,"Or like his pensioned stars, that hymn above"
990,REPLY,"His praise, but not toward us, that God is Love."
991,REPLY,
992,REPLY,For who so well hath wooed the maiden hours
993,REPLY,"As quite to have won the worth of their rich show,"
994,REPLY,"To rob the night of mystery, or the flowers"
995,REPLY,Of their sweet delicacy ere they go?
996,REPLY,"Nay, even the dear occasion when we know"
997,REPLY,"We miss the joy, and on the gliding day"
998,REPLY,"The special glories float and pass away,"
999,REPLY,
1000,REPLY,Only life’s common plod: still to repair
1001,REPLY,The body and the thing which perisheth:
1002,REPLY,"The soil, the smutch, the toil and ache and wear,"
1003,REPLY,"The grinding enginry of blood and breath,"
1004,REPLY,"Pain’s random darts, the heartless spade of death:"
1005,REPLY,"All is but grief, and heavily we call"
1006,REPLY,On the last terror for the end of all.
1007,REPLY,
1008,REPLY,Then comes the happy moment: not a stir
1009,REPLY,"In any tree, no portent in the sky:"
1010,REPLY,"The morn doth neither hasten nor defer,"
1011,REPLY,"The morrow hath no name to call it by,"
1012,REPLY,"But life and joy are one,—we know not why,—"
1013,REPLY,As though our very blood long breathless lain
1014,REPLY,Had tasted of the breath of God again.
1015,REPLY,
1016,REPLY,"And having tasted it I speak of it,"
1017,REPLY,And praise him telling how I trembled then
1018,REPLY,"When his touch strengthened me, as now I sit"
1019,REPLY,"In wonder, reaching out beyond my ken,"
1020,REPLY,"Reaching to turn the day back, and my pen"
1021,REPLY,Urging to tell a tale which told would seem
1022,REPLY,The witless phantasy of them that dream.
1023,REPLY,
1024,REPLY,"But O most blessèd truth, for truth thou art,"
1025,REPLY,Abide thou with me till my life shall end.
1026,REPLY,Divinity hath surely touched my heart;
1027,REPLY,I have possessed more joy than earth can lend:
1028,REPLY,I may attain what time shall never spend.
1029,REPLY,Only let not my duller days destroy
1030,REPLY,The memory of thy witness and my joy.
1031,REPLY,
1032,REPLY,
1033,REPLY,
1034,REPLY,
1035,REPLY,O My vague desires!
1036,REPLY,"Ye lambent flames of the soul, her offspring fires:"
1037,REPLY,That are my soul herself in pangs sublime
1038,REPLY,Rising and flying to heaven before her time:
1039,REPLY,
1040,REPLY,What doth tempt you forth
1041,REPLY,To drown in the south or shiver in the frosty north?
1042,REPLY,"What seek ye or find ye in your random flying,"
1043,REPLY,"Ever soaring aloft, soaring and dying?"
1044,REPLY,
1045,REPLY,"Joy, the joy of flight!"
1046,REPLY,"They hide in the sun, they flare and dance in the night;"
1047,REPLY,"Gone up, gone out of sight: and ever again"
1048,REPLY,"Follow fresh tongues of fire, fresh pangs of pain."
1049,REPLY,
1050,REPLY,"Ah! they burn my soul,"
1051,REPLY,"The fires, devour my soul that once was whole:"
1052,REPLY,"She is scattered in fiery phantoms day by day,"
1053,REPLY,"But whither, whither? ay whither? away, away!"
1054,REPLY,
1055,REPLY,Could I but control
1056,REPLY,"These vague desires, these leaping flames of the soul:"
1057,REPLY,Could I but quench the fire: ah! could I stay
1058,REPLY,"My soul that flieth, alas, and dieth away!"
1059,REPLY,
1060,REPLY,
1061,REPLY,
1062,REPLY,
1063,REPLY,The full moon from her cloudless skies
1064,REPLY,"Turneth her face, I think, on me;"
1065,REPLY,And from the hour when she doth rise
1066,REPLY,"Till when she sets, none else will see."
1067,REPLY,
1068,REPLY,"One only other ray she hath,"
1069,REPLY,"That makes an angle close with mine,"
1070,REPLY,And glancing down its happy path
1071,REPLY,Upon another spot doth shine.
1072,REPLY,
1073,REPLY,"But that ray too is sent to me,"
1074,REPLY,For where it lights there dwells my heart:
1075,REPLY,"And if I were where I would be,"
1076,REPLY,"Both rays would shine, love, where thou art."
1077,REPLY,
1078,REPLY,
1079,REPLY,
1080,REPLY,
1081,REPLY,"I praise the tender flower,"
1082,REPLY,That on a mournful day
1083,REPLY,Bloomed in my garden bower
1084,REPLY,And made the winter gay.
1085,REPLY,Its loveliness contented
1086,REPLY,My heart tormented.
1087,REPLY,
1088,REPLY,I praise the gentle maid
1089,REPLY,Whose happy voice and smile
1090,REPLY,To confidence betrayed
1091,REPLY,My doleful heart awhile:
1092,REPLY,And gave my spirit deploring
1093,REPLY,Fresh wings for soaring.
1094,REPLY,
1095,REPLY,The maid for very fear
1096,REPLY,Of love I durst not tell:
1097,REPLY,"The rose could never hear,"
1098,REPLY,Though I bespake her well:
1099,REPLY,So in my song I bind them
1100,REPLY,For all to find them.
1101,REPLY,
1102,REPLY,
1103,REPLY,
1104,REPLY,
1105,REPLY,"Awake my heart to be loved, awake, awake!"
1106,REPLY,"The darkness silvers away, the morn doth break,"
1107,REPLY,It leaps in the sky: unrisen lustres slake
1108,REPLY,"The o’ertaken moon. Awake, O heart, awake!"
1109,REPLY,
1110,REPLY,She too that loveth awaketh and hopes for thee:
1111,REPLY,"Her eyes already have sped the shades that flee,"
1112,REPLY,Already they watch the path thy feet shall take:
1113,REPLY,"Awake, O heart, to be loved, awake, awake!"
1114,REPLY,
1115,REPLY,"And if thou tarry from her,—if this could be,—"
1116,REPLY,"She cometh herself, O heart, to be loved, to thee;"
1117,REPLY,For thee would unashamèd herself forsake:
1118,REPLY,"Awake to be loved, my heart, awake, awake!"
1119,REPLY,
1120,REPLY,"Awake, the land is scattered with light, and see,"
1121,REPLY,Uncanopied sleep is flying from field and tree:
1122,REPLY,And blossoming boughs of April in laughter shake;
1123,REPLY,"Awake, O heart, to be loved, awake, awake!"
1124,REPLY,
1125,REPLY,Lo all things wake and tarry and look for thee:
1126,REPLY,"She looketh and saith, “O sun now bring him to me."
1127,REPLY,"Come more adored, O adored, for his coming’s sake,"
1128,REPLY,"And awake my heart to be loved: awake, awake!”"
1129,REPLY,
1130,REPLY,
1131,REPLY,
1132,REPLY,
1133,REPLY,Who that hath ever shot a shaft at heaven
1134,REPLY,"Whether of wonder, praise or humble prayer,"
1135,REPLY,"But hath not straight received his answer given,"
1136,REPLY,"And been made strong with comforting, aware"
1137,REPLY,"Of strength and beauty for his purpose meant,"
1138,REPLY,Whether it were a lark’s song or a scent
1139,REPLY,That wanders on the quavering paths of the air?
1140,REPLY,
1141,REPLY,"The sweetest of all birds, that fed my slumber"
1142,REPLY,"With music through the thought-exalting night,"
1143,REPLY,Among forgotten fancies without number
1144,REPLY,Transfigured sorrow to a heart’s delight.
1145,REPLY,"And uninvited memories, that stole"
1146,REPLY,With haunting trouble to their slavèd soul
1147,REPLY,Were turned to wondrous joys and aspects bright.
1148,REPLY,
1149,REPLY,So intimate a part are we of Nature
1150,REPLY,"That even to call us best part doth us wrong,"
1151,REPLY,"Being her mind, the meaning of her feature,"
1152,REPLY,To whom her varied forms wholly belong.
1153,REPLY,"So that what were not ours were worthless quite,"
1154,REPLY,And thus to me it happened on that night
1155,REPLY,To be the love and joy of this bird’s song.
1156,REPLY,
1157,REPLY,As it came leaping on the dark unguarded
1158,REPLY,Silence of midnight to the door of the ear:
1159,REPLY,And finding the warm passages unwarded
1160,REPLY,"Sped up the spiral stair, and mounted near"
1161,REPLY,To where in unseen rooms the delicate sprite
1162,REPLY,That never sleeps sat watching through the night
1163,REPLY,Weaving the time in fancies strange and drear.
1164,REPLY,
1165,REPLY,Nor was it that the heavenly music fluttered
1166,REPLY,"The quick electric atoms; rarer far,"
1167,REPLY,The melody this bird of passion uttered
1168,REPLY,Coloured the firmament where all thoughts are:
1169,REPLY,As in the characters a poet’s hand
1170,REPLY,"Has traced, there lie—for poets understand—"
1171,REPLY,Heart-thrills that shoot through blackness like a star.
1172,REPLY,
1173,REPLY,"And so, as summer eve will sweetly soften"
1174,REPLY,"The wayward thoughts of all who forth may fare,"
1175,REPLY,To me there came the spirit who haunts not often
1176,REPLY,My heart for sorrow of the sadness there:
1177,REPLY,"But now her face was lit with joy, her eyes"
1178,REPLY,Were eager messengers of her surprise
1179,REPLY,That she was quit of her profound despair.
1180,REPLY,
1181,REPLY,"Clothed was she like a nun, and yet her vesture"
1182,REPLY,"Did sad despite unto her merry grace,"
1183,REPLY,As gaily she came forward with a gesture
1184,REPLY,"As gamesome as the childhood in her face,"
1185,REPLY,"That I had seen so long downcast and sad,"
1186,REPLY,"Robbed of the happy birthright which she had,"
1187,REPLY,Which earth may steal away but not replace.
1188,REPLY,
1189,REPLY,"There is no sorrow like the slow heart-searing,"
1190,REPLY,When phantoms bred of earth spring up between
1191,REPLY,"Two loving hearts, who grew to their endearing,"
1192,REPLY,When all their pushing tendrils yet were green:
1193,REPLY,No time-struck ruin is so sad to see
1194,REPLY,"As youth’s disease: than thus, O Love, to be,"
1195,REPLY,’Twere better for thy honour not to have been.
1196,REPLY,
1197,REPLY,"Had I not seen the servitude of folly,"
1198,REPLY,"The mínute-measuring of days and nights,"
1199,REPLY,With superstition preaching melancholy
1200,REPLY,And pleasure counterfeiting her own rights;
1201,REPLY,"Afraid to turn again and look behind,"
1202,REPLY,"Lest truth should flame and overwhelm the mind,"
1203,REPLY,Fanning her red regret of old delights.
1204,REPLY,
1205,REPLY,The mimicry of woe that is a trouble
1206,REPLY,"To them that practise it, but which to those"
1207,REPLY,To whom the joy is owed makes sorrow double
1208,REPLY,Seeing the debtor destitute that owes.
1209,REPLY,"The tinselling of cruel bars, to blind"
1210,REPLY,The cagèd bird to think the hand is kind
1211,REPLY,Which liberty denies and food bestows.
1212,REPLY,
1213,REPLY,"From which I hurried as a beast from burning,"
1214,REPLY,Nor cared in flying where my terror led;
1215,REPLY,"Only beyond recall and past returning,"
1216,REPLY,Nor now repent if then too far I fled.—
1217,REPLY,"So long, dear life, as in my flesh thou reign’st"
1218,REPLY,"I will sin with thee rather than against,"
1219,REPLY,Let me die living rather than live dead.
1220,REPLY,
1221,REPLY,But neither is there human pleasure rarer
1222,REPLY,"Than love’s renewal after long disdain,"
1223,REPLY,Nor any touching tale for telling fairer
1224,REPLY,Than that wherein lost lovers meet again:
1225,REPLY,"Such joy must happy souls beyond the grave,"
1226,REPLY,"If once again they meet, in Heaven have,"
1227,REPLY,Without which all the joys of Heaven were vain.
1228,REPLY,
1229,REPLY,"’Twas even thus she came and in my dreaming,"
1230,REPLY,My pleasure was not less than Heaven’s may be:
1231,REPLY,The spiritual and unearthly seeming
1232,REPLY,So far outdid a touched reality:
1233,REPLY,As glances sent in love do more than tell
1234,REPLY,"What words can never phrase or utter well,"
1235,REPLY,And which ’tis shame and blindness not to see.
1236,REPLY,
1237,REPLY,"But now the joy was mine, for gentle pity"
1238,REPLY,Of her who wearily lived long alone
1239,REPLY,With mopes and mummers in a sensuous city
1240,REPLY,"That held no passion equal to her own,"
1241,REPLY,"For gentle pity, I say, constrained me well,"
1242,REPLY,As pains those separated souls they tell
1243,REPLY,"Prepare for Heaven, and mould their hearts of stone."
1244,REPLY,
1245,REPLY,But their sweet ecstasy is all abiding
1246,REPLY,"And cannot pall with time nor tire nor fade,"
1247,REPLY,"Nor any more can day of death, dividing"
1248,REPLY,"Their earthborn loves, those happy haunts invade."
1249,REPLY,But joy for ever—if that joy compare
1250,REPLY,"With my best joy on earth, may I be there!"
1251,REPLY,Though even from that I shrink and am afraid.
1252,REPLY,
1253,REPLY,"Now when I woke and thought upon this vision,"
1254,REPLY,"Wherein she smiled on me and I on her,"
1255,REPLY,I could not quite be clear of all misprision
1256,REPLY,Who of us most was changed: or if it were
1257,REPLY,The song I heard not—sleeping as I heard—
1258,REPLY,"That shaped our empty dream, while sang the bird"
1259,REPLY,Regardless of his fond interpreter.
