72,HART-LEAP WELL,HART-LEAP WELL
73,HART-LEAP WELL,
74,HART-LEAP WELL,"Hart-Leap Well is a small spring of water, about five miles from"
75,HART-LEAP WELL,"Richmond in Yorkshire, and near the side of the road which leads"
76,HART-LEAP WELL,"from Richmond to Askrigg. Its name is derived from a remarkable chase,"
77,HART-LEAP WELL,the memory of which is preserved by the monuments spoken of in the
78,HART-LEAP WELL,"second Part of the following Poem, which monuments do now exist as I"
79,HART-LEAP WELL,have there described them.
80,HART-LEAP WELL,
81,HART-LEAP WELL,
82,HART-LEAP WELL,The Knight had ridden down from Wensley moor
83,HART-LEAP WELL,With the slow motion of a summer's cloud;
84,HART-LEAP WELL,"He turn'd aside towards a Vassal's door,"
85,HART-LEAP WELL,"And, ""Bring another Horse!"" he cried aloud."
86,HART-LEAP WELL,
87,HART-LEAP WELL,"""Another Horse!""--That shout the Vassal heard,"
88,HART-LEAP WELL,"And saddled his best steed, a comely Grey;"
89,HART-LEAP WELL,Sir Walter mounted him; he was the third
90,HART-LEAP WELL,Which he had mounted on that glorious day.
91,HART-LEAP WELL,
92,HART-LEAP WELL,Joy sparkeled in the prancing Courser's eyes;
93,HART-LEAP WELL,The horse and horsemen are a happy pair;
94,HART-LEAP WELL,"But, though Sir Walter like a falcon flies,"
95,HART-LEAP WELL,There is a doleful silence in the air.
96,HART-LEAP WELL,
97,HART-LEAP WELL,"A rout this morning left Sir Walter's Hall,"
98,HART-LEAP WELL,That as they gallop'd made the echoes roar;
99,HART-LEAP WELL,"But horse and man are vanish'd, one and all;"
100,HART-LEAP WELL,"Such race, I think, was never seen before."
101,HART-LEAP WELL,
102,HART-LEAP WELL,"Sir Walter, restless as a veering wind,"
103,HART-LEAP WELL,Calls to the few tired dogs that yet remain:
104,HART-LEAP WELL,"Brach, Swift and Music, noblest of their kind,"
105,HART-LEAP WELL,"Follow, and weary up the mountain strain."
106,HART-LEAP WELL,
107,HART-LEAP WELL,"The Knight halloo'd, he chid and cheer'd them on"
108,HART-LEAP WELL,With suppliant gestures and upbraidings stern;
109,HART-LEAP WELL,"But breath and eye-sight fail, and, one by one,"
110,HART-LEAP WELL,The dogs are stretch'd among the mountain fern.
111,HART-LEAP WELL,
112,HART-LEAP WELL,"Where is the throng, the tumult of the chace?"
113,HART-LEAP WELL,The bugles that so joyfully were blown?
114,HART-LEAP WELL,--This race it looks not like an earthly race;
115,HART-LEAP WELL,Sir Walter and the Hart are left alone.
116,HART-LEAP WELL,
117,HART-LEAP WELL,The poor Hart toils along the mountain side;
118,HART-LEAP WELL,"I will not stop to tell how far he fled,"
119,HART-LEAP WELL,Nor will I mention by what death he died;
120,HART-LEAP WELL,But now the Knight beholds him lying dead.
121,HART-LEAP WELL,
122,HART-LEAP WELL,"Dismounting then, he lean'd against a thorn;"
123,HART-LEAP WELL,"He had no follower, dog, nor man, nor boy:"
124,HART-LEAP WELL,"He neither smack'd his whip, nor blew his horn,"
125,HART-LEAP WELL,But gaz'd upon the spoil with silent joy.
126,HART-LEAP WELL,
127,HART-LEAP WELL,"Close to the thorn on which Sir Walter lean'd,"
128,HART-LEAP WELL,Stood his dumb partner in this glorious act;
129,HART-LEAP WELL,"Weak as a lamb the hour that it is yean'd,"
130,HART-LEAP WELL,And foaming like a mountain cataract.
131,HART-LEAP WELL,
132,HART-LEAP WELL,Upon his side the Hart was lying stretch'd:
133,HART-LEAP WELL,"His nose half-touch'd a spring beneath a hill,"
134,HART-LEAP WELL,And with the last deep groan his breath had fetch'd
135,HART-LEAP WELL,The waters of the spring were trembling still.
136,HART-LEAP WELL,
137,HART-LEAP WELL,"And now, too happy for repose or rest,"
138,HART-LEAP WELL,"Was never man in such a joyful case,"
139,HART-LEAP WELL,"Sir Walter walk'd all round, north, south and west,"
140,HART-LEAP WELL,"And gaz'd, and gaz'd upon that darling place."
141,HART-LEAP WELL,
142,HART-LEAP WELL,"And turning up the hill, it was at least"
143,HART-LEAP WELL,"Nine roods of sheer ascent, Sir Walter found"
144,HART-LEAP WELL,Three several marks which with his hoofs the beast
145,HART-LEAP WELL,Had left imprinted on the verdant ground.
146,HART-LEAP WELL,
147,HART-LEAP WELL,"Sir Walter wiped his face, and cried, ""Till now"
148,HART-LEAP WELL,Such sight was never seen by living eyes:
149,HART-LEAP WELL,"Three leaps have borne him from this lofty brow,"
150,HART-LEAP WELL,"Down to the very fountain where he lies."""
151,HART-LEAP WELL,
152,HART-LEAP WELL,"I'll build a Pleasure-house upon this spot,"
153,HART-LEAP WELL,"And a small Arbour, made for rural joy;"
154,HART-LEAP WELL,"Twill be the traveller's shed, the pilgrim's cot,"
155,HART-LEAP WELL,A place of love for damsels that are coy.
156,HART-LEAP WELL,
157,HART-LEAP WELL,A cunning Artist will I have to frame
158,HART-LEAP WELL,A bason for that fountain in the dell;
159,HART-LEAP WELL,"And they, who do make mention of the same,"
160,HART-LEAP WELL,"From this day forth, shall call it Hart-leap Well."
161,HART-LEAP WELL,
162,HART-LEAP WELL,"And, gallant brute! to make thy praises known,"
163,HART-LEAP WELL,Another monument shall here be rais'd;
164,HART-LEAP WELL,"Three several pillars, each a rough hewn stone,"
165,HART-LEAP WELL,And planted where thy hoofs the turf have graz'd.
166,HART-LEAP WELL,
167,HART-LEAP WELL,"And in the summer-time when days are long,"
168,HART-LEAP WELL,"I will come hither with my paramour,"
169,HART-LEAP WELL,"And with the dancers, and the minstrel's song,"
170,HART-LEAP WELL,We will make merry in that pleasant bower.
171,HART-LEAP WELL,
172,HART-LEAP WELL,Till the foundations of the mountains fail
173,HART-LEAP WELL,"My mansion with its arbour shall endure,"
174,HART-LEAP WELL,"--The joy of them who till the fields of Swale,"
175,HART-LEAP WELL,And them who dwell among the woods of Ure.
176,HART-LEAP WELL,
177,HART-LEAP WELL,"Then home he went, and left the Hart, stone-dead,"
178,HART-LEAP WELL,With breathless nostrils stretch'd above the spring.
179,HART-LEAP WELL,"And soon the Knight perform'd what he had said,"
180,HART-LEAP WELL,The fame whereof through many a land did ring.
181,HART-LEAP WELL,
182,HART-LEAP WELL,"Ere thrice the moon into her port had steer'd,"
183,HART-LEAP WELL,A cup of stone receiv'd the living well;
184,HART-LEAP WELL,"Three pillars of rude stone Sir Walter rear'd,"
185,HART-LEAP WELL,And built a house of pleasure in the dell.
186,HART-LEAP WELL,
187,HART-LEAP WELL,"And near the fountain, flowers of stature tall"
188,HART-LEAP WELL,"With trailing plants and trees were intertwin'd,"
189,HART-LEAP WELL,"Which soon composed a little sylvan hall,"
190,HART-LEAP WELL,A leafy shelter from the sun and wind.
191,HART-LEAP WELL,
192,HART-LEAP WELL,"And thither, when the summer days were long,"
193,HART-LEAP WELL,Sir Walter journey'd with his paramour;
194,HART-LEAP WELL,And with the dancers and the minstrel's song
195,HART-LEAP WELL,Made merriment within that pleasant bower.
196,HART-LEAP WELL,
197,HART-LEAP WELL,"The Knight, Sir Walter, died in course of time,"
198,HART-LEAP WELL,And his bones lie in his paternal vale.--
199,HART-LEAP WELL,"But there is matter for a second rhyme,"
200,HART-LEAP WELL,And I to this would add another tale.
201,HART-LEAP WELL,
202,HART-LEAP WELL,
203,HART-LEAP WELL,
204,_PART SECOND_.,_PART SECOND_.
205,_PART SECOND_.,
206,_PART SECOND_.,The moving accident is not my trade.
207,_PART SECOND_.,To curl the blood I have no ready arts;
208,_PART SECOND_.,"'Tis my delight, alone in summer shade,"
209,_PART SECOND_.,"To pipe a simple song to thinking hearts,"
210,_PART SECOND_.,
211,_PART SECOND_.,"As I from Hawes to Richmond did repair,"
212,_PART SECOND_.,It chanc'd that I saw standing in a dell
213,_PART SECOND_.,"Three aspins at three corners of a square,"
214,_PART SECOND_.,"And one, not four yards distant, near a well."
215,_PART SECOND_.,
216,_PART SECOND_.,"What this imported I could ill divine,"
217,_PART SECOND_.,"And, pulling now the rein my horse to stop,"
218,_PART SECOND_.,"I saw three pillars standing in a line,"
219,_PART SECOND_.,The last stone pillar on a dark hill-top.
220,_PART SECOND_.,
221,_PART SECOND_.,"The trees were grey, with neither arms nor head;"
222,_PART SECOND_.,Half-wasted the square mound of tawny green;
223,_PART SECOND_.,"So that you just might say, as then I said,"
224,_PART SECOND_.,"""Here in old time the hand of man has been."""
225,_PART SECOND_.,
226,_PART SECOND_.,I look'd upon the hills both far and near;
227,_PART SECOND_.,More doleful place did never eye survey;
228,_PART SECOND_.,"It seem'd as if the spring-time came not here,"
229,_PART SECOND_.,And Nature here were willing to decay.
230,_PART SECOND_.,
231,_PART SECOND_.,"I stood in various thoughts and fancies lost,"
232,_PART SECOND_.,"When one who was in Shepherd's garb attir'd,"
233,_PART SECOND_.,"Came up the hollow. Him did I accost,"
234,_PART SECOND_.,And what this place might be I then inquir'd.
235,_PART SECOND_.,
236,_PART SECOND_.,"The Shepherd stopp'd, and that same story told"
237,_PART SECOND_.,Which in my former rhyme I have rehears'd.
238,_PART SECOND_.,"""A jolly place,"" said he, ""in times of old,"
239,_PART SECOND_.,"But something ails it now; the spot is curs'd."""
240,_PART SECOND_.,
241,_PART SECOND_.,"You see these lifeless stumps of aspin wood,"
242,_PART SECOND_.,"Some say that they are beeches, others elms,"
243,_PART SECOND_.,"These were the Bower; and here a Mansion stood,"
244,_PART SECOND_.,The finest palace of a hundred realms.
245,_PART SECOND_.,
246,_PART SECOND_.,"The arbour does its own condition tell,"
247,_PART SECOND_.,"You see the stones, the fountain, and the stream,"
248,_PART SECOND_.,"But as to the great Lodge, you might as well"
249,_PART SECOND_.,Hunt half a day for a forgotten dream.
250,_PART SECOND_.,
251,_PART SECOND_.,"There's neither dog nor heifer, horse nor sheep,"
252,_PART SECOND_.,Will wet his lips within that cup of stone;
253,_PART SECOND_.,"And, oftentimes, when all are fast asleep,"
254,_PART SECOND_.,This water doth send forth a dolorous groan.
255,_PART SECOND_.,
256,_PART SECOND_.,"Some say that here a murder has been done,"
257,_PART SECOND_.,"And blood cries out for blood: but, for my part,"
258,_PART SECOND_.,"I've guess'd, when I've been sitting in the sun,"
259,_PART SECOND_.,That it was all for that unhappy Hart.
260,_PART SECOND_.,
261,_PART SECOND_.,What thoughts must through the creature's brain have pass'd!
262,_PART SECOND_.,To this place from the stone upon the steep
263,_PART SECOND_.,"Are but three bounds, and look, Sir, at this last!"
264,_PART SECOND_.,O Master! it has been a cruel leap.
265,_PART SECOND_.,
266,_PART SECOND_.,For thirteen hours he ran a desperate race;
267,_PART SECOND_.,And in my simple mind we cannot tell
268,_PART SECOND_.,"What cause the Hart might have to love this place,"
269,_PART SECOND_.,And come and make his death-bed near the well.
270,_PART SECOND_.,
271,_PART SECOND_.,"Here on the grass perhaps asleep he sank,"
272,_PART SECOND_.,Lull'd by this fountain in the summer-tide;
273,_PART SECOND_.,This water was perhaps the first he drank
274,_PART SECOND_.,When he had wander'd from his mother's side.
275,_PART SECOND_.,
276,_PART SECOND_.,In April here beneath the scented thorn
277,_PART SECOND_.,"He heard the birds their morning carols sing,"
278,_PART SECOND_.,"And he, perhaps, for aught we know, was born"
279,_PART SECOND_.,Not half a furlong from that self-same spring.
280,_PART SECOND_.,
281,_PART SECOND_.,But now here's neither grass nor pleasant shade;
282,_PART SECOND_.,The sun on drearier hollow never shone:
283,_PART SECOND_.,"So will it be, as I have often said,"
284,_PART SECOND_.,"Till trees, and stones, and fountain all are gone."
285,_PART SECOND_.,
286,_PART SECOND_.,"Grey-headed Shepherd, thou hast spoken well;"
287,_PART SECOND_.,Small difference lies between thy creed and mine;
288,_PART SECOND_.,"This beast not unobserv'd by Nature fell,"
289,_PART SECOND_.,His death was mourn'd by sympathy divine.
290,_PART SECOND_.,
291,_PART SECOND_.,"The Being, that is in the clouds and air,"
292,_PART SECOND_.,That is in the green leaves among the groves.
293,_PART SECOND_.,Maintains a deep and reverential care
294,_PART SECOND_.,For them the quiet creatures whom he loves.
295,_PART SECOND_.,
296,_PART SECOND_.,"The Pleasure-house is dust:--behind, before,"
297,_PART SECOND_.,"This, is no common waste, no common gloom;"
298,_PART SECOND_.,"But Nature, in due course of time, once more"
299,_PART SECOND_.,Shall here put on her beauty and her bloom.
300,_PART SECOND_.,
301,_PART SECOND_.,She leaves these objects to a slow decay
302,_PART SECOND_.,"That what we are, and have been, may be known;"
303,_PART SECOND_.,"But, at the coming of the milder day,"
304,_PART SECOND_.,These monuments shall all be overgrown.
305,_PART SECOND_.,
306,_PART SECOND_.,"One lesson, Shepherd, let us two divide,"
307,_PART SECOND_.,"Taught both by what she shews, and what conceals,"
308,_PART SECOND_.,Never to blend our pleasure or our pride
309,_PART SECOND_.,With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels.
310,_PART SECOND_.,
311,_PART SECOND_.,
312,_PART SECOND_.,
313,_PART SECOND_.,"There was a Boy, ye knew him well, ye Cliffs"
314,_PART SECOND_.,"And Islands of Winander! many a time,"
315,_PART SECOND_.,"At evening, when the stars had just begun"
316,_PART SECOND_.,"To move along the edges of the hills,"
317,_PART SECOND_.,"Rising or setting, would he stand alone,"
318,_PART SECOND_.,"Beneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake,"
319,_PART SECOND_.,"And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands"
320,_PART SECOND_.,Press'd closely palm to palm and to his mouth
321,_PART SECOND_.,"Uplifted, he, as through an instrument,"
322,_PART SECOND_.,Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls
323,_PART SECOND_.,That they might answer him. And they would shout
324,_PART SECOND_.,Across the wat'ry vale and shout again
325,_PART SECOND_.,"Responsive to his call, with quivering peals,"
326,_PART SECOND_.,"And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud"
327,_PART SECOND_.,"Redoubled and redoubled, a wild scene"
328,_PART SECOND_.,
329,_PART SECOND_.,"Of mirth and jocund din. And, when it chanced"
330,_PART SECOND_.,"That pauses of deep silence mock'd his skill,"
331,_PART SECOND_.,"Then, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung"
332,_PART SECOND_.,"Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprize"
333,_PART SECOND_.,Has carried far into his heart the voice
334,_PART SECOND_.,"Of mountain torrents, or the visible scene"
335,_PART SECOND_.,Would enter unawares into his mind
336,_PART SECOND_.,"With all its solemn imagery, its rocks,"
337,_PART SECOND_.,"Its woods, and that uncertain heaven, receiv'd"
338,_PART SECOND_.,Into the bosom of the steady lake.
339,_PART SECOND_.,
340,_PART SECOND_.,"Fair are the woods, and beauteous is the spot,"
341,_PART SECOND_.,The vale where he was born: the Church-yard hangs
342,_PART SECOND_.,"Upon a slope above the village school,"
343,_PART SECOND_.,And there along that bank when I have pass'd
344,_PART SECOND_.,"At evening, I believe, that near his grave"
345,_PART SECOND_.,"A full half-hour together I have stood,"
346,_PART SECOND_.,Mute--for he died when he was ten years old.

397,A PASTORAL POEM.,Of carded wool--which the old Man had piled
398,A PASTORAL POEM.,"He laid his implements with gentle care,"
399,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Each in the other lock'd; and, down the path"
400,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Which from his cottage to the church-yard led,"
401,A PASTORAL POEM.,"He took his way, impatient to accost"

404,A PASTORAL POEM.,"'Twas one well known to him in former days,"

408,A PASTORAL POEM.,Through twenty seasons; but he had been rear'd
409,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Among the mountains, and he in his heart"
410,A PASTORAL POEM.,Was half a Shepherd on the stormy seas.
411,A PASTORAL POEM.,Oft in the piping shrouds had Leonard heard
412,A PASTORAL POEM.,"The tones of waterfalls, and inland sounds"
413,A PASTORAL POEM.,Of caves and trees; and when the regular wind
414,A PASTORAL POEM.,Between the tropics fill'd the steady sail

420,A PASTORAL POEM.,"And, while the broad green wave and sparkling foam"
421,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Flash'd round him images and hues, that wrought"
422,A PASTORAL POEM.,"In union with the employment of his heart,"
423,A PASTORAL POEM.,"He, thus by feverish passion overcome,"
424,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Even with the organs of his bodily eye,"
425,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Below him, in the bosom of the deep"
426,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Saw mountains, saw the forms of sheep that graz'd"
427,A PASTORAL POEM.,"On verdant hills, with dwellings among trees,"
428,A PASTORAL POEM.,And Shepherds clad in the same country grey
429,A PASTORAL POEM.,Which he himself had worn. [2]

431,A PASTORAL POEM.,[Footnote 2: This description of the Calenture is sketched from an
432,A PASTORAL POEM.,"imperfect recollection of an admirable one in prose, by Mr. Gilbert,"

434,A PASTORAL POEM.,
435,A PASTORAL POEM.,"And now at length,"
436,A PASTORAL POEM.,"From perils manifold, with some small wealth"
437,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Acquir'd by traffic in the Indian Isles,"
438,A PASTORAL POEM.,"To his paternal home he is return'd,"
439,A PASTORAL POEM.,With a determin'd purpose to resume
440,A PASTORAL POEM.,"The life which he liv'd there, both for the sake"
441,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Of many darling pleasures, and the love"
442,A PASTORAL POEM.,Which to an only brother he has borne
443,A PASTORAL POEM.,"In all his hardships, since that happy time"
444,A PASTORAL POEM.,"When, whether it blew foul or fair, they two"
445,A PASTORAL POEM.,Were brother Shepherds on their native hills.
446,A PASTORAL POEM.,"--They were the last of all their race; and now,"
447,A PASTORAL POEM.,"When Leonard had approach'd his home, his heart"
448,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Fail'd in him, and, not venturing to inquire"
449,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Tidings of one whom he so dearly lov'd,"
450,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Towards the church-yard he had turn'd aside,"
451,A PASTORAL POEM.,"That, as he knew in what particular spot"
452,A PASTORAL POEM.,"His family were laid, he thence might learn"
453,A PASTORAL POEM.,"If still his Brother liv'd, or to the file"
454,A PASTORAL POEM.,Another grave was added.--He had found
455,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Another grave, near which a full half hour"
456,A PASTORAL POEM.,"He had remain'd, but, as he gaz'd, there grew"
457,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Such a confusion in his memory,"
458,A PASTORAL POEM.,"That he began to doubt, and he had hopes"
459,A PASTORAL POEM.,"That he had seen this heap of turf before,"
460,A PASTORAL POEM.,"That it was not another grave, but one,"
461,A PASTORAL POEM.,"He had forgotten. He had lost his path,"
462,A PASTORAL POEM.,"As up the vale he came that afternoon,"
463,A PASTORAL POEM.,Through fields which once had been well known to him.
464,A PASTORAL POEM.,And Oh! what joy the recollection now
465,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Sent to his heart! he lifted up his eyes,"
466,A PASTORAL POEM.,And looking round he thought that he perceiv'd
467,A PASTORAL POEM.,Strange alteration wrought on every side
468,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Among the woods and fields, and that the rocks,"
469,A PASTORAL POEM.,"And the eternal hills, themselves were chang'd."
470,A PASTORAL POEM.,
471,A PASTORAL POEM.,By this the Priest who down the field had come
472,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Unseen by Leonard, at the church-yard gate"
473,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Stopp'd short, and thence, at leisure, limb by limb"
474,A PASTORAL POEM.,He scann'd him with a gay complacency.
475,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Aye, thought the Vicar, smiling to himself;"
476,A PASTORAL POEM.,'Tis one of those who needs must leave the path
477,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Of the world's business, to go wild alone:"
478,A PASTORAL POEM.,"His arms have a perpetual holiday,"
479,A PASTORAL POEM.,The happy man will creep about the fields
480,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Following his fancies by the hour, to bring"
481,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Tears down his check, or solitary smiles"
482,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Into his face, until the setting sun"
483,A PASTORAL POEM.,Write Fool upon his forehead. Planted thus
484,A PASTORAL POEM.,Beneath a shed that overarch'd the gate
485,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Of this rude church-yard, till the stars appear'd"
486,A PASTORAL POEM.,The good man might have commun'd with himself
487,A PASTORAL POEM.,"But that the Stranger, who had left the grave,"
488,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Approach'd; he recogniz'd the Priest at once,"
489,A PASTORAL POEM.,"And after greetings interchang'd, and given"
490,A PASTORAL POEM.,By Leonard to the Vicar as to one
491,A PASTORAL POEM.,"Unknown to him, this dialogue ensued."
492,A PASTORAL POEM.,
493,LEONARD.,LEONARD.
494,LEONARD.,
495,LEONARD.,"You live, Sir, in these dales, a quiet life:"
496,LEONARD.,Your years make up one peaceful family;
497,LEONARD.,"And who would grieve and fret, if, welcome come"
498,LEONARD.,"And welcome gone, they are so like each other,"
499,LEONARD.,They cannot be remember'd. Scarce a funeral
500,LEONARD.,"Comes to this church-yard once, in eighteen months;"
501,LEONARD.,"And yet, some changes must take place among you."
502,LEONARD.,"And you, who dwell here, even among these rocks"
503,LEONARD.,"Can trace the finger of mortality,"
504,LEONARD.,"And see, that with our threescore years and ten"
505,LEONARD.,"We are not all that perish.--I remember,"
506,LEONARD.,"For many years ago I pass'd this road,"
507,LEONARD.,There was a foot-way all along the fields
508,LEONARD.,By the brook-side--'tis gone--and that dark cleft!
509,LEONARD.,To me it does not seem to wear the face
510,LEONARD.,Which then it had.
511,LEONARD.,
512,PRIEST.,PRIEST.
513,PRIEST.,
514,PRIEST.,"Why, Sir, for aught I know,"
515,PRIEST.,That chasm is much the same--
516,PRIEST.,
517,LEONARD.,LEONARD.
518,LEONARD.,
519,LEONARD.,"But, surely, yonder--"
520,PRIEST.,PRIEST.
521,PRIEST.,
522,PRIEST.,"Aye, there indeed, your memory is a friend"
523,PRIEST.,"That does not play you false.--On that tall pike,"
524,PRIEST.,(It is the loneliest place of all these hills)
525,PRIEST.,"There were two Springs which bubbled side by side,"
526,PRIEST.,As if they had been made that they might be
527,PRIEST.,"Companions for each other: ten years back,"
528,PRIEST.,"Close to those brother fountains, the huge crag"
529,PRIEST.,"Was rent with lightning--one is dead and gone,"
530,PRIEST.,"The other, left behind, is flowing still.--"
531,PRIEST.,"For accidents and changes such as these,"
532,PRIEST.,Why we have store of them! a water-spout
533,PRIEST.,Will bring down half a mountain; what a feast
534,PRIEST.,"For folks that wander up and down like you,"
535,PRIEST.,To see an acre's breadth of that wide cliff
536,PRIEST.,One roaring cataract--a sharp May storm
537,PRIEST.,"Will come with loads of January snow,"
538,PRIEST.,And in one night send twenty score of sheep
539,PRIEST.,"To feed the ravens, or a Shepherd dies"
540,PRIEST.,By some untoward death among the rocks:
541,PRIEST.,The ice breaks up and sweeps away a bridge--
542,PRIEST.,A wood is fell'd:--and then for our own homes!
543,PRIEST.,"A child is born or christen'd, a field plough'd,"
544,PRIEST.,"A daughter sent to service, a web spun,"
545,PRIEST.,The old house cloth is deck'd with a new face;
546,PRIEST.,"And hence, so far from wanting facts or dates"
547,PRIEST.,"To chronicle the time, we all have here"
548,PRIEST.,"A pair of diaries, one serving, Sir,"
549,PRIEST.,"For the whole dale, and one for each fire-side,"
550,PRIEST.,Your's was a stranger's judgment: for historians
551,PRIEST.,Commend me to these vallies.
552,PRIEST.,
553,LEONARD.,LEONARD.
554,LEONARD.,
555,LEONARD.,Yet your church-yard
556,LEONARD.,"Seems, if such freedom may be used with you,"
557,LEONARD.,To say that you are heedless of the past.
558,LEONARD.,"Here's neither head nor foot-stone, plate of brass,"
559,LEONARD.,"Cross-bones or skull, type of our earthly state"
560,LEONARD.,Or emblem of our hopes: the dead man's home
561,LEONARD.,Is but a fellow to that pasture field.
562,LEONARD.,
563,PRIEST.,PRIEST.
564,PRIEST.,
565,PRIEST.,"Why there, Sir, is a thought that's new to me."
566,PRIEST.,"The Stone-cutters, 'tis true, might beg their bread"
567,PRIEST.,If every English church-yard were like ours:
568,PRIEST.,Yet your conclusion wanders from the truth.
569,PRIEST.,
570,PRIEST.,"We have no need of names and epitaphs,"
571,PRIEST.,We talk about the dead by our fire-sides.
572,PRIEST.,"And then for our immortal part, _we_ want"
573,PRIEST.,"No symbols, Sir, to tell us that plain tale:"
574,PRIEST.,The thought of death sits easy on the man
575,PRIEST.,Who has been born and dies among the mountains:
576,PRIEST.,
577,LEONARD.,LEONARD.
578,LEONARD.,
579,LEONARD.,"Your dalesmen, then, do in each other's thoughts"
580,LEONARD.,Possess a kind of second life: no doubt
581,LEONARD.,"You, Sir, could help me to the history"
582,LEONARD.,Of half these Graves?
583,LEONARD.,
584,PRIEST.,PRIEST.
585,PRIEST.,
586,PRIEST.,"With what I've witness'd; and with what I've heard,"
587,PRIEST.,"Perhaps I might, and, on a winter's evening,"
588,PRIEST.,If you were seated at my chimney's nook
589,PRIEST.,"By turning o'er these hillocks one by one,"
590,PRIEST.,"We two could travel, Sir, through a strange round,"
591,PRIEST.,Yet all in the broad high-way of the world.
592,PRIEST.,"Now there's a grave--your foot is half upon it,"
593,PRIEST.,"It looks just like the rest, and yet that man"
594,PRIEST.,Died broken-hearted.
595,PRIEST.,
596,LEONARD.,LEONARD.
597,LEONARD.,
598,LEONARD.,"'Tis a common case,"
599,LEONARD.,We'll take another: who is he that lies
600,LEONARD.,"Beneath yon ridge, the last of those three graves;--"
601,LEONARD.,It touches on that piece of native rock
602,LEONARD.,Left in the church-yard wall.
603,LEONARD.,
604,PRIEST.,PRIEST.
605,PRIEST.,
606,PRIEST.,That's Walter Ewbank.
607,PRIEST.,He had as white a head and fresh a cheek
608,PRIEST.,As ever were produc'd by youth and age
609,PRIEST.,Engendering in the blood of hale fourscore.
610,PRIEST.,For five long generations had the heart
611,PRIEST.,Of Walter's forefathers o'erflow'd the bounds
612,PRIEST.,"Of their inheritance, that single cottage,"
613,PRIEST.,"You see it yonder, and those few green fields."
614,PRIEST.,"They toil'd and wrought, and still, from sire to son,"
615,PRIEST.,"Each struggled, and each yielded as before"
616,PRIEST.,"A little--yet a little--and old Walter,"
617,PRIEST.,"They left to him the family heart, and land"
618,PRIEST.,With other burthens than the crop it bore.
619,PRIEST.,Year after year the old man still preserv'd
620,PRIEST.,"A chearful mind, and buffeted with bond,"
621,PRIEST.,"Interest and mortgages; at last he sank,"
622,PRIEST.,And went into his grave before his time.
623,PRIEST.,Poor Walter! whether it was care that spurr'd him
624,PRIEST.,"God only knows, but to the very last"
625,PRIEST.,He had the lightest foot in Ennerdale:
626,PRIEST.,His pace was never that of an old man:
627,PRIEST.,I almost see him tripping down the path
628,PRIEST.,"With his two Grandsons after him--but you,"
629,PRIEST.,"Unless our Landlord be your host to-night,"
630,PRIEST.,"Have far to travel, and in these rough paths"
631,PRIEST.,Even in the longest day of midsummer--
632,PRIEST.,
633,LEONARD.,LEONARD.
634,LEONARD.,
635,LEONARD.,But these two Orphans!
636,LEONARD.,
637,PRIEST.,PRIEST.
638,PRIEST.,
639,PRIEST.,Orphans! such they were--
640,PRIEST.,"Yet not while Walter liv'd--for, though their Parents"
641,PRIEST.,"Lay buried side by side as now they lie,"
642,PRIEST.,"The old Man was a father to the boys,"
643,PRIEST.,Two fathers in one father: and if tears
644,PRIEST.,"Shed, when he talk'd of them where they were not,"
645,PRIEST.,"And hauntings from the infirmity of love,"
646,PRIEST.,"Are aught of what makes up a mother's heart,"
647,PRIEST.,This old Man in the day of his old age
648,PRIEST.,"Was half a mother to them.--If you weep, Sir,"
649,PRIEST.,"To hear a stranger talking about strangers,"
650,PRIEST.,Heaven bless you when you are among your kindred!
651,PRIEST.,Aye. You may turn that way--it is a grave
652,PRIEST.,Which will bear looking at.
653,PRIEST.,
654,LEONARD.,LEONARD.
655,LEONARD.,
656,LEONARD.,These Boys I hope
657,LEONARD.,They lov'd this good old Man--
658,LEONARD.,
659,PRIEST.,PRIEST.
660,PRIEST.,
661,PRIEST.,"They did--and truly,"
662,PRIEST.,"But that was what we almost overlook'd,"
663,PRIEST.,They were such darlings of each other. For
664,PRIEST.,"Though from their cradles they had liv'd with Walter,"
665,PRIEST.,"The only kinsman near them in the house,"
666,PRIEST.,"Yet he being old, they had much love to spare,"
667,PRIEST.,And it all went into each other's hearts.
668,PRIEST.,"Leonard, the elder by just eighteen months,"
669,PRIEST.,"Was two years taller: 'twas a joy to see,"
670,PRIEST.,"To hear, to meet them! from their house the School"
671,PRIEST.,"Was distant three short miles, and in the time"
672,PRIEST.,"Of storm and thaw, when every water-course"
673,PRIEST.,"And unbridg'd stream, such as you may have notic'd"
674,PRIEST.,"Crossing our roads at every hundred steps,"
675,PRIEST.,"Was swoln into a noisy rivulet,"
676,PRIEST.,"Would Leonard then, when elder boys perhaps"
677,PRIEST.,"Remain'd at home, go staggering through the fords"
678,PRIEST.,"Bearing his Brother on his back.--I've seen him,"
679,PRIEST.,"On windy days, in one of those stray brooks,"
680,PRIEST.,"Aye, more than once I've seen him mid-leg deep,"
681,PRIEST.,Their two books lying both on a dry stone
682,PRIEST.,"Upon the hither side:--and once I said,"
683,PRIEST.,"As I remember, looking round these rocks"
684,PRIEST.,"And hills on which we all of us were born,"
685,PRIEST.,That God who made the great book of the world
686,PRIEST.,Would bless such piety--
687,PRIEST.,
688,LEONARD.,LEONARD.
689,LEONARD.,
690,LEONARD.,It may be then--
691,LEONARD.,
692,PRIEST.,PRIEST.
693,PRIEST.,
694,PRIEST.,Never did worthier lads break English bread:
695,PRIEST.,"The finest Sunday that the Autumn saw,"
696,PRIEST.,"With all its mealy clusters of ripe nuts,"
697,PRIEST.,"Could never keep these boys away from church,"
698,PRIEST.,Or tempt them to an hour of sabbath breach.
699,PRIEST.,"Leonard and James! I warrant, every corner"
700,PRIEST.,Among these rocks and every hollow place
701,PRIEST.,"Where foot could come, to one or both of them"
702,PRIEST.,Was known as well as to the flowers that grew there.
703,PRIEST.,Like roe-bucks they went bounding o'er the hills:
704,PRIEST.,They play'd like two young ravens on the crags:
705,PRIEST.,"Then they could write, aye and speak too, as well"
706,PRIEST.,As many of their betters--and for Leonard!
707,PRIEST.,"The very night before he went away,"
708,PRIEST.,In my own house I put into his hand
709,PRIEST.,"A Bible, and I'd wager twenty pounds,"
710,PRIEST.,"That, if he is alive, he has it yet."
711,PRIEST.,
712,LEONARD.,LEONARD.
713,LEONARD.,
714,LEONARD.,"It seems, these Brothers have not liv'd to be"
715,LEONARD.,A comfort to each other.--
716,LEONARD.,
717,PRIEST.,PRIEST.
718,PRIEST.,
719,PRIEST.,That they might
720,PRIEST.,"Live to that end, is what both old and young"
721,PRIEST.,"In this our valley all of us have wish'd,"
722,PRIEST.,"And what, for my part, I have often pray'd:"
723,PRIEST.,But Leonard--
724,PRIEST.,
725,LEONARD.,LEONARD.
726,LEONARD.,
727,LEONARD.,Then James still is left among you--
728,LEONARD.,
729,PRIEST.,PRIEST.
730,PRIEST.,
731,PRIEST.,'Tis of the elder Brother I am speaking:
732,PRIEST.,"They had an Uncle, he was at that time"
733,PRIEST.,"A thriving man, and traffick'd on the seas:"
734,PRIEST.,"And, but for this same Uncle, to this hour"
735,PRIEST.,Leonard had never handled rope or shroud.
736,PRIEST.,For the Boy lov'd the life which we lead here;
737,PRIEST.,"And, though a very Stripling, twelve years old;"
738,PRIEST.,His soul was knit to this his native soil.
739,PRIEST.,"But, as I said, old Walter was too weak"
740,PRIEST.,"To strive with such a torrent; when he died,"
741,PRIEST.,"The estate and house were sold, and all their sheep,"
742,PRIEST.,"A pretty flock, and which, for aught I know,"
743,PRIEST.,Had clothed the Ewbauks for a thousand years.
744,PRIEST.,"Well--all was gone, and they were destitute."
745,PRIEST.,"And Leonard, chiefly for his brother's sake,"
746,PRIEST.,Resolv'd to try his fortune on the seas.
747,PRIEST.,'Tis now twelve years since we had tidings from him.
748,PRIEST.,If there was one among us who had heard
749,PRIEST.,"That Leonard Ewbank was come home again,"
750,PRIEST.,"From the great Gavel [3], down by Leeza's Banks,"
751,PRIEST.,"And down the Enna, far as Egremont,"
752,PRIEST.,"The day would be a very festival,"
753,PRIEST.,"And those two bells of ours, which there you see"
754,PRIEST.,"Hanging in the open air--but, O good Sir!"
755,PRIEST.,This is sad talk--they'll never sound for him
756,PRIEST.,Living or dead--When last we heard of him
757,PRIEST.,He was in slavery among the Moors
758,PRIEST.,Upon the Barbary Coast--'Twas not a little
759,PRIEST.,"That would bring down his spirit, and, no doubt,"
760,PRIEST.,"Before it ended in his death, the Lad"
761,PRIEST.,"Was sadly cross'd--Poor Leonard! when we parted,"
762,PRIEST.,"He took me by the hand and said to me,"
763,PRIEST.,"If ever the day came when he was rich,"
764,PRIEST.,"He would return, and on his Father's Land"
765,PRIEST.,He would grow old among us.
766,PRIEST.,
767,PRIEST.,"[Footnote 3: The great Gavel, so called I imagine, from its"
768,PRIEST.,"resemblance to the Gable end of a house, is one of the highest of"
769,PRIEST.,the Cumberland mountains. It stands at the head of the several vales
770,PRIEST.,"of Ennerdale, Wastdale, and Borrowdale."
771,PRIEST.,
772,PRIEST.,The Leeza is a River which follows into the Lake of Ennerdale: on
773,PRIEST.,"issuing from the Lake, it changes its name, and is called the End,"
774,PRIEST.,"Eyne, or Enna. It falls into the sea a little below Egremont.]"
775,PRIEST.,
776,LEONARD.,LEONARD.
777,LEONARD.,
778,LEONARD.,If that day
779,LEONARD.,"Should come, 'twould needs be a glad day for him;"
780,LEONARD.,"He would himself, no doubt, be as happy then"
781,LEONARD.,As any that should meet him--
782,LEONARD.,
783,PRIEST.,PRIEST.
784,PRIEST.,"Happy, Sir--"
785,PRIEST.,
786,LEONARD.,LEONARD.
787,LEONARD.,
788,LEONARD.,"You said his kindred all were in their graves,"
789,LEONARD.,And that he had one Brother--
790,LEONARD.,
791,PRIEST.,PRIEST.
792,PRIEST.,That is but
793,PRIEST.,A fellow tale of sorrow.  From his youth
794,PRIEST.,"James, though not sickly, yet was delicate,"
795,PRIEST.,And Leonard being always by his side
796,PRIEST.,"Had done so many offices about him,"
797,PRIEST.,"That, though he was not of a timid nature,"
798,PRIEST.,Yet still the spirit of a mountain boy
799,PRIEST.,"In him was somewhat check'd, and when his Brother"
800,PRIEST.,Was gone to sea and he was left alone
801,PRIEST.,The little colour that he had was soon
802,PRIEST.,"Stolen from his cheek, he droop'd, and pin'd and pin'd;"
803,PRIEST.,
804,LEONARD.,LEONARD.
805,LEONARD.,
806,LEONARD.,But these are all the graves of full grown men!
807,LEONARD.,
808,PRIEST.,PRIEST.
809,PRIEST.,
810,PRIEST.,"Aye, Sir, that pass'd away: we took him to us."
811,PRIEST.,He was the child of all the dale--he liv'd
812,PRIEST.,"Three months with one, and six months with another:"
813,PRIEST.,"And wanted neither food, nor clothes, nor love,"
814,PRIEST.,"And many, many happy days were his."
815,PRIEST.,"But, whether blithe or sad, 'tis my belief"
816,PRIEST.,His absent Brother still was at his heart.
817,PRIEST.,"And, when he liv'd beneath our roof, we found"
818,PRIEST.,(A practice till this time unknown to him)
819,PRIEST.,"That often, rising from his bed at night,"
820,PRIEST.,"He in his sleep would walk about, and sleeping"
821,PRIEST.,He sought his Brother Leonard--You are mov'd!
822,PRIEST.,"Forgive me, Sir: before I spoke to you,"
823,PRIEST.,I judg'd you most unkindly.
824,PRIEST.,
825,LEONARD.,LEONARD.
826,LEONARD.,
827,LEONARD.,"But this youth,"
828,LEONARD.,How did he die at last?
829,LEONARD.,
830,PRIEST.,PRIEST.
831,PRIEST.,
832,PRIEST.,"One sweet May morning,"
833,PRIEST.,"It will be twelve years since, when Spring returns,"
834,PRIEST.,"He had gone forth among the new-dropp'd lambs,"
835,PRIEST.,With two or three companions whom it chanc'd
836,PRIEST.,Some further business summon'd to a house
837,PRIEST.,"Which stands at the Dale-head. James, tir'd perhaps,"
838,PRIEST.,Or from some other cause remain'd behind.
839,PRIEST.,You see yon precipice--it almost looks
840,PRIEST.,"Like some vast building made of many crags,"

842,PRIEST.,"That rises like a column from the vale,"

844,PRIEST.,"James, pointing to its summit, over which"
845,PRIEST.,"They all had purpos'd to return together,"
846,PRIEST.,Inform'd them that he there would wait for them:
847,PRIEST.,"They parted, and his comrades pass'd that way"
848,PRIEST.,"Some two hours after, but they did not find him"
849,PRIEST.,"At the appointed place, a circumstance"
850,PRIEST.,"Of which they took no heed: but one of them,"
851,PRIEST.,"Going by chance, at night, into the house"
852,PRIEST.,"Which at this time was James's home, there learn'd"
853,PRIEST.,That nobody had seen him all that day:
854,PRIEST.,"The morning came, and still, he was unheard of:"
855,PRIEST.,"The neighbours were alarm'd, and to the Brook"
856,PRIEST.,"Some went, and some towards the Lake; ere noon"
857,PRIEST.,They found him at the foot of that same Rock
858,PRIEST.,"Dead, and with mangled limbs. The third day after"
859,PRIEST.,"I buried him, poor Lad, and there he lies."

884,PRIEST.,"Yes, long before he died, he found that time"
885,PRIEST.,"Is a true friend to sorrow, and unless"
886,PRIEST.,"His thoughts were turn'd on Leonard's luckless fortune,"
887,PRIEST.,He talk'd about him with a chearful love.
888,PRIEST.,
889,LEONARD.,LEONARD.
890,LEONARD.,
891,LEONARD.,He could not come to an unhallow'd end!
892,LEONARD.,
893,PRIEST.,PRIEST.
894,PRIEST.,
895,PRIEST.,"Nay, God forbid! You recollect I mention'd"
896,PRIEST.,A habit which disquietude and grief
897,PRIEST.,"Had brought upon him, and we all conjectur'd"
898,PRIEST.,"That, as the day was warm, he had lain down"
899,PRIEST.,"Upon the grass, and, waiting for his comrades"
900,PRIEST.,"He there had fallen asleep, that in his sleep"
901,PRIEST.,He to the margin of the precipice
902,PRIEST.,"Had walk'd, and from the summit had fallen head-long,"
903,PRIEST.,"And so no doubt he perish'd: at the time,"
904,PRIEST.,"We guess, that in his hands he must have had"
905,PRIEST.,His Shepherd's staff; for midway in the cliff
906,PRIEST.,"It had been caught, and there for many years"
907,PRIEST.,It hung--and moulder'd there.
908,PRIEST.,
909,PRIEST.,The Priest here ended--
910,PRIEST.,"The Stranger would have thank'd him, but he felt"
911,PRIEST.,"Tears rushing in; both left the spot in silence,"
912,PRIEST.,"And Leonard, when they reach'd the church-yard gate,"
913,PRIEST.,"As the Priest lifted up the latch, turn'd round,"
914,PRIEST.,"And, looking at the grave, he said, ""My Brother."""
915,PRIEST.,"The Vicar did not hear the words: and now,"
916,PRIEST.,"Pointing towards the Cottage, he entreated"
917,PRIEST.,That Leonard would partake his homely fare:
918,PRIEST.,"The other thank'd him with a fervent voice,"
919,PRIEST.,"But added, that, the evening being calm,"
920,PRIEST.,He would pursue his journey. So they parted.
921,PRIEST.,
922,PRIEST.,It was not long ere Leonard reach'd a grove
923,PRIEST.,"That overhung the road: he there stopp'd short,"
924,PRIEST.,"And, sitting down beneath the trees, review'd"
925,PRIEST.,All that the Priest had said: his early years
926,PRIEST.,"Were with him in his heart: his cherish'd hopes,"
927,PRIEST.,And thoughts which had been his an hour before.
928,PRIEST.,"All press'd on him with such a weight, that now,"
929,PRIEST.,"This vale, where he had been so happy, seem'd"
930,PRIEST.,A place in which he could not bear to live:
931,PRIEST.,So he relinquish'd all his purposes.
932,PRIEST.,"He travell'd on to Egremont; and thence,"
933,PRIEST.,"That night, address'd a letter to the Priest"
934,PRIEST.,Reminding him of what had pass'd between them.
935,PRIEST.,"And adding, with a hope to be forgiven,"
936,PRIEST.,"That it was from the weakness of his heart,"
937,PRIEST.,"He had not dared to tell him, who he was."
938,PRIEST.,
939,PRIEST.,"This done, he went on shipboard, and is now"
940,PRIEST.,"A Seaman, a grey headed Mariner."

1340,LUCY GRAY.,
1341,LUCY GRAY.,The wretched Parents all that night

1354,LUCY GRAY.,The print of Lucy's feet.
1355,LUCY GRAY.,
1356,LUCY GRAY.,Then downward from the steep hill's edge

1358,LUCY GRAY.,"And through the broken hawthorn-hedge,"
1359,LUCY GRAY.,And by the long stone-wall;
1360,LUCY GRAY.,
1361,LUCY GRAY.,"And then an open field they cross'd,"

1746,ANDREW JONES.,ANDREW JONES.
1747,ANDREW JONES.,
1748,ANDREW JONES.,
1749,ANDREW JONES.,I hate that Andrew Jones: he'll breed
1750,ANDREW JONES.,His children up to waste and pillage.
1751,ANDREW JONES.,I wish the press-gang or the drum
1752,ANDREW JONES.,"With its tantara sound would come,"
1753,ANDREW JONES.,And sweep him from the village!
1754,ANDREW JONES.,
1755,ANDREW JONES.,"I said not this, because he loves"
1756,ANDREW JONES.,Through the long day to swear and tipple;
1757,ANDREW JONES.,But for the poor dear sake of one
1758,ANDREW JONES.,"To whom a foul deed he had done,"
1759,ANDREW JONES.,"A friendless Man, a travelling Cripple!"
1760,ANDREW JONES.,
1761,ANDREW JONES.,For this poor crawling helpless wretch
1762,ANDREW JONES.,"Some Horseman who was passing by,"
1763,ANDREW JONES.,A penny on the ground had thrown;
1764,ANDREW JONES.,But the poor Cripple was alone
1765,ANDREW JONES.,And could not stoop--no help was nigh.
1766,ANDREW JONES.,
1767,ANDREW JONES.,Inch-thick the dust lay on the ground
1768,ANDREW JONES.,For it had long been droughty weather:
1769,ANDREW JONES.,So with his staff the Cripple wrought
1770,ANDREW JONES.,Among the dust till he had brought
1771,ANDREW JONES.,The halfpennies together.
1772,ANDREW JONES.,
1773,ANDREW JONES.,It chanc'd that Andrew pass'd that way
1774,ANDREW JONES.,Just at the time; and there he found
1775,ANDREW JONES.,The Cripple in the mid-day heat
1776,ANDREW JONES.,"Standing alone, and at his feet"
1777,ANDREW JONES.,He saw the penny on the ground.
1778,ANDREW JONES.,
1779,ANDREW JONES.,He stopp'd and took the penny up.
1780,ANDREW JONES.,"And when the Cripple nearer drew,"
1781,ANDREW JONES.,"Quoth Andrew, ""Under half-a-crown."
1782,ANDREW JONES.,"What a man finds is all his own,"
1783,ANDREW JONES.,"And so, my Friend, good day to you."""
1784,ANDREW JONES.,
1785,ANDREW JONES.,"And _hence_ I said, that Andrew's boys"
1786,ANDREW JONES.,Will all be train'd to waste and pillage;
1787,ANDREW JONES.,"And wish'd the press-gang, or the drum"
1788,ANDREW JONES.,"With its tantara sound, would come"
1789,ANDREW JONES.,And sweep him from the village!
1790,ANDREW JONES.,
1791,ANDREW JONES.,
1792,ANDREW JONES.,
1793,ANDREW JONES.,
1794,ANDREW JONES.,"_The TWO THIEVES,"
1795,ANDREW JONES.,Or the last Stage of AVARICE_.
1796,ANDREW JONES.,
1797,ANDREW JONES.,
1798,ANDREW JONES.,Oh now that the genius of Bewick were mine
1799,ANDREW JONES.,And the skill which He learn'd on the Banks of the Tyne;
1800,ANDREW JONES.,When the Muses might deal with me just as they chose
1801,ANDREW JONES.,For I'd take my last leave both of verse and of prose.
1802,ANDREW JONES.,
1803,ANDREW JONES.,What feats would I work with my magical hand!
1804,ANDREW JONES.,Book-learning and books should be banish'd the land
1805,ANDREW JONES.,And for hunger and thirst and such troublesome calls
1806,ANDREW JONES.,Every ale-house should then have a feast on its walls.
1807,ANDREW JONES.,
1808,ANDREW JONES.,The Traveller would hang his wet clothes on a chair
1809,ANDREW JONES.,"Let them smoke, let them burn, not a straw would he care."
1810,ANDREW JONES.,"For the Prodigal Son, Joseph's Dream and his Sheaves,"
1811,ANDREW JONES.,Oh what would they be to my tale of two Thieves!
1812,ANDREW JONES.,
1813,ANDREW JONES.,"Little Dan is unbreech'd, he is three birth-days old,"
1814,ANDREW JONES.,"His Grandsire that age more than thirty times told,"
1815,ANDREW JONES.,There's ninety good seasons of fair and foul weather
1816,ANDREW JONES.,"Between them, and both go a stealing together."
1817,ANDREW JONES.,
1818,ANDREW JONES.,With chips is the Carpenter strewing his floor?
1819,ANDREW JONES.,It a cart-load of peats at an old Woman's door?
1820,ANDREW JONES.,"Old Daniel his hand to the treasure will slide,"
1821,ANDREW JONES.,And his Grandson's as busy at work by his side.
1822,ANDREW JONES.,
1823,ANDREW JONES.,"Old Daniel begins, he stops short and his eye"
1824,ANDREW JONES.,Through the lost look of dotage is cunning and sly.
1825,ANDREW JONES.,"'Tis a look which at this time is hardly his own,"
1826,ANDREW JONES.,But tells a plain tale of the days that are flown.
1827,ANDREW JONES.,
1828,ANDREW JONES.,Dan once had a heart which was mov'd by the wires
1829,ANDREW JONES.,Of manifold pleasures and many desires:
1830,ANDREW JONES.,And what if he cherish'd his purse? 'Twas no more
1831,ANDREW JONES.,Than treading a path trod by thousands before.
1832,ANDREW JONES.,
1833,ANDREW JONES.,"'Twas a path trod by thousands, but Daniel is one"
1834,ANDREW JONES.,Who went something farther than others have gone;
1835,ANDREW JONES.,And now with old Daniel you see how it fares
1836,ANDREW JONES.,You see to what end he has brought his grey hairs.
1837,ANDREW JONES.,
1838,ANDREW JONES.,The pair sally forth hand in hand; ere the sun
1839,ANDREW JONES.,Has peer'd o'er the beeches their work is begun:
1840,ANDREW JONES.,"And yet into whatever sin they may fall,"
1841,ANDREW JONES.,This Child but half knows it and that not at all.
1842,ANDREW JONES.,
1843,ANDREW JONES.,"They hunt through the street with deliberate tread,"
1844,ANDREW JONES.,And each in his turn is both leader and led;
1845,ANDREW JONES.,"And wherever they carry their plots and their wiles,"
1846,ANDREW JONES.,Every face in the village is dimpled with smiles.
1847,ANDREW JONES.,
1848,ANDREW JONES.,"Neither check'd by the rich nor the needy they roam,"
1849,ANDREW JONES.,For grey-headed Dan has a daughter at home;
1850,ANDREW JONES.,"Who will gladly repair all the damage that's done,"
1851,ANDREW JONES.,"And three, were it ask'd, would be render'd for one."
1852,ANDREW JONES.,
1853,ANDREW JONES.,"Old Man! whom so oft I with pity have ey'd,"
1854,ANDREW JONES.,I love thee and love the sweet boy at thy side:
1855,ANDREW JONES.,"Long yet may'st thou live, for a teacher we see"
1856,ANDREW JONES.,That lifts up the veil of our nature in thee.
1857,ANDREW JONES.,
1858,ANDREW JONES.,A whirl-blast from behind the hill
1859,ANDREW JONES.,Rush'd o'er the wood with startling sound:
1860,ANDREW JONES.,"Then all at once the air was still,"
1861,ANDREW JONES.,And showers of hail-stones patter'd round.
1862,ANDREW JONES.,
1863,ANDREW JONES.,"Where leafless Oaks tower'd high above,"
1864,ANDREW JONES.,I sate within an undergrove
1865,ANDREW JONES.,"Of tallest hollies, tall and green,"
1866,ANDREW JONES.,A fairer bower was never seen.
1867,ANDREW JONES.,
1868,ANDREW JONES.,From year to year the spacious floor
1869,ANDREW JONES.,"With wither'd leaves is cover'd o'er,"
1870,ANDREW JONES.,You could not lay a hair between:
1871,ANDREW JONES.,And all the year the bower is green.
1872,ANDREW JONES.,
1873,ANDREW JONES.,But see! where'er the hailstones drop
1874,ANDREW JONES.,"The wither'd leaves all skip and hop,"
1875,ANDREW JONES.,There's not a breeze--no breath of air--
1876,ANDREW JONES.,"Yet here, and there, and every where"
1877,ANDREW JONES.,
1878,ANDREW JONES.,"Along the floor, beneath the shade"
1879,ANDREW JONES.,"By those embowering hollies made,"
1880,ANDREW JONES.,"The leaves in myriads jump and spring,"
1881,ANDREW JONES.,As if with pipes and music rare
1882,ANDREW JONES.,"Some Robin Good-fellow were there,"
1883,ANDREW JONES.,"And all those leaves, that jump and spring,"
1884,ANDREW JONES.,"Were each a joyous, living thing."
1885,ANDREW JONES.,
1886,ANDREW JONES.,Oh! grant me Heaven a heart at ease
1887,ANDREW JONES.,"That I may never cease to find,"
1888,ANDREW JONES.,Even in appearances like these
1889,ANDREW JONES.,Enough to nourish and to stir my mind!

1940,RUTH.,Her Father took another Mate;
1941,RUTH.,"And so, not seven years old,"
1942,RUTH.,The slighted Child at her own will
1943,RUTH.,Went wandering over dale and hill
1944,RUTH.,In thoughtless freedom bold.
1945,RUTH.,
1946,RUTH.,And she had made a pipe of straw
1947,RUTH.,And from that oaten pipe could draw
1948,RUTH.,All sounds of winds and floods;
1949,RUTH.,"Had built a bower upon the green,"
1950,RUTH.,As if she from her birth had been
1951,RUTH.,An Infant of the woods.
1952,RUTH.,
1953,RUTH.,"There came a Youth from Georgia's shore,"
1954,RUTH.,A military Casque he wore
1955,RUTH.,With splendid feathers drest;
1956,RUTH.,He brought them from the Cherokees;
1957,RUTH.,The feathers nodded in the breeze
1958,RUTH.,And made a gallant crest.
1959,RUTH.,
1960,RUTH.,From Indian blood you deem him sprung:
1961,RUTH.,Ah no! he spake the English tongue
1962,RUTH.,And bare a Soldier's name;
1963,RUTH.,And when America was free
1964,RUTH.,From battle and from jeopardy
1965,RUTH.,He cross the ocean came.
1966,RUTH.,
1967,RUTH.,With hues of genius on his cheek
1968,RUTH.,In finest tones the Youth could speak.
1969,RUTH.,--While he was yet a Boy
1970,RUTH.,"The moon, the glory of the sun,"
1971,RUTH.,And streams that murmur as they run
1972,RUTH.,Had been his dearest joy.
1973,RUTH.,
1974,RUTH.,He was a lovely Youth! I guess
1975,RUTH.,The panther in the wilderness
1976,RUTH.,Was not so fair as he;
1977,RUTH.,"And when he chose to sport and play,"
1978,RUTH.,No dolphin ever was so gay
1979,RUTH.,Upon the tropic sea.
1980,RUTH.,
1981,RUTH.,"Among the Indians he had fought,"
1982,RUTH.,And with him many tales he brought
1983,RUTH.,"Of pleasure and of fear,"
1984,RUTH.,Such tales as told to any Maid
1985,RUTH.,By such a Youth in the green shade
1986,RUTH.,Were perilous to hear.
1987,RUTH.,
1988,RUTH.,"He told of Girls, a happy rout,"
1989,RUTH.,Who quit their fold with dance and shout
1990,RUTH.,Their pleasant Indian Town
1991,RUTH.,"To gather strawberries all day long,"
1992,RUTH.,Returning with a choral song
1993,RUTH.,When day-light is gone down.
1994,RUTH.,
1995,RUTH.,He spake of plants divine and strange
1996,RUTH.,"That ev'ry day their blossoms change,"
1997,RUTH.,Ten thousand lovely hues!
1998,RUTH.,"With budding, fading, faded flowers"
1999,RUTH.,They stand the wonder of the bowers
2000,RUTH.,From morn to evening dews.
2001,RUTH.,
2002,RUTH.,"He told of the Magnolia, [6] spread"
2003,RUTH.,"High as a cloud, high over head!"
2004,RUTH.,"The Cypress and her spire,"
2005,RUTH.,Of flowers that with one scarlet gleam [7]
2006,RUTH.,Cover a hundred leagues and seem
2007,RUTH.,To set the hills on fire.

2016,RUTH.,
2017,RUTH.,"The Youth of green Savannahs spake,"
2018,RUTH.,And many an endless endless lake
2019,RUTH.,With all its fairy crowds
2020,RUTH.,Of islands that together lie
2021,RUTH.,As quietly as spots of sky
2022,RUTH.,Among the evening clouds:
2023,RUTH.,
2024,RUTH.,"And then he said ""How sweet it were"
2025,RUTH.,"A fisher or a hunter there,"
2026,RUTH.,"A gardener in the shade,"
2027,RUTH.,Still wandering with an easy mind
2028,RUTH.,To build a household fire and find
2029,RUTH.,"A home in every glade."""
2030,RUTH.,
2031,RUTH.,"""What days and what sweet years! Ah me!"
2032,RUTH.,"Our life were life indeed, with thee"
2033,RUTH.,"So pass'd in quiet bliss,"
2034,RUTH.,"And all the while"" said he ""to know"
2035,RUTH.,That we were in a world of woe.
2036,RUTH.,"On such an earth as this!"""
2037,RUTH.,
2038,RUTH.,And then he sometimes interwove
2039,RUTH.,"Dear thoughts about a Father's love,"
2040,RUTH.,"""For there,"" said he, ""are spun"
2041,RUTH.,Around the heart such tender ties
2042,RUTH.,That our own children to our eyes
2043,RUTH.,"Are dearer than the sun."""
2044,RUTH.,
2045,RUTH.,Sweet Ruth! and could you go with me
2046,RUTH.,"My helpmate in the woods to be,"
2047,RUTH.,Our shed at night to rear;
2048,RUTH.,"Or run, my own adopted bride,"
2049,RUTH.,A sylvan huntress at my side
2050,RUTH.,And drive the flying deer.
2051,RUTH.,
2052,RUTH.,"""Beloved Ruth!"" No more he said"
2053,RUTH.,Sweet Ruth alone at midnight shed
2054,RUTH.,"A solitary tear,"
2055,RUTH.,She thought again--and did agree
2056,RUTH.,"With him to sail across the sea,"
2057,RUTH.,And drive the flying deer.
2058,RUTH.,
2059,RUTH.,"""And now, as fitting is and right,"
2060,RUTH.,"We in the Church our faith will plight,"
2061,RUTH.,"A Husband and a Wife."""
2062,RUTH.,Even so they did; and I may say
2063,RUTH.,That to sweet Ruth that happy day
2064,RUTH.,Was more than human life.
2065,RUTH.,
2066,RUTH.,"Through dream and vision did she sink,"
2067,RUTH.,Delighted all the while to think
2068,RUTH.,That on those lonesome floods
2069,RUTH.,And green Savannahs she should share
2070,RUTH.,"His board with lawful joy, and bear"
2071,RUTH.,His name in the wild woods.
2072,RUTH.,
2073,RUTH.,"But, as you have before been told,"
2074,RUTH.,"This Stripling, sportive gay and bold,"
2075,RUTH.,"And, with his dancing crest,"
2076,RUTH.,"So beautiful, through savage lands"
2077,RUTH.,Had roam'd about with vagrant bands
2078,RUTH.,Of Indians in the West.
2079,RUTH.,
2080,RUTH.,"The wind, the tempest roaring high,"
2081,RUTH.,The tumult of a tropic sky
2082,RUTH.,Might well be dangerous food.
2083,RUTH.,"For him, a Youth to whom was given"
2084,RUTH.,"So much of earth so much of Heaven,"
2085,RUTH.,And such impetuous blood.
2086,RUTH.,
2087,RUTH.,Whatever in those climes he found
2088,RUTH.,Irregular in sight or sound
2089,RUTH.,Did to his mind impart
2090,RUTH.,"A kindred impulse, seem'd allied"
2091,RUTH.,"To his own powers, and justified"
2092,RUTH.,The workings of his heart.
2093,RUTH.,
2094,RUTH.,Nor less to feed voluptuous thought
2095,RUTH.,"The beauteous forms of Nature wrought,"
2096,RUTH.,Fair trees and lovely flowers;
2097,RUTH.,"The breezes their own languor lent,"
2098,RUTH.,The stars had feelings which they sent
2099,RUTH.,Into those magic bowers.
2100,RUTH.,
2101,RUTH.,"Yet, in his worst pursuits, I ween,"
2102,RUTH.,That sometimes there did intervene
2103,RUTH.,Pure hopes of high intent:
2104,RUTH.,For passions link'd to forms so fair
2105,RUTH.,"And stately, needs must have their share"
2106,RUTH.,Of noble sentiment.
2107,RUTH.,
2108,RUTH.,"But ill he liv'd, much evil saw"
2109,RUTH.,With men to whom no better law
2110,RUTH.,Nor better life was known;
2111,RUTH.,Deliberately and undeceiv'd
2112,RUTH.,"Those wild men's vices he receiv'd,"
2113,RUTH.,And gave them back his own.
2114,RUTH.,
2115,RUTH.,His genius and his moral frame
2116,RUTH.,"Were thus impair'd, and he became"
2117,RUTH.,The slave of low desires;
2118,RUTH.,A man who without self-controul
2119,RUTH.,Would seek what the degraded soul
2120,RUTH.,Unworthily admires.
2121,RUTH.,
2122,RUTH.,And yet he with no feign'd delight
2123,RUTH.,"Had woo'd the Maiden, day and night"
2124,RUTH.,"Had luv'd her, night and morn;"
2125,RUTH.,What could he less than love a Maid
2126,RUTH.,Whose heart with so much nature play'd
2127,RUTH.,So kind and so forlorn?
2128,RUTH.,
2129,RUTH.,"But now the pleasant dream was gone,"
2130,RUTH.,"No hope, no wish remain'd, not one,"
2131,RUTH.,"They stirr'd him now no more,"
2132,RUTH.,"New objects did new pleasure give,"
2133,RUTH.,And once again he wish'd to live
2134,RUTH.,As lawless as before.
2135,RUTH.,
2136,RUTH.,Meanwhile as thus with him it fared.
2137,RUTH.,They for the voyage were prepared
2138,RUTH.,"And went to the sea-shore,"
2139,RUTH.,"But, when they thither came, the Youth"
2140,RUTH.,"Deserted his poor Bride, and Ruth"
2141,RUTH.,Could never find him more.
2142,RUTH.,
2143,RUTH.,"""God help thee Ruth!""--Such pains she had"
2144,RUTH.,That she in half a year was mad
2145,RUTH.,"And in a prison hous'd,"
2146,RUTH.,"And there, exulting in her wrongs,"
2147,RUTH.,Among the music of her songs
2148,RUTH.,She fearfully carouz'd.
2149,RUTH.,
2150,RUTH.,"Yet sometimes milder hours she knew,"
2151,RUTH.,"Nor wanted sun, nor rain, nor dew,"
2152,RUTH.,"Nor pastimes of the May,"
2153,RUTH.,"They all were with her in her cell,"
2154,RUTH.,And a wild brook with chearful knell
2155,RUTH.,Did o'er the pebbles play.
2156,RUTH.,
2157,RUTH.,When Ruth three seasons thus had lain
2158,RUTH.,"There came a respite to her pain,"
2159,RUTH.,She from her prison fled;
2160,RUTH.,"But of the Vagrant none took thought,"
2161,RUTH.,And where it liked her best she sought
2162,RUTH.,Her shelter and her bread.
2163,RUTH.,
2164,RUTH.,Among the fields she breath'd again:
2165,RUTH.,The master-current of her brain
2166,RUTH.,"Ran permanent and free,"
2167,RUTH.,And to the pleasant Banks of Tone [8]
2168,RUTH.,"She took her way, to dwell alone"
2169,RUTH.,Under the greenwood tree.
2170,RUTH.,
2171,RUTH.,"The engines of her grief, the tools"
2172,RUTH.,"That shap'd her sorrow, rocks and pools,"
2173,RUTH.,And airs that gently stir
2174,RUTH.,"The vernal leaves, she loved them still,"
2175,RUTH.,Nor ever tax'd them with the ill
2176,RUTH.,Which had been done to her.
2177,RUTH.,
2178,RUTH.,[Footnote 8: The Tone is a River of Somersetshire at no great
2179,RUTH.,"distance from the Quantock Hills. These Hills, which are alluded to"
2180,RUTH.,"a few Stanzas below, are extremely beautiful, and in most places"
2181,RUTH.,richly covered with Coppice woods.]
2182,RUTH.,
2183,RUTH.,"A Barn her _winter_ bed supplies,"
2184,RUTH.,But till the warmth of summer skies
2185,RUTH.,"And summer days is gone,"
2186,RUTH.,(And in this tale we all agree)
2187,RUTH.,"She sleeps beneath the greenwood tree,"
2188,RUTH.,And other home hath none.
2189,RUTH.,
2190,RUTH.,If she is press'd by want of food
2191,RUTH.,She from her dwelling in the wood
2192,RUTH.,"Repairs to a road side,"
2193,RUTH.,"And there she begs at one steep place,"
2194,RUTH.,Where up and down with easy pace
2195,RUTH.,The horsemen-travellers ride.
2196,RUTH.,
2197,RUTH.,That oaten pipe of hers is mute
2198,RUTH.,"Or thrown away, but with a flute"

2225,_LINES,
2226,_LINES,
2227,_LINES,Stranger! this hillock of mishapen stones
2228,_LINES,"Is not a ruin of the ancient time,"
2229,_LINES,"Nor, as perchance thou rashly deem'st, the Cairn"
2230,_LINES,Of some old British Chief: 'tis nothing more
2231,_LINES,Than the rude embryo of a little dome
2232,_LINES,"Or pleasure-house, which was to have been built"
2233,_LINES,Among the birch-trees of this rocky isle.
2234,_LINES,"But, as it chanc'd, Sir William having learn'd"
2235,_LINES,"That from the shore a full-grown man might wade,"
2236,_LINES,And make himself a freeman of this spot
2237,_LINES,"At any hour he chose, the Knight forthwith"
2238,_LINES,"Desisted, and the quarry and the mound"
2239,_LINES,Are monuments of his unfinish'd task.--
2240,_LINES,"The block on which these lines are trac'd, perhaps,"
2241,_LINES,Was once selected as the corner-stone
2242,_LINES,"Of the intended pile, which would have been"
2243,_LINES,"Some quaint odd play-thing of elaborate skill,"
2244,_LINES,"So that, I guess, the linnet and the thrush,"
2245,_LINES,"And other little builders who dwell here,"
2246,_LINES,"Had wonder'd at the work. But blame him not,"
2247,_LINES,For old Sir William was a gentle Knight
2248,_LINES,Bred in this vale to which he appertain'd
2249,_LINES,With all his ancestry. Then peace to him
2250,_LINES,And for the outrage which he had devis'd
2251,_LINES,Entire forgiveness.--But if thou art one
2252,_LINES,On fire with thy impatience to become
2253,_LINES,"An Inmate of these mountains, if disturb'd"

2297,_LINES,
2298,_LINES,The sighs which Matthew heav'd were sighs
2299,_LINES,Of one tir'd out with fun and madness;
2300,_LINES,The tears which came to Matthew's eyes

2303,_LINES,Yet sometimes when the secret cup
2304,_LINES,Of still and serious thought went round

2328,_LINES,
2329,_LINES,"And on that morning, through the grass,"
2330,_LINES,"And by the steaming rills,"
2331,_LINES,We travell'd merrily to pass
2332,_LINES,A day among the hills.
2333,_LINES,
2334,_LINES,"""Our work,"" said I, ""was well begun;"

2338,_LINES,
2339,_LINES,"A second time did Matthew stop,"
2340,_LINES,And fixing still his eye
2341,_LINES,Upon the eastern mountain-top
2342,_LINES,To me he made reply.
2343,_LINES,
2344,_LINES,Yon cloud with that long purple cleft
2345,_LINES,Brings fresh into my mind
2346,_LINES,A day like this which I have left
2347,_LINES,Full thirty years behind.
2348,_LINES,
2349,_LINES,And on that slope of springing corn
2350,_LINES,The self-same crimson hue
2351,_LINES,"Fell from the sky that April morn,"
2352,_LINES,The same which now I view!
2353,_LINES,
2354,_LINES,With rod and line my silent sport

2356,_LINES,"And, coming to the church, stopp'd short"
2357,_LINES,Beside my Daughter's grave.
2358,_LINES,
2359,_LINES,Nine summers had she scarcely seen
2360,_LINES,The pride of all the vale;

2363,_LINES,
2364,_LINES,"Six feet in earth my Emma lay,"

2368,_LINES,
2369,_LINES,"And, turning from her grave, I met"

2384,_LINES,"A pair of Friends, though I was young,"
2385,_LINES,And Matthew seventy-two.
2386,_LINES,
2387,_LINES,"We lay beneath a spreading oak,"
2388,_LINES,"Beside a mossy seat,"
2389,_LINES,"And from the turf a fountain broke,"
2390,_LINES,And gurgled at our feet.
2391,_LINES,
2392,_LINES,"Now, Matthew, let us try to match"
2393,_LINES,This water's pleasant tune
2394,_LINES,"With some old Border-song, or catch"

2396,_LINES,
2397,_LINES,Or of the Church-clock and the chimes
2398,_LINES,"Sing here beneath the shade,"
2399,_LINES,That half-mad thing of witty rhymes
2400,_LINES,Which you last April made!
2401,_LINES,

2406,_LINES,
2407,_LINES,"""Down to the vale this water steers,"

2410,_LINES,"And flow as now it flows."""
2411,_LINES,
2412,_LINES,"And here, on this delightful day,"
2413,_LINES,I cannot chuse but think
2414,_LINES,"How oft, a vigorous Man, I lay"
2415,_LINES,Beside this Fountain's brink.
2416,_LINES,
2417,_LINES,My eyes are dim with childish tears.
2418,_LINES,"My heart is idly stirr'd,"
2419,_LINES,"For the same sound is in my ears,"
2420,_LINES,Which in those days I heard.
2421,_LINES,
2422,_LINES,Thus fares it still in our decay:
2423,_LINES,And yet the wiser mind
2424,_LINES,Mourns less for what age takes away
2425,_LINES,Than what it leaves behind.

2431,_LINES,
2432,_LINES,With Nature never do _they_ wage
2433,_LINES,A foolish strife; they see
2434,_LINES,"A happy youth, and their old age"
2435,_LINES,Is beautiful and free:
2436,_LINES,
2437,_LINES,"But we are press'd by heavy laws,"

2441,_LINES,
2442,_LINES,If there is one who need bemoan
2443,_LINES,"His kindred laid in earth,"
2444,_LINES,"The houshold hearts that were his own,"
2445,_LINES,It is the man of mirth.
2446,_LINES,
2447,_LINES,"""My days, my Friend, are almost gone,"
2448,_LINES,"My life has been approv'd,"
2449,_LINES,"And many love me, but by none"
2450,_LINES,"Am I enough belov'd."""
2451,_LINES,
2452,_LINES,"""Now both himself and me he wrongs,"
2453,_LINES,The man who thus complains!
2454,_LINES,I live and sing my idle songs

2513,NUTTING.,"And fade, unseen by any human eye,"
2514,NUTTING.,Where fairy water-breaks do murmur on
2515,NUTTING.,"For ever, and I saw the sparkling foam,"

2527,NUTTING.,"Of hazels, and the green and mossy bower"
2528,NUTTING.,"Deform'd and sullied, patiently gave up"
2529,NUTTING.,Their quiet being: and unless I now
2530,NUTTING.,"Confound my present feelings with the past,"
2531,NUTTING.,"Even then, when, from the bower I turn'd away,"
2532,NUTTING.,"Exulting, rich beyond the wealth of kings"

2602,NUTTING.,
2603,NUTTING.,"No other sheep were near, the Lamb was all alone,"
2604,NUTTING.,And by a slender cord was tether'd to a stone;
2605,NUTTING.,"With one knee on the grass did the little Maiden kneel,"

2607,NUTTING.,
2608,NUTTING.,The Lamb while from her hand he thus his supper took

2617,NUTTING.,
2618,NUTTING.,"Towards the Lamb she look'd, and from that shady place"
2619,NUTTING.,I unobserv'd could see the workings of her face:
2620,NUTTING.,If Nature to her tongue could measur'd numbers bring
2621,NUTTING.,"Thus, thought I, to her Lamb that little Maid would sing."

2623,NUTTING.,"What ails thee, Young One? What? Why pull so at thy cord?"

2629,NUTTING.,Thy limbs are they not strong? And beautiful thou art:
2630,NUTTING.,"This grass is tender grass, these flowers they have no peer,"
2631,NUTTING.,And that green corn all day is rustling in thy ears.

2633,NUTTING.,"If the Sun is shining hot, do but stretch thy woollen chain,"

2643,NUTTING.,"He took thee in his arms, and in pity brought thee home,"

2653,NUTTING.,"Thy limbs will shortly be twice as stout as they are now,"

3303,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Between them and their object: yet, meanwhile,"

3352,II.,Amid the smoke of cities did you pass
3353,II.,"Your time of early youth, and there you learn'd,"
3354,II.,"From years of quiet industry, to love"
3355,II.,"The living Beings by your own fire-side,"
3356,II.,"With such a strong devotion, that your heart"
3357,II.,Is slow towards the sympathies of them
3358,II.,"Who look upon the hills with tenderness,"
3359,II.,And make dear friendships with the streams and groves.
3360,II.,"Yet we who are transgressors in this kind,"
3361,II.,Dwelling retired in our simplicity
3362,II.,"Among the woods and fields, we love you well,"
3363,II.,"Joanna! and I guess, since you have been"
3364,II.,"So distant from us now for two long years,"
3365,II.,That you will gladly listen to discourse
3366,II.,"However trivial, if you thence are taught"
3367,II.,"That they, with whom you once were happy, talk"
3368,II.,Familiarly of you and of old times.

3370,II.,"While I was seated, now some ten days past,"
3371,II.,"Beneath those lofty firs, that overtop"
3372,II.,"Their ancient neighbour, the old Steeple tower,"
3373,II.,The Vicar from his gloomy house hard by

3375,II.,"""How fares Joanna, that wild-hearted Maid!"
3376,II.,"And when will she return to us?"" he paus'd,"

3379,II.,"Reviving obsolete Idolatry,"
3380,II.,"I like a Runic Priest, in characters"

3384,II.,"--Now, by those dear immunities of heart"
3385,II.,"Engender'd betwixt malice and true love,"
3386,II.,"I was not both to be so catechiz'd,"
3387,II.,"And this was my reply.--""As it befel,"
3388,II.,One summer morning we had walk'd abroad
3389,II.,"At break of day, Joanna and myself."
3390,II.,"--'Twas that delightful season, when the broom,"
3391,II.,"Full flower'd, and visible on every steep,"
3392,II.,"Along the copses runs in veins of gold."""
3393,II.,
3394,II.,"Our pathway led us on to Rotha's banks,"
3395,II.,And when we came in front of that tall rock
3396,II.,"Which looks towards the East, I there stopp'd short,"
3397,II.,And trac'd the lofty barrier with my eye
3398,II.,From base to summit; such delight I found
3399,II.,"To note in shrub and tree, in stone and flower,"
3400,II.,"That intermixture of delicious hues,"
3401,II.,"Along so vast a surface, all at once,"
3402,II.,"In one impression, by connecting force"
3403,II.,"Of their own beauty, imag'd in the heart."
3404,II.,
3405,II.,"--When I had gaz'd perhaps two minutes' space,"
3406,II.,"Joanna, looking in my eyes, beheld"
3407,II.,"That ravishment of mine, and laugh'd aloud."
3408,II.,"The rock, like something starting from a sleep,"
3409,II.,"Took up the Lady's voice, and laugh'd again:"
3410,II.,That ancient Woman seated on Helm-crag
3411,II.,"Was ready with her cavern; Hammar-Scar,"
3412,II.,And the tall Steep of Silver-How sent forth
3413,II.,"A noise of laughter; southern Loughrigg heard,"
3414,II.,And Fairfield answer'd with a mountain tone:
3415,II.,Helvellyn far into the clear blue sky
3416,II.,"Carried the Lady's voice,--old Skiddaw blew"
3417,II.,His speaking trumpet;--back out of the clouds
3418,II.,Of Glaramara southward came the voice;
3419,II.,And Kirkstone toss'd it from his misty head.
3420,II.,"Now whether, (said I to our cordial Friend"
3421,II.,Who in the hey-day of astonishment
3422,II.,Smil'd in my face) this were in simple truth
3423,II.,A work accomplish'd by the brotherhood
3424,II.,"Of ancient mountains, or my ear was touch'd"
3425,II.,"With dreams and visionary impulses,"
3426,II.,Is not for me to tell; but sure I am
3427,II.,That there was a loud uproar in the hills.
3428,II.,"And, while we both were listening, to my side"
3429,II.,"The fair Joanna drew, is if she wish'd"
3430,II.,To shelter from some object of her fear.
3431,II.,
3432,II.,"--And hence, long afterwards, when eighteen moons"
3433,II.,"Were wasted, as I chanc'd to walk alone"
3434,II.,"Beneath this rock, at sun-rise, on a calm"
3435,II.,"And silent morning, I sate down, and there,"
3436,II.,"In memory of affections old and true,"
3437,II.,I chissel'd out in those rude characters
3438,II.,Joanna's name upon the living stone.
3439,II.,"And I, and all who dwell by my fire-side"
3440,II.,"Have call'd the lovely rock, Joanna's Rock."

3490,IV.,Between the water and a winding slope
3491,IV.,"Of copse and thicket, leaves the eastern shore"
3492,IV.,Of Grasmere safe in its own privacy.
3493,IV.,"And there, myself and two beloved Friends,"
3494,IV.,"One calm September morning, ere the mist"
3495,IV.,"Had altogether yielded to the sun,"
3496,IV.,Saunter'd on this retir'd and difficult way.
3497,IV.,"--Ill suits the road with one in haste, but we"
3498,IV.,"Play'd with our time; and, as we stroll'd along,"
3499,IV.,
3500,IV.,It was our occupation to observe
3501,IV.,"Such objects as the waves had toss'd ashore,"
3502,IV.,"Feather, or leaf, or weed, or wither'd bough,"
3503,IV.,Each on the other heap'd along the line
3504,IV.,"Of the dry wreck. And in our vacant mood,"
3505,IV.,Not seldom did we stop to watch some tuft
3506,IV.,"Of dandelion seed or thistle's beard,"
3507,IV.,"Which, seeming lifeless half, and half impell'd"
3508,IV.,"By some internal feeling, skimm'd along"
3509,IV.,Close to the surface of the lake that lay
3510,IV.,"Asleep in a dead calm, ran closely on"
3511,IV.,"Along the dead calm lake, now here, now there,"
3512,IV.,In all its sportive wanderings all the while
3513,IV.,Making report of an invisible breeze
3514,IV.,"That was its wings, its chariot, and its horse,"
3515,IV.,"Its very playmate, and its moving soul."
3516,IV.,
3517,IV.,"--And often, trifling with a privilege"
3518,IV.,"Alike indulg'd to all, we paus'd, one now,"
3519,IV.,"And now the other, to point out, perchance"
3520,IV.,"To pluck, some flower or water-weed, too fair"
3521,IV.,Either to be divided from the place
3522,IV.,"On which it grew, or to be left alone"
3523,IV.,"To its own beauty. Many such there are,"
3524,IV.,"Fair ferns and flowers, and chiefly that tall plant"
3525,IV.,"So stately, of the Queen Osmunda nam'd,"
3526,IV.,Plant lovelier in its own retir'd abode
3527,IV.,"On Grasmere's beach, than Naid by the side"
3528,IV.,"Of Grecian brook, or Lady of the Mere"
3529,IV.,Sole-sitting by the shores of old Romance.
3530,IV.,--So fared we that sweet morning: from the fields
3531,IV.,"Meanwhile, a noise was heard, the busy mirth"
3532,IV.,"Of Reapers, Men and Women, Boys and Girls."
3533,IV.,
3534,IV.,"Delighted much to listen to those sounds,"
3535,IV.,"And in the fashion which I have describ'd,"
3536,IV.,"Feeding unthinking fancies, we advanc'd"
3537,IV.,"Along the indented shore; when suddenly,"
3538,IV.,"Through a thin veil of glittering haze, we saw"
3539,IV.,Before us on a point of jutting land
3540,IV.,The tall and upright figure of a Man
3541,IV.,"Attir'd in peasant's garb, who stood alone"
3542,IV.,Angling beside the margin of the lake.
3543,IV.,"That way we turn'd our steps: nor was it long,"
3544,IV.,Ere making ready comments on the sight
3545,IV.,"Which then we saw, with one and the same voice"
3546,IV.,"We all cried out, that he must be indeed"
3547,IV.,"An idle man, who thus could lose a day"
3548,IV.,"Of the mid harvest, when the labourer's hire"
3549,IV.,"Is ample, and some little might be stor'd"
3550,IV.,Wherewith to chear him in the winter time.
3551,IV.,
3552,IV.,Thus talking of that Peasant we approach'd
3553,IV.,Close to the spot where with his rod and line
3554,IV.,He stood alone; whereat he turn'd his head
3555,IV.,To greet us--and we saw a man worn down
3556,IV.,"By sickness, gaunt and lean, with sunken cheeks"
3557,IV.,"And wasted limbs, his legs so long and lean"
3558,IV.,"That for my single self I look'd at them,"
3559,IV.,Forgetful of the body they sustain'd.--
3560,IV.,"Too weak to labour in the harvest field,"
3561,IV.,The man was using his best skill to gain
3562,IV.,A pittance from the dead unfeeling lake
3563,IV.,That knew not of his wants. I will not say
3564,IV.,"What thoughts immediately were ours, nor how"
3565,IV.,"The happy idleness of that sweet morn,"
3566,IV.,"With all its lovely images, was chang'd"
3567,IV.,To serious musing and to self-reproach.
3568,IV.,
3569,IV.,Nor did we fail to see within ourselves
3570,IV.,"What need there is to be reserv'd in speech,"
3571,IV.,And temper all our thoughts with charity.
3572,IV.,"--Therefore, unwilling to forget that day,"
3573,IV.,"My Friend, Myself, and She who then receiv'd"
3574,IV.,"The same admonishment, have call'd the plate"
3575,IV.,"By a memorial name, uncouth indeed"
3576,IV.,As e'er by Mariner was giv'n to Bay
3577,IV.,"Or Foreland on a new-discover'd coast,"

3590,V.,"There was no road, nor any wood-man's path,"
3591,V.,"But the thick umbrage, checking the wild growth"
3592,V.,"Of weed sapling, on the soft green turf"
3593,V.,Beneath the branches of itself had made
3594,V.,"A track which brought us to a slip of lawn,"
3595,V.,And a small bed of water in the woods.
3596,V.,
3597,V.,All round this pool both flocks and herds might drink
3598,V.,"On its firm margin, even as from a well"

3600,V.,"Had shap'd for their refreshment, nor did sun"
3601,V.,Or wind from any quarter ever come
3602,V.,"But as a blessing to this calm recess,"
3603,V.,This glade of water and this one green field.
3604,V.,The spot was made by Nature for herself:
3605,V.,"The travellers know it not, and 'twill remain"

3677,_A PASTORAL POEM_,His bodily frame had been from youth to age
3678,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Of an unusual strength: his mind was keen
3679,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Intense and frugal, apt for all affairs,"

3716,_A PASTORAL POEM_,The pleasure which there is in life itself.
3717,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
3718,_A PASTORAL POEM_,He had not passed his days in singleness.
3719,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"He had a Wife, a comely Matron, old"
3720,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Though younger than himself full twenty years.
3721,_A PASTORAL POEM_,She was a woman of a stirring life
3722,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Whose heart was in her house: two wheels she had
3723,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Of antique form, this large for spinning wool,"
3724,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"That small for flax, and if one wheel had rest,"
3725,_A PASTORAL POEM_,It was because the other was at work.
3726,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"The Pair had but one Inmate in their house,"

3730,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"With one foot in the grave. This only son,"
3731,_A PASTORAL POEM_,With two brave sheep dogs tried in many a storm.
3732,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
3733,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"The one of an inestimable worth,"
3734,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Made all their Household. I may truly say,"
3735,_A PASTORAL POEM_,That they were as a proverb in the vale
3736,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"For endless industry. When day was gone,"
3737,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And from their occupations out of doors
3738,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"The Son and Father were come home, even then,"
3739,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Their labour did not cease, unless when all"
3740,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Turn'd to their cleanly supper-board, and there"

3742,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Sate round their basket pil'd with oaten cakes,"
3743,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And their plain home-made cheese. Yet when their meal

3806,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Exceeding was the love he bare to him,"

3810,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"For dalliance and delight, as is the use"
3811,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Of Fathers, but with patient mind enforc'd"

3814,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
3815,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And in a later time, ere yet the Boy"

3820,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"With sheep before him on his Shepherd's stool,"
3821,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Beneath that large old Oak, which near their door"
3822,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Stood, and from it's enormous breadth of shade"
3823,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Chosen for the Shearer's covert from the sun,"
3824,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Thence in our rustic dialect was call'd

3845,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And gave it to the Boy; wherewith equipp'd
3846,_A PASTORAL POEM_,He as a Watchman oftentimes was plac'd
3847,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"At gate or gap, to stem or turn the flock,"
3848,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And to his office prematurely call'd
3849,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"There stood the urchin, as you will divine,"
3850,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Something between a hindrance and a help,"
3851,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And for this cause not always, I believe,"
3852,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Receiving from his Father hire of praise.
3853,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
3854,_A PASTORAL POEM_,While this good household thus were living on
3855,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"From day to day, to Michael's ear there came"
3856,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Distressful tidings. Long before, the time"
3857,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Of which I speak, the Shepherd had been bound"
3858,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"In surety for his Brother's Son, a man"
3859,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Of an industrious life, and ample means,"
3860,_A PASTORAL POEM_,But unforeseen misfortunes suddenly
3861,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Had press'd upon him, and old Michael now"
3862,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Was summon'd to discharge the forfeiture,"
3863,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"A grievous penalty, but little less"
3864,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Than half his substance. This un-look'd-for claim
3865,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"At the first hearing, for a moment took"
3866,_A PASTORAL POEM_,More hope out of his life than he supposed
3867,_A PASTORAL POEM_,That any old man ever could have lost.
3868,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
3869,_A PASTORAL POEM_,As soon as he had gather'd so much strength
3870,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"That he could look his trouble in the face,"
3871,_A PASTORAL POEM_,It seem'd that his sole refuge was to sell
3872,_A PASTORAL POEM_,A portion of his patrimonial fields.
3873,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Such was his first resolve; he thought again,"
3874,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And his heart fail'd him. ""Isabel,"" said he,"
3875,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Two evenings after he had heard the news,"
3876,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"""I have been toiling more than seventy years,"
3877,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And in the open sun-shine of God's love
3878,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Have we all liv'd, yet if these fields of ours"
3879,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Should pass into a Stranger's hand, I think"
3880,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"That I could not lie quiet in my grave."""
3881,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
3882,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"""Our lot is a hard lot; the Sun itself"
3883,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Has scarcely been more diligent than I,"
3884,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And I have liv'd to be a fool at last
3885,_A PASTORAL POEM_,To my own family. An evil Man
3886,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"That was, and made an evil choice, if he"
3887,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Were false to us; and if he were not false,"
3888,_A PASTORAL POEM_,There are ten thousand to whom loss like this
3889,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Had been no sorrow. I forgive him--but
3890,_A PASTORAL POEM_,'Twere better to be dumb than to talk thus.
3891,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"When I began, my purpose was to speak"
3892,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Of remedies and of a chearful hope."""
3893,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
3894,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"""Our Luke shall leave us, Isabel; the land"
3895,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Shall not go from us, and it shall be free,"
3896,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"He shall possess it, free as is the wind"
3897,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"That passes over it. We have, thou knowest,"
3898,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Another Kinsman, he will be our friend"
3899,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"In this distress. He is a prosperous man,"
3900,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Thriving in trade, and Luke to him shall go,"
3901,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And with his Kinsman's help and his own thrift,"
3902,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"He quickly will repair this loss, and then"
3903,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"May come again to us. If here he stay,"
3904,_A PASTORAL POEM_,What can be done? Where every one is poor
3905,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"What can be gain'd?"" At this, the old man paus'd,"
3906,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And Isabel sate silent, for her mind"
3907,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Was busy, looking back into past times."
3908,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
3909,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"There's Richard Bateman, thought she to herself,"
3910,_A PASTORAL POEM_,He was a parish-boy--at the church-door
3911,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"They made a gathering for him, shillings, pence,"
3912,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And halfpennies, wherewith the Neighbours bought"
3913,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"A Basket, which they fill'd with Pedlar's wares,"
3914,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And with this Basket on his arm, the Lad"
3915,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Went up to London, found a Master there,"
3916,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Who out of many chose the trusty Boy
3917,_A PASTORAL POEM_,To go and overlook his merchandise
3918,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Beyond the seas, where he grew wond'rous rich,"
3919,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And left estates and monies to the poor,"
3920,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And at his birth-place built a Chapel, floor'd"
3921,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"With Marble, which he sent from foreign lands."
3922,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"These thoughts, and many others of like sort,"
3923,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Pass'd quickly thro' the mind of Isabel,"
3924,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And her face brighten'd. The Old Man was glad.
3925,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
3926,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And thus resum'd. ""Well I Isabel, this scheme"
3927,_A PASTORAL POEM_,These two days has been meat and drink to me.
3928,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Far more than we have lost is left us yet.
3929,_A PASTORAL POEM_,--We have enough--I wish indeed that I
3930,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Were younger, but this hope is a good hope."
3931,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"--Make ready Luke's best garments, of the best"
3932,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Buy for him more, and let us send him forth"
3933,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"To-morrow, or the next day, or to-night:"
3934,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"--If he could go, the Boy should go to-night."""
3935,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Here Michael ceas'd, and to the fields went forth"
3936,_A PASTORAL POEM_,With a light heart. The House-wife for five days
3937,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Was restless morn and night, and all day long"
3938,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Wrought on with her best fingers to prepare
3939,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Things needful for the journey of her Son.
3940,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
3941,_A PASTORAL POEM_,But Isabel was glad when Sunday came
3942,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"To stop her in her work; for, when she lay"
3943,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"By Michael's side, she for the two last nights"
3944,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Heard him, how he was troubled in his sleep:"
3945,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And when they rose at morning she could see
3946,_A PASTORAL POEM_,That all his hopes were gone. That day at noon
3947,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"She said to Luke, while they two by themselves"
3948,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Were sitting at the door, ""Thou must not go,"
3949,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"We have no other Child but thee to lose,"
3950,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"None to remember--do not go away,"
3951,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"For if thou leave thy Father he will die."""
3952,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"The Lad made answer with a jocund voice,"
3953,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And Isabel, when she had told her fears,"
3954,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Recover'd heart. That evening her best fare
3955,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Did she bring forth, and all together sate"
3956,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Like happy people round a Christmas fire.
3957,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
3958,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Next morning Isabel resum'd her work,"
3959,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And all the ensuing week the house appear'd
3960,_A PASTORAL POEM_,As cheerful as a grove in Spring: at length
3961,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"The expected letter from their Kinsman came,"
3962,_A PASTORAL POEM_,With kind assurances that he would do
3963,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"His utmost for the welfare of the Boy,"
3964,_A PASTORAL POEM_,To which requests were added that forthwith
3965,_A PASTORAL POEM_,He might be sent to him. Ten times or more
3966,_A PASTORAL POEM_,The letter was read over; Isabel
3967,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Went forth to shew it to the neighbours round:
3968,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Nor was there at that time on English Land
3969,_A PASTORAL POEM_,A prouder heart than Luke's. When Isabel
3970,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Had to her house return'd, the Old Man said,"
3971,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"""He shall depart to-morrow."" To this word"
3972,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"The House--wife answered, talking much of things"
3973,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Which, if at such, short notice he should go,"
3974,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Would surely be forgotten. But at length
3975,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"She gave consent, and Michael was at ease."
3976,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
3977,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Near the tumultuous brook of Green-head Gill,"
3978,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"In that deep Valley, Michael had design'd"
3979,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"To build a Sheep-fold, and, before he heard"
3980,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"The tidings of his melancholy loss,"
3981,_A PASTORAL POEM_,For this same purpose he had gathered up
3982,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"A heap of stones, which close to the brook side"
3983,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Lay thrown together, ready for the work."
3984,_A PASTORAL POEM_,With Luke that evening thitherward he walk'd;
3985,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And soon as they had reach'd the place he stopp'd,"
3986,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And thus the Old Man spake to him. ""My Son,"
3987,_A PASTORAL POEM_,To-morrow thou wilt leave me; with full heart
3988,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"I look upon thee, for thou art the same"
3989,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"That wert a promise to me ere thy birth,"
3990,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And all thy life hast been my daily joy.
3991,_A PASTORAL POEM_,I will relate to thee some little part
3992,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Of our two histories; 'twill do thee good
3993,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"When thou art from me, even if I should speak"
3994,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Of things thou caust not know of.--After thou
3995,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"First cam'st into the world, as it befalls"
3996,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"To new-born infants, thou didst sleep away"
3997,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Two days, and blessings from thy Father's tongue"
3998,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Then fell upon thee. Day by day pass'd on,"
3999,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And still I lov'd thee with encreasing love."""
4000,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
4001,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Never to living ear came sweeter sounds
4002,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Than when I heard thee by our own fire-side
4003,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"First uttering without words a natural tune,"
4004,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"When thou, a feeding babe, didst in thy joy"
4005,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Sing at thy Mother's breast. Month follow'd month,"
4006,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And in the open fields my life was pass'd
4007,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And in the mountains, else I think that thou"
4008,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Hadst been brought up upon thy father's knees.
4009,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"--But we were playmates, Luke; among these hills,"
4010,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"As well thou know'st, in us the old and young"
4011,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Have play'd together, nor with me didst thou"
4012,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Lack any pleasure which a boy can know.
4013,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
4014,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Luke had a manly heart; but at these words
4015,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"He sobb'd aloud; the Old Man grasp'd his hand,"
4016,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And said, ""Nay do not take it so--I see"
4017,_A PASTORAL POEM_,That these are things of which I need not speak.
4018,_A PASTORAL POEM_,--Even to the utmost I have been to thee
4019,_A PASTORAL POEM_,A kind and a good Father: and herein
4020,_A PASTORAL POEM_,I but repay a gift which I myself
4021,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Receiv'd at others' hands, for, though now old"
4022,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Beyond the common life of man, I still"
4023,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Remember them who lov'd me in my youth."""
4024,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
4025,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Both of them sleep together: here they liv'd
4026,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"As all their Forefathers had done, and when"
4027,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"At length their time was come, they were not loth"
4028,_A PASTORAL POEM_,To give their bodies to the family mold.
4029,_A PASTORAL POEM_,I wish'd that thou should'st live the life they liv'd.
4030,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"But 'tis a long time to look back, my Son,"
4031,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And see so little gain from sixty years.
4032,_A PASTORAL POEM_,These fields were burthen'd when they came to me;
4033,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"'Till I was forty years of age, not more"
4034,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Than half of my inheritance was mine.
4035,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
4036,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"""I toil'd and toil'd; God bless'd me in my work,"
4037,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And 'till these three weeks past the land was free.
4038,_A PASTORAL POEM_,--It looks as if it never could endure
4039,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Another Master. Heaven forgive me, Luke,"
4040,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"If I judge ill for thee, but it seems good"
4041,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"That thou should'st go."" At this the Old Man paus'd,"
4042,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Then, pointing to the Stones near which they stood,"
4043,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Thus, after a short silence, he resum'd:"
4044,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"""This was a work for us, and now, my Son,"
4045,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"It is a work for me. But, lay one Stone--"
4046,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Here, lay it for me, Luke, with thine own hands."
4047,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"I for the purpose brought thee to this place."""
4048,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
4049,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Nay, Boy, be of good hope:--we both may live"
4050,_A PASTORAL POEM_,To see a better day. At eighty-four
4051,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"I still am strong and stout;--do thou thy part,"
4052,_A PASTORAL POEM_,I will do mine.--I will begin again
4053,_A PASTORAL POEM_,With many tasks that were resign'd to thee;
4054,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Up to the heights, and in among the storms,"
4055,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Will I without thee go again, and do"
4056,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"All works which I was wont to do alone,"
4057,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Before I knew thy face.--Heaven bless thee, Boy!"
4058,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast
4059,_A PASTORAL POEM_,With many hopes--it should be so--yes--yes--
4060,_A PASTORAL POEM_,I knew that thou could'st never have a wish
4061,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"To leave me, Luke, thou hast been bound to me"
4062,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Only by links of love, when thou art gone"
4063,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"What will be left to us!--But, I forget"
4064,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"My purposes. Lay now the corner-stone,"
4065,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"As I requested, and hereafter, Luke,"
4066,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"When thou art gone away, should evil men"
4067,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Be thy companions, let this Sheep-fold be"
4068,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Thy anchor and thy shield; amid all fear
4069,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And all temptation, let it be to thee"
4070,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"An emblem of the life thy Fathers liv'd,"
4071,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Who, being innocent, did for that cause"
4072,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Bestir them in good deeds. Now, fare thee well--"
4073,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"When thou return'st, thou in this place wilt see"
4074,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"A work which is not here, a covenant"
4075,_A PASTORAL POEM_,'Twill be between us--but whatever fate
4076,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Befall thee, I shall love thee to the last,"
4077,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And bear thy memory with me to the grave.
4078,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
4079,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"The Shepherd ended here; and Luke stoop'd down,"
4080,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"And as his Father had requested, laid"
4081,_A PASTORAL POEM_,The first stone of the Sheep-fold; at the sight
4082,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"The Old Man's grief broke from him, to his heart"
4083,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"He press'd his Son, he kissed him and wept;"
4084,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And to the House together they return'd.
4085,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
4086,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Next morning, as had been resolv'd, the Boy"
4087,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Began his journey, and when he had reach'd"
4088,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"The public Way, he put on a bold face;"
4089,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And all the Neighbours as he pass'd their doors
4090,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Came forth, with wishes and with farewell pray'rs,"
4091,_A PASTORAL POEM_,That follow'd him 'till he was out of sight.
4092,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
4093,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"A good report did from their Kinsman come,"
4094,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Of Luke and his well-doing; and the Boy
4095,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Wrote loving letters, full of wond'rous news,"
4096,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Which, as the House-wife phrased it, were throughout"
4097,_A PASTORAL POEM_,The prettiest letters that were ever seen.
4098,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
4099,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Both parents read them with rejoicing hearts.
4100,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"So, many months pass'd on: and once again"
4101,_A PASTORAL POEM_,The Shepherd went about his daily work
4102,_A PASTORAL POEM_,With confident and cheerful thoughts; and now
4103,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Sometimes when he could find a leisure hour
4104,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"He to that valley took his way, and there"
4105,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Wrought at the Sheep-fold. Meantime Luke began
4106,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"To slacken in his duty, and at length"
4107,_A PASTORAL POEM_,He in the dissolute city gave himself
4108,_A PASTORAL POEM_,To evil courses: ignominy and shame
4109,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Fell on him, so that he was driven at last"
4110,_A PASTORAL POEM_,To seek a hiding-place beyond the seas.
4111,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
4112,_A PASTORAL POEM_,There is a comfort in the strength of love;
4113,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"'Twill make a thing endurable, which else"
4114,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Would break the heart:--Old Michael found it so.
4115,_A PASTORAL POEM_,I have convers'd with more than one who well
4116,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Remember the Old Man, and what he was"
4117,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Years after he had heard this heavy news.
4118,_A PASTORAL POEM_,His bodily frame had been from youth to age
4119,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Of an unusual strength. Among the rocks
4120,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"He went, and still look'd up upon the sun."
4121,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And listen'd to the wind; and as before
4122,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Perform'd all kinds of labour for his Sheep,"
4123,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And for the land his small inheritance.
4124,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
4125,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And to that hollow Dell from time to time
4126,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Did he repair, to build the Fold of which"
4127,_A PASTORAL POEM_,His flock had need. 'Tis not forgotten yet
4128,_A PASTORAL POEM_,The pity which was then in every heart
4129,_A PASTORAL POEM_,For the Old Man--ands 'tis believ'd by all
4130,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"That many and many a day he thither went,"
4131,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And never lifted up a single stone.
4132,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
4133,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"There, by the Sheep-fold, sometimes was he seen"
4134,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Sitting alone, with that his faithful Dog,"
4135,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Then old, beside him, lying at his feet."
4136,_A PASTORAL POEM_,The length of full seven years from time to time
4137,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"He at the building of this Sheep-fold wrought,"
4138,_A PASTORAL POEM_,And left the work unfinished when he died.
4139,_A PASTORAL POEM_,
4140,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Three years, or little more, did Isabel,"
4141,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Survive her Husband: at her death the estate
4142,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Was sold, and went into a Stranger's hand."
4143,_A PASTORAL POEM_,The Cottage which was nam'd The Evening Star
4144,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"Is gone, the ploughshare has been through the ground"
4145,_A PASTORAL POEM_,On which it stood; great changes have been wrought
4146,_A PASTORAL POEM_,"In all the neighbourhood, yet the Oak is left"
4147,_A PASTORAL POEM_,That grew beside their Door; and the remains
4148,_A PASTORAL POEM_,Of the unfinished Sheep-fold may be seen

4169,NOTE II.,There is not any thing more worthy of remark in the manners of the
4170,NOTE II.,"inhabitants of these mountains, than the tranquillity, I might say"
4171,NOTE II.,"indifference, with which they think and talk upon the subject of"
4172,NOTE II.,"death. Some of the country church-yards, as here described, do not"
4173,NOTE II.,"contain a single tombstone, and most of them have a very small number."

4187,NOTE II.,"may be proper to inform some readers, that a sheep-fold in these"
4188,NOTE II.,"mountains is an unroofed building of stone walls, with different"
4189,NOTE II.,"divisions. It is generally placed by the side of a brook, for the"
4190,NOTE II.,convenience of washing the sheep; but it is also useful as a shelter
4191,NOTE II.,"for them, and as a place to drive them into, to enable the shepherds"
4192,NOTE II.,conveniently to single out one or more for any particular purpose.
