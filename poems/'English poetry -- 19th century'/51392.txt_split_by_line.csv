111,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._
112,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
113,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
114,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,Hafiz in London! even so.
115,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,For not alone by Rukni’s flow
116,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,The ruddy Persian roses grow.
117,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
118,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"Not only ’neath the cypress groves,"
119,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"With soul on fire the singer roves,"
120,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,And tells the laughing stars his loves.
121,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
122,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,Here in this city--where I brood
123,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"Beside the river’s darkling flood,"
124,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,And feed the fever in my blood
125,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
126,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,With Eastern fancies quaintly traced
127,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"On yellow parchment, half effaced"
128,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,In verses subtly interlaced--
129,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
130,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"Men eat and drink, men love and die,"
131,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"Beneath this leaden London sky,"
132,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"As eastward where the hoopoos fly,"
133,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
134,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,And through the tranquil evening air
135,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,A muezzin from the turret stair
136,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,Summons all faithful souls to prayer.
137,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
138,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,And we who drink the Saki’s wine
139,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,Believe its juice no less divine
140,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"Than filled, Hafiz, that cup of thine."
141,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
142,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"Master and most benign of shades,"
143,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,Before thy gracious phantom fades
144,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"To Mosellay’s enchanted glades,"
145,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
146,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"Breathe on my lips, and o’er my brain"
147,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"Some comfort for thy child, whose pain"
148,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"Strives as you strove, but strives in vain."
149,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
150,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"When sundown sets the world on fire,"
151,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,The music of the Master’s lyre
152,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,Deadens the ache of keen desire.
153,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
154,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"Reading this painted Persian page,"
155,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"Where, half a lover, half a sage,"
156,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"You built your heart a golden cage,"
157,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
158,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"My fancy, skimming southern seas,"
159,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,Wanders at twilight where the breeze
160,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,Flutters the dark pomegranate trees.
161,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
162,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,We all are sultans in our dreams
163,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,Of gardens where the sunlight gleams
164,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,On fairer flowers and clearer streams;
165,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
166,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,And thus in dreams I seek my home
167,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"Where dim Shiraz, dome after dome,"
168,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,Smiles on the water’s silver foam;
169,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
170,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"The dancing girls, with tinkling feet"
171,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"And many-coloured garments, beat"
172,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,Their drums adown the twisted street;
173,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
174,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"And while the revel sways along,"
175,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"The scented, flower-crowned, laughing throng"
176,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,Seem part and parcel of thy song.
177,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,
178,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"Hafiz, night’s rebel angels sweep"
179,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"Across the sun; I pledge you deep,"
180,_HAFIZ IN LONDON._,"And smiling, sighing, sink to sleep."

185,_MEMORY._,_MEMORY._
186,_MEMORY._,
187,_MEMORY._,
188,_MEMORY._,"Sitting silent in the twilight, faces of my former loves"
189,_MEMORY._,"Float about my fancy softly, like a silver flight of doves."
190,_MEMORY._,
191,_MEMORY._,"Brighter than the stars of heaven is the shining of their eyes,"
192,_MEMORY._,Sweeter are their angel voices than the speech of Paradise.
193,_MEMORY._,
194,_MEMORY._,"I am old and grey and weary, winter in my blood and brain;"
195,_MEMORY._,But to-night these haunting phantoms conjure up my youth again.
196,_MEMORY._,
197,_MEMORY._,"Lovingly I name them over, all that world of gracious girls,"
198,_MEMORY._,"Almond-eyed and jasmine-bosomed, like a poet stringing pearls."
199,_MEMORY._,
200,_MEMORY._,"In my tranquil cypress mazes just outside the sleepy town,"
201,_MEMORY._,Blooms a tribe of laughing lilies fairer than a kingly crown.
202,_MEMORY._,
203,_MEMORY._,"Every lily in the garden wears a woman’s gracious name,"
204,_MEMORY._,Every lily in the garden set my spirit once aflame;
205,_MEMORY._,
206,_MEMORY._,"And amongst that throng of lilies scarcely whiter than his hair,"
207,_MEMORY._,Hafiz sits and dreams at sunset of the flowers no longer fair;
208,_MEMORY._,
209,_MEMORY._,"Of the sweethearts dead and buried whom I worshipped long ago,"
210,_MEMORY._,When this beard as grey as ashes was as sable as the sloe.
211,_MEMORY._,
212,_MEMORY._,"I would weep if I were wiser, but the idle child of song"
213,_MEMORY._,"Leaves reflection to the Mullah, sorrow to the Sufi throng."
214,_MEMORY._,
215,_MEMORY._,Am I wrong to be contented in the sunlight to rehearse
216,_MEMORY._,Pleasant tales of love and lovers in my honey-laden verse?
217,_MEMORY._,
218,_MEMORY._,"While the vinepress with the life-blood of the purple clusters drips,"
219,_MEMORY._,"I forget how slowly, surely, day by day to darkness slips,"
220,_MEMORY._,
221,_MEMORY._,"Heedless how beyond the gateway in the field the nations jar,"
222,_MEMORY._,Hand on throat and hand on sabre in the trampled lanes of war.
223,_MEMORY._,
224,_MEMORY._,"Ah! ’tis better on this pleasant river bank to lie reclined,"
225,_MEMORY._,While the ghosts of old affections fill the harem of my mind.
226,_MEMORY._,
227,_MEMORY._,"Think no more of love and lasses, Hafiz; you can scarcely hold"
228,_MEMORY._,"The Koran with trembling fingers. Hafiz, you are growing old."

233,_ELD._,_ELD._
234,_ELD._,
235,_ELD._,
236,_ELD._,"Hafiz, you are growing old;"
237,_ELD._,"Hafiz, all the girls abandon"
238,_ELD._,"Bards whose blood is getting cold,"
239,_ELD._,Bards whom Time has laid his hand on.
240,_ELD._,All the merry songs you sung
241,_ELD._,"In the days when you were young,"
242,_ELD._,Are not worth a feather’s weight
243,_ELD._,To arrest the fist of Fate
244,_ELD._,When it jogs your shifting sand on.
245,_ELD._,
246,_ELD._,"Hafiz, though a tinge of grey"
247,_ELD._,"Shames the locks that once were sable,"
248,_ELD._,"Drink and laugh the world away,"
249,_ELD._,Swear that eld’s a housewife’s fable;
250,_ELD._,Vow that youth is always yours
251,_ELD._,"While the graceful gait allures,"
252,_ELD._,"While the perfume haunts the rose,"
253,_ELD._,While a ruddy balsam flows
254,_ELD._,From the flagon on the table.
255,_ELD._,
256,_ELD._,"Just a word within your ear,"
257,_ELD._,Hafiz: you’re a craven creature
258,_ELD._,If you waste a single tear
259,_ELD._,On the thought that every feature
260,_ELD._,Of the fairest face a maid
261,_ELD._,Ever showed the sun must fade;
262,_ELD._,Rather bid your mistress weigh
263,_ELD._,"Youth and beauty’s barren stay,"
264,_ELD._,And a wiser lesson teach her.
265,_ELD._,
266,_ELD._,Tell her youth was made for love;
267,_ELD._,Tell her wine was made for drinking;
268,_ELD._,Tell her that in heaven above
269,_ELD._,Mahmoud and his saints are winking
270,_ELD._,At the golden jest of youth;
271,_ELD._,Tell her wisdom’s wisest truth
272,_ELD._,"Is, be merry while you may,"
273,_ELD._,"Cease regretting yesterday,"
274,_ELD._,Or about to-morrow thinking.

279,_LONG AGO._,_LONG AGO._
280,_LONG AGO._,
281,_LONG AGO._,
282,_LONG AGO._,"All my youth’s desires are buried,"
283,_LONG AGO._,Each within its narrow grave;
284,_LONG AGO._,Long ago their ghosts were ferried
285,_LONG AGO._,O’er Jaihun’s enchanted wave;
286,_LONG AGO._,"Wild ambitions bright and brave,"
287,_LONG AGO._,"Loves that made me serve a slave,"
288,_LONG AGO._,All have slipped away like snow
289,_LONG AGO._,Long ago.
290,_LONG AGO._,
291,_LONG AGO._,Stars in which my youth delighted
292,_LONG AGO._,"Vanish from the heavenly band,"
293,_LONG AGO._,And I wander a benighted
294,_LONG AGO._,Stranger in a stranger land;
295,_LONG AGO._,There is no one left to stand
296,_LONG AGO._,"By my side or take my hand,"
297,_LONG AGO._,Of the friends I worshipped so
298,_LONG AGO._,Long ago.
299,_LONG AGO._,
300,_LONG AGO._,One sweet name of all the number
301,_LONG AGO._,"Haunts the chambers of my brain,"
302,_LONG AGO._,"One sweet shape disturbs my slumber,"
303,_LONG AGO._,Loved too well and loved in vain.
304,_LONG AGO._,"Ah, Ferangis! give again"
305,_LONG AGO._,"Half the pleasure, all the pain,"
306,_LONG AGO._,That my boyhood used to know
307,_LONG AGO._,Long ago.
308,_LONG AGO._,
309,_LONG AGO._,These are dreams: I must remember
310,_LONG AGO._,"That my youthful days are dead,"
311,_LONG AGO._,That the rigours of December
312,_LONG AGO._,Grizzle e’en a poet’s head.
313,_LONG AGO._,"Gone is gone, and dead is dead,"
314,_LONG AGO._,And no roses bloom as red
315,_LONG AGO._,As the roses used to blow
316,_LONG AGO._,Long ago.
317,_LONG AGO._,
318,_LONG AGO._,Though my eyes pursue the swallow
319,_LONG AGO._,"As he travels towards the sun,"
320,_LONG AGO._,Aged limbs refuse to follow
321,_LONG AGO._,Where the fancies lightly run.
322,_LONG AGO._,"Hafiz, cease, the game is done,"
323,_LONG AGO._,Life’s fantastic robe is spun;
324,_LONG AGO._,Fate marked out the way to go
325,_LONG AGO._,Long ago.
326,_LONG AGO._,
327,_LONG AGO._,"You were passionate, my poet,"
328,_LONG AGO._,In your manhood’s golden dawn;
329,_LONG AGO._,Seized the seed of life to sow it
330,_LONG AGO._,On the tulip-tinted lawn;
331,_LONG AGO._,"Now you sit at home and yawn,"
332,_LONG AGO._,"Withered, grizzled, bent and drawn,"
333,_LONG AGO._,By the hearth: you scorned its glow
334,_LONG AGO._,Long ago.
335,_LONG AGO._,
336,_LONG AGO._,"What is left? a sigh, a shudder,"
337,_LONG AGO._,"For my past, and for the goal"
338,_LONG AGO._,"Where, a boat without a rudder,"
339,_LONG AGO._,Drifts my tempest-troubled soul;
340,_LONG AGO._,"Ah! death’s angel, taking toll,"
341,_LONG AGO._,Shall I find within thy bowl
342,_LONG AGO._,Better wine than used to flow
343,_LONG AGO._,Long ago?

349,_VANITY._,
350,_VANITY._,
351,_VANITY._,I dreamt all night of your cold caresses;
352,_VANITY._,Your kisses froze on my lips like flakes
353,_VANITY._,Of pitiless snow that chills and breaks
354,_VANITY._,The warm heart snared in your sombre tresses.
355,_VANITY._,
356,_VANITY._,"I woke with a groan in the livid morning,"
357,_VANITY._,Groaned and swore I would break away
358,_VANITY._,"From the bitter bondage of love, and repay"
359,_VANITY._,"Laughter with laughter, and scorn with scorning."
360,_VANITY._,
361,_VANITY._,"Ere noon was hot in the heavens, I met you;"
362,_VANITY._,"You had but to smile as you passed, and lo!"
363,_VANITY._,I was your lover again. Heigho!

373,_KAIF._,"Mine be the ample flagon, brimmed with the blood of the vine;"
374,_KAIF._,"Mine the divan encushioned, watching the dancers twirl;"
375,_KAIF._,"Mine the narghili serpent, breathing its soul divine."
376,_KAIF._,
377,_KAIF._,"Others can juggle with statecraft, others can lust for command;"
378,_KAIF._,Others can envy their fellows woman or vintage or gold;
379,_KAIF._,"Others can wrangle for title, fight for a rood of land;"
380,_KAIF._,Others think souls and bodies things to be bought and sold.
381,_KAIF._,
382,_KAIF._,"Such as they are, God made them; such as they are, God guides;"
383,_KAIF._,"Such as they are, they do their task, fill place in the world"
384,_KAIF._,awhile;
385,_KAIF._,"Such as they are, they eat and drink, and sleep on the breasts of"
386,_KAIF._,their brides;
387,_KAIF._,"Such as they are, they sicken and die--may jackals their graves"
388,_KAIF._,defile.

390,_KAIF._,"I for my part am happy, I for my part am calm,"
391,_KAIF._,"I for my part rejoice to the full in the hour that glideth by,"
392,_KAIF._,"I for my part with all my heart delight in the vineyard’s balm,"
393,_KAIF._,I for my part will love and laugh till my moment comes to die.
394,_KAIF._,
395,_KAIF._,"Grant me, Allah, digestion; grant me, Allah, desire;"
396,_KAIF._,Grant me a mistress with almond eyes and cinnamon-scented breath;

398,_KAIF._,"Grant me, Allah, a lazy life, and later a lazy death."
399,_KAIF._,
400,_KAIF._,"Dearest, I once was foolish; dearest, I once was young;"
401,_KAIF._,"Dearest, I once would have sold my soul for the price of a"
402,_KAIF._,passionate kiss;
403,_KAIF._,"Dearest, you know what your lover was when the songs of his youth"
404,_KAIF._,were sung;
