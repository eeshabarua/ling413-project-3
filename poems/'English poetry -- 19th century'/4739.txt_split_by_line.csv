76,MORNING.,MORNING.
77,MORNING.,
78,MORNING.,
79,MORNING.,’TIS the hour when white-horsed Day
80,MORNING.,Chases Night her mares away;
81,MORNING.,When the Gates of Dawn (they say)
82,MORNING.,Phœbus opes:
83,MORNING.,And I gather that the Queen
84,MORNING.,"May be uniformly seen,"
85,MORNING.,"Should the weather be serene,"
86,MORNING.,On the slopes.
87,MORNING.,
88,MORNING.,"When the ploughman, as he goes"
89,MORNING.,"Leathern-gaitered o’er the snows,"
90,MORNING.,From his hat and from his nose
91,MORNING.,Knocks the ice;
92,MORNING.,"And the panes are frosted o’er,"
93,MORNING.,"And the lawn is crisp and hoar,"
94,MORNING.,As has been observed before
95,MORNING.,Once or twice.
96,MORNING.,
97,MORNING.,When arrayed in breastplate red
98,MORNING.,"Sings the robin, for his bread,"
99,MORNING.,On the elmtree that hath shed
100,MORNING.,Every leaf;
101,MORNING.,"While, within, the frost benumbs"
102,MORNING.,"The still sleepy schoolboy’s thumbs,"
103,MORNING.,And in consequence his sums
104,MORNING.,Come to grief.
105,MORNING.,
106,MORNING.,"But when breakfast-time hath come,"
107,MORNING.,"And he’s crunching crust and crumb,"
108,MORNING.,He’ll no longer look a glum
109,MORNING.,Little dunce;
110,MORNING.,But be brisk as bees that settle
111,MORNING.,On a summer rose’s petal:
112,MORNING.,"Wherefore, Polly, put the kettle"
113,MORNING.,On at once.

119,EVENING.,
120,EVENING.,
121,EVENING.,KATE! if e’er thy light foot lingers
122,EVENING.,"On the lawn, when up the fells"
123,EVENING.,"Steals the Dark, and fairy fingers"
124,EVENING.,Close unseen the pimpernels:
125,EVENING.,"When, his thighs with sweetness laden,"
126,EVENING.,"From the meadow comes the bee,"
127,EVENING.,And the lover and the maiden
128,EVENING.,Stand beneath the trysting tree:—
129,EVENING.,
130,EVENING.,"Lingers on, till stars unnumber’d"
131,EVENING.,"Tremble in the breeze-swept tarn,"
132,EVENING.,And the bat that all day slumber’d
133,EVENING.,Flits about the lonely barn;
134,EVENING.,And the shapes that shrink from garish
135,EVENING.,Noon are peopling cairn and lea;
136,EVENING.,And thy sire is almost bearish
137,EVENING.,If kept waiting for his tea:—
138,EVENING.,
139,EVENING.,And the screech-owl scares the peasant
140,EVENING.,As he skirts some churchyard drear;
141,EVENING.,And the goblins whisper pleasant
142,EVENING.,Tales in Miss Rossetti’s ear;
143,EVENING.,"Importuning her in strangest,"
144,EVENING.,Sweetest tones to buy their fruits:—
145,EVENING.,"O be careful that thou changest,"
146,EVENING.,"On returning home, thy boots."

151,SHELTER.,SHELTER.
152,SHELTER.,
153,SHELTER.,
154,SHELTER.,BY the wide lake’s margin I mark’d her lie—
155,SHELTER.,"The wide, weird lake where the alders sigh—"
156,SHELTER.,"A young fair thing, with a shy, soft eye;"
157,SHELTER.,And I deem’d that her thoughts had flown
158,SHELTER.,"To her home, and her brethren, and sisters dear,"
159,SHELTER.,"As she lay there watching the dark, deep mere,"
160,SHELTER.,"All motionless, all alone."
161,SHELTER.,
162,SHELTER.,"Then I heard a noise, as of men and boys,"
163,SHELTER.,And a boisterous troop drew nigh.
164,SHELTER.,Whither now will retreat those fairy feet?
165,SHELTER.,Where hide till the storm pass by?
166,SHELTER.,One glance—the wild glance of a hunted thing—
167,SHELTER.,She cast behind her; she gave one spring;
168,SHELTER.,And there follow’d a splash and a broadening ring
169,SHELTER.,On the lake where the alders sigh.
170,SHELTER.,
171,SHELTER.,She had gone from the ken of ungentle men!
172,SHELTER.,Yet scarce did I mourn for that;
173,SHELTER.,"For I knew she was safe in her own home then,"
174,SHELTER.,"And, the danger past, would appear again,"
175,SHELTER.,For she was a water-rat.

181,IN THE GLOAMING.,
182,IN THE GLOAMING.,
183,IN THE GLOAMING.,"IN the Gloaming to be roaming, where the crested waves are foaming,"
184,IN THE GLOAMING.,And the shy mermaidens combing locks that ripple to their feet;
185,IN THE GLOAMING.,"When the Gloaming is, I never made the ghost of an endeavour"
186,IN THE GLOAMING.,"To discover—but whatever were the hour, it would be sweet."
187,IN THE GLOAMING.,
188,IN THE GLOAMING.,"“To their feet,” I say, for Leech’s sketch indisputably teaches"
189,IN THE GLOAMING.,"That the mermaids of our beaches do not end in ugly tails,"
190,IN THE GLOAMING.,"Nor have homes among the corals; but are shod with neat balmorals,"
191,IN THE GLOAMING.,"An arrangement no one quarrels with, as many might with scales."
192,IN THE GLOAMING.,
193,IN THE GLOAMING.,"Sweet to roam beneath a shady cliff, of course with some young lady,"
194,IN THE GLOAMING.,"Lalage, Neæra, Haidee, or Elaine, or Mary Ann:"
195,IN THE GLOAMING.,"Love, you dear delusive dream, you!  Very sweet your victims deem you,"
196,IN THE GLOAMING.,"When, heard only by the seamew, they talk all the stuff one can."
197,IN THE GLOAMING.,
198,IN THE GLOAMING.,"Sweet to haste, a licensed lover, to Miss Pinkerton the glover,"
199,IN THE GLOAMING.,Having managed to discover what is dear Neæra’s “size”:
200,IN THE GLOAMING.,"P’raps to touch that wrist so slender, as your tiny gift you tender,"
201,IN THE GLOAMING.,"And to read you’re no offender, in those laughing hazel eyes."
202,IN THE GLOAMING.,
203,IN THE GLOAMING.,"Then to hear her call you “Harry,” when she makes you fetch and carry—"
204,IN THE GLOAMING.,"O young men about to marry, what a blessed thing it is!"
205,IN THE GLOAMING.,To be photograph’d—together—cased in pretty Russia leather—
206,IN THE GLOAMING.,Hear her gravely doubting whether they have spoilt your honest
207,IN THE GLOAMING.,phiz!
208,IN THE GLOAMING.,
209,IN THE GLOAMING.,Then to bring your plighted fair one first a ring—a rich and rare one—
210,IN THE GLOAMING.,"Next a bracelet, if she’ll wear one, and a heap of things beside;"
211,IN THE GLOAMING.,"And serenely bending o’er her, to inquire if it would bore her"
212,IN THE GLOAMING.,To say when her own adorer may aspire to call her bride!
213,IN THE GLOAMING.,
214,IN THE GLOAMING.,"Then, the days of courtship over, with your WIFE to start for Dover"
215,IN THE GLOAMING.,"Or Dieppe—and live in clover evermore, whate’er befalls:"
216,IN THE GLOAMING.,"For I’ve read in many a novel that, unless they’ve souls that grovel,"
217,IN THE GLOAMING.,Folks _prefer_ in fact a hovel to your dreary marble halls:
218,IN THE GLOAMING.,
219,IN THE GLOAMING.,"To sit, happy married lovers; Phillis trifling with a plover’s"
220,IN THE GLOAMING.,"Egg, while Corydon uncovers with a grace the Sally Lunn,"
221,IN THE GLOAMING.,"Or dissects the lucky pheasant—that, I think, were passing pleasant;"
222,IN THE GLOAMING.,"As I sit alone at present, dreaming darkly of a Dun."

228,THE PALACE.,
229,THE PALACE.,
230,THE PALACE.,"THEY come, they come, with fife and drum,"
231,THE PALACE.,And gleaming pikes and glancing banners:
232,THE PALACE.,"Though the eyes flash, the lips are dumb;"
233,THE PALACE.,To talk in rank would not be manners.
234,THE PALACE.,"Onward they stride, as Britons can;"
235,THE PALACE.,The ladies following in the Van.
236,THE PALACE.,
237,THE PALACE.,"Who, who be these that tramp in threes"
238,THE PALACE.,"Through sumptuous Piccadilly, through"
239,THE PALACE.,"The roaring Strand, and stand at ease"
240,THE PALACE.,At last ’neath shadowy Waterloo?
241,THE PALACE.,"Some gallant Guild, I ween, are they;"
242,THE PALACE.,Taking their annual holiday.
243,THE PALACE.,
244,THE PALACE.,To catch the destin’d train—to pay
245,THE PALACE.,"Their willing fares, and plunge within it—"
246,THE PALACE.,"Is, as in old Romaunt they say,"
247,THE PALACE.,With them the work of half-a-minute.
248,THE PALACE.,"Then off they’re whirl’d, with songs and shouting,"
249,THE PALACE.,To cedared Sydenham for their outing.
250,THE PALACE.,
251,THE PALACE.,"I mark’d them light, with faces bright"
252,THE PALACE.,"As pansies or a new coin’d florin,"
253,THE PALACE.,"And up the sunless stair take flight,"
254,THE PALACE.,Close-pack’d as rabbits in a warren.
255,THE PALACE.,"Honour the Brave, who in that stress"
256,THE PALACE.,Still trod not upon Beauty’s dress!
257,THE PALACE.,
258,THE PALACE.,Kerchief in hand I saw them stand;
259,THE PALACE.,In every kerchief lurk’d a lunch;
260,THE PALACE.,"When they unfurl’d them, it was grand"
261,THE PALACE.,To watch bronzed men and maidens crunch
262,THE PALACE.,"The sounding celery-stick, or ram"
263,THE PALACE.,The knife into the blushing ham.
264,THE PALACE.,
265,THE PALACE.,Dash’d the bold fork through pies of pork;
266,THE PALACE.,O’er hard-boil’d eggs the saltspoon shook;
267,THE PALACE.,Leapt from its lair the playful cork:
268,THE PALACE.,"Yet some there were, to whom the brook"
269,THE PALACE.,"Seem’d sweetest beverage, and for meat"
270,THE PALACE.,They chose the red root of the beet.
271,THE PALACE.,
272,THE PALACE.,"Then many a song, some rather long,"
273,THE PALACE.,Came quivering up from girlish throats;
274,THE PALACE.,"And one young man he came out strong,"
275,THE PALACE.,And gave “The Wolf” without his notes.
276,THE PALACE.,While they who knew not song or ballad
277,THE PALACE.,"Still munch’d, approvingly, their salad."
278,THE PALACE.,
279,THE PALACE.,"But ah! what bard could sing how hard,"
280,THE PALACE.,"The artless banquet o’er, they ran"
281,THE PALACE.,Down the soft slope with daisies starr’d
282,THE PALACE.,"And kingcups! onward, maid with man,"
283,THE PALACE.,"They flew, to scale the breezy swing,"
284,THE PALACE.,Or court frank kisses in the ring.
285,THE PALACE.,
286,THE PALACE.,Such are the sylvan scenes that thrill
287,THE PALACE.,"This heart!  The lawns, the happy shade,"
288,THE PALACE.,"Where matrons, whom the sunbeams grill,"
289,THE PALACE.,Stir with slow spoon their lemonade;
290,THE PALACE.,And maidens flirt (no extra charge)
291,THE PALACE.,In comfort at the fountain’s marge!
292,THE PALACE.,
293,THE PALACE.,Others may praise the “grand displays”
294,THE PALACE.,"Where “fiery arch,” “cascade,” and “comet,”"
295,THE PALACE.,Set the whole garden in a “blaze”!
296,THE PALACE.,"Far, at such times, may I be from it;"
297,THE PALACE.,Though then the public may be “lost
298,THE PALACE.,In wonder” at a trifling cost.
299,THE PALACE.,
300,THE PALACE.,"Fann’d by the breeze, to puff at ease"
301,THE PALACE.,My faithful pipe is all I crave:
302,THE PALACE.,And if folks rave about the “trees
303,THE PALACE.,"Lit up by fireworks,” let them rave."
304,THE PALACE.,"Your monster fêtes, I like not these;"
305,THE PALACE.,Though they bring grist to the lessees.

314,A STUDY.,"HE stood, a worn-out City clerk—"
315,A STUDY.,"Who’d toil’d, and seen no holiday,"
316,A STUDY.,For forty years from dawn to dark—
317,A STUDY.,Alone beside Caermarthen Bay.
318,A STUDY.,
319,A STUDY.,He felt the salt spray on his lips;
320,A STUDY.,Heard children’s voices on the sands;
321,A STUDY.,Up the sun’s path he saw the ships
322,A STUDY.,Sail on and on to other lands;
323,A STUDY.,
324,A STUDY.,And laugh’d aloud.  Each sight and sound
325,A STUDY.,To him was joy too deep for tears;
326,A STUDY.,"He sat him on the beach, and bound"
327,A STUDY.,A blue bandana round his ears:
328,A STUDY.,
329,A STUDY.,"And thought how, posted near his door,"
330,A STUDY.,"His own green door on Camden Hill,"
331,A STUDY.,"Two bands at least, most likely more,"
332,A STUDY.,Were mingling at their own sweet will
333,A STUDY.,
334,A STUDY.,Verdi with Vance.  And at the thought
335,A STUDY.,"He laugh’d again, and softly drew"

1715,FLIGHT.,Original joke.
1716,FLIGHT.,
1717,FLIGHT.,What was it?  I know I was brushing
1718,FLIGHT.,My hair when the notion occurred:
1719,FLIGHT.,I know that I felt myself blushing
1720,FLIGHT.,"As I thought, “How supremely absurd!"
1721,FLIGHT.,“How they’ll hammer on floor and on table
1722,FLIGHT.,“As its drollery dawns on them—how
1723,FLIGHT.,They will quote it”—I wish I were able
1724,FLIGHT.,To quote it just now.
1725,FLIGHT.,
1726,FLIGHT.,I had thought to lead up conversation
1727,FLIGHT.,To the subject—it’s easily done—
1728,FLIGHT.,"Then let off, as an airy creation"
1729,FLIGHT.,"Of the moment, that masterly pun."
1730,FLIGHT.,"Let it off, with a flash like a rocket’s;"
1731,FLIGHT.,"In the midst of a dazzled conclave,"
1732,FLIGHT.,"Where I sat, with my hands in my pockets,"
1733,FLIGHT.,The only one grave.

1735,FLIGHT.,"I had fancied young Titterton’s chuckles,"
1736,FLIGHT.,And old Bottleby’s hearty guffaws

1739,FLIGHT.,While Jean Bottleby—queenly Miss Janet—
1740,FLIGHT.,"Drew her handkerchief hastily out,"
1741,FLIGHT.,In fits at my slyness—what can it
1742,FLIGHT.,Have all been about?
1743,FLIGHT.,
1744,FLIGHT.,"I know ’twas the happiest, quaintest"
1745,FLIGHT.,Combination of pathos and fun:
1746,FLIGHT.,But I’ve got no idea—the faintest—
1747,FLIGHT.,Of what was the actual pun.
1748,FLIGHT.,I think it was somehow connected
1749,FLIGHT.,With something I’d recently read—
1750,FLIGHT.,Or heard—or perhaps recollected
1751,FLIGHT.,On going to bed.
1752,FLIGHT.,
1753,FLIGHT.,What _had_ I been reading?  The _Standard_:
1754,FLIGHT.,“Double Bigamy;” “Speech of the Mayor.”
1755,FLIGHT.,And later—eh? yes!  I meandered
1756,FLIGHT.,Through some chapters of Vanity Fair.
1757,FLIGHT.,How it fuses the grave with the festive!
1758,FLIGHT.,"Yet e’en there, there is nothing so fine—"
1759,FLIGHT.,"So playfully, subtly suggestive—"
1760,FLIGHT.,As that joke of mine.
1761,FLIGHT.,
1762,FLIGHT.,Did it hinge upon “parting asunder?”
1763,FLIGHT.,"No, I don’t part my hair with my brush."
1764,FLIGHT.,Was the point of it “hair?”  Now I wonder!
1765,FLIGHT.,Stop a bit—I shall think of it—hush!
1766,FLIGHT.,"There’s _hare_, a wild animal—Stuff!"
1767,FLIGHT.,It was something a deal more recondite:
1768,FLIGHT.,Of that I am certain enough;
1769,FLIGHT.,And of nothing beyond it.
1770,FLIGHT.,
1771,FLIGHT.,Hair—_locks_!  There are probably many
1772,FLIGHT.,Good things to be said about those.
1773,FLIGHT.,Give me time—that’s the best guess of any—
1774,FLIGHT.,"“Lock” has several meanings, one knows."
1775,FLIGHT.,Iron locks—_iron-gray locks_—a “deadlock”—
1776,FLIGHT.,That would set up an everyday wit:
1777,FLIGHT.,Then of course there’s the obvious “wedlock;”
1778,FLIGHT.,But that wasn’t it.
1779,FLIGHT.,
1780,FLIGHT.,No! mine was a joke for the ages;
1781,FLIGHT.,Full of intricate meaning and pith;
1782,FLIGHT.,A feast for your scholars and sages—
1783,FLIGHT.,How it would have rejoiced Sidney Smith!
1784,FLIGHT.,’Tis such thoughts that ennoble a mortal;
1785,FLIGHT.,"And, singing him out from the herd,"
1786,FLIGHT.,Fling wide immortality’s portal—
1787,FLIGHT.,But what was the word?
1788,FLIGHT.,
1789,FLIGHT.,Ah me! ’tis a bootless endeavour.
1790,FLIGHT.,As the flight of a bird of the air
1791,FLIGHT.,Is the flight of a joke—you will never
1792,FLIGHT.,"See the same one again, you may swear."
1793,FLIGHT.,"’Twas my firstborn, and O how I prized it!"
1794,FLIGHT.,"My darling, my treasure, my own!"
