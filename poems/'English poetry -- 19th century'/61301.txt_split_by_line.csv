331,THE RUN-OVER.,
332,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Lucky it don’t,” said the smoker, between two puffs of his cigar."
333,THE RUN-OVER.,
334,THE RUN-OVER.,"“It an’t likely to come often,” resumed Ned, “let alone the getting"
335,THE RUN-OVER.,"over it afterwards, which is the wonderfullest part of it all. To"
336,THE RUN-OVER.,"see him bowling along there, he don’t look like a man pinned to a"
337,THE RUN-OVER.,"stable-wall with the rod through him, right up to the tug--do he?”"
338,THE RUN-OVER.,
339,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Can’t say he does,” said the smoker."
340,THE RUN-OVER.,
341,THE RUN-OVER.,"“For my part,” said Ned, “or indeed any man’s part, most people in such"
342,THE RUN-OVER.,"a case would have said, it’s all up with me, and good reason why, as"
343,THE RUN-OVER.,"I said afore, with a shaft clean through your inside, right up to the"
344,THE RUN-OVER.,"tug--and two inches besides into the stable wall, by way of a benefit."
345,THE RUN-OVER.,"But somehow he always stuck to it--not the wall, you know--but his own"
346,THE RUN-OVER.,"opinion, that he should get over it--he was as firm as flints about"
347,THE RUN-OVER.,that--and sure enough the event came off exactly.”
348,THE RUN-OVER.,
349,THE RUN-OVER.,"“The better for him,” said the smoker."
350,THE RUN-OVER.,
351,THE RUN-OVER.,"“I don’t know the rights on it,” said Ned, “for I warn’t there--but"
352,THE RUN-OVER.,"they do say when he was dextricated from the rod, there was a regular"
353,THE RUN-OVER.,"tunnel through him, and in course the greatest danger was of his"
354,THE RUN-OVER.,ketching cold in the lungs from the thorough draught.”
355,THE RUN-OVER.,
356,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Nothing more likely,” said the fumigator."
357,THE RUN-OVER.,
358,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Howsomever,” continued Ned, “he was cured by Dr. Maiden of Stratford,"
359,THE RUN-OVER.,"who give him lots of physic to provoke his stomach, and make him eat"
360,THE RUN-OVER.,"hearty; and by taking his feeds well,--warm mashes at first, and then"
361,THE RUN-OVER.,"hard meat, in course of time he filled up. Nobody hardly believed it,"
362,THE RUN-OVER.,"though, when they see him about on his legs again--myself for one--but"
363,THE RUN-OVER.,"he always said he would overcome it, and he was as good as his word. If"
364,THE RUN-OVER.,"that an’t game, I don’t know what is.”"
365,THE RUN-OVER.,
366,THE RUN-OVER.,"“No more do I,” said the man with the Havannah."
367,THE RUN-OVER.,
368,THE RUN-OVER.,"“I don’t know the philosophy on it,” resumed Ned, “but it’s a remark of"
369,THE RUN-OVER.,"mine about recovering, if a man says he will, he will,--and if he says"
370,THE RUN-OVER.,"he won’t, he won’t--you may book that for certain. Mayhap a good pluck"
371,THE RUN-OVER.,"helps the wounds in healing kindly,--but so it is, for I’ve observed"
372,THE RUN-OVER.,"it. You’ll see one man with hardly a scratch on his face, and says he,"
373,THE RUN-OVER.,I’m done for--and he turns out quite correct--while another as is cut
374,THE RUN-OVER.,"to ribbons will say--never mind,--I’m good for another round, and so he"
375,THE RUN-OVER.,"proves, particularly if he’s one of your small farmers. I’ll give you a"
376,THE RUN-OVER.,reason why.”
377,THE RUN-OVER.,
378,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Now then,” said the smoker."
379,THE RUN-OVER.,
380,THE RUN-OVER.,"“My reason is,” replied Ned, “that they’re all as hard as"
381,THE RUN-OVER.,nails--regular pebbles for game. They take more thrashing than their
382,THE RUN-OVER.,"own corn, and that’s saying something. They’re all fortitude, and"
383,THE RUN-OVER.,"nothing else. Talk about punishment! nothing comes amiss to ’em, from"
384,THE RUN-OVER.,butt-ends of whips and brickbats down to bludgeons loaded with lead.
385,THE RUN-OVER.,"You can’t hurt their feelings. They’re jist like badgers, the more you"
386,THE RUN-OVER.,"welt ’em the more they grin, and when it’s over, maybe a turn-up at a"
387,THE RUN-OVER.,"cattle fair, or a stop by footpads, they’ll go home to their missises"
388,THE RUN-OVER.,"all over blood and wounds as cool and comfortable as cowcumbers,"
389,THE RUN-OVER.,with holes in their heads enough to scarify a whole hospital of army
390,THE RUN-OVER.,surgeons.”
391,THE RUN-OVER.,
392,THE RUN-OVER.,"“The very thing Scott has characterised,” I ventured to observe, “in"
393,THE RUN-OVER.,the person of honest Dandie.”
394,THE RUN-OVER.,
395,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Begging your pardon, Sir,” said Ned, “I know Farmer Scott very well,"
396,THE RUN-OVER.,"and he’s anything but a dandy. I was just a going to bring forward, as"
397,THE RUN-OVER.,"one of the trumps, a regular out-and-outer. We become friends through"
398,THE RUN-OVER.,"an axident. It was a darkish night, you see, and him a little lushy"
399,THE RUN-OVER.,"or so, making a bit of a swerve in his going towards the middle of"
400,THE RUN-OVER.,"the road, before you could cry Snacks! I was over him with the old"
401,THE RUN-OVER.,Regulator.”
402,THE RUN-OVER.,
403,THE RUN-OVER.,“Good God!” exclaimed my left-hand companion on the roof. “Was not the
404,THE RUN-OVER.,poor fellow hurt?”
405,THE RUN-OVER.,
406,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Why, not much for HIM,” answered Ned, with a very decided"
407,THE RUN-OVER.,emphasis on the pronoun. “Though it would have been a quietus for nine
408,THE RUN-OVER.,"men out of ten, and, as the Jews say, Take your pick of the basket. But"
409,THE RUN-OVER.,"he looked queer at first, and shook himself, and made a wryish face,"
410,THE RUN-OVER.,like a man that hadn’t got the exact bit of the joint he preferred.”
411,THE RUN-OVER.,
412,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Looked queer!” ejaculated the compassionate passenger, “he must have"
413,THE RUN-OVER.,"looked dreadful! I remember the Regulator, one of the oldest and"
414,THE RUN-OVER.,"heaviest vehicles on the road. But of course you picked him up, and got"
415,THE RUN-OVER.,"him inside, and----”"
416,THE RUN-OVER.,
417,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Quite the reverse,” answered Ned, quietly, “and far from it; he picked"
418,THE RUN-OVER.,"himself up, quite independent, and wouldn’t even accept a lift on the"
419,THE RUN-OVER.,"box. He only felt about his head a bit, and then his back, and his"
420,THE RUN-OVER.,"arms, and his thighs, and his lines, and after that he guv a nod, and"
421,THE RUN-OVER.,"says he, ‘all right,’ and away he toddled.”"
422,THE RUN-OVER.,
423,THE RUN-OVER.,"“I can’t credit it,” exclaimed the man on the roof."
424,THE RUN-OVER.,
425,THE RUN-OVER.,"“That’s jist what his wife said,” replied Ned, with considerable"
426,THE RUN-OVER.,"composure, in spite of the slur on his veracity. “Let alone two black"
427,THE RUN-OVER.,"eyes, and his collar bone, and the broke rib, he’d a hole in his head,"
428,THE RUN-OVER.,with a flint sticking in it bigger than any one you can find since
429,THE RUN-OVER.,"Macadaming. But he made so light on it all, and not being very clear"
430,THE RUN-OVER.,"besides in his notions, I’m blest if he didn’t tell her he’d only been"
431,THE RUN-OVER.,knockt down by a man with a truck!”
432,THE RUN-OVER.,
433,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Not a bad story,” said the smoker on the box."
434,THE RUN-OVER.,
435,THE RUN-OVER.,I confess I made internally a parallel remark. Naturally robust as my
436,THE RUN-OVER.,"faith is, I could not, as Hamlet says, let “Belief lay hold of me,”"
437,THE RUN-OVER.,"with the coachman’s narrative in his hand, like a copy of a writ. I am"
438,THE RUN-OVER.,"no stranger, indeed, to the peculiar hardihood of our native yeomanry;"
439,THE RUN-OVER.,"but Ned, in his zeal for their credit, had certainly overdrawn the"
440,THE RUN-OVER.,"truth. As to his doctrine of presentiments, it had never been one of"
441,THE RUN-OVER.,"the subjects of my speculations; but on a superficial view, it appeared"
442,THE RUN-OVER.,"to me improbable that life or death, in cases of casualty, could be"
443,THE RUN-OVER.,predetermined with such certainty as he had averred; and particularly
444,THE RUN-OVER.,"as I happen to know a certain lady, who has been accepting the Bills"
445,THE RUN-OVER.,"of Mortality at two months’ date, for many years past--but has never"
446,THE RUN-OVER.,"honoured them when due. It was fated, however, that honest Ned was to"
447,THE RUN-OVER.,be confirmed in his theories and corroborated in his facts.
448,THE RUN-OVER.,
449,THE RUN-OVER.,"We had scarcely trotted half a mile in meditative silence, when we"
450,THE RUN-OVER.,"overtook a sturdy pedestrian, who was pacing the breadth as well as"
451,THE RUN-OVER.,"the length of the road, rather more like a land surveyor than a mere"
452,THE RUN-OVER.,"traveller. He evidently belonged to the agricultural class, which"
453,THE RUN-OVER.,Ned had distinguished by the title of Small Farmers. Like Scott’s
454,THE RUN-OVER.,"Liddesdale yeoman, he wore a shaggy dreadnought, below which you saw"
455,THE RUN-OVER.,"two well-fatted calves, penned in a pair of huge top-boots--the tops"
456,THE RUN-OVER.,and the boots being of such different shades of brown as you may
457,THE RUN-OVER.,"observe in two arable fields of various soil, a rich loam and a clay."
458,THE RUN-OVER.,"In his hand he carried a formidable knotted club-stick, and a member of"
459,THE RUN-OVER.,the Heralds’ College would have set him down at once a tenant of the
460,THE RUN-OVER.,"Earl of Leicester, he looked so like a bear with a ragged staff."
461,THE RUN-OVER.,
462,THE RUN-OVER.,"I observed that Ned seemed anxious. One of his leaders was a bolter,"
463,THE RUN-OVER.,and his wheelers were far from steady; and the man ahead walked not
464,THE RUN-OVER.,quite so straightly as if he had been ploughing a furrow. We were
465,THE RUN-OVER.,"almost upon him--Ned gave a sharp halloo--the man looked back, and"
466,THE RUN-OVER.,"wavered. A minute decided the matter. He escaped Scylla, but Charybdis"
467,THE RUN-OVER.,"yawned for him--in plain prose, he cleared the Rocket, but contrived to"
468,THE RUN-OVER.,"get under the broad wheel of a Warwickshire waggon, which was passing"
469,THE RUN-OVER.,"in the opposite direction. There was still a chance,--even a fly-waggon"
470,THE RUN-OVER.,"may be stopped without much notice--but the waggoner was inside,"
471,THE RUN-OVER.,sweethearting with three maids that were going to Coventry. Every voice
472,THE RUN-OVER.,cried out Woh! but the right one. The horses plodded on--the wheels
473,THE RUN-OVER.,rumbled--the bells jingled--we all thought a knell.
474,THE RUN-OVER.,
475,THE RUN-OVER.,"Ned instantly pulled up, with his team upon their haunches--we all"
476,THE RUN-OVER.,"alighted, and in a moment the sixteen the Rocket was licensed to"
477,THE RUN-OVER.,"carry were at the fatal spot. In the midst of the circle lay, what we"
478,THE RUN-OVER.,considered a bundle of last linen just come home from the mangle.
479,THE RUN-OVER.,
480,THE RUN-OVER.,"“That’s a dead un,” said the smoker, throwing away as he spoke the"
481,THE RUN-OVER.,butt-end of a cigar.
482,THE RUN-OVER.,
483,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Poor wretch,” exclaimed the humane man from the roof, “what a shocking"
484,THE RUN-OVER.,spectacle!”
485,THE RUN-OVER.,
486,THE RUN-OVER.,"“It’s over his chest,” said I."
487,THE RUN-OVER.,
488,THE RUN-OVER.,"“It’s all over,” said the passenger on my right."
489,THE RUN-OVER.,
490,THE RUN-OVER.,"“And a happy release,” said a lady on my left; “he must have been a"
491,THE RUN-OVER.,cripple for life.”
492,THE RUN-OVER.,
493,THE RUN-OVER.,"“He can’t have a whole rib in his body,” said a man from the dicky."
494,THE RUN-OVER.,
495,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Hall to hattums,” said a gentleman from the inside."
496,THE RUN-OVER.,
497,THE RUN-OVER.,"“The worst I ever see, and I’ve had the good luck to see many,” said"
498,THE RUN-OVER.,the guard.
499,THE RUN-OVER.,
500,THE RUN-OVER.,"“No, he can’t get over that,” said Ned himself."
501,THE RUN-OVER.,
502,THE RUN-OVER.,"To our astonishment, however, the human mass still breathed. After"
503,THE RUN-OVER.,a long sigh it opened one eye--the right--then the other--the mouth
504,THE RUN-OVER.,"gasped--the tongue moved--and at last even spoke, though in disjointed"
505,THE RUN-OVER.,syllables.
506,THE RUN-OVER.,
507,THE RUN-OVER.,“We’re nigh--hand--an’t we--the nine--milestun?”
508,THE RUN-OVER.,
509,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Yes--yes--close to it,” answered a dozen voices, and one in its"
510,THE RUN-OVER.,"bewilderment asked, “Do you live there?” but was set right by the"
511,THE RUN-OVER.,sufferer himself.
512,THE RUN-OVER.,
513,THE RUN-OVER.,“No--a mile fudder.”
514,THE RUN-OVER.,
515,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Where is there a surgeon?” asked the humane man, “I will ride off for"
516,THE RUN-OVER.,him on one of the leaders.”
517,THE RUN-OVER.,
518,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Better not,” said the phlegmatic smoker, who had lighted a fresh cigar"
519,THE RUN-OVER.,with some German tinder and a lucifer--“not used to saddle--may want a
520,THE RUN-OVER.,surgeon yourself.”
521,THE RUN-OVER.,
522,THE RUN-OVER.,“Is there never a doctor among the company?” inquired the guard.
523,THE RUN-OVER.,
524,THE RUN-OVER.,"“I am a medical man,” replied a squat vulgar-looking personage. “I sell"
525,THE RUN-OVER.,Morison’s pills--but I haven’t any about me.”
526,THE RUN-OVER.,
527,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Glad of it,” said the smoker, casting a long puff in the other’s face."
528,THE RUN-OVER.,
529,THE RUN-OVER.,[Illustration: “THIS IS THE TIME WHEN CHURCH-YARDS YAWN.”]
530,THE RUN-OVER.,
531,THE RUN-OVER.,“Poor wretch!” sighed the compassionate man. “He is beyond human aid.
532,THE RUN-OVER.,Heaven help the widow and the fatherless--he looks like a family man!”
533,THE RUN-OVER.,
534,THE RUN-OVER.,"“I were not to blaame,” said the waggoner. “The woife and childerin"
535,THE RUN-OVER.,can’t coom upon I.”
536,THE RUN-OVER.,
537,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Does anyone know who he is?” inquired the coachman, but there was no"
538,THE RUN-OVER.,answer.
539,THE RUN-OVER.,
540,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Maybe the gemman has a card or summut,” said the gentleman from the"
541,THE RUN-OVER.,inside.
542,THE RUN-OVER.,
543,THE RUN-OVER.,“Is there no house near?” inquired the lady.
544,THE RUN-OVER.,
545,THE RUN-OVER.,"“For to get a shutter off on,” added the gentleman."
546,THE RUN-OVER.,
547,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Ought we not to procure a postchaise,” inquired a gentleman’s footman."
548,THE RUN-OVER.,
549,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Or a shell, in case,” suggested the man from the dicky."
550,THE RUN-OVER.,
551,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Shell be hanged!” said the sufferer, in a tone that made us all jump"
552,THE RUN-OVER.,"a yard backward. “Stick me up agin the milestun--there, easy does"
553,THE RUN-OVER.,"it--that’s comfortable--and now tell me, and no nonsense,--be I flat?”"
554,THE RUN-OVER.,
555,THE RUN-OVER.,"“A little pancakey,” said the man with the cigar."
556,THE RUN-OVER.,
557,THE RUN-OVER.,"“I say,” repeated the sufferer, with some earnestness, “be I"
558,THE RUN-OVER.,flat--quite flat--as flat like as a sheet of paper? Yes or no?”
559,THE RUN-OVER.,
560,THE RUN-OVER.,"“No, no, no,” burst from sixteen voices at once, and the assurance"
561,THE RUN-OVER.,seemed to take as great a load off his mind as had lately passed
562,THE RUN-OVER.,over his body. By an effort he contrived to get up and sit upon the
563,THE RUN-OVER.,"milestone, from which he waved us a good-bye, accompanied by the"
564,THE RUN-OVER.,following words:--
565,THE RUN-OVER.,
566,THE RUN-OVER.,"“Gentlefolk, my best thanks and my sarvice to you, and a pleasant"
567,THE RUN-OVER.,"journey. Don’t consarn yourselves about me, for there’s nothing"
568,THE RUN-OVER.,"dangerous. I shall do well, I know I shall; and I’ll tell you what I’ll"
569,THE RUN-OVER.,go upon--if I bean’t flat I shall get round.”

636,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"_Lichfield, October 1, 1833._"
637,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,
638,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"“Do you really believe, Dr. Johnson,” said a Lichfield lady, “in the"
639,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"dead walking after death?”--“Madam,” said Johnson, “I have no doubt"
640,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,on the subject; I have heard the Dead March in Saul.” “You really
641,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"believe then, Doctor, in ghosts?”--“Madam,” said Johnson, “I think"
642,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,_appearances_ are in their favour.”
643,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,
644,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,The Doctor was notoriously very superstitious. The same lady once
645,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,asked him--“if he ever felt any presentiment at a winding-sheet in the
646,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"candle.”--“Madam,” said Johnson, “if a _mould_ candle, it doubtless"
647,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"indicates death, and that somebody will go out like a _snuff_; but"
648,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"whether at Hampton _Wick_ or in _Greece_, must depend upon the"
649,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,_graves_.”
650,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,
651,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"Dr. Johnson was not comfortable in the Hebrides. “Pray, Doctor, how did"
652,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"you sleep?” inquired a benevolent Scotch hostess, who was so extremely"
653,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"hospitable that some hundreds always occupied the same bed.--“Madam,”"
654,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"said Johnson, “I had not a wink the whole night long; sleep seemed to"
655,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"_flee_ from my eyelids, and to _bug_ from all the rest of my body.”"
656,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,
657,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"The Doctor and Boswell once lost themselves in the Isle of Muck, and"
658,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,the latter said they must “_spier_ their way at the first body they
659,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"met.” “Sir,” said Dr. Johnson, “you’re a scoundrel: you may spear"
660,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"anybody you like, but I am not going to ‘run a-Muck and tilt at all I"
661,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,meet.’”

663,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,[Illustration: AN ILLUMINATED MS.]
664,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,
665,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"“What do you think of whiskey, Dr. Johnson?” hiccupped Boswell after"
666,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"emptying a sixth tumbler of toddy. “Sir,” said the Doctor, “it"
667,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"penetrates my very soul like ‘the _small-still_ voice of conscience,’"
668,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,and doubtless the worm of the still is the ‘worm that never dies.’”
669,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,Boswell afterwards inquired the Doctor’s opinion on illicit
670,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"distillation, and how the great moralist would act in an affray between"
671,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"the smugglers and the Excise. “If I went by the _letter_ of the law, I"
672,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"should assist the Customs, but according to the _spirit_ I should stand"
673,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,by the contrabands.”
674,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,
675,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,The Doctor was always very satirical on the want of timber in the
676,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"North. “Sir,” he said to the young Laird of Icombally, who was going"
677,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"to join his regiment, “may Providence preserve you in battle, and"
678,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"especially your nether limbs. You may grow a walking-stick here, but"
679,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,you must import a wooden leg.” At Dunsinane the old prejudice broke
680,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"out. “Sir,” said he to Boswell, “Macbeth was an idiot; he ought to have"
681,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,known that every wood in Scotland might be carried in a man’s hand. The
682,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"Scotch, Sir, are like the frogs in the fable: if they had a Log they"
683,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,would make a King of it.”
684,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,
685,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,Boswell one day expatiated at some length on the moral and religious
686,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"character of his countrymen, and remarked triumphantly that there was"
687,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"a Cathedral at Kirkwall, and the remains of a Bishop’s Palace. “Sir,”"
688,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"said Johnson, “it must have been the poorest of Sees: take your _Rum_"
689,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"and _Egg_ and _Mull_ altogether, and they won’t provide for a _Bishop_.”"
690,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,
691,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,East India company is the worst of all company. A Lady fresh from
692,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,Calcutta once endeavoured to curry Johnson’s favour by talking of
693,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"nothing but howdahs, doolies, and bungalows, till the Doctor took, as"
694,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"usual, to _tiffin_. “Madam,” said he, in a tone that would have scared"
695,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"a tiger out of a jungle, “India’s very well for a rubber or for a"
696,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"bandana, or for a cake of ink, but what with its Bhurtpore, Pahlumpore,"
697,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"Barrackpore, Hyderapore, Singapore, and Nagpore, its Hyderabad,"
698,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"Astrabad, Bundlebad, Sindbad, and Guzzaratbadbad, it’s a _poor_ and"
699,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,_bad_ country altogether.”
700,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,
701,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"Master M., after plaguing Miss Seward and Dr. Darwin, and a large tea"
702,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"party at Lichfield, said to his mother that he would be good if she"
703,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"would give him an apple. “My dear child,” said the parent, feeling"
704,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"herself in the presence of a great moralist, “you ought not to be good"
705,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"on any consideration of gain, for ‘virtue is its own reward.’ You ought"
706,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"to be good disinterestedly, and without thinking what you are to get"
707,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"for it.” “Madam,” said Dr. Johnson, “you are a fool; would you have the"
708,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,boy _good for nothing_?”
709,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,
710,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,The same lady once consulted the Doctor on the degree of turpitude to
711,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"be attached to her son’s robbing an orchard. “Madam,” said Johnson,"
712,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,“it all depends upon the weight of the boy. I remember my schoolfellow
713,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"Davy Garrick, who was always a little fellow, robbing a dozen of"
714,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"orchards with impunity, but the very first time I climbed up an apple"
715,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"tree, for I was always a heavy boy, the bough broke with me, and it was"
716,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,called a judgment. I suppose that’s why Justice is represented with a
717,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,pair of scales.”
718,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,
719,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"Caleb Whitefoord, the famous punster, once inquired seriously of"
720,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,Dr. Johnson whether he really considered that a man ought to be
721,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"transported, like Barrington, the pickpocket, for being guilty of a"
722,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,"double meaning. “Sir,” said Johnson, “if a man means well, the more he"
723,SEPTIMUS REARDON.,means the better.”

733,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"IT was on the evening of the 7th of November, 18--, that I went by"
734,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"invitation to sup with my friend P., at his house in Highstreet,"
735,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"Mary-le-bone. The only other person present was a Portuguese, by"
736,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"name Senor Mendez, P.’s mercantile agent at Lisbon, a person of"
737,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"remarkably retentive memory, and most wonderful power of description."
738,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,The conversation somehow turned upon the memorable great earthquake
739,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"at Lisbon, in the year of our Lord----, and Senor Mendez, who was"
740,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"residing at that time in the Portuguese capital, gave us a very"
741,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,lively picture--if lively it may be called--of the horrors of that
742,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,awful convulsion of nature. The picture was dreadful; the Senor’s own
743,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"house, a substantial stone mansion, was rent from attic to cellar: and"
744,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,the steeple of his parish church left impending over it at an angle
745,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,surpassing that of the famous Leaning Tower of Bologna!
746,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,
747,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"The Portuguese had a wonderfully expressive countenance, with a"
748,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,style of narration indescribably vivid; and as I listened with the
749,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"most intense interest, every dismal circumstance of the calamity"
750,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,became awfully distinct to my apprehension. I could hear the dreary
751,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"ringing of the bells, self-tolled from the rocking of the churches;"
752,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"the swaying to and fro of the steeples themselves, and the unnatural"
753,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"heavings and swellings of the Tagus, were vividly before me. As the"
754,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"agitations increased, the voice of the Senor became awfully tremulous,"
755,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"and his seat seemed literally to rock under him. I seemed palsied, and"
756,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,could see from P.’s looks that he was similarly affected. To conceal
757,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"his disorder, he kept swallowing large gulps from his rummer, and I"
758,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,followed his example.

761,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,
762,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"This was only the first shock;--the second soon followed, and, to"
763,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"use a popular expression, it made us both “shake in our shoes.”"
764,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"Terrific, however, as it was, the third was more tremendous; the order"
765,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"of nature seemed reversed; the ships in the Tagus sank to the bottom,"
766,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,and their ponderous anchors rose to the surface; volcanic fire burst
767,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"forth from the water, and water from dry ground; the air, no longer"
768,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"elastic, seemed to become a stupendous solid; swaying to and fro, and"
769,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,irresistibly battering down the fabrics of ages; hollow rumblings
770,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"and moanings as from the very centre of the world, gave warning of"
771,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"deafening explosions, which soon followed, and seemed to shake the"
772,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,very stars out of the sky. All this time the powerful features of
773,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"the Senor kept working, in frightful imitation of the convulsion he"
774,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"was describing, and the effect was horrible; I saw P. quiver like an"
775,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,aspen--there seemed no such thing as terra firma. Our chairs rocked
776,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"under us; the floor tossed and heaved; the candles wavered, the windows"
777,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"clattered, and the teaspoons rang again, as our tumblers vibrated in"
778,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,our hands.
779,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,
780,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"Senor Mendez at length concluded his narrative, and shortly took leave;"
781,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"I staid but a few minutes after him, just to make a remark on the"
782,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"appalling character of the story, and then departed myself,--little"
783,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"thinking, that any part of the late description was to be so speedily"
784,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,realised by my own experience!
785,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,
786,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"The hour being late, and the servants in bed, P. himself accompanied me"
787,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,to the door. I ought to remark here that the day had been uncommonly
788,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"serene--not a breath stirring, as was noticed on the morning of the"
789,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"great catastrophe at Lisbon; however, P. had barely closed the door,"
790,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,when a sudden and violent motion of the earth threw me from the step
791,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"on which I was standing, to the middle of the pavement; I had got"
792,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"partly up when a second shock, as smart as the first, threw me again"
793,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,on the ground. With some difficulty I recovered my legs a second
794,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"time, the earth in the mean time heaving about under me like the deck"
795,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"of a ship at sea. The street lamps, too, seemed violently agitated,"
796,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,and the houses nodded over me as if they would fall every instant.
797,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"I attempted to run, but it was impossible; I could barely keep on"
798,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,my feet. At one step I was dashed forcibly against the wall; at the
799,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,next I was thrown into the road; as the motion became more violent
800,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"I clung to a lamp-post, but it swayed with me like a rush. A great"
801,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"mist came suddenly on, but I could perceive people hurrying about,"
802,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"all staggering like drunken men; some of them addressing me, but so"
803,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,confusedly as to be quite unintelligible; one--a lady--passed close to
804,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"me in evident alarm: seizing her hand, I besought her to fly with me"
805,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"from the falling houses, into the open fields; what answer she made I"
806,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"know not, for at that instant, a fresh shock threw me on my face with"
807,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"such violence as to render me quite insensible. Providentially, in this"
808,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"state I attracted the notice of some of the night police, who humanely"
809,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"deposited me, for safety, in St. Anne’s watch-house, till the following"
810,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,morning; when being sufficiently recovered to give a collected account
811,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,"of that eventful evening, the ingenious Mr. W., of the Morning Herald,"
812,THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AT MARY-LE-BONE.,was so much interested by my narrative that he kindly did me the favour

980,A TRUE STORY.,"village, I forget the name, in Fife. After all the rest had sunk in"
981,A TRUE STORY.,"the waters, the huge figure of Jock was observed clinging to an oar,"
982,A TRUE STORY.,"barely afloat,--when some sufferer probably catching hold of his feet,"
983,A TRUE STORY.,"he suddenly disappeared, still grasping the oar, which afterwards"
984,A TRUE STORY.,"springing upright into the air, as it rose again to the surface, showed"
985,A TRUE STORY.,the fearful depth to which it had been carried. The body of Jock was
986,A TRUE STORY.,"the last found; about the fifth day, it was strangely enough deposited"
987,A TRUE STORY.,"by the tide almost at the threshold of his own dwelling, at the Craig,"
988,A TRUE STORY.,"a small pier or jetty, frequented by the ferry-boats. It had been"
989,A TRUE STORY.,"hastily caught up, and in its clothes laid out in the manner just"
990,A TRUE STORY.,"described, lying as it were in state, and the public, myself one, being"
991,A TRUE STORY.,"freely admitted, as far as the room would hold, it was crowded by"
992,A TRUE STORY.,"fish-wives, mariners, and other shore-haunters, except a few feet next"
993,A TRUE STORY.,"the corpse, which a natural awe towards the dead kept always vacant."
994,A TRUE STORY.,The narrow death’s door was crammed with eager listening and looking
995,A TRUE STORY.,"heads, and by the buzzing without, there was a large surplus crowd in"
996,A TRUE STORY.,waiting before the dwelling for their turn to enter it.
997,A TRUE STORY.,
998,A TRUE STORY.,"On a sudden, at a startling exclamation from one of those nearest"
999,A TRUE STORY.,"the bed, all eyes were directed towards that quarter. One of the"
1000,A TRUE STORY.,"candles was guttering and sputtering near the socket,--the other just"
1001,A TRUE STORY.,"twinkling out, and sending up a stream of rank smoke,--but by the"
1002,A TRUE STORY.,"light, dim as it was, a slight motion of the sheet was perceptible"
1003,A TRUE STORY.,just at that part where the hand of the dead mariner might be supposed
1004,A TRUE STORY.,to be lying at his side! A scream and shout of horror burst from all
1005,A TRUE STORY.,"within, echoed, though ignorant of the cause, by another from the"
1006,A TRUE STORY.,"crowd without. A general rush was made towards the door, but egress"
1007,A TRUE STORY.,was impossible. Nevertheless horror and dread squeezed up the company
1008,A TRUE STORY.,in the room to half their former compass: and left a far wider blank
1009,A TRUE STORY.,between the living and the dead! I confess at first I mistrusted my
1010,A TRUE STORY.,"sight; it seemed that some twitching of the nerves of the eye, or"
1011,A TRUE STORY.,"the flickering of the shadows, thrown by the unsteady flame of the"
1012,A TRUE STORY.,"candle, might have caused some optical delusion; but after several"
1013,A TRUE STORY.,"minutes of sepulchral silence and watching, the motion became more"
1014,A TRUE STORY.,"awfully manifest, now proceeding slowly upwards, as if the hand of the"
1015,A TRUE STORY.,"deceased, still beneath the sheet, was struggling up feebly towards"
1016,A TRUE STORY.,"his head. It is possible to conceive, but not to describe, the popular"
1017,A TRUE STORY.,"consternation,--the shrieks of women,--the shouts of men--the struggles"
1018,A TRUE STORY.,"to gain the only outlet, choked up and rendered impassable by the very"
1019,A TRUE STORY.,"efforts of desperation and fear!--Clinging to each other, and with"
1020,A TRUE STORY.,"ghastly faces that _dared_ not turn from the object of dread, the"
1021,A TRUE STORY.,"whole assembly backed with united force against the opposite wall,"
1022,A TRUE STORY.,with a convulsive energy that threatened to force out the very side
1023,A TRUE STORY.,"of the dwelling--when, startled before by silent motion, but now by"
1024,A TRUE STORY.,"sound,--with a smart rattle something fell from the bed to the floor,"
1025,A TRUE STORY.,"and disentangling itself from the death drapery, displayed--a large"
1026,A TRUE STORY.,"pound Crab!--The creature, with some design, perhaps sinister, had"
1027,A TRUE STORY.,"been secreted in the ample clothes of the drowned seaman, but even"
1028,A TRUE STORY.,the comparative insignificance of this apparition gave but little
1029,A TRUE STORY.,"alleviation to the superstitious horrors of the spectators, who"
1030,A TRUE STORY.,"appeared to believe firmly, that it was only the Evil One himself,"
1031,A TRUE STORY.,"transfigured.--Wherever the crab straddled sidelong, infirm beldame"
1032,A TRUE STORY.,"and sturdy boatman equally shrank and retreated before it,--aye, even"
1033,A TRUE STORY.,"as it changed place, to crowding closely round the corpse itself,"
1034,A TRUE STORY.,"rather than endure its diabolical contact. The crowd outside, warned"
1035,A TRUE STORY.,"by cries from within, of the presence of Mahound, had by this time"
1036,A TRUE STORY.,"retired to a respectful distance, and the crab, doing what herculean"
1037,A TRUE STORY.,"sinews had failed to effect, cleared itself a free passage through"
1038,A TRUE STORY.,"the door in a twinkling, and with natural instinct began crawling as"
1039,A TRUE STORY.,"fast as he could clapperclaw, down the little jetty before mentioned"
1040,A TRUE STORY.,"that led into his native sea. The Satanic Spirit, however disguised,"
1041,A TRUE STORY.,seemed everywhere distinctly recognised. Many at the lower end of the
1042,A TRUE STORY.,"Craig lept into their craft; one or two even into the water, whilst"
1043,A TRUE STORY.,"others crept as close to the verge of the pier as they could, leaving"
1044,A TRUE STORY.,"a thoroughfare--wide as “the broad path of honour,”--to the Infernal"
1045,A TRUE STORY.,"Cancer. To do him justice, he straddled along with a very unaffected"
1046,A TRUE STORY.,unconsciousness of his own evil importance. He seemed to have no aim
1047,A TRUE STORY.,"higher than salt water and sand, and had accomplished half the distance"
1048,A TRUE STORY.,"towards them, when a little decrepit poor old sea-roamer, generally"
1049,A TRUE STORY.,"known as “Creel Katie,” made a dexterous snatch at a hind claw, and"
1050,A TRUE STORY.,"before the Crab-Devil was aware, deposited him in her patchwork"
1051,A TRUE STORY.,"apron, with an “Hech, Sirs, what for are ye gaun to let gang siccan a"
1052,A TRUE STORY.,"braw partane?” In vain a hundred voices shouted out, “Let him bide,"
1053,A TRUE STORY.,"Katie,--he’s no cannie;” fish or fiend, the resolute old dame kept a"
1054,A TRUE STORY.,"fast clutch of her prize, promising him, moreover, a comfortable simmer"
1055,A TRUE STORY.,"in the mickle pat, for the benefit of herself and that “puir silly body"
1056,A TRUE STORY.,the gudeman:” and she kept her word. Before night the poor Devil was
1057,A TRUE STORY.,"dressed in his shell, to the infinite horror of all her neighbours."
1058,A TRUE STORY.,"Some even said that a black figure, with horns, and wings, and hoofs,"
1059,A TRUE STORY.,"and forky tail, in fact old Clooty himself, had been seen to fly out"
1060,A TRUE STORY.,"of the chimney. Others said that unwholesome and unearthly smells, as"
1061,A TRUE STORY.,"of pitch and brimstone, had reeked forth from the abominable thing,"
1062,A TRUE STORY.,"through door and window. Creel Kate, however, persisted, aye, even to"
1063,A TRUE STORY.,"her dying day and on her deathbed, that the Crab was as sweet a Crab"
1064,A TRUE STORY.,as ever was supped on; and that it recovered her old husband out of a
1065,A TRUE STORY.,"very poor low way,--adding, “And that was a thing, ye ken, the Deil a"

1262,A SNAKE-SNACK.,
1263,A SNAKE-SNACK.,
1264,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"IT was my good fortune once, at Charing Cross, to witness the feeding"
1265,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"of the Boa Constrictor; rather a rare occurrence, and difficult of"
1266,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"observation, the reptile not being remarkable for the regularity of"
1267,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"its dinner-hour; and a very considerable interval intervenes, as the"
1268,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"world knows, between Gorge the First, and Gorge the Second, Gorge the"
1269,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"Third, and Gorge the Fourth. I was not in time to see the serpent’s"
1270,A SNAKE-SNACK.,first dart at the prey; she had already twisted herself round her
1271,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"victim,--a living White Rabbit--who with a large dark eye gazed"
1272,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"piteously through one of the folds, and looked most eloquently that"

1278,A SNAKE-SNACK.,
1279,A SNAKE-SNACK.,The Snake evidently only embraced him in a kill-him-when-I-want-him
1280,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"manner, just firmly enough to prevent an escape--but her lips were"
1281,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"glued on his, in a close “Judas’ kiss.” So long a time elapsed, in"
1282,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"this position, both as marble-still as poor old Laocoon with his"
1283,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"leaches on, that I really began to doubt the tale of the Boa’s ability"
1284,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"in swallowing; and to associate the hoax before me, with that of the"
1285,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"Bottle Conjuror. The head of the snake, in fact, might have gone"
1286,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"without difficulty into a wine-glass, and the throat, down which the"
1287,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"rabbit was to proceed whole, seemed not at all thicker than my thumb."
1288,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"In short, I thought the reported _cram_ was nothing but _stuff_,"
1289,A SNAKE-SNACK.,and the only other visitor declared himself of my opinion: “If that
1290,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"’ere little wiper swallows up the rabbit, I’ll bolt um both!” and he"
1291,A SNAKE-SNACK.,seemed capable of the feat. He looked like a personification of what
1292,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"Political Economists call the Public Consumer; or, Geoffrey Crayon’s"
1293,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"Stout Gentleman, seen through Carpenter’s Solar Microscope; a genuine"

1295,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"wagers: the delight of eating-houses, and the dread of ordinaries. The"
1296,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"contrast was whimsical, between his mountain of mummy, and the slim"
1297,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"Macaroni figure of the Snake, the reputed Glutton. However, the Boa"
1298,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"began at last to prepare for the meal, by lubricating the muzzle of the"
1299,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"Rabbit with her slimy tongue, and then commenced in earnest,"
1300,A SNAKE-SNACK.,
1301,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"As far as in her lay to take him in,"
1302,A SNAKE-SNACK.,A stranger dying with so fair a skin.
1303,A SNAKE-SNACK.,
1304,A SNAKE-SNACK.,The process was tedious--“one swallow makes a summer”--but it gradually
1305,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"became apparent, from the fate of the head, that the whole body might"
1306,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"eventually be “lost in the Serpentine.” The Reptile, indeed, made ready"
1307,A SNAKE-SNACK.,for the rest of the interment by an operation rather horrible. On a
1308,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"sudden, the living cable was observed, as a sailor would say, to haul"
1309,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"in her slack, and with a squeeze evincing tremendous muscular power,"
1310,A SNAKE-SNACK.,she reduced the whole body into a compass that would follow the head
1311,A SNAKE-SNACK.,with perfect ease. It was like a regular smash in business:--the poor
1312,A SNAKE-SNACK.,rabbit was completely broken--and the wily winder-up of his affairs
1313,A SNAKE-SNACK.,recommenced paying herself in full. It was a sorry sight and sickening.
1314,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"As for the Stout Gentleman, he could not control his agitation. His"
1315,A SNAKE-SNACK.,eyes rolled and watered; his jaws constantly yawned like a panther’s;
1316,A SNAKE-SNACK.,and his hands with a convulsive movement were clasped every now and
1317,A SNAKE-SNACK.,then on his stomach;--but when the whole rabbit was smothered in
1318,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"snake, he could restrain himself no longer, and rushed out of the"

1320,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"rash engagement. Anxious to ascertain the true nature of the impulse,"
1321,A SNAKE-SNACK.,"I hurried in pursuit of him, and after a short but sharp chase, I saw"

1359,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"With Miss Crachami--dwarfish quite in stature,"

1361,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,His face of marvellously pleasant feature.
1362,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,So short and sweet a man was never seen--
1363,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,All thought him charming at the first beginning--
1364,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Alas, ere long they found him far too winning!"
1365,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1366,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,He seem’d in love with chance--and chance repaid
1367,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"His ardent passion with her fondest smile,"
1368,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"The sunshine of good luck, without a shade,"
1369,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,He staked and won--and won and staked--the bile

1371,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,To see at every venture how that vile
1372,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Small gambler snatch’d--and how he won them too--

1377,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Miss Wiggins set her heart upon a box,"

1379,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And dreamt three times she garnish’d it with stocks,"
1380,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Of needles, silks, and cottons--but alas!"
1381,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,She lost it wide awake.--We thought Miss Cox
1382,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Was lucky--but she saw three caddies pass
1383,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,To that small imp:--no living luck could loo him!
1384,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Sir Stamford would have lost his Raffles to him!
1385,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1386,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And so he climb’d--and rode, and won--and walk’d,"
1387,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,The wondrous topic of the curious swarm
1388,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,That haunted the Parade. Many were balk’d
1389,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Of notoriety by that small form
1390,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Pacing it up and down:--some even talk’d
1391,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Of ducking him--when lo! a dismal storm
1392,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Stepp’d in--one Friday, at the close of day--"
1393,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,And every head was turn’d another way--
1394,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1395,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Watching the grander guest. It seem’d to rise
1396,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Bulky and slow upon the southern brink
1397,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Of the horizon--fann’d by sultry sighs--
1398,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"So black and threatening, I cannot think"

1400,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Miss Wiggins sometime _shades_ in Indian ink--
1401,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"_Miss_-shapen blotches of such heavy vapour,"

1403,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1404,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"As for the sea, it did not fret, and rave,"
1405,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And tear its waves to tatters, and so dash on"
1406,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,The stony-hearted beach;--some bards would have
1407,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"It always rampant, in that idle fashion,--"
1408,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Whereas the waves roll’d in, subdued and grave,"
1409,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Like schoolboys, when the master’s in a passion,"

1411,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,With a very quiet awe on all their faces.
1412,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1413,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Some love to draw the ocean with a head,"

1416,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Surged in scarce rougher than a lady’s flounce:--
1417,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"But then, a grander contrast thus it bred"
1418,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"With the wild welkin, seeming to pronounce"

1420,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,As one would whisper that a lion’s near--
1421,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1422,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Who just begins to roar; so the hoarse thunder
1423,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Growl’d long--but low--a prelude note of death,"
1424,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"As if the stifling clouds yet kept it under,"
1425,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,But still it mutter’d to the sea beneath
1426,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Such a continued peal, as made us wonder"
1427,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"It did not pause more oft to take its breath,"
1428,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Whilst we were panting with the sultry weather,"
1429,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And hardly cared to wed two words together,"
1430,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1431,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"But watch’d the surly advent of the storm,"
1432,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Much as the brown-cheek’d planters of Barbadoes
1433,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Must watch a rising of the Negro swarm:--
1434,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Meantime it steer’d, like Odin’s old Armadas,"
1435,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Right on our coast;--a dismal, coal-black form;--"
1436,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Many proud gaits were quell’d--and all bravadoes
1437,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Of folly ceased--and sundry idle jokers
1438,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Went home to cover up their tongs and pokers.
1439,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1440,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,So fierce the lightning flashed. In all their days
1441,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"The oldest smugglers had not seen such flashing,"
1442,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And they are used to many a pretty blaze,"
1443,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,To keep their Hollands from an awkward clashing
1444,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,With hostile cutters in our creeks and bays:--
1445,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,And truly one could think without much lashing
1446,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"The fancy, that those coasting clouds so awful"
1447,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And black, were fraught with spirits as unlawful."
1448,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1449,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,The gay Parade grew thin--all the fair crowd
1450,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Vanish’d--as if they knew their own attractions,--"
1451,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,For now the lightning through a near hand cloud
1452,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Began to make some very crooked fractions--
1453,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Only some few remain’d that were not cow’d,"
1454,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"A few rough sailors, who had been in actions,"
1455,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And sundry boatmen, that with quick yeo’s,"
1456,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Lest it should _blow_,--were pulling up the _Rose_:"
1457,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1458,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"(No flower, but a boat)--some more hauling"
1459,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,The _Regent_ by the head:--another crew
1460,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,With that same cry peculiar to their _calling_--
1461,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Were heaving up the _Hope_:--and as they knew
1462,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,The very gods themselves oft get a mauling
1463,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"In their own realms, the seamen wisely drew"
1464,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"The _Neptune_ rather higher on the beach,"
1465,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,That he might lie beyond his billows’ reach.
1466,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1467,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And now the storm, with its despotic power"
1468,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Had all usurp’d the azure of the skies,"
1469,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Making our daylight darker by an hour,"
1470,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,And some few drops--of an unusual size--
1471,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Few and distinct--scarce twenty to the shower,"
1472,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Fell like huge tear-drops from a Giant’s eyes--
1473,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,But then this sprinkle thicken’d in a trice
1474,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,And rain’d much _harder_--in good solid ice.
1475,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1476,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Oh! for a very storm of words to show
1477,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,How this fierce crash of hail came rushing o’er us!
1478,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Handel would make the gusty organs blow
1479,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Grandly, and a rich storm in music score us!--"
1480,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"But ev’n his music seem’d composed and low,"
1481,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,When we were _handled_ by this Hailstone Chorus;
1482,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Whilst thunder rumbled, with its awful sound,"
1483,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,And frozen comfits roll’d along the ground--
1484,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1485,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,As big as bullets:--Lord! how they did batter
1486,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Our crazy tiles:--And now the lightning flash’d
1487,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Alternate with the dark, until the latter"
1488,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Was rarest of the two:--the gust too dash’d
1489,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"So terribly, I thought the hail must shatter"
1490,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Some panes,--and so it did--and first it smash’d"
1491,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,The very square where I had chose my station
1492,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,To watch the general illumination.
1493,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1494,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Another, and another, still came in,"
1495,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And fell in jingling ruin at my feet,"
1496,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Making transparent holes that let me win
1497,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Some samples of the storm:--Oh! it was sweet
1498,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"To think I had a shelter for my skin,"
1499,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Culling them through these “loopholes of retreat”--
1500,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Which in a little we began to glaze--
1501,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Chiefly with a jacktowel and some baize!
1502,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1503,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"By which, the cloud had pass’d o’erhead, but play’d"
1504,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Its crooked fires in constant flashes still,"
1505,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Just in our rear, as though it had array’d"
1506,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Its heavy batteries at Fairlight Mill,"
1507,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"So that it lit the town, and grandly made"
1508,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,The rugged features of the Castle Hill
1509,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Leap, like a birth, from chaos, into light,"
1510,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,And then relapse into the gloomy night--
1511,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1512,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"As parcel of the cloud:--the clouds themselves,"
1513,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Like monstrous crags and summits everlasting,"
1514,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Piled each on each in most gigantic shelves,"
1515,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,That Milton’s devils were engaged in blasting.--
1516,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,We could e’en fancy Satan and his elves
1517,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Busy upon those crags, and ever casting"
1518,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Huge fragments loose--and that we _felt_ the sound
1519,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,They made in falling to the startled ground.
1520,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1521,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And so the tempest scowl’d away,--and soon,"
1522,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Timidly shining through its skirts of jet,"
1523,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"We saw the rim of the pacific moon,"
1524,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Like a bright fish entangled in a net,"
1525,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Flashing its silver sides,--how sweet a boon,"
1526,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Seem’d her sweet light, as though it would beget,"
1527,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"With that fair smile, a calm upon the seas--"
1528,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Peace in the sky--and coolness in the breeze!
1529,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1530,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Meantime the hail had ceased:--and all the brood
1531,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Of glaziers stole abroad to count their gains;--
1532,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"At every window, there were maids who stood"
1533,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Lamenting o’er the glass’s small remains,--"
1534,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Or with coarse linens made the fractious good,"
1535,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Stanching the wind in all the wounded panes,--"
1536,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Or, holding candles to the panes, in doubt:"
1537,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,The wind resolved--blowing the candles out.
1538,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1539,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"No house was whole that had a southern front,--"
1540,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,No green-house but the same mishap befell:--
1541,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"_Bow_-windows and _bell_-glasses bore the brunt,--"
1542,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,No sex in glass was spared!--For those who dwell
1543,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"On each hill side, you might have swam a punt"

1554,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Howbeit his _weather eye_ the seaman aim’d

1556,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,A gale next morning--and when morning broke
1557,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,There was a gale--“quite equal to bespoke.”
1558,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1559,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Before high water--(it were better far
1560,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"To christen it not _water_ then, but _waiter_,"
1561,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,For then the tide is _serving at the bar_)
1562,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Rose such a swell--I never saw one greater!
1563,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Black, jagged billows rearing up in war"

1567,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1568,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"No open boat was open to a fare,"

1570,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,No bathing woman waded--none would dare
1571,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,A dipping in the wave--but waived their dips;
1572,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"No seagull ventured on the stormy air,"
1573,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,And all the dreary coast was clear of ships;
1574,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,For two _lea shores_ upon the river Lea
1575,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Are not so perilous as one at sea.
1576,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
1577,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Awe-struck we sat, and gazed upon the scene"

1581,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"When lo, in that vast hollow scoop’d between"
1582,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Two rolling Alps of water,--white and curly!"
1583,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"We saw a pair of little arms a-skimming,"

1586,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Sometimes a hand--sometimes a little shoe--

1713,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,teemed with blood.”
1714,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,
1715,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"“We’re all right--as right as a trivet,” said the coachman, after a"
1716,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,pause of perplexity; “I thought our notions were getting rather wide
1717,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"apart, and that one of us wanted putting straight; but I see what you"
1718,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"mean, and quite go along with your opinion, step for step. To be sure,"
1719,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,Mrs. Nelson has done the world and all for coaching; and the Wonder
1720,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"_is_ the crack of all the drags in London, and so is the Dauntless,"
1721,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"let yard turn out agin yard, as you say, any day you like. And as for"
1722,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"leaders, and teams full of blood, there’s as pretty a sprinkling of"
1723,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,blood in the tits I’m now tooling of--”
1724,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,
1725,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"“The vehicles of the proprietress, and the appearance of the animals,"
1726,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"with their corresponding caparisons,” said I, “have often gratified my"
1727,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,visual organs and elicited my mental plaudits.”
1728,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,
1729,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"“That’s exactly what _I_ says,” replied the coachman, very briskly,"
1730,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,“there’s no humbug nor no nonsense about Mrs. Nelson. You never see her
1731,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"a standing a-foaming and fretting in front o’ the Bank, with a regular"
1732,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"mob round her, and looking as if she’d bolt with the Quicksilver. And"
1733,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"you never see her painted all over her body, wherever there’s room for"
1734,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"’em, with Saracen Heads, and Blue Boars, and Brown Bears, from her"
1735,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"roller bolts to her dicky and hind boot. She’s plain and neat, and"
1736,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"nothin’ else--and is fondest of having her body of a claret colour,"
1737,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"pick’d out with white, and won’t suffer the Bull, no where, except on"
1738,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,the back-gammon board.”
1739,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,
1740,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"I know not how much further the whimsical description might have gone,"
1741,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"if a strapping, capless, curly-headed lass, running with all her might"
1742,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"and main, had not addressed a screaming retainer to the coachman. With"
1743,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"some difficulty he pulled up, for he had been tacitly giving me a proof"
1744,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"that the craft of _his_ Nelson was a first-rate, with regard to its"
1745,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,rate of travelling.
1746,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,
1747,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"“If you please, Mr. Stevens,” said the panting damsel, holding up"
1748,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"something towards the box--“if you please, Mr. Stevens, mother’s gone"
1749,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,to Lonnon--in the light cart--and will you be so kind as to give
1750,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,her--her linchpin.”
1751,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,
1752,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"Mr. Stevens took the article with a smile, and I fancied with a sly"
1753,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,squeeze of the hand that delivered it.
1754,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,
1755,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"“If such a go had been anyone’s but your mother’s, Fanny,” he slyly"
1756,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"remarked, “I should have said it was somebody in love.” The Dispatch"
1757,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"was too strictly timed to allow of further parley; the horses broke, or"
1758,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"were rather broken, into a gallop, in pursuit of the mother of Fanny,"
1759,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"the Flower of Waltham; and the pin secretly acting as a spur, we did"
1760,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,the next five mile in something like twenty minutes.
1761,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,
1762,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"In spite, however, of this unusual speed, we never overtook Mrs."
1763,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"Merryweather and her cart till we arrived at the Basing-House, where we"
1764,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,found her chirping over a cup of ale; as safe and sound as if linchpins
1765,GUIDE TO GREENWICH HOSPITAL.,"had never been invented; in fact, she made as light of the article,"

1816,"GENTLE READERS,",of continuity in my “Literary Reminiscences.” Confined to my chamber
1817,"GENTLE READERS,",by what ought to be termed _room_atism--then attacked by my old
1818,"GENTLE READERS,","livery complaint--and finally, by a minor, but troublesome malady,"
1819,"GENTLE READERS,","the Present has too much prevailed over the Past, to let me indulge"

1824,"GENTLE READERS,",theatricals--there is an anecdote on point.
1825,"GENTLE READERS,",
1826,"GENTLE READERS,","In the Olympic days of the great Elliston, there was one evening a"
1827,"GENTLE READERS,","tremendous tumult at his Theatre, in consequence of the absence of a"
1828,"GENTLE READERS,",favourite performer. One man in the pit--a Butcher--was especially
1829,"GENTLE READERS,",vociferous in his cry for “Carl! Carl! Carl!” Others called for the
1830,"GENTLE READERS,","Manager, who duly made his appearance, and black as the weather"
1831,"GENTLE READERS,","looked, he was the very sort of pilot to weather the storm. With one"
1832,"GENTLE READERS,",of his princely bows he proceeded to address the House. “Ladies
1833,"GENTLE READERS,",and Gentlemen--but by your leave I will address myself to a single
1834,"GENTLE READERS,",individual. I will ask that gentleman (pointing to the vociferous
1835,"GENTLE READERS,",Butcher) what right he has to demand the appearance of Mr. Carl?”
1836,"GENTLE READERS,",
1837,"GENTLE READERS,","“’Cos,” said the Butcher, “’cos he’s down in the Bill.” Such an"
1838,"GENTLE READERS,","undeniable answer would have staggered any other Manager than Elliston,"
1839,"GENTLE READERS,",but he was not easily to be disconcerted. “Because he is down in the
1840,"GENTLE READERS,","bill!” he echoed, in a tone of the loftiest indignation: “Ladies and"
1841,"GENTLE READERS,","Gentlemen, the Mr. Carl, so unseasonably, so vociferously and so"
1842,"GENTLE READERS,","unfeelingly called for, is at this very moment labouring under severe"
1843,"GENTLE READERS,","illness--he is in bed. And let me ask, is a man, a fellow-creature,"
1844,"GENTLE READERS,","a human being, to be torn from his couch, from his home, on a cold"
1845,"GENTLE READERS,","night, from the affectionate attentions of his wife and family, at"
1846,"GENTLE READERS,","the risk of his valuable life perhaps, to go through a fatiguing part"
1847,"GENTLE READERS,","because he happens to be DOWN IN THE BILL?” [Cries of “Shame, shame!”"
1848,"GENTLE READERS,","from all parts of the house.] “And yet, ladies and gentlemen, there"
1849,"GENTLE READERS,","stands a man--if I may call him so--a Butcher, that for his own selfish"
1850,"GENTLE READERS,",gratification--the amusement of a few short hours--would risk the very
1851,"GENTLE READERS,","existence of a deserving member of society, a good husband, father,"
1852,"GENTLE READERS,","friend, and one of your favourite actors, and all, forsooth, because"
1853,"GENTLE READERS,","he is DOWN IN THE BILL!” [Universal hooting, with cries of “Turn him"
1854,"GENTLE READERS,","out.”] “By all means,” acquiesced the Manager, with one of his best"
1855,"GENTLE READERS,",bows--and the indignant pittites actually hooted and kicked their own
1856,"GENTLE READERS,","champion out of the theatre, as something more than a Butcher, and less"
1857,"GENTLE READERS,",than a Christian.
1858,"GENTLE READERS,",
1859,"GENTLE READERS,","Now I am myself, gentle readers, in the same predicament with Mr."
1860,"GENTLE READERS,",Carl. Like him I am an invalid--and like him I am unfortunately down
1861,"GENTLE READERS,",in the Bill. It would not become me to set forth my own domestic or
1862,"GENTLE READERS,","social virtues, or to hint what sort of gap my loss would make in"
1863,"GENTLE READERS,",society--still less would it consist with modesty to compare myself
1864,"GENTLE READERS,",with a favourite actor--but as a mere human being I throw myself on
1865,"GENTLE READERS,","your mercy, and ask, in common charity, would you have had me leave"
1866,"GENTLE READERS,","my warm bed, to shiver in a printer’s damp sheets, at the risk of my"
1867,"GENTLE READERS,","reputation perhaps, and for the mere amusement of some half hour, or"
1868,"GENTLE READERS,",more probably for no amusement at all--simply because I was “_down in

1961,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,
1962,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"On Thursday evening, towards seven o’clock, I was struck by the"
1963,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,singular appearance of the moon silvering the opposite chimneys with
1964,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"a blood-red light, a lunar phenomenon, which I conceived belonged"
1965,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,only to our theatres. It speedily occurred to me that there must be
1966,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"a conflagration in my vicinity, and after a little hunting by scent"
1967,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"as well as sight, I found myself in front of the Houses of Lords"
1968,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"and Commons, which were burning with a rapidity and brilliancy that"
1969,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,I make bold to say did not always characterise their proceedings.
1970,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"By favour of my natural assurance, which seemed to identify me with"
1971,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"the firemen, I was allowed to pass through the lines of guards and"
1972,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"policemen, who surrounded the blazing pile, and was thus enabled to"
1973,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,select a favourable position for overlooking the whole scene. It was
1974,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"an imposing sight. The flames rose from the Peers’ in a volume, as red"
1975,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"as the Extraordinary Red Book, and the House of Commons was not at"
1976,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,all behind-hand in voting supplies of timber and other combustibles.
1977,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"Westminster Hall reminded me vividly of a London cry, “Hall hot, Hall"
1978,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"hot,” that was familiar in our childhood--and the Gothic architecture"
1979,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"of the Abbey seemed unusually _florid_. Instead of dingy stone, the"
1980,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,venerable pile appeared to be built of the well-baked brick of the
1981,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"Elizabethan age. Indeed, so red-hot was its aspect, that it led to a"
1982,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"ludicrous misapprehension on the part of the populace. A procession,"
1983,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"bearing several male and female figures in a state of insensibility,"
1984,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"naturally gave rise to the most painful conjectures, inferring loss of"
1985,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"human life by the devouring element, but I have reason to believe it"
1986,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,was only the Dean and Chapter saving the Wax-Work. As far as my own
1987,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"observation went, the first object carried out certainly bore a strong"
1988,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,resemblance to General Monk.
1989,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,
1990,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"In the meantime a select party had effected an entrance into the Hall,"
1991,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"but not without some serious delay, occasioned, I believe, by somebody"
1992,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"within bringing the wrong key, that belonged to a tea-caddy. However,"
1993,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"at last they entered, and I followed their example. The first person"
1994,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"I beheld was the veteran Higginbottom, so unfairly, but facetiously,"
1995,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,put to death by the authors of the Rejected Addresses; for no man is
1996,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,more alive to his duty. But he was sadly hampered. First came one
1997,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"Hon. Gent. said to be Mr. Morrison, and insisted on directing the"
1998,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"_Hose_ department; and next arrived a noble Lord from Crockford’s, who"
1999,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"wouldn’t sit out, but persisted in taking a hand, and playing, though"
2000,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"every body agreed that he played too high. I mention this, because some"
2001,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"of the journals have imputed mismanagement to the engines, and have"
2002,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"insinuated that the pipes wanted organising; indeed, I myself overheard"
2003,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,a noble director of the Academy of Music lamenting that the firemen did
2004,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,not “play in concert.”
2005,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,
2006,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,[Illustration: PLAYING AT HAZARD.]
2007,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,
2008,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,The same remark applies with greater force to the House of Commons.
2009,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"Here all was confusion worse confounded, and Higginbottom’s station"
2010,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"was enviable, compared with that of some of the poor fellows in St."
2011,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"Stephen’s Chapel. A considerable number of members had arrived, and"
2012,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"without any attention to their usual parliamentary rules, were all"
2013,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"making motions at once, which nobody seconded. The most prominent,"
2014,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"I was informed, were Mr. Hume, Mr. O’Connell, Mr. Attwood, Mr."
2015,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"Buckingham, Mr. Pease, Sir Andrew, and Mr. Buxton--the latter almost"
2016,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"covered with blacks. The clamour was terrific, and I really expected"
2017,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,that the poor foremen who held the pipes would be torn in pieces. Every
2018,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,body wanted to command the Coldstream. Nothing but shouts of “Here!
2019,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,here! here!” answered like an Irish echo by cries of “There! there!
2020,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"there!” “Oh, save my savings!”--“My poor, Poor Bill!” “More water--more"
2021,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"water for my Drunkenness!” “Work awa, lads, work awa--it’s no the"
2022,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"Sabbath, and ye may just play at what ye like!”"
2023,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,
2024,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"In pleasing contrast to this tumult, was the unusual and cordial"
2025,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"unanimity of the members of both Houses, in rescuing whatever was"
2026,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,portable from the flames. It was a delightful novelty to see the
2027,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,Lords helping the Commons in whatever they moved or carried. No party
2028,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"spirit--no Whig, pulling at one leg of the table, whilst a Tory tugged"
2029,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,at another in the opposite direction. They seemed to belong to the
2030,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,Hand-in-Hand. Peers and Commoners were alike seen burthened with loads
2031,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"of papers or furniture. Mr. Calvert, in particular, worked like any"
2032,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"porter. Of course, in rescuing the papers and parchments, there was no"
2033,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"time for inspecting their contents, and some curious results were the"
2034,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"consequence. Every body remembers the pathetic story in the Tatler,"
2035,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"of the lover who saved a strange lady from a burning theatre, under"
2036,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"the idea that he was preserving the mistress of his affections, and"
2037,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,some similar mistakes are currently reported to have occurred at the
2038,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,late conflagration--and equally to the chagrin of the parties. I go
2039,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"by hearsay, and cannot vouch for the facts, but it is said that the"
2040,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"unpopular Six Acts, including what I believe is called the Gagging"
2041,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"Act, were actually preserved by Mr. Cobbett. Mr. O’Connell saved the"
2042,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"Irish Coercion Bill, whilst the Reform Bill was snatched like “a brand"
2043,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"out of the fire,” by a certain noble Duke, who resolutely set his face"
2044,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"against it in all its stages! Amongst others, Mr. Ricardo saved an old"
2045,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"tattered flag, which he thought was “the standard of value.”"
2046,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,
2047,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,[Illustration: CRIBBAGE:--ONE FOR HIS NOB AND TWO FOR HIS HEELS.]
2048,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,
2049,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"However deficient in general combination, and concentration of"
2050,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"energies, individual efforts were beyond all praise. The instances of"
2051,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,personal exertion and daring were numerous. Mr. Rice worked amidst
2052,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,the flames till he was nearly baked; and everybody expected that Mr.
2053,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,Pease would be parched. The greatest danger was from the melted metal
2054,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,pouring down from the windows and roof. The heads of some of the Hon.
2055,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,Gentlemen were literally nothing but lead. Great apprehensions were
2056,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"entertained of the falling in of one of the walls, which eventually"
2057,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"gave way, but fortunately everybody had retreated on the timely warning"
2058,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"of a gentleman, Mr. O’Connell, I believe, who declared that he saw a"
2059,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,Rent in it.
2060,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,
2061,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"I did not enter the House of Lords, which was now one mass of glowing"
2062,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"fire, but directed my attention towards the Speaker’s mansion, which"
2063,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,was partially burning. The garden behind was nearly filled with
2064,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,miscellaneous property--and numbers of well-dressed gentlemen were
2065,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"every moment rushing into the house, from which they issued again,"
2066,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"laden with spits, sauce-pans, and other culinary implements. I, myself,"
2067,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,saw one zealous individual thus encumbered--with a stew-pan on his
2068,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"head, the meat-screen under one arm, the dripping-pan under the other,"
2069,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"the frying-pan in his right hand, the grid-iron in his left, and the"
2070,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"rolling-pin in his mouth. Indeed, it is said that every article in the"
2071,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,kitchen was saved down to the salt-box; and the cook declares that such
2072,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,was the anxiety to save her she was “cotched up in twelve gentlemen’s
2073,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"arms, and never felt her feet till the corner of Abingdon Street.”"
2074,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,
2075,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"The whole of the Foot Guards were in attendance, as well as a"
2076,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"great number of the police, but the thieves had mustered in great"
2077,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"force, and there was a good deal of plundering, which was however"
2078,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,checked temporarily by a gentleman said to be one of the members and
2079,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"magistrates for Essex, who jumped up on a railing and addressed the"
2080,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"populace to the following effect, “How do you hall dare!”"
2081,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,
2082,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,The origin of the fire is involved in much mystery; nor is it correctly
2083,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,ascertained by whom it was first discovered. Some say that one of the
2084,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"serjeants, in taking up the insignia, was astonished to find the mace"
2085,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"as hot as ginger. Others relate that a Mr. Spell, or Shell, or Snell,"
2086,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"whilst viewing the House, although no dancer, began suddenly, and in"
2087,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"his boots, to the utter amazement of his companions and Mrs. Wright,"
2088,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"the housekeeper, to jump and caper like a bear upon a hotted floor."
2089,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,This story certainly seems to countenance a report that the mischief
2090,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"originated in the warming apparatus, an opinion that is very current,"
2091,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"but, for my own part, I cannot conceive that the Collective Wisdom,"
2092,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"which knows how to lay down laws for us all, should not know how to lay"
2093,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"down flues. Rumours of Incendiarism are also very generally prevalent,"
2094,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,and stories are in circulation of the finding of half-burnt matches and
2095,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,other combustibles. But these facts rest on very frail foundations. The
2096,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,links said to have been found in the Speaker’s garden have turned out
2097,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,to be nothing but German sausages; and another cock-and-a-bull that has
2098,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,got abroad will probably come to no better end. A Mr. Dudley affirms
2099,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,"that he smelt the fire before it broke out, at Cooper’s Hill; but such"
2100,THE GREAT CONFLAGRATION.,olfactories are too much like manufactories to be believed.

2107,X. Y. Z.,
2108,X. Y. Z.,"The writer of these lines, who resides in Lambeth, was first awakened"
2109,X. Y. Z.,to a sense of conflagration by a cry of “Fire” from a number of persons
2110,X. Y. Z.,who were running in the direction of Westminster Bridge. Owning myself
2111,X. Y. Z.,"a warm enthusiast on the subject of ignition, and indeed not having"
2112,X. Y. Z.,"missed a fire for the last fifty years, except one, and that was only a"
2113,X. Y. Z.,"chimney, it may be supposed the exclamation in question had an electric"
2114,X. Y. Z.,"effect. We are all the slaves of some physical bias, strange as it may"
2115,X. Y. Z.,appear to others with opposite tendencies. It is recorded of some great
2116,X. Y. Z.,"marshal that he disliked music, but testified the liveliest pleasure at"
2117,X. Y. Z.,"a salvo of artillery or a roll of thunder, and the rumble of an engine"
2118,X. Y. Z.,"has the same effect on the author of these lines. To say I am a guebre,"
2119,X. Y. Z.,"or fire-worshipper, is only to confess the truth. I have a sort of"
2120,X. Y. Z.,"observatory erected on the roof of my house, from which, if there be a"
2121,X. Y. Z.,"break-out within the circuit of the metropolis, it may be discovered,"
2122,X. Y. Z.,and before going to bed I invariably visit this look-out.
2123,X. Y. Z.,
2124,X. Y. Z.,"Every man has his hobby-horse, and, figuratively speaking, mine was"
2125,X. Y. Z.,always kept harnessed and ready to run to a fire with the first engine.
2126,X. Y. Z.,"Many a time I have arrived before the turncocks, though I perhaps had"
2127,X. Y. Z.,"to traverse half London, and I scarcely remember an instance that I"
2128,X. Y. Z.,did not appear long before the water. Habit is second nature--I verily
2129,X. Y. Z.,"believe I could sniff a conflagration by instinct; and if I was not, I"
2130,X. Y. Z.,"ought to have been, the trainer of the firemen’s dog, which at present"
2131,X. Y. Z.,"attracts so much of the public attention, by his eager running along"
2132,X. Y. Z.,"with the Sun, the Globe, the British, and the Hand-in-Hand."

2134,X. Y. Z.,[Illustration: “’TIS DISTANCE LENDS ENCHANTMENT TO THE VIEW.”]
2135,X. Y. Z.,
2136,X. Y. Z.,"Of course I have seen a great many fires in my time--Rotherhithe,"
2137,X. Y. Z.,"the theatres, the Custom-house, &c. &c. I remember in the days of"
2138,X. Y. Z.,"Thistlewood and Co., when the metropolis was expected to be set on"
2139,X. Y. Z.,"fire, I slept for three weeks in my clothes in order to be ready for"
2140,X. Y. Z.,the first alarm; for I had the good fortune to witness the great riots
2141,X. Y. Z.,"of 1780, when no less than eight fires were blazing at once, and a"
2142,X. Y. Z.,"lamentable sight it was. I say lamentable, because it was impossible"
2143,X. Y. Z.,to be present at them all at the same time; but my good genius directed
2144,X. Y. Z.,"me to Langdale’s the Distiller, which made (excuse the vulgar popular"
2145,X. Y. Z.,phrase) a very satisfactory flare-up.
2146,X. Y. Z.,
2147,X. Y. Z.,"The Rotherhithe fire, not the recent little job, but some fifteen"
2148,X. Y. Z.,"or twenty years ago, was also on a grand scale, and very lasting."
2149,X. Y. Z.,The engine-pipes were wilfully cut; and I remember some of my
2150,X. Y. Z.,"friends rallying me on my well-known propensity, jocularly accusing"
2151,X. Y. Z.,me of lending my knife and my assistance. The Custom-house was a
2152,X. Y. Z.,"disappointment; it certainly cleared itself effectually, but it was"
2153,X. Y. Z.,"done by day-light, and consequently the long-room fell short of my"
2154,X. Y. Z.,anticipations. Drury-lane and Covent-garden were better: but I have
2155,X. Y. Z.,observed generally that theatres burn with more attention to stage
2156,X. Y. Z.,effect. They avoid the noon; a dark night to a fire is like the black
2157,X. Y. Z.,"letters in a benefit-bill, setting off the red ones."
2158,X. Y. Z.,
2159,X. Y. Z.,"The destruction of the Kent Indiaman I should like to have witnessed,"
2160,X. Y. Z.,but contrary to the opinion of many experienced amateurs I conceive
2161,X. Y. Z.,the Dartford Mills must have been a failure. Powder magazines make
2162,X. Y. Z.,very indifferent conflagrations; they are no sooner on fire than they
2163,X. Y. Z.,"are off,--all is over before you know where you are, and there is no"
2164,X. Y. Z.,"getting under, which quite puts you out. But fires, generally, are not"
2165,X. Y. Z.,"what they used to be. What with gas, and new police, steam, and one"
2166,X. Y. Z.,"cause or other, they have become what one might call slow explosions."
2167,X. Y. Z.,"A body of flame bursts from all the windows at once, and before B 25"
2168,X. Y. Z.,"can call fi-er in two syllables, the roof falls in, and all is over."
2169,X. Y. Z.,It was not so in _my_ time. First a little smoke would issue from a
2170,X. Y. Z.,"window-shutter, like the puff of a cigar, and after a long spring of"
2171,X. Y. Z.,"his rattle, the rheumatic watchman had time to knock double and treble"
2172,X. Y. Z.,"knocks, from No. 9 to No. 35, before a spark made its appearance out of"
2173,X. Y. Z.,"the chimney-pot. The Volunteers had time to assemble under arms, and"
2174,X. Y. Z.,"muffle their drums, and the bell-ringers to collect in the belfry, and"
2175,X. Y. Z.,"pull an alarm peal backwards. The parish engines even, although pulled"
2176,X. Y. Z.,"along by the pursy churchwardens, and the paralytic paupers, contrived"
2177,X. Y. Z.,to arrive before the fire fairly broke out in the shape of a little
2178,X. Y. Z.,"squib-like eruption from the garret-window. The affrighted family,"
2179,X. Y. Z.,"fourteen in number, all elaborately drest in their best Sunday clothes,"
2180,X. Y. Z.,"saved themselves by the street-door, according to seniority, the"
2181,X. Y. Z.,"furniture was carefully removed, and after an hour’s pumping, the fire"
2182,X. Y. Z.,"was extinguished without extending beyond the room where it originated,"
2183,X. Y. Z.,namely a bed-room on the second floor. Such was the progress _in my
2184,X. Y. Z.,"time_ of a fire, but it is the fashion now to sacrifice everything"
2185,X. Y. Z.,"to _pace_. Look at our race-horses, and look at our fox-hounds,--and"
2186,X. Y. Z.,I will add look at our conflagrations. All that is cared for is a
2187,X. Y. Z.,"burst--no matter how short, if it be but rapid. The devouring element"
2188,X. Y. Z.,never sits down now to a regular meal--it pitches on a house and
2189,X. Y. Z.,_bolts_ it.
2190,X. Y. Z.,
2191,X. Y. Z.,But I am wandering from the point. The announcement of both Houses of
2192,X. Y. Z.,Parliament being in flames thrilled through every fibre. It seemed
2193,X. Y. Z.,to promise what I may call a crowning event to the Conflagrationary
2194,X. Y. Z.,"Reminiscences of an Octogenarian. I snatched up my hat, and rushed into"
2195,X. Y. Z.,"the street, at eighty years of age, with the alacrity of eighteen, when"
2196,X. Y. Z.,"I ran from Highgate to Horselydown, to be present at the gutting of a"
2197,X. Y. Z.,ship chandler’s. As the bard says--
2198,X. Y. Z.,
2199,X. Y. Z.,"“Ev’n in our ashes live their wonted _fires_,”"
2200,X. Y. Z.,
2201,X. Y. Z.,and I could almost have supposed myself a fireman belonging to the
2202,X. Y. Z.,"Phœnix. My first step into the street discouraged me, the moonlight was"
2203,X. Y. Z.,"so brilliant, and in such cases the most splendid blaze is somewhat"
2204,X. Y. Z.,“shorn of its beams.” But a few steps reassured me. Even at the Surrey
2205,X. Y. Z.,side of the river the sparks and burning particles were falling like
2206,X. Y. Z.,flakes of snow--I mean of course the red snow formerly discovered by
2207,X. Y. Z.,"Captain Ross, and the light was so great that I could have read the"
2208,X. Y. Z.,"small print of the Police Gazette with the greatest ease, only I don’t"
2209,X. Y. Z.,"take it in. I of course made the best of my way towards the scene, but"
2210,X. Y. Z.,the crowd was already so dense that I could only attain a situation on
2211,X. Y. Z.,"the Strand opposite Cotton Gardens, up to my knees in mud. Both Houses"
2212,X. Y. Z.,"of Parliament were at this time in a blaze, and no doubt presented as"
2213,X. Y. Z.,"striking objects of conflagration as the metropolis could offer. I say,"
2214,X. Y. Z.,"“no doubt,”--forgetting jammed against a barge with my back towards"
2215,X. Y. Z.,"the fire, I am unable to state anything on my own authority as an"
2216,X. Y. Z.,"eye-witness, excepting that the buildings on the Surreyside exhibited"
2217,X. Y. Z.,a glowing reflection for some hours. At last the flowing of the tide
2218,X. Y. Z.,"caused the multitude to retreat, and releasing me from my retrospective"
2219,X. Y. Z.,"position allowed me to gaze upon the ruins. By what I hear, it was a"
2220,X. Y. Z.,"most imposing sight--but in spite of my Lord Althorpe, I cannot help"
2221,X. Y. Z.,"thinking that Westminster Hall, with its long range, would have made"
2222,X. Y. Z.,up an admirable fire. Neither can I agree with the many that it was an
2223,X. Y. Z.,"Incendiary Act, that passed through both houses so rapidly. To enjoy"
2224,X. Y. Z.,"the thing, a later hour and a darker night would certainly have been"
2225,X. Y. Z.,chosen. Fire-light and moon-light do not _mix well_:--they are best

2296,SENEX.,WHEN I am come first to the fire it was not long burnt up; and I was
2297,SENEX.,"oblige to walk up and down the floor to keep myself warm. At last, I"
2298,SENEX.,"take my seat on the stove, quite convenient to look about. In the House"
2299,SENEX.,"of Commons there was nobody, and I am all alone. The first thing I"
2300,SENEX.,"observe was a great many rats, ratting about--but they did not known"
2301,SENEX.,which way to turn. So they were all burnt dead. The flames grew very
2302,SENEX.,"fast; and I am interested very much with the seats, how they burned,"
2303,SENEX.,quite different from one another. Some seats made what you call a great
2304,SENEX.,"splutter, and popped and bounced, and some other seats made no noise"
2305,SENEX.,at all. Mr. Bulwer’s place burned of a blue colour; Mr. Buckstone’s
2306,SENEX.,turned quite black; and there was one made a flame the colour of a
2307,SENEX.,"drab. I observe one green flame and one orange, side by side, and they"
2308,SENEX.,hiss and roar at one another very furious. The gallery cleared itself
2309,SENEX.,"quite quickly, and the seat of Messieurs the reporters, exploded itself"
2310,SENEX.,like a cannon of forty-eight pounds. The speaking chair burnt without
2311,SENEX.,any sound at all.
2312,SENEX.,
2313,SENEX.,"When everything is quite done in the Commons I leave them off, and go"
2314,SENEX.,"to the House of Lords, where the fire was all in one sheet, and almost"
2315,SENEX.,the whole of its inside burnt out. I was able in this room to take
2316,SENEX.,off my great coat. I could find nothing to be saved except one great
2317,SENEX.,"ink-stand, that was red hot, and which I carry away in my two hands."
2318,SENEX.,"Likewise here, as well as in the Commons, I bottled up several bottles"
2319,SENEX.,"of smoke, to distribute afterwards, at five guineas a-piece, and may be"
2320,SENEX.,"more; for I know the English people admire such things, and are fond"
2321,SENEX.,"after reliques, like a madness almost. I did not make a long stop, for"
2322,SENEX.,"whenever I was visible, the pompiers was so foolish as play water upon"
2323,SENEX.,"me, and I was afraid of a catch-cold. In fact, when I arrive at home,"

2333,"BUSHELL,","When you made a holiday last Whitsuntide to see the Sights of London,"
2334,"BUSHELL,","in your way to the Waxwork and Westminster Abbey, you probably noticed"
2335,"BUSHELL,","a vast pile of buildings in Palace Yard, and you stood and scratched"
2336,"BUSHELL,","that shock head of yours, and wondered whose fine houses they were."
2337,"BUSHELL,","Seeing you to be a country clodpole, no doubt some well-dressed"
2338,"BUSHELL,","vagabond, by way of putting a hoax upon the hawbuck, told you that in"
2339,"BUSHELL,","those buildings congregated all the talent, all the integrity and"
2340,"BUSHELL,",public spirit of the country--that beneath those roofs the best and
2341,"BUSHELL,","wisest, and the most honest men to be found in three kingdoms, met"
2342,"BUSHELL,","to deliberate and enact the most wholesome, and just, and judicious"
2343,"BUSHELL,",laws for the good of the nation. He called them the oracles of our
2344,"BUSHELL,","constitution, the guardians of our rights, and the assertors of our"
2345,"BUSHELL,","liberties. Of course, Bushell, you were told all this; but nobody told"
2346,"BUSHELL,","you, I dare say, that within those walls your master had lifted up his"
2347,"BUSHELL,","voice, and delivered the only sound, rational, and wholesome, upright,"
2348,"BUSHELL,","and able speeches that were ever uttered in St. Stephen’s Chapel. No,"
2349,"BUSHELL,","nobody told you that. But when I come home, Bushell, I will lend you"
2350,"BUSHELL,","all my printed speeches, and when you have spelt them, and read them,"
2351,"BUSHELL,","and studied them, and got them by heart, bumpkin as you are, Bushell,"
2352,"BUSHELL,",you will know as much of legislation as all our precious members

2356,"BUSHELL,",
2357,"BUSHELL,","Well, Bushell, the fine houses you stood gaping at are burnt down,"
2358,"BUSHELL,","gutted, as the vulgar call it, and nothing is left but the bare walls."
2359,"BUSHELL,","You saw Farmer Gubbins’ house, or, at least, the shell of it, after"
2360,"BUSHELL,","the fire there: well, the Parliament Houses are exactly in the same"
2361,"BUSHELL,","state. There is news for you! and now, Bushell, how do you feel? Why,"
2362,"BUSHELL,","if the well-dressed vagabond told you the truth, you feel as if you had"
2363,"BUSHELL,","had a stroke--for all the British Constitution is affected, and you"
2364,"BUSHELL,","are a fraction of it, that is to say, a British subject. Your bacon"
2365,"BUSHELL,","grows rusty in your mouth, and your table-beer turns to vinegar on your"
2366,"BUSHELL,","palate. You cannot sleep at night, or work by day. You have no heart"
2367,"BUSHELL,",for anything. You can hardly drag one clouted shoe after another. And
2368,"BUSHELL,","how do you look? Why, as pale as a parsnip, and as thin as a hurdle,"
2369,"BUSHELL,",and your carroty locks stand bolt upright as if you had just met old
2370,"BUSHELL,",Lawson’s ghost with his head under his arm. I say thus you must feel
2371,"BUSHELL,","and look, Bushell, if what the well-dressed vagabond told you is the"
2372,"BUSHELL,",truth. But is that the case? No. You drink your small-beer with a sigh
2373,"BUSHELL,","and smack of delight; and you bolt your bacon with a relish, as if, as"
2374,"BUSHELL,","the virtuous Americans say, you could “go the whole hog.” Your clouted"
2375,"BUSHELL,",shoes clatter about as if you were counting hobnails with the Lord
2376,"BUSHELL,","Mayor, and you work like a young horse, or an old ass, and at night"
2377,"BUSHELL,",you snore like an oratorio of jews’ harps. Your face is as bold and
2378,"BUSHELL,","ruddy as the Red Lion’s. Your carroty locks lie sleek upon your poll,"
2379,"BUSHELL,","and as for poor old Lawson’s ghost, you could lend him flesh and blood"
2380,"BUSHELL,","enough to set him up again in life. But what, say you, does all this"
2381,"BUSHELL,","tend to? I will tell you, Bushell. There are a great many well-dressed"
2382,"BUSHELL,","vagabonds, besides the one you met in Palace Yard, who would persuade"
2383,"BUSHELL,",a poor man that a House of Lords or Commons is as good to him as his
2384,"BUSHELL,","bread, beer, beef, bacon, bed, and breeches; and therefore I address"
2385,"BUSHELL,","this to you, Bushell, to set such notions to rights by an appeal to"
2386,"BUSHELL,",your own back and belly. And now I will tell you what you shall do. You
2387,"BUSHELL,","shall go three nights a week to the Red Lion (when your work is done),"
2388,"BUSHELL,","and you may score up a pint of beer, at my cost, each time. And when"
2389,"BUSHELL,","the parson, or the exciseman, or the tax-gatherer, or any such gentry,"
2390,"BUSHELL,","begin to talk of that deplorable great burning, and the national"
2391,"BUSHELL,","calamity, and such-like trash, you shall pull out my letter and read"
2392,"BUSHELL,","to them--I say, Bushell, you shall read this letter to them, twice"
2393,"BUSHELL,","over, loudly and distinctly, and tell them from me, that the burning of"
2394,"BUSHELL,",twenty Parliament Houses wouldn’t be such a national calamity as a fire
2395,"BUSHELL,","at No. 1, Bolt Court."

2641,"DAVIS,",I hope to God this will find you at home--I am writing in a state
2642,"DAVIS,",of mind bordering on madness. I can’t collect myself to give
2643,"DAVIS,","particulars--you will have a newspaper along with this--read that,"
2644,"DAVIS,",and your hair will stand on end. Incendiarism has reached its height
2645,"DAVIS,",like the flaming thing on the top of the Monument. Our crisis is come.
2646,"DAVIS,","To my mind--political suicide--is as bad as felo de se. Oh Whigs,"
2647,"DAVIS,","Whigs, Whigs--what have you brought us to! As the Britannic Guardian"
2648,"DAVIS,",well says--England is gone to Italy--London is at Naples--and we are
2649,"DAVIS,",all standing on the top of Vesuvius. I have heard--and I believe
2650,"DAVIS,",it--that an attempt has been made to choke Aldgate Pump. A Waltham
2651,"DAVIS,",Abbey paper says positively that the mills were recently robbed of 513
2652,"DAVIS,","barrels of powder, the exact number of the members for England and"
2653,"DAVIS,",Wales. What a diabolical refinement--to blow up a government with its
2654,"DAVIS,",own powder! I can hardly persuade myself I am in England. God knows
2655,"DAVIS,",where it will spread to--I mean the incendiary spirit. The dry season
2656,"DAVIS,",is frightful--I suppose the springs are all dry. Keep the engine
2657,"DAVIS,",locked in the stable for fear of a cut at the pipes. I’ll send you
2658,"DAVIS,","down two more. Let all the labourers take a turn at them, by way of"
2659,"DAVIS,",practice. I’m persuaded the Parliament houses were burnt on purpose.
2660,"DAVIS,",The flue story is ridiculous. Mr. Cooper’s is a great deal more to the
2661,"DAVIS,",point. I believe everything I hear. A bunch of matches was found in
2662,"DAVIS,",the Speaker’s kitchen. I saw something suspicious myself--some said
2663,"DAVIS,","treacle, but I say tar. Have your eyes about you--lock all the gates,"
2664,"DAVIS,","day as well as night--and above all, watch the stacks. One Tiger is not"
2665,"DAVIS,","enough--get three or four more, I should have said Cæsar, but you know"
2666,"DAVIS,","I mean the house-dog. Good mastiffs,--the biggest and savagest you can"
2667,"DAVIS,",get. The gentry will be attempted first--beginning with the M.P.’s.
2668,"DAVIS,",You and Barnes and Sam must sit up by turns--and let the maids sit up
2669,"DAVIS,",too--women have sharp ears and sharp tongues.--If a mouse stirs I would
2670,"DAVIS,",have them squall--danger or no danger. It’s the only way to sleep in
2671,"DAVIS,",security--and comfort. I have read that the common goose is a vigilant
2672,"DAVIS,",creature--and saved Rome. Get a score of them at the next market--don’t
2673,"DAVIS,",stand about price--but choose them with good cackles. Alarm them now
2674,"DAVIS,","and then to keep them watchful, Fire the blunderbuss off every night,"
2675,"DAVIS,",and both fowling pieces and all the pistols. If all the Gentry did
2676,"DAVIS,","as much, it might keep the country quiet. If you were to ring the"
2677,"DAVIS,","alarm-bell once or twice in the middle of the night, it would be as"
2678,"DAVIS,",well--you would know then what help to depend upon. Search the house
2679,"DAVIS,","often from the garret to the cellar, for combustibles--if you could"
2680,"DAVIS,","manage to go without candles, or any sort of light, it would be better."
2681,"DAVIS,",
2682,"DAVIS,",[Illustration: THE MOVEMENT PARTY.]
2683,"DAVIS,",
2684,"DAVIS,",You’d find your way about in the dark after a little practice. Pray
2685,"DAVIS,",don’t allow any sweethearts; they may be Swings and Captain Rocks in
2686,"DAVIS,","disguise, and their pretended flames turn out real. I’ve misgivings"
2687,"DAVIS,","about the maids. Tie them up and taste their liver, before they eat"
2688,"DAVIS,",it themselves--I mean the house-dogs; but my agitation makes me
2689,"DAVIS,","unconnected. The scoundrels often poison them, before they attempt"
2690,"DAVIS,",robbery and arson. Keep the cattle in the cowhouse for fear of their
2691,"DAVIS,",being houghed and hamstrung. Surely there were great defects somewhere.
2692,"DAVIS,",The Houses could not have been properly protected--if they had been
2693,"DAVIS,",watched as well as they were lighted--but it is too late to cast any
2694,"DAVIS,",blame on individuals. A paltry spirit of economy has been our bane. A
2695,"DAVIS,",few shillings would have purchased a watch-dog; and one or two geese in
2696,"DAVIS,",each house might have saved the capitol of the constitution! But the
2697,"DAVIS,",incendiary knew how to choose his time--an adjournment when there were
2698,"DAVIS,",none sitting.
2699,"DAVIS,",
2700,"DAVIS,","I say incendiary, because no doubt can exist in any cool mind, that"
2701,"DAVIS,",enters into the conflagration. I transcribe conclusive extracts from
2702,"DAVIS,","several papers, the editors of which I know to be upright men, and they"
2703,"DAVIS,",all write on one side.
2704,"DAVIS,",
2705,"DAVIS,","“We are confidently informed,” says the Beacon, “that a quantity of"
2706,"DAVIS,","tar-barrels was purchased at No. 2, High-street, Shadwell, about ten"
2707,"DAVIS,",o’clock on the morning of the fire. There was abundant time before six
2708,"DAVIS,","a.m., for removing the combustibles to Westminster. The purchaser was a"
2709,"DAVIS,","short, squat, down-looking man, and the name on his cart was I. Burns.”"
2710,"DAVIS,",
2711,"DAVIS,","“Trifling circumstances,” says the Sentinel, “sometimes point to great"
2712,"DAVIS,",results. Our own opinion is formed. We have made it our business to
2713,"DAVIS,",examine the Guys in preparation for the impending anniversary of the
2714,"DAVIS,","Gunpowder Plot, and we affirm that every one of the effigies bore a"
2715,"DAVIS,",striking resemblance to some member or other of assemblies we need not
2716,"DAVIS,",name. These are signs of the times.”
2717,"DAVIS,",
2718,"DAVIS,","“We should be loth,” says the Detector, “to impute the late calamity to"
2719,"DAVIS,",any particular party: but we may reasonably inquire what relative stake
2720,"DAVIS,",in the country is possessed by the Whigs and the Tories. The English
2721,"DAVIS,",language may be taken as a fair standard. The first may lay claim to
2722,"DAVIS,","perri-_wig_, scratch-_wig_, tie-_wig_, bob-_wig_, in short, the whole"
2723,"DAVIS,","family of the perruques, with _whig_-maleery. The latter, not to"
2724,"DAVIS,","mention other good things, have a vested right in ora_tory_, his_tory_,"
2725,"DAVIS,","terri_tory_, and vic_tory_. Can a man of common patriotism have a doubt"
2726,"DAVIS,",which side it is his interest to adhere to?”
2727,"DAVIS,",
2728,"DAVIS,",[Illustration: “WHEN SHALL WE THREE MEET AGAIN?”]
2729,"DAVIS,",
2730,"DAVIS,","That last paragraph, Davis, is what I call sound argument. Indeed I"
2731,"DAVIS,",don’t see how it is to be answered. You see they are all nem. con.
2732,"DAVIS,","as to our danger, and decidedly reckon fire an inflammatory agent."
2733,"DAVIS,","Take care what you read. Very pernicious doctrines are abroad, and"
2734,"DAVIS,",especially across the Western Channel. The Irish are really frightful.
2735,"DAVIS,","I’m told they tie the cows’ tails together, and then saw off their"
2736,"DAVIS,",horns for insurrectionary bugles. The foundations of society are
2737,"DAVIS,","shaken all over the world--the Whiteboys in Ireland, and the Blacks"
2738,"DAVIS,","in the West Indies, all seem to fight under the same colours. It’s"
2739,"DAVIS,",time for honest men to rally round themselves--but I’m sorry to say
2740,"DAVIS,",public spirit and love of one’s country are at a low ebb. There’s too
2741,"DAVIS,",much Americanism. One writer wants us to turn all our English wheat
2742,"DAVIS,","to Indian corn, and to grow no sort of apples but Franklin pippins."
2743,"DAVIS,",We want strong measures against associations and unions. There’s
2744,"DAVIS,","demagogues abroad--and they wear white hats. By-the-bye, I more"
2745,"DAVIS,",than half suspect that fellow Johnson is a delegate. Take him to the
2746,"DAVIS,","ale-house, and treat him freely--it may warm him to blab something."
2747,"DAVIS,","Besides, you will see what sort of papers the public-houses take in."
2748,"DAVIS,",You may drop a hint about their licenses. Give my compliments to Dr.
2749,"DAVIS,","Garratt, and tell him I hope he will preach to the times, and take"
2750,"DAVIS,","strong texts. I wish I could be down amongst you, but I cannot desert"
2751,"DAVIS,","my post. You may tell the tenantry, and electors--I’m burnt out and"
2752,"DAVIS,",gutted--but my heart’s in the right place--and devoted to constituents.
2753,"DAVIS,","Come what may, I will be an unshaken pillar on the basis of my circular"
2754,"DAVIS,",letter. Don’t forget any of my precautions. I am sorry I did not bring
2755,"DAVIS,",all the plate up to town--but at the first alarm bury it. Take in no
2756,"DAVIS,",letters or notices; for what you know they may be threatenings. If
2757,"DAVIS,","any Irishman applies for work, discharge him instantly. All the old"
2758,"DAVIS,","spring-guns had better be set again, they are not now legal, but I am"
2759,"DAVIS,","ministerial, and if they did go off, the higher powers would perhaps"
2760,"DAVIS,","wink at them. But it’s fire that I am afraid of, fire that destroyed"
2761,"DAVIS,","my political roof, and may now assail my paternal one. Walk, as I may"
2762,"DAVIS,","say, bucket in hand, and be ready every moment for a break out. You"
2763,"DAVIS,","may set fire to the small faggot stack, and try your hands at getting"
2764,"DAVIS,",it under--there’s nothing worse than being taken by surprise. Read
2765,"DAVIS,","this letter frequently, and impress these charges on your mind. It"
2766,"DAVIS,","is a sad change for England to have become, I may say, this fiery"
2767,"DAVIS,","furnace. I have not the least doubt, if properly traced, the burning"
2768,"DAVIS,","cliff at Weymouth would be found to be connected with Incendiarism, and"
2769,"DAVIS,",the Earthquakes at Chichester with our political convulsions. Thank
2770,"DAVIS,","Providence in your prayers, Davis, that your own station forbids your"
2771,"DAVIS,","being an M.P., for a place in parliament is little better than sitting"
2772,"DAVIS,","on a barrel of gunpowder. Honour forbids to resign, or I should wish I"
2773,"DAVIS,","was nothing but a simple country gentleman. Remember, and be vigilant."
2774,"DAVIS,","Once more I cry Watch, Watch, Watch! By adopting the motions I propose,"

2786,"RESPECTED MADAM,","I received your Ladyship’s obliging commands, and have used my best"

2788,"RESPECTED MADAM,","to political controversy, I beg to say I have imposed a tacit silence"
2789,"RESPECTED MADAM,","on the domestic capacities as far as within the sphere of my control,"
2790,"RESPECTED MADAM,","but lament to say the Bailiff, Mr. Davis, is a party unamenable to"
2791,"RESPECTED MADAM,","my authority, and as such has taken liberties with decorum quite"
2792,"RESPECTED MADAM,",unconsistent with propriety and the decency due. However reluctant
2793,"RESPECTED MADAM,","to censoriousness, duty compels to communicate subversive conduct"
2794,"RESPECTED MADAM,",quite unconformable to decency’s rules and order in a well-regulated
2795,"RESPECTED MADAM,",establishment. I allude to Mr. Davis’s terrifically jumping out from
2796,"RESPECTED MADAM,","behind doors and in obscure dark corners, on the female domestics, for"
2797,"RESPECTED MADAM,","no reasonable purpose I can discover, except to make them exert their"
2798,"RESPECTED MADAM,","voices in a very alarming manner. The housemaid, indeed, confirms me"
2799,"RESPECTED MADAM,","by saying in her own words, “he considered her skreek the best skreek"
2800,"RESPECTED MADAM,","in the family.” If impropriety had proceeded no further, I should have"
2801,"RESPECTED MADAM,","hesitated to trouble your Ladyship with particulars; but Mr. Davis,"
2802,"RESPECTED MADAM,",not satisfied with thus working on the unsophisticated terrors of
2803,"RESPECTED MADAM,","ignorant females, thought proper to horrify with inflammatory reports."

2809,"RESPECTED MADAM,","One night, as a prominent instance, about twelve o’clock, he rang the"
2810,"RESPECTED MADAM,","alarm bell so violently, at the same time proclaiming conflagration,"
2811,"RESPECTED MADAM,","that the law of preservation became our paramount duty, and, as a"
2812,"RESPECTED MADAM,","consequence, we all escaped in a state of dishabille only to be"
2813,"RESPECTED MADAM,","ambiguously hinted at, by saying that time did not allow to put on my"
2814,"RESPECTED MADAM,","best lutestring to meet the neighbouring gentry--and must add, with"
2815,"RESPECTED MADAM,","indignation, in the full blaze of a heap of straw, thought proper to"
2816,"RESPECTED MADAM,",be set on fire by Mr. Davis in the fore-court. I trust your Ladyship
2817,"RESPECTED MADAM,","will excuse a little warmth of language, in saying it was highly"
2818,"RESPECTED MADAM,","reprehensible; but I have not depictured the worst. I, one evening,"
2819,"RESPECTED MADAM,","lighted up what I conceived to be a mould candle, and your Ladyship"
2820,"RESPECTED MADAM,",will imagine my undescribable fright when it exploded itself like a
2821,"RESPECTED MADAM,","missile of the squib description, an unwarrantable mode, I must say,"
2822,"RESPECTED MADAM,","of convincing me, as Mr. Davis had the audaciousness to own to,"
2823,"RESPECTED MADAM,",that we may be made to be actors in our own combustion. To suppose
2824,"RESPECTED MADAM,","at my years and experience, I can be unsensible of the danger of"
2825,"RESPECTED MADAM,","fire, must be a preposterous notion; but all his subsequent acts"
2826,"RESPECTED MADAM,",partake an agreeable character. For fear of being consumed in our
2827,"RESPECTED MADAM,","beds, as he insidiously professed, he exerted all his influential"
2828,"RESPECTED MADAM,","arguments to persuade the females to set up nocturnally all night,"
2829,"RESPECTED MADAM,","a precaution of course declined, as well as his following scheme,"
2830,"RESPECTED MADAM,",being almost too much broached with absurdity to enumerate. I mean
2831,"RESPECTED MADAM,",every retiring female reposing her confidence on a live goose in her
2832,"RESPECTED MADAM,","chamber, as were purchased for the express purpose, but need not add"
2833,"RESPECTED MADAM,",were dispensed with by rational beings. I trust your ladyship will
2834,"RESPECTED MADAM,",acquit of uncharitableness if I suspect it was out of vindictive
2835,"RESPECTED MADAM,",feelings at their opposition to the geese that Mr. Davis insinuated a
2836,"RESPECTED MADAM,","strict inquiry into every individual that came into the house, as far"
2837,"RESPECTED MADAM,",even as requiring to be personally present at all that passed between
2838,"RESPECTED MADAM,",the dairymaid and her cousin. It escaped memory to say that when the
2839,"RESPECTED MADAM,","feminine department refused to be deprived of rest, the male servants"
2840,"RESPECTED MADAM,","were equally adverse to go to bed, being spirited up by Mr. Davis to"
2841,"RESPECTED MADAM,","spend the night together, and likewise being furnished with the best"
2842,"RESPECTED MADAM,","strong ale in the cellar by his imperious directions, which, by way of"
2843,"RESPECTED MADAM,","climax to assurance, was alleged to be by order of Sir Jacob himself."
2844,"RESPECTED MADAM,",I say nothing reflectively on his repeatedly discharging his artillery
2845,"RESPECTED MADAM,","at unseasonable hours, the shock principally concerning my own nervous"
2846,"RESPECTED MADAM,","constitution, which was so vibrated as to require calling in physical"
2847,"RESPECTED MADAM,","powers: and Doctor Tudor, considering advanced age and infirmity, is"
2848,"RESPECTED MADAM,",of opinion I may require to be under his professional hands for an
2849,"RESPECTED MADAM,",ensuing twelvemonth. Of startling effects upon other parties I may
2850,"RESPECTED MADAM,","make comments more unreserved, and without harsh extenuation must"
2851,"RESPECTED MADAM,","say, his letting off reports without due notice, frequently when the"
2852,"RESPECTED MADAM,","females had valuable cut glass and china in their hands, or on their"
2853,"RESPECTED MADAM,","trays, was blamable in the extreme, to express the least of it. Another"
2854,"RESPECTED MADAM,","feature which caused much unpleasantness, was Mr. Davis persisting to"
2855,"RESPECTED MADAM,","scrutinise and rummage the entire premises from top to bottom, but on"
2856,"RESPECTED MADAM,","this characteristic tediousness forbids to dwell, and more particularly"
2857,"RESPECTED MADAM,","as mainly affecting himself, such as the flow of blood from his nose,"
2858,"RESPECTED MADAM,","and two coagulated eyes, from the cellar door, through a peculiar"
2859,"RESPECTED MADAM,",whim of looking for every thing in a state of absolute obscurity. I
2860,"RESPECTED MADAM,","may add, by way of incident, that Mr. Davis walks lame from a canine"
2861,"RESPECTED MADAM,","injury in the calf of his leg, which I hope will not prove rabid in the"
2862,"RESPECTED MADAM,","end,--but the animals he has on his own responsibility introduced on"
2863,"RESPECTED MADAM,","the premises, really resemble, begging your Ladyship’s pardon for the"
2864,"RESPECTED MADAM,","expression, what are denominated D.’s incarnate."
2865,"RESPECTED MADAM,",
2866,"RESPECTED MADAM,","Such, your Ladyship, is the unpropitious posture of domestic affairs"
2867,"RESPECTED MADAM,","at the Shrubbery, originating, I must say, exclusively from the"
2868,"RESPECTED MADAM,","unprecedented deviations of Mr. Davis. A mild construction would infer,"
2869,"RESPECTED MADAM,","from such extraordinary extravagance of conduct, a flightiness, or"
2870,"RESPECTED MADAM,","aberration of mind in the individual, but I deeply lament to say a"
2871,"RESPECTED MADAM,",more obvious cause exists to put a negative on such a surmise. For
2872,"RESPECTED MADAM,",the last week Mr. Davis has betrayed an unusual propensity to pass
2873,"RESPECTED MADAM,","his evenings at the George Tavern, and in consequence has several"
2874,"RESPECTED MADAM,",times exhibited himself in a Bacchanalian character to our extreme
2875,"RESPECTED MADAM,","discomforture, and on one occasion actually trespassed so far beyond"
2876,"RESPECTED MADAM,","the bounds of modesty, as to offer me the rudeness of a salute. I"
2877,"RESPECTED MADAM,",blush to impart such details to your Ladyship; but justice demands an
2878,"RESPECTED MADAM,","explicit statement, however repulsive to violated reserve and the rules"
2879,"RESPECTED MADAM,","of virtue. Amongst less immoral actions, I must advert to the arrival"
2880,"RESPECTED MADAM,","of two new engines with a vast number of leathern buckets, I fear"
2881,"RESPECTED MADAM,","ordered by Mr. Davis at my honoured master’s expense, and which are"
2882,"RESPECTED MADAM,","periodically exercised in pumping every day, by the gardeners and the"
2883,"RESPECTED MADAM,","hinds, being induced thereto by extra beverages of strong beer. By such"
2884,"RESPECTED MADAM,",means the aquatic supply of the well is frequently exhausted by playing
2885,"RESPECTED MADAM,","upon nothing,--and at this present moment I am justified in stating we"
2886,"RESPECTED MADAM,","have not sufficient water to fulfil culinary purposes, or the demands"
2887,"RESPECTED MADAM,",of cleanliness. I feel ashamed to say there is not a strictly clean cap

3038,"HONNERD SUR,","their presens, for want of hands. Evvery boddy had run so offen at"
3039,"HONNERD SUR,",the allarm bell that they got noboddy to go in there steed. It was an

3213,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,
3214,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,IT is not often when the Nine descend that they go so low as into
3215,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"areas; it is certain, nevertheless, that they were in the habit of"
3216,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"visiting John Humphreys, in the kitchen of No. 189, Portland Place,"
3217,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"disguised, no doubt, from mortal eye, as seamstresses or charwomen--at"
3218,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"all events, as Winifred Jenkins says, “they were never ketch’d in the"
3219,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"fact.” Perhaps it was the rule of the house to allow no followers, and"
3220,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"they were obliged to come by stealth, and to go in the same manner;"
3221,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"indeed, from the fragmental nature of John’s verses, they appear"
3222,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,to have often left him very abruptly. Other pieces bear witness of
3223,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,the severe distraction he suffered between his domestic duty to the
3224,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"Umphravilles, twelve in family, with their guests, and his own secret"
3225,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"visitors from Helicon. It must have been provoking, when seeking for"
3226,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"a simile, to be sent in search of a salt-cellar; or when hunting"
3227,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"for a rhyme, to have to look for a missing teaspoon. By a whimsical"
3228,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"peculiarity, the causes of these lets and hindrances are recorded in"
3229,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"his verses, by way of parenthesis: and though John’s poetry was of a"
3230,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"decidedly serious and moralising turn, these little insertions give"
3231,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"it so whimsical a character, as to make it an appropriate offering"
3232,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,in the present work. Poor John! the grave has put a period to his
3233,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"didactics, and the publication of his lays in “Hood’s Own,” therefore,"
3234,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"cannot give him pain, as it certainly would have done otherwise, for"
3235,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,the MSS. were left by last will and testament “to his very worthy
3236,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"master, Joshua Umphraville, Esq., to be printed in Elegant Extracts,"
3237,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,or Flowers of English Poetry.” The Editor is indebted to the kindness
3238,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,of that gentleman for a selection from the papers; which he has been
3239,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"unable to arrange chronologically, as John always wrote in too great a"
3240,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,hurry to put dates. Whether he ever sent any pieces to the periodicals
3241,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"is unknown, for he kept his authorship as secret as Junius’s, till"
3242,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"his death discovered his propensity for poetry, and happily cleared"
3243,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"up some points in John’s character, which had appeared to his"
3244,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"disadvantage. Thus when his eye was “in fine frenzy rolling,” bemused"
3245,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"only with Castalian water, he had been suspected of being “bemused with"
3246,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"beer;” and when he was supposed to indulge in a morning sluggishness,"
3247,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"he was really rising with the sun, at least with Apollo. He was accused"
3248,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"occasionally of shamming deafness, whereas it was doubtless nothing but"
3249,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"the natural difficulty of hearing more than Nine at once. Above all,"
3250,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,he was reckoned almost wilfully unfortunate in his breakage; but it
3251,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"appears that when deductions for damage were made from his wages, the"
3252,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"poetry ought to have been stopped, and not the money. The truth is,"
3253,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"John’s master was a classical scholar, and so accustomed to read of"
3254,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,"Pegasus, and to associate a Poet with a Horseman, that he never dreamt"
3255,BY AN OLD SERVANT.,of one as a Footman.

3793,THE ACCIDENT.,
3794,THE ACCIDENT.,"The speaker, a little active old woman, had run parallel with the coach"

3798,THE ACCIDENT.,"a parcel, to hunt for her clogs, to exchange the cook’s umbrella for"

3800,THE ACCIDENT.,"door-mat, was unable to escape the volley which the Virago still poured"
3801,THE ACCIDENT.,in upon him; but he kept a most imperturbable face and silence till he
3802,THE ACCIDENT.,was fairly seated again on the box.

3808,THE ACCIDENT.,"“I hope, friend, thee art not very apt to make these experiments on the"

3810,THE ACCIDENT.,answered Mat; “I have done very little in the accidental line--nothing
3811,THE ACCIDENT.,"worth mentioning. All the years I’ve been on the road, I’ve never"
3812,THE ACCIDENT.,"come to a kill on the spot; them sort o’things belongs to Burrowes,"
3813,THE ACCIDENT.,"as drives over one with the Friend in Need, and he’s got quite a name"
3814,THE ACCIDENT.,"for it. He’s called ‘Fatal Jack.’ To be sure, now I think of it, I was"
3815,THE ACCIDENT.,"the innocent cause of death to one person, and she was rather out of"
3816,THE ACCIDENT.,"the common.” “You fractured her limbs, p’r’aps?” inquired one of the"
3817,THE ACCIDENT.,"outsides. “No such thing,” said Mat, “there was nothing fractious in"
3818,THE ACCIDENT.,"the case; as to running over her limbs, it was the impossible thing"
3819,THE ACCIDENT.,with a woman born without legs and arms.” “You must allude to Miss
3820,THE ACCIDENT.,"Biffin,” said the outsider--“the Norfolk phenomenon.”"
3821,THE ACCIDENT.,
3822,THE ACCIDENT.,"“Begging your pardon,” said Mat, “it was before the Phenomenon was"
3823,THE ACCIDENT.,"started. It was one of the regular old long-bodied double-coaches,"
3824,THE ACCIDENT.,and I drove it myself. Very uneasy they were; for springs at that
3825,THE ACCIDENT.,time hadn’t much spring in ’em; and nobody on earth had thought of
3826,THE ACCIDENT.,Macadaming Piccadilly. You could always tell whether you were on the
3827,THE ACCIDENT.,"stones, or off, and no mistake. I was a full hour behind time--for"
3828,THE ACCIDENT.,coaches in them days wasn’t called by such names as Chronometers and
3829,THE ACCIDENT.,"Regulators, and good reason why. So I’d been plying a full hour after"
3830,THE ACCIDENT.,"time, without a soul inside, except a barrel of natives for a customer"
3831,THE ACCIDENT.,"down the road: at last, a hackney-coach pulls up, and Jarvey and the"
3832,THE ACCIDENT.,"waterman lifts Miss Biffin into my drag. Well, off I sets with a light"
3833,THE ACCIDENT.,"load enough, and to fetch up time astonished my team into a bit of a"
3834,THE ACCIDENT.,gallop--and it wasn’t the easiest thing in the world to keep one’s seat
3835,THE ACCIDENT.,"on the box, the coach jumped so over the stones. Well, away I goes,"
3836,THE ACCIDENT.,"springing my rattle till I come to the gate at Hyde Park Corner, where"
3837,THE ACCIDENT.,"one of my insides was waiting for me--and not very sorry to pull up,"
3838,THE ACCIDENT.,"for the breath was almost shook out of my bellows. Well, I opens the"
3839,THE ACCIDENT.,"door, and what do I see lying together at the bottom of the coach,"
3840,THE ACCIDENT.,"but Miss Biffin bruised unsensible, and the head out of the barrel of"

3907,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,poetry indeed is a crime ranking next to forgery in the counting-house
3908,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"code; and an Ode or a song dated Copthall Court, would be as certainly"
3909,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,noted and protested as a dishonoured bill. I have even heard of an
3910,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"unfortunate clerk, who lost his situation through being tempted by the"
3911,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,jingle to subscribe under an account current
3912,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
3913,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,“Excepted all errors

3915,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
3916,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,his employer emphatically declaring that Poetry and Logwood could never
3917,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,coexist in the same head. The principal of _our_ firm on the contrary
3918,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"had a turn for the Belles Lettres, and would have winked with both"
3919,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,eyes at verses which did not intrude into an invoice or confuse their
3920,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,figures with those of the Ledger. The true cause of my retirement from
3921,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Commercial affairs was more prosaic. My constitution, though far from"
3922,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"venerable, had begun to show symptoms of decay: my appetite failed,"
3923,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and its principal creditor, the stomach, received only an ounce in the"
3924,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,pound. My spirits daily became a shade lower--my flesh was held less
3925,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and less firmly--in short, in the language of the price current, it"
3926,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,was expected that I must “submit to a decline.” The Doctors who were
3927,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"called in, declared imperatively that a mercantile life would be the"
3928,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"death of me--that by so much sitting, I was hatching a whole brood of"
3929,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"complaints, and that no Physician would insure me as a merchantman from"
3930,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the Port of London to the next Spring. The Exchange, they said, was"
3931,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"against me, and as the Exchange itself used to ring with “Life let us"
3932,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Cherish,” there was no resisting the advice. I was ordered to abstain"
3933,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"from Ashes, Bristles, and Petersburg yellow candle, and to indulge in"
3934,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,a more generous diet--to take regular country exercise instead of the
3935,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Russia Walk, and to go to bed early even on Foreign Post nights. Above"
3936,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"all I was recommended change of air, and in particular the bracing"
3937,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"breezes of the North. Accordingly I was soon shipped as per advice,"
3938,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"in a Scotch Smack, which “_smacked_ through the breeze,” as Dibdin"
3939,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"sings so merrily, that on the fourth morning we were in sight of the"
3940,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,prominent old Steeple of “Bonny Dundee.”
3941,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
3942,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"My Biographer, in the Book of Gems, alludes to this voyage, and"
3943,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,infers from some verses--“Gadzooks! must one swear to the truth of a
3944,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,song?”--that it sickened me of the sea. Nothing can be more unfounded.
3945,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"The marine terrors and disagreeables enumerated in the poem, belong"
3946,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"to a Miss Oliver, and not to me, who regard the ocean with a natural"
3947,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,and national partiality. Constitutionally proof against that nausea
3948,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"which extorts so many wave-offerings from the afflicted, I am as"
3949,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"constant as Captain Basil Hall himself, in my regard “for the element"
3950,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"that never tires.” Some washy fellows, it is true, _Fresh_-men from"
3951,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Cambridge and the like, affect to prefer river or even pond water for"
3952,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"their aquatics--the tame ripple to the wild wave, the prose to “the"
3953,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"poetry of motion.” But give _me_ “the multitudinous sea,” resting"
3954,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"or rampant, with all its variable moods and changeable colouring."
3955,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Methought, when pining under the _maladie du pays_, on a hopeless, sick"
3956,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"bed, inland, in Germany, it would have relieved those yearnings but to"
3957,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"look across an element so instinct with English associations, that it"
3958,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,would seem rather to unite me to than sever me from my native island.
3959,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"And, truly, when I did at last stand on the brink of the dark blue"
3960,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"sea, my home-sick wishes seemed already half fulfilled, and it was not"
3961,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,till many months afterwards that I actually crossed the Channel. But
3962,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"I am, besides, personally under deep obligations to the great deep."
3963,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Twice, indeed, in a calm, and in a storm, has my life been threatened"
3964,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,with a salt-water catastrophe; but that quarrel has long been made
3965,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"up, and forgiven, in gratitude for the blessing and bracing influence"
3966,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,of the breezes that smack of the ocean brine. Dislike the sea!--With
3967,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"what delight aforetime used I to swim in it, to dive in it, to sail"
3968,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"on it! Ask honest Tom Woodgate, of Hastings, who made of me, for a"
3969,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"landsman, a tolerable boatsman. Even now, when do I feel so easy in"
3970,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"body, and so cheerful in spirit, as when walking hard by the surge,"
3971,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"listening, as if expecting some whisperings of friendly but distant"
3972,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"voices, in its eternal murmuring. Sick of the sea! If ever I have"
3973,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"a water-drinking fancy, it is a wish that the ocean brine had been"
3974,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"sweet, or sour instead of salt, so as to be potable; for what can be"
3975,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"more tempting _to the eye_ as a draught, than the pure fluid, almost"
3976,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"invisible with clearness, as it lies in some sandy scoop, or rocky"
3977,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"hollow, a true “Diamond of the Desert,” to say nothing of the same"
3978,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"living liquid in its effervescing state, when it sparkles up, hissing"
3979,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,and bubbling in the ship’s wake--the very Champaigne of water! Above
3980,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,all what intellectual solar and soothing syrup have I not derived from
3981,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the mere contemplation of the boundless main,--the most effectual and"
3982,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"innocent of mental sedatives, and often called in aid of that practical"
3983,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,philosophy it has been my wont to recommend in the present work. For
3984,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"whenever, owing to physical depression, or a discordant state of the"
3985,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"nerves, my personal vexations and cares, real or imaginary, become"
3986,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"importunate in my thoughts, and acquire, by morbid exaggeration, an"
3987,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"undue prominence and importance, what remedy then so infallible as"
3988,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"to mount to my solitary seat in the look-out, and thence gaze awhile"
3989,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"across the broad expanse, till in the presence of that vast horizon,"
3990,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"my proper troubles shrink to their true proportions, and I look on"
3991,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the whole race of men, with their insignificant pursuits, as so many"
3992,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,shrimpers! But this is a digression--We have made the harbour of
3993,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Dundee, and it is time to step ashore in “stout and original Scotland,”"
3994,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"as it is called by Doctor Adolphus Wagner, in his German edition of"
3995,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Burns[2].
3996,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
3997,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Like other shipments, I had been regularly addressed to the care of a"
3998,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"consignee:--but the latter, not anxious, probably, to take charge of"
3999,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"a hobbledehoy, yet at the same time unwilling to incur the reproach"
4000,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of having a relative in the same town and not under the same roof,"
4001,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"peremptorily declined the office. Nay, more, she pronounced against"
4002,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"me a capital sentence, so far as returning to the place from whence I"
4003,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"came, and even proceeded to bespeak my passage and reship my luggage."
4004,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Judging from such vigorous measures the temper of my customer, instead"
4005,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of remonstrating, I affected resignation, and went with a grave face"
4006,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"through the farce of a formal leave-taking; I even went on board, but"
4007,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,it was in company with a stout fellow who relanded my baggage; and
4008,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"thus, whilst my transporter imagined, good easy soul! that the rejected"
4009,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"article was sailing round St. Abb’s Head, or rolling off the Bass, he"
4010,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"was actually safe and snug in Dundee, quietly laughing in his sleeve"
4011,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"with the Law at his back. I have a confused recollection of meeting,"
4012,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"some three or four days afterwards, a female cousin on her road to"
4013,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"school, who at sight of me turned suddenly round, and galloped off"
4014,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,towards home with the speed of a scared heifer.
4015,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
4016,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"My first concern was now to look out for some comfortable roof, under"
4017,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,which “for a consideration” one would be treated as one of the family.
4018,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"I entered accordingly into a treaty with a respectable widower, who had"
4019,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"no sons of his own, but in spite of the most undeniable references, and"
4020,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"a general accordance as to terms, there occurred a mysterious hitch in"
4021,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the arrangement, arising from a whimsical prepossession which only came"
4022,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"afterwards to my knowledge--namely, that an English laddie, instead"
4023,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of supping parritch, would inevitably require a rump-steak to his"
4024,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,breakfeast! My next essay was more successful; and ended in my being
4025,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"regularly installed in a boarding-house, kept by a Scotchwoman, who was"
4026,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"not so sure of my being a beefeater. She was a sort of widow, with a"
4027,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"seafaring husband “as good as dead,” and in her appearance not unlike a"
4028,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"personification of _rouge et noir_, with her red eyes, her red face,"
4029,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"her yellow teeth, and her black velvet cap. The first day of my term"
4030,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"happened to be also the first day of the new year, and on stepping from"
4031,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"my bed-room, I encountered our Hostess--like a witch and her familiar"
4032,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"spirit--with a huge bottle of whiskey in one hand, and a glass in the"
4033,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"other. It was impossible to decline the dram she pressed upon me, and"
4034,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"very good it proved, and undoubtedly strong, seeing that for some time"
4035,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"I could only muse its praise in expressive silence, and indeed, I was"
4036,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,only able to speak with “a _small still_ voice” for several minutes
4037,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,afterwards. Such was my characteristic introduction to the Land of
4038,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Cakes, where I was destined to spend the greater part of two years,"
4039,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,under circumstances likely to materially influence the colouring and
4040,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,filling up of my future life.
4041,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
4042,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"To properly estimate the dangers of my position, imagine a boy of"
4043,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"fifteen, at the Nore, as it were, of life, thus left dependent on"
4044,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,his own pilotage for a safe voyage to the Isle of Man; or conceive
4045,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"a juvenile Telemachus, without a Mentor, brought suddenly into the"
4046,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,perilous neighbourhood of Calypso and her enchantments. It will hardly
4047,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"be expected, that from some half-dozen of young bachelors, there came"
4048,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,forth any solemn voice didactically warning me in the strain of the
4049,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"sage Imlac to the Prince of Abyssinia. In fact, I recollect receiving"
4050,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"but one solitary serious admonition, and that was from a she cousin of"
4051,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"ten years old, that the Spectator I was reading on a Sunday morning,"
4052,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,“was no the Bible.” For there was still much of this pious rigour
4053,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"extant in Scotland, though a gentleman was no longer committed to"
4054,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Tolboothia Infelix, for an unseasonable promenade during church time."
4055,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"It was once, however, my fortune to witness a sample of the _ancien"
4056,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,régime_ at an evening party composed chiefly of young and rather
4057,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"fashionable persons, when lo! like an Anachronism confounding times"
4058,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"past with times present, there came out of some corner an antique"
4059,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"figure, with quaintly cut blue suit and three-cornered hat, not unlike"
4060,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"a very old Greenwich Pensioner, who taking his stand in front of the"
4061,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"circle, deliberately asked a blessing of formidable length on the thin"
4062,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"bread and butter, the short cake, the marmalade, and the Pekoe tea. And"
4063,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"here, _en passant_, it may be worth while to remark, for the benefit of"
4064,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"our Agnews and Plumtres, as illustrating the intrinsic value of such"
4065,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"sanctimonious pretension, that the elder Scotland, so renowned for"
4066,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"armlong graces, and redundant preachments, and abundant psalm-singing,"
4067,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,has yet bequeathed to posterity a singularly liberal collection of
4068,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"songs, the reverie of Divine and Moral, such as “can only be sung when"
4069,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,the punch-bowl has done its work and the wild wit is set free[3].”
4070,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
4071,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"To return to my boarding-house, which with all its chairs, had none"
4072,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,appropriated to a Professor of Moral Philosophy. In the absence of
4073,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"such a monitor, nature, fortunately for myself, had gifted me with a"
4074,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"taste for reading, which the languor of ill-health, inclining me to"
4075,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"sedentary habits, helped materially to encourage. Whatever books, good,"
4076,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"bad, or indifferent, happened to come within my reach, were perused"
4077,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"with the greatest avidity, and however indiscriminate the course, the"
4078,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,balance of the impressions thence derived was decidedly in favour of
4079,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the allegorical lady, so wisely preferred by Hercules when he had"
4080,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,to make his election between Virtue and Vice. Of the material that
4081,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"ministered to this appetite, I shall always regret that I did not"
4082,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"secure, as a literary curiosity--a collection of halfpenny Ballads,"
4083,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the property of a Grocer’s apprentice, and which contained, amongst"
4084,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"other matters, a new version of Chevy Chase, wherein the victory was"
4085,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"transferred to the Scots. In the mean time, this bookishness acquired"
4086,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"for me a sort of reputation for scholarship amongst my comrades, and"
4087,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"in consequence my pen was sometimes called into requisition, in divers"
4088,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and sometimes delicate cases. Thus for one party, whom the Gods had"
4089,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"not made poetical, I composed a love-letter in verse; for another,"
4090,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"whose education had been neglected, I carried on a correspondence with"
4091,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,reference to a tobacco manufactory in which he was a sleeping partner;
4092,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"whilst, on a graver occasion, the hand now peacefully setting down"
4093,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"these reminiscences, was employed in penning a most horrible peremptory"
4094,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"invitation to pistols and twelve paces, till one was nicked. The"
4095,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"facts were briefly these. A spicy-tempered captain of Artillery, in a"
4096,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"dispute with a superior officer, had rashly cashiered himself by either"
4097,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,throwing up or tearing up his commission. In this dilemma he arrived
4098,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"at Dundee, to assume a post in the Customs, which had been procured"
4099,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"for him by the interest of his friends. To his infinite indignation,"
4100,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"however, he found that instead of a lucrative surveyorship, he had"
4101,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,been appointed a simple tide-waiter! and magnificent was the rage with
4102,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"which he tore, trampled, and danced on the little official paper book"
4103,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"wherein he had been set to tick off, bale by bale, a cargo of “infernal"
4104,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"hemp.” Unluckily, on the very day of this revelation, a forgery was"
4105,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"perpetrated on the local Bank, and those sapient Dogberries, the"
4106,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"town officers, saw fit to take up our persecuted ex-captain, on the"
4107,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,simple ground that he was the last stranger who had entered the town.
4108,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Rendered almost frantic by this second insult, nothing would serve"
4109,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"him in his paroxysm but calling somebody out, and he pitched at once"
4110,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,on the cashier of the defrauded Bank. As the state of his nerves
4111,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"would not permit him to write, he entreated me earnestly to draw up a"
4112,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"defiance, which I performed, at the expense of an agony of suppressed"
4113,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"laughter, merely to imagine the effect of such a missive on the man of"
4114,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"business--a respectable powdered, bald, pudgy, pacific little body,"
4115,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,with no more idea of “going out” than a cow in a field of clover. I
4116,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,forget the precise result--but certainly there was no duel.

4119,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"[2] The Baron Dupotet de Sennevoy and Doctor Elliotson, will"
4120,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"doubtless be glad to be informed, that the inspired Scottish"
4121,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Poet was a believer in their magnetismal mysteries--at least in
4122,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,the article of reading a book behind the back. In a letter to
4123,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Mr. Robert Ainslie, is the following passage in proof. “I have"
4124,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"no doubt but scholarcraft may be caught, as a Scotchman catches"
4125,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,the itch--by friction. How else can you account for it that born
4126,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"blockheads, by mere dint of _handling_ books, grow so wise that"
4127,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,even they themselves are equally convinced of and surprised at
4128,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"their own parts? I once carried that philosophy to that degree,"
4129,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"that in a knot of country folks, who had a library amongst them,"
4130,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and who, to the honour of their good sense, made me factotum"
4131,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"in the business; one of our members, a little wiselook, squat,"
4132,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"upright, jabbering body of a tailor, I advised him instead of"
4133,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"turning over the leaves, _to bind the book on his back_. Johnnie"
4134,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"took the hint, and as our meetings were every fourth Saturday,"
4135,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and Pricklouse having a good Scots mile to walk in coming, and"
4136,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of course another in returning, Bodkin was sure to lay his hand"
4137,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"on some heavy quarto or ponderous folio; with and under which,"
4138,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"wrapt up in his gray plaid, he grew wise as he grew weary all"
4139,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the way home. He carried this so far, that an old musty Hebrew"
4140,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Concordance, which we had in a present from a neighbouring"
4141,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"priest, _by mere dint of applying it as doctors do a blistering"
4142,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"plaster, between his shoulders_, Stitch, in a dozen pilgrimages,"
4143,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,acquired as much rational theology as the said priest had done by
4144,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,forty years’ perusal of its pages.”

4424,THE CHECK-STRING.,
4425,THE CHECK-STRING.,"THOSE who have travelled much, as inside passengers in a long"
4426,THE CHECK-STRING.,"stage-coach, whilst they admired the facility of starting off with"
4427,THE CHECK-STRING.,"one, must have occasionally remarked the difficulty of stopping with"
4428,THE CHECK-STRING.,"it, just at the point where it would be convenient to be set down."
4429,THE CHECK-STRING.,An ailing man may not have voice enough to lock all the four wheels
4430,THE CHECK-STRING.,"at once; and should he be, as is probable, a nervous man besides,"
4431,THE CHECK-STRING.,he will not without some hesitation make up his mind to request of
4432,THE CHECK-STRING.,some stentorian neighbour the loan of a set of lungs. In a six-inside
4433,THE CHECK-STRING.,"coach, the timid occupier of a middle seat has no chance whatever,"
4434,THE CHECK-STRING.,"unless to take advantage of the first casual halt, or an upset. Even"
4435,THE CHECK-STRING.,"in the four-inside vehicle, a weakly, shy traveller’s case is equally"
4436,THE CHECK-STRING.,"hopeless, supposing the passengers on the roof to have properly tucked"
4437,THE CHECK-STRING.,"up the skirts of their great and little coats. To a bold, brassy fellow"
4438,THE CHECK-STRING.,"even, with a tongue like a trumpet, it is anything but an easy affair"
4439,THE CHECK-STRING.,to say woh! with any effect to a Dart that is flying at twelve miles
4440,THE CHECK-STRING.,"within the hour. The coachman, who ought to hear, will not: the horses"
4441,THE CHECK-STRING.,hear but do not understand: the coach cannot hear: the outsiders admire
4442,THE CHECK-STRING.,the pace too much to hear anything but the patter of the hoofs. At
4443,THE CHECK-STRING.,"last, when he has succeeded, the stout gentleman with the big voice,"
4444,THE CHECK-STRING.,"who wants to run home, finds generally that he has a good hundred yards"
4445,THE CHECK-STRING.,"or two allowed him of law, measured, as the Irish always mete it out,"
4446,THE CHECK-STRING.,_backwards_.
4447,THE CHECK-STRING.,
4448,THE CHECK-STRING.,"It was after a more serious dilemma,--for a little nervous bashful"
4449,THE CHECK-STRING.,"man with a little squeaking voice like Punch’s, though he was not so"
4450,THE CHECK-STRING.,"fond of exhibiting it, after suffering himself to be carried two miles"
4451,THE CHECK-STRING.,"beyond his house, had at last fractured the small bone of his leg, by"
4452,THE CHECK-STRING.,"opening the door in despair and jumping out,--that a discussion ensued"
4453,THE CHECK-STRING.,in the Brighton “Age” as to the best means of being let out to order.
4454,THE CHECK-STRING.,Many different methods had been proposed before the little florid plump
4455,THE CHECK-STRING.,"gentleman in black delivered his opinion, with his back to the horses."
4456,THE CHECK-STRING.,
4457,THE CHECK-STRING.,"“For my own part, ratiocinating on hackney-coaches, I should"
4458,THE CHECK-STRING.,hypothetically propose check-strings.”
4459,THE CHECK-STRING.,
4460,THE CHECK-STRING.,"“Lord forbid!” exclaimed a voice from the other seat, on the same side."
4461,THE CHECK-STRING.,"Nobody remembered to have heard that voice before, from London to"
4462,THE CHECK-STRING.,Crawley Common.
4463,THE CHECK-STRING.,
4464,THE CHECK-STRING.,The friend to check-strings seemed thunderstruck by the explosion. He
4465,THE CHECK-STRING.,screwed himself round to take a look at his neighbour--didn’t like him
4466,THE CHECK-STRING.,at all--turned back again--stole another look--liked him worse than
4467,THE CHECK-STRING.,"before--then looked for the third time, and hated him. His seat became"
4468,THE CHECK-STRING.,"uneasy--he had found a choke-pear, very like a hedgehog, and very like"
4469,THE CHECK-STRING.,"a bull terrier, he could neither kill it nor let it alone. It clung to"
4470,THE CHECK-STRING.,him like a burr which you pull off your hat that it may stick on your
4471,THE CHECK-STRING.,"right-hand glove, thence to be transferred to the left-hand one, and"
4472,THE CHECK-STRING.,so on alternately till you finally get rid of it on your pantaloons.
4473,THE CHECK-STRING.,"The “Lord forbid,” like Macbeth’s “Amen,” stuck in his throat--it"
4474,THE CHECK-STRING.,"buzzed in his head like a fly in a horse’s ear. However, he held his"
4475,THE CHECK-STRING.,uncomfortable peace till silence itself became insupportable. At last
4476,THE CHECK-STRING.,he broke out:
4477,THE CHECK-STRING.,
4478,THE CHECK-STRING.,“Humph! Doubtful as I am whether common coach conversation ought to
4479,THE CHECK-STRING.,"be tied by strict rules of logic, still I cannot suppress the remark,"
4480,THE CHECK-STRING.,that when one gentleman syllogistically brings forward a proposition
4481,THE CHECK-STRING.,"of check-strings, for another gentleman to cry ‘Lord forbid,’ does"
4482,THE CHECK-STRING.,not appear to my mind to be following a regular line of argument. But
4483,THE CHECK-STRING.,perhaps the forbidding gentleman will have the goodness to explain the
4484,THE CHECK-STRING.,colloquial anomaly.”
4485,THE CHECK-STRING.,
4486,THE CHECK-STRING.,"The forbidding gentleman thus appealed to, good-humouredly apologised."
4487,THE CHECK-STRING.,"It was a mere slip of the tongue, he said: the words escaped from him"
4488,THE CHECK-STRING.,"involuntarily; but his fellow-traveller would probably excuse him, in"
4489,THE CHECK-STRING.,"consideration of the fact, that on account of a check-string he had"
4490,THE CHECK-STRING.,lost the only hope of affluence he ever had in his life.
4491,THE CHECK-STRING.,
4492,THE CHECK-STRING.,"“Indeed, Sir! why then I excuse the colloquial irregularity with all my"
4493,THE CHECK-STRING.,"heart,” said the warm man, putting both his hands into his pockets;"
4494,THE CHECK-STRING.,"“but, upon my life, Sir, it must have been a very extraordinary"
4495,THE CHECK-STRING.,consequence.”
4496,THE CHECK-STRING.,
4497,THE CHECK-STRING.,[Illustration: A CHINESE PUZZLE.]
4498,THE CHECK-STRING.,
4499,THE CHECK-STRING.,"“A very simple one, Sir,” returned the other. “The facts are briefly"
4500,THE CHECK-STRING.,these: my maternal uncle had lately returned from India with an immense
4501,THE CHECK-STRING.,"fortune, a handsome portion of which was my own in expectance, on no"
4502,THE CHECK-STRING.,worse authority than his own promise. He was a widower with an only
4503,THE CHECK-STRING.,"daughter, with whom, and himself, I one evening found myself in the"
4504,THE CHECK-STRING.,"carriage, on our way to a dinner-party given by a nobleman, then"
4505,THE CHECK-STRING.,intimately connected with East Indian affairs. We were very late:
4506,THE CHECK-STRING.,"and my uncle, the Nabob, who rode backward, was extremely fidgety,"
4507,THE CHECK-STRING.,insisting that we were going beyond our destination. Every other minute
4508,THE CHECK-STRING.,he was thrusting his head out of the front window to dispute with the
4509,THE CHECK-STRING.,"coachman, who in truth, was a little less sober, and more obstinate,"
4510,THE CHECK-STRING.,"than became him. And so we went onwards, till my uncle’s temper, always"
4511,THE CHECK-STRING.,"irritable, was worked up almost to combustion. In such moods he was"
4512,THE CHECK-STRING.,rather apt to give vent to serio-comic ebullitions; and my ill-fortune
4513,THE CHECK-STRING.,has gifted me with risible muscles of exquisite sensibility. I was
4514,THE CHECK-STRING.,"in the very midst of an ill-smothered laugh, when my fair cousin,"
4515,THE CHECK-STRING.,"giving me a sudden push, and then clasping her hands, exclaimed that"
4516,THE CHECK-STRING.,we were going past the house. I instantly jumped up and made for the
4517,THE CHECK-STRING.,"check-string, but with no more effect than if I had pulled at anything"
4518,THE CHECK-STRING.,else. Gracious Heaven! I had better have pulled the string of a
4519,THE CHECK-STRING.,"shower-bath, full of scalding hot water, to pour itself on my devoted"
4520,THE CHECK-STRING.,"head!--By that one infernal pull, Sir, I pulled myself out of half a"
4521,THE CHECK-STRING.,plum!”
4522,THE CHECK-STRING.,
4523,THE CHECK-STRING.,"“A sad pull, indeed, Sir!” said the florid plump man in black."
4524,THE CHECK-STRING.,"“But--humph--begging your pardon, Sir, I cannot really derive any such"
4525,THE CHECK-STRING.,deduction from the premises.”
4526,THE CHECK-STRING.,
4527,THE CHECK-STRING.,[Illustration: “A SPLIT WITH DUCROW.”]
4528,THE CHECK-STRING.,
4529,THE CHECK-STRING.,"“A moment’s patience, Sir,” continued the unfortunate coach-stopper."
4530,THE CHECK-STRING.,"“Lord forbid check-strings,--Lord forbid all strings whatever! I was in"
4531,THE CHECK-STRING.,"despair, Sir. I could have sunk through the bottom of the carriage!--I"
4532,THE CHECK-STRING.,believe I went down on my knees. I said everything I could think
4533,THE CHECK-STRING.,"of--and begged fifty thousand pardons, but my uncle was obdurate. ‘Pray"
4534,THE CHECK-STRING.,"don’t mention it,’ he said, in his most caustic tone--‘it has saved me"
4535,THE CHECK-STRING.,"fifty thousand pounds. It’s a very good practical joke, although it"
4536,THE CHECK-STRING.,will not read quite so well in my will.’”
4537,THE CHECK-STRING.,
4538,THE CHECK-STRING.,"“But surely, Sir,” objected the plump man, “your uncle never acted on a"
4539,THE CHECK-STRING.,"conclusion, jumped to, as I may say, by such very imperfect inferences?”"
4540,THE CHECK-STRING.,
4541,THE CHECK-STRING.,"“You did not know my uncle, Sir,” answered the unfortunate kinsman,"
4542,THE CHECK-STRING.,with a deep sigh. “But you shall judge of his character from the
4543,THE CHECK-STRING.,"clause itself:--Item, I give and bequeath to my jocose nephew, Arthur"
4544,THE CHECK-STRING.,"Carruthers Oliphant, _for pulling his uncle’s pigtail_, the sum of one"

4691,A GIPSY PARTY.,"stale, and Norwood was rejected, for the very paradoxical reason that"
4692,A GIPSY PARTY.,it was such a haunt for Gipsies; and Mrs. Carnaby meant to take even
4693,A GIPSY PARTY.,"her youngest children. After a good deal of debating, Hainault was the"
4694,A GIPSY PARTY.,"Forest fixed upon;--it lay so handy to Whitechapel, and the redletter"
4695,A GIPSY PARTY.,"day was marked to be the Wednesday in the following week, because then"
4696,A GIPSY PARTY.,Master Carnaby would only lose half a day’s schooling.
4697,A GIPSY PARTY.,
4698,A GIPSY PARTY.,"Accordingly, on the Wednesday, the Dryads of Wanstead were startled"
4699,A GIPSY PARTY.,by the rumble of a well-laden tax-cart up that avenue which once led
4700,A GIPSY PARTY.,"to a princely mansion; and the vehicle at last stopped, and set down"
4701,A GIPSY PARTY.,its insides and outsides just where the lines of trees branch off into
4702,A GIPSY PARTY.,"another verdant alley. “It was,” Mrs. Carnaby remarked, “a delicious"
4703,A GIPSY PARTY.,"green spot, and very handy to the Green Man for getting porter.” Mrs."
4704,A GIPSY PARTY.,C---- was assisted out of the cart; and then Miss C---- was lifted out
4705,A GIPSY PARTY.,by Mr. Hodges; and then the children were lifted out by the Mother; and
4706,A GIPSY PARTY.,"then the nursemaid, an awkward plainlooking girl that nobody helped,"
4707,A GIPSY PARTY.,"tumbled out. In the mean time, Master C---- jumped out, all agog after"
4708,A GIPSY PARTY.,blackberrying and birdnesting; and had swarmed half up a tree before
4709,A GIPSY PARTY.,"his mother’s vigilance discovered, at a single glance, that he was"
4710,A GIPSY PARTY.,"tearing his trowsers, and had his best clothes on. This was a bad"
4711,A GIPSY PARTY.,"setting out for the boy; and the horse was not better, for directly"
4712,A GIPSY PARTY.,"he got out of harness, and felt himself free and at grass, after two"
4713,A GIPSY PARTY.,"or three preliminary kicks and plunges, it occurred to him to indulge"
4714,A GIPSY PARTY.,"in a roll, and so he rolled over a pigeon pie that was unfortunately"
4715,A GIPSY PARTY.,"unpacked, and finished by getting very much up with his fore-legs in"
4716,A GIPSY PARTY.,"a basket of ginger beer. But it was only a moment of enthusiasm; and,"
4717,A GIPSY PARTY.,"like other old nags, he betook himself to eating his green grass salad"
4718,A GIPSY PARTY.,as gravely as a judge. None of the performers were fortunate in their
4719,A GIPSY PARTY.,"debut. The first thing Mrs. Carnaby did in her hurry to save the pop,"
4720,A GIPSY PARTY.,was to pop down one of the children on the basket of knives and forks;
4721,A GIPSY PARTY.,but it was a sharp child and soon got up again: and the first thing the
4722,A GIPSY PARTY.,"other twin did was to trip over a stump, and fall, as Betty nursemaid"
4723,A GIPSY PARTY.,"said, “with its face in a fuz.” The first thing Mr. Hodges did, was"
4724,A GIPSY PARTY.,to take Miss Carnaby round the waist and give her a smacking kiss; in
4725,A GIPSY PARTY.,"return for which, as her first act, she gave him a playful push, that"
4726,A GIPSY PARTY.,"sent him, with his white ducks, into a muddy miniature pond, that had"
4727,A GIPSY PARTY.,recently been stirred up by a cow in search of a cold bath. The first
4728,A GIPSY PARTY.,thing that Mr. C---- did was to recommend some brandy as a preventive
4729,A GIPSY PARTY.,against catching cold; but the last thing the brandy bottle had done
4730,A GIPSY PARTY.,"had been to stay at home in the cupboard. Mr. Hodges, therefore, walked"
4731,A GIPSY PARTY.,off to the Green Man for his health’s sake; and Master Carnaby sneaked
4732,A GIPSY PARTY.,"off, nobody knew where, for the sake of blackberries;--while the"
4733,A GIPSY PARTY.,"Nursemaid, for the sake of society, took a romantic walk with the two"
4734,A GIPSY PARTY.,"twins, and a strange footman. Gipsies are a wandering race, and all the"
4735,A GIPSY PARTY.,performers topped their parts; the very horse roamed away like a horse
4736,A GIPSY PARTY.,that had neither parish nor settlement: and Mr. Carnaby would have gone
4737,A GIPSY PARTY.,"roaming after him, if his Wife and Daughter had not hung round his neck"
4738,A GIPSY PARTY.,"and made him swear not to leave ’em till the others returned, which was"
4739,A GIPSY PARTY.,"afterwards softened down to taking a little walk, provided he didn’t"
4740,A GIPSY PARTY.,go out of sight and hearing. In the mean time Mrs. and Miss C---- laid
4741,A GIPSY PARTY.,"the cloth, and began to review the eatables, not without lamenting over"
4742,A GIPSY PARTY.,the smash of the pigeon pie; and when they came to plan their second
4743,A GIPSY PARTY.,"course they found that the chief remove, a cold round of beef, had been"
4744,A GIPSY PARTY.,"pinned on the way down by a favourite bull-dog, that Master Carnaby had"
4745,A GIPSY PARTY.,"smuggled into the party. Luckily for the dog, he had also gone roving,"
4746,A GIPSY PARTY.,"with the whole forest before him, as naturally as if he had belonged to"
4747,A GIPSY PARTY.,"Bampfylde Moore Carew, the King of the Gipsies."
4748,A GIPSY PARTY.,
4749,A GIPSY PARTY.,[Illustration: COIL AND RECOIL.]
4750,A GIPSY PARTY.,
4751,A GIPSY PARTY.,[Illustration: DEADLY NIGHTSHADE.]
4752,A GIPSY PARTY.,
4753,A GIPSY PARTY.,Mrs. Carnaby was one of those characters emphatically called fidgets;
4754,A GIPSY PARTY.,"she never rested till each individual came back, and she never rested"
4755,A GIPSY PARTY.,"when they did. Mr. C. was the first to return, and not in the first"
4756,A GIPSY PARTY.,of tempers. He had been done out of his long-anticipated rural walk
4757,A GIPSY PARTY.,"by setting his foot, before he had gone a hundred yards, on a yard of"
4758,A GIPSY PARTY.,"snake, and it had frightened him so that Mrs. Carnaby expected “it"
4759,A GIPSY PARTY.,"would turn his whole mash of blood, and give him the yellow jaundice.”"
4760,A GIPSY PARTY.,"Mr. Hodges came in second, but to the impatient eye of Miss C."
4761,A GIPSY PARTY.,certainly did not proceed from the Green Man with the straightness of a
4762,A GIPSY PARTY.,"bullet from a rifle. Master Carnaby was a good third, for he had been"
4763,A GIPSY PARTY.,"well horse-whipped, just as he had got three little red blackberries"
4764,A GIPSY PARTY.,"and five thorns in his fingers, by a gentleman who did not approve of"
4765,A GIPSY PARTY.,his trespassing upon his grounds. Boxer the bull-dog was fourth; he
4766,A GIPSY PARTY.,"came back on three-legs, with his brindle well peppered with number"
4767,A GIPSY PARTY.,"six by the gamekeeper, to cure him of worrying park rabbits. In fact,"
4768,A GIPSY PARTY.,"poor Boxer, as Mrs. C. exclaimed, “was bleeding like a pig,” and the"
4769,A GIPSY PARTY.,grateful animal acknowledged her compassionate notice by going and
4770,A GIPSY PARTY.,"rubbing his shot hide against her shot silk, in return for which he"
4771,A GIPSY PARTY.,got a blow quite hard enough to shiver the stick of something between
4772,A GIPSY PARTY.,a parasol and an umbrella. As for the nurse-maid and the twins they
4773,A GIPSY PARTY.,"did not return for an hour, to the infinite horror of the mother; but"
4774,A GIPSY PARTY.,just as they were all sitting down to dinner Betsey appeared with her
4775,A GIPSY PARTY.,"charge, walked off their feet, with their “pretty mouths all besmeared”"
4776,A GIPSY PARTY.,with blue and red juice; but no one of the party was botanist enough
4777,A GIPSY PARTY.,"to tell whether the berries they were munching were hips and haws, or"
4778,A GIPSY PARTY.,"bilberries, or deadly nightshade, but maternal anxiety made sure it"
4779,A GIPSY PARTY.,"was the “rank pison.” Accordingly dinner was postponed, and they set"
4780,A GIPSY PARTY.,"to get up an extempore fire to make the kettle hot, and as soon as the"
4781,A GIPSY PARTY.,"water was warm enough, these “two pretty babes” were well drenched,"
4782,A GIPSY PARTY.,and were soon as perfectly uncomfortable as they had been two months
4783,A GIPSY PARTY.,before in a rough steam trip to Margate. As soon as peace was restored
4784,A GIPSY PARTY.,"it transpired, from an examination of the children, and a very cross"
4785,A GIPSY PARTY.,"examination of the nurse-maid, that they had met with a _real_ gipsy"
4786,A GIPSY PARTY.,"woman in the forest who had told Betty’s fortune, but had omitted to"
4787,A GIPSY PARTY.,"prognosticate that her mistress would give her warning on the spot, and"
4788,A GIPSY PARTY.,"that _her_ gipsying would end, as it actually did, in finding herself"
4789,A GIPSY PARTY.,"suddenly out of place in the middle of a forest. Like other servants,"
4790,A GIPSY PARTY.,"when they lose a comfortable situation, “some natural tears she shed,”"
4791,A GIPSY PARTY.,"but did not wipe them soon, as did “our general mother,” for the very"
4792,A GIPSY PARTY.,excellent reason that she had spread her pocket handkerchief on the
4793,A GIPSY PARTY.,"ground to sit upon, somewhere between Wanstead and Walthamstow, and had"
4794,A GIPSY PARTY.,left it as a waif to the lord of the manor.
4795,A GIPSY PARTY.,
4796,A GIPSY PARTY.,[Illustration: BACKING OUT OF GOING TO MARKET.]
4797,A GIPSY PARTY.,
4798,A GIPSY PARTY.,"Dinner time then came again, to the especial delight of the two empty"
4799,A GIPSY PARTY.,"children, though, thanks to the horse and dog, it was principally"
4800,A GIPSY PARTY.,broken victuals. But on sitting down and counting heads Master C. had
4801,A GIPSY PARTY.,"a second time absconded during the last bustle; and, as his mother"
4802,A GIPSY PARTY.,"could not touch a morsel for anxiety, Mr. Carnaby was obliged to set"
4803,A GIPSY PARTY.,"out fasting to look for him, and had soon the satisfaction of finding"
4804,A GIPSY PARTY.,"him sitting hatless crying in a wet ditch, and scraping a suit of brown"
4805,A GIPSY PARTY.,"off a suit of blue with an old oyster shell. His father, in the first"
4806,A GIPSY PARTY.,"transport of anger and hunger, gave him what boys call “a regular"
4807,A GIPSY PARTY.,"larruping,” then a good rubbing down with a bunch of fern, and then"
4808,A GIPSY PARTY.,"brought him back to the cold collation, with the comfortable threat"
4809,A GIPSY PARTY.,that he should go without his dinner. As soon as the culprit could
4810,A GIPSY PARTY.,"explain for sobbing, he told them that “he had gone for a little walk,"
4811,A GIPSY PARTY.,"like, and saw the most capital donkey with a saddle and bridle feeding"
4812,A GIPSY PARTY.,"wild about the forest as if he belonged to nobody, and he just got on"
4813,A GIPSY PARTY.,"him like, like they used to do at Margate; and then the donkey set off"
4814,A GIPSY PARTY.,"full tear, and never stopped till he came to a tent of gipsies in the"
4815,A GIPSY PARTY.,"middle of the wood; and they all set upon him, and swore at him like"
4816,A GIPSY PARTY.,anything for running away with their donkey; and then all of a sudden
4817,A GIPSY PARTY.,"he lost his hat and his handkerchief, and his money out of his pockets"
4818,A GIPSY PARTY.,"like conjuring; then they told him to run for his life, and so he did,"
4819,A GIPSY PARTY.,and as for the mud it was all along of jumping over a hedge that had no
4820,A GIPSY PARTY.,other side to it.” This intelligence threw Mrs. Carnaby into an agony
4821,A GIPSY PARTY.,of horror which could only be pacified by their immediately packing up
4822,A GIPSY PARTY.,"and removing, eatables and all, to a less lonesome place by the side"
4823,A GIPSY PARTY.,"of the road, an operation that was performed by their all pulling and"
4824,A GIPSY PARTY.,"pushing at the cart, as the horse had taken French leave of absence."
4825,A GIPSY PARTY.,
4826,A GIPSY PARTY.,It was now Miss Carnaby’s turn to be discomfited: her retiring
4827,A GIPSY PARTY.,disposition made her wince under the idea of dining in public; for
4828,A GIPSY PARTY.,"being market day at Romford, they were over-looked by plenty of farmers"
4829,A GIPSY PARTY.,"and pig butchers: consequently, after a very miffy dialogue with her"
4830,A GIPSY PARTY.,"mother, the young lady took herself off, as she was desired, with “her"
4831,A GIPSY PARTY.,"romantical notions,” to a place of more solitude, and Mr. Hodges, as in"
4832,A GIPSY PARTY.,"gallantry bound, postponed his dinner till his tea to keep her company."
4833,A GIPSY PARTY.,"In the mean time, Betsey, who had been sent up to the Green Man for"
4834,A GIPSY PARTY.,"the porter, returned with the empty tankard, and a terrified tale of"
4835,A GIPSY PARTY.,"being “cotch’d hold on by a ruffian in the wood, that had drunk up all"
4836,A GIPSY PARTY.,the beer to all their very good healths.” The first impulse of Mr.
4837,A GIPSY PARTY.,"Carnaby was to jump up to do justice on the vagabond, but Mrs. C----"
4838,A GIPSY PARTY.,"had the presence of mind to catch hold of his coat-flaps so abruptly,"
4839,A GIPSY PARTY.,"that before he could well feel his legs, he found himself sitting in"
4840,A GIPSY PARTY.,"a large plum pie, which the children had just set their hearts upon;"
4841,A GIPSY PARTY.,of course it did not mend his temper to hear the shout from a dozen
4842,A GIPSY PARTY.,"ragged boys who were looking on; and in the crisis of his vexation,"
4843,A GIPSY PARTY.,"he vented such a fervent devil’s blessing on gipsy parties, and all"
4844,A GIPSY PARTY.,"that proposed them, that Mrs. Carnaby was obliged to take it up, and"
4845,A GIPSY PARTY.,"to tell him sharply, what in reality was true enough, that “if people"
4846,A GIPSY PARTY.,"did have gipsy parties, it didn’t follow that their stupid husbands"
4847,A GIPSY PARTY.,was to sit down on plum pies.” Heaven knows to what size and shape
4848,A GIPSY PARTY.,"this little quarrel might have ripened, but for the appearance of Miss"
4849,A GIPSY PARTY.,"Carnaby, who, with a terrified exclamation sat herself down, and after"
4850,A GIPSY PARTY.,"a vain attempt to recover, went off into a strong fit of what her"
4851,A GIPSY PARTY.,mother called “kicking hysterics.” The cause was soon explained by the
4852,A GIPSY PARTY.,"appearance of Mr. Hodges, with one eye poached black, and a dog-bite"
4853,A GIPSY PARTY.,"in the calf of his leg, because “he had only stood looking on at two"
4854,A GIPSY PARTY.,"men setting wires for rabbits, thinking to himself if he watched them"
4855,A GIPSY PARTY.,"well he could learn how to do it.” Fortunately, Miss Carnaby came to"
4856,A GIPSY PARTY.,"just in time to concur with her father and Mr. Hodges in the opinion,"
4857,A GIPSY PARTY.,"that the best thing they could all do was to pack up and go home, but"
4858,A GIPSY PARTY.,"which was stoutly combated by Mrs. Carnaby, who insisted that she"
4859,A GIPSY PARTY.,"was resolved to take tea in a wood for once in her life, and she was"
4860,A GIPSY PARTY.,"seconded by the children and Master C----, who said they hadn’t had any"
4861,A GIPSY PARTY.,"pleasure yet. It was an unanswerable argument; sticks were collected,"
4862,A GIPSY PARTY.,"a fire was made, the kettle boiled, the tea-things were set in order,"
4863,A GIPSY PARTY.,"the bread and butter was cut, and pleasure began to smile on the gipsy"
4864,A GIPSY PARTY.,party so placidly that Mr. Hodges was encouraged to begin playing “In
4865,A GIPSY PARTY.,"my Cottage near a Wood,” on the key bugle, but was obliged to break"
4866,A GIPSY PARTY.,"off in the middle, on finding that it acted as a bugle call to a corps"
4867,A GIPSY PARTY.,"of observation, who came and stood round to see “Rural Felicity.”"
4868,A GIPSY PARTY.,"Mrs. Carnaby, however, was happy; but “there is many a slip between"
4869,A GIPSY PARTY.,the tea-cup and the lip.” She was in the triumphant fact of pouring
4870,A GIPSY PARTY.,"the hot water on her best souchong, in her best china tea-pot, when"
4871,A GIPSY PARTY.,a very well-charged gun went off just on the other side of the park
4872,A GIPSY PARTY.,"palings, and Mrs. Carnaby had not been born like her Grace, old Sarah"
4873,A GIPSY PARTY.,"of Marlborough, “before nerves came in fashion.” The tea-kettle dropped"
4874,A GIPSY PARTY.,"from her hand upon the tea-pot, which it dashed to atoms, and then lay"
4875,A GIPSY PARTY.,"on its side, hot watering the daisies and the dandelions that had the"
4876,A GIPSY PARTY.,"luck to grow near it. “Misfortunes never come single,” and the gun,"
4877,A GIPSY PARTY.,"therefore, acted like a double one in its inflictions; for no sooner"
4878,A GIPSY PARTY.,"did Boxer recognise its sound than he jumped up, and with an alarming"
4879,A GIPSY PARTY.,"howl dashed through the rest of the tea service, as if he had absorbed"
4880,A GIPSY PARTY.,another ounce of number six: a fresh shout from the bystanders welcomed
4881,A GIPSY PARTY.,"this new disaster, and with the true spirit of “biting a bitten cur,”"
4882,A GIPSY PARTY.,they began to heap embarrassments on the disconcerted gipsyers. They
4883,A GIPSY PARTY.,"kept pitching sticks into the fire till it grew a bonfire, and made"
4884,A GIPSY PARTY.,cockshies of the remaining crockery; some audacious boys even helped
4885,A GIPSY PARTY.,"themselves to bread and butter, as if on the principle that the open"
4886,A GIPSY PARTY.,air ought to keep open house. As there were too many assailants to
4887,A GIPSY PARTY.,"chastise, the only remedy was to pack up and take to the road as"
4888,A GIPSY PARTY.,"fast as they could, with a horse which they found with two broken"
4889,A GIPSY PARTY.,"knees, the consequence of his being too curious in the construction"
4890,A GIPSY PARTY.,"of a gravel-pit. “You may say what you like,” said Mr. Carnaby, in"
4891,A GIPSY PARTY.,"his summing up, “but for my part I must say of gipsying, that it’s"
4892,A GIPSY PARTY.,impossible to take to it without being regularly ‘done brown.’”

5070,"DEAR DICK,","attorneys, offered three years ago, and continued the allowance"
5071,"DEAR DICK,","up to last Easter Term, to give me, with unexampled liberality,"
5072,"DEAR DICK,","eighteen shillings per week as copying clerk, and to undertake the"
5073,"DEAR DICK,",management of the Common Law--attend to the Chancery Department--do the
5074,"DEAR DICK,",out-door business--make out Bills of Costs--and make myself generally
5075,"DEAR DICK,",useful--which I have been doing as long as my health permitted. Not
5076,"DEAR DICK,","being strong, though with an attachment to the profession, I have been"
5077,"DEAR DICK,","compelled to withdraw my record, and to sue out a Writ of Certiorari to"
5078,"DEAR DICK,",carry my line of life into another court. Hearing that Don Pedro was
5079,"DEAR DICK,","about to bring an action against Don Miguel and Company, and that lots"
5080,"DEAR DICK,","of John Does and Richard Roes were wanted, I took a retainer from an"
5081,"DEAR DICK,","agent of the great Portuguese professional gentleman, and have really"
5082,"DEAR DICK,","embarked in the cause. Being out here on the circuit, as one might call"
5083,"DEAR DICK,","it (Mr. Chief Justice Sartorius goes it), and knowing the interest you"
5084,"DEAR DICK,","take in my verdicts, I shall write at intervals the particulars of"
5085,"DEAR DICK,","plaintiff’s demand, and account of set-off on the part of the enemy’s"
5086,"DEAR DICK,","fleet, or Defendant. Pray call on Mr. Wilson, the Common Law Clerk at"
5087,"DEAR DICK,","Pike, Row, and Co., and tell him I have four hours to myself and a"
5088,"DEAR DICK,","chance of being paid, but do this if possible without the knowledge of"
5089,"DEAR DICK,","the Principals. White of the same office, when I enlisted, was to have"
5090,"DEAR DICK,","taken the benefit of the act, but on mustering at Gravesend, he did not"
5091,"DEAR DICK,","attend the roll call, and was struck off the Rolls. I can’t but say,"
5092,"DEAR DICK,","putting Truth on her oath in the Admiralty Court, that when the Blue"
5093,"DEAR DICK,","Peter gave legal notice to quit, I felt some regret at leaving a land"
5094,"DEAR DICK,","where I might have been, so to speak, a tenant at will. Nor was it much"
5095,"DEAR DICK,","better when I came to the Nore. I heartily wished, with Mr. Matthews,"
5096,"DEAR DICK,","that if Britannia does rule the waves, she would rule them evener! but"
5097,"DEAR DICK,","it was “rule refused.” The sea ran very rough, and you will understand"
5098,"DEAR DICK,",me when I say I took nothing by my motion. There was the thought of my
5099,"DEAR DICK,","mother, besides, and the numberless feelings for which, though matters"

5101,"DEAR DICK,",
5102,"DEAR DICK,","You remember Sugden with Hart & Co., and will not be surprised to hear"
5103,"DEAR DICK,",that he volunteered to convince Don Miguel of his defective title.
5104,"DEAR DICK,","A few hours, however, sufficed to disgust him with conveyancing, as"
5105,"DEAR DICK,","it is practised in the Marine Courts; and I heard him, by a verbal"
5106,"DEAR DICK,","instrument, assign over with technical formality, the whole ship to the"
5107,"DEAR DICK,","Devil, his Heirs, Executors, Administrators, and Assigns."
5108,"DEAR DICK,",
5109,"DEAR DICK,","As for Butterworth, the Captain gave instructions with regard to the"

5111,"DEAR DICK,","some time that he was dead, but after rubbing, and other means of"
5112,"DEAR DICK,","revival, we had the satisfaction of seeing him moving for a new trial,"

5145,"DEAR DICK,",agreed to withdraw a juror.
5146,"DEAR DICK,",

5533,THE SUB-MARINE.,"With captains of renown,"

5541,THE SUB-MARINE.,"His trousers were so wide and blue,"

5543,THE SUB-MARINE.,
5544,THE SUB-MARINE.,"He put the rummer to his lips,"
5545,THE SUB-MARINE.,And drank a jolly draught;
5546,THE SUB-MARINE.,He raised the rummer many times--

5553,THE SUB-MARINE.,"It gave a lurch and down he went,"

5563,THE SUB-MARINE.,To see where he arrived!
5564,THE SUB-MARINE.,
5565,THE SUB-MARINE.,"And all that he could see was green,"
5566,THE SUB-MARINE.,Sea-green on every hand!
5567,THE SUB-MARINE.,"And then he tried to sound beneath,"

5572,THE SUB-MARINE.,And lo! above his head there bent
5573,THE SUB-MARINE.,A strange and staring lass;
5574,THE SUB-MARINE.,"One hand was in her yellow hair,"

5576,THE SUB-MARINE.,A mermaid she must surely be

5589,THE SUB-MARINE.,"For mariners to rue,--"
5590,THE SUB-MARINE.,"But when he saw her lips apart,"

5592,THE SUB-MARINE.,
5593,THE SUB-MARINE.,With either hand he stopp’d his ears
5594,THE SUB-MARINE.,Against her evil cry;
5595,THE SUB-MARINE.,"Alas, alas, for all his care,"
5596,THE SUB-MARINE.,"His doom it seem’d to die,"
5597,THE SUB-MARINE.,Her voice went ringing through his head
5598,THE SUB-MARINE.,It was so sharp and high!
5599,THE SUB-MARINE.,
5600,THE SUB-MARINE.,He thrust his fingers farther in
5601,THE SUB-MARINE.,"At each unwilling ear,"
5602,THE SUB-MARINE.,But still in very spite of all
5603,THE SUB-MARINE.,The words were plain and clear;
5604,THE SUB-MARINE.,"“I can’t stand here the whole day long,"
5605,THE SUB-MARINE.,To hold your glass of beer!”
5606,THE SUB-MARINE.,
5607,THE SUB-MARINE.,"With open’d mouth and open’d eyes,"
5608,THE SUB-MARINE.,"Up rose the sub-marine,"
5609,THE SUB-MARINE.,And gave a stare to find the sands
5610,THE SUB-MARINE.,And deeps where he had been:
5611,THE SUB-MARINE.,There was no siren with her glass!
5612,THE SUB-MARINE.,No waters ocean-green!

5614,THE SUB-MARINE.,The wet deception from his eyes
5615,THE SUB-MARINE.,"Kept fading more and more,"
5616,THE SUB-MARINE.,He only saw the bar-maid stand

5631,THE ISLAND.,“Oh had I some sweet little Isle of my own!”--MOORE.
5632,THE ISLAND.,
5633,THE ISLAND.,
5634,THE ISLAND.,IF the author of the Irish Melodies had ever had a little Isle so much
5635,THE ISLAND.,"his own as I have possessed, he might not have found it so sweet as the"
5636,THE ISLAND.,"song anticipates. It has been my fortune, like Robinson Crusoe, and"
5637,THE ISLAND.,"Alexander Selkirk, to be thrown on such a desolate spot, and I felt so"
5638,THE ISLAND.,"lonely, though I had a follower, that I wish Moore had been there. I"
5639,THE ISLAND.,"had the honour of being in that tremendous action off Finisterre, which"
5640,THE ISLAND.,proved an end of the earth to many a brave fellow. I was ordered with
5641,THE ISLAND.,"a boarding party to forcibly enter the Santissima Trinidada, but in"
5642,THE ISLAND.,"the act of climbing into the quarter-gallery, which, however, gave no"
5643,THE ISLAND.,"quarter, was rebutted by the butt-end of a marine’s gun, who remained"
5644,THE ISLAND.,"the quarter-master of the place. I fell senseless into the sea, and"
5645,THE ISLAND.,"should no doubt have perished in the waters of oblivion, but for the"
5646,THE ISLAND.,"kindness of John Monday, who picked me up to go adrift with him in one"
5647,THE ISLAND.,"of the ship’s boats. All our oars were carried away, that is to say we"
5648,THE ISLAND.,"did not carry away any oars, and while shot was raining, our feeble"
5649,THE ISLAND.,"hailing was unheeded. In short, as Shakspeare says, we were drifting"
5650,THE ISLAND.,"off by “the current of a heady fight.” As may be supposed, our boat was"
5651,THE ISLAND.,"anything but the jolly-boat, for we had no provisions to spare in the"
5652,THE ISLAND.,"middle of an immense waste. We were, in fact, adrift in the cutter with"
5653,THE ISLAND.,"nothing to cut. We had not even junk for junketing, and nothing but"
5654,THE ISLAND.,"salt-water, even if the wind should blow fresh. Famine indeed seemed to"
5655,THE ISLAND.,stare each of us in the ace; that is we stared at one another; but if
5656,THE ISLAND.,"men turn cannibals, a great allowance must be made for a short ditto."
5657,THE ISLAND.,"We were truly in a very disagreeable pickle, with oceans of brine and"
5658,THE ISLAND.,"no beef, and, like Shylock, I fancy we would have exchanged a pound of"
5659,THE ISLAND.,"gold for a pound of flesh. The more we drifted Nor, the more sharply we"
5660,THE ISLAND.,"inclined to gnaw,--but when we drifted Sow, we found nothing like pork."
5661,THE ISLAND.,"No bread rose in the east, and in the opposite point we were equally"
5662,THE ISLAND.,"disappointed. We could not compass a meal anyhow, but got mealy-mouth’d"
5663,THE ISLAND.,"notwithstanding. We could see the Sea mews to the eastward, flying over"
5664,THE ISLAND.,"what Byron calls the Gardens of Gull. We saw plenty of Grampus, but"
5665,THE ISLAND.,"they were useless to all intents and porpusses, and we had no bait for"
5666,THE ISLAND.,catching a bottle-nose.

5672,THE ISLAND.,"Time hung heavily on our hands, for our fast days seemed to pass very"
5673,THE ISLAND.,"slowly, and our strength was rapidly sinking from being so much afloat."
5674,THE ISLAND.,"Still we nourished Hope, though we had nothing to give her. But at last"
5675,THE ISLAND.,"we lost all prospect of land, if one may so say when no land was in"
5676,THE ISLAND.,sight. The weather got thicker as we were getting thinner; and though
5677,THE ISLAND.,"we kept a sharp watch, it was a very bad look-out. We could see nothing"
5678,THE ISLAND.,"before us but nothing to eat and drink. At last the fog cleared off,"
5679,THE ISLAND.,"and we saw something like land right a-head, but alas, the wind was"
5680,THE ISLAND.,in our teeth as well as in our stomachs. We could do nothing but keep
5681,THE ISLAND.,"her near, and as we could not keep ourselves full, we luckily suited"
5682,THE ISLAND.,the course of the boat; so that after a tedious beating about--for
5683,THE ISLAND.,"the wind not only gives blows, but takes a great deal of beating--we"
5684,THE ISLAND.,"came incontinently to an island. Here we landed, and our first impulse"
5685,THE ISLAND.,on coming to dry land was to drink. There was a little brook at hand
5686,THE ISLAND.,to which we applied ourselves till it seemed actually to murmur at
5687,THE ISLAND.,"our inordinate thirst. Our next care was to look for some food, for"
5688,THE ISLAND.,"though our hearts were full at our escape, the neighbouring region was"
5689,THE ISLAND.,dreadfully empty. We succeeded in getting some natives out of their
5690,THE ISLAND.,"bed, and ate them, poor things, as fast as they got up, but with some"
5691,THE ISLAND.,difficulty in getting them open; a common oyster-knife would have been
5692,THE ISLAND.,worth the price of a sceptre. Our next concern was to look out for a
5693,THE ISLAND.,"lodging, and at last we discovered an empty cave, reminding me of an"
5694,THE ISLAND.,"old inscription at Portsmouth, “The whole of this place to let.” We"
5695,THE ISLAND.,"took the precaution of rolling some great stones to the entrance, for"
5696,THE ISLAND.,"fear of last lodgers,--that some bear might come home from business,"
5697,THE ISLAND.,"or a tiger to tea. Here, under the rock, we slept without rocking,"
5698,THE ISLAND.,"and when, through the night’s failing, the day broke, we saw with the"
5699,THE ISLAND.,"first instalment of light that we were upon a small desert isle, now"
5700,THE ISLAND.,"for the first time an Isle of Man. Accordingly, the birds in this wild"
5701,THE ISLAND.,"solitude were so little wild, that a number of boobies and noddies"
5702,THE ISLAND.,"allowed themselves to be taken by hand, though the asses were not such"
5703,THE ISLAND.,"asses as to be caught. There was an abundance of rabbits, which we"
5704,THE ISLAND.,"chased unremittingly, as Hunt runs Warren; and when coats and trousers"
5705,THE ISLAND.,"fell short, we clothed our skins with theirs, till, as Monday said,"
5706,THE ISLAND.,"we each represented a burrow. In this work Monday was the tailor, for"
5707,THE ISLAND.,"like the maker of shadowy rabbits and cocks upon the wall, he could"
5708,THE ISLAND.,"turn his hand to anything. He became a potter, a carpenter, a butcher,"
5709,THE ISLAND.,"and a baker--that is to say, a master butcher and a master baker, for"
5710,THE ISLAND.,"I became merely his journeyman. Reduced to a state of nature, Monday’s"
5711,THE ISLAND.,"favourite phrase for our condition, I found my being an officer"
5712,THE ISLAND.,"fulfilled no office; to confess the truth, I made a very poor sort of"
5713,THE ISLAND.,"savage, whereas Monday, I am persuaded, would have been made a chief by"
5714,THE ISLAND.,any tribe whatever. Our situations in life were completely reversed;
5715,THE ISLAND.,"he became the leader and I the follower, or rather, to do justice to"
5716,THE ISLAND.,"his attachment and ability, he became like a strong big brother to a"
5717,THE ISLAND.,helpless little one.
5718,THE ISLAND.,
5719,THE ISLAND.,[Illustration: IN EMBARRASSED CIRCUMSTANCES.]
5720,THE ISLAND.,
5721,THE ISLAND.,"We remained in a state of nature five years, when at last a whaler of"
5722,THE ISLAND.,"Hull--though the hull was not visible--showed her masts on the horizon,"
5723,THE ISLAND.,"an event which was telegraphed by Monday, who began saying his prayers"
5724,THE ISLAND.,and dancing the College Hornpipe at the same time with equal fervour.
5725,THE ISLAND.,"We contrived by lighting a fire, literally a _feu-de-joie_, to make a"
5726,THE ISLAND.,"sign of distress, and a boat came to our signal deliverance. We had a"
5727,THE ISLAND.,"prosperous passage home, where the reader may anticipate the happiness"
5728,THE ISLAND.,that awaited us; but not the trouble that was in store for me and
5729,THE ISLAND.,Monday. Our parting was out of the question; we would both rather have
5730,THE ISLAND.,parted from our sheet anchor. We attempted to return to our relative
5731,THE ISLAND.,"rank, but we had lived so long in a kind of liberty and equality,"
5732,THE ISLAND.,that we could never resume our grades. The state of nature remained
5733,THE ISLAND.,"uppermost with us both, and Monday still watched over and tended me"
5734,THE ISLAND.,"like Dominie Sampson with the boy Harry Bertram; go where I would, he"
5735,THE ISLAND.,"followed with the dogged pertinacity of Tom Pipes; and do what I might,"
5736,THE ISLAND.,he interfered with the resolute vigour of John Dory in Wild Oats. This
5737,THE ISLAND.,"disposition involved us daily, nay, hourly, in the most embarrassing"
5738,THE ISLAND.,"circumstances; and how the connexion might have terminated I know not,"
5739,THE ISLAND.,if it had not been speedily dissolved in a very unexpected manner. One
5740,THE ISLAND.,"morning poor Monday was found on his bed in a sort of convulsion, which"
5741,THE ISLAND.,"barely enabled him to grasp my hand, and to falter out, “Good-bye, I am"
5742,THE ISLAND.,go--going--back--to a state of nature.”

6008,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"personages, apparently grandfathers and grandmothers, were simply"
6009,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,great uncles and aunts: and finally I enjoyed an interview with a
6010,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"relative oftener heard of traditionally, than encountered in the"
6011,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,body--a great-great grandmother--still a tall woman and a tolerable
6012,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"pedestrian, going indeed down the hill, but with the wheel well"
6013,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"locked. It was like coming amongst the Struldbrugs; and truly, for any"
6014,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"knowledge to the contrary, many of these Old Mortalities are still"
6015,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"living, enjoying their sneeshing, their toddy, their cracks, and"
6016,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"particular reminiscences. The very phrase of being “Scotch’d, but not"
6017,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"killed,” seems to refer to this Caledonian tenacity of life, of which"
6018,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,the well-known Walking Stewart was an example: he was an annuitant in
6019,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the County-office, and as the actuaries would say, died very hard. It"
6020,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,must be difficult for the teatotallers to reconcile this longevity with
6021,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,the imputed enormous consumption of ardent spirits beyond the Tweed.
6022,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Scotia, according to the evidence of Mr. Buckingham’s committee, is an"
6023,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"especially drouthie bodie, who drinks whiskey at christenings, and at"
6024,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"buryings, and on all possible occasions besides. Her sons drink not by"
6025,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the hour or by the day, but by the week,--witness Souter Johnny:--"
6026,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
6027,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"“Tam lo’ed him like a vera brither,"
6028,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,They had been fou for weeks thegither.”
6029,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
6030,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Swallowing no thin washy potation, but a strong overproof spirit,"
6031,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"with a smack of smoke--and “where there is smoke there is fire,” yet"
6032,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"without flashing off, according to temperance theories, by spontaneous"
6033,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"combustion. On the contrary, the canny northerns are noted for"
6034,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"soundness of constitution and clearness of head, with such a strong"
6035,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"principle of vitality as to justify the poetical prediction of C***,"
6036,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"that the world’s longest liver, or Last Man, will be a Scotchman."
6037,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
6038,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,All these favourable signs I duly noted; and prophetically refrained
6039,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"from delivering the letter of introduction to Doctor C----, which was"
6040,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"to place me under his medical care. As the sick man said, when he"
6041,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"went into the gin-shop instead of the hospital, I “trusted to natur.”"
6042,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Whenever the weather permitted, therefore, which was generally when"
6043,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"there were no new books to the fore, I haunted the banks and braes, or"
6044,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"paid flying visits to the burns, with a rod intended to punish that"
6045,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,rising generation amongst fishes called trout. But I whipped in vain.
6046,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Trout there were in plenty, but like obstinate double teeth, with a bad"
6047,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"operator, they would neither be pulled out nor come out of themselves."
6048,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Still the sport, if so it might be called, had its own attractions, as,"
6049,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the catching excepted, the whole of the Waltonish enjoyments were at"
6050,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"my command, the contemplative quiet, the sweet wholesome country air,"
6051,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,and the picturesque scenery--not to forget the relishing the homely
6052,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"repast at the shealing or the mill; sometimes I went alone, but often"
6053,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"we were a company, and then we had for our attendant a journeyman"
6054,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"tobacco-spinner, an original, and literary withal, for he had a reel in"
6055,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"his head, whence ever and anon he unwound a line of Allan Ramsay, or"
6056,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Beattie, or Burns. Methinks I still listen, trudging homewards in the"
6057,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"gloaming, to the recitation of that appropriate stanza, beginning--"
6058,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
6059,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"“At the close of the day when the hamlet was still,”"
6060,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
6061,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,delivered with a gusto perhaps only to be felt by a day-labouring
6062,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"mechanic, who had “nothing but his evenings to himself.” Methinks I"
6063,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,still sympathise with the zest with which he dwelt on the pastoral
6064,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"images and dreams so rarely realised, when a chance holiday gave"
6065,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,him the fresh-breathing fragrance of the living flower in lieu
6066,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,of the stale odour of the Indian weed; and philosophically I can
6067,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"now understand why poetry, with its lofty aspirations and sublimed"
6068,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"feelings, seemed to sound so gratefully to the ear from the lips of"
6069,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,a “squire of low degree.” There is something painful and humiliating
6070,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"to humanity in the abjectness of mind, that too often accompanies the"
6071,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,sordid condition of the working classes; whereas it is soothing and
6072,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,consolatory to find the mind of the poor man rising superior to his
6073,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"estate, and compensating by intellectual enjoyment for the physical"
6074,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,pains and privation that belong to his humble lot. Whatever raises
6075,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"him above the level of the ox in the garner, or the horse in the"
6076,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"mill, ought to be acceptable to the pride, if not to the charity, of"
6077,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the fellow creature that calls him brother; for instance, music and"
6078,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"dancing, but against which innocent unbendings some of our magistracy"
6079,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"persist in setting their faces, as if resolved that a low neighbourhood"
6080,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"should enjoy no dance but St. Vitus’s, and no fiddle but the Scotch."
6081,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
6082,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"To these open-air pursuits, sailing was afterwards added, bringing"
6083,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"me acquainted with the boatmen and fishermen of The Craig, a hardy"
6084,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"race, rough and ready-witted, from whom perchance was first derived my"
6085,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"partiality for all marine bipeds and sea-craft, from Flag Admirals down"
6086,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"to Jack Junk, the proud first-rate to the humble boatie that “wins the"
6087,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"bairns’ bread.” The Tay at Dundee is a broad noble river, with a racing"
6088,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"tide, which, when it differs with a contrary wind, will get up “_jars_”"
6089,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,(Anglicè waves) quite equal to those of a family manufacture. It was
6090,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,at least a good preparatory school for learning the rudiments of boat
6091,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,craft; whereof I acquired enough to be able at need to take the helm
6092,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,without either going too near the wind or too distant from the port.
6093,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Not without some boyish pride I occasionally found myself intrusted
6094,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,with the guidance of the Coach-Boat--so called from its carrying the
6095,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"passengers by the Edinburgh Mail--particularly in a calm, when the"
6096,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"utmost exertions of the crew, four old man-of-war’s-men, were required"
6097,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"at the oars. It not unfrequently happened, however, that “the laddie”"
6098,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"was unceremoniously ousted by the unanimous vote, and sometimes by the"
6099,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"united strength, of the ladies, who invariably pitched upon the oldest"
6100,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,old gentleman in the vessel to
6101,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
6102,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,“_Steer_ her up and haud her gaun.”
6103,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
6104,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"The consequence being the landing with all the baggage, some half-mile"
6105,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"above or below the town--and a too late conviction, that the _Elder_"
6106,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Brethren of our Trinity House were not the best Pilots.
6107,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
6108,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"It was during one of these brief voyages, that I witnessed a"
6109,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"serio-comic accident, at which the reader will smile or sigh according"
6110,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,to his connexion with the Corporation of London. I forget on what
6111,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"unconscious pilgrimage it was bound, but amongst the other passengers"
6112,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"one day, there was that stock-dove of a gourmand’s affection, a five"
6113,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"lively turtle. Rich and rare as it was, it did not travel unprotected"
6114,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"like Moore’s heroine, but was under the care of a vigilant guardian,"
6115,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"who seemed as jealous of the eyes that looked amorously at his charge,"
6116,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"as if the latter had been a ward in Chancery. So far--namely, as far"
6117,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"as the middle of the Tay--so good; when the spirit of mischief, or"
6118,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"curiosity, or humanity, suggested the convenience of a sea-bath, and"
6119,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,the refreshment the creature might derive from a taste of its native
6120,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"element. Accordingly, Testudo was lifted over the side, and indulged"
6121,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"with a dip and a wallop in the wave, which actually revived it so"
6122,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"powerfully, that from a playful flapping with its fore-fins it soon"
6123,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"began to struggle most vigorously, like a giant refreshed with brine."
6124,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"In fact, it paddled with a power which, added to its weight, left no"
6125,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"alternative to its guardian but to go with it, or without it. The event"
6126,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"soon came off. The man tumbled backward into the boat, and the turtle"
6127,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,plunged forward into the deep. There was a splash--a momentary glimpse
6128,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of the broad back-shell--the waters closed, and all was over--or"
6129,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,at least under! In vain one of the boatmen aimed a lunge with his
6130,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"boat-hook, at the fatal spot in particular--in vain another made a blow"
6131,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"with his oar at the Tay in general--whilst a third, in his confusion,"
6132,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"heaved a coil of rope, as he would, could, should, might, or ought to"
6133,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,have done to a drowning Christian. The Amphibious was beyond their
6134,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"reach, and no doubt, making westward and homeward with all its might,"
6135,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,with an instinctive feeling that
6136,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
6137,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,“The world was all before it where to choose
6138,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Its place of rest, and Providence its guide.”"
6139,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
6140,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Never shall I forget, whilst capable of reminiscences, the face of that"
6141,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,mourning mate thus suddenly bereaved of his turtle! The unfortunate
6142,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"shepherd, Ding-dog, in Rabelais, could hardly have looked more utterly"
6143,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and unutterably dozed, crazed, mizmazed, and flabbergasted, when his"
6144,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,whole flock and stock of golden-fleeced sheep suicidically sheepwashed
6145,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"themselves to death, by wilfully leaping over-board! He said little"
6146,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"in words, but more eloquently clapped his hands to his waistcoat, as"
6147,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"if the loss, as the nurses say, had literally “flown to his stomach.”"
6148,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"And truly, after promising it both callipash and callipee, with the"
6149,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"delicious green fat to boot, what cold comfort could well be colder"

6163,CHAPTER I.,
6164,CHAPTER I.,"As Madame Doppeldick said this, she thrust both her fat hands into"
6165,CHAPTER I.,"the pockets of her scarlet cotton apron, at the same time giving her"
6166,CHAPTER I.,"head a gentle shake, as if implying that it was a case in which heads"
6167,CHAPTER I.,and hands could be of no possible avail. She was standing in a little
6168,CHAPTER I.,"dormitory, exactly equidistant from two beds, between which her eyes"
6169,CHAPTER I.,and her thoughts had been alternating some ten minutes past. They were
6170,CHAPTER I.,"small beds,--pallets,--cots,--cribs, troughs upon four legs, such"
6171,CHAPTER I.,as the old painters represent the manger in their pictures of the
6172,CHAPTER I.,"Nativity. Our German beds are not intended to carry double, and in such"
6173,CHAPTER I.,"an obscure out-of-the way village as Kleinewinkel, who would think of"
6174,CHAPTER I.,finding any thing better in the way of a couch than a sort of box just
6175,CHAPTER I.,"too little for a bed, and just too large for a coffin? It was between"
6176,CHAPTER I.,"two such bedlings, then, that Madame Doppeldick was standing, when she"
6177,CHAPTER I.,broke out into the aforesaid exclamation--“I am perfectly at my wits’
6178,CHAPTER I.,ends!”
6179,CHAPTER I.,
6180,CHAPTER I.,"Now, the wits’ ends of Madame Doppeldick scarcely extended farther"
6181,CHAPTER I.,from her scull than the horns of a snail. They seldom protruded far
6182,CHAPTER I.,"beyond her nose, and that was a short one; and moreover they were apt"
6183,CHAPTER I.,"to recede and draw in from the first obstacle they encountered, leaving"
6184,CHAPTER I.,"their proprietor to feel her own way, as if she had no wits’ ends at"
6185,CHAPTER I.,"all. Thus, having satisfied themselves that there were only two beds"
6186,CHAPTER I.,"in the rooms, they left the poor lady in the lurch, and absolutely"
6187,CHAPTER I.,"at a nonplus, as to how she was to provide for the accommodation of a"
6188,CHAPTER I.,"third sleeper, who was expected to arrive the same evening. There was"
6189,CHAPTER I.,"only one best bed-room in the house, and it happened to be the worst"
6190,CHAPTER I.,"bed-room also; all for Gretchen, the maid-servant, went home nightly to"
6191,CHAPTER I.,sleep at her mother’s. To be sure a shake-down might be spread in the
6192,CHAPTER I.,parlour; but to be sure the parlour was also a shop of all sorts; and
6193,CHAPTER I.,to be sure the young officer would object to such accommodations; and
6194,CHAPTER I.,"to be very sure, Mr. Doppeldick would object equally to the shake-down,"
6195,CHAPTER I.,and giving up the two beds overhead to his wife and the young officer.
6196,CHAPTER I.,
6197,CHAPTER I.,"“God forgive me,” said the perplexed Madame Doppeldick as she went"
6198,CHAPTER I.,slowly down the stairs;--“but I wish Captain Schenk had been killed at
6199,CHAPTER I.,"the battle of Leipzig, or had got a bed of glory anywhere else, before"
6200,CHAPTER I.,he came to be billeted on us!”

6206,CHAPTER II.,
6207,CHAPTER II.,IN extenuation of so unchristian-like an aspiration as the one which
6208,CHAPTER II.,escaped from the lips of Madame Doppeldick at the end of the last
6209,CHAPTER II.,"chapter, it must be remembered that she was a woman of great delicacy"
6210,CHAPTER II.,"for her size. She was so corpulent, that she might safely have gone to"
6211,CHAPTER II.,"court without a hoop, her arms were too big for legs; and as for her"
6212,CHAPTER II.,"legs, it passed for a miracle of industry, even amongst the laborious"
6213,CHAPTER II.,"hard-working inhabitants of Kleinewinkel, that she knitted her own"
6214,CHAPTER II.,"stockings. It must be confessed, that she ate heartily, drank heartily,"
6215,CHAPTER II.,"and slept heartily; and all she ate, drank, and slept, seemed to do her"
6216,CHAPTER II.,"good, for she never ceased growing, at least horizontally, till she"
6217,CHAPTER II.,"did ample justice to the name which became her own by marriage. Still,"
6218,CHAPTER II.,"as the bulk of her body increased, the native shrinking, unobtrusive"
6219,CHAPTER II.,modesty of her mind remained the same; or rather it became even more
6220,CHAPTER II.,"tremulously sensitive. In spite of her huge dimensions, she seemed to"
6221,CHAPTER II.,entertain the Utopian desire of being seen by no eyes save those of
6222,CHAPTER II.,her husband; of passing through life unnoticed and unknown; in short
6223,CHAPTER II.,she was a globe-peony with the feelings of a violet. Judge then what
6224,CHAPTER II.,a shock her blushing sensibilities received from the mere idea of the
6225,CHAPTER II.,strange captain intruding on the shadiest haunts of domestic privacy!
6226,CHAPTER II.,"Although by birth, education, and disposition, as loyal as the"
6227,CHAPTER II.,"sunflower to the sun, in the first rash transports of her trepidation"
6228,CHAPTER II.,and vexation she wished anything but well to her liege sovereign the
6229,CHAPTER II.,King of Prussia--wondering bitterly why his majesty could not contrive
6230,CHAPTER II.,to have his reviews and sham-fights in Berlin itself; or at least in
6231,CHAPTER II.,"Posen, where there were spare beds to be had, and lodgings to let for"
6232,CHAPTER II.,"single men. Then again, if the Quarter-master had but condescended"
6233,CHAPTER II.,"to give a quarter’s notice, why, Mr. Doppeldick might have run up"
6234,CHAPTER II.,"an extra room, or they might have parted off a portion of their own"
6235,CHAPTER II.,chamber with lath and plaster--or they might have done a thousand
6236,CHAPTER II.,"things; for instance, they might have sold their house and left the"
6237,CHAPTER II.,"country, instead of being thus taken unawares in their own sanctorum"
6238,CHAPTER II.,"by a strange gentleman, as suddenly as if he had tumbled through the"
6239,CHAPTER II.,roof. “It was too bad--it was really too bad--and she wondered what Mr.
6240,CHAPTER II.,Doppeldick would say to it when he came home.”

6246,CHAPTER III.,
6247,CHAPTER III.,MR. DOPPELDICK did come home--and he said nothing to it at all. He only
6248,CHAPTER III.,"pulled his tobacco-bag out of one coat-pocket, and his tobacco-pipe"
6249,CHAPTER III.,"out of the other, and then he struck a light, and fell to smoking,"
6250,CHAPTER III.,as complacently as if there had been no Captain Schenk in the world.
6251,CHAPTER III.,"The truth was, he had none of that nervous nicety of feeling, which"
6252,CHAPTER III.,"his partner possessed so eminently, and, accordingly, he took no more"
6253,CHAPTER III.,"interest in her domestic dilemma, than the walnut-wood chair that he"
6254,CHAPTER III.,"sat upon. Moreover, when he once had in his mouth his favourite pipe,"
6255,CHAPTER III.,"with a portrait of Kant on the bowl of it, he sucked through its tube a"
6256,CHAPTER III.,sort of Transcendental Philosophy which elevated him above all the ills
6257,CHAPTER III.,"of human life, to say nothing of such little domestic inconveniences"
6258,CHAPTER III.,"as the present. If the house had been as big as the hotel de Nassau,"
6259,CHAPTER III.,"at Schlangenbad, with as many chambers and spare beds in it--or a"
6260,CHAPTER III.,"barrack, with quarters for the captain and his company to boot--he"
6261,CHAPTER III.,could not have puffed on more contentedly. The very talk about beds
6262,CHAPTER III.,and bedding appeared to lull him into a sort of sleep with his eyes
6263,CHAPTER III.,open; and even when the voice and words of his helpmate grew a little
6264,CHAPTER III.,"sharp and querulous in detailing all her doubts, and difficulties, and"
6265,CHAPTER III.,"disagreeables, they could not raise even a ripple in the calm placid"
6266,CHAPTER III.,expanse of his forehead. How should they? His equable German good
6267,CHAPTER III.,"humour might well be invulnerable to all outward attacks, which had"
6268,CHAPTER III.,"so long withstood every internal one,--ay, in Temper’s very citadel,"
6269,CHAPTER III.,"the stomach. For instance, the better part of his daily diet was of"
6270,CHAPTER III.,"sours. He ate “sauer-kraut,” and “sauer-braten,” with sour sauce and"
6271,CHAPTER III.,"“sauer-ampfer” by way of salad, and pickled plums by way of dessert,"
6272,CHAPTER III.,"and “sauer-milch” with sourish brown bread--and then, to wash these"
6273,CHAPTER III.,"down, he drank sourish “Essigberger” wine, and “sauer-wasser,” of"
6274,CHAPTER III.,"which the village of Kleinewinkel had its own peculiar brunnen. Still,"
6275,CHAPTER III.,"I say, by all these sours, and many others not mentioned besides, his"
6276,CHAPTER III.,temper was never soured--nor could they turn one drop of the milk of
6277,CHAPTER III.,"human kindness that flowed in his bosom. Instead, therefore, of his"
6278,CHAPTER III.,"round features being ever rumpled and crumpled, and furrowed up by"
6279,CHAPTER III.,"the plough-share of passion, you never saw any thing on his face but"
6280,CHAPTER III.,the same everlasting sub-smile of phlegmatic philanthropy. In spite
6281,CHAPTER III.,"of the stream of complaint that kept pouring into his ear, he forgave"
6282,CHAPTER III.,Captain Schenk from the bottom of his soul for being billeted on him;
6283,CHAPTER III.,and entertained no more spleen towards the King of Prussia and the
6284,CHAPTER III.,"Quarter-master, than he did towards the gnat that bit him last year."
6285,CHAPTER III.,"At length, his pipe wanting replenishing, he dropped a few comfortable"
6286,CHAPTER III.,"words to his wife, meanwhile he refilled the bowl, and brought the"
6287,CHAPTER III.,engine again into play:--

6313,CHAPTER IV.,"better half, was a person of substance, keeping a good running account"
6314,CHAPTER IV.,"with Messer and Gabel. Besides, amongst other delicacies, the board"
6315,CHAPTER IV.,"actually displayed those rarest of all inland rarities, oysters,--a bag"
6316,CHAPTER IV.,"of which the warm-hearted Adam Kloot had sent, by way of a token of"
6317,CHAPTER IV.,"remembrance, to his old friend Dietrich; forgetting utterly that it was"
6318,CHAPTER IV.,full a hundred leagues from the nearest high water-mark of the sea to
6319,CHAPTER IV.,"the village of Kleinewinkel. Of course they came like other travellers,"
6320,CHAPTER IV.,"with their mouths wide agape, to see the wonders of the place,--but,"
6321,CHAPTER IV.,"then, so much the easier they were to open; and as the worthy couple"
6322,CHAPTER IV.,did not contemplate any such superfluous nicety as _shaving_ them
6323,CHAPTER IV.,"before they swallowed them, there was a fair chance that the delicious"
6324,CHAPTER IV.,morsels would all be devoured before the inauspicious arrival of
6325,CHAPTER IV.,Captain Schenk. Some such speculation seemed to glimmer in the eyes of
6326,CHAPTER IV.,"both Mr. and Mrs. Doppeldick--when, lo! just as the sixth dead oyster"
6327,CHAPTER IV.,"had been body-snatched out of its shell, and was being flavoured up"
6328,CHAPTER IV.,"with lemon and vinegar, the door opened, and in walked a blue cap with"
6329,CHAPTER IV.,"a red band, a pair of mustachios, and a grey cloak without any arms in"
6330,CHAPTER IV.,its sleeves. Had Madame Doppeldick held any thing but an oyster in her
6331,CHAPTER IV.,"mouth at that moment it would infallibly have choked her, the flutter"
6332,CHAPTER IV.,of her heart in her throat was so violent.
6333,CHAPTER IV.,
6334,CHAPTER IV.,“Holy Virgin!--Captain Schenk!”
6335,CHAPTER IV.,
6336,CHAPTER IV.,"“At your service, Madame,” answered a voice through the mustachios."
6337,CHAPTER IV.,
6338,CHAPTER IV.,"“You are welcome, Captain!” said the worthy master of the house, at"
6339,CHAPTER IV.,"the same time rising, and placing a chair for his guest at that side"
6340,CHAPTER IV.,"of the table which was farthest from the oysters. The officer, without"
6341,CHAPTER IV.,"any ceremony, threw himself into the seat, and then, resting his elbows"
6342,CHAPTER IV.,"upon the table, and his cheeks between his palms, he fixed his dark"
6343,CHAPTER IV.,eyes on the blushing face of Madame Doppeldick in a long and steady
6344,CHAPTER IV.,stare. It is true that he was only mentally reviewing the review;
6345,CHAPTER IV.,"or, possibly, calculating the chances he had made in favour of an"
6346,CHAPTER IV.,"application he had lately forwarded to Berlin, to be exchanged into"
6347,CHAPTER IV.,the Royal Guards; but the circumstance sufficed to set every nerve of
6348,CHAPTER IV.,"Madame Doppeldick a-vibrating, and in two minutes from his arrival, she"
6349,CHAPTER IV.,"had made up her mind that he was a very bold, forward, and presuming"
6350,CHAPTER IV.,young man.
6351,CHAPTER IV.,
6352,CHAPTER IV.,[Illustration: “O HAM--WHAT A FALLING OFF WAS THERE.”]
6353,CHAPTER IV.,
6354,CHAPTER IV.,"It is astonishing, when we have once conceived a prejudice, how"
6355,CHAPTER IV.,"rapidly it grows, and how plentifully it finds nutriment! Like the sea"
6356,CHAPTER IV.,"polypus, it extends its thousand feelers on every side, for anything"
6357,CHAPTER IV.,"they can lay hold of, and the smallest particle afloat in the ocean"
6358,CHAPTER IV.,of conjecture cannot escape from the tenacity of their grasp. So it
6359,CHAPTER IV.,"was with Madame Doppeldick. From mistrusting the captain’s eyes, she"
6360,CHAPTER IV.,"came to suspect his nose, his mustachios, his mouth, his chin, and"
6361,CHAPTER IV.,even the slight furrow of a sabre cut that scarred his forehead just
6362,CHAPTER IV.,over the left eyebrow. She felt morally sure that he had received it
6363,CHAPTER IV.,"in no battle-field, but in some scandalous duel. Luckily she had never"
6364,CHAPTER IV.,"seen Mozart’s celebrated opera, or she would inevitably have set down"
6365,CHAPTER IV.,"Captain Schenk as its libertine masquerading hero, Don Giovanni himself!"
6366,CHAPTER IV.,
6367,CHAPTER IV.,[Illustration: “A PIPING BULLFINCH.”]
6368,CHAPTER IV.,
6369,CHAPTER IV.,"“You will be sharp-set for supper, Captain,” said the hospitable"
6370,CHAPTER IV.,"host, pushing towards his guest a dish of lean home-made bacon; but"
6371,CHAPTER IV.,the Captain took no more notice of the invitation than if he had
6372,CHAPTER IV.,been stunned stone-deaf by the artillery at the sham-fight in the
6373,CHAPTER IV.,"morning. Possibly he did not like bacon, or, at any rate, such bacon"
6374,CHAPTER IV.,"as was set before him; for to put the naked Truth on her bare oath,"
6375,CHAPTER IV.,"the Kleinewinkel pigs always looked as if they got their living, like"
6376,CHAPTER IV.,"cockroaches, by creeping through cracks. However, he never changed"
6377,CHAPTER IV.,"his posture, but kept his dark intolerable eyes still fixed on his"
6378,CHAPTER IV.,"hostess’s full and flushed face. He might just as well have stared,--if"
6379,CHAPTER IV.,he must stare--at the shelves-full of old family china (some of it
6380,CHAPTER IV.,"elaborately mended and riveted) in the corner cupboard, the door of"
6381,CHAPTER IV.,"which she had left open on purpose; but he had, apparently, no such"
6382,CHAPTER IV.,considerate respect for female modesty.
6383,CHAPTER IV.,
6384,CHAPTER IV.,“Saint Ursula and the Eleven Thousand be near us!” said the disquieted
6385,CHAPTER IV.,Madame Doppeldick to herself. “It is hard enough for people of our
6386,CHAPTER IV.,"years and bulk to be obliged to lie double;--but to have a strange,"
6387,CHAPTER IV.,"wild, rakish, staring young fellow in the same chamber--I _do_ wish"
6388,CHAPTER IV.,"that Dietrich would make more haste with his supper, that we may get"
6389,CHAPTER IV.,into bed first!”
6390,CHAPTER IV.,
6391,CHAPTER IV.,
6392,CHAPTER V.,CHAPTER V.
6393,CHAPTER V.,
6394,CHAPTER V.,"HONEST Dietrich was in no such hurry. A rational, moral, pious man,"
6395,CHAPTER V.,with a due grateful sense of the sapidity of certain gifts of the
6396,CHAPTER V.,"Creator, ought not to swallow them with the post-haste indifference"
6397,CHAPTER V.,of a sow swilling her wash; and as Dietrich Doppeldick did not taste
6398,CHAPTER V.,"oysters once in ten years, it was a sort of religious obligation,"
6399,CHAPTER V.,"as well as a positive secular temptation, that the relish of each"
6400,CHAPTER V.,particular fish should be prolonged as far as possible on the palate by
6401,CHAPTER V.,"an orderly, decorous, and deliberate deglutition. Accordingly, instead"
6402,CHAPTER V.,"of bolting the oysters as if he had been swallowing them for a wager,"
6403,CHAPTER V.,"he sate soberly, with his eyes fixed on the two plumpest, as if only"
6404,CHAPTER V.,awaiting the “good-night” of his guest to do ample and Christian-like
6405,CHAPTER V.,justice to the edible forget-me-nots of his good friend Adam Kloot. In
6406,CHAPTER V.,"vain his wife looked hard at him, and trod on his toes as long as she"
6407,CHAPTER V.,"could reach them, besides being seized with a short hectic cough that"
6408,CHAPTER V.,was any thing but constitutional--
6409,CHAPTER V.,
6410,CHAPTER V.,"“Lord, help me!” said Mrs. Doppeldick in her soul, too fluttered to"
6411,CHAPTER V.,attend to the correctness of her metaphors--“It’s as easy to catch the
6412,CHAPTER V.,eye of a post!--He minds me no more than if I trod on the toes of a
6413,CHAPTER V.,stock-fish! I might as well cough into the ears of a stone wall.”
6414,CHAPTER V.,
6415,CHAPTER V.,"In fact, honest Dietrich had totally forgotten the domestic dilemma."
6416,CHAPTER V.,
6417,CHAPTER V.,[Illustration: “KISSING GOES BY FAVOUR.”]
6418,CHAPTER V.,
6419,CHAPTER V.,"“He will never take his eyes off,” thought Madame Doppeldick, stealing"
6420,CHAPTER V.,"a glance across the table; “I was never so stared at, never since"
6421,CHAPTER V.,I was a girl and wore pigtails! I expect every moment he will jump
6422,CHAPTER V.,and embrace me.” Whereas nothing could be further from the Captain’s
6423,CHAPTER V.,"thought. The second battalion had joined that very morning, and"
6424,CHAPTER V.,"accordingly he had kissed, or been kissed by, all its eight-and-twenty"
6425,CHAPTER V.,"officers, tall or short, fat or lean, fair or swarthy,--which was quite"
6426,CHAPTER V.,"kissing enough for a reasonable day’s ration. The truth is, he was"
6427,CHAPTER V.,"staring at himself. He had just, mentally, put on a new uniform, and"
6428,CHAPTER V.,"was looking with the back of his eyes at his own brilliant figure, as"
6429,CHAPTER V.,"a Captain in the Royal Guards. It was, however, a stare, outwardly,"
6430,CHAPTER V.,"at Madame Doppeldick, who took everything to herself, frogs, lace,"
6431,CHAPTER V.,"bullion, buttons, cuffs, collars, epaulettes, and the Deuce knows what"
6432,CHAPTER V.,besides.
6433,CHAPTER V.,
6434,CHAPTER V.,"“I would to Heaven!” she wished, “he had never thought of going into"
6435,CHAPTER V.,"the army,--or at least that the Quarter-master had never taken it into"
6436,CHAPTER V.,his stupid head to quarter him on us. Young gay Captains are very well
6437,CHAPTER V.,"to flirt with, or to waltz with, but at my years and bulk waltzing is"
6438,CHAPTER V.,quite out of the question!”

6444,CHAPTER VI.,
6445,CHAPTER VI.,"AT last Captain Schenk changed his posture, and averted his familiar"
6446,CHAPTER VI.,eyes from the face of Madame Doppeldick; but it was only to give her a
6447,CHAPTER VI.,fresh alarm with his free-and-easy mouth. First of all he clenched his
6448,CHAPTER VI.,"fists--then he raised his arms at full stretch above his head, as if"
6449,CHAPTER VI.,"he wanted to be crucified, and then turning his face upwards towards"
6450,CHAPTER VI.,"the ceiling, with his eyes shut, and his jaws open--he yawned such a"
6451,CHAPTER VI.,"yawn, as panther never yawned after prowling all day without prey, in a"
6452,CHAPTER VI.,ten-foot cage--
6453,CHAPTER VI.,
6454,CHAPTER VI.,“Auw-yauw-au-ya-augh-auwayawauwghf!”
6455,CHAPTER VI.,
6456,CHAPTER VI.,[Illustration: HOB AND NOB.]
6457,CHAPTER VI.,
6458,CHAPTER VI.,"“By all the Saints,” thought the terrified Madame Doppeldick, “he will"
6459,CHAPTER VI.,be for packing off to bed at once!”--and in the vain hope of inducing
6460,CHAPTER VI.,"him to sup beforehand, she seized, yes, she actually seized the devoted"
6461,CHAPTER VI.,"dish of oysters, and made them relieve guard, with the home-made bacon,"
6462,CHAPTER VI.,just under the Captain’s nose. It was now honest Dietrich’s turn to
6463,CHAPTER VI.,"try to catch the eyes of posts, and tread on the toes of stock-fish;"
6464,CHAPTER VI.,"however, for this time the natives were safe."
6465,CHAPTER VI.,
6466,CHAPTER VI.,"“By your leave, Madame,” said the abominable voice through the"
6467,CHAPTER VI.,"moustachios, “I will take nothing except a candle. What with the heavy"
6468,CHAPTER VI.,"rain at first, and then the horse artillery ploughing up our marching"
6469,CHAPTER VI.,"ground, I am really dog-tired with my day’s work. If you will do me the"
6470,CHAPTER VI.,"favour, therefore, to show me to my chamber----”"

6472,CHAPTER VI.,[Illustration: “WHAT NEXT?” AS THE FROG SAID WHEN HIS TAIL FELL OFF.]
6473,CHAPTER VI.,
6474,CHAPTER VI.,“Not for the whole world!” exclaimed the horrified Madame
6475,CHAPTER VI.,"Doppeldick--“not for the whole world, I mean, till you have"
6476,CHAPTER VI.,"hob-and-nobbed with us--at least with the good man”--and, like a"
6477,CHAPTER VI.,"warm-hearted hostess, jealous of the honour of her hospitality, she"
6478,CHAPTER VI.,"snatched up the spare-candle, and hurried off to the barrel. If she"
6479,CHAPTER VI.,"could but set them down to drinking, she calculated, let who _would_ be"
6480,CHAPTER VI.,"the second, she would herself be the first in bed, if she jumped into"
6481,CHAPTER VI.,"it with all her clothes on. It was a likely scheme enough,--but alas!"
6482,CHAPTER VI.,"it fell through, like the rest!--Before she had drawn half a flask of"
6483,CHAPTER VI.,"Essigberger, or Holzapfelheimer, for I forget which--she was alarmed"
6484,CHAPTER VI.,by the double screech of two chairs pushed suddenly back on the
6485,CHAPTER VI.,uncarpeted floor. Then came a trampling of light and heavy feet--and
6486,CHAPTER VI.,although she dropped the bottle--and forgot to turn the spigot--and
6487,CHAPTER VI.,carried the candle without the candlestick--and left her left slipper
6488,CHAPTER VI.,"behind her,--still, in spite of all the haste she could make, she"
6489,CHAPTER VI.,only reached the stair-foot just in time to see two Prussian-blue
6490,CHAPTER VI.,"coat-tails, turned up with red, whisking in at the bed-room door!"
6491,CHAPTER VI.,
6492,CHAPTER VI.,
6493,CHAPTER VII.,CHAPTER VII.
6494,CHAPTER VII.,
6495,CHAPTER VII.,"“OH the cruel, the killing ill-luck that pursues us!” exclaimed the"
6496,CHAPTER VII.,"forlorn Madame Doppeldick, as her husband returned, with his mouth"
6497,CHAPTER VII.,"watering, to the little parlour, where, by some sort of attraction,"
6498,CHAPTER VII.,"he was drawn into the Captain’s vacant chair, instead of his own. In"
6499,CHAPTER VII.,"a few seconds the plumpest of Adam Kloot’s tender souvenirs, of about"
6500,CHAPTER VII.,"the size and shape of a penny bun, was sliding over his tongue. Then"
6501,CHAPTER VII.,"another went--and another--and another. They were a little gone or so,"
6502,CHAPTER VII.,"and no wonder; for they had travelled up the Rhine and the Moselle, in"
6503,CHAPTER VII.,"a dry “schiff,” not a “dampschiff,” towed by real horse-powers, instead"
6504,CHAPTER VII.,"of steam-powers, against the stream. To tell the naked truth, there"
6505,CHAPTER VII.,were only four words in the world that a respectably fresh Cod’s head
6506,CHAPTER VII.,"could have said to them, namely--"
6507,CHAPTER VII.,
6508,CHAPTER VII.,[Illustration: “NONE OF YOUR SAUCE.”]
6509,CHAPTER VII.,
6510,CHAPTER VII.,"No matter: down they went glibly, glibly. The lemon-juice did something"
6511,CHAPTER VII.,"for them, and the vinegar still more, by making them seem sharp instead"
6512,CHAPTER VII.,of flat. Honest Dietrich enjoyed them as mightily as Adam Kloot could
6513,CHAPTER VII.,"have wished; and was in no humour, you may be sure, for spinning prolix"
6514,CHAPTER VII.,answers or long-winded speeches.
6515,CHAPTER VII.,
6516,CHAPTER VII.,“They are good--very!--excellent! Malchen!--Just eat a couple.”
6517,CHAPTER VII.,
6518,CHAPTER VII.,But the mind of the forlorn Malchen was occupied with any thing but
6519,CHAPTER VII.,"oysters; it was fixed upon things above, or at least overhead. “I do"
6520,CHAPTER VII.,"not think I can sit up all night,” she murmured, concluding with such"
6521,CHAPTER VII.,a gape that the tears squeezed out plentifully between her fat little
6522,CHAPTER VII.,eyelids.
6523,CHAPTER VII.,
6524,CHAPTER VII.,“I’ve found only one bad one--and that was full of black
6525,CHAPTER VII.,mud--schloo--oo--oo--ooop!”--slirropped honest Dietrich. N. B. There
6526,CHAPTER VII.,is no established formula of minims and crotchets on the gamut to
6527,CHAPTER VII.,represent the swallowing of an oyster: so the aforesaid syllables of
6528,CHAPTER VII.,"“schloo--oo--oo--ooop,” must stand in their stead."
6529,CHAPTER VII.,
6530,CHAPTER VII.,"“As for sleeping in my clothes,” continued Madame Doppeldick, “the"
6531,CHAPTER VII.,"weather is so very warm,--and the little window won’t open--and with"
6532,CHAPTER VII.,two in a bed--”
6533,CHAPTER VII.,
6534,CHAPTER VII.,"“The English do it, Malchen,--schloo--oo--ooop!”"
6535,CHAPTER VII.,
6536,CHAPTER VII.,"“But the English beds have curtains,” said Madame Doppeldick, “thick"
6537,CHAPTER VII.,"stuff or canvas curtains, Dietrich,--all round, and over the top--just"
6538,CHAPTER VII.,like a general’s tent.”
6539,CHAPTER VII.,
6540,CHAPTER VII.,"“We can go--schloo--ooop--to bed in the dark, Malchen.”"
6541,CHAPTER VII.,
6542,CHAPTER VII.,"“No--no,” objected Madam Doppeldick, with a grave shake of her head."
6543,CHAPTER VII.,"“We’ll have no blindman’s-buff work, Dietrich,--and maybe blundering"
6544,CHAPTER VII.,into wrong beds.”
6545,CHAPTER VII.,
6546,CHAPTER VII.,“Schloo--oo--oo--oo--ooop.”
6547,CHAPTER VII.,
6548,CHAPTER VII.,"“And if ever I saw a wild, rakish, immoral, irreligious-looking young"
6549,CHAPTER VII.,"man, Dietrich, the Captain is one!”"
6550,CHAPTER VII.,
6551,CHAPTER VII.,“Schloo--oo--oo--oo--ooop.”
6552,CHAPTER VII.,
6553,CHAPTER VII.,"“Did you observe, Dietrich, how shamefully he stared at me?”"
6554,CHAPTER VII.,
6555,CHAPTER VII.,“Schloo--ooop.”
6556,CHAPTER VII.,
6557,CHAPTER VII.,"“And the cut on his forehead, Dietrich, I’ll be bound he got it for no"
6558,CHAPTER VII.,good!”
6559,CHAPTER VII.,
6560,CHAPTER VII.,“Schloo--oo--oo--oo--ooop.”
6561,CHAPTER VII.,
6562,CHAPTER VII.,“Confound Adam Kloot and his oysters to boot!” exclaimed the offended
6563,CHAPTER VII.,"Madame Doppeldick, irritated beyond all patience at the bovine apathy"
6564,CHAPTER VII.,"of her connubial partner. “I wish, I do, that the nets had burst in"
6565,CHAPTER VII.,catching them!”
6566,CHAPTER VII.,
6567,CHAPTER VII.,"“Why, what can one do, Malchen?” asked honest Dietrich, looking up for"
6568,CHAPTER VII.,"the first time from the engrossing dish, whence the one-a-penny oysters"
6569,CHAPTER VII.,"had all vanished, leaving only the two-a-penny ones behind."
6570,CHAPTER VII.,
6571,CHAPTER VII.,"“Saint Ursula only knows!” sighed Madame Doppeldick, her voice"
6572,CHAPTER VII.,relapsing into its former tone of melancholy. “I only know that I will
6573,CHAPTER VII.,never undress in the room!”
6574,CHAPTER VII.,
6575,CHAPTER VII.,"“Then you must undress out of it, Malchen. Schloo--oop."
6576,CHAPTER VII.,Schloo--oo--oo--oo--ooop.”
6577,CHAPTER VII.,
6578,CHAPTER VII.,"“I believe that must be the way after all,” said Madame Doppeldick,"
6579,CHAPTER VII.,on whose mind her husband’s sentence of transcendental philosophy had
6580,CHAPTER VII.,cast a new light. “To be sure there is a little landing-place at the
6581,CHAPTER VII.,"stair-head, and _our_ bed is exactly opposite the door--and if one"
6582,CHAPTER VII.,"scuttled briskly across the room, and jumped in--But are you sure,"
6583,CHAPTER VII.,"Dietrich, that you explained every thing correctly to the Captain? Did"
6584,CHAPTER VII.,you tell him that _his_ was the one next the window--with the patchwork
6585,CHAPTER VII.,coverlet?”
6586,CHAPTER VII.,
6587,CHAPTER VII.,"“Not a word of it!” answered honest Dietrich, who like all other"
6588,CHAPTER VII.,"Prussians had served his two years as a soldier, and was therefore"
6589,CHAPTER VII.,moderately interested in military manœuvres. “Not a word of it--we
6590,CHAPTER VII.,"talked all about the review. But I did what was far better, my own"
6591,CHAPTER VII.,"Malchen, for I saw him get into the bed with the patchwork coverlet,"
6592,CHAPTER VII.,"with my own eyes, and then took away his candle--Schloo--oo--oop!”"
6593,CHAPTER VII.,
6594,CHAPTER VII.,"“It was done like my own dear, kind Dietrich,” exclaimed the delighted"
6595,CHAPTER VII.,"Madame Doppeldick, and in the sudden revulsion of her feelings, she"
6596,CHAPTER VII.,"actually pulled up his huge round bullet-head from the dish, and kissed"
6597,CHAPTER VII.,him between the nose and chin.
6598,CHAPTER VII.,
6599,CHAPTER VII.,"The Domestic Dilemma was disarmed of its horns, Madame Doppeldick saw"
6600,CHAPTER VII.,"her way before her, as clear and open as the Rhine three months after"
6601,CHAPTER VII.,"the ice has broken up. From that moment, as long as the dish contained"
6602,CHAPTER VII.,"two oysters, the air of “Schloo--oo--oo--oo--ooop” was sung, as"
6603,CHAPTER VII.,“arranged for a duet.”

6607,CHAPTER VIII.,
6608,CHAPTER VIII.,"“ALL is quiet, thank Heaven! the Captain is as fast as a church,”"
6609,CHAPTER VIII.,"thought Madame Doppeldick, as she stood in nocturnal dishabille, on the"
6610,CHAPTER VIII.,"little landing-place, at the stair-head. “Now then, my own Dietrich,”"
6611,CHAPTER VIII.,"she whispered, “are you ready to run?” For like the best of wives, as"
6612,CHAPTER VIII.,"she was, she did not much care to go anywhere without her husband."
6613,CHAPTER VIII.,
6614,CHAPTER VIII.,But the deliberate Dietrich was not prepared to escort her. He had
6615,CHAPTER VIII.,"chosen to undress as usual, with his transcendental pipe in his mouth;"
6616,CHAPTER VIII.,indeed it was always the last thing that he took off before getting
6617,CHAPTER VIII.,"into bed, so that till all his philosophy was burned to ashes, his mind"
6618,CHAPTER VIII.,"would not consent to any active corporeal exertion, especially to any"
6619,CHAPTER VIII.,"locomotion so rapid as a race. At last he stood balancing, made up for"
6620,CHAPTER VIII.,"the start; his eyes staring, his teeth clenched, his fists doubled,"
6621,CHAPTER VIII.,"and his arms swinging, as if he were about to be admitted a burgess of"
6622,CHAPTER VIII.,"Andernach--that is to say, by leaping backwards over a winnowing fan,"
6623,CHAPTER VIII.,"with a well poised pail of water in his arms, in order to show if he"
6624,CHAPTER VIII.,accomplished it neatly.
6625,CHAPTER VIII.,
6626,CHAPTER VIII.,"“The night-light may be left burning where it is, Dietrich.”"
6627,CHAPTER VIII.,
6628,CHAPTER VIII.,"“Now then, Malchen!”"
6629,CHAPTER VIII.,
6630,CHAPTER VIII.,"“Now then Dietrich,--and run gently--on your toes!”"
6631,CHAPTER VIII.,
6632,CHAPTER VIII.,No sooner said than done. The modest Malchen with the speed of a young
6633,CHAPTER VIII.,"wild elephant made a rush across the room, and, with something of a"
6634,CHAPTER VIII.,"jump and something more of a scramble, plunged headlong into the bed."
6635,CHAPTER VIII.,"The phlegmatic Dietrich was a thought later, from having included"
6636,CHAPTER VIII.,"the whole length of the landing-place in his run, to help him in his"
6637,CHAPTER VIII.,"leap, so that just as his bulk came squash! upon the coverlet, his"
6638,CHAPTER VIII.,"predecessor was tumbling her body, skow-wow, bow-wow, any-how, over the"

6908,REMARKS.,NO season has offered such _variétés_ in costume as the early part
6909,REMARKS.,of the present month. Fancy dresses of the most _outré_ description
6910,REMARKS.,"have appeared, even in the streets. Short waists and long, full"
6911,REMARKS.,"sleeves and empty, broad skirts and narrow, whole skirts, half skirts,"
6912,REMARKS.,"and none at all, have been indifferently worn. For the _Promenade_,"
6913,REMARKS.,rags and tatters of all kinds have been in much favour; very few
6914,REMARKS.,"buttons are worn; and the coats, waistcoats, and pantaloons, have"
6915,REMARKS.,been invariably padded and stuffed with hay or straw. We observed
6916,REMARKS.,several _exquisites_ making morning calls in scare-crow great-coats;
6917,REMARKS.,"the skirts, lappels, collars, and cuffs, picturesquely, but not too"
6918,REMARKS.,"formally, jagged _à la Vandyke_. The prevailing colours--all colours"
6919,REMARKS.,at once. Wigs have been very general--both _en buzz_ and _frizzé_;
6920,REMARKS.,these have been commonly composed of deal shavings; but in some cases
6921,REMARKS.,"of tow, and sometimes horse-hair. For the evening party, a few squibs"
6922,REMARKS.,"and crackers are stuck in the _perruque_ or hat, and the boots and"
6923,REMARKS.,shoes are polished up with a little pitch or tar; sometimes a Catherine
6924,REMARKS.,"wheel has been added _en coquarde_. Frills, collars, and ruffles, of"
6925,REMARKS.,"_papier coupé_, have entirely superseded those of cambric or lace, and"
6926,REMARKS.,shirts of every description are quite discarded. Paint has been in much
6927,REMARKS.,"request, and ruddle seems to have been preferred to _rouge_; patches"
6928,REMARKS.,"are also much worn, not on the countenance, but on the clothes; for"
6929,REMARKS.,"these the favourite _matériel_ is tartan, plush of any colour, or"
6930,REMARKS.,"corduroy. Several dandies appeared on the 5th with gloves, but they"
6931,REMARKS.,are not essential requisites to be in the _ton_: canes are discarded;
6932,REMARKS.,"even a riding-whip would be reckoned to evince _mauvais goût_, but"
6933,REMARKS.,a half-penny bunch of matches “_à la main_” is indispensable to a
6934,REMARKS.,fashionable aspirant. The old practice of being carried abroad in
6935,REMARKS.,"chairs has been universally revived; and it must be confessed, that it"
6936,REMARKS.,exhibits the Figure to much advantage.

6942,REMARKS.,"colour formerly so much in vogue under the name of _fumée de Londres_,"
6943,REMARKS.,turned up with _flamme d’enfer_. It was _garni_ with very dead gold;
6944,REMARKS.,"and slashed _à l’Espagnole_, back and front. The pantaloons were"
6945,REMARKS.,"equally _bizarre_; one leg being composed of Scotch tartan, and the"
6946,REMARKS.,"other of blue striped bed-ticking, made very full, _en matelot_, in"
6947,REMARKS.,compliance with the prevailing taste for navals. The wig was made of
6948,REMARKS.,"green and white willow shavings, with a large link for a _queue_, tied"
6949,REMARKS.,"on with a _nœud_ of red tape. The hat, brown, somewhat darker than"
6950,REMARKS.,"the Devonshire beaver, but disinclining to black. It had no brim, and"
6951,REMARKS.,"was without a crown. A tarnished badge of the Phœnix Fire Office, on"
6952,REMARKS.,"the bust, gave a _distingué_ air to the whole Figure, which was going"

7738,SOME ACCOUNT OF WILLIAM WHISTON.,made him a whist-player for life. Our bias dates much earlier than some

7743,SOME ACCOUNT OF WILLIAM WHISTON.,At school he was a total failure; except in reckoning the odd tricks.

7748,SOME ACCOUNT OF WILLIAM WHISTON.,"At sixteen, after a long maternal debate between the black and red"

7757,SOME ACCOUNT OF WILLIAM WHISTON.,"William having served his time, and, as he calls it, followed suit for"

7765,SOME ACCOUNT OF WILLIAM WHISTON.,His own explanation was that he “_was discarded_.” He then paid his

7776,SOME ACCOUNT OF WILLIAM WHISTON.,"whist. His whole conversation, except on cards, is wool-gathering;"
7777,SOME ACCOUNT OF WILLIAM WHISTON.,"and on that subject is like wool--carded. He “speaks by the card,”"
7778,SOME ACCOUNT OF WILLIAM WHISTON.,and never gives equivocation a chance. At the Olympic once he had a

7798,SOME ACCOUNT OF WILLIAM WHISTON.,alteration of attitude or look. He is a small statue erected in honour
7799,SOME ACCOUNT OF WILLIAM WHISTON.,"of whist, and like Eloquence, “holds his hand well up.” He is content"

8038,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
8039,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,MY first acquaintance with the press--a memorable event in an author’s
8040,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,experience--took place in Scotland. Amongst the temporary sojourners
8041,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"at our boarding-house, there came a legal antiquarian who had been"
8042,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"sent for from Edinburgh, expressly to make some unprofitable researches"
8043,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"amongst the mustiest of the civic records. It was my humour to think,"
8044,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"that in Political as well as Domestic Economy, it must be better to"
8045,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,sweep the Present than to dust the Past; and certain new brooms were
8046,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"recommended to the Town Council in a quizzing letter, which the then"
8047,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"editor of the Dundee Advertiser or Chronicle, thought fit to favour"
8048,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"with a prominent place in his columns. “’Tis pleasant sure,” sings"
8049,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Lord Byron, “to see one’s self in print,” and according to the popular"
8050,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"notion I ought to have been quite up in my stirrups, if not standing"
8051,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"on the saddle, at thus seeing myself, for the first strange time, set"
8052,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"up in type. Memory recalls, however, but a very moderate share of"
8053,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"exaltation, which was totally eclipsed, moreover, by the exuberant"
8054,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"transports of an accessory before the fact, whom, methinks, I still"
8055,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"see in my mind’s eye, rushing out of the printing-office with the wet"
8056,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"sheet steaming in his hand, and fluttering all along the High Street,"
8057,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,to announce breathlessly that “we were in.” But G. was an indifferent
8058,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"scholar, even in English, and therefore thought the more highly of"
8059,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"this literary feat. It was this defective education, and the want of"
8060,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"a proper vent for his abundant love nonsense in prose or verse, that"
8061,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"probably led to the wound he subsequently inflicted on his own throat,"
8062,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,but which was luckily remedied by “a stitch in time.” The failure of
8063,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"a tragedy is very apt to produce something like a comedy, and few"
8064,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,afterpieces have amused me more than the behaviour of this Amicus
8065,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Redivivus, when, thus dramatising the saying of “cut and come again,”"
8066,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,he made what ought to have been a posthumous appearance amongst his
8067,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"friends. In fact, and he was ludicrously alive to it, he had placed"
8068,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,himself for all his supplementary days in a false position. Like the
8069,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"old man in the fable, after formally calling upon Death to execute"
8070,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"a general release, he had quietly resumed his fardel, which he bore"
8071,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"about, with exactly the uneasy ridiculous air of a fine-would be"
8072,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"gentleman, who is sensitively conscious that he is carrying a bundle."
8073,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"For the sake of our native sentimentalists who profess dying for love,"
8074,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"as well as the foreign romanticists who affect a love for dying, it may"
8075,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,not be amiss to give a slight sketch of the bearing of a traveller who
8076,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"had gone through half the journey. I had been absent some months, and"
8077,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"was consequently ignorant of the affair, when lo! on my return to the"
8078,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"town, the very first person who accosted me in the market-place was our"
8079,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"felo-de-se; and truly, no Bashful Man, “with all his blushing honours"
8080,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"thick upon him,” in the presence of a damp stranger, could have been"
8081,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"more divertingly sheepish, and awkwardly backward in coming forward"
8082,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"as to manner and address. Indeed, something or the embarrassment of"
8083,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"a fresh introduction might naturally be felt by an individual, thus"
8084,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"beginning again, as the lawyers say, _de novo_, and renewing ties he"
8085,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,had virtually cast off. The guilty hand was as dubiously extended to
8086,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"me as if it had been a dyer’s,--its fellow meanwhile performing sundry"
8087,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"involuntary motions and manipulations about his cravat, as if nervously"
8088,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,mistrusting the correctness of the ties or the stability of a buckle.
8089,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"As for his face, there was a foolish, deprecatory smile upon it that"
8090,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,would have puzzled the pencil of Wilkie; and even Liston himself could
8091,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"scarcely have parodied the indescribable croak with which, conscious of"
8092,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"an unlucky notoriety, he inquired “if I had heard”--here, a short husky"
8093,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,cough--“of anything particular?”
8094,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
8095,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"“Not a word,” was the answer."
8096,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
8097,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"“Then you don’t know”(--more fidgeting about the neck, the smile"
8098,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"rather sillier, the voice more guttural, and the cough worse than"
8099,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"ever)--“then you don’t know”--but, like Macbeth’s amen, the confession"
8100,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"literally stuck in the culprit’s throat; and I was left to learn, an"
8101,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"hour afterwards, and from another source, that “Jemmy G*** had _fought"
8102,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"a duel with himself_, and cut his own weazand, about a lady.”"
8103,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
8104,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"For my own part, with the above figure, and all its foolish features"
8105,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"vividly imprinted on my memory, I do not think that I could ever"
8106,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"seriously attempt “what Cato did, and Addison approved,” in my own"
8107,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"person. On the contrary, it seems to me that the English moralist gave"
8108,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,but an Irish illustration of “a brave man struggling with the storms
8109,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of fate,” by representing him as wilfully scuttling his own hold,"
8110,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and going at once to the bottom. As for the Censor, he plainly laid"
8111,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"himself open to censure, when he used a naked sword as a stomachic--a"
8112,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"very sorry way, by the way, when weary of conjectures, of enjoying"
8113,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the benefit of the doubt, and for which, were I tasked to select an"
8114,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"inscription for his cenotaph, it should be the exclamation of Thisby,"
8115,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,in the Midsummer Night’s Dream--
8116,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
8117,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,“This is old Ninny’s tomb.”
8118,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
8119,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"_Mais revenons à nos moutons_, as the wolf said to her cubs. The"
8120,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,reception of my letter in the Dublin Newspaper encouraged me to forward
8121,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"a contribution to the Dundee Magazine, the Editor of which was kind"
8122,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"enough, as Winifred Jenkins says, to “wrap my bit of nonsense under"
8123,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"his Honour’s Kiver,” without charging anything for its insertion."
8124,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Here was success sufficient to turn a young author at once into “a
8125,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"scribbling miller,” and make him sell himself, body and soul, after"
8126,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the German fashion, to that minor Mephistopheles, the Printer’s Devil!"
8127,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Nevertheless, it was not till years afterwards, and the lapse of"
8128,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"term equal to an ordinary apprenticeship, that the Imp in question"
8129,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"became really my Familiar. In the meantime, I continued to compose"
8130,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"occasionally, and, like the literary performances of Mr. Weller Senior,"
8131,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"my lucubrations were generally committed to paper, not in what is"
8132,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"commonly called written hand, but an imitation of print. Such a course"
8133,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"hints suspiciously of type and antetype, and a longing eye to the Row,"
8134,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"whereas, it was adopted simply to make the reading more easy, and"
8135,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,thus enable me the more readily to form a judgment of the effect of
8136,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,my little efforts. It is more difficult than may be supposed to decide
8137,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"on the value of a work in MS., and especially when the handwriting"
8138,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"presents only a swell mob of bad characters, that must be severally"
8139,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,examined and re-examined to arrive at the merits or demerits of the
8140,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"case. Print settles it, as Coleridge used to say; and to be candid, I"
8141,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"have more than once reversed, or greatly modified a previous verdict,"
8142,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"on seeing a rough proof from the press. But, as Editors too well know,"
8143,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"it is next to impossible to retain the tune of a stanza, or the drift"
8144,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of an argument, whilst the mind has to scramble through a patch of"
8145,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"scribble scrabble, as stiff as a gorse cover. The beauties of the"
8146,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,piece will as naturally appear to disadvantage through such a medium
8147,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,as the features of a pretty woman through a bad pane of glass; and
8148,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"without doubt, many a tolerable article has been consigned hand over"
8149,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"head to the Balaam Box for want of a fair copy. Wherefore, O ye Poets"
8150,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and Prosers, who aspire to write in Miscellanies, and above all, O ye"
8151,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"palpitating Untried, who meditate the offer of your maiden essays to"
8152,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"established periodicals, take care, pray ye take care, to cultivate a"
8153,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"good, plain, bold, round text. Set up Tomkins as well as Pope or Dryden"
8154,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"for a model, and have an eye to your pothooks. Some persons hold that"
8155,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the best writers are those who write the best hands, and I have known"
8156,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,the conductor of a magazine to be converted by a crabbed MS. to the
8157,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"same opinion. Of all things, therefore, be legible; and to that end,"
8158,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"practise in penmanship. If you have never learned, take six lessons of"
8159,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Mr. Carstairs. Be sure to buy the best paper, the best ink, the best"
8160,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"pens, and then sit down and do the best you can; as the schoolboys"
8161,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"do--put out your tongue, and take pains. So shall ye haply escape the"
8162,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"rash rejection of a jaded editor; so, having got in your hand, it is"
8163,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"possible that your head may follow; and so, last not least, ye may"
8164,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,fortunately avert those awful mistakes of the press which sometimes
8165,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"ruin a poet’s sublimest effusion, by pantomimically transforming his"
8166,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"roses into noses, his angels into angles, and all his happiness into"
8167,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,pappiness.

8216,CONSIDERED PER SE.,present case the unreserved communication of occult knowledge led to
8217,CONSIDERED PER SE.,anything but a satisfactory result. No one could take more pains--call

8221,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"of his blue eyes, declaring that he felt amply repaid by the supposed"
8222,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"proficiency of his pupil,--when, all of a sudden, his well-earned"
8223,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"pride was dashed to the deck by the pupil’s turning away on his heel,"
8224,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"with a hunch of his shoulders, a blank look, and a dissatisfied grunt,"

8310,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"its floor, that he might very much improve his paternal estate, to"
8311,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"wit, by levelling, and still more by draining it. I would flatly say"
8312,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"to him, lying flat on my face as it now happens, that a few little"
8313,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"gravel walks, merely across and across it, would be of rare advantage"
8314,CONSIDERED PER SE.,both for show and use. For ’tis a sorry pleasure-garden that is all
8315,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"fish-pond; and, finally, I would broadly hint to him, from the broad"
8316,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"of my back, as I am at this present---- But this is bullying Taurus"
8317,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"behind his back. There is no sea-god present, only the Skipper. How he"
8318,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"skips in such weather, give him his pick of all the ropes in the ship,"
8319,CONSIDERED PER SE.,is a miracle I would fain see ere I believe in it. For my own part I
8320,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"cannot even step deliberately over a thread. Perhaps, without going too"
8321,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"curiously into the Doctrine of Predestination, as regards the soul, it"
8322,CONSIDERED PER SE.,may hold good as concerns the body. Undoubtedly there be some men born
8323,CONSIDERED PER SE.,to sit fast upon horses; others to fall off therefrom as if they had
8324,CONSIDERED PER SE.,soaped saddles. Some to slide and skate upon the ice; others only to
8325,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"slip, straddle, and sprawl upon it. Some to walk, or at least waddle,"
8326,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"on ships’ decks; others to flop, flounder, wallow, and grovel thereon."
8327,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"That is my destiny. None can be more safe on the Serpentine, or sure"
8328,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"in the saddle;--but Fate, long before my great-great-great-grandfather"
8329,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"was put to his feet, forbade me sea-legs. An average pedestrian on"
8330,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"land, on the caulked plank I am a born cripple, hopeless of cure. Put"
8331,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"me apprentice to the Goodwin, or the Dudgeon Light, at the end of my"
8332,CONSIDERED PER SE.,term you shall find me as unsafe on my soles as when I first paid my
8333,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"footing. Even now, whilst Hans Vandergroot and his crew are comfortably"
8334,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"promenading, I rock and totter, balancing one end against the other,"
8335,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"like a great rickety babe, until, after some posturing and scrambling,"
8336,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"I trip up over nothing, and fall flat on everything. An earthquake in"
8337,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"London, when its streets are what is called greasy, could not more"
8338,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"puzzle my centre of gravity; if, indeed, I was not born a mathematical"
8339,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"monster, devoid of that material point!"
8340,CONSIDERED PER SE.,
8341,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"By way of clincher, Fate, who never does things by halves, whilst"
8342,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"foredooming me incapable of standing my ground at sea, has also denied"
8343,CONSIDERED PER SE.,me the power of settling it. A camp-stool is sure to decamp with me; a
8344,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"chair, as if it stood on Siberian ice, suddenly throws itself on its"
8345,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"back, and behold me in an extempore sledge! Barrels roll from under"
8346,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"me; coils of rope shuffle me off. Even on the plain bare hard deck,"
8347,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"or cabin floor, I throw demi-summersets, as if I had been returned to"
8348,CONSIDERED PER SE.,Parliament to represent the Antipodes by sitting on the back of my head.
8349,CONSIDERED PER SE.,
8350,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"To complete the Sea Curse,--there are three Fates, and each had a"
8351,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"boon for me at my birth--it was ordained that, like the great Nelson,"
8352,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"I should never sail from fresh water into salt, without knowing it by"
8353,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"a general rising and commotion, which might be called figuratively, a"
8354,CONSIDERED PER SE.,Mutiny at the Nore.
8355,CONSIDERED PER SE.,
8356,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"Like the standing and sitting infirmity, it is incurable. On my voyage"
8357,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"outwards I tried every popular recipe; the hard ones first, to wit, raw"
8358,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"carrots, raw onions, sailors’ biscuit with Dutch cheese, hard-boiled"
8359,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"eggs, hard dumplings, raw stockfish. Next the easy ones: namely, cream"
8360,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"cheese, Welsh rabbits, maccaroni, very hasty pudding, and insupportable"
8361,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"soup. Then the neutrals: such as chewed blotting-paper, dry oatmeal,"
8362,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"pounded egg-shells, scraped chalk, and unbaked dough."
8363,CONSIDERED PER SE.,
8364,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"To wash these down, I took, by prescription, tea without milk, coffee"
8365,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"without sugar, bark without wine, water without brandy; and these"
8366,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"formulæ all failing, I then tried them, as witches pray, backwards;"
8367,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"brandy without water, wine without bark, and so forth. The experimental"
8368,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"combinations followed; rum and milk, and mustard; eggs and wine, and"
8369,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"camomile tea; gin and beer, and vinegar; sea-water and salad-oil,"
8370,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"mulled, with sugar and nutmeg. Of which last, I drank by advice most"
8371,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"prodigiously, the Doctors of the Marine College dispensing always on"
8372,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"the Homœopathic principle, that a large dose of anything, whereof a"
8373,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"little would set you wrong on the land, will set you right on the sea."
8374,CONSIDERED PER SE.,
8375,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"I need hardly say that, with my predisposed _necessitarian_ viscera,"
8376,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"all these infallible remedies failed of any effect, except to aggravate"
8377,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"my case. Nothing short of liquid lead, maybe, or potable plaster of"
8378,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"Paris, would have proved a settler."
8379,CONSIDERED PER SE.,
8380,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"Happy the man who hath never been driven in his despair to test,"
8381,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"detest, invoke, evoke, swallow, and unswallow, such drugs and draughts"
8382,CONSIDERED PER SE.,of the naval Pharmacopœia! Thrice happy civic simpleton who hath never
8383,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"learned how the rudder revolveth, at the risk of _turning round_"
8384,CONSIDERED PER SE.,himself!
8385,CONSIDERED PER SE.,
8386,CONSIDERED PER SE.,Vandergroot is visibly in course of transformation. At every visit
8387,CONSIDERED PER SE.,to the cabin he looks more and more like a Dutch-pin. He talks to me
8388,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"roundly, and gets blunter and blunter! The last time I felt, I had no"
8389,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"small to my back. If I may guess at my own figure, it is now about"
8390,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"an oval. I must look like one of Leda’s babies, just emerged, with"
8391,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"their insignificant buds of legs and arms, from the egg! From an oval"
8392,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"to a circle is but a step. Heaven help me when I get landed, round"
8393,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"and sound, as they say of cherries! How shall I get home--how get"
8394,CONSIDERED PER SE.,up--(there will be a short way down)--mine own stairs? How shall I sit?
8395,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"Instead of my old library chair, I must borrow its three-legged stool"
8396,CONSIDERED PER SE.,of the terrestrial globe!
8397,CONSIDERED PER SE.,
8398,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"Either my head swims, or the cabin is getting circular! I shall roll"
8399,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"about in it like a bolus in its box! If I am not merely giddy, I am"
8400,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"already as spherical as the earth; a little flatted, or so, that is,"
8401,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"towards the poles. What a horrible rough calm! I will down on my knees,"
8402,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"if I have knees, and with clasped hands, if hands remain to me, pray,"
8403,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"beg, and supplicate for a dismal storm to batter me into shape again,"
8404,CONSIDERED PER SE.,though it be but nine-bobble-square!
8405,CONSIDERED PER SE.,
8406,CONSIDERED PER SE.,I get more and more candid and communicative every moment. I can keep
8407,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"nothing to myself: you shall have my whole heart. I abhor, loathe,"
8408,CONSIDERED PER SE.,"execrate, the sea! If I could throw up my hat, my cry would be “Land"

8814,LOVE AND LUNACY.,He _gulp’d_ the words to hasten to their gist;
8815,LOVE AND LUNACY.,In mortal ecstasy his soul was bound--
8816,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"When, lo! with features all at once a-twist,"
8817,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"He gave a whistle, wild enough in sound"
8818,LOVE AND LUNACY.,To summon Faustus’s Infernal Hound!
8819,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8820,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Alas! what little miffs and tiffs in love,"
8821,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A snubbish word, or pouting look mistaken,"
8822,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Will loosen screws with sweethearts hand and glove,"
8823,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Oh! love, rock firm when chimney-pots were shaken,"
8824,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A pettish breath will into huffs awaken,"
8825,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"To spit like hump-back’d cats, and snarling Towzers!"
8826,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Till hearts are wreck’d and founder’d, and forsaken,"
8827,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"As ships go to Old Davy, Lord knows how, Sirs,"
8828,LOVE AND LUNACY.,While heav’n is blue enough for Dutchmen’s trowsers!
8829,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8830,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“The moon’s at full, love, and I think of you”--"
8831,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Who would have thought that such a kind P.S.
8832,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Could make a man turn white, then red, then blue,"
8833,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Then black, and knit his eyebrows and compress"
8834,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"His teeth, as if about to effervesce"
8835,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Like certain people when they lose at whist!
8836,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"So look’d the chafed Lorenzo, ne’ertheless,"
8837,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And, in a trice, the paper he had kiss’d"
8838,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Was crumpled like a snowball in his fist!
8839,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8840,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Ah! had he been less versed in scientifics,"
8841,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"More ignorant, in short, of what is what:"
8842,LOVE AND LUNACY.,He ne’er had flared up in such calorifics;
8843,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"But he _would_ seek societies, and trot"
8844,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"To clubs, Mechanics’ institutes, and got"
8845,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"With Birkbeck--Bartley--Combe--George Robins--Rennie,"
8846,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And other lecturing men. And had he not
8847,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"That work, of weekly parts, which sells so many,"
8848,LOVE AND LUNACY.,The Copper-bottomed Magazine--or “Penny?”
8849,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8850,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"But, of all learned pools whereon, or in,"
8851,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Men dive like dabchicks, or like swallows skim,"
8852,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Some hardly damp’d, some wetted to the skin,"
8853,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Some drown’d like pigs when they attempt to swim,"
8854,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Astronomy was most Lorenzo’s whim,"
8855,LOVE AND LUNACY.,(’Tis studied by a Prince amongst the Burmans);
8856,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"He loved those heavenly bodies which, the Hymn"
8857,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Of Addison declares, preach solemn sermons,"
8858,LOVE AND LUNACY.,While waltzing on their pivots like young Germans.
8859,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8860,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Night after night, with telescope in hand,"
8861,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Supposing that the night was fair and clear,"
8862,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Aloft, on the house-top, he took his stand,"
8863,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Till he obtained to know each twinkling sphere
8864,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Better, I doubt, than Milton’s “Starry Vere;”"
8865,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Thus, reading thro’ poor Ellen’s fond epistle,"
8866,LOVE AND LUNACY.,He soon espied the flaw--the lapse so sheer
8867,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"That made him raise his hair in such a bristle,"
8868,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And like the Boatswain of the Storm-Ship whistle.
8869,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8870,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“The moon’s at full, love, and I think of thee,”--"
8871,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“Indeed! I’m very much her humble debtor,"
8872,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"But not the moon-calf she would have me be,"
8873,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Zounds! does she fancy that I know no better?”
8874,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Herewith, at either corner of the letter"
8875,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"He gave a most ferocious, rending, pull;--"
8876,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“O woman! woman! that no vows can fetter,"
8877,LOVE AND LUNACY.,A moon to stay for three weeks at the full!
8878,LOVE AND LUNACY.,By Jove! a very pretty cock-and-bull!
8879,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8880,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“The moon at full! ’twas very finely reckon’d!
8881,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Why so she wrote me word upon the first--
8882,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The twelfth, and now upon the twenty-second--"
8883,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Full!--yes--it must be full enough to burst!
8884,LOVE AND LUNACY.,But let her go--of all vile jilts the worst”--
8885,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Here with his thumbs he gave contemptuous snaps,"
8886,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Anon he blubber’d like the child that’s nurs’d,"
8887,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And then he hit the table frightful raps,"
8888,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And stamped till he had broken both his straps.
8889,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8890,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“The moon’s at full--and I am in her thought--
8891,LOVE AND LUNACY.,No doubt; I do believe it in my soul!”
8892,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Here he threw up his head, and gave a snort"
8893,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Like a young horse first harness’d to a pole:
8894,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“The moon is full--aye, so is this d--d bowl!”"
8895,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And, grinning like the sourest of curmudgeons,"
8896,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Globe--water--fishes--he dash’d down the whole,"
8897,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Strewing the carpet with the gasping gudgeons;
8898,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Men do the strangest things in such love-dudgeons.
8899,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8900,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“I fill her thoughts--her memory’s vice-gerent?
8901,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"No, no,--some paltry puppy--three weeks old--"
8902,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And round as Norval’s shield”--thus incoherent
8903,LOVE AND LUNACY.,His fancies grew as he went on to scold;
8904,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"So stormy waves are into breakers roll’d,"
8905,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Work’d up at last to mere chaotic wroth--
8906,LOVE AND LUNACY.,This--that--heads--tails--thoughts jumbled uncontroll’d
8907,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"As onions, turnips, meat, in boiling broth,"
8908,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"By turns bob up, and splutter in the froth."
8909,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8910,LOVE AND LUNACY.,[Illustration: HOME’S DOUGLAS.]
8911,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8912,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“Fool that I was to let a baby face--
8913,LOVE AND LUNACY.,A full one--like a hunter’s--round and red--
8914,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Ass that I am, to give her more a place"
8915,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Within this heart”--and here he struck his head.
8916,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“’Sdeath are the Almanack-compilers dead?
8917,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"But no--’tis all an artifice--a trick,"
8918,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Some newer face--some dandy under-bred--
8919,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Well--be it so--of all the sex I’m sick!”
8920,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Here Juno wonder’d why she got a kick.
8921,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8922,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“‘The moon is full’--where’s her infernal scrawl?
8923,LOVE AND LUNACY.,‘And you are in my thought: that silver ray
8924,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Will ever your dear image thus recall’--
8925,LOVE AND LUNACY.,My image? Mine! She’d barter it away
8926,LOVE AND LUNACY.,For Pretty Poll’s on an Italian’s tray!
8927,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Three weeks, full weeks,--it is too plain--too bad--"
8928,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Too gross and palpable! Oh cursed day!
8929,LOVE AND LUNACY.,My senses have not crazed--but if they had--
8930,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Such moons would worry a Mad Doctor mad!
8931,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8932,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“Oh Nature! wherefore did you frame a lip
8933,LOVE AND LUNACY.,So fair for falsehood? Wherefore have you drest
8934,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Deceit so angel-like?” With sudden rip
8935,LOVE AND LUNACY.,He tore six new buff buttons from his vest
8936,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And groped with hand impetuous at his breast,"
8937,LOVE AND LUNACY.,As if some flea from Juno’s fleecy curls
8938,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Had skipp’d to batten on a human chest,"
8939,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"But no--the hand comes forth, and down it hurls"
8940,LOVE AND LUNACY.,A lady’s miniature beset with pearls.
8941,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8942,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Yet long upon the floor it did not tarry,"
8943,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Before another outrage could be plann’d:
8944,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Poor Juno, who had learn’d to fetch and carry,"
8945,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Pick’d up and brought it to her master’s hand,"
8946,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Who seized it, and the mimic feature scann’d;"
8947,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Yet not with the old loving ardent drouth,"
8948,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"He only saw in that fair face, so bland,"
8949,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Look how he would at it, east, west, north, south."
8950,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A moon, a full one, with eyes, nose, and mouth."
8951,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8952,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“I’ll go to her,”--herewith his hat he touch’d,"
8953,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And gave his arm a most heroic brandish;
8954,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“But no--I’ll write”--and here a spoon he clutch’d,"
8955,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And ramm’d it with such fury in the standish,"
8956,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A sable flood, like Niger the outlandish,"
8957,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Came rushing forth--Oh Antics and Buffoons!
8958,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Ye never danced a caper so ran-dan-dish;
8959,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"He jump’d, thump’d--tore--swore, more than ten dragoons,"
8960,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"At all nights, noons, moons, spoons, and pantaloons!"
8961,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8962,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"But soon ashamed, or weary, of such dancing,"
8963,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Without a Collinet’s or Weippert’s band,"
8964,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"His rampant arms and legs left off their prancing,"
8965,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And down he sat again, with pen in hand,"
8966,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Not fiddle-headed, or King’s-pattern grand,"
8967,LOVE AND LUNACY.,But one of Bramah’s patent Caligraphics;
8968,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And many a sheet it spoil’d before he plann’d
8969,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A likely letter. Used to pure seraphics,"
8970,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Philippics sounded strangely after Sapphics.
8971,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8972,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Long while he rock’d like Yankee in his chair,"
8973,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Staring as he would stare the wainscot through,"
8974,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And then he thrust his fingers in his hair,"
8975,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And set his crest up like a cockatoo;
8976,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And trampled with his hoofs, a mere Yahoo:"
8977,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"At last with many a tragic frown and start,"
8978,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"He penn’d a billet, very far from doux,"
8979,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"’Twas sour, severe--but think of a man’s smart"
8980,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Writing with lunar caustic on his heart!
8981,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8982,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The letter done and closed, he lit his taper,"
8983,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And sealing, as it were, his other mocks,"
8984,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"He stamped a grave device upon the paper,"
8985,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"No Cupid toying with his Psyche’s locks,"
8986,LOVE AND LUNACY.,But some stern head of the old Stoic stocks--
8987,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Then, fiercely striding through the staring streets,"
8988,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"He dropt the bitter missive in a box,"
8989,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Beneath the cakes and tarts, and sugar’d treats,"
8990,LOVE AND LUNACY.,In Mrs. Smelling’s window full of sweets.
8991,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8992,LOVE AND LUNACY.,[Illustration: BROKE BY A FALL OF THE STOCKS.]
8993,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
8994,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Soon sped the letter--thanks to modern plans,"
8995,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Our English mails run little in the style
8996,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Of those great German wild-beast caravans,"
8997,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"_Eil_-wagons--tho’ they do not “go like _ile_,”--"
8998,LOVE AND LUNACY.,But take a good twelve minutes to the mile--
8999,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"On Monday morning, just at ten o’clock,"
9000,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"As Ellen humm’d “The young May Moon” the while,"
9001,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Her ear was startled by that double knock
9002,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Which thrills the nerves like an electric shock!
9003,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9004,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Her right hand instantly forgot its cunning,"
9005,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And down into the street it dropt, or flung,"
9006,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Right on the hat and wig of Mr. Gunning,"
9007,LOVE AND LUNACY.,The jug that o’er her ten-week stocks had hung;
9008,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Then down the stairs by twos and threes she sprung,"
9009,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And through the passage like a burglar darted.
9010,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Alas! how sanguine are the fond and young--
9011,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"She little thought, when with the coin she parted,"
9012,LOVE AND LUNACY.,She paid a sixpence to be broken-hearted!
9013,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9014,LOVE AND LUNACY.,[Illustration: “WHEN WILL IT REACH LONDON?”]
9015,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9016,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Too dear at any price--had she but paid
9017,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Nothing and taken discount, it was dear;"
9018,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Yet, worthless as it was, the sweet-lipped maid"
9019,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Oft kissed the letter in her brief career
9020,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Between the lower and the upper sphere,"
9021,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Where, seated in a study bistre-brown,"
9022,LOVE AND LUNACY.,She tried to pierce a mystery as clear
9023,LOVE AND LUNACY.,As _that_ I saw once puzzling a young clown--
9024,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“Reading Made Easy,” but turned upside down."
9025,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9026,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Yet Ellen, like most Misses in the land,"
9027,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Had sipped sky blue, through certain of her teens,"
9028,LOVE AND LUNACY.,At one of those establishments which stand
9029,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"In highways, byeways, squares, and village greens;"
9030,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"’Twas called “The Grove,”--a name that always means"
9031,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Two poplars stand like sentries at the gate--
9032,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Each window had its close Venetian screens
9033,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And Holland blind, to keep in a cool state"
9034,LOVE AND LUNACY.,The twenty-four Young Ladies of Miss Bate.
9035,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9036,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"But when the screens were left unclosed by chance,"
9037,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The blinds not down, as if Miss B. were dead,"
9038,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Each upper window to a passing glance
9039,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Revealed a little dimity white bed;
9040,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Each lower one a cropp’d or curly head;
9041,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And thrice a week, for soul’s and health’s economies,"
9042,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Along the road the twenty four were led,"
9043,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Like coupled hounds, whipped in by two she-dominies"
9044,LOVE AND LUNACY.,With faces rather graver than Melpomene’s.
9045,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9046,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And thus their studies they pursued:--On Sunday,"
9047,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Beef, collects, batter, texts from Dr. Price;"
9048,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Mutton, French, pancakes, grammar--of a Monday;"
9049,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Tuesday--hard dumplings, globes, Chapone’s Advice;"
9050,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Wednesday--fancy-work, rice-milk (no spice);"
9051,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Thursday--pork, dancing, currant-bolsters, reading;"
9052,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Friday--beef, Mr. Butler, and plain rice;"
9053,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Saturday--scraps, short lessons and short feeding,"
9054,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Stocks, back-boards, hash, steel-collars, and good breeding"
9055,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9056,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"From this repertory of female learning,"
9057,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Came Ellen once a quarter, always fatter!"
9058,LOVE AND LUNACY.,To gratify the eyes of parents yearning.
9059,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"’Twas evident in bolsters, beef, and batter,"
9060,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Hard dumplings, and rice-milk, she did not smatter,"
9061,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"But heartily, as Jenkins says, “demollidge;”"
9062,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"But as for any learning, not to flatter,"
9063,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"As often happens when girls leave their college,"
9064,LOVE AND LUNACY.,She had done nothing but grow out of knowledge.
9065,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9066,LOVE AND LUNACY.,[Illustration: PRACTICE DRIVES ME MAD.]
9067,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9068,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"At Long Division sums she had no chance,"
9069,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And History was quite as bad a balk;
9070,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Her French it was too small for Petty France,"
9071,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And Priscian suffered in her English talk:
9072,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Her drawing might be done with cheese or chalk;
9073,LOVE AND LUNACY.,As for the globes--the use of the terrestrial
9074,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"She knew when she went out to take a walk,"
9075,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Or take a ride; but, touching the celestial,"
9076,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Her knowledge hardly soared above the bestial.
9077,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9078,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Nothing she learned of Juno, Pallas, Mars;"
9079,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Georgium, for what she knew, might stand for Burgo,"
9080,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Sidus, for Master: then, for northern stars,"
9081,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The Bear she fancied did in sable fur go,"
9082,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The Bull was Farmer Giles’s bull, and, ergo,"
9083,LOVE AND LUNACY.,The Ram the same that butted at her brother;
9084,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"As for the Twins, she only guessed that Virgo,"
9085,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"From coming after them, must be their mother;"
9086,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The Scales weighed soap, tea, figs, like any other."
9087,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9088,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"As ignorant as donkeys in Gallicia,"
9089,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"She thought that Saturn, with his Belt, was but"
9090,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A private, may be, in the Kent Militia;"
9091,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"That Charles’s Wain would stick in a deep rut,"
9092,LOVE AND LUNACY.,That Venus was a real West-End slut--
9093,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Oh, Gods and Goddesses of Greek Theogony!"
9094,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"That Berenice’s Hair would curl and cut,"
9095,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"That Cassiopëia’s Chair was good Mahogany,"
9096,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Nicely French-polished,--such was her cosmogony!"
9097,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9098,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Judge, then, how puzzled by the scientifics"
9099,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Lorenzo’s letter came now to dispense;
9100,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A lizard, crawling over hieroglyphics,"
9101,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Knows quite as much of their Egyptian sense;
9102,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A sort of London fog, opaque and dense,"
9103,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Hung over verbs, nouns, genitives, and datives."
9104,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"In vain she pored and pored, with eyes intense;"
9105,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"As well is known to oyster-operatives,"
9106,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Mere looking at the shells won’t open natives.
9107,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9108,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Yet mixed with the hard words, so called, she found"
9109,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Some easy ones that gave her heart the staggers:
9110,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Words giving tongue against her, like a hound"
9111,LOVE AND LUNACY.,At picking out a fault--words speaking daggers.
9112,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The very letters seemed, in hostile swaggers,"
9113,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"To lash their tails, but not as horses do,"
9114,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Nor like the tails of spaniels, gentle waggers,"
9115,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"But like a lion’s, ere he tears in two"
9116,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A black, to see if he is black all through."
9117,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9118,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"With open mouth, and eyeballs at full stretch,"
9119,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"She gazed upon the paper sad and sorry,"
9120,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"No sound--no stir--quite petrified, poor wretch!"
9121,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"As when Apollo, in old allegory,"
9122,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Down-stooping like a falcon, made his quarry"
9123,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Of Niobe, just turned to Purbeck stone;"
9124,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"In fact, since Cupid grew into a worry,"
9125,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Judge if a suing lover, let alone"
9126,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A lawyer, ever wrote in such a tone."
9127,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9128,LOVE AND LUNACY.,[Illustration: A POUTER.]
9129,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9130,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“Ellen, I will no longer call you mine,"
9131,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"That time is past, and ne’er can come again;"
9132,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"However other lights undimmed may shine,"
9133,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And undiminishing, one truth is plain,"
9134,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Which I, alas! have learned,--that love can wane."
9135,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The dream is pass’d away, the veil is rent,"
9136,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Your heart was not intended for my reign;
9137,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A sphere so full, I feel, was never meant"
9138,LOVE AND LUNACY.,With one poor man in it to be content.
9139,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9140,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“It must, no doubt, be pleasant beyond measure,"
9141,LOVE AND LUNACY.,To wander underneath the whispering bough
9142,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"With Dian, a perpetual round of pleasure."
9143,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Nay, fear not,--I absolve of every vow,--"
9144,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Use,--use your own celestial pleasure now,"
9145,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Your apogee and perigee arrange.
9146,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Herschel might aptly stare and wonder how,"
9147,LOVE AND LUNACY.,To me that constant disk has nothing strange--
9148,LOVE AND LUNACY.,A counterfeit is sometimes hard to change.
9149,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9150,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“Oh Ellen! I once little thought to write
9151,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Such words unto you, with so hard a pen;"
9152,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Yet outraged love will change its nature quite,"
9153,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And turn like tiger hunted to its den--
9154,LOVE AND LUNACY.,How Falsehood trips in her deceits on men!
9155,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And stands abash’d, discover’d, and forlorn!"
9156,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Had it been only cusp’d--but gibbous--then
9157,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"It had gone down--but Faith drew back in scorn,"
9158,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And would not swallow it--without a horn!
9159,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9160,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“I am in occultation,--that is plain:"
9161,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"My culmination’s past,--that’s quite as clear."
9162,LOVE AND LUNACY.,But think not I will suffer your disdain
9163,LOVE AND LUNACY.,To hang a lunar rainbow on a tear.
9164,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Whate’er my pangs, they shall be buried here;"
9165,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"No murmur,--not a sigh,--shall thence exhale:"
9166,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Smile on,--and for your own peculiar sphere"
9167,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Choose some eccentric path,--you cannot fail,"
9168,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And pray stick on a most portentous tail!
9169,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9170,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“Farewell! I hope you are in health and gay;
9171,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"For me, I never felt so well and merry--"
9172,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"As for the bran-new idol of the day,"
9173,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Monkey or man, I am indifferent--very!"
9174,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Nor e’en will ask who is the Happy Jerry;
9175,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"My jealousy is dead, or gone to sleep,"
9176,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"But let me hint that you will want a wherry,"
9177,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Three weeks’ spring-tide, and not a chance of neap,"
9178,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Your parlours will be flooded six feet deep!”
9179,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9180,LOVE AND LUNACY.,[Illustration: POND’S ASTRONOMY.]
9181,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9182,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“Oh Ellen! how delicious was that light
9183,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Wherein our plighted shadows used to blend,"
9184,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Meanwhile the melancholy bird of night--
9185,LOVE AND LUNACY.,No more of that----the lover’s at an end.
9186,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Yet if I may advise you, as a friend,"
9187,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Before you next pen sentiments so fond,"
9188,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Study your cycles--I would recommend
9189,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Our Airy--and let South be duly conn’d,"
9190,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And take a dip, I beg, in the great Pond."
9191,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9192,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“Farewell again! it is farewell for ever!
9193,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Before your lamp of night be lit up thrice,"
9194,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"I shall be sailing, haply, for Swan River,"
9195,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Jamaica, or the Indian land of rice,"
9196,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Or Boothia Felix--happy clime of ice!
9197,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"For Trebizond, or distant Scanderoon,"
9198,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Ceylon, or Java redolent of spice,"
9199,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Or settling, neighbour of the Cape baboon,"
9200,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Or roaming o’er--The Mountains of the Moon!
9201,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9202,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“What matters where? my world no longer owns
9203,LOVE AND LUNACY.,That dear meridian spot from which I dated
9204,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Degrees of distance, hemispheres, and zones,"
9205,LOVE AND LUNACY.,A globe all blank and barren and belated.
9206,LOVE AND LUNACY.,What matters where my future life be fated?
9207,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"With Lapland hordes, or Koords or Afric peasant,"
9208,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A squatter in the western woods located,"
9209,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"What matters where? My bias, at the present,"
9210,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Leans to the country that reveres the Crescent!
9211,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9212,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“Farewell! and if for ever, fare thee well!"
9213,LOVE AND LUNACY.,As wrote another of my fellow-martyrs:
9214,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"I ask no sexton for his passing-bell,"
9215,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"I do not ask your tear-drops to be starters,"
9216,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"However I may die, transfix’d by Tartars,"
9217,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"By Cobras poisoned, by Constrictors strangled,"
9218,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"By shark or cayman snapt above the garters,"
9219,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"By royal tiger or Cape lion mangled,"
9220,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Or starved to death in the wild woods entangled,"
9221,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9222,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“Or tortured slowly at an Indian stake,"
9223,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Or smother’d in the sandy hot simoom,"
9224,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Or crush’d in Chili by earth’s awful quake,"
9225,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Or baked in lava, a Vesuvian tomb,"
9226,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Or dirged by syrens and the billows’ boom
9227,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Or stiffen’d to a stock mid Alpine snows,"
9228,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Or stricken by the plague with sudden doom,"
9229,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Or suck’d by Vampyres to a last repose,"
9230,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Or self-destroy’d, impatient of my woes,"
9231,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9232,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“Still fare you well, however I may fare,"
9233,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A fare perchance to the Lethean shore,"
9234,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Caught up by rushing whirlwinds in the air,"
9235,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Or dash’d down cataracts with dreadful roar:
9236,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Nay, this warm heart, once yours unto the core,"
9237,LOVE AND LUNACY.,This hand you should have claim’d in church or minster
9238,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Some cannibal may gnaw”--she read no more--
9239,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Prone on the carpet fell the senseless spinster,"
9240,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Losing herself, as ’twere, in Kidderminster!"
9241,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9242,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Of course of such a fall the shock was great,"
9243,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"In rush’d the father, panting from the shop,"
9244,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"In rush’d the mother, without cap or tête,"
9245,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Pursued by Betty Housemaid with her mop;
9246,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The cook to change her apron did not stop,"
9247,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The charwoman next scrambled up the stair,--"
9248,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"All help to lift, to haul, to seat, to prop,"
9249,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And then they stand and smother round the chair,"
9250,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Exclaiming in a chorus, “Give her air!”"
9251,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9252,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"One sears her nostrils with a burning feather,"
9253,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Another rams a phial up her nose;
9254,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A third crooks all her finger-joints together,"
9255,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A fourth rips her up laces and her bows,"
9256,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"While all by turns keep trampling on her toes,"
9257,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And, when she gasps for breath, they pour in plump"
9258,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A sudden drench that down her thorax goes,"
9259,LOVE AND LUNACY.,As if in fetching her--some wits so jump--
9260,LOVE AND LUNACY.,She must be fetched with water like a pump!
9261,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9262,LOVE AND LUNACY.,[Illustration: “SHE’S BLACK IN THE FACE!”]
9263,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9264,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"No wonder that thus drench’d, and wrench’d, and gall’d,"
9265,LOVE AND LUNACY.,As soon as possible from syncope’s fetter
9266,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Her senses had the sense to be recall’d,"
9267,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“I’m better--that will do--indeed I’m better,”"
9268,LOVE AND LUNACY.,She cried to each importunate besetter;
9269,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Meanwhile, escaping from the stir and smother,"
9270,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The prudent parent seized the lover’s letter,"
9271,LOVE AND LUNACY.,(Daughters should have no secrets with a Mother)
9272,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And read it thro’ from one end to the other.
9273,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9274,LOVE AND LUNACY.,From first to last she never skipp’d a word--
9275,LOVE AND LUNACY.,For young Lorenzo of all youths was one
9276,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"So wise, so good, so moral she averr’d,"
9277,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"So clever, quite above the common run--"
9278,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"She made him sit by her, and call’d him son,"
9279,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"No matrimonial suit, e’en Duke’s or Earl’s,"
9280,LOVE AND LUNACY.,So flatter’d her maternal feelings--none!
9281,LOVE AND LUNACY.,For mothers always think young men are pearls
9282,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Who come and throw themselves before their girls.
9283,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9284,LOVE AND LUNACY.,[Illustration: DECAPITATION.]
9285,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9286,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And now, at warning signal from her finger,"
9287,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The servants most reluctantly withdrew,"
9288,LOVE AND LUNACY.,But list’ning on the stairs contrived to linger;
9289,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"For Ellen, gazing round with eyes of blue,"
9290,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"At last the features of her parent knew,"
9291,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And summoning her breath and vocal pow’rs,"
9292,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“Oh, mother!” she exclaimed--“Oh, is it true--"
9293,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Our dear Lorenzo”--the dear name drew show’rs--
9294,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“_Ours_,” cried the mother, “pray don’t call him ours!”"
9295,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9296,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“I never liked him, never, in my days!”"
9297,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"[“Oh yes--you did”--said Ellen with a sob,]"
9298,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“There always _was_ a something in his ways--”
9299,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"[“So sweet--so kind,” said Ellen, with a throb,]"
9300,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“His very face was what I call a snob,"
9301,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And, spite of West-end coats and pantaloons,"
9302,LOVE AND LUNACY.,He had a sort of air of the swell mob;
9303,LOVE AND LUNACY.,I’m sure when he has come of afternoons
9304,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"To tea, I’ve often thought--I’ll watch my spoons!”"
9305,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9306,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“The spoons!” cried Ellen, almost with a scream,"
9307,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“Oh cruel--false as cruel--and unjust!
9308,LOVE AND LUNACY.,He that once stood so high in your esteem!”
9309,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“He!” cried the dame, grimacing her disgust,"
9310,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“I like him?--yes--as any body must
9311,LOVE AND LUNACY.,An infidel that scoffs at God and Devil:
9312,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Didn’t he bring you Bonaparty’s bust?
9313,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Lord! when he calls I hardly can be civil--
9314,LOVE AND LUNACY.,_My_ favourite was always Mr. Neville.
9315,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9316,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“Lorenzo?--I should like, of earthly things,"
9317,LOVE AND LUNACY.,To see him hanging forty cubits high;
9318,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Doesn’t he write like Captain Rocks and Swings?
9319,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Nay, in this very letter bid you try"
9320,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"To make yourself particular, and tie"
9321,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A tail on--a prodigious tail!--Oh, daughter!"
9322,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And don’t he ask you down his area--fie!
9323,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And recommend to cut your being shorter,"
9324,LOVE AND LUNACY.,With brick-bats round your neck in ponds of water?”
9325,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9326,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Alas! to think how readers thus may vary
9327,LOVE AND LUNACY.,A writer’s sense!--What mortal would have thought
9328,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Lorenzo’s hint about Professor Airy
9329,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And Pond to such a likeness could be brought!
9330,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Who would have dreamt the simple way he taught
9331,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"To make a comet of poor Ellen’s moon,"
9332,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Could furnish forth an image so distraught,"
9333,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"As Ellen, walking Regent Street at noon,"
9334,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Tail’d--like a fat Cape sheep, or a racoon!"
9335,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9336,LOVE AND LUNACY.,[Illustration: “STICK AS YOU BE--THAT’S THE COMET.”]
9337,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9338,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And yet, whate’er absurdity the brains"
9339,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"May hatch, it ne’er wants wet-nurses to suckle it!"
9340,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Or dry ones, like a hen, to take the pains"
9341,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"To lead the nudity abroad, and chuckle it;"
9342,LOVE AND LUNACY.,No whim so stupid but some fool will buckle it
9343,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"To jingle bell-like on his empty head,"
9344,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"No mental mud--but some will knead and knuckle it,"
9345,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And fancy they are making fancy-bread;--
9346,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"No ass has written, but some ass has read."
9347,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9348,LOVE AND LUNACY.,No dolts could lead if others did not follow ’em.
9349,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"No Hahnémann could give decillionth drops,"
9350,LOVE AND LUNACY.,If any man could not be got to swallow ’em;
9351,LOVE AND LUNACY.,But folly never comes to such full stops.
9352,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"As soon, then, as the Mother made such swaps"
9353,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Of all Lorenzo’s meanings, heads and tails,"
9354,LOVE AND LUNACY.,The Father seized upon her malaprops--
9355,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“My girl down areas--of a night! ’Ods nails!
9356,LOVE AND LUNACY.,I’ll stick the scoundrel on his area-rails!”

9365,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And doubling to a fist each ample hand,"
9366,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The empty air he boxed with, a-la-Bitton,"
9367,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"As if in training for a fight, long plann’d,"
9368,LOVE AND LUNACY.,With Nobody--for love--at No Man’s Land!

9370,LOVE AND LUNACY.,[Illustration: A FOWL WIND.]
9371,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9372,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“I’ll pond--I’ll tail him!”--In a voice of thunder
9373,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"He recommenced his fury and his fuss,"
9374,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Loud, open-mouth’d, and wedded to his blunder,"
9375,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Like one of those great guns that end in buss.
9376,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“I’ll teach him to write ponds and tails to us!”
9377,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"But while so menacing this-that-and-t’others,"
9378,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"His wife broke in with certain truths, as thus:"
9379,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“Men are not women--fathers can’t be mothers,--"
9380,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Females are females”--and a few such others.
9381,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9382,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"So saying, with rough nudges, willy-nilly,"
9383,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"She hustled him outside the chamber-door,"
9384,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Looking, it must be own’d, a little silly;"
9385,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And then she did as the Carinthian boor
9386,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Serves (Goldsmith says) the traveller that’s poor!
9387,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"_Id est_, she shut him in the outer space,"
9388,LOVE AND LUNACY.,With just as much apology--no more--
9389,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"As Boreas would present in such a case,"
9390,LOVE AND LUNACY.,For slamming the street door right in your face.
9391,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9392,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And now, the secrets of the sex thus kept,"
9393,LOVE AND LUNACY.,What passed in that important tête-à-tête
9394,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"’Twixt dam and daughter, nobody except"
9395,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Paul Pry, or his Twin Brother, could narrate--"
9396,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"So turn we to Lorenzo, left of late,"
9397,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"In front of Mrs. Snelling’s sugar’d snacks,"
9398,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"In such a very waspish stinging state,"
9399,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"But now at the Old Dragon, stretch’d on racks,"
9400,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Fretting, and biting down his nails to tacks;"
9401,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9402,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Because that new fast four-inside--the Comet,"
9403,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Instead of keeping its appointed time,"
9404,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Had deviated some few minutes from it,"
9405,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A thing with all astronomers a crime,"
9406,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And he had studied in that lore sublime;
9407,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Nor did his heat get any less or shorter
9408,LOVE AND LUNACY.,For pouring upon passion’s unslaked lime
9409,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A well-grown glass of Cogniac and water,"
9410,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Mix’d stiff as starch by the Old Dragon’s daughter.
9411,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9412,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"At length, “Fair Ellen” sounding with a flourish,"
9413,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The Comet came all bright, bran new, and smart:"
9414,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Meanwhile the melody conspired to nourish
9415,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The hasty spirit in Lorenzo’s heart,"
9416,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And soon upon the roof he “topped his part,”"
9417,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Which never had a more impatient man on,"
9418,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Wishing devoutly that the steeds would start
9419,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Like lightning greased,--or, as at Ballyshannon"
9420,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Sublimed, “greased lightning shot out of a cannon.”"
9421,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9422,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"For, ever since the letter left his hand,"
9423,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"His mind had been in vacillating motion,"
9424,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Dodge-dodging like a fluster’d crab on land,"
9425,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"That cannot ask its way, and has no notion"
9426,LOVE AND LUNACY.,If right or left leads to the German Ocean--
9427,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Hatred and Love by turns enjoy’d monopolies,"
9428,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Till, like a Doctor following his own potion,"
9429,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Before a learned pig could spell Acropolis,"
9430,LOVE AND LUNACY.,He went and booked himself for our metropolis.
9431,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9432,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“Oh, for a horse,” or rather four,--“with wings!”"
9433,LOVE AND LUNACY.,For so he put the wish into the plural--
9434,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"No relish he retained for country things,"
9435,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"He could not join felicity with rural,"
9436,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"His thoughts were all with London and the mural,"
9437,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Where architects--not paupers--heap and _pile_ stones;
9438,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Or with the horses’ muscles, called the crural,"
9439,LOVE AND LUNACY.,How fast they could macadamize the milestones
9440,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Which pass’d as tediously as gall or bile stones.
9441,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9442,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Blind to the picturesque, he ne’er perceived"
9443,LOVE AND LUNACY.,In Nature one artistical fine stroke;
9444,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"For instance, how that purple hill relieved"
9445,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The beggar-woman in the gipsy-poke,"
9446,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And how the red cow carried off her cloak;
9447,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Or how the aged horse, so gaunt and grey,"
9448,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Threw off a noble mass of beech and oak!
9449,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Or, how the tinker’s ass, beside the way,"
9450,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Came boldly out from a white cloud--to bray!
9451,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9452,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Such things have no delight for worried men,"
9453,LOVE AND LUNACY.,That travel full of care and anxious smart:
9454,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Coachmen and horses, are your artists then:"
9455,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Just try a team of draughtsmen with the Dart,"
9456,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Take Shee, for instance, Etty, Jones, and Hart,"
9457,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Let every neck be put into its noose,"
9458,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Then tip ’em on the flank to make ’em start,"
9459,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And see how they will draw!--Four screws let loose
9460,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Would make a difference--or I’m a goose!
9461,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9462,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Nor cared he more about the promised crops,"
9463,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"If oats were looking up, or wheat was laid,"
9464,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"For flies in turnip, or a blight in hops,"
9465,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Or how the barley prosper’d or decay’d;
9466,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"In short, no items of the farming trade."
9467,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Peas, beans, tares, ’taters, could his mind beguile;"
9468,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Nor did he answer to the servant maid,"
9469,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"That always asked at every other mile,"
9470,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“Where do we change, Sir?” with her sweetest smile."
9471,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9472,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"[Illustration: “LORD, JOHN, HERE’S A BURROW!”]"
9473,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9474,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Nor more he listened to the Politician,"
9475,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Who lectured on his left, a formal prig,"
9476,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Of Belgium’s, Greece’s, Turkey’s sad condition,"
9477,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Not worth a cheese, an olive, or a fig;"
9478,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Nor yet unto the critic, fierce and big,"
9479,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Who, holding forth, all lonely, in his glory,"
9480,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Called one a sad bad Poet--and a Whig,"
9481,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And one, a first-rate proser--and a Tory;"
9482,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"So critics judge, now, of a song or story."
9483,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9484,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Nay, when the coachman spoke about the ’Leger,"
9485,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Of Popsy, Mopsy, Bergamotte, and Civet,"
9486,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Of breeder, trainer, owner, backer, hedger,"
9487,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And nags as right, or righter than a trivet,"
9488,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The theme his crack’d attention could not rivet,"
9489,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Though leaning forward to the man of whips,"
9490,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"He seem’d to give an ear,--but did not give it,"
9491,LOVE AND LUNACY.,For Ellen’s moon (that saddest of her slips)
9492,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Would not be hidden by a “new Eclipse.”
9493,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9494,LOVE AND LUNACY.,[Illustration: THE HEAD WAITER AT HATCHETT’S.]
9495,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9496,LOVE AND LUNACY.,If any thought e’er flitted in his head
9497,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Belonging to the sphere of Bland and Crocky,"
9498,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"It was to wish the team all thorough-bred,"
9499,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And every buckle on their backs a jockey:
9500,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"When spinning down a steep descent, or rocky,"
9501,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"He never watch’d the wheel, and long’d to lock it,"
9502,LOVE AND LUNACY.,He liked the bolters that set off so cocky:
9503,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Nor did it shake a single nerve or shock it
9504,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Because the Comet raced against the Rocket.
9505,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9506,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Thanks to which rivalry, at last the journey"
9507,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Finish’d an hour and a quarter under time,"
9508,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Without a case for surgeon or attorney,"

9510,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And now, descending from his seat sublime,"
9511,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Behold Lorenzo, weariest of wights,"
9512,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"In that great core of brick, and stone, and lime,"
9513,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Call’d England’s Heart--but which, as seen of nights,"

9520,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"With fruit, knives, pencils,--all dirt cheap of course,"
9521,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Coachmen, and hawkers of the Globe and “Currier;”"
9522,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Away!--the cookmaid is not such a skurrier,"
9523,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"When, fit to split her gingham as she goes,"
9524,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"With six just striking on the clock to hurry her,"
9525,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"She strides along with one of her three beaux,"
9526,LOVE AND LUNACY.,To get well placed at “Ashley’s”--now Ducrow’s.
9527,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9528,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“I wonder if her moon is full to-night!”
9529,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"He mutter’d, jealous as a Spanish Don,"
9530,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"When, lo!--to aggravate that inward spite,"
9531,LOVE AND LUNACY.,In glancing at a board he spied thereon
9532,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A play-bill for dramatic folks to con,"
9533,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"In letters such as those may read, who run,"
9534,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“‘KING JOHN’--oh yes,--I recollect King John!"
9535,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"‘My Lord, they say five moons’--_five_ moons!--well done!"
9536,LOVE AND LUNACY.,I wonder Ellen was content with one!
9537,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9538,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“Five moons--all full!--and all at once in heav’n!
9539,LOVE AND LUNACY.,She should have lived in that prolific reign!”
9540,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Here he arrived in front of number seven,"
9541,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Th’ abode of all his joy and all his pain;
9542,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A sudden tremor shot through every vein,"
9543,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"He wish’d he’d come up by the heavy waggon,"
9544,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And felt an impulse to turn back again,"
9545,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Oh, that he ne’er had quitted the Old Dragon!"
9546,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Then came a sort of longing for a flagon.
9547,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9548,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"His tongue and palate seem’d so parch’d with drouth,--"
9549,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The very knocker fill’d his soul with dread,"
9550,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"As if it had a living lion’s mouth,"
9551,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"With teeth so terrible, and tongue so red,"
9552,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"In which he had engaged to put his head,"
9553,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The bell-pull turn’d his courage into vapour,"
9554,LOVE AND LUNACY.,As though ’t would cause a shower-bath to shed
9555,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Its thousand shocks, to make him sigh and caper--"
9556,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"He look’d askance, and did not like the scraper."
9557,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9558,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“What business have I here? (he thought) a dunce
9559,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A hopeless passion thus to fan and foster,"
9560,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Instead of putting out its wick at once;
9561,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"She’s gone--it’s very evident I’ve lost her,--"
9562,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And to the wanton wind I should have toss’d her--
9563,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Pish! I will leave her with her moon, at ease,"
9564,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"To toast and eat it, like a single Gloster,"
9565,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Or cram some fool with it, as good green cheese,"
9566,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Or make a honey-moon, if so she please."
9567,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9568,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“Yes--here I leave her,” and as thus he spoke,"
9569,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"He plied the knocker with such needless force,"
9570,LOVE AND LUNACY.,It almost split the panel of sound oak;
9571,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And then he went as wildly through a course
9572,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Of ringing, till he made abrupt divorce"
9573,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Between the bell and its dumfounded handle,"
9574,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Whilst up ran Betty, out of breath and hoarse,"
9575,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And thrust into his face her blown-out candle,"
9576,LOVE AND LUNACY.,To recognise the author of such scandal.
9577,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9578,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Who, presto! cloak, and carpet-bag to boot,"
9579,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Went stumbling, rumbling, up the dark one pair,"
9580,LOVE AND LUNACY.,With other noise than his whose “very foot
9581,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Had music in’t as he came up the stair:”
9582,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And then with no more manners than a bear,"
9583,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"His hat upon his head, no matter how,"
9584,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"No modest tap his presence to declare,"
9585,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"He bolted in a room, without a bow,"
9586,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And there sat Ellen, with a marble brow!"
9587,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9588,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Like fond Medora, watching at her window,"
9589,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Yet not of any Corsair bark in search--
9590,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The jutting lodging-house of Mrs. Lindo,"
9591,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“The Cheapest House in Town” of Todd and Sturch.
9592,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The private house of Reverend Doctor Birch,"
9593,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"The public-house, closed nightly at eleven,"
9594,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"And then that house of prayer, the parish church,"
9595,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Some roofs, and chimneys, and a glimpse of heaven,"
9596,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Made up the whole look-out of Number Seven.
9597,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9598,LOVE AND LUNACY.,[Illustration: “MEET ME BY MOONLIGHT ALONE.”]
9599,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9600,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Yet something in the prospect so absorbed her,"
9601,LOVE AND LUNACY.,She seemed quite drowned and dozing in a dream;
9602,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"As if her own belov’d full moon still orb’d her,"
9603,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Lulling her fancy in some lunar scheme,"
9604,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"With lost Lorenzo, may be, for its theme--"
9605,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Yet when Lorenzo touch’d her on the shoulder,"
9606,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"She started up with an abortive scream,"
9607,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"As if some midnight ghost, from regions colder,"
9608,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Had come within his bony arms to fold her.
9609,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9610,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“Lorenzo!” “Ellen!” then came “Sir!” and “Madam!”
9611,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"They tried to speak, but hammer’d at each word,"
9612,LOVE AND LUNACY.,As if it were a flint for great Mac Adam:
9613,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Such broken English never else was heard,"
9614,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"For like an aspen leaf each nerve was stirr’d,"
9615,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"A chilly tremor thrill’d them through and through,"
9616,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Their efforts to be stiff were quite absurd,"
9617,LOVE AND LUNACY.,They shook like jellies made without a due
9618,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And proper share of common joiner’s glue.
9619,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9620,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“Ellen! I’m come--to bid you--fare--farewell!”
9621,LOVE AND LUNACY.,They thus began to fight their verbal duel;
9622,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“Since some more hap--hap--happy man must dwell--”
9623,LOVE AND LUNACY.,“Alas--Loren--Lorenzo!--cru--cru--cruel!”
9624,LOVE AND LUNACY.,For so they split their words like grits for gruel.
9625,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"At last the Lover, as he long had plann’d,"
9626,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Drew out that once inestimable jewel,"
9627,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Her portrait, which was erst so fondly scann’d,"
9628,LOVE AND LUNACY.,And thrust poor Ellen’s face into her hand.
9629,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9630,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"“There--take it, Madam--take it back, I crave,"

9663,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"For of the various themes that left his mouth,"
9664,LOVE AND LUNACY.,One half surpass’d her intellectual climb:
9665,LOVE AND LUNACY.,She knew no more than the old Hill of Howth
9666,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"About that “Children of a larger growth,”"
9667,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Who notes proceedings of the F. R. S.’s;

9670,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"Nay, Bartley’s Orrery defied her guesses."
9671,LOVE AND LUNACY.,
9672,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Howbeit some notion of his jealous drift
9673,LOVE AND LUNACY.,"She gather’d from the simple outward fact,"
9674,LOVE AND LUNACY.,That her own lap contained each slighted gift;
9675,LOVE AND LUNACY.,Though quite unconscious of his cause to act

9793,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"IT may not, or rather it cannot, be generally known, that an attempt"
9794,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"was made last winter, by certain influential members of the Society of"
9795,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"Friends, to establish a Conversazione at Tottenham, a neighbourhood"
9796,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,especially favoured by that respectable and substantial sect. The idea
9797,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,originated with a junior female branch of the opulent family of the
9798,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"Mumfords, which has been seated, time out of mind, in the vicinity"
9799,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,of Bruce Castle; the notion was broached to a select few of the
9800,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"sisterhood, during a Sabbath walk homewards from the conventicle: the"
9801,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"suggestion was relished; and a conference was called, at which the"
9802,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"scheme was seriously brought forward, and gravely considered. At first"
9803,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"there was a little boggling at the proposed title, as savouring, it was"
9804,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"thought, of Loquacity; but the objection was dropped, on an explanation"
9805,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"that although the word implied conversation, no one would be bidden to"
9806,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"discourse against their own inclination; nay that, even amongst other"
9807,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"persuasions, the conversazioni were frequently as distant as possible"
9808,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"from a Negro “Talk,” or a Red Indian “Palaver.” This little demur"
9809,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"excepted, the plan went on swimmingly, and was finally adopted with the"
9810,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"subdued hum which, in that quiet-loving community, is equivalent to"
9811,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"acclamations. A secretary was formally proposed, and tacitly chosen"
9812,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"unanimously; being no other than the fair Foundress herself, the"
9813,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,mild-spoken and meek-eyed Ruth Mumford. A few brief rules were then
9814,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"drawn up, and, after no debate, agreed to--some of them, considering"
9815,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"the constitutional taciturnity of the sect, being sufficiently"
9816,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"superfluous, as guarding against what Bubb Doddington called “a"
9817,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"multiplicity of talk.” For instance, the 9th rule provided, that “no"
9818,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"brother or sister should indulge in rambling irrelevant discourse,"
9819,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"embracing a profusion of topics, wide of the matter in hand.” The"
9820,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"10th, that “no two or more Friends should disburden themselves of"
9821,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"speech at one and the same time;” and the 12th, that “no member of this"
9822,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"society shall deliver himself or herself with unreasonable continuity,"
9823,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,to the prevention of other Friends who might desire to speak to the
9824,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,matter.” From the list of subjects to be “spoken to” politics and
9825,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"polemics were excluded; but poetry was allowed, or at least connived"
9826,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"at, the excellent example of Bernard Barton and the Howitts having"
9827,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"happily relaxed the primitive rigour of that proscription. Besides,"
9828,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"it was well known, between Friends, that several of the younger"
9829,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"female members, the fair secretary included, occasionally struck, or"
9830,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"rather, as Quakers ought not to strike anything, twanged the lyre."
9831,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"For the rest, the society was modelled after other private literary"
9832,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"associations; it was to meet twice weekly, visiting the houses of the"
9833,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"members in rotation, when original essays or papers were to be read,"
9834,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"and afterwards discussed; provided always, that they afforded any"
9835,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"Debateable Land to make a stand upon, seeing that at the end of the"
9836,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"rules and regulations, a special article earnestly recommended, that in"
9837,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,the selection of subjects all such topics should be avoided “as might
9838,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,lead to differences of opinion amongst the brethren.”
9839,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,
9840,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,Such was--for it is defunct--the Tottenham Friends’ Conversazione; of
9841,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"whose existence I became aware but by accident. It was my good fortune,"
9842,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"till lately, to live next door to a family of Quakers, and to make"
9843,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"acquaintance with the eldest daughter, a young lively maiden just"
9844,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,wearing out the last of her teens. I am afraid in the austere brown
9845,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,eyes of her parents she was not strictly considered as the flower of
9846,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"their flock, being a sort of nonconformist among nonconformists, as"
9847,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"was especially to be seen in comparing her with her younger sisters,"
9848,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"who seemed to have been brought up, or stuck up, under the most"
9849,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"starched discipline. Instead of their plain close caps,--mere casts of"
9850,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"their skulls taken in muslin,--she wore an airy fanciful structure of"
9851,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"blonde and white ribbon, that a Parisian woman might have put on--at"
9852,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"least of a morning. In lieu of their sleek mohair braids, her auburn"
9853,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,ringlets flowed down her neck in all the “Unloveliness of Love-locks.”
9854,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,To her star-like hazel eyes she allowed a little planetary liberty
9855,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"of circulation; whereas it seemed the object of the others, to keep"
9856,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"their demure brown orbs as immoveable in their faces, as bad halfpence"
9857,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"nailed to counters. Instead of screwing up her lips, as if she had"
9858,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"just come, minus a masticator, out of Cartwright’s into an east wind,"
9859,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"she sometimes gave her ivory teeth an airing, by smiling at some"

9864,THE QUAKERS’ CONVERSAZIONE.,"olives, slates, and snuffy browns,--shapes which nature makes on her"

10106,THE MORNING CALL.,"Hollow, the fleecy clouds seem like blankets, the lakes and ponds are"

10109,THE MORNING CALL.,lining feels softlier squabbed; the guard’s horn plays “Lullaby.” Every
10110,THE MORNING CALL.,flower by the road-side is a poppy. Each jolt of the coach is but a
10111,THE MORNING CALL.,drowsy stumble up stairs. The lady opposite is the chamber-maid; the
10112,THE MORNING CALL.,gentleman beside her is Boots. He slides into imaginary slippers; he
10113,THE MORNING CALL.,"winks and nods flirtingly at Sleep, so soon to be his own. Although the"

10147,THE MORNING CALL.,fast as a fast post-coach in my four-poster--or rather I must have
10148,THE MORNING CALL.,"slept “like winkin,” for I seemed hardly to have closed my eyes, when a"

10166,THE MORNING CALL.,
10167,THE MORNING CALL.,Boots acted according to orders. I jumped out of bed--pocketed my
10168,THE MORNING CALL.,nightcap--screwed on my stockings--plunged into my trowsers--rammed
10169,THE MORNING CALL.,my feet into wrong right and left boots--tumbled down the back
10170,THE MORNING CALL.,"stairs--burst through a door, and found myself in the fresh air of"
10171,THE MORNING CALL.,"the stable-yard, holding a lantern, which, in sheer haste, or spleen,"
10172,THE MORNING CALL.,"I pitched into the horsepond. Then began the race, during which I"
10173,THE MORNING CALL.,"completed my toilet, running and firing a verbal volley at Boots, as"
10174,THE MORNING CALL.,often as I could spare breath for one.
10175,THE MORNING CALL.,
10176,THE MORNING CALL.,“And you call this waking me up--for the coach. My waistcoat!--Why I

10182,THE MORNING CALL.,
10183,THE MORNING CALL.,I paused for wind; while Boots had stopped of his own accord. We
10184,THE MORNING CALL.,"had turned a corner into a small square; and on the opposite side,"
10185,THE MORNING CALL.,"certainly stood an inn with the sign of the Dragon, but without"
10186,THE MORNING CALL.,"any sign of a coach at the door. Boots stood beside me aghast, and"
10187,THE MORNING CALL.,surveying the house from the top to the bottom; not a wreath of smoke
10188,THE MORNING CALL.,"came from a chimney; the curtains were closed over every window,"
10189,THE MORNING CALL.,and the door was closed and shuttered. I could hardly contain my
10190,THE MORNING CALL.,indignation when I looked at the infernal somnolent visage of the
10191,THE MORNING CALL.,"fellow, hardly yet broad awake--he kept rubbing his black-lead eyes"
10192,THE MORNING CALL.,"with his hands, as if he would have rubbed them out."

10198,THE MORNING CALL.,"“No, there be no coach, sure enough,” soliloquised Boots, slowly"
10199,THE MORNING CALL.,"raising his eyes from the road, where he had been searching for the"

10201,THE MORNING CALL.,"on my face. “No, there’s no coach--I ax a thousand pardons, your"

10557,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,such abortions seem sufficiently unaccountable. A great hulking
10558,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"fellow, revelling as De Quincey used emphatically to say, “in rude"
10559,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"BOVINE health,”--a voracious human animal, camel-stomached and"
10560,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"iron-built, who could all but devour and digest himself like a Kilkenny"
10561,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"cat,--can neither sympathise with nor understand those frequent"
10562,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,failures and down-breakings which happen to beings not so fortunately
10563,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,gifted with indelicate constitutions. Such a half-horse half-alligator
10564,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"monster cannot judge, like a _Puny_ Judge, of a case of feebleness. The"
10565,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,broad-chested cannot allow for the narrow-breasted; the robust for the
10566,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"no-bust. Nevertheless, even the stalwart may sometimes fall egregiously"
10567,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,short of their own designs--as witness a case in point.
10568,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10569,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Amongst my fellow passengers, on a late sea-voyage, there was one who"
10570,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"attracted my especial attention. A glance at his face, another at his"
10571,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"figure, a third at his costume, and a fourth at his paraphernalia,"
10572,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"sufficed to detect his country: by his light hair, nubbly features,"
10573,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"heavy frame, odd-coloured dressing-gown, and the national meerschaum"
10574,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and gaudy tobacco-bag, he was undeniably a German. But, besides"
10575,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the everlasting pipe, he was provided with a sketching apparatus,"
10576,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"an ample note book, a gun, and a telescope; the whole being placed"
10577,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"ready for immediate use. He had predetermined, no doubt, to record"
10578,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,his German sentiments on first making acquaintance with the German
10579,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Ocean; to sketch the picturesque craft he might encounter on its
10580,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,surface; to shoot his first sea-gull; and to catch a first glimpse of
10581,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the shores of Albion, beyond the reach of the naked eye. But alas!"
10582,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,all these intentions fell--if one may correctly say so with only
10583,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,sky and water--to the ground. He ate nothing--drank nothing--smoked
10584,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"nothing--drew nothing--wrote nothing--shot nothing--spied nothing--nay,"
10585,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"he merely stared, but replied nothing to my friendly inquiry (I am ill"
10586,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,at the German tongue and its pronunciation) “Wie befinden _sea sick_?”
10587,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10588,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Now, my own case, gentle reader, has been precisely akin to that of our"
10589,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"unfortunate Cousin German. Like him I have promised much, projected"
10590,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"still more, and done little. Like him, too, I have been a sick man,"
10591,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"though not at sea, but on shore--and in excuse of all that has been"
10592,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"left undone, or delayed, with other Performers, when they do not"
10593,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"perform, I must proffer the old theatrical plea of indisposition. As"
10594,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the Rambler describes, I have erected schemes which have been blown"
10595,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"down by an _ill_ wind; I have formed plans, and been weather-beaten,"
10596,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"like another Murphy, by a change in the weather. For instance, the"
10597,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Comic Annual for 1839 ought properly to have been published some forty
10598,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"days earlier; but was obliged, as it were, to perform quarantine, for"
10599,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"want of a clean Bill of Health. Thus, too, the patron of the present"
10600,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Work who has taken the trouble to peruse certain chapters under the
10601,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"title of Literary Reminiscences, will doubtless have compared the tone"
10602,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of them with an Apology in Number Six, wherein, declining any attempt"
10603,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"at an Auto-biography, a promise was made of giving such anecdotes as"
10604,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,a bad memory and a bad hearing might have retained of my literary
10605,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"friends and acquaintance. Hitherto, however, the fragments in question"
10606,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,have only presented desultory glimpses of a goose quill still in its
10607,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"green-gosling-hood, instead of any recollections of “celebrated pens.”"
10608,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,The truth is that my malady forced me to temporise:--wherefore the
10609,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,kind reader will be pleased to consider the aforesaid chapters but as
10610,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"so many “false starts,” and that Memory has only now got away, to make"
10611,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,play as well as she can.
10612,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10613,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Whilst I am thus closeted in the Confessional, it may be as well, as"
10614,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the Pelican said, to make a clean breast of it, and at once plead"
10615,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,guilty to all those counts--and some from long-standing have become
10616,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,very Old Bailey counts--that haunt my conscience. The most numerous
10617,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of these crimes relate to letters that would not, could not, or at"
10618,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"least did not answer. Others refer to the receipt of books, and as an"
10619,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,example of their heinousness it misgives me that I was favoured with a
10620,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"little volume by W. and M. Howitt, without ever telling them _how-it_"
10621,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"pleased me. A few offences, concern engagements which it was impossible"
10622,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"to fulfil, although doubly bound by principle and interest. Seriously"
10623,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"I have perforce been guilty of many, many, and still many sins of"
10624,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"omission: but Hope, reviving with my strength, promises, granting me"
10625,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"life, to redeem all such pledges. In the mean time, in extenuation,"
10626,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"I can only plead particularly that deprecation which is offered up,"
10627,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"in behalf of all Christian defaulters every Sunday,--“We have left"
10628,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"undone those things which we ought to have done,--_And there is no_"
10629,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,HEALTH _in us_.”
10630,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10631,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"It is pleasant after a match at Chess, particularly if we have won,"
10632,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"to try back, and reconsider those important moves which have had a"
10633,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"decisive influence on the result. It is still more interesting, in the"
10634,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"game of Life, to recall the critical positions which have occurred"
10635,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"during its progress, and review the false or judicious steps that have"
10636,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"led to our subsequent good or ill fortune. There is, however, this"
10637,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"difference, that chess is a matter of pure skill and calculation,"
10638,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"whereas, the chequered board of human life is subject to the caprice"
10639,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,of Chance--the event being sometimes determined by combinations which
10640,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,never entered into the mind of the player[4]. To such an accident it
10641,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,is perhaps attributable that the hand now tracing these reminiscences
10642,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,is holding a pen instead of an etching-point; jotting down these prose
10643,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"pleasures of memory, in lieu of furnishing articles “plated-on-steel,”"
10644,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,for the pictorial periodicals.
10645,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10646,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"It will be remembered that my mental constitution, however weak my"
10647,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"physical one, was proof against that type-us fever which parches most"
10648,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"scribblers till they are set up, done up, and may-be, cut-up, in print"
10649,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and boards. Perhaps I had read, and trembled at the melancholy annals"
10650,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of those unfortunates who, rashly undertaking to write for bread,"
10651,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"had poisoned themselves, like Chatterton, for want of it, or choked"
10652,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"themselves, like Otway, on obtaining it. Possibly, having learned to"
10653,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,think humbly of myself--there is nothing like early sickness and sorrow
10654,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,for “taking the conceit” out of one--my vanity did not presume to
10655,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"think, with certain juvenile Tracticians, that I “had a call” to hold"
10656,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"forth in print for the edification of mankind. Perchance, the very"
10657,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,deep reverence my reading had led me to entertain for our Bards and
10658,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Sages, deterred me from thrusting myself into the fellowship of Beings"
10659,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"that seemed only a little lower than the angels. However, in spite of"
10660,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"that very common excuse for publication, “the advice of a friend,”"
10661,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,who seriously recommended the submitting of my MSS. to a literary
10662,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"authority, with a view to his imprimatur, my slight acquaintance with"
10663,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the press was pushed no farther. On the contrary, I had selected a"
10664,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"branch of the Fine Arts for my serious pursuit. Prudence, the daughter"
10665,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of Wisdom, whispering perhaps, that the engraver, Pye, had a better"
10666,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"chance of a beefsteak inside, than Pye the Laureate; not that the"
10667,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"verse-spinning was quite given up. Though working in _aqua fortis_,"
10668,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"I still played with Castaly, now writing--all monkeys are imitators,"
10669,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and all young authors are monkeys--now writing a Bandit, to match"
10670,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the Corsair, and anon, hatching a Lalla Crow, by way of companion"
10671,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"to Lalla Rookh. Moreover, about this time, I became a member of a"
10672,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,private select Literary Society (alluded to at page 97 of the present
10673,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,work) that “waited on Ladies and Gentlemen at their own houses.” Our
10674,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Minerva, allegorically speaking, was a motley personage, in blue"
10675,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"stockings, a flounced gown, Quaker cap, and kerchief, French flowers,"
10676,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and a man’s hat. She held a fan in one hand, and a blowpipe in the"
10677,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"other. Her votaries were of both sexes, old and young, married and"
10678,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"single, assenters, dissenters, High Church, Low Church, No Church;"
10679,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Doctors in Physics, and Apothecaries in Metaphysics; dabblers in"
10680,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Logic, Chemistry, Casuistry, Sophistry, Natural and unnatural History,"
10681,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Phrenology, Geology, Conchology, Demonology; in short, all kinds of"
10682,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Colledgy-Knowledgy-Ology, including “Cakeology,” and tea and coffee."
10683,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Like other Societies, we had our President--a sort of Speaker who"
10684,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,never spoke; at least within my experience he never unbosomed himself
10685,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,of anything but a portentous shirt frill. According to the usual order
10686,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of the entertainment, there was--first, Tea and Small Talk; secondly,"
10687,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"an original Essay, which should have been followed, thirdly, by a"
10688,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Discussion, or Great Talk; but nine times in ten, it chanced, or"
10689,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"rather mumchanced, that, between those who did not know what to think,"
10690,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and others, who did not know how to deliver what they thought, there"
10691,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"ensued a dead silence, so “very dead indeed,” as Apollo Belvi says,"
10692,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,that it seemed buried into the bargain. To make this awkward pause
10693,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"more awkward, some misgiving voice, between a whisper and a croak,"
10694,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"would stammer out some allusion to a Quaker’s Meeting, answered from"
10695,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"right to left by a running titter, the speaker having innocently, or"
10696,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"perhaps wilfully forgotten, that one or two friends in drab coats, and"
10697,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"as many in slate-coloured gowns, were sitting, thumb-twiddling, in the"
10698,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,circle. Not that the Friends contented themselves with playing _dumby_
10699,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"at our discussions. They often spoke, and very characteristically,"
10700,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"to the matter in hand. For instance, their favourite doctrine of"
10701,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,non-resistance was once pushed--if Quakers ever push--a little “beyond
10702,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"beyond.” By way of clencher, one fair, meek, sleek Quakeress, in dove"
10703,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"colour, gravely told a melodramatical story of a conscientious Friend,"
10704,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"who rather than lift even his little finger against a Foe, passively,"
10705,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"yea, lamblike, suffered himself to be butchered in bed by an assassin,"
10706,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and died consistently, as he thought, with Fox principles, very like a"
10707,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Goose. As regards my own share in the Essays and Arguments, it misgives"
10708,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"me that they no more satisfied our decidedly serious members, than"
10709,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"they now propitiate Mr. Rae Wilson. At least, one Society night, in"
10710,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"escorting a female Fellow towards her home, she suddenly stopped me,"
10711,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"taking advantage perhaps of the awful locality, and its associations,"
10712,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"just in front of our chief criminal prison, and looking earnestly in my"
10713,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"face, by the light of a Newgate lamp, inquired somewhat abruptly, “Mr."
10714,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Hood! are you not an Infidel[5]?”
10715,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10716,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"In the mean time, whilst thus playing at Literature, an event was"
10717,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"ripening which was to introduce me to Authorship in earnest, and make"
10718,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the Muse, with whom I had only flirted, my companion for life. It"
10719,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"had often occurred to me that a striking, romantical, necromantical,"
10720,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"metaphysical, melodramatical, Germanish story, might be composed, the"
10721,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,interest of which should turn on the mysterious influence of the fate
10722,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of A over the destiny of B, the said parties having no more natural"
10723,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,or apparent connexion with each other than Tenterden Steeple and the
10724,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Goodwin Sands. An instance of this occult contingency occurred in my
10725,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,own case; for I did not even know by sight the unfortunate gentleman
10726,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,on whose untimely exit depended my entrance on the literary stage.
10727,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"In the beginning of the year 1821, a memorable duel, originating in"
10728,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"a pen-and-ink quarrel, took place at Chalk Farm, and terminated in"
10729,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the death of Mr. John Scott, the able Editor of the London Magazine."
10730,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"The melancholy result excited great interest, in which I fully"
10731,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"participated, little dreaming that his catastrophe involved any"
10732,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"consequences of importance to myself. But on the loss of its conductor,"
10733,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,the Periodical passed into other hands. The new Proprietors were my
10734,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"friends; they sent for me, and after some preliminaries, I was duly"
10735,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,installed as a sort of sub-Editor of the London Magazine.
10736,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10737,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"It would be affectation to say, that engraving was resigned with"
10738,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,regret. There is always something mechanical about the art--moreover
10739,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"it is as unwholesome as wearisome to sit copper-fastened to a board,"
10740,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"with a cantle scooped out to accommodate your stomach, if you have one,"
10741,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"painfully ruling, ruling, and still ruling lines straight or crooked,"
10742,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"by the long hundred to the square inch, at the doubly hazardous risk"
10743,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"which Wordsworth so deprecates, of “growing double.” So farewell"
10744,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Woollett! Strange! Bartolozzi! I have said, my vanity did not rashly"
10745,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,plunge me into authorship; but no sooner was there a legitimate opening
10746,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"than I jumped at it, à la Grimaldi, head foremost, and was speedily"
10747,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,behind the scenes.
10748,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10749,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"To judge by my zeal and delight in my new pursuit, the bowl had at"
10750,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"last found its natural bias[6]. Not content with taking articles,"
10751,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,like candidates for holy orders--with rejecting articles like the
10752,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Belgians--I dreamt articles, thought articles, wrote articles, which"
10753,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"were all inserted by the editor, of course, with the concurrence of his"
10754,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"deputy. The more irksome parts of authorship, such as the correction"
10755,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of the press, were to me labours of love. I received a revise from Mr."
10756,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Baldwin’s Mr. Parker, as if it had been a proof of his regard; forgave"
10757,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"him all his slips, and really thought that printers’ devils were not"
10758,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,so black as they are painted. But my top-gallant glory was in “our
10759,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Contributors!” How I used to look forward to Elia! and backward for
10760,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Hazlitt, and all round for Edward Herbert, and how I used to _look"
10761,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,up_ to Allan Cunningham! for at that time the London had a goodly
10762,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"list of writers--a rare company. It is now defunct, and perhaps no"
10763,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,ex-periodical might so appropriately be apostrophized with the Irish
10764,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"funereal question--“Arrah, honey, why did you die?” Had you not an"
10765,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"editor, and elegant prose writers, and beautiful poets, and broths"
10766,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of boys for criticism and classics, and wits and humorists.--Elia,"
10767,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Cary, Procter, Cunningham, Bowring, Barton, Hazlitt, Elton, Hartley"
10768,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Coleridge, Talfourd, Soane, Horace Smith, Reynolds, Poole, Clare, and"
10769,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Thomas Benyon, with a power besides. Hadn’t you Lions’ Heads with"
10770,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Traditional Tales? Hadn’t you an Opium Eater, and a Dwarf, and a Giant,"
10771,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and a Learned Lamb, and a Green Man? Had not you a regular Drama, and"
10772,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"a Musical Report, and a Report of Agriculture, and an Obituary, and"
10773,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"a Price Current, and a current price, of only half-a-crown? Arrah,"
10774,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"why did you die? Why, somehow the contributors fell away--the concern"
10775,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"went into other hands--worst of all, a new editor tried to put the"
10776,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Belles Lettres in Utilitarian envelopes; whereupon, the circulation"
10777,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of the Miscellany, like that of poor Le Fevre, got slower, slower,"
10778,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"slower,--and slower still--and then stopped for ever! It was a sorry"
10779,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,scattering of those old Londoners! Some went out of the country: one
10780,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,(Clare) went into it. Lamb retreated to Colebrooke. Mr. Cary presented
10781,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,himself to the British Museum. Reynolds and Barry took to engrossing
10782,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"when they should pen a stanza, and Thomas Benyon gave up literature."
10783,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10784,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"It is with mingled feelings of pride, pleasure, and pain, that I revert"
10785,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"to those old times, when the writers I had long known and admired"
10786,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,in spirit were present to me in the flesh--when I had the delight
10787,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of listening to their wit and wisdom from their own lips, of gazing"
10788,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"on their faces, and grasping their right hands. Familiar figures"
10789,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"rise before me, familiar voices ring in my ears, and alas! amongst"
10790,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"them are shapes that I must never see, sounds that I can never hear,"
10791,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"again. Before my departure from England, I was one of the few who"
10792,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,saw the grave close over the remains of one whom to know as a friend
10793,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,was to love as a relation. Never did a better soul go to a better
10794,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,world! Never perhaps (giving the lie direct to the common imputation
10795,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of envy, malice, and hatred, amongst the brotherhood), never did"
10796,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,an author descend--to quote his favourite Sir T. Browne--into “the
10797,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"land of the mole and the pismire” so hung with golden opinions, and"
10798,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"honoured and regretted with such sincere eulogies and elegies, by his"
10799,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"contemporaries. To HIM, the first of these, my reminiscences,"
10800,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"is eminently due, for I lost in him not only a dear and kind friend,"
10801,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"but an invaluable critic; one whom, were such literary adoptions in"
10802,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"modern use, I might well name, as Cotton called Walton, my “father.” To"
10803,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"borrow the earnest language of old Jean Bertaut, as Englished by Mr."
10804,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Cary--
10805,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10806,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"“Thou, chiefly, noble spirit, for whose loss"
10807,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Just grief and mourning all our hearts engross,"
10808,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Who seeing me devoted to the Nine,"
10809,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Didst hope some fruitage from those buds of mine;
10810,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Thou didst excite me after thee t’ascend
10811,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,The Muses’ sacred hill; nor only lend
10812,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Example, but inspirit me to reach"
10813,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,The far-off summit by thy friendly speech.

10820,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,_That I have seen thy visage--touch’d thy hand_!”

10822,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"I was sitting one morning beside our Editor, busily correcting"
10823,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"proofs, when a visitor was announced, whose name, grumbled by a low"
10824,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"ventriloquial voice, like Tom Pipes calling from the hold through the"
10825,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"hatchway, did not resound distinctly on my tympanum. However, the door"
10826,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"opened, and in came a stranger,--a figure remarkable at a glance, with"
10827,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"a fine head, on a small spare body, supported by two almost immaterial"
10828,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"legs. He was clothed in sables, of a bygone fashion, but there was"
10829,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"something wanting, or something present about him, that certified he"
10830,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"was neither a divine, nor a physician, nor a schoolmaster: from a"
10831,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"certain neatness and sobriety in his dress, coupled with his sedate"
10832,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"bearing, he might have been taken, but that such a costume would be"
10833,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"anomalous, for a _Quaker_ in black. He looked still more like (what"
10834,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"he really was) a literary Modern Antique, a New-Old Author, a living"
10835,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Anachronism, contemporary at once with Burton the Elder, and Colman"
10836,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the Younger. Meanwhile he advanced with rather a peculiar gait, his"
10837,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"walk was plantigrade, and with a cheerful “How d’ye,” and one of the"
10838,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"blandest, sweetest smiles that ever brightened a manly countenance,"
10839,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,held out two fingers to the Editor. The two gentlemen in black soon
10840,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"fell into discourse; and whilst they conferred, the Lavater principle"
10841,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"within me, set to work upon the interesting specimen thus presented to"
10842,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"its speculations. It was a striking intellectual face, full of wiry"
10843,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"lines, physiognomical quips and cranks, that gave it great character."
10844,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"There was much earnestness about the brows, and a deal of speculation"
10845,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"in the eyes, which were brown and bright, and “quick in turning;” the"
10846,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"nose, a decided one, though of no established order; and there was"
10847,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,a handsome smartness about the mouth. Altogether it was no common
10848,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"face--none of those _willow-pattern_ ones, which Nature turns out by"
10849,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,thousands at her potteries;--but more like a chance specimen of the
10850,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Chinese ware, one to the set--unique, antique, quaint. No one who had"
10851,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"once seen it, could pretend not to know it again. It was no face to"
10852,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,lend its countenance to any confusion of persons in a Comedy of Errors.
10853,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"You might have sworn to it piecemeal,--a separate affidavit for every"
10854,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,feature. In short his face was as original as his figure; his figure
10855,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,as his character; his character as his writings; his writings the most
10856,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"original of the age. After the literary business had been settled,"
10857,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the Editor invited his contributor to dinner, adding “we shall have a"
10858,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,hare--”
10859,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10860,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,“And--and--and--and many Friends!”
10861,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10862,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"The hesitation in the speech, and the readiness of the illusion,"
10863,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"were alike characteristic of the individual, whom his familiars will"
10864,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"perchance have recognised already as the delightful Essayist, the"
10865,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"capital Critic, the pleasant Wit and Humorist, the delicate-minded and"
10866,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"large-hearted Charles Lamb! He was shy like myself with strangers,"
10867,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"so that, despite my yearnings, our first meeting scarcely amounted"
10868,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"to an introduction. We were both at dinner, amongst the hare’s many"
10869,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"friends, but our acquaintance got no farther, in spite of a desperate"
10870,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,attempt on my part to attract his notice. His complaint of the Decay
10871,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of Beggars presented another chance: I wrote on coarse paper, and"
10872,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"in ragged English, a letter of thanks to him as if from one of his"
10873,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"mendicant clients, but it produced no effect. I had given up all hope,"
10874,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"when one night, sitting sick and sad, in my bed-room, racked with the"
10875,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"rheumatism, the door was suddenly opened, the well-known quaint figure"
10876,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"in black walked in without any formality, and with a cheerful “Well,"
10877,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"boy, how are you?” and the bland sweet smile, extended the two fingers."
10878,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"They were eagerly clutched of course, and from that hour we were firm"
10879,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,friends.
10880,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10881,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Thus characteristically commenced my intimacy with C. Lamb. He had
10882,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"recently become my neighbour, and in a few days called again, to"
10883,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"ask me to tea, “to meet Wordsworth.” In spite of any idle jests to"
10884,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the contrary, the name had a spell in it that drew me to Colebrooke"
10885,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Cottage[7] with more alacrity[8] than consisted with prudence, stiff"
10886,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"joints and a North wind. But I was willing to run, at least hobble,"
10887,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"some risk, to be of a party in a parlour with the Author of Laodamia"
10888,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and Hartleap Well. As for his Betty Foy-bles, he is not the first"
10889,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"man by many, who has met with a _simple_ fracture through riding his"
10890,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"theory-hack so far and so fast, that it broke down with him. If he has"
10891,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"now and then put on a nightcap, so have his own next-door mountains."
10892,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"If he has babbled, sometimes, like an infant of _two_ years old, he"
10893,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"has also thought, and felt, and spoken, the beautiful fancies and"
10894,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"tender affections, and artless language, of the children who can say"
10895,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"“We are _seven_.” Along with food for babes, he has furnished strong"
10896,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,meat for men. So I put on my great coat and in a few minutes found
10897,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"myself, for the first time at a door, that opened to me as frankly as"
10898,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"its master’s heart; for, without any preliminaries of hall, passage,"
10899,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"or parlour, one single step across the threshold brought me into the"
10900,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"sitting-room, and in sight of the domestic hearth. The room looked"
10901,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"brown with “old bokes,” and beside the fire sate Wordsworth, and his"
10902,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"sister, the hospitable Elia, and the excellent Bridget. As for the bard"
10903,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of Rydal, his outward man did not, perhaps, disappoint one; but the"
10904,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"_palaver_, as the Indians say, fell short of my anticipations. Perhaps"
10905,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"my memory is in fault; ’twas many years ago, and, unlike the biographer"
10906,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of Johnson, I have never made Bozziness my business. However, excepting"
10907,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,a discussion on the value of the promissory notes issued by our younger
10908,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"poets, wherein Wordsworth named Shelley, and Lamb took John Keats for"
10909,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"choice, there was nothing of literary interest brought upon the carpet."
10910,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"But a book man cannot always be bookish. A poet, even a Rydal one,"
10911,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"must be glad at times to descend from Saddleback, and feel his legs."
10912,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"He cannot, like the Girl in the Fairy Tale, be always talking diamonds"
10913,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,and pearls. It is a “Vulgar Errour” to suppose that an author must
10914,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"be always authoring, even with his feet on the fender. Nevertheless,"
10915,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"it is not an uncommon impression, that a writer sonnetises his wife,"
10916,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"sings odes to his children, talks essays and epigrams to his friends,"
10917,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,and reviews his servants. It was in something of this spirit that an
10918,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,official gentleman to whom I mentioned the pleasant literary meetings
10919,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"at Lamb’s, associated them instantly with his parochial mutual"
10920,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"instruction evening schools, and remarked, “Yes, yes, all very proper"
10921,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and praiseworthy--of course, you go there _to improve your minds_.”"
10922,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10923,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"And very pleasant and improving, though not of set purpose, to both"
10924,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"mind and heart, were those extempore assemblies at Colebrooke Cottage."
10925,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,It was wholesome for the soul but to breathe its atmosphere. It was
10926,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,a House of Call for All Denominations. _Sides_ were lost in that
10927,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"_circle_, Men of all parties postponed their partisanship, and met"
10928,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"as on a neutral ground. There were but two persons, whom L. avowedly"
10929,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"did not wish to encounter beneath his roof, and those two, merely on"
10930,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"account of private and family differences. For the rest, they left all"
10931,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"their hostilities at the door, with their sticks. This forbearance was"
10932,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"due to the truly tolerant spirit of the Host, which influenced all"
10933,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"within its sphere. Lamb, whilst he willingly lent a crutch to halting"
10934,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Humility, took delight in tripping up the stilts of Pretension. Anybody"
10935,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,might trot out his Hobby; but he allowed nobody to ride the High Horse.
10936,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"If it was a High German, one like those ridden by the Devil and Doctor"
10937,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Faustus, he would chaunt"
10938,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10939,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,“Gëuty Gëuty
10940,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Is a great Beauty,”"
10941,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10942,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,till the rider moderated his gallop. He hated anything like
10943,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Cock-of-the-Walk-ism; and set his face and his wit against all
10944,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Ultraism, Transcendentalism, Sentimentalism, Conventional Mannerism,"
10945,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and above all, Separatism. In opposition to the Exclusives, he was"
10946,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,emphatically an Inclusive.
10947,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10948,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"As he once owned to me, he was fond of antagonising. Indeed in the"
10949,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"sketch of himself, prefacing the Last Essays of Elia--a sketch for its"
10950,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"truth to have delighted Mason the Self-Knowledge man--he says, “with"
10951,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the Religionist I pass for a Free-thinker, while the other faction set"
10952,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"me down for a Bigot.” In fact, no politician ever laboured more to"
10953,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"preserve the Balance of Power in Europe, than he did to correct any"
10954,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"temporary preponderances. He was always _trimming_ in the nautical,"
10955,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"not in the political, sense. Thus in his “magnanimous letter,” as"
10956,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Hazlitt called it, to High Church Southey, he professed himself a"
10957,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Unitarian[9]. With a Catholic he would probably have called himself
10958,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"a Jew; as amongst Quakers, by way of a set-off against their own"
10959,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"formality, he would indulge in a little extra levity. I well remember"
10960,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"his chuckling at having spirited on his correspondent Bernard Barton,"
10961,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"to commit some little enormities, such as addressing him as C. Lamb,"
10962,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,_Esquire_.
10963,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10964,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,My visits at Lamb’s were shortly interrupted by a sojourn to
10965,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,unrheumatize myself at Hastings; but in default of other intercourse
10966,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"I received a letter in a well-known hand, quaint as the sentences it"
10967,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,conveyed.
10968,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10969,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,“And what dost thou at the Priory? Cucullus non facit Monachum.
10970,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"English me that, and challenge old Lignum Janua to make a better."
10971,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
10972,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,“My old New River has presented no extraordinary novelties lately.

10984,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Inquire out and see my little Protestant Loretto. It stands apart
10985,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"from trace of human habitation, yet hath it pulpit, reading-desk,"
10986,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and trim front of massiest marble, as if Robinson Crusoe had"
10987,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,reared it to soothe himself with old church-going images. I forget

10998,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,is gone by when I could have scribbled as long (I will not say as
10999,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,agreeable) as thine was to both of us. I am dwindled to notes and
11000,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,letterets. But in good earnest I shall be most happy to hail thy
11001,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,return to the waters of old Sir Hugh. There is nothing like inland

11012,“C. L.”,
11013,“C. L.”,The letter came to hand too late for me to hunt the “Lions;” but on
11014,“C. L.”,"a subsequent visit to the same Cinque Port with my wife, though we"
11015,“C. L.”,"verified the little Loretto, we could not find the Baker, or even his"
11016,“C. L.”,"man, howbeit we tried at every shop that had the least sign of bakery"
11017,“C. L.”,or cakery in its window. The whole was a batch of _fancy_ bread; one of
11018,“C. L.”,those fictions which the writer was apt to pass off upon his friends.
11019,“C. L.”,
11020,“C. L.”,"The evening meetings at Colebrooke Cottage--where somebody, who _was_"
11021,“C. L.”,"somebody, or a literary friend, was sure to drop in--were the more"
11022,“C. L.”,"grateful to me, as the London Magazine was now in a rapid decline;"
11023,“C. L.”,"some of its crack contributors had left it off, and the gatherings of"
11024,“C. L.”,"the clan to eat, drink, and be merry, were few and far between. There"
11025,“C. L.”,"was indeed one Venison Feast whereat, I have heard, the scent lay more"
11026,“C. L.”,"than breast high, and the sport was of as rich a quality; but it was my"
11027,“C. L.”,"chance to be absent from the pack. At former dinners, however, I had"
11028,“C. L.”,"been a guest, and a sketch of one of them may serve to introduce some"
11029,“C. L.”,of the principal characters of our “London in the Olden Time.”
11030,“C. L.”,
11031,“C. L.”,"On the right hand then of the Editor sits Elia, of the pleasant smile,"
11032,“C. L.”,and the quick eyes--Procter said of them that “they looked as if they
11033,“C. L.”,"could pick up pins and needles”--and a wit as quick as his eyes, and"
11034,“C. L.”,"sure, as Hazlitt described, to stammer out the best pun and the best"
11035,“C. L.”,"remark in the course of the evening. Next to him, shining verdantly out"
11036,“C. L.”,"from the grave-coloured suits of the literati, like a patch of turnips"
11037,“C. L.”,"amidst stubble and fallow, behold our Jack i’ the Green--John Clare!"
11038,“C. L.”,"In his bright, grass-coloured coat, and yellow waistcoat (there are"
11039,“C. L.”,"greenish stalks too, under the table), he looks a very Cowslip, and"
11040,“C. L.”,blooms amongst us as Goldsmith must have done in his peach-blossom.
11041,“C. L.”,"No wonder the door-keeper of the Soho Bazaar, seeing that _very"
11042,“C. L.”,"countrified_ suit, linked arm-in-arm with the Editorial sables, made a"
11043,“C. L.”,"boggle at admitting them into his repository, having seen, perchance,"
11044,“C. L.”,such a made-up Peasant “playing at playing” at thimble-rig about the
11045,“C. L.”,"Square. No wonder the gentleman’s gentleman, in the drab-coat and"
11046,“C. L.”,"sealing-wax smalls, at W---- ’s, was for cutting off our Green Man,"
11047,“C. L.”,"who was modestly the last in ascending the stairs as an interloper,"
11048,“C. L.”,though he made amends afterwards by waiting almost exclusively on the
11049,“C. L.”,"Peasant, perfectly convinced that he was some eccentric Notable of the"
11050,“C. L.”,"Corinthian order, disguised in Rustic. Little wonder either, that in"
11051,“C. L.”,"wending homewards on the same occasion through the Strand, the Peasant"
11052,“C. L.”,"and Elia, _Sylvanus et Urban_, linked comfortably together; there arose"
11053,“C. L.”,the frequent cry of “Look at Tom and Jerry--there goes Tom and Jerry!”
11054,“C. L.”,"for truly, Clare in his square-cut green coat, and Lamb in his black,"
11055,“C. L.”,"were not a little suggestive of Hawthorn and Logic, in the plates to"
11056,“C. L.”,“Life in London.”
11057,“C. L.”,
11058,“C. L.”,But to return to the table. Elia--much more of House Lamb than of
11059,“C. L.”,"Grass Lamb--avowedly caring little or nothing for Pastoral; cottons,"
11060,“C. L.”,"nevertheless, very kindly to the Northamptonshire Poet, and still"
11061,“C. L.”,"more to his ale, pledging him again and again as “Clarissimus,”"
11062,“C. L.”,"and “Princely Clare,” and sometimes so lustily, as to make the"
11063,“C. L.”,latter cast an anxious glance into his tankard. By his bright happy
11064,“C. L.”,"look, the Helpstone Visitor is inwardly contrasting the unlettered"
11065,“C. L.”,"country company of Clod, and Hodge and Podge, with the delights of"
11066,“C. L.”,"“London” society Elia, and Barry, and Herbert, and Mr. Table Talk,"
11067,“C. L.”,_cum multis_--_aliis_--i.e. a multiplicity of all. But besides the
11068,“C. L.”,"tankard, the two “drouthie neebors” discuss Poetry in general[10], and"
11069,“C. L.”,"Montgomery’s “Common Lot” in particular, Lamb insisting on the beauty"
11070,“C. L.”,"of the tangental sharp turn at “O! she was fair!” thinking, mayhap, of"
11071,“C. L.”,"his own Alice W----, and Clare swearing “Dal” (a clarified d--n) “Dal!"
11072,“C. L.”,"if it isn’t like a Dead Man preaching out of his coffin!” Anon, the"
11073,“C. L.”,Humorist begins to banter the Peasant on certain “Clare-obscurities” in
11074,“C. L.”,"his own verses, originating in a contempt for the rules of Priscian,"
11075,“C. L.”,"whereupon the accused, thinking with Burns,"
11076,“C. L.”,
11077,“C. L.”,“What ser’es their grammars?

11080,“C. L.”,
11081,“C. L.”,vehemently denounces all Philology as nothing but a sort of man-trap
11082,“C. L.”,"for authors, and heartily dals Lindley Murray for “inventing it!”"
11083,“C. L.”,
11084,“C. L.”,"It must have been at such a time, that Hilton _conceived_ his clever"
11085,“C. L.”,"portrait of C----, when he was “C in alt.” He was hardy, rough, and"
11086,“C. L.”,clumsy enough to look truly rustic--like an Ingram’s rustic chair.
11087,“C. L.”,"There was a slightness about his frame, with a delicacy of features"
11088,“C. L.”,"and complexion, that associated him more with the Garden than with the"
11089,“C. L.”,"Field, and made him look the Peasant of a Ferme Ornée. In this respect"
11090,“C. L.”,"he was as much beneath the genuine stalwart bronzed Plough-Poet,"
11091,“C. L.”,"Burns, as above the Farmer’s Boy, whom I remember to have seen in my"
11092,“C. L.”,"childhood, when he lived in a miniature house, near the Shepherd and"
11093,“C. L.”,"Shepherdess, now the Eagle tavern, in the City Road, and manufactured"
11094,“C. L.”,"Æolian harps, and kept ducks. The Suffolk Giles had very little of"
11095,“C. L.”,the agricultural in his appearance; he looked infinitely more like a
11096,“C. L.”,"handicraftsman, _town-made_."
11097,“C. L.”,
11098,“C. L.”,Poor Clare!--It would greatly please me to hear that he was happy and
11099,“C. L.”,"well, and thriving; but the transplanting of Peasants and Farmers’ Boys"
11100,“C. L.”,"from the natural into an artificial soil, does not always conduce to"
11101,“C. L.”,"their happiness, or health, or ultimate well doing. I trust the true"
11102,“C. L.”,"Friends, who, with a natural hankering after poetry, because it is"
11103,“C. L.”,"forbidden them, have ventured to pluck and eat of the pastoral sorts,"
11104,“C. L.”,"as most dallying with the innocence of nature,--and who on that account"
11105,“C. L.”,patronised Capel Lofft’s protégé--I do trust and hope they took off
11106,“C. L.”,whole editions of the Northamptonshire Bard. There was much about Clare
11107,“C. L.”,"for a Quaker to like; he was tender-hearted, and averse to violence."
11108,“C. L.”,"How he recoiled once, bodily-taking his chair along with him,--from a"
11109,“C. L.”,"young surgeon, or surgeon’s friend, who let drop, somewhat abruptly,"
11110,“C. L.”,"that he was just come “from seeing a child skinned!”--Clare, from his"
11111,“C. L.”,"look of horror, evidently thought that the poor infant, like Marsyas,"
11112,“C. L.”,had been flayed _alive_! He was both gentle and simple. I have heard
11113,“C. L.”,"that on his first visit to London, his publishers considerately sent"
11114,“C. L.”,their porter to meet him at the inn; but when Thomas necessarily
11115,“C. L.”,"inquired of the gentleman in green, “Are you Mr. Clare?” the latter,"
11116,“C. L.”,"willing to foil the traditionary tricks of London sharpers, replied to"
11117,“C. L.”,the suspicious query with “a positive negative.”[11]
11118,“C. L.”,
11119,“C. L.”,"The Brobdignagian next to Clare, overtopping him by the whole head and"
11120,“C. L.”,"shoulders--a physical “Colossus of Literature,” the grenadier of our"
11121,“C. L.”,"corps--is Allan, not Allan Ramsay, “no, nor Barbara Allan neither,”"
11122,“C. L.”,"but Allan Cunningham,--“a credit,” quoth Sir Walter Scott (he might"
11123,“C. L.”,have said a long credit) “to Caledonia.” He is often called “honest
11124,“C. L.”,"Allan,” to distinguish him, perhaps, from one Allan-a-Dale, who was"
11125,“C. L.”,"apt to mistake his neighbours’ goods for his own--sometimes, between"
11126,“C. L.”,"ourselves, yelept the “C. of Solway,” in allusion to that favourite"
11127,“C. L.”,"“Allan Water,” the Solway Sea. There is something of the true moody"
11128,“C. L.”,"poetical weather observable in the barometer of his face, alternating"
11129,“C. L.”,"from Variable to Showery, from Stormy to Set Fair. At times he looks"
11130,“C. L.”,gloomy and earnest and traditional--a little like a Covenanter--but he
11131,“C. L.”,suddenly clears up and laughs a hearty laugh that lifts him an inch or
11132,“C. L.”,"two from his chair, for he rises at a joke when he sees one, like a"
11133,“C. L.”,"trout at a fly, and finishes with a smart rubbing of his ample palms."
11134,“C. L.”,"He has store, too, of broad Scotch stories, and shrewd sayings; and"
11135,“C. L.”,"he writes--no, he wrote rare old-new or new-old ballads. Why not now?"
11136,“C. L.”,"Has his Pegasus, as he once related of his pony, run from under him?"
11137,“C. L.”,Has the Mermaid of Galloway left no little ones? Is Bonnie Lady Ann
11138,“C. L.”,"married, or May Morison dead? Thou vast formed for a poet, Allan, by"
11139,“C. L.”,"nature, and by stature too, according to Pope--"
11140,“C. L.”,
11141,“C. L.”,“To snatch a grace _beyond the reach_ of Art.”
11142,“C. L.”,
11143,“C. L.”,"And are there not Longman, or Tallboys, for thy Publishers? But alas!"
11144,“C. L.”,"we are fallen on evil days for Bards and Barding, and nine tailors"
11145,“C. L.”,do more for a man than the Nine Muses. The only Lay likely to answer
11146,“C. L.”,now-a-days would be an Ode (with the proper testimonials) to the
11147,“C. L.”,Literary Fund!
11148,“C. L.”,
11149,“C. L.”,"The Reverend personage on the Editor’s right, with the studious brow,"
11150,“C. L.”,"deep-set eyes, and bald crown, is the mild and modest Cary--the same"
11151,“C. L.”,who turned Dante into Miltonic English blank verse. He is sending
11152,“C. L.”,"his plate towards the partridges, which he will relish and digest as"
11153,“C. L.”,"though they were the Birds of Aristophanes. He has his eye, too, on"
11154,“C. L.”,"the French made-dishes[12]. Pity, shame and pity, such a Translator"
11155,“C. L.”,"found no better translation in the Church! Is it possible that, in some"
11156,“C. L.”,"no-popery panic, it was thought by merely being Dragoman to Purgatory"
11157,“C. L.”,he had _Romed_ from the true faith?
11158,“C. L.”,
11159,“C. L.”,"A very pleasant day we “Londoners” once spent at a Chiswick parsonage,"
11160,“C. L.”,"formerly tenanted by Hogarth, along with the hospitable Cary, and, as"
11161,“C. L.”,"Elia called them, his Caryatides![13] The last time my eyes rested on"
11162,“C. L.”,"the Interpreter (of the House Beautiful as well as of the Inferno), he"
11163,“C. L.”,"was on the Library steps of the British Museum. Ere this, I trust he"
11164,“C. L.”,"hath reached the tiptop--nay, hath perhaps attained, being a Literary"
11165,“C. L.”,"Worthy, even unto a Trusteeship, and had to buy, at Ellis’s, a few"
11166,“C. L.”,yards of the Blue Ribbon of Literature!
11167,“C. L.”,
11168,“C. L.”,"Procter,--alias Barry Cornwall, formerly of the Marcian Colonnade, now"
11169,“C. L.”,"of some prosaical Inn of Court--the kindly Procter, one of the foremost"
11170,“C. L.”,"to welcome me into the Brotherhood, with a too-flattering Dedication"
11171,“C. L.”,"(another instance against the jealousy of authors), is my own left-hand"
11172,“C. L.”,file. But what he says shall be kept as strictly confidential; for he
11173,“C. L.”,"is whispering it into my Martineau ear. On my other side, when I turn"
11174,“C. L.”,"that way, I see a profile, a shadow of which ever confronts me on"
11175,“C. L.”,"opening my writing-desk,--a sketch taken from memory, the day after"
11176,“C. L.”,seeing the original[14]. In opposition to the “extra man’s size” of
11177,“C. L.”,"Cunningham, the party in question looks almost boyish, partly from"
11178,“C. L.”,"being in bulk somewhat beneath Monsieur Quetelet’s “Average Man,” but"
11179,“C. L.”,still more so from a peculiar delicacy of complexion and smallness of
11180,“C. L.”,"features, which look all the smaller from his wearing, in compliment,"
11181,“C. L.”,"probably, to the _Samsons_ of Teutonic Literature, his locks unshorn."
11182,“C. L.”,"Nevertheless whoever looks again,"
11183,“C. L.”,
11184,“C. L.”,Sees more than marks the crowd of common men.
11185,“C. L.”,
11186,“C. L.”,"There is speculation in the eyes, a curl of the lip, and a general"
11187,“C. L.”,"character in the outline, that reminds one of some portraits of"
11188,“C. L.”,"Voltaire. And a Philosopher he is every inch. He looks, thinks,"
11189,“C. L.”,"writes, talks and walks, eats and drinks, and no doubt sleeps"
11190,“C. L.”,philosophically--_i.e._ deliberately. There is nothing abrupt
11191,“C. L.”,"about his motions,--he goes and comes calmly and quietly--like the"
11192,“C. L.”,"phantom in Hamlet, he is here--he is there--he is gone! So it is"
11193,“C. L.”,"with his discourse. He speaks slowly, clearly, and with very marked"
11194,“C. L.”,"emphasis--the tide of talk flows like Denham’s river, “strong without"
11195,“C. L.”,"rage, without overflowing, full.” When it was my frequent and agreeable"
11196,“C. L.”,"duty to call on Mr. De Quincey (being an uncommon name to remember,"
11197,“C. L.”,"the servant associated it, on the Memoria Technica principle, with a"
11198,“C. L.”,"sore throat and always pronounced it Quinsy), and I have found him at"
11199,“C. L.”,"home, quite at home, in the midst of a German Ocean of _Literature_, in"
11200,“C. L.”,"a storm,--flooding all the floor, the table and the chairs,--billows"
11201,“C. L.”,"of books tossing, tumbling, surging open,--on such occasions I have"
11202,“C. L.”,"willingly listened by the hour whilst the Philosopher, standing, with"
11203,“C. L.”,"his eyes fixed on one side of the room, seemed to be less speaking"
11204,“C. L.”,than reading from a “handwriting on the wall.” Now and then he would
11205,“C. L.”,"diverge, for a Scotch mile or two, to the right or left, till I was"
11206,“C. L.”,"tempted to inquire with Peregrine in John Bull (Colman’s not Hook’s),"
11207,“C. L.”,“Do you never deviate?”--but he always came safely back to the point
11208,“C. L.”,"where he had left, not lost the scent, and thence hunted his topic to"
11209,“C. L.”,"the end. But look!--we are in the small hours, and a change comes o’er"
11210,“C. L.”,the spirit of that “old familiar face.” A faint hectic tint leaves
11211,“C. L.”,"the cheek, the eyes are a degree dimmer, and each is surrounded by"
11212,“C. L.”,a growing shadow--signs of the waning influence of that Potent Drug
11213,“C. L.”,whose stupendous Pleasures and enormous Pains have been so eloquently
11214,“C. L.”,"described by the English Opium Eater. Marry, I have one of his"
11215,“C. L.”,Confessions with his own name and mark to it:--an apology for a certain
11216,“C. L.”,"stain on his MS., the said stain being a large purplish ring,--“Within"
11217,“C. L.”,"that circle none durst drink but he,”--in fact the impression,"
11218,“C. L.”,"coloured, of “a tumbler of laudanum negus, warm, without sugar.”[15]"
11219,“C. L.”,
11220,“C. L.”,"That smart active person opposite with a game-cock-looking head, and"
11221,“C. L.”,"the hair combed smooth, fighter fashion, over his forehead--with"
11222,“C. L.”,"one finger hooked round a glass of champagne, not that he requires"
11223,“C. L.”,"it to inspirit him, for his wit bubbles up of itself--is our Edward"
11224,“C. L.”,"Herbert, the Author of that true piece of Biography, the Life of Peter"
11225,“C. L.”,"Corcoran. He is “good with both hands,” like that Nonpareil Randall,"
11226,“C. L.”,at a comic verse or a serious stanza--smart at a repartee--sharp at a
11227,“C. L.”,"retort, and not averse to a bit of mischief. ’Twas he who gave the"
11228,“C. L.”,"runaway ring at Wordsworth’s Peter Bell. Generally, his jests, set"
11229,“C. L.”,"off by a happy manner, are only ticklesome, but now and then they are"
11230,“C. L.”,"sharp-flavoured,--like the sharpness of the pine-apple. Would I could"
11231,“C. L.”,give a sample. Alas! What a pity it is that so many good things uttered
11232,“C. L.”,"by Poets, and Wits, and Humorists, at chance times--and they are always"
11233,“C. L.”,"the best and brightest, like sparks struck out by Pegasus’ own hoof,"
11234,“C. L.”,in a curvet amongst the flints--should be daily and hourly lost to the
11235,“C. L.”,"world for want of a recorder! But in this Century of Inventions, when"
11236,“C. L.”,a self-acting drawing-paper has been discovered for copying visible
11237,“C. L.”,"objects, who knows but that a future Niepce, or Daguerre, or Herschel,"
11238,“C. L.”,"or Fox Talbot, may find out some sort of Boswellish writing-paper to"
11239,“C. L.”,repeat whatever it hears!
11240,“C. L.”,
11241,“C. L.”,There are other Contributors--poor Hazlitt for instance--whose shades
11242,“C. L.”,rise up before me: but I never met with them at the Entertainments just
11243,“C. L.”,described. Shall we ever meet anywhere again? Alas! some are dead; and
11244,“C. L.”,"the rest dispersed; and the days of _Social_ Clubs are over and gone,"
11245,“C. L.”,when the Professors and Patrons of Literature assembled round the same
11246,“C. L.”,"steaming bowl, and Johnson, always best out of print, exclaimed, “Lads!"
11247,“C. L.”,who’s for Poonch!”
11248,“C. L.”,
11249,“C. L.”,*       *       *       *       *
11250,“C. L.”,
11251,“C. L.”,"Amongst other notable men who came to Colebrooke Cottage, I had twice"
11252,“C. L.”,the good fortune of meeting with S. T. Coleridge. The first time
11253,“C. L.”,"he came from Highgate with Mrs. Gilman, to dine with “Charles and"
11254,“C. L.”,"Mary.” What a contrast to Lamb was the full-bodied Poet, with his"
11255,“C. L.”,"waving white hair, and his face round, ruddy, and unfurrowed as a"
11256,“C. L.”,holy Friar’s! Apropos to which face he gave us a humorous description
11257,“C. L.”,"of an unfinished portrait, that served him for a sort of barometer,"
11258,“C. L.”,to indicate the state of his popularity. So sure as his name made
11259,“C. L.”,"any temporary stir, out came the canvas on the easel, and a request"
11260,“C. L.”,from the artist for another sitting: down sank the Original in the
11261,“C. L.”,"public notice, and back went the copy into a corner, till some fresh"
11262,“C. L.”,publication or accident again brought forward the Poet; and then forth
11263,“C. L.”,came the picture for a few more touches. I sincerely hope it has been
11264,“C. L.”,"finished! What a benign, smiling face it was! What a comfortable,"
11265,“C. L.”,"respectable figure! What a model, methought, as I watched and admired"
11266,“C. L.”,"the “Old Man eloquent,” for a Christian bishop! But he was, perhaps,"
11267,“C. L.”,"scarcely orthodox enough to be trusted with a mitre. At least, some of"
11268,“C. L.”,his voluntaries would have frightened a common everyday congregation
11269,“C. L.”,"from their propriety. Amongst other matters of discourse, he came to"
11270,“C. L.”,speak of the strange notions some literal-minded persons form of the
11271,“C. L.”,"joys of Heaven; joys they associated with mere temporal things, in"
11272,“C. L.”,"which, for his own part, finding no delight in this world, he could"
11273,“C. L.”,"find no bliss hereafter, without a change in his nature, tantamount to"
11274,“C. L.”,"the loss of his personal identity. For instance, he said, there are"
11275,“C. L.”,persons who place the whole angelical beatitude in the possession of a
11276,“C. L.”,"pair of wings to flap about with, like “_a sort of celestial poultry_.”"
11277,“C. L.”,"After dinner he got up, and began pacing to and fro, with his hands"
11278,“C. L.”,"behind his back, talking and walking, as Lamb laughingly hinted, as"
11279,“C. L.”,if qualifying for an itinerant preacher; now fetching a simile from
11280,“C. L.”,"Loddiges’ garden, at Hackney; and then flying off for an illustration"
11281,“C. L.”,"to the sugar-making in Jamaica. With his fine, flowing voice, it was"
11282,“C. L.”,"glorious music, of the “never-ending, still-beginning” kind; and you"
11283,“C. L.”,"did not wish it to end. It was rare flying, as in the Nassau Balloon;"
11284,“C. L.”,"you knew not whither, nor did you care. Like his own bright-eyed"
11285,“C. L.”,"Marinere, he had a spell in his voice that would not let you go. To"
11286,“C. L.”,"attempt to describe my own feeling afterward, I had been carried,"
11287,“C. L.”,"spiralling, up to heaven by a whirlwind intertwisted with sunbeams,"
11288,“C. L.”,"giddy and dazzled, but not displeased, and had then been rained down"
11289,“C. L.”,again with a shower of mundane stocks and stones that battered out of
11290,“C. L.”,"me all recollection of what I had heard, and what I had seen!"
11291,“C. L.”,
11292,“C. L.”,"On the second occasion, the author of Christabel was accompanied by one"
11293,“C. L.”,"of his sons. The Poet, talking and walking as usual, chanced to pursue"
11294,“C. L.”,"some argument, which drew from the son, who had not been introduced"
11295,“C. L.”,"to me, the remark, “Ah, that’s just like your crying up those foolish"
11296,“C. L.”,"Odes and Addresses!” Coleridge was highly amused with this mal-àpropos,"
11297,“C. L.”,"and, without explaining, looked slily round at me, with the sort of"
11298,“C. L.”,suppressed laugh one may suppose to belong to the Bey of _Tittery_. The
11299,“C. L.”,"truth was, he felt naturally partial to a book he had attributed in the"
11300,“C. L.”,first instance to the dearest of his friends.
11301,“C. L.”,
11302,“C. L.”,"“MY DEAR CHARLES,--This afternoon, a little, thin,"
11303,“C. L.”,"mean-looking sort of a foolscap, sub-octavo of poems, printed on"
11304,“C. L.”,"very dingy outsides, lay on the table, which the cover informed me"
11305,“C. L.”,"was circulating in our book-club, so very Grub Streetish in all its"
11306,“C. L.”,"appearance, internal as well as external, that I cannot explain"
11307,“C. L.”,by what accident of impulse (assuredly there was no _motive_ in
11308,“C. L.”,"play) I came to look into it. Least of all, the title, Odes and"
11309,“C. L.”,"Addresses to Great Men, which connected itself in my head with"
11310,“C. L.”,"Rejected Addresses, and all the Smith and Theodore Hook squad. But,"
11311,“C. L.”,"my dear Charles, it was certainly written by you, or under you,"
11312,“C. L.”,or _una cum_ you. I know none of your frequent visitors capacious
11313,“C. L.”,and assimilative enough of your converse to have reproduced you
11314,“C. L.”,"so honestly, supposing you had left yourself in pledge in his"
11315,“C. L.”,"lock-up house. Gillman, to whom I read the spirited parody on the"
11316,“C. L.”,"introduction to Peter Bell, the Ode to the Great Unknown, and to"
11317,“C. L.”,Mrs. Fry; he speaks doubtfully of Reynolds and Hood. But here come
11318,“C. L.”,Irving and Basil Montagu.
11319,“C. L.”,
11320,“C. L.”,"“_Thursday night, 10 o’clock._--No! Charles, it is _you_. I have"
11321,“C. L.”,"read them over again, and I understand why you have _anon’d_"
11322,“C. L.”,the book. The puns are nine in ten good--many excellent--the
11323,“C. L.”,_Newgatory_ transcendent. And then the _exemplum sine exemplo_ of
11324,“C. L.”,"a volume of personalities and contemporaneities, without a single"
11325,“C. L.”,line that could inflict the infinitesimal of an unpleasance on any
11326,“C. L.”,man in his senses; saving and except perhaps in the envy-addled
11327,“C. L.”,"brain of the despiser of your _Lays_. If not a triumph over him,"
11328,“C. L.”,"it is at least an _ovation_. Then, moreover, and besides, to speak"
11329,“C. L.”,"with becoming modesty, excepting my own self, who is there but you"
11330,“C. L.”,who could write the musical lines and stanzas that are intermixed?
11331,“C. L.”,
11332,“C. L.”,"“Here Gillman, come up to my garret, and driven back by the"

11339,“C. L.”,"say! so, Mr. Charles! hang yourself up, and send me a line, by way"
11340,“C. L.”,of token and acknowledgment. My dear love to Mary. God bless you

11344,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,
11345,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"It may be mentioned here, that instead of feeling “the infinitesimal of"
11346,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"an unpleasance” at being Addressed in the Odes, the once celebrated Mr."
11347,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"Hunt presented to the Authors a bottle of his best “Permanent Ink,” and"
11348,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,the eccentric Doctor Kitchiner sent an invitation to dinner.

11350,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"From Colebrooke, Lamb removed to Enfield Chase,--a painful operation"
11351,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"at all times, for as he feelingly misapplied Wordsworth, “the _moving_"
11352,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"accident was not his trade.” As soon as he was settled, I called upon"
11353,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"him, and found him in a bald-looking yellowish house, with a bit of a"
11354,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"garden, and a wasp’s nest convanient, as the Irish say, for one stung"
11355,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"my pony as he stood at the door. Lamb laughed at the fun; but, as the"
11356,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"clown says, the whirligig of time brought round its revenges. He was"
11357,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"one day bantering my wife on her dread of wasps, when all at once he"
11358,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"uttered a horrible shout,--a wounded specimen of the species had slily"
11359,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"crawled up the leg of the table, and stung him in the thumb. I told"
11360,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"him it was a refutation well put in, like Smollett’s timely snowball."
11361,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"“Yes,” said he, “and a stinging commentary on Macbeth--"

11365,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,
11366,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,There were no pastoral yearnings concerned in this Enfield removal.
11367,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,There is no doubt which of Captain Morris’s Town and Country Songs
11368,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,would have been most to Lamb’s taste. “The sweet shady side of
11369,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"Pall-Mall,” would have carried it hollow. In courtesy to a friend, he"
11370,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"would select a green lane for a ramble, but left to himself, he took"
11371,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"the turnpike road as often as otherwise. “Scott,” says Cunningham, “was"
11372,“S. T. COLERIDGE.”,"a stout walker.” Lamb was a _porter_ one. He calculated Distances,"

11663,“A. B.,"[4]  To borrow an example from fiction, there is that slave of"
11664,“A. B.,"circumstances, Oliver Twist. There are few authors whom one"
11665,“A. B.,would care to see running two heats with the same horse. It
11666,“A. B.,"is intended therefore as a compliment, that I wish Boz would"
11667,“A. B.,"re-write the history in question from page 122, supposing his"
11668,“A. B.,hero NOT to have met with the Artful Dodger on his road to seek
11669,“A. B.,his fortune.
11670,“A. B.,
11671,“A. B.,"[5]  In justice to the Society, it ought to be recorded, that two"
11672,“A. B.,of its members have since distinguished themselves in print: the
11673,“A. B.,"authoress of “London in the Olden Time,” and the author of a"
11674,“A. B.,“History of Moral Science.”
11675,“A. B.,
11676,“A. B.,"[6]  There was a dash of ink in my blood. My father wrote two novels,"
11677,“A. B.,"and my brother was decidedly of a literary turn, to the great"
11678,“A. B.,"disquietude for a time of an anxious parent. She suspected him,"
11679,“A. B.,on the strength of several amatory poems of a very desponding
11680,“A. B.,"cast, of being the victim of a hopeless attachment; so he was"
11681,“A. B.,"caught, closeted, and catechised, and after a deal of delicate"
11682,“A. B.,"and tender sounding, he confessed, not with the anticipated"
11683,“A. B.,"sighs and tears, but a very unexpected burst of laughter, that"
11684,“A. B.,he had been guilty of translating some fragments of Petrarch.
11685,“A. B.,
11686,“A. B.,"[7]  A cottage of Ungentility, for it had neither double coach-house"
11687,“A. B.,"nor wings. Like its tenant, it stood alone. He said, glancing at"
11688,“A. B.,"the Paternoster one, that he did not like “the Row.” There was"
11689,“A. B.,"a bit of a garden, in which, being, as he professed, “more fond"
11690,“A. B.,"of Men Sects than of Insects,” he made probably his first and"
11691,“A. B.,last observation in Entomology. He had been watching a spider
11692,“A. B.,"on a gooseberry bush, entrapping a fly. “Good God,” he said, “I"
11693,“A. B.,"never saw such a thing! Directly he was caught, in her fatal"
11694,“A. B.,"spinning, she darted down upon him, and in a minute turned him"
11695,“A. B.,"out, completely lapped in a shroud! It reminded me of the Fatal"
11696,“A. B.,Sisters in Gray.”
11697,“A. B.,
11698,“A. B.,"[8]  A sort of rheumatic celerity, of which Sir W. Scott’s favourite"
11699,“A. B.,dramatiser seemed to have a very accurate notion. Those who
11700,“A. B.,"remember “poor Terry’s” deliberate delivery, will be able to"
11701,“A. B.,"account, for the shout of laughter which once rang throughout"
11702,“A. B.,"the Adelphi green-room, at his emphatic manner of giving,"
11703,“A. B.,"from a manuscript-play, the stage direction of “Enter----,"
11704,“A. B.,with--a--lack--ri--ty!”
11705,“A. B.,
11706,“A. B.,"[9]  As regards his Unitarianism, it strikes me as more probable"
11707,“A. B.,that he was what the unco guid people call “Nothing at all.”
11708,“A. B.,which means that he was every thing but a Bigot. As he was in
11709,“A. B.,"spirit an Old Author, so was he in faith an Ancient Christian,"
11710,“A. B.,too ancient to belong to any of the modern sub-hubbub-divisions
11711,“A. B.,"of--Ists,--Arians, and--Inians."
11712,“A. B.,
11713,“A. B.,"[10] Talking of Poetry, Lamb told me one day that he had just met"
11714,“A. B.,with the most vigorous line he had ever read. “Where?” “Out of
11715,“A. B.,"the Camden’s Head, all in one line--"
11716,“A. B.,
11717,“A. B.,“To _One Hundred Pots of Porter_      £2 1 8”
11718,“A. B.,
11719,“A. B.,[11] Somebody happened to say that the Peasant ought to figure in
11720,“A. B.,"the Percy Anecdotes, as an example of uncultivated genius. “And"
11721,“A. B.,"where will they stick me?” asked Clare, “will they stick me in"
11722,“A. B.,the instinct?”
11723,“A. B.,
11724,“A. B.,[12] I once cut out from a country newspaper what seemed to me a very
11725,“A. B.,"good old English poem. It proved to be a _naturalization_, by"
11726,“A. B.,"Cary, of a French Song to April, by Remy Belleau."
11727,“A. B.,
11728,“A. B.,[13] The father expressing an uncertainty to what profession he
11729,“A. B.,"should devote a younger Cary, Lamb said, “Make him an"
11730,“A. B.,Apothe-Cary.”
11731,“A. B.,
11732,“A. B.,[14] Unable to make any thing “like a likeness” of a sitter for the
11733,“A. B.,"purpose, I have a sort of Irish faculty for taking faces behind"
11734,“A. B.,their backs. But my pencil has not been guilty of half the
11735,“A. B.,personalities attributed to it; amongst others “a formidable
11736,“A. B.,likeness of a Lombard Street Banker.” Besides that one would
11737,“A. B.,"rather draw on a Banker than at him, I have never seen the"
11738,“A. B.,"Gentleman alluded to, or even a portrait of him in my life."
11739,“A. B.,
11740,“A. B.,"[15] On a visit to Norfolk, I was much surprised to find that Opium,"
11741,“A. B.,"or Opie, as it was vulgarly called, was quite in common use in"
11742,“A. B.,"the form of pills amongst the lower classes, _in the vicinity"
11743,“A. B.,of the Fens_. It is not probable that persons in such a rank
11744,“A. B.,"of life had read the Confessions,--or, might not one suspect"
11745,“A. B.,"that as Dennis Brulgruddery was driven to drink by the stale,"
11746,“A. B.,"flat and unprofitable prospects of Muckslush Heath, so the"
11747,“A. B.,Fen-People in the dreary foggy cloggy boggy wastes of Cambridge
11748,“A. B.,"and Lincolnshire, had flown to the Drug for the sake of the"

11761,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,
11762,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,
11763,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,THERE is no estimate more ludicrous than that which is formed by
11764,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,unthinking persons of the powers of Authors. Thus when a gentleman
11765,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,"has once written a Book, say, on Domestic Medicine, it is popularly"
11766,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,supposed that he is competent to compose a work on any subject
11767,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,"whatever, from Transcendental Philosophy down to Five Minutes’ Advice"
11768,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,on the Teeth. Something of the kind is observable in the Autobiography
11769,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,"of Brasbridge, the Silversmith, of Fleet Street, who tells us that"
11770,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,"after the publication of his Memoirs, he was hailed by a fellow-citizen"
11771,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,"with “So you have written a book!--why, for the future I shall call you"
11772,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,Shakspeare!” as if the recorder of a set of “fiddle-headed” anecdotes
11773,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,"became, ipso facto, on a par with the creator of Othello. For another"
11774,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,instance I can refer to my own humble experience. The anti-antiquarian
11775,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,nature of my literary researches is sufficiently well known; yet it
11776,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,did not prevent a grave retrospective-looking gentleman from one day
11777,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,concluding an account of some inedited architectural remains near
11778,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,"Whitehall, with--“I wonder now that _you_, as a writer, have never"
11779,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,taken up the subject!” The worthy F.A.S. might as well have suggested
11780,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,a plot for a Farce to Sylvanus Urban;--but such is the general
11781,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,opinion of the universality of a genius that prints. Bearing this
11782,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,"tendency in mind, it will not seem so extraordinary that the following"
11783,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,correspondence should be placed in the hands of the Editor of the Comic
11784,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,"Annual by a respectable tradesman, who affirmed with tears in his eyes,"
11785,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,"that “it was a grave subject, worthy of the serious consideration of"
11786,THE CARNABY CORRESPONDENCE.,the Public.”

11951,"DEAR FATHER,",to keep pigs. I suppose then we shall have measely pork to match the
11952,"DEAR FATHER,",stinking beef. The fellows say its because the Doctor swops Stokes’s
11953,"DEAR FATHER,",schooling agin butchers meat and as the edication is so very bad old
11954,"DEAR FATHER,",Stokes on his part wont send in any better quality. Thats whats called
11955,"DEAR FATHER,",mutual accommodation in the newspapers. Give my love to Mrs. Rumsey
11956,"DEAR FATHER,","with thanks for the plum cake only next time more sweetmeat, and say"
11957,"DEAR FATHER,",I am almost sure I sometimes sleep in a damp bed. I am certain sure
11958,"DEAR FATHER,","Mrs. Rumsey would advise you the same as I do, namely for me to be"
11959,"DEAR FATHER,","took away, without running more risks, if it was only for fear of Mac"
11960,"DEAR FATHER,","Kenzie, for hes a regular tyrant and hectors over us all. Hes three"
11961,"DEAR FATHER,","parts a nigger and you cant punch his head so as to do any good, and"
11962,"DEAR FATHER,",only last Monday he was horsed for wanting to googe little Jones’s eyes
11963,"DEAR FATHER,",out and for nothing at all but just looking at his towel to see if the
11964,"DEAR FATHER,",black come off. I am ready to take my drop down dead if it is not all
11965,"DEAR FATHER,","faithfully true, Mac Kenzie and the beef and the Footman and all, and"
11966,"DEAR FATHER,",I do hope you will trust to my word and be agreeable to my offer to be
11967,"DEAR FATHER,",took away and I do hope it will be before next Saturday for that’s Mr.
11968,"DEAR FATHER,","Paynes visiting day, the Drawing Master as I call him, but some of the"
11969,"DEAR FATHER,",fellows have nick named him Sinbad because he hunted the elephants so
11970,"DEAR FATHER,",for their teeth. Philip Frank says theres a capital school at Richmond
11971,"DEAR FATHER,",where the Master permits fishing and boating and cigars and gunpowder
11972,"DEAR FATHER,",and poney chaises for only sixty guineas a year. I often think if my
11973,"DEAR FATHER,",poor dear late Mother was alive it is just the genteel sort of School
11974,"DEAR FATHER,",she would like me to be finished off at. But thats as you prefer and
11975,"DEAR FATHER,",if you will only promise upon your honour to remove me I wont run
11976,"DEAR FATHER,",away. I forgot to say I have very bad head akes sometimes besides the
11977,"DEAR FATHER,",stomach akes and last week I was up in the nussery for being feverish
11978,"DEAR FATHER,","and spotty, and I had to take antimonious wine but nothing made me sick"
11979,"DEAR FATHER,",except the gruel. Precious stuff it is and tastes like slate pencil
11980,"DEAR FATHER,",dust and salt. I was in great hopes it was scarlet fever or something
11981,"DEAR FATHER,","catching that I might be sent home to you, but the fisician said my"
11982,"DEAR FATHER,",rash was only chickings or stinging nettles. Altogether I am so unhappy
11983,"DEAR FATHER,",at not getting on in my learning that I do beg and pray to be took
11984,"DEAR FATHER,","away, and I will be very dutiful and grateful all the rest of my days."
11985,"DEAR FATHER,","Do, pray, do, and consider me down on my bended knees. And I will wish"
11986,"DEAR FATHER,","you every comfort in life if you will only provide for mine, and I will"
11987,"DEAR FATHER,","pray for your gout to go away for ever and ever, and then I will nurse"
11988,"DEAR FATHER,",your last days and be such a good son to you as never was except me.
11989,"DEAR FATHER,",And in that case I owe three shillings to the footman and shouldn’t
11990,"DEAR FATHER,",like to leave the school in debt. I shall expect to see you come in all
11991,"DEAR FATHER,",the coaches that go the road or at least that you will fetch me in a
11992,"DEAR FATHER,","letter, and if I am disappointed I really do believe I shall go off my"
11993,"DEAR FATHER,",head or something. With which I remain
11994,"DEAR FATHER,",
11995,"DEAR FATHER,","Dear Father,"
11996,"DEAR FATHER,","Your dutiful and affectionate Son,"

12005,"DEAR BROTHER,","DEAR BROTHER,"
12006,"DEAR BROTHER,",
12007,"DEAR BROTHER,",This is to acknowledge the favour of your family letter with
12008,"DEAR BROTHER,","enclosures, which came to hand as pleasant and welcome as a 4-inch"
12009,"DEAR BROTHER,","shell, that is no great treat of itself, and discharges a worse lot"
12010,"DEAR BROTHER,",of botheration from its inside. Between both I got as Port Royal a
12011,"DEAR BROTHER,","headache as a man need desire from a bottle of new rum, for which, as"
12012,"DEAR BROTHER,","it’s not unbrotherly to swear at a nevy, “dear Bob” and his school be"
12013,"DEAR BROTHER,","d--d. As to my not answering letters, I _always_ do, provided they are"
12014,"DEAR BROTHER,","either saucy or challenging; in which case, like answering a broadside,"
12015,"DEAR BROTHER,",it’s a point of duty and honour to return as good as you get;--but for
12016,"DEAR BROTHER,","swopping sweet civil lollipop letters, lick for lick, it’s more than I"
12017,"DEAR BROTHER,","would do with any female alive, let alone a man. And when yours are not"
12018,"DEAR BROTHER,","lollipopping, they’re snivelling, or else both together, as the case"
12019,"DEAR BROTHER,",is now. However blood’s blood: and so for once I will commit what you
12020,"DEAR BROTHER,","want, rather than accept your invite, and go up to help you and that"
12021,"DEAR BROTHER,","old dry red cow, Mother Rumsey, to chew the cud of the matter all over"
12022,"DEAR BROTHER,","again by word of mouth. As for harrowing up my feelings, or ploughing"
12023,"DEAR BROTHER,","them up either, thank my stars it’s a stiffer soil than that comes to."
12024,"DEAR BROTHER,","Why, my feelings are as tough--and not without need--as a bull-beef"
12025,"DEAR BROTHER,","steak fresh killed, and take quite as much pitching into before they’re"
12026,"DEAR BROTHER,","as tender as you suppose. Likely it is, that a man who has rammed his"
12027,"DEAR BROTHER,","head, as I have in Africa, into a stuck camel for a secondhand swig at"
12028,"DEAR BROTHER,","his cistern, would come within sixty degrees of the notion of pitying"
12029,"DEAR BROTHER,",a lubberly school-boy for having as much as ever he could swill of
12030,"DEAR BROTHER,","sour swipes! Then for bad food, the stinkingest beef I ever met with"
12031,"DEAR BROTHER,","was none to be had, good or bad, except the smell of the empty barrel."
12032,"DEAR BROTHER,",That’s something like what you call being pincht in my fud; and so it
12033,"DEAR BROTHER,","was I reckon when I gave my watch, and a good seven shilling piece"
12034,"DEAR BROTHER,","besides, for about a pound of pork cartridges. So I’m not going to"
12035,"DEAR BROTHER,",pipe my eye at dear Bob’s short commons neither. It’s all very well
12036,"DEAR BROTHER,",for pap-boating mothers to admire fat babbies while they’re on the
12037,"DEAR BROTHER,","lap; but the whole human breed would be spoiled, if Mother Nature"
12038,"DEAR BROTHER,",did not unspoil it again by sending us now and then to the School
12039,"DEAR BROTHER,","of Adversity, without a knife and fork and a spoon. I came in for a"
12040,"DEAR BROTHER,","quarter’s learning there myself, in the Desart as aforesaid, and one of"
12041,"DEAR BROTHER,","the lessons I learnt was from the ostriches; namely, when you can’t"
12042,"DEAR BROTHER,","get a regular cargo of food, you must go in ballast with old shoes,"
12043,"DEAR BROTHER,","leather caps, or any other odd matters you can pick up. There’s nothing"
12044,"DEAR BROTHER,","in life like bringing chaps up hardy, if they’re to stand the hammering"
12045,"DEAR BROTHER,","we’re all born to, provided we are born alive. I once heard a clever"
12046,"DEAR BROTHER,","Yankee arguing to the same point. “Rear up your lads,” says he, “like"
12047,"DEAR BROTHER,","nails; and then they’ll not only go through the world, but you may"
12048,"DEAR BROTHER,","clench ’em on t’other side.” And for my part, if I was a father, which"
12049,"DEAR BROTHER,","thank God I am not, to my knowledge, I would mark down a week of Banyan"
12050,"DEAR BROTHER,","days to every month in the Almanack, just to accustom the youngsters to"
12051,"DEAR BROTHER,","take in and let out their bread bags, till it came natural; like the"
12052,"DEAR BROTHER,","Laps and Esquimaux, who spend their lives in a feast and a fast, turn"
12053,"DEAR BROTHER,","and turn about, whereby their insides get as elastic as India rubber,"
12054,"DEAR BROTHER,","and accommodate themselves to their loading, chock full or clean, as"
12055,"DEAR BROTHER,",falls out. I’ve known the time I would have given all my prize-money
12056,"DEAR BROTHER,","for a set of linings of the same conveniency, as when it was coming"
12057,"DEAR BROTHER,","to the toss-up of a cowry whether I was to eat Tom Pike, or Tom Pike"
12058,"DEAR BROTHER,","was to eat me. Just read the North Pole Voyages, and you will see that"
12059,"DEAR BROTHER,",pampering bellies is not the exact course to make Captain Backs. So
12060,"DEAR BROTHER,","for all that’s been made on that tack, hitherto, you owe nothing but a"
12061,"DEAR BROTHER,","higher rating to Doctor Darby, provided there’s any step above Doctor"
12062,"DEAR BROTHER,",in his service; I’ll even go so far as stand my share towards a bit
12063,"DEAR BROTHER,","of plate to him, for not making my nevy a loblolly milk-sop. That’s"
12064,"DEAR BROTHER,",my notion about hard fare. To be sure there was Mother Brownrigg was
12065,"DEAR BROTHER,",hung for going a little too near the wind in her ‘prentices’ insides;
12066,"DEAR BROTHER,","but if the balance was squared, a few of the other old women would be"
12067,"DEAR BROTHER,","run up to the yard-arm, for slow poisoning the rising generation with"
12068,"DEAR BROTHER,",sugar-plum cakes and kickshaw tarts. And that your dear Bob has got
12069,"DEAR BROTHER,","a rare sweet tooth of his own is as plain as the Pike of Teneriffe,"
12070,"DEAR BROTHER,",for it sticks out like a Barbary wild boar’s tusks all through his
12071,"DEAR BROTHER,","precious complaints. Whereby you had better clap a stopper on in time,"
12072,"DEAR BROTHER,","unless mayhap you want him to grow up in the fashion, which seems"
12073,"DEAR BROTHER,","now-a-days for our young men to know, and think, and talk, aye and"
12074,"DEAR BROTHER,","write too, about kitchen craft,--with their _pully olays_ and _volley"
12075,"DEAR BROTHER,",vongs_--as if they was so many cook’s mates at a French hotel. There’s
12076,"DEAR BROTHER,","no disputing likings, but rather than be such a macaroni dishclout"
12077,"DEAR BROTHER,","dandy, as delicate as a lap-dog, I’d be a turnspit’s whelp at once, and"
12078,"DEAR BROTHER,",sit up on my hind legs a-begging for the sop in the pan. Now if you’re
12079,"DEAR BROTHER,","for his being one of those unabled-bodied objects of creation, I’ve"
12080,"DEAR BROTHER,","no more to say; for you have got the right bearings, and have only to"
12081,"DEAR BROTHER,",stand on till you bring dear Bob and Molly Coddle into one. But if so
12082,"DEAR BROTHER,",be on the contrary you have gumption enough to want to claw off that
12083,"DEAR BROTHER,","point, then down helm at once, and cut Mother Rumsey adrift, plum"
12084,"DEAR BROTHER,",cakes and all. I’ve long had on my mind to drop you a word of advice
12085,"DEAR BROTHER,","against that old catamaran, who knows fast enough that two bears’ heads"
12086,"DEAR BROTHER,",are never so likely to rub together as when they’re a-licking the same
12087,"DEAR BROTHER,","cub. By the cub I mean my nevy, and the two old ones are you and Mother"
12088,"DEAR BROTHER,",R. Besides it’s been my observation through life. Many’s the young man
12089,"DEAR BROTHER,","and woman will live for years together in the same house, or make the"
12090,"DEAR BROTHER,","India voyage together in the same ship, without hooking on, or even"
12091,"DEAR BROTHER,","coming in sight of such a notion; but neither I, nor anybody else, ever"
12092,"DEAR BROTHER,","saw two old ones, he and she, in the like case, without their coming at"
12093,"DEAR BROTHER,",long and at last to a splice in church. So it is with an old cat and
12094,"DEAR BROTHER,","dog, that while they had a tooth in their heads could hardly abide in"
12095,"DEAR BROTHER,","the same parish, whereas when they get on the superannuated list, you"
12096,"DEAR BROTHER,","will see them as thick as thieves, and messing together in the same"
12097,"DEAR BROTHER,","dish. The philosophy of it is more than I pretend to know, unless it be"
12098,"DEAR BROTHER,","they’re past fighting, and fit for no active sort of work;--but so it"
12099,"DEAR BROTHER,","is, as sure as the sea is salt. You had best then part company at once,"
12100,"DEAR BROTHER,","if you don’t want to see dear Bob mast-headed up to the back garret, or"
12101,"DEAR BROTHER,","cooped down in the coal-cellar, on monkey’s allowance; such being the"
12102,"DEAR BROTHER,",first steps a stepmother always takes in any story-book I ever read.
12103,"DEAR BROTHER,",I’m for my nevy having fair-play after all. So as I’ve subscribed to
12104,"DEAR BROTHER,","the bit of plate to Dr. Darby for case-hardening the fellow’s carcass,"
12105,"DEAR BROTHER,",you may set me down towards the spitefullest boatswain’s cat that ever
12106,"DEAR BROTHER,","was handled, in case it turns out he has neglected the boy’s mind."
12107,"DEAR BROTHER,",I’ve seen a man seized up for a much smaller offence than crimping and
12108,"DEAR BROTHER,","inveigling a long hundred of lads at a time to a Sham Abram school, and"
12109,"DEAR BROTHER,","swindling them out of the best part of the property about them, namely"
12110,"DEAR BROTHER,","their juvenile time. It is only a streak above kidnapping, seeing that"
12111,"DEAR BROTHER,",for any profit in learning the youngsters might as well spend their
12112,"DEAR BROTHER,",best years in the Plantations. Not but that Parents deserve a cobbing
12113,"DEAR BROTHER,",themselves for putting a boy under a master without asking to look at
12114,"DEAR BROTHER,","his certificates. As for the Latin and Greek, mayhap they’re no loss"
12115,"DEAR BROTHER,","to take on about. The dead and gone tongues for a tradesman’s son,"
12116,"DEAR BROTHER,","that’s going behind a counter, is much of a muchness with fitting up a"
12117,"DEAR BROTHER,",Newcastle collier’s cabin after the pattern of a Leith smack’s; only
12118,"DEAR BROTHER,",that the gilding and polishing may be grimed and grubbed off again in
12119,"DEAR BROTHER,","the course of trade. Still, considering they were paid for as work"
12120,"DEAR BROTHER,","done, in common honesty my nevy ought to have had them put in his"
12121,"DEAR BROTHER,","head; or at least something in lieu, such as Navigation or the like."
12122,"DEAR BROTHER,",His own mother tongue is quite a different matter; and thereupon I’ll
12123,"DEAR BROTHER,","give you my mind, upright and downright, of the two School-letters."
12124,"DEAR BROTHER,","To be sure the Doctor likes weight of metal, and fires away with the"
12125,"DEAR BROTHER,","high-soundingest words he can get, whereby his meaning is apt to loom"
12126,"DEAR BROTHER,","bigger than it is, like a fishing-boat in a fog; and where there’s"
12127,"DEAR BROTHER,","such a ground swell of language, a seaman is apt to think there’s no"
12128,"DEAR BROTHER,","great depth of ideas; but bating that, there’s nothing to shake a"
12129,"DEAR BROTHER,","rope’s end at, but quite the reverse, especially as to teaching the"
12130,"DEAR BROTHER,","youngsters to give three cheers for their king and country. Now, Dear"
12131,"DEAR BROTHER,","Bob’s letter-work on the other hand, with its complaints of hard fare,"
12132,"DEAR BROTHER,",is only fit to be sung by a snivelling Swiss beggar boy to his hurdy
12133,"DEAR BROTHER,","gurdy; besides many a chafe in the grammar and orthography, and being"
12134,"DEAR BROTHER,",writ in such a scrambling up and down fist as a drunken purser might
12135,"DEAR BROTHER,",scrawl in a gale of wind. Now it’s my opinion a landsman that hasn’t
12136,"DEAR BROTHER,",his hands made as hard as horn with hauling home sheets nor his fingers
12137,"DEAR BROTHER,","as stiff and sticky as pitch can make ’em, has it in his power to write"
12138,"DEAR BROTHER,",as fine penmanship as copperplate except for the want of good will. So
12139,"DEAR BROTHER,","that the fault may be set down to my nevy’s own account, and mayhap"
12140,"DEAR BROTHER,","many of the rest, for no doubt there are skulkers at school as well as"
12141,"DEAR BROTHER,","on board ship. My advice then is this, namely, just throw a shot across"
12142,"DEAR BROTHER,","Dr. Darby’s forefoot, to let him know you mean to overhaul him, and"
12143,"DEAR BROTHER,","demand a sight of the school log, and so forth; by which you will have"
12144,"DEAR BROTHER,",satisfaction one way or another; and putting the case he has gone to
12145,"DEAR BROTHER,","leeward of his duty, why, then come hammer and tongs, and blaze away at"
12146,"DEAR BROTHER,",him to your heart’s content. The next step in course will be to take my
12147,"DEAR BROTHER,","nevy from under his orders, and find him a berth in a well officered"
12148,"DEAR BROTHER,","ship; and I am ready so far to do an uncle’s part by the lad, as help"
12149,"DEAR BROTHER,",to look out for a proper well-appointed craft. That’s my advice whether
12150,"DEAR BROTHER,","you steer by it or not--and so no more at present, and not sorry to"
12151,"DEAR BROTHER,",belay--from
12152,"DEAR BROTHER,",

12343,"DEAR BROTHER,",
12344,"DEAR BROTHER,","Well, after a haul at the bell, and so forth, I was piloted into a"
12345,"DEAR BROTHER,","room, on the ground tier, by the footman, and a pastryfaced son of a"
12346,"DEAR BROTHER,","land cook he looked sure enough. Where, as soon as may be, Mrs. Doctor"
12347,"DEAR BROTHER,","Darby joins company, a tight little body enough, all bobbing up and"
12348,"DEAR BROTHER,","down with courtesys like the buoy at the Nore, and as oily tongued as"
12349,"DEAR BROTHER,","any rat in the Greenland Docks. By her own account, she rated a step"
12350,"DEAR BROTHER,","above Mother to six score of boys, big and little, and every man jack"
12351,"DEAR BROTHER,","of them more made of, and set store by, than if they had been parts"
12352,"DEAR BROTHER,","of her own live stock. All which flummery would go down with you, and"
12353,"DEAR BROTHER,","the marines, mayhap, but not with old sailors like me. As for dear"
12354,"DEAR BROTHER,","Bob, she buttered him of both sides, thick and threefold, as the best,"
12355,"DEAR BROTHER,","sweetest, darlingest, and what not young gentleman of the whole kit,"
12356,"DEAR BROTHER,","besides finding out a family likeness between him and his uncle, which"
12357,"DEAR BROTHER,","if it’s any feature at all, is all my eye. Next she enquired after"
12358,"DEAR BROTHER,","you, the worthiest parent she ever knew, not excepting her own father,"
12359,"DEAR BROTHER,",whereby I blest my stars you were not within hail; or you would have
12360,"DEAR BROTHER,","been flabbergasted in no time, with your eyes running like scuppers,"
12361,"DEAR BROTHER,",and your common senses on their beam ends. At long and last in comes my
12362,"DEAR BROTHER,","Nevy himself, as smooth and shining as a new copper; whereby says she,"
12363,"DEAR BROTHER,","“I hope you will excuse untidiness, and so forth, because of sending"
12364,"DEAR BROTHER,",for him just as he stood.” That’s how he came no doubt in his Sunday’s
12365,"DEAR BROTHER,",breeches; besides twigging the wet soap-suds in his ears. “Here my
12366,"DEAR BROTHER,","sweet love,” she sings out, “here’s your dear kind uncle so good as to"
12367,"DEAR BROTHER,","come to enquire after your welfare.” So dear Bob, heaves ahead, and"
12368,"DEAR BROTHER,","gets a kiss, not from me tho, and a liquorish lozenge for what she"
12369,"DEAR BROTHER,","called his nasty hack. Nothing however but a colic with parched peas,"
12370,"DEAR BROTHER,","as he owned to afterwards. “Now, then, Nevy,” says I, “what cheer--how"
12371,"DEAR BROTHER,",do you like your berth?” when up jumps Madam like a scalded cat; and
12372,"DEAR BROTHER,","no or yes, I must drink the favour of a glass of Sherry Rank Cape,"
12373,"DEAR BROTHER,","John, as ever was shipped. Then Master Robert, bless him, must have a"
12374,"DEAR BROTHER,","leetle glass too, but provided I approve, and a ration of sweet cake."
12375,"DEAR BROTHER,","Whereby says she, “Now I will leave you to your mutual confidences”--as"
12376,"DEAR BROTHER,","looked all fair and above board enough, if I had not made out a foot"
12377,"DEAR BROTHER,",near the door. And in the twinkling of a handspike in sails Dr. Darby
12378,"DEAR BROTHER,","himself, with as many scrapes to me as if I was Port Admiral; and as"
12379,"DEAR BROTHER,","anxious about my old gout,--for I’ve got an easy shoe for a bunion--as"
12380,"DEAR BROTHER,","if he’d been intimate with it in my great-grandfather’s time. Well, we"
12381,"DEAR BROTHER,","palavered a bit about the French news, and the weather, and the crops,"
12382,"DEAR BROTHER,","whatever you like, let alone book learning; but that was not my course,"
12383,"DEAR BROTHER,","and impatient to see Tom Pike, besides, so I ran slap aboard him at"
12384,"DEAR BROTHER,","once with an ask to see the school. As I looked for, he was took all"
12385,"DEAR BROTHER,","aback; however Madam wasn’t thrown so dead in the wind, but jumped up"
12386,"DEAR BROTHER,","to the bell tackle, and after a bit of a whisper with the servant, we"
12387,"DEAR BROTHER,",got under way for the school; but contrived to land somehow in the
12388,"DEAR BROTHER,","kitchen, with a long row of quartern loaves drawn up on a dresser to"
12389,"DEAR BROTHER,","receive us, like a file of marines. Then Madam begins to spin a long"
12390,"DEAR BROTHER,","yarn about plain food, but plenty of it, for growing youths--dear Bob’s"
12391,"DEAR BROTHER,","very lathy, John, for all that--and then comes the Doctor’s turn to"
12392,"DEAR BROTHER,","open with a preachment on animal foods, and what will digest, and what"
12393,"DEAR BROTHER,","won’t; tho’ for my own part, I never met with any meat but would do it"
12394,"DEAR BROTHER,","in time, more or less. So by way of clapping a stopper I made bold to"
12395,"DEAR BROTHER,","remind that time is short tho’ life is long, and thereby luffing slap"
12396,"DEAR BROTHER,","up to my Nevy, “Bob,” says I, “what’s the variation of the compass?”"
12397,"DEAR BROTHER,","So Master Bob turns it about a bit, and then says he, “Why, it’s one"
12398,"DEAR BROTHER,","leg shorter than t’other.” Which is about as nigh it, Brother, as you"
12399,"DEAR BROTHER,","are to Table Bay! And how it gave the Doctor a bad fit of coughing,"
12400,"DEAR BROTHER,",which his wife caught of him as natural as if it had been the hooping
12401,"DEAR BROTHER,","sort--at last says she, “Maybe Master Robert has not progressed yet"
12402,"DEAR BROTHER,","into navigation.” “Maybe not, Ma’am,” says I, “and so we’ll try on"
12403,"DEAR BROTHER,","another tack--Nevy, what’s metaphysics?” “Brimstone and Treacle,”"
12404,"DEAR BROTHER,","says Bob, as ready as gunpowder, and the lady looked as satisfied as"
12405,"DEAR BROTHER,","Bob did--but the Doctor had another bad fit, and good reason why, for"
12406,"DEAR BROTHER,",there’s no more physic in metaphysics than a baby might take in its
12407,"DEAR BROTHER,","pap. By this time we were going up stairs, but lay-to awhile alongside"
12408,"DEAR BROTHER,","a garden pump on the landing, to have a yarn about dowsing glims,"
12409,"DEAR BROTHER,","and fire guards, and going the rounds at night; and as dear Bob hung"
12410,"DEAR BROTHER,","astarn, I yawed, and let fly at him again with “What’s religion?” “The"
12411,"DEAR BROTHER,","colic on Sundays,” says he, as smart as you like; tho’ what he meant"
12412,"DEAR BROTHER,",by colic the Old Gentleman knows. However both the Doctor and Madam
12413,"DEAR BROTHER,","pulled a pleasant face at him, and looked as pleased as if he had found"
12414,"DEAR BROTHER,","out the longitude; but that was too fine weather to last, for thinks"
12415,"DEAR BROTHER,","I, in course he can carry on a little further on that board, so says"
12416,"DEAR BROTHER,","I, “What’s the main-top-gallant rule of Christianity?” “Six weeks at"
12417,"DEAR BROTHER,","Christmas,” says he, as bold as brass from getting encouraged before."
12418,"DEAR BROTHER,","So you see, John, he don’t know his own persuasion. In course we were"
12419,"DEAR BROTHER,",all at wry faces again; but the Doctor had the gumption to shove his
12420,"DEAR BROTHER,","out of a window, and sing out an order to nobody in the back yard. As"
12421,"DEAR BROTHER,","for Madam, she shot ahead into the sleeping rooms, where I saw half"
12422,"DEAR BROTHER,","a hundred of white dimity cots, two warming-pans, and nine clothes"
12423,"DEAR BROTHER,",baskets--Master Robert’s berth among the rest. Next we bore away
12424,"DEAR BROTHER,","by a long passage to the kitchen again, where two rounds of boiled"
12425,"DEAR BROTHER,","beef had been put to officer the quartern loaves, and so through the"
12426,"DEAR BROTHER,","washery and pot-and-pannery into the garden ground, where I came in"
12427,"DEAR BROTHER,",for as long a yarn about the wholesomeness of fresh vegetables and
12428,"DEAR BROTHER,","salads, as if the whole crew of youngsters had been on the books with"
12429,"DEAR BROTHER,",the scurvy. From the cabbages we got to the flowerbeds; and says the
12430,"DEAR BROTHER,","Doctor, “I don’t circumscribe, or circumvent, one or t’other; I don’t"
12431,"DEAR BROTHER,","circumvent my pupils to scholastical works, but encourage perusing the"
12432,"DEAR BROTHER,","book of Nature.”--“That’s very correct, then, Doctor,” said I, “and"
12433,"DEAR BROTHER,","my own sentiment exactly. Nevy, what’s Natural Philosophy?”--“Keeping"
12434,"DEAR BROTHER,","rabbits,” says Bob; which sounds likely enough, but it’s not the thing"
12435,"DEAR BROTHER,",by sixty degrees. I can’t say but I felt the cats’-paws coming over my
12436,"DEAR BROTHER,","temper; but I kept it under till we fetched the paddock, to look at the"
12437,"DEAR BROTHER,",cows; and that brought up another yarn about milk-dieting; and says
12438,"DEAR BROTHER,","Madam, “when summer comes, our Doctor is so good as to permit the young"
12439,"DEAR BROTHER,","gentlemen to make his hay.”--“No doubt alive, Ma’am,” says I; “saves"
12440,"DEAR BROTHER,","hands, and good fun too, eh, nevy?--What’s Agriculture?” However this"
12441,"DEAR BROTHER,","time dear Bob chose to play sulky, and wouldn’t answer good or bad;"
12442,"DEAR BROTHER,","whereby the Doctor crowds up, with a fresh question. “Now then, Master"
12443,"DEAR BROTHER,","Robert,” says he pretty sharp, “I will ask you something you _do_"
12444,"DEAR BROTHER,","know. What is Algebra,--Al--gebra?”--“Please Sir,” says Bob, “it’s a"
12445,"DEAR BROTHER,","wild donkey all over stripes.”--“There’s a dear boy!” cries Madam, the"
12446,"DEAR BROTHER,",more fool she; but old Darby looked as black as thunder at midnight.
12447,"DEAR BROTHER,","“I’m afraid,” says he, letting go the toplifts, as one may say, of his"
12448,"DEAR BROTHER,",eyebrows; “I’m afraid there has been a little slackness here with the
12449,"DEAR BROTHER,","cat; but, by your leave, Sir, and so forth, I will investigate a little"
12450,"DEAR BROTHER,","into it myself. Now Master Robert, take a pull at your mental tackle,"
12451,"DEAR BROTHER,",for I’m going to overhaul your Mathematics:--How do you describe a
12452,"DEAR BROTHER,","triangle?”--“Please Sir,” says Bob, “it’s the thing that tingle-tangles"
12453,"DEAR BROTHER,","to the big drum.” Well, there was the devil to pay again, and no pitch"
12454,"DEAR BROTHER,",hot! Old Darby looked as if he meant either to drop down dead on the
12455,"DEAR BROTHER,","spot of apoplexy, or to murder dear Bob; he swelled and reddened up"
12456,"DEAR BROTHER,","so about the wattles without hoisting out a word. For my own part,"
12457,"DEAR BROTHER,","nevy as he was, I couldn’t help serving him out a back-handed slap"
12458,"DEAR BROTHER,","of the head, and then I turned-to at the schoolmaster. “So, Mister"
12459,"DEAR BROTHER,","Doctor,” says I, “this is what you call a liberal education in your"
12460,"DEAR BROTHER,","manifest?”--“Sir,” says he, looking as stiff as a corporal just made,"
12461,"DEAR BROTHER,","“whatever your, some cursed long hard word may be, I cannot consider"
12462,"DEAR BROTHER,","myself liable for the lagging astern of, I must say, the dullest sailor"
12463,"DEAR BROTHER,","in my whole convoy.”--“Why, blood and thunder!” said I, for old Nick"
12464,"DEAR BROTHER,","could not have helped it--“you told me that Bob, my nevy there, was the"
12465,"DEAR BROTHER,","handiest and smartest of the whole kit!”--“That was _me_, Sir,” says"
12466,"DEAR BROTHER,","the lady hauling in between us--“and then I only spoke as to temper,"
12467,"DEAR BROTHER,",as Greek and Latin are beyond a female’s provinces”--which was true
12468,"DEAR BROTHER,","enough; so I felt bound to beg her pardon, which was granted: and"
12469,"DEAR BROTHER,","we had smooth water again till we neared the school-room. Now then,"
12470,"DEAR BROTHER,","thought I, look out for squalls, for my mind was made up to stand no"
12471,"DEAR BROTHER,","nonsense from the petty officers, that is to say, gentlemen ushers. So"
12472,"DEAR BROTHER,",I ranged up alongside the most mathematical looking one I could pick
12473,"DEAR BROTHER,","out, by way of having a bout with him at trigonometry; but he chose"
12474,"DEAR BROTHER,","to be as shy, and deaf and dumb, as a Gibraltar monkey just grabbed."
12475,"DEAR BROTHER,","“With submission, my good Sir,” says the Doctor, putting in his oar,"
12476,"DEAR BROTHER,","“Mr. Huckin may consider it a work of supereror-something, and a"
12477,"DEAR BROTHER,","going beyond ourselves, to re-examine him after the very satisfactory"
12478,"DEAR BROTHER,","certificates that satisfied _me_ myself.”--“That’s to say,” says I,"
12479,"DEAR BROTHER,","“in plain English, that I’m to get nothing but what I can screw out"
12480,"DEAR BROTHER,","of my nevy?”--“My dear Sir,” says the Doctor, “you misconstruct me"
12481,"DEAR BROTHER,",entirely--the whole of the juvenile pupils are open to candid scrutiny.
12482,"DEAR BROTHER,","Suppose we begin with the classics. Master Bush, Sir, you will English"
12483,"DEAR BROTHER,","me _hic_, _hac_, _hoc_.”--“This, that, and t’other,” says Master Bush;"
12484,"DEAR BROTHER,","no great shakes of an answer, I guess, but it seemed to serve for a"
12485,"DEAR BROTHER,","come-off. Then came my turn, so I asked who was the discoverer of"
12486,"DEAR BROTHER,","America? and may I never break biscuit again, if he didn’t say “Yankee"
12487,"DEAR BROTHER,","Doodle!” Well, to cut off the end of a long yarn, this was as good as"
12488,"DEAR BROTHER,",there was to be got out of the best of them. One told me that Guy Fox
12489,"DEAR BROTHER,",found out gunpowder; and another that a solar eclipse was along of the
12490,"DEAR BROTHER,","sun’s standing in its own light. What else I might have learned, that"
12491,"DEAR BROTHER,","I never knew before, must be left over for a guess; for in the middle"
12492,"DEAR BROTHER,","of the next ask, it was all hats aloft! and three cheers for a half"
12493,"DEAR BROTHER,","holiday; but if I had any hand in begging it, may I die ashore in a dry"
12494,"DEAR BROTHER,","ditch! However that was too much of a dog’s trick to be took quietly,"
12495,"DEAR BROTHER,","so I prepared a broadside, with a volley of oaths to it, by way of"
12496,"DEAR BROTHER,","small arms; but before I could well bring it to bear, the Doctor hauls"
12497,"DEAR BROTHER,","out his watch, and says he, “It’s extremely bad luck, but there’s a"
12498,"DEAR BROTHER,","voting this morning for a parish beadle, and I make a point not to let"
12499,"DEAR BROTHER,","my private duties get to windward of my public ones.” So saying, with"
12500,"DEAR BROTHER,","a half-and-half sort of a bow, to me, he cut and run; Madam getting"
12501,"DEAR BROTHER,",athwart hawse so as to cover his getting off. In course it was no use
12502,"DEAR BROTHER,",to waste speech upon her; but I made bold to d--n the whole covey of
12503,"DEAR BROTHER,","undermasters, in the lump, as a set of the sharkingest, loggerheaded,"
12504,"DEAR BROTHER,","flute-playing, skulking, lubberly sons of grinning weavers and tailors"
12505,"DEAR BROTHER,","that ever broke bread. So the finish over all is, that I took my nevy"
12506,"DEAR BROTHER,","away, traps and all; and not an hour too soon; and with Bob in tow"
12507,"DEAR BROTHER,","I made Tom Pike’s, who was as glad to see his old messmate as I was"
12508,"DEAR BROTHER,","to see him; and what’s more, when he heard the bit of a brush I had"
12509,"DEAR BROTHER,","enjoyed, he informed me that Doctor Darby, LL.D., and what not, was all"
12510,"DEAR BROTHER,","one and the same with Darby the shipchandler, that went to pieces down"
12511,"DEAR BROTHER,","at Wapping. You see then, as the chaplain says, that all’s for the best"
12512,"DEAR BROTHER,","either here or hereafter; and so no more, till Monday, when I shall"
12513,"DEAR BROTHER,","bring my nevy Bob to you, to make what you will of him, which I hope"
12514,"DEAR BROTHER,","will be as like a man as possible. If otherwise, I won’t promise not to"
12515,"DEAR BROTHER,","change my name by act of parliament, and so be no relation to dear Bob,"

12532,A RISE AT THE FATHER OF ANGLING.,
12533,A RISE AT THE FATHER OF ANGLING.,
12534,A RISE AT THE FATHER OF ANGLING.,THE memory of Izaak Walton has hitherto floated down the stream of
12535,A RISE AT THE FATHER OF ANGLING.,"time without even a nibble at it; but, alas! where is the long line"
12536,A RISE AT THE FATHER OF ANGLING.,so pure and even that does not come sooner or later to have a weak
12537,A RISE AT THE FATHER OF ANGLING.,length detected in it? The severest critic of Molière was an old
12538,A RISE AT THE FATHER OF ANGLING.,woman; and now a censor of the same sex takes upon herself to tax the
12539,A RISE AT THE FATHER OF ANGLING.,immortal work of our Piscator with holding out an evil temptation to
12540,A RISE AT THE FATHER OF ANGLING.,the rising generation Instead of concurring in the general admiration
12541,A RISE AT THE FATHER OF ANGLING.,"of his fascinating pictures of fishing, she boldly asserts that the"
12542,A RISE AT THE FATHER OF ANGLING.,"rod has been the spoiling of her child, and insists that in calling"
12543,A RISE AT THE FATHER OF ANGLING.,"the Angler gentle and inoffensive, the Author was altogether wrong in"
12544,A RISE AT THE FATHER OF ANGLING.,his _dubbing_. To render her strictures more attractive she has thrown
12545,A RISE AT THE FATHER OF ANGLING.,them into a poetical form; having probably learned by experience that
12546,A RISE AT THE FATHER OF ANGLING.,a rhyme at the end of a line is a very taking bait to the generality
12547,A RISE AT THE FATHER OF ANGLING.,of readers. Hark! how she rates the meek Palmer whom Winifred Jenkins
12548,A RISE AT THE FATHER OF ANGLING.,would have called “an angle upon earth!”

12722,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"and so frequently discussed, that one would suppose there was nothing"
12723,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"new to be felt or expressed on the subject. I was agreeably surprised,"
12724,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"therefore, during a late passage from Ireland, to hear the rights of"
12725,A SKETCH AT SEA.,an individual asserted in so very novel a manner as to seem worthy of
12726,A SKETCH AT SEA.,record. The injured party was an involuntary fellow-passenger; and
12727,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"the first glance at him as he leisurely ascended the cabin stairs,"
12728,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"bespoke him an original. His face, figure, dress, gait, ad gestures,"
12729,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"were all more or less eccentric; yet, without any apparent affectation"
12730,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"of singularity. His manner was perfectly earnest and business-like,"
12731,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"though quaint. On reaching the deck, his first movement was towards the"
12732,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"gangway, but a moment sufficed to acquaint him with the state of the"
12733,A SKETCH AT SEA.,case. The letter-bags having been detained an hour beyond the usual
12734,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"time of departure, the steam had been put on at a gallop, and Her"
12735,A SKETCH AT SEA.,Majesty’s mail packet the Guebre had already accomplished some hundred
12736,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"fathoms of her course. This untoward event, however, seemed rather"
12737,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"to surprise than annoy our Original, who quietly stepped up to the"
12738,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"Captain, with the air of demanding what was merely a matter of course:"
12739,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12740,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“Hollo, Skipper! Off she goes, eh? But you must turn about, my boy, and"
12741,A SKETCH AT SEA.,let me get out.”
12742,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12743,A SKETCH AT SEA.,[Illustration: “HE’S A-GOING TO TAKE A TOWER.”]
12744,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12745,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“Let you get out!” echoed the Skipper, and again repeating it, with"
12746,A SKETCH AT SEA.,what the musicians call a staccato--“Let--you--get--out!”
12747,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12748,A SKETCH AT SEA.,“Exactly so. I’m going ashore.”
12749,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12750,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“I’m rather afraid you are _not_, Sir,” said the Skipper, looking"
12751,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"decidedly serious, “unless you allude to the other side!”"
12752,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12753,A SKETCH AT SEA.,[Illustration: AN AQUATIC TRIP.]
12754,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12755,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“The other side!” exclaimed the Oddity, involuntarily turning towards"
12756,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"England. “Poo! poo! nonsense, man,--I only came to look at your"
12757,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"accommodations. I’m not going across with you--I’m not, upon my word!”"
12758,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12759,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“I must beg your pardon, Sir;” said the Captain, quite solemnly. “But"
12760,A SKETCH AT SEA.,it is my firm opinion that you _are_ ‘going across.’”
12761,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12762,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“Poo, poo! all gammon.--I till you I am going back to Dublin.”"
12763,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12764,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“Upon my soul, then,” said the Skipper, rather briskly, “you must swim"
12765,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"back like a grampus, or borrow a pair of wings from the gulls.”"
12766,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12767,A SKETCH AT SEA.,The man at the helm grinned his broadest at what he thought a good joke
12768,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"of his officer’s--while the Original turned sharply round, parodied a"
12769,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"hyena’s laugh at the fellow, and then returned to the charge."
12770,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12771,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“Come, come, Skipper--it’s quite as far out as I care for--if you want"
12772,A SKETCH AT SEA.,to treat me to a sail!”
12773,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12774,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“Treat you to a sail!” roared the indignant officer. “Zounds! Sir, I’m"
12775,A SKETCH AT SEA.,in earnest--as much in earnest as ever I was in my life.”
12776,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12777,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“So much the better,” answered the Original. “_I’m_ not joking myself,"
12778,A SKETCH AT SEA.,and I have no right to be joked upon.”
12779,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12780,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“Joke or no joke,” said the Captain--“all I know is this. The mail bags"
12781,A SKETCH AT SEA.,are on board--and it’s more than my post is worth to put back.”
12782,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12783,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“Eh? What? How?” exclaimed the Oddity, with a sort of nervous dance."
12784,A SKETCH AT SEA.,“You astonish me! Do--you--really--mean to say--I’m obligated to
12785,A SKETCH AT SEA.,go--whether I’ve a right or not?”
12786,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12787,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“I do indeed, Sir--I’m sorry for it, but it can’t be helped. My orders"
12788,A SKETCH AT SEA.,are positive. The moment the mail is on board I must cast off.”
12789,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12790,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“Indeed!--well--but you know--why, that’s _your_ duty, not _mine_. _I_"
12791,A SKETCH AT SEA.,have no right to be cast off! I’ve no right to be here at all. I’ve no
12792,A SKETCH AT SEA.,right to be anywhere--except in Merrion Square!”
12793,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12794,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"The Captain was bothered. He shrugged up his shoulders, then gave a"
12795,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"low whistle, then plunged his hands in his pockets--then gave a loud"
12796,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"order to somebody, to do something, somewhere or other; and then began"
12797,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"to walk short turns on the deck. His Captive, in the meantime, made"
12798,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"hasty strides towards the stern, as if intending to leap overboard; but"
12799,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"he suddenly stopped short, and took bewildered look at the receding"
12800,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"coast. The original wrong was visibly increasing in length, breadth,"
12801,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"and depth, every minute; and he again confronted the Captain."
12802,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12803,A SKETCH AT SEA.,[Illustration: DEEP DISTRESS PRODUCED BY MACHINERY.]
12804,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12805,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“Well, Skipper--you’ve thought better of it--I’ve no right in the"
12806,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"world, have I?--You will turn her round?”"
12807,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12808,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“Totally impossible, Sir--quite out of my power.”"
12809,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12810,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“Very well, very well, very well indeed!” the Original’s temper was"
12811,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"getting up as well as the sea. “But mind, Sir--I protest. I protest"
12812,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"against _you_, Sir--and against the ship--and the ocean, Sir--and"
12813,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"everything! I’m getting further and further out--but, remember, I’ve"
12814,A SKETCH AT SEA.,no _right_! You will take the consequences. I have no right to be
12815,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"kidnapped--ask the Crown lawyers, if you think fit!”"
12816,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12817,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"After this denouncement, the Speaker began to pace up and down like"
12818,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"the Captain, but at the opposite side of the deck. He was on the boil,"
12819,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"however, as well as the engine,--and every time that he passed near"
12820,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"the man whom he considered as his Sir Hudson Lowe, he gave vent to the"
12821,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"inward feeling in a jerk of the head, accompanied by a short pig-like"
12822,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"grunt. Now and then it broke out in words, but always the same four"
12823,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"monosyllables, “This--is--too--bad”--with a most emphatic fall of the"
12824,A SKETCH AT SEA.,foot to each. At last it occurred to a stout pompous-looking personage
12825,A SKETCH AT SEA.,to interpose as a mediator. He began by dilating on the immense
12826,A SKETCH AT SEA.,commercial importance of a punctual delivery of letters--thence he
12827,A SKETCH AT SEA.,insisted on the heavy responsibility of the Captain; with a promise
12828,A SKETCH AT SEA.,of an early return packet from Holyhead--and he was entering into
12829,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"a congratulation of the fineness of the weather, when the Original"
12830,A SKETCH AT SEA.,thought it was time to cut him short.
12831,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12832,A SKETCH AT SEA.,“My good Sir--you’ll excuse me. The case is nobody’s but my own. _You_
12833,A SKETCH AT SEA.,are a regular passenger. You have a right to be in this packet--you
12834,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"have a right to go to Holyhead--or to Liverpool--or to Gibraltar,--or"
12835,A SKETCH AT SEA.,to the world’s end--_if--you--like_. But _I_ choose to be in Dublin.
12836,A SKETCH AT SEA.,What right have I to be here then? Not--one--atom! I’ve no right to
12837,A SKETCH AT SEA.,be in this vessel--and the Captain there knows it. I’ve no right
12838,A SKETCH AT SEA.,(stamping) to be on this deck! I have no more right to be tossing at
12839,A SKETCH AT SEA.,sea (waving his arms up and down) than the Pigeon House!”
12840,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12841,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“It is a very unpleasant situation, I allow, Sir,” said the Captain"
12842,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"to the stout Passenger. “But, as I have told the gentleman, my hands"
12843,A SKETCH AT SEA.,are tied. I can do nothing--though nobody is more sorry for his
12844,A SKETCH AT SEA.,inconvenience.”
12845,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12846,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“Inconvenience be hanged!” exclaimed the Oddity, in a passion at last."
12847,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“It is NO inconvenience, Sir! Not--the--smallest. But that"
12848,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"makes no difference as to my being here. It’s that--and that alone,--I"
12849,A SKETCH AT SEA.,dispute all right to!”
12850,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12851,A SKETCH AT SEA.,[Illustration: SEA RIDDLE. “DO YOU GIVE IT UP?”]
12852,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12853,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“Well, but my dear, good Sir,” expostulated the pompous man; “admitting"
12854,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"the justice of your premises, the hardship is confessedly without"
12855,A SKETCH AT SEA.,remedy.”
12856,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12857,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“To be sure it is,” said the Captain, “every inch of it. All I can say"
12858,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"is, that the gentleman’s passage shall be no expense to him!”"
12859,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12860,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“Thankee--of _course_ not,” said the Original with a sneer. “I’ve no"
12861,A SKETCH AT SEA.,right to put my hand in my pocket! Not that I mind expense. But it’s
12862,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"my right I stand up for, and I defy you both to prove that I have any"
12863,A SKETCH AT SEA.,right--or any shadow of a right--to be in your company! I’ll tell you
12864,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"what, Skipper”--but before he could finish the sentence, he turned"
12865,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"suddenly pale, made a most grotesque wry face, and rushed forward to"
12866,A SKETCH AT SEA.,the bow of the vessel. The Captain exchanged a significant smile with
12867,A SKETCH AT SEA.,the stout gentleman; but before they had quite spoken their minds of
12868,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"the absent character, he came scrambling back to the binnacle, upon"
12869,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"which he rested with both hands, while he thrust his working visage"
12870,A SKETCH AT SEA.,within a foot of the skipper’s face.
12871,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12872,A SKETCH AT SEA.,[Illustration: “CHARMING SPOTS ABOUT THIS PART OF THE RIVER.”]
12873,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12874,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“There, Skipper!--now, Mr. What d’ye call--What do you both say to"
12875,A SKETCH AT SEA.,_that_? What right have I to be sick--as sick as a dog? I’ve no right
12876,A SKETCH AT SEA.,to be squeamish! I’m not a passenger. I’ve no right to go tumbling
12877,A SKETCH AT SEA.,over ropes and pails and what not to the ship’s head!”
12878,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12879,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“But my good Sir,”--began the pompous man."
12880,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12881,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“Don’t Sir me, Sir! _You_ took your own passage. You have a _right_ to"
12882,A SKETCH AT SEA.,be sick--You’ve a right to go to the side every five minutes--you’ve a
12883,A SKETCH AT SEA.,right to DIE of it! But it’s the reverse with me--I have no
12884,A SKETCH AT SEA.,right of the sort!”
12885,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12886,A SKETCH AT SEA.,[Illustration: “WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU IN MY STEEL TRAP?”]
12887,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12888,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“O certainly not, Sir,” said the pomposity, offended in his turn. “You"
12889,A SKETCH AT SEA.,are indubitably the best judge of your own privileges. I only beg to be
12890,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"allowed to remark, that where I felt I had so little right, I should"
12891,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"hesitate to intrude myself.” So saying, he bowed very formally, and"
12892,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"commenced his retreat to the cabin, while the Skipper pretended to"
12893,A SKETCH AT SEA.,examine the compass very minutely. In fact our Original had met with
12894,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"a chokepear. The fat man’s answer was too much for him, being framed"
12895,A SKETCH AT SEA.,on a principle clean contrary to his own peculiar system of logic. The
12896,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"more he tried to unravel its meaning, the more it got entangled. He"
12897,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"didn’t like it, without knowing why; and he quite disagreed with it,"
12898,A SKETCH AT SEA.,though ignorant of its purport. He looked up at the funnel--and at
12899,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"the flag--and at the deck,--and down the companion stairs,--and then"
12900,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"he wound up all by a long shake of his head, as mysterious as Lord"
12901,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"Burleigh’s, at the astonished man at the wheel. His mind seemed made"
12902,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"up. He buttoned his coat up to the very chin, as if to secure himself"
12903,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"to himself, and never opened his lips again till the vessel touched the"
12904,A SKETCH AT SEA.,quay at Holyhead. The Captain then attempted a final apology--but it
12905,A SKETCH AT SEA.,was interrupted in the middle.
12906,A SKETCH AT SEA.,
12907,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"“Enough said, Sir--quite enough. If you’ve _only_ done your duty,"
12908,A SKETCH AT SEA.,you’ve no right to beg pardon--and I’ve no right to ask it. All I mean
12909,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"to say is, here am I in Holyhead instead of Dublin. I don’t care what"
12910,A SKETCH AT SEA.,that fat fellow says--who don’t understand his own rights. I stick to
12911,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"all I said before. I have no right to be up in the Moon, have I? Of"
12912,A SKETCH AT SEA.,"course not--and I’ve no more right to stand on this present quay, than"
12913,A SKETCH AT SEA.,I have to be up in the Moon!”

12921,PATRONAGE.,"THE authenticity of the following letter will, probably, be disputed."
12922,PATRONAGE.,"The system of patronage to which it refers, is one very likely to shock"
12923,PATRONAGE.,"the prejudices of serious sober-minded persons, who will naturally"
12924,PATRONAGE.,refuse to credit such practical anachronisms as the superannuation of
12925,PATRONAGE.,"sucklings. Goldsmith, it is true, has mentioned certain Fortunatuses"
12926,PATRONAGE.,as being born with silver ladles in their mouths; but it would be
12927,PATRONAGE.,easier to suppose a child thus endowed with a whole service of plate
12928,PATRONAGE.,than to fancy one invested with a service of years. The most powerful
12929,PATRONAGE.,imagination would be puzzled to reconcile an Ex-Speakership with an
12930,PATRONAGE.,Infant untaught to lisp; or to recognise a retired Bow-street runner
12931,PATRONAGE.,in a nursling unable to walk. The existence of such very advanced
12932,PATRONAGE.,"posts for the Infantry is, however, affirmed; but with what truth,"
12933,PATRONAGE.,"from my total want of political experience, I am unable to judge. Mr."
12934,PATRONAGE.,"Wordsworth, indeed, who says that “the child is father of the man,”"
12935,PATRONAGE.,seems to aim a quiz at the practice; and possibly the nautical phrase
12936,PATRONAGE.,"of “getting a good _birth_,” may refer to such prosperous nativities."
12937,PATRONAGE.,"For the rest, grown gentlemen have unquestionably been thrust,"
12938,PATRONAGE.,"sometimes, into public niches to which they were as ill adapted as"
12939,PATRONAGE.,"Mr. D.; the measures taken by Patrons not leading invariably, like"
12940,PATRONAGE.,"Stultz’s, to admirable fits. But the Lady waits to speak her mind."

12955,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","a course; but I make bold to say, a case of greater hardship never had"
12956,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","the honour to be laid before official eyes. My poor husband, however,"
12957,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",is totally unaware of my writing; as he would certainly forbid any such

12959,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",fact the shattered state of his nerves is such as to preclude putting
12960,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","pen to paper if ever so inclined. But as a wife and a mother, it would"

12971,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","related very distantly to the Peerage; and as Your Lordship knows, it"

12973,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","comfortable public situations, which are sometimes enjoyed very early"
12974,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","in life. To such Mr. D. had a hereditary right from his cradle, for"
12975,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","his noble relative the Duke of----, was so condescending as to stand"
12976,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","sponsor by proxy; and instead of the usual spoons, or a silver mug,"
12977,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",made a promise to the Infant of some office suited to its tender age;
12978,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","for instance a superannuation, or the like, where there is nothing to"
12979,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","do, but the salary to receive. In point of fact, the making the Baby"
12980,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",a retired King’s Messenger was verbally undertaken at the font: but
12981,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",before the child could come into office His Grace unfortunately went
12982,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","out of power, by dying of apoplexy, leaving nothing but a promise,"
12983,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",which a new ministry was unjust and ungrateful enough not to make
12984,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","good. In this shocking manner, Your Lordship, was my husband thrown"
12985,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","upon the world, without proper provision according to his station and"
12986,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","prospects, and was degraded to the necessity of his own exertions for"
12987,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","support, till his fortieth year, when the new Duke thought proper to"
12988,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","stir in his behalf. The truth is, a severe illness had left Mr. D.’s"
12989,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","mind and nerves in such a pitiful shattered state, as to make him unfit"
12990,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","for any business whatever, except public affairs; and accordingly"
12991,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",it became the duty of his friends to procure him some post under
12992,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","government. So a proper application was made to his Grace, and through"
12993,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",his influence and the fortunate circumstance of an election at the
12994,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","time, Mr. D. was appointed to the dreadful situation he at present"
12995,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","enjoys. Of course we entirely acquit His Grace, who never set eyes on"
12996,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","my husband in his life, and therefore could not be expected to know"
12997,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","the precise state of his constitution; but I appeal to Your Lordship,"
12998,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","whether it was proper patronage for a man shattered in mind and nerves,"
12999,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","and subject to tremors, and palpitations, and bodily shocks of all"
13000,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","sorts, to be made a Superintendent of Powder-Mills, with the condition"
13001,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",of living attached to the works?
13002,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",
13003,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","For my own part, Your Lordship, I looked on the Duke’s letter of"
13004,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",congratulations as neither more nor less than my poor husband’s
13005,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","death-warrant. Indeed he was so dreadfully alarmed himself, as to be"
13006,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","quite distressing to witness. He did nothing, the whole afternoon,"
13007,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","but walk up and down the room, shaking his head at himself in the"
13008,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","looking-glass, or looking up at the ceiling, and muttering, as if he"
13009,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",was already exploding sky high along with the Mills. But a refusal
13010,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","was out of the question, as it would have afforded his Grace too good"
13011,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",an excuse for neglecting our interests for the future. To aggravate
13012,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","the case, the very day after our taking possession, there was what is"
13013,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","called a blow at the works, and though so trifling as only to carry a"
13014,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","roof off a shed, it struck a cord on Mr. D.’s nerves that has never"
13015,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","done vibrating ever since. I do not exaggerate to say, that if he had"
13016,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","been struck with the palsy and St. Vitus, both at once, he could not"
13017,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",have showed more corporeal agitation. He trembled in every limb like an
13018,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","aspen tree; while his eyes rolled, and his head went from side to side,"
13019,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","like the China Mandarin’s; besides scouring up and down stairs, and"
13020,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","rushing out of doors and in again, and trying all the chairs but could"
13021,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","not sit any where, and stamping, and muttering, and dancing about, till"
13022,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","I really expected he would scramble up the walls of the room, and fly"
13023,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","across the ceiling, like our tortoiseshell cat in her fits. If I lived"
13024,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","to Methusalem, Your Lordship, I should never forget it! Unluckily,"
13025,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","being new to his office, a mistaken notion of duty possessed him that"
13026,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","he ought not to quit the spot; indeed he solemnly declared, that if a"
13027,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","blow was to take place in his absence, he would rather commit his own"
13028,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","suicide than face the report of it in the newspapers, which had already"
13029,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",indulged in some seditious sneers at his appointment. All that could be
13030,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","done, therefore, was to pack off Lucy, and Emily and Eliza, on week’s"
13031,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","visits among friends; myself remaining behind, as a wife’s proper post,"
13032,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",near my poor husband; but on the discomfortable condition of keeping
13033,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","under ground in the cellar, because gunpowder in convulsions always"
13034,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","blasts upwards. What my feelings were, as we are troubled with rats,"
13035,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",Your Lordship may suppose; particularly when Mr. D. was officially
13036,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",called upon to inspect the damage; and never shall I forget his gashly
13037,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",appearance when he returned from his awful task! He was literally as
13038,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","white as a sheet; and totally incapable to get out a word, till he had"
13039,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","swallowed three whole glasses of brandy! That settled his reason,--but"
13040,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",it was only to tell me that lie had scraped and grazed the skin off
13041,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","every nubble of his back-bone, by a bad fall from a ladder, which he"
13042,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","had attempted to come down in wooden safety shoes. Such, Your Lordship,"
13043,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",was our miserable day; and it brought as wretched a night. Bed would
13044,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","not be heard of--and we set up in two easy chairs, shuddering with"
13045,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","fright and cold, being December, and every door and window thrown wide"
13046,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","open, to give a thorough vent through the house, in case of another"
13047,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",shock. For Mr. D. was unfortunately possessed that one blow always
13048,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","leads to another; and what with fancying flying sparks, for it was"
13049,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","starlight, and sniffing fire, he had worked himself up, before morning,"
13050,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",into a high fever and a light head. The nearest medical man was obliged
13051,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",to be called in--and he had to give frightful doses of laudanum before
13052,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",Mr. D.’s nerves could be lulled into a startlish sort of doze;--and at
13053,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","waking, he was ordered to drink the strongest stimuluses; as indeed are"
13054,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","in use to the present time. But this continual brandy, brandy, brandy,"
13055,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","as Your Lordship knows, is a dreadful remedy; though, as my poor"
13056,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","husband says, he cannot fill up his place without its help. At times"
13057,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","I could almost believe, tho’ I would not breathe such a thing except"
13058,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","to Your Lordship, that between the stimuluses, and the delirium, and"
13059,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","the whole shock to the system, Mr. D. is a little beside his senses."
13060,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","The mad Doctors do say, that we are all, every one of us, crazy on a"
13061,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","certain subject; and if such is the case, there can be no doubt that my"
13062,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","husband’s weak point is explosions, the extravagance of his precautions"
13063,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",making him an everlasting torment to himself as well as to all about
13064,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","him. Of course it is to his disadvantage, and magnifies his terrors,"
13065,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",not to have been brought regularly up to the business; not that he
13066,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","receives much comfort from those who have, for he says custom and"
13067,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","habit have made them so daring and hardened, that they would not mind"
13068,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","playing at snap-dragon in the Magazine, or grinding their knives on the"
13069,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",millstone that crushes the gunpowder into grains.

13074,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","but, as Your Lordship is aware, a first impression will stick by us"
13075,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","for all our lives to come. At the best of times, let my husband be"
13076,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","reading, or writing, or eating his dinner, or in bed, or what not, the"
13077,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",exploding notion will come across him like a flash of lightning; as
13078,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",for instance last Friday was a week. Mr. and Mrs. Trotter had dropped
13079,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","in to tea; after which we had a rubber; and were all very comfortable,"
13080,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","my husband and me just in the nine holes, when all of a sudden there"
13081,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","was a fall of something and a scream. Up jumps Mr. D. of course,"
13082,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","chucking his cards here, there, and every where, and calling a blow! a"
13083,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",blow!--and as usual Emily and Lucy and Eliza and me rushed off to the
13084,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","coal-cellar, while Mrs. T. went into a fit. It is true, by the blessing"
13085,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","of Providence, it was only the Housemaid letting her pail fall to"
13086,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","screech at a bat; but what is very disagreeable, the Trotters are old"
13087,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","friends, and have declined to set another foot within our doors. As for"
13088,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","servants, it is next to impossible to keep one about me; and as Your"
13089,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","Lordship’s own Lady will confirm, there is nothing more unpleasant to"
13090,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",a Mistress of a House than to be continually changing. But nine out
13091,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","of ten prefer giving warning, to attending to so many punctiliums as"
13092,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","are laid down; and those that are willing to stay, break through so"
13093,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","many of the rules, that I am obliged to discharge them, to prevent Mr."
13094,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",D. being ruffled by doing it himself. Besides it adds considerably to
13095,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","servants’ work, to have chimneys swept so often as once a week,--and"
13096,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","moreover, Mr. D. insists on keeping all flints and steels, and tinder,"
13097,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","and matches, in his own bed-room, so that the housemaid has to go"
13098,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",to him every morning for her lights. He is just as particular about
13099,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","extinguishing at night; and I lost the best cook I ever had, through"
13100,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","her sitting up in her bed-room to mend her stays, though she might have"
13101,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",known Mr. D. would come in to put her out--all of which is extremely
13102,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","unpleasant, and to me in particular."

13109,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",them to take of their own lives; and make no secret of wanting his
13110,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","removal, by trying to torment him into resignation. Not a day passes"
13111,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","without squabbles about smoking, for Mr. D. is apt to sniff tobacco,"
13112,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","and insists on searching pockets for pipes, which the labourers one and"
13113,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","all decline; and besides scuffles, there have been several pay offs on"
13114,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","the spot. The consequence is ill will and bad blood to their superior,"
13115,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",and it is become a standing practical joke to play upon the family
13116,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",feelings and fears. I have twice suffered all the disagreeables of
13117,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","escaping from nothing at all in my night dress, exposed to rheumatism,"
13118,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",and the natives of a low neighbourhood; indeed only last Sunday the
13119,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","fire bell was rung by nobody, and no wind at all to speak of. Another"
13120,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",party at enmity is Doctor Worral and all his establishment; because Mr.
13121,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","D. felt it his public duty to have the Doctor up before a Justice, for"
13122,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",allowing his Young Gentlemen to send up fire-balloons. We had one day
13123,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","of dreadful excitement on my husband’s part, through a wicked little"
13124,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",wretch of a pupil flashing the sunshine into the Mill with a bit of
13125,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",looking-glass; and of course we are indebted for the Swing letters we
13126,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","receive to the same juvenile quarters. To make bad worse, Mr. D. takes"
13127,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","them all for Gospel, and the extra watchings, and patrollings, and"
13128,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","precautions, after getting a threatening notice, are enough to wear"
13129,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","out all our hearts. As regards the School, I am ready to agree that it"
13130,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","is too near the Works; and to tell the truth, I shake in my shoes as"
13131,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","much as Mr. D., every fifth of November, at each squib and cracker that"
13132,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",goes off. On the same score our own sons are an everlasting misery to
13133,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","us when they are at home; which they seldom are, poor fellows, on that"
13134,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",account. But if there is one thing above another that boys delight
13135,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","to play with, it is gunpowder; and being at the very fountainhead,"
13136,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",Your Lordship may conceive the constant care it is to prevent their
13137,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","getting at it, and what is worse, not always crowned with success."
13138,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",Indeed even more innocent playthings are obliged to be guarded against;
13139,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","for as their father says, “a little brat, just breeched, may strike"
13140,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","light enough to blow up a whole neighbourhood, through only spinning a"
13141,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",peg-tog in a paved yard.”
13142,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",
13143,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","Such, your Lordship, is our present melancholy state. I have not dwelt,"
13144,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","as I might do, on expenses, such as the dresses that are spoiled in"
13145,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",the coal-cellar; the paying months’ wages instead of warnings; nor
13146,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","the trays upon trays of glass and china that are chucked down, as the"
13147,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",way the servants always empty their hands when making their escapes
13148,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",from my husband’s false alarms. Sometimes it’s a chair falls overhead;
13149,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",or the wind slams the back door; or a smell of burnt wood from the
13150,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",kitchen; or the ironing-blanket; or fat catched; or fall of soot; or
13151,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","a candle-snuff; or a smoky coal; or, as I have known before now, only"
13152,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",the smell of the drains; with a hundred other little things that will
13153,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","spring up in families, take what care you will. I ought not to forget"
13154,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","thunder-storms, which are another source of trouble; for, besides"
13155,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","seeing a dozen fanciful flashes for one real one, it is the misfortune"
13156,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","of Mr. D. not to put faith in conductors, or, to use his own words, “in"
13157,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","Franklin, philosophy, and fiddlesticks,--and a birch rod as likely to"
13158,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","frighten away lightning as an iron one.” In the meantime, through the"
13159,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","constant frights and flurries, I begin to find my own nerves infected"
13160,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","by bad example, and getting into startlish habits; and my daughter"
13161,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","Lucy, who was always delicate, seems actually going into a poor low"
13162,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",way. Agreeable society might do much to enliven our spirits; but my
13163,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","husband is become very shy of visitors, ever since Captain Gower was so"
13164,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","inconsiderate as to walk in, one foggy night, with a lighted cigar in"
13165,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","his mouth. In fact he quite sets his face against the male sex: for, if"
13166,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","they do not smoke cigars, he says, and carry lucifers, they strut on"
13167,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",their iron heels and flourish about with iron-pointed walking-sticks
13168,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","and umbrellas. All which, Your Lordship, is extremely hard on myself"
13169,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","and daughters, who, like all young people, are fond of a little gaiety;"
13170,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","but the very utmost they are allowed, is a single quadrille party at"
13171,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","Christmas, and then they are all obliged to dance in list shoes."
13172,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",
13173,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",[Illustration: A SET-OFF IN ACCOUNT.]
13174,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",
13175,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","I humbly trust to Your Lordship’s liberality, and goodness of heart, to"
13176,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",view the particulars of the above melancholy statement with attentive
13177,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",consideration. As it may occur to inquire how we have suffered so
13178,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","long without complaining, I beg to inform Your Lordship, that, being"
13179,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","such a time of profound peace, we have lived on from year to year in"
13180,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",the hope that no more ammunition would be required; and consequently
13181,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",the place would become a comfortable sinecure. But it appears that
13182,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","Spain and Portugal, and other countries, have gone to war on condition"
13183,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","of being supplied with gunpowder; and accordingly, to our bitter"
13184,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","disappointment, the works are as vigorous as ever. Your Lordship will"
13185,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",admit the hardship of such a cruel position to a man of Mr. D.’s very
13186,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",peculiar constitution; and I do hope and trust will also regard his
13187,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","interests with a favourable eye, in consideration of his long-standing"
13188,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","claims upon the country. What his friends most desire for him is, some"
13189,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","official situation,--of course with a sufficient income to support"
13190,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","his consequence, and a numerous family,--but without any business"
13191,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","attached to it, or only as much as might help to amuse his mind for"
13192,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","one or two hours in the day. Such a removal, considering my husband’s"
13193,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","unfitness for anything else, could occasion no sort of injury to the"
13194,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",public service; particularly as his vacancy would be so easy to fill
13195,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",up. There are hundreds and thousands of land and sea officers on
13196,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","half pay, who have been used to popping, and banging, and blowing up"
13197,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","rockets and bomb-shells, all their lives; and would, therefore, not"
13198,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","object to the Powder Mills; especially as the salary is handsome, with"
13199,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","a rent-free house and garden, coal and candles, and all the other"
13200,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",little perquisites that belong to public posts. As regards ourselves
13201,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","on the contrary, any interest is preferable to the gunpowder interest;"
13202,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","and I take upon myself to say, that Mr. D. would be most proud and"
13203,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",happy to receive any favour from Your Lordship’s administration; as
13204,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","well as answering for his pursuing any line of political principles,"
13205,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","conservative or unconservative, that might be chalked out. Any such act"
13206,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","of patronage would command the eternal gratitude of Mr. D., self, and"
13207,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,","family; and, repeating a thousand apologies for thus addressing, I beg"
13208,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",leave to remain
13209,"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,",

13239,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"concern, especially--a daring, glaring, flaring, gin-palace-like"

13241,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"heady, very unrectified article, should obtain any custom whatever,"
13242,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"in a reputed genteel and well-lighted neighbourhood, seems quite"
13243,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,impossible; yet such is the incomprehensible fact;--respectable
13244,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"parties, scientific men, and even physicians, in good practice in"
13245,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"all other respects, have notoriously frequented the bar, from which"
13246,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"they have issued again, walking all sorts of ways at once, or more"
13247,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"frequently falling asleep on the steps, but still talking such"
13248,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,“rambling skimble-skamble stuff” as would naturally be suggested by
13249,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"the incoherent visions of a drunken man. Such exhibitions, however are"
13250,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"comparatively rare in London to their occurrence in Paris, which city"
13251,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,has always taken the lead of our own capital in matters of novelty.
13252,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"It is asserted by a good authority, that at a French concern, in the"
13253,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"same line, no less than seventy-eight “medical men, and sixty-three"
13254,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"other very intelligent individuals,” became thoroughly muzzy and"
13255,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"mystified, and so completely lost all “_clairvoyance_” of their own,"
13256,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,that they applied to an individual to read a book and a letter to
13257,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,them; to tell them the hour on their own watches; to mention the pips
13258,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,on the cards; and by way of putting the state of their “intuitive
13259,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"foresight” beyond question, they actually appealed to the _back_sight"
13260,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,of a man who was sound asleep! A bout on so large a scale has not been
13261,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"attempted, hitherto, in the English metropolis; but as all fashions"
13262,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"transplanted from Paris flourish vigorously in our soil, it is not"
13263,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,improbable that we may yet see a Meeting of the College of Physicians
13264,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,rendered very how-come-you-so indeed by an excess of Mesmer’s
13265,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,“particular.” The influence of such an example could not fail to have
13266,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,a powerful influence on all classes; and a pernicious narcotic would
13267,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,come into general use; the notorious effect of which is to undermine
13268,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"the reason of its votaries, and rob them of their common senses. To"
13269,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"avert such a national evil, surely demands the timely efforts of"
13270,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"our philanthropists; and above all, of those persons who have set"
13271,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"their faces against the Old Tom--not of Lincoln, but of London--and"
13272,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"in their zeal for the public sobriety, aim at even converting the"
13273,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"brewers’ kilderkins into pumpkins.--Seriously, might not the Temperance"
13274,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"Societies extend the sphere of their operations by a whole hemisphere,"
13275,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"and perhaps with equal advantage to mankind, by attacking mental"
13276,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"dram-drinking, as well as the bodily tippling of ardent spirits? The"
13277,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"bewildered rollings, reelings, and idiotic effusions of mere animal"
13278,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"drunkenness can hardly be more degrading to rational human beings,"
13279,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"than the crazy toddlings and twaddlings of a bemused mind, whether"
13280,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"only maudlin with infinitesimal doses of quackery, or rampant to mad"
13281,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,staggers with the _lush_ious compounds and Devil’s Elixirs of the
13282,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"Mesmerian Distillery. Take the wildest freaks of the most fuddled,"

13284,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"a pump,”--attempting to wind up a plug with his watch-key,--or"

13286,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"they a bit, or a whit, or a jot, or a what-not, more absurd, more"
13287,ANIMAL MAGNETISM.,"extravagant, or more indicative of imbecility of reason, than the"

13341,"DEAR UNCLE,",
13342,"DEAR UNCLE,",I was agreeably surprised by your breaking silence; for I had made up
13343,"DEAR UNCLE,",my mind you was a distrest farmer gone off swan hopping (excuse the
13344,"DEAR UNCLE,","joke) to Swan River, or to get settled among the Dutch boars and lions"
13345,"DEAR UNCLE,",at the Cape of Good Hope. Thank heaven such is not the case; though
13346,"DEAR UNCLE,","damped with my dear aunt’s going off. I little thought, poor soul! the"
13347,"DEAR UNCLE,",why and wherefore my goose three Christmases ago was the last! But we
13348,"DEAR UNCLE,","must all be cut off some day or other, which is a religious consolation"

13351,"DEAR UNCLE,",[Illustration: SWAN-HOPPING.]
13352,"DEAR UNCLE,",
13353,"DEAR UNCLE,","I have examined, as you desired, a sample of animal magnetism; which"
13354,"DEAR UNCLE,",turns out to be the reverse of every thing you expect. Indeed such
13355,"DEAR UNCLE,",might have been anticipated by a little forethought on the subject.
13356,"DEAR UNCLE,","There is nothing to describe about animals to such as you, that deal"
13357,"DEAR UNCLE,",in them of all qualities; but it is quite likely that you have forgot
13358,"DEAR UNCLE,","all about magnets, since the days of your youth. But perhaps, when"
13359,"DEAR UNCLE,","they are named to you, your memory may serve to recollect little bone"
13360,"DEAR UNCLE,","boxes, at sixpence a piece, with a blackamoor’s head atop, and a"
13361,"DEAR UNCLE,","little bar of philosopher’s steel inside, that points out the north,"
13362,"DEAR UNCLE,","and sets a needle dancing like mad. It likewise picks up emery, and"
13363,"DEAR UNCLE,",sticks fast to the blade of a knife. But that is all its powers are
13364,"DEAR UNCLE,","competent to--and of course on too small a scale to have any dancing,"
13365,"DEAR UNCLE,","or lifting, or sticking effect on objects so big as bullocks, or even"
13366,"DEAR UNCLE,","a pig, or a sheep. Accordingly, you will not be surprised to hear that"
13367,"DEAR UNCLE,",animal magnetism has nothing at all to do with beasts or load-stones
13368,"DEAR UNCLE,","either, but is all of a piece with juggling, quacksalving, and"
13369,"DEAR UNCLE,","mountebanking, such as universal physic, spitting Coventry ribbons,"
13370,"DEAR UNCLE,","tumbling, and posturing, thimble-rig, and the like fabrics. One of the"
13371,"DEAR UNCLE,",principal tricks is sending people off to sleep against their wills;
13372,"DEAR UNCLE,","not so new a trick though, but it has been heard of years and years"
13373,"DEAR UNCLE,","ago at Bow Street; and easy enough to perform any day, with a pint of"
13374,"DEAR UNCLE,","porter,--provided one was rogue enough to want to hocus-pocus the money"
13375,"DEAR UNCLE,","out of other people’s pockets into one’s own. To come to the point,"
13376,"DEAR UNCLE,",there’s an outlandish Count set up in it at the west end; and no doubt
13377,"DEAR UNCLE,","will realise a fortune. He has his carriage-people for customers, as"
13378,"DEAR UNCLE,","well as Howel and James; indeed, I have heard of the Somebodies as well"
13379,"DEAR UNCLE,","as Nobodies running after common fortune-tellers’ tales, and not too"
13380,"DEAR UNCLE,",high to be above going up into their back garrets. Some say he is a
13381,"DEAR UNCLE,","Frenchman, others say a German; but the last for choice, for he smokes"
13382,"DEAR UNCLE,","enough to drive all the rats out of the neighbourhood. Besides, the"
13383,"DEAR UNCLE,","Germans, I’m told, will believe anything, provided it’s impossible;"
13384,"DEAR UNCLE,",which is some excuse for their wanting other people to give the same
13385,"DEAR UNCLE,","long credits; and besides, Germans as well as French, and indeed all"
13386,"DEAR UNCLE,","other foreigners, for that matter, though ever such honest people in"
13387,"DEAR UNCLE,","the main; yet when they _do_ turn rogues at English expense, they"
13388,"DEAR UNCLE,","invariably go more than the whole hog, namely, boar, sow, sucking"
13389,"DEAR UNCLE,","pigs and all. So I determined to go wide awake, and to keep my eyes"
13390,"DEAR UNCLE,","open, too, by not taking bit or sup in the house, if offered ever"
13391,"DEAR UNCLE,","so politely. It is surely not showing disrespect to hospitality, to"
13392,"DEAR UNCLE,","object to hocussed victuals and drinks. I might have spared my fears,"
13393,"DEAR UNCLE,","however; for there was nothing provided but the ledgerdemain, &c., and"
13394,"DEAR UNCLE,","that was charged a guinea for, which you can repay at convenience. I"
13395,"DEAR UNCLE,",preferred to see somebody else conjured before me; so another patient
13396,"DEAR UNCLE,","was taken first. She was a fine strapping young woman enough, dressed"
13397,"DEAR UNCLE,",half and half between a fine lady and a servantmaid; but as sly-looking
13398,"DEAR UNCLE,",a baggage as you could select from an assortment of gypseys; and unless
13399,"DEAR UNCLE,","her face belied her, quite capable of scratching a Cock Lane ghost."
13400,"DEAR UNCLE,",Indeed something came across me that I had seen her before; and if
13401,"DEAR UNCLE,","memory don’t deceive, it was at some private theatricals contrary to"
