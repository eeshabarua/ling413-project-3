67,L'ENVOI,
68,L'ENVOI,
69,L'ENVOI,Mongst the many young men in England who are seeking along with me to
70,L'ENVOI,continue and to perfect the English Renaissance--_jeunes guerriers du
71,L'ENVOI,"drapeau romantique_, as Gautier would have called us--there is none"
72,L'ENVOI,"whose love of art is more flawless and fervent, whose artistic sense of"
73,L'ENVOI,"beauty is more subtle and more delicate--none, indeed, who is dearer to"
74,L'ENVOI,myself--than the young poet whose verses I have brought with me to
75,L'ENVOI,"America; verses full of sweet sadness, and yet full of joy; for the most"
76,L'ENVOI,joyous poet is not he who sows the desolate highways of this world with
77,L'ENVOI,"the barren seed of laughter, but he who makes his sorrow most musical,"
78,L'ENVOI,this indeed being the meaning of joy in art--that incommunicable element
79,L'ENVOI,"of artistic delight which, in poetry, for instance, comes from what"
80,L'ENVOI,"Keats called the ""sensuous life of verse,"" the element of song in the"
81,L'ENVOI,"singing, made so pleasurable to us by that wonder of motion which often"
82,L'ENVOI,"has its origin in mere musical impulse, and in painting is to be sought"
83,L'ENVOI,"for, from the subject never, but from the pictorial charm only--the"
84,L'ENVOI,"scheme and symphony of the colour, the satisfying beauty of the design:"
85,L'ENVOI,so that the ultimate expression of our artistic movement in painting has
86,L'ENVOI,"been, not in the spiritual visions of the pre-Raphaelites, for all their"
87,L'ENVOI,"marvel of Greek legend and their mystery of Italian song, but in the"
88,L'ENVOI,"work of such men as Whistler and Albert Moore, who have raised design"
89,L'ENVOI,and colour to the ideal level of poetry and music. For the quality of
90,L'ENVOI,their exquisite painting comes from the mere inventive and creative
91,L'ENVOI,"handling of lime and colour, from a certain form and choice of beautiful"
92,L'ENVOI,"workmanship, which, rejecting all literary reminiscence and all"
93,L'ENVOI,"metaphysical idea, is in itself entirely satisfying to the æsthetic"
94,L'ENVOI,"sense--is, as the Greeks would say, an end in itself; the effect of"
95,L'ENVOI,their work being like the effect given to us by music; for music is the
96,L'ENVOI,art in which form and matter are always one--the art whose subject
97,L'ENVOI,cannot be separated from the method of its expression; the art which
98,L'ENVOI,"most completely realises for us the artistic ideal, and is the condition"
99,L'ENVOI,to which all the other arts are constantly aspiring.
100,L'ENVOI,
101,L'ENVOI,"Now, this increased sense of the absolutely satisfying value of"
102,L'ENVOI,"beautiful workmanship, this recognition of the primary importance of the"
103,L'ENVOI,"sensuous element in art, this love of art for art's sake, is the point"
104,L'ENVOI,in which we of the younger school have made a departure from the
105,L'ENVOI,"teaching of Mr. Ruskin,--a departure definite and different and"
106,L'ENVOI,decisive.
107,L'ENVOI,
108,L'ENVOI,Master indeed of the knowledge of all noble living and of the wisdom of
109,L'ENVOI,"all spiritual things will he be to us ever, seeing that it was he who by"
110,L'ENVOI,the magic of his presence and the music of his lips taught us at Oxford
111,L'ENVOI,"that enthusiasm for beauty which is the secret of Hellenism, and that"
112,L'ENVOI,"desire for creation which is the secret of life, and filled some of us,"
113,L'ENVOI,"at least, with the lofty and passionate ambition to go forth into far"
114,L'ENVOI,and fair lands with some message for the nations and some mission for
115,L'ENVOI,"the world, and yet in his art criticism, his estimate of the joyous"
116,L'ENVOI,"element of art, his whole method of approaching art, we are no longer"
117,L'ENVOI,with him; for the keystone to his æsthetic system is ethical always. He
118,L'ENVOI,would judge of a picture by the amount of noble moral ideas it
119,L'ENVOI,expresses; but to us the channels by which all noble work in painting
120,L'ENVOI,"can touch, and does touch, the soul are not those of truths of life or"
121,L'ENVOI,metaphysical truths. To him perfection of workmanship seems but the
122,L'ENVOI,"symbol of pride, and incompleteness of technical resource the image of"
123,L'ENVOI,an imagination too limitless to find within the limits of form its
124,L'ENVOI,"complete expression, or of a love too simple not to stammer in its tale."
125,L'ENVOI,But to us the rule of art is not the rule of morals. In an ethical
126,L'ENVOI,"system, indeed, of any gentle mercy good intentions will, one is fain to"
127,L'ENVOI,"fancy, have their recognition; but of those that would enter the serene"
128,L'ENVOI,House of Beauty the question that we ask is not what they had ever
129,L'ENVOI,"meant to do, but what they have done. Their pathetic intentions are of"
130,L'ENVOI,"no value to us, but their realised creations only. _Pour moi je préfère"
131,L'ENVOI,"les poètes qui font des vers, les médecins qui sachent guérir, les"
132,L'ENVOI,peintres qui sachent peindre._
133,L'ENVOI,
134,L'ENVOI,"Nor, in looking at a work of art, should we be dreaming of what it"
135,L'ENVOI,"symbolises, but rather loving it for what it is. Indeed, the"
136,L'ENVOI,transcendental spirit is alien to the spirit of art. The metaphysical
137,L'ENVOI,"mind of Asia may create for itself the monstrous and many-breasted idol,"
138,L'ENVOI,"but to the Greek, pure artist, that work is most instinct with spiritual"
139,L'ENVOI,life which conforms most closely to the perfect facts of physical life
140,L'ENVOI,"also. Nor, in its primary aspect, has a painting, for instance, any more"
141,L'ENVOI,spiritual message or meaning for us than a blue tile from the wall of
142,L'ENVOI,"Damascus, or a Hitzen vase. It is a beautifully-coloured surface,"
143,L'ENVOI,"nothing more, and affects us by no suggestion stolen from philosophy, no"
144,L'ENVOI,"pathos pilfered from literature, no feeling filched from a poet, but by"
145,L'ENVOI,its own incommunicable artistic essence--by that selection of truth
146,L'ENVOI,"which we call style, and that relation of values which is the"
147,L'ENVOI,"draughtsmanship of painting, by the whole quality of the workmanship,"
148,L'ENVOI,"the arabesque of the design, the splendour of the colour, for these"
149,L'ENVOI,things are enough to stir the most divine and remote of the chords which
150,L'ENVOI,"make music in our soul, and colour, indeed, is of itself a mystical"
151,L'ENVOI,"presence on things, and tone a kind of sentiment."
152,L'ENVOI,
153,L'ENVOI,"This, then--the new departure of our younger school--is the chief"
154,L'ENVOI,"characteristic of Mr. Rennell Rodd's poetry; for, while there is much in"
155,L'ENVOI,"his work that may interest the intellect, much that will excite the"
156,L'ENVOI,"emotions, and many cadenced chords of sweet and simple sentiment--for to"
157,L'ENVOI,those who love Art for its own sake all other things are added--yet the
158,L'ENVOI,effect which they preëminently seek to produce is purely an artistic
159,L'ENVOI,"one. Such a poem as ""The Sea-King's Grave,"" with all its majesty of"
160,L'ENVOI,melody as sonorous and as strong as the sea by whose pine-fringed
161,L'ENVOI,shores it was thus nobly conceived and nobly fashioned; or the little
162,L'ENVOI,"poem that follows it, whose cunning workmanship, wrought with such an"
163,L'ENVOI,"artistic sense of limitation, one might liken to the rare chasing of the"
164,L'ENVOI,"mirror that is its motive; or ""In a Church,"" pale flower of one of those"
165,L'ENVOI,exquisite moments when all things except the moment itself seem so
166,L'ENVOI,"curiously real, and when the old memories of forgotten days are touched"
167,L'ENVOI,"and made tender, and the familiar place grows fervent and solemn"
168,L'ENVOI,suddenly with a vision of the undying beauty of the gods that died; or
169,L'ENVOI,"the scene in ""Chartres Cathedral,"" sombre silence brooding on vault and"
170,L'ENVOI,"arch, silent people kneeling on the dust of the desolate pavement as the"
171,L'ENVOI,"young priest lifts Lord Christ's body in a crystal star, and then the"
172,L'ENVOI,sudden beams of scarlet light that break through the blazoned window and
173,L'ENVOI,"smite on the carven screen, and sudden organ peals of mighty music"
174,L'ENVOI,"rolling and echoing from choir to canopy, and from spire to shaft, and"
175,L'ENVOI,"over all the clear glad voice of a singing boy, affecting one as a"
176,L'ENVOI,"thing oversweet, and striking just the right artistic keynote for one's"
177,L'ENVOI,"emotions; or ""At Lanuvium"", through the music of whose lines one seems"
178,L'ENVOI,to hear again the murmur of the Mantuan bees straying down from their
179,L'ENVOI,own green valleys and inland streams to find what honeyed amber the
180,L'ENVOI,"sea-flowers might be hiding; or the poem written ""In the Coliseum,"""
181,L'ENVOI,which gives one the same artistic joy that one gets watching a
182,L'ENVOI,"handicraftsman at his work, a goldsmith hammering out his gold into"
183,L'ENVOI,"those thin plates as delicate as the petals of a yellow rose, or drawing"
184,L'ENVOI,"it out into the long wires like tangled sunbeams, so perfect and"
185,L'ENVOI,precious is the mere handling of it; or the little lyric interludes that
186,L'ENVOI,"break in here and there like the singing of a thrush, and are as swift"
187,L'ENVOI,"and as sure as the beating of a bird's wing, as light and bright as the"
188,L'ENVOI,apple-blossoms that flutter fitfully down to the orchard grass after a
189,L'ENVOI,"spring shower, and look the lovelier for the rain's tears lying on"
190,L'ENVOI,their dainty veinings of pink and pearl; or the sonnets--for Mr. Rodd
191,L'ENVOI,"is one of those _qui sonnent le sonnet_, as the Ronsardists used to"
192,L'ENVOI,"say--that one called ""On the Border Hills,"" with its fiery wonder of"
193,L'ENVOI,imagination and the strange beauty of its eighth line; or the one which
194,L'ENVOI,"tells of the sorrow of the great king for the little dead child,--well,"
195,L'ENVOI,"all these poems aim, as I said, at producing a purely artistic effect,"
196,L'ENVOI,and have the rare and exquisite quality that belongs to work of that
197,L'ENVOI,kind; and I feel that the entire subordination in our æsthetic movement
198,L'ENVOI,of all merely emotional and intellectual motives to the vital informing
199,L'ENVOI,poetic principle is the surest sign of our strength.
200,L'ENVOI,
201,L'ENVOI,But it is not enough that a work of art should conform to the æsthetic
202,L'ENVOI,"demands of the age: there should be also about it, if it is to give us"
203,L'ENVOI,"any permanent delight, the impress of a distinct individuality. Whatever"
204,L'ENVOI,work we have in the nineteenth century must rest on the two poles of
205,L'ENVOI,"personality and perfection. And so in this little volume, by separating"
206,L'ENVOI,the earlier and more simple work from the work that is later and
207,L'ENVOI,stronger and possesses increased technical power and more artistic
208,L'ENVOI,"vision, one might weave these disconnected poems, these stray and"
209,L'ENVOI,"scattered threads, into one fiery-coloured strand of life, noting first"
210,L'ENVOI,"a boy's mere gladness of being young, with all its simple joy in field"
211,L'ENVOI,"and flower, in sunlight and in song, and then the bitterness of sudden"
212,L'ENVOI,sorrow at the ending by Death of one of the brief and beautiful
213,L'ENVOI,"friendships of one's youth, with all those unanswered longings and"
214,L'ENVOI,"questionings unsatisfied by which we vex, so uselessly, the marble face"
215,L'ENVOI,of death; the artistic contrast between the discontented incompleteness
216,L'ENVOI,of the spirit and the complete perfection of the style that expresses it
217,L'ENVOI,forming the chief element of the æsthetic charm of these particular
218,L'ENVOI,"poems;--and then the birth of Love, and all the wonder and the fear and"
219,L'ENVOI,the perilous delight of one on whose boyish brows the little wings of
220,L'ENVOI,"love have beaten for the first time; and the love-songs, so dainty and"
221,L'ENVOI,"delicate, little swallow-flights of music, and full of such fragrance"
222,L'ENVOI,and freedom that they might all be sung in the open air and across
223,L'ENVOI,"moving water; and then autumn, coming with its quireless woods and"
224,L'ENVOI,"odorous decay and ruined loveliness, Love lying dead; and the sense of"
225,L'ENVOI,the mere pity of it.
226,L'ENVOI,
227,L'ENVOI,"One might stop there, for from a young poet one should ask for no deeper"
228,L'ENVOI,chords of life than those that love and friendship make eternal for us;
229,L'ENVOI,"and the best poems in this volume belong clearly to a later time, a time"
230,L'ENVOI,when these real experiences become absorbed and gathered up into a form
231,L'ENVOI,which seems from such real experiences to be the most alien and the most
232,L'ENVOI,"remote; when the simple expression of joy or sorrow suffices no longer,"
233,L'ENVOI,"and lives rather in the stateliness of the cadenced metre, in the music"
234,L'ENVOI,"and colour of the linked words, than in any direct utterance; lives, one"
235,L'ENVOI,"might say, in the perfection of the form more than in the pathos of the"
236,L'ENVOI,"feeling. And yet, after the broken music of love and the burial of love"
237,L'ENVOI,"in the autumn woods, we can trace that wandering among strange people,"
238,L'ENVOI,"and in lands unknown to us, by which we try so pathetically to heal the"
239,L'ENVOI,"hurts of the life we know, and that pure and passionate devotion to Art"
240,L'ENVOI,which one gets when the harsh reality of life has too suddenly wounded
241,L'ENVOI,"one, and is with discontent or sorrow marring one's youth, just as"
242,L'ENVOI,"often, I think, as one gets it from any natural joy of living; and that"
243,L'ENVOI,"curious intensity of vision by which, in moments of over-mastering"
244,L'ENVOI,"sadness and despair ungovernable, artistic things will live in one's"
245,L'ENVOI,memory with a vivid realism caught from the life which they help one to
246,L'ENVOI,"forget--an old gray tomb in Flanders with a strange legend on it, making"
247,L'ENVOI,"one think how, perhaps, passion does live on after death, a necklace of"
248,L'ENVOI,blue and amber beads and a broken mirror found in a girl's grave at
249,L'ENVOI,"Rome, a marble image of a boy habited like Erôs, and with the pathetic"
250,L'ENVOI,tradition of a great king's sorrow lingering about it like a purple
251,L'ENVOI,"shadow,--over all these the tired spirit broods with that calm and"
252,L'ENVOI,certain joy that one gets when one has found something that the ages
253,L'ENVOI,never dull and the world cannot harm; and with it comes that desire of
254,L'ENVOI,Greek things which is often an artistic method of expressing one's
255,L'ENVOI,desire for perfection; and that longing for the old dead days which is
256,L'ENVOI,"so modern, so incomplete, so touching, being, in a way, the inverted"
257,L'ENVOI,"torch of Hope, which burns the hand it should guide; and for many things"
258,L'ENVOI,"a little sadness, and for all things a great love; and lastly, in the"
259,L'ENVOI,"pine-wood by the sea, once more the quick and vital pulse of joyous"
260,L'ENVOI,"youth leaping and laughing in every line, the frank and fearless freedom"
261,L'ENVOI,of wave and wind waking into fire life's burnt-out ashes and into song
262,L'ENVOI,"the silent lips of pain,--how clearly one seems to see it all, the long"
263,L'ENVOI,colonnade of pines with sea and sky peeping in here and there like a
264,L'ENVOI,flitting of silver; the open place in the green deep heart of the wood
265,L'ENVOI,with the little moss-grown altar to the old Italian god in it; and the
266,L'ENVOI,"flowers all about, cyclamen in the shadowy places, and the stars of the"
267,L'ENVOI,"white narcissus lying like snowflakes over the grass, where the quick,"
268,L'ENVOI,"bright-eyed lizard starts by the stone, and the snake lies coiled lazily"
269,L'ENVOI,"in the sun on the hot sand, and overhead the gossamer floats from the"
270,L'ENVOI,"branches like thin tremulous threads of gold,--the scene is so perfect"
271,L'ENVOI,"for its motive, for surely here, if anywhere, the real gladness of life"
272,L'ENVOI,"might be revealed to one's youth--the gladness that comes, not from the"
273,L'ENVOI,"rejection, but from the absorption, of all passion, and is like that"
274,L'ENVOI,"serene calm that dwells in the faces of the Greek statues, and which"
275,L'ENVOI,"despair and sorrow cannot disturb, but intensify only."
276,L'ENVOI,
277,L'ENVOI,In some such way as this we could gather up these strewn and scattered
278,L'ENVOI,"petals of song into one perfect rose of life, and yet, perhaps, in so"
279,L'ENVOI,"doing, we might be missing the true quality of the poems; one's real"
280,L'ENVOI,"life is so often the life that one does not lead; and beautiful poems,"
281,L'ENVOI,"like threads of beautiful silks, may be woven into many patterns and to"
282,L'ENVOI,"suit many designs, all wonderful and all different: and romantic poetry,"
283,L'ENVOI,"too, is essentially the poetry of impressions, being like that latest"
284,L'ENVOI,"school of painting, the school of Whistler and Albert Moore, in its"
285,L'ENVOI,choice of situation as opposed to subject; in its dealing with the
286,L'ENVOI,exceptions rather than with the types of life; in its brief intensity;
287,L'ENVOI,"in what one might call its fiery-coloured momentariness, it being indeed"
288,L'ENVOI,"the momentary situations of life, the momentary aspects of nature, which"
289,L'ENVOI,poetry and painting now seek to render for us. Sincerity and constancy
290,L'ENVOI,"will the artist, indeed, have always; but sincerity in art is merely"
291,L'ENVOI,"that plastic perfection of execution without which a poem or a painting,"
292,L'ENVOI,"however noble its sentiment or human its origin, is but wasted and"
293,L'ENVOI,"unreal work, and the constancy of the artist cannot be to any definite"
294,L'ENVOI,"rule or system of living, but to that principle of beauty only through"
295,L'ENVOI,which the inconstant shadows of his life are in their most fleeting
296,L'ENVOI,"moment arrested and made permanent. He will not, for instance, in"
297,L'ENVOI,"intellectual matters, acquiesce in that facile orthodoxy of our day"
298,L'ENVOI,"which is so reasonable and so artistically uninteresting, nor yet will"
299,L'ENVOI,"he desire that fiery faith of the antique time which, while it"
300,L'ENVOI,"intensified, yet limited, the vision, still less will he allow the calm"
301,L'ENVOI,of his culture to be marred by the discordant despair of doubt or the
302,L'ENVOI,"sadness of a sterile skepticism; for the Valley Perilous, where ignorant"
303,L'ENVOI,"armies clash by night, is no resting-place meet for her to whom the gods"
304,L'ENVOI,"have assigned the clear upland, the serene height, and the sunlit"
305,L'ENVOI,"air,--rather will he be always curiously testing new forms of belief,"
306,L'ENVOI,tinging his nature with the sentiment that still lingers about some
307,L'ENVOI,"beautiful creeds, and searching for experience itself, and not for the"
308,L'ENVOI,"fruits of experience, when he has got its secret, he will leave without"
309,L'ENVOI,"regret much that was once very precious to him. ""I am always insincere,"""
310,L'ENVOI,"says Emerson somewhere, ""as knowing that there are other moods:"" ""_Les"
311,L'ENVOI,"émotions_,"" wrote Théophile Gautier once in a review of Arsène"
312,L'ENVOI,"Houssaye, ""_Les émotions ne se ressemblent pas, mais être ému--voilà"
313,L'ENVOI,"l'important_""."
314,L'ENVOI,
315,L'ENVOI,"Now, this is the secret of the art of the modern romantic school, and"
316,L'ENVOI,gives one the right keynote for its apprehension; but the real quality
317,L'ENVOI,"of all work which, like Mr. Rodd's, aims, as I said, at a purely"
318,L'ENVOI,"artistic effect, cannot be described in terms of intellectual criticism;"
319,L'ENVOI,it is too intangible for that. One can perhaps convey it best in terms
320,L'ENVOI,"of the other arts, and by reference to them; and, indeed, some of these"
321,L'ENVOI,poems are as iridescent and as exquisite as a lovely fragment of
322,L'ENVOI,Venetian glass; others as delicate in perfect workmanship and as simple
323,L'ENVOI,"in natural motive as an etching by Whistler is, or one of those"
324,L'ENVOI,beautiful little Greek figures which in the olive woods round Tanagra
325,L'ENVOI,"men can still find, with the faint gilding and the fading crimson not"
326,L'ENVOI,yet fled from hair and lips and raiment; and many of them seem like one
327,L'ENVOI,"of Corot's twilights just passing into music, for not merely in visible"
328,L'ENVOI,"colour, but in sentiment also--which is the colour of poetry--may there"
329,L'ENVOI,be a kind of tone.
330,L'ENVOI,
331,L'ENVOI,But I think that the best likeness to the quality of this young poet's
332,L'ENVOI,"work I ever saw was in the landscape by the Loire. We were staying once,"
333,L'ENVOI,"he and I, at Amboise, that little village with its gray-slate roofs and"
334,L'ENVOI,"steep streets and gaunt grim gateway, where the quiet cottages nestle"
335,L'ENVOI,"like white pigeons into the sombre clefts of the great bastioned rock,"
336,L'ENVOI,and the stately Renaissance houses stand silent and apart--very desolate
337,L'ENVOI,"now, but with some memory of the old days still lingering about the"
338,L'ENVOI,"delicately-twisted pillars, and the carved doorways, with their"
339,L'ENVOI,"grotesque animals, and laughing masks, and quaint heraldic devices, all"
340,L'ENVOI,reminding one of a people who could not think life real till they had
341,L'ENVOI,"made it fantastic. And above the village, and beyond the bend of the"
342,L'ENVOI,"river, we used to go in the afternoon, and sketch from one of the big"
343,L'ENVOI,barges that bring the wine in autumn and the wood in winter down to the
344,L'ENVOI,"sea, or lie in the long grass and make plans _pour la gloire, et pour"
345,L'ENVOI,"ennuyer les philistins_, or wander along the low sedgy banks, ""matching"
346,L'ENVOI,"our reeds in sportive rivalry,"" as comrades used in the old Sicilian"
347,L'ENVOI,"days; and the land was an ordinary land enough, and bare too when one"
348,L'ENVOI,"thought of Italy, and how the oleanders were robing the hillsides by"
349,L'ENVOI,"Genoa in scarlet, and the cyclamen filling with its purple every valley"
350,L'ENVOI,"from Florence to Rome; for there was not much real beauty, perhaps, in"
351,L'ENVOI,"it, only long white dusty roads, and straight rows of formal poplars;"
352,L'ENVOI,but now and then some little breaking gleam of broken light would lend
353,L'ENVOI,to the gray field and the silent barn a secret and a mystery that were
354,L'ENVOI,"hardly their own, would transfigure for one exquisite moment the"
355,L'ENVOI,"peasants passing down through the vineyard, or the shepherd watching on"
356,L'ENVOI,"the hill, would tip the willows with silver, and touch the river into"
357,L'ENVOI,"gold; and the wonder of the effect, with the strange simplicity of the"
358,L'ENVOI,"material, always seemed to me to be a little like the quality of these"
359,L'ENVOI,the verses of my friend.

1297,ENDYMION,I saw some fair thing near.

1299,ENDYMION,"I saw the waters lapping round her feet,"
1300,ENDYMION,"The widening rings spread, follow out and die,"

1304,ENDYMION,"So I, Endymion, who lay bathing there,"

1309,ENDYMION,"A form white limbed and peerless, far above"
1310,ENDYMION,"The very fairest of imagined things,"

1550,AT TIBER MOUTH,And while we are deep in dreaming the light that was o'er us dies;
1551,AT TIBER MOUTH,We know not what of the present we shall stretch out our hand to save
1552,AT TIBER MOUTH,"Who sing of the life we long for, and not of the life we have;"
1553,AT TIBER MOUTH,"And yet if the chance were with us to gather the days misspent,"
1554,AT TIBER MOUTH,"Should we change the old resting-places, the wandering ways we went?"
1555,AT TIBER MOUTH,"They were strong, but the years are stronger; they are grown but a name"
1556,AT TIBER MOUTH,"that thrills,"
1557,AT TIBER MOUTH,And the wreck of their marble glory lies ghost-like over their hills.
1558,AT TIBER MOUTH,"So a shadow fell o'er our dreaming for the weary heart of the past,"
1559,AT TIBER MOUTH,"For the seed that the years have scattered, to reap so little at last."
1560,AT TIBER MOUTH,
1561,AT TIBER MOUTH,"And we went to the sea-shore forest, through a long colonnade of pines,"
1562,AT TIBER MOUTH,"Where the skies peep in and the sea, with a flitting of silver lines."
1563,AT TIBER MOUTH,And we came on an open place in the green deep heart of the wood
1564,AT TIBER MOUTH,Where I think in the years forgotten an altar of Faunus stood;
1565,AT TIBER MOUTH,From a spring in the long dark grasses two rivulets rise and run
1566,AT TIBER MOUTH,By the length of their sandy borders where the snake lies coiled in
1567,AT TIBER MOUTH,the sun.
1568,AT TIBER MOUTH,"And the stars of the white narcissus lie over the grass like snow,"
1569,AT TIBER MOUTH,And beyond in the shadowy places the crimson cyclamens grow;
1570,AT TIBER MOUTH,"Far up from their wave home yonder the sea-winds murmuring pass,"
1571,AT TIBER MOUTH,The branches quiver and creak and the lizard starts in the grass.
1572,AT TIBER MOUTH,"And we lay in the untrod moss and pillowed our cheeks with flowers,"
1573,AT TIBER MOUTH,"While the sun went over our heads, and we took no count of the hours;"
1574,AT TIBER MOUTH,From the end of the waving branches and under the cloudless blue
1575,AT TIBER MOUTH,Like sunbeams chained for a banner the thread-like gossamers flew.
1576,AT TIBER MOUTH,"And the joy of the woods came o'er us, and we felt that our world was"
1577,AT TIBER MOUTH,young
1578,AT TIBER MOUTH,With the gladness of years unspent and the sorrow of life unsung.
1579,AT TIBER MOUTH,"So we passed with a sound of singing along to the seaward way,"
1580,AT TIBER MOUTH,Where the sails of the fishermen folk came homeward over the bay;
1581,AT TIBER MOUTH,"For a cloud grew over the forest and darkened the sea-god's shrine,"
1582,AT TIBER MOUTH,And the hills of the silent city were only a ruby line.
1583,AT TIBER MOUTH,"But the sun stood still on the waves as we passed from the fading shores,"
1584,AT TIBER MOUTH,"And shone on our boat's red bulwarks and the golden blades of the oars,"
1585,AT TIBER MOUTH,And it seemed as we steered for the sunset that we passed through a
1586,AT TIBER MOUTH,"twilight sea,"
1587,AT TIBER MOUTH,From the gloom of a world forgotten to the light of a world to be.

1656,II,
1657,II,In taking an assignment of copyright from the surviving member of the
1658,II,firm of J.M. Stoddart & Co. it has been thought desirable to ascertain
1659,II,how _Rose Leaf and Apple Leaf_ came into existence in the peculiar
1660,II,_format_ which has long since set it apart as one of the choicest
1661,II,specimens of applied æsthetics in book-making that America has to offer
1662,II,"the collector. Under date of August 17, 1905, Mr. Stoddart wrote as"
1663,II,follows:
1664,II,
1665,II,"""I gladly furnish you with such information regarding this book as my"
1666,II,memory of a quarter of a century permits.
1667,II,
1668,II,The paper used in the _édition de luxe_ was a remainder which we found
1669,II,"in the possession of a Philadelphia paper dealer, (Charles Megargee, if"
1670,II,"I remember correctly), and was made at the famous Rittenhouse Mill on"
1671,II,"the Wissahickon, (near Philadelphia and said to be the first paper mill"
1672,II,"in America), for the (new) Government of the United States at the time"
1673,II,of the first issue of bonds or paper money. It therefore has a
1674,II,historical interest as well as a unique character.
1675,II,
1676,II,"I think this edition was not over 250 copies and price $1.75, but"
1677,II,"Brentano sold many of these for $3.00 and more, after having secured"
1678,II,Wilde's autograph on the cover. This edition is now certainly out of
1679,II,print and so far as I know impossible to procure anywhere. I have heard
1680,II,of copies changing hands at $5.00.
1681,II,
1682,II,The cheaper edition was issued at $1.00 but comparatively few sold as I
1683,II,was interested in greater matters and transferred the stock to J.B.
1684,II,"Lippincott & Co., where the lot was consumed in their fire."
1685,II,
1686,II,"I think the whole credit for the green leaves, and the general oddity of"
1687,II,the make-up of the book belongs to our office altho' Wilde may have been
1688,II,"consulted. Of course you recognize the reproduction of his seal."""
1689,II,
1690,II,All the circumstances connected with the publication of _Rose Leaf and
1691,II,Apple Leaf_ are confessedly not entirely clear to us. It is undoubtedly
1692,II,"true, as stated in the _N.Y Tribune_, (November 25, 1882,) that ""Mr."
1693,II,"Rennell Rodd, the young English poet whose verses were brought out here"
1694,II,in apple-green and rose-red under the enthusiastic auspices of Mr. Oscar
1695,II,"Wilde, has altered in his faith. He now disclaims any connection with"
1696,II,"the æsthetic school, and lets it be known that he had nothing to do with"
1697,II,the amazing dress in which his verses appeared. He intends to publish a
1698,II,"new volume."" This ""newsy"" note was based on a briefer one made just two"
1699,II,"weeks earlier in _The Academy_, (London, November 11, 1882,) viz.: ""We"
1700,II,understand that Mr. Rennell Rodd has a new volume of poems in the
1701,II,"press. He is anxious to disclaim any connection with the ""Æsthetic"""
1702,II,"school, with which he has been identified."""
1703,II,
1704,II,It may here be said that Mr. Rodd's first impressions were somewhat
1705,II,"different from what the above implies. In a letter dated October 6,"
1706,II,"1882, he wrote the American publisher:"
1707,II,
1708,II,"""I had not till lately seen the little edition,--which is charming. I"
1709,II,have seen no _édition de luxe_ in England to compare with it.... I have
1710,II,to thank you for the great care and delicacy with which this little book
1711,II,"has been published."""
1712,II,
1713,II,"What undoubtedly precipitated the trouble was not the _format_,"
1714,II,"""amazing"" though it may have seemed to the nameless scribe of the"
1715,II,"_Tribune_, but the proposal by the Stoddart firm to bring out an English"
1716,II,"edition. This could not be done, as Mr. Rodd pointed out, because the"
1717,II,"poems had already been published in London, and as he held the"
1718,II,"copyright, they could not be reissued save with his consent."
1719,II,"Furthermore: ""Since I have read the introduction I am not over pleased"
1720,II,at the way in which I find myself identified with much that I have no
1721,II,"sympathy with."" Last of all, probably first of all, ""there is one thing"
1722,II,"in it that has annoyed me excessively, and had I had a proof I should"
1723,II,not have allowed it to stand. The dedication is too effusive. I have
1724,II,"written to Mr. Wilde on this score, but if he does not write to you, I"
1725,II,must ask you as a personal favour to see to it. I want to have it
1726,II,"removed from all copies that go out for the future."""
1727,II,
1728,II,Unfortunately Mr. Rodd's request could not well be complied with: the
1729,II,"book had been published, and as it turned out no other edition was ever"
1730,II,called for by a more or less undiscerning public.
1731,II,
1732,II,A few other facts are in evidence. The original title of the work as
1733,II,"published by Rodd through David Bogue, London, 1881, was _Songs in the"
1734,II,"South_ and the dedication read ""To My Father."" It is conjectured that"
1735,II,"the dedication in the American edition was either based on, or copied"
1736,II,from an inscription written by the author in the copy Wilde brought over
1737,II,"with him. It read as follows: _To Oscar Wilde--/ ""Hearts Brother""--/"
1738,II,"These few songs and many songs to come_."" It may have been ""too"
1739,II,"effusive."" It is seldom, indeed, that we have the time and the place and"
1740,II,the loved one all together! It is not denied that this inscription _was_
1741,II,"written by Mr. Rodd, however effusive, and somehow, after the lapse of"
1742,II,years one wishes he had not so completely discountenanced the kindly
1743,II,offices of one who later on fell into such desperate extremes. It is
1744,II,quite likely that the evident editing bestowed upon the poems by Wilde
1745,II,"may have added to the displeasure of the poet. If so, we cannot, after"
1746,II,an acquaintance with the original London text of 1881 agree with him.
1747,II,"Two poems, ""Lucciole"" and ""Maidenhair,"" omitted by Wilde attest to his"
1748,II,"critical acumen, and nine additional poems derived, we may suppose from"
1749,II,"manuscript sources, do not lessen our respect for his supervising care."
1750,II,
1751,II,The introduction itself was without question a matter of the greatest
1752,II,"regret to Mr. Rodd. It credited him ""with much that annoys me"
1753,II,"excessively."" It is conceded however, that ""it has been kindly"
1754,II,"meant""--but if a second edition should be in request--it must be ""with"
1755,II,"no introduction""--there were available other poems that could be made to"
1756,II,take its place.
1757,II,
1758,II,"Admitting that Wilde went beyond the spirit, if not the letter of his"
1759,II,"friend's intent, it is a relief to find Rodd's admission that ""where a"
1760,II,"thing has been kindly meant, one cannot find fault.--On reflection I see"
1761,II,how foolish it was to make no reservations and restrictions of any
1762,II,"kind--For that very reason I have no excuse to make any complaint."" But"
1763,II,"still harping on the supposedly bad effects of Wilde's _L'Envoi_: ""It"
1764,II,did not occur to me at the time that I should be so completely
1765,II,identified with a lot of opinions with which I have no sympathy
1766,II,"whatever."" With this disclaimer our quotations from the Rodd letters"
1767,II,come to an end.
1768,II,
1769,II,"Well, after all is said what does it matter? The thing we care for most"
1770,II,"is just this brief, brilliant essay; as for the verse it is in the main"
1771,II,"well and good, despite benefits forgot. Some of it we feel assured will"
1772,II,"survive, has indeed, lived to find its way into many anthologies. As for"
1773,II,"the exquisite little _causerie_ it remains to us safe and secure,"
1774,II,veritable treasure-trove of unsullied gold against the years that the
1775,II,locust hath eaten.
