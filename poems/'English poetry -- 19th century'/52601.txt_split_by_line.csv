166,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
167,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
168,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,In tracing the origin of JOHN CLARE it is not necessary to go very far
169,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"back, reference to his grandfather and grandmother being a sufficient"
170,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,acknowledgement of the claims of genealogy. Following the road at
171,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"haphazard, trusting himself entirely to the guidance of fortune, and"
172,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,relying for provender upon his skill in drawing from a violin tunes of
173,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"the battle and the dance, about thirty years before Helpstone heard the"
174,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"first wail of its infant poet, there arrived at the village the vagabond"
175,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"and truculent Parker. Born under a wandering star, this man had footed"
176,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"it through many a country of Europe, careless whether daily necessity"
177,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,required from him an act of bloodshed or the scraping of a harum-scarum
178,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,reel designed to set frolic in the toes of man and maid. At the time of
179,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"his reaching Helpstone, a Northamptonshire village, destined to come"
180,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"into prominence because of the lyrics of its chief son, it happened that"
181,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the children were without a schoolmaster. In his time the adventurer
182,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"had played many parts. Why should he not add to the list? Effrontery,"
183,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"backed up by an uncertain amount of superficial attainment, won the day,"
184,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,and this fiddling Odysseus obtained the vacant position. Of his
185,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"boastings, his bowings, his drinkings, there is no need to make history,"
186,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,but his soft tongue demands a moment of attention. We may take it for
187,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,granted that he picked out the fairest flower among the maids of
188,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Helpstone as the target for all the darts at his disposal, each of"
189,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"which, we may be sure, was polished by use. The daughter of the parish"
190,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"clerk was a fortress easy to capture. Depicted by himself, the rascal"
191,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"loomed as a hero; till at last the affair proceeded beyond a mere kiss,"
192,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,and the poor girl pleaded for the offices of a priest in order to save
193,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"her child from the stain of illegitimacy. However, the schoolmaster"
194,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"proved glib of promises, but fleet of foot, for on the day following his"
195,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,sweetheart’s revelations he was nowhere to be found. In the course of
196,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"time JOHN CLARE’S father was born. In his turn, he grew into the want of"
197,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"a mate, found her, married her, and begot an honour for England."
198,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
199,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"JOHN CLARE was born at Helpstone, on the 13th day of July, 1793, and"
200,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,born into a heritage of handicaps. To say nothing of the fruits of
201,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"exposure to rough weathers which were ripening in his father’s system,"
202,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"the boy had the disadvantage of being one of twins, a sister"
203,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"accompanying him into the world. His mother suffered from dropsy, and we"
204,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,may well believe that what life the children sucked from her breast
205,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"contained elements threatening their future health. Small and frail, the"
206,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,lad had the additional misfortune to open his eyes in the cottage of a
207,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"pauper, instead of in some abode where his natural weakness could have"
208,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"been nourished by foods giving inward encouragement, and of a sort sure"
209,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,to result in the building up of hearty fibre. Despite all these early
210,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"rebuffs, JOHN CLARE kept hold of life. When still very young he set out"
211,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"full of faith to explore the junction of earth and heaven, for on the"
212,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"horizon he could see the point of their meeting. In this incident, as"
213,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"well as in many another of his childhood, it is easy to detect signs of"
214,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,a spirit triumphantly unfitted for residence in a clay hovel at
215,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Helpstone. As luck would have it, a kind of rough-and-ready poetry was"
216,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"not altogether out of the boy’s reach, for his father’s head was stuffed"
217,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"with innumerable odds-and-ends of rhyme, some of which he was in the"
218,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,habit of reciting to his son. Entertainment of the same sort was
219,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"obtainable from old Granny Bains, a weather-worn cow-herd, to whom the"
220,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,future poet was attracted by her store of ditties; whose especial
221,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,cronies were the wind and rain. Under such illiterate tutors little JOHN
222,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"CLARE moved closer and closer to the soul of poetry, musing while he put"
223,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,a limit to the vagrancy of the geese and sheep for which he had been
224,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,appointed guardian as soon as the main part of his schooling was over.
225,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,His departure from the scholastic bench took place when his years had
226,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"reached a very unripe total, for with only seven birthdays entered in"
227,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"his book of life, at an age when a child is usually at the commencement"
228,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"of historical and geographical perplexities, he was turned out into the"
229,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,fields as a wage-earner. Instead of feeling elated at his escape from
230,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"the scholastic coils of Dame Bullimore, as many a lad would have done,"
231,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"JOHN CLARE, being aware of his budding wits, although unable to"
232,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"comprehend the motive force from within, looked round his small district"
233,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,in search of fresh educational territories to be conquered by his brain.
234,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Having saved a few pence he made overtures to Mr. James Merrishaw, the"
235,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"schoolmaster of Glinton, and in the duller months of the year, when days"
236,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"were short, he attended certain evening classes, notwithstanding the"
237,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,fact that the journeys involved taxed his boot-leather severely; for
238,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Glinton is nearly five miles away from Helpstone. Here he learned well,"
239,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"but not altogether wisely, if we may agree that the boy’s struggles with"
240,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the intricacies of algebra were conspicuous for mis-applied energy. But
241,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,something more valuable than baffling equations resulted from JOHN
242,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"CLARE’S connection with the sage of Glinton, for Mr. Merrishaw made him"
243,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"free of his books, thus feeding more and more that desire for knowledge"
244,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,which sprang up in him not less rapidly than a mushroom grows in a
245,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,meadow.
246,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
247,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Even in such a loose piece of biography as this--an essay which has no
248,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,other aim than to glance in passing at the salient features of CLARE’S
249,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,career--a little space must be spared for mention of the boy’s year of
250,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"service as factotum at the “Blue Bell” at Helpstone, where he had almost"
251,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"as much leisure as work, because it was here that his hermitical notions"
252,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,and moods of dream increased at an extraordinary rate. Served by
253,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"travelling pedlars, whose packs let him share in fancy the terror of Red"
254,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Riding Hood, the adventures of Valentine and Orson, to say no word of"
255,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Sinbad’s amazements, the small student entered for the first time into"
256,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"the recesses of fairy land, there to lave his hands in its abundant"
257,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"jewels, while making extortionate demands upon the swiftness of genies."
258,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Little by little, algebra went to the wall, yielding as much to the"
259,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"boy’s spreading passion for Nature’s feast of grass and flowers, as for"
260,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"the limitless enchantments born of imagination, since at this period the"
261,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"list of impulses communicated to him by wayside blossoms, by clouds, by"
262,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"winds, and by the easy ballads of thrushes, daily grew longer. The boy"
263,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,began to appreciate the largeness of God’s school as compared with the
264,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,limits reigned over by Dame Bullimore and the pedagogue of Glinton; and
265,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,his increasing sense of hearing enabled him to receive into his
266,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,understanding fragments of those sermons which are preached by stones.
267,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Hunger for expansion lived and lusted in his heart. No better example of
268,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,this fury of craving could be adduced than the story of how the young
269,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,poet entered into a combat with circumstances in order that he might
270,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"obtain a copy of Thomson’s “Seasons.” Mental agony, as well as a"
271,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"superlative degree of hoarding, went to the purchase of that coveted"
272,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"volume, the history of which is fully set forth in Mr. Frederick"
273,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Martin’s stimulating “Life of John Clare.” During these glowing months
274,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the boy of genius had not ceased from utilising every chance scrap of
275,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,paper for the purpose of jotting down his exercises in rhyme. By means
276,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,of a forgivable trick he secured the verbal patronage of his father and
277,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"mother, who could not see any merit in his verses till he pretended"
278,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,that they were the compositions of others. As poem after poem was
279,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"written their author stored them in a cranny in the wall, a retreat at"
280,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"last invaded by Mrs. Clare, with the result that she was wont to help"
281,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the boiling of the kettle by burning underneath it the early pipings of
282,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,her son.
283,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
284,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"At this point, the youth in whose story the interest lies being sixteen"
285,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"years old, Cupid, with no loss of his bright qualities after so many"
286,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"centuries of exercise, comes into the recital. To JOHN CLARE, who was"
287,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"moving rapidly towards the full worship of all things lovely, Mary Joyce"
288,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,appeared to be nobody less bewildering and enchanting than a stray from
289,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"heaven; and though he was prevented from wearing her, the dice of"
290,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Fortune falling adverse from the box, he never ceased to regard her as"
291,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,his ideal. Of the many pathetic incidents of his life not the least
292,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,touching is the fact that in his years of a broken brain he cherished as
293,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,a chief delusion the belief that Mary Joyce was indeed his wife. What
294,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the feelings of a nature so intense were when the father of his
295,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,sweetheart intervened as the proverbial slip between the cup and the
296,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"lip, we can only conjecture, though the tracing of results is easy"
297,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"enough. After leaving the tankards and the horses of the “Blue Bell,”"
298,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,JOHN CLARE cast about him for some other form of employment. Escaping
299,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"the pains of stone-cutting and cobbling, he succeeded in becoming a"
300,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"gardener’s apprentice at Burghley Park, the seat of the Marquis of"
301,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Exeter. Parker Clare began to think that his son was born with an
302,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"invisible silver spoon in his mouth, while to JOHN eight shillings a"
303,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"week, with lodging free, smacked of the robbers’ cave in the “Arabian"
304,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Nights.” In reality, this position was altogether undesirable, for the"
305,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"head gardener, not content to degrade himself alone by an excessive"
306,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"swallowing of stimulants, actually devoted his best efforts to make"
307,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,drunkards of his pupils. Unfortunately temptation loomed large at the
308,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,very moment when CLARE was ripe for mischief. Romance was worsted by
309,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,swipes (the indignity of the episode may be held to excuse the slang);
310,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"by means of such thin nepenthe, regret for the loss of Mary Joyce grew"
311,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,less and less; and it not infrequently occurred that the new apprentice
312,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"slept off his potations by the hedge-side, with no better blanket than a"
313,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"mist, and with the damp turf for sole mattress, thus unconsciously"
314,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"taking in a cargo of ague and fever for future unloading. At last CLARE,"
315,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,in company with another lad who was anxious to show a clean pair of
316,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"heels to the abstract and concrete brutalities of his master, fled to"
317,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Grantham, and thence to Newark-upon-Trent, where both the runaways"
318,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,obtained work under a nurseryman. But CLARE was homesick; his mother’s
319,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,face was as a magnet pulling him to the familiar hovel at Helpstone; no
320,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,longer could he obey that decree of divorce from his native scenes
321,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,pronounced against him by the impalpable judge and jury of circumstance.
322,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"One day, after a terrible journey on foot, he burst into the hut of his"
323,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"parents, weeping for joy to gain for his body the residence which his"
324,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,spirit had occupied so long.
325,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
326,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,No sooner had CLARE returned his muscles to the various tasks of a farm
327,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,labourer than he harked back with a love greater than ever to Thomson’s
328,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"“Seasons,” reading it as he went to and from his work. The chief part of"
329,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"his leisure he used for the composition of verses, an occupation which"
330,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"served to fix upon him habits of timidity and shyness, especially as he"
331,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"was without a single sympathiser. Because of his strange manners, his"
332,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"fits of abstraction as well as of uttered enthusiasm, his appetite for"
333,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"solitude, the neighbours passed from mere mockery to whispers of a mind"
334,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"diseased, and even of a nature beset by the black ministers of magic."
335,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"The fact that about this time his mother, for the purposes of fuel, made"
336,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,a clean sweep of his poetic accumulations did its share to loosen his
337,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,moral control; and when his attempts at gaining encouragement from Mr.
338,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Thomas Porter, and patronage from Lord Milton, to whom the parish clerk"
339,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"of Helpstone displayed the rustic poet, failed, he betook himself, this"
340,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"time of his own accord, to the drunken company of the worst livers in"
341,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the village. Much of CLARE’S future misery proceeded from this lapse.
342,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Before bad example had done its utmost to ruin him, Providence, in the"
343,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"somewhat unusual disguise of a recruiting sergeant, came to the rescue."
344,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"JOHN’S period of military service was brief, for after being instructed"
345,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,at Oundle in the goose-step--that foundation of a glorious career under
346,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"arms--the corps of which he was a member was disbanded, and he was"
347,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,enabled once more to assume the civilian smock at Helpstone. For all
348,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,booty he had a second-rate copy of “Paradise Lost” and “The Tempest.” A
349,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"matter of more importance, however, was the fact that he had departed"
350,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,from the pernicious influence of the roysterers who were leading him to
351,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,destruction. A number of small adventures were not slow to follow his
352,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"short intimacy with the clothes and tools of war, what with his trial of"
353,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"a gipsy’s life, and his courting of several girls, one of whom,"
354,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Elizabeth Newton by name, drove him into a fit of melancholy by playing"
355,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the part of a jilt. In this state of mind nothing could have suited him
356,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"better than change of scene, and his departure to Bridge Casterton,"
357,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"there to learn the details of a lime-burner’s trade, happened at a"
358,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,moment fortunate for heart and head alike. It was while he resided in
359,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"this neighbourhood that he confided to Mr. Henson, a bookseller of"
360,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Market Deeping, the fact of his colloquy with the Muse, following the"
361,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,avowal by a display of his powers. This confession was the germ of a
362,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,wide circulation.
363,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
364,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"And now we are arrived at a fresh, and, as far as matrimony is"
365,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"concerned, a final love. CLARE being now twenty-four years of age, it"
366,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"was high time for him to nurse an established affection, and he was"
367,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"lucky to win the heart of Martha Turner, the “Patty” of several poems to"
368,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,be found in the collected works of the poet. To him Martha was another
369,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"waif from the skies, even though she tortured her poetical admirer by"
370,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the time-honoured practice of appearing to waver between two suitors.
371,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,The conduct of this episode was made up of petty events prosaic enough
372,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"to the onlooker, but sufficiently lethal for the parties most"
373,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"interested. Tiffs, sour looks from parents, despairs, showers, rainbows,"
374,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,were the constituents of CLARE’S courtship. A flat and always fortunate
375,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,wooing would doubtless have been hostile to poetry. Because of his
376,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"longing to supply two mouths with the necessaries of life, and because"
377,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,it was clearly proved that Cupid would not even be able to munch a
378,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,satisfactory portion of crust if the lovers founded their faith solely
379,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"on the wage of a lime-burner, CLARE conceived the idea of publishing a"
380,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"volume of song, his mind appointing Mr. Henson, of Market Deeping, a"
381,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,comrade for his project. A month devoted to the base uses of the
382,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,treadmill would not have cost the poet more labour than did the
383,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"composition of his prospectus, three hundred copies of which the"
384,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"bookseller agreed to print, as well as a specimen sonnet, for one pound."
385,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,But this trap for subscribers was baited with too much candour. If ever
386,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"a poet met with a crushing response to his first appeal for a hearing,"
387,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"surely JOHN CLARE was that man. Seven patrons came forward, more, we may"
388,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"guess, in kindness than in hope of literary luxury. CLARE, of course,"
389,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,experienced the superlatives of disgust; and when the printer of the
390,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,artless prospectus wrote to inform him that the adventure must drop
391,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"unless fifteen pounds appeared to back it up, he could not withhold"
392,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,himself from replying in a strain to the last degree impolitic. To add
393,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"to his griefs, a rather wide gulf was at this time yawning between"
394,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Martha Turner and himself, the bridging of which was a feat of"
395,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"engineering extremely hard to accomplish. Moreover, and here is an"
396,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"illustration of the proverb that it never rains but it pours, the owner"
397,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,of the limekilns discharged his lyrical servant on the score of his
398,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,inattention to business. The whole neighbourhood being somewhat
399,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"scandalised at what was considered presumption, for labourers of CLARE’S"
400,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"type were not required to assert themselves in prose, much less in"
401,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"poetry, the disappointed lime-burner, with a heart given up to aching,"
402,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"returned once more to Helpstone, where he would have starved but for"
403,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,parochial relief. So genius sat down to eat the parish loaf.
404,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
405,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"However tightly twisted the rosebud may be, windy and sunny fingers will"
406,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,unpack it at last. At the very moment when CLARE was reading himself as
407,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"the peculiar prey of disaster, he was destined to behold the bright back"
408,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,of the cloud which had confronted him with such ominous persistence. By
409,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,strange approaches the news of _Clare’s_ devotion to and production of
410,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"poetry arrived at Mr. Drury, a bookseller who was on the point of taking"
411,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"over a business at Stamford from Mr. Thompson, of that town. In company"
412,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"with a friend, Mr. Drury proceeded to Helpstone, interviewed the"
413,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"astonished poet, glanced through some rhymed samples, and finally"
414,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"declared his intention to publish a volume at his own risk, hearing"
415,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,which intelligence CLARE once more rose heavenward in the balloon of
416,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"hope, forgetting how certain it was that impediments to free flight"
417,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"would make themselves manifest. Owing to the offices of Mr. Drury, CLARE"
418,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"became acquainted with Mr. Gilchrist, of Stamford, a gentlemen with an"
419,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Oxford education and a grocer’s shop, who played the part of a true"
420,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"friend to the poet, if we except his action in making public some verses"
421,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,of CLARE’S which had more wine than inspiration in them. It has been
422,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,contended that Mr. Gilchrist filled the post of patron with a want of
423,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,reserve which made CLARE feel his position acutely; for the eating of
424,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"humble-pie has never been a really popular amusement. Be this as it may,"
425,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,lovers of “Poems descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery” have a great
426,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,deal for which to thank Mr. Gilchrist. After promising CLARE to
427,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"undertake the publication of his first book, Mr. Drury experienced a few"
428,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"bad hours. To begin with, the ill-spelt, rope-tied, unpunctuated mass of"
429,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,manuscript entrusted to him by its author had a most unpromising aspect.
430,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"He tested it as best he could, but, as the glow of the adventure had"
431,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"already faded a little, found no particular reasons for comfort. In this"
432,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"strait he enlisted the acumen of an acquaintance, a clergyman, whose"
433,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"name was, somewhat appropriately, Twopenny, in order to see how the"
434,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"verses might strike a contemporary. The prophetic Twopenny, with brutal"
435,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"candour, described CLARE’S bundle of reeds to be so much twaddle. When"
436,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Mr. Drury delivered this oracle, the grief of the poet was such that the"
437,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"bookseller was shocked. Had it not been for the anguish of the singer,"
438,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,it is quite possible that the bookseller of Stamford would have
439,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"departed, with decent circuity, from his bargain; as it was, he"
440,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,determined to procure yet another opinion. He happened to be a relative
441,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"of Mr. John Taylor, the London publisher, to whom he despatched the"
442,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,uncouth manuscript in question. Mr. Taylor’s were not as Mr. Twopenny’s
443,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"eyes. He knew diamonds when he saw them, even though a polisher had not"
444,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,exerted his craft upon them.
445,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
446,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Before proceeding to describe the effect made on the public by the
447,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"appearance of “Poems descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery,” it will be"
448,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,necessary to revert for a moment to the affairs of love. No sooner was
449,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the first quarrel between the sweethearts swept away by the broom of
450,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"reconciliation than the flame of passion, burning to a conquering"
451,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"height, made a bonfire out of the broken materials of virtue. This"
452,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,disaster was followed by fresh bickerings. Martha Turner found it
453,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"impossible to be for ever displaying a cheerful front. Her tears, her"
454,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"reproaches, her simple tricks to make CLARE jealous, resulted in a"
455,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"serious breach. CLARE, listening far too readily to glib and evil"
456,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"persuasions from within, appears to have convinced himself that he was"
457,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the injured party; whereupon he began to wound Martha by flirting
458,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"outrageously with Betty Sell, the daughter of a Southorp labourer. This"
459,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"inglorious behaviour received a sudden check, just after the publication"
460,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"of CLARE’S book, by reason of a letter from Martha Turner, in which she"
461,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"spoke of her coming motherhood, and implored the author of her shame to"
462,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"cleanse her in so far as he was able. Truth to tell, CLARE was by this"
463,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"time wellnigh assured that Betty was his favourite, but he had the"
464,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"manliness to follow the right star, and on the 16th of March, 1820, was"
465,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,united to Martha at Great Casterton Church. A month after the wedding
466,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Anna Maria Clare was born to him. As this marriage would hardly have
467,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"been possible but for the stir occasioned by the poems, we may now give"
468,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,a short history of the events immediately following their issue.
469,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
470,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Although the art of preliminary puffing was as yet in swaddling clothes,"
471,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"so to speak, Mr. Taylor contrived to interest a large number of his"
472,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"acquaintances, some of whom had access to the columns of certain"
473,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"periodicals. Moreover, Mr. Gilchrist’s magazine article had proved a"
474,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,useful forerunner. The book itself was born into a golden clime. The
475,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"reading world happening to be sick of Metropolitan and modish fare,"
476,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,CLARE’S birds and mayblossoms came as a tonic to all who were desirous
477,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,of a change. The triumph of the country over the town was of the
478,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,completest sort; customers poured into Mr. Taylor’s shop in their
479,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,anxiety to purchase copies of the labourer’s poems; for once the critics
480,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,and the public were agreed. Journals of fine stature joined with
481,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"insignificant prints in praising CLARE to the skies, and when this new"
482,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"writer actually succeeded in carrying the defences of the “Quarterly,”"
483,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,it was allowed on all sides that lion-hunters were in luck’s way. CLARE
484,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,was fortunate in some of his advertisers. Rossini and Madame Vestris
485,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,brought him into further prominence by means of a musical setting and of
486,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,recitations at Covent Garden. Genius in hobnailed boots and a
487,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,smock-frock shouldered aside the more usual figures of literary London.
488,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"While all this was taking place in Fleet Street, as well as in the"
489,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"aristocratic sections of the capital, rumours of CLARE’S amazing success"
490,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,reached the county residences in the neighbourhood of Helpstone.
491,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"General Birch Reynardson gave him to eat with his lackeys, and Viscount"
492,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Milton flung seventeen guineas into his lap with as much feeling as he
493,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,might have thrown seventeen crumbs to a cur. In great contrast to
494,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,blue-blooded vulgarity of this stamp was the Marquis of Exeter’s
495,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"treatment of the poet, although a more liberal display of tact upon his"
496,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,part would have enabled CLARE to leave his mansion with a heart given
497,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,over completely to joy and gratitude. Friends of _Clare_ are not likely
498,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,to forget the generosity of the Marquis. An annuity of fifteen guineas
499,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,for life was indeed a handsome backing of the Muse. Because of this gift
500,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Anna Maria Clare was born in wedlock; without it her parents would not
501,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,have been able to marry as soon as they did. Foolish folk spared the
502,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,poet none of the customary agonies. He was pestered by inquisitive
503,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"visitors; collectors of autographs bullied him for his signature, and"
504,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the owners of albums plagued him to encourage them in their whim. Some
505,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,persons of the goody-goody type improved the shining hour by sending him
506,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"an assortment of tracts, the fate of which is wrapped in impenetrable"
507,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"mystery. CLARE was a simple child of nature, certainly, but we may"
508,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,almost take it for granted that he left these precious effusions
509,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,undigested.
510,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
511,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,The news that CLARE was about to trust his bones to London almost
512,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,paralysed his rustic intimates. Generations of romancers had made
513,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,strange impressions upon the provincial mind. Particularly full of
514,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"odious vaticinations was James Burridge, an old farm labourer whose head"
515,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,was stuffed to the bursting point with stories horrifying enough to make
516,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"CLARE’S flesh creep. According to this authority, London thoroughly"
517,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,deserved the doubtful compliment of being compared with Babylon. He
518,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"declared that there were trap-doors in the streets, down which wayfarers"
519,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,flopped into cauldrons of boiling water amid the plaudits of ministering
520,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"cut-throats! CLARE quailed, his parents wept, and his wife approached"
521,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,within measurable distance of hysterics. But even the prospect of being
522,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,cooked in this casual manner did not suffice to deter the poet from
523,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"visiting Mr. Taylor, of Fleet Street. That he set some value upon the"
524,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,legends of James Burridge is proved by his adoption of a small device to
525,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,baffle the trapdoor operators. Believing safety to be resident in a
526,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,smock-frock and in boots the soles of which sustained grinning rows of
527,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"hobnails, he set forth upon his journey thus attired. He was not long in"
528,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"regretting his precautions, for he soon perceived that his costume"
529,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"evoked from onlookers merry comments and derisive glances. In the end,"
530,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Mr. Taylor supplied him with an overcoat which covered the defects of
531,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"his attire. Whatever the heat of theatre or drawing-room, whether among"
532,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"lords or commoners, JOHN CLARE clung to this garment with the courage of"
533,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"despair. What his agonies were, because of his raiment, when driven into"
534,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"a corner by a countess for a _tête-à-tête_, we can do no more than dimly"
535,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,conjecture. In the course of this visit CLARE was introduced to Admiral
536,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Lord Radstock, who took a great fancy to him and remained a firm friend,"
537,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"and to Mrs. Emmerson, a lady who, seeing that her purse and sympathies"
538,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,were always ready to alleviate the mischances of young poets and
539,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"artists, might be described as a female Maecenas. To this rather gushing"
540,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,and sentimental patroness of the arts CLARE from time to time addressed
541,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,letters which were not devoid of the elements of wildness and Platonic
542,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,passion. At last his emphasis became so absurd that Mrs. Emmerson
543,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,requested him to send back her portrait. Had a jug of cold water been
544,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,poured down the poet’s neck he could not have been more cooled than he
545,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,was by this piece of diplomacy. The shrine was despoiled. The picture
546,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"was despatched by the next carrier; and doubtless Martha, who must have"
547,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"hated the sight of Mrs. Emmerson’s face, congratulated herself in"
548,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,secret. There is no need to say more about CLARE’S first visit to
549,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"London, if we except mention of the fact that the mighty city’s chief"
550,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,effect upon him was to fill his breast with yearning for the oaks and
551,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,rivulets round about his native village. A week in the Metropolis had
552,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,been more than enough for the countryman. As he rumbled homeward in the
553,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"coach, he had dreams of unsullied waters and unsmoked rainbows; and he"
554,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,counted over his country joys as a miser adds up the total of his
555,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"various coins. At the top of his treasures stood his wife and baby, for,"
556,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,with all his Platonic declensions from the state most comfortable to
557,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Martha, he was an affectionate husband and father. About this time"
558,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,several hearty friends strove with might and main to secure a competence
559,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,for the poet. A sum of four hundred and twenty pounds was the result of
560,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,their earnestness; but when it is remembered that Earl Fitzwilliam and
561,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,CLARE’S publishers were between them responsible for no less than two
562,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"hundred of this amount, the harvest of solicitation is not notable for"
563,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,bounteousness. Dr. Bell--a friend of the right complexion--extracted an
564,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"annual ten pounds from Earl Spencer, so that, what with this gift, the"
565,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Marquis of Exeter’s donation, and the fund, the genius of Helpstone was"
566,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,possessed of an income of forty-five pounds per annum. CLARE felt a
567,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"very mendicant throughout all these transactions, and even went so far"
568,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,as to disavow them in letters despatched to his noble helpers. Had it
569,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,not been for the persuasions of Mr. Gilchrist and the amusing invectives
570,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"of Dr. Bell, he would have kicked with greater persistence against the"
571,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,pricks of charity.
572,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
573,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"As soon as the harvest was over, CLARE made an end of labouring in the"
574,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,fields. He was under agreement to hand over another volume of poetry to
575,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Messrs. Taylor and Hessey for publication early in 1821. It was now his
576,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"earnest endeavour to fulfil his share of the bargain, and he bared his"
577,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,forehead to inspiration. CLARE always felt himself cheated and empty of
578,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,ideas when shut up within four walls. The Muse would not follow him to
579,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"his fireside, but she would frolic with him the live-long day in the"
580,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"open air, filling him with buoyancy, kissing his lips, and smoothing out"
581,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"his wrinkles. Seated inside an old oak, whose heart had gradually passed"
582,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"into the atmosphere, CLARE was wont to pour his soul in song, and so"
583,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,fruitful were the hints of his unseen companion that he soon had a great
584,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"collection of new verses. All that he approved he desired to publish,"
585,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"but Mr. Taylor spoke a few strong words in favour of weeding,"
586,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,suggesting to CLARE that he should play the part of Herod toward some of
587,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the children of his imagination. A deadlock ensued. For a time the poet
588,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"was adamant, the publishers marble. In this difficulty CLARE bethought"
589,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,himself of Mr. Gilchrist as an excellent agent for the casting of oil on
590,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"the troubled waters. This gentleman, however, was thick in a squabble of"
591,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"his own, and when CLARE appeared unsympathetic he displayed a spirit"
592,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,very much huffed. At last the tension between poet and publishers became
593,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"less, with the result that in the middle of September “The Village"
594,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Minstrel” was ready for purchasers. The two volumes were handsomely
595,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"presented; the type was beautiful, and a couple of steel engravings made"
596,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"a brave show. Despite the attractions of genius, despite the various"
597,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"ornaments, “The Village Minstrel” met with rather an icy greeting. Among"
598,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the several explanations of this coldness put forward by the publishers
599,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"and by certain friends, the likeliest is that the season of issue was"
600,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"not wisely chosen. In this year such gods of the pen as Scott, Byron,"
601,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Shelley, Wordsworth, Keats, and Lamb distributed joy to many a reader,"
602,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,so that poor JOHN CLARE naturally ran a great risk of being overlooked.
603,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,It was now proved how dangerous had been the heat of his first welcome.
604,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Superlatives had been done to death; the lion-hunters had exhausted
605,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"their treacly compliments, and were now eagerly scanning the literary"
606,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"horizon in the hope of seeing approach a fresh victim. Moreover, some"
607,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,injudicious persons had descanted more upon CLARE’S poverty than upon
608,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"his remarkable powers. It was the general opinion, as Mr. Martin points"
609,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"out in his biography, that a really capable poet should be able to"
610,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"support himself. If he did not succeed in so doing, then he was but a"
611,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,dabbler while pretending to be a priest. The logic was of the sort to
612,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"shrink from scrutiny, but it contented the shallow sufficiently well. To"
613,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"my thinking, the charge of twelve shillings for these two volumes was a"
614,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"factor in the neglect which overtook them. Be this as it may, a"
615,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"collection of verse containing some exquisite and lovely pieces, and"
616,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"marking in some respects an advance upon the forerunning book, fell upon"
617,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"the stony patch of indifference, there to remain while verse of fifty"
618,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,times less merit enjoyed a vogue out of proportion to its worth. In a
619,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"word, CLARE’S second luck was the exact opposite of his first. In days"
620,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,saddened by the reflection that he had failed to hold by the glory which
621,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"he obtained at his first venture, it was balm to CLARE to know that"
622,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Robert Bloomfield at least warmly approved of what lukewarm triflers
623,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,failed to appreciate.
624,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
625,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"In the summer of 1821, not long after the meteoric appearance at"
626,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Helpstone of a minor poet, who presented CLARE with a sonnet and a"
627,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"one-pound note in a glorious burst of bounty and condescension, Mr. John"
628,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Taylor passed a few hours in the little Northamptonshire village. Under
629,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the guidance of CLARE he reviewed many of the spots which the poet had
630,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"celebrated in song, and, in some cases, he was amazed to find how CLARE"
631,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,had compelled dull localities to yield strains both abundant and
632,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,beautiful. But to gather roses in a desert is child’s play for a genius.
633,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Upon taking leave, Mr. Taylor invited CLARE to spend a few weeks in"
634,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Fleet Street. Luckily the poet decided to avail himself of this offer,"
635,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,for about this time he was far too frequent a visitor at the “Blue
636,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Bell,” where he had his corner reserved, and passed for the chief of the"
637,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,assembly. This meant more than sufficient exercise for the gullet. The
638,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,bad habit contracted at Burghley Hall was strengthened at these
639,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"sittings, and CLARE, deplorably unstable in some mental particulars,"
640,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,approached nearer and nearer to that abyss which has engulfed so many
641,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"great wits. The winter being over, CLARE departed for London. He was"
642,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"something of a bolt from the blue to Mr. Taylor, but that gentleman was"
643,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"not slow in welcoming his client, though he looked askance at the gay"
644,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,pocket handkerchief in which was contained the whole of his friend’s
645,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"luggage. As the publisher was very busy, he delivered CLARE into the"
646,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"keeping of Thomas Hood, who, in turn, handed him over to the head porter"
647,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,of the firm. The poet was not long in finding his way to the house of
648,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Mrs. Emmerson, whose hospitality was as frank and unstinted as ever."
649,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Here CLARE met Mr. Rippingille, a young artist with a dash of Dick"
650,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Swiveller in him, who had a strong appetite for noisy pranks. In company"
651,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,with this unreflective spirit the peasant from the Midlands attended
652,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"some very dubious functions, penetrating to quarters of the Metropolis"
653,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"which were famous for the topmost achievements of rascality, where he"
654,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,ran riot among various intoxicants. After besieging a certain beauteous
655,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"actress with all the languishing glances at their command, these foolish"
656,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"comrades would pledge her in pale ale till, like Byron, they seemed to"
657,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,walk upon the ceiling. Thus were buttresses added to CLARE’S unfortunate
658,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,predilection. Those who revel by gaslight are not fond of returning home
659,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"before midnight, and CLARE was no exception to the rule. But the hours"
660,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"of his choice were not grateful to Mr. Taylor, whose sense of the"
661,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"fitness of things was offended by his visitor’s conduct. Therefore,"
662,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Thomas Hood was deputed to inform CLARE that he was vexing his host, an"
663,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,intimation which resulted in the poet carrying his handkerchief full of
664,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"belongings to Mrs. Emmerson’s house, where his manners did not improve."
665,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Under the accomplished tuition of Mr. Rippingille he found how easy the
666,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"descent of Avernus was. His next move was to Chiswick, where the Rev. H."
667,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"T. Cary entertained him. His stay here was brief, owing to an amusing"
668,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,episode. Strangely enough CLARE was ignorant of the fact that his
669,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,elderly host had a young and handsome wife. In the belief that he was
670,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"doing homage to the charms of one of Mr. Cary’s grown-up daughters, he"
671,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"addressed several poems, which were not without the quality of ardour,"
672,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"to the wife of the translator’s bosom. After this, although his"
673,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"explanation was accepted and understood, CLARE thought he had better"
674,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,depart from Chiswick. During this stay in London the Northamptonshire
675,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"poet was introduced to William Gifford and Charles Lamb, the latter of"
676,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"whom, if report may be trusted, was guilty of a rather coarse jape at"
677,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"his expense. Not long after this, CLARE returned to Helpstone. It is"
678,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"worthy to note that, whereas his first visit to London had only"
679,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"accentuated his country raptures, the village minstrel now actually"
680,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"pined for the fatted calves, the theatres, the glitter, and the merry"
681,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,companions of the city. The taint of Rippingille was upon him. Reaction
682,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,came in time; the meadows captured him again; but this small piece of
683,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,history is significant of much.
684,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
685,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"As soon as he was once more in possession of his best self, CLARE began"
686,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,to face his troubles--most of which sprang from insufficient means at
687,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,this time--with as much courage as he could summon. He was rather slow
688,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,in being convinced that he could not derive a steady income from the
689,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,composition of poetry; but when this truth was driven home his mind at
690,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,once became agile in devising numberless plans for the betterment of his
691,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"state, for he suffered from a torturing anxiety when he remembered for"
692,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,how many his fate had appointed him the bread-winner. He was now
693,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"fighting hand to hand with poverty, valorous in behalf of his aged"
694,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"mother, his wife, and his little children, who enjoyed the fruits of"
695,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,whatsoever victories were gained far more than did their defender--since
696,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,he secretly starved himself in order to increase the tale of loaves
697,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"presided over by Patty. In the year 1823, worn out by his failures to"
698,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"extract a supporting flow of guineas from either poetry or agriculture,"
699,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"he fell very ill, just after the shock occasioned by the death of Mr."
700,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Gilchrist. His recovery was of the slowest, and it was not till he was"
701,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"put by Mr. Taylor under the care of Dr. Darling, in London, that the"
702,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,poet mended in a manner to satisfy his friends. It was during this third
703,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"visit to the Metropolis that CLARE came in contact with De Quincey,"
704,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Coleridge, William Hazlitt, and Allan Cunningham, to mention only four"
705,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,of the prominent men whom Mr. Taylor delighted to make members of his
706,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,evening parties. CLARE found his imaginary portraits to be very
707,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"deceptive, especially so in the case of De Quincey. The bulk and dull"
708,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"appearance of Coleridge also surprised, as well as disappointed, him,"
709,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,for he had pictured the great man in a guise completely opposite to
710,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,reality. There is little need to say that in Mr. Taylor’s house nothing
711,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,of a bacchanalian tinge was likely to occur; but even the moderate
712,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,pleasures of the publisher’s entertainments threatened to destroy the
713,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"good brought about by the skill and care of Dr. Darling, and therefore"
714,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Clare was induced to return to Helpstone, where he once more renewed his"
715,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"search for employment, encountered thoughtless snubs from the high and"
716,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"mighty of the district, and gradually approached the line which"
717,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,separates mental health from mental disease. He was for ever engaged in
718,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,keeping the wolf from the door. He did not eat a due share of what his
719,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"means supplied, denying himself from day to day with a rigidity which"
720,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,could not fail to injure both body and brain. At the end of the year
721,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"1825, after working in the cornfields throughout the harvest, CLARE"
722,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"turned to the composition of poetry, and produced “The Shepherd’s"
723,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Calendar,” a volume in which he used the file to excellent purpose."
724,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Already bruised and wounded by the rough edges of life, the poet found"
725,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,an additional hardship in the fact that Mr. Taylor long delayed to
726,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,publish this third book of verse; for to make both ends meet was now a
727,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,miracle beyond his accomplishing. Although several editors of those
728,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,elegant annuals which were then so much in favour had asked CLARE to
729,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"assist in making their sugary volumes attractive, they were by no means"
730,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,quick to send him the money he had earned. He had only his annuity and a
731,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,few shillings gained by doing odd jobs for the farmers of the
732,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,neighbourhood. At this juncture Patty bore him a third child.
733,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
734,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"In 1828 CLARE went to London again at the invitation of Mrs. Emmerson,"
735,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,and it was then that he discovered how completely the “Shepherd’s
736,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Calendar” had failed to stir the interest of the public. It was during
737,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"this visit that Mr. Taylor, doubtless believing the open-air exercise"
738,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"would be most beneficial to the poet, suggested to CLARE the"
739,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,advisability of his attempting to dispose of his works by carrying them
740,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,from house to house in Northamptonshire and the adjoining counties.
741,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Allan Cunningham was furious at the idea, but in the end CLARE embraced"
742,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"it, though it had been better for him had he held the same opinion as"
743,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"his friend, for the adventure was prolific of more kicks than halfpence."
744,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,The history of this part of CLARE’S career makes very sad reading.
745,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Hungry and footsore he tramped from rebuff to rebuff, pondering misery"
746,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"and dreading the workhouse. But though the record of his travels is, for"
747,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"the most part, a document of disaster, there are a few proofs of"
748,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"kindliness contained in its pages. For example, when he returned to"
749,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Helpstone from Boston, where certain of the leading inhabitants had done"
750,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"their best to render him extremely uncomfortable, he found ten"
751,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,sovereigns in his wallet. A few young men had treated him as Joseph
752,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"treated his brethren. For three months after his experiences at Boston,"
753,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"CLARE was exceedingly ill, and it looked as if there was to be no ebbing"
754,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,of that tide of misfortune which had flowed in his direction for so
755,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"long. Better luck, however, was in store. CLARE got some regular work to"
756,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"do, and was thus prevented from poring over foolscap. Little by little"
757,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,he reduced his debts; his body throve in the sunshine of content; and he
758,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"was able to comfort himself with the belief that, after all, he would"
759,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,escape the degradation of becoming a pauper. Unfortunately a hard winter
760,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"followed the summer and autumn during which he had been so happy, and"
761,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,illness once more caused him to renew acquaintance with those bitter
762,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,familiars of his--want and despair. About this time he chanced to have a
763,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"conversation with Earl Fitzwilliam, with the result that his patron"
764,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,promised to build him a cottage somewhere near Helpstone. The exact
765,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"place decided upon by his lordship was Northborough, a hamlet three"
766,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,miles distant from Helpstone. This situation was chosen in a spirit of
767,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"kindness, the earl believing that the many natural beauties to be found"
768,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,almost at the door of the cottage would please the eye as well as
769,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,stimulate the genius of the poet. But the prospect of being severed from
770,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the bleak surroundings of his native place filled CLARE with sensations
771,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,of terror acute enough to make a severe effect upon his mind. For days
772,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"before the final wrench came he strode about the lanes and fields,"
773,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,outwardly exhibiting symptoms of a deranged intellect; but when the hour
774,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,for departure struck he allowed himself to be led to his new home as
775,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,placidly as a tired horse to the pasture. So far from proving a blessing
776,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"to CLARE, the cottage at Northborough was the immediate cause of fresh"
777,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,perplexities. Expenditure was necessary to furnish it and to keep it in
778,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,repair; debts were quickly piled one upon the other; among strangers it
779,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,was harder to obtain employment than it had been at Helpstone; and in
780,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the January of 1833 Patty bore her seventh child. At the thought that he
781,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,could scarcely provide his dear ones with bread enough to keep body and
782,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"soul together, CLARE, shortly after hearing the news of his boy’s birth,"
783,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,rushed out into the fields to give his sorrow vent. Late in the evening
784,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,his eldest daughter found him lying insensible on an embankment. A month
785,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"of bed followed this collapse. In the spring, although his vital forces"
786,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"were now sufficient to carry him in search of the early flowers, he"
787,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,showed no inclination to leave the little room where he kept his books
788,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"and papers. The irresistible magnets of former years--blossoms, birds,"
789,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,greenery and sunshine--had all lost their pulling power. CLARE himself
790,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"perceived that he was in danger of ceasing to be his own master, and"
791,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,accordingly wrote to Mr. Taylor begging him to secure Dr. Darling’s
792,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"help. In reply, his old publisher invited him to London. But the poet"
793,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,neither had money in his purse nor a single chance of raising the amount
794,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"necessary to defray the costs of the journey. Messrs. Whittaker & Co.,"
795,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"who were responsible for the appearance of the “Rural Muse,” declined"
796,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"to send him even a small sum on account, so that he was tied fast to"
797,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Northborough, where his mental malady had everything in its favour. Had"
798,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"it not been for the untiring exertions of Dr. Smith, of Peterborough,"
799,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"who mingled poetry and pills in his advice to patients, thus obtaining a"
800,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"goodly list of subscribers, it is doubtful whether the “Rural Muse”"
801,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,would have made its appearance before CLARE was overcome by permanent
802,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,imbecility. In the summer of 1835 this beautiful collection of rustic
803,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,reeds was put forward as a candidate for the affection of those
804,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,professing a love for music and wholesomeness in verse. The reception
805,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,accorded to the book proved conclusively what important parts fashion
806,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,and hypocrisy play in the concerns of the lyre. CLARE was out of vogue;
807,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,he was a stale lion; the parasites upon genius could no longer hope to
808,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,gain a temporary notoriety by displaying his peculiarities in their
809,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,saloons. The idea of reading poetry for the sake of poetry appears never
810,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"to have occurred to the members of a society as ponderable, in the"
811,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"matter of intellect, as thistledown, and as variable as the sheen of an"
812,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,opal. It is a moot point whether or no the reviewers wrote notices of
813,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"the “Rural Muse.” If they did their duty, the editors certainly did not"
814,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"back them up by granting space for the criticisms, for scarcely a"
815,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,paragraph of commendation saw the light. If CLARE did not fall among
816,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"thieves, he at least fell among blind bats. Literary England blotted her"
817,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"own escutcheon in this respect, but Scotland was saved from a similar"
818,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"disgrace by a noble outburst of praise for the poet, and scorn for his"
819,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"frigid countrymen, from the pen of Professor Wilson, in the course of"
820,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,which he adjured the Southrons to hold their tongues about the fate of
821,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Burns. Let them remember Bloomfield. Had he but known all the evil
822,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,circumstances which were combining to push JOHN CLARE in the direction
823,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"of a lunatic asylum, his retort would have been strengthened to a degree"
824,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,melancholy to contemplate.
825,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
826,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Mental derangement advanced upon CLARE with rapidity. In the spring of
827,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,1836 there was a brief period when the flowers made him a clear-minded
828,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"partaker of their magic, but the improvement was not maintained, and"
829,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"little by little the condition of the poet became more widley known,"
830,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,till at last it reached the ears of several patrons. These advised his
831,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"immediate removal to the asylum at Northampton, a plan to which Patty"
832,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"refused her consent, for she still had hopes that if her husband were"
833,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,allowed to range at his will and seek a cure from the pharmacy of
834,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"nature, he would beat the disease. But Patty’s love only delayed the"
835,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"inevitable. CLARE, it is true, escaped from the control suggested by"
836,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Earl Fitzwilliam, who endeavoured to place the poet at Northampton,"
837,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,where a weekly dole from the nobleman’s purse would secure for the
838,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,patient some additional comforts; but he had nowhither to fly from the
839,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,severe benefactions of the friends of former days. Mr. John Taylor and
840,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"others, willing to heed now that the catastrophe to which their silence"
841,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"had contributed was come by its full dimensions, clubbed together and"
842,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"sent CLARE to Dr. Allen’s private lunatic asylum in Epping Forest, where"
843,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,all the resources of a humane treatment were brought to bear upon his
844,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"case. He wrote a great quantity of verse, some of which was of real"
845,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,worth; tended the flowers in the garden beds; wandered about the woods
846,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"hour after hour, smoking, musing, or conversing with some companion. In"
847,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"the middle of July, 1841, he escaped, and eventually reached Werrington,"
848,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,a hamlet lying beyond Peterborough. His chief food had been grass; blood
849,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,was trickling from his feet when Patty took the wanderer into her arms
850,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"on the roadside at Werrington. After a day’s rest at Northborough, the"
851,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,poet asked for pen and ink. When these were supplied he commenced to
852,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,write his Odyssey. It is almost safe to say that no more extraordinary
853,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,a document belongs to the personal history of any genius born within our
854,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,boundaries. It is of a character to draw tears from the unsympathetic;
855,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"your Scrooge, your Quilp, could scarcely withstand its pathos. Well"
856,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,might Christopher North request us to be done with our comments upon
857,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Scotland’s usage of Burns!
858,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
859,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"The rest is soon told. CLARE, though quite harmless, was not allowed to"
860,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,pass free among the country sights and sounds. For some reason or other
861,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"he was haled to the Northampton General Lunatic Asylum, where he"
862,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"remained for twenty-two years, neglected alike by kindred, by friends,"
863,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,and by the educated mob which had once made an idol of him. At the
864,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Asylum he was treated with unvarying mildness by the authorities, who"
865,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,refused to regulate the comforts of the poet by the eleven shillings a
866,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,week supplied by Earl Fitzwilliam. That their natures were not
867,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"subservient to coinage they proved by placing CLARE--poor,"
868,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,eleven-shillings-a-week JOHN CLARE--among private patients in the best
869,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,ward.
870,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
871,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"The end came in 1864, and on the 25th of May in that year the mortal"
872,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"remnant of JOHN CLARE, peasant and poet, was interred at Helpstone. When"
873,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Earl Fitzwilliam was asked for a grant of the few pounds necessary for
874,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the burial of the poet in the churchyard so beloved by him during his
875,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"lifetime, he responded by suggesting that the funeral should be that of"
876,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"a pauper at Northampton. However, a few friends of the right heart"
877,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"prevented this disgrace, and the body rested where the soul had marked"
878,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,out for it a spot of greenery and quietude.
879,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,
880,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,That some of CLARE’S poems belong of right to the excellent things of
881,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"this earth admits of no dispute. A worshipper of Nature, by whom he was"
882,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"surely appointed to be one of her chief historians, he revelled in her"
883,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"manifestations, whether they showed in the higher heaven of blue or in"
884,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"the lower heaven of green. He was, if the phrases may pass muster, a"
885,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"gossip of the rainbow, a crony of the flowers. His heart was not less"
886,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,slow than that of Wordsworth to leap up with joy when he beheld standing
887,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"across the sky, its feet treading the horizon, the most splendid"
888,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,triumphal arch ever devised; and though it was not granted him to render
889,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,homage to his mistress in such large accents as those which fell from
890,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"the lips of his great brother in song, he paid for her love and favours"
891,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"in music far from perishable, as may be noted by all who will read the"
892,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,pieces that have been selected for this volume from the “Rural Muse.”
893,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"Who passes by any one of these poems because he early finds a flaw, does"
894,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"so at his own danger, for each of them belongs, as I venture to assert,"
895,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,so indubitably to the particular treasures of pastoral poetry that I
896,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,doubt whether the contradiction of our greatest critics could frighten
897,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,me from the attitude of admiration. To influences other than those of
898,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"the countryside, CLARE remained unimpressionable. To be in London was to"
899,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"long for Helpstone, the commons and pools of which were more precious to"
900,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"the poet than all the glories of Westminster Abbey, and the expanses of"
901,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,the artificial lakes. While he sojourned in the Metropolis the right
902,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"spark would not fall from heaven, but as soon as he wandered once more"
903,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"among the scenes so long familiar to him, the Muse was his unfailing"
904,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,companion. Brooks glided in his songs; birds and clouds and leafage were
905,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,foundations without which he had been well-nigh powerless. He
906,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"understood, and was content with, his limits; and so perfectly did he"
907,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"accomplish his duty as Nature’s cherished amanuensis, that it is no hard"
908,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,task for a man with an ounce of imagination in his being to hear the
909,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"trickle of streams, and to fancy his study carpeted with grass, while"
910,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,reading JOHN CLARE’S poems within four walls. As this volume of
911,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,selections is designed for the purpose of attracting readers to a poet
912,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,whose appreciative receipts from his posterity are sadly deficient in
913,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"quantity, the publisher has thought well to ask from me the tale of"
914,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"CLARE’S life, rather than my views of the poet’s work and its effect"
915,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,upon his successors in the production of poetry dealing almost
916,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,exclusively with the vowels and consonants in Nature’s mighty alphabet.
917,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,Enough has been said to prove the writer no half-hearted advocate; and
918,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"if these few pages serve to increase the number of CLARE’S friends, he"
919,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"will be more than satisfied, happy in the thought that he has been the"
920,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"means of introducing readers to poetry as gentle as it is healing, as"
921,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,"simple as it is sincere. Touching its wholesomeness, how could it fail"
922,BIOGRAPHY AND COMMENT,to delight in this respect when the chief of its constituent parts were

933,WHAT IS LIFE?,
934,WHAT IS LIFE?,
935,WHAT IS LIFE?,"And what is Life?--An hour-glass on the run,"
936,WHAT IS LIFE?,"A mist retreating from the morning sun,"
937,WHAT IS LIFE?,"A busy, bustling, still repeated dream.--"
938,WHAT IS LIFE?,"Its length?--A minute’s pause, a moment’s thought."
939,WHAT IS LIFE?,"And happiness?--A bubble on the stream,"
940,WHAT IS LIFE?,That in the act of seizing shrinks to nought.
941,WHAT IS LIFE?,
942,WHAT IS LIFE?,"What is vain Hope?--The puffing gale of morn,"
943,WHAT IS LIFE?,"That robs each flow’ret of its gem,--and dies;"
944,WHAT IS LIFE?,"A cobweb hiding disappointment’s thorn,"
945,WHAT IS LIFE?,Which stings more keenly through the thin disguise.
946,WHAT IS LIFE?,
947,WHAT IS LIFE?,"--And thou, O Trouble?--nothing can suppose"
948,WHAT IS LIFE?,"(And sure the Power of Wisdom only knows),"
949,WHAT IS LIFE?,What need requireth thee:
950,WHAT IS LIFE?,"So free and liberal as thy bounty flows,"
951,WHAT IS LIFE?,Some necessary cause must surely be.
952,WHAT IS LIFE?,"But disappointments, pains, and every woe"
953,WHAT IS LIFE?,"Devoted wretches feel,"
954,WHAT IS LIFE?,"The universal plagues of life below,"
955,WHAT IS LIFE?,Are mysteries still ’neath Fate’s unbroken seal.
956,WHAT IS LIFE?,
957,WHAT IS LIFE?,And what is Death? is still the cause unfound?
958,WHAT IS LIFE?,"That dark, mysterious name of horrid sound?--"
959,WHAT IS LIFE?,"A long and lingering sleep, the weary crave."
960,WHAT IS LIFE?,And Peace? where can its happiness abound?--
961,WHAT IS LIFE?,"No where at all, save heaven, and the grave."
962,WHAT IS LIFE?,
963,WHAT IS LIFE?,"Then what is Life?--When stripp’d of its disguise,"
964,WHAT IS LIFE?,A thing to be desir’d it cannot be;
965,WHAT IS LIFE?,Since every thing that meets our foolish eyes
966,WHAT IS LIFE?,Gives proof sufficient of its vanity.
967,WHAT IS LIFE?,’Tis but a trial all must undergo;
968,WHAT IS LIFE?,To teach unthankful mortals how to prize
969,WHAT IS LIFE?,"That happiness vain man’s denied to know,"
970,WHAT IS LIFE?,Until he’s call’d to claim it in the skies.

978,IN WINTER,
979,IN WINTER,
980,IN WINTER,"O thou Bliss! to riches known,"
981,IN WINTER,Stranger to the poor alone;
982,IN WINTER,"Giving most where none’s requir’d,"
983,IN WINTER,Leaving none where most’s desir’d;
984,IN WINTER,"Who, sworn friend to miser, keeps"
985,IN WINTER,Adding to his useless heaps
986,IN WINTER,"Gifts on gifts, profusely stor’d,"
987,IN WINTER,Till thousands swell the mouldy hoard:
988,IN WINTER,"While poor, shatter’d Poverty,"
989,IN WINTER,"To advantage seen in me,"
990,IN WINTER,"With his rags, his wants, and pain,"
991,IN WINTER,"Waking pity but in vain,"
992,IN WINTER,"Bowing, cringing at thy side,"
993,IN WINTER,"Begs his mite, and is denied."
994,IN WINTER,"O, thou blessing! let not me"
995,IN WINTER,"Tell, as vain, my wants to thee;"
996,IN WINTER,"Thou, by name of Plenty stil’d"
997,IN WINTER,"Fortune’s heir, her favourite child."
998,IN WINTER,"’Tis a maxim--hunger feed,"
999,IN WINTER,Give the needy when they need;
1000,IN WINTER,"He, whom all profess to serve,"
1001,IN WINTER,The same maxim did observe:
1002,IN WINTER,"Their obedience here, how well,"
1003,IN WINTER,Modern times will plainly tell.
1004,IN WINTER,"Hear my wants, nor deem me bold,"
1005,IN WINTER,Not without occasion told:
1006,IN WINTER,Hear one wish; nor fail to give;
1007,IN WINTER,"Use me well, and bid me live."
1008,IN WINTER,
1009,IN WINTER,"’Tis not great, what I solicit:"
1010,IN WINTER,"Was it more, thou couldst not miss it:"
1011,IN WINTER,"Now the cutting Winter’s come,"
1012,IN WINTER,"’Tis but just to find a home,"
1013,IN WINTER,"In some shelter, dry and warm,"
1014,IN WINTER,That will shield me from the storm.
1015,IN WINTER,"Toiling in the naked fields,"
1016,IN WINTER,"Where no bush a shelter yields,"
1017,IN WINTER,"Needy Labour dithering stands,"
1018,IN WINTER,Beats and blows his numbing hands;
1019,IN WINTER,And upon the crumping snows
1020,IN WINTER,"Stamps, in vain, to warm his toes."
1021,IN WINTER,"Leaves are fled, that once had power"
1022,IN WINTER,To resist a summer shower;
1023,IN WINTER,"And the wind so piercing blows,"
1024,IN WINTER,"Winnowing small the drifting snows,"
1025,IN WINTER,The summer shade of loaded bough
1026,IN WINTER,Would vainly boast a shelter now:
1027,IN WINTER,"Piercing snows so searching fall,"
1028,IN WINTER,They sift a passage through them all.
1029,IN WINTER,"Though all’s vain to keep him warm,"
1030,IN WINTER,Poverty must brave the storm.
1031,IN WINTER,"Friendship none, its aid to lend:"
1032,IN WINTER,Health alone his only friend;
1033,IN WINTER,"Granting leave to live in pain,"
1034,IN WINTER,Giving strength to toil in vain;
1035,IN WINTER,"To be, while winter’s horrors last,"
1036,IN WINTER,The sport of every pelting blast.
1037,IN WINTER,
1038,IN WINTER,"Oh, sad sons of Poverty!"
1039,IN WINTER,Victims doom’d to misery;
1040,IN WINTER,Who can paint what pain prevails
1041,IN WINTER,O’er that heart which Want assails?
1042,IN WINTER,Modest Shame the pain conceals:
1043,IN WINTER,"No one knows, but he who feels."
1044,IN WINTER,O thou charm which Plenty crowns:
1045,IN WINTER,"Fortune! smile, now Winter frowns:"
1046,IN WINTER,Cast around a pitying eye!
1047,IN WINTER,"Feed the hungry, ere they die."
1048,IN WINTER,"Think, oh! think upon the poor,"
1049,IN WINTER,Nor against them shut thy door:
1050,IN WINTER,"Freely let thy bounty flow,"
1051,IN WINTER,On the sons of Want and Woe.
1052,IN WINTER,
1053,IN WINTER,Hills and dales no more are seen
1054,IN WINTER,In their dress of pleasing green;
1055,IN WINTER,"Summer’s robes are all thrown by,"
1056,IN WINTER,For the clothing of the sky;
1057,IN WINTER,"Snows on snows in heaps combine,"
1058,IN WINTER,"Hillocks, rais’d as mountains, shine,"
1059,IN WINTER,"And at distance rising proud,"
1060,IN WINTER,Each appears a fleecy cloud.
1061,IN WINTER,Plenty! now thy gifts bestow;
1062,IN WINTER,Exit bid to every woe:
1063,IN WINTER,"Take me in, shut out the blast,"
1064,IN WINTER,Make the doors and windows fast;
1065,IN WINTER,"Place me in some corner, where,"
1066,IN WINTER,"Lolling in an elbow chair,"
1067,IN WINTER,"Happy, blest to my desire,"
1068,IN WINTER,I may find a rouzing fire;
1069,IN WINTER,"While in chimney-corner nigh,"
1070,IN WINTER,"Coal or wood, a fresh supply,"
1071,IN WINTER,"Ready stands for laying on,"
1072,IN WINTER,Soon as t’other’s burnt and gone.
1073,IN WINTER,"Now and then, as taste decreed"
1074,IN WINTER,In a book a page I’d read;
1075,IN WINTER,"And, inquiry to amuse,"
1076,IN WINTER,Peep at something in the news;
1077,IN WINTER,"See who’s married, and who’s dead,"
1078,IN WINTER,"And who, through bankrupt, beg their bread:"
1079,IN WINTER,"While on hob, or table nigh,"
1080,IN WINTER,"Just to drink before I’m dry,"
1081,IN WINTER,"A pitcher at my side should stand,"
1082,IN WINTER,"With the barrel nigh at hand,"
1083,IN WINTER,"Always ready as I will’d,"
1084,IN WINTER,"When ’twas empty, to be fill’d;"
1085,IN WINTER,"And, to be possess’d of all,"
1086,IN WINTER,"A corner cupboard in the wall,"
1087,IN WINTER,"With store of victuals lin’d complete,"
1088,IN WINTER,That when hungry I might eat.
1089,IN WINTER,"Then would I, in Plenty’s lap,"
1090,IN WINTER,For the first time take a nap;
1091,IN WINTER,"Falling back in easy lair,"
1092,IN WINTER,Sweetly slumbering in my chair;
1093,IN WINTER,With no reflective thoughts to wake
1094,IN WINTER,"Pains that cause my heart to ache,"
1095,IN WINTER,"Of contracted debts, long made,"
1096,IN WINTER,In no prospect to be paid;
1097,IN WINTER,"And, to Want, sad news severe,"
1098,IN WINTER,Of provisions getting dear:
1099,IN WINTER,"While the Winter, shocking sight,"
1100,IN WINTER,"Constant freezes day and night,"
1101,IN WINTER,"Deep and deeper falls the snow,"
1102,IN WINTER,"Labour’s slack, and wages low."
1103,IN WINTER,"These, and more, the poor can tell,"
1104,IN WINTER,"Known, alas, by them too well,"
1105,IN WINTER,"Plenty! oh, if blest by thee,"
1106,IN WINTER,Never more should trouble me.
1107,IN WINTER,"Hours and weeks will sweetly glide,"
1108,IN WINTER,"Soft and smooth as flows the tide,"
1109,IN WINTER,Where no stones or choaking grass
1110,IN WINTER,Force a curve ere it can pass:
1111,IN WINTER,"And as happy, and as blest,"
1112,IN WINTER,"As beasts drop them down to rest,"
1113,IN WINTER,"When in pastures, at their will,"
1114,IN WINTER,They have roam’d and eat their fill;
1115,IN WINTER,"Soft as nights in summer creep,"
1116,IN WINTER,So should I then fall asleep;
1117,IN WINTER,"While sweet visions of delight,"
1118,IN WINTER,"So enchanting to the sight,"
1119,IN WINTER,"Sweetly swimming o’er my eyes,"
1120,IN WINTER,Would sink me into extacies.
1121,IN WINTER,"Nor would pleasure’s dream once more,"
1122,IN WINTER,"As they oft have done before,"
1123,IN WINTER,"Cause be to create a pain,"
1124,IN WINTER,"When I woke, to find them vain:"
1125,IN WINTER,"Bitter past, the present sweet,"
1126,IN WINTER,Would my happiness complete.
1127,IN WINTER,"Oh; how easy should I lie,"
1128,IN WINTER,"With the fire up-blazing high,"
1129,IN WINTER,"(Summer’s artificial bloom,)"
1130,IN WINTER,"That like an oven keeps the room,"
1131,IN WINTER,"Or lovely May, as mild and warm:"
1132,IN WINTER,"While, without, the raging storm"
1133,IN WINTER,"Is roaring in the chimney-top,"
1134,IN WINTER,In no likelihood to drop;
1135,IN WINTER,"And the witchen-branches nigh,"
1136,IN WINTER,"O’er my snug box towering high,"
1137,IN WINTER,"That sweet shelter’d stands beneath,"
1138,IN WINTER,In convulsive eddies wreathe.
1139,IN WINTER,"Then while, tyrant-like, the storm"
1140,IN WINTER,Takes delight in doing harm.
1141,IN WINTER,"Down before him crushing all,"
1142,IN WINTER,Till his weapons useless fall;
1143,IN WINTER,And as in oppression proud
1144,IN WINTER,"Peal his howlings long and loud,"
1145,IN WINTER,"While the clouds, with horrid sweep,"
1146,IN WINTER,Give (as suits a tyrant’s trade)
1147,IN WINTER,"The sun a minute’s leave to peep,"
1148,IN WINTER,To smile upon the ruin’s made;
1149,IN WINTER,"And to make complete the blast,"
1150,IN WINTER,"While the hail comes hard and fast,"
1151,IN WINTER,Rattling loud against the glass;
1152,IN WINTER,"And the snowy sleets, that pass,"
1153,IN WINTER,Driving up in heaps remain
1154,IN WINTER,"Close adhering to the pane,"
1155,IN WINTER,"Stop the light and spread a gloom,"
1156,IN WINTER,"Suiting sleep, around the room:--"
1157,IN WINTER,"Oh, how blest ’mid these alarms,"
1158,IN WINTER,"I should bask in Fortune’s arms,"
1159,IN WINTER,"Who, defying every frown,"
1160,IN WINTER,"Hugs me on her drowny breast,"
1161,IN WINTER,"Bids my head lie easy down,"
1162,IN WINTER,And on Winter’s ruins rest.
1163,IN WINTER,"So upon the troubled sea,"
1164,IN WINTER,"Emblematic simile,"
1165,IN WINTER,"Birds are known to sit secure,"
1166,IN WINTER,"While the billows roar and rave,"
1167,IN WINTER,"Slumbering in their safety sure,"
1168,IN WINTER,Rock’d to sleep upon the wave.
1169,IN WINTER,"So would I still slumber on,"
1170,IN WINTER,"Till hour-telling clocks had gone,"
1171,IN WINTER,"And, from the contracted day,"
1172,IN WINTER,One or more had click’d away.
1173,IN WINTER,"Then with sitting wearied out,"
1174,IN WINTER,"I for change’s sake, no doubt,"
1175,IN WINTER,"Just might wish to leave my seat,"
1176,IN WINTER,"And, to exercise my feet,"
1177,IN WINTER,"Make a journey to the door,"
1178,IN WINTER,"Put my nose out, but no more:"
1179,IN WINTER,There to village taste agree;
1180,IN WINTER,Mark how times are like to be;
1181,IN WINTER,How the weather’s getting on;
1182,IN WINTER,Peep in ruts where carts have gone;
1183,IN WINTER,"Or, by stones, a sturdy stroke,"
1184,IN WINTER,"View the hole the boys have broke,"
1185,IN WINTER,"Crizzling, still inclin’d to freeze;--"
1186,IN WINTER,And the rime upon the trees.
1187,IN WINTER,"Then to pause on ills to come,"
1188,IN WINTER,Just look upward on the gloom;
1189,IN WINTER,"See fresh storms approaching fast,"
1190,IN WINTER,"View them busy in the air,"
1191,IN WINTER,"Boiling up the brewing blast,"
1192,IN WINTER,Still fresh horrors scheming there.
1193,IN WINTER,"Black and dismal, rising high,"
1194,IN WINTER,From the north they fright the eye:
1195,IN WINTER,"Pregnant with a thousand storms,"
1196,IN WINTER,"Huddled in their icy arms,"
1197,IN WINTER,"Heavy hovering as they come,"
1198,IN WINTER,Some as mountains seem--and some
1199,IN WINTER,Jagg’d as craggy rocks appear
1200,IN WINTER,Dismally advancing near:
1201,IN WINTER,"Fancy, at the cumbrous sight,"
1202,IN WINTER,"Chills and shudders with affright,"
1203,IN WINTER,"Fearing lest the air, in vain,"
1204,IN WINTER,"Strive her station to maintain,"
1205,IN WINTER,"And wearied, yeilding to the skies,"
1206,IN WINTER,The world beneath in ruin lies.
1207,IN WINTER,So may Fancy think and feign;
1208,IN WINTER,Fancy oft imagines vain:
1209,IN WINTER,"Nature’s laws, by wisdom penn’d,"
1210,IN WINTER,Mortals cannot comprehend;
1211,IN WINTER,"Power almighty Being gave,"
1212,IN WINTER,Endless Mercy stoops to save;
1213,IN WINTER,"Causes, hid from mortals’ sight,"
1214,IN WINTER,"Prove “whatever is, is right.”"
1215,IN WINTER,
1216,IN WINTER,"Then to look again below,"
1217,IN WINTER,"Labour’s former life I’d view,"
1218,IN WINTER,"Who, still beating through the snow,"
1219,IN WINTER,"Spite of storms their toils pursue,"
1220,IN WINTER,Forc’d out by sad Necessity
1221,IN WINTER,That sad fiend that forces me.
1222,IN WINTER,"Troubles, then no more my own,"
1223,IN WINTER,"Which I but too long had known,"
1224,IN WINTER,"Might create a care, a pain;"
1225,IN WINTER,Then I’d seek my joys again:
1226,IN WINTER,"Pile the fire up, fetch a drink,"
1227,IN WINTER,Then sit down again and think;
1228,IN WINTER,"Pause on all my sorrows past,"
1229,IN WINTER,"Think how many a bitter blast,"
1230,IN WINTER,"When it snow’d, and hail’d, and blew,"
1231,IN WINTER,I have toil’d and batter’d through.
1232,IN WINTER,"Then to ease reflective pain,"
1233,IN WINTER,"To my sports I’d fall again,"
1234,IN WINTER,Till the clock had counted ten;
1235,IN WINTER,"When I’d seek my downy bed,"
1236,IN WINTER,"Easy, happy, and well fed."
1237,IN WINTER,
1238,IN WINTER,"Then might peep the morn, in vain,"
1239,IN WINTER,Through the rimy misted pane;
1240,IN WINTER,"Then might bawl the restless cock,"
1241,IN WINTER,And the loud-tongued village clock;
1242,IN WINTER,"And the flail might lump away,"
1243,IN WINTER,Waking soon the dreary day:
1244,IN WINTER,"They should never waken me,"
1245,IN WINTER,"Independent, blest, and free;"
1246,IN WINTER,"Nor, as usual, make me start,"
1247,IN WINTER,"Yawning sigh with heavy heart,"
1248,IN WINTER,"Loth to ope my sleepy eyes,"
1249,IN WINTER,"Weary still, in pain to rise,"
1250,IN WINTER,"With aching bones and heavy head,"
1251,IN WINTER,Worse than when I went to bed.
1252,IN WINTER,"With nothing then to raise a sigh,"
1253,IN WINTER,"Oh, how happy should I lie"
1254,IN WINTER,"Till the clock was eight, or more,"
1255,IN WINTER,Then proceed as heretofore.
1256,IN WINTER,Best of blessings! sweetest charm!
1257,IN WINTER,Boon these wishes while they’re warm;
1258,IN WINTER,My fairy visions ne’er despise;
1259,IN WINTER,"As reason thinks, thou realize:"
1260,IN WINTER,Depress’d with want and poverty
1261,IN WINTER,"I sink, I fall, denied by thee."

1270,NOON,Nothing heard but yonder mill:
1271,NOON,While the dazzled eye surveys
1272,NOON,All around a liquid blaze;
1273,NOON,"And amid the scorching gleams,"
1274,NOON,"If we earnest look, it seems"
1275,NOON,As if crooked bits of glass
1276,NOON,Seem’d repeatedly to pass.
1277,NOON,"Oh, for a puffing breeze to blow!"
1278,NOON,But breezes are all strangers now;
1279,NOON,"Not a twig is seen to shake,"
1280,NOON,Nor the smallest bent to quake;
1281,NOON,From the river’s muddy side
1282,NOON,Not a curve is seen to glide;
1283,NOON,And no longer on the stream
1284,NOON,"Watching lies the silver bream,"
1285,NOON,"Forcing, from repeated springs,"
1286,NOON,“Verges in successive rings.”
1287,NOON,"Bees are faint, and cease to hum;"
1288,NOON,Birds are overpower’d and dumb.
1289,NOON,"Rural voices all are mute,"
1290,NOON,Tuneless lie the pipe and flute:
1291,NOON,"Shepherds, with their panting sheep,"
1292,NOON,In the swaliest corner creep;
1293,NOON,And from the tormenting heat
1294,NOON,All are wishing to retreat.
1295,NOON,"Huddled up in grass and flowers,"
1296,NOON,Mowers wait for cooler hours;
1297,NOON,"And the cow-boy seeks the sedge,"
1298,NOON,"Ramping in the woodland hedge,"
1299,NOON,While his cattle o’er the vales
1300,NOON,"Scamper, with uplifted tails;"
1301,NOON,"Others not so wild and mad,"
1302,NOON,"That can better bear the gad,"
1303,NOON,"Underneath the hedge-row lunge,"
1304,NOON,"Or, if nigh, in waters plunge."
1305,NOON,"Oh! to see how flowers are took,"
1306,NOON,How it grieves me when I look:
1307,NOON,"Ragged-robins, once so pink,"
1308,NOON,"Now are turn’d as black as ink,"
1309,NOON,"And the leaves, being scorch’d so much,"
1310,NOON,Even crumble at the touch;
1311,NOON,"Drowking lies the meadow-sweet,"
1312,NOON,Flopping down beneath one’s feet
1313,NOON,"While to all the flowers that blow,"
1314,NOON,"If in open air they grow,"
1315,NOON,Th’ injurious deed alike is done
1316,NOON,By the hot relentless sun.
1317,NOON,E’en the dew is parched up
1318,NOON,From the teasel’s jointed cup:
1319,NOON,"O poor birds! where must ye fly,"
1320,NOON,Now your water-pots are dry?
1321,NOON,"If ye stay upon the heath,"
1322,NOON,Ye’ll be choak’d and clamm’d to death:
1323,NOON,"Therefore leave the shadeless goss,"
1324,NOON,Seek the spring-head lin’d with moss;
1325,NOON,"There your little feet may stand,"
1326,NOON,Safely printing on the sand;
1327,NOON,"While, in full possession, where"
1328,NOON,"Purling eddies ripple clear,"
1329,NOON,"You with ease and plenty blest,"
1330,NOON,Sip the coolest and the best.
1331,NOON,Then away! and wet your throats;
1332,NOON,Cheer me with your warbling notes:
1333,NOON,T’will hot noon the more revive;
1334,NOON,While I wander to contrive
1335,NOON,"For myself a place as good,"
1336,NOON,In the middle of a wood:
1337,NOON,"There aside some mossy bank,"
1338,NOON,Where the grass in bunches rank
1339,NOON,"Lifts its down on spindles high,"
1340,NOON,Shall be where I’ll choose to lie;
1341,NOON,"Fearless of the things that creep,"
1342,NOON,"There I’ll think, and there I’ll sleep;"
1343,NOON,"Caring not to stir at all,"
1344,NOON,Till the dew begins to fall.

1370,THE HARVEST MORNING,"The labouring rustic hears his restless foe,"
1371,THE HARVEST MORNING,"And weary, of his pains complaining sore,"
1372,THE HARVEST MORNING,Hobbles to fetch his horses from the moor:
1373,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Some busy ’gin to teem the loaded corn,"
1374,THE HARVEST MORNING,Which night throng’d round the barn’s becrowded door;
1375,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Such plenteous scenes the farmer’s yard adorn,"
1376,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Such noisy, busy toils now mark the Harvest Morn."
1377,THE HARVEST MORNING,
1378,THE HARVEST MORNING,The bird-boy’s pealing horn is loudly blow’d;
1379,THE HARVEST MORNING,The waggons jostle on with rattling sound;
1380,THE HARVEST MORNING,"And hogs and geese now throng the dusty road,"
1381,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Grunting, and gabbling, in contention, round"
1382,THE HARVEST MORNING,The barley ears that litter on the ground.
1383,THE HARVEST MORNING,What printing traces mark the waggon’s way;
1384,THE HARVEST MORNING,What busy bustling wakens echo round;
1385,THE HARVEST MORNING,How drive the sun’s warm beams the mist away;
1386,THE HARVEST MORNING,"How labour sweats and toils, and dreads the sultry day!"
1387,THE HARVEST MORNING,
1388,THE HARVEST MORNING,"His scythe the mower o’er his shoulder leans,"
1389,THE HARVEST MORNING,"And whetting, jars with sharp and tinkling sound;"
1390,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Then sweeps again ’mong corn and crackling beans,"
1391,THE HARVEST MORNING,And swath by swath flops lengthening o’er the ground;
1392,THE HARVEST MORNING,"While ’neath some friendly heap, snug shelter’d round"
1393,THE HARVEST MORNING,"From spoiling sun, lies hid the heart’s delight;"
1394,THE HARVEST MORNING,"And hearty soaks oft hand the bottle round,"
1395,THE HARVEST MORNING,Their toils pursuing with redoubled might--
1396,THE HARVEST MORNING,Great praise to him is due that brought its birth to light.
1397,THE HARVEST MORNING,
1398,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Upon the waggon now, with eager bound,"
1399,THE HARVEST MORNING,The lusty picker whirls the rustling sheaves;
1400,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Or, resting ponderous creaking fork aground,"
1401,THE HARVEST MORNING,Boastful at once whole shocks of barley heaves:
1402,THE HARVEST MORNING,The loading boy revengeful inly grieves
1403,THE HARVEST MORNING,To find his unmatch’d strength and power decay;
1404,THE HARVEST MORNING,The barley horn his garments interweaves;
1405,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Smarting and sweating ’neath the sultry day,"
1406,THE HARVEST MORNING,"With muttering curses stung, he mauls the heaps away."
1407,THE HARVEST MORNING,
1408,THE HARVEST MORNING,A motley group the clearing field surround;
1409,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Sons of Humanity, oh ne’er deny"
1410,THE HARVEST MORNING,The humble gleaner entrance in your ground;
1411,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Winter’s sad cold, and Poverty are nigh."
1412,THE HARVEST MORNING,Grudge not from Providence the scant supply:
1413,THE HARVEST MORNING,You’ll never miss it from your ample store.
1414,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Who gives denial--harden’d, hungry hound,--"
1415,THE HARVEST MORNING,May never blessings crowd his hated door!
1416,THE HARVEST MORNING,"But he shall never lack, that giveth to the poor."
1417,THE HARVEST MORNING,
1418,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Ah, lovely Emma! mingling with the rest,"
1419,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Thy beauties blooming in low life unseen,"
1420,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Thy rosy cheeks, thy sweetly swelling breast;"
1421,THE HARVEST MORNING,But ill it suits thee in the stubs to glean.
1422,THE HARVEST MORNING,O Poverty! how basely you demean
1423,THE HARVEST MORNING,The imprison’d worth your rigid fates confine:
1424,THE HARVEST MORNING,Not fancied charms of an Arcadian queen
1425,THE HARVEST MORNING,So sweet as Emma’s real beauties shine:
1426,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Had Fortune blest, sweet girl, this lot had ne’er been thine."
1427,THE HARVEST MORNING,
1428,THE HARVEST MORNING,"The sun’s increasing heat now mounted high,"
1429,THE HARVEST MORNING,Refreshment must recruit exhausted power;
1430,THE HARVEST MORNING,"The waggon stops, the busy tool’s thrown by,"
1431,THE HARVEST MORNING,And ’neath a shock’s enjoy’d the bevering hour.
1432,THE HARVEST MORNING,"The bashful maid, sweet health’s engaging flower"
1433,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Lingering behind, o’er rake still blushing bends;"
1434,THE HARVEST MORNING,"And when to take the horn fond swains implore,"
1435,THE HARVEST MORNING,With feign’d excuses its dislike pretends.
1436,THE HARVEST MORNING,"So pass the bevering hours, so Harvest Morning ends."
1437,THE HARVEST MORNING,
1438,THE HARVEST MORNING,O Rural Life! what charms thy meanness hide;
1439,THE HARVEST MORNING,What sweet descriptions bards disdain to sing;
1440,THE HARVEST MORNING,"What loves, what graces on thy plains abide:"
1441,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Oh, could I soar me on the Muse’s wing,"
1442,THE HARVEST MORNING,What rifled charms should my researches bring!
1443,THE HARVEST MORNING,Pleas’d would I wander where these charms reside;
1444,THE HARVEST MORNING,Of rural sports and beauties would I sing;
1445,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Those beauties, Wealth, which you in vain deride,"
1446,THE HARVEST MORNING,"Beauties of richest bloom, superior to your pride."

1514,SUMMER EVENING,"The sinking sun is taking leave,"
1515,SUMMER EVENING,"And sweetly gilds the edge of Eve,"
1516,SUMMER EVENING,While huddling clouds of purple dye
1517,SUMMER EVENING,Gloomy hang the western sky.
1518,SUMMER EVENING,"Crows crowd croaking over-head,"
1519,SUMMER EVENING,Hastening to the woods to bed.
1520,SUMMER EVENING,"Cooing sits the lonely dove,"
1521,SUMMER EVENING,Calling home her absent love.
1522,SUMMER EVENING,"With “Kirchup! kirchup!” ’mong the wheats,"
1523,SUMMER EVENING,Partridge distant partridge greets;
1524,SUMMER EVENING,"Beckoning hints to those that roam,"
1525,SUMMER EVENING,That guide the squander’d covey home.
1526,SUMMER EVENING,"Swallows check their winding flight,"
1527,SUMMER EVENING,And twittering on the chimney light.
1528,SUMMER EVENING,"Round the pond the martins flirt,"
1529,SUMMER EVENING,"Their snowy breasts bedaub’d with dirt,"
1530,SUMMER EVENING,"While the mason, ’neath the slates,"
1531,SUMMER EVENING,Each mortar-bearing bird awaits:
1532,SUMMER EVENING,"By art untaught, each labouring spouse"
1533,SUMMER EVENING,Curious daubs his hanging house.
1534,SUMMER EVENING,Bats flit by in hood and cowl;
1535,SUMMER EVENING,Through the barn-hole pops the owl;
1536,SUMMER EVENING,"From the hedge, in drowsy hum,"
1537,SUMMER EVENING,"Heedless buzzing beetles bum,"
1538,SUMMER EVENING,"Haunting every bushy place,"
1539,SUMMER EVENING,Flopping in the labourer’s face.
1540,SUMMER EVENING,Now the snail hath made his ring;
1541,SUMMER EVENING,And the moth with snowy wing
1542,SUMMER EVENING,"Circles round in winding whirls,"
1543,SUMMER EVENING,Through sweet evening’s sprinkled pearls
1544,SUMMER EVENING,On each nodding rush besprent;
1545,SUMMER EVENING,Dancing on from bent to bent:

1548,SUMMER EVENING,"Strong to ferry o’er the stream,"
1549,SUMMER EVENING,Vanishing as flies a dream:
1550,SUMMER EVENING,"Playful still his hours to keep,"
1551,SUMMER EVENING,Till his time has come to sleep;
1552,SUMMER EVENING,"In tall grass, by fountain-head,"
1553,SUMMER EVENING,Weary then he drops to bed.
1554,SUMMER EVENING,From the hay-cock’s moisten’d heaps
1555,SUMMER EVENING,Startled frogs take vaunting leaps;
1556,SUMMER EVENING,"And along the shaven mead,"
1557,SUMMER EVENING,"Jumping travellers, they proceed:"
1558,SUMMER EVENING,"Quick the dewy grass divides,"
1559,SUMMER EVENING,Moistening sweet their speckled sides;
1560,SUMMER EVENING,"From the grass or flowret’s cup,"
1561,SUMMER EVENING,Quick the dew-drop bounces up.
1562,SUMMER EVENING,"Now the blue fog creeps along,"
1563,SUMMER EVENING,And the bird’s forgot his song:
1564,SUMMER EVENING,Flowers now sleep within their hoods;
1565,SUMMER EVENING,Daisies button into buds;
1566,SUMMER EVENING,From soiling dew the butter-cup
1567,SUMMER EVENING,Shuts his golden jewels up;
1568,SUMMER EVENING,And the rose and woodbine they
1569,SUMMER EVENING,Wait again the smiles of day.
1570,SUMMER EVENING,"’Neath the willow’s wavy boughs,"
1571,SUMMER EVENING,"Dolly, singing, milks hers cows;"
1572,SUMMER EVENING,"While the brook, as bubbling by,"
1573,SUMMER EVENING,Joins in murmuring melody.
1574,SUMMER EVENING,"Dick and Dob, with jostling joll,"
1575,SUMMER EVENING,Homeward drag the rumbling roll;
1576,SUMMER EVENING,"Whilom Ralph, for Doll to wait,"
1577,SUMMER EVENING,Lolls him o’er the pasture gate.
1578,SUMMER EVENING,Swains to fold their sheep begin;
1579,SUMMER EVENING,Dogs loud barking drive them in.
1580,SUMMER EVENING,Hedgers now along the road
1581,SUMMER EVENING,Homeward bend beneath their load;
1582,SUMMER EVENING,"And from the long furrow’d seams,"
1583,SUMMER EVENING,Ploughmen loose their weary teams:
1584,SUMMER EVENING,"Ball, with urging lashes weal’d."
1585,SUMMER EVENING,"Still so slow to drive a-field,"
1586,SUMMER EVENING,"Eager blundering from the plough,"
1587,SUMMER EVENING,Wants no whip to drive him now;
1588,SUMMER EVENING,"At the stable-door he stands,"
1589,SUMMER EVENING,Looking round for friendly hands
1590,SUMMER EVENING,"To loose the door its fast’ning pin,"
1591,SUMMER EVENING,And let him with his corn begin.
1592,SUMMER EVENING,"Round the yard, a thousand ways"
1593,SUMMER EVENING,"Beasts in expectation gaze,"
1594,SUMMER EVENING,Catching at the loads of hay
1595,SUMMER EVENING,Passing fodd’rers tug away.
1596,SUMMER EVENING,"Hogs with grumbling, deaf’ning noise"
1597,SUMMER EVENING,Bother round the server boys;
1598,SUMMER EVENING,"And, far and near, the motley group"
1599,SUMMER EVENING,Anxious claim their suppering-up.
1600,SUMMER EVENING,"From the rest, a blest release,"
1601,SUMMER EVENING,"Gabbling home, the quarrelling geese"
1602,SUMMER EVENING,"Seek their warm straw-litter’d shed,"
1603,SUMMER EVENING,"And, waddling, prate away to bed."
1604,SUMMER EVENING,"’Nighted by unseen delay,"
1605,SUMMER EVENING,"Poking hens, that lose their way,"
1606,SUMMER EVENING,"On the hovel’s rafters rise,"
1607,SUMMER EVENING,"Slumbering there, the fox’s prize."
1608,SUMMER EVENING,"Now the cat has ta’en her seat,"
1609,SUMMER EVENING,With her tail curl’d round her feet;
1610,SUMMER EVENING,Patiently she sits to watch
1611,SUMMER EVENING,Sparrows fighting on the thatch.
1612,SUMMER EVENING,Now Doll brings th’ expected pails.
1613,SUMMER EVENING,And dogs begin to wag their tails;
1614,SUMMER EVENING,With strokes and pats they’re welcom’d in
1615,SUMMER EVENING,And they with looking wants begin:
1616,SUMMER EVENING,"Slove in the milk-pail brimming o’er,"
1617,SUMMER EVENING,She pops their dish behind the door.
1618,SUMMER EVENING,"Prone to mischief boys are met,"
1619,SUMMER EVENING,"’Neath the eaves the ladder’s set,"
1620,SUMMER EVENING,"Sly they climb in softest tread,"
1621,SUMMER EVENING,"To catch the sparrow on his bed,"
1622,SUMMER EVENING,"Massacred, O cruel pride!"
1623,SUMMER EVENING,Dash against the ladder’s side.
1624,SUMMER EVENING,Curst barbarians! pass me by:
1625,SUMMER EVENING,"Come not, Turks, my cottage nigh;"
1626,SUMMER EVENING,"Sure my sparrow’s are my own,"
1627,SUMMER EVENING,Let ye then my birds alone.
1628,SUMMER EVENING,Come poor birds! from foes severe
1629,SUMMER EVENING,"Fearless come, you’re welcome here;"
1630,SUMMER EVENING,"My heart yearns at fate like yours,"
1631,SUMMER EVENING,A sparrow’s life’s as sweet as ours.
1632,SUMMER EVENING,Hardy clowns! grudge not the wheat
1633,SUMMER EVENING,Which hunger forces birds to eat:
1634,SUMMER EVENING,"Your blinded eyes, worst foes to you,"
1635,SUMMER EVENING,Can’t see the good which sparrows do.
1636,SUMMER EVENING,Did not poor birds with watching rounds
1637,SUMMER EVENING,"Pick up the insects from your grounds,"
1638,SUMMER EVENING,"Did they not tend your rising grain,"
1639,SUMMER EVENING,You might then sow to reap in vain.
1640,SUMMER EVENING,"Thus Providence, right understood,"
1641,SUMMER EVENING,"Whose end and aim is doing good,"
1642,SUMMER EVENING,Sends nothing here without its use;
1643,SUMMER EVENING,Though ignorance loads it with abuse;
1644,SUMMER EVENING,"And fools despise the blessing sent,"
1645,SUMMER EVENING,And mock the Giver’s good intent--
1646,SUMMER EVENING,"O God! let me what’s good pursue,"
1647,SUMMER EVENING,Let me the same to others do
1648,SUMMER EVENING,"As I’d have others do to me,"
1649,SUMMER EVENING,And learn at least humanity.
1650,SUMMER EVENING,
1651,SUMMER EVENING,Dark and darker glooms the sky;
1652,SUMMER EVENING,Sleep ’gins close the labourer’s eye:
1653,SUMMER EVENING,"Dobson leaves his greensward seat,"
1654,SUMMER EVENING,Neighbours where they neighbours meet
1655,SUMMER EVENING,"Crops to praise and work in hand,"
1656,SUMMER EVENING,And battles tell from foreign land.
1657,SUMMER EVENING,"While his pipe is puffing out,"
1658,SUMMER EVENING,"Sue he’s putting to the rout,"
1659,SUMMER EVENING,"Gossiping, who takes delight"
1660,SUMMER EVENING,"To shool her knitting out at night,"
1661,SUMMER EVENING,And back-bite neighbours ’bout the town--
1662,SUMMER EVENING,"Who’s got new caps, and who a gown,"
1663,SUMMER EVENING,"And many a thing, her evil eye"
1664,SUMMER EVENING,Can see they don’t come honest by.
1665,SUMMER EVENING,"Chattering at a neighbour’s house,"
1666,SUMMER EVENING,She hears call out her frowning spouse
1667,SUMMER EVENING,"Prepar’d to start, she soodles home,"
1668,SUMMER EVENING,"Her knitting twirling o’er her thumb,"
1669,SUMMER EVENING,"As, loth to leave, afraid to stay,"
1670,SUMMER EVENING,She bawls her story all the way:
1671,SUMMER EVENING,The tale so fraught with ’ticing charms.
1672,SUMMER EVENING,"Her apron folded o’er her arms,"
1673,SUMMER EVENING,"She leaves the unfinished tale, in pain,"
1674,SUMMER EVENING,To end as evening comes again;
1675,SUMMER EVENING,And in the cottage gangs with dread
1676,SUMMER EVENING,"To meet old Dobson’s timely frown,"
1677,SUMMER EVENING,"Who grumbling sits, prepar’d for bed,"
1678,SUMMER EVENING,While she stands chelping ’bout the town.
1679,SUMMER EVENING,
1680,SUMMER EVENING,"The night-wind now, with sooty wings,"
1681,SUMMER EVENING,In the cotter’s chimney sings;
1682,SUMMER EVENING,"Now, as stretching o’er the bed,"
1683,SUMMER EVENING,"Soft I raise my drowsy head,"
1684,SUMMER EVENING,Listening to the ushering charms
1685,SUMMER EVENING,That shake the elm tree’s mossy arms;
1686,SUMMER EVENING,"Till sweet slumbers stronger creep,"
1687,SUMMER EVENING,"Deeper darkness stealing round,"
1688,SUMMER EVENING,"Then, as rock’d, I sink to sleep,"
1689,SUMMER EVENING,’Mid the wild wind’s lulling sound.

1827,EFFUSION,"By summer burnt, or numb’d by winter’s blast,"
1828,EFFUSION,"Delving the ditch a livelihood to earn,"
1829,EFFUSION,Or lumping corn out in a dusty barn;
1830,EFFUSION,"With aching bones returning home at night,"
1831,EFFUSION,And sitting down with weary hand to write;
1832,EFFUSION,"Ah, little did I think, as then unknown,"
1833,EFFUSION,Those artless rhymes I even blush’d to own
1834,EFFUSION,"Would be one day applauded and approv’d,"
1835,EFFUSION,"By learning notic’d, and by genius lov’d."
1836,EFFUSION,"God knows, my hopes were many, but my pain"

1840,EFFUSION,"Hadst thou expression, thou couldst easy tell"

1842,EFFUSION,"’Twould be but sorrow’s tale, yet still ’twould be"
1843,EFFUSION,"A tale of truth, and passing sweet to me."
1844,EFFUSION,"How oft upon my hand I’ve laid my head,"
1845,EFFUSION,And thought how poverty deform’d our shed;
1846,EFFUSION,Look’d on each parent’s face I fain had cheer’d
1847,EFFUSION,"Where sorrow triumph’d, and pale want appear’d;"
1848,EFFUSION,"And sigh’d, and hop’d, and wish’d some day would come,"
1849,EFFUSION,"When I might bring a blessing to their home,--"
1850,EFFUSION,"That toil and merit comforts had in store,"

1852,EFFUSION,Who that has feelings would not wish to be
1853,EFFUSION,"A friend to parents, such as mine to me,"
1854,EFFUSION,"Who in distress broke their last crust in twain,"
1855,EFFUSION,"And though want pinch’d, the remnant broke again,"
1856,EFFUSION,"And still, if craving of their scanty bread,"
1857,EFFUSION,Gave their last mouthful that I might be fed?
1858,EFFUSION,"Nor for their own wants tear-drops follow’d free,"
1859,EFFUSION,"Worse anguish stung--they had no more for me,"
1860,EFFUSION,"And now hope’s sun is looking brighter out,"
1861,EFFUSION,"And spreading thin the clouds of fear and doubt,"
1862,EFFUSION,That long in gloomy sad suspense to me
1863,EFFUSION,Hid the long-waited smiles I wish’d to see.
1864,EFFUSION,"And now, my parents, helping you is sweet,--"
1865,EFFUSION,The rudest havoc fortune could complete;
1866,EFFUSION,"A piteous couple, little blest with friends,"
1867,EFFUSION,Where pain and poverty have had their ends.
1868,EFFUSION,"I’ll be thy crutch, my father, lean on me;"
1869,EFFUSION,Weakness knits stubborn while its bearing thee;
1870,EFFUSION,And hard shall fall the shock of fortune’s frown
1871,EFFUSION,"To eke thy sorrows, ere it breaks me down."
1872,EFFUSION,"My mother, too, thy kindness shall be met,"
1873,EFFUSION,And ere I’m able will I pay the debt;
1874,EFFUSION,"For what thou’st done, and what gone through for me,"
1875,EFFUSION,My last-earn’d sixpence will I break with thee:
1876,EFFUSION,"And when my dwindled sum won’t more divide,"
1877,EFFUSION,Then take it all--to fate I’ll leave the rest;
1878,EFFUSION,"In helping thee I’ll always feel a pride,"
1879,EFFUSION,Nor think I’m happy till ye both are blest.

2191,RURAL EVENING,
2192,RURAL EVENING,"The sun now sinks behind the woodland green,"
2193,RURAL EVENING,"And twittering spangles glow the leaves between,"
2194,RURAL EVENING,So bright and dazzling on the eye it plays
2195,RURAL EVENING,"As if noon’s heat had kindled to a blaze,"
2196,RURAL EVENING,"But soon it dims in red and heavier hues,"
2197,RURAL EVENING,And shows wild fancy cheated in her views.
2198,RURAL EVENING,"A mist-like moisture rises from the ground,"
2199,RURAL EVENING,And deeper blueness stains the distant round.
2200,RURAL EVENING,"The eye each moment, as it gazes o’er,"
2201,RURAL EVENING,Still loses objects which it mark’d before;
2202,RURAL EVENING,"The woods at distance changing like to clouds,"
2203,RURAL EVENING,And spire-points croodling under evening’s shrouds;
2204,RURAL EVENING,"Till forms of things, and hues of leaf and flower,"
2205,RURAL EVENING,"In deeper shadows, as by magic power,"
2206,RURAL EVENING,"With light and all, in scarce-perceiv’d decay,"
2207,RURAL EVENING,Put on mild evening’s sober garb of grey.
2208,RURAL EVENING,
2209,RURAL EVENING,Now in the sleepy gloom that blackens round
2210,RURAL EVENING,"Dies many a lulling hum of rural sound,"
2211,RURAL EVENING,"From cottage door, farm-yard and dusty lane,"
2212,RURAL EVENING,Where home the cart-house tolters with the swain.
2213,RURAL EVENING,"Or padded holm, where village boys resort,"
2214,RURAL EVENING,"Bawling enraptur’d o’er their evening sport,"
2215,RURAL EVENING,Till night awakens superstition’s dread
2216,RURAL EVENING,And drives them prisoners to a restless bed.
2217,RURAL EVENING,Thrice happy eve of days no more to me!
2218,RURAL EVENING,Whoever thought such change belong’d to thee?
2219,RURAL EVENING,"When, like to boys whom now thy gloom surrounds,"
2220,RURAL EVENING,"I chas’d the stag, or play’d at fox-and-hounds,"
2221,RURAL EVENING,Or wander’d down the lane with many a mate
2222,RURAL EVENING,"To play at see-saw on the pasture-gate,"
2223,RURAL EVENING,Or on the threshold of some cottage sat
2224,RURAL EVENING,"To watch the flittings of the shrieking bat,"
2225,RURAL EVENING,"Who, seemly pleas’d to mock our treacherous view,"
2226,RURAL EVENING,"Would even swoop and touch us as he flew,"
2227,RURAL EVENING,And vainly still our hopes to entertain
2228,RURAL EVENING,"Would stint his route, and circle us again,--"
2229,RURAL EVENING,"Till, wearied out with many a coaxing call"
2230,RURAL EVENING,"Which boyish superstition loves to bawl,"
2231,RURAL EVENING,"His shrill song shrieking he betook to flight,"
2232,RURAL EVENING,And left us puzzled in short-sighted night.
2233,RURAL EVENING,"Those days have fled me, as from them they steal:"
2234,RURAL EVENING,And I’ve felt losses they must shortly feel;
2235,RURAL EVENING,"But sure such ends make every bosom sore,"
2236,RURAL EVENING,To think of pleasures we must meet no more.
2237,RURAL EVENING,
2238,RURAL EVENING,"Now from the pasture milking-maidens come,"
2239,RURAL EVENING,"With each a swain to bear the burden home,"
2240,RURAL EVENING,Who often coax them on their pleasant way
2241,RURAL EVENING,To soodle longer out in love’s delay;
2242,RURAL EVENING,"While on a mole-hill, or a resting stile,"
2243,RURAL EVENING,The simple rustics try their arts the while
2244,RURAL EVENING,"With glegging smiles, and hopes and fears between,"
2245,RURAL EVENING,Snatching a kiss to open what they mean:
2246,RURAL EVENING,"And all the utmost that their tongues can do,"
2247,RURAL EVENING,"The honey’d words which nature learns to woo,"
2248,RURAL EVENING,"The wild-flower sweets of language, “love” and “dear,”"
2249,RURAL EVENING,With warmest utterings meet each maiden’s ear;
2250,RURAL EVENING,"Who as by magic smit, she knows not why,"
2251,RURAL EVENING,From the warm look that waits a wish’d reply
2252,RURAL EVENING,Droops fearful down in love’s delightful swoon
2253,RURAL EVENING,As slinks the blossom from the suns of noon;
2254,RURAL EVENING,"While sighs half-smother’d from the throbbing breast,"
2255,RURAL EVENING,"And broken words sweet trembling o’er the rest,"
2256,RURAL EVENING,"And cheeks, in blushes burning, turn’d aside,"
2257,RURAL EVENING,Betray the plainer what she strives to hide.
2258,RURAL EVENING,"The amorous swain sees through the feign’d disguise,"
2259,RURAL EVENING,"Discerns the fondness she at first denies,"
2260,RURAL EVENING,And with all passions love and truth can move
2261,RURAL EVENING,Urges more strong the simpering maid to love;
2262,RURAL EVENING,More freely using toying ways to win--
2263,RURAL EVENING,Tokens that echo from the soul within--
2264,RURAL EVENING,"Her soft hand nipping, that with ardour burns,"
2265,RURAL EVENING,"And, timid, gentlier presses its returns;"
2266,RURAL EVENING,"Then stealing pins with innocent deceit,"
2267,RURAL EVENING,To loose the ’kerchief from its envied seat;
2268,RURAL EVENING,"Then unawares her bonnet he’ll untie,"
2269,RURAL EVENING,"Her dark-brown ringlets wiping gently by,"
2270,RURAL EVENING,"To steal a kiss in seemly feign’d disguise,"
2271,RURAL EVENING,As love yields kinder taken by surprise:
2272,RURAL EVENING,"While nearly conquer’d she less disapproves,"
2273,RURAL EVENING,"And owns at last, mid tears and sighs, she loves."
2274,RURAL EVENING,With sweetest feelings that this world bestows
2275,RURAL EVENING,"Now each to each their inmost souls disclose,"
2276,RURAL EVENING,"Vow to be true; and to be truly ta’en,"
2277,RURAL EVENING,"Repeat their loves, and vow it o’er again;"
2278,RURAL EVENING,And pause at loss of language to proclaim
2279,RURAL EVENING,"Those purest pleasures, yet without a name:"
2280,RURAL EVENING,"And while, in highest ecstacy of bliss"
2281,RURAL EVENING,The shepherd holds her yielding hand in his
2282,RURAL EVENING,"He turns to heaven to witness what he feels,"
2283,RURAL EVENING,And silent shows what want of words conceals;
2284,RURAL EVENING,"Then ere the parting moments hustle nigh,"
2285,RURAL EVENING,"And night in deeper dye his curtain dips,"
2286,RURAL EVENING,"Till next day’s evening glads the anxious eye,"
2287,RURAL EVENING,"He swears his truth, and seals it on her lips."
2288,RURAL EVENING,
2289,RURAL EVENING,"At even’s hour, the truce of toil, ’tis sweet"
2290,RURAL EVENING,"The sons of labour at their ease to meet,"
2291,RURAL EVENING,"On piled bench, beside the cottage door,"
2292,RURAL EVENING,Made up of mud and stones and sodded o’er;
2293,RURAL EVENING,Where rustic taste at leisure trimly weaves
2294,RURAL EVENING,"The rose and straggling woodbine to the eaves,--"
2295,RURAL EVENING,And on the crowded spot that pales enclose
2296,RURAL EVENING,"The white and scarlet daisy rears in rows,--"
2297,RURAL EVENING,"Training the trailing peas in bunches neat,"
2298,RURAL EVENING,"Perfuming evening with a luscious sweet,--"
2299,RURAL EVENING,"And sun-flowers planting for their gilded show,"
2300,RURAL EVENING,"That scale the window’s lattice ere they blow,"
2301,RURAL EVENING,"Then sweet to habitants within the sheds,"
2302,RURAL EVENING,Peep through the diamond pane their golden heads:
2303,RURAL EVENING,"Or at the shop where ploughs and harrows lie,"
2304,RURAL EVENING,Well-known to every child that passes by
2305,RURAL EVENING,From shining fragments littering on the floor;
2306,RURAL EVENING,"And branded letter burnt upon the door,"
2307,RURAL EVENING,"Where meddling boys, the torment of the street,"
2308,RURAL EVENING,"In hard-burnt cinders ready weapons meet,"
2309,RURAL EVENING,To pelt the martins ’neath the eves at rest
2310,RURAL EVENING,That oft are wak’d to mourn a ruin’d nest;
2311,RURAL EVENING,"Or sparrows, that delight their nests to leave,"
2312,RURAL EVENING,In dust to flutter at the cool of eve.
2313,RURAL EVENING,"For such-like scenes the gossip leaves her home,"
2314,RURAL EVENING,"And sons of labour light their pipes, and come"
2315,RURAL EVENING,"To talk of wages, whether high or low,"
2316,RURAL EVENING,And mumble news that still as secrets go;
2317,RURAL EVENING,"When, heedless then to all the rest may say,"
2318,RURAL EVENING,"The beckoning lover nods the maid away,"
2319,RURAL EVENING,And at a distance many an hour they seem
2320,RURAL EVENING,In jealous whisperings o’er their pleasing theme;
2321,RURAL EVENING,"While children round them teasing sports prolong,"
2322,RURAL EVENING,"To twirl the top, or bounce the hoop along,"
2323,RURAL EVENING,"Or shout across the street their “one catch all,”"
2324,RURAL EVENING,Or prog the hous’d bee from the cotter’s wall.
2325,RURAL EVENING,
2326,RURAL EVENING,"Now at the parish cottage wall’d with dirt,"
2327,RURAL EVENING,"Where all the cumber-grounds of life resort,"
2328,RURAL EVENING,"From the low door that bows two props between,"
2329,RURAL EVENING,Some feeble tottering dame surveys the scene;
2330,RURAL EVENING,By them reminded of the long-lost day
2331,RURAL EVENING,"When she herself was young, and went to play;"
2332,RURAL EVENING,"And, turning to the painful scenes again,"
2333,RURAL EVENING,"The mournful changes she has meet since then,"
2334,RURAL EVENING,"Her aching heart, the contrast moves so keen,"
2335,RURAL EVENING,E’en sighs a wish that life had never been.
2336,RURAL EVENING,"Still vainly sinning, while she strives to pray,"
2337,RURAL EVENING,Half-smother’d discontent pursues its way
2338,RURAL EVENING,"In whispering Providence, how blest she’d been"
2339,RURAL EVENING,If life’s last troubles she’d escap’d unseen;
2340,RURAL EVENING,"If, ere want sneak’d for grudg’d support from pride,"
2341,RURAL EVENING,"She had but shar’d of childhood’s joys, and died."
2342,RURAL EVENING,"And as to talk some passing neighbours stand,"
2343,RURAL EVENING,"And shove their box within her tottering hand,"
2344,RURAL EVENING,"She turns from echoes of her younger years,"
2345,RURAL EVENING,And nips the portion of her snuff with tears.

2360,RUSTIC FISHING,"Tracking the dewy grass with many a mate,"
2361,RUSTIC FISHING,"To seek the brook that down the meadows glides,"
2362,RUSTIC FISHING,"Where the grey willow shadows by its sides,"
2363,RUSTIC FISHING,"Where flag and reed in wild disorder spread,"

2457,JUNE,"The May-month wild flowers and their gaudy show,"
2458,JUNE,"Leaving, a school-boy’s height, in snugger rest,"
2459,JUNE,"The leveret’s seat, and lark, and partridge nest."
2460,JUNE,"The mowers now bend o’er the beaded grass,"
2461,JUNE,Where oft the gipsy’s hungry journeying ass
2462,JUNE,"Will turn his wishes from the meadow paths,"
2463,JUNE,List’ning the rustle of the falling swaths.
2464,JUNE,The ploughman sweats along the fallow vales
2465,JUNE,And down the sun-crack’d furrow slowly trails;
2466,JUNE,"Oft seeking, when athirst, the brook’s supply,"
2467,JUNE,"Where, brushing eagerly the bushes by"
2468,JUNE,"For coolest water, he disturbs the rest"
2469,JUNE,"Of ring-dove, brooding o’er its idle nest."
2470,JUNE,The shepherd’s leisure hours are over now;
2471,JUNE,"No more he loiters ’neath the hedge-row bough,"
2472,JUNE,On shadow-pillowed banks and lolling stile;
2473,JUNE,The wilds must lose their summer friend awhile.
2474,JUNE,"With whistle, barking dogs, and chiding scold,"
2475,JUNE,He drives the bleating sheep from fallow fold
2476,JUNE,"To wash-pools, where the willow shadows lean,"
2477,JUNE,"Dashing them in, their stained coats to clean,"
2478,JUNE,"Then, on the sunny sward, when dry again,"
2479,JUNE,"He brings them homeward to the clipping pen,"
2480,JUNE,"Of hurdles, form’d where elm or sycamore"
2481,JUNE,Shut out the sun--or to some threshing-floor.
2482,JUNE,"There with the scraps of songs, and laugh, and tale,"
2483,JUNE,"He lightens annual toil, while merry ale"
2484,JUNE,"Goes round, and glads some old man’s heart to praise"
2485,JUNE,The threadbare customs of his early days:
2486,JUNE,How the high bowl was in the middle set
2487,JUNE,"At breakfast time, when clippers yearly met,"
2488,JUNE,"Fill’d full of furmety, where dainty swum"
2489,JUNE,The streaking sugar and the spotting plum.
2490,JUNE,The maids could never to the table bring
2491,JUNE,"The bowl, without one rising from the ring"
2492,JUNE,"To lend a hand; who, if ’twere ta’en amiss,"
2493,JUNE,Would sell his kindness for a stolen kiss.
2494,JUNE,The large stone pitcher in its homely trim
2495,JUNE,"And clouded pint-horn with its copper rim,"
2496,JUNE,"Were there; from which were drunk, with spirits high"
2497,JUNE,Healths of the best the cellar could supply;
2498,JUNE,"While sung the ancient swains, in uncouth rhymes,"
2499,JUNE,Songs that were pictures of the good old times.
2500,JUNE,"Thus will the old man ancient ways bewail,"
2501,JUNE,"Till toiling shears gain ground upon the tale,"
2502,JUNE,"And break it off,--for now the timid sheep,"
2503,JUNE,"His fleece shorn off, starts with a fearful leap,"
2504,JUNE,"Shaking his naked skin with wond’ring joys,"
2505,JUNE,While others are brought in by sturdy boys.
2506,JUNE,Though fashion’s haughty frown hath thrown aside
2507,JUNE,"Half the old forms simplicity supplied,"
2508,JUNE,"Yet there are some pride’s winter deigns to spare,"
2509,JUNE,Left like green ivy when the trees are bare.
2510,JUNE,"And now, when shearing of the flocks is done"
2511,JUNE,"Some ancient customs, mix’d with harmless fun,"
2512,JUNE,"Crown the swain’s merry toils. The timid maid,"
2513,JUNE,"Pleased to be praised, and yet of praise afraid,"
2514,JUNE,"Seeks the best flowers; not those of woods and fields,"
2515,JUNE,But such as every farmer’s garden yields--
2516,JUNE,"Fine cabbage-roses, painted like her face;"
2517,JUNE,"The shining pansy, trimm’d with golden lace;"
2518,JUNE,"The tall topp’d larkheels, feather’d thick with flowers;"
2519,JUNE,"The woodbine, climbing o’er the door in bowers;"
2520,JUNE,"The London tufts, of many a mottled hue;"
2521,JUNE,"The pale pink pea, and monkshood darkly blue;"
2522,JUNE,"The white and purple gilliflowers, that stay"
2523,JUNE,"Ling’ring, in blossom, summer half away;"
2524,JUNE,"The single blood-walls, of a luscious smell,"
2525,JUNE,Old-fashion’d flowers which housewives love so well;
2526,JUNE,"The columbine, stone-blue, or deep night-brown,"
2527,JUNE,"Their honeycomb-like blossoms hanging down,"
2528,JUNE,"Each cottage-garden’s fond adopted child,"
2529,JUNE,"Though heaths still claim them, where they yet grow wild;"
2530,JUNE,"With marjoram knots, sweet-brier, and ribbon-grass,"
2531,JUNE,"And lavender, the choice of ev’ry lass,"
2532,JUNE,"And sprigs of lad’s-love--all familiar names,"
2533,JUNE,Which every garden through the village claims.
2534,JUNE,"These the maid gathers with a coy delight,"
2535,JUNE,"And ties them up, in readiness for night;"
2536,JUNE,"Then gives to ev’ry swain, ’tween love and shame,"
2537,JUNE,Her “clipping-posies” as his yearly claim.
2538,JUNE,"He rises, to obtain the custom’d kiss:--"
2539,JUNE,"With stifled smiles, half hankering after bliss,"
2540,JUNE,"She shrinks away, and blushing, calls it rude;"
2541,JUNE,"Yet turns to smile, and hopes to be pursued;"
2542,JUNE,"While one, to whom the hint may be applied,"
2543,JUNE,"Follows to gain it, and is not denied."
2544,JUNE,"The rest the loud laugh raise, to make it known,--"
2545,JUNE,"She blushes silent, and will not disown!"
2546,JUNE,"Thus ale, and song, and healths, and merry ways,"
2547,JUNE,Keep up a shadow still of former days;
2548,JUNE,"But the old beechen bowl, that once supplied"
2549,JUNE,"The feast of furmety, is thrown aside;"
2550,JUNE,"And the old freedom that was living then,"
2551,JUNE,When masters made them merry with their men;
2552,JUNE,"When all their coats alike were russet brown,"
2553,JUNE,And his rude speech was vulgar as their own--
2554,JUNE,"All this is past, and soon will pass away"
2555,JUNE,The time-torn remnant of the holiday.

2564,DECEMBER,"Makes room to give him welcome now,"
2565,DECEMBER,"E’en want will dry its tears in mirth,"
2566,DECEMBER,And crown him with a holly bough;
2567,DECEMBER,"Though tramping ’neath a winter sky,"
2568,DECEMBER,"O’er snowy paths and rimy stiles,"
2569,DECEMBER,The housewife sets her spinning by
2570,DECEMBER,To bid him welcome with her smiles.
2571,DECEMBER,
2572,DECEMBER,"Each house is swept the day before,"
2573,DECEMBER,"And windows stuck with evergreens,"
2574,DECEMBER,"The snow is besom’d from the door,"
2575,DECEMBER,And comfort crowns the cottage scenes.
2576,DECEMBER,"Gilt holly, with its thorny pricks,"
2577,DECEMBER,"And yew and box, with berries small,"
2578,DECEMBER,"These deck the unused candlesticks,"
2579,DECEMBER,And pictures hanging by the wall.
2580,DECEMBER,
2581,DECEMBER,"Neighbours resume their annual cheer,"
2582,DECEMBER,"Wishing, with smiles and spirits high,"
2583,DECEMBER,"Glad Christmas and a happy year,"
2584,DECEMBER,To every morning passer-by;
2585,DECEMBER,"Milkmaids their Christmas journeys go,"
2586,DECEMBER,Accompanied with favour’d swain;
2587,DECEMBER,And children pace the crumping snow
2588,DECEMBER,To taste their granny’s cake again.
2589,DECEMBER,
2590,DECEMBER,"The shepherd, now no more afraid,"
2591,DECEMBER,"Since custom doth the chance bestow,"
2592,DECEMBER,Starts up to kiss the giggling maid
2593,DECEMBER,Beneath the branch of mistletoe
2594,DECEMBER,"That ’neath each cottage beam is seen,"
2595,DECEMBER,With pearl-like berries shining gay;
2596,DECEMBER,"The shadow still of what hath been,"
2597,DECEMBER,Which fashion yearly fades away.
2598,DECEMBER,
2599,DECEMBER,"The singing wates, a merry throng,"
2600,DECEMBER,"At early morn, with simple skill,"
2601,DECEMBER,"Yet imitate the angel’s song,"
2602,DECEMBER,And chant their Christmas ditty still;
2603,DECEMBER,And ’mid the storm that dies and swells
2604,DECEMBER,By fits--in hummings softly steals
2605,DECEMBER,"The music of the village bells,"
2606,DECEMBER,Ringing round their merry peals.
2607,DECEMBER,
2608,DECEMBER,"When this is past, a merry crew,"
2609,DECEMBER,"Bedeck’d in masks and ribbons gay,"
2610,DECEMBER,"The “Morris-dance,” their sports renew,"
2611,DECEMBER,And act their winter evening play.
2612,DECEMBER,"The clown turn’d king, for penny-praise,"
2613,DECEMBER,Storms with the actor’s strut and swell;
2614,DECEMBER,"And Harlequin, a laugh to raise,"
2615,DECEMBER,Wears his hunch-back and tinkling bell.
2616,DECEMBER,
2617,DECEMBER,"And oft for pence and spicy ale,"
2618,DECEMBER,"With winter nosegays pinn’d before,"
2619,DECEMBER,"The wassail-singer tells her tale,"
2620,DECEMBER,And drawls her Christmas carols o’er.
2621,DECEMBER,"While ’prentice boy, with ruddy face,"
2622,DECEMBER,"And rime-bepowder’d, dancing locks,"
2623,DECEMBER,"From door to door with happy pace,"
2624,DECEMBER,Runs round to claim his “Christmas box.”
2625,DECEMBER,
2626,DECEMBER,"The block upon the fire is put,"
2627,DECEMBER,To sanction custom’s old desires;
2628,DECEMBER,"And many a fagot’s bands are cut,"
2629,DECEMBER,For the old farmers’ Christmas fires;
2630,DECEMBER,"Where loud-tongued Gladness joins the throng,"
2631,DECEMBER,"And Winter meets the warmth of May,"
2632,DECEMBER,"Till feeling soon the heat too strong,"
2633,DECEMBER,"He rubs his shins, and draws away."
2634,DECEMBER,
2635,DECEMBER,"While snows the window-panes bedim,"
2636,DECEMBER,"The fire curls up a sunny charm,"
2637,DECEMBER,"Where, creaming o’er the pitcher’s rim,"
2638,DECEMBER,The flowering ale is set to warm;
2639,DECEMBER,"Mirth, full of joy as summer bees,"
2640,DECEMBER,"Sits there, its pleasures to impart"
2641,DECEMBER,"And children, ’tween their parent’s knees,"
2642,DECEMBER,Sing scraps of carols o’er by heart.
2643,DECEMBER,
2644,DECEMBER,"And some, to view the winter weathers,"
2645,DECEMBER,Climb up the window-seat with glee.
2646,DECEMBER,"Likening the snow to falling feathers,"
2647,DECEMBER,In Fancy’s infant ecstasy;
2648,DECEMBER,"Laughing, with superstitious love,"
2649,DECEMBER,"O’er visions wild that youth supplies,"
2650,DECEMBER,"Of people pulling geese above,"
2651,DECEMBER,And keeping Christmas in the skies.
2652,DECEMBER,
2653,DECEMBER,"As tho’ the homestead trees were drest,"
2654,DECEMBER,"In lieu of snow, with dancing leaves;"
2655,DECEMBER,"As tho’ the sun-dried martin’s nest,"
2656,DECEMBER,Instead of i’cles hung the eaves;
2657,DECEMBER,The children hail the happy day--
2658,DECEMBER,"As if the snow were April’s grass,"
2659,DECEMBER,"And pleas’d, as ’neath the warmth of May,"
2660,DECEMBER,Sport o’er the water froze to glass.
2661,DECEMBER,
2662,DECEMBER,"Thou day of happy sound and mirth,"
2663,DECEMBER,"That long with childish memory stays,"
2664,DECEMBER,How blest around the cottage hearth
2665,DECEMBER,I met thee in my younger days!
2666,DECEMBER,"Harping, with rapture’s dreaming joys,"
2667,DECEMBER,"On presents which thy coming found,"
2668,DECEMBER,"The welcome sight of little toys,"
2669,DECEMBER,The Christmas gifts of cousins round.
2670,DECEMBER,
2671,DECEMBER,"The wooden horse with arching head,"
2672,DECEMBER,Drawn upon wheels around the room;
2673,DECEMBER,"The gilded coach of gingerbread,"
2674,DECEMBER,And many-colour’d sugar plum;
2675,DECEMBER,"Gilt cover’d books for pictures sought,"
2676,DECEMBER,"Or stories childhood loves to tell,"
2677,DECEMBER,"With many an urgent promise bought,"
2678,DECEMBER,To get to-morrow’s lesson well.
2679,DECEMBER,
2680,DECEMBER,"And many a thing, a minute’s sport,"
2681,DECEMBER,"Left broken on the sanded floor,"
2682,DECEMBER,"When we would leave our play, and court"
2683,DECEMBER,Our parent’s promises for more.
2684,DECEMBER,"Tho’ manhood bids such raptures die,"
2685,DECEMBER,"And throws such toys aside as vain,"
2686,DECEMBER,"Yet memory loves to turn her eye,"
2687,DECEMBER,And count past pleasures o’er again.
2688,DECEMBER,
2689,DECEMBER,"Around the glowing hearth at night,"
2690,DECEMBER,The harmless laugh and winter tale
2691,DECEMBER,"Go round, while parting friends delight"
2692,DECEMBER,To toast each other o’er their ale;
2693,DECEMBER,The cotter oft with quiet zeal
2694,DECEMBER,Will musing o’er his Bible lean;
2695,DECEMBER,While in the dark the lovers steal
2696,DECEMBER,To kiss and toy behind the screen.
2697,DECEMBER,
2698,DECEMBER,Old customs! Oh! I love the sound:
2699,DECEMBER,However simple they may be:
2700,DECEMBER,"Whate’er with time have sanction found,"
2701,DECEMBER,"Is welcome, and is dear to me."
2702,DECEMBER,"Pride grows above simplicity,"
2703,DECEMBER,"And spurns them from her haughty mind,"
2704,DECEMBER,And soon the poet’s song will be
2705,DECEMBER,The only refuge they can find.

2750,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"Left by the stormy blast,"
2751,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"The little hopeful blossom peeps,"
2752,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,And tells of winter past:
2753,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"A few leaves flutter from the woods,"
2754,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"That hung the season through,"
2755,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,Leaving their place for swelling buds
2756,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,To spread their leaves anew.

2764,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"Drones, venturing on in sunny hours,"
2765,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,Its humming song to thee.
2766,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,
2767,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"The birds are busy on the wing,"

2775,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,
2776,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"The soft wind fans the violet blue,"
2777,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"Its opening sweets to share,"

2790,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"Where dews fall from the tree,"
2791,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,The creeping sun smiles on the bank
2792,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,And warms a seat for thee.
2793,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,
2794,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,The eager morning earlier wakes
2795,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"To glad thy fond desires,"
2796,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,And oft its rosy bed forsakes

2820,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,
2821,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,I’ve met the Winter’s biting breath
2822,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"In nature’s wild retreat,"
2823,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"When Silence listens as in death,"
2824,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,And thought its wildness sweet;
2825,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,And I have loved the Winter’s calm
2826,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"When frost has left the plain,"
2827,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,When suns that morning waken’d warm
2828,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,Left eve to freeze again.
2829,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,
2830,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,I’ve heard in Autumn’s early reign
2831,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"Her first, her gentlest song;"
2832,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"I’ve mark’d her change o’er wood and plain,"
2833,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,And wish’d her reign were long;
2834,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"Till winds like armies, gather’d round,"
2835,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"And stripp’d her colour’d woods,"
2836,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"And storms urged on, with thunder-sound"
2837,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,Their desolating floods.
2838,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,
2839,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"And Summer’s endless stretch of green,"
2840,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"Spread over plain and tree,"
2841,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"Sweet solace to my eyes has been,"
2842,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,As it to all must be;
2843,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"Long I have stood his burning heat,"
2844,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"And breathed the sultry day,"
2845,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"And walk’d and toil’d with weary feet,"
2846,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,Nor wish’d his pride away.
2847,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,
2848,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,But oft I’ve watch’d the greening buds
2849,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"Brush’d by the linnet’s wing,"
2850,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"When, like a child, the gladden’d woods"
2851,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,First lisp the voice of Spring;
2852,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"When flowers, like dreams, peep every day,"
2853,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,Reminding what they bring;
2854,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,"I’ve watch’d them, and am warn’d to pay"
2855,THE APPROACH OF SPRING,A preference to Spring.

2882,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Yet, lovely Muse, I still believe thee by,"
2883,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"And think I see thee smile, and so forget I sigh."
2884,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,
2885,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Muse of the Cottage Hearth! oft did I tell
2886,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"My hopes to thee, nor feared to plead in vain;"
2887,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"But felt around my heart thy witching spell,"
2888,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,That bade me as thy worshipper remain:
2889,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"I did so, and still worship. Oh! again"
2890,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Smile on my offerings, and so keep them green!"
2891,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Bedeck my fancies like the clouds of even,"
2892,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Mingling all hues which thou from heaven dost glean!
2893,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"To me a portion of thy power be given,"
2894,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,If theme so mean as mine may merit aught of heaven.
2895,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,
2896,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"For thee in youth I culled the simple flower,"
2897,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"That on thy bosom gained a sweeter hue,"
2898,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"And took thy hand along life’s sunny hour,"
2899,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Meeting the sweetest joys that ever grew:
2900,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"More friends were needless, and my foes were few."
2901,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Though freedom then be deemed as rudeness now.
2902,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"And what once won thy praise now meets disdain,"
2903,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Yet the last wreath I braided for thy brow,"
2904,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Thy smiles did so commend, it made me vain"
2905,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"To weave another one, and hope for praise again."
2906,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,
2907,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,With thee the spirit of departed years
2908,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Wakes that sweet voice which time hath rendered dumb;
2909,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"And freshens, like to spring, loves, hopes, and fears,"
2910,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"That in my bosom found an early home,"
2911,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Wooing the heart to ecstasy.--I come
2912,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"To thee, when sick of care, of joy bereft,"
2913,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Seeking the pleasures that are found in bloom.
2914,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"O happy hopes, that Time hath only left"
2915,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Around the haunts where thou didst erst sojourn!
2916,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Then smile, sweet Muse, again, and welcome my return."
2917,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,
2918,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,With thee the raptures of life’s early day
2919,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Appear, and all that pleased me when a boy."
2920,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Though pains and cares have torn the best away,"
2921,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"And winter creeps between us to destroy,"
2922,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Do thou commend, the recompence is joy:"
2923,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,The tempest of the heart shall soon be calm.
2924,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Though sterner Truth against my dreams rebel,"
2925,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Hope feels success; and all my spirits warm,"
2926,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"To strike with happier mood thy simple shell,"
2927,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,And seize thy mantle’s hem--O! say not fare-thee-well.
2928,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,
2929,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Still, sweet Enchantress! youth’s strong feelings move,"
2930,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,That from thy presence their existence took:--
2931,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"The innocent idolatry and love,"
2932,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Paying thee worship in each secret nook,"
2933,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"That fancied friends in tree, and flower, and brook,"
2934,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Shaped clouds to angels and beheld them smile,"
2935,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,And heard commending tongues in ev’ry wind.
2936,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Life’s grosser fancies did these dreams defile,"
2937,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Yet not entirely root them from the mind;
2938,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"I think I hear them still, and often look behind."
2939,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,
2940,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Aye, I have heard thee in the summer wind,"
2941,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,As if commending what I sung to thee;
2942,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Aye, I have seen thee on a cloud reclined,"
2943,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Kindling my fancies into poesy;
2944,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"I saw thee smile, and took the praise to me."
2945,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"In beauties, past all beauty, thou wert drest;"
2946,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,I thought the very clouds around thee knelt:
2947,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"I saw the sun to linger in the west,"
2948,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Paying thee worship; and as eve did melt
2949,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"In dews, they seemed thy tears for sorrows I had felt."
2950,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,
2951,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Sweeter than flowers on beauty’s bosom hung,"
2952,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Sweeter than dreams of happiness above,"
2953,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Sweeter than themes by lips of beauty sung,"
2954,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Are the young fancies of a poet’s love.
2955,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,When round his thoughts thy trancing visions move.
2956,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"In floating melody no notes may sound,"
2957,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"The world is all forgot and past his care,"
2958,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"While on thy harp thy fingers lightly bound,"
2959,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,As winning him its melody to share;
2960,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"And heaven itself, with him, where is it then but there?"
2961,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,
2962,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"E’en now my heart leaps out from grief, and all"
2963,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,The gloom thrown round by Care’s o’ershading wing;
2964,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"E’en now those sunny visions to recall,"
2965,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Like to a bird I quit dull earth and sing:
2966,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Life’s tempest swoon to calms on every string.
2967,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Ah! sweet Enchantress, if I do but dream,"
2968,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"If earthly visions have been only mine,"
2969,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"My weakness in thy service woos esteem,"
2970,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,And proves my truth as almost worthy thine:
2971,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Surely true worship makes the meanest theme divine.
2972,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,
2973,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"And still, warm courage, calming many a fear,"
2974,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Heartens my hand once more thy harp to try
2975,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,To join the anthem of the minstrel year:
2976,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,For summer’s music in thy praise is high;
2977,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,The very winds about thy mantle sigh
2978,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Love-melodies; thy minstrel bards to be,"
2979,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Insects and birds, exerting all their skill,"
2980,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Float in continued song for mastery,"
2981,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"While in thy haunts loud leaps the little rill,"
2982,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,To kiss thy mantle’s hem; and how can I be still?
2983,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,
2984,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"There still I see thee fold thy mantle grey,"
2985,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,To trace the dewy lawn at morn and night;
2986,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"And there I see thee, in the sunny day,"
2987,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Withdraw thy veil and shine confest in light;
2988,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Burning my fancies with a wild delight,"
2989,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,To win a portion of thy blushing fame.
2990,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Though haughty Fancy treat thy power as small,"
2991,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"And Fashion thy simplicity disclaim,"
2992,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Should but a portion of thy mantle fall
2993,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"O’er him who woos thy love, ’tis recompense for all."
2994,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,
2995,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Not with the mighty to thy shrine I come,"
2996,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"In anxious sighs, or self applauding mirth,"
2997,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,On Mount Parnassus as thine heir to roam:
2998,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,I dare not credit that immortal birth;
2999,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,But mingling with the lesser ones on earth--
3000,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Like as the little lark from off its nest,"
3001,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Beside the mossy hill awakes in glee,"
3002,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,To seek the morning’s throne a merry guest--
3003,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"So do I seek thy shrine, if that may be,"
3004,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,To win by new attempts another smile from thee.
3005,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,
3006,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"If without thee ’neath storms, and clouds, and wind,"
3007,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"I’ve roam’d the wood, and field, and meadow lea;"
3008,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"And found no flowers but what the vulgar find,"
3009,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Nor met one breath of living poesy,"
3010,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Among such charms where inspirations be;
3011,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,The fault is mine--and I must bear the lot
3012,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Of missing praise to merit thy disdain.
3013,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"To feel each idle plea though urged, forgot;"
3014,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,I can but sigh--though foolish to complain
3015,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"O’er hopes so fair begun, to find them end so vain."
3016,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,
3017,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Then will it prove presumption thus to dare
3018,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"To add fresh failings to each faulty song,"
3019,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Urging thy blessings on an idle prayer,"
3020,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,To sanction silly themes: it will be wrong
3021,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,For one so lowly to be heard so long.
3022,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Yet, sweet Enchantress, yet a little while"
3023,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Forego impatience, and from frowns refrain;"
3024,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"The strong are ne’er debarr’d thy cheering smile,"
3025,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Why should the weak, who need them most, complain"
3026,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Alone, in solitude, soliciting in vain?"
3027,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,
3028,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"But if my efforts on thy harp prove true,"
3029,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Which bashful youth at first so feared to try;
3030,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,If aught of nature be in sounds I drew
3031,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"From hope’s young dreams, and doubt’s uncertainty,"
3032,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"To these late offerings, not without their sigh;"
3033,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Then on thine altar shall these themes be laid,"
3034,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"And past the deeds of graven brass remain,"
3035,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,Filling a space in time that shall not fade;
3036,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"And if it be not so--avert disdain,"
3037,TO THE RURAL MUSE.,"Till dust shall feel no sting, nor know it toil’d in vain."

3233,SUMMER IMAGES,While on the meadow-bridge the pausing boy
3234,SUMMER IMAGES,"Listens the mellow sounds,"
3235,SUMMER IMAGES,And hums in vacant joy.
3236,SUMMER IMAGES,
3237,SUMMER IMAGES,"Now homeward-bound, the hedger bundles round"
3238,SUMMER IMAGES,"His evening faggot, and with every stride"
3239,SUMMER IMAGES,"His leathern doublet leaves a rustling sound,"
3240,SUMMER IMAGES,Till silly sheep beside
3241,SUMMER IMAGES,"His path start tremulous, and once again"
3242,SUMMER IMAGES,"Look back dissatisfied,"
3243,SUMMER IMAGES,And scour the dewy plain.
3244,SUMMER IMAGES,
3245,SUMMER IMAGES,How sweet the soothing calmness that distills
3246,SUMMER IMAGES,"O’er the heart’s every sense its opiate dews,"
3247,SUMMER IMAGES,In meek-eyed moods and ever balmy trills!
3248,SUMMER IMAGES,"That softens and subdues,"

3251,SUMMER IMAGES,In many a mellow strain!
3252,SUMMER IMAGES,
3253,SUMMER IMAGES,"I love to walk the fields, they are to me"
3254,SUMMER IMAGES,A legacy no evil can destroy;

3292,AUTUMN,"Which woo the winds to play,"
3293,AUTUMN,And with them dance for joy;
3294,AUTUMN,
3295,AUTUMN,"And meadow pools, torn wide by lawless floods,"
3296,AUTUMN,"Where water-lilies spread their oily leaves,"
3297,AUTUMN,"On which, as wont, the fly"
3298,AUTUMN,Oft battens in the sun;
3299,AUTUMN,
3300,AUTUMN,"Where leans the mossy willow half way o’er,"
3301,AUTUMN,On which the shepherd crawls astride to throw
3302,AUTUMN,"His angle, clear of weeds"
3303,AUTUMN,That crowd the water’s brim;
3304,AUTUMN,
3305,AUTUMN,"Or crispy hills, and hollows scant of sward,"
3306,AUTUMN,"Where, step by step, the patient lonely boy"
3307,AUTUMN,Hath cut rude flights of stairs
3308,AUTUMN,To climb their steepy sides;
3309,AUTUMN,
3310,AUTUMN,"Then track along their feet, grown hoarse with noise,"
3311,AUTUMN,"The crawling brook, that ekes its weary speed,"
3312,AUTUMN,And struggles through the weeds
3313,AUTUMN,With faint and sullen brawl.--
3314,AUTUMN,
3315,AUTUMN,"These haunts I long have favoured, more as now"
3316,AUTUMN,"With thee thus wandering, moralizing on;"
3317,AUTUMN,"Stealing glad thoughts from grief,"
3318,AUTUMN,"And happy, though I sigh."
3319,AUTUMN,
3320,AUTUMN,"Sweet Vision, with the wild dishevelled hair,"
3321,AUTUMN,"And raiment shadowy of each wind’s embrace,"
3322,AUTUMN,Fain would I win thine harp
3323,AUTUMN,To one accordant theme.
3324,AUTUMN,
3325,AUTUMN,"Now not inaptly craved, communing thus,"
3326,AUTUMN,"Beneath the curdled arms of this stunt oak,"
3327,AUTUMN,"While pillowed on the grass,"
3328,AUTUMN,We fondly ruminate
3329,AUTUMN,
3330,AUTUMN,"O’er the disordered scenes of woods and fields,"
3331,AUTUMN,"Ploughed lands, thin travelled with half-hungry sheep,"
3332,AUTUMN,"Pastures tracked deep with cows,"
3333,AUTUMN,Where small birds seek for seed:
3334,AUTUMN,
3335,AUTUMN,Marking the cow-boy that so merry trills
3336,AUTUMN,"His frequent, unpremeditated song,"
3337,AUTUMN,"Wooing the winds to pause,"
3338,AUTUMN,Till echo brawls again;
3339,AUTUMN,
3340,AUTUMN,"As on with plashy step, and clouted shoon,"
3341,AUTUMN,"He roves, half indolent and self-employed,"
3342,AUTUMN,To rob the little birds
3343,AUTUMN,"Of hips and pendant haws,"
3344,AUTUMN,
3345,AUTUMN,"And sloes, dim covered as with dewy veils,"
3346,AUTUMN,"And rambling bramble-berries, pulpy and sweet,"
3347,AUTUMN,Arching their prickly trails
3348,AUTUMN,Half o’er the narrow lane:
3349,AUTUMN,
3350,AUTUMN,Noting the hedger front with stubborn face
3351,AUTUMN,"The dank bleak wind, that whistles thinly by"
3352,AUTUMN,"His leathern garb, thorn proof,"
3353,AUTUMN,And cheek red hot with toil;
3354,AUTUMN,
3355,AUTUMN,"While o’er the pleachy lands of mellow brown,"
3356,AUTUMN,The mower’s stubbling scythe clogs to his foot
3357,AUTUMN,"The ever ekeing whisp,"
3358,AUTUMN,"With sharp and sudden jerk,"
3359,AUTUMN,
3360,AUTUMN,Till into formal rows the russet shocks
3361,AUTUMN,"Crowd the blank field to thatch time-weather’d barns,"
3362,AUTUMN,"And hovels rude repair,"
3363,AUTUMN,Stript by disturbing winds.
3364,AUTUMN,
3365,AUTUMN,See! from the rustling scythe the haunted hare
3366,AUTUMN,"Scampers circuitous, with startled ears"
3367,AUTUMN,"Prickt up, then squat, as by"
3368,AUTUMN,"She brushes to the woods,"
3369,AUTUMN,
3370,AUTUMN,"Where reeded grass, breast-high and undisturbed,"
3371,AUTUMN,"Forms pleasant clumps, through which the soothing winds"
3372,AUTUMN,"Soften her rigid fears,"
3373,AUTUMN,And lull to calm repose.
3374,AUTUMN,
3375,AUTUMN,"Wild Sorceress! me thy restless mood delights,"
3376,AUTUMN,"More than the stir of summer’s crowded scenes,"
3377,AUTUMN,"Where, jostled in the din,"
3378,AUTUMN,Joy palled my ear with song;
3379,AUTUMN,
3380,AUTUMN,"Heart-sickening for the silence, that is here"
3381,AUTUMN,"Not broken inharmoniously, as now"
3382,AUTUMN,That lone and vagrant bee
3383,AUTUMN,Booms faint with weary chime.
3384,AUTUMN,
3385,AUTUMN,Now filtering winds thin winnow through the woods
3386,AUTUMN,"In tremulous noise, that bids, at every breath,"
3387,AUTUMN,Some sickly cankered leaf
3388,AUTUMN,"Let go its hold, and die."
3389,AUTUMN,
3390,AUTUMN,"And now the bickering storm, with sudden start,"
3391,AUTUMN,"In flirting fits of anger carps aloud,"
3392,AUTUMN,"Thee urging to thine end,"
3393,AUTUMN,Sore wept by troubled skies.
3394,AUTUMN,
3395,AUTUMN,"And yet, sublime in grief! thy thoughts delight"
3396,AUTUMN,"To show me visions of most gorgeous dyes,"
3397,AUTUMN,Haply forgetting now
3398,AUTUMN,They but prepare thy shroud;
3399,AUTUMN,
3400,AUTUMN,"Thy pencil dashing its excess of shades,"
3401,AUTUMN,"Improvident of waste, till every bough"
3402,AUTUMN,Burns with thy mellow touch
3403,AUTUMN,Disorderly divine.
3404,AUTUMN,
3405,AUTUMN,Soon must I view thee as a pleasant dream
3406,AUTUMN,"Droop faintly, and so reckon for thine end,"
3407,AUTUMN,As sad the winds sink low
3408,AUTUMN,In dirges for their queen;
3409,AUTUMN,
3410,AUTUMN,"While in the moment of their weary pause,"
3411,AUTUMN,"To cheer thy bankrupt pomp, the willing lark"
3412,AUTUMN,"Starts from his shielding clod,"
3413,AUTUMN,Snatching sweet scraps of song.
3414,AUTUMN,
3415,AUTUMN,"Thy life is waning now, and Silence tries"
3416,AUTUMN,"To mourn, but meets no sympathy in sounds,"
3417,AUTUMN,"As stooping low she bends,"
3418,AUTUMN,Forming with leaves thy grave;
3419,AUTUMN,
3420,AUTUMN,"To sleep inglorious there mid tangled woods,"
3421,AUTUMN,Till parched-lipped Summer pines in drought away
3422,AUTUMN,Then from thine ivy’d trance
3423,AUTUMN,Awake to glories new.

3439,THE VANITIES OF LIFE,
3440,THE VANITIES OF LIFE,Is pride thy heart’s desire?

3449,THE VANITIES OF LIFE,Dost think thy pride exalts

3557,THE VANITIES OF LIFE,Who thinks that love doth live
3558,THE VANITIES OF LIFE,"In beauty’s tempting show,"

3582,THE VANITIES OF LIFE,As suits thy ends the best.
3583,THE VANITIES OF LIFE,
3584,THE VANITIES OF LIFE,Or pause amid thy toils
3585,THE VANITIES OF LIFE,"For visions won and lost,"

3696,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,All in a moment stopt. I watched in vain;
3697,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"The timid bird had left the hazel bush,"
3698,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,And at a distance hid to sing again.
3699,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"Lost in a wilderness of listening leaves,"
3700,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"Rich Ecstasy would pour its luscious strain,"
3701,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,Till envy spurred the emulating thrush
3702,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,To start less wild and scarce inferior songs;
3703,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"For while of half the year Care him bereaves,"
3704,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,To damp the ardour of his speckled breast;
3705,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"The nightingale to summer’s life belongs,"
3706,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"And naked trees, and winter’s nipping wrongs,"
3707,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,Are strangers to her music and her rest.
3708,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"Her joys are evergreen, her world is wide--"
3709,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,Hark! there she is as usual--let’s be hush--
3710,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"For in this black-thorn clump, if rightly guest,"
3711,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,Her curious house is hidden. Part aside
3712,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"These hazel branches in a gentle way,"
3713,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"And stoop right cautious ’neath the rustling boughs,"
3714,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"For we will have another search to-day,"
3715,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,And hunt this fern-strewn thorn-clump round and round;
3716,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"And where this reeded wood-grass idly bows,"
3717,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"We’ll wade right through, it is a likely nook:"
3718,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"In such like spots, and often on the ground,"
3719,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"They’ll build, where rude boys never think to look--"
3720,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"Aye, as I live! her secret nest is here,"
3721,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,Upon this white-thorn stump! I’ve searched about
3722,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,For hours in vain. There! put that bramble by--
3723,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"Nay, trample on its branches and get near."
3724,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"How subtle is the bird! she started out,"
3725,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"And raised a plaintive note of danger nigh,"
3726,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"Ere we were past the brambles; and now, near"
3727,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"Her nest, she sudden stops--as choking fear,"
3728,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,That might betray her home. So even now
3729,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,We’ll leave it as we found it; safety’s guard
3730,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,Of pathless solitude shall keep it still.
3731,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"See there; she’s sitting on the old oak bough,"
3732,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,Mute in her fears; our presence doth retard
3733,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"Her joys, and doubt turns every rapture chill."
3734,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"Sing on, sweet bird! may no worse hap befall"
3735,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"Thy visions, than the fear that now deceives."
3736,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"We will not plunder music of its dower,"
3737,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,Nor turn this spot of happiness to thrall;
3738,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"For melody seems hid in every flower,"
3739,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,That blossoms near thy home. These harebells all
3740,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,Seem bowing with the beautiful in song;
3741,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"And gaping cuckoo-flowers, with spotted leaves,"
3742,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,Seems blushing of the singing it has heard.
3743,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,How curious is the nest; no other bird
3744,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"Uses such loose materials, or weaves"
3745,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,Its dwelling in such spots: dead open leaves
3746,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"Are placed without, and velvet moss within,"
3747,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"And little scraps of grass, and, scant and spare,"
3748,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"What scarcely seem materials, down and hair;"
3749,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,For from men’s haunts she nothing seems to win.
3750,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"Yet Nature is the builder, and contrives"
3751,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"Homes for her children’s comfort, even here;"
3752,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,Where Solitude’s disciples spend their lives
3753,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"Unseen, save when a wanderer passes near"
3754,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"That loves such pleasant places. Deep adown,"
3755,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,The nest is made a hermit’s mossy cell.
3756,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"Snug lie her curious eggs in number five,"
3757,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"Of deadened green, or rather olive brown;"
3758,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,And the old prickly thorn-bush guards them well.
3759,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,"So here we’ll leave them, still unknown to wrong,"
3760,THE NIGHTINGALE’S NEST,As the old woodland’s legacy of song.

3924,DECAY,"I hardly knew her face again,"
3925,DECAY,Nature herself seems on the flitting.
3926,DECAY,"The fields grow old and common things,"
3927,DECAY,"The grass, the sky, the winds a-blowing;"
3928,DECAY,"And spots, where still a beauty clings,"
3929,DECAY,Are sighing “going! all a-going!”
3930,DECAY,"O Poesy in on the wane,"
3931,DECAY,I hardly know her face again.
3932,DECAY,
3933,DECAY,"The bank with brambles overspread,"
3934,DECAY,"And little molehills round about it,"
3935,DECAY,"Was more to me than laurel shades,"
3936,DECAY,With paths of gravel finely clouted;
3937,DECAY,"And streaking here and streaking there,"
3938,DECAY,"Through shaven grass and many a border,"
3939,DECAY,"With rutty lanes had no compare,"
3940,DECAY,And heaths were in a richer order.

3942,DECAY,I hardly know her face again.
3943,DECAY,
3944,DECAY,"I sat beside the pasture stream,"

3946,DECAY,"The fields did more than Eden seem,"

3948,DECAY,"I often drank when not a-dry,"

3958,DECAY,"Like groves, and rocks, and mottled fountains."
3959,DECAY,"Those heavens are gone, the mountains grey"
3960,DECAY,"Turned mist--the sun, a homeless ranger,"
3961,DECAY,"Pursues alone his naked way,"
3962,DECAY,Unnoticed like a very stranger.
3963,DECAY,"O Poesy is on the wane,"
3964,DECAY,Nor love nor joy is mine again.
3965,DECAY,
3966,DECAY,"Love’s sun went down without a frown,"
3967,DECAY,For very joy it used to grieve us;
3968,DECAY,"I often think the West is gone,"
3969,DECAY,"Ah, cruel Time, to undeceive us."
3970,DECAY,"The stream it is a common stream,"
3971,DECAY,"Where we on Sundays used to ramble,"
3972,DECAY,"The sky hangs o’er a broken dream,"
3973,DECAY,The bramble’s dwindled to a bramble!
3974,DECAY,"O Poesy is on the wane,"
3975,DECAY,I cannot find her haunts again.
3976,DECAY,
3977,DECAY,"Mere withered stalks and fading trees,"
3978,DECAY,"And pastures spread with hills and rushes,"
3979,DECAY,Are all my fading vision sees;
3980,DECAY,"Gone, gone are rapture’s flooding gushes!"
3981,DECAY,"When mushrooms they were fairy bowers,"
3982,DECAY,"Their marble pillars over-swelling,"
3983,DECAY,"And Danger paused to pluck the flowers,"
3984,DECAY,That in their swarthy rings were dwelling.
3985,DECAY,"Yes, Poesy is on the wane,"
3986,DECAY,"Nor joy, nor fear is mine again."
3987,DECAY,
3988,DECAY,"Aye, Poesy hath passed away,"
3989,DECAY,And Fancy’s visions undeceive us;
3990,DECAY,"The night hath ta’en the place of day,"
3991,DECAY,And why should passing shadows grieve us?
3992,DECAY,I thought the flowers upon the hill
3993,DECAY,Were flowers from Adam’s open gardens;
3994,DECAY,"But I have had my summer thrills,"
3995,DECAY,And I have had my heart’s rewardings.
3996,DECAY,"So Poesy is on the wane,"
3997,DECAY,I hardly know her face again.
3998,DECAY,
3999,DECAY,"And Friendship it hath burned away,"
4000,DECAY,"Like to a very ember cooling,"
4001,DECAY,"A make-believe on April day,"
4002,DECAY,That sent the simple heart a fooling;
4003,DECAY,"Mere jesting in an earnest way,"
4004,DECAY,Deceiving on and still deceiving;
4005,DECAY,"And Hope is but a fancy-play,"
4006,DECAY,And Joy the art of true believing;
4007,DECAY,"For Poesy is on the wane,"
4008,DECAY,O could I feel her faith again!

4095,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,And tiny whispering song to hear.
4096,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"While on the stile or garden seat,"
4097,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"I sit to watch the falling leaves,"
4098,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"The song thy little joys repeat,"
4099,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,My loneliness relieves.
4100,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,
4101,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,And many are the lonely minds
4102,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"That hear, and welcome thee anew;"
4103,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Not Taste alone, but humble hinds,"
4104,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Delight to praise, and love thee too."
4105,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"The veriest clown, beside his cart,"
4106,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Turns from his song with many a smile,"
4107,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"To see thee from the hedgerow start,"
4108,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,To sing upon the stile.
4109,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,
4110,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,The shepherd on the fallen tree
4111,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Drops down to listen to thy lay,"
4112,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"And chides his dog beside his knee,"
4113,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Who barks, and frightens thee away."
4114,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"The hedger pauses, ere he knocks"
4115,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,The stake down in the meadow-gap--
4116,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"The boy, who every songster mocks,"
4117,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Forbears the gate to clap.
4118,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,
4119,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,When in the hedge that hides the post
4120,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Thy ruddy bosom he surveys,--"
4121,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Pleased with thy song, in transport lost,"
4122,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,He pausing mutters scraps of praise.
4123,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"The maiden marks, at day’s decline,"
4124,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Thee in the yard, on broken plough,"
4125,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"And stops her song, to listen thine,"
4126,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Milking the brindled cow.
4127,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,
4128,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Thy simple faith in man’s esteem,"
4129,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,From every heart hath favour won;
4130,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Dangers to thee no dangers seem--
4131,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Thou seemest to court them more than shun.
4132,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"The clown in winter takes his gun,"
4133,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"The barn-door flocking birds to slay,"
4134,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Yet should’st thou in the danger run
4135,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,He turns the tube away.
4136,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,
4137,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"The gipsy boy, who seeks in glee"
4138,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Blackberries for a dainty meal,"
4139,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Laughs loud on first beholding thee,"
4140,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"When called, so near his presence steal."
4141,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,He surely thinks thou know’st the call;
4142,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,And though his hunger ill can spare
4143,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"The fruit, he will not pluck it all,"
4144,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,But leaves some to thy share.
4145,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,
4146,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Upon the ditcher’s spade thou’lt hop,"
4147,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,For grubs and wreathing worms to search;
4148,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Where woodmen in the forest chop,"
4149,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Thou’lt fearless on their faggots perch;
4150,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Nay, by the gipsies’ camp I stop,"
4151,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"And mark thee dwell a moment there,"
4152,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"To prune thy wing awhile, then drop,"
4153,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,The littered crumbs to share.
4154,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,
4155,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Domestic bird! thy pleasant face
4156,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Doth well thy common suit commend;
4157,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,To meet thee in a stranger-place
4158,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Is meeting with an ancient friend.
4159,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"I track the thicket’s glooms around,"
4160,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"And there, as loth to leave, again"
4161,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Thou comest, as if thou knew the sound"
4162,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,And loved the sight of men.
4163,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,
4164,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,The loneliest wood that man can trace
4165,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,To thee a pleasant dwelling gives;
4166,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,In every town and crowded place
4167,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,The sweet domestic robin lives.
4168,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Go where one will, in every spot"
4169,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Thy little welcome mates appear;
4170,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"And, like the daisy’s common lot,"
4171,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Thou’rt met with every where.
4172,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,
4173,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"The swallow in the chimney tier,"
4174,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Or twittering martin in the eaves,"
4175,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,With half of love and half of fear
4176,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,His mortared dwelling shily weaves;
4177,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,The sparrows in the thatch will shield;
4178,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Yet they, as well as e’er they can,"
4179,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Contrive with doubtful faith to build
4180,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Beyond the reach of man.
4181,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,
4182,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"But thou’rt less timid than the wren,"
4183,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Domestic and confiding bird!
4184,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"And spots, the nearest haunts of men,"
4185,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Are oftenest for thy home preferred.
4186,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"In garden-walls thou’lt build so low,"
4187,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Close where the bunch of fennel stands,"
4188,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,That e’en a child just taught to go
4189,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,May reach with tiny hands.
4190,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,
4191,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Sweet favoured bird! thy under-notes
4192,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"In summer’s music grow unknown,"
4193,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,The concert from a thousand throats
4194,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Leaves thee as if to pipe alone;
4195,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"No listening ear the shepherd lends,"
4196,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"The simple ploughman marks thee not,"
4197,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,And then by all thy autumn friends
4198,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Thou’rt missing and forgot.
4199,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,
4200,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"The far-famed nightingale, that shares"
4201,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Cold public praise from every tongue,"
4202,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"The popular voice of music heirs,"
4203,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,And injures much thy under-song:
4204,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Yet then my walks thy theme salutes;
4205,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"I find thee autumn’s favoured guest,"
4206,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Gay piping on the hazel-roots
4207,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Above thy mossy nest.
4208,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,
4209,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"’Tis wrong that thou shouldst be despised,"
4210,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,When these gay fickle birds appear;
4211,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,They sing when summer flowers are prized--
4212,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Thou at the dull and dying year.
4213,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Well! let the heedless and the gay
4214,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Bepraise the voice of louder lays,"
4215,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,The joy thou steal’st from Sorrow’s day
4216,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Is more to thee than praise.
4217,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,
4218,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"And could my notes win aught from thine,"
4219,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"My words but imitate thy lay,"
4220,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Time could not then his charge resign,"
4221,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"Nor throw the meanest verse away,"
4222,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"But ever at this mellow time,"
4223,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,"He should thy autumn praise prolong,"
4224,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,As they would share the happy prime
4225,THE AUTUMN ROBIN,Of thy eternal song.

4498,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS
4499,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,
4500,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,
4501,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,And has the Spring’s all-glorious eye
4502,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,No lesson to the mind?
4503,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,The birds that cleave the golden sky--
4504,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,Things to the earth resigned--
4505,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,Wild flowers that dance to every wind--
4506,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,Do they no memory leave behind?
4507,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,
4508,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"Aye, flowers! The very name of flowers,"
4509,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"That bloom in wood and glen,"
4510,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"Brings Spring to me in Winter’s hours,"
4511,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,And childhood’s dreams again.
4512,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,The primrose on the woodland lea
4513,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,Was more than gold and lands to me.
4514,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,
4515,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,The violets by the woodland side
4516,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,Are thick as they could thrive;
4517,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,I’ve talked to them with childish pride
4518,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,As things that were alive:
4519,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,I find them now in my distress--
4520,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"They seem as sweet, yet valueless."
4521,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,
4522,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"The cowslips on the meadow lea,"
4523,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,How have I run for them!
4524,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,I looked with wild and childish glee
4525,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,Upon each golden gem:
4526,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,And when they bowed their heads so shy
4527,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"I laughed, and thought they danced for joy."
4528,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,
4529,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"And when a man, in early years,"
4530,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"How sweet they used to come,"
4531,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"And give me tales of smiles and tears,"
4532,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,And thoughts more dear than home:
4533,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,Secrets which words would then reprove--
4534,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,They told the names of early love.
4535,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,
4536,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,The primrose turned a babbling flower
4537,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,Within its sweet recess:
4538,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"I blushed to see its secret bower,"
4539,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,And turned her name to bless.
4540,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,The violets said the eyes were blue:
4541,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"I loved, and did they tell me true?"
4542,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,
4543,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"The cowslips, blooming everywhere,"
4544,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,My heart’s own thoughts could steal:
4545,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,I nip’t them that they should not hear:
4546,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"They smiled, and would reveal;"
4547,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"And o’er each meadow, right or wrong,"
4548,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,They sing the name I’ve worshipped long.
4549,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,
4550,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,The brook that mirrored clear the sky--
4551,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,Full well I know the spot;
4552,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"The mouse-ear looked with bright blue eye,"
4553,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,And said “Forget-me-not.”
4554,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"And from the brook I turned away,"
4555,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,But heard it many an after day.
4556,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,
4557,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"The king-cup on its slender stalk,"
4558,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"Within the pasture dell,"
4559,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,Would picture there a pleasant walk
4560,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,With one I loved so well.
4561,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,It said “How sweet at eventide
4562,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"’Twould be, with true love at thy side.”"
4563,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,
4564,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,And on the pasture’s woody knoll
4565,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"I saw the wild bluebell,"
4566,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"On Sundays, where I used to stroll"
4567,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,With her I loved so well:
4568,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,She culled the flowers the year before;
4569,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"These bowed, and told the story o’er."
4570,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,
4571,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,And every flower that had a name
4572,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,Would tell me who was fair;
4573,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"But those without, as strangers, came"
4574,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,And blossomed silent there:
4575,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"I stood to hear, but all alone:"
4576,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,They bloomed and kept their thoughts unknown.
4577,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,
4578,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,"But seasons now have nought to say,"
4579,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,The flowers no news to bring:
4580,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,Alone I live from day to day--
4581,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,Flowers deck the bier of Spring;
4582,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,And birds upon the bush or tree
4583,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,All sing a different tale to me.
4584,THE TELL-TALE FLOWERS,

4588,TO JOHN MILTON,TO JOHN MILTON
4589,TO JOHN MILTON,
4590,TO JOHN MILTON,
4591,TO JOHN MILTON,"Poet of mighty power, I fain"
4592,TO JOHN MILTON,"Would court the muse that honoured thee,"
4593,TO JOHN MILTON,"And, like Elisha’s spirit, gain"
4594,TO JOHN MILTON,A part of thy intensity;
4595,TO JOHN MILTON,And share the mantle which she flung
4596,TO JOHN MILTON,"Around thee, when thy lyre was strung."
4597,TO JOHN MILTON,
4598,TO JOHN MILTON,"Though faction’s scorn at first did shun,"
4599,TO JOHN MILTON,"With coldness, thy inspired song,"
4600,TO JOHN MILTON,"Though clouds of malice pass’d thy sun,"
4601,TO JOHN MILTON,They could not hide it long;
4602,TO JOHN MILTON,Its brightness soon exhaled away
4603,TO JOHN MILTON,"Dark night, and gained eternal day."
4604,TO JOHN MILTON,
4605,TO JOHN MILTON,The critics’ wrath did darkly frown
4606,TO JOHN MILTON,Upon thy muse’s mighty lay;
4607,TO JOHN MILTON,But blasts that break the blossom down
4608,TO JOHN MILTON,Do only stir the bay;
4609,TO JOHN MILTON,"And thine shall flourish, green and long,"
4610,TO JOHN MILTON,In the eternity of song.
4611,TO JOHN MILTON,
4612,TO JOHN MILTON,"Thy genius saw, in quiet mood,"
4613,TO JOHN MILTON,"Gilt fashion’s follies pass thee by,"
4614,TO JOHN MILTON,"And, like the monarch of the wood,"
4615,TO JOHN MILTON,Tower’d o’er it to the sky;
4616,TO JOHN MILTON,"Where thou could’st sing of other spheres,"
4617,TO JOHN MILTON,And feel the fame of future years.
4618,TO JOHN MILTON,
4619,TO JOHN MILTON,Though bitter sneers and stinging scorns
4620,TO JOHN MILTON,"Did throng the Muse’s dangerous way,"
4621,TO JOHN MILTON,"Thy powers were past such little thorns,"
4622,TO JOHN MILTON,They gave thee no dismay;
4623,TO JOHN MILTON,"The scoffer’s insult pass’d thee by,"
4624,TO JOHN MILTON,Thou smild’st and mad’st him no reply.
4625,TO JOHN MILTON,
4626,TO JOHN MILTON,Envy will gnaw its heart away
4627,TO JOHN MILTON,To see thy genius gather root;
4628,TO JOHN MILTON,"And as its flowers their sweets display,"
4629,TO JOHN MILTON,Scorn’s malice shall be mute;
4630,TO JOHN MILTON,"Hornets that summer warmed to fly,"
4631,TO JOHN MILTON,Shall at the death of summer die.
4632,TO JOHN MILTON,
4633,TO JOHN MILTON,"Though friendly praise hath but its hour,"
4634,TO JOHN MILTON,And little praise with thee hath been;
4635,TO JOHN MILTON,"The bay may lose its summer flower,"
4636,TO JOHN MILTON,But still its leaves are green;
4637,TO JOHN MILTON,"And thine, whose buds are on the shoot,"
4638,TO JOHN MILTON,Shall only fade to change to fruit.
4639,TO JOHN MILTON,
4640,TO JOHN MILTON,"Fame lives not in the breath of words,"
4641,TO JOHN MILTON,In public praises’ hue and cry;
4642,TO JOHN MILTON,The music of these summer birds
4643,TO JOHN MILTON,"Is silent in a winter sky,"
4644,TO JOHN MILTON,"When thine shall live and flourish on,"
4645,TO JOHN MILTON,O’er wrecks where crowds of fames are gone.
4646,TO JOHN MILTON,
4647,TO JOHN MILTON,"The ivy shuns the city wall,"
4648,TO JOHN MILTON,"When busy-clamorous crowds intrude,"
4649,TO JOHN MILTON,And climbs the desolated hall
4650,TO JOHN MILTON,In silent solitude;
4651,TO JOHN MILTON,"The time-worn arch, the fallen dome,"
4652,TO JOHN MILTON,Are roots for its eternal home.
4653,TO JOHN MILTON,
4654,TO JOHN MILTON,The bard his glory ne’er receives
4655,TO JOHN MILTON,"Where summer’s common flowers are seen,"
4656,TO JOHN MILTON,But winter finds it when she leaves
4657,TO JOHN MILTON,The laurel only green;
4658,TO JOHN MILTON,"And time, from that eternal tree,"
4659,TO JOHN MILTON,Shall weave a wreath to honour thee.
4660,TO JOHN MILTON,
4661,TO JOHN MILTON,Nought but thy ashes shall expire;
4662,TO JOHN MILTON,"Thy genius, at thy obsequies,"
4663,TO JOHN MILTON,Shall kindle up its living fire
4664,TO JOHN MILTON,And light the Muse’s skies;
4665,TO JOHN MILTON,"Ay, it shall rise, and shine, and be"
4666,TO JOHN MILTON,A sun in song’s posterity.

4692,I AM! YET WHAT I AM,"Full of high thoughts, unborn. So let me lie,"
4693,I AM! YET WHAT I AM,The grass below; above the vaulted sky.
