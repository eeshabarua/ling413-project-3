562,THE PARTING HOUR.,And no mysterious void is left between.
563,THE PARTING HOUR.,"But let these binding links be all destroyed,"
564,THE PARTING HOUR.,"All that through years he suffer'd or enjoy'd,"
565,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Let that vast gap be made, and then behold -"
566,THE PARTING HOUR.,"This was the youth, and he is thus when old;"
567,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Then we at once the work of time survey,"
568,THE PARTING HOUR.,And in an instant see a life's decay;
569,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Pain mix'd with pity in our bosoms rise,"
570,THE PARTING HOUR.,And sorrow takes new sadness from surprise.
571,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Beneath yon tree, observe an ancient pair -"
572,THE PARTING HOUR.,"A sleeping man; a woman in her chair,"
573,THE PARTING HOUR.,Watching his looks with kind and pensive air;
574,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Nor wife, nor sister she, nor is the name"
575,THE PARTING HOUR.,Nor kindred of this friendly pair the same;
576,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Yet so allied are they, that few can feel"
577,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Her constant, warm, unwearied, anxious zeal;"
578,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Their years and woes, although they long have loved,"
579,THE PARTING HOUR.,Keep their good name and conduct unreproved:
580,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Thus life's small comforts they together share,"
581,THE PARTING HOUR.,And while life lingers for the grave prepare.
582,THE PARTING HOUR.,"No other subjects on their spirits press,"
583,THE PARTING HOUR.,Nor gain such int'rest as the past distress:
584,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Grievous events, that from the mem'ry drive"
585,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Life's common cares, and those alone survive,"
586,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Mix with each thought, in every action share,"
587,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Darken each dream, and blend with every prayer."
588,THE PARTING HOUR.,"To David Booth, his fourth and last-born boy,"
589,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Allen his name, was more than common joy;"
590,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And as the child grew up, there seem'd in him"
591,THE PARTING HOUR.,A more than common life in every limb;
592,THE PARTING HOUR.,"A strong and handsome stripling he became,"
593,THE PARTING HOUR.,And the gay spirit answer'd to the frame;
594,THE PARTING HOUR.,"A lighter, happier lad was never seen,"
595,THE PARTING HOUR.,"For ever easy, cheerful, or serene;"
596,THE PARTING HOUR.,His early love he fix'd upon a fair
597,THE PARTING HOUR.,And gentle maid--they were a handsome pair.
598,THE PARTING HOUR.,"They at an infant-school together play'd,"
599,THE PARTING HOUR.,Where the foundation of their love was laid:
600,THE PARTING HOUR.,The boyish champion would his choice attend
601,THE PARTING HOUR.,"In every sport, in every fray defend."
602,THE PARTING HOUR.,"As prospects open'd, and as life advanced,"
603,THE PARTING HOUR.,"They walk'd together, they together danced;"
604,THE PARTING HOUR.,"On all occasions, from their early years,"
605,THE PARTING HOUR.,"They mix'd their joys and sorrows, hopes and fears;"
606,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Each heart was anxious, till it could impart"
607,THE PARTING HOUR.,Its daily feelings to its kindred heart;
608,THE PARTING HOUR.,"As years increased, unnumber'd petty wars"
609,THE PARTING HOUR.,Broke out between them; jealousies and jars;
610,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Causeless indeed, and follow'd by a peace,"
611,THE PARTING HOUR.,"That gave to love--growth, vigour, and increase."
612,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Whilst yet a boy, when other minds are void,"
613,THE PARTING HOUR.,Domestic thoughts young Alien's hours employ'd.
614,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Judith in gaining hearts had no concern,"
615,THE PARTING HOUR.,Rather intent the matron's part to learn;
616,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Thus early prudent and sedate they grew,"
617,THE PARTING HOUR.,"While lovers, thoughtful--and though children, true."
618,THE PARTING HOUR.,"To either parents not a day appeard,"
619,THE PARTING HOUR.,When with this love they might have interfered.
620,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Childish at first, they cared not to restrain;"
621,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And strong at last, they saw restriction vain;"
622,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Nor knew they when that passion to reprove,"
623,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Now idle fondness, now resistless love."
624,THE PARTING HOUR.,"So while the waters rise, the children tread"
625,THE PARTING HOUR.,On the broad estuary's sandy bed;
626,THE PARTING HOUR.,"But soon the channel fills, from side to side"
627,THE PARTING HOUR.,Comes danger rolling with the deep'ning tide;
628,THE PARTING HOUR.,Yet none who saw the rapid current flow
629,THE PARTING HOUR.,Could the first instant of that danger know.
630,THE PARTING HOUR.,The lovers waited till the time should come
631,THE PARTING HOUR.,When they together could possess a home:
632,THE PARTING HOUR.,"In either house were men and maids unwed,"
633,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Hopes to be soothed, and tempers to be led."
634,THE PARTING HOUR.,Then Allen's mother of his favourite maid
635,THE PARTING HOUR.,Spoke from the feelings of a mind afraid:
636,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""Dress and amusements were her sole employ,"""
637,THE PARTING HOUR.,"She said--""entangling her deluded boy;"""
638,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And yet, in truth, a mother's jealous love"
639,THE PARTING HOUR.,Had much imagined and could little prove;
640,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Judith had beauty--and if vain, was kind,"
641,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Discreet and mild, and had a serious mind."
642,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Dull was their prospect.--When the lovers met,"
643,THE PARTING HOUR.,"They said, ""We must not--dare not venture yet."""
644,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""Oh! could I labour for thee,"" Allen cried,"
645,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""Why should our friends be thus dissatisfied;"
646,THE PARTING HOUR.,"On my own arm I could depend, but they"
647,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Still urge obedience--must I yet obey?"""
648,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Poor Judith felt the grief, but grieving begg'd delay."
649,THE PARTING HOUR.,"At length a prospect came that seem'd to smile,"
650,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And faintly woo them, from a Western Isle;"
651,THE PARTING HOUR.,"A kinsman there a widow's hand had gain'd,"
652,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""Was old, was rich, and childless yet remain'd;"
653,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Would some young Booth to his affairs attend,"
654,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And wait awhile, he might expect a friend."""
655,THE PARTING HOUR.,"The elder brothers, who were not in love,"
656,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Fear'd the false seas, unwilling to remove;"
657,THE PARTING HOUR.,"But the young Allen, an enamour'd boy,"
658,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Eager an independence to enjoy,"
659,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Would through all perils seek it,--by the sea, -"
660,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Through labour, danger, pain, or slavery."
661,THE PARTING HOUR.,"The faithful Judith his design approved,"
662,THE PARTING HOUR.,"For both were sanguine, they were young, and loved."
663,THE PARTING HOUR.,The mother's slow consent was then obtain'd;
664,THE PARTING HOUR.,"The time arrived, to part alone remain'd:"
665,THE PARTING HOUR.,"All things prepared, on the expected day"
666,THE PARTING HOUR.,Was seen the vessel anchor'd in the bay.
667,THE PARTING HOUR.,"From her would seamen in the evening come,"
668,THE PARTING HOUR.,To take th' adventurous Allen from his home;
669,THE PARTING HOUR.,"With his own friends the final day he pass'd,"
670,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And every painful hour, except the last."
671,THE PARTING HOUR.,"The grieving father urged the cheerful glass,"
672,THE PARTING HOUR.,To make the moments with less sorrow pass;
673,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Intent the mother look'd upon her son,"
674,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And wish'd th' assent withdrawn, the deed undone;"
675,THE PARTING HOUR.,"The younger sister, as he took his way,"
676,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Hung on his coat, and begg'd for more delay:"
677,THE PARTING HOUR.,"But his own Judith call'd him to the shore,"
678,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Whom he must meet, for they might meet no more; -"
679,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And there he found her--faithful, mournful, true,"
680,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Weeping, and waiting for a last adieu!"
681,THE PARTING HOUR.,"The ebbing tide had left the sand, and there"
682,THE PARTING HOUR.,Moved with slow steps the melancholy pair:
683,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Sweet were the painful moments--but, how sweet,"
684,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And without pain, when they again should meet!"
685,THE PARTING HOUR.,Now either spoke as hope and fear impress'd
686,THE PARTING HOUR.,Each their alternate triumph in the breast.
687,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Distance alarm'd the maid--she cried, ""'Tis far!"""
688,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And danger too--""it is a time of war:"
689,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Then in those countries are diseases strange,"
690,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And women gay, and men are prone to change:"
691,THE PARTING HOUR.,"What then may happen in a year, when things"
692,THE PARTING HOUR.,Of vast importance every moment brings!
693,THE PARTING HOUR.,"But hark! an oar!"" she cried, yet none appear'd -"
694,THE PARTING HOUR.,"'Twas love's mistake, who fancied what it fear'd;"
695,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And she continued--""Do, my Allen, keep"
696,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Thy heart from evil, let thy passions sleep;"
697,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Believe it good, nay glorious, to prevail,"
698,THE PARTING HOUR.,And stand in safety where so many fail;
699,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And do not, Allen, or for shame, or pride,"
700,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Thy faith abjure, or thy profession hide;"
701,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Can I believe his love will lasting prove,"
702,THE PARTING HOUR.,Who has no rev'rence for the God I love?
703,THE PARTING HOUR.,I know thee well! how good thou art and kind;
704,THE PARTING HOUR.,But strong the passions that invade thy mind -
705,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Now, what to me hath Allen, to commend?"""
706,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""Upon my mother,"" said the youth,"" attend;"
707,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Forget her spleen, and, in my place appear,"
708,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Her love to me will make my Judith dear,"
709,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Oft I shall think (such comforts lovers seek),"
710,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Who speaks of me, and fancy what they speak;"
711,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Then write on all occasions, always dwell"
712,THE PARTING HOUR.,"On hope's fair prospects, and be kind and well,"
713,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And ever choose the fondest, tenderest style."""
714,THE PARTING HOUR.,"She answer'd, ""No,"" but answer'd with a smile."
715,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""And now, my Judith, at so sad a time,"
716,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Forgive my fear, and call it not my crime;"
717,THE PARTING HOUR.,When with our youthful neighbours 'tis thy chance
718,THE PARTING HOUR.,"To meet in walks, the visit, or the dance,"
719,THE PARTING HOUR.,"When every lad would on my lass attend,"
720,THE PARTING HOUR.,Choose not a smooth designer for a friend:
721,THE PARTING HOUR.,"That fawning Philip!--nay, be not severe,"
722,THE PARTING HOUR.,"A rival's hope must cause a lover's fear."""
723,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Displeased she felt, and might in her reply"
724,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Have mix'd some anger, but the boat was nigh,"
725,THE PARTING HOUR.,Now truly heard!--it soon was full in sight; -
726,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Now the sad farewell, and the long good-night;"
727,THE PARTING HOUR.,"For see!--his friends come hast'ning to the beach,"
728,THE PARTING HOUR.,And now the gunwale is within the reach:
729,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""Adieu!--farewell!--remember!""--and what more"
730,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Affection taught, was utter'd from the shore."
731,THE PARTING HOUR.,"But Judith left them with a heavy heart,"
732,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Took a last view, and went to weep apart."
733,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And now his friends went slowly from the place,"
734,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Where she stood still, the dashing oar to trace,"
735,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Till all were silent!--for the youth she pray'd,"
736,THE PARTING HOUR.,And softly then return'd the weeping maid.
737,THE PARTING HOUR.,"They parted, thus by hope and fortune led,"
738,THE PARTING HOUR.,And Judith's hours in pensive pleasure fled;
739,THE PARTING HOUR.,But when return'd the youth?--the youth no more
740,THE PARTING HOUR.,Return'd exulting to his native shore;
741,THE PARTING HOUR.,"But forty years were past, and then there came"
742,THE PARTING HOUR.,"A worn-out man with wither'd limbs and lame,"
743,THE PARTING HOUR.,"His mind oppress'd with woes, and bent with age his frame."
744,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Yes! old and grieved, and trembling with decay,"
745,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Was Allen landing in his native bay,"
746,THE PARTING HOUR.,Willing his breathless form should blend with kindred clay.
747,THE PARTING HOUR.,"In an autumnal eve he left the beach,"
748,THE PARTING HOUR.,In such an eve he chanced the port to reach:
749,THE PARTING HOUR.,He was alone; he press'd the very place
750,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Of the sad parting, of the last embrace:"
751,THE PARTING HOUR.,"There stood his parents, there retired the maid,"
752,THE PARTING HOUR.,"So fond, so tender, and so much afraid;"
753,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And on that spot, through many years, his mind"
754,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Turn'd mournful back, half sinking, half resign'd."
755,THE PARTING HOUR.,"No one was present; of its crew bereft,"
756,THE PARTING HOUR.,A single boat was in the billows left;
757,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Sent from some anchor'd vessel in the bay,"
758,THE PARTING HOUR.,At the returning tide to sail away.
759,THE PARTING HOUR.,"O'er the black stern the moonlight softly play'd,"
760,THE PARTING HOUR.,The loosen'd foresail flapping in the shade;
761,THE PARTING HOUR.,All silent else on shore; but from the town
762,THE PARTING HOUR.,A drowsy peal of distant bells came down:
763,THE PARTING HOUR.,"From the tall houses here and there, a light"
764,THE PARTING HOUR.,Served some confused remembrance to excite:
765,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""There,"" he observed, and new emotions felt,"
766,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""Was my first home--and yonder Judith dwelt;"
767,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Dead! dead are all! I long--I fear to know,"""
768,THE PARTING HOUR.,"He said, and walk'd impatient, and yet slow."
769,THE PARTING HOUR.,Sudden there broke upon his grief a noise
770,THE PARTING HOUR.,Of merry tumult and of vulgar joys:
771,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Seamen returning to their ship, were come,"
772,THE PARTING HOUR.,With idle numbers straying from their home;
773,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Allen among them mix'd, and in the old"
774,THE PARTING HOUR.,Strove some familiar features to behold;
775,THE PARTING HOUR.,"While fancy aided memory: --""Man! what cheer?"""
776,THE PARTING HOUR.,"A sailor cried; ""Art thou at anchor here?"""
777,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Faintly he answer'd, and then tried to trace"
778,THE PARTING HOUR.,Some youthful features in some aged face:
779,THE PARTING HOUR.,"A swarthy matron he beheld, and thought"
780,THE PARTING HOUR.,She might unfold the very truths he sought:
781,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Confused and trembling, he the dame address'd:"
782,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""The Booths! yet live they?"" pausing and oppress'd;"
783,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Then spake again: --""Is there no ancient man,"
784,THE PARTING HOUR.,"David his name?--assist me, if you can. -"
785,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Flemings there were--and Judith, doth she live?"""
786,THE PARTING HOUR.,"The woman gazed, nor could an answer give,'"
787,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Yet wond'ring stood, and all were silent by,"
788,THE PARTING HOUR.,Feeling a strange and solemn sympathy.
789,THE PARTING HOUR.,"The woman musing said--""She knew full well"
790,THE PARTING HOUR.,Where the old people came at last to dwell;
791,THE PARTING HOUR.,"They had a married daughter, and a son,"
792,THE PARTING HOUR.,"But they were dead, and now remain'd not one."""
793,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""Yes,"" said an elder, who had paused intent"
794,THE PARTING HOUR.,"On days long past, ""there was a sad event; -"
795,THE PARTING HOUR.,One of these Booths--it was my mother's tale -
796,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Here left his lass, I know not where to sail:"
797,THE PARTING HOUR.,"She saw their parting, and observed the pain;"
798,THE PARTING HOUR.,"But never came th' unhappy man again:"""
799,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""The ship was captured""--Allen meekly said,"
800,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""And what became of the forsaken maid?"""
801,THE PARTING HOUR.,"The woman answer'd:  ""I remember now,"
802,THE PARTING HOUR.,"She used to tell the lasses of her vow,"
803,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And of her lover's loss, and I have seen"
804,THE PARTING HOUR.,The gayest hearts grow sad where she bas been;
805,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Yet in her grief she married, and was made"
806,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Slave to a wretch, whom meekly she obey'd,"
807,THE PARTING HOUR.,And early buried--but I know no more:
808,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And hark! our friends are hast'ning to the shore."""
809,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Allen soon found a lodging in the town,"
810,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And walk'd a man unnoticed up and down,"
811,THE PARTING HOUR.,"This house, and this, he knew, and thought a face"
812,THE PARTING HOUR.,He sometimes could among a number trace:
813,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Of names remember'd there remain'd a few,"
814,THE PARTING HOUR.,"But of no favourites, and the rest were new:"
815,THE PARTING HOUR.,"A merchant's wealth, when Allen went to sea,"
816,THE PARTING HOUR.,Was reckon'd boundless.--Could he living be?
817,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Or lived his son? for one he had, the heir"
818,THE PARTING HOUR.,"To a vast business, and a fortune fair."
819,THE PARTING HOUR.,"No! but that heir's poor widow, from her shed,"
820,THE PARTING HOUR.,With crutches went to take her dole of bread:
821,THE PARTING HOUR.,"There was a friend whom he had left a boy,"
822,THE PARTING HOUR.,With hope to sail the master of a hoy;
823,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Him, after many a stormy day, he found"
824,THE PARTING HOUR.,"With his great wish, his life's whole purpose, crown'd."
825,THE PARTING HOUR.,"This hoy's proud captain look'd in Allen's face, -"
826,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""Yours is, my friend,"" said he, ""a woeful case;"
827,THE PARTING HOUR.,We cannot all succeed:  I now command
828,THE PARTING HOUR.,"The Betsy sloop, and am not much at land:"
829,THE PARTING HOUR.,"But when we meet, you shall your story tell"
830,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Of foreign parts--I bid you now farewell!"""
831,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Allen so long had left his native shore,"
832,THE PARTING HOUR.,He saw but few whom he had seen before;
833,THE PARTING HOUR.,"The older people, as they met him, cast"
834,THE PARTING HOUR.,"A pitying look, oft speaking as they pass'd -"
835,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""The man is Allen Booth, and it appears"
836,THE PARTING HOUR.,He dwelt among us in his early years:
837,THE PARTING HOUR.,"We see the name engraved upon the stones,"
838,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Where this poor wanderer means to lay his bones,"""
839,THE PARTING HOUR.,Thus where he lived and loved--unhappy change! -
840,THE PARTING HOUR.,"He seems a stranger, and finds all are strange."
841,THE PARTING HOUR.,"But now a widow, in a village near,"
842,THE PARTING HOUR.,Chanced of the melancholy man to hear;
843,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Old as she was, to Judith's bosom came"
844,THE PARTING HOUR.,Some strong emotions at the well-known name;
845,THE PARTING HOUR.,"He was her much-loved Allen, she had stay'd"
846,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Ten troubled years, a sad afflicted maid;"
847,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Then was she wedded, of his death assured."
848,THE PARTING HOUR.,And much of mis'ry in her lot endured;
849,THE PARTING HOUR.,Her husband died; her children sought their bread
850,THE PARTING HOUR.,"In various places, and to her were dead."
851,THE PARTING HOUR.,"The once fond lovers met; not grief nor age,"
852,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Sickness nor pain, their hearts could disengage:"
853,THE PARTING HOUR.,Each had immediate confidence; a friend
854,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Both now beheld, on whom they might depend:"
855,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""Now is there one to whom I can express"
856,THE PARTING HOUR.,"My nature's weakness, and my soul's distress."""
857,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Allen look'd up, and with impatient heart -"
858,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""Let me not lose thee--never let us part:"
859,THE PARTING HOUR.,"So heaven this comfort to my sufferings give,"
860,THE PARTING HOUR.,"It is not all distress to think and live."""
861,THE PARTING HOUR.,Thus Allen spoke--for time had not removed
862,THE PARTING HOUR.,The charms attach'd to one so fondly loved;
863,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Who with more health, the mistress of their cot,"
864,THE PARTING HOUR.,Labours to soothe the evils of his lot.
865,THE PARTING HOUR.,"To her, to her alone, his various fate,"
866,THE PARTING HOUR.,"At various times, 'tis comfort to relate;"
867,THE PARTING HOUR.,And yet his sorrow--she too loves to hear
868,THE PARTING HOUR.,"What wrings her bosom, and compels the tear."
869,THE PARTING HOUR.,"First he related how he left the shore,"
870,THE PARTING HOUR.,Alarm'd with fears that they should meet no more.
871,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Then, ere the ship had reach'd her purposed course,"
872,THE PARTING HOUR.,They met and yielded to the Spanish force;
873,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Then 'cross th' Atlantic seas they bore their prey,"
874,THE PARTING HOUR.,Who grieving landed from their sultry bay:
875,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And marching many a burning league, he found"
876,THE PARTING HOUR.,Himself a slave upon a miner's ground:
877,THE PARTING HOUR.,"There a good priest his native language spoke,"
878,THE PARTING HOUR.,And gave some ease to his tormenting yoke;
879,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Kindly advanced him in his master's grace,"
880,THE PARTING HOUR.,And he was station'd in an easier place;
881,THE PARTING HOUR.,"There, hopeless ever to escape the land,"
882,THE PARTING HOUR.,He to a Spanish maiden gave his hand;
883,THE PARTING HOUR.,"In cottage shelter'd from the blaze of day,"
884,THE PARTING HOUR.,He saw his happy infants round him play;
885,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Where summer shadows, made by lofty trees,"
886,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Waved o'er his seat, and soothed his reveries;"
887,THE PARTING HOUR.,"E'en then he thought of England, nor could sigh,"
888,THE PARTING HOUR.,"But his fond Isabel demanded, ""Why?"""
889,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Grieved by the story, she the sigh repaid,"
890,THE PARTING HOUR.,And wept in pity for the English maid:
891,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Thus twenty years were pass d, and pass'd his views"
892,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Of further bliss, for he had wealth to lose:"
893,THE PARTING HOUR.,"His friend now dead, some foe had dared to paint"
894,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""His faith as tainted:  he his spouse would taint;"
895,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Make all his children infidels, and found"
896,THE PARTING HOUR.,"An English heresy on Christian ground."""
897,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""Whilst I was poor,"" said Allen, ""none would care"
898,THE PARTING HOUR.,What my poor notions of religion were;
899,THE PARTING HOUR.,"None ask'd me whom I worshipp'd, how I pray'd,"
900,THE PARTING HOUR.,If due obedience to the laws were paid:
901,THE PARTING HOUR.,"My good adviser taught me to be still,"
902,THE PARTING HOUR.,Nor to make converts had I power or will.
903,THE PARTING HOUR.,"I preach'd no foreign doctrine to my wife,"
904,THE PARTING HOUR.,And never mention'd Luther in my life;
905,THE PARTING HOUR.,"I, all they said, say what they would, allow'd,"
906,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And when the fathers bade me bow, I bow'd;"
907,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Their forms I follow'd, whether well or sick,"
908,THE PARTING HOUR.,And was a most obedient Catholic.
909,THE PARTING HOUR.,"But I had money, and these pastors found"
910,THE PARTING HOUR.,"My notions vague, heretical, unsound:"
911,THE PARTING HOUR.,A wicked book they seized; the very Turk
912,THE PARTING HOUR.,Could not have read a more pernicious work;
913,THE PARTING HOUR.,"To me pernicious, who if it were good"
914,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Or evil question'd not, nor understood:"
915,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Oh! had I little but the book possess'd,"
916,THE PARTING HOUR.,"I might have read it, and enjoy'd my rest."""
917,THE PARTING HOUR.,Alas! poor Allen--through his wealth was seen
918,THE PARTING HOUR.,Crimes that by poverty conceal'd had been:
919,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Faults that in dusty pictures rest unknown,"
920,THE PARTING HOUR.,Are in an instant through the varnish shown.
921,THE PARTING HOUR.,"He told their cruel mercy; how at last,"
922,THE PARTING HOUR.,"In Christian kindness for the merits past,"
923,THE PARTING HOUR.,"They spared his forfeit life, but bade him fly,"
924,THE PARTING HOUR.,Or for his crime and contumacy die;
925,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Fly from all scenes, all objects of delight:"
926,THE PARTING HOUR.,"His wife, his children, weeping in his sight,"
927,THE PARTING HOUR.,"All urging him to flee, he fled, and cursed his flight."
928,THE PARTING HOUR.,"He next related how he found a way,"
929,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Guideless and grieving, to Campeachy-Bay:"
930,THE PARTING HOUR.,"There in the woods he wrought, and there, among"
931,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Some lab'ring seamen, heard his native tongue:"
932,THE PARTING HOUR.,"The sound, one moment, broke upon his pain"
933,THE PARTING HOUR.,With joyful force; he long'd to hear again:
934,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Again he heard; he seized an offer'd hand,"
935,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""And when beheld you last our native land!"""
936,THE PARTING HOUR.,"He cried, ""and in what country? quickly say."""
937,THE PARTING HOUR.,The seamen answer'd--strangers all were they;
938,THE PARTING HOUR.,Only one at his native port had been;
939,THE PARTING HOUR.,"He, landing once, the quay and church had seen,"
940,THE PARTING HOUR.,For that esteem'd; but nothing more he knew.
941,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Still more to know, would Allen join the crew,"
942,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Sail where they sail'd, and, many a peril past,"
943,THE PARTING HOUR.,They at his kinsman's isle their anchor cast;
944,THE PARTING HOUR.,"But him they found not, nor could one relate"
945,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Aught of his will, his wish, or his estate."
946,THE PARTING HOUR.,This grieved not Allen; then again he sail'd
947,THE PARTING HOUR.,"For England's coast, again his fate prevailed:"
948,THE PARTING HOUR.,"War raged, and he, an active man and strong,"
949,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Was soon impress'd, and served his country long."
950,THE PARTING HOUR.,"By various shores he pass'd, on various seas,"
951,THE PARTING HOUR.,Never so happy as when void of ease. -
952,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And then he told how in a calm distress'd,"
953,THE PARTING HOUR.,Day after day his soul was sick of rest;
954,THE PARTING HOUR.,"When, as a log upon the deep they stood,"
955,THE PARTING HOUR.,Then roved his spirit to the inland wood;
956,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Till, while awake, he dream'd, that on the seas"
957,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Were his loved home, the hill, the stream, the trees:"
958,THE PARTING HOUR.,"He gazed, he pointed to the scenes: --""There stand"
959,THE PARTING HOUR.,"My wife, my children, 'tis my lovely land."
960,THE PARTING HOUR.,See! there my dwelling--oh! delicious scene
961,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Of my best life: --unhand me--are ye men?"""
962,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And thus the frenzy ruled him, till the wind"
963,THE PARTING HOUR.,Brush'd the fond pictures from the stagnant mind.
964,THE PARTING HOUR.,"He told of bloody fights, and how at length"
965,THE PARTING HOUR.,The rage of battle gave his spirits strength:
966,THE PARTING HOUR.,"'Twas in the Indian seas his limb he lost,"
967,THE PARTING HOUR.,And he was left half-dead upon the coast;
968,THE PARTING HOUR.,"But living gain'd, 'mid rich aspiring men,"
969,THE PARTING HOUR.,A fair subsistence by his ready pen.
970,THE PARTING HOUR.,"""Thus,"" he continued, ""pass'd unvaried years,"
971,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Without events producing hopes or fears."""
972,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Augmented pay procured him decent wealth,"
973,THE PARTING HOUR.,But years advancing undermined his health;
974,THE PARTING HOUR.,Then oft-times in delightful dream he flew
975,THE PARTING HOUR.,"To England's shore, and scenes his childhood knew:"
976,THE PARTING HOUR.,"He saw his parents, saw his fav'rite maid,"
977,THE PARTING HOUR.,"No feature wrinkled, not a charm decay'd;"
978,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And thus excited, in his bosom rose"
979,THE PARTING HOUR.,"A wish so strong, it baffled his repose:"
980,THE PARTING HOUR.,Anxious he felt on English earth to lie;
981,THE PARTING HOUR.,"To view his native soil, and there to die."
982,THE PARTING HOUR.,"He then described the gloom, the dread he found,"
983,THE PARTING HOUR.,"When first he landed on the chosen ground,"
984,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Where undefined was all he hoped and fear'd,"
985,THE PARTING HOUR.,And how confused and troubled all appear'd;
986,THE PARTING HOUR.,"His thoughts in past and present scenes employ'd,"
987,THE PARTING HOUR.,All views in future blighted and destroy'd:
988,THE PARTING HOUR.,"His were a medley of be wild'ring themes,"
989,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Sad as realities, and wild as dreams."
990,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Here his relation closes, but his mind"
991,THE PARTING HOUR.,Flies back again some resting-place to find;
992,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Thus silent, musing through the day, he sees"
993,THE PARTING HOUR.,"His children sporting by those lofty trees,"
994,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Their mother singing in the shady scene,"
995,THE PARTING HOUR.,Where the fresh springs burst o'er the lively green; -
996,THE PARTING HOUR.,"So strong his eager fancy, he affrights"
997,THE PARTING HOUR.,The faithful widow by its powerful flights;
998,THE PARTING HOUR.,"For what disturbs him he aloud will tell,"
999,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And cry--""'Tis she, my wife! my Isabel!"
1000,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Where are my children?""--Judith grieves to hear"
1001,THE PARTING HOUR.,How the soul works in sorrows so severe;
1002,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Assiduous all his wishes to attend,"
1003,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Deprived of much, he yet may boast a friend;"
1004,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Watch'd by her care, in sleep, his spirit takes"
1005,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Its flight, and watchful finds her when he wakes."
1006,THE PARTING HOUR.,'Tis now her office; her attention see!
1007,THE PARTING HOUR.,"While her friend sleeps beneath that shading tree,"
1008,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Careful, she guards him from the glowing heat,"
1009,THE PARTING HOUR.,And pensive muses at her Allen's feet.
1010,THE PARTING HOUR.,And where is he?  Ah! doubtless in those scenes
1011,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Of his best days, amid the vivid greens."
1012,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Fresh with unnumber'd rills, where ev'ry gale"
1013,THE PARTING HOUR.,Breathes the rich fragrance of the neighb'ring vale.
1014,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Smiles not his wife, and listens as there comes"
1015,THE PARTING HOUR.,The night-bird's music from the thick'ning glooms?
1016,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And as he sits with all these treasures nigh,"
1017,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Blaze not with fairy-light the phosphor-fly,"
1018,THE PARTING HOUR.,When like a sparkling gem it wheels illumined by?
1019,THE PARTING HOUR.,This is the joy that now so plainly speaks
1020,THE PARTING HOUR.,In the warm transient flushing of his cheeks;
1021,THE PARTING HOUR.,For he is list'ning to the fancied noise
1022,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Of his own children, eager in their joys:"
1023,THE PARTING HOUR.,"All this he feels, a dream's delusive bliss"
1024,THE PARTING HOUR.,"Gives the expression, and the glow like this."
1025,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And now his Judith lays her knitting by,"
1026,THE PARTING HOUR.,These strong emotions in her friend to spy
1027,THE PARTING HOUR.,For she can fully of their nature deem -
1028,THE PARTING HOUR.,"But see! he breaks the long protracted theme,"
1029,THE PARTING HOUR.,"And wakes, and cries--""My God! 'twas but a dream."""

1058,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,-------------------
1059,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,
1060,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Gwyn was a farmer, whom the farmers all,"
1061,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Who dwelt around, ""the Gentleman"" would call;"
1062,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Whether in pure humility or pride,"
1063,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"They only knew, and they would not decide."
1064,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Far different he from that dull plodding tribe
1065,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Whom it was his amusement to describe;
1066,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Creatures no more enliven'd than a clod,"
1067,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,But treading still as their dull fathers trod;
1068,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Who lived in times when not a man had seen
1069,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Corn sown by drill, or thresh'd by a machine!"
1070,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,He was of those whose skill assigns the prize
1071,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"For creatures fed in pens, and stalls, and sties;"
1072,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And who, in places where improvers meet,"
1073,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"To fill the land with fatness, had a seat;"
1074,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Who in large mansions live like petty kings,"
1075,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And speak of farms but as amusing things;
1076,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Who plans encourage, and who journals keep,"
1077,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And talk with lords about a breed of sheep.
1078,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Two are the species in this genus known;
1079,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"One, who is rich in his profession grown,"
1080,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Who yearly finds his ample stores increase,"
1081,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,From fortune's favours and a favouring lease;
1082,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Who rides his hunter, who his house adorns;"
1083,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Who drinks his wine, and his disbursements scorns;"
1084,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Who freely lives, and loves to show he can, -"
1085,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,This is the Farmer made the Gentleman.
1086,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The second species from the world is sent,"
1087,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Tired with its strife, or with his wealth content;"
1088,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,In books and men beyond the former read
1089,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"To farming solely by a passion led,"
1090,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Or by a fashion; curious in his land;
1091,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Now planning much, now changing what he plann'd;"
1092,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Pleased by each trial, not by failures vex'd,"
1093,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And ever certain to succeed the next;
1094,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Quick to resolve, and easy to persuade, -"
1095,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"This is the Gentleman, a farmer made."
1096,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Gwyn was of these; he from the world withdrew
1097,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Early in life, his reasons known to few;"
1098,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Some disappointments said, some pure good sense,"
1099,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The love of land, the press of indolence;"
1100,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"His fortune known, and coming to retire,"
1101,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"If not a Farmer, men had call'd him 'Squire."
1102,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Forty and five his years, no child or wife"
1103,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Cross'd the still tenour of his chosen life;
1104,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Much land he purchased, planted far around,"
1105,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And let some portions of superfluous ground
1106,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"To farmers near him, not displeased to say"
1107,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""My tenants,"" nor ""our worthy landlord,"" they."
1108,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Fix'd in his farm, he soon display'd his skill"
1109,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"In small-boned lambs, the horse-hoe, and the drill;"
1110,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"From these he rose to themes of nobler kind,"
1111,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And show'd the riches of a fertile mind;
1112,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,To all around their visits he repaid
1113,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And thus his mansion and himself display'd.
1114,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"His rooms were stately, rather fine than neat,"
1115,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And guests politely call'd his house a Seat;
1116,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"At much expense was each apartment graced,"
1117,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"His taste was gorgeous, but it still was taste;"
1118,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"In full festoons the crimson curtains fell,"
1119,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,The sofas rose in bold elastic swell;
1120,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Mirrors in gilded frames display'd the tints
1121,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Of glowing carpets and of colour'd prints:
1122,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The weary eye saw every object shine,"
1123,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And all was costly, fanciful, and fine."
1124,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"As with his friends he pass'd the social hours,"
1125,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,His generous spirit scorn'd to hide its powers;
1126,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Powers unexpected, for his eye and air"
1127,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Gave no sure signs that eloquence was there;
1128,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Oft he began with sudden fire and force,"
1129,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,As loth to lose occasion for discourse;
1130,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Some, 'tis observed, who feel a wish to speak,"
1131,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Will a due place for introduction seek;
1132,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"On to their purpose step by step they steal,"
1133,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And all their way, by certain signals, feel;"
1134,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Others plunge in at once, and never heed"
1135,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Whose turn they take, whose purpose they impede;"
1136,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Resolved to shine, they hasten to begin,"
1137,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Of ending thoughtless--and of these was Gwyn.
1138,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And thus he spake:  -
1139,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""It grieves me to the soul,"
1140,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,To see how man submits to man's control;
1141,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,How overpower'd and shackled minds are led
1142,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"In vulgar tracks, and to submission bred;"
1143,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The coward never on himself relies,"
1144,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,But to an equal for assistance flies;
1145,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Man yields to custom, as he bows to fate,"
1146,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"In all things ruled--mind, body, and estate;"
1147,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"In pain, in sickness, we for cure apply"
1148,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"To them we know not, and we know not why;"
1149,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"But that the creature has some jargon read,"
1150,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And got some Scotchman's system in his head;
1151,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Some grave impostor, who will health ensure,"
1152,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Long as your patience or your wealth endure,"
1153,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"But mark them well, the pale and sickly crew,"
1154,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"They have not health, and can they give it you?"
1155,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"These solemn cheats their various methods choose,"
1156,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"A system fires them, as a bard his muse:"
1157,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Hence wordy wars arise; the learn'd divide,"
1158,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And groaning patients curse each erring guide.
1159,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""Next, our affairs are govern'd, buy or sell,"
1160,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Upon the deed the law must fix its spell;
1161,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Whether we hire or let, we must have still"
1162,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,The dubious aid of an attorney's skill;
1163,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"They take a part in every man's affairs,"
1164,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And in all business some concern is theirs;
1165,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Because mankind in ways prescribed are found
1166,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Like flocks that follow on a beaten ground.
1167,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Each abject nature in the way proceeds,"
1168,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"That now to shearing, now to slaughter leads."
1169,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Should you offend, though meaning no offence,"
1170,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,You have no safety in your innocence;
1171,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The statute broken then is placed in view,"
1172,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And men must pay for crimes they never knew;
1173,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Who would by law regain his plunder'd store,"
1174,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Would pick up fallen merc'ry from the floor;
1175,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"If he pursue it, here and there it slides,"
1176,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"He would collect it, but it more divides;"
1177,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"This part and this he stops, but still in vain,"
1178,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"It slips aside, and breaks in parts again;"
1179,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Till, after time and pains, and care and cost,"
1180,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,He finds his labour and his object lost.
1181,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"But most it grieves me (friends alone are round),"
1182,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,To see a man in priestly fetters bound;
1183,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Guides to the soul, these friends of Heaven contrive,"
1184,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Long as man lives, to keep his fears alive:"
1185,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Soon as an infant breathes, their rites begin;"
1186,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Who knows not sinning, must be freed from sin;"
1187,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Who needs no bond, must yet engage in vows;"
1188,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Who has no judgment, must a creed espouse:"
1189,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Advanced in life, our boys are bound by rules,"
1190,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Are catechised in churches, cloisters, schools,"
1191,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And train'd in thraldom to be fit for tools:
1192,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The youth grown up, he now a partner needs,"
1193,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And lo! a priest, as soon as he succeeds."
1194,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,What man of sense can marriage-rites approve?
1195,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,What man of spirit can be bound to love?
1196,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Forced to be kind! compell'd to be sincere!
1197,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Do chains and fetters make companions dear?
1198,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Pris'ners indeed we bind; but though the bond
1199,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"May keep them safe, it does not make them fond:"
1200,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The ring, the vow, the witness, licence, prayers,"
1201,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,All parties known! made public all affairs!
1202,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Such forms men suffer, and from these they date"
1203,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,A deed of love begun with all they hate:
1204,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Absurd! that none the beaten road should shun,"
1205,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,But love to do what other dupes have done.
1206,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""Well, now your priest has made you one of twain,"
1207,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Look you for rest?  Alas! you look in vain.
1208,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"If sick, he comes; you cannot die in peace,"
1209,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Till he attends to witness your release;
1210,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"To vex your soul, and urge you to confess"
1211,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The sins you feel, remember, or can guess;"
1212,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Nay, when departed, to your grave he goes -"
1213,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,But there indeed he hurts not your repose.
1214,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""Such are our burthens; part we must sustain,"
1215,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,But need not link new grievance to the chain:
1216,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Yet men like idiots will their frames surround
1217,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"With these vile shackles, nor confess they're bound;"
1218,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"In all that most confines them they confide,"
1219,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Their slavery boast, and make their bonds their pride;"
1220,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"E'en as the pressure galls them, they declare"
1221,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,(Good souls!) how happy and how free they are!
1222,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"As madmen, pointing round their wretched cells,"
1223,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Cry, 'Lo! the palace where our honour dwells.'"
1224,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""Such is our state:  but I resolve to live"
1225,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,By rules my reason and my feelings give;
1226,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"No legal guards shall keep enthrall'd my mind,"
1227,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"No Slaves command me, and no teachers blind."
1228,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Tempted by sins, let me their strength defy,"
1229,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,But have no second in a surplice by;
1230,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"No bottle-holder, with officious aid,"
1231,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"To comfort conscience, weaken'd and afraid:"
1232,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Then if I yield, my frailty is not known;"
1233,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And, if I stand, the glory is my own."
1234,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""When Truth and Reason are our friends, we seem"
1235,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Alive! awake!--the superstitious dream.
1236,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Oh! then, fair truth, for thee alone I seek,"
1237,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Friend to the wise, supporter of the weak;"
1238,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,From thee we learn whate'er is right and just:
1239,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Forms to despise, professions to distrust;"
1240,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Creeds to reject, pretensions to deride,"
1241,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And, following thee, to follow none beside."""
1242,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Such was the speech:  it struck upon the ear
1243,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Like sudden thunder none expect to hear.
1244,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"He saw men's wonder with a manly pride,"
1245,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And gravely smiled at guest electrified.
1246,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""A farmer this!"" they said, ""Oh! let him seek"
1247,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,That place where he may for his country speak;
1248,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"On some great question to harangue for hours,"

1255,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And lighter verse to spur the languid powers;
1256,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"There metaphysics, logic there had place;"
1257,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,But of devotion not a single trace -
1258,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Save what is taught in Gibbon's florid page,"
1259,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And other guides of this inquiring age.
1260,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"There Hume appear'd, and near a splendid book"

1262,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"With these were mix'd the light, the free, the vain,"
1263,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And from a corner peep'd the sage Tom Paine;
1264,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Here four neat volumes Chesterfield were named,"
1265,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,For manners much and easy morals famed;
1266,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"With chaste Memoirs of females, to be read"
1267,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,When deeper studies had confused the head.
1268,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Such his resources, treasures where he sought"
1269,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,For daily knowledge till his mind was fraught:
1270,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Then, when his friends were present, for their use"
1271,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,He would the riches he had stored produce;
1272,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,He found his lamp burn clearer when each day
1273,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,He drew for all he purposed to display;
1274,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"For these occasions forth his knowledge sprung,"
1275,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,As mustard quickens on a bed of dung:
1276,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"All was prepared, and guests allow'd the praise"
1277,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,For what they saw he could so quickly raise.
1278,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Such this new friend; and when the year came round,"
1279,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The same impressive, reasoning sage was found:"
1280,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Then, too, was seen the pleasant mansion graced"
1281,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,With a fair damsel--his no vulgar taste;
1282,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The neat Rebecca--sly, observant, still,"
1283,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Watching his eye, and waiting on his will;"
1284,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Simple yet smart her dress, her manners meek,"
1285,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Her smiles spoke for her, she would seldom speak:"
1286,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"But watch'd each look, each meaning to detect,"
1287,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And (pleased with notice) felt for all neglect.
1288,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"With her lived Gwyn a sweet harmonious life,"
1289,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Who, forms excepted, was a charming wife:"
1290,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The wives indeed, so made by vulgar law,"
1291,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Affected scorn, and censured what they saw,"
1292,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And what they saw not, fancied; said 'twas sin,"
1293,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And took no notice of the wife of Gwyn:
1294,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"But he despised their rudeness, and would prove"
1295,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Theirs was compulsion and distrust, not love;"
1296,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""Fools as they were! could they conceive that rings"
1297,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And parsons' blessings were substantial things?"""
1298,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"They answer'd ""Yes;"" while he contemptuous spoke"
1299,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Of the low notions held by simple folk;
1300,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Yet, strange that anger in a man so wise"
1301,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Should from the notions of these fools arise;
1302,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Can they so vex us, whom we so despise?"
1303,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Brave as he was, our hero felt a dread"
1304,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Lest those who saw him kind should think him led;
1305,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"If to his bosom fear a visit paid,"
1306,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"It was, lest he should be supposed afraid:"
1307,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Hence sprang his orders; not that he desired
1308,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,The things when done:  obedience he required;
1309,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And thus, to prove his absolute command,"
1310,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Ruled every heart, and moved each subject hand;"
1311,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Assent he ask'd for every word and whim,"
1312,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,To prove that he alone was king of him.
1313,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The still Rebecca, who her station knew,"
1314,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,With ease resign'd the honours not her due:
1315,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Well pleased she saw that men her board would grace,"
1316,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And wish'd not there to see a female face;
1317,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"When by her lover she his spouse was styled,"
1318,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Polite she thought it, and demurely smiled;"
1319,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,But when he wanted wives and maidens round
1320,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"So to regard her, she grew grave and frown'd;"
1321,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And sometimes whisper'd--""Why should you respect"
1322,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"These people's notions, yet their forms reject?"""
1323,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Gwyn, though from marriage bond and fetter free,"
1324,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Still felt abridgment in his liberty;
1325,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Something of hesitation he betray'd,"
1326,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And in her presence thought of what he said.
1327,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Thus fair Rebecca, though she walk'd astray,"
1328,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"His creed rejecting, judged it right to pray,"
1329,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"To be at church, to sit with serious looks,"
1330,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,To read her Bible and her Sunday-books:
1331,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"She hated all those new and daring themes,"
1332,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And call'd his free conjectures ""devil's dreams:"""
1333,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"She honour'd still the priesthood in her fall,"
1334,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And claim'd respect and reverence for them all;
1335,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Call'd them ""of sin's destructive power the foes,"
1336,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And not such blockheads as he might suppose."""
1337,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Gwyn to his friends would smile, and sometimes say,"
1338,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""'Tis a kind fool; why vex her in her way?"""
1339,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Her way she took, and still had more in view,"
1340,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,For she contrived that he should take it too.
1341,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The daring freedom of his soul, 'twas plain,"
1342,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,In part was lost in a divided reign;
1343,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"A king and queen, who yet in prudence sway'd"
1344,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Their peaceful state, and were in turn obey'd."
1345,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Yet such our fate, that when we plan the best,"
1346,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Something arises to disturb our rest:
1347,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"For though in spirits high, in body strong,"
1348,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Gwyn something felt--he knew not what--was wrong,"
1349,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"He wish'd to know, for he believed the thing,"
1350,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"If unremoved, would other evil bring:"
1351,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""She must perceive, of late he could not eat,"
1352,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And when he walk'd he trembled on his feet:
1353,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"He had forebodings, and he seem'd as one"
1354,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Stopp'd on the road, or threaten'd by a dun;"
1355,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"He could not live, and yet, should he apply"
1356,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"To those physicians--he must sooner die."""
1357,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The mild Rebecca heard with some disdain,"
1358,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And some distress, her friend and lord complain:"
1359,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"His death she fear'd not, but had painful doubt"
1360,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,What his distemper'd nerves might bring about;
1361,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"With power like hers she dreaded an ally,"
1362,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And yet there was a person in her eye; -
1363,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"She thought, debated, fix'd--""Alas!"" she said,"
1364,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""A case like yours must be no more delay'd;"
1365,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,You hate these doctors; well! but were a friend
1366,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And doctor one, your fears would have an end:"
1367,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,My cousin Mollet--Scotland holds him now -
1368,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Is above all men skilful, all allow;"
1369,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Of late a Doctor, and within a while"
1370,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,He means to settle in this favoured isle:
1371,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Should he attend you, with his skill profound,"
1372,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"You must be safe, and shortly would be sound."""
1373,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"When men in health against Physicians rail,"
1374,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,They should consider that their nerves may fail;
1375,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Who calls a Lawyer rogue, may find, too late,"
1376,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,On one of these depends his whole estate;
1377,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Nay, when the world can nothing more produce,"
1378,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The Priest, th' insulted priest, may have his use;"
1379,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Ease, health, and comfort lift a man so high,"
1380,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,These powers are dwarfs that he can scarcely spy;
1381,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Pain, sickness, langour, keep a man so low,"
1382,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,That these neglected dwarfs to giants grow:
1383,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Happy is he who through the medium sees
1384,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Of clear good sense--but Gwyn was not of these.
1385,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"He heard and he rejoiced:  ""Ah! let him come,"
1386,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And till he fixes, make my house his home."""
1387,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Home came the Doctor--he was much admired;
1388,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,He told the patient what his case required;
1389,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"His hours for sleep, his time to eat and drink,"
1390,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"When he should ride, read, rest, compose, or think."
1391,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Thus join'd peculiar skill and art profound,"
1392,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,To make the fancy-sick no more than fancy-sound.
1393,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"With such attention, who could long be ill?"
1394,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Returning health proclaim'd the Doctor's skill.
1395,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Presents and praises from a grateful heart
1396,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Were freely offer'd on the patient's part;
1397,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"In high repute the Doctor seem'd to stand,"
1398,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,But still had got no footing in the land;
1399,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And, as he saw the seat was rich and fair,"
1400,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,He felt disposed to fix his station there:
1401,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,To gain his purpose he perform'd the part
1402,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Of a good actor, and prepared to start;"
1403,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Not like a traveller in a day serene,"
1404,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,When the sun shone and when the roads were clean;
1405,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Not like the pilgrim, when the morning gray,"
1406,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The ruddy eve succeeding, sends his way;"
1407,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,But in a season when the sharp east wind
1408,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Had all its influence on a nervous mind;
1409,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"When past the parlour's front it fiercely blew,"
1410,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And Gwyn sat pitying every bird that flew,"
1411,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"This strange physician said--""Adieu! Adieu!"
1412,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Farewell!--Heaven bless you!--if you should--but no,"
1413,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"You need not fear--farewell! 'tis time to go."""
1414,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The Doctor spoke; and as the patient heard,"
1415,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,His old disorders (dreadful train!) appear'd;
1416,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""He felt the tingling tremor, and the stress"
1417,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Upon his nerves that he could not express;
1418,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Should his good friend forsake him, he perhaps"
1419,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Might meet his death, and surely a relapse."""
1420,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"So, as the Doctor seem'd intent to part,"
1421,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"He cried in terror--""Oh! be where thou art:"
1422,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Come, thou art young, and unengaged; oh! come,"
1423,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Make me thy friend, give comfort to mine home;"
1424,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"I have now symptoms that require thine aid,"
1425,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Do, Doctor, stay:""--th' obliging Doctor stay'd."
1426,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Thus Gwyn was happy; he had now a friend,"
1427,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And a meek spouse on whom he could depend:
1428,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"But now possess'd of male and female guide,"
1429,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Divided power he thus must subdivide:
1430,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"In earlier days he rode, or sat at ease"
1431,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Reclined, and having but himself to please;"
1432,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Now if he would a fav'rite nag bestride,"
1433,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"He sought permission--""Doctor, may I ride?"""
1434,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,(Rebecca's eye her sovereign pleasure told) -
1435,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""I think you may, but guarded from the cold,"
1436,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Ride forty minutes.""--Free and happy soul,"
1437,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"He scorn'd submission, and a man's control;"
1438,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,But where such friends in every care unite
1439,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"All for his good, obedience is delight."
1440,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Now Gwyn a sultan bade affairs adieu,"
1441,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Led and assisted by the faithful two;
1442,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The favourite fair, Rebecca, near him sat,"
1443,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And whisper'd whom to love, assist, or hate;"
1444,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"While the chief vizier eased his lord of cares,"
1445,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And bore himself the burden of affairs:
1446,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"No dangers could from such alliance flow,"
1447,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,But from that law that changes all below.
1448,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"When wintry winds with leaves bestrew'd the ground,"
1449,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And men were coughing all the village round;
1450,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"When public papers of invasion told,"
1451,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Diseases, famines, perils new and old;"
1452,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,When philosophic writers fail'd to clear
1453,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The mind of gloom, and lighter works to cheer;"
1454,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Then came fresh terrors on our hero's mind -
1455,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Fears unforeseen, and feelings undefined."
1456,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""In outward ills,"" he cried, ""I rest assured"
1457,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Of my friend's aid; they will in time be cured;
1458,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"But can his art subdue, resist, control"
1459,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,These inward griefs and troubles of the soul?
1460,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Oh! my Rebecca! my disorder'd mind
1461,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"No help in study, none in thought can find;"
1462,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"What must I do, Rebecca?""  She proposed"
1463,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,The Parish-guide; but what could be disclosed
1464,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"To a proud priest?--""No! him have I defied,"
1465,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Insulted, slighted--shall he be my guide?"
1466,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"But one there is, and if report be just,"
1467,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"A wise good man, whom I may safely trust;"
1468,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Who goes from house to house, from ear to ear,"
1469,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"To make his truths, his Gospel-truths, appear;"
1470,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"True if indeed they be, 'tis time that I should hear:"
1471,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Send for that man; and if report be just,"
1472,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"I, like Cornelius, will the teacher trust;"
1473,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"But if deceiver, I the vile deceit"
1474,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Shall soon discover, and discharge the cheat."""
1475,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"To Doctor Mollet was the grief confess""d,"
1476,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,While Gwyn the freedom of his mind expressed;
1477,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Yet own'd it was to ills and errors prone,"
1478,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And he for guilt and frailty must atone.
1479,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""My books, perhaps,"" the wav'ring mortal cried,"
1480,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""Like men deceive; I would be satisfied; -"
1481,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And to my soul the pious man may bring
1482,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Comfort and light: --do let me try the thing."""
1483,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"The cousins met, what pass'd with Gwyn was told:"
1484,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""Alas!"" the Doctor said, ""how hard to hold"
1485,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"These easy minds, where all impressions made"
1486,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"At first sink deeply, and then quickly fade;"
1487,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"For while so strong these new-born fancies reign,"
1488,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"We must divert them, to oppose is vain:"
1489,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"You see him valiant now, he scorns to heed"
1490,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,The bigot's threat'nings or the zealot's creed;
1491,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Shook by a dream, he next for truth receives"
1492,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"What frenzy teaches, and what fear believes;"
1493,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And this will place him in the power of one
1494,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Whom we must seek, because we cannot shun."""
1495,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Wisp had been ostler at a busy inn,"
1496,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Where he beheld and grew in dread of sin;
1497,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Then to a Baptists' meeting found his way,"
1498,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Became a convert, and was taught to pray;"
1499,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Then preach'd; and, being earnest and sincere,"
1500,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Brought other sinners to religious fear:
1501,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Together grew his influence and his fame,"
1502,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Till our dejected hero heard his name:
1503,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"His little failings were a grain of pride,"
1504,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Raised by the numbers he presumed to guide;
1505,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"A love of presents, and of lofty praise"
1506,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,For his meek spirit and his humble ways;
1507,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"But though this spirit would on flattery feed,"
1508,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,No praise could blind him and no arts mislead:  -
1509,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,To him the Doctor made the wishes known
1510,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Of his good patron, but conceal'd his own;"
1511,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"He of all teachers had distrust and doubt,"
1512,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And was reserved in what he came about;
1513,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Though on a plain and simple message sent,"
1514,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,He had a secret and a bold intent:
1515,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Their minds at first were deeply veil'd; disguise
1516,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Form'd the slow speech, and oped the eager eyes;"
1517,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Till by degrees sufficient light was thrown
1518,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"On every view, and all the business shown."
1519,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Wisp, as a skilful guide who led the blind,"
1520,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Had powers to rule and awe the vapourish mind;
1521,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"But not the changeful will, the wavering fear to bind:"
1522,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And should his conscience give him leave to dwell
1523,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"With Gwyn, and every rival power expel"
1524,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"(A dubious point), yet he, with every care,"
1525,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Might soon the lot of the rejected share;
1526,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And other Wisps he found like him to reign,"
1527,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And then be thrown upon the world again:
1528,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"He thought it prudent then, and felt it just,"
1529,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,The present guides of his new friend to trust:
1530,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"True, he conceived, to touch the harder heart"
1531,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Of the cool Doctor, was beyond his art;"
1532,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"But mild Rebecca he could surely sway,"
1533,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,While Gwyn would follow where she led the way:
1534,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"So to do good, (and why a duty shun,"
1535,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Because rewarded for the good when done?)
1536,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"He with his friends would join in all they plann'd,"
1537,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Save when his faith or feelings should withstand;
1538,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"There he must rest sole judge of his affairs,"
1539,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,While they might rule exclusively in theirs.
1540,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"When Gwyn his message to the teacher sent,"
1541,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,He fear'd his friends would show their discontent;
1542,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And prudent seem'd it to th' attendant pair,"
1543,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Not all at once to show an aspect fair:
1544,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"On Wisp they seem'd to look with jealous eye,"
1545,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And fair Rebecca was demure and shy;
1546,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"But by degrees the teacher's worth they knew,"
1547,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And were so kind, they seem'd converted too."
1548,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Wisp took occasion to the nymph to say,"
1549,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""You must be married:  will you name the day?"""
1550,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"She smiled,--""'Tis well:  but should he not comply,"
1551,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Is it quite safe th' experiment to try?"" -"
1552,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""My child,"" the teacher said, ""who feels remorse,"
1553,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,(And feels not he?) must wish relief of course:
1554,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And can he find it, while he fears the crime! -"
1555,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"You must be married; will you name the time?"""
1556,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Glad was the patron as a man could be,"
1557,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Yet marvell'd too, to find his guides agree;"
1558,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"""But what the cause?"" he cried; ""'tis genuine love for me."""
1559,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Each found his part, and let one act describe"
1560,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,The powers and honours of th' accordant tribe:  -
1561,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"A man for favour to the mansion speeds,"
1562,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And cons his threefold task as he proceeds;
1563,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"To teacher Wisp he bows with humble air,"
1564,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And begs his interest for a barn's repair:
1565,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Then for the Doctor he inquires, who loves"
1566,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"To hear applause for what his skill improves,"
1567,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"And gives for praise, assent--and to the Fair"
1568,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,He brings of pullets a delicious pair;
1569,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Thus sees a peasant, with discernment nice,"
1570,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"A love of power, conceit, and avarice."
1571,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,Lo! now the change complete:  the convert Gwyn
1572,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Has sold his books, and has renounced his sin;"
1573,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Mollet his body orders, Wisp his soul,"
1574,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And o'er his purse the Lady takes control;
1575,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"No friends beside he needs, and none attend -"
1576,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"Soul, body, and estate, has each a friend;"
1577,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,And fair Rebecca leads a virtuous life -
1578,THE GENTLEMAN FARMER.,"She rules a mistress, and she reigns a wife."

1611,PROCRASTINATION.,-----------------------
1612,PROCRASTINATION.,
1613,PROCRASTINATION.,"Love will expire--the gay, the happy dream"
1614,PROCRASTINATION.,"Will turn to scorn, indiff'rence, or esteem:"
1615,PROCRASTINATION.,"Some favour'd pairs, in this exchange, are blest,"
1616,PROCRASTINATION.,Nor sigh for raptures in a state of rest;
1617,PROCRASTINATION.,"Others, ill match'd, with minds unpair'd, repent"
1618,PROCRASTINATION.,"At once the deed, and know no more content;"
1619,PROCRASTINATION.,"From joy to anguish they, in haste, decline,"
1620,PROCRASTINATION.,"And, with their fondness, their esteem resign;"
1621,PROCRASTINATION.,"More luckless still their fate, who are the prey"
1622,PROCRASTINATION.,Of long-protracted hope and dull delay:
1623,PROCRASTINATION.,"'Mid plans of bliss the heavy hours pass on,"
1624,PROCRASTINATION.,"Till love is withered, and till joy is gone."
1625,PROCRASTINATION.,"This gentle flame two youthful hearts possess'd,"
1626,PROCRASTINATION.,The sweet disturber of unenvied rest;
1627,PROCRASTINATION.,"The prudent Dinah was the maid beloved,"
1628,PROCRASTINATION.,And the kind Rupert was the swain approved:
1629,PROCRASTINATION.,"A wealthy Aunt her gentle niece sustain'd,"
1630,PROCRASTINATION.,"He, with a father, at his desk remain'd;"
1631,PROCRASTINATION.,"The youthful couple, to their vows sincere,"
1632,PROCRASTINATION.,"Thus loved expectant; year succeeding year,"
1633,PROCRASTINATION.,"With pleasant views and hopes, but not a prospect near."
1634,PROCRASTINATION.,"Rupert some comfort in his station saw,"
1635,PROCRASTINATION.,But the poor virgin lived in dread and awe;
1636,PROCRASTINATION.,"Upon her anxious looks the widow smiled,"
1637,PROCRASTINATION.,"And bade her wait, ""for she was yet a child."""
1638,PROCRASTINATION.,"She for her neighbour had a due respect,"
1639,PROCRASTINATION.,Nor would his son encourage or reject;
1640,PROCRASTINATION.,"And thus the pair, with expectation vain,"
1641,PROCRASTINATION.,Beheld the seasons change and change again;
1642,PROCRASTINATION.,"Meantime the nymph her tender tales perused,"
1643,PROCRASTINATION.,Where cruel aunts impatient girls refused:
1644,PROCRASTINATION.,"While hers, though teasing, boasted to be kind,"
1645,PROCRASTINATION.,"And she, resenting, to be all resign'd."
1646,PROCRASTINATION.,"The dame was sick, and when the youth applied"
1647,PROCRASTINATION.,"For her consent, she groan'd, and cough'd, and cried,"
1648,PROCRASTINATION.,"Talk'd of departing, and again her breath"
1649,PROCRASTINATION.,"Drew hard, and cough'd, and talk'd again of death:"
1650,PROCRASTINATION.,"""Here may you live, my Dinah! here the boy"
1651,PROCRASTINATION.,"And you together my estate enjoy:"""
1652,PROCRASTINATION.,"Thus to the lovers was her mind expressed,"
1653,PROCRASTINATION.,Till they forbore to urge the fond request.
1654,PROCRASTINATION.,"Servant, and nurse, and comforter, and friend,"
1655,PROCRASTINATION.,Dinah had still some duty to attend;
1656,PROCRASTINATION.,"But yet their walk, when Rupert's evening call"
1657,PROCRASTINATION.,"Obtain'd an hour, made sweet amends for all;"
1658,PROCRASTINATION.,"So long they now each other's thoughts had known,"
1659,PROCRASTINATION.,That nothing seem'd exclusively their own:
1660,PROCRASTINATION.,"But with the common wish, the mutual fear,"
1661,PROCRASTINATION.,They now had travelled to their thirtieth year.
1662,PROCRASTINATION.,At length a prospect open'd--but alas!
1663,PROCRASTINATION.,"Long time must yet, before the union, pass."
1664,PROCRASTINATION.,"Rupert was call'd, in other clime, t'increase"
1665,PROCRASTINATION.,"Another's wealth, and toil for future peace."
1666,PROCRASTINATION.,Loth were the lovers; but the aunt declared
1667,PROCRASTINATION.,"'Twas fortune's call, and they must be prepar'd:"
1668,PROCRASTINATION.,"""You now are young, and for this brief delay,"
1669,PROCRASTINATION.,"And Dinah's care, what I bequeath will pay;"
1670,PROCRASTINATION.,"All will be yours; nay, love, suppress that sigh;"
1671,PROCRASTINATION.,"The kind must suffer, and the best must die:"""
1672,PROCRASTINATION.,"Then came the cough, and strong the signs it gave"
1673,PROCRASTINATION.,Of holding long contention with the grave.
1674,PROCRASTINATION.,"The lovers parted with a gloomy view,"
1675,PROCRASTINATION.,"And little comfort, but that both were true;"
1676,PROCRASTINATION.,"He for uncertain duties doom'd to steer,"
1677,PROCRASTINATION.,While hers remain'd too certain and severe.
1678,PROCRASTINATION.,"Letters arrived, and Rupert fairly told"
1679,PROCRASTINATION.,"""His cares were many, and his hopes were cold:"
1680,PROCRASTINATION.,"The view more clouded, that was never fair,"
1681,PROCRASTINATION.,"And love alone preserved him from despair;"""
1682,PROCRASTINATION.,"In other letters brighter hopes he drew,"
1683,PROCRASTINATION.,"""His friends were kind, and he believed them true."""
1684,PROCRASTINATION.,"When the sage widow Dinah's grief descried,"
1685,PROCRASTINATION.,She wonder'd much why one so happy sigh'd:
1686,PROCRASTINATION.,Then bade her see how her poor aunt sustain'd
1687,PROCRASTINATION.,"The ills of life, nor murmur'd nor complain'd."
1688,PROCRASTINATION.,"To vary pleasures, from the lady's chest"
1689,PROCRASTINATION.,Were drawn the pearly string and tabby vest;
1690,PROCRASTINATION.,"Beads, jewels, laces, all their value shown,"
1691,PROCRASTINATION.,"With the kind notice--""They will be your own."""
1692,PROCRASTINATION.,"This hope, these comforts, cherish'd day by day,"
1693,PROCRASTINATION.,To Dinah's bosom made a gradual way;
1694,PROCRASTINATION.,"Till love of treasure had as large a part,"
1695,PROCRASTINATION.,"As love of Rupert, in the virgin's heart."
1696,PROCRASTINATION.,"Whether it be that tender passions fail,"
1697,PROCRASTINATION.,"From their own nature, while the strong prevail;"
1698,PROCRASTINATION.,"Or whether av'rice, like the poison-tree,"
1699,PROCRASTINATION.,"Kills all beside it, and alone will be;"
1700,PROCRASTINATION.,"Whatever cause prevail'd, the pleasure grew"
1701,PROCRASTINATION.,"In Dinah's soul,--she loved the hoards to view;"
1702,PROCRASTINATION.,"With lively joy those comforts she survey'd,"
1703,PROCRASTINATION.,And love grew languid in the careful maid.
1704,PROCRASTINATION.,"Now the grave niece partook the widow's cares,"
1705,PROCRASTINATION.,"Look'd to the great, and ruled the small affairs;"
1706,PROCRASTINATION.,"Saw clean'd the plate, arranged the china-show,"
1707,PROCRASTINATION.,And felt her passion for a shilling grow:
1708,PROCRASTINATION.,"Th' indulgent aunt increased the maid's delight,"
1709,PROCRASTINATION.,By placing tokens of her wealth in sight;
1710,PROCRASTINATION.,"She loved the value of her bonds to tell,"
1711,PROCRASTINATION.,"And spake of stocks, and how they rose and fell."
1712,PROCRASTINATION.,"This passion grew, and gain'd at length such sway,"
1713,PROCRASTINATION.,That other passions shrank to make it way;
1714,PROCRASTINATION.,"Romantic notions now the heart forsook,"
1715,PROCRASTINATION.,"She read but seldom, and she changed her book;"
1716,PROCRASTINATION.,"And for the verses she was wont to send,"
1717,PROCRASTINATION.,"Short was her prose, and she was Rupert's friend."
1718,PROCRASTINATION.,"Seldom she wrote, and then the widow's cough,"
1719,PROCRASTINATION.,"And constant call, excused her breaking off;"
1720,PROCRASTINATION.,"Who now oppressed, no longer took the air,"
1721,PROCRASTINATION.,But sat and dozed upon an easy chair.
1722,PROCRASTINATION.,"The cautious doctor saw the case was clear,"
1723,PROCRASTINATION.,But judged it best to have companions near;
1724,PROCRASTINATION.,"They came, they reason'd, they prescribed,--at last,"
1725,PROCRASTINATION.,"Like honest men, they said their hopes were past;"
1726,PROCRASTINATION.,Then came a priest--'tis comfort to reflect
1727,PROCRASTINATION.,"When all is over, there was no neglect:"
1728,PROCRASTINATION.,"And all was over.--By her husband's bones,"
1729,PROCRASTINATION.,"The widow rests beneath the sculptured stones,"
1730,PROCRASTINATION.,"That yet record their fondness and their fame,"
1731,PROCRASTINATION.,While all they left the virgin's care became;
1732,PROCRASTINATION.,"Stock, bonds, and buildings; it disturb'd her rest,"
1733,PROCRASTINATION.,To think what load of troubles she possessed:
1734,PROCRASTINATION.,"Yet, if a trouble, she resolved to take"
1735,PROCRASTINATION.,Th' important duty for the donor's sake;
1736,PROCRASTINATION.,"She too was heiress to the widow's taste,"
1737,PROCRASTINATION.,"Her love of hoarding, and her dread of waste."
1738,PROCRASTINATION.,"Sometimes the past would on her mind intrude,"
1739,PROCRASTINATION.,And then a conflict full of care ensued;
1740,PROCRASTINATION.,"The thoughts of Rupert on her mind would press,"
1741,PROCRASTINATION.,"His worth she knew, but doubted his success:"
1742,PROCRASTINATION.,Of old she saw him heedless; what the boy
1743,PROCRASTINATION.,"Forebore to save, the man would not enjoy;"
1744,PROCRASTINATION.,"Oft had he lost the chance that care would seize,"
1745,PROCRASTINATION.,"Willing to live, but more to live at ease:"
1746,PROCRASTINATION.,"Yet could she not a broken vow defend,"
1747,PROCRASTINATION.,"And Heav'n, perhaps, might yet enrich her friend."
1748,PROCRASTINATION.,"Month after month was pass'd, and all were spent"
1749,PROCRASTINATION.,"In quiet comfort, and in rich content;"
1750,PROCRASTINATION.,"Miseries there were, and woes the world around,"
1751,PROCRASTINATION.,But these had not her pleasant dwelling found;
1752,PROCRASTINATION.,"She knew that mothers grieved, and widows wept,"
1753,PROCRASTINATION.,"And she was sorry, said her prayers, and slept:"
1754,PROCRASTINATION.,"Thus passed the seasons, and to Dinah's board"
1755,PROCRASTINATION.,Gave what the seasons to the rich afford;
1756,PROCRASTINATION.,"For she indulged, nor was her heart so small,"
1757,PROCRASTINATION.,That one strong passion should engross it all.
1758,PROCRASTINATION.,"A love of splendour now with av'rice strove,"
1759,PROCRASTINATION.,And oft appeared to be the stronger love:
1760,PROCRASTINATION.,"A secret pleasure fill'd the Widow's breast,"
1761,PROCRASTINATION.,When she reflected on the hoards possess'd;
1762,PROCRASTINATION.,"But livelier joy inspired th' ambitious Maid,"
1763,PROCRASTINATION.,When she the purchase of those hoards display'd:
1764,PROCRASTINATION.,In small but splendid room she loved to see
1765,PROCRASTINATION.,That all was placed in view and harmony.
1766,PROCRASTINATION.,"There, as with eager glance she look'd around,"
1767,PROCRASTINATION.,She much delight in every object found.
1768,PROCRASTINATION.,"While books devout were near her--to destroy,"
1769,PROCRASTINATION.,"Should it arise, an overflow of joy."
1770,PROCRASTINATION.,Within that fair apartment guests might see
1771,PROCRASTINATION.,The comforts cull'd for wealth by vanity:
1772,PROCRASTINATION.,"Around the room an Indian paper blazed,"
1773,PROCRASTINATION.,With lively tint and figures boldly raised;
1774,PROCRASTINATION.,"Silky and soft upon the floor below,"
1775,PROCRASTINATION.,Th' elastic carpet rose with crimson glow;
1776,PROCRASTINATION.,"All things around implied both cost and care,"
1777,PROCRASTINATION.,What met the eye was elegant or rare:
1778,PROCRASTINATION.,"Some curious trifles round the room were laid,"
1779,PROCRASTINATION.,By hope presented to the wealthy Maid;
1780,PROCRASTINATION.,"Within a costly case of varnish'd wood,"
1781,PROCRASTINATION.,"In level rows, her polish'd volumes stood;"
1782,PROCRASTINATION.,"Shown as a favour to a chosen few,"
1783,PROCRASTINATION.,To prove what beauty for a book could do:
1784,PROCRASTINATION.,A silver urn with curious work was fraught;
1785,PROCRASTINATION.,A silver lamp from Grecian pattern wrought:
1786,PROCRASTINATION.,"Above her head, all gorgeous to behold,"
1787,PROCRASTINATION.,A time-piece stood on feet of burnish'd gold;
1788,PROCRASTINATION.,"A stag's-head crest adorn'd the pictured case,"
1789,PROCRASTINATION.,Through the pure crystal shone the enamel'd face;
1790,PROCRASTINATION.,"And while on brilliants moved the hands of steel,"
1791,PROCRASTINATION.,"It click'd from pray'r to pray'r, from meal to meal."
1792,PROCRASTINATION.,"Here as the lady sat, a friendly pair"
1793,PROCRASTINATION.,"Stept in t'admire the view, and took their chair:"
1794,PROCRASTINATION.,They then related how the young and gay
1795,PROCRASTINATION.,Were thoughtless wandering in the broad highway:
1796,PROCRASTINATION.,"How tender damsels sail'd in tilted boats,"
1797,PROCRASTINATION.,And laugh'd with wicked men in scarlet coats;
1798,PROCRASTINATION.,"And how we live in such degen'rate times,"
1799,PROCRASTINATION.,That men conceal their wants and show their crimes;
1800,PROCRASTINATION.,"While vicious deeds are screen'd by fashion's name,"
1801,PROCRASTINATION.,And what was once our pride is now our shame.
1802,PROCRASTINATION.,"Dinah was musing, as her friends discoursed,"
1803,PROCRASTINATION.,When these last words a sudden entrance forced
1804,PROCRASTINATION.,"Upon her mind, and what was once her pride"
1805,PROCRASTINATION.,"And now her shame, some painful views supplied;"
1806,PROCRASTINATION.,"Thoughts of the past within her bosom press'd,"
1807,PROCRASTINATION.,"And there a change was felt, and was confess'd:"
1808,PROCRASTINATION.,"While thus the Virgin strove with secret pain,"
1809,PROCRASTINATION.,Her mind was wandering o'er the troubled main;
1810,PROCRASTINATION.,"Still she was silent, nothing seem'd to see,"
1811,PROCRASTINATION.,But sat and sigh'd in pensive reverie.
1812,PROCRASTINATION.,"The friends prepared new subjects to begin,"
1813,PROCRASTINATION.,"When tall Susannah, maiden starch, stalk'd in;"
1814,PROCRASTINATION.,"Not in her ancient mode, sedate and slow,"
1815,PROCRASTINATION.,"As when she came, the mind she knew, to know;"
1816,PROCRASTINATION.,"Nor as, when list'ning half an hour before,"
1817,PROCRASTINATION.,She twice or thrice tapp'd gently at the door;
1818,PROCRASTINATION.,"But all decorum cast in wrath aside,"
1819,PROCRASTINATION.,"""I think the devil's in the man!"" she cried;"
1820,PROCRASTINATION.,"""A huge tall sailor, with his tawny cheek"
1821,PROCRASTINATION.,"And pitted face, will with my lady speak;"
1822,PROCRASTINATION.,"He grinn'd an ugly smile, and said he knew,"
1823,PROCRASTINATION.,"Please you, my lady, 't would be joy to you:"
1824,PROCRASTINATION.,"What must I answer?""--Trembling and distress'd"
1825,PROCRASTINATION.,Sank the pale Dinah by her fears oppress'd;
1826,PROCRASTINATION.,"When thus alarm'd and brooking no delay,"
1827,PROCRASTINATION.,Swift to her room the stranger made his way.
1828,PROCRASTINATION.,"""Revive, my love!"" said he, ""I've done thee harm;"
1829,PROCRASTINATION.,"Give me thy pardon,"" and he look'd alarm:"
1830,PROCRASTINATION.,Meantime the prudent Dinah had contrived
1831,PROCRASTINATION.,"Her soul to question, and she then revived."
1832,PROCRASTINATION.,"""See! my good friend,"" and then she raised her head,"
1833,PROCRASTINATION.,"""The bloom of life, the strength of youth is fled;"
1834,PROCRASTINATION.,Living we die; to us the world is dead;
1835,PROCRASTINATION.,"We parted bless'd with health, and I am now"
1836,PROCRASTINATION.,Age-struck and feeble--so I find art thou;
1837,PROCRASTINATION.,"Thine eye is sunken, furrow'd is thy face,"
1838,PROCRASTINATION.,And downward look'st thou--so we run our race;
1839,PROCRASTINATION.,"And happier they whose race is nearly run,"
1840,PROCRASTINATION.,"Their troubles over, and their duties done."""
1841,PROCRASTINATION.,"""True, lady, true--we are not girl and boy,"
1842,PROCRASTINATION.,"But time has left us something to enjoy."""
1843,PROCRASTINATION.,"""What! hast thou learn'd my fortune?--yes, I live"
1844,PROCRASTINATION.,To feel how poor the comforts wealth can give:
1845,PROCRASTINATION.,Thou too perhaps art wealthy; but our fate
1846,PROCRASTINATION.,"Still mocks our wishes, wealth is come too late."""
1847,PROCRASTINATION.,"""To me nor late nor early; I am come"
1848,PROCRASTINATION.,Poor as I left thee to my native home:
1849,PROCRASTINATION.,"Nor yet,"" said Rupert, ""will I grieve; 'tis mine"
1850,PROCRASTINATION.,"To share thy comforts, and the glory thine:"
1851,PROCRASTINATION.,For thou wilt gladly take that generous part
1852,PROCRASTINATION.,That both exalts and gratifies the heart;
1853,PROCRASTINATION.,"While mine rejoices""--""Heavens!"" return'd the maid,"
1854,PROCRASTINATION.,"""This talk to one so wither'd and decay'd?"
1855,PROCRASTINATION.,No! all my care is now to fit my mind
1856,PROCRASTINATION.,"For other spousal, and to die resigned:"
1857,PROCRASTINATION.,"As friend and neighbour, I shall hope to see"
1858,PROCRASTINATION.,"These noble views, this pious love in thee;"
1859,PROCRASTINATION.,"That we together may the change await,"
1860,PROCRASTINATION.,Guides and spectators in each other's fate;
1861,PROCRASTINATION.,"When fellow pilgrims, we shall daily crave"
1862,PROCRASTINATION.,"The mutual prayer that arms us for the grave."""
1863,PROCRASTINATION.,"Half angry, half in doubt, the lover gazed"
1864,PROCRASTINATION.,"On the meek maiden, by her speech amazed;"
1865,PROCRASTINATION.,"""Dinah,"" said he, ""dost thou respect thy vows?"
1866,PROCRASTINATION.,What spousal mean'st thou?--thou art Rupert's spouse;
1867,PROCRASTINATION.,"That chance is mine to take, and thine to give:"
1868,PROCRASTINATION.,"But, trifling this, if we together live:"
1869,PROCRASTINATION.,"Can I believe, that, after all the past,"
1870,PROCRASTINATION.,"Our vows, our loves, thou wilt be false at last?"
1871,PROCRASTINATION.,Something thou hast--I know not what--in view;
1872,PROCRASTINATION.,"I find thee pious--let me find thee true."""
1873,PROCRASTINATION.,"""Ah! cruel this; but do, my friend, depart;"
1874,PROCRASTINATION.,"And to its feelings leave my wounded heart."""
1875,PROCRASTINATION.,"""Nay, speak at once; and Dinah, let me know,"
1876,PROCRASTINATION.,"Mean'st thou to take me, now I'm wreck'd, in tow?"
1877,PROCRASTINATION.,Be fair; nor longer keep me in the dark;
1878,PROCRASTINATION.,Am I forsaken for a trimmer spark?
1879,PROCRASTINATION.,Heaven's spouse thou art not; nor can I believe
1880,PROCRASTINATION.,That God accepts her who will man deceive:
1881,PROCRASTINATION.,"True I am shatter'd, I have service seen,"
1882,PROCRASTINATION.,"And service done, and have in trouble been;"
1883,PROCRASTINATION.,"My cheek (it shames me not) has lost its red,"
1884,PROCRASTINATION.,And the brown buff is o'er my features spread:
1885,PROCRASTINATION.,Perchance my speech is rude; for I among
1886,PROCRASTINATION.,"Th' untamed have been, in temper and in tongue;"
1887,PROCRASTINATION.,"Have been trepann'd, have lived in toil and care,"
1888,PROCRASTINATION.,And wrought for wealth I was not doom'd to share;
1889,PROCRASTINATION.,"It touch'd me deeply, for I felt a pride"
1890,PROCRASTINATION.,In gaining riches for my destin'd bride:
1891,PROCRASTINATION.,"Speak then my fate; for these my sorrows past,"
1892,PROCRASTINATION.,"Time lost, youth fled, hope wearied, and at last"
1893,PROCRASTINATION.,"This doubt of thee--a childish thing to tell,"
1894,PROCRASTINATION.,But certain truth--my very throat they swell:
1895,PROCRASTINATION.,"They stop the breath, and but for shame could I"
1896,PROCRASTINATION.,"Give way to weakness, and with passion cry;"
1897,PROCRASTINATION.,"These are unmanly struggles, but I feel"
1898,PROCRASTINATION.,"This hour must end them, and perhaps will heal."""
1899,PROCRASTINATION.,"Here Dinah sigh'd, as if afraid to speak -"
1900,PROCRASTINATION.,"And then repeated--""They were frail and weak:"
1901,PROCRASTINATION.,"His soul she lov'd, and hoped he had the grace"
1902,PROCRASTINATION.,"To fix his thoughts upon a better place."""
1903,PROCRASTINATION.,"She ceased;--with steady glance, as if to see"
1904,PROCRASTINATION.,"The very root of this hypocrisy, -"
1905,PROCRASTINATION.,He her small fingers moulded in his hard
1906,PROCRASTINATION.,"And bronzed broad hand; then told her his regard,"
1907,PROCRASTINATION.,"His best respect were gone, but love had still"
1908,PROCRASTINATION.,"Hold in his heart, and govern'd yet the will -"
1909,PROCRASTINATION.,"Or he would curse her: --saying this, he threw"
1910,PROCRASTINATION.,"The hand in scorn away, and bade adieu"
1911,PROCRASTINATION.,"To every lingering hope, with every care in view."
1912,PROCRASTINATION.,"Proud and indignant, suffering, sick, and poor,"
1913,PROCRASTINATION.,He grieved unseen:  and spoke of love no more -
1914,PROCRASTINATION.,"Till all he felt in indignation died,"
1915,PROCRASTINATION.,As hers had sunk in avarice and pride.
1916,PROCRASTINATION.,"In health declining, as in mind distressed,"
1917,PROCRASTINATION.,"To some in power his troubles he confess'd,"
1918,PROCRASTINATION.,And shares a parish-gift; at prayers he sees
1919,PROCRASTINATION.,The pious Dinah dropp'd upon her knees;
1920,PROCRASTINATION.,Thence as she walks the street with stately air
1921,PROCRASTINATION.,"As chance directs, oft meet the parted pair;"
1922,PROCRASTINATION.,"When he, with thickset coat of badgeman's blue,"
1923,PROCRASTINATION.,Moves near her shaded silk of changeful hue;
1924,PROCRASTINATION.,"When his thin locks of gray approach her braid,"
1925,PROCRASTINATION.,A costly purchase made in Beauty's aid;
1926,PROCRASTINATION.,"When his frank air, and his unstudied pace,"
1927,PROCRASTINATION.,"Are seen with her soft manner, air, and grace;"
1928,PROCRASTINATION.,And his plain artless look with her sharp meaning face;
1929,PROCRASTINATION.,"It might some wonder in a stranger move,"
1930,PROCRASTINATION.,How these together could have talk'd of love.
1931,PROCRASTINATION.,"Behold them now!--see there a tradesman stands,"
1932,PROCRASTINATION.,And humbly hearkens to some fresh commands;
1933,PROCRASTINATION.,"He moves to speak, she interrupts him--""Stay,"""
1934,PROCRASTINATION.,"Her air expresses,--""Hark to what I say!"""
1935,PROCRASTINATION.,"Ten paces off, poor Rupert on a seat"
1936,PROCRASTINATION.,"Has taken refuge from the noon-day heat,"
1937,PROCRASTINATION.,"His eyes on her intent, as if to find"
1938,PROCRASTINATION.,What were the movements of that subtle mind:
1939,PROCRASTINATION.,How still!--how earnest is he!--it appears
1940,PROCRASTINATION.,His thoughts are wand'ring through his earlier years;
1941,PROCRASTINATION.,"Through years of fruitless labour, to the day"

1948,PROCRASTINATION.,But Dinah moves--she had observed before
1949,PROCRASTINATION.,The pensive Rupert at an humble door:

1951,PROCRASTINATION.,Some feeling touch of ancient tenderness;
1952,PROCRASTINATION.,"Religion, duty urged the maid to speak,"
1953,PROCRASTINATION.,In terms of kindness to a man so weak:
1954,PROCRASTINATION.,"But pride forbade, and to return would prove"
1955,PROCRASTINATION.,She felt the shame of his neglected love;
1956,PROCRASTINATION.,"Nor wrapp'd in silence could she pass, afraid"

1990,THE PATRON.,"A Borough-Bailiff, who to law was train'd,"
1991,THE PATRON.,"A wife and sons in decent state maintain'd,"
1992,THE PATRON.,He had his way in life's rough ocean steer'd
1993,THE PATRON.,And many a rock and coast of danger clear'd;
1994,THE PATRON.,"He saw where others fail'd, and care had he,"
1995,THE PATRON.,Others in him should not such feelings see:
1996,THE PATRON.,"His sons in various busy states were placed,"
1997,THE PATRON.,"And all began the sweets of gain to taste,"
1998,THE PATRON.,"Save John, the younger, who, of sprightly parts,"
1999,THE PATRON.,Felt not a love for money-making arts:
2000,THE PATRON.,"In childhood feeble, he, for country air,"
2001,THE PATRON.,Had long resided with a rustic pair;
2002,THE PATRON.,"All round whose room were doleful ballads, songs,"
2003,THE PATRON.,Of lovers' sufferings and of ladies' wrongs;
2004,THE PATRON.,"Of peevish ghosts who came at dark midnight,"
2005,THE PATRON.,"For breach of promise, guilty men to fright;"
2006,THE PATRON.,"Love, marriage, murder, were the themes, with these,"
2007,THE PATRON.,"All that on idle, ardent spirits seize;"
2008,THE PATRON.,"Robbers at land and pirates on the main,"
2009,THE PATRON.,"Enchanters foil'd, spells broken, giants slain;"
2010,THE PATRON.,"Legends of love, with tales of halls and bowers,"
2011,THE PATRON.,"Choice of rare songs, and garlands of choice flowers,"
2012,THE PATRON.,And all the hungry mind without a choice devours.
2013,THE PATRON.,"From village-children kept apart by pride,"
2014,THE PATRON.,"With such enjoyments, and without a guide,"
2015,THE PATRON.,"Inspired by feelings all such works infused,"
2016,THE PATRON.,"John snatch'd a pen, and wrote as he perused:"
2017,THE PATRON.,With the like fancy he could make his knight
2018,THE PATRON.,"Slay half a host, and put the rest to flight;"
2019,THE PATRON.,With the like knowledge he could make him ride
2020,THE PATRON.,From isle to isle at Parthenissa's side;
2021,THE PATRON.,"And with a heart yet free, no busy brain"
2022,THE PATRON.,"Form'd wilder notions of delight and pain,"
2023,THE PATRON.,"The raptures smiles create, the anguish of disdain."
2024,THE PATRON.,Such were the fruits of John's poetic toil -
2025,THE PATRON.,"Weeds, but still proofs of vigour in the soil:"
2026,THE PATRON.,"He nothing purposed but with vast delight,"
2027,THE PATRON.,"Let Fancy loose, and wonder'd at her flight:"
2028,THE PATRON.,"His notions of poetic worth were high,"
2029,THE PATRON.,And of his own still-hoarded poetry; -
2030,THE PATRON.,"These to his father's house he bore with pride,"
2031,THE PATRON.,"A miser's treasure, in his room to hide;"
2032,THE PATRON.,"Till spurr'd by glory, to a reading friend,"
2033,THE PATRON.,He kindly show'd the sonnets he had penn'd:
2034,THE PATRON.,"With erring judgment, though with heart sincere,"
2035,THE PATRON.,"That friend exclaim'd, ""These beauties must appear.'"
2036,THE PATRON.,"In magazines they claim'd their share of fame,"
2037,THE PATRON.,Though undistinguish'd by their author's name;
2038,THE PATRON.,And with delight the young enthusiast found
2039,THE PATRON.,The muse of Marcus with applauses crown'd.
2040,THE PATRON.,"This heard the father, and with some alarm;"
2041,THE PATRON.,"""The boy,"" said he, ""will neither trade nor farm,"
2042,THE PATRON.,"He for both law and physic is unfit,"
2043,THE PATRON.,"Wit he may have, but cannot live on wit:"
2044,THE PATRON.,"Let him his talents then to learning give,"
2045,THE PATRON.,"Where verse is honour'd, and where poets live."""
2046,THE PATRON.,"John kept his terms at college unreproved,"
2047,THE PATRON.,"Took his degree, and left the life he loved;"
2048,THE PATRON.,"Not yet ordain'd, his leisure he employ'd"
2049,THE PATRON.,In the light labours he so much enjoy'd;
2050,THE PATRON.,His favourite notions and his daring views
2051,THE PATRON.,"Were cherish'd still, and he adored the Muse."
2052,THE PATRON.,"""A little time, and he should burst to light,"
2053,THE PATRON.,And admiration of the world excite;
2054,THE PATRON.,"And every friend, now cool and apt to blame"
2055,THE PATRON.,"His fond pursuit, would wonder at his fame."""
2056,THE PATRON.,"When led by fancy, and from view retired,"
2057,THE PATRON.,He call'd before him all his heart desired;
2058,THE PATRON.,"""Fame shall be mine, then wealth shall I possess,"
2059,THE PATRON.,And beauty next an ardent lover bless;
2060,THE PATRON.,"For me the maid shall leave her nobler state,"
2061,THE PATRON.,"Happy to raise and share her poet's fate."""
2062,THE PATRON.,"He saw each day his father's frugal board,"
2063,THE PATRON.,With simple fare by cautious prudence stored:
2064,THE PATRON.,"Where each indulgence was foreweigh'd with care,"
2065,THE PATRON.,And the grand maxims were to save and spare:
2066,THE PATRON.,"Yet in his walks, his closet, and his bed,"
2067,THE PATRON.,All frugal cares and prudent counsels fled;
2068,THE PATRON.,"And bounteous Fancy, for his glowing mind,"
2069,THE PATRON.,"Wrought various scenes, and all of glorious kind:"
2070,THE PATRON.,"Slaves of the ring and lamp! what need of you,"
2071,THE PATRON.,When Fancy's self such magic deeds can do?
2072,THE PATRON.,"Though rapt in visions of no vulgar kind,"
2073,THE PATRON.,To common subjects stoop'd our poet's mind;
2074,THE PATRON.,"And oft when wearied with more ardent flight,"
2075,THE PATRON.,He felt a spur satiric song to write;
2076,THE PATRON.,"A rival burgess his bold Muse attack'd,"
2077,THE PATRON.,And whipp'd severely for a well known fact;
2078,THE PATRON.,"For while he seem'd to all demure and shy,"
2079,THE PATRON.,Our poet gazed at what was passing by;
2080,THE PATRON.,"And e'en his father smiled when playful wit,"
2081,THE PATRON.,"From his young bard, some haughty object hit."
2082,THE PATRON.,"From ancient times, the borough where they dwelt"
2083,THE PATRON.,Had mighty contests at elections felt;
2084,THE PATRON.,"Sir Godfrey Ball, 'tis true, had held in pay"
2085,THE PATRON.,Electors many for the trying day;
2086,THE PATRON.,But in such golden chains to bind them all
2087,THE PATRON.,Required too much for e'en Sir Godfrey Ball.
2088,THE PATRON.,"A member died, and to supply his place"
2089,THE PATRON.,Two heroes enter'd for th' important race;
2090,THE PATRON.,"Sir Godfrey's friend and Earl Fitzdonnel's son,"
2091,THE PATRON.,"Lord Frederick Darner, both prepared to run;"
2092,THE PATRON.,And partial numbers saw with vast delight
2093,THE PATRON.,Their good young lord oppose the proud old knight.
2094,THE PATRON.,"Our poet's father, at a first request,"
2095,THE PATRON.,Gave the young lord his vote and interest;
2096,THE PATRON.,"And what he could our poet, for he stung"
2097,THE PATRON.,"The foe by verse satiric, said and sung."
2098,THE PATRON.,"Lord Frederick heard of all this youthful zeal,"
2099,THE PATRON.,And felt as lords upon a canvass feel;
2100,THE PATRON.,"He read the satire, and he saw the use"
2101,THE PATRON.,"That such cool insult, and such keen abuse,"
2102,THE PATRON.,Might on the wavering minds of voting men produce;
2103,THE PATRON.,"Then too his praises were in contrast seen,"
2104,THE PATRON.,"""A lord as noble as the knight was mean."""
2105,THE PATRON.,"""I much rejoice,"" he cried, ""such worth to find;"
2106,THE PATRON.,To this the world must be no longer blind:
2107,THE PATRON.,"His glory will descend from sire to son,"
2108,THE PATRON.,"The Burns of English race, the happier Chatterton."""
2109,THE PATRON.,"Our poet's mind now hurried and elate,"
2110,THE PATRON.,Alarm'd the anxious parent for his fate;
2111,THE PATRON.,"Who saw with sorrow, should their friend succeed,"
2112,THE PATRON.,That much discretion would the poet need.
2113,THE PATRON.,"Their friends succeeded, and repaid the zeal"
2114,THE PATRON.,"The Poet felt, and made opposers feel,"
2115,THE PATRON.,By praise (from lords how soothing and how sweet!)
2116,THE PATRON.,An invitation to his noble seat.
2117,THE PATRON.,"The father ponder'd, doubtful if the brain"
2118,THE PATRON.,Of his proud boy such honour could sustain;
2119,THE PATRON.,"Pleased with the favours offer'd to a son,"
2120,THE PATRON.,But seeing dangers few so ardent shun.
2121,THE PATRON.,"Thus when they parted, to the youthful breast"
2122,THE PATRON.,The father's fears were by his love impress'd:
2123,THE PATRON.,"""There will you find, my son, the courteous ease"
2124,THE PATRON.,That must subdue the soul it means to please;
2125,THE PATRON.,That soft attention which e'en beauty pays
2126,THE PATRON.,"To wake our passions, or provoke our praise;"
2127,THE PATRON.,"There all the eye beholds will give delight,"
2128,THE PATRON.,Where every sense is flatter'd like the sight;
2129,THE PATRON.,This is your peril; can you from such scene
2130,THE PATRON.,"Of splendour part, and feel your mind serene,"
2131,THE PATRON.,And in the father's humble state resume
2132,THE PATRON.,"The frugal diet and the narrow room?"""
2133,THE PATRON.,"To this the youth with cheerful heart replied,"
2134,THE PATRON.,"Pleased with the trial, but as yet untried;"
2135,THE PATRON.,"And while professing patience, should he fail,"
2136,THE PATRON.,He suffered hope o'er reason to prevail.
2137,THE PATRON.,"Impatient, by the morning mail conveyed,"
2138,THE PATRON.,The happy guest his promised visit paid;
2139,THE PATRON.,"And now arriving at the Hall, he tried"
2140,THE PATRON.,"For air composed, serene and satisfied;"
2141,THE PATRON.,"As he had practised in his room alone,"
2142,THE PATRON.,And there acquired a free and easy tone:
2143,THE PATRON.,"There he had said, ""Whatever the degree"
2144,THE PATRON.,"A man obtains, what more than man is he?"""
2145,THE PATRON.,"And when arrived--""This room is but a room;"
2146,THE PATRON.,Can aught we see the steady soul o'ercome?
2147,THE PATRON.,"Let me in all a manly firmness show,"
2148,THE PATRON.,"Upheld by talents, and their value know."""
2149,THE PATRON.,This reason urged; but it surpassed his skill
2150,THE PATRON.,To be in act as manly as in will:
2151,THE PATRON.,When he his Lordship and the Lady saw
2152,THE PATRON.,"Brave as he was, he felt oppress'd with awe;"
2153,THE PATRON.,"And spite of verse, that so much praise had won,"
2154,THE PATRON.,The poet found he was the Bailiff's son.
2155,THE PATRON.,"But dinner came, and the succeeding hours"
2156,THE PATRON.,"Fix'd his weak nerves, and raised his failing powers;"
2157,THE PATRON.,"Praised and assured, he ventured once or twice"
2158,THE PATRON.,"On some remark, and bravely broke the ice;"
2159,THE PATRON.,"So that, at night, reflecting on his words,"
2160,THE PATRON.,"He found, in time, he might converse with lords."
2161,THE PATRON.,Now was the Sister of his Patron seen -
2162,THE PATRON.,"A lovely creature, with majestic mien;"
2163,THE PATRON.,"Who, softly smiling, while she looked so fair,"
2164,THE PATRON.,Praised the young poet with such friendly air;
2165,THE PATRON.,"Such winning frankness in her looks express'd,"
2166,THE PATRON.,And such attention to her brother's guest;
2167,THE PATRON.,"That so much beauty, join'd with speech so kind,"
2168,THE PATRON.,Raised strong emotions in the poet's mind;
2169,THE PATRON.,"Till reason fail'd his bosom to defend,"
2170,THE PATRON.,From the sweet power of this enchanting friend. -
2171,THE PATRON.,Rash boy! what hope thy frantic mind invades?
2172,THE PATRON.,"What love confuses, and what pride persuades?"
2173,THE PATRON.,Awake to truth! shouldst thou deluded feed
2174,THE PATRON.,"On hopes so groundless, thou art mad indeed."
2175,THE PATRON.,"What say'st thou, wise one?--""that all powerful Love"
2176,THE PATRON.,Can fortune's strong impediments remove;
2177,THE PATRON.,"Nor is it strange that worth should wed to worth,"
2178,THE PATRON.,"The pride of genius with the pride of birth."""
2179,THE PATRON.,"While thou art dreaming thus, the Beauty spies"
2180,THE PATRON.,"Love in thy tremor, passion in thine eyes;"
2181,THE PATRON.,"And with th' amusement pleased, of conquest vain,"
2182,THE PATRON.,"She seeks her pleasure, careless of thy pain;"
2183,THE PATRON.,"She gives thee praise to humble and confound,"
2184,THE PATRON.,"Smiles to ensnare, and flatters thee to wound."
2185,THE PATRON.,Why has she said that in the lowest state
2186,THE PATRON.,The noble mind ensures a noble fate?
2187,THE PATRON.,And why thy daring mind to glory call? -
2188,THE PATRON.,"That thou may'st dare and suffer, soar and fall."
2189,THE PATRON.,"Beauties are tyrants, and if they can reign,"
2190,THE PATRON.,They have no feeling for their subjects' pain:
2191,THE PATRON.,"Their victim's anguish gives their charms applause,"
2192,THE PATRON.,And their chief glory is the woe they cause:
2193,THE PATRON.,"Something of this was felt, in spite of love,"
2194,THE PATRON.,"Which hope, in spite of reason, would remove."
2195,THE PATRON.,"Thus lived our youth, with conversation, books,"
2196,THE PATRON.,And Lady Emma's soul-subduing looks:
2197,THE PATRON.,"Lost in delight, astonish'd at his lot,"
2198,THE PATRON.,"All prudence banish'd, all advice forgot -"
2199,THE PATRON.,"Hopes, fears, and every thought, were fix'd upon the spot."
2200,THE PATRON.,"'Twas autumn yet, and many a day must frown"
2201,THE PATRON.,"On Brandon-Hall, ere went my Lord to town;"
2202,THE PATRON.,"Meantime the father, who had heard his boy"
2203,THE PATRON.,"Lived in a round of luxury and joy,"
2204,THE PATRON.,And justly thinking that the youth was one
2205,THE PATRON.,"Who, meeting danger, was unskill'd to shun;"
2206,THE PATRON.,"Knowing his temper, virtue, spirit, zeal,"
2207,THE PATRON.,"How prone to hope and trust, believe and feel;"
2208,THE PATRON.,"These on the parent's soul their weight impress'd,"
2209,THE PATRON.,And thus he wrote the counsels of his breast:  -
2210,THE PATRON.,"""John, thou'rt a genius; thou hast some pretence,"
2211,THE PATRON.,"I think, to wit,--but hast thou sterling sense?"
2212,THE PATRON.,"That which, like gold, may through the world go forth,"
2213,THE PATRON.,And always pass for what 'tis truly worth:
2214,THE PATRON.,"Whereas this genius, like a bill must take"
2215,THE PATRON.,Only the value our opinions make.
2216,THE PATRON.,"""Men famed for wit, of dangerous talents vain."
2217,THE PATRON.,Treat those of common parts with proud disdain;
2218,THE PATRON.,"The powers that wisdom would, improving, hide,"
2219,THE PATRON.,They blaze abroad with inconsid'rate pride;
2220,THE PATRON.,"While yet but mere probationers for fame,"
2221,THE PATRON.,They seize the honour they should then disclaim;
2222,THE PATRON.,"Honour so hurried to the light must fade,"
2223,THE PATRON.,The lasting laurels flourish in the shade.
2224,THE PATRON.,"""Genius is jealous:  I have heard of some"
2225,THE PATRON.,"Who, if unnoticed, grew perversely dumb;"
2226,THE PATRON.,"Nay, different talents would their envy raise;"
2227,THE PATRON.,Poets have sicken'd at a dancer's praise;
2228,THE PATRON.,"And one, the happiest writer of his time,"
2229,THE PATRON.,Grew pale at hearing Reynolds was sublime;
2230,THE PATRON.,That Rutland's Duchess wore a heavenly smile -
2231,THE PATRON.,"'And I,' said he, 'neglected all the while!'"
2232,THE PATRON.,"""A waspish tribe are these, on gilded wings,"
2233,THE PATRON.,"Humming their lays, and brandishing their stings:"
2234,THE PATRON.,"And thus they move their friends and foes among,"
2235,THE PATRON.,Prepared for soothing or satiric song.
2236,THE PATRON.,"""Hear me, my Boy; thou hast a virtuous mind -"
2237,THE PATRON.,But be thy virtues of the sober kind;
2238,THE PATRON.,"Be not a Quixote, ever up in arms"
2239,THE PATRON.,To give the guilty and the great alarms:
2240,THE PATRON.,"If never heeded, thy attack is vain;"
2241,THE PATRON.,"And if they heed thee, they'll attack again;"
2242,THE PATRON.,"Then too in striking at that heedless rate,"
2243,THE PATRON.,Thou in an instant may'st decide thy fate.
2244,THE PATRON.,"""Leave admonition--let the vicar give"
2245,THE PATRON.,Rules how the nobles of his flock should live;
2246,THE PATRON.,"Nor take that simple fancy to thy brain,"
2247,THE PATRON.,That thou canst cure the wicked and the vain.
2248,THE PATRON.,"""Our Pope, they say, once entertain'd the whim,"
2249,THE PATRON.,Who fear'd not God should be afraid of him;
2250,THE PATRON.,"But grant they fear'd him, was it further said,"
2251,THE PATRON.,That he reform'd the hearts he made afraid?
2252,THE PATRON.,"Did Chartres mend?  Ward, Waters, and a score"
2253,THE PATRON.,"Of flagrant felons, with his floggings sore?"
2254,THE PATRON.,"Was Cibber silenced?  No; with vigour blest,"
2255,THE PATRON.,"And brazen front, half earnest, half in jest,"
2256,THE PATRON.,"He dared the bard to battle, and was seen"
2257,THE PATRON.,In all his glory match'd with Pope and spleen;
2258,THE PATRON.,"Himself he stripp'd, the harder blow to hit,"
2259,THE PATRON.,Then boldly match'd his ribaldry with wit;
2260,THE PATRON.,"The poet's conquest truth and time proclaim,"
2261,THE PATRON.,But yet the battle hurt his peace and fame.
2262,THE PATRON.,"""Strive not too much for favour; seem at ease."
2263,THE PATRON.,"And rather please thyself, than bent to please:"
2264,THE PATRON.,"Upon thy lord with decent care attend,"
2265,THE PATRON.,But not too near; thou canst not be a friend;
2266,THE PATRON.,"And favourite be not, 'tis a dangerous post -"
2267,THE PATRON.,"Is gain'd by labour, and by fortune lost:"
2268,THE PATRON.,"Talents like thine may make a man approved,"
2269,THE PATRON.,But other talents trusted and beloved.
2270,THE PATRON.,"Look round, my son, and thou wilt early see"
2271,THE PATRON.,The kind of man thou art not form'd to be.
2272,THE PATRON.,"""The real favourites of the great are they"
2273,THE PATRON.,"Who to their views and wants attention pay,"
2274,THE PATRON.,"And pay it ever; who, with all their skill,"
2275,THE PATRON.,"Dive to the heart, and learn the secret will;"
2276,THE PATRON.,"If that be vicious, soon can they provide"
2277,THE PATRON.,"The favourite ill, and o'er the soul preside,"
2278,THE PATRON.,"For vice is weakness, and the artful know"
2279,THE PATRON.,Their power increases as the passions grow;
2280,THE PATRON.,"If indolent the pupil, hard their task;"
2281,THE PATRON.,Such minds will ever for amusement ask;
2282,THE PATRON.,And great the labour! for a man to choose
2283,THE PATRON.,Objects for one whom nothing can amuse;
2284,THE PATRON.,"For ere those objects can the soul delight,"
2285,THE PATRON.,They must to joy the soul herself excite;
2286,THE PATRON.,"Therefore it is, this patient, watchful kind"
2287,THE PATRON.,With gentle friction stir the drowsy mind:
2288,THE PATRON.,"Fix'd on their end, with caution they proceed,"
2289,THE PATRON.,"And sometimes give, and sometimes take the lead;"
2290,THE PATRON.,"Will now a hint convey, and then retire,"
2291,THE PATRON.,And let the spark awake the lingering fire;
2292,THE PATRON.,"Or seek new joys, and livelier pleasures bring"
2293,THE PATRON.,To give the jaded sense a quick'ning spring.
2294,THE PATRON.,"""These arts, indeed, my son must not pursue;"
2295,THE PATRON.,Nor must he quarrel with the tribe that do:
2296,THE PATRON.,"It is not safe another's crimes to know,"
2297,THE PATRON.,Nor is it wise our proper worth to show:  -
2298,THE PATRON.,"'My lord,' you say, 'engaged me for that worth;' -"
2299,THE PATRON.,"True, and preserve it ready to come forth:"
2300,THE PATRON.,"If questioned, fairly answer,--and that done,"
2301,THE PATRON.,"Shrink back, be silent, and thy father's son;"
2302,THE PATRON.,"For they who doubt thy talents scorn thy boast,"
2303,THE PATRON.,But they who grant them will dislike thee most:
2304,THE PATRON.,"Observe the prudent; they in silence sit,"
2305,THE PATRON.,"Display no learning, and affect no wit;"
2306,THE PATRON.,"They hazard nothing, nothing they assume,"
2307,THE PATRON.,But know the useful art of acting dumb.
2308,THE PATRON.,"Yet to their eyes each varying look appears,"
2309,THE PATRON.,And every word finds entrance at their ears.
2310,THE PATRON.,"""Thou art Religion's advocate--take heed,"
2311,THE PATRON.,"Hurt not the cause, thy pleasure 'tis to plead;"
2312,THE PATRON.,"With wine before thee, and with wits beside,"
2313,THE PATRON.,Do not in strength of reasoning powers confide;
2314,THE PATRON.,"What seems to thee convincing, certain, plain,"
2315,THE PATRON.,"They will deny, and dare thee to maintain;"
2316,THE PATRON.,"And thus will triumph o'er thy eager youth,"
2317,THE PATRON.,While thou wilt grieve for so disgracing truth.
2318,THE PATRON.,"With pain I've seen, these wrangling wits among,"
2319,THE PATRON.,"Faith's weak defenders, passionate and young;"
2320,THE PATRON.,"Weak thou art not, yet not enough on guard,"
2321,THE PATRON.,Where wit and humour keep their watch and ward:
2322,THE PATRON.,"Men gay and noisy will o'erwhelm thy sense,"
2323,THE PATRON.,Then loudly laugh at truth's and thy expense;
2324,THE PATRON.,While the kind ladies will do all they can
2325,THE PATRON.,"To check their mirth, and cry, 'The good young man!'"
2326,THE PATRON.,"""Prudence, my Boy, forbids thee to commend"
2327,THE PATRON.,The cause or party of thy noble friend;
2328,THE PATRON.,"What are his praises worth, who must be known,"
2329,THE PATRON.,To take a Patron's maxims for his own?
2330,THE PATRON.,"When ladies sing, or in thy presence play,"
2331,THE PATRON.,"Do not, dear John, in rapture melt away;"
2332,THE PATRON.,"'Tis not thy part, there will be list'ners round,"
2333,THE PATRON.,To cry Divine! and dote upon the sound;
2334,THE PATRON.,"Remember, too, that though the poor have ears,"
2335,THE PATRON.,They take not in the music of the spheres;
2336,THE PATRON.,"They must not feel the warble and the thrill,"
2337,THE PATRON.,Or be dissolved in ecstasy at will;
2338,THE PATRON.,"Beside, 'tis freedom in a youth like thee"
2339,THE PATRON.,"To drop his awe, and deal in ecstasy!"
2340,THE PATRON.,"""In silent ease, at least in silence, dine,"
2341,THE PATRON.,Nor one opinion start of food or wine:
2342,THE PATRON.,"Thou knowest that all the science thou can boast,"
2343,THE PATRON.,Is of thy father's simple boil'd or roast;
2344,THE PATRON.,"Nor always these; he sometimes saved his cash,"
2345,THE PATRON.,By interlinear days of frugal hash:
2346,THE PATRON.,Wine hadst thou seldom; wilt thou be so vain
2347,THE PATRON.,As to decide on claret or champagne?
2348,THE PATRON.,"Dost thou from me derive this taste sublime,"
2349,THE PATRON.,Who order port the dozen at a time?
2350,THE PATRON.,When (every glass held precious in our eyes)
2351,THE PATRON.,We judged the value by the bottle's size:
2352,THE PATRON.,"Then never merit for thy praise assume,"
2353,THE PATRON.,Its worth well knows each servant in the room.
2354,THE PATRON.,"""Hard, Boy, thy task, to steer thy way among"
2355,THE PATRON.,"That servile, supple, shrewd, insidious throng;"
2356,THE PATRON.,"Who look upon thee as of doubtful race,"
2357,THE PATRON.,"An interloper, one who wants a place:"
2358,THE PATRON.,"Freedom with these, let thy free soul condemn,"
2359,THE PATRON.,Nor with thy heart's concerns associate them.
2360,THE PATRON.,"""Of all be cautious--but be most afraid"
2361,THE PATRON.,Of the pale charms that grace My Lady's Maid;
2362,THE PATRON.,"Of those sweet dimples, of that fraudful eye,"
2363,THE PATRON.,The frequent glance designed for thee to spy;
2364,THE PATRON.,"The soft bewitching look, the fond bewailing sigh:"
2365,THE PATRON.,Let others frown and envy; she the while
2366,THE PATRON.,(Insidious syren!) will demurely smile;
2367,THE PATRON.,"And for her gentle purpose, every day"
2368,THE PATRON.,"Inquire thy wants, and meet thee in thy way;"
2369,THE PATRON.,"She has her blandishments, and, though so weak,"
2370,THE PATRON.,"Her person pleases, and her actions speak:"
2371,THE PATRON.,At first her folly may her aim defeat;
2372,THE PATRON.,"But kindness shown, at length will kindness meet:"
2373,THE PATRON.,"Have some offended? them will she disdain,"
2374,THE PATRON.,"And, for thy sake, contempt and pity feign;"
2375,THE PATRON.,"She hates the vulgar, she admires to look"
2376,THE PATRON.,"On woods and groves, and dotes upon a book;"
2377,THE PATRON.,"Let her once see thee on her features dwell,"
2378,THE PATRON.,"And hear one sigh, then liberty farewell."
2379,THE PATRON.,"""But, John, remember we cannot maintain"
2380,THE PATRON.,"A poor, proud girl, extravagant and vain."
2381,THE PATRON.,"""Doubt much of friendship:  shouldst thou find a friend"
2382,THE PATRON.,"Pleased to advise thee, anxious to commend;"
2383,THE PATRON.,"Should he the praises he has heard report,"
2384,THE PATRON.,And confidence (in thee confiding) court;
2385,THE PATRON.,"Much of neglected Patrons should he say,"
2386,THE PATRON.,And then exclaim--'How long must merit stay!'
2387,THE PATRON.,"Then show how high thy modest hopes may stretch,"
2388,THE PATRON.,And point to stations far beyond thy reach;
2389,THE PATRON.,"Let such designer, by thy conduct, see"
2390,THE PATRON.,(Civil and cool) he makes no dupe of thee;
2391,THE PATRON.,"And he will quit thee, as a man too wise"
2392,THE PATRON.,"For him to ruin first, and then despise."
2393,THE PATRON.,"""Such are thy dangers: --yet, if thou canst steer"
2394,THE PATRON.,"Past all the perils, all the quicksands clear,"
2395,THE PATRON.,"Then may'st thou profit; but if storms prevail,"
2396,THE PATRON.,"If foes beset thee, if thy spirits fail, -"
2397,THE PATRON.,"No more of winds or waters be the sport,"
2398,THE PATRON.,"But in thy father's mansion, find a port."""
2399,THE PATRON.,"Our poet read.--""It is in truth,"" said he,"
2400,THE PATRON.,"""Correct in part, but what is this to me?"
2401,THE PATRON.,I love a foolish Abigail! in base
2402,THE PATRON.,And sordid office! fear not such disgrace:
2403,THE PATRON.,"Am I so blind?""  ""Or thou wouldst surely see"
2404,THE PATRON.,"That lady's fall, if she should stoop to thee!"""
2405,THE PATRON.,"""The cases differ.""  ""True! for what surprise"
2406,THE PATRON.,Could from thy marriage with the maid arise?
2407,THE PATRON.,"But through the island would the shame be spread,"
2408,THE PATRON.,"Should the fair mistress deign with thee to wed."""
2409,THE PATRON.,"John saw not this; and many a week had pass'd,"
2410,THE PATRON.,While the vain beauty held her victim fast;
2411,THE PATRON.,"The Noble Friend still condescension show'd,"
2412,THE PATRON.,"And, as before, with praises overflowed;"
2413,THE PATRON.,But his grave Lady took a silent view
2414,THE PATRON.,"Of all that pass'd, and smiling, pitied too."
2415,THE PATRON.,"Cold grew the foggy morn, the day was brief,"
2416,THE PATRON.,Loose on the cherry hung the crimson leaf;
2417,THE PATRON.,The dew dwelt ever on the herb; the woods
2418,THE PATRON.,"Roar'd with strong blasts, with mighty showers the floods:"
2419,THE PATRON.,"All green was vanish'd, save of pine and yew,"
2420,THE PATRON.,That still displayed their melancholy hue;
2421,THE PATRON.,"Save the green holly with its berries red,"
2422,THE PATRON.,And the green moss that o'er the gravel spread.
2423,THE PATRON.,To public views my Lord must soon attend;
2424,THE PATRON.,And soon the ladies--would they leave their friend?
2425,THE PATRON.,The time was fix'd--approach'd--was near--was come;
2426,THE PATRON.,The trying time that fill'd his soul with gloom:
2427,THE PATRON.,"Thoughtful our poet in the morning rose,"
2428,THE PATRON.,"And cried, ""One hour my fortune will disclose;"
2429,THE PATRON.,Terrific hour! from thee have I to date
2430,THE PATRON.,"Life's loftier views, or my degraded state;"
2431,THE PATRON.,For now to be what I have been before
2432,THE PATRON.,"Is so to fall, that I can rise no more."""
2433,THE PATRON.,The morning meal was past; and all around
2434,THE PATRON.,The mansion rang with each discordant sound;
2435,THE PATRON.,"Haste was in every foot, and every look"
2436,THE PATRON.,The trav'ller's joy for London-journey spoke:
2437,THE PATRON.,Not so our youth; whose feelings at the noise
2438,THE PATRON.,"Of preparation, had no touch of joys:"
2439,THE PATRON.,"He pensive stood, and saw each carriage drawn,"
2440,THE PATRON.,"With lackeys mounted, ready on the lawn:"
2441,THE PATRON.,The ladies came; and John in terror threw
2442,THE PATRON.,"One painful glance, and then his eyes withdrew;"
2443,THE PATRON.,"Not with such speed, but he in other eyes"
2444,THE PATRON.,"With anguish read--""I pity, but despise -"
2445,THE PATRON.,"Unhappy boy!--presumptuous scribbler!--you,"
2446,THE PATRON.,"To dream such dreams!--be sober, and adieu!"""
2447,THE PATRON.,"Then came the Noble Friend--""And will my Lord"
2448,THE PATRON.,Vouchsafe no comfort; drop no soothing word?
2449,THE PATRON.,"Yes, he must speak;"" he speaks, ""My good young friend,"
2450,THE PATRON.,You know my views; upon my care depend;
2451,THE PATRON.,"My hearty thanks to your good father pay,"
2452,THE PATRON.,"And be a student.--Harry, drive away."""
2453,THE PATRON.,Stillness reign'd all around; of late so full
2454,THE PATRON.,"The busy scene, deserted now and dull:"
2455,THE PATRON.,Stern is his nature who forbears to feel
2456,THE PATRON.,Gloom o'er his spirits on such trials steal;
2457,THE PATRON.,Most keenly felt our poet as he went
2458,THE PATRON.,From room to room without a fix'd intent;
2459,THE PATRON.,"""And here,"" he thought, ""I was caress'd; admired"
2460,THE PATRON.,"Were here my songs; she smiled, and I aspired."
2461,THE PATRON.,"The change how grievous!"" As he mused, a dame"
2462,THE PATRON.,Busy and peevish to her duties came;
2463,THE PATRON.,"Aside the tables and the chairs she drew,"
2464,THE PATRON.,And sang and mutter'd in the poet's view:  -
2465,THE PATRON.,"""This was her fortune; here they leave the poor;"
2466,THE PATRON.,"Enjoy themselves, and think of us no more;"
2467,THE PATRON.,"I had a promise""--here his pride and shame"
2468,THE PATRON.,Urged him to fly from this familiar dame;
2469,THE PATRON.,"He gave one farewell look, and by a coach"
2470,THE PATRON.,Reach'd his own mansion at the night's approach.
2471,THE PATRON.,"His father met him with an anxious air,"
2472,THE PATRON.,"Heard his sad tale, and check'd what seem'd despair:"
2473,THE PATRON.,"Hope was in him corrected, but alive;"
2474,THE PATRON.,My lord would something for a friend contrive;
2475,THE PATRON.,His word was pledged:  our hero's feverish mind
2476,THE PATRON.,"Admitted this, and half his grief resigned:"
2477,THE PATRON.,"But, when three months had fled, and every day"
2478,THE PATRON.,"Drew from the sickening hopes their strength away,"
2479,THE PATRON.,"The youth became abstracted, pensive, dull;"
2480,THE PATRON.,"He utter'd nothing, though his heart was full;"
2481,THE PATRON.,"Teased by inquiring words and anxious looks,"
2482,THE PATRON.,And all forgetful of his Muse and books;
2483,THE PATRON.,"Awake he mourn'd, but in his sleep perceived"
2484,THE PATRON.,A lovely vision that his pain relieved:  -
2485,THE PATRON.,"His soul, transported, hail'd the happy seat,"
2486,THE PATRON.,Where once his pleasure was so pure and sweet;
2487,THE PATRON.,Where joys departed came in blissful view
2488,THE PATRON.,"Till reason waked, and not a joy he knew."
2489,THE PATRON.,"Questions now vex'd his spirit, most from those"
2490,THE PATRON.,"Who are call'd friends, because they are not foes:"
2491,THE PATRON.,"""John?"" they would say; he, starting, turn'd around,"
2492,THE PATRON.,"""John!"" there was something shocking in the sound:"
2493,THE PATRON.,"Ill brook'd he then the pert familiar phrase,"
2494,THE PATRON.,The untaught freedom and th' inquiring gaze;
2495,THE PATRON.,"Much was his temper touch'd, his spleen provoked,"
2496,THE PATRON.,"When ask'd how ladies talk'd, or walk'd, or look'd?"
2497,THE PATRON.,"""What said my Lord of politics! how spent"
2498,THE PATRON.,"He there his time? and was he glad he went?"""
2499,THE PATRON.,"At length a letter came, both cool and brief,"
2500,THE PATRON.,But still it gave the burden'd heart relief:
2501,THE PATRON.,"Though not inspired by lofty hopes, the youth"
2502,THE PATRON.,Placed much reliance on Lord Frederick's truth;
2503,THE PATRON.,"Summon'd to town, he thought the visit one"
2504,THE PATRON.,Where something fair and friendly would be done;
2505,THE PATRON.,"Although he judged not, as before his fall,"
2506,THE PATRON.,When all was love and promise at the hall.
2507,THE PATRON.,"Arrived in town, he early sought to know"
2508,THE PATRON.,The fate such dubious friendship would bestow;
2509,THE PATRON.,"At a tall building trembling he appear'd,"
2510,THE PATRON.,And his low rap was indistinctly heard;
2511,THE PATRON.,"A well-known servant came--""Awhile,"" said he,"
2512,THE PATRON.,"""Be pleased to wait; my Lord has company."""
2513,THE PATRON.,"Alone our hero sat; the news in hand,"
2514,THE PATRON.,"Which though he read, he could not understand:"
2515,THE PATRON.,Cold was the day; in days so cold as these
2516,THE PATRON.,"There needs a fire, where minds and bodies freeze."
2517,THE PATRON.,"The vast and echoing room, the polish'd grate,"
2518,THE PATRON.,"The crimson chairs, the sideboard with its plate;"
2519,THE PATRON.,"The splendid sofa, which, though made for rest,"
2520,THE PATRON.,He then had thought it freedom to have press'd;
2521,THE PATRON.,"The shining tables, curiously inlaid,"
2522,THE PATRON.,Were all in comfortless proud style display'd;
2523,THE PATRON.,"And to the troubled feelings terror gave,"
2524,THE PATRON.,That made the once-dear friend the sick'ning slave.
2525,THE PATRON.,"""Was he forgotten?""  Thrice upon his ear"
2526,THE PATRON.,"Struck the loud clock, yet no relief was near:"
2527,THE PATRON.,"Each rattling carriage, and each thundering stroke"
2528,THE PATRON.,"On the loud door, the dream of fancy broke;"
2529,THE PATRON.,"Oft as a servant chanced the way to come,"
2530,THE PATRON.,"""Brings he a message?"" no! he passed the room.'"
2531,THE PATRON.,"At length 'tis certain; ""Sir, you will attend"
2532,THE PATRON.,"At twelve on Thursday!""  Thus the day had end."
2533,THE PATRON.,"Vex'd by these tedious hours of needless pain,"
2534,THE PATRON.,John left the noble mansion with disdain;
2535,THE PATRON.,"For there was something in that still, cold place,"
2536,THE PATRON.,That seemed to threaten and portend disgrace.
2537,THE PATRON.,Punctual again the modest rap declared
2538,THE PATRON.,The youth attended; then was all prepared:
2539,THE PATRON.,"For the same servant, by his lord's command,"
2540,THE PATRON.,A paper offer'd to his trembling hand:
2541,THE PATRON.,"""No more!"" he cried:  ""disdains he to afford"
2542,THE PATRON.,"One kind expression, one consoling word?"""
2543,THE PATRON.,With troubled spirit he began to read
2544,THE PATRON.,"That ""In the Church my lord could not succeed;"""
2545,THE PATRON.,"Who had ""to peers of either kind applied,"
2546,THE PATRON.,And was with dignity and grace denied;
2547,THE PATRON.,"While his own livings were by men possess'd,"
2548,THE PATRON.,Not likely in their chancels yet to rest;
2549,THE PATRON.,"And therefore, all things weigh'd (as he my lord,"
2550,THE PATRON.,"Had done maturely, and he pledged his word),"
2551,THE PATRON.,Wisdom it seem'd for John to turn his view
2552,THE PATRON.,"To busier scenes, and bid the Church adieu!"""
2553,THE PATRON.,Here grieved the youth:  he felt his father's pride
2554,THE PATRON.,Must with his own be shocked and mortified;
2555,THE PATRON.,"But, when he found his future comforts placed"
2556,THE PATRON.,"Where he, alas! conceived himself disgraced -"
2557,THE PATRON.,"In some appointment on the London quays,"
2558,THE PATRON.,He bade farewell to honour and to ease;
2559,THE PATRON.,"His spirit fell, and from that hour assured"
2560,THE PATRON.,"How vain his dreams, he suffer'd and was cured."
2561,THE PATRON.,"Our Poet hurried on, with wish to fly"
2562,THE PATRON.,"From all mankind, to be conceal'd, and die."
2563,THE PATRON.,"Alas! what hopes, what high romantic views"
2564,THE PATRON.,"Did that one visit to the soul infuse,"
2565,THE PATRON.,"Which cherished with such love, 'twas worse than death to lose."
2566,THE PATRON.,"Still he would strive, though painful was the strife,"
2567,THE PATRON.,To walk in this appointed road of life;
2568,THE PATRON.,"On these low duties duteous he would wait,"
2569,THE PATRON.,And patient bear the anguish of his fate.
2570,THE PATRON.,"Thanks to the Patron, but of coldest kind,"
2571,THE PATRON.,Express'd the sadness of the Poet's mind;
2572,THE PATRON.,"Whose heavy hours were pass'd with busy men,"
2573,THE PATRON.,In the dull practice of th' official pen;
2574,THE PATRON.,Who to superiors must in time impart;
2575,THE PATRON.,(The custom this) his progress in their art:
2576,THE PATRON.,"But so had grief on his perception wrought,"
2577,THE PATRON.,That all unheeded were the duties taught;
2578,THE PATRON.,"No answers gave he when his trial came,"
2579,THE PATRON.,"Silent he stood, but suffering without shame;"
2580,THE PATRON.,And they observed that words severe or kind
2581,THE PATRON.,Made no impression on his wounded mind:
2582,THE PATRON.,"For all perceived from whence his failure rose,"
2583,THE PATRON.,"Some grief, whose cause he deign'd not to disclose."
2584,THE PATRON.,"A soul averse from scenes and works so new,"
2585,THE PATRON.,Fear ever shrinking from the vulgar crew;
2586,THE PATRON.,Distaste for each mechanic law and rule.
2587,THE PATRON.,Thoughts of past honour and a patron cool;
2588,THE PATRON.,"A grieving parent, and a feeling mind,"
2589,THE PATRON.,"Timid and ardent, tender and refined:"
2590,THE PATRON.,"These all with mighty force the youth assail'd,"
2591,THE PATRON.,"Till his soul fainted, and his reason fail'd:"
2592,THE PATRON.,"When this was known, and some debate arose,"
2593,THE PATRON.,"How they who saw it should the fact disclose,"
2594,THE PATRON.,"He found their purpose, and in terror fled"
2595,THE PATRON.,"From unseen kindness, with mistaken dread."
2596,THE PATRON.,Meantime the parent was distress'd to find
2597,THE PATRON.,His son no longer for a priest design'd;
2598,THE PATRON.,But still he gain'd some comfort by the news
2599,THE PATRON.,"Of John's promotion, though with humbler views;"
2600,THE PATRON.,For he conceived that in no distant time
2601,THE PATRON.,The boy would learn to scramble and to climb;
2602,THE PATRON.,"He little thought his son, his hope and pride,"
2603,THE PATRON.,"His favour'd boy, was now a home denied:"
2604,THE PATRON.,Yes! while the parent was intent to trace
2605,THE PATRON.,"How men in office climb from place to place,"
2606,THE PATRON.,"By day, by night, o'er moor and heath, and hill,"
2607,THE PATRON.,"Roved the sad youth, with ever-changing will,"
2608,THE PATRON.,"Of every aid bereft, exposed to every ill."
2609,THE PATRON.,"Thus as he sat, absorb'd in all the care"
2610,THE PATRON.,"And all the hope that anxious fathers share,"
2611,THE PATRON.,"A friend abruptly to his presence brought,"
2612,THE PATRON.,"With trembling hand, the subject of his thought;"
2613,THE PATRON.,Whom he had found afflicted and subdued
2614,THE PATRON.,"By hunger, sorrow, cold, and solitude."
2615,THE PATRON.,"Silent he enter'd the forgotten room,"
2616,THE PATRON.,As ghostly forms may be conceived to come;
2617,THE PATRON.,"With sorrow-shrunken face and hair upright,"
2618,THE PATRON.,"He look'd dismayed, neglect, despair, affright;"
2619,THE PATRON.,"But dead to comfort, and on misery thrown,"
2620,THE PATRON.,"His parent's loss he felt not, nor his own."
2621,THE PATRON.,"The good man, struck with horror, cried aloud,"
2622,THE PATRON.,And drew around him an astonish'd crowd;
2623,THE PATRON.,"The sons and servants to the father ran,"
2624,THE PATRON.,To share the feelings of the griev'd old man.
2625,THE PATRON.,"""Our brother, speak!"" they all exclam'd ""explain"
2626,THE PATRON.,"Thy grief, thy suffering:""--but they ask'd in vain:"
2627,THE PATRON.,"The friend told all he knew; and all was known,"
2628,THE PATRON.,Save the sad causes whence the ills had grown;
2629,THE PATRON.,"But, if obscure the cause, they all agreed"
2630,THE PATRON.,From rest and kindness must the cure proceed:
2631,THE PATRON.,"And he was cured; for quiet, love, and care,"
2632,THE PATRON.,"Strove with the gloom, and broke on the despair;"
2633,THE PATRON.,"Yet slow their progress, and as vapours move"
2634,THE PATRON.,Dense and reluctant from the wintry grove;
2635,THE PATRON.,"All is confusion, till the morning light"
2636,THE PATRON.,Gives the dim scene obscurely to the sight;
2637,THE PATRON.,"More and yet more defined the trunks appear,"
2638,THE PATRON.,Till the wild prospect stands distinct and clear; -
2639,THE PATRON.,So the dark mind of our young poet grew
2640,THE PATRON.,Clear and sedate; the dreadful mist withdrew;
2641,THE PATRON.,"And he resembled that bleak wintry scene,"
2642,THE PATRON.,"Sad, though unclouded; dismal, though serene."
2643,THE PATRON.,"At times he utter'd, ""What a dream was mine!"
2644,THE PATRON.,And what a prospect! glorious and divine!
2645,THE PATRON.,"Oh! in that room, and on that night to see"
2646,THE PATRON.,"Those looks, that sweetness beaming all on me;"
2647,THE PATRON.,"That syren-flattery--and to send me then,"
2648,THE PATRON.,"Hope-raised and soften'd, to those heartless men;"
2649,THE PATRON.,"That dark-brow'd stern Director, pleased to show"
2650,THE PATRON.,Knowledge of subjects I disdain'd to know;
2651,THE PATRON.,Cold and controlling--but 'tis gone--'tis past;
2652,THE PATRON.,"I had my trial, and have peace at last."""
2653,THE PATRON.,Now grew the youth resigned:  he bade adieu
2654,THE PATRON.,"To all that hope, to all that fancy drew;"
2655,THE PATRON.,"His frame was languid, and the hectic heat"
2656,THE PATRON.,"Flush'd on his pallid face, and countless beat"
2657,THE PATRON.,"The quick'ning pulse, and faint the limbs that bore"
2658,THE PATRON.,The slender form that soon would breathe no more.
2659,THE PATRON.,"Then hope of holy kind the soul sustain'd,"
2660,THE PATRON.,And not a lingering thought of earth remain'd;
2661,THE PATRON.,"Now heaven had all, and he could smile at Love,"
2662,THE PATRON.,And the wild sallies of his youth reprove;
2663,THE PATRON.,"Then could he dwell upon the tempting days,"
2664,THE PATRON.,"The proud aspiring thought, the partial praise;"
2665,THE PATRON.,"Victorious now, his worldly views were closed,"
2666,THE PATRON.,And on the bed of death the youth reposed.
2667,THE PATRON.,The father grieved--but as the poet's heart
2668,THE PATRON.,Was all unfitted for his earthly part;
2669,THE PATRON.,"As, he conceived, some other haughty fair"
2670,THE PATRON.,"Would, had he lived, have led him to despair;"
2671,THE PATRON.,"As, with this fear, the silent grave shut out"
2672,THE PATRON.,"All feverish hope, and all tormenting doubt;"
2673,THE PATRON.,"While the strong faith the pious youth possess'd,"
2674,THE PATRON.,His hope enlivening gave his sorrows rest;
2675,THE PATRON.,"Soothed by these thoughts, he felt a mournful joy"
2676,THE PATRON.,For his aspiring and devoted boy.
2677,THE PATRON.,"Meantime the news through various channels spread,"
2678,THE PATRON.,"The youth, once favour'd with such praise, was dead:"
2679,THE PATRON.,"""Emma,"" the lady cried, ""my words attend,"
2680,THE PATRON.,Your syren-smiles have kill'd your humble friend;
2681,THE PATRON.,"The hope you raised can now delude no more,"
2682,THE PATRON.,"Nor charms, that once inspired, can now restore."""
2683,THE PATRON.,"Faint was the flush of anger and of shame,"
2684,THE PATRON.,That o'er the cheek of conscious beauty came:
2685,THE PATRON.,"""You censure not,"" said she, ""the sun's bright rays,"
2686,THE PATRON.,When fools imprudent dare the dangerous gaze;
2687,THE PATRON.,"And should a stripling look till he were blind,"
2688,THE PATRON.,You would not justly call the light unkind:
2689,THE PATRON.,But is he dead? and am I to suppose
2690,THE PATRON.,"The power of poison in such looks as those?"""
2691,THE PATRON.,"She spoke, and pointing to the mirror, cast"
2692,THE PATRON.,"A pleased gay glance, and curtsied as she pass'd."
2693,THE PATRON.,"My Lord, to whom the poet's fate was told,"
2694,THE PATRON.,"Was much affected, for a man so cold:"
2695,THE PATRON.,"""Dead!"" said his lordship, ""run distracted, mad!"
2696,THE PATRON.,Upon my soul I'm sorry for the lad;
2697,THE PATRON.,And now no doubt th' obliging world will say
2698,THE PATRON.,That my harsh usage help'd him on his way:
2699,THE PATRON.,"What! I suppose, I should have nursed his muse,"
2700,THE PATRON.,And with champagne have brighten'd up his views;
2701,THE PATRON.,"Then had he made me famed my whole life long,"
2702,THE PATRON.,And stunn'd my ears with gratitude and song.
2703,THE PATRON.,Still should the father bear that I regret
2704,THE PATRON.,"Our joint misfortune--Yes! I'll not forget."""
2705,THE PATRON.,Thus they: --the father to his grave convey'd
2706,THE PATRON.,"The son he loved, and his last duties paid."
2707,THE PATRON.,"""There lies my Boy,"" he cried, ""of care bereft,"
2708,THE PATRON.,"And heaven be praised, I've not a genius left:"
2709,THE PATRON.,"No one among ye, sons! is doomed to live"
2710,THE PATRON.,On high-raised hopes of what the Great may give;
2711,THE PATRON.,"None, with exalted views and fortunes mean,"
2712,THE PATRON.,"To die in anguish, or to live in spleen:"
2713,THE PATRON.,Your pious brother soon escaped the strife
2714,THE PATRON.,"Of such contention, but it cost his life;"
2715,THE PATRON.,"You then, my sons, upon yourselves depend,"
2716,THE PATRON.,"And in your own exertions find the friend."""

2747,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Grave Jonas Kindred, Sybil Kindred's sire,"
2748,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Was six feet high, and look'd six inches higher;"
2749,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Erect, morose, determined, solemn, slow,"
2750,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Who knew the man could never cease to know:
2751,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"His faithful spouse, when Jonas was not by,"
2752,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Had a firm presence and a steady eye;
2753,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"But with her husband dropp'd her look and tone,"
2754,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And Jonas ruled unquestion'd and alone.
2755,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"He read, and oft would quote the sacred words,"
2756,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,How pious husbands of their wives were lords;
2757,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Sarah called Abraham Lord! and who could be,"
2758,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"So Jonas thought, a greater man than he?"
2759,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Himself he view'd with undisguised respect,"
2760,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And never pardon'd freedom or neglect.
2761,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"They had one daughter, and this favourite child"
2762,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Had oft the father of his spleen beguiled;
2763,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Soothed by attention from her early years,"
2764,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,She gained all wishes by her smiles or tears;
2765,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"But Sybil then was in that playful time,"
2766,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,When contradiction is not held a crime;
2767,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,When parents yield their children idle praise
2768,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,For faults corrected in their after days.
2769,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Peace in the sober house of Jonas dwelt,"
2770,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Where each his duty and his station felt:
2771,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Yet not that peace some favour'd mortals find,"
2772,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,In equal views and harmony of mind;
2773,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Not the soft peace that blesses those who love,"
2774,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Where all with one consent in union move;
2775,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,But it was that which one superior will
2776,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Commands, by making all inferiors still;"
2777,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Who bids all murmurs, all objections, cease,"
2778,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And with imperious voice announces--Peace!
2779,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"They were, to wit, a remnant of that crew,"
2780,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Who, as their foes maintain, their Sovereign slew;"
2781,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"An independent race, precise, correct,"
2782,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Who ever married in the kindred sect:
2783,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,No son or daughter of their order wed
2784,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,A friend to England's king who lost his head;
2785,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Cromwell was still their Saint, and when they met,"
2786,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,They mourn'd that Saints were not our rulers yet.
2787,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Fix'd were their habits; they arose betimes,"
2788,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Then pray'd their hour, and sang their party-rhymes:"
2789,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Their meals were plenteous, regular and plain;"
2790,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,The trade of Jonas brought him constant gain;
2791,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Vender of hops and malt, of coals and corn -"
2792,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And, like his father, he was merchant born:"
2793,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Neat was their house; each table, chair, and stool,"
2794,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Stood in its place, or moving moved by rule;"
2795,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,No lively print or picture graced the room;
2796,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,A plain brown paper lent its decent gloom;
2797,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"But here the eye, in glancing round, survey'd"
2798,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,A small recess that seem'd for china made;
2799,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Such pleasing pictures seem'd this pencill'd ware,"
2800,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,That few would search for nobler objects there -
2801,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Yet, turn'd by chosen friends, and there appear'd"
2802,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"His stern, strong features, whom they all revered;"
2803,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,For there in lofty air was seen to stand
2804,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,The bold Protector of the conquer'd land;
2805,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Drawn in that look with which he wept and swore,"
2806,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Turn'd out the Members, and made fast the door,"
2807,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Ridding the House of every knave and drone,"
2808,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Forced, though it grieved his soul, to rule alone."
2809,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The stern still smile each friend approving gave,"
2810,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Then turn'd the view, and all again were grave."
2811,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"There stood a clock, though small the owner's need,"
2812,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,For habit told when all things should proceed;
2813,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Few their amusements, but when friends appear'd,"
2814,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,They with the world's distress their spirits cheer'd;
2815,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The nation's guilt, that would not long endure"
2816,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,The reign of men so modest and so pure:
2817,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Their town was large, and seldom pass'd a day"
2818,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"But some had fail'd, and others gone astray;"
2819,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Clerks had absconded, wives eloped, girls flown"
2820,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"To Gretna-Green, or sons rebellious grown;"
2821,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Quarrels and fires arose;--and it was plain
2822,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,The times were bad; the Saints had ceased to reign!
2823,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"A few yet lived, to languish and to mourn"
2824,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,For good old manners never to return.
2825,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Jonas had sisters, and of these was one"
2826,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Who lost a husband and an only son:
2827,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Twelve months her sables she in sorrow wore,"
2828,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And mourn'd so long that she could mourn no more.
2829,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Distant from Jonas, and from all her race,"
2830,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,She now resided in a lively place;
2831,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"There, by the sect unseen, at whist she play'd,"
2832,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Nor was of churchman or their church afraid:
2833,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"If much of this the graver brother heard,"
2834,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"He something censured, but he little fear'd;"
2835,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"He knew her rich and frugal; for the rest,"
2836,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"He felt no care, or, if he felt, suppress'd:"
2837,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Nor for companion when she ask'd her Niece,"
2838,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Had he suspicions that disturb'd his peace;
2839,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Frugal and rich, these virtues as a charm"
2840,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Preserved the thoughtful man from all alarm;
2841,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"An infant yet, she soon would home return,"
2842,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Nor stay the manners of the world to learn;
2843,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Meantime his boys would all his care engross,"
2844,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And be his comforts if he felt the loss.
2845,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The sprightly Sybil, pleased and unconfined,"
2846,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Felt the pure pleasure of the op'ning mind:
2847,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,All here was gay and cheerful--all at home
2848,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Unvaried quiet and unruffled gloom:
2849,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"There were no changes, and amusements few; -"
2850,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Here all was varied, wonderful, and new;"
2851,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"There were plain meals, plain dresses, and grave looks -"
2852,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Here, gay companions and amusing books;"
2853,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And the young Beauty soon began to taste
2854,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,The light vocations of the scene she graced.
2855,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,A man of business feels it as a crime
2856,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,On calls domestic to consume his time;
2857,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Yet this grave man had not so cold a heart,"
2858,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,But with his daughter he was grieved to part:
2859,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And he demanded that in every year
2860,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,The Aunt and Niece should at his house appear.
2861,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Yes! we must go, my child, and by our dress"
2862,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,A grave conformity of mind express;
2863,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Must sing at meeting, and from cards refrain,"
2864,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The more t'enjoy when we return again."""
2865,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Thus spake the Aunt, and the discerning child"
2866,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Was pleased to learn how fathers are beguiled.
2867,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Her artful part the young dissembler took,"
2868,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And from the matron caught th' approving look:
2869,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"When thrice the friends had met, excuse was sent"
2870,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"For more delay, and Jonas was content;"
2871,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Till a tall maiden by her sire was seen,"
2872,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,In all the bloom and beauty of sixteen;
2873,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"He gazed admiring;--she, with visage prim,"
2874,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Glanced an arch look of gravity on him;
2875,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"For she was gay at heart, but wore disguise,"
2876,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And stood a vestal in her father's eyes:
2877,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Pure, pensive, simple, sad; the damsel's heart,"
2878,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"When Jonas praised, reproved her for the part."
2879,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"For Sybil, fond of pleasure, gay and light,"
2880,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Had still a secret bias to the right;
2881,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Vain as she was--and flattery made her vain -
2882,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Her simulation gave her bosom pain.
2883,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Again return'd, the Matron and the Niece"
2884,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Found the late quiet gave their joy increase;
2885,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The aunt infirm, no more her visits paid,"
2886,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,But still with her sojourn'd the favourite maid.
2887,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Letters were sent when franks could be procured,"
2888,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And when they could not, silence was endured;"
2889,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"All were in health, and if they older grew,"
2890,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,It seem'd a fact that none among them knew;
2891,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The aunt and niece still led a pleasant life,"
2892,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And quiet days had Jonas and his wife.
2893,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Near him a Widow dwelt of worthy fame,"
2894,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Like his her manners, and her creed the same;"
2895,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The wealth her husband left, her care retain'd"
2896,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"For one tall Youth, and widow she remain'd;"
2897,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"His love respectful all her care repaid,"
2898,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Her wishes watch'd, and her commands obey'd."
2899,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Sober he was and grave from early youth,"
2900,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Mindful of forms, but more intent on truth:"
2901,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"In a light drab he uniformly dress'd,"
2902,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And look serene th' unruffled mind express'd;
2903,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"A hat with ample verge his brows o'erspread,"
2904,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And his brown locks curl'd graceful on his head;
2905,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Yet might observers in his speaking eye
2906,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Some observation, some acuteness spy;"
2907,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The friendly thought it keen, the treacherous deem'd it sly."
2908,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Yet not a crime could foe or friend detect,"
2909,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"His actions all were, like his speech, correct;"
2910,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And they who jested on a mind so sound,"
2911,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Upon his virtues must their laughter found;
2912,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Chaste, sober, solemn, and devout they named"
2913,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Him who was thus, and not of this ashamed."
2914,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Such were the virtues Jonas found in one
2915,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,In whom he warmly wish'd to find a son:
2916,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Three years had pass'd since he had Sybil seen;
2917,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"But she was doubtless what she once had been,"
2918,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Lovely and mild, obedient and discreet;"
2919,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,The pair must love whenever they should meet;
2920,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Then ere the widow or her son should choose
2921,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Some happier maid, he would explain his views:"
2922,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Now she, like him, was politic and shrewd,"
2923,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,With strong desire of lawful gain embued;
2924,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"To all he said, she bow'd with much respect,"
2925,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Pleased to comply, yet seeming to reject;"
2926,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Cool and yet eager, each admired the strength"
2927,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Of the opponent, and agreed at length:"
2928,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"As a drawn battle shows to each a force,"
2929,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Powerful as his, he honours it of course;"
2930,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"So in these neighbours, each the power discern'd,"
2931,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And gave the praise that was to each return'd.
2932,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Jonas now ask'd his daughter--and the Aunt,"
2933,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Though loth to lose her, was obliged to grant:  -"
2934,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"But would not Sybil to the matron cling,"
2935,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And fear to leave the shelter of her wing?
2936,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"No! in the young there lives a love of change,"
2937,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And to the easy they prefer the strange!
2938,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Then, too, the joys she once pursued with zeal,"
2939,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"From whist and visits sprung, she ceased to feel:"
2940,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"When with the matrons Sybil first sat down,"
2941,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"To cut for partners and to stake her crown,"
2942,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"This to the youthful maid preferment seem'd,"
2943,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Who thought what woman she was then esteem'd;
2944,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"But in few years, when she perceived, indeed,"
2945,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The real woman to the girl succeed,"
2946,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"No longer tricks and honours fill'd her mind,"
2947,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"But other feelings, not so well defined;"
2948,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"She then reluctant grew, and thought it hard"
2949,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,To sit and ponder o'er an ugly card;
2950,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Rather the nut-tree shade the nymph preferr'd,"
2951,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Pleased with the pensive gloom and evening bird;
2952,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Thither, from company retired, she took"
2953,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The silent walk, or read the fav'rite book."
2954,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The father's letter, sudden, short, and kind,"
2955,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Awaked her wonder, and disturb'd her mind;"
2956,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"She found new dreams upon her fancy seize,"
2957,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Wild roving thoughts and endless reveries.
2958,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,The parting came;--and when the Aunt perceived
2959,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The tears of Sybil, and how much she grieved -"
2960,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"To love for her that tender grief she laid,"
2961,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"That various, soft, contending passions made."
2962,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"When Sybil rested in her father's arms,"
2963,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,His pride exulted in a daughter's charms;
2964,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"A maid accomplish'd he was pleased to find,"
2965,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Nor seem'd the form more lovely than the mind:
2966,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"But when the fit of pride and fondness fled,"
2967,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,He saw his judgment by his hopes misled;
2968,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"High were the lady's spirits, far more free"
2969,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Her mode of speaking than a maid's should be;
2970,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Too much, as Jonas thought, she seem'd to know,"
2971,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And all her knowledge was disposed to show;
2972,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Too gay her dress, like theirs who idly dote"
2973,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,On a young coxcomb or a coxcomb's coat;
2974,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"In foolish spirits when our friends appear,"
2975,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And vainly grave when not a man is near."""
2976,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Thus Jonas, adding to his sorrow blame,"
2977,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And terms disdainful to a Sister's name:
2978,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""The sinful wretch has by her arts denied"
2979,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The ductile spirit of my darling child."""
2980,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""The maid is virtuous,"" said the dame--Quoth he,"
2981,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Let her give proof, by acting virtuously:"
2982,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Is it in gaping when the Elders pray?
2983,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,In reading nonsense half a summer's day?
2984,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"In those mock forms that she delights to trace,"
2985,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Or her loud laughs in Hezekiah's face?
2986,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,She--O Susannah!--to the world belongs;
2987,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"She loves the follies of its idle throngs,"
2988,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And reads soft tales of love, and sings love's soft'ning songs."
2989,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"But, as our friend is yet delay'd in town,"
2990,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,We must prepare her till the Youth comes down:
2991,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,You shall advise the maiden; I will threat;
2992,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Her fears and hopes may yield us comfort yet."""
2993,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Now the grave father took the lass aside,"
2994,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Demanding sternly, ""Wilt thou be a bride?"""
2995,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"She answer'd, calling up an air sedate,"
2996,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""I have not vow'd against the holy state."""
2997,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""No folly, Sybil,"" said the parent; ""know"
2998,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,What to their parents virtuous maidens owe:
2999,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"A worthy, wealthy youth, whom I approve,"
3000,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Must thou prepare to honour and to love.
3001,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Formal to thee his air and dress may seem,"
3002,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,But the good youth is worthy of esteem:
3003,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Shouldst thou with rudeness treat him; of disdain
3004,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Should he with justice or of slight complain,"
3005,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Or of one taunting speech give certain proof,"

3007,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""My aunt,"" said Sybil,"" will with pride protect"

3012,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And, utt'ring something 'twixt a groan and sigh,"
3013,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Left the determined maid, her doubtful mother by."
3014,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Hear me,"" she said; ""incline thy heart, my child,"
3015,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And fix thy fancy on a man so mild:
3016,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Thy father, Sybil, never could be moved"
3017,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"By one who loved him, or by one he loved."
3018,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Union like ours is but a bargain made

3022,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""But will he love?"" said Sybil; ""I am told"
3023,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"That these mild creatures are by nature cold."""
3024,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Alas!"" the matron answer'd, ""much I dread"
3025,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,That dangerous love by which the young are led!
3026,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"That love is earthy; you the creature prize,"
3027,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And trust your feelings and believe your eyes:
3028,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Can eyes and feelings inward worth descry?
3029,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"No! my fair daughter, on our choice rely!"
3030,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Your love, like that display'd upon the stage,"
3031,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Indulged is folly, and opposed is rage; -"
3032,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"More prudent love our sober couples show,"
3033,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"All that to mortal beings, mortals owe;"
3034,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"All flesh is grass--before you give a heart,"
3035,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Remember, Sybil, that in death you part;"
3036,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And should your husband die before your love,"
3037,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,What needless anguish must a widow prove!
3038,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"No! my fair child, let all such visions cease;"
3039,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Yield but esteem, and only try for peace."""
3040,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""I must be loved,"" said Sybil; ""I must see"
3041,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,The man in terrors who aspires to me;
3042,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"At my forbidding frown his heart must ache,"
3043,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"His tongue must falter, and his frame must shake:"
3044,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And if I grant him at my feet to kneel,"
3045,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"What trembling, fearful pleasure must he feel;"
3046,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Nay, such the raptures that my smiles inspire,"
3047,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"That reason's self must for a time retire."""
3048,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Alas! for good Josiah,"" said the dame,"
3049,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""These wicked thoughts would fill his soul with shame;"
3050,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,He kneel and tremble at a thing of dust!
3051,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"He cannot, child:""--the Child replied, ""He must."""
3052,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,They ceased:  the matron left her with a frown;
3053,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,So Jonas met her when the Youth came down:
3054,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Behold,"" said he, ""thy future spouse attends;"
3055,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Receive him, daughter, as the best of friends;"
3056,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Observe, respect him--humble be each word,"
3057,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"That welcomes home thy husband and thy lord."""
3058,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Forewarn'd, thought Sybil, with a bitter smile,"
3059,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,I shall prepare my manner and my style.
3060,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Ere yet Josiah enter'd on his task,"
3061,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The father met him--""Deign to wear a mask"
3062,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"A few dull days, Josiah--but a few -"
3063,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"It is our duty, and the sex's due;"
3064,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"I wore it once, and every grateful wife"
3065,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Repays it with obedience through her life:
3066,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Have no regard to Sybil's dress, have none"
3067,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"To her pert language, to her flippant tone:"
3068,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Henceforward thou shalt rule unquestion'd and alone;
3069,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And she thy pleasure in thy looks shall seek -
3070,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"How she shall dress, and whether she may speak."""
3071,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"A sober smile returned the Youth, and said,"
3072,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Can I cause fear, who am myself afraid?"""
3073,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Sybil, meantime, sat thoughtful in her room,"
3074,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And often wonder'd--""Will the creature come?"
3075,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Nothing shall tempt, shall force me to bestow"
3076,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"My hand upon him,--yet I wish to know."""
3077,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The door unclosed, and she beheld her sire"
3078,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Lead in the Youth, then hasten to retire;"
3079,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Daughter, my friend--my daughter, friend,"" he cried,"
3080,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And gave a meaning look, and stepp'd aside:"
3081,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"That look contained a mingled threat and prayer,"
3082,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Do take him, child,--offend him if you dare."""
3083,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The couple gazed--were silent, and the maid"
3084,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Look'd in his face, to make the man afraid;"
3085,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The man, unmoved, upon the maiden cast"
3086,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,A steady view--so salutation pass'd:
3087,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,But in this instant Sybil's eye had seen
3088,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The tall fair person, and the still staid mien;"
3089,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The glow that temp'rance o'er the cheek had spread,"
3090,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Where the soft down half veil'd the purest red;
3091,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And the serene deportment that proclaim'd
3092,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"A heart unspotted, and a life unblamed:"
3093,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"But then with these she saw attire too plain,"
3094,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The pale brown coat, though worn without a stain;"
3095,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The formal air, and something of the pride"
3096,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,That indicates the wealth it seems to hide;
3097,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And looks that were not, she conceived, exempt"
3098,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"From a proud pity, or a sly contempt."
3099,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Josiah's eyes had their employment too,"
3100,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Engaged and soften'd by so bright a view;
3101,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"A fair and meaning face, an eye of fire,"
3102,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"That check'd the bold, and made the free retire:"
3103,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,But then with these he marked the studied dress
3104,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And lofty air, that scorn or pride express;"
3105,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"With that insidious look, that seem'd to hide"
3106,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,In an affected smile the scorn and pride;
3107,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And if his mind the virgin's meaning caught,"
3108,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,He saw a foe with treacherous purpose fraught -
3109,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Captive the heart to take, and to reject it, caught."
3110,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Silent they sat--thought Sybil, that he seeks"
3111,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Something, no doubt; I wonder if he speaks:"
3112,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Scarcely she wonder'd, when these accents fell"
3113,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Slow in her ear--""Fair maiden, art thou well?"""
3114,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Art thou physician?"" she replied; ""my hand,"
3115,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"My pulse, at least, shall be at thy command."""
3116,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"She said--and saw, surprised, Josiah kneel,"
3117,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,And gave his lips the offer'd pulse to feel;
3118,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"The rosy colour rising in her cheek,"
3119,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Seem'd that surprise unmix'd with wrath to speak;
3120,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Then sternness she assumed, and--""Doctor, tell;"
3121,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Thy words cannot alarm me--am I well?"""
3122,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Thou art,"" said he; ""and yet thy dress so light,"
3123,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"I do conceive, some danger must excite:"""
3124,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""In whom?"" said Sybil, with a look demure:"
3125,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""In more,"" said he, ""than I expect to cure; -"
3126,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"I, in thy light luxuriant robe behold"
3127,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Want and excess, abounding and yet cold;"
3128,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Here needed, there display'd, in many a wanton fold;"
3129,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Both health and beauty, learned authors show,"
3130,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"From a just medium in our clothing flow."""
3131,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Proceed, good doctor; if so great my need,"
3132,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"What is thy fee?  Good doctor! pray proceed."""
3133,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Large is my fee, fair lady, but I take"
3134,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,None till some progress in my cure I make:
3135,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Thou hast disease, fair maiden; thou art vain;"
3136,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Within that face sit insult and disdain;
3137,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Thou art enamour'd of thyself; my art

3141,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And such thy beauty, damsel, that I might,"
3142,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"But for thy pride, feel danger in thy sight,"
3143,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And lose my present peace in dreams of vain delight."""
3144,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""And can thy patients,"" said the nymph ""endure"

3146,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Such is my hope, fair damsel; thou, I find,"

3150,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Thou hast sought pleasure in the world around,"
3151,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,That in thine own pure bosom should be found;

3158,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Turn then, fair creature, from a world of sin,"
3159,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And seek the jewel happiness within."""
3160,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Speak'st thou at meeting?"" said the nymph; ""thy speech"

3164,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Yea, with good will.""--""Then know 'tis thy complaint,"

3176,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Does that long-skirted drab, that over-nice"
3177,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And formal clothing, prove a scorn of vice?"
3178,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Then for thine accent--what in sound can be
3179,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,So void of grace as dull monotony?
3180,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Love has a thousand varied notes to move

3196,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Then left the Youth, who, lost in his retreat,"
3197,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Pass'd the good matron on her garden-seat;
3198,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"His looks were troubled, and his air, once mild"
3199,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"And calm, was hurried: --""My audacious child!"""
3200,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Exclaim'd the dame, ""I read what she has done"
3201,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,In thy displeasure--Ah! the thoughtless one:
3202,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"But yet, Josiah, to my stern good man"
3203,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Speak of the maid as mildly as you can:
3204,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Can you not seem to woo a little while

3213,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"His deeds were friendly, and his words were true:"
3214,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""But to address this vixen is a task"
3215,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"He is ashamed to take, and I to ask."""
3216,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,Soon as the father from Josiah learn'd
3217,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"What pass'd with Sybil, he the truth discern'd."
3218,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""He loves,"" the man exclaim'd, ""he loves, 'tis plain,"

3221,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Born as she is of wilfulness and pride."""
3222,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"With anger fraught, but willing to persuade,"

3231,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Unhappy child! what labour will it cost"
3232,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"To win him back!""--""I do not think him lost."""
3233,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Courts he then (trifler!) insult and disdain?"" -"
3234,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""No; but from these he courts me to refrain."""
3235,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""Then hear me, Sybil:  should Josiah leave"
3236,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"Thy father's house?""--""My father's child would grieve."""
3237,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"""That is of grace, and if he come again"
3238,THE FRANK COURTSHIP.,"To speak of love?""--""I might from grief refrain."""

3331,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Had left him all industrious men require,"
3332,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Saw the pale Beauty,--and her shape and air"
3333,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Engaged him much, and yet he must forbear:"
3334,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""For my small farm what can the damsel do?"""
3335,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"He said,--then stopp'd to take another view:"
3336,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""Pity so sweet a lass will nothing learn"
3337,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Of household cares,--for what can beauty earn"
3338,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"By those small arts which they at school attain,"
3339,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"That keep them useless, and yet make them vain?"""
3340,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"This luckless Damsel look'd the village round,"
3341,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"To find a friend, and one was quickly found:"
3342,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"A pensive Widow, whose mild air and dress"
3343,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Pleased the sad nymph, who wish'd her soul's distress"
3344,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"To one so seeming kind, confiding, to confess."
3345,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""What Lady that?"" the anxious lass inquired,"
3346,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Who then beheld the one she most admired:
3347,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""Here,"" said the Brother, ""are no ladies seen -"
3348,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,That is a widow dwelling on the Green;
3349,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"A dainty dame, who can but barely live"
3350,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"On her poor pittance, yet contrives to give;"
3351,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"She happier days has known, but seems at ease,"
3352,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And you may call her lady if you please:
3353,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"But if you wish, good sister, to improve,"
3354,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"You shall see twenty better worth your love."""
3355,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"These Nancy met; but, spite of all they taught,"
3356,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,This useless Widow was the one she sought:
3357,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,The father growl'd; but said he knew no harm
3358,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,In such connexion that could give alarm;
3359,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""And if we thwart the trifler in her course,"
3360,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"'Tis odds against us she will take a worse."""
3361,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Then met the friends; the Widow heard the sigh
3362,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,That ask'd at once compassion and reply:  -
3363,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""Would you, my child, converse with one so poor,"
3364,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Yours were the kindness--yonder is my door:
3365,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"And, save the time that we in public pray,"
3366,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"From that poor cottage I but rarely stray."""
3367,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"There went the nymph, and made her strong complaints,"
3368,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Painting her woe as injured feeling paints.
3369,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""Oh, dearest friend! do think how one must feel,"
3370,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Shock'd all day long, and sicken'd every meal;"
3371,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Could you behold our kitchen (and to you
3372,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"A scene so shocking must indeed be new),"
3373,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"A mind like yours, with true refinement graced,"
3374,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Would let no vulgar scenes pollute your taste:
3375,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"And yet, in truth, from such a polish'd mind"
3376,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"All base ideas must resistance find,"
3377,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"And sordid pictures from the fancy pass,"
3378,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,As the breath startles from the polish'd glass.
3379,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""Here you enjoy a sweet romantic scene,"
3380,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Without so pleasant, and within so clean;"
3381,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"These twining jess'mines, what delicious gloom"
3382,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And soothing fragrance yield they to the room!
3383,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"What lovely garden! there you oft retire,"
3384,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And tales of woe and tenderness admire.
3385,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"In that neat case your books, in order placed,"
3386,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Soothe the full soul, and charm the cultur'd taste;"
3387,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"And thus, while all about you wears a charm,"
3388,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"How must you scorn the Farmer and the Farm!"""
3389,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"The Widow smiled, and ""Know you not,"" said she,"
3390,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""How much these farmers scorn or pity me;"
3391,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Who see what you admire, and laugh at all they see?"
3392,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"True, their opinion alters not my fate,"
3393,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,By falsely judging of an humble state:
3394,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"This garden you with such delight behold,"
3395,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Tempts not a feeble dame who dreads the cold;
3396,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"These plants which please so well your livelier sense,"
3397,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,To mine but little of their sweets dispense:
3398,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Books soon are painful to my failing sight,"
3399,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And oftener read from duty than delight;
3400,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"(Yet let me own, that I can sometimes find"
3401,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Both joy and duty in the act combined;)
3402,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"But view me rightly, you will see no more"
3403,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Than a poor female, willing to be poor;"
3404,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Happy indeed, but not in books nor flowers,"
3405,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Not in fair dreams, indulged in earlier hours,"
3406,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Of never-tasted joys;--such visions shun,"
3407,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"My youthful friend, nor scorn the Farmer's Son."""
3408,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""Nay,"" said the Damsel, nothing pleased to see"
3409,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"A friend's advice could like a Father's be,"
3410,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""Bless'd in your cottage, you must surely smile"
3411,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,At those who live in our detested style:
3412,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,To my Lucinda's sympathising heart
3413,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Could I my prospects and my griefs impart;,"
3414,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"She would console me; but I dare not show,"
3415,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Ills that would wound her tender soul to know:
3416,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"And I confess, it shocks my pride to tell"
3417,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,The secrets of the prison where I dwell;
3418,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,For that dear maiden would be shock'd to feel
3419,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,The secrets I should shudder to reveal;
3420,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"When told her friend was by a parent ask'd,"
3421,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,'Fed you the swine?'--Good heaven! how I am task'd! -
3422,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,What! can you smile? Ah! smile not at the grief
3423,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"That woos your pity and demands relief."""
3424,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""Trifles, my love:  you take a false alarm;"
3425,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Think, I beseech you, better of the Farm:"
3426,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Duties in every state demand your care,"
3427,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And light are those that will require it there.
3428,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Fix on the Youth a favouring eye, and these,"
3429,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"To him pertaining, or as his, will please."""
3430,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""What words,"" the Lass replied, ""offend my ear!"
3431,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Try you my patience? Can you be sincere?
3432,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And am I told a willing hand to give
3433,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"To a rude farmer, and with rustics live?"
3434,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Far other fate was yours;--some gentle youth
3435,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Admir'd your beauty, and avow'd his truth;"
3436,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"The power of love prevail'd, and freely both"
3437,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Gave the fond heart, and pledged the binding oath;"
3438,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"And then the rival's plot, the parent's power,"
3439,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"And jealous fears, drew on the happy hour:"
3440,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Ah! let not memory lose the blissful view,"
3441,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"But fairly show what love has done for you."""
3442,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""Agreed, my daughter; what my heart has known"
3443,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Of Love's strange power, shall be with frankness shown:"
3444,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"But let me warn you, that experience finds"
3445,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Few of the scenes that lively hope designs."""
3446,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""Mysterious all,"" said Nancy; ""you, I know,"
3447,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Have suffered much; now deign the grief to show, -"
3448,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"I am your friend, and so prepare my heart"
3449,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"In all your sorrows to receive a part."""
3450,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"The Widow answer'd:  ""I had once, like you,"
3451,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Such thoughts of love; no dream is more untrue;
3452,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"You judge it fated, and decreed to dwell"
3453,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"In youthful hearts, which nothing can expel,"
3454,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"A passion doom'd to reign, and irresistible."
3455,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"The struggling mind, when once subdued, in vain"
3456,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Rejects the fury or defies the pain;
3457,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"The strongest reason fails the flames t'allay,"
3458,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And resolution droops and faints away:
3459,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Hence, when the destined lovers meet, they prove"
3460,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,At once the force of this all-powerful love;
3461,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Each from that period feels the mutual smart,"
3462,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Nor seeks to cure it--heart is changed for heart;
3463,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Nor is there peace till they delighted stand,"
3464,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"And, at the altar--hand is join'd to hand."
3465,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""Alas! my child, there are who, dreaming so,"
3466,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Waste their fresh youth, and waking feel the woe."
3467,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,There is no spirit sent the heart to move
3468,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,With such prevailing and alarming love;
3469,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Passion to reason will submit--or why
3470,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Should wealthy maids the poorest swains deny?
3471,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Or how could classes and degrees create
3472,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,The slightest bar to such resistless fate?
3473,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Yet high and low, you see, forbear to mix;"
3474,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,No beggars' eyes the heart of kings transfix;
3475,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"And who but am'rous peers or nobles sigh,"
3476,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,When titled beauties pass triumphant by?
3477,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"For reason wakes, proud wishes to reprove;"
3478,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"You cannot hope, and therefore dare not love;"
3479,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"All would be safe, did we at first inquire -"
3480,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,'Does reason sanction what our hearts desire?'
3481,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"But quitting precept, let example show"
3482,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,What joys from Love uncheck'd by prudence flow.
3483,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""A Youth my father in his office placed,"
3484,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Of humble fortune, but with sense and taste;"
3485,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"But he was thin and pale, had downcast looks:"
3486,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"He studied much, and pored upon his books:"
3487,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Confused he was when seen, and when he saw"
3488,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Me or my sisters, would in haste withdraw;"
3489,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"And had this youth departed with the year,"
3490,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,His loss had cost us neither sigh nor tear.
3491,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""But with my father still the youth remain'd,"
3492,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And more reward and kinder notice gain'd:
3493,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"He often, reading, to the garden stray'd,"
3494,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Where I by books or musing was delay'd;
3495,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"This to discourse in summer evenings led,"
3496,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Of these same evenings, or of what we read:"
3497,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,On such occasions we were much alone;
3498,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"But, save the look, the manner, and the tone,"
3499,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"(These might have meaning,) all that we discuss'd"
3500,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,We could with pleasure to a parent trust.
3501,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""At length 'twas friendship--and my Friend and I"
3502,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Said we were happy, and began to sigh;"
3503,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"My sisters first, and then my father, found"
3504,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,That we were wandering o'er enchanted ground:
3505,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"But he had troubles in his own aifairs,"
3506,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And would not bear addition to his cares:
3507,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"With pity moved, yet angry, 'Child,' said he,"
3508,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,'Will you embrace contempt and beggary?'
3509,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Can you endure to see each other cursed
3510,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"By want, of every human woe the worst?"
3511,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Warring for ever with distress, in dread"
3512,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Either of begging or of wanting bread;
3513,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"While poverty, with unrelenting force,"
3514,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Will your own offspring from your love divorce;
3515,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"They, through your folly, must be doom'd to pine,"
3516,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"And you deplore your passion, or resign;"
3517,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"For if it die, what good will then remain?"
3518,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"And if it live, it doubles every pain.'"""
3519,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""But you were true,"" exclaim'd the Lass,"" and fled"
3520,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"The tyrant's power who fill'd your soul with dread?"""
3521,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""But,"" said the smiling Friend, ""he fill'd my mouth with bread:"
3522,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And in what other place that bread to gain
3523,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"We long consider'd, and we sought in vain:"
3524,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"This was my twentieth year,--at thirty-five"
3525,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Our hope was fainter, yet our love alive;"
3526,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"So many years in anxious doubt had pass'd."""
3527,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""Then,"" said the Damsel, ""you were bless'd at last?"""
3528,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"A smile again adorn'd the Widow's face,"
3529,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,But soon a starting tear usurp'd its place.
3530,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""Slow pass'd the heavy years, and each had more"
3531,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Pains and vexations than the years before.
3532,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"My father fail'd; his family was rent,"
3533,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And to new states his grieving daughters sent:
3534,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Each to more thriving kindred found a way,"
3535,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Guests without welcome,--servants without pay;"
3536,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Our parting hour was grievous; still I feel
3537,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"The sad, sweet converse at our final meal;"
3538,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Our father then reveal'd his former fears,"
3539,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Cause of his sternness, and then join'd our tears:"
3540,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Kindly he strove our feelings to repress,"
3541,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"But died, and left us heirs to his distress."
3542,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"The rich, as humble friends, my sisters chose;"
3543,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,I with a wealthy widow sought repose;
3544,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Who with a chilling frown her friend received,"
3545,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Bade me rejoice, and wonder'd that I grieved:"
3546,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"In vain my anxious lover tried his skill,"
3547,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"To rise in life, he was dependent still:"
3548,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"We met in grief, nor can I paint the fears"
3549,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Of these unhappy, troubled, trying years:"
3550,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Our dying hopes and stronger fears between,"
3551,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,We felt no season peaceful or serene;
3552,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Our fleeting joys, like meteors in the night,"
3553,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Shone on our gloom with inauspicious light;
3554,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"And then domestic sorrows, till the mind,"
3555,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Worn with distresses, to despair inclined;"
3556,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Add too the ill that from the passion flows,"
3557,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"When its contemptuous frown the world bestows,"
3558,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"The peevish spirit caused by long delay,"
3559,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"When, being gloomy, we contemn the gay,"
3560,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"When, being wretched, we incline to hate"
3561,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And censure others in a happier state;
3562,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Yet loving still, and still compell'd to move"
3563,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,In the sad labyrinth of lingering love:
3564,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"While you, exempt from want, despair, alarm,"
3565,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"May wed--oh! take the Farmer and the Farm."""
3566,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""Nay,"" said the nymph, ""joy smiled on you at last?"""
3567,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""Smiled for a moment,"" she replied, ""and pass'd:"
3568,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"My lover still the same dull means pursued,"
3569,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Assistant call'd, but kept in servitude;"
3570,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"His spirits wearied in the prime of life,"
3571,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,By fears and wishes in eternal strife;
3572,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,At length he urged impatient--'Now consent;
3573,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"With thee united, Fortune may relent.'"
3574,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"I paused, consenting; but a Friend arose,"
3575,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Pleased a fair view, though distant, to disclose;"
3576,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,From the rough ocean we beheld a gleam
3577,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Of joy, as transient as the joys we dream;"
3578,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"By lying hopes deceived, my friend retired,"
3579,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And sail'd--was wounded--reach'd us--and expired!
3580,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"You shall behold his grave; and when I die,"
3581,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"There--but 'tis folly--I request to lie."""
3582,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""Thus,"" said the lass, ""to joy you bade adieu!"
3583,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,But how a widow?--that cannot be true:
3584,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Or was it force, in some unhappy hour,"
3585,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"That placed you, grieving, in a tyrant's power?"""
3586,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""Force, my young friend, when forty years are fled,"
3587,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Is what a woman seldom has to dread;
3588,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"She needs no brazen locks nor guarding walls,"
3589,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And seldom comes a lover though she calls:
3590,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Yet, moved by fancy, one approved my face,"
3591,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Though time and tears had wrought it much disgrace.
3592,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"""The man I married was sedate and meek,"
3593,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And spoke of love as men in earnest speak;
3594,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Poor as I was, he ceaseless sought for years,"
3595,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,A heart in sorrow and a face in tears:
3596,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,That heart I gave not; and 'twas long before
3597,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"I gave attention, and then nothing more:"
3598,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"But in my breast some grateful feeling rose,"
3599,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,For one whose love so sad a subject chose;
3600,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Till long delaying, fearing to repent,"
3601,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"But grateful still, I gave a cold assent."
3602,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Thus we were wed; no fault had I to find,"
3603,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And he but one:  my heart could not be kind:
3604,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Alas! of every early hope bereft,"
3605,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,There was no fondness in my bosom left;
3606,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"So had I told him, but had told in vain,"
3607,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,He lived but to indulge me and complain:
3608,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,His was this cottage; he inclosed this ground.
3609,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And planted all these blooming shrubs around;
3610,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"He to my room these curious trifles brought,"
3611,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And with assiduous love my pleasure sought;
3612,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"He lived to please me, and I ofttimes strove,"
3613,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Smiling, to thank his unrequited love:"
3614,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"'Teach me,' he cried, 'that pensive mind to ease,"
3615,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,For all my pleasure is the hope to please.'
3616,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Serene though heavy, were the days we spent,"
3617,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Yet kind each word, and gen'rous each intent;"
3618,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"But his dejection lessen'd every day,"
3619,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,And to a placid kindness died away:
3620,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"In tranquil ease we pass'd our latter years,"
3621,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"By griefs untroubled, unassail'd by fears."
3622,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,Let not romantic views your bosom sway;
3623,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Yield to your duties, and their call obey:"
3624,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Fly not a Youth, frank, honest, and sincere;"
3625,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Observe his merits, and his passion hear!"
3626,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"'Tis true, no hero, but a farmer, sues -"
3627,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Slow in his speech, but worthy in his views;"
3628,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"With him you cannot that affliction prove,"
3629,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,That rends the bosom of the poor in love:
3630,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Health, comfort, competence, and cheerful days,"
3631,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Your friends' approval, and your father's praise,"
3632,THE WIDOW'S TALE.,"Will crown the deed, and you escape their fate"

3965,THE MOTHER.,"Lucy, meantime, though threaten'd and distress'd,"
3966,THE MOTHER.,Against her marriage made a strong protest:
3967,THE MOTHER.,All was domestic war; the Aunt rebell'd
3968,THE MOTHER.,"Against the sovereign will, and was expell'd;"
3969,THE MOTHER.,"And every power was tried, and every art,"

4003,THE MOTHER.,Something had been her bosom to divide;
4004,THE MOTHER.,"Now heaven had all, for in her holiest views"
4005,THE MOTHER.,She saw the matron whom she fear'd to lose;
4006,THE MOTHER.,"While from her parent, the dejected maid"
4007,THE MOTHER.,"Forced the unpleasant thought, or thinking pray'd."
4008,THE MOTHER.,"Surprised, the mother saw the languid frame,"
4009,THE MOTHER.,"And felt indignant, yet forbore to blame;"
4010,THE MOTHER.,"Once with a frown she cried, ""And do you mean"
4011,THE MOTHER.,"To die of love--the folly of fifteen?"""
4012,THE MOTHER.,"But as her anger met with no reply,"
4013,THE MOTHER.,She let the gentle girl in quiet die;
4014,THE MOTHER.,"And to her sister wrote, impell'd by pain,"
4015,THE MOTHER.,"""Come quickly, Martha, or you come in vain."""
4016,THE MOTHER.,"Lucy meantime profess'd with joy sincere,"
4017,THE MOTHER.,"That nothing held, employ'd, engaged her here."
4018,THE MOTHER.,"""I am an humble actor, doom'd to play"
4019,THE MOTHER.,"A part obscure, and then to glide away:"
4020,THE MOTHER.,"Incurious how the great or happy shine,"
4021,THE MOTHER.,Or who have parts obscure and sad as mine;
4022,THE MOTHER.,"In its best prospect I but wish'd for life,"
4023,THE MOTHER.,"To be th' assiduous, gentle, useful wife;"
4024,THE MOTHER.,"That lost, with wearied mind, and spirit poor,"
4025,THE MOTHER.,"I drop my efforts, and can act no more;"
4026,THE MOTHER.,With growing joy I feel my spirits tend
4027,THE MOTHER.,"To that last scene where all my duties end."""
4028,THE MOTHER.,"Hope, ease, delight, the thoughts of dying gave,"
4029,THE MOTHER.,Till Lucy spoke with fondness of the grave;
4030,THE MOTHER.,"She smiled with wasted form, but spirit firm,"
4031,THE MOTHER.,"And said, ""She left but little for the worm:"""
4032,THE MOTHER.,"As toll'd the bell, ""There's one,"" she said, ""hath press'd"
4033,THE MOTHER.,"Awhile before me to the bed of rest:"""
4034,THE MOTHER.,And she beside her with attention spread
4035,THE MOTHER.,The decorations of the maiden dead.
4036,THE MOTHER.,"While quickly thus the mortal part declin'd,"
4037,THE MOTHER.,The happiest visions fill'd the active mind;
4038,THE MOTHER.,"A soft, religious melancholy gain'd"
4039,THE MOTHER.,"Entire possession, and for ever reign'd:"
4040,THE MOTHER.,"On Holy Writ her mind reposing dwelt,"
4041,THE MOTHER.,"She saw the wonders, she the mercies felt;"
4042,THE MOTHER.,"Till, in a bless'd and glorious reverie,"
4043,THE MOTHER.,"She seem'd the Saviour as on earth to see,"
4044,THE MOTHER.,"And, fill'd with love divine, th' attending friend to be;"
4045,THE MOTHER.,"Or she who trembling, yet confiding, stole"
4046,THE MOTHER.,"Near to the garment, touch'd it, and was whole;"
4047,THE MOTHER.,"When, such the intenseness of the working thought,"
4048,THE MOTHER.,On her it seem'd the very deed was wrought;
4049,THE MOTHER.,"She the glad patient's fear and rapture found,"
4050,THE MOTHER.,"The holy transport, and the healing wound;"
4051,THE MOTHER.,"This was so fix'd, so grafted in the heart,"
4052,THE MOTHER.,"That she adopted, nay became the part:"
4053,THE MOTHER.,"But one chief scene was present to her sight,"
4054,THE MOTHER.,Her Saviour resting in the tomb by night;
4055,THE MOTHER.,"Her fever rose, and still her wedded mind"
4056,THE MOTHER.,"Was to that scene, that hallow'd cave, confin'd -"
4057,THE MOTHER.,"Where in the shade of death the body laid,"
4058,THE MOTHER.,There watch'd the spirit of the wandering maid;
4059,THE MOTHER.,"Her looks were fix'd, entranced, illumed, serene,"
4060,THE MOTHER.,In the still glory of the midnight scene:
4061,THE MOTHER.,"There at her Saviour's feet, in visions bless'd,"
4062,THE MOTHER.,Th' enraptured maid a sacred joy possess'd;
4063,THE MOTHER.,In patience waiting for the first-born ray
4064,THE MOTHER.,Of that all-glorious and triumphant day:
4065,THE MOTHER.,"To this idea all her soul she gave,"
4066,THE MOTHER.,Her mind reposing by the sacred grave;
4067,THE MOTHER.,"Then sleep would seal the eye, the vision close,"
4068,THE MOTHER.,And steep the solemn thoughts in brief repose.
4069,THE MOTHER.,"Then grew the soul serene, and all its powers"
4070,THE MOTHER.,"Again restored, illumed the dying hours;"
4071,THE MOTHER.,"But reason dwelt where fancy stray'd before,"
4072,THE MOTHER.,And the mind wander'd from its views no more;
4073,THE MOTHER.,"Till death approach'd, when every look express'd"
4074,THE MOTHER.,"A sense of bliss, till every sense had rest."
4075,THE MOTHER.,"The mother lives, and has enough to buy"
4076,THE MOTHER.,The attentive ear and the submissive eye
4077,THE MOTHER.,"Of abject natures--these are daily told,"
4078,THE MOTHER.,How triumph'd beauty in the days of old;
4079,THE MOTHER.,"How, by her window seated, crowds have cast"
4080,THE MOTHER.,"Admiring glances, wondering as they pass'd;"
4081,THE MOTHER.,"How from her carriage as she stepp'd to pray,"
4082,THE MOTHER.,Divided ranks would humbly make her way;
4083,THE MOTHER.,And how each voice in the astonish'd throng
4084,THE MOTHER.,Pronounced her peerless as she moved along.
4085,THE MOTHER.,Her picture then the greedy Dame displays;
4086,THE MOTHER.,"Touch'd by no shame, she now demands its praise;"
4087,THE MOTHER.,"In her tall mirror then she shows a face,"
4088,THE MOTHER.,Still coldly fair with unaffecting grace;
4089,THE MOTHER.,"These she compares:  ""It has the form,"" she cries,"
4090,THE MOTHER.,"""But wants the air, the spirit, and the eyes;"
4091,THE MOTHER.,"This, as a likeness, is correct and true,"
4092,THE MOTHER.,"But there alone the living grace we view."""
4093,THE MOTHER.,"This said, th' applauding voice the Dame requir'd,"
4094,THE MOTHER.,"And, gazing, slowly from the glass retired."

4118,ARABELLA.,
4119,ARABELLA.,"Of a fair town where Doctor Rack was guide,"
4120,ARABELLA.,His only daughter was the boast and pride -
4121,ARABELLA.,"Wise Arabella, yet not wise alone,"
4122,ARABELLA.,She like a bright and polish'd brilliant shone;
4123,ARABELLA.,"Her father own'd her for his prop and stay,"
4124,ARABELLA.,"Able to guide, yet willing to obey;"
4125,ARABELLA.,"Pleased with her learning while discourse could please,"
4126,ARABELLA.,And with her love in languor and disease:
4127,ARABELLA.,"To every mother were her virtues known,"
4128,ARABELLA.,And to their daughters as a pattern shown;
4129,ARABELLA.,"Who in her youth had all that age requires,"
4130,ARABELLA.,And with her prudence all that youth admires:
4131,ARABELLA.,These odious praises made the damsels try
4132,ARABELLA.,"Not to obtain such merits, but deny;"
4133,ARABELLA.,"For, whatsoever wise mammas might say,"
4134,ARABELLA.,"To guide a daughter, this was not the way;"
4135,ARABELLA.,"From such applause disdain and anger rise,"
4136,ARABELLA.,And envy lives where emulation dies.
4137,ARABELLA.,In all his strength contends the noble horse
4138,ARABELLA.,"With one who just precedes him on the course,"
4139,ARABELLA.,"But when the rival flies too far before,"
4140,ARABELLA.,"His spirit fails, and he attempts no more."
4141,ARABELLA.,"This reasoning Maid, above her sex's dread,"
4142,ARABELLA.,"Had dared to read, and dared to say she read;"
4143,ARABELLA.,"Not the last novel, not the new-born play;"
4144,ARABELLA.,Not the mere trash and scandal of the day;
4145,ARABELLA.,But (though her young companions felt the shock)
4146,ARABELLA.,"She studied Berkeley, Bacon, Hobbes and Locke:"
4147,ARABELLA.,"Her mind within the maze of history dwelt,"
4148,ARABELLA.,And of the moral Muse the beauty felt;
4149,ARABELLA.,"The merits of the Roman page she knew,"
4150,ARABELLA.,And could converse with More and Montague:
4151,ARABELLA.,"Thus she became the wonder of the town,"
4152,ARABELLA.,"From that she reap'd, to that she gave renown;"
4153,ARABELLA.,"And strangers coming, all were taught t'admire"
4154,ARABELLA.,"The learned lady, and the lofty spire."
4155,ARABELLA.,Thus fame in public fix'd the Maid where all
4156,ARABELLA.,"Might throw their darts, and see the idol fall:"
4157,ARABELLA.,"A hundred arrows came with vengeance keen,"
4158,ARABELLA.,"From tongues envenom'd, and from arms unseen;"
4159,ARABELLA.,"A thousand eyes were fix'd upon the place,"
4160,ARABELLA.,"That, if she fell, she might not fly disgrace:"
4161,ARABELLA.,"But malice vainly throws the poison'd dart,"
4162,ARABELLA.,Unless our frailty shows the peccant part;
4163,ARABELLA.,And Arabella still preserved her name
4164,ARABELLA.,"Untouch'd, and shone with undisputed fame;"
4165,ARABELLA.,"Her very notice some respect would cause,"
4166,ARABELLA.,And her esteem was honour and applause.
4167,ARABELLA.,"Men she avoided; not in childish fear,"
4168,ARABELLA.,As if she thought some savage foe was near;
4169,ARABELLA.,"Not as a prude, who hides that man should seek,"
4170,ARABELLA.,Or who by silence hints that they should speak;
4171,ARABELLA.,"But with discretion all the sex she view'd,"
4172,ARABELLA.,Ere yet engaged pursuing or pursued;
4173,ARABELLA.,"Ere love had made her to his vices blind,"
4174,ARABELLA.,Or hid the favourite's failings from her mind.
4175,ARABELLA.,"Thus was the picture of the man portray'd,"
4176,ARABELLA.,By merit destined for so rare a maid;
4177,ARABELLA.,"At whose request she might exchange her state,"
4178,ARABELLA.,Or still be happy in a virgin's fate:  -
4179,ARABELLA.,"He must be one with manners like her own,"
4180,ARABELLA.,"His life unquestion'd, his opinions known;"
4181,ARABELLA.,"His stainless virtue must all tests endure,"
4182,ARABELLA.,"His honour spotless, and his bosom pure;"
4183,ARABELLA.,"She no allowance made for sex or times,"
4184,ARABELLA.,Of lax opinion--crimes were ever crimes;
4185,ARABELLA.,"No wretch forsaken must his frailty curse,"
4186,ARABELLA.,No spurious offspring drain his private purse;
4187,ARABELLA.,"He at all times his passions must command,"
4188,ARABELLA.,And yet possess--or be refused her hand.
4189,ARABELLA.,"All this without reserve the maiden told,"
4190,ARABELLA.,And some began to weigh the rector's gold;
4191,ARABELLA.,"To ask what sum a prudent man might gain,"
4192,ARABELLA.,Who had such store of virtues to maintain?
4193,ARABELLA.,"A Doctor Campbell, north of Tweed, came forth,"
4194,ARABELLA.,"Declared his passion, and proclaim'd his worth;"
4195,ARABELLA.,"Not unapproved, for he had much to say"
4196,ARABELLA.,"On every cause, and in a pleasant way;"
4197,ARABELLA.,"Not all his trust was in a pliant tongue,"
4198,ARABELLA.,"His form was good, and ruddy he, and young:"
4199,ARABELLA.,"But though the doctor was a man of parts,"
4200,ARABELLA.,He read not deeply male or female hearts;
4201,ARABELLA.,But judged that all whom he esteem'd as wise
4202,ARABELLA.,"Must think alike, though some assumed disguise;"
4203,ARABELLA.,"That every reasoning Brahmin, Christian, Jew,"
4204,ARABELLA.,Of all religions took their liberal view;
4205,ARABELLA.,"And of her own, no doubt, this learned Maid"
4206,ARABELLA.,"Denied the substance, and the forms obey'd:"
4207,ARABELLA.,"And thus persuaded, he his thoughts express'd"
4208,ARABELLA.,"Of her opinions, and his own profess'd:"
4209,ARABELLA.,"""All states demand this aid, the vulgar need"
4210,ARABELLA.,"Their priests and prayers, their sermons and their creed;"
4211,ARABELLA.,And those of stronger minds should never speak
4212,ARABELLA.,(In his opinion) what might hurt the weak:
4213,ARABELLA.,"A man may smile, but still he should attend"
4214,ARABELLA.,"His hour at church, and be the Church's friend,"
4215,ARABELLA.,"What there he thinks conceal, and what he hears commend."""
4216,ARABELLA.,"Frank was the speech, but heard with high disdain,"
4217,ARABELLA.,Nor had the doctor leave to speak again;
4218,ARABELLA.,"A man who own'd, nay gloried in deceit,"
4219,ARABELLA.,"""He might despise her, but he should not cheat."""
4220,ARABELLA.,The Vicar Holmes appear'd:  he heard it said
4221,ARABELLA.,That ancient men best pleased the prudent maid;
4222,ARABELLA.,"And true it was her ancient friends she loved,"
4223,ARABELLA.,Servants when old she favour'd and approved;
4224,ARABELLA.,"Age in her pious parents she revered,"
4225,ARABELLA.,And neighbours were by length of days endear'd;
4226,ARABELLA.,"But, if her husband too must ancient be,"
4227,ARABELLA.,The good old vicar found it was not he.
4228,ARABELLA.,On Captain Bligh her mind in balance hung -
4229,ARABELLA.,"Though valiant, modest; and reserved, though young:"
4230,ARABELLA.,Against these merits must defects be set -
4231,ARABELLA.,"Though poor, imprudent; and though proud, in debt:"
4232,ARABELLA.,In vain the captain close attention paid;
4233,ARABELLA.,"She found him wanting, whom she fairly weigh'd."
4234,ARABELLA.,"Then came a youth, and all their friends agreed"
4235,ARABELLA.,That Edward Huntly was the man indeed;
4236,ARABELLA.,"Respectful duty he had paid awhile,"
4237,ARABELLA.,"Then ask'd her hand, and had a gracious smile:"
4238,ARABELLA.,"A lover now declared, he led the fair"
4239,ARABELLA.,"To woods and fields, to visits, and to pray'r;"
4240,ARABELLA.,"Then whisper'd softly--""Will you name the day?"""
4241,ARABELLA.,"She softly whisper'd--""If you love me, stay."""
4242,ARABELLA.,"""Oh! try me not beyond my strength,"" he cried:"
4243,ARABELLA.,"""Oh! be not weak,"" the prudent Maid replied;"
4244,ARABELLA.,"""But by some trial your affection prove -"
4245,ARABELLA.,"Respect, and not impatience, argues love:"
4246,ARABELLA.,"And love no more is by impatience known,"
4247,ARABELLA.,Than ocean's depth is by its tempests shown:
4248,ARABELLA.,"He whom a weak and fond impatience sways,"
4249,ARABELLA.,"But for himself with all his fervour prays,"
4250,ARABELLA.,"And not the maid he woos, but his own will obeys;"
4251,ARABELLA.,"And will she love the being who prefers,"
4252,ARABELLA.,"With so much ardour, his desire to hers?"""
4253,ARABELLA.,"Young Edward grieved, but let not grief be seen;"
4254,ARABELLA.,He knew obedience pleased his fancy's queen:
4255,ARABELLA.,"Awhile he waited, and then cried--""Behold!"
4256,ARABELLA.,"The year advancing, be no longer cold!"""
4257,ARABELLA.,"For she had promised--""Let the flowers appear,"
4258,ARABELLA.,"And I will pass with thee the smiling year:"""
4259,ARABELLA.,"Then pressing grew the youth; the more he press'd,"
4260,ARABELLA.,The less inclined the maid to his request:
4261,ARABELLA.,"""Let June arrive.""  Alas! when April came,"
4262,ARABELLA.,"It brought a stranger, and the stranger, shame;"
4263,ARABELLA.,Nor could the Lover from his house persuade
4264,ARABELLA.,A stubborn lass whom he had mournful made;
4265,ARABELLA.,"Angry and weak, by thoughtless vengeance moved,"
4266,ARABELLA.,She told her story to the Fair beloved;
4267,ARABELLA.,"In strongest words th' unwelcome truth was shown,"
4268,ARABELLA.,"To blight his prospects, careless of her own."
4269,ARABELLA.,"Our heroine grieved, but had too firm a heart"
4270,ARABELLA.,"For him to soften, when she swore to part;"
4271,ARABELLA.,"In vain his seeming penitence and pray'r,"
4272,ARABELLA.,"His vows, his tears; she left him in despair:"
4273,ARABELLA.,"His mother fondly laid her grief aside,"
4274,ARABELLA.,And to the reason of the nymph applied:  -
4275,ARABELLA.,"""It well becomes thee, lady, to appear,"
4276,ARABELLA.,"But not to be, in very truth, severe;"
4277,ARABELLA.,"Although the crime be odious in thy sight,"
4278,ARABELLA.,"That daring sex is taught such things to slight,"
4279,ARABELLA.,"His heart is thine, although it once was frail;"
4280,ARABELLA.,"Think of his grief, and let his love prevail!"""
4281,ARABELLA.,"""Plead thou no more, ""the lofty lass return'd;"
4282,ARABELLA.,"""Forgiving woman is deceived and spurn'd:"
4283,ARABELLA.,Say that the crime is common--shall I take
4284,ARABELLA.,A common man my wedded lord to make?
4285,ARABELLA.,"See? a weak woman by his arts betray'd,"
4286,ARABELLA.,An infant born his father to upbraid;
4287,ARABELLA.,"Shall I forgive his vileness, take his name,"
4288,ARABELLA.,"Sanction his error, and partake his shame?"
4289,ARABELLA.,"No! this assent would kindred frailty prove,"
4290,ARABELLA.,A love for him would be a vicious love:
4291,ARABELLA.,Can a chaste maiden secret counsel hold
4292,ARABELLA.,With one whose crime by every mouth is told?
4293,ARABELLA.,"Forbid it spirit, prudence, virtuous pride;"
4294,ARABELLA.,"He must despise me, were he not denied:"
4295,ARABELLA.,The way from vice the erring mind to win
4296,ARABELLA.,"Is with presuming sinners to begin,"
4297,ARABELLA.,"And show, by scorning them, a just contempt for sin."""
4298,ARABELLA.,"The youth, repulsed, to one more mild convey'd"
4299,ARABELLA.,"His heart, and smiled on the remorseless maid;"
4300,ARABELLA.,"The maid, remorseless, in her pride, the while"
4301,ARABELLA.,"Despised the insult, and return'd the smile."
4302,ARABELLA.,"First to admire, to praise her, and defend,"
4303,ARABELLA.,Was (now in years advanced) a virgin-friend:
4304,ARABELLA.,"Much she preferr'd, she cried the single state,"
4305,ARABELLA.,"""It was her choice""--it surely was her fate;"
4306,ARABELLA.,And much it pleased her in the train to view
4307,ARABELLA.,"A maiden vot'ress, wise and lovely too."
4308,ARABELLA.,"Time to the yielding mind his change imparts,"
4309,ARABELLA.,"He varies notions, and he alters hearts;"
4310,ARABELLA.,"'Tis right, 'tis just to feel contempt for vice,"
4311,ARABELLA.,But he that shows it may be over-nice:
4312,ARABELLA.,"There are who feel, when young, the false sublime,"
4313,ARABELLA.,And proudly love to show disdain for crime;
4314,ARABELLA.,"To whom the future will new thoughts supply,"
4315,ARABELLA.,"The pride will soften, and the scorn will die;"
4316,ARABELLA.,"Nay, where they still the vice itself condemn,"
4317,ARABELLA.,"They bear the vicious, and consort with them:"
4318,ARABELLA.,"Young Captain Grove, when one had changed his side,"
4319,ARABELLA.,"Despised the venal turncoat, and defied;"
4320,ARABELLA.,"Old Colonel Grove now shakes him by the hand,"
4321,ARABELLA.,Though he who bribes may still his vote command.
4322,ARABELLA.,"Why would not Ellen to Belinda speak,"
4323,ARABELLA.,"When she had flown to London for a week,"
4324,ARABELLA.,"And then return'd, to every friend's surprise,"
4325,ARABELLA.,"With twice the spirit, and with half the size?"
4326,ARABELLA.,"She spoke not then--but, after years had flown,"
4327,ARABELLA.,A better friend had Ellen never known:
4328,ARABELLA.,Was it the lady her mistake had seen?
4329,ARABELLA.,Or had she too on such a journey been?
4330,ARABELLA.,"No:  'twas the gradual change in human hearts,"
4331,ARABELLA.,"That time, in commerce with the world, imparts;"
4332,ARABELLA.,"That on the roughest temper throws disguise,"
4333,ARABELLA.,And steals from virtue her asperities.
4334,ARABELLA.,"The young and ardent, who with glowing zeal"
4335,ARABELLA.,"Felt wrath for trifles, and were proud to feel,"
4336,ARABELLA.,"Now find those trifles all the mind engage,"
4337,ARABELLA.,"To soothe dull hours, and cheat the cares of age;"
4338,ARABELLA.,"As young Zelinda, in her quaker-dress,"
4339,ARABELLA.,"Disdain'd each varying fashion's vile excess,"
4340,ARABELLA.,"And now her friends on old Zelinda gaze,"
4341,ARABELLA.,Pleased in rich silks and orient gems to blaze:
4342,ARABELLA.,"Changes like these 'tis folly to condemn,"
4343,ARABELLA.,"So virtue yields not, nor is changed with them."
4344,ARABELLA.,"Let us proceed: --Twelve brilliant years were past,"
4345,ARABELLA.,Yet each with less of glory than the last.
4346,ARABELLA.,Whether these years to this fair virgin gave
4347,ARABELLA.,A softer mind--effect they often have;
4348,ARABELLA.,Whether the virgin-state was not so bless'd
4349,ARABELLA.,As that good maiden in her zeal profess'd;
4350,ARABELLA.,"Or whether lovers falling from her train,"
4351,ARABELLA.,"Gave greater price to those she could retain,"
4352,ARABELLA.,Is all unknown;--but Arabella now
4353,ARABELLA.,"Was kindly listening to a Merchant's vow,"
4354,ARABELLA.,"Who offer'd terms so fair, against his love"
4355,ARABELLA.,"To strive was folly, so she never strove. -"
4356,ARABELLA.,Man in his earlier days we often find
4357,ARABELLA.,With a too easy and unguarded mind;
4358,ARABELLA.,"But by increasing years and prudence taught,"
4359,ARABELLA.,"He grows reserved, and locks up every thought:"
4360,ARABELLA.,"Not thus the maiden, for in blooming youth"
4361,ARABELLA.,She hides her thought and guards the tender truth:
4362,ARABELLA.,"This, when no longer young, no more she hides,"
4363,ARABELLA.,But frankly in the favour'd swain confides:
4364,ARABELLA.,"Man, stubborn man, is like the growing tree,"
4365,ARABELLA.,"That, longer standing, still will harder be;"
4366,ARABELLA.,"And like its fruit, the virgin, first austere,"
4367,ARABELLA.,Then kindly softening with the ripening year.
4368,ARABELLA.,"Now was the lover urgent, and the kind"
4369,ARABELLA.,And yielding lady to his suit inclined:
4370,ARABELLA.,"""A little time, my friend, is just, is right;"
4371,ARABELLA.,"We must be decent in our neighbours' sight:"""
4372,ARABELLA.,"Still she allow'd him of his hopes to speak,"
4373,ARABELLA.,And in compassion took off week by week;
4374,ARABELLA.,"Till few remain'd, when, wearied with delay,"
4375,ARABELLA.,She kindly meant to take off day by day.
4376,ARABELLA.,That female Friend who gave our virgin praise
4377,ARABELLA.,"For flying man and all his treacherous ways,"
4378,ARABELLA.,"Now heard with mingled anger, shame, and fear"
4379,ARABELLA.,"Of one accepted, and a wedding near;"
4380,ARABELLA.,But she resolved again with friendly zeal
4381,ARABELLA.,To make the maid her scorn of wedlock feel;
4382,ARABELLA.,"For she was grieved to find her work undone,"
4383,ARABELLA.,And like a sister mourn'd the failing nun.
4384,ARABELLA.,Why are these gentle maidens prone to make
4385,ARABELLA.,Their sister-doves the tempting world forsake?
4386,ARABELLA.,Why all their triumph when a maid disdains
4387,ARABELLA.,"The tyrant sex, aud scorns to wear its chains?"
4388,ARABELLA.,Is it pure joy to see a sister flown
4389,ARABELLA.,From the false pleasures they themselves have known:
4390,ARABELLA.,"Or do they, as the call-birds in the cage,"
4391,ARABELLA.,"Try, in pure envy, others to engage?"
4392,ARABELLA.,"And therefore paint their native woods and groves,"
4393,ARABELLA.,As scenes of dangerous joys and naughty loves?
4394,ARABELLA.,"Strong was the maiden's hope; her friend was proud,"
4395,ARABELLA.,And had her notions to the world avow'd;
4396,ARABELLA.,"And, could she find the Merchant weak and frail,"
4397,ARABELLA.,"With power to prove it, then she must prevail:"
4398,ARABELLA.,"For she aloud would publish his disgrace,"
4399,ARABELLA.,And save his victim from a man so base.
4400,ARABELLA.,"When all inquiries had been duly made,"
4401,ARABELLA.,Came the kind Friend her burthen to unlade:  -
4402,ARABELLA.,"""Alas! my dear! not all our care and art"
4403,ARABELLA.,Can thread the maze of man's deceitful heart;
4404,ARABELLA.,Look not surprised--nor let resentment swell
4405,ARABELLA.,"Those lovely features, all will yet be well;"
4406,ARABELLA.,"And thou, from love's and man's deceptions free,"
4407,ARABELLA.,"Wilt dwell in virgin-state, and walk to Heaven with me."""
4408,ARABELLA.,"The Maiden frown'd, and then conceived ""that wives"
4409,ARABELLA.,"Could walk as well, and lead as holy lives,"
4410,ARABELLA.,"As angry prudes who scorn'd the marriage-chain,"
4411,ARABELLA.,"Or luckless maids, who sought it still in vain."""
4412,ARABELLA.,"The Friend was vex'd--she paused; at length she cried,"
4413,ARABELLA.,"""Know your own danger, then your lot decide:"
4414,ARABELLA.,"That traitor Beswell, while he seeks your hand,"
4415,ARABELLA.,"Has, I affirm, a wanton at command;"
4416,ARABELLA.,"A slave, a creature from a foreign place,"
4417,ARABELLA.,The nurse and mother of a spurious race;
4418,ARABELLA.,"Brown ugly bastards (Heaven the word forgive,"
4419,ARABELLA.,And the deed punish!) in his cottage live;
4420,ARABELLA.,"To town if business calls him, there he stays"
4421,ARABELLA.,In sinful pleasures wasting countless days.
4422,ARABELLA.,"Nor doubt the facts, for I can witness call,"
4423,ARABELLA.,"For every crime, and prove them one and all."""
4424,ARABELLA.,Here ceased th' informer; Arabella's look
4425,ARABELLA.,Was like a schoolboy's puzzled by his book;
4426,ARABELLA.,"Intent she cast her eyes upon the floor,"
4427,ARABELLA.,Paused--then replied -
4428,ARABELLA.,"""I wish to know no more:"
4429,ARABELLA.,"I question not your motive, zeal, or love,"
4430,ARABELLA.,But must decline such dubious points to prove.
4431,ARABELLA.,"All is not true, I judge, for who can guess"
4432,ARABELLA.,Those deeds of darkness men with care suppress?
4433,ARABELLA.,"He brought a slave perhaps to England's coast,"
4434,ARABELLA.,And made her free; it is our country's boast!
4435,ARABELLA.,And she perchance too grateful--good and ill
4436,ARABELLA.,"Were sown at first, and grow together still;"
4437,ARABELLA.,"The colour'd infants on the village green,"
4438,ARABELLA.,What are they more than we have often seen?
4439,ARABELLA.,"Children half-clothed who round their village stray,"
4440,ARABELLA.,"In sun or rain, now starved, now beaten, they"
4441,ARABELLA.,Will the dark colour of their fate betray:
4442,ARABELLA.,"Let us in Christian love for all account,"
4443,ARABELLA.,"And then behold to what such tales amount."""
4444,ARABELLA.,"""His heart is evil,"" said the impatient Friend:"
4445,ARABELLA.,"""My duty bids me try that heart to mend,"""
4446,ARABELLA.,"Replied the virgin; ""we may be too nice"
4447,ARABELLA.,And lose a soul in our contempt of vice;
4448,ARABELLA.,"If false the charge, I then shall show regard"
4449,ARABELLA.,"For a good man, and be his just reward:"
4450,ARABELLA.,And what for virtue can I better do
4451,ARABELLA.,"Than to reclaim him, if the charge be true?"""
4452,ARABELLA.,"She spoke, nor more her holy work delay'd;"
4453,ARABELLA.,'Twas time to lend an erring mortal aid:
4454,ARABELLA.,"""The noblest way,"" she judged, ""a soul to win,"

4912,EDWARD SHORE.,"Boast of these friends, to older men a guide,"
4913,EDWARD SHORE.,"Proud of his parts, but gracious in his pride;"
4914,EDWARD SHORE.,"He bore a gay good-nature in his face,"

4916,EDWARD SHORE.,"Dress that became his state and years he wore,"
4917,EDWARD SHORE.,And sense and spirit shone in Edward Shore.
4918,EDWARD SHORE.,"Thus, while admiring friends the Youth beheld,"
4919,EDWARD SHORE.,His own disgust their forward hopes repell'd;
4920,EDWARD SHORE.,"For he unfix'd, unfixing, look'd around,"
4921,EDWARD SHORE.,And no employment but in seeking found;
4922,EDWARD SHORE.,"He gave his restless thoughts to views refined,"
4923,EDWARD SHORE.,And shrank from worldly cares with wounded mind.

4926,EDWARD SHORE.,"A doubting, dismal tribe physicians seem'd;"

4956,EDWARD SHORE.,"Thus look'd he proudly on the vulgar crew,"
4957,EDWARD SHORE.,"Whom statutes govern, and whom fears subdue."
4958,EDWARD SHORE.,"Faith, with his virtue, he indeed profess'd,"
4959,EDWARD SHORE.,But doubts deprived his ardent mind of rest;
4960,EDWARD SHORE.,"Reason, his sovereign mistress, fail'd to show"
4961,EDWARD SHORE.,Light through the mazes of the world below:
4962,EDWARD SHORE.,"Questions arose, and they surpass'd the skill"
4963,EDWARD SHORE.,"Of his sole aid, and would be dubious still;"
4964,EDWARD SHORE.,"These to discuss he sought no common guide,"
4965,EDWARD SHORE.,But to the doubters in his doubts applied;
4966,EDWARD SHORE.,"When all together might in freedom speak,"
4967,EDWARD SHORE.,And their loved truth with mutual ardour seek.
4968,EDWARD SHORE.,Alas! though men who feel their eyes decay
4969,EDWARD SHORE.,"Take more than common pains to find their way,"
4970,EDWARD SHORE.,"Yet, when for this they ask each other's aid,"
4971,EDWARD SHORE.,Their mutual purpose is the more delay'd:
4972,EDWARD SHORE.,"Of all their doubts, their reasoning clear'd not one,"
4973,EDWARD SHORE.,Still the same spots were present in the sun:
4974,EDWARD SHORE.,"Still the same scruples haunted Edward's mind,"
4975,EDWARD SHORE.,"Who found no rest, nor took the means to find."
4976,EDWARD SHORE.,"But though with shaken faith, and slave to fame,"
4977,EDWARD SHORE.,"Vain and aspiring on the world he came,"
4978,EDWARD SHORE.,"Yet was he studious, serious, moral, grave,"
4979,EDWARD SHORE.,"No passion's victim, and no system's slave:"
4980,EDWARD SHORE.,"Vice he opposed, indulgence he disdain'd,"
4981,EDWARD SHORE.,And o'er each sense in conscious triumph reign'd.
4982,EDWARD SHORE.,"Who often reads will sometimes wish to write,"
4983,EDWARD SHORE.,And Shore would yield instruction and delight:
4984,EDWARD SHORE.,"A serious drama he design'd, but found"
4985,EDWARD SHORE.,'Twas tedious travelling in that gloomy ground;
4986,EDWARD SHORE.,"A deep and solemn story he would try,"
4987,EDWARD SHORE.,"But grew ashamed of ghosts, and laid it by;"
4988,EDWARD SHORE.,"Sermons he wrote, but they who knew his creed,"
4989,EDWARD SHORE.,"Or knew it not, were ill-disposed to read;"
4990,EDWARD SHORE.,"And he would lastly be the nation's guide,"
4991,EDWARD SHORE.,"But, studying, fail'd to fix upon a side;"
4992,EDWARD SHORE.,"Fame he desired, and talents he possess'd,"
4993,EDWARD SHORE.,"But loved not labour, though he could not rest,"
4994,EDWARD SHORE.,"Nor firmly fix the vacillating mind,"
4995,EDWARD SHORE.,"That, ever working, could no centre find."
4996,EDWARD SHORE.,'Tis thus a sanguine reader loves to trace
4997,EDWARD SHORE.,The Nile forth rushing on his glorious race;
4998,EDWARD SHORE.,Calm and secure the fancied traveller goes
4999,EDWARD SHORE.,Through sterile deserts and by threat'ning foes;
5000,EDWARD SHORE.,"He thinks not then of Afric's scorching sands,"
5001,EDWARD SHORE.,"Th' Arabian sea, the Abyssinian bands;"
5002,EDWARD SHORE.,"Fasils and Michaels, and the robbers all, {4}"
5003,EDWARD SHORE.,Whom we politely chiefs and heroes call:
5004,EDWARD SHORE.,"He of success alone delights to think,"
5005,EDWARD SHORE.,"He views that fount, he stands upon the brink,"
5006,EDWARD SHORE.,"And drinks a fancied draught, exulting so to drink."
5007,EDWARD SHORE.,"In his own room, and with his books around,"
5008,EDWARD SHORE.,His lively mind its chief employment found;
5009,EDWARD SHORE.,"Then idly busy, quietly employ'd,"
5010,EDWARD SHORE.,"And, lost to life, his visions were enjoy'd:"
5011,EDWARD SHORE.,Yet still he took a keen inquiring view
5012,EDWARD SHORE.,"Of all that crowds neglect, desire, pursue;"
5013,EDWARD SHORE.,"And thus abstracted, curious, still, serene,"
5014,EDWARD SHORE.,"He, unemploy'd, beheld life's shifting scene:"
5015,EDWARD SHORE.,"Still more averse from vulgar joys and cares,"
5016,EDWARD SHORE.,Still more unfitted for the world's affairs.
5017,EDWARD SHORE.,"There was a house where Edward ofttimes went,"
5018,EDWARD SHORE.,And social hours in pleasant trifling spent;
5019,EDWARD SHORE.,"He read, conversed, and reason'd, sang and play'd,"
5020,EDWARD SHORE.,And all were happy while the idler stay'd;
5021,EDWARD SHORE.,"Too happy one! for thence arose the pain,"
5022,EDWARD SHORE.,Till this engaging trifler came again.
5023,EDWARD SHORE.,"But did he love? We answer, day by day,"
5024,EDWARD SHORE.,"The loving feet would take th' accustom'd way,"
5025,EDWARD SHORE.,The amorous eye would rove as if in quest
5026,EDWARD SHORE.,"Of something rare, and on the mansion rest;"
5027,EDWARD SHORE.,"The same soft passion touch'd the gentle tongue,"
5028,EDWARD SHORE.,And Anna's charms in tender notes were sung;
5029,EDWARD SHORE.,"The ear, too, seem'd to feel the common flame,"
5030,EDWARD SHORE.,Soothed and delighted with the fair one's name;
5031,EDWARD SHORE.,"And thus, as love each other part possess'd,"
5032,EDWARD SHORE.,"The heart, no doubt, its sovereign power confess'd."
5033,EDWARD SHORE.,"Pleased in her sight, the Youth required no more;"
5034,EDWARD SHORE.,"Not rich himself, he saw the damsel poor;"
5035,EDWARD SHORE.,"And he too wisely, nay, too kindly loved,"
5036,EDWARD SHORE.,To pain the being whom his soul approved.
5037,EDWARD SHORE.,"A serious Friend our cautious Youth possess'd,"
5038,EDWARD SHORE.,And at his table sat a welcome guest;
5039,EDWARD SHORE.,"Both unemploy'd, it was their chief delight"
5040,EDWARD SHORE.,To read what free and daring authors write;
5041,EDWARD SHORE.,"Authors who loved from common views to soar,"
5042,EDWARD SHORE.,And seek the fountains never traced before:
5043,EDWARD SHORE.,"Truth they profess'd, yet often left the true"
5044,EDWARD SHORE.,"And beaten prospect, for the wild and new."
5045,EDWARD SHORE.,"His chosen friend his fiftieth year had seen,"
5046,EDWARD SHORE.,"His fortune easy, and his air serene;"
5047,EDWARD SHORE.,Deist and atheist call'd; for few agreed
5048,EDWARD SHORE.,"What were his notions, principles, or creed;"
5049,EDWARD SHORE.,"His mind reposed not, for he hated rest,"
5050,EDWARD SHORE.,But all things made a query or a jest;
5051,EDWARD SHORE.,"Perplex'd himself, he ever sought to prove"
5052,EDWARD SHORE.,That man is doom'd in endless doubt to rove;
5053,EDWARD SHORE.,"Himself in darkness he profess'd to be,"
5054,EDWARD SHORE.,And would maintain that not a man could see.
5055,EDWARD SHORE.,"The youthful Friend, dissentient, reason'd still"
5056,EDWARD SHORE.,"Of the soul's prowess, and the subject-will;"
5057,EDWARD SHORE.,"Of virtue's beauty, and of honour's force,"
5058,EDWARD SHORE.,And a warm zeal gave life to his discourse:
5059,EDWARD SHORE.,"Since from his feelings all his fire arose,"
5060,EDWARD SHORE.,And he had interest in the themes he chose.
5061,EDWARD SHORE.,"The Friend, indulging a sarcastic smile,"
5062,EDWARD SHORE.,"Said, ""Dear enthusiast! thou wilt change thy style,"
5063,EDWARD SHORE.,"When man's delusions, errors, crimes, deceit,"
5064,EDWARD SHORE.,"No more distress thee, and no longer cheat."""
5065,EDWARD SHORE.,"Yet, lo! this cautious man, so coolly wise,"
5066,EDWARD SHORE.,On a young Beauty fix'd unguarded eyes;
5067,EDWARD SHORE.,And her he married:  Edward at the view
5068,EDWARD SHORE.,Bade to his cheerful visits long adieu;
5069,EDWARD SHORE.,"But haply err'd, for this engaging bride"
5070,EDWARD SHORE.,"No mirth suppress'd, but rather cause supplied:"
5071,EDWARD SHORE.,"And when she saw the friends, by reasoning long,"
5072,EDWARD SHORE.,"Confused if right, and positive if wrong,"
5073,EDWARD SHORE.,"With playful speech, and smile that spoke delight,"
5074,EDWARD SHORE.,She made them careless both of wrong and right.
5075,EDWARD SHORE.,"This gentle damsel gave consent to wed,"
5076,EDWARD SHORE.,With school and school-day dinners in her head:
5077,EDWARD SHORE.,"She now was promised choice of daintiest food,"
5078,EDWARD SHORE.,"And costly dress, that made her sovereign good;"
5079,EDWARD SHORE.,"With walks on hilly heath to banish spleen,"
5080,EDWARD SHORE.,And summer-visits when the roads were clean.
5081,EDWARD SHORE.,"All these she loved, to these she gave consent,"
5082,EDWARD SHORE.,And she was married to her heart's content.
5083,EDWARD SHORE.,"Their manner this--the Friends together read,"
5084,EDWARD SHORE.,Till books a cause for disputation bred;
5085,EDWARD SHORE.,"Debate then follow'd, and the vapour'd child"
5086,EDWARD SHORE.,Declared they argued till her head was wild;
5087,EDWARD SHORE.,And strange to her it was that mortal brain
5088,EDWARD SHORE.,"Could seek the trial, or endure the pain."
5089,EDWARD SHORE.,"Then, as the Friend reposed, the younger pair"
5090,EDWARD SHORE.,"Sat down to cards, and play'd beside his chair;"
5091,EDWARD SHORE.,"Till he, awaking, to his books applied,"
5092,EDWARD SHORE.,Or heard the music of th' obedient bride:
5093,EDWARD SHORE.,"If mild the evening, in the fields they stray'd,"
5094,EDWARD SHORE.,And their own flock with partial eye survey'd;
5095,EDWARD SHORE.,"But oft the husband, to indulgence prone,"
5096,EDWARD SHORE.,"Resumed his book, and bade them walk alone."
5097,EDWARD SHORE.,"""Do, my kind Edward--I must take mine ease -"
5098,EDWARD SHORE.,Name the dear girl the planets and the trees:
5099,EDWARD SHORE.,"Tell her what warblers pour their evening song,"
5100,EDWARD SHORE.,"What insects flutter, as you walk along;"
5101,EDWARD SHORE.,"Teach her to fix the roving thoughts, to bind"
5102,EDWARD SHORE.,"The wandering sense, and methodize the mind."""
5103,EDWARD SHORE.,"This was obey'd; and oft when this was done,"
5104,EDWARD SHORE.,They calmly gazed on the declining sun;
5105,EDWARD SHORE.,"In silence saw the glowing landscape fade,"
5106,EDWARD SHORE.,"Or, sitting, sang beneath the arbour's shade:"
5107,EDWARD SHORE.,"Till rose the moon, and on each youthful face"
5108,EDWARD SHORE.,Shed a soft beauty and a dangerous grace.
5109,EDWARD SHORE.,When the young Wife beheld in long debate
5110,EDWARD SHORE.,"Tho friends, all careless as she seeming sate,"
5111,EDWARD SHORE.,It soon appear'd there was in one combined
5112,EDWARD SHORE.,The nobler person and the richer mind:
5113,EDWARD SHORE.,"He wore no wig, no grisly beard was seen,"
5114,EDWARD SHORE.,"And none beheld him careless or unclean,"
5115,EDWARD SHORE.,Or watch'd him sleeping.  We indeed have heard
5116,EDWARD SHORE.,"Of sleeping beauty, and it has appear'd;"
5117,EDWARD SHORE.,'Tis seen in infants--there indeed we find
5118,EDWARD SHORE.,The features soften'd by the slumbering mind;
5119,EDWARD SHORE.,"But other beauties, when disposed to sleep,"
5120,EDWARD SHORE.,Should from the eye of keen inspector keep:
5121,EDWARD SHORE.,"The lovely nymph who would her swain surprise,"
5122,EDWARD SHORE.,"May close her mouth, but not conceal her eyes;"
5123,EDWARD SHORE.,"Sleep from the fairest face some beauty takes,"
5124,EDWARD SHORE.,And all the homely features homelier makes:
5125,EDWARD SHORE.,"So thought our wife, beholding with a sigh"
5126,EDWARD SHORE.,"Her sleeping spouse, and Edward smiling by."
5127,EDWARD SHORE.,A sick relation for the husband sent;
5128,EDWARD SHORE.,Without delay the friendly sceptic went;
5129,EDWARD SHORE.,"Nor fear'd the youthful pair, for he had seen"
5130,EDWARD SHORE.,"The wife untroubled, and the friend serene;"
5131,EDWARD SHORE.,"No selfish purpose in his roving eyes,"
5132,EDWARD SHORE.,No vile deception in her fond replies:
5133,EDWARD SHORE.,"So judged the husband, and with judgment true,"
5134,EDWARD SHORE.,For neither yet the guilt or danger knew.
5135,EDWARD SHORE.,What now remain'd? but they again should play
5136,EDWARD SHORE.,"Th' accustom'd game, and walk th' accustom'd way;"
5137,EDWARD SHORE.,"With careless freedom should converse or read,"
5138,EDWARD SHORE.,And the Friend's absence neither fear nor heed:
5139,EDWARD SHORE.,"But rather now they seem'd confused, constrain'd;"
5140,EDWARD SHORE.,"Within their room still restless they remain'd,"
5141,EDWARD SHORE.,"And painfully they felt, and knew each other pain'd."
5142,EDWARD SHORE.,"Ah, foolish men! how could ye thus depend,"
5143,EDWARD SHORE.,"One on himself, the other on his friend?"
5144,EDWARD SHORE.,"The Youth with troubled eye the lady saw,"
5145,EDWARD SHORE.,"Yet felt too brave, too daring to withdraw;"
5146,EDWARD SHORE.,"While she, with tuneless hand the jarring keys"
5147,EDWARD SHORE.,"Touching, was not one moment at her ease:"
5148,EDWARD SHORE.,"Now would she walk, and call her friendly guide,"
5149,EDWARD SHORE.,"Now speak of rain, and cast her cloak aside;"
5150,EDWARD SHORE.,"Seize on a book, unconscious what she read,"
5151,EDWARD SHORE.,And restless still to new resources fled;
5152,EDWARD SHORE.,"Then laugh'd aloud, then tried to look serene;"
5153,EDWARD SHORE.,"And ever changed, and every change was seen."
5154,EDWARD SHORE.,Painful it is to dwell on deeds of shame -
5155,EDWARD SHORE.,"The trying day was past, another came;"
5156,EDWARD SHORE.,"The third was all remorse, confusion, dread,"
5157,EDWARD SHORE.,And (all too late!) the fallen hero fled.
5158,EDWARD SHORE.,"Then felt the Youth, in that seducing time,"
5159,EDWARD SHORE.,How feebly Honour guards the heart from crime:
5160,EDWARD SHORE.,"Small is his native strength; man needs the stay,"
5161,EDWARD SHORE.,The strength imparted in the trying day;
5162,EDWARD SHORE.,For all that Honour brings against the force
5163,EDWARD SHORE.,"Of headlong passion, aids its rapid course;"
5164,EDWARD SHORE.,"Its slight resistance but provokes the fire,"
5165,EDWARD SHORE.,"As wood-work stops the flame, and then conveys it higher."
5166,EDWARD SHORE.,The Husband came; a wife by guilt made bold
5167,EDWARD SHORE.,"Had, meeting, soothed him, as in days of old;"
5168,EDWARD SHORE.,"But soon this fact transpired; her strong distress,"
5169,EDWARD SHORE.,"And his Friend's absence, left him nought to guess."
5170,EDWARD SHORE.,"Still cool, though grieved, thus prudence bade him write -"
5171,EDWARD SHORE.,"""I cannot pardon, and I will not fight;"
5172,EDWARD SHORE.,"Thou art too poor a culprit for the laws,"
5173,EDWARD SHORE.,And I too faulty to support my cause:
5174,EDWARD SHORE.,"All must be punish'd; I must sigh alone,"
5175,EDWARD SHORE.,At home thy victim for her guilt atone;
5176,EDWARD SHORE.,"And thou, unhappy! virtuous now no more,"
5177,EDWARD SHORE.,"Must loss of fame, peace, purity deplore;"
5178,EDWARD SHORE.,"Sinners with praise will pierce thee to the heart,"
5179,EDWARD SHORE.,"And saints, deriding, tell thee what thou art."""
5180,EDWARD SHORE.,"Such was his fall; and Edward, from that time,"
5181,EDWARD SHORE.,Felt in full force the censure and the crime -
5182,EDWARD SHORE.,"Despised, ashamed; his noble views before,"
5183,EDWARD SHORE.,"And his proud thoughts, degraded him the more:"
5184,EDWARD SHORE.,Should he repent--would that conceal his shame?
5185,EDWARD SHORE.,Could peace be his? It perish'd with his fame:
5186,EDWARD SHORE.,"Himself he scorn'd, nor could his crime forgive;"
5187,EDWARD SHORE.,"He fear'd to die, yet felt ashamed to live:"
5188,EDWARD SHORE.,"Grieved, but not contrite, was his heart; oppress'd,"
5189,EDWARD SHORE.,"Not broken; not converted, but distress'd;"
5190,EDWARD SHORE.,"He wanted will to bend the stubborn knee,"
5191,EDWARD SHORE.,"He wanted light the cause of ill to see,"
5192,EDWARD SHORE.,"To learn how frail is man, how humble then should be;"
5193,EDWARD SHORE.,"For faith he had not, or a faith too weak"
5194,EDWARD SHORE.,To gain the help that humble sinners seek;
5195,EDWARD SHORE.,Else had he pray'd--to an offended God
5196,EDWARD SHORE.,His tears had flown a penitential flood;
5197,EDWARD SHORE.,"Though far astray, he would have heard the call"
5198,EDWARD SHORE.,"Of mercy--""Come! return, thou prodigal:"""
5199,EDWARD SHORE.,"Then, though confused, distress'd, ashamed, afraid,"
5200,EDWARD SHORE.,Still had the trembling penitent obey'd;
5201,EDWARD SHORE.,"Though faith had fainted, when assail'd by fear,"
5202,EDWARD SHORE.,"Hope to the soul had whisper'd, ""Persevere!"""
5203,EDWARD SHORE.,"Till in his Father's house, an humbled guest,"
5204,EDWARD SHORE.,"He would have found forgiveness, comfort, rest."
5205,EDWARD SHORE.,But all this joy was to our Youth denied
5206,EDWARD SHORE.,By his fierce passions and his daring pride;
5207,EDWARD SHORE.,"And shame and doubt impell'd him in a course,"
5208,EDWARD SHORE.,"Once so abhorr'd, with unresisted force,"
5209,EDWARD SHORE.,"Proud minds and guilty, whom their crimes oppress,"
5210,EDWARD SHORE.,Fly to new crimes for comfort and redress;
5211,EDWARD SHORE.,So found our fallen Youth a short relief
5212,EDWARD SHORE.,"In wine, the opiate guilt applies to grief, -"
5213,EDWARD SHORE.,"From fleeting mirth that o'er the bottle lives,"
5214,EDWARD SHORE.,"From the false joy its inspiration gives, -"
5215,EDWARD SHORE.,And from associates pleased to find a friend
5216,EDWARD SHORE.,"With powers to lead them, gladden, and defend,"
5217,EDWARD SHORE.,"In all those scenes where transient ease is found,"
5218,EDWARD SHORE.,For minds whom sins oppress and sorrows wound.
5219,EDWARD SHORE.,"Wine is like anger; for it makes us strong,"
5220,EDWARD SHORE.,"Blind, and impatient, and it leads us wrong;"
5221,EDWARD SHORE.,"The strength is quickly lost, we feel the error long:"
5222,EDWARD SHORE.,"Thus led, thus strengthen'd, in an evil cause,"
5223,EDWARD SHORE.,"For folly pleading, sought the Youth applause;"
5224,EDWARD SHORE.,"Sad for a time, then eloquently wild,"
5225,EDWARD SHORE.,He gaily spoke as his companions smiled;
5226,EDWARD SHORE.,"Lightly he rose, and with his former grace"
5227,EDWARD SHORE.,"Proposed some doubt, and argued on the case;"
5228,EDWARD SHORE.,Fate and foreknowledge were his favourite themes -
5229,EDWARD SHORE.,"How vain man's purpose, how absurd his schemes:"
5230,EDWARD SHORE.,"""Whatever is, was ere our birth decreed;"
5231,EDWARD SHORE.,"We think our actions from ourselves proceed,"
5232,EDWARD SHORE.,And idly we lament th' inevitable deed;
5233,EDWARD SHORE.,"It seems our own, but there's a power above"
5234,EDWARD SHORE.,"Directs the motion, nay, that makes us move;"
5235,EDWARD SHORE.,"Nor good nor evil can you beings name,"
5236,EDWARD SHORE.,Who are but rooks and castles in the game;
5237,EDWARD SHORE.,"Superior natures with their puppets play,"
5238,EDWARD SHORE.,"Till, bagg'd or buried, all are swept away."""
5239,EDWARD SHORE.,Such were the notions of a mind to ill
5240,EDWARD SHORE.,"Now prone, but ardent and determined still:"
5241,EDWARD SHORE.,"Of joy now eager, as before of fame,"
5242,EDWARD SHORE.,"And screen'd by folly when assail'd by shame,"
5243,EDWARD SHORE.,"Deeply he sank; obey'd each passion's call,"
5244,EDWARD SHORE.,And used his reason to defend them all.
5245,EDWARD SHORE.,"Shall I proceed, and step by step relate"
5246,EDWARD SHORE.,The odious progress of a Sinner's fate?
5247,EDWARD SHORE.,No--let me rather hasten to the time
5248,EDWARD SHORE.,(Sure to arrive!) when misery waits on crime.
5249,EDWARD SHORE.,"With Virtue, prudence fled; what Shore possessed"
5250,EDWARD SHORE.,"Was sold, was spent, and he was now distressed:"
5251,EDWARD SHORE.,"And Want, unwelcome stranger, pale and wan,"
5252,EDWARD SHORE.,Met with her haggard looks the hurried man:
5253,EDWARD SHORE.,His pride felt keenly what he must expect
5254,EDWARD SHORE.,From useless pity and from cold neglect.
5255,EDWARD SHORE.,"Struck by new terrors, from his friends he fled,"
5256,EDWARD SHORE.,And wept his woes upon a restless bed;
5257,EDWARD SHORE.,"Retiring late, at early hour to rise,"
5258,EDWARD SHORE.,"With shrunken features, and with bloodshot eyes:"
5259,EDWARD SHORE.,"If sleep one moment closed the dismal view,"
5260,EDWARD SHORE.,Fancy her terrors built upon the true:
5261,EDWARD SHORE.,"And night and day had their alternate woes,"
5262,EDWARD SHORE.,"That baffled pleasure, and that mock'd repose;"
5263,EDWARD SHORE.,Till to despair and anguish was consign'd
5264,EDWARD SHORE.,The wreck and ruin of a noble mind.
5265,EDWARD SHORE.,"Now seized for debt, and lodged within a jail,"
5266,EDWARD SHORE.,"He tried his friendships, and he found them fail;"
5267,EDWARD SHORE.,"Then fail'd his spirits, and his thoughts were all"
5268,EDWARD SHORE.,"Fix'd on his sins, his sufferings, and his fall:"
5269,EDWARD SHORE.,"His ruffled mind was pictured in his face,"
5270,EDWARD SHORE.,Once the fair seat of dignity and grace:
5271,EDWARD SHORE.,Great was the danger of a man so prone
5272,EDWARD SHORE.,"To think of madness, and to think alone;"
5273,EDWARD SHORE.,"Yet pride still lived, and struggled to sustain"
5274,EDWARD SHORE.,The drooping spirit and the roving brain;
5275,EDWARD SHORE.,"But this too fail'd:  a Friend his freedom gave,"
5276,EDWARD SHORE.,And sent him help the threat'ning world to brave;
5277,EDWARD SHORE.,"Gave solid counsel what to seek or flee,"
5278,EDWARD SHORE.,But still would stranger to his person be:
5279,EDWARD SHORE.,"In vain! the truth determined to explore,"
5280,EDWARD SHORE.,He traced the Friend whom he had wrong'd before.
5281,EDWARD SHORE.,This was too much; both aided and advised
5282,EDWARD SHORE.,"By one who shunn'd him, pitied, and despised:"
5283,EDWARD SHORE.,"He bore it not; 'twas a deciding stroke,"
5284,EDWARD SHORE.,And on his reason like a torrent broke:
5285,EDWARD SHORE.,"In dreadful stillness he appear'd a while,"
5286,EDWARD SHORE.,With vacant horror and a ghastly smile;
5287,EDWARD SHORE.,"Then rose at once into the frantic rage,"
5288,EDWARD SHORE.,"That force controlled not, nor could love assuage."
5289,EDWARD SHORE.,"Friends now appear'd, but in the Man was seen"
5290,EDWARD SHORE.,"The angry Maniac, with vindictive mien;"
5291,EDWARD SHORE.,Too late their pity gave to care and skill
5292,EDWARD SHORE.,The hurried mind and ever-wandering will:
5293,EDWARD SHORE.,"Unnoticed pass'd all time, and not a ray"
5294,EDWARD SHORE.,Of reason broke on his benighted way;
5295,EDWARD SHORE.,"But now he spurn'd the straw in pure disdain,"
5296,EDWARD SHORE.,And now laugh'd loudly at the clinking chain.
5297,EDWARD SHORE.,"Then, as its wrath subsided by degrees,"
5298,EDWARD SHORE.,"The mind sank slowly to infantine ease,"
5299,EDWARD SHORE.,"To playful folly, and to causeless joy,"
5300,EDWARD SHORE.,"Speech without aim, and without end, employ;"
5301,EDWARD SHORE.,"He drew fantastic figures on the wall,"
5302,EDWARD SHORE.,And gave some wild relation of them all;
5303,EDWARD SHORE.,"With brutal shape he join'd the human face,"
5304,EDWARD SHORE.,And idiot smiles approved the motley race.
5305,EDWARD SHORE.,"Harmless at length th' unhappy man was found,"
5306,EDWARD SHORE.,"The spirit settled, but the reason drown'd;"
5307,EDWARD SHORE.,And all the dreadful tempest died away
5308,EDWARD SHORE.,To the dull stillness of the misty day.
5309,EDWARD SHORE.,And now his freedom he attain'd--if free
5310,EDWARD SHORE.,"The lost to reason, truth, and hope, can be;"
5311,EDWARD SHORE.,"His friends, or wearied with the charge, or sure"
5312,EDWARD SHORE.,"The harmless wretch was now beyond a cure,"
5313,EDWARD SHORE.,"Gave him to wander where he pleased, and find"
5314,EDWARD SHORE.,His own resources for the eager mind:
5315,EDWARD SHORE.,"The playful children of the place he meets,"
5316,EDWARD SHORE.,Playful with them he rambles through the streets;
5317,EDWARD SHORE.,"In all they need, his stronger arm he lends,"
5318,EDWARD SHORE.,And his lost mind to these approving friends.
5319,EDWARD SHORE.,"That gentle Maid, whom once the Youth had loved,"
5320,EDWARD SHORE.,Is now with mild religious pity moved;
5321,EDWARD SHORE.,"Kindly she chides his boyish flights, while he"
5322,EDWARD SHORE.,Will for a moment fix'd and pensive be;
5323,EDWARD SHORE.,"And as she trembling speaks, his lively eyes"
5324,EDWARD SHORE.,"Explore her looks, he listens to her sighs;"
5325,EDWARD SHORE.,"Charm'd by her voice, th' harmonious sounds invade"
5326,EDWARD SHORE.,"His clouded mind, and for a time persuade:"
5327,EDWARD SHORE.,"Like a pleased infant, who has newly caught"
5328,EDWARD SHORE.,"From the maternal glance a gleam of thought,"
5329,EDWARD SHORE.,"He stands enrapt, the half-known voice to hear,"
5330,EDWARD SHORE.,"And starts, half conscious, at the falling tear."
5331,EDWARD SHORE.,"Rarely from town, nor then unwatch'd, he goes,"
5332,EDWARD SHORE.,"In darker mood, as if to hide his woes;"
5333,EDWARD SHORE.,"Returning soon, he with impatience seeks"
5334,EDWARD SHORE.,"His youthful friends, and shouts, and sings, and speaks;"
5335,EDWARD SHORE.,Speaks a wild speech with action all is wild -
5336,EDWARD SHORE.,"The children's leader, and himself a child;"
5337,EDWARD SHORE.,"He spins their top, or, at their bidding, bends"
5338,EDWARD SHORE.,"His back, while o'er it leap his laughing friends;"
5339,EDWARD SHORE.,"Simple and weak, he acts the boy once more,"
5340,EDWARD SHORE.,And heedless children call him Silly Shore.

5772,JESSE AND COLIN.,
5773,JESSE AND COLIN.,A Vicar died and left his Daughter poor -
5774,JESSE AND COLIN.,"It hurt her not, she was not rich before:"
5775,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Her humble share of worldly goods she sold,"
5776,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Paid every debt, and then her fortune told;"
5777,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And found, with youth and beauty, hope and health,"
5778,JESSE AND COLIN.,Two hundred guineas was her worldly wealth;
5779,JESSE AND COLIN.,"It then remain'd to choose her path in life,"
5780,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And first, said Jesse, ""Shall I be a wife? -"
5781,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Colin is mild and civil, kind and just,"
5782,JESSE AND COLIN.,"I know his love, his temper I can trust;"
5783,JESSE AND COLIN.,"But small his farm, it asks perpetual care,"
5784,JESSE AND COLIN.,And we must toil as well as trouble share:
5785,JESSE AND COLIN.,"True, he was taught in all the gentle arts"
5786,JESSE AND COLIN.,That raise the soul and soften human hearts;
5787,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And boasts a parent, who deserves to shine"
5788,JESSE AND COLIN.,"In higher class, and I could wish her mine;"
5789,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Nor wants he will his station to improve,"
5790,JESSE AND COLIN.,A just ambition waked by faithful love;
5791,JESSE AND COLIN.,Still is he poor--and here my Father's Friend
5792,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Deigns for his Daughter, as her own, to send:"
5793,JESSE AND COLIN.,"A worthy lady, who it seems has known"
5794,JESSE AND COLIN.,A world of griefs and troubles of her own:
5795,JESSE AND COLIN.,I was an infant when she came a guest
5796,JESSE AND COLIN.,Beneath my father's humble roof to rest;
5797,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Her kindred all unfeeling, vast her woes,"
5798,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Such her complaint, and there she found repose;"
5799,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Enrich'd by fortune, now she nobly lives,"
5800,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And nobly, from the bless'd abundance, gives;"
5801,JESSE AND COLIN.,"The grief, the want, of human life she knows,"
5802,JESSE AND COLIN.,And comfort there and here relief bestows:
5803,JESSE AND COLIN.,But are they not dependants?--Foolish pride!
5804,JESSE AND COLIN.,Am I not honour'd by such friend and guide?
5805,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Have I a home"" (here Jesse dropp'd a tear),"
5806,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""Or friend beside?""--A faithful friend was near."
5807,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Now Colin came, at length resolved to lay"
5808,JESSE AND COLIN.,"His heart before her, and to urge her stay:"
5809,JESSE AND COLIN.,"True, his own plough the gentle Colin drove,"
5810,JESSE AND COLIN.,An humble farmer with aspiring love;
5811,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Who, urged by passion, never dared till now,"
5812,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Thus urged by fears, his trembling hopes avow:"
5813,JESSE AND COLIN.,Her father's glebe he managed; every year
5814,JESSE AND COLIN.,The grateful Vicar held the youth more dear;
5815,JESSE AND COLIN.,"He saw indeed the prize in Colin's view,"
5816,JESSE AND COLIN.,And wish'd his Jesse with a man so true:
5817,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Timid as true, he urged with anxious air"
5818,JESSE AND COLIN.,"His tender hope, and made the trembling prayer,"
5819,JESSE AND COLIN.,"When Jesse saw, nor could with coldness see,"
5820,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Such fond respect, such tried sincerity;"
5821,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Grateful for favours to her father dealt,"
5822,JESSE AND COLIN.,She more than grateful for his passion felt;
5823,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Nor could she frown on one so good and kind,"
5824,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Yet fear'd to smile, and was unfix'd in mind;"
5825,JESSE AND COLIN.,But prudence placed the Female Friend in view -
5826,JESSE AND COLIN.,What might not one so rich and grateful do?
5827,JESSE AND COLIN.,"So lately, too, the good old Vicar died,"
5828,JESSE AND COLIN.,His faithful daughter must not cast aside
5829,JESSE AND COLIN.,"The signs of filial grief, and be a ready bride."
5830,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Thus, led by prudence, to the Lady's seat"
5831,JESSE AND COLIN.,The Village-Beauty purposed to retreat;
5832,JESSE AND COLIN.,"But, as in hard-fought fields the victor knows"
5833,JESSE AND COLIN.,"What to the vanquish'd he in honour owes,"
5834,JESSE AND COLIN.,"So, in this conquest over powerful love,"
5835,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Prudence resolved a generous foe to prove,"
5836,JESSE AND COLIN.,And Jesse felt a mingled fear and pain
5837,JESSE AND COLIN.,"In her dismission of a faithful swain,"
5838,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Gave her kind thanks, and when she saw his woe,"
5839,JESSE AND COLIN.,Kindly betray'd that she was loth to go;
5840,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""But would she promise, if abroad she met"
5841,JESSE AND COLIN.,"A frowning world, she would remember yet"
5842,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Where dwelt a friend?""--""That could she not forget."""
5843,JESSE AND COLIN.,And thus they parted; but each faithful heart
5844,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Felt the compulsion, and refused to part."
5845,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Now, by the morning mail the timid Maid"
5846,JESSE AND COLIN.,Was to that kind and wealthy Dame conveyed;
5847,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Whose invitation, when her father died,"
5848,JESSE AND COLIN.,Jesse as comfort to her heart applied;
5849,JESSE AND COLIN.,She knew the days her generous Friend had seen -
5850,JESSE AND COLIN.,"As wife and widow, evil days had been;"
5851,JESSE AND COLIN.,"She married early, and for half her life"
5852,JESSE AND COLIN.,Was an insulted and forsaken wife;
5853,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Widow'd and poor, her angry father gave,"
5854,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Mix'd with reproach, the pittance of a slave;"
5855,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Forgetful brothers pass'd her, but she knew"
5856,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Her humbler friends, and to their home withdrew:"
5857,JESSE AND COLIN.,The good old Vicar to her sire applied
5858,JESSE AND COLIN.,"For help, and help'd her when her sire denied."
5859,JESSE AND COLIN.,"When in few years Death stalk'd through bower and hall,"
5860,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Sires, sons, and sons of sons, were buried all,"
5861,JESSE AND COLIN.,"She then abounded, and had wealth to spare"
5862,JESSE AND COLIN.,For softening grief she once was doom'd to share;
5863,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Thus train'd in misery's school, and taught to feel,"
5864,JESSE AND COLIN.,She would rejoice an orphan's woes to heal:  -
5865,JESSE AND COLIN.,"So Jesse thought, who look'd within her breast,"
5866,JESSE AND COLIN.,And thence conceived how bounteous minds are bless'd.
5867,JESSE AND COLIN.,From her vast mansion look'd the Lady down
5868,JESSE AND COLIN.,On humbler buildings of a busy town;
5869,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Thence came her friends of either sex, and all"
5870,JESSE AND COLIN.,With whom she lived on terms reciprocal:
5871,JESSE AND COLIN.,"They pass'd the hours with their accustom'd ease,"
5872,JESSE AND COLIN.,"As guests inclined, but not compelled, to please;"
5873,JESSE AND COLIN.,"But there were others in the mansion found,"
5874,JESSE AND COLIN.,"For office chosen, and by duties bound;"
5875,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Three female rivals, each of power possess'd,"
5876,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Th' attendant Maid, poor Friend, and kindred Guest."
5877,JESSE AND COLIN.,"To these came Jesse, as a seaman thrown"
5878,JESSE AND COLIN.,By the rude storm upon a coast unknown:
5879,JESSE AND COLIN.,"The view was flattering, civil seem'd the race,"
5880,JESSE AND COLIN.,But all unknown the dangers of the place.
5881,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Few hours had pass'd, when, from attendants freed"
5882,JESSE AND COLIN.,"The Lady utter'd, ""This is kind indeed;"
5883,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Believe me, love! that I for one like you"
5884,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Have daily pray'd, a friend discreet and true;"
5885,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Oh! wonder not that I on you depend,"
5886,JESSE AND COLIN.,You are mine own hereditary friend:
5887,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Hearken, my Jesse, never can I trust"
5888,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Beings ungrateful, selfish, and unjust;"
5889,JESSE AND COLIN.,"But you are present, and my load of care"
5890,JESSE AND COLIN.,Your love will serve to lighten and to share:
5891,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Come near me, Jesse--let not those below"
5892,JESSE AND COLIN.,Of my reliance on your friendship know;
5893,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Look as they look, be in their freedoms free -"
5894,JESSE AND COLIN.,"But all they say do you convey to me."""
5895,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Here Jesse's thoughts to Colin's cottage flew,"
5896,JESSE AND COLIN.,And with such speed she scarce their absence knew.
5897,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""Jane loves her mistress, and should she depart,"
5898,JESSE AND COLIN.,"I lose her service, and she breaks her heart;"
5899,JESSE AND COLIN.,"My ways and wishes, looks and thoughts, she knows,"
5900,JESSE AND COLIN.,And duteous care by close attention shows:
5901,JESSE AND COLIN.,"But is she faithful? in temptation strong,"
5902,JESSE AND COLIN.,Will she not wrong me? ah! I fear the wrong;
5903,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Your father loved me; now, in time of need,"
5904,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Watch for my good, and to his place succeed."
5905,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""Blood doesn't bind--that Girl, who every day"
5906,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Eats of my bread, would wish my life away;"
5907,JESSE AND COLIN.,"I am her dear relation, and she thinks"
5908,JESSE AND COLIN.,"To make her fortune, an ambitious minx!"
5909,JESSE AND COLIN.,"She only courts me for the prospect's sake,"
5910,JESSE AND COLIN.,Because she knows I have a Will to make;
5911,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Yes, love! my Will delay'd, I know not how -"
5912,JESSE AND COLIN.,"But you are here, and I will make it now."
5913,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""That idle creature, keep her in your view,"
5914,JESSE AND COLIN.,"See what she does, what she desires to do;"
5915,JESSE AND COLIN.,"On her young mind may artful villains prey,"
5916,JESSE AND COLIN.,And to my plate and jewels find a way:
5917,JESSE AND COLIN.,"A pleasant humour has the girl; her smile,"
5918,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And cheerful manner, tedious hours beguile:"
5919,JESSE AND COLIN.,"But well observe her, ever near her be,"
5920,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Close in your thoughts, in your professions free."
5921,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""Again, my Jesse, hear what I advise,"
5922,JESSE AND COLIN.,And watch a woman ever in disguise;
5923,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Issop, that widow, serious, subtle, sly -"
5924,JESSE AND COLIN.,But what of this?--I must have company:
5925,JESSE AND COLIN.,"She markets for me, and although she makes"
5926,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Profit, no doubt, of all she undertakes,"
5927,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Yet she is one I can to all produce,"
5928,JESSE AND COLIN.,And all her talents are in daily use:
5929,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Deprived of her, I may another find"
5930,JESSE AND COLIN.,"As sly and selfish, with a weaker mind:"
5931,JESSE AND COLIN.,"But never trust her, she is full of art,"
5932,JESSE AND COLIN.,And worms herself into the closest heart;
5933,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Seem then, I pray you, careless in her sight,"
5934,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Nor let her know, my love, how we unite."
5935,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""Do, my good Jesse, cast a view around,"
5936,JESSE AND COLIN.,And let no wrong within my house be found;
5937,JESSE AND COLIN.,That Girl associates with--I know not who
5938,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Are her companions, nor what ill they do;"
5939,JESSE AND COLIN.,"'Tis then the Widow plans, 'tis then she tries"
5940,JESSE AND COLIN.,Her various arts and schemes for fresh supplies;
5941,JESSE AND COLIN.,"'Tis then, if ever, Jane her duty quits,"
5942,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And, whom I know not, favours and admits:"
5943,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Oh! watch their movements all; for me 'tis hard,"
5944,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Indeed is vain, but you may keep a guard;"
5945,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And I, when none your watchful glance deceive,"
5946,JESSE AND COLIN.,"May make my Will, and think what I shall leave."""
5947,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Jesse, with fear, disgust, alarm, surprise,"
5948,JESSE AND COLIN.,Heard of these duties for her ears and eyes;
5949,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Heard by what service she must gain her bread,"
5950,JESSE AND COLIN.,And went with scorn and sorrow to her bed.
5951,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Jane was a servant fitted for her place,"
5952,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Experienced, cunning, fraudful, selfish, base;"
5953,JESSE AND COLIN.,Skill'd in those mean humiliating arts
5954,JESSE AND COLIN.,That make their way to proud and selfish hearts:
5955,JESSE AND COLIN.,"By instinct taught, she felt an awe, a fear,"
5956,JESSE AND COLIN.,"For Jesse's upright, simple character;"
5957,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Whom with gross flattery she awhile assail'd,"
5958,JESSE AND COLIN.,And then beheld with hatred when it fail'd;
5959,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Yet, trying still upon her mind for hold,"
5960,JESSE AND COLIN.,She all the secrets of the mansion told;
5961,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And, to invite an equal trust, she drew"
5962,JESSE AND COLIN.,Of every mind a bold and rapid view;
5963,JESSE AND COLIN.,"But on the widow'd Friend with deep disdain,"
5964,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And rancorous envy, dwelt the treacherous Jane:"
5965,JESSE AND COLIN.,"In vain such arts;--without deceit or pride,"
5966,JESSE AND COLIN.,"With a just taste and feeling for her guide,"
5967,JESSE AND COLIN.,"From all contagion Jesse kept apart,"
5968,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Free in her manners, guarded in her heart."
5969,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Jesse one morn was thoughtful, and her sigh"
5970,JESSE AND COLIN.,The Widow heard as she was passing by;
5971,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And--""Well!"" she said, ""is that some distant swain,"
5972,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Or aught with us, that gives your bosom pain?"
5973,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Come, we are fellow-sufferers, slaves in thrall,"
5974,JESSE AND COLIN.,And tasks and griefs are common to us all;
5975,JESSE AND COLIN.,Think not my frankness strange:  they love to paint
5976,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Their state with freedom, who endure restraint;"
5977,JESSE AND COLIN.,And there is something in that speaking eye
5978,JESSE AND COLIN.,And sober mien that prove I may rely:
5979,JESSE AND COLIN.,"You came a stranger; to my words attend,"
5980,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Accept my offer, and you find a friend;"
5981,JESSE AND COLIN.,"It is a labyrinth in which you stray,"
5982,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Come, hold my clue, and I will lead the way."
5983,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""Good Heav'n! that one so jealous, envious, base,"
5984,JESSE AND COLIN.,Should be the mistress of so sweet a place;
5985,JESSE AND COLIN.,"She, who so long herself was low and poor,"
5986,JESSE AND COLIN.,Now broods suspicious on her useless store;
5987,JESSE AND COLIN.,"She loves to see us abject, loves to deal"
5988,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Her insult round, and then pretends to feel:"
5989,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Prepare to cast all dignity aside,"
5990,JESSE AND COLIN.,"For know, your talents will be quickly tried;"
5991,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Nor think, from favours past a friend to gain, -"
5992,JESSE AND COLIN.,'Tis but by duties we our posts maintain:
5993,JESSE AND COLIN.,"I read her novels, gossip through the town,"
5994,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And daily go, for idle stories down;"
5995,JESSE AND COLIN.,"I cheapen all she buys, and bear the curse"
5996,JESSE AND COLIN.,Of honest tradesmen for my niggard purse;
5997,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And, when for her this meanness I display,"
5998,JESSE AND COLIN.,"She cries, 'I heed not what I throw away;'"
5999,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Of secret bargains I endure the shame,"
6000,JESSE AND COLIN.,And stake my credit for our fish and game;
6001,JESSE AND COLIN.,Oft has she smiled to hear 'her generous soul
6002,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Would gladly give, but stoops to my control:'"
6003,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Nay! I have heard her, when she chanced to come"
6004,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Where I contended for a petty sum,"
6005,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Affirm 'twas painful to behold such care,"
6006,JESSE AND COLIN.,'But Issop's nature is to pinch and spare:'
6007,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Thus all the meanness of the house is mine,"
6008,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And my reward--to scorn her, and to dine."
6009,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""See next that giddy thing, with neither pride"
6010,JESSE AND COLIN.,"To keep her safe, nor principle to guide:"
6011,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Poor, idle, simple flirt! as sure as fate"
6012,JESSE AND COLIN.,Her maiden-fame will have an early date:
6013,JESSE AND COLIN.,Of her beware; for all who live below
6014,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Have faults they wish not all the world to know,"
6015,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And she is fond of listening, full of doubt,"
6016,JESSE AND COLIN.,And stoops to guilt to find an error out.
6017,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""And now once more observe the artful Maid,"
6018,JESSE AND COLIN.,"A lying, prying, jilting, thievish jade;"
6019,JESSE AND COLIN.,"I think, my love, you would not condescend"
6020,JESSE AND COLIN.,"To call a low, illiterate girl your friend:"
6021,JESSE AND COLIN.,"But in our troubles we are apt, you know,"
6022,JESSE AND COLIN.,To lean on all who some compassion show;
6023,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And she has flexile features, acting eyes,"
6024,JESSE AND COLIN.,And seems with every look to sympathise;
6025,JESSE AND COLIN.,No mirror can a mortal's grief express
6026,JESSE AND COLIN.,"With more precision, or can feel it less;"
6027,JESSE AND COLIN.,"That proud, mean spirit, she by fawning courts"
6028,JESSE AND COLIN.,"By vulgar flattery, and by vile reports;"
6029,JESSE AND COLIN.,And by that proof she every instant gives
6030,JESSE AND COLIN.,"To one so mean, that yet a meaner lives."
6031,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""Come, I have drawn the curtain, and you see"
6032,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Your fellow-actors, all our company;"
6033,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Should you incline to throw reserve aside,"
6034,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And in my judgment and my love confide,"
6035,JESSE AND COLIN.,"I could some prospects open to your view,"
6036,JESSE AND COLIN.,"That ask attention--and, till then, adieu."""
6037,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""Farewell!"" said Jesse, hastening to her room,"
6038,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Where all she saw within, without, was gloom:"
6039,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Confused, perplex'd, she pass'd a dreary hour,"
6040,JESSE AND COLIN.,Before her reason could exert its power;
6041,JESSE AND COLIN.,"To her all seem'd mysterious, all allied"
6042,JESSE AND COLIN.,"To avarice, meanness, folly, craft, and pride;"
6043,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Wearied with thought, she breathed the garden's air,"
6044,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Then came the laughing Lass, and join'd her thore."
6045,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""My sweetest friend has dwelt with us a week,"
6046,JESSE AND COLIN.,And does she love us? be sincere and speak;
6047,JESSE AND COLIN.,My Aunt you cannot--Lord! how I should hate
6048,JESSE AND COLIN.,"To be like her, all misery and state;"
6049,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Proud, and yet envious, she disgusted sees"
6050,JESSE AND COLIN.,"All who are happy, and who look at ease."
6051,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Let friendship bind us, I will quickly show"
6052,JESSE AND COLIN.,Some favourites near us you'll be bless'd to know;
6053,JESSE AND COLIN.,"My aunt forbids it--but, can she expect,"
6054,JESSE AND COLIN.,"To soothe her spleen, we shall ourselves neglect?"
6055,JESSE AND COLIN.,Jane and the Widow were to watch and stay
6056,JESSE AND COLIN.,My free-born feet; I watch'd as well as they:
6057,JESSE AND COLIN.,Lo! what is this?--this simple key explores
6058,JESSE AND COLIN.,The dark recess that holds the Spinster's stores:
6059,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And, led by her ill star, I chanced to see"
6060,JESSE AND COLIN.,Where Issop keeps her stock of ratafie;
6061,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Used in the hours of anger and alarm,"
6062,JESSE AND COLIN.,"It makes her civil, and it keeps her warm:"
6063,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Thus bless'd with secrets both would choose to hide,"
6064,JESSE AND COLIN.,Their fears now grant me what their scorn denied.
6065,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""My freedom thus by their assent secured,"
6066,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Bad as it is, the place may be endured;"
6067,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And bad it is, but her estates, you know,"
6068,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And her beloved hoards, she must bestow;"
6069,JESSE AND COLIN.,"So we can slily our amusements take,"
6070,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And friends of demons, if they help us, make."""
6071,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""Strange creatures these,"" thought Jesse, half inclined"
6072,JESSE AND COLIN.,To smile at one malicious and yet kind;
6073,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Frank and yet cunning, with a heart to love"
6074,JESSE AND COLIN.,And malice prompt--the serpent and the dove;
6075,JESSE AND COLIN.,Here could she dwell? or could she yet depart?
6076,JESSE AND COLIN.,Could she be artful? could she bear with art? -
6077,JESSE AND COLIN.,"This splendid mansion gave the cottage grace,"
6078,JESSE AND COLIN.,She thought a dungeon was a happier place;
6079,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And Colin pleading, when he pleaded best,"
6080,JESSE AND COLIN.,Wrought not such sudden change in Jesse's breast.
6081,JESSE AND COLIN.,"The wondering maiden, who had only read"
6082,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Of such vile beings, saw them now with dread;"
6083,JESSE AND COLIN.,Safe in themselves--for nature has design'd
6084,JESSE AND COLIN.,The creature's poison harmless to the kind;
6085,JESSE AND COLIN.,But all beside who in the haunts are found
6086,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Must dread the poison, and must feel the wound."
6087,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Days full of care, slow weary weeks pass'd on,"
6088,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Eager to go, still Jesse was not gone;"
6089,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Her time in trifling, or in tears, she spent,"
6090,JESSE AND COLIN.,"She never gave, she never felt, content:"
6091,JESSE AND COLIN.,The Lady wonder'd that her humble guest
6092,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Strove not to please, would neither lie nor jest;"
6093,JESSE AND COLIN.,"She sought no news, no scandal would convey,"
6094,JESSE AND COLIN.,"But walk'd for health, and was at church to pray:"
6095,JESSE AND COLIN.,"All this displeased, and soon the Widow cried,"
6096,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""Let me be frank--I am not satisfied;"
6097,JESSE AND COLIN.,"You know my wishes, I your judgment trust;"
6098,JESSE AND COLIN.,"You can be useful, Jesse, and you must:"
6099,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Let me be plainer, child--I want an ear,"
6100,JESSE AND COLIN.,"When I am deaf, instead of mine to hear;"
6101,JESSE AND COLIN.,When mine is sleeping let your eye awake;
6102,JESSE AND COLIN.,"When I observe not, observation take:"
6103,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Alas! I rest not on my pillow laid,"
6104,JESSE AND COLIN.,Then threat'ning whispers make my soul afraid;
6105,JESSE AND COLIN.,"The tread of strangers to my ear ascends,"
6106,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Fed at my cost, the minions of my friends;"
6107,JESSE AND COLIN.,"While you, without a care, a wish to please,"
6108,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Eat the vile bread of idleness and ease."""
6109,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Th' indignant Girl, astonish'd, answer'd--""Nay!"
6110,JESSE AND COLIN.,"This instant, madam, let me haste away:"
6111,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Thus speaks my father's, thus an orphan's friend?"
6112,JESSE AND COLIN.,"This instant, lady, let your bounty end."""
6113,JESSE AND COLIN.,"The Lady frown'd indignant--""What!"" she cried,"
6114,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""A vicar's daughter with a princess' pride"
6115,JESSE AND COLIN.,And pauper's lot! but pitying I forgive;
6116,JESSE AND COLIN.,"How, simple Jesse, do you think to live?"
6117,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Have I not power to help you, foolish maid?"
6118,JESSE AND COLIN.,To my concerns be your attention paid;
6119,JESSE AND COLIN.,"With cheerful mind th' allotted duties take,"
6120,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And recollect I have a Will to make."""
6121,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Jesse, who felt as liberal natures feel,"
6122,JESSE AND COLIN.,"When thus the baser their designs reveal,"
6123,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Replied--""Those duties were to her unfit,"
6124,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Nor would her spirit to her tasks submit."""
6125,JESSE AND COLIN.,"In silent scorn the Lady sat awhile,"
6126,JESSE AND COLIN.,And then replied with stern contemptuous smile -
6127,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""Think you, fair madam, that you came to share"
6128,JESSE AND COLIN.,Fortunes like mine without a thought or care?
6129,JESSE AND COLIN.,"A guest, indeed! from every trouble free,"
6130,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Dress'd by my help, with not a care for me;"
6131,JESSE AND COLIN.,"When I a visit to your father made,"
6132,JESSE AND COLIN.,I for the poor assistance largely paid;
6133,JESSE AND COLIN.,"To his domestics I their tasks assign'd,"
6134,JESSE AND COLIN.,I fix'd the portion for his hungry hind;
6135,JESSE AND COLIN.,And had your father (simple man!) obey'd
6136,JESSE AND COLIN.,"My good advice, and watch'd as well as pray'd,"
6137,JESSE AND COLIN.,"He might have left you something with his prayers,"
6138,JESSE AND COLIN.,And lent some colour for these lofty airs. -
6139,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""In tears, my love!  Oh, then my soften'd heart"
6140,JESSE AND COLIN.,Cannot resist--we never more will part;
6141,JESSE AND COLIN.,"I need your friendship--I will be your friend,"
6142,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And, thus determined, to my Will attend."""
6143,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Jesse went forth, but with determined soul"
6144,JESSE AND COLIN.,"To fly such love, to break from such control:"
6145,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""I hear enough,"" the trembling damsel cried;"
6146,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Flight be my care, and Providence my guide:"
6147,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Ere yet a prisoner, I escape will make;"
6148,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Will, thus display'd, th' insidious arts forsake,"
6149,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And, as the rattle sounds, will fly the fatal snake."""
6150,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Jesse her thanks upon the morrow paid,"
6151,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Prepared to go, determined though afraid."
6152,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""Ungrateful creature!"" said the Lady, ""this"
6153,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Could I imagine?--are you frantic, miss?"
6154,JESSE AND COLIN.,"What! leave your friend, your prospects--is it true?"""
6155,JESSE AND COLIN.,"This Jesse answer'd by a mild ""Adieu?"""
6156,JESSE AND COLIN.,"The Dame replied ""Then houseless may you rove,"
6157,JESSE AND COLIN.,The starving victim to a guilty love;
6158,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Branded with shame, in sickness doom'd to nurse"
6159,JESSE AND COLIN.,"An ill-form'd cub, your scandal and your curse;"
6160,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Spurn'd by its scoundrel father, and ill fed"
6161,JESSE AND COLIN.,By surly rustics with the parish-bread! -
6162,JESSE AND COLIN.,Relent you not?--speak--yet I can forgive;
6163,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Still live with me.""--""With you,"" said Jesse, ""live?"
6164,JESSE AND COLIN.,"No! I would first endure what you describe,"
6165,JESSE AND COLIN.,Rather than breathe with your detested tribe;
6166,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Who long have feign'd, till now their very hearts"
6167,JESSE AND COLIN.,Are firmly fix'd in their accursed parts;
6168,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Who all profess esteem, and feel disdain,"
6169,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And all, with justice, of deceit complain;"
6170,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Whom I could pity, but that, while I stay,"
6171,JESSE AND COLIN.,My terror drives all kinder thoughts away;
6172,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Grateful for this, that, when I think of you,"
6173,JESSE AND COLIN.,"I little fear what poverty can do."""
6174,JESSE AND COLIN.,The angry matron her attendant Jane
6175,JESSE AND COLIN.,Summon'd in haste to soothe the fierce disdain:  -
6176,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""A vile detested wretch!"" the Lady cried,"
6177,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""Yet shall she be by many an effort tried,"
6178,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And, clogg'd with debt and fear, against her will abide;"
6179,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And, once secured, she never shall depart"
6180,JESSE AND COLIN.,Till I have proved the firmness of her heart:
6181,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Then when she dares not, would not, cannot go"
6182,JESSE AND COLIN.,"I'll make her feel what 'tis to use me so."""
6183,JESSE AND COLIN.,"The pensive Colin in his garden stray'd,"
6184,JESSE AND COLIN.,But felt not then the beauties it display'd;
6185,JESSE AND COLIN.,"There many a pleasant object met his view,"
6186,JESSE AND COLIN.,A rising wood of oaks behind it grew;
6187,JESSE AND COLIN.,"A stream ran by it, and the village-green"
6188,JESSE AND COLIN.,And public road were from the garden seen;
6189,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Save where the pine and larch the bound'ry made,"
6190,JESSE AND COLIN.,And on the rose-beds threw a softening shade.
6191,JESSE AND COLIN.,"The Mother sat beside the garden-door,"
6192,JESSE AND COLIN.,Dress'd as in times ere she and hers were poor;
6193,JESSE AND COLIN.,"The broad-laced cap was known in ancient days,"
6194,JESSE AND COLIN.,When madam's dress compell'd the village praise;
6195,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And still she look'd as in the times of old,"
6196,JESSE AND COLIN.,Ere his last farm the erring husband sold;
6197,JESSE AND COLIN.,"While yet the mansion stood in decent state,"
6198,JESSE AND COLIN.,And paupers waited at the well-known gate.
6199,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""Alas, my son!"" the Mother cried, ""and why"
6200,JESSE AND COLIN.,That silent grief and oft-repeated sigh?
6201,JESSE AND COLIN.,"True we are poor, but thou hast never felt"
6202,JESSE AND COLIN.,Pangs to thy father for his error dealt;
6203,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Pangs from strong hopes of visionary gain,"
6204,JESSE AND COLIN.,"For ever raised, and ever found in vain."
6205,JESSE AND COLIN.,"He rose unhappy from his fruitless schemes,"
6206,JESSE AND COLIN.,As guilty wretches from their blissful dreams;
6207,JESSE AND COLIN.,"But thou wert then, my son, a playful child,"
6208,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Wondering at grief, gay, innocent, and wild;"
6209,JESSE AND COLIN.,Listening at times to thy poor mother's sighs
6210,JESSE AND COLIN.,With curious looks and innocent surprise;
6211,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Thy father dying, thou my virtuous boy,"
6212,JESSE AND COLIN.,"My comfort always, waked my soul to joy;"
6213,JESSE AND COLIN.,"With the poor remnant of our fortune left,"
6214,JESSE AND COLIN.,Thou hast our station of its gloom bereft:
6215,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Thy lively temper, and thy cheerful air,"
6216,JESSE AND COLIN.,Have cast a smile on sadness and despair;
6217,JESSE AND COLIN.,Thy active hand has dealt to this poor space
6218,JESSE AND COLIN.,The bliss of plenty and the charm of grace;
6219,JESSE AND COLIN.,And all around us wonder when they find
6220,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Such taste and strength, such skill and power combined;"
6221,JESSE AND COLIN.,"There is no mother, Colin, no not one,"
6222,JESSE AND COLIN.,"But envies me so kind, so good a son;"
6223,JESSE AND COLIN.,"By thee supported on this failing side,"
6224,JESSE AND COLIN.,Weakness itself awakes a parent's pride:
6225,JESSE AND COLIN.,"I bless the stroke that was my grief before,"
6226,JESSE AND COLIN.,And feel such joy that 'tis disease no more;
6227,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Shielded by thee, my want becomes my wealth,"
6228,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And, soothed by Colin, sickness smiles at health;"
6229,JESSE AND COLIN.,"The old men love thee, they repeat thy praise,"
6230,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And say, like thee were youth in earlier days;"
6231,JESSE AND COLIN.,"While every village-maiden cries, 'How gay,"
6232,JESSE AND COLIN.,"How smart, how brave, how good is Colin Grey!'"
6233,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""Yet art thou sad; alas! my son, I know"
6234,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Thy heart is wounded, and the cure is slow;"
6235,JESSE AND COLIN.,Fain would I think that Jesse still may come
6236,JESSE AND COLIN.,To share the comforts of our rustic home:
6237,JESSE AND COLIN.,"She surely loved thee; I have seen the maid,"
6238,JESSE AND COLIN.,When thou hast kindly brought the Vicar aid -
6239,JESSE AND COLIN.,"When thou hast eased his bosom of its pain,"
6240,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Oh! I have seen her--she will come again."""
6241,JESSE AND COLIN.,The Matron ceased; and Colin stood the while
6242,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Silent, but striving for a grateful smile;"
6243,JESSE AND COLIN.,"He then replied--""Ah! sure, had Jesse stay'd,"
6244,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And shared the comforts of our sylvan shade,"
6245,JESSE AND COLIN.,The tenderest duty and the fondest love
6246,JESSE AND COLIN.,Would not have fail'd that generous heart to move;
6247,JESSE AND COLIN.,"A grateful pity would have ruled her breast,"
6248,JESSE AND COLIN.,And my distresses would have made me bless'd.
6249,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""But she is gone, and ever has in view"
6250,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Grandeur and taste,--and what will then ensue?"
6251,JESSE AND COLIN.,Surprise and then delight in scenes so fair and new;
6252,JESSE AND COLIN.,"For many a day, perhaps for many a week,"
6253,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Home will have charms, and to her bosom speak;"
6254,JESSE AND COLIN.,"But thoughtless ease, and affluence, and pride,"
6255,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Seen day by day, will draw the heart aside:"
6256,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And she at length, though gentle and sincere,"
6257,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Will think no more of our enjoyments here."""
6258,JESSE AND COLIN.,Sighing he spake--but hark! he hears th' approach
6259,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Of rattling wheels! and, lo! the evening coach;"
6260,JESSE AND COLIN.,Once more the movement of the horses' feet
6261,JESSE AND COLIN.,Makes the fond heart with strong emotion beat:
6262,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Faint were his hopes, but ever had the sight"
6263,JESSE AND COLIN.,Drawn him to gaze beside his gate at night;
6264,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And when with rapid wheels it hurried by,"
6265,JESSE AND COLIN.,He grieved his parent with a hopeless sigh;
6266,JESSE AND COLIN.,And could the blessing have been bought--what sum
6267,JESSE AND COLIN.,Had he not offer'd to have Jesse come!
6268,JESSE AND COLIN.,"She came--he saw her bending from the door,"
6269,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Her face, her smile, and he beheld no more;"
6270,JESSE AND COLIN.,Lost in his joy--the mother lent her aid
6271,JESSE AND COLIN.,T'assist and to detain the willing Maid;
6272,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Who thought her late, her present home to make,"
6273,JESSE AND COLIN.,Sure of a welcome for the Vicar's sake:
6274,JESSE AND COLIN.,"But the good parent was so pleased, so kind,"
6275,JESSE AND COLIN.,"So pressing Colin, she so much inclined,"
6276,JESSE AND COLIN.,"That night advanced; and then, so long detain'd,"
6277,JESSE AND COLIN.,"No wishes to depart she felt, or feign'd;"
6278,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Yet long in doubt she stood, and then perforce remain'd."
6279,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Here was a lover fond, a friend sincere;"
6280,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Here was content and joy, for she was here:"
6281,JESSE AND COLIN.,"In the mild evening, in the scene around,"
6282,JESSE AND COLIN.,"The Maid, now free, peculiar beauties found;"
6283,JESSE AND COLIN.,"Blended with village-tones, the evening gale"
6284,JESSE AND COLIN.,Gave the sweet night-bird's warblings to the vale:
6285,JESSE AND COLIN.,"The Youth, embolden'd, yet abash'd, now told"
6286,JESSE AND COLIN.,"His fondest wish, nor found the maiden cold;"
6287,JESSE AND COLIN.,"The Mother smiling whisper'd, ""Let him go"
6288,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And seek the licence!""  Jesse answer'd ""No:"""
6289,JESSE AND COLIN.,But Colin went.--I know not if they live
6290,JESSE AND COLIN.,With all the comforts wealth and plenty give;
6291,JESSE AND COLIN.,"But with pure joy to envious souls denied,"
6292,JESSE AND COLIN.,To suppliant meanness and suspicious pride;
6293,JESSE AND COLIN.,"And village-maids of happy couples say,"
6294,JESSE AND COLIN.,"""They live like Jesse Bourn and Colin Grey."""

6331,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,
6332,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"A serious Toyman in the city dwelt,"
6333,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Who much concern for his religion felt;
6334,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Reading, he changed his tenets, read again,"
6335,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And various questions could with skill maintain;
6336,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Papist and Quaker if we set aside,"
6337,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,He had the road of every traveller tried;
6338,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"There walk'd a while, and on a sudden turn'd"
6339,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Into some by-way he had just discern'd:
6340,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"He had a nephew, Fulham: --Fulham went"
6341,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"His Uncle's way, with every turn content;"
6342,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"He saw his pious kinsman's watchful care,"
6343,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And thought such anxious pains his own might spare,"
6344,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And he the truth obtain'd, without the toil, might share."
6345,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"In fact, young Fulham, though he little read,"
6346,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Perceived his uncle was by fancy led;
6347,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And smiled to see the constant care he took,"
6348,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Collating creed with creed, and book with book."
6349,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,At length the senior fix'd; I pass the sect
6350,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"He call'd a Church, 'twas precious and elect;"
6351,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Yet the seed fell not in the richest soil,"
6352,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,For few disciples paid the preacher's toil;
6353,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"All in an attic room were wont to meet,"
6354,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"These few disciples, at their pastor's feet;"
6355,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"With these went Fulham, who, discreet and grave,"
6356,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Follow'd the light his worthy uncle gave;
6357,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Till a warm Preacher found the way t'impart
6358,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Awakening feelings to his torpid heart:
6359,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Some weighty truths, and of unpleasant kind,"
6360,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Sank, though resisted, in his struggling mind:"
6361,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"He wish'd to fly them, but, compell'd to stay,"
6362,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Truth to the waking Conscience found her way;
6363,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"For though the Youth was call'd a prudent lad,"
6364,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And prudent was, yet serious faults he had -"
6365,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Who now reflected--""Much am I surprised;"
6366,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,I find these notions cannot be despised:
6367,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"No! there is something I perceive at last,"
6368,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Although my uncle cannot hold it fast;
6369,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Though I the strictness of these men reject,"
6370,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Yet I determine to be circumspect:
6371,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"This man alarms me, and I must begin"
6372,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,To look more closely to the things within:
6373,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"These sons of zeal have I derided long,"
6374,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,But now begin to think the laugher's wrong!
6375,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Nay, my good uncle, by all teachers moved,"
6376,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Will be preferr'd to him who none approved; -
6377,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Better to love amiss than nothing to have loved."""
6378,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Such were his thoughts, when Conscience first began"
6379,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,To hold close converse with th' awaken'd man:
6380,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"He from that time reserved and cautious grew,"
6381,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And for his duties felt obedience due;
6382,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Pious he was not, but he fear'd the pain"
6383,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Of sins committed, nor would sin again:"
6384,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Whene'er he stray'd, he found his Conscience rose,"
6385,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Like one determined what was ill t'oppose,"
6386,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"What wrong t'accuse, what secret to disclose;"
6387,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"To drag forth every latent act to light,"
6388,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And fix them fully in the actor's sight:
6389,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"This gave him trouble, but he still confess'd"
6390,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"The labour useful, for it brought him rest."
6391,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"The Uncle died, and when the Nephew read"
6392,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"The will, and saw the substance of the dead -"
6393,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Five hundred guineas, with a stock in trade -"
6394,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"He much rejoiced, and thought his fortune made;"
6395,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Yet felt aspiring pleasure at the sight,"
6396,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And for increase, increasing appetite;"
6397,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Desire of profit idle habits check'd
6398,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,(For Fulham's virtue was to be correct);
6399,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,He and his Conscience had their compact made -
6400,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""Urge me with truth, and you will soon persuade;"
6401,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"But not,"" he cried, ""for mere ideal things"
6402,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Give me to feel those terror-breeding stings."""
6403,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""Let not such thoughts,"" she said, ""your mind confound;"
6404,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Trifles may wake me, but they never wound;"
6405,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"In them indeed there is a wrong and right,"
6406,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,But you will find me pliant and polite;
6407,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Not like a Conscience of the dotard kind,"
6408,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Awake to dreams, to dire offences blind:"
6409,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Let all within be pure, in all beside"
6410,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Be your own master, governor, and guide;"
6411,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Alive to danger, in temptation strong,"
6412,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And I shall sleep our whole existence long."""
6413,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""Sweet be thy sleep,"" said Fulham; ""strong must be"
6414,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,The tempting ill that gains access to me:
6415,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Never will I to evil deed consent;
6416,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Or, if surprised, oh! how will I repent!"
6417,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Should gain be doubtful, soon would I restore"
6418,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"The dangerous good, or give it to the poor;"
6419,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Repose for them my growing wealth shall buy,"
6420,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Or build--who knows?--an hospital like Guy.
6421,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Yet why such means to soothe the smart within,"
6422,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"While firmly purposed to renounce the sin?"""
6423,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Thus our young Trader and his Conscience dwelt
6424,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"In mutual love, and great the joy they felt;"
6425,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"But yet in small concerns, in trivial things,"
6426,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""She was,"" he said, ""too ready with the stings;"""
6427,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And he too apt, in search of growing gains,"
6428,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,To lose the fear of penalties and pains:
6429,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Yet these were trifling bickerings, petty jars,"
6430,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Domestic strifes, preliminary wars;"
6431,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"He ventured little, little she express'd"
6432,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Of indignation, and they both had rest."
6433,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Thus was he fix d to walk the worthy way,"
6434,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,When profit urged him to a bold essay:  -
6435,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,A time was that when all at pleasure gamed
6436,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"In lottery chances, yet a law unblamed:"
6437,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,This Fulham tried; who would to him advance
6438,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"A pound or crown, he gave in turn a chance"
6439,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"For weighty prize--and should they nothing share,"
6440,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,They had their crown or pound in Fulham's ware;
6441,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Thus the old stores within the shop were sold
6442,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"For that which none refuses, new or old."
6443,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Was this unjust? yet Conscience could not rest,"
6444,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"But made a mighty struggle in the breast,"
6445,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And gave th' aspiring man an early proof
6446,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,That should they war he would have work enough:
6447,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""Suppose,"" said she, ""your vended numbers rise"
6448,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"The same with those which gain each real prize,"
6449,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"(Such your proposal), can you ruin shun?"" -"
6450,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""A hundred thousand,"" he replied, ""to one."""
6451,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""Still it may happen.""--""I the sum must pay."""
6452,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""You know you cannot.""--""I can run away."""
6453,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""That is dishonest.""--""Nay, but you must wink"
6454,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"At a chance hit:  it cannot be, I think."
6455,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Upon my conduct as a whole decide,"
6456,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Such trifling errors let my virtues hide.
6457,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Fail I at meeting? am I sleepy there?
6458,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,My purse refuse I with the priest to share?
6459,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Do I deny the poor a helping hand?
6460,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Or stop the wicked women in the Strand?
6461,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Or drink at club beyond a certain pitch?
6462,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Which are your charges?  Conscience, tell me which?"""
6463,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""'Tis well,"" said she, ""but--""  ""Nay, I pray, have done:"
6464,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Trust me, I will not into danger run."""
6465,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"The lottery drawn, not one demand was made;"
6466,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Fulham gain'd profit and increase of trade.
6467,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""See now,"" said he--for Conscience yet arose -"
6468,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""How foolish 'tis such measures to oppose:"
6469,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Have I not blameless thus my state advanced?"""
6470,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""Still,"" mutter'd Conscience, ""still it might have chanced."""
6471,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""Might!"" said our hero:  ""who is so exact"
6472,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"As to inquire what might have been a fact?"""
6473,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Now Fulham's shop contain'd a curious view
6474,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Of costly trifles, elegant and new:"
6475,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,The papers told where kind mammas might buy
6476,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,The gayest toys to charm an infant's eye;
6477,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Where generous beaux might gentle damsels please,"
6478,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And travellers call who cross the land or seas,"
6479,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And find the curious art, the neat device,"
6480,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Of precious value and of trifling price.
6481,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Here Conscience rested, she was pleased to find"
6482,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,No less an active than an honest mind;
6483,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"But when he named his price, and when he swore"
6484,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"His Conscience check'd him that he ask'd no more,"
6485,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,When half he sought had been a large increase
6486,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"On fair demand, she could not rest in peace;"
6487,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"(Beside th' affront to call th' adviser in,"
6488,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Who would prevent, to justify the sin):"
6489,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"She therefore told him that ""he vainly tried"
6490,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"To soothe her anger, conscious that he lied;"
6491,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"If thus he grasp'd at such usurious gains,"
6492,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"He must deserve, and should expect her pains."""
6493,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,The charge was strong; he would in part confess
6494,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Offence there was--But, who offended less?"
6495,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""What! is a mere assertion call'd a lie?"
6496,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And if it be, are men compell'd to buy?"
6497,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"'Twas strange that Conscience on such points should dwell,"
6498,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,While he was acting (he would call it) well;
6499,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"He bought as others buy, he sold as others sell;"
6500,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"There was no fraud, and he demanded cause"
6501,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Why he was troubled when he kept the laws?"""
6502,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""My laws!"" said Conscience.  ""What,"" said he, ""are thine?"
6503,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Oral or written, human or divine?"
6504,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Show me the chapter, let me see the text;"
6505,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,By laws uncertain subjects are perplex'd:
6506,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Let me my finger on the statute lay,"
6507,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And I shall feel it duty to obey."""
6508,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""Reflect,"" said Conscience, ""'twas your own desire"
6509,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,That I should warn you--does the compact tire?
6510,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Repent you this?--then bid me not advise,"
6511,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And rather hear your passions as they rise:
6512,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,So you may counsel and remonstrance shun;
6513,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,But then remember it is war begun;
6514,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And you may judge from some attacks, my friend,"
6515,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"What serious conflicts will on war attend."""
6516,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""Nay, but,"" at length the thoughtful man replied,"
6517,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""I say not that; I wish you for my guide;"
6518,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Wish for your checks and your reproofs--but then
6519,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Be like a conscience of my fellow-men;
6520,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Worthy I mean, and men of good report,"
6521,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And not the wretches who with Conscience sport:
6522,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"There's Bice, my friend, who passes off his grease"
6523,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Of pigs for bears', in pots a crown apiece;"
6524,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,His Conscience never checks him when he swears
6525,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,The fat he sells is honest fat of bears;
6526,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And so it is, for he contrives to give"
6527,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,A drachm to each--'tis thus that tradesmen live;
6528,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Now why should you and I be over-nice?
6529,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"What man is held in more repute than Bice?"""
6530,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Here ended the dispute; but yet 'twas plain
6531,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,The parties both expected strife again:
6532,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Their friendship cool'd, he look'd about and saw"
6533,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Numbers who seem'd unshackled by his awe;
6534,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"While like a schoolboy he was threatened still,"
6535,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Now for the deed, now only for the will:"
6536,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Here Conscience answered ""To thy neighbour's guide"
6537,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Thy neighbour leave, and in thine own confide."""
6538,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Such were each day the charges and replies,"
6539,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,When a new object caught the trader's eyes;
6540,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"A Vestry-patriot, could he gain the name,"
6541,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Would famous make him, and would pay the fame."
6542,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,He knew full well the sums bequeath'd in charge
6543,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"For schools, for almsmen, for the poor, were large;"
6544,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Report had told, and he could feel it true,"
6545,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,That most unfairly dealt the trusted few;
6546,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"No partners would they in their office take,"
6547,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Nor clear accounts at annual meetings make.
6548,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Aloud our hero in the vestry spoke
6549,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Of hidden deeds, and vow'd to draw the cloak;"
6550,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"It was the poor man's cause, and he for one"
6551,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Was quite determined to see justice done:
6552,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"His foes affected, laughter, then disdain,"
6553,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"They too were Ioud; and threat'ning, but in vain;"
6554,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"The pauper's friend, their foe, arose and spoke again;"
6555,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Fiercely he cried, ""Your garbled statements show"
6556,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,That you determine we shall nothing know;
6557,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"But we shall bring your hidden crimes to light,"
6558,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Give you to shame, and to the poor their right."""
6559,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Virtue like this might some approval ask -
6560,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"But Conscience sternly said, ""You wear a mask!"""
6561,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""At least,"" said Fulham, ""if I have a view"
6562,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"To serve myself, I serve the public too."""
6563,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Fulham, though check'd, retain'd his former zeal,"
6564,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And this the cautious rogues began to feel:
6565,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""Thus will he ever bark,"" in peevish tone"
6566,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"An elder cried--""the cur must have a bone."""
6567,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"They then began to hint, and to begin"
6568,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Was all they needed--it was felt within:
6569,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,In terms less veil'd an offer then was made;
6570,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Though distant still, it fail'd not to persuade:"
6571,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"More plainly then was every point proposed,"
6572,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Approved, accepted, and the bargain closed."
6573,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"The exulting paupers hail'd their Friend's success,"
6574,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And bade adieu to murmurs and distress.
6575,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Alas! their Friend had now superior light,"
6576,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And, view'd by that, he found that all was right;"
6577,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""There were no errors, the disbursements small;"
6578,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"This was the truth, and truth was due to all."""
6579,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And rested Conscience?  No! she would not rest,"
6580,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Yet was content with making a protest:
6581,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Some acts she now with less resistance bore,"
6582,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Nor took alarm so quickly as before:
6583,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Like those in towns besieged, who every ball"
6584,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"At first with terror view, and dread them all;"
6585,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"But, grown familiar with the scenes, they fear"
6586,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"The clanger less, as it approaches near;"
6587,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"So Conscience, more familiar with the view"
6588,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Of growing evils, less attentive grew:"
6589,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Yet he, who felt some pain and dreaded more,"
6590,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Gave a peace-offering to the angry poor.
6591,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Thus had he quiet--but the time was brief;
6592,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,From his new triumph sprang a cause of grief;
6593,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"In office join'd, and acting with the rest,"
6594,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,He must admit the sacramental test.
6595,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Now, as a sectary, he had all his life,"
6596,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"As he supposed, been with the Church at strife:  -"
6597,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"No rules of hers, no laws had he perused,"
6598,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Nor knew the tenets he by rote abused;
6599,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Yet Conscience here arose more fierce and strong
6600,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Than when she told of robbery and wrong.
6601,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""Change his religion!  No! he must be sure"
6602,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"That was a blow no Conscience eould endure."""
6603,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Though friend to Virtue, yet she oft abides"
6604,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"In early notions, fix'd by erring guides;"
6605,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And is more startled by a call from those,"
6606,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Than when the foulest crimes her rest oppose:
6607,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"By error taught, by prejudice misled,"
6608,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"She yields her rights, and Fancy rules instead;"
6609,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"When Conscience all her stings and terror deals,"
6610,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Not as Truth dictates, but as Fancy feels:"
6611,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And thus within our hero's troubled breast,"
6612,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Crime was less torture than the odious test.
6613,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"New forms, new measures, he must now embrace,"
6614,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,With sad conviction that they warr'd with grace;
6615,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"To his new church no former friend would come,"
6616,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,They scarce preferr'd her to the Church of Rome;
6617,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"But thinking much, and weighing guilt and gain,"
6618,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Conscience and he commuted for her pain;
6619,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Then promised Fulham to retain his creed,"
6620,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And their peculiar paupers still to feed;
6621,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Their attic-room (in secret) to attend,"
6622,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And not forget he was the preacher's friend:
6623,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Thus he proposed, and Conscience, troubled, tried,"
6624,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And wanting peace, reluctantly complied."
6625,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Now, care subdued, and apprehensions gone,"
6626,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,In peace our hero went aspiring on;
6627,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"But short the period--soon a quarrel rose,"
6628,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Fierce in the birth, and fatal in the close;"
6629,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"With times of truce between, which rather proved"
6630,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"That both were weary, than that either loved."
6631,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Fulham e'en now disliked the heavy thrall,"
6632,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And for her death would in his anguish call,"
6633,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"As Rome's mistaken friend exclaimed, 'Let Carthage fall,'"
6634,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"So felt our hero, so his wish express'd,"
6635,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Against this powerful sprite--delenda est:
6636,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Rome in her conquest saw not danger near,"
6637,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Freed from her rival and without a fear;
6638,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"So, Conscience conquer'd, men perceive how free,"
6639,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"But not how fatal, such a state must be."
6640,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Fatal, not free, our hero's; foe or friend,"
6641,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Conscience on him was destined to attend:
6642,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"She dozed indeed, grew dull, nor seem'd to spy"
6643,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Crime following crime, and each of deeper dye;"
6644,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"But all were noticed, and the reckoning time"
6645,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,With her account came on--crime following crime.
6646,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"This, once a foe, now Brother in the Trust,"
6647,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Whom Fulham late described as fair and just,"
6648,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Was the sole Guardian of a wealthy maid,"
6649,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Placed in his power, and of his frown afraid:"
6650,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Not quite an idiot, for her busy brain"
6651,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Sought, by poor cunning, trifling points to gain;"
6652,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Success in childish projects her delight,"
6653,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,She took no heed of each important right.
6654,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"The friendly parties met--the Guardian cried,"
6655,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""I am too old; my sons have each a bride:"
6656,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Martha, my ward, would make an easy wife:"
6657,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,On easy terms I'll make her yours for life;
6658,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And then the creature is so weak and mild.
6659,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"She may be soothed and threaten'd as a child."""
6660,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""Yet not obey,"" said Fulham, ""for your fools,"
6661,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Female and male, are obstinate as mules."""
6662,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Some points adjusted, these new friends agreed,"
6663,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Proposed the day, and hurried on the deed."
6664,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""'Tis a vile act,"" said Conscience. ""It will prove,"""
6665,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Replied the bolder man, ""an act of love:"
6666,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Her wicked guardian might the girl have sold
6667,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,To endless misery for a tyrant's gold;
6668,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Now may her life be happy--for I mean
6669,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"To keep my temper even and serene."""

6673,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Expect my vengeance, or amend your life."""
6674,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"The Wife was pretty, trifling, childish, weak;"
6675,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"She could not think, but would not cease to speak."
6676,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"This he forbade--she took the caution ill,"
6677,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And boldly rose against his sovereign will;
6678,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"With idiot-cunning she would watch the hour,"
6679,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"When friends were present, to dispute his power:"
6680,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"With tyrant-craft, he then was still and calm,"
6681,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,But raised in private terror and alarm:
6682,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"By many trials, she perceived how far"
6683,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"To vex and tease, without an open war;"
6684,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And he discovered that so weak a mind
6685,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"No art could lead, and no compulsion bind;"
6686,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"The rudest force would fail such mind to tame,"
6687,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And she was callous to rebuke and shame;
6688,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Proud of her wealth, the power of law she knew,"
6689,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And would assist him in the spending too:
6690,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"His threat'ning words with insult she defied,"
6691,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,To all his reasoning with a stare replied;
6692,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And when he begg'd her to attend, would say,"
6693,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""Attend I will--but let me have my way."""
6694,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Nor rest had Conscience:  ""While you merit pain"
6695,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"From me,"" she cried, ""you seek redress in vain."""
6696,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"His thoughts were grievous:  ""All that I possess"
6697,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,From this vile bargain adds to my distress;
6698,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"To pass a life with one who will not mend,"
6699,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Who cannot love, nor save, nor wisely spend,"
6700,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Is a vile prospect, and I see no end:"
6701,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"For if we part, I must of course restore"
6702,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Much of her money, and must wed no more."
6703,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""Is there no way?""--Here Conscience rose in power, -"

6706,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Ah, fly this thought, or evil must ensue;"
6707,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Fall on thy knees, and pray with all thy soul,"
6708,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Thy purpose banish, thy design control:"
6709,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Let every hope of such advantage cease,"
6710,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Or never more expect a moment's peace."""
6711,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Th' affrighten'd man a due attention paid,"
6712,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Felt the rebuke, and the command obey'd."
6713,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Again the wife rebell'd, again express'd"
6714,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,A love for pleasure--a contempt of rest;
6715,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""She whom she pleased would visit, would receive"
6716,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Those who pleased her, nor deign to ask for leave."""
6717,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""One way there is,"" said he; ""I might contrive"

6724,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""Mistaken man!"" replied the power within."
6725,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"No guest unnoticed to the lady came,"
6726,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,He judged th' event with mingled joy and shame;
6727,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Oft he withdrew, and seem'd to leave her free,"
6728,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,But still as watchful as a lynx was he;
6729,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Meanwhile the wife was thoughtless, cool, and gay,"
6730,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And, without virtue, had no wish to stray."
6731,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Though thus opposed, his plans were not resign'd;"
6732,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""Revenge,"" said he, ""will prompt that daring mind;"
6733,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Refused supplies, insulted and distress'd,"
6734,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Enraged with me, and near a favourite guest -"
6735,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Then will her vengeance prompt the daring deed,"
6736,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And I shall watch, detect her, and be freed."""
6737,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"There was a youth--but let me hide the name,"
6738,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,With all the progress of this deed of shame;
6739,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,He had his views--on him the husband cast
6740,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"His net, and saw him in his trammels fast."
6741,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""Pause but a moment--think what you intend,"""
6742,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Said the roused Sleeper:  ""I am yet a friend."
6743,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Must all our days in enmity be spent?"""
6744,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"""No!"" and he paused--""I surely shall repent:"""
6745,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Then hurried on--the evil plan was laid,"
6746,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"The wife was guilty, and her friend betray'd,"
6747,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And Fulham gain'd his wish, and for his will was paid."
6748,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Had crimes less weighty on the spirit press'd,"
6749,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,This troubled Conscience might have sunk to rest;
6750,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And, like a foolish guard, been bribed to peace,"
6751,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"By a false promise, that offence should cease;"
6752,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Past faults had seem'd familiar to the view,"
6753,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Confused if many, and obscure though true;"
6754,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And Conscience, troubled with the dull account,"
6755,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Had dropp'd her tale, and slumber'd o'er th' amount:"
6756,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"But, struck by daring guilt, alert she rose,"
6757,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Disturb'd, alarm'd, and could no more repose:"
6758,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"All hopes of friendship and of peace were past,"
6759,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And every view with gloom was overcast.
6760,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Hence from that day, that day of shame and sin,"
6761,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Arose the restless enmity within:
6762,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"On no resource could Fulham now rely,"
6763,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Doom'd all expedients, and in vain, to try;"
6764,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"For Conscience, roused, sat boldly on her throne,"
6765,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Watch'd every thought, attack'd the foe alone,"
6766,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And with envenom'd sting drew forth the inward groan:
6767,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Expedients fail'd that brought relief before,"
6768,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"In vain his alms gave comfort to the poor,"
6769,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Give what he would, to him the comfort came no more:"
6770,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Not prayer avail'd, and when (his crimes confess'd)"
6771,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"He felt some ease, she said, ""Are they redress'd?"
6772,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"You still retain the profit, and be sure,"
6773,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Long as it lasts, this anguish shall endure."""
6774,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Fulham still tried to soothe her, cheat, mislead,"
6775,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"But Conscience laid her finger on the deed,"
6776,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"And read the crime with power, and all that must succeed:"
6777,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"He tried t'expel her, but was sure to find"
6778,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Her strength increased by all that he design'd;
6779,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Nor ever was his groan more loud and deep
6780,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Than when refresh'd she rose from momentary sleep.
6781,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Now desperate grown, weak, harass'd, and afraid,"
6782,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,From new allies he sought for doubtful aid;
6783,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"To thought itself he strove to bid adieu,"
6784,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And from devotions to diversions flew;
6785,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,He took a poor domestic for a slave
6786,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,(Though avarice grieved to see the price he gave);
6787,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Upon his board, once frugal, press'd a load"
6788,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Of viands rich the appetite to goad;
6789,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"The long protracted meal, the sparkling cup,"
6790,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Fought with his gloom, and kept his courage up:"
6791,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Soon as the morning came, there met his eyes"
6792,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Accounts of wealth, that he might reading rise;"
6793,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"To profit then he gave some active hours,"
6794,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Till food and wine again should renovate his powers:
6795,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Yet, spite of all defence, of every aid,"
6796,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,The watchful Foe her close attention paid;
6797,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"In every thoughtful moment on she press'd,"
6798,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And gave at once her dagger to his breast;
6799,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"He waked at midnight, and the fears of sin,"
6800,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"As waters through a bursten dam, broke in;"
6801,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Nay, in the banquet, with his friends around,"
6802,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"When all their cares and half their crimes were drown'd,"
6803,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Would some chance act awake the slumbering fear,"
6804,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And care and crime in all their strength appear:
6805,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"The news is read, a guilty victim swings,"
6806,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And troubled looks proclaim the bosom-stings:
6807,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,Some pair are wed; this brings the wife in view;
6808,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,And some divorced; this shows the parting too:
6809,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Nor can he hear of evil word or deed,"
6810,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"But they to thought, and thought to sufferings lead."
6811,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"Such was his life--no other changes came,"
6812,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"The hurrying day, the conscious night the same;"
6813,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,The night of horror--when he starting cried
6814,THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE.,"To the poor startled sinner at his side,"

7297,THE CONFIDANT.,----------------------
7298,THE CONFIDANT.,
7299,THE CONFIDANT.,Anna was young and lovely--in her eye
7300,THE CONFIDANT.,"The glance of beauty, in her cheek the dye:"
7301,THE CONFIDANT.,"Her shape was slender, and her features small,"
7302,THE CONFIDANT.,"But graceful, easy, unaffected all:"
7303,THE CONFIDANT.,The liveliest tints her youthful face disclosed;
7304,THE CONFIDANT.,"There beauty sparkled, and there health reposed;"
7305,THE CONFIDANT.,For the pure blood that flush'd that rosy cheek
7306,THE CONFIDANT.,"Spoke what the heart forbade the tongue to speak,"
7307,THE CONFIDANT.,"And told the feelings of that heart as well,"
7308,THE CONFIDANT.,"Nay, with more candour than the tongue could tell."
7309,THE CONFIDANT.,"Though this fair lass had with the wealthy dwelt,"
7310,THE CONFIDANT.,Yet like the damsel of the cot she felt;
7311,THE CONFIDANT.,"And, at the distant hint or dark surmise,"
7312,THE CONFIDANT.,The blood into the mantling cheek would rise.
7313,THE CONFIDANT.,"Now Anna's station frequent terrors wrought,"
7314,THE CONFIDANT.,"In one whose looks were with such meaning fraught,"
7315,THE CONFIDANT.,"For on a Lady, as an humble friend,"
7316,THE CONFIDANT.,It was her painful office to attend.
7317,THE CONFIDANT.,Her duties here were of the usual kind -
7318,THE CONFIDANT.,"And some the body harass'd, some the mind:"
7319,THE CONFIDANT.,"Billets she wrote, and tender stories read,"
7320,THE CONFIDANT.,To make the Lady sleepy in her bed;
7321,THE CONFIDANT.,"She play'd at whist, but with inferior skill,"
7322,THE CONFIDANT.,And heard the summons as a call to drill;
7323,THE CONFIDANT.,Music was ever pleasant till she play'd
7324,THE CONFIDANT.,At a request that no request convey'd;
7325,THE CONFIDANT.,"The Lady's tales with anxious looks she heard,"
7326,THE CONFIDANT.,For she must witness what her Friend averr'd;
7327,THE CONFIDANT.,"The Lady's taste she must in all approve,"
7328,THE CONFIDANT.,"Hate whom she hated, whom she lov'd must love;"
7329,THE CONFIDANT.,"These, with the various duties of her place,"
7330,THE CONFIDANT.,"With care she studied, and perform'd with grace:"
7331,THE CONFIDANT.,"She veil'd her troubles in a mask of ease,"
7332,THE CONFIDANT.,And show'd her pleasure was a power to please.
7333,THE CONFIDANT.,Such were the damsel's duties:  she was poor -
7334,THE CONFIDANT.,"Above a servant, but with service more:"
7335,THE CONFIDANT.,"Men on her face with careless freedom gaz'd,"
7336,THE CONFIDANT.,Nor thought how painful was the glow they raised.
7337,THE CONFIDANT.,"A wealthy few to gain her favour tried,"
7338,THE CONFIDANT.,But not the favour of a grateful bride;
7339,THE CONFIDANT.,"They spoke their purpose with an easy air,"
7340,THE CONFIDANT.,That shamed and frighten'd the dependent fair;
7341,THE CONFIDANT.,"Past time she view'd, the passing time to cheat,"
7342,THE CONFIDANT.,But nothing found to make the present sweet:
7343,THE CONFIDANT.,"With pensive soul she read life's future page,"
7344,THE CONFIDANT.,"And saw dependent, poor, repining age."
7345,THE CONFIDANT.,"But who shall dare t'assert what years may bring,"
7346,THE CONFIDANT.,When wonders from the passing hour may spring?
7347,THE CONFIDANT.,"There dwelt a Yeoman in the place, whose mind"
7348,THE CONFIDANT.,"Was gentle, generous, cultivated, kind;"
7349,THE CONFIDANT.,For thirty years he labour'd; fortune then
7350,THE CONFIDANT.,Placed the mild rustic with superior men:
7351,THE CONFIDANT.,"A richer Stafford who had liv'd to save,"
7352,THE CONFIDANT.,What he had treasured to the poorer gave;
7353,THE CONFIDANT.,"Who with a sober mind that treasure view'd,"
7354,THE CONFIDANT.,And the slight studies of his youth renew'd:
7355,THE CONFIDANT.,"He not profoundly, but discreetly read,"
7356,THE CONFIDANT.,And a fair mind with useful culture fed;
7357,THE CONFIDANT.,"Then thought of marriage--""But the great,"" said he"
7358,THE CONFIDANT.,"""I shall not suit, nor will the meaner me."""
7359,THE CONFIDANT.,"Anna, he saw, admired her modest air;"
7360,THE CONFIDANT.,"He thought her virtuous, and he knew her fair;"
7361,THE CONFIDANT.,"Love raised his pity for her humble state,"
7362,THE CONFIDANT.,And prompted wishes for her happier fate;
7363,THE CONFIDANT.,"No pride in money would his feelings wound,"
7364,THE CONFIDANT.,Nor vulgar manners hurt him and confound:
7365,THE CONFIDANT.,"He then the Lady at the Hall address'd,"
7366,THE CONFIDANT.,"Sought her consent, and his regard expressed:"
7367,THE CONFIDANT.,"Yet if some cause his earnest wish denied,"
7368,THE CONFIDANT.,"He begg'd to know it, and he bow'd and sigh'd."
7369,THE CONFIDANT.,"The Lady own'd that she was loth to part,"
7370,THE CONFIDANT.,"But praised the damsel for her gentle heart,"
7371,THE CONFIDANT.,"Her pleasing person, and her blooming health,"
7372,THE CONFIDANT.,"But ended thus, ""Her virtue is her wealth."""
7373,THE CONFIDANT.,"""Then is she rich!"" he cried with lively air;"
7374,THE CONFIDANT.,"""But whence, so please you, came a lass so fair?"""
7375,THE CONFIDANT.,"""A placeman's child was Anna, one who died"
7376,THE CONFIDANT.,And left a widow by afflictions tried;
7377,THE CONFIDANT.,"She to support her infant daughter strove,"
7378,THE CONFIDANT.,But early left the object of her love:
7379,THE CONFIDANT.,"Her youth, her beauty, and her orphan state"
7380,THE CONFIDANT.,Gave a kind countess interest in her fate:
7381,THE CONFIDANT.,"With her she dwelt and still might dwelling be,"
7382,THE CONFIDANT.,When the earl's folly caused the lass to flee;
7383,THE CONFIDANT.,"A second friend was she compell'd to shun,"
7384,THE CONFIDANT.,By the rude offers of an uncheek'd son;
7385,THE CONFIDANT.,"I found her then, and with a mother's love"
7386,THE CONFIDANT.,Regard the gentle girl whom you approve;
7387,THE CONFIDANT.,"Yet e'en with me protection is not peace,"
7388,THE CONFIDANT.,Nor man's designs nor beauty's trials cease:
7389,THE CONFIDANT.,Like sordid boys by costly fruit they feel -
7390,THE CONFIDANT.,"They will not purchase, but they try to steal."""
7391,THE CONFIDANT.,"Now this good Lady, like a witness true,"
7392,THE CONFIDANT.,"Told but the truth, and all the truth she knew;"
7393,THE CONFIDANT.,And 'tis our duty and our pain to show
7394,THE CONFIDANT.,Truth this good lady had not means to know.
7395,THE CONFIDANT.,"Yes, there was lock'd within the damsel's breast"
7396,THE CONFIDANT.,A fact important to be now confess'd;
7397,THE CONFIDANT.,"Gently, my muse, th' afflicting tale relate,"
7398,THE CONFIDANT.,And have some feeling for a sister's fate.
7399,THE CONFIDANT.,"Where Anna dwelt, a conquering hero came, -"
7400,THE CONFIDANT.,"An Irish captain, Sedley was his name;"
7401,THE CONFIDANT.,"And he too had that same prevailing art,"
7402,THE CONFIDANT.,That gave soft wishes to the virgin's heart:
7403,THE CONFIDANT.,In years they differ'd; he had thirty seen
7404,THE CONFIDANT.,When this young beauty counted just fifteen;
7405,THE CONFIDANT.,"But still they were a lovely lively pair,"
7406,THE CONFIDANT.,And trod on earth as if they trod on air.
7407,THE CONFIDANT.,"On love, delightful theme! the captain dwelt"
7408,THE CONFIDANT.,With force still growing with the hopes he felt
7409,THE CONFIDANT.,"But with some caution and reluctance told,"
7410,THE CONFIDANT.,"He had a father crafty, harsh, and old;"
7411,THE CONFIDANT.,"Who, as possessing much, would much expert,"
7412,THE CONFIDANT.,"Or both, for ever, from his love reject:"
7413,THE CONFIDANT.,"Why then offence to one so powerful give,"
7414,THE CONFIDANT.,Who (for their comfort) had not long to live?
7415,THE CONFIDANT.,"With this poor prospect the deluded maid,"
7416,THE CONFIDANT.,"In words confiding, was indeed betray'd;"
7417,THE CONFIDANT.,"And, soon as terrors in her bosom rose,"
7418,THE CONFIDANT.,The hero fled; they hinder'd his repose.
7419,THE CONFIDANT.,"Deprived of him, she to a parent's breast"
7420,THE CONFIDANT.,"Her secret trusted, and her pains impress'd;"
7421,THE CONFIDANT.,"Let her to town (so prudence urged) repair,"
7422,THE CONFIDANT.,"To shun disgrace, at least to hide it there;"
7423,THE CONFIDANT.,"But ere she went, the luckless damsel pray'd"
7424,THE CONFIDANT.,A chosen friend might lend her timely aid:
7425,THE CONFIDANT.,"""Yes! my soul's sister, my Eliza, come,"
7426,THE CONFIDANT.,"Hear her last sigh, and ease thy Anna's doom."""
7427,THE CONFIDANT.,"""'Tis a fool's wish,"" the angry father cried,"
7428,THE CONFIDANT.,"But, lost in troubles of his own, complied;"
7429,THE CONFIDANT.,"And dear Eliza to her friend was sent,"
7430,THE CONFIDANT.,"T'indulge that wish, and be her punishment."
7431,THE CONFIDANT.,"The time arrived, and brought a tenfold dread;"
7432,THE CONFIDANT.,"The time was past, and all the terror fled;"
7433,THE CONFIDANT.,"The infant died; the face resumed each charm,"
7434,THE CONFIDANT.,And reason now brought trouble and alarm.
7435,THE CONFIDANT.,"Should her Eliza--no! she was too just,"
7436,THE CONFIDANT.,"""Too good and kind--but ah! too young to trust."""
7437,THE CONFIDANT.,"Anna return'd, her former place resumed,"
7438,THE CONFIDANT.,And faded beauty with now grace re-bloom'd;
7439,THE CONFIDANT.,"And if some whispers of the past were heard,"
7440,THE CONFIDANT.,"They died innoxious, as no cause appear'd;"
7441,THE CONFIDANT.,"But other cares on Anna's bosom press'd,"
7442,THE CONFIDANT.,She saw her father gloomy and distress'd;
7443,THE CONFIDANT.,"He died o'erwhelmed with debt, and soon was shed"
7444,THE CONFIDANT.,The filial sorrow o'er a mother dead:
7445,THE CONFIDANT.,She sought Eliza's arms--that faithful friend was wed;
7446,THE CONFIDANT.,"Then was compassion by the countess shown,"
7447,THE CONFIDANT.,And all th' adventures of her life are known.
7448,THE CONFIDANT.,"And now, beyond her hopes--no longer tried"
7449,THE CONFIDANT.,By slavish awe--she lived a Yoeman's bride;
7450,THE CONFIDANT.,"Then bless'd her lot, and with a grateful mind"
7451,THE CONFIDANT.,"Was careful, cheerful, vigilant, and kind:"
7452,THE CONFIDANT.,"The gentle husband felt supreme delight,"
7453,THE CONFIDANT.,"Bless'd by her joy, and happy in her sight;"
7454,THE CONFIDANT.,He saw with pride in every friend and guest
7455,THE CONFIDANT.,High admiration and regard express'd:
7456,THE CONFIDANT.,"With greater pride, and with superior joy,"
7457,THE CONFIDANT.,He look'd exulting on his first-born boy;
7458,THE CONFIDANT.,"To her fond breast the wife her infant strain'd,"
7459,THE CONFIDANT.,"Some feelings utter'd, some were not explain'd;"
7460,THE CONFIDANT.,"And she enraptured with her treasure grew,"
7461,THE CONFIDANT.,"The sight familiar, but the pleasure new."
7462,THE CONFIDANT.,Yet there appear'd within that tranquil state
7463,THE CONFIDANT.,Some threat'ning prospect of uncertain fate;
7464,THE CONFIDANT.,"Between the married when a secret lies,"
7465,THE CONFIDANT.,It wakes suspicion from enforced disguise:
7466,THE CONFIDANT.,"Still thought the Wife upon her absent friend,"
7467,THE CONFIDANT.,With all that must upon her truth depend.
7468,THE CONFIDANT.,""" There is no being in the world beside"
7469,THE CONFIDANT.,Who can discover what that friend will hide:
7470,THE CONFIDANT.,"Who knew the fact, knew not my name or state,"
7471,THE CONFIDANT.,Who these can tell cannot the fact relate;
7472,THE CONFIDANT.,"But thou, Eliza, canst the whole impart,"
7473,THE CONFIDANT.,"And all my safety is thy generous heart."""
7474,THE CONFIDANT.,Mix'd with these fears--but light and transient these -
7475,THE CONFIDANT.,"Fled years of peace, prosperity, and ease;"
7476,THE CONFIDANT.,"So tranquil all, that scarce a gloomy day"
7477,THE CONFIDANT.,For days of gloom unmix'd prepared the way:
7478,THE CONFIDANT.,"One eve, the Wife, still happy in her state,"
7479,THE CONFIDANT.,"Sang gaily, thoughtless of approaching fate;"
7480,THE CONFIDANT.,"Then came a letter, that (received in dread"
7481,THE CONFIDANT.,Not unobserved) she in confusion read;
7482,THE CONFIDANT.,"The substance this--""Her friend rejoiced to find"
7483,THE CONFIDANT.,That she had riches with a grateful mind;
7484,THE CONFIDANT.,"While poor Eliza had, from place to place,"
7485,THE CONFIDANT.,Been lured by hope to labour for disgrace;
7486,THE CONFIDANT.,"That every scheme her wandering husband tried,"
7487,THE CONFIDANT.,"Pain'd while he lived, and perish'd when he died."""
7488,THE CONFIDANT.,"She then of want in angry style complain'd,"
7489,THE CONFIDANT.,"Her child a burthen to her life remain'd,"
7490,THE CONFIDANT.,"Her kindred shunn'd her prayers, no friend her soul sustain'd."
7491,THE CONFIDANT.,"""Yet why neglected?  Dearest Anna knew"
7492,THE CONFIDANT.,"Her worth once tried, her friendship ever true;"
7493,THE CONFIDANT.,"She hoped, she trusted, though by wants oppress'd,"
7494,THE CONFIDANT.,To lock the treasured secret in her breast;
7495,THE CONFIDANT.,"Yet, vex'd by trouble, must apply to one,"
7496,THE CONFIDANT.,"For kindness due to her for kindness done."""
7497,THE CONFIDANT.,"In Anna's mind was tumult, in her face"
7498,THE CONFIDANT.,Flushings of dread had momentary place:
7499,THE CONFIDANT.,"""I must,"" she judged, ""these cruel lines expose,"
7500,THE CONFIDANT.,"Or fears, or worse than fears, my crime disclose."""
7501,THE CONFIDANT.,"The letter shown, he said, with sober smile, -"
7502,THE CONFIDANT.,"""Anna, your Friend has not a friendly style:"
7503,THE CONFIDANT.,"Say, where could you with this fair lady dwell,"
7504,THE CONFIDANT.,"Who boasts of secrets that she scorns to tell?"""
7505,THE CONFIDANT.,"""At school,"" she answer'd:  he ""At school!"" replied;"
7506,THE CONFIDANT.,"""Nay, then I know the secrets you would hide;"
7507,THE CONFIDANT.,"Some early longings these, without dispute,"
7508,THE CONFIDANT.,Some youthful gaspings for forbidden fruit:
7509,THE CONFIDANT.,"Why so disorder'd, love? are such the crimes"
7510,THE CONFIDANT.,That give us sorrow in our graver times?
7511,THE CONFIDANT.,"Come, take a present for your friend, and rest"
7512,THE CONFIDANT.,"In perfect peace--you find you are confess'd."""
7513,THE CONFIDANT.,"This cloud, though past, alarm'd the conscious wife,"
7514,THE CONFIDANT.,Presaging gloom and sorrow for her life;
7515,THE CONFIDANT.,Who to her answer join'd a fervent prayer
7516,THE CONFIDANT.,That her Eliza would a sister spare:
7517,THE CONFIDANT.,"If she again--but was there cause?--should send,"
7518,THE CONFIDANT.,Let her direct--and then she named a friend:
7519,THE CONFIDANT.,"A sad expedient untried friends to trust,"
7520,THE CONFIDANT.,And still to fear the tried may be unjust:
7521,THE CONFIDANT.,"Such is his pain, who, by his debt oppress'd,"
7522,THE CONFIDANT.,Seeks by new bonds a temporary rest.
7523,THE CONFIDANT.,Few were her peaceful days till Anna read
7524,THE CONFIDANT.,"The words she dreaded, and had cause to dread:  -"
7525,THE CONFIDANT.,"""Did she believe, did she, unkind, suppose"
7526,THE CONFIDANT.,That thus Eliza's friendship was to close?
7527,THE CONFIDANT.,"No, though she tried, and her desire was plain,"
7528,THE CONFIDANT.,"To break the friendly bond, she strove in vain:"
7529,THE CONFIDANT.,"Ask'd she for silence? why so loud the call,"
7530,THE CONFIDANT.,And yet the token of her love so small?
7531,THE CONFIDANT.,By means like these will you attempt to bind
7532,THE CONFIDANT.,And check the movements of an injured mind?
7533,THE CONFIDANT.,"Poor as I am, I shall be proud to show"
7534,THE CONFIDANT.,What dangerous secrets I may safely know:
7535,THE CONFIDANT.,Secrets to men of jealous minds convey'd
7536,THE CONFIDANT.,Have many a noble house in ruins laid;
7537,THE CONFIDANT.,"Anna, I trust, although with wrongs beset,"
7538,THE CONFIDANT.,"And urged by want, I shall be faithful yet;"
7539,THE CONFIDANT.,"But what temptation may from these arrive,"
7540,THE CONFIDANT.,"To take a slighted woman by surprise,"
7541,THE CONFIDANT.,Becomes a subject for your serious care -
7542,THE CONFIDANT.,"For who offends, must for offence prepare."""
7543,THE CONFIDANT.,"Perplex'd, dismay'd, the Wife foresaw her doom;"
7544,THE CONFIDANT.,A day deferr'd was yet a day to come;
7545,THE CONFIDANT.,"But still, though painful her suspended state,"
7546,THE CONFIDANT.,She dreaded more the crisis of her fate;
7547,THE CONFIDANT.,"Better to die than Stafford's scorn to meet,"
7548,THE CONFIDANT.,And her strange friend perhaps would be discreet.
7549,THE CONFIDANT.,"Presents she sent, and made a strong appeal"
7550,THE CONFIDANT.,"To woman's feelings, begging her to feel;"
7551,THE CONFIDANT.,"With too much force she wrote of jealous men,"
7552,THE CONFIDANT.,And her tears falling spoke beyond the pen;
7553,THE CONFIDANT.,"Eliza's silence she again implored,"
7554,THE CONFIDANT.,And promised all that prudence could afford.
7555,THE CONFIDANT.,For looks composed and careless Anna tried;
7556,THE CONFIDANT.,"She seem'd in trouble, and unconscious sigh'd:"
7557,THE CONFIDANT.,"The faithful Husband, who devoutly loved"
7558,THE CONFIDANT.,"His silent partner, with concern reproved:"
7559,THE CONFIDANT.,"""What secret sorrows on my Anna press,"
7560,THE CONFIDANT.,"That love may not partake, nor care redress?"""
7561,THE CONFIDANT.,"""None, none,"" she answer'd, with a look so kind"
7562,THE CONFIDANT.,That the fond man determined to be blind.
7563,THE CONFIDANT.,A few succeeding weeks of brief repose
7564,THE CONFIDANT.,In Anna's cheek revived the faded rose;
7565,THE CONFIDANT.,"A hue like this the western sky displays,"
7566,THE CONFIDANT.,"That glows awhile, and withers as we gaze."
7567,THE CONFIDANT.,Again the Friend's tormenting letter came -
7568,THE CONFIDANT.,"""The wants she suffer'd were affection's shame;"
7569,THE CONFIDANT.,"She with her child a life of terrors led,"
7570,THE CONFIDANT.,"Unhappy fruit, but of a lawful bed:"
7571,THE CONFIDANT.,"Her friend was tasting every bliss in life,"
7572,THE CONFIDANT.,"The joyful mother, and the wealthy wife;"
7573,THE CONFIDANT.,"While she was placed in doubt, in fear, in want,"
7574,THE CONFIDANT.,To starve on trifles that the happy grant;
7575,THE CONFIDANT.,"Poorly for all her faithful silence paid,"
7576,THE CONFIDANT.,And tantalized by ineffectual aid:
7577,THE CONFIDANT.,She could not thus a beggar's lot endure;
7578,THE CONFIDANT.,She wanted something permanent and sure:
7579,THE CONFIDANT.,"If they were friends, then equal be their lot,"
7580,THE CONFIDANT.,"And she were free to speak if they were not."""
7581,THE CONFIDANT.,"Despair and terror seized the Wife, to find"
7582,THE CONFIDANT.,The artful workings of a vulgar mind:
7583,THE CONFIDANT.,"Money she had not, but the hint of dress"
7584,THE CONFIDANT.,"Taught her new bribes, new terrors to redress;"
7585,THE CONFIDANT.,She with such feeling then described her woes
7586,THE CONFIDANT.,That envy's self might on the view repose;
7587,THE CONFIDANT.,"Then to a mother's pains she made appeal,"
7588,THE CONFIDANT.,And painted grief like one compell'd to feel.
7589,THE CONFIDANT.,"Yes! so she felt, that in her air, her face,"
7590,THE CONFIDANT.,"In every purpose, and in every place,"
7591,THE CONFIDANT.,"In her slow motion, in her languid mien,"
7592,THE CONFIDANT.,"The grief, the sickness of her soul, was seen."
7593,THE CONFIDANT.,"Of some mysterious ill, the Husband sure,"
7594,THE CONFIDANT.,"Desired to trace it, for he hoped to cure;"
7595,THE CONFIDANT.,"Something he knew obscurely, and had seen"
7596,THE CONFIDANT.,His wife attend a cottage on the green;
7597,THE CONFIDANT.,"Love, loth to wound, endured conjecture long,"
7598,THE CONFIDANT.,"Till fear would speak, and spoke in language strong."
7599,THE CONFIDANT.,"""All I must know, my Anna--truly know"
7600,THE CONFIDANT.,"Whence these emotions, terrors, trouble flow:"
7601,THE CONFIDANT.,"Give me thy grief, and I will fairly prove"
7602,THE CONFIDANT.,"Mine is no selfish, no ungenerous love."""
7603,THE CONFIDANT.,"Now Anna's soul the seat of strife became,"
7604,THE CONFIDANT.,"Fear with respect contended, love with shame:"
7605,THE CONFIDANT.,"But fear prevailing was the ruling guide,"
7606,THE CONFIDANT.,Prescribing what to show and what to hide.
7607,THE CONFIDANT.,"""It is my friend,"" she said--""but why disclose"
7608,THE CONFIDANT.,A woman's weakness struggling with her woes?
7609,THE CONFIDANT.,"Yes, she has grieved me by her fond complaints,"
7610,THE CONFIDANT.,"The wrongs she suffers, the distress she paints:"
7611,THE CONFIDANT.,"Something we do--but she afflicts me still,"
7612,THE CONFIDANT.,"And says, with power to help, I want the will;"
7613,THE CONFIDANT.,"This plaintive style I pity and excuse,"
7614,THE CONFIDANT.,"Help when I can, and grieve when I refuse;"
7615,THE CONFIDANT.,"But here my useless sorrows I resign,"
7616,THE CONFIDANT.,"And will be happy in a love like thine."""
7617,THE CONFIDANT.,The Husband doubted:  he was kind but cool:  -
7618,THE CONFIDANT.,"""'Tis a strong friendship to arise at school;"
7619,THE CONFIDANT.,"Once more then, love, once more the sufferer aid, -"
7620,THE CONFIDANT.,"I too can pity, but I must upbraid:"
7621,THE CONFIDANT.,"Of these vain feelings then thy bosom free,"
7622,THE CONFIDANT.,"Nor be o'erwhelm'd by useless sympathy."""
7623,THE CONFIDANT.,"The Wife again despatch'd the useless bribe,"
7624,THE CONFIDANT.,Again essay'd her terrors to describe;
7625,THE CONFIDANT.,"Again with kindest words entreated peace,"
7626,THE CONFIDANT.,And begg'd her offerings for a time might cease.
7627,THE CONFIDANT.,"A calm succeeded, but too like the one"
7628,THE CONFIDANT.,That causes terror ere the storm comes on:
7629,THE CONFIDANT.,"A secret sorrow lived in Anna's heart,"
7630,THE CONFIDANT.,In Stafford's mind a secret fear of art;
7631,THE CONFIDANT.,Not long they lasted--this determined foe
7632,THE CONFIDANT.,"Knew all her claims, and nothing would forego."
7633,THE CONFIDANT.,"Again her letter came, where Anna read,"
7634,THE CONFIDANT.,"""My child, one cause of my distress, is dead:"
7635,THE CONFIDANT.,"Heav'n has my infant.""--""Heartless wretch!"" she cried"
7636,THE CONFIDANT.,"""Is this thy joy?""--""I am no longer tied:"
7637,THE CONFIDANT.,"Now will I, hast'ning to my friend, partake"
7638,THE CONFIDANT.,"Her cares and comforts, and no more forsake;"
7639,THE CONFIDANT.,"Now shall we both in equal station move,"
7640,THE CONFIDANT.,"Save that my friend enjoys a husband's love."""
7641,THE CONFIDANT.,"Complaint and threats so strong the Wife amazed,"
7642,THE CONFIDANT.,Who wildly on her cottage-neighbour gazed;
7643,THE CONFIDANT.,"Her tones, her trembling, first betray'd her grief,"
7644,THE CONFIDANT.,When floods of tears gave anguish its relief.
7645,THE CONFIDANT.,"She fear'd that Stafford would refuse assent,"
7646,THE CONFIDANT.,And knew her selfish Friend would not relent;
7647,THE CONFIDANT.,"She must petition, yet delay'd the task,"
7648,THE CONFIDANT.,"Ashamed, afraid, and yet compell'd to ask;"
7649,THE CONFIDANT.,"Unknown to him some object fill'd her mind,"
7650,THE CONFIDANT.,"And, once suspicious, he became unkind:"
7651,THE CONFIDANT.,"They sat one evening, each absorb'd in gloom,"
7652,THE CONFIDANT.,"When, hark! a noise; and, rushing to the room,"
7653,THE CONFIDANT.,"The Friend tripp'd lightly in, and laughing said, ""I come."""
7654,THE CONFIDANT.,"Anna received her with an anxious mind,"
7655,THE CONFIDANT.,"And meeting whisper'd, ""Is Eliza kind?"""
7656,THE CONFIDANT.,Reserved and cool the Husband sought to prove
7657,THE CONFIDANT.,The depth and force of this mysterious love.
7658,THE CONFIDANT.,To nought that pass'd between the Stranger-friend
7659,THE CONFIDANT.,And his meek partner seem'd he to attend;
7660,THE CONFIDANT.,"But, anxious, listened to the lightest word"
7661,THE CONFIDANT.,"That might some knowledge of his guest afford,"
7662,THE CONFIDANT.,And learn the reason one to him so dear
7663,THE CONFIDANT.,"Should feel such fondness, yet betray such fear."
7664,THE CONFIDANT.,"Soon he perceived this uninvited guest,"
7665,THE CONFIDANT.,"Unwelcome too, a sovereign power possess'd;"
7666,THE CONFIDANT.,"Lofty she was and careless, while the meek"
7667,THE CONFIDANT.,And humbled Anna was afraid to speak:
7668,THE CONFIDANT.,"As mute she listen'd with a painful smile,"
7669,THE CONFIDANT.,"Her friend sat laughing, and at ease the while,"
7670,THE CONFIDANT.,Telling her idle tales with all the glee
7671,THE CONFIDANT.,Of careless and unfeeling levity.
7672,THE CONFIDANT.,"With calm good sense he knew his Wife endued,"
7673,THE CONFIDANT.,And now with wounded pride her conduct view'd;
7674,THE CONFIDANT.,"Her speech was low, her every look convey'd -"
7675,THE CONFIDANT.,"""I am a slave, subservient and afraid."""
7676,THE CONFIDANT.,"All trace of comfort vanish'd; if she spoke,"
7677,THE CONFIDANT.,The noisy friend upon her purpose broke;
7678,THE CONFIDANT.,"To her remarks with insolence replied,"
7679,THE CONFIDANT.,And her assertions doubted or denied:
7680,THE CONFIDANT.,"While the meek Anna like an infant shook,"
7681,THE CONFIDANT.,Woe-struck and trembling at the serpent's look.
7682,THE CONFIDANT.,"""There is,"" said Stafford, ""yes, there is a cause -"
7683,THE CONFIDANT.,"This creature frights her, overpowers, and awes."""
7684,THE CONFIDANT.,"Six weeks had pass'd--""In truth, my love, this friend"
7685,THE CONFIDANT.,Has liberal notions; what does she intend?
7686,THE CONFIDANT.,"Without a hint she came, and will she stay"
7687,THE CONFIDANT.,"Till she receives the hint to go away?"""
7688,THE CONFIDANT.,"Confused the Wife replied, in spite of truth,"
7689,THE CONFIDANT.,"""I love the dear companion of my youth."""
7690,THE CONFIDANT.,"""'Tis well,"" said Stafford; ""then your loves renew:"
7691,THE CONFIDANT.,"Trust me, your rivals, Anna, will be few."""
7692,THE CONFIDANT.,"Though playful this, she felt too much distress'd"
7693,THE CONFIDANT.,T'admit the consolation of a jest.
7694,THE CONFIDANT.,"Ill she reposed, and in her dreams would sigh,"
7695,THE CONFIDANT.,"And, murmuring forth her anguish, beg to die;"
7696,THE CONFIDANT.,"With sunken eye, slow pace, and pallid cheek,"
7697,THE CONFIDANT.,"She look'd confusion, and she fear'd to speak."
7698,THE CONFIDANT.,"All this the Friend beheld, for, quick of sight,"
7699,THE CONFIDANT.,She knew the husband eager for her flight;
7700,THE CONFIDANT.,And that by force alone she could retain
7701,THE CONFIDANT.,The lasting comforts she had hope to gain.
7702,THE CONFIDANT.,"She now perceived, to win her post for life,"
7703,THE CONFIDANT.,She must infuse fresh terrors in the wife;
7704,THE CONFIDANT.,"Must bid to friendship's feebler ties adieu,"
7705,THE CONFIDANT.,And boldly claim the object in her view:
7706,THE CONFIDANT.,"She saw the husband's love, and knew the power"
7707,THE CONFIDANT.,Her friend might use in some propitious hour.
7708,THE CONFIDANT.,"Meantime the anxious Wife, from pure distress"
7709,THE CONFIDANT.,"Assuming courage, said, ""I will confess;"""
7710,THE CONFIDANT.,"But with her children felt a parent's pride,"
7711,THE CONFIDANT.,And sought once more the hated truth to hide.
7712,THE CONFIDANT.,"Offended, grieved, impatient, Stafford bore"
7713,THE CONFIDANT.,"The odious change, till he could bear no more:"
7714,THE CONFIDANT.,"A friend to truth, in speech and action plain,"
7715,THE CONFIDANT.,He held all fraud and cunning in disdain;
7716,THE CONFIDANT.,"But fraud to find, and falsehood to detect,"
7717,THE CONFIDANT.,For once he fled to measures indirect.
7718,THE CONFIDANT.,One day the Friends were seated in that room
7719,THE CONFIDANT.,"The Guest with care adorn'd, and named her home."
7720,THE CONFIDANT.,"To please the eye, there curious prints were placed,"
7721,THE CONFIDANT.,And some light volumes to amuse the taste;
7722,THE CONFIDANT.,"Letters and music on a table laid,"
7723,THE CONFIDANT.,The favourite studies of the fair betray'd;
7724,THE CONFIDANT.,"Beneath the window was the toilet spread,"
7725,THE CONFIDANT.,And the fire gleam'd upon a crimson bed.
7726,THE CONFIDANT.,In Anna's looks and falling tears were seen
7727,THE CONFIDANT.,How interesting had their subjects been:
7728,THE CONFIDANT.,"""Oh! then,"" resumed the Friend, ""I plainly find"
7729,THE CONFIDANT.,That you and Stafford know each other's mind;
7730,THE CONFIDANT.,"I must depart, must on the world be thrown,"
7731,THE CONFIDANT.,"Like one discarded, worthless, and unknown;"
7732,THE CONFIDANT.,"But, shall I carry, and to please a foe,"
7733,THE CONFIDANT.,A painful secret in my bosom?  No!
7734,THE CONFIDANT.,Think not your Friend a reptile you may tread
7735,THE CONFIDANT.,"Beneath your feet, and say, the worm is dead;"
7736,THE CONFIDANT.,"I have some feeling, and will not be made"
7737,THE CONFIDANT.,The scorn of her whom love cannot persuade:
7738,THE CONFIDANT.,"Would not your word, your slightest wish, effect"
7739,THE CONFIDANT.,"All that I hope, petition, or expect?"
7740,THE CONFIDANT.,"The power you have, but you the use decline -"
7741,THE CONFIDANT.,"Proof that you feel not, or you fear not mine."
7742,THE CONFIDANT.,"There was a time when I, a tender maid,"
7743,THE CONFIDANT.,"Flew at a call, and your desires obey'd;"
7744,THE CONFIDANT.,"A very mother to the child became,"
7745,THE CONFIDANT.,"Consoled your sorrow, and conceal'd your shame;"
7746,THE CONFIDANT.,"But now, grown rich and happy, from the door"
7747,THE CONFIDANT.,"You thrust a bosom-friend, despised and poor;"
7748,THE CONFIDANT.,"That child alive, its mother might have known"
7749,THE CONFIDANT.,"The hard, ungrateful spirit she had shown."""
7750,THE CONFIDANT.,"Here paused the Guest, and Anna cried at length -"
7751,THE CONFIDANT.,"""You try me, cruel friend! beyond my strength;"
7752,THE CONFIDANT.,"Would I had been beside my infant laid,"
7753,THE CONFIDANT.,"Where none would vex me, threaten, or upbraid!"""
7754,THE CONFIDANT.,In Anna's looks the Friend beheld despair;
7755,THE CONFIDANT.,"Her speech she soften'd, and composed her air;"
7756,THE CONFIDANT.,"Yet, while professing love, she answer'd still -"
7757,THE CONFIDANT.,"""You can befriend me, but you want the will."""
7758,THE CONFIDANT.,"They parted thus, and Anna went her way,"
7759,THE CONFIDANT.,"To shed her secret sorrows, and to pray."
7760,THE CONFIDANT.,"Stafford, amused with books, and fond of home,"
7761,THE CONFIDANT.,By reading oft dispell'd the evening gloom;
7762,THE CONFIDANT.,"History or tale--all heard him with delight,"
7763,THE CONFIDANT.,And thus was pass'd this memorable night.
7764,THE CONFIDANT.,The listening Friend bestow'd a flattering smile:
7765,THE CONFIDANT.,A sleeping boy the mother held the while;
7766,THE CONFIDANT.,"And ere she fondly bore him to his bed,"
7767,THE CONFIDANT.,On his fair face the tear of anguish shed.
7768,THE CONFIDANT.,"And now his task resumed, ""My tale,"" said he,"
7769,THE CONFIDANT.,"""Is short and sad, short may our sadness be!"""
7770,THE CONFIDANT.,"""The Caliph Harun, as historians tell, {5}"
7771,THE CONFIDANT.,"Ruled, for a tyrant, admirably well;"
7772,THE CONFIDANT.,"Where his own pleasures were not touch'd, to men"
7773,THE CONFIDANT.,"He was humane, and sometimes even then."
7774,THE CONFIDANT.,"Harun was fond of fruits and gardens fair,"
7775,THE CONFIDANT.,And woe to all whom he found poaching there:
7776,THE CONFIDANT.,"Among his pages was a lively Boy,"
7777,THE CONFIDANT.,Eager in search of every trifling joy;
7778,THE CONFIDANT.,"His feelings vivid, and his fancy strong,"
7779,THE CONFIDANT.,He sigh'd for pleasure while he shrank from wrong:
7780,THE CONFIDANT.,"When by the Caliph in the garden placed,"
7781,THE CONFIDANT.,He saw the treasures which he long'd to taste;
7782,THE CONFIDANT.,And oft alone he ventured to behold
7783,THE CONFIDANT.,Rich hanging fruits with rind of glowing gold;
7784,THE CONFIDANT.,"Too long he stay'd forbidden bliss to view,"
7785,THE CONFIDANT.,His virtue failing as his longings grew;
7786,THE CONFIDANT.,"Athirst and wearied with the noontide heat,"
7787,THE CONFIDANT.,Fate to the garden led his luckless feet;
7788,THE CONFIDANT.,"With eager eyes and open mouth he stood,"
7789,THE CONFIDANT.,"Smelt the sweet breath, and touch'd the fragrant food;"
7790,THE CONFIDANT.,The tempting beauty sparkling in the sun
7791,THE CONFIDANT.,"Charm'd his young sense--he ate, and was undone;"
7792,THE CONFIDANT.,"When the fond glutton paused, his eyes around"
7793,THE CONFIDANT.,"He turn'd, and eyes upon him turning found;"
7794,THE CONFIDANT.,"Pleased he beheld the spy, a brother-page."
7795,THE CONFIDANT.,A friend allied in office and in age;
7796,THE CONFIDANT.,"Who promised much that secret he would be,"
7797,THE CONFIDANT.,But high the price he fix'd in secrecy:
7798,THE CONFIDANT.,"""'Were you suspected, my unhappy friend,'"
7799,THE CONFIDANT.,"Began the boy, 'where would your sorrows end?"
7800,THE CONFIDANT.,In all the palace there is not a page
7801,THE CONFIDANT.,The Caliph would not torture in his rage:
7802,THE CONFIDANT.,"I think I see thee now impaled alive,"
7803,THE CONFIDANT.,"Writhing in pangs--but come, my friend! revive;"
7804,THE CONFIDANT.,"Had some beheld you, all your purse contains"
7805,THE CONFIDANT.,Could not have saved you from terrific pains;
7806,THE CONFIDANT.,"I scorn such meanness; and, if not in debt,"
7807,THE CONFIDANT.,Would not an asper on your folly set.'
7808,THE CONFIDANT.,"""The hint was strong; young Osmyn search'd his store"
7809,THE CONFIDANT.,"For bribes, and found he soon could bribe no more;"
7810,THE CONFIDANT.,"That time arrived, for Osmyn's stock was small,"
7811,THE CONFIDANT.,And the young tyrant now possess'd it all;
7812,THE CONFIDANT.,"The cruel youth, with his companions near,"
7813,THE CONFIDANT.,Gave the broad hint that raised the sudden fear;
7814,THE CONFIDANT.,"Th' ungenerous insult now was daily shown,"
7815,THE CONFIDANT.,And Osmyn's peace and honest pride were flown;
7816,THE CONFIDANT.,"Then came augmenting woes, and fancy strong"
7817,THE CONFIDANT.,"Drew forms of suffering, a tormenting throng;"
7818,THE CONFIDANT.,"He felt degraded, and the struggling mind"
7819,THE CONFIDANT.,"Dared not be free, and could not be resign'd;"
7820,THE CONFIDANT.,And all his pains and fervent prayers obtain'd
7821,THE CONFIDANT.,"Was truce from insult, while the fears remain'd."
7822,THE CONFIDANT.,"""One day it chanced that this degraded Boy"
7823,THE CONFIDANT.,And tyrant-friend were fixed at their employ;
7824,THE CONFIDANT.,"Who now had thrown restraint and form aside,"
7825,THE CONFIDANT.,And for his bribe in plainer speech applied:
7826,THE CONFIDANT.,"'Long have I waited, and the last supply"
7827,THE CONFIDANT.,"Was but a pittance, yet how patient I!"
7828,THE CONFIDANT.,"But give me now what thy first terrors gave,"

7847,THE CONFIDANT.,"Far from his notice, favour, or employ;"

8013,RESENTMENT.,"She liked his manners, and believed his word;"
8014,RESENTMENT.,"He did not flatter, flattery she abhorr'd:"
8015,RESENTMENT.,It was her happy lot in peace to dwell -
8016,RESENTMENT.,Would change make better what was now so well?
8017,RESENTMENT.,"But she would ponder.""  ""This,"" he said, ""was kind;"""
8018,RESENTMENT.,"And begg'd to know ""when she had fix'd her mind."
8019,RESENTMENT.,"Romantic maidens would have scorn'd the air,"
8020,RESENTMENT.,And the cool prudence of a mind so fair;
8021,RESENTMENT.,But well it pleased this wiser maid to find
8022,RESENTMENT.,Her own mild virtues in her lover's mind.
8023,RESENTMENT.,"His worldly wealth she sought, and quickly grew"
8024,RESENTMENT.,"Pleased with her search, and happy in the view"
8025,RESENTMENT.,"Of vessels freighted with abundant stores,"
8026,RESENTMENT.,Of rooms whose treasures press'd the groaning floors;
8027,RESENTMENT.,And he of clerks and servants could display
8028,RESENTMENT.,A little army on a public day:
8029,RESENTMENT.,Was this a man like needy bard to speak
8030,RESENTMENT.,"Of balmy lip, bright eye, or rosy cheek?"
8031,RESENTMENT.,"The sum appointed for her widow'd state,"
8032,RESENTMENT.,"Fix'd by her friend, excited no debate;"

8034,RESENTMENT.,"And, never finding, never dealt with art:"
8035,RESENTMENT.,In his engagements she had no concern;
8036,RESENTMENT.,"He taught her not, nor had she wish to learn;"
8037,RESENTMENT.,"On him in all occasions she relied,"
8038,RESENTMENT.,"His word her surety, and his worth her pride."
8039,RESENTMENT.,"When ship was launch'd, and merchant Paul had share,"
8040,RESENTMENT.,A bounteous feast became the lady's care;

8042,RESENTMENT.,"In costly raiment, and with kind parade."
8043,RESENTMENT.,"Call'd by this duty on a certain day,"
8044,RESENTMENT.,"And robed to grace it in a rich array,"
8045,RESENTMENT.,"Forth from her room, with measured step she came,"
8046,RESENTMENT.,"Proud of th' event, and stately look'd the dame;"
8047,RESENTMENT.,The husband met her at his study door -
8048,RESENTMENT.,"""This way, my love--one moment, and no more:"

8052,RESENTMENT.,"Why forms like these have been prescribed by laws."""
8053,RESENTMENT.,"Then from his chair a man in black arose,"
8054,RESENTMENT.,And with much quickness hurried off his prose -
8055,RESENTMENT.,"That ""Ellen Paul, the wife, and so forth, freed"

8057,RESENTMENT.,"And forasmuch""--said she, ""I've no distrust,"
8058,RESENTMENT.,For he that asks it is discreet and just;
8059,RESENTMENT.,Our friends are waiting--where am I to sign? -
8060,RESENTMENT.,"There?--Now be ready when we meet to dine."""
8061,RESENTMENT.,"This said, she hurried off in great delight,"
8062,RESENTMENT.,"The ship was launch'd, and joyful was the night."
8063,RESENTMENT.,"Now, says the reader, and in much disdain,"
8064,RESENTMENT.,This serious Merchant was a rogue in grain;
8065,RESENTMENT.,"A treacherous wretch, an artful sober knave,"
8066,RESENTMENT.,And ten times worse for manners cool and grave:

8069,RESENTMENT.,Alas! 'tis true; and I in vain had tried
8070,RESENTMENT.,To soften crime that cannot be denied;

8074,RESENTMENT.,This Trader view'd a huge accompting-book;
8075,RESENTMENT.,(His former marriage for a time delay'd

8077,RESENTMENT.,"But he too clearly saw the evil day,"
8078,RESENTMENT.,"And put the terror, by deceit, away;"
8079,RESENTMENT.,"Thus, by connecting with his sorrows crime,"
8080,RESENTMENT.,He gain'd a portion of uneasy time. -
8081,RESENTMENT.,All this too late the injur'd Lady saw:
8082,RESENTMENT.,"What law had given, again she gave to law;"

8086,RESENTMENT.,"But will not see this guilty wretch again:"""
8087,RESENTMENT.,"For all was lost, and he with many a tear"
8088,RESENTMENT.,Confess'd the fault--she turning scorn'd to hear.
8089,RESENTMENT.,To legal claims he yielded all his worth.
8090,RESENTMENT.,"But small the portion, and the wrong'd were wroth,"
8091,RESENTMENT.,Nor to their debtor would a part allow;

8119,RESENTMENT.,And vile expressions shock me and confound:
8120,RESENTMENT.,"Noise of dull wheels, and songs with horrid words,"
8121,RESENTMENT.,Will be the music that this lane affords;

8144,RESENTMENT.,"Frugal and rich the man, and frugal grew"
8145,RESENTMENT.,The sister-mind without a selfish view;
8146,RESENTMENT.,And further still--the temp'rate pair agreed

8156,RESENTMENT.,"The absent sick were soothed by her relief,"
8157,RESENTMENT.,As her free bounty sought the haunts of grief;
8158,RESENTMENT.,"A plain and homely charity had she,"
8159,RESENTMENT.,And loved the objects of her alms to see;
8160,RESENTMENT.,"With her own hands she dress'd the savoury meat,"
8161,RESENTMENT.,With her own fingers wrote the choice receipt;
8162,RESENTMENT.,"She heard all tales that injured wives relate,"

8195,RESENTMENT.,No better husband would be left alive:
8196,RESENTMENT.,"For him she mourn'd, and then, alone and poor,"
8197,RESENTMENT.,Sought and found comfort at her Lady's door:
8198,RESENTMENT.,"Ten years she served, and mercy her employ,"
8199,RESENTMENT.,"Her tasks were pleasure, and her duty joy."
8200,RESENTMENT.,"Thus lived the Mistress and the Maid, design'd"
8201,RESENTMENT.,"Each other's aid--one cautious, and both kind:"
8202,RESENTMENT.,"Oft at their window, working, they would sigh"
8203,RESENTMENT.,To see the aged and the sick go by;
8204,RESENTMENT.,"Like wounded bees, that at their home arrive"
8205,RESENTMENT.,"Slowly and weak, but labouring for the hive."
8206,RESENTMENT.,The busy people of a mason's yard
8207,RESENTMENT.,The curious Lady view'd with much regard;
8208,RESENTMENT.,With steady motion she perceived them draw
8209,RESENTMENT.,Through blocks of stone the slowly-working saw;
8210,RESENTMENT.,It gave her pleasure and surprise to see
8211,RESENTMENT.,Among these men the signs of revelry:
8212,RESENTMENT.,"Cold was the season, and confined their view,"
8213,RESENTMENT.,"Tedious their tasks, but merry were the crew;"
8214,RESENTMENT.,"There she beheld an aged pauper wait,"
8215,RESENTMENT.,"Patient and still, to take an humble freight;"
8216,RESENTMENT.,Within the panniers on an ass he laid
8217,RESENTMENT.,"The ponderous grit, and for the portion paid;"
8218,RESENTMENT.,"This he re-sold, and, with each trifling gift,"
8219,RESENTMENT.,"Made shift to live, and wretched was the shift."
8220,RESENTMENT.,Now will it be by every reader told
8221,RESENTMENT.,"Who was this humble trader, poor and old. -"
8222,RESENTMENT.,"In vain an author would a name suppress,"
8223,RESENTMENT.,From the least hint a reader learns to guess;
8224,RESENTMENT.,"Of children lost, our novels sometimes treat,"
8225,RESENTMENT.,We never care--assured again to meet:
8226,RESENTMENT.,"In vain the writer for concealment tries,"
8227,RESENTMENT.,We trace his purpose under all disguise;
8228,RESENTMENT.,"Nay, though he tells us they are dead and gone,"
8229,RESENTMENT.,"Of whom we wot, they will appear anon;"
8230,RESENTMENT.,"Our favourites fight, are wounded, hopeless lie,"
8231,RESENTMENT.,"Survive they cannot--nay, they cannot die;"
8232,RESENTMENT.,"Now, as these tricks and stratagems are known,"
8233,RESENTMENT.,"'Tis best, at once, the simple truth to own."
8234,RESENTMENT.,This was the husband--in an humble shed
8235,RESENTMENT.,"He nightly slept, and daily sought his bread:"
8236,RESENTMENT.,Once for relief the weary man applied;
8237,RESENTMENT.,"""Your wife is rich,"" the angry vestry cried:"
8238,RESENTMENT.,"Alas! he dared not to his wife complain,"
8239,RESENTMENT.,"Feeling her wrongs, and fearing her disdain:"
8240,RESENTMENT.,"By various methods he had tried to live,"
8241,RESENTMENT.,But not one effort would subsistence give:
8242,RESENTMENT.,"He was an usher in a school, till noise"
8243,RESENTMENT.,Made him less able than the weaker boys;
8244,RESENTMENT.,"On messages he went, till he in vain"
8245,RESENTMENT.,"Strove names, or words, or meanings to retain;"
8246,RESENTMENT.,"Each small employment in each neighbouring town,"
8247,RESENTMENT.,"By turn he took, to lay as quickly down:"
8248,RESENTMENT.,"For, such his fate, he fail'd in all he plann'd,"
8249,RESENTMENT.,And nothing prosper'd in his luckless hand.
8250,RESENTMENT.,"At his old home, his motive half suppress'd,"
8251,RESENTMENT.,"He sought no more for riches, but for rest:"
8252,RESENTMENT.,"There lived the bounteous Wife, and at her gate"
8253,RESENTMENT.,He saw in cheerful groups the needy wait;
8254,RESENTMENT.,"""Had he a right with bolder hope t'apply?"""
8255,RESENTMENT.,"He ask'd--was answer'd, and went groaning by:"
8256,RESENTMENT.,"For some remains of spirit, temper, pride,"
8257,RESENTMENT.,Forbade a prayer he knew would be denied.
8258,RESENTMENT.,"Thus was the grieving man, with burthen'd ass,"
8259,RESENTMENT.,Seen day by day along the street to pass:
8260,RESENTMENT.,"""Who is he, Susan? who the poor old man?"
8261,RESENTMENT.,"He never calls--do make him, if you can."""
8262,RESENTMENT.,"The conscious damsel still delay'd to speak,"
8263,RESENTMENT.,"She stopp'd confused, and had her words to seek;"
8264,RESENTMENT.,"From Susan's fears the fact her mistress knew,"
8265,RESENTMENT.,"And cried--""The wretch! what scheme has he in view?"
8266,RESENTMENT.,"Is this his lot?--but let him, let him feel -"
8267,RESENTMENT.,"Who wants the courage, not the will, to steal."""
8268,RESENTMENT.,"A dreadful winter came, each day severe,"
8269,RESENTMENT.,"Misty when mild, and icy cold when clear;"
8270,RESENTMENT.,"And still the humble dealer took his load,"
8271,RESENTMENT.,"Returning slow, and shivering on the road:"
8272,RESENTMENT.,"The Lady, still relentless, saw him come,"
8273,RESENTMENT.,"And said--""I wonder, has the wretch a home?"" -"
8274,RESENTMENT.,"""A hut! a hovel!""  ""Then his fate appears"
8275,RESENTMENT.,"To suit his crime.""--""Yes, lady, not his years; -"
8276,RESENTMENT.,"No! nor his sufferings--nor that form decay'd."""
8277,RESENTMENT.,"""Well! let the parish give its paupers aid:"
8278,RESENTMENT.,"You must the vileness of his acts allow."" -"
8279,RESENTMENT.,"""And you, dear lady, that he feels it now."""
8280,RESENTMENT.,"""When such dissemblers on their deeds reflect,"
8281,RESENTMENT.,Can they the pity they refused expect?
8282,RESENTMENT.,"He that doth evil, evil shall he dread."" -"
8283,RESENTMENT.,"""The snow,"" quoth Susan, ""falls upon his bed -"
8284,RESENTMENT.,"It blows beside the thatch--it melts upon his head."""
8285,RESENTMENT.,"""Tis weakness, child, for grieving guilt to feel."" -"
8286,RESENTMENT.,"""Yes, but he never sees a wholesome meal;"
8287,RESENTMENT.,"Through his bare dress appears his shrivell'd skin,"
8288,RESENTMENT.,"And ill he fares without, and worse within:"
8289,RESENTMENT.,"With that weak body, lame, diseased, and slow,"
8290,RESENTMENT.,"What cold, pain, peril, must the sufferer know!"""
8291,RESENTMENT.,"""Think on his crime.""--""Yes, sure 'twas very wrong;"
8292,RESENTMENT.,"But look (God bless him!) how he gropes along."""
8293,RESENTMENT.,"""Brought me to shame.""--Oh! yes, I know it all -"
8294,RESENTMENT.,What cutting blast! and he can scarcely crawl:
8295,RESENTMENT.,He freezes as he moves--he dies! if he should fall:
8296,RESENTMENT.,With cruel fierceness drives this icy sleet -
8297,RESENTMENT.,"And must a Christian perish in the street,"
8298,RESENTMENT.,"In sight of Christians?--There! at last, he lies; -"
8299,RESENTMENT.,Nor unsupported can he ever rise:
8300,RESENTMENT.,"He cannot live.""  ""But is he fit to die?"" -"
8301,RESENTMENT.,"Here Susan softly mutter'd a reply,"
8302,RESENTMENT.,"Look'd round the room--said something of its state,"
8303,RESENTMENT.,"Dives the rich, and Lazarus at his gate;"
8304,RESENTMENT.,"And then aloud--""In pity do behold"
8305,RESENTMENT.,"The man affrighten'd, weeping, trembling, cold:"
8306,RESENTMENT.,Oh! how those flakes of snow their entrance win
8307,RESENTMENT.,"Through the poor rags, and keep the frost within."
8308,RESENTMENT.,"His very heart seems frozen as he goes,"
8309,RESENTMENT.,Leading that starved companion of his woes:
8310,RESENTMENT.,"He tried to pray--his lips, I saw them move,"
8311,RESENTMENT.,And he so turn'd his piteous looks above;
8312,RESENTMENT.,"But the fierce wind the willing heart opposed,"
8313,RESENTMENT.,"And, ere he spoke, the lips in misery closed:"
8314,RESENTMENT.,"Poor suffering object! yes, for ease you pray'd,"
8315,RESENTMENT.,"And God will hear--He only, I'm afraid."""
8316,RESENTMENT.,"""Peace! Susan, peace! pain ever follows sin."" -"
8317,RESENTMENT.,"""Ah! then,"" thought Susan, ""when will ours begin?"
8318,RESENTMENT.,"When reach'd his home, to what a cheerless fire"
8319,RESENTMENT.,And chilling bed will those cold limbs retire!
8320,RESENTMENT.,"Yet ragged, wretched as it is, that bed"
8321,RESENTMENT.,Takes half the space of his contracted shed;
8322,RESENTMENT.,"I saw the thorns beside the narrow grate,"
8323,RESENTMENT.,With straw collected in a putrid state:
8324,RESENTMENT.,"There will he, kneeling, strive the fire to raise,"
8325,RESENTMENT.,"And that will warm him, rather than the blaze:"
8326,RESENTMENT.,"The sullen, smoky blaze, that cannot last"
8327,RESENTMENT.,One moment after his attempt is past;
8328,RESENTMENT.,"And I so warmly and so purely laid,"
8329,RESENTMENT.,"To sink to rest--indeed, I am afraid."""
8330,RESENTMENT.,"""Know you his conduct?""--""Yes, indeed I know,"
8331,RESENTMENT.,And how he wanders in the wind and snow;
8332,RESENTMENT.,"Safe in our rooms the threat'ning storm we hear,"
8333,RESENTMENT.,"But he feels strongly what we faintly fear."""
8334,RESENTMENT.,"""Wilful was rich, and he the storm defied;"
8335,RESENTMENT.,"Wilful is poor, and must the storm abide,"""
8336,RESENTMENT.,"Said the stern Lady; ""'tis in vain to feel;"
8337,RESENTMENT.,"Go and prepare the chicken for our meal."""
8338,RESENTMENT.,"Susan her task reluctantly began,"
8339,RESENTMENT.,"And utter'd as she went--""The poor old man!"""
8340,RESENTMENT.,But while her soft and ever-yielding heart
8341,RESENTMENT.,"Made strong protest against her lady's part,"
8342,RESENTMENT.,The lady's self began to think it wrong
8343,RESENTMENT.,To feel so wrathful and resent so long.
8344,RESENTMENT.,"""No more the wretch would she receive again,"
8345,RESENTMENT.,No more behold him--but she would sustain;
8346,RESENTMENT.,"Great his offence, and evil was his mind -"
8347,RESENTMENT.,"But he had suffer'd, and she would be kind:"
8348,RESENTMENT.,"She spurn'd such baseness, and she found within"
8349,RESENTMENT.,A fair acquittal from so foul a sin;
8350,RESENTMENT.,"Yet she too err'd, and must of Heaven expect"
8351,RESENTMENT.,"To be rejected, him should she reject."""
8352,RESENTMENT.,"Susan was summon'd--""I'm about to do"
8353,RESENTMENT.,"A foolish act, in part seduced by you;"
8354,RESENTMENT.,"Go to the creature--say that I intend,"
8355,RESENTMENT.,"Foe to his sins, to be his sorrow's friend:"
8356,RESENTMENT.,"Take, for his present comforts, food and wine,"
8357,RESENTMENT.,And mark his feelings at this act of mine:
8358,RESENTMENT.,"Observe if shame be o'er his features spread,"
8359,RESENTMENT.,By his own victim to be soothed and fed;
8360,RESENTMENT.,"But, this inform him, that it is not love"
8361,RESENTMENT.,"That prompts my heart, that duties only move."
8362,RESENTMENT.,"Say, that no merits in his favour plead,"
8363,RESENTMENT.,"But miseries only, and his abject need;"
8364,RESENTMENT.,"Nor bring me grov'ling thanks, nor high-flown praise;"
8365,RESENTMENT.,"I would his spirits, not his fancy, raise:"
8366,RESENTMENT.,Give him no hope that I shall ever more
8367,RESENTMENT.,A man so vile to my esteem restore;
8368,RESENTMENT.,"But warn him rather, that, in time of rest,"
8369,RESENTMENT.,His crimes be all remember'd and confess'd:
8370,RESENTMENT.,"I know not all that form the sinner's debt,"
8371,RESENTMENT.,"But there is one that he must not forget."""
8372,RESENTMENT.,The mind of Susan prompted her with speed
8373,RESENTMENT.,To act her part in every courteous deed:
8374,RESENTMENT.,"All that was kind she was prepared to say,"
8375,RESENTMENT.,And keep the lecture for a future day;
8376,RESENTMENT.,"When he had all life's comforts by his side,"
8377,RESENTMENT.,"Pity might sleep, and good advice be tried."
8378,RESENTMENT.,"This done, the mistress felt disposed to look,"
8379,RESENTMENT.,"As self-approving, on a pious book;"
8380,RESENTMENT.,"Yet, to her native bias still inclined,"
8381,RESENTMENT.,She felt her act too merciful and kind;
8382,RESENTMENT.,"But when, long musing on the chilling scene"
8383,RESENTMENT.,So lately past--the frost and sleet so keen -
8384,RESENTMENT.,The man's whole misery in a single view -
8385,RESENTMENT.,Yes! she could think some pity was his due.
8386,RESENTMENT.,"Thus fix'd, she heard not her attendant glide"
8387,RESENTMENT.,"With soft slow step--till, standing by her side,"
8388,RESENTMENT.,"The trembling servant gasp'd for breath, and shed"
8389,RESENTMENT.,"Relieving tears, then utter'd, ""He is dead!"""
8390,RESENTMENT.,"""Dead!"" said the startled Lady.--""Yes, he fell"
8391,RESENTMENT.,Close at the door where he was wont to dwell;
8392,RESENTMENT.,"There his sole friend, the Ass, was standing by,"
8393,RESENTMENT.,"Half dead himself, to see his Master die."""
8394,RESENTMENT.,"""Expired he then, good Heaven! for want of food?"" -"
8395,RESENTMENT.,"""No! crusts and water in a corner stood:  -"
8396,RESENTMENT.,"To have this plenty, and to wait so long,"
8397,RESENTMENT.,"And to be right too late, is doubly wrong:"
8398,RESENTMENT.,"Then, every day to see him totter by,"
8399,RESENTMENT.,"And to forbear--Oh! what a heart had I!"""
8400,RESENTMENT.,"""Blame me not, child; I tremble at the news."""
8401,RESENTMENT.,"""Tis my own heart,"" said Susan, ""I accuse:"
8402,RESENTMENT.,To have this money in my purse--to know
8403,RESENTMENT.,"What grief was his, and what to grief we owe;"
8404,RESENTMENT.,"To see him often, always to conceive"
8405,RESENTMENT.,"How he must pine and languish, groan and grieve,"
8406,RESENTMENT.,"And every day in ease and peace to dine,"
8407,RESENTMENT.,"And rest in comfort!--What a heart is mine!"""

8432,THE WAGER.,"Counter and Clubb were men in trade, whose pains,"
8433,THE WAGER.,"Credit, and prudence, brought them constant gains;"
8434,THE WAGER.,"Partners and punctual, every friend agreed"
8435,THE WAGER.,Counter and Clubb were men who must succeed.
8436,THE WAGER.,"When they had fix'd some little time in life,"
8437,THE WAGER.,Each thought of taking to himself a wife:
8438,THE WAGER.,"As men in trade alike, as men in love,"
8439,THE WAGER.,They seem'd with no according views to move;
8440,THE WAGER.,"As certain ores in outward view the same,"
8441,THE WAGER.,They show'd their difference when the magnet came.
8442,THE WAGER.,"Counter was vain:  with spirit strong and high,"
8443,THE WAGER.,'Twas not in him like suppliant swain to sigh:
8444,THE WAGER.,"""His wife might o'er his men and maids preside,"

8462,THE WAGER.,How is he certain such a prize to gain?
8463,THE WAGER.,"What he approves, a lass may learn to feign,"
8464,THE WAGER.,And so affect t'obey till she begins to reign;
8465,THE WAGER.,"A while complying, she may vary then,"
8466,THE WAGER.,And be as wives of more unwary men;
8467,THE WAGER.,"Beside, to him who plays such lordly part,"
8468,THE WAGER.,How shall a tender creature yield her heart;
8469,THE WAGER.,"Should he the promised confidence refuse,"

8477,THE WAGER.,"Clubb, with these notions, cast his eye around;"
8478,THE WAGER.,And one so easy soon a partner found.
8479,THE WAGER.,The lady chosen was of good repute;
8480,THE WAGER.,"Meekness she had not, and was seldom mute;"
8481,THE WAGER.,"Though quick to anger, still she loved to smile,"
8482,THE WAGER.,And would be calm if men would wait a while:
8483,THE WAGER.,"She knew her duty, and she loved her way,"
8484,THE WAGER.,More pleased in truth to govern than obey;
8485,THE WAGER.,"She heard her priest with reverence, and her spouse"

8489,THE WAGER.,Though some indeed a sly remark would make -

8491,THE WAGER.,"All this, when Clubb some cheerful months had spent,"
8492,THE WAGER.,"He saw, confess'd, and said he was content."
8493,THE WAGER.,"Counter meantime selected, doubted, weigh'd,"
8494,THE WAGER.,And then brought home a young complying maid;
8495,THE WAGER.,"A tender creature, full of fears as charms,"
8496,THE WAGER.,A beauteous nursling from its mother's arms;
8497,THE WAGER.,"A soft, sweet blossom, such as men must love,"
8498,THE WAGER.,But to preserve must keep it in the stove:
8499,THE WAGER.,"She had a mild, subdued, expiring look -"
8500,THE WAGER.,"Raise but the voice, and this fair creature shook;"
8501,THE WAGER.,"Leave her alone, she felt a thousand fears -"

8505,THE WAGER.,One whom to govern none could be afraid -
8506,THE WAGER.,"Hold up the finger, this meek thing obey'd;"

8508,THE WAGER.,"Say but his will, no question would she ask;"
8509,THE WAGER.,"She sought no reasons, no affairs she knew,"
8510,THE WAGER.,"Of business spoke not, and had nought to do."
8511,THE WAGER.,"Oft he exclaim'd, ""How meek! how mild! how kind!"
8512,THE WAGER.,With her 'twere cruel but to seem unkind;
8513,THE WAGER.,"Though ever silent when I take my leave,"
8514,THE WAGER.,It pains my heart to think how hers will grieve;
8515,THE WAGER.,"'Tis heaven on earth with such a wife to dwell,"
8516,THE WAGER.,I am in raptures to have sped so well;

8519,THE WAGER.,"His Friend, though silent, felt the scorn implied -"
8520,THE WAGER.,"""What need of patience?"" to himself he cried:"
8521,THE WAGER.,"""Better a woman o'er her house to rule,"
8522,THE WAGER.,Than a poor child just hurried from her school;
8523,THE WAGER.,"Who has no care, yet never lives at ease;"
8524,THE WAGER.,"Unfit to rule, and indisposed to please."
8525,THE WAGER.,"What if he govern, there his boast should end;"
8526,THE WAGER.,"No husband's power can make a slave his friend."""
8527,THE WAGER.,It was the custom of these Friends to meet
8528,THE WAGER.,With a few neighbours in a neighbouring street;
8529,THE WAGER.,Where Counter ofttimes would occasion seize
8530,THE WAGER.,To move his silent Friend by words like these:
8531,THE WAGER.,"""A man,"" said he, ""if govern'd by his wife,"
8532,THE WAGER.,Gives up his rank and dignity in life;
8533,THE WAGER.,"Now, better fate befalls my Friend and me."" -"
8534,THE WAGER.,"He spoke, and look'd th' approving smile to see."
8535,THE WAGER.,"The quiet partner, when he chose to speak,"
8536,THE WAGER.,"Desired his friend ""another theme to seek;"
8537,THE WAGER.,"When thus they met, he judged that state-affairs"
8538,THE WAGER.,"And such important subjects should be theirs:"""
8539,THE WAGER.,"But still the partner, in his lighter vein,"
8540,THE WAGER.,Would cause in Clubb affliction or disdain;
8541,THE WAGER.,It made him anxious to detect the cause
8542,THE WAGER.,"Of all that boasting: --""Wants my friend applause?"
8543,THE WAGER.,"This plainly proves him not at perfect ease,"
8544,THE WAGER.,"For, felt he pleasure, he would wish to please."
8545,THE WAGER.,These triumphs here for some regrets atone -
8546,THE WAGER.,"Men who are bless'd let other men alone."""
8547,THE WAGER.,"Thus made suspicious, he observed and saw"
8548,THE WAGER.,His friend each night at early hour withdraw;
8549,THE WAGER.,"He sometimes mention'd Juliet's tender nerves,"
8550,THE WAGER.,And what attention such a wife deserves:
8551,THE WAGER.,"""In this,"" thought Clubb, ""full sure some mystery lies -"
8552,THE WAGER.,"He laughs at me, yet he with much complies,"
8553,THE WAGER.,"And all his vaunts of bliss are proud apologies."""
8554,THE WAGER.,"With such ideas treasured in his breast,"
8555,THE WAGER.,"He grew composed, and let his anger rest;"

8557,THE WAGER.,That friendship and discretion both were drown'd)
8558,THE WAGER.,"Began, in teasing and triumphant mood,"
8559,THE WAGER.,"His evening banter: --""Of all earthly good,"
8560,THE WAGER.,"The best,"" he said, ""was an obedient spouse,"
8561,THE WAGER.,Such as my friend's--that every one allows:
8562,THE WAGER.,What if she wishes his designs to know?
8563,THE WAGER.,It is because she would her praise bestow;
8564,THE WAGER.,What if she wills that he remain at home?
8565,THE WAGER.,She knows that mischief may from travel come.
8566,THE WAGER.,"I, who am free to venture where I please,"
8567,THE WAGER.,Have no such kind preventing checks as these;

8584,THE WAGER.,The friends around them saw with much delight
8585,THE WAGER.,"The social war, and hail'd the pleasant night;"
8586,THE WAGER.,"Nor would they further hear the cause discuss'd,"
8587,THE WAGER.,Afraid the recreant heart of Clubb to trust.
8588,THE WAGER.,"Now sober thoughts return'd as each withdrew,"
8589,THE WAGER.,And of the subject took a serious view:
8590,THE WAGER.,"""'Twas wrong,"" thought Counter, ""and will grieve my love;"""
8591,THE WAGER.,"""'Twas wrong,"" thought Clubb, ""my wife will not approve:"

8625,THE WAGER.,"""She all his councils, comforts, pleasures shared:"
8626,THE WAGER.,"She was assured he loved her from his soul,"
8627,THE WAGER.,She never knew and need not fear control;
8628,THE WAGER.,But so it happen'd--he was grieved at heart
8629,THE WAGER.,"It happen'd so, that they awhile must part"
8630,THE WAGER.,"A little time--the distance was but short,"
8631,THE WAGER.,And business called him--he despised the sport;
8632,THE WAGER.,But to Newmarket he engaged to ride
8633,THE WAGER.,"With his friend Clubb:"" and there he stopp'd and sigh'd."
8634,THE WAGER.,"Awhile the tender creature look'd dismay'd,"

8643,THE WAGER.,'Twas certain death--they might bespeak their shrouds.
8644,THE WAGER.,"He would attempt a race, be sure to fall -"
8645,THE WAGER.,And she expire with terror--that was all;
8646,THE WAGER.,With love like hers she was indeed unfit
8647,THE WAGER.,"To bear such horrors, but she must submit."""
8648,THE WAGER.,"""But for three days, my love! three days at most,"""
8649,THE WAGER.,"""Enough for me; I then shall be a ghost."""
8650,THE WAGER.,"""My honour's pledged!""--""Oh! yes, my dearest life,"
8651,THE WAGER.,I know your honour must outweigh your wife;
8652,THE WAGER.,But ere this absence have you sought a friend?
8653,THE WAGER.,I shall be dead--on whom can you depend?
8654,THE WAGER.,"Let me one favour of your kindness crave,"
8655,THE WAGER.,"Grant me the stone I mention'd for my grave."""
8656,THE WAGER.,"""Nay, love, attend--why, bless my soul! I say"
8657,THE WAGER.,"I will return--there, weep no longer, nay!"""
8658,THE WAGER.,"""Well! I obey, and to the last am true,"
8659,THE WAGER.,"But spirits fail me; I must die; adieu!"""
8660,THE WAGER.,"""What, Madam! must?--'tis wrong--I'm angry--zounds"

8662,THE WAGER.,"""Go then, my love! it is a monstrous sum,"
8663,THE WAGER.,"Worth twenty wives--go, love! and I am dumb;"

8665,THE WAGER.,"You might be angry, now you must forgive:"
8666,THE WAGER.,Alas! I faint--ah! cruel--there's no need
8667,THE WAGER.,"Of wounds or fevers--this has done the deed."""
8668,THE WAGER.,"The lady fainted, and the husband sent"
8669,THE WAGER.,For every aid--for every comfort went;
8670,THE WAGER.,"Strong terror seized him:  ""Oh! she loved so well,"
8671,THE WAGER.,"And who th' effect of tenderness could tell?"""
8672,THE WAGER.,"She now recover'd, and again began"
8673,THE WAGER.,"With accent querulous--""Ah! cruel man!"""
8674,THE WAGER.,"Till the sad husband, conscience-struck, confess'd,"
8675,THE WAGER.,'Twas very wicked with his friend to jest;
8676,THE WAGER.,"For now he saw that those who were obey'd,"
8677,THE WAGER.,Could like the most subservient feel afraid:
8678,THE WAGER.,And though a wife might not dispute the will

8680,THE WAGER.,"The morning came, and Clubb prepared to ride"
8681,THE WAGER.,"With a smart boy, his servant, and his guide;"
8682,THE WAGER.,"When, ere he mounted on his ready steed,"
8683,THE WAGER.,"Arrived a letter, and he stopped to read."
8684,THE WAGER.,"""My friend,"" he read, ""our journey I decline,"
8685,THE WAGER.,A heart too tender for such strife is mine;
8686,THE WAGER.,"Yours is the triumph, be you so inclined;"
8687,THE WAGER.,But you are too considerate and kind:
8688,THE WAGER.,In tender pity to my Juliet's fears
8689,THE WAGER.,"I thus relent, o'ercome by love and tears;"
8690,THE WAGER.,"She knows your kindness; I have heard her say,"
8691,THE WAGER.,A man like you 'tis pleasure to obey:
8692,THE WAGER.,"Each faithful wife, like ours, must disapprove"
8693,THE WAGER.,Such dangerous trifling with connubial love;
8694,THE WAGER.,"What has the idle world, my friend, to do"
8695,THE WAGER.,With our affairs? they envy me and you:
8696,THE WAGER.,What if I could my gentle spouse command -
8697,THE WAGER.,Is that a cause I should her tears withstand?
8698,THE WAGER.,"And what if you, a friend of peace, submit"
8699,THE WAGER.,To one you love--is that a theme for wit?
8700,THE WAGER.,"'Twas wrong, and I shall henceforth judge it weak"
8701,THE WAGER.,Both of submission and control to speak:
8702,THE WAGER.,"Be it agreed that all contention cease,"
8703,THE WAGER.,And no such follies vex our future peace;
8704,THE WAGER.,"Let each keep guard against domestic strife,"
8705,THE WAGER.,"And find nor slave nor tyrant in his wife."""
8706,THE WAGER.,"""Agreed,"" said Clubb, ""with all my soul agreed;"" -"
8707,THE WAGER.,"And to the boy, delighted, gave his steed."
8708,THE WAGER.,"""I think my friend has well his mind express'd,"
8709,THE WAGER.,"And I assent; such things are not a jest."""
8710,THE WAGER.,"""True,"" said the Wife, ""no longer he can hide"
8711,THE WAGER.,The truth that pains him by his wounded pride:
8712,THE WAGER.,"Your friend has found it not an easy thing,"
8713,THE WAGER.,Beneath his yoke this yielding soul to bring:
8714,THE WAGER.,"These weeping willows, though they seem inclined"
8715,THE WAGER.,"By every breeze, yet not the strongest wind"
8716,THE WAGER.,Can from their bent divert this weak but stubborn kind;
8717,THE WAGER.,"Drooping they seek your pity to excite,"
8718,THE WAGER.,But 'tis at once their nature and delight;
8719,THE WAGER.,"Such women feel not; while they sigh and weep,"
8720,THE WAGER.,'Tis but their habit--their affections sleep;
8721,THE WAGER.,"They are like ice that in the hand we hold,"
8722,THE WAGER.,"So very melting, yet so very cold;"
8723,THE WAGER.,"On such affection let not man rely,"
8724,THE WAGER.,"The husbands suffer, and the ladies sigh:"
8725,THE WAGER.,"But your friend's offer let us kindly take,"
8726,THE WAGER.,And spare his pride for his vexation's sake;
8727,THE WAGER.,"For he has found, and through his life will find,"

8856,THE CONVERT.,"These were his feelings, and he felt his way."
8857,THE CONVERT.,"Sprung from such sources, will this faith remain"

8870,THE CONVERT.,And pious pamphlets on the windows laid:
8871,THE CONVERT.,"By nature active, and from vice restrain'd,"
8872,THE CONVERT.,Increasing trade his bolder views sustain'd;
8873,THE CONVERT.,"His friends and teachers, finding so much zeal"
8874,THE CONVERT.,"In that young convert whom they taught to feel,"
8875,THE CONVERT.,"His trade encouraged, and were pleased to find"
8876,THE CONVERT.,"A hand so ready, with such humble mind."
8877,THE CONVERT.,"And now, his health restored, his spirits eased,"
8878,THE CONVERT.,"He wish'd to marry, if the teachers pleased."
8879,THE CONVERT.,"They, not unwilling, from the virgin-class"
8880,THE CONVERT.,Took him a comely and a courteous lass;
8881,THE CONVERT.,"Simple and civil, loving and beloved,"
8882,THE CONVERT.,She long a fond and faithful partner proved;
8883,THE CONVERT.,In every year the elders and the priest
8884,THE CONVERT.,Were duly summon'd to a christening feast;
8885,THE CONVERT.,"Nor came a babe, but by his growing trade"
8886,THE CONVERT.,John had provision for the coming made;
8887,THE CONVERT.,For friends and strangers all were pleased to deal
8888,THE CONVERT.,With one whose care was equal to his zeal.
8889,THE CONVERT.,"In human friendships, it compels a sigh"
8890,THE CONVERT.,To think what trifles will dissolve the tie.
8891,THE CONVERT.,"John, now become a master of his trade,"
8892,THE CONVERT.,Perceived how much improvement might be made;
8893,THE CONVERT.,"And as this prospect open'd to his view,"
8894,THE CONVERT.,A certain portion of his zeal withdrew;
8895,THE CONVERT.,"His fear abated--""What had he to fear -"
8896,THE CONVERT.,"His profits certain, and his conscience clear?"""
8897,THE CONVERT.,"Above his door a board was placed by John,"

8899,THE CONVERT.,"His window next, enlarged to twice the size,"
8900,THE CONVERT.,Shone with such trinkets as the simple prize;
8901,THE CONVERT.,While in the shop with pious works were seen
8902,THE CONVERT.,"The last new play, review, or magazine:"
8903,THE CONVERT.,"In orders punctual, he observed--""The books"

8905,THE CONVERT.,"Readers and critics should their merits try,"

8908,THE CONVERT.,"Of what they print, the authors must beware."""
8909,THE CONVERT.,"He held his patrons and his teachers dear,"
8910,THE CONVERT.,But with his trade they must not interfere.
8911,THE CONVERT.,'Twas certain now that John had lost the dread

8913,THE CONVERT.,"His habits varied, and he more inclined"
8914,THE CONVERT.,"To the vain world, which he had half resign'd;"
8915,THE CONVERT.,"He had moreover in his brethren seen,"
8916,THE CONVERT.,"Or he imagined, craft, conceit, and spleen:"
8917,THE CONVERT.,"""They are but men,"" said John, ""and shall I then"

8920,THE CONVERT.,"And good it is--I will not stand in awe."""
8921,THE CONVERT.,"Moreover Dighton, though he thought of books"
8922,THE CONVERT.,"As one who chiefly on the title looks,"
8923,THE CONVERT.,"Yet sometimes ponder'd o'er a page to find,"
8924,THE CONVERT.,"When vex'd with cares, amusement for his mind;"
8925,THE CONVERT.,And by degrees that mind had treasured much
8926,THE CONVERT.,From works his teachers were afraid to touch:
8927,THE CONVERT.,"Satiric novels, poets bold and free,"
8928,THE CONVERT.,And what their writers term philosophy;
8929,THE CONVERT.,"All these were read, and he began to feel"
8930,THE CONVERT.,Some self-approval on his bosom steal.
8931,THE CONVERT.,"Wisdom creates humility, but he"
8932,THE CONVERT.,Who thus collects it will not humble be:
8933,THE CONVERT.,No longer John was fill'd with pure delight
8934,THE CONVERT.,And humble reverence in a pastor's sight;
8935,THE CONVERT.,"Who, like a grateful zealot, listening stood,"
8936,THE CONVERT.,To hear a man so friendly and so good;
8937,THE CONVERT.,But felt the dignity of one who made
8938,THE CONVERT.,Himself important by a thriving trade:
8939,THE CONVERT.,And growing pride in Dighton's mind was bred
8940,THE CONVERT.,By the strange food on which it coarsely fed.
8941,THE CONVERT.,Their Brother's fall the grieving Brethren heard -
8942,THE CONVERT.,His pride indeed to all around appeared;
8943,THE CONVERT.,"The world, his friends agreed, had won the soul"
8944,THE CONVERT.,"From its best hopes, the man from their control."
8945,THE CONVERT.,"To make him humble, and confine his views"
8946,THE CONVERT.,"Within their bounds, and books which they peruse,"
8947,THE CONVERT.,A deputation from these friends select
8948,THE CONVERT.,Might reason with him to some good effect;
8949,THE CONVERT.,"Arm'd with authority, and led by love,"
8950,THE CONVERT.,They might those follies from his mind remove.
8951,THE CONVERT.,"Deciding thus, and with this kind intent,"
8952,THE CONVERT.,A chosen body with its speaker went.
8953,THE CONVERT.,"""John,"" said the Teacher, ""John, with great concern."
8954,THE CONVERT.,"We see thy frailty, and thy fate discern -"
8955,THE CONVERT.,"Satan with toils thy simple soul beset,"
8956,THE CONVERT.,And thou art careless slumbering in the net:
8957,THE CONVERT.,Unmindful art thou of thy early vow;
8958,THE CONVERT.,Who at the morning meeting sees thee now?
8959,THE CONVERT.,Who at the evening?  'Where is brother John?'
8960,THE CONVERT.,"We ask;--are answer'd, 'To the tavern gone.'"
8961,THE CONVERT.,Thee on the Sabbath seldom we behold;
8962,THE CONVERT.,"Thou canst not sing, thou'rt nursing for a cold:"
8963,THE CONVERT.,"This from the churchmen thou hast learn'd, for they"
8964,THE CONVERT.,Have colds and fevers on the Sabbath-day;
8965,THE CONVERT.,"When in some snug warm room they sit, and pen"
8966,THE CONVERT.,"Bills from their ledgers--world-entangled men,"
8967,THE CONVERT.,"""See with what pride thou hast enlarged thy shop;"
8968,THE CONVERT.,To view thy tempting stores the heedless stop.
8969,THE CONVERT.,"By what strange names dost thou these baubles know,"
8970,THE CONVERT.,"Which wantons wear, to make a sinful show?"
8971,THE CONVERT.,Hast thou in view these idle volumes placed
8972,THE CONVERT.,To be the pander of a vicious taste?
8973,THE CONVERT.,What's here? a book of dances!--you advance
8974,THE CONVERT.,"In goodly knowledge--John, wilt learn to dance?"
8975,THE CONVERT.,"How!  'Go,' it says, and 'to the devil go!"
8976,THE CONVERT.,And shake thyself!'  I tremble--but 'tis so;
8977,THE CONVERT.,"Wretch as thou art, what answer canst thou make?"
8978,THE CONVERT.,"Oh! without question, thou wilt go and shake."
8979,THE CONVERT.,What's here?  'The School for Scandal'--pretty schools!
8980,THE CONVERT.,"Well, and art thou proficient in the rules?"
8981,THE CONVERT.,Art thou a pupil?  Is it thy design
8982,THE CONVERT.,To make our names contemptible as thine?
8983,THE CONVERT.,"'Old Nick, a novel!' oh! 'tis mighty well -"
8984,THE CONVERT.,A fool has courage when he laughs at hell;
8985,THE CONVERT.,'Frolic and Fun;' the Humours of Tim Grin;'
8986,THE CONVERT.,"Why, John, thou grow'st facetious in thy sin;"
8987,THE CONVERT.,And what?--'The Archdeacon's Charge!'--'tis mighty well -
8988,THE CONVERT.,"If Satan publish'd, thou wouldst doubtless sell:"
8989,THE CONVERT.,"Jests, novels, dances, and this precious stuff"
8990,THE CONVERT.,To crown thy folly--we have seen enough;
8991,THE CONVERT.,We find thee fitted for each evil work:
8992,THE CONVERT.,Do print the Koran and become a Turk.
8993,THE CONVERT.,"""John, thou art lost; success and worldly pride"
8994,THE CONVERT.,"O'er all thy thoughts and purposes preside,"
8995,THE CONVERT.,"Have bound thee fast, and drawn thee far aside:"
8996,THE CONVERT.,"Yet turn; these sin-traps from thy shop expel,"
8997,THE CONVERT.,"Repent and pray, and all may yet be well."
8998,THE CONVERT.,"""And here thy wife, thy Dorothy behold,"
8999,THE CONVERT.,How fashion's wanton robes her form infold!
9000,THE CONVERT.,"Can grace, can goodness with such trappings dwell?"
9001,THE CONVERT.,"John, thou hast made thy wife a Jezebel:"
9002,THE CONVERT.,"See! on her bosom rests the sign of sin,"
9003,THE CONVERT.,The glaring proof of naughty thoughts within:
9004,THE CONVERT.,"What! 'tis a cross:  come hither--as a friend,"
9005,THE CONVERT.,"Thus from thy neck the shameful badge I rend."""
9006,THE CONVERT.,"""Rend, if you dare,"" said Dighton; ""you shall find"
9007,THE CONVERT.,"A man of spirit, though to peace inclined;"
9008,THE CONVERT.,Call me ungrateful! have I not my pay
9009,THE CONVERT.,At all times ready for the expected day?
9010,THE CONVERT.,"To share my plenteous board you deign to come,"
9011,THE CONVERT.,"Myself your pupil, and my house your home:"
9012,THE CONVERT.,And shall the persons who my meat enjoy
9013,THE CONVERT.,"Talk of my faults, and treat me as a boy?"
9014,THE CONVERT.,Have you not told how Rome's insulting priests
9015,THE CONVERT.,Led their meek laymen like a herd of beasts;
9016,THE CONVERT.,And by their fleecing and their forgery made
9017,THE CONVERT.,Their holy calling an accursed trade?
9018,THE CONVERT.,"Can you such acts and insolence condemn,"
9019,THE CONVERT.,Who to your utmost power resemble them?
9020,THE CONVERT.,"""Concerns it you what books I set for sale?"
9021,THE CONVERT.,The tale perchance may be a virtuous tale;
9022,THE CONVERT.,"And for the rest, 'tis neither wise nor just"
9023,THE CONVERT.,"In you, who read not, to condemn on trust;"
9024,THE CONVERT.,Why should th' Archdeacon's Charge your spleen excite?
9025,THE CONVERT.,"He, or perchance th' Archbishop, may be right."
9026,THE CONVERT.,"""That from your meetings I refrain is true:"
9027,THE CONVERT.,I meet with nothing pleasant--nothing new;
9028,THE CONVERT.,"But the same proofs, that not one text explain,"
9029,THE CONVERT.,"And the same lights, where all things dark remain;"
9030,THE CONVERT.,I thought you saints on earth--but I have found
9031,THE CONVERT.,"Some sins among you, and the best unsound:"
9032,THE CONVERT.,"You have your failings, like the crowds below,"
9033,THE CONVERT.,And at your pleasure hot and cold can blow:
9034,THE CONVERT.,"When I at first your grave deportment saw,"
9035,THE CONVERT.,"(I own my folly,) I was fill'd with awe;"
9036,THE CONVERT.,"You spoke so warmly, and it seem'd so well,"
9037,THE CONVERT.,I should have thought it treason to rebel.
9038,THE CONVERT.,Is it a wonder that a man like me
9039,THE CONVERT.,Should such perfection in such teachers see -
9040,THE CONVERT.,"Nay, should conceive you sent from Heaven to brave"
9041,THE CONVERT.,"The host of sin, and sinful souls to save?"
9042,THE CONVERT.,"But as our reason wakes, our prospects clear,"
9043,THE CONVERT.,"And failings, flaws, and blemishes appear."
9044,THE CONVERT.,"""When you were mounted in your rostrum high,"
9045,THE CONVERT.,"We shrank beneath your tone, your frown, your eye:"
9046,THE CONVERT.,"Then you beheld us abject, fallen, low,"
9047,THE CONVERT.,And felt your glory from our baseness grow;
9048,THE CONVERT.,"Touch'd by your words, I trembled like the rest,"
9049,THE CONVERT.,And my own vileness and your power confess'd:
9050,THE CONVERT.,"These, I exclaim'd, are men divine, and gazed"
9051,THE CONVERT.,"On him who taught, delighted and amazed;"
9052,THE CONVERT.,"Glad when he finish'd, if by chance he cast"
9053,THE CONVERT.,One look on such a sinner as he pass'd.
9054,THE CONVERT.,"""But when I view'd you in a clearer light,"
9055,THE CONVERT.,And saw the frail and carnal appetite;
9056,THE CONVERT.,"When at his humble pray'r, you deign'd to eat,"
9057,THE CONVERT.,"Saints as you are, a civil sinner's meat;"
9058,THE CONVERT.,"When, as you sat contented and at ease,"
9059,THE CONVERT.,"Nibbling at leisure on the ducks and peas,"
9060,THE CONVERT.,"And, pleased some comforts in such place to find,"
9061,THE CONVERT.,You could descend to be a little kind;
9062,THE CONVERT.,And gave us hope in heaven there might be room
9063,THE CONVERT.,For a few souls beside your own to come;
9064,THE CONVERT.,"While this world's good engaged your carnal view,"
9065,THE CONVERT.,And like a sinner you enjoy'd it too;
9066,THE CONVERT.,"All this perceiving, can you think it strange"
9067,THE CONVERT.,"That change in you should work an equal change?"""
9068,THE CONVERT.,"""Wretch that thou art,"" an elder cried, ""and gone"
9069,THE CONVERT.,"For everlasting!""--""Go thyself,"" said John;"
9070,THE CONVERT.,"Depart this instant, let me hear no more;"
9071,THE CONVERT.,"My house my castle is, and that my door."""
9072,THE CONVERT.,"The hint they took, and from the door withdrew,"
9073,THE CONVERT.,And John to meeting bade a long adieu;
9074,THE CONVERT.,"Attached to business, he in time became"
9075,THE CONVERT.,A wealthy man of no inferior name.
9076,THE CONVERT.,"It seem'd, alas! in John's deluded sight,"
9077,THE CONVERT.,That all was wrong because not all was right:
9078,THE CONVERT.,"And when he found his teachers had their stains,"
9079,THE CONVERT.,Resentment and not reason broke his chains:
9080,THE CONVERT.,"Thus on his feelings he again relied,"
9081,THE CONVERT.,And never look'd to reason for his guide:
9082,THE CONVERT.,"Could he have wisely view'd the frailty shown,"
9083,THE CONVERT.,"And rightly weigh'd their wanderings and his own,"
9084,THE CONVERT.,"He might have known that men may be sincere,"
9085,THE CONVERT.,Though gay and feasting on the savoury cheer;
9086,THE CONVERT.,"That doctrines sound and sober they may teach,"
9087,THE CONVERT.,Who love to eat with all the glee they preach;
9088,THE CONVERT.,"Nay! who believe the duck, the grape, the pine,"
9089,THE CONVERT.,Were not intended for the dog and swine:
9090,THE CONVERT.,But Dighton's hasty mind on every theme
9091,THE CONVERT.,"Ran from the truth, and rested in th' extreme:"
9092,THE CONVERT.,"Flaws in his friends he found, and then withdrew"
9093,THE CONVERT.,"(Vain of his knowledge) from their virtues too,"
9094,THE CONVERT.,Best of his books he loved the liberal kind
9095,THE CONVERT.,"That, if they improve not, still enlarge the mind;"
9096,THE CONVERT.,"And found himself, with such advisers, free"
9097,THE CONVERT.,"From a fix'd creed, as mind enlarged could be."
9098,THE CONVERT.,"His humble wife at these opinions sigh'd,"
9099,THE CONVERT.,But her he never heeded till she died:
9100,THE CONVERT.,"He then assented to a last request,"
9101,THE CONVERT.,And by the meeting-window let her rest;
9102,THE CONVERT.,"And on her stone the sacred text was seen,"
9103,THE CONVERT.,Which had her comfort in departing been.
9104,THE CONVERT.,"Dighton with joy beheld his trade advance,"
9105,THE CONVERT.,"Yet seldom published, loth to trust to chance:"
9106,THE CONVERT.,"Then wed a doctor's sister--poor indeed,"
9107,THE CONVERT.,But skill'd in works her husband could not read;
9108,THE CONVERT.,"Who, if he wish'd new ways of wealth to seek,"
9109,THE CONVERT.,Could make her half-crown pamphlet in a week:
9110,THE CONVERT.,"This he rejected, though without disdain."
9111,THE CONVERT.,And chose the old and certain way to gain.
9112,THE CONVERT.,"Thus he proceeded:  trade increased the while,"
9113,THE CONVERT.,And fortune woo'd him with perpetual smile:
9114,THE CONVERT.,"On early scenes he sometimes cast a thought,"
9115,THE CONVERT.,When on his heart the mighty change was wrought;
9116,THE CONVERT.,And all the ease and comfort Converts find
9117,THE CONVERT.,Was magnified in his reflecting mind:
9118,THE CONVERT.,"Then on the teacher's priestly pride he dwelt,"
9119,THE CONVERT.,"That caused his freedom, but with this he felt"
9120,THE CONVERT.,The danger of the free--for since that day
9121,THE CONVERT.,"No guide had shown, no brethren join'd his way;"
9122,THE CONVERT.,"Forsaking one, he found no second creed,"
9123,THE CONVERT.,"But reading doubted, doubting what to read."
9124,THE CONVERT.,"Still, though reproof had brought some present pain,"
9125,THE CONVERT.,The gain he made was fair and honest gain;
9126,THE CONVERT.,"He laid his wares indeed in public view,"
9127,THE CONVERT.,But that all traders claim a right to do:
9128,THE CONVERT.,"By means like these, he saw his wealth increase,"
9129,THE CONVERT.,"And felt his consequence, and dwelt in peace."
9130,THE CONVERT.,"Our Hero's age was threescore years and five,"
9131,THE CONVERT.,"When he exclaim'd, ""Why longer should I strive?"
9132,THE CONVERT.,"Why more amass, who never must behold"
9133,THE CONVERT.,"A young John Dighton to make glad the old?"""
9134,THE CONVERT.,"(The sons he had to early graves were gone,"
9135,THE CONVERT.,And girls were burdens to the mind of John.)
9136,THE CONVERT.,"""Had I a boy, he would our name sustain,"
9137,THE CONVERT.,That now to nothing must return again;
9138,THE CONVERT.,"But what are all my profits, credit, trade,"
9139,THE CONVERT.,"And parish honours?--folly and parade."""
9140,THE CONVERT.,"Thus Dighton thought, and in his looks appeared"
9141,THE CONVERT.,"Sadness, increased by much he saw and heard;"
9142,THE CONVERT.,"The Brethren often at the shop would stay,"
9143,THE CONVERT.,And make their comments ere they walk'd away;
9144,THE CONVERT.,"They mark'd the window, fill'd in every pane"
9145,THE CONVERT.,With lawless prints of reputations slain;
9146,THE CONVERT.,"Distorted forms of men with honours graced,"
9147,THE CONVERT.,And our chief rulers in dirision placed:
9148,THE CONVERT.,"Amazed they stood, remembering well the days"
9149,THE CONVERT.,When to be humble was their brother's praise;
9150,THE CONVERT.,When at the dwelling of their friend they stopped;
9151,THE CONVERT.,"To drop a word, or to receive it dropp'd;"
9152,THE CONVERT.,"Where they beheld the prints of men renown'd,"
9153,THE CONVERT.,"And far-famed preachers pasted all around,"
9154,THE CONVERT.,(Such mouths! eyes! hair! so prim! so fierce! so sleek!
9155,THE CONVERT.,They look'd as speaking what is woe to speak):
9156,THE CONVERT.,On these the passing brethren loved to dwell -
9157,THE CONVERT.,How long they spake! how strongly! warmly! well!
9158,THE CONVERT.,"What power had each to dive in mysteries deep,"
9159,THE CONVERT.,"To warm the cold, to make the harden'd weep;"
9160,THE CONVERT.,"To lure, to fright, to soothe, to awe the soul,"
9161,THE CONVERT.,And listening locks to lead and to control!
9162,THE CONVERT.,"But now discoursing, as they linger'd near,"
9163,THE CONVERT.,They tempted John (whom they accused) to hear
9164,THE CONVERT.,"Their weighty charge--""And can the lost one feel,"
9165,THE CONVERT.,"As in the time of duty, love, and zeal;"
9166,THE CONVERT.,"When all were summon'd at the rising sun,"
9167,THE CONVERT.,And he was ready with his friends to run;
9168,THE CONVERT.,"When he, partaking with a chosen few,"
9169,THE CONVERT.,"Felt the great change, sensation rich and new?"
9170,THE CONVERT.,No! all is lost; her favours Fortune shower'd
9171,THE CONVERT.,"Upon the man, and he is overpower'd;"
9172,THE CONVERT.,The world has won him with its tempting store
9173,THE CONVERT.,"Of needless wealth, and that has made him poor:"
9174,THE CONVERT.,"Success undoes him; he has risen to fall,"
9175,THE CONVERT.,"Has gain'd a fortune, and has lost his all;"
9176,THE CONVERT.,"Gone back from Sion, he will find his age"
9177,THE CONVERT.,Loth to commence a second pilgrimage;
9178,THE CONVERT.,"He has retreated from the chosen track,"
9179,THE CONVERT.,"And now must ever bear the burden on his back."""
9180,THE CONVERT.,"Hurt by such censure, John began to find"
9181,THE CONVERT.,Fresh revolutions working in his mind;
9182,THE CONVERT.,"He sought for comfort in his books, but read"
9183,THE CONVERT.,Without a plan or method in his head;
9184,THE CONVERT.,"What once amused, now rather made him sad;"
9185,THE CONVERT.,"What should inform, increased the doubts he had;"
9186,THE CONVERT.,"Shame would not let him seek at Church a guide,"
9187,THE CONVERT.,And from his Meeting he was held by pride;
9188,THE CONVERT.,"His wife derided fears she never felt,"
9189,THE CONVERT.,And passing brethren daily censures dealt;
9190,THE CONVERT.,"Hope for a son was now for ever past,"
9191,THE CONVERT.,He was the first John Dighton and the last;
9192,THE CONVERT.,"His stomach fail'd, his case the doctor knew,"
9193,THE CONVERT.,"But said, ""he still might hold a year or two."""
9194,THE CONVERT.,"""No more!"" he said; ""but why should I complain?"
9195,THE CONVERT.,A life of doubt must be a life of pain:
9196,THE CONVERT.,Could I be sure--but why should I despair?
9197,THE CONVERT.,I'm sure my conduct has been just and fair;
9198,THE CONVERT.,"In youth, indeed, I had a wicked will,"
9199,THE CONVERT.,"But I repented, and have sorrow still:"
9200,THE CONVERT.,"I had my comforts, and a growing trade"
9201,THE CONVERT.,Gave greater pleasure than a fortune made;
9202,THE CONVERT.,"And as I more possess'd, and reason'd more,"
9203,THE CONVERT.,"I lost those comforts I enjoy'd before,"
9204,THE CONVERT.,"When reverend guides I saw my table round,"
9205,THE CONVERT.,And in my guardian guest my safety found:
9206,THE CONVERT.,"Now sick and sad, no appetite, no ease,"
9207,THE CONVERT.,"Nor pleasures have I, nor a wish to please;"
9208,THE CONVERT.,"Nor views, nor hopes, nor plans, nor taste have I;"
9209,THE CONVERT.,"Yet, sick of life, have no desire to die."""
9210,THE CONVERT.,"He said, and died:  his trade, his name is gone,"
9211,THE CONVERT.,And all that once gave consequence to John.
9212,THE CONVERT.,Unhappy Dighton! had he found a friend
9213,THE CONVERT.,When conscience told him it was time to mend -
9214,THE CONVERT.,"A friend descreet, considerate, kind, sincere,"
9215,THE CONVERT.,"Who would have shown the grounds of hope and fear,"
9216,THE CONVERT.,"And proved that spirits, whether high or low,"
9217,THE CONVERT.,No certain tokens of man's safety show -
9218,THE CONVERT.,"Had Reason ruled him in her proper place,"
9219,THE CONVERT.,And Virtue led him while he lean'd on grace -
9220,THE CONVERT.,"Had he while zealous been discreet and pure,"
9221,THE CONVERT.,"His knowledge humble, and his hope secure; -"
9222,THE CONVERT.,"These guides had placed him on the solid rock,"
9223,THE CONVERT.,"Where Faith had rested, nor received a shock;"
9224,THE CONVERT.,"But his, alas! was placed upon the sand,"
9225,THE CONVERT.,"Where long it stood not, and where none can stand."

9251,THE BROTHERS.,"Than old George Fletcher, on the British coast"
9252,THE BROTHERS.,Dwelt not a seaman who had more to boast:
9253,THE BROTHERS.,"Kind, simple and sincere--he seldom spoke,"
9254,THE BROTHERS.,"But sometimes sang and chorus'd--""Hearts of Oak:"""
9255,THE BROTHERS.,"In dangers steady, with his lot content,"
9256,THE BROTHERS.,His days in labour and in love were spent.
9257,THE BROTHERS.,"He left a Son so like him, that the old"
9258,THE BROTHERS.,"With joy exclaim'd, ""'Tis Fletcher we behold;"""
9259,THE BROTHERS.,"But to his Brother, when the kinsmen came"
9260,THE BROTHERS.,"And view'd his form, they grudged the father's name."
9261,THE BROTHERS.,"George was a bold, intrepid, careless lad,"
9262,THE BROTHERS.,With just the failings that his father had;
9263,THE BROTHERS.,"Isaac was weak, attentive, slow, exact,"
9264,THE BROTHERS.,With just the virtues that his father lack'd.
9265,THE BROTHERS.,George lived at sea:  upon the land a guest -
9266,THE BROTHERS.,"He sought for recreation, not for rest;"
9267,THE BROTHERS.,"While, far unlike, his brother's feebler form"
9268,THE BROTHERS.,"Shrank from the cold, and shudder'd at the storm;"
9269,THE BROTHERS.,"Still with the Seaman's to connect his trade,"
9270,THE BROTHERS.,The boy was bound where blocks and ropes were made.
9271,THE BROTHERS.,"George, strong and sturdy, had a tender mind,"
9272,THE BROTHERS.,And was to Isaac pitiful and kind;
9273,THE BROTHERS.,"A very father, till his art was gain'd,"
9274,THE BROTHERS.,And then a friend unwearied he remain'd;
9275,THE BROTHERS.,"He saw his brother was of spirit low,"
9276,THE BROTHERS.,"His temper peevish, and his motions slow;"
9277,THE BROTHERS.,"Not fit to bustle in a world, or make"
9278,THE BROTHERS.,Friends to his fortune for his merit's sake;
9279,THE BROTHERS.,But the kind sailor could not boast the art
9280,THE BROTHERS.,Of looking deeply in the human heart;
9281,THE BROTHERS.,Else had he seen that this weak brother knew
9282,THE BROTHERS.,What men to court--what objects to pursue;
9283,THE BROTHERS.,"That he to distant gain the way discern'd,"
9284,THE BROTHERS.,And none so crooked but his genius learn'd.
9285,THE BROTHERS.,"Isaac was poor, and this the brother felt;"
9286,THE BROTHERS.,"He hired a house, and there the Landman dwelt,"
9287,THE BROTHERS.,"Wrought at his trade, and had an easy home,"
9288,THE BROTHERS.,For there would George with cash and comforts come;
9289,THE BROTHERS.,"And when they parted, Isaac look'd around"
9290,THE BROTHERS.,Where other friends and helpers might be found.
9291,THE BROTHERS.,"He wish'd for some port-place, and one might fall,"
9292,THE BROTHERS.,"He wisely thought, if he should try for all;"
9293,THE BROTHERS.,"He had a vote--and were it well applied,"
9294,THE BROTHERS.,Might have its worth--and he had views beside;
9295,THE BROTHERS.,Old Burgess Steel was able to promote
9296,THE BROTHERS.,An humble man who served him with a vote;
9297,THE BROTHERS.,"For Isaac felt not what some tempers feel,"
9298,THE BROTHERS.,But bow'd and bent the neck to Burgess Steel;
9299,THE BROTHERS.,"And great attention to a lady gave,"
9300,THE BROTHERS.,"His ancient friend, a maiden spare and grave;"
9301,THE BROTHERS.,One whom the visage long and look demure
9302,THE BROTHERS.,Of Isaac pleased--he seem'd sedate and pure;
9303,THE BROTHERS.,And his soft heart conceived a gentle flame
9304,THE BROTHERS.,For her who waited on this virtuous dame.
9305,THE BROTHERS.,"Not an outrageous love, a scorching fire,"
9306,THE BROTHERS.,But friendly liking and chastised desire;
9307,THE BROTHERS.,"And thus he waited, patient in delay,"
9308,THE BROTHERS.,In present favour and in fortune's way.
9309,THE BROTHERS.,"George then was coasting--war was yet delay'd,"
9310,THE BROTHERS.,And what he gain'd was to his brother paid;
9311,THE BROTHERS.,"Nor ask'd the Seaman what he saved or spent,"
9312,THE BROTHERS.,"But took his grog, wrought hard, and was content;"
9313,THE BROTHERS.,"Till war awaked the land, and George began"
9314,THE BROTHERS.,To think what part became a useful man:
9315,THE BROTHERS.,"""Press'd, I must go:  why, then, 'tis better far"
9316,THE BROTHERS.,"At once to enter like a British tar,"
9317,THE BROTHERS.,"Than a brave captain and the foe to shun,"
9318,THE BROTHERS.,"As if I fear'd the music of a gun."""
9319,THE BROTHERS.,"""Go not!"" said Isaac--""you shall wear disguise."""
9320,THE BROTHERS.,"""What!"" said the Seaman, ""clothe myself with lies!"""
9321,THE BROTHERS.,"""Oh! but there's danger.""--""Danger in the fleet?"
9322,THE BROTHERS.,"You cannot mean, good brother, of defeat;"
9323,THE BROTHERS.,And other dangers I at land must share -
9324,THE BROTHERS.,"So now adieu! and trust a brother's care."""
9325,THE BROTHERS.,"Isaac awhile demurr'd--but, in his heart,"
9326,THE BROTHERS.,"So might he share, he was disposed to part:"
9327,THE BROTHERS.,The better mind will sometimes feel the pain
9328,THE BROTHERS.,Of benefactions--favour is a chain;
9329,THE BROTHERS.,"But they the feeling scorn, and what they wish, disdain;"
9330,THE BROTHERS.,While beings form'd in coarser mould will hate
9331,THE BROTHERS.,The helping hand they ought to venerate:
9332,THE BROTHERS.,"No wonder George should in this cause prevail,"
9333,THE BROTHERS.,With one contending who was glad to fail:
9334,THE BROTHERS.,"""Isaac, farewell! do wipe that doleful eye;"
9335,THE BROTHERS.,"Crying we came, and groaning we may die;"
9336,THE BROTHERS.,Let us do something 'twixt the groan and cry:
9337,THE BROTHERS.,"And hear me, brother, whether pay or prize,"
9338,THE BROTHERS.,One half to thee I give and I devise;
9339,THE BROTHERS.,Por thou hast oft occasion for the aid
9340,THE BROTHERS.,"Of learn'd physicians, and they will be paid;"
9341,THE BROTHERS.,"Their wives and children men support at sea,"
9342,THE BROTHERS.,"And thou, my lad, art wife and child to me:"
9343,THE BROTHERS.,"Farewell! I go where hope and honour call,"
9344,THE BROTHERS.,"Nor does it follow that who fights must fall,"""
9345,THE BROTHERS.,"Isaac here made a poor attempt to speak,"
9346,THE BROTHERS.,And a huge tear moved slowly down his cheek;
9347,THE BROTHERS.,"Like Pluto's iron drop, hard sign of grace,"
9348,THE BROTHERS.,"It slowly roll'd upon the rueful face,"
9349,THE BROTHERS.,Forced by the striving will alone its way to trace.
9350,THE BROTHERS.,"Years fled--war lasted--George at sea remain'd,"
9351,THE BROTHERS.,While the slow Landman still his profits gain'd:
9352,THE BROTHERS.,An humble place was vacant--he besought
9353,THE BROTHERS.,"His patron's interest, and the office caught;"
9354,THE BROTHERS.,"For still the Virgin was his faithful friend,"
9355,THE BROTHERS.,"And one so sober could with truth commend,"
9356,THE BROTHERS.,"Who of his own defects most humbly thought,"
9357,THE BROTHERS.,And their advice with zeal and reverence sought:
9358,THE BROTHERS.,"Whom thus the Mistress praised, the Maid approved,"
9359,THE BROTHERS.,And her he wedded whom he wisely loved.
9360,THE BROTHERS.,"No more he needs assistance--but, alas!"
9361,THE BROTHERS.,He fears the money will for liquor pass;
9362,THE BROTHERS.,"Or that the Seaman might to flatterers lend,"
9363,THE BROTHERS.,Or give support to some pretended friend:
9364,THE BROTHERS.,"Still he must write--he wrote, and he confess'd"
9365,THE BROTHERS.,"That, till absolved, he should be sore distress'd;"
9366,THE BROTHERS.,"But one so friendly would, he thought, forgive"
9367,THE BROTHERS.,The hasty deed--Heav'n knew how he should live;
9368,THE BROTHERS.,"""But you,"" he added, ""as a man of sense,"
9369,THE BROTHERS.,Have well consider'd danger and expense:
9370,THE BROTHERS.,"I ran, alas! into the fatal snare,"
9371,THE BROTHERS.,And now for trouble must my mind prepare;
9372,THE BROTHERS.,"And how, with children, I shall pick my way"
9373,THE BROTHERS.,"Through a hard world, is more than I can say:"
9374,THE BROTHERS.,"Then change not, Brother, your more happy state,"
9375,THE BROTHERS.,"Or on the hazard long deliberate."""
9376,THE BROTHERS.,"George answered gravely, ""It is right and fit,"
9377,THE BROTHERS.,"In all our crosses, humbly to submit:"
9378,THE BROTHERS.,"Your apprehensions are unwise, unjust;"
9379,THE BROTHERS.,"Forbear repining, and expel distrust."""
9380,THE BROTHERS.,"He added, ""Marriage was the joy of life,"""
9381,THE BROTHERS.,And gave his service to his brother's wife;
9382,THE BROTHERS.,"Then vow'd to bear in all expense a part,"
9383,THE BROTHERS.,"And thus concluded, ""Have a cheerful heart."""
9384,THE BROTHERS.,"Had the glad Isaac been his brother's guide,"
9385,THE BROTHERS.,In the same terms the Seaman had replied;
9386,THE BROTHERS.,"At such reproofs the crafty Landman smiled,"
9387,THE BROTHERS.,"And softly said, ""This creature is a child."""
9388,THE BROTHERS.,Twice had the gallant ship a capture made -
9389,THE BROTHERS.,"And when in port the happy crew were paid,"
9390,THE BROTHERS.,"Home went the Sailor, with his pockets stored,"
9391,THE BROTHERS.,"Ease to enjoy, and pleasure to afford;"
9392,THE BROTHERS.,"His time was short, joy shone in every face,"
9393,THE BROTHERS.,Isaac half fainted in the fond embrace:
9394,THE BROTHERS.,"The wife resolved her honour'd guest to please,"
9395,THE BROTHERS.,The children clung upon their uncle's knees;
9396,THE BROTHERS.,"The grog went round, the neighbours drank his health,"
9397,THE BROTHERS.,"And George exclaimed, ""Ah! what to this is wealth?"
9398,THE BROTHERS.,"Better,"" said he, ""to bear a loving heart,"
9399,THE BROTHERS.,"Than roll in riches--but we now must part!"""
9400,THE BROTHERS.,All yet is still--but hark! the winds o'ersweep
9401,THE BROTHERS.,"The rising waves, and howl upon the deep;"
9402,THE BROTHERS.,Ships late becalm'd on mountain-billows ride -
9403,THE BROTHERS.,So life is threaten'd and so man is tried.
9404,THE BROTHERS.,"Ill were the tidings that arrived from sea,"
9405,THE BROTHERS.,The worthy George must now a cripple be:
9406,THE BROTHERS.,"His leg was lopp'd; and though his heart was sound,"
9407,THE BROTHERS.,"Though his brave captain was with glory crown'd,"
9408,THE BROTHERS.,"Yet much it vex'd him to repose on shore,"
9409,THE BROTHERS.,"An idle log, and be of use no more:"
9410,THE BROTHERS.,"True, he was sure that Isaac would receive"
9411,THE BROTHERS.,All of his Brother that the foe might leave;
9412,THE BROTHERS.,"To whom the Seaman his design had sent,"
9413,THE BROTHERS.,Ere from the port the wounded hero went:
9414,THE BROTHERS.,"His wealth and expectations told, he ""knew"
9415,THE BROTHERS.,"Wherein they fail'd, what Isaac's love would do;"
9416,THE BROTHERS.,"That he the grog and cabin would supply,"
9417,THE BROTHERS.,"Where George at anchor during life would lie."""
9418,THE BROTHERS.,"The Landman read--and, reading, grew distress'd:  -"
9419,THE BROTHERS.,"""Could he resolve t'admit so poor a guest?"
9420,THE BROTHERS.,"Better at Greenwich might the Sailor stay,"
9421,THE BROTHERS.,"Unless his purse could for his comforts pay."""
9422,THE BROTHERS.,"So Isaac judged, and to his wife appealed,"
9423,THE BROTHERS.,But yet acknowledged it was best to yield:
9424,THE BROTHERS.,"""Perhaps his pension, with what sums remain"
9425,THE BROTHERS.,"Due or unsquander'd, may the man maintain;"
9426,THE BROTHERS.,"Refuse we must not.""--With a heavy sigh"
9427,THE BROTHERS.,"The lady heard, and made her kind reply:  -"
9428,THE BROTHERS.,"""Nor would I wish it, Isaac, were we sure"
9429,THE BROTHERS.,How long this crazy building will endure;
9430,THE BROTHERS.,"Like an old house, that every day appears"
9431,THE BROTHERS.,"About to fall, he may be propp'd for years;"
9432,THE BROTHERS.,"For a few months, indeed, we might comply,"
9433,THE BROTHERS.,"But these old batter'd fellows never die."""
9434,THE BROTHERS.,"The hand of Isaac, George on entering took,"
9435,THE BROTHERS.,With love and resignation in his look;
9436,THE BROTHERS.,"Declared his comfort in the fortune past,"
9437,THE BROTHERS.,And joy to find his anchor safely cast:
9438,THE BROTHERS.,"""Call then my nephews, let the grog be brought,"
9439,THE BROTHERS.,"And I will tell them how the ship was fought."""
9440,THE BROTHERS.,Alas! our simple Seaman should have known
9441,THE BROTHERS.,"That all the care, the kindness, he had shown,"
9442,THE BROTHERS.,"Were from his Brother's heart, if not his memory, flown:"
9443,THE BROTHERS.,"All swept away, to be perceived no more,"
9444,THE BROTHERS.,"Like idle structures on the sandy shore,"
9445,THE BROTHERS.,"The chance amusement of the playful boy,"
9446,THE BROTHERS.,That the rude billows in their rage destroy.
9447,THE BROTHERS.,"Poor George confess'd, though loth the truth to find,"
9448,THE BROTHERS.,Slight was his knowledge of a Brother's mind:
9449,THE BROTHERS.,"The vulgar pipe was to the wife offence,"
9450,THE BROTHERS.,The frequent grog to Isaac an expense;
9451,THE BROTHERS.,"Would friends like hers, she question'd, ""choose to come"
9452,THE BROTHERS.,Where clouds of poison'd fume defiled a room?
9453,THE BROTHERS.,"This could their Lady-friend, and Burgess Steel"
9454,THE BROTHERS.,"(Teased with his worship's asthma), bear to feel?"
9455,THE BROTHERS.,Could they associate or converse with him -
9456,THE BROTHERS.,"A loud rough sailor with a timber limb?"""
9457,THE BROTHERS.,"Cold as he grew, still Isaac strove to show,"
9458,THE BROTHERS.,"By well-feign'd care, that cold he could not grow;"
9459,THE BROTHERS.,"And when he saw his brother look distress'd,"
9460,THE BROTHERS.,He strove some petty comforts to suggest;
9461,THE BROTHERS.,"On his wife solely their neglect to lay,"
9462,THE BROTHERS.,"And then t'excuse it, as a woman's way;"
9463,THE BROTHERS.,"He too was chidden when her rules he broke,"
9464,THE BROTHERS.,And when she sicken'd at the scent of smoke.
9465,THE BROTHERS.,"George, though in doubt, was still consoled to find"
9466,THE BROTHERS.,His Brother wishing to be reckoned kind:
9467,THE BROTHERS.,"That Isaac seem'd concern'd by his distress,"
9468,THE BROTHERS.,Gave to his injured feelings some redress;
9469,THE BROTHERS.,But none he found disposed to lend an ear
9470,THE BROTHERS.,"To stories, all were once intent to hear:"
9471,THE BROTHERS.,"Except his nephew, seated on his knee,"
9472,THE BROTHERS.,He found no creature cared about the sea;
9473,THE BROTHERS.,"But George indeed--for George they call'd the boy,"
9474,THE BROTHERS.,When his good uncle was their boast and joy -
9475,THE BROTHERS.,"Would listen long, and would contend with sleep,"
9476,THE BROTHERS.,To hear the woes and wonders of the deep;
9477,THE BROTHERS.,"Till the fond mother cried--""That man will teach"
9478,THE BROTHERS.,"The foolish boy his rude and boisterous speech."""
9479,THE BROTHERS.,So judged the father--and the boy was taught
9480,THE BROTHERS.,"To shun the uncle, whom his love had sought."
9481,THE BROTHERS.,"The mask of kindness now but seldom worn,"
9482,THE BROTHERS.,George felt each evil harder to be borne;
9483,THE BROTHERS.,"And cried (vexation growing day by day),"
9484,THE BROTHERS.,"""Ah! brother Isaac!  What!  I'm in the way!"""
9485,THE BROTHERS.,"""No! on my credit, look ye, No! but I"
9486,THE BROTHERS.,"Am fond of peace, and my repose would buy"
9487,THE BROTHERS.,"On any terms--in short, we must comply:"
9488,THE BROTHERS.,My spouse had money--she must have her will -
9489,THE BROTHERS.,"Ah! brother, marriage is a bitter pill."""
9490,THE BROTHERS.,"George tried the lady--""Sister, I offend."""
9491,THE BROTHERS.,"""Me?"" she replied--""Oh no! you may depend"
9492,THE BROTHERS.,"On my regard--but watch your brother's way,"
9493,THE BROTHERS.,"Whom I, like you, must study and obey."""
9494,THE BROTHERS.,"""Ah!"" thought the Seaman, ""what a head was mine,"
9495,THE BROTHERS.,That easy berth at Greenwich to resign!
9496,THE BROTHERS.,"I'll to the parish""--but a little pride,"
9497,THE BROTHERS.,"And some affection, put the thought aside."
9498,THE BROTHERS.,Now gross neglect and open scorn he bore
9499,THE BROTHERS.,In silent sorrow--but he felt the more:
9500,THE BROTHERS.,"The odious pipe he to the kitchen took,"
9501,THE BROTHERS.,Or strove to profit by some pious book.
9502,THE BROTHERS.,"When the mind stoops to this degraded state,"
9503,THE BROTHERS.,New griefs will darken the dependant's fate;
9504,THE BROTHERS.,"""Brother!"" said Isaac, ""you will sure excuse"
9505,THE BROTHERS.,The little freedom I'm compell'd to use:
9506,THE BROTHERS.,My wife's relations--(curse the haughty crew!) -
9507,THE BROTHERS.,"Affect such niceness, and such dread of you:"
9508,THE BROTHERS.,You speak so loud--and they have natures soft -
9509,THE BROTHERS.,"Brother--I wish--do go upon the loft!"""
9510,THE BROTHERS.,"Poor George obey'd, and to the garret fled,"
9511,THE BROTHERS.,Where not a being saw the tears he shed:
9512,THE BROTHERS.,"But more was yet required, for guests were come,"
9513,THE BROTHERS.,Who could not dine if he disgraced the room.
9514,THE BROTHERS.,It shock'd his spirit to be esteem'd unfit
9515,THE BROTHERS.,With an own brother and his wife to sit;
9516,THE BROTHERS.,He grew rebellious--at the vestry spoke
9517,THE BROTHERS.,For weekly aid--they heard it as a joke:
9518,THE BROTHERS.,"""So kind a brother, and so wealthy--you"
9519,THE BROTHERS.,Apply to us?--No! this will never do:
9520,THE BROTHERS.,"Good neighbour Fletcher,"" said the Overseer,"
9521,THE BROTHERS.,"""We are engaged--you can have nothing here!"""
9522,THE BROTHERS.,"George mutter'd something in despairing tone,"
9523,THE BROTHERS.,"Then sought his loft, to think and grieve alone;"
9524,THE BROTHERS.,"Neglected, slighted, restless on his bed,"
9525,THE BROTHERS.,"With heart half broken, and with scraps ill fed;"
9526,THE BROTHERS.,Yet was he pleased that hours for play design'd
9527,THE BROTHERS.,Were given to ease his ever-troubled mind;
9528,THE BROTHERS.,"The child still listen'd with increasing joy,"
9529,THE BROTHERS.,And he was sooth'd by the attentive boy.
9530,THE BROTHERS.,"At length he sicken'd, and this duteous child"
9531,THE BROTHERS.,"Watch'd o'er his sickness, and his pains beguiled;"
9532,THE BROTHERS.,"The mother bade him from the loft refrain,"
9533,THE BROTHERS.,"But, though with caution, yet he went again;"
9534,THE BROTHERS.,"And now his tales the Sailor feebly told,"
9535,THE BROTHERS.,"His heart was heavy, and his limbs were cold:"
9536,THE BROTHERS.,The tender boy came often to entreat
9537,THE BROTHERS.,His good kind friend would of his presents eat;
9538,THE BROTHERS.,"Purloin'd or purchased, for he saw, with shame,"
9539,THE BROTHERS.,The food untouch'd that to his uncle came;
9540,THE BROTHERS.,"Who, sick in body and in mind, received"
9541,THE BROTHERS.,"The boy's indulgence, gratified and grieved."
9542,THE BROTHERS.,"""Uncle will die!"" said George: --the piteous wife"
9543,THE BROTHERS.,"Exclaim'd, ""she saw no value in his life;"
9544,THE BROTHERS.,"But, sick or well, to my commands attend,"
9545,THE BROTHERS.,"And go no more to your complaining friend."""
9546,THE BROTHERS.,"The boy was vex'd, he felt his heart reprove"
9547,THE BROTHERS.,The stern decree.--What! punish'd for his love!
9548,THE BROTHERS.,"No! he would go, but softly, to the room,"
9549,THE BROTHERS.,Stealing in silence--for he knew his doom.
9550,THE BROTHERS.,"Once in a week the father came to say,"
9551,THE BROTHERS.,"""George, are you ill?"" and hurried him away;"
9552,THE BROTHERS.,"Yet to his wife would on their duties dwell,"
9553,THE BROTHERS.,"And often cry, ""Do use my brother well:"""
9554,THE BROTHERS.,"And something kind, no question, Isaac meant,"
9555,THE BROTHERS.,Who took vast credit for the vague intent.
9556,THE BROTHERS.,"But, truly kind, the gentle boy essay'd"
9557,THE BROTHERS.,"To cheer his uncle, firm, although afraid;"
9558,THE BROTHERS.,"But now the father caught him at the door,"
9559,THE BROTHERS.,"And, swearing--yes, the man in office swore,"
9560,THE BROTHERS.,"And cried, ""Away!  How!  Brother, I'm surprised"
9561,THE BROTHERS.,That one so old can be so ill advised:
9562,THE BROTHERS.,"Let him not dare to visit you again,"
9563,THE BROTHERS.,Your cursed stories will disturb his brain;
9564,THE BROTHERS.,"Is it not vile to court a foolish boy,"
9565,THE BROTHERS.,Your own absurd narrations to enjoy?
9566,THE BROTHERS.,"What! sullen!--ha, George Fletcher! you shall see,"
9567,THE BROTHERS.,"Proud as you are, your bread depends on me!"""
9568,THE BROTHERS.,"He spoke, and, frowning, to his dinner went,"
9569,THE BROTHERS.,Then cool'd and felt some qualms of discontent:
9570,THE BROTHERS.,And thought on times when he compell'd his son
9571,THE BROTHERS.,"To hear these stories, nay, to beg for one;"
9572,THE BROTHERS.,"But the wife's wrath o'ercame the brother's pain,"
9573,THE BROTHERS.,"And shame was felt, and conscience rose, in vain."
9574,THE BROTHERS.,George yet stole up; he saw his Uncle lie
9575,THE BROTHERS.,"Sick on the bed, and heard his heavy sigh;"
9576,THE BROTHERS.,"So he resolved, before he went to rest,"
9577,THE BROTHERS.,To comfort one so dear and so distressed;
9578,THE BROTHERS.,"Then watch'd his time, but, with a child-like art,"
9579,THE BROTHERS.,Betray'd a something treasured at his heart:
9580,THE BROTHERS.,"Th' observant wife remark'd, ""The boy is grown"
9581,THE BROTHERS.,"So like your brother, that he seems his own:"
9582,THE BROTHERS.,So close and sullen! and I still suspect
9583,THE BROTHERS.,"They often meet: --do watch them and detect."""
9584,THE BROTHERS.,"George now remark'd that all was still as night,"
9585,THE BROTHERS.,And hasten'd up with terror and delight;
9586,THE BROTHERS.,"""Uncle!"" he cried, and softly tapp'd the door,"
9587,THE BROTHERS.,"Do let me in""--but he could add no more;"
9588,THE BROTHERS.,"The careful father caught him in the fact,"
9589,THE BROTHERS.,"And cried,--""You serpent! is it thus you act?"
9590,THE BROTHERS.,"""Back to your mother!""--and, with hasty blow,"
9591,THE BROTHERS.,He sent th' indignant boy to grieve below;
9592,THE BROTHERS.,Then at the door an angry speech began -
9593,THE BROTHERS.,"""Is this your conduct?--Is it thus you plan?"
9594,THE BROTHERS.,"Seduce my child, and make my house a scene"
9595,THE BROTHERS.,Of vile dispute--What is it that you mean?
9596,THE BROTHERS.,"George, are you dumb? do learn to know your friends,"
9597,THE BROTHERS.,And think a while on whom your bread depends.
9598,THE BROTHERS.,What! not a word? be thankful I am cool -
9599,THE BROTHERS.,"But, sir, beware, nor longer play the fool."
9600,THE BROTHERS.,"Come! brother, come! what is it that you seek"
9601,THE BROTHERS.,"By this rebellion?--Speak, you villain, speak!"
9602,THE BROTHERS.,Weeping! I warrant--sorrow makes you dumb:
9603,THE BROTHERS.,"I'll ope your mouth, impostor! if I come:"
9604,THE BROTHERS.,"Let me approach--I'll shake you from the bed,"
9605,THE BROTHERS.,"You stubborn dog--Oh God! my Brother's dead!"""
9606,THE BROTHERS.,"Timid was Isaac, and in all the past"
9607,THE BROTHERS.,He felt a purpose to be kind at last:
9608,THE BROTHERS.,"Nor did he mean his brother to depart,"
9609,THE BROTHERS.,Till he had shown this kindness of his heart;
9610,THE BROTHERS.,"But day by day he put the cause aside,"
9611,THE BROTHERS.,"Induced by av'rice, peevishness, or pride."
9612,THE BROTHERS.,"But now awaken'd, from this fatal time"
9613,THE BROTHERS.,"His conscience Isaac felt, and found his crime:"
9614,THE BROTHERS.,"He raised to George a monumental stone,"
9615,THE BROTHERS.,And there retired to sigh and think alone;
9616,THE BROTHERS.,"An ague seized him, he grew pale, and shook -"
9617,THE BROTHERS.,"""So,"" said his son, ""would my poor Uncle look."""
9618,THE BROTHERS.,"""And so, my child, shall I like him expire."""
9619,THE BROTHERS.,"""No! you have physic and a cheerful fire."""
9620,THE BROTHERS.,"""Unhappy sinner! yes, I'm well supplied"
9621,THE BROTHERS.,"With every comfort my cold heart denied."""
9622,THE BROTHERS.,"He view'd his Brother now, but not as one"
9623,THE BROTHERS.,Who vex'd his wife by fondness for her son;
9624,THE BROTHERS.,"Not as with wooden limb, and seaman's tale,"
9625,THE BROTHERS.,"The odious pipe, vile grog, or humbler ale:"
9626,THE BROTHERS.,He now the worth and grief alone can view
9627,THE BROTHERS.,"Of one so mild, so generous, and so true;"
9628,THE BROTHERS.,"""The frank, kind Brother, with such open heart, -"
9629,THE BROTHERS.,"And I to break it--'twas a demon's part!"""
9630,THE BROTHERS.,"So Isaac now, as led by conscience, feels,"
9631,THE BROTHERS.,Nor his unkindness palliates or conceals;
9632,THE BROTHERS.,"""This is your folly,"" said his heartless wife:"
9633,THE BROTHERS.,"""Alas! my folly cost my Brother's life;"
9634,THE BROTHERS.,It suffer'd him to languish and decay -
9635,THE BROTHERS.,"My gentle Brother, whom I could not pay,"
9636,THE BROTHERS.,"And therefore left to pine, and fret his life away!"""
9637,THE BROTHERS.,"He takes his Son, and bids the boy unfold"
9638,THE BROTHERS.,"All the good Uncle of his feelings told,"
9639,THE BROTHERS.,All he lamented--and the ready tear
9640,THE BROTHERS.,"Falls as he listens, soothed, and grieved to hear."
9641,THE BROTHERS.,"""Did he not curse me, child?""--""He never cursed,"
9642,THE BROTHERS.,"But could not breathe, and said his heart would burst."""
9643,THE BROTHERS.,"""And so will mine:""--""Then, father, you must pray:"
9644,THE BROTHERS.,"My uncle said it took his pains away."""
9645,THE BROTHERS.,"Repeating thus his sorrows, Isaac shows"
9646,THE BROTHERS.,"That he, repenting, feels the debt he owes,"
9647,THE BROTHERS.,And from this source alone his every comfort flows.
9648,THE BROTHERS.,"He takes no joy in office, honours, gain;"
9649,THE BROTHERS.,"They make him humble, nay, they give him pain:"
9650,THE BROTHERS.,"""These from my heart,"" he cries, ""all feeling drove;"
9651,THE BROTHERS.,"They made me cold to nature, dead to love."""
9652,THE BROTHERS.,"He takes no joy in home, but sighing, sees"
9653,THE BROTHERS.,"A son in sorrow, and a wife at ease;"
9654,THE BROTHERS.,"He takes no joy in office--see him now,"
9655,THE BROTHERS.,And Burgess Steel has but a passing bow;
9656,THE BROTHERS.,"Of one sad train of gloomy thoughts possess'd,"
9657,THE BROTHERS.,"He takes no joy in friends, in food, in rest -"

9694,THE LEARNED BOY.,
9695,THE LEARNED BOY.,"An honest man was Farmer Jones, and true;"
9696,THE LEARNED BOY.,He did by all as all by him should do;
9697,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Grave, cautious, careful, fond of gain was he,"
9698,THE LEARNED BOY.,Yet famed for rustic hospitality:
9699,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Left with his children in a widow'd state,"
9700,THE LEARNED BOY.,The quiet man submitted to his fate;
9701,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Though prudent matrons waited for his call,"
9702,THE LEARNED BOY.,With cool forbearance he avoided all;
9703,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Though each profess'd a pure maternal joy,"
9704,THE LEARNED BOY.,By kind attention to his feeble boy;
9705,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And though a friendly Widow knew no rest,"
9706,THE LEARNED BOY.,Whilst neighbour Jones was lonely and distress'd;
9707,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Nay, though the maidens spoke in tender tone"
9708,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Their hearts' concern to see him left alone,"
9709,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Jones still persisted in that cheerless life,"
9710,THE LEARNED BOY.,As if 'twere sin to take a second wife.
9711,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Oh! 'tis a precious thing, when wives are dead,"
9712,THE LEARNED BOY.,To find such numbers who will serve instead;
9713,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And in whatever state a man be thrown,"
9714,THE LEARNED BOY.,'Tis that precisely they would wish their own;
9715,THE LEARNED BOY.,Left the departed infants--then their joy
9716,THE LEARNED BOY.,Is to sustain each lovely girl and boy:
9717,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Whatever calling his, whatever trade,"
9718,THE LEARNED BOY.,To that their chief attention has been paid;
9719,THE LEARNED BOY.,"His happy taste in all things they approve,"
9720,THE LEARNED BOY.,"His friends they honour, and his food they love;"
9721,THE LEARNED BOY.,"His wish for order, prudence in affairs,"
9722,THE LEARNED BOY.,"An equal temper (thank their stars!), are theirs;"
9723,THE LEARNED BOY.,"In fact, it seem'd to be a thing decreed,"
9724,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And fix'd as fate, that marriage must succeed:"
9725,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Yet some, like Jones, with stubborn hearts and hard,"
9726,THE LEARNED BOY.,Can hear such claims and show them no regard.
9727,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Soon as our Farmer, like a general, found"
9728,THE LEARNED BOY.,"By what strong foes he was encompass'd round,"
9729,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Engage he dared not, and he could not fly,"
9730,THE LEARNED BOY.,But saw his hope in gentle parley lie;
9731,THE LEARNED BOY.,"With looks of kindness then, and trembling heart,"
9732,THE LEARNED BOY.,"He met the foe, and art opposed to art."
9733,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Now spoke that foe insidious--gentle tones,"
9734,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And gentle looks, assumed for Farmer Jones:"
9735,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Three girls,"" the Widow cried, ""a lively three"
9736,THE LEARNED BOY.,"To govern well--indeed it cannot be."""
9737,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Yes,"" he replied, ""it calls for pains and care:"
9738,THE LEARNED BOY.,"But I must bear it.""--""Sir, you cannot bear;"
9739,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Your son is weak, and asks a mother's eye:"""
9740,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""That, my kind friend, a father's may supply."""
9741,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Such growing griefs your very soul will tease;"""
9742,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""To grieve another would not give me ease -"
9743,THE LEARNED BOY.,"I have a mother,""--""She, poor ancient soul!"
9744,THE LEARNED BOY.,Can she the spirits of the young control?
9745,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Can she thy peace promote, partake thy care,"
9746,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Procure thy comforts, and thy sorrows share?"
9747,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Age is itself impatient, uncontroll'd:"""
9748,THE LEARNED BOY.,"But wives like mothers must at length be old."""
9749,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Thou hast shrewd servants--they are evils sore?"""
9750,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Yet a shrewd mistress might afflict me more."""
9751,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Wilt thou not be a weary, wailing man?"""
9752,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Alas! and I must bear it as I can."""
9753,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Resisted thus, the Widow soon withdrew,"
9754,THE LEARNED BOY.,That in his pride the Hero might pursue;
9755,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And off his wonted guard, in some retreat"
9756,THE LEARNED BOY.,Find from a foe prepared entire defeat:
9757,THE LEARNED BOY.,But he was prudent; for he knew in flight
9758,THE LEARNED BOY.,These Parthian warriors turn again and fight;
9759,THE LEARNED BOY.,"He but at freedom, not at glory aim'd,"
9760,THE LEARNED BOY.,And only safety by his caution claim'd.
9761,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Thus, when a great and powerful state decrees"
9762,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Upon a small one, in its love, to seize -"
9763,THE LEARNED BOY.,"It vows in kindness, to protect, defend,"
9764,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And be the fond ally, the faithful friend;"
9765,THE LEARNED BOY.,It therefore wills that humbler state to place
9766,THE LEARNED BOY.,Its hopes of safety in a fond embrace;
9767,THE LEARNED BOY.,Then must that humbler state its wisdom prove
9768,THE LEARNED BOY.,By kind rejection of such pressing love;
9769,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Must dread such dangerous friendship to commence,"
9770,THE LEARNED BOY.,And stand collected in its own defence:
9771,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Our Farmer thus the proffer'd kindness fled,"
9772,THE LEARNED BOY.,And shunn'd the love that into bondage led.
9773,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The Widow failing, fresh besiegers came,"
9774,THE LEARNED BOY.,To share the fate of this retiring dame:
9775,THE LEARNED BOY.,And each foresaw a thousand ills attend
9776,THE LEARNED BOY.,The man that fled from so discreet a friend;
9777,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And pray'd, kind soul! that no event might make"
9778,THE LEARNED BOY.,The harden'd heart of Farmer Jones to ache.
9779,THE LEARNED BOY.,"But he still govern'd with resistless hand,"
9780,THE LEARNED BOY.,And where he could not guide he would command:
9781,THE LEARNED BOY.,"With steady view, in course direct he steer'd,"
9782,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And his fair daughters loved him, though they fear'd;"
9783,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Each had her school, and as his wealth was known,"
9784,THE LEARNED BOY.,Each had in time a household of her own.
9785,THE LEARNED BOY.,The Boy indeed was at the Grandam's side
9786,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Humour'd and train'd, her trouble and her pride:"
9787,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Companions dear, with speech and spirits mild,"
9788,THE LEARNED BOY.,The childish widow and the vapourish child;
9789,THE LEARNED BOY.,This nature prompts; minds uninform'd and weak
9790,THE LEARNED BOY.,In such alliance ease and comfort seek:
9791,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Push'd by the levity of youth aside,"
9792,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The cares of man, his humour, or his pride,"
9793,THE LEARNED BOY.,"They feel, in their defenceless state, allied;"
9794,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The child is pleased to meet regard from age,"
9795,THE LEARNED BOY.,The old are pleased e'en children to engage;
9796,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And all their wisdom, scorn'd by proud mankind,"
9797,THE LEARNED BOY.,"They love to pour into the ductile mind,"
9798,THE LEARNED BOY.,"By its own weakness into error led,"
9799,THE LEARNED BOY.,And by fond age with prejudices fed.
9800,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The Father, thankful for the good he had,"
9801,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Yet saw with pain a whining, timid Lad;"
9802,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Whom he instructing led through cultured fields,"
9803,THE LEARNED BOY.,"To show what Man performs, what Nature yields:"
9804,THE LEARNED BOY.,"But Stephen, listless, wander'd from the view,"
9805,THE LEARNED BOY.,"From beasts he fled, for butterflies he flew,"
9806,THE LEARNED BOY.,And idly gazed about in search of something new.
9807,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The lambs indeed he loved, and wish'd to play"
9808,THE LEARNED BOY.,"With things so mild, so harmless, and so gay;"
9809,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Best pleased the weakest of the flock to see,"
9810,THE LEARNED BOY.,With whom he felt a sickly sympathy.
9811,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Meantime the Dame was anxious, day and night,"
9812,THE LEARNED BOY.,"To guide the notions of her babe aright,"
9813,THE LEARNED BOY.,And on the favourite mind to throw her glimmering light;
9814,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Her Bible-stories she impress'd betimes,"
9815,THE LEARNED BOY.,And fill'd his head with hymns and holy rhymes;
9816,THE LEARNED BOY.,"On powers unseen, the good and ill, she dwelt,"
9817,THE LEARNED BOY.,And the poor Boy mysterious terrors felt;
9818,THE LEARNED BOY.,"From frightful dreams he waking sobb'd in dread,"
9819,THE LEARNED BOY.,Till the good lady came to guard his bed.
9820,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The Father wish'd such errors to correct,"
9821,THE LEARNED BOY.,But let them pass in duty and respect:
9822,THE LEARNED BOY.,But more it grieved his worthy mind to see
9823,THE LEARNED BOY.,That Stephen never would a farmer be:
9824,THE LEARNED BOY.,"In vain he tried the shiftless Lad to guide,"
9825,THE LEARNED BOY.,And yet 'twas time that something should be tried:
9826,THE LEARNED BOY.,He at the village-school perchance might gain
9827,THE LEARNED BOY.,All that such mind could gather and retain;
9828,THE LEARNED BOY.,Yet the good Dame affirm'd her favourite child
9829,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Was apt and studious, though sedate and mild;"
9830,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""That he on many a learned point could speak,"
9831,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And that his body, not his mind, was weak."""
9832,THE LEARNED BOY.,The Father doubted--but to school was sent
9833,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The timid Stephen, weeping as he went:"
9834,THE LEARNED BOY.,"There the rude lads compell'd the child to fight,"
9835,THE LEARNED BOY.,And sent him bleeding to his home at night;
9836,THE LEARNED BOY.,At this the Grandam more indulgent grew;
9837,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And bade her Darling ""shun the beastly crew,"
9838,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Whom Satan ruled, and who were sure to lie"
9839,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Howling in torments, when they came to die."""
9840,THE LEARNED BOY.,"This was such comfort, that in high disdain"
9841,THE LEARNED BOY.,"He told their fate, and felt their blows again:"
9842,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Yet if the Boy had not a hero's heart,"
9843,THE LEARNED BOY.,Within the school he play'd a better part;
9844,THE LEARNED BOY.,"He wrote a clean fine hand, and at his slate"
9845,THE LEARNED BOY.,With more success than many a hero sate;
9846,THE LEARNED BOY.,He thought not much indeed--but what depends
9847,THE LEARNED BOY.,On pains and care was at his fingers' ends.
9848,THE LEARNED BOY.,"This had his Father's praise, who now espied"
9849,THE LEARNED BOY.,"A spark of merit, with a blaze of pride;"
9850,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And though a farmer he would never make,"
9851,THE LEARNED BOY.,He might a pen with some advantage take;
9852,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And as a clerk that instrument employ,"
9853,THE LEARNED BOY.,So well adapted to a timid boy.
9854,THE LEARNED BOY.,"A London Cousin soon a place obtain'd,"
9855,THE LEARNED BOY.,Easy but humble--little could be gain'd:
9856,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The time arrived when youth and age must part,"
9857,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Tears in each eye, and sorrow in each heart;"
9858,THE LEARNED BOY.,The careful Father bade his Son attend
9859,THE LEARNED BOY.,To all his duties and obey his Friend;
9860,THE LEARNED BOY.,"To keep his church and there behave aright,"
9861,THE LEARNED BOY.,"As one existing in his Maker's sight,"
9862,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Till acts to habits led, and duty to delight."
9863,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Then try, my boy, as quickly as you can,"
9864,THE LEARNED BOY.,T'assume the looks and spirit of a man;
9865,THE LEARNED BOY.,"I say, be honest, faithful, civil, true,"
9866,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And this you may, and yet have courage too:"
9867,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Heroic men, their country's boast and pride,"
9868,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Have fear'd their God, and nothing fear'd beside;"
9869,THE LEARNED BOY.,"While others daring, yet imbecile, fly"
9870,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The power of man, and that of God defy:"
9871,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Be manly, then, though mild, for, sure as fate,"
9872,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Thou art, my Stephen, too effeminate;"
9873,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Here, take my purse, and make a worthy use"
9874,THE LEARNED BOY.,('Tis fairly stock'd) of what it will produce:
9875,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And now my blessing, not as any charm"
9876,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Or conjuration; but 'twill do no harm."""
9877,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Stephen, whose thoughts were wandering up and down,"
9878,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Now charm'd with promised sights in London-town,"
9879,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Now loth to leave his Grandam--lost the force,"
9880,THE LEARNED BOY.,The drift and tenor of this grave discourse;
9881,THE LEARNED BOY.,"But, in a general way, he understood"
9882,THE LEARNED BOY.,"'Twas good advice, and meant, ""My son be good;"""
9883,THE LEARNED BOY.,And Stephen knew that all such precepts mean
9884,THE LEARNED BOY.,"That lads should read their Bible, and be clean."
9885,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The good old Lady, though in some distress,"
9886,THE LEARNED BOY.,Begg'd her dear Stephen would his grief suppress:
9887,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Nay, dry those eyes, my child--and, first of all."
9888,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Hold fast thy faith, whatever may befall:'"
9889,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Hear the best preacher, and preserve the text"
9890,THE LEARNED BOY.,For meditation till you hear the next;
9891,THE LEARNED BOY.,Within your Bible night and morning look -
9892,THE LEARNED BOY.,"There is your duty, read no other book;"
9893,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Be not in crowds, in broils, in riots seen,"
9894,THE LEARNED BOY.,And keep your conscience and your linen clean:
9895,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Be you a Joseph, and the time may be"
9896,THE LEARNED BOY.,"When kings and rulers will be ruled by thee."""
9897,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Nay,"" said the Father--""Hush, my son!"" replied"
9898,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The Dame--""the Scriptures must not be denied."""
9899,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The Lad, still weeping, heard the wheels approach,"
9900,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And took his place within the evening coach,"
9901,THE LEARNED BOY.,With heart quite rent asunder:  on one side
9902,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Was love, and grief, and fear, for scenes untried;"
9903,THE LEARNED BOY.,Wild beasts and wax-work fill'd the happier part
9904,THE LEARNED BOY.,Of Stephen's varying and divided heart:
9905,THE LEARNED BOY.,"This he betray'd by sighs and questions strange,"
9906,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Of famous shows, the Tower, and the Exchange."
9907,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Soon at his desk was placed the curious Boy,"
9908,THE LEARNED BOY.,Demure and silent at his new employ;
9909,THE LEARNED BOY.,Yet as he could he much attention paid
9910,THE LEARNED BOY.,"To all around him, cautious and afraid;"
9911,THE LEARNED BOY.,"On older Clerks his eager eyes were fix'd,"
9912,THE LEARNED BOY.,But Stephen never in their council mix'd:
9913,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Much their contempt he fear'd, for if like them,"
9914,THE LEARNED BOY.,He felt assured he should himself contemn;
9915,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Oh! they were all so eloquent, so free,"
9916,THE LEARNED BOY.,No! he was nothing--nothing could he be:
9917,THE LEARNED BOY.,"They dress so smartly, and so boldly look,"
9918,THE LEARNED BOY.,And talk as if they read it from a book;
9919,THE LEARNED BOY.,"But I,"" said Stephen, ""will forbear to speak,"
9920,THE LEARNED BOY.,And they will think me prudent and not weak.
9921,THE LEARNED BOY.,"They talk, the instant they have dropp'd the pen,"
9922,THE LEARNED BOY.,Of singing-women and of acting-men:
9923,THE LEARNED BOY.,Of plays and places where at night they walk
9924,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Beneath the lamps, and with the ladies talk;"
9925,THE LEARNED BOY.,"While other ladies for their pleasure sing, -"
9926,THE LEARNED BOY.,Oh! 'tis a glorious and a happy thing:
9927,THE LEARNED BOY.,"They would despise me, did they understand"
9928,THE LEARNED BOY.,I dare not look upon a scene so grand;
9929,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Or see the plays when critics rise and roar,"
9930,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And hiss and groan, and cry--Encore! encore!"
9931,THE LEARNED BOY.,There's one among them looks a little kind;
9932,THE LEARNED BOY.,"If more encouraged, I would ope my mind."""
9933,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Alas! poor Stephen, happier had he kept"
9934,THE LEARNED BOY.,"His purpose secret, while his envy slept!"
9935,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Virtue perhaps had conquer'd, or his shame"
9936,THE LEARNED BOY.,At least preserved him simple as he came.
9937,THE LEARNED BOY.,A year elapsed before this Clerk began
9938,THE LEARNED BOY.,To treat the rustic something like a man;
9939,THE LEARNED BOY.,"He then in trifling points the youth advised,"
9940,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Talk'd of his coat, and had it modernized;"
9941,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Or with the lad a Sunday-walk would take,"
9942,THE LEARNED BOY.,And kindly strive his passions to awake;
9943,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Meanwhile explaining all they heard and saw,"
9944,THE LEARNED BOY.,Till Stephen stood in wonderment and awe;
9945,THE LEARNED BOY.,"To a neat garden near the town they stray'd,"
9946,THE LEARNED BOY.,Where the Lad felt delighted and afraid;
9947,THE LEARNED BOY.,"There all he saw was smart, and fine, and fair -"
9948,THE LEARNED BOY.,He could but marvel how he ventured there:
9949,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Soon he observed, with terror and alarm,"
9950,THE LEARNED BOY.,"His friend enlocked within a Lady's arm,"
9951,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And freely talking--""But it is,"" said he,"
9952,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""A near relation, and that makes him free;"""
9953,THE LEARNED BOY.,And much amazed was Stephen when he knew
9954,THE LEARNED BOY.,This was the first and only interview;
9955,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Nay, had that lovely arm by him been seized,"
9956,THE LEARNED BOY.,The lovely owner had been highly pleased.
9957,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Alas!"" he sigh'd, ""I never can contrive"
9958,THE LEARNED BOY.,"At such bold, blessed freedoms to arrive;"
9959,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Never shall I such happy courage boast,"
9960,THE LEARNED BOY.,"I dare as soon encounter with a ghost."""
9961,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Now to a play the friendly couple went,"
9962,THE LEARNED BOY.,But the Boy murmurd at the money spent;
9963,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""He lov'd,"" he said, ""to buy, but not to spend -"
9964,THE LEARNED BOY.,"They only talk awhile, and there's an end."""
9965,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Come, you shall purchase books,"" the Friend replied;"
9966,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""You are bewilder'd, and you want a guide;"
9967,THE LEARNED BOY.,"To me refer the choice, and you shall find"
9968,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The light break in upon your stagnant mind!"""
9969,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The cooler Clerks exclaim'd, ""In vain your art"
9970,THE LEARNED BOY.,To improve a cub without a head or heart;
9971,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Rustics, though coarse, and savages, though wild,"
9972,THE LEARNED BOY.,Our cares may render liberal and mild:
9973,THE LEARNED BOY.,"But what, my friend, can flow from all these pains?"
9974,THE LEARNED BOY.,"There is no dealing with a lack of brains."""
9975,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""True I am hopeless to behold him man,"
9976,THE LEARNED BOY.,But let me make the booby what I can:
9977,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Though the rude stone no polish will display,"
9978,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Yet you may strip the rugged coat away."""
9979,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Stephen beheld his books--""I love to know"
9980,THE LEARNED BOY.,How money goes--now here is that to show:
9981,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And now"" he cried, ""I shall be pleased to get"
9982,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Beyond the Bible--there I puzzle yet."""
9983,THE LEARNED BOY.,"He spoke abash'd--""Nay, nay!"" the friend replied,"
9984,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""You need not lay the good old book aside;"
9985,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Antique and curious, I myself indeed"
9986,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Read it at times, but as a man should read;."
9987,THE LEARNED BOY.,"A fine old work it is, and I protest"
9988,THE LEARNED BOY.,I hate to hear it treated as a jest:
9989,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The book has wisdom in it, if you look"
9990,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Wisely upon it, as another book:"
9991,THE LEARNED BOY.,For superstition (as our priests of sin
9992,THE LEARNED BOY.,Are pleased to tell us) makes us blind within;
9993,THE LEARNED BOY.,Of this hereafter--we will now select
9994,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Some works to please you, others to direct;"
9995,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Tales and romances shall your fancy feed,"
9996,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And reasoners form your morals and your creed."""
9997,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The books were view'd, the price was fairly paid,"
9998,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And Stephen read undaunted, undismay'd:"
9999,THE LEARNED BOY.,"But not till first he papered all the row,"
10000,THE LEARNED BOY.,And placed in order to enjoy the show:
10001,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Next letter'd all the backs with care and speed,"
10002,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Set them in ranks, and then began to read."
10003,THE LEARNED BOY.,The love of Order--I the thing receive
10004,THE LEARNED BOY.,"From reverend men, and I in part believe -"
10005,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Shows a clear mind and clean, and whoso needs"
10006,THE LEARNED BOY.,"This love, but seldom in the world succeeds;"
10007,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And yet with this some other love must be,"
10008,THE LEARNED BOY.,Ere I can fully to the fact agree;
10009,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Valour and study may by order gain,"
10010,THE LEARNED BOY.,By order sovereigns hold more steady reign;
10011,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Through all the tribes of nature order runs,"
10012,THE LEARNED BOY.,And rules around in systems and in suns:
10013,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Still has the love of order found a place,"
10014,THE LEARNED BOY.,"With all that's low, degrading, mean, and base,"
10015,THE LEARNED BOY.,"With all that merits scorn, and all that meets disgrace -"
10016,THE LEARNED BOY.,"In the cold miser, of all change afraid;"
10017,THE LEARNED BOY.,In pompous men in public seats obey'd;
10018,THE LEARNED BOY.,"In humble placemen, heralds, solemn drones,"
10019,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Fanciers of flowers, and lads like Stephen Jones:"
10020,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Order to these is armour and defence,"
10021,THE LEARNED BOY.,And love of method serves in lack of sense.
10022,THE LEARNED BOY.,For rustic youth could I a list produce
10023,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Of Stephen's books, how great might be the use!"
10024,THE LEARNED BOY.,"But evil fate was theirs--survey'd, enjoy'd"
10025,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Some happy months, and then by force destroyed:"
10026,THE LEARNED BOY.,So will'd the Fates--but these with patience read
10027,THE LEARNED BOY.,Had vast effect on Stephen's heart and head.
10028,THE LEARNED BOY.,This soon appear'd:  within a single week
10029,THE LEARNED BOY.,"He oped his lips, and made attempt to speak;"
10030,THE LEARNED BOY.,He fail'd indeed--but still his Friend confess'd
10031,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The best have fail'd, and he had done his best:"
10032,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The first of swimmers, when at first he swims,"
10033,THE LEARNED BOY.,Has little use or freedom in his limbs;
10034,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Nay, when at length he strikes with manly force,"
10035,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The cramp may seize him, and impede his course."
10036,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Encouraged thus, our Clerk again essay'd"
10037,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The daring act, though daunted and afraid:"
10038,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Succeeding now, though partial his success,"
10039,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And pertness mark'd his manner and address,"
10040,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Yet such improvement issued from his books,"
10041,THE LEARNED BOY.,That all discern'd it in his speech and looks:
10042,THE LEARNED BOY.,"He ventured then on every theme to speak,"
10043,THE LEARNED BOY.,And felt no feverish tingling in his cheek;
10044,THE LEARNED BOY.,"His friend, approving, hail'd the happy change,"
10045,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The Clerks exclaim'd--""'Tis famous, and 'tis strange."""
10046,THE LEARNED BOY.,Two years had pass'd; the Youth attended still
10047,THE LEARNED BOY.,(Though thus accomplish'd) with a ready quill:
10048,THE LEARNED BOY.,"He sat th' allotted hours, though hard the case,"
10049,THE LEARNED BOY.,While timid prudence ruled in virtue's place;
10050,THE LEARNED BOY.,"By promise bound, the Son his letters penn'd"
10051,THE LEARNED BOY.,To his good parent at the quarter's end.
10052,THE LEARNED BOY.,"At first he sent those lines, the state to tell"
10053,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Of his own health, and hoped his friends were well;"
10054,THE LEARNED BOY.,"He kept their virtuous precepts in his mind,"
10055,THE LEARNED BOY.,And needed nothing--then his name was sign'd:
10056,THE LEARNED BOY.,"But now he wrote of Sunday-walks and views,"
10057,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Of actors' names, choice novels, and strange news;"
10058,THE LEARNED BOY.,"How coats were cut, and of his urgent need"
10059,THE LEARNED BOY.,"For fresh supply, which he desired with speed."
10060,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The Father doubted, when these letters came,"
10061,THE LEARNED BOY.,"To what they tended, yet was loth to blame:"
10062,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Stephen was once my duteous son, and now"
10063,THE LEARNED BOY.,My most obedient--this can I allow?
10064,THE LEARNED BOY.,Can I with pleasure or with patience see
10065,THE LEARNED BOY.,"A boy at once so heartless and so free?"""
10066,THE LEARNED BOY.,"But soon the kinsman heavy tidings told,"
10067,THE LEARNED BOY.,That love and prudence could no more withhold:
10068,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Stephen, though steady at his desk, was grown"
10069,THE LEARNED BOY.,A rake and coxcomb--this he grieved to own;
10070,THE LEARNED BOY.,"His cousin left his church, and spent the day"
10071,THE LEARNED BOY.,Lounging about in quite a heathen way;
10072,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Sometimes he swore, but had indeed the grace"
10073,THE LEARNED BOY.,To show the shame imprinted on his face:
10074,THE LEARNED BOY.,"I search'd his room, and in his absence read"
10075,THE LEARNED BOY.,Books that I knew would turn a stronger head.
10076,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The works of atheists half the number made,"
10077,THE LEARNED BOY.,The rest were lives of harlots leaving trade;
10078,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Which neither man nor boy would deign to read,"
10079,THE LEARNED BOY.,If from the scandal and pollution freed:
10080,THE LEARNED BOY.,"I sometimes threaten'd, and would fairly state"
10081,THE LEARNED BOY.,My sense of things so vile and profligate;
10082,THE LEARNED BOY.,"But I'm a cit, such works are lost on me -"
10083,THE LEARNED BOY.,"They're knowledge, and (good Lord!) philosophy."""
10084,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Oh, send him down,"" the Father soon replied;"
10085,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Let me behold him, and my skill be tried:"
10086,THE LEARNED BOY.,"If care and kindness lose their wonted use,"
10087,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Some rougher medicine will the end produce."""
10088,THE LEARNED BOY.,Stephen with grief and anger heard his doom -
10089,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Go to the farmer? to the rustic's home?"
10090,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Curse the base threat'ning--"" ""Nay, child, never curse;"
10091,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Corrupted long, your case is growing worse."""
10092,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""I!"" quoth the youth; ""I challenge all mankind"
10093,THE LEARNED BOY.,To find a fault; what fault have you to find?
10094,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Improve I not in manner, speech, and grace?"
10095,THE LEARNED BOY.,Inquire--my friends will tell it to your face;
10096,THE LEARNED BOY.,Have I been taught to guard his kine and sheep?
10097,THE LEARNED BOY.,A man like me has other things to keep;
10098,THE LEARNED BOY.,"This let him know.""--""It would his wrath excite:"
10099,THE LEARNED BOY.,"But come, prepare, you must away to-night."""
10100,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""What! leave my studies, my improvements leave,"
10101,THE LEARNED BOY.,"My faithful friends and intimates to grieve?"""
10102,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Go to your father, Stephen, let him see"
10103,THE LEARNED BOY.,"All these improvements; they are lost on me."""
10104,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The Youth, though loth, obey'd, and soon he saw"
10105,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The Farmer-father, with some signs of awe;"
10106,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Who, kind, yet silent, waited to behold"
10107,THE LEARNED BOY.,"How one would act, so daring, yet so cold:"
10108,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And soon he found, between the friendly pair"
10109,THE LEARNED BOY.,That secrets pass'd which he was not to share;
10110,THE LEARNED BOY.,"But he resolved those secrets to obtain,"
10111,THE LEARNED BOY.,And quash rebellion in his lawful reign.
10112,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Stephen, though vain, was with his father mute;"
10113,THE LEARNED BOY.,"He fear'd a crisis, and he shunn'd dispute;"
10114,THE LEARNED BOY.,And yet he long'd with youthful pride to show
10115,THE LEARNED BOY.,He knew such things as farmers could not know;
10116,THE LEARNED BOY.,"These to the Grandam he with freedom spoke,"
10117,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Saw her amazement, and enjoy'd the joke:"
10118,THE LEARNED BOY.,"But on the father when he cast his eye,"
10119,THE LEARNED BOY.,Something he found that made his valour shy;
10120,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And thus there seem'd to be a hollow truce,"
10121,THE LEARNED BOY.,Still threat'ning something dismal to produce.
10122,THE LEARNED BOY.,Ere this the Father at his leisure read
10123,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The son's choice volumes, and his wonder fled;"
10124,THE LEARNED BOY.,He saw how wrought the works of either kind
10125,THE LEARNED BOY.,"On so presuming, yet so weak a mind;"
10126,THE LEARNED BOY.,"These in a chosen hour he made his prey,"
10127,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Condemn'd, and bore with vengeful thoughts away;"
10128,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Then in a close recess the couple near,"
10129,THE LEARNED BOY.,"He sat unseen to see, unheard to hear."
10130,THE LEARNED BOY.,There soon a trial for his patience came;
10131,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Beneath were placed the Youth and ancient Dame,"
10132,THE LEARNED BOY.,Each on a purpose fix'd--but neither thought
10133,THE LEARNED BOY.,"How near a foe, with power and vengeance fraught."
10134,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And now the matron told, as tidings sad,"
10135,THE LEARNED BOY.,What she had heard of her beloved lad;
10136,THE LEARNED BOY.,"How he to graceless, wicked men gave heed,"
10137,THE LEARNED BOY.,And wicked books would night and morning read;
10138,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Some former lectures she again began,"
10139,THE LEARNED BOY.,And begg'd attention of her little man;
10140,THE LEARNED BOY.,"She brought, with many a pious boast, in view"
10141,THE LEARNED BOY.,"His former studies, and condemn'd the new:"
10142,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Once he the names of saints and patriarchs old,"
10143,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Judges and kings, and chiefs and prophets, told;"
10144,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Then he in winter-nights the Bible took,"
10145,THE LEARNED BOY.,To count how often in the sacred book
10146,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The sacred name appear'd, and could rehearse"
10147,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Which were the middle chapter, word, and verse,"
10148,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The very letter in the middle placed,"
10149,THE LEARNED BOY.,And so employ'd the hours that others waste.
10150,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Such wert thou once; and now, my child, they say"
10151,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Thy faith like water runneth fast away,"
10152,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The prince of devils hath, I fear, beguiled"
10153,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The ready wit of my backsliding child."""
10154,THE LEARNED BOY.,"On this, with lofty looks, our Clerk began"
10155,THE LEARNED BOY.,"His grave rebuke, as he assumed the man. -"
10156,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""There is no devil,"" said the hopeful youth,"
10157,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Nor prince of devils:  that I know for truth."
10158,THE LEARNED BOY.,Have I not told you how my books describe
10159,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The arts of priests, and all the canting tribe?"
10160,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Your Bible mentions Egypt, where it seems"
10161,THE LEARNED BOY.,Was Joseph found when Pharoah dream'd his dreams:
10162,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Now in that place, in some bewilder'd head,"
10163,THE LEARNED BOY.,(The learned write) religious dreams were bred;
10164,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Whence through the earth, with various forms combined,"
10165,THE LEARNED BOY.,"They came to frighten and afflict mankind,"
10166,THE LEARNED BOY.,Prone (so I read) to let a priest invade
10167,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Their souls with awe, and by his craft be made"
10168,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Slave to his will, and profit to his trade:"
10169,THE LEARNED BOY.,"So say my books, and how the rogues agreed"
10170,THE LEARNED BOY.,"To blind the victims, to defraud and lead;"
10171,THE LEARNED BOY.,"When joys above to ready dupes were sold,"
10172,THE LEARNED BOY.,And hell was threaten'd to the shy and cold.
10173,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Why so amazed, and so prepared to pray?"
10174,THE LEARNED BOY.,As if a Being heard a word we say:
10175,THE LEARNED BOY.,This may surprise you; I myself began
10176,THE LEARNED BOY.,"To feel disturb'd, and to my Bible ran:"
10177,THE LEARNED BOY.,"I now am wiser--yet agree in this,"
10178,THE LEARNED BOY.,The book has things that are not much amiss;
10179,THE LEARNED BOY.,"It is a fine old work, and I protest"
10180,THE LEARNED BOY.,I hate to hear it treated as a jest:
10181,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The book has wisdom in it, if you look"
10182,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Wisely upon it as another book."""
10183,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Oh! wicked! wicked! my unhappy child,"
10184,THE LEARNED BOY.,"How hast thou been by evil men beguiled!"""
10185,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""How! wicked, say you?  You can little guess"
10186,THE LEARNED BOY.,The gain of that which you call wickedness;
10187,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Why, sins you think it sinful but to name"
10188,THE LEARNED BOY.,Have gain'd both wives and widows wealth and fame;
10189,THE LEARNED BOY.,And this because such people never dread
10190,THE LEARNED BOY.,Those threaten'd pains; hell comes not in their head:
10191,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Love is our nature, wealth we all desire,"
10192,THE LEARNED BOY.,And what we wish 'tis lawful to acquire;
10193,THE LEARNED BOY.,So say my books--and what beside they show
10194,THE LEARNED BOY.,'Tis time to let this honest Farmer know.
10195,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Nay, look not grave:  am I commanded down"
10196,THE LEARNED BOY.,To feed his cattle and become his clown?
10197,THE LEARNED BOY.,Is such his purpose?  Then he shall be told
10198,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The vulgar insult--Hold, in mercy hold! -"
10199,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Father, oh! father! throw the whip away;"
10200,THE LEARNED BOY.,I was but jesting; on my knees I pray -
10201,THE LEARNED BOY.,"There, hold his arm--oh! leave us not alone:"
10202,THE LEARNED BOY.,"In pity cease, and I will yet atone"
10203,THE LEARNED BOY.,"For all my sin""--In vain; stroke after stroke,"
10204,THE LEARNED BOY.,"On side and shoulder, quick as mill-wheels broke;"
10205,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Quick as the patient's pulse, who trembling cried,"
10206,THE LEARNED BOY.,And still the parent with a stroke replied;
10207,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Till all the medicine he prepared was dealt,"
10208,THE LEARNED BOY.,And every bone the precious influence felt;
10209,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Till all the panting flesh was red and raw,"
10210,THE LEARNED BOY.,And every thought was turn'd to fear and awe;
10211,THE LEARNED BOY.,Till every doubt to due respect gave place. -
10212,THE LEARNED BOY.,Such cures are done when doctors know the case.
10213,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Oh! I shall die--my father! do receive"
10214,THE LEARNED BOY.,My dying words; indeed I do believe.
10215,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The books are lying books, I know it well;"
10216,THE LEARNED BOY.,"There is a devil, oh! there is a hell;"
10217,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And I'm a sinner:  spare me, I am young,"
10218,THE LEARNED BOY.,My sinful words were only on my tongue;
10219,THE LEARNED BOY.,My heart consented not; 'tis all a lie:
10220,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Oh! spare me then, I'm not prepared to die."""
10221,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Vain, worthless, stupid wretch!"" the Father cried;"
10222,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Dost thou presume to teach? art thou a guide?"
10223,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Driveller and dog, it gives the mind distress"
10224,THE LEARNED BOY.,To hear thy thoughts in their religious dress;
10225,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Thy pious folly moved my strong disdain,"
10226,THE LEARNED BOY.,Yet I forgave thee for thy want of brain;
10227,THE LEARNED BOY.,But Job in patience must the man exceed
10228,THE LEARNED BOY.,Who could endure thee in thy present creed.
10229,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Is it for thee, thou idiot, to pretend"
10230,THE LEARNED BOY.,The wicked cause a helping hand to lend?
10231,THE LEARNED BOY.,Canst thou a judge in any question be?
10232,THE LEARNED BOY.,Atheists themselves would scorn a friend like thee.
10233,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Lo! yonder blaze thy worthies; in one heap"
10234,THE LEARNED BOY.,Thy scoundrel favourites must for ever sleep:
10235,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Each yields its poison to the flame in turn,"
10236,THE LEARNED BOY.,Where whores and infidels are doomed to burn;
10237,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Two noble faggots made the flame you see,"
10238,THE LEARNED BOY.,Reserving only two fair twigs for thee;
10239,THE LEARNED BOY.,"That in thy view the instruments may stand,"
10240,THE LEARNED BOY.,And be in future ready for my hand:
10241,THE LEARNED BOY.,"The just mementos that, though silent, show"
10242,THE LEARNED BOY.,Whence thy correction and improvements flow;
10243,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Beholding these, thou wilt confess their power,"
10244,THE LEARNED BOY.,And feel the shame of this important hour.
10245,THE LEARNED BOY.,"""Hadst thou been humble, I had first design'd"
10246,THE LEARNED BOY.,By care from folly to have freed thy mind;
10247,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And when a clean foundation had been laid,"
10248,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Our priest, more able, would have lent his aid:"
10249,THE LEARNED BOY.,"But thou art weak, and force must folly guide;"
10250,THE LEARNED BOY.,"And thou art vain, and pain must humble pride:"
10251,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Teachers men honour, learners they allure;"
10252,THE LEARNED BOY.,"But learners teaching, of contempt are sure;"
10253,THE LEARNED BOY.,"Scorn is their certain meed, and smart their only cure!"""
