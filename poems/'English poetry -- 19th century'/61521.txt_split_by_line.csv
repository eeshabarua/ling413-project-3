60,I.,I.
61,I.,
62,I.,"The _Daily Menace_, I presume?"
63,I.,Forgive the litter in the room.
64,I.,I can’t explain to you
65,I.,How out of place a man like me
66,I.,"Would be without the things you see,--"
67,I.,The Shields and Assegais and odds
68,I.,And ends of little savage gods.
69,I.,Be seated; take a pew.
70,I.,"(Excuse the phrase. I’m rather rough,"
71,I.,And--pardon me!--but have you got
72,I.,A pencil? I’ve another here:
73,I.,"The one that you have brought, I fear,"
74,I.,Will not be long enough.)
75,I.,
76,I.,"[Illustration ** A journalist taking notes from our traveller,"
77,I.,who is talking.]
78,I.,
79,I.,And so the Public want to hear
80,I.,About the expedition
81,I.,From which I recently returned:
82,I.,Of how the Fetish Tree was burned;
83,I.,"Of how we struggled to the coast,"
84,I.,And lost our ammunition;
85,I.,"How we retreated, side by side;"
86,I.,"And how, like Englishmen, we died."
87,I.,"Well, as you know, I hate to boast,"
88,I.,"And, what is more, I can’t abide"
89,I.,A popular position.
90,I.,I told the Duke the other day
91,I.,The way I felt about it.
92,I.,He answered courteously--“Oh!”
93,I.,An Editor (who had an air
94,I.,Of what the Dutch call _savoir faire_)
95,I.,"Said, “Mr. Rooter, you are right,"
96,I.,And nobody can doubt it.”
97,I.,"The Duchess murmured, “Very true.”"
98,I.,"Her comments may be brief and few,"
99,I.,But very seldom trite.
100,I.,"Still, representing as you do"
101,I.,"A public and a point of view,"
102,I.,I’ll give you leave to jot
103,I.,"A few remarks,--a very few,--"
104,I.,But understand that this is not
105,I.,A formal interview.
106,I.,"And, first of all, I will begin"
107,I.,By talking of Commander Sin.
108,I.,
109,I.,[Illustration ** Our traveller and the Duke in evening dress

111,I.,

115,I.,
116,II.,II.
117,II.,
118,II.,
119,II.,"Poor Henry Sin from quite a child,"
120,II.,"I fear, was always rather wild;"
121,II.,But all his faults were due
122,II.,"To something free and unrestrained,"
123,II.,That partly pleased and partly pained
124,II.,The people whom he knew.
125,II.,"Untaught (for what our times require),"
126,II.,"Lazy, and something of a liar,"
127,II.,He had a foolish way
128,II.,Of always swearing (more or less);
129,II.,"And, lastly, let us say"
130,II.,"A little slovenly in dress,"
131,II.,A trifle prone to drunkenness;
132,II.,"A gambler also to excess,"
133,II.,And never known to pay.
134,II.,"As for his clubs in London, he"
135,II.,"Was pilled at ten, expelled from three."
136,II.,A man Bohemian as could be--
137,II.,"But really vicious? Oh, no!"
138,II.,"When these are mentioned, all is said."
139,II.,And then--Commander Sin is dead:
140,II.,_De Mortuis cui bono?_
141,II.,
142,II.,[Illustration ** Sin and our traveller playing cards and gambling.]
143,II.,
144,II.,"Of course, the Public know I mean"
145,II.,To publish in the winter.
146,II.,I mention the intention in
147,II.,Connection with Commander Sin;
148,II.,The book is with the Printer.
149,II.,"And here, among the proofs, I find"
150,II.,The very thing I had in mind--
151,II.,The portrait upon page thirteen.
152,II.,
153,II.,[Illustration ** Portrait of Sin in a slightly tattered military
154,II.,dress uniform.]
155,II.,
156,II.,"Pray pause awhile, and mark"
157,II.,"The wiry limbs, the vigorous mien,"
158,II.,The tangled hair and dark;
159,II.,"The glance imperative and hot,"
160,II.,That takes a world by storm:
161,II.,"All these are in the plate, but what"
162,II.,You chiefly should observe is
163,II.,The--Did you say his uniform
164,II.,Betrayed a foreign service?
165,II.,
166,II.,"Of course, it does! He was not born"
167,II.,In little England! No!
168,II.,"Beyond the Cape, beyond the Horn,"
169,II.,"Beyond Fernando Po,"
170,II.,In some far Isle he saw the light
171,II.,"That burns the torrid zone,"
172,II.,But where it lay was never quite
173,II.,Indubitably known.
174,II.,"Himself inclined to Martinique,"
175,II.,His friends to Farralone.
176,II.,But why of this discussion speak?
177,II.,The Globe was all his own!
178,II.,Oh! surely upon such a birth
179,II.,No petty flag unfurled!
180,II.,"He was a citizen of earth,"
181,II.,A subject of the world!
182,II.,
183,II.,"As for the uniform he bore,"
184,II.,He won it in the recent war
185,II.,"Between Peru and Ecuador,"
186,II.,And thoroughly he earned it.
187,II.,Alone of all who at the time
188,II.,"Were serving sentences for crime,"
189,II.,"Sin, during his incarceration"
190,II.,Had studied works on navigation;
191,II.,"And when the people learned it,"
192,II.,"They promptly let him out of jail,"
193,II.,But on condition he should sail.
194,II.,
195,II.,[Illustration ** Prisoner Sin with ball and chain speaking with
196,II.,three military gentlemen.]
197,II.,
198,II.,"It marked an epoch, and you may"
199,II.,Recall the action in
200,II.,A place called Quaxipotle bay?
201,II.,"Yes, both the navies ran away;"
202,II.,"And yet, if Ecuador can say"
203,II.,"That on the whole she won the day,"
204,II.,The fact is due to Sin.
205,II.,
206,II.,[Illustration ** Two men in rain gear at the wheel of a ship.]
207,II.,
208,II.,"The Fleet was hardly ten weeks out,"
209,II.,When somebody descried
210,II.,"The enemy. Sin gave a shout,"
211,II.,The Helmsmen put the ship about;
212,II.,"For, upon either side,"
213,II.,Tactics demanded a retreat.
214,II.,"Due west retired the foreign fleet,"
215,II.,But Sin he steered due east;
216,II.,"He muttered, “They shall never meet.”"
217,II.,"And when, towards the close of day,"
218,II.,The foemen were at least
219,II.,"Fifteen or twenty miles away,"
220,II.,"He called his cabin-steward aft,"
221,II.,The boldest of his men;
222,II.,He grasped them by the hand; he laughed
223,II.,"A fearless laugh, and then,"
224,II.,"“Heaven help the right! Full steam a-head,"
225,II.,"Fighting for fighting’s sake,” he said."
226,II.,
227,II.,[Illustration ** Sailors firing a cannon.]
228,II.,
229,II.,Due west the foe--due east he steered.
230,II.,"Ah, me! the very stokers cheered,"
231,II.,And faces black with coal
232,II.,And fuzzy with a five days’ beard
233,II.,"Popped up, and yelled, and disappeared"
234,II.,Each in its little hole.
235,II.,"Long after they were out of sight,"
236,II.,"Long after dark, throughout the night,"
237,II.,"Throughout the following day,"
238,II.,He went on fighting all the time!
239,II.,"Not war, perhaps, but how sublime!"
240,II.,
241,II.,[Illustration ** Sin in military uniform greeting a fellow officer
242,II.,boarding a ship.]
243,II.,
244,II.,"Just as he would have stepped ashore,"
245,II.,The President of Ecuador
246,II.,Came on his quarter deck;
247,II.,"Embraced him twenty times or more,"
248,II.,"And gave him stripes and things galore,"
249,II.,"Crosses and medals by the score,"
250,II.,"And handed him a cheque,--"
251,II.,And then a little speech he read.
252,II.,
253,II.,"“Of twenty years, your sentence said,"
254,II.,“That you should serve--another week
255,II.,“(Alas! it shames me as I speak)
256,II.,“Was owing when you quitted.
257,II.,"“In recognition of your nerve,"
258,II.,“It gives me pleasure to observe
259,II.,“The time you still had got to serve
260,II.,“Is totally remitted.
261,II.,
262,II.,[Illustration ** Portrait of five men in military uniforms.]
263,II.,
264,II.,“Instead of which these friends of mine”--
265,II.,(And here he pointed to a line
266,II.,Of Colonels on the Quay)--
267,II.,“Have changed your sentence to a fine
268,II.,“Made payable to me.
269,II.,“No--do not thank me--not a word!
270,II.,“I am very glad to say
271,II.,“This little cheque is quite a third
272,II.,“Of what you have to pay.”
273,II.,
274,II.,"The crew they cheered and cheered again,"
275,II.,The simple-loyal-hearted men!
276,II.,
277,II.,Such deeds could never fail to be
278,II.,Renowned throughout the west.
279,II.,It was our cousins over sea
280,II.,"That loved the Sailor best,--"
281,II.,"Our Anglo-Saxon kith and kin,"
282,II.,"They doted on Commander Sin,"
283,II.,And gave him a tremendous feast
284,II.,The week before we started.
285,II.,"O’Hooligan, and Vonderbeast,"
286,II.,"And Nicolazzi, and the rest,"
287,II.,Were simply broken-hearted.
288,II.,
289,II.,"They came and ate and cried, “God speed!”"
290,II.,"The Bill was very large indeed,"
291,II.,And paid for by an Anglo-Saxon
292,II.,Who bore the sterling name of Jackson.
293,II.,On this occasion Sin was seen
294,II.,Toasting McKinley and the Queen.
295,II.,"The speech was dull, but not an eye,"
296,II.,Not even the champagne was dry.
297,II.,

312,III.,
313,III.,
314,III.,"[Illustration ** Blood and another man at a dining table,"
315,III.,discussing a prospectus.]
316,III.,
317,III.,"Now William Blood, or, as I still"
318,III.,"Affectionately call him, Bill,"
319,III.,Was of a different stamp;
320,III.,"One who, in other ages born"
321,III.,Had turned to strengthen and adorn
322,III.,The Senate or the Camp.
323,III.,"But Fortune, jealous and austere,"
324,III.,Had marked him for a great career
325,III.,Of more congenial kind--
326,III.,"A sort of modern Buccaneer,"
327,III.,Commercial and refined.
328,III.,"Like all great men, his chief affairs"
329,III.,Were buying stocks and selling shares.
330,III.,He occupied his mind
331,III.,In buying them by day from men
332,III.,"Who needed ready cash, and then"
333,III.,At evening selling them again
334,III.,To those with whom he dined.
335,III.,
336,III.,But such a task could never fill
337,III.,His masterful ambition
338,III.,"That rapid glance, that iron will,"
339,III.,Disdained (and rightfully) to make
340,III.,"A profit here and there, or take"
341,III.,His two per cent. commission.
342,III.,His soul with nobler stuff was fraught;
343,III.,"The love of country, as it ought,"
344,III.,Haunted his every act and thought.
345,III.,"To that he lent his mighty powers,"
346,III.,"To that he gave his waking hours,"
347,III.,"Of that he dreamed in troubled sleep,"
348,III.,"Till, after many years, the deep"
349,III.,"Imperial emotion,"
350,III.,"That moves us like a martial strain,"
351,III.,Turned his Napoleonic brain
352,III.,To company promotion.
353,III.,
354,III.,[Illustration ** Blood in a checkered suit waving a walking stick
355,III.,at our traveller who is relaxing and smoking in a chair.]
356,III.,
357,III.,"He failed, and it was better so:"
358,III.,It made our expedition.
359,III.,One day (it was a year ago)
360,III.,"He came on foot across the town,"
361,III.,"And said his luck was rather down,"
362,III.,And would I lend him half-a-crown?
363,III.,"I did, but on condition"
364,III.,"(Drawn up in proper legal shape,"
365,III.,"Witnessed and sealed, and tied with tape,"
366,III.,"And costing two pound two),"
367,III.,"That, “If within the current year"
368,III.,"He made a hundred thousand clear,”"
369,III.,He should accompany me in
370,III.,A Project I had formed with Sin
371,III.,To go to Timbuctoo.
372,III.,"Later, we had a tiff because"
373,III.,"I introduced another clause,"
374,III.,"Of which the general sense is,"
375,III.,"That Blood, in the unlikely case"
376,III.,"Of this adventure taking place,"
377,III.,Should pay the whole expenses.
378,III.,Blood swore that he had never read
379,III.,Or seen the clause. But Blood is dead.
380,III.,
381,III.,"Well, through a curious stroke of luck,"
382,III.,That very afternoon he struck
383,III.,"A new concern, in which,"
384,III.,"By industry and honest ways,"
385,III.,He grew (to his eternal praise!)
386,III.,In something less than sixty days
387,III.,Inordinately rich.
388,III.,
389,III.,Let me describe what he became
390,III.,"The day that he succeeded,--"
391,III.,"Though, in the searching light that Fame"
392,III.,"Has cast on that immortal name,"
393,III.,The task is hardly needed.
394,III.,
395,III.,The world has very rarely seen
396,III.,A deeper gulf than stood between
397,III.,The men who were my friends.
398,III.,"And, speaking frankly, I confess"
399,III.,"They never cared to meet, unless"
400,III.,It served their private ends.
401,III.,
402,III.,"Sin loved the bottle, William gold;"
403,III.,"’Twas Blood that bought and Sin that sold,"
404,III.,In all their mutual dealings.
405,III.,Blood never broke the penal laws;
406,III.,"Sin did it all the while, because"
407,III.,He had the finer feelings.
408,III.,
409,III.,"Blood had his dreams, but Sin was mad:"
410,III.,"While Sin was foolish, Blood was bad,"
411,III.,"Sin, though I say it, was a cad."
412,III.,(And if the word arouses
413,III.,"Some criticism, pray reflect"
414,III.,"How twisted was his intellect,"
415,III.,And what a past he had!)
416,III.,"But Blood was exquisitely bred,"
417,III.,"And always in the swim,"
418,III.,And people were extremely glad
419,III.,To ask him to their houses.
420,III.,Be not too eager to condemn:
421,III.,"It was not he that hunted them,"
422,III.,But they that hunted him.
423,III.,
424,III.,In this fair world of culture made
425,III.,"For men of his peculiar trade,"
426,III.,"Of all the many parts he played,"
427,III.,The part he grew to like the best
428,III.,Was called “the self-respecting guest.”
429,III.,And for that very reason
430,III.,He found himself in great request
431,III.,"At parties in the season,"
432,III.,"Wherever gentlemen invest,"
433,III.,From Chelsea to Mayfair.
434,III.,"From Lath and Stucco Gate, S.W.,"
435,III.,"To 90, Berkeley Square."
436,III.,"The little statesmen in the bud,"
437,III.,"The big provincial mayor,"
438,III.,"The man that owns a magazine,"
439,III.,The authoress who might have been;
440,III.,"They always sent a card to Blood,"
441,III.,And Blood was always there.
442,III.,"At every dinner, crush or rout,"
443,III.,A little whirlpool turned about
444,III.,"The form immoveable and stout,"
445,III.,That marked the Millionaire.
446,III.,
447,III.,"[Illustration ** Men in evening dress (tailcoats), with Blood, who"
448,III.,"is quite stout, in the center.]"
449,III.,
450,III.,Sin (you remember) could not stay
451,III.,"In any club for half a day,"
452,III.,When once his name was listed;
453,III.,"But Blood belonged to ninety-four,"
454,III.,And would have joined as many more
455,III.,Had any more existed.
456,III.,Sin at a single game would lose
457,III.,"A little host of I.O.U.’s,"
458,III.,And often took the oath absurd
459,III.,To break the punters or his word
460,III.,Before it was completed.
461,III.,Blood was another pair of shoes:
462,III.,"A man of iron, cold and hard,"
463,III.,"He very rarely touched a card,"
464,III.,But when he did he cheated.[2]
465,III.,
466,III.,[2]
467,III.,
468,III.,"These gentlemen are bulls and bears,"
469,III.,Their club has very curious chairs.
470,III.,
471,III.,
472,III.,[Illustration ** Four men sitting at a table playing cards. One is
473,III.,Blood and he appears to be cheating.]
474,III.,
475,III.,"Again the origin of Sin,"
476,III.,Was doubtful and obscure;
477,III.,"Whereas, the Captain’s origin"
478,III.,Was absolutely sure.
479,III.,
480,III.,A document affirms that he
481,III.,Was born in 1853
482,III.,"Upon a German ship at sea,"
483,III.,Just off the Grand Canary.
484,III.,And though the log is rather free
485,III.,"And written too compactly,"
486,III.,"We know the weather to a T,"
487,III.,"The longitude to a degree,"
488,III.,"The latitude exactly,"
489,III.,And every detail is the same;
490,III.,We even know his Mother’s name.
491,III.,"As to his father’s occupation,"
492,III.,"Creed, colour, character or nation,"
493,III.,(On which the rumours vary);
494,III.,"He said himself concerning it,"
495,III.,"With admirably caustic wit,"
496,III.,“I think the Public would much rather
497,III.,Be sure of me than of my father.”
498,III.,
499,III.,The contrast curiously keen
500,III.,Their characters could yield
501,III.,Was most conspicuously seen
502,III.,Upon the Tented Field.
503,III.,Was there by chance a native tribe
504,III.,"To cheat, cajole, corrupt, or bribe?--"
505,III.,In such conditions Sin would burn
506,III.,"To plunge into the fray,"
507,III.,While Blood would run the whole concern
508,III.,From fifty miles away.
509,III.,
510,III.,"He had, wherever honours vain"
511,III.,Were weighed against material gain
512,III.,"A judgment, practical and sane,"
513,III.,Peculiarly his own.
514,III.,In this connection let me quote
515,III.,An interesting anecdote
516,III.,Not generally known.
517,III.,Before he sailed he might have been
518,III.,(If he had thought it paid him)
519,III.,A military man of note.
520,III.,Her gracious Majesty the Queen
521,III.,"Would certainly have made him,"
522,III.,"In spite of his advancing years,"
523,III.,A Captain of the Volunteers.
524,III.,
525,III.,[Illustration ** Blood and another man standing and talking.]
526,III.,
527,III.,A certain Person of the Sort
528,III.,"That has great influence at Court,"
529,III.,Assured him it was so;
530,III.,"And said, “It simply lies with you"
531,III.,To get this little matter through.
532,III.,You pay a set of trifling fees
533,III.,To me--at any time you please----”
534,III.,Blood stopped him with a “No!”
535,III.,“This signal favour of the Queen’s
536,III.,Is very burdensome. It means
537,III.,"A smart Review (for all I know),"
538,III.,In which I am supposed to show
539,III.,Strategical ability:
540,III.,And after that tremendous fights
541,III.,"And sleeping out on rainy nights,"
542,III.,And much responsibility.
543,III.,"Thank you: I have my own position,"
544,III.,"I need no parchment or commission,"
545,III.,And everyone who knows my name
546,III.,Will call me ‘Captain’ just the same.”
547,III.,There was our leader in a phrase:
548,III.,"A man of strong decisive ways,"
549,III.,But reticent[3] and grim.
550,III.,"Though not an Englishman, I own,"
551,III.,Perhaps it never will be known
552,III.,What England lost in him!
553,III.,
554,III.,
555,III.,[3]
556,III.,
557,III.,"This reticence, which some have called hypocrisy"
558,III.,Was but the sign of nature’s aristocracy.

567,IV.,"The ship was dropping down the stream,"
568,IV.,"The Isle of Dogs was just abeam,"
569,IV.,And Sin and Blood and I
570,IV.,"Saw Greenwich Hospital go past,"
571,IV.,And gave a look--(for them the last)--
572,IV.,Towards the London sky!
573,IV.,Ah! nowhere have I ever seen
574,IV.,A sky so pure and so serene!
575,IV.,
576,IV.,"Did we at length, perhaps, regret"
577,IV.,Our strange adventurous lot?
578,IV.,And were our eyes a trifle wet
579,IV.,"With tears that we repressed, and yet"
580,IV.,Which started blinding hot?
581,IV.,"Perhaps--and yet, I do not know,"
582,IV.,"For when we came to go below,"
583,IV.,We cheerfully admitted
584,IV.,That though there was a smell of paint
585,IV.,(And though a very just complaint
586,IV.,"Had to be lodged against the food),"
587,IV.,The cabin furniture was good
588,IV.,And comfortably fitted.
589,IV.,And even out beyond the Nore
590,IV.,We did not ask to go ashore.
591,IV.,
592,IV.,[Illustration ** Stout man at dinner refusing asparagus.]
593,IV.,
594,IV.,"To turn to more congenial topics,"
595,IV.,I said a little while ago
596,IV.,The food was very much below
597,IV.,The standard needed to prepare
598,IV.,Explorers for the special fare
599,IV.,Which all authorities declare
600,IV.,Is needful in the tropics.
601,IV.,A Frenchman sitting next to us
602,IV.,Rejected the asparagus;
603,IV.,"The turtle soup was often cold,"
604,IV.,"The ices hot, the omelettes old,"
605,IV.,The coffee worse than I can tell;
606,IV.,And Sin (who had a happy knack
607,IV.,Of rhyming rapidly and well
608,IV.,Like Cyrano de Bergerac)
609,IV.,"Said “Quant à moi, je n’aime pas"
610,IV.,Du tout ce pâté de foie gras!”
611,IV.,But this fastidious taste
612,IV.,Succeeded in a startling way;
613,IV.,At Dinner on the following day
614,IV.,They gave us Bloater Paste.
615,IV.,Well--hearty Pioneers and rough
616,IV.,Should not be over nice;
617,IV.,"I think these lines are quite enough,"
618,IV.,And hope they will suffice
619,IV.,To make the Caterers observe
620,IV.,The kind of Person whom they serve.----

628,IV.,About the Company’s Champagne!
629,IV.,This most expensive kind of wine
630,IV.,In England is a matter
631,IV.,Of pride or habit when we dine
632,IV.,(Presumably the latter).
633,IV.,Beneath an equatorial sky
634,IV.,You _must_ consume it or you die;
635,IV.,And stern indomitable men
636,IV.,"Have told me, time and time again,"
637,IV.,“The nuisance of the tropics is
638,IV.,The sheer necessity of fizz.”
639,IV.,Consider then the carelessness--
640,IV.,"The lack of polish and address,"
641,IV.,"The villainy in short,"
642,IV.,Of serving what explorers think
643,IV.,To be a necessary drink
644,IV.,In bottles holding something less
645,IV.,"Than one Imperial quart,"
646,IV.,And costing quite a shilling more
647,IV.,Than many grocers charge ashore.

655,IV.,Grew higher and more fiery.

657,IV.,"We lay and drank, and swore, and played"
658,IV.,At Trick-my-neighbour in the shade;

660,IV.,"However trivial or slight,"
661,IV.,Was noted in my diary.
662,IV.,I have it here--the usual things--
663,IV.,A serpent (not the sort with wings)
664,IV.,Came rising from the sea:
665,IV.,In length (as far as we could guess)
666,IV.,A quarter of a mile or less.
667,IV.,The weather was extremely clear
668,IV.,The creature dangerously near
669,IV.,And plain as it would be.

671,IV.,[Illustration ** Our traveller on the foredeck of the ship viewing

677,IV.,"Just north, I find, of Cape de Verd"
678,IV.,We caught a very curious bird
679,IV.,With horns upon its head;
680,IV.,"And--not, as one might well suppose,"
681,IV.,Web-footed or with jointed toes--
682,IV.,But having hoofs instead.

815,VI.,How great a Power for Social Good

818,VI.,“You are not what your fathers were;

866,VI.,Surely our simple duty here

870,VI.,And from a higher point of view
871,VI.,To give the full direction due

934,VII.,Brackish and pestilent with weeds
935,VII.,"And absolutely useless reeds,"
936,VII.,It lay; but nothing daunted
937,VII.,At seeing how it heaved and steamed

957,VII.,Whom we had loved so long.
958,VII.,"He looked affectionately sly,"

961,VII.,"You only see a swamp, but I----"
962,VII.,"My friends, I will explain it."
963,VII.,I know some gentlemen in town

965,VII.,Merely for leave to drain it.”
966,VII.,
967,VII.,A little later on we found
968,VII.,A piece of gently rolling ground
969,VII.,That showed above the flat.
970,VII.,Such a protuberance or rise
971,VII.,As wearies European eyes.
972,VII.,"To common men, like Sin and me"

983,VII.,In his prospectus Captain Blood
984,VII.,Baptized it “Eldorado.”

997,VIII.,The kind of thing that (by the way)
998,VIII.,Men in our cold agnostic day
999,VIII.,"Must come from Africa to say,"
1000,VIII.,From England to believe.
1001,VIII.,
1002,VIII.,"Blood had, while yet we were in town,"
1003,VIII.,Said with his intellectual frown:
1004,VIII.,“Suppose a Rhino knocks you down
1005,VIII.,"And walks upon you like a mat,"
1006,VIII.,"Think of the public irritation,"
1007,VIII.,"If with an incident like that,"
1008,VIII.,We cannot give an illustration.”
1009,VIII.,
1010,VIII.,Seeing we should be at a loss
1011,VIII.,"To reproduce the scene,"
1012,VIII.,"We bought a stuffed rhinocerous,"
1013,VIII.,"A Kodak, and a screen."
1014,VIII.,We fixed a picture. William pressed
1015,VIII.,"A button, and I did the rest."
1016,VIII.,
1017,VIII.,To those Carnivora that make
1018,VIII.,An ordinary Person quake
1019,VIII.,We did not give a care.

1021,VIII.,[Illustration ** Our three travellers easing away from tent as a

1023,VIII.,
1024,VIII.,The Lion never will attack
1025,VIII.,"A White, if he can get a Black."
1026,VIII.,And there were such a lot of these
1027,VIII.,We could afford with perfect ease
1028,VIII.,To spare one here and there.
1029,VIII.,It made us more compact--and then--
1030,VIII.,It’s right to spare one’s fellow men.
1031,VIII.,
1032,VIII.,"Of far more consequence to us,"
1033,VIII.,"And much more worthy to detain us,"
1034,VIII.,The very creature that we feared
1035,VIII.,"(I mean the white Rhinoceros,"
1036,VIII.,“_Siste Viator Africanus_”)
1037,VIII.,In all its majesty appeared.
1038,VIII.,
1039,VIII.,"This large, but peevish pachyderm"
1040,VIII.,"(To use a scientific term),"
1041,VIII.,"Though commonly herbivorous,"
1042,VIII.,Is eminently dangerous.
1043,VIII.,It may be just the creature’s play;
1044,VIII.,But people who have felt it say
1045,VIII.,That when he prods you with his horn

1055,VIII.,But flight is not for me![5]
1056,VIII.,"Blood happened to be standing by,"
1057,VIII.,He darted up a tree

1059,VIII.,And fix him with the Human Eye.”
1060,VIII.,
1061,VIII.,[5]
1062,VIII.,
1063,VIII.,"Besides, I found my foot was caught"

1066,VIII.,
1067,VIII.,Between a person and a beast
1068,VIII.,(But for the Human Eye at least)
1069,VIII.,The issue must be clear.
1070,VIII.,"The tension on my nerves increased,"
1071,VIII.,And yet I felt no fear.
1072,VIII.,"Nay, do not praise me--not at all--"
1073,VIII.,"Courage is merely physical,"
1074,VIII.,And several people I could name
1075,VIII.,Would probably have done the same.

1077,VIII.,"I kept my glance extremely firm,"
1078,VIII.,I saw the wretched creature squirm;
1079,VIII.,A look of terror over-spread
1080,VIII.,"Its features, and it dropped down dead."
1081,VIII.,"At least, I thought it did,"
1082,VIII.,"And foolishly withdrew my gaze,"
1083,VIII.,When (finding it was rid
1084,VIII.,Of those mysterious piercing rays)
1085,VIII.,It came to life again.
1086,VIII.,"It jumped into the air, and came"
1087,VIII.,With all its might upon my frame.
1088,VIII.,
1089,VIII.,(Observe the posture of the hoof.
1090,VIII.,The wire and black support that look
1091,VIII.,So artificial in the proof
1092,VIII.,Will be deleted in the book.)
1093,VIII.,
1094,VIII.,It did it thirty separate times;
1095,VIII.,"When, luckily for all these rhymes,"
1096,VIII.,"Blood shot the brute--that is to say,"
1097,VIII.,"Blood shot, and then it ran away."
1098,VIII.,

1105,VIII.,
1106,IX.,IX.
1107,IX.,
1108,IX.,
1109,IX.,We journeyed on in single file;
1110,IX.,The march proceeded mile on mile
1111,IX.,"Monotonous and lonely,"
1112,IX.,We saw (if I remember right)
1113,IX.,The friendly features of a white
1114,IX.,On two occasions only.
1115,IX.,
1116,IX.,The first was when our expedition
1117,IX.,"Came suddenly on a commission,"
1118,IX.,Appointed to determine
1119,IX.,Whether the thirteenth parallel
1120,IX.,"Ran right across a certain well,"
1121,IX.,Or touched a closely neighbouring tree;
1122,IX.,And whether elephants should be
1123,IX.,"Exterminated all as “game,”"
1124,IX.,"Or, what is not at all the same,"
1125,IX.,Destroyed as common vermin.
1126,IX.,
1127,IX.,To this commission had been sent
1128,IX.,"Great bigwigs from the Continent,"
1129,IX.,And on the English side
1130,IX.,Men of such ancient pedigree
1131,IX.,As filled the soul of Blood with glee;
1132,IX.,He started up and cried:--
1133,IX.,"“I’ll go to them at once, and make"
1134,IX.,These young adventurous spirits take
1135,IX.,A proof of my desire
1136,IX.,To use in this concern of ours
1137,IX.,Their unsuspected business powers.
1138,IX.,The bearers of historic names
1139,IX.,Shall rise to something higher
1140,IX.,"Than haggling over frontier claims,"
1141,IX.,And they shall find their last estate
1142,IX.,Enshrined in my directorate.”
1143,IX.,
1144,IX.,[Illustration ** Blood and a military officer sitting outdoors with
1145,IX.,"a palm tree in the background, and a snake wrapped around"
1146,IX.,the tree.]
1147,IX.,
1148,IX.,"In twenty minutes he returned,"
1149,IX.,"His face with righteous anger burned,"
1150,IX.,"And when we asked him what he’d done,"
1151,IX.,"He answered, “They reject us,"
1152,IX.,"I couldn’t get a single one,"
1153,IX.,To come on the prospectus.
1154,IX.,Their leader (though he was a Lord)
1155,IX.,"Stoutly refused to join the board,"
1156,IX.,And made a silly foreign speech
1157,IX.,Which sounded like No Bless Ableech.
1158,IX.,"I’m used to many kinds of men,"
1159,IX.,"And bore it very well; but, when"
1160,IX.,It came to being twitted
1161,IX.,"On my historic Sporting Shirt,"
1162,IX.,I own I felt a trifle hurt;
1163,IX.,I took my leave and quitted.”
1164,IX.,
1165,IX.,There is another side to this;
1166,IX.,With no desire to prejudice
1167,IX.,"The version of our leader,"
1168,IX.,I think I ought to drop a hint
1169,IX.,"Of what I shall be bound to print,"
1170,IX.,In justice to the reader.
1171,IX.,"I followed, keeping out of sight;"
1172,IX.,And took in this ingenious way
1173,IX.,A sketch that throws a certain light
1174,IX.,On _why_ the master went away.
1175,IX.,"No doubt he felt a trifle hurt,"
1176,IX.,It even may be true to say
1177,IX.,They twitted him upon his shirt.
1178,IX.,But isn’t it a trifle thick
1179,IX.,To talk of twitting with a stick?
1180,IX.,
1181,IX.,[Illustration ** Military officer twitting Blood with a stick and
1182,IX.,kicking him.]
1183,IX.,
1184,IX.,"Well, let it pass. He acted well."
1185,IX.,"This species of official swell,"
1186,IX.,"Especially the peer,"
1187,IX.,Who stoops to a delimitation
1188,IX.,With any European nation
1189,IX.,Is doomed to disappear.
1190,IX.,"Blood said, “They pass into the night.”"
1191,IX.,And men like Blood are always right.
1192,IX.,
1193,IX.,THE SECOND shows the full effect
1194,IX.,Of ministerial neglect;
1195,IX.,"Sin, walking out alone in quest"
1196,IX.,Of Boa-constrictors that infest
1197,IX.,"The Lagos Hinterland,"
1198,IX.,"Got separated from the rest,"
1199,IX.,And ran against a band
1200,IX.,Of native soldiers led by three--
1201,IX.,
1202,IX.,[Illustration ** Portrait of three men in (very different)
1203,IX.,military uniforms.]
1204,IX.,
1205,IX.,"A Frenchman, an official Prussian,"
1206,IX.,And what we took to be a Russian--
1207,IX.,The very coalition
1208,IX.,"Who threaten England’s power at sea,"
1209,IX.,"And, but for men like Blood and me,"
1210,IX.,"Would drive her navies from the sea,"
1211,IX.,And hurl her to perdition.
1212,IX.,But did my comrade think to flee?
1213,IX.,To use his very words--Not he!
1214,IX.,He turned with a contemptuous laugh.
1215,IX.,Observe him in the photograph.
1216,IX.,
1217,IX.,[Illustration ** Sin grinning and walking past the three military
1218,IX.,men (from previous illustration).]
1219,IX.,
1220,IX.,"But still these bureaucrats pursued,"
1221,IX.,Until they reached the Captain’s tent.
1222,IX.,They grew astonishingly rude;
1223,IX.,"The Russian simply insolent,"
1224,IX.,Announcing that he had been sent
1225,IX.,"Upon a holy mission,"
1226,IX.,To call for the disarmament
1227,IX.,Of all our expedition.
1228,IX.,He said “the miseries of war
1229,IX.,Had touched his master to the core”;
1230,IX.,It was extremely vexing
1231,IX.,"To hear him add, “he couldn’t stand"
1232,IX.,This passion for absorbing land;
1233,IX.,He hoped we weren’t annexing.”
1234,IX.,The German asked with some brutality
1235,IX.,To have our names and nationality.
1236,IX.,"I had an inspiration,"
1237,IX.,In words methodical and slow
1238,IX.,I gave him this decisive blow:
1239,IX.,“I haven’t got a nation.”
1240,IX.,"Perhaps the dodge was rather low,"
1241,IX.,And yet I wasn’t wrong to
1242,IX.,Escape the consequences so;
1243,IX.,"For, on my soul, I did not know"
1244,IX.,_What_ nation to belong to.
1245,IX.,
1246,IX.,"The German gave a searching look,"
1247,IX.,And marked me in his little book:--
1248,IX.,“The features are a trifle Dutch--
1249,IX.,Perhaps he is a Fenian;
1250,IX.,"He may be a Maltese, but much"
1251,IX.,More probably Armenian.”
1252,IX.,
1253,IX.,Blood gave us each a trifling sum
1254,IX.,"To say that he was deaf and dumb,"
1255,IX.,And backed the affirmation
1256,IX.,"By gestures so extremely rum,"
1257,IX.,They marked him on the writing pad:
1258,IX.,"“Not only deaf and dumb, but mad.”"
1259,IX.,It saved the situation.
1260,IX.,“If such a man as _that_” (said they)
1261,IX.,"“Is Leader, they can go their way.”"
1262,IX.,

1271,X.,
1272,X.,
1273,X.,"Thus, greatly to our ease of mind,"
1274,X.,Our foreign foes we left behind;
1275,X.,But dangers even greater
1276,X.,Were menacing our path instead.
1277,X.,In every book I ever read
1278,X.,"Of travels on the Equator,"
1279,X.,"A plague, mysterious and dread,"
1280,X.,Imperils the narrator;
1281,X.,"He always very nearly dies,"
1282,X.,"But doesn’t, which is calm and wise."
1283,X.,"Said Sin, the indolent and vague,"
1284,X.,“D’you think that we shall get the plague?”
1285,X.,It followed tragically soon;
1286,X.,"In fording an immense lagoon,"
1287,X.,We let our feet get damp.
1288,X.,"Next morning I began to sneeze,"
1289,X.,"The awful enemy, Disease,"
1290,X.,Had fallen on the camp!
1291,X.,"With Blood the malady would take,"
1292,X.,An allotropic form
1293,X.,"Of intermittent stomach ache,"
1294,X.,While Sin grew over warm;
1295,X.,"Complained of weakness in the knees,"
1296,X.,"An inability to think,"
1297,X.,"A strong desire to dose and drink,"
1298,X.,And lie upon his back.
1299,X.,"For many a long delirious day,"
1300,X.,"Each in his individual way,"
1301,X.,Succumbed to the attack.
1302,X.,

1310,XI.,XI.
1311,XI.,
1312,XI.,
1313,XI.,Our litters lay upon the ground
1314,XI.,With heavy curtains shaded round;
1315,XI.,The Plague had passed away.
1316,XI.,"We could not hear a single sound,"
1317,XI.,And wondered as we lay--
1318,XI.,"“Perhaps the Forest Belt is passed,"
1319,XI.,"And Timbuctoo is reached at last,"
1320,XI.,The while our faithful porters keep
1321,XI.,So still to let their masters sleep.”
1322,XI.,
1323,XI.,Poor Blood and I were far too weak
1324,XI.,"To raise ourselves, or even speak;"
1325,XI.,"We lay, content to languish."
1326,XI.,"When Sin, to make the matter certain,"
1327,XI.,"Put out his head beyond the curtain,"
1328,XI.,And cried in utter anguish:
1329,XI.,"“This is not Timbuctoo at all,"
1330,XI.,But just a native Kraal or Crawl;
1331,XI.,"And, what is more, our Caravan"
1332,XI.,Has all deserted to a man.”
1333,XI.,
1334,XI.,*       *       *       *       *
1335,XI.,
1336,XI.,At evening they returned to bring
1337,XI.,"Us prisoners to their savage king,"
1338,XI.,Who seemed upon the whole
1339,XI.,A man urbane and well inclined;
1340,XI.,"He said, “You shall not be confined,"
1341,XI.,But left upon parole.”
1342,XI.,
1343,XI.,"Blood, when he found us both alone,"
1344,XI.,"Lectured in a pedantic tone,"
1345,XI.,"And yet with quaint perfection,"
1346,XI.,On “Prison Systems I have known.”
1347,XI.,He said in this connection:--
1348,XI.,
1349,XI.,“The primal process is to lug
1350,XI.,A Johnny to the cells--or jug.
1351,XI.,"Dear Henry will not think me rude,"
1352,XI.,If--just in passing--I allude
1353,XI.,To Quod or Penal Servitude.
1354,XI.,"Of every form, Parole I take"
1355,XI.,To be the easiest to break.”
1356,XI.,
1357,XI.,On hearing this we ran
1358,XI.,"To get the guns, and then we laid"
1359,XI.,"An admirable ambuscade,"
1360,XI.,In which to catch our man.
1361,XI.,
1362,XI.,"We hid behind a little knoll,"
1363,XI.,And waited for our prey
1364,XI.,To take his usual morning stroll
1365,XI.,Along the fatal way.
1366,XI.,All unsuspecting and alone
1367,XI.,"He came into the danger zone,"
1368,XI.,The range of which we knew
1369,XI.,"To be one furlong and a third,"
1370,XI.,And then--an incident occurred
1371,XI.,"Which, I will pledge my sacred word,"
1372,XI.,Is absolutely true.
1373,XI.,
1374,XI.,[Illustration ** Our three travellers aiming guns at the African
1375,XI.,king from protected positions.]
1376,XI.,
1377,XI.,"Blood took a very careful aim,"
1378,XI.,And Sin and I did just the same;
1379,XI.,Yet by some strange and potent charm
1380,XI.,The King received no kind of harm!
1381,XI.,"He wore, as it appears,"
1382,XI.,"A little fetish on a thread,"
1383,XI.,"A mumbo-jumbo, painted red,"
1384,XI.,"Gross and repulsive in the head,"
1385,XI.,Especially the ears.
1386,XI.,
1387,XI.,[Illustration ** A little fetish on a thread....]
1388,XI.,
1389,XI.,"Last year I should have laughed at it,"
1390,XI.,But now with reverence I admit
1391,XI.,That nothing in the world is commoner
1392,XI.,Than Andrew Lang’s Occult Phenomena.
1393,XI.,
1394,XI.,"On getting back to England, I"
1395,XI.,Described the matter to the Psy-
1396,XI.,Chological Committee.
1397,XI.,
1398,XI.,Of course they thanked me very much;
1399,XI.,"But said, “We have a thousand such,"
1400,XI.,And it would be a pity
1401,XI.,"To break our standing resolution,"
1402,XI.,And pay for any contribution.”
1403,XI.,
1404,XI.,
1405,XI.,
1406,XI.,
1407,XII.,XII.
1408,XII.,
1409,XII.,
1410,XII.,The King was terribly put out;
1411,XII.,"To hear him call the guard and shout,"
1412,XII.,"And stamp, and curse, and rave"
1413,XII.,Was (as the Missionaries say)
1414,XII.,A lesson in the Godless way
1415,XII.,The heathen will behave.
1416,XII.,"He sent us to a Prison, made"
1417,XII.,"Of pointed stakes in palisade,"
1418,XII.,And there for several hours
1419,XII.,"Our Leader was a mark for bricks,"
1420,XII.,"And eggs and cocoanuts and sticks,"
1421,XII.,And pussy-cats in showers.
1422,XII.,Our former porters seemed to bear
1423,XII.,A grudge against the millionaire.
1424,XII.,
1425,XII.,[Illustration ** Our three travellers tied with their backs to a
1426,XII.,stake in a stockade with human bones on the ground.]
1427,XII.,
1428,XII.,And yet the thing I minded most
1429,XII.,Was not the ceaseless teasing
1430,XII.,"(With which the Captain was engrossed),"
1431,XII.,Nor being fastened to a post
1432,XII.,(Though that was far from pleasing);
1433,XII.,But hearing them remark that they
1434,XII.,“Looked forward to the following day.”
1435,XII.,
1436,XII.,
1437,XII.,
1438,XII.,
1439,XIII.,XIII.
1440,XIII.,
1441,XIII.,
1442,XIII.,"At length, when we were left alone,"
1443,XIII.,"Sin twisted with a hollow groan,"
1444,XIII.,And bade the Master save
1445,XIII.,"His comrades by some bold device,"
1446,XIII.,From the impending grave.
1447,XIII.,
1448,XIII.,"Said Blood: “I never take advice,"
1449,XIII.,But every man has got his price;
1450,XIII.,"We must maintain the open door,"
1451,XIII.,"Yes, even at the cost of war!”"
1452,XIII.,"He shifted his position,"
1453,XIII.,And drafted in a little while
1454,XIII.,A note in diplomatic style
1455,XIII.,Containing a condition.
1456,XIII.,
1457,XIII.,“If them that wishes to be told
1458,XIII.,"As how there is a bag of gold,"
1459,XIII.,And where a party hid it;
1460,XIII.,Mayhap as other parties knows
1461,XIII.,"A thing or two, and there be those"
1462,XIII.,As seen the man wot hid it.”
1463,XIII.,"The Monarch read it through, and wrote"
1464,XIII.,A little sentence most emphatical:
1465,XIII.,“I think the language of the note
1466,XIII.,Is strictly speaking not grammatical.”
1467,XIII.,
1468,XIII.,"[Illustration ** The African king seated with his foot on a skull,"
1469,XIII.,"writing, and another African in attendance, armed.]"
1470,XIII.,
1471,XIII.,"On seeing our acute distress,"
1472,XIII.,The King--I really must confess--
1473,XIII.,Behaved uncommon handsome;
1474,XIII.,He said he would release the three
1475,XIII.,If only Captain Blood and he
1476,XIII.,Could settle on a ransom.
1477,XIII.,And it would clear the situation
1478,XIII.,To hear his private valuation.
1479,XIII.,
1480,XIII.,"“My value,” William Blood began,"
1481,XIII.,“Is ludicrously small.
1482,XIII.,I think I am the vilest man
1483,XIII.,That treads this earthly ball;
1484,XIII.,"My head is weak, my heart is cold,"
1485,XIII.,"I’m ugly, vicious, vulgar, old,"
1486,XIII.,"Unhealthy, short and fat."
1487,XIII.,
1488,XIII.,[Illustration ** Blood and African King standing talking.]
1489,XIII.,
1490,XIII.,"I cannot speak, I cannot work,"
1491,XIII.,"I have the temper of a Turk,"
1492,XIII.,And cowardly at that.
1493,XIII.,"Retaining, with your kind permission,"
1494,XIII.,"The usual five per cent. commission,"
1495,XIII.,I think that I could do the job
1496,XIII.,For seventeen or sixteen bob.”
1497,XIII.,
1498,XIII.,"The King was irritated, frowned,"
1499,XIII.,"And cut him short with, “Goodness Gracious!"
1500,XIII.,Your economics _are_ fallacious!
1501,XIII.,"I quite believe you are a wretch,"
1502,XIII.,But things are worth what they will fetch.
1503,XIII.,"I’ll put your price at something round,"
1504,XIII.,"Say, six-and-thirty thousand pound?”"
1505,XIII.,"But just as Blood began with zest,"
1506,XIII.,"To bargain, argue, and protest,"
1507,XIII.,Commander Sin and I
1508,XIII.,Broke in: “Your Majesty was told
1509,XIII.,About a certain bag of gold;
1510,XIII.,"If you will let us try,"
1511,XIII.,"We’ll find the treasure, for we know"
1512,XIII.,The place to half a yard or so.”
1513,XIII.,
1514,XIII.,Poor William! The suspense and pain
1515,XIII.,Had touched the fibre of his brain;
1516,XIII.,"So far from showing gratitude,"
1517,XIII.,He cried in his delirium: “Oh!
1518,XIII.,For Heaven’s sake don’t let them go.”
1519,XIII.,Only a lunatic would take
1520,XIII.,"So singular an attitude,"
1521,XIII.,When loyal comrades for his sake
1522,XIII.,Had put their very lives at stake.
1523,XIII.,
1524,XIII.,*       *       *       *       *
1525,XIII.,
1526,XIII.,The King was perfectly content
1527,XIII.,To let us find it;--and we went.
1528,XIII.,"But as we left we heard him say,"
1529,XIII.,“If there is half an hour’s delay
1530,XIII.,The Captain will have passed away.”

1537,XIV.,
1538,XIV.,Alas! within a single week
1539,XIV.,The Messengers despatched to seek
1540,XIV.,"Our hiding-place had found us,"
1541,XIV.,We made an excellent defence
1542,XIV.,"(I use the word in legal sense),"
1543,XIV.,But none the less they bound us.
1544,XIV.,(Not in the legal sense at all
1545,XIV.,But with a heavy chain and ball).
1546,XIV.,
1547,XIV.,[Illustration ** An African showing Blood’s shirt to the other two
1548,XIV.,travellers.]
1549,XIV.,
1550,XIV.,With barbarism past belief
1551,XIV.,They flaunted in our faces
1552,XIV.,The relics of our noble chief;
1553,XIV.,"With insolent grimaces,"
1554,XIV.,Raised the historic shirt before
1555,XIV.,"Our eyes, and pointed on the floor"
1556,XIV.,To dog-eared cards and loaded dice;
1557,XIV.,It seems they sold him by the slice.
1558,XIV.,"Well, every man has got his price."
1559,XIV.,
1560,XIV.,"The horrors followed thick and fast,"
1561,XIV.,I turned my head to give a last
1562,XIV.,"Farewell to Sin; but, ah! too late,"
1563,XIV.,I only saw his horrid fate--
1564,XIV.,Some savages around a pot
1565,XIV.,That seemed uncomfortably hot;
1566,XIV.,And in the centre of the group
1567,XIV.,My dear companion making soup.
1568,XIV.,
1569,XIV.,[Illustration ** Cooking cauldron in the midst of a group of

1575,XIV.,
1576,XIV.,Then I was pleased to recognize
1577,XIV.,"Two thumbscrews suited to my size,"
1578,XIV.,And I was very glad to see
1579,XIV.,That they were going to torture me.
1580,XIV.,"I find the torture pays me best,"
1581,XIV.,It simply teems with interest.
1582,XIV.,
1583,XIV.,They hung me up above the floor
1584,XIV.,Head downwards by a rope;
1585,XIV.,"They thrashed me half an hour or more,"
1586,XIV.,They filled my mouth with soap;
1587,XIV.,They jobbed me with a pointed pole
1588,XIV.,"To make me lose my self-control,"
1589,XIV.,But they did not succeed.
1590,XIV.,Till (if it’s not too coarse to state)
1591,XIV.,"There happened what I simply hate,"
1592,XIV.,My nose began to bleed.
1593,XIV.,"Then, I admit, I said a word"
1594,XIV.,Which luckily they never heard;
1595,XIV.,But in a very little while
1596,XIV.,My calm and my contemptuous smile
1597,XIV.,Compelled them to proceed.
1598,XIV.,They filed my canine teeth to points
1599,XIV.,And made me bite my tongue.
1600,XIV.,"They racked me till they burst my joints,"
1601,XIV.,And after that they hung
1602,XIV.,A stone upon my neck that weighed
1603,XIV.,"At least a hundred pounds, and made"
1604,XIV.,"Me run like mad for twenty miles,"
1605,XIV.,And climb a lot of lofty stiles.
1606,XIV.,"They tried a dodge that rarely fails,"
1607,XIV.,The tub of Regulus with nails--
1608,XIV.,"The cask is rather rude and flat,"
1609,XIV.,But native casks are all like that--
1610,XIV.,"The nails stuck in for quite an inch,"
1611,XIV.,But did I flinch? I did not flinch.
1612,XIV.,
1613,XIV.,[Illustration ** Our traveller trapped in a nail-studded barrel
1614,XIV.,singing and the barrel being rolled by an African.]
1615,XIV.,
1616,XIV.,"In tones determined, loud, and strong"
1617,XIV.,"I sang a patriotic song,"
1618,XIV.,Thank Heaven it did not last for long!
1619,XIV.,My misery was past;
1620,XIV.,My superhuman courage rose
1621,XIV.,Superior to my savage foes;
1622,XIV.,They worshipped me at last.
1623,XIV.,"With many heartfelt compliments,"
1624,XIV.,"They sent me back at their expense,"
1625,XIV.,And here I am returned to find
1626,XIV.,The pleasures I had left behind.
1627,XIV.,
1628,XIV.,To go the London rounds!
1629,XIV.,To note the quite peculiar air
1630,XIV.,"Of courtesy, and everywhere"
1631,XIV.,The same unfailing public trust
1632,XIV.,In manuscript that fetches just
1633,XIV.,"A thousand! not of thin Rupees,"
1634,XIV.,"Nor Reis (which are Portuguese),"
1635,XIV.,Nor Rubles; but a thousand clear
1636,XIV.,"Of heavy, round, impressive, dear,"
1637,XIV.,Familiar English pounds!
1638,XIV.,
1639,XIV.,"Oh! England, who would leave thy shores--"
1640,XIV.,"Excuse me, but I see it bores"
1641,XIV.,A busy journalist
1642,XIV.,To hear a rhapsody which he
1643,XIV.,"Could write without detaining me,"
1644,XIV.,So I will not insist.
1645,XIV.,Only permit me once again
1646,XIV.,To make it clearly understood
1647,XIV.,"That both those honourable men,"
1648,XIV.,"Commander Sin and Captain Blood,"
1649,XIV.,"Would swear to all that I have said,"
1650,XIV.,Were they alive;
1651,XIV.,but they are dead!
