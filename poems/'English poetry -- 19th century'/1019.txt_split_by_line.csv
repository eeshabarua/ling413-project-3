18,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.
19,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
20,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"I've quench'd my lamp, I struck it in that start"
21,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Which every limb convulsed, I heard it fall--"
22,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"The crash blent with my sleep, I saw depart"
23,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Its light, even as I woke, on yonder wall;"
24,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Over against my bed, there shone a gleam"
25,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Strange, faint, and mingling also with my dream."
26,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
27,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"It sank, and I am wrapt in utter gloom;"
28,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"How far is night advanced, and when will day"
29,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Retinge the dusk and livid air with bloom,"
30,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"And fill this void with warm, creative ray?"
31,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Would I could sleep again till, clear and red,"
32,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Morning shall on the mountain-tops be spread!
33,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
34,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"I'd call my women, but to break their sleep,"
35,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Because my own is broken, were unjust;"
36,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"They've wrought all day, and well-earn'd slumbers steep"
37,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Their labours in forgetfulness, I trust;"
38,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Let me my feverish watch with patience bear,"
39,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Thankful that none with me its sufferings share.
40,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
41,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Yet, oh, for light! one ray would tranquillize"
42,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"My nerves, my pulses, more than effort can;"
43,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,I'll draw my curtain and consult the skies:
44,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"These trembling stars at dead of night look wan,"
45,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Wild, restless, strange, yet cannot be more drear"
46,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Than this my couch, shared by a nameless fear."
47,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
48,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"All black--one great cloud, drawn from east to west,"
49,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Conceals the heavens, but there are lights below;"
50,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Torches burn in Jerusalem, and cast"
51,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,On yonder stony mount a lurid glow.
52,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"I see men station'd there, and gleaming spears;"
53,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"A sound, too, from afar, invades my ears."
54,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
55,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Dull, measured strokes of axe and hammer ring"
56,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"From street to street, not loud, but through the night"
57,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Distinctly heard--and some strange spectral thing
58,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Is now uprear'd--and, fix'd against the light"
59,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Of the pale lamps, defined upon that sky,"
60,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"It stands up like a column, straight and high."
61,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
62,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,I see it all--I know the dusky sign--
63,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"A cross on Calvary, which Jews uprear"
64,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,While Romans watch; and when the dawn shall shine
65,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Pilate, to judge the victim, will appear--"
66,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Pass sentence-yield Him up to crucify;
67,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,And on that cross the spotless Christ must die.
68,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
69,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Dreams, then, are true--for thus my vision ran;"
70,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Surely some oracle has been with me,"
71,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"The gods have chosen me to reveal their plan,"
72,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,To warn an unjust judge of destiny:
73,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"I, slumbering, heard and saw; awake I know,"
74,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Christ's coming death, and Pilate's life of woe."
75,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
76,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,I do not weep for Pilate--who could prove
77,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Regret for him whose cold and crushing sway
78,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"No prayer can soften, no appeal can move:"
79,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Who tramples hearts as others trample clay,"
80,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Yet with a faltering, an uncertain tread,"
81,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,That might stir up reprisal in the dead.
82,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
83,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Forced to sit by his side and see his deeds;
84,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Forced to behold that visage, hour by hour,"
85,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,In whose gaunt lines the abhorrent gazer reads
86,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"A triple lust of gold, and blood, and power;"
87,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"A soul whom motives fierce, yet abject, urge--"
88,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Rome's servile slave, and Judah's tyrant scourge."
89,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
90,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"How can I love, or mourn, or pity him?"
91,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"I, who so long my fetter'd hands have wrung;"
92,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"I, who for grief have wept my eyesight dim;"
93,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Because, while life for me was bright and young,"
94,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,He robb'd my youth--he quench'd my life's fair ray--
95,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"He crush'd my mind, and did my freedom slay."
96,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
97,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,And at this hour-although I be his wife--
98,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,He has no more of tenderness from me
99,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Than any other wretch of guilty life;
100,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Less, for I know his household privacy--"
101,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,I see him as he is--without a screen;
102,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"And, by the gods, my soul abhors his mien!"
103,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
104,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Has he not sought my presence, dyed in blood--"
105,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Innocent, righteous blood, shed shamelessly?"
106,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,And have I not his red salute withstood?
107,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Ay, when, as erst, he plunged all Galilee"
108,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"In dark bereavement--in affliction sore,"
109,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Mingling their very offerings with their gore.
110,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
111,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Then came he--in his eyes a serpent-smile,"
112,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Upon his lips some false, endearing word,"
113,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,And through the streets of Salem clang'd the while
114,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"His slaughtering, hacking, sacrilegious sword--"
115,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"And I, to see a man cause men such woe,"
116,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Trembled with ire--I did not fear to show.
117,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
118,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"And now, the envious Jewish priests have brought"
119,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Jesus--whom they in mock'ry call their king--
120,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"To have, by this grim power, their vengeance wrought;"
121,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"By this mean reptile, innocence to sting."
122,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Oh! could I but the purposed doom avert,"
123,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,And shield the blameless head from cruel hurt!
124,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
125,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Accessible is Pilate's heart to fear,"
126,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Omens will shake his soul, like autumn leaf;"
127,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Could he this night's appalling vision hear,"
128,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"This just man's bonds were loosed, his life were safe,"
129,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Unless that bitter priesthood should prevail,"
130,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,And make even terror to their malice quail.
131,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
132,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Yet if I tell the dream--but let me pause.
133,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"What dream? Erewhile the characters were clear,"
134,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Graved on my brain--at once some unknown cause
135,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Has dimm'd and razed the thoughts, which now appear,"
136,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Like a vague remnant of some by-past scene;--
137,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Not what will be, but what, long since, has been."
138,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
139,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,I suffer'd many things--I heard foretold
140,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"A dreadful doom for Pilate,--lingering woes,"
141,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"In far, barbarian climes, where mountains cold"
142,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Built up a solitude of trackless snows,"
143,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"There he and grisly wolves prowl'd side by side,"
144,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"There he lived famish'd--there, methought, he died;"
145,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
146,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"But not of hunger, nor by malady;"
147,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"I saw the snow around him, stain'd with gore;"
148,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"I said I had no tears for such as he,"
149,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"And, lo! my cheek is wet--mine eyes run o'er;"
150,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"I weep for mortal suffering, mortal guilt,"
151,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"I weep the impious deed, the blood self-spilt."
152,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
153,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"More I recall not, yet the vision spread"
154,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Into a world remote, an age to come--"
155,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,And still the illumined name of Jesus shed
156,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"A light, a clearness, through the unfolding gloom--"
157,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"And still I saw that sign, which now I see,"
158,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,That cross on yonder brow of Calvary.
159,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
160,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,What is this Hebrew Christ?-to me unknown
161,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,His lineage--doctrine--mission; yet how clear
162,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Is God-like goodness in his actions shown,"
163,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,How straight and stainless is his life's career!
164,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"The ray of Deity that rests on him,"
165,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,In my eyes makes Olympian glory dim.
166,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
167,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,The world advances; Greek or Roman rite
168,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Suffices not the inquiring mind to stay;
169,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,The searching soul demands a purer light
170,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"To guide it on its upward, onward way;"
171,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Ashamed of sculptured gods, Religion turns"
172,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,To where the unseen Jehovah's altar burns.
173,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
174,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Our faith is rotten, all our rites defiled,"
175,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Our temples sullied, and, methinks, this man,"
176,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"With his new ordinance, so wise and mild,"
177,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Is come, even as He says, the chaff to fan"
178,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,And sever from the wheat; but will his faith
179,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Survive the terrors of to-morrow's death?
180,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
181,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,*     *     *     *     *     *     *
182,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
183,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,I feel a firmer trust--a higher hope
184,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Rise in my soul--it dawns with dawning day;
185,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Lo! on the Temple's roof--on Moriah's slope
186,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Appears at length that clear and crimson ray
187,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Which I so wished for when shut in by night;
188,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Oh, opening skies, I hail, I bless pour light!"
189,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
190,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Part, clouds and shadows! Glorious Sun appear!"
191,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Part, mental gloom!  Come insight from on high!"
192,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Dusk dawn in heaven still strives with daylight clear
193,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,The longing soul doth still uncertain sigh.
194,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"Oh! to behold the truth--that sun divine,"
195,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"How doth my bosom pant, my spirit pine!"
196,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,
197,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"This day, Time travails with a mighty birth;"
198,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"This day, Truth stoops from heaven and visits earth;"
199,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,Ere night descends I shall more surely know
200,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"What guide to follow, in what path to go;"
201,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,"I wait in hope--I wait in solemn fear,"
202,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,The oracle of God--the sole--true God--to hear.
203,PILATE'S WIFE'S DREAM.,

207,MEMENTOS.,MEMENTOS.
208,MEMENTOS.,
209,MEMENTOS.,Arranging long-locked drawers and shelves
210,MEMENTOS.,"Of cabinets, shut up for years,"
211,MEMENTOS.,What a strange task we've set ourselves!
212,MEMENTOS.,How still the lonely room appears!
213,MEMENTOS.,"How strange this mass of ancient treasures,"
214,MEMENTOS.,Mementos of past pains and pleasures;
215,MEMENTOS.,"These volumes, clasped with costly stone,"
216,MEMENTOS.,"With print all faded, gilding gone;"
217,MEMENTOS.,
218,MEMENTOS.,These fans of leaves from Indian trees--
219,MEMENTOS.,"These crimson shells, from Indian seas--"
220,MEMENTOS.,"These tiny portraits, set in rings--"
221,MEMENTOS.,"Once, doubtless, deemed such precious things;"
222,MEMENTOS.,"Keepsakes bestowed by Love on Faith,"
223,MEMENTOS.,"And worn till the receiver's death,"
224,MEMENTOS.,"Now stored with cameos, china, shells,"
225,MEMENTOS.,In this old closet's dusty cells.
226,MEMENTOS.,
227,MEMENTOS.,"I scarcely think, for ten long years,"
228,MEMENTOS.,A hand has touched these relics old;
229,MEMENTOS.,"And, coating each, slow-formed, appears"
230,MEMENTOS.,The growth of green and antique mould.
231,MEMENTOS.,
232,MEMENTOS.,All in this house is mossing over;
233,MEMENTOS.,"All is unused, and dim, and damp;"
234,MEMENTOS.,"Nor light, nor warmth, the rooms discover--"
235,MEMENTOS.,Bereft for years of fire and lamp.
236,MEMENTOS.,
237,MEMENTOS.,"The sun, sometimes in summer, enters"
238,MEMENTOS.,"The casements, with reviving ray;"
239,MEMENTOS.,But the long rains of many winters
240,MEMENTOS.,Moulder the very walls away.
241,MEMENTOS.,
242,MEMENTOS.,"And outside all is ivy, clinging"
243,MEMENTOS.,"To chimney, lattice, gable grey;"
244,MEMENTOS.,Scarcely one little red rose springing
245,MEMENTOS.,Through the green moss can force its way.
246,MEMENTOS.,
247,MEMENTOS.,"Unscared, the daw and starling nestle,"
248,MEMENTOS.,"Where the tall turret rises high,"
249,MEMENTOS.,And winds alone come near to rustle
250,MEMENTOS.,"The thick leaves where their cradles lie,"
251,MEMENTOS.,
252,MEMENTOS.,"I sometimes think, when late at even"
253,MEMENTOS.,"I climb the stair reluctantly,"
254,MEMENTOS.,"Some shape that should be well in heaven,"
255,MEMENTOS.,"Or ill elsewhere, will pass by me."
256,MEMENTOS.,
257,MEMENTOS.,"I fear to see the very faces,"
258,MEMENTOS.,"Familiar thirty years ago,"
259,MEMENTOS.,Even in the old accustomed places
260,MEMENTOS.,"Which look so cold and gloomy now,"
261,MEMENTOS.,
262,MEMENTOS.,"I've come, to close the window, hither,"
263,MEMENTOS.,"At twilight, when the sun was down,"
264,MEMENTOS.,"And Fear my very soul would wither,"
265,MEMENTOS.,"Lest something should be dimly shown,"
266,MEMENTOS.,
267,MEMENTOS.,"Too much the buried form resembling,"
268,MEMENTOS.,Of her who once was mistress here;
269,MEMENTOS.,"Lest doubtful shade, or moonbeam trembling,"
270,MEMENTOS.,"Might take her aspect, once so dear."
271,MEMENTOS.,
272,MEMENTOS.,Hers was this chamber; in her time
273,MEMENTOS.,"It seemed to me a pleasant room,"
274,MEMENTOS.,For then no cloud of grief or crime
275,MEMENTOS.,Had cursed it with a settled gloom;
276,MEMENTOS.,
277,MEMENTOS.,I had not seen death's image laid
278,MEMENTOS.,"In shroud and sheet, on yonder bed."
279,MEMENTOS.,"Before she married, she was blest--"
280,MEMENTOS.,"Blest in her youth, blest in her worth;"
281,MEMENTOS.,"Her mind was calm, its sunny rest"
282,MEMENTOS.,Shone in her eyes more clear than mirth.
283,MEMENTOS.,
284,MEMENTOS.,"And when attired in rich array,"
285,MEMENTOS.,"Light, lustrous hair about her brow,"
286,MEMENTOS.,"She yonder sat, a kind of day"
287,MEMENTOS.,Lit up what seems so gloomy now.
288,MEMENTOS.,These grim oak walls even then were grim;
289,MEMENTOS.,That old carved chair was then antique;
290,MEMENTOS.,But what around looked dusk and dim
291,MEMENTOS.,Served as a foil to her fresh cheek;
292,MEMENTOS.,"Her neck and arms, of hue so fair,"
293,MEMENTOS.,"Eyes of unclouded, smiling light;"
294,MEMENTOS.,"Her soft, and curled, and floating hair,"
295,MEMENTOS.,"Gems and attire, as rainbow bright."
296,MEMENTOS.,
297,MEMENTOS.,"Reclined in yonder deep recess,"
298,MEMENTOS.,"Ofttimes she would, at evening, lie"
299,MEMENTOS.,Watching the sun; she seemed to bless
300,MEMENTOS.,With happy glance the glorious sky.
301,MEMENTOS.,"She loved such scenes, and as she gazed,"
302,MEMENTOS.,Her face evinced her spirit's mood;
303,MEMENTOS.,Beauty or grandeur ever raised
304,MEMENTOS.,"In her, a deep-felt gratitude."
305,MEMENTOS.,"But of all lovely things, she loved"
306,MEMENTOS.,"A cloudless moon, on summer night,"
307,MEMENTOS.,Full oft have I impatience proved
308,MEMENTOS.,To see how long her still delight
309,MEMENTOS.,"Would find a theme in reverie,"
310,MEMENTOS.,"Out on the lawn, or where the trees"
311,MEMENTOS.,"Let in the lustre fitfully,"
312,MEMENTOS.,"As their boughs parted momently,"
313,MEMENTOS.,"To the soft, languid, summer breeze."
314,MEMENTOS.,Alas! that she should e'er have flung
315,MEMENTOS.,"Those pure, though lonely joys away--"
316,MEMENTOS.,"Deceived by false and guileful tongue,"
317,MEMENTOS.,"She gave her hand, then suffered wrong;"
318,MEMENTOS.,"Oppressed, ill-used, she faded young,"
319,MEMENTOS.,And died of grief by slow decay.
320,MEMENTOS.,
321,MEMENTOS.,Open that casket-look how bright
322,MEMENTOS.,Those jewels flash upon the sight;
323,MEMENTOS.,The brilliants have not lost a ray
324,MEMENTOS.,"Of lustre, since her wedding day."
325,MEMENTOS.,But see--upon that pearly chain--
326,MEMENTOS.,How dim lies Time's discolouring stain!
327,MEMENTOS.,I've seen that by her daughter worn:
328,MEMENTOS.,"For, ere she died, a child was born;--"
329,MEMENTOS.,"A child that ne'er its mother knew,"
330,MEMENTOS.,"That lone, and almost friendless grew;"
331,MEMENTOS.,"For, ever, when its step drew nigh,"
332,MEMENTOS.,Averted was the father's eye;
333,MEMENTOS.,"And then, a life impure and wild"
334,MEMENTOS.,Made him a stranger to his child:
335,MEMENTOS.,"Absorbed in vice, he little cared"
336,MEMENTOS.,"On what she did, or how she fared."
337,MEMENTOS.,"The love withheld she never sought,"
338,MEMENTOS.,She grew uncherished--learnt untaught;
339,MEMENTOS.,To her the inward life of thought
340,MEMENTOS.,Full soon was open laid.
341,MEMENTOS.,I know not if her friendlessness
342,MEMENTOS.,"Did sometimes on her spirit press,"
343,MEMENTOS.,But plaint she never made.
344,MEMENTOS.,"The book-shelves were her darling treasure,"
345,MEMENTOS.,She rarely seemed the time to measure
346,MEMENTOS.,While she could read alone.
347,MEMENTOS.,And she too loved the twilight wood
348,MEMENTOS.,"And often, in her mother's mood,"
349,MEMENTOS.,"Away to yonder hill would hie,"
350,MEMENTOS.,"Like her, to watch the setting sun,"
351,MEMENTOS.,"Or see the stars born, one by one,"
352,MEMENTOS.,Out of the darkening sky.
353,MEMENTOS.,Nor would she leave that hill till night
354,MEMENTOS.,Trembled from pole to pole with light;
355,MEMENTOS.,"Even then, upon her homeward way,"
356,MEMENTOS.,Long--long her wandering steps delayed
357,MEMENTOS.,"To quit the sombre forest shade,"
358,MEMENTOS.,Through which her eerie pathway lay.
359,MEMENTOS.,You ask if she had beauty's grace?
360,MEMENTOS.,I know not--but a nobler face
361,MEMENTOS.,My eyes have seldom seen;
362,MEMENTOS.,"A keen and fine intelligence,"
363,MEMENTOS.,"And, better still, the truest sense"
364,MEMENTOS.,Were in her speaking mien.
365,MEMENTOS.,"But bloom or lustre was there none,"
366,MEMENTOS.,"Only at moments, fitful shone"
367,MEMENTOS.,"An ardour in her eye,"
368,MEMENTOS.,"That kindled on her cheek a flush,"
369,MEMENTOS.,Warm as a red sky's passing blush
370,MEMENTOS.,And quick with energy.
371,MEMENTOS.,"Her speech, too, was not common speech,"
372,MEMENTOS.,"No wish to shine, or aim to teach,"
373,MEMENTOS.,Was in her words displayed:
374,MEMENTOS.,"She still began with quiet sense,"
375,MEMENTOS.,But oft the force of eloquence
376,MEMENTOS.,Came to her lips in aid;
377,MEMENTOS.,"Language and voice unconscious changed,"
378,MEMENTOS.,"And thoughts, in other words arranged,"
379,MEMENTOS.,Her fervid soul transfused
380,MEMENTOS.,"Into the hearts of those who heard,"
381,MEMENTOS.,"And transient strength and ardour stirred,"
382,MEMENTOS.,"In minds to strength unused,"
383,MEMENTOS.,"Yet in gay crowd or festal glare,"
384,MEMENTOS.,Grave and retiring was her air;
385,MEMENTOS.,"'Twas seldom, save with me alone,"
386,MEMENTOS.,That fire of feeling freely shone;
387,MEMENTOS.,"She loved not awe's nor wonder's gaze,"
388,MEMENTOS.,"Nor even exaggerated praise,"
389,MEMENTOS.,"Nor even notice, if too keen"
390,MEMENTOS.,The curious gazer searched her mien.
391,MEMENTOS.,Nature's own green expanse revealed
392,MEMENTOS.,"The world, the pleasures, she could prize;"
393,MEMENTOS.,"On free hill-side, in sunny field,"
394,MEMENTOS.,"In quiet spots by woods concealed,"
395,MEMENTOS.,"Grew wild and fresh her chosen joys,"
396,MEMENTOS.,Yet Nature's feelings deeply lay
397,MEMENTOS.,In that endowed and youthful frame;
398,MEMENTOS.,"Shrined in her heart and hid from day,"
399,MEMENTOS.,They burned unseen with silent flame.
400,MEMENTOS.,"In youth's first search for mental light,"
401,MEMENTOS.,"She lived but to reflect and learn,"
402,MEMENTOS.,But soon her mind's maturer might
403,MEMENTOS.,For stronger task did pant and yearn;
404,MEMENTOS.,"And stronger task did fate assign,"
405,MEMENTOS.,Task that a giant's strength might strain;
406,MEMENTOS.,"To suffer long and ne'er repine,"
407,MEMENTOS.,"Be calm in frenzy, smile at pain."
408,MEMENTOS.,
409,MEMENTOS.,"Pale with the secret war of feeling,"
410,MEMENTOS.,"Sustained with courage, mute, yet high;"
411,MEMENTOS.,"The wounds at which she bled, revealing"
412,MEMENTOS.,Only by altered cheek and eye;
413,MEMENTOS.,
414,MEMENTOS.,She bore in silence--but when passion
415,MEMENTOS.,"Surged in her soul with ceaseless foam,"
416,MEMENTOS.,"The storm at last brought desolation,"
417,MEMENTOS.,And drove her exiled from her home.
418,MEMENTOS.,
419,MEMENTOS.,"And silent still, she straight assembled"
420,MEMENTOS.,The wrecks of strength her soul retained;
421,MEMENTOS.,"For though the wasted body trembled,"
422,MEMENTOS.,"The unconquered mind, to quail, disdained."
423,MEMENTOS.,
424,MEMENTOS.,She crossed the sea--now lone she wanders
425,MEMENTOS.,"By Seine's, or Rhine's, or Arno's flow;"
426,MEMENTOS.,Fain would I know if distance renders
427,MEMENTOS.,Relief or comfort to her woe.
428,MEMENTOS.,
429,MEMENTOS.,"Fain would I know if, henceforth, ever,"
430,MEMENTOS.,"These eyes shall read in hers again,"
431,MEMENTOS.,"That light of love which faded never,"
432,MEMENTOS.,Though dimmed so long with secret pain.
433,MEMENTOS.,
434,MEMENTOS.,"She will return, but cold and altered,"
435,MEMENTOS.,Like all whose hopes too soon depart;
436,MEMENTOS.,"Like all on whom have beat, unsheltered,"
437,MEMENTOS.,The bitter blasts that blight the heart.
438,MEMENTOS.,
439,MEMENTOS.,No more shall I behold her lying
440,MEMENTOS.,"Calm on a pillow, smoothed by me;"
441,MEMENTOS.,"No more that spirit, worn with sighing,"
442,MEMENTOS.,Will know the rest of infancy.
443,MEMENTOS.,
444,MEMENTOS.,"If still the paths of lore she follow,"
445,MEMENTOS.,'Twill be with tired and goaded will;
446,MEMENTOS.,"She'll only toil, the aching hollow,"
447,MEMENTOS.,The joyless blank of life to fill.
448,MEMENTOS.,
449,MEMENTOS.,"And oh! full oft, quite spent and weary,"
450,MEMENTOS.,"Her hand will pause, her head decline;"
451,MEMENTOS.,"That labour seems so hard and dreary,"
452,MEMENTOS.,On which no ray of hope may shine.
453,MEMENTOS.,
454,MEMENTOS.,Thus the pale blight of time and sorrow
455,MEMENTOS.,"Will shade with grey her soft, dark hair;"
456,MEMENTOS.,"Then comes the day that knows no morrow,"
457,MEMENTOS.,And death succeeds to long despair.
458,MEMENTOS.,
459,MEMENTOS.,"So speaks experience, sage and hoary;"
460,MEMENTOS.,"I see it plainly, know it well,"
461,MEMENTOS.,"Like one who, having read a story,"
462,MEMENTOS.,Each incident therein can tell.
463,MEMENTOS.,
464,MEMENTOS.,"Touch not that ring; 'twas his, the sire"
465,MEMENTOS.,Of that forsaken child;
466,MEMENTOS.,And nought his relics can inspire
467,MEMENTOS.,"Save memories, sin-defiled."
468,MEMENTOS.,
469,MEMENTOS.,"I, who sat by his wife's death-bed,"
470,MEMENTOS.,"I, who his daughter loved,"
471,MEMENTOS.,"Could almost curse the guilty dead,"
472,MEMENTOS.,For woes the guiltless proved.
473,MEMENTOS.,
474,MEMENTOS.,"And heaven did curse--they found him laid,"
475,MEMENTOS.,"When crime for wrath was rife,"
476,MEMENTOS.,Cold--with the suicidal blade
477,MEMENTOS.,Clutched in his desperate gripe.
478,MEMENTOS.,
479,MEMENTOS.,"'Twas near that long deserted hut,"
480,MEMENTOS.,"Which in the wood decays,"
481,MEMENTOS.,"Death's axe, self-wielded, struck his root,"
482,MEMENTOS.,And lopped his desperate days.
483,MEMENTOS.,
484,MEMENTOS.,"You know the spot, where three black trees,"
485,MEMENTOS.,"Lift up their branches fell,"
486,MEMENTOS.,"And moaning, ceaseless as the seas,"
487,MEMENTOS.,"Still seem, in every passing breeze,"
488,MEMENTOS.,The deed of blood to tell.
489,MEMENTOS.,
490,MEMENTOS.,"They named him mad, and laid his bones"
491,MEMENTOS.,Where holier ashes lie;
492,MEMENTOS.,Yet doubt not that his spirit groans
493,MEMENTOS.,In hell's eternity.
494,MEMENTOS.,
495,MEMENTOS.,"But, lo! night, closing o'er the earth,"
496,MEMENTOS.,Infects our thoughts with gloom;
497,MEMENTOS.,"Come, let us strive to rally mirth"
498,MEMENTOS.,Where glows a clear and tranquil hearth
499,MEMENTOS.,In some more cheerful room.

504,THE WIFE'S WILL.,THE WIFE'S WILL.
505,THE WIFE'S WILL.,
506,THE WIFE'S WILL.,Sit still--a word--a breath may break
507,THE WIFE'S WILL.,(As light airs stir a sleeping lake)
508,THE WIFE'S WILL.,The glassy calm that soothes my woes--
509,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"The sweet, the deep, the full repose."
510,THE WIFE'S WILL.,O leave me not! for ever be
511,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Thus, more than life itself to me!"
512,THE WIFE'S WILL.,
513,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Yes, close beside thee let me kneel--"
514,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Give me thy hand, that I may feel"
515,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"The friend so true--so tried--so dear,"
516,THE WIFE'S WILL.,My heart's own chosen--indeed is near;
517,THE WIFE'S WILL.,And check me not--this hour divine
518,THE WIFE'S WILL.,Belongs to me--is fully mine.
519,THE WIFE'S WILL.,
520,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"'Tis thy own hearth thou sitt'st beside,"
521,THE WIFE'S WILL.,After long absence--wandering wide;
522,THE WIFE'S WILL.,'Tis thy own wife reads in thine eyes
523,THE WIFE'S WILL.,A promise clear of stormless skies;
524,THE WIFE'S WILL.,For faith and true love light the rays
525,THE WIFE'S WILL.,Which shine responsive to her gaze.
526,THE WIFE'S WILL.,
527,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Ay,--well that single tear may fall;"
528,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Ten thousand might mine eyes recall,"
529,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Which from their lids ran blinding fast,"
530,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"In hours of grief, yet scarcely past;"
531,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Well mayst thou speak of love to me,"
532,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"For, oh!  most truly--I love thee!"
533,THE WIFE'S WILL.,
534,THE WIFE'S WILL.,Yet smile--for we are happy now.
535,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Whence, then, that sadness on thy brow?"
536,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"What sayst thou?"" We muse once again,"
537,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Ere long, be severed by the main!"""
538,THE WIFE'S WILL.,I knew not this--I deemed no more
539,THE WIFE'S WILL.,Thy step would err from Britain's shore.
540,THE WIFE'S WILL.,
541,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"""Duty commands!"" 'Tis true--'tis just;"
542,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Thy slightest word I wholly trust,"
543,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Nor by request, nor faintest sigh,"
544,THE WIFE'S WILL.,Would I to turn thy purpose try;
545,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"But, William, hear my solemn vow--"
546,THE WIFE'S WILL.,Hear and confirm!--with thee I go.
547,THE WIFE'S WILL.,
548,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"""Distance and suffering,"" didst thou say?"
549,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"""Danger by night, and toil by day?"""
550,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Oh, idle words and vain are these;"
551,THE WIFE'S WILL.,Hear me! I cross with thee the seas.
552,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Such risk as thou must meet and dare,"
553,THE WIFE'S WILL.,I--thy true wife--will duly share.
554,THE WIFE'S WILL.,
555,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Passive, at home, I will not pine;"
556,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Thy toils, thy perils shall be mine;"
557,THE WIFE'S WILL.,Grant this--and be hereafter paid
558,THE WIFE'S WILL.,By a warm heart's devoted aid:
559,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"'Tis granted--with that yielding kiss,"
560,THE WIFE'S WILL.,Entered my soul unmingled bliss.
561,THE WIFE'S WILL.,
562,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Thanks, William, thanks! thy love has joy,"
563,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Pure, undefiled with base alloy;"
564,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"'Tis not a passion, false and blind,"
565,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Inspires, enchains, absorbs my mind;"
566,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"Worthy, I feel, art thou to be"
567,THE WIFE'S WILL.,Loved with my perfect energy.
568,THE WIFE'S WILL.,
569,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"This evening now shall sweetly flow,"
570,THE WIFE'S WILL.,Lit by our clear fire's happy glow;
571,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"And parting's peace-embittering fear,"
572,THE WIFE'S WILL.,Is warned our hearts to come not near;
573,THE WIFE'S WILL.,"For fate admits my soul's decree,"
574,THE WIFE'S WILL.,In bliss or bale--to go with thee!
575,THE WIFE'S WILL.,
576,THE WIFE'S WILL.,
577,THE WOOD.,THE WOOD.
578,THE WOOD.,
579,THE WOOD.,"But two miles more, and then we rest!"
580,THE WOOD.,"Well, there is still an hour of day,"
581,THE WOOD.,And long the brightness of the West
582,THE WOOD.,Will light us on our devious way;
583,THE WOOD.,"Sit then, awhile, here in this wood--"
584,THE WOOD.,"So total is the solitude,"
585,THE WOOD.,We safely may delay.
586,THE WOOD.,
587,THE WOOD.,"These massive roots afford a seat,"
588,THE WOOD.,Which seems for weary travellers made.
589,THE WOOD.,There rest. The air is soft and sweet
590,THE WOOD.,"In this sequestered forest glade,"
591,THE WOOD.,"And there are scents of flowers around,"
592,THE WOOD.,The evening dew draws from the ground;
593,THE WOOD.,How soothingly they spread!
594,THE WOOD.,
595,THE WOOD.,"Yes; I was tired, but not at heart;"
596,THE WOOD.,"No--that beats full of sweet content,"
597,THE WOOD.,For now I have my natural part
598,THE WOOD.,Of action with adventure blent;
599,THE WOOD.,"Cast forth on the wide world with thee,"
600,THE WOOD.,And all my once waste energy
601,THE WOOD.,To weighty purpose bent.
602,THE WOOD.,
603,THE WOOD.,"Yet--sayst thou, spies around us roam,"
604,THE WOOD.,Our aims are termed conspiracy?
605,THE WOOD.,"Haply, no more our English home"
606,THE WOOD.,An anchorage for us may be?
607,THE WOOD.,That there is risk our mutual blood
608,THE WOOD.,May redden in some lonely wood
609,THE WOOD.,The knife of treachery?
610,THE WOOD.,
611,THE WOOD.,"Sayst thou, that where we lodge each night,"
612,THE WOOD.,"In each lone farm, or lonelier hall"
613,THE WOOD.,Of Norman Peer--ere morning light
614,THE WOOD.,"Suspicion must as duly fall,"
615,THE WOOD.,As day returns--such vigilance
616,THE WOOD.,"Presides and watches over France,"
617,THE WOOD.,Such rigour governs all?
618,THE WOOD.,
619,THE WOOD.,"I fear not, William; dost thou fear?"
620,THE WOOD.,"So that the knife does not divide,"
621,THE WOOD.,It may be ever hovering near:
622,THE WOOD.,"I could not tremble at thy side,"
623,THE WOOD.,And strenuous love--like mine for thee--
624,THE WOOD.,"Is buckler strong 'gainst treachery,"
625,THE WOOD.,And turns its stab aside.
626,THE WOOD.,
627,THE WOOD.,I am resolved that thou shalt learn
628,THE WOOD.,To trust my strength as I trust thine;
629,THE WOOD.,I am resolved our souls shall burn
630,THE WOOD.,"With equal, steady, mingling shine;"
631,THE WOOD.,"Part of the field is conquered now,"
632,THE WOOD.,"Our lives in the same channel flow,"
633,THE WOOD.,Along the self-same line;
634,THE WOOD.,
635,THE WOOD.,"And while no groaning storm is heard,"
636,THE WOOD.,"Thou seem'st content it should be so,"
637,THE WOOD.,But soon as comes a warning word
638,THE WOOD.,Of danger--straight thine anxious brow
639,THE WOOD.,"Bends over me a mournful shade,"
640,THE WOOD.,As doubting if my powers are made
641,THE WOOD.,To ford the floods of woe.
642,THE WOOD.,
643,THE WOOD.,"Know, then it is my spirit swells,"
644,THE WOOD.,"And drinks, with eager joy, the air"
645,THE WOOD.,"Of freedom--where at last it dwells,"
646,THE WOOD.,"Chartered, a common task to share"
647,THE WOOD.,"With thee, and then it stirs alert,"
648,THE WOOD.,And pants to learn what menaced hurt
649,THE WOOD.,Demands for thee its care.
650,THE WOOD.,
651,THE WOOD.,"Remember, I have crossed the deep,"
652,THE WOOD.,"And stood with thee on deck, to gaze"
653,THE WOOD.,"On waves that rose in threatening heap,"
654,THE WOOD.,"While stagnant lay a heavy haze,"
655,THE WOOD.,"Dimly confusing sea with sky,"
656,THE WOOD.,"And baffling, even, the pilot's eye,"
657,THE WOOD.,Intent to thread the maze--
658,THE WOOD.,
659,THE WOOD.,"Of rocks, on Bretagne's dangerous coast,"
660,THE WOOD.,And find a way to steer our band
661,THE WOOD.,"To the one point obscure, which lost,"
662,THE WOOD.,"Flung us, as victims, on the strand;--"
663,THE WOOD.,"All, elsewhere, gleamed the Gallic sword,"
664,THE WOOD.,And not a wherry could be moored
665,THE WOOD.,Along the guarded land.
666,THE WOOD.,
667,THE WOOD.,I feared not then--I fear not now;
668,THE WOOD.,The interest of each stirring scene
669,THE WOOD.,"Wakes a new sense, a welcome glow,"
670,THE WOOD.,In every nerve and bounding vein;
671,THE WOOD.,"Alike on turbid Channel sea,"
672,THE WOOD.,"Or in still wood of Normandy,"
673,THE WOOD.,I feel as born again.
674,THE WOOD.,
675,THE WOOD.,The rain descended that wild morn
676,THE WOOD.,"When, anchoring in the cove at last,"
677,THE WOOD.,"Our band, all weary and forlorn"
678,THE WOOD.,"Ashore, like wave-worn sailors, cast--"
679,THE WOOD.,"Sought for a sheltering roof in vain,"
680,THE WOOD.,And scarce could scanty food obtain
681,THE WOOD.,To break their morning fast.
682,THE WOOD.,
683,THE WOOD.,"Thou didst thy crust with me divide,"
684,THE WOOD.,Thou didst thy cloak around me fold;
685,THE WOOD.,"And, sitting silent by thy side,"
686,THE WOOD.,I ate the bread in peace untold:
687,THE WOOD.,"Given kindly from thy hand, 'twas sweet"
688,THE WOOD.,As costly fare or princely treat
689,THE WOOD.,On royal plate of gold.
690,THE WOOD.,
691,THE WOOD.,"Sharp blew the sleet upon my face,"
692,THE WOOD.,"And, rising wild, the gusty wind"
693,THE WOOD.,"Drove on those thundering waves apace,"
694,THE WOOD.,Our crew so late had left behind;
695,THE WOOD.,"But, spite of frozen shower and storm,"
696,THE WOOD.,"So close to thee, my heart beat warm,"
697,THE WOOD.,And tranquil slept my mind.
698,THE WOOD.,
699,THE WOOD.,So now--nor foot-sore nor opprest
700,THE WOOD.,"With walking all this August day,"
701,THE WOOD.,"I taste a heaven in this brief rest,"
702,THE WOOD.,This gipsy-halt beside the way.
703,THE WOOD.,"England's wild flowers are fair to view,"
704,THE WOOD.,Like balm is England's summer dew
705,THE WOOD.,Like gold her sunset ray.
706,THE WOOD.,
707,THE WOOD.,"But the white violets, growing here,"
708,THE WOOD.,"Are sweeter than I yet have seen,"
709,THE WOOD.,And ne'er did dew so pure and clear
710,THE WOOD.,"Distil on forest mosses green,"
711,THE WOOD.,"As now, called forth by summer heat,"
712,THE WOOD.,Perfumes our cool and fresh retreat--
713,THE WOOD.,These fragrant limes between.
714,THE WOOD.,
715,THE WOOD.,"That sunset! Look beneath the boughs,"
716,THE WOOD.,Over the copse--beyond the hills;
717,THE WOOD.,"How soft, yet deep and warm it glows,"
718,THE WOOD.,And heaven with rich suffusion fills;
719,THE WOOD.,"With hues where still the opal's tint,"
720,THE WOOD.,"Its gleam of prisoned fire is blent,"
721,THE WOOD.,Where flame through azure thrills!
722,THE WOOD.,
723,THE WOOD.,Depart we now--for fast will fade
724,THE WOOD.,"That solemn splendour of decline,"
725,THE WOOD.,And deep must be the after-shade
726,THE WOOD.,As stars alone to-night will shine;
727,THE WOOD.,No moon is destined--pale--to gaze
728,THE WOOD.,"On such a day's vast Phoenix blaze,"
729,THE WOOD.,A day in fires decayed!
730,THE WOOD.,
731,THE WOOD.,There--hand-in-hand we tread again
732,THE WOOD.,"The mazes of this varying wood,"
733,THE WOOD.,"And soon, amid a cultured plain,"
734,THE WOOD.,"Girt in with fertile solitude,"
735,THE WOOD.,"We shall our resting-place descry,"
736,THE WOOD.,"Marked by one roof-tree, towering high"
737,THE WOOD.,Above a farmstead rude.
738,THE WOOD.,
739,THE WOOD.,"Refreshed, erelong, with rustic fare,"
740,THE WOOD.,We'll seek a couch of dreamless ease;
741,THE WOOD.,"Courage will guard thy heart from fear,"
742,THE WOOD.,And Love give mine divinest peace:
743,THE WOOD.,"To-morrow brings more dangerous toil,"
744,THE WOOD.,And through its conflict and turmoil
745,THE WOOD.,"We'll pass, as God shall please."
746,THE WOOD.,
747,THE WOOD.,"[The preceding composition refers, doubtless, to the scenes"
748,THE WOOD.,acted in France during the last year of the Consulate.]

753,FRANCES.,FRANCES.
754,FRANCES.,
755,FRANCES.,"She will not sleep, for fear of dreams,"
756,FRANCES.,"But, rising, quits her restless bed,"
757,FRANCES.,And walks where some beclouded beams
758,FRANCES.,Of moonlight through the hall are shed.
759,FRANCES.,
760,FRANCES.,"Obedient to the goad of grief,"
761,FRANCES.,"Her steps, now fast, now lingering slow,"
762,FRANCES.,In varying motion seek relief
763,FRANCES.,From the Eumenides of woe.
764,FRANCES.,
765,FRANCES.,"Wringing her hands, at intervals--"
766,FRANCES.,But long as mute as phantom dim--
767,FRANCES.,"She glides along the dusky walls,"
768,FRANCES.,Under the black oak rafters grim.
769,FRANCES.,
770,FRANCES.,The close air of the grated tower
771,FRANCES.,"Stifles a heart that scarce can beat,"
772,FRANCES.,"And, though so late and lone the hour,"
773,FRANCES.,"Forth pass her wandering, faltering feet;"
774,FRANCES.,
775,FRANCES.,And on the pavement spread before
776,FRANCES.,"The long front of the mansion grey,"
777,FRANCES.,"Her steps imprint the night-frost hoar,"
778,FRANCES.,Which pale on grass and granite lay.
779,FRANCES.,
780,FRANCES.,Not long she stayed where misty moon
781,FRANCES.,"And shimmering stars could on her look,"
782,FRANCES.,But through the garden archway soon
783,FRANCES.,Her strange and gloomy path she took.
784,FRANCES.,
785,FRANCES.,"Some firs, coeval with the tower,"
786,FRANCES.,Their straight black boughs stretched o'er her head;
787,FRANCES.,"Unseen, beneath this sable bower,"
788,FRANCES.,Rustled her dress and rapid tread.
789,FRANCES.,
790,FRANCES.,"There was an alcove in that shade,"
791,FRANCES.,Screening a rustic seat and stand;
792,FRANCES.,"Weary she sat her down, and laid"
793,FRANCES.,Her hot brow on her burning hand.
794,FRANCES.,
795,FRANCES.,"To solitude and to the night,"
796,FRANCES.,"Some words she now, in murmurs, said;"
797,FRANCES.,"And trickling through her fingers white,"
798,FRANCES.,Some tears of misery she shed.
799,FRANCES.,
800,FRANCES.,"""God help me in my grievous need,"
801,FRANCES.,God help me in my inward pain;
802,FRANCES.,"Which cannot ask for pity's meed,"
803,FRANCES.,"Which has no licence to complain,"
804,FRANCES.,
805,FRANCES.,"""Which must be borne; yet who can bear,"
806,FRANCES.,"Hours long, days long, a constant weight--"
807,FRANCES.,"The yoke of absolute despair,"
808,FRANCES.,A suffering wholly desolate?
809,FRANCES.,
810,FRANCES.,"""Who can for ever crush the heart,"
811,FRANCES.,"Restrain its throbbing, curb its life?"
812,FRANCES.,"Dissemble truth with ceaseless art,"
813,FRANCES.,"With outward calm mask inward strife?"""
814,FRANCES.,
815,FRANCES.,She waited--as for some reply;
816,FRANCES.,The still and cloudy night gave none;
817,FRANCES.,"Ere long, with deep-drawn, trembling sigh,"
818,FRANCES.,Her heavy plaint again begun.
819,FRANCES.,
820,FRANCES.,"""Unloved--I love; unwept--I weep;"
821,FRANCES.,Grief I restrain--hope I repress:
822,FRANCES.,Vain is this anguish--fixed and deep;
823,FRANCES.,"Vainer, desires and dreams of bliss."
824,FRANCES.,
825,FRANCES.,"""My love awakes no love again,"
826,FRANCES.,"My tears collect, and fall unfelt;"
827,FRANCES.,"My sorrow touches none with pain,"
828,FRANCES.,My humble hopes to nothing melt.
829,FRANCES.,
830,FRANCES.,"""For me the universe is dumb,"
831,FRANCES.,"Stone-deaf, and blank, and wholly blind;"
832,FRANCES.,"Life I must bound, existence sum"
833,FRANCES.,In the strait limits of one mind;
834,FRANCES.,
835,FRANCES.,"""That mind my own. Oh! narrow cell;"
836,FRANCES.,Dark--imageless--a living tomb!
837,FRANCES.,"There must I sleep, there wake and dwell"
838,FRANCES.,"Content, with palsy, pain, and gloom."""
839,FRANCES.,
840,FRANCES.,"Again she paused; a moan of pain,"
841,FRANCES.,"A stifled sob, alone was heard;"
842,FRANCES.,Long silence followed--then again
843,FRANCES.,Her voice the stagnant midnight stirred.
844,FRANCES.,
845,FRANCES.,"""Must it be so? Is this my fate?"
846,FRANCES.,"Can I nor struggle, nor contend?"
847,FRANCES.,"And am I doomed for years to wait,"
848,FRANCES.,Watching death's lingering axe descend?
849,FRANCES.,
850,FRANCES.,"""And when it falls, and when I die,"
851,FRANCES.,What follows? Vacant nothingness?
852,FRANCES.,The blank of lost identity?
853,FRANCES.,Erasure both of pain and bliss?
854,FRANCES.,
855,FRANCES.,"""I've heard of heaven--I would believe;"
856,FRANCES.,"For if this earth indeed be all,"
857,FRANCES.,Who longest lives may deepest grieve;
858,FRANCES.,"Most blest, whom sorrows soonest call."
859,FRANCES.,

861,FRANCES.,Will man find hope on yonder coast?
862,FRANCES.,"Hope, which, on earth, shines never clear,"

905,FRANCES.,"""And when thy opening eyes shall see"

907,FRANCES.,"Of one who has forgotten thee,"
908,FRANCES.,Shed not the tear of acrid gall.
909,FRANCES.,
910,FRANCES.,"""The tear which, welling from the heart,"

912,FRANCES.,"And makes each nerve, in torture, start,"
913,FRANCES.,At feelings it too well recalls:
914,FRANCES.,
915,FRANCES.,"""When the sweet hope of being loved"
916,FRANCES.,Threw Eden sunshine on life's way:
917,FRANCES.,When every sense and feeling proved
918,FRANCES.,Expectancy of brightest day.
919,FRANCES.,
920,FRANCES.,"""When the hand trembled to receive"
921,FRANCES.,"A thrilling clasp, which seemed so near,"
922,FRANCES.,And the heart ventured to believe
923,FRANCES.,Another heart esteemed it dear.
924,FRANCES.,
925,FRANCES.,"""When words, half love, all tenderness,"
926,FRANCES.,"Were hourly heard, as hourly spoken,"
927,FRANCES.,"When the long, sunny days of bliss"
928,FRANCES.,Only by moonlight nights were broken.
929,FRANCES.,
930,FRANCES.,"""Till, drop by drop, the cup of joy"
931,FRANCES.,"Filled full, with purple light was glowing,"
932,FRANCES.,"And Faith, which watched it, sparkling high"
933,FRANCES.,Still never dreamt the overflowing.
934,FRANCES.,
935,FRANCES.,"""It fell not with a sudden crashing,"
936,FRANCES.,It poured not out like open sluice;
937,FRANCES.,"No, sparkling still, and redly flashing,"
938,FRANCES.,"Drained, drop by drop, the generous juice."
939,FRANCES.,
940,FRANCES.,"""I saw it sink, and strove to taste it,"
941,FRANCES.,My eager lips approached the brim;

943,FRANCES.,"It sank to dregs, all harsh and dim."
944,FRANCES.,
945,FRANCES.,"""These I have drunk, and they for ever"

947,FRANCES.,A draught from Sodom's lake could never
948,FRANCES.,"More fiery, salt, and bitter, be."
949,FRANCES.,
950,FRANCES.,"""Oh! Love was all a thin illusion"
951,FRANCES.,"Joy, but the desert's flying stream;"
952,FRANCES.,"And glancing back on long delusion,"
953,FRANCES.,My memory grasps a hollow dream.
954,FRANCES.,
955,FRANCES.,"""Yet whence that wondrous change of feeling,"
956,FRANCES.,"I never knew, and cannot learn;"
957,FRANCES.,"Nor why my lover's eye, congealing,"
958,FRANCES.,"Grew cold and clouded, proud and stern."
959,FRANCES.,
960,FRANCES.,"""Nor wherefore, friendship's forms forgetting,"
961,FRANCES.,"He careless left, and cool withdrew;"
962,FRANCES.,"Nor spoke of grief, nor fond regretting,"
963,FRANCES.,Nor ev'n one glance of comfort threw.
964,FRANCES.,
965,FRANCES.,"""And neither word nor token sending,"
966,FRANCES.,"Of kindness, since the parting day,"
967,FRANCES.,"His course, for distant regions bending,"
968,FRANCES.,"Went, self-contained and calm, away."
969,FRANCES.,
970,FRANCES.,"""Oh, bitter, blighting, keen sensation,"
971,FRANCES.,"Which will not weaken, cannot die,"
972,FRANCES.,"Hasten thy work of desolation,"
973,FRANCES.,And let my tortured spirit fly!
974,FRANCES.,
975,FRANCES.,"""Vain as the passing gale, my crying;"
976,FRANCES.,"Though lightning-struck, I must live on;"
977,FRANCES.,"I know, at heart, there is no dying"
978,FRANCES.,"Of love, and ruined hope, alone."
979,FRANCES.,
980,FRANCES.,"""Still strong and young, and warm with vigour,"
981,FRANCES.,"Though scathed, I long shall greenly grow;"
982,FRANCES.,And many a storm of wildest rigour
983,FRANCES.,Shall yet break o'er my shivered bough.
984,FRANCES.,
985,FRANCES.,"""Rebellious now to blank inertion,"
986,FRANCES.,My unused strength demands a task;
987,FRANCES.,"Travel, and toil, and full exertion,"
988,FRANCES.,"Are the last, only boon I ask."
989,FRANCES.,
990,FRANCES.,"""Whence, then, this vain and barren dreaming"
991,FRANCES.,"Of death, and dubious life to come?"
992,FRANCES.,I see a nearer beacon gleaming
993,FRANCES.,Over dejection's sea of gloom.
994,FRANCES.,
995,FRANCES.,"""The very wildness of my sorrow"
996,FRANCES.,Tells me I yet have innate force;
997,FRANCES.,"My track of life has been too narrow,"
998,FRANCES.,Effort shall trace a broader course.
999,FRANCES.,
1000,FRANCES.,"""The world is not in yonder tower,"
1001,FRANCES.,"Earth is not prisoned in that room,"
1002,FRANCES.,"'Mid whose dark panels, hour by hour,"
1003,FRANCES.,"I've sat, the slave and prey of gloom."
1004,FRANCES.,
1005,FRANCES.,"""One feeling--turned to utter anguish,"
1006,FRANCES.,Is not my being's only aim;
1007,FRANCES.,"When, lorn and loveless, life will languish,"
1008,FRANCES.,But courage can revive the flame.
1009,FRANCES.,
1010,FRANCES.,"""He, when he left me, went a roving"
1011,FRANCES.,"To sunny climes, beyond the sea;"
1012,FRANCES.,"And I, the weight of woe removing,"
1013,FRANCES.,Am free and fetterless as he.
1014,FRANCES.,
1015,FRANCES.,"""New scenes, new language, skies less clouded,"
1016,FRANCES.,May once more wake the wish to live;
1017,FRANCES.,"Strange, foreign towns, astir, and crowded,"
1018,FRANCES.,New pictures to the mind may give.
1019,FRANCES.,
1020,FRANCES.,"""New forms and faces, passing ever,"

1025,FRANCES.,"""And we might meet--time may have changed him;"
1026,FRANCES.,"Chance may reveal the mystery,"
1027,FRANCES.,The secret influence which estranged him;
1028,FRANCES.,Love may restore him yet to me.
1029,FRANCES.,
1030,FRANCES.,"""False thought--false hope--in scorn be banished!"
1031,FRANCES.,I am not loved--nor loved have been;

1034,FRANCES.,
1035,FRANCES.,"""To words like yours I bid defiance,"
1036,FRANCES.,'Tis such my mental wreck have made;

1049,GILBERT.,
1050,I. THE GARDEN.,I. THE GARDEN.
1051,I. THE GARDEN.,
1052,I. THE GARDEN.,"Above the city hung the moon,"
1053,I. THE GARDEN.,Right o'er a plot of ground
1054,I. THE GARDEN.,Where flowers and orchard-trees were fenced
1055,I. THE GARDEN.,With lofty walls around:
1056,I. THE GARDEN.,'Twas Gilbert's garden--there to-night
1057,I. THE GARDEN.,Awhile he walked alone;
1058,I. THE GARDEN.,"And, tired with sedentary toil,"
1059,I. THE GARDEN.,Mused where the moonlight shone.
1060,I. THE GARDEN.,
1061,I. THE GARDEN.,"This garden, in a city-heart,"
1062,I. THE GARDEN.,"Lay still as houseless wild,"
1063,I. THE GARDEN.,Though many-windowed mansion fronts
1064,I. THE GARDEN.,Were round it; closely piled;
1065,I. THE GARDEN.,"But thick their walls, and those within"
1066,I. THE GARDEN.,Lived lives by noise unstirred;
1067,I. THE GARDEN.,"Like wafting of an angel's wing,"
1068,I. THE GARDEN.,Time's flight by them was heard.
1069,I. THE GARDEN.,
1070,I. THE GARDEN.,Some soft piano-notes alone
1071,I. THE GARDEN.,"Were sweet as faintly given,"
1072,I. THE GARDEN.,"Where ladies, doubtless, cheered the hearth"
1073,I. THE GARDEN.,With song that winter-even.
1074,I. THE GARDEN.,The city's many-mingled sounds
1075,I. THE GARDEN.,Rose like the hum of ocean;
1076,I. THE GARDEN.,They rather lulled the heart than roused
1077,I. THE GARDEN.,Its pulse to faster motion.
1078,I. THE GARDEN.,
1079,I. THE GARDEN.,Gilbert has paced the single walk
1080,I. THE GARDEN.,"An hour, yet is not weary;"
1081,I. THE GARDEN.,"And, though it be a winter night"
1082,I. THE GARDEN.,He feels nor cold nor dreary.
1083,I. THE GARDEN.,"The prime of life is in his veins,"
1084,I. THE GARDEN.,"And sends his blood fast flowing,"
1085,I. THE GARDEN.,And Fancy's fervour warms the thoughts
1086,I. THE GARDEN.,Now in his bosom glowing.
1087,I. THE GARDEN.,
1088,I. THE GARDEN.,"Those thoughts recur to early love,"
1089,I. THE GARDEN.,"Or what he love would name,"
1090,I. THE GARDEN.,Though haply Gilbert's secret deeds
1091,I. THE GARDEN.,Might other title claim.
1092,I. THE GARDEN.,"Such theme not oft his mind absorbs,"
1093,I. THE GARDEN.,"He to the world clings fast,"
1094,I. THE GARDEN.,"And too much for the present lives,"
1095,I. THE GARDEN.,To linger o'er the past.
1096,I. THE GARDEN.,
1097,I. THE GARDEN.,But now the evening's deep repose
1098,I. THE GARDEN.,Has glided to his soul;
1099,I. THE GARDEN.,"That moonlight falls on Memory,"
1100,I. THE GARDEN.,And shows her fading scroll.
1101,I. THE GARDEN.,One name appears in every line
1102,I. THE GARDEN.,"The gentle rays shine o'er,"
1103,I. THE GARDEN.,And still he smiles and still repeats
1104,I. THE GARDEN.,That one name--Elinor.
1105,I. THE GARDEN.,
1106,I. THE GARDEN.,"There is no sorrow in his smile,"
1107,I. THE GARDEN.,No kindness in his tone;
1108,I. THE GARDEN.,The triumph of a selfish heart
1109,I. THE GARDEN.,Speaks coldly there alone;
1110,I. THE GARDEN.,"He says: ""She loved me more than life;"
1111,I. THE GARDEN.,And truly it was sweet
1112,I. THE GARDEN.,"To see so fair a woman kneel,"
1113,I. THE GARDEN.,"In bondage, at my feet."
1114,I. THE GARDEN.,
1115,I. THE GARDEN.,"""There was a sort of quiet bliss"
1116,I. THE GARDEN.,"To be so deeply loved,"
1117,I. THE GARDEN.,To gaze on trembling eagerness
1118,I. THE GARDEN.,And sit myself unmoved.
1119,I. THE GARDEN.,And when it pleased my pride to grant
1120,I. THE GARDEN.,"At last some rare caress,"
1121,I. THE GARDEN.,To feel the fever of that hand
1122,I. THE GARDEN.,My fingers deigned to press.
1123,I. THE GARDEN.,
1124,I. THE GARDEN.,"""'Twas sweet to see her strive to hide"
1125,I. THE GARDEN.,What every glance revealed;
1126,I. THE GARDEN.,"Endowed, the while, with despot-might"
1127,I. THE GARDEN.,Her destiny to wield.
1128,I. THE GARDEN.,"I knew myself no perfect man,"
1129,I. THE GARDEN.,"Nor, as she deemed, divine;"
1130,I. THE GARDEN.,I knew that I was glorious--but
1131,I. THE GARDEN.,By her reflected shine;
1132,I. THE GARDEN.,
1133,I. THE GARDEN.,"""Her youth, her native energy,"
1134,I. THE GARDEN.,"Her powers new-born and fresh,"
1135,I. THE GARDEN.,'Twas these with Godhead sanctified
1136,I. THE GARDEN.,My sensual frame of flesh.
1137,I. THE GARDEN.,"Yet, like a god did I descend"
1138,I. THE GARDEN.,"At last, to meet her love;"
1139,I. THE GARDEN.,"And, like a god, I then withdrew"
1140,I. THE GARDEN.,To my own heaven above.
1141,I. THE GARDEN.,
1142,I. THE GARDEN.,"""And never more could she invoke"
1143,I. THE GARDEN.,My presence to her sphere;
1144,I. THE GARDEN.,"No prayer, no plaint, no cry of hers"
1145,I. THE GARDEN.,Could win my awful ear.
1146,I. THE GARDEN.,I knew her blinded constancy
1147,I. THE GARDEN.,"Would ne'er my deeds betray,"
1148,I. THE GARDEN.,"And, calm in conscience, whole in heart."
1149,I. THE GARDEN.,I went my tranquil way.
1150,I. THE GARDEN.,
1151,I. THE GARDEN.,"""Yet, sometimes, I still feel a wish,"
1152,I. THE GARDEN.,The fond and flattering pain
1153,I. THE GARDEN.,Of passion's anguish to create
1154,I. THE GARDEN.,In her young breast again.
1155,I. THE GARDEN.,"Bright was the lustre of her eyes,"
1156,I. THE GARDEN.,When they caught fire from mine;
1157,I. THE GARDEN.,"If I had power--this very hour,"
1158,I. THE GARDEN.,Again I'd light their shine.
1159,I. THE GARDEN.,
1160,I. THE GARDEN.,"""But where she is, or how she lives,"
1161,I. THE GARDEN.,I have no clue to know;
1162,I. THE GARDEN.,"I've heard she long my absence pined,"
1163,I. THE GARDEN.,And left her home in woe.
1164,I. THE GARDEN.,"But busied, then, in gathering gold,"
1165,I. THE GARDEN.,"As I am busied now,"
1166,I. THE GARDEN.,"I could not turn from such pursuit,"
1167,I. THE GARDEN.,To weep a broken vow.
1168,I. THE GARDEN.,
1169,I. THE GARDEN.,"""Nor could I give to fatal risk"
1170,I. THE GARDEN.,The fame I ever prized;
1171,I. THE GARDEN.,"Even now, I fear, that precious fame"
1172,I. THE GARDEN.,"Is too much compromised."""
1173,I. THE GARDEN.,"An inward trouble dims his eye,"
1174,I. THE GARDEN.,Some riddle he would solve;
1175,I. THE GARDEN.,"Some method to unloose a knot,"
1176,I. THE GARDEN.,His anxious thoughts revolve.
1177,I. THE GARDEN.,
1178,I. THE GARDEN.,"He, pensive, leans against a tree,"
1179,I. THE GARDEN.,"A leafy evergreen,"
1180,I. THE GARDEN.,"The boughs, the moonlight, intercept,"
1181,I. THE GARDEN.,And hide him like a screen
1182,I. THE GARDEN.,"He starts--the tree shakes with his tremor,"
1183,I. THE GARDEN.,Yet nothing near him pass'd;
1184,I. THE GARDEN.,"He hurries up the garden alley,"
1185,I. THE GARDEN.,In strangely sudden haste.
1186,I. THE GARDEN.,
1187,I. THE GARDEN.,"With shaking hand, he lifts the latchet,"
1188,I. THE GARDEN.,Steps o'er the threshold stone;
1189,I. THE GARDEN.,The heavy door slips from his fingers--
1190,I. THE GARDEN.,"It shuts, and he is gone."
1191,I. THE GARDEN.,"What touched, transfixed, appalled, his soul?--"
1192,I. THE GARDEN.,"A nervous thought, no more;"

1292,II. THE PARLOUR.,No voice in that wild riot.
1293,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Sustain'd and strong, a wondrous blast"
1294,II. THE PARLOUR.,Above and round him blows;
1295,II. THE PARLOUR.,"A greenish gloom, dense overcast,"
1296,II. THE PARLOUR.,Each moment denser grows.
1297,II. THE PARLOUR.,
1298,II. THE PARLOUR.,"He nothing knows--nor clearly sees,"
1299,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Resistance checks his breath,"
1300,II. THE PARLOUR.,"The high, impetuous, ceaseless breeze"
1301,II. THE PARLOUR.,Blows on him cold as death.
1302,II. THE PARLOUR.,And still the undulating gloom
1303,II. THE PARLOUR.,Mocks sight with formless motion:
1304,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Was such sensation Jonah's doom,"
1305,II. THE PARLOUR.,Gulphed in the depths of ocean?
1306,II. THE PARLOUR.,
1307,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Streaking the air, the nameless vision,"
1308,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Fast-driven, deep-sounding, flows;"
1309,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Oh! whence its source, and what its mission?"
1310,II. THE PARLOUR.,How will its terrors close?
1311,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Long-sweeping, rushing, vast and void,"
1312,II. THE PARLOUR.,The universe it swallows;
1313,II. THE PARLOUR.,"And still the dark, devouring tide"
1314,II. THE PARLOUR.,A typhoon tempest follows.
1315,II. THE PARLOUR.,
1316,II. THE PARLOUR.,More slow it rolls; its furious race
1317,II. THE PARLOUR.,Sinks to its solemn gliding;
1318,II. THE PARLOUR.,"The stunning roar, the wind's wild chase,"
1319,II. THE PARLOUR.,To stillness are subsiding.
1320,II. THE PARLOUR.,"And, slowly borne along, a form"
1321,II. THE PARLOUR.,The shapeless chaos varies;
1322,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Poised in the eddy to the storm,"
1323,II. THE PARLOUR.,Before the eye it tarries.
1324,II. THE PARLOUR.,
1325,II. THE PARLOUR.,"A woman drowned--sunk in the deep,"
1326,II. THE PARLOUR.,On a long wave reclining;
1327,II. THE PARLOUR.,"The circling waters' crystal sweep,"
1328,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Like glass, her shape enshrining."
1329,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Her pale dead face, to Gilbert turned,"
1330,II. THE PARLOUR.,Seems as in sleep reposing;
1331,II. THE PARLOUR.,"A feeble light, now first discerned,"
1332,II. THE PARLOUR.,The features well disclosing.
1333,II. THE PARLOUR.,
1334,II. THE PARLOUR.,No effort from the haunted air
1335,II. THE PARLOUR.,"The ghastly scene could banish,"
1336,II. THE PARLOUR.,"That hovering wave, arrested there,"
1337,II. THE PARLOUR.,Rolled--throbbed--but did not vanish.
1338,II. THE PARLOUR.,"If Gilbert upward turned his gaze,"
1339,II. THE PARLOUR.,He saw the ocean-shadow;
1340,II. THE PARLOUR.,"If he looked down, the endless seas"
1341,II. THE PARLOUR.,Lay green as summer meadow.
1342,II. THE PARLOUR.,
1343,II. THE PARLOUR.,"And straight before, the pale corpse lay,"
1344,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Upborne by air or billow,"
1345,II. THE PARLOUR.,"So near, he could have touched the spray"
1346,II. THE PARLOUR.,That churned around its pillow.
1347,II. THE PARLOUR.,The hollow anguish of the face
1348,II. THE PARLOUR.,Had moved a fiend to sorrow;
1349,II. THE PARLOUR.,Not death's fixed calm could rase the trace
1350,II. THE PARLOUR.,Of suffering's deep-worn furrow.
1351,II. THE PARLOUR.,
1352,II. THE PARLOUR.,"All moved; a strong returning blast,"
1353,II. THE PARLOUR.,"The mass of waters raising,"
1354,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Bore wave and passive carcase past,"
1355,II. THE PARLOUR.,While Gilbert yet was gazing.
1356,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Deep in her isle-conceiving womb,"
1357,II. THE PARLOUR.,"It seemed the ocean thundered,"
1358,II. THE PARLOUR.,"And soon, by realms of rushing gloom,"
1359,II. THE PARLOUR.,Were seer and phantom sundered.
1360,II. THE PARLOUR.,
1361,II. THE PARLOUR.,Then swept some timbers from a wreck.
1362,II. THE PARLOUR.,On following surges riding;
1363,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Then sea-weed, in the turbid rack"
1364,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Uptorn, went slowly gliding."
1365,II. THE PARLOUR.,"The horrid shade, by slow degrees,"
1366,II. THE PARLOUR.,"A beam of light defeated,"
1367,II. THE PARLOUR.,"And then the roar of raving seas,"
1368,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Fast, far, and faint, retreated."
1369,II. THE PARLOUR.,
1370,II. THE PARLOUR.,"And all was gone--gone like a mist,"
1371,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Corse, billows, tempest, wreck;"
1372,II. THE PARLOUR.,Three children close to Gilbert prest
1373,II. THE PARLOUR.,And clung around his neck.
1374,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Good night! good night! the prattlers said,"
1375,II. THE PARLOUR.,And kissed their father's cheek;
1376,II. THE PARLOUR.,'Twas now the hour their quiet bed
1377,II. THE PARLOUR.,And placid rest to seek.
1378,II. THE PARLOUR.,
1379,II. THE PARLOUR.,The mother with her offspring goes
1380,II. THE PARLOUR.,To hear their evening prayer;
1381,II. THE PARLOUR.,"She nought of Gilbert's vision knows,"
1382,II. THE PARLOUR.,And nought of his despair.
1383,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Yet, pitying God, abridge the time"
1384,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Of anguish, now his fate!"
1385,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Though, haply, great has been his crime:"
1386,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Thy mercy, too, is great."
1387,II. THE PARLOUR.,
1388,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Gilbert, at length, uplifts his head,"
1389,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Bent for some moments low,"
1390,II. THE PARLOUR.,And there is neither grief nor dread
1391,II. THE PARLOUR.,Upon his subtle brow.
1392,II. THE PARLOUR.,"For well can he his feelings task,"
1393,II. THE PARLOUR.,And well his looks command;
1394,II. THE PARLOUR.,"His features well his heart can mask,"
1395,II. THE PARLOUR.,With smiles and smoothness bland.
1396,II. THE PARLOUR.,
1397,II. THE PARLOUR.,Gilbert has reasoned with his mind--
1398,II. THE PARLOUR.,He says 'twas all a dream;
1399,II. THE PARLOUR.,He strives his inward sight to blind
1400,II. THE PARLOUR.,Against truth's inward beam.
1401,II. THE PARLOUR.,"He pitied not that shadowy thing,"
1402,II. THE PARLOUR.,When it was flesh and blood;
1403,II. THE PARLOUR.,Nor now can pity's balmy spring
1404,II. THE PARLOUR.,Refresh his arid mood.
1405,II. THE PARLOUR.,
1406,II. THE PARLOUR.,"""And if that dream has spoken truth,"""
1407,II. THE PARLOUR.,Thus musingly he says;
1408,II. THE PARLOUR.,"""If Elinor be dead, in sooth,"
1409,II. THE PARLOUR.,Such chance the shock repays:
1410,II. THE PARLOUR.,"A net was woven round my feet,"
1411,II. THE PARLOUR.,I scarce could further go;
1412,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Ere shame had forced a fast retreat,"
1413,II. THE PARLOUR.,Dishonour brought me low.
1414,II. THE PARLOUR.,
1415,II. THE PARLOUR.,"""Conceal her, then, deep, silent sea,"
1416,II. THE PARLOUR.,Give her a secret grave!
1417,II. THE PARLOUR.,"She sleeps in peace, and I am free,"
1418,II. THE PARLOUR.,No longer terror's slave:
1419,II. THE PARLOUR.,"And homage still, from all the world,"
1420,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Shall greet my spotless name,"
1421,II. THE PARLOUR.,Since surges break and waves are curled
1422,II. THE PARLOUR.,"Above its threatened shame."""

1430,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,To-night comes home again.
1431,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"Ten years have passed above his head,"
1432,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Each year has brought him gain;
1433,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"His prosperous life has smoothly sped,"
1434,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Without or tear or stain.
1435,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,
1436,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,'Tis somewhat late--the city clocks
1437,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"Twelve deep vibrations toll,"
1438,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"As Gilbert at the portal knocks,"
1439,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Which is his journey's goal.
1440,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"The street is still and desolate,"
1441,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,The moon hid by a cloud;
1442,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"Gilbert, impatient, will not wait,--"
1443,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,His second knock peals loud.
1444,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,
1445,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,The clocks are hushed--there's not a light
1446,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"In any window nigh,"
1447,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,And not a single planet bright
1448,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Looks from the clouded sky;
1449,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"The air is raw, the rain descends,"
1450,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,A bitter north-wind blows;
1451,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,His cloak the traveller scarce defends--
1452,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Will not the door unclose?
1453,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,
1454,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"He knocks the third time, and the last"
1455,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"His summons now they hear,"
1456,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"Within, a footstep, hurrying fast,"
1457,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Is heard approaching near.
1458,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"The bolt is drawn, the clanking chain"
1459,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Falls to the floor of stone;
1460,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,And Gilbert to his heart will strain
1461,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,His wife and children soon.
1462,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,
1463,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"The hand that lifts the latchet, holds"
1464,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"A candle to his sight,"
1465,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"And Gilbert, on the step, beholds"
1466,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"A woman, clad in white."
1467,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Lo! water from her dripping dress
1468,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Runs on the streaming floor;
1469,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,From every dark and clinging tress
1470,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,The drops incessant pour.
1471,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,
1472,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,There's none but her to welcome him;
1473,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"She holds the candle high,"
1474,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"And, motionless in form and limb,"
1475,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Stands cold and silent nigh;
1476,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"There's sand and sea-weed on her robe,"
1477,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Her hollow eyes are blind;
1478,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"No pulse in such a frame can throb,"
1479,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,No life is there defined.
1480,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,
1481,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"Gilbert turned ashy-white, but still"
1482,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,His lips vouchsafed no cry;
1483,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,He spurred his strength and master-will
1484,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"To pass the figure by,--"
1485,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"But, moving slow, it faced him straight,"
1486,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,It would not flinch nor quail:
1487,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"Then first did Gilbert's strength abate,"
1488,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,His stony firmness quail.
1489,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,
1490,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,He sank upon his knees and prayed
1491,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,The shape stood rigid there;
1492,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"He called aloud for human aid,"
1493,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,No human aid was near.
1494,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,An accent strange did thus repeat
1495,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Heaven's stern but just decree:
1496,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"""The measure thou to her didst mete,"

1499,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"Gilbert sprang from his bended knees,"
1500,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"By the pale spectre pushed,"
1501,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"And, wild as one whom demons seize,"
1502,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Up the hall-staircase rushed;
1503,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Entered his chamber--near the bed
1504,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Sheathed steel and fire-arms hung--
1505,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Impelled by maniac purpose dread
1506,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,He chose those stores among.
1507,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,
1508,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Across his throat a keen-edged knife
1509,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,With vigorous hand he drew;
1510,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,The wound was wide--his outraged life
1511,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,Rushed rash and redly through.
1512,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"And thus died, by a shameful death,"
1513,III. THE WELCOME HOME.,"A wise and worldly man,"

4818,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"At that period she was sent to school. Her previous life, with the"

4823,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"in little valleys, where a stream waters, here and there, a fringe of"
4824,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,stunted copse. Mills and scattered cottages chase romance from these

4827,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"finds it there, she must be a solitude-loving raven--no gentle dove. If"
4828,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"she demand beauty to inspire her, she must bring it inborn: these moors"

4841,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,My sister Emily loved the moors. Flowers brighter than the rose bloomed
4842,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,in the blackest of the heath for her; out of a sullen hollow in a livid
4843,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,hill-side her mind could make an Eden. She found in the bleak solitude
4844,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,many and dear delights; and not the least and best loved was--liberty.

4850,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"auspices), was what she failed in enduring. Her nature proved here too"
4851,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"strong for her fortitude. Every morning when she woke, the vision of"
4852,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"home and the moors rushed on her, and darkened and saddened the day that"
4853,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,lay before her. Nobody knew what ailed her but me--I knew only too well.
4854,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"In this struggle her health was quickly broken: her white face,"
4855,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"attenuated form, and failing strength, threatened rapid decline. I felt"
4856,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"in my heart she would die, if she did not go home, and with this"
4857,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,conviction obtained her recall. She had only been three months at
4858,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,school; and it was some years before the experiment of sending her from
4859,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"home was again ventured on. After the age of twenty, having meantime"
4860,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"studied alone with diligence and perseverance, she went with me to an"
4861,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"establishment on the Continent: the same suffering and conflict ensued,"
4862,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"heightened by the strong recoil of her upright, heretic and English"
4863,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,spirit from the gentle Jesuitry of the foreign and Romish system. Once
4864,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"more she seemed sinking, but this time she rallied through the mere"
4865,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,force of resolution: with inward remorse and shame she looked back on
4866,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"her former failure, and resolved to conquer in this second ordeal. She"
4867,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,did conquer: but the victory cost her dear. She was never happy till she
4868,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"carried her hard-won knowledge back to the remote English village, the"
4869,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"old parsonage-house, and desolate Yorkshire hills. A very few years"
4870,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"more, and she looked her last on those hills, and breathed her last in"
4871,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,"that house, and under the aisle of that obscure village church found her"
4872,SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL.,last lowly resting-place. Merciful was the decree that spared her when

5913,THE NARROW WAY.,But he who seeks that blest abode
5914,THE NARROW WAY.,Must all his powers employ.
5915,THE NARROW WAY.,
5916,THE NARROW WAY.,Bright hopes and pure delight
5917,THE NARROW WAY.,"Upon his course may beam,"
5918,THE NARROW WAY.,"And there, amid the sternest heights,"
5919,THE NARROW WAY.,The sweetest flowerets gleam.
5920,THE NARROW WAY.,
5921,THE NARROW WAY.,"On all her breezes borne,"
5922,THE NARROW WAY.,Earth yields no scents like those;
5923,THE NARROW WAY.,But he that dares not gasp the thorn
5924,THE NARROW WAY.,Should never crave the rose.
5925,THE NARROW WAY.,
5926,THE NARROW WAY.,Arm--arm thee for the fight!
5927,THE NARROW WAY.,Cast useless loads away;
5928,THE NARROW WAY.,Watch through the darkest hours of night;
5929,THE NARROW WAY.,Toil through the hottest day.
5930,THE NARROW WAY.,
5931,THE NARROW WAY.,"Crush pride into the dust,"
5932,THE NARROW WAY.,Or thou must needs be slack;
5933,THE NARROW WAY.,"And trample down rebellious lust,"
5934,THE NARROW WAY.,Or it will hold thee back.
5935,THE NARROW WAY.,
5936,THE NARROW WAY.,Seek not thy honour here;
5937,THE NARROW WAY.,Waive pleasure and renown;
5938,THE NARROW WAY.,"The world's dread scoff undaunted bear,"
5939,THE NARROW WAY.,And face its deadliest frown.
5940,THE NARROW WAY.,
5941,THE NARROW WAY.,"To labour and to love,"
5942,THE NARROW WAY.,"To pardon and endure,"
5943,THE NARROW WAY.,"To lift thy heart to God above,"
5944,THE NARROW WAY.,And keep thy conscience pure;
5945,THE NARROW WAY.,
5946,THE NARROW WAY.,"Be this thy constant aim,"
5947,THE NARROW WAY.,"Thy hope, thy chief delight;"
5948,THE NARROW WAY.,What matter who should whisper blame
5949,THE NARROW WAY.,Or who should scorn or slight?
5950,THE NARROW WAY.,
5951,THE NARROW WAY.,"What matter, if thy God approve,"
5952,THE NARROW WAY.,"And if, within thy breast,"
5953,THE NARROW WAY.,"Thou feel the comfort of His love,"
5954,THE NARROW WAY.,The earnest of His rest?
5955,THE NARROW WAY.,
5956,THE NARROW WAY.,
5957,THE NARROW WAY.,
5958,THE NARROW WAY.,
5959,DOMESTIC PEACE.,DOMESTIC PEACE.
5960,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
5961,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Why should such gloomy silence reign,"
5962,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"And why is all the house so drear,"
5963,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"When neither danger, sickness, pain,"
5964,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Nor death, nor want, have entered here?"
5965,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
5966,DOMESTIC PEACE.,We are as many as we were
5967,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"That other night, when all were gay"
5968,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"And full of hope, and free from care;"
5969,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Yet is there something gone away.
5970,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
5971,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"The moon without, as pure and calm,"
5972,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Is shining as that night she shone;
5973,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"But now, to us, she brings no balm,"
5974,DOMESTIC PEACE.,For something from our hearts is gone.
5975,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
5976,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Something whose absence leaves a void--
5977,DOMESTIC PEACE.,A cheerless want in every heart;
5978,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Each feels the bliss of all destroyed,"
5979,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And mourns the change--but each apart.
5980,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
5981,DOMESTIC PEACE.,The fire is burning in the grate
5982,DOMESTIC PEACE.,As redly as it used to burn;
5983,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"But still the hearth is desolate,"
5984,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Till mirth, and love, and PEACE return."
5985,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
5986,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"'Twas PEACE that flowed from heart to heart,"
5987,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"With looks and smiles that spoke of heaven,"
5988,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And gave us language to impart
5989,DOMESTIC PEACE.,The blissful thoughts itself had given.
5990,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
5991,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Domestic peace! best joy of earth,"
5992,DOMESTIC PEACE.,When shall we all thy value learn?
5993,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"White angel, to our sorrowing hearth,"
5994,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Return--oh, graciously return!"
5995,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
5996,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
5997,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
5998,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
5999,DOMESTIC PEACE.,THE THREE GUIDES. [First published in FRASER'S MAGAZINE.]
6000,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6001,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Spirit of Earth! thy hand is chill:
6002,DOMESTIC PEACE.,I've felt its icy clasp;
6003,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"And, shuddering, I remember still"
6004,DOMESTIC PEACE.,That stony-hearted grasp.
6005,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Thine eye bids love and joy depart:
6006,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Oh, turn its gaze from me!"
6007,DOMESTIC PEACE.,It presses down my shrinking heart;
6008,DOMESTIC PEACE.,I will not walk with thee!
6009,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6010,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"""Wisdom is mine,"" I've heard thee say:"
6011,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"""Beneath my searching eye"
6012,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"All mist and darkness melt away,"
6013,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Phantoms and fables fly.
6014,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Before me truth can stand alone,"
6015,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"The naked, solid truth;"
6016,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"And man matured by worth will own,"
6017,DOMESTIC PEACE.,If I am shunned by youth.
6018,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6019,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"""Firm is my tread, and sure though slow;"
6020,DOMESTIC PEACE.,My footsteps never slide;
6021,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And he that follows me shall know
6022,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"I am the surest guide."""
6023,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Thy boast is vain; but were it true
6024,DOMESTIC PEACE.,That thou couldst safely steer
6025,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Life's rough and devious pathway through,"
6026,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Such guidance I should fear.
6027,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6028,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"How could I bear to walk for aye,"
6029,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"With eyes to earthward prone,"
6030,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"O'er trampled weeds and miry clay,"
6031,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And sand and flinty stone;
6032,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Never the glorious view to greet
6033,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Of hill and dale, and sky;"
6034,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"To see that Nature's charms are sweet,"
6035,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Or feel that Heaven is nigh?
6036,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6037,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"If in my heart arose a spring,"
6038,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"A gush of thought divine,"
6039,DOMESTIC PEACE.,At once stagnation thou wouldst bring
6040,DOMESTIC PEACE.,With that cold touch of thine.
6041,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"If, glancing up, I sought to snatch"
6042,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"But one glimpse of the sky,"
6043,DOMESTIC PEACE.,My baffled gaze would only catch
6044,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Thy heartless, cold grey eye."
6045,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6046,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"If to the breezes wandering near,"
6047,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"I listened eagerly,"
6048,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And deemed an angel's tongue to hear
6049,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"That whispered hope to me,"
6050,DOMESTIC PEACE.,That heavenly music would be drowned
6051,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"In thy harsh, droning voice;"
6052,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Nor inward thought, nor sight, nor sound,"
6053,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Might my sad soul rejoice.
6054,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6055,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Dull is thine ear, unheard by thee"
6056,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"The still, small voice of Heaven;"
6057,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Thine eyes are dim and cannot see
6058,DOMESTIC PEACE.,The helps that God has given.
6059,DOMESTIC PEACE.,There is a bridge o'er every flood
6060,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Which thou canst not perceive;
6061,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"A path through every tangled wood,"
6062,DOMESTIC PEACE.,But thou wilt not believe.
6063,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6064,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Striving to make thy way by force,"
6065,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Toil-spent and bramble-torn,"
6066,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Thou'lt fell the tree that checks thy course,"
6067,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And burst through brier and thorn:
6068,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"And, pausing by the river's side,"
6069,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Poor reasoner! thou wilt deem,"
6070,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"By casting pebbles in its tide,"
6071,DOMESTIC PEACE.,To cross the swelling stream.
6072,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6073,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Right through the flinty rock thou'lt try
6074,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Thy toilsome way to bore,"
6075,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Regardless of the pathway nigh
6076,DOMESTIC PEACE.,That would conduct thee o'er
6077,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Not only art thou, then, unkind,"
6078,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"And freezing cold to me,"
6079,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"But unbelieving, deaf, and blind:"
6080,DOMESTIC PEACE.,I will not walk with thee!
6081,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6082,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Spirit of Pride! thy wings are strong,"
6083,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Thine eyes like lightning shine;
6084,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Ecstatic joys to thee belong,"
6085,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And powers almost divine.
6086,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"But 'tis a false, destructive blaze"
6087,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Within those eyes I see;
6088,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Turn hence their fascinating gaze;
6089,DOMESTIC PEACE.,I will not follow thee.
6090,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6091,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"""Coward and fool!"" thou mayst reply,"
6092,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Walk on the common sod;
6093,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Go, trace with timid foot and eye"
6094,DOMESTIC PEACE.,The steps by others trod.
6095,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"'Tis best the beaten path to keep,"
6096,DOMESTIC PEACE.,The ancient faith to hold;
6097,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"To pasture with thy fellow-sheep,"
6098,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And lie within the fold.
6099,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6100,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"""Cling to the earth, poor grovelling worm;"
6101,DOMESTIC PEACE.,'Tis not for thee to soar
6102,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Against the fury of the storm,"
6103,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Amid the thunder's roar!
6104,DOMESTIC PEACE.,There's glory in that daring strife
6105,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Unknown, undreamt by thee;"
6106,DOMESTIC PEACE.,There's speechless rapture in the life
6107,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Of those who follow me.
6108,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6109,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Yes, I have seen thy votaries oft,"
6110,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Upheld by thee their guide,"
6111,DOMESTIC PEACE.,In strength and courage mount aloft
6112,DOMESTIC PEACE.,The steepy mountain-side;
6113,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"I've seen them stand against the sky,"
6114,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"And gazing from below,"
6115,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Beheld thy lightning in their eye
6116,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Thy triumph on their brow.
6117,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6118,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Oh, I have felt what glory then,"
6119,DOMESTIC PEACE.,What transport must be theirs!
6120,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"So far above their fellow-men,"
6121,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Above their toils and cares;
6122,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Inhaling Nature's purest breath,"
6123,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Her riches round them spread,"
6124,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"The wide expanse of earth beneath,"
6125,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Heaven's glories overhead!
6126,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6127,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"But I have seen them helpless, dash'd"
6128,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Down to a bloody grave,"
6129,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"And still thy ruthless eye has flash'd,"
6130,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Thy strong hand did not save;
6131,DOMESTIC PEACE.,I've seen some o'er the mountain's brow
6132,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Sustain'd awhile by thee,"
6133,DOMESTIC PEACE.,O'er rocks of ice and hills of snow
6134,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Bound fearless, wild, and free."
6135,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6136,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Bold and exultant was their mien,"
6137,DOMESTIC PEACE.,While thou didst cheer them on;
6138,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"But evening fell,--and then, I ween,"
6139,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Their faithless guide was gone.
6140,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Alas! how fared thy favourites then,--"
6141,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Lone, helpless, weary, cold?"
6142,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Did ever wanderer find again
6143,DOMESTIC PEACE.,The path he left of old?
6144,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6145,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Where is their glory, where the pride"
6146,DOMESTIC PEACE.,That swelled their hearts before?
6147,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Where now the courage that defied
6148,DOMESTIC PEACE.,The mightiest tempest's roar?
6149,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"What shall they do when night grows black,"
6150,DOMESTIC PEACE.,When angry storms arise?
6151,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Who now will lead them to the track
6152,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Thou taught'st them to despise?
6153,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6154,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Spirit of Pride, it needs not this"
6155,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"To make me shun thy wiles,"
6156,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Renounce thy triumph and thy bliss,"
6157,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Thy honours and thy smiles!
6158,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Bright as thou art, and bold, and strong,"
6159,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"That fierce glance wins not me,"
6160,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And I abhor thy scoffing tongue--
6161,DOMESTIC PEACE.,I will not follow thee!
6162,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6163,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Spirit of Faith! be thou my guide,"
6164,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"O clasp my hand in thine,"
6165,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And let me never quit thy side;
6166,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Thy comforts are divine!
6167,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Earth calls thee blind, misguided one,--"
6168,DOMESTIC PEACE.,But who can shew like thee
6169,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Forgotten things that have been done,"
6170,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And things that are to be?
6171,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6172,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Secrets conceal'd from Nature's ken,"
6173,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Who like thee can declare?
6174,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Or who like thee to erring men
6175,DOMESTIC PEACE.,God's holy will can bear?
6176,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Pride scorns thee for thy lowly mien,--"
6177,DOMESTIC PEACE.,But who like thee can rise
6178,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Above this toilsome, sordid scene,"
6179,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Beyond the holy skies?
6180,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6181,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Meek is thine eye and soft thy voice,"
6182,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"But wondrous is thy might,"
6183,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"To make the wretched soul rejoice,"
6184,DOMESTIC PEACE.,To give the simple light!
6185,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And still to all that seek thy way
6186,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"This magic power is given,--"
6187,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"E'en while their footsteps press the clay,"
6188,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Their souls ascend to heaven.
6189,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6190,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Danger surrounds them,--pain and woe"
6191,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Their portion here must be,"
6192,DOMESTIC PEACE.,But only they that trust thee know
6193,DOMESTIC PEACE.,What comfort dwells with thee;
6194,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Strength to sustain their drooping pow'rs,"
6195,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"And vigour to defend,--"
6196,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Thou pole-star of my darkest hours
6197,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Affliction's firmest friend!
6198,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6199,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Day does not always mark our way,"
6200,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Night's shadows oft appal,"
6201,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"But lead me, and I cannot stray,--"
6202,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Hold me, I shall not fall;"
6203,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Sustain me, I shall never faint,"
6204,DOMESTIC PEACE.,How rough soe'er may be
6205,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"My upward road,--nor moan, nor plaint"
6206,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Shall mar my trust in thee.
6207,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6208,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Narrow the path by which we go,"
6209,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And oft it turns aside
6210,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"From pleasant meads where roses blow,"
6211,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And peaceful waters glide;
6212,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Where flowery turf lies green and soft,"
6213,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"And gentle gales are sweet,"
6214,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"To where dark mountains frown aloft,"
6215,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Hard rocks distress the feet,--"
6216,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6217,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Deserts beyond lie bleak and bare,"
6218,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And keen winds round us blow;
6219,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"But if thy hand conducts me there,"
6220,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"The way is right, I know."
6221,DOMESTIC PEACE.,I have no wish to turn away;
6222,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"My spirit does not quail,--"
6223,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"How can it while I hear thee say,"
6224,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"""Press forward and prevail!"""
6225,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6226,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Even above the tempest's swell
6227,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"I hear thy voice of love,--"
6228,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Of hope and peace, I hear thee tell,"
6229,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And that blest home above;
6230,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Through pain and death I can rejoice.
6231,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"If but thy strength be mine,--"
6232,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Earth hath no music like thy voice,"
6233,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Life owns no joy like thine!
6234,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6235,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Spirit of Faith, I'll go with thee!"
6236,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Thou, if I hold thee fast,"
6237,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Wilt guide, defend, and strengthen me,"
6238,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And bear me home at last;
6239,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"By thy help all things I can do,"
6240,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"In thy strength all things bear,--"
6241,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Teach me, for thou art just and true,"
6242,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Smile on me, thou art fair!"
6243,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6244,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6245,DOMESTIC PEACE.,I have given the last memento of my sister Emily; this is the last of my
6246,DOMESTIC PEACE.,sister Anne:--
6247,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6248,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6249,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"I hoped, that with the brave and strong,"
6250,DOMESTIC PEACE.,My portioned task might lie;
6251,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"To toil amid the busy throng,"
6252,DOMESTIC PEACE.,With purpose pure and high.
6253,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6254,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"But God has fixed another part,"
6255,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And He has fixed it well;
6256,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"I said so with my bleeding heart,"
6257,DOMESTIC PEACE.,When first the anguish fell.
6258,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6259,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Thou, God, hast taken our delight,"
6260,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Our treasured hope away:
6261,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Thou bid'st us now weep through the night
6262,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And sorrow through the day.
6263,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6264,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"These weary hours will not be lost,"
6265,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"These days of misery,"
6266,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"These nights of darkness, anguish-tost,"
6267,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Can I but turn to Thee.
6268,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6269,DOMESTIC PEACE.,With secret labour to sustain
6270,DOMESTIC PEACE.,In humble patience every blow;
6271,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"To gather fortitude from pain,"
6272,DOMESTIC PEACE.,And hope and holiness from woe.
6273,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6274,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Thus let me serve Thee from my heart,"
6275,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Whate'er may be my written fate:
6276,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Whether thus early to depart,"
6277,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Or yet a while to wait.
6278,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6279,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"If Thou shouldst bring me back to life,"
6280,DOMESTIC PEACE.,More humbled I should be;
6281,DOMESTIC PEACE.,More wise--more strengthened for the strife--
6282,DOMESTIC PEACE.,More apt to lean on Thee.
6283,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6284,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Should death be standing at the gate,"
6285,DOMESTIC PEACE.,Thus should I keep my vow:
6286,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"But, Lord! whatever be my fate,"
6287,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"Oh, let me serve Thee now!"
6288,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6289,DOMESTIC PEACE.,
6290,DOMESTIC PEACE.,"These lines written, the desk was closed, the pen laid aside--for ever."
