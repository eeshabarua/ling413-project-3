51,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Blossom or berry or weed.
52,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Sweet though they be not, or fair,"
53,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"That the dew of your word kept growing,"
54,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Sweet at least was the seed.
55,JOSEPH MAZZINI,
56,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Men bring you love-offerings of tears,"

63,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"If a perfume be left, if a bloom,"
64,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Let it live till Italia be risen,"

76,JOSEPH MAZZINI,
77,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"It was wrought not with hands to smite,"

149,PRELUDE,
150,PRELUDE,BETWEEN the green bud and the red
151,PRELUDE,"Youth sat and sang by Time, and shed"
152,PRELUDE,"From eyes and tresses flowers and tears,"
153,PRELUDE,"From heart and spirit hopes and fears,"
154,PRELUDE,Upon the hollow stream whose bed
155,PRELUDE,Is channelled by the foamless years;
156,PRELUDE,And with the white the gold-haired head
157,PRELUDE,"Mixed running locks, and in Time’s ears"
158,PRELUDE,"Youth’s dreams hung singing, and Time’s truth"
159,PRELUDE,Was half not harsh in the ears of Youth.
160,PRELUDE,
161,PRELUDE,Between the bud and the blown flower
162,PRELUDE,"Youth talked with joy and grief an hour,"
163,PRELUDE,With footless joy and wingless grief
164,PRELUDE,And twin-born faith and disbelief
165,PRELUDE,Who share the seasons to devour;
166,PRELUDE,And long ere these made up their sheaf
167,PRELUDE,Felt the winds round him shake and shower
168,PRELUDE,"The rose-red and the blood-red leaf,"
169,PRELUDE,"Delight whose germ grew never grain,"
170,PRELUDE,And passion dyed in its own pain.
171,PRELUDE,
172,PRELUDE,"Then he stood up, and trod to dust"
173,PRELUDE,"Fear and desire, mistrust and trust,"
174,PRELUDE,"And dreams of bitter sleep and sweet,"
175,PRELUDE,And bound for sandals on his feet
176,PRELUDE,Knowledge and patience of what must
177,PRELUDE,"And what things may be, in the heat"
178,PRELUDE,And cold of years that rot and rust
179,PRELUDE,And alter; and his spirit’s meat
180,PRELUDE,"Was freedom, and his staff was wrought"
181,PRELUDE,"Of strength, and his cloak woven of thought."
182,PRELUDE,
183,PRELUDE,For what has he whose will sees clear
184,PRELUDE,"To do with doubt and faith and fear,"
185,PRELUDE,Swift hopes and slow despondencies?
186,PRELUDE,His heart is equal with the sea’s
187,PRELUDE,"And with the sea-wind’s, and his ear"
188,PRELUDE,"Is level to the speech of these,"
189,PRELUDE,And his soul communes and takes cheer
190,PRELUDE,"With the actual earth’s equalities,"
191,PRELUDE,"Air, light, and night, hills, winds, and streams,"
192,PRELUDE,And seeks not strength from strengthless dreams.
193,PRELUDE,
194,PRELUDE,His soul is even with the sun
195,PRELUDE,"Whose spirit and whose eye are one,"
196,PRELUDE,"Who seeks not stars by day, nor light"
197,PRELUDE,And heavy heat of day by night.
198,PRELUDE,"Him can no God cast down, whom none"
199,PRELUDE,Can lift in hope beyond the height
200,PRELUDE,Of fate and nature and things done
201,PRELUDE,By the calm rule of might and right
202,PRELUDE,"That bids men be and bear and do,"
203,PRELUDE,And die beneath blind skies or blue.
204,PRELUDE,
205,PRELUDE,To him the lights of even and morn
206,PRELUDE,"Speak no vain things of love or scorn,"
207,PRELUDE,Fancies and passions miscreate
208,PRELUDE,By man in things dispassionate.
209,PRELUDE,Nor holds he fellowship forlorn
210,PRELUDE,"With souls that pray and hope and hate,"
211,PRELUDE,"And doubt they had better not been born,"
212,PRELUDE,And fain would lure or scare off fate
213,PRELUDE,And charm their doomsman from their doom
214,PRELUDE,And make fear dig its own false tomb.
215,PRELUDE,
216,PRELUDE,He builds not half of doubts and half
217,PRELUDE,"Of dreams his own soul’s cenotaph,"
218,PRELUDE,"Whence hopes and fears with helpless eyes,"
219,PRELUDE,"Wrapt loose in cast-off cerecloths, rise"
220,PRELUDE,"And dance and wring their hands and laugh,"
221,PRELUDE,"And weep thin tears and sigh light sighs,"
222,PRELUDE,And without living lips would quaff
223,PRELUDE,"The living spring in man that lies,"
224,PRELUDE,And drain his soul of faith and strength
225,PRELUDE,It might have lived on a life’s length.
226,PRELUDE,
227,PRELUDE,He hath given himself and hath not sold
228,PRELUDE,"To God for heaven or man for gold,"
229,PRELUDE,"Or grief for comfort that it gives,"
230,PRELUDE,Or joy for grief’s restoratives.
231,PRELUDE,"He hath given himself to time, whose fold"
232,PRELUDE,Shuts in the mortal flock that lives
233,PRELUDE,On its plain pasture’s heat and cold
234,PRELUDE,And the equal year’s alternatives.
235,PRELUDE,"Earth, heaven, and time, death, life, and he,"
236,PRELUDE,Endure while they shall be to be.
237,PRELUDE,
238,PRELUDE,“Yet between death and life are hours
239,PRELUDE,To flush with love and hide in flowers;
240,PRELUDE,What profit save in these?” men cry:
241,PRELUDE,"“Ah, see, between soft earth and sky,"
242,PRELUDE,What only good things here are ours!”
243,PRELUDE,"They say, “what better wouldst thou try,"
244,PRELUDE,What sweeter sing of? or what powers
245,PRELUDE,"Serve, that will give thee ere thou die"
246,PRELUDE,"More joy to sing and be less sad,"
247,PRELUDE,More heart to play and grow more glad?”
248,PRELUDE,
249,PRELUDE,"Play then and sing; we too have played,"
250,PRELUDE,"We likewise, in that subtle shade."
251,PRELUDE,We too have twisted through our hair
252,PRELUDE,"Such tendrils as the wild Loves wear,"
253,PRELUDE,"And heard what mirth the Mænads made,"
254,PRELUDE,Till the wind blew our garlands bare
255,PRELUDE,"And left their roses disarrayed,"
256,PRELUDE,"And smote the summer with strange air,"
257,PRELUDE,And disengirdled and discrowned
258,PRELUDE,The limbs and locks that vine-wreaths bound.
259,PRELUDE,
260,PRELUDE,We too have tracked by star-proof trees
261,PRELUDE,The tempest of the Thyiades
262,PRELUDE,Scare the loud night on hills that hid
263,PRELUDE,"The blood-feasts of the Bassarid,"
264,PRELUDE,Heard their song’s iron cadences
265,PRELUDE,"Fright the wolf hungering from the kid,"
266,PRELUDE,"Outroar the lion-throated seas,"
267,PRELUDE,"Outchide the north-wind if it chid,"
268,PRELUDE,And hush the torrent-tongued ravines
269,PRELUDE,With thunders of their tambourines.
270,PRELUDE,
271,PRELUDE,But the fierce flute whose notes acclaim
272,PRELUDE,"Dim goddesses of fiery fame,"
273,PRELUDE,"Cymbal and clamorous kettledrum,"
274,PRELUDE,"Timbrels and tabrets, all are dumb"
275,PRELUDE,That turned the high chill air to flame;
276,PRELUDE,The singing tongues of fire are numb
277,PRELUDE,That called on Cotys by her name
278,PRELUDE,"Edonian, till they felt her come"
279,PRELUDE,"And maddened, and her mystic face"
280,PRELUDE,Lightened along the streams of Thrace.
281,PRELUDE,
282,PRELUDE,"For Pleasure slumberless and pale,"
283,PRELUDE,"And Passion with rejected veil,"
284,PRELUDE,"Pass, and the tempest-footed throng"
285,PRELUDE,Of hours that follow them with song
286,PRELUDE,"Till their feet flag and voices fail,"
287,PRELUDE,And lips that were so loud so long
288,PRELUDE,"Learn silence, or a wearier wail;"
289,PRELUDE,"So keen is change, and time so strong,"
290,PRELUDE,To weave the robes of life and rend
291,PRELUDE,And weave again till life have end.
292,PRELUDE,
293,PRELUDE,"But weak is change, but strengthless time,"
294,PRELUDE,"To take the light from heaven, or climb"
295,PRELUDE,The hills of heaven with wasting feet.
296,PRELUDE,"Songs they can stop that earth found meet,"
297,PRELUDE,But the stars keep their ageless rhyme;
298,PRELUDE,"Flowers they can slay that spring thought sweet,"
299,PRELUDE,But the stars keep their spring sublime;
300,PRELUDE,"Passions and pleasures can defeat,"
301,PRELUDE,"Actions and agonies control,"
302,PRELUDE,"And life and death, but not the soul."
303,PRELUDE,
304,PRELUDE,"Because man’s soul is man’s God still,"
305,PRELUDE,What wind soever waft his will
306,PRELUDE,Across the waves of day and night
307,PRELUDE,"To port or shipwreck, left or right,"
308,PRELUDE,By shores and shoals of good and ill;
309,PRELUDE,And still its flame at mainmast height
310,PRELUDE,Through the rent air that foam-flakes fill
311,PRELUDE,Sustains the indomitable light
312,PRELUDE,Whence only man hath strength to steer
313,PRELUDE,Or helm to handle without fear.
314,PRELUDE,
315,PRELUDE,"Save his own soul’s light overhead,"
316,PRELUDE,"None leads him, and none ever led,"
317,PRELUDE,"Across birth’s hidden harbour-bar,"
318,PRELUDE,"Past youth where shoreward shallows are,"
319,PRELUDE,Through age that drives on toward the red
320,PRELUDE,"Vast void of sunset hailed from far,"
321,PRELUDE,To the equal waters of the dead;
322,PRELUDE,"Save his own soul he hath no star,"
323,PRELUDE,"And sinks, except his own soul guide,"
324,PRELUDE,Helmless in middle turn of tide.
325,PRELUDE,
326,PRELUDE,No blast of air or fire of sun
327,PRELUDE,Puts out the light whereby we run
328,PRELUDE,"With girded loins our lamplit race,"
329,PRELUDE,And each from each takes heart of grace
330,PRELUDE,"And spirit till his turn be done,"
331,PRELUDE,And light of face from each man’s face
332,PRELUDE,In whom the light of trust is one;
333,PRELUDE,Since only souls that keep their place
334,PRELUDE,"By their own light, and watch things roll,"
335,PRELUDE,"And stand, have light for any soul."
336,PRELUDE,
337,PRELUDE,A little time we gain from time
338,PRELUDE,"To set our seasons in some chime,"
339,PRELUDE,"For harsh or sweet or loud or low,"
340,PRELUDE,With seasons played out long ago
341,PRELUDE,And souls that in their time and prime
342,PRELUDE,"Took part with summer or with snow,"
343,PRELUDE,"Lived abject lives out or sublime,"
344,PRELUDE,And had their chance of seed to sow
345,PRELUDE,For service or disservice done
346,PRELUDE,To those days daed and this their son.
347,PRELUDE,
348,PRELUDE,A little time that we may fill
349,PRELUDE,Or with such good works or such ill
350,PRELUDE,As loose the bonds or make them strong
351,PRELUDE,Wherein all manhood suffers wrong.
352,PRELUDE,By rose-hung river and light-foot rill
353,PRELUDE,There are who rest not; who think long
354,PRELUDE,Till they discern as from a hill
355,PRELUDE,"At the sun’s hour of morning song,"
356,PRELUDE,"Known of souls only, and those souls free,"
357,PRELUDE,The sacred spaces of the sea.

371,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"With passion of couched limbs, as one who grieves"
372,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Sleeping, and in her sleep she sees uncurled"
373,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Dreams serpent-shapen, such as sickness weaves,"
374,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Down the wild wind of vision caught and whirled,"
375,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Dead leaves of sleep, thicker than autumn leaves,"
376,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Shadows of storm-shaped things,"
377,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Flights of dim tribes of kings,"
378,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"The reaping men that reap men for their sheaves,"

392,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Sound and resound the hollow shield of sky
393,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"With trumpet-throated winds that charge and cheer,"
394,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"And through the roar of the hours that fighting fly,"
395,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Through flight and fight and all the fluctuant fear,"
396,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"A sound sublimer than the heavens are high,"
397,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"A voice more instant than the winds are clear,"
398,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Say to my spirit, “Take"
399,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Thy trumpet too, and make"
400,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"A rallying music in the void night’s ear,"
401,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Till the storm lose its track,"
402,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,And all the night go back;
403,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Till, as through sleep false life knows true life near,"

415,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"By fits of breath and light and sound, that wake"
416,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"As out of sleep, and perish as the show"
417,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Built up of sleep, when all her strengths forsake"
418,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"The sense-compelling spirit; the depths glow,"
419,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"The heights flash, and the roots and summits shake"
420,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Of earth in all her mountains,"

422,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,And wellsprings of her fast-bound forces quake;
423,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Yea, the whole air of life"
424,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Is set on fire of strife,"
425,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Till change unmake things made and love remake;

444,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Dim face with deathless eyes and withered hair,"
445,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Fostress of obscure lands,"
446,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Whose multiplying hands
447,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Wove the world’s web with divers races fair

467,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,The first war fair as peace
468,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"To shine and lighten Greece,"
469,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"And the first freedom moved upon the deep,"
470,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,God’s breath upon the face of time

481,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Are they of stars or beacons that we see?
482,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Taygetus takes here the winds abreast,"

485,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,And Salamis the sea-wall of that sea.
486,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,The grass men tread upon
487,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Is very Marathon,"
488,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,The leaves are of that time-unstricken tree
489,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,That storm nor sun can fret
490,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Nor wind, since she that set"
491,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Made it her sign to men whose shield was she;

503,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Heaven, hast thou heard of men that would not die?"
504,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Is the land thick with only such men’s graves

524,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,And footless fields of sun-forgotten snow
525,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Feel through their creviced lips and iron veins
526,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Such quick breath labour and such clean blood flow
527,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,As summer-stricken spring feels in her pains
528,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"When dying May bears June, too young to know"
529,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,The fruit that waxes from the flower that wanes;
530,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Strange tyrannies and vast,"

532,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Lands that are loud all through their length with chains,"
533,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Wastes where the wind’s wings break,"
534,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Displumed by daylong ache
535,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"And anguish of blind snows and rack-blown rains,"
536,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"And ice that seals the White Sea’s lips,"

546,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Shining below the beamless aureole
547,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"That hangs about the north-wind’s hurtling hair,"
548,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"A comet-lighted lamp, sublime and sole"
549,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Dawn of the dayless heaven where suns despair;
550,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Earth, skies, and waters, smitten into soul,"
551,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Feel the hard veil that iron centuries wear
552,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Rent as with hands in sunder,"
553,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Such hands as make the thunder
554,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,And clothe with form all substance and strip bare;
555,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Shapes, shadows, sounds and lights"
556,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Of their dead days and nights
557,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Take soul of life too keen for death to bear;
558,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Life, conscience, forethought, will, desire,"

568,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Eyes, hands, and spirits, forged by fear and wonder"
569,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,And sleek fierce fraud with hidden knife behind;
570,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"There goes no fire from heaven before their thunder,"

574,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Priest is the staff of king,"

593,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,And the world’s weakness parcel of thy might;
594,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Thou seest us feeble and forceless, fit to be"
595,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Slaves of the years that drive us left and right,"
596,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Drowned under hours like waves
597,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Wherethrough we row like slaves;
598,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"But if thy finger touch us, these take flight."
599,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,If but one sovereign word
600,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Of thy live lips be heard,"
601,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"What man shall stop us, and what God shall smite?"
602,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Do thou but look in our dead eyes,"

613,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Time is wan And hope is weak with waiting, and swift thought"
614,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Hath lost the wings at heel wherewith he ran,"
615,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,And on the red pit’s edge sits down distraught
616,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,To talk with death of days republican
617,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,And dreams and fights long since dreamt out and fought;
618,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Of the last hope that drew
619,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,To that red edge anew
620,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,The firewhite faith of Poland without spot;
621,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Of the blind Russian might,"
622,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,And fire that is not light;
623,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Of the green Rhineland where thy spirit wrought;
624,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"But though time, hope, and memory tire,"

633,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,The night is broken westward; the wide sea
634,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,That makes immortal motion to and fro
635,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"From world’s end unto world’s end, and shall be"
636,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,When nought now grafted of men’s hands shall grow
637,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,And as the weed in last year’s waves are we
638,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Or spray the sea-wind shook a year ago
639,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"From its sharp tresses down the storm to lee,"
640,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,The moving god that hides
641,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Time in its timeless tides
642,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Wherein time dead seems live eternity,"
643,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,That breaks and makes again
644,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Much mightier things than men,"
645,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Doth it not hear change coming, or not see?"
646,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Are the deeps deaf and dead and blind,"

655,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Thy brave brows lightening through the grey wet air,"
656,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Thou, lulled with sea-sounds of a thousand caves,"
657,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"And lit with sea-shine to thine inland lair,"
658,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Whose freedom clothed the naked souls of slaves
659,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"And stripped the muffled souls of tyrants bare,"
660,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"O, by the centuries of thy glorious graves,"
661,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"By the live light of the earth that was thy care,"
662,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Live, thou must not be dead,"
663,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Live; let thine armèd head
664,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Lift itself up to sunward and the fair
665,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Daylight of time and man,"
666,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Thine head republican,"
667,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,With the same splendour on thine helmless hair
668,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,That in his eyes kept up a light
669,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Who on thy glory gazed away their sacred sight;
670,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,
671,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,
672,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,
673,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,15
674,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,
675,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,
676,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Who loved and looked their sense to death on thee;
677,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Who taught thy lips imperishable things,"
678,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,And in thine ears outsang thy singing sea;
679,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Who made thy foot firm on the necks of kings
680,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,And thy soul somewhile steadfast—woe are we
681,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"It was but for a while, and all the strings"
682,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Were broken of thy spirit; yet had he
683,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Set to such tunes and clothed it with such wings
684,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,It seemed for his sole sake
685,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Impossible to break,"
686,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"And woundless of the worm that waits and stings,"
687,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,The golden-headed worm
688,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Made headless for a term,"
689,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"The king-snake whose life kindles with the spring’s,"
690,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"To breathe his soul upon her bloom,"

699,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"And the secluded soul adorable,"
700,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"O Milton’s land, what ails thee to be dead?"
701,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Thine ears are yet sonorous with his shell
702,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,That all the songs of all thy sea-line fed
703,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"With motive sound of spring-tides at mid swell,"
704,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"And through thine heart his thought as blood is shed,"
705,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Requickening thee with wisdom to do well;
706,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Such sons were of thy womb,"
707,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"England, for love of whom"
708,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Thy name is not yet writ with theirs that fell,"
709,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"But, till thou quite forget"
710,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"What were thy children, yet"
711,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,On the pale lips of hope is as a spell;
712,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,And Shelley’s heart and Landor’s mind
713,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Lit thee with latter watch-fires; why wilt thou be blind?

718,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,

720,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Though all were else indifferent, all that live"
721,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Spiritless shapes of nations; though time wait
722,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"In vain on hope till these have help to give,"
723,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,And faith and love crawl famished from the gate;
724,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Canst thou sit shamed and self-contemplative
725,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,With soulless eyes on thy secluded fate?
726,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Though time forgive them, thee shall he forgive,"
727,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Whose choice was in thine hand to be so great?
728,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Who cast out of thy mind
729,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"The passion of man’s kind,"
730,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,And made thee and thine old name separate?
731,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Now when time looks to see
732,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,New names and old and thee
733,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Build up our one Republic state by state,"
734,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"England with France, and France with Spain,"
735,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,And Spain with sovereign Italy strike hands and reign.

743,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Our dear life-springs of England!  O bright race
744,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Of streams and waters that bear witness still
745,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,To the earth her sons were made of!  O fair face
746,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Of England, watched of eyes death cannot kill,"
747,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,How should the soul that lit you for a space
748,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Fall through sick weakness of a broken will
749,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,To the dead cold damnation of disgrace?
750,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Such wind of memory stirs
751,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"On all green hills of hers,"
752,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Such breath of record from so high a place,"
753,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,From years whose tongues of flame
754,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Prophesied in her name

834,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"That shall burn up thy foemen, and set free"
835,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,The flame whence thy sun-shadowing wings aspire?
836,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Love of our life, what more than men are we,"

858,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"What love, what life, what death of man’s should move thee,"
859,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,What face that lingers or what foot that flies?
860,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,It is not heaven that lights
861,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Thee with such days and nights,"
862,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,But thou that heaven is lit from in such wise.
863,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"O thou her dearest birth,"
864,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"Turn thee to lighten earth,"

884,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,But gives the music swifter feet to move
885,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Through sharp remeasuring tones
886,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,Of refluent antiphones
887,THE EVE OF REVOLUTION,"More tender-tuned than heart or throat of dove,"

2575,HERTHA,
2576,HERTHA,My own blood is what stanches
2577,HERTHA,The wounds in my bark;

2581,HERTHA,fires as a spark.
2582,HERTHA,
2583,HERTHA,Where dead ages hide under
2584,HERTHA,"The live roots of the tree,"
2585,HERTHA,In my darkness the thunder
2586,HERTHA,Makes utterance of me;
2587,HERTHA,In the clash of my boughs with each other ye hear the waves sound of
2588,HERTHA,the sea.
2589,HERTHA,
2590,HERTHA,"That noise is of Time,"

2596,HERTHA,
2597,HERTHA,The storm-winds of ages
2598,HERTHA,"Blow through me and cease,"
2599,HERTHA,"The war-wind that rages,"

2603,HERTHA,
2604,HERTHA,"All sounds of all changes,"
2605,HERTHA,All shadows and lights
2606,HERTHA,On the world’s mountain-ranges
2607,HERTHA,"And stream-riven heights,"
2608,HERTHA,Whose tongue is the wind’s tongue and language of storm-clouds on
2609,HERTHA,earth-shaking nights;
2610,HERTHA,
2611,HERTHA,"All forms of all faces,"
2612,HERTHA,All works of all hands
2613,HERTHA,In unsearchable places
2614,HERTHA,"Of time-stricken lands,"
2615,HERTHA,"All death and all life, and all reigns and all ruins, drop through me"
2616,HERTHA,as sands.
2617,HERTHA,
2618,HERTHA,Though sore be my burden
2619,HERTHA,"And more than ye know,"
2620,HERTHA,And my growth have no guerdon
2621,HERTHA,"But only to grow,"
2622,HERTHA,Yet I fail not of growing for lightnings above me or deathworms below.
2623,HERTHA,
2624,HERTHA,"These too have their part in me,"
2625,HERTHA,As I too in these;
2626,HERTHA,"Such fire is at heart in me,"
2627,HERTHA,"Such sap is this tree’s,"
2628,HERTHA,Which hath in it all sounds and all secrets of infinite lands and of
2629,HERTHA,seas.
2630,HERTHA,
2631,HERTHA,In the spring-coloured hours
2632,HERTHA,"When my mind was as May’s,"
2633,HERTHA,There brake forth of me flowers
2634,HERTHA,"By centuries of days,"
2635,HERTHA,"Strong blossoms with perfume of manhood, shot out from my spirit as"
2636,HERTHA,rays.
2637,HERTHA,
2638,HERTHA,And the sound of them springing
2639,HERTHA,And smell of their shoots
2640,HERTHA,Were as warmth and sweet singing
2641,HERTHA,And strength to my roots;
2642,HERTHA,And the lives of my children made perfect with freedom of soul were my
2643,HERTHA,fruits.
2644,HERTHA,
2645,HERTHA,I bid you but be;
2646,HERTHA,I have need not of prayer;
2647,HERTHA,I have need of you free
2648,HERTHA,As your mouths of mine air;
2649,HERTHA,"That my heart may be greater within me, beholding the fruits of me"
2650,HERTHA,fair.
2651,HERTHA,
2652,HERTHA,More fair than strange fruit is
2653,HERTHA,Of faiths ye espouse;
2654,HERTHA,In me only the root is
2655,HERTHA,That blooms in your boughs;
2656,HERTHA,"Behold now your God that ye made you, to feed him with faith of your"
2657,HERTHA,vows.
2658,HERTHA,
2659,HERTHA,In the darkening and whitening
2660,HERTHA,"Abysses adored,"
2661,HERTHA,With dayspring and lightning
2662,HERTHA,"For lamp and for sword,"
2663,HERTHA,"God thunders in heaven, and his angels are red with the wrath of the"

2665,HERTHA,
2666,HERTHA,"O my sons, O too dutiful"
2667,HERTHA,"Toward Gods not of me,"
2668,HERTHA,Was not I enough beautiful?
2669,HERTHA,Was it hard to be free?
2670,HERTHA,"For behold, I am with you, am in you and of you; look forth now and"
2671,HERTHA,see.
2672,HERTHA,
2673,HERTHA,"Lo, winged with world’s wonders,"
2674,HERTHA,"With miracles shod,"
2675,HERTHA,With the fires of his thunders
2676,HERTHA,"For raiment and rod,"
2677,HERTHA,"God trembles in heaven, and his angels are white with the terror of"
2678,HERTHA,God.
2679,HERTHA,
2680,HERTHA,"For his twilight is come on him,"
2681,HERTHA,His anguish is here;
2682,HERTHA,"And his spirits gaze dumb on him,"
2683,HERTHA,Grown grey from his fear;
2684,HERTHA,"And his hour taketh hold on him stricken, the last of his infinite"
2685,HERTHA,year.
2686,HERTHA,
2687,HERTHA,"Thought made him and breaks him,"
2688,HERTHA,Truth slays and forgives;
2689,HERTHA,"But to you, as time takes him,"
2690,HERTHA,"This new thing it gives,"
2691,HERTHA,"Even love, the beloved Republic, that feeds upon freedom and lives."
2692,HERTHA,
2693,HERTHA,"For truth only is living,"
2694,HERTHA,"Truth only is whole,"
2695,HERTHA,And the love of his giving
2696,HERTHA,Man’s polestar and pole;
2697,HERTHA,"Man, pulse of my centre, and fruit of my body, and seed of my soul."
2698,HERTHA,
2699,HERTHA,One birth of my bosom;
2700,HERTHA,One beam of mine eye;
2701,HERTHA,One topmost blossom
2702,HERTHA,That scales the sky;
2703,HERTHA,"Man, equal and one with me, man that is made of me, man that is I."

2840,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,"O royal, O republican"
2841,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,Face of the people bruised and dumb

2850,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,
2851,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,No fragment of it save the name

2857,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,
2858,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,And we seek yet if God or man
2859,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,"Can loosen thee as Lazarus,"
2860,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,Bid thee rise up republican
2861,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,And save thyself and all of us;
2862,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,But no disciple’s tongue can say
2863,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,When thou shalt take our sins away.
2864,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,
2865,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,And mouldering now and hoar with moss
2866,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,Between us and the sunlight swings
2867,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,The phantom of a Christless cross
2868,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,Shadowing the sheltered heads of kings
2869,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,And making with its moving shade
2870,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,The souls of harmless men afraid.
2871,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,
2872,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,It creaks and rocks to left and right
2873,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,"Consumed of rottenness and rust,"
2874,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,"Worm-eaten of the worms of night,"
2875,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,"Dead as their spirits who put trust,"

2882,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,"Who made songs erewhile of thy shame,"
2883,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,Give thou not ear; for these are they
2884,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,Whose good day was thine evil day.
2885,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,
2886,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,Set not thine hand unto their cross.
2887,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,Give not thy soul up sacrificed.
2888,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,Change not the gold of faith for dross
2889,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,Of Christian creeds that spit on Christ.
2890,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,Let not thy tree of freedom be
2891,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,Regrafted from that rotting tree.
2892,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,
2893,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,This dead God here against my face
2894,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,Hath help for no man; who hath seen
2895,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,"The good works of it, or such grace"
2896,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,"As thy grace in it, Nazarene,"
2897,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,As that from thy live lips which ran
2898,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,"For man’s sake, O thou son of man?"
2899,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,
2900,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,The tree of faith ingraffed by priests

2910,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,What did thy love or blood avail?

2912,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,And in gold shekels coin thy love.
2913,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,
2914,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,So when our souls look back to thee
2915,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,"They sicken, seeing against thy side,"
2916,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,"Too foul to speak of or to see,"
2917,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,"The leprous likeness of a bride,"
2918,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,Whose kissing lips through his lips grown
2919,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,Leave their God rotten to the bone.
2920,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,

2924,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,The lips of priests that pray and feed
2925,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,While their own hell’s worm curls and licks
2926,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,The poison of the crucifix.
2927,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,
2928,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,Thou bad’st let children come to thee;

2930,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,What manhood in that God can be
2931,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,"Who sees their worship, and is dumb?"
2932,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,"No soul that lived, loved, wrought, and died,"
2933,BEFORE A CRUCIFIX,Is this their carrion crucified.

3420,THE PILGRIMS,"WHO is your lady of love, O ye that pass"
3421,THE PILGRIMS,Singing? and is it for sorrow of that which was
3422,THE PILGRIMS,"That ye sing sadly, or dream of what shall be?"
3423,THE PILGRIMS,For gladly at once and sadly it seems ye sing.
3424,THE PILGRIMS,—Our lady of love by you is unbeholden;
3425,THE PILGRIMS,"For hands she hath none, nor eyes, nor lips, nor golden"
3426,THE PILGRIMS,"Treasure of hair, nor face nor form; but we"
3427,THE PILGRIMS,"That love, we know her more fair than anything."
3428,THE PILGRIMS,
3429,THE PILGRIMS,"—Is she a queen, having great gifts to give?"
3430,THE PILGRIMS,"—Yea, these; that whoso hath seen her shall not live"
3431,THE PILGRIMS,"Except he serve her sorrowing, with strange pain,"
3432,THE PILGRIMS,Travail and bloodshedding and bitterer tears;
3433,THE PILGRIMS,And when she bids die he shall surely die.
3434,THE PILGRIMS,And he shall leave all things under the sky
3435,THE PILGRIMS,And go forth naked under sun and rain
3436,THE PILGRIMS,And work and wait and watch out all his years.

3439,THE PILGRIMS,"—Age to age calling, nation answering nation,"
3440,THE PILGRIMS,"Cries out, Where is she? and there is none to say;"
3441,THE PILGRIMS,"For if she be not in the spirit of men,"
3442,THE PILGRIMS,"For if in the inward soul she hath no place,"
3443,THE PILGRIMS,"In vain they cry unto her, seeking her face,"
3444,THE PILGRIMS,In vain their mouths make much of her; for they

3446,THE PILGRIMS,
3447,THE PILGRIMS,"—O ye that follow, and have ye no repentance?"

3449,THE PILGRIMS,"An hieroglyph of sorrow, a fiery sign,"
3450,THE PILGRIMS,"That in your lives ye shall not pause or rest,"
3451,THE PILGRIMS,"Nor have the sure sweet common love, nor keep"
3452,THE PILGRIMS,"Friends and safe days, nor joy of life nor sleep."
3453,THE PILGRIMS,"—These have we not, who have one thing, the divine"
3454,THE PILGRIMS,Face and clear eyes of faith and fruitful breast.
3455,THE PILGRIMS,

3457,THE PILGRIMS,"—Yea, and the changed world and the liberal sun"

3461,THE PILGRIMS,"Laugh and give thanks, shall we be not content?"

3464,THE PILGRIMS,
3465,THE PILGRIMS,"—And these men shall forget you.—Yea, but we"
3466,THE PILGRIMS,"Shall be a part of the earth and the ancient sea,"
3467,THE PILGRIMS,"And heaven-high air august, and awful fire,"
3468,THE PILGRIMS,And all things good; and no man’s heart shall beat
3469,THE PILGRIMS,But somewhat in it of our blood once shed
3470,THE PILGRIMS,"Shall quiver and quicken, as now in us the dead"
3471,THE PILGRIMS,Blood of men slain and the old same life’s desire
3472,THE PILGRIMS,Plants in their fiery footprints our fresh feet.
3473,THE PILGRIMS,
3474,THE PILGRIMS,"—But ye that might be clothed with all things pleasant,"
3475,THE PILGRIMS,"Ye are foolish that put off the fair soft present,"
3476,THE PILGRIMS,That clothe yourselves with the cold future air;
3477,THE PILGRIMS,When mother and father and tender sister and brother
3478,THE PILGRIMS,"And the old live love that was shall be as ye,"
3479,THE PILGRIMS,"Dust, and no fruit of loving life shall be."
3480,THE PILGRIMS,"—She shall be yet who is more than all these were,"
3481,THE PILGRIMS,Than sister or wife or father unto us or mother.
3482,THE PILGRIMS,
3483,THE PILGRIMS,"—Is this worth life, is this, to win for wages?"
3484,THE PILGRIMS,"Lo, the dead mouths of the awful grey-grown ages,"
3485,THE PILGRIMS,"The venerable, in the past that is their prison,"
3486,THE PILGRIMS,"In the outer darkness, in the unopening grave,"
3487,THE PILGRIMS,"Laugh, knowing how many as ye now say have said,"
3488,THE PILGRIMS,"How many, and all are fallen, are fallen and dead:"
3489,THE PILGRIMS,"Shall ye dead rise, and these dead have not risen?"
3490,THE PILGRIMS,"—Not we but she, who is tender and swift to save"
3491,THE PILGRIMS,
3492,THE PILGRIMS,"—Are ye not weary and faint not by the way,"
3493,THE PILGRIMS,"Seeing night by night devoured of day by day,"
3494,THE PILGRIMS,Seeing hour by hour consumed in sleepless fire?
3495,THE PILGRIMS,"Sleepless: and ye too, when shall ye too sleep?"
3496,THE PILGRIMS,"—We are weary in heart and head, in hands and feet,"
3497,THE PILGRIMS,"And surely more than all things sleep were sweet,"
3498,THE PILGRIMS,Than all things save the inexorable desire
3499,THE PILGRIMS,Which whoso knoweth shall neither faint nor weep.
3500,THE PILGRIMS,
3501,THE PILGRIMS,—Is this so sweet that one were fain to follow?
3502,THE PILGRIMS,"Is this so sure where all men’s hopes are hollow,"
3503,THE PILGRIMS,"Even this your dream, that by much tribulation"
3504,THE PILGRIMS,"Ye shall make whole flawed hearts, and bowed necks straight?"
3505,THE PILGRIMS,"—Nay, though our life were blind, our death were fruitless,"
3506,THE PILGRIMS,Not therefore were the whole world’s high hope rootless;
3507,THE PILGRIMS,"But man to man, nation would turn to nation,"
3508,THE PILGRIMS,"And the old life live, and the old great word be great."
3509,THE PILGRIMS,
3510,THE PILGRIMS,"—Pass on then and pass by us and let us be,"
3511,THE PILGRIMS,For what light think ye after life to see?
3512,THE PILGRIMS,And if the world fare better will ye know?
3513,THE PILGRIMS,And if man triumph who shall seek you and say?
3514,THE PILGRIMS,"—Enough of light is this for one life’s span,"
3515,THE PILGRIMS,"That all men born are mortal, but not man:"
3516,THE PILGRIMS,"And we men bring death lives by night to sow,"
3517,THE PILGRIMS,That man may reap and eat and live by day.

3746,GENESIS,"Nor God laid hand on, nor was man found there,"
3747,GENESIS,"Ceased, and was cloven in several shapes; above"
3748,GENESIS,"Light, and night under, and fire, earth, water, and air."
3749,GENESIS,
3750,GENESIS,"Sunbeams and starbeams, and all coloured things,"
3751,GENESIS,All forms and all similitudes began;
3752,GENESIS,"And death, the shadow cast by life’s wide wings,"
3753,GENESIS,"And God, the shade cast by the soul of man."
3754,GENESIS,
3755,GENESIS,"Then between shadow and substance, night and light,"
3756,GENESIS,"Then between birth and death, and deeds and days,"
3757,GENESIS,The illimitable embrace and the amorous fight
3758,GENESIS,"That of itself begets, bears, rears, and slays,"

3765,GENESIS,All nature of all things began to be.
3766,GENESIS,"But chiefliest in the spirit (beast or man,"
3767,GENESIS,Planet of heaven or blossom of earth or sea)
3768,GENESIS,The divine contraries of life began.
3769,GENESIS,
3770,GENESIS,"For the great labour of growth, being many, is one;"
3771,GENESIS,One thing the white death and the ruddy birth;
3772,GENESIS,"The invisible air and the all-beholden sun,"
3773,GENESIS,And barren water and many-childed earth.
3774,GENESIS,
3775,GENESIS,And these things are made manifest in men
3776,GENESIS,From the beginning forth unto this day:
3777,GENESIS,"Time writes and life records them, and again"
3778,GENESIS,Death seals them lest the record pass away.
3779,GENESIS,
3780,GENESIS,"For if death were not, then should growth not be,"
3781,GENESIS,"Change, nor the life of good nor evil things;"
3782,GENESIS,"Nor were there night at all nor light to see,"
3783,GENESIS,Nor water of sweet nor water of bitter springs.
3784,GENESIS,
3785,GENESIS,For in each man and each year that is born
3786,GENESIS,Are sown the twin seeds of the strong twin powers;
3787,GENESIS,"The white seed of the fruitful helpful morn,"
3788,GENESIS,The black seed of the barren hurtful hours.
3789,GENESIS,
3790,GENESIS,"And he that of the black seed eateth fruit,"
3791,GENESIS,To him the savour as honey shall be sweet;
3792,GENESIS,"And he in whom the white seed hath struck root,"
3793,GENESIS,He shall have sorrow and trouble and tears for meat.
3794,GENESIS,
3795,GENESIS,And him whose lips the sweet fruit hath made red
3796,GENESIS,In the end men loathe and make his name a rod;
3797,GENESIS,And him whose mouth on the unsweet fruit hath fed
3798,GENESIS,In the end men follow and know for very God.
3799,GENESIS,
3800,GENESIS,"And of these twain, the black seed and the white,"
3801,GENESIS,"All things come forth, endured of men and done;"
3802,GENESIS,"And still the day is great with child of night,"
3803,GENESIS,And still the black night labours with the sun.
3804,GENESIS,
3805,GENESIS,And each man and each year that lives on earth
3806,GENESIS,"Turns hither or thither, and hence or thence is fed;"
3807,GENESIS,"And as a man before was from his birth,"
3808,GENESIS,So shall a man be after among the dead.

4626,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"The years are as thy garments, the world’s ages"
4627,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,As sandals bound and loosed from thy swift feet;
4628,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Time serves before thee, as one that hath for wages"
4629,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Praise or shame only, bitter words or sweet."
4630,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4631,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Thou sayest “Well done,” and all a century kindles;"
4632,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Again thou sayest “Depart from sight of me,”"
4633,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"And all the light of face of all men dwindles,"
4634,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,And the age is as the broken glass of thee.
4635,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4636,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"The night is as a seal set on men’s faces,"
4637,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"On faces fallen of men that take no light,"
4638,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Nor give light in the deeps of the dark places,"
4639,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Blind things, incorporate with the body of night."
4640,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4641,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Their souls are serpents winterbound and frozen,"
4642,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Their shame is as a tame beast, at their feet"
4643,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Couched; their cold lips deride thee and thy chosen,"
4644,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Their lying lips made grey with dust for meat.
4645,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4646,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Then when their time is full and days run over,"
4647,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,The splendour of thy sudden brow made bare
4648,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Darkens the morning; thy bared hands uncover
4649,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,The veils of light and night and the awful air.
4650,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4651,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,And the world naked as a new-born maiden
4652,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Stands virginal and splendid as at birth,"
4653,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"With all thine heaven of all its light unladen,"
4654,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Of all its love unburdened all thine earth.
4655,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4656,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,For the utter earth and the utter air of heaven
4657,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,And the extreme depth is thine and the extreme height;
4658,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Shadows of things and veils of ages riven
4659,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Are as men’s kings unkingdomed in thy sight.
4660,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4661,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Through the iron years, the centuries brazen-gated,"
4662,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"By the ages’ barred impenetrable doors,"
4663,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"From the evening to the morning have we waited,"
4664,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Should thy foot haply sound on the awful floors.
4665,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4666,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"The floors untrodden of the sun’s feet glimmer,"
4667,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,The star-unstricken pavements of the night;
4668,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Do the lights burn inside? the lights wax dimmer
4669,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,On festal faces withering out of sight.
4670,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4671,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,The crowned heads lose the light on them; it may be
4672,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Dawn is at hand to smite the loud feast dumb;
4673,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"To blind the torch-lit centuries till the day be,"
4674,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,The feasting kingdoms till thy kingdom come.
4675,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4676,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Shall it not come? deny they or dissemble,"
4677,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Is it not even as lightning from on high
4678,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Now? and though many a soul close eyes and tremble,"
4679,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,How should they tremble at all who love thee as I?
4680,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4681,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"I am thine harp between thine hands, O mother!"
4682,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,All my strong chords are strained with love of thee.
4683,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"We grapple in love and wrestle, as each with other"
4684,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Wrestle the wind and the unreluctant sea.
4685,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4686,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"I am no courtier of thee sober-suited,"
4687,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Who loves a little for a little pay.
4688,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Me not thy winds and storms nor thrones disrooted
4689,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Nor molten crowns nor thine own sins dismay.
4690,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4691,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Sinned hast thou sometime, therefore art thou sinless;"
4692,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Stained hast thou been, who art therefore without stain;"
4693,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Even as man’s soul is kin to thee, but kinless"
4694,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Thou, in whose womb Time sows the all-various grain."
4695,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4696,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"I do not bid thee spare me, O dreadful mother!"
4697,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"I pray thee that thou spare not, of thy grace."
4698,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"How were it with me then, if ever another"
4699,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Should come to stand before thee in this my place?
4700,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4701,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"I am the trumpet at thy lips, thy clarion"
4702,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Full of thy cry, sonorous with thy breath;"
4703,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,The graves of souls born worms and creeds grown carrion
4704,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Thy blast of judgment fills with fires of death.
4705,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4706,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Thou art the player whose organ-keys are thunders,"
4707,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,And I beneath thy foot the pedal prest;
4708,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Thou art the ray whereat the rent night sunders,"
4709,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,And I the cloudlet borne upon thy breast.
4710,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4711,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"I shall burn up before thee, pass and perish,"
4712,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,As haze in sunrise on the red sea-line;
4713,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,But thou from dawn to sunsetting shalt cherish
4714,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,The thoughts that led and souls that lighted mine.
4715,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4716,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Reared between night and noon and truth and error,"
4717,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Each twilight-travelling bird that trills and screams
4718,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Sickens at midday, nor can face for terror"
4719,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,The imperious heaven’s inevitable extremes.
4720,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4721,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,I have no spirit of skill with equal fingers
4722,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,At sign to sharpen or to slacken strings;
4723,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,I keep no time of song with gold-perched singers
4724,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,And chirp of linnets on the wrists of kings.
4725,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4726,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"I am thy storm-thrush of the days that darken,"
4727,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Thy petrel in the foam that bears thy bark
4728,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"To port through night and tempest; if thou hearken,"
4729,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,My voice is in thy heaven before the lark.
4730,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4731,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"My song is in the mist that hides thy morning,"
4732,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,My cry is up before the day for thee;
4733,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"I have heard thee and beheld thee and give warning,"
4734,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Before thy wheels divide the sky and sea.
4735,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4736,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Birds shall wake with thee voiced and feathered fairer,"
4737,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,To see in summer what I see in spring;
4738,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"I have eyes and heart to endure thee, O thunder-bearer,"
4739,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,And they shall be who shall have tongues to sing.
4740,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4741,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"I have love at least, and have not fear, and part not"
4742,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,From thine unnavigable and wingless way;
4743,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Thou tarriest, and I have not said thou art not,"
4744,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Nor all thy night long have denied thy day.
4745,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4746,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Darkness to daylight shall lift up thy pæan,"
4747,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Hill to hill thunder, vale cry back to vale,"
4748,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"With wind-notes as of eagles Æschylean,"
4749,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,And Sappho singing in the nightingale.
4750,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4751,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Sung to by mighty sons of dawn and daughters,"
4752,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Of this night’s songs thine ear shall keep but one;
4753,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"That supreme song which shook the channelled waters,"
4754,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,And called thee skyward as God calls the sun.
4755,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4756,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Come, though all heaven again be fire above thee;"
4757,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Though death before thee come to clear thy sky;
4758,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,Let us but see in his thy face who love thee;
4759,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,"Yea, though thou slay us, arise and let us die."
4760,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4761,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4762,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4763,MATER TRIUMPHALIS,
4764,A MARCHING SONG,A MARCHING SONG
4765,A MARCHING SONG,
4766,A MARCHING SONG,
4767,A MARCHING SONG,"WE mix from many lands,"
4768,A MARCHING SONG,We march for very far;
4769,A MARCHING SONG,In hearts and lips and hands
4770,A MARCHING SONG,Our staffs and weapons are;
4771,A MARCHING SONG,The light we walk in darkens sun and moon and star.
4772,A MARCHING SONG,
4773,A MARCHING SONG,It doth not flame and wane
4774,A MARCHING SONG,"With years and spheres that roll,"
4775,A MARCHING SONG,Storm cannot shake nor stain
4776,A MARCHING SONG,"The strength that makes it whole,"
4777,A MARCHING SONG,The fire that moulds and moves it of the sovereign soul.
4778,A MARCHING SONG,
4779,A MARCHING SONG,We are they that have to cope
4780,A MARCHING SONG,With time till time retire;
4781,A MARCHING SONG,"We live on hopeless hope,"
4782,A MARCHING SONG,We feed on tears and fire;
4783,A MARCHING SONG,"Time, foot by foot, gives back before our sheer desire."
4784,A MARCHING SONG,
4785,A MARCHING SONG,"From the edge of harsh derision,"
4786,A MARCHING SONG,"From discord and defeat,"
4787,A MARCHING SONG,"From doubt and lame division,"
4788,A MARCHING SONG,We pluck the fruit and eat;
4789,A MARCHING SONG,"And the mouth finds it bitter, and the spirit sweet."
4790,A MARCHING SONG,
4791,A MARCHING SONG,We strive with time at wrestling
4792,A MARCHING SONG,Till time be on our side
4793,A MARCHING SONG,"And hope, our plumeless nestling,"
4794,A MARCHING SONG,A full-fledged eaglet ride
4795,A MARCHING SONG,Down the loud length of storm its windward wings divide.
4796,A MARCHING SONG,
4797,A MARCHING SONG,"We are girt with our belief,"
4798,A MARCHING SONG,Clothed with our will and crowned;
4799,A MARCHING SONG,"Hope, fear, delight, and grief,"
4800,A MARCHING SONG,Before our will give ground;
4801,A MARCHING SONG,Their calls are in our ears as shadows of dead sound.
4802,A MARCHING SONG,
4803,A MARCHING SONG,"All but the heart forsakes us,"
4804,A MARCHING SONG,All fails us but the will;
4805,A MARCHING SONG,Keen treason tracks and takes us
4806,A MARCHING SONG,In pits for blood to fill;
4807,A MARCHING SONG,"Friend falls from friend, and faith for faith lays wait to kill."
4808,A MARCHING SONG,
4809,A MARCHING SONG,Out under moon and stars
4810,A MARCHING SONG,And shafts of the urgent sun
4811,A MARCHING SONG,Whose face on prison-bars
4812,A MARCHING SONG,"And mountain-heads is one,"
4813,A MARCHING SONG,Our march is everlasting till time’s march be done.
4814,A MARCHING SONG,
4815,A MARCHING SONG,"Whither we know, and whence,"
4816,A MARCHING SONG,And dare not care wherethrough.
4817,A MARCHING SONG,"Desires that urge the sense,"
4818,A MARCHING SONG,"Fears changing old with new,"
4819,A MARCHING SONG,Perils and pains beset the ways we press into;
4820,A MARCHING SONG,
4821,A MARCHING SONG,"Earth gives us thorns to tread,"
4822,A MARCHING SONG,And all her thorns are trod;
4823,A MARCHING SONG,Through lands burnt black and red
4824,A MARCHING SONG,We pass with feet unshod;
4825,A MARCHING SONG,"Whence we would be man shall not keep us, nor man’s God."
4826,A MARCHING SONG,
4827,A MARCHING SONG,Through the great desert beasts
4828,A MARCHING SONG,"Howl at our backs by night,"
4829,A MARCHING SONG,And thunder-forging priests
4830,A MARCHING SONG,"Blow their dead bale-fires bright,"
4831,A MARCHING SONG,And on their broken anvils beat out bolts for fight.
4832,A MARCHING SONG,
4833,A MARCHING SONG,Inside their sacred smithies
4834,A MARCHING SONG,"Though hot the hammer rings,"
4835,A MARCHING SONG,"Their steel links snap like withies,"
4836,A MARCHING SONG,"Their chains like twisted strings,"
4837,A MARCHING SONG,Their surest fetters are as plighted words of kings.
4838,A MARCHING SONG,
4839,A MARCHING SONG,"O nations undivided,"
4840,A MARCHING SONG,"O single people and free,"
4841,A MARCHING SONG,"We dreamers, we derided,"
4842,A MARCHING SONG,"We mad blind men that see,"
4843,A MARCHING SONG,We bear you witness ere ye come that ye shall be.
4844,A MARCHING SONG,
4845,A MARCHING SONG,"Ye sitting among tombs,"
4846,A MARCHING SONG,"Ye standing round the gate,"
4847,A MARCHING SONG,"Whom fire-mouthed war consumes,"
4848,A MARCHING SONG,"Or cold-lipped peace bids wait,"
4849,A MARCHING SONG,"All tombs and bars shall open, every grave and grate."
4850,A MARCHING SONG,
4851,A MARCHING SONG,"The locks shall burst in sunder,"
4852,A MARCHING SONG,"The hinges shrieking spin,"
4853,A MARCHING SONG,"When time, whose hand is thunder,"
4854,A MARCHING SONG,"Lays hand upon the pin,"
4855,A MARCHING SONG,"And shoots the bolts reluctant, bidding all men in."
4856,A MARCHING SONG,
4857,A MARCHING SONG,"These eyeless times and earless,"
4858,A MARCHING SONG,"Shall these not see and hear,"
4859,A MARCHING SONG,And all their hearts burn fearless
4860,A MARCHING SONG,That were afrost for fear?
4861,A MARCHING SONG,"Is day not hard upon us, yea, not our day near?"
4862,A MARCHING SONG,
4863,A MARCHING SONG,France! from its grey dejection
4864,A MARCHING SONG,Make manifest the red
4865,A MARCHING SONG,Tempestuous resurrection
4866,A MARCHING SONG,Of thy most sacred head!
4867,A MARCHING SONG,Break thou the covering cerecloths; rise up from the dead.
4868,A MARCHING SONG,
4869,A MARCHING SONG,"And thou, whom sea-walls sever"
4870,A MARCHING SONG,"From lands unwalled with seas,"
4871,A MARCHING SONG,"Wilt thou endure for ever,"
4872,A MARCHING SONG,"O Milton’s England, these?"
4873,A MARCHING SONG,"Thou that wast his Republic, wilt thou clasp their knees?"
4874,A MARCHING SONG,
4875,A MARCHING SONG,"These royalties rust-eaten,"
4876,A MARCHING SONG,"These worm-corroded lies,"
4877,A MARCHING SONG,That keep thine head storm-beaten
4878,A MARCHING SONG,And sunlike strength of eyes
4879,A MARCHING SONG,From the open heaven and air of intercepted skies;
4880,A MARCHING SONG,
4881,A MARCHING SONG,These princelings with gauze winglets
4882,A MARCHING SONG,"That buzz in the air unfurled,"
4883,A MARCHING SONG,"These summer-swarming kinglets,"
4884,A MARCHING SONG,"These thin worms crowned and curled,"
4885,A MARCHING SONG,That bask and blink and warm themselves about the world;
4886,A MARCHING SONG,
4887,A MARCHING SONG,"These fanged meridian vermin,"
4888,A MARCHING SONG,"Shrill gnats that crowd the dusk,"
4889,A MARCHING SONG,Night-moths whose nestling ermine
4890,A MARCHING SONG,"Smells foul of mould and musk,"
4891,A MARCHING SONG,Blind flesh-flies hatched by dark and hampered in their husk;
4892,A MARCHING SONG,
4893,A MARCHING SONG,"These honours without honour,"
4894,A MARCHING SONG,"These ghost-like gods of gold,"
4895,A MARCHING SONG,This earth that wears upon her
4896,A MARCHING SONG,To keep her heart from cold
4897,A MARCHING SONG,No memory more of men that brought it fire of old;
4898,A MARCHING SONG,
4899,A MARCHING SONG,"These limbs, supine, unbuckled,"
4900,A MARCHING SONG,"In rottenness of rest,"
4901,A MARCHING SONG,These sleepy lips blood-suckled
4902,A MARCHING SONG,"And satiate of thy breast,"
4903,A MARCHING SONG,These dull wide mouths that drain thee dry and call thee blest;
4904,A MARCHING SONG,
4905,A MARCHING SONG,These masters of thee mindless
4906,A MARCHING SONG,"That wear thee out of mind,"
4907,A MARCHING SONG,These children of thee kindless
4908,A MARCHING SONG,"That use thee out of kind,"
4909,A MARCHING SONG,Whose hands strew gold before thee and contempt behind;
4910,A MARCHING SONG,
4911,A MARCHING SONG,"Who have turned thy name to laughter,"
4912,A MARCHING SONG,Thy sea-like sounded name
4913,A MARCHING SONG,That now none hearkens after
4914,A MARCHING SONG,"For faith in its free fame,"
4915,A MARCHING SONG,Who have robbed thee of thy trust and given thee of their shame;
4916,A MARCHING SONG,
4917,A MARCHING SONG,"These hours that mock each other,"
4918,A MARCHING SONG,"These years that kill and die,"
4919,A MARCHING SONG,"Are these thy gains, our mother,"
4920,A MARCHING SONG,For all thy gains thrown by?
4921,A MARCHING SONG,Is this that end whose promise made thine heart so high?
4922,A MARCHING SONG,
4923,A MARCHING SONG,With empire and with treason
4924,A MARCHING SONG,"The first right hand made fast,"
4925,A MARCHING SONG,But in man’s nobler season
4926,A MARCHING SONG,"To put forth help the last,"
4927,A MARCHING SONG,"Love turns from thee, and memory disavows thy past."
4928,A MARCHING SONG,
4929,A MARCHING SONG,"Lest thine own sea disclaim thee,"
4930,A MARCHING SONG,"Lest thine own sons despise,"
4931,A MARCHING SONG,Lest lips shoot out that name thee
4932,A MARCHING SONG,"And seeing thee men shut eyes,"
4933,A MARCHING SONG,"Take thought with all thy people, turn thine head and rise."
4934,A MARCHING SONG,
4935,A MARCHING SONG,"Turn thee, lift up thy face;"
4936,A MARCHING SONG,What ails thee to be dead?
4937,A MARCHING SONG,"Ask of thyself for grace,"
4938,A MARCHING SONG,"Seek of thyself for bread,"
4939,A MARCHING SONG,"And who shall starve or shame thee, blind or bruise thine head?"
4940,A MARCHING SONG,
4941,A MARCHING SONG,"The same sun in thy sight,"
4942,A MARCHING SONG,"The same sea in thine ears,"
4943,A MARCHING SONG,"That saw thine hour at height,"
4944,A MARCHING SONG,"That sang thy song of years,"
4945,A MARCHING SONG,"Behold and hearken for thee, knowing thy hopes and fears."
4946,A MARCHING SONG,
4947,A MARCHING SONG,"O people, O perfect nation,"
4948,A MARCHING SONG,"O England that shall be,"
4949,A MARCHING SONG,How long till thou take station?
4950,A MARCHING SONG,How long till thralls live free?
4951,A MARCHING SONG,How long till all thy soul be one with all thy sea?
4952,A MARCHING SONG,
4953,A MARCHING SONG,"Ye that from south to north,"
4954,A MARCHING SONG,"Ye that from east to west,"
4955,A MARCHING SONG,Stretch hands of longing forth
4956,A MARCHING SONG,"And keep your eyes from rest,"
4957,A MARCHING SONG,"Lo, when ye will, we bring you gifts of what is best."
4958,A MARCHING SONG,
4959,A MARCHING SONG,From the awful northland pines
4960,A MARCHING SONG,That skirt their wan dim seas
4961,A MARCHING SONG,To the ardent Apennines
4962,A MARCHING SONG,"And sun-struck Pyrenees,"
4963,A MARCHING SONG,One frost on all their frondage bites the blossoming trees.
4964,A MARCHING SONG,
4965,A MARCHING SONG,"The leaves look up for light,"
4966,A MARCHING SONG,For heat of helpful air;
4967,A MARCHING SONG,The trees of oldest height
4968,A MARCHING SONG,And thin storm-shaken hair
4969,A MARCHING SONG,Seek with gaunt hands up heavenward if the sun be there.
4970,A MARCHING SONG,
4971,A MARCHING SONG,"The woods where souls walk lonely,"
4972,A MARCHING SONG,"The forests girt with night,"
4973,A MARCHING SONG,Desire the day-star only
4974,A MARCHING SONG,And firstlings of the light
4975,A MARCHING SONG,Not seen of slaves nor shining in their masters’ sight.
4976,A MARCHING SONG,
4977,A MARCHING SONG,"We have the morning star,"
4978,A MARCHING SONG,"O foolish people, O kings!"
4979,A MARCHING SONG,"With us the day-springs are,"
4980,A MARCHING SONG,Even all the fresh day-springs;
4981,A MARCHING SONG,"For us, and with us, all the multitudes of things."
4982,A MARCHING SONG,
4983,A MARCHING SONG,"O sorrowing hearts of slaves,"
4984,A MARCHING SONG,We heard you beat from far!
4985,A MARCHING SONG,"We bring the light that saves,"
4986,A MARCHING SONG,We bring the morning star;
4987,A MARCHING SONG,"Freedom’s good things we bring you, whence all good things are."
4988,A MARCHING SONG,
4989,A MARCHING SONG,With us the winds and fountains
4990,A MARCHING SONG,And lightnings live in tune;
4991,A MARCHING SONG,The morning-coloured mountains
4992,A MARCHING SONG,"That burn into the noon,"
4993,A MARCHING SONG,The mist’s mild veil on valleys muffled from the moon:
4994,A MARCHING SONG,
4995,A MARCHING SONG,The thunder-darkened highlands
4996,A MARCHING SONG,"And lowlands hot with fruit,"
4997,A MARCHING SONG,"Sea-bays and shoals and islands,"
4998,A MARCHING SONG,"And cliffs that foil man’s foot,"
4999,A MARCHING SONG,And all the flower of large-limbed life and all the root:
5000,A MARCHING SONG,
5001,A MARCHING SONG,The clangour of sea-eagles
5002,A MARCHING SONG,That teach the morning mirth
5003,A MARCHING SONG,With baying of heaven’s beagles
5004,A MARCHING SONG,"That seek their prey on earth,"
5005,A MARCHING SONG,"By sounding strait and channel, gulf and reach and firth."
5006,A MARCHING SONG,
5007,A MARCHING SONG,"With us the fields and rivers,"
5008,A MARCHING SONG,"The grass that summer thrills,"
5009,A MARCHING SONG,"The haze where morning quivers,"
5010,A MARCHING SONG,"The peace at heart of hills,"

5041,SIENA,
5042,SIENA,
5043,SIENA,INSIDE this northern summer’s fold
5044,SIENA,"The fields are full of naked gold,"
5045,SIENA,Broadcast from heaven on lands it loves;
5046,SIENA,The green veiled air is full of doves;
5047,SIENA,Soft leaves that sift the sunbeams let
5048,SIENA,Light on the small warm grasses wet
5049,SIENA,"Fall in short broken kisses sweet,"
5050,SIENA,And break again like waves that beat
5051,SIENA,Round the sun’s feet.
5052,SIENA,
5053,SIENA,"But I, for all this English mirth"
5054,SIENA,"Of golden-shod and dancing days,"
5055,SIENA,"And the old green-girt sweet-hearted earth,"
5056,SIENA,Desire what here no spells can raise.
5057,SIENA,"Far hence, with holier heavens above,"
5058,SIENA,The lovely city of my love
5059,SIENA,Bathes deep in the sun-satiate air
5060,SIENA,That flows round no fair thing more fair
5061,SIENA,Her beauty bare.
5062,SIENA,
5063,SIENA,"There the utter sky is holier, there"
5064,SIENA,"More pure the intense white height of air,"
5065,SIENA,"More clear men’s eyes that mine would meet,"
5066,SIENA,And the sweet springs of things more sweet.
5067,SIENA,There for this one warm note of doves
5068,SIENA,A clamour of a thousand loves
5069,SIENA,"Storms the night’s ear, the day’s assails,"
5070,SIENA,"From the tempestuous nightingales,"
5071,SIENA,"And fills, and fails."
5072,SIENA,
5073,SIENA,"O gracious city well-beloved,"
5074,SIENA,"Italian, and a maiden crowned,"
5075,SIENA,"Siena, my feet are no more moved"
5076,SIENA,Toward thy strange-shapen mountain-bound:
5077,SIENA,"But my heart in me turns and moves,"
5078,SIENA,"O lady loveliest of my loves,"
5079,SIENA,"Toward thee, to lie before thy feet"
5080,SIENA,And gaze from thy fair fountain-seat
5081,SIENA,Up the sheer street;
5082,SIENA,
5083,SIENA,And the house midway hanging see
5084,SIENA,"That saw Saint Catherine bodily,"
5085,SIENA,"Felt on its floors her sweet feet move,"
5086,SIENA,And the live light of fiery love
5087,SIENA,"Burn from her beautiful strange face,"
5088,SIENA,As in the sanguine sacred place
5089,SIENA,Where in pure hands she took the head
5090,SIENA,"Severed, and with pure lips still red"
5091,SIENA,Kissed the lips dead.
5092,SIENA,
5093,SIENA,"For years through, sweetest of the saints,"
5094,SIENA,"In quiet without cease she wrought,"
5095,SIENA,Till cries of men and fierce complaints
5096,SIENA,From outward moved her maiden thought;
5097,SIENA,"And prayers she heard and sighs toward France,"
5098,SIENA,"“God, send us back deliverance,"
5099,SIENA,"Send back thy servant, lest we die!”"
5100,SIENA,With an exceeding bitter cry
5101,SIENA,They smote the sky.
5102,SIENA,
5103,SIENA,Then in her sacred saving hands
5104,SIENA,"She took the sorrows of the lands,"
5105,SIENA,With maiden palms she lifted up
5106,SIENA,"The sick time’s blood-embittered cup,"
5107,SIENA,And in her virgin garment furled
5108,SIENA,The faint limbs of a wounded world.
5109,SIENA,"Clothed with calm love and clear desire,"
5110,SIENA,"She went forth in her soul’s attire,"
5111,SIENA,A missive fire.
5112,SIENA,
5113,SIENA,Across the might of men that strove
5114,SIENA,"It shone, and over heads of kings;"
5115,SIENA,And molten in red flames of love
5116,SIENA,Were swords and many monstrous things;
5117,SIENA,"And shields were lowered, and snapt were spears,"
5118,SIENA,And sweeter-tuned the clamorous years;
5119,SIENA,"And faith came back, and peace, that were"
5120,SIENA,"Fled; for she bade, saying, “Thou, God’s heir,"
5121,SIENA,Hast thou no care?
5122,SIENA,
5123,SIENA,"“Lo, men lay waste thine heritage"
5124,SIENA,"Still, and much heathen people rage"
5125,SIENA,"Against thee, and devise vain things."
5126,SIENA,"What comfort in the face of kings,"
5127,SIENA,What counsel is there?  Turn thine eyes
5128,SIENA,And thine heart from them in like wise;
5129,SIENA,Turn thee unto thine holy place
5130,SIENA,To help us that of God for grace
5131,SIENA,Require thy face.
5132,SIENA,
5133,SIENA,“For who shall hear us if not thou
5134,SIENA,In a strange land? what doest thou there?
5135,SIENA,"Thy sheep are spoiled, and the ploughers plough"
5136,SIENA,Upon us; why hast thou no care
5137,SIENA,"For all this, and beyond strange hills"
5138,SIENA,Liest unregardful what snow chills
5139,SIENA,"Thy foldless flock, or what rains beat?"
5140,SIENA,"Lo, in thine ears, before thy feet,"
5141,SIENA,Thy lost sheep bleat.
5142,SIENA,
5143,SIENA,"“And strange men feed on faultless lives,"
5144,SIENA,"And there is blood, and men put knives,"
5145,SIENA,"Shepherd, unto the young lamb’s throat;"
5146,SIENA,"And one hath eaten, and one smote,"
5147,SIENA,And one had hunger and is fed
5148,SIENA,"Full of the flesh of these, and red"
5149,SIENA,With blood of these as who drinks wine
5150,SIENA,"And God knoweth, who hath sent thee a sign,"
5151,SIENA,If these were thine.”
5152,SIENA,
5153,SIENA,"But the Pope’s heart within him burned,"
5154,SIENA,"So that he rose up, seeing the sign,"
5155,SIENA,And came among them; but she turned
5156,SIENA,"Back to her daily way divine,"
5157,SIENA,"And fed her faith with silent things,"
5158,SIENA,"And lived her life with curbed white wings,"
5159,SIENA,And mixed herself with heaven and died:
5160,SIENA,And now on the sheer city-side
5161,SIENA,Smiles like a bride.
5162,SIENA,
5163,SIENA,"You see her in the fresh clear gloom,"
5164,SIENA,Where walls shut out the flame and bloom
5165,SIENA,"Of full-breathed summer, and the roof"
5166,SIENA,Keeps the keen ardent air aloof
5167,SIENA,And sweet weight of the violent sky:
5168,SIENA,"There bodily beheld on high,"
5169,SIENA,She seems as one hearing in tune
5170,SIENA,"Heaven within heaven, at heaven’s full noon,"
5171,SIENA,In sacred swoon:
5172,SIENA,
5173,SIENA,A solemn swoon of sense that aches
5174,SIENA,"With imminent blind heat of heaven,"
5175,SIENA,"While all the wide-eyed spirit wakes,"
5176,SIENA,"Vigilant of the supreme Seven,"
5177,SIENA,"Whose choral flames in God’s sight move,"
5178,SIENA,"Made unendurable with love,"
5179,SIENA,That without wind or blast of breath
5180,SIENA,Compels all things through life and death
5181,SIENA,Whither God saith.
5182,SIENA,
5183,SIENA,There on the dim side-chapel wall
5184,SIENA,"Thy mighty touch memorial,"
5185,SIENA,"Razzi, raised up, for ages dead,"
5186,SIENA,And fixed for us her heavenly head:
5187,SIENA,"And, rent with plaited thorn and rod,"
5188,SIENA,Bared the live likeness of her God
5189,SIENA,"To men’s eyes turning from strange lands,"
5190,SIENA,"Where, pale from thine immortal hands,"
5191,SIENA,Christ wounded stands;
5192,SIENA,
5193,SIENA,And the blood blots his holy hair
5194,SIENA,And white brows over hungering eyes
5195,SIENA,"That plead against us, and the fair"
5196,SIENA,Mute lips forlorn of words or sighs
5197,SIENA,In the great torment that bends down
5198,SIENA,"His bruised head with the bloomless crown,"
5199,SIENA,"White as the unfruitful thorn-flower,"
5200,SIENA,A God beheld in dreams that were
5201,SIENA,Beheld of her.
5202,SIENA,
5203,SIENA,In vain on all these sins and years
5204,SIENA,"Falls the sad blood, fall the slow tears;"
5205,SIENA,"In vain poured forth as watersprings,"
5206,SIENA,"Priests, on your altars, and ye, kings,"
5207,SIENA,About your seats of sanguine gold;
5208,SIENA,"Still your God, spat upon and sold,"
5209,SIENA,Bleeds at your hands; but now is gone
5210,SIENA,All his flock from him saving one;
5211,SIENA,Judas alone.
5212,SIENA,
5213,SIENA,"Surely your race it was that he,"
5214,SIENA,"O men signed backward with his name,"
5215,SIENA,Beholding in Gethsemane
5216,SIENA,"Bled the red bitter sweat of shame,"
5217,SIENA,Knowing how the word of Christian should
5218,SIENA,"Mean to men evil and not good,"
5219,SIENA,"Seem to men shameful for your sake,"
5220,SIENA,"Whose lips, for all the prayers they make,"
5221,SIENA,Man’s blood must slake.
5222,SIENA,
5223,SIENA,"But blood nor tears ye love not, you"
5224,SIENA,"That my love leads my longing to,"
5225,SIENA,"Fair as the world’s old faith of flowers,"
5226,SIENA,O golden goddesses of ours!
5227,SIENA,From what Idalian rose-pleasance
5228,SIENA,Hath Aphrodite bidden glance
5229,SIENA,The lovelier lightnings of your feet?
5230,SIENA,From what sweet Paphian sward or seat
5231,SIENA,Led you more sweet?
5232,SIENA,
5233,SIENA,"O white three sisters, three as one,"
5234,SIENA,With flowerlike arms for flowery bands
5235,SIENA,"Your linked limbs glitter like the sun,"
5236,SIENA,And time lies beaten at your hands.
5237,SIENA,Time and wild years and wars and men
5238,SIENA,"Pass, and ye care not whence or when;"
5239,SIENA,"With calm lips over sweet for scorn,"
5240,SIENA,"Ye watch night pass, O children born"
5241,SIENA,Of the old-world morn.
5242,SIENA,
5243,SIENA,"Ah, in this strange and shrineless place,"
5244,SIENA,"What doth a goddess, what a Grace,"
5245,SIENA,Where no Greek worships her shrined limbs
5246,SIENA,With wreaths and Cytherean hymns?
5247,SIENA,Where no lute makes luxurious
5248,SIENA,"The adoring airs in Amathus,"
5249,SIENA,"Till the maid, knowing her mother near,"
5250,SIENA,"Sobs with love, aching with sweet fear?"
5251,SIENA,What do ye here?
5252,SIENA,
5253,SIENA,"For the outer land is sad, and wears"
5254,SIENA,A raiment of a flaming fire;
5255,SIENA,And the fierce fruitless mountain stairs
5256,SIENA,"Climb, yet seem wroth and loth to aspire,"
5257,SIENA,"Climb, and break, and are broken down,"
5258,SIENA,And through their clefts and crests the town
5259,SIENA,"Looks west and sees the dead sun lie,"
5260,SIENA,In sanguine death that stains the sky
5261,SIENA,With angry dye.
5262,SIENA,
5263,SIENA,And from the war-worn wastes without
5264,SIENA,"In twilight, in the time of doubt,"
5265,SIENA,"One sound comes of one whisper, where"
5266,SIENA,Moved with low motions of slow air
5267,SIENA,The great trees nigh the castle swing
5268,SIENA,In the sad coloured evening;
5269,SIENA,"“_Ricorditi di me_, _che son_"
5270,SIENA,_La Pia_”—that small sweet word alone
5271,SIENA,Is not yet gone.
5272,SIENA,
5273,SIENA,“_Ricorditi di me_”—the sound
5274,SIENA,Sole out of deep dumb days remote
5275,SIENA,Across the fiery and fatal ground
5276,SIENA,Comes tender as a hurt bird’s note
5277,SIENA,"To where, a ghost with empty hands,"
5278,SIENA,"A woe-worn ghost, her palace stands"
5279,SIENA,"In the mid city, where the strong"
5280,SIENA,"Bells turn the sunset air to song,"
5281,SIENA,And the towers throng.
5282,SIENA,
5283,SIENA,"With other face, with speech the same,"
5284,SIENA,A mightier maiden’s likeness came
5285,SIENA,"Late among mourning men that slept,"
5286,SIENA,"A sacred ghost that went and wept,"
5287,SIENA,"White as the passion-wounded Lamb,"
5288,SIENA,"Saying, “Ah, remember me, that am"
5289,SIENA,Italia.”  (From deep sea to sea
5290,SIENA,"Earth heard, earth knew her, that this was she.)"
5291,SIENA,“_Ricorditi_.
5292,SIENA,
5293,SIENA,"“Love made me of all things fairest thing,"
5294,SIENA,And Hate unmade me; this knows he
5295,SIENA,Who with God’s sacerdotal ring
5296,SIENA,"Enringed mine hand, espousing me.”"
5297,SIENA,"Yea, in thy myriad-mooded woe,"
5298,SIENA,"Yea, Mother, hast thou not said so?"
5299,SIENA,"Have not our hearts within us stirred,"
5300,SIENA,"O thou most holiest, at thy word?"
5301,SIENA,Have we not heard?
5302,SIENA,
5303,SIENA,As this dead tragic land that she
5304,SIENA,"Found deadly, such was time to thee;"
5305,SIENA,Years passed thee withering in the red
5306,SIENA,"Maremma, years that deemed thee dead,"
5307,SIENA,Ages that sorrowed or that scorned;
5308,SIENA,And all this while though all they mourned
5309,SIENA,"Thou sawest the end of things unclean,"
5310,SIENA,And the unborn that should see thee a queen.
5311,SIENA,Have we not seen?
5312,SIENA,
5313,SIENA,"The weary poet, thy sad son,"
5314,SIENA,"Upon thy soil, under thy skies,"
5315,SIENA,Saw all Italian things save one—
5316,SIENA,Italia; this thing missed his eyes;
5317,SIENA,"The old mother-might, the breast, the face,"
5318,SIENA,"That reared, that lit the Roman race;"
5319,SIENA,"This not Leopardi saw; but we,"
5320,SIENA,"What is it, Mother, that we see,"
5321,SIENA,What if not thee?
5322,SIENA,
5323,SIENA,"Look thou from Siena southward home,"
5324,SIENA,"Where the priest’s pall hangs rent on Rome,"
5325,SIENA,And through the red rent swaddling-bands
5326,SIENA,Towards thine she strains her labouring hands.
5327,SIENA,"Look thou and listen, and let be"
5328,SIENA,"All the dead quick, all the bond free;"
5329,SIENA,In the blind eyes let there be sight;
5330,SIENA,In the eighteen centuries of the night
5331,SIENA,Let there be light.
5332,SIENA,
5333,SIENA,"Bow down the beauty of thine head,"
5334,SIENA,"Sweet, and with lips of living breath"
5335,SIENA,"Kiss thy sons sleeping and thy dead,"
5336,SIENA,That there be no more sleep or death.
5337,SIENA,"Give us thy light, thy might, thy love,"
5338,SIENA,Whom thy face seen afar above
5339,SIENA,"Drew to thy feet; and when, being free,"
5340,SIENA,"Thou hast blest thy children born to thee,"
5341,SIENA,Bless also me.
5342,SIENA,
5343,SIENA,Me that when others played or slept
5344,SIENA,Sat still under thy cross and wept;
5345,SIENA,Me who so early and unaware
5346,SIENA,Felt fall on bent bared brows and hair
5347,SIENA,(Thin drops of the overflowing flood!)
5348,SIENA,The bitter blessing of thy blood;
5349,SIENA,"The sacred shadow of thy pain,"
5350,SIENA,"Thine, the true maiden-mother, slain"
5351,SIENA,And raised again.
5352,SIENA,
5353,SIENA,"Me consecrated, if I might,"
5354,SIENA,"To praise thee, or to love at least,"
5355,SIENA,"O mother of all men’s dear delight,"
5356,SIENA,"Thou madest a choral-souled boy-priest,"
5357,SIENA,"Before my lips had leave to sing,"
5358,SIENA,Or my hands hardly strength to cling
5359,SIENA,About the intolerable tree
5360,SIENA,Whereto they had nailed my heart and thee
5361,SIENA,"And said, “Let be.”"
5362,SIENA,
5363,SIENA,For to thee too the high Fates gave
5364,SIENA,"Grace to be sacrificed and save,"
5365,SIENA,"That being arisen, in the equal sun,"
5366,SIENA,God and the People should be one;
5367,SIENA,"By those red roads thy footprints trod,"
5368,SIENA,"Man more divine, more human God,"
5369,SIENA,Saviour; that where no light was known
5370,SIENA,"But darkness, and a daytime flown,"
5371,SIENA,Light should be shown.
5372,SIENA,
5373,SIENA,"Let there be light, O Italy!"
5374,SIENA,For our feet falter in the night.
5375,SIENA,"O lamp of living years to be,"
5376,SIENA,"O light of God, let there be light!"
5377,SIENA,Fill with a love keener than flame
5378,SIENA,"Men sealed in spirit with thy name,"
5379,SIENA,"The cities and the Roman skies,"
5380,SIENA,Where men with other than man’s eyes
5381,SIENA,Saw thy sun rise.
5382,SIENA,
5383,SIENA,For theirs thou wast and thine were they
5384,SIENA,Whose names outshine thy very day;
5385,SIENA,For they are thine and theirs thou art
5386,SIENA,"Whose blood beats living in man’s heart,"
5387,SIENA,Remembering ages fled and dead
5388,SIENA,Wherein for thy sake these men bled;
5389,SIENA,"They that saw Trebia, they that see"
5390,SIENA,"Mentana, they in years to be"
5391,SIENA,That shall see thee.
5392,SIENA,
5393,SIENA,"For thine are all of us, and ours"
5394,SIENA,Thou; till the seasons bring to birth
5395,SIENA,"A perfect people, and all the powers"
5396,SIENA,Be with them that bear fruit on earth;
5397,SIENA,Till the inner heart of man be one
5398,SIENA,"With freedom, and the sovereign sun;"
5399,SIENA,"And Time, in likeness of a guide,"
5400,SIENA,Lead the Republic as a bride
5401,SIENA,Up to God’s side.

5455,PART I,Set in mine hand my staff and leave me here
5456,PART I,"Outside the hollow house that blind men fear,"
5457,PART I,More blind than I who live on life withdrawn
5458,PART I,And feel on eyes that see not but foresee
5459,PART I,The shadow of death which clothes Antigone.
5460,PART I,
5461,PART I,Here lay her living body that here lies
5462,PART I,"Dead, if man living know what thing is death,"
5463,PART I,"If life be all made up of blood and breath,"
5464,PART I,And no sense be save as of ears and eyes.
5465,PART I,"But heart there is not, tongue there is not found,"
5466,PART I,To think or sing what verge hath life or bound.
5467,PART I,
5468,PART I,In the beginning when the powers that made
5469,PART I,"The young child man a little loved him, seeing"
5470,PART I,"His joy of life and fair face of his being,"
5471,PART I,"And bland and laughing with the man-child played,"
5472,PART I,As friends they saw on our divine one day
5473,PART I,King Cadmus take to queen Harmonia.
5474,PART I,
5475,PART I,The strength of soul that builds up as with hands
5476,PART I,Walls spiritual and towers and towns of thought
5477,PART I,"Which only fate, not force, can bring to nought,"
5478,PART I,"Took then to wife the light of all men’s lands,"
5479,PART I,"War’s child and love’s, most sweet and wise and strong,"
5480,PART I,Order of things and rule and guiding song.
5481,PART I,
5482,PART I,"It was long since: yea, even the sun that saw"
5483,PART I,"Remembers hardly what was, nor how long."
5484,PART I,And now the wise heart of the worldly song
5485,PART I,"Is perished, and the holy hand of law"
5486,PART I,"Can set no tune on time, nor help again"
5487,PART I,The power of thought to build up life for men.
5488,PART I,
5489,PART I,"Yea, surely are they now transformed or dead,"
5490,PART I,"And sleep below this world, where no sun warms,"
5491,PART I,Or move about it now in formless forms
5492,PART I,"Incognizable, and all their lordship fled;"
5493,PART I,"And where they stood up singing crawl and hiss,"
5494,PART I,With fangs that kill behind their lips that kiss.
5495,PART I,
5496,PART I,"Yet though her marriage-garment, seeming fair,"
5497,PART I,Was dyed in sin and woven of jealousy
5498,PART I,"To turn their seed to poison, time shall see"
5499,PART I,"The gods reissue from them, and repair"
5500,PART I,"Their broken stamp of godhead, and again"
5501,PART I,Thought and wise love sing words of law to men.
5502,PART I,
5503,PART I,"I, Tiresias the prophet, seeing in Thebes"
5504,PART I,"Much evil, and the misery of men’s hands"
5505,PART I,"Who sow with fruitless wheat the stones and sands,"
5506,PART I,"With fruitful thorns the fallows and warm glebes,"
5507,PART I,Bade their hands hold lest worse hap came to pass;
5508,PART I,But which of you had heed of Tiresias?
5509,PART I,
5510,PART I,"I am as Time’s self in mine own wearied mind,"
5511,PART I,Whom the strong heavy-footed years have led
5512,PART I,"From night to night and dead men unto dead,"
5513,PART I,And from the blind hope to the memory blind;
5514,PART I,"For each man’s life is woven, as Time’s life is,"
5515,PART I,Of blind young hopes and old blind memories.
5516,PART I,
5517,PART I,I am a soul outside of death and birth.
5518,PART I,"I see before me and afterward I see,"
5519,PART I,"O child, O corpse, the live dead face of thee,"
5520,PART I,Whose life and death are one thing upon earth
5521,PART I,Where day kills night and night again kills day
5522,PART I,And dies; but where is that Harmonia?
5523,PART I,
5524,PART I,"O all-beholden light not seen of me,"
5525,PART I,"Air, and warm winds that under the sun’s eye"
5526,PART I,"Stretch your strong wings at morning; and thou, sky,"
5527,PART I,Whose hollow circle engirdling earth and sea
5528,PART I,"All night the set stars limit, and all day"
5529,PART I,"The moving sun remeasures; ye, I say,"
5530,PART I,
5531,PART I,"Ye heights of hills, and thou Dircean spring"
5532,PART I,"Inviolable, and ye towers that saw cast down"
5533,PART I,Seven kings keen-sighted toward your seven-faced town
5534,PART I,And quenched the red seed of one sightless king;
5535,PART I,"And thou, for death less dreadful than for birth,"
5536,PART I,"Whose wild leaves hide the horror of the earth,"
5537,PART I,
5538,PART I,"O mountain whereon gods made chase of kings,"
5539,PART I,"Cithæron, thou that sawest on Pentheus dead"
5540,PART I,Fangs of a mother fasten and wax red
5541,PART I,"And satiate with a son thy swollen springs,"
5542,PART I,And heardst her cry fright all thine eyries’ nests
5543,PART I,Who gave death suck at sanguine-suckling breasts;
5544,PART I,
5545,PART I,"Yea, and a grief more grievous, without name,"
5546,PART I,"A curse too grievous for the name of grief,"
5547,PART I,"Thou sawest, and heardst the rumour scare belief"
5548,PART I,"Even unto death and madness, when the flame"
5549,PART I,Was lit whose ashes dropped about the pyre
5550,PART I,That of two brethren made one sundering fire;
5551,PART I,
5552,PART I,"O bitter nurse, that on thine hard bare knees"
5553,PART I,Rear’dst for his fate the bloody-footed child
5554,PART I,Whose hands should be more bloodily defiled
5555,PART I,"And the old blind feet walk wearier ways than these,"
5556,PART I,"Whose seed, brought forth in darkness unto doom,"
5557,PART I,Should break as fire out of his mother’s womb;
5558,PART I,
5559,PART I,"I bear you witness as ye bear to me,"
5560,PART I,"Time, day, night, sun, stars, life, death, air, sea, earth,"
5561,PART I,And ye that round the human house of birth
5562,PART I,"Watch with veiled heads and weaponed hands, and see"
5563,PART I,"Good things and evil, strengthless yet and dumb,"
5564,PART I,Sit in the clouds with cloudlike hours to come;
5565,PART I,
5566,PART I,Ye forces without form and viewless powers
5567,PART I,"That have the keys of all our years in hold,"
5568,PART I,"That prophesy too late with tongues of gold,"
5569,PART I,"In a strange speech whose words are perished hours,"
5570,PART I,I witness to you what good things ye give
5571,PART I,As ye to me what evil while I live.
5572,PART I,
5573,PART I,"What should I do to blame you, what to praise,"
5574,PART I,For floral hours and hours funereal?
5575,PART I,What should I do to curse or bless at all
5576,PART I,For winter-woven or summer-coloured days?
5577,PART I,"Curse he that will and bless you whoso can,"
5578,PART I,I have no common part in you with man.
5579,PART I,
5580,PART I,"I hear a springing water, whose quick sound"
5581,PART I,"Makes softer the soft sunless patient air,"
5582,PART I,And the wind’s hand is laid on my thin hair
5583,PART I,"Light as a lover’s, and the grasses round"
5584,PART I,Have odours in them of green bloom and rain
5585,PART I,Sweet as the kiss wherewith sleep kisses pain.
5586,PART I,
5587,PART I,I hear the low sound of the spring of time
5588,PART I,"Still beating as the low live throb of blood,"
5589,PART I,And where its waters gather head and flood
5590,PART I,"I hear change moving on them, and the chime"
5591,PART I,Across them of reverberate wings of hours
5592,PART I,"Sounding, and feel the future air of flowers."
5593,PART I,
5594,PART I,"The wind of change is soft as snow, and sweet"
5595,PART I,"The sense thereof as roses in the sun,"
5596,PART I,"The faint wind springing with the springs that run,"
5597,PART I,"The dim sweet smell of flowering hopes, and heat"
5598,PART I,Of unbeholden sunrise; yet how long
5599,PART I,"I know not, till the morning put forth song."
5600,PART I,
5601,PART I,"I prophesy of life, who live with death;"
5602,PART I,"Of joy, being sad; of sunlight, who am blind;"
5603,PART I,"Of man, whose ways are alien from mankind"
5604,PART I,And his lips are not parted with man’s breath;
5605,PART I,"I am a word out of the speechless years,"
5606,PART I,"The tongue of time, that no man sleeps who hears."
5607,PART I,
5608,PART I,"I stand a shadow across the door of doom,"
5609,PART I,"Athwart the lintel of death’s house, and wait;"
5610,PART I,"Nor quick nor dead, nor flexible by fate,"
5611,PART I,Nor quite of earth nor wholly of the tomb;
5612,PART I,"A voice, a vision, light as fire or air,"
5613,PART I,Driven between days that shall be and that were.
5614,PART I,
5615,PART I,"I prophesy, with feet upon a grave,"
5616,PART I,Of death cast out and life devouring death
5617,PART I,As flame doth wood and stubble with a breath;
5618,PART I,"Of freedom, though all manhood were one slave;"
5619,PART I,"Of truth, though all the world were liar; of love,"
5620,PART I,That time nor hate can raze the witness of.
5621,PART I,
5622,PART I,Life that was given for love’s sake and his law’s
5623,PART I,Their powers have no more power on; they divide
5624,PART I,"Spoils wrung from lust or wrath of man or pride,"
5625,PART I,And keen oblivion without pity or pause
5626,PART I,Sets them on fire and scatters them on air
5627,PART I,Like ashes shaken from a suppliant’s hair.
5628,PART I,
5629,PART I,But life they lay no hand on; life once given
5630,PART I,No force of theirs hath competence to take;
5631,PART I,"Life that was given for some divine thing’s sake,"
5632,PART I,"To mix the bitterness of earth with heaven,"
5633,PART I,"Light with man’s night, and music with his breath,"
5634,PART I,"Dies not, but makes its living food of death."
5635,PART I,
5636,PART I,"I have seen this, who live where men are not,"
5637,PART I,In the high starless air of fruitful night
5638,PART I,On that serenest and obscurest height
5639,PART I,Where dead and unborn things are one in thought
5640,PART I,And whence the live unconquerable springs
5641,PART I,Feed full of force the torrents of new things.
5642,PART I,
5643,PART I,"I have seen this, who saw long since, being man,"
5644,PART I,"As now I know not if indeed I be,"
5645,PART I,"The fair bare body of Wisdom, good to see"
5646,PART I,"And evil, whence my light and night began;"
5647,PART I,"Light on the goal and darkness on the way,"
5648,PART I,Light all through night and darkness all through day.
5649,PART I,
5650,PART I,"Mother, that by that Pegasean spring"
5651,PART I,"Didst fold round in thine arms thy blinded son,"
5652,PART I,"Weeping “O holiest, what thing hast thou done,"
5653,PART I,"What, to my child? woe’s me that see the thing!"
5654,PART I,"Is this thy love to me-ward, and hereof"
5655,PART I,Must I take sample how the gods can love?
5656,PART I,
5657,PART I,"“O child, thou hast seen indeed, poor child of mine,"
5658,PART I,"The breasts and flanks of Pallas bare in sight,"
5659,PART I,But never shalt see more the dear sun’s light;
5660,PART I,"O Helicon, how great a pay is thine"
5661,PART I,"For some poor antelopes and wild-deer dead,"
5662,PART I,My child’s eyes hast thou taken in their stead—”
5663,PART I,
5664,PART I,"Mother, thou knewest not what she had to give,"
5665,PART I,"Thy goddess, though then angered, for mine eyes;"
5666,PART I,"Fame and foreknowledge, and to be most wise,"
5667,PART I,"And centuries of high-thoughted life to live,"
5668,PART I,And in mine hand this guiding staff to be
5669,PART I,As eyesight to the feet of men that see.
5670,PART I,
5671,PART I,"Perchance I shall not die at all, nor pass"
5672,PART I,The general door and lintel of men dead;
5673,PART I,Yet even the very tongue of wisdom said
5674,PART I,"What grace should come with death to Tiresias,"
5675,PART I,What special honour that God’s hand accord
5676,PART I,Who gathers all men’s nations as their lord.
5677,PART I,
5678,PART I,And sometimes when the secret eye of thought
5679,PART I,"Is changed with obscuration, and the sense"
5680,PART I,"Aches with long pain of hollow prescience,"
5681,PART I,And fiery foresight with foresuffering bought
5682,PART I,"Seems even to infect my spirit and consume,"
5683,PART I,Hunger and thirst come on me for the tomb.
5684,PART I,
5685,PART I,"I could be fain to drink my death and sleep,"
5686,PART I,And no more wrapped about with bitter dreams
5687,PART I,Talk with the stars and with the winds and streams
5688,PART I,"And with the inevitable years, and weep;"
5689,PART I,For how should he who communes with the years
5690,PART I,Be sometime not a living spring of tears?
5691,PART I,
5692,PART I,"O child, that guided of thine only will"
5693,PART I,Didst set thy maiden foot against the gate
5694,PART I,"To strike it open ere thine hour of fate,"
5695,PART I,"Antigone, men say not thou didst ill,"
5696,PART I,For love’s sake and the reverence of his awe
5697,PART I,"Divinely dying, slain by mortal law;"
5698,PART I,
5699,PART I,For love is awful as immortal death.
5700,PART I,And through thee surely hath thy brother won
5701,PART I,"Rest, out of sight of our world-weary sun,"
5702,PART I,And in the dead land where ye ghosts draw breath
5703,PART I,A royal place and honour; so wast thou
5704,PART I,"Happy, though earth have hold of thee too now."
5705,PART I,
5706,PART I,So hast thou life and name inviolable
5707,PART I,"And joy it may be, sacred and severe,"
5708,PART I,"Joy secret-souled beyond all hope or fear,"
5709,PART I,A monumental joy wherein to dwell
5710,PART I,"Secluse and silent, a selected state,"
5711,PART I,Serene possession of thy proper fate.
5712,PART I,
5713,PART I,Thou art not dead as these are dead who live
5714,PART I,"Full of blind years, a sorrow-shaken kind,"
5715,PART I,Nor as these are am I the prophet blind;
5716,PART I,They have not life that have not heart to give
5717,PART I,"Life, nor have eyesight who lack heart to see"
5718,PART I,When to be not is better than to be.
5719,PART I,
5720,PART I,"O ye whom time but bears with for a span,"
5721,PART I,"How long will ye be blind and dead, how long"
5722,PART I,Make your own souls part of your own soul’s wrong?
5723,PART I,"Son of the word of the most high gods, man,"
5724,PART I,Why wilt thou make thine hour of light and breath
5725,PART I,Emptier of all but shame than very death?
5726,PART I,
5727,PART I,"Fool, wilt thou live for ever? though thou care"
5728,PART I,"With all thine heart for life to keep it fast,"
5729,PART I,Shall not thine hand forego it at the last?
5730,PART I,"Lo, thy sure hour shall take thee by the hair"
5731,PART I,"Sleeping, or when thou knowest not, or wouldst fly;"
5732,PART I,And as men died much mightier shalt thou die.
5733,PART I,
5734,PART I,"Yea, they are dead, men much more worth than thou;"
5735,PART I,"The savour of heroic lives that were,"
5736,PART I,Is it not mixed into thy common air?
5737,PART I,The sense of them is shed about thee now:
5738,PART I,Feel not thy brows a wind blowing from far?
5739,PART I,Aches not thy forehead with a future star?
5740,PART I,
5741,PART I,The light that thou may’st make out of thy name
5742,PART I,"Is in the wind of this same hour that drives,"
5743,PART I,Blown within reach but once of all men’s lives;
5744,PART I,And he that puts forth hand upon the flame
5745,PART I,Shall have it for a garland on his head
5746,PART I,To sign him for a king among the dead.
5747,PART I,
5748,PART I,"But these men that the lessening years behold,"
5749,PART I,"Who sit the most part without flame or crown,"
5750,PART I,And brawl and sleep and wear their life-days down
5751,PART I,"With joys and griefs ignobler than of old,"
5752,PART I,And care not if the better day shall be—
5753,PART I,"Are these or art thou dead, Antigone?"
5754,PART I,
5755,PART II,PART II
5756,PART II,
5757,PART II,As when one wakes out of a waning dream
5758,PART II,And sees with instant eyes the naked thought
5759,PART II,"Whereof the vision as a web was wrought,"
5760,PART II,"I saw beneath a heaven of cloud and gleam,"
5761,PART II,"Ere yet the heart of the young sun waxed brave,"
5762,PART II,One like a prophet standing by a grave.
5763,PART II,
5764,PART II,"In the hoar heaven was hardly beam or breath,"
5765,PART II,"And all the coloured hills and fields were grey,"
5766,PART II,"And the wind wandered seeking for the day,"
5767,PART II,And wailed as though he had found her done to death
5768,PART II,And this grey hour had built to bury her
5769,PART II,The hollow twilight for a sepulchre.
5770,PART II,
5771,PART II,But in my soul I saw as in a glass
5772,PART II,A pale and living body full of grace
5773,PART II,"There lying, and over it the prophet’s face"
5774,PART II,"Fixed; and the face was not of Tiresias,"
5775,PART II,For such a starry fire was in his eyes
5776,PART II,As though their light it was that made the skies.
5777,PART II,
5778,PART II,Such eyes should God’s have been when very love
5779,PART II,"Looked forth of them and set the sun aflame,"
5780,PART II,And such his lips that called the light by name
5781,PART II,And bade the morning forth at sound thereof;
5782,PART II,"His face was sad and masterful as fate,"
5783,PART II,And like a star’s his look compassionate.
5784,PART II,
5785,PART II,Like a star’s gazed on of sad eyes so long
5786,PART II,"It seems to yearn with pity, and all its fire"
5787,PART II,As a man’s heart to tremble with desire
5788,PART II,And heave as though the light would bring forth song;
5789,PART II,"Yet from his face flashed lightning on the land,"
5790,PART II,And like the thunder-bearer’s was his hand.
5791,PART II,
5792,PART II,"The steepness of strange stairs had tired his feet,"
5793,PART II,And his lips yet seemed sick of that salt bread
5794,PART II,Wherewith the lips of banishment are fed;
5795,PART II,But nothing was there in the world so sweet
5796,PART II,"As the most bitter love, like God’s own grace,"
5797,PART II,Wherewith he gazed on that fair buried face.
5798,PART II,
5799,PART II,"Grief and glad pride and passion and sharp shame,"
5800,PART II,"Wrath and remembrance, faith and hope and hate"
5801,PART II,"And pitiless pity of days degenerate,"
5802,PART II,Were in his eyes as an incorporate flame
5803,PART II,"That burned about her, and the heart thereof"
5804,PART II,And central flower was very fire of love.
5805,PART II,
5806,PART II,But all about her grave wherein she slept
5807,PART II,Were noises of the wild wind-footed years
5808,PART II,"Whose footprints flying were full of blood and tears,"
5809,PART II,Shrieks as of Mænads on their hills that leapt
5810,PART II,"And yelled as beasts of ravin, and their meat"
5811,PART II,Was the rent flesh of their own sons to eat:
5812,PART II,
5813,PART II,"And fiery shadows passing with strange cries,"
5814,PART II,"And Sphinx-like shapes about the ruined lands,"
5815,PART II,And the red reek of parricidal hands
5816,PART II,"And intermixture of incestuous eyes,"
5817,PART II,And light as of that self-divided flame
5818,PART II,Which made an end of the Cadmean name.
5819,PART II,
5820,PART II,"And I beheld again, and lo the grave,"
5821,PART II,"And the bright body laid therein as dead,"
5822,PART II,And the same shadow across another head
5823,PART II,That bowed down silent on that sleeping slave
5824,PART II,Who was the lady of empire from her birth
5825,PART II,And light of all the kingdoms of the earth.
5826,PART II,
5827,PART II,Within the compass of the watcher’s hand
5828,PART II,All strengths of other men and divers powers
5829,PART II,Were held at ease and gathered up as flowers;
5830,PART II,"His heart was as the heart of his whole land,"
5831,PART II,And at his feet as natural servants lay
5832,PART II,Twilight and dawn and night and labouring day.
5833,PART II,
5834,PART II,He was most awful of the sons of God.
5835,PART II,Even now men seeing seemed at his lips to see
5836,PART II,"The trumpet of the judgment that should be,"
5837,PART II,"And in his right hand terror for a rod,"
5838,PART II,And in the breath that made the mountains bow
5839,PART II,The horned fire of Moses on his brow.
5840,PART II,
5841,PART II,The strong wind of the coming of the Lord
5842,PART II,"Had blown as flame upon him, and brought down"
5843,PART II,"On his bare head from heaven fire for a crown,"
5844,PART II,And fire was girt upon him as a sword
5845,PART II,"To smite and lighten, and on what ways he trod"
5846,PART II,There fell from him the shadow of a God.
5847,PART II,
5848,PART II,"Pale, with the whole world’s judgment in his eyes,"
5849,PART II,He stood and saw the grief and shame endure
5850,PART II,"That he, though highest of angels might not cure,"
5851,PART II,"And the same sins done under the same skies,"
5852,PART II,"And the same slaves to the same tyrants thrown,"
5853,PART II,"And fain he would have slept, and fain been stone."
5854,PART II,
5855,PART II,But with unslumbering eyes he watched the sleep
5856,PART II,That sealed her sense whose eyes were suns of old;
5857,PART II,"And the night shut and opened, and behold,"
5858,PART II,"The same grave where those prophets came to weep,"
5859,PART II,"But she that lay therein had moved and stirred,"
5860,PART II,And where those twain had watched her stood a third.
5861,PART II,
5862,PART II,The tripled rhyme that closed in Paradise
5863,PART II,With Love’s name sealing up its starry speech—
5864,PART II,The tripled might of hand that found in reach
5865,PART II,"All crowns beheld far off of all men’s eyes,"
5866,PART II,"Song, colour, carven wonders of live stone—"
5867,PART II,"These were not, but the very soul alone."
5868,PART II,
5869,PART II,"The living spirit, the good gift of grace,"
5870,PART II,The faith which takes of its own blood to give
5871,PART II,"That the dead veins of buried hope may live,"
5872,PART II,"Came on her sleeping, face to naked face,"
5873,PART II,And from a soul more sweet than all the south
5874,PART II,Breathed love upon her sealed and breathless mouth.
5875,PART II,
5876,PART II,"Between her lips the breath was blown as fire,"
5877,PART II,"And through her flushed veins leapt the liquid life,"
5878,PART II,And with sore passion and ambiguous strife
5879,PART II,"The new birth rent her and the new desire,"
5880,PART II,"The will to live, the competence to be,"
5881,PART II,The sense to hearken and the soul to see.
5882,PART II,
5883,PART II,And the third prophet standing by her grave
5884,PART II,"Stretched forth his hand and touched her, and her eyes"
5885,PART II,"Opened as sudden suns in heaven might rise,"
5886,PART II,And her soul caught from his the faith to save;
5887,PART II,"Faith above creeds, faith beyond records, born"
5888,PART II,"Of the pure, naked, fruitful, awful morn."
5889,PART II,
5890,PART II,For in the daybreak now that night was dead
5891,PART II,"The light, the shadow, the delight, the pain,"
5892,PART II,"The purpose and the passion of those twain,"
5893,PART II,"Seemed gathered on that third prophetic head,"
5894,PART II,"And all their crowns were as one crown, and one"
5895,PART II,His face with her face in the living sun.
5896,PART II,
5897,PART II,For even with that communion of their eyes
5898,PART II,His whole soul passed into her and made her strong;
5899,PART II,"And all the sounds and shows of shame and wrong,"
5900,PART II,"The hand that slays, the lip that mocks and lies,"
5901,PART II,Temples and thrones that yet men seem to see—
5902,PART II,"Are these dead or art thou dead, Italy?"

5993,ON THE DOWNS,A FAINT sea without wind or sun;
5994,ON THE DOWNS,A sky like flameless vapour dun;
5995,ON THE DOWNS,A valley like an unsealed grave
5996,ON THE DOWNS,"That no man cares to weep upon,"
5997,ON THE DOWNS,"Bare, without boon to crave,"
5998,ON THE DOWNS,Or flower to save.
5999,ON THE DOWNS,
6000,ON THE DOWNS,"And on the lip’s edge of the down,"
6001,ON THE DOWNS,Here where the bent-grass burns to brown
6002,ON THE DOWNS,"In the dry sea-wind, and the heath"
6003,ON THE DOWNS,"Crawls to the cliff-side and looks down,"
6004,ON THE DOWNS,"I watch, and hear beneath"
6005,ON THE DOWNS,The low tide breathe.
6006,ON THE DOWNS,
6007,ON THE DOWNS,"Along the long lines of the cliff,"
6008,ON THE DOWNS,Down the flat sea-line without skiff
6009,ON THE DOWNS,"Or sail or back-blown fume for mark,"
6010,ON THE DOWNS,Through wind-worn heads of heath and stiff
6011,ON THE DOWNS,Stems blossomless and stark
6012,ON THE DOWNS,"With dry sprays dark,"
6013,ON THE DOWNS,
6014,ON THE DOWNS,I send mine eyes out as for news
6015,ON THE DOWNS,"Of comfort that all these refuse,"
6016,ON THE DOWNS,Tidings of light or living air
6017,ON THE DOWNS,From windward where the low clouds muse
6018,ON THE DOWNS,And the sea blind and bare
6019,ON THE DOWNS,Seems full of care.
6020,ON THE DOWNS,
6021,ON THE DOWNS,"So is it now as it was then,"
6022,ON THE DOWNS,And as men have been such are men.
6023,ON THE DOWNS,"There as I stood I seem to stand,"
6024,ON THE DOWNS,"Here sitting chambered, and again"
6025,ON THE DOWNS,Feel spread on either hand
6026,ON THE DOWNS,"Sky, sea, and land."
6027,ON THE DOWNS,
6028,ON THE DOWNS,As a queen taken and stripped and bound
6029,ON THE DOWNS,"Sat earth, discoloured and discrowned;"
6030,ON THE DOWNS,As a king’s palace empty and dead
6031,ON THE DOWNS,"The sky was, without light or sound;"
6032,ON THE DOWNS,And on the summer’s head
6033,ON THE DOWNS,Were ashes shed.
6034,ON THE DOWNS,
6035,ON THE DOWNS,"Scarce wind enough was on the sea,"
6036,ON THE DOWNS,"Scarce hope enough there moved in me,"
6037,ON THE DOWNS,To sow with live blown flowers of white
6038,ON THE DOWNS,"The green plain’s sad serenity,"
6039,ON THE DOWNS,Or with stray thoughts of light
6040,ON THE DOWNS,Touch my soul’s sight.
6041,ON THE DOWNS,
6042,ON THE DOWNS,By footless ways and sterile went
6043,ON THE DOWNS,"My thought unsatisfied, and bent"
6044,ON THE DOWNS,With blank unspeculative eyes
6045,ON THE DOWNS,On the untracked sands of discontent
6046,ON THE DOWNS,"Where, watched of helpless skies,"
6047,ON THE DOWNS,Life hopeless lies.
6048,ON THE DOWNS,
6049,ON THE DOWNS,East and west went my soul to find
6050,ON THE DOWNS,"Light, and the world was bare and blind"
6051,ON THE DOWNS,And the soil herbless where she trod
6052,ON THE DOWNS,"And saw men laughing scourge mankind,"
6053,ON THE DOWNS,Unsmitten by the rod
6054,ON THE DOWNS,Of any God.
6055,ON THE DOWNS,
6056,ON THE DOWNS,Out of time’s blind old eyes were shed
6057,ON THE DOWNS,"Tears that were mortal, and left dead"
6058,ON THE DOWNS,"The heart and spirit of the years,"
6059,ON THE DOWNS,And on mans fallen and helmless head
6060,ON THE DOWNS,Time’s disanointing tears
6061,ON THE DOWNS,Fell cold as fears.
6062,ON THE DOWNS,
6063,ON THE DOWNS,Hope flowering had but strength to bear
6064,ON THE DOWNS,The fruitless fruitage of despair;
6065,ON THE DOWNS,"Grief trod the grapes of joy for wine,"
6066,ON THE DOWNS,Whereof love drinking unaware
6067,ON THE DOWNS,Died as one undivine
6068,ON THE DOWNS,And made no sign.
6069,ON THE DOWNS,
6070,ON THE DOWNS,And soul and body dwelt apart;
6071,ON THE DOWNS,And weary wisdom without heart
6072,ON THE DOWNS,"Stared on the dead round heaven and sighed,"
6073,ON THE DOWNS,"“Is death too hollow as thou art,"
6074,ON THE DOWNS,Or as man’s living pride?”
6075,ON THE DOWNS,And saying so died.
6076,ON THE DOWNS,
6077,ON THE DOWNS,And my soul heard the songs and groans
6078,ON THE DOWNS,"That are about and under thrones,"
6079,ON THE DOWNS,And felt through all time’s murmur thrill
6080,ON THE DOWNS,Fate’s old imperious semitones
6081,ON THE DOWNS,That made of good and ill
6082,ON THE DOWNS,One same tune still.
6083,ON THE DOWNS,
6084,ON THE DOWNS,Then “Where is God? and where is aid?
6085,ON THE DOWNS,Or what good end of these?” she said;
6086,ON THE DOWNS,"“Is there no God or end at all,"
6087,ON THE DOWNS,"Nor reason with unreason weighed,"
6088,ON THE DOWNS,Nor force to disenthral
6089,ON THE DOWNS,Weak feet that fall?
6090,ON THE DOWNS,
6091,ON THE DOWNS,“No light to lighten and no rod
6092,ON THE DOWNS,To chasten men?  Is there no God?”
6093,ON THE DOWNS,"So girt with anguish, iron-zoned,"
6094,ON THE DOWNS,Went my soul weeping as she trod
6095,ON THE DOWNS,Between the men enthroned
6096,ON THE DOWNS,And men that groaned.
6097,ON THE DOWNS,
6098,ON THE DOWNS,"O fool, that for brute cries of wrong"
6099,ON THE DOWNS,Heard not the grey glad mother’s song
6100,ON THE DOWNS,"Ring response from the hills and waves,"
6101,ON THE DOWNS,But heard harsh noises all day long
6102,ON THE DOWNS,Of spirits that were slaves
6103,ON THE DOWNS,And dwelt in graves.
6104,ON THE DOWNS,
6105,ON THE DOWNS,The wise word of the secret earth
6106,ON THE DOWNS,"Who knows what life and death are worth,"
6107,ON THE DOWNS,And how no help and no control
6108,ON THE DOWNS,"Can speed or stay things come to birth,"
6109,ON THE DOWNS,Nor all worlds’ wheels that roll
6110,ON THE DOWNS,Crush one born soul.
6111,ON THE DOWNS,
6112,ON THE DOWNS,"With all her tongues of life and death,"
6113,ON THE DOWNS,"With all her bloom and blood and breath,"
6114,ON THE DOWNS,"From all years dead and all things done,"
6115,ON THE DOWNS,"In the ear of man the mother saith,"
6116,ON THE DOWNS,"“There is no God, O son,"
6117,ON THE DOWNS,If thou be none.”
6118,ON THE DOWNS,
6119,ON THE DOWNS,So my soul sick with watching heard
6120,ON THE DOWNS,"That day the wonder of that word,"
6121,ON THE DOWNS,And as one springs out of a dream
6122,ON THE DOWNS,"Sprang, and the stagnant wells were stirred"
6123,ON THE DOWNS,Whence flows through gloom and gleam
6124,ON THE DOWNS,Thought’s soundless stream.
6125,ON THE DOWNS,
6126,ON THE DOWNS,"Out of pale cliff and sunburnt health,"
6127,ON THE DOWNS,Out of the low sea curled beneath
6128,ON THE DOWNS,"In the land’s bending arm embayed,"
6129,ON THE DOWNS,Out of all lives that thought hears breathe
6130,ON THE DOWNS,"Life within life inlaid,"
6131,ON THE DOWNS,Was answer made.
6132,ON THE DOWNS,
6133,ON THE DOWNS,A multitudinous monotone
6134,ON THE DOWNS,"Of dust and flower and seed and stone,"
6135,ON THE DOWNS,"In the deep sea-rock’s mid-sea sloth,"
6136,ON THE DOWNS,"In the live water’s trembling zone,"
6137,ON THE DOWNS,"In all men love and loathe,"
6138,ON THE DOWNS,One God at growth.
6139,ON THE DOWNS,
6140,ON THE DOWNS,One forceful nature uncreate
6141,ON THE DOWNS,"That feeds itself with death and fate,"
6142,ON THE DOWNS,"Evil and good, and change and time,"
6143,ON THE DOWNS,That within all men lies at wait
6144,ON THE DOWNS,Till the hour shall bid them climb
6145,ON THE DOWNS,And live sublime.
6146,ON THE DOWNS,
6147,ON THE DOWNS,For all things come by fate to flower
6148,ON THE DOWNS,"At their unconquerable hour,"
6149,ON THE DOWNS,"And time brings truth, and truth makes free,"
6150,ON THE DOWNS,"And freedom fills time’s veins with power,"
6151,ON THE DOWNS,"As, brooding on that sea,"
6152,ON THE DOWNS,My thought filled me.
6153,ON THE DOWNS,
6154,ON THE DOWNS,"And the sun smote the clouds and slew,"
6155,ON THE DOWNS,"And from the sun the sea’s breath blew,"
6156,ON THE DOWNS,And white waves laughed and turned and fled
6157,ON THE DOWNS,"The long green heaving sea-field through,"
6158,ON THE DOWNS,And on them overhead
6159,ON THE DOWNS,The sky burnt red
6160,ON THE DOWNS,
6161,ON THE DOWNS,"Like a furled flag that wind sets free,"
6162,ON THE DOWNS,On the swift summer-coloured sea
6163,ON THE DOWNS,"Shook out the red lines of the light,"
6164,ON THE DOWNS,"The live sun’s standard, blown to lee"
6165,ON THE DOWNS,Across the live sea’s white
6166,ON THE DOWNS,And green delight.
6167,ON THE DOWNS,
6168,ON THE DOWNS,And with divine triumphant awe
6169,ON THE DOWNS,"My spirit moved within me saw,"
6170,ON THE DOWNS,"With burning passion of stretched eyes,"
6171,ON THE DOWNS,"Clear as the light’s own firstborn law,"
6172,ON THE DOWNS,In windless wastes of skies
6173,ON THE DOWNS,Time’s deep dawn rise.

6191,MESSIDOR,"Coloured and clothed as the morn,"

6194,MESSIDOR,"In the mists of the day-dawn white,"
6195,MESSIDOR,"And the crescent, a faint sharp horn,"
6196,MESSIDOR,In the fear of his face turns cold
6197,MESSIDOR,As the snakes of the night-time that creep
6198,MESSIDOR,From the flag of our faith unrolled.

6211,MESSIDOR,Till the red-gold harvest-rows
6212,MESSIDOR,For miles through shudder and shine
6213,MESSIDOR,"In the wind’s breath, fed with the sun,"
6214,MESSIDOR,A thousand spear-heads as one
6215,MESSIDOR,Bowed as for battle to close
6216,MESSIDOR,Line in rank against line
6217,MESSIDOR,With place and station to keep
6218,MESSIDOR,Till all men’s hands at a sign
6219,MESSIDOR,Put in the sickles and reap.
6220,MESSIDOR,
6221,MESSIDOR,A thousand spear-heads as one
6222,MESSIDOR,Wave as with swing of the sea
6223,MESSIDOR,When the mid tide sways at its height;
6224,MESSIDOR,For the hour is for harvest or fight
6225,MESSIDOR,"In face of the just calm sun,"

6230,MESSIDOR,
6231,MESSIDOR,For the hour is for harvest or fight
6232,MESSIDOR,To clothe with raiment of red;
6233,MESSIDOR,"O men sore stricken of hours,"
6234,MESSIDOR,"Lo, this one, is not it ours"
6235,MESSIDOR,"To glean, to gather, to smite?"
6236,MESSIDOR,Let none make risk of his head
6237,MESSIDOR,"Within reach of the clean scythe-sweep,"
6238,MESSIDOR,When the people that lay as the dead
6239,MESSIDOR,Put in the sickles and reap.
6240,MESSIDOR,
6241,MESSIDOR,"Lo, this one, is not it ours,"
6242,MESSIDOR,Now the ruins of dead things rattle
6243,MESSIDOR,"As dead men’s bones in the pit,"
6244,MESSIDOR,Now the kings wax lean as they sit
6245,MESSIDOR,"Girt round with memories of powers,"

6255,MESSIDOR,"As corpses cast in a pit,"
6256,MESSIDOR,"Rise up with God at their hand,"

7129,A YEAR’S BURDEN,All souls of men in man’s one soul unite.
7130,A YEAR’S BURDEN,
7131,A YEAR’S BURDEN,"O sea whereon men labour, O great sea"
7132,A YEAR’S BURDEN,"That heaven seems one with, shall these things not be?"
7133,A YEAR’S BURDEN,"O earth, our earth, shall time not make us free?"
7134,A YEAR’S BURDEN,"Cry wellaway, but well befall the right."

7139,EPILOGUE,EPILOGUE
7140,EPILOGUE,
7141,EPILOGUE,
7142,EPILOGUE,BETWEEN the wave-ridge and the strand
7143,EPILOGUE,"I let you forth in sight of land,"
7144,EPILOGUE,Songs that with storm-crossed wings and eyes
7145,EPILOGUE,Strain eastward till the darkness dies;
7146,EPILOGUE,"Let signs and beacons fall or stand,"
7147,EPILOGUE,And stars and balefires set and rise;
7148,EPILOGUE,"Ye, till some lordlier lyric hand"
7149,EPILOGUE,"Weave the beloved brows their crown,"
7150,EPILOGUE,At the beloved feet lie down.
7151,EPILOGUE,
7152,EPILOGUE,"O, whatsoever of life or light"
7153,EPILOGUE,"Love hath to give you, what of might"
7154,EPILOGUE,"Or heart or hope is yours to live,"
7155,EPILOGUE,I charge you take in trust to give
7156,EPILOGUE,"For very love’s sake, in whose sight,"
7157,EPILOGUE,Through poise of hours alternative
7158,EPILOGUE,"And seasons plumed with light or night,"
7159,EPILOGUE,Ye live and move and have your breath
7160,EPILOGUE,To sing with on the ridge of death.
7161,EPILOGUE,
7162,EPILOGUE,I charge you faint not all night through
7163,EPILOGUE,For love’s sake that was breathed on you
7164,EPILOGUE,To be to you as wings and feet
7165,EPILOGUE,"For travel, and as blood to heat"
7166,EPILOGUE,And sense of spirit to renew
7167,EPILOGUE,And bloom of fragrance to keep sweet
7168,EPILOGUE,And fire of purpose to keep true
7169,EPILOGUE,"The life, if life in such things be,"
7170,EPILOGUE,That I would give you forth of me.
7171,EPILOGUE,
7172,EPILOGUE,"Out where the breath of war may bear,"
7173,EPILOGUE,Out in the rank moist reddened air
7174,EPILOGUE,"That sounds and smells of death, and hath"
7175,EPILOGUE,No light but death’s upon its path
7176,EPILOGUE,"Seen through the black wind’s tangled hair,"
7177,EPILOGUE,I send you past the wild time’s wrath
7178,EPILOGUE,To find his face who bade you bear
7179,EPILOGUE,"Fruit of his seed to faith and love,"
7180,EPILOGUE,That he may take the heart thereof.
7181,EPILOGUE,
7182,EPILOGUE,"By day or night, by sea or street,"
7183,EPILOGUE,Fly till ye find and clasp his feet
7184,EPILOGUE,And kiss as worshippers who bring
7185,EPILOGUE,"Too much love on their lips to sing,"
7186,EPILOGUE,But with hushed heads accept and greet
7187,EPILOGUE,The presence of some heavenlier thing
7188,EPILOGUE,In the near air; so may ye meet
7189,EPILOGUE,"His eyes, and droop not utterly"
7190,EPILOGUE,For shame’s sake at the light you see.
7191,EPILOGUE,
7192,EPILOGUE,Not utterly struck spiritless
7193,EPILOGUE,For shame’s sake and unworthiness
7194,EPILOGUE,Of these poor forceless hands that come
7195,EPILOGUE,"Empty, these lips that should be dumb,"
7196,EPILOGUE,This love whose seal can but impress
7197,EPILOGUE,These weak word-offerings wearisome
7198,EPILOGUE,Whose blessings have not strength to bless
7199,EPILOGUE,Nor lightnings fire to burn up aught
7200,EPILOGUE,Nor smite with thunders of their thought.
7201,EPILOGUE,
7202,EPILOGUE,"One thought they have, even love; one light,"
7203,EPILOGUE,"Truth, that keeps clear the sun by night;"
7204,EPILOGUE,"One chord, of faith as of a lyre;"
7205,EPILOGUE,"One heat, of hope as of a fire;"
7206,EPILOGUE,"One heart, one music, and one might,"
7207,EPILOGUE,"One flame, one altar, and one choir;"
7208,EPILOGUE,And one man’s living head in sight
7209,EPILOGUE,"Who said, when all time’s sea was foam,"
7210,EPILOGUE,“Let there be Rome”—and there was Rome.
7211,EPILOGUE,
7212,EPILOGUE,As a star set in space for token
7213,EPILOGUE,"Like a live word of God’s mouth spoken,"
7214,EPILOGUE,"Visible sound, light audible,"
7215,EPILOGUE,In the great darkness thick as hell
7216,EPILOGUE,"A stanchless flame of love unsloken,"
7217,EPILOGUE,"A sign to conquer and compel,"
7218,EPILOGUE,A law to stand in heaven unbroken
7219,EPILOGUE,"Whereby the sun shines, and wherethrough"
7220,EPILOGUE,Time’s eldest empires are made new;
7221,EPILOGUE,
7222,EPILOGUE,So rose up on our generations
7223,EPILOGUE,"That light of the most ancient nations,"
7224,EPILOGUE,"Law, life, and light, on the world’s way,"
7225,EPILOGUE,"The very God of very day,"
7226,EPILOGUE,The sun-god; from their star-like stations
7227,EPILOGUE,Far down the night in disarray
7228,EPILOGUE,"Fled, crowned with fires of tribulations,"
7229,EPILOGUE,"The suns of sunless years, whose light"
7230,EPILOGUE,And life and law were of the night.
7231,EPILOGUE,
7232,EPILOGUE,The naked kingdoms quenched and stark
7233,EPILOGUE,"Drave with their dead things down the dark,"
7234,EPILOGUE,"Helmless; their whole world, throne by throne,"
7235,EPILOGUE,"Fell, and its whole heart turned to stone,"
7236,EPILOGUE,Hopeless; their hands that touched our ark
7237,EPILOGUE,"Withered; and lo, aloft, alone,"
7238,EPILOGUE,"On time’s white waters man’s one bark,"
7239,EPILOGUE,Where the red sundawn’s open eye
7240,EPILOGUE,Lit the soft gulf of low green sky.
7241,EPILOGUE,
7242,EPILOGUE,So for a season piloted
7243,EPILOGUE,"It sailed the sunlight, and struck red"
7244,EPILOGUE,With fire of dawn reverberate
7245,EPILOGUE,The wan face of incumbent fate
7246,EPILOGUE,That paused half pitying overhead
7247,EPILOGUE,And almost had foregone the freight
7248,EPILOGUE,Of those dark hours the next day bred
7249,EPILOGUE,"For shame, and almost had forsworn"
7250,EPILOGUE,Service of night for love of morn.
7251,EPILOGUE,
7252,EPILOGUE,"Then broke the whole night in one blow,"
7253,EPILOGUE,Thundering; then all hell with one throe
7254,EPILOGUE,"Heaved, and brought forth beneath the stroke"
7255,EPILOGUE,Death; and all dead things moved and woke
7256,EPILOGUE,"That the dawn’s arrows had brought low,"
7257,EPILOGUE,At the great sound of night that broke
7258,EPILOGUE,"Thundering, and all the old world-wide woe;"
7259,EPILOGUE,And under night’s loud-sounding dome
7260,EPILOGUE,"Men sought her, and she was not Rome."
7261,EPILOGUE,
7262,EPILOGUE,Still with blind hands and robes blood-wet
7263,EPILOGUE,"Night hangs on heaven, reluctant yet,"
7264,EPILOGUE,With black blood dripping from her eyes
7265,EPILOGUE,"On the soiled lintels of the skies,"
7266,EPILOGUE,"With brows and lips that thirst and threat,"
7267,EPILOGUE,"Heart-sick with fear lest the sun rise,"
7268,EPILOGUE,"And aching with her fires that set,"
7269,EPILOGUE,"And shuddering ere dawn bursts her bars,"
7270,EPILOGUE,Burns out with all her beaten stars.
7271,EPILOGUE,
7272,EPILOGUE,In this black wind of war they fly
7273,EPILOGUE,"Now, ere that hour be in the sky"
7274,EPILOGUE,"That brings back hope, and memory back,"
7275,EPILOGUE,And light and law to lands that lack;
7276,EPILOGUE,That spiritual sweet hour whereby
7277,EPILOGUE,The bloody-handed night and black
7278,EPILOGUE,Shall be cast out of heaven to die;
7279,EPILOGUE,"Kingdom by kingdom, crown by crown,"
7280,EPILOGUE,The fires of darkness are blown down.
7281,EPILOGUE,
7282,EPILOGUE,"Yet heavy, grievous yet the weight"
7283,EPILOGUE,Sits on us of imperfect fate.
7284,EPILOGUE,From wounds of other days and deeds
7285,EPILOGUE,Still this day’s breathing body bleeds;
7286,EPILOGUE,Still kings for fear and slaves for hate
7287,EPILOGUE,Sow lives of men on earth like seeds
7288,EPILOGUE,In the red soil they saturate;
7289,EPILOGUE,"And we, with faces eastward set,"
7290,EPILOGUE,Stand sightless of the morning yet.
7291,EPILOGUE,
7292,EPILOGUE,And many for pure sorrow’s sake
7293,EPILOGUE,Look back and stretch back hands to take
7294,EPILOGUE,"Gifts of night’s giving, ease and sleep,"
7295,EPILOGUE,"Flowers of night’s grafting, strong to steep"
7296,EPILOGUE,"The soul in dreams it will not break,"
7297,EPILOGUE,Songs of soft hours that sigh and sweep
7298,EPILOGUE,Its lifted eyelids nigh to wake
7299,EPILOGUE,With subtle plumes and lulling breath
7300,EPILOGUE,That soothe its weariness to death.
7301,EPILOGUE,
7302,EPILOGUE,"And many, called of hope and pride,"
7303,EPILOGUE,Fall ere the sunrise from our side.
7304,EPILOGUE,Fresh lights and rumours of fresh fames
7305,EPILOGUE,"That shift and veer by night like flames,"
7306,EPILOGUE,"Shouts and blown trumpets, ghosts that glide"
7307,EPILOGUE,"Calling, and hail them by dead names,"
7308,EPILOGUE,"Fears, angers, memories, dreams divide"
7309,EPILOGUE,"Spirit from spirit, and wear out"
7310,EPILOGUE,Strong hearts of men with hope and doubt.
7311,EPILOGUE,
7312,EPILOGUE,Till time beget and sorrow bear
7313,EPILOGUE,"The soul-sick eyeless child despair,"
7314,EPILOGUE,"That comes among us, mad and blind,"
7315,EPILOGUE,"With counsels of a broken mind,"
7316,EPILOGUE,"Tales of times dead and woes that were,"
7317,EPILOGUE,"And, prophesying against mankind,"
7318,EPILOGUE,Shakes out the horror of her hair
7319,EPILOGUE,To take the sunlight with its coils
7320,EPILOGUE,And hold the living soul in toils.
7321,EPILOGUE,
7322,EPILOGUE,By many ways of death and moods
7323,EPILOGUE,Souls pass into their servitudes.
7324,EPILOGUE,"Their young wings weaken, plume by plume"
7325,EPILOGUE,"Drops, and their eyelids gather gloom"
7326,EPILOGUE,"And close against man’s frauds and feuds,"
7327,EPILOGUE,And their tongues call they know not whom
7328,EPILOGUE,To help in their vicissitudes;
7329,EPILOGUE,"For many slaveries are, but one"
7330,EPILOGUE,"Liberty, single as the sun."
7331,EPILOGUE,
7332,EPILOGUE,"One light, one law, that burns up strife,"
7333,EPILOGUE,And one sufficiency of life.
7334,EPILOGUE,"Self-stablished, the sufficing soul"
7335,EPILOGUE,"Hears the loud wheels of changes roll,"
7336,EPILOGUE,"Sees against man man bare the knife,"
7337,EPILOGUE,"Sees the world severed, and is whole;"
7338,EPILOGUE,"Sees force take dowerless fraud to wife,"
7339,EPILOGUE,And fear from fraud’s incestuous bed
7340,EPILOGUE,Crawl forth and smite his father dead:
7341,EPILOGUE,
7342,EPILOGUE,"Sees death made drunk with war, sees time"
7343,EPILOGUE,"Weave many-coloured crime with crime,"
7344,EPILOGUE,"State overthrown on ruining state,"
7345,EPILOGUE,And dares not be disconsolate.
7346,EPILOGUE,"Only the soul hath feet to climb,"
7347,EPILOGUE,"Only the soul hath room to wait,"
7348,EPILOGUE,Hath brows and eyes to hold sublime
7349,EPILOGUE,"Above all evil and all good,"
7350,EPILOGUE,All strength and all decrepitude.
7351,EPILOGUE,
7352,EPILOGUE,"She only, she since earth began,"
7353,EPILOGUE,"The many-minded soul of man,"
7354,EPILOGUE,From one incognizable root
7355,EPILOGUE,"That bears such divers-coloured fruit,"
7356,EPILOGUE,Hath ruled for blessing or for ban
7357,EPILOGUE,The flight of seasons and pursuit;
7358,EPILOGUE,"She regent, she republican,"
7359,EPILOGUE,With wide and equal eyes and wings
7360,EPILOGUE,Broods on things born and dying things.
7361,EPILOGUE,
7362,EPILOGUE,Even now for love or doubt of us
7363,EPILOGUE,The hour intense and hazardous
7364,EPILOGUE,Hangs high with pinions vibrating
7365,EPILOGUE,"Whereto the light and darkness cling,"
7366,EPILOGUE,"Dividing the dim season thus,"
7367,EPILOGUE,And shakes from one ambiguous wing
7368,EPILOGUE,"Shadow, and one is luminous,"
7369,EPILOGUE,And day falls from it; so the past
7370,EPILOGUE,Torments the future to the last.
7371,EPILOGUE,
7372,EPILOGUE,And we that cannot hear or see
7373,EPILOGUE,"The sounds and lights of liberty,"
7374,EPILOGUE,The witness of the naked God
7375,EPILOGUE,That treads on burning hours unshod
7376,EPILOGUE,With instant feet unwounded; we
7377,EPILOGUE,That can trace only where he trod
7378,EPILOGUE,"By fire in heaven or storm at sea,"
7379,EPILOGUE,Not know the very present whole
7380,EPILOGUE,And naked nature of the soul;
7381,EPILOGUE,
7382,EPILOGUE,"We that see wars and woes and kings,"
7383,EPILOGUE,"And portents of enormous things,"
7384,EPILOGUE,"Empires, and agonies, and slaves,"
7385,EPILOGUE,And whole flame of town-swallowing graves;
7386,EPILOGUE,That hear the harsh hours clap sharp wings
7387,EPILOGUE,"Above the roar of ranks like waves,"
7388,EPILOGUE,From wreck to wreck as the world swings;
7389,EPILOGUE,Know but that men there are who see
7390,EPILOGUE,And hear things other far than we.
7391,EPILOGUE,
7392,EPILOGUE,"By the light sitting on their brows,"
7393,EPILOGUE,"The fire wherewith their presence glows,"
7394,EPILOGUE,"The music falling with their feet,"
7395,EPILOGUE,The sweet sense of a spirit sweet
7396,EPILOGUE,That with their speech or motion grows
7397,EPILOGUE,And breathes and burns men’s hearts with heat;
7398,EPILOGUE,By these signs there is none but knows
7399,EPILOGUE,"Men who have life and grace to give,"
7400,EPILOGUE,Men who have seen the soul and live.
7401,EPILOGUE,
7402,EPILOGUE,"By the strength sleeping in their eyes,"
7403,EPILOGUE,The lips whereon their sorrow lies
7404,EPILOGUE,"Smiling, the lines of tears unshed,"
7405,EPILOGUE,The large divine look of one dead
7406,EPILOGUE,That speaks out of the breathless skies
7407,EPILOGUE,"In silence, when the light is shed"
7408,EPILOGUE,Upon man’s soul of memories;
7409,EPILOGUE,"The supreme look that sets love free,"
7410,EPILOGUE,The look of stars and of the sea;
7411,EPILOGUE,
7412,EPILOGUE,By the strong patient godhead seen
7413,EPILOGUE,"Implicit in their mortal mien,"
7414,EPILOGUE,The conscience of a God held still
7415,EPILOGUE,And thunders ruled by their own will
7416,EPILOGUE,And fast-bound fires that might burn clean
7417,EPILOGUE,"This worldly air that foul things fill,"
7418,EPILOGUE,"And the afterglow of what has been,"
7419,EPILOGUE,"That, passing, shows us without word"
7420,EPILOGUE,"What they have seen, what they have heard,"
7421,EPILOGUE,
7422,EPILOGUE,By all these keen and burning signs
7423,EPILOGUE,The spirit knows them and divines.
7424,EPILOGUE,"In bonds, in banishment, in grief,"
7425,EPILOGUE,"Scoffed at and scourged with unbelief,"
7426,EPILOGUE,"Foiled with false trusts and thwart designs,"
7427,EPILOGUE,"Stripped of green days and hopes in leaf,"
7428,EPILOGUE,Their mere bare body of glory shines
7429,EPILOGUE,"Higher, and man gazing surelier sees"
7430,EPILOGUE,"What light, what comfort is of these."
7431,EPILOGUE,
7432,EPILOGUE,So I now gazing; till the sense
7433,EPILOGUE,Being set on fire of confidence
7434,EPILOGUE,"Strains itself sunward, feels out far"
7435,EPILOGUE,"Beyond the bright and morning star,"
7436,EPILOGUE,"Beyond the extreme wave’s refluence,"
7437,EPILOGUE,To where the fierce first sunbeams are
7438,EPILOGUE,Whose fire intolerant and intense
7439,EPILOGUE,As birthpangs whence day burns to be
7440,EPILOGUE,Parts breathless heaven from breathing sea.
7441,EPILOGUE,
7442,EPILOGUE,"I see not, know not, and am blest,"
7443,EPILOGUE,"Master, who know that thou knowest,"
7444,EPILOGUE,"Dear lord and leader, at whose hand"
7445,EPILOGUE,"The first days and the last days stand,"
7446,EPILOGUE,"With scars and crowns on head and breast,"
7447,EPILOGUE,That fought for love of the sweet land
7448,EPILOGUE,Or shall fight in her latter quest;
7449,EPILOGUE,All the days armed and girt and crowned
7450,EPILOGUE,Whose glories ring thy glory round.
7451,EPILOGUE,
7452,EPILOGUE,"Thou sawest, when all the world was blind,"
7453,EPILOGUE,"The light that should be of mankind,"
7454,EPILOGUE,The very day that was to be;
7455,EPILOGUE,And how shalt thou not sometime see
7456,EPILOGUE,Thy city perfect to thy mind
7457,EPILOGUE,"Stand face to living face with thee,"
7458,EPILOGUE,And no miscrowned man’s head behind;
7459,EPILOGUE,"The hearth of man, the human home,"
7460,EPILOGUE,The central flame that shall be Rome?
7461,EPILOGUE,
7462,EPILOGUE,As one that ere a June day rise
7463,EPILOGUE,"Makes seaward for the dawn, and tries"
7464,EPILOGUE,The water with delighted limbs
7465,EPILOGUE,"That taste the sweet dark sea, and swims"
7466,EPILOGUE,"Right eastward under strengthening skies,"
7467,EPILOGUE,And sees the gradual rippling rims
7468,EPILOGUE,Of waves whence day breaks blossom-wise
7469,EPILOGUE,"Take fire ere light peer well above,"
7470,EPILOGUE,And laughs from all his heart with love;
7471,EPILOGUE,
7472,EPILOGUE,And softlier swimming with raised head
7473,EPILOGUE,Feels the full flower of morning shed
7474,EPILOGUE,And fluent sunrise round him rolled
7475,EPILOGUE,That laps and laves his body bold
7476,EPILOGUE,"With fluctuant heaven in water’s stead,"
7477,EPILOGUE,And urgent through the growing gold
7478,EPILOGUE,"Strikes, and sees all the spray flash red,"
7479,EPILOGUE,"And his soul takes the sun, and yearns"
7480,EPILOGUE,For joy wherewith the sea’s heart burns;
7481,EPILOGUE,
7482,EPILOGUE,So the soul seeking through the dark
7483,EPILOGUE,"Heavenward, a dove without an ark,"
7484,EPILOGUE,Transcends the unnavigable sea
7485,EPILOGUE,Of years that wear out memory;
7486,EPILOGUE,"So calls, a sunward-singing lark,"
7487,EPILOGUE,In the ear of souls that should be free;
7488,EPILOGUE,So points them toward the sun for mark
7489,EPILOGUE,"Who steer not for the stress of waves,"
7490,EPILOGUE,"And seek strange helmsmen, and are slaves."
7491,EPILOGUE,
7492,EPILOGUE,For if the swimmer’s eastward eye
7493,EPILOGUE,Must see no sunrise—must put by
7494,EPILOGUE,The hope that lifted him and led
7495,EPILOGUE,"Once, to have light about his head,"
7496,EPILOGUE,To see beneath the clear low sky
7497,EPILOGUE,The green foam-whitened wave wax red
7498,EPILOGUE,And all the morning’s banner fly—
7499,EPILOGUE,"Then, as earth’s helpless hopes go down,"
7500,EPILOGUE,Let earth’s self in the dark tides drown.
7501,EPILOGUE,
7502,EPILOGUE,"Yea, if no morning must behold"
7503,EPILOGUE,"Man, other than were they now cold,"
7504,EPILOGUE,"And other deeds than past deeds done,"
7505,EPILOGUE,Nor any near or far-off sun
7506,EPILOGUE,"Salute him risen and sunlike-souled,"
7507,EPILOGUE,"Free, boundless, fearless, perfect, one,"
7508,EPILOGUE,"Let man’s world die like worlds of old,"
7509,EPILOGUE,And here in heaven’s sight only be
7510,EPILOGUE,The sole sun on the worldless sea.

7548,P. 161,which tells how she succeeded in humanizing a criminal under sentence of
7549,P. 161,"death, and given over by the priests as a soul doomed and desperate; how"
7550,P. 161,the man thus raised and melted out of his fierce and brutal despair
7551,P. 161,"besought her to sustain him to the last by her presence; how, having"
7552,P. 161,"accompanied him with comfort and support to the very scaffold, and seen"
7553,P. 161,"his head fall, she took it up, and turning to the spectators who stood"
7554,P. 161,"doubtful whether the poor wretch could be “saved,” kissed it in sign of"
7555,P. 161,her faith that his sins were forgiven him.  The high and fixed passion of
7556,P. 161,her heroic temperament gives her a right to remembrance and honour of
7557,P. 161,which the miracle-mongers have done their best to deprive her.  Cleared
7558,P. 161,"of all the refuse rubbish of thaumaturgy, her life would deserve a"
7559,P. 161,chronicler who should do justice at once to the ardour of her religious
7560,P. 161,imagination and to a thing far rarer and more precious—the strength and
7561,P. 161,breadth of patriotic thought and devotion which sent this girl across the
7562,P. 161,"Alps to seek the living symbol of Italian hope and unity, and bring it"
7563,P. 161,back by force of simple appeal in the name of God and of the country.  By
