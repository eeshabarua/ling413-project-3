431,II.,
432,II.,Then wearily the nurse did throw
433,II.,Her pallet in the darkest place
434,II.,"Of that sick room, and slept and dreamed:"
435,II.,"For, as the gusty wind did blow"
436,II.,"The night-lamp's flare across her face,"
437,II.,"She saw or seemed to see, but dreamed,"
438,II.,"That the poplars tall on the opposite hill,"
439,II.,"The seven tall poplars on the hill,"
440,II.,Did clasp the setting sun until
441,II.,"His rays dropped from him, pined and still"
442,II.,"As blossoms in frost,"
443,II.,"Till he waned and paled, so weirdly crossed,"
444,II.,To the colour of moonlight which doth pass
445,II.,Over the dank ridged churchyard grass.
446,II.,"The poplars held the sun, and he"
447,II.,The eyes of the nurse that they should not see

450,II.,"Too chill, and lay too heavily."
451,II.,
452,III.,III.
453,III.,
454,III.,She only dreamed; for all the while
455,III.,'T was Lady Isobel that kept
456,III.,The little baby: and it slept
457,III.,"Fast, warm, as if its mother's smile,"
458,III.,"Laden with love's dewy weight,"
459,III.,And red as rose of Harpocrate
460,III.,"Dropt upon its eyelids, pressed"
461,III.,Lashes to cheek in a sealèd rest.
462,III.,
463,IV.,IV.
464,IV.,
465,IV.,And more and more smiled Isobel
466,IV.,To see the baby sleep so well--
467,IV.,She knew not that she smiled.
468,IV.,"Against the lattice, dull and wild"
469,IV.,"Drive the heavy droning drops,"
470,IV.,"Drop by drop, the sound being one;"
471,IV.,As momently time's segments fall
472,IV.,"On the ear of God, who hears through all"
473,IV.,Eternity's unbroken monotone:
474,IV.,And more and more smiled Isobel
475,IV.,To see the baby sleep so well--
476,IV.,She knew not that she smiled.
477,IV.,The wind in intermission stops
478,IV.,"Down in the beechen forest,"
479,IV.,Then cries aloud
480,IV.,"As one at the sorest,"
481,IV.,"Self-stung, self-driven,"
482,IV.,"And rises up to its very tops,"
483,IV.,"Stiffening erect the branches bowed,"
484,IV.,Dilating with a tempest-soul
485,IV.,The trees that with their dark hands break
486,IV.,"Through their own outline, and heavy roll"
487,IV.,Shadows as massive as clouds in heaven
488,IV.,Across the castle lake
489,IV.,And more and more smiled Isobel
490,IV.,To see the baby sleep so well;
491,IV.,She knew not that she smiled;
492,IV.,She knew not that the storm was wild;
493,IV.,Through the uproar drear she could not hear
494,IV.,The castle clock which struck anear--
495,IV.,"She heard the low, light breathing of her child."
496,IV.,
497,V.,V.
498,V.,
499,V.,O sight for wondering look!
500,V.,While the external nature broke
501,V.,"Into such abandonment,"
502,V.,"While the very mist, heart-rent"
503,V.,"By the lightning, seemed to eddy"
504,V.,"Against nature, with a din,--"
505,V.,A sense of silence and of steady
506,V.,Natural calm appeared to come
507,V.,"From things without, and enter in"
508,V.,The human creature's room.
509,V.,
510,VI.,VI.
511,VI.,
512,VI.,"So motionless she sate,"

514,VI.,You might have dreamed their souls had gone
515,VI.,"Away to things inanimate,"
516,VI.,"In such to live, in such to moan;"
517,VI.,"And that their bodies had ta'en back,"
518,VI.,"In mystic change, all silences"

520,VI.,Or dwell beneath the reedy ground
521,VI.,In waters safe from their own sound:
522,VI.,Only she wore
523,VI.,"The deepening smile I named before,"
524,VI.,And _that_ a deepening love expressed;
525,VI.,And who at once can love and rest?
526,VI.,
527,VII.,VII.
528,VII.,
529,VII.,In sooth the smile that then was keeping
530,VII.,"Watch upon the baby sleeping,"
531,VII.,Floated with its tender light
532,VII.,"Downward, from the drooping eyes,"
533,VII.,"Upward, from the lips apart,"
534,VII.,Over cheeks which had grown white
535,VII.,With an eight-day weeping:
536,VII.,All smiles come in such a wise
537,VII.,Where tears shall fall or have of old--
538,VII.,Like northern lights that fill the heart
539,VII.,Of heaven in sign of cold.
540,VII.,
541,VIII.,VIII.
542,VIII.,
543,VIII.,Motionless she sate.
544,VIII.,Her hair had fallen by its weight
545,VIII.,On each side of her smile and lay
546,VIII.,Very blackly on the arm
547,VIII.,"Where the baby nestled warm,"
548,VIII.,Pale as baby carved in stone
549,VIII.,Seen by glimpses of the moon
550,VIII.,Up a dark cathedral aisle:
551,VIII.,"But, through the storm, no moonbeam fell"
552,VIII.,Upon the child of Isobel--
553,VIII.,Perhaps you saw it by the ray
554,VIII.,Alone of her still smile.
555,VIII.,
556,IX.,IX.
557,IX.,
558,IX.,A solemn thing it is to me
559,IX.,To look upon a babe that sleeps
560,IX.,Wearing in its spirit-deeps
561,IX.,The undeveloped mystery
562,IX.,"Of our Adam's taint and woe,"
563,IX.,"Which, when they developed be,"
564,IX.,Will not let it slumber so;
565,IX.,Lying new in life beneath
566,IX.,"The shadow of the coming death,"
567,IX.,"With that soft, low, quiet breath,"
568,IX.,As if it felt the sun;
569,IX.,"Knowing all things by their blooms,"
570,IX.,"Not their roots, yea, sun and sky"
571,IX.,Only by the warmth that comes
572,IX.,"Out of each, earth only by"
573,IX.,"The pleasant hues that o'er it run,"
574,IX.,And human love by drops of sweet
575,IX.,White nourishment still hanging round
576,IX.,The little mouth so slumber-bound:
577,IX.,All which broken sentiency
578,IX.,"And conclusion incomplete,"
579,IX.,Will gather and unite and climb
580,IX.,To an immortality
581,IX.,"Good or evil, each sublime,"
582,IX.,Through life and death to life again.
583,IX.,"O little lids, now folded fast,"
584,IX.,Must ye learn to drop at last
585,IX.,Our large and burning tears?
586,IX.,"O warm quick body, must thou lie,"
587,IX.,"When the time comes round to die,"
588,IX.,"Still from all the whirl of years,"
589,IX.,Bare of all the joy and pain?
590,IX.,"O small frail being, wilt thou stand"
591,IX.,"At God's right hand,"
592,IX.,Lifting up those sleeping eyes
593,IX.,"Dilated by great destinies,"
594,IX.,To an endless waking? thrones and seraphim.
595,IX.,"Through the long ranks of their solemnities,"
596,IX.,"Sunning thee with calm looks of Heaven's surprise,"
597,IX.,But thine alone on Him?
598,IX.,"Or else, self-willed, to tread the Godless place,"
599,IX.,(God keep thy will!) feel thine own energies
600,IX.,"Cold, strong, objèctless, like a dead man's clasp,"
601,IX.,"The sleepless deathless life within thee grasp,--"
602,IX.,"While myriad faces, like one changeless face,"

612,X.,"Hour by hour, on bended knees,"
613,X.,With pale-wrung hands and prayings low
614,X.,"And broken, through which came the sound"
615,X.,"Of tears that fell against the ground,"

625,X.,In breasts of angels high and good!
626,X.,"Oh, take not, Lord, my babe away--"

630,X.,Around his father's knees and known

633,X.,"Think, God among the cherubim,"

640,X.,Doth make thy whole warm earth a-cold!
641,X.,"O God, I am so young, so young--"
642,X.,I am not used to tears at nights
643,X.,Instead of slumber--not to prayer
644,X.,With sobbing lips and hands out-wrung!
645,X.,Thou knowest all my prayings were
646,X.,"'I bless thee, God, for past delights--"
647,X.,Thank God!' I am not used to bear

3821,XXVI.,XXVI.
3822,XXVI.,
3823,XXVI.,I am pale as crocus grows

3845,XXVIII.,Some one might be waiting for
3846,XXVIII.,Some last word that I might say.
3847,XXVIII.,Nay? So best!--so angels would

3938,III.,"She has halls among the woodlands, she has castles by the breakers,"
3939,III.,"She has farms and she has manors, she can threaten and command:"
3940,III.,"And the palpitating engines snort in steam across her acres,"

3942,III.,
3943,IV.,IV.
3944,IV.,
3945,IV.,There are none of England's daughters who can show a prouder presence;
3946,IV.,Upon princely suitors' praying she has looked in her disdain.
3947,IV.,"She was sprung of English nobles, I was born of English peasants;"

4034,XVI.,"""I invite you, Mister Bertram, to no scene for worldly speeches--"

4067,XX.,
4068,XXI.,XXI.
4069,XXI.,
4070,XXI.,"And there evermore was music, both of instrument and singing,"
4071,XXI.,Till the finches of the shrubberies grew restless in the dark;
4072,XXI.,"But the cedars stood up motionless, each in a moonlight's ringing,"
4073,XXI.,"And the deer, half in the glimmer, strewed the hollows of the park."

4075,XXII.,XXII.
4076,XXII.,
4077,XXII.,And though sometimes she would bind me with her silver-corded speeches

4088,XXIII.,Went a-wandering up the gardens through the laurels and abeles.
4089,XXIII.,
4090,XXIV.,XXIV.
4091,XXIV.,
4092,XXIV.,"Thus, her foot upon the new-mown grass, bareheaded, with the flowing"

4097,XXV.,XXV.
4098,XXV.,
4099,XXV.,"With a bunch of dewy maple, which her right hand held above her,"

4103,XXV.,
4104,XXVI.,XXVI.
4105,XXVI.,
4106,XXVI.,"For her eyes alone smile constantly; her lips have serious sweetness,"

4692,I.,I stand on the mark beside the shore
4693,I.,"Of the first white pilgrim's bended knee,"
4694,I.,"Where exile turned to ancestor,"
4695,I.,And God was thanked for liberty.
4696,I.,"I have run through the night, my skin is as dark,"
4697,I.,I bend my knee down on this mark:

4701,II.,
4702,II.,"O pilgrim-souls, I speak to you!"
4703,II.,I see you come proud and slow

4706,II.,"O pilgrims, I have gasped and run"

4715,III.,In undertone to the ocean's roar;
4716,III.,"And lift my black face, my black hand,"

4729,IV.,
4730,V.,V.
4731,V.,
4732,V.,And yet He has made dark things

4748,VI.,By reaching through the prison-bars.
4749,VI.,
4750,VII.,VII.
4751,VII.,
4752,VII.,"Indeed we live beneath the sky,"
4753,VII.,That great smooth Hand of God stretched out

4757,VII.,All opened straight up to His face

4764,VIII.,As if we were not black and lost;
4765,VIII.,"And the beasts and birds, in wood and fold,"
4766,VIII.,Do fear and take us for very men:
4767,VIII.,Could the whip-poor-will or the cat of the glen

4778,IX.,I look at the sky and the sea.
4779,IX.,
4780,X.,X.

4785,X.,"To conquer the world, we thought."
4786,X.,The drivers drove us day by day;

4789,X.,
4790,XI.,XI.
4791,XI.,
4792,XI.,"In the sunny ground between the canes,"
4793,XI.,"He said ""I love you"" as he passed;"
4794,XI.,"When the shingle-roof rang sharp with the rains,"
4795,XI.,I heard how he vowed it fast:
4796,XI.,"While others shook he smiled in the hut,"
4797,XI.,As he carved me a bowl of the cocoa-nut
4798,XI.,Through the roar of the hurricanes.
4799,XI.,
4800,XII.,XII.
4801,XII.,
4802,XII.,"I sang his name instead of a song,"

4804,XII.,Upward and downward I drew it along
4805,XII.,"My various notes,--the same, the same!"
4806,XII.,"I sang it low, that the slave-girls near"
4807,XII.,"Might never guess, from aught they could hear,"

4812,XIII.,I look on the sky and the sea.
4813,XIII.,"We were two to love, and two to pray:"

4821,XIV.,
4822,XIV.,"We were black, we were black,"

4825,XIV.,"They wrung my cold hands out of his,"
4826,XIV.,They dragged him--where? I crawled to touch
4827,XIV.,"His blood's mark in the dust ... not much,"

4829,XIV.,
4830,XV.,XV.
4831,XV.,
4832,XV.,"Wrong, followed by a deeper wrong!"
4833,XV.,Mere grief's too good for such as I:
4834,XV.,So the white men brought the shame ere long
4835,XV.,To strangle the sob of my agony.
4836,XV.,They would not leave me for my dull
4837,XV.,Wet eyes!--it was too merciful
4838,XV.,To let me weep pure tears and die.
4839,XV.,
4840,XVI.,XVI.

4842,XVI.,"I am black, I am black!"

4854,XVII.,"And the babe who lay on my bosom so,"
4855,XVII.,"Was far too white, too white for me;"
4856,XVII.,As white as the ladies who scorned to pray
4857,XVII.,"Beside me at church but yesterday,"
4858,XVII.,Though my tears had washed a place for my knee.

4860,XVIII.,XVIII.
4861,XVIII.,
4862,XVIII.,"My own, own child! I could not bear"
4863,XVIII.,"To look in his face, it was so white;"
4864,XVIII.,"I covered him up with a kerchief there,"
4865,XVIII.,I covered his face in close and tight:
4866,XVIII.,"And he moaned and struggled, as well might be,"
4867,XVIII.,For the white child wanted his liberty--
4868,XVIII.,"Ha, ha! he wanted the master-right."
4869,XVIII.,
4870,XIX.,XIX.
4871,XIX.,
4872,XIX.,"He moaned and beat with his head and feet,"
4873,XIX.,His little feet that never grew;
4874,XIX.,"He struck them out, as it was meet,"
4875,XIX.,Against my heart to break it through:
4876,XIX.,"I might have sung and made him mild,"
4877,XIX.,But I dared not sing to the white-faced child
4878,XIX.,The only song I knew.
4879,XIX.,
4880,XX.,XX.
4881,XX.,
4882,XX.,I pulled the kerchief very close:
4883,XX.,"He could not see the sun, I swear,"
4884,XX.,"More, then, alive, than now he does"
4885,XX.,From between the roots of the mango ... where?
4886,XX.,I know where. Close! A child and mother
4887,XX.,Do wrong to look at one another
4888,XX.,When one is black and one is fair.
4889,XX.,
4890,XXI.,XXI.
4891,XXI.,
4892,XXI.,"Why, in that single glance I had"
4893,XXI.,"Of my child's face, ... I tell you all,"
4894,XXI.,I saw a look that made me mad!
4895,XXI.,"The _master's_ look, that used to fall"
4896,XXI.,On my soul like his lash ... or worse!
4897,XXI.,"And so, to save it from my curse,"
4898,XXI.,I twisted it round in my shawl.
4899,XXI.,
4900,XXII.,XXII.
4901,XXII.,
4902,XXII.,"And he moaned and trembled from foot to head,"
4903,XXII.,He shivered from head to foot;
4904,XXII.,"Till after a time, he lay instead"
4905,XXII.,Too suddenly still and mute.
4906,XXII.,"I felt, beside, a stiffening cold:"
4907,XXII.,"I dared to lift up just a fold,"
4908,XXII.,As in lifting a leaf of the mango-fruit.
4909,XXII.,
4910,XXIII.,XXIII.
4911,XXIII.,
4912,XXIII.,"But _my_ fruit ... ha, ha!--there, had been"
4913,XXIII.,(I laugh to think on 't at this hour!)
4914,XXIII.,Your fine white angels (who have seen
4915,XXIII.,Nearest the secret of God's power)
4916,XXIII.,"And plucked my fruit to make them wine,"
4917,XXIII.,And sucked the soul of that child of mine
4918,XXIII.,As the humming-bird sucks the soul of the flower.
4919,XXIII.,
4920,XXIV.,XXIV.
4921,XXIV.,
4922,XXIV.,"Ha, ha, the trick of the angels white!"
4923,XXIV.,They freed the white child's spirit so.
4924,XXIV.,"I said not a word, but day and night"
4925,XXIV.,"I carried the body to and fro,"
4926,XXIV.,"And it lay on my heart like a stone, as chill."
4927,XXIV.,--The sun may shine out as much as he will:
4928,XXIV.,"I am cold, though it happened a month ago."
4929,XXIV.,
4930,XXV.,XXV.
4931,XXV.,
4932,XXV.,"From the white man's house, and the black man's hut,"
4933,XXV.,I carried the little body on;
4934,XXV.,"The forest's arms did round us shut,"
4935,XXV.,And silence through the trees did run:
4936,XXV.,"They asked no question as I went,"
4937,XXV.,"They stood too high for astonishment,"
4938,XXV.,They could see God sit on his throne.
4939,XXV.,
4940,XXVI.,XXVI.
4941,XXVI.,
4942,XXVI.,"My little body, kerchiefed fast,"
4943,XXVI.,"I bore it on through the forest, on;"
4944,XXVI.,"And when I felt it was tired at last,"
4945,XXVI.,I scooped a hole beneath the moon:
4946,XXVI.,"Through the forest-tops the angels far,"
4947,XXVI.,"With a white sharp finger from every star,"
4948,XXVI.,Did point and mock at what was done.
4949,XXVI.,
4950,XXVII.,XXVII.
4951,XXVII.,
4952,XXVII.,"Yet when it was all done aught,--"
4953,XXVII.,"Earth, 'twixt me and my baby, strewed,--"
4954,XXVII.,"All, changed to black earth,--nothing white,--"
4955,XXVII.,A dark child in the dark!--ensued
4956,XXVII.,"Some comfort, and my heart grew young;"
4957,XXVII.,I sate down smiling there and sung
4958,XXVII.,The song I learnt in my maidenhood.
4959,XXVII.,
4960,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
4961,XXVIII.,
4962,XXVIII.,"And thus we two were reconciled,"
4963,XXVIII.,"The white child and black mother, thus;"
4964,XXVIII.,"For as I sang it soft and wild,"
4965,XXVIII.,"The same song, more melodious,"
4966,XXVIII.,Rose from the grave whereon I sate
4967,XXVIII.,"It was the dead child singing that,"
4968,XXVIII.,To join the souls of both of us.

4975,XXIX.,But the pilgrim-ghosts have slid away

6050,VI.,When I sit meek in heaven!
6051,VI.,"For me, for me,"
6052,VI.,God knows that I am feeble like the rest!
6053,VI.,"I often wandered forth, more child than maiden"
6054,VI.,Among the midnight hills of Galilee
6055,VI.,"Whose summits looked heaven-laden,"
6056,VI.,Listening to silence as it seemed to be
6057,VI.,"God's voice, so soft yet strong, so fain to press"
6058,VI.,"Upon my heart as heaven did on the height,"
6059,VI.,"And waken up its shadows by a light,"
6060,VI.,And show its vileness by a holiness.
6061,VI.,"Then I knelt down most silent like the night,"
6062,VI.,"Too self-renounced for fears,"
6063,VI.,Raising my small face to the boundless blue
6064,VI.,Whose stars did mix and tremble in my tears:
6065,VI.,"God heard _them_ falling after, with His dew."
6066,VI.,
6067,VII.,VII.

6087,VIII.,
6088,VIII.,"Art Thou a King, then? Come, His universe,"
6089,VIII.,"Come, crown me Him a King!"
6090,VIII.,Pluck rays from all such stars as never fling
6091,VIII.,"Their light where fell a curse,"
6092,VIII.,And make a crowning for this kingly brow!--
6093,VIII.,What is my word? Each empyreal star
6094,VIII.,Sits in a sphere afar
6095,VIII.,In shining ambuscade:
6096,VIII.,"The child-brow, crowned by none,"
6097,VIII.,Keeps its unchildlike shade.
6098,VIII.,"Sleep, sleep, my crownless One!"
6099,VIII.,

6171,_AN ISLAND._,
6172,_AN ISLAND._,
6173,I.,I.
6174,I.,
6175,I.,My dream is of an island-place
6176,I.,"Which distant seas keep lonely,"
6177,I.,A little island on whose face
6178,I.,The stars are watchers only:
6179,I.,Those bright still stars! they need not seem
6180,I.,Brighter or stiller in my dream.
6181,I.,
6182,II.,II.
6183,II.,
6184,II.,"An island full of hills and dells,"
6185,II.,All rumpled and uneven
6186,II.,"With green recesses, sudden swells,"
6187,II.,And odorous valleys driven
6188,II.,So deep and straight that always there
6189,II.,The wind is cradled to soft air.
6190,II.,
6191,III.,III.
6192,III.,
6193,III.,Hills running up to heaven for light
6194,III.,"Through woods that half-way ran,"
6195,III.,As if the wild earth mimicked right
6196,III.,The wilder heart of man:
6197,III.,Only it shall be greener far
6198,III.,And gladder than hearts ever are.
6199,III.,
6200,IV.,IV.
6201,IV.,
6202,IV.,"More like, perhaps, that mountain piece"
6203,IV.,"Of Dante's paradise,"
6204,IV.,"Disrupt to an hundred hills like these,"
6205,IV.,In falling from the skies;
6206,IV.,"Bringing within it, all the roots"
6207,IV.,Of heavenly trees and flowers and fruits:
6208,IV.,
6209,V.,V.
6210,V.,
6211,V.,For--saving where the grey rocks strike
6212,V.,"Their javelins up the azure,"
6213,V.,Or where deep fissures miser-like
6214,V.,"Hoard up some fountain treasure,"
6215,V.,"(And e'en in them, stoop down and hear,"
6216,V.,"Leaf sounds with water in your ear,--)"
6217,V.,
6218,VI.,VI.
6219,VI.,
6220,VI.,"The place is all awave with trees,"
6221,VI.,"Limes, myrtles purple-beaded,"
6222,VI.,Acacias having drunk the lees
6223,VI.,"Of the night-dew, faint-headed,"
6224,VI.,And wan grey olive-woods which seem
6225,VI.,The fittest foliage for a dream.
6226,VI.,
6227,VII.,VII.
6228,VII.,
6229,VII.,"Trees, trees on all sides! they combine"
6230,VII.,"Their plumy shades to throw,"
6231,VII.,Through whose clear fruit and blossom fine
6232,VII.,"Whene'er the sun may go,"
6233,VII.,"The ground beneath he deeply stains,"
6234,VII.,As passing through cathedral panes.
6235,VII.,
6236,VIII.,VIII.
6237,VIII.,
6238,VIII.,But little needs this earth of ours
6239,VIII.,"That shining from above her,"
6240,VIII.,When many Pleiades of flowers
6241,VIII.,"(Not one lost) star her over,"
6242,VIII.,The rays of their unnumbered hues
6243,VIII.,Being all refracted by the dews.
6244,VIII.,

6246,IX.,
6247,IX.,Wide-petalled plants that boldly drink
6248,IX.,"The Amreeta of the sky,"
6249,IX.,"Shut bells that dull with rapture sink,"
6250,IX.,"And lolling buds, half shy;"
6251,IX.,"I cannot count them, but between"
6252,IX.,"Is room for grass and mosses green,"
6253,IX.,
6254,X.,X.
6255,X.,
6256,X.,"And brooks, that glass in different strengths"
6257,X.,"All colours in disorder,"
6258,X.,"Or, gathering up their silver lengths"
6259,X.,"Beside their winding border,"
6260,X.,"Sleep, haunted through the slumber hidden,"
6261,X.,By lilies white as dreams in Eden.
6262,X.,
6263,XI.,XI.
6264,XI.,
6265,XI.,Nor think each archèd tree with each
6266,XI.,Too closely interlaces
6267,XI.,"To admit of vistas out of reach,"
6268,XI.,And broad moon-lighted places
6269,XI.,Upon whose sward the antlered deer
6270,XI.,May view their double image clear.
6271,XI.,

6275,XII.,(Kept happy not by halves)
6276,XII.,"Mild cows, that at the vine-wreaths pull,"
6277,XII.,Then low back at their calves
6278,XII.,"With tender lowings, to approve"
6279,XII.,The warm mouths milking them for love.
6280,XII.,
6281,XIII.,XIII.
6282,XIII.,
6283,XIII.,"Free gamesome horses, antelopes,"

6286,XIII.,And sheep unruled by shepherds:
6287,XIII.,"Hares, lizards, hedgehogs, badgers, mice,"
6288,XIII.,"Snakes, squirrels, frogs, and butterflies."
6289,XIII.,
6290,XIV.,XIV.

6295,XIV.,Self-sphered in those grand tails;
6296,XIV.,"All creatures glad and safe, I deem"
6297,XIV.,No guns nor springes in my dream!
6298,XIV.,
6299,XV.,XV.
6300,XV.,
6301,XV.,The island's edges are a-wing
6302,XV.,With trees that overbranch
6303,XV.,The sea with song-birds welcoming
6304,XV.,The curlews to green change;
6305,XV.,And doves from half-closed lids espy
6306,XV.,The red and purple fish go by.
6307,XV.,
6308,XVI.,XVI.
6309,XVI.,
6310,XVI.,One dove is answering in trust
6311,XVI.,"The water every minute,"
6312,XVI.,Thinking so soft a murmur must
6313,XVI.,Have her mate's cooing in it:
6314,XVI.,So softly doth earth's beauty round
6315,XVI.,Infuse itself in ocean's sound.
6316,XVI.,
6317,XVII.,XVII.
6318,XVII.,
6319,XVII.,My sanguine soul bounds forwarder
6320,XVII.,To meet the bounding waves;
6321,XVII.,"Beside them straightway I repair,"
6322,XVII.,To live within the caves:
6323,XVII.,And near me two or three may dwell
6324,XVII.,Whom dreams fantastic please as well.
6325,XVII.,
6326,XVIII.,XVIII.
6327,XVIII.,
6328,XVIII.,"Long winding caverns, glittering far"
6329,XVIII.,Into a crystal distance!
6330,XVIII.,Through clefts of which shall many a star
6331,XVIII.,"Shine clear without resistance,"
6332,XVIII.,And carry down its rays the smell
6333,XVIII.,Of flowers above invisible.
6334,XVIII.,
6335,XIX.,XIX.
6336,XIX.,
6337,XIX.,I said that two or three might choose
6338,XIX.,Their dwelling near mine own:
6339,XIX.,"Those who would change man's voice and use,"
6340,XIX.,For Nature's way and tone--
6341,XIX.,"Man's veering heart and careless eyes,"
6342,XIX.,For Nature's steadfast sympathies.
6343,XIX.,
6344,XX.,XX.
6345,XX.,
6346,XX.,"Ourselves, to meet her faithfulness,"
6347,XX.,Shall play a faithful part;
6348,XX.,Her beautiful shall ne'er address
6349,XX.,The monstrous at our heart:
6350,XX.,Her musical shall ever touch
6351,XX.,Something within us also such.
6352,XX.,
6353,XXI.,XXI.
6354,XXI.,
6355,XXI.,"Yet shall she not our mistress live,"
6356,XXI.,"As doth the moon of ocean,"
6357,XXI.,Though gently as the moon she give
6358,XXI.,Our thoughts a light and motion:
6359,XXI.,"More like a harp of many lays,"
6360,XXI.,Moving its master while he plays.
6361,XXI.,
6362,XXII.,XXII.
6363,XXII.,
6364,XXII.,No sod in all that island doth
6365,XXII.,Yawn open for the dead;
6366,XXII.,No wind hath borne a traitor's oath;
6367,XXII.,"No earth, a mourner's tread;"
6368,XXII.,"We cannot say by stream or shade,"
6369,XXII.,"""I suffered _here_,--was _here_ betrayed."""
6370,XXII.,
6371,XXIII.,XXIII.
6372,XXIII.,
6373,XXIII.,"Our only ""farewell"" we shall laugh"
6374,XXIII.,"To shifting cloud or hour,"
6375,XXIII.,And use our only epitaph
6376,XXIII.,To some bud turned a flower:
6377,XXIII.,Our only tears shall serve to prove
6378,XXIII.,Excess in pleasure or in love.
6379,XXIII.,
6380,XXIV.,XXIV.
6381,XXIV.,
6382,XXIV.,Our fancies shall their plumage catch
6383,XXIV.,"From fairest island-birds,"
6384,XXIV.,"Whose eggs let young ones out at hatch,"
6385,XXIV.,Born singing! then our words
6386,XXIV.,Unconsciously shall take the dyes
6387,XXIV.,Of those prodigious fantasies.

6389,XXV.,XXV.
6390,XXV.,
6391,XXV.,"Yea, soon, no consonant unsmooth"
6392,XXV.,Our smile-tuned lips shall reach;
6393,XXV.,Sounds sweet as Hellas spake in youth
6394,XXV.,Shall glide into our speech:
6395,XXV.,"(What music, certes, can you find"
6396,XXV.,As soft as voices which are kind?)
6397,XXV.,
6398,XXVI.,XXVI.
6399,XXVI.,
6400,XXVI.,"And often, by the joy without"
6401,XXVI.,"And in us, overcome,"
6402,XXVI.,"We, through our musing, shall let float"
6403,XXVI.,"Such poems,--sitting dumb,--"
6404,XXVI.,As Pindar might have writ if he
6405,XXVI.,Had tended sheep in Arcady;
6406,XXVI.,
6407,XXVII.,XXVII.
6408,XXVII.,
6409,XXVII.,Or Æschylus--the pleasant fields
6410,XXVII.,"He died in, longer knowing;"
6411,XXVII.,"Or Homer, had men's sins and shields"
6412,XXVII.,Been lost in Meles flowing;

6417,XXVIII.,
6418,XXVIII.,"Choose me the cave most worthy choice,"
6419,XXVIII.,"To make a place for prayer,"

6421,XXVIII.,To pour our spirits there:

6425,XXIX.,XXIX.
6426,XXIX.,
6427,XXIX.,Gently yet strangely uttered words!
