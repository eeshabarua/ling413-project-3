227,IN EARLY SPRING,
228,IN EARLY SPRING,"O Spring, I know thee!  Seek for sweet surprise"
229,IN EARLY SPRING,In the young children's eyes.
230,IN EARLY SPRING,"But I have learnt the years, and know the yet"
231,IN EARLY SPRING,Leaf-folded violet.
232,IN EARLY SPRING,"Mine ear, awake to silence, can foretell"
233,IN EARLY SPRING,The cuckoo's fitful bell.
234,IN EARLY SPRING,I wander in a grey time that encloses
235,IN EARLY SPRING,June and the wild hedge-roses.
236,IN EARLY SPRING,A year's procession of the flowers doth pass
237,IN EARLY SPRING,"My feet, along the grass."
238,IN EARLY SPRING,"And all you wild birds silent yet, I know"
239,IN EARLY SPRING,"The notes that stir you so,"
240,IN EARLY SPRING,Your songs yet half devised in the dim dear
241,IN EARLY SPRING,Beginnings of the year.
242,IN EARLY SPRING,In these young days you meditate your part;
243,IN EARLY SPRING,I have it all by heart.
244,IN EARLY SPRING,
245,IN EARLY SPRING,I know the secrets of the seeds of flowers
246,IN EARLY SPRING,"Hidden and warm with showers,"
247,IN EARLY SPRING,"And how, in kindling Spring, the cuckoo shall"
248,IN EARLY SPRING,Alter his interval.
249,IN EARLY SPRING,But not a flower or song I ponder is
250,IN EARLY SPRING,"My own, but memory's."
251,IN EARLY SPRING,I shall be silent in those days desired
252,IN EARLY SPRING,Before world inspired.
253,IN EARLY SPRING,"O all brown birds, compose your old song-phrases,"
254,IN EARLY SPRING,"Earth, thy familiar daisies!"
255,IN EARLY SPRING,
256,IN EARLY SPRING,"A poet mused upon the dusky height,"
257,IN EARLY SPRING,"Between two stars towards night,"
258,IN EARLY SPRING,"His purpose in his heart.  I watched, a space,"
259,IN EARLY SPRING,The meaning of his face:
260,IN EARLY SPRING,"There was the secret, fled from earth and skies,"
261,IN EARLY SPRING,Hid in his grey young eyes.
262,IN EARLY SPRING,"My heart and all the Summer wait his choice,"
263,IN EARLY SPRING,And wonder for his voice.
264,IN EARLY SPRING,"Who shall foretell his songs, and who aspire"
265,IN EARLY SPRING,But to divine his lyre?
266,IN EARLY SPRING,"Sweet earth, we know thy dimmest mysteries,"
267,IN EARLY SPRING,But he is lord of his.

273,TO THE BELOVED,
274,TO THE BELOVED,"Oh, not more subtly silence strays"
275,TO THE BELOVED,"Amongst the winds, between the voices,"
276,TO THE BELOVED,"Mingling alike with pensive lays,"
277,TO THE BELOVED,"And with the music that rejoices,"
278,TO THE BELOVED,Than thou art present in my days.
279,TO THE BELOVED,
280,TO THE BELOVED,"My silence, life returns to thee"
281,TO THE BELOVED,In all the pauses of her breath.
282,TO THE BELOVED,Hush back to rest the melody
283,TO THE BELOVED,That out of thee awakeneth;
284,TO THE BELOVED,"And thou, wake ever, wake for me!"
285,TO THE BELOVED,
286,TO THE BELOVED,"Thou art like silence all unvexed,"
287,TO THE BELOVED,Though wild words part my soul from thee.
288,TO THE BELOVED,"Thou art like silence unperplexed,"
289,TO THE BELOVED,A secret and a mystery
290,TO THE BELOVED,Between one footfall and the next.
291,TO THE BELOVED,
292,TO THE BELOVED,Most dear pause in a mellow lay!
293,TO THE BELOVED,Thou art inwoven with every air.
294,TO THE BELOVED,"With thee the wildest tempests play,"
295,TO THE BELOVED,And snatches of thee everywhere
296,TO THE BELOVED,Make little heavens throughout a day.
297,TO THE BELOVED,
298,TO THE BELOVED,"Darkness and solitude shine, for me."
299,TO THE BELOVED,For life's fair outward part are rife
300,TO THE BELOVED,The silver noises; let them be.
301,TO THE BELOVED,It is the very soul of life
302,TO THE BELOVED,"Listens for thee, listens for thee."
303,TO THE BELOVED,
304,TO THE BELOVED,O pause between the sobs of cares;
305,TO THE BELOVED,O thought within all thought that is;
306,TO THE BELOVED,Trance between laughters unawares:
307,TO THE BELOVED,"Thou art the shape of melodies,"
308,TO THE BELOVED,And thou the ecstasy of prayers!

320,AN UNMARKED FESTIVAL,
321,AN UNMARKED FESTIVAL,"And we met: You knew not me,"

340,AN UNMARKED FESTIVAL,Of such days the year fulfils.

350,IN AUTUMN,
351,IN AUTUMN,"The leaves are many under my feet,"
352,IN AUTUMN,And drift one way.
353,IN AUTUMN,Their scent of death is weary and sweet.
354,IN AUTUMN,A flight of them is in the grey
355,IN AUTUMN,Where sky and forest meet.
356,IN AUTUMN,
357,IN AUTUMN,The low winds moan for dead sweet years;
358,IN AUTUMN,"The birds sing all for pain,"
359,IN AUTUMN,"Of a common thing, to weary ears,--"
360,IN AUTUMN,"Only a summer's fate of rain,"
361,IN AUTUMN,And a woman's fate of tears.
362,IN AUTUMN,
363,IN AUTUMN,I walk to love and life alone
364,IN AUTUMN,"Over these mournful places,"
365,IN AUTUMN,"Across the summer overthrown,"
366,IN AUTUMN,"The dead joys of these silent faces,"
367,IN AUTUMN,To claim my own.
368,IN AUTUMN,
369,IN AUTUMN,I know his heart has beat to bright
370,IN AUTUMN,Sweet loves gone by;
371,IN AUTUMN,I know the leaves that die to-night
372,IN AUTUMN,Once budded to the sky;
373,IN AUTUMN,And I shall die from his delight.
374,IN AUTUMN,
375,IN AUTUMN,"O leaves, so quietly ending now,"
376,IN AUTUMN,You heard the cuckoos sing.
377,IN AUTUMN,And I will grow upon my bough
378,IN AUTUMN,"If only for a Spring,"
379,IN AUTUMN,And fall when the rain is on my brow.
380,IN AUTUMN,
381,IN AUTUMN,"O tell me, tell me ere you die,"
382,IN AUTUMN,Is it worth the pain?
383,IN AUTUMN,"You bloomed so fair, you waved so high;"
384,IN AUTUMN,"Now that the sad days wane,"
385,IN AUTUMN,Are you repenting where you lie?
386,IN AUTUMN,
387,IN AUTUMN,"I lie amongst you, and I kiss"
388,IN AUTUMN,Your fragrance mouldering.
389,IN AUTUMN,"O dead delights, is it such bliss,"
390,IN AUTUMN,That tuneful Spring?
391,IN AUTUMN,"Is love so sweet, that comes to this?"
392,IN AUTUMN,
393,IN AUTUMN,Kiss me again as I kiss you;
394,IN AUTUMN,"Kiss me again,"
395,IN AUTUMN,"For all your tuneful nights of dew,"
396,IN AUTUMN,"In this your time of rain,"
397,IN AUTUMN,For all your kisses when Spring was new.
398,IN AUTUMN,
399,IN AUTUMN,"You will not, broken hearts; let be."
400,IN AUTUMN,I pass across your death
401,IN AUTUMN,"To a golden summer you shall not see,"
402,IN AUTUMN,And in your dying breath
403,IN AUTUMN,There is no benison for me.
404,IN AUTUMN,
405,IN AUTUMN,"There is an autumn yet to wane,"
406,IN AUTUMN,"There are leaves yet to fall,"
407,IN AUTUMN,"Which, when I kiss, may kiss again,"
408,IN AUTUMN,"And, pitied, pity me all for all,"
409,IN AUTUMN,And love me in mist and rain.
