255,III.,Close in arms or aëry wide.
256,III.,Banished is the white Foam-born
257,III.,"Not from here, nor under ban"
258,III.,"Phoebus lyrist, Phoebe’s horn,"
259,III.,Pipings of the reedy Pan.
260,III.,"Loved of Earth of old they were,"
261,III.,Loving did interpret her;
262,III.,And the sterner worship bars
263,III.,None whom Song has made her stars.
264,III.,You have seen the huntress moon
265,III.,"Radiantly facing dawn,"
266,III.,Dusky meads between them strewn
267,III.,Glimmering like downy awn:
268,III.,"Argent Westward glows the hunt,"
269,III.,East the blush about to climb;
270,III.,"One another fair they front,"
271,III.,"Transient, yet outshine the time;"
272,III.,Even as dewlight off the rose
273,III.,In the mind a jewel sows.
274,III.,Thus opposing grandeurs live
275,III.,Here if Beauty be their dower;
276,III.,"Doth she of her spirit give,"
277,III.,Fleetingness will spare her flower.
278,III.,"This is in the tune we play,"
279,III.,Which no spring of strength would quell;
280,III.,In subduing does not slay;
281,III.,"Guides the channel, guards the well:"
282,III.,"Tempered holds the young blood-heat,"
283,III.,"Yet through measured grave accord,"
284,III.,Hears the heart of wildness beat
285,III.,Like a centaur’s hoof on sward.
286,III.,"Drink the sense the notes infuse,"
287,III.,You a larger self will find:
288,III.,Sweetest fellowship ensues
289,III.,With the creatures of your kind.
290,III.,"Ay, and Love, if Love it be"
291,III.,"Flaming over _I_ and _ME_,"

294,III.,"Courtly dames are here to woo,"
295,III.,Knowing love if it be true.
296,III.,Reverence the blossom-shoot
297,III.,"Fervently, they are the fruit."
298,III.,"Mark them stepping, hear them talk,"
299,III.,"Goddess, is no myth inane,"
300,III.,You will say of those who walk
301,III.,In the woods of Westermain.
302,III.,Waters that from throat and thigh
303,III.,Dart the sun his arrows back;
304,III.,Leaves that on a woodland sigh
305,III.,Chat of secret things no lack;
306,III.,"Shadowy branch-leaves, waters clear,"
307,III.,Bare or veiled they move sincere;
308,III.,Not by slavish terrors tripped;
309,III.,"Being anew in nature dipped,"
310,III.,"Growths of what they step on, these;"
311,III.,With the roots the grace of trees.
312,III.,"Casket-breasts they give, nor hide,"
313,III.,"For a tyrant’s flattered pride,"
314,III.,"Mind, which nourished not by light,"
315,III.,Lurks the shuffling trickster sprite:
316,III.,Whereof are strange tales to tell;
317,III.,"Some in blood writ, tombed in bell."
318,III.,"Here the ancient battle ends,"
319,III.,"Joining two astonished friends,"
320,III.,Who the kiss can give and take
321,III.,With more warmth than in that world
322,III.,"Where the tiger claws the snake,"
323,III.,"Snake her tiger clasps infurled,"
324,III.,And the issue of their fight
325,III.,Peoples lands in snarling plight.
326,III.,Here her splendid beast she leads
327,III.,Silken-leashed and decked with weeds
328,III.,"Wild as he, but breathing faint"
329,III.,Sweetness of unfelt constraint.
330,III.,"Love, the great volcano, flings"
331,III.,Fires of lower Earth to sky;
332,III.,"Love, the sole permitted, sings"
333,III.,Sovereignly of _ME_ and _I_.
334,III.,"Bowers he has of sacred shade,"
335,III.,"Spaces of superb parade,"
336,III.,Voiceful ... But bring you a note
337,III.,"Wrangling, howsoe’er remote,"
338,III.,Discords out of discord spin
339,III.,Round and round derisive din:
340,III.,Sudden will a pallor pant
341,III.,Chill at screeches miscreant;
342,III.,"Owls or spectres, thick they flee;"
343,III.,Nightmare upon horror broods;
344,III.,"Hooded laughter, monkish glee,"
345,III.,Gaps the vital air.
346,III.,Enter these enchanted woods
347,III.,You who dare.
348,III.,
349,III.,
350,IV.,IV.
351,IV.,
352,IV.,You must love the light so well
353,IV.,That no darkness will seem fell.
354,IV.,Love it so you could accost
355,IV.,Fellowly a livid ghost.
356,IV.,"Whish! the phantom wisps away,"
357,IV.,Owns him smoke to cocks of day.
358,IV.,In your breast the light must burn
359,IV.,"Fed of you, like corn in quern"
360,IV.,Ever plumping while the wheel
361,IV.,Speeds the mill and drains the meal.
362,IV.,"Light to light sees little strange,"
363,IV.,Only features heavenly new;
364,IV.,"Then you touch the nerve of Change,"
365,IV.,Then of Earth you have the clue;
366,IV.,Then her two-sexed meanings melt
367,IV.,"Through you, wed the thought and felt."
368,IV.,Sameness locks no scurfy pond
369,IV.,"Here for Custom, crazy-fond:"
370,IV.,Change is on the wing to bud
371,IV.,Rose in brain from rose in blood.
372,IV.,Wisdom throbbing shall you see
373,IV.,Central in complexity;
374,IV.,From her pasture ’mid the beasts
375,IV.,"Rise to her ethereal feasts,"
376,IV.,"Not, though lightnings track your wit"
377,IV.,"Starward, scorning them you quit:"
378,IV.,For be sure the bravest wing
379,IV.,"Preens it in our common spring,"
380,IV.,"Thence along the vault to soar,"
381,IV.,"You with others, gathering more,"
382,IV.,"Glad of more, till you reject"
383,IV.,"Your proud title of elect,"
384,IV.,"Perilous even here, while few"
385,IV.,Roam the arched greenwood with you.
386,IV.,Heed that snare.
387,IV.,Muffled by his cavern-cowl
388,IV.,"Squats the scaly Dragon-fowl,"
389,IV.,"Who was lord ere light you drank,"
390,IV.,And lest blood of knightly rank
391,IV.,"Stream, let not your fair princess"
392,IV.,"Stray: he holds the leagues in stress,"
393,IV.,Watches keenly there.
394,IV.,Oft has he been riven; slain
395,IV.,Is no force in Westermain.
396,IV.,"Wait, and we shall forge him curbs,"
397,IV.,"Put his fangs to uses, tame,"
398,IV.,"Teach him, quick as cunning herbs,"
399,IV.,How to cure him sick and lame.
400,IV.,"Much restricted, much enringed,"
401,IV.,"Much he frets, the hooked and winged,"
402,IV.,Never known to spare.
403,IV.,’Tis enough: the name of Sage
404,IV.,"Hits no thing in nature, nought;"
405,IV.,"Man the least, save when grave Age"
406,IV.,From yon Dragon guards his thought.
407,IV.,Eye him when you hearken dumb
408,IV.,To what words from Wisdom come.
409,IV.,When she says how few are by
410,IV.,"Listening to her, eye his eye."
411,IV.,"Him shall Change, transforming late,"
412,IV.,Wonderously renovate.
413,IV.,Hug himself the creature may:
414,IV.,What he hugs is loathed decay.
415,IV.,"Crying, slip thy scales, and slough!"
416,IV.,Change will strip his armour off;
417,IV.,"Make of him who was all maw,"
418,IV.,"Inly only thrilling-shrewd,"
419,IV.,Such a servant as none saw
420,IV.,Through his days of dragonhood.
421,IV.,"Days when growling o’er his bone,"
422,IV.,Sharpened he for mine and thine;
423,IV.,Sensitive within alone;
424,IV.,Scaly as in clefts of pine.
425,IV.,"Change, the strongest son of Life,"
426,IV.,Has the Spirit here to wife.
427,IV.,"Lo, their young of vivid breed,"
428,IV.,"Bear the lights that onward speed,"
429,IV.,"Threading thickets, mounting glades,"
430,IV.,"Up the verdurous colonnades,"
431,IV.,"Round the fluttered curves, and down,"
432,IV.,"Out of sight of Earth’s blue crown,"
433,IV.,"Whither, in her central space,"
434,IV.,Spouts the Fount and Lure o’ the chase.
435,IV.,"Fount unresting, Lure divine!"
436,IV.,There meet all: too late look most.
437,IV.,"Fire in water hued as wine,"
438,IV.,Springs amid a shadowy host;
439,IV.,"Circled: one close-headed mob,"
440,IV.,"Breathless, scanning divers heaps"
441,IV.,"Where a Heart begins to throb,"
442,IV.,"Where it ceases, slow, with leaps"
443,IV.,"And ’tis very strange, ’tis said,"
444,IV.,How you spy in each of them
445,IV.,"Semblance of that Dragon red,"
446,IV.,As the oak in bracken-stem.
447,IV.,And ’tis said how each and each:
448,IV.,"Which commences, which subsides:"
449,IV.,First my Dragon! doth beseech
450,IV.,Her who food for all provides.
451,IV.,And she answers with no sign;
452,IV.,Utters neither yea nor nay;
453,IV.,Fires the water hued as wine;
454,IV.,Kneads another spark in clay.
455,IV.,Terror is about her hid;
456,IV.,Silence of the thunders locked;
457,IV.,Lightnings lining the shut lid;
458,IV.,Fixity on quaking rocked.
459,IV.,"Lo, you look at Flow and Drought"
460,IV.,Interflashed and interwrought:
461,IV.,"Ended is begun, begun"
462,IV.,"Ended, quick as torrents run."
463,IV.,Young Impulsion spouts to sink;
464,IV.,Luridness and lustre link;
465,IV.,’Tis your come and go of breath;
466,IV.,"Mirrored pants the Life, the Death;"
467,IV.,Each of either reaped and sown:
468,IV.,Rosiest rosy wanes to crone.
469,IV.,See you so? your senses drift;
470,IV.,’Tis a shuttle weaving swift.
471,IV.,"Look with spirit past the sense,"
472,IV.,Spirit shines in permanence.
473,IV.,"That is She, the view of whom"
474,IV.,"Is the dust within the tomb,"
475,IV.,"Is the inner blush above,"
476,IV.,"Look to loathe, or look to love;"
477,IV.,"Think her Lump, or know her Flame;"
478,IV.,"Dread her scourge, or read her aim;"
479,IV.,Shoot your hungers from their nerve;
480,IV.,"Or, in her example, serve."
481,IV.,Some have found her sitting grave;
482,IV.,"Laughing, some; or, browed with sweat,"
483,IV.,Hurling dust of fool and knave
484,IV.,In a hissing smithy’s jet.
485,IV.,More it were not well to speak;
486,IV.,"Burn to see, you need but seek."
487,IV.,Once beheld she gives the key
488,IV.,"Airing every doorway, she."
489,IV.,Little can you stop or steer
490,IV.,Ere of her you are the sëer.
491,IV.,"On the surface she will witch,"
492,IV.,"Rendering Beauty yours, but gaze"
493,IV.,"Under, and the soul is rich"
494,IV.,"Past computing, past amaze."

500,IV.,"Lighting Pain to its mad source,"
501,IV.,"Scaring Fear till Fear escapes,"

503,IV.,Then your spirit will perceive
504,IV.,Fleshly seed of fleshly sins;
505,IV.,"Where the passions interweave,"
506,IV.,How the serpent tangle spins
507,IV.,"Of the sense of Earth misprised,"
508,IV.,Brainlessly unrecognised;
509,IV.,"She being Spirit in her clods,"
510,IV.,Footway to the God of Gods.
511,IV.,"Then for you are pleasures pure,"

513,IV.,Not the wanton beckoning flags
514,IV.,"Which, of flattery and delight,"
515,IV.,Wax to the grim Habit-Hags
516,IV.,Riding souls of men to night:
517,IV.,"Pleasures that through blood run sane,"

527,IV.,Earth that Triad is: she hides

534,IV.,Till your little sun shall set;
535,IV.,Leaving her the future task:
536,IV.,Loving her too well to ask.
537,IV.,"Eglantine that climbs the yew,"
538,IV.,She her darkest wreathes for those
539,IV.,"Knowing her the Ever-new,"
540,IV.,And themselves the kin o’ the rose.
541,IV.,"Life, the chisel, axe and sword,"
542,IV.,Wield who have her depths explored:
543,IV.,"Life, the dream, shall be their robe,"
544,IV.,Large as air about the globe;
545,IV.,"Life, the question, hear its cry"
546,IV.,Echoed with concordant Why;
547,IV.,"Life, the small self-dragon ramped,"
548,IV.,Thrill for service to be stamped.
549,IV.,"Ay, and over every height"
550,IV.,Life for them shall wave a wand:
551,IV.,"That, the last, where sits affright,"
552,IV.,Homely shows the stream beyond.
553,IV.,"Love the light and be its lynx,"
554,IV.,You will track her and attain;
555,IV.,Read her as no cruel Sphinx
556,IV.,In the woods of Westermain.
557,IV.,Daily fresh the woods are ranged;
558,IV.,"Glooms which otherwhere appal,"
559,IV.,"Sounded: here, their worths exchanged,"
560,IV.,Urban joins with pastoral:
561,IV.,"Little lost, save what may drop"
562,IV.,"Husk-like, and the mind preserves."
563,IV.,"Natural overgrowths they lop,"
564,IV.,"Yet from nature neither swerves,"
565,IV.,Trained or savage: for this cause:

567,IV.,"Have in Earth their feeding root,"
568,IV.,Mind of man and bent of brute.
569,IV.,Hear that song; both wild and ruled.
570,IV.,Hear it: is it wail or mirth?
571,IV.,"Ordered, bubbled, quite unschooled?"
572,IV.,"None, and all: it springs of Earth."
573,IV.,O but hear it! ’tis the mind;
574,IV.,"Mind that with deep Earth unites,"
575,IV.,Round the solid trunk to wind
576,IV.,Rings of clasping parasites.
577,IV.,Music have you there to feed
578,IV.,Simplest and most soaring need.

583,IV.,Whence the tidal world is viewed
584,IV.,"As a sea of windy wheat,"
585,IV.,"Momently black, barren, rude;"
586,IV.,"Golden-brown, for harvest meet,"
587,IV.,Dragon-reaped from folly-sown;
588,IV.,Bride-like to the sickle-blade:
589,IV.,"Quick it varies, while the moan,"
590,IV.,"Moan of a sad creature strayed,"
591,IV.,Chiefly is its voice. So flesh
592,IV.,Conjures tempest-flails to thresh
593,IV.,Good from worthless. Some clear lamps
594,IV.,Light it; more of dead marsh-damps.
595,IV.,"Monster is it still, and blind,"
596,IV.,Fit but to be led by Pain.

615,IV.,"Are you of the stiff, the dry,"
616,IV.,Cursing the not understood;
617,IV.,Grasp you with the monster’s claws;
618,IV.,Govern with his truncheon-saws;
619,IV.,"Hate, the shadow of a grain;"

629,IV.,Hideousness on hoof and horn
630,IV.,"Tumbles, yapping in her track:"

640,IV.,Out of Him whose eyes are out:
641,IV.,"Multitudes on multitudes,"
642,IV.,Drenched in wallowing devilry:
643,IV.,"And you ask where you may be,"

754,III.,His eyeballs up to the sight:
755,III.,"The embrace of the Twain, of whom"
756,III.,"To men are their day, their night,"
757,III.,Mellow fruits and the shearing tomb:
758,III.,Our Lady of the Sheaves
759,III.,"And the Lily of Hades, the Sweet"
760,III.,Of Enna: he saw through leaves
761,III.,The Mother and Daughter meet.
762,III.,"They stood by the chariot-wheel,"
763,III.,"Embraced, very tall, most like"
764,III.,"Fellow poplars, wind-taken, that reel"
765,III.,Down their shivering columns and strike
766,III.,"Head to head, crossing throats: and apart,"
767,III.,"For the feast of the look, they drew,"
768,III.,Which Darkness no longer could thwart;
769,III.,"And they broke together anew,"
770,III.,"Exulting to tears, flower and bud."
771,III.,But the mate of the Rayless was grave:
772,III.,"She smiled like Sleep on its flood,"
773,III.,That washes of all we crave:
774,III.,Like the trance of eyes awake
775,III.,"And the spirit enshrouded, she cast"
776,III.,The wan underworld on the lake.
777,III.,"They were so, and they passed."
778,III.,
779,III.,
780,IV.,IV.
781,IV.,
782,IV.,"He tells it, who knew the law"
783,IV.,Upon mortals: he stood alive
784,IV.,Declaring that this he saw:
785,IV.,"He could see, and survive."
786,IV.,
787,IV.,
788,V.,V.
789,V.,
790,V.,Now the youth was not ware of the beams
791,V.,"With the grasses intertwined,"
792,V.,"For each thing seen, as in dreams,"
793,V.,"Came stepping to rear through his mind,"
794,V.,Till it struck his remembered prayer
795,V.,To be witness of this which had flown
796,V.,"Like a smoke melted thinner than air,"
797,V.,That the vacancy doth disown.
798,V.,"And viewing a maiden, he thought"
799,V.,"It might now be morn, and afar"
800,V.,Within him the memory wrought
801,V.,Of a something that slipped from the car
802,V.,"When those, the august, moved by:"
803,V.,"Perchance a scarf, and perchance"
804,V.,"This maiden. She did not fly,"
805,V.,Nor started at his advance:
806,V.,"She looked, as when infinite thirst"
807,V.,"Pants pausing to bless the springs,"
808,V.,"Refreshed, unsated. Then first"
809,V.,He trembled with awe of the things
810,V.,"He had seen; and he did transfer,"
811,V.,"Divining and doubting in turn,"
812,V.,His reverence unto her;
813,V.,Nor asked what he crouched to learn:
814,V.,"The whence of her, whither, and why"
815,V.,"Her presence there, and her name,"
816,V.,Her parentage: under which sky
817,V.,"Her birth, and how hither she came,"
818,V.,"So young, a virgin, alone,"
819,V.,"Unfriended, having no fear,"
820,V.,"As Oreads have; no moan,"
821,V.,Like the lost upon earth; no tear;
822,V.,"Not a sign of the torch in the blood,"
823,V.,Though her stature had reached the height
824,V.,When mantles a tender rud
825,V.,"In maids that of youths have sight,"
826,V.,If maids of our seed they be:
827,V.,For he said: A glad vision art thou!
828,V.,And she answered him: Thou to me!
829,V.,As men utter a vow.
830,V.,
831,V.,
832,VI.,VI.
833,VI.,
834,VI.,"Then said she, quick as the cries"
835,VI.,Of the rainy cranes: Light! light!
836,VI.,"And Helios rose in her eyes,"
837,VI.,"That were full as the dew-balls bright,"
838,VI.,Relucent to him as dews
839,VI.,"Unshaded. Breathing, she sent"
840,VI.,"Her voice to the God of the Muse,"
841,VI.,"And along the vale it went,"
842,VI.,"Strange to hear: not thin, not shrill;"
843,VI.,"Sweet, but no young maid’s throat:"
844,VI.,The echo beyond the hill
845,VI.,Ran falling on half the note:
846,VI.,And under the shaken ground
847,VI.,Where the Hundred-headed groans
848,VI.,"By the roots of great Ætna bound,"
849,VI.,As of him were hollow tones
850,VI.,Of wondering roared: a tale
851,VI.,Repeated to sunless halls.
852,VI.,But now off the face of the vale
853,VI.,"Shadows fled in a breath, and the walls"
854,VI.,"Of the lake’s rock-head were gold,"
855,VI.,"And the breast of the lake, that swell"
856,VI.,Of the crestless long wave rolled
857,VI.,"To shore-bubble, pebble and shell."
858,VI.,A morning of radiant lids
859,VI.,O’er the dance of the earth opened wide:
860,VI.,"The bees chose their flowers, the snub kids"
861,VI.,"Upon hindlegs went sportive, or plied,"
862,VI.,"Nosing, hard at the dugs to be filled:"
863,VI.,"There was milk, honey, music to make:"
864,VI.,Up their branches the little birds billed:
865,VI.,"Chirrup, drone, bleat and buzz ringed the lake."
866,VI.,"O shining in sunlight, chief"
867,VI.,"After water and water’s caress,"
868,VI.,"Was the young bronze-orange leaf,"
869,VI.,"That clung to the tree as a tress,"
870,VI.,Shooting lucid tendrils to wed
871,VI.,"With the vine-hook tree or pole,"
872,VI.,Like Arachne launched out on her thread.
873,VI.,Then the maiden her dusky stole
874,VI.,"In the span of the black-starred zone,"
875,VI.,Gathered up for her footing fleet.
876,VI.,As one that had toil of her own
877,VI.,She followed the lines of wheat
878,VI.,"Tripping straight through the field, green blades,"
879,VI.,"To the groves of olive gray,"
880,VI.,"Downy-gray, golden-tinged: and to glades"
881,VI.,Where the pear-blossom thickens the spray
882,VI.,"In a night, like the snow-packed storm:"
883,VI.,"Pear, apple, almond, plum:"
884,VI.,"Not wintry now: pushing, warm!"
885,VI.,"And she touched them with finger and thumb,"
886,VI.,"As the vine-hook closes: she smiled,"
887,VI.,"Recounting again and again,"
888,VI.,"Corn, wine, fruit, oil! like a child,"
889,VI.,With the meaning known to men.
890,VI.,For hours in the track of the plough
891,VI.,"And the pruning-knife she stepped,"
892,VI.,"And of how the seed works, and of how"
893,VI.,"Yields the soil, she seemed adept."
894,VI.,"Then she murmured that name of the dearth,"
895,VI.,"The Beneficent, Hers, who bade"
896,VI.,Our husbandmen sow for the birth
897,VI.,Of the grain making earth full glad.
898,VI.,She murmured that Other’s: the dirge
899,VI.,Of life-light: for whose dark lap
900,VI.,Our locks are clipped on the verge
901,VI.,Of the realm where runs no sap.
902,VI.,She said: We have looked on both!
903,VI.,And her eyes had a wavering beam
904,VI.,"Of various lights, like the froth"
905,VI.,Of the storm-swollen ravine stream
906,VI.,In flame of the bolt. What links
907,VI.,Were these which had made him her friend?
908,VI.,"He eyed her, as one who drinks,"
909,VI.,And would drink to the end.
910,VI.,
911,VI.,
912,VII.,VII.
913,VII.,
914,VII.,"Now the meadows with crocus besprent,"
915,VII.,"And the asphodel woodsides she left,"
916,VII.,"And the lake-slopes, the ravishing scent"
917,VII.,"Of narcissus, dark-sweet, for the cleft"
918,VII.,"That tutors the torrent-brook,"
919,VII.,Delaying its forceful spleen
920,VII.,With many a wind and crook
921,VII.,Through rock to the broad ravine.
922,VII.,"By the hyacinth-bells in the brakes,"
923,VII.,"And the shade-loved white windflower, half hid,"
924,VII.,And the sun-loving lizards and snakes
925,VII.,"On the cleft’s barren ledges, that slid"
926,VII.,"Out of sight, smooth as waterdrops, all,"
927,VII.,At a snap of twig or bark
928,VII.,"In the track of the foreign foot-fall,"
929,VII.,"She climbed to the pine-forest dark,"
930,VII.,Overbrowing an emerald chine
931,VII.,"Of the grass-billows. Thence, as a wreath,"
932,VII.,"Running poplar and cypress to pine,"
933,VII.,"The lake-banks are seen, and beneath,"
934,VII.,"Vineyard, village, groves, rivers, towers, farms,"
935,VII.,"The citadel watching the bay,"
936,VII.,"The bay with the town in its arms,"
937,VII.,The town shining white as the spray
938,VII.,"Of the sapphire sea-wave on the rock,"
939,VII.,"Where the rock stars the girdle of sea,"
940,VII.,"White-ringed, as the midday flock,"
941,VII.,"Clipped by heat, rings the round of the tree."
942,VII.,That hour of the piercing shaft
943,VII.,"Transfixes bough-shadows, confused"
944,VII.,"In veins of fire, and she laughed,"
945,VII.,"With her quiet mouth amused,"
946,VII.,"To see the whole flock, adroop,"
947,VII.,"Asleep, hug the tree-stem as one,"
948,VII.,Imperceptibly filling the loop
949,VII.,Of its shade at a slant of sun.
950,VII.,"The pipes under pent of the crag,"
951,VII.,"Where the goatherds in piping recline,"
952,VII.,"Have whimsical stops, burst and flag"
953,VII.,Uncorrected as outstretched swine:
954,VII.,"For the fingers are slack and unsure,"
955,VII.,And the wind issues querulous:--thorns
956,VII.,"And snakes!--but she listened demure,"
957,VII.,Comparing day’s music with morn’s.
958,VII.,Of the gentle spirit that slips
959,VII.,"From the bark of the tree she discoursed,"
960,VII.,"And of her of the wells, whose lips"
961,VII.,"Are coolness enchanting, rock-sourced."
962,VII.,"And much of the sacred loon,"
963,VII.,"The frolic, the Goatfoot God,"
964,VII.,For stories of indolent noon
965,VII.,"In the pineforest’s odorous nod,"
966,VII.,"She questioned, not knowing: he can"
967,VII.,"Be waspish, irascible, rude,"
968,VII.,"He is oftener friendly to man,"
969,VII.,And ever to beasts and their brood.
970,VII.,"For the which did she love him well,"
971,VII.,"She said, and his pipes of the reed,"
972,VII.,His twitched lips puffing to tell
973,VII.,"In music his tears and his need,"
974,VII.,Against the sharp catch of his hurt.
975,VII.,"Not as shepherds of Pan did she speak,"
976,VII.,"Nor spake as the schools, to divert,"
977,VII.,"But fondly, perceiving him weak"
978,VII.,"Before Gods, and to shepherds a fear,"
979,VII.,"A holiness, horn and heel."
980,VII.,All this she had learnt in her ear
981,VII.,"From Callistes, and taught him to feel."
982,VII.,"Yea, the solemn divinity flushed"
983,VII.,"Through the shaggy brown skin of the beast,"
984,VII.,"And the steeps where the cataract rushed,"
985,VII.,"And the wilds where the forest is priest,"
986,VII.,"Were his temple to clothe him in awe,"
987,VII.,While she spake: ’twas a wonder: she read
988,VII.,The haunts of the beak and the claw
989,VII.,"As plain as the land of bread,"
990,VII.,"But Cities and martial States,"
991,VII.,"Whither soon the youth veered his theme,"
992,VII.,Were impervious barrier-gates
993,VII.,"To her: and that ship, a trireme,"
994,VII.,"Nearing harbour, scarce wakened her glance,"
995,VII.,Though he dwelt on the message it bore
996,VII.,Of sceptre and sword and lance
997,VII.,"To the bee-swarms black on the shore,"
998,VII.,"Which were audible almost,"
999,VII.,So black they were. It befel
1000,VII.,That he called up the warrior host
1001,VII.,Of the Song pouring hydromel
1002,VII.,"In thunder, the wide-winged Song,"
1003,VII.,And he named with his boyish pride
1004,VII.,"The heroes, the noble throng"
1005,VII.,"Past Acheron now, foul tide!"
1006,VII.,With his joy of the godlike band
1007,VII.,"And the verse divine, he named"
1008,VII.,"The chiefs pressing hot on the strand,"
1009,VII.,"Seen of Gods, of Gods aided, and maimed."
1010,VII.,The fleetfoot and ireful; the King;
1011,VII.,"Him, the prompter in stratagem,"
1012,VII.,"Many-shifted and masterful: Sing,"
1013,VII.,O Muse! But she cried: Not of them!
1014,VII.,"She breathed as if breath had failed,"
1015,VII.,"And her eyes, while she bade him desist,"
1016,VII.,"Held the lost-to-light ghosts gray-mailed,"
1017,VII.,As you see the gray river-mist
1018,VII.,Hold shapes on the yonder bank.
1019,VII.,"A moment her body waned,"
1020,VII.,The light of her sprang and sank:
1021,VII.,"Clear feature, and she breathed deep."
1022,VII.,"She wore the wan smile he had seen,"
1023,VII.,"As the flow of the river of Sleep,"
1024,VII.,On the mouth of the Shadow-Queen.
1025,VII.,"In sunlight she craved to bask,"
1026,VII.,Saying: Life! And who was she? who?
1027,VII.,"Of what issue? He dared not ask,"
1028,VII.,For that partly he knew.
1029,VII.,
1030,VII.,
1031,VIII.,VIII.
1032,VIII.,
1033,VIII.,A noise of the hollow ground
1034,VIII.,Turned the eye to the ear in debate:
1035,VIII.,Not the soft overflowing of sound
1036,VIII.,"Of the pines, ranked, lofty, straight,"
1037,VIII.,"Barely swayed to some whispers remote,"
1038,VIII.,Some swarming whispers above:
1039,VIII.,"Not the pines with the faint airs afloat,"
1040,VIII.,Hush-hushing the nested-dove:
1041,VIII.,"It was not the pines, or the rout"
1042,VIII.,"Oft heard from mid-forest in chase,"
1043,VIII.,But the long muffled roar of a shout
1044,VIII.,Subterranean. Sharp grew her face.
1045,VIII.,"She rose, yet not moved by affright;"
1046,VIII.,’Twas rather good haste to use
1047,VIII.,Her holiday of delight
1048,VIII.,In the beams of the God of the Muse.
1049,VIII.,"And the steeps of the forest she crossed,"
1050,VIII.,On its dry red sheddings and cones
1051,VIII.,"Up the paths by roots green-mossed,"
1052,VIII.,"Spotted amber, and old mossed stones."
1053,VIII.,Then out where the brook-torrent starts
1054,VIII.,"To her leap, and from bend to curve"
1055,VIII.,A hurrying elbow darts
1056,VIII.,"For the instant-glancing swerve,"
1057,VIII.,"Decisive, with violent will"
1058,VIII.,"In the action formed, like hers,"
1059,VIII.,"The maiden’s, ascending; and still"
1060,VIII.,"Ascending, the bud of the furze,"
1061,VIII.,"The broom, and all blue-berried shoots"
1062,VIII.,"Of stubborn and prickly kind,"
1063,VIII.,"The juniper flat on its roots,"
1064,VIII.,"The dwarf rhododaphne, behind"
1065,VIII.,"She left, and the mountain sheep"
1066,VIII.,"Far behind, goat, herbage and flower."
1067,VIII.,"The island was hers, and the deep,"
1068,VIII.,"All heaven, a golden hour."
1069,VIII.,Then with wonderful voice that rang
1070,VIII.,"Through air as the swan’s nigh death,"
1071,VIII.,"Of the glory of Light she sang,"
1072,VIII.,She sang of the rapture of Breath.
1073,VIII.,"Nor ever, says he who heard,"
1074,VIII.,"Heard Earth in her boundaries broad,"
1075,VIII.,From bosom of singer or bird
1076,VIII.,A sweetness thus rich of the God
1077,VIII.,Whose harmonies always are sane.
1078,VIII.,"She sang of furrow and seed,"
1079,VIII.,"The burial, birth of the grain,"
1080,VIII.,"The growth, and the showers that feed,"
1081,VIII.,And the green blades waxing mature
1082,VIII.,For the husbandman’s armful brown.
1083,VIII.,"O, the song in its burden ran pure,"
1084,VIII.,And burden to song was a crown.
1085,VIII.,"Callistes, a singer, skilled"
1086,VIII.,"In the gift he could measure and praise,"
1087,VIII.,"By a rival’s art was thrilled,"
1088,VIII.,"Though she sang but a Song of Days,"
1089,VIII.,Where the husbandman’s toil and strife
1090,VIII.,Little varies to strife and toil:
1091,VIII.,"But the milky kernel of life,"
1092,VIII.,"With her numbered: corn, wine, fruit, oil!"
1093,VIII.,The song did give him to eat:
1094,VIII.,"Gave the first rapt vision of Good,"
1095,VIII.,And the fresh young sense of Sweet:
1096,VIII.,"The grace of the battle for food,"
1097,VIII.,With the issue Earth cannot refuse
1098,VIII.,When men to their labour are sworn.
1099,VIII.,’Twas a song of the God of the Muse
1100,VIII.,To the forehead of Morn.
1101,VIII.,
1102,VIII.,
1103,IX.,IX.
1104,IX.,
1105,IX.,"Him loved she. Lo, now was he veiled:"
1106,IX.,Over sea stood a swelled cloud-rack:
1107,IX.,"The fishing-boat havenward sailed,"
1108,IX.,"Bent abeam, with a whitened track,"
1109,IX.,"Surprised, fast hauling the net"
1110,IX.,"As it flew: sea dashed, earth shook."
1111,IX.,She said: Is it night? O not yet!
1112,IX.,With a travail of thoughts in her look.
1113,IX.,The mountain heaved up to its peak:
1114,IX.,Sea darkened: earth gathered her fowl:
1115,IX.,Of bird or of branch rose the shriek.
1116,IX.,Night? but never so fell a scowl
1117,IX.,"Wore night, nor the sky since then"
1118,IX.,"When ocean ran swallowing shore,"
1119,IX.,And the Gods looked down for men.
1120,IX.,Broke tempest with that stern roar
1121,IX.,"Never yet, save when black on the whirl"
1122,IX.,Rode wrath of a sovereign Power.
1123,IX.,"Then the youth and the shuddering girl,"
1124,IX.,"Dim as shades in the angry shower,"
1125,IX.,Joined hands and descended a maze
1126,IX.,Of the paths that were racing alive
1127,IX.,"Round boulder and bush, cleaving ways,"
1128,IX.,"Incessant, with sound of a hive."
1129,IX.,The height was a fountain-urn
1130,IX.,"Pouring streams, and the whole solid height"
1131,IX.,"Leaped, chasing at every turn"
1132,IX.,The pair in one spirit of flight
1133,IX.,"To the folding pine-forest. Yet here,"
1134,IX.,"Like the pause to things hunted, in doubt,"
1135,IX.,The stillness bred spectral fear
1136,IX.,"Of the awfulness ranging without,"
1137,IX.,"And imminent. Downward they fled,"
1138,IX.,"From under the haunted roof,"
1139,IX.,To the valley aquake with the tread
1140,IX.,"Of an iron-resounding hoof,"
1141,IX.,As of legions of thunderful horse
1142,IX.,Broken loose and in line tramping hard.
1143,IX.,For the rage of a hungry force
1144,IX.,Roamed blind of its mark over sward:
1145,IX.,They saw it rush dense in the cloak
1146,IX.,Of its travelling swathe of steam;
1147,IX.,All the vale through a thin thread-smoke
1148,IX.,Was thrown back to distance extreme:
1149,IX.,"And dull the full breast of it blinked,"
1150,IX.,"Like a buckler of steel breathed o’er,"
1151,IX.,"Diminished, in strangeness distinct,"
1152,IX.,"Glowing cold, unearthly, hoar:"
1153,IX.,"An Enna of fields beyond sun,"
1154,IX.,"Out of light, in a lurid web,"
1155,IX.,And the traversing fury spun
1156,IX.,Up and down with a wave’s flow and ebb;
1157,IX.,"As the wave breaks to grasp and to spurn,"
1158,IX.,"Retire, and in ravenous greed,"
1159,IX.,"Inveterate, swell its return."
1160,IX.,"Up and down, as if wringing from speed"
1161,IX.,"Sights that made the unsighted appear,"
1162,IX.,"Delude and dissolve, on it scoured."
1163,IX.,"Lo, a sea upon land held career"
1164,IX.,Through the plain of the vale half-devoured.
1165,IX.,Callistes of home and escape
1166,IX.,"Muttered swiftly, unwitting of speech."
1167,IX.,"She gazed at the Void of shape,"
1168,IX.,"She put her white hand to his reach,"
1169,IX.,Saying: Now have we looked on the Three.
1170,IX.,"And divided from day, from night,"
1171,IX.,"From air that is breath, stood she,"
1172,IX.,"Like the vale, out of light."
1173,IX.,
1174,IX.,
1175,X.,X.
1176,X.,
1177,X.,Then again in disorderly words
1178,X.,"He muttered of home, and was mute,"
1179,X.,With the heart of the cowering birds
1180,X.,Ere they burst off the fowler’s foot.
1181,X.,He gave her some redness that streamed
1182,X.,Through her limbs in a flitting glow.
1183,X.,"The sigh of our life she seemed,"
1184,X.,The bliss of it clothing in woe.
1185,X.,Frailer than flower when the round
1186,X.,Of the sickle encircles it: strong
1187,X.,"To tell of the things profound,"
1188,X.,"Our inmost uttering song,"
1189,X.,Unspoken. So stood she awhile
1190,X.,"In the gloom of the terror afield,"
1191,X.,And the silence about her smile
1192,X.,Said more than of tongue is revealed.
1193,X.,I have breathed: I have gazed: I have been:
1194,X.,It said: and not joylessly shone
1195,X.,The remembrance of light through the screen
1196,X.,Of a face that seemed shadow and stone.
1197,X.,"She led the youth trembling, appalled,"
1198,X.,To the lake-banks he saw sink and rise
1199,X.,"Like a panic-struck breast. Then she called,"
1200,X.,And the hurricane blackness had eyes.
1201,X.,It launched like the Thunderer’s bolt.
1202,X.,"Pale she drooped, and the youth by her side"
1203,X.,Would have clasped her and dared a revolt
1204,X.,Sacrilegious as ever defied
1205,X.,"High Olympus, but vainly for strength"
1206,X.,His compassionate heart shook a frame
1207,X.,Stricken rigid to ice all its length.
1208,X.,On amain the black traveller came.
1209,X.,"Lo, a chariot, cleaving the storm,"
1210,X.,"Clove the fountaining lake with a plough,"
1211,X.,And the lord of the steeds was in form
1212,X.,"He, the God of implacable brow,"
1213,X.,Darkness: he: he in person: he raged
1214,X.,Through the wave like a boar of the wilds
1215,X.,"From the hunters and hounds disengaged,"
1216,X.,And a name shouted hoarsely: his child’s.
1217,X.,Horror melted in anguish to hear.
1218,X.,"Lo, the wave hissed apart for the path"
1219,X.,"Of the terrible Charioteer,"

1256,XII.,There was none for the desolate youth
1257,XII.,Devoted to mourn and to crave.
1258,XII.,Of the secret he had divined
1259,XII.,Of his friend of a day would he rave:
1260,XII.,How for light of our earth she pined:
1261,XII.,"For the olive, the vine and the wheat,"
1262,XII.,Burning through with inherited fire:
1263,XII.,"And when Mother went Mother to meet,"
1264,XII.,She was prompted by simple desire
1265,XII.,In the day-destined car to have place
1266,XII.,"At the skirts of the Goddess, unseen,"
1267,XII.,And be drawn to the dear earth’s face.
1268,XII.,She was fire for the blue and the green
1269,XII.,"Of our earth, dark fire; athirst"
1270,XII.,"As a seed of her bosom for dawn,"
1271,XII.,White air that had robed and nursed
1272,XII.,Her mother. Now was she gone
1273,XII.,"With the Silent, the God without tear,"
1274,XII.,Like a bud peeping out of its sheath
1275,XII.,To be sundered and stamped with the sere.
1276,XII.,"And Callistes to her beneath,"
1277,XII.,"As she to our beams, extinct,"
1278,XII.,Strained arms: he was shade of her shade
1279,XII.,In division so were they linked.
1280,XII.,But the song which had betrayed
1281,XII.,Her flight to the cavernous ear
1282,XII.,For its own keenly wakeful: that song
1283,XII.,"Of the sowing and reaping, and cheer"
1284,XII.,Of the husbandman’s heart made strong
1285,XII.,Through droughts and deluging rains
1286,XII.,With his faith in the Great Mother’s love:
1287,XII.,"O the joy of the breath she sustains,"
1288,XII.,"And the lyre of the light above,"
1289,XII.,"And the first rapt vision of Good,"
1290,XII.,And the fresh young sense of Sweet:
1291,XII.,That song the youth ever pursued
1292,XII.,In the track of her footing fleet.
1293,XII.,For men to be profited much
1294,XII.,By her day upon earth did he sing:
1295,XII.,"Of her voice, and her steps, and her touch"
1296,XII.,"On the blossoms of tender Spring,"
1297,XII.,Immortal: and how in her soul
1298,XII.,"She is with them, and tearless abides,"
1299,XII.,Folding grain of a love for one goal
1300,XII.,"In patience, past flowing of tides."
1301,XII.,"And if unto him she was tears,"
1302,XII.,He wept not: he wasted within:
1303,XII.,"Seeming sane in the song, to his peers,"
1304,XII.,Only crazed where the cravings begin.
1305,XII.,Our Lady of Gifts prized he less
1306,XII.,Than her issue in darkness: the dim
1307,XII.,Lost Skiágeneia’s caress
1308,XII.,Of our earth made it richest for him.
1309,XII.,"And for that was a curse on him raised,"
1310,XII.,"And he withered rathe, dry to his prime,"
1311,XII.,Though the bounteous Giver be praised
1312,XII.,Through the island with rites of old time
1313,XII.,"Exceedingly fervent, and reaped"
1314,XII.,"Veneration for teachings devout,"
1315,XII.,"Pious hymns when the corn-sheaves are heaped,"
1316,XII.,"And the wine-presses ruddily spout,"
1317,XII.,And the olive and apple are juice
1318,XII.,At a touch light as hers lost below.
1319,XII.,Whatsoever to men is of use
1320,XII.,"Sprang his worship of them who bestow,"
1321,XII.,In a measure of songs unexcelled:
1322,XII.,But that soul loving earth and the sun
1323,XII.,From her home of the shadows he held
1324,XII.,For his beacon where beam there is none:
1325,XII.,"And to join her, or have her brought back,"
