183,LIFE OF KEATS,moderate sale'. It contains the flower of his poetic production and is
184,LIFE OF KEATS,"perhaps, altogether, one of the most marvellous volumes ever issued from"
185,LIFE OF KEATS,the press.
186,LIFE OF KEATS,
187,LIFE OF KEATS,"But in spite of the maturity of Keats's work when he was twenty-five, he"
188,LIFE OF KEATS,had been in no sense a precocious child. Born in 1795 in the city of
189,LIFE OF KEATS,"London, the son of a livery-stable keeper, he was brought up amid"
190,LIFE OF KEATS,surroundings and influences by no means calculated to awaken poetic
191,LIFE OF KEATS,genius.
192,LIFE OF KEATS,
193,LIFE OF KEATS,"He was the eldest of five--four boys, one of whom died in infancy, and a"
194,LIFE OF KEATS,girl younger than all; and he and his brothers George and Tom were
195,LIFE OF KEATS,educated at a private school at Enfield. Here John was at first
196,LIFE OF KEATS,"distinguished more for fighting than for study, whilst his bright,"
197,LIFE OF KEATS,"brave, generous nature made him popular with masters and boys."
198,LIFE OF KEATS,
199,LIFE OF KEATS,"Soon after he had begun to go to school his father died, and when he was"
200,LIFE OF KEATS,fifteen the children lost their mother too. Keats was passionately
201,LIFE OF KEATS,devoted to his mother; during her last illness he would sit up all night
202,LIFE OF KEATS,"with her, give her her medicine, and even cook her food himself. At her"
203,LIFE OF KEATS,death he was brokenhearted.
204,LIFE OF KEATS,
205,LIFE OF KEATS,"The children were now put under the care of two guardians, one of whom,"
206,LIFE OF KEATS,"Mr. Abbey, taking the sole responsibility, immediately removed John from"
207,LIFE OF KEATS,school and apprenticed him for five years to a surgeon at Edmonton.
208,LIFE OF KEATS,
209,LIFE OF KEATS,"Whilst thus employed Keats spent all his leisure time in reading, for"
210,LIFE OF KEATS,which he had developed a great enthusiasm during his last two years at
211,LIFE OF KEATS,"school. There he had devoured every book that came in his way,"
212,LIFE OF KEATS,especially rejoicing in stories of the gods and goddesses of ancient
213,LIFE OF KEATS,Greece. At Edmonton he was able to continue his studies by borrowing
214,LIFE OF KEATS,"books from his friend Charles Cowden Clarke, the son of his"
215,LIFE OF KEATS,"schoolmaster, and he often went over to Enfield to change his books and"
216,LIFE OF KEATS,to discuss those which he had been reading. On one of these occasions
217,LIFE OF KEATS,"Cowden Clarke introduced him to Spenser, to whom so many poets have owed"
218,LIFE OF KEATS,their first inspiration that he has been called 'the poets' poet'; and
219,LIFE OF KEATS,"it was then, apparently, that Keats was first prompted to write."
220,LIFE OF KEATS,
221,LIFE OF KEATS,"When he was nineteen, a year before his apprenticeship came to an end,"
222,LIFE OF KEATS,"he quarrelled with his master, left him, and continued his training in"
223,LIFE OF KEATS,"London as a student at St. Thomas's Hospital and Guy's. Gradually,"
224,LIFE OF KEATS,"however, during the months that followed, though he was an industrious"
225,LIFE OF KEATS,"and able medical student, Keats came to realize that poetry was his true"
226,LIFE OF KEATS,"vocation; and as soon as he was of age, in spite of the opposition of"
227,LIFE OF KEATS,"his guardian, he decided to abandon the medical profession and devote"
228,LIFE OF KEATS,his life to literature.
229,LIFE OF KEATS,
230,LIFE OF KEATS,If Mr. Abbey was unsympathetic Keats was not without encouragement from
231,LIFE OF KEATS,"others. His brothers always believed in him whole-heartedly, and his"
232,LIFE OF KEATS,exceptionally lovable nature had won him many friends. Amongst these
233,LIFE OF KEATS,"friends two men older than himself, each famous in his own sphere, had"
234,LIFE OF KEATS,special influence upon him.
235,LIFE OF KEATS,
236,LIFE OF KEATS,"One of them, Leigh Hunt, was something of a poet himself and a pleasant"
237,LIFE OF KEATS,"prose-writer. His encouragement did much to stimulate Keats's genius,"
238,LIFE OF KEATS,but his direct influence on his poetry was wholly bad. Leigh Hunt's was
239,LIFE OF KEATS,"not a deep nature; his poetry is often trivial and sentimental, and his"
240,LIFE OF KEATS,easy conversational style is intolerable when applied to a great theme.
241,LIFE OF KEATS,"To this man's influence, as well as to the surroundings of his youth,"
242,LIFE OF KEATS,are doubtless due the occasional flaws of taste in Keats's early work.
243,LIFE OF KEATS,
244,LIFE OF KEATS,"The other, Haydon, was an artist of mediocre creative talent but great"
245,LIFE OF KEATS,aims and amazing belief in himself. He had a fine critical faculty which
246,LIFE OF KEATS,"was shown in his appreciation of the Elgin marbles, in opposition to the"
247,LIFE OF KEATS,most respected authorities of his day. Mainly through his insistence
248,LIFE OF KEATS,they were secured for the nation which thus owes him a boundless debt of
249,LIFE OF KEATS,gratitude. He helped to guide and direct Keats's taste by his
250,LIFE OF KEATS,enthusiastic exposition of these masterpieces of Greek sculpture.
251,LIFE OF KEATS,
252,LIFE OF KEATS,"In 1817 Keats published his first volume of poems, including 'Sleep and"
253,LIFE OF KEATS,Poetry' and the well-known lines 'I stood tiptoe upon a little hill'.
254,LIFE OF KEATS,"With much that is of the highest poetic value, many memorable lines and"
255,LIFE OF KEATS,"touches of his unique insight into nature, the volume yet showed"
256,LIFE OF KEATS,"considerable immaturity. It contained indeed, if we except one perfect"
257,LIFE OF KEATS,"sonnet, rather a series of experiments than any complete and finished"
258,LIFE OF KEATS,"work. There were abundant faults for those who liked to look for them,"
259,LIFE OF KEATS,though there were abundant beauties too; and the critics and the public
260,LIFE OF KEATS,chose rather to concentrate their attention on the former. The volume
261,LIFE OF KEATS,"was therefore anything but a success; but Keats was not discouraged, for"
262,LIFE OF KEATS,"he saw many of his own faults more clearly than did his critics, and"
263,LIFE OF KEATS,felt his power to outgrow them.
264,LIFE OF KEATS,
265,LIFE OF KEATS,Immediately after this Keats went to the Isle of Wight and thence to
266,LIFE OF KEATS,Margate that he might study and write undisturbed. On May 10th he wrote
267,LIFE OF KEATS,"to Haydon--'I never quite despair, and I read Shakespeare--indeed I"
268,LIFE OF KEATS,"shall, I think, never read any other book much'. We have seen Keats"
269,LIFE OF KEATS,"influenced by Spenser and by Leigh Hunt: now, though his love for"
270,LIFE OF KEATS,"Spenser continued, Shakespeare's had become the dominant influence."
271,LIFE OF KEATS,Gradually he came too under the influence of Wordsworth's philosophy of
272,LIFE OF KEATS,"poetry and life, and later his reading of Milton affected his style to"
273,LIFE OF KEATS,"some extent, but Shakespeare's influence was the widest, deepest and"
274,LIFE OF KEATS,"most lasting, though it is the hardest to define. His study of other"
275,LIFE OF KEATS,poets left traces upon his work in turns of phrase or turns of thought:
276,LIFE OF KEATS,"Shakespeare permeated his whole being, and his influence is to be"
277,LIFE OF KEATS,"detected not in a resemblance of style, for Shakespeare can have no"
278,LIFE OF KEATS,"imitators, but in a broadening view of life, and increased humanity."
279,LIFE OF KEATS,
280,LIFE OF KEATS,No poet could have owed his education more completely to the English
281,LIFE OF KEATS,poets than did John Keats. His knowledge of Latin was slight--he knew no
282,LIFE OF KEATS,"Greek, and even the classical stories which he loved and constantly"
283,LIFE OF KEATS,"used, came to him almost entirely through the medium of Elizabethan"
284,LIFE OF KEATS,translations and allusions. In this connexion it is interesting to read
285,LIFE OF KEATS,"his first fine sonnet, in which he celebrates his introduction to the"
286,LIFE OF KEATS,greatest of Greek poets in the translation of the rugged and forcible
287,LIFE OF KEATS,"Elizabethan, George Chapman:--"
288,LIFE OF KEATS,
289,LIFE OF KEATS,_On first looking into Chapman's Homer._
290,LIFE OF KEATS,
291,LIFE OF KEATS,"Much have I travelled in the realms of gold,"
292,LIFE OF KEATS,And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
293,LIFE OF KEATS,Round many western islands have I been
294,LIFE OF KEATS,Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
295,LIFE OF KEATS,Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
296,LIFE OF KEATS,That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne;
297,LIFE OF KEATS,Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
298,LIFE OF KEATS,Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
299,LIFE OF KEATS,Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
300,LIFE OF KEATS,When a new planet swims into his ken;
301,LIFE OF KEATS,Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
302,LIFE OF KEATS,He stared at the Pacific--and all his men
303,LIFE OF KEATS,Look'd at each other with a wild surmise--
304,LIFE OF KEATS,"Silent, upon a peak in Darien."
305,LIFE OF KEATS,
306,LIFE OF KEATS,"Of the work upon which he was now engaged, the narrative-poem of"
307,LIFE OF KEATS,"_Endymion_, we may give his own account to his little sister Fanny in a"
308,LIFE OF KEATS,"letter dated September 10th, 1817:--"
309,LIFE OF KEATS,
310,LIFE OF KEATS,'Perhaps you might like to know what I am writing about. I will tell
311,LIFE OF KEATS,you. Many years ago there was a young handsome Shepherd who fed his
312,LIFE OF KEATS,flocks on a Mountain's Side called Latmus--he was a very contemplative
313,LIFE OF KEATS,sort of a Person and lived solitary among the trees and Plains little
314,LIFE OF KEATS,thinking that such a beautiful Creature as the Moon was growing mad in
315,LIFE OF KEATS,Love with him.--However so it was; and when he was asleep she used to
316,LIFE OF KEATS,come down from heaven and admire him excessively for a long time; and at
317,LIFE OF KEATS,last could not refrain from carrying him away in her arms to the top of
318,LIFE OF KEATS,that high Mountain Latmus while he was a dreaming--but I dare say you
319,LIFE OF KEATS,have read this and all the other beautiful tales which have come down
320,LIFE OF KEATS,from the ancient times of that beautiful Greece.'
321,LIFE OF KEATS,
322,LIFE OF KEATS,"On his return to London he and his brother Tom, always delicate and now"
323,LIFE OF KEATS,"quite an invalid, took lodgings at Hampstead. Here Keats remained for"
324,LIFE OF KEATS,"some time, harassed by the illness of his brother and of several of his"
325,LIFE OF KEATS,friends; and in June he was still further depressed by the departure of
326,LIFE OF KEATS,his brother George to try his luck in America.
327,LIFE OF KEATS,
328,LIFE OF KEATS,"In April, 1818, _Endymion_ was finished. Keats was by no means"
329,LIFE OF KEATS,"satisfied with it but preferred to publish it as it was, feeling it to"
330,LIFE OF KEATS,be 'as good as I had power to make it by myself'.--'I will write
331,LIFE OF KEATS,independently' he says to his publisher--'I have written independently
332,LIFE OF KEATS,_without judgment_. I may write independently and _with judgment_
333,LIFE OF KEATS,"hereafter. In _Endymion_ I leaped headlong into the sea, and thereby"
334,LIFE OF KEATS,"have become better acquainted with the soundings, the quicksands, and"
335,LIFE OF KEATS,"the rocks, than if I had stayed upon the green shore, and piped a silly"
336,LIFE OF KEATS,"pipe, and took tea and comfortable advice.' He published it with a"
337,LIFE OF KEATS,preface modestly explaining to the public his own sense of its
338,LIFE OF KEATS,imperfection. Nevertheless a storm of abuse broke upon him from the
339,LIFE OF KEATS,critics who fastened upon all the faults of the poem--the diffuseness of
340,LIFE OF KEATS,"the story, its occasional sentimentality and the sometimes fantastic"
341,LIFE OF KEATS,"coinage of words,[xiii:1] and ignored the extraordinary beauties of"
342,LIFE OF KEATS,which it is full.
343,LIFE OF KEATS,
344,LIFE OF KEATS,"Directly after the publication of _Endymion_, and before the appearance"
345,LIFE OF KEATS,"of these reviews, Keats started with a friend, Charles Brown, for a"
346,LIFE OF KEATS,walking tour in Scotland. They first visited the English lakes and
347,LIFE OF KEATS,"thence walked to Dumfries, where they saw the house of Burns and his"
348,LIFE OF KEATS,"grave. They entered next the country of Meg Merrilies, and from"
349,LIFE OF KEATS,Kirkcudbrightshire crossed over to Ireland for a few days. On their
350,LIFE OF KEATS,"return they went north as far as Argyleshire, whence they sailed to"
351,LIFE OF KEATS,"Staffa and saw Fingal's cave, which, Keats wrote, 'for solemnity and"
352,LIFE OF KEATS,grandeur far surpasses the finest Cathedral.' They then crossed Scotland
353,LIFE OF KEATS,"through Inverness, and Keats returned home by boat from Cromarty."
354,LIFE OF KEATS,
355,LIFE OF KEATS,"His letters home are at first full of interest and enjoyment, but a"
356,LIFE OF KEATS,"'slight sore throat', contracted in 'a most wretched walk of"
357,LIFE OF KEATS,"thirty-seven miles across the Isle of Mull', proved very troublesome and"
358,LIFE OF KEATS,finally cut short his holiday. This was the beginning of the end. There
359,LIFE OF KEATS,"was consumption in the family: Tom was dying of it; and the cold, wet,"
360,LIFE OF KEATS,and over-exertion of his Scotch tour seems to have developed the fatal
361,LIFE OF KEATS,tendency in Keats himself.
362,LIFE OF KEATS,
363,LIFE OF KEATS,"From this time forward he was never well, and no good was done to either"
364,LIFE OF KEATS,his health or spirits by the task which now awaited him of tending on
365,LIFE OF KEATS,"his dying brother. For the last two or three months of 1818, until"
366,LIFE OF KEATS,"Tom's death in December, he scarcely left the bedside, and it was well"
367,LIFE OF KEATS,"for him that his friend, Charles Armitage Brown, was at hand to help and"
368,LIFE OF KEATS,comfort him after the long strain. Brown persuaded Keats at once to
369,LIFE OF KEATS,"leave the house, with its sad associations, and to come and live with"
370,LIFE OF KEATS,him.
371,LIFE OF KEATS,
372,LIFE OF KEATS,Before long poetry absorbed Keats again; and the first few months of
373,LIFE OF KEATS,"1819 were the most fruitful of his life. Besides working at _Hyperion_,"
374,LIFE OF KEATS,"which he had begun during Tom's illness, he wrote _The Eve of St."
375,LIFE OF KEATS,"Agnes_, _The Eve of St. Mark_, _La Belle Dame Sans Merci_, and nearly"
376,LIFE OF KEATS,all his famous odes.
377,LIFE OF KEATS,
378,LIFE OF KEATS,Troubles however beset him. His friend Haydon was in difficulties and
379,LIFE OF KEATS,"tormenting him, poor as he was, to lend him money; the state of his"
380,LIFE OF KEATS,"throat gave serious cause for alarm; and, above all, he was consumed by"
381,LIFE OF KEATS,"an unsatisfying passion for the daughter of a neighbour, Mrs. Brawne."
382,LIFE OF KEATS,"She had rented Brown's house whilst they were in Scotland, and had now"
383,LIFE OF KEATS,"moved to a street near by. Miss Fanny Brawne returned his love, but she"
384,LIFE OF KEATS,seems never to have understood his nature or his needs. High-spirited
385,LIFE OF KEATS,and fond of pleasure she did not apparently allow the thought of her
386,LIFE OF KEATS,invalid lover to interfere much with her enjoyment of life. She would
387,LIFE OF KEATS,"not, however, abandon her engagement, and she probably gave him all"
388,LIFE OF KEATS,"which it was in her nature to give. Ill-health made him, on the other"
389,LIFE OF KEATS,"hand, morbidly dissatisfied and suspicious; and, as a result of his"
390,LIFE OF KEATS,"illness and her limitations, his love throughout brought him"
391,LIFE OF KEATS,restlessness and torment rather than peace and comfort.
392,LIFE OF KEATS,
393,LIFE OF KEATS,"Towards the end of July he went to Shanklin and there, in collaboration"
394,LIFE OF KEATS,"with Brown, wrote a play, _Otho the Great_. Brown tells us how they used"
395,LIFE OF KEATS,"to sit, one on either side of a table, he sketching out the scenes and"
396,LIFE OF KEATS,"handing each one, as the outline was finished, to Keats to write. As"
397,LIFE OF KEATS,Keats never knew what was coming it was quite impossible that the
398,LIFE OF KEATS,"characters should be adequately conceived, or that the drama should be a"
399,LIFE OF KEATS,united whole. Nevertheless there is much that is beautiful and promising
400,LIFE OF KEATS,"in it. It should not be forgotten that Keats's 'greatest ambition' was,"
401,LIFE OF KEATS,"in his own words, 'the writing of a few fine plays'; and, with the"
402,LIFE OF KEATS,"increasing humanity and grasp which his poetry shows, there is no reason"
403,LIFE OF KEATS,"to suppose that, had he lived, he would not have fulfilled it."
404,LIFE OF KEATS,
405,LIFE OF KEATS,"At Shanklin, moreover, he had begun to write _Lamia_, and he continued"
406,LIFE OF KEATS,"it at Winchester. Here he stayed until the middle of October, excepting"
407,LIFE OF KEATS,a few days which he spent in London to arrange about the sending of some
408,LIFE OF KEATS,money to his brother in America. George had been unsuccessful in his
409,LIFE OF KEATS,"commercial enterprises, and Keats, in view of his family's ill-success,"
410,LIFE OF KEATS,"determined temporarily to abandon poetry, and by reviewing or journalism"
411,LIFE OF KEATS,"to support himself and earn money to help his brother. Then, when he"
412,LIFE OF KEATS,"could afford it, he would return to poetry."
413,LIFE OF KEATS,
414,LIFE OF KEATS,"Accordingly he came back to London, but his health was breaking down,"
415,LIFE OF KEATS,"and with it his resolution. He tried to re-write _Hyperion_, which he"
416,LIFE OF KEATS,felt had been written too much under the influence of Milton and in 'the
417,LIFE OF KEATS,artist's humour'. The same independence of spirit which he had shown in
418,LIFE OF KEATS,the publication of _Endymion_ urged him now to abandon a work the style
419,LIFE OF KEATS,of which he did not feel to be absolutely his own. The re-cast he wrote
420,LIFE OF KEATS,"in the form of a vision, calling it _The Fall of Hyperion_, and in so"
421,LIFE OF KEATS,doing he added much to his conception of the meaning of the story. In no
422,LIFE OF KEATS,poem does he show more of the profoundly philosophic spirit which
423,LIFE OF KEATS,characterizes many of his letters. But it was too late; his power was
424,LIFE OF KEATS,"failing and, in spite of the beauty and interest of some of his"
425,LIFE OF KEATS,"additions, the alterations are mostly for the worse."
426,LIFE OF KEATS,
427,LIFE OF KEATS,Whilst _The Fall of Hyperion_ occupied his evenings his mornings were
428,LIFE OF KEATS,"spent over a satirical fairy-poem, _The Cap and Bells_, in the metre of"
429,LIFE OF KEATS,"the _Faerie Queene_. This metre, however, was ill-suited to the subject;"
430,LIFE OF KEATS,"satire was not natural to him, and the poem has little intrinsic merit."
431,LIFE OF KEATS,
432,LIFE OF KEATS,"Neither this nor the re-cast of _Hyperion_ was finished when, in"
433,LIFE OF KEATS,"February, 1820, he had an attack of illness in which the first definite"
434,LIFE OF KEATS,symptom of consumption appeared. Brown tells how he came home on the
435,LIFE OF KEATS,"evening of Thursday, February 3rd, in a state of high fever, chilled"
436,LIFE OF KEATS,from having ridden outside the coach on a bitterly cold day. 'He mildly
437,LIFE OF KEATS,and instantly yielded to my request that he should go to bed . . . On
438,LIFE OF KEATS,"entering the cold sheets, before his head was on the pillow, he slightly"
439,LIFE OF KEATS,"coughed, and I heard him say--""that is blood from my mouth"". I went"
440,LIFE OF KEATS,towards him: he was examining a single drop of blood upon the sheet.
441,LIFE OF KEATS,"""Bring me the candle, Brown, and let me see this blood."" After regarding"
442,LIFE OF KEATS,it steadfastly he looked up in my face with a calmness of expression
443,LIFE OF KEATS,"that I can never forget, and said, ""I know the colour of that blood;--it"
444,LIFE OF KEATS,is arterial blood; I cannot be deceived in that colour; that drop of
445,LIFE OF KEATS,"blood is my death warrant;--I must die.""'"
446,LIFE OF KEATS,
447,LIFE OF KEATS,"He lived for another year, but it was one long dying: he himself called"
448,LIFE OF KEATS,it his 'posthumous life'.
449,LIFE OF KEATS,
450,LIFE OF KEATS,Keats was one of the most charming of letter-writers. He had that rare
451,LIFE OF KEATS,quality of entering sympathetically into the mind of the friend to whom
452,LIFE OF KEATS,"he was writing, so that his letters reveal to us much of the character"
453,LIFE OF KEATS,of the recipient as well as of the writer. In the long journal-letters
454,LIFE OF KEATS,which he wrote to his brother and sister-in-law in America he is
455,LIFE OF KEATS,"probably most fully himself, for there he is with the people who knew"
456,LIFE OF KEATS,him best and on whose understanding and sympathy he could rely. But in
457,LIFE OF KEATS,none is the beauty of his character more fully revealed than in those to
458,LIFE OF KEATS,"his little sister Fanny, now seventeen years old, and living with their"
459,LIFE OF KEATS,"guardian, Mr. Abbey. He had always been very anxious that they should"
460,LIFE OF KEATS,"'become intimately acquainted, in order', as he says, 'that I may not"
461,LIFE OF KEATS,"only, as you grow up, love you as my only Sister, but confide in you as"
462,LIFE OF KEATS,my dearest friend.' In his most harassing times he continued to write to
463,LIFE OF KEATS,"her, directing her reading, sympathizing in her childish troubles, and"
464,LIFE OF KEATS,constantly thinking of little presents to please her. Her health was to
465,LIFE OF KEATS,"him a matter of paramount concern, and in his last letters to her we"
466,LIFE OF KEATS,find him reiterating warnings to take care of herself--'You must be
467,LIFE OF KEATS,careful always to wear warm clothing not only in Frost but in a
468,LIFE OF KEATS,Thaw.'--'Be careful to let no fretting injure your health as I have
469,LIFE OF KEATS,suffered it--health is the greatest of blessings--with _health_ and
470,LIFE OF KEATS,"_hope_ we should be content to live, and so you will find as you grow"
471,LIFE OF KEATS,"older.' The constant recurrence of this thought becomes, in the light of"
472,LIFE OF KEATS,"his own sufferings, almost unbearably pathetic."
473,LIFE OF KEATS,
474,LIFE OF KEATS,During the first months of his illness Keats saw through the press his
475,LIFE OF KEATS,"last volume of poetry, of which this is a reprint. The praise which it"
476,LIFE OF KEATS,received from reviewers and public was in marked contrast to the
477,LIFE OF KEATS,"scornful reception of his earlier works, and would have augured well for"
478,LIFE OF KEATS,the future. But Keats was past caring much for poetic fame. He dragged
479,LIFE OF KEATS,"on through the summer, with rallies and relapses, tormented above all by"
480,LIFE OF KEATS,the thought that death would separate him from the woman he loved. Only
481,LIFE OF KEATS,"Brown, of all his friends, knew what he was suffering, and it seems that"
482,LIFE OF KEATS,he only knew fully after they were parted.
483,LIFE OF KEATS,
484,LIFE OF KEATS,"The doctors warned Keats that a winter in England would kill him, so in"
485,LIFE OF KEATS,"September, 1820, he left London for Naples, accompanied by a young"
486,LIFE OF KEATS,"artist, Joseph Severn, one of his many devoted friends. Shelley, who"
487,LIFE OF KEATS,"knew him slightly, invited him to stay at Pisa, but Keats refused. He"
488,LIFE OF KEATS,"had never cared for Shelley, though Shelley seems to have liked him,"
489,LIFE OF KEATS,"and, in his invalid state, he naturally shrank from being a burden to a"
490,LIFE OF KEATS,mere acquaintance.
491,LIFE OF KEATS,
492,LIFE OF KEATS,"It was as they left England, off the coast of Dorsetshire, that Keats"
493,LIFE OF KEATS,wrote his last beautiful sonnet on a blank leaf of his folio copy of
494,LIFE OF KEATS,"Shakespeare, facing _A Lover's Complaint_:--"
495,LIFE OF KEATS,
496,LIFE OF KEATS,Bright star! would I were steadfast as thou art--
497,LIFE OF KEATS,"Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night,"
498,LIFE OF KEATS,"And watching, with eternal lids apart,"
499,LIFE OF KEATS,"Like Nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,"
500,LIFE OF KEATS,The moving waters at their priest-like task
501,LIFE OF KEATS,"Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,"
502,LIFE OF KEATS,Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask
503,LIFE OF KEATS,Of snow upon the mountains and the moors--
504,LIFE OF KEATS,"No--yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,"
505,LIFE OF KEATS,"Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,"
506,LIFE OF KEATS,"To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,"
507,LIFE OF KEATS,"Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,"
508,LIFE OF KEATS,"Still, still to hear her tender taken breath,"
509,LIFE OF KEATS,And so live ever--or else swoon to death.
510,LIFE OF KEATS,
511,LIFE OF KEATS,"The friends reached Rome, and there Keats, after a brief rally, rapidly"
512,LIFE OF KEATS,"became worse. Severn nursed him with desperate devotion, and of Keats's"
513,LIFE OF KEATS,sweet considerateness and patience he could never say enough. Indeed
514,LIFE OF KEATS,such was the force and lovableness of Keats's personality that though
515,LIFE OF KEATS,Severn lived fifty-eight years longer it was for the rest of his life a
516,LIFE OF KEATS,chief occupation to write and draw his memories of his friend.
517,LIFE OF KEATS,
518,LIFE OF KEATS,"On February 23rd, 1821, came the end for which Keats had begun to long."
519,LIFE OF KEATS,He died peacefully in Severn's arms. On the 26th he was buried in the
520,LIFE OF KEATS,beautiful little Protestant cemetery of which Shelley said that it 'made
521,LIFE OF KEATS,one in love with death to think that one should be buried in so sweet a
522,LIFE OF KEATS,place'.
523,LIFE OF KEATS,
524,LIFE OF KEATS,Great indignation was felt at the time by those who attributed his
525,LIFE OF KEATS,"death, in part at least, to the cruel treatment which he had received"
526,LIFE OF KEATS,"from the critics. Shelley, in _Adonais_, withered them with his scorn,"
527,LIFE OF KEATS,"and Byron, in _Don Juan_, had his gibe both at the poet and at his"
528,LIFE OF KEATS,"enemies. But we know now how mistaken they were. Keats, in a normal"
529,LIFE OF KEATS,"state of mind and body, was never unduly depressed by harsh or unfair"
530,LIFE OF KEATS,"criticism. 'Praise or blame,' he wrote, 'has but a momentary effect on"
531,LIFE OF KEATS,the man whose love of beauty in the abstract makes him a severe critic
532,LIFE OF KEATS,"on his own works,' and this attitude he consistently maintained"
533,LIFE OF KEATS,throughout his poetic career. No doubt the sense that his genius was
534,LIFE OF KEATS,unappreciated added something to the torment of mind which he suffered
535,LIFE OF KEATS,"in Rome, and on his death-bed he asked that on his tombstone should be"
536,LIFE OF KEATS,inscribed the words 'Here lies one whose name was writ in water'. But it
537,LIFE OF KEATS,"was apparently not said in bitterness, and the rest of the"
538,LIFE OF KEATS,inscription[xxiii:1] expresses rather the natural anger of his friends
539,LIFE OF KEATS,at the treatment he had received than the mental attitude of the poet
540,LIFE OF KEATS,himself.
541,LIFE OF KEATS,
542,LIFE OF KEATS,Fully to understand him we must read his poetry with the commentary of
543,LIFE OF KEATS,"his letters which reveal in his character elements of humour,"
544,LIFE OF KEATS,"clear-sighted wisdom, frankness, strength, sympathy and tolerance. So"
545,LIFE OF KEATS,"doing we shall enter into the mind and heart of the friend who, speaking"
546,LIFE OF KEATS,"for many, described Keats as one 'whose genius I did not, and do not,"
547,LIFE OF KEATS,more fully admire than I entirely loved the man'.

610,PART I.,"Sceptre, and mantle, clasp'd with dewy gem,"
611,PART I.,Frighted away the Dryads and the Fauns

617,PART I.,"Of his great summoner, and made retreat"
618,PART I.,Into a forest on the shores of Crete.
619,PART I.,For somewhere in that sacred island dwelt
620,PART I.,"A nymph, to whom all hoofed Satyrs knelt;"
621,PART I.,At whose white feet the languid Tritons poured
622,PART I.,"Pearls, while on land they wither'd and adored."
623,PART I.,"Fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont,"
624,PART I.,"And in those meads where sometime she might haunt,"
625,PART I.,"Were strewn rich gifts, unknown to any Muse,"
626,PART I.,Though Fancy's casket were unlock'd to choose.               20
627,PART I.,"Ah, what a world of love was at her feet!"
628,PART I.,"So Hermes thought, and a celestial heat"
629,PART I.,"Burnt from his winged heels to either ear,"
630,PART I.,"That from a whiteness, as the lily clear,"
631,PART I.,"Blush'd into roses 'mid his golden hair,"
632,PART I.,Fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare.
633,PART I.,"From vale to vale, from wood to wood, he flew,"
634,PART I.,"Breathing upon the flowers his passion new,"
635,PART I.,"And wound with many a river to its head,"
636,PART I.,To find where this sweet nymph prepar'd her secret bed:      30
637,PART I.,"In vain; the sweet nymph might nowhere be found,"
638,PART I.,"And so he rested, on the lonely ground,"
639,PART I.,"Pensive, and full of painful jealousies"
640,PART I.,"Of the Wood-Gods, and even the very trees."
641,PART I.,"There as he stood, he heard a mournful voice,"
642,PART I.,"Such as once heard, in gentle heart, destroys"
643,PART I.,All pain but pity: thus the lone voice spake:
644,PART I.,"""When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake!"
645,PART I.,"When move in a sweet body fit for life,"
646,PART I.,"And love, and pleasure, and the ruddy strife                 40"
647,PART I.,"Of hearts and lips! Ah, miserable me!"""
648,PART I.,"The God, dove-footed, glided silently"

650,PART I.,"The taller grasses and full-flowering weed,"
651,PART I.,"Until he found a palpitating snake,"
652,PART I.,"Bright, and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake."
653,PART I.,
654,PART I.,"She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue,"
655,PART I.,"Vermilion-spotted, golden, green, and blue;"
656,PART I.,"Striped like a zebra, freckled like a pard,"
657,PART I.,"Eyed like a peacock, and all crimson barr'd;                 50"
658,PART I.,"And full of silver moons, that, as she breathed,"
659,PART I.,"Dissolv'd, or brighter shone, or interwreathed"
660,PART I.,Their lustres with the gloomier tapestries--
661,PART I.,"So rainbow-sided, touch'd with miseries,"
662,PART I.,"She seem'd, at once, some penanced lady elf,"
663,PART I.,"Some demon's mistress, or the demon's self."
664,PART I.,Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire
665,PART I.,"Sprinkled with stars, like Ariadne's tiar:"
666,PART I.,"Her head was serpent, but ah, bitter-sweet!"
667,PART I.,She had a woman's mouth with all its pearls complete:        60
668,PART I.,And for her eyes: what could such eyes do there
669,PART I.,"But weep, and weep, that they were born so fair?"
670,PART I.,As Proserpine still weeps for her Sicilian air.
671,PART I.,"Her throat was serpent, but the words she spake"
672,PART I.,"Came, as through bubbling honey, for Love's sake,"
673,PART I.,"And thus; while Hermes on his pinions lay,"
674,PART I.,Like a stoop'd falcon ere he takes his prey.
675,PART I.,
676,PART I.,"""Fair Hermes, crown'd with feathers, fluttering light,"
677,PART I.,I had a splendid dream of thee last night:
678,PART I.,"I saw thee sitting, on a throne of gold,                     70"
679,PART I.,"Among the Gods, upon Olympus old,"
680,PART I.,The only sad one; for thou didst not hear
681,PART I.,"The soft, lute-finger'd Muses chaunting clear,"
682,PART I.,"Nor even Apollo when he sang alone,"
683,PART I.,"Deaf to his throbbing throat's long, long melodious moan."
684,PART I.,"I dreamt I saw thee, robed in purple flakes,"
685,PART I.,"Break amorous through the clouds, as morning breaks,"
686,PART I.,"And, swiftly as a bright Phoebean dart,"
687,PART I.,Strike for the Cretan isle; and here thou art!
688,PART I.,"Too gentle Hermes, hast thou found the maid?""                80"
689,PART I.,Whereat the star of Lethe not delay'd
690,PART I.,"His rosy eloquence, and thus inquired:"
691,PART I.,"""Thou smooth-lipp'd serpent, surely high inspired!"
692,PART I.,"Thou beauteous wreath, with melancholy eyes,"
693,PART I.,"Possess whatever bliss thou canst devise,"
694,PART I.,"Telling me only where my nymph is fled,--"
695,PART I.,"Where she doth breathe!"" ""Bright planet, thou hast said,"""
696,PART I.,"Return'd the snake, ""but seal with oaths, fair God!"""
697,PART I.,"""I swear,"" said Hermes, ""by my serpent rod,"
698,PART I.,"And by thine eyes, and by thy starry crown!""                 90"
699,PART I.,"Light flew his earnest words, among the blossoms blown."
700,PART I.,Then thus again the brilliance feminine:
701,PART I.,"""Too frail of heart! for this lost nymph of thine,"
702,PART I.,"Free as the air, invisibly, she strays"
703,PART I.,About these thornless wilds; her pleasant days
704,PART I.,She tastes unseen; unseen her nimble feet
705,PART I.,Leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet;
706,PART I.,"From weary tendrils, and bow'd branches green,"
707,PART I.,"She plucks the fruit unseen, she bathes unseen:"
708,PART I.,And by my power is her beauty veil'd                        100
709,PART I.,"To keep it unaffronted, unassail'd"
710,PART I.,"By the love-glances of unlovely eyes,"
711,PART I.,"Of Satyrs, Fauns, and blear'd Silenus' sighs."
712,PART I.,"Pale grew her immortality, for woe"
713,PART I.,"Of all these lovers, and she grieved so"
714,PART I.,"I took compassion on her, bade her steep"
715,PART I.,"Her hair in weird syrops, that would keep"
716,PART I.,"Her loveliness invisible, yet free"
717,PART I.,"To wander as she loves, in liberty."
718,PART I.,"Thou shalt behold her, Hermes, thou alone,                  110"
719,PART I.,"If thou wilt, as thou swearest, grant my boon!"""
720,PART I.,"Then, once again, the charmed God began"
721,PART I.,"An oath, and through the serpent's ears it ran"
722,PART I.,"Warm, tremulous, devout, psalterian."
723,PART I.,"Ravish'd, she lifted her Circean head,"
724,PART I.,"Blush'd a live damask, and swift-lisping said,"
725,PART I.,"""I was a woman, let me have once more"
726,PART I.,"A woman's shape, and charming as before."
727,PART I.,I love a youth of Corinth--O the bliss!
728,PART I.,"Give me my woman's form, and place me where he is.          120"
729,PART I.,"Stoop, Hermes, let me breathe upon thy brow,"
730,PART I.,"And thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now."""
731,PART I.,"The God on half-shut feathers sank serene,"
732,PART I.,"She breath'd upon his eyes, and swift was seen"
733,PART I.,Of both the guarded nymph near-smiling on the green.
734,PART I.,"It was no dream; or say a dream it was,"
735,PART I.,"Real are the dreams of Gods, and smoothly pass"
736,PART I.,Their pleasures in a long immortal dream.
737,PART I.,"One warm, flush'd moment, hovering, it might seem"
738,PART I.,"Dash'd by the wood-nymph's beauty, so he burn'd;            130"
739,PART I.,"Then, lighting on the printless verdure, turn'd"
740,PART I.,"To the swoon'd serpent, and with languid arm,"
741,PART I.,"Delicate, put to proof the lythe Caducean charm."
742,PART I.,"So done, upon the nymph his eyes he bent"
743,PART I.,"Full of adoring tears and blandishment,"
744,PART I.,"And towards her stept: she, like a moon in wane,"
745,PART I.,"Faded before him, cower'd, nor could restrain"
746,PART I.,"Her fearful sobs, self-folding like a flower"
747,PART I.,That faints into itself at evening hour:
748,PART I.,"But the God fostering her chilled hand,                     140"
749,PART I.,"She felt the warmth, her eyelids open'd bland,"
750,PART I.,"And, like new flowers at morning song of bees,"
751,PART I.,"Bloom'd, and gave up her honey to the lees."
752,PART I.,Into the green-recessed woods they flew;
753,PART I.,"Nor grew they pale, as mortal lovers do."
754,PART I.,
755,PART I.,"Left to herself, the serpent now began"
756,PART I.,"To change; her elfin blood in madness ran,"
757,PART I.,"Her mouth foam'd, and the grass, therewith besprent,"
758,PART I.,Wither'd at dew so sweet and virulent;
759,PART I.,"Her eyes in torture fix'd, and anguish drear,               150"
760,PART I.,"Hot, glaz'd, and wide, with lid-lashes all sear,"
761,PART I.,"Flash'd phosphor and sharp sparks, without one cooling tear."
762,PART I.,"The colours all inflam'd throughout her train,"
763,PART I.,"She writh'd about, convuls'd with scarlet pain:"
764,PART I.,A deep volcanian yellow took the place
765,PART I.,Of all her milder-mooned body's grace;
766,PART I.,"And, as the lava ravishes the mead,"
767,PART I.,"Spoilt all her silver mail, and golden brede;"
768,PART I.,"Made gloom of all her frecklings, streaks and bars,"
769,PART I.,"Eclips'd her crescents, and lick'd up her stars:            160"
770,PART I.,"So that, in moments few, she was undrest"
771,PART I.,"Of all her sapphires, greens, and amethyst,"
772,PART I.,"And rubious-argent: of all these bereft,"
773,PART I.,Nothing but pain and ugliness were left.
774,PART I.,"Still shone her crown; that vanish'd, also she"
775,PART I.,Melted and disappear'd as suddenly;
776,PART I.,"And in the air, her new voice luting soft,"
777,PART I.,"Cried, ""Lycius! gentle Lycius!""--Borne aloft"
778,PART I.,With the bright mists about the mountains hoar
779,PART I.,These words dissolv'd: Crete's forests heard no more.       170
780,PART I.,
781,PART I.,"Whither fled Lamia, now a lady bright,"
782,PART I.,A full-born beauty new and exquisite?
783,PART I.,She fled into that valley they pass o'er
784,PART I.,Who go to Corinth from Cenchreas' shore;
785,PART I.,"And rested at the foot of those wild hills,"
786,PART I.,"The rugged founts of the Peræan rills,"
787,PART I.,And of that other ridge whose barren back
788,PART I.,"Stretches, with all its mist and cloudy rack,"
789,PART I.,South-westward to Cleone. There she stood
790,PART I.,"About a young bird's flutter from a wood,                   180"
791,PART I.,"Fair, on a sloping green of mossy tread,"
792,PART I.,"By a clear pool, wherein she passioned"
793,PART I.,"To see herself escap'd from so sore ills,"
794,PART I.,While her robes flaunted with the daffodils.
795,PART I.,
796,PART I.,"Ah, happy Lycius!--for she was a maid"
797,PART I.,"More beautiful than ever twisted braid,"
798,PART I.,"Or sigh'd, or blush'd, or on spring-flowered lea"
799,PART I.,Spread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy:
800,PART I.,"A virgin purest lipp'd, yet in the lore"
801,PART I.,Of love deep learned to the red heart's core:               190
802,PART I.,"Not one hour old, yet of sciential brain"
803,PART I.,To unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain;
804,PART I.,"Define their pettish limits, and estrange"
805,PART I.,"Their points of contact, and swift counterchange;"
806,PART I.,"Intrigue with the specious chaos, and dispart"
807,PART I.,Its most ambiguous atoms with sure art;
808,PART I.,As though in Cupid's college she had spent
809,PART I.,"Sweet days a lovely graduate, still unshent,"
810,PART I.,And kept his rosy terms in idle languishment.
811,PART I.,
812,PART I.,Why this fair creature chose so fairily                   200
813,PART I.,"By the wayside to linger, we shall see;"
814,PART I.,But first 'tis fit to tell how she could muse
815,PART I.,"And dream, when in the serpent prison-house,"
816,PART I.,"Of all she list, strange or magnificent:"
817,PART I.,"How, ever, where she will'd, her spirit went;"
818,PART I.,"Whether to faint Elysium, or where"
819,PART I.,Down through tress-lifting waves the Nereids fair
820,PART I.,Wind into Thetis' bower by many a pearly stair;
821,PART I.,"Or where God Bacchus drains his cups divine,"
822,PART I.,"Stretch'd out, at ease, beneath a glutinous pine;           210"
823,PART I.,Or where in Pluto's gardens palatine
824,PART I.,Mulciber's columns gleam in far piazzian line.
825,PART I.,And sometimes into cities she would send
826,PART I.,"Her dream, with feast and rioting to blend;"
827,PART I.,"And once, while among mortals dreaming thus,"
828,PART I.,She saw the young Corinthian Lycius
829,PART I.,"Charioting foremost in the envious race,"
830,PART I.,"Like a young Jove with calm uneager face,"
831,PART I.,And fell into a swooning love of him.
832,PART I.,Now on the moth-time of that evening dim                    220
833,PART I.,"He would return that way, as well she knew,"
834,PART I.,To Corinth from the shore; for freshly blew
835,PART I.,"The eastern soft wind, and his galley now"
836,PART I.,Grated the quaystones with her brazen prow
837,PART I.,"In port Cenchreas, from Egina isle"
838,PART I.,Fresh anchor'd; whither he had been awhile
839,PART I.,"To sacrifice to Jove, whose temple there"
840,PART I.,Waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare.
841,PART I.,"Jove heard his vows, and better'd his desire;"
842,PART I.,For by some freakful chance he made retire                  230
843,PART I.,"From his companions, and set forth to walk,"
844,PART I.,Perhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk:
845,PART I.,"Over the solitary hills he fared,"
846,PART I.,"Thoughtless at first, but ere eve's star appeared"
847,PART I.,"His phantasy was lost, where reason fades,"
848,PART I.,In the calm'd twilight of Platonic shades.
849,PART I.,"Lamia beheld him coming, near, more near--"
850,PART I.,"Close to her passing, in indifference drear,"
851,PART I.,His silent sandals swept the mossy green;
852,PART I.,"So neighbour'd to him, and yet so unseen                    240"
853,PART I.,"She stood: he pass'd, shut up in mysteries,"
854,PART I.,"His mind wrapp'd like his mantle, while her eyes"
855,PART I.,"Follow'd his steps, and her neck regal white"
856,PART I.,"Turn'd--syllabling thus, ""Ah, Lycius bright,"
857,PART I.,And will you leave me on the hills alone?
858,PART I.,"Lycius, look back! and be some pity shown."""
859,PART I.,"He did; not with cold wonder fearingly,"
860,PART I.,But Orpheus-like at an Eurydice;
861,PART I.,"For so delicious were the words she sung,"
862,PART I.,It seem'd he had lov'd them a whole summer long:            250
863,PART I.,"And soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up,"
864,PART I.,"Leaving no drop in the bewildering cup,"
865,PART I.,"And still the cup was full,--while he, afraid"
866,PART I.,Lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid
867,PART I.,"Due adoration, thus began to adore;"
868,PART I.,"Her soft look growing coy, she saw his chain so sure:"
869,PART I.,"""Leave thee alone! Look back! Ah, Goddess, see"
870,PART I.,Whether my eyes can ever turn from thee!
871,PART I.,For pity do not this sad heart belie--
872,PART I.,Even as thou vanishest so I shall die.                      260
873,PART I.,"Stay! though a Naiad of the rivers, stay!"
874,PART I.,To thy far wishes will thy streams obey:
875,PART I.,"Stay! though the greenest woods be thy domain,"
876,PART I.,Alone they can drink up the morning rain:
877,PART I.,"Though a descended Pleiad, will not one"
878,PART I.,Of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune
879,PART I.,"Thy spheres, and as thy silver proxy shine?"
880,PART I.,So sweetly to these ravish'd ears of mine
881,PART I.,"Came thy sweet greeting, that if thou shouldst fade"
882,PART I.,Thy memory will waste me to a shade:--                      270
883,PART I.,"For pity do not melt!""--""If I should stay,"""
884,PART I.,"Said Lamia, ""here, upon this floor of clay,"
885,PART I.,"And pain my steps upon these flowers too rough,"
886,PART I.,What canst thou say or do of charm enough
887,PART I.,To dull the nice remembrance of my home?
888,PART I.,Thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam
889,PART I.,"Over these hills and vales, where no joy is,--"
890,PART I.,Empty of immortality and bliss!
891,PART I.,"Thou art a scholar, Lycius, and must know"
892,PART I.,That finer spirits cannot breathe below                     280
893,PART I.,"In human climes, and live: Alas! poor youth,"
894,PART I.,What taste of purer air hast thou to soothe
895,PART I.,"My essence? What serener palaces,"
896,PART I.,"Where I may all my many senses please,"
897,PART I.,And by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease?
898,PART I.,"It cannot be--Adieu!"" So said, she rose"
899,PART I.,"Tiptoe with white arms spread. He, sick to lose"
900,PART I.,"The amorous promise of her lone complain,"
901,PART I.,"Swoon'd, murmuring of love, and pale with pain."
902,PART I.,"The cruel lady, without any show                            290"
903,PART I.,"Of sorrow for her tender favourite's woe,"
904,PART I.,"But rather, if her eyes could brighter be,"
905,PART I.,"With brighter eyes and slow amenity,"
906,PART I.,"Put her new lips to his, and gave afresh"
907,PART I.,The life she had so tangled in her mesh:
908,PART I.,And as he from one trance was wakening
909,PART I.,"Into another, she began to sing,"
910,PART I.,"Happy in beauty, life, and love, and every thing,"
911,PART I.,"A song of love, too sweet for earthly lyres,"
912,PART I.,"While, like held breath, the stars drew in their panting"
913,PART I.,fires.                                                  300
914,PART I.,"And then she whisper'd in such trembling tone,"
915,PART I.,"As those who, safe together met alone"
916,PART I.,"For the first time through many anguish'd days,"
917,PART I.,Use other speech than looks; bidding him raise
918,PART I.,"His drooping head, and clear his soul of doubt,"
919,PART I.,"For that she was a woman, and without"
920,PART I.,Any more subtle fluid in her veins
921,PART I.,"Than throbbing blood, and that the self-same pains"
922,PART I.,Inhabited her frail-strung heart as his.
923,PART I.,And next she wonder'd how his eyes could miss               310
924,PART I.,"Her face so long in Corinth, where, she said,"
925,PART I.,"She dwelt but half retir'd, and there had led"
926,PART I.,Days happy as the gold coin could invent
927,PART I.,Without the aid of love; yet in content
928,PART I.,"Till she saw him, as once she pass'd him by,"
929,PART I.,Where 'gainst a column he leant thoughtfully
930,PART I.,"At Venus' temple porch, 'mid baskets heap'd"
931,PART I.,"Of amorous herbs and flowers, newly reap'd"
932,PART I.,"Late on that eve, as 'twas the night before"
933,PART I.,"The Adonian feast; whereof she saw no more,                 320"
934,PART I.,"But wept alone those days, for why should she adore?"
935,PART I.,"Lycius from death awoke into amaze,"
936,PART I.,"To see her still, and singing so sweet lays;"
937,PART I.,Then from amaze into delight he fell
938,PART I.,To hear her whisper woman's lore so well;
939,PART I.,And every word she spake entic'd him on
940,PART I.,To unperplex'd delight and pleasure known.
941,PART I.,Let the mad poets say whate'er they please
942,PART I.,"Of the sweets of Fairies, Peris, Goddesses,"
943,PART I.,"There is not such a treat among them all,                   330"
944,PART I.,"Haunters of cavern, lake, and waterfall,"
945,PART I.,"As a real woman, lineal indeed"
946,PART I.,From Pyrrha's pebbles or old Adam's seed.
947,PART I.,"Thus gentle Lamia judg'd, and judg'd aright,"
948,PART I.,"That Lycius could not love in half a fright,"
949,PART I.,"So threw the goddess off, and won his heart"
950,PART I.,"More pleasantly by playing woman's part,"
951,PART I.,"With no more awe than what her beauty gave,"
952,PART I.,"That, while it smote, still guaranteed to save."
953,PART I.,"Lycius to all made eloquent reply,                          340"
954,PART I.,Marrying to every word a twinborn sigh;
955,PART I.,"And last, pointing to Corinth, ask'd her sweet,"
956,PART I.,If 'twas too far that night for her soft feet.
957,PART I.,"The way was short, for Lamia's eagerness"
958,PART I.,"Made, by a spell, the triple league decrease"
959,PART I.,To a few paces; not at all surmised
960,PART I.,"By blinded Lycius, so in her comprized."
961,PART I.,"They pass'd the city gates, he knew not how,"
962,PART I.,"So noiseless, and he never thought to know."
963,PART I.,
964,PART I.,"As men talk in a dream, so Corinth all,                   350"
965,PART I.,"Throughout her palaces imperial,"
966,PART I.,"And all her populous streets and temples lewd,"
967,PART I.,"Mutter'd, like tempest in the distance brew'd,"
968,PART I.,To the wide-spreaded night above her towers.
969,PART I.,"Men, women, rich and poor, in the cool hours,"
970,PART I.,"Shuffled their sandals o'er the pavement white,"
971,PART I.,Companion'd or alone; while many a light
972,PART I.,"Flared, here and there, from wealthy festivals,"
973,PART I.,"And threw their moving shadows on the walls,"
974,PART I.,Or found them cluster'd in the corniced shade               360
975,PART I.,"Of some arch'd temple door, or dusky colonnade."
976,PART I.,
977,PART I.,"Muffling his face, of greeting friends in fear,"
978,PART I.,"Her fingers he press'd hard, as one came near"
979,PART I.,"With curl'd gray beard, sharp eyes, and smooth bald crown,"
980,PART I.,"Slow-stepp'd, and robed in philosophic gown:"
981,PART I.,"Lycius shrank closer, as they met and past,"
982,PART I.,"Into his mantle, adding wings to haste,"
983,PART I.,"While hurried Lamia trembled: ""Ah,"" said he,"
984,PART I.,"""Why do you shudder, love, so ruefully?"
985,PART I.,"Why does your tender palm dissolve in dew?""--               370"
986,PART I.,"""I'm wearied,"" said fair Lamia: ""tell me who"
987,PART I.,Is that old man? I cannot bring to mind
988,PART I.,His features:--Lycius! wherefore did you blind
989,PART I.,"Yourself from his quick eyes?"" Lycius replied,"
990,PART I.,"""'Tis Apollonius sage, my trusty guide"
991,PART I.,And good instructor; but to-night he seems
992,PART I.,"The ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams."""
993,PART I.,
994,PART I.,While yet he spake they had arrived before
995,PART I.,"A pillar'd porch, with lofty portal door,"
996,PART I.,"Where hung a silver lamp, whose phosphor glow               380"
997,PART I.,"Reflected in the slabbed steps below,"
998,PART I.,"Mild as a star in water; for so new,"
999,PART I.,"And so unsullied was the marble hue,"
1000,PART I.,"So through the crystal polish, liquid fine,"
1001,PART I.,"Ran the dark veins, that none but feet divine"
1002,PART I.,Could e'er have touch'd there. Sounds Æolian
1003,PART I.,"Breath'd from the hinges, as the ample span"
1004,PART I.,Of the wide doors disclos'd a place unknown
1005,PART I.,"Some time to any, but those two alone,"
1006,PART I.,"And a few Persian mutes, who that same year                 390"
1007,PART I.,Were seen about the markets: none knew where
1008,PART I.,They could inhabit; the most curious
1009,PART I.,"Were foil'd, who watch'd to trace them to their house:"
1010,PART I.,"And but the flitter-winged verse must tell,"
1011,PART I.,"For truth's sake, what woe afterwards befel,"
1012,PART I.,"'Twould humour many a heart to leave them thus,"
1013,PART I.,Shut from the busy world of more incredulous.
1014,PART I.,
1015,PART I.,
1016,PART II.,PART II.
1017,PART II.,
1018,PART II.,"Love in a hut, with water and a crust,"
1019,PART II.,"Is--Love, forgive us!--cinders, ashes, dust;"
1020,PART II.,Love in a palace is perhaps at last
1021,PART II.,More grievous torment than a hermit's fast:--
1022,PART II.,"That is a doubtful tale from faery land,"
1023,PART II.,Hard for the non-elect to understand.
1024,PART II.,"Had Lycius liv'd to hand his story down,"
1025,PART II.,"He might have given the moral a fresh frown,"
1026,PART II.,Or clench'd it quite: but too short was their bliss
1027,PART II.,"To breed distrust and hate, that make the soft voice hiss.   10"
1028,PART II.,"Besides, there, nightly, with terrific glare"
1029,PART II.,"Love, jealous grown of so complete a pair,"
1030,PART II.,"Hover'd and buzz'd his wings, with fearful roar,"
1031,PART II.,"Above the lintel of their chamber door,"
1032,PART II.,And down the passage cast a glow upon the floor.
1033,PART II.,
1034,PART II.,For all this came a ruin: side by side
1035,PART II.,"They were enthroned, in the even tide,"
1036,PART II.,"Upon a couch, near to a curtaining"
1037,PART II.,"Whose airy texture, from a golden string,"
1038,PART II.,"Floated into the room, and let appear                        20"
1039,PART II.,"Unveil'd the summer heaven, blue and clear,"
1040,PART II.,"Betwixt two marble shafts:--there they reposed,"
1041,PART II.,"Where use had made it sweet, with eyelids closed,"
1042,PART II.,"Saving a tythe which love still open kept,"
1043,PART II.,That they might see each other while they almost slept;
1044,PART II.,"When from the slope side of a suburb hill,"
1045,PART II.,"Deafening the swallow's twitter, came a thrill"
1046,PART II.,"Of trumpets--Lycius started--the sounds fled,"
1047,PART II.,"But left a thought, a buzzing in his head."
1048,PART II.,"For the first time, since first he harbour'd in              30"
1049,PART II.,"That purple-lined palace of sweet sin,"
1050,PART II.,His spirit pass'd beyond its golden bourn
1051,PART II.,Into the noisy world almost forsworn.
1052,PART II.,"The lady, ever watchful, penetrant,"
1053,PART II.,"Saw this with pain, so arguing a want"
1054,PART II.,"Of something more, more than her empery"
1055,PART II.,Of joys; and she began to moan and sigh
1056,PART II.,"Because he mused beyond her, knowing well"
1057,PART II.,That but a moment's thought is passion's passing bell.
1058,PART II.,"""Why do you sigh, fair creature?"" whisper'd he:              40"
1059,PART II.,"""Why do you think?"" return'd she tenderly:"
1060,PART II.,"""You have deserted me;--where am I now?"
1061,PART II.,Not in your heart while care weighs on your brow:
1062,PART II.,"No, no, you have dismiss'd me; and I go"
1063,PART II.,"From your breast houseless: ay, it must be so."""
1064,PART II.,"He answer'd, bending to her open eyes,"
1065,PART II.,"Where he was mirror'd small in paradise,"
1066,PART II.,"""My silver planet, both of eve and morn!"
1067,PART II.,"Why will you plead yourself so sad forlorn,"
1068,PART II.,While I am striving how to fill my heart                     50
1069,PART II.,"With deeper crimson, and a double smart?"
1070,PART II.,"How to entangle, trammel up and snare"
1071,PART II.,"Your soul in mine, and labyrinth you there"
1072,PART II.,Like the hid scent in an unbudded rose?
1073,PART II.,"Ay, a sweet kiss--you see your mighty woes."
1074,PART II.,My thoughts! shall I unveil them? Listen then!
1075,PART II.,"What mortal hath a prize, that other men"
1076,PART II.,"May be confounded and abash'd withal,"
1077,PART II.,"But lets it sometimes pace abroad majestical,"
1078,PART II.,"And triumph, as in thee I should rejoice                     60"
1079,PART II.,Amid the hoarse alarm of Corinth's voice.
1080,PART II.,"Let my foes choke, and my friends shout afar,"
1081,PART II.,While through the thronged streets your bridal car
1082,PART II.,"Wheels round its dazzling spokes.""--The lady's cheek"
1083,PART II.,"Trembled; she nothing said, but, pale and meek,"
1084,PART II.,"Arose and knelt before him, wept a rain"
1085,PART II.,Of sorrows at his words; at last with pain
1086,PART II.,"Beseeching him, the while his hand she wrung,"
1087,PART II.,"To change his purpose. He thereat was stung,"
1088,PART II.,"Perverse, with stronger fancy to reclaim                     70"
1089,PART II.,Her wild and timid nature to his aim:
1090,PART II.,"Besides, for all his love, in self despite,"
1091,PART II.,"Against his better self, he took delight"
1092,PART II.,"Luxurious in her sorrows, soft and new."
1093,PART II.,"His passion, cruel grown, took on a hue"
1094,PART II.,Fierce and sanguineous as 'twas possible
1095,PART II.,In one whose brow had no dark veins to swell.
1096,PART II.,"Fine was the mitigated fury, like"
1097,PART II.,Apollo's presence when in act to strike
1098,PART II.,"The serpent--Ha, the serpent! certes, she                    80"
1099,PART II.,"Was none. She burnt, she lov'd the tyranny,"
1100,PART II.,"And, all subdued, consented to the hour"
1101,PART II.,When to the bridal he should lead his paramour.
1102,PART II.,"Whispering in midnight silence, said the youth,"
1103,PART II.,"""Sure some sweet name thou hast, though, by my truth,"
1104,PART II.,"I have not ask'd it, ever thinking thee"
1105,PART II.,"Not mortal, but of heavenly progeny,"
1106,PART II.,"As still I do. Hast any mortal name,"
1107,PART II.,Fit appellation for this dazzling frame?
1108,PART II.,"Or friends or kinsfolk on the citied earth,                  90"
1109,PART II.,"To share our marriage feast and nuptial mirth?"""
1110,PART II.,"""I have no friends,"" said Lamia, ""no, not one;"
1111,PART II.,My presence in wide Corinth hardly known:
1112,PART II.,My parents' bones are in their dusty urns
1113,PART II.,"Sepulchred, where no kindled incense burns,"
1114,PART II.,"Seeing all their luckless race are dead, save me,"
1115,PART II.,And I neglect the holy rite for thee.
1116,PART II.,Even as you list invite your many guests;
1117,PART II.,"But if, as now it seems, your vision rests"
1118,PART II.,"With any pleasure on me, do not bid                         100"
1119,PART II.,"Old Apollonius--from him keep me hid."""
1120,PART II.,"Lycius, perplex'd at words so blind and blank,"
1121,PART II.,"Made close inquiry; from whose touch she shrank,"
1122,PART II.,Feigning a sleep; and he to the dull shade
1123,PART II.,Of deep sleep in a moment was betray'd.
1124,PART II.,
1125,PART II.,It was the custom then to bring away
1126,PART II.,"The bride from home at blushing shut of day,"
1127,PART II.,"Veil'd, in a chariot, heralded along"
1128,PART II.,"By strewn flowers, torches, and a marriage song,"
1129,PART II.,With other pageants: but this fair unknown                  110
1130,PART II.,"Had not a friend. So being left alone,"
1131,PART II.,(Lycius was gone to summon all his kin)
1132,PART II.,And knowing surely she could never win
1133,PART II.,"His foolish heart from its mad pompousness,"
1134,PART II.,"She set herself, high-thoughted, how to dress"
1135,PART II.,The misery in fit magnificence.
1136,PART II.,"She did so, but 'tis doubtful how and whence"
1137,PART II.,"Came, and who were her subtle servitors."
1138,PART II.,"About the halls, and to and from the doors,"
1139,PART II.,"There was a noise of wings, till in short space             120"
1140,PART II.,The glowing banquet-room shone with wide-arched grace.
1141,PART II.,"A haunting music, sole perhaps and lone"
1142,PART II.,"Supportress of the faery-roof, made moan"
1143,PART II.,"Throughout, as fearful the whole charm might fade."
1144,PART II.,"Fresh carved cedar, mimicking a glade"
1145,PART II.,"Of palm and plantain, met from either side,"
1146,PART II.,"High in the midst, in honour of the bride:"
1147,PART II.,"Two palms and then two plantains, and so on,"
1148,PART II.,From either side their stems branch'd one to one
1149,PART II.,All down the aisled place; and beneath all                  130
1150,PART II.,There ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to wall.
1151,PART II.,"So canopied, lay an untasted feast"
1152,PART II.,"Teeming with odours. Lamia, regal drest,"
1153,PART II.,"Silently paced about, and as she went,"
1154,PART II.,"In pale contented sort of discontent,"
1155,PART II.,Mission'd her viewless servants to enrich
1156,PART II.,The fretted splendour of each nook and niche.
1157,PART II.,"Between the tree-stems, marbled plain at first,"
1158,PART II.,"Came jasper pannels; then, anon, there burst"
1159,PART II.,"Forth creeping imagery of slighter trees,                   140"
1160,PART II.,And with the larger wove in small intricacies.
1161,PART II.,"Approving all, she faded at self-will,"
1162,PART II.,"And shut the chamber up, close, hush'd and still,"
1163,PART II.,"Complete and ready for the revels rude,"
1164,PART II.,When dreadful guests would come to spoil her solitude.
1165,PART II.,
1166,PART II.,"The day appear'd, and all the gossip rout."
1167,PART II.,O senseless Lycius! Madman! wherefore flout
1168,PART II.,"The silent-blessing fate, warm cloister'd hours,"
1169,PART II.,And show to common eyes these secret bowers?
1170,PART II.,"The herd approach'd; each guest, with busy brain,           150"
1171,PART II.,"Arriving at the portal, gaz'd amain,"
1172,PART II.,"And enter'd marveling: for they knew the street,"
1173,PART II.,Remember'd it from childhood all complete
1174,PART II.,"Without a gap, yet ne'er before had seen"
1175,PART II.,"That royal porch, that high-built fair demesne;"
1176,PART II.,"So in they hurried all, maz'd, curious and keen:"
1177,PART II.,"Save one, who look'd thereon with eye severe,"
1178,PART II.,And with calm-planted steps walk'd in austere;
1179,PART II.,"'Twas Apollonius: something too he laugh'd,"
1180,PART II.,"As though some knotty problem, that had daft                160"
1181,PART II.,"His patient thought, had now begun to thaw,"
1182,PART II.,And solve and melt:--'twas just as he foresaw.
1183,PART II.,
1184,PART II.,He met within the murmurous vestibule
1185,PART II.,"His young disciple. ""'Tis no common rule,"
1186,PART II.,"Lycius,"" said he, ""for uninvited guest"
1187,PART II.,"To force himself upon you, and infest"
1188,PART II.,With an unbidden presence the bright throng
1189,PART II.,"Of younger friends; yet must I do this wrong,"
1190,PART II.,"And you forgive me."" Lycius blush'd, and led"
1191,PART II.,The old man through the inner doors broad-spread;           170
1192,PART II.,With reconciling words and courteous mien
1193,PART II.,Turning into sweet milk the sophist's spleen.
1194,PART II.,
1195,PART II.,"Of wealthy lustre was the banquet-room,"
1196,PART II.,Fill'd with pervading brilliance and perfume:
1197,PART II.,Before each lucid pannel fuming stood
1198,PART II.,"A censer fed with myrrh and spiced wood,"
1199,PART II.,"Each by a sacred tripod held aloft,"
1200,PART II.,Whose slender feet wide-swerv'd upon the soft
1201,PART II.,Wool-woofed carpets: fifty wreaths of smoke
1202,PART II.,From fifty censers their light voyage took                  180
1203,PART II.,"To the high roof, still mimick'd as they rose"
1204,PART II.,Along the mirror'd walls by twin-clouds odorous.
1205,PART II.,"Twelve sphered tables, by silk seats insphered,"
1206,PART II.,High as the level of a man's breast rear'd
1207,PART II.,"On libbard's paws, upheld the heavy gold"
1208,PART II.,"Of cups and goblets, and the store thrice told"
1209,PART II.,"Of Ceres' horn, and, in huge vessels, wine"
1210,PART II.,Come from the gloomy tun with merry shine.
1211,PART II.,"Thus loaded with a feast the tables stood,"
1212,PART II.,Each shrining in the midst the image of a God.              190
1213,PART II.,
1214,PART II.,When in an antichamber every guest
1215,PART II.,"Had felt the cold full sponge to pleasure press'd,"
1216,PART II.,"By minist'ring slaves, upon his hands and feet,"
1217,PART II.,And fragrant oils with ceremony meet
1218,PART II.,"Pour'd on his hair, they all mov'd to the feast"
1219,PART II.,"In white robes, and themselves in order placed"
1220,PART II.,"Around the silken couches, wondering"
1221,PART II.,Whence all this mighty cost and blaze of wealth could spring.
1222,PART II.,
1223,PART II.,"Soft went the music the soft air along,"
1224,PART II.,While fluent Greek a vowel'd undersong                      200
1225,PART II.,"Kept up among the guests, discoursing low"
1226,PART II.,"At first, for scarcely was the wine at flow;"
1227,PART II.,"But when the happy vintage touch'd their brains,"
1228,PART II.,"Louder they talk, and louder come the strains"
1229,PART II.,"Of powerful instruments:--the gorgeous dyes,"
1230,PART II.,"The space, the splendour of the draperies,"
1231,PART II.,"The roof of awful richness, nectarous cheer,"
1232,PART II.,"Beautiful slaves, and Lamia's self, appear,"
1233,PART II.,"Now, when the wine has done its rosy deed,"
1234,PART II.,"And every soul from human trammels freed,                   210"
1235,PART II.,"No more so strange; for merry wine, sweet wine,"
1236,PART II.,"Will make Elysian shades not too fair, too divine."
1237,PART II.,Soon was God Bacchus at meridian height;

1239,PART II.,"Garlands of every green, and every scent"
1240,PART II.,"From vales deflower'd, or forest-trees branch-rent,"
1241,PART II.,In baskets of bright osier'd gold were brought
1242,PART II.,"High as the handles heap'd, to suit the thought"

1245,PART II.,
1246,PART II.,What wreath for Lamia? What for Lycius?
1247,PART II.,"What for the sage, old Apollonius?"
1248,PART II.,Upon her aching forehead be there hung
1249,PART II.,The leaves of willow and of adder's tongue;
1250,PART II.,"And for the youth, quick, let us strip for him"
1251,PART II.,"The thyrsus, that his watching eyes may swim"
1252,PART II.,"Into forgetfulness; and, for the sage,"
1253,PART II.,Let spear-grass and the spiteful thistle wage

1255,PART II.,At the mere touch of cold philosophy?                       230
1256,PART II.,There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:
1257,PART II.,"We know her woof, her texture; she is given"
1258,PART II.,In the dull catalogue of common things.
1259,PART II.,"Philosophy will clip an Angel's wings,"

1264,PART II.,
1265,PART II.,"By her glad Lycius sitting, in chief place,"
1266,PART II.,"Scarce saw in all the room another face,                    240"
1267,PART II.,"Till, checking his love trance, a cup he took"
1268,PART II.,"Full brimm'd, and opposite sent forth a look"
1269,PART II.,"'Cross the broad table, to beseech a glance"
1270,PART II.,"From his old teacher's wrinkled countenance,"
1271,PART II.,And pledge him. The bald-head philosopher
1272,PART II.,"Had fix'd his eye, without a twinkle or stir"
1273,PART II.,"Full on the alarmed beauty of the bride,"
1274,PART II.,"Brow-beating her fair form, and troubling her sweet pride."
1275,PART II.,"Lycius then press'd her hand, with devout touch,"
1276,PART II.,As pale it lay upon the rosy couch:                         250
1277,PART II.,"'Twas icy, and the cold ran through his veins;"
1278,PART II.,"Then sudden it grew hot, and all the pains"
1279,PART II.,Of an unnatural heat shot to his heart.
1280,PART II.,"""Lamia, what means this? Wherefore dost thou start?"
1281,PART II.,"Know'st thou that man?"" Poor Lamia answer'd not."
1282,PART II.,"He gaz'd into her eyes, and not a jot"
1283,PART II.,Own'd they the lovelorn piteous appeal:
1284,PART II.,"More, more he gaz'd: his human senses reel:"
1285,PART II.,Some hungry spell that loveliness absorbs;
1286,PART II.,There was no recognition in those orbs.                     260
1287,PART II.,"""Lamia!"" he cried--and no soft-toned reply."
1288,PART II.,"The many heard, and the loud revelry"
1289,PART II.,Grew hush; the stately music no more breathes;
1290,PART II.,The myrtle sicken'd in a thousand wreaths.
1291,PART II.,"By faint degrees, voice, lute, and pleasure ceased;"
1292,PART II.,"A deadly silence step by step increased,"
1293,PART II.,"Until it seem'd a horrid presence there,"
1294,PART II.,And not a man but felt the terror in his hair.
1295,PART II.,"""Lamia!"" he shriek'd; and nothing but the shriek"
1296,PART II.,With its sad echo did the silence break.                    270
1297,PART II.,"""Begone, foul dream!"" he cried, gazing again"
1298,PART II.,"In the bride's face, where now no azure vein"
1299,PART II.,Wander'd on fair-spaced temples; no soft bloom
1300,PART II.,Misted the cheek; no passion to illume
1301,PART II.,The deep-recessed vision:--all was blight;
1302,PART II.,"Lamia, no longer fair, there sat a deadly white."
1303,PART II.,"""Shut, shut those juggling eyes, thou ruthless man!"
1304,PART II.,"Turn them aside, wretch! or the righteous ban"
1305,PART II.,"Of all the Gods, whose dreadful images"
1306,PART II.,"Here represent their shadowy presences,                     280"
1307,PART II.,May pierce them on the sudden with the thorn
1308,PART II.,"Of painful blindness; leaving thee forlorn,"
1309,PART II.,In trembling dotage to the feeblest fright
1310,PART II.,"Of conscience, for their long offended might,"
1311,PART II.,"For all thine impious proud-heart sophistries,"
1312,PART II.,"Unlawful magic, and enticing lies."
1313,PART II.,Corinthians! look upon that gray-beard wretch!
1314,PART II.,"Mark how, possess'd, his lashless eyelids stretch"
1315,PART II.,"Around his demon eyes! Corinthians, see!"
1316,PART II.,"My sweet bride withers at their potency.""                   290"
1317,PART II.,"""Fool!"" said the sophist, in an under-tone"
1318,PART II.,Gruff with contempt; which a death-nighing moan
1319,PART II.,"From Lycius answer'd, as heart-struck and lost,"
1320,PART II.,He sank supine beside the aching ghost.
1321,PART II.,"""Fool! Fool!"" repeated he, while his eyes still"
1322,PART II.,"Relented not, nor mov'd; ""from every ill"
1323,PART II.,"Of life have I preserv'd thee to this day,"
1324,PART II.,"And shall I see thee made a serpent's prey?"""
1325,PART II.,"Then Lamia breath'd death breath; the sophist's eye,"
1326,PART II.,"Like a sharp spear, went through her utterly,               300"
1327,PART II.,"Keen, cruel, perceant, stinging: she, as well"
1328,PART II.,"As her weak hand could any meaning tell,"
1329,PART II.,"Motion'd him to be silent; vainly so,"
1330,PART II.,He look'd and look'd again a level--No!
1331,PART II.,"""A Serpent!"" echoed he; no sooner said,"
1332,PART II.,Than with a frightful scream she vanished:
1333,PART II.,"And Lycius' arms were empty of delight,"
1334,PART II.,"As were his limbs of life, from that same night."
1335,PART II.,On the high couch he lay!--his friends came round--
1336,PART II.,"Supported him--no pulse, or breath they found,              310"

1383,I.,They could not in the self-same mansion dwell
1384,I.,"Without some stir of heart, some malady;"
1385,I.,They could not sit at meals but feel how well

1395,II.,But her full shape would all his seeing fill;
1396,II.,And his continual voice was pleasanter
1397,II.,"To her, than noise of trees or hidden rill;"
1398,II.,"Her lute-string gave an echo of his name,"
1399,II.,She spoilt her half-done broidery with the same.
1400,II.,
1401,III.,III.
1402,III.,
1403,III.,"He knew whose gentle hand was at the latch,"
1404,III.,Before the door had given her to his eyes;

1406,III.,Her beauty farther than the falcon spies;                  20
1407,III.,"And constant as her vespers would he watch,"
1408,III.,Because her face was turn'd to the same skies;

1638,XXIV.,"Lorenzo, courteously as he was wont,"

1642,XXIV.,
1643,XXV.,XXV.
1644,XXV.,
1645,XXV.,"And as he to the court-yard pass'd along,"
1646,XXV.,"Each third step did he pause, and listen'd oft"
1647,XXV.,"If he could hear his lady's matin-song,"
1648,XXV.,Or the light whisper of her footstep soft;
1649,XXV.,"And as he thus over his passion hung,"
1650,XXV.,He heard a laugh full musical aloft;
1651,XXV.,"When, looking up, he saw her features bright"

1664,XXVI.,
1665,XXVII.,XXVII.
1666,XXVII.,
1667,XXVII.,So the two brothers and their murder'd man
1668,XXVII.,"Rode past fair Florence, to where Arno's stream           210"
1669,XXVII.,"Gurgles through straiten'd banks, and still doth fan"
1670,XXVII.,"Itself with dancing bulrush, and the bream"
1671,XXVII.,Keeps head against the freshets. Sick and wan
1672,XXVII.,"The brothers' faces in the ford did seem,"
1673,XXVII.,Lorenzo's flush with love.--They pass'd the water
1674,XXVII.,Into a forest quiet for the slaughter.
1675,XXVII.,
1676,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
1677,XXVIII.,
1678,XXVIII.,"There was Lorenzo slain and buried in,"
1679,XXVIII.,There in that forest did his great love cease;
1680,XXVIII.,"Ah! when a soul doth thus its freedom win,"
1681,XXVIII.,It aches in loneliness--is ill at peace                   220
1682,XXVIII.,As the break-covert blood-hounds of such sin:
1683,XXVIII.,"They dipp'd their swords in the water, and did tease"
1684,XXVIII.,"Their horses homeward, with convulsed spur,"
1685,XXVIII.,Each richer by his being a murderer.
1686,XXVIII.,
1687,XXIX.,XXIX.
1688,XXIX.,
1689,XXIX.,"They told their sister how, with sudden speed,"

1703,XXX.,She brooded o'er the luxury alone:
1704,XXX.,"His image in the dusk she seem'd to see,"

1706,XXX.,"Spreading her perfect arms upon the air,"

1714,XXXI.,Upon the time with feverish unrest--
1715,XXXI.,Not long--for soon into her heart a throng
1716,XXXI.,"Of higher occupants, a richer zest,"
1717,XXXI.,"Came tragic; passion not to be subdued,"
1718,XXXI.,And sorrow for her love in travels rude.

1724,XXXII.,And the sick west continually bereaves
1725,XXXII.,"Of some gold tinge, and plays a roundelay"
1726,XXXII.,"Of death among the bushes and the leaves,"
1727,XXXII.,To make all bare before he dares to stray

1735,XXXIII.,"Striving to be itself, what dungeon climes"
1736,XXXIII.,Could keep him off so long? They spake a tale             260

1738,XXXIII.,"Came on them, like a smoke from Hinnom's vale;"
1739,XXXIII.,"And every night in dreams they groan'd aloud,"

1742,XXXIV.,XXXIV.
1743,XXXIV.,
1744,XXXIV.,"And she had died in drowsy ignorance,"
1745,XXXIV.,But for a thing more deadly dark than all;
1746,XXXIV.,"It came like a fierce potion, drunk by chance,"
1747,XXXIV.,Which saves a sick man from the feather'd pall
1748,XXXIV.,"For some few gasping moments; like a lance,"
1749,XXXIV.,Waking an Indian from his cloudy hall                     270
1750,XXXIV.,"With cruel pierce, and bringing him again"

1759,XXXV.,"Lustre into the sun, and put cold doom"
1760,XXXV.,"Upon his lips, and taken the soft lute"
1761,XXXV.,"From his lorn voice, and past his loamed ears"

1769,XXXVI.,And Isabella on its music hung:
1770,XXXVI.,"Languor there was in it, and tremulous shake,"
1771,XXXVI.,As in a palsied Druid's harp unstrung;
1772,XXXVI.,"And through it moan'd a ghostly under-song,"

1776,XXXVII.,

1779,XXXVII.,"From the poor girl by magic of their light,"
1780,XXXVII.,The while it did unthread the horrid woof

1787,XXXVIII.,
1788,XXXVIII.,"Saying moreover, ""Isabel, my sweet!"
1789,XXXVIII.,"Red whortle-berries droop above my head,"

1791,XXXVIII.,Around me beeches and high chestnuts shed                 300

1847,XLIII.,"How her short absence might be unsurmised,"
1848,XLIII.,While she the inmost of the dream would try.

3215,BOOK I.,
3216,BOOK I.,Deep in the shady sadness of a vale
3217,BOOK I.,"Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,"
3218,BOOK I.,"Far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star,"
3219,BOOK I.,"Sat gray-hair'd Saturn, quiet as a stone,"
3220,BOOK I.,Still as the silence round about his lair;
3221,BOOK I.,Forest on forest hung about his head
3222,BOOK I.,"Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,"
3223,BOOK I.,Not so much life as on a summer's day
3224,BOOK I.,"Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass,"
3225,BOOK I.,"But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.             10"
3226,BOOK I.,"A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more"
3227,BOOK I.,By reason of his fallen divinity
3228,BOOK I.,Spreading a shade: the Naiad 'mid her reeds
3229,BOOK I.,Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips.
3230,BOOK I.,
3231,BOOK I.,"Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went,"
3232,BOOK I.,"No further than to where his feet had stray'd,"
3233,BOOK I.,And slept there since. Upon the sodden ground
3234,BOOK I.,"His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,"
3235,BOOK I.,Unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed;
3236,BOOK I.,"While his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the Earth,          20"
3237,BOOK I.,"His ancient mother, for some comfort yet."
3238,BOOK I.,
3239,BOOK I.,It seem'd no force could wake him from his place;
3240,BOOK I.,"But there came one, who with a kindred hand"
3241,BOOK I.,"Touch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low"
3242,BOOK I.,"With reverence, though to one who knew it not."
3243,BOOK I.,She was a Goddess of the infant world;
3244,BOOK I.,By her in stature the tall Amazon
3245,BOOK I.,Had stood a pigmy's height: she would have ta'en
3246,BOOK I.,Achilles by the hair and bent his neck;
3247,BOOK I.,Or with a finger stay'd Ixion's wheel.                       30
3248,BOOK I.,"Her face was large as that of Memphian sphinx,"
3249,BOOK I.,"Pedestal'd haply in a palace court,"
3250,BOOK I.,When sages look'd to Egypt for their lore.
3251,BOOK I.,But oh! how unlike marble was that face:
3252,BOOK I.,"How beautiful, if sorrow had not made"
3253,BOOK I.,Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty's self.
3254,BOOK I.,"There was a listening fear in her regard,"
3255,BOOK I.,As if calamity had but begun;
3256,BOOK I.,As if the vanward clouds of evil days
3257,BOOK I.,"Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear                  40"
3258,BOOK I.,Was with its stored thunder labouring up.
3259,BOOK I.,One hand she press'd upon that aching spot
3260,BOOK I.,"Where beats the human heart, as if just there,"
3261,BOOK I.,"Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain:"
3262,BOOK I.,The other upon Saturn's bended neck
3263,BOOK I.,"She laid, and to the level of his ear"
3264,BOOK I.,"Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake"
3265,BOOK I.,In solemn tenour and deep organ tone:
3266,BOOK I.,"Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue"
3267,BOOK I.,Would come in these like accents; O how frail                50
3268,BOOK I.,To that large utterance of the early Gods!
3269,BOOK I.,"""Saturn, look up!--though wherefore, poor old King?"
3270,BOOK I.,"I have no comfort for thee, no not one:"
3271,BOOK I.,"I cannot say, 'O wherefore sleepest thou?'"
3272,BOOK I.,"For heaven is parted from thee, and the earth"
3273,BOOK I.,"Knows thee not, thus afflicted, for a God;"
3274,BOOK I.,"And ocean too, with all its solemn noise,"
3275,BOOK I.,Has from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air
3276,BOOK I.,Is emptied of thine hoary majesty.
3277,BOOK I.,"Thy thunder, conscious of the new command,                   60"
3278,BOOK I.,Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house;
3279,BOOK I.,And thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands
3280,BOOK I.,Scorches and burns our once serene domain.
3281,BOOK I.,O aching time! O moments big as years!
3282,BOOK I.,"All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth,"
3283,BOOK I.,And press it so upon our weary griefs
3284,BOOK I.,That unbelief has not a space to breathe.
3285,BOOK I.,"Saturn, sleep on:--O thoughtless, why did I"
3286,BOOK I.,Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude?
3287,BOOK I.,Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes?                        70
3288,BOOK I.,"Saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep."""
3289,BOOK I.,
3290,BOOK I.,"As when, upon a tranced summer-night,"
3291,BOOK I.,"Those green-rob'd senators of mighty woods,"
3292,BOOK I.,"Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,"
3293,BOOK I.,"Dream, and so dream all night without a stir,"
3294,BOOK I.,Save from one gradual solitary gust
3295,BOOK I.,"Which comes upon the silence, and dies off,"
3296,BOOK I.,As if the ebbing air had but one wave;
3297,BOOK I.,So came these words and went; the while in tears
3298,BOOK I.,"She touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground,           80"
3299,BOOK I.,Just where her falling hair might be outspread
3300,BOOK I.,A soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet.
3301,BOOK I.,"One moon, with alteration slow, had shed"
3302,BOOK I.,"Her silver seasons four upon the night,"
3303,BOOK I.,"And still these two were postured motionless,"
3304,BOOK I.,Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern;
3305,BOOK I.,"The frozen God still couchant on the earth,"
3306,BOOK I.,And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet:
3307,BOOK I.,Until at length old Saturn lifted up
3308,BOOK I.,"His faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone,                    90"
3309,BOOK I.,"And all the gloom and sorrow of the place,"
3310,BOOK I.,"And that fair kneeling Goddess; and then spake,"
3311,BOOK I.,"As with a palsied tongue, and while his beard"
3312,BOOK I.,Shook horrid with such aspen-malady:
3313,BOOK I.,"""O tender spouse of gold Hyperion,"
3314,BOOK I.,"Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy face;"
3315,BOOK I.,"Look up, and let me see our doom in it;"
3316,BOOK I.,"Look up, and tell me if this feeble shape"
3317,BOOK I.,"Is Saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the voice"
3318,BOOK I.,"Of Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow,                 100"
3319,BOOK I.,"Naked and bare of its great diadem,"
3320,BOOK I.,Peers like the front of Saturn. Who had power
3321,BOOK I.,To make me desolate? whence came the strength?
3322,BOOK I.,"How was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth,"
3323,BOOK I.,While Fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp?
3324,BOOK I.,"But it is so; and I am smother'd up,"
3325,BOOK I.,And buried from all godlike exercise
3326,BOOK I.,"Of influence benign on planets pale,"
3327,BOOK I.,"Of admonitions to the winds and seas,"
3328,BOOK I.,"Of peaceful sway above man's harvesting,                    110"
3329,BOOK I.,And all those acts which Deity supreme
3330,BOOK I.,Doth ease its heart of love in.--I am gone
3331,BOOK I.,Away from my own bosom: I have left
3332,BOOK I.,"My strong identity, my real self,"

3339,BOOK I.,"Search, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest"
3340,BOOK I.,"A certain shape or shadow, making way"
3341,BOOK I.,With wings or chariot fierce to repossess
3342,BOOK I.,A heaven he lost erewhile: it must--it must

3348,BOOK I.,"Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir                    130"
3349,BOOK I.,Of strings in hollow shells; and there shall be
3350,BOOK I.,"Beautiful things made new, for the surprise"

3352,BOOK I.,"Thea! Thea! Thea! where is Saturn?"""
3353,BOOK I.,
3354,BOOK I.,"This passion lifted him upon his feet,"
3355,BOOK I.,"And made his hands to struggle in the air,"
3356,BOOK I.,"His Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat,"
3357,BOOK I.,"His eyes to fever out, his voice to cease."
3358,BOOK I.,"He stood, and heard not Thea's sobbing deep;"

3370,BOOK I.,"""This cheers our fallen house: come to our friends,       150"
3371,BOOK I.,"O Saturn! come away, and give them heart;"
3372,BOOK I.,"I know the covert, for thence came I hither."""
3373,BOOK I.,Thus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went
3374,BOOK I.,With backward footing through the shade a space:
3375,BOOK I.,"He follow'd, and she turn'd to lead the way"

3379,BOOK I.,"Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,"

3385,BOOK I.,But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept
3386,BOOK I.,"His sov'reignty, and rule, and majesty;--"
3387,BOOK I.,Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire
3388,BOOK I.,"Still sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up"

3390,BOOK I.,For as among us mortals omens drear
3391,BOOK I.,"Fright and perplex, so also shuddered he--                  170"
3392,BOOK I.,"Not at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech,"

3398,BOOK I.,"Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold,"
3399,BOOK I.,"And touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks,"
3400,BOOK I.,"Glar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts,"
3401,BOOK I.,"Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries;                     180"
3402,BOOK I.,And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds
3403,BOOK I.,"Flush'd angerly: while sometimes eagle's wings,"
3404,BOOK I.,"Unseen before by Gods or wondering men,"

3416,BOOK I.,"With stride colossal, on from hall to hall;"
3417,BOOK I.,"While far within each aisle and deep recess,"
3418,BOOK I.,"His winged minions in close clusters stood,"

3430,BOOK I.,"And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape,"
3431,BOOK I.,"In fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye,                 210"
3432,BOOK I.,That inlet to severe magnificence
3433,BOOK I.,"Stood full blown, for the God to enter in."
3434,BOOK I.,
3435,BOOK I.,"He enter'd, but he enter'd full of wrath;"
3436,BOOK I.,"His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels,"
3437,BOOK I.,"And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,"
3438,BOOK I.,That scar'd away the meek ethereal Hours
3439,BOOK I.,"And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared,"
3440,BOOK I.,"From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,"
3441,BOOK I.,"Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light,"
3442,BOOK I.,"And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades,                    220"
3443,BOOK I.,Until he reach'd the great main cupola;
3444,BOOK I.,"There standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot,"

3475,BOOK I.,For as in theatres of crowded men
3476,BOOK I.,"Hubbub increases more they call out ""Hush!"""
3477,BOOK I.,So at Hyperion's words the Phantoms pale
3478,BOOK I.,"Bestirr'd themselves, thrice horrible and cold;"

3500,BOOK I.,Which sages and keen-eyed astrologers
3501,BOOK I.,"Then living on the earth, with labouring thought"

3532,BOOK I.,"And sky-engendered, Son of Mysteries                        310"
3533,BOOK I.,All unrevealed even to the powers
3534,BOOK I.,Which met at thy creating; at whose joys
3535,BOOK I.,"And palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft,"
3536,BOOK I.,"I, Coelus, wonder, how they came and whence;"
3537,BOOK I.,"And at the fruits thereof what shapes they be,"
3538,BOOK I.,"Distinct, and visible; symbols divine,"
3539,BOOK I.,Manifestations of that beauteous life
3540,BOOK I.,Diffus'd unseen throughout eternal space:
3541,BOOK I.,"Of these new-form'd art thou, oh brightest child!"
3542,BOOK I.,"Of these, thy brethren and the Goddesses!                   320"
3543,BOOK I.,"There is sad feud among ye, and rebellion"
3544,BOOK I.,"Of son against his sire. I saw him fall,"
3545,BOOK I.,I saw my first-born tumbled from his throne!
3546,BOOK I.,"To me his arms were spread, to me his voice"
3547,BOOK I.,Found way from forth the thunders round his head!
3548,BOOK I.,"Pale wox I, and in vapours hid my face."
3549,BOOK I.,"Art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is:"
3550,BOOK I.,For I have seen my sons most unlike Gods.
3551,BOOK I.,"Divine ye were created, and divine"
3552,BOOK I.,"In sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd,                      330"
3553,BOOK I.,"Unruffled, like high Gods, ye liv'd and ruled:"
3554,BOOK I.,"Now I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath;"
3555,BOOK I.,Actions of rage and passion; even as
3556,BOOK I.,"I see them, on the mortal world beneath,"
3557,BOOK I.,"In men who die.--This is the grief, O Son!"
3558,BOOK I.,"Sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall!"
3559,BOOK I.,"Yet do thou strive; as thou art capable,"
3560,BOOK I.,"As thou canst move about, an evident God;"
3561,BOOK I.,And canst oppose to each malignant hour
3562,BOOK I.,Ethereal presence:--I am but a voice;                       340
3563,BOOK I.,"My life is but the life of winds and tides,"
3564,BOOK I.,No more than winds and tides can I avail:--
3565,BOOK I.,But thou canst.--Be thou therefore in the van
3566,BOOK I.,"Of circumstance; yea, seize the arrow's barb"
3567,BOOK I.,Before the tense string murmur.--To the earth!
3568,BOOK I.,"For there thou wilt find Saturn, and his woes."
3569,BOOK I.,"Meantime I will keep watch on thy bright sun,"
3570,BOOK I.,"And of thy seasons be a careful nurse.""--"
3571,BOOK I.,"Ere half this region-whisper had come down,"
3572,BOOK I.,"Hyperion arose, and on the stars                            350"
3573,BOOK I.,"Lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide"
3574,BOOK I.,Until it ceas'd; and still he kept them wide:
3575,BOOK I.,"And still they were the same bright, patient stars."
3576,BOOK I.,"Then with a slow incline of his broad breast,"
3577,BOOK I.,"Like to a diver in the pearly seas,"
3578,BOOK I.,"Forward he stoop'd over the airy shore,"
3579,BOOK I.,And plung'd all noiseless into the deep night.
3580,BOOK I.,
3581,BOOK I.,
3582,BOOK II.,BOOK II.
3583,BOOK II.,
3584,BOOK II.,Just at the self-same beat of Time's wide wings
3585,BOOK II.,"Hyperion slid into the rustled air,"
3586,BOOK II.,And Saturn gain'd with Thea that sad place
3587,BOOK II.,Where Cybele and the bruised Titans mourn'd.
3588,BOOK II.,It was a den where no insulting light
3589,BOOK II.,Could glimmer on their tears; where their own groans
3590,BOOK II.,"They felt, but heard not, for the solid roar"
3591,BOOK II.,"Of thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse,"
3592,BOOK II.,"Pouring a constant bulk, uncertain where."
3593,BOOK II.,"Crag jutting forth to crag, and rocks that seem'd            10"
3594,BOOK II.,"Ever as if just rising from a sleep,"
3595,BOOK II.,Forehead to forehead held their monstrous horns;
3596,BOOK II.,And thus in thousand hugest phantasies
3597,BOOK II.,Made a fit roofing to this nest of woe.
3598,BOOK II.,"Instead of thrones, hard flint they sat upon,"
3599,BOOK II.,"Couches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge"
3600,BOOK II.,Stubborn'd with iron. All were not assembled:
3601,BOOK II.,"Some chain'd in torture, and some wandering."
3602,BOOK II.,"Coeus, and Gyges, and Briareüs,"
3603,BOOK II.,"Typhon, and Dolor, and Porphyrion,                           20"
3604,BOOK II.,"With many more, the brawniest in assault,"
3605,BOOK II.,Were pent in regions of laborious breath;
3606,BOOK II.,"Dungeon'd in opaque element, to keep"
3607,BOOK II.,"Their clenched teeth still clench'd, and all their limbs"
3608,BOOK II.,"Lock'd up like veins of metal, crampt and screw'd;"
3609,BOOK II.,"Without a motion, save of their big hearts"
3610,BOOK II.,"Heaving in pain, and horribly convuls'd"
3611,BOOK II.,With sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse.
3612,BOOK II.,Mnemosyne was straying in the world;
3613,BOOK II.,Far from her moon had Phoebe wandered;                       30
3614,BOOK II.,"And many else were free to roam abroad,"
3615,BOOK II.,"But for the main, here found they covert drear."
3616,BOOK II.,"Scarce images of life, one here, one there,"
3617,BOOK II.,Lay vast and edgeways; like a dismal cirque
3618,BOOK II.,"Of Druid stones, upon a forlorn moor,"
3619,BOOK II.,"When the chill rain begins at shut of eve,"
3620,BOOK II.,"In dull November, and their chancel vault,"
3621,BOOK II.,"The Heaven itself, is blinded throughout night."
3622,BOOK II.,"Each one kept shroud, nor to his neighbour gave"
3623,BOOK II.,"Or word, or look, or action of despair.                      40"
3624,BOOK II.,Creüs was one; his ponderous iron mace
3625,BOOK II.,"Lay by him, and a shatter'd rib of rock"
3626,BOOK II.,"Told of his rage, ere he thus sank and pined."
3627,BOOK II.,"Iäpetus another; in his grasp,"
3628,BOOK II.,A serpent's plashy neck; its barbed tongue
3629,BOOK II.,"Squeez'd from the gorge, and all its uncurl'd length"
3630,BOOK II.,Dead; and because the creature could not spit
3631,BOOK II.,Its poison in the eyes of conquering Jove.
3632,BOOK II.,"Next Cottus: prone he lay, chin uppermost,"
3633,BOOK II.,As though in pain; for still upon the flint                  50
3634,BOOK II.,"He ground severe his skull, with open mouth"
3635,BOOK II.,And eyes at horrid working. Nearest him
3636,BOOK II.,"Asia, born of most enormous Caf,"
3637,BOOK II.,"Who cost her mother Tellus keener pangs,"
3638,BOOK II.,"Though feminine, than any of her sons:"
3639,BOOK II.,"More thought than woe was in her dusky face,"
3640,BOOK II.,For she was prophesying of her glory;
3641,BOOK II.,And in her wide imagination stood
3642,BOOK II.,"Palm-shaded temples, and high rival fanes,"
3643,BOOK II.,By Oxus or in Ganges' sacred isles.                          60
3644,BOOK II.,"Even as Hope upon her anchor leans,"
3645,BOOK II.,"So leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk"
3646,BOOK II.,Shed from the broadest of her elephants.
3647,BOOK II.,"Above her, on a crag's uneasy shelve,"
3648,BOOK II.,"Upon his elbow rais'd, all prostrate else,"
3649,BOOK II.,Shadow'd Enceladus; once tame and mild
3650,BOOK II.,As grazing ox unworried in the meads;
3651,BOOK II.,"Now tiger-passion'd, lion-thoughted, wroth,"
3652,BOOK II.,"He meditated, plotted, and even now"
3653,BOOK II.,"Was hurling mountains in that second war,                    70"
3654,BOOK II.,"Not long delay'd, that scar'd the younger Gods"
3655,BOOK II.,To hide themselves in forms of beast and bird.
3656,BOOK II.,Not far hence Atlas; and beside him prone
3657,BOOK II.,"Phorcus, the sire of Gorgons. Neighbour'd close"
3658,BOOK II.,"Oceanus, and Tethys, in whose lap"
3659,BOOK II.,Sobb'd Clymene among her tangled hair.
3660,BOOK II.,"In midst of all lay Themis, at the feet"
3661,BOOK II.,Of Ops the queen all clouded round from sight;
3662,BOOK II.,"No shape distinguishable, more than when"
3663,BOOK II.,Thick night confounds the pine-tops with the clouds:         80
3664,BOOK II.,And many else whose names may not be told.
3665,BOOK II.,"For when the Muse's wings are air-ward spread,"
3666,BOOK II.,Who shall delay her flight? And she must chaunt
3667,BOOK II.,"Of Saturn, and his guide, who now had climb'd"
3668,BOOK II.,With damp and slippery footing from a depth
3669,BOOK II.,More horrid still. Above a sombre cliff
3670,BOOK II.,"Their heads appear'd, and up their stature grew"
3671,BOOK II.,Till on the level height their steps found ease:
3672,BOOK II.,Then Thea spread abroad her trembling arms
3673,BOOK II.,"Upon the precincts of this nest of pain,                     90"
3674,BOOK II.,And sidelong fix'd her eye on Saturn's face:
3675,BOOK II.,There saw she direst strife; the supreme God
3676,BOOK II.,"At war with all the frailty of grief,"
3677,BOOK II.,"Of rage, of fear, anxiety, revenge,"
3678,BOOK II.,"Remorse, spleen, hope, but most of all despair."
3679,BOOK II.,Against these plagues he strove in vain; for Fate
3680,BOOK II.,"Had pour'd a mortal oil upon his head,"
3681,BOOK II.,"A disanointing poison: so that Thea,"
3682,BOOK II.,"Affrighted, kept her still, and let him pass"
3683,BOOK II.,"First onwards in, among the fallen tribe.                   100"
3684,BOOK II.,
3685,BOOK II.,"As with us mortal men, the laden heart"
3686,BOOK II.,"Is persecuted more, and fever'd more,"
3687,BOOK II.,When it is nighing to the mournful house
3688,BOOK II.,Where other hearts are sick of the same bruise;
3689,BOOK II.,"So Saturn, as he walk'd into the midst,"
3690,BOOK II.,"Felt faint, and would have sunk among the rest,"
3691,BOOK II.,"But that he met Enceladus's eye,"
3692,BOOK II.,"Whose mightiness, and awe of him, at once"
3693,BOOK II.,"Came like an inspiration; and he shouted,"
3694,BOOK II.,"""Titans, behold your God!"" at which some groan'd;           110"
3695,BOOK II.,Some started on their feet; some also shouted;
3696,BOOK II.,"Some wept, some wail'd, all bow'd with reverence;"
3697,BOOK II.,"And Ops, uplifting her black folded veil,"
3698,BOOK II.,"Show'd her pale cheeks, and all her forehead wan,"
3699,BOOK II.,"Her eye-brows thin and jet, and hollow eyes."
3700,BOOK II.,There is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines
3701,BOOK II.,When Winter lifts his voice; there is a noise
3702,BOOK II.,"Among immortals when a God gives sign,"
3703,BOOK II.,"With hushing finger, how he means to load"
3704,BOOK II.,"His tongue with the full weight of utterless thought,       120"
3705,BOOK II.,"With thunder, and with music, and with pomp:"
3706,BOOK II.,Such noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines;
3707,BOOK II.,"Which, when it ceases in this mountain'd world,"
3708,BOOK II.,"No other sound succeeds; but ceasing here,"
3709,BOOK II.,"Among these fallen, Saturn's voice therefrom"
3710,BOOK II.,"Grew up like organ, that begins anew"
3711,BOOK II.,"Its strain, when other harmonies, stopt short,"
3712,BOOK II.,Leave the dinn'd air vibrating silverly.
3713,BOOK II.,"Thus grew it up--""Not in my own sad breast,"
3714,BOOK II.,"Which is its own great judge and searcher out,              130"
3715,BOOK II.,Can I find reason why ye should be thus:
3716,BOOK II.,"Not in the legends of the first of days,"
3717,BOOK II.,Studied from that old spirit-leaved book
3718,BOOK II.,Which starry Uranus with finger bright
3719,BOOK II.,"Sav'd from the shores of darkness, when the waves"
3720,BOOK II.,Low-ebb'd still hid it up in shallow gloom;--
3721,BOOK II.,And the which book ye know I ever kept
3722,BOOK II.,"For my firm-based footstool:--Ah, infirm!"
3723,BOOK II.,"Not there, nor in sign, symbol, or portent"
3724,BOOK II.,"Of element, earth, water, air, and fire,--                  140"
3725,BOOK II.,"At war, at peace, or inter-quarreling"
3726,BOOK II.,"One against one, or two, or three, or all"
3727,BOOK II.,"Each several one against the other three,"
3728,BOOK II.,As fire with air loud warring when rain-floods
3729,BOOK II.,"Drown both, and press them both against earth's face,"
3730,BOOK II.,"Where, finding sulphur, a quadruple wrath"
3731,BOOK II.,"Unhinges the poor world;--not in that strife,"
3732,BOOK II.,"Wherefrom I take strange lore, and read it deep,"
3733,BOOK II.,Can I find reason why ye should be thus:
3734,BOOK II.,"No, no-where can unriddle, though I search,                 150"
3735,BOOK II.,And pore on Nature's universal scroll
3736,BOOK II.,"Even to swooning, why ye, Divinities,"
3737,BOOK II.,"The first-born of all shap'd and palpable Gods,"
3738,BOOK II.,"Should cower beneath what, in comparison,"
3739,BOOK II.,"Is untremendous might. Yet ye are here,"
3740,BOOK II.,"O'erwhelm'd, and spurn'd, and batter'd, ye are here!"
3741,BOOK II.,"O Titans, shall I say 'Arise!'--Ye groan:"
3742,BOOK II.,Shall I say 'Crouch!'--Ye groan. What can I then?
3743,BOOK II.,O Heaven wide! O unseen parent dear!
3744,BOOK II.,"What can I? Tell me, all ye brethren Gods,                  160"
3745,BOOK II.,"How we can war, how engine our great wrath!"
3746,BOOK II.,"O speak your counsel now, for Saturn's ear"
3747,BOOK II.,"Is all a-hunger'd. Thou, Oceanus,"
3748,BOOK II.,Ponderest high and deep; and in thy face
3749,BOOK II.,"I see, astonied, that severe content"
3750,BOOK II.,"Which comes of thought and musing: give us help!"""
3751,BOOK II.,
3752,BOOK II.,"So ended Saturn; and the God of the Sea,"
3753,BOOK II.,"Sophist and sage, from no Athenian grove,"
3754,BOOK II.,"But cogitation in his watery shades,"
3755,BOOK II.,"Arose, with locks not oozy, and began,                      170"
3756,BOOK II.,"In murmurs, which his first-endeavouring tongue"
3757,BOOK II.,Caught infant-like from the far-foamed sands.
3758,BOOK II.,"""O ye, whom wrath consumes! who, passion-stung,"
3759,BOOK II.,"Writhe at defeat, and nurse your agonies!"
3760,BOOK II.,"Shut up your senses, stifle up your ears,"
3761,BOOK II.,My voice is not a bellows unto ire.
3762,BOOK II.,"Yet listen, ye who will, whilst I bring proof"
3763,BOOK II.,"How ye, perforce, must be content to stoop:"
3764,BOOK II.,"And in the proof much comfort will I give,"
3765,BOOK II.,If ye will take that comfort in its truth.                  180
3766,BOOK II.,"We fall by course of Nature's law, not force"
3767,BOOK II.,"Of thunder, or of Jove. Great Saturn, thou"
3768,BOOK II.,Hast sifted well the atom-universe;
3769,BOOK II.,"But for this reason, that thou art the King,"
3770,BOOK II.,"And only blind from sheer supremacy,"
3771,BOOK II.,"One avenue was shaded from thine eyes,"
3772,BOOK II.,Through which I wandered to eternal truth.
3773,BOOK II.,"And first, as thou wast not the first of powers,"
3774,BOOK II.,So art thou not the last; it cannot be:
3775,BOOK II.,Thou art not the beginning nor the end.                     190
3776,BOOK II.,From chaos and parental darkness came
3777,BOOK II.,"Light, the first fruits of that intestine broil,"
3778,BOOK II.,"That sullen ferment, which for wondrous ends"
3779,BOOK II.,"Was ripening in itself. The ripe hour came,"
3780,BOOK II.,"And with it light, and light, engendering"
3781,BOOK II.,"Upon its own producer, forthwith touch'd"
3782,BOOK II.,The whole enormous matter into life.
3783,BOOK II.,"Upon that very hour, our parentage,"
3784,BOOK II.,"The Heavens and the Earth, were manifest:"
3785,BOOK II.,"Then thou first-born, and we the giant-race,                200"
3786,BOOK II.,Found ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms.
3787,BOOK II.,"Now comes the pain of truth, to whom 'tis pain;"
3788,BOOK II.,"O folly! for to bear all naked truths,"
3789,BOOK II.,"And to envisage circumstance, all calm,"
3790,BOOK II.,That is the top of sovereignty. Mark well!
3791,BOOK II.,"As Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far"
3792,BOOK II.,"Than Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs;"
3793,BOOK II.,And as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth
3794,BOOK II.,"In form and shape compact and beautiful,"
3795,BOOK II.,"In will, in action free, companionship,                     210"
3796,BOOK II.,And thousand other signs of purer life;
3797,BOOK II.,"So on our heels a fresh perfection treads,"
3798,BOOK II.,"A power more strong in beauty, born of us"
3799,BOOK II.,"And fated to excel us, as we pass"
3800,BOOK II.,In glory that old Darkness: nor are we
3801,BOOK II.,"Thereby more conquer'd, than by us the rule"
3802,BOOK II.,"Of shapeless Chaos. Say, doth the dull soil"
3803,BOOK II.,"Quarrel with the proud forests it hath fed,"
3804,BOOK II.,"And feedeth still, more comely than itself?"
3805,BOOK II.,Can it deny the chiefdom of green groves?                   220
3806,BOOK II.,Or shall the tree be envious of the dove
3807,BOOK II.,"Because it cooeth, and hath snowy wings"
3808,BOOK II.,To wander wherewithal and find its joys?
3809,BOOK II.,"We are such forest-trees, and our fair boughs"
3810,BOOK II.,"Have bred forth, not pale solitary doves,"
3811,BOOK II.,"But eagles golden-feather'd, who do tower"
3812,BOOK II.,"Above us in their beauty, and must reign"
3813,BOOK II.,In right thereof; for 'tis the eternal law
3814,BOOK II.,That first in beauty should be first in might:
3815,BOOK II.,"Yea, by that law, another race may drive                    230"
3816,BOOK II.,Our conquerors to mourn as we do now.
3817,BOOK II.,"Have ye beheld the young God of the Seas,"
3818,BOOK II.,My dispossessor? Have ye seen his face?
3819,BOOK II.,"Have ye beheld his chariot, foam'd along"
3820,BOOK II.,By noble winged creatures he hath made?
3821,BOOK II.,"I saw him on the calmed waters scud,"
3822,BOOK II.,"With such a glow of beauty in his eyes,"
3823,BOOK II.,That it enforc'd me to bid sad farewell
3824,BOOK II.,"To all my empire: farewell sad I took,"
3825,BOOK II.,"And hither came, to see how dolorous fate                   240"
3826,BOOK II.,Had wrought upon ye; and how I might best
3827,BOOK II.,Give consolation in this woe extreme.
3828,BOOK II.,"Receive the truth, and let it be your balm."""
3829,BOOK II.,
3830,BOOK II.,"Whether through poz'd conviction, or disdain,"
3831,BOOK II.,"They guarded silence, when Oceanus"
3832,BOOK II.,"Left murmuring, what deepest thought can tell?"
3833,BOOK II.,"But so it was, none answer'd for a space,"
3834,BOOK II.,"Save one whom none regarded, Clymene;"
3835,BOOK II.,"And yet she answer'd not, only complain'd,"
3836,BOOK II.,"With hectic lips, and eyes up-looking mild,                 250"
3837,BOOK II.,Thus wording timidly among the fierce:
3838,BOOK II.,"""O Father, I am here the simplest voice,"
3839,BOOK II.,"And all my knowledge is that joy is gone,"
3840,BOOK II.,"And this thing woe crept in among our hearts,"
3841,BOOK II.,"There to remain for ever, as I fear:"
3842,BOOK II.,"I would not bode of evil, if I thought"
3843,BOOK II.,So weak a creature could turn off the help
3844,BOOK II.,Which by just right should come of mighty Gods;
3845,BOOK II.,"Yet let me tell my sorrow, let me tell"
3846,BOOK II.,"Of what I heard, and how it made me weep,                   260"
3847,BOOK II.,And know that we had parted from all hope.
3848,BOOK II.,"I stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore,"
3849,BOOK II.,Where a sweet clime was breathed from a land
3850,BOOK II.,"Of fragrance, quietness, and trees, and flowers."
3851,BOOK II.,"Full of calm joy it was, as I of grief;"
3852,BOOK II.,Too full of joy and soft delicious warmth;
3853,BOOK II.,So that I felt a movement in my heart
3854,BOOK II.,"To chide, and to reproach that solitude"
3855,BOOK II.,"With songs of misery, music of our woes;"
3856,BOOK II.,"And sat me down, and took a mouthed shell                   270"
3857,BOOK II.,"And murmur'd into it, and made melody--"
3858,BOOK II.,"O melody no more! for while I sang,"
3859,BOOK II.,And with poor skill let pass into the breeze
3860,BOOK II.,"The dull shell's echo, from a bowery strand"
3861,BOOK II.,"Just opposite, an island of the sea,"
3862,BOOK II.,"There came enchantment with the shifting wind,"
3863,BOOK II.,That did both drown and keep alive my ears.
3864,BOOK II.,"I threw my shell away upon the sand,"
3865,BOOK II.,"And a wave fill'd it, as my sense was fill'd"
3866,BOOK II.,With that new blissful golden melody.                       280
3867,BOOK II.,"A living death was in each gush of sounds,"
3868,BOOK II.,"Each family of rapturous hurried notes,"
3869,BOOK II.,"That fell, one after one, yet all at once,"
3870,BOOK II.,Like pearl beads dropping sudden from their string:
3871,BOOK II.,"And then another, then another strain,"
3872,BOOK II.,"Each like a dove leaving its olive perch,"
3873,BOOK II.,"With music wing'd instead of silent plumes,"
3874,BOOK II.,"To hover round my head, and make me sick"

4141,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.
4142,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,
4143,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"_Lamia_, like _Endymion_, is written in the heroic couplet, but the"
4144,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,difference in style is very marked. The influence of Dryden's
4145,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,narrative-poems (his translations from Boccaccio and Chaucer) is clearly
4146,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"traceable in the metre, style, and construction of the later poem. Like"
4147,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"Dryden, Keats now makes frequent use of the Alexandrine, or 6-foot line,"
4148,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,and of the triplet. He has also restrained the exuberance of his
4149,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"language and gained force, whilst in imaginative power and felicity of"
4150,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,diction he surpasses anything of which Dryden was capable. The flaws in
4151,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,his style are mainly due to carelessness in the rimes and some
4152,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,questionable coining of words. He also occasionally lapses into the
4153,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,vulgarity and triviality which marred certain of his early poems.
4154,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,
4155,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"The best he gained from his study of Dryden's _Fables_, a debt perhaps"
4156,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"to Chaucer rather than to Dryden, was a notable advance in constructive"
4157,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,power. In _Lamia_ he shows a very much greater sense of proportion and
4158,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"power of selection than in his earlier work. There is, as it were, more"
4159,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,light and shade.
4160,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,
4161,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,Thus we find that whenever the occasion demands it his style rises to
4162,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"supreme force and beauty. The metamorphosis of the serpent, the entry"
4163,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"of Lamia and Lycius into Corinth, the building by Lamia of the Fairy"
4164,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"Hall, and her final withering under the eye of Apollonius--these are the"
4165,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"most important points in the story, and the passages in which they are"
4166,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,described are also the most striking in the poem.
4167,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,
4168,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"The allegorical meaning of the story seems to be, that it is fatal to"
4169,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,attempt to separate the sensuous and emotional life from the life of
4170,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"reason. Philosophy alone is cold and destructive, but the pleasures of"
4171,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,the senses alone are unreal and unsatisfying. The man who attempts such
4172,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,a divorce between the two parts of his nature will fail miserably as did
4173,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"Lycius, who, unable permanently to exclude reason, was compelled to face"
4174,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"the death of his illusions, and could not, himself, survive them."
4175,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,
4176,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"Of the poem Keats himself says, writing to his brother in September,"
4177,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,1819: 'I have been reading over a part of a short poem I have composed
4178,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"lately, called _Lamia_, and I am certain there is that sort of fire in"
4179,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,it that must take hold of people some way; give them either pleasant or
4180,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,unpleasant sensation--what they want is a sensation of some sort.' But
4181,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"to the greatest of Keats's critics, Charles Lamb, the poem appealed"
4182,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"somewhat differently, for he writes, 'More exuberantly rich in imagery"
4183,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,and painting [than _Isabella_] is the story of _Lamia_. It is of as
4184,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"gorgeous stuff as ever romance was composed of,' and, after enumerating"
4185,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"the most striking pictures in the poem, he adds, '[these] are all that"
4186,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,"fairy-land can do for us.' _Lamia_ struck his imagination, but his heart"
4187,INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.,was given to _Isabella_.

4743,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,
4744,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,PAGE 59. ll. 153-60. Keats wants to make it clear that he is not trying

4752,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,
4753,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,PAGE 60. l. 174. _Cut . . . bone._ This is not only a vivid way of
4754,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,"describing the banishment of all their natural pity. It also, by the"
4755,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,"metaphor used, gives us a sort of premonitory shudder as at Lorenzo's"
4756,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,"death. Indeed, in that moment the murder is, to all intents and"
4757,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,"purposes, done. In stanza xxvii they are described as riding 'with their"

4767,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,"the pale murderers, sick with suspense, and the unsuspecting victim,"
4768,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,full of glowing life.

4774,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,
4775,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,PAGE 63. l. 217. Notice the reticence with which the mere fact of the
4776,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,murder is stated--no details given. Keats wants the prevailing feeling
4777,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,to be one of pity rather than of horror.
4778,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,
4779,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,ll. 219-20. _Ah . . . loneliness._ We perpetually come upon this old
4780,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,belief--that the souls of the murdered cannot rest in peace. Cf.

4782,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,
4783,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,l. 221. _break-covert . . . sin._ The blood-hounds employed for tracking
4784,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,"down a murderer will find him under any concealment, and never rest till"

4793,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,"uncertainly, scarce knowing what they did."

4796,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,their deed--the guilt of murder--that is all.
4797,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,
4798,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,"l. 229. _stifling_: partly literal, since the widow's weed is"

4801,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,
4802,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,"l. 230. _accursed bands._ So long as a man hopes he is not free, but at"

4826,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,
4827,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,PAGE 66. ll. 267 seq. These comparisons help us to realize her
4828,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,"experience as sharp anguish, rousing her from the lethargy of despair,"
4829,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,and endowing her for a brief space with almost supernatural energy and
4830,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,willpower.
4831,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,
4832,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,"PAGE 67. l. 286. _palsied Druid._ The Druids, or priests of ancient"
4833,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,"Britain, are always pictured as old men with long beards. The conception"
4834,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,"of such an old man, tremblingly trying to get music from a broken harp,"
4835,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,adds to the pathos and mystery of the vision.

4843,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,l. 292. _unthread . . . woof._ His narration and explanation of what has

4861,NOTES ON ISABELLA.,itself seems to be composed of moving atoms. The experience with which

5183,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",
5184,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","These four odes, which were all written in 1819, the first three in the"
5185,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","early months of that year, ought to be considered together, since the"
5186,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","same strain of thought runs through them all and, taken all together,"
5187,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",they seem to sum up Keats's philosophy.
5188,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",
5189,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","In all of them the poet looks upon life as it is, and the eternal"
5190,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","principle of beauty, in the first three seeing them in sharp contrast;"
5191,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","in the last reconciling them, and leaving us content."
5192,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",
5193,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","The first-written of the four, the _Ode to a Nightingale_, is the most"
5194,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",passionately human and personal of them all. For Keats wrote it soon
5195,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","after the death of his brother Tom, whom he had loved devotedly and"
5196,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",himself nursed to the end. He was feeling keenly the tragedy of a world
5197,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","'where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies', and the song of"
5198,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","the nightingale, heard in a friend's garden at Hampstead, made him long"
5199,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",to escape with it from this world of realities and sorrows to the world
5200,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","of ideal beauty, which it seemed to him somehow to stand for and"
5201,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","suggest. He did not think of the nightingale as an individual bird, but"
5202,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","of its song, which had been beautiful for centuries and would continue"
5203,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",to be beautiful long after his generation had passed away; and the
5204,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",thought of this undying loveliness he contrasted bitterly with our
5205,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","feverishly sad and short life. When, by the power of imagination, he had"
5206,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",left the world behind him and was absorbed in the vision of beauty
5207,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","roused by the bird's song, he longed for death rather than a return to"
5208,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",disillusionment.
5209,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",
5210,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","So in the _Grecian Urn_ he contrasts unsatisfying human life with art,"
5211,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",which is everlastingly beautiful. The figures on the vase lack one thing
5212,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","only--reality,--whilst on the other hand they are happy in not being"
5213,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","subject to trouble, change, or death. The thought is sad, yet Keats"
5214,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","closes this ode triumphantly, not, as in _The Nightingale_, on a note of"
5215,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","disappointment. The beauty of this Greek sculpture, truly felt, teaches"
5216,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","us that beauty at any rate is real and lasting, and that utter belief in"
5217,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",beauty is the one thing needful in life.
5218,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",
5219,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","In the _Ode on Melancholy_ Keats, in a more bitter mood, finds the"
5220,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","presence, in a fleeting world, of eternal beauty the source of the"
5221,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","deepest melancholy. To encourage your melancholy mood, he tells us, do"
5222,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","not look on the things counted sad, but on the most beautiful, which are"
5223,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",only quickly-fading manifestations of the everlasting principle of
5224,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","beauty. It is then, when a man most deeply loves the beautiful, when he"
5225,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","uses his capacities of joy to the utmost, that the full bitterness of"
5226,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",the contrast between the real and the ideal comes home to him and
5227,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",crushes him. If he did not feel so much he would not suffer so much; if
5228,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",he loved beauty less he would care less that he could not hold it long.
5229,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",
5230,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",But in the ode _To Autumn_ Keats attains to the serenity he has been
5231,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",seeking. In this unparalleled description of a richly beautiful autumn
5232,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",day he conveys to us all the peace and comfort which his spirit
5233,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",receives. He does not philosophize upon the spectacle or draw a moral
5234,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","from it, but he shows us how in nature beauty is ever present. To the"
5235,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","momentary regret for spring he replies with praise of the present hour,"
5236,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",concluding with an exquisite description of the sounds of autumn--its
5237,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","music, as beautiful as that of spring. Hitherto he has lamented the"
5238,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","insecurity of a man's hold upon the beautiful, though he has never"
5239,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","doubted the reality of beauty and the worth of its worship to man. Now,"
5240,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","under the influence of nature, he intuitively knows that beauty once"
5241,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",seen and grasped is man's possession for ever. He is in much the same
5242,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",position that Wordsworth was when he declared that
5243,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",
5244,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",Nature never did betray
5245,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,"
5246,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","Through all the years of this our life, to lead"
5247,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",From joy to joy: for she can so inform
5248,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","The mind that is within us, so impress"
5249,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","With quietness and beauty, and so feed"
5250,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,"
5251,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,"
5252,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all"
5253,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","The dreary intercourse of daily life,"
5254,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb"
5255,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold"
5256,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",Is full of blessings.
5257,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",
5258,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","This was not the last poem that Keats wrote, but it was the last which"
5259,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.",he wrote in the fulness of his powers. We can scarcely help wishing
5260,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","that, beautiful as were some of the productions of his last feverish"
5261,"MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.","year of life, this perfect ode, expressing so serene and untroubled a"

5267,NOTES ON THE ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE.,In the early months of 1819 Keats was living with his friend Brown at
5268,NOTES ON THE ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE.,Hampstead (Wentworth Place). In April a nightingale built her nest in
5269,NOTES ON THE ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE.,"the garden, and Brown writes: 'Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy"
5270,NOTES ON THE ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE.,in her song; and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast table
5271,NOTES ON THE ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE.,"to the grass-plot under a plum, where he sat for two or three hours."
5272,NOTES ON THE ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE.,When he came into the house I perceived he had some scraps of paper in
5273,NOTES ON THE ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE.,"his hand, and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books. On"

5468,INTRODUCTION TO FANCY.,
5469,INTRODUCTION TO FANCY.,"This poem, although so much lighter in spirit, bears a certain relation"
5470,INTRODUCTION TO FANCY.,in thought to Keats's other odes. In the _Nightingale_ the tragedy of
5471,INTRODUCTION TO FANCY.,"this life made him long to escape, on the wings of imagination, to the"
5472,INTRODUCTION TO FANCY.,ideal world of beauty symbolized by the song of the bird. Here finding
5473,INTRODUCTION TO FANCY.,"all real things, even the most beautiful, pall upon him, he extols the"
5474,INTRODUCTION TO FANCY.,"fancy, which can escape from reality and is not tied by place or season"
5475,INTRODUCTION TO FANCY.,"in its search for new joys. This is, of course, only a passing mood, as"
5476,INTRODUCTION TO FANCY.,the extempore character of the poetry indicates. We see more of settled
5477,INTRODUCTION TO FANCY.,"conviction in the deeply-meditative _Ode to Autumn_, where he finds the"
5478,INTRODUCTION TO FANCY.,ideal in the rich and ever-changing real.

5550,INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD.,
5551,INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD.,"Early in 1818 John Hamilton Reynolds, a friend of Keats, sent him two"
5552,INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD.,"sonnets which he had written 'On Robin Hood'. Keats, in his letter of"
5553,INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD.,"thanks, after giving an appreciation of Reynolds's production, says: 'In"
5554,INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD.,"return for your Dish of Filberts, I have gathered a few Catkins, I hope"
5555,INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD.,"they'll look pretty.' Then follow these lines, entitled, 'To J. H. R. in"
5556,INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD.,answer to his Robin Hood sonnets.' At the end he writes: 'I hope you
5557,INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD.,will like them--they are at least written in the spirit of outlawry.'
5558,INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD.,
5559,INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD.,"Robin Hood, the outlaw, was a popular hero of the Middle Ages. He was a"
5560,INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD.,"great poacher of deer, brave, chivalrous, generous, full of fun, and"
5561,INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD.,absolutely without respect for law and order. He robbed the rich to give
5562,INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD.,"to the poor, and waged ceaseless war against the wealthy prelates of the"
5563,INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD.,"church. Indeed, of his endless practical jokes, the majority were played"
5564,INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD.,"upon sheriffs and bishops. He lived, with his 'merry men', in Sherwood"

5680,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.
5681,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,
5682,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,This poem deals with the overthrow of the primaeval order of Gods by
5683,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"Jupiter, son of Saturn the old king. There are many versions of the"
5684,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"fable in Greek mythology, and there are many sources from which it may"
5685,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,have come to Keats. At school he is said to have known the classical
5686,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"dictionary by heart, but his inspiration is more likely to have been due"
5687,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"to his later reading of the Elizabethan poets, and their translations of"
5688,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"classic story. One thing is certain, that he did not confine himself to"
5689,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"any one authority, nor did he consider it necessary to be circumscribed"
5690,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"by authorities at all. He used, rather than followed, the Greek fable,"
5691,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,dealing freely with it and giving it his own interpretation.
5692,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,
5693,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"The situation when the poem opens is as follows:--Saturn, king of the"
5694,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"gods, has been driven from Olympus down into a deep dell, by his son"
5695,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"Jupiter, who has seized and used his father's weapon, the thunderbolt. A"
5696,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"similar fate has overtaken nearly all his brethren, who are called by"
5697,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"Keats Titans and Giants indiscriminately, though in Greek mythology the"
5698,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,two races are quite distinct. These Titans are the children of Tellus
5699,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"and Coelus, the earth and sky, thus representing, as it were, the first"
5700,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,birth of form and personality from formless nature. Before the
5701,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"separation of earth and sky, Chaos, a confusion of the elements of all"
5702,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"things, had reigned supreme. One only of the Titans, Hyperion the"
5703,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"sun-god, still keeps his kingdom, and he is about to be superseded by"
5704,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"young Apollo, the god of light and song."
5705,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,
5706,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,In the second book we hear Oceanus and Clymene his daughter tell how
5707,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"both were defeated not by battle or violence, but by the irresistible"
5708,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,beauty of their dispossessors; and from this Oceanus deduces 'the
5709,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"eternal law, that first in beauty should be first in might'. He recalls"
5710,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"the fact that Saturn himself was not the first ruler, but received his"
5711,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"kingdom from his parents, the earth and sky, and he prophesies that"
5712,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,progress will continue in the overthrow of Jove by a yet brighter and
5713,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"better order. Enceladus is, however, furious at what he considers a"
5714,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"cowardly acceptance of their fate, and urges his brethren to resist."
5715,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,
5716,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"In Book I we saw Hyperion, though still a god, distressed by portents,"
5717,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"and now in Book III we see the rise to divinity of his successor, the"
5718,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,young Apollo. The poem breaks off short at the moment of Apollo's
5719,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"metamorphosis, and how Keats intended to complete it we can never know."
5720,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,
5721,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"It is certain that he originally meant to write an epic in ten books,"
5722,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,and the publisher's remark[245:1] at the beginning of the 1820 volume
5723,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,would lead us to think that he was in the same mind when he wrote the
5724,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"poem. This statement, however, must be altogether discounted, as Keats,"
5725,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"in his copy of the poems, crossed it right out and wrote above, 'I had"
5726,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,no part in this; I was ill at the time.'
5727,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,
5728,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"Moreover, the last sentence (from 'but' to 'proceeding') he bracketed,"
5729,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"writing below, 'This is a lie.'"
5730,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,
5731,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"This, together with other evidence external and internal, has led Dr. de"
5732,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"Sélincourt to the conclusion that Keats had modified his plan and, when"
5733,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"he was writing the poem, intended to conclude it in four books. Of the"
5734,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,probable contents of the one-and-half unwritten books Mr. de Sélincourt
5735,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"writes: 'I conceive that Apollo, now conscious of his divinity, would"
5736,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"have gone to Olympus, heard from the lips of Jove of his newly-acquired"
5737,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"supremacy, and been called upon by the rebel three to secure the kingdom"
5738,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"that awaited him. He would have gone forth to meet Hyperion, who, struck"
5739,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"by the power of supreme beauty, would have found resistance impossible."
5740,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,Critics have inclined to take for granted the supposition that an actual
5741,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"battle was contemplated by Keats, but I do not believe that such was, at"
5742,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"least, his final intention. In the first place, he had the example of"
5743,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"Milton, whom he was studying very closely, to warn him of its dangers;"
5744,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"in the second, if Hyperion had been meant to fight he would hardly be"
5745,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"represented as already, before the battle, shorn of much of his"
5746,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,strength; thus making the victory of Apollo depend upon his enemy's
5747,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,unnatural weakness and not upon his own strength. One may add that a
5748,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,combat would have been completely alien to the whole idea of the poem as
5749,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"Keats conceived it, and as, in fact, it is universally interpreted from"
5750,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,the speech of Oceanus in the second book. The resistance of Enceladus
5751,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"and the Giants, themselves rebels against an order already established,"
5752,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"would have been dealt with summarily, and the poem would have closed"
5753,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,with a description of the new age which had been inaugurated by the
5754,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"triumph of the Olympians, and, in particular, of Apollo the god of light"
5755,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,and song.'
5756,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,
5757,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"The central idea, then, of the poem is that the new age triumphs over"
5758,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,the old by virtue of its acknowledged superiority--that intellectual
5759,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,supremacy makes physical force feel its power and yield. Dignity and
5760,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"moral conquest lies, for the conquered, in the capacity to recognize the"
5761,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,truth and look upon the inevitable undismayed.
5762,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,
5763,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"Keats broke the poem off because it was too 'Miltonic', and it is easy"
5764,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,to see what he meant. Not only does the treatment of the subject recall
5765,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"that of _Paradise Lost_, the council of the fallen gods bearing special"
5766,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"resemblance to that of the fallen angels in Book II of Milton's epic,"
5767,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,but in its style and syntax the influence of Milton is everywhere
5768,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,apparent. It is to be seen in the restraint and concentration of the
5769,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"language, which is in marked contrast to the wordiness of Keats's early"
5770,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"work, as well as in the constant use of classical constructions,[247:1]"
5771,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"Miltonic inversions[247:2] and repetitions,[247:3] and in occasional"
5772,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,reminiscences of actual lines and phrases in _Paradise Lost_.[247:4]
5773,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,
5774,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"In _Hyperion_ we see, too, the influence of the study of Greek"
5775,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,sculpture upon Keats's mind and art. This study had taught him that the
5776,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,highest beauty is not incompatible with definiteness of form and
5777,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,clearness of detail. To his romantic appreciation of mystery was now
5778,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"added an equal sense of the importance of simplicity, form, and"
5779,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"proportion, these being, from its nature, inevitable characteristics of"
5780,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,the art of sculpture. So we see that again and again the figures
5781,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"described in _Hyperion_ are like great statues--clear-cut, massive, and"
5782,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"motionless. Such are the pictures of Saturn and Thea in Book I, and of"
5783,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,each of the group of Titans at the opening of Book II.
5784,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,
5785,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,Striking too is Keats's very Greek identification of the gods with the
5786,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,powers of Nature which they represent. It is this attitude of mind which
5787,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"has led some people--Shelley and Landor among them--to declare Keats, in"
5788,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"spite of his ignorance of the language, the most truly Greek of all"
5789,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,English poets. Very beautiful instances of this are the sunset and
5790,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"sunrise in Book I, when the departure of the sun-god and his return to"
5791,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,earth are so described that the pictures we see are of an evening and
5792,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"morning sky, an angry sunset, and a grey and misty dawn."
5793,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,
5794,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,But neither Miltonic nor Greek is Keats's marvellous treatment of nature
5795,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"as he feels, and makes us feel, the magic of its mystery in such a"
5796,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,picture as that of the
5797,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,
5798,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,tall oaks
5799,INTRODUCTION TO HYPERION.,"Branch-charmèd by the earnest stars,"
