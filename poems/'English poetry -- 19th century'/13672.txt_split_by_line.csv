12,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.
13,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,
14,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,
15,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"To this edition of ""The Unknown Eros"" are added all the other poems I have"
16,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"written, in what I venture--because it has no other name--to call"
17,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"""catalectic verse.""  Nearly all English metres owe their existence as"
18,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"metres to ""catalexis,"" or pause, for the time of one or more feet, and, as"
19,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"a rule, the position and amount of catalexis are fixed.  But the verse in"
20,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"which this volume is written is catalectic par excellence, employing the"
21,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,pause (as it does the rhyme) with freedom only limited by the exigencies
22,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"of poetic passion.  From the time of Drummond of Hawthornden to our own,"
23,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,some of the noblest flights of English poetry have been taken on the wings
24,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,of this verse; but with ordinary readers it has been more or less
25,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"discredited by the far greater number of abortive efforts, on the part"
26,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"sometimes of considerable poets, to adapt it to purposes with which it"
27,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,has no expressional correspondence; or to vary it by rhythmical movements
28,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,which are destructive of its character.
29,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,
30,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"Some persons, unlearned in the subject of metre, have objected to this kind"
31,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"of verse that it is ""lawless.""  But it has its laws as truly as any other."
32,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"In its highest order, the lyric or ""ode,"" it is a tetrameter, the line"
33,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"having the time of eight iambics.  When it descends to narrative, or the"
34,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"expression of a less-exalted strain of thought, it becomes a trimeter,"
35,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"having the time of six iambics, or even a dimeter, with the time of four;"
36,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"and it is allowable to vary the tetrameter ""ode"" by the occasional"
37,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"introduction of passages in either or both of these inferior measures, but"
38,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"not, I think, by the use of any other.  The license to rhyme at indefinite"
39,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"intervals is counterbalanced, in the writing of all poets who have employed"
40,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"this metre successfully, by unusual frequency in the recurrence of the same"
41,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,rhyme.  For information on the generally overlooked but primarily important
42,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,function of catalexis in English verse I refer such readers as may be
43,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,curious about the subject to the Essay printed as an appendix to the later
44,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,editions of my collected poems.
45,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,
46,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,I do not pretend to have done more than very moderate justice to the
47,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,exceeding grace and dignity and the inexhaustible expressiveness of which
48,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,this kind of metre is capable; but I can say that I have never attempted to
49,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,write in it in the absence of that one justification of and prime
50,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"qualification for its use, namely, the impulse of some thought that"
51,PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.,"""voluntary moved harmonious numbers."""

175,PROEM.,"Thus, in reproof of my despondency,"

177,PROEM.,"O, season strange for song!"
178,PROEM.,And yet some timely power persuades my lips.
179,PROEM.,"Is't England's parting soul that nerves my tongue,"
180,PROEM.,"As other Kingdoms, nearing their eclipse,"

183,PROEM.,"Is it her sudden, loud and piercing cry,"
184,PROEM.,The note which those that seem too weak to sigh
185,PROEM.,Will sometimes utter just before they die?
186,PROEM.,"Lo, weary of the greatness of her ways,"
187,PROEM.,"There lies my Land, with hasty pulse and hard,"
188,PROEM.,"Her ancient beauty marr'd,"
189,PROEM.,"And, in her cold and aimless roving sight,"
190,PROEM.,Horror of light;
191,PROEM.,"Sole vigour left in her last lethargy,"
192,PROEM.,"Save when, at bidding of some dreadful breath,"
193,PROEM.,The rising death
194,PROEM.,Rolls up with force;
195,PROEM.,And then the furiously gibbering corse
196,PROEM.,"Shakes, panglessly convuls'd, and sightless stares,"
197,PROEM.,"Whilst one Physician pours in rousing wines,"
198,PROEM.,"One anodynes,"
199,PROEM.,And one declares
200,PROEM.,That nothing ails it but the pains of growth.

202,PROEM.,"Is taken; and I turn, with the relief"
203,PROEM.,Of knowing that my life-long hope and grief
204,PROEM.,"Are surely vain,"

206,PROEM.,"A dim, heroic Nation long since dead,"
207,PROEM.,"The foulness of her agony forgot,"
208,PROEM.,Shall all benignly shed
209,PROEM.,Through ages vast
210,PROEM.,The ghostly grace of her transfigured past
211,PROEM.,"Over the present, harass'd and forlorn,"
212,PROEM.,Of nations yet unborn;
213,PROEM.,And this shall be the lot
214,PROEM.,"Of those who, in the bird-voice and the blast"
215,PROEM.,"Of her omniloquent tongue,"
216,PROEM.,Have truly sung
217,PROEM.,"Or greatly said,"
218,PROEM.,To shew as one
219,PROEM.,"With those who have best done,"
220,PROEM.,"And be as rays,"
221,PROEM.,"Thro' the still altering world, around her changeless head."

227,PROEM.,"At latest eve,"
228,PROEM.,That does in each calm note
229,PROEM.,Both joy and grieve;
230,PROEM.,"Notes few and strong and fine,"
231,PROEM.,"Gilt with sweet day's decline,"
232,PROEM.,And sad with promise of a different sun.
233,PROEM.,'Mid the loud concert harsh
234,PROEM.,"Of this fog-folded marsh,"
235,PROEM.,"To me, else dumb,"
236,PROEM.,"Uranian Clearness, come!"
237,PROEM.,Give me to breathe in peace and in surprise
238,PROEM.,"The light-thrill'd ether of your rarest skies,"

798,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"But, kneeling in a Church, one Easter-Day,"

808,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"Did thee, my own most Dear,"
809,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"Possess,"
810,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"In gay, celestial beauty nothing coy,"
811,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,And felt thy soft caress

813,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"But, in our mortal air,"
814,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"None thrives for long upon the happiest dream,"

821,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"In agony, I cried:"
822,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"'My Lord, if thy strange will be this,"

842,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"In a fair stranger, as I take it, bred"
843,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"To her some tender heed,"
844,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,Most innocent
845,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"Of purpose therewith blent,"
846,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"And pure of faith, I think, to thee; yet such"
847,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"That the pale reflex of an alien love,"
848,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"So vaguely, sadly shown,"
849,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,Did her heart touch
850,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,Above
851,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"All that, till then, had woo'd her for its own."
852,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"And so the fear, which is love's chilly dawn,"
853,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"Flush'd faintly upon lids that droop'd like thine,"
854,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"And made me weak,"
855,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"By thy delusive likeness doubly drawn,"
856,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,And Nature's long suspended breath of flame
857,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"Persuading soft, and whispering Duty's name,"
858,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,Awhile to smile and speak
859,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"With this thy Sister sweet, and therefore mine;"
860,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,"Thy Sister sweet,"
861,XI.  TIRED MEMORY.,Who bade the wheels to stir
