26,INTRODUCTION.,INTRODUCTION.
27,INTRODUCTION.,
28,INTRODUCTION.,
29,INTRODUCTION.,"Over Street Ballads may be raised the wail of “Ichabod, Ichabod, their"
30,INTRODUCTION.,"glory is departed.” They held their own for many centuries, bravely and"
31,INTRODUCTION.,"well, but have succumbed to a changed order of things, and a new"
32,INTRODUCTION.,"generation has arisen, who will not stop in the streets to listen to"
33,INTRODUCTION.,"these ballads being sung, but prefer to have their music served up to"
34,INTRODUCTION.,"them “piping hot,” with the accompaniment of warmth, light, beer, and"
35,INTRODUCTION.,tobacco (for which they duly have to pay) at the Music Halls; but
36,INTRODUCTION.,"whether the change be for the better, or not, may be a moot question."
37,INTRODUCTION.,
38,INTRODUCTION.,These Street Ballads were produced within a very few hours of the
39,INTRODUCTION.,"publication of any event of the slightest public interest; and, failing"
40,INTRODUCTION.,"that, the singers had always an unlimited store to fall back upon, on"
41,INTRODUCTION.,"domestic, or humorous subjects, love, the sea, etc., etc. Of their"
42,INTRODUCTION.,"variety we may learn something, not only from this book, but from the"
43,INTRODUCTION.,ballad of “Chaunting Benny” of which the following is a portion:--
44,INTRODUCTION.,
45,INTRODUCTION.,..........
46,INTRODUCTION.,
47,INTRODUCTION.,"“My songs have had a tidy run, I’ve plenty in my fist, Sirs,"
48,INTRODUCTION.,"And if you wish to pick one out, I’ll just run through my list, Sirs."
49,INTRODUCTION.,
50,INTRODUCTION.,"Have you seen “My daughter Fan,” “She wore a wreath of roses,”"
51,INTRODUCTION.,"And here you see “My son Tom,” “The Sun that lights the roses,”"
52,INTRODUCTION.,"“Green grow the rushes O,” “On the Banks of Allan Water,”"
53,INTRODUCTION.,"“Such a getting out of bed,” with “Brave Lord Ullin’s daughter.”"
54,INTRODUCTION.,
55,INTRODUCTION.,"“Poor Bessie was a Sailor’s bride,” “Sitting on a rail,” Sirs,"
56,INTRODUCTION.,"“Is there a heart that never loved?” “The Rose of Allandale,” Sirs,"
57,INTRODUCTION.,"“The Maid of Judah,” “Out of Place,” with “Plenty to be sad at,”"
58,INTRODUCTION.,"“I say, my rum un, who are you?” with “What a shocking"
59,INTRODUCTION.,"bad hat,” etc., etc."
60,INTRODUCTION.,
61,INTRODUCTION.,"Rough though some of these Street Ballads may be, very few of them were"
62,INTRODUCTION.,"coarse, and, on reading them, we must ever bear in mind the class for"
63,INTRODUCTION.,"whom they were produced, who listened to them, and--practical proof of"
64,INTRODUCTION.,interest--bought them. In this collection I have introduced nothing
65,INTRODUCTION.,"which can offend anybody except an absolute prude; in fact, “My bear"
66,INTRODUCTION.,dances only to the genteelest of tunes.”
67,INTRODUCTION.,
68,INTRODUCTION.,There are plenty of my readers old enough to remember many of these
69,INTRODUCTION.,"Ballads, and they will come none the worse because they bring with them"
70,INTRODUCTION.,the reminiscence of their youth. _Forsan et hæc olim meminisse juvabit._
71,INTRODUCTION.,They owe a great deal of their charm to the fact that they were
72,INTRODUCTION.,"absolutely contemporary with the events they describe, and, though"
73,INTRODUCTION.,"sometimes rather faulty in their history, owing to the pressure under"
74,INTRODUCTION.,"which they were composed and issued, yet those very inaccuracies prove"
75,INTRODUCTION.,their freshness.
76,INTRODUCTION.,
77,INTRODUCTION.,"The majority were illustrated--if, indeed, any can be called"
78,INTRODUCTION.,illustrated--for the woodcuts were generally served out with a charming
79,INTRODUCTION.,"impartiality, and without the slightest regard to the subject of the"
80,INTRODUCTION.,"ballad. What previous work these blocks had served, goodness only knows;"
81,INTRODUCTION.,"they were probably bought at trade sales, and had illustrated books that"
82,INTRODUCTION.,were out of date or unsaleable. They vary from the sixteenth century to
83,INTRODUCTION.,"Bewick, some of whose works are occasionally met with; but, taking them"
84,INTRODUCTION.,"as a whole, we must fain confess that art as applied to these Ballads"
85,INTRODUCTION.,was at its very lowest. Their literary merit is not great--but what can
86,INTRODUCTION.,"you expect for half-a-crown? which was the price which Jemmy Catnach,[1]"
87,INTRODUCTION.,"of Monmouth Court, Seven Dials, used to pay for their production."
88,INTRODUCTION.,"Catnach issued a large number from his press (in fact, his successor,"
89,INTRODUCTION.,"Fortey, advertised that he had four thousand different sorts for sale),"
90,INTRODUCTION.,and his name is used as a “household word” to designate this class of
91,INTRODUCTION.,"Ballad. But, in fact, he only enjoyed the largest share of the London"
92,INTRODUCTION.,"trade, whilst the Provinces were practically independent--Liverpool,"
93,INTRODUCTION.,"Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle, Preston, Hull, Sheffield, Durham,"
94,INTRODUCTION.,"etc., had their own ballad-mongers, who wrote somewhat after the manner"
95,INTRODUCTION.,of the author of “The Bard of Seven Dials.”
96,INTRODUCTION.,
97,INTRODUCTION.,"“And it’s my plan, that some great man"
98,INTRODUCTION.,"Dies with a broken head, Sirs,"
99,INTRODUCTION.,"Vith a bewail, I does detail"
100,INTRODUCTION.,"His death ’afore e’s dead, Sirs."
101,INTRODUCTION.,"And while his friends and foes contends,"
102,INTRODUCTION.,"They all my papers buy, Sirs,"
103,INTRODUCTION.,"Yes, vithout doubt, I sells ’em out,"
104,INTRODUCTION.,"’Cos there my talent lies, Sirs.”"
105,INTRODUCTION.,
106,INTRODUCTION.,The Ballad singers and vendors made money rapidly over any event which
107,INTRODUCTION.,took the popular fancy--a good blood-curdling murder being very
108,INTRODUCTION.,"profitable; and the business required very little capital, even that"
109,INTRODUCTION.,"being speedily turned over. Generally, the singers worked singlehanded,"
110,INTRODUCTION.,"but sometimes two would join, and then the Ballad took an antiphonal"
111,INTRODUCTION.,"form, which must have relieved them very much, and the crowd which"
112,INTRODUCTION.,gathered round them was the surest proof that their vocal efforts were
113,INTRODUCTION.,appreciated.
114,INTRODUCTION.,
115,INTRODUCTION.,They are gone--probably irrevocably--but a trace of the vendor still
116,INTRODUCTION.,"lingers amongst us. One or two still remain about Gray’s Inn Road,"
117,INTRODUCTION.,"Farringdon Road, and other neighbourhoods; but I venture to say, as they"
118,INTRODUCTION.,"drop out, they will find no successors. You may know them, if ever lucky"
119,INTRODUCTION.,"enough to meet with one, by their canvas screens, on which are pinned"
120,INTRODUCTION.,the ballads--identical with that immortal screen of which Mr. Silas Wegg
121,INTRODUCTION.,(in Dickens’s “Our Mutual Friend”) was the proud proprietor; but these
122,INTRODUCTION.,"modern Ballads are mostly reproductions of Music Hall songs, and have"
123,INTRODUCTION.,very little in common with those about which I write.
124,INTRODUCTION.,
125,INTRODUCTION.,"I have taken the first fifty years of this century, when this style of"
126,INTRODUCTION.,"Street Ballad was at its best, but I have liberally interpreted my fifty"
127,INTRODUCTION.,"years, by extending its margin by a year or two either way--thus, I"
128,INTRODUCTION.,"include the Mutiny at the Nore in 1798, and the Great Exhibition of"
129,INTRODUCTION.,"1851, and I have selected those that bear on most, and elucidate best,"
130,INTRODUCTION.,the social manners and customs of that period.

459,_SALE OF A WIFE._,Whenever a foreigner used to write that Englishmen sold their wives
460,_SALE OF A WIFE._,"in open market, with halters round their necks, they were not"
461,_SALE OF A WIFE._,"believed in England; but it was nevertheless a fact, and even as"
462,_SALE OF A WIFE._,lately as last year a man sold his wife. In two of my books (“Old
463,_SALE OF A WIFE._,Times” and “The Dawn of the Nineteenth Century”) I have given
464,_SALE OF A WIFE._,numerous instances. The halter round the neck was used when the
465,_SALE OF A WIFE._,"wife was sold at market, it being considered that, being thus"

532,_SALE OF A WIFE._,Wives at the market did not fetch good prices; the highest I know
533,_SALE OF A WIFE._,"of, is recorded in _The Times_, September 19, 1797: “An hostler’s"
534,_SALE OF A WIFE._,"wife, in the country, lately fetched twenty-five guineas.” But this"
535,_SALE OF A WIFE._,"was extravagance, as, with the exception of a man who exchanged his"
536,_SALE OF A WIFE._,"wife for an ox, which he sold for six guineas, the next highest"
537,_SALE OF A WIFE._,quotation is three and a half guineas; but this rapidly dwindled
538,_SALE OF A WIFE._,"down to shillings, and even pence. In 1881, a wife was sold at"
539,_SALE OF A WIFE._,"Sheffield for a quart of beer; in 1862, another was purchased at"
540,_SALE OF A WIFE._,"Selby Market Cross for a pint; and the _South Wales Daily News_,"

830,_THE INCOME TAX._,"thought of the losses their employers have sustained, in order to"

832,_THE INCOME TAX._,"think that England has to compete with the whole world, and that,"
833,_THE INCOME TAX._,"on the Continent, wages are cheaper, and the men are more contented"
834,_THE INCOME TAX._,"with their lot, so that when a depression in trade occurs, it is"

836,_THE INCOME TAX._,"plenty of demagogues, who, for pay, will fan the flame of"
837,_THE INCOME TAX._,"discontent, and the result is a _strike_, injurious to all parties."
838,_THE INCOME TAX._,"On the other hand, a man has a right to sell his labour as dearly"
839,_THE INCOME TAX._,"as he can, or to refuse to sell it at all, if he so pleases, and a"
840,_THE INCOME TAX._,strike is very often the means of his getting an advance of wages

842,_THE INCOME TAX._,tardily granted.
843,_THE INCOME TAX._,
844,_THE INCOME TAX._,Naturally there are many street ballads on this vital subject to
845,_THE INCOME TAX._,"the ballad-singer’s listeners, but I have only selected one, which"

848,_THE INCOME TAX._,"wrote, “There’s a good time coming, boys,” which enjoyed immense"

2785,_THE STRANGE MAN._,
2786,_THE STRANGE MAN._,"His face was the oddest that ever was seen,"
2787,_THE STRANGE MAN._,His mouth stood across ’twixt his nose and his chin;
2788,_THE STRANGE MAN._,"Whenever he spoke it was then with his voice,"
2789,_THE STRANGE MAN._,And in talking he always made some sort of noise.
2790,_THE STRANGE MAN._,_Derry down._
2791,_THE STRANGE MAN._,
2792,_THE STRANGE MAN._,"He’d an arm on each side to work when he pleased,"

2797,_THE STRANGE MAN._,
2798,_THE STRANGE MAN._,"His legs, as folks say, he could move at his will,"

2800,_THE STRANGE MAN._,"If you were to see him, you’d laugh till you burst,"
2801,_THE STRANGE MAN._,For one leg or the other would always be first.
2802,_THE STRANGE MAN._,_Derry down._
2803,_THE STRANGE MAN._,
2804,_THE STRANGE MAN._,"And, as people say, if you gave him some meat,"

2806,_THE STRANGE MAN._,"And when he is dry, if you give him the pot,"
2807,_THE STRANGE MAN._,The liquor most commonly runs down his throat.

2816,_THE STRANGE MAN._,"Another misfortune befel this poor yeoman,"
2817,_THE STRANGE MAN._,"For when he was married his wife was a woman,"
2818,_THE STRANGE MAN._,"And if you’ll believe me tho’ he was revil’d,"
2819,_THE STRANGE MAN._,You may truly aver he was never with child.
2820,_THE STRANGE MAN._,_Derry down._
2821,_THE STRANGE MAN._,
2822,_THE STRANGE MAN._,"And if it be true, as I have heard tell,"

2824,_THE STRANGE MAN._,"He gave a large gasp, open’d his mouth so wide,"
2825,_THE STRANGE MAN._,"And, by some means or other, this poor fellow died."
2826,_THE STRANGE MAN._,_Derry down._
2827,_THE STRANGE MAN._,
2828,_THE STRANGE MAN._,"But the reason he died, and the cause of his death,"
2829,_THE STRANGE MAN._,"Was owing, poor soul, to the want of more breath,"
2830,_THE STRANGE MAN._,"And now he is left in the grave for to moulder,"

3725,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"To tell you the truth I am bound,"
3726,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"What happen’d to me, by going to Sea,"
3727,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,And of the wonders which I found.
3728,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"Shipwrecked I once was off Perouse,"
3729,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"And cast upon the shore,"
3730,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"So I resolved to take a cruise,"
3731,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,The Country to explore.
3732,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,
3733,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"But far I had not scudded out,"
3734,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"When close alongside to the ocean,"
3735,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"I saw something move, which at first I thought,"
3736,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,Was all the earth in motion.
3737,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"But steering up alongside,"
3738,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"I found ’twas a Crocodile,"
3739,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,And from his nose to the tip of his tail
3740,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,He measured five hundred mile.
3741,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,
3742,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"This Crocodile, I could plainly see,"
3743,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"Was not of a common race,"
3744,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,For I was obliged to climb a very high tree
3745,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,Before I could see his face.
3746,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,
3747,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"And when he lifted up his jaw,"
3748,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"Though perhaps you'll think 'twas a lie,"
3749,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"It reach'd 'bove the clouds for miles three score,"
3750,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,And his nose nearly touched the sky.
3751,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,
3752,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"Whilst up aloft, and the stream was high,"
3753,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"It blew a gale from the south,"
3754,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"I lost my hold, and away did fly,"
3755,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,Right into the Crocodile's mouth.
3756,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"He quickly closed his jaws on me,"
3757,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"And thought to grab a victim,"
3758,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"But I ran down his throat d'ye see,"
3759,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,And that's the way I tricked him.
3760,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,
3761,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"I travell'd on for a month or two,"
3762,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"Till I got into his maw,"
3763,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"Where I found of rum kegs not a few,"
3764,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,And a thousand bullocks in store.
3765,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"Of life I banish'd all my cares,"
3766,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"For in grub I was not stinted,"
3767,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"So in this Crocodile I lived ten years,"
3768,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,Very well contented.
3769,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,
3770,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"This Crocodile being very old,"
3771,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"One day, alas! he died,"
3772,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"But he was three years a getting cold,"
3773,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,He was so long and wide.
3774,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"His skin was ten miles thick, I'm sure,"
3775,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,Or very near about;
3776,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"For I was full six years or more,"
3777,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,Cutting a hole for to get out.
3778,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,
3779,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"But now once more I’ve got on earth,"
3780,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"And resolv’d no more to roam,"
3781,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"So in a ship that pass’d, I got a berth,"
3782,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,And now I’m safe at home.
3783,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"And lest my story you should doubt,"
3784,_THE WONDERFUL CROCODILE._,"Should you ever travel the Nile,"

3800,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,And knocked off his arm above his elbow.
3801,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,
3802,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,When the surgeon came to look at the wound
3803,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"A noted thief lay on the ground,"
3804,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"Quite dead, but still he’d a perfect arm,"

3806,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,
3807,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"Now this arm he spliced to our hero’s stump,"
3808,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"And bound it fast, wasn’t he a trump?"

3810,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,As many of that brave corps can tell.
3811,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,
3812,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"This man he turned out a thief,"
3813,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"And was discharged for stealing beef,"

3816,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,
3817,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"Then up to London he did repair,"

3820,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"The arm was at work, and found him in prog."
3821,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,
3822,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"And when he got there he walked along,"
3823,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"And strove to bustle through the throng,"
3824,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"But the arm kept diving in every one’s pocket,"
3825,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"He tried all he could, but he couldn’t stop it."
3826,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,
3827,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"It stole him watches, gold and rings,"
3828,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"And many other precious things,"
3829,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"And one night he found he’d wealth in store,"
3830,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"For Bandanna wipes, he had a score."
3831,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,
3832,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"He robbed the Bank and Treasury,"
3833,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"Likewise a Poet at the play,"
3834,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"And, one night, ’tis really said,"
3835,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,He stole a glass eye from an old woman’s head.
3836,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,
3837,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,Now this arm had such a propensity
3838,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"For stealing, that it could not stay,"
3839,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"It robb’d a regiment of its baggage,"
3840,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,Likewise a tailor of all his cabbage.
3841,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,
3842,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"Long time he carried on the trade,"
3843,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"Until he had a fortune made,"
3844,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"But for a crime he was afterwards taken,"
3845,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,And sent by the Judge to be hung up like bacon.
3846,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,
3847,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"And when he came to the gallows tree,"
3848,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"With the Parson’s watch he did make free,"
3849,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"And as Jack Ketch was tying the knot,"
3850,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,He pick’d his pocket of all he’d got.
3851,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,
3852,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"Now this man, he was buried, as you may suppose,"
3853,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"And after that the arm arose,"
3854,_THE THIEF’S ARM._,"And join’d a body-snatching knave,"

3866,_CORK LEG._,"One day he had stuffed him as full as an egg,"
3867,_CORK LEG._,"When a poor relation came to beg,"

3870,_CORK LEG._,
3871,_CORK LEG._,"A surgeon, the first in his vocation,"
3872,_CORK LEG._,"Came, and made a long oration,"
3873,_CORK LEG._,"He wanted a limb for anatomization,"

3875,_CORK LEG._,
3876,_CORK LEG._,"Said Mynheer, said he, when he’d done his work,"
3877,_CORK LEG._,"By your sharp knife, I lost one fork,"

3885,_CORK LEG._,
3886,_CORK LEG._,"The leg was made and fitted tight,"
3887,_CORK LEG._,"Inspection the artist did invite,"
3888,_CORK LEG._,"The fine shape gave Mynheer delight,"

3890,_CORK LEG._,
3891,_CORK LEG._,"He walked through squares, and past each shop,"
3892,_CORK LEG._,"Of speed he went to the utmost top,"

3894,_CORK LEG._,And he found his leg he could not stop.
3895,_CORK LEG._,
3896,_CORK LEG._,"Horror and fright were in his face,"
3897,_CORK LEG._,The neighbours thought he was running a race;
3898,_CORK LEG._,"He clung to a gas-post to stay his pace,"
3899,_CORK LEG._,"But the leg wouldn’t stop, but kept on the chace."
3900,_CORK LEG._,
3901,_CORK LEG._,"Then he call’d to some men with all his might,"

5178,_HODGE IN LONDON._,ALTHOUGH the Mutiny of the Fleet at the Nore does not properly

5180,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"was of such national importance for the time being, that I venture"
5181,_HODGE IN LONDON._,to insert a ballad respecting it. The Navy was in a bad state. Many
5182,_HODGE IN LONDON._,men had been impressed; they were badly paid and badly fed; and
5183,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"their punishment, for the slightest infraction of discipline, was"
5184,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"fearful, 50 to 500 lashes, according to the temper of the captain,"
5185,_HODGE IN LONDON._,being no infrequent punishment for very venial offences. Early in
5186,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"the year the men sent in very respectful memorials to Lord Howe,"
5187,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"telling him of their grievances. No notice was taken of it, and the"
5188,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"men, probably ignorantly, committed a gross breach of discipline in"
5189,_HODGE IN LONDON._,combining together and opening communications with each other
5190,_HODGE IN LONDON._,throughout the Fleet. They plotted to seize the ships and expel the
5191,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"officers; but it became known, and the Admiral gave orders to sail"
5192,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"to sea. The men refused to do so, until their grievances had been"
5193,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"looked into and redressed. This was promised and granted, but still"
5194,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"the men were suspicious that faith would not be kept with them, and"
5195,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"they set some of their officers ashore. Lord Howe, however, went to"
5196,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"the Fleet at St. Helen’s, and showed them an Act of Parliament,"
5197,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"granting their demands, and this pacified that portion of the"
5198,_HODGE IN LONDON._,Fleet.
5199,_HODGE IN LONDON._,
5200,_HODGE IN LONDON._,But at the Nore there was open mutiny; they blockaded the entrance
5201,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"to the Thames, and fired on several ships entering or departing."
5202,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"This could not be endured, and the Admiralty removed the buoys."
5203,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"Provisions ran short, and some men-of-war were sent alongside, with"
5204,_HODGE IN LONDON._,orders to sink those ships that did not surrender. They gave in one
5205,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"by one, and the chief ringleader, Richard Parker (a man of some"
5206,_HODGE IN LONDON._,"education), and several others were hanged; but they were long"

5314,_VICTORY._,
5315,_VICTORY._,"Many a pleasant evening my love and I have met,"
5316,_VICTORY._,"He clasp’d me round my slender waist, and gave me kisses sweet,"
5317,_VICTORY._,"I gave to him my hand and heart, he vow’d he’d marry me,"
5318,_VICTORY._,But I did not know that my love would go on board the Victory.
5319,_VICTORY._,
5320,_VICTORY._,"My parents could not endure my love, because he was poor,"
5321,_VICTORY._,Therefore he did not presume to come within the door;

5353,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],"How they cut down each other like leeks,"
5354,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],And the Turks slaughter children like rabbits:
5355,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],"But John Bull could bear it no more,"
5356,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],"Said he, you death dealers, I’ll stop you,"
5357,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],"And if you don’t both soon give o’er,"

5359,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],
5360,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],"But the Turks supposed John was in jest,"
5361,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],"Or concluded he was but a Green-o,"
5362,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],"So they mustered their fleet all the best,"
5363,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],And lay in the Port Navarino.
5364,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],"Death and famine they carried before’t,"
5365,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],"And shot the poor Grecians by flocks, Sir,"
5366,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],"Said our Tars, “We’ll go join in the sport,"
5367,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],"And bring down a few Turkey Cocks, Sir.”"
5368,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],
5369,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],"Then our Admiral boldly went in,"

5371,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],"But they answered him with a foul grin,"
5372,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],And a dirty trick something like murder.
5373,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],"Then Codrington proudly arose,"
5374,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],"Said he, “Do they take us for dull logs?"
5375,_THE BATTLE OF NAVARINO._[42],"Well, since they’re determined on blows,"

5415,_DUKE WILLIAM’S FROLIC._[43],
5416,_DUKE WILLIAM’S FROLIC._[43],"Dressed all in their sailor’s trim, they straightway hastened to an inn,"

5419,_DUKE WILLIAM’S FROLIC._[43],"The landlady viewed them; by good words they assail her,"

5422,_DUKE WILLIAM’S FROLIC._[43],"Then up the stairs they did go, and in a room did enter,"
5423,_DUKE WILLIAM’S FROLIC._[43],"The duke did say, Landlady, please, bring wine both white and red,"
5424,_DUKE WILLIAM’S FROLIC._[43],"Before the wine was drunk out, a press-gang bold and stout,"

5427,_DUKE WILLIAM’S FROLIC._[43],"The landlady said, go upstairs, if sailors you are seeking,"

5442,_DUKE WILLIAM’S FROLIC._[43],"The Nobleman he did go down, but the duke, he refused,"
5443,_DUKE WILLIAM’S FROLIC._[43],"At which the officers did frown, and sadly him abused:"

5446,_DUKE WILLIAM’S FROLIC._[43],
5447,_DUKE WILLIAM’S FROLIC._[43],"Then straight below the duke did go, unto his comrade, Sir,"

7243,_DEATH OF WELLINGTON._[59],"He ever was victorious in every battle field,"
7244,_DEATH OF WELLINGTON._[59],He gained a fame most glorious because he’d never yield.

7246,_DEATH OF WELLINGTON._[59],"He drove Napoleon from home, in exile for to dwell,"
7247,_DEATH OF WELLINGTON._[59],"Far o’er the sea, and from his home, and all he lov’d so well,"

7250,_DEATH OF WELLINGTON._[59],
7251,_DEATH OF WELLINGTON._[59],"Then on the throne of France he placed Louis, the King, by right,"

7269,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7270,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,1 NOW it came to pass that the land had rest for seventeen years.
7271,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7272,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"2 For the Britons had subdued their enemies, even the French, and"
7273,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,restored peace to all the Continent.
7274,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7275,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"3 Nevertheless the people groaned by reason of oppression, and of the"
7276,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,multitude of taxes which was laid upon them to support the rich and the
7277,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,great with pensions and rewards.
7278,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7279,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"4 And they cried and petitioned for redress, but their prayers were not"
7280,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,heard.
7281,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7282,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"5 And George the Fourth was gathered to his fathers, and William reigned"
7283,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,in his stead.
7284,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7285,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,6 Now there was at this time a mighty man of renown called Arthur.
7286,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7287,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"7 And he gained the confidence of the King, and abused his ear with"
7288,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,falsities respecting the people.
7289,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7290,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"8 And the people were much displeased with the power of this man of war,"
7291,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,for he ruled them as he had done his soldiers.
7292,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7293,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,9 And their eyes were turned towards a certain nobleman whose
7294,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,possessions lieth north of the Tyne.
7295,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7296,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"10 Arthur feeling that he could rule no longer, resigned his authority,"
7297,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"and the King elected that nobleman, even Grey, whose possessions lieth"
7298,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"north of the Tyne, to be ruler under him over the people."
7299,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7300,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"11 And he stood before the King, and said, O King, live for ever, thy"
7301,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,people have been long afflicted with heavy burdens which they cannot
7302,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"bear, and their cries and lamentations ascend to heaven."
7303,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7304,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"12 And the King was troubled in his mind at these sayings, and he caused"
7305,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"the records of the realm to be brought before him, and then he found"
7306,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,that his subjects were not fairly represented; and he was in much
7307,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"agitation of mind, and trembled exceedingly and cried with a loud voice,"
7308,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,What shall I do?
7309,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7310,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"13 And the noble, even Grey, said unto him, We must endeavour to amend"
7311,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"these things; and, oh King, if thou wilt give me permission, such a law"
7312,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,shall be framed that all the land will rejoice.
7313,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7314,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"14 And the King said, Do as it pleaseth thee best in this matter."
7315,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7316,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"15 Then Grey called all the representatives of the people together, and"
7317,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,shewed them the new law which he had framed for the people’s benefit.
7318,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7319,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"16 But several of those who were interested with regard to money, lifted"
7320,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,up their voices against it.
7321,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7322,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"17 Nevertheless the thing did prevail, in that house, the Assembly of"
7323,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"the People, called the House of Commons."
7324,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7325,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"18 But when this same law was brought before the Lords, they laughed it"
7326,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"to scorn, saying amongst themselves, Shall we be deprived of all the"
7327,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,good things we have enjoyed so long? Shall we divide the spoil amongst
7328,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"those we despise? And, as it were, with the voice of one man, they said,"
7329,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,No!
7330,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7331,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"19 Now the High Priests of the nation consulted amongst themselves, and"
7332,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"said, Alas! what will become of us if this law passeth? We must then bid"
7333,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,farewell to all that we have held so dear.
7334,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7335,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"20 And the lamentation amongst the High Priests was very great, for"
7336,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,every one of them lamented as if he had lost his first born.
7337,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7338,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"21 And they came unto the Council of the Nation, even the House of"
7339,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"Lords, and said, We will not have this law to pass."
7340,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7341,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"22 For, although we are paid, and well paid, to teach the people, yet in"
7342,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,our wisdom it seemeth good unto us to keep them ignorant.
7343,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7344,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"23 For, be it known unto you, that, unless they are kept ignorant, and"
7345,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"deprived of power, no man can govern them."
7346,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7347,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"24 And the Lords listened unto these speeches, and would not allow the"
7348,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,good law to pass.
7349,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7350,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"25 Then stood the great and good noble, even Grey, before the King, and"
7351,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"said, thou knowest thy nobles and the high priests of the land will not"
7352,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,allow this law to pass.
7353,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7354,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,26 Therefore I lay my commission at thy feet.
7355,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7356,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"27 And the king answered and said, do as it seemeth best to thee."
7357,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7358,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"28 And Grey bowed himself to the earth, and departed from the presence"
7359,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,of the King.
7360,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7361,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"29 And the King was troubled in spirit, and he sent in haste for Arthur,"
7362,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,even the mighty man of renown.
7363,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7364,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"30 And Arthur arose, and girded up his loins, and stood before the King."
7365,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7366,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"31 And the King said unto him, Arthur, I know thee to be a man in whom"
7367,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"is the spirit of wisdom and of valour, I am sorely troubled in mind"
7368,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,respecting this affair. What shall I do?
7369,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7370,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"32 Arthur answered and said, be not troubled, neither let thy spirit be"
7371,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"cast down, for I can rule these people easily, and with a rod of iron"
7372,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"must they be ruled: grant unto me the commission, and I will make them"
7373,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,obedient.
7374,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7375,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"33 And the King said, do as seemeth good in thine own eyes."
7376,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7377,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,34 But when the people heard these things they were sorely grieved; and
7378,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,became exceedingly enraged.
7379,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7380,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"35 And said, shall this man of war, who is an enemy to liberty, reign"
7381,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,over us?
7382,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7383,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"36 And the people from the land’s end, even unto Johnny Groat’s house,"
7384,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"rose up, as it were with one consent; and in every village, and every"
7385,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"city, and in every town, did they rise up and meet together in the open"
7386,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"air to shew their hatred of Arthur, and of his oppression, and their"
7387,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,determination to be free.
7388,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7389,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"37 And the multitudes were exceeding great, that no man might number"
7390,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"them, and they bore banners, having on them painted various devices."
7391,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7392,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"38 And the cry of the people was great, and the noise of their shouting"
7393,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,was like the sound of many waters.
7394,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7395,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"39 And they cried, if Arthur is to rule us, to thy tents, O, Britons!"
7396,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7397,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"40 Now, the great, and the just men, and the good amongst the people,"
7398,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"stood up, and spake with a loud voice, saying,"
7399,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7400,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"41 Be it known unto you, O, Britons, that Arthur can do nothing without"
7401,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"money, therefore refuse you to pay taxes till you are made free."
7402,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7403,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"42 And the people shouted, and cried, We will give no money till we are"
7404,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"free; and having sung a war-like song, every man went to his own house."
7405,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7406,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"43 Now, when the king heard of these things he was sore afraid, and he"
7407,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"told Arthur to depart from his presence, and he called Grey before him."
7408,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7409,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"44 And he said, thy wisdom is great, get this bill passed, else we be"
7410,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,all dead men.
7411,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7412,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"45 And the thing was done in haste, for great fear and trembling had"
7413,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,fallen upon them.
7414,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,
7415,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"46 And the Nobles and the high priests agreed unto the bill, for they"
7416,_THE CHRONICLES OF THE POPE._,"were sore afraid, and quaked much."
