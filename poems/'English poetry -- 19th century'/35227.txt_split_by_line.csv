30,,Franz Hueffer who came into the Rossetti circle in the manner indicated
31,,in the following letter (of which the greater part is in the writing of
32,,the late Lucy Rossetti - daughter of Ford Madox Brown) was a
33,,"broad-headed, plodding, able German who wrote and spoke English"
34,,perfectly enough before his naturalization. He was somewhat heavy in his
35,,enthusiasms; and Gabriel Rossetti laughed at him a good deal. On one
36,,"occasion D.G.R. let off the following ""nursery rhyme"":--"
37,,
38,,There's a fluffy-haired German called Huffer
39,,A loud and pragmatical duffer:
40,,To stand on a tower
41,,"And shout ""Schopenhauer"""
42,,Is reckoned his mission by Huffer.
43,,
44,,There was no malice in these rhymes of Rossetti's; but even his dear
45,,"friend Morris (""Topsy"" as his intimates called him on account of his"
46,,shock of black hair) was not exempt from personal sallies of the
47,,"kind,--as this, when M. got alarmed about his increasing bulk:--"
48,,
49,,There was a young person called Topsy
50,,Who fancied he suffered from dropsy;
51,,"He shook like a jelly,"
52,,"Till the Doctor cried ""Belly!""--"
53,,Which angered; but comforted Topsy.
54,,
55,,Poor dear Morris! he had cause enough for alarm. Diabetes was only one
56,,among the agencies by which his stalwart frame was disintegrated at the
57,,age of 62.

150,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
151,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
152,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"William Morris, poet, decorative designer and socialist, was born in"
153,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"1834 at Clay Street, Walthamstow, now almost a suburb of London, at that"
154,WILLIAM MORRIS.,time a country village in Essex. He went to school at Marlborough
155,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"College and thence to Exeter College, Oxford, where he took his degree"
156,WILLIAM MORRIS.,in 1857. During his stay in the University the subsequent mode of his
157,WILLIAM MORRIS.,life was prepared and foreshadowed in two important directions. Like
158,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"most poets Morris was not what is called very assiduous ""at his book"";"
159,WILLIAM MORRIS.,the routine of college training was no more an attraction to him than
160,WILLIAM MORRIS.,the ordinary amusements and dissipations of undergraduate existence. But
161,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"he was studious all the same, reading the classics in his own somewhat"
162,WILLIAM MORRIS.,spasmodic way and exploring with even greater zeal the mysteries of
163,WILLIAM MORRIS.,mediæval lore. His fellow-worker in these studies and his most intimate
164,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"friend was and is at the present day Mr. Burne Jones, the famous"
165,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"painter, at that time a student of divinity. Artistic and literary"
166,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"pursuits thus went hand in hand, and received additional zest when the"
167,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"two young men became acquainted with Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Holman Hunt"
168,WILLIAM MORRIS.,and other painters of the Pre-Raphaelite school who came to Oxford to
169,WILLIAM MORRIS.,execute the frescoes still dimly visible on the ceiling of the Union
170,WILLIAM MORRIS.,Debating Hall. Of the aims and achievements of the Pre-Raphaelite
171,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Brotherhood, and of the revival of mediæval feeling in art and"
172,WILLIAM MORRIS.,literature originally advocated by its members ample account has been
173,WILLIAM MORRIS.,given in the memoir of Rossetti prefixed to his poems in the Tauchnitz
174,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"edition. Its influence on Morris's early work, both in matter and form,"
175,WILLIAM MORRIS.,will strike every observant reader of the opening ballads of the present
176,WILLIAM MORRIS.,collection. Later on the poet worked out for himself a distinct and
177,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"individual phase of the mediæval movement, as will be mentioned by and"
178,WILLIAM MORRIS.,by. At one time little was wanting to make Morris follow his friend
179,WILLIAM MORRIS.,Burne Jones's example and leave the pen for the brush. There is indeed
180,WILLIAM MORRIS.,still extant from his hand an unfinished picture evincing a remarkable
181,WILLIAM MORRIS.,sense of colour. He also for a short time became a pupil of the late Mr.
182,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"G. E. Street, the architect, to whose genius London owes its finest"
183,WILLIAM MORRIS.,modern Gothic building--the Law Courts in the Strand. On second
184,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"thoughts, however, Morris came to the conclusion that poetry was his"
185,WILLIAM MORRIS.,true field of action. His first literary venture was a monthly
186,WILLIAM MORRIS.,periodical started under his auspices in 1856 and called _The Oxford and
187,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Cambridge Magazine_. It contained, amongst other contributions from"
188,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Morris's pen, a prose tale of a highly romantic character, and was, as"
189,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"regards artistic tendencies, essentially a sequel of _The Germ_, the"
190,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"organ of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, begun and continued for three"
191,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"numbers only, six years before. Several of the contributors to the"
192,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"earlier venture, including Rossetti, also supported its offshoot."
193,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Neither, however, gained popular favour, and after a year's struggling"
194,WILLIAM MORRIS.,existence _The Oxford and Cambridge Magazine_ also came to an untimely
195,WILLIAM MORRIS.,end. At present both are eagerly sought for by collectors and fetch high
196,WILLIAM MORRIS.,prices at antiquarian sales. So changeable is the fate of books.
197,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
198,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"In 1859 Morris married, after having the year before brought out his"
199,WILLIAM MORRIS.,first volume of verse entitled _The Defence of Guenevere and Other
200,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Poems_. The book fell dead from the press, and it was not till it was"
201,WILLIAM MORRIS.,republished 25 years later that the world recognised in it some of the
202,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"freshest and most individual efforts of its author, whose literary"
203,WILLIAM MORRIS.,position was by that time established beyond cavil. That position the
204,WILLIAM MORRIS.,poet owed in the first instance to two works published in rapid
205,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"succession, _The Life and Death of Jason_, and _The Earthly Paradise_,"
206,WILLIAM MORRIS.,the latter a collection of tales in verse filling four stout volumes.
207,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"His remaining original works are _Love is enough_, a ""morality"" in the"
208,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"mediæval sense of the word, and _The Story of Sigurd the Volsung_, his"
209,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"longest and, in the opinion of some, his most perfect epic. In addition"
210,WILLIAM MORRIS.,to these should be mentioned the translations from the old Norse
211,WILLIAM MORRIS.,undertaken in conjunction with Mr. Magnusson the well-known Icelandic
212,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"scholar, and comprising _The Story of Grettir the Strong_ (1869), _The"
213,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Volsunga Saga, with certain songs from the Elder Edda_ (1870), and"
214,WILLIAM MORRIS.,_Three Northern Love Stories_ (1875); and finally a metrical rendering
215,WILLIAM MORRIS.,of _The Æneids of Virgil_.
216,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
217,WILLIAM MORRIS.,For a critical discussion or a detailed analysis of Morris's work this
218,WILLIAM MORRIS.,is not the place. It must be sufficient to indicate briefly the ideas
219,WILLIAM MORRIS.,which underlie that work and give it its literary _cachet_. Two main
220,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"currents, derivable perhaps from a common source but running in"
221,WILLIAM MORRIS.,different directions can be easily discerned. The subjects of his tales
222,WILLIAM MORRIS.,are almost without exception derived either from Greek myth or from
223,WILLIAM MORRIS.,mediæval folklore. After all that has been said and written of the gulf
224,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"that divides the classic from the romantic feeling--_""Barbaren und"
225,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Hellenen_"", as Heine puts it, such a conjunction might appear"
226,WILLIAM MORRIS.,incongruous. But the connecting link has here been found in the poet's
227,WILLIAM MORRIS.,mind. He looks upon his classical subject-matter through a mediæval
228,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"atmosphere, in other words he writes about Venus and Cupid and Psyche"
229,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"and Medea as a poet of Chaucer's age might have done, barring of course"
230,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"the differences of language, although in this respect also it may be"
231,WILLIAM MORRIS.,noted that the archaisms of expression affected by the modern poet
232,WILLIAM MORRIS.,appear indifferently in the Greek and the mediæval tales. The phenomenon
233,WILLIAM MORRIS.,is by no means unique in literature. Let the reader compare Chapman's
234,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Homer with Pope's, or let him open Morris's _Jason_ where the bells of"
235,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Colchis ""melodiously begin to ring"", and the meaning of the"
236,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"afore-mentioned ""mediæval atmosphere"" will at once be as palpable to him"
237,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"as it was to Keats when, reading Chapman's rude verse, after Pope's"
238,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"polished stanzas, he felt"
239,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
240,WILLIAM MORRIS.,like some watcher of the skies
241,WILLIAM MORRIS.,When a new planet swims into his ken.
242,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
243,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"It was the romantic chord of Keats's nature, that chord which vibrates"
244,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"in _La belle Dame sans Merci_, which was harmoniously struck and made"
245,WILLIAM MORRIS.,the great master of form overlook the formal imperfection of the
246,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"earlier poet. To the same element such stories as _Jason_, or _The Love"
247,WILLIAM MORRIS.,of Alcestis_ and the _Bellerophon_ in _The Earthly Paradise_ owe their
248,WILLIAM MORRIS.,charm.
249,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
250,WILLIAM MORRIS.,Morris's position towards mediæval subjects did not at first essentially
251,WILLIAM MORRIS.,differ from that of other poets of similar tendency. In his first volume
252,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"English and French knights and damsels figure prominently, and the"
253,WILLIAM MORRIS.,beautiful and frail wife of King Arthur is the heroine of the chief poem
254,WILLIAM MORRIS.,and has given her name to the book. But in the interval which elapsed
255,WILLIAM MORRIS.,between that volume and the _Earthly Paradise_ a considerable change had
256,WILLIAM MORRIS.,come over the poet's dream. By the aid of Mr. Magnusson he had become
257,WILLIAM MORRIS.,acquainted with the treasure of northern folklore hidden in the
258,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Icelandic sagas, the two Eddas, the story of the Volsungs (of which a"
259,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"masterly translation is due to the two friends), the Laxdæla saga and"
260,WILLIAM MORRIS.,other tales of more or less remote antiquity.
261,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
262,WILLIAM MORRIS.,In the _Earthly Paradise_ the double current of the poet's fancy above
263,WILLIAM MORRIS.,alluded to is most strikingly apparent. The very framework in which the
264,WILLIAM MORRIS.,various tales are set seems to have been designed with that view. Guided
265,WILLIAM MORRIS.,probably by a vague tradition of a pre-Columbian discovery of America by
266,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"the Vikings, the prologue relates how during a terrible pestilence"
267,WILLIAM MORRIS.,certain mariners leave their northern home in search of the land where
268,WILLIAM MORRIS.,old age and death are not and where life is rounded by unbroken
269,WILLIAM MORRIS.,pleasure. Sailing west they come to a fair country. They gaze on
270,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"southern sunshine and virgin forest and fertile champaign, but death"
271,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"meets them at every step, and happiness is farthest from their grasp"
272,WILLIAM MORRIS.,when the people worship them as gods and sacrifice at their shrine.
273,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Escaping from this golden thraldom they regain their ship, and after"
274,WILLIAM MORRIS.,many dangers and privations are driven by the wind to an island
275,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"inhabited by descendants of the ancient Greeks, who have preserved their"
276,WILLIAM MORRIS.,old worship and their old freedom. Here the weary wanderers of the main
277,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"are hospitably received, and here they resolve to dwell in peace,"
278,WILLIAM MORRIS.,forgetful of their vain search for the earthly paradise. At the
279,WILLIAM MORRIS.,beginning and the middle of every month the elders of the people and
280,WILLIAM MORRIS.,their guests meet together to while away the time with song and friendly
281,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"converse. The islanders relate the traditions of their Grecian home, the"
282,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"mariners relate the sagas of the North, and Laurence, a Swabian priest"
283,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"who had joined the Norsemen in their quest, contributes the legends of"
284,WILLIAM MORRIS.,Tannhäuser and of the ring given to Venus by the Roman youth. Here then
285,WILLIAM MORRIS.,there is full scope for the quaint beauty of romantic classicism and for
286,WILLIAM MORRIS.,the weird glamour of northern myth. Without encroaching upon the field
287,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"of criticism proper the writer may state that, in his opinion, amongst"
288,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"the classic tales none is more graceful and finished than ""The Golden"
289,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Apples"", and amongst the northern none more grandly developed and more"
290,WILLIAM MORRIS.,epical in the strict sense of the word than _The Lovers of Gudrun_ based
291,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"upon the Icelandic Laxdæla saga. The latter, unfortunately, cannot find"
292,WILLIAM MORRIS.,a place in this volume for reasons of space.
293,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
294,WILLIAM MORRIS.,Every student of old northern literature is aware that amongst its
295,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"remains none are more interesting as literary monuments, none more"
296,WILLIAM MORRIS.,characteristic of the people from which they sprang than the two Eddas
297,WILLIAM MORRIS.,and the Volsunga Saga. Next to the Siege of Troy and the Arthurian
298,WILLIAM MORRIS.,legends perhaps no story or agglomeration of stories has left so many
299,WILLIAM MORRIS.,and so important traces in international fiction as the tale of Sigurd
300,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"or Siegfried and his race, the heroic god-born Volsungs. Considering"
301,WILLIAM MORRIS.,indeed the political insignificance and remoteness in which that story
302,WILLIAM MORRIS.,took its earliest surviving form this enormous success--if the modern
303,WILLIAM MORRIS.,term may be applied--seems at first singularly out of proportion. But it
304,WILLIAM MORRIS.,must be remembered that Iceland was little more than the storehouse of
305,WILLIAM MORRIS.,these old traditions which were the common property of the
306,WILLIAM MORRIS.,Teuto-Scandinavian race long before the Norsemen set foot on the
307,WILLIAM MORRIS.,northern isle. Of the two modern versions of the tale which are most
308,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"thoroughly inspired by the ancient myth one, that of Wagner in his"
309,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"tetralogy _Der Ring des Nibelungen_, is dramatic in form, the other,"
310,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Morris's _The Story of Sigurd the Volsung_, bears all the"
311,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"characteristics of the epic. To this difference of artistic aim, the"
312,WILLIAM MORRIS.,difference of shape which the tale takes in the hands of the two poets
313,WILLIAM MORRIS.,may be traced. In one point however they agree. Both Wagner and Morris
314,WILLIAM MORRIS.,go back to the old Icelandic sources in preference to the mediæval
315,WILLIAM MORRIS.,German version of the tale embodied in the _Nibelungenlied_. From this
316,WILLIAM MORRIS.,the German poet borrows little more than the localization of his drama
317,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"on the banks of the river Rhine, the English poet scarcely anything but"
318,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"his metre--the _Langzeile_ or long-line with six hightoned, and any"
319,WILLIAM MORRIS.,number of unaccentuated syllables.
320,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
321,WILLIAM MORRIS.,The ordinary modern reader taking up the Volsunga Saga or either of the
322,WILLIAM MORRIS.,Eddas without preparation would probably see in them little more than a
323,WILLIAM MORRIS.,confused accumulation of impossible adventures and deeds of prowess with
324,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"an admixture of incest, fratricide and other horrors. But on looking"
325,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"closer one discovers a certain plan in this entanglement, a plan much"
326,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"obscured by the unbridled fancy of the old narrators, and hardly"
327,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"realised by themselves, but which, if properly sifted, amounts to what"
328,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"we should call a moral or idea. To ""point this moral,"" to consistently"
329,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"develop this idea, is the task of the modern poet courageous enough to"
330,WILLIAM MORRIS.,grapple with such a subject. Two ways are open to him. Either he may
331,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"wholly abandon the sequence of the old tale, and group its _disjecta"
332,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"membra_ round a leading idea as a centre, or else he may adhere to the"
333,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"order and essence of the legend as originally told, only emphasising"
334,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"such points as are essential to the significance of the story, and"
335,WILLIAM MORRIS.,omitting or throwing into comparative shade those incidents which by
336,WILLIAM MORRIS.,their nature betray themselves to be arbitrary additions of later date.
337,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Wagner has chosen the former way, Morris the latter. This fact, and the"
338,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"divergent requirements of the drama and the epic, sufficiently account"
339,WILLIAM MORRIS.,for their difference of treatment. The leading idea in both cases
340,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"remains the same; it is the fatal curse which attaches to the gold or,"
341,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"which is the same in a moral sense, to the desire for gold--_auri sacra"
342,WILLIAM MORRIS.,fames_.
343,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
344,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"At first sight the tale of Sigurd, Fafnir's bane, seems to have little"
345,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"connection with this idea. It is briefly this. Sigurd, the son of"
346,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Sigmund the Volsung, is brought up at the court of King Elf, the second"
347,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"husband of his mother, after Sigmund has been slain in battle. With a"
348,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"sword, fashioned from the shards of his father's weapon, he slays"
349,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Fafnir, a huge worm or dragon, and possesses himself of the treasure"
350,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"watched by the monster, including a ring and the ""helm of aweing,"" the"
351,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"latter in the _Nibelungenlied_, converted into the ""Tarnkappe"", a magic"
352,WILLIAM MORRIS.,cap which makes the bearer invisible and endows him with supernatural
353,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"strength. Tasting of the blood of the dragon, he understands the"
354,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"language of birds, and an eagle tells him of a beautiful maiden lying"
355,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"asleep on a rock called Hindfell, surrounded by a wall of wavering fire."
356,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Through it Sigurd rides and awakes Brynhild the sword maiden, or"
357,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Valkyrie, from her magic slumber. Love naturally follows. The pair live"
358,WILLIAM MORRIS.,together on Hindfell for a season and Brynhild teaches the youth the
359,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"runes of her wisdom, a conception of woman's refining and civilising"
360,WILLIAM MORRIS.,mission frequently met with in old Germanic tales. When Sigurd leaves
361,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"her to seek new adventures they plight the troth of eternal love, and"
362,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
363,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Then he set the ring on her finger, and once if ne'er again"
364,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"They kissed and clung together, and their hearts were full and fain."
365,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
366,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"From Brynhild's rock Sigurd journeys to a realm ""south of the Rhine"""
367,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"where dwell the kingly brothers, Gunnar, Hogni, and Guttorm, the"
368,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Niblungs, together with their sister Gudrun, ""the fairest of maidens"","
369,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"and their mother Grimhild, ""a wise wife"" and a fierce-hearted woman, as"
370,WILLIAM MORRIS.,the Volsunga Saga alternately describes her. It is through a
371,WILLIAM MORRIS.,love-philter brewed by her that Sigurd forgets the vows exchanged with
372,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Brynhild, and becomes enamoured of Gudrun, whom he soon after weds. So"
373,WILLIAM MORRIS.,powerful is the charm that the very name of his former love has been
374,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"wiped from Sigurd's memory, and he willingly undertakes the task to woo"
375,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"and win Brynhild for his brother Gunnar. For that purpose he, by means"
376,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"of his magic cap, assumes Gunnar's semblance, and after having once"
377,WILLIAM MORRIS.,more crossed the wall of wavering flame compels Brynhild to become his
378,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"bride. But, faithful to his promise, he places a drawn sword between"
379,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"himself and the maid ""as they lie on one bed together."" On parting from"
380,WILLIAM MORRIS.,her he receives back from Brynhild his own ring given to her at Hindfell
381,WILLIAM MORRIS.,in the days of their bliss. Sigurd then returns to Gunnar and resumes
382,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"his own form, and all return home, the King leading his unwilling bride"
383,WILLIAM MORRIS.,in triumph.
384,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
385,WILLIAM MORRIS.,The subsequent events are the outgrowth of the tragic guilt thus
386,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"incurred. Sigurd reveals the secret of Brynhild's wooing to his wife,"
387,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"and allows her to take possession of the fatal ring, which she during a"
388,WILLIAM MORRIS.,quarrel shows to Gunnar's wife. Brynhild thus informed of the fraud
389,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"practised on her, thinks of vengeance, and incites her husband and his"
390,WILLIAM MORRIS.,brothers to kill Sigurd. The deed is done while Sigurd lies asleep in
391,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"his chamber with Gudrun, or, according to the more poetic version of the"
392,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"German epic, while he bends over a brook in the forest to quench his"
393,WILLIAM MORRIS.,thirst after a day's hunting. But as soon as her beloved foe is killed
394,WILLIAM MORRIS.,the old passion never quenched rises up again in Brynhild's heart. To be
395,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"united with her lover in death she pierces her breast with a sword, and"
396,WILLIAM MORRIS.,one pyre consumes both.
397,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
398,WILLIAM MORRIS.,With this climax Wagner very properly concludes his drama. But the epic
399,WILLIAM MORRIS.,poet likes to follow the course of events to their ultimate
400,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"consequences, and Morris, in accordance with the Volsunga Saga, proceeds"
401,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"to relate how, after many years of mournful widowhood, Gudrun is married"
402,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"to Atli, a mighty king, the brother of Brynhild. Eager to become"
403,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"possessed of Sigurd's treasure he invites the Niblungs, its actual"
404,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"owners, to his country, and there the kingly brothers and all their"
405,WILLIAM MORRIS.,followers are killed by base treachery and after the most heroic
406,WILLIAM MORRIS.,resistance. They refuse sternly to ransom their lives by a discovery of
407,WILLIAM MORRIS.,the hoard which previous to their departure they have hidden at the
408,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"bottom of a lake, and which thus is irrecoverably lost to mankind."
409,WILLIAM MORRIS.,Gudrun has incited her husband to the deed and has looked on calmly
410,WILLIAM MORRIS.,while her kinsmen were slain one after the other. But when all are dead
411,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"and the murder of Sigurd has been revenged, the feeling of blood"
412,WILLIAM MORRIS.,relationship so powerful among Northern nations is reawakened in her.
413,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"While Atli and his earls are asleep she sets fire to the kingly hall,"
414,WILLIAM MORRIS.,and her wretched husband falls by her own hand. It is characteristic of
415,WILLIAM MORRIS.,the Icelandic epic that after all these fates and horrors Gudrun lives
416,WILLIAM MORRIS.,for a number of years and is yet again married to a third husband. But
417,WILLIAM MORRIS.,to this length even Morris refuses to accompany the tale. In accordance
418,WILLIAM MORRIS.,with the Volsunga Saga his Gudrun throws herself into the sea; but the
419,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"waves do not carry her ""to the burg of king Imakr, a mighty king and"
420,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"lord of many folk."""
421,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
422,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"All this is very grand and weird, the reader will say, but where is the"
423,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"moral, the ideal essence of which these events are but the earthly"
424,WILLIAM MORRIS.,reflex? To this essence we gradually ascend by inquiring into the
425,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"mythological sources of the tale, by asking who is Sigurd, whence does"
426,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"he come, on what mission is he sent and by whom? also what is the"
427,WILLIAM MORRIS.,significance of the treasure watched by a dragon and coveted by all
428,WILLIAM MORRIS.,mankind? This treasure we then shall find and the curse attaching to it
429,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"ever since it was robbed from Andvari, the water-elf, is the keynote of"
430,WILLIAM MORRIS.,the whole story. The curse proves fatal to all its successive owners
431,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"from Andvari himself and Fafnir, who, for its sake, kills his father,"
432,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"down to Sigurd and Brynhild and the Niblung brothers. Nay, Odin himself,"
433,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"the supreme God, becomes subject to the curse of the gold through having"
434,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"once coveted it, and we dimly discern that the ultimate doom of the"
435,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Aesir, the Ragnarök, or dusk of the Gods, of which the Voluspa speaks,"
436,WILLIAM MORRIS.,is intimately connected with the same baneful influence. It further
437,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"becomes evident that Sigurd the Volsung, the descendant of Odin, is"
438,WILLIAM MORRIS.,destined to wrest the treasure and the power derived from it from the
439,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Niblungs, the dark or cloudy people who threaten the bright godworld of"
440,WILLIAM MORRIS.,Valhall with destruction. And this leads us back to a still earlier
441,WILLIAM MORRIS.,stage of the myth in which Sigurd himself becomes the symbol of the
442,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"celestial luminary conquering night and misty darkness, an idea"
443,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"repeatedly hinted at by Morris and splendidly illustrated by Wagner,"
444,WILLIAM MORRIS.,when Siegfried appears on the stage illumined by the first rays of the
445,WILLIAM MORRIS.,rising sun. In the work of the German poet all this is brought out with
446,WILLIAM MORRIS.,a distinctness of which only dramatic genius of the highest order is
447,WILLIAM MORRIS.,capable. With an astounding grasp of detail and with a continuity of
448,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"thought rarely equalled, Wagner has remoulded the confused and complex"
449,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"argument of the old tale, omitting what seemed unnecessary, and placing"
450,WILLIAM MORRIS.,in juxtaposition incidents organically connected but separated by the
451,WILLIAM MORRIS.,obtuseness of later sagamen.
452,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
453,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Morris, as has been said before, proceeds on a different principle. His"
454,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"first object is to tell a tale, and to tell it as nearly as possible in"
455,WILLIAM MORRIS.,the spirit and according to the letter of the old Sagas. In this he has
456,WILLIAM MORRIS.,succeeded in a manner at once indicative of his high poetic gifts and of
457,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"a deep sympathy with the spirit of the Northern Myth, which breathes in"
458,WILLIAM MORRIS.,every line and in every turn of his phraseology. To compare the peculiar
459,WILLIAM MORRIS.,tinge of his language with the ordinary archaisms and euphonisms of
460,WILLIAM MORRIS.,literary poets would be mistaking a field flower for its counterpart in
461,WILLIAM MORRIS.,a milliner's shop window. It is true that he also hints at the larger
462,WILLIAM MORRIS.,philosophic and moral issues of the tale. But when he refers to the end
463,WILLIAM MORRIS.,of the gods brought about by their own guilt or to the redeeming mission
464,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"of Sigurd, it is done in the mysterious, not to say half conscious"
465,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"manner of the saga itself, and the effect is such as from his own point"
466,WILLIAM MORRIS.,of view he intended it and could not but intend it to be.
467,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
468,WILLIAM MORRIS.,Between the publication of _The Defence of Guenevere_ and that of Jason
469,WILLIAM MORRIS.,ten years elapsed. During most of this time the poet was employed in
470,WILLIAM MORRIS.,artistic pursuits. In 1861 he started in conjunction with a number of
471,WILLIAM MORRIS.,friends the business of decorator and artistic designer which still
472,WILLIAM MORRIS.,bears his name. Growing from very modest beginnings this enterprise was
473,WILLIAM MORRIS.,destined to work an entire change in the external aspect of English
474,WILLIAM MORRIS.,homes. It soon extended its activity to every branch of art-workmanship.
475,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"D. G. Rossetti, Madox Brown, and Burne Jones drew cartoons for the"
476,WILLIAM MORRIS.,stained glass windows to be seen in many of our churches and colleges.
477,WILLIAM MORRIS.,Morris himself designed wall-papers and the patterns of carpets. The
478,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"latter are woven on hand-looms in his factory at Merton Abbey, which"
479,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"stands on the banks of the river Wandle surrounded by orchards, and"
480,WILLIAM MORRIS.,looks as like a medieval workshop as the modern dresses of the workgirls
481,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"will allow. Another member of the firm, Philip Webb, was the first"
482,WILLIAM MORRIS.,modern architect to build houses of red brick in the style vaguely and
483,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"not quite correctly described as ""Queen Anne."" At present these houses"
484,WILLIAM MORRIS.,count by thousands in London and a whole village of them has been built
485,WILLIAM MORRIS.,at Turnham Green. The members of the firm did not confine their
486,WILLIAM MORRIS.,attention to any particular style or age or country. Wherever beautiful
487,WILLIAM MORRIS.,things could be found they collected them and made them popular. Old
488,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"china English, and foreign, Japanese fans and screens, Venetian glass"
489,WILLIAM MORRIS.,and German pottery were equally welcome to them and through them to the
490,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"public generally. It may be said that the ""aesthetic"" fashion as it came"
491,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"to be called will like other fashions die out, and that people in the"
492,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"course of time will grow tired of ""living up to"" their furniture and"
493,WILLIAM MORRIS.,dresses. At the same time the idea thus insisted upon that beauty is an
494,WILLIAM MORRIS.,essential and necessary ingredient of practical modern English life is
495,WILLIAM MORRIS.,not likely to be without beneficial and permanent effect.
496,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
497,WILLIAM MORRIS.,It was as artistic worker and employer of skilled labour that Morris
498,WILLIAM MORRIS.,imbibed that profound disgust with our social condition which induced
499,WILLIAM MORRIS.,him to adopt the principles of extreme socialism. For a long time his
500,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"views had tended in that direction, and at the end of 1884 he joined the"
501,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Socialist League, a body professing the doctrines of international"
502,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"revolutionary socialism. He is the editor of its official organ, the"
503,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"_Commonweal_, which contains many contributions from his pen both in"
504,WILLIAM MORRIS.,prose and verse. That the poet has not been entirely sunk in the
505,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"politician, that longing for beauty is at least the partial cause of"
506,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"this desire for change at any price, is however proved by such a"
507,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"sentiment as, ""Beauty, which is what is meant by _art_, using the word"
508,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"in its widest sense, is, I contend, no mere accident of human life which"
509,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"people can take or have as they choose, but a positive necessity of"
510,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"life, if we are to live as nature meant us to, that is unless we are"
511,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"content to be less than men,"" or by such a vision of a future earthly"
512,WILLIAM MORRIS.,paradise as is expressed in the following lines:
513,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
514,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Then a man shall work and bethink him, and rejoice in the deeds of his"
515,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"hand,"
516,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Nor yet come home in the even, too faint and weary to stand,"
517,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
518,WILLIAM MORRIS.,.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
519,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
520,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"For that which the worker winneth shall then be his indeed,"
521,WILLIAM MORRIS.,Nor shall half be reaped for nothing by him that sowed no seed.
522,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
523,WILLIAM MORRIS.,.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
524,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
525,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Then all _mine_ and _thine_ shall be _ours_, and no more shall any man"
526,WILLIAM MORRIS.,crave
527,WILLIAM MORRIS.,For riches that serve for nothing but to fetter a friend for a slave.
528,WILLIAM MORRIS.,
529,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"One may admire the pathetic beauty of such lines, without sharing the"
530,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"poet's hope, that their import will ever be realised, in a world peopled"
531,WILLIAM MORRIS.,by men and not by angels. History teaches and personal experience
532,WILLIAM MORRIS.,confirms that art enjoyment and art creation of the highest type must be
533,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"confined to the few, and it is to be feared that social democracy,"
534,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"whatever it may do for the physical welfare of the many, will care"
535,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"little about beauty, either in nature or in art. The _Demos_ will never"
536,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"admire Rossetti's pictures or Keats's poetry, and the first thing the"
537,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"much-vaunted peasant proprietors, or peasant communes would do would be"
538,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"to cut down our ancient trees, level every hedgerow and turn parks and"
539,WILLIAM MORRIS.,commons into potato plots or it may be turnip fields. One may feel
540,WILLIAM MORRIS.,certain of all this and yet admire the author of _The Earthly
541,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"Paradise_, ""the idle singer of an empty day"" when he preaches universal"
542,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"brotherhood in the crossways of Hammersmith, and wrestles with"
543,WILLIAM MORRIS.,"policemen, or wrangles with obtuse magistrates about the freedom of"
544,WILLIAM MORRIS.,speech. Conviction thus upheld at the cost of worldly advantage and
545,WILLIAM MORRIS.,personal convenience and taste must command respect even from those who
546,WILLIAM MORRIS.,cannot share it.

1080,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON.,"My lady's face with long red hair,"
1081,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON.,"Pale, ivory-colour'd dear face come,"

1085,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON.,To leave me by myself again;
1086,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON.,Could I get this by longing: vain!
1087,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON.,
1088,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON.,The castellan is gone: I see
1089,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON.,On one broad yellow flower a bee
1090,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON.,Drunk with much honey--
1091,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON.,"Christ! again,"
1092,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON.,"Some distant knight's voice brings me pain,"
1093,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON.,"I thought I had forgot to feel,"

1148,SIR LAUNCELOT.,SIR GUY _sayeth afterwards_.
1149,SIR LAUNCELOT.,
1150,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"I said, I go to meet her now,"
1151,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"And saying so, I felt a blow"
1152,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"From some clench'd hand across my brow,"
1153,SIR LAUNCELOT.,And fell down on the sunflowers
1154,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"Just as a hammering smote my ears,"
1155,SIR LAUNCELOT.,After which this I felt in sooth;
1156,SIR LAUNCELOT.,My bare hands throttling without ruth
1157,SIR LAUNCELOT.,The hairy-throated castellan;
1158,SIR LAUNCELOT.,Then a grim fight with those that ran
1159,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"To slay me, while I shouted, ""God"
1160,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"For the Lady Mary!"" deep I trod"
1161,SIR LAUNCELOT.,That evening in my own red blood;
1162,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"Nevertheless so stiff I stood,"
1163,SIR LAUNCELOT.,That when the knights burst the old wood

1165,SIR LAUNCELOT.,
1166,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"I kiss the Lady Mary's head,"

1174,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,
1175,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,
1176,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,There were four of us about that bed;
1177,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"The mass-priest knelt at the side,"

1183,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"He did not die in the night,"
1184,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"He did not die in the day,"
1185,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,But in the morning twilight
1186,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"His spirit pass'd away,"
1187,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"When neither sun nor moon was bright,"
1188,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,And the trees were merely grey.
1189,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,
1190,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"He was not slain with the sword,"
1191,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"Knight's axe, or the knightly spear,"
1192,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,Yet spoke he never a word
1193,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,After he came in here;
1194,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,I cut away the cord
1195,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,From the neck of my brother dear.
1196,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,
1197,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"He did not strike one blow,"
1198,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"For the recreants came behind,"
1199,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"In a place where the hornbeams grow,"
1200,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"A path right hard to find,"
1201,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"For the hornbeam boughs swing so,"
1202,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,That the twilight makes it blind.
1203,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,
1204,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"They lighted a great torch then,"

1211,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"I am threescore and ten,"

1213,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,But I met Sir John of the Fen
1214,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"Long ago on a summer day,"
1215,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,And am glad to think of the moment when
1216,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,I took his life away.
1217,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,
1218,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"I am threescore and ten,"
1219,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"And my strength is mostly pass'd,"
1220,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"But long ago I and my men,"
1221,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"When the sky was overcast,"
1222,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"And the smoke roll'd over the reeds of the fen,"
1223,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,Slew Guy of the Dolorous Blast.
1224,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,
1225,SHAMEFUL DEATH.,"And now, knights all of you,"

1265,THE EVE OF CRECY.,
1266,THE EVE OF CRECY.,"Yet even now it is good to think,"

1270,THE EVE OF CRECY.,

1342,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS.,"For when they near'd that old soak'd hay,"

1466,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS.,"Held out, she stood and gazed, and saw,"
1467,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS.,The long bright blade without a flaw
1468,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS.,"Glide out from Godmar's sheath, his hand"
1469,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS.,In Robert's hair; she saw him bend
1470,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS.,Back Robert's head; she saw him send
1471,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS.,"The thin steel down; the blow told well,"
1472,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS.,"Right backward the knight Robert fell,"
1473,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS.,"And moan'd as dogs do, being half dead,"
1474,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS.,"Unwitting, as I deem: so then"
1475,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS.,"Godmar turn'd grinning to his men,"
1476,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS.,"Who ran, some five or six, and beat"
1477,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS.,His head to pieces at their feet.
1478,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS.,
1479,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS.,Then Godmar turn'd again and said:

1617,BOOK XIV.,The orange-scented land-breeze seemed to bear
1618,BOOK XIV.,Some other sounds unto the listening ear

1628,BOOK XIV.,"Now, as they sped along, they presently,"

1661,BOOK XIV.,Silent with glittering eyes the Minyæ

1670,BOOK XIV.,"But their own bodies, fair beyond man's thought,"
1671,BOOK XIV.,"Under the grey cliff, hidden not of aught"

1674,BOOK XIV.,"A moment Jason gazed, then through the waist"

1680,BOOK XIV.,"But as he staggered forward, Jason's hand"
1681,BOOK XIV.,"Hard on the tiller steered away from land,"
1682,BOOK XIV.,And as her head a little now fell off
1683,BOOK XIV.,"Unto the wide sea, did he shout this scoff"
1684,BOOK XIV.,"To Thracian Orpheus: ""Minstrel, shall we die,"

1698,BOOK XIV.,But as his well-skilled hands were preluding
1699,BOOK XIV.,"What his heart swelled with, they began to sing"
1700,BOOK XIV.,"With pleading voices from the yellow sands,"
1701,BOOK XIV.,"Clustered together, with appealing hands"
1702,BOOK XIV.,"Reached out to Argo as the great sail drew,"
1703,BOOK XIV.,"While o'er their white limbs sharp the spray-shower flew,"
1704,BOOK XIV.,Since they spared not to set white feet among
1705,BOOK XIV.,The cold waves heedless of their honied song.
1706,BOOK XIV.,"Sweetly they sang, and still the answer came"

1861,ORPHEUS.,"Then, when the world is born again,"

1865,ORPHEUS.,
1866,THE SIRENS.,THE SIRENS.
1867,THE SIRENS.,
1868,THE SIRENS.,Ah! then the world is born again
1869,THE SIRENS.,"With burning love unsatisfied,"
1870,THE SIRENS.,"And new desires fond and vain,"
1871,THE SIRENS.,And weary days from tide to tide.
1872,THE SIRENS.,
1873,THE SIRENS.,"Ah! when the world is born again,"
1874,THE SIRENS.,"A little day is soon gone by,"
1875,THE SIRENS.,"When thou, unmoved by sun or rain,"

1877,THE SIRENS.,
1878,THE SIRENS.,"Therewith they ceased awhile, as languidly"
1879,THE SIRENS.,"The head of Argo fell off toward the sea,"
1880,THE SIRENS.,"And through the water she began to go,"
1881,THE SIRENS.,"For from the land a fitful wind did blow,"
1882,THE SIRENS.,"That, dallying with the many-coloured sail,"
1883,THE SIRENS.,"Would sometimes swell it out and sometimes fail,"

1955,THE SIRENS.,"Such bodies garlanded with gold,"

2029,ORPHEUS.,Came o'er the bitter sea and cold;
2030,ORPHEUS.,"And surely those that met me there,"

2072,ORPHEUS.,"For shadowy and dull hopelessness,"

2074,ORPHEUS.,"Than far from this grey light to lie,"

2120,ORPHEUS.,
2121,ORPHEUS.,"In such wise sang the Thracian, in such wise"
2122,ORPHEUS.,Out gushed the Sirens' deadly melodies;
2123,ORPHEUS.,"But long before the mingled song was done,"
2124,ORPHEUS.,"Back to the oars the Minyæ, one by one,"
2125,ORPHEUS.,"Slunk silently; though many an one sighed sore,"
2126,ORPHEUS.,"As his strong fingers met the wood once more,"
2127,ORPHEUS.,And from his breast the toilsome breathing came.
2128,ORPHEUS.,"But as they laboured, some for very shame"
2129,ORPHEUS.,"Hung down their heads, and yet amongst them some"
2130,ORPHEUS.,Gazed at the place whence that sweet song had come;
2131,ORPHEUS.,But round the oars and Argo's shielded side
2132,ORPHEUS.,"The sea grew white, and she began to glide"
2133,ORPHEUS.,Swift through the waters of that deadly bay;
2134,ORPHEUS.,"But when a long wake now behind her lay,"
2135,ORPHEUS.,"And still the whistle of the wind increased,"
2136,ORPHEUS.,"Past shroud and mast, and all the song had ceased,"
2137,ORPHEUS.,"Butes rose up, the fair Athenian man,"
2138,ORPHEUS.,And with wild eyes betwixt the rowers ran
2139,ORPHEUS.,Unto the poop and leapt into the sea;
2140,ORPHEUS.,"Then all men rested on their oars, but he"
2141,ORPHEUS.,"Rose to the top, and towards the shore swam fast;"
2142,ORPHEUS.,"While all eyes watched him, who had well-nigh past"
2143,ORPHEUS.,The place where sand and water 'gan to meet
2144,ORPHEUS.,"In wreaths and ripples round the ivory feet,"
2145,ORPHEUS.,"When sun-burnt swimmer, snow-white glancing limb,"
2146,ORPHEUS.,"And yellow sand unto their eyes grew dim,"
2147,ORPHEUS.,Nor did they see their fellow any more.
2148,ORPHEUS.,But when they once again beheld the shore
2149,ORPHEUS.,"The wind sung o'er the empty beach and bare,"
2150,ORPHEUS.,And by the cliff uprose into the air
2151,ORPHEUS.,"A delicate and glittering little cloud,"
2152,ORPHEUS.,That seemed some many-coloured sun to shroud;
2153,ORPHEUS.,But as the rugged cliff it drew above
2154,ORPHEUS.,The wondering Minyæ beheld it move
2155,ORPHEUS.,"Westward, toward Lilybæum and the sun."
2156,ORPHEUS.,"Then once more was their seaward course begun,"
2157,ORPHEUS.,"And soon those deadly sands were far astern,"
2158,ORPHEUS.,Nor ever after could the heroes learn
2159,ORPHEUS.,If Butes lived or died; but old tales tell
2160,ORPHEUS.,"That while the tumbling waves he breasted well,"
2161,ORPHEUS.,"Venus beheld him, as unseen she drew"
2162,ORPHEUS.,From sunny Cyprus to the headland blue
2163,ORPHEUS.,"Of Lilybæum, where her temple is;"
2164,ORPHEUS.,"She, with a mind his sun-burnt brows to kiss,"
2165,ORPHEUS.,"E'en as his feet were dropping nigh the beach,"
2166,ORPHEUS.,"And ere his hand the deadly hands could reach,"
2167,ORPHEUS.,"Stooped, as the merlin stoops upon the dove,"
2168,ORPHEUS.,"And snatched him thence to be awhile her love,"
2169,ORPHEUS.,"Betwixt the golden pillars of her shrine,"
2170,ORPHEUS.,That those who pass the Ægades see shine
2171,ORPHEUS.,From high-raised Lilybæum o'er the sea.
2172,ORPHEUS.,
2173,ORPHEUS.,But far away the sea-beat Minyæ
2174,ORPHEUS.,"Cast forth the foam, as through the growing night"
2175,ORPHEUS.,"They laboured ever, having small delight"
2176,ORPHEUS.,"In life all empty of that promised bliss,"
2177,ORPHEUS.,"In love that scarce can give a dying kiss,"
2178,ORPHEUS.,"In pleasure ending sweet songs with a wail,"
2179,ORPHEUS.,"In fame that little can dead men avail,"
2180,ORPHEUS.,"In vain toil struggling with the fateful stream,"
2181,ORPHEUS.,"In hope, the promise of a morning dream."
2182,ORPHEUS.,"Yet as night died, and the cold sea and grey"
2183,ORPHEUS.,"Seemed running with them toward the dawn of day,"
2184,ORPHEUS.,"Needs must they once again forget their death,"
2185,ORPHEUS.,"Needs must they, being alive and drawing breath,"
2186,ORPHEUS.,As men who of no other life can know
2187,ORPHEUS.,In their own minds again immortal grow.
2188,ORPHEUS.,"But toward the south a little now they bent,"
2189,ORPHEUS.,"And for a while o'er landless sea they went,"
2190,ORPHEUS.,But on the third day made another land
2191,ORPHEUS.,"At dawn of day, and thitherward did stand;"
2192,ORPHEUS.,"And since the wind blew lightly from the shore,"
2193,ORPHEUS.,"Somewhat abeam, they feared not with the oar"
2194,ORPHEUS.,"To push across the shallowing sea and green,"
2195,ORPHEUS.,"That washed a land the fairest they had seen,"
2196,ORPHEUS.,Whose shell-strewn beach at highest of the tide
2197,ORPHEUS.,"'Twixt sea and flowery shore was nowise wide,"
2198,ORPHEUS.,And drawn a little backward from the sea
2199,ORPHEUS.,"There stood a marble wall wrought cunningly,"
2200,ORPHEUS.,"Rosy and white, set thick with images,"
2201,ORPHEUS.,"And over-topped with heavy-fruited trees,"
2202,ORPHEUS.,"Which by the shore ran, as the bay did bend,"
2203,ORPHEUS.,And to their eyes had neither gap nor end;
2204,ORPHEUS.,"Nor any gate: and looking over this,"
2205,ORPHEUS.,"They saw a place not made for earthly bliss,"
2206,ORPHEUS.,"Or eyes of dying men, for growing there"
2207,ORPHEUS.,"The yellow apple and the painted pear,"
2208,ORPHEUS.,And well-filled golden cups of oranges
2209,ORPHEUS.,Hung amid groves of pointed cypress trees;
2210,ORPHEUS.,"On grassy slopes the twining vine-boughs grew,"
2211,ORPHEUS.,"And hoary olives 'twixt far mountains blue,"
2212,ORPHEUS.,"And many-coloured flowers, like as a cloud"
2213,ORPHEUS.,The rugged southern cliffs did softly shroud;
2214,ORPHEUS.,And many a green-necked bird sung to his mate
2215,ORPHEUS.,"Within the slim-leaved, thorny pomegranate,"
2216,ORPHEUS.,"That flung its unstrung rubies on the grass,"
2217,ORPHEUS.,And slowly o'er the place the wind did pass
2218,ORPHEUS.,Heavy with many odours that it bore
2219,ORPHEUS.,"From thymy hills down to the sea-beat shore,"
2220,ORPHEUS.,"Because no flower there is, that all the year,"
2221,ORPHEUS.,"From spring to autumn, beareth otherwhere,"
2222,ORPHEUS.,But there it flourished; nor the fruit alone
2223,ORPHEUS.,"From 'twixt the green leaves and the boughs outshone,"
2224,ORPHEUS.,For there each tree was ever flowering.
2225,ORPHEUS.,Nor was there lacking many a living thing
2226,ORPHEUS.,Changed of its nature; for the roebuck there
2227,ORPHEUS.,Walked fearless with the tiger; and the bear
2228,ORPHEUS.,"Rolled sleepily upon the fruit-strawn grass,"
2229,ORPHEUS.,"Letting the conies o'er his rough hide pass,"
2230,ORPHEUS.,"With blinking eyes, that meant no treachery."
2231,ORPHEUS.,Careless the partridge passed the red fox by;
2232,ORPHEUS.,"Untouched the serpent left the thrushes brown,"
2233,ORPHEUS.,And as a picture was the lion's frown.
2234,ORPHEUS.,"But in the midst there was a grassy space,"
2235,ORPHEUS.,"Raised somewhat over all the flowery place,"
2236,ORPHEUS.,On marble terrace-walls wrought like a dream;
2237,ORPHEUS.,"And round about it ran a clear blue stream,"
2238,ORPHEUS.,"Bridged o'er with marble steps, and midmost there"
2239,ORPHEUS.,"Grew a green tree, whose smooth grey boughs did bear"
2240,ORPHEUS.,"Such fruit as never man elsewhere had seen,"
2241,ORPHEUS.,For 'twixt the sunlight and the shadow green
2242,ORPHEUS.,Shone out fair apples of red gleaming gold.
2243,ORPHEUS.,"Moreover round the tree, in many a fold,"
2244,ORPHEUS.,"Lay coiled a dragon, glittering little less"
2245,ORPHEUS.,Than that which his eternal watchfulness
2246,ORPHEUS.,"Was set to guard; nor yet was he alone,"
2247,ORPHEUS.,For from the daisied grass about him shone
2248,ORPHEUS.,"Gold raiment wrapping round two damsels fair,"
2249,ORPHEUS.,"And one upon the steps combed out her hair,"
2250,ORPHEUS.,And with shut eyes sung low as in a dream;
2251,ORPHEUS.,"And one stood naked in the cold blue stream,"
2252,ORPHEUS.,While on the bank her golden raiment lay;
2253,ORPHEUS.,"But on that noontide of the quivering day,"
2254,ORPHEUS.,"She only, hearing the seafarers' shout,"
2255,ORPHEUS.,"Her lovely golden head had turned about,"
2256,ORPHEUS.,"And seen their white sail flapping o'er the wall,"
2257,ORPHEUS.,"And as she turned had let her tresses fall,"
2258,ORPHEUS.,Which the thin water rippling round her knee
2259,ORPHEUS.,Bore outward from her toward the restless sea.
2260,ORPHEUS.,"Not long she stood, but looking seaward yet,"
2261,ORPHEUS.,"From out the water made good haste to get,"
2262,ORPHEUS.,"And catching up her raiment hastily,"
2263,ORPHEUS.,"Ran up the marble stair, and 'gan to cry:"
2264,ORPHEUS.,"""Wake, O my sisters, wake, for now are come"
2265,ORPHEUS.,"The thieves of Æa to our peaceful home."""
2266,ORPHEUS.,"Then at her voice they gat them to their feet,"
2267,ORPHEUS.,And when her raiment all her body sweet
2268,ORPHEUS.,"Once more had hidden, joining hand to hand,"
2269,ORPHEUS.,"About the sacred apples did they stand,"
2270,ORPHEUS.,"While coiled the dragon closer to the tree,"
2271,ORPHEUS.,And raised his head above them threateningly.
2272,ORPHEUS.,
2273,ORPHEUS.,"Meanwhile, from Argo many a sea-beat face"
2274,ORPHEUS.,"Gazed longingly upon that lovely place,"
2275,ORPHEUS.,And some their eager hands already laid
2276,ORPHEUS.,Upon the gangway. Then Medea said:--
2277,ORPHEUS.,"""Get back unto the oars, O Minyæ,"
2278,ORPHEUS.,"Nor loiter here, for what have such as we"
2279,ORPHEUS.,"To do herein, where, 'mid undying trees,"
2280,ORPHEUS.,"Undying watch the wise Hesperides,"
2281,ORPHEUS.,"And where the while they watch, scarce can a God"
2282,ORPHEUS.,Set foot upon the fruit-besprinkled sod
2283,ORPHEUS.,"That no snow ever covers? therefore haste,"
2284,ORPHEUS.,Nor yet in wondering your fair lives waste;
2285,ORPHEUS.,"For these are as the Gods, nor think of us,"
2286,ORPHEUS.,Nor to their eyes can aught be glorious
2287,ORPHEUS.,That son of man can do; would God that I
2288,ORPHEUS.,"Could see far off the misty headland lie,"
2289,ORPHEUS.,"Where we the guilt of blood shall wash away,"
2290,ORPHEUS.,"For I grow weary of the dashing spray,"
2291,ORPHEUS.,"And ceaseless roll of interwoven seas,"
2292,ORPHEUS.,And fain were sitting 'neath the whispering trees
2293,ORPHEUS.,"In homely places, where the children play,"
2294,ORPHEUS.,"Who change like me, grow old, and die some day."""
2295,ORPHEUS.,"She ceased, and little soothly did they grieve,"
2296,ORPHEUS.,"For all its loveliness, that land to leave,"
2297,ORPHEUS.,"For now some God had chilled their hardihead,"
2298,ORPHEUS.,"And in their hearts had set a sacred dread,"
2299,ORPHEUS.,"They knew not why; but on their oars they hung,"
2300,ORPHEUS.,A little longer as the sisters sung.
2301,ORPHEUS.,
2302,ORPHEUS.,"""O ye, who to this place have strayed,"
2303,ORPHEUS.,"That never for man's eyes was made,"
2304,ORPHEUS.,"Depart in haste, as ye have come,"
2305,ORPHEUS.,And bear back to your sea-beat home
2306,ORPHEUS.,"This memory of the age of gold,"
2307,ORPHEUS.,"And for your eyes, grown over-bold,"
2308,ORPHEUS.,"Your hearts shall pay in sorrowing,"
2309,ORPHEUS.,For want of many a half-seen thing.
2310,ORPHEUS.,
2311,ORPHEUS.,"""Lo, such as is this garden green,"
2312,ORPHEUS.,"In days past, all the world has been,"
2313,ORPHEUS.,"And what we know all people knew,"
2314,ORPHEUS.,"Save this, that unto worse all grew."
2315,ORPHEUS.,"""But since the golden age is gone,"
2316,ORPHEUS.,"This little place is left alone,"
2317,ORPHEUS.,"Unchanged, unchanging, watched of us,"
2318,ORPHEUS.,The daughters of wise Hesperus.
2319,ORPHEUS.,"""Surely the heavenly Messenger"
2320,ORPHEUS.,"Full oft is fain to enter here,"
2321,ORPHEUS.,And yet without must he abide;
2322,ORPHEUS.,Nor longeth less the dark king's bride
2323,ORPHEUS.,To set red lips unto that fruit
2324,ORPHEUS.,That erst made nought her mother's suit.
2325,ORPHEUS.,"Here would Diana rest awhile,"
2326,ORPHEUS.,"Forgetful of her woodland guile,"
2327,ORPHEUS.,Among these beasts that fear her nought.
2328,ORPHEUS.,"Nor is it less in Pallas' thought,"
2329,ORPHEUS.,Beneath our trees to ponder o'er
2330,ORPHEUS.,"The wide, unfathomed sea of lore;"
2331,ORPHEUS.,"And oft-kissed Citheræa, no less"
2332,ORPHEUS.,"Weary of love, full fain would press"
2333,ORPHEUS.,These flowers with soft unsandalled feet.
2334,ORPHEUS.,
2335,ORPHEUS.,"""But unto us our rest is sweet,"
2336,ORPHEUS.,Neither shall any man or God
2337,ORPHEUS.,Or lovely Goddess touch the sod
2338,ORPHEUS.,"Where-under old times buried lie,"
2339,ORPHEUS.,Before the world knew misery.
2340,ORPHEUS.,"Nor will we have a slave or king,"
2341,ORPHEUS.,Nor yet will we learn anything
2342,ORPHEUS.,"But that we know, that makes us glad;"
2343,ORPHEUS.,While oft the very Gods are sad
2344,ORPHEUS.,With knowing what the Fates shall do.
2345,ORPHEUS.,"""Neither from us shall wisdom go"
2346,ORPHEUS.,"To fill the hungering hearts of men,"
2347,ORPHEUS.,Lest to them threescore years and ten
2348,ORPHEUS.,"Come but to seem a little day,"
2349,ORPHEUS.,"Once given, and taken soon away."
2350,ORPHEUS.,"Nay, rather let them find their life"
2351,ORPHEUS.,"Bitter and sweet, fulfilled of strife,"
2352,ORPHEUS.,"Restless with hope, vain with regret,"
2353,ORPHEUS.,"Trembling with fear, most strangely set"
2354,ORPHEUS.,'Twixt memory and forgetfulness;
2355,ORPHEUS.,"So more shall joy be, troubles less,"
2356,ORPHEUS.,"And surely when all this is past,"
2357,ORPHEUS.,They shall not want their rest at last.
2358,ORPHEUS.,
2359,ORPHEUS.,"""Let earth and heaven go on their way,"
2360,ORPHEUS.,"While still we watch from day to day,"
2361,ORPHEUS.,"In this green place left all alone,"
2362,ORPHEUS.,"A remnant of the days long gone."""
2363,ORPHEUS.,
2364,ORPHEUS.,"There in the wind they hung, as word by word"
2365,ORPHEUS.,The clear-voiced singers silently they heard;
2366,ORPHEUS.,"But when the air was barren of their song,"
2367,ORPHEUS.,"Anigh the shore they durst not linger long,"
2368,ORPHEUS.,"So northward turned forewearied Argo's head,"
2369,ORPHEUS.,"And dipping oars, from that fair country sped,"
2370,ORPHEUS.,"Fulfilled of new desires and pensive thought,"
2371,ORPHEUS.,Which that day's life unto their hearts had brought.
2372,ORPHEUS.,"Then hard they toiled upon the bitter sea,"
2373,ORPHEUS.,And in two days they did not fail to be
2374,ORPHEUS.,"In sight of land, a headland high and blue"
2375,ORPHEUS.,Which straight Milesian Erginus knew
2376,ORPHEUS.,"To be the fateful place which now they sought,"
2377,ORPHEUS.,"Stormy Malea, so thitherward they brought"
2378,ORPHEUS.,"The groaning ship, and, casting anchor, lay"
2379,ORPHEUS.,"Beneath that headland's lee, within a bay,"
2380,ORPHEUS.,"Wherefrom the more part landed, and their feet"
2381,ORPHEUS.,Once more the happy soil of Greece did meet.
2382,ORPHEUS.,Therewith they failèd not to bring ashore
2383,ORPHEUS.,"Rich robes of price and of fair arms good store,"
2384,ORPHEUS.,"And gold and silver, that they there might buy"
2385,ORPHEUS.,What yet they lacked for their solemnity;
2386,ORPHEUS.,"Then, while upon the highest point of land"
2387,ORPHEUS.,"Some built an altar, Jason, with a band"
2388,ORPHEUS.,"Of all the chiefest of the Minyæ,"
2389,ORPHEUS.,Turned inland from the murmur of the sea.
2390,ORPHEUS.,Not far they went ere by a little stream
2391,ORPHEUS.,Down in a valley they could see the gleam
2392,ORPHEUS.,"Of brazen pillars and fair-gilded vanes,"
2393,ORPHEUS.,"And, dropping down by dank dark-wooded lanes"
2394,ORPHEUS.,"From off the hill-side, reached a house at last"
2395,ORPHEUS.,"Where in and out men-slaves and women passed,"
2396,ORPHEUS.,"And guests were streaming fast into the hall,"
2397,ORPHEUS.,Where now the oaken boards were laid for all.
2398,ORPHEUS.,"With these the Minyæ went, and soon they were"
2399,ORPHEUS.,"Within a pillared hall both great and fair,"
2400,ORPHEUS.,"Where folk already sat beside the board,"
2401,ORPHEUS.,And on the dais was an ancient lord.
2402,ORPHEUS.,But when these saw the fearless Minyæ
2403,ORPHEUS.,"Glittering in arms, they sprang up hastily,"
2404,ORPHEUS.,And each man turned about unto the wall
2405,ORPHEUS.,To seize his spear or staff: then through the hall
2406,ORPHEUS.,"Jason cried out: ""Laconians, fear ye not,"
2407,ORPHEUS.,Nor leave the flesh-meat while it reeketh hot
2408,ORPHEUS.,"For dread of us, for we are men as ye,"
2409,ORPHEUS.,"And I am Jason of the Minyæ,"
2410,ORPHEUS.,"And come from Æa to the land of Greece,"
2411,ORPHEUS.,"And in my ship bear back the Golden Fleece,"
2412,ORPHEUS.,And a fair Colchian queen to fill my bed.
2413,ORPHEUS.,"And now we pray to share your wine and bread,"
2414,ORPHEUS.,"And other things we need, and at our hands"
2415,ORPHEUS.,"That ye will take fair things of many lands."""
2416,ORPHEUS.,"""Sirs,"" said the ancient lord, ""be welcome here,"
2417,ORPHEUS.,"Come up and sit by me, and make such cheer"
2418,ORPHEUS.,As here ye can: glad am I that to me
2419,ORPHEUS.,The first of Grecian men from off the sea
2420,ORPHEUS.,"Ye now are come."""
2421,ORPHEUS.,Therewith the great hall rang
2422,ORPHEUS.,"With joyful shouts, and as, with clash and clang"
2423,ORPHEUS.,"Of well-wrought arms, up to the dais they went,"
2424,ORPHEUS.,"All eyes upon the Minyæ were bent,"
2425,ORPHEUS.,Nor could they have enough of wondering
2426,ORPHEUS.,At this or that sea-tossed victorious king.
2427,ORPHEUS.,"So with the strangers there they held high feast,"
2428,ORPHEUS.,And afterwards the slaves drove many a beast
2429,ORPHEUS.,"Down to the shore, and carried back again"
2430,ORPHEUS.,Great store of precious things in pack and wain;
2431,ORPHEUS.,"Wrought gold and silver, gems, full many a bale"
2432,ORPHEUS.,"Of scarlet cloth, and fine silk, fit to veil"
2433,ORPHEUS.,The perfect limbs of dreaded Goddesses;
2434,ORPHEUS.,"Spices fresh-gathered from the outland trees,"
2435,ORPHEUS.,"And arms well-wrought, and precious scarce-known wine,"
2436,ORPHEUS.,And carven images well-nigh divine.
2437,ORPHEUS.,"So when all folk with these were satisfied,"
2438,ORPHEUS.,"Back went the Minyæ to the water-side,"
2439,ORPHEUS.,"And with them that old lord, fain to behold"
2440,ORPHEUS.,Victorious Argo and the Fleece of Gold.
2441,ORPHEUS.,And so aboard amid the oars he lay
2442,ORPHEUS.,"Throughout the night, and at the dawn of day"
2443,ORPHEUS.,"Did all men land, nor spared that day to wear"
2444,ORPHEUS.,"The best of all they had of gold-wrought gear,"
2445,ORPHEUS.,"And every one, being crowned with olive grey,"
2446,ORPHEUS.,"Up to the headland did they take their way,"
2447,ORPHEUS.,Where now already stood the crownèd priests
2448,ORPHEUS.,About the altars by the gilt-horned beasts.
2449,ORPHEUS.,"There, as the fair sun rose, did Jason break"
2450,ORPHEUS.,"Over the altar the thin barley-cake,"
2451,ORPHEUS.,"And cast the salt abroad, and there were slain"
2452,ORPHEUS.,"The milk-white bulls, and there red wine did rain"
2453,ORPHEUS.,"On to the fire from out the ancient jar,"
2454,ORPHEUS.,"And high rose up the red flame, seen afar"
2455,ORPHEUS.,From many another headland of that shore:
2456,ORPHEUS.,But over all its crackling and its roar
2457,ORPHEUS.,"Uprose from time to time a joyous song,"
2458,ORPHEUS.,"That on the summer morning lay for long,"
2459,ORPHEUS.,The mighty voices of the Minyæ
2460,ORPHEUS.,"Exulting o'er the tossing conquered sea,"
2461,ORPHEUS.,That far below thrust on by tide and wind

2656,THE WANDERER.,"Among the Greeks I gathered some small lore,"
2657,THE WANDERER.,"And standing midst the Væringers, still heard"
2658,THE WANDERER.,From this or that man many a wondrous word;
2659,THE WANDERER.,"For ye shall know that though we worshipped God,"
2660,THE WANDERER.,"And heard mass duly, still of Swithiod"
2661,THE WANDERER.,"The Greater, Odin and his house of gold,"
2662,THE WANDERER.,The noble stories ceased not to be told;
2663,THE WANDERER.,These moved me more than words of mine can say
2664,THE WANDERER.,E'en while at Micklegarth my folks did stay;
2665,THE WANDERER.,But when I reached one dying autumn-tide
2666,THE WANDERER.,"My uncle's dwelling near the forest side,"
2667,THE WANDERER.,"And saw the land so scanty and so bare,"
2668,THE WANDERER.,"And all the hard things men contend with there,"
2669,THE WANDERER.,"A little and unworthy land it seemed,"
2670,THE WANDERER.,"And yet the more of Asagard I dreamed,"
2671,THE WANDERER.,And worthier seemed the ancient faith of praise.
2672,THE WANDERER.,
2673,THE WANDERER.,"But now, but now--when one of all those days"
2674,THE WANDERER.,Like Lazarus' finger on my heart should be
2675,THE WANDERER.,"Breaking the fiery fixed eternity,"
2676,THE WANDERER.,But for one moment--could I see once more
2677,THE WANDERER.,"The grey-roofed sea-port sloping towards the shore,"
2678,THE WANDERER.,"Or note the brown boats standing in from sea,"
2679,THE WANDERER.,"Or the great dromond swinging from the quay,"
2680,THE WANDERER.,Or in the beech-woods watch the screaming jay
2681,THE WANDERER.,"Shoot up betwixt the tall trunks, smooth and grey--"
2682,THE WANDERER.,"Yea, could I see the days before distress"
2683,THE WANDERER.,When very longing was but happiness.
2684,THE WANDERER.,
2685,THE WANDERER.,Within our house there was a Breton squire
2686,THE WANDERER.,"Well learned, who fail'd not to fan the fire"
2687,THE WANDERER.,That evermore unholpen burned in me
2688,THE WANDERER.,Strange lands and things beyond belief to see;
2689,THE WANDERER.,Much lore of many lands this Breton knew;
2690,THE WANDERER.,"And for one tale I told, he told me two."
2691,THE WANDERER.,"He, counting Asagard a new-told thing,"
2692,THE WANDERER.,Yet spoke of gardens ever blossoming
2693,THE WANDERER.,"Across the western sea where none grew old,"
2694,THE WANDERER.,"E'en as the books at Micklegarth had told,"
2695,THE WANDERER.,And said moreover that an English knight
2696,THE WANDERER.,"Had had the Earthly Paradise in sight,"
2697,THE WANDERER.,And heard the songs of those that dwelt therein.
2698,THE WANDERER.,"But entered not, being hindered by his sin."
2699,THE WANDERER.,"Shortly, so much of this and that he said"
2700,THE WANDERER.,"That in my heart the sharp barb entered,"
2701,THE WANDERER.,"And like real life would empty stories seem,"
2702,THE WANDERER.,And life from day to day an empty dream.
2703,THE WANDERER.,
2704,THE WANDERER.,"Another man there was, a Swabian priest,"
2705,THE WANDERER.,"Who knew the maladies of man and beast,"
2706,THE WANDERER.,And what things helped them; he the stone still sought
2707,THE WANDERER.,"Whereby base metal into gold is brought,"
2708,THE WANDERER.,"And strove to gain the precious draught, whereby"
2709,THE WANDERER.,Men live midst mortal men yet never die;
2710,THE WANDERER.,Tales of the Kaiser Redbeard could he tell
2711,THE WANDERER.,"Who neither went to Heaven nor yet to Hell,"
2712,THE WANDERER.,When from that fight upon the Asian plain
2713,THE WANDERER.,"He vanished, but still lives to come again"
2714,THE WANDERER.,Men know not how or when; but I listening
2715,THE WANDERER.,Unto this tale thought it a certain thing
2716,THE WANDERER.,That in some hidden vale of Swithiod
2717,THE WANDERER.,Across the golden pavement still he trod.
2718,THE WANDERER.,
2719,THE WANDERER.,"But while our longing for such things so grew,"
2720,THE WANDERER.,"And ever more and more we deemed them true,"
2721,THE WANDERER.,Upon the land a pestilence there fell
2722,THE WANDERER.,"Unheard of yet in any chronicle,"
2723,THE WANDERER.,"And, as the people died full fast of it,"
2724,THE WANDERER.,"With these two men it chanced me once to sit,"
2725,THE WANDERER.,"This learned squire whose name was Nicholas,"
2726,THE WANDERER.,"And Swabian Laurence, as our manner was;"
2727,THE WANDERER.,For could we help it scarcely did we part
2728,THE WANDERER.,"From dawn to dusk: so heavy, sad at heart,"
2729,THE WANDERER.,We from the castle-yard beheld the bay
2730,THE WANDERER.,"Upon that ne'er-to-be-forgotten day,"
2731,THE WANDERER.,"Little we said amidst that dreary mood,"
2732,THE WANDERER.,And certes nought that we could say was good.
2733,THE WANDERER.,
2734,THE WANDERER.,"It was a bright September afternoon,"
2735,THE WANDERER.,The parched-up beech-trees would be yellowing soon
2736,THE WANDERER.,The yellow flowers grown deeper with the sun
2737,THE WANDERER.,Were letting fall their petals one by one;
2738,THE WANDERER.,"No wind there was, a haze was gathering o'er"
2739,THE WANDERER.,The furthest bound of the faint yellow shore;
2740,THE WANDERER.,And in the oily waters of the bay
2741,THE WANDERER.,"Scarce moving aught some fisher-cobles lay,"
2742,THE WANDERER.,And all seemed peace; and had been peace indeed
2743,THE WANDERER.,"But that we young men of our life had need,"
2744,THE WANDERER.,And to our listening ears a sound was borne
2745,THE WANDERER.,That made the sunlight wretched and forlorn--
2746,THE WANDERER.,--The heavy tolling of the minster bell--
2747,THE WANDERER.,And nigher yet a tinkling sound did tell
2748,THE WANDERER.,That through the streets they bore our Saviour Christ
2749,THE WANDERER.,By dying lips in anguish to be kissed.
2750,THE WANDERER.,
2751,THE WANDERER.,"At last spoke Nicholas, ""How long shall we"
2752,THE WANDERER.,"Abide here, looking forth into the sea"
2753,THE WANDERER.,Expecting when our turn shall come to die?
2754,THE WANDERER.,"Fair fellows, will ye come with me and try"
2755,THE WANDERER.,"Now at our worst that long-desired quest,"
2756,THE WANDERER.,"Now--when our worst is death, and life our best."""
2757,THE WANDERER.,"""Nay, but thou know'st,"" I said, ""that I but wait"
2758,THE WANDERER.,"The coming of some man, the turn of fate,"
2759,THE WANDERER.,"To make this voyage--but I die meanwhile,"
2760,THE WANDERER.,"For I am poor, though my blood be not vile,"
2761,THE WANDERER.,Nor yet for all his lore doth Laurence hold
2762,THE WANDERER.,Within his crucibles aught like to gold;
2763,THE WANDERER.,"And what hast thou, whose father driven forth"
2764,THE WANDERER.,"By Charles of Blois, found shelter in the North?"
2765,THE WANDERER.,"But little riches as I needs must deem."""
2766,THE WANDERER.,"""Well,"" said he, ""things are better than they seem,"
2767,THE WANDERER.,For 'neath my bed an iron chest I have
2768,THE WANDERER.,That holdeth things I have made shift to save
2769,THE WANDERER.,"E'en for this end; moreover, hark to this,"
2770,THE WANDERER.,In the next firth a fair long ship there is
2771,THE WANDERER.,"Well victualled, ready even now for sea,"
2772,THE WANDERER.,And I may say it 'longeth unto me;
2773,THE WANDERER.,"Since Marcus Erling, late its owner, lies"
2774,THE WANDERER.,"Dead at the end of many miseries,"
2775,THE WANDERER.,"And little Kirstin, as thou well mayst know,"
2776,THE WANDERER.,Would be content throughout the world to go
2777,THE WANDERER.,"If I but took her hand, and now still more"
2778,THE WANDERER.,Hath heart to leave this poor death-stricken shore.
2779,THE WANDERER.,Therefore my gold shall buy us Bordeaux swords
2780,THE WANDERER.,And Bordeaux wine as we go oceanwards.
2781,THE WANDERER.,"""What say ye, will ye go with me to-night,"
2782,THE WANDERER.,"Setting your faces to undreamed delight,"
2783,THE WANDERER.,"Turning your backs unto this troublous hell,"
2784,THE WANDERER.,"Or is the time too short to say farewell?"""
2785,THE WANDERER.,
2786,THE WANDERER.,"""Not so,"" I said, ""rather would I depart"
2787,THE WANDERER.,"Now while thou speakest, never has my heart"
2788,THE WANDERER.,"Been set on anything within this land."""
2789,THE WANDERER.,"Then said the Swabian, ""Let us now take hand"
2790,THE WANDERER.,And swear to follow evermore this quest
2791,THE WANDERER.,"Till death or life have set our hearts at rest."""
2792,THE WANDERER.,
2793,THE WANDERER.,"So with joined hands we swore, and Nicholas said,"
2794,THE WANDERER.,"""To-night, fair friends, be ye apparelled"
2795,THE WANDERER.,"To leave this land, bring all the arms ye can"
2796,THE WANDERER.,"And such men as ye trust, my own good man"
2797,THE WANDERER.,"Guards the small postern looking towards St. Bride,"
2798,THE WANDERER.,"And good it were ye should not be espied,"
2799,THE WANDERER.,"Since mayhap freely ye should not go hence,"
2800,THE WANDERER.,"Thou Rolf in special, for this pestilence"
2801,THE WANDERER.,"Makes all men hard and cruel, nor are they"
2802,THE WANDERER.,Willing that folk should 'scape if they must stay:
2803,THE WANDERER.,"Be wise; I bid you for a while farewell,"
2804,THE WANDERER.,Leave ye this stronghold when St. Peter's bell
2805,THE WANDERER.,"Strikes midnight, all will surely then be still,"
2806,THE WANDERER.,And I will bide you at King Tryggve's hill
2807,THE WANDERER.,"Outside the city gates."""
2808,THE WANDERER.,Each went his way
2809,THE WANDERER.,"Therewith, and I the remnant of that day"
2810,THE WANDERER.,"Gained for the quest three men that I deemed true,"
2811,THE WANDERER.,"And did such other things as I must do,"
2812,THE WANDERER.,And still was ever listening for the chime
2813,THE WANDERER.,"Half maddened by the lazy lapse of time,"
2814,THE WANDERER.,"Yea, scarce I thought indeed that I should live"
2815,THE WANDERER.,Till the great tower the joyful sound should give
2816,THE WANDERER.,"That set us free: and so the hours went past,"
2817,THE WANDERER.,Till startled by the echoing clang at last
2818,THE WANDERER.,"That told of midnight, armed from head to heel"
2819,THE WANDERER.,"Down to the open postern did I steal,"
2820,THE WANDERER.,Bearing small wealth--this sword that yet hangs here
2821,THE WANDERER.,"Worn thin and narrow with so many a year,"
2822,THE WANDERER.,"My father's axe that from Byzantium,"
2823,THE WANDERER.,"With some few gems my pouch yet held, had come,"
2824,THE WANDERER.,Nought else that shone with silver or with gold.
2825,THE WANDERER.,But by the postern gate could I behold
2826,THE WANDERER.,"Laurence the priest all armed as if for war,"
2827,THE WANDERER.,"From off the town-wall, having some small store"
2828,THE WANDERER.,Of arms and furs and raiment: then once more
2829,THE WANDERER.,"I turned, and saw the autumn moonlight fall"
2830,THE WANDERER.,"Upon the new-built bastions of the wall,"
2831,THE WANDERER.,"Strange with black shadow and grey flood of light,"
2832,THE WANDERER.,And further off I saw the lead shine bright
2833,THE WANDERER.,"On tower and turret-roof against the sky,"
2834,THE WANDERER.,And looking down I saw the old town lie
2835,THE WANDERER.,"Black in the shade of the o'er-hanging hill,"
2836,THE WANDERER.,"Stricken with death, and dreary, but all still"
2837,THE WANDERER.,"Until it reached the water of the bay,"
2838,THE WANDERER.,That in the dead night smote against the quay
2839,THE WANDERER.,"Not all unheard, though there was little wind."
2840,THE WANDERER.,"But as I turned to leave the place behind,"
2841,THE WANDERER.,"The wind's light sound, the slowly falling swell,"
2842,THE WANDERER.,"Were hushed at once by that shrill-tinkling bell,"
2843,THE WANDERER.,"That in that stillness jarring on mine ears,"
2844,THE WANDERER.,"With sudden jangle checked the rising tears,"
2845,THE WANDERER.,And now the freshness of the open sea
2846,THE WANDERER.,Seemed ease and joy and very life to me.
2847,THE WANDERER.,"So greeting my new mates with little sound,"
2848,THE WANDERER.,"We made good haste to reach King Tryggve's mound,"
2849,THE WANDERER.,"And there the Breton Nicholas beheld,"
2850,THE WANDERER.,"Who by the hand fair Kirstin Erling held,"
2851,THE WANDERER.,"And round about them twenty men there stood,"
2852,THE WANDERER.,Of whom the more part on the holy rood
2853,THE WANDERER.,"Were sworn till death to follow up the quest,"
2854,THE WANDERER.,And Kirstin was the mistress of the rest.
2855,THE WANDERER.,"Again betwixt us was there little speech,"
2856,THE WANDERER.,"But swiftly did we set on toward the beach,"
2857,THE WANDERER.,"And coming there our keel, the Fighting Man,"
2858,THE WANDERER.,"We boarded, and the long oars out we ran,"
2859,THE WANDERER.,"And swept from out the firth, and sped so well"
2860,THE WANDERER.,That scarcely could we hear St. Peter's bell
2861,THE WANDERER.,"Toll one, although the light wind blew from land;"
2862,THE WANDERER.,"Then hoisting sail southward we 'gan to stand,"
2863,THE WANDERER.,And much I joyed beneath the moon to see
2864,THE WANDERER.,The lessening land that might have been to me
2865,THE WANDERER.,"A kindly giver of wife, child, and friend,"
2866,THE WANDERER.,"And happy life, or at the worser end"
2867,THE WANDERER.,A quiet grave till doomsday rend the earth.
2868,THE WANDERER.,
2869,THE WANDERER.,"Night passed, day dawned, and we grew full of mirth"
2870,THE WANDERER.,As with the ever-rising morning wind
2871,THE WANDERER.,"Still further lay our threatened death behind,"
2872,THE WANDERER.,"Or so we thought: some eighty men we were,"
2873,THE WANDERER.,"Of whom but fifty knew the shipman's gear,"
2874,THE WANDERER.,The rest were uplanders; midst such of these
2875,THE WANDERER.,"As knew not of our quest, with promises"
2876,THE WANDERER.,"Went Nicholas dealing florins round about,"
2877,THE WANDERER.,"With still a fresh tale for each new man's doubt,"
2878,THE WANDERER.,Till all were fairly won or seemed to be
2879,THE WANDERER.,To that strange desperate voyage o'er the sea.
2880,THE WANDERER.,

2884,OGIER THE DANE.,OGIER THE DANE.
2885,OGIER THE DANE.,
2886,ARGUMENT.,ARGUMENT.
2887,ARGUMENT.,
2888,ARGUMENT.,"When Ogier was born, six fay ladies came to the cradle where he lay, and"
2889,ARGUMENT.,"gave him various gifts, as to be brave and happy and the like; but the"
2890,ARGUMENT.,sixth gave him to be her love when he should have lived long in the
2891,ARGUMENT.,"world: so Ogier grew up and became the greatest of knights, and at last,"
2892,ARGUMENT.,"after many years, fell into the hands of that fay, and with her, as the"
2893,ARGUMENT.,"story tells, he lives now, though he returned once to the world, as is"
2894,ARGUMENT.,shown in the process of this tale.
2895,ARGUMENT.,
2896,ARGUMENT.,
2897,ARGUMENT.,"Within some Danish city by the sea,"
2898,ARGUMENT.,"Whose name, changed now, is all unknown to me,"
2899,ARGUMENT.,"Great mourning was there one fair summer eve,"
2900,ARGUMENT.,"Because the angels, bidden to receive"
2901,ARGUMENT.,"The fair Queen's lovely soul in Paradise,"
2902,ARGUMENT.,"Had done their bidding, and in royal guise"
2903,ARGUMENT.,"Her helpless body, once the prize of love,"
2904,ARGUMENT.,"Unable now for fear or hope to move,"
2905,ARGUMENT.,Lay underneath the golden canopy;
2906,ARGUMENT.,And bowed down by unkingly misery
2907,ARGUMENT.,"The King sat by it, and not far away,"
2908,ARGUMENT.,"Within the chamber a fair man-child lay,"
2909,ARGUMENT.,"His mother's bane, the king that was to be,"
2910,ARGUMENT.,"Not witting yet of any royalty,"
2911,ARGUMENT.,"Harmless and loved, although so new to life."
2912,ARGUMENT.,
2913,ARGUMENT.,"Calm the June evening was, no sign of strife"
2914,ARGUMENT.,"The clear sky showed, no storm grew round the sun,"
2915,ARGUMENT.,Unhappy that his day of bliss was done;
2916,ARGUMENT.,"Dumb was the sea, and if the beech-wood stirred,"
2917,ARGUMENT.,'Twas with the nestling of the grey-winged bird
2918,ARGUMENT.,Midst its thick leaves; and though the nightingale
2919,ARGUMENT.,"Her ancient, hapless sorrow must bewail,"
2920,ARGUMENT.,No more of woe there seemed in her song
2921,ARGUMENT.,"Than such as doth to lovers' words belong,"
2922,ARGUMENT.,Because their love is still unsatisfied.
2923,ARGUMENT.,"But to the King, on that sweet eventide,"
2924,ARGUMENT.,"No earth there seemed, no heaven when earth was gone;"
2925,ARGUMENT.,"No help, no God! but lonely pain alone;"
2926,ARGUMENT.,"And he, midst unreal shadows, seemed to sit"
2927,ARGUMENT.,Himself the very heart and soul of it.
2928,ARGUMENT.,But round the cradle of the new-born child
2929,ARGUMENT.,The nurses now the weary time beguiled
2930,ARGUMENT.,With stories of the just departed Queen;
2931,ARGUMENT.,"And how, amid the heathen folk first seen,"
2932,ARGUMENT.,She had been won to love and godliness;
2933,ARGUMENT.,"And as they spoke, e'en midst his dull distress,"
2934,ARGUMENT.,An eager whisper now and then would smite
2935,ARGUMENT.,"Upon the King's ear, of some past delight,"
2936,ARGUMENT.,"Some once familiar name, and he would raise"
2937,ARGUMENT.,"His weary head, and on the speaker gaze"
2938,ARGUMENT.,"Like one about to speak, but soon again"
2939,ARGUMENT.,"Would drop his head and be alone with pain,"
2940,ARGUMENT.,"Nor think of these; who, silent in their turn,"
2941,ARGUMENT.,Would sit and watch the waxen tapers burn
2942,ARGUMENT.,"Amidst the dusk of the quick-gathering night,"
2943,ARGUMENT.,"Until beneath the high stars' glimmering light,"
2944,ARGUMENT.,The fresh earth lay in colourless repose.
2945,ARGUMENT.,"So passed the night, and now and then one rose"
2946,ARGUMENT.,From out her place to do what might avail
2947,ARGUMENT.,To still the new-born infant's fretful wail;
2948,ARGUMENT.,Or through the softly-opened door there came
2949,ARGUMENT.,"Some nurse new waked, who, whispering low the name"
2950,ARGUMENT.,"Of her whose turn was come, would take her place;"
2951,ARGUMENT.,Then toward the King would turn about her face
2952,ARGUMENT.,"And to her fellows whisper of the day,"
2953,ARGUMENT.,And tell again of her just past away.
2954,ARGUMENT.,
2955,ARGUMENT.,"So passed the night, the moon arose and grew,"
2956,ARGUMENT.,"From off the sea a little west-wind blew,"
2957,ARGUMENT.,Rustling the garden-leaves like sudden rain;
2958,ARGUMENT.,And ere the moon had 'gun to fall again
2959,ARGUMENT.,"The wind grew cold, a change was in the sky,"
2960,ARGUMENT.,And in deep silence did the dawn draw nigh;
2961,ARGUMENT.,Then from her place a nurse arose to light
2962,ARGUMENT.,"Fresh hallowed lights, for, dying with the night,"
2963,ARGUMENT.,The tapers round about the dead Queen were;
2964,ARGUMENT.,But the King raised his head and 'gan to stare
2965,ARGUMENT.,"Upon her, as her sweeping gown did glide"
2966,ARGUMENT.,"About the floor, that in the stillness cried"
2967,ARGUMENT.,Beneath her careful feet; and now as she
2968,ARGUMENT.,"Had lit the second candle carefully,"
2969,ARGUMENT.,And on its silver spike another one
2970,ARGUMENT.,"Was setting, through her body did there run"
2971,ARGUMENT.,"A sudden tremor, and the hand was stayed"
2972,ARGUMENT.,That on the dainty painted wax was laid;
2973,ARGUMENT.,"Her eyelids fell down and she seemed to sleep,"
2974,ARGUMENT.,And o'er the staring King began to creep
2975,ARGUMENT.,Sweet slumber too; the bitter lines of woe
2976,ARGUMENT.,"That drew his weary face did softer grow,"
2977,ARGUMENT.,"His eyelids dropped, his arms fell to his side;"
2978,ARGUMENT.,And moveless in their places did abide
2979,ARGUMENT.,"The nursing women, held by some strong spell,"
2980,ARGUMENT.,"E'en as they were, and utter silence fell"
2981,ARGUMENT.,"Upon the mournful, glimmering chamber fair."
2982,ARGUMENT.,"But now light footsteps coming up the stair,"
2983,ARGUMENT.,"Smote on the deadly stillness, and the sound"
2984,ARGUMENT.,Of silken dresses trailing o'er the ground;
2985,ARGUMENT.,"And heavenly odours through the chamber passed,"
2986,ARGUMENT.,Unlike the scents that rose and lily cast
2987,ARGUMENT.,Upon the freshness of the dying night;
2988,ARGUMENT.,Then nigher drew the sound of footsteps light
2989,ARGUMENT.,Until the door swung open noiselessly--
2990,ARGUMENT.,A mass of sunlit flowers there seemed to be
2991,ARGUMENT.,"Within the doorway, and but pale and wan"
2992,ARGUMENT.,"The flame showed now that serveth mortal man,"
2993,ARGUMENT.,As one by one six seeming ladies passed
2994,ARGUMENT.,"Into the room, and o'er its sorrow cast"
2995,ARGUMENT.,"That thoughtless sense of joy bewildering,"
2996,ARGUMENT.,That kisses youthful hearts amidst of spring;
2997,ARGUMENT.,"Crowned were they, in such glorious raiment clad,"
2998,ARGUMENT.,As yet no merchant of the world has had
2999,ARGUMENT.,Within his coffers; yet those crowns seemed fair
3000,ARGUMENT.,"Only because they kissed their odorous hair,"
3001,ARGUMENT.,And all that flowery raiment was but blessed
3002,ARGUMENT.,By those fair bodies that its splendour pressed.
3003,ARGUMENT.,"Now to the cradle from that glorious band,"
3004,ARGUMENT.,"A woman passed, and laid a tender hand"
3005,ARGUMENT.,"Upon the babe, and gently drew aside"
3006,ARGUMENT.,The swathings soft that did his body hide;
3007,ARGUMENT.,"And, seeing him so fair and great, she smiled,"
3008,ARGUMENT.,"And stooped, and kissed him, saying, ""O noble child,"
3009,ARGUMENT.,Have thou a gift from Gloriande this day;
3010,ARGUMENT.,For to the time when life shall pass away
3011,ARGUMENT.,"From this dear heart, no fear of death or shame,"
3012,ARGUMENT.,"No weariness of good shall foul thy name."""
3013,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, to her sisters she returned;"
3014,ARGUMENT.,"And one came forth, upon whose brow there burned"
3015,ARGUMENT.,"A crown of rubies, and whose heaving breast"
3016,ARGUMENT.,With happy rings a golden hauberk pressed;
3017,ARGUMENT.,"She took the babe, and somewhat frowning said,"
3018,ARGUMENT.,"""This gift I give, that till thy limbs are laid"
3019,ARGUMENT.,"At rest for ever, to thine honoured life"
3020,ARGUMENT.,"There never shall be lacking war and strife,"
3021,ARGUMENT.,"That thou a long-enduring name mayst win,"
3022,ARGUMENT.,"And by thy deeds, good pardon for thy sin."""
3023,ARGUMENT.,"With that another, who, unseen, meanwhile"
3024,ARGUMENT.,"Had drawn anigh, said with a joyous smile,"
3025,ARGUMENT.,"""And this forgotten gift to thee I give,"
3026,ARGUMENT.,"That while amidst the turmoil thou dost live,"
3027,ARGUMENT.,"Still shalt thou win the game, and unto thee"
3028,ARGUMENT.,"Defeat and shame but idle words shall be."""
3029,ARGUMENT.,"Then back they turned, and therewithal, the fourth"
3030,ARGUMENT.,"Said, ""Take this gift for what it may be worth"
3031,ARGUMENT.,"For that is mine to give; lo, thou shalt be"
3032,ARGUMENT.,"Gentle of speech, and in all courtesy"
3033,ARGUMENT.,"The first of men: a little gift this is,"
3034,ARGUMENT.,"After these promises of fame and bliss."""
3035,ARGUMENT.,Then toward the babe the fifth fair woman went;
3036,ARGUMENT.,"Grey-eyed she was, and simple, with eyes bent"
3037,ARGUMENT.,"Down on the floor, parted her red lips were,"
3038,ARGUMENT.,And o'er her sweet face marvellously fair
3039,ARGUMENT.,Oft would the colour spread full suddenly;
3040,ARGUMENT.,"Clad in a dainty gown and thin was she,"
3041,ARGUMENT.,"For some green summer of the fay-land dight,"
3042,ARGUMENT.,"Tripping she went, and laid her fingers light"
3043,ARGUMENT.,"Upon the child, and said, ""O little one,"
3044,ARGUMENT.,As long as thou shalt look upon the sun
3045,ARGUMENT.,Shall women long for thee; take heed to this
3046,ARGUMENT.,"And give them what thou canst of love and bliss."""
3047,ARGUMENT.,"Then, blushing for her words, therefrom she past,"
3048,ARGUMENT.,"And by the cradle stood the sixth and last,"
3049,ARGUMENT.,The fairest of them all; awhile she gazed
3050,ARGUMENT.,"Down on the child, and then her hand she raised,"
3051,ARGUMENT.,And made the one side of her bosom bare;
3052,ARGUMENT.,"""Ogier,"" she said, ""if this be foul or fair"
3053,ARGUMENT.,"Thou know'st not now, but when thine earthly life"
3054,ARGUMENT.,"Is drunk out to the dregs, and war and strife"
3055,ARGUMENT.,"Have yielded thee whatever joy they may,"
3056,ARGUMENT.,Thine head upon this bosom shalt thou lay;
3057,ARGUMENT.,"And then, despite of knowledge or of God,"
3058,ARGUMENT.,Will we be glad upon the flowery sod
3059,ARGUMENT.,Within the happy country where I dwell:
3060,ARGUMENT.,"Ogier, my love that is to be, farewell!"""
3061,ARGUMENT.,
3062,ARGUMENT.,"She turned, and even as they came they passed"
3063,ARGUMENT.,"From out the place, and reached the gate at last"
3064,ARGUMENT.,"That oped before their feet, and speedily"
3065,ARGUMENT.,"They gained the edges of the murmuring sea,"
3066,ARGUMENT.,"And as they stood in silence, gazing there"
3067,ARGUMENT.,"Out to the west, they vanished into air,"
3068,ARGUMENT.,"I know not how, nor whereto they returned."
3069,ARGUMENT.,
3070,ARGUMENT.,But mixed with twilight in the chamber burned
3071,ARGUMENT.,"The flickering candles, and those dreary folk,"
3072,ARGUMENT.,"Unlike to sleepers, from their trance awoke,"
3073,ARGUMENT.,But nought of what had happed meanwhile they knew.
3074,ARGUMENT.,Through the half-opened casements now there blew
3075,ARGUMENT.,"A sweet fresh air, that of the flowers and sea"
3076,ARGUMENT.,"Mingled together, smelt deliciously,"
3077,ARGUMENT.,And from the unseen sun the spreading light
3078,ARGUMENT.,"Began to make the fair June blossoms bright,"
3079,ARGUMENT.,"And midst their weary woe uprose the sun,"
3080,ARGUMENT.,And thus has Ogier's noble life begun.
3081,ARGUMENT.,
3082,ARGUMENT.,*     *     *     *     *
3083,ARGUMENT.,
3084,ARGUMENT.,"Hope is our life, when first our life grows clear;"
3085,ARGUMENT.,"Hope and delight, scarce crossed by lines of fear,"
3086,ARGUMENT.,"Yet the day comes when fain we would not hope,"
3087,ARGUMENT.,"But forasmuch as we with life must cope,"
3088,ARGUMENT.,"Struggling with this and that, and who knows why?"
3089,ARGUMENT.,"Hope will not give us up to certainty,"
3090,ARGUMENT.,"But still must bide with us: and with this man,"
3091,ARGUMENT.,Whose life amid such promises began
3092,ARGUMENT.,Great things she wrought; but now the time has come
3093,ARGUMENT.,When he no more on earth may have his home.
3094,ARGUMENT.,"Great things he suffered, great delights he had,"
3095,ARGUMENT.,Unto great kings he gave good deeds for bad;
3096,ARGUMENT.,He ruled o'er kingdoms where his name no more
3097,ARGUMENT.,"Is had in memory, and on many a shore"
3098,ARGUMENT.,He left his sweat and blood to win a name
3099,ARGUMENT.,Passing the bounds of earthly creatures' fame.
3100,ARGUMENT.,"A love he won and lost, a well-loved son"
3101,ARGUMENT.,Whose little day of promise soon was done:
3102,ARGUMENT.,"A tender wife he had, that he must leave"
3103,ARGUMENT.,Before his heart her love could well receive;
3104,ARGUMENT.,"Those promised gifts, that on his careless head"
3105,ARGUMENT.,In those first hours of his fair life were shed
3106,ARGUMENT.,"He took unwitting, and unwitting spent,"
3107,ARGUMENT.,Nor gave himself to grief and discontent
3108,ARGUMENT.,Because he saw the end a-drawing nigh.
3109,ARGUMENT.,"Where is he now? in what land must he die,"
3110,ARGUMENT.,To leave an empty name to us on earth?
3111,ARGUMENT.,"A tale half true, to cast across our mirth"
3112,ARGUMENT.,Some pensive thoughts of life that might have been;
3113,ARGUMENT.,"Where is he now, that all this life has seen?"
3114,ARGUMENT.,
3115,ARGUMENT.,"Behold, another eve I bid you see"
3116,ARGUMENT.,Than that calm eve of his nativity;
3117,ARGUMENT.,"The sun is setting in the west, the sky"
3118,ARGUMENT.,"Is clear and hard, and no clouds come anigh"
3119,ARGUMENT.,"The golden orb, but further off they lie,"
3120,ARGUMENT.,"Steel-grey and black with edges red as blood,"
3121,ARGUMENT.,And underneath them is the weltering flood
3122,ARGUMENT.,"Of some huge sea, whose tumbling hills, as they"
3123,ARGUMENT.,"Turn restless sides about, are black or grey,"
3124,ARGUMENT.,"Or green, or glittering with the golden flame;"
3125,ARGUMENT.,"The wind has fallen now, but still the same"
3126,ARGUMENT.,"The mighty army moves, as if to drown"
3127,ARGUMENT.,"This lone, bare rock, whose shear scarped sides of brown"
3128,ARGUMENT.,Cast off the weight of waves in clouds of spray.
3129,ARGUMENT.,Alas! what ships upon an evil day
3130,ARGUMENT.,Bent over to the wind in this ill sea?
3131,ARGUMENT.,"What navy, whose rent bones lie wretchedly"
3132,ARGUMENT.,"Beneath these cliffs? a mighty one it was,"
3133,ARGUMENT.,A fearful storm to bring such things to pass.
3134,ARGUMENT.,
3135,ARGUMENT.,This is the loadstone rock; no armament
3136,ARGUMENT.,"Of warring nations, in their madness bent"
3137,ARGUMENT.,Their course this way; no merchant wittingly
3138,ARGUMENT.,Has steered his keel unto this luckless sea;
3139,ARGUMENT.,"Upon no shipman's card its name is writ,"
3140,ARGUMENT.,Though worn-out mariners will speak of it
3141,ARGUMENT.,"Within the ingle on the winter's night,"
3142,ARGUMENT.,"When all within is warm and safe and bright,"
3143,ARGUMENT.,And the wind howls without: but 'gainst their will
3144,ARGUMENT.,"Are some folk driven here, and then all skill"
3145,ARGUMENT.,"Against this evil rock is vain and nought,"
3146,ARGUMENT.,And unto death the shipmen soon are brought;
3147,ARGUMENT.,"For then the keel, as by a giant's hand,"
3148,ARGUMENT.,"Is drawn unto that mockery of a land,"
3149,ARGUMENT.,And presently unto its sides doth cleave;
3150,ARGUMENT.,"When if they 'scape swift death, yet none may leave"
3151,ARGUMENT.,"The narrow limits of that barren isle,"
3152,ARGUMENT.,And thus are slain by famine in a while
3153,ARGUMENT.,"Mocked, as they say, by night with images"
3154,ARGUMENT.,"Of noble castles among groves of trees,"
3155,ARGUMENT.,By day with sounds of merry minstrelsy.
3156,ARGUMENT.,
3157,ARGUMENT.,"The sun sinks now below this hopeless sea,"
3158,ARGUMENT.,"The clouds are gone, and all the sky is bright;"
3159,ARGUMENT.,"The moon is rising o'er the growing night,"
3160,ARGUMENT.,And by its light may ye behold the bones
3161,ARGUMENT.,Of generations of these luckless ones
3162,ARGUMENT.,Scattered about the rock; but nigh the sea
3163,ARGUMENT.,"Sits one alive, who uncomplainingly"
3164,ARGUMENT.,"Awaits his death. White-haired is he and old,"
3165,ARGUMENT.,"Arrayed in royal raiment, bright with gold,"
3166,ARGUMENT.,But tarnished with the waves and rough salt air;
3167,ARGUMENT.,"Huge is he, of a noble face and fair,"
3168,ARGUMENT.,"As for an ancient man, though toil and eld"
3169,ARGUMENT.,Furrow the cheeks that ladies once beheld
3170,ARGUMENT.,"With melting hearts--Nay, listen, for he speaks!"
3171,ARGUMENT.,"""God, thou hast made me strong! nigh seven weeks"
3172,ARGUMENT.,"Have passed since from the wreck we haled our store,"
3173,ARGUMENT.,"And five long days well told, have now passed o'er"
3174,ARGUMENT.,"Since my last fellow died, with my last bread"
3175,ARGUMENT.,"Between his teeth, and yet I am not dead."
3176,ARGUMENT.,"Yea, but for this I had been strong enow"
3177,ARGUMENT.,In some last bloody field my sword to show.
3178,ARGUMENT.,"What matter? soon will all be past and done,"
3179,ARGUMENT.,Where'er I died I must have died alone:
3180,ARGUMENT.,"Yet, Caraheu, a good death had it been"
3181,ARGUMENT.,"Dying, thy face above me to have seen,"
3182,ARGUMENT.,"And heard my banner flapping in the wind,"
3183,ARGUMENT.,"Then, though my memory had not left thy mind,"
3184,ARGUMENT.,Yet hope and fear would not have vexed thee more
3185,ARGUMENT.,When thou hadst known that everything was o'er;
3186,ARGUMENT.,"But now thou waitest, still expecting me,"
3187,ARGUMENT.,Whose sail shall never speck thy bright blue sea.
3188,ARGUMENT.,"""And thou, Clarice, the merchants thou mayst call,"
3189,ARGUMENT.,"To tell thee tales within thy pictured hall,"
3190,ARGUMENT.,But never shall they tell true tales of me:
3191,ARGUMENT.,Whatever sails the Kentish hills may see
3192,ARGUMENT.,"Swept by the flood-tide toward thy well-walled town,"
3193,ARGUMENT.,No more on my sails shall they look adown.
3194,ARGUMENT.,"""Get thee another leader, Charlemaine,"
3195,ARGUMENT.,"For thou shalt look to see my shield in vain,"
3196,ARGUMENT.,"When in the fair fields of the Frankish land,"
3197,ARGUMENT.,"Thick as the corn they tread, the heathen stand."
3198,ARGUMENT.,"""What matter? ye shall learn to live your lives;"
3199,ARGUMENT.,"Husbands and children, other friends and wives,"
3200,ARGUMENT.,"Shall wipe the tablets of your memory clean,"
3201,ARGUMENT.,And all shall be as I had never been.
3202,ARGUMENT.,
3203,ARGUMENT.,"""And now, O God, am I alone with Thee;"
3204,ARGUMENT.,A little thing indeed it seems to be
3205,ARGUMENT.,"To give this life up, since it needs must go"
3206,ARGUMENT.,Some time or other; now at last I know
3207,ARGUMENT.,"How foolishly men play upon the earth,"
3208,ARGUMENT.,When unto them a year of life seems worth
3209,ARGUMENT.,"Honour and friends, and these vague hopes and sweet"
3210,ARGUMENT.,"That like real things my dying heart do greet,"
3211,ARGUMENT.,"Unreal while living on the earth I trod,"
3212,ARGUMENT.,And but myself I knew no other god.
3213,ARGUMENT.,"Behold, I thank Thee that Thou sweet'nest thus"
3214,ARGUMENT.,"This end, that I had thought most piteous,"
3215,ARGUMENT.,"If of another I had heard it told."""
3216,ARGUMENT.,
3217,ARGUMENT.,"What man is this, who weak and worn and old,"
3218,ARGUMENT.,"Gives up his life within that dreadful isle,"
3219,ARGUMENT.,And on the fearful coming death can smile?
3220,ARGUMENT.,"Alas! this man, so battered and outworn,"
3221,ARGUMENT.,"Is none but he, who, on that summer morn,"
3222,ARGUMENT.,Received such promises of glorious life:
3223,ARGUMENT.,"Ogier the Dane this is, to whom all strife"
3224,ARGUMENT.,"Was but as wine to stir awhile the blood,"
3225,ARGUMENT.,"To whom all life, however hard, was good:"
3226,ARGUMENT.,"This is the man, unmatched of heart and limb,"
3227,ARGUMENT.,"Ogier the Dane, whose sight has waxed not dim"
3228,ARGUMENT.,For all the years that he on earth has dwelt;
3229,ARGUMENT.,"Ogier the Dane, that never fear has felt,"
3230,ARGUMENT.,"Since he knew good from ill; Ogier the Dane,"
3231,ARGUMENT.,"The heathen's dread, the evil-doer's bane."
3232,ARGUMENT.,
3233,ARGUMENT.,*     *     *     *     *
3234,ARGUMENT.,
3235,ARGUMENT.,"Bright had the moon grown as his words were done,"
3236,ARGUMENT.,And no more was there memory of the sun
3237,ARGUMENT.,"Within the west, and he grew drowsy now,"
3238,ARGUMENT.,And somewhat smoother was his wrinkled brow
3239,ARGUMENT.,"As thought died out beneath the hand of sleep,"
3240,ARGUMENT.,"And o'er his soul forgetfulness did creep,"
3241,ARGUMENT.,Hiding the image of swift-coming death;
3242,ARGUMENT.,Until as peacefully he drew his breath
3243,ARGUMENT.,"As on that day, past for a hundred years,"
3244,ARGUMENT.,"When, midst the nurse's quickly-falling tears,"
3245,ARGUMENT.,He fell asleep to his first lullaby.
3246,ARGUMENT.,"The night changed as he slept, white clouds and high"
3247,ARGUMENT.,Began about the lonely moon to close;
3248,ARGUMENT.,"And from the dark west a new wind arose,"
3249,ARGUMENT.,And with the sound of heavy-falling waves
3250,ARGUMENT.,Mingled its pipe about the loadstone caves;
3251,ARGUMENT.,"But when the twinkling stars were hid away,"
3252,ARGUMENT.,"And a faint light and broad, like dawn of day,"
3253,ARGUMENT.,"The moon upon that dreary country shed,"
3254,ARGUMENT.,"Ogier awoke, and lifting up his head"
3255,ARGUMENT.,"And smiling, muttered, ""Nay, no more again;"
3256,ARGUMENT.,"Rather some pleasure new, some other pain,"
3257,ARGUMENT.,"Unthought of both, some other form of strife;"""
3258,ARGUMENT.,"For he had waked from dreams of his old life,"
3259,ARGUMENT.,And through St. Omer's archer-guarded gate
3260,ARGUMENT.,"Once more had seemed to pass, and saw the state"
3261,ARGUMENT.,"Of that triumphant king; and still, though all"
3262,ARGUMENT.,"Seemed changed, and folk by other names did call"
3263,ARGUMENT.,"Faces he knew of old, yet none the less"
3264,ARGUMENT.,"He seemed the same, and, midst that mightiness,"
3265,ARGUMENT.,"Felt his own power, and grew the more athirst"
3266,ARGUMENT.,"For coming glory, as of old, when first"
3267,ARGUMENT.,"He stood before the face of Charlemaine,"
3268,ARGUMENT.,A helpless hostage with all life to gain.
3269,ARGUMENT.,"But now, awake, his worn face once more sank"
3270,ARGUMENT.,"Between his hands, and, murmuring not, he drank"
3271,ARGUMENT.,The draught of death that must that thirst allay.
3272,ARGUMENT.,
3273,ARGUMENT.,But while he sat and waited for the day
3274,ARGUMENT.,"A sudden light across the bare rock streamed,"
3275,ARGUMENT.,"Which at the first he noted not, but deemed"
3276,ARGUMENT.,The moon her fleecy veil had broken through;
3277,ARGUMENT.,But ruddier indeed this new light grew
3278,ARGUMENT.,"Than were the moon's grey beams, and, therewithal,"
3279,ARGUMENT.,Soft far-off music on his ears did fall;
3280,ARGUMENT.,"Yet moved he not, but murmured, ""This is death,"
3281,ARGUMENT.,"An easy thing like this to yield my breath,"
3282,ARGUMENT.,"Awake, yet dreaming, with no sounds of fear,"
3283,ARGUMENT.,No dreadful sights to tell me it is near;
3284,ARGUMENT.,"Yea, God, I thank Thee!"" but with that last word"
3285,ARGUMENT.,It seemed to him that he his own name heard
3286,ARGUMENT.,"Whispered, as though the wind had borne it past;"
3287,ARGUMENT.,"With that he gat unto his feet at last,"
3288,ARGUMENT.,"But still awhile he stood, with sunken head,"
3289,ARGUMENT.,"And in a low and trembling voice he said,"
3290,ARGUMENT.,"""Lord, I am ready, whither shall I go?"
3291,ARGUMENT.,"I pray Thee unto me some token show."""
3292,ARGUMENT.,"And, as he said this, round about he turned,"
3293,ARGUMENT.,And in the east beheld a light that burned
3294,ARGUMENT.,"As bright as day; then, though his flesh might fear"
3295,ARGUMENT.,"The coming change that he believed so near,"
3296,ARGUMENT.,"Yet did his soul rejoice, for now he thought"
3297,ARGUMENT.,Unto the very heaven to be brought:
3298,ARGUMENT.,"And though he felt alive, deemed it might be"
3299,ARGUMENT.,That he in sleep had died full easily.
3300,ARGUMENT.,"Then toward that light did he begin to go,"
3301,ARGUMENT.,"And still those strains he heard, far off and low,"
3302,ARGUMENT.,That grew no louder; still that bright light streamed
3303,ARGUMENT.,"Over the rocks, yet nothing brighter seemed,"
3304,ARGUMENT.,But like the light of some unseen bright flame
3305,ARGUMENT.,"Shone round about, until at last he came"
3306,ARGUMENT.,"Unto the dreary islet's other shore,"
3307,ARGUMENT.,"And then the minstrelsy he heard no more,"
3308,ARGUMENT.,And softer seemed the strange light unto him;
3309,ARGUMENT.,"But yet or ever it had grown quite dim,"
3310,ARGUMENT.,Beneath its waning light could he behold
3311,ARGUMENT.,"A mighty palace set about with gold,"
3312,ARGUMENT.,Above green meads and groves of summer trees
3313,ARGUMENT.,Far-off across the welter of the seas;
3314,ARGUMENT.,"But, as he gazed, it faded from his sight,"
3315,ARGUMENT.,"And the grey hidden moon's diffused soft light,"
3316,ARGUMENT.,"Which soothly was but darkness to him now,"
3317,ARGUMENT.,His sea-girt island prison did but show.
3318,ARGUMENT.,"But o'er the sea he still gazed wistfully,"
3319,ARGUMENT.,"And said, ""Alas! and when will this go by"
3320,ARGUMENT.,And leave my soul in peace? must I still dream
3321,ARGUMENT.,"Of life that once so dear a thing did seem,"
3322,ARGUMENT.,"That, when I wake, death may the bitterer be?"
3323,ARGUMENT.,"Here will I sit until he come to me,"
3324,ARGUMENT.,"And hide mine eyes and think upon my sin,"
3325,ARGUMENT.,That so a little calm I yet may win
3326,ARGUMENT.,"Before I stand within the awful place."""
3327,ARGUMENT.,"Then down he sat and covered up his face,"
3328,ARGUMENT.,"Yet therewithal his trouble could not hide,"
3329,ARGUMENT.,"Nor waiting thus for death could he abide,"
3330,ARGUMENT.,"For, though he knew it not, the yearning pain"
3331,ARGUMENT.,Of hope of life had touched his soul again--
3332,ARGUMENT.,"If he could live awhile, if he could live!"
3333,ARGUMENT.,"The mighty being, who once was wont to give"
3334,ARGUMENT.,The gift of life to many a trembling man;
3335,ARGUMENT.,Who did his own will since his life began;
3336,ARGUMENT.,"Who feared not aught, but strong and great and free"
3337,ARGUMENT.,Still cast aside the thought of what might be;
3338,ARGUMENT.,"Must all this then be lost, and with no will,"
3339,ARGUMENT.,"Powerless and blind, must he some fate fulfil,"
3340,ARGUMENT.,Nor know what he is doing any more?
3341,ARGUMENT.,
3342,ARGUMENT.,"Soon he arose and paced along the shore,"
3343,ARGUMENT.,And gazed out seaward for the blessed light;
3344,ARGUMENT.,"But nought he saw except the old sad sight,"
3345,ARGUMENT.,"The ceaseless tumbling of the billows grey,"
3346,ARGUMENT.,The white upspringing of the spurts of spray
3347,ARGUMENT.,"Amidst that mass of timbers, the rent bones"
3348,ARGUMENT.,Of the sea-houses of the hapless ones
3349,ARGUMENT.,Once cast like him upon this deadly isle.
3350,ARGUMENT.,"He stopped his pacing in a little while,"
3351,ARGUMENT.,"And clenched his mighty hands, and set his teeth,"
3352,ARGUMENT.,"And gazing at the ruin underneath,"
3353,ARGUMENT.,"He swung from off the bare cliff's jagged brow,"
3354,ARGUMENT.,"And on some slippery ledge he wavered now,"
3355,ARGUMENT.,"Without a hand-hold, and now stoutly clung"
3356,ARGUMENT.,"With hands alone, and o'er the welter hung,"
3357,ARGUMENT.,Not caring aught if thus his life should end;
3358,ARGUMENT.,But safely midst all this did he descend
3359,ARGUMENT.,"The dreadful cliff, and since no beach was there,"
3360,ARGUMENT.,"But from the depths the rock rose stark and bare,"
3361,ARGUMENT.,"Nor crumbled aught beneath the hammering sea,"
3362,ARGUMENT.,Upon the wrecks he stood unsteadily.
3363,ARGUMENT.,
3364,ARGUMENT.,"But now, amid the clamour of the waves,"
3365,ARGUMENT.,"And washing to-and-fro of beams and staves,"
3366,ARGUMENT.,"Dizzy with hunger, dreamy with distress,"
3367,ARGUMENT.,"And all those days of fear and loneliness,"
3368,ARGUMENT.,"The ocean's tumult seemed the battle's roar,"
3369,ARGUMENT.,"His heart grew hot, as when in days of yore"
3370,ARGUMENT.,He heard the cymbals clash amid the crowd
3371,ARGUMENT.,"Of dusky faces; now he shouted loud,"
3372,ARGUMENT.,"And from crushed beam to beam began to leap,"
3373,ARGUMENT.,And yet his footing somehow did he keep
3374,ARGUMENT.,"Amidst their tossing, and indeed the sea"
3375,ARGUMENT.,Was somewhat sunk upon the island's lee.
3376,ARGUMENT.,"So quickly on from wreck to wreck he passed,"
3377,ARGUMENT.,"And reached the outer line of wrecks at last,"
3378,ARGUMENT.,"And there a moment stood unsteadily,"
3379,ARGUMENT.,"Amid the drift of spray that hurried by,"
3380,ARGUMENT.,"And drew Courtain his sword from out its sheath,"
3381,ARGUMENT.,"And poised himself to meet the coming death,"
3382,ARGUMENT.,"Still looking out to sea; but as he gazed,"
3383,ARGUMENT.,And once or twice his doubtful feet he raised
3384,ARGUMENT.,"To take the final plunge, that heavenly strain"
3385,ARGUMENT.,"Over the washing waves he heard again,"
3386,ARGUMENT.,And from the dimness something bright he saw
3387,ARGUMENT.,Across the waste of waters towards him draw;
3388,ARGUMENT.,"And hidden now, now raised aloft, at last"
3389,ARGUMENT.,"Unto his very feet a boat was cast,"
3390,ARGUMENT.,"Gilded inside and out, and well arrayed"
3391,ARGUMENT.,With cushions soft; far fitter to have weighed
3392,ARGUMENT.,"From some sweet garden on the shallow Seine,"
3393,ARGUMENT.,"Or in a reach of green Thames to have lain,"
3394,ARGUMENT.,Than struggle with that huge confusèd sea;
3395,ARGUMENT.,But Ogier gazed upon it doubtfully
3396,ARGUMENT.,"One moment, and then, sheathing Courtain, said,"
3397,ARGUMENT.,"""What tales are these about the newly dead"
3398,ARGUMENT.,"The heathen told? what matter, let all pass;"
3399,ARGUMENT.,"This moment as one dead indeed I was,"
3400,ARGUMENT.,"And this must be what I have got to do,"
3401,ARGUMENT.,I yet perchance may light on something new
3402,ARGUMENT.,Before I die; though yet perchance this keel
3403,ARGUMENT.,Unto the wondrous mass of charmed steel
3404,ARGUMENT.,"Is drawn as others."" With that word he leapt"
3405,ARGUMENT.,"Into the boat, and o'er the cushions crept"
3406,ARGUMENT.,"From stem to stern, but found no rudder there,"
3407,ARGUMENT.,"Nor any oars, nor were the cushions fair"
3408,ARGUMENT.,Made wet by any dashing of the sea.
3409,ARGUMENT.,"Now while he pondered how these things could be,"
3410,ARGUMENT.,"The boat began to move therefrom at last,"
3411,ARGUMENT.,"But over him a drowsiness was cast,"
3412,ARGUMENT.,"And as o'er tumbling hills the skiff did pass,"
3413,ARGUMENT.,He clean forgot his death and where he was.
3414,ARGUMENT.,
3415,ARGUMENT.,"At last he woke up to a sunny day,"
3416,ARGUMENT.,"And, looking round, saw that his shallop lay"
3417,ARGUMENT.,Moored at the edge of some fair tideless sea
3418,ARGUMENT.,"Unto an overhanging thick-leaved tree,"
3419,ARGUMENT.,Where in the green waves did the low bank dip
3420,ARGUMENT.,Its fresh and green grass-covered daisied lip;
3421,ARGUMENT.,But Ogier looking thence no more could see
3422,ARGUMENT.,"That sad abode of death and misery,"
3423,ARGUMENT.,"Nor aught but wide and empty ocean, grey"
3424,ARGUMENT.,"With gathering haze, for now it neared midday;"
3425,ARGUMENT.,"Then from the golden cushions did he rise,"
3426,ARGUMENT.,And wondering still if this were Paradise
3427,ARGUMENT.,"He stepped ashore, but drew Courtain his sword"
3428,ARGUMENT.,And muttered therewithal a holy word.
3429,ARGUMENT.,"Fair was the place, as though amidst of May,"
3430,ARGUMENT.,"Nor did the brown birds fear the sunny day,"
3431,ARGUMENT.,For with their quivering song the air was sweet;
3432,ARGUMENT.,"Thick grew the field-flowers underneath his feet,"
3433,ARGUMENT.,"And on his head the blossoms down did rain,"
3434,ARGUMENT.,Yet mid these fair things slowly and with pain
3435,ARGUMENT.,"He 'gan to go, yea, even when his foot"
3436,ARGUMENT.,"First touched the flowery sod, to his heart's root"
3437,ARGUMENT.,"A coldness seemed to strike, and now each limb"
3438,ARGUMENT.,"Was growing stiff, his eyes waxed bleared and dim,"
3439,ARGUMENT.,"And all his stored-up memory 'gan to fail,"
3440,ARGUMENT.,Nor yet would his once mighty heart avail
3441,ARGUMENT.,For lamentations o'er his changed lot;
3442,ARGUMENT.,"Yet urged by some desire, he knew not what,"
3443,ARGUMENT.,"Along a little path 'twixt hedges sweet,"
3444,ARGUMENT.,"Drawn sword in hand, he dragged his faltering feet,"
3445,ARGUMENT.,"For what then seemed to him a weary way,"
3446,ARGUMENT.,Whereon his steps he needs must often stay
3447,ARGUMENT.,And lean upon the mighty well-worn sword
3448,ARGUMENT.,"That in those hands, grown old, for king or lord"
3449,ARGUMENT.,Had small respect in glorious days long past.
3450,ARGUMENT.,
3451,ARGUMENT.,"But still he crept along, and at the last"
3452,ARGUMENT.,"Came to a gilded wicket, and through this"
3453,ARGUMENT.,"Entered a garden fit for utmost bliss,"
3454,ARGUMENT.,If that might last which needs must soon go by:
3455,ARGUMENT.,"There 'gainst a tree he leaned, and with a sigh"
3456,ARGUMENT.,"He said, ""O God, a sinner I have been,"
3457,ARGUMENT.,And good it is that I these things have seen
3458,ARGUMENT.,Before I meet what Thou hast set apart
3459,ARGUMENT.,To cleanse the earthly folly from my heart;
3460,ARGUMENT.,But who within this garden now can dwell
3461,ARGUMENT.,"Wherein guilt first upon the world befell?"""
3462,ARGUMENT.,"A little further yet he staggered on,"
3463,ARGUMENT.,"Till to a fountain-side at last he won,"
3464,ARGUMENT.,"O'er which two white-thorns their sweet blossoms shed,"
3465,ARGUMENT.,"There he sank down, and laid his weary head"
3466,ARGUMENT.,"Beside the mossy roots, and in a while"
3467,ARGUMENT.,"He slept, and dreamed himself within the isle;"
3468,ARGUMENT.,"That splashing fount the weary sea did seem,"
3469,ARGUMENT.,And in his dream the fair place but a dream;
3470,ARGUMENT.,But when again to feebleness he woke
3471,ARGUMENT.,"Upon his ears that heavenly music broke,"
3472,ARGUMENT.,"Not faint or far as in the isle it was,"
3473,ARGUMENT.,But e'en as though the minstrels now did pass
3474,ARGUMENT.,"Anigh his resting-place; then fallen in doubt,"
3475,ARGUMENT.,"E'en as he might, he rose and gazed about,"
3476,ARGUMENT.,Leaning against the hawthorn stem with pain;
3477,ARGUMENT.,"And yet his straining gaze was but in vain,"
3478,ARGUMENT.,"Death stole so fast upon him, and no more"
3479,ARGUMENT.,"Could he behold the blossoms as before,"
3480,ARGUMENT.,"No more the trees seemed rooted to the ground,"
3481,ARGUMENT.,"A heavy mist seemed gathering all around,"
3482,ARGUMENT.,"And in its heart some bright thing seemed to be,"
3483,ARGUMENT.,And round his head there breathed deliciously
3484,ARGUMENT.,"Sweet odours, and that music never ceased."
3485,ARGUMENT.,But as the weight of Death's strong hand increased
3486,ARGUMENT.,"Again he sank adown, and Courtain's noise"
3487,ARGUMENT.,Within the scabbard seemed a farewell voice
3488,ARGUMENT.,"Sent from the world he loved so well of old,"
3489,ARGUMENT.,"And all his life was as a story told,"
3490,ARGUMENT.,And as he thought thereof he 'gan to smile
3491,ARGUMENT.,"E'en as a child asleep, but in a while"
3492,ARGUMENT.,"It was as though he slept, and sleeping dreamed,"
3493,ARGUMENT.,"For in his half-closed eyes a glory gleamed,"
3494,ARGUMENT.,"As though from some sweet face and golden hair,"
3495,ARGUMENT.,"And on his breast were laid soft hands and fair,"
3496,ARGUMENT.,"And a sweet voice was ringing in his ears,"
3497,ARGUMENT.,Broken as if with flow of joyous tears;
3498,ARGUMENT.,"""Ogier, sweet friend, hast thou not tarried long?"
3499,ARGUMENT.,"Alas! thine hundred years of strife and wrong!"""
3500,ARGUMENT.,"Then he found voice to say, ""Alas! dear Lord,"
3501,ARGUMENT.,"Too long, too long; and yet one little word"
3502,ARGUMENT.,"Right many a year agone had brought me here."""
3503,ARGUMENT.,"Then to his face that face was drawn anear,"
3504,ARGUMENT.,He felt his head raised up and gently laid
3505,ARGUMENT.,"On some kind knee, again the sweet voice said,"
3506,ARGUMENT.,"""Nay, Ogier, nay, not yet, not yet, dear friend!"
3507,ARGUMENT.,"Who knoweth when our linked life shall end,"
3508,ARGUMENT.,"Since thou art come unto mine arms at last,"
3509,ARGUMENT.,And all the turmoil of the world is past?
3510,ARGUMENT.,Why do I linger ere I see thy face
3511,ARGUMENT.,As I desired it in that mourning place
3512,ARGUMENT.,"So many years ago--so many years,"
3513,ARGUMENT.,"Thou knewest not thy love and all her fears?"""
3514,ARGUMENT.,"""Alas!"" he said, ""what mockery is this"
3515,ARGUMENT.,That thou wilt speak to me of earthly bliss?
3516,ARGUMENT.,"No longer can I think upon the earth,"
3517,ARGUMENT.,Have I not done with all its grief and mirth?
3518,ARGUMENT.,"Yes, I was Ogier once, but if my love"
3519,ARGUMENT.,"Should come once more my dying heart to move,"
3520,ARGUMENT.,Then must she come from 'neath the milk-white walls
3521,ARGUMENT.,Whereon to-day the hawthorn blossom falls
3522,ARGUMENT.,Outside St. Omer's--art thou she? her name
3523,ARGUMENT.,I could remember once mid death and fame
3524,ARGUMENT.,"Is clean forgotten now; but yesterday,"
3525,ARGUMENT.,"Meseems, our son, upon her bosom lay:"
3526,ARGUMENT.,Baldwin the fair--what hast thou done with him
3527,ARGUMENT.,"Since Charlot slew him? Ah, mine eyes wax dim;"
3528,ARGUMENT.,"Woman, forbear! wilt thou not let me die?"
3529,ARGUMENT.,Did I forget thee in the days gone by?
3530,ARGUMENT.,"Then let me die, that we may meet again!"""
3531,ARGUMENT.,
3532,ARGUMENT.,"He tried to move from her, but all in vain,"
3533,ARGUMENT.,"For life had well-nigh left him, but withal"
3534,ARGUMENT.,"He felt a kiss upon his forehead fall,"
3535,ARGUMENT.,And could not speak; he felt slim fingers fair
3536,ARGUMENT.,"Move to his mighty sword-worn hand, and there"
3537,ARGUMENT.,"Set on some ring, and still he could not speak,"
3538,ARGUMENT.,And once more sleep weighed down his eyelids weak.
3539,ARGUMENT.,
3540,ARGUMENT.,*     *     *     *     *
3541,ARGUMENT.,
3542,ARGUMENT.,"But, ah! what land was this he woke unto?"
3543,ARGUMENT.,What joy was this that filled his heart anew?
3544,ARGUMENT.,Had he then gained the very Paradise?
3545,ARGUMENT.,"Trembling, he durst not at the first arise,"
3546,ARGUMENT.,"Although no more he felt the pain of eld,"
3547,ARGUMENT.,Nor durst he raise his eyes that now beheld
3548,ARGUMENT.,Beside him the white flowers and blades of grass;
3549,ARGUMENT.,"He durst not speak, lest he some monster was."
3550,ARGUMENT.,"But while he lay and hoped, that gentle voice"
3551,ARGUMENT.,"Once more he heard; ""Yea, thou mayst well rejoice!"
3552,ARGUMENT.,"Thou livest still, my sweet, thou livest still,"
3553,ARGUMENT.,Apart from every earthly fear and ill;
3554,ARGUMENT.,"Wilt thou not love me, who have wrought thee this,"
3555,ARGUMENT.,"That I like thee may live in double bliss?"""
3556,ARGUMENT.,"Then Ogier rose up, nowise like to one"
3557,ARGUMENT.,"Whose span of earthly life is nigh outrun,"
3558,ARGUMENT.,But as he might have risen in old days
3559,ARGUMENT.,To see the spears cleave the fresh morning haze;
3560,ARGUMENT.,"But, looking round, he saw no change there was"
3561,ARGUMENT.,"In the fair place wherethrough he first did pass,"
3562,ARGUMENT.,"Though all, grown clear and joyous to his eyes,"
3563,ARGUMENT.,Now looked no worse than very Paradise;
3564,ARGUMENT.,"Behind him were the thorns, the fountain fair"
3565,ARGUMENT.,"Still sent its glittering stream forth into air,"
3566,ARGUMENT.,"And by its basin a fair woman stood,"
3567,ARGUMENT.,And as their eyes met his renewèd blood
3568,ARGUMENT.,Rushed to his face; with unused thoughts and sweet
3569,ARGUMENT.,"And hurrying hopes, his heart began to beat."
3570,ARGUMENT.,The fairest of all creatures did she seem;
3571,ARGUMENT.,So fresh and delicate you well might deem
3572,ARGUMENT.,That scarce for eighteen summers had she blessed
3573,ARGUMENT.,"The happy, longing world; yet, for the rest,"
3574,ARGUMENT.,Within her glorious eyes such wisdom dwelt
3575,ARGUMENT.,"A child before her had the wise man felt,"
3576,ARGUMENT.,And with the pleasure of a thousand years
3577,ARGUMENT.,Her lips were fashioned to move joy or tears
3578,ARGUMENT.,"Among the longing folk where she might dwell,"
3579,ARGUMENT.,To give at last the kiss unspeakable.
3580,ARGUMENT.,"In such wise was she clad as folk may be,"
3581,ARGUMENT.,"Who, for no shame of their humanity,"
3582,ARGUMENT.,"For no sad changes of the imperfect year,"
3583,ARGUMENT.,"Rather for added beauty, raiment wear;"
3584,ARGUMENT.,"For, as the heat-foretelling grey-blue haze"
3585,ARGUMENT.,"Veils the green flowery morn of late May-days,"
3586,ARGUMENT.,Her raiment veiled her; where the bands did meet
3587,ARGUMENT.,"That bound the sandals to her dainty feet,"
3588,ARGUMENT.,"Gems gleamed; a fresh rose-wreath embraced her head,"
3589,ARGUMENT.,And on her breast there lay a ruby red.
3590,ARGUMENT.,So with a supplicating look she turned
3591,ARGUMENT.,"To meet the flame that in his own eyes burned,"
3592,ARGUMENT.,"And held out both her white arms lovingly,"
3593,ARGUMENT.,As though to greet him as he drew anigh.
3594,ARGUMENT.,"Stammering he said, ""Who art thou? how am I"
3595,ARGUMENT.,"So cured of all my evils suddenly,"
3596,ARGUMENT.,"That certainly I felt no mightier, when,"
3597,ARGUMENT.,"Amid the backward rush of beaten men,"
3598,ARGUMENT.,About me drooped the axe-torn Oriflamme?
3599,ARGUMENT.,"Alas! I fear that in some dream I am."""
3600,ARGUMENT.,"""Ogier,"" she said, ""draw near, perchance it is"
3601,ARGUMENT.,That such a name God gives unto our bliss;
3602,ARGUMENT.,"I know not, but if thou art such an one"
3603,ARGUMENT.,"As I must deem, all days beneath the sun"
3604,ARGUMENT.,"That thou hast had, shall be but dreams indeed"
3605,ARGUMENT.,To those that I have given thee at thy need.
3606,ARGUMENT.,For many years ago beside the sea
3607,ARGUMENT.,"When thou wert born, I plighted troth with thee:"
3608,ARGUMENT.,"Come near then, and make mirrors of mine eyes,"
3609,ARGUMENT.,That thou mayest see what these my mysteries
3610,ARGUMENT.,"Have wrought in thee; surely but thirty years,"
3611,ARGUMENT.,"Passed amidst joy, thy new born body bears,"
3612,ARGUMENT.,"Nor while thou art with me, and on this shore"
3613,ARGUMENT.,"Art still full-fed of love, shalt thou seem more."
3614,ARGUMENT.,"Nay, love, come nigher, and let me take thine hand,"
3615,ARGUMENT.,"The hope and fear of many a warring land,"
3616,ARGUMENT.,"And I will show thee wherein lies the spell,"
3617,ARGUMENT.,"Whereby this happy change upon thee fell."""
3618,ARGUMENT.,
3619,ARGUMENT.,"Like a shy youth before some royal love,"
3620,ARGUMENT.,"Close up to that fair woman did he move,"
3621,ARGUMENT.,And their hands met; yet to his changed voice
3622,ARGUMENT.,"He dared not trust; nay, scarcely could rejoice"
3623,ARGUMENT.,"E'en when her balmy breath he 'gan to feel,"
3624,ARGUMENT.,And felt strange sweetness o'er his spirit steal
3625,ARGUMENT.,"As her light raiment, driven by the wind,"
3626,ARGUMENT.,"Swept round him, and, bewildered and half-blind,"
3627,ARGUMENT.,"His lips the treasure of her lips did press,"
3628,ARGUMENT.,And round him clung her perfect loveliness.
3629,ARGUMENT.,"For one sweet moment thus they stood, and then"
3630,ARGUMENT.,"She drew herself from out his arms again,"
3631,ARGUMENT.,"And panting, lovelier for her love, did stand"
3632,ARGUMENT.,"Apart awhile, then took her lover's hand,"
3633,ARGUMENT.,"And, in a trembling voice, made haste to say,--"
3634,ARGUMENT.,"""O Ogier, when thou earnest here to-day,"
3635,ARGUMENT.,"I feared indeed, that in my sport with fate,"
3636,ARGUMENT.,"I might have seen thee e'en one day too late,"
3637,ARGUMENT.,Before this ring thy finger should embrace;
3638,ARGUMENT.,"Behold it, love, and thy keen eyes may trace"
3639,ARGUMENT.,Faint figures wrought upon the ruddy gold;
3640,ARGUMENT.,"My father dying gave it me, nor told"
3641,ARGUMENT.,"The manner of its making, but I know"
3642,ARGUMENT.,That it can make thee e'en as thou art now
3643,ARGUMENT.,Despite the laws of God--shrink not from me
3644,ARGUMENT.,Because I give an impious gift to thee--
3645,ARGUMENT.,"Has not God made me also, who do this?"
3646,ARGUMENT.,"But I, who longed to share with thee my bliss,"
3647,ARGUMENT.,"Am of the fays, and live their changeless life,"
3648,ARGUMENT.,"And, like the gods of old, I see the strife"
3649,ARGUMENT.,"That moves the world, unmoved if so I will;"
3650,ARGUMENT.,"For we the fruit, that teaches good and ill,"
3651,ARGUMENT.,Have never touched like you of Adam's race;
3652,ARGUMENT.,And while thou dwellest with me in this place
3653,ARGUMENT.,"Thus shalt thou be--ah, and thou deem'st, indeed,"
3654,ARGUMENT.,That thou shalt gain thereby no happy meed
3655,ARGUMENT.,Reft of the world's joys? nor canst understand
3656,ARGUMENT.,How thou art come into a happy land?--
3657,ARGUMENT.,"Love, in thy world the priests of heaven still sing,"
3658,ARGUMENT.,And tell thee of it many a joyous thing;
3659,ARGUMENT.,"But think'st thou, bearing the world's joy and pain,"
3660,ARGUMENT.,"Thou couldst live there? nay, nay, but born again"
3661,ARGUMENT.,Thus wouldst be happy with the angels' bliss;
3662,ARGUMENT.,"And so with us no otherwise it is,"
3663,ARGUMENT.,Nor hast thou cast thine old life quite away
3664,ARGUMENT.,"Even as yet, though that shall be to-day."
3665,ARGUMENT.,"""But for the love and country thou hast won,"
3666,ARGUMENT.,"Know thou, that thou art come to Avallon,"
3667,ARGUMENT.,"That is both thine and mine; and as for me,"
3668,ARGUMENT.,Morgan le Fay men call me commonly
3669,ARGUMENT.,"Within the world, but fairer names than this"
3670,ARGUMENT.,"I have for thee and me, 'twixt kiss and kiss."""
3671,ARGUMENT.,
3672,ARGUMENT.,"Ah, what was this? and was it all in vain,"
3673,ARGUMENT.,That she had brought him here this life to gain?
3674,ARGUMENT.,"For, ere her speech was done, like one turned blind"
3675,ARGUMENT.,He watched the kisses of the wandering wind
3676,ARGUMENT.,"Within her raiment, or as some one sees"
3677,ARGUMENT.,The very best of well-wrought images
3678,ARGUMENT.,"When he is blind with grief, did he behold"
3679,ARGUMENT.,The wandering tresses of her locks of gold
3680,ARGUMENT.,Upon her shoulders; and no more he pressed
3681,ARGUMENT.,The hand that in his own hand lay at rest:
3682,ARGUMENT.,"His eyes, grown dull with changing memories,"
3683,ARGUMENT.,Could make no answer to her glorious eyes:
3684,ARGUMENT.,"Cold waxed his heart, and weary and distraught,"
3685,ARGUMENT.,"With many a cast-by, hateful, dreary thought,"
3686,ARGUMENT.,Unfinished in the old days; and withal
3687,ARGUMENT.,He needs must think of what might chance to fall
3688,ARGUMENT.,In this life new-begun; and good and bad
3689,ARGUMENT.,"Tormented him, because as yet he had"
3690,ARGUMENT.,"A worldly heart within his frame made new,"
3691,ARGUMENT.,And to the deeds that he was wont to do
3692,ARGUMENT.,Did his desires still turn. But she a while
3693,ARGUMENT.,"Stood gazing at him with a doubtful smile,"
3694,ARGUMENT.,And let his hand fall down; but suddenly
3695,ARGUMENT.,"Sounded sweet music from some close nearby,"
3696,ARGUMENT.,"And then she spoke again: ""Come, love, with me,"
3697,ARGUMENT.,"That thou thy new life and delights mayst see."""
3698,ARGUMENT.,"And gently with that word she led him thence,"
3699,ARGUMENT.,And though upon him now there fell a sense
3700,ARGUMENT.,"Of dreamy and unreal bewilderment,"
3701,ARGUMENT.,"As hand in hand through that green place they went,"
3702,ARGUMENT.,Yet therewithal a strain of tender love
3703,ARGUMENT.,A little yet his restless heart did move.
3704,ARGUMENT.,
3705,ARGUMENT.,*     *     *     *     *
3706,ARGUMENT.,
3707,ARGUMENT.,So through the whispering trees they came at last
3708,ARGUMENT.,To where a wondrous house a shadow cast
3709,ARGUMENT.,"Across the flowers, and o'er the daisied grass"
3710,ARGUMENT.,"Before it, crowds of lovely folk did pass,"
3711,ARGUMENT.,"Playing about in carelessness and mirth,"
3712,ARGUMENT.,Unshadowed by the doubtful deeds of earth;
3713,ARGUMENT.,"And from the midst a band of fair girls came,"
3714,ARGUMENT.,"With flowers and music, greeting him by name,"
3715,ARGUMENT.,And praising him; but ever like a dream
3716,ARGUMENT.,"He could not break, did all to Ogier seem,"
3717,ARGUMENT.,"And he his old world did the more desire,"
3718,ARGUMENT.,"For in his heart still burned unquenched the fire,"
3719,ARGUMENT.,That through the world of old so bright did burn:
3720,ARGUMENT.,"Yet was he fain that kindness to return,"
3721,ARGUMENT.,And from the depth of his full heart he sighed.
3722,ARGUMENT.,Then toward the house the lovely Queen did guide
3723,ARGUMENT.,"His listless steps, and seemed to take no thought"
3724,ARGUMENT.,"Of knitted brow or wandering eyes distraught,"
3725,ARGUMENT.,But still with kind love lighting up her face
3726,ARGUMENT.,"She led him through the door of that fair place,"
3727,ARGUMENT.,While round about them did the damsels press;
3728,ARGUMENT.,And he was moved by all that loveliness
3729,ARGUMENT.,"As one might be, who, lying half asleep"
3730,ARGUMENT.,"In the May morning, notes the light wind sweep"
3731,ARGUMENT.,Over the tulip-beds: no more to him
3732,ARGUMENT.,"Were gleaming eyes, red lips, and bodies slim,"
3733,ARGUMENT.,"Amidst that dream, although the first surprise"
3734,ARGUMENT.,Of hurried love wherewith the Queen's sweet eyes
3735,ARGUMENT.,"Had smitten him, still in his heart did stir."
3736,ARGUMENT.,
3737,ARGUMENT.,"And so at last he came, led on by her"
3738,ARGUMENT.,"Into a hall wherein a fair throne was,"
3739,ARGUMENT.,And hand in hand thereto the twain did pass;
3740,ARGUMENT.,"And there she bade him sit, and when alone"
3741,ARGUMENT.,"He took his place upon the double throne,"
3742,ARGUMENT.,"She cast herself before him on her knees,"
3743,ARGUMENT.,"Embracing his, and greatly did increase"
3744,ARGUMENT.,The shame and love that vexed his troubled heart:
3745,ARGUMENT.,"But now a line of girls the crowd did part,"
3746,ARGUMENT.,"Lovelier than all, and Ogier could behold"
3747,ARGUMENT.,One in their midst who bore a crown of gold
3748,ARGUMENT.,Within her slender hands and delicate;
3749,ARGUMENT.,"She, drawing nigh, beside the throne did wait"
3750,ARGUMENT.,"Until the Queen arose and took the crown,"
3751,ARGUMENT.,Who then to Ogier's lips did stoop adown
3752,ARGUMENT.,"And kissed him, and said, ""Ogier, what were worth"
3753,ARGUMENT.,"Thy miserable days of strife on earth,"
3754,ARGUMENT.,"That on their ashes still thine eyes are turned?"""
3755,ARGUMENT.,"Then, as she spoke these words, his changed heart burned"
3756,ARGUMENT.,"With sudden memories, and thereto had he"
3757,ARGUMENT.,"Made answer, but she raised up suddenly"
3758,ARGUMENT.,"The crown she held and set it on his head,"
3759,ARGUMENT.,"""Ogier,"" she cried, ""those troublous days are dead;"
3760,ARGUMENT.,"Thou wert dead with them also, but for me;"
3761,ARGUMENT.,"Turn unto her who wrought these things for thee!"""
3762,ARGUMENT.,"Then, as he felt her touch, a mighty wave"
3763,ARGUMENT.,"Of love swept o'er his soul, as though the grave"
3764,ARGUMENT.,Did really hold his body; from his seat
3765,ARGUMENT.,He rose to cast himself before her feet;
3766,ARGUMENT.,"But she clung round him, and in close embrace"
3767,ARGUMENT.,The twain were locked amidst that thronging place.
3768,ARGUMENT.,
3769,ARGUMENT.,"Thenceforth new life indeed has Ogier won,"
3770,ARGUMENT.,And in the happy land of Avallon
3771,ARGUMENT.,Quick glide the years o'er his unchanging head;
3772,ARGUMENT.,"There saw he many men the world thought dead,"
3773,ARGUMENT.,Living like him in sweet forgetfulness
3774,ARGUMENT.,Of all the troubles that did once oppress
3775,ARGUMENT.,"Their vainly-struggling lives--ah, how can I"
3776,ARGUMENT.,Tell of their joy as though I had been nigh?
3777,ARGUMENT.,"Suffice it that no fear of death they knew,"
3778,ARGUMENT.,"That there no talk there was of false or true,"
3779,ARGUMENT.,"Of right or wrong, for traitors came not there;"
3780,ARGUMENT.,"That everything was bright and soft and fair,"
3781,ARGUMENT.,"And yet they wearied not for any change,"
3782,ARGUMENT.,Nor unto them did constancy seem strange.
3783,ARGUMENT.,"Love knew they, but its pain they never had,"
3784,ARGUMENT.,But with each other's joy were they made glad;
3785,ARGUMENT.,"Nor were their lives wasted by hidden fire,"
3786,ARGUMENT.,Nor knew they of the unfulfilled desire
3787,ARGUMENT.,"That turns to ashes all the joys of earth,"
3788,ARGUMENT.,Nor knew they yearning love amidst the dearth
3789,ARGUMENT.,"Of kind and loving hearts to spend it on,"
3790,ARGUMENT.,Nor dreamed or discontent when all was won;
3791,ARGUMENT.,Nor need they struggle after wealth and fame;
3792,ARGUMENT.,"Still was the calm flow of their lives the same,"
3793,ARGUMENT.,"And yet, I say, they wearied not of it--"
3794,ARGUMENT.,So did the promised days by Ogier flit.
3795,ARGUMENT.,
3796,ARGUMENT.,"Think that a hundred years have now passed by,"
3797,ARGUMENT.,Since ye beheld Ogier lie down to die
3798,ARGUMENT.,Beside the fountain; think that now ye are
3799,ARGUMENT.,"In France, made dangerous with wasting war;"
3800,ARGUMENT.,"In Paris, where about each guarded gate,"
3801,ARGUMENT.,"Gathered in knots, the anxious people wait,"
3802,ARGUMENT.,And press around each new-come man to learn
3803,ARGUMENT.,"If Harfleur now the pagan wasters burn,"
3804,ARGUMENT.,"Or if the Rouen folk can keep their chain,"
3805,ARGUMENT.,Or Pont de l'Arche unburnt still guards the Seine?
3806,ARGUMENT.,Or if 'tis true that Andelys succour wants?
3807,ARGUMENT.,That Vernon's folk are fleeing east to Mantes?
3808,ARGUMENT.,When will they come? or rather is it true
3809,ARGUMENT.,That a great band the Constable o'erthrew
3810,ARGUMENT.,"Upon the marshes of the lower Seine,"
3811,ARGUMENT.,"And that their long ships, turning back again,"
3812,ARGUMENT.,Caught by the high-raised waters of the bore
3813,ARGUMENT.,Were driven here and there and cast ashore?
3814,ARGUMENT.,"Such questions did they ask, and, as fresh men"
3815,ARGUMENT.,"Came hurrying in, they asked them o'er again,"
3816,ARGUMENT.,"And from scared folk, or fools, or ignorant,"
3817,ARGUMENT.,"Still got new lies, or tidings very scant."
3818,ARGUMENT.,
3819,ARGUMENT.,"But now amidst these men at last came one,"
3820,ARGUMENT.,"A little ere the setting of the sun,"
3821,ARGUMENT.,"With two stout men behind him, armed right well,"
3822,ARGUMENT.,"Who ever as they rode on, sooth to tell,"
3823,ARGUMENT.,"With doubtful eyes upon their master stared,"
3824,ARGUMENT.,Or looked about like troubled men and scared.
3825,ARGUMENT.,And he they served was noteworthy indeed;
3826,ARGUMENT.,"Of ancient fashion were his arms and weed,"
3827,ARGUMENT.,Rich past the wont of men in those sad times;
3828,ARGUMENT.,"His face was bronzed, as though by burning climes,"
3829,ARGUMENT.,But lovely as the image of a god
3830,ARGUMENT.,Carved in the days before on earth Christ trod;
3831,ARGUMENT.,"But solemn were his eyes, and grey as glass,"
3832,ARGUMENT.,And like to ruddy gold his fine hair was:
3833,ARGUMENT.,"A mighty man he was, and taller far"
3834,ARGUMENT.,Than those who on that day must bear the war
3835,ARGUMENT.,The pagans waged: he by the warders stayed
3836,ARGUMENT.,"Scarce looked on them, but straight their words obeyed"
3837,ARGUMENT.,"And showed his pass; then, asked about his name"
3838,ARGUMENT.,"And from what city of the world he came,"
3839,ARGUMENT.,"Said, that men called him now the Ancient Knight,"
3840,ARGUMENT.,That he was come midst the king's men to fight
3841,ARGUMENT.,"From St. Omer's; and as he spoke, he gazed"
3842,ARGUMENT.,"Down on the thronging street as one amazed,"
3843,ARGUMENT.,And answered no more to the questioning
3844,ARGUMENT.,Of frightened folk of this or that sad thing;
3845,ARGUMENT.,"But, ere he passed on, turned about at last"
3846,ARGUMENT.,"And on the wondering guard a strange look cast,"
3847,ARGUMENT.,"And said, ""St. Mary! do such men as ye"
3848,ARGUMENT.,Fight with the wasters from across the sea?
3849,ARGUMENT.,"Then, certes, are ye lost, however good"
3850,ARGUMENT.,Your hearts may be; not such were those who stood
3851,ARGUMENT.,"Beside the Hammer-bearer years agone."""
3852,ARGUMENT.,"So said he, and as his fair armour shone"
3853,ARGUMENT.,"With beauty of a time long passed away,"
3854,ARGUMENT.,So with the music of another day
3855,ARGUMENT.,"His deep voice thrilled the awe-struck, listening folk."
3856,ARGUMENT.,
3857,ARGUMENT.,"Yet from the crowd a mocking voice outbroke,"
3858,ARGUMENT.,"That cried, ""Be merry, masters, fear ye nought,"
3859,ARGUMENT.,Surely good succour to our side is brought;
3860,ARGUMENT.,For here is Charlemaine come off his tomb
3861,ARGUMENT.,"To save his faithful city from its doom."""
3862,ARGUMENT.,"""Yea,"" said another, ""this is certain news,"
3863,ARGUMENT.,Surely ye know how all the carvers use
3864,ARGUMENT.,"To carve the dead man's image at the best,"
3865,ARGUMENT.,That guards the place where he may lie at rest;
3866,ARGUMENT.,"Wherefore this living image looks indeed,"
3867,ARGUMENT.,"Spite of his ancient tongue and marvellous weed,"
3868,ARGUMENT.,"To have but thirty summers."""
3869,ARGUMENT.,At the name
3870,ARGUMENT.,"Of Charlemaine, he turned to whence there came"
3871,ARGUMENT.,"The mocking voice, and somewhat knit his brow,"
3872,ARGUMENT.,"And seemed as he would speak, but scarce knew how;"
3873,ARGUMENT.,So with a half-sigh soon sank back again
3874,ARGUMENT.,"Into his dream, and shook his well-wrought rein,"
3875,ARGUMENT.,And silently went on upon his way.
3876,ARGUMENT.,
3877,ARGUMENT.,And this was Ogier: on what evil day
3878,ARGUMENT.,"Has he then stumbled, that he needs must come,"
3879,ARGUMENT.,"Midst war and ravage, to the ancient home"
3880,ARGUMENT.,"Of his desires? did he grow weary then,"
3881,ARGUMENT.,And wish to strive once more with foolish men
3882,ARGUMENT.,For worthless things? or is fair Avallon
3883,ARGUMENT.,"Sunk in the sea, and all that glory gone?"
3884,ARGUMENT.,"Nay, thus it happed--One day she came to him"
3885,ARGUMENT.,"And said, ""Ogier, thy name is waxen dim"
3886,ARGUMENT.,Upon the world that thou rememberest not;
3887,ARGUMENT.,The heathen men are thick on many a spot
3888,ARGUMENT.,"Thine eyes have seen, and which I love therefore;"
3889,ARGUMENT.,And God will give His wonted help no more.
3890,ARGUMENT.,"Wilt thou, then, help? canst thou have any mind"
3891,ARGUMENT.,To give thy banner once more to the wind?
3892,ARGUMENT.,Since greater glory thou shalt win for this
3893,ARGUMENT.,Than erst thou gatheredst ere thou cam'st to bliss:
3894,ARGUMENT.,"For men are dwindled both in heart and frame,"
3895,ARGUMENT.,Nor holds the fair land any such a name
3896,ARGUMENT.,"As thine, when thou wert living midst thy peers:"
3897,ARGUMENT.,"The world is worser for these hundred years."""
3898,ARGUMENT.,"From his calm eyes there gleamed a little fire,"
3899,ARGUMENT.,"And in his voice was something of desire,"
3900,ARGUMENT.,"To see the land where he was used to be,"
3901,ARGUMENT.,"As now he answered: ""Nay, choose thou for me,"
3902,ARGUMENT.,Thou art the wisest; it is more than well
3903,ARGUMENT.,Within this peaceful place with thee to dwell:
3904,ARGUMENT.,"Nor ill perchance in that old land to die,"
3905,ARGUMENT.,"If, dying, I keep not the memory"
3906,ARGUMENT.,"Of this fair life of ours."" ""Nay, nay,"" said she,"
3907,ARGUMENT.,"""As to thy dying, that shall never be,"
3908,ARGUMENT.,"Whiles that thou keep'st my ring--and now, behold,"
3909,ARGUMENT.,"I take from thee thy charmed crown of gold,"
3910,ARGUMENT.,And thou wilt be the Ogier that thou wast
3911,ARGUMENT.,Ere on the loadstone rock thy ship was cast:
3912,ARGUMENT.,"Yet thou shalt have thy youthful body still,"
3913,ARGUMENT.,"And I will guard thy life from every ill."""
3914,ARGUMENT.,
3915,ARGUMENT.,"So was it done, and Ogier, armed right well,"
3916,ARGUMENT.,"Sleeping, was borne away by some strong spell,"
3917,ARGUMENT.,And set upon the Flemish coast; and thence
3918,ARGUMENT.,"Turned to St. Omer's, with a doubtful sense"
3919,ARGUMENT.,"Of being in some wild dream, the while he knew"
3920,ARGUMENT.,"That great delight forgotten was his due,"
3921,ARGUMENT.,That all which there might hap was of small worth.
3922,ARGUMENT.,"So on he went, and sometimes unto mirth"
3923,ARGUMENT.,"Did his attire move the country-folk,"
3924,ARGUMENT.,But oftener when strange speeches from him broke
3925,ARGUMENT.,"Concerning men and things for long years dead,"
3926,ARGUMENT.,He filled the listeners with great awe and dread;
3927,ARGUMENT.,For in such wild times as these people were
3928,ARGUMENT.,Are men soon moved to wonder and to fear.
3929,ARGUMENT.,
3930,ARGUMENT.,"Now through the streets of Paris did he ride,"
3931,ARGUMENT.,And at a certain hostel did abide
3932,ARGUMENT.,"Throughout that night, and ere he went next day"
3933,ARGUMENT.,"He saw a book that on a table lay,"
3934,ARGUMENT.,And opening it 'gan read in lazy mood:
3935,ARGUMENT.,"But long before it in that place he stood,"
3936,ARGUMENT.,Noting nought else; for it did chronicle
3937,ARGUMENT.,"The deeds of men of old he knew right well,"
3938,ARGUMENT.,When they were living in the flesh with him:
3939,ARGUMENT.,"Yea, his own deeds he saw, grown strange and dim"
3940,ARGUMENT.,"Already, and true stories mixed with lies,"
3941,ARGUMENT.,"Until, with many thronging memories"
3942,ARGUMENT.,"Of those old days, his heart was so oppressed,"
3943,ARGUMENT.,"He 'gan to wish that he might lie at rest,"
3944,ARGUMENT.,Forgetting all things: for indeed by this
3945,ARGUMENT.,Little remembrance had he of the bliss
3946,ARGUMENT.,That wrapped his soul in peaceful Avallon.
3947,ARGUMENT.,
3948,ARGUMENT.,But his changed life he needs must carry on;
3949,ARGUMENT.,For ye shall know the Queen was gathering men
3950,ARGUMENT.,"To send unto the good King, who as then"
3951,ARGUMENT.,"In Rouen lay, beset by many a band"
3952,ARGUMENT.,"Of those who carried terror through the land,"
3953,ARGUMENT.,And still by messengers for help he prayed:
3954,ARGUMENT.,"Therefore a mighty muster was being made,"
3955,ARGUMENT.,"Of weak and strong, and brave and timorous,"
3956,ARGUMENT.,Before the Queen anigh her royal house.
3957,ARGUMENT.,"So thither on this morn did Ogier turn,"
3958,ARGUMENT.,Some certain news about the war to learn;
3959,ARGUMENT.,"And when he came at last into the square,"
3960,ARGUMENT.,And saw the ancient palace great and fair
3961,ARGUMENT.,"Rise up before him as in other days,"
3962,ARGUMENT.,And in the merry morn the bright sun's rays
3963,ARGUMENT.,"Glittering on gathering helms and moving spears,"
3964,ARGUMENT.,"He 'gan to feel as in the long-past years,"
3965,ARGUMENT.,And his heart stirred within him. Now the Queen
3966,ARGUMENT.,"Came from within, right royally beseen,"
3967,ARGUMENT.,"And took her seat beneath a canopy,"
3968,ARGUMENT.,With lords and captains of the war anigh;
3969,ARGUMENT.,"And as she came a mighty shout arose,"
3970,ARGUMENT.,"And round about began the knights to close,"
3971,ARGUMENT.,"Their oath of fealty there to swear anew,"
3972,ARGUMENT.,And learn what service they had got to do.
3973,ARGUMENT.,"But so it was, that some their shouts must stay"
3974,ARGUMENT.,To gaze at Ogier as he took his way
3975,ARGUMENT.,Through the thronged place; and quickly too he gat
3976,ARGUMENT.,"Unto the place whereas the Lady sat,"
3977,ARGUMENT.,"For men gave place unto him, fearing him:"
3978,ARGUMENT.,"For not alone was he most huge of limb,"
3979,ARGUMENT.,"And dangerous, but something in his face,"
3980,ARGUMENT.,"As his calm eyes looked o'er the crowded place,"
3981,ARGUMENT.,"Struck men with awe; and in the ancient days,"
3982,ARGUMENT.,"When men might hope alive on gods to gaze,"
3983,ARGUMENT.,"They would have thought, ""The gods yet love our town"
3984,ARGUMENT.,"And from the heavens have sent a great one down."""
3985,ARGUMENT.,"Withal unto the throne he came so near,"
3986,ARGUMENT.,That he the Queen's sweet measured voice could hear;
3987,ARGUMENT.,And swiftly now within him wrought the change
3988,ARGUMENT.,That first he felt amid those faces strange;
3989,ARGUMENT.,And his heart burned to taste the hurrying life
3990,ARGUMENT.,"With such desires, such changing sweetness rife."
3991,ARGUMENT.,"And yet, indeed, how should he live alone,"
3992,ARGUMENT.,Who in the old past days such friends had known?
3993,ARGUMENT.,"Then he began to think of Caraheu,"
3994,ARGUMENT.,"Of Bellicent the fair, and once more knew"
3995,ARGUMENT.,The bitter pain of rent and ended love.
3996,ARGUMENT.,"But while with hope and vain regret he strove,"
3997,ARGUMENT.,"He found none 'twixt him and the Queen's high seat,"
3998,ARGUMENT.,"And, stepping forth, he knelt before her feet"
3999,ARGUMENT.,"And took her hand to swear, as was the way"
4000,ARGUMENT.,"Of doing fealty in that ancient day,"
4001,ARGUMENT.,And raised his eyes to hers; as fair was she
4002,ARGUMENT.,As any woman of the world might be
4003,ARGUMENT.,"Full-limbed and tall, dark haired, from her deep eyes,"
4004,ARGUMENT.,"The snare of fools, the ruin of the wise,"
4005,ARGUMENT.,"Love looked unchecked; and now her dainty hand,"
4006,ARGUMENT.,"The well-knit holder of the golden wand,"
4007,ARGUMENT.,"Trembled in his, she cast her eyes adown,"
4008,ARGUMENT.,"And her sweet brow was knitted to a frown,"
4009,ARGUMENT.,"As he, the taker of such oaths of yore,"
4010,ARGUMENT.,"Now unto her all due obedience swore,"
4011,ARGUMENT.,"Yet gave himself no name; and now the Queen,"
4012,ARGUMENT.,"Awed by his voice as other folk had been,"
4013,ARGUMENT.,Yet felt a trembling hope within her rise
4014,ARGUMENT.,"Too sweet to think of, and with love's surprise"
4015,ARGUMENT.,"Her cheek grew pale; she said, ""Thy style and name"
4016,ARGUMENT.,"Thou tellest not, nor what land of thy fame"
4017,ARGUMENT.,"Is glad; for, certes, some land must be glad,"
4018,ARGUMENT.,"That in its bounds her house thy mother had."""
4019,ARGUMENT.,"""Lady,"" he said, ""from what far land I come"
4020,ARGUMENT.,"I well might tell thee, but another home"
4021,ARGUMENT.,"Have I long dwelt in, and its name have I"
4022,ARGUMENT.,"Forgotten now, forgotten utterly"
4023,ARGUMENT.,"Who were my fellows, and what deeds they did;"
4024,ARGUMENT.,"Therefore, indeed, shall my first name be hid"
4025,ARGUMENT.,And my first country; call me on this day
4026,ARGUMENT.,"The Ancient Knight, and let me go my way."""
4027,ARGUMENT.,"He rose withal, for she her fingers fair"
4028,ARGUMENT.,"Had drawn aback, and on him 'gan to stare"
4029,ARGUMENT.,As one afeard; for something terrible
4030,ARGUMENT.,"Was in his speech, and that she knew right well,"
4031,ARGUMENT.,"Who 'gan to love him, and to fear that she,"
4032,ARGUMENT.,"Shut out by some strange deadly mystery,"
4033,ARGUMENT.,Should never gain from him an equal love;
4034,ARGUMENT.,"Yet, as from her high seat he 'gan to move,"
4035,ARGUMENT.,"She said, ""O Ancient Knight, come presently,"
4036,ARGUMENT.,"When we have done this muster, unto me,"
4037,ARGUMENT.,And thou shalt have thy charge and due command
4038,ARGUMENT.,"For freeing from our foes this wretched land!"""
4039,ARGUMENT.,"Then Ogier made his reverence and went,"
4040,ARGUMENT.,And somewhat could perceive of her intent;
4041,ARGUMENT.,"For in his heart life grew, and love with life"
4042,ARGUMENT.,"Grew, and therewith, 'twixt love and fame, was strife."
4043,ARGUMENT.,"But, as he slowly gat him from the square,"
4044,ARGUMENT.,"Gazing at all the people gathered there,"
4045,ARGUMENT.,"A squire of the Queen's behind him came,"
4046,ARGUMENT.,"And breathless, called him by his new-coined name,"
4047,ARGUMENT.,"And bade him turn because the Queen now bade,"
4048,ARGUMENT.,"Since by the muster long she might be stayed,"
4049,ARGUMENT.,"That to the palace he should bring him straight,"
4050,ARGUMENT.,Midst sport and play her coming back to wait;
4051,ARGUMENT.,"Then Ogier turned, nought loath, and with him went,"
4052,ARGUMENT.,"And to a postern-gate his steps he bent,"
4053,ARGUMENT.,That Ogier knew right well in days of old;
4054,ARGUMENT.,"Worn was it now, and the bright hues and gold"
4055,ARGUMENT.,"Upon the shields above, with lapse of days,"
4056,ARGUMENT.,Were faded much: but now did Ogier gaze
4057,ARGUMENT.,"Upon the garden where he walked of yore,"
4058,ARGUMENT.,Holding the hands that he should see no more;
4059,ARGUMENT.,"For all was changed except the palace fair,"
4060,ARGUMENT.,That Charlemaine's own eyes had seen built there
4061,ARGUMENT.,Ere Ogier knew him; there the squire did lead
4062,ARGUMENT.,"The Ancient Knight, who still took little heed"
4063,ARGUMENT.,"Of all the things that by the way he said,"
4064,ARGUMENT.,For all his thoughts were on the days long dead.
4065,ARGUMENT.,"There in the painted hall he sat again,"
4066,ARGUMENT.,And 'neath the pictured eyes of Charlemaine
4067,ARGUMENT.,"He ate and drank, and felt it like a dream;"
4068,ARGUMENT.,And midst his growing longings yet might deem
4069,ARGUMENT.,That he from sleep should wake up presently
4070,ARGUMENT.,"In some fair city on the Syrian sea,"
4071,ARGUMENT.,Or on the brown rocks of the loadstone isle.
4072,ARGUMENT.,"But fain to be alone, within a while"
4073,ARGUMENT.,"He gat him to the garden, and there passed"
4074,ARGUMENT.,"By wondering squires and damsels, till at last,"
4075,ARGUMENT.,"Far from the merry folk who needs must play,"
4076,ARGUMENT.,"If on the world were coming its last day,"
4077,ARGUMENT.,"He sat him down, and through his mind there ran"
4078,ARGUMENT.,"Faint thoughts of that day, when, outworn and wan,"
4079,ARGUMENT.,He lay down by the fountain-side to die.
4080,ARGUMENT.,But when he strove to gain clear memory
4081,ARGUMENT.,Of what had happed since on the isle he lay
4082,ARGUMENT.,"Waiting for death, a hopeless castaway,"
4083,ARGUMENT.,"Thought failing him, would rather bring again"
4084,ARGUMENT.,"His life among the peers of Charlemaine,"
4085,ARGUMENT.,And vex his soul with hapless memories;
4086,ARGUMENT.,"Until at last, worn out by thought of these,"
4087,ARGUMENT.,"And hopeless striving to find what was true,"
4088,ARGUMENT.,And pondering on the deeds he had to do
4089,ARGUMENT.,"Ere he returned, whereto he could not tell,"
4090,ARGUMENT.,Sweet sleep upon his wearied spirit fell.
4091,ARGUMENT.,"And on the afternoon of that fair day,"
4092,ARGUMENT.,"Forgetting all, beneath the trees he lay."
4093,ARGUMENT.,
4094,ARGUMENT.,"Meanwhile the Queen, affairs of state being done,"
4095,ARGUMENT.,Went through the gardens with one dame alone
4096,ARGUMENT.,"Seeking for Ogier, whom at last she found"
4097,ARGUMENT.,"Laid sleeping on the daisy-sprinkled ground,"
4098,ARGUMENT.,"Dreaming, I know not what, of other days."
4099,ARGUMENT.,"Then on him for a while the Queen did gaze,"
4100,ARGUMENT.,"Drawing sweet poison from the lovely sight,"
4101,ARGUMENT.,"Then to her fellow turned, ""The ancient Knight--"
4102,ARGUMENT.,"What means he by this word of his?"" she said;"
4103,ARGUMENT.,"""He were well mated with some lovely maid"
4104,ARGUMENT.,"Just pondering on the late-heard name of love."""
4105,ARGUMENT.,"""Softly, my lady, he begins to move,"""
4106,ARGUMENT.,"Her fellow said, a woman old and grey;"
4107,ARGUMENT.,"""Look now, his arms are of another day;"
4108,ARGUMENT.,None know him or his deeds; thy squire just said
4109,ARGUMENT.,He asked about the state of men long dead;
4110,ARGUMENT.,"I fear what he may be; look, seest thou not"
4111,ARGUMENT.,"That ring that on one finger he has got,"
4112,ARGUMENT.,Where figures strange upon the gold are wrought:
4113,ARGUMENT.,God grant that he from hell has not been brought
4114,ARGUMENT.,"For our confusion, in this doleful war,"
4115,ARGUMENT.,Who surely in enough of trouble are
4116,ARGUMENT.,"Without such help;"" then the Queen turned aside"
4117,ARGUMENT.,"Awhile, her drawn and troubled face to hide,"
4118,ARGUMENT.,For lurking dread this speech within her stirred;
4119,ARGUMENT.,"But yet she said, ""Thou sayest a foolish word,"
4120,ARGUMENT.,This man is come against our enemies
4121,ARGUMENT.,"To fight for us."" Then down upon her knees"
4122,ARGUMENT.,"Fell the old woman by the sleeping knight,"
4123,ARGUMENT.,And from his hand she drew with fingers light
4124,ARGUMENT.,"The wondrous ring, and scarce again could rise"
4125,ARGUMENT.,Ere 'neath the trembling Queen's bewildered eyes
4126,ARGUMENT.,"The change began; his golden hair turned white,"
4127,ARGUMENT.,"His smooth cheek wrinkled, and his breathing light"
4128,ARGUMENT.,"Was turned to troublous struggling for his breath,"
4129,ARGUMENT.,And on his shrunk lips lay the hand of death;
4130,ARGUMENT.,"And, scarce less pale than he, the trembling Queen"
4131,ARGUMENT.,Stood thinking on the beauty she had seen
4132,ARGUMENT.,"And longed for but a little while ago,"
4133,ARGUMENT.,"Yet with her terror still her love did grow,"
4134,ARGUMENT.,And she began to weep as though she saw
4135,ARGUMENT.,Her beauty e'en to such an ending draw.
4136,ARGUMENT.,"And 'neath her tears waking he oped his eyes,"
4137,ARGUMENT.,"And strove to speak, but nought but gasping sighs"
4138,ARGUMENT.,His lips could utter; then he tried to reach
4139,ARGUMENT.,"His hand to them, as though he would beseech"
4140,ARGUMENT.,The gift of what was his: but all the while
4141,ARGUMENT.,"The crone gazed on them with an evil smile,"
4142,ARGUMENT.,"Then holding toward the Queen that wondrous ring,"
4143,ARGUMENT.,"She said, ""Why weep'st thou? having this fair thing,"
4144,ARGUMENT.,"Thou, losing nought the beauty that thou hast,"
4145,ARGUMENT.,"May'st watch the vainly struggling world go past,"
4146,ARGUMENT.,"Thyself unchanged."" The Queen put forth her hand"
4147,ARGUMENT.,"And took the ring, and there awhile did stand"
4148,ARGUMENT.,"And strove to think of it, but still in her"
4149,ARGUMENT.,"Such all-absorbing longings love did stir,"
4150,ARGUMENT.,"So young she was, of death she could not think,"
4151,ARGUMENT.,Or what a cup eld gives to man to drink;
4152,ARGUMENT.,Yet on her finger had she set the ring
4153,ARGUMENT.,When now the life that hitherto did cling
4154,ARGUMENT.,"To Ogier's heart seemed fading quite away,"
4155,ARGUMENT.,And scarcely breathing with shut eyes he lay.
4156,ARGUMENT.,"Then, kneeling down, she murmured piteously,"
4157,ARGUMENT.,"""Ah, wilt thou love me if I give it thee,"
4158,ARGUMENT.,And thou grow'st young again? what should I do
4159,ARGUMENT.,If with the eyes thou thus shalt gain anew
4160,ARGUMENT.,"Thou shouldst look scorn on me?"" But with that word"
4161,ARGUMENT.,"The hedge behind her, by the west wind stirred,"
4162,ARGUMENT.,"Cast fear into her heart of some one nigh,"
4163,ARGUMENT.,And therewith on his finger hastily
4164,ARGUMENT.,"She set the ring, then rose and stood apart"
4165,ARGUMENT.,"A little way, and in her doubtful heart"
4166,ARGUMENT.,With love and fear was mixed desire of life.
4167,ARGUMENT.,"But standing so, a look with great scorn rife"
4168,ARGUMENT.,"The elder woman, turning, cast on her,"
4169,ARGUMENT.,"Pointing to Ogier, who began to stir;"
4170,ARGUMENT.,"She looked, and all she erst saw now did seem"
4171,ARGUMENT.,"To have been nothing but a hideous dream,"
4172,ARGUMENT.,As fair and young he rose from off the ground
4173,ARGUMENT.,"And cast a dazed and puzzled look around,"
4174,ARGUMENT.,Like one just waked from sleep in some strange place;
4175,ARGUMENT.,"But soon his grave eyes rested on her face,"
4176,ARGUMENT.,"And turned yet graver seeing her so pale,"
4177,ARGUMENT.,And that her eyes were pregnant with some tale
4178,ARGUMENT.,Of love and fear; she 'neath his eyes the while
4179,ARGUMENT.,"Forced her pale lips to semblance of a smile,"
4180,ARGUMENT.,"And said, ""O Ancient Knight, thou sleepest then?"
4181,ARGUMENT.,"While through this poor land range the heathen men,"
4182,ARGUMENT.,Unmet of any but my King and Lord:
4183,ARGUMENT.,"Nay, let us see the deeds of thine old sword."""
4184,ARGUMENT.,"""Queen,"" said he, ""bid me then unto this work,"
4185,ARGUMENT.,"And certes I behind no wall would lurk,"
4186,ARGUMENT.,"Nor send for succour, while a scanty folk"
4187,ARGUMENT.,Still followed after me to break the yoke:
4188,ARGUMENT.,"I pray thee grace for sleeping, and were fain"
4189,ARGUMENT.,That I might rather never sleep again
4190,ARGUMENT.,Than have such wretched dreams as I e'en now
4191,ARGUMENT.,"Have waked from."""
4192,ARGUMENT.,Lovelier she seemed to grow
4193,ARGUMENT.,Unto him as he spoke; fresh colour came
4194,ARGUMENT.,"Into her face, as though for some sweet shame,"
4195,ARGUMENT.,"While she with tearful eyes beheld him so,"
4196,ARGUMENT.,"That somewhat even must his burnt cheek glow,"
4197,ARGUMENT.,"His heart beat faster. But again she said,"
4198,ARGUMENT.,"""Nay, will dreams burden such a mighty head?"
4199,ARGUMENT.,Then may I too have pardon for a dream:
4200,ARGUMENT.,"Last night in sleep I saw thee, who didst seem"
4201,ARGUMENT.,To be the King of France; and thou and I
4202,ARGUMENT.,Were sitting at some great festivity
4203,ARGUMENT.,"Within the many-peopled gold-hung place."""
4204,ARGUMENT.,The blush of shame was gone as on his face
4205,ARGUMENT.,"She gazed, and saw him read her meaning clear"
4206,ARGUMENT.,"And knew that no cold words she had to fear,"
4207,ARGUMENT.,But rather that for softer speech he yearned.
4208,ARGUMENT.,"Therefore, with love alone her smooth cheek burned;"
4209,ARGUMENT.,"Her parted lips were hungry for his kiss,"
4210,ARGUMENT.,She trembled at the near approaching bliss;
4211,ARGUMENT.,"Nathless, she checked her love a little while,"
4212,ARGUMENT.,Because she felt the old dame's curious smile
4213,ARGUMENT.,"Upon her, and she said, ""O Ancient Knight,"
4214,ARGUMENT.,"If I then read my last night's dream aright,"
4215,ARGUMENT.,"Thou art come here our very help to be,"
4216,ARGUMENT.,Perchance to give my husband back to me;
4217,ARGUMENT.,"Come then, if thou this land art fain to save,"
4218,ARGUMENT.,And show the wisdom thou must surely have
4219,ARGUMENT.,Unto my council; I will give thee then
4220,ARGUMENT.,What charge I may among my valiant men;
4221,ARGUMENT.,"And certes thou wilt do so well herein,"
4222,ARGUMENT.,"That, ere long, something greater shalt thou win:"
4223,ARGUMENT.,"Come, then, deliverer of my throne and land,"
4224,ARGUMENT.,And let me touch for once thy mighty hand
4225,ARGUMENT.,"With these weak fingers."""
4226,ARGUMENT.,"As she spoke, she met"
4227,ARGUMENT.,"His eager hand, and all things did forget"
4228,ARGUMENT.,"But for one moment, for too wise were they"
4229,ARGUMENT.,To cast the coming years of joy away;
4230,ARGUMENT.,Then with her other hand her gown she raised
4231,ARGUMENT.,"And led him thence, and o'er her shoulder gazed"
4232,ARGUMENT.,"At her old follower with a doubtful smile,"
4233,ARGUMENT.,"As though to say, ""Be wise, I know thy guile!"""
4234,ARGUMENT.,"But slowly she behind the lovers walked,"
4235,ARGUMENT.,"Muttering, ""So be it! thou shalt not be balked"
4236,ARGUMENT.,"Of thy desire; be merry! I am wise,"
4237,ARGUMENT.,Nor will I rob thee of thy Paradise
4238,ARGUMENT.,For any other than myself; and thou
4239,ARGUMENT.,May'st even happen to have had enow
4240,ARGUMENT.,"Of this new love, before I get the ring,"
4241,ARGUMENT.,"And I may work for thee no evil thing."""

4320,ILLE.,And o'er him 'gan forgetfulness to creep
4321,ILLE.,"Till in the growing light he lay asleep,"
4322,ILLE.,Nor woke until the clanging trumpet-blast
4323,ILLE.,Had summoned him all thought away to cast:
4324,ILLE.,Yet one more joy of love indeed he had
4325,ILLE.,Ere with the battle's noise he was made glad;
4326,ILLE.,"For, as on that May morning forth they rode"
4327,ILLE.,"And passed before the Queen's most fair abode,"
4328,ILLE.,There at a window was she waiting them
4329,ILLE.,"In fair attire with gold in every hem,"
4330,ILLE.,And as the ancient Knight beneath her passed
4331,ILLE.,"A wreath of flowering white-thorn down she cast,"
4332,ILLE.,"And looked farewell to him, and forth he set"
4333,ILLE.,Thinking of all the pleasure he should get
4334,ILLE.,"From love and war, forgetting Avallon"
4335,ILLE.,And all that lovely life so lightly won;
4336,ILLE.,"Yea, now indeed the earthly life o'erpast"
4337,ILLE.,Ere on the loadstone rock his ship was cast
4338,ILLE.,"Was waxing dim, nor yet at all he learned"
4339,ILLE.,To 'scape the fire that erst his heart had burned.
4340,ILLE.,"And he forgat his deeds, forgat his fame,"
4341,ILLE.,Forgat the letters of his ancient name
4342,ILLE.,"As one waked fully shall forget a dream,"
4343,ILLE.,That once to him a wondrous tale did seem.
4344,ILLE.,
4345,ILLE.,"Now I, though writing here no chronicle"
4346,ILLE.,"E'en as I said, must nathless shortly tell"
4347,ILLE.,"That, ere the army Rouen's gates could gain"
4348,ILLE.,"By a broad arrow had the King been slain,"
4349,ILLE.,And helpless now the wretched country lay
4350,ILLE.,"Beneath the yoke, until the glorious day"
4351,ILLE.,"When Ogier fell at last upon the foe,"
4352,ILLE.,And scattered them as helplessly as though
4353,ILLE.,They had been beaten men without a name:
4354,ILLE.,So when to Paris town once more he came
4355,ILLE.,Few folk the memory of the King did keep
4356,ILLE.,"Within their hearts, and if the folk did weep"
4357,ILLE.,"At his returning, 'twas for joy indeed"
4358,ILLE.,That such a man had risen at their need
4359,ILLE.,"To work for them so great deliverance,"
4360,ILLE.,And loud they called on him for King of France.
4361,ILLE.,
4362,ILLE.,But if the Queen's heart were the more a-flame
4363,ILLE.,"For all that she had heard of his great fame,"
4364,ILLE.,I know not; rather with some hidden dread
4365,ILLE.,"Of coming fate, she heard her lord was dead,"
4366,ILLE.,"And her false dream seemed coming true at last,"
4367,ILLE.,For the clear sky of love seemed overcast
4368,ILLE.,"With clouds of God's great judgments, and the fear"
4369,ILLE.,Of hate and final parting drawing near.
4370,ILLE.,So now when he before her throne did stand
4371,ILLE.,"Amidst the throng as saviour of the land,"
4372,ILLE.,"And she her eyes to his kind eyes did raise,"
4373,ILLE.,And there before all her own love must praise;
4374,ILLE.,"Then did she fall a-weeping, and folk said,"
4375,ILLE.,"""See, how she sorrows for the newly dead!"
4376,ILLE.,Amidst our joy she needs must think of him;
4377,ILLE.,"Let be, full surely shall her grief wax dim"
4378,ILLE.,"And she shall wed again."""
4379,ILLE.,"So passed the year,"
4380,ILLE.,While Ogier set himself the land to clear
4381,ILLE.,"Of broken remnants of the heathen men,"
4382,ILLE.,"And at the last, when May-time came again,"
4383,ILLE.,"Must he be crowned King of the twice-saved land,"
4384,ILLE.,And at the altar take the fair Queen's hand
4385,ILLE.,And wed her for his own. And now by this
4386,ILLE.,Had he forgotten clean the woe and bliss
4387,ILLE.,"Of his old life, and still was he made glad"
4388,ILLE.,As other men; and hopes and fears he had
4389,ILLE.,"As others, and bethought him not at all"
4390,ILLE.,Of what strange days upon him yet should fall
4391,ILLE.,When he should live and these again be dead.
4392,ILLE.,
4393,ILLE.,"Now drew the time round when he should be wed,"
4394,ILLE.,And in his palace on his bed he lay
4395,ILLE.,Upon the dawning of the very day:
4396,ILLE.,"'Twixt sleep and waking was he, and could hear"
4397,ILLE.,"E'en at that hour, through the bright morn and clear,"
4398,ILLE.,The hammering of the folk who toiled to make
4399,ILLE.,"Some well-wrought stages for the pageant's sake,"
4400,ILLE.,Though hardly yet the sparrows had begun
4401,ILLE.,"To twitter o'er the coming of the sun,"
4402,ILLE.,Nor through the palace did a creature move.
4403,ILLE.,There in the sweet entanglement of love
4404,ILLE.,"Midst languid thoughts of greater bliss he lay,"
4405,ILLE.,Remembering no more of that other day
4406,ILLE.,"Than the hot noon remembereth of the night,"
4407,ILLE.,Than summer thinketh of the winter white.
4408,ILLE.,"In that sweet hour he heard a voice that cried,"
4409,ILLE.,"""Ogier, Ogier!"" then, opening his eyes wide,"
4410,ILLE.,"And rising on his elbow, gazed around,"
4411,ILLE.,And strange to him and empty was the sound
4412,ILLE.,"Of his own name; ""Whom callest thou?"" he said."
4413,ILLE.,"""For I, the man who lies upon this bed,"
4414,ILLE.,"Am Charles of France, and shall be King to-day,"
4415,ILLE.,But in a year that now is past away
4416,ILLE.,"The Ancient Knight they called me: who is this,"
4417,ILLE.,"Thou callest Ogier, then, what deeds are his?"
4418,ILLE.,"And who art thou?"" But at that word a sigh,"
4419,ILLE.,"As of one grieved, came from some place anigh"
4420,ILLE.,"His bed-side, and a soft voice spake again,"
4421,ILLE.,"""This Ogier once was great amongst great men;"
4422,ILLE.,To Italy a helpless hostage led;
4423,ILLE.,"He saved the King when the false Lombard fled,"
4424,ILLE.,Bore forth the Oriflamme and gained the day;
4425,ILLE.,"Charlot he brought back, whom men led away,"
4426,ILLE.,And fought a day-long fight with Caraheu.
4427,ILLE.,The ravager of Rome his right hand slew;
4428,ILLE.,"Nor did he fear the might of Charlemaine,"
4429,ILLE.,Who for a dreary year beset in vain
4430,ILLE.,"His lonely castle; yet at last caught then,"
4431,ILLE.,"And shut in hold, needs must he come again"
4432,ILLE.,To give an unhoped great deliverance
4433,ILLE.,Unto the burdened helpless land of France:
4434,ILLE.,"Denmark he gained thereafter, and he wore"
4435,ILLE.,The crown of England drawn from trouble sore;
4436,ILLE.,"At Tyre then he reigned, and Babylon"
4437,ILLE.,With mighty deeds he from the foemen won;
4438,ILLE.,"And when scarce aught could give him greater fame,"
4439,ILLE.,He left the world still thinking on his name.
4440,ILLE.,"""These things did Ogier, and these things didst thou,"
4441,ILLE.,Nor will I call thee by a new name now
4442,ILLE.,Since I have spoken words of love to thee--
4443,ILLE.,"Ogier, Ogier, dost thou remember me,"
4444,ILLE.,E'en if thou hast no thought of that past time
4445,ILLE.,"Before thou earnest to our happy clime?"""
4446,ILLE.,
4447,ILLE.,"As this was said, his mazed eyes saw indeed"
4448,ILLE.,A lovely woman clad in dainty weed
4449,ILLE.,"Beside his bed, and many a thought was stirred"
4450,ILLE.,"Within his heart by that last plaintive word,"
4451,ILLE.,"Though nought he said, but waited what should come."
4452,ILLE.,"""Love,"" said she, ""I am here to bring thee home;"
4453,ILLE.,"Well hast thou done all that thou cam'st to do,"
4454,ILLE.,"And if thou bidest here, for something new"
4455,ILLE.,"Will folk begin to cry, and all thy fame"
4456,ILLE.,Shall then avail thee but for greater blame;
4457,ILLE.,"Thy love shall cease to love thee, and the earth"
4458,ILLE.,Thou lovest now shall be of little worth
4459,ILLE.,"While still thou keepest life, abhorring it."
4460,ILLE.,"Behold, in men's lives that so quickly flit"
4461,ILLE.,"Thus is it, how then shall it be with thee,"
4462,ILLE.,Who some faint image of eternity
4463,ILLE.,"Hast gained through me?--alas, thou heedest not!"
4464,ILLE.,On all these changing things thine heart is hot--
4465,ILLE.,"Take then this gift that I have brought from far,"
4466,ILLE.,And then may'st thou remember what we are;
4467,ILLE.,"The lover and the loved from long ago."""
4468,ILLE.,"He trembled, and more memory seemed to grow"
4469,ILLE.,"Within his heart as he beheld her stand,"
4470,ILLE.,Holding a glittering crown in her right hand:
4471,ILLE.,"""Ogier,"" she said, ""arise and do on thee"
4472,ILLE.,"The emblems of thy worldly sovereignity,"
4473,ILLE.,"For we must pass o'er many a sea this morn."""
4474,ILLE.,"He rose, and in the glittering tunic worn"
4475,ILLE.,"By Charlemaine he clad himself, and took"
4476,ILLE.,"The ivory hand, that Charlemaine once shook"
4477,ILLE.,Over the people's head in days of old;
4478,ILLE.,"Then on his feet he set the shoes of gold,"
4479,ILLE.,"And o'er his shoulders threw the mantle fair,"
4480,ILLE.,And set the gold crown on his golden hair:
4481,ILLE.,"Then on the royal chair he sat him down,"
4482,ILLE.,As though he deemed the elders of the town
4483,ILLE.,Should come to audience; and in all he seemed
4484,ILLE.,To do these things e'en as a man who dreamed.
4485,ILLE.,
4486,ILLE.,And now adown the Seine the golden sun
4487,ILLE.,"Shone out, as toward him drew that lovely one"
4488,ILLE.,"And took from off his head the royal crown,"
4489,ILLE.,"And, smiling, on the pillow laid it down"
4490,ILLE.,"And said, ""Lie there, O crown of Charlemaine,"
4491,ILLE.,"Worn by a mighty man, and worn in vain,"
4492,ILLE.,"Because he died, and all the things he did"
4493,ILLE.,Were changed before his face by earth was hid;
4494,ILLE.,"A better crown I have for my love's head,"
4495,ILLE.,"Whereby he yet shall live, when all are dead"
4496,ILLE.,"His hand has helped."" Then on his head she set"
4497,ILLE.,"The wondrous crown, and said, ""Forget, forget!"
4498,ILLE.,"Forget these weary things, for thou hast much"
4499,ILLE.,"Of happiness to think of."""
4500,ILLE.,At that touch
4501,ILLE.,"He rose, a happy light gleamed in his eyes;"
4502,ILLE.,"And smitten by the rush of memories,"
4503,ILLE.,"He stammered out, ""O love! how came we here?"
4504,ILLE.,What do we in this land of Death and Fear?
4505,ILLE.,Have I not been from thee a weary while?
4506,ILLE.,Let us return--I dreamed about the isle;
4507,ILLE.,"I dreamed of other years of strife and pain,"
4508,ILLE.,"Of new years full of struggles long and vain."""
4509,ILLE.,"She took him by the hand and said, ""Come, love,"
4510,ILLE.,"I am not changed;"" and therewith did they move"
4511,ILLE.,"Unto the door, and through the sleeping place"
4512,ILLE.,"Swiftly they went, and still was Ogier's face"
4513,ILLE.,"Turned on her beauty, and no thought was his"
4514,ILLE.,Except the dear returning of his bliss.
4515,ILLE.,But at the threshold of the palace-gate
4516,ILLE.,"That opened to them, she awhile did wait,"
4517,ILLE.,And turned her eyes unto the rippling Seine
4518,ILLE.,"And said, ""O love, behold it once again!"""
4519,ILLE.,"He turned, and gazed upon the city grey"
4520,ILLE.,Smit by the gold of that sweet morn of May;
4521,ILLE.,He heard faint noises as of wakening folk
4522,ILLE.,As on their heads his day of glory broke;
4523,ILLE.,He heard the changing rush of the swift stream
4524,ILLE.,Against the bridge-piers. All was grown a dream.
4525,ILLE.,"His work was over, his reward was come,"
4526,ILLE.,Why should he loiter longer from his home?
4527,ILLE.,
4528,ILLE.,"A little while she watched him silently,"
4529,ILLE.,"Then beckoned him to follow with a sigh,"
4530,ILLE.,"And, raising up the raiment from her feet,"
4531,ILLE.,Across the threshold stepped into the street;
4532,ILLE.,"One moment on the twain the low sun shone,"
4533,ILLE.,"And then the place was void, and they were gone"
4534,ILLE.,"How I know not; but this I know indeed,"
4535,ILLE.,That in whatso great trouble or sore need
4536,ILLE.,"The land of France since that fair day has been,"
4537,ILLE.,No more the sword of Ogier has she seen.

4541,ILLE.,"Such was the tale he told of Avallon,"
4542,ILLE.,E'en such an one as in days past had won
4543,ILLE.,His youthful heart to think upon the quest;
4544,ILLE.,"But to those old hearts nigh in reach of rest,"
4545,ILLE.,Not much to be desired now it seemed--
4546,ILLE.,Perchance the heart that of such things had dreamed
4547,ILLE.,Had found no words in this death-laden tongue
4548,ILLE.,"We speak on earth, wherewith they might be sung;"
4549,ILLE.,Perchance the changing years that changed his heart
4550,ILLE.,"E'en in the words of that old tale had part,"
4551,ILLE.,"Changing its sweet to bitter, to despair"
4552,ILLE.,The foolish hope that once had glittered there--
4553,ILLE.,"Or think, that in some bay of that far home"
4554,ILLE.,"They then had sat, and watched the green waves come"
4555,ILLE.,Up to their feet with many promises;
4556,ILLE.,"Or the light wind midst blossom-laden trees,"
4557,ILLE.,In the sweet Spring had weighted many a word
4558,ILLE.,"Of no worth now, and many a hope had stirred"
4559,ILLE.,Long dead for ever.
4560,ILLE.,Howsoe'er that be
4561,ILLE.,"Among strange folk they now sat quietly,"
4562,ILLE.,"As though that tale with them had nought to do,"
4563,ILLE.,As though its hopes and fears were something new.
4564,ILLE.,"But though, indeed, the outworn, dwindled band"
4565,ILLE.,"Had no tears left for that once longed-for land,"
4566,ILLE.,"The very wind must moan for their decay,"
4567,ILLE.,"And from the sky, grown dull, and low, and grey,"
4568,ILLE.,"Cold tears must fall upon the lonely field,"
4569,ILLE.,That such fair golden hopes erewhile did yield;
4570,ILLE.,"And on the blackening woods, wherein the doves"
4571,ILLE.,"Sat silent now, forgetful of their loves."
4572,ILLE.,"Yet, since a little life at least was left,"
4573,ILLE.,"They were not yet of every joy bereft,"
4574,ILLE.,"For long ago was past the agony,"
4575,ILLE.,Midst which they found that they indeed must die;
4576,ILLE.,And now well-nigh as much their pain was past
4577,ILLE.,As though death's veil already had been cast
4578,ILLE.,"Over their heads--so, midst some little mirth,"
4579,ILLE.,They watched the dark night hide the gloomy earth.

4652,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The younger said, ""when I set out from home--"
4653,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"As to my name, perchance in days to come"
4654,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4655,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""Thou shalt know that--but have heed, take this toy,"
4656,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And call me the Strong Man."" And as he spake"
4657,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The master's deep-brown eyes 'gan gleam with joy,"
4658,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"For from his arm a huge ring did he take,"
4659,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And cast it on the deck, where it did break"
4660,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"A water-jar, and in the wet shards lay"
4661,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Golden, and gleaming like the end of day."
4662,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4663,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"But the old man held out a withered hand,"
4664,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Wherein there shone two pearls most great and fair,"
4665,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And said, ""If any nigher I might stand,"
4666,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Then might'st thou see the things I give thee here--
4667,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And for a name--a many names I bear,"
4668,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"But call me Shepherd of the Shore this tide,"
4669,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And for more knowledge with a good will bide."""
4670,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4671,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,From one to the other turned the master's eyes;
4672,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The Strong Man laughed as at some hidden jest,"
4673,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And wild doubts in the shipman's heart did rise;
4674,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"But thinking on the thing, he deemed it best"
4675,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"To bid them come aboard, and take such rest"
4676,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"As they might have of the untrusty sea,"
4677,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,'Mid men who trusty fellows still should be.
4678,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4679,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Then no more words the Strong Man made, but straight"
4680,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Caught up the elder in his arms, and so,"
4681,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Making no whit of all that added weight,"
4682,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Strode to the ship, right through the breakers low,"
4683,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And catching at the rope that they did throw
4684,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Out toward his hand, swung up into the ship;"
4685,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Then did the master let the hawser slip.
4686,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4687,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The shapely prow cleft the wet mead and green,"
4688,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And wondering drew the shipmen round to gaze
4689,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Upon those limbs, the mightiest ever seen;"
4690,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And many deemed it no light thing to face
4691,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The splendour of his eyen, though they did blaze"
4692,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"With no wrath now, no hate for them to dread,"
4693,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,As seaward 'twixt the summer isles they sped.
4694,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4695,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Freshened the wind, but ever fair it blew"
4696,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Unto the south-east; but as failed the land,"
4697,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Unto the plunging prow the Strong Man drew,"
4698,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And silent, gazing with wide eyes did stand,"
4699,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,As though his heart found rest; but 'mid the band
4700,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Of shipmen in the stern the old man sat,"
4701,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Telling them tales that no man there forgat.
4702,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4703,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"As one who had beheld, he told them there"
4704,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Of the sweet singer, whom, for his song's sake,"
4705,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,The dolphins back from choking death did bear;
4706,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,How in the mid sea did the vine outbreak
4707,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,O'er that ill bark when Bacchus 'gan to wake;
4708,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"How anigh Cyprus, ruddy with the rose"
4709,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,The cold sea grew as any June-loved close;
4710,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4711,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,While on the flowery shore all things alive
4712,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Grew faint with sense of birth of some delight,"
4713,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And the nymphs waited trembling there, to give"
4714,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Glad welcome to the glory of that sight:
4715,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"He paused then, ere he told how, wild and white,"
4716,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Rose ocean, breaking o'er a race accurst,"
4717,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"A world once good, now come unto its worst."
4718,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4719,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And then he smiled, and said, ""And yet ye won,"
4720,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Ye men, and tremble not on days like these,"
4721,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Nor think with what a mind Prometheus' son
4722,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Beheld the last of the torn reeling trees
4723,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,From high Parnassus: slipping through the seas
4724,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Ye never think, ye men-folk, how ye seem"
4725,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"From down below through the green waters' gleam."""
4726,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4727,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Dusk was it now when these last words he said,"
4728,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And little of his visage might they see,"
4729,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"But o'er their hearts stole vague and troublous dread,"
4730,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,They knew not why; yet ever quietly
4731,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,They sailed that night; nor might a morning be
4732,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Fairer than was the next morn; and they went
4733,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Along their due course after their intent.
4734,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4735,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The fourth day, about sunrise, from the mast"
4736,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,The watch cried out he saw Phoenician land;
4737,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Whereat the Strong Man on the elder cast
4738,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"A look askance, and he straight took his stand"
4739,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Anigh the prow, and gazed beneath his hand"
4740,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Upon the low sun and the scarce-seen shore,"
4741,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Till cloud-flecks rose, and gathered and drew o'er."
4742,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4743,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The morn grown cold; then small rain 'gan to fall,"
4744,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And all the wind dropped dead, and hearts of men"
4745,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Sank, and their bark seemed helpless now and small;"
4746,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Then suddenly the wind 'gan moan again;
4747,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Sails flapped, and ropes beat wild about; and then"
4748,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Down came the great east wind; and the ship ran
4749,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Straining, heeled o'er, through seas all changed and wan."
4750,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4751,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Westward, scarce knowing night from day, they drave"
4752,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Through sea and sky grown one; the Strong Man wrought
4753,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"With mighty hands, and seemed a god to save;"
4754,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"But on the prow, heeding all weather nought,"
4755,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The elder stood, nor any prop he sought,"
4756,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"But swayed to the ship's wallowing, as on wings"
4757,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,He there were set above the wrack of things.
4758,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4759,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And westward still they drave; and if they saw
4760,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Land upon either side, as on they sped,"
4761,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,'Twas but as faces in a dream may draw
4762,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Anigh, and fade, and leave nought in their stead;"
4763,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And in the shipmen's hearts grew heavy dread
4764,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,To sick despair; they deemed they should drive on
4765,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Till the world's edge and empty space were won.
4766,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4767,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,But 'neath the Strong Man's eyes e'en as they might
4768,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"They toiled on still; and he sang to the wind,"
4769,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And spread his arms to meet the waters white,"
4770,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"As o'er the deck they tumbled, making blind"
4771,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,The brine-drenched shipmen; nor with eye unkind
4772,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,He gazed up at the lightning; nor would frown
4773,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,When o'er the wet waste Jove's bolt rattled down.
4774,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4775,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And they, who at the last had come to think"
4776,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Their guests were very gods, with all their fear"
4777,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Feared nought belike that their good ship would sink
4778,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Amid the storm; but rather looked to hear
4779,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,The last moan of the wind that them should bear
4780,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Into the windless stream of ocean grey,"
4781,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Where they should float till dead was every day.
4782,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4783,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Yet their fear mocked them; for the storm 'gan die
4784,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"About the tenth day, though unto the west"
4785,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,They drave on still; soon fair and quietly
4786,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,The morn would break: and though amid their rest
4787,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Nought but long evil wandering seemed the best
4788,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"That they might hope for; still, despite their dread,"
4789,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Sweet was the quiet sea and goodlihead
4790,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4791,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Of the bright sun at last come back again;
4792,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And as the days passed, less and less fear grew,"
4793,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"If without cause, till faded all their pain;"
4794,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And they 'gan turn unto their guests anew,"
4795,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Yet durst ask nought of what that evil drew
4796,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Upon their heads; or of returning speak.
4797,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Happy they felt, but listless, spent, and weak."
4798,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4799,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And now as at the first the elder was,"
4800,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And sat and told them tales of yore agone;
4801,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,But ever the Strong Man up and down would pass
4802,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"About the deck, or on the prow alone"
4803,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Would stand and stare out westward; and still on
4804,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Through a fair summer sea they went, nor thought"
4805,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Of what would come when these days turned to nought.
4806,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4807,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And now when twenty days were well passed o'er
4808,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,They made a new land; cloudy mountains high
4809,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Rose from the sea at first; then a green shore
4810,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Spread fair below them: as they drew anigh
4811,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"No sloping, stony strand could they espy,"
4812,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And no surf breaking; the green sea and wide
4813,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Wherethrough they slipped was driven by no tide.
4814,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4815,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Dark fell ere they might set their eager feet
4816,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Upon the shore; but night-long their ship lay
4817,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"As in a deep stream, by the blossoms sweet"
4818,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,That flecked the grass whence flowers ne'er passed away.
4819,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"But when the cloud-barred east brought back the day,"
4820,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And turned the western mountain-tops to gold,"
4821,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Fresh fear the shipmen in their bark did hold.
4822,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4823,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,For as a dream seemed all; too fair for those
4824,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Who needs must die; moreover they could see,"
4825,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"A furlong off, 'twixt apple-tree and rose,"
4826,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,A brazen wall that gleamed out wondrously
4827,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"In the young sun, and seemed right long to be;"
4828,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And memory of all marvels lay upon
4829,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Their shrinking hearts now this sweet place was won.
4830,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4831,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"But when unto the nameless guests they turned,"
4832,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Who stood together nigh the plank shot out
4833,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Shoreward, within the Strong Man's eyes there burned"
4834,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"A wild light, as the other one in doubt"
4835,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,He eyed a moment; then with a great shout
4836,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Leaped into the blossomed grass; the echoes rolled
4837,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Back from the hills, harsh still and over-bold."
4838,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4839,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Slowly the old man followed him, and still"
4840,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,The crew held back: they knew now they were brought
4841,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Over the sea the purpose to fulfil
4842,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Of these strange men; and in their hearts they thought,"
4843,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""Perchance we yet shall live, if, meddling nought"
4844,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"With dreams, we bide here till these twain come back;"
4845,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"But prying eyes the fire-blast seldom lack."""
4846,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4847,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Yet 'mongst them were two fellows bold and young,"
4848,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Who, looking each upon the other's face,"
4849,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Their hearts to meet the unknown danger strung,"
4850,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And went ashore, and at a gentle pace"
4851,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Followed the strangers, who unto the place"
4852,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Where the wall gleamed had turned; peace and desire
4853,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Mingled together in their hearts, as nigher"
4854,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4855,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"They drew unto that wall, and dulled their fear:"
4856,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Fair wrought it was, as though with bricks of brass;"
4857,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And images upon its face there were,"
4858,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Stories of things a long while come to pass:
4859,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Nor that alone--as looking in a glass
4860,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Its maker knew the tales of what should be,"
4861,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And wrought them there for bird and beast to see.
4862,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4863,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,So on they went; the many birds sang sweet
4864,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Through all that blossomed thicket from above,"
4865,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And unknown flowers bent down before their feet;
4866,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The very air, cleft by the grey-winged dove,"
4867,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Throbbed with sweet scent, and smote their souls with love."
4868,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Slowly they went till those twain stayed before
4869,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,A strangely-wrought and iron-covered door.
4870,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4871,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"They stayed, too, till o'er noise of wind, and bird,"
4872,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And falling flower, there rang a mighty shout"
4873,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"As the Strong Man his steel-bound club upreared,"
4874,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And drave it 'gainst the hammered iron stout,"
4875,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Where 'neath his blows flew bolt and rivet out,"
4876,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Till shattered on the ground the great door lay,"
4877,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And into the guarded place bright poured the day.
4878,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4879,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The Strong Man entered, but his fellow stayed,"
4880,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Leaning against a tree-trunk as they deemed.
4881,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"They faltered now, and yet all things being weighed"
4882,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Went on again; and thought they must have dreamed
4883,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Of the old man, for now the sunlight streamed"
4884,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Full on the tree he had been leaning on,"
4885,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And him they saw not go, yet was he gone:"
4886,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4887,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Only a slim green lizard flitted there
4888,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Amidst the dry leaves; him they noted nought,"
4889,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"But trembling, through the doorway 'gan to peer,"
4890,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And still of strange and dreadful saw not aught,"
4891,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Only a garden fair beyond all thought.
4892,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And there, 'twixt sun and shade, the Strong Man went"
4893,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,On some long-sought-for end belike intent.
4894,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4895,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,They 'gan to follow down a narrow way
4896,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Of green-sward that the lilies trembled o'er,"
4897,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And whereon thick the scattered rose-leaves lay;
4898,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"But a great wonder weighed upon them sore,"
4899,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And well they thought they should return no more,"
4900,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Yet scarce a pain that seemed; they looked to meet
4901,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Before they died things strange and fair and sweet.
4902,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4903,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,So still to right and left the Strong Man thrust
4904,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The blossomed boughs, and passed on steadily,"
4905,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"As though his hardy heart he well did trust,"
4906,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Till in a while he gave a joyous cry,"
4907,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And hastened on, as though the end drew nigh;"
4908,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And women's voices then they deemed they heard,"
4909,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Mixed with a noise that made desire afeard.
4910,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4911,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Yet through sweet scents and sounds on did they bear
4912,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Their panting hearts, till the path ended now"
4913,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"In a wide space of green, a streamlet clear"
4914,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"From out a marble basin there did flow,"
4915,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And close by that a slim-trunked tree did grow,"
4916,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And on a bough low o'er the water cold
4917,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,There hung three apples of red-gleaming gold.
4918,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4919,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"About the tree, new risen e'en now to meet"
4920,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The shining presence of that mighty one,"
4921,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Three damsels stood, naked from head to feet"
4922,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Save for the glory of their hair, where sun"
4923,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And shadow flickered, while the wind did run"
4924,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Through the grey leaves o'erhead, and shook the grass"
4925,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Where nigh their feet the wandering bee did pass.
4926,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4927,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,But 'midst their delicate limbs and all around
4928,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The tree-roots, gleaming blue black could they see"
4929,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The spires of a great serpent, that, enwound"
4930,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"About the smooth bole, looked forth threateningly,"
4931,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"With glittering eyes and raised crest, o'er the three"
4932,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Fair heads fresh crowned, and hissed above the speech"
4933,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Wherewith they murmured softly each to each.
4934,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4935,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Now the Strong Man amid the green space stayed,"
4936,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And leaning on his club, with eager eyes"
4937,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"But brow yet smooth, in voice yet friendly said:"
4938,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""O daughters of old Hesperus the Wise,"
4939,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Well have ye held your guard here; but time tries
4940,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The very will of gods, and to my hand"
4941,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Must give this day the gold fruit of your land."""
4942,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4943,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Then spake the first maid--sweet as the west wind
4944,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Amidst of summer noon her sweet voice was:
4945,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""Ah, me! what knows this place of changing mind"
4946,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Of men or gods; here shall long ages pass,"
4947,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And clean forget thy feet upon the grass,"
4948,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Thy hapless bones amid the fruitful mould;
4949,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Look at thy death envenomed swift and cold!"""
4950,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4951,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Hiding new flowers, the dull coils, as she spake,"
4952,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Moved near her limbs: but then the second one,"
4953,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,In such a voice as when the morn doth wake
4954,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"To song of birds, said, ""When the world foredone"
4955,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Has moaned its last, still shall we dwell alone"
4956,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Beneath this bough, and have no tales to tell"
4957,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Of things deemed great that on the earth befell."""
4958,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4959,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Then spake the third, in voice as of the flute"
4960,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,That wakes the maiden to her wedding morn:
4961,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""If any god should gain our golden fruit,"
4962,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Its curse would make his deathless life forlorn.
4963,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Lament thou, then, that ever thou wert born;"
4964,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Yet all things, changed by joy or loss or pain,"
4965,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"To what they were shall change and change again."""
4966,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4967,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""So be it,"" he said, ""the Fates that drive me on"
4968,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Shall slay me or shall save; blessing or curse
4969,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,That followeth after when the thing is won
4970,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Shall make my work no better now nor worse;
4971,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And if it be that the world's heart must nurse
4972,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Hatred against me, how then shall I choose"
4973,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"To leave or take?--let your dread servant loose!"""
4974,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4975,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"E'en therewith, like a pillar of black smoke,"
4976,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Swift, shifting ever, drave the worm at him;"
4977,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"In deadly silence now that nothing broke,"
4978,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Its folds were writhing round him trunk and limb,"
4979,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Until his glittering gear was nought but dim
4980,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"E'en in that sunshine, while his head and side"
4981,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And breast the fork-tongued, pointed muzzle tried."
4982,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4983,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Closer the coils drew, quicker all about"
4984,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The forked tongue darted, and yet stiff he stood,"
4985,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,E'en as an oak that sees the straw flare out
4986,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And lick its ancient bole for little good:
4987,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Until the godlike fury of his mood
4988,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Burst from his heart in one great shattering cry,"
4989,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And rattling down the loosened coils did lie;
4990,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4991,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And from the torn throat and crushed dreadful head
4992,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Forth flowed a stream of blood along the grass;
4993,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Bright in the sun he stood above the dead,"
4994,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Panting with fury; yet as ever was
4995,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The wont of him, soon did his anger pass,"
4996,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And with a happy smile at last he turned
4997,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,To where the apples o'er the water burned.
4998,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
4999,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Silent and moveless ever stood the three;
5000,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"No change came o'er their faces, as his hand"
5001,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Was stretched aloft unto the sacred tree;
5002,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Nor shrank they aught aback, though he did stand"
5003,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"So close that tresses of their bright hair, fanned"
5004,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"By the sweet garden breeze, lay light on him,"
5005,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And his gold fell brushed by them breast and limb.
5006,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5007,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"He drew adown the wind-stirred bough, and took"
5008,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The apples thence; then let it spring away,"
5009,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And from his brow the dark hair backward shook,"
5010,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And said: ""O sweet, O fair, and shall this day"
5011,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,A curse upon my life henceforward lay--
5012,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,This day alone? Methinks of coming life
5013,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Somewhat I know, with all its loss and strife."
5014,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5015,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""But this I know, at least: the world shall wend"
5016,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Upon its way, and, gathering joy and grief"
5017,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And deeds done, bear them with it to the end;"
5018,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"So shall it, though I lie as last year's leaf"
5019,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Lies 'neath a summer tree, at least receive"
5020,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"My life gone by, and store it, with the gain"
5021,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"That men alive call striving, wrong, and pain."
5022,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5023,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""So for my part I rather bless than curse,"
5024,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And bless this fateful land; good be with it;
5025,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Nor for this deadly thing's death is it worse,"
5026,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Nor for the lack of gold; still shall ye sit
5027,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Watching the swallow o'er the daisies flit;
5028,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Still shall your wandering limbs ere day is done
5029,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Make dawn desired by the sinking sun.
5030,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5031,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""And now, behold! in memory of all this"
5032,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Take ye this girdle that shall waste and fade
5033,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"As fadeth not your fairness and your bliss,"
5034,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,That when hereafter 'mid the blossoms laid
5035,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Ye talk of days and men now nothing made,"
5036,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Ye may remember how the Theban man,"
5037,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The son of Jove, came o'er the waters wan."""
5038,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5039,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Their faces changed not aught for all they heard;
5040,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"As though all things now fully told out were,"
5041,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,They gazed upon him without any word:
5042,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Ah! craving kindness, hope, or loving care,"
5043,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Their fairness scarcely could have made more fair,"
5044,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,As with the apples folded in his fell
5045,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"He went, to do more deeds for folk to tell."
5046,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5047,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Now as the girdle on the ground was cast
5048,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Those fellows turned and hurried toward the door,"
5049,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And as across its broken leaves they passed
5050,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The old man saw they not, e'en as before;"
5051,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,But an unearthed blind mole bewildered sore
5052,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Was wandering there in fruitless, aimless wise,"
5053,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,That got small heed from their full-sated eyes.
5054,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5055,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Swift gat they to their anxious folk; nor had
5056,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"More time than just to say, ""Be of good cheer,"
5057,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"For in our own land may we yet be glad,"""
5058,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,When they beheld the guests a-drawing near;
5059,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And much bewildered the two fellows were
5060,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"To see the old man, and must even deem"
5061,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,That they should see things stranger than a dream.
5062,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5063,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"But when they were aboard the elder cried,"
5064,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""Up sails, my masters, fair now is the wind;"
5065,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Nor good it is too long here to abide,"
5066,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Lest what ye may not loose your souls should bind."""
5067,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And as he spake, the tall trees left behind"
5068,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Stirred with the rising land-wind, and the crew,"
5069,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Joyous thereat, the hawsers shipward drew."
5070,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5071,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Swift sped the ship, and glad at heart were all,"
5072,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And the Strong Man was merry with the rest,"
5073,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And from the elder's lips no word did fall
5074,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,That did not seem to promise all the best;
5075,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Yet with a certain awe were men oppressed,"
5076,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And felt as if their inmost hearts were bare,"
5077,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And each man's secret babbled through the air.
5078,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5079,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Still oft the old man sat with them and told
5080,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Tales of past time, as on the outward way;"
5081,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And now would they the face of him behold
5082,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And deem it changed; the years that on him lay
5083,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Seemed to grow nought, and no more wan and grey"
5084,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"He looked, but ever glorious, wise and strong,"
5085,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,As though no lapse of time for him were long.
5086,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5087,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"At last, when six days through the kindly sea"
5088,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Their keel had slipped, he said: ""Come hearken now,"
5089,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,For so it is that things fare wondrously
5090,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,E'en in these days; and I a tale can show
5091,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"That, told by you unto your sons shall grow"
5092,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,A marvel of the days that are to come:
5093,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Take heed and tell it when ye reach your home.
5094,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5095,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""Yet living in the world a man there is"
5096,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Men call the Theban King Amphitryon's son,"
5097,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Although perchance a greater sire was his;
5098,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,But certainly his lips have hung upon
5099,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Alcmena's breasts: great deeds this man hath won
5100,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Already, for his name is Hercules,"
5101,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And e'en ye Asian folk have heard of these.
5102,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5103,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""Now ere the moon, this eve in his last wane,"
5104,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Was born, this Hercules, the fated thrall"
5105,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Of King Eurystheus, was straight bid to gain"
5106,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Gifts from a land whereon no foot doth fall
5107,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Of mortal man, beyond the misty wall"
5108,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Of unknown waters; pensively he went
5109,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Along the sea on his hard life intent.
5110,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5111,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""And at the dawn he came into a bay"
5112,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Where the sea, ebbed far down, left wastes of sand,"
5113,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Walled from the green earth by great cliffs and grey;
5114,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Then he looked up, and wondering there did stand,"
5115,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,For strange things lay in slumber on the strand;
5116,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Strange counterparts of what the firm earth hath
5117,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Lay scattered all about his weary path:
5118,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5119,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""Sea-lions and sea-horses and sea-kine,"
5120,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Sea-boars, sea-men strange-skinned, of wondrous hair;"
5121,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And in their midst a man who seemed divine
5122,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"For changeless eld, and round him women fair,"
5123,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Clad in the sea-webs glassy green and clear
5124,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"With gems on head and girdle, limb and breast,"
5125,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Such as earth knoweth not among her best.
5126,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5127,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""A moment at the fair and wondrous sight"
5128,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"He stared, then, since the heart in him was good,"
5129,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,He went about with careful steps and light
5130,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Till o'er the sleeping sea-god now he stood;
5131,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And if the white-foot maids had stirred his blood
5132,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"As he passed by, now other thoughts had place"
5133,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Within his heart when he beheld that face.
5134,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5135,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""For Nereus now he knew, who knows all things;"
5136,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And to himself he said, 'If I prevail,"
5137,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Better than by some god-wrought eagle-wings
5138,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Shall I be holpen;' then he cried out: 'Hail,"
5139,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,O Nereus! lord of shifting hill and dale!
5140,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Arise and wrestle; I am Hercules!
5141,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Not soon now shalt thou meet the ridgy seas.'
5142,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5143,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""And mightily he cast himself on him;"
5144,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And Nereus cried out shrilly; and straightway
5145,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"That sleeping crowd, fair maid with half-hid limb,"
5146,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Strange man and green-haired beast, made no delay,"
5147,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"But glided down into the billows grey,"
5148,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And, by the lovely sea embraced, were gone,"
5149,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,While they two wrestled on the sea strand lone.
5150,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5151,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""Soon found the sea-god that his bodily might"
5152,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Was nought in dealing with Jove's dear one there;
5153,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And soon he 'gan to use his magic sleight:
5154,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Into a lithe leopard, and a hugging bear"
5155,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,He turned him; then the smallest fowl of air
5156,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The straining arms of Hercules must hold,"
5157,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And then a mud-born wriggling eel and cold.
5158,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5159,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""Then as the firm hands mastered this, forth brake"
5160,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"A sudden rush of waters all around,"
5161,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Blinding and choking: then a thin green snake
5162,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,With golden eyes; then o'er the shell-strewn ground
5163,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Forth stole a fly the least that may be found;
5164,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Then earth and heaven seemed wrapped in one huge flame,"
5165,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,But from the midst thereof a voice there came:
5166,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5167,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""'Kinsman and stout-heart, thou hast won the day,"
5168,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Nor to my grief: what wouldst thou have of me?'
5169,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And therewith to an old man small and grey
5170,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Faded the roaring flame, who wearily"
5171,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Sat down upon the sand and said, 'Let be!"
5172,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,I know thy tale; worthy of help thou art;
5173,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Come now, a short way hence will there depart"
5174,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5175,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""'A ship of Tyre for the warm southern seas,"
5176,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Come we a-board; according to my will
5177,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Her way shall be.' Then up rose Hercules,"
5178,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Merry of face, though hot and panting still;"
5179,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,But the fair summer day his heart did fill
5180,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"With all delight; and so forth went the twain,"
5181,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And found those men desirous of all gain.
5182,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5183,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""Ah, for these gainful men--somewhat indeed"
5184,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Their sails are rent, their bark beat; kin and friend"
5185,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Are wearying for them; yet a friend in need
5186,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"They yet shall gain, if at their journey's end,"
5187,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Upon the last ness where the wild goats wend
5188,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"To lick the salt-washed stones, a house they raise"
5189,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Bedight with gold in kindly Nereus' praise."""
5190,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5191,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Breathless they waited for these latest words,"
5192,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,That like the soft wind of the gathering night
5193,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Were grown to be: about the mast flew birds
5194,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Making their moan, hovering long-winged and white;"
5195,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And now before their straining anxious sight
5196,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The old man faded out into the air,"
5197,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,And from his place flew forth a sea-mew fair.
5198,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5199,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Then to the Mighty Man, Alcmena's son,"
5200,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"With yearning hearts they turned till he should speak,"
5201,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And he spake softly: ""Nought ill have ye done"
5202,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,In helping me to find what I did seek:
5203,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,The world made better by me knows if weak
5204,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"My hand and heart are: but now, light the fire"
5205,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Upon the prow and worship the grey sire."""
5206,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5207,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,So did they; and such gifts as there they had
5208,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Gave unto Nereus; yea, and sooth to say,"
5209,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Amid the tumult of their hearts made glad,"
5210,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Had honoured Hercules in e'en such way;
5211,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"But he laughed out amid them, and said, ""Nay,"
5212,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Not yet the end is come; nor have I yet
5213,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Bowed down before vain longing and regret.
5214,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5215,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"""It may be--who shall tell, when I go back"
5216,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"There whence I came, and looking down behold"
5217,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"The place that my once eager heart shall lack,"
5218,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"And all my dead desires a-lying cold,"
5219,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,But I may have the might then to enfold
5220,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,The hopes of brave men in my heart?--but long
5221,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Life lies before first with its change and wrong."""
5222,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5223,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,So fair along the watery ways they sped
5224,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"In happy wise, nor failed of their return;"
5225,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Nor failed in ancient Tyre the ways to tread,"
5226,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"Teaching their tale to whomsoever would learn,"
5227,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,Nor failed at last the flesh of beasts to burn
5228,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"In Nereus' house, turned toward the bright day's end"
5229,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,"On the last ness, round which the wild goats wend."
5230,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5231,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,
5232,THE GOLDEN APPLES.,

5234,L'ENVOI.,L'ENVOI.
5235,L'ENVOI.,
5236,L'ENVOI.,
5237,L'ENVOI.,"Here are we for the last time face to face,"
5238,L'ENVOI.,"Thou and I, Book, before I bid thee speed"
5239,L'ENVOI.,Upon thy perilous journey to that place
5240,L'ENVOI.,"For which I have done on thee pilgrim's weed,"
5241,L'ENVOI.,Striving to get thee all things for thy need--
5242,L'ENVOI.,"--I love thee, whatso time or men may say"
5243,L'ENVOI.,Of the poor singer of an empty day.
5244,L'ENVOI.,
5245,L'ENVOI.,"Good reason why I love thee, e'en if thou"
5246,L'ENVOI.,Be mocked or clean forgot as time wears on;
5247,L'ENVOI.,"For ever as thy fashioning did grow,"
5248,L'ENVOI.,Kind word and praise because of thee I won
5249,L'ENVOI.,"From those without whom were my world all gone,"
5250,L'ENVOI.,"My hope fallen dead, my singing cast away,"
5251,L'ENVOI.,And I set soothly in an empty day.
5252,L'ENVOI.,
5253,L'ENVOI.,"I love thee; yet this last time must it be,"
5254,L'ENVOI.,"That thou must hold thy peace and I must speak,"
5255,L'ENVOI.,Lest if thou babble I begin to see
5256,L'ENVOI.,"Thy gear too thin, thy limbs and heart too weak,"
5257,L'ENVOI.,To find the land thou goest forth to seek--
5258,L'ENVOI.,"--Though what harm if thou die upon the way,"
5259,L'ENVOI.,Thou idle singer of an empty day?
5260,L'ENVOI.,
5261,L'ENVOI.,"But though this land desired thou never reach,"
5262,L'ENVOI.,Yet folk who know it mayst thou meet or death;
5263,L'ENVOI.,Therefore a word unto thee would I teach
5264,L'ENVOI.,"To answer these, who, noting thy weak breath,"
5265,L'ENVOI.,"Thy wandering eyes, thy heart of little faith,"
5266,L'ENVOI.,"May make thy fond desire a sport and play,"
5267,L'ENVOI.,Mocking the singer of an empty day.
5268,L'ENVOI.,
5269,L'ENVOI.,"That land's name, say'st thou? and the road thereto?"
5270,L'ENVOI.,"Nay, Book, thou mockest, saying thou know'st it not;"
5271,L'ENVOI.,Surely no book of verse I ever knew
5272,L'ENVOI.,But ever was the heart within him hot
5273,L'ENVOI.,To gain the Land of Matters Unforgot--
5274,L'ENVOI.,"--There, now we both laugh--as the whole world may,"
5275,L'ENVOI.,At us poor singers of an empty day.
5276,L'ENVOI.,
5277,L'ENVOI.,"Nay, let it pass, and hearken! Hast thou heard"
5278,L'ENVOI.,"That therein I believe I have a friend,"
5279,L'ENVOI.,Of whom for love I may not be afeard?
5280,L'ENVOI.,It is to him indeed I bid thee wend;
5281,L'ENVOI.,"Yea, he perchance may meet thee ere thou end,"
5282,L'ENVOI.,"Dying so far off from the hedge of bay,"
5283,L'ENVOI.,Thou idle singer of an empty day!
5284,L'ENVOI.,
5285,L'ENVOI.,"Well, think of him, I bid thee, on the road,"
5286,L'ENVOI.,"And if it hap that midst of thy defeat,"
5287,L'ENVOI.,"Fainting beneath thy follies' heavy load,"
5288,L'ENVOI.,"My Master, Geoffrey Chaucer, thou do meet,"
5289,L'ENVOI.,Then shalt thou win a space of rest full sweet;
5290,L'ENVOI.,"Then be thou bold, and speak the words I say,"
5291,L'ENVOI.,The idle singer of an empty day!
5292,L'ENVOI.,
5293,L'ENVOI.,"""O Master, O thou great of heart and tongue,"
5294,L'ENVOI.,"Thou well mayst ask me why I wander here,"
5295,L'ENVOI.,In raiment rent of stories oft besung!
5296,L'ENVOI.,"But of thy gentleness draw thou anear,"
5297,L'ENVOI.,And then the heart of one who held thee dear
5298,L'ENVOI.,Mayst thou behold! So near as that I lay
5299,L'ENVOI.,Unto the singer of an empty day.
5300,L'ENVOI.,
5301,L'ENVOI.,"""For this he ever said, who sent me forth"
5302,L'ENVOI.,To seek a place amid thy company;
5303,L'ENVOI.,"That howsoever little was my worth,"
5304,L'ENVOI.,Yet was he worth e'en just so much as I;
5305,L'ENVOI.,He said that rhyme hath little skill to lie:
5306,L'ENVOI.,Nor feigned to cast his worser part away
5307,L'ENVOI.,In idle singing for an empty day.
5308,L'ENVOI.,
5309,L'ENVOI.,"""I have beheld him tremble oft enough"
5310,L'ENVOI.,"At things he could not choose but trust to me,"
5311,L'ENVOI.,Although he knew the world was wise and rough:
5312,L'ENVOI.,And never did he fail to let me see
5313,L'ENVOI.,"His love,--his folly and faithlessness, may be;"
5314,L'ENVOI.,And still in turn I gave him voice to pray
5315,L'ENVOI.,Such prayers as cling about an empty day.
5316,L'ENVOI.,
5317,L'ENVOI.,"""Thou, keen-eyed, reading me, mayst read him through,"
5318,L'ENVOI.,For surely little is there left behind;
5319,L'ENVOI.,No power great deeds unnameable to do;
5320,L'ENVOI.,"No knowledge for which words he may not find,"
5321,L'ENVOI.,No love of things as vague as autumn wind--
5322,L'ENVOI.,"--Earth of the earth lies hidden by my clay,"
5323,L'ENVOI.,The idle singer of an empty day!
5324,L'ENVOI.,
5325,L'ENVOI.,"""Children we twain are, saith he, late made wise"
5326,L'ENVOI.,"In love, but in all else most childish still,"
5327,L'ENVOI.,"And seeking still the pleasure of our eyes,"
5328,L'ENVOI.,And what our ears with sweetest sounds may fill;
5329,L'ENVOI.,"Not fearing Love, lest these things he should kill;"
5330,L'ENVOI.,"Howe'er his pain by pleasure doth he lay,"
5331,L'ENVOI.,Making a strange tale of an empty day.
5332,L'ENVOI.,
5333,L'ENVOI.,"""Death have we hated, knowing not what it meant;"
5334,L'ENVOI.,"Life have we loved, through green leaf and through sere,"
5335,L'ENVOI.,Though still the less we knew of its intent:
5336,L'ENVOI.,"The Earth and Heaven through countless year on year,"
5337,L'ENVOI.,"Slow changing, were to us but curtains fair,"
5338,L'ENVOI.,"Hung round about a little room, where play"
5339,L'ENVOI.,Weeping and laughter of man's empty day.
5340,L'ENVOI.,
5341,L'ENVOI.,"""O Master, if thine heart could love us yet,"
5342,L'ENVOI.,"Spite of things left undone, and wrongly done,"
5343,L'ENVOI.,"Some place in loving hearts then should we get,"
5344,L'ENVOI.,"For thou, sweet-souled, didst never stand alone,"
5345,L'ENVOI.,But knew'st the joy and woe of many an one--
5346,L'ENVOI.,"--By lovers dead, who live through thee we pray,"
5347,L'ENVOI.,"Help thou us singers of an empty day!"""
5348,L'ENVOI.,
5349,L'ENVOI.,"Fearest thou, Book, what answer thou mayst gain"

5351,L'ENVOI.,"Nay, it shall not be.--Thou mayst toil in vain,"
5352,L'ENVOI.,And never draw the House of Fame anigh;
5353,L'ENVOI.,"Yet he and his shall know whereof we cry,"
5354,L'ENVOI.,Shall call it not ill done to strive to lay
5355,L'ENVOI.,The ghosts that crowd about life's empty day.
5356,L'ENVOI.,
5357,L'ENVOI.,Then let the others go! and if indeed
5358,L'ENVOI.,"In some old garden thou and I have wrought,"
5359,L'ENVOI.,"And made fresh flowers spring up from hoarded seed,"
5360,L'ENVOI.,And fragrance of old days and deeds have brought
5361,L'ENVOI.,Back to folk weary; all was not for nought.

5377,INTERLUDES.,Though the sky be too dark for dim eyes to discover
5378,INTERLUDES.,"The gold-cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder,"
5379,INTERLUDES.,"Though the hills be held shadows, and the sea a dark wonder,"
5380,INTERLUDES.,"And this day draw a veil over all deeds, passed over,"

5382,INTERLUDES.,"The void shall not weary, the fear shall not alter"
5383,INTERLUDES.,These lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover.

5387,INTERLUDES.,
5388,INTERLUDES.,Love is enough: it grew up without heeding
5389,INTERLUDES.,"In the days when ye knew not its name nor its measure,"
5390,INTERLUDES.,And its leaflets untrodden by the light feet of pleasure
5391,INTERLUDES.,"Had no boast of the blossom, no sign of the seeding,"
5392,INTERLUDES.,As the morning and evening passed over its treasure.
5393,INTERLUDES.,
5394,INTERLUDES.,And what do ye say then?--that Spring long departed
5395,INTERLUDES.,Has brought forth no child to the softness and showers;
5396,INTERLUDES.,--That we slept and we dreamed through the Summer of flowers;
5397,INTERLUDES.,"We dreamed of the Winter, and waking dead-hearted"
5398,INTERLUDES.,Found Winter upon us and waste of dull hours.
5399,INTERLUDES.,
5400,INTERLUDES.,"Nay, Spring was o'er happy and knew not the reason,"
5401,INTERLUDES.,"And Summer dreamed sadly, for she thought all was ended"
5402,INTERLUDES.,In her fulness of wealth that might not be amended;
5403,INTERLUDES.,"But this is the harvest and the garnering season,"
5404,INTERLUDES.,And the leaf and the blossom in the ripe fruit are blended.
5405,INTERLUDES.,
5406,INTERLUDES.,"It sprang without sowing, it grew without heeding,"
5407,INTERLUDES.,"Ye knew not its name and ye knew not its measure,"
5408,INTERLUDES.,Ye noted it not mid your hope and your pleasure;
5409,INTERLUDES.,"There was pain in its blossom, despair in its seeding,"
5410,INTERLUDES.,But daylong your bosom now nurseth its treasure.
5411,INTERLUDES.,
5412,INTERLUDES.,
5413,INTERLUDES.,3.
5414,INTERLUDES.,
5415,INTERLUDES.,Love is enough: draw near and behold me
5416,INTERLUDES.,"Ye who pass by the way to your rest and your laughter,"
5417,INTERLUDES.,And are full of the hope of the dawn coming after
5418,INTERLUDES.,For the strong of the world have bought me and sold me
5419,INTERLUDES.,And my house is all wasted from threshold to rafter.
5420,INTERLUDES.,"--Pass by me, and hearken, and think of me not!"
5421,INTERLUDES.,
5422,INTERLUDES.,"Cry out and come near; for my ears may not hearken,"
5423,INTERLUDES.,And my eyes are grown dim as the eyes of the dying.
5424,INTERLUDES.,Is this the grey rack o'er the sun's face a-flying?
5425,INTERLUDES.,Or is it your faces his brightness that darken?
5426,INTERLUDES.,"Comes a wind from the sea, or is it your sighing?"
5427,INTERLUDES.,"--Pass by me and hearken, and pity me not!"
5428,INTERLUDES.,
5429,INTERLUDES.,Ye know not how void is your hope and your living:
5430,INTERLUDES.,Depart with your helping lest yet ye undo me!
5431,INTERLUDES.,"Ye know not that at nightfall she draweth near to me,"
5432,INTERLUDES.,There is soft speech between us and words of forgiving
5433,INTERLUDES.,Till in dead of the midnight her kisses thrill through me.
5434,INTERLUDES.,"--Pass by me and hearken, and waken me not!"
5435,INTERLUDES.,
5436,INTERLUDES.,"Wherewith will ye buy it, ye rich who behold me?"
5437,INTERLUDES.,"Draw out from your coffers your rest and your laughter,"
5438,INTERLUDES.,And the fair gilded hope of the dawn coming after!
5439,INTERLUDES.,"Nay this I sell not,--though ye bought me and sold me,--"
5440,INTERLUDES.,For your house stored with such things from threshold to rafter.
5441,INTERLUDES.,"--Pass by me, I hearken, and think of you not!"

5452,INTERLUDES.,
5453,INTERLUDES.,"He leadeth, He hearkeneth, He cometh to you-ward;"

5455,INTERLUDES.,"Round his goad for the faint, and his scourge for the froward:"

5457,INTERLUDES.,Lo! his eyes of all sorrow that may not dissemble!
5458,INTERLUDES.,"Cry out, for he heedeth, ""O Love, lead us home!"""

5492,R E G I N.,
5493,R E G I N.,"Now this is the first book of the life and death of Sigurd the Volsung,"
5494,R E G I N.,"and therein is told of the birth of him, and of his dealings with Regin"
5495,R E G I N.,"the master of masters, and of his deeds in the waste places of the"
5496,R E G I N.,earth.
5497,R E G I N.,
5498,R E G I N.,_Of the birth of Sigurd the son of Sigmund._
5499,R E G I N.,
5500,R E G I N.,Peace lay on the land of the Helper and the house of Elf his son;
5501,R E G I N.,"There merry men went bedward when their tide of toil was done,"
5502,R E G I N.,"And glad was the dawn's awakening, and the noontide fair and glad:"
5503,R E G I N.,"There no great store had the franklin, and enough the hireling had;"
5504,R E G I N.,And a child might go unguarded the length and breadth of the land
5505,R E G I N.,With a purse of gold at his girdle and gold rings on his hand.
5506,R E G I N.,"'Twas a country of cunning craftsmen, and many a thing they wrought,"
5507,R E G I N.,"That the lands of storm desired, and the homes of warfare sought."
5508,R E G I N.,"But men deemed it o'er-well warded by more than its stems of fight,"
5509,R E G I N.,And told how its earth-born watchers yet lived of plenteous might.
5510,R E G I N.,"So hidden was that country, and few men sailed its sea,"
5511,R E G I N.,And none came o'er its mountains of men-folk's company.
5512,R E G I N.,"But fair-fruited, many-peopled, it lies a goodly strip,"
5513,R E G I N.,"'Twixt the mountains cloudy-headed and the sea-flood's surging lip,"
5514,R E G I N.,"And a perilous flood is its ocean, and its mountains, who shall tell"
5515,R E G I N.,What things in their dales deserted and their wind-swept heaths may dwell.
5516,R E G I N.,"Now a man of the Kings, called Gripir, in this land of peace abode:"
5517,R E G I N.,"The son of the Helper's father, though never lay his load"
5518,R E G I N.,In the womb of the mother of Kings that the Helper's brethren bore;
5519,R E G I N.,"But of Giant kin was his mother, of the folk that are seen no more;"
5520,R E G I N.,Though whiles as ye ride some fell-road across the heath there comes
5521,R E G I N.,The voice of their lone lamenting o'er their changed and conquered homes.
5522,R E G I N.,A long way off from the sea-strand and beneath the mountains' feet
5523,R E G I N.,"Is the high-built hall of Gripir, where the waste and the tillage meet;"
5524,R E G I N.,"A noble and plentiful house, that a little men-folk fear,"
5525,R E G I N.,But beloved of the crag-dwelling eagles and the kin of the woodland deer.
5526,R E G I N.,"A man of few words was Gripir, but he knew of all deeds that had been,"
5527,R E G I N.,"And times there came upon him, when the deeds to be were seen:"
5528,R E G I N.,"No sword had he held in his hand since his father fell to field,"
5529,R E G I N.,And against the life of the slayer he bore undinted shield:
5530,R E G I N.,"Yet no fear in his heart abided, nor desired he aught at all,"
5531,R E G I N.,"But he noted the deeds that had been, and looked for what should befall."
5532,R E G I N.,
5533,R E G I N.,"Again, in the house of the Helper there dwelt a certain man"
5534,R E G I N.,"Beardless and low of stature, of visage pinched and wan:"
5535,R E G I N.,"So exceeding old was Regin, that no son of man could tell"
5536,R E G I N.,In what year of the days passed over he came to that land to dwell;
5537,R E G I N.,"But the youth of King Elf had he fostered, and the Helper's youth thereto,"
5538,R E G I N.,"Yes and his father's father's: the lore of all men he knew,"
5539,R E G I N.,"And was deft in every cunning, save the dealings of the sword:"
5540,R E G I N.,"So sweet was his tongue-speech fashioned, that men trowed his every word;"
5541,R E G I N.,His hand with the harp-strings blended was the mingler of delight
5542,R E G I N.,With the latter days of sorrow; all tales he told aright;
5543,R E G I N.,The Master of the Masters in the smithying craft was he;
5544,R E G I N.,And he dealt with the wind and the weather and the stilling of the sea;
5545,R E G I N.,"Nor might any learn him leech-craft, for before that race was made,"
5546,R E G I N.,"And that man-folk's generation, all their life-days had he weighed."
5547,R E G I N.,
5548,R E G I N.,In this land abideth Hiordis amid all people's praise
5549,R E G I N.,Till cometh the time appointed: in the fulness of the days
5550,R E G I N.,"Through the dark and the dusk she travailed, till at last in the dawning"
5551,R E G I N.,hour
5552,R E G I N.,"Have the deeds of the Volsungs blossomed, and born their latest flower;"
5553,R E G I N.,"In the bed there lieth a man child, and his eyes look straight on the sun,"
5554,R E G I N.,"And lo, the hope of the people, and the days of a king are begun."
5555,R E G I N.,
5556,R E G I N.,"Men say of the serving-women, when they cried on the joy of the morn,"
5557,R E G I N.,"When they handled the linen raiment, and washed the king new-born,"
5558,R E G I N.,"When they bore him back unto Hiordis, and the weary and happy breast,"
5559,R E G I N.,"And bade her be glad to behold it, how the best was sprung from the best,"
5560,R E G I N.,"Yet they shrank in their rejoicing before the eyes of the child,"
5561,R E G I N.,"So bright and dreadful were they; yea though the spring morn smiled,"
5562,R E G I N.,"And a thousand birds were singing round the fair familiar home,"
5563,R E G I N.,"And still as on other mornings they saw folk go and come,"
5564,R E G I N.,"Yet the hour seemed awful to them, and the hearts within them burned"
5565,R E G I N.,As though of fateful matters their souls were newly learned.
5566,R E G I N.,
5567,R E G I N.,"But Hiordis looked on the Volsung, on her grief and her fond desire,"
5568,R E G I N.,"And the hope of her heart was quickened, and her joy was a living fire;"
5569,R E G I N.,"And she said: ""Now one of the earthly on the eyes of my child hath gazed"
5570,R E G I N.,"Nor shrunk before their glory, nor stayed her love amazed:"
5571,R E G I N.,"I behold thee as Sigmund beholdeth,--and I was the home of thine heart--"
5572,R E G I N.,"Woe's me for the day when thou wert not, and the hour when we shall part!"""
5573,R E G I N.,
5574,R E G I N.,Then she held him a little season on her weary and happy breast
5575,R E G I N.,And she told him of Sigmund and Volsung and the best sprung forth from
5576,R E G I N.,the best:
5577,R E G I N.,"She spake to the new-born baby as one who might understand,"
5578,R E G I N.,"And told him of Sigmund's battle, and the dead by the sea-flood's strand,"
5579,R E G I N.,"And of all the wars passed over, and the light with darkness blent."
5580,R E G I N.,
5581,R E G I N.,"So she spake, and the sun rose higher, and her speech at last was spent,"
5582,R E G I N.,"And she gave him back to the women to bear forth to the people's kings,"
5583,R E G I N.,That they too may rejoice in her glory and her day of happy things.
5584,R E G I N.,
5585,R E G I N.,"But there sat the Helper of Men with King Elf and Earls in the hall,"
5586,R E G I N.,"And they spake of the deeds that had been, and told of the times to"
5587,R E G I N.,"befall,"
5588,R E G I N.,And they hearkened and heard sweet voices and the sound of harps draw
5589,R E G I N.,"nigh,"
5590,R E G I N.,Till their hearts were exceeding merry and they knew not wherefore or
5591,R E G I N.,why:
5592,R E G I N.,"Then, lo, in the hall white raiment, as thither the damsels came,"
5593,R E G I N.,And amid the hands of the foremost was the woven gold aflame.
5594,R E G I N.,
5595,R E G I N.,"""O daughters of earls,"" said the Helper, ""what tidings then do ye bear?"
5596,R E G I N.,"Is it grief in the merry morning, or joy or wonder or fear?"""
5597,R E G I N.,
5598,R E G I N.,"Quoth the first: ""It is grief for the foemen that the Masters of God-home"
5599,R E G I N.,"would grieve."""
5600,R E G I N.,
5601,R E G I N.,"Said the next: ""'Tis a wonder of wonders, that the hearkening world shall"

5606,R E G I N.,"""A joy of all joys,"" said the fourth, ""once come, it comes not again!"""
5607,R E G I N.,
5608,R E G I N.,"""Lo, son,"" said the ancient Helper, ""glad sit the earls and the lords!"
5609,R E G I N.,"Lookst thou not for a token of tidings to follow such-like words?"""
5610,R E G I N.,
5611,R E G I N.,"Saith King Elf: ""Great words of women! or great hath our dwelling become."""
5612,R E G I N.,
5613,R E G I N.,"Said the women: ""Words shall be greater, when all folk shall praise our"

5616,R E G I N.,"""What then hath betid,"" said King Elf, ""do the high Gods stand in our"

5670,R E G I N.,For the eyes of the child gleamed on him till he was as one who sees
5671,R E G I N.,The very Gods arising mid their carven images:
5672,R E G I N.,To his ears there came a murmur of far seas beneath the wind
5673,R E G I N.,And the tramp of fierce-eyed warriors through the outland forest blind;
5674,R E G I N.,"The sound of hosts of battle, cries round the hoisted shield,"
5675,R E G I N.,Low talk of the gathered wise-ones in the Goth-folk's holy field:
5676,R E G I N.,So the thought in a little moment through King Elf the Mighty ran
5677,R E G I N.,"Of the years and their building and burden, and toil of the sons of man,"
5678,R E G I N.,"The joy of folk and their sorrow, and the hope of deeds to do:"
5679,R E G I N.,"With the love of many peoples was the wise king smitten through,"
5680,R E G I N.,"As he hung o'er the new-born Volsung: but at last he raised his head,"

5709,R E G I N.,"Of all folk of the world was she well, and a soul fulfilled of rest"
5710,R E G I N.,As alone in the chamber she wakened and Sigurd cherished her breast.
5711,R E G I N.,
5712,R E G I N.,"But men feast in the merry noontide, and glad is the April green"
5713,R E G I N.,That a Volsung looks on the sunlight and the night and the darkness have
5714,R E G I N.,been.
5715,R E G I N.,"Earls think of marvellous stories, and along the golden strings"
5716,R E G I N.,Flit words of banded brethren and names of war-fain Kings:
5717,R E G I N.,All the days of the deeds of Sigmund who was born so long ago;
5718,R E G I N.,"All deeds of the glorious Signy, and her tarrying-tide of woe;"
5719,R E G I N.,"Men tell of the years of Volsung, and how long agone it was"
5720,R E G I N.,"That he changed his life in battle, and brought the tale to pass:"
5721,R E G I N.,"Then goeth the word of the Giants, and the world seems waxen old"
5722,R E G I N.,For the dimness of King Rerir and the tale of his warfare told:
5723,R E G I N.,"Yet unhushed are the singers' voices, nor yet the harp-strings cease"
5724,R E G I N.,"While yet is left a rumour of the mirk-wood's broken peace,"
5725,R E G I N.,"And of Sigi the very ancient, and the unnamed Sons of God,"
5726,R E G I N.,Of the days when the Lords of Heaven full oft the world-ways trod.
5727,R E G I N.,
5728,R E G I N.,"So stilleth the wind in the even and the sun sinks down in the sea,"
5729,R E G I N.,And men abide the morrow and the Victory yet to be.
5730,R E G I N.,
5731,R E G I N.,
5732,R E G I N.,_Sigurd getteth to him the horse that is called Greyfell._
5733,R E G I N.,
5734,R E G I N.,"Now waxeth the son of Sigmund in might and goodliness,"
5735,R E G I N.,"And soft the days win over, and all men his beauty bless."
5736,R E G I N.,But amidst the summer season was the Isle-queen Hiordis wed
5737,R E G I N.,"To King Elf the son of the Helper, and fair their life-days sped."
5738,R E G I N.,"Peace lay on the land for ever, and the fields gave good increase,"
5739,R E G I N.,And there was Sigurd waxing mid the plenty and the peace.
5740,R E G I N.,
5741,R E G I N.,"Now hath the child grown greater, and is keen and eager of wit"
5742,R E G I N.,"And full of understanding, and oft hath the joy to sit"
5743,R E G I N.,Amid talk of weighty matters when the wise men meet for speech;
5744,R E G I N.,And joyous he is moreover and blithe and kind with each.
5745,R E G I N.,"But Regin the wise craftsmaster heedeth the youngling well,"
5746,R E G I N.,"And before the Kings he cometh, and saith such words to tell."
5747,R E G I N.,
5748,R E G I N.,"""I have fostered thy youth, King Elf, and thine O Helper of men,"
5749,R E G I N.,And ye wot that such a master no king shall see again;
5750,R E G I N.,"And now would I foster Sigurd; for, though he be none of thy blood,"
5751,R E G I N.,"Mine heart of his days that shall be speaketh abundant good."""
5752,R E G I N.,
5753,R E G I N.,"Then spake the Helper of men-folk: ""Yea, do herein thy will:"
5754,R E G I N.,"For thou art the Master of Masters, and hast learned me all my skill:"
5755,R E G I N.,"But think how bright is this youngling, and thy guile from him withhold;"
5756,R E G I N.,"For this craft of thine hath shown me that thy heart is grim and cold,"
5757,R E G I N.,Though three men's lives thrice over thy wisdom might not learn;
5758,R E G I N.,"And I love this son of Sigmund, and mine heart to him doth yearn."""
5759,R E G I N.,
5760,R E G I N.,"Then Regin laughed, and answered: ""I doled out cunning to thee;"
5761,R E G I N.,"But nought with him will I measure: yet no cold-heart shall he be,"
5762,R E G I N.,"Nor grim, nor evil-natured: for whate'er my will might frame,"
5763,R E G I N.,"Gone forth is the word of the Norns, that abideth ever the same."
5764,R E G I N.,"And now, despite my cunning, how deem ye I shall die?"""
5765,R E G I N.,
5766,R E G I N.,"And they said he would live as he listed, and at last in peace should lie"
5767,R E G I N.,When he listed to live no longer; so mighty and wise he was.
5768,R E G I N.,"But again he laughed and answered: ""One day it shall come to pass,"
5769,R E G I N.,That a beardless youth shall slay me: I know the fateful doom;
5770,R E G I N.,"But nought may I withstand it, as it heaves up dim through the gloom."""
5771,R E G I N.,
5772,R E G I N.,"So is Sigurd now with Regin, and he learns him many things;"
5773,R E G I N.,"Yea, all save the craft of battle, that men learned the sons of kings:"
5774,R E G I N.,The smithying sword and war-coat; the carving runes aright;
5775,R E G I N.,"The tongues of many countries, and soft speech for men's delight;"
5776,R E G I N.,"The dealing with the harp-strings, and the winding ways of song."
5777,R E G I N.,"So wise of heart waxed Sigurd, and of body wondrous strong:"
5778,R E G I N.,"And he chased the deer of the forest, and many a wood-wolf slew,"
5779,R E G I N.,"And many a bull of the mountains: and the desert dales he knew,"
5780,R E G I N.,"And the heaths that the wind sweeps over; and seaward would he fare,"
5781,R E G I N.,"Far out from the outer skerries, and alone the sea-wights dare."
5782,R E G I N.,
5783,R E G I N.,"On a day he sat with Regin amidst the unfashioned gold,"
5784,R E G I N.,And the silver grey from the furnace; and Regin spake and told
5785,R E G I N.,"Sweet tales of the days that have been, and the Kings of the bold and"
5786,R E G I N.,wise;
5787,R E G I N.,Till the lad's heart swelled with longing and lit his sunbright eyes.
5788,R E G I N.,
5789,R E G I N.,"Then Regin looked upon him: ""Thou too shalt one day ride"
5790,R E G I N.,As the Volsung Kings went faring through the noble world and wide.
5791,R E G I N.,"For this land is nought and narrow, and Kings of the carles are these,"
5792,R E G I N.,"And their earls are acre-biders, and their hearts are dull with peace."""
5793,R E G I N.,
5794,R E G I N.,"But Sigurd knit his brows, and in wrathful wise he said:"
5795,R E G I N.,"""Ill words of those thou speakest that my youth have cherished,"
5796,R E G I N.,"And the friends that have made me merry, and the land that is fair and"
5797,R E G I N.,"good."""
5798,R E G I N.,
5799,R E G I N.,"Then Regin laughed and answered: ""Nay, well I see by thy mood"
5800,R E G I N.,That wide wilt thou ride in the world like thy kin of the earlier days:
5801,R E G I N.,And wilt thou be wroth with thy master that he longs for thy winning the
5802,R E G I N.,praise?
5803,R E G I N.,"And now if the sooth thou sayest, that these King-folk cherish thee well,"
5804,R E G I N.,Then let them give thee a gift whereof the world shall tell:
5805,R E G I N.,"Yea hearken to this my counsel, and crave for a battle-steed."""
5806,R E G I N.,
5807,R E G I N.,"Yet wroth was the lad and answered: ""I have many a horse to my need,"
5808,R E G I N.,"And all that the heart desireth, and what wouldst thou wish me more?"""
5809,R E G I N.,
5810,R E G I N.,"Then Regin answered and said: ""Thy kin of the Kings of yore"
5811,R E G I N.,Were the noblest men of men-folk; and their hearts would never rest
5812,R E G I N.,"Whatso of good they had gotten, if their hands held not the best."
5813,R E G I N.,"Now do thou after my counsel, and crave of thy fosterers here"
5814,R E G I N.,"That thou choose of the horses of Gripir whichso thine heart holds dear."""
5815,R E G I N.,
5816,R E G I N.,"He spake and his harp was with him, and he smote the strings full sweet,"
5817,R E G I N.,"And sang of the host of the Valkyrs, how they ride the battle to meet,"
5818,R E G I N.,And the dew from the dear manes drippeth as they ride in the first of
5819,R E G I N.,"the sun,"
5820,R E G I N.,And the tree-boughs open to meet it when the wind of the dawning is done:
5821,R E G I N.,"And the deep dales drink its sweetness and spring into blossoming grass,"
5822,R E G I N.,"And the earth groweth fruitful of men, and bringeth their glory to pass."
5823,R E G I N.,
5824,R E G I N.,"Then the wrath ran off from Sigurd, and he left the smithying stead"
5825,R E G I N.,While the song yet rang in the doorway: and that eve to the Kings he said:
5826,R E G I N.,"""Will ye do so much for mine asking as to give me a horse to my will?"
5827,R E G I N.,"For belike the days shall come, that shall all my heart fulfill,"
5828,R E G I N.,"And teach me the deeds of a king."""
5829,R E G I N.,Then answered King Elf and spake:
5830,R E G I N.,"""The stalls of the Kings are before thee to set aside or to take,"
5831,R E G I N.,"And nought we begrudge thee the best."""
5832,R E G I N.,Yet answered Sigurd again;
5833,R E G I N.,For his heart of the mountains aloft and the windy drift was fain:
5834,R E G I N.,"""Fair seats for the knees of Kings! but now do I ask for a gift"
5835,R E G I N.,"Such as all the world shall be praising, the best of the strong and"
5836,R E G I N.,the swift.
5837,R E G I N.,"Ye shall give me a token for Gripir, and bid him to let me choose"
5838,R E G I N.,From out of the noble stud-beasts that run in his meadow loose.
5839,R E G I N.,"But if overmuch I have asked you, forget this prayer of mine,"
5840,R E G I N.,"And deem the word unspoken, and get ye to the wine."""
5841,R E G I N.,
5842,R E G I N.,"Then smiled King Elf, and answered: ""A long way wilt thou ride,"
5843,R E G I N.,"To where unpeace and troubles and the griefs of the soul abide,"
5844,R E G I N.,Yea unto the death at the last: yet surely shalt thou win
5845,R E G I N.,The praise of many a people: so have thy way herein.
5846,R E G I N.,Forsooth no more may we hold thee than the hazel copse may hold
5847,R E G I N.,"The sun of the early dawning, that turneth it all unto gold."""
5848,R E G I N.,
5849,R E G I N.,Then sweetly Sigurd thanked them; and through the night he lay
5850,R E G I N.,Mid dreams of many a matter till the dawn was on the way;
5851,R E G I N.,"Then he shook the sleep from off him, and that dwelling of Kings he left"
5852,R E G I N.,And wended his ways unto Gripir. On a crag from the mountain reft
5853,R E G I N.,"Was the house of the old King builded; and a mighty house it was,"
5854,R E G I N.,Though few were the sons of men that over its threshold would pass:
5855,R E G I N.,"But the wild ernes cried about it, and the vultures toward it flew,"
5856,R E G I N.,And the winds from the heart of the mountains searched every chamber
5857,R E G I N.,"through,"
5858,R E G I N.,"And about were meads wide-spreading; and many a beast thereon,"
5859,R E G I N.,"Yea some that are men-folk's terror, their sport and pasture won."
5860,R E G I N.,So into the hall went Sigurd; and amidst was Gripir set
5861,R E G I N.,In a chair of the sea-beast's tooth; and his sweeping beard nigh met
5862,R E G I N.,"The floor that was green as the ocean, and his gown was of mountain-gold"
5863,R E G I N.,And the kingly staff in his hand was knobbed with the crystal cold.
5864,R E G I N.,
5865,R E G I N.,"Now the first of the twain spake Gripir: ""Hail King with the eyen bright!"
5866,R E G I N.,"Nought needest thou show the token, for I know of thy life and thy light."
5867,R E G I N.,"And no need to tell of thy message; it was wafted here on the wind,"
5868,R E G I N.,That thou wouldst be coming to-day a horse in my meadow to find:
5869,R E G I N.,And strong must he be for the bearing of those deeds of thine that shall
5870,R E G I N.,be.
5871,R E G I N.,"Now choose thou of all the way-wearers that are running loose in my lea,"
5872,R E G I N.,And be glad as thine heart will have thee and the fate that leadeth thee
5873,R E G I N.,"on,"
5874,R E G I N.,"And I bid thee again come hither when the sword of worth is won,"
5875,R E G I N.,And thy loins are girt for thy going on the road that before thee lies;
5876,R E G I N.,"For a glimmering over its darkness is come before mine eyes."""
5877,R E G I N.,
5878,R E G I N.,"Then again gat Sigurd outward, and adown the steep he ran"
5879,R E G I N.,"And unto the horse-fed meadow: but lo, a grey-clad man,"
5880,R E G I N.,"One-eyed and seeming-ancient, there met him by the way:"
5881,R E G I N.,"And he spake: ""Thou hastest, Sigurd; yet tarry till I say"
5882,R E G I N.,A word that shall well bestead thee: for I know of these mountains well
5883,R E G I N.,"And all the lea of Gripir, and the beasts that thereon dwell."""
5884,R E G I N.,
5885,R E G I N.,"""Wouldst thou have red gold for thy tidings? art thou Gripir's horse-herd"
5886,R E G I N.,then?
5887,R E G I N.,"Nay sure, for thy face is shining like battle-eager men"
5888,R E G I N.,My master Regin tells of: and I love thy cloud-grey gown
5889,R E G I N.,"And thy visage gleams above it like a thing my dreams have known."""
5890,R E G I N.,
5891,R E G I N.,"""Nay whiles have I heeded the horse-kind,"" then spake that elder of days,"
5892,R E G I N.,"""And sooth do the sages say, when the beasts of my breeding they praise."
5893,R E G I N.,"There is one thereof in the meadow, and, wouldst thou cull him out,"
5894,R E G I N.,"Thou shalt follow an elder's counsel, who hath brought strange things"
5895,R E G I N.,"about,"
5896,R E G I N.,"Who hath known thy father aforetime, and other kings of thy kin."""
5897,R E G I N.,
5898,R E G I N.,"So Sigurd said, ""I am ready; and what is the deed to win?"""
5899,R E G I N.,
5900,R E G I N.,"He said: ""We shall drive the horses adown to the water-side,"
5901,R E G I N.,"That cometh forth from the mountains, and note what next shall betide."""
5902,R E G I N.,
5903,R E G I N.,"Then the twain sped on together, and they drave the horses on"
5904,R E G I N.,Till they came to a rushing river a water wide and wan;
5905,R E G I N.,And the white mews hovered o'er it; but none might hear their cry
5906,R E G I N.,"For the rush and the rattle of waters, as the downlong flood swept by."
5907,R E G I N.,"So the whole herd took the river and strove the stream to stem,"
5908,R E G I N.,And many a brave steed was there; but the flood o'ermastered them:
5909,R E G I N.,"And some, it swept them down-ward, and some won back to bank,"
5910,R E G I N.,"Some, caught by the net of the eddies, in the swirling hubbub sank;"
5911,R E G I N.,"But one of all swam over, and they saw his mane of grey"
5912,R E G I N.,"Toss over the flowery meadows, a bright thing far away:"
5913,R E G I N.,"Wide then he wheeled about them, then took the stream again"
5914,R E G I N.,And with the waves' white horses mingled his cloudy mane.
5915,R E G I N.,
5916,R E G I N.,"Then spake the elder of days: ""Hearken now, Sigurd, and hear;"
5917,R E G I N.,"Time was when I gave thy father a gift thou shalt yet deem dear,"
5918,R E G I N.,And this horse is a gift of my giving:--heed nought where thou mayst ride:
5919,R E G I N.,"For I have seen thy fathers in a shining house abide,"
5920,R E G I N.,"And on earth they thought of its threshold, and the gifts I had to give;"
5921,R E G I N.,"Nor prayed for a little longer, and a little longer to live."""
5922,R E G I N.,
5923,R E G I N.,"Then forth he strode to the mountains, and fain was Sigurd now"
5924,R E G I N.,"To ask him many a matter: but dim did his bright shape grow,"
5925,R E G I N.,As a man from the litten doorway fades into the dusk of night;
5926,R E G I N.,"And the sun in the high-noon shone, and the world was exceeding bright."
5927,R E G I N.,
5928,R E G I N.,"So Sigurd turned to the river and stood by the wave-wet strand,"
5929,R E G I N.,"And the grey horse swims to his feet and lightly leaps aland,"
5930,R E G I N.,"And the youngling looks upon him, and deems none beside him good."
5931,R E G I N.,"And indeed, as tells the story, he was come of Sleipnir's blood,"
5932,R E G I N.,"The tireless horse of Odin: cloud-grey he was of hue,"
5933,R E G I N.,"And it seemed as Sigurd backed him that Sigmund's son he knew,"
5934,R E G I N.,So glad he went beneath him. Then the youngling's song arose
5935,R E G I N.,"As he brushed through the noon-tide blossoms of Gripir's mighty close,"
5936,R E G I N.,"Then he singeth the song of Greyfell, the horse that Odin gave,"
5937,R E G I N.,"Who swam through the sweeping river, and back through the toppling wave."
5938,R E G I N.,
5939,R E G I N.,
5940,R E G I N.,"_Regin telleth Sigurd of his kindred, and of the Gold that was"
5941,R E G I N.,accursed from ancient days._
5942,R E G I N.,
5943,R E G I N.,"Now yet the days pass over, and more than words may tell"
5944,R E G I N.,"Grows Sigurd strong and lovely, and all children love him well."
5945,R E G I N.,But oft he looks on the mountains and many a time is fain
5946,R E G I N.,"To know of what lies beyond them, and learn of the wide world's gain."
5947,R E G I N.,"And he saith: ""I dwell in a land that is ruled by none of my blood;"
5948,R E G I N.,"And my mother's sons are waxing, and fair kings shall they be and good;"
5949,R E G I N.,And their servant or their betrayer--not one of these will I be.
5950,R E G I N.,"Yet needs must I wait for a little till Odin calls for me."""
5951,R E G I N.,
5952,R E G I N.,Now again it happed on a day that he sat in Regin's hall
5953,R E G I N.,"And hearkened many tidings of what had chanced to fall,"
5954,R E G I N.,"And of kings that sought their kingdoms o'er many a waste and wild,"
5955,R E G I N.,And at last saith the crafty master:
5956,R E G I N.,"""Thou art King Sigmund's child:"
5957,R E G I N.,"Wilt thou wait till these kings of the carles shall die in a little land,"
5958,R E G I N.,Or wilt thou serve their sons and carry the cup to their hand;
5959,R E G I N.,"Or abide in vain for the day that never shall come about,"
5960,R E G I N.,When their banners shall dance in the wind and shake to the war-gods'
5961,R E G I N.,"shout?"""
5962,R E G I N.,
5963,R E G I N.,"Then Sigurd answered and said: ""Nought such do I look to be."
5964,R E G I N.,"But thou, a deedless man, too much thou eggest me:"
5965,R E G I N.,"And these folk are good and trusty, and the land is lovely and sweet,"
5966,R E G I N.,And in rest and in peace it lieth as the floor of Odin's feet:
5967,R E G I N.,"Yet I know that the world is wide, and filled with deeds unwrought;"
5968,R E G I N.,"And for e'en such work was I fashioned, lest the song-craft come to"
5969,R E G I N.,"nought,"
5970,R E G I N.,"When the harps of God-home tinkle, and the Gods are at stretch to"
5971,R E G I N.,hearken;
5972,R E G I N.,"Lest the hosts of the Gods be scanty when their day hath begun to darken,"
5973,R E G I N.,"When the bonds of the Wolf wax thin, and Loki fretteth his chain."
5974,R E G I N.,"And sure for the house of my fathers full oft my heart is fain,"
5975,R E G I N.,"And meseemeth I hear them talking of the day when I shall come,"
5976,R E G I N.,"And of all the burden of deeds, that my hand shall bear them home."
5977,R E G I N.,"And so when the deed is ready, nowise the man shall lack:"
5978,R E G I N.,"But the wary foot is the surest, and the hasty oft turns back."""
5979,R E G I N.,
5980,R E G I N.,"Then answered Regin the guileful: ""The deed is ready to hand,"
5981,R E G I N.,"Yet holding my peace is the best, for well thou lovest the land;"
5982,R E G I N.,"And thou lovest thy life moreover, and the peace of thy youthful days,"
5983,R E G I N.,And why should the full-fed feaster his hand to the rye-bread raise?
5984,R E G I N.,Yet they say that Sigmund begat thee and he looked to fashion a man.
5985,R E G I N.,"Fear nought; he lieth quiet in his mound by the sea-waves wan."""
5986,R E G I N.,
5987,R E G I N.,"So shone the eyes of Sigurd, that the shield against him hung"
5988,R E G I N.,Cast back their light as the sunbeams; but his voice to the roof-tree
5989,R E G I N.,rung:
5990,R E G I N.,"""Tell me, thou Master of Masters, what deed is the deed I shall do?"
5991,R E G I N.,"Nor mock thou the son of Sigmund lest the day of his birth thou rue."""
5992,R E G I N.,
5993,R E G I N.,"Then answered the Master of Sleight: ""The deed is the righting of wrong,"
5994,R E G I N.,"And the quelling a bale and a sorrow that the world hath endured o'erlong,"
5995,R E G I N.,"And the winning a treasure untold, that shall make thee more than the"
5996,R E G I N.,kings;
5997,R E G I N.,"Thereof is the Helm of Aweing, the wonder of earthly things,"
5998,R E G I N.,"And thereof is its very fellow, the War-coat all of gold,"
5999,R E G I N.,"That has not its like in the heavens, nor has earth of its fellow told."""
6000,R E G I N.,
6001,R E G I N.,"Then answered Sigurd the Volsung: ""How long hereof hast thou known?"
6002,R E G I N.,"And what unto thee is this treasure, that thou seemest to give as thine"
6003,R E G I N.,"own?"""
6004,R E G I N.,
6005,R E G I N.,"""Alas!"" quoth the smithying master, ""it is mine, yet none of mine"
6006,R E G I N.,"Since my heart herein avails not, and my hand is frail and fine--"
6007,R E G I N.,It is long since I first came hither to seek a man for my need;
6008,R E G I N.,"For I saw by a glimmering light that hence would spring the deed,"
6009,R E G I N.,"And many a deed of the world: but the generations passed,"
6010,R E G I N.,And the first of the days was as near to the end that I sought as the
6011,R E G I N.,last;
6012,R E G I N.,"Till I looked on thine eyes in the cradle: and now I deem through thee,"

6014,R E G I N.,
6015,R E G I N.,Then Sigurd awhile was silent; but at last he answered and said:
6016,R E G I N.,"""Thou shalt have thy will and the treasure, and shalt take the curse on"
6017,R E G I N.,thine head
6018,R E G I N.,"If a curse the gold enwrappeth: but the deed will I surely do,"
6019,R E G I N.,For to-day the dreams of my childhood have bloomed in my heart anew:
6020,R E G I N.,And I long to look on the world and the glory of the earth
6021,R E G I N.,"And to deal in the dealings of men, and garner the harvest of worth."
6022,R E G I N.,"But tell me, thou Master of Masters, where lieth this measureless wealth;"
6023,R E G I N.,"Is it guarded by swords of the earl-folk, or kept by cunning and stealth?"
6024,R E G I N.,"Is it over the main sea's darkness, or beyond the mountain wall?"
6025,R E G I N.,"Or e'en in these peaceful acres anigh to the hands of all?"""
6026,R E G I N.,
6027,R E G I N.,"Then Regin answered sweetly: ""Hereof must a tale be told:"
6028,R E G I N.,"Bide sitting, thou son of Sigmund, on the heap of unwrought gold,"
6029,R E G I N.,"And hearken of wondrous matters, and of things unheard, unsaid,"
6030,R E G I N.,And deeds of my beholding ere the first of Kings was made.
6031,R E G I N.,
6032,R E G I N.,"""And first ye shall know of a sooth, that I never was born of the race"
6033,R E G I N.,Which the masters of God-home have made to cover the fair earth's face;
6034,R E G I N.,But I come of the Dwarfs departed; and fair was the earth whileome
6035,R E G I N.,Ere the short-lived thralls of the Gods amidst its dales were come:--
6036,R E G I N.,"And how were we worse than the Gods, though maybe we lived not as long?"
6037,R E G I N.,Yet no weight of memory maimed us; nor aught we knew of wrong.
6038,R E G I N.,"What felt our souls of shaming, what knew our hearts of love?"
6039,R E G I N.,"We did and undid at pleasure, and repented nought thereof."
6040,R E G I N.,"--Yea we were exceeding mighty--bear with me yet, my son;"
6041,R E G I N.,For whiles can I scarcely think it that our days are wholly done.
6042,R E G I N.,And trust not thy life in my hands in the day when most I seem
6043,R E G I N.,"Like the Dwarfs that are long departed, and most of my kindred I dream."
6044,R E G I N.,
6045,R E G I N.,"""So as we dwelt came tidings that the Gods amongst us were,"
6046,R E G I N.,"And the people come from Asgard: then rose up hope and fear,"
6047,R E G I N.,"And strange shapes of things went flitting betwixt the night and the eve,"
6048,R E G I N.,"And our sons waxed wild and wrathful, and our daughters learned to grieve."
6049,R E G I N.,"Then we fell to the working of metal, and the deeps of the earth would"
6050,R E G I N.,"know,"
6051,R E G I N.,"And we dealt with venom and leechcraft, and we fashioned spear and bow,"
6052,R E G I N.,"And we set the ribs to the oak-keel, and looked on the landless sea;"
6053,R E G I N.,And the world began to be such-like as the Gods would have it to be.
6054,R E G I N.,In the womb of the woeful Earth had they quickened the grief and the gold.
6055,R E G I N.,
6056,R E G I N.,"""It was Reidmar the Ancient begat me; and now was he waxen old,"
6057,R E G I N.,"And a covetous man and a king; and he bade, and I built him a hall,"
6058,R E G I N.,"And a golden glorious house; and thereto his sons did he call,"
6059,R E G I N.,"And he bade them be evil and wise, that his will through them might be"
6060,R E G I N.,wrought.
6061,R E G I N.,"Then he gave unto Fafnir my brother the soul that feareth nought,"
6062,R E G I N.,"And the brow of the hardened iron, and the hand that may never fail,"
6063,R E G I N.,"And the greedy heart of a king, and the ear that hears no wail."
6064,R E G I N.,
6065,R E G I N.,"""But next unto Otter my brother he gave the snare and the net"
6066,R E G I N.,"And the longing to wend through the wild-wood, and wade the highways wet:"
6067,R E G I N.,"And the foot that never resteth, while aught be left alive"
6068,R E G I N.,That hath cunning to match man's cunning or might with his might to
6069,R E G I N.,strive.
6070,R E G I N.,
6071,R E G I N.,"""And to me, the least and the youngest, what gift for the slaying of ease?"
6072,R E G I N.,"Save the grief that remembers the past, and the fear that the future sees;"
6073,R E G I N.,"And the hammer and fashioning-iron, and the living coal of fire;"
6074,R E G I N.,"And the craft that createth a semblance, and fails of the heart's desire;"
6075,R E G I N.,"And the toil that each dawning quickens and the task that is never done,"
6076,R E G I N.,"And the heart that longeth ever, nor will look to the deed that is won."
6077,R E G I N.,
6078,R E G I N.,"""Thus gave my father the gifts that might never be taken again;"
6079,R E G I N.,"Far worse were we now than the Gods, and but little better than men."
6080,R E G I N.,But yet of our ancient might one thing had we left us still:
6081,R E G I N.,"We had craft to change our semblance, and could shift us at our will"
6082,R E G I N.,"Into bodies of the beast-kind, or fowl, or fishes cold;"
6083,R E G I N.,"For belike no fixed semblance we had in the days of old,"
6084,R E G I N.,"Till the Gods were waxen busy, and all things their form must take"
6085,R E G I N.,"That knew of good and evil, and longed to gather and make."
6086,R E G I N.,
6087,R E G I N.,*     *     *     *     *
6088,R E G I N.,
6089,R E G I N.,"""So dwelt we, brethren and father; and Fafnir my brother fared"
6090,R E G I N.,"As the scourge and compeller of all things, and left no wrong undared;"
6091,R E G I N.,"But for me, I toiled and I toiled; and fair grew my father's house;"
6092,R E G I N.,But writhen and foul were the hands that had made it glorious;
6093,R E G I N.,"And the love of women left me, and the fame of sword and shield:"
6094,R E G I N.,"And the sun and the winds of heaven, and the fowl and the grass of the"
6095,R E G I N.,field
6096,R E G I N.,"Were grown as the tools of my smithy; and all the world I knew,"
6097,R E G I N.,"And the glories that lie beyond it, and whitherward all things drew;"
6098,R E G I N.,"And myself a little fragment amidst it all I saw,"
6099,R E G I N.,"Grim, cold-heart, and unmighty as the tempest-driven straw."
6100,R E G I N.,"--Let be.--For Otter my brother saw seldom field or fold,"
6101,R E G I N.,"And he oftenest used that custom, whereof e'en now I told,"
6102,R E G I N.,And would shift his shape with the wood-beasts and the things of land
6103,R E G I N.,and sea;
6104,R E G I N.,"And he knew what joy their hearts had, and what they longed to be,"
6105,R E G I N.,"And their dim-eyed understanding, and his wood-craft waxed so great,"
6106,R E G I N.,That he seemed the king of the creatures and their very mortal fate.
6107,R E G I N.,
6108,R E G I N.,"""Now as the years won over three folk of the heavenly halls"
6109,R E G I N.,"Grew aweary of sleepless sloth, and the day that nought befalls;"
6110,R E G I N.,"And they fain would look on the earth, and their latest handiwork,"
6111,R E G I N.,"And turn the fine gold over, lest a flaw therein should lurk."
6112,R E G I N.,"And the three were the heart-wise Odin, the Father of the Slain,"
6113,R E G I N.,"And Loki, the World's Begrudger, who maketh all labour vain,"
6114,R E G I N.,"And Hænir, the Utter-Blameless, who wrought the hope of man,"
6115,R E G I N.,"And his heart and inmost yearnings, when first the work began;--"
6116,R E G I N.,"--The God that was aforetime, and hereafter yet shall be"
6117,R E G I N.,When the new light yet undreamed of shall shine o'er earth and sea.
6118,R E G I N.,
6119,R E G I N.,"""Thus about the world they wended and deemed it fair and good,"
6120,R E G I N.,"And they loved their life-days dearly: so came they to the wood,"
6121,R E G I N.,"And the lea without a shepherd and the dwellings of the deer,"
6122,R E G I N.,And unto a mighty water that ran from a fathomless mere.
6123,R E G I N.,Now that flood my brother Otter had haunted many a day
6124,R E G I N.,For its plenteous fruit of fishes; and there on the bank he lay
6125,R E G I N.,"As the Gods came wandering thither; and he slept, and in his dreams"
6126,R E G I N.,"He saw the downlong river, and its fishy-peopled streams,"
6127,R E G I N.,"And the swift smooth heads of its forces, and its swirling wells and deep,"
6128,R E G I N.,"Where hang the poisèd fishes, and their watch in the rock-halls keep."
6129,R E G I N.,"And so, as he thought of it all, and its deeds and its wanderings,"
6130,R E G I N.,"Whereby it ran to the sea down the road of scaly things,"
6131,R E G I N.,"His body was changed with his thought, as yet was the wont of our kind,"
6132,R E G I N.,And he grew but an Otter indeed; and his eyes were sleeping and blind
6133,R E G I N.,"The while he devoured the prey, a golden red-flecked trout."
6134,R E G I N.,"Then passed by Odin and Hænir, nor cumbered their souls with doubt;"
6135,R E G I N.,"But Loki lingered a little, and guile in his heart arose,"
6136,R E G I N.,"And he saw through the shape of the Otter, and beheld a chief of his foes,"
6137,R E G I N.,"A king of the free and the careless: so he called up his baleful might,"
6138,R E G I N.,"And gathered his godhead together, and tore a shard outright"
6139,R E G I N.,"From the rock-wall of the river, and across its green wells cast;"
6140,R E G I N.,"And roaring over the waters that bolt of evil passed,"
6141,R E G I N.,"And smote my brother Otter that his heart's life fled away,"
6142,R E G I N.,"And bore his man's shape with it, and beast-like there he lay,"
6143,R E G I N.,"Stark dead on the sun-lit blossoms: but the Evil God rejoiced,"
6144,R E G I N.,And because of the sound of his singing the wild grew many-voiced.
6145,R E G I N.,
6146,R E G I N.,"""Then the three Gods waded the river, and no word Hænir spake,"
6147,R E G I N.,"For his thoughts were set on God-home, and the day that is ever awake."
6148,R E G I N.,"But Odin laughed in his wrath, and murmured: 'Ah, how long,"
6149,R E G I N.,Till the iron shall ring on the anvil for the shackles of thy wrong!'
6150,R E G I N.,
6151,R E G I N.,"""Then Loki takes up the quarry, and is e'en as a man again;"
6152,R E G I N.,And the three wend on through the wild-wood till they come to a grassy
6153,R E G I N.,plain
6154,R E G I N.,"Beneath the untrodden mountains; and lo! a noble house,"
6155,R E G I N.,"And a hall with great craft fashioned, and made full glorious;"
6156,R E G I N.,But night on the earth was falling; so scantly might they see
6157,R E G I N.,The wealth of its smooth-wrought stonework and its world of imagery:
6158,R E G I N.,"Then Loki bade turn thither since day was at an end,"
6159,R E G I N.,And into that noble dwelling the lords of God-home wend;
6160,R E G I N.,"And the porch was fair and mighty, and so smooth-wrought was its gold,"
6161,R E G I N.,That the mirrored stars of heaven therein might ye behold:
6162,R E G I N.,"But the hall, what words shall tell it, how fair it rose aloft,"
6163,R E G I N.,"And the marvels of its windows, and its golden hangings soft,"
6164,R E G I N.,And the forest of its pillars! and each like the wave's heart shone
6165,R E G I N.,And the mirrored boughs of the garden were dancing fair thereon.
6166,R E G I N.,"--Long years agone was it builded, and where are its wonders now?"
6167,R E G I N.,
6168,R E G I N.,"""Now the men of God-home marvelled, and gazed through the golden glow,"
6169,R E G I N.,And a man like a covetous king amidst of the hall they saw;
6170,R E G I N.,"And his chair was the tooth of the whale, wrought smooth with never a"
6171,R E G I N.,flaw;
6172,R E G I N.,"And his gown was the sea-born purple, and he bore a crown on his head,"
6173,R E G I N.,"But never a sword was before him: kind-seeming words he said,"
6174,R E G I N.,And bade rest to the weary feet that had worn the wild so long.
6175,R E G I N.,"So they sat, and were men by seeming; and there rose up music and song,"
6176,R E G I N.,And they ate and drank and were merry: but amidst the glee of the cup
6177,R E G I N.,"They felt themselves tangled and caught, as when the net cometh up"
6178,R E G I N.,"Before the folk of the 'firth, and the main sea lieth far off;"
6179,R E G I N.,"And the laughter of lips they hearkened, and that hall-abider's scoff,"
6180,R E G I N.,"As his face and his mocking eyes anigh to their faces drew,"
6181,R E G I N.,"And their godhead was caught in the net, and no shift of creation they"
6182,R E G I N.,knew
6183,R E G I N.,To escape from their man-like bodies; so great that day was the Earth.
6184,R E G I N.,
6185,R E G I N.,"""Then spake the hall-abider: 'Where then is thy guileful mirth,"
6186,R E G I N.,"And thy hall-glee gone, O Loki? Come, Hænir, fashion now"
6187,R E G I N.,"My heart for love and for hope, that the fear in my body may grow,"
6188,R E G I N.,"That I may grieve and be sorry, that the ruth may arise in me,"
6189,R E G I N.,"As thou dealtst with the first of men-folk, when a master-smith thou"

6191,R E G I N.,"And thou, Allfather Odin, hast thou come on a bastard brood?"
6192,R E G I N.,"Or hadst thou belike a brother, thy twin for evil and good,"
6193,R E G I N.,"That waked amidst thy slumber, and slumbered midst thy work?"
6194,R E G I N.,"Nay, Wise-one, art thou silent as a child amidst the mirk?"
6195,R E G I N.,"Ah, I know ye are called the Gods, and are mighty men at home,"
6196,R E G I N.,"But now with a guilt on your heads to no feeble folk are ye come,"
6197,R E G I N.,To a folk that need you nothing: time was when we knew you not:
6198,R E G I N.,"Yet e'en then fresh was the winter, and the summer sun was hot,"
6199,R E G I N.,"And the wood-meats stayed our hunger, and the water quenched our thirst,"
6200,R E G I N.,Ere the good and the evil wedded and begat the best and the worst.
6201,R E G I N.,"And how if to-day I undo it, that work of your fashioning,"
6202,R E G I N.,"If the web of the world run backward, and the high heavens lack a King?"
6203,R E G I N.,--Woe's me! for your ancient mastery shall help you at your need:
6204,R E G I N.,"If ye fill up the gulf of my longing and my empty heart of greed,"
6205,R E G I N.,"And slake the flame ye have quickened, then may ye go your ways"
6206,R E G I N.,And get ye back to your kingship and the driving on of the days
6207,R E G I N.,"To the day of the gathered war-hosts, and the tide of your Fateful Gloom."
6208,R E G I N.,"Now nought may ye gainsay it that my mouth must speak the doom,"
6209,R E G I N.,"For ye wot well I am Reidmar, and that there ye lie red-hand"
6210,R E G I N.,"From the slaughtering of my offspring, and the spoiling of my land;"
6211,R E G I N.,For his death of my wold hath bereft me and every highway wet.
6212,R E G I N.,"--Nay, Loki, naught avails it, well-fashioned is the net."
6213,R E G I N.,"Come forth, my son, my war-god, and show the Gods their work,"

6346,R E G I N.,"And the walls shone bright, and brighter than the sun of the upper air."
6347,R E G I N.,How great was that treasure of treasures: and the Helm of Dread was there;
6348,R E G I N.,The world but in dreams had seen it; and there was the hauberk of gold;
6349,R E G I N.,"None other is in the heavens, nor has earth of its fellow told."
6350,R E G I N.,
6351,R E G I N.,"""Then Loki bade the Elf-king bring all to the upper day,"

6368,R E G I N.,"How that gold was the seed of gold to the wise and the shapers of things,"
6369,R E G I N.,"The hoarders of hidden treasure, and the unseen glory of rings;"

6371,R E G I N.,And grief to the generations that die and spring again:
6372,R E G I N.,Then he cried:

6382,R E G I N.,
6383,R E G I N.,"""But Loki laughed in silence, and swift in Godhead went,"

6386,R E G I N.,"'Twas as if the sun were minded to live 'twixt wall and wall,"
6387,R E G I N.,And all we stood by and panted. Then Odin spake and said:

6389,R E G I N.,"""'O Kings, O folk of the Dwarf-kind, lo, the ransom duly paid!"
6390,R E G I N.,"Will ye have this sun of the ocean, and reap the fruitful field,"
6391,R E G I N.,And garner up the harvest that earth therefrom shall yield?'
6392,R E G I N.,
6393,R E G I N.,"""So he spake; but a little season nought answered Reidmar the wise"

6395,R E G I N.,"Endlong the hall and athwart it, as a man may chase about"
6396,R E G I N.,A ray of the sun of the morning that a naked sword throws out;
6397,R E G I N.,"And lo! from Loki's right-hand came the flash of the fruitful ring,"
6398,R E G I N.,And at last spake Reidmar scowling:
6399,R E G I N.,'Ye wait for my yea-saying
6400,R E G I N.,"That your feet may go free on the earth, and the fear of my toils may"
6401,R E G I N.,be done;
6402,R E G I N.,That then ye may say in your laughter: The fools of the time agone!
6403,R E G I N.,The purblind eyes of the Dwarf-kind! they have gotten the garnered sheaf
6404,R E G I N.,And have let their Masters depart with the Seed of Gold and of Grief:
6405,R E G I N.,"O Loki, friend of Allfather, cast down Andvari's Ring,"
6406,R E G I N.,Or the world shall yet turn backward and the high heavens lack a king.'
6407,R E G I N.,
6408,R E G I N.,"""Then Loki drew off the Elf-ring and cast it down on the heap,"
6409,R E G I N.,And forth as the gold met gold did the light of its glory leap:
6410,R E G I N.,"But he spake: 'It rejoiceth my heart that no whit of all ye shall lack,"
6411,R E G I N.,"Lest the curse of the Elf-king cleave not, and ye 'scape the utter wrack.'"
6412,R E G I N.,
6413,R E G I N.,"""Then laughed and answered Reidmar: 'I shall have it while I live,"
6414,R E G I N.,"And that shall be long, meseemeth: for who is there may strive"
6415,R E G I N.,"With my sword, the war-wise Fafnir, and my shield that is Regin the Smith?"
6416,R E G I N.,"But if indeed I should die, then let men-folk deal therewith,"
6417,R E G I N.,And ride to the golden glitter through evil deeds and good.
6418,R E G I N.,"I will have my heart's desire, and do as the high Gods would.'"
6419,R E G I N.,
6420,R E G I N.,"""Then I loosed the Gods from their shackles, and great they grew on"

6422,R E G I N.,"And into the night they gat them; but Odin turned by the door,"
6423,R E G I N.,"And we looked not, little we heeded, for we grudged his mastery;"
6424,R E G I N.,"Then he spake, and his voice was waxen as the voice of the winter sea:"
6425,R E G I N.,
6426,R E G I N.,"""'O Kings, O folk of the Dwarfs, why then will ye covet and rue?"
6427,R E G I N.,I have seen your fathers' fathers and the dust wherefrom they grew;
6428,R E G I N.,But who hath heard of my father or the land where first I sprung?
6429,R E G I N.,"Who knoweth my day of repentance, or the year when I was young?"

6431,R E G I N.,"Who hath gone before to teach him, and the doom of days fulfill?"
6432,R E G I N.,"Lo, I look on the Curse of the Gold, and wrong amended by wrong,"
6433,R E G I N.,"And love by love confounded, and the strong abased by the strong;"
6434,R E G I N.,"And I order it all and amend it, and the deeds that are done I see,"
6435,R E G I N.,And none other beholdeth or knoweth; and who shall be wise unto me?
6436,R E G I N.,"For myself to myself I offered, that all wisdom I might know,"
6437,R E G I N.,"And fruitful I waxed of works, and good and fair did they grow;"
6438,R E G I N.,"And I knew, and I wrought and fore-ordered; and evil sat by my side,"
6439,R E G I N.,"And myself by myself hath been doomed, and I look for the fateful tide;"
6440,R E G I N.,"And I deal with the generations, and the men mine hand hath made,"

6443,R E G I N.,
6444,R E G I N.,"""They went and the Gold abided: but the words Allfather spake,"
6445,R E G I N.,"I call them back full often for that golden even's sake,"
6446,R E G I N.,"Yet little that hour I heard them, save as wind across the lea;"
6447,R E G I N.,For the gold shone up on Reidmar and on Fafnir's face and on me.
6448,R E G I N.,"And sore I loved that treasure: so I wrapped my heart in guile,"
6449,R E G I N.,"And sleeked my tongue with sweetness, and set my face in a smile,"
6450,R E G I N.,"And I bade my father keep it, the more part of the gold,"
6451,R E G I N.,"Yet give good store to Fafnir for his goodly help and bold,"
6452,R E G I N.,And deal me a little handful for my smithying-help that day.
6453,R E G I N.,"But no little I desired, though for little I might pray;"
6454,R E G I N.,"And prayed I for much or for little, he answered me no more"
6455,R E G I N.,Than the shepherd answers the wood-wolf who howls at the yule-tide door:
6456,R E G I N.,"But good he ever deemed it to sit on his ivory throne,"
6457,R E G I N.,"And stare on the red rings' glory, and deem he was ever alone:"
6458,R E G I N.,"And never a word spake Fafnir, but his eyes waxed red and grim"
6459,R E G I N.,"As he looked upon our father, and noted the ways of him."
6460,R E G I N.,
6461,R E G I N.,"""The night waned into the morning, and still above the Hoard"
6462,R E G I N.,"Sat Reidmar clad in purple; but Fafnir took his sword,"
6463,R E G I N.,"And I took my smithying-hammer, and apart in the world we went;"
6464,R E G I N.,"But I came aback in the even, and my heart was heavy and spent;"
6465,R E G I N.,"And I longed, but fear was upon me and I durst not go to the Gold;"
6466,R E G I N.,So I lay in the house of my toil mid the things I had fashioned of old;
6467,R E G I N.,And methought as I lay in my bed 'twixt waking and slumber of night
6468,R E G I N.,"That I heard the tinkling metal and beheld the hall alight,"
6469,R E G I N.,"But I slept and dreamed of the Gods, and the things that never have slept,"
6470,R E G I N.,"Till I woke to a cry and a clashing and forth from the bed I leapt,"
6471,R E G I N.,"And there by the heaped-up Elf-gold my brother Fafnir stood,"
6472,R E G I N.,And there at his feet lay Reidmar and reddened the Treasure with blood;
6473,R E G I N.,"And e'en as I looked on his eyen they glazed and whitened with death,"
6474,R E G I N.,And forth on the torch-litten hall he shed his latest breath.
6475,R E G I N.,
6476,R E G I N.,"""But I looked on Fafnir and trembled for he wore the Helm of Dread,"
6477,R E G I N.,"And his sword was bare in his hand, and the sword and the hand were red"
6478,R E G I N.,"With the blood of our father Reidmar, and his body was wrapped in gold,"
6479,R E G I N.,"With the ruddy-gleaming mailcoat of whose fellow hath nought been told,"
6480,R E G I N.,And it seemed as I looked upon him that he grew beneath mine eyes:
6481,R E G I N.,And then in the mid-hall's silence did his dreadful voice arise:
6482,R E G I N.,
6483,R E G I N.,"""'I have slain my father Reidmar, that I alone might keep"
6484,R E G I N.,"The Gold of the darksome places, the Candle of the Deep."
6485,R E G I N.,"I am such as the Gods have made me, lest the Dwarf-kind people the earth,"
6486,R E G I N.,Or mingle their ancient wisdom with its short-lived latest birth.
6487,R E G I N.,"I shall dwell alone henceforward, and the Gold and its waxing curse,"
6488,R E G I N.,"I shall brood on them both together, let my life grow better or worse."
6489,R E G I N.,"And I am a King henceforward and long shall be my life,"
6490,R E G I N.,"And the Gold shall grow with my longing, for I shall hide it from strife,"
6491,R E G I N.,And hoard up the Ring of Andvari in the house thine hand hath built.
6492,R E G I N.,"O thou, wilt thou tarry and tarry, till I cast thy blood on the guilt?"
6493,R E G I N.,"Lo, I am a King for ever, and alone on the Gold shall I dwell"
6494,R E G I N.,And do no deed to repent of and leave no tale to tell.'
6495,R E G I N.,
6496,R E G I N.,"""More awful grew his visage as he spake the word of dread"
6497,R E G I N.,"And no more durst I behold him, but with heart a-cold I fled;"
6498,R E G I N.,"I fled from the glorious house my hands had made so fair,"
6499,R E G I N.,As poor as the new-born baby with nought of raiment or gear:
6500,R E G I N.,"I fled from the heaps of gold, and my goods were the eager will,"
6501,R E G I N.,"And the heart that remembereth all, and the hand that may never be still."
6502,R E G I N.,
6503,R E G I N.,"""Then unto this land I came, and that was long ago"
6504,R E G I N.,"As men-folk count the years; and I taught them to reap and to sow,"
6505,R E G I N.,"And a famous man I became: but that generation died,"
6506,R E G I N.,"And they said that Frey had taught them, and a God my name did hide."
6507,R E G I N.,"Then I taught them the craft of metals, and the sailing of the sea,"
6508,R E G I N.,"And the taming of the horse-kind, and the yoke-beasts' husbandry,"
6509,R E G I N.,"And the building up of houses; and that race of men went by,"
6510,R E G I N.,And they said that Thor had taught them; and a smithying-carle was I.
6511,R E G I N.,"Then I gave their maidens the needle and I bade them hold the rock,"
6512,R E G I N.,And the shuttle-race gaped for them as they sat at the weaving-stock.
6513,R E G I N.,"But by then these were waxen crones to sit dim-eyed by the door,"
6514,R E G I N.,It was Freyia had come among them to teach the weaving-lore.
6515,R E G I N.,
6516,R E G I N.,"""Then I taught them the tales of old, and fair songs fashioned and true,"
6517,R E G I N.,"And their speech grew into music of measured time and due,"
6518,R E G I N.,"And they smote the harp to my bidding, and the land grew soft and sweet:"
6519,R E G I N.,"But ere the grass of their grave-mounds rose up above my feet,"
6520,R E G I N.,"It was Bragi had made them sweet-mouthed, and I was the wandering scald;"
6521,R E G I N.,"Yet green did my cunning flourish by whatso name I was called,"
6522,R E G I N.,And I grew the master of masters--Think thou how strange it is
6523,R E G I N.,That the sword in the hands of a stripling shall one day end all this!
6524,R E G I N.,
6525,R E G I N.,"""Yet oft mid all my wisdom did I long for my brother's part,"
6526,R E G I N.,And Fafnir's mighty kingship weighed heavy on my heart
6527,R E G I N.,When the Kings of the earthly kingdoms would give me golden gifts
6528,R E G I N.,"From out of their scanty treasures, due pay for my cunning shifts."
6529,R E G I N.,And once--didst thou number the years thou wouldst think it long ago--
6530,R E G I N.,I wandered away to the country from whence our stem did grow.
6531,R E G I N.,"There methought the fells grown greater, but waste did the meadows lie"
6532,R E G I N.,And the house was rent and ragged and open to the sky.
6533,R E G I N.,"But lo, when I came to the doorway, great silence brooded there,"
6534,R E G I N.,"Nor bat nor owl would haunt it, nor the wood-wolves drew anear."
6535,R E G I N.,"Then I went to the pillared hall-stead, and lo, huge heaps of gold,"
6536,R E G I N.,And to and fro amidst them a mighty Serpent rolled:
6537,R E G I N.,"Then my heart grew chill with terror, for I thought on the wont of our"
6538,R E G I N.,"race,"
6539,R E G I N.,"And I, who had lost their cunning, was a man in a deadly place,"
6540,R E G I N.,A feeble man and a swordless in the lone destroyer's fold;
6541,R E G I N.,"For I knew that the Worm was Fafnir, the Wallower on the Gold."
6542,R E G I N.,
6543,R E G I N.,"""So I gathered my strength and fled, and hid my shame again"
6544,R E G I N.,"Mid the foolish sons of men-folk; and the more my hope was vain,"
6545,R E G I N.,"The more I longed for the Treasure, and deliv'rance from the yoke:"
6546,R E G I N.,"And yet passed the generations, and I dwelt with the short-lived folk."
6547,R E G I N.,
6548,R E G I N.,"""Long years, and long years after the tale of men-folk told"
6549,R E G I N.,"How up on the Glittering Heath was the house and the dwelling of gold,"
6550,R E G I N.,"And within that house was the Serpent, and the Lord of the Fearful Face:"
6551,R E G I N.,Then I wondered sore of the desert; for I thought of the golden place
6552,R E G I N.,My hands of old had builded; for I knew by many a sign
6553,R E G I N.,"That the Fearful Face was my brother, that the blood"
6554,R E G I N.,of the Worm was mine.
6555,R E G I N.,
6556,R E G I N.,"""This was ages long ago, and yet in that desert he dwells,"
6557,R E G I N.,"Betwixt him and men death lieth, and no man of his semblance tells;"
6558,R E G I N.,But the tale of the great Gold-wallower is never the more outworn.
6559,R E G I N.,"Then came thy kin, O Sigurd, and thy father's father was born,"
6560,R E G I N.,"And I fell to the dreaming of dreams, and I saw thine eyes therein,"
6561,R E G I N.,And I looked and beheld thy glory and all that thy sword should win;
6562,R E G I N.,"And I thought that thou shouldst be he, who should bring my heart its"
6563,R E G I N.,"rest,"
6564,R E G I N.,That of all the gifts of the Kings thy sword should give me the best.
6565,R E G I N.,
6566,R E G I N.,"""Ah, I fell to the dreaming of dreams; and oft the gold I saw,"
6567,R E G I N.,"And the golden-fashioned Hauberk, clean-wrought without a flaw,"
6568,R E G I N.,And the Helm that aweth the world; and I knew of Fafnir's heart
6569,R E G I N.,"That his wisdom was greater than mine, because he had held him apart,"
6570,R E G I N.,"Nor spilt on the sons of men-folk our knowledge of ancient days,"
6571,R E G I N.,"Nor bartered one whit for their love, nor craved for the people's praise."
6572,R E G I N.,
6573,R E G I N.,"""And some day I shall have it all, his gold and his craft and his heart"
6574,R E G I N.,And the gathered and garnered wisdom he guards in the mountains apart.
6575,R E G I N.,"And then when my hand is upon it, my hand shall be as the spring"
6576,R E G I N.,To thaw his winter away and the fruitful tide to bring.
6577,R E G I N.,"It shall grow, it shall grow into summer, and I shall be he that wrought,"
6578,R E G I N.,"And my deeds shall be remembered, and my name that once was nought;"
6579,R E G I N.,"Yea I shall be Frey, and Thor, and Freyia, and Bragi in one:"
6580,R E G I N.,"Yea the God of all that is,--and no deed in the wide world done,"
6581,R E G I N.,But the deed that my heart would fashion: and the songs of the freed
6582,R E G I N.,from the yoke
6583,R E G I N.,Shall bear to my house in the heavens the love and the longing of folk;
6584,R E G I N.,"And there shall be no more dying, and the sea shall be as the land,"
6585,R E G I N.,"And the world for ever and ever shall be young beneath my hand."""
6586,R E G I N.,
6587,R E G I N.,"Then his eyelids fell, and he slumbered, and it seemed as Sigurd gazed"
6588,R E G I N.,"That the flames leapt up in the stithy and about the Master blazed,"
6589,R E G I N.,And his hand in the harp-strings wandered and the sweetness from them
6590,R E G I N.,poured.
6591,R E G I N.,"Then unto his feet leapt Sigurd and drew his stripling's sword,"
6592,R E G I N.,"And he cried: ""Awake, O Master, for, lo, the day goes by,"
6593,R E G I N.,"And this too is an ancient story, that the sons of men-folk die,"
6594,R E G I N.,"And all save fame departeth. Awake! for the day grows late,"
6595,R E G I N.,"And deeds by the door are passing, nor the Norns will have them wait."""
6596,R E G I N.,
6597,R E G I N.,"Then Regin groaned and wakened, sad-eyed and heavy-browed,"
6598,R E G I N.,"And weary and worn was he waxen, as a man by a burden bowed:"
6599,R E G I N.,"And he spake: ""Hast thou hearkened, Sigurd, wilt thou help a man that"
6600,R E G I N.,is old
6601,R E G I N.,To avenge him for his father? Wilt thou win that Treasure of Gold
6602,R E G I N.,And be more than the Kings of the earth? Wilt thou rid the earth of a
6603,R E G I N.,wrong
6604,R E G I N.,"And heal the woe and the sorrow my heart hath endured o'erlong?"""
6605,R E G I N.,
6606,R E G I N.,"Then Sigurd looked upon him with steadfast eyes and clear,"
6607,R E G I N.,And Regin drooped and trembled as he stood the doom to hear:
6608,R E G I N.,"But the bright child spake as aforetime, and answered the Master and said:"
6609,R E G I N.,"""Thou shalt have thy will, and the Treasure, and take the curse on"
6610,R E G I N.,"thine head."""
6611,R E G I N.,
6612,R E G I N.,
6613,R E G I N.,_Of the forging of the Sword that is called The Wrath of Sigurd._
6614,R E G I N.,
6615,R E G I N.,"Now again came Sigurd to Regin, and said: ""Thou hast taught me a task"
6616,R E G I N.,"Whereof none knoweth the ending: and a gift at thine hands I ask."""
6617,R E G I N.,
6618,R E G I N.,"Then answered Regin the Master: ""The world must be wide indeed"
6619,R E G I N.,"If my hand may not reach across it for aught thine heart may need."""
6620,R E G I N.,
6621,R E G I N.,"""Yea wide is the world,"" said Sigurd, ""and soon spoken is thy word;"
6622,R E G I N.,But this gift thou shalt nought gainsay me: for I bid thee forge me a
6623,R E G I N.,"sword."""
6624,R E G I N.,
6625,R E G I N.,"Then spake the Master of Masters, and his voice was sweet and soft,"
6626,R E G I N.,"""Look forth abroad, O Sigurd, and note in the heavens aloft"
6627,R E G I N.,How the dim white moon of the daylight hangs round as the Goth-God's
6628,R E G I N.,shield:
6629,R E G I N.,Now for thee first rang mine anvil when she walked the heavenly field
6630,R E G I N.,"A slim and lovely lady, and the old moon lay on her arm:"
6631,R E G I N.,"Lo, here is a sword I have wrought thee with many a spell and charm"
6632,R E G I N.,And all the craft of the Dwarf-kind; be glad thereof and sure;
6633,R E G I N.,"Mid many a storm of battle full well shall it endure."""
6634,R E G I N.,
6635,R E G I N.,"Then Sigurd looked on the slayer, and never a word would speak:"
6636,R E G I N.,"Gemmed were the hilts and golden, and the blade was blue and bleak,"
6637,R E G I N.,And runes of the Dwarf-kind's cunning each side the trench were scored:
6638,R E G I N.,"But soft and sweet spake Regin: ""How likest thou the sword?"""
6639,R E G I N.,
6640,R E G I N.,"Then Sigurd laughed and answered: ""The work is proved by the deed;"
6641,R E G I N.,"See now if this be a traitor to fail me in my need."""
6642,R E G I N.,
6643,R E G I N.,"Then Regin trembled and shrank, so bright his eyes outshone"
6644,R E G I N.,"As he turned about to the anvil, and smote the sword thereon;"
6645,R E G I N.,"But the shards fell shivering earthward, and Sigurd's heart grew wroth"
6646,R E G I N.,"As the steel-flakes tinkled about him: ""Lo, there the right-hand's troth!"
6647,R E G I N.,"Lo, there the golden glitter, and the word that soon is spilt."""
6648,R E G I N.,"And down amongst the ashes he cast the glittering hilt,"
6649,R E G I N.,And turned his back on Regin and strode out through the door
6650,R E G I N.,And for many a day of spring-tide came back again no more.
6651,R E G I N.,But at last he came to the stithy and again took up the word:
6652,R E G I N.,"""What hast thou done, O Master, in the forging of the sword?"""
6653,R E G I N.,
6654,R E G I N.,"Then sweetly Regin answered: ""Hard task-master art thou,"
6655,R E G I N.,"But lo, a blade of battle that shall surely please thee now!"
6656,R E G I N.,Two moons are clean departed since thou lookedst toward the sky
6657,R E G I N.,And sawest the dim white circle amid the cloud-flecks lie;
6658,R E G I N.,And night and day have I laboured; and the cunning of old days
6659,R E G I N.,"Hath surely left my right-hand if this sword thou shalt not praise."""
6660,R E G I N.,
6661,R E G I N.,"And indeed the hilts gleamed glorious with many a dear-bought stone,"
6662,R E G I N.,And down the fallow edges the light of battle shone;
6663,R E G I N.,"Yet Sigurd's eyes shone brighter, nor yet might Regin face"
6664,R E G I N.,Those eyes of the heart of the Volsungs; but trembled in his place
6665,R E G I N.,"As Sigurd cried: ""O Regin, thy kin of the days of old"
6666,R E G I N.,"Were an evil and treacherous folk, and they lied and murdered for gold;"
6667,R E G I N.,"And now if thou wouldst bewray me, of the ancient curse beware,"
6668,R E G I N.,And set thy face as the flint the bale and the shame to bear:
6669,R E G I N.,"For he that would win to the heavens, and be as the Gods on high"
6670,R E G I N.,"Must tremble nought at the road, and the place where men-folk die."""
6671,R E G I N.,
6672,R E G I N.,"White leaps the blade in his hand and gleams in the gear of the wall,"
6673,R E G I N.,"And he smites, and the oft-smitten edges on the beaten anvil fall:"
6674,R E G I N.,"But the life of the sword departed, and dull and broken it lay"
6675,R E G I N.,"On the ashes and flaked-off iron, and no word did Sigurd say,"
6676,R E G I N.,But strode off through the door of the stithy and went to the Hall of
6677,R E G I N.,"Kings,"
6678,R E G I N.,And was merry and blithe that even mid all imaginings.
6679,R E G I N.,
6680,R E G I N.,But when the morrow was come he went to his mother and spake:
6681,R E G I N.,"""The shards, the shards of the sword, that thou gleanedst for my sake"
6682,R E G I N.,"In the night on the field of slaughter, in the tide when my father fell,"
6683,R E G I N.,Hast thou kept them through sorrow and joyance? hast thou warded them
6684,R E G I N.,trusty and well?
6685,R E G I N.,"Where hast thou laid them, my mother?"""
6686,R E G I N.,Then she looked upon him and said:
6687,R E G I N.,"""Art thou wroth, O Sigurd my son, that such eyes are in thine head?"
6688,R E G I N.,"And wilt thou be wroth with thy mother? do I withstand thee at all?"""
6689,R E G I N.,
6690,R E G I N.,"""Nay,"" said he, ""nought am I wrathful, but the days rise up like a wall"
6691,R E G I N.,"Betwixt my soul and the deeds, and I strive to rend them through."
6692,R E G I N.,And why wilt thou fear mine eyen? as the sword lies baleful and blue
6693,R E G I N.,"E'en 'twixt the lips of lovers, when they swear their troth thereon,"
6694,R E G I N.,"So keen are the eyes ye have fashioned, ye folk of the days agone;"
6695,R E G I N.,"For therein is the light of battle, though whiles it lieth asleep."
6696,R E G I N.,"Now give me the sword, my mother, that Sigmund gave thee to keep."""
6697,R E G I N.,
6698,R E G I N.,"She said: ""I shall give it thee gladly, for fain shall I be of thy praise"
6699,R E G I N.,"When thou knowest my careful keeping of that hope of the earlier days."""
6700,R E G I N.,
6701,R E G I N.,"So she took his hand in her hand, and they went their ways, they twain,"
6702,R E G I N.,"Till they came to the treasure of queen-folk, the guarded chamber of gain:"
6703,R E G I N.,"They were all alone with its riches, and she turned the key in the gold,"
6704,R E G I N.,"And lifted the sea-born purple, and the silken web unrolled,"
6705,R E G I N.,"And lo, 'twixt her hands and her bosom the shards of Sigmund's sword;"
6706,R E G I N.,"No rust-fleck stained its edges, and the gems of the ocean's hoard"
6707,R E G I N.,"Were as bright in the hilts and glorious, as when in the Volsungs' hall"
6708,R E G I N.,It shone in the eyes of the earl-folk and flashed from the shielded wall.
6709,R E G I N.,
6710,R E G I N.,"But Sigurd smiled upon it, and he said: ""O Mother of Kings,"
6711,R E G I N.,"Well hast thou warded the war-glaive for a mirror of many things,"
6712,R E G I N.,And a hope of much fulfilment: well hast thou given to me
6713,R E G I N.,"The message of my fathers, and the word of things to be:"
6714,R E G I N.,"Trusty hath been thy warding, but its hour is over now:"
6715,R E G I N.,"These shards shall be knit together, and shall hear the war-wind blow."
6716,R E G I N.,"They shall shine through the rain of Odin, as the sun come back to the"
6717,R E G I N.,"world,"
6718,R E G I N.,When the heaviest bolt of the thunder amidst the storm is hurled:
6719,R E G I N.,"They shall shake the thrones of Kings, and shear the walls of war,"
6720,R E G I N.,And undo the knot of treason when the world is darkening o'er.
6721,R E G I N.,"They have shone in the dusk and the night-tide, they shall shine in the"
6722,R E G I N.,dawn and the day;
6723,R E G I N.,"They have gathered the storm together, they shall chase the clouds away;"
6724,R E G I N.,"They have sheared red gold asunder, they shall gleam o'er the garnered"
6725,R E G I N.,gold;
6726,R E G I N.,"They have ended many a story, they shall fashion a tale to be told:"
6727,R E G I N.,They have lived in the wrack of the people; they shall live in the glory
6728,R E G I N.,of folk:
6729,R E G I N.,"They have stricken the Gods in battle, for the Gods shall they strike"
6730,R E G I N.,"the stroke."""
6731,R E G I N.,
6732,R E G I N.,"Then she felt his hands about her as he took the fateful sword,"
6733,R E G I N.,And he kissed her soft and sweetly; but she answered never a word:
6734,R E G I N.,"So great and fair was he waxen, so glorious was his face,"
6735,R E G I N.,"So young, as the deathless Gods are, that long in the golden place"
6736,R E G I N.,She stood when he was departed: as some for-travailed one
6737,R E G I N.,"Comes over the dark fell-ridges on the birth-tide of the sun,"
6738,R E G I N.,And his gathering sleep falls from him mid the glory and the blaze;
6739,R E G I N.,"And he sees the world grow merry and looks on the lightened ways,"
6740,R E G I N.,While the ruddy streaks are melting in the day-flood broad and white;
6741,R E G I N.,"Then the morn-dusk he forgetteth, and the moon-lit waste of night,"
6742,R E G I N.,And the hall whence he departed with its yellow candles' flare:
6743,R E G I N.,So stood the Isle-king's daughter in that treasure-chamber fair.
6744,R E G I N.,
6745,R E G I N.,*     *     *     *     *
6746,R E G I N.,
6747,R E G I N.,"But swift on his ways went Sigurd, and to Regin's house he came,"
6748,R E G I N.,"Where the Master stood in the doorway and behind him leapt the flame,"
6749,R E G I N.,"And dark he looked and little: no more his speech was sweet,"
6750,R E G I N.,"No words on his lip were gathered the Volsung child to greet,"
6751,R E G I N.,Till he took the sword from Sigurd and the shards of the days of old;
6752,R E G I N.,Then he spake:
6753,R E G I N.,"""Will nothing serve thee save this blue steel and cold,"
6754,R E G I N.,"The bane of thy father's father, the fate of all his kin,"
6755,R E G I N.,"The baleful blade I fashioned, the Wrath that the Gods would win?"""
6756,R E G I N.,
6757,R E G I N.,*     *     *     *     *
6758,R E G I N.,
6759,R E G I N.,"Then answered the eye-bright Sigurd: ""If thou thy craft wilt do"
6760,R E G I N.,Nought save these battle-gleanings shall be my helper true:
6761,R E G I N.,"And what if thou begrudgest, and my battle-blade be dull,"
6762,R E G I N.,Yet the hand of the Norns is lifted and the cup is over-full.
6763,R E G I N.,"Repentst thou ne'er so sorely that thy kin must lie alow,"
6764,R E G I N.,"How much soe'er thou longest the world to overthrow,"
6765,R E G I N.,"And, doubting the gold and the wisdom, wouldst even now appease"
6766,R E G I N.,"Blind hate and eyeless murder, and win the world with these;"
6767,R E G I N.,O'er-late is the time for repenting the word thy lips have said:
6768,R E G I N.,Thou shalt have the Gold and the wisdom and take its curse on thine head.
6769,R E G I N.,"I say that thy lips have spoken, and no more with thee it lies"
6770,R E G I N.,To do the deed or leave it: since thou hast shown mine eyes
6771,R E G I N.,"The world that was aforetime, I see the world to be;"
6772,R E G I N.,"And woe to the tangling thicket, or the wall that hindereth me!"
6773,R E G I N.,And short is the space I will tarry; for how if the Worm should die
6774,R E G I N.,Ere the first of my strokes be stricken? Wilt thou get to thy mastery
6775,R E G I N.,And knit these shards together that once in the Branstock stood?
6776,R E G I N.,"But if not and a smith's hands fail me, a king's hand yet shall be good;"
6777,R E G I N.,And the Norns have doomed thy brother. And yet I deem this sword
6778,R E G I N.,"Is the slayer of the Serpent, and the scatterer of the Hoard."""
6779,R E G I N.,
6780,R E G I N.,"Great waxed the gloom of Regin, and he said: ""Thou sayest sooth"
6781,R E G I N.,For none may turn him backward: the sword of a very youth
6782,R E G I N.,"Shall one day end my cunning, as the Gods my joyance slew,"
6783,R E G I N.,"When nought thereof they were deeming, and another thing would do."
6784,R E G I N.,"But this sword shall slay the Serpent; and do another deed,"
6785,R E G I N.,And many an one thereafter till it fail thee in thy need.
6786,R E G I N.,"But as fair and great as thou standest, yet get thee from mine house,"
6787,R E G I N.,"For in me too might ariseth, and the place is perilous"
6788,R E G I N.,"With the craft that was aforetime, and shall never be again,"
6789,R E G I N.,When the hands that have taught thee cunning have failed from the world
6790,R E G I N.,of men.
6791,R E G I N.,Thou art wroth; but thy wrath must slumber till fate its blossom bear;
6792,R E G I N.,Not thus were the eyes of Odin when I held him in the snare.
6793,R E G I N.,"Depart! lest the end overtake us ere thy work and mine be done,"
6794,R E G I N.,"But come again in the night-tide and the slumber of the sun,"
6795,R E G I N.,"When the sharded moon of April hangs round in the undark May."""
6796,R E G I N.,
6797,R E G I N.,Hither and thither a while did the heart of Sigurd sway
6798,R E G I N.,"For he feared no craft of the Dwarf-kind, nor heeded the ways of Fate,"
6799,R E G I N.,But his hand wrought e'en as his heart would: and now was he weary with
6800,R E G I N.,hate
6801,R E G I N.,"Of the hatred and scorn of the Gods, and the greed of gold and of gain,"
6802,R E G I N.,And the weaponless hands of the stripling of the wrath and the rending
6803,R E G I N.,"were fain,"
6804,R E G I N.,"But there stood Regin the Master, and his eyes were on Sigurd's eyes,"
6805,R E G I N.,"Though nought belike they beheld him, and his brow was sad and wise;"
6806,R E G I N.,And the greed died out of his visage and he stood like an image of old.
6807,R E G I N.,
6808,R E G I N.,"So the Norns drew Sigurd away, and the tide was an even of gold,"
6809,R E G I N.,And sweet in the April even were the fowl-kind singing their best;
6810,R E G I N.,"And the light of life smote Sigurd, and the joy that knows no rest,"
6811,R E G I N.,"And the fond unnamed desire, and the hope of hidden things;"
6812,R E G I N.,And he wended fair and lovely to the house of the feasting Kings.
6813,R E G I N.,
6814,R E G I N.,"But now when the moon was at full and the undark May begun,"
6815,R E G I N.,"Went Sigurd unto Regin mid the slumber of the sun,"
6816,R E G I N.,And amidst the fire-hall's pavement the King of the Dwarf-kind stood
6817,R E G I N.,Like an image of deeds departed and days that once were good;
6818,R E G I N.,"And he seemed but faint and weary, and his eyes were dim and dazed"
6819,R E G I N.,As they met the glory of Sigurd where the fitful candles blazed.
6820,R E G I N.,Then he spake:
6821,R E G I N.,"""Hail, Son of the Volsungs, the corner-stone is laid,"
6822,R E G I N.,"I have toiled and thou hast desired, and, lo, the fateful blade!"""
6823,R E G I N.,
6824,R E G I N.,Then Sigurd saw it lying on the ashes slaked and pale
6825,R E G I N.,Like the sun and the lightning mingled mid the even's cloudy bale;
6826,R E G I N.,"For ruddy and great were the hilts, and the edges fine and wan,"
6827,R E G I N.,And all adown to the blood-point a very flame there ran
6828,R E G I N.,That swallowed the runes of wisdom wherewith its sides were scored.
6829,R E G I N.,"No sound did Sigurd utter as he stooped adown for his sword,"
6830,R E G I N.,But it seemed as his lips were moving with speech of strong desire.
6831,R E G I N.,"White leapt the blade o'er his head, and he stood in the ring of its fire"
6832,R E G I N.,"As hither and thither it played, till it fell on the anvil's strength,"
6833,R E G I N.,"And he cried aloud in his glory, and held out the sword full length,"
6834,R E G I N.,"As one who would show it the world; for the edges were dulled no whit,"
6835,R E G I N.,And the anvil was cleft to the pavement with the dreadful dint of it.
6836,R E G I N.,
6837,R E G I N.,"But Regin cried to his harp-strings: ""Before the days of men"
6838,R E G I N.,"I smithied the Wrath of Sigurd, and now is it smithied again:"
6839,R E G I N.,"And my hand alone hath done it, and my heart alone hath dared"
6840,R E G I N.,"To bid that man to the mountain, and behold his glory bared."
6841,R E G I N.,"Ah, if the son of Sigmund might wot of the thing I would,"
6842,R E G I N.,"Then how were the ages bettered, and the world all waxen good!"
6843,R E G I N.,"Then how were the past forgotten and the weary days of yore,"
6844,R E G I N.,And the hope of man that dieth and the waste that never bore!
6845,R E G I N.,How should this one live through the winter and know of all increase!
6846,R E G I N.,How should that one spring to the sunlight and bear the blossom of peace!
6847,R E G I N.,No more should the long-lived wisdom o'er the waste of the wilderness
6848,R E G I N.,stray;
6849,R E G I N.,Nor the clear-eyed hero hasten to the deedless ending of day.
6850,R E G I N.,"And what if the hearts of the Volsungs for this deed of deeds were born,"
6851,R E G I N.,"How then were their life-days evil and the end of their lives forlorn?"""
6852,R E G I N.,
6853,R E G I N.,"There stood Sigurd the Volsung, and heard how the harp-strings rang,"
6854,R E G I N.,But of other things they told him than the hope that the Master sang;
6855,R E G I N.,And his world lay far away from the Dwarf-king's eyeless realm
6856,R E G I N.,"And the road that leadeth nowhere, and the ship without a helm:"
6857,R E G I N.,"But he spake: ""How oft shall I say it, that I shall work thy will?"
6858,R E G I N.,"If my father hath made me mighty, thine heart shall I fulfill"
6859,R E G I N.,"With the wisdom and gold thou wouldest, before I wend on my ways;"
6860,R E G I N.,"For now hast thou failed me nought, and the sword is the wonder of days."""
6861,R E G I N.,
6862,R E G I N.,No word for a while spake Regin; but he hung his head adown
6863,R E G I N.,"As a man that pondereth sorely, and his voice once more was grown"
6864,R E G I N.,"As the voice of the smithying-master as he spake: ""This Wrath of thine"
6865,R E G I N.,Hath cleft the hard and the heavy; it shall shear the soft and the fine:
6866,R E G I N.,"Come forth to the night and prove it."""
6867,R E G I N.,"So they twain went forth abroad,"
6868,R E G I N.,"And the moon lay white on the river and lit the sleepless ford,"
6869,R E G I N.,"And down to its pools they wended, and the stream was swift and full;"
6870,R E G I N.,"Then Regin cast against it a lock of fine-spun wool,"
6871,R E G I N.,"And it whirled about on the eddy till it met the edges bared,"
6872,R E G I N.,And as clean as the careless water the laboured fleece was sheared.
6873,R E G I N.,
6874,R E G I N.,"Then Regin spake: ""It is good, what the smithying-carle hath wrought:"
6875,R E G I N.,"Now the work of the King beginneth, and the end that my soul hath sought."
6876,R E G I N.,"Thou shalt toil and I shall desire, and the deed shall be surely done:"
6877,R E G I N.,"For thy Wrath is alive and awake and the story of bale is begun."""
6878,R E G I N.,
6879,R E G I N.,Therewith was the Wrath of Sigurd laid soft in a golden sheath
6880,R E G I N.,And the peace-strings knit around it; for that blade was fain of death;
6881,R E G I N.,"And 'tis ill to show such edges to the broad blue light of day,"
6882,R E G I N.,"Or to let the hall-glare light them, if ye list not play the play."
6883,R E G I N.,
6884,R E G I N.,
6885,R E G I N.,_Of Gripir's Foretelling._
6886,R E G I N.,
6887,R E G I N.,"Now Sigurd backeth Greyfell on the first of the morrow morn,"
6888,R E G I N.,And he rideth fair and softly through the acres of the corn;
6889,R E G I N.,"The Wrath to his side is girded, but hid are the edges blue,"
6890,R E G I N.,"As he wendeth his ways to the mountains, and rideth the horse-mead"
6891,R E G I N.,through.
6892,R E G I N.,"His wide grey eyes are happy, and his voice is sweet and soft,"
6893,R E G I N.,As amid the mead-lark's singing he casteth song aloft:
6894,R E G I N.,"Lo, lo, the horse and the rider! So once maybe it was,"
6895,R E G I N.,When over the Earth unpeopled the youngest God would pass;
6896,R E G I N.,"But never again meseemeth shall such a sight betide,"
6897,R E G I N.,Till over a world unwrongful new-born shall Baldur ride.
6898,R E G I N.,
6899,R E G I N.,"So he comes to that ness of the mountains, and Gripir's garden steep,"
6900,R E G I N.,"That bravely Greyfell breasteth, and adown by the door doth he leap"
6901,R E G I N.,And his war-gear rattleth upon him; there is none to ask or forbid
6902,R E G I N.,"As he wendeth the house clear-lighted, where no mote of the dust is hid,"
6903,R E G I N.,"Though the sunlight hath not entered: the walls are clear and bright,"
6904,R E G I N.,For they cast back each to other the golden Sigurd's light;
6905,R E G I N.,"Through the echoing ways of the house bright-eyed he wendeth along,"
6906,R E G I N.,"And the mountain-wind is with him, and the hovering eagles' song;"
6907,R E G I N.,"But no sound of the children of men may the ears of the Volsung hear,"
6908,R E G I N.,"And no sign of their ways in the world, or their will, or their hope"
6909,R E G I N.,or their fear.
6910,R E G I N.,
6911,R E G I N.,"So he comes to the hall of Gripir, and gleaming-green is it built"
6912,R E G I N.,As the house of under-ocean where the wealth of the greedy is spilt;
6913,R E G I N.,"Gleaming and green as the sea, and rich as its rock-strewn floor,"
6914,R E G I N.,And fresh as the autumn morning when the burning of summer is o'er.
6915,R E G I N.,"There he looks and beholdeth the high-seat, and he sees it strangely"
6916,R E G I N.,"wrought,"
6917,R E G I N.,Of the tooth of the sea-beast fashioned ere the Dwarf-kind came to
6918,R E G I N.,nought;
6919,R E G I N.,"And he looks, and thereon is Gripir, the King exceeding old,"
6920,R E G I N.,"With the sword of his fathers girded, and his raiment wrought of gold;"
6921,R E G I N.,"With the ivory rod in his right-hand, with his left on the crystal laid,"
6922,R E G I N.,"That is round as the world of men-folk, and after its image made,"
6923,R E G I N.,And clear is it wrought to the eyen that may read therein of Fate
6924,R E G I N.,"Though little indeed be its sea, and its earth not wondrous great."
6925,R E G I N.,
6926,R E G I N.,"There Sigurd stands in the hall, on the sheathed Wrath doth he lean,"
6927,R E G I N.,All his golden light is mirrored in the gleaming floor and green;
6928,R E G I N.,"But the smile in his face upriseth as he looks on the ancient King,"
6929,R E G I N.,"And their glad eyes meet and their laughter, and sweet is the welcoming:"
6930,R E G I N.,"And Gripir saith: ""Hail Sigurd! for my bidding hast thou done,"
6931,R E G I N.,"And here in the mountain-dwelling are two Kings of men alone."""
6932,R E G I N.,
6933,R E G I N.,"But Sigurd spake: ""Hail father! I am girt with the fateful sword"
6934,R E G I N.,"And my face is set to the highway, and I come for thy latest word."""
6935,R E G I N.,
6936,R E G I N.,"Said Gripir: ""What wouldst thou hearken ere we sit and drink the wine?"""
6937,R E G I N.,
6938,R E G I N.,"""Thy word and the Norns',"" said Sigurd, ""but never a word of mine."""
6939,R E G I N.,
6940,R E G I N.,"""What sights wouldst thou see,"" said Gripir, ""ere mine hand shall take"
6941,R E G I N.,"thine hand?"""
6942,R E G I N.,
6943,R E G I N.,"""As the Gods would I see,"" said Sigurd, ""though Death light up the land."""
6944,R E G I N.,
6945,R E G I N.,"""What hope wouldst thou hope, O Sigurd, ere we kiss, we twain, and"
6946,R E G I N.,"depart?"""
6947,R E G I N.,
6948,R E G I N.,"""Thy hope and the Gods',"" said Sigurd, ""though the grief lie hard on"
6949,R E G I N.,"my heart."""
6950,R E G I N.,
6951,R E G I N.,"Nought answered the ancient wise-one, and not a whit had he stirred"
6952,R E G I N.,Since the clash of Sigurd's raiment in his mountain-hall he heard;
6953,R E G I N.,But the ball that imaged the earth was set in his hand grown old;
6954,R E G I N.,"And belike it was to his vision, as the wide-world's ocean rolled,"
6955,R E G I N.,"And the forests waved with the wind, and the corn was gay with the lark,"
6956,R E G I N.,"And the gold in its nether places grew up in the dusk and the dark,"
6957,R E G I N.,"And its children built and departed, and its King-folk conquered and went,"
6958,R E G I N.,As over the crystal image his all-wise face was bent:
6959,R E G I N.,"For all his desire was dead, and he lived as a God shall live,"
6960,R E G I N.,"Who the prayers of the world hath forgotten, and to whom no hand may give."
6961,R E G I N.,
6962,R E G I N.,"But there stood the mighty Volsung, and leaned on the hidden Wrath;"
6963,R E G I N.,As the earliest sun's uprising o'er the sea-plain draws a path
6964,R E G I N.,"Whereby men sail to the Eastward and the dawn of another day,"
6965,R E G I N.,So the image of King Sigurd on the gleaming pavement lay.
6966,R E G I N.,
6967,R E G I N.,"Then great in the hall fair-pillared the voice of Gripir arose,"
6968,R E G I N.,"And it ran through the glimmering house-ways, and forth to the sunny"
6969,R E G I N.,close;
6970,R E G I N.,There mid the birds' rejoicing went the voice of an o'er-wise King
6971,R E G I N.,Like a wind of midmost winter come back to talk with spring.
6972,R E G I N.,
6973,R E G I N.,"But the voice cried: ""Sigurd, Sigurd! O great, O early born!"
6974,R E G I N.,O hope of the Kings first fashioned! O blossom of the morn!
6975,R E G I N.,"Short day and long remembrance, fair summer of the North!"
6976,R E G I N.,One day shall the worn world wonder how first thou wentest forth!

6982,R E G I N.,"""There the child in the noon-tide smiteth; the young King rendeth apart,"
6983,R E G I N.,"The old guile by the guile encompassed, the heart made wise by the heart."

6985,R E G I N.,"""Bind the red rings, O Sigurd; bind up to cast abroad!"
6986,R E G I N.,That the earth may laugh before thee rejoiced by the Waters' Hoard.
6987,R E G I N.,
6988,R E G I N.,"""Ride on, O Sigurd, Sigurd! for God's word goes forth on the wind,"
6989,R E G I N.,And he speaketh not twice over; nor shall they loose that bind:

7023,R E G I N.,The last of the deeds of Sigurd; the worst of the Cloudy Kin--
7024,R E G I N.,The slayer slain by the slain within the door and without.
7025,R E G I N.,--O dawn as the eve of the birth-day! O dark world cumbered with doubt!
7026,R E G I N.,
7027,R E G I N.,"""Shall it never be day any more, nor the sun's uprising and growth?"
7028,R E G I N.,Shall the kings of earth lie sleeping and the war-dukes wander in sloth

7049,R E G I N.,
7050,R E G I N.,"So died the voice of Gripir from amidst the sunny close,"

7052,R E G I N.,"But the hall was silent a little, for still stood Sigmund's son,"
7053,R E G I N.,"And he heard the words and remembered, and knew them one by one."
7054,R E G I N.,Then he turned on the ancient Gripir with eyes that knew no guile
7055,R E G I N.,And smiled on the wise of King-folk as the first of men might smile
7056,R E G I N.,On the God that hath fashioned him happy; and he spake:

7061,R E G I N.,E'en so do I hearken thy words: for I wot how they deem it long
7062,R E G I N.,Till a man from their seed be arisen to deal with the cumber and wrong.
7063,R E G I N.,"Bid me therefore to sit by thy side, for behold I wend on my way,"
7064,R E G I N.,"And the gates swing to behind me, and each day of mine is a day"
7065,R E G I N.,"With deeds in the eve and the morning, nor deeds shall the noontide lack;"
7066,R E G I N.,"To the right and the left none calleth, and no voice crieth aback."""
7067,R E G I N.,
7068,R E G I N.,"""Come, kin of the Gods,"" said Gripir, ""come up and sit by my side"
7069,R E G I N.,"That we twain may be glad as the fearless, and they that have nothing"
7070,R E G I N.,to hide:
7071,R E G I N.,"I have wrought out my will and abide it, and I sit ungrieved and alone,"
7072,R E G I N.,I look upon men and I help not; to me are the deeds long done
7073,R E G I N.,As those of to-day and to-morrow: for these and for those am I glad;
7074,R E G I N.,"But the Gods and men are the framers, and the days of my life I have had."""
7075,R E G I N.,
7076,R E G I N.,"Then Sigurd came unto Gripir, and he kissed the wise-one's face,"
7077,R E G I N.,"And they sat in the high-seat together, the child and the elder of days;"
7078,R E G I N.,"And they drank of the wine of King-folk, and were joyful each of each,"
7079,R E G I N.,And spake for a while of matters that are meet for King-folk's speech;
7080,R E G I N.,The deeds of men that have been and Kin of the Kings of the earth;
7081,R E G I N.,"And Gripir told of the outlands, and the mid-world's billowy girth,"
7082,R E G I N.,"And tales of the upper heaven were mingled with his talk,"
7083,R E G I N.,And the halls where the Sea-Queen's kindred o'er the gem-strewn pavement
7084,R E G I N.,"walk,"
7085,R E G I N.,"And the innermost parts of the earth, where they lie, the green and the"
7086,R E G I N.,"blue,"
7087,R E G I N.,And the red and the glittering gem-stones that of old the Dwarf-kind knew.
7088,R E G I N.,
7089,R E G I N.,"Long Sigurd sat and marvelled at the mouth that might not lie,"
7090,R E G I N.,"And the eyes no God had blinded, and the lone heart raised on high,"
7091,R E G I N.,"Then he rose from the gleaming high-seat, and the rings of battle rang"
7092,R E G I N.,"And the sheathèd Wrath was hearkening and a song of war it sang,"
7093,R E G I N.,But Sigurd spake unto Gripir:
7094,R E G I N.,"""Long and lovely are thy days,"
7095,R E G I N.,"And thy years fulfilled of wisdom, and thy feet on the unhid ways,"
7096,R E G I N.,And the guileless heart of the great that knoweth not anger nor pain:
7097,R E G I N.,So once hath a man been fashioned and shall not be again.
7098,R E G I N.,"But for me hath been foaled the war-horse, the grey steed swift as the"
7099,R E G I N.,"cloud,"
7100,R E G I N.,"And for me were the edges smithied, and the Wrath cries out aloud;"
7101,R E G I N.,"And a voice hath called from the darkness, and I ride to the Glittering"
7102,R E G I N.,Heath;
7103,R E G I N.,"To smite on the door of Destruction, and waken the warder of Death."""
7104,R E G I N.,
7105,R E G I N.,"So they kissed, the wise and the wise, and the child from the elder"
7106,R E G I N.,turned;
7107,R E G I N.,And again in the glimmering house-ways the golden Sigurd burned;
7108,R E G I N.,"He stood outside in the sunlight, and tarried never a deal,"
7109,R E G I N.,"But leapt on the cloudy Greyfell with the clank of gold and steel,"
7110,R E G I N.,"And he rode through the sinking day to the walls of the kingly stead,"
7111,R E G I N.,"And came to Regin's dwelling when the wind was fallen dead,"
7112,R E G I N.,"And the great sun just departing: then blood-red grew the west,"
7113,R E G I N.,"And the fowl flew home from the sea-mead, and all things sank to rest."
7114,R E G I N.,
7115,R E G I N.,
7116,R E G I N.,_Sigurd rideth to the Glittering Heath._
7117,R E G I N.,
7118,R E G I N.,"Again on the morrow morning doth Sigurd the Volsung ride,"
7119,R E G I N.,"And Regin, the Master of Masters, is faring by his side,"
7120,R E G I N.,"And they leave the dwelling of kings and ride the summer land,"
7121,R E G I N.,Until at the eve of the day the hills are on either hand:
7122,R E G I N.,"Then they wend up higher and higher, and over the heaths they fare"
7123,R E G I N.,"Till the moon shines broad on the midnight, and they sleep 'neath the"
7124,R E G I N.,heavens bare;
7125,R E G I N.,"And they waken and look behind them, and lo, the dawning of day"
7126,R E G I N.,And the little land of the Helper and its valley far away;
7127,R E G I N.,"But the mountains rise before them, a wall exceeding great."
7128,R E G I N.,
7129,R E G I N.,"Then spake the Master of Masters: ""We have come to the garth and the gate:"
7130,R E G I N.,"There is youth and rest behind thee and many a thing to do,"
7131,R E G I N.,"There is many a fond desire, and each day born anew;"
7132,R E G I N.,"And the land of the Volsungs to conquer, and many a people's praise:"
7133,R E G I N.,"And for me there is rest it maybe, and the peaceful end of days."
7134,R E G I N.,"We have come to the garth and the gate; to the hall-door now shall we win,"
7135,R E G I N.,"Shall we go to look on the high-seat and see what sitteth therein?"""
7136,R E G I N.,
7137,R E G I N.,"""Yea and what else?"" said Sigurd, ""was thy tale but mockeries"
7138,R E G I N.,"And have I been drifted hither on a wind of empty lies?"""
7139,R E G I N.,
7140,R E G I N.,"""It was sooth, it was sooth,"" said Regin, ""and more might I have told"

7142,R E G I N.,
7143,R E G I N.,"And he hung down his head as he spake it, and was silent a little space;"
7144,R E G I N.,And when it was lifted again there was fear in the Dwarf-king's face.
7145,R E G I N.,"And he said: ""Thou knowest my thought, and wise-hearted art thou grown:"

7148,R E G I N.,"Yet whiles I dream I have wrought thee, a beam of the morning bright,"
7149,R E G I N.,"A fatherless motherless glory, to work out my desire;"
7150,R E G I N.,"Then high my hope ariseth, and my heart is all afire"
7151,R E G I N.,"For the world I behold from afar, and the day that yet shall be;"
7152,R E G I N.,Then I wake and all things I remember and a youth of the Kings I see--
7153,R E G I N.,"--The child of the Wood-abider, the seed of a conquered King,"
7154,R E G I N.,"The sword that the Gods have fashioned, the fate that men shall sing:--"
7155,R E G I N.,"Ah might the world run backward to the days of the Dwarfs of old,"

7157,R E G I N.,
7158,R E G I N.,"Nought answered the Son of Sigmund; nay he heard him nought at all,"
7159,R E G I N.,Save as though the wind were speaking in the bights of the mountain-hall:
7160,R E G I N.,"But he leapt aback of Greyfell, and the glorious sun rose up,"
7161,R E G I N.,"And the heavens glowed above him like the bowl of Baldur's cup,"
7162,R E G I N.,"And a golden man was he waxen; as the heart of the sun he seemed,"
7163,R E G I N.,While over the feet of the mountains like blood the new light streamed;
7164,R E G I N.,Then Sigurd cried to Greyfell and swift for the pass he rode
7165,R E G I N.,And Regin followed after as a man bowed down by a load.
7166,R E G I N.,
7167,R E G I N.,"Day-long they fared through the mountains, and that highway's fashioner"
7168,R E G I N.,"Forsooth was a fearful craftsman, and his hands the waters were,"
7169,R E G I N.,"And the heaped-up ice was his mattock, and the fire-blast was his man,"
7170,R E G I N.,"And never a whit he heeded though his walls were waste and wan,"
7171,R E G I N.,And the guest-halls of that wayside great heaps of the ashes spent.
7172,R E G I N.,"But, each as a man alone, through the sun-bright day they went,"
7173,R E G I N.,"And they rode till the moon rose upward, and the stars were small and"
7174,R E G I N.,"fair,"
7175,R E G I N.,Then they slept on the long-slaked ashes beneath the heavens bare;
7176,R E G I N.,"And the cold dawn came and they wakened, and the King of the Dwarf-kind"
7177,R E G I N.,seemed
7178,R E G I N.,As a thing of that wan land fashioned; but Sigurd glowed and gleamed
7179,R E G I N.,"Amid the shadowless twilight by Greyfell's cloudy flank,"
7180,R E G I N.,As a little space they abided while the latest star-world shrank;
7181,R E G I N.,On the backward road looked Regin and heard how Sigurd drew
7182,R E G I N.,"The girths of Greyfell's saddle, and the voice of his sword he knew"
7183,R E G I N.,"And he feared to look on the Volsung, as thus he fell to speak:"
7184,R E G I N.,
7185,R E G I N.,"""I have seen the Dwarf-folk mighty, I have seen the God-folk weak;"

7187,R E G I N.,"When men desire and conquer, most sweet is their life to live;"
7188,R E G I N.,"When men are young and lovely there is many a thing to do,"
7189,R E G I N.,"And sweet is their fond desire and the dawn that springs anew."""
7190,R E G I N.,
7191,R E G I N.,"""This gift,"" said the Son of Sigmund, ""the Norns shall give me yet,"
7192,R E G I N.,"And no blossom slain by the sunshine while the leaves with dew are wet."""
7193,R E G I N.,
7194,R E G I N.,"Then Regin turned and beheld him: ""Thou shalt deem it hard and strange,"
7195,R E G I N.,"When the hand hath encompassed it all, and yet thy life must change."
7196,R E G I N.,"Ah, long were the lives of men-folk, if betwixt the Gods and them"
7197,R E G I N.,Were mighty warders watching mid the earth's and the heaven's hem!
7198,R E G I N.,"Is there any man so mighty he would cast this gift away,--"
7199,R E G I N.,"The heart's desire accomplished, and life so long a day,"
7200,R E G I N.,"That the dawn should be forgotten ere the even was begun?"""
7201,R E G I N.,
7202,R E G I N.,"Then Sigurd laughed and answered: ""Fare forth, O glorious sun;"
7203,R E G I N.,"Bright end from bright beginning, and the mid-way good to tell,"
7204,R E G I N.,"And death, and deeds accomplished, and all remembered well!"
7205,R E G I N.,"Shall the day go past and leave us, and we be left with night,"
7206,R E G I N.,"To tread the endless circle, and strive in vain to smite?"
7207,R E G I N.,But thou--wilt thou still look backward? thou sayst I know thy thought:
7208,R E G I N.,"Thou hast whetted the sword for the slaying, it shall turn aside for"
7209,R E G I N.,nought.
7210,R E G I N.,"Fear not! with the Gold and the wisdom thou shalt deem thee God alone,"
7211,R E G I N.,"And mayst do and undo at pleasure, nor be bound by right nor wrong:"
7212,R E G I N.,"And then, if no God I be waxen, I shall be the weak with the strong."""
7213,R E G I N.,
7214,R E G I N.,And his war-gear clanged and tinkled as he leapt to the saddle-stead:
7215,R E G I N.,And the sun rose up at their backs and the grey world changed to red.
7216,R E G I N.,"And away to the west went Sigurd by the glory wreathed about,"
7217,R E G I N.,But little and black was Regin as a fire that dieth out.
7218,R E G I N.,"Day-long they rode the mountains by the crags exceeding old,"
7219,R E G I N.,And the ash that the first of the Dwarf-kind found dull and quenched
7220,R E G I N.,and cold.
7221,R E G I N.,"Then the moon in the mid-sky swam, and the stars were fair and pale,"
7222,R E G I N.,And beneath the naked heaven they slept in an ash-grey dale;
7223,R E G I N.,"And again at the dawn-dusk's ending they stood upon their feet,"
7224,R E G I N.,And Sigurd donned his war-gear nor his eyes would Regin meet.
7225,R E G I N.,
7226,R E G I N.,A clear streak widened in heaven low down above the earth;
7227,R E G I N.,"And above it lay the cloud-flecks, and the sun, anigh its birth,"
7228,R E G I N.,"Unseen, their hosts was staining with the very hue of blood,"
7229,R E G I N.,And ruddy by Greyfell's shoulder the Son of Sigmund stood.
7230,R E G I N.,
7231,R E G I N.,"Then spake the Master of Masters: ""What is thine hope this morn"
7232,R E G I N.,"That thou dightest thee, O Sigurd, to ride this world forlorn?"""
7233,R E G I N.,
7234,R E G I N.,"""What needeth hope,"" said Sigurd, ""when the heart of the Volsungs turns"
7235,R E G I N.,"To the light of the Glittering Heath, and the house where the Waster"
7236,R E G I N.,burns?
7237,R E G I N.,"I shall slay the Foe of the Gods, as thou badst me a while agone,"
7238,R E G I N.,"And then with the Gold and its wisdom shalt thou be left alone."""
7239,R E G I N.,
7240,R E G I N.,"""O Child,"" said the King of the Dwarf-kind, ""when the day at last"
7241,R E G I N.,comes round
7242,R E G I N.,"For the dread and the Dusk of the Gods, and the kin of the Wolf is"

7244,R E G I N.,"When thy sword shall hew the fire, and the wildfire beateth thy shield,"

7246,R E G I N.,
7247,R E G I N.,"""O Foe of the Gods,"" said Sigurd, ""wouldst thou hide the evil thing,"
7248,R E G I N.,"And the curse that is greater than thou, lest death end thy labouring,"
7249,R E G I N.,Lest the night should come upon thee amidst thy toil for nought?
7250,R E G I N.,"It is me, it is me that thou fearest, if indeed I know thy thought;"
7251,R E G I N.,"Yea me, who would utterly light the face of all good and ill,"
7252,R E G I N.,"If not with the fruitful beams that the summer shall fulfill,"
7253,R E G I N.,"Then at least with the world a-blazing, and the glare of the grinded"
7254,R E G I N.,"sword."""
7255,R E G I N.,
7256,R E G I N.,"And he sprang aloft to the saddle as he spake the latest word,"
7257,R E G I N.,"And the Wrath sang loud in the sheath as it ne'er had sung before,"
7258,R E G I N.,"And the cloudy flecks were scattered like flames on the heaven's floor,"
7259,R E G I N.,"And all was kindled at once, and that trench of the mountains grey"
7260,R E G I N.,Was filled with the living light as the low sun lit the way:
7261,R E G I N.,"But Regin turned from the glory with blinded eyes and dazed,"
7262,R E G I N.,"And lo, on the cloudy war-steed how another light there blazed,"
7263,R E G I N.,And a great voice came from amidst it:
7264,R E G I N.,"""O Regin, in good sooth,"
7265,R E G I N.,I have hearkened not nor heeded the words of thy fear and thy ruth:
7266,R E G I N.,"Thou hast told thy tale and thy longing, and thereto I hearkened well:--"
7267,R E G I N.,"Let it lead thee up to heaven, let it lead thee down to hell,"
7268,R E G I N.,"The deed shall be done to-morrow: thou shalt have that measureless Gold,"
7269,R E G I N.,"And devour the garnered wisdom that blessed thy realm of old,"
7270,R E G I N.,That hath lain unspent and begrudged in the very heart of hate:
7271,R E G I N.,With the blood and the might of thy brother thine hunger shalt thou sate;
7272,R E G I N.,And this deed shall be mine and thine; but take heed for what followeth
7273,R E G I N.,then!
7274,R E G I N.,Let each do after his kind! I shall do the deeds of men;
7275,R E G I N.,"I shall harvest the field of their sowing, in the bed of their strewing"
7276,R E G I N.,shall sleep;
7277,R E G I N.,"To them shall I give my life-days, to the Gods my glory to keep."
7278,R E G I N.,But thou with the wealth and the wisdom that the best of the Gods might
7279,R E G I N.,"praise,"
7280,R E G I N.,"If thou shalt indeed excel them and become the hope of the days,"
7281,R E G I N.,"Then me in turn hast thou conquered, and I shall be in turn"
7282,R E G I N.,"Thy fashioned brand of the battle through good and evil to burn,"
7283,R E G I N.,"Or the flame that sleeps in thy stithy for the gathered winds to blow,"
7284,R E G I N.,When thou listest to do and undo and thine uttermost cunning to show.
7285,R E G I N.,But indeed I wot full surely that thou shalt follow thy kind;
7286,R E G I N.,"And for all that cometh after, the Norns shall loose and bind."""
7287,R E G I N.,
7288,R E G I N.,"Then his bridle-reins rang sweetly, and the warding-walls of death,"
7289,R E G I N.,"And Regin drew up to him, and the Wrath sang loud in the sheath,"
7290,R E G I N.,And forth from that trench in the mountains by the westward way they ride;
7291,R E G I N.,And little and black goes Regin by the golden Volsung's side;
7292,R E G I N.,"But no more his head is drooping, for he seeth the Elf-king's Gold;"
7293,R E G I N.,The garnered might and the wisdom e'en now his eyes behold.
7294,R E G I N.,
7295,R E G I N.,"So up and up they journeyed, and ever as they went"
7296,R E G I N.,"About the cold-slaked forges, o'er many a cloud-swept bent,"
7297,R E G I N.,"Betwixt the walls of blackness, by shores of the fishless meres,"
7298,R E G I N.,"And the fathomless desert waters, did Regin cast his fears,"
7299,R E G I N.,And wrap him in desire; and all alone he seemed
7300,R E G I N.,"As a God to his heirship wending, and forgotten and undreamed"
7301,R E G I N.,"Was all the tale of Sigurd, and the folk he had toiled among,"
7302,R E G I N.,"And the Volsungs, Odin's children, and the men-folk fair and young."
7303,R E G I N.,
7304,R E G I N.,*     *     *     *     *
7305,R E G I N.,
7306,R E G I N.,"So on they ride to the westward, and huge were the mountains grown"
7307,R E G I N.,And the floor of heaven was mingled with that tossing world of stone:
7308,R E G I N.,"And they rode till the noon was forgotten and the sun was waxen low,"
7309,R E G I N.,"And they tarried not, though he perished, and the world grew dark below."
7310,R E G I N.,"Then they rode a mighty desert, a glimmering place and wide,"
7311,R E G I N.,And into a narrow pass high-walled on either side
7312,R E G I N.,"By the blackness of the mountains, and barred aback and in face"
7313,R E G I N.,By the empty night of the shadow; a windless silent place:
7314,R E G I N.,"But the white moon shone o'erhead mid the small sharp stars and pale,"
7315,R E G I N.,And each as a man alone they rode on the highway of bale.
7316,R E G I N.,
7317,R E G I N.,*     *     *     *     *
7318,R E G I N.,
7319,R E G I N.,"So ever they wended upward, and the midnight hour was o'er,"
7320,R E G I N.,"And the stars grew pale and paler, and failed from the heaven's floor,"
7321,R E G I N.,"And the moon was a long while dead, but there was the promise of day,"
7322,R E G I N.,"No change came over the darkness, no streak of the dawning grey;"
7323,R E G I N.,No sound of the wind's uprising adown the night there ran:
7324,R E G I N.,It was blind as the Gaping Gulf ere the first of the worlds began.
7325,R E G I N.,
7326,R E G I N.,"Then athwart and athwart rode Sigurd and sought the walls of the pass,"
7327,R E G I N.,But found no wall before him; and the road rang hard as brass
7328,R E G I N.,"Beneath the hoofs of Greyfell, as up and up he trod:"
7329,R E G I N.,"--Was it the daylight of Hell, or the night of the doorways of God?"
7330,R E G I N.,
7331,R E G I N.,"But lo, at the last a glimmer, and a light from the west there came,"
7332,R E G I N.,"And another and another, like points of far-off flame;"
7333,R E G I N.,And they grew and brightened and gathered; and whiles together they ran
7334,R E G I N.,"Like the moonwake over the waters; and whiles they were scant and wan,"
7335,R E G I N.,"Some greater and some lesser, like the boats of fishers laid"
7336,R E G I N.,"About the sea of midnight; and a dusky dawn they made,"
7337,R E G I N.,"A faint and glimmering twilight: So Sigurd strains his eyes,"
7338,R E G I N.,And he sees how a land deserted all round about him lies
7339,R E G I N.,"More changeless than mid-ocean, as fruitless as its floor:"
7340,R E G I N.,"Then the heart leaps up within him, for he knows that his journey is o'er,"
7341,R E G I N.,And there he draweth bridle on the first of the Glittering Heath:
7342,R E G I N.,And the Wrath is waxen merry and sings in the golden sheath
7343,R E G I N.,"As he leaps adown from Greyfell, and stands upon his feet,"
7344,R E G I N.,And wends his ways through the twilight the Foe of the Gods to meet.
7345,R E G I N.,
7346,R E G I N.,
7347,R E G I N.,_Sigurd slayeth Fafnir the Serpent_.
7348,R E G I N.,
7349,R E G I N.,"Nought Sigurd seeth of Regin, and nought he heeds of him,"
7350,R E G I N.,"As in watchful might and glory he strides the desert dim,"
7351,R E G I N.,And behind him paceth Greyfell; but he deems the time o'erlong
7352,R E G I N.,"Till he meet the great gold-warden, the over-lord of wrong."
7353,R E G I N.,
7354,R E G I N.,"So he wendeth midst the silence through the measureless desert place,"
7355,R E G I N.,"And beholds the countless glitter with wise and steadfast face,"
7356,R E G I N.,"Till him-seems in a little season that the flames grow somewhat wan,"
7357,R E G I N.,"And a grey thing glimmers before him, and becomes a mighty man,"
7358,R E G I N.,"One-eyed and ancient-seeming, in cloud-grey raiment clad;"
7359,R E G I N.,"A friendly man and glorious, and of visage smiling-glad:"
7360,R E G I N.,"Then content in Sigurd groweth because of his majesty,"
7361,R E G I N.,And he heareth him speak in the desert as the wind of the winter sea:
7362,R E G I N.,
7363,R E G I N.,"""Hail Sigurd! Give me thy greeting ere thy ways alone thou wend!"""
7364,R E G I N.,
7365,R E G I N.,"Said Sigurd: ""Hail! I greet thee, my friend and my fathers' friend."""

7376,R E G I N.,
7377,R E G I N.,"""What wise wilt thou smite,"" said the elder, ""lest the dark devour thy"

7379,R E G I N.,
7380,R E G I N.,"""Thou hast praised the sword,"" said the child, ""and the sword shall find"
7381,R E G I N.,"a way."""
7382,R E G I N.,
7383,R E G I N.,"""Be learned of me,"" said the Wise-one, ""for I was the first of thy folk."""
7384,R E G I N.,
7385,R E G I N.,"Said the child: ""I shall do thy bidding, and for thee shall I strike the"

7387,R E G I N.,
7388,R E G I N.,"Spake the Wise-one: ""Thus shalt thou do when thou wendest hence alone:"
7389,R E G I N.,"Thou shalt find a path in the desert, and a road in the world of stone;"
7390,R E G I N.,"It is smooth and deep and hollow, but the rain hath riven it not,"
7391,R E G I N.,"And the wild wind hath not worn it, for it is but Fafnir's slot,"
7392,R E G I N.,"Whereby he wends to the water and the fathomless pool of old,"
7393,R E G I N.,"When his heart in the dawn is weary, and he loathes the Ancient Gold:"
7394,R E G I N.,"There think of the great and the fathers, and bare the whetted Wrath,"
7395,R E G I N.,"And dig a pit in the highway, and a grave in the Serpent's path:"
7396,R E G I N.,"Lie thou therein, O Sigurd, and thine hope from the glooming hide,"
7397,R E G I N.,"And be as the dead for a season, and the living light abide!"
7398,R E G I N.,"And so shall thine heart avail thee, and thy mighty fateful hand,"
7399,R E G I N.,"And the Light that lay in the Branstock, the well belovèd brand."""
7400,R E G I N.,
7401,R E G I N.,"Said the child: ""I shall do thy bidding, and for thee shall I strike the"

7403,R E G I N.,"For I love thee, friend of my fathers, Wise Heart of the holy folk."""
7404,R E G I N.,
7405,R E G I N.,"So spake the Son of Sigmund, and beheld no man anear,"
7406,R E G I N.,"And again was the night the midnight, and the twinkling flames shone clear"
7407,R E G I N.,In the hush of the Glittering Heath; and alone went Sigmund's son
7408,R E G I N.,"Till he came to the road of Fafnir, and the highway worn by one,"
7409,R E G I N.,"By the drift of the rain unfurrowed, by the windy years unrent,"
7410,R E G I N.,"And forth from the dark it came, and into the dark it went."
7411,R E G I N.,
7412,R E G I N.,"Great then was the heart of Sigurd, for there in the midmost he stayed,"
7413,R E G I N.,"And thought of the ancient fathers, and bared the bright blue blade,"
7414,R E G I N.,"That shone as a fleck of the day-light, and the night was all around."
7415,R E G I N.,Fair then was the Son of Sigmund as he toiled and laboured the ground;
7416,R E G I N.,"Great, mighty he was in his working, and the Glittering Heath he clave,"
7417,R E G I N.,And the sword shone blue before him as he dug the pit and the grave:
7418,R E G I N.,"There he hid his hope from the night-tide and lay like one of the dead,"
7419,R E G I N.,And wise and wary he bided; and the heavens hung over his head.
7420,R E G I N.,
7421,R E G I N.,"Now the night wanes over Sigurd, and the ruddy rings he sees,"
7422,R E G I N.,"And his war-gear's fair adornment, and the God-folk's images;"
7423,R E G I N.,"But a voice in the desert ariseth, a sound in the waste has birth,"
7424,R E G I N.,"A changing tinkle and clatter, as of gold dragged over the earth:"
7425,R E G I N.,"O'er Sigurd widens the day-light, and the sound is drawing close,"
7426,R E G I N.,And speedier than the trample of speedy feet it goes;
7427,R E G I N.,"But ever deemeth Sigurd that the sun brings back the day,"
7428,R E G I N.,For the grave grows lighter and lighter and heaven o'erhead is grey.
7429,R E G I N.,
7430,R E G I N.,"But now, how the rattling waxeth till he may not heed nor hark!"
7431,R E G I N.,"And the day and the heavens are hidden, and o'er Sigurd rolls the dark,"
7432,R E G I N.,"As the flood of a pitchy river, and heavy-thick is the air"
7433,R E G I N.,"With the venom of hate long hoarded, and lies once fashioned fair:"
7434,R E G I N.,"Then a wan face comes from the darkness, and is wrought in manlike wise,"
7435,R E G I N.,And the lips are writhed with laughter and bleared are the blinded eyes;
7436,R E G I N.,"And it wandereth hither and thither, and searcheth through the grave"
7437,R E G I N.,"And departeth, leaving nothing, save the dark, rolled wave on wave"
7438,R E G I N.,"O'er the golden head of Sigurd and the edges of the sword,"
7439,R E G I N.,"And the world weighs heavy on Sigurd, and the weary curse of the Hoard:"
7440,R E G I N.,"Him-seemed the grave grew straiter, and his hope of life grew chill,"
7441,R E G I N.,"And his heart by the Worm was enfolded, and the bonds of the Ancient Ill."
7442,R E G I N.,
7443,R E G I N.,"Then was Sigurd stirred by his glory, and he strove with the swaddling"
7444,R E G I N.,of Death;
7445,R E G I N.,"He turned in the pit on the highway, and the grave of the Glittering"
7446,R E G I N.,Heath;
7447,R E G I N.,"He laughed and smote with the laughter and thrust up over his head,"
7448,R E G I N.,"And smote the venom asunder, and clave the heart of Dread;"
7449,R E G I N.,"Then he leapt from the pit and the grave, and the rushing river of blood,"
7450,R E G I N.,And fulfilled with the joy of the War-God on the face of earth he stood
7451,R E G I N.,"With red sword high uplifted, with wrathful glittering eyes;"
7452,R E G I N.,"And he laughed at the heavens above him for he saw the sun arise,"
7453,R E G I N.,"And Sigurd gleamed on the desert, and shone in the new-born light,"
7454,R E G I N.,"And the wind in his raiment wavered, and all the world was bright."
7455,R E G I N.,
7456,R E G I N.,"But there was the ancient Fafnir, and the Face of Terror lay"

7612,R E G I N.,
7613,R E G I N.,"Bright Sigurd towered above him, and the Wrath cried out in the sheath,"

7619,R E G I N.,Then he crept to the ash-grey coils where the life of his brother had

7633,R E G I N.,"Ash-grey was his visage waxen, and with open eyes he stared"
7634,R E G I N.,"On the height of heaven above him, and a fearful thing he seemed,"
7635,R E G I N.,"As his soul went wide in the world, and of rule and kingship he dreamed."
7636,R E G I N.,
7637,R E G I N.,"But Sigurd took the Heart, and wood on the waste he found,"
7638,R E G I N.,"The wood that grew and died, as it crept on the niggard ground,"
7639,R E G I N.,"And grew and died again, and lay like whitened bones;"
7640,R E G I N.,"And the ernes cried over his head, as he builded his hearth of stones,"
7641,R E G I N.,"And kindled the fire for cooking, and sat and sang o'er the roast"
7642,R E G I N.,"The song of his fathers of old, and the Wolflings' gathering host:"
7643,R E G I N.,"So there on the Glittering Heath rose up the little flame,"
7644,R E G I N.,"And the dry sticks crackled amidst it, and alow the eagles came,"
7645,R E G I N.,"And seven they were by tale, and they pitched all round about"
7646,R E G I N.,"The cooking-fire of Sigurd, and sent their song-speech out:"
7647,R E G I N.,"But nought he knoweth its wisdom, or the word that they would speak:"
7648,R E G I N.,And hot grew the Heart of Fafnir and sang amid the reek.
7649,R E G I N.,
7650,R E G I N.,"Then Sigurd looketh on Regin, and he deemeth it overlong"

7653,R E G I N.,So he reacheth his hand to the roast to see if the cooking be o'er;
7654,R E G I N.,"But the blood and the fat seethed from it and scalded his finger sore,"
7655,R E G I N.,"And he set his hand to his mouth to quench the fleshly smart,"
7656,R E G I N.,And he tasted the flesh of the Serpent and the blood of Fafnir's Heart:
7657,R E G I N.,"Then there came a change upon him, for the speech of fowl he knew,"
7658,R E G I N.,And wise in the ways of the beast-kind as the Dwarfs of old he grew;
7659,R E G I N.,"And he knitted his brows and hearkened, and wrath in his heart arose;"
7660,R E G I N.,For he felt beset of evil in a world of many foes.
7661,R E G I N.,"But the hilt of the Wrath he handled, and Regin's heart he saw,"
7662,R E G I N.,And how that the Foe of the Gods the net of death would draw;
7663,R E G I N.,"And his bright eyes flashed and sparkled, and his mouth grew set and"

7665,R E G I N.,"As he hearkened the voice of the eagles, and their song began to learn."
7666,R E G I N.,

7698,R E G I N.,"And his dream hath forgotten Sigurd, and the King's life lies in the pit;"

7700,R E G I N.,
7701,R E G I N.,"But lo, how the eyes of Sigurd the heart of the guileful behold,"

7704,R E G I N.,"The summer hath shone on its blossoms, and Sigurd's Wrath is the fruit:"

7815,R E G I N.,"But longs for the dwellings of man-folk, and the kingly people's speech,"
7816,R E G I N.,"And the days of the glee and the joyance, where men laugh each to each."
7817,R E G I N.,"But still the desert endureth, and afar must Greyfell fare"
7818,R E G I N.,"From the wrack of the Glittering Heath, and Fafnir's golden lair."
7819,R E G I N.,"Long Sigurd rideth the waste, when, lo, on a morning of day"
7820,R E G I N.,"From out of the tangled crag-walls, amidst the cloud-land grey"
7821,R E G I N.,"Comes up a mighty mountain, and it is as though there burns"
7822,R E G I N.,"A torch amidst of its cloud-wreath; so thither Sigurd turns,"
7823,R E G I N.,For he deems indeed from its topmost to look on the best of the earth;
7824,R E G I N.,"And Greyfell neigheth beneath him, and his heart is full of mirth."
7825,R E G I N.,
7826,R E G I N.,"So he rideth higher and higher, and the light grows great and strange,"
7827,R E G I N.,"And forth from the clouds it flickers, till at noon they gather and"
7828,R E G I N.,"change,"
7829,R E G I N.,"And settle thick on the mountain, and hide its head from sight;"
7830,R E G I N.,"But the winds in a while are awakened, and day bettereth ere the night,"
7831,R E G I N.,"And, lifted a measureless mass o'er the desert crag-walls high,"
7832,R E G I N.,"Cloudless the mountain riseth against the sunset sky,"
7833,R E G I N.,"The sea of the sun grown golden, as it ebbs from the day's desire;"
7834,R E G I N.,"And the light that afar was a torch is grown a river of fire,"
7835,R E G I N.,"And the mountain is black above it, and below is it dark and dun;"
7836,R E G I N.,And there is the head of Hindfell as an island in the sun.
7837,R E G I N.,
7838,R E G I N.,"Night falls, but yet rides Sigurd, and hath no thought of rest,"
7839,R E G I N.,For he longs to climb that rock-world and behold the earth at its best;
7840,R E G I N.,"But now mid the maze of the foot-hills he seeth the light no more,"
7841,R E G I N.,And the stars are lovely and gleaming on the lightless heavenly floor.
7842,R E G I N.,So up and up he wendeth till the night is wearing thin;
7843,R E G I N.,"And he rideth a rift of the mountain, and all is dark therein,"
7844,R E G I N.,Till the stars are dimmed by dawning and the wakening world is cold;
7845,R E G I N.,"Then afar in the upper rock-wall a breach doth he behold,"
7846,R E G I N.,And a flood of light poured inward the doubtful dawning blinds:
7847,R E G I N.,"So swift he rideth thither and the mouth of the breach he finds,"
7848,R E G I N.,And sitteth awhile on Greyfell on the marvellous thing to gaze:
7849,R E G I N.,"For lo, the side of Hindfell enwrapped by the fervent blaze,"
7850,R E G I N.,"And nought 'twixt earth and heaven save a world of flickering flame,"
7851,R E G I N.,"And a hurrying shifting tangle, where the dark rents went and came."
7852,R E G I N.,
7853,R E G I N.,"Great groweth the heart of Sigurd with uttermost desire,"
7854,R E G I N.,"And he crieth kind to Greyfell, and they hasten up, and nigher,"
7855,R E G I N.,Till he draweth rein in the dawning on the face of Hindfell's steep:
7856,R E G I N.,But who shall heed the dawning where the tongues of that wildfire leap?
7857,R E G I N.,"For they weave a wavering wall, that driveth over the heaven"
7858,R E G I N.,The wind that is born within it; nor ever aside is it driven
7859,R E G I N.,"By the mightiest wind of the waste, and the rain-flood amidst it is"
7860,R E G I N.,nought;
7861,R E G I N.,And no wayfarer's door and no window the hand of its builder hath wrought.
7862,R E G I N.,"But thereon is the Volsung smiling as its breath uplifteth his hair,"
7863,R E G I N.,"And his eyes shine bright with its image, and his mail gleams white and"
7864,R E G I N.,"fair,"
7865,R E G I N.,And his war-helm pictures the heavens and the waning stars behind:
7866,R E G I N.,"But his neck is Greyfell stretching to snuff at the flame-wall blind,"
7867,R E G I N.,"And his cloudy flank upheaveth, and tinkleth the knitted mail,"
7868,R E G I N.,And the gold of the uttermost waters is waxen wan and pale.
7869,R E G I N.,
7870,R E G I N.,"Now Sigurd turns in his saddle, and the hilt of the Wrath he shifts,"
7871,R E G I N.,"And draws a girth the tighter; then the gathered reins he lifts,"
7872,R E G I N.,"And crieth aloud to Greyfell, and rides at the wildfire's heart;"
7873,R E G I N.,"But the white wall wavers before him and the flame-flood rusheth apart,"
7874,R E G I N.,"And high o'er his head it riseth, and wide and wild is its roar"
7875,R E G I N.,As it beareth the mighty tidings to the very heavenly floor:
7876,R E G I N.,"But he rideth through its roaring as the warrior rides the rye,"
7877,R E G I N.,When it bows with the wind of the summer and the hid spears draw anigh;
7878,R E G I N.,"The white flame licks his raiment and sweeps through Greyfell's mane,"
7879,R E G I N.,"And bathes both hands of Sigurd and the hilts of Fafnir's bane,"
7880,R E G I N.,"And winds about his war-helm and mingles with his hair,"
7881,R E G I N.,But nought his raiment dusketh or dims his glittering gear;
7882,R E G I N.,"Then it fails and fades and darkens till all seems left behind,"
7883,R E G I N.,And dawn and the blaze is swallowed in mid-mirk stark and blind.
7884,R E G I N.,
7885,R E G I N.,*     *     *     *     *
7886,R E G I N.,
7887,R E G I N.,But forth a little further and a little further on
7888,R E G I N.,"And all is calm about him, and he sees the scorched earth wan"
7889,R E G I N.,"Beneath a glimmering twilight, and he turns his conquering eyes,"
7890,R E G I N.,And a ring of pale slaked ashes on the side of Hindfell lies;
7891,R E G I N.,"And the world of the waste is beyond it; and all is hushed and grey,"
7892,R E G I N.,"And the new-risen moon is a-paleing, and the stars grow faint with day."
7893,R E G I N.,"Then Sigurd looked before him and a Shield-burg there he saw,"
7894,R E G I N.,"A wall of the tiles of Odin wrought clear without a flaw,"
7895,R E G I N.,"The gold by the silver gleaming, and the ruddy by the white;"
7896,R E G I N.,"And the blazonings of their glory were done upon them bright,"
7897,R E G I N.,As of dear things wrought for the war-lords new come to Odin's hall.
7898,R E G I N.,"Piled high aloft to the heavens uprose that battle-wall,"
7899,R E G I N.,And far o'er the topmost shield-rim for a banner of fame there hung
7900,R E G I N.,A glorious golden buckler; and against the staff it rung
7901,R E G I N.,As the earliest wind of dawning uprose on Hindfell's face
7902,R E G I N.,And the light from the yellowing east beamed soft on the shielded place.
7903,R E G I N.,
7904,R E G I N.,But the Wrath cried out in answer as Sigurd leapt adown
7905,R E G I N.,To the wasted soil of the desert by that rampart of renown;
7906,R E G I N.,"He looked but little beneath it, and the dwelling of God it seemed,"
7907,R E G I N.,As against its gleaming silence the eager Sigurd gleamed:
7908,R E G I N.,"He draweth not sword from scabbard, as the wall he wendeth around,"
7909,R E G I N.,And it is but the wind and Sigurd that wakeneth any sound:
7910,R E G I N.,"But, lo, to the gate he cometh, and the doors are open wide,"
7911,R E G I N.,"And no warder the way withstandeth, and no earls by the threshold abide;"
7912,R E G I N.,So he stands awhile and marvels; then the baleful light of the Wrath
7913,R E G I N.,Gleams bare in his ready hand as he wendeth the inward path:
7914,R E G I N.,"For he doubteth some guile of the Gods, or perchance some Dwarf-king's"
7915,R E G I N.,"snare,"
7916,R E G I N.,Or a mock of the Giant people that shall fade in the morning air:
7917,R E G I N.,"But he getteth him in and gazeth; and a wall doth he behold,"
7918,R E G I N.,"And the ruddy set by the white, and the silver by the gold;"
7919,R E G I N.,"But within the garth that it girdeth no work of man is set,"
7920,R E G I N.,But the utmost head of Hindfell ariseth higher yet;
7921,R E G I N.,"And below in the very midmost is a Giant-fashioned mound,"
7922,R E G I N.,Piled high as the rims of the Shield-burg above the level ground;
7923,R E G I N.,"And there, on that mound of the Giants, o'er the wilderness forlorn,"
7924,R E G I N.,"A pale grey image lieth, and gleameth in the morn."
7925,R E G I N.,
7926,R E G I N.,"So there was Sigurd alone; and he went from the shielded door,"
7927,R E G I N.,And aloft in the desert of wonder the Light of the Branstock he bore;
7928,R E G I N.,"And he set his face to the earth-mound, and beheld the image wan,"
7929,R E G I N.,"And the dawn was growing about it; and, lo, the shape of a man"
7930,R E G I N.,"Set forth to the eyeless desert on the tower-top of the world,"
7931,R E G I N.,High over the cloud-wrought castle whence the windy bolts are hurled.
7932,R E G I N.,
7933,R E G I N.,*     *     *     *     *
7934,R E G I N.,
7935,R E G I N.,"Now he comes to the mound and climbs it, and will see if the man be dead;"
7936,R E G I N.,"Some King of the days forgotten laid there with crownèd head,"
7937,R E G I N.,"Or the frame of a God, it may be, that in heaven hath changed his life,"
7938,R E G I N.,"Or some glorious heart belovèd, God-rapt from the earthly strife:"
7939,R E G I N.,"Now over the body he standeth, and seeth it shapen fair,"
7940,R E G I N.,"And clad from head to foot-sole in pale grey-glittering gear,"
7941,R E G I N.,In a hauberk wrought as straitly as though to the flesh it were grown:
7942,R E G I N.,But a great helm hideth the head and is girt with a glittering crown.
7943,R E G I N.,
7944,R E G I N.,"So thereby he stoopeth and kneeleth, for he deems it were good indeed"
7945,R E G I N.,If the breath of life abide there and the speech to help at need;
7946,R E G I N.,And as sweet as the summer wind from a garden under the sun
7947,R E G I N.,Cometh forth on the topmost Hindfell the breath of that sleeping-one.
7948,R E G I N.,"Then he saith he will look on the face, if it bear him love or hate,"
7949,R E G I N.,"Or the bonds for his life's constraining, or the sundering doom of fate."
7950,R E G I N.,"So he draweth the helm from the head, and, lo, the brow snow-white,"
7951,R E G I N.,"And the smooth unfurrowed cheeks, and the wise lips breathing light;"
7952,R E G I N.,"And the face of a woman it is, and the fairest that ever was born,"
7953,R E G I N.,Shown forth to the empty heavens and the desert world forlorn:
7954,R E G I N.,"But he looketh, and loveth her sore, and he longeth her spirit to move,"
7955,R E G I N.,"And awaken her heart to the world, that she may behold him and love."
7956,R E G I N.,"And he toucheth her breast and her hands, and he loveth her passing sore;"
7957,R E G I N.,"And he saith: ""Awake! I am Sigurd;"" but she moveth never the more."
7958,R E G I N.,
7959,R E G I N.,"Then he looked on his bare bright blade, and he said: ""Thou--what wilt"
7960,R E G I N.,thou do?
7961,R E G I N.,"For indeed as I came by the war-garth thy voice of desire I knew."""
7962,R E G I N.,"Bright burnt the pale blue edges for the sunrise drew anear,"
7963,R E G I N.,"And the rims of the Shield-burg glittered, and the east was exceeding"
7964,R E G I N.,clear:
7965,R E G I N.,So the eager edges he setteth to the Dwarf-wrought battle-coat
7966,R E G I N.,Where the hammered ring-knit collar constraineth the woman's throat;
7967,R E G I N.,"But the sharp Wrath biteth and rendeth, and before it fail the rings,"
7968,R E G I N.,"And, lo, the gleam of the linen, and the light of golden things:"
7969,R E G I N.,"Then he driveth the blue steel onward, and through the skirt, and out,"
7970,R E G I N.,Till nought but the rippling linen is wrapping her about;
7971,R E G I N.,"Then he deems her breath comes quicker and her breast begins to heave,"
7972,R E G I N.,"So he turns about the War-Flame and rends down either sleeve,"
7973,R E G I N.,"Till her arms lie white in her raiment, and a river of sun-bright hair"
7974,R E G I N.,Flows free o'er bosom and shoulder and floods the desert bare.
7975,R E G I N.,
7976,R E G I N.,"Then a flush cometh over her visage and a sigh upheaveth her breast,"
7977,R E G I N.,"And her eyelids quiver and open, and she wakeneth into rest;"
7978,R E G I N.,"Wide-eyed on the dawning she gazeth, too glad to change or smile,"
7979,R E G I N.,"And but little moveth her body, nor speaketh she yet for a while;"
7980,R E G I N.,"And yet kneels Sigurd moveless her wakening speech to heed,"
7981,R E G I N.,"While soft the waves of the daylight o'er the starless heavens speed,"
7982,R E G I N.,"And the gleaming rims of the Shield-burg yet bright and brighter grow,"
7983,R E G I N.,And the thin moon hangeth her horns dead-white in the golden glow.
7984,R E G I N.,"Then she turned and gazed on Sigurd, and her eyes met the Volsung's eyes."
7985,R E G I N.,"And mighty and measureless now did the tide of his love arise,"
7986,R E G I N.,"For their longing had met and mingled, and he knew of her heart that she"
7987,R E G I N.,"loved,"
7988,R E G I N.,As she spake unto nothing but him and her lips with the speech-flood
7989,R E G I N.,moved:
7990,R E G I N.,
7991,R E G I N.,"""O, what is the thing so mighty that my weary sleep hath torn,"
7992,R E G I N.,"And rent the fallow bondage, and the wan woe over-worn?"""
7993,R E G I N.,
7994,R E G I N.,"He said: ""The hand of Sigurd and the Sword of Sigmund's son,"
7995,R E G I N.,"And the heart that the Volsungs fashioned this deed for thee have done."""
7996,R E G I N.,
7997,R E G I N.,"But she said: ""Where then is Odin that laid me here alow?"
7998,R E G I N.,"Long lasteth the grief of the world, and man-folk's tangled woe!"""
7999,R E G I N.,
8000,R E G I N.,"""He dwelleth above,"" said Sigurd, ""but I on the earth abide,"
8001,R E G I N.,"And I came from the Glittering Heath the waves of thy fire to ride."""
8002,R E G I N.,
8003,R E G I N.,"But therewith the sun rose upward and lightened all the earth,"
8004,R E G I N.,And the light flashed up to the heavens from the rims of the glorious
8005,R E G I N.,girth;
8006,R E G I N.,"But they twain arose together, and with both her palms outspread,"
8007,R E G I N.,"And bathed in the light returning, she cried aloud and said:"
8008,R E G I N.,
8009,R E G I N.,"""All hail O Day and thy Sons, and thy kin of the coloured things!"
8010,R E G I N.,"Hail, following Night, and thy Daughter that leadeth thy wavering wings!"
8011,R E G I N.,"Look down with unangry eyes on us to-day alive,"
8012,R E G I N.,"And give us the hearts victorious, and the gain for which we strive!"
8013,R E G I N.,"All hail, ye Lords of God-home, and ye Queens of the House of Gold!"
8014,R E G I N.,"Hail thou dear Earth that bearest, and thou Wealth of field and fold!"
8015,R E G I N.,"Give us, your noble children, the glory of wisdom and speech,"
8016,R E G I N.,"And the hearts and the hands of healing, and the mouths and hands that"
8017,R E G I N.,"teach!"""
8018,R E G I N.,
8019,R E G I N.,Then they turned and were knit together; and oft and o'er again
8020,R E G I N.,"They craved, and kissed rejoicing, and their hearts were full and fain."
8021,R E G I N.,
8022,R E G I N.,"Then Sigurd looketh upon her, and the words from his heart arise:"
8023,R E G I N.,"""Thou art the fairest of earth, and the wisest of the wise;"
8024,R E G I N.,"O who art thou that lovest? I am Sigurd, e'en as I told;"
8025,R E G I N.,"I have slain the Foe of the Gods, and gotten the Ancient Gold;"
8026,R E G I N.,"And great were the gain of thy love, and the gift of mine earthly days,"
8027,R E G I N.,If we twain should never sunder as we wend on the changing ways.
8028,R E G I N.,"O who art thou that lovest, thou fairest of all things born?"
8029,R E G I N.,"And what meaneth thy sleep and thy slumber in the wilderness forlorn?"""
8030,R E G I N.,
8031,R E G I N.,"She said: ""I am she that loveth: I was born of the earthly folk,"
8032,R E G I N.,But of old Allfather took me from the Kings and their wedding yoke:
8033,R E G I N.,"And he called me the Victory-Wafter, and I went and came as he would,"
8034,R E G I N.,"And I chose the slain for his war-host, and the days were glorious and"
8035,R E G I N.,"good,"
8036,R E G I N.,"Till the thoughts of my heart overcame me, and the pride of my wisdom"
8037,R E G I N.,"and speech,"
8038,R E G I N.,And I scorned the earth-folk's Framer and the Lord of the world I must
8039,R E G I N.,teach:
8040,R E G I N.,"For the death-doomed I caught from the sword, and the fated life I slew,"
8041,R E G I N.,"And I deemed that my deeds were goodly, and that long I should do and"
8042,R E G I N.,undo.
8043,R E G I N.,But Allfather came against me and the God in his wrath arose;
8044,R E G I N.,And he cried: 'Thou hast thought in thy folly that the Gods have friends
8045,R E G I N.,"and foes,"
8046,R E G I N.,"That they wake, and the world wends onward, that they sleep, and the"
8047,R E G I N.,"world slips back,"
8048,R E G I N.,"That they laugh, and the world's weal waxeth, that they frown and"
8049,R E G I N.,fashion the wrack:
8050,R E G I N.,Thou hast cast up the curse against me; it shall fall aback on thine
8051,R E G I N.,head;
8052,R E G I N.,"Go back to the sons of repentance, with the children of sorrow wed!"
8053,R E G I N.,"For the Gods are great unholpen, and their grief is seldom seen,"
8054,R E G I N.,And the wrong that they will and must be is soon as it hath not been.'
8055,R E G I N.,
8056,R E G I N.,"""Yet I thought: 'Shall I wed in the world, shall I gather grief on the"
8057,R E G I N.,earth?
8058,R E G I N.,"Then the fearless heart shall I wed, and bring the best to birth,"
8059,R E G I N.,"And fashion such tales for the telling, that Earth shall be holpen at"
8060,R E G I N.,"least,"
8061,R E G I N.,"If the Gods think scorn of its fairness, as they sit at the changeless"
8062,R E G I N.,feast.'
8063,R E G I N.,
8064,R E G I N.,"""Then somewhat smiled Allfather; and he spake: 'So let it be!"
8065,R E G I N.,The doom thereof abideth; the doom of me and thee.
8066,R E G I N.,Yet long shall the time pass over ere thy waking-day be born:
8067,R E G I N.,"Fare forth, and forget and be weary 'neath the Sting of the Sleepful"
8068,R E G I N.,Thorn!'
8069,R E G I N.,
8070,R E G I N.,"""So I came to the head of Hindfell and the ruddy shields and white,"
8071,R E G I N.,And the wall of the wildfire wavering around the isle of night;
8072,R E G I N.,"And there the Sleep-thorn pierced me, and the slumber on me fell,"
8073,R E G I N.,And the night of nameless sorrows that hath no tale to tell.
8074,R E G I N.,Now I am she that loveth; and the day is nigh at hand
8075,R E G I N.,"When I, who have ridden the sea-realm and the regions of the land,"
8076,R E G I N.,"And dwelt in the measureless mountains and the forge of stormy days,"
8077,R E G I N.,Shall dwell in the house of my fathers and the land of the people's
8078,R E G I N.,praise;
8079,R E G I N.,"And there shall hand meet hand, and heart by heart shall beat,"
8080,R E G I N.,"And the lying-down shall be joyous, and the morn's uprising sweet."
8081,R E G I N.,"Lo now, I look on thine heart and behold of thine inmost will,"
8082,R E G I N.,That thou of the days wouldst hearken that our portion shall fulfill;
8083,R E G I N.,"But O, be wise of man-folk, and the hope of thine heart refrain!"
8084,R E G I N.,"As oft in the battle's beginning ye vex the steed with the rein,"
8085,R E G I N.,"Lest at last in its latter ending, when the sword hath hushed the horn,"
8086,R E G I N.,"His limbs should be weary and fail, and his might be over-worn."
8087,R E G I N.,"O be wise, lest thy love constrain me, and my vision wax o'er-clear,"
8088,R E G I N.,"And thou ask of the thing that thou shouldst not, and the thing that"
8089,R E G I N.,thou wouldst not hear.
8090,R E G I N.,
8091,R E G I N.,"""Know thou, most mighty of men, that the Norns shall order all,"
8092,R E G I N.,And yet without thine helping shall no whit of their will befall;
8093,R E G I N.,"Be wise! 'tis a marvel of words, and a mock for the fool and the blind;"
8094,R E G I N.,"But I saw it writ in the heavens, and its fashioning there did I find:"
8095,R E G I N.,"And the night of the Norns and their slumber, and the tide when the world"
8096,R E G I N.,"runs back,"
8097,R E G I N.,"And the way of the sun is tangled, it is wrought of the dastard's lack."
8098,R E G I N.,"But the day when the fair earth blossoms, and the sun is bright above,"
8099,R E G I N.,Of the daring deeds is it fashioned and the eager hearts of love.
8100,R E G I N.,
8101,R E G I N.,"""Be wise, and cherish thine hope in the freshness of the days,"
8102,R E G I N.,And scatter its seed from thine hand in the field of the people's praise;
8103,R E G I N.,"Then fair shall it fall in the furrow, and some the earth shall speed,"
8104,R E G I N.,And the sons of men shall marvel at the blossom of the deed:
8105,R E G I N.,"But some the earth shall speed not; nay rather, the wind of the heaven"
8106,R E G I N.,Shall waft it away from thy longing--and a gift to the Gods hast thou
8107,R E G I N.,"given,"
8108,R E G I N.,And a tree for the roof and the wall in the house of the hope that
8109,R E G I N.,"shall be,"

8111,R E G I N.,
8112,R E G I N.,"""Strive not with the fools of man-folk: for belike thou shalt overcome;"
8113,R E G I N.,And what then is the gain of thine hunting when thou bearest the quarry
8114,R E G I N.,home?
8115,R E G I N.,"Or else shall the fool overcome thee, and what deed thereof shall grow?"
8116,R E G I N.,"Nay, strive with the wise man rather, and increase thy woe and his woe;"
8117,R E G I N.,Yet thereof a gain hast thou gotten; and the half of thine heart hast
8118,R E G I N.,thou won
8119,R E G I N.,"If thou mayst prevail against him, and his deeds are the deeds thou hast"

8122,R E G I N.,"And thy deeds in his hand shall blossom, and his heart of thine heart"
8123,R E G I N.,shall be fain.
8124,R E G I N.,
8125,R E G I N.,"""When thou hearest the fool rejoicing, and he saith, 'It is over and past,"
8126,R E G I N.,"And the wrong was better than right, and hate turns into love at the last,"
8127,R E G I N.,"And we strove for nothing at all, and the Gods are fallen asleep;"
8128,R E G I N.,For so good is the world a growing that the evil good shall reap:'
8129,R E G I N.,"Then loosen thy sword in the scabbard and settle the helm on thine head,"
8130,R E G I N.,"For men betrayed are mighty, and great are the wrongfully dead."
8131,R E G I N.,
8132,R E G I N.,"""Wilt thou do the deed and repent it? thou hadst better never been born:"

8134,R E G I N.,"Thou shalt do the deed and abide it, and sit on thy throne on high,"
8135,R E G I N.,And look on to-day and to-morrow as those that never die.
8136,R E G I N.,
8137,R E G I N.,"""Love thou the Gods--and withstand them, lest thy fame should fail in"

8139,R E G I N.,"And thou be but their thrall and their bondsman, who wert born for their"

8141,R E G I N.,"For few things from the Gods are hidden, and the hearts of men they know,"
8142,R E G I N.,And how that none rejoiceth to quail and crouch alow.
8143,R E G I N.,
8144,R E G I N.,"""I have spoken the words, belovèd, to thy matchless glory and worth;"
8145,R E G I N.,"But thy heart to my heart hath been speaking, though my tongue hath set"

8150,R E G I N.,
8151,R E G I N.,"Then words were weary and silent, but oft and o'er again"
8152,R E G I N.,"They craved and kissed rejoicing, and their hearts were full and fain."
8153,R E G I N.,
8154,R E G I N.,"Then spake the Son of Sigmund: ""Fairest, and most of worth,"
8155,R E G I N.,Hast thou seen the ways of man-folk and the regions of the earth?
8156,R E G I N.,Then speak yet more of wisdom; for most meet meseems it is
8157,R E G I N.,"That my soul to thy soul be shapen, and that I should know thy bliss."""
8158,R E G I N.,
8159,R E G I N.,"So she took his right hand meekly, nor any word would say,"
8160,R E G I N.,"Not e'en of love or praising, his longing to delay;"
8161,R E G I N.,"And they sat on the side of Hindfell, and their fain eyes looked and"
8162,R E G I N.,"loved,"
8163,R E G I N.,As she told of the hidden matters whereby the world is moved:
8164,R E G I N.,"And she told of the framing of all things, and the houses of the heaven;"
8165,R E G I N.,"And she told of the star-worlds' courses, and how the winds be driven;"
8166,R E G I N.,"And she told of the Norns and their names, and the fate that abideth"
8167,R E G I N.,the earth;
8168,R E G I N.,And she told of the ways of King-folk in their anger and their mirth;
8169,R E G I N.,"And she spake of the love of women, and told of the flame that burns,"
8170,R E G I N.,"And the fall of mighty houses, and the friend that falters and turns,"
8171,R E G I N.,"And the lurking blinded vengeance, and the wrong that amendeth wrong,"
8172,R E G I N.,"And the hand that repenteth its stroke, and the grief that endureth for"
8173,R E G I N.,long;
8174,R E G I N.,"And how man shall bear and forbear, and be master of all that is;"
8175,R E G I N.,"And how man shall measure it all, the wrath, and the grief, and the bliss."
8176,R E G I N.,
8177,R E G I N.,"""I saw the body of Wisdom, and of shifting guise was she wrought,"
8178,R E G I N.,"And I stretched out my hands to hold her, and a mote of the dust they"
8179,R E G I N.,caught;
8180,R E G I N.,"And I prayed her to come for my teaching, and she came in the midnight"
8181,R E G I N.,dream--
8182,R E G I N.,"And I woke and might not remember, nor betwixt her tangle deem:"
8183,R E G I N.,"She spake, and how might I hearken; I heard, and how might I know;"
8184,R E G I N.,"I knew, and how might I fashion, or her hidden glory show?"
8185,R E G I N.,All things I have told thee of Wisdom are but fleeting images
8186,R E G I N.,"Of her hosts that abide in the Heavens, and her light that Allfather sees:"
8187,R E G I N.,"Yet wise is the sower that sows, and wise is the reaper that reaps,"
8188,R E G I N.,"And wise is the smith in his smiting, and wise is the warder that keeps:"
8189,R E G I N.,"And wise shalt thou be to deliver, and I shall be wise to desire;"
8190,R E G I N.,"--And lo, the tale that is told, and the sword and the wakening fire!"
8191,R E G I N.,"Lo now, I am she that loveth, and hark how Greyfell neighs,"
8192,R E G I N.,"And Fafnir's Bed is gleaming, and green go the downward ways."
8193,R E G I N.,The road to the children of men and the deeds that thou shalt do
8194,R E G I N.,"In the joy of thy life-days' morning, when thine hope is fashioned anew."
8195,R E G I N.,"Come now, O Bane of the Serpent, for now is the high-noon come,"
8196,R E G I N.,And the sun hangeth over Hindfell and looks on the earth-folk's home;
8197,R E G I N.,"But the soul is so great within thee, and so glorious are thine eyes,"
8198,R E G I N.,"And me so love constraineth, and mine heart that was called the wise,"
8199,R E G I N.,"That we twain may see men's dwellings and the house where we shall dwell,"
8200,R E G I N.,"And the place of our life's beginning, where the tale shall be to tell."""
8201,R E G I N.,
8202,R E G I N.,"So they climb the burg of Hindfell, and hand in hand they fare,"
8203,R E G I N.,"Till all about and above them is nought but the sunlit air,"
8204,R E G I N.,And there close they cling together rejoicing in their mirth;
8205,R E G I N.,"For far away beneath them lie the kingdoms of the earth,"
8206,R E G I N.,"And the garths of men-folk's dwellings and the streams that water them,"
8207,R E G I N.,"And the rich and plenteous acres, and the silver ocean's hem,"
8208,R E G I N.,"And the woodland wastes and the mountains, and all that holdeth all;"
8209,R E G I N.,"The house and the ship and the island, the loom and the mine and the"
8210,R E G I N.,"stall,"
8211,R E G I N.,"The beds of bane and healing, the crafts that slay and save,"
8212,R E G I N.,"The temple of God and the Doom-ring, the cradle and the grave."
8213,R E G I N.,
8214,R E G I N.,"Then spake the Victory-Wafter: ""O King of the Earthly Age,"
8215,R E G I N.,"As a God thou beholdest the treasure and the joy of thine heritage,"
8216,R E G I N.,And where on the wings of his hope is the spirit of Sigurd borne?
8217,R E G I N.,Yet I bid thee hover awhile as a lark alow on the corn;
8218,R E G I N.,Yet I bid thee look on the land 'twixt the wood and the silver sea
8219,R E G I N.,"In the bight of the swirling river, and the house that cherished me!"
8220,R E G I N.,There dwelleth mine earthly sister and the king that she hath wed;
8221,R E G I N.,There morn by morn aforetime I woke on the golden bed;
8222,R E G I N.,There eve by eve I tarried mid the speech and the lays of kings;
8223,R E G I N.,There noon by noon I wandered and plucked the blossoming things;
8224,R E G I N.,"The little land of Lymdale by the swirling river's side,"
8225,R E G I N.,Where Brynhild once was I called in the days ere my father died;
8226,R E G I N.,"The little land of Lymdale 'twixt the woodland and the sea,"
8227,R E G I N.,"Where on thee mine eyes shall brighten and thine eyes shall beam on me."""
8228,R E G I N.,
8229,R E G I N.,"""I shall seek thee there,"" said Sigurd, ""when the day-spring is begun,"
8230,R E G I N.,"Ere we wend the world together in the season of the sun."""
8231,R E G I N.,
8232,R E G I N.,"""I shall bide thee there,"" said Brynhild, ""till the fullness of the days,"
8233,R E G I N.,"And the time for the glory appointed, and the springing-tide of praise."""
8234,R E G I N.,
8235,R E G I N.,From his hand then draweth Sigurd Andvari's ancient Gold;
8236,R E G I N.,"There is nought but the sky above them as the ring together they hold,"
8237,R E G I N.,"The shapen ancient token, that hath no change nor end,"
8238,R E G I N.,"No change, and no beginning, no flaw for God to mend:"
8239,R E G I N.,"Then Sigurd cries: ""O Brynhild, now hearken while I swear,"
8240,R E G I N.,"That the sun shall die in the heavens and the day no more be fair,"
8241,R E G I N.,"If I seek not love in Lymdale and the house that fostered thee,"
8242,R E G I N.,"And the land where thou awakedst 'twixt the woodland and the sea!"""
8243,R E G I N.,
8244,R E G I N.,"And she cried: ""O Sigurd, Sigurd, now hearken while I swear"
8245,R E G I N.,"That the day shall die for ever and the sun to blackness wear,"
8246,R E G I N.,"Ere I forget thee, Sigurd, as I lie 'twixt wood and sea"
8247,R E G I N.,"In the little land of Lymdale and the house that fostered me!"""
8248,R E G I N.,
8249,R E G I N.,"Then he set the ring on her finger and once, if ne'er again,"
8250,R E G I N.,"They kissed and clung together, and their hearts were full and fain."
8251,R E G I N.,
8252,R E G I N.,"So the day grew old about them and the joy of their desire,"
8253,R E G I N.,"And eve and the sunset came, and faint grew the sunset fire,"
8254,R E G I N.,And the shadowless death of the day was sweet in the golden tide;
8255,R E G I N.,"But the stars shone forth on the world, and the twilight changed and"
8256,R E G I N.,died;
8257,R E G I N.,"And sure if the first of man-folk had been born to that starry night,"
8258,R E G I N.,"And had heard no tale of the sunrise, he had never longed for the light:"
8259,R E G I N.,"But Earth longed amidst her slumber, as 'neath the night she lay,"
8260,R E G I N.,And fresh and all abundant abode the deeds of Day.
