51,ADVERTISEMENT.,The Hill which gives title to the following Poem is situated in the
52,ADVERTISEMENT.,"western part of Dorsetshire. This choice of a subject, to which the"
53,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Author was led by his residence near the spot, may seem perhaps to"
54,ADVERTISEMENT.,confine him to topics of mere rural and local description. But he begs
55,ADVERTISEMENT.,leave here to inform the Reader that he has advanced beyond those narrow
56,ADVERTISEMENT.,limits to something more general and important. On the other hand he
57,ADVERTISEMENT.,"trusts, that in his farthest excursions the connexion between him and"
58,ADVERTISEMENT.,his subject will easily be traced. The few notes which are subjoined he
59,ADVERTISEMENT.,thought necessary to elucidate the passages to which they refer. He will
60,ADVERTISEMENT.,"only add in this place, from Hutchins’s History of Dorsetshire, (vol."
61,ADVERTISEMENT.,"i. p. 366), what is there said of Lewesdon (or, as it is now corruptly"
62,ADVERTISEMENT.,"called, Lewson): “This and Pillesdon Hill surmount all the hills, though"
63,ADVERTISEMENT.,"very high, between them and the sea. Mariners call them the _Cow and"
64,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Calf_, in which forms they are fancied to appear, being eminent sea-marks"
65,ADVERTISEMENT.,to those who sail upon the coast.”

67,ADVERTISEMENT.,To the top of this Hill the Author describes himself as walking on a May
68,ADVERTISEMENT.,morning.

433,LEWESDON HILL.,Nor passing by the noisy haunts of men;
434,LEWESDON HILL.,"But through sequester’d meads, a little space,"
435,LEWESDON HILL.,"Winds secretly, and in its wanton path"
436,LEWESDON HILL.,"May cheer some drooping flower, or minister"
437,LEWESDON HILL.,Of its cool water to the thirsty lamb:

453,LEWESDON HILL.,"Wisely, to prove that what must be must be,"
454,LEWESDON HILL.,And show how thoughts are jogg’d out of the brain
455,LEWESDON HILL.,By a mechanical impulse; pushing on
456,LEWESDON HILL.,"The minds of us, poor unaccountables,"
457,LEWESDON HILL.,"To fatal resolution. Know they not,"
458,LEWESDON HILL.,"That in this mortal life, whate’er it be,"
459,LEWESDON HILL.,"We take the path that leads to good or evil,"
460,LEWESDON HILL.,And therein find our bliss or misery?
461,LEWESDON HILL.,And this includes all reasonable ends
462,LEWESDON HILL.,Of knowledge or of being; farther to go
463,LEWESDON HILL.,"Is toil unprofitable, and th’ effect"

467,LEWESDON HILL.,And the divine stability of Heaven
468,LEWESDON HILL.,(That assured seat for good men after death)
469,LEWESDON HILL.,"Is but a transient cloud, display’d so fair"
470,LEWESDON HILL.,"To cherish virtuous hope, but at our need"

502,LEWESDON HILL.,"From Portland eastward to the Promontory[4],"
503,LEWESDON HILL.,Where still St. Alban’s high built chapel stands.
504,LEWESDON HILL.,"But art nor strength avail her—on she drives,"
505,LEWESDON HILL.,In storm and darkness to the fatal coast:
506,LEWESDON HILL.,And there ’mong rocks and high-o’erhanging cliffs
507,LEWESDON HILL.,"Dash’d piteously, with all her precious freight"
508,LEWESDON HILL.,"Was lost, by Neptune’s wild and foamy jaws"
509,LEWESDON HILL.,Swallow’d up quick! The richliest-laden ship

522,LEWESDON HILL.,"That in their different courses as they pass,"

529,LEWESDON HILL.,"Nor less delightful this—if, while he mounts"
530,LEWESDON HILL.,"Not wearied, the free Journeyer will pause"

534,LEWESDON HILL.,By soft gradations of ascent to lead
535,LEWESDON HILL.,"The labouring and way-worn feet along,"
536,LEWESDON HILL.,"And make their toil less toilsome. Half way up,"
537,LEWESDON HILL.,"Or nearer to the top, behold a cot,"
538,LEWESDON HILL.,"O’er which the branchy trees, those sycamores,"
539,LEWESDON HILL.,Wave gently: at their roots a rustic bench
540,LEWESDON HILL.,"Invites to short refreshment, and to taste"

549,LEWESDON HILL.,"Measured by painful steps. And blest are they,"

579,LEWESDON HILL.,"A rank of castles in the rough sea sunk,"

593,LEWESDON HILL.,On each side flank’d with citadels and towers

665,LEWESDON HILL.,"No chronicle of all thy warlike pride,"

683,LEWESDON HILL.,
684,LEWESDON HILL.,Sure ’tis all false what poets fondly tell

704,LEWESDON HILL.,(Dian first rising after change was not

706,LEWESDON HILL.,And grew to guilty fulness: then farewell

709,LEWESDON HILL.,"Worse follow’d, loss of shame, and wilful wreck"
710,LEWESDON HILL.,"Of what was left her yet of good, or fair,"
711,LEWESDON HILL.,Or decent: now her meek and gentle voice

714,LEWESDON HILL.,"Grew fix’d, and parley’d wantonly with those"

716,LEWESDON HILL.,"Erewhile the light of her fond father’s house,"
717,LEWESDON HILL.,Became a grievous darkness: but his heart
718,LEWESDON HILL.,Endured not long; all in despair he went
719,LEWESDON HILL.,"Into the chambers of the grave, to seek"
720,LEWESDON HILL.,A comfortless repose from sorrow and shame.
721,LEWESDON HILL.,What then befell this daughter desolate?
722,LEWESDON HILL.,"For He, the partner of her earliest fault,"
723,LEWESDON HILL.,"Had left her, false perhaps, or in dislike"

726,LEWESDON HILL.,"The too sad penance—hopeless penury,"
727,LEWESDON HILL.,"Loathsome disease unpitied, and thereto"
728,LEWESDON HILL.,The brand of all-avoided infamy
729,LEWESDON HILL.,"Set on her, like the fearful token o’er"

769,LEWESDON HILL.,Which the strain’d vision tires itself to find.
770,LEWESDON HILL.,
771,LEWESDON HILL.,And even so fares it with the things of earth
772,LEWESDON HILL.,Which seem most constant: there will come the cloud
773,LEWESDON HILL.,"That shall infold them up, and leave their place"
774,LEWESDON HILL.,A seat for Emptiness. Our narrow ken
775,LEWESDON HILL.,"Reaches too far, when all that we behold"

783,LEWESDON HILL.,The multitudinous strokes incessantly
784,LEWESDON HILL.,"Bruise all beneath their cope, and mark on all"
785,LEWESDON HILL.,His secret injury; on the front of man
786,LEWESDON HILL.,Gray hairs and wrinkles; still as Time speeds on
787,LEWESDON HILL.,Hard and more hard his iron pennons beat
788,LEWESDON HILL.,"With ceaseless violence; nor overpass,"
789,LEWESDON HILL.,Till all the creatures of this nether world
790,LEWESDON HILL.,"Are one wide quarry: following dark behind,"

929,NOTES.,"particulars, from which an idea may be formed of the greatness of the"
930,NOTES.,scheme.
931,NOTES.,
932,NOTES.,"In the open sea, above a league from the town, and within half a mile"
933,NOTES.,"west of a rock called _L’isle Pelée_, a pier is begun, with design of"
934,NOTES.,"conducting it on to the shore somewhat beyond _Point Hommet_, about"
935,NOTES.,"two miles westward of Cherburgh. In order to this, a strong frame of"
936,NOTES.,"timber-work, of the shape of a truncated cone, having been constructed on"
937,NOTES.,"the beach, was buoyed out, and sunk in a depth of water; which at lowest"
938,NOTES.,"ebb is 35 feet, and where the tide rises near 20 feet. The diameter of"
939,NOTES.,"this cone at bottom is about 60 yards, its height 70 feet; and the area"
940,NOTES.,"on its top large enough to receive a battery of cannon, with which it is"
941,NOTES.,hereafter to be fortified. Its solid contents are 2500 French toises;
942,NOTES.,"which, in our measure (allowing the French foot to be to the English as"
943,NOTES.,"144 to 135), will amount to 24,250 cubic yards nearly. Several other"
944,NOTES.,"cones, of equal dimensions, are sunk at convenient distances from each"
945,NOTES.,"other, forming the line of the pier: their number, when complete, it"
946,NOTES.,"is said, will be forty. As soon as any one of these is carried to its"
947,NOTES.,"place, it is filled with stones, which are dug from mount _Rouille_ and"
948,NOTES.,"other rocks near the coast, and brought on horses to the shore: whence"
949,NOTES.,"they are conveyed to the cones in vessels of forty, sixty, or eighty"
950,NOTES.,"tons burden. In like manner, but with much greater labour and expense,"
951,NOTES.,the spaces between the cones are filled up with stones thrown loosely
952,NOTES.,"into the sea, till the heap is raised above the water. On this mass, as"
953,NOTES.,"on a foundation, a wall of masonry-work is to be erected. The length"
954,NOTES.,of the whole is near five miles. On _L’isle Pelée_ and _Point Hommet_
955,NOTES.,"before-mentioned large fortifications are constructed bomb-proof, to"
956,NOTES.,defend the haven and pier. It is the opinion of some persons that
957,NOTES.,this stupendous mole may be injured or destroyed by what is called a
958,NOTES.,"ground-sea, _i. e._ a sea when the waters are agitated to the bottom: and"
959,NOTES.,"this happens when a strong wind, after having put the waves in motion,"
960,NOTES.,suddenly shifts to the opposite quarter. The description given in the
961,NOTES.,Poem of this vast undertaking closes with an allusion to this opinion.

1051,NOTES.,"the earldome of _Dorsett_, and the gift of many other possessions,"

1053,NOTES.,"in the declyninge of his age, calling to mynde the great effusion of"
1054,NOTES.,"blood which, from his infancie, he had shedd; he resolved to leave all"
1055,NOTES.,"worldly delights, and betake himself to a religious life, the better"
1056,NOTES.,"to contemplate on his former sinnes, and to obteyn pardon for them."
1057,NOTES.,"And, with much importunitie, having gotten leave of the kinge (who was"
1058,NOTES.,unwilling to want the assistance of so grave and worthy a counsellor)
1059,NOTES.,to resign his temporal honors; and having obteyned the bishoprick of
1060,NOTES.,"_Sarum_, he gave _Sherburne_, with other lands, to the bishoprick. To"
1061,NOTES.,which gift he annexed this curse:—
1062,NOTES.,
1063,NOTES.,"“‘That whosoever should take those lands from the bishoprick, or"

1066,NOTES.,restitution thereof.’ And so he died bishop of Sarum.”
1067,NOTES.,
1068,NOTES.,Those lands continued in the possession of his successors till the reign
1069,NOTES.,"of King Stephen, who took them away: “whereupon (says this account) his"
1070,NOTES.,"prosperity forsook him.” King Stephen being dead, “these lands came into"
1071,NOTES.,"the hands of some of the _Montagues_ (after earles of _Sarum_), who"
1072,NOTES.,"whilest they held the same, underwent many disasters. For one or other"
1073,NOTES.,"of them fell by misfortune. And finally, all the males of them became"
1074,NOTES.,"extinct, and the earldome received an end in their name. So ill was their"
1075,NOTES.,success.”
1076,NOTES.,
1077,NOTES.,After this the lands were restored to the bishoprick; but were taken away
1078,NOTES.,"a second time by the Duke of Somerset, in the reign of Edward VI.; “when"

1080,NOTES.,presently unto the kinge (to whome he was protector) and at his coming
1081,NOTES.,"up to _London_, was forthwith committed unto the _Tower_, and shortly"

1083,NOTES.,"the Bishop of Sarum; and so remained, “till Sir Walter Raleigh procured"
1084,NOTES.,"a grant of them; he afterwards unfortunately lost them, and at last his"

1099,NOTES.,and the dead (Bishop _Coldwell_). Yet the manifest judgements of God
1100,NOTES.,on both of them I may not pass over with silence. And to speak first
1101,NOTES.,"of the knight, who carried off the _Spolia opima_ of the bishoprick."
1102,NOTES.,"He, having gotten _Sherborne_ castle, park, and parsonage, was in those"
1103,NOTES.,"days in so great favour with the queen, as I may boldly say, that with"
1104,NOTES.,"less suit than he was fain to make to her, ere he could perfect this"
1105,NOTES.,"his purchase, and with less money than he bestowed since in _Sherborne_"
1106,NOTES.,"(in building, and buying out leases, and in drawing the river through"
1107,NOTES.,"rocks into his garden), he might, very justly, and without offence of"
1108,NOTES.,"either church or state, have compassed a much better purchase. Also, as"
1109,NOTES.,"I have been truly informed, he had a presage before he first attempted"
1110,NOTES.,"it, which did foreshow it would turn to his ruin, and might have kept"
1111,NOTES.,"him from meddling with it, _Si mens non læva fuisset_: for, as he was"
1112,NOTES.,riding post between _Plymouth_ and the court (as many times he did upon
1113,NOTES.,"no small employments), this castle being right in the way, he cast such"
1114,NOTES.,"an eye upon it as _Ahab_ did upon _Naboth_’s vineyard. And, once above"
1115,NOTES.,"the rest, being talking of it (of the commodiousness of the place,"
1116,NOTES.,"of the strength of the seat, and how easily it might be got from the"
1117,NOTES.,"bishoprick), suddenly over and over came his horse, that his very face"
1118,NOTES.,(which was then thought a very good face) plowed up the earth where he
1119,NOTES.,"fell. This fall was ominous, I make no question; and himself was apt to"
1120,NOTES.,construe it so. But his brother _Adrian_ would needs have him interpret
1121,NOTES.,"it as a conqueror, that his fall presaged the quiet possession of it."
1122,NOTES.,"And accordingly, for the present, it so fell out. So that with much"
1123,NOTES.,"labor, cost, envy, and obloquy, he got it _habendum et tenendum_ to him"
1124,NOTES.,and his heirs. But see what became of him. In the public joy and jubilee
1125,NOTES.,"of the whole realm (when favor, peace, and pardon, were offered even to"
1126,NOTES.,"offenders), he who in wit, in wealth, in courage, was inferior to few,"
