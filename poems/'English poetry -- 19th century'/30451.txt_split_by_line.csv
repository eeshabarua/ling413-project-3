74,A DAY WITH KEATS,
75,A DAY WITH KEATS,"About eight o'clock one morning in early summer, a young man may be"
76,A DAY WITH KEATS,"seen sauntering to and fro in the garden of Wentworth Place, Hampstead."
77,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Wentworth Place consists of two houses only; in the first, John Keats is"
78,A DAY WITH KEATS,established along with his friend Charles Armitage Brown. The second is
79,A DAY WITH KEATS,"inhabited by a Mrs. Brawne and her family. They are wooden houses, with"
80,A DAY WITH KEATS,festooning draperies of foliage: and the clean countrified air of
81,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Hampstead comes with sweet freshness through the gardens, and fills the"
82,A DAY WITH KEATS,"young man with ecstatic delight. He gazes around him, with his weak dark"
83,A DAY WITH KEATS,"eyes, upon the sky, the flowers, the various minutiæ of nature which"
84,A DAY WITH KEATS,mean so much to him: and although he has severely tried a never robust
85,A DAY WITH KEATS,"physique by sitting up half the night in study, a new exhilaration now"
86,A DAY WITH KEATS,"throbs through his veins. For, in his own words, he loves the principle"
87,A DAY WITH KEATS,"of beauty in all things: and he repeats to himself, as he loiters up and"
88,A DAY WITH KEATS,"down in the sunshine, the lines into which he has crystallized, for all"
89,A DAY WITH KEATS,"time, sensations similar to those of the present:--"
90,A DAY WITH KEATS,
91,A DAY WITH KEATS,A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
92,A DAY WITH KEATS,Its loveliness increases; it will never
93,A DAY WITH KEATS,Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
94,A DAY WITH KEATS,"A bower quiet for us, and a sleep"
95,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing."
96,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing"
97,A DAY WITH KEATS,"A flowery band to bind us to the earth,"
98,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth"
99,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,"
100,A DAY WITH KEATS,Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darken'd ways
101,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,"
102,A DAY WITH KEATS,Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
103,A DAY WITH KEATS,"From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,"
104,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon"
105,A DAY WITH KEATS,For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
106,A DAY WITH KEATS,With the green world they live in; and clear rills
107,A DAY WITH KEATS,That for themselves a cooling covert make
108,A DAY WITH KEATS,"'Gainst the hot season; the mid-forest brake,"
109,A DAY WITH KEATS,Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
110,A DAY WITH KEATS,And such too is the grandeur of the dooms
111,A DAY WITH KEATS,We have imagined for the mighty dead;
112,A DAY WITH KEATS,All lovely tales that we have heard or read:
113,A DAY WITH KEATS,"An endless fountain of immortal drink,"
114,A DAY WITH KEATS,Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.
115,A DAY WITH KEATS,Nor do we merely feel these essences
116,A DAY WITH KEATS,"For one short hour; no, even as the trees"
117,A DAY WITH KEATS,That whisper round a temple become soon
118,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon,"
119,A DAY WITH KEATS,"The passion poesy, glories infinite,"
120,A DAY WITH KEATS,Haunt us till they become a cheering light
121,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast,"
122,A DAY WITH KEATS,"That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast,"
123,A DAY WITH KEATS,"They alway must be with us, or we die."
124,A DAY WITH KEATS,_Endymion._
125,A DAY WITH KEATS,
126,A DAY WITH KEATS,Yet John Keats is in some respects out of keeping with the magnificent
127,A DAY WITH KEATS,"phraseology of which he is the mouthpiece. ""Little Keats,"" as his fellow"
128,A DAY WITH KEATS,"medical students termed him, is a small, undersized man, not over five feet"
129,A DAY WITH KEATS,"high--the shoulders too broad, the legs too spare--""death in his hand,"""
130,A DAY WITH KEATS,"as Coleridge said, the slack moist hand of the incipient consumptive."
131,A DAY WITH KEATS,"The only ""thing of beauty"" about him is his face. ""It is a face,"" to"
132,A DAY WITH KEATS,"quote his friend Leigh Hunt, ""in which energy and sensibility"" (i.e.,"
133,A DAY WITH KEATS,"sensitiveness) ""are remarkably mixed up--an eager power, wrecked and"
134,A DAY WITH KEATS,made impatient by ill-health. Every feature at once strongly cut and
135,A DAY WITH KEATS,"delicately alive."" There is that femininity in the cast of his features,"
136,A DAY WITH KEATS,which Coleridge classed as an attribute of true genius. His beautiful
137,A DAY WITH KEATS,"brown hair falls loosely over those eyes, large, dark, glowing, which"
138,A DAY WITH KEATS,appeal to all observers by their mystical illumination of rapture--eyes
139,A DAY WITH KEATS,which seem as though they had been dwelling on some glorious sight--which
140,A DAY WITH KEATS,"have, as Haydon said, ""an inward look perfectly divine, like a Delphian"
141,A DAY WITH KEATS,"priestess who saw visions."""
142,A DAY WITH KEATS,
143,A DAY WITH KEATS,And he _is_ seeing visions all the while. Some chance sight or sound has
144,A DAY WITH KEATS,"wrapt him away from the young greenness of the May morning, and plunged"
145,A DAY WITH KEATS,him deep into the opulent colour of September. His prophetic eye sees
146,A DAY WITH KEATS,"all the apple-buds as golden orbs of fruit, and the swallows, that now"
147,A DAY WITH KEATS,"build beneath the eaves, making ready for their departure. And these"
148,A DAY WITH KEATS,future splendours shape themselves into lines as richly coloured.

152,A DAY WITH KEATS,[_Painting by W. J. Neatby._          AUTUMN.
153,A DAY WITH KEATS,
154,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?"
155,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,--"
156,A DAY WITH KEATS,"While barrèd clouds bloom the soft-dying day,"
157,A DAY WITH KEATS,And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
158,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Then in a wailful choir, the small gnats mourn"
159,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Among the river sallows, borne aloft"
160,A DAY WITH KEATS,Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies ...]
161,A DAY WITH KEATS,
162,A DAY WITH KEATS,*       *       *       *       *
163,A DAY WITH KEATS,
164,A DAY WITH KEATS,Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness!
165,A DAY WITH KEATS,Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
166,A DAY WITH KEATS,Conspiring with him how to load and bless
167,A DAY WITH KEATS,With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;
168,A DAY WITH KEATS,"To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,"
169,A DAY WITH KEATS,And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
170,A DAY WITH KEATS,"To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells"
171,A DAY WITH KEATS,"With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,"
172,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And still more, later flowers for the bees,"
173,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Until they think warm days will never cease,"
174,A DAY WITH KEATS,For Summer has o'er-brimmed their clammy cells.
175,A DAY WITH KEATS,
176,A DAY WITH KEATS,Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
177,A DAY WITH KEATS,Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
178,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,"
179,A DAY WITH KEATS,Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
180,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,"
181,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook"
182,A DAY WITH KEATS,Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers;
183,A DAY WITH KEATS,And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
184,A DAY WITH KEATS,Steady thy laden head across a brook;
185,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Or by a cider-press, with patient look,"
186,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Thou watchest the last oozings, hours by hours."
187,A DAY WITH KEATS,
188,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?"
189,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,"
190,A DAY WITH KEATS,"While barrèd clouds bloom the soft-dying day,"
191,A DAY WITH KEATS,And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
192,A DAY WITH KEATS,Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
193,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Among the river sallows, borne aloft"
194,A DAY WITH KEATS,Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
195,A DAY WITH KEATS,And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
196,A DAY WITH KEATS,Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
197,A DAY WITH KEATS,The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft.
198,A DAY WITH KEATS,And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.
199,A DAY WITH KEATS,_Autumn._
200,A DAY WITH KEATS,
201,A DAY WITH KEATS,"The voice of Charles Brown at the open window, hailing him cheerily,"
202,A DAY WITH KEATS,"breaks the spell; Keats goes in, and they sit down together to a simple"
203,A DAY WITH KEATS,"breakfast-table, and Brown ""quizzes"" Keats, as the current phrase goes,"
204,A DAY WITH KEATS,"on his inveterate abstractedness. The young man, with his sweet and"
205,A DAY WITH KEATS,"merry laugh, defends himself by producing the result of his last-night's"
206,A DAY WITH KEATS,"meditations, in praise of the selfsame wandering fancy."
207,A DAY WITH KEATS,
208,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Ever let the Fancy roam,"
209,A DAY WITH KEATS,Pleasure never is at home:
210,A DAY WITH KEATS,"At a touch sweet Pleasure melteth,"
211,A DAY WITH KEATS,Like to bubbles when rain pelteth;
212,A DAY WITH KEATS,Then let wingèd Fancy wander
213,A DAY WITH KEATS,Through the thought still spread beyond her:
214,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Open wide the mind's cage door,"
215,A DAY WITH KEATS,"She'll dart forth, and cloudward soar."
216,A DAY WITH KEATS,"O, sweet Fancy! let her loose;"
217,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Summer's joys are spoilt by use,"
218,A DAY WITH KEATS,And the enjoying of the Spring
219,A DAY WITH KEATS,Fades as does its blossoming:
220,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Autumn's red-lipp'd fruitage too,"
221,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Blushing through the mist and dew,"
222,A DAY WITH KEATS,Cloys with tasting: What do then?
223,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Sit thee by the ingle, when"
224,A DAY WITH KEATS,"The sear faggot blazes bright,"
225,A DAY WITH KEATS,Spirit of a winter's night;
226,A DAY WITH KEATS,"When the soundless earth is muffled,"
227,A DAY WITH KEATS,And the caked snow is shuffled
228,A DAY WITH KEATS,From the ploughboy's heavy shoon....
229,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Fancy, high-commission'd:--send her!"
230,A DAY WITH KEATS,She has vassals to attend her:
231,A DAY WITH KEATS,"She will bring, in spite of frost,"
232,A DAY WITH KEATS,Beauties that the earth hath lost;
233,A DAY WITH KEATS,"She will bring thee, all together,"
234,A DAY WITH KEATS,All delights of summer weather;
235,A DAY WITH KEATS,"All the buds and bells of May,"
236,A DAY WITH KEATS,From dewy sward or thorny spray;
237,A DAY WITH KEATS,"All the heapèd Autumn's wealth,"
238,A DAY WITH KEATS,"With a still, mysterious stealth:"
239,A DAY WITH KEATS,"She will mix these pleasures up,"
240,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Like three fit wines in a cup,"
241,A DAY WITH KEATS,And thou shalt quaff it....
242,A DAY WITH KEATS,_Fancy._
243,A DAY WITH KEATS,
244,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Breakfast over, the business of the day begins: and that, with Keats, is"
245,A DAY WITH KEATS,"poetry, and all that can foster poetic stimulus. He takes no real heed"
246,A DAY WITH KEATS,"of anything else. A devoted son and brother, one ready to sacrifice"
247,A DAY WITH KEATS,himself and his slender resources to the uttermost farthing for his
248,A DAY WITH KEATS,"mother, brothers, sister and friends--yet he has no vital interest in"
249,A DAY WITH KEATS,"other folks' affairs, nor in current events, nor in ordinary social"
250,A DAY WITH KEATS,"topics. Other people's poetry does not appeal to him, except that of"
251,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Shakespeare, and of Homer--whom he does not know in the original, but"
252,A DAY WITH KEATS,"who, through the poor medium of translation, has filled his soul with"
253,A DAY WITH KEATS,Grecian fantasies.
254,A DAY WITH KEATS,
255,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,"
256,A DAY WITH KEATS,And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
257,A DAY WITH KEATS,Round many western islands have I been
258,A DAY WITH KEATS,Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
259,A DAY WITH KEATS,Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
260,A DAY WITH KEATS,That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne:
261,A DAY WITH KEATS,Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
262,A DAY WITH KEATS,Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
263,A DAY WITH KEATS,Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
264,A DAY WITH KEATS,When a new planet swims into his ken;
265,A DAY WITH KEATS,Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
266,A DAY WITH KEATS,He stared at the Pacific--and all his men
267,A DAY WITH KEATS,Look'd at each other with a wild surmise--
268,A DAY WITH KEATS,Silent upon a peak in Darien.
269,A DAY WITH KEATS,_Sonnet._
270,A DAY WITH KEATS,
271,A DAY WITH KEATS,This is what he wrote after sitting up one night till daybreak with his
272,A DAY WITH KEATS,"friend Cowden Clarke, shouting with delight over the vistas newly"
273,A DAY WITH KEATS,"revealed to him. And from that time on, he has luxuriated in dreams of"
274,A DAY WITH KEATS,"classic beauty, warmed to new life by the sorcery of Romance. Immortal"
275,A DAY WITH KEATS,"shapes arise upon him from the ""infinite azure of the past:"" and he sees"
276,A DAY WITH KEATS,how
277,A DAY WITH KEATS,
278,A DAY WITH KEATS,Deep in the shady sadness of a vale
279,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,"
280,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star,"
281,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Sat gray-hair'd Saturn, quiet as a stone,"
282,A DAY WITH KEATS,Still as the silence round about his lair;
283,A DAY WITH KEATS,Forest on forest hung about his head
284,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,"
285,A DAY WITH KEATS,Not so much life as on a summer's day
286,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass,"
287,A DAY WITH KEATS,"But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest."
288,A DAY WITH KEATS,"A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more"
289,A DAY WITH KEATS,By reason of his fallen divinity
290,A DAY WITH KEATS,Spreading a shade: the Naiad 'mid her reeds
291,A DAY WITH KEATS,Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips.
292,A DAY WITH KEATS,_Hyperion._
293,A DAY WITH KEATS,
294,A DAY WITH KEATS,"He is studying French, Latin, and especially Italian--all with a view of"
295,A DAY WITH KEATS,"furthering his poetic ability: though no great reader, he has soaked"
296,A DAY WITH KEATS,"himself in the atmosphere of old Italian tales, and the very spirit of"
297,A DAY WITH KEATS,"mediæval Florence breathes from the story, borrowed from Boccaccio, ""an"
298,A DAY WITH KEATS,"echo in the north-wind sung,"" which narrates how the hapless Isabelle"
299,A DAY WITH KEATS,bid away the head of her murdered lover.

304,A DAY WITH KEATS,
305,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And she forgot the stars, the moon, the sun,"
306,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And she forgot the blue above the trees,"
307,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And she forgot the dells where waters run,"
308,A DAY WITH KEATS,And she forgot the chilly autumn breeze;
309,A DAY WITH KEATS,"She had no knowledge when the day was done,"
310,A DAY WITH KEATS,And the new moon she saw not: but in peace
311,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Hung over her sweet Basil evermore,"
312,A DAY WITH KEATS,And moisten'd it with tears unto the core.]
313,A DAY WITH KEATS,
314,A DAY WITH KEATS,*       *       *       *       *
315,A DAY WITH KEATS,
316,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Then in a silken scarf,--sweet with the dews"
317,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Of precious flowers pluck'd in Araby,"
318,A DAY WITH KEATS,And divine liquids come with odorous ooze
319,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Through the cold serpent-pipe refreshfully,--"
320,A DAY WITH KEATS,She wrapp'd it up; and for its tomb did choose
321,A DAY WITH KEATS,"A garden pot, wherein she laid it by,"
322,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And covered it with mould, and o'er it set"
323,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Sweet Basil, which her tears kept ever wet."
324,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And she forgot the stars, the moon, and sun,"
325,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And she forgot the blue above the trees,"
326,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And she forgot the dells where waters run,"
327,A DAY WITH KEATS,And she forgot the chilly autumn breeze;
328,A DAY WITH KEATS,"She had no knowledge when the day was done,"
329,A DAY WITH KEATS,And the new moon she saw not: but in peace
330,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Hung over her sweet Basil evermore,"
331,A DAY WITH KEATS,And moisten'd it with tears unto the core.
332,A DAY WITH KEATS,_Isabella._
333,A DAY WITH KEATS,
334,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Keats has brought himself with difficulty, however, to the perusal of"
335,A DAY WITH KEATS,modern poets. His boyish enthusiasm for Leigh Hunt's work has long since
336,A DAY WITH KEATS,"evaporated: and after reading Shelley's _Revolt of Islam_, all he has"
337,A DAY WITH KEATS,"found to say is, ""Poor Shelley, I think he has his quota of good"
338,A DAY WITH KEATS,"qualities!"" But, for the rest, he is not attracted to any kind of"
339,A DAY WITH KEATS,"knowledge which cannot be ""made applicable and subservient to the"
340,A DAY WITH KEATS,"purposes of poetry,""--his own poetry. For his one desire is to win an"
341,A DAY WITH KEATS,"immortal name--and he has begun life ""full of hopes, fiery, impetuous,"
342,A DAY WITH KEATS,"and ungovernable, expecting the world to fall at once beneath his pen."
343,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Poor fellow!"" (Haydon's diary)."
344,A DAY WITH KEATS,
345,A DAY WITH KEATS,"But ""men of genius,"" Keats himself has said, ""are as great as certain"
346,A DAY WITH KEATS,"ethereal chemicals, operating in a mass of created matter: but they have"
347,A DAY WITH KEATS,"not any determined character."" That indefiniteness of literary aim--that"
348,A DAY WITH KEATS,"want of willpower, without which genius is a curse, which have hampered"
349,A DAY WITH KEATS,the young man all along--are now still further emphasised by the
350,A DAY WITH KEATS,restlessness of a passionate lover. John Keats cannot stay indoors this
351,A DAY WITH KEATS,"fine May morning, ""fitting himself for verses fit to live,"" when the"
352,A DAY WITH KEATS,girl who is to him the incarnation of all poetry is visible in the
353,A DAY WITH KEATS,next-door garden. He throws down his pen and hurries out to join her.
354,A DAY WITH KEATS,
355,A DAY WITH KEATS,Contemporary portraits of Fanny Brawne have not succeeded in representing
356,A DAY WITH KEATS,"her as beautiful: and at first sight Keats has complained, that, although"
357,A DAY WITH KEATS,"she ""manages to make her hair look well,"" she ""wants sentiment in every"
358,A DAY WITH KEATS,"feature."" Propinquity, however, has achieved the usual result; and now"
359,A DAY WITH KEATS,the young poet believes his inamorata to be the very apotheosis of
360,A DAY WITH KEATS,loveliness: he is never weary of adoring her
361,A DAY WITH KEATS,
362,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Sweet voice, sweet lips, soft hand, and softer breast,"
363,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Warm breath, light whisper, tender semitone,"
364,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Bright eyes, accomplished shape!"
365,A DAY WITH KEATS,
366,A DAY WITH KEATS,"If the truth be told, Fanny Brawne is a fairly good-looking young woman,"
367,A DAY WITH KEATS,"blue-eyed and long-nosed, her hair arranged with curls and ribbons over"
368,A DAY WITH KEATS,her brow: she has a curious but striking resemblance to the draped
369,A DAY WITH KEATS,"figure in Titian's ""Sacred and Profane Love"": and for the rest, she is"
370,A DAY WITH KEATS,"by no means poetic or sentimental, but a voluminous reader, whose strong"
371,A DAY WITH KEATS,point is an extraordinary knowledge of the history of costume. She
372,A DAY WITH KEATS,"accepts the homage of Keats, much as she accepts the fact of their tacit"
373,A DAY WITH KEATS,"betrothal, and the fact that her mother disapproves of it--without"
374,A DAY WITH KEATS,"taking it too seriously in any sense. And now, though not particularly"
375,A DAY WITH KEATS,"keen on open-air enjoyment, she accepts his daily suggestion of a walk"
376,A DAY WITH KEATS,with her; and they go out into the beautiful meadows which were part of
377,A DAY WITH KEATS,Hampstead a hundred years ago.
378,A DAY WITH KEATS,

395,A DAY WITH KEATS,"'Tis not with envy of thy happy lot,"
396,A DAY WITH KEATS,"But being too happy in thine happiness,--"
397,A DAY WITH KEATS,"That thou, light-wingèd Dryad of the trees,"
398,A DAY WITH KEATS,In some melodious plot
399,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,"
400,A DAY WITH KEATS,Singest of summer in full-throated ease.
401,A DAY WITH KEATS,
402,A DAY WITH KEATS,"O, for a draught of vintage, that hath been"

419,A DAY WITH KEATS,Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
420,A DAY WITH KEATS,And leaden-eyed despairs;

424,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!"
425,A DAY WITH KEATS,No hungry generations tread thee down;
426,A DAY WITH KEATS,The voice I hear this passing night was heard
427,A DAY WITH KEATS,In ancient days by emperor and clown:
428,A DAY WITH KEATS,Perhaps the self-same song that found a path
429,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Through the sad heart of Ruth, when sick for home,"
430,A DAY WITH KEATS,She stood in tears amid the alien corn;
431,A DAY WITH KEATS,That same that oft-times hath
432,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam"
433,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn."
434,A DAY WITH KEATS,
435,A DAY WITH KEATS,Forlorn! the very word is like a bell

437,A DAY WITH KEATS,Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well
438,A DAY WITH KEATS,"As she is famed to do, deceiving elf."
439,A DAY WITH KEATS,Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades
440,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Past the near meadows, over the still stream,"
441,A DAY WITH KEATS,Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep
442,A DAY WITH KEATS,In the next valley-glades:

455,A DAY WITH KEATS,
456,A DAY WITH KEATS,The poet is recalled from these rapturous flights to the fugitive
457,A DAY WITH KEATS,"sweetness of the present: he is wandering in May meadows, young and"
458,A DAY WITH KEATS,"impetuous, on fire with hopes, and his heart's beloved beside him. It is"
459,A DAY WITH KEATS,"almost too good to be true. ""I have never known any unalloyed happiness"
460,A DAY WITH KEATS,"for many days together,"" he tells Fanny; ""the death or sickness of"
461,A DAY WITH KEATS,"someone has always spoilt my home. I almost wish we were butterflies,"
462,A DAY WITH KEATS,and lived but three summer days--three such days with you I could fill
463,A DAY WITH KEATS,"with more delight than fifty common years could ever contain."" He talks"
464,A DAY WITH KEATS,"to her earnestly of his dreams, his aspirations, his ambitions: and then"
465,A DAY WITH KEATS,the sordid facts of every-day life begin to cast a blighting shadow over
466,A DAY WITH KEATS,"his effulgent hopes. What has he, indeed, to offer, worth her taking? A"
467,A DAY WITH KEATS,"young man of twenty-three, ex-dresser at a hospital, who has abandoned"
468,A DAY WITH KEATS,"his surgical career without adopting any other: with slender resources,"
469,A DAY WITH KEATS,and no occupation beyond that of producing verses which are held up to
470,A DAY WITH KEATS,"absolute derision by the great reviews. ""I would willingly have recourse"
471,A DAY WITH KEATS,"to other means,"" he tells her again, as he has told his friend Dilke, ""I"
472,A DAY WITH KEATS,"cannot: I am fit for nothing else but literature."" He talks of taking up"
473,A DAY WITH KEATS,"journalism--but in his heart he feels unfit for any regular profession,"
474,A DAY WITH KEATS,by reason both of physical weakness and a certain lack of system in mental
475,A DAY WITH KEATS,"work. The future becomes blackly, blankly overcast; the _res augusta"
476,A DAY WITH KEATS,domi_ descend like a curtain between the sublimity of Keats and the calm
477,A DAY WITH KEATS,"commonsense of Fanny. They turn homewards in silence, the poet revolving"
478,A DAY WITH KEATS,melancholy musings.
479,A DAY WITH KEATS,
480,A DAY WITH KEATS,But when the melancholy fit shall fall
481,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,"
482,A DAY WITH KEATS,"That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,"
483,A DAY WITH KEATS,And hides the green hill in an April shroud;
484,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,"
485,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,"
486,A DAY WITH KEATS,Or on the wealth of globèd peonies;
487,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,"
488,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Emprison her soft hand, and let rave,"
489,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes."
490,A DAY WITH KEATS,
491,A DAY WITH KEATS,She dwells with Beauty--Beauty that must die;
492,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips"
493,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh,"
494,A DAY WITH KEATS,Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips.
495,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Ay, in the very temple of Delight"
496,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine,"
497,A DAY WITH KEATS,Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue
498,A DAY WITH KEATS,Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;

502,A DAY WITH KEATS,
503,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Fanny Brawne enters her mother's house, and John Keats goes into his"

515,A DAY WITH KEATS,Their green felicity:
516,A DAY WITH KEATS,"The north cannot undo them,"

547,A DAY WITH KEATS,
548,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Yet Keats is young, and youth means buoyancy. With an effort--increasingly"
549,A DAY WITH KEATS,difficult--he is able to shake off this sombre fit for awhile; and he
550,A DAY WITH KEATS,"makes use of the simplest means to that end. ""Whenever I feel vapourish,"""
551,A DAY WITH KEATS,"he has said, ""I rouse myself, wash, and put on a clean shirt; brush my"
552,A DAY WITH KEATS,"hair and clothes, tie my shoe-strings neatly, and in fact adonize as if"
553,A DAY WITH KEATS,"I were going out: then, all clean and comfortable, I sit down to write."""
554,A DAY WITH KEATS,"These very prosaic methods adopted, he abandons himself to the full"

572,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And diamonded with panes of quaint device,"
573,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Innumerable of stains and splendid dyes,"

589,A DAY WITH KEATS,
590,A DAY WITH KEATS,"But the inspiration does not well up to-day: its flow is frustrated,"
591,A DAY WITH KEATS,"in view of the mountainous difficulties which hedge him in. Ill-health,"
592,A DAY WITH KEATS,"stinted means, hopeless love, and continual lack of success--these are"
593,A DAY WITH KEATS,"calculated to give the bravest pause. And presently Keats, snatching a"
594,A DAY WITH KEATS,"few hurried mouthfuls of lunch, is off to the studio of his friend, the"
595,A DAY WITH KEATS,painter Haydon--the one man among all his acquaintance who is capable of
596,A DAY WITH KEATS,really understanding him. He sits down morbid and silent in the painting
597,A DAY WITH KEATS,"room: for a while nothing will evoke a word from him, good or bad. But"
598,A DAY WITH KEATS,"his keen interest in matters of art, and the entry of various friends one"
599,A DAY WITH KEATS,"by one--Wentworth Dilke, Hamilton Reynolds, Bailey and Leigh Hunt--soon"
600,A DAY WITH KEATS,arouse him to animated conversation. Keats is shy and ill at ease in
601,A DAY WITH KEATS,"women's society: but a ""delightful combination of earnestness and"
602,A DAY WITH KEATS,"pleasantry distinguishes his intercourse with men."" He says fine things"
603,A DAY WITH KEATS,"finely, jokes with ready humour, and at the mention of any oppression or"
604,A DAY WITH KEATS,"wrong rises ""into grave manliness at once, seeming like a tall man."""
605,A DAY WITH KEATS,"No wonder that his society is much sought after, and himself greatly"
606,A DAY WITH KEATS,"beloved by these congenial spirits; no wonder that here, at least, he"
607,A DAY WITH KEATS,meets with that appreciation of which elsewhere his genius has been
608,A DAY WITH KEATS,"starved. In this young fellow of twenty-three, who unites winning,"
609,A DAY WITH KEATS,"affectionate ways, and habitual gentleness of manner, with the loftiest"
610,A DAY WITH KEATS,"and most nobly-worded ideals, few would discover that imaginary ""Johnny"
611,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Keats, the apothecary's assistant,"" upon whom the _Blackwood_ reviewer"
612,A DAY WITH KEATS,had lavished such vials of vituperation. He is here openly acknowledged
613,A DAY WITH KEATS,"as one of the ""bards of passion and of mirth,"" and his poems are each"
614,A DAY WITH KEATS,"accepted, as"
615,A DAY WITH KEATS,
616,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Not a senseless, tranced thing,"
617,A DAY WITH KEATS,"But divine melodies of truth,"
618,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Philosophic numbers smooth,"
619,A DAY WITH KEATS,Tales and golden histories
620,A DAY WITH KEATS,Of heaven and its mysteries....
621,A DAY WITH KEATS,
622,A DAY WITH KEATS,"""No one else in English poetry, save Shakespeare, has in expression"
623,A DAY WITH KEATS,"quite the fascinating felicity of Keats, his perfection of loveliness."""
624,A DAY WITH KEATS,(Matthew Arnold). But only these few friends of his are able to
625,A DAY WITH KEATS,"recognise that perfection. Outside their charmed circle, lies an"
626,A DAY WITH KEATS,obstinately unappreciative world.
627,A DAY WITH KEATS,
628,A DAY WITH KEATS,"The afternoon wears on, and the friends disperse. Keats, returning to"
629,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Wentworth Place flushed with hectic exhilaration, finds a veritable"
630,A DAY WITH KEATS,"douche of cold water awaiting him, in the shape of a letter from his"
631,A DAY WITH KEATS,"publishers. They refer to his unlucky first volume of poems, brought out"
632,A DAY WITH KEATS,"in 1817. ""By far the greater number of persons who have purchased it from"
633,A DAY WITH KEATS,"us,"" they say, ""have found fault with it in such plain terms, that we"
634,A DAY WITH KEATS,"have in many cases offered to take the book back, rather than be annoyed"
635,A DAY WITH KEATS,with the ridicule which has time after time been showered upon it. In
636,A DAY WITH KEATS,"fact, it was only on Sunday last that we were under the mortification of"
637,A DAY WITH KEATS,having our own opinion of its merits flatly contradicted by a gentleman
638,A DAY WITH KEATS,"who told us that he considered it 'no better than a take-in.'"""
639,A DAY WITH KEATS,
640,A DAY WITH KEATS,For a few minutes the pendulum swings back to despair. A man whose whole
641,A DAY WITH KEATS,"business in life is the creation of the best work, who ""never wrote a"
642,A DAY WITH KEATS,"line of poetry with the least shadow of public thought,"" who believes"
643,A DAY WITH KEATS,"that after his death he will be among the English poets, and that if he"
644,A DAY WITH KEATS,"only has time now, he will make himself remembered--that such a one"
645,A DAY WITH KEATS,should be merely the butt and laughing-stock of his readers! It is
646,A DAY WITH KEATS,an unendurable position. Not that Keats attaches undue importance to
647,A DAY WITH KEATS,"popular applause. ""Praise or blame,"" he says, ""has but a momentary"
648,A DAY WITH KEATS,effect upon the man whose love of beauty in the abstract makes him a
649,A DAY WITH KEATS,severe critic on his own works.... In _Endymion_ I leaped headlong into
650,A DAY WITH KEATS,"the sea, and thereby have become better acquainted with the soundings,"
651,A DAY WITH KEATS,"the quicksands, and the rocks, than if I had stayed upon the green shore"
652,A DAY WITH KEATS,and took tea and comfortable advice. I was never afraid of failure: for
653,A DAY WITH KEATS,"I would sooner fail than not be among the greatest."""
654,A DAY WITH KEATS,
655,A DAY WITH KEATS,But what will Fanny think of such a letter? He falls to miserable
656,A DAY WITH KEATS,"meditation over the slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune, and the"
657,A DAY WITH KEATS,constant erection of new obstacles in the course of his luckless love.
658,A DAY WITH KEATS,And of Fanny's love he always has had a smouldering doubt: yet he
659,A DAY WITH KEATS,"remains her vassal, from the first, as he has told her--irrevocably her"
660,A DAY WITH KEATS,"slave. He conceives himself an outcast on the wintry hillside, exiled"
661,A DAY WITH KEATS,from all his heart's desires.
662,A DAY WITH KEATS,
663,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Ah, what can ail thee, wretched wight,"
664,A DAY WITH KEATS,Alone and palely loitering?
665,A DAY WITH KEATS,"The sedge is wither'd from the lake,"
666,A DAY WITH KEATS,And no birds sing.
667,A DAY WITH KEATS,
668,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Ah what can ail thee, wretched wight,"
669,A DAY WITH KEATS,So haggard and so woe-begone?
670,A DAY WITH KEATS,"The squirrel's granary is full,"
671,A DAY WITH KEATS,And the harvest's done.
672,A DAY WITH KEATS,
673,A DAY WITH KEATS,"I see a lily on thy brow,"
674,A DAY WITH KEATS,With anguish moist and fever dew;
675,A DAY WITH KEATS,And on thy cheek a fading rose
676,A DAY WITH KEATS,Fast withereth too.
677,A DAY WITH KEATS,
678,A DAY WITH KEATS,I met a lady in the meads
679,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Full beautiful, a faery's child;"
680,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Her hair was long, her foot was light,"
681,A DAY WITH KEATS,And her eyes were wild.
682,A DAY WITH KEATS,
683,A DAY WITH KEATS,"I set her on my pacing steed,"
684,A DAY WITH KEATS,And nothing else saw all day long;
685,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And sideways would she lean, and sing"
686,A DAY WITH KEATS,A faery's song.
687,A DAY WITH KEATS,
688,A DAY WITH KEATS,"I made a garland for her head,"
689,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;"
690,A DAY WITH KEATS,"She look'd at me and she did love,"
691,A DAY WITH KEATS,And made sweet moan.
692,A DAY WITH KEATS,
693,A DAY WITH KEATS,"She found me roots of relish sweet,"
694,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And honey wild, and manna dew;"
695,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And sure in language strange she said,"
696,A DAY WITH KEATS,I love thee true.
697,A DAY WITH KEATS,
698,A DAY WITH KEATS,"She took me to her elfin grot,"
699,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And there she gaz'd and sighed deep,"
700,A DAY WITH KEATS,And there I shut her wild sad eyes--
701,A DAY WITH KEATS,So kiss'd to sleep.
702,A DAY WITH KEATS,
703,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And there we slumber'd on the moss,"
704,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And there I dream'd, ah woe betide,"
705,A DAY WITH KEATS,The latest dream I ever dream'd
706,A DAY WITH KEATS,On the cold hill side.
707,A DAY WITH KEATS,
708,A DAY WITH KEATS,"I saw pale kings, and princes too,"
709,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;"
710,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Who cried--""La belle Dame sans merci"
711,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Hath thee in thrall!"""
712,A DAY WITH KEATS,
713,A DAY WITH KEATS,I saw their starv'd lips in the gloam
714,A DAY WITH KEATS,"With horrid warning gaped wide,"
715,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And I awoke, and found me here"
716,A DAY WITH KEATS,On the cold hill side.
717,A DAY WITH KEATS,
718,A DAY WITH KEATS,And this is why I sojourn here
719,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Alone and palely loitering,"
720,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Though the sedge is wither'd from the lake,"
721,A DAY WITH KEATS,And no birds sing.
722,A DAY WITH KEATS,_La Belle Dame sans merci._
723,A DAY WITH KEATS,
724,A DAY WITH KEATS,And now he hears the voice of his Belle Dame ringing light across the
725,A DAY WITH KEATS,"garden; while he sits here, a prey to every distress, she is gaily"
726,A DAY WITH KEATS,gossiping with her next-door neighbour Brown. At once the unhappy Keats
727,A DAY WITH KEATS,is tormented by a thousand jealous fears. Fanny is transferring her
728,A DAY WITH KEATS,affection to Brown: of that he is quite certain. He rushes out: his
729,A DAY WITH KEATS,"black looks banish the much-amused Brown, and very nearly produce an"
730,A DAY WITH KEATS,immediate rupture between Fanny and himself. But after a few bitter
731,A DAY WITH KEATS,"words, he permits himself to be reassured--or is it cajoled?--and tells"
732,A DAY WITH KEATS,"her, ""I must confess that I love you the more, in that I believe you"
733,A DAY WITH KEATS,"have liked me for my own sake and for nothing else."" The poor boy, from"
734,A DAY WITH KEATS,"a worldly point of view, has ""nothing else"" to offer."
735,A DAY WITH KEATS,
736,A DAY WITH KEATS,The lovers' quarrel is over for the nonce. Visitors begin to drop in for
737,A DAY WITH KEATS,the evening; there is music and singing in Brown's little drawing room.
738,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Keats is very fond of music, and can himself, though possessing hardly"
739,A DAY WITH KEATS,"any voice, ""produce a pleasing musical effect."" He will sit and listen"
740,A DAY WITH KEATS,"for hours to a sympathetic performer: but his ear, like all his faculties,"
741,A DAY WITH KEATS,is abnormally sensitive: and a wrong note will drive him into a frenzy.
742,A DAY WITH KEATS,"As the room grows fuller, he becomes restive. ""The poetical character,"""
743,A DAY WITH KEATS,"he has observed, ""is not itself--it has no character. When I am in a"
744,A DAY WITH KEATS,"room with people, the identity of everyone in the room begins to press"
745,A DAY WITH KEATS,"upon me so that I am in a little time annihilated."""
746,A DAY WITH KEATS,
747,A DAY WITH KEATS,In the light chit-chat of small talk and badinage he has no part: it
748,A DAY WITH KEATS,bewilders and annoys him. Those about him--especially the women--seem
749,A DAY WITH KEATS,"to show up in their worst colours. Fanny herself appears, as he has"
750,A DAY WITH KEATS,"described her at their first meeting, an absolute _minx_. And presently"
751,A DAY WITH KEATS,"he contrives to slip stealthily away, and seats himself in some quiet"
752,A DAY WITH KEATS,"chamber, alone with the darkness and the May-scents of leaf and blossom."
753,A DAY WITH KEATS,"""I hope I shall never marry,"" he groans once more; ""the roaring wind is"
754,A DAY WITH KEATS,"my wife, and the stars through the window-panes are my children: the"
755,A DAY WITH KEATS,"mighty abstract idea of Beauty I have in all things, stifles the more"
756,A DAY WITH KEATS,"divided and minute domestic happiness. I do not live in this world alone,"
757,A DAY WITH KEATS,"but in a thousand worlds. No sooner am I alone, than shapes of epic"
758,A DAY WITH KEATS,"greatness are stationed round me, and serve my spirit the office which"
759,A DAY WITH KEATS,"is equivalent to a King's Bodyguard."""
760,A DAY WITH KEATS,
761,A DAY WITH KEATS,"The young man now lights his candles, and takes up a familiar and"
762,A DAY WITH KEATS,favourite occupation;--the writing of a long letter to his brother
763,A DAY WITH KEATS,"George in America. This epistle is, as one might expect, almost"
764,A DAY WITH KEATS,entirely concerned with the art of poetry--what else has Keats to write
765,A DAY WITH KEATS,"about?--whether from the side of technique, or inspiration. He dwells on"
766,A DAY WITH KEATS,"the adroit management of open and close vowels--he shows how ""the poetry"
767,A DAY WITH KEATS,"of earth is never dead;"" he discusses the need of constant application"
768,A DAY WITH KEATS,"to work, and how ""the genius of poetry must work out its own salvation"
769,A DAY WITH KEATS,"in a man."" And meanwhile, as fitful strains of song reach him from the"
770,A DAY WITH KEATS,"distance, and his roving gaze rivets itself upon a Wedgwood copy of a"
771,A DAY WITH KEATS,Grecian vase--one of Brown's chief treasures--the fleeting wafts of
772,A DAY WITH KEATS,"sound, and the lovely symmetry of shape, and the golden chain of"

782,A DAY WITH KEATS,What men or gods are these? what maidens loath?

786,A DAY WITH KEATS,"Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard"

815,A DAY WITH KEATS,"And, little town, thy streets for evermore"
