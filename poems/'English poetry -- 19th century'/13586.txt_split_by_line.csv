101,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.
102,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,
103,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"The Poem begins with the description of an obscure village, and of"
104,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,the pleasing melancholy which it excites on being revisited after a
105,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,long absence. This mixed sensation is an effect of the Memory. From
106,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,an effect we naturally ascend to the cause; and the subject proposed
107,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,is then unfolded with an investigation of the nature and leading
108,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,principles of this faculty.
109,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,
110,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"It is evident that our ideas flow in continual succession, and"
111,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,introduce each other with a certain degree of regularity. They are
112,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"sometimes excited by sensible objects, and sometimes by an internal"
113,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,operation of the mind. Of the former species is most probably the
114,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"memory of brutes; and its many sources of pleasure to them, as well as"
115,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"to us, are considered in the first part. The latter is the most perfect"
116,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"degree of memory, and forms the subject of the second."
117,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,
118,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"When ideas have any relation whatever, they are attractive of each"
119,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,other in the mind; and the perception of any object naturally leads
120,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"to the idea of another, which was connected with it either in time"
121,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"or place, or which can be compared or contrasted with it. Hence"
122,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"arises our attachment to inanimate objects; hence also, in some"
123,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"degree, the love of our country, and the emotion with which we"
124,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,contemplate the celebrated scenes of antiquity. Hence a picture
125,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"directs our thoughts to the original: and, as cold and darkness"
126,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"suggest forcibly the ideas of heat and light, he, who feels the"
127,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"infirmities of age, dwells most on whatever reminds him of the vigour"
128,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,and vivacity of his youth.
129,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,
130,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"The associating principle, as here employed, is no less conducive to"
131,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"virtue than to happiness; and, as such, it frequently discovers"
132,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,itself in the most tumultuous scenes of life. It addresses our finer
133,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"feelings, and gives exercise to every mild and generous propensity."
134,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,
135,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,"Not confined to man, it extends through all animated nature; and its"
136,ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST PART.,effects are peculiarly striking in the domestic tribes.

138,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY
139,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,
140,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Twilight’s soft dews steal o’er the village-green,"
141,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,With magic tints to harmonize the scene.
142,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Still’d is the hum that thro’ the hamlet broke,"
143,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,When round the ruins of their antient oak
144,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The peasants flock’d to hear the minstrel play,"
145,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And games and carols clos’d the busy day.
146,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Her wheel at rest, the matron thrills no more"
147,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"With treasur’d tales, and legendary lore."
148,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"All, all are fled; nor mirth nor music flows"
149,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,To chase the dreams of innocent repose.
150,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"All, all are fled; yet still I linger here!"
151,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,What secret charms this silent spot endear?
152,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Mark yon old Mansion frowning thro’ the trees.
153,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Whose hollow turret wooes the whistling breeze.
154,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"That casement, arch’d with ivy’s brownest shade,"
155,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,First to these eyes the light of heav’n convey’d.
156,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The mouldering gateway strews the grass-grown court,"
157,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Once the calm scene of many a simple sport;
158,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When nature pleas’d, for life itself was new,"
159,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And the heart promis’d what the fancy drew.
160,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"See, thro’ the fractur’d pediment reveal’d,"
161,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Where moss inlays the rudely-sculptur’d shield,"
162,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The martin’s old, hereditary nest."
163,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Long may the ruin spare its hallow’d guest!
164,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"As jars the hinge, what sullen echoes call!"
165,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Oh haste, unfold the hospitable hall!"
166,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"That hall, where once, in antiquated state,"
167,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The chair of justice held the grave debate.
168,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Now stain’d with dews, with cobwebs darkly hung,"
169,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Oft has its roof with peals of rapture rung;
170,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When round yon ample board, in due degree,"
171,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,We sweeten’d every meal with social glee.
172,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The heart’s light laugh pursued the circling jest;
173,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And all was sunshine in each little breast.
174,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,’Twas here we chas’d the slipper by the sound;
175,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And turn’d the blindfold hero round and round.
176,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"’Twas here, at eve, we form’d our fairy ring;"
177,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And Fancy flutter’d on her wildest wing.
178,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Giants and genii chain’d each wondering ear;
179,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And orphan-sorrows drew the ready tear.
180,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Oft with the babes we wander’d in the wood,"
181,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Or view’d the forest-feats of Robin Hood:
182,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Oft, fancy-led, at midnight’s fearful hour,"
183,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,With startling step we seal’d the lonely tower:
184,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"O’er infant innocence to hang and weep,"
185,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Murder’d by ruffian hands, when smiling in its sleep."
186,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Ye Household Deities! whose guardian eye
187,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Mark’d each pure thought, ere register’d on high;"
188,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Still, still ye walk the consecrated ground,"
189,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And breathe the soul of Inspiration round.
190,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"As o’er the dusky furniture I bend,"
191,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Each chair awakes the feelings of a friend.
192,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The storied arras, source of fond delight,"
193,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,With old achievement charms the wilder’d sight;
194,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And still, with Heraldry’s rich hues imprest,"
195,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,On the dim window glows the pictur’d crest.
196,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The screen unfolds its many-colour’d chart.
197,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The clock still points its moral to the heart.
198,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,That faithful monitor ’twas heav’n to hear!
199,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,When soft it spoke a promis’d pleasure near:
200,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And has its sober hand, its simple chime,"
201,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Forgot to trace the feather’d feet of Time?
202,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"That massive beam, with curious carvings wrought,"
203,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Whence the caged linnet sooth’d my pensive thought;
204,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Those muskets, cas’d with venerable rust;"
205,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Those once-lov’d forms, still breathing thro’ their dust,"
206,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Still from the frame, in mould gigantic cast,"
207,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Starting to life—all whisper of the past!
208,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"As thro’ the garden’s desert paths I rove,"
209,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,What fond illusions swarm in every grove!
210,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"How oft, when purple evening ting’d the west,"
211,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,We watch’d the emmet to her grainy nest;
212,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Welcom’d the wild-bee home on weary wing,"
213,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Laden with sweets, the choicest of the spring!"
214,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"How oft inscrib’d, with ‘Friendship’s votive rhyme,"
215,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The bark now silver’d by the touch of Time;
216,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Soar’d in the swing, half pleas’d and half afraid,"
217,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Thro’ sister elms that wav’d their summer-shade;
218,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Or strew’d with crumbs yon root-inwoven seat,"
219,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,To lure the redbreast from his lone retreat!
220,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Childhood’s lov’d group revisits every scene;
221,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The tangled wood-walk, and the tufted green!"
222,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Indulgent MEMORY wakes, and lo, they live!"
223,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Cloth’d with far softer hues than Light can give.
224,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Thou first, best friend that Heav’n assigns below,"
225,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,To sooth and sweeten all the cares we know;
226,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Whose glad suggestions still each vain alarm,"
227,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When nature fades, and life forgets to charm;"
228,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Thee would the Muse invoke!—to thee belong
229,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The sage’s precept, and the poet’s song."
230,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"What soften’d views thy magic glass reveals,"
231,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,When o’er the landscape Time’s meek twilight steals!
232,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"As when in ocean sinks the orb of day,"
233,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Long on the wave reflected lustres play;
234,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Thy temper’d gleams of happiness resign’d
235,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Glance on the darken’d mirror of the mind.
236,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The School’s lone porch, with reverend mosses gray,"
237,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Just tells the pensive pilgrim where it lay.
238,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Mute is the bell that rung at peep of dawn,"
239,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Quickening my truant-feet across the lawn:
240,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Unheard the shout that rent the noontide air,"
241,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,When the slow dial gave a pause to care.
242,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Up springs, at every step, to claim a tear,[1]"
243,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Some little friendship form’d and cherish’d here!
244,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And not the lightest leaf, but trembling teems"
245,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"With golden visions, and romantic dreams!"
246,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Down by yon hazel copse, at evening, blaz’d"
247,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The Gipsy’s faggot—there we stood and gaz’d;
248,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Gaz’d on her sun-burnt face with silent awe,"
249,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Her tatter’d mantle, and her hood of straw;"
250,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Her moving lips, her caldron brimming o’er;"
251,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The drowsy brood that on her back she bore,"
252,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Imps, in the barn with mousing owlet bred,"
253,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,From rifled roost at nightly revel fed;
254,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Whose dark eyes flash’d thro’ locks of blackest shade,"
255,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,When in the breeze the distant watch-dog bay’d:—
256,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And heroes fled the Sibyl’s mutter’d call,"
257,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Whose elfin prowess scal’d the orchard-wall.
258,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"As o’er my palm the silver piece she drew,"
259,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And trac’d the line of life with searching view,"
260,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"How throbb’d my fluttering pulse with hopes and fears,"
261,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,To learn the colour of my future years!
262,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Ah, then, what honest triumph flush’d my breast!"
263,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,This truth once known—To bless is to be blest!
264,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"We led the bending beggar on his way,"
265,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"(Bare were his feet, his tresses silver-gray)"
266,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Sooth’d the keen pangs his aged spirit felt,"
267,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And on his tale with mute attention dwelt.
268,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"As in his scrip we dropt our little store,"
269,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And wept to think that little was no more,"
270,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"He breath’d his prayer, “Long may such goodness live!”"
271,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"’Twas all he gave, ’twas all he had to give."
272,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Angels, when Mercy’s mandate wing’d their flight,"
273,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Had stopt to catch new rapture from the sight.
274,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"But hark! thro’ those old firs, with sullen swell"
275,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The church-clock strikes! ye tender scenes, farewell!"
276,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"It calls me hence, beneath their shade, to trace"
277,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The few fond lines that Time may soon efface.
278,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"On yon gray stone, that fronts the chancel-door."
279,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Worn smooth by busy feet now seen no more,"
280,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Each eve we shot the marble thro’ the ring,"
281,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When the heart danc’d, and life was in its spring;"
282,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Alas! unconscious of the kindred earth,"
283,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,That faintly echoed to the voice of mirth.
284,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The glow-worm loves her emerald light to shed,"
285,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Where now the sexton rests his hoary head.
286,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Oft, as he turn’d the greensward with his spade,"
287,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,He lectur’d every youth that round him play’d;
288,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And, calmly pointing where his fathers lay,"
289,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Rous’d him to rival each, the hero of his day."
290,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Hush, ye fond flutterings, hush! while here alone"
291,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,I search the records of each mouldering stone.
292,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Guides of my life! Instructors of my youth!
293,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Who first unveil’d the hallow’d form of Truth;
294,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Whose every word enlighten’d and endear’d;
295,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"In age belov’d, in poverty rever’d;"
296,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"In Friendship’s silent register ye live,"
297,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Nor ask the vain memorial Art can give.
298,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"—But when the sons of peace and pleasure sleep,"
299,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When only Sorrow wakes, and wakes to weep,"
300,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"What spells entrance my visionary mind,"
301,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"With sighs so sweet, with transports so refin’d?"
302,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Ethereal Power! whose smile, at noon of night,"
303,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Recalls the far-fled spirit of delight;
304,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Instils that musing, melancholy mood,"
305,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Which charms the wise, and elevates the good;"
306,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Blest MEMORY, hail! Oh grant the grateful Muse,"
307,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Her pencil dipt in Nature’s living hues,"
308,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"To pass the clouds that round thy empire roll,"
309,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And trace its airy precincts in the soul.
310,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Lull’d in the countless chambers of the brain,"
311,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Our thoughts are link’d by many a hidden chain.
312,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Awake but one, and lo, what myriads rise![2]"
313,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Each stamps its image as the other flies!
314,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Each, as the various avenues of sense"
315,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Delight or sorrow to the soul dispense,"
316,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Brightens or fades; yet all, with magic art,"
317,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Controul the latent fibres of the heart.
318,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,As studious PROSPERO’S mysterious spell
319,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Conven’d the subject-spirits to his cell;
320,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Each, at thy call, advances or retires,"
321,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"As judgment dictates, or the scene inspires."
322,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Each thrills the seat of sense, that sacred source"
323,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Whence the fine nerves direct their mazy course,"
324,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And thro’ the frame invisibly convey
325,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The subtle, quick vibrations as they play."
326,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Survey the globe, each ruder realm explore;"
327,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"From Reason’s faintest ray to NEWTON soar,"
328,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,What different spheres to human bliss assign’d!
329,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,What slow gradations in the scale of mind!
330,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Yet mark in each these mystic wonders wrought;
331,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Oh mark the sleepless energies of thought!
332,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The adventurous boy, that asks his little share,"
333,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And hies from home with many a gossip’s prayer,"
334,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Turns on the neighbouring hill, once more to see"
335,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The dear abode of peace and privacy;
336,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And as he turns, the thatch among the trees,"
337,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The smoke’s blue wreaths ascending with the breeze,"
338,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The village-common spotted white with sheep,"
339,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The church-yard yews round which his fathers sleep;[3]
340,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,All rouse Reflection’s sadly-pleasing train.
341,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And oft he looks and weeps, and looks again."
342,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"So, when the mild TUPIA dar’d explore"
343,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Arts yet untaught, and worlds unknown before,"
344,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And, with the sons of Science, woo’d the gale"
345,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"That, rising, swell’d their strange expanse of sail;"
346,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"So, when he breath’d his firm yet fond adieu,[4]"
347,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Borne from his leafy hut, his carv’d canoe,"
348,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And all his soul best lov’d—such tears he shed,"
349,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,While each soft scene of summer-beauty fled:
350,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Long o’er the wave a wistful look he cast,"
351,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Long watch’d the streaming signal from the mast;
352,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Till twilight’s dewy tints deceiv’d his eye,"
353,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And fairy forests fring’d the evening sky.
354,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"So Scotia’s Queen, as slowly dawn’d the day,’[5]"
355,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Rose on her couch, and gaz’d her soul away."
356,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Her eyes had bless’d the beacon’s glimmering height,"
357,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,That faintly tipt the feathery surge with light;
358,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,But now the morn with orient hues pourtray’d
359,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Each castled cliff, and brown monastic shade:"
360,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"All touch’d the talisman’s resistless spring,"
361,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And lo, what busy tribes were instant on the wing!"
362,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Thus kindred objects kindred thoughts inspire,[6]"
363,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,As summer-clouds flash forth electric fire.
364,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And hence this spot gives back the joys of youth,"
365,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Warm as the life, and with the mirror’s truth."
366,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Hence home-felt pleasure prompts the Patriot’s sigh;[7]
367,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"This makes him wish to live, and dare to die."
368,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"For this young FOSCARI, whose hapless fate[8]"
369,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Venice should blush to hear the Muse relate,"
370,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When exile wore his blooming years away,"
371,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"To sorrow’s long soliloquies a prey,"
372,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When reason, justice, vainly urg’d his cause,"
373,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,For this he rous’d her sanguinary laws;
374,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Glad to return, tho’ Hope could grant no more,"
375,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And chains and torture hail’d him to the shore.
376,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And hence the charm historic scenes impart:
377,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Hence Tiber awes, and Avon melts the heart."
378,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Aerial forms, in Tempe’s classic vale,"
379,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Glance thro’ the gloom, and whisper in the gale;"
380,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"In wild Vaucluse with love and LAURA dwell,"

387,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The immortal Sage of Syracuse repos’d.
388,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And as his youth in sweet delusion hung,"

392,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"In Rome’s great forum, who but hears him roll"
393,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,His moral thunders o’er the subject soul?
394,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And hence that calm delight the portrait gives:
395,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,We gaze on every feature till it lives!
396,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Still the fond lover views the absent maid;
397,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And the lost friend still lingers in his shade!
398,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Say why the pensive widow loves to weep,[12]"
399,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,When on her knee she rocks her babe to sleep:
400,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Tremblingly still, she lifts his veil to trace"
401,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The father’s features in his infant face.
402,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The hoary grandsire smiles the hour away,"

409,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Each gentler, finer impulse of the breast;"
410,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Still shall this active principle preside,"

412,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The intrepid Swiss, that guards a foreign shore,"
413,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Condemn’d to climb his mountain-cliffs no more,"
414,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,If chance he hears the song so sweetly wild[13]
415,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Which on those cliffs his infant hours beguil’d,"
416,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Melts at the long-lost scenes that round him rise,"
417,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And sinks a martyr to repentant sighs.
418,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Ask not if courts or camps dissolve the charm:

432,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Undamp’d by time, the generous Instinct glows"
433,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Far as Angola’s sands, as Zembla’s snows;"
434,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Glows in the tiger’s den, the serpent’s nest,"
435,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,On every form of varied life imprest.
436,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The social tribes its choicest influence hail:—
437,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And, when the drum beats briskly in the gale,"
438,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The war-worn courser charges at the sound,"
439,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And with young vigour wheels the pasture round.
440,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Oft has the aged tenant of the vale

443,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,From sire to son with pious zeal bequeath’d.
444,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When o’er the blasted heath the day declin’d,"
445,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And on the scath’d oak warr’d the winter-wind;
446,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,When not a distant taper’s twinkling ray
447,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Gleam’d o’er the furze to light him on his way;
448,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When not a sheep-bell sooth’d his listening ear,"
449,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And the big rain-drops told the tempest near;
450,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Then did his horse the homeward track descry,[18]"
451,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The track that shunn’d his sad, inquiring eye;"
452,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And win each wavering purpose to relent,"
453,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"With warmth so mild, so gently violent,"
454,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"That his charm’d hand the careless rein resign’d,"
455,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And doubts and terrors vanish’d from his mind.
456,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Recall the traveller, whose alter’d form"
457,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Has borne the buffet of the mountain-storm;
458,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And who will first his fond impatience meet?

676,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The good and fair her faultless line pourtrays;
677,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Whose mind, prophan’d by no unhallow’d guest,"
678,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Culls from the crowd the purest and the best;
679,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"May range, at will, bright Fancy’s golden clime,"
680,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Or, musing, mount where Science sits sublime,"
681,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Or wake the spirit of departed Time.
682,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Who acts thus wisely, mark the moral muse,"
683,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,A blooming Eden in his life reviews!
684,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"So rich the culture, tho’ so small the space,"
685,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Its scanty limits he forgets to trace.
686,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"But the fond fool, when evening shades the sky,"
687,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Turns but to start, and gazes but to sigh![23]"
688,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The weary waste, that lengthen’d as he ran,"
689,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Fades to a blank, and dwindles to a span!"
690,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Ah! who can tell the triumphs of the mind,"
691,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"By truth illumin’d, and by taste refin’d?"
692,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When Age has quench’d the eye and clos’d the ear,"
693,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Still nerv’d for action in her native sphere,"
694,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Oft will she rise—with searching glance pursue
695,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Some long-lov’d image vanish’d from her view;
696,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Dart thro’ the deep recesses of the past,"
697,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,O’er dusky forms in chains of slumber cast;
698,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"With giant-grasp fling back the folds of night,"
699,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And snatch the faithless fugitive to light.
700,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,So thro’ the grove the impatient mother flies.
701,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Each sunless glade, each secret pathway tries;"
702,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Till the light leaves the truant boy disclose,"
703,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Long on the wood-moss stretch’d in sweet repose.
704,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Nor yet to pleasing objects are confin’d
705,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The silent feasts of the reflecting mind.
706,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Danger and death a dread delight inspire;
707,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And the bald veteran glows with wonted fire,"
708,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When, richly bronz’d by many a summer-sun,"
709,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"He counts his scars, and tells what deeds were done."
710,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Go, with old Thames, view Chelsea’s glorious pile;"
711,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And ask the shatter’d hero, whence his smile?"
712,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Go, view the splendid domes of Greenwich—Go,"
713,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And own what raptures from Reflection flow.
714,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Hail, noblest structures imag’d in the wave!"
715,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,A nation’s grateful tribute to the brave.
716,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Hail, blest retreats from war and shipwreck, hail!"
717,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,That oft arrest the wondering stranger’s sail.
718,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Long have ye heard the narratives of age,"
719,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The battle’s havoc, and the tempest’s rage;"
720,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Long have ye known Reflection’s genial ray
721,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Gild the calm close of Valour’s various day.
722,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Time’s sombrous touches soon correct the piece,"
723,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Mellow each tint, and bid each discord cease:"
724,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"A softer tone of light pervades the whole,"
725,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And steals a pensive languor o’er the soul.
726,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Hast thou thro’ Eden’s wild-wood vales pursued[24]
727,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Each mountain-scene, majestically rude;"
728,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"To note the sweet simplicity of life,"
729,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Far from the din of Folly’s idle strife:
730,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Nor there awhile, with lifted eye, rever’d"
731,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,That modest stone which pious PEMBROKE rear’d;
732,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Which still records, beyond the pencil’s power,"
733,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The silent sorrows of a parting hour;
734,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Still to the musing pilgrim points the place,"
735,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Her sainted spirit most delights to trace?
736,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Thus, with the manly glow of honest pride,"
737,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,O’er his dead son the gallant ORMOND sigh’d.[25]
738,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Thus, thro’ the gloom of SHENSTONE’S fairy grove,"
739,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,MARIA’S urn still breathes the voice of love.
740,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,As the stern grandeur of a Gothic tower
741,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Awes us less deeply in its morning hour,"
742,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Than when the shades of Time serenely fall
743,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,On every broken arch and ivy’d wall;
744,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The tender images we love to trace,"
745,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Steal from each year a melancholy grace!
746,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And as the sparks of social love expand,"
747,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,As the heart opens in a foreign land;
748,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And, with a brother’s warmth, a brother’s smile,"
749,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The stranger greets each native of his isle;
750,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"So scenes of life, when present and confest,"
751,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Stamp but their bolder features on the breast;
752,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Yet not an image, when remotely view’d,"
753,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"However trivial, and however rude,"
754,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"But wins the heart, and wakes the social sigh,"
755,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,With every claim of close affinity!
756,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,But these pure joys the world can never know;
757,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,In gentler climes their silver currents flow.
758,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Oft at the silent, shadowy close of day,"
759,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,When the hush’d grove has sung its parting lay;
760,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When pensive Twilight, in her dusky car,"
761,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Comes slowly on to meet the evening-star;
762,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Above, below, aerial murmurs swell,"
763,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"From hanging wood, brown heath, and bushy dell!"
764,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"A thousand nameless rills, that shun the light."
765,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Stealing soft music on the ear of night.
766,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"So oft the finer movements of the soul,"
767,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"That shun the sphere of Pleasure’s gay controul,"
768,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"In the still shades of calm Seclusion rise,"
769,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And breathe their sweet, seraphic harmonies!"
770,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,
771,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Once, and domestic annals tell the time,"
772,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"(Preserv’d in Cumbria’s rude, romantic clime)"
773,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When nature smil’d, and o’er the landscape threw"
774,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Her richest fragrance, and her brightest hue,"
775,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,A blithe and blooming Forester explor’d
776,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Those loftier scenes SALVATOR’S soul ador’d;
777,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The rocky pass half hung with shaggy wood,"
778,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And the cleft oak flung boldly o’er the flood;
779,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Nor shunn’d the path, unknown to human tread,"
780,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,That downward to the night of caverns led;
781,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Some antient cataract’s deserted bed.
782,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"High on exulting wing the heath-cock rose,[26]"
783,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And blew his shrill blast o’er perennial snows
784,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Ere the rapt youth, recoiling from the roar,"
785,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Gaz’d on the tumbling tide of dread Lodoar;
786,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And thro’ the rifted cliffs, that scal’d the sky,"
787,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Derwent’s clear mirror charm’d his dazzled eye.[27]
788,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Each osier isle, inverted on the wave,"
789,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Thro’ morn’s gray mist its melting colours gave;
790,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And, o’er the cygnet’s haunt, the mantling grove"
791,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Its emerald arch with wild luxuriance wove.
792,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Light as the breeze that brush’d the orient dew:
793,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,From rock to rock the young adventurer flew;
794,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And day’s last sunshine slept along the shore,"
795,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When lo, a path the smile of welcome wore."
796,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Imbowering shrubs with verdure veil’d the sky,"
797,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And on the musk-rose shed a deeper dye;
798,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Save when a bright and momentary gleam
799,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Glanc’d from the white foam of some shelter’d stream.
800,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"O’er the still lake the bell of evening toll’d,"
801,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And on the moor the shepherd penn’d his fold;
802,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And on the green hill’s side the meteor play’d;
803,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When, hark! a voice sung sweetly thro’ the shade."
804,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"It ceas’d—yet still in FLORIO’S fancy sung,"
805,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Still on each note his captive spirit hung;
806,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Till o’er the mead a cool, sequester’d grot"
807,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,From its rich roof a sparry lustre shot.
808,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"A crystal water cross’d the pebbled floor,"
809,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And on the front these simple lines it bore:
810,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,
811,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Hence away, nor dare intrude!"
812,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"In this secret, shadowy cell"
813,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Musing MEMORY loves to dwell,"
814,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,With her sister Solitude.
815,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,
816,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Far from the busy world she flies,"
817,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,To taste that peace the world denies.
818,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Entranc’d she sits; from youth to age,"
819,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Reviewing Life’s eventful page;
820,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And noting, ere they fade away,"
821,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The little lines of yesterday.
822,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,
823,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"FLORIO had gain’d a rude and rocky seat,"
824,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When lo, the Genius of this still retreat!"
825,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Fair was her form—but who can hope to trace
826,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The pensive softness of her angel-face?
827,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Can VIRGIL’S verse, can RAPHAEL’S touch impart"
828,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Those finer features of the feeling heart,"
829,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Those tend’rer tints that shun the careless eye,"
830,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And in the world’s contagious climate die?
831,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"She left the cave, nor mark’d the stranger there;"
832,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Her pastoral beauty, and her artless air"
833,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Had breath’d a soft enchantment o’er his soul!
834,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,In every nerve he felt her blest controul!
835,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"What pure and white-wing’d agents of the sky,"
836,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Who rule the springs of sacred sympathy,"
837,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Inform congenial spirits when they meet?
838,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Sweet is their office, as their natures sweet!"
839,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"FLORIO, with fearful joy, pursued the maid,"
840,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Till thro’ a vista’s moonlight-checquer’d shade,"
841,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Where the bat circled, and the rooks repos’d,"
842,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"(Their wars suspended, and their councils clos’d)"
843,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"An antique mansion burst in awful state,"
844,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,A rich vine clustering round the Gothic gate.
845,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Nor paus’d he there. The master of the scene
846,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Saw his light step imprint the dewy green;
847,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And, slow-advancing, hail’d him as his guest,"
848,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Won by the honest warmth his looks express’d,"
849,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,He wore the rustic manners of a ’Squire;
850,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Age had not quench’d one spark of manly fire;
851,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"But giant Gout had bound him in her chain,"
852,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And his heart panted for the chase in vain.
853,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Yet here Remembrance, sweetly-soothing power!"
854,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Wing’d with delight Confinement’s lingering hour.
855,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The fox’s brush still emulous to wear,"
856,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,He scour’d the county in his elbow-chair;
857,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And, with view-halloo, rous’d the dreaming hound,"
858,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"That rung, by starts, his deep-ton’d music round."
859,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Long by the paddock’s humble pale confin’d,"
860,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,His aged hunters cours’d the viewless wind:
861,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And each, with glowing energy pourtray’d,"
862,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The far-fam’d triumphs of the field display’d:
863,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Usurp’d the canvas of the crowded hall,"
864,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And chas’d a line of heroes from the wall.
865,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,There slept the horn each jocund echo knew.
866,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And many a smile and many a story drew!
867,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"High o’er the hearth his forest-trophies hung,"
868,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And their fantastic branches wildly flung.
869,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,How would he dwell on the vast antlers there!
870,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"These dash’d the wave, those fann’d the mountain-air."
871,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"All, as they frown’d, unwritten records bore,"
872,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Of gallant feats and festivals of yore.
873,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,
874,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"But why the tale prolong?—His only child,"
875,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,His darling JULIA on the stranger smil’d.
876,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Her little arts a fretful sire to please,"
877,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Her gentle gaiety, and native ease"
878,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Had won his soul; and rapturous Fancy shed
879,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Her golden lights, and tints of rosy red."
880,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"But ah! few days had pass’d, ere the bright vision fled!"
881,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When evening ting’d the lake’s ethereal blue,"
882,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And her deep shades irregularly threw;
883,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Their shifting sail dropt gently from the cove,"
884,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Down by St. Herbert’s consecrated grove;[28]
885,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Whence erst the chanted hymn, the taper’d rite"
886,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Amus’d the fisher’s solitary night:
887,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And still the mitred window, richly wreath’d,"
888,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,A sacred calm thro’ the brown foliage breath’d.
889,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The wild deer, starting thro’ the silent glade,"
890,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,With fearful gaze their various course survey’d.
891,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"High hung in air the hoary goat reclin’d,"
892,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,His streaming beard the sport of every wind;
893,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And, while the coot her jet-wing lov’d to lave,"
894,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Rock’d on the bosom of the sleepless wave;
895,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The eagle rush’d from Skiddaw’s purple crest,"
896,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,A cloud still brooding o’er her giant-nest.
897,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And now the moon had dimm’d, with dewy ray."
898,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The few fine flushes of departing day;
899,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"O’er the wide water’s deep serene she hung,"
900,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And her broad lights on every mountain flung;
901,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When lo! a sudden blast the vessel blew,[29]"
902,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And to the surge consign’d the little crew.
903,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"All, all escap’d—but ere the lover bore"
904,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"His faint and faded JULIA, to the shore,"
905,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Her sense had fled!—Exhausted by the storm,"
906,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,A fatal trance hang o’er her pallid form;
907,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Her closing eye a trembling lustre fir’d;
908,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,’Twas life’s last spark—it flutter’d and expir’d!
909,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The father strew’d his white hairs in the wind,"
910,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Call’d on his child—nor linger’d long behind:
911,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And FLORIO liv’d to see the willow wave,"
912,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"With many an evening-whisper, o’er their grave."
913,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Yes, FLORIO liv’d—and, still of each possest,"
914,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The father cherish’d, and the maid caress’d!"
915,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"For ever would the fond enthusiast rove,"
916,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"With JULIA’S spirit, thro’ the shadowy grove;"
917,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Gaze with delight on every scene she plann’d,"
918,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Kiss every flowret planted by her hand.
919,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Ah! still he trac’d her steps along the glade,"
920,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,When hazy hues and glimmering lights betray’d
921,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Half-viewless forms; still listen’d as the breeze
922,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Heav’d its deep sobs among the aged trees;
923,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And at each pause her melting accents caught,"
924,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,In sweet delirium of romantic thought!
925,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Dear was the grot that shunn’d the blaze of day;
926,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,She gave its spars to shoot a trembling ray.
927,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The spring, that bubbled from its inmost cell,"
928,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Murmur’d of JULIA’S virtues as it fell;
929,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And o’er the dripping moss, the fretted stone,"
930,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,In FLORIO’S ear breath’d language not its own.
931,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Her charm around the enchantress MEMORY threw,"
932,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"A charm that sooths the mind, and sweetens too!"
933,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,But is Her magic only felt below?
934,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Say, thro’ what brighter realms she bids it flow;"
935,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"To what pure beings, in a nobler sphere,[30]"
936,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,She yields delight but faintly imag’d here:
937,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"All that till now their rapt researches knew,"
938,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Not call’d in slow succession to review;
939,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"But, as a landscape meets the eye of day,"
940,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,At once presented to their glad survey!
941,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Each scene of bliss reveal’d, since chaos fled,"
942,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And dawning light its dazzling glories spread;
943,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Each chain of wonders that sublimely glow’d,"
944,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Since first Creation’s choral anthem flow’d;
945,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Each ready flight, at Mercy’s smile divine,"
946,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,To distant worlds that undiscover’d shine;
947,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Full on her tablet flings its living rays,"
948,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And all, combin’d, with blest effulgence blaze."
949,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"There thy bright train, immortal Friendship, soar;"
950,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"No more to part, to mingle tears no more!"
951,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And, as the softening hand of Time endears"
952,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The joys and sorrows of our infant-years,"
953,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"So there the soul, releas’d from human strife,"
954,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Smiles at the little cares and ills of life;
955,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Its lights and shades, its sunshine and its showers;"
956,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,As at a dream that charm’d her vacant hours!
957,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Oft may the spirits of the dead descend
958,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,To watch the silent slumbers of a friend;
959,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"To hover round his evening-walk unseen,"
960,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And hold sweet converse on the dusky green;
961,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"To hail the spot where first their friendship grew,"
962,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And heav’n and nature open’d to their view!
963,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Oft, when he trims his cheerful hearth, and sees"
964,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,A smiling circle emulous to please;
965,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"There may these gentle guests delight to dwell,"
966,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And bless the scene they lov’d in life so well!
967,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Oh thou! with whom my heart was wont to share
968,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,From Reason’s dawn each pleasure and each care;
969,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"With whom, alas! I fondly hop’d to know"
970,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The humble walks of happiness below;
971,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,If thy blest nature now unites above
972,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"An angel’s pity with a brother’s love,"
973,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Still o’er my life preserve thy mild controul,"
974,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Correct my views, and elevate my soul;"
975,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Grant me thy peace and purity of mind,"
976,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Devout yet cheerful, active yet resign’d;"
977,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Grant me, like thee, whose heart knew no disguise,"
978,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Whose blameless wishes never aim’d to rise,"
979,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"To meet the changes Time and Chance present,"
980,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,With modest dignity and calm content.
981,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When thy last breath, ere Nature sunk to rest,"
982,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Thy meek submission to thy God express’d;
983,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"When thy last look, ere thought and feeling fled,"
984,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,A mingled gleam of hope and triumph shed;
985,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"What to thy soul its glad assurance gave,"
986,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Its hope in death, its triumph o’er the grave?"
987,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"The sweet Remembrance of unblemish’d youth,"
988,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The still inspiring voice of Innocence and Truth!
989,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Hail, MEMORY, hail! in thy exhaustless mine"
990,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,From age to age unnumber’d treasures shine!
991,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Thought and her shadowy brood thy call obey,"
992,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,And Place and Time are subject to thy sway!
993,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Thy pleasures most we feel, when most alone;"
994,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,The only pleasures we can call our own.
995,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Lighter than air, Hope’s summer-visions die,"
996,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,If but a fleeting cloud obscure the sky;
997,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"If but a beam of sober Reason play,"
998,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Lo, Fancy’s fairy frost-work melts away!"
999,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"But can the wiles of Art, the grasp of Power,"
1000,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Snatch the rich relics of a well-spent hour?
1001,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"These, when the trembling spirit wings her flight,"
1002,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,Pour round her path a stream of living light;
1003,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"And gild those pure and perfect realms of rest,"
1004,THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,"Where Virtue triumphs, and her sons are blest!"

1363,PREFACE.,"in præsentia, sed etiam postero die jucundæ sunt.’ But when we look"
1364,PREFACE.,"round as we sit there, we find ourselves in a Sabine farm, and not in"
1365,PREFACE.,a Roman villa. His windows have every charm of prospect; but his
1366,PREFACE.,"furniture might have descended from Cincin-natus; and gems, and"
1367,PREFACE.,"pictures, and old marbles, are mentioned by him more than once with a"
1368,PREFACE.,seeming indifference.
1369,PREFACE.,
1370,PREFACE.,"His English Imitator thought and felt, perhaps, more correctly on the"
1371,PREFACE.,subject; and embellished his garden and grotto with great industry
1372,PREFACE.,and success. But to these alone he solicits our notice. On the
1373,PREFACE.,ornaments of his house he is silent; and he appears to have reserved
1374,PREFACE.,"all the minuter touches of his pencil for the library, the chapel,"
1375,PREFACE.,"and the banquetting-room of Timon. ‘Le savoir de notre siècle,’ says"
1376,PREFACE.,"Rousseau, ‘tend beaucoup plus à détruire qu’à edifier. On censure"
1377,PREFACE.,"d’un ton de maitre; pour proposer, il en faut prendre un autre.’"
1378,PREFACE.,
1379,PREFACE.,It is the design of this Epistle to illustrate the virtue of True
1380,PREFACE.,"Taste; and to shew how little she requires to secure, not only the"
1381,PREFACE.,"comforts, but even the elegancies of life. True Taste is an excellent"
1382,PREFACE.,"Economist. She confines her choice to few objects, and delights in"
1383,PREFACE.,producing great effects by small means: while False Taste is for ever
1384,PREFACE.,"sighing after the new and the rare; and reminds us, in her works, of"
1385,PREFACE.,"the Scholar of Apelles, who, not being able to paint his Helen"
1386,PREFACE.,"beautiful, determined to make her fine."

1404,ARGUMENT.,"In vain, alas, a village-friend invites"

1409,ARGUMENT.,"Its hives of sweets, and cabinets of art;"
1410,ARGUMENT.,"And, lo, majestic as thy manly song,"
1411,ARGUMENT.,Flows the full tide of human life along.
1412,ARGUMENT.,Still must my partial pencil love to dwell
1413,ARGUMENT.,On the home-prospects of my hermit cell;
1414,ARGUMENT.,"The mossy pales that skirt the orchard-green,"
1415,ARGUMENT.,"Here hid by shrub-wood, there by glimpses seen;"
1416,ARGUMENT.,"And the brown pathway, that, with careless flow,"
1417,ARGUMENT.,"Sinks, and is lost among the trees below."
1418,ARGUMENT.,Still must it trace (the flattering tints forgive)
1419,ARGUMENT.,Each fleeting charm that bids the landscape live.
1420,ARGUMENT.,"Oft o’er the mead, at pleasing distance, pass[a]"
1421,ARGUMENT.,Browsing the hedge by fits the pannier’d ass;
1422,ARGUMENT.,"The idling shepherd-boy, with rude delight,"
1423,ARGUMENT.,Whistling his dog to mark the pebble’s flight;
1424,ARGUMENT.,"And in her kerchief blue the cottage-maid,"
1425,ARGUMENT.,With brimming pitcher from the shadowy glade.
1426,ARGUMENT.,"Far to the south a mountain-vale retires,"
1427,ARGUMENT.,"Rich in its groves, and glens, and village-spires;"

1436,ARGUMENT.,"Ah, still as soon the young Aurora plays,"
1437,ARGUMENT.,Tho’ moons and flambeaux trail their broadest blaze;

1439,ARGUMENT.,Tho’ Evening lingers at the mask so long.
1440,ARGUMENT.,"There let her strike with momentary ray,"
1441,ARGUMENT.,As tapers shine their little lives away;
1442,ARGUMENT.,"There let her practise from herself to steal,"
1443,ARGUMENT.,And look the happiness she does not feel;
1444,ARGUMENT.,The ready smile and bidden blush employ
1445,ARGUMENT.,At Faro-routs that dazzle to destroy;
1446,ARGUMENT.,"Fan with affected ease the essenc’d air,"
1447,ARGUMENT.,And lisp of fashions with unmeaning stare.
1448,ARGUMENT.,"Be thine to meditate an humbler flight,"
1449,ARGUMENT.,When morning fills the fields with rosy light;

1452,ARGUMENT.,"Here no state-chambers in long line unfold,"
1453,ARGUMENT.,"Bright with broad mirrors, rough with fretted gold;"

1498,ARGUMENT.,"Emblem of Life! which, still as we survey,"
1499,ARGUMENT.,"Seems motionless, yet ever glides away!"
1500,ARGUMENT.,"The shadowy walls record, with Attic art,"

1502,ARGUMENT.,"Here THETIS, bending, with a mother’s fears"
1503,ARGUMENT.,"Dips her dear boy, whose pride restrains his tears."
1504,ARGUMENT.,"There, VENUS, rising, shrinks with sweet surprize,"
1505,ARGUMENT.,As her fair self reflected seems to rise!
1506,ARGUMENT.,"Far from the joyless glare, the maddening strife,"
1507,ARGUMENT.,"And all ‘the dull impertinence of life,’"
1508,ARGUMENT.,"These eyelids open to the rising ray,"
1509,ARGUMENT.,"And close, when Nature bids, at close of day."

1535,ARGUMENT.,The cheap amusements of a mind at ease;
1536,ARGUMENT.,"Here every care in sweet oblivion cast,"
1537,ARGUMENT.,And many an idle hour—not idly pass’d.
1538,ARGUMENT.,"No tuneful echoes, ambush’d at my gate,"
1539,ARGUMENT.,Catch the blest accents of the wise and great.[k]

1573,ARGUMENT.,"Dares, with rude sound, the cheerful rite restrain;"
1574,ARGUMENT.,"And, while the frugal banquet glows reveal’d,"

1576,ARGUMENT.,"While blushing fruits thro’ scatter’d leaves invite,"
1577,ARGUMENT.,"Still clad in bloom, and veil’d in azure light;—"
1578,ARGUMENT.,"With wine, as rich in years as HORACE sings,"

1591,ARGUMENT.,That scent the vineyard in its purple hours.
1592,ARGUMENT.,"Rise, ere the watch-relieving clarions play,"

3060,PREFACE.,has here and there a lyrical turn of thought and expression. It is sudden in
3061,PREFACE.,"its transitions, and full of historical allusions; leaving much to be imagined"
3062,PREFACE.,by the reader.
3063,PREFACE.,
3064,PREFACE.,[1]
3065,PREFACE.,"The Original in the Castilian language, according to the Inscription that"
3066,PREFACE.,"fellows, was found among other MSS. in an old religious house near Palos,"
3067,PREFACE.,"situated on an island formed by the river Tinto, and dedicated to our Lady of"
3068,PREFACE.,Rábida. The Writer describes himself as having sailed with Columbus; but his
3069,PREFACE.,style and manner are evidently of an after-time.
3070,PREFACE.,
3071,PREFACE.,The subject is a voyage the most memorable in the annals of mankind.
3072,PREFACE.,"Columbus was a person of extraordinary virtue and piety, acting under"
3073,PREFACE.,the sense of a divine impulse; and his achievement the discovery of a
3074,PREFACE.,"New World, the inhabitants of which were shut out from the light of"
3075,PREFACE.,"Revelation, and given up, as they believed, to the dominion of"
3076,PREFACE.,malignant spirits.
3077,PREFACE.,
3078,PREFACE.,Many of the incidents will now be thought extravagant; yet they were
3079,PREFACE.,once perhaps received with something more than indulgence. It was an
3080,PREFACE.,age of miracles; and who can say that among the venerable legends in
3081,PREFACE.,"the library of the Escurial, or the more authentic records which"
3082,PREFACE.,"fill the great chamber in the _Archivo_ of Simancas, and which relate"
3083,PREFACE.,"entirely to the deep tragedy of America, there are no volumes that"
3084,PREFACE.,"mention the marvellous things here described? Indeed the story, as"
3085,PREFACE.,"already told throughout Europe, admits of no heightening. Such was"
3086,PREFACE.,"the religious enthusiasm of the early writers, that the Author had"
3087,PREFACE.,only to transfuse it into his verse; and he appears to have done
3088,PREFACE.,"little more; though some of the circumstances, which he alludes to as"
3089,PREFACE.,"well-known, have long ceased to be so. By using the language of that"
3090,PREFACE.,"day, he has called up Columbus ‘in his habit as he lived;’ and the"
3091,PREFACE.,"authorities, such as exist, are carefully given by the translator."

4747,LAS CASAS.,"family-festival. Garcilasso de la Vega relates how his dear father,"
4748,LAS CASAS.,"the valorous Andres, collected together in his chamber seven or eight"
4749,LAS CASAS.,"gentlemen to share with him three asparaguses, the first that ever"
4750,LAS CASAS.,grew on the table-land of Cusco. When the operation of dressing them
4751,LAS CASAS.,was over (and it is minutely described) he distributed the two
4752,LAS CASAS.,largest among his friends; begging that the company would not take it
4753,LAS CASAS.,"ill, if he reserved the third for himself, _as it was a thing from"
4754,LAS CASAS.,Spain_.
4755,LAS CASAS.,North America became instantly an asylum for the oppressed;
4756,LAS CASAS.,"huguenots, and catholics, and sects of every name and country. Such"
4757,LAS CASAS.,"were the first settlers in Carolina and Maryland, Pennsylvania and"
4758,LAS CASAS.,New England. Nor is South America altogether without a claim to the
4759,LAS CASAS.,"title. Even now, while I am writing, the antient house of Braganza is"

4769,LAS CASAS.,"libres, François, s’embrassant comme des frères, et bénissant le règne de"
4770,LAS CASAS.,"la liberté, qui doit amener partout une harmonic universelle.—Mais les"
4771,LAS CASAS.,"mines, les esclaves, que deviendront-ils? Les mines se fermerout; les esclaves"
