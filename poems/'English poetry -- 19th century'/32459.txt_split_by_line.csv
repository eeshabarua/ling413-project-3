514,F.],"""sprang from the next village"" might not be intended to mean that he was"
515,F.],"born there; or, if it did, the fact that Wordsworth's mother was a"

2957,VARIANTS:,In few instances is it more evident that the dates which Wordsworth
2958,VARIANTS:,"affixed to his poems, in the editions of 1815, 1820, 1836, and"
2959,VARIANTS:,"1845,--and those assigned in the Fenwick notes--cannot be absolutely"
2960,VARIANTS:,"relied upon, than in the case of the poems referring to Coleorton."
2961,VARIANTS:,"Trusting to these dates, in the absence of contrary evidence, one would"
2962,VARIANTS:,naturally assign the majority of the Coleorton poems to the year 1808.
2963,VARIANTS:,"But it is clear that, while the sonnet _To Lady Beaumont_ may have been"

2970,VARIANTS:,"and that the other ""Inscription"" designed for a Niche in the"
2971,VARIANTS:,"Winter-garden at Coleorton, belongs (I think) to the same year; a year"

2977,VARIANTS:,"When the dates are so difficult to determine, there is a natural fitness"
2978,VARIANTS:,"in bringing all the poems referring to Coleorton together, so far as"
2979,VARIANTS:,this can be done without seriously interfering with chronological order.
2980,VARIANTS:,"The two ""Inscriptions"" intended for the Coleorton grounds, which were"
2981,VARIANTS:,"written at Grasmere in 1811, are therefore printed along with the poems"
2982,VARIANTS:,of 1807; the precise date of each being given--so far as it can be
2983,VARIANTS:,ascertained--underneath its title.
2984,VARIANTS:,
2985,VARIANTS:,"Several political sonnets, and others, were written in 1807; also the"
2986,VARIANTS:,"_Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle_, and the first and larger part of"
2987,VARIANTS:,"_The White Doe of Rylstone_, with a few minor fragments. But, for"
2988,VARIANTS:,reasons stated in the notes to _The White Doe of Rylstone_ (see p.
2989,VARIANTS:,"191), I have assigned that poem to the year 1808. The _Song at the Feast"
2990,VARIANTS:,"of Brougham Castle_ forms as natural a preface to _The White Doe_, as"
2991,VARIANTS:,"_The Force of Prayer, a Tradition of Bolton Abbey_, is its natural"
2992,VARIANTS:,"appendix. The latter was written, however, before _The White Doe of"
2993,VARIANTS:,Rylstone_ was finished.
2994,VARIANTS:,
2995,VARIANTS:,It would be easier to fix the date of some of the poems written between
2996,VARIANTS:,"the years 1806 and 1808, if we knew the exact month in which the two"

3002,VARIANTS:,"volume to the press"" (evidently referring to the ""Poems"" of 1807). On"
3003,VARIANTS:,the following day--11th November 1806--Dorothy Wordsworth wrote to Lady
3004,VARIANTS:,"Beaumont, ""William has written two other poems, which you will see when"
3005,VARIANTS:,they are printed. He composes frequently in the grove.... We have not
3006,VARIANTS:,"yet received a sheet from the printer."" On the 15th November 1806 she"
3007,VARIANTS:,"again wrote to Lady Beaumont (from Coleorton), ""My brother works very"
3008,VARIANTS:,"hard at his poems, preparing them for the press. Miss Hutchinson is the"
3009,VARIANTS:,"transcriber."" In a subsequent letter from Coleorton, undated, but"
3010,VARIANTS:,"bearing the post-mark February 18, 1807, she is speaking of her"
3011,VARIANTS:,"brother's poetical labour, and says, ""He must go on, when he begins: and"
3012,VARIANTS:,any interruptions (such as attending to the progress of the workmen and
3013,VARIANTS:,"planning the garden) are of the greatest use to him; for, after a"
3014,VARIANTS:,"certain time, the progress is by no means proportioned to the labour in"
3015,VARIANTS:,"composition; and if he is called from it by other thoughts, he returns"
3016,VARIANTS:,"to it with ten times the pleasure, and the work goes on proportionately"
3017,VARIANTS:,"the more rapidly."" From this we may infer that the years 1806-7 were"
3018,VARIANTS:,"productive ones, but it is disappointing that the dates of the"

3059,TO LADY BEAUMONT,"""perennial bowers and murmuring pines"" may still be seen, little altered"
3060,TO LADY BEAUMONT,since 1807. The late Sir George Beaumont (whose grandfather was
3061,TO LADY BEAUMONT,"first-cousin to the artist Sir George, Wordsworth's friend), with strong"
3062,TO LADY BEAUMONT,"reverence for the past, and for the traditions of literary men which"

3064,TO LADY BEAUMONT,"the dramatist, and especially for the memorials of Wordsworth's ten"

3066,TO LADY BEAUMONT,"memorials, very much as they were when he entered in possession of the"
3067,TO LADY BEAUMONT,estates of his ancestors. Such a reverence for the past is not only
3068,TO LADY BEAUMONT,"consistent with the ""improvement"" of an estate, and its belongings; it"
3069,TO LADY BEAUMONT,"is a part of it. Wordsworth, and his wife and sister, were adepts in the"
3070,TO LADY BEAUMONT,laying out of grounds. (See the reference to the poet's joint labour
3071,TO LADY BEAUMONT,"with Wilkinson at Yanwath, p. 2.) It was the Wordsworths also, I"
3072,TO LADY BEAUMONT,"believe, who designed the grounds of Fox How--Dr. Arnold's residence,"
3073,TO LADY BEAUMONT,"near Ambleside. Similar memorials of the poet survive at Hallsteads,"

3853,LEICESTERSHIRE,
3854,LEICESTERSHIRE,In another letter written from Grasmere (probably in 1811) to Sir

3857,LEICESTERSHIRE,thoughts in less room. The second has brought Sir John Beaumont and his
3858,LEICESTERSHIRE,brother Francis so livelily to my mind that I recur to the plan of
3859,LEICESTERSHIRE,"republishing the former's poems, perhaps in connection with those of"
3860,LEICESTERSHIRE,"Francis."""
3861,LEICESTERSHIRE,
3862,LEICESTERSHIRE,"On November 16, 1811, he wrote to him again, ""I am glad that the"
3863,LEICESTERSHIRE,"inscriptions please you. It did always appear to me, that inscriptions,"
3864,LEICESTERSHIRE,"particularly those in verse, or in a dead language, were never supposed"
3865,LEICESTERSHIRE,_necessarily_ to be the composition of those in whose name they
3866,LEICESTERSHIRE,"appeared. If a more striking or more dramatic effect could be produced,"
3867,LEICESTERSHIRE,"I have always thought, that in an epitaph or memorial of any kind, a"
3868,LEICESTERSHIRE,"father or husband, etc., might be introduced speaking, without any"
3869,LEICESTERSHIRE,"absolute deception being intended; that is, the reader is understood to"
3870,LEICESTERSHIRE,"be at liberty to say to himself,--these verses, or this Latin, may be"
3871,LEICESTERSHIRE,"the composition of some unknown person, and not that of the father,"
3872,LEICESTERSHIRE,"widow, or friend, from whose hand or voice they profess to proceed.... I"
3873,LEICESTERSHIRE,"have altered the verses, and I have only to regret that the alteration"
3874,LEICESTERSHIRE,is not more happily done. But I never found anything more difficult. I
3875,LEICESTERSHIRE,"wished to preserve the expression _patrimonial grounds_,[A] but I found"
3876,LEICESTERSHIRE,"this impossible, on account of the awkwardness of the pronouns, he and"
3877,LEICESTERSHIRE,"his, as applied to Reynolds, and to yourself. This, even when it does"
3878,LEICESTERSHIRE,"not produce confusion, is always inelegant. I was, therefore, obliged to"
3879,LEICESTERSHIRE,"drop it; so that we must be content, I fear, with the inscription as it"
3880,LEICESTERSHIRE,"stands below. I hope it will do. I tried a hundred different ways, but"

4403,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,The original text of this _Song_ was altered but little in succeeding
4404,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"editions, and was not changed at all till 1836 and 1845. The following"
4405,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"is Wordsworth's explanatory note, appended to the poem in all the"
4406,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,editions:--
4407,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,
4408,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"""Henry Lord Clifford, etc. etc., who is the subject of this Poem,"
4409,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"was the son of John, Lord Clifford, who was slain at Towton"
4410,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"Field,[H] which John, Lord Clifford, as is known to the Reader of"
4411,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"English History, was the person who after the battle of Wakefield"
4412,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"slew, in the pursuit, the young Earl of Rutland, Son of the Duke"
4413,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"of York who had fallen in the battle, 'in part of revenge' (say"
4414,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,the Authors of the _History of Cumberland and Westmoreland_); 'for
4415,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,the Earl's Father had slain his.' A deed which worthily blemished
4416,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"the author (saith Speed); But who, as he adds, 'dare promise any"
4417,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"thing temperate of himself in the heat of martial fury? chiefly,"
4418,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,when it was resolved not to leave any branch of the York line
4419,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"standing; for so one maketh this Lord to speak.' This, no doubt, I"
4420,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"would observe by the bye, was an action sufficiently in the"
4421,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"vindictive spirit of the times, and yet not altogether so bad as"
4422,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"represented; 'for the Earl was no child, as some writers would"
4423,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"have him, but able to bear arms, being sixteen or seventeen years"
4424,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"of age, as is evident from this (say the Memoirs of the Countess"
4425,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"of Pembroke, who was laudably anxious to wipe away, as far as"
4426,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"could be, this stigma from the illustrious name to which she was"
4427,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"born); that he was the next Child to King Edward the Fourth, which"
4428,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"his mother had by Richard Duke of York, and that King was then"
4429,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,eighteen years of age: and for the small distance betwixt her
4430,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"Children, see Austin Vincent in his book of Nobility, page 622,"
4431,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"where he writes of them all. It may further be observed, that Lord"
4432,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"Clifford, who was then himself only twenty-five years of age, had"
4433,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"been a leading Man and Commander, two or three years together in"
4434,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"the Army of Lancaster, before this time; and, therefore, would be"
4435,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,less likely to think that the Earl of Rutland might be entitled to
4436,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"mercy from his youth.--But, independent of this act, at best a"
4437,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"cruel and savage one, the Family of Clifford had done enough to"
4438,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,draw upon them the vehement hatred of the House of York: so that
4439,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,after the Battle of Towton there was no hope for them but in
4440,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"flight and concealment. Henry, the subject of the Poem, was"
4441,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,deprived of his estate and honours during the space of twenty-four
4442,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"years; all which time he lived as a shepherd in Yorkshire, or in"
4443,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"Cumberland, where the estate of his Father-in-law (Sir Lancelot"
4444,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,Threlkeld) lay. He was restored to his estate and honours in the
4445,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"first year of Henry the Seventh. It is recorded that, 'when called"
4446,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"to parliament, he behaved nobly and wisely; but otherwise came"
4447,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,seldom to London or the Court; and rather delighted to live in the
4448,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"country, where he repaired several of his Castles, which had gone"
4449,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,to decay during the late troubles.' Thus far is chiefly collected
4450,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"from Nicholson and Burn; and I can add, from my own knowledge,"
4451,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,that there is a tradition current in the village of Threlkeld and
4452,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"its neighbourhood, his principal retreat, that, in the course of"
4453,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"his shepherd life, he had acquired great astronomical knowledge. I"
4454,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,cannot conclude this note without adding a word upon the subject
4455,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"of those numerous and noble feudal Edifices, spoken of in the"
4456,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"Poem, the ruins of some of which are, at this day, so great an"
4457,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,ornament to that interesting country. The Cliffords had always
4458,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,been distinguished for an honourable pride in these Castles; and
4459,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,we have seen that after the wars of York and Lancaster they were
4460,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"rebuilt; in the civil Wars of Charles the First, they were again"
4461,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"laid waste, and again restored almost to their former magnificence"
4462,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"by the celebrated Lady Anne Clifford, Countess of Pembroke, etc."
4463,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"etc. Not more than twenty-five years after this was done, when the"
4464,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"Estates of Clifford had passed into the Family of Tufton, three of"
4465,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"these Castles, namely Brough, Brougham, and Pendragon, were"
4466,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"demolished, and the timber and other materials sold by Thomas Earl"
4467,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"of Thanet. We will hope that, when this order was issued, the Earl"
4468,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"had not consulted the text of Isaiah, 58th Chap. 12th Verse, to"
4469,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"which the inscription placed over the gate of Pendragon Castle, by"
4470,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,the Countess of Pembroke (I believe his Grandmother) at the time
4471,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"she repaired that structure, refers the reader. '_And they that"
4472,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,shall be of thee shall build the old waste places; thou shalt
4473,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"raise up the foundations of many generations, and thou shalt be"
4474,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths to dwell"
4475,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"in._' The Earl of Thanet, the present possessor of the Estates,"
4476,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"with a due respect for the memory of his ancestors, and a proper"
4477,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"sense of the value and beauty of these remains of antiquity, has"

4489,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"Brougham Castle, past which the river Emont flows, is about two miles"
4490,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"out of Penrith, on the Appleby Road. It is now a ruin, but was once a"
4491,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"place of importance. The larger part of it was built by Roger, Lord"
4492,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"Clifford, son of Isabella de Veteripont, who placed over the inner door"
4493,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"the inscription, ""This made Roger."" His grandson added the eastern part."
4494,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"The castle was frequently laid waste by the Scottish Bands, and during"
4495,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,the Wars of the Roses. The Earl of Cumberland entertained James I.

4500,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"Pembroke, who wrote thus--""After I had been there myself to direct the"
4501,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"building of it, did I cause my old decayed castle of Brougham to be"

4505,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"Memoirs_, i. p. 216.) After the time of the Countess Anne, the castle"
4506,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"was neglected, and much of the stone, timber, and lead disposed of at"

4541,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,The castle of Skipton was the chief residence of the Cliffords.
4542,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,Architecturally it is of two periods: the round tower dating from the

4544,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"of Robert de Clifford, who fell at Bannockburn (1314), until the"
4545,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"seventeenth century, the estates of the Cliffords extended from Skipton"
4546,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,to Brougham Castle--seventy miles--with only a short interruption of ten
4547,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"miles. The ""Shepherd-lord"" Clifford of this poem was attainted--as"

4567,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"In the Countess of Pembroke's _Memoirs_ (vol. i. pp. 22, 228), we are"
4568,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"told that Idonea de Veteripont ""made a great part of her residence in"
4569,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"Westmoreland at Brough Castle, near Stanemore, and at Pendragon Castle,"
4570,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"in Mallerstang."" The castle was burned and destroyed by Scottish raiders"
4571,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"in 1341, and for 140 years it was in a ruinous state. It is probably to"
4572,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"this that reference is made in the phrase, ""though the sleep of years be"

4588,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"Hillbeck, formerly Hellebeck--(it was said to derive its name from the"
4589,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"waters rushing or ""helleing"" down the channel)--which descends from"
4590,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"Warcop Fell, runs through Market Brough, and joins the Eden below it."
4591,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"The date of the building of the castle of Brough is uncertain, but it is"
4592,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,probably older than the Conquest. It was sacked by the Scottish King
4593,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"William in 1174. It was ""one of the chief residences"" of Idonea de"

4595,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"Mem._, vol. i. p. 22.) Probably she rebuilt it, and changed it from a"
4596,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,tower--like Pendragon--into a castle. In the _Pembroke Memoirs_ (i. p.
4597,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"108), we read of its subsequent destruction by fire. ""A great misfortune"
4598,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"befell Henry Lord Clifford, some two years before his death, which"
4599,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,happened in 1521; his ancient and great castle of Brough-under-Stanemore

4611,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"Doubtless Appleby Castle. Its origin is equally uncertain. Before 1422,"
4612,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"John Lord Clifford, ""builded that strong and fine artificial gate-house,"
4613,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"all arched with stone, and decorated with the arms of the Veteriponts,"
4614,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"Cliffords, and Percys, which with several parts of the castle walls was"
4615,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"defaced and broken down in the civil war of 1648."" His successor,"
4616,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"Thomas, Lord Clifford, ""built the chiefest part of the castle towards"
4617,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"the east, as the hall, the chapel, and the great chamber."" This was in"
4618,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,1454. The Countess Anne Pembroke wrote of Appleby Castle thus (_Pemb.

4736,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"""The transitions and vicissitudes in this noble lyric I have"
4737,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,always thought rendered it one of the finest specimens of modern
4738,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,subjective poetry which our age has seen. The ode commences in a
4739,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"tone of high gratulation and festivity--a tone not only glad, but"
4740,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,_comparatively_ even jocund and light-hearted. The Clifford is
4741,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"restored to the home, the honours and estates of his ancestors."
4742,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,Then it sinks and falls away to the remembrance of
4743,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"tribulation--times of war and bloodshed, flight and terror, and"
4744,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"hiding away from the enemy--times of poverty and distress, when"
4745,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"the Clifford was brought, a little child, to the shelter of a"
4746,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,northern valley. After a while it emerges from those depths of
4747,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,sorrow--gradually rises into a strain of elevated tranquillity and
4748,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"contemplative rapture; through the power of imagination, the"
4749,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,beautiful and impressive aspects of nature are brought into
4750,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"relationship with the spirit of him, whose fortunes and character"
4751,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"form the subject of the piece, and are represented as gladdening"
4752,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,"and exalting it, whilst they keep it _pure and unspotted from the"
4753,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,world_. Suddenly the Poet is carried on with greater animation and
4754,HONOURS OF HIS ANCESTORS,passion: he has returned to the point whence he started--flung

4969,ADVERTISEMENT,"Mrs. Wordsworth and I were on a visit to her eldest brother, Mr."
4970,ADVERTISEMENT,"Hutchinson, at the close of the year 1807. The country is flat, and the"
4971,ADVERTISEMENT,weather was rough. I was accustomed every day to walk to and fro under
4972,ADVERTISEMENT,"the shelter of a row of stacks, in a field at a small distance from the"
4973,ADVERTISEMENT,"town, and there poured forth my verses aloud as freely as they would"
4974,ADVERTISEMENT,come. Mrs. Wordsworth reminds me that her brother stood upon the
4975,ADVERTISEMENT,punctilio of not sitting down to dinner till I joined the party; and it
4976,ADVERTISEMENT,"frequently happened that I did not make my appearance till too late, so"
4977,ADVERTISEMENT,that she was made uncomfortable. I here beg her pardon for this and
4978,ADVERTISEMENT,similar transgressions during the whole course of our wedded life. To my

4984,ADVERTISEMENT,"skin having been rubbed off my heel by my wearing too tight a shoe,"
4985,ADVERTISEMENT,"though I desisted from walking, I found that the irritation of the"
4986,ADVERTISEMENT,"wounded part was kept up, by the act of composition, to a degree that"
4987,ADVERTISEMENT,made it necessary to give my constitution a holiday. A rapid cure was
4988,ADVERTISEMENT,"the consequence. Poetic excitement, when accompanied by protracted"
4989,ADVERTISEMENT,"labour in composition, has throughout my life brought on more or less"
4990,ADVERTISEMENT,"bodily derangement. Nevertheless, I am at the close of my seventy-third"
4991,ADVERTISEMENT,"year, in what may be called excellent health; so that intellectual"
4992,ADVERTISEMENT,labour is not necessarily unfavourable to longevity. But perhaps I ought

4994,ADVERTISEMENT,
4995,ADVERTISEMENT,Let me here say a few words of this poem in the way of criticism. The
4996,ADVERTISEMENT,subject being taken from feudal times has led to its being compared to
4997,ADVERTISEMENT,some of Walter Scott's poems that belong to the same age and state of
4998,ADVERTISEMENT,society. The comparison is inconsiderate. Sir Walter pursued the
4999,ADVERTISEMENT,"customary and very natural course of conducting an action, presenting"
5000,ADVERTISEMENT,"various turns of fortune, to some outstanding point on which the mind"
5001,ADVERTISEMENT,might rest as a termination or catastrophe. The course I have attempted
5002,ADVERTISEMENT,to pursue is entirely different. Everything that is attempted by the
5003,ADVERTISEMENT,"principal personages in _The White Doe_ fails, so far as its object is"
5004,ADVERTISEMENT,external and substantial. So far as it is moral and spiritual it
5005,ADVERTISEMENT,succeeds. The heroine of the poem knows that her duty is not to
5006,ADVERTISEMENT,"interfere with the current of events, either to forward or delay them,"
5007,ADVERTISEMENT,but
5008,ADVERTISEMENT,

5167,CANTO FIRST,The bells ring loud with gladsome power;
5168,CANTO FIRST,The sun shines[3] bright; the fields are gay
5169,CANTO FIRST,With people in their best array
5170,CANTO FIRST,"Of stole and doublet, hood and scarf,                        5"
5171,CANTO FIRST,"Along the banks of crystal Wharf,[4]"
5172,CANTO FIRST,"Through the Vale retired and lowly,"
5173,CANTO FIRST,Trooping to that summons holy.
5174,CANTO FIRST,"And, up among the moorlands, see"
5175,CANTO FIRST,What sprinklings of blithe company!                         10
5176,CANTO FIRST,"Of lasses and of shepherd grooms,"
5177,CANTO FIRST,"That down the steep hills force their way,"
5178,CANTO FIRST,Like cattle through the budded brooms;
5179,CANTO FIRST,"Path, or no path, what care they?"
5180,CANTO FIRST,And thus in joyous mood they hie                            15
5181,CANTO FIRST,To Bolton's mouldering Priory.[H]
5182,CANTO FIRST,
5183,CANTO FIRST,What would they there!--full fifty years
5184,CANTO FIRST,"That sumptuous Pile, with all its peers,"
5185,CANTO FIRST,Too harshly hath been doomed to taste
5186,CANTO FIRST,The bitterness of wrong and waste:                          20
5187,CANTO FIRST,Its courts are ravaged; but the tower
5188,CANTO FIRST,"Is standing with a voice of power,[I]"
5189,CANTO FIRST,That ancient voice which wont to call
5190,CANTO FIRST,To mass or some high festival;
5191,CANTO FIRST,And in the shattered fabric's heart                         25
5192,CANTO FIRST,Remaineth one protected part;
5193,CANTO FIRST,"A Chapel, like a wild-bird's nest,"
5194,CANTO FIRST,Closely embowered and trimly drest;[5][J]
5195,CANTO FIRST,"And thither young and old repair,"
5196,CANTO FIRST,"This Sabbath-day, for praise and prayer.                    30"
5197,CANTO FIRST,
5198,CANTO FIRST,Fast the church-yard fills;--anon
5199,CANTO FIRST,"Look again, and they all are gone;"
5200,CANTO FIRST,"The cluster round the porch, and the folk"
5201,CANTO FIRST,Who sate in the shade of the Prior's Oak![K]
5202,CANTO FIRST,And scarcely have they disappeared                          35
5203,CANTO FIRST,Ere the prelusive hymn is heard:--
5204,CANTO FIRST,"With one consent the people rejoice,"
5205,CANTO FIRST,Filling the church with a lofty voice!
5206,CANTO FIRST,They sing a service which they feel:
5207,CANTO FIRST,For 'tis the sunrise now of zeal;                           40
5208,CANTO FIRST,Of a pure faith the vernal prime--[6]
5209,CANTO FIRST,In great Eliza's golden time.
5210,CANTO FIRST,
5211,CANTO FIRST,"A moment ends the fervent din,"
5212,CANTO FIRST,"And all is hushed, without and within;"
5213,CANTO FIRST,"For though the priest, more tranquilly,                     45"
5214,CANTO FIRST,"Recites the holy liturgy,"
5215,CANTO FIRST,The only voice which you can hear
5216,CANTO FIRST,Is the river murmuring near.
5217,CANTO FIRST,"--When soft!--the dusky trees between,"
5218,CANTO FIRST,"And down the path through the open green,                   50"
5219,CANTO FIRST,Where is no living thing to be seen;
5220,CANTO FIRST,"And through yon gateway, where is found,"
5221,CANTO FIRST,"Beneath the arch with ivy bound,"
5222,CANTO FIRST,Free entrance to the church-yard ground--
5223,CANTO FIRST,"[7]Comes gliding in with lovely gleam,                      55"
5224,CANTO FIRST,"Comes gliding in serene and slow,"
5225,CANTO FIRST,"Soft and silent as a dream,"
5226,CANTO FIRST,A solitary Doe!
5227,CANTO FIRST,"White she is as lily of June,"
5228,CANTO FIRST,And beauteous as the silver moon                            60
5229,CANTO FIRST,When out of sight the clouds are driven
5230,CANTO FIRST,And she is left alone in heaven;
5231,CANTO FIRST,Or like a ship some gentle day
5232,CANTO FIRST,"In sunshine sailing far away,"
5233,CANTO FIRST,"A glittering ship, that hath the plain                      65"
5234,CANTO FIRST,Of ocean for her own domain.
5235,CANTO FIRST,
5236,CANTO FIRST,"Lie silent in your graves, ye dead!"
5237,CANTO FIRST,Lie quiet in your church-yard bed!
5238,CANTO FIRST,"Ye living, tend your holy cares;"
5239,CANTO FIRST,"Ye multitude, pursue your prayers;                          70"
5240,CANTO FIRST,And blame not me if my heart and sight
5241,CANTO FIRST,Are occupied with one delight!
5242,CANTO FIRST,'Tis a work for sabbath hours

5244,CANTO FIRST,"Whether she be of forest bowers,                            75"
5245,CANTO FIRST,From the bowers of earth below;
5246,CANTO FIRST,"Or a Spirit for one day given,"
5247,CANTO FIRST,A pledge[8] of grace from purest heaven.
5248,CANTO FIRST,
5249,CANTO FIRST,What harmonious pensive changes
5250,CANTO FIRST,Wait upon her as she ranges                                 80
5251,CANTO FIRST,Round and through this Pile of state
5252,CANTO FIRST,Overthrown and desolate!
5253,CANTO FIRST,Now a step or two her way
5254,CANTO FIRST,"Leads through[9] space of open day,"
5255,CANTO FIRST,Where the enamoured sunny light                             85
5256,CANTO FIRST,Brightens her that was so bright;[L]
5257,CANTO FIRST,"Now doth a delicate shadow fall,"
5258,CANTO FIRST,"Falls upon her like a breath,"
5259,CANTO FIRST,"From some lofty arch or wall,"
5260,CANTO FIRST,As she passes underneath:                                   90
5261,CANTO FIRST,Now some gloomy nook partakes
5262,CANTO FIRST,"Of the glory that she makes,--"
5263,CANTO FIRST,"High-ribbed vault of stone, or cell,"
5264,CANTO FIRST,With perfect cunning framed as well
5265,CANTO FIRST,"Of stone, and ivy, and the spread                           95"
5266,CANTO FIRST,Of the elder's bushy head;
5267,CANTO FIRST,"Some jealous and forbidding cell,"
5268,CANTO FIRST,"That doth the living stars repel,"
5269,CANTO FIRST,And where no flower hath leave to dwell.
5270,CANTO FIRST,
5271,CANTO FIRST,The presence of this wandering Doe                       100
5272,CANTO FIRST,Fills many a damp obscure recess
5273,CANTO FIRST,With lustre of a saintly show;
5274,CANTO FIRST,"And, reappearing, she no less"
5275,CANTO FIRST,Sheds on the flowers that round her blow
5276,CANTO FIRST,A more than sunny liveliness.[10]                          105
5277,CANTO FIRST,"But say, among these holy places,"
5278,CANTO FIRST,"Which thus assiduously she paces,"
5279,CANTO FIRST,"Comes she with a votary's task,"
5280,CANTO FIRST,"Rite to perform, or boon to ask?"
5281,CANTO FIRST,Fair Pilgrim! harbours she a sense                         110
5282,CANTO FIRST,"Of sorrow, or of reverence?"
5283,CANTO FIRST,"Can she be grieved for quire or shrine,"
5284,CANTO FIRST,Crushed as if by wrath divine?
5285,CANTO FIRST,For what survives of house where God
5286,CANTO FIRST,"Was worshipped, or where Man abode;                        115"
5287,CANTO FIRST,For old magnificence undone;
5288,CANTO FIRST,Or for the gentler work begun
5289,CANTO FIRST,"By Nature, softening and concealing,"
5290,CANTO FIRST,And busy with a hand of healing?[M]
5291,CANTO FIRST,Mourns she for lordly chamber's hearth                     120
5292,CANTO FIRST,That to the sapling ash gives birth;
5293,CANTO FIRST,For dormitory's length laid bare
5294,CANTO FIRST,Where the wild rose blossoms fair;[N]
5295,CANTO FIRST,"Or altar, whence the cross was rent,"
5296,CANTO FIRST,Now rich with mossy ornament?[11]                          125
5297,CANTO FIRST,"--She sees a warrior carved in stone,"
5298,CANTO FIRST,"Among the thick weeds, stretched alone;[O]"
5299,CANTO FIRST,"A warrior, with his shield of pride"
5300,CANTO FIRST,"Cleaving humbly to his side,"
5301,CANTO FIRST,"And hands in resignation prest,                            130"
5302,CANTO FIRST,"Palm to palm, on his tranquil breast;"
5303,CANTO FIRST,As little she regards the sight[12]
5304,CANTO FIRST,As a common creature might:
5305,CANTO FIRST,"If she be doomed to inward care,"
5306,CANTO FIRST,"Or service, it must lie elsewhere.                         135"
5307,CANTO FIRST,"--But hers are eyes serenely bright,"
5308,CANTO FIRST,And on she moves--with pace how light!
5309,CANTO FIRST,"Nor spares to stoop her head, and taste"
5310,CANTO FIRST,The dewy turf with flowers bestrown;
5311,CANTO FIRST,"And thus she fares, until at last[13]                      140"
5312,CANTO FIRST,Beside the ridge of a grassy grave
5313,CANTO FIRST,In quietness she lays her down;
5314,CANTO FIRST,Gentle[14] as a weary wave
5315,CANTO FIRST,"Sinks, when the summer breeze hath died,"
5316,CANTO FIRST,Against an anchored vessel's side;                         145
5317,CANTO FIRST,"Even so, without distress, doth she"
5318,CANTO FIRST,"Lie down in peace, and lovingly."
5319,CANTO FIRST,
5320,CANTO FIRST,"The day is placid in its going,"
5321,CANTO FIRST,"To a lingering motion bound,"
5322,CANTO FIRST,Like the crystal stream now flowing                        150
5323,CANTO FIRST,With its softest summer sound:[15]
5324,CANTO FIRST,"So the balmy minutes pass,"
5325,CANTO FIRST,While this radiant Creature lies
5326,CANTO FIRST,"Couched upon the dewy grass,"
5327,CANTO FIRST,Pensively with downcast eyes.                              155
5328,CANTO FIRST,--But now again the people raise
5329,CANTO FIRST,With awful cheer a voice of praise;[16]
5330,CANTO FIRST,"It is the last, the parting song;"
5331,CANTO FIRST,"And from the temple forth they throng,"
5332,CANTO FIRST,"And quickly spread themselves abroad,                      160"
5333,CANTO FIRST,While each pursues his several road.
5334,CANTO FIRST,But some--a variegated band
5335,CANTO FIRST,"Of middle-aged, and old, and young,"
5336,CANTO FIRST,And little children by the hand
5337,CANTO FIRST,Upon their leading mothers hung--                          165
5338,CANTO FIRST,With mute obeisance gladly paid
5339,CANTO FIRST,"Turn towards the spot, where, full in view,"
5340,CANTO FIRST,"The white Doe, to her service true,[17]"
5341,CANTO FIRST,Her sabbath couch has made.
5342,CANTO FIRST,
5343,CANTO FIRST,It was a solitary mound;                                 170
5344,CANTO FIRST,Which two spears' length of level ground
5345,CANTO FIRST,Did from all other graves divide:
5346,CANTO FIRST,As if in some respect of pride;
5347,CANTO FIRST,"Or melancholy's sickly mood,"
5348,CANTO FIRST,Still shy of human neighbourhood;                          175
5349,CANTO FIRST,"Or guilt, that humbly would express"
5350,CANTO FIRST,A penitential loneliness.
5351,CANTO FIRST,
5352,CANTO FIRST,"""Look, there she is, my Child! draw near;"

5356,CANTO FIRST,"Hung back, and smiled, and blushed for joy,"
5357,CANTO FIRST,A shamed-faced blush of glowing red!
5358,CANTO FIRST,"Again the Mother whispered low,"
5359,CANTO FIRST,"""Now you have seen the famous Doe;                         185"
5360,CANTO FIRST,From Rylstone she hath found her way
5361,CANTO FIRST,Over the hills this sabbath day;
5362,CANTO FIRST,"Her work, whate'er it be, is done,"
5363,CANTO FIRST,And she will depart when we are gone;
5364,CANTO FIRST,"Thus doth she keep, from year to year,                     190"
5365,CANTO FIRST,"Her sabbath morning, foul or fair."""
5366,CANTO FIRST,
5367,CANTO FIRST,"[18]Bright was[19] the Creature, as in dreams"
5368,CANTO FIRST,"The Boy had seen her, yea, more bright;"
5369,CANTO FIRST,But is she truly what she seems?
5370,CANTO FIRST,"He asks with insecure delight,                             195"
5371,CANTO FIRST,"Asks of himself, and doubts,--and still"
5372,CANTO FIRST,The doubt returns against his will:
5373,CANTO FIRST,"Though he, and all the standers-by,"
5374,CANTO FIRST,Could tell a tragic history
5375,CANTO FIRST,"Of facts divulged, wherein appear                          200"
5376,CANTO FIRST,"Substantial motive, reason clear,"
5377,CANTO FIRST,Why thus the milk-white Doe is found
5378,CANTO FIRST,Couchant beside that lonely mound;
5379,CANTO FIRST,And why she duly loves to pace
5380,CANTO FIRST,The circuit of this hallowed place.                        205
5381,CANTO FIRST,Nor to the Child's inquiring mind
5382,CANTO FIRST,Is such perplexity confined:
5383,CANTO FIRST,"For, spite of sober Truth that sees"
5384,CANTO FIRST,A world of fixed remembrances
5385,CANTO FIRST,"Which to this mystery belong,                              210"
5386,CANTO FIRST,"If, undeceived, my skill can trace"
5387,CANTO FIRST,"The characters of every face,"
5388,CANTO FIRST,"There lack not strange delusion here,"
5389,CANTO FIRST,"Conjecture vague, and idle fear,"
5390,CANTO FIRST,"And superstitious fancies strong,                          215"
5391,CANTO FIRST,Which do the gentle Creature wrong.
5392,CANTO FIRST,
5393,CANTO FIRST,"That bearded, staff-supported Sire--"
5394,CANTO FIRST,Who in his boyhood often fed[20]
5395,CANTO FIRST,Full cheerily on convent-bread
5396,CANTO FIRST,"And heard old tales by the convent-fire,                   220"
5397,CANTO FIRST,"And to his grave will go with scars,"
5398,CANTO FIRST,Relics of long and distant wars--[21]
5399,CANTO FIRST,"That Old Man, studious to expound"
5400,CANTO FIRST,"The spectacle, is mounting[22] high"
5401,CANTO FIRST,To days of dim antiquity;                                  225
5402,CANTO FIRST,When Lady A√§liza mourned
5403,CANTO FIRST,"Her Son,[P] and felt in her despair"
5404,CANTO FIRST,The pang of unavailing prayer;
5405,CANTO FIRST,"Her Son in Wharf's abysses drowned,"
5406,CANTO FIRST,The noble Boy of Egremound.[Q]                             230
5407,CANTO FIRST,From which affliction--when the grace
5408,CANTO FIRST,Of God had in her heart found place--[23]
5409,CANTO FIRST,"A pious structure, fair to see,"
5410,CANTO FIRST,"Rose up, this stately Priory!"
5411,CANTO FIRST,The Lady's work;--but now laid low;                        235
5412,CANTO FIRST,"To the grief of her soul that doth come and go,"
5413,CANTO FIRST,In the beautiful form of this innocent Doe:
5414,CANTO FIRST,"Which, though seemingly doomed in its breast to sustain"
5415,CANTO FIRST,"A softened remembrance of sorrow and pain,"
5416,CANTO FIRST,"Is spotless, and holy, and gentle, and bright;             240"
5417,CANTO FIRST,And glides o'er the earth like an angel of light.
5418,CANTO FIRST,
5419,CANTO FIRST,"Pass, pass who will, yon chantry door;[R]"
5420,CANTO FIRST,"And, through the chink in the fractured floor"
5421,CANTO FIRST,"Look down, and see a griesly sight;"
5422,CANTO FIRST,A vault where the bodies are buried upright![S]            245
5423,CANTO FIRST,"There, face by face, and hand by hand,"
5424,CANTO FIRST,The Claphams and Mauleverers stand;
5425,CANTO FIRST,"And, in his place, among son and sire,"
5426,CANTO FIRST,"Is John de Clapham, that fierce Esquire,"
5427,CANTO FIRST,"A valiant man, and a name of dread                         250"
5428,CANTO FIRST,In the ruthless wars of the White and Red;
5429,CANTO FIRST,Who dragged Earl Pembroke from Banbury church
5430,CANTO FIRST,And smote off his head on the stones of the porch!
5431,CANTO FIRST,"Look down among them, if you dare;"
5432,CANTO FIRST,"Oft does the White Doe loiter there,                       255"
5433,CANTO FIRST,Prying into the darksome rent;
5434,CANTO FIRST,Nor can it be with good intent:
5435,CANTO FIRST,"So thinks that Dame of haughty air,"
5436,CANTO FIRST,"Who hath a Page her book to hold,"
5437,CANTO FIRST,And wears a frontlet edged with gold.                      260
5438,CANTO FIRST,Harsh thoughts with her high mood agree--
5439,CANTO FIRST,Who counts among her ancestry[24]
5440,CANTO FIRST,"Earl Pembroke, slain so impiously!"
5441,CANTO FIRST,
5442,CANTO FIRST,"That slender Youth, a scholar pale,"
5443,CANTO FIRST,"From Oxford come to his native vale,                       265"
5444,CANTO FIRST,He also hath his own conceit:
5445,CANTO FIRST,"It is, thinks he, the gracious Fairy,"
5446,CANTO FIRST,Who loved the Shepherd-lord to meet[T]
5447,CANTO FIRST,In his wanderings solitary:
5448,CANTO FIRST,"Wild notes she in his hearing sang,                        270"
5449,CANTO FIRST,A song of Nature's hidden powers;
5450,CANTO FIRST,"That whistled like the wind, and rang"
5451,CANTO FIRST,Among the rocks and holly bowers.
5452,CANTO FIRST,'Twas said that She all shapes could wear;
5453,CANTO FIRST,"And oftentimes before him stood,                           275"
5454,CANTO FIRST,"Amid the trees of some thick wood,"
5455,CANTO FIRST,In semblance of a lady fair;
5456,CANTO FIRST,"And taught him signs, and showed him sights,"
5457,CANTO FIRST,"In Craven's dens, on Cumbrian[25] heights;"
5458,CANTO FIRST,"When under cloud of fear he lay,                           280"
5459,CANTO FIRST,A shepherd clad in homely grey;
5460,CANTO FIRST,Nor left him at his later day.
5461,CANTO FIRST,"And hence, when he, with spear and shield,"
5462,CANTO FIRST,"Rode full of years to Flodden-field,"
5463,CANTO FIRST,"His eye could see the hidden spring,                       285"
5464,CANTO FIRST,And how the current was to flow;
5465,CANTO FIRST,"The fatal end of Scotland's King,"
5466,CANTO FIRST,And all that hopeless overthrow.
5467,CANTO FIRST,"But not in wars did he delight,"
5468,CANTO FIRST,_This_ Clifford wished for worthier might;                 290
5469,CANTO FIRST,"Nor in broad pomp, or courtly state;"
5470,CANTO FIRST,"Him his own thoughts did elevate,--"
5471,CANTO FIRST,Most happy in the shy recess
5472,CANTO FIRST,Of Barden's lowly[26] quietness.[U]
5473,CANTO FIRST,And choice of studious friends had he                      295
5474,CANTO FIRST,Of Bolton's dear fraternity;
5475,CANTO FIRST,"Who, standing on this old church tower,"
5476,CANTO FIRST,"In many a calm propitious hour,"
5477,CANTO FIRST,"Perused, with him, the starry sky;"
5478,CANTO FIRST,"Or, in their cells, with him did pry                       300"
5479,CANTO FIRST,"For other lore,--by keen desire"
5480,CANTO FIRST,Urged to close toil with chemic fire;[27]
5481,CANTO FIRST,In quest belike of transmutations
5482,CANTO FIRST,Rich as the mine's most bright creations.[28]
5483,CANTO FIRST,"But they and their good works are fled,                    305"
5484,CANTO FIRST,And all is now disquieted--
5485,CANTO FIRST,"And peace is none, for living or dead!"
5486,CANTO FIRST,
5487,CANTO FIRST,"Ah, pensive Scholar, think not so,"
5488,CANTO FIRST,But look again at the radiant Doe!
5489,CANTO FIRST,"What quiet watch she seems to keep,                        310"
5490,CANTO FIRST,"Alone, beside that grassy heap!"
5491,CANTO FIRST,Why mention other thoughts unmeet
5492,CANTO FIRST,For vision so composed and sweet?
5493,CANTO FIRST,"While stand the people in a ring,"
5494,CANTO FIRST,"Gazing, doubting, questioning;                             315"
5495,CANTO FIRST,"Yea, many overcome in spite"
5496,CANTO FIRST,Of recollections clear and bright;
5497,CANTO FIRST,Which yet do unto some impart
5498,CANTO FIRST,An undisturbed repose of heart.
5499,CANTO FIRST,And all the assembly own a law                             320
5500,CANTO FIRST,Of orderly respect and awe;
5501,CANTO FIRST,"But see--they vanish one by one,"
5502,CANTO FIRST,"And last, the Doe herself is gone."
5503,CANTO FIRST,
5504,CANTO FIRST,Harp! we have been full long beguiled
5505,CANTO FIRST,"By vague thoughts, lured by fancies wild;[29]              325"
5506,CANTO FIRST,"To which, with no reluctant strings,"
5507,CANTO FIRST,Thou hast attuned thy murmurings;
5508,CANTO FIRST,And now before this Pile we stand
5509,CANTO FIRST,"In solitude, and utter peace:"
5510,CANTO FIRST,"But, Harp! thy murmurs may not cease--                     330"
5511,CANTO FIRST,"A Spirit, with his angelic wings,"
5512,CANTO FIRST,"In soft and breeze-like visitings,"
5513,CANTO FIRST,Has touched thee--and a Spirit's hand:[30]
5514,CANTO FIRST,A voice is with us--a command
5515,CANTO FIRST,"To chant, in strains of heavenly glory,                    335"
5516,CANTO FIRST,"A tale of tears, a mortal story!"
5517,CANTO FIRST,
5518,CANTO FIRST,
5519,CANTO SECOND,CANTO SECOND
5520,CANTO SECOND,
5521,CANTO SECOND,The Harp in lowliness obeyed;
5522,CANTO SECOND,And first we sang of the green-wood shade
5523,CANTO SECOND,And a solitary Maid;
5524,CANTO SECOND,"Beginning, where the song must end,"
5525,CANTO SECOND,"With her, and with her sylvan Friend;                        5"
5526,CANTO SECOND,"The Friend, who stood before her sight,"
5527,CANTO SECOND,Her only unextinguished light;
5528,CANTO SECOND,Her last companion in a dearth
5529,CANTO SECOND,"Of love, upon a hopeless earth."
5530,CANTO SECOND,
5531,CANTO SECOND,"For She it was--this Maid, who wrought[31]                10"
5532,CANTO SECOND,"Meekly, with foreboding thought,"
5533,CANTO SECOND,In vermeil colours and in gold
5534,CANTO SECOND,"An unblest work; which, standing by,"
5535,CANTO SECOND,"Her Father did with joy behold,--"
5536,CANTO SECOND,Exulting in its[32] imagery;                                15
5537,CANTO SECOND,"A Banner, fashioned to fulfil[33]"
5538,CANTO SECOND,Too perfectly his headstrong will:
5539,CANTO SECOND,For on this Banner had her hand
5540,CANTO SECOND,Embroidered (such her Sire's command)[34]
5541,CANTO SECOND,The sacred Cross; and figured there                         20
5542,CANTO SECOND,The five dear wounds our Lord did bear;
5543,CANTO SECOND,"Full soon to be uplifted high,"
5544,CANTO SECOND,And float in rueful company!
5545,CANTO SECOND,
5546,CANTO SECOND,It was the time when England's Queen                      24
5547,CANTO SECOND,"Twelve years had reigned, a Sovereign dread;[V]"
5548,CANTO SECOND,Nor yet the restless crown had been
5549,CANTO SECOND,Disturbed upon her virgin head;
5550,CANTO SECOND,But now the inly-working North
5551,CANTO SECOND,"Was ripe to send its thousands forth,"
5552,CANTO SECOND,"A potent vassalage, to fight                                30"
5553,CANTO SECOND,"In Percy's and in Neville's right,[W]"
5554,CANTO SECOND,"Two Earls fast leagued in discontent,"
5555,CANTO SECOND,Who gave their wishes open vent;
5556,CANTO SECOND,"And boldly urged a general plea,"
5557,CANTO SECOND,The rites of ancient piety                                  35
5558,CANTO SECOND,"To be triumphantly restored,"
5559,CANTO SECOND,By the stern justice of the sword![35]
5560,CANTO SECOND,And that same Banner on whose breast
5561,CANTO SECOND,The blameless Lady had exprest
5562,CANTO SECOND,Memorials chosen to give life                               40
5563,CANTO SECOND,And sunshine to a dangerous strife;
5564,CANTO SECOND,"That[36] Banner, waiting for the Call,"
5565,CANTO SECOND,Stood quietly in Rylstone-hall.
5566,CANTO SECOND,
5567,CANTO SECOND,"It came; and Francis Norton said,"
5568,CANTO SECOND,"""O Father! rise not in this fray--                          45"
5569,CANTO SECOND,The hairs are white upon your head;
5570,CANTO SECOND,"Dear Father, hear me when I say"
5571,CANTO SECOND,It is for you too late a day!
5572,CANTO SECOND,Bethink you of your own good name:
5573,CANTO SECOND,"A just and gracious queen have we,                          50"
5574,CANTO SECOND,"A pure religion, and the claim"
5575,CANTO SECOND,Of peace on our humanity.--
5576,CANTO SECOND,'Tis meet that I endure your scorn;
5577,CANTO SECOND,"I am your son, your eldest born;"
5578,CANTO SECOND,"But not for lordship or for land,                           55"
5579,CANTO SECOND,"My Father, do I clasp your knees;"
5580,CANTO SECOND,"The Banner touch not, stay your hand,"
5581,CANTO SECOND,"This multitude of men disband,"
5582,CANTO SECOND,And live at home in blameless[37] ease;
5583,CANTO SECOND,"For these my brethren's sake, for me;                       60"
5584,CANTO SECOND,"And, most of all, for Emily!"""
5585,CANTO SECOND,
5586,CANTO SECOND,Tumultuous noises filled the hall;[38]
5587,CANTO SECOND,And scarcely could the Father hear
5588,CANTO SECOND,That name--pronounced with a dying fall--[39][X]
5589,CANTO SECOND,"The name of his only Daughter dear,                         65"
5590,CANTO SECOND,As on[40] the banner which stood near
5591,CANTO SECOND,"He glanced a look of holy pride,"
5592,CANTO SECOND,And his moist[41] eyes were glorified;
5593,CANTO SECOND,"Then did he seize the staff, and say:[42]"
5594,CANTO SECOND,"""Thou, Richard, bear'st thy father's name,                  70"
5595,CANTO SECOND,Keep thou this ensign till the day
5596,CANTO SECOND,When I of thee require the same:
5597,CANTO SECOND,Thy place be on my better hand;--
5598,CANTO SECOND,"And seven as true as thou, I see,"
5599,CANTO SECOND,"Will cleave to this good cause and me.""                     75"
5600,CANTO SECOND,"He spake, and eight brave sons straightway"
5601,CANTO SECOND,"All followed him, a gallant band!"
5602,CANTO SECOND,
5603,CANTO SECOND,"Thus, with his sons, when forth he came"
5604,CANTO SECOND,The sight was hailed with loud acclaim
5605,CANTO SECOND,"And din of arms and minstrelsy,[43]                         80"
5606,CANTO SECOND,"From all his warlike tenantry,"
5607,CANTO SECOND,"All horsed and harnessed with him to ride,--"
5608,CANTO SECOND,A voice[44] to which the hills replied!
5609,CANTO SECOND,
5610,CANTO SECOND,"But Francis, in the vacant hall,"
5611,CANTO SECOND,"Stood silent under dreary weight,--                         85"
5612,CANTO SECOND,"A phantasm, in which roof and wall"
5613,CANTO SECOND,"Shook, tottered, swam before his sight;"
5614,CANTO SECOND,A phantasm like a dream of night!
5615,CANTO SECOND,"Thus overwhelmed, and desolate,"
5616,CANTO SECOND,He found his way to a postern-gate;                         90
5617,CANTO SECOND,"And, when he waked, his languid eye[45]"
5618,CANTO SECOND,Was on the calm and silent sky;
5619,CANTO SECOND,"With air about him breathing sweet,"
5620,CANTO SECOND,And earth's green grass beneath his feet;
5621,CANTO SECOND,Nor did he fail ere long to hear                            95
5622,CANTO SECOND,"A sound of military cheer,"
5623,CANTO SECOND,Faint--but it reached that sheltered spot;
5624,CANTO SECOND,"He heard, and it disturbed him not."
5625,CANTO SECOND,
5626,CANTO SECOND,"There stood he, leaning on a lance"
5627,CANTO SECOND,"Which he had grasped unknowingly,                          100"
5628,CANTO SECOND,"Had blindly grasped in that strong trance,"
5629,CANTO SECOND,That dimness of heart-agony;
5630,CANTO SECOND,"There stood he, cleansed from the despair"
5631,CANTO SECOND,And sorrow of his fruitless prayer.
5632,CANTO SECOND,The past he calmly hath reviewed:                          105
5633,CANTO SECOND,But where will be the fortitude
5634,CANTO SECOND,"Of this brave man, when he shall see"
5635,CANTO SECOND,"That Form beneath the spreading tree,"
5636,CANTO SECOND,And know that it is Emily?[46]
5637,CANTO SECOND,
5638,CANTO SECOND,He saw her where in open view                            110
5639,CANTO SECOND,She sate beneath the spreading yew--
5640,CANTO SECOND,"Her head upon her lap, concealing"
5641,CANTO SECOND,In solitude her bitter feeling:
5642,CANTO SECOND,"[47]""Might ever son _command_ a sire,"
5643,CANTO SECOND,"The act were justified to-day.""                            115"
5644,CANTO SECOND,"This to himself--and to the Maid,"
5645,CANTO SECOND,"Whom now he had approached, he said--"
5646,CANTO SECOND,"""Gone are they,--they have their desire;"
5647,CANTO SECOND,"And I with thee one hour will stay,"
5648,CANTO SECOND,"To give thee comfort if I may.""                            120"
5649,CANTO SECOND,
5650,CANTO SECOND,"She heard, but looked not up, nor spake;"
5651,CANTO SECOND,And sorrow moved him to partake
5652,CANTO SECOND,"Her silence; then his thoughts turned round,[48]"
5653,CANTO SECOND,And fervent words a passage found.
5654,CANTO SECOND,
5655,CANTO SECOND,"""Gone are they, bravely, though misled;                  125"
5656,CANTO SECOND,With a dear Father at their head!
5657,CANTO SECOND,The Sons obey a natural lord;
5658,CANTO SECOND,The Father had given solemn word
5659,CANTO SECOND,To noble Percy; and a force
5660,CANTO SECOND,"Still stronger, bends him to his course.                   130"
5661,CANTO SECOND,"This said, our tears to-day may fall"
5662,CANTO SECOND,As at an innocent funeral.
5663,CANTO SECOND,In deep and awful channel runs
5664,CANTO SECOND,This sympathy of Sire and Sons;
5665,CANTO SECOND,Untried our Brothers have been loved[49]                   135
5666,CANTO SECOND,With heart by simple nature moved;[50]
5667,CANTO SECOND,And now their faithfulness is proved:
5668,CANTO SECOND,"For faithful we must call them, bearing"
5669,CANTO SECOND,That soul of conscientious daring.
5670,CANTO SECOND,--There were they all in circle--there                     140
5671,CANTO SECOND,"Stood Richard, Ambrose, Christopher,"
5672,CANTO SECOND,"John with a sword that will not fail,"
5673,CANTO SECOND,"And Marmaduke in fearless mail,"
5674,CANTO SECOND,And those bright Twins were side by side;
5675,CANTO SECOND,"And there, by fresh hopes beautified,                      145"
5676,CANTO SECOND,"Stood He,[51] whose arm yet lacks the power"
5677,CANTO SECOND,"Of man, our youngest, fairest flower!"
5678,CANTO SECOND,"I, by the right[52] of eldest born,"
5679,CANTO SECOND,"And in a second father's place,"
5680,CANTO SECOND,"Presumed to grapple with[53] their scorn,                  150"
5681,CANTO SECOND,And meet their pity face to face;
5682,CANTO SECOND,"Yea, trusting in God's holy aid,"
5683,CANTO SECOND,I to my Father knelt and prayed;
5684,CANTO SECOND,"And one, the pensive Marmaduke,"
5685,CANTO SECOND,"Methought, was yielding inwardly,                          155"
5686,CANTO SECOND,"And would have laid his purpose by,"
5687,CANTO SECOND,"But for a glance of his Father's eye,"
5688,CANTO SECOND,Which I myself could scarcely brook.
5689,CANTO SECOND,
5690,CANTO SECOND,"""Then be we, each and all, forgiven!"
5691,CANTO SECOND,"Thou, chiefly thou,[54] my Sister dear,                    160"
5692,CANTO SECOND,Whose pangs are registered in heaven--
5693,CANTO SECOND,"The stifled sigh, the hidden tear,"
5694,CANTO SECOND,"And smiles, that dared to take their place,"
5695,CANTO SECOND,"Meek filial smiles, upon thy face,"
5696,CANTO SECOND,As that unhallowed Banner grew                             165
5697,CANTO SECOND,Beneath a loving old Man's view.
5698,CANTO SECOND,Thy part is done--thy painful part;

5700,CANTO SECOND,"A further, though far easier, task"
5701,CANTO SECOND,"Than thine hath been, my duties ask;                       170"
5702,CANTO SECOND,"With theirs my efforts cannot blend,"
5703,CANTO SECOND,I cannot for such cause contend;
5704,CANTO SECOND,Their aims I utterly forswear;
5705,CANTO SECOND,But I in body will be there.
5706,CANTO SECOND,"Unarmed and naked will I go,                               175"
5707,CANTO SECOND,"Be at their side, come weal or woe:"

5712,CANTO SECOND,Which he had grasped in that strong trance;
5713,CANTO SECOND,"Spurned it, like something that would stand"
5714,CANTO SECOND,Between him and the pure intent
5715,CANTO SECOND,Of love on which his soul was bent.
5716,CANTO SECOND,
5717,CANTO SECOND,"""For thee, for thee, is left the sense                   185"
5718,CANTO SECOND,Of trial past without offence
5719,CANTO SECOND,"To God or man; such innocence,"
5720,CANTO SECOND,"Such consolation, and the excess"
5721,CANTO SECOND,Of an unmerited distress;
5722,CANTO SECOND,In that thy very strength must lie.                        190
5723,CANTO SECOND,"--O Sister, I could prophesy!"
5724,CANTO SECOND,The time is come that rings the knell
5725,CANTO SECOND,"Of all we loved, and loved so well:"
5726,CANTO SECOND,"Hope nothing, if I thus may speak"
5727,CANTO SECOND,"To thee, a woman, and thence weak:                         195"
5728,CANTO SECOND,"Hope nothing, I repeat; for we"
5729,CANTO SECOND,Are doomed to perish utterly:
5730,CANTO SECOND,'Tis meet that thou with me divide
5731,CANTO SECOND,"The thought while I am by thy side,"
5732,CANTO SECOND,"Acknowledging a grace in this,                             200"
5733,CANTO SECOND,A comfort in the dark abyss.
5734,CANTO SECOND,"But look not for me when I am gone,"
5735,CANTO SECOND,And be no farther wrought upon:
5736,CANTO SECOND,"Farewell all wishes, all debate,"
5737,CANTO SECOND,"All prayers for this cause, or for that!                   205"
5738,CANTO SECOND,"Weep, if that aid thee; but depend"
5739,CANTO SECOND,Upon no help of outward friend;
5740,CANTO SECOND,"Espouse thy doom at once, and cleave"
5741,CANTO SECOND,To fortitude without reprieve.
5742,CANTO SECOND,"For we must fall, both we and ours--                       210"
5743,CANTO SECOND,"This Mansion and these pleasant bowers,"
5744,CANTO SECOND,"Walks, pools, and arbours, homestead, hall--"
5745,CANTO SECOND,"Our fate is theirs, will reach them all;[Z]"
5746,CANTO SECOND,"The young horse must forsake his manger,"
5747,CANTO SECOND,And learn to glory in a Stranger;                          215
5748,CANTO SECOND,The hawk forget his perch; the hound
5749,CANTO SECOND,Be parted from his ancient ground:

5759,CANTO SECOND,She was before she hither came;
5760,CANTO SECOND,"Ere she had learned to love us all,"
5761,CANTO SECOND,Herself beloved in Rylstone-hall.
5762,CANTO SECOND,"--But thou, my Sister, doomed to be                        230"
5763,CANTO SECOND,The last leaf on a blasted tree;[55]
5764,CANTO SECOND,If not in vain we breathed[56] the breath
5765,CANTO SECOND,Together of a purer faith;
5766,CANTO SECOND,"If hand in hand we have been led,"
5767,CANTO SECOND,"And thou, (O happy thought this day!)                      235"

5774,CANTO SECOND,Forbearance and self-sacrifice;

5788,CANTO SECOND,He kissed the consecrated Maid;                            255
5789,CANTO SECOND,"And down the valley then pursued,[57]"
5790,CANTO SECOND,"Alone, the arm√®d Multitude."

5797,CANTO THIRD,Telling melancholy hours!
5798,CANTO THIRD,"Proclaim it, let your Masters hear"

5802,CANTO THIRD,"Well-pleased, the arm√®d Company[59]"
5803,CANTO THIRD,Marching down the banks of Were.

5805,CANTO THIRD,Said fearless Norton to the pair                          10
5806,CANTO THIRD,Gone forth to greet[60] him on the plain
5807,CANTO THIRD,"""This meeting, noble Lords! looks fair,"
5808,CANTO THIRD,I bring with me a goodly train;
5809,CANTO THIRD,Their hearts are with you: hill and dale

5811,CANTO THIRD,And horse and harness followed--see
5812,CANTO THIRD,The best part of their Yeomanry!
5813,CANTO THIRD,"--Stand forth, my Sons!--these eight are mine,"
5814,CANTO THIRD,Whom to this service I commend;
5815,CANTO THIRD,"Which way soe'er our fate incline,                          20"

5822,CANTO THIRD,"These Eight, and this is a day of pride!"
5823,CANTO THIRD,The time is ripe. With festive din
5824,CANTO THIRD,"Lo! how the people are flocking in,--"
5825,CANTO THIRD,Like hungry fowl to the feeder's hand                       30
5826,CANTO THIRD,"When snow lies heavy upon the land."""
5827,CANTO THIRD,
5828,CANTO THIRD,He spake bare truth; for far and near
5829,CANTO THIRD,From every side came noisy swarms
5830,CANTO THIRD,Of Peasants in their homely gear;
5831,CANTO THIRD,"And, mixed with these, to Brancepeth came                   35"
5832,CANTO THIRD,"Grave Gentry of estate and name,"
5833,CANTO THIRD,And Captains known for worth in arms;

5888,CANTO THIRD,[62]A voice of uttermost joy brake out:
5889,CANTO THIRD,"The transport was rolled down the river of Were,"
5890,CANTO THIRD,"And Durham, the time-honoured Durham, did hear,"
5891,CANTO THIRD,And the towers of Saint Cuthbert were stirred by the shout![BB]
5892,CANTO THIRD,
5893,CANTO THIRD,Now was the North in arms:--they shine                    95
5894,CANTO THIRD,"In warlike trim from Tweed to Tyne,"
5895,CANTO THIRD,At Percy's voice: and Neville sees

5938,CANTO THIRD,Rare sight to embolden and inspire!

5940,CANTO THIRD,"Of him the most; and, sooth to say,"
5941,CANTO THIRD,No shape of man in all the array
5942,CANTO THIRD,So graced the sunshine of that day.
5943,CANTO THIRD,The monumental pomp of age
5944,CANTO THIRD,Was with this goodly Personage;                            145
5945,CANTO THIRD,"A stature undepressed in size,"
5946,CANTO THIRD,"Unbent, which rather seemed to rise,"
5947,CANTO THIRD,In open victory o'er the weight
5948,CANTO THIRD,"Of seventy years, to loftier[71] height;"
5949,CANTO THIRD,Magnific limbs of withered state;                          150
5950,CANTO THIRD,A face to fear and venerate;
5951,CANTO THIRD,Eyes dark and strong; and on his head
5952,CANTO THIRD,"Bright[72] locks of silver hair, thick spread,"
5953,CANTO THIRD,"Which a brown morion half-concealed,"
5954,CANTO THIRD,Light as a hunter's of the field;                          155
5955,CANTO THIRD,"And thus, with girdle round his waist,"
5956,CANTO THIRD,Whereon the Banner-staff might rest
5957,CANTO THIRD,"At need, he stood, advancing high"
5958,CANTO THIRD,"The glittering, floating Pageantry."
5959,CANTO THIRD,
5960,CANTO THIRD,"Who sees him?--thousands see,[73] and One                160"
5961,CANTO THIRD,With unparticipated gaze;
5962,CANTO THIRD,"Who, 'mong those[74] thousands, friend hath none,"
5963,CANTO THIRD,And treads in solitary ways.

5966,CANTO THIRD,"As shepherds watch a lonely star,"
5967,CANTO THIRD,Or mariners the distant light
5968,CANTO THIRD,That guides them through[75] a stormy night.
5969,CANTO THIRD,"And now, upon a chosen plot"
5970,CANTO THIRD,"Of rising ground, yon heathy spot!                         170"
5971,CANTO THIRD,"He takes alone[76] his far-off stand,"

5973,CANTO THIRD,Bold is his aspect; but his eye
5974,CANTO THIRD,"Is pregnant with anxiety,"

5976,CANTO THIRD,He there stands fixed from hour to hour:
5977,CANTO THIRD,"Yet sometimes in more humble guise,"
5978,CANTO THIRD,Upon the turf-clad height he lies
5979,CANTO THIRD,"Stretched, herdsman-like, as if to bask"
5980,CANTO THIRD,"In sunshine were his only task,[77]                        180"
5981,CANTO THIRD,Or by his mantle's help to find
5982,CANTO THIRD,A shelter from the nipping wind:
5983,CANTO THIRD,"And thus, with short oblivion blest,"
5984,CANTO THIRD,His weary spirits gather rest.
5985,CANTO THIRD,Again he lifts his eyes; and lo!                           185
5986,CANTO THIRD,The pageant glancing to and fro;
5987,CANTO THIRD,"And hope is wakened by the sight,"
5988,CANTO THIRD,"He[78] thence may learn, ere fall of night,"
5989,CANTO THIRD,Which way the tide is doomed to flow.
5990,CANTO THIRD,
5991,CANTO THIRD,To London were the Chieftains bent;                      190
5992,CANTO THIRD,But what avails the bold intent?
5993,CANTO THIRD,A Royal army is gone forth
5994,CANTO THIRD,To quell the RISING OF THE NORTH;
5995,CANTO THIRD,"They march with Dudley at their head,"
5996,CANTO THIRD,"And, in seven days' space, will to York be led!--"
5997,CANTO THIRD,Can such a mighty Host be raised                           196
5998,CANTO THIRD,"Thus suddenly, and brought so near?"
5999,CANTO THIRD,"The Earls upon each other gazed,"
6000,CANTO THIRD,And Neville's cheek grew pale with fear;
6001,CANTO THIRD,"For, with a high and valiant name,                         200"
6002,CANTO THIRD,He bore a heart of timid frame;[79]
6003,CANTO THIRD,"And bold if both had been, yet they"
6004,CANTO THIRD,"""Against so many may not stay.""[FF]"
6005,CANTO THIRD,Back therefore will they hie to seize[80]
6006,CANTO THIRD,A strong Hold on the banks of Tees;                        205
6007,CANTO THIRD,"There wait a favourable hour,"
6008,CANTO THIRD,Until Lord Dacre with his power
6009,CANTO THIRD,From Naworth come;[81][GG] and Howard's aid
6010,CANTO THIRD,Be with them openly displayed.
6011,CANTO THIRD,
6012,CANTO THIRD,"While through the Host, from man to man,                 210"
6013,CANTO THIRD,"A rumour of this purpose ran,"
6014,CANTO THIRD,The Standard trusting[82] to the care
6015,CANTO THIRD,Of him who heretofore did bear
6016,CANTO THIRD,"That charge, impatient Norton sought"
6017,CANTO THIRD,"The Chieftains to unfold his thought,                      215"
6018,CANTO THIRD,"And thus abruptly spake;--""We yield"
6019,CANTO THIRD,(And can it be?) an unfought field!--
6020,CANTO THIRD,"How oft has strength, the strength of heaven,[83]"
6021,CANTO THIRD,To few triumphantly been given!
6022,CANTO THIRD,Still do our very children boast                           220
6023,CANTO THIRD,Of mitred Thurston--what a Host
6024,CANTO THIRD,He conquered![HH]--Saw we not the Plain
6025,CANTO THIRD,(And flying shall behold again)
6026,CANTO THIRD,Where faith was proved?--while to battle moved
6027,CANTO THIRD,"The Standard, on the Sacred Wain                           225"
6028,CANTO THIRD,"That bore it, compassed round by a bold"
6029,CANTO THIRD,Fraternity of Barons old;
6030,CANTO THIRD,"And with those grey-haired champions stood,"
6031,CANTO THIRD,"Under the saintly ensigns three,"
6032,CANTO THIRD,The infant Heir of Mowbray's blood--                       230
6033,CANTO THIRD,All confident of victory!--[84]
6034,CANTO THIRD,"Shall Percy blush, then, for his name?"
6035,CANTO THIRD,Must Westmoreland be asked with shame
6036,CANTO THIRD,"Whose were the numbers, where the loss,"
6037,CANTO THIRD,In that other day of Neville's Cross?[II]                  235
6038,CANTO THIRD,When the Prior of Durham with holy hand
6039,CANTO THIRD,"Raised, as the Vision gave command,"
6040,CANTO THIRD,Saint Cuthbert's Relic--far and near
6041,CANTO THIRD,Kenned on the point of a lofty spear;
6042,CANTO THIRD,While the Monks prayed in Maiden's Bower                   240
6043,CANTO THIRD,To God descending in his power.[85]
6044,CANTO THIRD,Less would not at our need be due
6045,CANTO THIRD,"To us, who war against the Untrue;--"
6046,CANTO THIRD,"The delegates of Heaven we rise,"
6047,CANTO THIRD,Convoked the impious to chastise:                          245
6048,CANTO THIRD,"We, we, the sanctities of old"
6049,CANTO THIRD,Would re-establish and uphold:
6050,CANTO THIRD,"Be warned""--His zeal the Chiefs confounded,[86]"
6051,CANTO THIRD,"But word was given, and the trumpet sounded:"
6052,CANTO THIRD,Back through the melancholy Host                           250
6053,CANTO THIRD,"Went Norton, and resumed his post."
6054,CANTO THIRD,"Alas! thought he, and have I borne"
6055,CANTO THIRD,"This Banner raised with joyful pride,[87]"
6056,CANTO THIRD,"This hope of all posterity,"
6057,CANTO THIRD,By those dread symbols sanctified;[88]                     255
6058,CANTO THIRD,Thus to become at once the scorn
6059,CANTO THIRD,"Of babbling winds as they go by,"
6060,CANTO THIRD,"A spot of shame to the sun's bright eye,"
6061,CANTO THIRD,To the light[89] clouds a mockery!
6062,CANTO THIRD,"--""Even these poor eight of mine would stem""--"
6063,CANTO THIRD,"Half to himself, and half to them                          261"
6064,CANTO THIRD,"He spake--""would stem, or quell, a force"
6065,CANTO THIRD,"Ten times their number, man and horse;"
6066,CANTO THIRD,"This by their own unaided might,"
6067,CANTO THIRD,"Without their father in their sight,                       265"
6068,CANTO THIRD,Without the Cause for which they fight;
6069,CANTO THIRD,"A Cause, which on a needful day"
6070,CANTO THIRD,"Would breed us thousands brave as they."""
6071,CANTO THIRD,"--So speaking, he his reverend head"
6072,CANTO THIRD,Raised towards that Imagery once more:[90]                 270
6073,CANTO THIRD,But the familiar prospect shed
6074,CANTO THIRD,Despondency unfelt before:
6075,CANTO THIRD,"A shock of intimations vain,"
6076,CANTO THIRD,"Dismay,[91] and superstitious pain,"
6077,CANTO THIRD,"Fell on him, with the sudden thought                       275"
6078,CANTO THIRD,Of her by whom the work was wrought:--
6079,CANTO THIRD,Oh wherefore was her countenance bright
6080,CANTO THIRD,With love divine and gentle light?
6081,CANTO THIRD,"She would not, could not, disobey,[92]"
6082,CANTO THIRD,But her Faith leaned another way.                          280
6083,CANTO THIRD,"Ill tears she wept; I saw them fall,"
6084,CANTO THIRD,I overheard her as she spake
6085,CANTO THIRD,"Sad words to that mute Animal,"
6086,CANTO THIRD,"The White Doe, in the hawthorn brake;"
6087,CANTO THIRD,"She steeped, but not for Jesu's sake,                      285"
6088,CANTO THIRD,"This Cross in tears: by her, and One"
6089,CANTO THIRD,Unworthier far we are undone--
6090,CANTO THIRD,Her recreant Brother--he prevailed
6091,CANTO THIRD,Over that tender Spirit--assailed
6092,CANTO THIRD,Too oft alas! by her whose head[93]                        290
6093,CANTO THIRD,In the cold grave hath long been laid:
6094,CANTO THIRD,"She first, in reason's dawn beguiled"
6095,CANTO THIRD,"Her docile, unsuspecting Child:[94]"
6096,CANTO THIRD,Far back--far back my mind must go
6097,CANTO THIRD,To reach the well-spring of this woe!                      295
6098,CANTO THIRD,
6099,CANTO THIRD,"While thus he brooded, music sweet"
6100,CANTO THIRD,Of border tunes was played to cheer
6101,CANTO THIRD,The footsteps of a quick retreat;
6102,CANTO THIRD,"But Norton lingered in the rear,"
6103,CANTO THIRD,Stung with sharp thoughts; and ere the last                300
6104,CANTO THIRD,"From his distracted brain was cast,"
6105,CANTO THIRD,"Before his Father, Francis stood,"
6106,CANTO THIRD,And spake in firm and earnest mood.[95]
6107,CANTO THIRD,
6108,CANTO THIRD,"""Though here I bend a suppliant knee"
6109,CANTO THIRD,"In reverence, and unarmed, I bear                          305"
6110,CANTO THIRD,In your indignant thoughts my share;
6111,CANTO THIRD,Am grieved this backward march to see
6112,CANTO THIRD,So careless and disorderly.
6113,CANTO THIRD,"I scorn your Chiefs--men who would lead,"
6114,CANTO THIRD,And yet want courage at their need:                        310
6115,CANTO THIRD,Then look at them with open eyes!
6116,CANTO THIRD,Deserve they further sacrifice?--
6117,CANTO THIRD,"If--when they shrink, nor dare oppose"
6118,CANTO THIRD,"In open field their gathering foes,"
6119,CANTO THIRD,"(And fast, from this decisive day,                         315"
6120,CANTO THIRD,Yon multitude must melt away;)
6121,CANTO THIRD,If now I ask a grace not claimed
6122,CANTO THIRD,While ground was left for hope; unblamed
6123,CANTO THIRD,Be an endeavour that can do
6124,CANTO THIRD,No injury to them or you.[96]                              320
6125,CANTO THIRD,My Father! I would help to find
6126,CANTO THIRD,"A place of shelter, till the rage"
6127,CANTO THIRD,Of cruel men do like the wind
6128,CANTO THIRD,Exhaust itself and sink to rest;
6129,CANTO THIRD,Be Brother now to Brother joined!                          325
6130,CANTO THIRD,Admit me in the equipage
6131,CANTO THIRD,"Of your misfortunes, that at least,"
6132,CANTO THIRD,"Whatever fate remain[97] behind,"
6133,CANTO THIRD,I may bear witness in my breast
6134,CANTO THIRD,"To your nobility of mind!""                                 330"
6135,CANTO THIRD,
6136,CANTO THIRD,"""Thou Enemy, my bane and blight!"
6137,CANTO THIRD,Oh! bold to fight the Coward's fight
6138,CANTO THIRD,"Against all good""--but why declare,"
6139,CANTO THIRD,"At length, the issue of a prayer"
6140,CANTO THIRD,"Which love had prompted, yielding scope                    335"
6141,CANTO THIRD,Too free to one bright moment's hope?[98]
6142,CANTO THIRD,"Suffice it that the Son, who strove"
6143,CANTO THIRD,With fruitless effort to allay
6144,CANTO THIRD,"That passion, prudently gave way;[99]"
6145,CANTO THIRD,Nor did he turn aside to prove                             340
6146,CANTO THIRD,His Brothers' wisdom or their love--
6147,CANTO THIRD,But calmly from the spot withdrew;
6148,CANTO THIRD,"His best endeavours[100] to renew,"
6149,CANTO THIRD,Should e'er a kindlier time ensue.
6150,CANTO THIRD,
6151,CANTO THIRD,
6152,CANTO FOURTH,CANTO FOURTH
6153,CANTO FOURTH,
6154,CANTO FOURTH,"'Tis night: in silence looking down,"
6155,CANTO FOURTH,"The Moon, from cloudless ether, sees[101]"
6156,CANTO FOURTH,"A Camp, and a beleaguered Town,"
6157,CANTO FOURTH,And Castle like a stately crown
6158,CANTO FOURTH,On the steep rocks of winding Tees;--                        5
6159,CANTO FOURTH,"And southward far, with moor between,"
6160,CANTO FOURTH,"Hill-top, and flood, and forest green,[102]"
6161,CANTO FOURTH,The bright Moon sees that valley small
6162,CANTO FOURTH,Where Rylstone's old sequestered Hall
6163,CANTO FOURTH,A venerable image yields                                    10
6164,CANTO FOURTH,Of quiet to the neighbouring fields;
6165,CANTO FOURTH,While from one pillared chimney breathes
6166,CANTO FOURTH,"The smoke, and mounts in silver wreaths.[103]"
6167,CANTO FOURTH,--The courts are hushed;--for timely sleep
6168,CANTO FOURTH,The grey-hounds to their kennel creep;                      15
6169,CANTO FOURTH,The peacock in the broad ash tree
6170,CANTO FOURTH,"Aloft is roosted for the night,"
6171,CANTO FOURTH,He who in proud prosperity
6172,CANTO FOURTH,Of colours manifold and bright
6173,CANTO FOURTH,"Walked round, affronting the daylight;                      20"
6174,CANTO FOURTH,"And higher still, above the bower"
6175,CANTO FOURTH,"Where he is perched, from yon lone Tower"
6176,CANTO FOURTH,The hall-clock in the clear moonshine
6177,CANTO FOURTH,With glittering finger points at nine.
6178,CANTO FOURTH,
6179,CANTO FOURTH,Ah! who could think that sadness here                     25
6180,CANTO FOURTH,"Hath[104] any sway? or pain, or fear?"
6181,CANTO FOURTH,A soft and lulling sound is heard
6182,CANTO FOURTH,Of streams inaudible by day;[JJ]
6183,CANTO FOURTH,"The garden pool's dark surface, stirred"
6184,CANTO FOURTH,"By the night insects in their play,                         30"
6185,CANTO FOURTH,Breaks into dimples small and bright;
6186,CANTO FOURTH,"A thousand, thousand rings of light"
6187,CANTO FOURTH,That shape themselves and disappear
6188,CANTO FOURTH,Almost as soon as seen:--and lo!
6189,CANTO FOURTH,"Not distant far, the milk-white Doe--                       35"
6190,CANTO FOURTH,The same who quietly was feeding
6191,CANTO FOURTH,"On the green herb, and nothing heeding,"
6192,CANTO FOURTH,"When Francis, uttering to the Maid[105]"
6193,CANTO FOURTH,"His last words in the yew-tree shade,"
6194,CANTO FOURTH,Involved whate'er by love was brought                       40
6195,CANTO FOURTH,"Out of his heart, or crossed his thought,"
6196,CANTO FOURTH,"Or chance presented to his eye,"
6197,CANTO FOURTH,In one sad sweep of destiny--[106]
6198,CANTO FOURTH,"The same fair Creature, who hath found"
6199,CANTO FOURTH,Her way into forbidden ground;                              45
6200,CANTO FOURTH,Where now--within this spacious plot
6201,CANTO FOURTH,"For pleasure made, a goodly spot,"
6202,CANTO FOURTH,"With lawns and beds of flowers, and shades"
6203,CANTO FOURTH,"Of trellis-work in long arcades,"
6204,CANTO FOURTH,And cirque and crescent framed by wall                      50
6205,CANTO FOURTH,"Of close-clipt foliage green and tall,"
6206,CANTO FOURTH,"Converging walks, and fountains gay,"
6207,CANTO FOURTH,And terraces in trim array--
6208,CANTO FOURTH,"Beneath yon cypress spiring high,"
6209,CANTO FOURTH,With pine and cedar spreading wide                          55
6210,CANTO FOURTH,"Their darksome boughs on either side,"
6211,CANTO FOURTH,In open moonlight doth she lie;
6212,CANTO FOURTH,"Happy as others of her kind,"
6213,CANTO FOURTH,"That, far from human neighbourhood,"
6214,CANTO FOURTH,"Range unrestricted as the wind,                             60"
6215,CANTO FOURTH,"Through park, or chase, or savage wood."
6216,CANTO FOURTH,
6217,CANTO FOURTH,But see the consecrated Maid
6218,CANTO FOURTH,Emerging from a cedar shade[107]
6219,CANTO FOURTH,"To open moonshine, where the Doe"
6220,CANTO FOURTH,Beneath the cypress-spire is laid;                          65
6221,CANTO FOURTH,Like a patch of April snow--
6222,CANTO FOURTH,"Upon a bed of herbage green,"
6223,CANTO FOURTH,Lingering in a woody glade
6224,CANTO FOURTH,Or behind a rocky screen--
6225,CANTO FOURTH,"Lonely relic! which, if seen                                70"
6226,CANTO FOURTH,"By the shepherd, is passed by"
6227,CANTO FOURTH,With an inattentive eye.
6228,CANTO FOURTH,Nor more regard doth She bestow
6229,CANTO FOURTH,Upon the uncomplaining Doe[108]
6230,CANTO FOURTH,"Now couched at ease, though oft this day                    75"
6231,CANTO FOURTH,"Not unperplexed nor free from pain,"
6232,CANTO FOURTH,"When she had tried, and tried in vain,"
6233,CANTO FOURTH,"Approaching in her gentle way,"
6234,CANTO FOURTH,"To win some look of love, or gain"
6235,CANTO FOURTH,Encouragement to sport or play;                             80
6236,CANTO FOURTH,Attempts which still the heart-sick Maid
6237,CANTO FOURTH,"Rejected, or with slight repaid.[109]"
6238,CANTO FOURTH,
6239,CANTO FOURTH,Yet Emily is soothed;--the breeze
6240,CANTO FOURTH,Came fraught with kindly sympathies.
6241,CANTO FOURTH,As she approached yon rustic Shed[110]                      85
6242,CANTO FOURTH,"Hung with late-flowering woodbine, spread"
6243,CANTO FOURTH,"Along the walls and overhead,"
6244,CANTO FOURTH,The fragrance of the breathing flowers
6245,CANTO FOURTH,Revived[111] a memory of those hours
6246,CANTO FOURTH,"When here, in this remote alcove,                           90"
6247,CANTO FOURTH,(While from the pendent woodbine came
6248,CANTO FOURTH,"Like odours, sweet as if the same)"
6249,CANTO FOURTH,A fondly-anxious Mother strove
6250,CANTO FOURTH,To teach her salutary fears
6251,CANTO FOURTH,And mysteries above her years.                              95
6252,CANTO FOURTH,"Yes, she is soothed: an Image faint,"
6253,CANTO FOURTH,And yet not faint--a presence bright
6254,CANTO FOURTH,Returns to her--that bless√®d Saint[112]
6255,CANTO FOURTH,Who with mild looks and language mild
6256,CANTO FOURTH,"Instructed here her darling Child,                         100"
6257,CANTO FOURTH,"While yet a prattler on the knee,"
6258,CANTO FOURTH,To worship in simplicity
6259,CANTO FOURTH,"The invisible God, and take for guide"
6260,CANTO FOURTH,The faith reformed and purified.
6261,CANTO FOURTH,
6262,CANTO FOURTH,"'Tis flown--the Vision, and the sense                    105"

6280,CANTO FOURTH,Perturbed she issues. She will go!

6495,CANTO FIFTH,"And said--'We need not stop, my Son!                        95"
6496,CANTO FIFTH,"Thoughts press, and time is hurrying on'--[142]"
6497,CANTO FIFTH,And so to Francis he renewed
6498,CANTO FIFTH,"His words, more calmly thus pursued."
6499,CANTO FIFTH,
6500,CANTO FIFTH,"""'Might this our enterprise have sped,"
6501,CANTO FIFTH,"Change wide and deep the Land had seen,                    100"
6502,CANTO FIFTH,"A renovation from the dead,"
6503,CANTO FIFTH,A spring-tide of immortal green:
6504,CANTO FIFTH,The darksome altars would have blazed
6505,CANTO FIFTH,Like stars when clouds are rolled away;
6506,CANTO FIFTH,"Salvation to all eyes that gazed,                          105"
6507,CANTO FIFTH,Once more the Rood had been upraised
6508,CANTO FIFTH,"To spread its arms, and stand for aye."
6509,CANTO FIFTH,"Then, then--had I survived to see"
6510,CANTO FIFTH,New life in Bolton Priory;
6511,CANTO FIFTH,"The voice restored, the eye of Truth                       110"
6512,CANTO FIFTH,Re-opened that inspired my youth;
6513,CANTO FIFTH,To see[143] her in her pomp arrayed--
6514,CANTO FIFTH,This Banner (for such vow I made)
6515,CANTO FIFTH,Should on the consecrated breast
6516,CANTO FIFTH,Of that same Temple have found rest:                       115
6517,CANTO FIFTH,"I would myself have hung it high,"
6518,CANTO FIFTH,Fit[144] offering of glad victory!
6519,CANTO FIFTH,
6520,CANTO FIFTH,"""'A shadow of such thought remains"
6521,CANTO FIFTH,To cheer this sad and pensive time;
6522,CANTO FIFTH,A solemn fancy yet sustains                                120
6523,CANTO FIFTH,One feeble Being--bids me climb
6524,CANTO FIFTH,Even to the last--one effort more
6525,CANTO FIFTH,"To attest my Faith, if not restore."
6526,CANTO FIFTH,
6527,CANTO FIFTH,"""'Hear then,' said he, 'while I impart,"
6528,CANTO FIFTH,"My Son, the last wish of my heart.                         125"
6529,CANTO FIFTH,The Banner strive thou to regain;
6530,CANTO FIFTH,"And, if the endeavour prove not[145] vain,"
6531,CANTO FIFTH,Bear it--to whom if not to thee
6532,CANTO FIFTH,Shall I this lonely thought consign?--
6533,CANTO FIFTH,"Bear it to Bolton Priory,                                  130"
6534,CANTO FIFTH,And lay it on Saint Mary's shrine;
6535,CANTO FIFTH,To wither in the sun and breeze
6536,CANTO FIFTH,'Mid those decaying sanctities.
6537,CANTO FIFTH,"There let at least the gift be laid,"
6538,CANTO FIFTH,The testimony there displayed;                             135
6539,CANTO FIFTH,"Bold proof that with no selfish aim,"
6540,CANTO FIFTH,"But for lost Faith and Christ's dear name,"
6541,CANTO FIFTH,"I helmeted a brow though white,"
6542,CANTO FIFTH,And took a place in all men's sight;
6543,CANTO FIFTH,"Yea offered up this noble[146] Brood,                      140"
6544,CANTO FIFTH,"This fair unrivalled Brotherhood,"
6545,CANTO FIFTH,"And turned away from thee, my Son!"
6546,CANTO FIFTH,"And left--but be the rest unsaid,"
6547,CANTO FIFTH,"The name untouched, the tear unshed;--"
6548,CANTO FIFTH,"My wish is known, and I have done:                         145"
6549,CANTO FIFTH,"Now promise, grant this one request,"
6550,CANTO FIFTH,"This dying prayer, and be thou blest!'"
6551,CANTO FIFTH,
6552,CANTO FIFTH,"""Then Francis answered--'Trust thy Son,"
6553,CANTO FIFTH,"For, with God's will, it shall be done!'--[147]"
6554,CANTO FIFTH,
6555,CANTO FIFTH,"""The pledge obtained, the solemn word[148]               150"
6556,CANTO FIFTH,"Thus scarcely given, a noise was heard,"
6557,CANTO FIFTH,And Officers appeared in state
6558,CANTO FIFTH,To lead the prisoners to their fate.
6559,CANTO FIFTH,"They rose, oh! wherefore should I fear"
6560,CANTO FIFTH,"To tell, or, Lady, you to hear?                            155"
6561,CANTO FIFTH,They rose--embraces none were given--
6562,CANTO FIFTH,They stood like trees when earth and heaven
6563,CANTO FIFTH,"Are calm; they knew each other's worth,"
6564,CANTO FIFTH,And reverently the Band went forth.
6565,CANTO FIFTH,"They met, when they had reached the door,                  160"
6566,CANTO FIFTH,One with profane and harsh intent
6567,CANTO FIFTH,Placed there--that he might go before
6568,CANTO FIFTH,"And, with that rueful Banner borne"
6569,CANTO FIFTH,"Aloft in sign of taunting scorn,[149]"
6570,CANTO FIFTH,Conduct them to their punishment:                          165
6571,CANTO FIFTH,"So cruel Sussex, unrestrained"
6572,CANTO FIFTH,"By human feeling, had ordained."
6573,CANTO FIFTH,"The unhappy Banner Francis saw,"
6574,CANTO FIFTH,"And, with a look of calm command"
6575,CANTO FIFTH,"Inspiring universal awe,                                   170"
6576,CANTO FIFTH,He took it from the soldier's hand;
6577,CANTO FIFTH,And all the people that stood round[150]
6578,CANTO FIFTH,Confirmed the deed in peace profound.
6579,CANTO FIFTH,--High transport did the Father shed
6580,CANTO FIFTH,"Upon his Son--and they were led,                           175"
6581,CANTO FIFTH,"Led on, and yielded up their breath;"
6582,CANTO FIFTH,"Together died, a happy death!--"
6583,CANTO FIFTH,"But Francis, soon as he had braved"
6584,CANTO FIFTH,"That insult, and the Banner saved,"
6585,CANTO FIFTH,Athwart the unresisting tide[151]                          180
6586,CANTO FIFTH,Of the spectators occupied
6587,CANTO FIFTH,"In admiration or dismay,"
6588,CANTO FIFTH,"Bore instantly[152] his Charge away."""
6589,CANTO FIFTH,
6590,CANTO FIFTH,"These things, which thus had in the sight"
6591,CANTO FIFTH,And hearing passed of Him who stood                        185
6592,CANTO FIFTH,"With Emily, on the Watch-tower height,"
6593,CANTO FIFTH,"In Rylstone's woeful neighbourhood,"
6594,CANTO FIFTH,He told; and oftentimes with voice
6595,CANTO FIFTH,Of power to comfort[153] or rejoice;
6596,CANTO FIFTH,"For deepest sorrows that aspire,                           190"
6597,CANTO FIFTH,"Go high, no transport ever higher."
6598,CANTO FIFTH,"""Yes--God is rich in mercy,"" said"
6599,CANTO FIFTH,"The old Man to the silent Maid,"
6600,CANTO FIFTH,"""Yet, Lady! shines, through this black night,"
6601,CANTO FIFTH,One star of aspect heavenly bright;[154]                   195
6602,CANTO FIFTH,Your Brother lives--he lives--is come
6603,CANTO FIFTH,Perhaps already to his home;
6604,CANTO FIFTH,"Then let us leave this dreary place."""
6605,CANTO FIFTH,"She yielded, and with gentle pace,"
6606,CANTO FIFTH,"Though without one uplifted look,                          200"
6607,CANTO FIFTH,To Rylstone-hall her way she took.
6608,CANTO FIFTH,
6609,CANTO FIFTH,
6610,CANTO SIXTH,CANTO SIXTH
6611,CANTO SIXTH,
6612,CANTO SIXTH,Why comes not Francis?--From the doleful City
6613,CANTO SIXTH,"He fled,--and, in his flight, could hear"
6614,CANTO SIXTH,The death-sounds of the Minster-bell:[155]
6615,CANTO SIXTH,That sullen stroke pronounced farewell
6616,CANTO SIXTH,"To Marmaduke, cut off from pity!                             5"
6617,CANTO SIXTH,To Ambrose that! and then a knell
6618,CANTO SIXTH,"For him, the sweet half-opened Flower!"
6619,CANTO SIXTH,For all--all dying in one hour!
6620,CANTO SIXTH,--Why comes not Francis? Thoughts of love
6621,CANTO SIXTH,Should bear him to his Sister dear                          10
6622,CANTO SIXTH,With the fleet motion of a dove;[156]
6623,CANTO SIXTH,"Yea, like a heavenly messenger"
6624,CANTO SIXTH,"Of speediest wing, should he appear.[157]"
6625,CANTO SIXTH,Why comes he not?--for westward fast
6626,CANTO SIXTH,Along the plain of York he past;                            15
6627,CANTO SIXTH,"Reckless of what impels or leads,"
6628,CANTO SIXTH,Unchecked he hurries on;--nor heeds
6629,CANTO SIXTH,"The sorrow, through the Villages,"
6630,CANTO SIXTH,Spread by triumphant cruelties[158]
6631,CANTO SIXTH,"Of vengeful military force,                                 20"
6632,CANTO SIXTH,And punishment without remorse.
6633,CANTO SIXTH,"He marked not, heard not, as he fled;"
6634,CANTO SIXTH,All but the suffering heart was dead
6635,CANTO SIXTH,"For him abandoned to blank awe,"
6636,CANTO SIXTH,"To vacancy, and horror strong:[159]                         25"
6637,CANTO SIXTH,"And the first object which he saw,"
6638,CANTO SIXTH,"With conscious sight, as he swept along--"
6639,CANTO SIXTH,It was the Banner in his hand!
6640,CANTO SIXTH,He felt--and made a sudden stand.
6641,CANTO SIXTH,
6642,CANTO SIXTH,He looked about like one betrayed:                        30
6643,CANTO SIXTH,What hath he done? what promise made?
6644,CANTO SIXTH,"Oh weak, weak moment! to what end"
6645,CANTO SIXTH,"Can such a vain oblation tend,"
6646,CANTO SIXTH,And he the Bearer?--Can he go
6647,CANTO SIXTH,"Carrying this instrument of woe,                            35"
6648,CANTO SIXTH,"And find, find any where, a right"
6649,CANTO SIXTH,To excuse him in his Country's sight?
6650,CANTO SIXTH,No; will not all men deem the change
6651,CANTO SIXTH,"A downward course, perverse and strange?"
6652,CANTO SIXTH,"Here is it;--but how? when? must she,                       40"
6653,CANTO SIXTH,"The unoffending Emily,"
6654,CANTO SIXTH,Again this piteous object see?
6655,CANTO SIXTH,
6656,CANTO SIXTH,"Such conflict long did he maintain,"
6657,CANTO SIXTH,Nor liberty nor rest could gain:[160]
6658,CANTO SIXTH,His own life into danger brought                            45
6659,CANTO SIXTH,"By this sad burden--even that thought,"
6660,CANTO SIXTH,"Exciting self-suspicion strong,"
6661,CANTO SIXTH,Swayed the brave man to his wrong.[161]
6662,CANTO SIXTH,And how--unless it were the sense
6663,CANTO SIXTH,"Of all-disposing Providence,                                50"
6664,CANTO SIXTH,Its will unquestionably shown--
6665,CANTO SIXTH,How has the Banner clung so fast
6666,CANTO SIXTH,"To a palsied, and unconscious hand;"
6667,CANTO SIXTH,Clung to the hand to which it passed
6668,CANTO SIXTH,Without impediment? And why                                 55
6669,CANTO SIXTH,"But that Heaven's purpose might be known,"
6670,CANTO SIXTH,"Doth now no hindrance meet his eye,"
6671,CANTO SIXTH,"No intervention, to withstand"
6672,CANTO SIXTH,Fulfilment of a Father's prayer
6673,CANTO SIXTH,"Breathed to a Son forgiven, and blest                       60"
6674,CANTO SIXTH,"When all resentments were at rest,"
6675,CANTO SIXTH,And life in death laid the heart bare?--
6676,CANTO SIXTH,"Then, like a spectre sweeping by,"
6677,CANTO SIXTH,Rushed through his mind the prophecy
6678,CANTO SIXTH,Of utter desolation made                                    65
6679,CANTO SIXTH,To Emily in the yew-tree shade:
6680,CANTO SIXTH,"He sighed, submitting will and power"
6681,CANTO SIXTH,To the stern embrace of that grasping hour.[162]
6682,CANTO SIXTH,"""No choice is left, the deed is mine--"
6683,CANTO SIXTH,"Dead are they, dead!--and I will go,                        70"
6684,CANTO SIXTH,"And, for their sakes, come weal or woe,"
6685,CANTO SIXTH,"Will lay the Relic on the shrine."""
6686,CANTO SIXTH,
6687,CANTO SIXTH,So forward with a steady will
6688,CANTO SIXTH,"He went, and traversed plain and hill;"
6689,CANTO SIXTH,And up the vale of Wharf his way                            75
6690,CANTO SIXTH,"Pursued;--and, at the dawn of day,"
6691,CANTO SIXTH,Attained a summit whence his eyes[163]
6692,CANTO SIXTH,Could see the Tower of Bolton rise.
6693,CANTO SIXTH,There Francis for a moment's space
6694,CANTO SIXTH,Made halt--but hark! a noise behind                         80
6695,CANTO SIXTH,Of horsemen at an eager pace!
6696,CANTO SIXTH,"He heard, and with misgiving mind."
6697,CANTO SIXTH,--'Tis Sir George Bowes who leads the Band:
6698,CANTO SIXTH,"They come, by cruel Sussex sent;"
6699,CANTO SIXTH,"Who, when the Nortons from the hand                         85"
6700,CANTO SIXTH,"Of death had drunk their punishment,"
6701,CANTO SIXTH,"Bethought him, angry and ashamed,"
6702,CANTO SIXTH,"How Francis, with the Banner claimed"
6703,CANTO SIXTH,"As his own charge, had disappeared,[164]"
6704,CANTO SIXTH,By all the standers-by revered.                             90
6705,CANTO SIXTH,His whole bold carriage (which had quelled
6706,CANTO SIXTH,"Thus far the Opposer, and repelled"
6707,CANTO SIXTH,"All censure, enterprise so bright"
6708,CANTO SIXTH,That even bad men had vainly striven
6709,CANTO SIXTH,Against that overcoming light)                              95
6710,CANTO SIXTH,"Was then reviewed, and prompt word given,"
6711,CANTO SIXTH,That to what place soever fled
6712,CANTO SIXTH,"He should be seized, alive or dead."
6713,CANTO SIXTH,
6714,CANTO SIXTH,The troop of horse have gained the height
6715,CANTO SIXTH,Where Francis stood in open sight.                         100
6716,CANTO SIXTH,"They hem him round--""Behold the proof,"""
6717,CANTO SIXTH,"They cried, ""the Ensign in his hand![165]"
6718,CANTO SIXTH,"_He_ did not arm, he walked aloof!"
6719,CANTO SIXTH,For why?--to save his Father's land;--
6720,CANTO SIXTH,"Worst Traitor of them all is he,                           105"
6721,CANTO SIXTH,"A Traitor dark and cowardly!"""
6722,CANTO SIXTH,
6723,CANTO SIXTH,"""I am no Traitor,"" Francis said,"
6724,CANTO SIXTH,"""Though this unhappy freight I bear;"
6725,CANTO SIXTH,And must not part with. But beware;--
6726,CANTO SIXTH,"Err not, by hasty zeal misled,[166]                        110"
6727,CANTO SIXTH,"Nor do a suffering Spirit wrong,"
6728,CANTO SIXTH,"Whose self-reproaches are too strong!"""
6729,CANTO SIXTH,At this he from the beaten road
6730,CANTO SIXTH,"Retreated towards a brake of thorn,"
6731,CANTO SIXTH,That[167] like a place of vantage showed;                  115
6732,CANTO SIXTH,"And there stood bravely, though forlorn."
6733,CANTO SIXTH,In self-defence with warlike brow[168]
6734,CANTO SIXTH,"He stood,--nor weaponless was now;"
6735,CANTO SIXTH,He from a Soldier's hand had snatched
6736,CANTO SIXTH,"A spear,--and, so protected, watched                       120"
6737,CANTO SIXTH,"The Assailants, turning round and round;"
6738,CANTO SIXTH,But from behind with treacherous wound
6739,CANTO SIXTH,A Spearman brought him to the ground.
6740,CANTO SIXTH,"The guardian lance, as Francis fell,"
6741,CANTO SIXTH,Dropped from him; but his other hand                       125
6742,CANTO SIXTH,"The Banner clenched; till, from out the Band,"
6743,CANTO SIXTH,"One, the most eager for the prize,"
6744,CANTO SIXTH,"Rushed in; and--while, O grief to tell!"
6745,CANTO SIXTH,"A glimmering sense still left, with eyes"
6746,CANTO SIXTH,Unclosed the noble Francis lay--                           130
6747,CANTO SIXTH,"Seized it, as hunters seize their prey;"
6748,CANTO SIXTH,But not before the warm life-blood
6749,CANTO SIXTH,"Had tinged more deeply, as it flowed,"
6750,CANTO SIXTH,"The wounds the broidered Banner showed,"
6751,CANTO SIXTH,"Thy fatal work, O Maiden, innocent as good![169]           135"
6752,CANTO SIXTH,
6753,CANTO SIXTH,Proudly the Horsemen bore away
6754,CANTO SIXTH,The Standard; and where Francis lay[170]
6755,CANTO SIXTH,"There was he left alone, unwept,"
6756,CANTO SIXTH,And for two days unnoticed slept.
6757,CANTO SIXTH,For at that time bewildering fear                          140
6758,CANTO SIXTH,"Possessed the country, far and near;"
6759,CANTO SIXTH,"But, on the third day, passing by"
6760,CANTO SIXTH,One of the Norton Tenantry
6761,CANTO SIXTH,Espied the uncovered Corse; the Man
6762,CANTO SIXTH,"Shrunk as he recognised the face,                          145"
6763,CANTO SIXTH,And to the nearest homesteads ran
6764,CANTO SIXTH,And called the people to the place.
6765,CANTO SIXTH,--How desolate is Rylstone-hall!
6766,CANTO SIXTH,This was the instant thought of all;
6767,CANTO SIXTH,And if the lonely Lady there                               150
6768,CANTO SIXTH,Should be; to her they cannot bear
6769,CANTO SIXTH,This weight of anguish and despair.
6770,CANTO SIXTH,"So, when upon sad thoughts had prest"
6771,CANTO SIXTH,"Thoughts sadder still, they deemed it best"
6772,CANTO SIXTH,"That, if the Priest should yield assent                    155"
6773,CANTO SIXTH,"And no one hinder their intent,[171]"
6774,CANTO SIXTH,"Then, they, for Christian pity's sake,"
6775,CANTO SIXTH,In holy ground a grave would make;
6776,CANTO SIXTH,And straightway[172] buried he should be
6777,CANTO SIXTH,In the Church-yard of the Priory.                          160
6778,CANTO SIXTH,
6779,CANTO SIXTH,"Apart, some little space, was made"
6780,CANTO SIXTH,The grave where Francis must be laid.
6781,CANTO SIXTH,In no confusion or neglect
6782,CANTO SIXTH,"This did they,--but in pure respect"
6783,CANTO SIXTH,That he was born of gentle blood;                          165
6784,CANTO SIXTH,And that there was no neighbourhood
6785,CANTO SIXTH,Of kindred for him in that ground:
6786,CANTO SIXTH,"So to the Church-yard they are bound,"
6787,CANTO SIXTH,Bearing the body on a bier;
6788,CANTO SIXTH,And psalms they sing--a holy sound                         170
6789,CANTO SIXTH,That hill and vale with sadness hear.[173]
6790,CANTO SIXTH,
6791,CANTO SIXTH,"But Emily hath raised her head,"
6792,CANTO SIXTH,And is again disquieted;
6793,CANTO SIXTH,"She must behold!--so many gone,"
6794,CANTO SIXTH,Where is the solitary One?                                 175
6795,CANTO SIXTH,"And forth from Rylstone-hall stepped she,"
6796,CANTO SIXTH,"To seek her Brother forth she went,"
6797,CANTO SIXTH,And tremblingly her course she bent
6798,CANTO SIXTH,Toward[174] Bolton's ruined Priory.
6799,CANTO SIXTH,"She comes, and in the vale hath heard                      180"
6800,CANTO SIXTH,The funeral dirge;--she sees the knot
6801,CANTO SIXTH,"Of people, sees them in one spot--"
6802,CANTO SIXTH,And darting like a wounded bird
6803,CANTO SIXTH,"She reached the grave, and with her breast"
6804,CANTO SIXTH,"Upon the ground received the rest,--                       185"
6805,CANTO SIXTH,"The consummation, the whole ruth"
6806,CANTO SIXTH,And sorrow of this final truth!
6807,CANTO SIXTH,
6808,CANTO SIXTH,
6809,CANTO SEVENTH,CANTO SEVENTH
6810,CANTO SEVENTH,
6811,CANTO SEVENTH,"""Powers there are"
6812,CANTO SEVENTH,That touch each other to the quick--in modes
6813,CANTO SEVENTH,"Which the gross world no sense hath to perceive,"
6814,CANTO SEVENTH,"No soul to dream of.""[OO]"
6815,CANTO SEVENTH,
6816,CANTO SEVENTH,"Thou Spirit, whose angelic hand"
6817,CANTO SEVENTH,"Was to the harp a strong command,"
6818,CANTO SEVENTH,Called the submissive strings to wake
6819,CANTO SEVENTH,"In glory for this Maiden's sake,"
6820,CANTO SEVENTH,"Say, Spirit! whither hath she fled                           5"
6821,CANTO SEVENTH,To hide her poor afflicted head?
6822,CANTO SEVENTH,What mighty forest in its gloom
6823,CANTO SEVENTH,Enfolds her?--is a rifted tomb
6824,CANTO SEVENTH,Within the wilderness her seat?
6825,CANTO SEVENTH,Some island which the wild waves beat--                     10
6826,CANTO SEVENTH,Is that the Sufferer's last retreat?
6827,CANTO SEVENTH,"Or some aspiring rock, that shrouds"
6828,CANTO SEVENTH,Its perilous front in mists and clouds?
6829,CANTO SEVENTH,"High-climbing rock, low[175] sunless dale,"
6830,CANTO SEVENTH,"Sea, desert, what do these avail?                           15"
6831,CANTO SEVENTH,Oh take her anguish and her fears
6832,CANTO SEVENTH,Into a deep[176] recess of years!
6833,CANTO SEVENTH,
6834,CANTO SEVENTH,'Tis done;--despoil and desolation
6835,CANTO SEVENTH,O'er Rylstone's fair domain have blown;[PP]
6836,CANTO SEVENTH,"Pools, terraces, and walks are sown[177]                    20"
6837,CANTO SEVENTH,"With weeds; the bowers are overthrown,"
6838,CANTO SEVENTH,"Or have given way to slow mutation,"
6839,CANTO SEVENTH,"While, in their ancient habitation"
6840,CANTO SEVENTH,The Norton name hath been unknown.
6841,CANTO SEVENTH,The lordly Mansion of its pride                             25
6842,CANTO SEVENTH,Is stripped; the ravage hath spread wide
6843,CANTO SEVENTH,"Through park and field, a perishing"
6844,CANTO SEVENTH,That mocks the gladness of the Spring!
6845,CANTO SEVENTH,"And, with this silent gloom agreeing,"
6846,CANTO SEVENTH,"Appears[178] a joyless human Being,                         30"
6847,CANTO SEVENTH,Of aspect such as if the waste
6848,CANTO SEVENTH,Were under her dominion placed.
6849,CANTO SEVENTH,"Upon a primrose bank, her throne"
6850,CANTO SEVENTH,"Of quietness, she sits alone;"
6851,CANTO SEVENTH,"[179]Among the ruins of a wood,                             35"
6852,CANTO SEVENTH,"Erewhile a covert bright and green,"
6853,CANTO SEVENTH,"And where full many a brave tree stood,"
6854,CANTO SEVENTH,"That used to spread its boughs, and ring"
6855,CANTO SEVENTH,With the sweet bird's carolling.
6856,CANTO SEVENTH,"Behold her, like a virgin Queen,                            40"
6857,CANTO SEVENTH,Neglecting in imperial state
6858,CANTO SEVENTH,"These outward images of fate,"
6859,CANTO SEVENTH,And carrying inward a serene
6860,CANTO SEVENTH,"And perfect sway, through many a thought"
6861,CANTO SEVENTH,"Of chance and change, that hath been brought                45"
6862,CANTO SEVENTH,"To the subjection of a holy,"
6863,CANTO SEVENTH,"Though stern and rigorous, melancholy!"
6864,CANTO SEVENTH,"The like authority, with grace"
6865,CANTO SEVENTH,"Of awfulness, is in her face,--"
6866,CANTO SEVENTH,There hath she fixed it; yet it seems                       50
6867,CANTO SEVENTH,To o'ershadow by no native right
6868,CANTO SEVENTH,"That face, which cannot lose the gleams,"
6869,CANTO SEVENTH,"Lose utterly the tender gleams,"
6870,CANTO SEVENTH,"Of gentleness and meek delight,"
6871,CANTO SEVENTH,And loving-kindness ever bright:                            55
6872,CANTO SEVENTH,Such is her sovereign mien:--her dress
6873,CANTO SEVENTH,"(A vest with woollen cincture tied,"
6874,CANTO SEVENTH,A hood of mountain-wool undyed)
6875,CANTO SEVENTH,"Is homely,--fashioned to express"
6876,CANTO SEVENTH,A wandering Pilgrim's humbleness.                           60
6877,CANTO SEVENTH,
6878,CANTO SEVENTH,"And she _hath_ wandered, long and far,"
6879,CANTO SEVENTH,Beneath the light of sun and star;
6880,CANTO SEVENTH,"Hath roamed in trouble and in grief,"
6881,CANTO SEVENTH,"Driven forward like a withered leaf,"
6882,CANTO SEVENTH,Yea like a ship at random blown                             65
6883,CANTO SEVENTH,To distant places and unknown.
6884,CANTO SEVENTH,But now she dares to seek a haven
6885,CANTO SEVENTH,Among her native wilds of Craven;
6886,CANTO SEVENTH,"Hath seen again her Father's roof,"
6887,CANTO SEVENTH,And put her fortitude to proof;                             70
6888,CANTO SEVENTH,"The mighty sorrow hath[180] been borne,"
6889,CANTO SEVENTH,And she is thoroughly forlorn:
6890,CANTO SEVENTH,"Her soul doth in itself stand fast,"
6891,CANTO SEVENTH,Sustained by memory of the past
6892,CANTO SEVENTH,And strength of Reason; held above                          75
6893,CANTO SEVENTH,The infirmities of mortal love;
6894,CANTO SEVENTH,"Undaunted, lofty, calm, and stable,"
6895,CANTO SEVENTH,And awfully impenetrable.
6896,CANTO SEVENTH,
6897,CANTO SEVENTH,"And so--beneath a mouldered tree,"
6898,CANTO SEVENTH,A self-surviving leafless oak                               80
6899,CANTO SEVENTH,By unregarded age from stroke
6900,CANTO SEVENTH,Of ravage saved--sate Emily.
6901,CANTO SEVENTH,"There did she rest, with head reclined,"
6902,CANTO SEVENTH,"Herself most like a stately flower,"
6903,CANTO SEVENTH,(Such have I seen) whom chance of birth                     85
6904,CANTO SEVENTH,"Hath separated from its kind,"
6905,CANTO SEVENTH,"To live and die in a shady bower,"
6906,CANTO SEVENTH,Single on the gladsome earth.
6907,CANTO SEVENTH,
6908,CANTO SEVENTH,"When, with a noise like distant thunder,"
6909,CANTO SEVENTH,A troop of deer came sweeping by;                           90
6910,CANTO SEVENTH,"And, suddenly, behold a wonder!"
6911,CANTO SEVENTH,"For One, among those rushing deer,[181]"
6912,CANTO SEVENTH,"A single One, in mid career"
6913,CANTO SEVENTH,"Hath stopped, and fixed her[182] large full eye"
6914,CANTO SEVENTH,Upon the Lady Emily;                                        95
6915,CANTO SEVENTH,"A Doe most beautiful, clear-white,"
6916,CANTO SEVENTH,"A radiant creature, silver-bright!"
6917,CANTO SEVENTH,
6918,CANTO SEVENTH,"Thus checked, a little while it stayed;"
6919,CANTO SEVENTH,A little thoughtful pause it made;
6920,CANTO SEVENTH,"And then advanced with stealth-like pace,                  100"
6921,CANTO SEVENTH,"Drew softly near her, and more near--"
6922,CANTO SEVENTH,Looked round--but saw no cause for fear;
6923,CANTO SEVENTH,"So to her feet the Creature came,[183]"
6924,CANTO SEVENTH,"And laid its head upon her knee,"
6925,CANTO SEVENTH,"And looked into the Lady's face,                           105"
6926,CANTO SEVENTH,"A look of pure benignity,"
6927,CANTO SEVENTH,And fond unclouded memory.
6928,CANTO SEVENTH,"It is, thought Emily, the same,"
6929,CANTO SEVENTH,The very Doe of other years!--
6930,CANTO SEVENTH,"The pleading look the Lady viewed,                         110"
6931,CANTO SEVENTH,"And, by her gushing thoughts subdued,"
6932,CANTO SEVENTH,She melted into tears--
6933,CANTO SEVENTH,"A flood of tears, that flowed apace,"
6934,CANTO SEVENTH,Upon the happy Creature's face.
6935,CANTO SEVENTH,
6936,CANTO SEVENTH,"Oh, moment ever blest! O Pair                            115"
6937,CANTO SEVENTH,"Beloved of Heaven, Heaven's chosen[184] care,"
6938,CANTO SEVENTH,This was for you a precious greeting;
6939,CANTO SEVENTH,And may it prove a fruitful meeting![185]
6940,CANTO SEVENTH,"Joined are they, and the sylvan Doe"
6941,CANTO SEVENTH,Can she depart? can she forego                             120
6942,CANTO SEVENTH,"The Lady, once her playful peer,"
6943,CANTO SEVENTH,And now her sainted Mistress dear?
6944,CANTO SEVENTH,And will not Emily receive
6945,CANTO SEVENTH,This lovely chronicler of things
6946,CANTO SEVENTH,"Long past, delights and sorrowings?                        125"
6947,CANTO SEVENTH,Lone Sufferer! will not she believe
6948,CANTO SEVENTH,The promise in that speaking face;
6949,CANTO SEVENTH,"And welcome, as a gift of grace,[186]"
6950,CANTO SEVENTH,The saddest thought the Creature brings?[187]
6951,CANTO SEVENTH,
6952,CANTO SEVENTH,"That day, the first of a re-union                        130"
6953,CANTO SEVENTH,"Which was to teem with high communion,"
6954,CANTO SEVENTH,"That day of balmy April weather,"
6955,CANTO SEVENTH,They tarried in the wood together.
6956,CANTO SEVENTH,"And when, ere fall of evening dew,"
6957,CANTO SEVENTH,"She from her[188] sylvan haunt withdrew,                   135"
6958,CANTO SEVENTH,The White Doe tracked with faithful pace
6959,CANTO SEVENTH,The Lady to her dwelling-place;
6960,CANTO SEVENTH,"That nook where, on paternal ground,"
6961,CANTO SEVENTH,"A habitation she had found,"
6962,CANTO SEVENTH,The Master of whose humble board                           140
6963,CANTO SEVENTH,Once owned her Father for his Lord;
6964,CANTO SEVENTH,"A hut, by tufted trees defended,"
6965,CANTO SEVENTH,Where Rylstone brook with Wharf is blended.[QQ]
6966,CANTO SEVENTH,
6967,CANTO SEVENTH,When Emily by morning light
6968,CANTO SEVENTH,"Went forth, the Doe stood there[189] in sight.             145"
6969,CANTO SEVENTH,She shrunk:--with one frail shock of pain
6970,CANTO SEVENTH,"Received and followed by a prayer,"
6971,CANTO SEVENTH,She saw the Creature once again;[190]
6972,CANTO SEVENTH,"Shun will she not, she feels, will bear;--"
6973,CANTO SEVENTH,"But, wheresoever she looked round,                         150"
6974,CANTO SEVENTH,All now was trouble-haunted ground;
6975,CANTO SEVENTH,And therefore now she deems it good
6976,CANTO SEVENTH,Once more this restless neighbourhood[191]
6977,CANTO SEVENTH,"To leave. Unwooed, yet unforbidden,"
6978,CANTO SEVENTH,"The White Doe followed up the vale,                        155"
6979,CANTO SEVENTH,"Up to another cottage, hidden"
6980,CANTO SEVENTH,In the deep fork of Amerdale;[RR]
6981,CANTO SEVENTH,And there may Emily restore
6982,CANTO SEVENTH,"Herself, in spots unseen before."
6983,CANTO SEVENTH,"--Why tell of mossy rock, or tree,                         160"
6984,CANTO SEVENTH,"By lurking Dernbrook's pathless side,[SS]"
6985,CANTO SEVENTH,Haunts of a strengthening amity
6986,CANTO SEVENTH,"That calmed her, cheered, and fortified?"
6987,CANTO SEVENTH,For she hath ventured now to read
6988,CANTO SEVENTH,"Of time, and place, and thought, and deed--                165"
6989,CANTO SEVENTH,Endless history that lies
6990,CANTO SEVENTH,In her silent Follower's eyes;
6991,CANTO SEVENTH,Who with a power like human reason
6992,CANTO SEVENTH,"Discerns the favourable season,"
6993,CANTO SEVENTH,"Skilled to approach or to retire,--                        170"
6994,CANTO SEVENTH,From looks conceiving her desire;
6995,CANTO SEVENTH,"From look, deportment, voice, or mien,"
6996,CANTO SEVENTH,That vary to the heart within.
6997,CANTO SEVENTH,If she too passionately wreathed[192]
6998,CANTO SEVENTH,"Her arms, or over-deeply breathed,                         175"
6999,CANTO SEVENTH,"Walked quick or slowly, every mood"
7000,CANTO SEVENTH,In its degree was understood;
7001,CANTO SEVENTH,"Then well may their accord be true,"
7002,CANTO SEVENTH,And kindliest[193] intercourse ensue.
7003,CANTO SEVENTH,--Oh! surely 'twas a gentle rousing                        180
7004,CANTO SEVENTH,When she by sudden glimpse espied
7005,CANTO SEVENTH,"The White Doe on the mountain browsing,"
7006,CANTO SEVENTH,Or in the meadow wandered wide!
7007,CANTO SEVENTH,"How pleased, when down the Straggler sank"
7008,CANTO SEVENTH,"Beside her, on some sunny bank!                            185"
7009,CANTO SEVENTH,"How soothed, when in thick bower enclosed,"
7010,CANTO SEVENTH,"They, like a nested pair, reposed!"
7011,CANTO SEVENTH,Fair Vision! when it crossed the Maid
7012,CANTO SEVENTH,"Within some rocky cavern laid,"
7013,CANTO SEVENTH,"The dark cave's portal gliding by,                         190"
7014,CANTO SEVENTH,White as whitest[194] cloud on high
7015,CANTO SEVENTH,Floating through the[195] azure sky.
7016,CANTO SEVENTH,--What now is left for pain or fear?
7017,CANTO SEVENTH,"That Presence, dearer and more dear,"
7018,CANTO SEVENTH,"While they, side by side, were straying,                   195"
7019,CANTO SEVENTH,"And the shepherd's pipe was playing,"
7020,CANTO SEVENTH,Did now a very gladness yield
7021,CANTO SEVENTH,"At morning to the dewy field,[196]"
7022,CANTO SEVENTH,And with a deeper peace endued
7023,CANTO SEVENTH,The hour of moonlight solitude.                            200
7024,CANTO SEVENTH,
7025,CANTO SEVENTH,"With her Companion, in such frame"
7026,CANTO SEVENTH,"Of mind, to Rylstone back she came;"
7027,CANTO SEVENTH,"And, ranging[197] through the wasted groves,"
7028,CANTO SEVENTH,"Received the memory of old loves,"
7029,CANTO SEVENTH,"Undisturbed and undistrest,                                205"
7030,CANTO SEVENTH,Into a soul which now was blest
7031,CANTO SEVENTH,"With a soft spring-day of holy,"
7032,CANTO SEVENTH,"Mild, and grateful, melancholy:[198]"
7033,CANTO SEVENTH,"Not sunless gloom or unenlightened,"
7034,CANTO SEVENTH,But by tender fancies brightened.                          210
7035,CANTO SEVENTH,
7036,CANTO SEVENTH,When the bells of Rylstone played
7037,CANTO SEVENTH,"Their sabbath music--""=God us ayde!=""[TT]"
7038,CANTO SEVENTH,That was the sound they seemed to speak;
7039,CANTO SEVENTH,Inscriptive legend which I ween
7040,CANTO SEVENTH,"May on those holy bells be seen,                           215"
7041,CANTO SEVENTH,That legend and her Grandsire's name;
7042,CANTO SEVENTH,And oftentimes the Lady meek
7043,CANTO SEVENTH,Had in her childhood read the same;
7044,CANTO SEVENTH,Words which she slighted at that day;
7045,CANTO SEVENTH,"But now, when such sad change was wrought,                 220"
7046,CANTO SEVENTH,"And of that lonely name she thought,"
7047,CANTO SEVENTH,"The bells of Rylstone seemed to say,"
7048,CANTO SEVENTH,"While she sate listening in the shade,"
7049,CANTO SEVENTH,"With vocal music, ""=God us ayde;="""
7050,CANTO SEVENTH,And all the hills were glad to bear                        225
7051,CANTO SEVENTH,Their part in this effectual prayer.
7052,CANTO SEVENTH,
7053,CANTO SEVENTH,Nor lacked she Reason's firmest power;
7054,CANTO SEVENTH,But with the White Doe at her side
7055,CANTO SEVENTH,"Up would she climb to Norton Tower,"
7056,CANTO SEVENTH,"And thence look round her far and wide,                    230"
7057,CANTO SEVENTH,"Her fate there measuring;--all is stilled,--"
7058,CANTO SEVENTH,The weak One hath subdued her heart;[199]
7059,CANTO SEVENTH,"Behold the prophecy fulfilled,"
7060,CANTO SEVENTH,"Fulfilled, and she sustains her part!"
7061,CANTO SEVENTH,But here her Brother's words have failed;                  235
7062,CANTO SEVENTH,Here hath a milder doom prevailed;
7063,CANTO SEVENTH,"That she, of him and all bereft,"
7064,CANTO SEVENTH,Hath yet this faithful Partner left;
7065,CANTO SEVENTH,This one Associate[200] that disproves
7066,CANTO SEVENTH,"His words, remains for her, and loves.                     240"
7067,CANTO SEVENTH,"If tears are shed, they do not fall"
7068,CANTO SEVENTH,"For loss of him--for one, or all;"
7069,CANTO SEVENTH,"Yet, sometimes, sometimes doth she weep"
7070,CANTO SEVENTH,Moved gently in her soul's soft sleep;
7071,CANTO SEVENTH,A few tears down her cheek descend                         245
7072,CANTO SEVENTH,For this her last and living Friend.
7073,CANTO SEVENTH,
7074,CANTO SEVENTH,"Bless, tender Hearts, their mutual lot,"
7075,CANTO SEVENTH,And bless for both this savage spot;
7076,CANTO SEVENTH,Which Emily doth sacred hold
7077,CANTO SEVENTH,For reasons dear and manifold--                            250
7078,CANTO SEVENTH,"Here hath she, here before her sight,"
7079,CANTO SEVENTH,"Close to the summit of this height,"
7080,CANTO SEVENTH,The grassy rock-encircled Pound[UU]
7081,CANTO SEVENTH,In which the Creature first was found.
7082,CANTO SEVENTH,So beautiful the timid Thrall                              255
7083,CANTO SEVENTH,(A spotless Youngling white as foam)
7084,CANTO SEVENTH,Her youngest Brother brought it home;
7085,CANTO SEVENTH,"The youngest, then a lusty boy,"
7086,CANTO SEVENTH,"Bore it, or led, to Rylstone-hall"
7087,CANTO SEVENTH,With heart brimful of pride and joy![201]                  260
7088,CANTO SEVENTH,
7089,CANTO SEVENTH,"But most to Bolton's sacred Pile,"
7090,CANTO SEVENTH,"On favouring nights, she loved to go;"
7091,CANTO SEVENTH,"There ranged through cloister, court, and aisle,"
7092,CANTO SEVENTH,Attended by the soft-paced Doe;
7093,CANTO SEVENTH,Nor feared she in the still moonshine[202]                 265
7094,CANTO SEVENTH,To look upon Saint Mary's shrine;[VV]
7095,CANTO SEVENTH,Nor on the lonely turf that showed
7096,CANTO SEVENTH,Where Francis slept in his last abode.
7097,CANTO SEVENTH,For that she came; there oft she sate
7098,CANTO SEVENTH,"Forlorn, but not disconsolate:[203]                        270"
7099,CANTO SEVENTH,"And, when she from the abyss returned"
7100,CANTO SEVENTH,"Of thought, she neither shrunk nor mourned;"
7101,CANTO SEVENTH,Was happy that she lived to greet
7102,CANTO SEVENTH,Her mute Companion as it lay
7103,CANTO SEVENTH,In love and pity at her feet;                              275
7104,CANTO SEVENTH,How happy in its[204] turn to meet
7105,CANTO SEVENTH,The[205] recognition! the mild glance
7106,CANTO SEVENTH,Beamed from that gracious countenance;
7107,CANTO SEVENTH,"Communication, like the ray"
7108,CANTO SEVENTH,"Of a new morning, to the nature                            280"
7109,CANTO SEVENTH,And prospects of the inferior Creature!
7110,CANTO SEVENTH,
7111,CANTO SEVENTH,"A mortal Song we sing,[206] by dower"
7112,CANTO SEVENTH,Encouraged of celestial power;
7113,CANTO SEVENTH,Power which the viewless Spirit shed
7114,CANTO SEVENTH,By whom we were first visited;                             285
7115,CANTO SEVENTH,"Whose voice we heard, whose hand and wings"
7116,CANTO SEVENTH,"Swept like a breeze the conscious strings,"
7117,CANTO SEVENTH,"When, left in solitude, erewhile"
7118,CANTO SEVENTH,"We stood before this ruined Pile,"
7119,CANTO SEVENTH,"And, quitting unsubstantial dreams,                        290"
7120,CANTO SEVENTH,Sang in this Presence kindred themes;
7121,CANTO SEVENTH,Distress and desolation spread

7125,CANTO SEVENTH,"Dire overthrow, and yet how high"
7126,CANTO SEVENTH,The re-ascent in sanctity!
7127,CANTO SEVENTH,From fair to fairer; day by day
7128,CANTO SEVENTH,A more divine and loftier way!
7129,CANTO SEVENTH,"Even such this bless√®d Pilgrim trod,                       300"
7130,CANTO SEVENTH,By sorrow lifted towards her God;
7131,CANTO SEVENTH,Uplifted to the purest sky
7132,CANTO SEVENTH,Of undisturbed mortality.
7133,CANTO SEVENTH,Her own thoughts loved she; and could bend
7134,CANTO SEVENTH,A dear look to her lowly Friend;                           305
7135,CANTO SEVENTH,There stopped; her thirst was satisfied
7136,CANTO SEVENTH,With what this innocent spring supplied:
7137,CANTO SEVENTH,"Her sanction inwardly she bore,"
7138,CANTO SEVENTH,And stood apart from human cares:
7139,CANTO SEVENTH,"But to the world returned no more,                         310"
7140,CANTO SEVENTH,Although with no unwilling mind
7141,CANTO SEVENTH,"Help did she give at need, and joined"
7142,CANTO SEVENTH,The Wharfdale peasants in their prayers.
7143,CANTO SEVENTH,"At length, thus faintly, faintly tied"

7147,CANTO SEVENTH,Rose to the God from whom it came!
7148,CANTO SEVENTH,--In Rylstone Church her mortal frame
7149,CANTO SEVENTH,Was buried by her Mother's side.                           320
7150,CANTO SEVENTH,
7151,CANTO SEVENTH,Most glorious sunset! and a ray
7152,CANTO SEVENTH,Survives--the twilight of this day--
7153,CANTO SEVENTH,In that fair Creature whom the fields
7154,CANTO SEVENTH,"Support, and whom the forest shields;"
7155,CANTO SEVENTH,"Who, having filled a holy place,                           325"
7156,CANTO SEVENTH,"Partakes, in her degree, Heaven's grace;"
7157,CANTO SEVENTH,And bears a memory and a mind
7158,CANTO SEVENTH,Raised far above the law of kind;[WW]
7159,CANTO SEVENTH,Haunting the spots with lonely cheer
7160,CANTO SEVENTH,Which her dear Mistress once held dear:                    330
7161,CANTO SEVENTH,Loves most what Emily loved most--
7162,CANTO SEVENTH,The enclosure of this church-yard ground;
7163,CANTO SEVENTH,"Here wanders like a gliding ghost,"
7164,CANTO SEVENTH,And every sabbath here is found;
7165,CANTO SEVENTH,Comes with the people when the bells                       335
7166,CANTO SEVENTH,"Are heard among the moorland dells,"
7167,CANTO SEVENTH,"Finds entrance through yon arch, where way"
7168,CANTO SEVENTH,Lies open on the sabbath-day;
7169,CANTO SEVENTH,Here walks amid the mournful waste
7170,CANTO SEVENTH,"Of prostrate altars, shrines defaced,                      340"
7171,CANTO SEVENTH,And floors encumbered with rich show
7172,CANTO SEVENTH,Of fret-work imagery laid low;
7173,CANTO SEVENTH,"Paces softly, or makes halt,"
7174,CANTO SEVENTH,"By fractured cell, or tomb, or vault;"

7180,CANTO SEVENTH,The pensive visitant is seen.                              350
7181,CANTO SEVENTH,There doth the gentle Creature lie
7182,CANTO SEVENTH,With those adversities unmoved;

7186,CANTO SEVENTH,"Subdued by outrage and decay,"
7187,CANTO SEVENTH,"Looks down upon her with a smile,"

7193,CANTO SEVENTH,"The following is the full text of the first ""note"" to _The White Doe of"

7195,CANTO SEVENTH,"that edition are printed in this, at the foot of the pages where they"
7196,CANTO SEVENTH,occur:--
7197,CANTO SEVENTH,
7198,CANTO SEVENTH,"""The Poem of _The White Doe of Rylstone_ is founded on a local"
7199,CANTO SEVENTH,"tradition, and on the Ballad in Percy's Collection, entitled _The"
7200,CANTO SEVENTH,Rising of the North_. The tradition is as follows: 'About this
7201,CANTO SEVENTH,"time,' not long after the Dissolution, 'a White Doe, say the aged"
7202,CANTO SEVENTH,"people of the neighbourhood, long continued to make a weekly"
7203,CANTO SEVENTH,"pilgrimage from Rylstone over the fells of Bolton, and was"
7204,CANTO SEVENTH,constantly found in the Abbey Church-yard during divine service;
7205,CANTO SEVENTH,after the close of which she returned home as regularly as the
7206,CANTO SEVENTH,rest of the congregation.'--Dr. WHITAKER'S _History of the Deanery
7207,CANTO SEVENTH,of Craven_.--Rylstone was the property and residence of the
7208,CANTO SEVENTH,"Nortons, distinguished in that ill-advised and unfortunate"
7209,CANTO SEVENTH,"Insurrection, which led me to connect with this tradition the"
7210,CANTO SEVENTH,"principal circumstances of their fate, as recorded in the Ballad"
7211,CANTO SEVENTH,which I have thought it proper to annex.
7212,CANTO SEVENTH,
7213,CANTO SEVENTH,_The Rising in the North._
7214,CANTO SEVENTH,
7215,CANTO SEVENTH,"""The subject of this ballad is the great Northern Insurrection in"
7216,CANTO SEVENTH,"the 12th year of Elizabeth, 1569, which proved so fatal to Thomas"
7217,CANTO SEVENTH,"Percy, the seventh Earl of Northumberland."
7218,CANTO SEVENTH,
7219,CANTO SEVENTH,"""There had not long before been a secret negociation entered into"
7220,CANTO SEVENTH,"between some of the Scottish and English nobility, to bring about"
7221,CANTO SEVENTH,"a marriage between Mary Q. of Scots, at that time a prisoner in"
7222,CANTO SEVENTH,"England, and the Duke of Norfolk, a nobleman of excellent"
7223,CANTO SEVENTH,character. This match was proposed to all the most considerable of
7224,CANTO SEVENTH,"the English nobility, and among the rest to the Earls of"
7225,CANTO SEVENTH,"Northumberland and Westmoreland, two noblemen very powerful in the"
7226,CANTO SEVENTH,North. As it seemed to promise a speedy and safe conclusion of the
7227,CANTO SEVENTH,"troubles in Scotland, with many advantages to the crown of"
7228,CANTO SEVENTH,"England, they all consented to it, provided it should prove"
7229,CANTO SEVENTH,agreeable to Queen Elizabeth. The Earl of Leicester (Elizabeth's
7230,CANTO SEVENTH,"favourite) undertook to break the matter to her, but before he"
7231,CANTO SEVENTH,"could find an opportunity, the affair had come to her ears by"
7232,CANTO SEVENTH,"other hands, and she was thrown into a violent flame. The Duke of"
7233,CANTO SEVENTH,"Norfolk, with several of his friends, was committed to the Tower,"
7234,CANTO SEVENTH,and summons were sent to the Northern Earls instantly to make
7235,CANTO SEVENTH,their appearance at court. It is said that the Earl of
7236,CANTO SEVENTH,"Northumberland, who was a man of a mild and gentle nature,[XX] was"
7237,CANTO SEVENTH,"deliberating with himself whether he should not obey the message,"
7238,CANTO SEVENTH,"and rely upon the Queen's candour and clemency, when he was forced"
7239,CANTO SEVENTH,"into desperate measures by a sudden report at midnight, Nov. 14,"
7240,CANTO SEVENTH,that a party of his enemies were come to seize his person. The
7241,CANTO SEVENTH,"Earl was then at his house at Topcliffe in Yorkshire. When, rising"
7242,CANTO SEVENTH,"hastily out of bed, he withdrew to the Earl of Westmoreland at"
7243,CANTO SEVENTH,"Brancepeth, where the country came in to them, and pressed them to"
7244,CANTO SEVENTH,take up arms in their own defence. They accordingly set up their
7245,CANTO SEVENTH,"standards, declaring their intent was to restore the ancient"
7246,CANTO SEVENTH,"Religion, to get the succession of the crown firmly settled, and"
7247,CANTO SEVENTH,"to prevent the destruction of the ancient nobility, etc. Their"
7248,CANTO SEVENTH,"common banner (on which was displayed the cross, together with the"
7249,CANTO SEVENTH,"five wounds of Christ) was borne by an ancient gentleman, Richard"
7250,CANTO SEVENTH,"Norton, Esquire, who, with his sons (among whom, Christopher,"
7251,CANTO SEVENTH,"Marmaduke, and Thomas, are expressly named by Camden),"
7252,CANTO SEVENTH,"distinguished himself on this occasion. Having entered Durham,"
7253,CANTO SEVENTH,"they tore the Bible, etc., and caused mass to be said there; they"
7254,CANTO SEVENTH,"then marched on to Clifford-moor near Wetherby, where they"
7255,CANTO SEVENTH,"mustered their men.... The two Earls, who spent their large"
7256,CANTO SEVENTH,"estates in hospitality, and were extremely beloved on that"
7257,CANTO SEVENTH,"account, were masters of little ready money; the E. of"
7258,CANTO SEVENTH,"Northumberland bringing with him only 8000 crowns, and the E. of"
7259,CANTO SEVENTH,"Westmoreland nothing at all, for the subsistence of their forces,"
7260,CANTO SEVENTH,"they were not able to march to London, as they had at first"
7261,CANTO SEVENTH,"intended. In these circumstances, Westmoreland began so visibly to"
7262,CANTO SEVENTH,"despond, that many of his men slunk away, though Northumberland"
7263,CANTO SEVENTH,"still kept up his resolution, and was master of the field till"
7264,CANTO SEVENTH,"December 13, when the Earl of Sussex, accompanied with Lord"
7265,CANTO SEVENTH,"Hunsden and others, having marched out of York at the head of a"
7266,CANTO SEVENTH,"large body of forces, and being followed by a still larger army"
7267,CANTO SEVENTH,"under the command of Ambrose Dudley, Earl of Warwick, the"
7268,CANTO SEVENTH,"insurgents retreated northward towards the borders, and there"
7269,CANTO SEVENTH,"dismissing their followers, made their escape into Scotland."
7270,CANTO SEVENTH,Though this insurrection had been suppressed with so little
7271,CANTO SEVENTH,"bloodshed, the Earl of Sussex and Sir George Bowes, marshal of the"
7272,CANTO SEVENTH,"army, put vast numbers to death by martial law, without any"
7273,CANTO SEVENTH,regular trial. The former of these caused at Durham sixty-three
7274,CANTO SEVENTH,"constables to be hanged at once. And the latter made his boast,"
7275,CANTO SEVENTH,"that for sixty miles in length, and forty in breadth, betwixt"
7276,CANTO SEVENTH,"Newcastle and Wetherby, there was hardly a town or village wherein"
7277,CANTO SEVENTH,he had not executed some of the inhabitants. This exceeds the
7278,CANTO SEVENTH,cruelties practised in the West after Monmouth's rebellion.
7279,CANTO SEVENTH,
7280,CANTO SEVENTH,"""Such is the account collected from Stow, Speed, Camden, Guthrie,"
7281,CANTO SEVENTH,"Carte, and Rapin; it agrees, in most particulars, with the"
7282,CANTO SEVENTH,"following Ballad, apparently the production of some northern"
7283,CANTO SEVENTH,minstrel.--

7423,CANTO SEVENTH,"Those noble erles turned back againe,"

7425,CANTO SEVENTH,
7426,CANTO SEVENTH,"That baron he to his castle fled,"

7429,CANTO SEVENTH,The earles have wonne them presentlie.

7536,CANTO SEVENTH,_The White Doe of Rylstone_ has been assigned chronologically to the
7537,CANTO SEVENTH,year 1808; although part of it--probably the larger half--was written
7538,CANTO SEVENTH,"during the autumn of the previous year, and it remained unfinished in"
7539,CANTO SEVENTH,"1810, while the Dedication was not written till 1815. In the Fenwick"
7540,CANTO SEVENTH,"note, Wordsworth tells us that the ""earlier half"" was written at"
7541,CANTO SEVENTH,"Stockton-on-Tees ""at the close"" of 1807, and ""proceeded with"" at Dove"
7542,CANTO SEVENTH,"Cottage, after his return to Grasmere, which was in April 1808. But on"
7543,CANTO SEVENTH,"the 28th February, 1810, Dorothy Wordsworth, writing from Allan Bank to"
7544,CANTO SEVENTH,"Lady Beaumont, says, ""Before my brother turns to any other labour, I"
7545,CANTO SEVENTH,hope he will have finished three books of _The Recluse_. He seldom
7546,CANTO SEVENTH,writes less than 50 lines every day. After this task is finished he
7547,CANTO SEVENTH,"hopes to complete _The White Doe_, and proud should we all be if it"
7548,CANTO SEVENTH,should be honoured by a frontispiece from the pencil of Sir George

7550,CANTO SEVENTH,"next summer."""

7561,CANTO SEVENTH,"deeply than I wish to be affected; younger readers, however, will"
7562,CANTO SEVENTH,"not object to the depth of the distress, and nothing was ever more"
7563,CANTO SEVENTH,"ably treated. He is looking, too, for a narrative subject, pitched"

7565,CANTO SEVENTH,
7566,CANTO SEVENTH,One of the most interesting letters of S. T. Coleridge to Wordsworth is
7567,CANTO SEVENTH,"an undated one, sent from London in the spring of 1808, containing a"
7568,CANTO SEVENTH,characteristic criticism of _The White Doe_. The Wordsworth family had
7569,CANTO SEVENTH,asked Coleridge to discuss the subject of the publication of the poem
7570,CANTO SEVENTH,with the Longmans' firm. It is more than probable that it was
7571,CANTO SEVENTH,"Coleridge's criticism of the structural defects in the poem, that led"
7572,CANTO SEVENTH,Wordsworth to postpone its publication. The following is part of the
7573,CANTO SEVENTH,letter:--
7574,CANTO SEVENTH,
7575,CANTO SEVENTH,"""... In my reperusals of the poem, it seemed always to strike on"
7576,CANTO SEVENTH,"my feeling as well as judgment, that if there were any serious"
7577,CANTO SEVENTH,"defect, it consisted in a disproportion of the Accidents to the"
7578,CANTO SEVENTH,"spiritual Incidents; and, closely connected with this,--if it be"
7579,CANTO SEVENTH,"not indeed the same,--that Emily is indeed talked of, and once"
7580,CANTO SEVENTH,"appears, but neither speaks nor acts, in all the first"
7581,CANTO SEVENTH,"three-fourths of the poem. Then, as the outward interest of the"
7582,CANTO SEVENTH,"poem is in favour of the old man's religious feelings, and the"
7583,CANTO SEVENTH,"filial heroism of his band of sons, it seemed to require something"
7584,CANTO SEVENTH,in order to place the two protestant malcontents of the family in
7585,CANTO SEVENTH,"a light that made them beautiful as well as virtuous. In short, to"
7586,CANTO SEVENTH,"express it far more strongly than I mean or think, in order (in"
7587,CANTO SEVENTH,the present anguish of my spirits) to be able to express it at
7588,CANTO SEVENTH,"all, that three-fourths of the work is everything rather _than_"
7589,CANTO SEVENTH,"Emily; and then, the last--almost a separate and doubtless an"
7590,CANTO SEVENTH,"exquisite poem--wholly _of_ Emily. The whole of the rest, and the"
7591,CANTO SEVENTH,"delivering up of the family by Francis, I never ceased to find,"
7592,CANTO SEVENTH,"not only comparatively heavy, but to me quite obscure as to"
7593,CANTO SEVENTH,"Francis's motives. On the few, to whom, within my acquaintance,"
7594,CANTO SEVENTH,"the poem has been read, either by yourself or me (I have, I"
7595,CANTO SEVENTH,"believe, read it only at the Beaumonts'), it produced the same"
7596,CANTO SEVENTH,effect.
7597,CANTO SEVENTH,
7598,CANTO SEVENTH,"""Now I have conceived two little incidents, the introduction of"
7599,CANTO SEVENTH,"which, joined to a little abridgment, and lyrical precipitation of"
7600,CANTO SEVENTH,"the last half of the third, I had thought would have removed this"
7601,CANTO SEVENTH,"defect, so seeming to me, and bring to a finer balance the"
7602,CANTO SEVENTH,_business_ with the _action_ of the tale. But after my receipt of
7603,CANTO SEVENTH,"your letter, concerning Lamb's censures, I felt my courage fail,"
7604,CANTO SEVENTH,and that what I deemed a harmonizing would disgust you as a
7605,CANTO SEVENTH,"_materialization_ of the plan, and appear to you like"
7606,CANTO SEVENTH,insensibility to the power of the history in the mind. Not that I
7607,CANTO SEVENTH,should have shrunk back from the mere fear of giving transient
7608,CANTO SEVENTH,"pain, and a temporary offence, from the want of sympathy of"
7609,CANTO SEVENTH,feeling and coincidence of opinions. I rather envy than blame that
7610,CANTO SEVENTH,"deep interest in a production, which is inevitable perhaps, and"
7611,CANTO SEVENTH,certainly not dishonourable to such as feel poetry their calling
7612,CANTO SEVENTH,"and their duty, and which no man would find much fault with if the"
7613,CANTO SEVENTH,"object, instead of a poem, were a large estate or a title. It"
7614,CANTO SEVENTH,"appears to me to become a foible only when the poet denies, or is"
7615,CANTO SEVENTH,"unconscious of its existence, but I did not deem myself in such a"
7616,CANTO SEVENTH,state of mind as to entitle me to rely on my own opinion when
7617,CANTO SEVENTH,"opposed to yours, from the heat and bustle of these disgusting"
7618,CANTO SEVENTH,"lectures."""

7621,CANTO SEVENTH,
7622,CANTO SEVENTH,"""From most of these causes I was suffering, so as not to allow me"
7623,CANTO SEVENTH,"any rational confidence in my opinions when contrary to yours,"
7624,CANTO SEVENTH,which had been formed in calmness and on long reflection. Then I
7625,CANTO SEVENTH,"received your sister's letter, stating the wish that I would give"
7626,CANTO SEVENTH,"up the thought of proposing the means of correction, and merely"
7627,CANTO SEVENTH,"point out the things to be corrected, which--as they could be of"
7628,CANTO SEVENTH,"no great consequence--you might do in a day or two, and the"
7629,CANTO SEVENTH,publication of the poem--for the immediacy of which she expressed
7630,CANTO SEVENTH,great anxiety--be no longer retarded. The merely verbal
7631,CANTO SEVENTH,_alteranda_ did appear to me very few and trifling. From your
7632,CANTO SEVENTH,"letter on L----, I concluded that you would not have the incidents"
7633,CANTO SEVENTH,"and action interfered with, and therefore I sent it off; but soon"
7634,CANTO SEVENTH,"retracted it, in order to note down the single words and phrases"
7635,CANTO SEVENTH,"that I disliked in the books, after the two first, as there would"
7636,CANTO SEVENTH,be time to receive your opinion of them during the printing of the
7637,CANTO SEVENTH,"two first, in which I saw nothing amiss, except the one passage we"
7638,CANTO SEVENTH,"altered together, and the two lines which I scratched out, because"
7639,CANTO SEVENTH,you yourself were doubtful. Mrs. Shepherd told me that she had
7640,CANTO SEVENTH,"felt them exactly as I did--namely, as interrupting the spirit of"
7641,CANTO SEVENTH,"the continuous tranquil motion of _The White Doe_."""
7642,CANTO SEVENTH,
7643,CANTO SEVENTH,It will be seen from this letter that Wordsworth had gone over the poem
7644,CANTO SEVENTH,"with Coleridge, and that they had altered some passages ""together""; that"
7645,CANTO SEVENTH,"Coleridge had read a copy of it sent to the Beaumonts, doubtless at"
7646,CANTO SEVENTH,Dunmow in Essex; that he had thought of a plan by which the poem could
7647,CANTO SEVENTH,"be immensely improved, both by addition and subtraction; but that"
7648,CANTO SEVENTH,"hearing from Wordsworth, or more probably from his sister Dorothy, that"
7649,CANTO SEVENTH,"Charles Lamb had also criticised its structure, he gave up his intention"
7650,CANTO SEVENTH,"of sending to his friend suggestions, which evidently implied a radical"
7651,CANTO SEVENTH,"alteration of ""the incidents and action"" of the tale. It would have been"
7652,CANTO SEVENTH,extremely interesting to know how the author of _Christabel_ and _The
7653,CANTO SEVENTH,"Ancient Mariner_ proposed to recast _The White Doe of Rylstone_. It is,"
7654,CANTO SEVENTH,"alas! impossible for posterity to know this, although it is not"
7655,CANTO SEVENTH,difficult to conjecture the line which the alterations would take.
7656,CANTO SEVENTH,"Wordsworth's genius was not great in construction, as in imagination;"
7657,CANTO SEVENTH,"and he valued a story only as giving him a ""point of departure"" for a"
7658,CANTO SEVENTH,flight of fancy or of idealization. Early in 1808 he wrote to Walter
7659,CANTO SEVENTH,Scott asking him for facts about the Norton family. Scott supplied him
7660,CANTO SEVENTH,"with them, and the following was Wordsworth's reply."
7661,CANTO SEVENTH,
7662,CANTO SEVENTH,"""GRASMERE, May 14, 1808."
7663,CANTO SEVENTH,
7664,CANTO SEVENTH,"""MY DEAR SCOTT--Thank you for the interesting particulars about"
7665,CANTO SEVENTH,the Nortons. I like them much for their own sakes; but so far from
7666,CANTO SEVENTH,"being serviceable to my poem, they would stand in the way of it,"
7667,CANTO SEVENTH,as I have followed (as I was in duty bound to do) the traditionary
7668,CANTO SEVENTH,"and common historic account. Therefore I shall say, in this case,"
7669,CANTO SEVENTH,"a plague upon your industrious antiquarians, that have put my fine"
7670,CANTO SEVENTH,"story to confusion."""
7671,CANTO SEVENTH,
7672,CANTO SEVENTH,"From the ""advertisement"" which Wordsworth prefixed to his edition of"
7673,CANTO SEVENTH,"1815, I infer that the larger part of the poem was written at Stockton."
7674,CANTO SEVENTH,"In it he says that ""the Poem of _The White Doe_ was composed at the"
7675,CANTO SEVENTH,"close of the year"" (1807). This is an illustration of the vague manner"
7676,CANTO SEVENTH,"in which he was in the habit of assigning dates. The Fenwick note, and"
7677,CANTO SEVENTH,"the evidence of his sister's letter, is conclusive; although the fact"
7678,CANTO SEVENTH,that _The Force of Prayer_--written in 1807--is called in the Fenwick
7679,CANTO SEVENTH,"note ""an appendage to _The White Doe_,"" is further confirmation of the"
7680,CANTO SEVENTH,belief that the principal part of the latter poem was finished in 1807.
7681,CANTO SEVENTH,"All things considered, _The White Doe of Rylstone_ may be most"
7682,CANTO SEVENTH,"conveniently placed after the poems belonging to the year 1807, and"
7683,CANTO SEVENTH,before those known to have been written in 1808; while _The Force of
7684,CANTO SEVENTH,Prayer_ naturally follows it.
7685,CANTO SEVENTH,
7686,CANTO SEVENTH,The poem--first published in quarto in 1815--was scarcely altered in the
7687,CANTO SEVENTH,"editions of 1820, 1827, and 1832. In 1837, however, it was revised"
7688,CANTO SEVENTH,"throughout, and in that year the text was virtually settled; the"
7689,CANTO SEVENTH,"subsequent changes being few and insignificant, while those introduced"
7690,CANTO SEVENTH,in 1837 were numerous and important. A glance at the foot-notes will
7691,CANTO SEVENTH,"show that many passages were entirely rewritten in that year, and that a"
7692,CANTO SEVENTH,good many lines of the earlier text were altogether omitted. All the
7693,CANTO SEVENTH,"poems were subjected to minute revision in 1836-37; but few, if any,"
7694,CANTO SEVENTH,"were more thoroughly recast, and improved, in that year than _The White"
7695,CANTO SEVENTH,Doe of Rylstone_. As a sample of the best kind of changes--where a new
7696,CANTO SEVENTH,thought was added to the earlier text with admirable felicity--compare
7697,CANTO SEVENTH,"the lines in canto vii., as it stood in 1815, when the Lady Emily first"
7698,CANTO SEVENTH,"saw the White Doe at the old Hall of Rylstone, after her terrible losses"
7699,CANTO SEVENTH,and desolation--
7700,CANTO SEVENTH,
7701,CANTO SEVENTH,Lone Sufferer! will not she believe
7702,CANTO SEVENTH,"The promise in that speaking face,"
7703,CANTO SEVENTH,And take this gift of Heaven with grace?
7704,CANTO SEVENTH,
7705,CANTO SEVENTH,with the additional thought conveyed in the version of 1837--
7706,CANTO SEVENTH,
7707,CANTO SEVENTH,Lone Sufferer! will not she believe
7708,CANTO SEVENTH,The promise in that speaking face;
7709,CANTO SEVENTH,"And welcome, as a gift of grace,"
7710,CANTO SEVENTH,The saddest thought the Creature brings?
7711,CANTO SEVENTH,
7712,CANTO SEVENTH,"In the ""Reminiscences"" of Wordsworth--written by the Hon. Mr. Justice"
7713,CANTO SEVENTH,Coleridge for the late Bishop of Lincoln's _Memoirs_ of his uncle--the
7714,CANTO SEVENTH,"following occurs. (See vol. ii. p. 311.) ""His conversation was on"
7715,CANTO SEVENTH,"critical subjects, arising out of his attempts to alter his poems. He"
7716,CANTO SEVENTH,"said he considered _The White Doe_ as, in conception, the highest work"
7717,CANTO SEVENTH,he had ever produced. The mere physical action was all unsuccessful: but
7718,CANTO SEVENTH,"the true action of the poem was spiritual--the subduing of the will, and"
7719,CANTO SEVENTH,"all inferior fancies, to the perfect purifying and spiritualizing of the"
7720,CANTO SEVENTH,"intellectual nature; while the Doe, by connection with Emily, is raised"
7721,CANTO SEVENTH,as it were from its mere animal nature into something mysterious and
7722,CANTO SEVENTH,saint-like. He said he should devote much labour to perfecting the
7723,CANTO SEVENTH,"execution of it in the mere business parts, in which, from anxiety 'to"
7724,CANTO SEVENTH,"get on' with the more important parts, he was sensible that"
7725,CANTO SEVENTH,imperfections had crept in which gave the style a feebleness of
7726,CANTO SEVENTH,"character."""
7727,CANTO SEVENTH,
7728,CANTO SEVENTH,From this conversation--which took place in 1836--it will be seen that
7729,CANTO SEVENTH,Wordsworth knew very well that there were feeble passages in the earlier
7730,CANTO SEVENTH,"editions; and that, in the thorough revision which he gave to all his"
7731,CANTO SEVENTH,"poems in 1836-37, this one was specially singled out for ""much labour."""
7732,CANTO SEVENTH,The result is seen by a glance at the changes of the text.
7733,CANTO SEVENTH,
7734,CANTO SEVENTH,The notes appended by Wordsworth to the edition of 1815 explain some of
7735,CANTO SEVENTH,the historical and topographical allusions in the poem. To these the

7755,CANTO SEVENTH,"15 canons, over 200 persons (including servants and lay brethren) being"
7756,CANTO SEVENTH,supported at Bolton. During the Scottish raids of the fourteenth

7758,CANTO SEVENTH,safety. In 1542 the site of the priory and demesnes were sold to Harry

7840,CANTO SEVENTH,"Rylstone_, by the late Principal Shairp, in his _Aspects of Poetry_,"
7841,CANTO SEVENTH,from which the following passage is an extract (pp. 346-48).
7842,CANTO SEVENTH,
7843,CANTO SEVENTH,"""The incidents on which the _White Doe_ is founded belong to the"
7844,CANTO SEVENTH,"year 1569, the twelfth of Queen Elizabeth."
7845,CANTO SEVENTH,
7846,CANTO SEVENTH,"""It is well known that as soon as Queen Mary of Scotland was"
7847,CANTO SEVENTH,"imprisoned in England, she became the centre around which gathered"
7848,CANTO SEVENTH,"all the intrigues which were then on foot, not only in England but"
7849,CANTO SEVENTH,"throughout Catholic Europe, to dethrone the Protestant Queen"
7850,CANTO SEVENTH,"Elizabeth. Abroad, the Catholic world was collecting all its"
7851,CANTO SEVENTH,"strength to crush the heretical island. The bigot Pope, Pius V.,"
7852,CANTO SEVENTH,"with the dark intriguer, Philip II. of Spain, and the savage Duke"
7853,CANTO SEVENTH,"of Alva, were ready to pour their forces on the shores of England."
7854,CANTO SEVENTH,
7855,CANTO SEVENTH,"""At home, a secret negotiation for a marriage between Queen Mary"
7856,CANTO SEVENTH,and the Duke of Norfolk had received the approval of many of the
7857,CANTO SEVENTH,"chief English nobles. The Queen discovered the plot, threw Norfolk"
7858,CANTO SEVENTH,"and some of his friends into the Tower, and summoned Percy, Earl"
7859,CANTO SEVENTH,"of Northumberland, and Neville, Earl of Westmoreland, immediately"
7860,CANTO SEVENTH,to appear at court. These two earls were known to be holding
7861,CANTO SEVENTH,"secret communications with Mary, and longing to see the old faith"
7862,CANTO SEVENTH,restored.
7863,CANTO SEVENTH,
7864,CANTO SEVENTH,"""On receiving the summons, Northumberland at once withdrew to"
7865,CANTO SEVENTH,"Brancepeth Castle, a stronghold of the Earl of Westmoreland."
7866,CANTO SEVENTH,"Straightway all their vassals rose, and gathered round the two"
7867,CANTO SEVENTH,great earls. The whole of the North was in arms. A proclamation
7868,CANTO SEVENTH,"went forth that they intended to restore the ancient religion, to"
7869,CANTO SEVENTH,"settle the succession to the crown, and to prevent the destruction"
7870,CANTO SEVENTH,of the old nobility. As they marched forward they were joined by
7871,CANTO SEVENTH,"all the strength of the Yorkshire dales, and, among others, by a"
7872,CANTO SEVENTH,"gentleman of ancient name, Richard Norton, accompanied by eight"
7873,CANTO SEVENTH,"brave sons. He came bearing the common banner, called the Banner"
7874,CANTO SEVENTH,"of the Five Wounds, because on it was displayed the Cross with the"
7875,CANTO SEVENTH,"five wounds of our Lord. The insurgents entered Durham, tore the"
7876,CANTO SEVENTH,"Bible, caused mass to be said in the cathedral, and then set"
7877,CANTO SEVENTH,"forward as for York. Changing their purpose on the way, they"
7878,CANTO SEVENTH,"turned aside to lay siege to Barnard Castle, which was held by Sir"
7879,CANTO SEVENTH,George Bowes for the Queen. While they lingered there for eleven
7880,CANTO SEVENTH,"days, Sussex marched against them from York, and the earls, losing"
7881,CANTO SEVENTH,"heart, retired towards the Border, and disbanded their forces,"
7882,CANTO SEVENTH,"which were left to the vengeance of the enemy, while they"
7883,CANTO SEVENTH,"themselves sought refuge in Scotland. Northumberland, after a"
7884,CANTO SEVENTH,"confinement of several years in Loch Leven Castle, was betrayed by"
7885,CANTO SEVENTH,"the Scots to the English, and put to death. Westmoreland died an"
7886,CANTO SEVENTH,"exile in Flanders, the last of the ancient house of the Nevilles,"
7887,CANTO SEVENTH,"earls of Westmoreland. Norton, with his eight sons, fell into the"
7888,CANTO SEVENTH,"hands of Sussex, and all suffered death at York. It is the fate of"

8046,CANTO SEVENTH,"373-76). ""What is it that gives to it"" (the poem) ""its chief power and"
8047,CANTO SEVENTH,charm? Is it not the imaginative use which the poet has made of the
8048,CANTO SEVENTH,"White Doe? With her appearance the poem opens, with her re-appearance it"
8049,CANTO SEVENTH,closes. And the passages in which she is introduced are radiant with the
8050,CANTO SEVENTH,"purest light of poetry. A mere floating tradition she was, which the"
8051,CANTO SEVENTH,historian of Craven had preserved. How much does the poet bring out of
8052,CANTO SEVENTH,how little! It was a high stroke of genius to seize on this slight
8053,CANTO SEVENTH,"traditionary incident, and make it the organ of so much. What were the"
8054,CANTO SEVENTH,objects which he had to describe and blend into one harmonious whole.
8055,CANTO SEVENTH,They were these:
8056,CANTO SEVENTH,
8057,CANTO SEVENTH,"""1. The last expiring gleam of feudal chivalry, ending in the ruin of an"
8058,CANTO SEVENTH,"ancient race, and the desolation of an ancestral home."
8059,CANTO SEVENTH,
8060,CANTO SEVENTH,"""2. The sole survivor, purified and exalted by the sufferings she had to"
8061,CANTO SEVENTH,undergo.
8062,CANTO SEVENTH,
8063,CANTO SEVENTH,"""3. The pathos of the decaying sanctities of Bolton, after wrong and"
8064,CANTO SEVENTH,"outrage, abandoned to the healing of nature and time."
8065,CANTO SEVENTH,
8066,CANTO SEVENTH,"""4. Lastly, the beautiful scenery of pastoral Wharfdale, and of the"
8067,CANTO SEVENTH,"fells around Bolton, which blend so well with these affecting memories."
8068,CANTO SEVENTH,
8069,CANTO SEVENTH,"""All these were before him--they had melted into his imagination, and"
8070,CANTO SEVENTH,"waited to be woven into one harmonious creation. He takes the White Doe,"
8071,CANTO SEVENTH,"and makes her the exponent, the symbol, the embodiment of them all. The"
8072,CANTO SEVENTH,one central aim--to represent the beatification of the heroine--how was
8073,CANTO SEVENTH,"this to be attained? Had it been a drama, the poet would have made the"
8074,CANTO SEVENTH,"heroine give forth in speeches, her hidden mind and character. But this"
8075,CANTO SEVENTH,"was a romantic narrative. Was the poet to make her soliloquise, analyse"
8076,CANTO SEVENTH,"her own feelings, lay bare her heart in metaphysical monologue? This"
8077,CANTO SEVENTH,"might have been done by some modern poets, but it was not Wordsworth's"
8078,CANTO SEVENTH,"way of exhibiting character, reflective though he was. When he analyses"
8079,CANTO SEVENTH,"feelings they are generally his own, not those of his characters. To"
8080,CANTO SEVENTH,"shadow forth that which is invisible, the sanctity of Emily's chastened"
8081,CANTO SEVENTH,"soul, he lays hold of this sensible image--a creature, the purest, most"
8082,CANTO SEVENTH,"innocent, most beautiful in the whole realm of nature--and makes her the"
8083,CANTO SEVENTH,vehicle in which he embodies the saintliness which is a thing invisible.
8084,CANTO SEVENTH,"It is the hardest of all tasks to make spiritual things sensuous,"
8085,CANTO SEVENTH,without degrading them. I know not where this difficulty has been more
8086,CANTO SEVENTH,"happily met; for we are made to feel that, before the poem closes, the"
8087,CANTO SEVENTH,"Doe has ceased to be a mere animal, or a physical creature at all, but"
8088,CANTO SEVENTH,"in the light of the poet's imagination, has been transfigured into a"
8089,CANTO SEVENTH,"heavenly apparition--a type of all that is pure, and affecting, and"
8090,CANTO SEVENTH,"saintly. And not only the chastened soul of her mistress, but the"
8091,CANTO SEVENTH,"beautiful Priory of Bolton, the whole Vale of Wharfe, and all the"
8092,CANTO SEVENTH,"surrounding scenery, are illumined by the glory which she makes; her"
8093,CANTO SEVENTH,presence irradiates them all with a beauty and an interest more than the
8094,CANTO SEVENTH,"eye discovers. Seen through her as an imaginative transparency, they"
8095,CANTO SEVENTH,"become spiritualized; in fact, she and they alike become the symbol and"
8096,CANTO SEVENTH,expression of the sentiment which pervades the poem--a sentiment broad
8097,CANTO SEVENTH,"and deep as the world. And yet, any one who visits these scenes, in a"
8098,CANTO SEVENTH,"mellow autumnal day, will feel that she is no alien or adventitious"
8099,CANTO SEVENTH,"image, imported by the caprice of the poet, but altogether native to the"
8100,CANTO SEVENTH,"place, one which gathers up and concentrates all the undefined spirit"
8101,CANTO SEVENTH,and sentiment which lie spread around it. She both glorifies the scenery
8102,CANTO SEVENTH,"by her presence, and herself seems to be a natural growth of the"
8103,CANTO SEVENTH,"scenery, so that it finds in her its most appropriate utterance. This"
8104,CANTO SEVENTH,power of imagination to divine and project the very corporeal image
8105,CANTO SEVENTH,"which suits and expresses the image of a scene, Wordsworth has many"
8106,CANTO SEVENTH,times shown....
8107,CANTO SEVENTH,
8108,CANTO SEVENTH,"""And so the poem has no definite end, but passes off, as it were, into"
8109,CANTO SEVENTH,the illimitable. It rises out of the perturbations of time and
8110,CANTO SEVENTH,"transitory things, and, passing upward itself, takes our thoughts with"
8111,CANTO SEVENTH,"it to calm places and eternal sunshine.""--ED."

10373,FOOTNOTES:,"studied more in his walks over heath and field than in books, and"
10374,FOOTNOTES:,entered with interest into the questions affecting the good of the
10375,FOOTNOTES:,country people around him. All this of necessity impelled him to
10376,FOOTNOTES:,take a warm interest in the herdsmen of the Alps.
10377,FOOTNOTES:,
10378,FOOTNOTES:,"""But the Tyrolese inspired him with still greater interest on"
10379,FOOTNOTES:,"political grounds. Like all the lake poets, he was an enthusiastic"
10380,FOOTNOTES:,"admirer, not of the French revolution, but of the republic as long"
10381,FOOTNOTES:,"as it seemed to desire the realization of the ideas of Liberty,"
10382,FOOTNOTES:,"Fraternity, Equality, and the rest of Rousseau's Arcadian notions;"
10383,FOOTNOTES:,"and it was a bitter disillusion for him, as well as for Klopstock,"
10384,FOOTNOTES:,when this much-praised home of the free rights of man resolved
10385,FOOTNOTES:,itself into the empire of Napoleon. From this moment he took his
10386,FOOTNOTES:,"place on the side of the enemies of France, and particularly on"
10387,FOOTNOTES:,"the side of the Tyrolese, since they had never lost the natural"
10388,FOOTNOTES:,"simplicity of their habits, and had regained the hereditary"
10389,FOOTNOTES:,"freedom, of which they had been deprived, with the sword. Thus"
10390,FOOTNOTES:,"arose the curious paradox, that a republican poet glorified"
10391,FOOTNOTES:,spontaneously the cause of an exceedingly monarchical and
10392,FOOTNOTES:,conservative country.

10394,FOOTNOTES:,"""Wordsworth gave vent to his enthusiasm in six sonnets, which, as"
10395,FOOTNOTES:,"far as power of language and vigour of thought are concerned, form"
10396,FOOTNOTES:,interesting companion-pieces to the poems of the contemporary
10397,FOOTNOTES:,Tyrolese poet Alois Weissenbach. In the first three sonnets the
10398,FOOTNOTES:,"splendour of the Alpine world, which he knew from his journeys in"
10399,FOOTNOTES:,"Switzerland, forms the background of the picture. In the"
10400,FOOTNOTES:,"foreground he sees a band of brave and daring men, in whose hearts"
10401,FOOTNOTES:,he thought he could find all his own moral pathos. Many of the
10402,FOOTNOTES:,features which he has introduced certainly show more ideal fancy
10403,FOOTNOTES:,than knowledge of detail; but it was not his purpose to compose a
10404,FOOTNOTES:,"correct report of the war, but to give an exciting description of"
10405,FOOTNOTES:,"the heroes of this struggle for independence, in order that, even"
10406,FOOTNOTES:,"though they themselves should be overpowered, their spirit might"
10407,FOOTNOTES:,"arise again among his own fellow-countrymen. In the fourth sonnet,"
10408,FOOTNOTES:,"in his enthusiasm for the Tyrolese, he has treated the German"
10409,FOOTNOTES:,universities with unnecessary severity; but this does not prove
10410,FOOTNOTES:,"any intentional want of fairness on his part, for at that time our"
10411,FOOTNOTES:,universities stood under general discredit in England as the
10412,FOOTNOTES:,hotbeds of the wildest metaphysics and political dreams. The
10413,FOOTNOTES:,events of the year 1813 would probably induce Wordsworth to view
10414,FOOTNOTES:,them in a more favourable light. Similarly the sixth sonnet is not
10415,FOOTNOTES:,quite just to Austria; in particular Wordsworth has made
10416,FOOTNOTES:,decidedly too little allowance for the fact that the Emperor Franz
10417,FOOTNOTES:,I. ceded the Tyrol quite against his own will under the pressure
10418,FOOTNOTES:,of circumstances. But in this case we must not simply impute all
10419,FOOTNOTES:,the blame to the poet; for as we see from the diary of his friend
10420,FOOTNOTES:,"Southey, his information as to the doings of Austria was of a most"
