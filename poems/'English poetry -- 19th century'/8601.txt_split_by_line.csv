41,PREFACE,PREFACE
42,PREFACE,
43,PREFACE,A Critical edition of Tennyson's poems has long been an acknowledged
44,PREFACE,"want. He has taken his place among the English Classics, and as a"
45,PREFACE,"Classic he is, and will be, studied, seriously and minutely, by many"
46,PREFACE,"thousands of his countrymen, both in the present generation as well as"
47,PREFACE,"in future ages. As in the works of his more illustrious brethren, so in"
48,PREFACE,"his trifles will become subjects of curious interest, and assume an"
49,PREFACE,importance of which we have no conception now. Here he will engage the
50,PREFACE,"attention of the antiquary, there of the social historian. Long after"
51,PREFACE,"his politics, his ethics, his theology have ceased to be immediately"
52,PREFACE,"influential, they will be of immense historical significance. A"
53,PREFACE,"consummate artist and a consummate master of our language, the process"
54,PREFACE,by which he achieved results so memorable can never fail to be of
55,PREFACE,"interest, and of absorbing interest, to critical students."
56,PREFACE,
57,PREFACE,"I must, I fear, claim the indulgence due to one who attempts, for the"
58,PREFACE,"first time, a critical edition of a text so perplexingly voluminous in"
59,PREFACE,variants as Tennyson's. I can only say that I have spared neither time
60,PREFACE,"nor labour to be accurate and exhaustive. I have myself collated, or"
61,PREFACE,"have had collated for me, every edition recorded in the British Museum"
62,PREFACE,"Catalogue, and where that has been deficient I have had recourse to"
63,PREFACE,"other public libraries, and to the libraries of private friends. I am"
64,PREFACE,"not conscious that I have left any variant unrecorded, but I should not"
65,PREFACE,like to assert that this is the case. Tennyson was so restlessly
66,PREFACE,"indefatigable in his corrections that there may lurk, in editions of the"
67,PREFACE,"poems which I have not seen, other variants; and it is also possible"
68,PREFACE,"that, in spite of my vigilance, some may have escaped me even in the"
69,PREFACE,"editions which have been collated, and some may have been made at a date"
70,PREFACE,earlier than the date recorded. But I trust this has not been the case.
71,PREFACE,
72,PREFACE,Of the Bibliography I can say no more than that I have done my utmost to
73,PREFACE,"make it complete, and that it is very much fuller than any which has"
74,PREFACE,hitherto appeared. That it is exhaustive I dare not promise.
75,PREFACE,
76,PREFACE,"With regard to the Notes and Commentaries, I have spared no pains to"
77,PREFACE,"explain everything which seemed to need explanation. There are, I think,"
78,PREFACE,"only two points which I have not been able to clear up, namely, the name"
79,PREFACE,"of the friend to whom the 'Palace of Art' was addressed, and the name"
80,PREFACE,of the friend to whom the 'Verses after Reading a Life and Letters'
81,PREFACE,were addressed. I have consulted every one who would be likely to throw
82,PREFACE,"light on the subject, including the poet's surviving sister, many of his"
83,PREFACE,"friends, and the present Lord Tennyson, but without success; so the"
84,PREFACE,"names, if they were not those of some imaginary person, appear to be"
85,PREFACE,"irrecoverable. The Prize Poem, 'Timbuctoo', as well as the poems which"
86,PREFACE,were temporarily or finally suppressed in the volumes published in 1830
87,PREFACE,and 1832 have been printed in the Appendix: those which were
88,PREFACE,"subsequently incorporated in his Works, in large type; those which he"
89,PREFACE,"never reprinted, in small."
90,PREFACE,
91,PREFACE,"The text here adopted is that of 1857, but Messrs. Macmillan, to whom I"
92,PREFACE,"beg to express my hearty thanks, have most generously allowed me to"
93,PREFACE,record all the variants which are still protected by copyright. I have
94,PREFACE,"to thank them, too, for assistance in the Bibliography. I have also to"
95,PREFACE,thank Mr. J. T. Wise for his kindness in lending me the privately
96,PREFACE,"printed volume containing the 'Morte d'Arthur, Dora,' etc."

106,I,"The development of Tennyson's genius, methods, aims and capacity of"
107,I,achievement in poetry can be studied with singular precision and fulness
108,I,in the history of the poems included in the present volume. In 1842 he
109,I,"published the two volumes which gave him, by almost general consent, the"
110,I,"first place among the poets of his time, for, though Wordsworth was"
111,I,"alive, Wordsworth's best work had long been done. These two volumes"
112,I,"contained poems which had appeared before, some in 1830 and some in"
113,I,"1832, and some which were then given to the world for the first time, so"
114,I,"that they represent work belonging to three eras in the poet's life,"
115,I,poems written before he had completed his twenty-second year and
116,I,"belonging for the most part to his boyhood, poems written in his early"
117,I,"manhood, and poems written between his thirty-first and thirty-fourth"
118,I,year.

315,INTRODUCTION,
316,INTRODUCTION,"Only two of these poems had been published before, namely, 'St. Agnes',"
317,INTRODUCTION,"which was printed in 'The Keepsake' for 1837, and 'The Sleeping Beauty'"
318,INTRODUCTION,"in 'The Day Dream', which was adopted with some alterations from the"
319,INTRODUCTION,"1830 poem, and only one of these poems was afterwards suppressed, 'The"
320,INTRODUCTION,"Skipping Rope', which was, however, allowed to stand till 1851. In 1843"
321,INTRODUCTION,"appeared the second edition of these poems, which is merely a reprint"
322,INTRODUCTION,"with a few unimportant alterations, and which was followed in 1845 and"
323,INTRODUCTION,in 1846 by a third and fourth edition equally unimportant in their
324,INTRODUCTION,"variants, but in the fourth 'The Golden Year' was added. In the next"
325,INTRODUCTION,"edition, the fifth, 1848, 'The Deserted House' was included from the"
326,INTRODUCTION,"poems of 1830. In the sixth edition, 1850, was included another poem,"
327,INTRODUCTION,"'To--, after reading a Life and Letters', reprinted, with some"
328,INTRODUCTION,"alterations, from the 'Examiner' of 24th March, 1849."
329,INTRODUCTION,
330,INTRODUCTION,"The seventh edition, 1851, contained important additions. First the"
331,INTRODUCTION,"Dedication to the Queen, then 'Edwin Morris,' the fragment of 'The"
332,INTRODUCTION,"Eagle,' and the stanzas, ""Come not when I am dead,"" first printed in"
333,INTRODUCTION,"'The Keepsake' for 1851, under the title of 'Stanzas.' In this edition"
334,INTRODUCTION,the absurd trifle 'The Skipping Rope' was excised and finally cancelled.
335,INTRODUCTION,"In the eighth edition, 1853, 'The Sea-Fairies,' though greatly altered,"
336,INTRODUCTION,"was included from the poems of 1830, and the poem 'To E. L. on his"
337,INTRODUCTION,"Travels in Greece' was added. This edition, the eighth, may be regarded"
338,INTRODUCTION,as the final one. Nothing afterwards of much importance was added or
339,INTRODUCTION,"subtracted, and comparatively few alterations were made in the text from"
340,INTRODUCTION,that date to the last collected edition in 1898.
341,INTRODUCTION,
342,INTRODUCTION,"All the editions up to, and including, that of 1898 have been carefully"
343,INTRODUCTION,"collated, so that the student of Tennyson can follow step by step the"
344,INTRODUCTION,process by which he arrived at that perfection of expression which is
345,INTRODUCTION,perhaps his most striking characteristic as a poet. And it was indeed a
346,INTRODUCTION,"trophy of labour, of the application ""of patient touches of unwearied"
347,INTRODUCTION,"art"". Whoever will turn, say to 'The Palace of Art,' to 'none,' to the"
348,INTRODUCTION,"'Dream of Fair Women,' or even to 'The Sea-Fairies' and to 'The Lady of"
349,INTRODUCTION,"Shalott,' will see what labour was expended on their composition."
350,INTRODUCTION,"Nothing indeed can be more interesting than to note the touches, the"
351,INTRODUCTION,substitution of which measured the whole distance between mediocrity and
352,INTRODUCTION,"excellence. Take, for example, the magical alteration in the couplet in"
353,INTRODUCTION,the 'Dream of Fair Women':--
354,INTRODUCTION,
355,INTRODUCTION,
356,INTRODUCTION,One drew a sharp knife thro' my tender throat
357,INTRODUCTION,"Slowly,--and nothing more,"
358,INTRODUCTION,
359,INTRODUCTION,
360,INTRODUCTION,into
361,INTRODUCTION,
362,INTRODUCTION,
363,INTRODUCTION,The bright death quiver'd at the victim's throat;
364,INTRODUCTION,Touch'd; and I knew no more.
365,INTRODUCTION,
366,INTRODUCTION,
367,INTRODUCTION,"Or, in the same poem:--"
368,INTRODUCTION,
369,INTRODUCTION,
370,INTRODUCTION,What nights we had in Egypt!
371,INTRODUCTION,I could hit His humours while I cross'd him.
372,INTRODUCTION,"O the life I led him, and the dalliance and the wit,"
373,INTRODUCTION,
374,INTRODUCTION,
375,INTRODUCTION,into
376,INTRODUCTION,
377,INTRODUCTION,"We drank the Libyan Sun to sleep, and lit"
378,INTRODUCTION,Lamps which outburn'd Canopus.
379,INTRODUCTION,O my life In Egypt!
380,INTRODUCTION,"O the dalliance and the wit,"
381,INTRODUCTION,The flattery and the strife.
382,INTRODUCTION,
383,INTRODUCTION,
384,INTRODUCTION,"Or, in 'Mariana in the South':--"
385,INTRODUCTION,
386,INTRODUCTION,"She mov'd her lips, she pray'd alone,"
387,INTRODUCTION,"She praying, disarray'd and warm"
388,INTRODUCTION,"From slumber, deep her wavy form"
389,INTRODUCTION,"In the dark lustrous mirror shone,"
390,INTRODUCTION,
391,INTRODUCTION,into
392,INTRODUCTION,
393,INTRODUCTION,"Complaining, ""Mother, give me grace"
394,INTRODUCTION,"To help me of my weary load""."
395,INTRODUCTION,And on the liquid mirror glow'd
396,INTRODUCTION,The clear perfection of her face.
397,INTRODUCTION,
398,INTRODUCTION,
399,INTRODUCTION,How happy is this slight alteration in the verses 'To J. S.' which
400,INTRODUCTION,corrects one of the falsest notes ever struck by a poet:--
401,INTRODUCTION,
402,INTRODUCTION,A tear Dropt on _my tablets_ as I wrote.
403,INTRODUCTION,
404,INTRODUCTION,A tear Dropt on _the letters_ as I wrote.
405,INTRODUCTION,
406,INTRODUCTION,or where in 'Locksley Hall' a splendidly graphic touch of description is
407,INTRODUCTION,"gained by the alteration of ""_droops_ the trailer from the crag"" into"
408,INTRODUCTION,"""_swings_ the trailer""."
409,INTRODUCTION,
410,INTRODUCTION,So again in 'Love and Duty':--
411,INTRODUCTION,
412,INTRODUCTION,Should my shadow cross thy thoughts
413,INTRODUCTION,"Too sadly for their peace, _so put it back_."
414,INTRODUCTION,"For calmer hours in memory's darkest hold,"
415,INTRODUCTION,
416,INTRODUCTION,"where by altering ""so put it back"" into ""remand it thou,"" a somewhat"
417,INTRODUCTION,ludicrous image is at all events softened.
418,INTRODUCTION,
419,INTRODUCTION,What great care Tennyson took with his phraseology is curiously
420,INTRODUCTION,"illustrated in 'The May Queen'. In the 1842 edition ""Robin"" was the name"
421,INTRODUCTION,"of the May Queen's lover. In 1843 it was altered to ""Robert,"" and in"
422,INTRODUCTION,"1845 and subsequent editions back to ""Robin""."
423,INTRODUCTION,
424,INTRODUCTION,"Compare, again, the old stanza in 'The Miller's Daughter':--"
425,INTRODUCTION,
426,INTRODUCTION,"How dear to me in youth, my love,"
427,INTRODUCTION,Was everything about the mill;
428,INTRODUCTION,"The black and silent pool above,"
429,INTRODUCTION,"The pool beneath it never still,"
430,INTRODUCTION,
431,INTRODUCTION,
432,INTRODUCTION,with what was afterwards substituted:--
433,INTRODUCTION,
434,INTRODUCTION,
435,INTRODUCTION,I loved the brimming wave that swam
436,INTRODUCTION,"Through quiet meadows round the mill,"
437,INTRODUCTION,"The sleepy pool above the dam,"
438,INTRODUCTION,The pool beneath it never still.
439,INTRODUCTION,
440,INTRODUCTION,
441,INTRODUCTION,"Another most felicitous emendation is to be found in 'The Poet',"
442,INTRODUCTION,where the edition of 1830 reads:--
443,INTRODUCTION,
444,INTRODUCTION,
445,INTRODUCTION,And in the bordure of her robe was writ
446,INTRODUCTION,"Wisdom, a name to shake"
447,INTRODUCTION,"Hoar anarchies, as with a thunderfit."
448,INTRODUCTION,
449,INTRODUCTION,
450,INTRODUCTION,This in 1842 appears as:--
451,INTRODUCTION,
452,INTRODUCTION,
453,INTRODUCTION,And in her raiment's hem was trac'd in flame
454,INTRODUCTION,"Wisdom, a name to shake"
455,INTRODUCTION,All evil dreams of power--a sacred name.
456,INTRODUCTION,
457,INTRODUCTION,
458,INTRODUCTION,"Again, in the 'Lotos Eaters'"
459,INTRODUCTION,
460,INTRODUCTION,
461,INTRODUCTION,_Three thunder-cloven thrones of oldest snow_
462,INTRODUCTION,Stood sunset-flushed
463,INTRODUCTION,
464,INTRODUCTION,
465,INTRODUCTION,is changed into
466,INTRODUCTION,
467,INTRODUCTION,_Three silent pinnacles of aged snow_.
468,INTRODUCTION,
469,INTRODUCTION,
470,INTRODUCTION,So in 'Will Waterproof' the cumbrous
471,INTRODUCTION,
472,INTRODUCTION,
473,INTRODUCTION,"Like Hezekiah's backward runs The shadow of my days,"
474,INTRODUCTION,
475,INTRODUCTION,
476,INTRODUCTION,was afterwards simplified into
477,INTRODUCTION,
478,INTRODUCTION,
479,INTRODUCTION,Against its fountain upward runs
480,INTRODUCTION,The current of my days.
481,INTRODUCTION,
482,INTRODUCTION,
483,INTRODUCTION,Not less felicitous have been the additions made from time to time. Thus
484,INTRODUCTION,in 'Audley Court' the concluding lines ran:--
485,INTRODUCTION,
486,INTRODUCTION,
487,INTRODUCTION,"The harbour buoy,"
488,INTRODUCTION,With one green sparkle ever and anon
489,INTRODUCTION,Dipt by itself.
490,INTRODUCTION,
491,INTRODUCTION,
492,INTRODUCTION,But what vividness is there in the subsequent insertion of
493,INTRODUCTION,
494,INTRODUCTION,
495,INTRODUCTION,"""Sole star of phosphorescence in the calm."""
496,INTRODUCTION,
497,INTRODUCTION,
498,INTRODUCTION,between the first line and the second.

516,INTRODUCTION,"Counting the dewy pebbles, fix'd in thought."
517,INTRODUCTION,
518,INTRODUCTION,
519,INTRODUCTION,There is an alteration in none which is very interesting. Till 1884
520,INTRODUCTION,this was allowed to stand:--
521,INTRODUCTION,
522,INTRODUCTION,
523,INTRODUCTION,"The lizard, with his shadow on the stone,"
524,INTRODUCTION,"Rests like a shadow, _and the cicala sleeps_."
525,INTRODUCTION,
526,INTRODUCTION,
527,INTRODUCTION,No one could have known better than Tennyson that the cicala is loudest
528,INTRODUCTION,"in the torrid calm of the noonday, as Theocritus, Virgil, Byron and"
529,INTRODUCTION,"innumerable other poets have noticed; at last he altered it, but at the"
530,INTRODUCTION,"heavy price of a cumbrous pleonasm, into ""and the winds are dead""."
531,INTRODUCTION,
532,INTRODUCTION,He allowed many years to elapse before he corrected another error in
533,INTRODUCTION,natural history--but at last the alteration came. In 'The Poet's Song'
534,INTRODUCTION,in the line--
535,INTRODUCTION,
536,INTRODUCTION,
537,INTRODUCTION,"The swallow stopt as he hunted the _bee_,"
538,INTRODUCTION,
539,INTRODUCTION,
540,INTRODUCTION,"the ""fly"" which the swallow does hunt was substituted for what it does"
541,INTRODUCTION,"not hunt, and that for very obvious reasons. But whoever would see what"
542,INTRODUCTION,Tennyson's poetry has owed to elaborate revision and scrupulous care
543,INTRODUCTION,"would do well to compare the first edition of 'Mariana in the South',"
544,INTRODUCTION,"'The Sea-Fairies', 'OEnone', 'The Lady of Shalott', 'The Palace of Art'"
545,INTRODUCTION,and 'A Dream of Fair Women' with the poems as they are presented in
546,INTRODUCTION,"1853. Poets do not always improve their verses by revision, as all"
547,INTRODUCTION,students of Wordsworth's text could abundantly illustrate; but it may be
548,INTRODUCTION,"doubted whether, in these poems at least, Tennyson ever made a single"
549,INTRODUCTION,"alteration which was not for the better. Fitzgerald, indeed, contended"
550,INTRODUCTION,"that in some cases, particularly in 'The Miller's Daughter', Tennyson"
551,INTRODUCTION,"would have done well to let the first reading stand, but few critics"
552,INTRODUCTION,would agree with him in the instances he gives. We may perhaps regret
553,INTRODUCTION,the sacrifice of such a stanza as this--
554,INTRODUCTION,
555,INTRODUCTION,"Each coltsfoot down the grassy bent, Whose round leaves hold the"
556,INTRODUCTION,"gathered shower, Each quaintly folded cuckoo pint, And silver-paly"
557,INTRODUCTION,cuckoo flower.

559,INTRODUCTION,
560,INTRODUCTION,
561,INTRODUCTION,
562,II,II
563,II,
564,II,Tennyson's genius was slow in maturing. The poems contributed by him to
565,II,"the volume of 1827, 'Poems by Two Brothers', are not without some slight"
566,II,"promise, but are very far from indicating extraordinary powers. A great"
567,II,"advance is discernible in 'Timbuctoo', but that Matthew Arnold should"
568,II,have discovered in it the germ of Tennyson's future powers is probably
569,II,to be attributed to the youth of the critic. Tennyson was in his
570,II,"twenty-second year when the 'Poems Chiefly Lyrical' appeared, and what"
571,II,strikes us in these poems is certainly not what Arthur Hallam saw in
572,II,them: much rather what Coleridge and Wilson discerned in them. They are
573,II,the poems of a fragile and somewhat morbid young man in whose temper we
574,II,"seem to see a touch of Hamlet, a touch of Romeo and, more healthily, a"
575,II,touch of Mercutio. Their most promising characteristic is the
576,II,versatility displayed. Thus we find 'Mariana' side by side with the
577,II,"'Supposed Confessions', the 'Ode to Memory' with Greek['oi rheontes'],"
578,II,"'The Ballad of Oriana' with 'The Dying Swan', 'Recollections of The"
579,II,Arabian Nights' with 'The Poet'. Their worst fault is affectation.
580,II,Perhaps the utmost that can be said for them is that they display a fine
581,II,"but somewhat thin vein of original genius, after deducing what they owe"
582,II,"to Coleridge, to Keats and to other poets. This is seen in the magical"
583,II,"touches of description, in the exquisite felicity of expression and"
584,II,"rhythm which frequently mark them, in the pathos and power of such a"
585,II,"poem as 'Oriana', in the pathos and charm of such poems as 'Mariana' and"
586,II,"'A Dirge', in the rich and almost gorgeous fancy displayed in 'The"
587,II,Recollections'.
588,II,
589,II,The poems of 1833 are much more ambitious and strike deeper notes. Here
590,II,"comes in for the first time that Greek[spondai_otaes'], that high"
591,II,seriousness which is one of Tennyson's chief characteristics--we see it
592,II,"in 'The Palace of Art', in 'none' and in the verses 'To J. S.' But in"
593,II,"intrinsic merit the poems were no advance on their predecessors, for the"
594,II,"execution was not equal to the design. The best, such as 'none', 'A"
595,II,"Dream of Fair Women', 'The Palace of Art', 'The Lady of Shalott'--I am"
596,II,speaking of course of these poems in their first form--were full of
597,II,extraordinary blemishes. The volume was degraded by pieces which were
598,II,"very unworthy of him, such as 'O Darling Room' and the verses 'To"
599,II,"Christopher North', and affectations of the worst kind deformed many,"
600,II,"nay, perhaps the majority of the poems. But the capital defect lay in"
601,II,"the workmanship. The diction is often languid and slipshod, sometimes"
602,II,"quaintly affected, and we can never go far without encountering lines,"
603,II,"stanzas, whole poems which cry aloud for the file. The power and charm"
604,II,"of Tennyson's poetry, even at its ripest, depend very largely, often"
605,II,"mainly, on expression, and the couplet which he envied Browning,"
606,II,
607,II,"The little more, and how much it is,"
608,II,"The little less, and what worlds away,"
609,II,
610,II,"is strangely applicable to his own art. On a single word, on a subtle"
611,II,"collocation, on a slight touch depend often his finest effects: ""the"
612,II,"little less"" reduces him to mediocrity, ""the little more"" and he is with"
613,II,"the masters. To no poetry would the application of Goethe's test be, as"
614,II,"a rule, more fatal--that the real poetic quality in poetry is that which"
615,II,remains when it has been translated literally into prose.
616,II,
617,II,Whoever will compare the poems of 1832 with the same poems as they
618,II,appeared in 1842 will see that the difference is not so much a
619,II,"difference in degree, but almost a difference in kind. In the collection"
620,II,"of 1832 there were three gems, 'The Sisters', the lines 'To J. S.' and"
621,II,"'The May Queen'. Almost all the others which are of any value were, in"
622,II,"the edition of 1842, carefully revised, and in some cases practically"
623,II,rewritten. If Tennyson's career had closed in 1833 he would hardly have
624,II,won a prominent place among the minor poets of the present century. The
625,II,nine years which intervened between the publication of his second volume
626,II,"and the volumes of 1842 were the making of him, and transformed a mere"
627,II,dilettante into a master. Much has been said about the brutality of
628,II,"Lockhart's review in the 'Quarterly'. In some respects it was stupid, in"
629,II,"some respects it was unjust, but of one thing there can be no doubt--it"
630,II,had a most salutary effect. It held up the mirror to weaknesses and
631,II,"deficiencies which, if Tennyson did not care to acknowledge to others,"
632,II,he must certainly have acknowledged to himself. It roused him and put
633,II,him on his mettle. It was a wholesome antidote to the enervating
634,II,"flattery of coteries and ""apostles"" who were certainly talking a great"
635,II,"deal of nonsense about him, as Arthur Hallam's essay in the 'Englishman'"
636,II,"shows. During the next nine years he published nothing, with the"
637,II,exception of two unimportant contributions to certain minor
638,II,"periodicals.[1] But he was educating himself, saturating himself with"
639,II,"all that is best in the poetry of Ancient Greece and Rome, of modern"
640,II,"Italy, of Germany and of his own country, studying theology,"
641,II,"metaphysics, natural history, geology, astronomy and travels, observing"
642,II,"nature with the eye of a poet, a painter and a naturalist. Nor was he a"
643,II,"recluse. He threw himself heartily into the life of his time, following"
644,II,"with the keenest interest all the great political and social movements,"
645,II,"the progress and effects of the Reform Bill, the troubles in Ireland,"
646,II,"the troubles with the Colonies, the struggles between the Protectionists"
647,II,"and the Free Traders, Municipal Reform, the advance of the democracy,"
648,II,"Chartism, the popular education question. He travelled on the Continent,"
649,II,"he travelled in Wales and Scotland, he visited most parts of England,"
650,II,"not as an idle tourist, but as a student with note-book in hand. And he"
651,II,had been submitted also to the discipline which is of all disciplines
652,II,"the most necessary to the poet, and without which, as Goethe says, ""he"
653,II,"knows not the heavenly powers"": he had ""ate his bread in sorrow"". The"
654,II,"death of his father in 1831 had already brought him face to face, as he"
655,II,"has himself expressed it, with the most solemn of all mysteries. In 1833"
656,II,"he had an awful shock in the sudden death of his friend Arthur Hallam,"
657,II,"""an overwhelming sorrow which blotted out all joy from his life and made"
658,II,"him long for death"". He had other minor troubles which contributed"
659,II,"greatly to depress him,--the breaking up of the old home at Somersby,"
660,II,"his own poverty and uncertain prospects, his being compelled in"
661,II,consequence to break off all intercourse with Miss Emily Selwood. It is
662,II,possible that 'Love and Duty' may have reference to this sorrow; it is
663,II,certain that 'The Two Voices' is autobiographical.
664,II,
665,II,"Such was his education between 1832 and 1842, and such the influences"
666,II,"which were moulding him, while he was slowly evolving 'In Memoriam' and"
667,II,the poems first published in the latter year. To the revision of the old
668,II,poems he brought tastes and instincts cultivated by the critical study
669,II,"of all that was best in the poetry of the world, and more particularly"
670,II,by a familiarity singularly intimate and affectionate with the
671,II,masterpieces of the ancient classics; he brought also the skill of a
672,II,"practised workman, for his diligence in production was literally that of"
673,II,Sir Joshua Reynolds in the sister art--'nulla dies sine lineâ'. Into the
674,II,composition of the new poems all this entered. He was no longer a
675,II,"trifler and a Hedonist. As Spedding has said, his former poems betrayed"
676,II,"""an over-indulgence in the luxuries of the senses, a profusion of"
677,II,"splendours, harmonies, perfumes, gorgeous apparel, luscious meals and"
678,II,"drinks, and creature comforts which rather pall upon the sense, and make"
679,II,"the glories of the outward world to obscure a little the world within""."
680,II,"Like his own 'Lady of Shalott', he had communed too much with shadows."
681,II,"But the serious poet now speaks. He appeals less to the ear and the eye,"
682,II,and more to the heart. The sensuous is subordinated to the spiritual and
683,II,the moral. He deals immediately with the dearest concerns of man and of
684,II,"society. He has ceased to trifle. The the [Greek: spondai_otaes,] the"
685,II,"high seriousness of the true poet, occasional before, now pervades and"
686,II,enters essentially into his work. It is interesting to note how many of
687,II,these poems have direct didactic purpose. How solemn is the message
688,II,"delivered in such poems as 'The Palace of Art' and 'The Vision of Sin',"
689,II,"how noble the teaching in 'Love and Duty', in 'Oenone', in 'Godiva', in"
690,II,'Ulysses'; to how many must such a poem as 'The Two Voices' have brought
691,II,solace and light; how full of salutary lessons are the political poems
692,II,"'You ask me, why, though ill at ease' and 'Love thou thy Land', and how"
693,II,"noble is their expression! And, even where the poems are less directly"
694,II,"didactic, it is such refreshment as busy life needs to converse with"
695,II,"them, so pure, so wholesome, so graciously human is their tone, so"
696,II,tranquilly beautiful is their world. Who could lay down 'The Miller's
697,II,"Daughter, Dora, The Golden Year, The Gardener's Daughter, The Talking"
698,II,"Oak, Audley Court, The Day Dream' without something of the feeling which"
699,II,Goethe felt when he first laid down 'The Vicar of Wakefield?' In the
700,II,"best lyrics in these volumes, such as 'Break, Break', and 'Move"
701,II,"Eastward', 'Happy Earth', the most fastidious of critics must recognise"
702,II,flawless gems. In the two volumes of 1842 Tennyson carried to perfection
703,II,"all that was best in his earlier poems, and displayed powers of which he"
704,II,"may have given some indication in his cruder efforts, but which must"
705,II,certainly have exceeded the expectation of the most sanguine of his
706,II,rational admirers. These volumes justly gave him the first place among
707,II,"the poets of his time, and that supremacy he maintained--in the opinion"
708,II,of most--till the day of his death. It would be absurd to contend that
709,II,Tennyson's subsequent publications added nothing to the fame which will
710,II,"be secured to him by these poems. But this at least is certain, that,"
711,II,"taken with 'In Memorium', they represent the crown and flower of his"
712,II,achievement. What is best in them he never excelled and perhaps never
713,II,"equalled. We should be the poorer, and much the poorer, for the loss of"
714,II,"anything which he produced subsequently, it is true; but would we"
715,II,exchange half a dozen of the best of these poems or a score of the best
716,II,sections of 'In Memoriam' for all that he produced between 1850 and his
717,II,death?
718,II,
719,II,"[Footnote 1: In 'The Keepsake', ""St. Agnes' Eve""; in 'The Tribute',"
720,II,"""Stanzas"": ""Oh! that 'twere possible"". Between 1831 and 1832 he had"
721,II,"contributed to 'The Gem' three, ""No more,"" ""Anacreontics,"" and ""A"
722,II,"Fragment""; in 'The Englishman's Magazine', a Sonnet; in 'The Yorkshire"
723,II,"Literary Annual', lines, ""There are three things that fill my heart with"

837,7. POLITICAL GROUP,In surveying these poems two things must strike every one--their very
838,7. POLITICAL GROUP,wide range and their very fragmentary character. There is scarcely any
839,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"side of life on which they do not touch, scarcely any phase of passion"
840,7. POLITICAL GROUP,and emotion to which they do not give exquisite expression. Take the
841,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"love poems: compare 'Fatima' with 'Isabel', 'The Miller's Daughter' with"
842,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"'Locksley Hall', 'The Gardener's Daughter' with 'Madeline', or 'Mariana'"
843,7. POLITICAL GROUP,with Cleopatra in the 'Dream of Fair Women'. When did love find purer
844,7. POLITICAL GROUP,and nobler expression than in 'Love and Duty?' When has sorrow found
845,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"utterance more perfect than in the verses 'To J. S '., or the passion for"
846,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"the past than in 'Break, Break, Break', or revenge and jealousy than in"
847,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"'The Sisters?' In 'The Two Voices', 'The Palace of Art' and 'The Vision"
848,7. POLITICAL GROUP,of Sin' we are in another sphere. They are appeals to the soul of man on
849,7. POLITICAL GROUP,subjects of momentous concern to him. And each is a masterpiece. What is
850,7. POLITICAL GROUP,proper to philosophy and what is proper to poetry have never perhaps
851,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"been so happily blended. They have all the sensuous charm of Keats, but"
852,7. POLITICAL GROUP,the prose of Hume could not have presented the truths which they are
853,7. POLITICAL GROUP,designed to convey with more lucidity and precision. In that superb
854,7. POLITICAL GROUP,fragment the 'Morte d'Arthur' we have many of the noblest attributes of
855,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Epic poetry. 'none' is the perfection of the classical idyll, 'The"
856,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Gardener's Daughter' and the idylls that follow it of the romantic. 'Sir
857,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Galahad' and 'St. Agnes' are in the vein of Keats and Coleridge, but"
858,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Keats and Coleridge have produced nothing more exquisite and nothing so
859,7. POLITICAL GROUP,ethereal. 'The Lotos* Eaters' is perhaps the most purely delicious poem
860,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"ever written, the 'ne plus ultra' of sensuous loveliness, and yet the"
861,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"poet who gave us that has given us also the political poems, poems as"
862,7. POLITICAL GROUP,trenchant and austerely dignified in style as they are pregnant with
863,7. POLITICAL GROUP,practical wisdom. There is the same versatility displayed in the
864,7. POLITICAL GROUP,trifles.
865,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
866,7. POLITICAL GROUP,But all is fragmentary. No thread strings these jewels. They form a
867,7. POLITICAL GROUP,collection of gems unset and unarranged. Without any system or any
868,7. POLITICAL GROUP,definite scope they have nothing of that unity in diversity which is so
869,7. POLITICAL GROUP,perceptible in the lyrics and minor poems of Goethe and Wordsworth.
870,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Capricious as the gyrations of a sea-gull seem the poet's moods and
871,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"movements. We have now the reveries of a love-sick maiden, now the"
872,7. POLITICAL GROUP,picture of a soul wrestling with despair and death; here a study from
873,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"rural life, or a study in character, there a sermon on politics, or a"
874,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"descent into the depths of psychological truth, or a sketch from nature."
875,7. POLITICAL GROUP,But nothing could be more concentrated than the power employed to shape
876,7. POLITICAL GROUP,each fragment into form. What Pope says of the 'Aeneid' may be applied
877,7. POLITICAL GROUP,with very literal truth to these poems:--
878,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
879,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
880,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Finish'd the whole, and laboured every part"
881,7. POLITICAL GROUP,With patient touches of unwearied art.
882,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
883,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
884,7. POLITICAL GROUP,In the poems of 1842 we have the secret of Tennyson's eminence as a poet
885,7. POLITICAL GROUP,as well as the secret of his limitations. He appears to have been
886,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"constitutionally deficient in what the Greeks called 'architektoniké',"
887,7. POLITICAL GROUP,combination and disposition on a large scale. The measure of his power
888,7. POLITICAL GROUP,as a constructive artist is given us in the poem in which the English
889,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"idylls may be said to culminate, namely, 'Enoch Arden'. 'In Memoriam'"
890,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"and the 'Idylls of the King' have a sort of spiritual unity, but they"
891,7. POLITICAL GROUP,are a series of fragments tacked rather than fused together. It is the
892,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"same with 'Maud', and it is the same with 'The Princess'. His poems have"
893,7. POLITICAL GROUP,always a tendency to resolve themselves into a series of cameos: it is
894,7. POLITICAL GROUP,only the short poems which have organic unity. A gift of felicitous and
895,7. POLITICAL GROUP,musical expression which is absolutely marvellous; an instinctive
896,7. POLITICAL GROUP,sympathy with what is best and most elevated in the sphere of ordinary
897,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"life, of ordinary thought and sentiment, of ordinary activity with"
898,7. POLITICAL GROUP,consummate representative power; a most rare faculty of seizing and
899,7. POLITICAL GROUP,fixing in very perfect form what is commonly so inexpressible because so
900,7. POLITICAL GROUP,impalpable and evanescent in emotion and expression; a power of catching
901,7. POLITICAL GROUP,and rendering the charm of nature with a fidelity and vividness which
902,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"resemble magic; and lastly, unrivalled skill in choosing, repolishing"
903,7. POLITICAL GROUP,and remounting the gems which are our common inheritance from the past:
904,7. POLITICAL GROUP,these are the gifts which will secure permanence for his work as long as
905,7. POLITICAL GROUP,the English language lasts.
906,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
907,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"In his power of crystallising commonplaces he stands next to Pope, in"
908,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"subtle felicity of expression beside Virgil. And, when he says of Virgil"
909,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"that we find in his diction ""all the grace of all the muses often"
910,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"flowering in one lonely word,"" he says what is literally true of his own"
911,7. POLITICAL GROUP,work. As a master of style his place is in the first rank among English
912,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"classical poets. But his style is the perfection of art. His diction,"
913,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"like the diction of Milton and Gray, resembles mosaic work. With a touch"
914,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"here and a touch there, now from memory, now from unconscious"
915,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"assimilation, inlaying here an epithet and there a phrase, adding,"
916,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"subtracting, heightening, modifying, substituting one metaphor for"
917,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"another, developing what is latent in the suggestive imagery of a"
918,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"predecessor, laying under contribution the most intimate familiarity"
919,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"with what is best in the literature of the ancient and modern world, the"
920,7. POLITICAL GROUP,unwearied artist toils patiently on till his precious mosaic work is
921,7. POLITICAL GROUP,without a flaw. All the resources of rhetoric are employed to give
922,7. POLITICAL GROUP,distinction to his style and every figure in rhetoric finds expression
923,7. POLITICAL GROUP,in his diction: Hypallage as in
924,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
925,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
926,7. POLITICAL GROUP,_The pillard dusk_ Of sounding sycamores.
927,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
928,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--_Audley Court_.
929,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
930,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
931,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Paronomasia as in
932,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
933,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
934,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"The seawind sang _Shrill, chill_ with flakes of foam."
935,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
936,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--_Morte d'Arthur_.
937,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
938,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
939,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Oxymoron as
940,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
941,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"_Behold_ them _unbeheld, unheard Hear_ all."
942,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
943,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'none'.
944,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
945,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
946,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Hyperbaton as in
947,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
948,7. POLITICAL GROUP,The _dew-impearled_ winds of dawn.
949,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
950,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'Ode to Memory'.
951,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
952,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
953,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Metonymy as in
954,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
955,7. POLITICAL GROUP,The _bright death_ quiver'd at the victim's throat.
956,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
957,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'Dream of Fair Women'.
958,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
959,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
960,7. POLITICAL GROUP,or in
961,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
962,7. POLITICAL GROUP,For some three _careless moans_ The summer pilot of an empty heart.
963,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
964,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'Gardener's Daughter'.
965,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
966,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
967,7. POLITICAL GROUP,No poet since Milton has employed what is known as Onomatopoeia with so
968,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"much effect. Not to go farther than the poems of 1842, we have in the"
969,7. POLITICAL GROUP,'Morte d'Arthur':--
970,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
971,7. POLITICAL GROUP,So all day long the noise of battle _rolled
972,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Among the mountains by the winter sea_;
973,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
974,7. POLITICAL GROUP,or
975,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
976,7. POLITICAL GROUP,_Dry clashed_ his harness in the icy caves
977,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"And _barren chasms_, and all to left and right"
978,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"The _bare black cliff clang'd round_ him, as he bas'd"
979,7. POLITICAL GROUP,His feet _on juts of slippery crag that rang
980,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels_--
981,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
982,7. POLITICAL GROUP,or the exquisite
983,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
984,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"I heard the _water lapping on the crag_,"
985,7. POLITICAL GROUP,And the _long ripple washing in the reeds_.
986,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
987,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"So in 'The Dying Swan',"
988,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
989,7. POLITICAL GROUP,And _the wavy swell of the soughing reeds_.
990,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
991,7. POLITICAL GROUP,See too the whole of 'Oriana' and the description of the dance at
992,7. POLITICAL GROUP,the beginning of 'The Vision of Sin.'
993,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
994,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Assonance, alliteration, the revival or adoption of obsolete and"
995,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"provincial words, the transplantation of phrases and idioms from the"
996,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Greek and Latin languages, the employment of common words in uncommon"
997,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"senses, all are pressed into the service of adding distinction to his"
998,7. POLITICAL GROUP,diction. His diction blends the two extremes of simplicity and
999,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"artificiality, but with such fine tact that this strange combination has"
1000,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"seldom the effect of incongruity. Longinus has remarked that ""as the"
1001,7. POLITICAL GROUP,fainter lustre of the stars is put out of sight by the all-encompassing
1002,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"rays of the sun, so when sublimity sheds its light round the sophistries"
1003,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"of rhetoric they become invisible"".[1] What Longinus says of ""sublimity"""
1004,7. POLITICAL GROUP,is equally true of sincerity and truthfulness in combination with
1005,7. POLITICAL GROUP,exquisitely harmonious expression. We have an illustration in Gray's
1006,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"'Elegy'. Nothing could be more artificial than the style, but what poem"
1007,7. POLITICAL GROUP,in the world appeals more directly to the heart and to the eye? It is
1008,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"one thing to call art to the assistance of art, it is quite another"
1009,7. POLITICAL GROUP,thing to call art to the assistance of nature. And this is what both
1010,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Gray and Tennyson do, and this is why their artificiality, so far from"
1011,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"shocking us, ""passes in music out of sight"". But this cannot be said of"
1012,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Tennyson without reserve. At times his strained endeavours to give
1013,7. POLITICAL GROUP,distinction to his style by putting common things in an uncommon way led
1014,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"him into intolerable affectation. Thus we have ""the knightly growth that"
1015,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"fringed his lips"" for a moustache, ""azure pillars of the hearth"" for"
1016,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"ascending smoke, ""ambrosial orbs"" for apples, ""frayed magnificence"" for"
1017,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"a shabby dress, ""the secular abyss to come"" for future ages, ""the"
1018,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"sinless years that breathed beneath the Syrian blue"" for the life of"
1019,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Christ, ""up went the hush'd amaze of hand and eye"" for a gesture of"
1020,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"surprise, and the like. One of the worst instances is in 'In Memoriam',"
1021,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"where what is appropriate to the simple sentiment finds, as it should"
1022,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"do, corresponding simplicity of expression in the first couplet, to"
1023,7. POLITICAL GROUP,collapse into the falsetto of strained artificiality in the second:--
1024,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1025,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1026,7. POLITICAL GROUP,To rest beneath the clover sod
1027,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"That takes the sunshine and the rains,"
1028,7. POLITICAL GROUP,_Or where the kneeling hamlet drains
1029,7. POLITICAL GROUP,The chalice of the grapes of God_.
1030,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1031,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1032,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"An illustration of the same thing, almost as offensive, is in 'Enoch"
1033,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Arden', where, in an otherwise studiously simple diction, Enoch's wares"
1034,7. POLITICAL GROUP,as a fisherman become
1035,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1036,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Enoch's _ocean spoil_
1037,7. POLITICAL GROUP,In ocean-smelling osier.
1038,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1039,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1040,7. POLITICAL GROUP,But these peculiarities are less common in the earlier poems than in the
1041,7. POLITICAL GROUP,later: it was a vicious habit which grew on him.
1042,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1043,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"But, if exception may sometimes be taken to his diction, no exception"
1044,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"can be taken to his rhythm. No English poet since Milton, Tennyson's"
1045,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"only superior in this respect, had a finer ear or a more consummate"
1046,7. POLITICAL GROUP,mastery over all the resources of rhythmical expression. What colours
1047,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"are to a painter rhythm is, in description, to the poet, and few have"
1048,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"rivalled, none have excelled Tennyson in this. Take the following:--"
1049,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1050,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1051,7. POLITICAL GROUP,And ghastly thro' the drizzling rain
1052,7. POLITICAL GROUP,_On the bald street strikes the blank day_.
1053,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1054,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'In Memoriam'.
1055,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1056,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"See particularly 'In Memoriam', cvii., the lines beginning ""Fiercely"
1057,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"flies,"" to ""darken on the rolling brine"": the description of the island"
1058,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"in 'Enoch Arden'; but specification is needless, it applies to all his"
1059,7. POLITICAL GROUP,descriptive poetry. It is marvellous that he can produce such effects by
1060,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"such simple means: a mere enumeration of particulars will often do it,"
1061,7. POLITICAL GROUP,as here:--
1062,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1063,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1064,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"No gray old grange or lonely fold,"
1065,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Or low morass and whispering reed,"
1066,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Or simple style from mead to mead,"
1067,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Or sheep walk up the windy wold.
1068,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1069,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"--'In Memoriam', c."
1070,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1071,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Or here:--
1072,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1073,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1074,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"The meal sacks on the whitened floor,"
1075,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"The dark round of the dripping wheel,"
1076,7. POLITICAL GROUP,The very air about the door Made misty with the floating meal.
1077,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1078,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'The Miller's Daughter'.
1079,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1080,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1081,7. POLITICAL GROUP,His blank verse is best described by negatives. It has not the endless
1082,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"variety, the elasticity and freedom of Shakespeare's, it has not the"
1083,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"massiveness and majesty of Milton's, it has not the austere grandeur of"
1084,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Wordsworth's at its best, it has not the wavy swell, ""the linked"
1085,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"sweetness long drawn out"" of Shelley's, but its distinguishing feature"
1086,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"is, if we may use the expression, its importunate beauty. What Coleridge"
1087,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"said of Claudian's style may be applied to it: ""Every line, nay every"
1088,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"word stops, looks full in your face and asks and begs for praise"". His"
1089,7. POLITICAL GROUP,earlier blank verse is less elaborate and seemingly more spontaneous and
1090,7. POLITICAL GROUP,easy than his later. [2] But it is in his lyric verse that his rhythm is
1091,7. POLITICAL GROUP,seen in its greatest perfection. No English lyrics have more magic or
1092,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"more haunting beauty, more of that which charms at once and charms for"
1093,7. POLITICAL GROUP,ever.
1094,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1095,7. POLITICAL GROUP,In his description of nature he is incomparable. Take the following from
1096,7. POLITICAL GROUP,'The Dying Swan':--
1097,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1098,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1099,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Some blue peaks in the distance rose,"
1100,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"And white against the cold-white sky,"
1101,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Shone out their crowning snows.
1102,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"One willow over the river wept,"
1103,7. POLITICAL GROUP,And shook the wave as the wind did sigh;
1104,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Above in the wind was the swallow,"
1105,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Chasing itself at its own wild will,"
1106,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1107,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1108,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"or the opening scene in 'none' and in 'The Lotos Eaters', or the"
1109,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"meadow scene in 'The Gardener's Daughter', or the conclusion of 'Audley"
1110,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Court', or the forest scene in the 'Dream of Fair Women', or this stanza"
1111,7. POLITICAL GROUP,in 'Mariana in the South':--
1112,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1113,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1114,7. POLITICAL GROUP,There all in spaces rosy-bright
1115,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Large Hesper glitter'd on her tears,"
1116,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"And deepening through the silent spheres,"
1117,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Heaven over Heaven rose the night.
1118,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1119,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1120,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"A single line, nay, a single word, and a scene is by magic before us, as"
1121,7. POLITICAL GROUP,here where the sea is looked down upon from an immense height:--
1122,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1123,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1124,7. POLITICAL GROUP,The _wrinkled_ sea beneath him _crawls_.
1125,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1126,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'The Eagle'.
1127,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1128,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1129,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Or here of a ship at sea, in the distance:--"
1130,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1131,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1132,7. POLITICAL GROUP,And on through zones of light and shadow
1133,7. POLITICAL GROUP,_Glimmer away to the lonely deep_.
1134,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1135,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'To the Rev. F. D. Maurice'.
1136,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1137,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1138,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Or here of waters falling high up on mountains:--
1139,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1140,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1141,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Their thousand _wreaths of dangling water-smoke_.
1142,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1143,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'The Princess'.
1144,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1145,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1146,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Or of a water-fall seen at a distance:--
1147,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1148,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1149,7. POLITICAL GROUP,And _like a downward smoke_ the slender stream
1150,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Along the cliff _to fall and pause and fall_ did seem.
1151,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1152,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1153,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Or here again:--
1154,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1155,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1156,7. POLITICAL GROUP,We left the dying ebb that _faintly lipp'd
1157,7. POLITICAL GROUP,The flat red granite_.
1158,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1159,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1160,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Or here of a wave:--
1161,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1162,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1163,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Like a wave in the wild North Sea
1164,7. POLITICAL GROUP,_Green glimmering toward the summit_ bears with all
1165,7. POLITICAL GROUP,_Its stormy crests that smoke_ against the skies
1166,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Down on a bark.
1167,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1168,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'Elaine'.
1169,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1170,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1171,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"That beech will _gather brown_,"
1172,7. POLITICAL GROUP,This _maple burn itself away_.
1173,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1174,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'In Memoriam'.
1175,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1176,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1177,7. POLITICAL GROUP,The _wide-wing'd sunset_ of the misty marsh.
1178,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1179,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'Last Tournament'.
1180,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1181,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1182,7. POLITICAL GROUP,But illustrations would be endless. Nothing seems to escape him in
1183,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Nature. Take the following:--
1184,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1185,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1186,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Like _a purple beech among the greens
1187,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Looks out of place_.
1188,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1189,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'Edwin Morris'.
1190,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1191,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1192,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Or
1193,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1194,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Delays _as the tender ash delays
1195,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"To clothe herself, when all the woods are green_."
1196,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1197,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'The Princess'.
1198,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1199,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1200,7. POLITICAL GROUP,As _black as ash-buds in the front of March_.
1201,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1202,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'The Gardener's Daughter'.
1203,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1204,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1205,7. POLITICAL GROUP,A gusty April morn
1206,7. POLITICAL GROUP,That _puff'd_ the swaying _branches into smoke_.
1207,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1208,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'Holy Grail'.
1209,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1210,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1211,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"So with flowers, trees, birds and insects:--"
1212,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1213,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1214,7. POLITICAL GROUP,The fox-glove _clusters dappled bells_.
1215,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1216,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'The Two Voices'.
1217,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1218,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1219,7. POLITICAL GROUP,The sunflower:--
1220,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1221,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1222,7. POLITICAL GROUP,_Rays round with flame its disk of seed_.
1223,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1224,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'In Memoriam'.
1225,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1226,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1227,7. POLITICAL GROUP,The dog-rose:--
1228,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1229,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1230,7. POLITICAL GROUP,_Tufts of rosy-tinted snow_.
1231,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1232,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'Two Voices'.
1233,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1234,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1235,7. POLITICAL GROUP,A _million emeralds_ break from the _ruby-budded lime_.
1236,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1237,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'Maud'.
1238,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1239,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1240,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"In gloss and hue the chestnut, _when the shell"
1241,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Divides threefold to show the fruit within_.
1242,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1243,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'The Brook'.
1244,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1245,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1246,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Or of a chrysalis:--
1247,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1248,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1249,7. POLITICAL GROUP,And flash'd as those
1250,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"_Dull-coated_ things, _that making slide apart"
1251,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Their dusk wing cases, all beneath there burns"
1252,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"A Jewell'd harness_, ere they pass and fly."
1253,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1254,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'Gareth and Lynette'.
1255,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1256,7. POLITICAL GROUP,So again:--
1257,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1258,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1259,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Wan-sallow, as _the plant that feeds itself,"
1260,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Root-bitten by white lichen_.

1262,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'Id'.
1263,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1264,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1265,7. POLITICAL GROUP,And again:--
1266,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1267,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1268,7. POLITICAL GROUP,All the _silvery gossamers_

1270,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1271,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--'In Memoriam'.
1272,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1273,7. POLITICAL GROUP,

1276,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"clematis,"" ""_creamy_ spray,"" ""_dry-tongued_ laurels"". But whatever he"
1277,7. POLITICAL GROUP,describes is described with the same felicitous vividness. How magical
1278,7. POLITICAL GROUP,is this in the verses to Edward Lear:--
1279,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1280,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1281,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Naiads oar'd
1282,7. POLITICAL GROUP,A _glimmering shoulder_ under _gloom_
1283,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Of _cavern pillars_.
1284,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1285,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1286,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Or this:--
1287,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1288,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1289,7. POLITICAL GROUP,She lock'd her lips: she left me where I stood:
1290,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"""Glory to God,"" she sang, and past afar,"

1296,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1297,7. POLITICAL GROUP,But if in the world of Nature nothing escaped his sensitive and

1304,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Sent to his heart its choicest impulses,"
1305,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1306,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1307,7. POLITICAL GROUP,--he had studied the world of books with not less sympathy and
1308,7. POLITICAL GROUP,attention. In the sense of a profound and extensive acquaintance with
1309,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"all that is best in ancient and modern poetry, and in an extraordinarily"
1310,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"wide knowledge of general literature, of philosophy and theology, of"
1311,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"geography and travel, and of various branches of natural science, he is"
1312,7. POLITICAL GROUP,one of the most erudite of English poets. With the poetry of the Greek
1313,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"and Latin classics he was, like Milton and Gray, thoroughly saturated."
1314,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Its influence penetrates his work, now in indirect reminiscence, now in"
1315,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"direct imitation, now inspiring, now modifying, now moulding. He tells"
1316,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"us in 'The Daisy' how when at Como ""the rich Virgilian rustic measure of"
1317,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"'Lari Maxume'"" haunted him all day, and in a later fragment how, as he"
1318,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"rowed from Desenzano to Sirmio, Catullus was with him. And they and"
1319,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"their brethren, from Homer to Theocritus, from Lucretius to Claudian,"
1320,7. POLITICAL GROUP,always were with him. I have illustrated so fully in the notes and
1321,7. POLITICAL GROUP,elsewhere [1] the influence of the Greek and Roman classics on the poems
1322,7. POLITICAL GROUP,of 1842 that it is not necessary to go into detail here. But a few
1323,7. POLITICAL GROUP,examples of the various ways in which they affected Tennyson's work
1324,7. POLITICAL GROUP,generally may be given. Sometimes he transfers a happy epithet or
1325,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"expression in literal translation, as in:--"
1326,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1327,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1328,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"On either _shining_ shoulder laid a hand,"
1329,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1330,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1331,7. POLITICAL GROUP,which is Homer's epithet for the shoulder--

1355,7. POLITICAL GROUP,which is the 'sicca vox' of the Roman poets. So in 'The Lotos Eaters':--
1356,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1357,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1358,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"His voice was _thin_ as voices from the grave,"
1359,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1360,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1361,7. POLITICAL GROUP,which is Theocritus' voice of Hylas from his watery grave:--

1393,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1394,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"All perfect, finished _to the finger nail_,"

1419,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"This way and that, dividing the swift mind,"
1420,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1421,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1422,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"is an almost literal translation of Virgil's 'Aen'., iv., 285:--"

1424,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Atque animum nunc huc celerem nunc dividit illuc
1425,7. POLITICAL GROUP,

1428,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1429,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Another way in which they affect him is where, without direct imitation,"
1430,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"they colour passages and poems as in 'Oenone', 'The Lotos Eaters',"
1431,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"'Tithonus', 'Tiresias', 'The Death of Oenone', 'Demeter and Persephone',"
1432,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"the passage beginning ""From the woods"" in 'The Gardener's Daughter',"
1433,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"which is a parody of Theocritus, 'Id.', vii., 139 'seq.', while the"
1434,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Cyclops' invocation to Galatea in Theocritus, 'Id.', xi., 29-79, was"
1435,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"plainly the model for the idyll, ""Come down, O Maid,"" in the seventh"
1436,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"section of 'The Princess', just as the tournament in the same poem"
1437,7. POLITICAL GROUP,recalls closely the epic of Homer and Virgil. Tennyson had a wonderful
1438,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"way of transfusing, as it were, the essence of some beautiful passage in"
1439,7. POLITICAL GROUP,a Greek or Roman poet into English. A striking illustration of this
1440,7. POLITICAL GROUP,would be the influence of reminiscences of Virgil's fourth 'Aeneid' on
1441,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"the idyll of 'Elaine and Guinevere'. Compare, for instance, the"
1442,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"following: he is describing the love-wasted Elaine, as she sits brooding"
1443,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"in the lonely evening, with the shadow of the wished-for death falling"
1444,7. POLITICAL GROUP,on her:--
1445,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1446,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"But when they left her to herself again,"
1447,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Death, like a friend's voice from a distant field,"
1448,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Approaching through the darkness, call'd; the owls"
1449,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Wailing had power upon her, and she mix'd"
1450,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Her fancies with the sallow-rifted glooms
1451,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Of evening and the moanings of the wind.
1452,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1453,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1454,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"How exactly does this recall, in a manner to be felt rather than exactly"
1455,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"defined, a passage equally exquisite and equally pathetic in Virgil's"
1456,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"picture of Dido, where, with the shadow of her death also falling upon"
1457,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"her, she seems to hear the phantom voice of her dead husband, and ""mixes"
1458,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"her fancies"" with the glooms of night and the owl's funereal wail:--"
1459,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1460,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Hinc exaudiri voces et verba vocantis

1470,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"complaining, drawing out into a wail its protracted notes.)"
1471,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1472,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Similar passages, though not so striking, would be the picture of"
1473,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Pindar's Elysium in 'Tiresias', the sentiment pervading 'The Lotos"
1474,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Eaters' transferred so faithfully from the Greek poets, the scenery in"
1475,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"'none' so crowded with details from Homer, Theocritus and Callimachus."
1476,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Sometimes we find similes suggested by the classical poets, but enriched"
1477,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"by touches from original observation, as here in 'The Princess':--"
1478,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1479,7. POLITICAL GROUP,As one that climbs a peak to gaze
1480,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"O'er land and main, and sees a great black cloud"
1481,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Drag inward from the deeps, a wall of night"
1482,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Blot out the slope of sea from verge to shore.
1483,7. POLITICAL GROUP,...
1484,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"And quenching lake by lake and tarn by tarn Expunge the world,"
1485,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1486,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1487,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"which was plainly suggested by Homer, iv., 275:--"

1493,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1494,7. POLITICAL GROUP,(As when a goat-herd from some hill-peak sees a cloud coming across
1495,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"the deep with the blast of the west wind behind it; and to him, being"
1496,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"as he is afar, it seems blacker, even as pitch, as it goes along the"
1497,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"deep, bringing with it a great whirlwind.)"
1498,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1499,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1500,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"So again the fine simile in 'Elaine', beginning"
1501,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1502,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Bare as a wild wave in the wide North Sea,"
1503,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1504,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1505,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"is at least modelled on the simile in 'Iliad', xv., 381-4, with"
1506,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"reminiscences of the same similes in 'Iliad', xv., 624, and 'Iliad',"
1507,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"iv., 42-56. The simile in the first section of the 'Princess',"
1508,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1509,7. POLITICAL GROUP,As when a field of corn
1510,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Bows all its ears before the roaring East,"
1511,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1512,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1513,7. POLITICAL GROUP,reminds us of Homer's
1514,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1515,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"[Greek: hos d' ote kinaesae Zephyros Bathulaeïon, elthon labros,"
1516,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"epaigixon, epi t' aemuei astachuessin]"

1520,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1521,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1522,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Nothing could be more happy than such an adaptation as the following--
1523,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1524,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Ever fail'd to draw
1525,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"The quiet night into her blood,"
1526,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1527,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1528,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"from Virgil, 'Aen'., iv., 530:--"

1538,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1539,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Arms on which the standing muscle sloped,"
1540,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"As slopes a wild brook o'er a little stone,"
1541,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Running too vehemently to break upon it.

1551,7. POLITICAL GROUP,the mighty eddies.)
1552,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1553,7. POLITICAL GROUP,But there was another use to which Tennyson applied his accurate and
1554,7. POLITICAL GROUP,intimate acquaintance with the classics. It lay in developing what was
1555,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"suggested by them, in unfolding, so to speak, what was furled in their"
1556,7. POLITICAL GROUP,imagery. Nothing is more striking in ancient classical poetry than its
1557,7. POLITICAL GROUP,pregnant condensation. It often expresses in an epithet what might be
1558,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"expanded into a detailed picture, or calls up in a single phrase a whole"
1559,7. POLITICAL GROUP,scene or a whole position. Where in 'Merlin and Vivian' Tennyson
1560,7. POLITICAL GROUP,described
1561,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1562,7. POLITICAL GROUP,The _blind wave feeling round his long sea hall
1563,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"In silence_,"
1564,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1565,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1566,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"he was merely unfolding to its full Homer's [Greek: kuma k_ophon]--""dumb"
1567,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"wave""; just as the best of all comments on Horace's expression, ""Vultus"
1568,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"nimium lubricus aspici,"" 'Odes', I., xix., 8, is given us in Tennyson's"
1569,7. POLITICAL GROUP,picture of the Oread in Lucretius:--
1570,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1571,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1572,7. POLITICAL GROUP,How the sun delights
1573,7. POLITICAL GROUP,To _glance and shift about her slippery sides_.
1574,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1575,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Or take again this passage in the 'Agamemnon', 404-5, describing"
1576,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Menelaus pining in his desolate palace for the lost Helen:--
1577,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1578,7. POLITICAL GROUP,[Greek: pothoi d' uperpontias phasma doxei dom_on anassein.]
1579,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1580,7. POLITICAL GROUP,(And in his yearning love for her who is over the sea a phantom will
1581,7. POLITICAL GROUP,seem to reign over his palace.)
1582,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1583,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1584,7. POLITICAL GROUP,What are the lines in 'Guinevere' but an expansion of what is latent but
1585,7. POLITICAL GROUP,unfolded in the pregnant suggestiveness of the Greek poet:--
1586,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1587,7. POLITICAL GROUP,And in thy bowers of Camelot or of Usk
1588,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Thy shadow still would glide from room to room,"
1589,7. POLITICAL GROUP,And I should evermore be vex'd with thee
1590,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"In hanging robe or vacant ornament,"
1591,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Or ghostly foot-fall echoing on the stair--
1592,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1593,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1594,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"with a reminiscence also perhaps of Constance's speech in 'King John',"
1595,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"III., iv."
1596,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1597,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"It need hardly be said that these particular passages, and possibly some"
1598,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"of the others, may be mere coincidences, but they illustrate what"
1599,7. POLITICAL GROUP,numberless other passages which could be cited prove that Tennyson's
1600,7. POLITICAL GROUP,careful and meditative study of the Greek and Roman poets enabled him to
1601,7. POLITICAL GROUP,enrich his work by these felicitous adaptations.
1602,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1603,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"He used those poets as his master Virgil used his Greek predecessors,"
1604,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"and what the elder Seneca said of Ovid, who had appropriated a line from"
1605,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Virgil, might exactly be applied to Tennyson: ""Fecisse quod in multis"
1606,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"aliis versibus Virgilius fecerat, non surripiendi causâ sed palam"
1607,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"imitandi, hoc animo ut vellet agnosci"".[4]"
1608,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1609,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"He had plainly studied with equal attention the chief Italian poets,"
1610,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"especially Dante, Petrarch, Ariosto and Tasso. On a passage in Dante he"
1611,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"founded his 'Ulysses', and imitations of that master are frequent"
1612,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"throughout his poems. 'In Memoriam', both in its general scheme as"
1613,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"well as in numberless particular passages, closely recalls Petrarch; and"
1614,7. POLITICAL GROUP,Ariosto and Tasso have each influenced his work. In the poetry of his
1615,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"own country nothing seems to have escaped him, either in the masters or"
1616,7. POLITICAL GROUP,the minor poets.[5] To apply the term plagiarism to Tennyson's use of
1617,7. POLITICAL GROUP,his predecessors would be as absurd as to resolve some noble fabric into
1618,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"its stones and bricks, and confounding the one with the other to taunt"
1619,7. POLITICAL GROUP,the architect with appropriating an honour which belongs to the quarry
1620,7. POLITICAL GROUP,and the potter. Tennyson's method was exactly the method of two of the
1621,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"greatest poets in the world, Virgil and Milton, of the poet who stands"
1622,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"second to Virgil in Roman poetry, Horace, of one of the most illustrious"
1623,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"of our own minor poets, Gray."
1624,7. POLITICAL GROUP,
1625,7. POLITICAL GROUP,An artist more fastidious than Tennyson never existed. As scrupulous a
1626,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"purist in language as Cicero, Chesterfield and Macaulay in prose, as"
1627,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"Virgil, Milton, and Leopardi in verse, his care extended to the nicest"
1628,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"minutiae of word-forms. Thus ""ancle"" is always spelt with a ""c"" when it"
1629,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"stands alone, with a ""k"" when used in compounds; thus he spelt ""Idylls"""
1630,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"with one ""l"" in the short poems, with two ""l's"" in the epic poems; thus"
1631,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"the employment of ""through"" or ""thro',"" of ""bad"" or ""bade,"" and the"
1632,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"retention or suppression of ""e"" in past participles are always carefully"
1633,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"studied. He took immense pains to avoid the clash of ""s"" with ""s,"" and"
1634,7. POLITICAL GROUP,to secure the predominance of open vowels when rhythm rendered them
1635,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"appropriate. Like the Greek painter with his partridge, he thought"
1636,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"nothing of sacrificing good things if, in any way, they interfered with"
1637,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"unity and symmetry, and thus, his son tells us, many stanzas, in"
1638,7. POLITICAL GROUP,"themselves of exquisite beauty, have been lost to us."

1681,IV,"Tennyson's place is not among the ""lords of the visionary eye,"" among"
1682,IV,"seers, among prophets, but not the least part of the debt which his"
1683,IV,countrymen owe to him is his dedication of his art to the noblest
1684,IV,purposes. At a time when poetry was beginning to degenerate into what it
1685,IV,"has now almost universally become--a mere sense-pampering siren, and"
1686,IV,"when critics were telling us, as they are still telling us, that we are"
1687,IV,"to understand by it ""all literary production which attains the power of"
1688,IV,"giving pleasure by its form as distinct from its matter,"" he remained"
1689,IV,"true to the creed of his great predecessors. ""L'art pour art,"" he would"
1690,IV,"say, quoting Georges Sand, ""est un vain mot: l'art pour le vrai, l'art"
1691,IV,"pour le beau et le bon, voila la religion que je cherche."" When he"
1692,IV,succeeded to the laureateship he was proud to remember that the wreath
1693,IV,which had descended to him was
1694,IV,
1695,IV,greener from the brows
1696,IV,"Of him that utter'd nothing base,"
1697,IV,
1698,IV,"and he was a loyal disciple of that poet whose aim had been, in his own"
1699,IV,"words, ""to console the afflicted, to add sunshine to daylight by making"
1700,IV,"the happy happier, to teach the young and the gracious of every age to"
1701,IV,"see, to think, to feel, and therefore to become more actively and"
1702,IV,"securely virtuous"". [1] Wordsworth had said that he wished to be"
1703,IV,"regarded as a teacher or as nothing, but unhappily he did not always"
1704,IV,distinguish between the way in which a poet and a philosopher should
1705,IV,"teach. He forgot that the didactic element in a poem should be, to"
1706,IV,"employ a homely illustration, what garlic should be in a salad, ""scarce"
1707,IV,"suspected, animate the whole,"" that the poet teaches not as the moralist"
1708,IV,"and the preacher teach, but as nature and life teach us. He taught us"
1709,IV,"when he wrote 'The Fountain' and 'The Highland Reaper, The"
1710,IV,"Leach-gatherer' and 'Michael', he merely wearied us when he sermonised"
1711,IV,in 'The Excursion' and in 'The Prelude'. Tennyson never makes this
1712,IV,mistake. He is seldom directly didactic. Would he inculcate subjugation
1713,IV,"to the law of duty--he gives us the funeral ode on Wellington, 'The"
1714,IV,"Charge of the Light Brigade', and 'Love and Duty'. Would he inculcate"
1715,IV,"resignation to the will of God, and the moral efficacy of conventional"
1716,IV,Christianity--he gives us 'Enoch Arden'. Would he picture the endless
1717,IV,"struggle between the sensual and the spiritual, and the relation of"
1718,IV,ideals to life--he gives us the 'Idylls of the King'. Would he point to
1719,IV,what atheism may lead--he gives us 'Lucretius'. Poems which are
1720,IV,"masterpieces of sensuous art, such as mere aesthetes, like Rosetti and"
1721,IV,"his school, must contemplate with admiring despair, he makes vehicles of"
1722,IV,the most serious moral and spiritual teaching. 'The Vision of Sin' is
1723,IV,worth a hundred sermons on the disastrous effects of unbridled
1724,IV,profligacy. In 'The Palace of Art' we have the quintessence of 'The Book
1725,IV,of Ecclesiastes' and much more besides. Even in 'The Lotos Eaters' we
1726,IV,have the mirror held up to Hedonism. On the education of the affections
1727,IV,"and on the purity of domestic life must depend very largely, not merely"
1728,IV,"the happiness of individuals, but the well-being of society, and how"
1729,IV,wide a space is filled by poems in Tennyson's works bearing
1730,IV,influentially on these subjects is obvious. And they admit us into a
1731,IV,"pleasaunce with which it is good to be familiar, so pure and wholesome"
1732,IV,"is their atmosphere, so tranquilly beautiful the world in which the"
1733,IV,characters move and the little dramas unfold themselves. They preach
1734,IV,"nothing, but deep into every heart must sink their silent lessons. ""Upon"
1735,IV,"the sacredness of home life,"" writes his son, ""he would maintain that"
1736,IV,the stability and greatness of a nation largely depend; and one of the
1737,IV,secrets of his power over mankind was his true joy in the family duties
1738,IV,"and affections."" What sermons have we in 'The Miller's Daughter', in"
1739,IV,"'Dora', in 'The Gardener's Daughter' and in 'Love and Duty'. 'The"
1740,IV,Princess' was a direct contribution to a social question of momentous
1741,IV,"importance to our time. 'Maud' had an immediate political purpose, while"
1742,IV,in 'In Memoriam' he became the interpreter and teacher of his generation
1743,IV,in a still higher sense.
1744,IV,
1745,IV,"Since Shakespeare no English poet has been so essentially patriotic, or"
1746,IV,appealed so directly to the political conscience of the nation. In his
1747,IV,noble eulogies of the English constitution and of the virtue and wisdom
1748,IV,"of its architects, in his spirit-stirring pictures of the heroic actions"
1749,IV,"of our forefathers and contemporaries both by land and sea, in his"
1750,IV,passionate denunciations of all that he believed would detract from
1751,IV,"England's greatness and be prejudicial to her real interests, in his"
1752,IV,hearty sympathy with every movement and with every measure which he
1753,IV,"believed would contribute to her honour and her power, in all this he"
1754,IV,stands alone among modern poets. But if he loved England as Shakespeare
1755,IV,"loved her, he had other lessons than Shakespeare's to teach her. The"
1756,IV,responsibilities imposed on the England of our time--and no poet knew
1757,IV,this better--are very different from those imposed on the England of
1758,IV,Elizabeth. An empire vaster and more populous than that of the Cæsars
1759,IV,"has since then been added to our dominion. Millions, indeed, who are of"
1760,IV,"the same blood as ourselves and who speak our language have, by the"
1761,IV,"folly of common ancestors, become aliens. But how immense are the realms"
1762,IV,"peopled by the colonies which are still loyal to us, and by the three"
1763,IV,hundred millions who in India own us as their rulers: of this vast
1764,IV,empire England is now the capital and centre. That she should fulfil
1765,IV,completely and honourably the duties to which destiny has called her
1766,IV,"will be the prayer of every patriot, that he should by his own efforts"
1767,IV,contribute all in his power to further such fulfilment must be his
1768,IV,earnest desire. It would be no exaggeration to say that Tennyson
1769,IV,contributed more than any man who has ever lived to what may be called
1770,IV,the higher political education of the English-speaking races. Of
1771,IV,imperial federation he was at once the apostle and the pioneer. In
1772,IV,poetry which appealed as probably no other poetry has appealed to every
1773,IV,"class, wherever our language is spoken, he dwelt fondly on all that"
1774,IV,"constitutes the greatness and glory of England, on her grandeur in the"
1775,IV,"past, on the magnificent promise of the part she will play in the"
1776,IV,"future, if her sons are true to her. There should be no distinction, for"
1777,IV,she recognises no distinction between her children at home and her
1778,IV,children in her colonies. She is the common mother of a common race: one
1779,IV,"flag, one sceptre, the same proud ancestry, the same splendid"
1780,IV,"inheritance. ""How strange England cannot see,"" he once wrote, ""that her"
1781,IV,"true policy lies in a close union with her colonies."""
1782,IV,
1783,IV,"Sharers of our glorious past,"
1784,IV,Shall we not thro' good and ill
1785,IV,Cleave to one another still?
1786,IV,"Britain's myriad voices call,"
1787,IV,Sons be welded all and all
1788,IV,"Into one imperial whole,"
1789,IV,"One with Britain, heart and soul!"
1790,IV,"One life, one flag, one fleet, one Throne!"
1791,IV,
1792,IV,"Thus did the poetry of Tennyson draw closer, and thus will it continue"
1793,IV,"to draw closer those sentimental ties--ties, in Burke's phrase, ""light"
1794,IV,"as air, but strong as links of iron,"" which bind the colonies to the"
1795,IV,"mother country; and in so doing, if he did not actually initiate, he"
1796,IV,"furthered, as no other single man has furthered, the most important"
1797,IV,movement of our time. Nor has any man of genius in the present
1798,IV,"century--not Dickens, not Ruskin--been moved by a purer spirit of"
1799,IV,"philanthropy, or done more to show how little the qualities and actions"
1800,IV,"which dignify humanity depend, or need depend, on the accidents of"
1801,IV,"fortune. He brought poetry into touch with the discoveries of science,"
1802,IV,"and with the speculations of theology and metaphysics, and though, in"
1803,IV,"treating such subjects, his power is not, perhaps, equal to his charm,"
1804,IV,"the debt which his countrymen owe him, even intellectually, is"
1805,IV,incalculable.

2259,MARIANA,
2260,MARIANA,
2261,MARIANA,This poem as we know from the motto prefixed to it was suggested by
2262,MARIANA,"Shakespeare ('Measure for Measure', iii., 1, ""at the moated grange"
2263,MARIANA,"resides this dejected Mariana,"") but the poet may have had in his mind"
2264,MARIANA,the  exquisite fragment of Sappho:--
2265,MARIANA,
2266,MARIANA,"[Greek: deduke men ha selanna kai Plaeïades, mesai de nuktes, para d'"
2267,MARIANA,erchet h'ora ego de mona kateud'o.]

2269,MARIANA,"""The moon has set and the Pleiades, and it is midnight: the hour too"
2270,MARIANA,"is going by, but I sleep alone."""
2271,MARIANA,
2272,MARIANA,It was long popularly supposed that the scene of the poem was a farm
2273,MARIANA,"near Somersby known as Baumber's farm, but Tennyson denied this and said"
2274,MARIANA,"it was a purely ""imaginary house in the fen,"" and that he ""never so much"
2275,MARIANA,"as dreamed of Baumbers farm"". See 'Life', i., 28."

2279,MARIANA,With blackest moss the flower-plots
2280,MARIANA,"Were thickly crusted, one and all:"
2281,MARIANA,The rusted nails fell from the knots
2282,MARIANA,That held the peach [1] to the garden-wall. [2]
2283,MARIANA,The broken sheds look'd sad and strange:
2284,MARIANA,Unlifted was the clinking latch;
2285,MARIANA,Weeded and worn the ancient thatch
2286,MARIANA,Upon the lonely moated grange.
2287,MARIANA,"She only said, ""My life is dreary,"
2288,MARIANA,"He cometh not,"" she said;"

2296,MARIANA,"After the flitting of the bats,"
2297,MARIANA,"When thickest dark did trance the sky,"
2298,MARIANA,"She drew her casement-curtain by,"
2299,MARIANA,And glanced athwart the glooming flats.
2300,MARIANA,"She only said, ""The night is dreary,"
2301,MARIANA,"He cometh not,"" she said;"

2304,MARIANA,
2305,MARIANA,"Upon the middle of the night,"
2306,MARIANA,Waking she heard the night-fowl crow:
2307,MARIANA,The cock sung out an hour ere light:
2308,MARIANA,From the dark fen the oxen's low
2309,MARIANA,"Came to her: without hope of change,"
2310,MARIANA,"In sleep she seem'd to walk forlorn,"
2311,MARIANA,Till cold winds woke the gray-eyed [4] morn
2312,MARIANA,About the lonely moated grange.
2313,MARIANA,"She only said, ""The day is dreary,"

2317,MARIANA,
2318,MARIANA,About a stone-cast from the wall
2319,MARIANA,"A sluice with blacken'd waters slept,"
2320,MARIANA,"And o'er it many, round and small,"
2321,MARIANA,The cluster'd marish-mosses crept.
2322,MARIANA,"Hard by a poplar shook alway,"
2323,MARIANA,All silver-green with gnarled bark:
2324,MARIANA,For leagues no other tree did mark [5]
2325,MARIANA,"The level waste, the rounding gray.[6]"
2326,MARIANA,"She only said, ""My life is dreary,"

2329,MARIANA,"I would that I were dead!"""
2330,MARIANA,
2331,MARIANA,"And ever when the moon was low,"
2332,MARIANA,"And the shrill winds were up and away,[7]"
2333,MARIANA,"In the white curtain, to and fro,"
2334,MARIANA,She saw the gusty shadow sway.
2335,MARIANA,"But when the moon was very low,"
2336,MARIANA,"And wild winds bound within their cell,"
2337,MARIANA,The shadow of the poplar fell
2338,MARIANA,"Upon her bed, across her brow."
2339,MARIANA,"She only said, ""The night is dreary,"
2340,MARIANA,"He cometh not,"" she said;"
2341,MARIANA,"She said, ""I am aweary, aweary,"
2342,MARIANA,"I would that I were dead!"""
2343,MARIANA,
2344,MARIANA,"All day within the dreamy house,"
2345,MARIANA,The doors upon their hinges creak'd;
2346,MARIANA,The blue fly sung in the pane; [8] the mouse
2347,MARIANA,"Behind the mouldering wainscot shriek'd,"
2348,MARIANA,Or from the crevice peer'd about.
2349,MARIANA,"Old faces glimmer'd thro' the doors,"
2350,MARIANA,"Old footsteps trod the upper floors,"
2351,MARIANA,Old voices called her from without.
2352,MARIANA,"She only said, ""My life is dreary,"
2353,MARIANA,"He cometh not,"" she said;"
2354,MARIANA,"She said, ""I am aweary, aweary,"

2356,MARIANA,
2357,MARIANA,"The sparrow's chirrup on the roof,"
2358,MARIANA,"The slow clock ticking, and the sound,"
2359,MARIANA,Which to the wooing wind aloof
2360,MARIANA,"The poplar made, did all confound"
2361,MARIANA,Her sense; but most she loathed the hour
2362,MARIANA,When the thick-moted sunbeam lay
2363,MARIANA,"Athwart the chambers, and the day"
2364,MARIANA,Was sloping [9] toward his western bower.
2365,MARIANA,"Then, said she, ""I am very dreary,"
2366,MARIANA,"He will not come,"" she said;"

4136,THE LADY OF SHALOTT,1842 will be evident from the collation which follows. The text of 1842
4137,THE LADY OF SHALOTT,"became the permanent text, and in this no subsequent material"
4138,THE LADY OF SHALOTT,alterations were made. The poem is more purely fanciful than Tennyson
4139,THE LADY OF SHALOTT,"perhaps was willing to own; certainly his explanation of the allegory,"
4140,THE LADY OF SHALOTT,"as he gave it to Canon Ainger, is not very intelligible: ""The new-born"
4141,THE LADY OF SHALOTT,"love for something, for some one in the wide world from which she has"
4142,THE LADY OF SHALOTT,"been so long excluded, takes her out of the region of shadows into that"
4143,THE LADY OF SHALOTT,"of realities"". Poe's commentary is most to the point: ""Why do some"
4144,THE LADY OF SHALOTT,persons fatigue themselves in endeavours to unravel such phantasy pieces

4148,THE LADY OF SHALOTT,"Tennyson', p. 257) the poem was suggested by an Italian romance upon the"
4149,THE LADY OF SHALOTT,"Donna di Scalotta. On what authority this is said I do not know, nor can"
4150,THE LADY OF SHALOTT,"I identify the novel. In Novella, lxxxi., a collection of novels printed"
4151,THE LADY OF SHALOTT,"at Milan in 1804, there is one which tells but very briefly the story of"
4152,THE LADY OF SHALOTT,"Elaine's love and death, ""Qui conta come la Damigella di scalot mori per"
4153,THE LADY OF SHALOTT,"amore di Lancealotto di Lac,"" and as in this novel Camelot is placed"
4154,THE LADY OF SHALOTT,"near the sea, this may be the novel referred to. In any case the poem is"
4155,THE LADY OF SHALOTT,"a fanciful and possibly an allegorical variant of the story of Elaine,"

4556,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"In the edition of 1833 the poem opened with the following stanza, which"
4557,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,was afterwards excised and the stanza of the present text substituted.
4558,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,
4559,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,
4560,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,Behind the barren hill upsprung
4561,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"With pointed rocks against the light,"
4562,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,The crag sharpshadowed overhung
4563,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,Each glaring creek and inlet bright.
4564,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Far, far, one light blue ridge was seen,"
4565,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,Looming like baseless fairyland;
4566,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Eastward a slip of burning sand,"
4567,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Dark-rimmed with sea, and bare of green,"
4568,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,Down in the dry salt-marshes stood
4569,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,That house dark latticed. Not a breath
4570,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Swayed the sick vineyard underneath,"
4571,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,Or moved the dusty southernwood.
4572,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"""Madonna,"" with melodious moan"
4573,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Sang Mariana, night and morn,"
4574,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"""Madonna! lo! I am all alone,"
4575,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Love-forgotten and love-forlorn."""
4576,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,
4577,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"With one black shadow at its feet,"
4578,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"The house thro' all the level shines,"
4579,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Close-latticed to the brooding heat,"
4580,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,And silent in its dusty vines:
4581,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"A faint-blue ridge upon the right,"
4582,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"An empty river-bed before,"
4583,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"And shallows on a distant shore,"
4584,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,In glaring sand and inlets bright.
4585,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"But ""Ave Mary,"" made she moan,"
4586,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"And ""Ave Mary,"" night and morn,"
4587,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"And ""Ah,"" she sang, ""to be all alone,"
4588,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"To live forgotten, and love forlorn""."
4589,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,
4590,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"She, as her carol sadder grew,"
4591,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,From brow and bosom slowly down [1]
4592,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,Thro' rosy taper fingers drew
4593,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,Her streaming curls of deepest brown
4594,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"To left and right, [2] and made appear,"
4595,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Still-lighted in a secret shrine,"
4596,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Her melancholy eyes divine, [3]"
4597,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,The home of woe without a tear.
4598,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"And ""Ave Mary,"" was her moan, [4]"
4599,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"""Madonna, sad is night and morn"";"
4600,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"And ""Ah,"" she sang, ""to be all alone,"
4601,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"To live forgotten, and love forlorn""."
4602,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,
4603,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Till all the crimson changed, [5] and past"
4604,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Into deep orange o'er the sea,"
4605,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Low on her knees herself she cast,"
4606,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,Before Our Lady murmur'd she;
4607,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Complaining, ""Mother, give me grace"
4608,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"To help me of my weary load""."
4609,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,And on the liquid mirror glow'd
4610,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,The clear perfection of her face.
4611,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"""Is this the form,"" she made her moan,"
4612,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"""That won his praises night and morn?"""
4613,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"And ""Ah,"" she said, ""but I wake alone,"
4614,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"I sleep forgotten, I wake forlorn"". [6]"
4615,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,
4616,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Nor bird would sing, nor lamb would bleat,"
4617,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Nor any cloud would cross the vault,"
4618,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"But day increased from heat to heat,"
4619,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,On stony drought and steaming salt;
4620,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Till now at noon she slept again,"
4621,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"And seem'd knee-deep in mountain grass,"
4622,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"And heard her native breezes pass,"
4623,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,And runlets babbling down the glen.
4624,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"She breathed in sleep a lower moan,"
4625,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"And murmuring, as at night and morn,"
4626,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"She thought, ""My spirit is here alone,"
4627,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Walks forgotten, and is forlorn"". [7]"
4628,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,
4629,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Dreaming, she knew it was a dream:"
4630,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"She felt he was and was not there, [8]"
4631,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,She woke: the babble of the stream
4632,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Fell, and without the steady glare"
4633,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,Shrank one sick willow [9] sere and small.
4634,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,The river-bed was dusty-white;
4635,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,And all the furnace of the light
4636,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,Struck up against the blinding wall. [10]
4637,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"She whisper'd, with a stifled moan"
4638,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"More inward than at night or morn,"
4639,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"""Sweet Mother, let me not here alone"
4640,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Live forgotten, and die forlorn"". [11]"
4641,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,
4642,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"[12] And rising, from her bosom drew"
4643,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Old letters, breathing of her worth,"
4644,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"For ""Love,"" they said, ""must needs be true,"
4645,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"To what is loveliest upon earth""."
4646,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"An image seem'd to pass the door,"
4647,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"To look at her with slight, and say,"
4648,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"""But now thy beauty flows away,"
4649,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"So be alone for evermore""."
4650,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"""O cruel heart,"" she changed her tone,"
4651,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"""And cruel love, whose end is scorn,"
4652,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Is this the end to be left alone,"
4653,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"To live forgotten, and die forlorn!"""
4654,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,
4655,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,But sometimes in the falling day
4656,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"An image seem'd to pass the door,"
4657,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"To look into her eyes and say,"
4658,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"""But thou shalt be alone no more""."
4659,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,And flaming downward over all
4660,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"From heat to heat the day decreased,"
4661,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,And slowly rounded to the east
4662,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,The one black shadow from the wall.
4663,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"""The day to night,"" she made her moan,"
4664,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"""The day to night, the night to morn,"
4665,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,And day and night I am left alone
4666,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"To live forgotten, and love forlorn."""
4667,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,
4668,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"At eve a dry cicala sung,"
4669,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,There came a sound as of the sea;
4670,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Backward the lattice-blind she flung,"
4671,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,And lean'd upon the balcony.
4672,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,There all in spaces rosy-bright
4673,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"Large Hesper glitter'd on her tears,"
4674,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"And deepening thro' the silent spheres,"
4675,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,Heaven over Heaven rose the night.
4676,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"And weeping then she made her moan,"
4677,MARIANA IN THE SOUTH,"""The night comes on that knows not morn,"

5001,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5002,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5003,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,First published in 1833. It was greatly altered when republished in
5004,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"1842, and in some respects, so Fitzgerald thought, not for the better."
5005,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,No alterations of much importance were made in it after 1842. The
5006,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"characters as well as the scenery were, it seems, purely imaginary."
5007,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Tennyson said that if he thought of any mill it was that of Trumpington,"
5008,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"near Cambridge, which bears a general resemblance to the picture here"
5009,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,given.
5010,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5011,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"In the first edition the poem opened with the following stanza, which"
5012,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"the 'Quarterly' ridiculed, and which was afterwards excised. Its"
5013,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"omission is surely not to be regretted, whatever Fitzgerald may have"
5014,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,thought.
5015,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5016,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"I met in all the close green ways,"
5017,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"While walking with my line and rod,"
5018,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"The wealthy miller's mealy face,"
5019,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Like the moon in an ivy-tod.
5020,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,He looked so jolly and so good--
5021,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"While fishing in the milldam-water,"
5022,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"I laughed to see him as he stood,"
5023,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And dreamt not of the miller's daughter.

5025,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,*       *       *       *       *      *
5026,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5027,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5028,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"I see the wealthy miller yet,"
5029,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"His double chin, his portly size,"
5030,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And who that knew him could forget
5031,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,The busy wrinkles round his eyes?
5032,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"The slow wise smile that, round about"
5033,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"His dusty forehead drily curl'd,"
5034,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Seem'd half-within and half-without,"
5035,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And full of dealings with the world?
5036,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5037,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"In yonder chair I see him sit,"
5038,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Three fingers round the old silver cup--
5039,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,I see his gray eyes twinkle yet
5040,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,At his own jest--gray eyes lit up
5041,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,With summer lightnings of a soul
5042,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"So full of summer warmth, so glad,"
5043,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"So healthy, sound, and clear and whole,"
5044,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,His memory scarce can make me [1] sad.
5045,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5046,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Yet fill my glass: give me one kiss:
5047,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"My own sweet [2] Alice, we must die."
5048,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,There's somewhat in this world amiss
5049,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Shall be unriddled by and by.
5050,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"There's somewhat flows to us in life,"
5051,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,But more is taken quite away.
5052,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Pray, Alice, pray, my darling wife, [3]"
5053,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,That we may die the self-same day.
5054,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5055,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Have I not found a happy earth?
5056,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,I least should breathe a thought of pain.
5057,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Would God renew me from my birth
5058,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,I'd almost live my life again.
5059,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"So sweet it seems with thee to walk,"
5060,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And once again to woo thee mine--
5061,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,It seems in after-dinner talk
5062,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Across the walnuts and the wine--[4]
5063,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5064,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,To be the long and listless boy
5065,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Late-left an orphan of the squire,"
5066,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Where this old mansion mounted high
5067,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Looks down upon the village spire: [5]
5068,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"For even here, [6] where I and you"
5069,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Have lived and loved alone so long,"
5070,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Each morn my sleep was broken thro'
5071,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,By some wild skylark's matin song.
5072,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5073,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And oft I heard the tender dove
5074,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,In firry woodlands making moan; [7]
5075,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"But ere I saw your eyes, my love,"
5076,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,I had no motion of my own.
5077,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,For scarce my life with fancy play'd
5078,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Before I dream'd that pleasant dream--
5079,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Still hither thither idly sway'd
5080,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Like those long mosses [8] in the stream.
5081,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5082,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Or from the bridge I lean'd to hear
5083,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"The milldam rushing down with noise,"
5084,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And see the minnows everywhere
5085,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"In crystal eddies glance and poise,"
5086,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,The tall flag-flowers when [9] they sprung
5087,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Below the range of stepping-stones,"
5088,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Or those three chestnuts near, that hung"
5089,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,In masses thick with milky cones. [10]
5090,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5091,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"But, Alice, what an hour was that,"
5092,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,When after roving in the woods
5093,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"('Twas April then), I came and sat"
5094,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Below the chestnuts, when their buds"
5095,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Were glistening to the breezy blue;
5096,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And on the slope, an absent fool,"
5097,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"I cast me down, nor thought of you,"
5098,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,But angled in the higher pool. [11]
5099,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5100,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"A love-song I had somewhere read,"
5101,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"An echo from a measured strain,"
5102,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Beat time to nothing in my head
5103,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,From some odd corner of the brain.
5104,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"It haunted me, the morning long,"
5105,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"With weary sameness in the rhymes,"
5106,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"The phantom of a silent song,"
5107,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,That went and came a thousand times.
5108,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5109,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Then leapt a trout. In lazy mood
5110,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,I watch'd the little circles die;
5111,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"They past into the level flood,"
5112,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And there a vision caught my eye;
5113,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"The reflex of a beauteous form,"
5114,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"A glowing arm, a gleaming neck,"
5115,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,As when a sunbeam wavers warm
5116,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Within the dark and dimpled beck. [12]
5117,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5118,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"For you remember, you had set,"
5119,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"That morning, on the casement's edge [13]"
5120,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"A long green box of mignonette,"
5121,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And you were leaning from the ledge:
5122,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And when I raised my eyes, above"
5123,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,They met with two so full and bright--
5124,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Such eyes! I swear to you, my love,"
5125,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,That these have never lost their light. [14]
5126,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5127,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"I loved, and love dispell'd the fear"
5128,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,That I should die an early death:
5129,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"For love possess'd the atmosphere,"
5130,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And filled the breast with purer breath.
5131,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"My mother thought, What ails the boy?"
5132,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"For I was alter'd, and began"
5133,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"To move about the house with joy,"
5134,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And with the certain step of man.
5135,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5136,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,I loved the brimming wave that swam
5137,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Thro' quiet meadows round the mill,"
5138,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"The sleepy pool above the dam,"
5139,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"The pool beneath it never still,"
5140,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"The meal-sacks on the whiten'd floor,"
5141,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"The dark round of the dripping wheel,"
5142,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,The very air about the door
5143,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Made misty with the floating meal.
5144,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5145,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And oft in ramblings on the wold,"
5146,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"When April nights begin to blow,"
5147,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And April's crescent glimmer'd cold,"
5148,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,I saw the village lights below;
5149,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"I knew your taper far away,"
5150,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And full at heart of trembling hope,"
5151,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"From off the wold I came, and lay"
5152,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Upon the freshly-flower'd slope. [15]
5153,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5154,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,The deep brook groan'd beneath the mill;
5155,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And ""by that lamp,"" I thought ""she sits!"""
5156,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,The white chalk-quarry [16] from the hill
5157,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Gleam'd to the flying moon by fits.
5158,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"""O that I were beside her now!"
5159,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,O will she answer if I call?
5160,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"O would she give me vow for vow,"
5161,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Sweet Alice, if I told her all?"" [17]"
5162,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5163,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Sometimes I saw you sit and spin;
5164,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And, in the pauses of the wind,"
5165,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Sometimes I heard you sing within;
5166,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Sometimes your shadow cross'd the blind.
5167,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"At last you rose and moved the light,"
5168,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And the long shadow of the chair
5169,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Flitted across into the night,"
5170,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And all the casement darken'd there.
5171,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5172,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"But when at last I dared to speak,"
5173,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"The lanes, you know, were white with may,"
5174,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Your ripe lips moved not, but your cheek"
5175,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Flush'd like the coming of the day; [18]
5176,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And so it was--half-sly, half-shy, [19]"
5177,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"You would, and would not, little one!"
5178,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Although I pleaded tenderly,"
5179,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And you and I were all alone.
5180,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5181,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And slowly was my mother brought
5182,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,To yield consent to my desire:
5183,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"She wish'd me happy, but she thought"
5184,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,I might have look'd a little higher;
5185,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And I was young--too young to wed:
5186,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"""Yet must I love her for your sake;"
5187,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Go fetch your Alice here,"" she said:"
5188,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Her eyelid quiver'd as she spake.
5189,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5190,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And down I went to fetch my bride:
5191,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"But, Alice, you were ill at ease;"
5192,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"This dress and that by turns you tried,"
5193,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Too fearful that you should not please.
5194,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"I loved you better for your fears,"
5195,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,I knew you could not look but well;
5196,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And dews, that would have fall'n in tears,"
5197,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,I kiss'd away before they fell. [20]
5198,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5199,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"I watch'd the little flutterings,"
5200,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,The doubt my mother would not see;
5201,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"She spoke at large of many things,"
5202,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And at the last she spoke of me;
5203,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And turning look'd upon your face,"
5204,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"As near this door you sat apart,"
5205,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And rose, and, with a silent grace"
5206,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Approaching, press'd you heart to heart. [21]"
5207,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5208,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Ah, well--but sing the foolish song"
5209,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"I gave you, Alice, on the day [22]"
5210,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"When, arm in arm, we went along,"
5211,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"A pensive pair, and you were gay,"
5212,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"With bridal flowers--that I may seem,"
5213,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"As in the nights of old, to lie"
5214,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Beside the mill-wheel in the stream,"
5215,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,While those full chestnuts whisper by. [23]
5216,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5217,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"It is the miller's daughter,"
5218,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And she is grown so dear, so dear,"
5219,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,That I would be the jewel
5220,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,That trembles at [24] her ear:
5221,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"For hid in ringlets day and night,"
5222,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,I'd touch her neck so warm and white.
5223,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5224,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And I would be the girdle
5225,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"About her dainty, dainty waist,"
5226,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And her heart would beat against me,"
5227,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,In sorrow and in rest:
5228,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And I should know if it beat right,"
5229,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,I'd clasp it round so close and tight. [25]
5230,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5231,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And I would be the necklace,"
5232,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And all day long to fall and rise [26]
5233,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Upon her balmy bosom,"
5234,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"With her laughter or her sighs,"
5235,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And I would lie so light, so light, [27]"
5236,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,I scarce should be [28] unclasp'd at night.
5237,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5238,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"A trifle, sweet! which true love spells"
5239,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,True love interprets--right alone.
5240,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"His light upon the letter dwells,"
5241,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,For all the spirit is his own. [29]
5242,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"So, if I waste words now, in truth"
5243,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,You must blame Love. His early rage
5244,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Had force to make me rhyme in youth
5245,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And makes me talk too much in age. [30]
5246,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5247,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And now those vivid hours are gone,"
5248,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Like mine own life to me thou art,"
5249,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Where Past and Present, wound in one,"
5250,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Do make a garland for the heart:
5251,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"So sing [31] that other song I made,"
5252,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Half anger'd with my happy lot,"
5253,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"The day, when in the chestnut shade"
5254,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,I found the blue Forget-me-not. [32]
5255,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5256,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Love that hath us in the net, [33]"
5257,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Can he pass, and we forget?"
5258,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Many suns arise and set.
5259,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Many a chance the years beget.
5260,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Love the gift is Love the debt.
5261,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Even so.
5262,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Love is hurt with jar and fret.
5263,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Love is made a vague regret.
5264,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Eyes with idle tears are wet.
5265,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Idle habit links us yet.
5266,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,What is love? for we forget:
5267,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Ah, no! no!  [34]"
5268,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5269,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Look thro' mine eyes with thine. True wife,"
5270,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Round my true heart thine arms entwine;
5271,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"My other dearer life in life,"
5272,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Look thro' my very soul with thine!
5273,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Untouch'd with any shade of years,"
5274,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,May those kind eyes for ever dwell!
5275,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"They have not shed a many tears,"
5276,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Dear eyes, since first I knew them well."
5277,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5278,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Yet tears they shed: they had their part
5279,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Of sorrow: for when time was ripe,"
5280,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,The still affection of the heart
5281,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Became an outward breathing type,"
5282,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"That into stillness past again,"
5283,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,And left a want unknown before;
5284,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Although the loss that brought us pain,"
5285,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,That loss but made us love the more.
5286,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5287,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"With farther lookings on. The kiss,"
5288,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"The woven arms, seem but to be"
5289,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Weak symbols of the settled bliss,"
5290,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"The comfort, I have found in thee:"
5291,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"But that God bless thee, dear--who wrought"
5292,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Two spirits to one equal mind--
5293,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"With blessings beyond hope or thought,"
5294,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,With blessings which no words can find.
5295,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,
5296,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Arise, and let us wander forth,"
5297,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,To yon old mill across the wolds;
5298,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"For look, the sunset, south and north, [35]"
5299,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"Winds all the vale in rosy folds,"
5300,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,"And fires your narrow casement glass,"
5301,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Touching the sullen pool below:
5302,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,On the chalk-hill the bearded grass
5303,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,Is dry and dewless. Let us go.
5304,THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER,

5623,FATIMA,
5624,FATIMA,The title was prefixed in 1842; it is a name taken from 'The Arabian
5625,FATIMA,Nights' or from the Moallâkat. The poem was evidently inspired by
5626,FATIMA,Sappho's great ode. 'Cf.' also Fragment I. of Ibycus. In the intensity

6421,THE SISTERS,

6536,THE PALACE OF ART,"First published in 1833, but altered so extensively on its republication"
6537,THE PALACE OF ART,in 1842 as to be practically rewritten. The alterations in it after 1842
6538,THE PALACE OF ART,"were not numerous, consisting chiefly in the deletion of two stanzas"
6539,THE PALACE OF ART,after line 192 and the insertion of the three stanzas which follow in
6540,THE PALACE OF ART,"the present text, together with other minor verbal corrections, all of"
6541,THE PALACE OF ART,which have been noted. No alterations were made in the text after 1853.
6542,THE PALACE OF ART,"The allegory Tennyson explains in the dedicatory verses, but the"
6543,THE PALACE OF ART,framework of the poem was evidently suggested by 'Ecclesiastes' ii.
6544,THE PALACE OF ART,1-17. The position of the hero is precisely that of Solomon. Both began
6545,THE PALACE OF ART,by assuming that man is self-sufficing and the world sufficient; the
6546,THE PALACE OF ART,"verdict of the one in consequence being ""vanity of vanities, all is"
6547,THE PALACE OF ART,"vanity,"" of the other what the poet here records. An admirable"
6548,THE PALACE OF ART,commentary on the poem is afforded by Matthew Arnold's picture of the
6549,THE PALACE OF ART,Romans before Christ taught the secret of the only real happiness
6550,THE PALACE OF ART,possible to man. See 'Obermann Once More'. The teaching of the poem
6551,THE PALACE OF ART,"has been admirably explained by Spedding. It ""represents allegorically"
6552,THE PALACE OF ART,"the condition of a mind which, in the love of beauty and the triumphant"
6553,THE PALACE OF ART,"consciousness of knowledge and intellectual supremacy, in the intense"
6554,THE PALACE OF ART,"enjoyment of its own power and glory, has lost sight of its relation to"
6555,THE PALACE OF ART,"man and God"". See 'Tennyson's Life', vol. i., p. 226."

7928,CHORIC SONG,While all things else have rest from weariness?
7929,CHORIC SONG,"All things have rest: why should we toil alone,"
7930,CHORIC SONG,"We only toil, who are the first of things,"
7931,CHORIC SONG,"And make perpetual moan,"
7932,CHORIC SONG,Still from one sorrow to another thrown:
7933,CHORIC SONG,"Nor ever fold our wings,"
7934,CHORIC SONG,"And cease from wanderings,"
7935,CHORIC SONG,Nor steep our brows in slumber's holy balm;
7936,CHORIC SONG,"Nor harken what the inner spirit sings,"
7937,CHORIC SONG,"""There is no joy but calm!"""

7943,CHORIC SONG,"Lo! in the middle of the wood,"
7944,CHORIC SONG,The folded leaf is woo'd from out the bud
7945,CHORIC SONG,"With winds upon the branch, and there"
7946,CHORIC SONG,"Grows green and broad, and takes no care,"
7947,CHORIC SONG,"Sun-steep'd at noon, and in the moon"
7948,CHORIC SONG,Nightly dew-fed; and turning yellow
7949,CHORIC SONG,"Falls, and floats adown the air."
7950,CHORIC SONG,"Lo! sweeten'd with the summer light,"
7951,CHORIC SONG,"The full-juiced apple, waxing over-mellow,"
7952,CHORIC SONG,Drops in a silent autumn night.

7964,CHORIC SONG,Should life all labour be?
7965,CHORIC SONG,Let us alone.
7966,CHORIC SONG,"Time driveth onward fast,"
7967,CHORIC SONG,And in a little while our lips are dumb.
7968,CHORIC SONG,Let us alone.
7969,CHORIC SONG,What is it that will last?
7970,CHORIC SONG,"All things are taken from us, and become"
7971,CHORIC SONG,Portions and parcels of the dreadful Past.
7972,CHORIC SONG,Let us alone.
7973,CHORIC SONG,What pleasure can we have
7974,CHORIC SONG,To war with evil? Is there any peace
7975,CHORIC SONG,In ever climbing up the climbing wave? [2]
7976,CHORIC SONG,"All things have rest, and ripen toward the grave [3]"

7984,CHORIC SONG,With half-shut eyes ever to seem
7985,CHORIC SONG,Falling asleep in a half-dream!
7986,CHORIC SONG,"To dream and dream, like yonder amber light,"
7987,CHORIC SONG,Which will not leave the myrrh-bush on the height;
7988,CHORIC SONG,To hear each other's whisper'd speech:
7989,CHORIC SONG,"Eating the Lotos day by day,"
7990,CHORIC SONG,"To watch the crisping ripples on the beach,"
7991,CHORIC SONG,And tender curving lines of creamy spray;
7992,CHORIC SONG,To lend our hearts and spirits wholly
7993,CHORIC SONG,To the influence of mild-minded melancholy;
7994,CHORIC SONG,"To muse and brood and live again in memory,"
7995,CHORIC SONG,With those [4] old faces of our infancy
7996,CHORIC SONG,"Heap'd over with a mound of grass,"

8002,CHORIC SONG,"Dear is the memory of our wedded lives,"
8003,CHORIC SONG,And dear the last embraces of our wives
8004,CHORIC SONG,And their warm tears: but all hath suffer'd change;
8005,CHORIC SONG,For surely now our household hearths are cold:
8006,CHORIC SONG,Our sons inherit us: our looks are strange:
8007,CHORIC SONG,And we should come like ghosts to trouble joy.
8008,CHORIC SONG,Or else the island princes over-bold
8009,CHORIC SONG,"Have eat our substance, and the minstrel sings"
8010,CHORIC SONG,"Before them of the ten-years' war in Troy,"
8011,CHORIC SONG,"And our great deeds, as half-forgotten things."
8012,CHORIC SONG,Is there confusion in the little isle? [5]

8014,CHORIC SONG,The Gods are hard to reconcile:
8015,CHORIC SONG,'Tis hard to settle order once again.
8016,CHORIC SONG,"There 'is' confusion worse than death,"
8017,CHORIC SONG,"Trouble on trouble, pain on pain,"
8018,CHORIC SONG,"Long labour unto aged breath,"
8019,CHORIC SONG,Sore task to hearts worn out with [6] many wars
8020,CHORIC SONG,And eyes grow dim with gazing on the pilot-stars.[7]

8025,CHORIC SONG,"But, propt on beds [8] of amaranth and moly,"
8026,CHORIC SONG,"How sweet (while warm airs lull us, blowing lowly)"
8027,CHORIC SONG,"With half-dropt eyelids still,"
8028,CHORIC SONG,"Beneath a heaven dark and holy,"
8029,CHORIC SONG,To watch the long bright river drawing slowly
8030,CHORIC SONG,His waters from the purple hill--
8031,CHORIC SONG,To hear the dewy echoes calling
8032,CHORIC SONG,From cave to cave thro' the thick-twined vine--
8033,CHORIC SONG,To watch [9] the emerald-colour'd water falling
8034,CHORIC SONG,Thro' many a wov'n acanthus-wreath divine!
8035,CHORIC SONG,"Only to hear and see the far-off sparkling brine,"

8042,CHORIC SONG,The Lotos blows by every winding creek:
8043,CHORIC SONG,All day the wind breathes low with mellower tone:
8044,CHORIC SONG,Thro' every hollow cave and alley lone
8045,CHORIC SONG,Round and round the spicy downs the yellow Lotos-dust is blown.
8046,CHORIC SONG,"We have had enough of action, and of motion we,"
8047,CHORIC SONG,"Roll'd to starboard, roll'd to larboard, when the surge was seething"
8048,CHORIC SONG,"free,"
8049,CHORIC SONG,Where the wallowing monster spouted his foam-fountains in the sea.
8050,CHORIC SONG,"Let us swear an oath, and keep it with an equal mind,"
8051,CHORIC SONG,In the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie reclined
8052,CHORIC SONG,"On the hills like Gods together, careless of mankind."
8053,CHORIC SONG,"For they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are hurl'd"
8054,CHORIC SONG,"Far below them in the valleys, and the clouds are lightly curl'd"
8055,CHORIC SONG,"Round their golden houses, girdled with the gleaming world:"

8061,CHORIC SONG,"But they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful song"
8062,CHORIC SONG,"Steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong,"
8063,CHORIC SONG,Like a tale of little meaning tho' the words are strong;
8064,CHORIC SONG,"Chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil,"
8065,CHORIC SONG,"Sow the seed, and reap the harvest with enduring toil,"
8066,CHORIC SONG,"Storing yearly little dues of wheat, and wine and oil;"
8067,CHORIC SONG,"Till they perish and they suffer--some,'tis whisper'd--down in hell"
8068,CHORIC SONG,"Suffer endless anguish, others in Elysian valleys dwell,"
8069,CHORIC SONG,Resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel.
8070,CHORIC SONG,"Surely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore"
8071,CHORIC SONG,"Than labour in the deep mid-ocean, wind and wave and oar;"

8159,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8160,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,First published in 1833 but very extensively altered on its
8161,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"republication in 1842. It had been written by June, 1832, and appears to"
8162,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,have been originally entitled 'Legend of Fair Women' (see Spedding's
8163,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"letter dated 21st June, 1832, 'Life', i., 116). In nearly every edition"
8164,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"between 1833 and 1853 it was revised, and perhaps no poem proves more"
8165,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,strikingly the scrupulous care which Tennyson took to improve what he
8166,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"thought susceptible of improvement. The work which inspired it,"
8167,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"Chaucer's 'Legend of Good Women', was written about 1384, thus"
8168,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"""preluding"" by nearly two hundred years the ""spacious times of great"
8169,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"Elizabeth"". There is no resemblance between the poems beyond the fact"
8170,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,that both are visions and both have as their heroines illustrious women
8171,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,who have been unfortunate. Cleopatra is the only one common to the two
8172,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,poems. Tennyson's is an exquisite work of art--the transition from the
8173,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,anarchy of dreams to the dreamland landscape and to the sharply penned
8174,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,figures--the skill with which the heroines (what could be more perfect
8175,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,that Cleopatra and Jephtha's daughter?) are chosen and contrasted--the
8176,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,wonderful way in which the Iphigenia of Euripides and Lucretius and the
8177,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Cleopatra of Shakespeare are realised are alike admirable. The poem
8178,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"opened in 1833 with the following strangely irrelevant verses, excised"
8179,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"in 1842, which as Fitzgerald observed ""make a perfect poem by themselves"
8180,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"without affecting the 'dream '"":--"
8181,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8182,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"As when a man, that sails in a balloon,"
8183,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Downlooking sees the solid shining ground

8185,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"Tilth, hamlet, mead and mound:"

8213,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8214,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"And, for a while, the knowledge of his art"

8220,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"In every land I saw, wherever light illumineth,"
8221,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Beauty and anguish walking hand in hand
8222,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,The downward slope to death. [2]
8223,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8224,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Those far-renowned brides of ancient song
8225,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"Peopled the hollow dark, like burning stars,"
8226,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"And I heard sounds of insult, shame, and wrong,"
8227,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,And trumpets blown for wars;
8228,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8229,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,And clattering flints batter'd with clanging hoofs:
8230,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,And I saw crowds in column'd sanctuaries;
8231,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,And forms that pass'd [3] at windows and on roofs
8232,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Of marble palaces;
8233,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8234,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Corpses across the threshold; heroes tall
8235,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Dislodging pinnacle and parapet
8236,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Upon the tortoise creeping to the wall; [4]
8237,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Lances in ambush set;
8238,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8239,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,And high shrine-doors burst thro' with heated blasts
8240,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,That run before the fluttering tongues of fire;
8241,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"White surf wind-scatter'd over sails and masts,"
8242,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,And ever climbing higher;
8243,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8244,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"Squadrons and squares of men in brazen plates,"
8245,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"Scaffolds, still sheets of water, divers woes,"
8246,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"Ranges of glimmering vaults with iron grates,"
8247,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,And hush'd seraglios.
8248,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8249,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"So shape chased shape as swift as, when to land"
8250,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"Bluster the winds and tides the self-same way,"
8251,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"Crisp foam-flakes scud along the level sand,"
8252,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Torn from the fringe of spray.
8253,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8254,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"I started once, or seem'd to start in pain,"
8255,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"Resolved on noble things, and strove to speak,"
8256,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"As when a great thought strikes along the brain,"
8257,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,And flushes all the cheek.
8258,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8259,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"And once my arm was lifted to hew down,"
8260,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"A cavalier from off his saddle-bow,"
8261,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,That bore a lady from a leaguer'd town;
8262,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"And then, I know not how,"
8263,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8264,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"All those sharp fancies, by down-lapsing thought"
8265,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"Stream'd onward, lost their edges, and did creep"
8266,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"Roll'd on each other, rounded, smooth'd and brought"
8267,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Into the gulfs of sleep.
8268,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8269,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,At last methought that I had wander'd far
8270,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"In an old wood: fresh-wash'd in coolest dew,"
8271,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,The maiden splendours of the morning star
8272,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Shook in the steadfast [5] blue.
8273,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8274,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Enormous elmtree-boles did stoop and lean
8275,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Upon the dusky brushwood underneath
8276,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"Their broad curved branches, fledged with clearest green,"
8277,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,New from its silken sheath.
8278,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8279,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"The dim red morn had died, her journey done,"
8280,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"And with dead lips smiled at the twilight plain,"
8281,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"Half-fall'n across the threshold of the sun,"
8282,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Never to rise again.
8283,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8284,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"There was no motion in the dumb dead air,"
8285,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Not any song of bird or sound of rill;
8286,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Gross darkness of the inner sepulchre
8287,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Is not so deadly still
8288,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8289,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,As that wide forest.
8290,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Growths of jasmine turn'd
8291,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"Their humid arms festooning tree to tree, [6]"
8292,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,And at the root thro' lush green grasses burn'd
8293,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,The red anemone.
8294,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8295,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"I knew the flowers, I knew the leaves, I knew"
8296,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,The tearful glimmer of the languid dawn
8297,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"On those long, rank, dark wood-walks, drench'd in dew,"
8298,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Leading from lawn to lawn.
8299,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8300,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,"The smell of violets, hidden in the green,"
8301,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Pour'd back into my empty soul and frame
8302,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,The times when I remember to have been
8303,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,Joyful and free from blame.
8304,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,
8305,A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN,And from within me a clear under-tone

9012,TO J. S.,First published in 1833.
9013,TO J. S.,
9014,TO J. S.,This beautiful poem was addressed to James Spedding on the death of his
9015,TO J. S.,brother Edward.
9016,TO J. S.,
9017,TO J. S.,"The wind, that beats the mountain, blows"
9018,TO J. S.,"More softly round the open wold, [1]"
9019,TO J. S.,And gently comes the world to those
9020,TO J. S.,That are cast in gentle mould.
9021,TO J. S.,
9022,TO J. S.,"And me this knowledge bolder made,"
9023,TO J. S.,Or else I had not dared to flow [2]
9024,TO J. S.,"In these words toward you, and invade"
9025,TO J. S.,Even with a verse your holy woe.
9026,TO J. S.,
9027,TO J. S.,"'Tis strange that those we lean on most,"
9028,TO J. S.,"Those in whose laps our limbs are nursed,"
9029,TO J. S.,"Fall into shadow, soonest lost:"
9030,TO J. S.,Those we love first are taken first.
9031,TO J. S.,
9032,TO J. S.,God gives us love. Something to love
9033,TO J. S.,"He lends us; but, when love is grown"
9034,TO J. S.,"To ripeness, that on which it throve"
9035,TO J. S.,"Falls off, and love is left alone."
9036,TO J. S.,
9037,TO J. S.,This is the curse of time. Alas!
9038,TO J. S.,In grief I am not all unlearn'd;
9039,TO J. S.,Once thro' mine own doors Death did pass; [3]
9040,TO J. S.,"One went, who never hath return'd."
9041,TO J. S.,
9042,TO J. S.,He will not smile--nor speak to me
9043,TO J. S.,Once more. Two years his chair is seen
9044,TO J. S.,Empty before us. That was he
9045,TO J. S.,Without whose life I had not been.
9046,TO J. S.,
9047,TO J. S.,Your loss is rarer; for this star
9048,TO J. S.,Rose with you thro' a little arc
9049,TO J. S.,"Of heaven, nor having wander'd far"
9050,TO J. S.,Shot on the sudden into dark.
9051,TO J. S.,
9052,TO J. S.,I knew your brother: his mute dust
9053,TO J. S.,I honour and his living worth:
9054,TO J. S.,A man more pure and bold [4] and just
9055,TO J. S.,Was never born into the earth.
9056,TO J. S.,
9057,TO J. S.,"I have not look'd upon you nigh,"
9058,TO J. S.,Since that dear soul hath fall'n asleep.
9059,TO J. S.,Great Nature is more wise than I:
9060,TO J. S.,I will not tell you not to weep.
9061,TO J. S.,
9062,TO J. S.,"And tho' mine own eyes fill with dew,"
9063,TO J. S.,"Drawn from the spirit thro' the brain, [5]"
9064,TO J. S.,"I will not even preach to you,"
9065,TO J. S.,"""Weep, weeping dulls the inward pain""."
9066,TO J. S.,

9439,THE GOOSE,This was first published in 1842. No alteration has since been made in
9440,THE GOOSE,it.
9441,THE GOOSE,
9442,THE GOOSE,"This poem, which was written at the time of the Reform Bill agitation,"
9443,THE GOOSE,is a political allegory showing how illusory were the supposed
9444,THE GOOSE,advantages held out by the Radicals to the poor and labouring classes.
9445,THE GOOSE,"The old woman typifies these classes, the stranger the Radicals, the"
9446,THE GOOSE,"goose the Radical programme, Free Trade and the like, the eggs such"
9447,THE GOOSE,advantages as the proposed Radical measures might for a time seem to
9448,THE GOOSE,"confer, the cluttering goose, the storm and whirlwind the heavy price"
9449,THE GOOSE,which would have to be paid for them in the social anarchy resulting
9450,THE GOOSE,from triumphant Radicalism. The allegory may be narrowed to the Free
9451,THE GOOSE,Trade question.
9452,THE GOOSE,
9453,THE GOOSE,
9454,THE GOOSE,"I knew an old wife lean and poor,"
9455,THE GOOSE,Her rags scarce held together;
9456,THE GOOSE,"There strode a stranger to the door,"
9457,THE GOOSE,And it was windy weather.
9458,THE GOOSE,
9459,THE GOOSE,"He held a goose upon his arm,"
9460,THE GOOSE,"He utter'd rhyme and reason,"
9461,THE GOOSE,"""Here, take the goose, and keep you warm,"
9462,THE GOOSE,"It is a stormy season""."
9463,THE GOOSE,
9464,THE GOOSE,"She caught the white goose by the leg,"
9465,THE GOOSE,A goose--'twas no great matter.
9466,THE GOOSE,The goose let fall a golden egg
9467,THE GOOSE,With cackle and with clatter.
9468,THE GOOSE,
9469,THE GOOSE,"She dropt the goose, and caught the pelf,"
9470,THE GOOSE,And ran to tell her neighbours;
9471,THE GOOSE,"And bless'd herself, and cursed herself,"
9472,THE GOOSE,And rested from her labours.
9473,THE GOOSE,
9474,THE GOOSE,"And feeding high, and living soft,"
9475,THE GOOSE,Grew plump and able-bodied;
9476,THE GOOSE,"Until the grave churchwarden doff'd,"
9477,THE GOOSE,The parson smirk'd and nodded.
9478,THE GOOSE,
9479,THE GOOSE,"So sitting, served by man and maid,"
9480,THE GOOSE,She felt her heart grow prouder:
9481,THE GOOSE,"But, ah! the more the white goose laid"
9482,THE GOOSE,It clack'd and cackled louder.
9483,THE GOOSE,
9484,THE GOOSE,"It clutter'd here, it chuckled there;"
9485,THE GOOSE,It stirr'd the old wife's mettle:
9486,THE GOOSE,"She shifted in her elbow-chair,"
9487,THE GOOSE,And hurl'd the pan and kettle.
9488,THE GOOSE,
9489,THE GOOSE,"""A quinsy choke thy cursed note!"""
9490,THE GOOSE,Then wax'd her anger stronger:
9491,THE GOOSE,"""Go, take the goose, and wring her throat,"
9492,THE GOOSE,"I will not bear it longer""."
9493,THE GOOSE,
9494,THE GOOSE,"Then yelp'd the cur, and yawl'd the cat;"
9495,THE GOOSE,"Ran Gaffer, stumbled Gammer."
9496,THE GOOSE,"The goose flew this way and flew that,"
9497,THE GOOSE,And fill'd the house with clamour.
9498,THE GOOSE,
9499,THE GOOSE,As head and heels upon the floor
9500,THE GOOSE,"They flounder'd all together,"
9501,THE GOOSE,"There strode a stranger to the door,"
9502,THE GOOSE,And it was windy weather:
9503,THE GOOSE,
9504,THE GOOSE,"He took the goose upon his arm,"
9505,THE GOOSE,He utter'd words of scorning;
9506,THE GOOSE,"""So keep you cold, or keep you warm,"
9507,THE GOOSE,"It is a stormy morning""."
9508,THE GOOSE,
9509,THE GOOSE,"The wild wind rang from park and plain,"
9510,THE GOOSE,"And round the attics rumbled,"
9511,THE GOOSE,"Till all the tables danced again,"
9512,THE GOOSE,And half the chimneys tumbled.
9513,THE GOOSE,
9514,THE GOOSE,"The glass blew in, the fire blew out,"
9515,THE GOOSE,The blast was hard and harder.
9516,THE GOOSE,"Her cap blew off, her gown blew up,"
9517,THE GOOSE,And a whirlwind clear'd the larder;
9518,THE GOOSE,
9519,THE GOOSE,And while on all sides breaking loose
9520,THE GOOSE,"Her household fled the danger,"
9521,THE GOOSE,"Quoth she, ""The Devil take the goose,"
9522,THE GOOSE,"And God forget the stranger!"""

9609,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
9610,MORTE D'ARTHUR,This is Tennyson's first study from Malory's 'Morte d'Arthur'. We learn
9611,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"from Fitzgerald that it was written as early as the spring of 1835, for"
9612,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"in that year Tennyson read it to Fitzgerald and Spedding, ""out of a MS."
9613,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"in a little red book,"" and again we learn that he repeated some lines of"
9614,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"it at the end of May, 1835, one calm day on Windermere, adding ""Not bad"
9615,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"that, Fitz., is it?"" ('Life', i., 184). It is here represented as the"
9616,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"eleventh book of an Epic, the rest of which had been destroyed, though"
9617,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Tennyson afterwards incorporated it, adding introductory lines, with"
9618,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"what was virtually to prove an Epic in twelve books, 'The Idylls of the"
9619,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"King'. The substance of the poem is drawn from the third, fourth and"
9620,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"fifth chapters of the twenty-first book of Malory's 'Romance', which is"
9621,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"followed very closely. It is called ""an Homeric echo,"" but the diction"
9622,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"bears a much closer resemblance to that of Virgil than to that of Homer,"
9623,MORTE D'ARTHUR,though the rhythm is perhaps more Homeric than Virgilian. It is
9624,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Tennyson's masterpiece in ""the grand style,"" and is indeed as near"
9625,MORTE D'ARTHUR,perfection as any work of this kind could be. In spite of its singular
9626,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"mixture of simplicity, purely Homeric, and artificiality, at times"
9627,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"ultra-Virgilian, the incongruity never shocks, so noble and impressive"
9628,MORTE D'ARTHUR,is the general effect. The text of 1842 was never subsequently altered
9629,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"except in the spelling of ""mere"" and ""though"" in lines 37, 77, 147, 155,"
9630,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"162, 272, and in the insertion in 1853 of the line:--"
9631,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
9632,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""Across the ridge and pac'd beside the mere."""
9633,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
9634,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
9635,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
9636,MORTE D'ARTHUR,So all day long the noise of battle roll'd
9637,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Among the mountains by the winter sea;
9638,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Until King Arthur's table, man by man,"
9639,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Had fall'n in Lyonness about their Lord,"
9640,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"King Arthur: then, because his wound was deep,"
9641,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,"
9642,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Sir Bedivere, the last of all his knights,"
9643,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And bore him to a chapel nigh the field, [1]"
9644,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"A broken chancel with a broken cross,"
9645,MORTE D'ARTHUR,That stood on a dark strait of barren land.
9646,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"On one side lay the Ocean, and on one"
9647,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Lay a great water, and the moon was full."
9648,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:
9649,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""The sequel of to-day unsolders all"
9650,MORTE D'ARTHUR,The goodliest fellowship of famous knights
9651,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep
9652,MORTE D'ARTHUR,They sleep--the men I loved. I think that we
9653,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Shall never more, at any future time,"
9654,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,"
9655,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Walking about the gardens and the halls
9656,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Of Camelot, as in the days that were."
9657,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"I perish by this people which I made,--"
9658,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Tho' Merlin sware that I should come again
9659,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"To rule once more--but let what will be, be,"
9660,MORTE D'ARTHUR,I am so deeply smitten thro' the helm
9661,MORTE D'ARTHUR,That without help I cannot last till morn.
9662,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Thou therefore take my brand [2] Excalibur,"
9663,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how
9664,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"In those old days, one summer noon, an arm"
9665,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,"
9666,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,"
9667,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Holding the sword--and how I row'd across
9668,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And took it, and have worn it, like a king:"
9669,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And, wheresoever I am sung or told"
9670,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"In aftertime, this also shall be known:"
9671,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"But now delay not: take Excalibur,"
9672,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And fling him far into the middle mere:
9673,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Watch what thou seëst, and lightly bring me word."""
9674,MORTE D'ARTHUR,To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:
9675,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,"
9676,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm."
9677,MORTE D'ARTHUR,A little thing may harm a wounded man.
9678,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,"
9679,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word."""
9680,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept"
9681,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,"
9682,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,"
9683,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang"
9684,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down"
9685,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"By zig-zag paths, and juts of pointed rock,"
9686,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Came on the shining levels of the lake.
9687,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,"
9688,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon,"
9689,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth"
9690,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:
9691,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks, [3]"
9692,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work"
9693,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long
9694,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"That both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood,"
9695,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"This way and that dividing the swift mind, [4]"
9696,MORTE D'ARTHUR,In act to throw: but at the last it seem'd
9697,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd
9698,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"There in the many-knotted waterflags,"
9699,MORTE D'ARTHUR,That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.
9700,MORTE D'ARTHUR,So strode he back slow to the wounded king.
9701,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:
9702,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""Hast thou perform'd my mission which I gave?"
9703,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"""
9704,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
9705,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""I heard the ripple washing in the reeds, [5]"
9706,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And the wild water lapping on the crag."""
9707,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:"
9708,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name,"
9709,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd"
9710,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Thy fëalty, nor like a noble knight:"
9711,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"For surer sign had follow'd, either hand,"
9712,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Or voice, or else a motion of the mere."
9713,MORTE D'ARTHUR,This is a shameful thing for men to lie.
9714,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again [6]"
9715,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing"
9716,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word."""
9717,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Then went Sir Bedivere the second time
9718,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere, [7]"
9719,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Counting the dewy pebbles, fix'd in thought;"
9720,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,"
9721,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"How curiously and strangely chased, he smote"
9722,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"His palms together, and he cried aloud,"
9723,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""And if indeed I cast the brand away,"
9724,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,"
9725,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Should thus be lost for ever from the earth,"
9726,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.
9727,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"What good should follow this, if this were done?"
9728,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey,"
9729,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Seeing obedience is the bond of rule,"
9730,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Were it well to obey then, if a king demand"
9731,MORTE D'ARTHUR,An act unprofitable against himself?
9732,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"The king is sick, and knows not what he does."
9733,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"What record, or what relic of my lord"
9734,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Should be to aftertime, but empty breath"
9735,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And rumours of a doubt? but were this kept,"
9736,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,"
9737,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Some one might show it at a joust of arms,"
9738,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur,"
9739,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake.
9740,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps"
9741,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Upon the hidden bases of the hills."""
9742,MORTE D'ARTHUR,So might some old man speak in the aftertime
9743,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"To all the people, winning reverence."
9744,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"But now much honour and much fame were lost."""
9745,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,"
9746,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And hid Excalibur the second time,"
9747,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And so strode back slow to the wounded King.
9748,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:"
9749,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"""
9750,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
9751,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""I heard the water lapping on the crag,"
9752,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And the long ripple washing in the reeds."""
9753,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:"
9754,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue, [8]"
9755,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!"
9756,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Authority forgets a dying king, [9]"
9757,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Laid widow'd of the power in his eye
9758,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art,"
9759,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,"
9760,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"In whom should meet the offices of all,"
9761,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;
9762,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Either from lust of gold, or like a girl"
9763,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.
9764,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,"
9765,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:"
9766,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,"
9767,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"I will arise and slay thee with my hands."""
9768,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran, [10]"
9769,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged"
9770,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Among the bulrush-beds, and clutch'd the sword,"
9771,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And strongly wheel'd and threw it. The great brand
9772,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,"
9773,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch,"
9774,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,"
9775,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Seen where the moving isles of winter shock
9776,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"By night, with noises of the northern sea."
9777,MORTE D'ARTHUR,So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur:
9778,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm"
9779,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,"
9780,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him"
9781,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Three times, and drew him under in the mere."
9782,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And lightly went the other to the King.
9783,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:"
9784,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""Now see I by thine eyes that this is done."
9785,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?"""
9786,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
9787,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems"
9788,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,"
9789,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,"
9790,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Not tho' I live three lives of mortal men,"
9791,MORTE D'ARTHUR,So great a miracle as yonder hilt.
9792,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;"
9793,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"But when I look'd again, behold an arm,"
9794,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,"
9795,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"That caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him"
9796,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Three times, and drew him under in the mere."""
9797,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:"
9798,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""My end draws nigh;'tis time that I were gone."
9799,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,"
9800,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And bear me to the margin; yet I fear [11]
9801,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die."""
9802,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"So saying, from the pavement he hath rose,"
9803,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,"
9804,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes
9805,MORTE D'ARTHUR,As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere
9806,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Remorsefully regarded thro' his tears,"
9807,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And would have spoken, but he found not words,"
9808,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,"
9809,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,"
9810,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs.
9811,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard,"
9812,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed
9813,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the King,"
9814,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Muttering and murmuring at his ear
9815,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""Quick, quick! I fear it is too late, and I shall die ""."
9816,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,"
9817,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd,"
9818,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Larger than human on the frozen hills.
9819,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"He heard the deep behind him, and a cry"
9820,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Before. His own thought drove him like a goad.
9821,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves
9822,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And barren chasms, and all to left and right"
9823,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based"
9824,MORTE D'ARTHUR,His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang
9825,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels--
9826,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,"
9827,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And the long glories of the winter moon.
9828,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge, [12]"
9829,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,"
9830,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Beneath them; and descending they were ware
9831,MORTE D'ARTHUR,That all the decks were dense with stately forms
9832,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream--by these"
9833,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Three Queens with crowns of gold--and from them rose
9834,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars,"
9835,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And, as it were one voice, an agony"
9836,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Of lamentation, like a wind, that shrills"
9837,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"All night in a waste land, where no one comes,"
9838,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Or hath come, since the making of the world."
9839,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then murmur'd Arthur, ""Place me in the barge,"""
9840,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And to the barge they came. There those three Queens
9841,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept."
9842,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"But she, that rose the tallest of them all"
9843,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,"
9844,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands,"
9845,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And call'd him by his name, complaining loud,"
9846,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And dropping bitter tears against his brow
9847,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white
9848,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And colourless, and like the wither'd moon"
9849,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east;
9850,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops
9851,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls--
9852,MORTE D'ARTHUR,That made his forehead like a rising sun
9853,MORTE D'ARTHUR,High from the däis-throne--were parch'd with dust;
9854,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,"
9855,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.
9856,MORTE D'ARTHUR,So like a shatter'd column lay the King;
9857,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,"
9858,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"From spur to plume a star of tournament,"
9859,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Shot thro' the lists at Camelot, and charged"
9860,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.
9861,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere, [13]"
9862,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?"
9863,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?
9864,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"For now I see the true old times are dead,"
9865,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"When every morning brought a noble chance,"
9866,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And every chance brought out a noble knight.
9867,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Such times have been not since the light that led
9868,MORTE D'ARTHUR,The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.
9869,MORTE D'ARTHUR,But now the whole ROUND TABLE is dissolved
9870,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Which was an image of the mighty world;
9871,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And I, the last, go forth companionless."
9872,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And the days darken round me, and the years,"
9873,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Among new men, strange faces, other minds."""
9874,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And slowly answer'd Arthur from the barge:
9875,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""The old order changeth, yielding place to new,"
9876,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And God fulfils Himself in many ways, [14]"
9877,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.
9878,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me?
9879,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"I have lived my life, and that which I have done"
9880,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"May He within Himself make pure! but thou,"
9881,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"If thou shouldst never see my face again,"
9882,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer
9883,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice"
9884,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Rise like a fountain for me night and day.
9885,MORTE D'ARTHUR,For what are men better than sheep or goats
9886,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"That nourish a blind life within the brain,"
9887,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer"
9888,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Both for themselves and those who call them friend?
9889,MORTE D'ARTHUR,For so the whole round earth is every way
9890,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Bound by gold chains [15] about the feet of God.
9891,MORTE D'ARTHUR,But now farewell. I am going a long way
9892,MORTE D'ARTHUR,With these thou seëst--if indeed I go--
9893,MORTE D'ARTHUR,(For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)
9894,MORTE D'ARTHUR,To the island-valley of Avilion;
9895,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Where falls not hail, or rain, [16] or any snow,"
9896,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies
9897,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard-lawns"
9898,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea, [17]"
9899,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Where I will heal me of my grievous wound."""
9900,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"So said he, and the barge with oar and sail"
9901,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan"
9902,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,"
9903,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood"
9904,MORTE D'ARTHUR,With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere
9905,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Revolving many memories, till the hull"
9906,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn.
9907,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And on the mere the wailing died away.
9908,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
9909,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Here ended Hall, and our last light, that long"
9910,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Had wink'd and threaten'd darkness, flared and fell:"
9911,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"At which the Parson, sent to sleep with sound,"
9912,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And waked with silence, grunted ""Good!"" but we"
9913,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Sat rapt: It was the tone with which he read--
9914,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Perhaps some modern touches here and there
9915,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Redeem'd it from the charge of nothingness--
9916,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Or else we loved the man, and prized his work;"
9917,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"I know not: but we sitting, as I said,"
9918,MORTE D'ARTHUR,The cock crew loud; as at that time of year
9919,MORTE D'ARTHUR,The lusty bird takes every hour for dawn:
9920,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then Francis, muttering, like a man ill-used,"
9921,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""There now--that's nothing!"" drew a little back,"
9922,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And drove his heel into the smoulder'd log,"
9923,MORTE D'ARTHUR,That sent a blast of sparkles up the flue;
9924,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And so to bed; where yet in sleep I seem'd
9925,MORTE D'ARTHUR,To sail with Arthur under looming shores.
9926,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Point after point; till on to dawn, when dreams"
9927,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Begin to feel the truth and stir of day,"
9928,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"To me, methought, who waited with a crowd,"
9929,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"There came a bark that, blowing forward, bore,"
9930,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"King Arthur, like a modern gentleman"
9931,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Of stateliest port; and all the people cried,"
9932,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""Arthur is come again: he cannot die""."
9933,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Then those that stood upon the hills behind
9934,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Repeated--""Come again, and thrice as fair"";"
9935,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And, further inland, voices echoed--"
9936,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""Come With all good things, and war shall be no more""."
9937,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"At this a hundred bells began to peal,"
9938,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"That with the sound I woke, and heard indeed"
9939,MORTE D'ARTHUR,The clear church-bells ring in the Christmas morn.

10088,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",

10091,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",
10092,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",In the 'Gardener's Daughter' we have the first of that delightful series
10093,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","of poems dealing with scenes and characters from ordinary English life,"
10094,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",and named appropriately 'English Idylls'. The originator of this species
10095,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","of poetry in England was Southey, in his 'English Eclogues', written"
10096,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","before 1799. In the preface to these eclogues, which are in blank verse,"
10097,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Southey says: ""The following eclogues, I believe, bear no resemblance to"
10098,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",any poems in our language. This species of composition has become
10099,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","popular in Germany, and I was induced to attempt it by an account of the"
10100,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","German idylls given me in conversation."" Southey's eclogues are eight in"
10101,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","number: 'The Old Mansion House', 'The Grandmother's Tale', 'Hannah',"
10102,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","'The Sailor's Mother', 'The Witch', 'The Ruined Cottage', 'The Last of"
10103,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",the Family' and 'The Alderman's Funeral'. Southey was followed by
10104,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Wordsworth in 'The Brothers' and 'Michael'. Southey has nothing of the
10105,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","charm, grace and classical finish of his disciple, but how nearly"
10106,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Tennyson follows him, as copy and model, may be seen by anyone who"
10107,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",compares Tennyson's studies with 'The Ruined Cottage'. But Tennyson's
10108,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","real master was Theocritus, whose influence pervades these poems not so"
10109,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",much directly in definite imitation as indirectly in colour and tone.
10110,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",
10111,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","'The Gardener's Daughter' was written as early as 1835, as it was read"
10112,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","to Fitzgerald in that year ('Life of Tennyson', i., 182). Tennyson"
10113,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",originally intended to insert a prologue to be entitled 'The
10114,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Antechamber', which contained an elaborate picture of himself, but he"
10115,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","afterwards suppressed it. It is given in the 'Life', i., 233-4. This"
10116,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",poem stands alone among the Idylls in being somewhat overloaded with
10117,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",ornament. The text of 1842 remained unaltered through all the subsequent
10118,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","editions except in line 235. After 1851 the form ""tho'"" is substituted"

10229,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","And on we went; but ere an hour had pass'd,"
10230,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",We reach'd a meadow slanting to the North;
10231,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Down which a well-worn pathway courted us
10232,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",To one green wicket in a privet hedge;

10237,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",The garden stretches southward. In the midst
10238,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",A cedar spread his dark-green layers of shade.
10239,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","The garden-glasses shone, and momently"
10240,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",The twinkling laurel scatter'd silver lights.

10246,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","That, flowering high, the last night's gale had caught,"
10247,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",And blown across the walk. One arm aloft--

10249,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Holding the bush, to fix it back, she stood."
10250,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",A single stream of all her soft brown hair
10251,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Pour'd on one side: the shadow of the flowers
10252,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Stole all the golden gloss, and, wavering"
10253,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Lovingly lower, trembled on her waist--"
10254,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Ah, happy shade--and still went wavering down,"

10259,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Her violet eyes, and all her Hebe-bloom,"
10260,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","And doubled his own warmth against her lips,"
10261,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",And on the bounteous wave of such a breast
10262,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","As never pencil drew. Half light, half shade,"

10271,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","One rose, but one, by those fair fingers cull'd,"
10272,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Were worth a hundred kisses press'd on lips
10273,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Less exquisite than thine."" She look'd: but all"
10274,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Suffused with blushes--neither self-possess'd
10275,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Nor startled, but betwixt this mood and that,"
10276,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Divided in a graceful quiet--paused,"

10285,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Beam'd thro' the thicken'd cedar in the dusk.
10286,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","So home we went, and all the livelong way"
10287,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",With solemn gibe did Eustace banter me.
10288,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","""Now,"" said he, ""will you climb the top of Art;"
10289,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",You cannot fail but work in hues to dim
10290,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",The Titianic Flora. Will you match
10291,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","My Juliet? you, not you,--the Master,"
10292,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Love, A more ideal Artist he than all."""
10293,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",
10294,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","So home I went, but could not sleep for joy,"
10295,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Reading her perfect features in the gloom,"
10296,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Kissing the rose she gave me o'er and o'er,"
10297,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",And shaping faithful record of the glance
10298,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",That graced the giving--such a noise of life
10299,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Swarm'd in the golden present, such a voice"
10300,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Call'd to me from the years to come, and such"
10301,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",A length of bright horizon rimm'd the dark.
10302,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",And all that night I heard the watchmen peal
10303,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",The sliding season: all that night I heard
10304,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",The heavy clocks knolling the drowsy hours.
10305,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","The drowsy hours, dispensers of all good,"
10306,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","O'er the mute city stole with folded wings,"
10307,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Distilling odours on me as they went
10308,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",To greet their fairer sisters of the East.
10309,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",
10310,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Love at first sight, first-born, and heir to all,"
10311,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Made this night thus. Henceforward squall nor storm
10312,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Could keep me from that Eden where she dwelt.
10313,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Light pretexts drew me: sometimes a
10314,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Dutch love For tulips; then for roses, moss or musk,"
10315,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",To grace my city-rooms; or fruits and cream
10316,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Served in the weeping elm; and more and more
10317,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",A word could bring the colour to my cheek;
10318,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",A thought would fill my eyes with happy dew;
10319,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Love trebled life within me, and with each"
10320,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","The year increased. The daughters of the year,"
10321,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","One after one, thro' that still garden pass'd:"
10322,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Each garlanded with her peculiar flower
10323,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Danced into light, and died into the shade;"
10324,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",And each in passing touch'd with some new grace
10325,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Or seem'd to touch her, so that day by day,"
10326,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Like one that never can be wholly known, [6]"
10327,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Her beauty grew; till Autumn brought an hour
10328,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","For Eustace, when I heard his deep ""I will,"""
10329,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Breathed, like the covenant of a God, to hold"
10330,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",From thence thro' all the worlds: but I rose up
10331,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Full of his bliss, and following her dark eyes"
10332,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Felt earth as air beneath me, [7] till I reach'd"
10333,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","The wicket-gate, and found her standing there."
10334,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","There sat we down upon a garden mound,"
10335,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Two mutually enfolded; Love, the third,"
10336,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Between us, in the circle of his arms"
10337,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Enwound us both; and over many a range
10338,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Of waning lime the gray cathedral towers,"
10339,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Across a hazy glimmer of the west,"
10340,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Reveal'd their shining windows: from them clash'd
10341,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",The bells; we listen'd; with the time we play'd;
10342,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",We spoke of other things; we coursed about
10343,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","The subject most at heart, more near and near,"
10344,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Like doves about a dovecote, wheeling round"
10345,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","The central wish, until we settled there. [8]"
10346,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Then, in that time and place, I spoke to her,"
10347,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Requiring, tho' I knew it was mine own,"
10348,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Yet for the pleasure that I took to hear,"
10349,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Requiring at her hand the greatest gift,"
10350,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","A woman's heart, the heart of her I loved;"
10351,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","And in that time and place she answer'd me,"
10352,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","And in the compass of three little words,"
10353,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","More musical than ever came in one,"
10354,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","The silver fragments of a broken voice,"
10355,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Made me most happy, faltering [9] ""I am thine""."
10356,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Shall I cease here? Is this enough to say
10357,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","That my desire, like all strongest hopes,"
10358,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","By its own energy fulfilled itself,"
10359,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Merged in completion? Would you learn at full

10361,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Beyond all grades develop'd? and indeed
10362,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","I had not staid so long to tell you all,"
10363,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","But while I mused came Memory with sad eyes,"
10364,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Holding the folded annals of my youth;
10365,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","And while I mused, Love with knit brows went by,"
10366,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","And with a flying finger swept my lips,"
10367,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","And spake, ""Be wise: not easily forgiven"

10373,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","In whispers, like the whispers of the leaves"
10374,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",That tremble round a nightingale--in sighs
10375,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Which perfect Joy, perplex'd for utterance,"

10377,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Of difference, reconcilement, pledges given,"
10378,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","And vows, where there was never need of vows,"
10379,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","And kisses, where the heart on one wild leap"
10380,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Hung tranced from all pulsation, as above"
10381,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",The heavens between their fairy fleeces pale
10382,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",Sow'd all their mystic gulfs with fleeting stars;
10383,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Or while the balmy glooming, crescent-lit,"
10384,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Spread the light haze along the river-shores,"
10385,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES",And in the hollows; or as once we met
10386,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Unheedful, tho' beneath a whispering rain"
10387,"THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES","Night slid down one long stream of sighing wind,"

10464,DORA,"This poem had been written as early as 1835, when it was read to"
10465,DORA,"Fitzgerald and Spedding ('Life', i., 182). No alterations were made in"
10466,DORA,the text after 1853. The story in this poem was taken even to the
10467,DORA,"minutest details from a prosestory of Miss Mitford's, namely, 'The Tale"
10468,DORA,"of Dora Creswell' ('Our Village', vol. in., 242-53), the only"
10469,DORA,"alterations being in the names, Farmer Cresswell, Dora Creswell, Walter"
10470,DORA,"Cresswell, and Mary Hay becoming respectively Allan, Dora, William, and"
10471,DORA,Mary Morrison. How carefully the poet has preserved the picturesque
10472,DORA,touches of the original may be seen by comparing the following two
10473,DORA,passages:--
10474,DORA,
10475,DORA,"And Dora took the child, and went her way"
10476,DORA,"Across the wheat, and sat upon a mound"
10477,DORA,"That was unsown, where many poppies grew."
10478,DORA,...
10479,DORA,She rose and took
10480,DORA,"The child once more, and sat upon the mound;"
10481,DORA,And made a little wreath of all the flowers
10482,DORA,"That grew about, and tied it round his hat."
10483,DORA,
10484,DORA,"""A beautiful child lay on the ground at some distance, whilst a"
10485,DORA,"young girl, resting from the labour of reaping, was twisting a"
10486,DORA,"rustic wreath of enamelled cornflowers, brilliant poppies ... round"
10487,DORA,"its hat."""
10488,DORA,
10489,DORA,The style is evidently modelled closely on that of the 'Odyssey'.
10490,DORA,
10491,DORA,
10492,DORA,With farmer Allan at the farm abode
10493,DORA,"William and Dora. William was his son,"
10494,DORA,"And she his niece. He often look'd at them,"
10495,DORA,"And often thought ""I'll make them man and wife""."
10496,DORA,"Now Dora felt her uncle's will in all,"
10497,DORA,"And yearn'd towards William; but the youth, because"
10498,DORA,"He had been always with her in the house,"
10499,DORA,Thought not of Dora. Then there came a day
10500,DORA,"When Allan call'd his son, and said,"
10501,DORA,"""My son: I married late, but I would wish to see"
10502,DORA,My grandchild on my knees before I die:
10503,DORA,And I have set my heart upon a match.
10504,DORA,Now therefore look to Dora; she is well
10505,DORA,To look to; thrifty too beyond her age.
10506,DORA,She is my brother's daughter: he and I
10507,DORA,"Had once hard words, and parted, and he died"
10508,DORA,In foreign lands; but for his sake I bred
10509,DORA,His daughter Dora: take her for your wife;
10510,DORA,"For I have wish'd this marriage, night and day,"
10511,DORA,"For many years."" But William answer'd short;"
10512,DORA,"""I cannot marry Dora; by my life,"
10513,DORA,"I will not marry Dora"". Then the old man"
10514,DORA,"Was wroth, and doubled up his hands, and said:"
10515,DORA,"""You will not, boy! you dare to answer thus!"
10516,DORA,"But in my time a father's word was law,"
10517,DORA,And so it shall be now for me. Look to it;
10518,DORA,"Consider, William: take a month to think,"
10519,DORA,And let me have an answer to my wish;
10520,DORA,"Or, by the Lord that made me, you shall pack,"
10521,DORA,"And never more darken my doors again."""
10522,DORA,"But William answer'd madly; bit his lips,"
10523,DORA,And broke away. [1] The more he look'd at her
10524,DORA,The less he liked her; and his ways were harsh;
10525,DORA,But Dora bore them meekly. Then before
10526,DORA,"The month was out he left his father's house,"
10527,DORA,And hired himself to work within the fields;
10528,DORA,"And half in love, half spite, he woo'd and wed"
10529,DORA,"A labourer's daughter, Mary Morrison."
10530,DORA,
10531,DORA,"Then, when the bells were ringing, Allan call'd"
10532,DORA,"His niece and said: ""My girl, I love you well;"
10533,DORA,"But if you speak with him that was my son,"
10534,DORA,"Or change a word with her he calls his wife,"
10535,DORA,"My home is none of yours. My will is law."""
10536,DORA,"And Dora promised, being meek. She thought,"
10537,DORA,"""It cannot be: my uncle's mind will change!"""
10538,DORA,
10539,DORA,"And days went on, and there was born a boy"
10540,DORA,To William; then distresses came on him;
10541,DORA,"And day by day he pass'd his father's gate,"
10542,DORA,"Heart-broken, and his father helped him not."
10543,DORA,"But Dora stored what little she could save,"
10544,DORA,"And sent it them by stealth, nor did they know"
10545,DORA,Who sent it; till at last a fever seized
10546,DORA,"On William, and in harvest time he died."
10547,DORA,
10548,DORA,Then Dora went to Mary. Mary sat
10549,DORA,"And look'd with tears upon her boy, and thought"
10550,DORA,Hard things of Dora. Dora came and said:
10551,DORA,"""I have obey'd my uncle until now,"
10552,DORA,"And I have sinn'd, for it was all thro' me"
10553,DORA,This evil came on William at the first.
10554,DORA,"But, Mary, for the sake of him that's gone,"
10555,DORA,"And for your sake, the woman that he chose,"
10556,DORA,"And for this orphan, I am come to you:"
10557,DORA,You know there has not been for these five years
10558,DORA,"So full a harvest, let me take the boy,"
10559,DORA,And I will set him in my uncle's eye
10560,DORA,Among the wheat; that when his heart is glad
10561,DORA,"Of the full harvest, he may see the boy,"
10562,DORA,"And bless him for the sake of him that's gone."""
10563,DORA,"And Dora took the child, and went her way"
10564,DORA,"Across the wheat, and sat upon a mound"
10565,DORA,"That was unsown, where many poppies grew."
10566,DORA,Far off the farmer came into the field
10567,DORA,And spied her not; for none of all his men
10568,DORA,Dare tell him Dora waited with the child;
10569,DORA,"And Dora would have risen and gone to him,"
10570,DORA,But her heart fail'd her; and the reapers reap'd
10571,DORA,"And the sun fell, and all the land was dark."
10572,DORA,"But when the morrow came, she rose and took"
10573,DORA,"The child once more, and sat upon the mound;"
10574,DORA,And made a little wreath of all the flowers
10575,DORA,"That grew about, and tied it round his hat"
10576,DORA,To make him pleasing in her uncle's eye.
10577,DORA,Then when the farmer passed into the field
10578,DORA,"He spied her, and he left his men at work,"
10579,DORA,"And came and said: ""Where were you yesterday?"
10580,DORA,"Whose child is that? What are you doing here?"""
10581,DORA,"So Dora cast her eyes upon the ground,"
10582,DORA,"And answer'd softly, ""This is William's child?"""
10583,DORA,"""And did I not,"" said Allan, ""did I not"
10584,DORA,"Forbid you, Dora?"" Dora said again:"
10585,DORA,"""Do with me as you will, but take the child"
10586,DORA,"And bless him for the sake of him that's gone!"""
10587,DORA,"And Allan said: ""I see it is a trick"
10588,DORA,Got up betwixt you and the woman there.
10589,DORA,"I must be taught my duty, and by you!"
10590,DORA,"You knew my word was law, and yet you dared"
10591,DORA,To slight it. Well--for I will take the boy;
10592,DORA,"But go you hence, and never see me more."""
10593,DORA,"So saying, he took the boy, that cried aloud"
10594,DORA,And struggled hard. The wreath of flowers fell
10595,DORA,"At Dora's feet. She bow'd upon her hands,"
10596,DORA,"And the boy's cry came to her from the field,"
10597,DORA,"More and more distant. She bow'd down her head,"
10598,DORA,"Remembering the day when first she came,"
10599,DORA,And all the things that had been. She bow'd down
10600,DORA,"And wept in secret; and the reapers reap'd,"
10601,DORA,"And the sun fell, and all the land was dark."
10602,DORA,"Then Dora went to Mary's house, and stood"
10603,DORA,Upon the threshold. Mary saw the boy
10604,DORA,Was not with Dora. She broke out in praise
10605,DORA,"To God, that help'd her in her widowhood."
10606,DORA,"And Dora said, ""My uncle took the boy;"
10607,DORA,"But, Mary, let me live and work with you:"
10608,DORA,"He says that he will never see me more""."
10609,DORA,"Then answer'd Mary, ""This shall never be,"
10610,DORA,That thou shouldst take my trouble on thyself:
10611,DORA,"And, now, I think, he shall not have the boy,"
10612,DORA,"For he will teach him hardness, and to slight"
10613,DORA,"His mother; therefore thou and I will go,"
10614,DORA,"And I will have my boy, and bring him home;"
10615,DORA,And I will beg of him to take thee back;
10616,DORA,"But if he will not take thee back again,"
10617,DORA,"Then thou and I will live within one house,"
10618,DORA,And work for William's child until he grows
10619,DORA,"Of age to help us."" So the women kiss'd"
10620,DORA,"Each other, and set out, and reach'd the farm."
10621,DORA,"The door was off the latch: they peep'd, and saw"
10622,DORA,"The boy set up betwixt his grandsire's knees,"
10623,DORA,"Who thrust him in the hollows of his arm,"
10624,DORA,"And clapt him on the hands and on the cheeks,"
10625,DORA,Like one that loved him; and the lad stretch'd out
10626,DORA,"And babbled for the golden seal, that hung"
10627,DORA,"From Allan's watch, and sparkled by the fire."
10628,DORA,Then they came in: but when the boy beheld
10629,DORA,"His mother, he cried out to come to her:"
10630,DORA,"And Allan set him down, and Mary said:"
10631,DORA,"""O Father!--if you let me call you so--"
10632,DORA,"I never came a-begging for myself,"
10633,DORA,"Or William, or this child; but now I come"
10634,DORA,For Dora: take her back; she loves you well.
10635,DORA,"O Sir, when William died, he died at peace"
10636,DORA,"With all men; for I ask'd him, and he said,"
10637,DORA,He could not ever rue his marrying me--
10638,DORA,"I have been a patient wife: but, Sir, he said"
10639,DORA,That he was wrong to cross his father thus:
10640,DORA,"'God bless him!' he said, 'and may he never know"
10641,DORA,The troubles I have gone thro'!' Then he turn'd
10642,DORA,His face and pass'd--unhappy that I am!
10643,DORA,"But now, Sir, let me have my boy, for you"
10644,DORA,"Will make him hard, and he will learn to slight"
10645,DORA,"His father's memory; and take Dora back,"
10646,DORA,"And let all this be as it was before."""
10647,DORA,"So Mary said, and Dora hid her face"
10648,DORA,By Mary. There was silence in the room;
10649,DORA,And all at once the old man burst in sobs:
10650,DORA,"""I have been to blame--to blame. I have kill'd my son."
10651,DORA,I have kill'd him--but I loved him--my dear son.
10652,DORA,May God forgive me!--I have been to blame.
10653,DORA,"Kiss me, my children.""  Then they clung about"
10654,DORA,"The old man's neck, and kiss'd him many times."
10655,DORA,And all the man was broken with remorse;
10656,DORA,And all his love came back a hundredfold;
10657,DORA,"And for three hours he sobb'd o'er William's child,"
10658,DORA,Thinking of William. So those four abode
10659,DORA,Within one house together; and as years
10660,DORA,"Went forward, Mary took another mate;"
10661,DORA,But Dora lived unmarried till her death.
10662,DORA,
10663,DORA,
10664,DORA,[Footnote 1: In 1842 thus:--
10665,DORA,
10666,DORA,"""Look to't,"
10667,DORA,"Consider: take a month to think, and give"
10668,DORA,An answer to my wish; or by the Lord
10669,DORA,"That made me, you shall pack, and nevermore"
10670,DORA,"Darken my doors again."" And William heard,"
10671,DORA,"And answered something madly; bit his lips,"
10672,DORA,And broke away.

10686,AUDLEY COURT,First published in 1842.
10687,AUDLEY COURT,
10688,AUDLEY COURT,"Only four alterations were made in the text after 1842, all of which are"
10689,AUDLEY COURT,duly noted. Tennyson told his son that the poem was partially suggested
10690,AUDLEY COURT,"by Abbey Park at Torquay where it was written, and that the last lines"
10691,AUDLEY COURT,described the scene from the hill looking over the bay. He saw he said
10692,AUDLEY COURT,"""a star of phosphorescence made by the buoy appearing and disappearing"
10693,AUDLEY COURT,"in the dark sea,"" but it is curious that the line describing that was"
10694,AUDLEY COURT,"not inserted till long after the poem had been published. The poem,"
10695,AUDLEY COURT,"though a trifle, is a triumph of felicitous description and expression,"
10696,AUDLEY COURT,whether we regard the pie or the moonlit bay.
10697,AUDLEY COURT,
10698,AUDLEY COURT,
10699,AUDLEY COURT,"""The Bull, the Fleece are cramm'd, and not a room"
10700,AUDLEY COURT,For love or money. Let us picnic there
10701,AUDLEY COURT,"At Audley Court."" I spoke, while Audley feast"
10702,AUDLEY COURT,"Humm'd like a hive all round the narrow quay,"
10703,AUDLEY COURT,"To Francis, with a basket on his arm,"
10704,AUDLEY COURT,"To Francis just alighted from the boat,"
10705,AUDLEY COURT,"And breathing of the sea. ""With all my heart,"""
10706,AUDLEY COURT,"Said Francis. Then we shoulder'd thro' [1] the swarm,"
10707,AUDLEY COURT,And rounded by the stillness of the beach
10708,AUDLEY COURT,To where the bay runs up its latest horn.
10709,AUDLEY COURT,We left the dying ebb that faintly lipp'd
10710,AUDLEY COURT,The flat red granite; so by many a sweep
10711,AUDLEY COURT,Of meadow smooth from aftermath we reach'd
10712,AUDLEY COURT,The griffin-guarded gates and pass'd thro' all
10713,AUDLEY COURT,The pillar'd dusk [2] of sounding sycamores
10714,AUDLEY COURT,"And cross'd the garden to the gardener's lodge,"
10715,AUDLEY COURT,"With all its casements bedded, and its walls"
10716,AUDLEY COURT,And chimneys muffled in the leafy vine.
10717,AUDLEY COURT,"There, on a slope of orchard, Francis laid"
10718,AUDLEY COURT,"A damask napkin wrought with horse and hound,"
10719,AUDLEY COURT,"Brought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home,"
10720,AUDLEY COURT,"And, half-cut-down, a pasty costly-made,"
10721,AUDLEY COURT,"Where quail and pigeon, lark and leveret lay,"
10722,AUDLEY COURT,"Like fossils of the rock, with golden yolks [3]"
10723,AUDLEY COURT,"Imbedded and injellied; last with these,"
10724,AUDLEY COURT,"A flask of cider from his father's vats,"
10725,AUDLEY COURT,"Prime, which I knew; and so we sat and eat"
10726,AUDLEY COURT,"And talk'd old matters over; who was dead,"
10727,AUDLEY COURT,"Who married, who was like to be, and how"
10728,AUDLEY COURT,"The races went, and who would rent the hall:"
10729,AUDLEY COURT,"Then touch'd upon the game, how scarce it was"
10730,AUDLEY COURT,"This season; glancing thence, discuss'd the farm,"
10731,AUDLEY COURT,"The fourfield system, and the price of grain; [4]"
10732,AUDLEY COURT,"And struck upon the corn-laws, where we split,"
10733,AUDLEY COURT,And came again together on the king
10734,AUDLEY COURT,With heated faces; till he laugh'd aloud;
10735,AUDLEY COURT,"And, while the blackbird on the pippin hung"
10736,AUDLEY COURT,"To hear him, clapt his hand in mine and sang--"
10737,AUDLEY COURT,"""Oh! who would fight and march and counter-march,"
10738,AUDLEY COURT,"Be shot for sixpence in a battle-field,"
10739,AUDLEY COURT,And shovell'd up into a [5] bloody trench
10740,AUDLEY COURT,Where no one knows? but let me live my life.
10741,AUDLEY COURT,"""Oh! who would cast and balance at a desk,"
10742,AUDLEY COURT,"Perch'd like a crow upon a three-legg'd stool,"
10743,AUDLEY COURT,"Till all his juice is dried, and all his joints"
10744,AUDLEY COURT,Are full of chalk? but let me live my life.
10745,AUDLEY COURT,"""Who'd serve the state? for if I carved my name"
10746,AUDLEY COURT,"Upon the cliffs that guard my native land,"
10747,AUDLEY COURT,I might as well have traced it in the sands;
10748,AUDLEY COURT,The sea wastes all: but let me live my life.
10749,AUDLEY COURT,"""Oh! who would love? I wooed a woman once,"
10750,AUDLEY COURT,"But she was sharper than an eastern wind,"
10751,AUDLEY COURT,"And all my heart turn'd from her, as a thorn"
10752,AUDLEY COURT,"Turns from the sea: but let me live my life."""
10753,AUDLEY COURT,"He sang his song, and I replied with mine:"
10754,AUDLEY COURT,"I found it in a volume, all of songs,"
10755,AUDLEY COURT,"Knock'd down to me, when old Sir Robert's pride,"
10756,AUDLEY COURT,"His books--the more the pity, so I said--"
10757,AUDLEY COURT,Came to the hammer here in March--and this--
10758,AUDLEY COURT,"I set the words, and added names I knew."
10759,AUDLEY COURT,"""Sleep, Ellen Aubrey, sleep and dream of me:"
10760,AUDLEY COURT,"Sleep, Ellen, folded in thy sister's arm,"
10761,AUDLEY COURT,"And sleeping, haply dream her arm is mine."
10762,AUDLEY COURT,"""Sleep, Ellen, folded in Emilia's arm;"
10763,AUDLEY COURT,"Emilia, fairer than all else but thou,"
10764,AUDLEY COURT,For thou art fairer than all else that is.
10765,AUDLEY COURT,"""Sleep, breathing health and peace upon her breast:"
10766,AUDLEY COURT,"Sleep, breathing love and trust against her lip:"
10767,AUDLEY COURT,I go to-night: I come to-morrow morn.
10768,AUDLEY COURT,"""I go, but I return: I would I were"
10769,AUDLEY COURT,The pilot of the darkness and the dream.
10770,AUDLEY COURT,"Sleep, Ellen Aubrey, love, and dream of me."""
10771,AUDLEY COURT,"So sang we each to either, Francis Hale,"
10772,AUDLEY COURT,"The farmer's son who lived across the bay,"
10773,AUDLEY COURT,"My friend; and I, that having wherewithal,"
10774,AUDLEY COURT,And in the fallow leisure of my life
10775,AUDLEY COURT,"A rolling stone of here and everywhere, [6]"
10776,AUDLEY COURT,Did what I would; but ere the night we rose
10777,AUDLEY COURT,"And saunter'd home beneath a moon that, just"
10778,AUDLEY COURT,"In crescent, dimly rain'd about the leaf"
10779,AUDLEY COURT,"Twilights of airy silver, till we reach'd"
10780,AUDLEY COURT,The limit of the hills; and as we sank
10781,AUDLEY COURT,"From rock to rock upon the gloomy quay,"
10782,AUDLEY COURT,The town was hush'd beneath us: lower down
10783,AUDLEY COURT,The bay was oily-calm: the harbour buoy
10784,AUDLEY COURT,With one green sparkle ever and anon [7]
10785,AUDLEY COURT,"Dipt by itself, and we were glad at heart. [8]"

10822,WALKING TO THE MAIL,How fresh the meadows look
10823,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"Above the river, and, but a month ago,"
10824,WALKING TO THE MAIL,The whole hill-side was redder than a fox.
10825,WALKING TO THE MAIL,Is yon plantation where this byway joins
10826,WALKING TO THE MAIL,The turnpike? [1]
10827,WALKING TO THE MAIL,
10828,WALKING TO THE MAIL,'James'. Yes.

10831,WALKING TO THE MAIL,
10832,WALKING TO THE MAIL,'James'. The mail? At one o'clock.

10836,WALKING TO THE MAIL,James'.  A quarter to.

10839,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"No, not the County Member's with the vane:"
10840,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"Up higher with the yewtree by it, and half"

10846,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"'John'.  Oh, his. He was not broken?"

10851,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"From all men, and commercing with himself,"

10869,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"'Delicto'; but his house, for so they say,"

10881,WALKING TO THE MAIL,
10882,WALKING TO THE MAIL,'John'.  He left 'his' wife behind; for so I heard.
10883,WALKING TO THE MAIL,
10884,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"'James'. He left her, yes. I met my lady once:"
10885,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"A woman like a butt, and harsh as crabs."
10886,WALKING TO THE MAIL,
10887,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"'John'.  Oh, yet, but I remember, ten years back--"
10888,WALKING TO THE MAIL,'Tis now at least ten years--and then she was--
10889,WALKING TO THE MAIL,You could not light upon a sweeter thing:
10890,WALKING TO THE MAIL,A body slight and round and like a pear
10891,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"In growing, modest eyes, a hand a foot"
10892,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"Lessening in perfect cadence, and a skin"
10893,WALKING TO THE MAIL,As clean and white as privet when it flowers.

10896,WALKING TO THE MAIL,At first like dove and dove were cat and dog.
10897,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"She was the daughter of a cottager,"
10898,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"Out of her sphere. What betwixt shame and pride,"
10899,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"New things and old, himself and her, she sour'd"
10900,WALKING TO THE MAIL,To what she is: a nature never kind!
10901,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"Like men, like manners: like breeds like, they say."
10902,WALKING TO THE MAIL,Kind nature is the best: those manners next
10903,WALKING TO THE MAIL,That fit us like a nature second-hand;
10904,WALKING TO THE MAIL,Which are indeed the manners of the great.
10905,WALKING TO THE MAIL,
10906,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"'John'.  But I had heard it was this bill that past,"
10907,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"And fear of change at home, that drove him hence."
10908,WALKING TO THE MAIL,
10909,WALKING TO THE MAIL,'James'. That was the last drop in the cup of gall.
10910,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"I once was near him, when his bailiff brought"
10911,WALKING TO THE MAIL,A Chartist pike. You should have seen him wince
10912,WALKING TO THE MAIL,As from a venomous thing: he thought himself
10913,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"A mark for all, and shudder'd, lest a cry"
10914,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"Should break his sleep by night, and his nice eyes"
10915,WALKING TO THE MAIL,Should see the raw mechanic's bloody thumbs
10916,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"Sweat on his blazon'd chairs; but, sir, you know"
10917,WALKING TO THE MAIL,That these two parties still divide the world--
10918,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"Of those that want, and those that have: and still"
10919,WALKING TO THE MAIL,The same old sore breaks out from age to age
10920,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"With much the same result. Now I myself, [6]"
10921,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"A Tory to the quick, was as a boy"
10922,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"Destructive, when I had not what I would."
10923,WALKING TO THE MAIL,I was at school--a college in the South:
10924,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"There lived a flayflint near; we stole his fruit,"

10934,WALKING TO THE MAIL,"And but for daily loss of one she loved,"

11108,"OR, THE LAKE","A touch of something false, some self-conceit,"
11109,"OR, THE LAKE","Or over-smoothness: howsoe'er it was,"

11118,"OR, THE LAKE","Have or should have, but for a thought or two,"
11119,"OR, THE LAKE",That like a purple beech [7] among the greens
11120,"OR, THE LAKE",Looks out of place: 'tis from no want in her:
11121,"OR, THE LAKE","It is my shyness, or my self-distrust,"

11123,"OR, THE LAKE","Dissecting passion. Time will set me right."""
11124,"OR, THE LAKE",
11125,"OR, THE LAKE",So spoke I knowing not the things that were.

11128,"OR, THE LAKE","And for the good and increase of the world""."
11129,"OR, THE LAKE",And I and Edwin laugh'd; and now we paused
11130,"OR, THE LAKE",About the windings of the marge to hear
11131,"OR, THE LAKE",The soft wind blowing over meadowy holms
11132,"OR, THE LAKE","And alders, garden-isles [8]; and now we left"
11133,"OR, THE LAKE","The clerk behind us, I and he, and ran"
11134,"OR, THE LAKE","By ripply shallows of the lisping lake,"
11135,"OR, THE LAKE",Delighted with the freshness and the sound.
11136,"OR, THE LAKE","But, when the bracken rusted on their crags,"
11137,"OR, THE LAKE","My suit had wither'd, nipt to death by him"
11138,"OR, THE LAKE","That was a God, and is a lawyer's clerk,"
11139,"OR, THE LAKE",The rentroll Cupid of our rainy isles. [9]
11140,"OR, THE LAKE",
11141,"OR, THE LAKE","'Tis true, we met; one hour I had, no more:"
11142,"OR, THE LAKE","She sent a note, the seal an _Elle vous suit_, [10]"
11143,"OR, THE LAKE","The close ""Your Letty, only yours""; and this"
11144,"OR, THE LAKE",Thrice underscored. The friendly mist of morn
11145,"OR, THE LAKE","Clung to the lake. I boated over, ran"
11146,"OR, THE LAKE","My craft aground, and heard with beating heart"
11147,"OR, THE LAKE",The Sweet-Gale rustle round the shelving keel;
11148,"OR, THE LAKE","And out I stept, and up I crept: she moved,"
11149,"OR, THE LAKE","Like Proserpine in Enna, gathering flowers: [11]"
11150,"OR, THE LAKE","Then low and sweet I whistled thrice; and she,"
11151,"OR, THE LAKE","She turn'd, we closed, we kiss'd, swore faith, I breathed"
11152,"OR, THE LAKE",In some new planet: a silent cousin stole
11153,"OR, THE LAKE","Upon us and departed: ""Leave,"" she cried,"
11154,"OR, THE LAKE","""O leave me!"" ""Never, dearest, never: here"
11155,"OR, THE LAKE","I brave the worst:"" and while we stood like fools"
11156,"OR, THE LAKE","Embracing, all at once a score of pugs"
11157,"OR, THE LAKE","And poodles yell'd within, and out they came"
11158,"OR, THE LAKE","Trustees and Aunts and Uncles. ""What, with him!"
11159,"OR, THE LAKE","""Go"" (shrill'd the cottonspinning chorus) ""him!"""

11163,"OR, THE LAKE","They wedded her to sixty thousand pounds,"
11164,"OR, THE LAKE","To lands in Kent and messuages in York,"
11165,"OR, THE LAKE",And slight Sir Robert with his watery smile
11166,"OR, THE LAKE","And educated whisker. But for me,"
11167,"OR, THE LAKE",They set an ancient creditor to work:

11170,"OR, THE LAKE","To greet the sheriff, needless courtesy!"

11173,"OR, THE LAKE","I turn'd once more, close-button'd to the storm;"
11174,"OR, THE LAKE","So left the place, [13] left Edwin, nor have seen"

11178,"OR, THE LAKE","It may be, for her own dear sake but this,"

11263,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,whom there is an elaborate biography in Greek by Nicephorus printed with
11264,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"a Latin translation and notes in the 'Acta Sanctorum', tom. v., 24th"
11265,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"May, 298-401. It seems clear that whoever compiled the account"
11266,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,popularised by Hone had read both and amalgamated them. The main lines
11267,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"in the story of both saints are exactly the same. Both stood on columns,"
11268,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"both tortured themselves in the same ways, both wrought miracles, and"
11269,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,both died at their posts of penance. St. Simeon the Elder was born at
11270,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Sisan in Syria about A.D. 390, and was buried at Antioch in A.D. 459 or"
11271,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,460. The Simeon the Younger was born at Antioch A. D. 521 and died in
11272,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"A.D. 592. His life, which is of singular interest, is much more"
11273,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,elaborately related.
11274,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,
11275,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,This poem is not simply a dramatic study. It bears very directly on
11276,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Tennyson's philosophy of life. In these early poems he has given us four
11277,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"studies in the morbid anatomy of character: 'The Palace of Art', which"
11278,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,illustrates the abuse of aesthetic and intellectual enjoyment of self;
11279,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"'The Vision of Sin', which illustrates the effects of similar indulgence"
11280,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"in the grosser pleasures of the senses; 'The Two Voices', which"
11281,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"illustrates the mischief of despondent self-absorption, while the"
11282,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,present poem illustrates the equally pernicious indulgence in an
11283,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"opposite extreme, asceticism affected for the mere gratification of"
11284,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,personal vanity.
11285,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,
11286,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,
11287,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Altho' I be the basest of mankind,"
11288,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"From scalp to sole one slough and crust of sin,"
11289,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Unfit for earth, unfit for heaven, scarce meet"
11290,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"For troops of devils, mad with blasphemy,"
11291,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,I will not cease to grasp the hope I hold
11292,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Of saintdom, and to clamour, morn and sob,"
11293,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Battering the gates of heaven with storms of prayer,"
11294,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Have mercy, Lord, and take away my sin."
11295,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Let this avail, just, dreadful, mighty God,"
11296,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"This not be all in vain that thrice ten years,"
11297,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Thrice multiplied by superhuman pangs,"
11298,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"In hungers and in thirsts, fevers and cold,"
11299,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"In coughs, aches, stitches, ulcerous throes and cramps,"
11300,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"A sign betwixt the meadow and the cloud,"
11301,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Patient on this tall pillar I have borne
11302,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Rain, wind, frost, heat, hail, damp, and sleet, and snow;"
11303,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,And I had hoped that ere this period closed
11304,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Thou wouldst have caught me up into Thy rest,"
11305,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Denying not these weather-beaten limbs
11306,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"The meed of saints, the white robe and the palm."
11307,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"O take the meaning, Lord: I do not breathe,"
11308,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Not whisper, any murmur of complaint."
11309,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Pain heap'd ten-hundred-fold to this, were still"
11310,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Less burthen, by ten-hundred-fold, to bear,"
11311,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Than were those lead-like tons of sin, that crush'd"
11312,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"My spirit flat before thee. O Lord, Lord,"
11313,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Thou knowest I bore this better at the first,"
11314,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,For I was strong and hale of body then;
11315,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"And tho' my teeth, which now are dropt away,"
11316,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Would chatter with the cold, and all my beard"
11317,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Was tagg'd with icy fringes in the moon,"
11318,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,I drown'd the whoopings of the owl with sound
11319,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Of pious hymns and psalms, and sometimes saw"
11320,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"An angel stand and watch me, as I sang."
11321,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Now am I feeble grown; my end draws nigh;
11322,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"I hope my end draws nigh: half deaf I am,"
11323,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,So that I scarce can hear the people hum
11324,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"About the column's base, and almost blind,"
11325,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,And scarce can recognise the fields I know;
11326,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,And both my thighs are rotted with the dew;
11327,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Yet cease I not to clamour and to cry,"
11328,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"While my stiff spine can hold my weary head,"
11329,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Till all my limbs drop piecemeal from the stone,"
11330,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Have mercy, mercy: take away my sin."
11331,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"O Jesus, if thou wilt not save my soul,"
11332,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Who may be saved? who is it may be saved?
11333,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Who may be made a saint, if I fail here?"
11334,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Show me the man hath suffered more than I.
11335,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,For did not all thy martyrs die one death?
11336,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"For either they were stoned, or crucified,"
11337,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Or burn'd in fire, or boil'd in oil, or sawn"
11338,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,In twain beneath the ribs; but I die here
11339,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"To-day, and whole years long, a life of death."
11340,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Bear witness, if I could have found a way"
11341,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,(And heedfully I sifted all my thought)
11342,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,More slowly-painful to subdue this home
11343,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Of sin, my flesh, which I despise and hate,"
11344,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"I had not stinted practice, O my God."
11345,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"For not alone this pillar-punishment, [1]"
11346,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Not this alone I bore: but while I lived
11347,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"In the white convent down the valley there,"
11348,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,For many weeks about my loins I wore
11349,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"The rope that haled the buckets from the well,"
11350,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Twisted as tight as I could knot the noose;
11351,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"And spake not of it to a single soul,"
11352,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Until the ulcer, eating thro' my skin,"
11353,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Betray'd my secret penance, so that all"
11354,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,My brethren marvell'd greatly. More than this
11355,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"I bore, whereof, O God, thou knowest all.[2]"
11356,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Three winters, that my soul might grow to thee,"
11357,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,I lived up there on yonder mountain side.
11358,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"My right leg chain'd into the crag, I lay"
11359,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Pent in a roofless close of ragged stones;
11360,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Inswathed sometimes in wandering mist, and twice"
11361,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Black'd with thy branding thunder, and sometimes"
11362,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Sucking the damps for drink, and eating not,"
11363,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Except the spare chance-gift of those that came
11364,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"To touch my body and be heal'd, and live:"
11365,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"And they say then that I work'd miracles,"
11366,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Whereof my fame is loud amongst mankind,"
11367,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Cured lameness, palsies, cancers. Thou, O God,"
11368,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Knowest alone whether this was or no.
11369,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Have mercy, mercy; cover all my sin."
11370,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,
11371,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Then, that I might be more alone with thee, [3]"
11372,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Three years I lived upon a pillar, high"
11373,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Six cubits, and three years on one of twelve;"
11374,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,And twice three years I crouch'd on one that rose
11375,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Twenty by measure; last of all, I grew"
11376,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Twice ten long weary weary years to this,"
11377,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,That numbers forty cubits from the soil.
11378,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,I think that I have borne as much as this--
11379,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Or else I dream--and for so long a time,"
11380,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"If I may measure time by yon slow light,"
11381,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"And this high dial, which my sorrow crowns--"
11382,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"So much--even so. And yet I know not well,"
11383,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"For that the evil ones comes here, and say,"
11384,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"""Fall down, O Simeon: thou hast suffer'd long"
11385,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"For ages and for ages!"" then they prate"
11386,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Of penances I cannot have gone thro',"
11387,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Perplexing me with lies; and oft I fall,"
11388,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Maybe for months, in such blind lethargies,"
11389,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"That Heaven, and Earth, and Time are choked. But yet"
11390,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Bethink thee, Lord, while thou and all the saints"
11391,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Enjoy themselves in Heaven, and men on earth"
11392,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"House in the shade of comfortable roofs,"
11393,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Sit with their wives by fires, eat wholesome food,"
11394,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"And wear warm clothes, and even beasts have stalls,"
11395,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"I, 'tween the spring and downfall of the light,"
11396,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Bow down one thousand and two hundred times,"
11397,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"To Christ, the Virgin Mother, and the Saints;"
11398,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Or in the night, after a little sleep,"
11399,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,I wake: the chill stars sparkle; I am wet
11400,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"With drenching dews, or stiff with crackling frost."
11401,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,I wear an undress'd goatskin on my back;
11402,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,A grazing iron collar grinds my neck;
11403,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"And in my weak, lean arms I lift the cross,"
11404,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,And strive and wrestle with thee till I die:
11405,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"O mercy, mercy! wash away my sin."
11406,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"O Lord, thou knowest what a man I am;"
11407,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"A sinful man, conceived and born in sin:"
11408,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,'Tis their own doing; this is none of mine;
11409,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Lay it not to me. Am I to blame for this,"
11410,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,That here come those that worship me? Ha! ha!
11411,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,They think that I am somewhat. What am I?
11412,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"The silly people take me for a saint,"
11413,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,And bring me offerings of fruit and flowers:
11414,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"And I, in truth (thou wilt bear witness here)"
11415,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Have all in all endured as much, and more"
11416,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Than many just and holy men, whose names"
11417,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Are register'd and calendar'd for saints.
11418,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Good people, you do ill to kneel to me."
11419,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,What is it I can have done to merit this?
11420,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,I am a sinner viler than you all.
11421,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"It may be I have wrought some miracles, [4]"
11422,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,And cured some halt and maim'd; but what of that?
11423,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"It may be, no one, even among the saints,"
11424,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,May match his pains with mine; but what of that?
11425,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Yet do not rise: for you may look on me,"
11426,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,And in your looking you may kneel to God.
11427,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Speak! is there any of you halt or maim'd?
11428,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,I think you know I have some power with Heaven
11429,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,From my long penance: let him speak his wish.
11430,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Yes, I can heal. Power goes forth from me."
11431,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"They say that they are heal'd. Ah, hark! they shout"
11432,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"""St. Simeon Stylites"". Why, if so,"
11433,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"God reaps a harvest in me. O my soul,"
11434,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"God reaps a harvest in thee. If this be,"
11435,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Can I work miracles and not be saved?
11436,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,This is not told of any. They were saints.
11437,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,It cannot be but that I shall be saved;
11438,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Yea, crown'd a saint. They shout, ""Behold a saint!"""
11439,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,And lower voices saint me from above.
11440,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Courage, St. Simeon! This dull chrysalis"
11441,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Cracks into shining wings, and hope ere death"
11442,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Spreads more and more and more, that God hath now"
11443,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Sponged and made blank of crimeful record all
11444,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"My mortal archives. O my sons, my sons,"
11445,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"I, Simeon of the pillar, by surname Stylites, among men;"
11446,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"I, Simeon, The watcher on the column till the end;"
11447,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"I, Simeon, whose brain the sunshine bakes;"
11448,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"I, whose bald brows in silent hours become"
11449,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Unnaturally hoar with rime, do now"
11450,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,From my high nest of penance here proclaim
11451,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,That Pontius and Iscariot by my side
11452,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Show'd like fair seraphs. On the coals I lay,"
11453,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,A vessel full of sin: all hell beneath
11454,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Made me boil over. Devils pluck'd my sleeve; [5]
11455,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Abaddon and Asmodeus caught at me.
11456,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,I smote them with the cross; they swarm'd again.
11457,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,In bed like monstrous apes they crush'd my chest:
11458,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,They flapp'd my light out as I read: I saw
11459,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Their faces grow between me and my book:
11460,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,With colt-like whinny and with hoggish whine
11461,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"They burst my prayer. Yet this way was left,"
11462,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,And by this way I'scaped them. Mortify
11463,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Your flesh, like me, with scourges and with thorns;"
11464,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Smite, shrink not, spare not. If it may be, fast"
11465,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Whole Lents, and pray. I hardly, with slow steps,"
11466,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"With slow, faint steps, and much exceeding pain,"
11467,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Have scrambled past those pits of fire, that still"
11468,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Sing in mine ears. But yield not me the praise:
11469,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"God only thro' his bounty hath thought fit,"
11470,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Among the powers and princes of this world,"
11471,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"To make me an example to mankind,"
11472,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Which few can reach to. Yet I do not say
11473,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"But that a time may come--yea, even now,"
11474,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Now, now, his footsteps smite the threshold stairs"
11475,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Of life--I say, that time is at the doors"
11476,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,When you may worship me without reproach;
11477,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"For I will leave my relics in your land,"
11478,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"And you may carve a shrine about my dust,"
11479,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"And burn a fragrant lamp before my bones,"
11480,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,When I am gather'd to the glorious saints.
11481,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"While I spake then, a sting of shrewdest pain"
11482,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Ran shrivelling thro' me, and a cloudlike change,"
11483,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"In passing, with a grosser film made thick"
11484,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"These heavy, horny eyes. The end! the end!"
11485,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Surely the end! What's here? a shape, a shade,"
11486,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,A flash of light. Is that the angel there
11487,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"That holds a crown? Come, blessed brother, come,"
11488,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,I know thy glittering face. I waited long;
11489,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,My brows are ready. What! deny it now?
11490,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Nay, draw, draw, draw nigh. So I clutch it. Christ!"
11491,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,'Tis gone: 'tis here again; the crown! the crown! [6]
11492,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"So now 'tis fitted on and grows to me,"
11493,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"And from it melt the dews of Paradise,"
11494,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Sweet! sweet! spikenard, and balm, and frankincense."
11495,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Ah! let me not be fool'd, sweet saints: I trust"
11496,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"That I am whole, and clean, and meet for Heaven."
11497,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Speak, if there be a priest, a man of God,"
11498,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Among you there, and let him presently"
11499,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"Approach, and lean a ladder on the shaft,"
11500,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"And climbing up into my airy home,"
11501,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,Deliver me the blessed sacrament;
11502,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"For by the warning of the Holy Ghost,"
11503,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"I prophesy that I shall die to-night,"
11504,ST. SIMEON STYLITES,"A quarter before twelve. [7] But thou, O Lord,"

11562,THE TALKING OAK,"First published in 1842, and republished in all subsequent editions with"
11563,THE TALKING OAK,"only two slight alterations: in line 113 a mere variant in spelling, and"
11564,THE TALKING OAK,"in line 185, where in place of the present reading the editions between"
11565,THE TALKING OAK,"1842 and 1848 read, ""For, ah! the Dryad-days were brief""."
11566,THE TALKING OAK,
11567,THE TALKING OAK,Tennyson told Mr. Aubrey de Vere that the poem was an experiment meant
11568,THE TALKING OAK,to test the degree in which it is in the power of poetry to humanise
11569,THE TALKING OAK,external nature. Tennyson might have remembered that Ovid had made the
11570,THE TALKING OAK,"same experiment nearly two thousand years ago, while Goethe had"
11571,THE TALKING OAK,immediately anticipated him in his charming 'Der Junggesett und der
11572,THE TALKING OAK,Mühlbach'. There was certainly no novelty in such an attempt. The poem
11573,THE TALKING OAK,"is in parts charmingly written, but the oak is certainly ""garrulously"
11574,THE TALKING OAK,"given,"" and comes perilously near to tediousness."
11575,THE TALKING OAK,
11576,THE TALKING OAK,
11577,THE TALKING OAK,Once more the gate behind me falls;
11578,THE TALKING OAK,Once more before my face
11579,THE TALKING OAK,"I see the moulder'd Abbey-walls,"
11580,THE TALKING OAK,That stand within the chace.
11581,THE TALKING OAK,
11582,THE TALKING OAK,"Beyond the lodge the city lies,"
11583,THE TALKING OAK,Beneath its drift of smoke;
11584,THE TALKING OAK,And ah! with what delighted eyes
11585,THE TALKING OAK,I turn to yonder oak.
11586,THE TALKING OAK,
11587,THE TALKING OAK,"For when my passion first began,"
11588,THE TALKING OAK,"Ere that, which in me burn'd,"
11589,THE TALKING OAK,"The love, that makes me thrice a man,"
11590,THE TALKING OAK,Could hope itself return'd;
11591,THE TALKING OAK,
11592,THE TALKING OAK,To yonder oak within the field
11593,THE TALKING OAK,"I spoke without restraint,"
11594,THE TALKING OAK,And with a larger faith appeal'd
11595,THE TALKING OAK,Than Papist unto Saint.
11596,THE TALKING OAK,
11597,THE TALKING OAK,"For oft I talk'd with him apart,"
11598,THE TALKING OAK,"And told him of my choice,"
11599,THE TALKING OAK,"Until he plagiarised a heart,"
11600,THE TALKING OAK,And answer'd with a voice.
11601,THE TALKING OAK,
11602,THE TALKING OAK,"Tho' what he whisper'd, under Heaven"
11603,THE TALKING OAK,None else could understand;
11604,THE TALKING OAK,"I found him garrulously given,"
11605,THE TALKING OAK,A babbler in the land.
11606,THE TALKING OAK,
11607,THE TALKING OAK,But since I heard him make reply
11608,THE TALKING OAK,Is many a weary hour;
11609,THE TALKING OAK,"'Twere well to question him, and try"
11610,THE TALKING OAK,If yet he keeps the power.
11611,THE TALKING OAK,
11612,THE TALKING OAK,"Hail, hidden to the knees in fern,"
11613,THE TALKING OAK,"Broad Oak of Sumner-chace,"
11614,THE TALKING OAK,Whose topmost branches can discern
11615,THE TALKING OAK,The roofs of Sumner-place!
11616,THE TALKING OAK,
11617,THE TALKING OAK,"Say thou, whereon I carved her name,"
11618,THE TALKING OAK,"If ever maid or spouse,"
11619,THE TALKING OAK,"As fair as my Olivia, came"
11620,THE TALKING OAK,To rest beneath thy boughs.--
11621,THE TALKING OAK,
11622,THE TALKING OAK,"""O Walter, I have shelter'd here"
11623,THE TALKING OAK,Whatever maiden grace
11624,THE TALKING OAK,"The good old Summers, year by year,"
11625,THE TALKING OAK,Made ripe in Sumner-chace:
11626,THE TALKING OAK,
11627,THE TALKING OAK,"""Old Summers, when the monk was fat,"
11628,THE TALKING OAK,"And, issuing shorn and sleek,"
11629,THE TALKING OAK,"Would twist his girdle tight, and pat"
11630,THE TALKING OAK,The girls upon the cheek.
11631,THE TALKING OAK,
11632,THE TALKING OAK,"""Ere yet, in scorn of Peter's-pence,"
11633,THE TALKING OAK,"And number'd bead, and shrift,"
11634,THE TALKING OAK,"Bluff Harry broke into the spence, [1]"
11635,THE TALKING OAK,And turn'd the cowls adrift:
11636,THE TALKING OAK,
11637,THE TALKING OAK,"""And I have seen some score of those"
11638,THE TALKING OAK,"Fresh faces, that would thrive"
11639,THE TALKING OAK,When his man-minded offset rose
11640,THE TALKING OAK,To chase the deer at five;
11641,THE TALKING OAK,
11642,THE TALKING OAK,"""And all that from the town would stroll,"
11643,THE TALKING OAK,Till that wild wind made work
11644,THE TALKING OAK,In which the gloomy brewer's soul
11645,THE TALKING OAK,"Went by me, like a stork:"
11646,THE TALKING OAK,
11647,THE TALKING OAK,"""The slight she-slips of loyal blood,"
11648,THE TALKING OAK,"And others, passing praise,"
11649,THE TALKING OAK,"Strait-laced, but all too full in bud"
11650,THE TALKING OAK,For puritanic stays: [2]
11651,THE TALKING OAK,
11652,THE TALKING OAK,"""And I have shadow'd many a group"
11653,THE TALKING OAK,"Of beauties, that were born"
11654,THE TALKING OAK,"In teacup-times of hood and hoop,"
11655,THE TALKING OAK,Or while the patch was worn;
11656,THE TALKING OAK,
11657,THE TALKING OAK,"""And, leg and arm with love-knots gay,"
11658,THE TALKING OAK,About me leap'd and laugh'd
11659,THE TALKING OAK,"The Modish Cupid of the day,"
11660,THE TALKING OAK,And shrill'd his tinsel shaft.
11661,THE TALKING OAK,
11662,THE TALKING OAK,"""I swear (and else may insects prick"
11663,THE TALKING OAK,Each leaf into a gall)
11664,THE TALKING OAK,"This girl, for whom your heart is sick,"
11665,THE TALKING OAK,Is three times worth them all;
11666,THE TALKING OAK,
11667,THE TALKING OAK,"""For those and theirs, by Nature's law,"
11668,THE TALKING OAK,Have faded long ago;
11669,THE TALKING OAK,But in these latter springs I saw
11670,THE TALKING OAK,"Your own Olivia blow,"
11671,THE TALKING OAK,
11672,THE TALKING OAK,"""From when she gamboll'd on the greens,"
11673,THE TALKING OAK,"A baby-germ, to when"
11674,THE TALKING OAK,The maiden blossoms of her teens
11675,THE TALKING OAK,Could number five from ten.
11676,THE TALKING OAK,
11677,THE TALKING OAK,"""I swear, by leaf, and wind, and rain"
11678,THE TALKING OAK,"(And hear me with thine ears),"
11679,THE TALKING OAK,"That, tho' I circle in the grain"
11680,THE TALKING OAK,Five hundred rings of years--
11681,THE TALKING OAK,
11682,THE TALKING OAK,"""Yet, since I first could cast a shade,"
11683,THE TALKING OAK,Did never creature pass
11684,THE TALKING OAK,"So slightly, musically made,"
11685,THE TALKING OAK,So light upon the grass:
11686,THE TALKING OAK,
11687,THE TALKING OAK,"""For as to fairies, that will flit"
11688,THE TALKING OAK,"To make the greensward fresh,"
11689,THE TALKING OAK,"I hold them exquisitely knit,"
11690,THE TALKING OAK,"But far too spare of flesh."""
11691,THE TALKING OAK,
11692,THE TALKING OAK,"Oh, hide thy knotted knees in fern,"
11693,THE TALKING OAK,And overlook the chace;
11694,THE TALKING OAK,And from thy topmost branch discern
11695,THE TALKING OAK,The roofs of Sumner-place.
11696,THE TALKING OAK,
11697,THE TALKING OAK,"But thou, whereon I carved her name,"
11698,THE TALKING OAK,"That oft hast heard my vows,"
11699,THE TALKING OAK,Declare when last Olivia came
11700,THE TALKING OAK,To sport beneath thy boughs.
11701,THE TALKING OAK,
11702,THE TALKING OAK,"""O yesterday, you know, the fair"
11703,THE TALKING OAK,Was holden at the town;
11704,THE TALKING OAK,"Her father left his good arm-chair,"
11705,THE TALKING OAK,And rode his hunter down.
11706,THE TALKING OAK,
11707,THE TALKING OAK,"""And with him Albert came on his."
11708,THE TALKING OAK,I look'd at him with joy:
11709,THE TALKING OAK,"As cowslip unto oxlip is,"
11710,THE TALKING OAK,So seems she to the boy.
11711,THE TALKING OAK,
11712,THE TALKING OAK,"""An hour had past--and, sitting straight"
11713,THE TALKING OAK,"Within the low-wheel'd chaise,"
11714,THE TALKING OAK,Her mother trundled to the gate
11715,THE TALKING OAK,Behind the dappled grays.
11716,THE TALKING OAK,
11717,THE TALKING OAK,"""But, as for her, she stay'd [3] at home,"
11718,THE TALKING OAK,"And on the roof she went,"
11719,THE TALKING OAK,"And down the way you use to come,"
11720,THE TALKING OAK,She look'd with discontent.
11721,THE TALKING OAK,
11722,THE TALKING OAK,"""She left the novel half-uncut"
11723,THE TALKING OAK,Upon the rosewood shelf;
11724,THE TALKING OAK,She left the new piano shut:
11725,THE TALKING OAK,She could not please herself.
11726,THE TALKING OAK,
11727,THE TALKING OAK,"""Then ran she, gamesome as the colt,"
11728,THE TALKING OAK,And livelier than a lark
11729,THE TALKING OAK,She sent her voice thro' all the holt
11730,THE TALKING OAK,"Before her, and the park."
11731,THE TALKING OAK,
11732,THE TALKING OAK,"""A light wind chased her on the wing,"
11733,THE TALKING OAK,"And in the chase grew wild,"
11734,THE TALKING OAK,As close as might be would he cling
11735,THE TALKING OAK,About the darling child:
11736,THE TALKING OAK,
11737,THE TALKING OAK,"""But light as any wind that blows"
11738,THE TALKING OAK,"So fleetly did she stir,"
11739,THE TALKING OAK,"The flower she touch'd on dipt and rose,"
11740,THE TALKING OAK,And turn'd to look at her.
11741,THE TALKING OAK,
11742,THE TALKING OAK,"""And here she came, and round me play'd,"
11743,THE TALKING OAK,And sang to me the whole
11744,THE TALKING OAK,Of those three stanzas that you made
11745,THE TALKING OAK,About my 'giant bole';
11746,THE TALKING OAK,
11747,THE TALKING OAK,"""And in a fit of frolic mirth"
11748,THE TALKING OAK,She strove to span my waist:
11749,THE TALKING OAK,"Alas, I was so broad of girth,"
11750,THE TALKING OAK,I could not be embraced.
11751,THE TALKING OAK,
11752,THE TALKING OAK,"""I wish'd myself the fair young beech"
11753,THE TALKING OAK,"That here beside me stands,"
11754,THE TALKING OAK,"That round me, clasping each in each,"
11755,THE TALKING OAK,She might have lock'd her hands.
11756,THE TALKING OAK,
11757,THE TALKING OAK,"""Yet seem'd the pressure thrice as sweet"
11758,THE TALKING OAK,"As woodbine's fragile hold,"
11759,THE TALKING OAK,Or when I feel about my feet
11760,THE TALKING OAK,"The berried briony fold."""
11761,THE TALKING OAK,
11762,THE TALKING OAK,"O muffle round thy knees with fern,"
11763,THE TALKING OAK,And shadow Sumner-chace!
11764,THE TALKING OAK,Long may thy topmost branch discern
11765,THE TALKING OAK,The roofs of Sumner-place!
11766,THE TALKING OAK,
11767,THE TALKING OAK,"But tell me, did she read the name"
11768,THE TALKING OAK,I carved with many vows
11769,THE TALKING OAK,When last with throbbing heart I came
11770,THE TALKING OAK,To rest beneath thy boughs?
11771,THE TALKING OAK,
11772,THE TALKING OAK,"""O yes, she wander'd round and round"
11773,THE TALKING OAK,"These knotted knees of mine,"
11774,THE TALKING OAK,"And found, and kiss'd the name she found,"
11775,THE TALKING OAK,And sweetly murmur'd thine.
11776,THE TALKING OAK,
11777,THE TALKING OAK,"""A teardrop trembled from its source,"
11778,THE TALKING OAK,And down my surface crept.
11779,THE TALKING OAK,"My sense of touch is something coarse,"
11780,THE TALKING OAK,But I believe she wept.
11781,THE TALKING OAK,
11782,THE TALKING OAK,"""Then flush'd her cheek with rosy light,"
11783,THE TALKING OAK,She glanced across the plain;
11784,THE TALKING OAK,But not a creature was in sight:
11785,THE TALKING OAK,She kiss'd me once again.
11786,THE TALKING OAK,
11787,THE TALKING OAK,"""Her kisses were so close and kind,"
11788,THE TALKING OAK,"That, trust me on my word,"
11789,THE TALKING OAK,"Hard wood I am, and wrinkled rind,"
11790,THE TALKING OAK,But yet my sap was stirr'd:
11791,THE TALKING OAK,
11792,THE TALKING OAK,"""And even into my inmost ring"
11793,THE TALKING OAK,A pleasure I discern'd
11794,THE TALKING OAK,"Like those blind motions of the Spring,"
11795,THE TALKING OAK,That show the year is turn'd.
11796,THE TALKING OAK,
11797,THE TALKING OAK,"""Thrice-happy he that may caress"
11798,THE TALKING OAK,The ringlet's waving balm
11799,THE TALKING OAK,The cushions of whose touch may press
11800,THE TALKING OAK,The maiden's tender palm.
11801,THE TALKING OAK,
11802,THE TALKING OAK,"""I, rooted here among the groves,"
11803,THE TALKING OAK,But languidly adjust
11804,THE TALKING OAK,My vapid vegetable loves [4]
11805,THE TALKING OAK,With anthers and with dust:
11806,THE TALKING OAK,
11807,THE TALKING OAK,"""For, ah! my friend, the days were brief [5]"
11808,THE TALKING OAK,"Whereof the poets talk,"
11809,THE TALKING OAK,"When that, which breathes within the leaf,"
11810,THE TALKING OAK,Could slip its bark and walk.
11811,THE TALKING OAK,
11812,THE TALKING OAK,"""But could I, as in times foregone,"
11813,THE TALKING OAK,"From spray, and branch, and stem,"
11814,THE TALKING OAK,Have suck'd and gather'd into one
11815,THE TALKING OAK,"The life that spreads in them,"
11816,THE TALKING OAK,
11817,THE TALKING OAK,"""She had not found me so remiss;"
11818,THE TALKING OAK,"But lightly issuing thro',"
11819,THE TALKING OAK,I would have paid her kiss for kiss
11820,THE TALKING OAK,"With usury thereto."""
11821,THE TALKING OAK,
11822,THE TALKING OAK,"O flourish high, with leafy towers,"
11823,THE TALKING OAK,"And overlook the lea,"
11824,THE TALKING OAK,"Pursue thy loves among the bowers,"
11825,THE TALKING OAK,But leave thou mine to me.
11826,THE TALKING OAK,
11827,THE TALKING OAK,"O flourish, hidden deep in fern,"
11828,THE TALKING OAK,"Old oak, I love thee well;"
11829,THE TALKING OAK,A thousand thanks for what I learn
11830,THE TALKING OAK,And what remains to tell.
11831,THE TALKING OAK,
11832,THE TALKING OAK,"""'Tis little more: the day was warm;"
11833,THE TALKING OAK,"At last, tired out with play,"
11834,THE TALKING OAK,"She sank her head upon her arm,"
11835,THE TALKING OAK,And at my feet she lay.
11836,THE TALKING OAK,
11837,THE TALKING OAK,"""Her eyelids dropp'd their silken eaves."
11838,THE TALKING OAK,I breathed upon her eyes
11839,THE TALKING OAK,Thro' all the summer of my leaves
11840,THE TALKING OAK,A welcome mix'd with sighs.
11841,THE TALKING OAK,
11842,THE TALKING OAK,"""I took the swarming sound of life--"
11843,THE TALKING OAK,The music from the town--
11844,THE TALKING OAK,The murmurs of the drum and fife
11845,THE TALKING OAK,And lull'd them in my own.
11846,THE TALKING OAK,
11847,THE TALKING OAK,"""Sometimes I let a sunbeam slip,"
11848,THE TALKING OAK,To light her shaded eye;
11849,THE TALKING OAK,A second flutter'd round her lip
11850,THE TALKING OAK,Like a golden butterfly;
11851,THE TALKING OAK,
11852,THE TALKING OAK,"""A third would glimmer on her neck"
11853,THE TALKING OAK,To make the necklace shine;
11854,THE TALKING OAK,"Another slid, a sunny fleck,"
11855,THE TALKING OAK,From head to ancle fine.
11856,THE TALKING OAK,
11857,THE TALKING OAK,"""Then close and dark my arms I spread,"
11858,THE TALKING OAK,And shadow'd all her rest--
11859,THE TALKING OAK,"Dropt dews upon her golden head,"
11860,THE TALKING OAK,An acorn in her breast.
11861,THE TALKING OAK,
11862,THE TALKING OAK,"""But in a pet she started up,"
11863,THE TALKING OAK,"And pluck'd it out, and drew"
11864,THE TALKING OAK,"My little oakling from the cup,"
11865,THE TALKING OAK,And flung him in the dew.
11866,THE TALKING OAK,
11867,THE TALKING OAK,"""And yet it was a graceful gift--"
11868,THE TALKING OAK,I felt a pang within
11869,THE TALKING OAK,As when I see the woodman lift
11870,THE TALKING OAK,His axe to slay my kin.
11871,THE TALKING OAK,
11872,THE TALKING OAK,"""I shook him down because he was"
11873,THE TALKING OAK,The finest on the tree.
11874,THE TALKING OAK,He lies beside thee on the grass.
11875,THE TALKING OAK,O kiss him once for me.
11876,THE TALKING OAK,
11877,THE TALKING OAK,"""O kiss him twice and thrice for me,"
11878,THE TALKING OAK,"That have no lips to kiss,"
11879,THE TALKING OAK,For never yet was oak on lea
11880,THE TALKING OAK,"Shall grow so fair as this."""
11881,THE TALKING OAK,
11882,THE TALKING OAK,"Step deeper yet in herb and fern,"
11883,THE TALKING OAK,"Look further thro' the chace,"
11884,THE TALKING OAK,Spread upward till thy boughs discern
11885,THE TALKING OAK,The front of Sumner-place.
11886,THE TALKING OAK,
11887,THE TALKING OAK,"This fruit of thine by Love is blest,"
11888,THE TALKING OAK,That but a moment lay
11889,THE TALKING OAK,Where fairer fruit of Love may rest
11890,THE TALKING OAK,Some happy future day.
11891,THE TALKING OAK,
11892,THE TALKING OAK,"I kiss it twice, I kiss it thrice,"
11893,THE TALKING OAK,The warmth it thence shall win
11894,THE TALKING OAK,To riper life may magnetise
11895,THE TALKING OAK,The baby-oak within.
11896,THE TALKING OAK,
11897,THE TALKING OAK,"But thou, while kingdoms overset,"
11898,THE TALKING OAK,"Or lapse from hand to hand,"
11899,THE TALKING OAK,"Thy leaf shall never fail, nor yet"
11900,THE TALKING OAK,Thine acorn in the land.
11901,THE TALKING OAK,
11902,THE TALKING OAK,"May never saw dismember thee,"
11903,THE TALKING OAK,"Nor wielded axe disjoint,"
11904,THE TALKING OAK,That art the fairest-spoken tree
11905,THE TALKING OAK,From here to Lizard-point.
11906,THE TALKING OAK,
11907,THE TALKING OAK,O rock upon thy towery top
11908,THE TALKING OAK,All throats that gurgle sweet!
11909,THE TALKING OAK,All starry culmination drop
11910,THE TALKING OAK,Balm-dews to bathe thy feet!
11911,THE TALKING OAK,
11912,THE TALKING OAK,All grass of silky feather grow--
11913,THE TALKING OAK,And while he sinks or swells
11914,THE TALKING OAK,The full south-breeze around thee blow
11915,THE TALKING OAK,The sound of minster bells.
11916,THE TALKING OAK,
11917,THE TALKING OAK,"The fat earth feed thy branchy root,"
11918,THE TALKING OAK,That under deeply strikes!
11919,THE TALKING OAK,The northern morning o'er thee shoot
11920,THE TALKING OAK,"High up, in silver spikes!"
11921,THE TALKING OAK,
11922,THE TALKING OAK,"Nor ever lightning char thy grain,"
11923,THE TALKING OAK,"But, rolling as in sleep,"
11924,THE TALKING OAK,"Low thunders bring the mellow rain,"
11925,THE TALKING OAK,That makes thee broad and deep!
11926,THE TALKING OAK,
11927,THE TALKING OAK,"And hear me swear a solemn oath,"
11928,THE TALKING OAK,That only by thy side

12006,LOVE AND DUTY,"Art more thro' Love, and greater than thy years."

12023,LOVE AND DUTY,"Then not to dare to see! when thy low voice,"
12024,LOVE AND DUTY,"Faltering, would break its syllables, to keep"

12041,LOVE AND DUTY,"Could Love part thus? was it not well to speak,"
12042,LOVE AND DUTY,To have spoken once? It could not but be well.
12043,LOVE AND DUTY,"The slow sweet hours that bring us all things good, [3]"
12044,LOVE AND DUTY,"The slow sad hours that bring us all things ill,"
12045,LOVE AND DUTY,"And all good things from evil, brought the night"
12046,LOVE AND DUTY,"In which we sat together and alone,"
12047,LOVE AND DUTY,"And to the want, that hollow'd all the heart,"
12048,LOVE AND DUTY,"Gave utterance by the yearning of an eye,"
12049,LOVE AND DUTY,That burn'd upon its object thro' such tears
12050,LOVE AND DUTY,As flow but once a life. The trance gave way
12051,LOVE AND DUTY,"To those caresses, when a hundred times"
12052,LOVE AND DUTY,"In that last kiss, which never was the last,"
12053,LOVE AND DUTY,"Farewell, like endless welcome, lived and died."
12054,LOVE AND DUTY,"Then follow'd counsel, comfort and the words"
12055,LOVE AND DUTY,That make a man feel strong in speaking truth;
12056,LOVE AND DUTY,"Till now the dark was worn, and overhead"
12057,LOVE AND DUTY,The lights of sunset and of sunrise mix'd
12058,LOVE AND DUTY,"In that brief night; the summer night, that paused"
12059,LOVE AND DUTY,Among her stars to hear us; stars that hung
12060,LOVE AND DUTY,Love-charm'd to listen: all the wheels of Time
12061,LOVE AND DUTY,"Spun round in station, but the end had come."
12062,LOVE AND DUTY,"O then like those, who clench [4] their nerves to rush"
12063,LOVE AND DUTY,"Upon their dissolution, we two rose,"
12064,LOVE AND DUTY,There-closing like an individual life--
12065,LOVE AND DUTY,"In one blind cry of passion and of pain,"
12066,LOVE AND DUTY,"Like bitter accusation ev'n to death,"
12067,LOVE AND DUTY,"Caught up the whole of love and utter'd it,"
12068,LOVE AND DUTY,And bade adieu for ever. Live--yet live--
12069,LOVE AND DUTY,"Shall sharpest pathos blight us, knowing all"
12070,LOVE AND DUTY,Life needs for life is possible to will--
12071,LOVE AND DUTY,Live happy; tend thy flowers; be tended by
12072,LOVE AND DUTY,My blessing! Should my Shadow cross thy thoughts
12073,LOVE AND DUTY,"Too sadly for their peace, remand it thou"
12074,LOVE AND DUTY,"For calmer hours to Memory's darkest hold, [5]"
12075,LOVE AND DUTY,If not to be forgotten--not at once--
12076,LOVE AND DUTY,"Not all forgotten. Should it cross thy dreams,"
12077,LOVE AND DUTY,"O might it come like one that looks content,"
12078,LOVE AND DUTY,"With quiet eyes unfaithful to the truth,"
12079,LOVE AND DUTY,"And point thee forward to a distant light,"
12080,LOVE AND DUTY,Or seem to lift a burthen from thy heart

12135,THE GOLDEN YEAR,
12136,THE GOLDEN YEAR,This poem was first published in the fourth edition of the poems 1846.
12137,THE GOLDEN YEAR,No alterations were made in it after 1851. The poem had a message for
12138,THE GOLDEN YEAR,the time at which it was written. The country was in a very troubled
12139,THE GOLDEN YEAR,state. The contest between the Protectionists and Free-traders was at
12140,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"its acutest stage. The Maynooth endowment and the ""godless colleges"" had"
12141,THE GOLDEN YEAR,brought into prominence questions of the gravest moment in religion and
12142,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"education, while the Corn Bill and the Coercion Bill had inflamed the"
12143,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"passions of party politicians almost to madness. Tennyson, his son tells"
12144,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"us, entered heartily into these questions, believing that the remedies"
12145,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"for these distempers lay in the spread of education, a more catholic"
12146,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"spirit in the press, a partial adoption of Free Trade principles, and"
12147,THE GOLDEN YEAR,union as far as possible among the different sections of Christianity.
12148,THE GOLDEN YEAR,
12149,THE GOLDEN YEAR,
12150,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Well, you shall have that song which Leonard wrote:"
12151,THE GOLDEN YEAR,It was last summer on a tour in Wales:
12152,THE GOLDEN YEAR,Old James was with me: we that day had been
12153,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Up Snowdon; and I wish'd for Leonard there,"
12154,THE GOLDEN YEAR,And found him in Llanberis: [1] then we crost
12155,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Between the lakes, and clamber'd half-way up"
12156,THE GOLDEN YEAR,The counterside; and that same song of his
12157,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"He told me; for I banter'd him, and swore"
12158,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"They said he lived shut up within himself,"
12159,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"A tongue-tied Poet in the feverous days,"
12160,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"That, setting the _how much_ before the _how_,"
12161,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Cry, like the daughters of the horseleech, ""Give, [2]"
12162,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Cram us with all,"" but count not me the herd!"
12163,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"To which ""They call me what they will,"" he said:"
12164,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"""But I was born too late: the fair new forms,"
12165,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"That float about the threshold of an age,"
12166,THE GOLDEN YEAR,Like truths of Science waiting to be caught--
12167,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Catch me who can, and make the catcher crown'd--"
12168,THE GOLDEN YEAR,Are taken by the forelock. Let it be.
12169,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"But if you care indeed to listen, hear"
12170,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"These measured words, my work of yestermorn."
12171,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"""We sleep and wake and sleep, but all things move;"
12172,THE GOLDEN YEAR,The Sun flies forward to his brother Sun;
12173,THE GOLDEN YEAR,The dark Earth follows wheel'd in her ellipse;
12174,THE GOLDEN YEAR,And human things returning on themselves
12175,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Move onward, leading up the golden year."
12176,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"""Ah, tho' the times, when some new thought can bud,"
12177,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Are but as poets' seasons when they flower,"
12178,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Yet seas, that daily gain upon the shore, [3]"
12179,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Have ebb and flow conditioning their march,"
12180,THE GOLDEN YEAR,And slow and sure comes up the golden year.
12181,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"""When wealth no more shall rest in mounded heaps,"
12182,THE GOLDEN YEAR,But smit with freer light shall slowly melt
12183,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"In many streams to fatten lower lands,"
12184,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"And light shall spread, and man be liker man"
12185,THE GOLDEN YEAR,Thro' all the season of the golden year.
12186,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"""Shall eagles not be eagles? wrens be wrens?"
12187,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"If all the world were falcons, what of that?"
12188,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"The wonder of the eagle were the less,"
12189,THE GOLDEN YEAR,But he not less the eagle. Happy days
12190,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Roll onward, leading up the golden year."
12191,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"""Fly happy happy sails and bear the Press;"
12192,THE GOLDEN YEAR,Fly happy with the mission of the Cross;
12193,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Knit land to land, and blowing havenward"
12194,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"With silks, and fruits, and spices, clear of toll,"
12195,THE GOLDEN YEAR,Enrich the markets of the golden year.
12196,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"""But we grow old! Ah! when shall all men's good"
12197,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Be each man's rule, and universal Peace"
12198,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Lie like a shaft of light across the land,"
12199,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"And like a lane of beams athwart the sea,"
12200,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Thro' all the circle of the golden year?"""
12201,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Thus far he flow'd, and ended; whereupon"
12202,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"""Ah, folly!"" in mimic cadence answer'd James--"
12203,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"""Ah, folly! for it lies so far away."
12204,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Not in our time, nor in our children's time,"
12205,THE GOLDEN YEAR,'Tis like the second world to us that live;
12206,THE GOLDEN YEAR,'Twere all as one to fix our hopes on Heaven
12207,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"As on this vision of the golden year."""
12208,THE GOLDEN YEAR,With that he struck his staff against the rocks
12209,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"And broke it,--James,--you know him,--old, but full"
12210,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Of force and choler, and firm upon his feet,"
12211,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"And like an oaken stock in winter woods,"
12212,THE GOLDEN YEAR,O'erflourished with the hoary clematis:
12213,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Then added, all in heat: ""What stuff is this!"
12214,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Old writers push'd the happy season back,--"
12215,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"The more fools they,--we forward: dreamers both:"
12216,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"You most, that in an age, when every hour"
12217,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Must sweat her sixty minutes to the death,"
12218,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Live on, God love us, as if the seedsman, rapt"
12219,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"Upon the teeming harvest, should not dip [4]"
12220,THE GOLDEN YEAR,His hand into the bag: but well I know
12221,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"That unto him who works, and feels he works,"
12222,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"This same grand year is ever at the doors."""
12223,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"He spoke; and, high above, I heard them blast"
12224,THE GOLDEN YEAR,"The steep slate-quarry, and the great echo flap"
12225,THE GOLDEN YEAR,And buffet round the hills from bluff to bluff.

12254,ULYSSES,
12255,ULYSSES,"This noble poem, which is said to have induced Sir Robert Peel to give"
12256,ULYSSES,"Tennyson his pension, was written soon after Arthur Hallam's death,"
12257,ULYSSES,"presumably therefore in 1833. ""It gave my feeling,"" Tennyson said to his"
12258,ULYSSES,"son, ""about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life"
12259,ULYSSES,"perhaps more simply than anything in 'In Memoriam'."" It is not the"
12260,ULYSSES,"'Ulysses' of Homer, nor was it suggested by the 'Odyssey'. The germ, the"
12261,ULYSSES,spirit and the sentiment of the poem are from the twenty-sixth canto of
12262,ULYSSES,"Dante's 'Inferno', where Ulysses in the Limbo of the Deceivers speaks"
12263,ULYSSES,from the flame which swathes him. I give a literal version of the
12264,ULYSSES,passage:--
12265,ULYSSES,
12266,ULYSSES,"""Neither fondness for my son nor reverence for my aged sire nor the"
12267,ULYSSES,due love which ought to have gladdened Penelope could conquer in me
12268,ULYSSES,the ardour which I had to become experienced in the world and in human
12269,ULYSSES,vice and worth. I put out into the deep open sea with but one ship and
12270,ULYSSES,with that small company which had not deserted me.... I and my
12271,ULYSSES,companions were old and tardy when we came to that narrow pass where
12272,ULYSSES,"Hercules assigned his landmarks. 'O brothers,' I said, 'who through a"
12273,ULYSSES,hundred thousand dangers have reached the West deny not to this the
12274,ULYSSES,"brief vigil of your senses that remain, experience of the unpeopled"
12275,ULYSSES,"world beyond the sun. Consider your origin, ye were not formed to live"
12276,ULYSSES,like Brutes but to follow virtue and knowledge.... Night already saw
12277,ULYSSES,the other pole with all its stars and ours so low that it rose not
12278,ULYSSES,"from the ocean floor'"""
12279,ULYSSES,
12280,ULYSSES,"('Inferno', xxvi., 94-126)."
12281,ULYSSES,
12282,ULYSSES,But if the germ is here the expansion is Tennyson's; he has added
12283,ULYSSES,"elaboration and symmetry, fine touches, magical images and magical"
12284,ULYSSES,diction. There is nothing in Dante which answers to--

12432,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12433,LOCKSLEY HALL,"First published in 1842, and no alterations were made in it subsequently"
12434,LOCKSLEY HALL,to the edition of 1850; except that in the Selections published in 1865
12435,LOCKSLEY HALL,"in the third stanza the reading was ""half in ruin"" for ""in the"
12436,LOCKSLEY HALL,"distance"". This poem, as Tennyson explained, was not autobiographic but"
12437,LOCKSLEY HALL,"purely imaginary, ""representing young life, its good side, its"
12438,LOCKSLEY HALL,"deficiences and its yearnings"". The poem, he added, was written in"
12439,LOCKSLEY HALL,Trochaics because the elder Hallam told him that the English people
12440,LOCKSLEY HALL,liked that metre. The hero is a sort of preliminary sketch of the hero
12441,LOCKSLEY HALL,"in 'Maud', the position and character of each being very similar: both"
12442,LOCKSLEY HALL,"are cynical and querulous, and break out into tirades against their kind"
12443,LOCKSLEY HALL,"and society; both have been disappointed in love, and both find the same"
12444,LOCKSLEY HALL,remedy for their afflictions by mixing themselves with action and
12445,LOCKSLEY HALL,"becoming ""one with their kind""."
12446,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12447,LOCKSLEY HALL,"'Locksley Hall' was suggested, as Tennyson acknowledged, by Sir William"
12448,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Jones' translation of the old Arabian Moâllakât, a collection from the"
12449,LOCKSLEY HALL,"works of pre-Mahommedan poets. See Sir William Jones' works, quarto"
12450,LOCKSLEY HALL,"edition, vol. iv., pp. 247-57. But only one of these poems, namely the"
12451,LOCKSLEY HALL,"poem of Amriolkais, could have immediately influenced him. In this the"
12452,LOCKSLEY HALL,"poet supposes himself attended on a journey by a company of friends, and"
12453,LOCKSLEY HALL,"they pass near a place where his mistress had lately lived, but from"
12454,LOCKSLEY HALL,"which her tribe had then removed. He desires them to stop awhile, that"
12455,LOCKSLEY HALL,he may weep over the deserted remains of her tent. They comply with his
12456,LOCKSLEY HALL,"request, but exhort him to show more strength of mind, and urge two"
12457,LOCKSLEY HALL,"topics of consolation, namely, that he had before been equally unhappy"
12458,LOCKSLEY HALL,and that he had enjoyed his full share of pleasures. Thus by the
12459,LOCKSLEY HALL,recollection of his past delights his imagination is kindled and his
12460,LOCKSLEY HALL,grief suspended. But Tennyson's chief indebtedness is rather in the
12461,LOCKSLEY HALL,"oriental colouring given to his poem, chiefly in the sentiment and"
12462,LOCKSLEY HALL,imagery. Thus in the couplet--
12463,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12464,LOCKSLEY HALL,Many a night I saw the Pleiads rising through the mellow shade
12465,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Glitter like a swarm of fireflies tangl'd in a silver braid,"
12466,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12467,LOCKSLEY HALL,"we are reminded of ""It was the hour when the Pleiads appeared in the"
12468,LOCKSLEY HALL,"firmament like the folds of a silken sash variously decked with gems""."
12469,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12470,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12471,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Comrades, leave me here a little, while as yet 'tis early morn:"
12472,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Leave me here, and when you want me, sound upon the bugle horn."
12473,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12474,LOCKSLEY HALL,"'Tis the place, and all around it, [1] as of old, the curlews call,"
12475,LOCKSLEY HALL,Dreary gleams [2] about the moorland flying over Locksley Hall;
12476,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12477,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Locksley Hall, that in the distance overlooks the sandy tracts,"
12478,LOCKSLEY HALL,And the hollow ocean-ridges roaring into cataracts.
12479,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12480,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Many a night from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest,"

12489,LOCKSLEY HALL,When the centuries behind me like a fruitful land reposed;
12490,LOCKSLEY HALL,When I clung to all the present for the promise that it closed:
12491,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12492,LOCKSLEY HALL,When I dipt into the future far as human eye could see;

12504,LOCKSLEY HALL,"And I said, ""My cousin Amy, speak, and speak the truth to me,"

12512,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12513,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Saying, ""I have hid my feelings, fearing they should do me wrong"";"
12514,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Saying, ""Dost thou love me, cousin?"" weeping, ""I have loved thee"
12515,LOCKSLEY HALL,"long""."
12516,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12517,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it in his glowing hands;"
12518,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands. [4]"
12519,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12520,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with might;"
12521,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of"
12522,LOCKSLEY HALL,sight.
12523,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12524,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Many a morning on the moorland did we hear the copses ring,"
12525,LOCKSLEY HALL,And her whisper throng'd my pulses with the fulness of the Spring.
12526,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12527,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Many an evening by the waters did we watch the stately ships,"
12528,LOCKSLEY HALL,And our spirits rush'd together at the touching of the lips. [5]
12529,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12530,LOCKSLEY HALL,"O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my Amy, mine no more!"
12531,LOCKSLEY HALL,"O the dreary, dreary moorland! O the barren, barren shore!"

12533,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Falser than all fancy fathoms, falser than all songs have sung,"

12535,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12536,LOCKSLEY HALL,Is it well to wish thee happy?--having known me--to decline
12537,LOCKSLEY HALL,On a range of lower feelings and a narrower heart than mine!
12538,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12539,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Yet it shall be: thou shalt lower to his level day by day,"
12540,LOCKSLEY HALL,What is fine within thee growing coarse to sympathise with clay.
12541,LOCKSLEY HALL,

12544,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12545,LOCKSLEY HALL,"He will hold thee, when his passion shall have spent its novel force,"
12546,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse."

12548,LOCKSLEY HALL,What is this? his eyes are heavy: think not they are glazed with wine.

12568,LOCKSLEY HALL,Would to God--for I had loved thee more than ever wife was loved.
12569,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12570,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Am I mad, that I should cherish that which bears but bitter fruit?"

12573,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Never, tho' my mortal summers to such length of years should come"

12576,LOCKSLEY HALL,Where is comfort? in division of the records of the mind?
12577,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Can I part her from herself, and love her, as I knew her, kind?"
12578,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12579,LOCKSLEY HALL,I remember one that perish'd: sweetly did she speak and move:
12580,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Such a one do I remember, whom to look it was to love."
12581,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12582,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Can I think of her as dead, and love her for the love she bore?"
12583,LOCKSLEY HALL,No--she never loved me truly: love is love for evermore.
12584,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12585,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Comfort? comfort scorn'd of devils! this is truth the poet sings,"
12586,LOCKSLEY HALL,That a sorrow's crown of sorrow [7] is remembering happier things.
12587,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12588,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Drug thy memories, lest thou learn it, lest thy heart be put to proof,"
12589,LOCKSLEY HALL,"In the dead unhappy night, and when the rain is on the roof."
12590,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12591,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Like a dog, he hunts in dreams, and thou art staring at the wall,"

12600,LOCKSLEY HALL,"And an eye shall vex thee, looking ancient kindness on thy pain."
12601,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Turn thee, turn thee on thy pillow: get thee to thy rest again."
12602,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12603,LOCKSLEY HALL,"Nay, but Nature brings thee solace; for a tender voice will cry,"
12604,LOCKSLEY HALL,'Tis a purer life than thine; a lip to drain thy trouble dry.

12610,LOCKSLEY HALL,Half is thine and half is his: it will be worthy of the two.
12611,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12612,LOCKSLEY HALL,"O, I see thee old and formal, fitted to thy petty part,"

12614,LOCKSLEY HALL,
12615,LOCKSLEY HALL,"""They were dangerous guides the feelings--she herself was not exempt--"

12942,GODIVA,"He laugh'd, and swore by Peter and by Paul;"

12968,GODIVA,"From pillar unto pillar, until she reach'd"
12969,GODIVA,The gateway; there she found her palfrey trapt
12970,GODIVA,In purple blazon'd with armorial gold.
12971,GODIVA,"Then she rode forth, clothed on with chastity:"
12972,GODIVA,"The deep air listen'd round her as she rode,"
12973,GODIVA,And all the low wind hardly breathed for fear.
12974,GODIVA,The little wide-mouth'd heads upon the spout
12975,GODIVA,Had cunning eyes to see: the barking cur
12976,GODIVA,Made her cheek flame: her palfrey's footfall shot
12977,GODIVA,Light horrors thro' her pulses: the blind walls
12978,GODIVA,Were full of chinks and holes; and overhead
12979,GODIVA,"Fantastic gables, crowding, stared: but she"
12980,GODIVA,"Not less thro' all bore up, till, last, she saw"
12981,GODIVA,The white-flower'd elder-thicket from the field
12982,GODIVA,Gleam thro' the Gothic archways [3]in the wall.
12983,GODIVA,Then she rode back cloth'd on with chastity:
12984,GODIVA,"And one low churl, [4] compact of thankless earth,"
12985,GODIVA,"The fatal byword of all years to come,"
12986,GODIVA,"Boring a little auger-hole in fear,"
12987,GODIVA,"Peep'd--but his eyes, before they had their will,"
12988,GODIVA,"Were shrivell'd into darkness in his head,"
12989,GODIVA,"And dropt before him. So the Powers, who wait"
12990,GODIVA,"On noble deeds, cancell'd a sense misused;"
12991,GODIVA,"And she, that knew not, pass'd: and all at once,"
12992,GODIVA,"With twelve great shocks of sound, the shameless noon"
12993,GODIVA,"Was clash'd and hammer'd from a hundred towers, [5]"
12994,GODIVA,One after one: but even then she gain'd
12995,GODIVA,"Her bower; whence reissuing, robed and crown'd,"
12996,GODIVA,"To meet her lord, she took the tax away,"
12997,GODIVA,And built herself an everlasting name.

13018,THE TWO VOICES,THE TWO VOICES
13019,THE TWO VOICES,
13020,THE TWO VOICES,
13021,THE TWO VOICES,"First published in 1842, though begun as early as 1833 and in course of"
13022,THE TWO VOICES,"composition in 1834. See Spedding's letter dated 19th September, 1834."
13023,THE TWO VOICES,Its original title was 'The Thoughts of a Suicide'. No alterations were
13024,THE TWO VOICES,made in the poem after 1842.
13025,THE TWO VOICES,
13026,THE TWO VOICES,It adds interest to this poem to know that it is autobiographical. It
13027,THE TWO VOICES,was written soon after the death of Arthur Hallam when Tennyson's
13028,THE TWO VOICES,"depression was deepest. ""When I wrote 'The Two Voices' I was so utterly"
13029,THE TWO VOICES,"miserable, a burden to myself and to my family, that I said, 'Is life"
13030,THE TWO VOICES,"worth anything?'"" It is the history--as Spedding put it--of the"
13031,THE TWO VOICES,"agitations, the suggestions and counter-suggestions of a mind sunk in"
13032,THE TWO VOICES,"hopeless despondency, and meditating self-destruction, together with the"
13033,THE TWO VOICES,manner of its recovery to a more healthy condition. We have two
13034,THE TWO VOICES,singularly interesting parallels to it in preceding poetry. The one is
13035,THE TWO VOICES,"in the third book of Lucretius (830-1095), where the arguments for"
13036,THE TWO VOICES,"suicide are urged, not merely by the poet himself, but by arguments"
13037,THE TWO VOICES,"placed by him in the mouth of Nature herself, and urged with such"
13038,THE TWO VOICES,cogency that they are said to have induced one of his editors and
13039,THE TWO VOICES,"translators, Creech, to put an end to his life. The other is in Spenser,"
13040,THE TWO VOICES,"in the dialogue between Despair and the Red Cross Knight, where Despair"
13041,THE TWO VOICES,"puts the case for self-destruction, and the Red Cross Knight rebuts the"
13042,THE TWO VOICES,"arguments ('Faerie Queene', I. ix., st. xxxviii.-liv.)."
13043,THE TWO VOICES,
13044,THE TWO VOICES,
13045,THE TWO VOICES,"A still small voice spake unto me,"
13046,THE TWO VOICES,"""Thou art so full of misery,"
13047,THE TWO VOICES,"Were it not better not to be?"""
13048,THE TWO VOICES,
13049,THE TWO VOICES,Then to the still small voice I said;
13050,THE TWO VOICES,"""Let me not cast in endless shade"
13051,THE TWO VOICES,"What is so wonderfully made""."
13052,THE TWO VOICES,
13053,THE TWO VOICES,To which the voice did urge reply;
13054,THE TWO VOICES,"""To-day I saw the dragon-fly"
13055,THE TWO VOICES,Come from the wells where he did lie.
13056,THE TWO VOICES,
13057,THE TWO VOICES,"""An inner impulse rent the veil"
13058,THE TWO VOICES,Of his old husk: from head to tail
13059,THE TWO VOICES,Came out clear plates of sapphire mail.
13060,THE TWO VOICES,
13061,THE TWO VOICES,"""He dried his wings: like gauze they grew:"
13062,THE TWO VOICES,Thro' crofts and pastures wet with dew
13063,THE TWO VOICES,"A living flash of light he flew."""
13064,THE TWO VOICES,
13065,THE TWO VOICES,"I said, ""When first the world began"
13066,THE TWO VOICES,"Young Nature thro' five cycles ran,"
13067,THE TWO VOICES,And in the sixth she moulded man.
13068,THE TWO VOICES,
13069,THE TWO VOICES,"""She gave him mind, the lordliest"
13070,THE TWO VOICES,"Proportion, and, above the rest,"
13071,THE TWO VOICES,"Dominion in the head and breast."""
13072,THE TWO VOICES,
13073,THE TWO VOICES,Thereto the silent voice replied;
13074,THE TWO VOICES,"""Self-blinded are you by your pride:"
13075,THE TWO VOICES,Look up thro' night: the world is wide.
13076,THE TWO VOICES,
13077,THE TWO VOICES,"""This truth within thy mind rehearse,"
13078,THE TWO VOICES,That in a boundless universe
13079,THE TWO VOICES,"Is boundless better, boundless worse."
13080,THE TWO VOICES,
13081,THE TWO VOICES,"""Think you this mould of hopes and fears"
13082,THE TWO VOICES,Could find no statelier than his peers
13083,THE TWO VOICES,"In yonder hundred million spheres?"""
13084,THE TWO VOICES,
13085,THE TWO VOICES,"It spake, moreover, in my mind:"
13086,THE TWO VOICES,"""Tho' thou wert scatter'd to the wind,"
13087,THE TWO VOICES,"Yet is there plenty of the kind""."
13088,THE TWO VOICES,
13089,THE TWO VOICES,Then did my response clearer fall:
13090,THE TWO VOICES,"""No compound of this earthly ball"
13091,THE TWO VOICES,"Is like another, all in all""."
13092,THE TWO VOICES,
13093,THE TWO VOICES,To which he answer'd scoffingly;
13094,THE TWO VOICES,"""Good soul! suppose I grant it thee,"
13095,THE TWO VOICES,Who'll weep for thy deficiency?
13096,THE TWO VOICES,
13097,THE TWO VOICES,"""Or will one beam [1] be less intense,"
13098,THE TWO VOICES,When thy peculiar difference
13099,THE TWO VOICES,"Is cancell'd in the world of sense?"""
13100,THE TWO VOICES,
13101,THE TWO VOICES,"I would have said, ""Thou canst not know,"""
13102,THE TWO VOICES,"But my full heart, that work'd below,"
13103,THE TWO VOICES,Rain'd thro' my sight its overflow.
13104,THE TWO VOICES,
13105,THE TWO VOICES,Again the voice spake unto me:
13106,THE TWO VOICES,"""Thou art so steep'd in misery,"
13107,THE TWO VOICES,Surely 'twere better not to be.
13108,THE TWO VOICES,
13109,THE TWO VOICES,"""Thine anguish will not let thee sleep,"
13110,THE TWO VOICES,Nor any train of reason keep:
13111,THE TWO VOICES,"Thou canst not think, but thou wilt weep."""
13112,THE TWO VOICES,
13113,THE TWO VOICES,"I said, ""The years with change advance:"
13114,THE TWO VOICES,"If I make dark my countenance,"
13115,THE TWO VOICES,I shut my life from happier chance.
13116,THE TWO VOICES,
13117,THE TWO VOICES,"""Some turn this sickness yet might take,"
13118,THE TWO VOICES,"Ev'n yet."" But he: ""What drug can make"
13119,THE TWO VOICES,"A wither'd palsy cease to shake?"""
13120,THE TWO VOICES,
13121,THE TWO VOICES,"I wept, ""Tho' I should die, I know"
13122,THE TWO VOICES,That all about the thorn will blow
13123,THE TWO VOICES,In tufts of rosy-tinted snow;
13124,THE TWO VOICES,
13125,THE TWO VOICES,"""And men, thro' novel spheres of thought"
13126,THE TWO VOICES,"Still moving after truth long sought,"
13127,THE TWO VOICES,"Will learn new things when I am not."""
13128,THE TWO VOICES,
13129,THE TWO VOICES,"""Yet,"" said the secret voice, ""some time,"
13130,THE TWO VOICES,"Sooner or later, will gray prime"
13131,THE TWO VOICES,Make thy grass hoar with early rime.
13132,THE TWO VOICES,
13133,THE TWO VOICES,"""Not less swift souls that yearn for light,"
13134,THE TWO VOICES,"Rapt after heaven's starry flight,"
13135,THE TWO VOICES,Would sweep the tracts of day and night.
13136,THE TWO VOICES,
13137,THE TWO VOICES,"""Not less the bee would range her cells,"
13138,THE TWO VOICES,"The furzy prickle fire the dells,"
13139,THE TWO VOICES,"The foxglove cluster dappled bells."""
13140,THE TWO VOICES,
13141,THE TWO VOICES,"I said that ""all the years invent;"
13142,THE TWO VOICES,Each month is various to present
13143,THE TWO VOICES,The world with some development.
13144,THE TWO VOICES,
13145,THE TWO VOICES,"""Were this not well, to bide mine hour,"
13146,THE TWO VOICES,Tho' watching from a ruin'd tower
13147,THE TWO VOICES,"How grows the day of human power?"""
13148,THE TWO VOICES,
13149,THE TWO VOICES,"""The highest-mounted mind,"" he said,"
13150,THE TWO VOICES,"""Still sees the sacred morning spread"
13151,THE TWO VOICES,The silent summit overhead.
13152,THE TWO VOICES,
13153,THE TWO VOICES,"""Will thirty seasons render plain"
13154,THE TWO VOICES,"Those lonely lights that still remain,"
13155,THE TWO VOICES,Just breaking over land and main?
13156,THE TWO VOICES,
13157,THE TWO VOICES,"""Or make that morn, from his cold crown"
13158,THE TWO VOICES,"And crystal silence creeping down,"
13159,THE TWO VOICES,Flood with full daylight glebe and town?
13160,THE TWO VOICES,
13161,THE TWO VOICES,"""Forerun thy peers, thy time, and let"
13162,THE TWO VOICES,"Thy feet, millenniums hence, be set"
13163,THE TWO VOICES,"In midst of knowledge, dream'd not yet."
13164,THE TWO VOICES,
13165,THE TWO VOICES,"""Thou hast not gain'd a real height,"
13166,THE TWO VOICES,"Nor art thou nearer to the light,"
13167,THE TWO VOICES,Because the scale is infinite.
13168,THE TWO VOICES,
13169,THE TWO VOICES,"""'Twere better not to breathe or speak,"
13170,THE TWO VOICES,"Than cry for strength, remaining weak,"
13171,THE TWO VOICES,"And seem to find, but still to seek."
13172,THE TWO VOICES,
13173,THE TWO VOICES,"""Moreover, but to seem to find"
13174,THE TWO VOICES,"Asks what thou lackest, thought resign'd,"
13175,THE TWO VOICES,"A healthy frame, a quiet mind."""
13176,THE TWO VOICES,
13177,THE TWO VOICES,"I said, ""When I am gone away,"
13178,THE TWO VOICES,"'He dared not tarry,' men will say,"
13179,THE TWO VOICES,"Doing dishonour to my clay."""
13180,THE TWO VOICES,
13181,THE TWO VOICES,"""This is more vile,"" he made reply,"
13182,THE TWO VOICES,"""To breathe and loathe, to live and sigh,"
13183,THE TWO VOICES,Than once from dread of pain to die.
13184,THE TWO VOICES,
13185,THE TWO VOICES,"""Sick art thou--a divided will"
13186,THE TWO VOICES,Still heaping on the fear of ill
13187,THE TWO VOICES,"The fear of men, a coward still."
13188,THE TWO VOICES,
13189,THE TWO VOICES,"""Do men love thee? Art thou so bound"
13190,THE TWO VOICES,"To men, that how thy name may sound"
13191,THE TWO VOICES,Will vex thee lying underground?
13192,THE TWO VOICES,
13193,THE TWO VOICES,"""The memory of the wither'd leaf"
13194,THE TWO VOICES,In endless time is scarce more brief
13195,THE TWO VOICES,Than of the garner'd Autumn-sheaf.

13197,THE TWO VOICES,"""Go, vexed Spirit, sleep in trust;"

13205,THE TWO VOICES,"""Nay--rather yet that I could raise"
13206,THE TWO VOICES,One hope that warm'd me in the days

13209,THE TWO VOICES,"""When, wide in soul, and bold of tongue,"
13210,THE TWO VOICES,"Among the tents I paused and sung,"
13211,THE TWO VOICES,The distant battle flash'd and rung.
13212,THE TWO VOICES,
13213,THE TWO VOICES,"""I sung the joyful Paean clear,"

13241,THE TWO VOICES,"""In some good cause, not in mine own,"

14311,AMPHION,In this humorous allegory the poet bewails his unhappy lot on having
14312,AMPHION,"fallen on an age so unpropitious to poetry, contrasting it with the"
14313,AMPHION,happy times so responsive to his predecessors who piped to a world
14314,AMPHION,"prepared to dance to their music. However, he must toil and be satisfied"
14315,AMPHION,if he can make a little garden blossom.
14316,AMPHION,
14317,AMPHION,
14318,AMPHION,"My father left a park to me,"
14319,AMPHION,"But it is wild and barren,"
14320,AMPHION,A garden too with scarce a tree
14321,AMPHION,And waster than a warren:
14322,AMPHION,"Yet say the neighbours when they call,"
14323,AMPHION,"It is not bad but good land,"
14324,AMPHION,And in it is the germ of all
14325,AMPHION,That grows within the woodland.
14326,AMPHION,
14327,AMPHION,O had I lived when song was great
14328,AMPHION,"In days of old Amphion, [1]"
14329,AMPHION,"And ta'en my fiddle to the gate,"
14330,AMPHION,Nor cared for seed or scion!
14331,AMPHION,"And had I lived when song was great,"
14332,AMPHION,"And legs of trees were limber,"
14333,AMPHION,"And ta'en my fiddle to the gate,"
14334,AMPHION,And fiddled in the timber!
14335,AMPHION,
14336,AMPHION,"'Tis said he had a tuneful tongue,"
14337,AMPHION,"Such happy intonation,"
14338,AMPHION,Wherever he sat down and sung
14339,AMPHION,He left a small plantation;
14340,AMPHION,Wherever in a lonely grove
14341,AMPHION,"He set up his forlorn pipes,"
14342,AMPHION,"The gouty oak began to move,"
14343,AMPHION,And flounder into hornpipes.
14344,AMPHION,
14345,AMPHION,"The mountain stirr'd its bushy crown,"
14346,AMPHION,"And, as tradition teaches,"
14347,AMPHION,Young ashes pirouetted down

14349,AMPHION,And briony-vine and ivy-wreath
14350,AMPHION,"Ran forward to his rhyming,"
14351,AMPHION,And from the valleys underneath
14352,AMPHION,Came little copses climbing.

14354,AMPHION,The linden broke her ranks and rent
14355,AMPHION,"The woodbine wreathes that bind her,"

14367,AMPHION,
14368,AMPHION,"Came wet-shot alder from the wave,"
14369,AMPHION,"Came yews, a dismal coterie;"
14370,AMPHION,"Each pluck'd his one foot from the grave,"
14371,AMPHION,Poussetting with a sloe-tree:
14372,AMPHION,"Old elms came breaking from the vine,"
14373,AMPHION,"The vine stream'd out to follow,"
14374,AMPHION,"And, sweating rosin, plump'd the pine"
14375,AMPHION,From many a cloudy hollow.
14376,AMPHION,
14377,AMPHION,And wasn't it a sight to see
14378,AMPHION,"When, ere his song was ended,"
14379,AMPHION,"Like some great landslip, tree by tree,"
14380,AMPHION,The country-side descended;
14381,AMPHION,And shepherds from the mountain-caves
14382,AMPHION,"Look'd down, half-pleased, half-frighten'd,"
14383,AMPHION,As dash'd about the drunken leaves
14384,AMPHION,The random sunshine lighten'd!
14385,AMPHION,
14386,AMPHION,"Oh, nature first was fresh to men,"
14387,AMPHION,And wanton without measure;
14388,AMPHION,"So youthful and so flexile then,"
14389,AMPHION,You moved her at your pleasure.
14390,AMPHION,"Twang out, my fiddle! shake the twigs!"
14391,AMPHION,And make her dance attendance;
14392,AMPHION,"Blow, flute, and stir the stiff-set sprigs,"
14393,AMPHION,And scirrhous roots and tendons.
14394,AMPHION,
14395,AMPHION,'Tis vain! in such a brassy age
14396,AMPHION,I could not move a thistle;

14421,AMPHION,
14422,AMPHION,"But these, tho' fed with careful dirt,"
14423,AMPHION,Are neither green nor sappy;

14425,AMPHION,"The spindlings look unhappy, [3]"

14555,SIR GALAHAD,"The shattering trumpet shrilleth high,"
14556,SIR GALAHAD,"The hard brands shiver on the steel,"
14557,SIR GALAHAD,"The splinter'd spear-shafts crack and fly,"
14558,SIR GALAHAD,The horse and rider reel:
14559,SIR GALAHAD,
14560,SIR GALAHAD,"They reel, they roll in clanging lists,"
14561,SIR GALAHAD,"And when the tide of combat stands,"
14562,SIR GALAHAD,"Perfume and flowers fall in showers,"
14563,SIR GALAHAD,That lightly rain from ladies' hands.
14564,SIR GALAHAD,
14565,SIR GALAHAD,How sweet are looks that ladies bend
14566,SIR GALAHAD,On whom their favours fall!
14567,SIR GALAHAD,"For them I battle till the end,"
14568,SIR GALAHAD,To save from shame and thrall:
14569,SIR GALAHAD,"But all my heart is drawn above,"
14570,SIR GALAHAD,My knees are bow'd in crypt and shrine:
14571,SIR GALAHAD,"I never felt the kiss of love,"
14572,SIR GALAHAD,Nor maiden's hand in mine.
14573,SIR GALAHAD,"More bounteous aspects on me beam,"
14574,SIR GALAHAD,Me mightier transports move and thrill;
14575,SIR GALAHAD,So keep I fair thro' faith and prayer
14576,SIR GALAHAD,A virgin heart in work and will.
14577,SIR GALAHAD,
14578,SIR GALAHAD,"When down the stormy crescent goes,"
14579,SIR GALAHAD,"A light before me swims,"
14580,SIR GALAHAD,"Between dark stems the forest glows,"
14581,SIR GALAHAD,I hear a noise of hymns:
14582,SIR GALAHAD,Then by some secret shrine I ride;
14583,SIR GALAHAD,"I hear a voice, but none are there;"
14584,SIR GALAHAD,"The stalls are void, the doors are wide,"
14585,SIR GALAHAD,The tapers burning fair.
14586,SIR GALAHAD,"Fair gleams the snowy altar-cloth,"
14587,SIR GALAHAD,"The silver vessels sparkle clean,"
14588,SIR GALAHAD,"The shrill bell rings, the censer swings,"
14589,SIR GALAHAD,And solemn chaunts resound between.
14590,SIR GALAHAD,
14591,SIR GALAHAD,Sometimes on lonely mountain-meres
14592,SIR GALAHAD,I find a magic bark;
14593,SIR GALAHAD,I leap on board: no helmsman steers:
14594,SIR GALAHAD,I float till all is dark.
14595,SIR GALAHAD,"A gentle sound, an awful light!"
14596,SIR GALAHAD,Three angels bear the holy Grail:
14597,SIR GALAHAD,"With folded feet, in stoles of white,"
14598,SIR GALAHAD,On sleeping wings they sail.
14599,SIR GALAHAD,"Ah, blessed vision! blood of God!"
14600,SIR GALAHAD,"My spirit beats her mortal bars,"
14601,SIR GALAHAD,"As down dark tides the glory slides,"
14602,SIR GALAHAD,And star-like mingles with the stars.
14603,SIR GALAHAD,
14604,SIR GALAHAD,When on my goodly charger borne
14605,SIR GALAHAD,"Thro' dreaming towns I go,"
14606,SIR GALAHAD,"The cock crows ere the Christmas morn,"
14607,SIR GALAHAD,The streets are dumb with snow.
14608,SIR GALAHAD,"The tempest crackles on the leads,"
14609,SIR GALAHAD,"And, ringing, spins from brand and mail;"
14610,SIR GALAHAD,"But o'er the dark a glory spreads,"
14611,SIR GALAHAD,And gilds the driving hail.
14612,SIR GALAHAD,"I leave the plain, I climb the height;"
14613,SIR GALAHAD,No branchy thicket shelter yields;
14614,SIR GALAHAD,But blessed forms in whistling storms
14615,SIR GALAHAD,Fly o'er waste fens and windy fields.
14616,SIR GALAHAD,
14617,SIR GALAHAD,A maiden knight--to me is given
14618,SIR GALAHAD,"Such hope, I know not fear;"
14619,SIR GALAHAD,I yearn to breathe the airs of heaven
14620,SIR GALAHAD,That often meet me here.
14621,SIR GALAHAD,"I muse on joy that will not cease,"
14622,SIR GALAHAD,"Pure spaces clothed in living beams,"
14623,SIR GALAHAD,"Pure lilies of eternal peace,"
14624,SIR GALAHAD,Whose odours haunt my dreams;
14625,SIR GALAHAD,"And, stricken by an angel's hand,"
14626,SIR GALAHAD,"This mortal armour that I wear,"
14627,SIR GALAHAD,"This weight and size, this heart and eyes,"
14628,SIR GALAHAD,"Are touch'd, are turn'd to finest air."
14629,SIR GALAHAD,
14630,SIR GALAHAD,"The clouds are broken in the sky,"
14631,SIR GALAHAD,And thro' the mountain-walls
14632,SIR GALAHAD,A rolling organ-harmony
14633,SIR GALAHAD,"Swells up, and shakes and falls."
14634,SIR GALAHAD,"Then move the trees, the copses nod,"
14635,SIR GALAHAD,"Wings flutter, voices hover clear:"
14636,SIR GALAHAD,"""O just and faithful knight of God!"
14637,SIR GALAHAD,"Ride on! the prize is near""."
14638,SIR GALAHAD,"So pass I hostel, hall, and grange;"
14639,SIR GALAHAD,"By bridge and ford, by park and pale,"
14640,SIR GALAHAD,"All-arm'd I ride, whate'er betide,"
14641,SIR GALAHAD,Until I find the holy Grail.

14677,EDWARD GRAY,"""Cruel, cruel the words I said!"
14678,EDWARD GRAY,Cruelly came they back to-day:

15200,LADY CLARE,First published 1842. After 1851 no alterations were made.
15201,LADY CLARE,
15202,LADY CLARE,This poem was suggested by Miss Ferrier's powerful novel 'The
15203,LADY CLARE,Inheritance'. A comparison with the plot of Miss Ferrier's novel will
15204,LADY CLARE,show with what tact and skill Tennyson has adapted the tale to his
15205,LADY CLARE,"ballad. Thomas St. Clair, youngest son of the Earl of Rossville, marries"
15206,LADY CLARE,"a Miss Sarah Black, a girl of humble and obscure birth. He dies, leaving"
15207,LADY CLARE,"a widow and as is supposed a daughter, Gertrude, who claim the"
15208,LADY CLARE,"protection of Lord Rossville, as the child is heiress presumptive to the"
15209,LADY CLARE,earldom. On Lord Rossville's death she accordingly becomes Countess of
15210,LADY CLARE,"Rossville. She has two lovers, both distant connections, Colonel Delmour"
15211,LADY CLARE,and Edward Lyndsay. At last it is discovered that she was not the
15212,LADY CLARE,"daughter of Thomas St. Clair and her supposed mother, but of one Marion"
15213,LADY CLARE,"La Motte and Jacob Leviston, and that Mrs. St. Clair had adopted her"
15214,LADY CLARE,"when a baby and passed her off as her own child, that she might succeed"
15215,LADY CLARE,to the title. Meanwhile Delmour by the death of his elder brother
15216,LADY CLARE,"succeeds to the title and estates forfeited by the detected foundling,"
15217,LADY CLARE,"but instead of acting as Tennyson's Lord Ronald does, he repudiates her"
15218,LADY CLARE,and marries a duchess. But her other lover Lyndsay is true to her and
15219,LADY CLARE,"marries her. Delmour not long afterwards dies without issue, and Lyndsay"
15220,LADY CLARE,"succeeds to the title, Gertrude then becoming after all Countess of"
15221,LADY CLARE,Rossville. In details Tennyson follows the novel sometimes very closely.
15222,LADY CLARE,"Thus the ""single rose,"" the poor dress, the bitter exclamation about her"
15223,LADY CLARE,"being a beggar born, are from the novel."
15224,LADY CLARE,
15225,LADY CLARE,The 1842 and all editions up to and including 1850 begin with the
15226,LADY CLARE,following stanza and omit stanza 2:--
15227,LADY CLARE,
15228,LADY CLARE,
15229,LADY CLARE,
15230,LADY CLARE,"Lord Ronald courted Lady Clare,"
15231,LADY CLARE,I trow they did not part in scorn;

15459,THE LORD OF BURLEIGH,Her sweet face from brow to chin:
15460,THE LORD OF BURLEIGH,"As it were with shame she blushes,"
15461,THE LORD OF BURLEIGH,And her spirit changed within.

15466,THE LORD OF BURLEIGH,"So she strove against her weakness,"
15467,THE LORD OF BURLEIGH,Tho' at times her spirits sank:
15468,THE LORD OF BURLEIGH,Shaped her heart with woman's meekness
15469,THE LORD OF BURLEIGH,To all duties of her rank:

15478,THE LORD OF BURLEIGH,"Faint she grew, and ever fainter,"
15479,THE LORD OF BURLEIGH,"As she murmur'd ""Oh, that he"

15669,THE VISION OF SIN,"Spedding in 'Edinburgh Review' for April, 1843. The poem concludes by"

15679,THE VISION OF SIN,
15680,THE VISION OF SIN,I had a vision when the night was late:
15681,THE VISION OF SIN,A youth came riding toward a palace-gate.
15682,THE VISION OF SIN,"He rode a horse with wings, that would have flown, [1]"
15683,THE VISION OF SIN,But that his heavy rider kept him down.
15684,THE VISION OF SIN,"And from the palace came a child of sin,"
15685,THE VISION OF SIN,"And took him by the curls, and led him in,"
15686,THE VISION OF SIN,"Where sat a company with heated eyes,"
15687,THE VISION OF SIN,Expecting when a fountain should arise:
15688,THE VISION OF SIN,A sleepy light upon their brows and lips--
15689,THE VISION OF SIN,"As when the sun, a crescent of eclipse,"
15690,THE VISION OF SIN,"Dreams over lake and lawn, and isles and capes--"
15691,THE VISION OF SIN,"Suffused them, sitting, lying, languid shapes,"
15692,THE VISION OF SIN,"By heaps of gourds, and skins of wine, and piles of grapes."
15693,THE VISION OF SIN,
15694,THE VISION OF SIN,
15695,THE VISION OF SIN,2
15696,THE VISION OF SIN,
15697,THE VISION OF SIN,"Then methought I heard a mellow sound,"
15698,THE VISION OF SIN,Gathering up from all the lower ground; [2]
15699,THE VISION OF SIN,Narrowing in to where they sat assembled
15700,THE VISION OF SIN,"Low voluptuous music winding trembled,"
15701,THE VISION OF SIN,"Wov'n in circles: they that heard it sigh'd,"
15702,THE VISION OF SIN,"Panted hand in hand with faces pale,"
15703,THE VISION OF SIN,"Swung themselves, and in low tones replied;"
15704,THE VISION OF SIN,"Till the fountain spouted, showering wide"
15705,THE VISION OF SIN,Sleet of diamond-drift and pearly hail;
15706,THE VISION OF SIN,Then the music touch'd the gates and died;
15707,THE VISION OF SIN,"Rose again from where it seem'd to fail,"
15708,THE VISION OF SIN,"Storm'd in orbs of song, a growing gale;"
15709,THE VISION OF SIN,"Till thronging in and in, to where they waited,"
15710,THE VISION OF SIN,"As 'twere a hundred-throated nightingale,"
15711,THE VISION OF SIN,The strong tempestuous treble throbb'd and palpitated;
15712,THE VISION OF SIN,"Ran into its giddiest whirl of sound,"
15713,THE VISION OF SIN,"Caught the sparkles, and in circles,"
15714,THE VISION OF SIN,"Purple gauzes, golden hazes, liquid mazes,"
15715,THE VISION OF SIN,Flung the torrent rainbow round:
15716,THE VISION OF SIN,"Then they started from their places,"
15717,THE VISION OF SIN,"Moved with violence, changed in hue,"
15718,THE VISION OF SIN,"Caught each other with wild grimaces,"
15719,THE VISION OF SIN,"Half-invisible to the view,"
15720,THE VISION OF SIN,Wheeling with precipitate paces
15721,THE VISION OF SIN,"To the melody, till they flew,"
15722,THE VISION OF SIN,"Hair, and eyes, and limbs, and faces,"
15723,THE VISION OF SIN,"Twisted hard in fierce embraces,"
15724,THE VISION OF SIN,"Like to Furies, like to Graces,"
15725,THE VISION OF SIN,Dash'd together in blinding dew:
15726,THE VISION OF SIN,"Till, kill'd with some luxurious agony,"
15727,THE VISION OF SIN,The nerve-dissolving melody
15728,THE VISION OF SIN,Flutter'd headlong from the sky.

15730,THE VISION OF SIN,
15731,THE VISION OF SIN,3
15732,THE VISION OF SIN,
15733,THE VISION OF SIN,"And then I look'd up toward a mountain-tract,"
15734,THE VISION OF SIN,That girt the region with high cliff and lawn:
15735,THE VISION OF SIN,"I saw that every morning, far withdrawn"
15736,THE VISION OF SIN,"Beyond the darkness and the cataract,"
15737,THE VISION OF SIN,"God made himself an awful rose of dawn, [3]"
15738,THE VISION OF SIN,"Unheeded: and detaching, fold by fold,"
15739,THE VISION OF SIN,"From those still heights, and, slowly drawing near,"
15740,THE VISION OF SIN,"A vapour heavy, hueless, formless, cold,"
15741,THE VISION OF SIN,"Came floating on for many a month and year,"
15742,THE VISION OF SIN,"Unheeded: and I thought I would have spoken,"
15743,THE VISION OF SIN,And warn'd that madman ere it grew too late:
15744,THE VISION OF SIN,"But, as in dreams, I could not. Mine was broken,"
15745,THE VISION OF SIN,"When that cold vapour touch'd the palace-gate,"
15746,THE VISION OF SIN,And link'd again. I saw within my head
15747,THE VISION OF SIN,"A gray and gap-tooth'd man as lean as death,"
15748,THE VISION OF SIN,"Who slowly rode across a wither'd heath,"
15749,THE VISION OF SIN,"And lighted at a ruin'd inn, and said:"

15760,THE VISION OF SIN,See that sheets are on my bed;

15938,THE VISION OF SIN,Once more uprose the mystic mountain-range:
15939,THE VISION OF SIN,"Below were men and horses pierced with worms,"
15940,THE VISION OF SIN,And slowly quickening into lower forms;
15941,THE VISION OF SIN,"By shards and scurf of salt, and scum of dross,"
15942,THE VISION OF SIN,"Old plash of rains, and refuse patch'd with moss,"
15943,THE VISION OF SIN,"Then some one spake [6]: ""Behold! it was a crime"
15944,THE VISION OF SIN,"Of sense avenged by sense that wore with time""."
15945,THE VISION OF SIN,"[7] Another said: ""The crime of sense became"
15946,THE VISION OF SIN,"The crime of malice, and is equal blame""."

15948,THE VISION OF SIN,"A little grain of conscience made him sour""."
15949,THE VISION OF SIN,At last I heard a voice upon the slope
15950,THE VISION OF SIN,"Cry to the summit, ""Is there any hope?"""
15951,THE VISION OF SIN,To which an answer peal'd from that high land.
15952,THE VISION OF SIN,But in a tongue no man could understand;

18193,TIMBUCTOO,
18194,TIMBUCTOO,
18195,TIMBUCTOO,I stood upon the Mountain which o'erlooks
18196,TIMBUCTOO,"The narrow seas, whose rapid interval"
18197,TIMBUCTOO,"Parts Afric from green Europe, when the Sun"
18198,TIMBUCTOO,"Had fall'n below th' Atlantick, and above"
18199,TIMBUCTOO,"The silent Heavens were blench'd with faery light,"
18200,TIMBUCTOO,"Uncertain whether faery light or cloud,"
18201,TIMBUCTOO,"Flowing Southward, and the chasms of deep, deep blue"
18202,TIMBUCTOO,"Slumber'd unfathomable, and the stars"
18203,TIMBUCTOO,Were flooded over with clear glory and pale.
18204,TIMBUCTOO,"I gaz'd upon the sheeny coast beyond,"
18205,TIMBUCTOO,There where the Giant of old Time infixed
18206,TIMBUCTOO,"The limits of his prowess, pillars high"
18207,TIMBUCTOO,Long time eras'd from Earth: even as the sea
18208,TIMBUCTOO,When weary of wild inroad buildeth up
18209,TIMBUCTOO,Huge mounds whereby to stay his yeasty waves.
18210,TIMBUCTOO,And much I mus'd on legends quaint and old
18211,TIMBUCTOO,Which whilome won the hearts of all on Earth
18212,TIMBUCTOO,"Toward their brightness, ev'n as flame draws air;"
18213,TIMBUCTOO,But had their being in the heart of Man
18214,TIMBUCTOO,As air is th' life of flame: and thou wert then
18215,TIMBUCTOO,"A center'd glory--circled Memory,"
18216,TIMBUCTOO,"Divinest Atalantis, whom the waves"
18217,TIMBUCTOO,"Have buried deep, and thou of later name"
18218,TIMBUCTOO,Imperial Eldorado roof'd with gold:
18219,TIMBUCTOO,"Shadows to which, despite all shocks of Change,"
18220,TIMBUCTOO,"All on-set of capricious Accident,"
18221,TIMBUCTOO,Men clung with yearning Hope which would not die.
18222,TIMBUCTOO,As when in some great City where the walls
18223,TIMBUCTOO,"Shake, and the streets with ghastly faces throng'd"
18224,TIMBUCTOO,"Do utter forth a subterranean voice,"
18225,TIMBUCTOO,Among the inner columns far retir'd
18226,TIMBUCTOO,"At midnight, in the lone Acropolis."
18227,TIMBUCTOO,Before the awful Genius of the place
18228,TIMBUCTOO,"Kneels the pale Priestess in deep faith, the while"
18229,TIMBUCTOO,Above her head the weak lamp dips and winks
18230,TIMBUCTOO,Unto the fearful summoning without:
18231,TIMBUCTOO,"Nathless she ever clasps the marble knees,"
18232,TIMBUCTOO,"Bathes the cold hand with tears, and gazeth on"
18233,TIMBUCTOO,Those eyes which wear no light but that wherewith
18234,TIMBUCTOO,Her phantasy informs them. Where are ye
18235,TIMBUCTOO,"Thrones of the Western wave, fair Islands green?"
18236,TIMBUCTOO,"Where are your moonlight halls, your cedarn glooms,"
18237,TIMBUCTOO,The blossoming abysses of your hills?
18238,TIMBUCTOO,Your flowering Capes and your gold-sanded bays
18239,TIMBUCTOO,Blown round with happy airs of odorous winds?
18240,TIMBUCTOO,"Where are the infinite ways which, Seraph-trod,"
18241,TIMBUCTOO,"Wound thro' your great Elysian solitudes,"
18242,TIMBUCTOO,"Whose lowest depths were, as with visible love,"
18243,TIMBUCTOO,"Fill'd with Divine effulgence, circumfus'd,"
18244,TIMBUCTOO,"Flowing between the clear and polish'd stems,"
18245,TIMBUCTOO,And ever circling round their emerald cones
18246,TIMBUCTOO,"In coronals and glories, such as gird"
18247,TIMBUCTOO,The unfading foreheads of the Saints in Heaven?
18248,TIMBUCTOO,"For nothing visible, they say, had birth"
18249,TIMBUCTOO,In that blest ground but it was play'd about
18250,TIMBUCTOO,With its peculiar glory. Then I rais'd
18251,TIMBUCTOO,"My voice and cried ""Wide Afric, doth thy Sun"
18252,TIMBUCTOO,"Lighten, thy hills enfold a City as fair"
18253,TIMBUCTOO,As those which starr'd the night o' the Elder World?
18254,TIMBUCTOO,Or is the rumour of thy Timbuctoo
18255,TIMBUCTOO,"A dream as frail as those of ancient Time?"""
18256,TIMBUCTOO,"A curve of whitening, flashing, ebbing light!"
18257,TIMBUCTOO,A rustling of white wings! The bright descent
18258,TIMBUCTOO,Of a young Seraph! and he stood beside me
18259,TIMBUCTOO,"There on the ridge, and look'd into my face"
18260,TIMBUCTOO,"With his unutterable, shining orbs,"
18261,TIMBUCTOO,So that with hasty motion I did veil
18262,TIMBUCTOO,"My vision with both hands, and saw before me"
18263,TIMBUCTOO,Such colour'd spots as dance athwart the eyes
18264,TIMBUCTOO,Of those that gaze upon the noonday Sun.
18265,TIMBUCTOO,Girt with a Zone of flashing gold beneath
18266,TIMBUCTOO,"His breast, and compass'd round about his brow"
18267,TIMBUCTOO,"With triple arch of everchanging bows,"
18268,TIMBUCTOO,And circled with the glory of living light
18269,TIMBUCTOO,"And alternation of all hues, he stood."
18270,TIMBUCTOO,
18271,TIMBUCTOO,"""O child of man, why muse you here alone"
18272,TIMBUCTOO,"Upon the Mountain, on the dreams of old"
18273,TIMBUCTOO,"Which fill'd the Earth with passing loveliness,"
18274,TIMBUCTOO,"Which flung strange music on the howling winds,"
18275,TIMBUCTOO,And odours rapt from remote Paradise?
18276,TIMBUCTOO,"Thy sense is clogg'd with dull mortality,"
18277,TIMBUCTOO,Thy spirit fetter'd with the bond of clay:
18278,TIMBUCTOO,"Open thine eye and see."" I look'd, but not"
18279,TIMBUCTOO,"Upon his face, for it was wonderful"
18280,TIMBUCTOO,"With its exceeding brightness, and the light"
18281,TIMBUCTOO,Of the great angel mind which look'd from out
18282,TIMBUCTOO,The starry glowing of his restless eyes.
18283,TIMBUCTOO,"I felt my soul grow mighty, and my spirit"
18284,TIMBUCTOO,With supernatural excitation bound
18285,TIMBUCTOO,"Within me, and my mental eye grew large"
18286,TIMBUCTOO,"With such a vast circumference of thought,"
18287,TIMBUCTOO,That in my vanity I seem'd to stand
18288,TIMBUCTOO,Upon the outward verge and bound alone
18289,TIMBUCTOO,Of full beautitude. Each failing sense
18290,TIMBUCTOO,As with a momentary flash of light
18291,TIMBUCTOO,Grew thrillingly distinct and keen. I saw
18292,TIMBUCTOO,"The smallest grain that dappled the dark Earth,"
18293,TIMBUCTOO,"The indistinctest atom in deep air,"
18294,TIMBUCTOO,"The Moon's white cities, and the opal width"
18295,TIMBUCTOO,"Of her small glowing lakes, her silver heights"
18296,TIMBUCTOO,"Unvisited with dew of vagrant cloud,"
18297,TIMBUCTOO,"And the unsounded, undescended depth"
18298,TIMBUCTOO,Of her black hollows. The clear Galaxy
18299,TIMBUCTOO,"Shorn of its hoary lustre, wonderful,"
18300,TIMBUCTOO,Distinct and vivid with sharp points of light
18301,TIMBUCTOO,"Blaze within blaze, an unimagin'd depth"
18302,TIMBUCTOO,And harmony of planet-girded Suns
18303,TIMBUCTOO,"And moon-encircled planets, wheel in wheel,"
18304,TIMBUCTOO,"Arch'd the wan Sapphire. Nay, the hum of men,"
18305,TIMBUCTOO,"Or other things talking in unknown tongues,"
18306,TIMBUCTOO,And notes of busy life in distant worlds
18307,TIMBUCTOO,Beat like a far wave on my anxious ear.
18308,TIMBUCTOO,"A maze of piercing, trackless, thrilling thoughts"
18309,TIMBUCTOO,Involving and embracing each with each
18310,TIMBUCTOO,"Rapid as fire, inextricably link'd,"
18311,TIMBUCTOO,Expanding momently with every sight
18312,TIMBUCTOO,"And sound which struck the palpitating sense,"
18313,TIMBUCTOO,"The issue of strong impulse, hurried through"
18314,TIMBUCTOO,The riv'n rapt brain: as when in some large lake
18315,TIMBUCTOO,"From pressure of descendant crags, which lapse"
18316,TIMBUCTOO,"Disjointed, crumbling from their parent slope"
18317,TIMBUCTOO,"At slender interval, the level calm"
18318,TIMBUCTOO,Is ridg'd with restless and increasing spheres
18319,TIMBUCTOO,"Which break upon each other, each th' effect"
18320,TIMBUCTOO,"Of separate impulse, but more fleet and strong"
18321,TIMBUCTOO,"Than its precursor, till the eye in vain"
18322,TIMBUCTOO,Amid the wild unrest of swimming shade
18323,TIMBUCTOO,Dappled with hollow and alternate rise
18324,TIMBUCTOO,"Of interpenetrated arc, would scan"
18325,TIMBUCTOO,Definite round.
18326,TIMBUCTOO,
18327,TIMBUCTOO,I know not if I shape
18328,TIMBUCTOO,These things with accurate similitude
18329,TIMBUCTOO,"From visible objects, for but dimly now,"
18330,TIMBUCTOO,"Less vivid than a half-forgotten dream,"
18331,TIMBUCTOO,The memory of that mental excellence
18332,TIMBUCTOO,"Comes o'er me, and it may be I entwine"
18333,TIMBUCTOO,The indecision of my present mind
18334,TIMBUCTOO,"With its past clearness, yet it seems to me"
18335,TIMBUCTOO,As even then the torrent of quick thought
18336,TIMBUCTOO,Absorbed me from the nature of itself
18337,TIMBUCTOO,With its own fleetness. Where is he that borne
18338,TIMBUCTOO,"Adown the sloping of an arrowy stream,"
18339,TIMBUCTOO,"Could link his shallop to the fleeting edge,"
18340,TIMBUCTOO,And muse midway with philosophic calm
18341,TIMBUCTOO,Upon the wondrous laws which regulate
18342,TIMBUCTOO,The fierceness of the bounding element?
18343,TIMBUCTOO,My thoughts which long had grovell'd in the slime
18344,TIMBUCTOO,"Of this dull world, like dusky worms which house"
18345,TIMBUCTOO,"Beneath unshaken waters, but at once"
18346,TIMBUCTOO,Upon some earth-awakening day of spring
18347,TIMBUCTOO,"Do pass from gloom to glory, and aloft"
18348,TIMBUCTOO,"Winnow the purple, bearing on both sides"
18349,TIMBUCTOO,Double display of starlit wings which burn
18350,TIMBUCTOO,"Fanlike and fibred, with intensest bloom:"
18351,TIMBUCTOO,"E'en so my thoughts, ere while so low, now felt"
18352,TIMBUCTOO,Unutterable buoyancy and strength
18353,TIMBUCTOO,To bear them upward through the trackless fields
18354,TIMBUCTOO,Of undefin'd existence far and free.
18355,TIMBUCTOO,
18356,TIMBUCTOO,Then first within the South methought I saw
18357,TIMBUCTOO,"A wilderness of spires, and chrystal pile"
18358,TIMBUCTOO,"Of rampart upon rampart, dome on dome,"
18359,TIMBUCTOO,Illimitable range of battlement
18360,TIMBUCTOO,"On battlement, and the Imperial height"
18361,TIMBUCTOO,Of Canopy o'ercanopied.
18362,TIMBUCTOO,
18363,TIMBUCTOO,"Behind,"
18364,TIMBUCTOO,"In diamond light, upsprung the dazzling Cones"
18365,TIMBUCTOO,"Of Pyramids, as far surpassing Earth's"
18366,TIMBUCTOO,As Heaven than Earth is fairer. Each aloft
18367,TIMBUCTOO,Upon his narrow'd Eminence bore globes
18368,TIMBUCTOO,"Of wheeling suns, or stars, or semblances"
18369,TIMBUCTOO,"Of either, showering circular abyss"
18370,TIMBUCTOO,Of radiance. But the glory of the place
18371,TIMBUCTOO,Stood out a pillar'd front of burnish'd gold
18372,TIMBUCTOO,"Interminably high, if gold it were"
18373,TIMBUCTOO,"Or metal more ethereal, and beneath"
18374,TIMBUCTOO,"Two doors of blinding brilliance, where no gaze"
18375,TIMBUCTOO,"Might rest, stood open, and the eye could scan"
18376,TIMBUCTOO,"Through length of porch and lake and boundless hall,"
18377,TIMBUCTOO,"Part of a throne of fiery flame, where from"
18378,TIMBUCTOO,"The snowy skirting of a garment hung,"
18379,TIMBUCTOO,And glimpse of multitudes of multitudes
18380,TIMBUCTOO,That minister'd around it--if I saw
18381,TIMBUCTOO,"These things distinctly, for my human brain"
18382,TIMBUCTOO,"Stagger'd beneath the vision, and thick night"
18383,TIMBUCTOO,"Came down upon my eyelids, and I fell."
18384,TIMBUCTOO,
18385,TIMBUCTOO,With ministering hand he rais'd me up;
18386,TIMBUCTOO,"Then with a mournful and ineffable smile,"
18387,TIMBUCTOO,Which but to look on for a moment fill'd
18388,TIMBUCTOO,"My eyes with irresistible sweet tears,"
18389,TIMBUCTOO,"In accents of majestic melody,"
18390,TIMBUCTOO,Like a swol'n river's gushings in still night
18391,TIMBUCTOO,"Mingled with floating music, thus he spake:"
18392,TIMBUCTOO,
18393,TIMBUCTOO,"""There is no mightier Spirit than I to sway"
18394,TIMBUCTOO,The heart of man: and teach him to attain
18395,TIMBUCTOO,By shadowing forth the Unattainable;
18396,TIMBUCTOO,And step by step to scale that mighty stair
18397,TIMBUCTOO,Whose landing-place is wrapt about with clouds
18398,TIMBUCTOO,"Of glory of Heaven. [1] With earliest Light of Spring,"
18399,TIMBUCTOO,"And in the glow of sallow Summertide,"
18400,TIMBUCTOO,And in red Autumn when the winds are wild
18401,TIMBUCTOO,"With gambols, and when full-voiced Winter roofs"
18402,TIMBUCTOO,"The headland with inviolate white snow,"
18403,TIMBUCTOO,"I play about his heart a thousand ways,"
18404,TIMBUCTOO,"Visit his eyes with visions, and his ears"
18405,TIMBUCTOO,With harmonies of wind and wave and wood--
18406,TIMBUCTOO,"Of winds which tell of waters, and of waters"
18407,TIMBUCTOO,Betraying the close kisses of the wind--
18408,TIMBUCTOO,And win him unto me: and few there be
18409,TIMBUCTOO,So gross of heart who have not felt and known
18410,TIMBUCTOO,A higher than they see: They with dim eyes
18411,TIMBUCTOO,Behold me darkling. Lo! I have given thee
18412,TIMBUCTOO,"To understand my presence, and to feel"
18413,TIMBUCTOO,My fullness; I have fill'd thy lips with power.
18414,TIMBUCTOO,"I have rais'd thee nigher to the Spheres of Heaven,"
18415,TIMBUCTOO,"Man's first, last home: and thou with ravish'd sense"
18416,TIMBUCTOO,Listenest the lordly music flowing from
18417,TIMBUCTOO,"Th'illimitable years. I am the Spirit,"
18418,TIMBUCTOO,The permeating life which courseth through
18419,TIMBUCTOO,All th' intricate and labyrinthine veins
18420,TIMBUCTOO,"Of the great vine of Fable, which, outspread"
18421,TIMBUCTOO,"With growth of shadowing leaf and clusters rare,"
18422,TIMBUCTOO,"Reacheth to every corner under Heaven,"
18423,TIMBUCTOO,Deep-rooted in the living soil of truth:
