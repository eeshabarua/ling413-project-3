568,PREFATORY NOTE,
569,PREFATORY NOTE,
570,PREFATORY NOTE,The American Bibliography is almost entirely the work of Mrs. St. John
571,PREFATORY NOTE,"of Ithaca, and is the result of laborious and careful critical research"
572,PREFATORY NOTE,on her part. The French Bibliography is not so full. I have been
573,PREFATORY NOTE,"assisted in it mainly by M. Legouis at Lyons, and by workers at the"
574,PREFATORY NOTE,"British Museum. I have also collected a German Bibliography, but it is"
575,PREFATORY NOTE,in too incomplete a state for publication in its present form.
576,PREFATORY NOTE,
577,PREFATORY NOTE,The English Bibliography is fuller than any of its predecessors; but
578,PREFATORY NOTE,"there is no such thing as finality in such work, especially when an"
579,PREFATORY NOTE,addition to the literature of the subject is made nearly every week.
580,PREFATORY NOTE,"Many kind friends, and coadjutors, have assisted me in it, amongst whom"
581,PREFATORY NOTE,"I may mention Dr. Garnett of the British Museum, and _very specially_"
582,PREFATORY NOTE,"Mr. Tutin, of Hull, and also Mr. John J. Smith, St. Andrews, and Mr."
583,PREFATORY NOTE,"Maclauchlan, Dundee. If I omit, either here or elsewhere, to record the"
584,PREFATORY NOTE,"assistance which I have received from any one, in my efforts to make"
585,PREFATORY NOTE,this edition of Wordsworth as perfect as is possible at this stage of
586,PREFATORY NOTE,"literary criticism and editorship, I sincerely regret it; but many of"
587,PREFATORY NOTE,my correspondents have specially requested that no mention should be
588,PREFATORY NOTE,made of their names or their services.
589,PREFATORY NOTE,
590,PREFATORY NOTE,In the Preface to the first volume of this edition there was an
591,PREFATORY NOTE,"unfortunate omission. In returning the final proofs to press, I"
592,PREFATORY NOTE,"accidentally transmitted an uncorrected one, in which two names did"
593,PREFATORY NOTE,"not appear. They were those of Mr. Thomas Hutchinson, Dublin, and"
594,PREFATORY NOTE,"Mr. S. C. Hill, of Hughli College, Bengal. The former kindly revised"
595,PREFATORY NOTE,"most of the sheets of Volumes I. and II., and corrected errors,"
596,PREFATORY NOTE,besides making other valuable suggestions and additions. When his own
597,PREFATORY NOTE,"Clarendon Press edition of Wordsworth was being prepared for press,"
598,PREFATORY NOTE,Mr. Hutchinson asked permission to incorporate in it materials which
599,PREFATORY NOTE,"were not afterwards inserted. This I granted cordially, as a similar"
600,PREFATORY NOTE,permission had been given to Professor Dowden for his Aldine edition.
601,PREFATORY NOTE,The unfortunate omission of Mr. Hutchinson’s name was not discovered
602,PREFATORY NOTE,by me till after the issue of volumes I. and II. (which appeared
603,PREFATORY NOTE,"simultaneously), and it was first brought under my notice by Mr."
604,PREFATORY NOTE,Hutchinson’s own letters to the newspapers. My debt to Mr. Hutchinson
605,PREFATORY NOTE,"is great; and, although I have already thanked him for the services"
606,PREFATORY NOTE,which he has rendered to the world in connection with Wordsworthian
607,PREFATORY NOTE,"literature, I may perhaps be allowed to repeat the acknowledgment now."
608,PREFATORY NOTE,"The revised sheets of Vols. I. and II. of this edition were, however,"
609,PREFATORY NOTE,submitted to others at the same time that they were sent to Mr.
610,PREFATORY NOTE,"Hutchinson; more especially to the late Mr. Dykes Campbell, and on his"
611,PREFATORY NOTE,"death to Mr. Belinfante, and then to the late Mr. Kinghorn, all of whom"
612,PREFATORY NOTE,were engaged by my publishers to assist in the work entrusted to me.
613,PREFATORY NOTE,"They “turned on the microscope” on my own work, and Mr. Hutchinson’s;"
614,PREFATORY NOTE,and to them I have been indebted in many ways.
615,PREFATORY NOTE,
616,PREFATORY NOTE,"Mr. Hill’s services, in tracing the sources of numerous quotations from"
617,PREFATORY NOTE,"other poets which occur in Wordsworth’s text, have been great. He sent"
618,PREFATORY NOTE,"me his discoveries, unsolicited, and I wish to express very cordially"
619,PREFATORY NOTE,my indebtedness to him. To discover some of these quotations--there
620,PREFATORY NOTE,"are several hundreds of them--cost me much labour, before I had the"
621,PREFATORY NOTE,"pleasure of hearing from, or knowing, Mr. Hill; and his assistance"
622,PREFATORY NOTE,in this matter has been greater than that of any other person. It
623,PREFATORY NOTE,will be seen that I have failed--after much study and extensive
624,PREFATORY NOTE,correspondence--to discover them all.
625,PREFATORY NOTE,
626,PREFATORY NOTE,In addition to actual quotations--indicated by Wordsworth by inverted
627,PREFATORY NOTE,"commas in his poems--to trace parallel passages from other poets, or"
628,PREFATORY NOTE,"phrases which may have suggested to him what he recast and glorified,"
629,PREFATORY NOTE,"has seemed to me work not unworthy of accomplishment. At the same time,"
630,PREFATORY NOTE,"and in the same connection, to discover the somewhat similar debts"
631,PREFATORY NOTE,"of later poets to Wordsworth, and to indicate this here and there in"
632,PREFATORY NOTE,"footnotes, may not be wholly useless to posterity."
633,PREFATORY NOTE,
634,PREFATORY NOTE,"My obligations to my friend, Mr. Dykes Campbell, are greater than I can"
635,PREFATORY NOTE,"adequately express. He supplied me with much material, drawn from many"
636,PREFATORY NOTE,"quarters; and, although he did not always mention his sources, I had"
637,PREFATORY NOTE,"implicit confidence in him, both as a literary man and a friend. After"
638,PREFATORY NOTE,"his death, through the kindness of Mrs. Campbell, I examined some MS."
639,PREFATORY NOTE,"volumes of _Wordsworthiana_ written by him, which were of much use to"
640,PREFATORY NOTE,me.
641,PREFATORY NOTE,
642,PREFATORY NOTE,"Some of these were from unknown sources, which I should perhaps have"
643,PREFATORY NOTE,"traced out before making use of them, but, in all my Wordsworth work, I"
644,PREFATORY NOTE,have acted from first to last on the legal opinion of a distinguished
645,PREFATORY NOTE,"Judge, that the heir of the writer of literary work could alone"
646,PREFATORY NOTE,"authorise its subsequent publication; and, since the heirs of the Poet"
647,PREFATORY NOTE,"had kindly given me permission to collect and publish his works, I did"
648,PREFATORY NOTE,"so, with a view to the benefit of posterity."
649,PREFATORY NOTE,
650,PREFATORY NOTE,Some of Mr. Campbell’s material was derived from MSS. now in the
651,PREFATORY NOTE,"possession of Mr. T. Norton Longman, and I have to express my sincere"
652,PREFATORY NOTE,regret that in the earlier volumes I copied from Mr. Campbell’s
653,PREFATORY NOTE,transcripts of these MSS.--which were lent to him on the condition
654,PREFATORY NOTE,that no public use should be made of them without Mr. Longman’s
655,PREFATORY NOTE,"permission--some variations of the text, without mentioning the source"
656,PREFATORY NOTE,whence they were derived.
657,PREFATORY NOTE,
658,PREFATORY NOTE,I was unaware that these MSS. were lent to Mr. Campbell with the
659,PREFATORY NOTE,"condition attached, and regret very much that I am unable to trust my"
660,PREFATORY NOTE,memory to indicate now what variations of text I have quoted from them.
661,PREFATORY NOTE,But I may add that Mr. Longman is about to publish a work which will
662,PREFATORY NOTE,enable Wordsworth students to become practically acquainted with the
663,PREFATORY NOTE,contents of his MSS.
664,PREFATORY NOTE,
665,PREFATORY NOTE,In reference to the poems not published by Wordsworth or his sister
666,PREFATORY NOTE,"during their lifetime, I have included in this volume not only fugitive"
667,PREFATORY NOTE,"pieces printed in Magazines and elsewhere, but also those which have"
668,PREFATORY NOTE,been since recovered from numerous manuscript sources. They are of
669,PREFATORY NOTE,"varying merit. It would be interesting to know, and to record in every"
670,PREFATORY NOTE,"instance, where these manuscripts now are; but this is impossible. In"
671,PREFATORY NOTE,many cases the manuscripts have recently changed ownership. I have
672,PREFATORY NOTE,"obtained a sight of many of them, and have been granted permission to"
673,PREFATORY NOTE,"transcribe them, from the fortunate possessors of large autograph"
674,PREFATORY NOTE,"collections, and also from dealers in autographs; but, after the sale"
675,PREFATORY NOTE,"of manuscripts at public auction-rooms, it is, as a rule, impossible to"
676,PREFATORY NOTE,trace them.
677,PREFATORY NOTE,
678,PREFATORY NOTE,In many cases the MS. variants which have been published in previous
679,PREFATORY NOTE,"volumes occur in copies of the poems, transcribed by the Wordsworth"
680,PREFATORY NOTE,household in private letters to friends. I have occasionally indicated
681,PREFATORY NOTE,"this in footnotes; but, to have done so always would have disfigured"
682,PREFATORY NOTE,"the pages, and frequently the notes would have been longer than the"
683,PREFATORY NOTE,text. To trace the present possessors of the MSS. would be well-nigh
684,PREFATORY NOTE,impossible. It is perhaps worth mentioning that in several cases
685,PREFATORY NOTE,"Wordsworth entered as “misprints” in future editions, what some of his"
686,PREFATORY NOTE,"editors have considered “new readings.” _E.g._ in _The Excursion_, book"
687,PREFATORY NOTE,"ix. l. 679, “wild” demeanour, instead of “mild” demeanour."
688,PREFATORY NOTE,
689,PREFATORY NOTE,"On Nov. 4, 1893, Mr. Aubrey de Vere wrote to me--"
690,PREFATORY NOTE,
691,PREFATORY NOTE,"“I earnestly hope that, in your ‘monumental edition,’ you will"
692,PREFATORY NOTE,"restore the _Ode, Intimations of Immortality_, to the place"
693,PREFATORY NOTE,"which Wordsworth always assigned to it, that of the High Altar"
694,PREFATORY NOTE,of his poetic Cathedral; remitting Quillinan’s laureate Ode
695,PREFATORY NOTE,"on an unworthy, because ‘occasional,’ subject to an Appendix,"
696,PREFATORY NOTE,as a work that at the time of publication was attributed to
697,PREFATORY NOTE,"Wordsworth, but was written by another, though it probably"
698,PREFATORY NOTE,"was seen by him, and had a line or two of his in it, and"
699,PREFATORY NOTE,corrections by him.
700,PREFATORY NOTE,
701,PREFATORY NOTE,“This is certainly the truth; and I should think that he
702,PREFATORY NOTE,"probably himself told all that truth to the officials, when"
703,PREFATORY NOTE,transmitting the Ode; but that they concealed the circumstance;
704,PREFATORY NOTE,"and that Wordsworth, then profoundly depressed in spirits, gave"
705,PREFATORY NOTE,"no more thought to the subject, and soon forgot all about it.…"

711,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"It was in compliance with Mr. Aubrey de Vere’s request that, in this"
712,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"edition, I departed, in a single instance, from the chronological"
713,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,arrangement of the poems.
714,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,
715,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,It may not be too trivial a detail to mention that I gladly gave
716,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,permission to other editors of Wordsworth to make use of any of the
717,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"material which I discovered, and brought together, in former editions;"
718,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"_e.g._ to Mr. George, in Boston, for his edition of _The Prelude_ (in"
719,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"which, if the reader, or critic, compares my original edition with his"
720,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"notes, he will see what Mr. George has done); and to Professor Dowden,"
721,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"Trinity College, Dublin, for his most admirable Aldine edition. For the"
722,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,latter--which will always hold a high place in Wordsworth literature--I
723,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,placed everything asked from me at the disposal of Mr. Dowden.
724,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,
725,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"While these sheets are passing through the press, Dr. Garnett, of the"
726,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,British Museum--one of the kindest and ablest of bibliographers--has
727,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"forwarded to me a contribution, previously sent by him to _The"
728,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"Academy_, and printed in its issue of January 2, 1897."
729,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,
730,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,I have no means of knowing--or of ultimately discovering--whether that
731,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"sonnet, printed as Wordsworth’s, is really his. Dr. Garnett says, in"
732,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"his letter to me, “The verses were undoubtedly in Wordsworth’s hand”;"
733,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"and, he adds, “I think they should be preserved, because they are"
734,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"Wordsworth’s, and as an additional proof of his regard for Camoens,"
735,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,whom he enumerates elsewhere among great sonnet-writers. I have added
736,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"a version of the quatrains, that the piece may be complete. From the"
737,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"character of the handwriting, the lines would seem to have been written"
738,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,down in old age; and I am not quite certain of the word which I have
739,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,transcribed as ‘Austral.’”
740,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,
741,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"Vasco, whose bold and happy mainyard spread"
742,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,Sunward thy sails where dawning glory dyed
743,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,Heaven’s Orient gate; whose westering prow the tide

745,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"Not sterner toil than thine, or strife more dread,"
746,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"Or nobler laud to nobler lyre allied,"
747,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"His, who did baffled Polypheme deride;"
748,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"Or his, whose scaring shaft the Harpy fled."
749,“AUBREY DE VERE.”,"Camoens, he the accomplished and the good,"

1777,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"pay that family a visit of some length, and was upon terms of intimate"
1778,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"friendship with Mrs. Hoare, and still more with her daughter-in-law,"
1779,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,who has a large collection of his letters addressed to herself. After
1780,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"the Poet’s decease, application was made to her to give up these"
1781,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"letters to his biographer, that they, or at least part of them, might"
1782,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"be given to the public. She hesitated to comply, and asked my opinion"
1783,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"on the subject. “By no means,” was my answer, grounded not upon any"
1784,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"objection there might be to publishing a selection from these letters,"
1785,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,but from an aversion I have always felt to meet idle curiosity by
1786,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,calling back the recently departed to become the object of trivial
1787,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,and familiar gossip. Crabbe obviously for the most part preferred the
1788,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"company of women to that of men, for this among other reasons, that"
1789,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,he did not like to be put upon the stretch in general conversation:
1790,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,accordingly in miscellaneous society his _talk_ was so much below what
1791,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"might have been expected from a man so deservedly celebrated, that to"
1792,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,me it seemed trifling. It must upon other occasions have been of a
1793,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"different character, as I found in our rambles together on Hampstead"
1794,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"Heath, and not so much from a readiness to communicate his knowledge"
1795,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,of life and manners as of natural history in all its branches. His
1796,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"mind was inquisitive, and he seems to have taken refuge from the"
1797,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"remembrance of the distresses he had gone through, in these studies"
1798,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"and the employments to which they led. Moreover, such contemplations"
1799,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,might tend profitably to counterbalance the painful truths which he had
1800,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,collected from his intercourse with mankind. Had I been more intimate
1801,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"with him, I should have ventured to touch upon his office as a minister"
1802,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"of the Gospel, and how far his heart and soul were in it so as to make"
1803,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"him a zealous and diligent labourer: in poetry, though he wrote much"
1804,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"as we all know, he assuredly was not so. I happened once to speak of"
1805,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,pains as necessary to produce merit of a certain kind which I highly
1806,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,valued: his observation was--“It is not worth while.” You are quite
1807,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"right, thought I, if the labour encroaches upon the time due to teach"
1808,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,truth as a steward of the mysteries of God: if there be cause to fear
1809,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"_that_, write less: but, if poetry is to be produced at all, make"
1810,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,what you do produce as good as you can. Mr. Rogers once told me that
1811,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,he expressed his regret to Crabbe that he wrote in his later works so
1812,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"much less correctly than in his earlier. “Yes,” replied he, “but then"
1813,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,I had a reputation to make; now I can afford to relax.” Whether it
1814,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"was from a modest estimate of his own qualifications, or from causes"
1815,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"less creditable, his motives for writing verse and his hopes and aims"
1816,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,were not so high as is to be desired. After being silent for more than
1817,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"twenty years, he again applied himself to poetry, upon the spur of"
1818,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"applause he received from the periodical publications of the day, as he"
1819,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,himself tells us in one of his prefaces. Is it not to be lamented that
1820,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"a man who was so conversant with permanent truth, and whose writings"
1821,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"are so valuable an acquisition to our country’s literature, should have"
1822,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,_required_ an impulse from such a quarter? Mrs. Hemans was unfortunate
1823,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"as a poetess in being obliged by circumstances to write for money, and"
1824,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"that so frequently and so much, that she was compelled to look out for"
1825,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"subjects wherever she could find them, and to write as expeditiously as"
1826,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"possible. As a woman, she was to a considerable degree a spoilt child"
1827,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"of the world. She had been early in life distinguished for talent, and"
1828,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,poems of hers were published while she was a girl. She had also been
1829,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"handsome in her youth, but her education had been most unfortunate."
1830,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"She was totally ignorant of housewifery, and could as easily have"
1831,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,managed the spear of Minerva as her needle. It was from observing these
1832,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"deficiencies, that, one day while she was under my roof, I _purposely_"
1833,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"directed her attention to household economy, and told her I had"
1834,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,purchased _Scales_ which I intended to present to a young lady as a
1835,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,wedding present; pointed out their utility (for her especial benefit)
1836,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"and said that no ménage ought to be without them. Mrs. Hemans, not in"
1837,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"the least suspecting my drift, reported this saying, in a letter to a"
1838,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"friend at the time, as a proof of my simplicity. Being disposed to make"
1839,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,large allowances for the faults of her education and the circumstances
1840,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"in which she was placed, I felt most kindly disposed towards her, and"
1841,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"took her part upon all occasions, and I was not a little affected"
1842,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"by learning that after she withdrew to Ireland, a long and severe"
1843,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,sickness raised her spirit as it depressed her body. This I heard from
1844,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"her most intimate friends, and there is striking evidence of it in a"
1845,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,poem written and published not long before her death. These notices
1846,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"of Mrs. Hemans would be very unsatisfactory to her intimate friends,"
1847,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"as indeed they are to myself, not so much for what is said, but what"
1848,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"for brevity’s sake is left unsaid. Let it suffice to add, there was"
1849,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"much sympathy between us, and, if opportunity had been allowed me to"
1850,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"see more of her, I should have loved and valued her accordingly; as it"
1851,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"is, I remember her with true affection for her amiable qualities, and,"
1852,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"above all, for her delicate and irreproachable conduct during her long"
1853,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"separation from an unfeeling husband, whom she had been led to marry"
1854,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,from the romantic notions of inexperienced youth. Upon this husband I
1855,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"never heard her cast the least reproach, nor did I ever hear her even"
1856,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,"name him, though she did not wholly forbear to touch upon her domestic"
1857,EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH OF JAMES HOGG,position; but never so that any fault could be found with her manner of

2316,NOVEMBER 1836,[58] Sarah Hutchinson--Mrs. Wordsworth’s sister--died at Rydal on the
2317,NOVEMBER 1836,23rd June 1836. It was after her that the poet named one of the two
2318,NOVEMBER 1836,"“heath-clad rocks” referred to in the “Poems on the naming of Places,”"
2319,NOVEMBER 1836,and which he called respectively “Mary-Point” and “Sarah-Point.” In

2322,NOVEMBER 1836,"Excuse is needless when with love sincere,"

2335,NOVEMBER 1836,I saw her lying in death I could not resist the impulse to compose the
2336,NOVEMBER 1836,sonnet that follows it.” (See vol. iv. p. 46.)
2337,NOVEMBER 1836,
2338,NOVEMBER 1836,"In a letter to Southey (unpublished), Wordsworth refers to her death,"
2339,NOVEMBER 1836,"and adds: “I saw her within an hour after her decease, in the silence"
2340,NOVEMBER 1836,"and peace of death, with as heavenly an expression on her countenance"
2341,NOVEMBER 1836,as ever human creature had. Surely there is food for faith in these
2342,NOVEMBER 1836,"appearances: for myself, I can say that I have passed a wakeful night,"

2614,"APRIL, 1837",scrambled along that horn of the mountain called “Striding Edge.” Our
2615,"APRIL, 1837","progress was necessarily slow, and was beguiled by Scott’s telling many"

2617,"APRIL, 1837",have probably been better pleased if other topics had occasionally been

2635,"APRIL, 1837",during my residence at Rome I have gratefully acknowledged with
2636,"APRIL, 1837",expressions of sincere regret that she is no more. Miss M. told me
2637,"APRIL, 1837","that she accompanied Sir Walter to the Janicular Mount, and, after"
2638,"APRIL, 1837","showing him the grave of Tasso in the church upon the top, and a mural"
2639,"APRIL, 1837","monument, there erected to his memory, they left the church and stood"
2640,"APRIL, 1837",together on the brow of the hill overlooking the City of Rome: his
2641,"APRIL, 1837","daughter Anne was with them, and she, naturally desirous, for the sake"
2642,"APRIL, 1837","of Miss Mackenzie especially, to have some expression of pleasure from"
2643,"APRIL, 1837","her father, half reproached him for showing nothing of that kind either"
2644,"APRIL, 1837","by his looks or voice: “How can I,” replied he, “having only one leg"
2645,"APRIL, 1837","to stand upon, and that in extreme pain!” so that the prophecy was more"

2650,"APRIL, 1837",We took boat near the lighthouse at the point of the right horn of
2651,"APRIL, 1837",the bay which makes a sort of natural port for Genoa; but the wind
2652,"APRIL, 1837","was high, and the waves long and rough, so that I did not feel quite"
2653,"APRIL, 1837","recompensed by the view of the city, splendid as it was, for the danger"
2654,"APRIL, 1837",apparently incurred. The boatman (I had only one) encouraged me saying
2655,"APRIL, 1837","we were quite safe, but I was not a little glad when we gained the"
2656,"APRIL, 1837","shore, though Shelley and Byron--one of them at least, who seemed to"
2657,"APRIL, 1837",have courted agitation from any quarter--would have probably rejoiced
2658,"APRIL, 1837",in such a situation: more than once I believe were they both in extreme
2659,"APRIL, 1837","danger even on the lake of Geneva. Every man, however, has his fears"
2660,"APRIL, 1837",of some kind or other; and no doubt they had theirs: of all men whom I
2661,"APRIL, 1837","have ever known, Coleridge had the most of passive courage in bodily"
2662,"APRIL, 1837","peril, but no one was so easily cowed when moral firmness was required"
2663,"APRIL, 1837",in miscellaneous conversation or in the daily intercourse of social
2664,"APRIL, 1837",life.

2670,"APRIL, 1837",There is not a single bay along this beautiful coast that might not
2671,"APRIL, 1837","raise in a traveller a wish to take up his abode there, each as it"
2672,"APRIL, 1837",succeeds seems more inviting than the other; but the desolated convent
2673,"APRIL, 1837","on the cliff in the bay of Savona struck my fancy most; and had I, for"
2674,"APRIL, 1837","the sake of my own health or that of a dear friend, or any other cause,"
2675,"APRIL, 1837","been desirous of a residence abroad, I should have let my thoughts"
2676,"APRIL, 1837",loose upon a scheme of turning some part of this building into a
2677,"APRIL, 1837",habitation provided as far as might be with English comforts. There is
2678,"APRIL, 1837","close by it a row or avenue, I forget which, of tall cypresses. I could"
2679,"APRIL, 1837","not forbear saying to myself--“What a sweet family walk, or one for"
2680,"APRIL, 1837","lonely musings, would be found under the shade!” but there, probably,"
2681,"APRIL, 1837",the trees remained little noticed and seldom enjoyed.

2683,"APRIL, 1837",This flowering broom’s dear neighbourhood.
2684,"APRIL, 1837",
2685,"APRIL, 1837",The broom is a great ornament through the months of March and April to
2686,"APRIL, 1837","the vales and hills of the Apennines, in the wild parts of which it"
2687,"APRIL, 1837","blows in the utmost profusion, and of course successively at different"
2688,"APRIL, 1837",elevations as the season advances. It surpasses ours in beauty and
2689,"APRIL, 1837","fragrance,[62] but, speaking from my own limited observations only,"
2690,"APRIL, 1837","I cannot affirm the same of several of their wild spring flowers,"

3707,MAY 25TH 1837,[Among a thousand delightful feelings connected in my mind with
3708,MAY 25TH 1837,"the voice of the cuckoo, there is a personal one which is rather"
3709,MAY 25TH 1837,melancholy. I was first convinced that age had rather dulled my
3710,MAY 25TH 1837,"hearing, by not being able to catch the sound at the same distance as"
3711,MAY 25TH 1837,the younger companions of my walks; and of this failure I had a proof
3712,MAY 25TH 1837,upon the occasion that suggested these verses. I did not hear the sound
3713,MAY 25TH 1837,till Mr. Robinson had twice or thrice directed my attention to it.]
3714,MAY 25TH 1837,
3715,MAY 25TH 1837,List--’twas the Cuckoo.--O with what delight
3716,MAY 25TH 1837,"Heard I that voice! and catch it now, though faint,[131]"
3717,MAY 25TH 1837,"Far off and faint, and melting into air,"
3718,MAY 25TH 1837,Yet not to be mistaken. Hark again!
3719,MAY 25TH 1837,"Those louder cries give notice that the Bird,                      5"
3720,MAY 25TH 1837,"Although invisible as Echo’s self,[132]"
3721,MAY 25TH 1837,"Is wheeling hitherward. Thanks, happy Creature,"
3722,MAY 25TH 1837,For this unthought-of greeting!
3723,MAY 25TH 1837,While allured
3724,MAY 25TH 1837,"From vale to hill, from hill to vale led on,"
3725,MAY 25TH 1837,"We have pursued, through various lands, a long                    10"
3726,MAY 25TH 1837,"And pleasant course; flower after flower has blown,"
3727,MAY 25TH 1837,Embellishing the ground that gave them birth
3728,MAY 25TH 1837,With aspects novel to my sight; but still
3729,MAY 25TH 1837,"Most fair, most welcome, when they drank the dew"
3730,MAY 25TH 1837,"In a sweet fellowship with kinds beloved,                         15"
3731,MAY 25TH 1837,For old remembrance sake. And oft--where Spring
3732,MAY 25TH 1837,Display’d her richest blossoms among files
3733,MAY 25TH 1837,Of orange-trees bedecked with glowing fruit
3734,MAY 25TH 1837,"Ripe for the hand, or under a thick shade"
3735,MAY 25TH 1837,"Of Ilex, or, if better suited to the hour,                        20"
3736,MAY 25TH 1837,The lightsome Olive’s twinkling canopy--[133]
3737,MAY 25TH 1837,Oft have I heard the Nightingale and Thrush
3738,MAY 25TH 1837,Blending as in a common English grove
3739,MAY 25TH 1837,"Their love-songs; but, where’er my feet might roam,"
3740,MAY 25TH 1837,"Whate’er assemblages of new and old,                              25"
3741,MAY 25TH 1837,"Strange and familiar, might beguile the way,"
3742,MAY 25TH 1837,A gratulation from that vagrant Voice
3743,MAY 25TH 1837,Was wanting;--and most happily till now.
3744,MAY 25TH 1837,
3745,MAY 25TH 1837,"For see, Laverna! mark the far-famed Pile,"
3746,MAY 25TH 1837,"High on the brink of that precipitous rock,[134]                  30"
3747,MAY 25TH 1837,"Implanted like a Fortress, as in truth"
3748,MAY 25TH 1837,"It is, a Christian Fortress, garrisoned"
3749,MAY 25TH 1837,"In faith and hope, and dutiful obedience,"
3750,MAY 25TH 1837,"By a few Monks, a stern society,"
3751,MAY 25TH 1837,Dead to the world and scorning earth-born joys.                   35
3752,MAY 25TH 1837,"Nay--though the hopes that drew, the fears that drove,"
3753,MAY 25TH 1837,"St. Francis, far from Man’s resort, to abide"
3754,MAY 25TH 1837,"Among these sterile heights of Apennine, [135]"
3755,MAY 25TH 1837,"Bound him, nor, since he raised yon House, have ceased"

3761,MAY 25TH 1837,"Doth sometimes here predominate, and works                        45"
3762,MAY 25TH 1837,By unsought means for gracious purposes;

3834,MAY 25TH 1837,[130] Laverna is a corruption of _Alverna_ (now called Alverniac). It
3835,MAY 25TH 1837,"is about five or six hours’ walk from Camaldoli, on a height of the"
3836,MAY 25TH 1837,"Apennines, not far from the sources of the Anio. To reach it, “the"
3837,MAY 25TH 1837,southern height of the Monte Valterona is ascended as far as the chapel
3838,MAY 25TH 1837,"of St. Romaiald; then a descent is made to Moggiona, beyond which the"
3839,MAY 25TH 1837,"path turns to the left, traversing a long and fatiguing succession of"
3840,MAY 25TH 1837,gorges and slopes; the path at the base of the mountain is therefore
3841,MAY 25TH 1837,preferable. The market town of Soci in the valley of the Archiano
3842,MAY 25TH 1837,"is first reached, then the profound valley of the Corsaline; beyond"
3843,MAY 25TH 1837,"it rises a blunted cone, on which the path ascends in windings to a"
3844,MAY 25TH 1837,stony plain with marshy meadows. Above this rises the abrupt sandstone
3845,MAY 25TH 1837,"mass of the _Vernia_, to the height of 850 feet. On its S.W. slope,"
3846,MAY 25TH 1837,"one-third of the way up, and 3906 feet above the sea-level, is seen a"
3847,MAY 25TH 1837,"wall with small windows, the oldest part of the monastery, built in"
3848,MAY 25TH 1837,1218 by St. Francis of Assisi. The church dates from 1284.… One of the
3849,MAY 25TH 1837,"grandest points is the _Penna della Vernia_ (4796 feet), the ridge of"
3850,MAY 25TH 1837,"the Vernia, also known as _l’Apennino_, the ‘rugged rock between the"
3851,MAY 25TH 1837,"sources of the Tiber and Anio,’ as it is called by Dante (_Paradiso_,"
3852,MAY 25TH 1837,"ii. 106).… Near the monastery are the _Luoghi Santi_, a number of"
3853,MAY 25TH 1837,grottos and rock-hewn chambers in which St. Francis once lived.” (See

3916,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,This famous sanctuary was the original establishment of Saint Romualdo
3917,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,"(or Rumwald, as our ancestors saxonised the name) in the 11th century,"
3918,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,"the ground (campo) being given by a Count Maldo. The Camaldolensi,"
3919,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,"however, have spread wide as a branch of Benedictines, and may"
3920,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,therefore be classed among the _gentlemen_ of the monastic orders. The
3921,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,"society comprehends two orders, monks and hermits; symbolised by their"
3922,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,"arms, two doves drinking out of the same cup. The monastery in which"
3923,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,"the monks here reside is beautifully situated, but a large unattractive"
3924,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,"edifice, not unlike a factory. The hermitage is placed in a loftier and"
3925,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,wilder region of the forest. It comprehends between 20 and 30 distinct
3926,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,"residences, each including for its single hermit an inclosed piece of"
3927,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,ground and three very small apartments. There are days of indulgence
3928,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,"when the hermit may quit his cell, and when old age arrives, he"

3933,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,hermits. It is from him that I received the following[138] particulars.
3934,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,"He was then about 40 years of age, but his appearance was that of an"
3935,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,"older man. He had been a painter by profession, but on taking orders"
3936,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,"changed his name from Santi to Raffaello, perhaps with an unconscious"
3937,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,reference as well to the great Sanzio d’Urbino as to the archangel.
3938,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,He assured my friend that he had been 13 years in the hermitage and
3939,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,had never known melancholy or ennui. In the little recess for study
3940,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,"and prayer, there was a small collection of books. “I read only,” said"
3941,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,"he, “books of asceticism and mystical theology.” On being asked the"
3942,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,"names of the most famous[139] mystics, he enumerated _Scaramelli_, _San"
3943,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,"Giovanni della Croce_, _St. Dionysius the Areopagite_ (supposing the"
3944,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,"work which bears his name to be really his),[140] and with peculiar"
3945,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,emphasis _Ricardo di San Vittori_. The works of _Saint Theresa_ are
3946,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,also in high repute among ascetics.[141] These names may interest some
3947,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,of my readers.
3948,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,
3949,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,We heard that Raffaello was then living in the convent; my friend
3950,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,sought in vain to renew his acquaintance with him. It was probably a
3951,AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI,day of seclusion. The reader will perceive that these sonnets were

4060,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],"[I must confess, though of course I did not acknowledge it in the few"
4061,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],"lines I wrote in the Strangers’ book kept at the convent, that I was"
4062,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],"somewhat disappointed at Vallombrosa. I had expected, as the name"
4063,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],"implies, a deep and narrow valley overshadowed by enclosing hills; but"
4064,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],"the spot where the convent stands is in fact not a valley at all, but"
4065,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],a cove or crescent open to an extensive prospect. In the book before
4066,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],"mentioned, I read the notice in the English language that if anyone"
4067,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],"would ascend the steep ground above the convent, and wander over it, he"
4068,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],would be abundantly rewarded by magnificent views. I had not time to
4069,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],"act upon this recommendation, and only went with my young guide to a"
4070,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],"point, nearly on a level with the site of the convent, that overlooks"
4071,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],the Vale of Arno for some leagues. To praise great and good men has
4072,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],"ever been deemed one of the worthiest employments of poetry, but the"
4073,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],"objects of admiration vary so much with time and circumstances, and"
4074,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],"the noblest of mankind have been found, when intimately known, to be"
4075,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],"of characters so imperfect, that no eulogist can find a subject which"
4076,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],"he will venture upon with the animation necessary to create sympathy,"
4077,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],unless he confines himself to a particular part or he takes something
4078,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],of a one-sided view of the person he is disposed to celebrate. This
4079,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],"is a melancholy truth, and affords a strong reason for the poetic"
4080,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],mind being chiefly exercised in works of fiction: the poet can then
4081,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],"follow wherever the spirit of admiration leads him, unchecked by such"
4082,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],suggestions as will be too apt to cross his way if all that he is
4083,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],prompted to utter is to be tested by fact. Something in this spirit I
4084,AT VALLOMBROSA[145],have written in the note attached to the Sonnet on the King of Sweden;

4143,PARADISE LOST.[146],"from me, pointed out his residence, I shall not readily forget. It may"
4144,PARADISE LOST.[146],be proper here to defend the Poet from a charge which has been brought
4145,PARADISE LOST.[146],"against him, in respect to the passage in _Paradise Lost_, where this"
4146,PARADISE LOST.[146],"place is mentioned. It is said, that he has erred in speaking of the"
4147,PARADISE LOST.[146],"trees there being deciduous, whereas they are, in fact, pines. The"
4148,PARADISE LOST.[146],fault-finders are themselves mistaken; the _natural_ woods of the
4149,PARADISE LOST.[146],"region of Vallombrosa _are_ deciduous, and spread to a great extent;"
4150,PARADISE LOST.[146],"those near the convent are, indeed, mostly pines; but they are avenues"

5811,POOR ROBIN[214],that could possibly be seen. Defend us from the tyranny of trimness and
5812,POOR ROBIN[214],neatness showing itself in this way! Chatterton says of freedom--“Upon
5813,POOR ROBIN[214],"her head wild weeds were spread,” and depend upon it if “the marvellous"

5815,POOR ROBIN[214],what we are apt to call weeds to garden flowers. True taste has an eye
5816,POOR ROBIN[214],for both. Weeds have been called flowers out of place. I fear the place
5817,POOR ROBIN[214],most people would assign to them is too limited. Let them come near to

6196,FLOATING ISLAND,
6197,D. W.,D. W.
6198,D. W.,
6199,D. W.,"There is one of these floating islands in Loch Lomond in Argyll,"
6200,D. W.,"another in Loch Dochart in Perthshire, and another in Loch Treig"
6201,D. W.,in Inverness. Their origin is probably due to a mass of peat being
6202,D. W.,"detached from the shore, and floated out into the lake. A mass of"
6203,D. W.,"vegetable matter, however, has sometimes risen from the bottom of the"
6204,D. W.,"water, and assumed for a time all the appearance of an island. This"
6205,D. W.,"has been probably due to an accumulation of gas, within or under the"
6206,D. W.,"detached portion, produced by the decay of vegetation in extremely hot"
6207,D. W.,weather.
6208,D. W.,
6209,D. W.,"Southey, in an unpublished letter to Sir George Beaumont (10th July"
6210,D. W.,"1824), thus describes the Island at Derwentwater: “You will have seen"
6211,D. W.,by the papers that the Floating Island has made its appearance. It
6212,D. W.,"sank again last week, when some heavy rains had raised the lake four"
6213,D. W.,"feet. By good fortune Professor Sedgewick happened to be in Keswick,"
6214,D. W.,and examined it in time. Where he probed it a thin layer of mud lies
6215,D. W.,"upon a bed of peat, which is six feet thick, and this rests upon a"
6216,D. W.,"stratum of fine white clay,--the same I believe which Miss Barker"
6217,D. W.,found in Borrowdale when building her unlucky house. Where the gas is
6218,D. W.,"generated remains yet to be discovered, but when the peat is filled"
6219,D. W.,"with this gas, it separates from the clay and becomes buoyant. There"
6220,D. W.,"must have been a considerable convulsion when this took place, for a"
6221,D. W.,"rent was made in the bottom of the lake, several feet in depth, and"
6222,D. W.,"not less than fifty yards long, on each side of which the bottom rose"
6223,D. W.,and floated. It was a pretty sight to see the small fry exploring this
6224,D. W.,new made strait and darting at the bubbles which rose as the Professor
6225,D. W.,"was probing the bank. The discharge of air was considerable here, when"
6226,D. W.,a pole was thrust down. But at some distance where the rent did not
6227,D. W.,"extend, the bottom had been heaved up in a slight convexity, sloping"
6228,D. W.,"equally in an inclined plane all round: and there, when the pole was"
6229,D. W.,"introduced, a rush like a jet followed, as it was withdrawn. The thing"
6230,D. W.,"is the more curious, because as yet no example of it is known to have"
6231,D. W.,been observed in any other place.”
6232,D. W.,
6233,D. W.,Another of these detached islands used to float about in Esthwaite
6234,D. W.,"Water, and was carried from side to side of the pool at the north end"
6235,D. W.,"of the lake--the same pool which the swans, described in _The Prelude_,"
6236,D. W.,used to frequent. This island had a few bushes on it: but it became
6237,D. W.,stranded some time ago. One of the old natives of Hawkeshead described
6238,D. W.,"the process of trying to float it off again, by tying ropes to the"
6239,D. W.,"bushes on its surface,--an experiment which was unsuccessful. Compare"
6240,D. W.,"the reference to the Floating or “Buoyant” Island of Derwentwater, and"
6241,D. W.,"to the “mossy islet” of Esthwaite, in Wordsworth’s _Guide through the"
6242,D. W.,District of the Lakes_.--ED.

7591,"MY DEAR MR. JUSTICE COLERIDGE,",
7592,"MY DEAR MR. JUSTICE COLERIDGE,",The first line would certainly have more spirit by reading
7593,"MY DEAR MR. JUSTICE COLERIDGE,",“your” as you suggest. I had previously considered _that_;
7594,"MY DEAR MR. JUSTICE COLERIDGE,","but decided in favour of “the,” as “your,” I thought, would"
7595,"MY DEAR MR. JUSTICE COLERIDGE,","clog the sentence in sound, there being “ye” thrice repeated,"
7596,"MY DEAR MR. JUSTICE COLERIDGE,",and followed by “_you_” at the close of the 4th line. I also

7805,C.,[276] The following account of the circumstance which gave rise to the
7806,C.,"preceding poem is from the _Memoir_ of Professor Archer Butler, by Mr."
7807,C.,"Woodward, prefixed to the “First Series” of his Sermons. The late Rev."
7808,C.,"Archdeacon Graves, of Dublin (in 1849 of Windermere), in writing to Mr."
7809,C.,"Woodward, gives an interesting account of a walk, in July 1844, from"
7810,C.,"Windermere, by Rydal and Grasmere, to Loughrigg Tarn, etc., in which"
7811,C.,"Butler was accompanied by Wordsworth, Julius Charles Hare, Sir William"
7812,C.,"Hamilton, etc. He says, “The day was additionally memorable as giving"
7813,C.,birth to an interesting minor poem of Mr. Wordsworth’s. When we reached
7814,C.,the side of Loughrigg Tarn (which you may remember he notes for its
7815,C.,"similarity, in the peculiar character of its beauty, to the Lago di"
7816,C.,"Nemi--Dianae Speculum), the loveliness of the scene arrested our steps"
7817,C.,and fixed our gaze. The splendour of a July noon surrounded us and
7818,C.,"lit up the landscape, with the Langdale Pikes soaring above, and the"
7819,C.,bright tarn shining beneath; and when the poet’s eyes were satisfied
7820,C.,"with their feast on the beauties familiar to them, they sought relief"
7821,C.,"in the search, to them a happy vital habit, for new beauty in the"
7822,C.,flower-enamelled turf at his feet. There his attention was arrested
7823,C.,"by a fair smooth stone, of the size of an ostrich’s egg, seeming to"
7824,C.,"imbed at its centre, and at the same time to display a dark star-shaped"
7825,C.,fossil of most distinct outline. Upon closer inspection this proved
7826,C.,to be the shadow of a daisy projected upon it with extraordinary
7827,C.,precision by the intense light of an almost vertical sun. The poet drew
7828,C.,the attention of the rest of the party to the minute but beautiful
7829,C.,"phenomenon, and gave expression at the time to thoughts suggested by"
7830,C.,"it, which so interested our friend Professor Butler, that he plucked"
7831,C.,"the tiny flower, and, saying that “it should be not only the theme but"
7832,C.,"the memorial of the thought they had heard,” bestowed it somewhere"
7833,C.,"carefully for preservation. The little poem, in which some of these"
7834,C.,"thoughts were afterwards crystallised, commences with the stanza--"
7835,C.,
7836,C.,"So fair, so sweet, withal so sensitive,"
7837,C.,"Would that the little flowers were born to live,"
7838,C.,Conscious of half the pleasure that they give.”

8038,MS.,[285] These two rocks rise to the left of the lower high-road from
8039,MS.,"Grasmere to Rydal, after it leaves the former lake and turns eastwards"
8040,MS.,"towards the latter. They are still “heath-clad,” and covered with the"
8041,MS.,"coppice of the old Bane Riggs Wood, so named because the shortest"
8042,MS.,road from Ambleside to Grasmere used to pass through it; “bain” or
8043,MS.,"“bane” signifying, in the Westmoreland dialect, a short cut. Dr."
8044,MS.,"Cradock wrote of them thus:--“They are now difficult of approach,"
8045,MS.,"being enclosed in a wood, with dense undergrowth, and surrounded by"
8046,MS.,"a high, well-built wall. They can be well seen from the lower road,"
8047,MS.,from a spot close to the three-mile stone from Ambleside. They are
8048,MS.,"some fifty or sixty feet above the road, about twenty yards apart, and"
8049,MS.,"separated by a slight depression of, say, ten feet. The view from the"
8050,MS.,"easterly one is now much preferable, as it is less encumbered with"
8051,MS.,shrubs; and for that reason also is more heath-clad. The twin rocks
8052,MS.,"are also well seen, though at a farther distance, from the hill in"
8053,MS.,"White Moss Common between the roads, which Dr. Arnold used to call ‘Old"
8054,MS.,"Corruption,’ and ‘Bit-by-bit Reform.’ Doubtless the rocks were far more"
8055,MS.,"easily approached fifty years ago, when walls, if any, were low and"
8056,MS.,"ill-built. It is probable, however, that even then they were enclosed"
8057,MS.,"and protected; for heath will not grow on the Grasmere hills, on places"
8058,MS.,much frequented by sheep.” The best view of these “heath-clad” rocks
8059,MS.,from the lower carriage road is at a spot two or three yards to the
8060,MS.,west of a large rock on the road-side near the milestone. The view
8061,MS.,of them from the Loughrigg Terrace walks is also interesting. The
8062,MS.,two sisters were Mary and Sarah Hutchinson (Mrs. Wordsworth and her
8063,MS.,"Sister); and, in the Rydal household, the rocks were respectively named"
8064,MS.,"“Mary-Point,” and “Sarah-Point.”--ED."

8217,PART II,"Should the country need a heroine,"

8233,PART II,"of the soil,” and have been parish clerks in Grasmere for generations."
8234,PART II,One of them was the tenant of the Swan Inn referred to in _The

8806,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,at least passed between the writing of the four first stanzas and
8807,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,the remaining part. To the attentive and competent reader the whole
8808,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,sufficiently explains itself; but there may be no harm in adverting
8809,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,here to particular feelings or _experiences_ of my own mind on which
8810,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,the structure of the poem partly rests. Nothing was more difficult for
8811,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,me in childhood than to admit the notion of death as a state applicable
8812,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,to my own being. I have said elsewhere--
8813,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,
8814,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"A simple child,"
8815,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"That lightly draws its breath,"
8816,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"And feels its life in every limb,"
8817,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,What should it know of death!--
8818,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,
8819,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,But it was not so much from feelings of animal vivacity that my
8820,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,difficulty came as from a sense of the indomitableness of the Spirit
8821,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"within me. I used to brood over the stories of Enoch and Elijah, and"
8822,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"almost to persuade myself that, whatever might become of others, I"
8823,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"should be translated, in something of the same way, to heaven. With"
8824,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"a feeling congenial to this, I was often unable to think of external"
8825,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"things as having external existence, and I communed with all that I saw"
8826,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"as something not apart from, but inherent in, my own immaterial nature."
8827,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Many times while going to school have I grasped at a wall or tree to
8828,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,recall myself from this abyss of idealism to the reality. At that
8829,INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,time I was afraid of such processes. In later periods of life I have

9098,XI,
9099,XI,This great _Ode_ was first printed as the last poem in the second
9100,XI,volume of the edition of 1807. At that date Wordsworth gave it the
9101,XI,"simple title _Ode_, prefixing to it the motto, “Paulò majora canamus.”"
9102,XI,"In 1815, when he revised the poem throughout, he named it--in"
9103,XI,the characteristic manner of many of his titles--diffuse and yet
9104,XI,"precise, _Ode. Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early"
9105,XI,Childhood_; and he then prefixed to it the lines of his own earlier
9106,XI,poem on the Rainbow (March 1802):--
9107,XI,
9108,XI,The Child is Father of the Man;
9109,XI,And I could wish my days to be
9110,XI,Bound each to each by natural piety.
9111,XI,
9112,XI,It retained this longer title and motto in all subsequent editions. In
9113,XI,"the editions 1807 to 1820, it was placed by itself at the end of the"
9114,XI,"poems, and formed their natural conclusion and climax. In the editions"
9115,XI,"1827 and 1832, it was inappropriately put amongst “Epitaphs and Elegiac"
9116,XI,Poems.” The evident mistake of placing it amongst these seems to have
9117,XI,"suggested to Wordsworth, in 1836, its having a place by itself,--which"
9118,XI,he gave it then and retained in the subsequent editions of 1842 and
9119,XI,"1849,--when it closed the series of minor poems in Volume V., and"
9120,XI,preceded the _Excursion_ in Volume VI. The same arrangement was adopted
9121,XI,in the double-columned single volume edition of 1845.
9122,XI,
9123,XI,Mr. Aubrey de Vere has urged me to take it out of its chronological
9124,XI,"place, and let it conclude the whole series of Wordsworth’s poems, as"
9125,XI,"the greatest, and that to which all others lead up. Mr. De Vere’s wish"
9126,XI,is based on conversations which he had with the poet himself.
9127,XI,
9128,XI,"The _Ode, Intimations of Immortality_, was written at intervals,"
9129,XI,between the years 1803 and 1806; and it was subjected to frequent and
9130,XI,careful revision. No poem of Wordsworth’s bears more evident traces
9131,XI,in its structure at once of inspiration and elaboration; of original
9132,XI,"flight of thought and _afflatus_ on the one hand, and on the other of"
9133,XI,careful sculpture and fastidious choice of phrase. But it is remarkable
9134,XI,that there are very few changes of text in the successive editions.
9135,XI,"Most of the alterations were made before 1815, and the omission of some"
9136,XI,feeble lines which originally stood in stanza viii. in the editions
9137,XI,"of 1807 and 1815, was a great advantage in disencumbering the poem."
9138,XI,"The main revision and elaboration of this Ode, however--an elaboration"
9139,XI,which suggests the passage of the glacier ice over the rocks of White
9140,XI,"Moss Common, where the poem was murmured out stanza by stanza--was all"
9141,XI,finished before it first saw the light in 1807. In form it is irregular
9142,XI,"and original. And perhaps the most remarkable thing in its structure,"
9143,XI,"is the frequent change of the keynote, and the skill and delicacy with"
9144,XI,which the transitions are made. “The feet throughout are iambic. The
9145,XI,lines vary in length from the Alexandrine to the line with two accents.
9146,XI,"There is a constant ebb and flow in the full tide of song, but scarce"
9147,XI,"two waves are alike.” (Hawes Turner, _Selections from Wordsworth_.)"
9148,XI,
9149,XI,"In the “notes” to the _Selections_ just referred to on Immortality,"
9150,XI,"there is an excellent commentary on this _Ode_, almost every line of"
9151,XI,which is worthy of minute analysis and study. Some of the following are
9152,XI,suggested by Mr. Turner’s notes.
9153,XI,
9154,XI,(1) _The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep._
9155,XI,
9156,XI,The morning breeze blowing from the fields that were dark during the
9157,XI,hours of sleep.
9158,XI,
9159,XI,"(2) --_But there’s a Tree, of many, one._"
9160,XI,
9161,XI,Compare Browning’s _May and Death_--
9162,XI,
9163,XI,"Only one little sight, one plant"
9164,XI,"Woods have in May, etc."
9165,XI,
9166,XI,(3) _The Pansy at my feet_
9167,XI,_Doth the same tale repeat._
9168,XI,
9169,XI,"French “Pensée.” “Pansies, that’s for thoughts.” Ophelia in _Hamlet_."
9170,XI,
9171,XI,(4) _Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting._
9172,XI,
9173,XI,"This thought Wordsworth owed, consciously or unconsciously, to Plato."
9174,XI,Though he tells us in the Fenwick note that he did not mean to
9175,XI,"_inculcate_ the belief, there is no doubt that he clung to the notion"
9176,XI,"of a life pre-existing the present, on grounds similar to those on"
9177,XI,which he believed in a life to come. But there are some differences in
9178,XI,the way in which the idea commended itself to Plato and to Wordsworth.
9179,XI,The stress was laid by Wordsworth on the effect of terrestrial life
9180,XI,"in putting the higher faculties to sleep, and making us “forget the"
9181,XI,"glories we have known.” Plato, on the other hand, looked upon the"
9182,XI,mingled experiences of mundane life as inducing a gradual but slow
9183,XI,"remembrance (ἀνάμνεσις) of the past. Compare Tennyson’s _Two Voices_,"
9184,XI,"and Wordsworth’s sonnet, beginning--"
9185,XI,
9186,XI,"Man’s life is like a sparrow, mighty king."
9187,XI,
9188,XI,(5) _Filling from time to time his “humorous stage”_
9189,XI,"_With all the Persons,_"
9190,XI,
9191,XI,_i.e._ with the _dramatis personæ_.
9192,XI,
9193,XI,"(6) … _thou Eye among the blind,_"
9194,XI,"_That, deaf and silent, read’st the eternal deep._"
9195,XI,
9196,XI,There is an admirable parallel illustration of Wordsworth’s use of this
9197,XI,"figure (describing one sense in terms of another), in the lines in"
9198,XI,_Airey-Force Valley_--
9199,XI,
9200,XI,A soft eye-music of slow-waving boughs.
9201,XI,
9202,XI,"(7) _Full soon thy Soul shall have her earthly freight,_"
9203,XI,"_And custom lie upon thee with a weight,_"
9204,XI,"_Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!_"
9205,XI,
9206,XI,"Compare with this, the lines in the fourth book of _The Excursion_,"
9207,XI,beginning--
9208,XI,
9209,XI,Alas! the endowment of immortal power
9210,XI,"Is matched unequally with custom, time."
9211,XI,
9212,XI,"(8) _Fallings from us, vanishings._"
9213,XI,
9214,XI,"The outward sensible universe, visible and tangible, seeming to"
9215,XI,"fall away from us, as unreal, to vanish in unsubstantially. See the"
9216,XI,explanation of this youthful experience in the Fenwick note. That
9217,XI,"confession of his boyish days at Hawkshead, “many times, while going to"
9218,XI,"school, have I grasped at a wall or tree, _to recall myself from this"
9219,XI,abyss of idealism to the reality_” (by which he explains those--
9220,XI,
9221,XI,"Fallings from us, vanishings, etc.),"
9222,XI,
9223,XI,suggests a similar experience and confession of Cardinal Newman’s in
9224,XI,his _Apologia_ (see p. 67).
9225,XI,
9226,XI,"The late Rev. Robert Perceval Graves, of Windermere, and afterwards of"
9227,XI,"Dublin, wrote to me in 1850:--“I remember Mr. Wordsworth saying, that"
9228,XI,"at a particular stage of his mental progress, he used to be frequently"
9229,XI,so rapt into an unreal transcendental world of ideas that the external
9230,XI,"world seemed no longer to exist in relation to him, and he _had to"
9231,XI,"reconvince himself of its existence by clasping a tree, or something"
9232,XI,that happened to be near him_. I could not help connecting this fact
9233,XI,with that obscure passage in his great _Ode on the Intimations of
9234,XI,"Immortality_, in which he speaks of--"
9235,XI,
9236,XI,Those obstinate questionings
9237,XI,Of sense and outward things;
9238,XI,"Fallings from us, vanishings; etc.”"
9239,XI,
9240,XI,Professor Bonamy Price further confirms the explanation which
9241,XI,"Wordsworth gave of the passage, in a letter written to me in 1881,"
9242,XI,"giving an account of a conversation he had with the poet, as follows:--"
9243,XI,
9244,XI,"“OXFORD, _April 21, 1881_."
9245,XI,
9246,XI,"“MY DEAR SIR,--You will be glad, I am sure, to receive an"
9247,XI,"interpretation, which chance enabled me to obtain from"
9248,XI,Wordsworth himself of a passage in the immortal _Ode on
9249,XI,Immortality_.…
9250,XI,
9251,XI,"“It happened one day that the poet, my wife, and I were taking"
9252,XI,a walk together by the side of Rydal Water. We were then by the
9253,XI,sycamores under Nab Scar. The aged poet was in a most genial
9254,XI,"mood, and it suddenly occurred to me that I might, without"
9255,XI,"unwarrantable presumption, seize the golden opportunity thus"
9256,XI,"offered, and ask him to explain these mysterious words. So"
9257,XI,"I addressed him with an apology, and begged him to explain,"
9258,XI,"what my own feeble mother-wit was unable to unravel, and for"
9259,XI,"which I had in vain sought the assistance of others, what"
9260,XI,"were those ‘fallings from us, vanishings,’ for which, above"
9261,XI,"all other things, he gave God thanks. The venerable old man"
9262,XI,"raised his aged form erect; he was walking in the middle,"
9263,XI,and passed across me to a five-barred gate in the wall which
9264,XI,bounded the road on the side of the lake. He clenched the top
9265,XI,"bar firmly with his right hand, pushed strongly against it,"
9266,XI,and then uttered these ever-memorable words: ‘There was a time
9267,XI,"in my life when I had to push against something that resisted,"
9268,XI,to be sure that there was anything outside of me. I was sure
9269,XI,"of my own mind; everything else fell away, and vanished into"
9270,XI,"thought.’ Thought, he was sure of; matter for him, at the"
9271,XI,"moment, was an unreality--nothing but a thought. Such natural"
9272,XI,spontaneous idealism has probably never been felt by any other
9273,XI,man.

9278,“BONAMY PRICE.”,Professor Price imagined--and its value would be much lessened if it
9279,“BONAMY PRICE.”,had been so--but was one to which (as the poet said to Miss Fenwick)

9285,“BONAMY PRICE.”,“To the _Ode on the Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of

9670,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,
9671,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,[337] The only justification for republishing this sonnet is that it is
9672,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,the earliest authoritative record of Wordsworth’s attempts in Verse. It
9673,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,is a much more authentic one than the _Extract from the conclusion of
9674,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,"a Poem, composed in anticipation of leaving School_, or than the lines"
9675,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,"_Written in very early Youth_, and beginning"
9676,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,
9677,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,Calm is all nature as a resting wheel.
9678,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,
9679,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,"Wordsworth dated the former of these poems 1786, but I do not believe"
9680,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,"that he wrote that poem, and still less that he wrote “Calm is all"
9681,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,"nature,” etc., _as we now have it_, in that year. Doubtless he wrote"
9682,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,verses on these two subjects; but the best evidence against the notion
9683,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,"that the text, as we now have it, was written in 1786, is this 1787"
9684,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,"sonnet on Miss Maria Williams. It is not only dated authoritatively,"
9685,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,but it was _published_ in 1787; and therefore serves (as nothing else
9686,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,can until we come to 1793) as evidence in regard to the development of
9687,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,his poetic power. The translation of Francis Wrangham’s lines--which
9688,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,"he called _The Birth of Love_--in 1795, is further evidence in the"
9689,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,same direction. No doubt there were many poor poetic utterances by
9690,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,"Wordsworth later in life--failures in his manhood, as dismal as the"
9691,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,“Walford Tragedy” was in his youth--but I think that the _Lines written
9692,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,"in very early Youth_, and the _Extract from the Poem composed in"
9693,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,"anticipation of leaving School_, were rehandled by him, and the text"
9694,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,greatly improved before they were first published. The late Mr. J.
9695,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,Dykes Campbell wrote to me in 1892: “Poets tell dreadful fibs about
9696,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,their early verses--as witness S.T.C. who declared he wrote _The Advent
9697,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,"of Love_ at fifteen! I _know_ he didn’t, and am going to print one or"
9698,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,"two of his prize school verses of that age, which I have found in his"

9703,AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM,have reached him from an authentic one.--ED.

10114,ANDREW JONES,I wish the press-gang or the drum

10123,ANDREW JONES,For this poor crawling helpless wretch
10124,ANDREW JONES,"Some horseman who was passing by,[342]"
10125,ANDREW JONES,A penny on the ground had thrown;

10128,ANDREW JONES,
10129,ANDREW JONES,Inch-thick the dust lay on the ground
10130,ANDREW JONES,For it had long been droughty weather;
10131,ANDREW JONES,So with his staff the cripple wrought
10132,ANDREW JONES,Among the dust till he had brought
10133,ANDREW JONES,The half-pennies together.                                        20

10137,ANDREW JONES,The cripple in the mid-day heat
10138,ANDREW JONES,"Standing alone, and at his feet"
10139,ANDREW JONES,He saw the penny on the ground.                                   25
10140,ANDREW JONES,
10141,ANDREW JONES,He stooped and took the penny up:[343]

10143,ANDREW JONES,"Quoth Andrew, “Under half-a-crown,"
10144,ANDREW JONES,"What a man finds is all his own,"

10391,“THERE IS A SHAPELESS CROWD OF UNHEWN STONES”,"The sheep sprang forward to the further shore,"
10392,“THERE IS A SHAPELESS CROWD OF UNHEWN STONES”,And was borne headlong by the roaring flood.

10893,HOME AT GRASMERE,But most of all the Birds that haunt the flood
10894,HOME AT GRASMERE,With the mild summons; inmates though they be
10895,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of winter’s household, they keep festival                        195"
10896,HOME AT GRASMERE,"This day, who drooped, or seemed to droop, so long;"
10897,HOME AT GRASMERE,"They shew their pleasure, and shall I do less?"
10898,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Happiest of happy though I be, like them"
10899,HOME AT GRASMERE,"I cannot take possession of the sky,"
10900,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Mount with a thoughtless impulse, and wheel there,               200"
10901,HOME AT GRASMERE,"One of a mighty multitude, whose way"
10902,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Is a perpetual harmony, and dance"
10903,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Magnificent. Behold, how with a grace"
10904,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of ceaseless motion,[362] that might scarcely seem"
10905,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Inferior to angelical, they prolong                              205"
10906,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Their curious pastime, shaping in mid air,"
10907,HOME AT GRASMERE,And sometimes with ambitious wing that soars
10908,HOME AT GRASMERE,"High as the level of the mountain tops,"
10909,HOME AT GRASMERE,"A circuit ampler than the lake beneath,"
10910,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Their own domain;--but ever, while intent                        210"
10911,HOME AT GRASMERE,"On tracing and retracing that large round,"
10912,HOME AT GRASMERE,Their jubilant activity evolves
10913,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Hundreds of curves and circlets, to and fro,"
10914,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Upwards and downwards, progress intricate"
10915,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Yet unperplexed, as if one spirit swayed                         215"
10916,HOME AT GRASMERE,Their indefatigable flight. ’Tis done--
10917,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Ten times and more, I fancied it had ceased;"
10918,HOME AT GRASMERE,But lo! the vanished company again
10919,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Ascending, they approach--I hear their wings"
10920,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Faint, faint at first; and then an eager sound                   220"
10921,HOME AT GRASMERE,Passed in a moment--and as faint again!
10922,HOME AT GRASMERE,They tempt the sun to sport among[363] their plumes;
10923,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Tempt the smooth water,[364] or the gleaming ice,"
10924,HOME AT GRASMERE,"To show them a fair image; ’tis themselves,"
10925,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Their own fair forms, upon the glimmering plain,                 225"
10926,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Painted more soft and fair as they descend,"
10927,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Almost to touch;--then up again aloft,"
10928,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Up with a sally, and a flash of speed,"
10929,HOME AT GRASMERE,As if they scorned both resting-place and rest![365]
10930,HOME AT GRASMERE,"This day is a thanksgiving, ’tis a day                           230"
10931,HOME AT GRASMERE,Of glad emotion and deep quietness;
10932,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Not upon me alone hath been bestowed,"
10933,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Me rich in many onward-looking thoughts,"
10934,HOME AT GRASMERE,The penetrating bliss; oh surely these
10935,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Have felt it, not the happy Quires of Spring,                    235"
10936,HOME AT GRASMERE,Her own peculiar family of love
10937,HOME AT GRASMERE,"That sport among green leaves, a blither train."
10938,HOME AT GRASMERE,"But two are missing--two, a lonely pair"
10939,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of milk-white Swans, wherefore are _they_ not seen"
10940,HOME AT GRASMERE,Partaking this day’s pleasure? From afar                         240
10941,HOME AT GRASMERE,"They came, to sojourn here in solitude,"
10942,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Choosing this Valley, they who had the choice"
10943,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of the whole world.[366] We saw them day by day,"
10944,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Through these two months of unrelenting storm,"
10945,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Conspicuous at the centre of the Lake,                           245"
10946,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Their safe retreat. We knew them well, I guess"
10947,HOME AT GRASMERE,That the whole Valley knew them; but to us
10948,HOME AT GRASMERE,"They were more dear than may be well believed,"
10949,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Not only for their beauty, and their still"
10950,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And placid way of life, and constant love                        250"
10951,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Inseparable, not for these alone,"
10952,HOME AT GRASMERE,"But that _their_ state so much resembled ours,"
10953,HOME AT GRASMERE,They having also chosen this abode;
10954,HOME AT GRASMERE,"They strangers, and we strangers; they a pair,"
10955,HOME AT GRASMERE,And we a solitary pair like them.                                255
10956,HOME AT GRASMERE,They should not have departed; many days
10957,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Did I look forth in vain, nor on the wing"
10958,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Could see them, nor in that small open space"
10959,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of blue unfrozen water, where they lodged,"
10960,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And lived so long in quiet, side by side.                        260"
10961,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Shall we behold them, consecrated friends,"
10962,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Faithful companions, yet another year"
10963,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Surviving--they for us, and we for them--"
10964,HOME AT GRASMERE,And neither pair be broken? Nay perchance
10965,HOME AT GRASMERE,"It is too late already for such hope,                            265"
10966,HOME AT GRASMERE,"The Dalesmen may have aimed the deadly tube,"
10967,HOME AT GRASMERE,And parted them; or haply both are gone
10968,HOME AT GRASMERE,"One death, and that were mercy given to both."
10969,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Recal my song the ungenerous thought; forgive,"
10970,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Thrice favoured Region, the conjecture harsh                     270"
10971,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of such inhospitable penalty,"
10972,HOME AT GRASMERE,Inflicted upon confidence so pure.
10973,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Ah, if I wished to follow where the sight"
10974,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of all that is before mine eyes, the voice"
10975,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Which speaks from a presiding Spirit here,                       275"
10976,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Would lead me, I should whisper to myself;"
10977,HOME AT GRASMERE,They who are dwellers in this holy place
10978,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Must needs themselves be hallowed, they require"
10979,HOME AT GRASMERE,"No benediction from the stranger’s lips,"
10980,HOME AT GRASMERE,For they are blest already. None would give                      280
10981,HOME AT GRASMERE,"The greeting “peace be with you” unto them,"
10982,HOME AT GRASMERE,"For peace they have, it cannot but be theirs,"
10983,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And mercy, and forbearance. Nay--not these,"
10984,HOME AT GRASMERE,Their healing offices a pure goodwill
10985,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Precludes, and charity beyond the bounds                         285"
10986,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of charity--an overflowing love,"
10987,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Not for the creature only, but for all"
10988,HOME AT GRASMERE,"That is around them, love for every thing"
10989,HOME AT GRASMERE,Which in this happy region they behold!
10990,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Thus do we soothe ourselves, and when the thought              290"
10991,HOME AT GRASMERE,Is past we blame it not for having come.
10992,HOME AT GRASMERE,"What, if I floated down a pleasant Stream"
10993,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And now am landed, and the motion gone,"
10994,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Shall I reprove myself? Ah no, the stream"
10995,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Is flowing, and will never cease to flow,[367]                   295"
10996,HOME AT GRASMERE,And I shall float upon that stream again.
10997,HOME AT GRASMERE,"By such forgetfulness the soul becomes,"
10998,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Words cannot say, how beautiful. Then hail,"
10999,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Hail to the visible Presence, hail to thee,"
11000,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Delightful Valley, habitation fair!                              300"
11001,HOME AT GRASMERE,And to whatever else of outward form
11002,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Can give us inward help, can purify,"
11003,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And elevate, and harmonise, and soothe,"
11004,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And steal away, and for a while deceive"
11005,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And lap in pleasing rest, and bear us on                         305"
11006,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Without desire in full complacency,"
11007,HOME AT GRASMERE,Contemplating perfection absolute
11008,HOME AT GRASMERE,And entertained as in a placid sleep.
11009,HOME AT GRASMERE,But not betrayed by tenderness of mind
11010,HOME AT GRASMERE,"That feared, or wholly overlooked the truth,                     310"
11011,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Did we come hither, with romantic hope"
11012,HOME AT GRASMERE,"To find, in midst of so much loveliness,"
11013,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Love, perfect love; of so much majesty"
11014,HOME AT GRASMERE,A like majestic frame of mind in those
11015,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Who here abide, the persons like the place.                      315"
11016,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Not from such hope, or aught of such belief"
11017,HOME AT GRASMERE,Hath issued any portion of the joy
11018,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Which I have felt this day. An awful voice,"
11019,HOME AT GRASMERE,"’Tis true, hath in my walks been often heard,"
11020,HOME AT GRASMERE,Sent from the mountains or the sheltered fields;                 320
11021,HOME AT GRASMERE,Shout after shout--reiterated whoop
11022,HOME AT GRASMERE,In manner of a bird that takes delight
11023,HOME AT GRASMERE,In answering to itself; or like a hound
11024,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Single at chase among the lonely woods,"
11025,HOME AT GRASMERE,His yell repeating;[368] yet it was in truth                     325
11026,HOME AT GRASMERE,"A human voice--a Spirit of coming night,"
11027,HOME AT GRASMERE,"How solemn when the sky is dark, and earth"
11028,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Not dark, nor yet enlightened, but by snow"
11029,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Made visible, amid a noise of winds"
11030,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And bleatings manifold of mountain sheep,                        330"
11031,HOME AT GRASMERE,Which in that iteration recognise
11032,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Their summons, and are gathering round for food,"
11033,HOME AT GRASMERE,Devoured with keenness ere to grove or bank
11034,HOME AT GRASMERE,Or rocky _bield_ with patience they retire.
11035,HOME AT GRASMERE,"That very voice, which, in some timid mood                     335"
11036,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of superstitious fancy, might have seemed"
11037,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Awful as ever stray Demoniac uttered,"
11038,HOME AT GRASMERE,His steps to govern in the Wilderness;
11039,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Or as the Norman Curfew’s regular beat,"
11040,HOME AT GRASMERE,To hearths when first they darkened at the knell:                340
11041,HOME AT GRASMERE,"That Shepherd’s voice, it may have reached mine ear"
11042,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Debased and under profanation, made"
11043,HOME AT GRASMERE,The ready Organ of articulate sounds
11044,HOME AT GRASMERE,"From ribaldry, impiety, or wrath"
11045,HOME AT GRASMERE,Issuing when shame hath ceased to check the brawls               345
11046,HOME AT GRASMERE,Of some abused Festivity--so be it.
11047,HOME AT GRASMERE,"I came not dreaming of unruffled life,"
11048,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Untainted manners; born among the hills,"
11049,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Bred also there, I wanted not a scale"
11050,HOME AT GRASMERE,"To regulate my hopes. Pleased with the good,                     350"
11051,HOME AT GRASMERE,"I shrink not from the evil with disgust,"
11052,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Or with immoderate pain. I look for Man,"
11053,HOME AT GRASMERE,"The common creature of the brotherhood,"
11054,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Differing but little from the Man elsewhere,"
11055,HOME AT GRASMERE,"For selfishness, and envy, and revenge,                          355"
11056,HOME AT GRASMERE,Ill neighbourhood--pity that this should be--
11057,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Flattery and double-dealing, strife and wrong."
11058,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Yet is it something gained, it is in truth"
11059,HOME AT GRASMERE,"A mighty gain, that Labour here preserves"
11060,HOME AT GRASMERE,"His rosy face, a servant only here                               360"
11061,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of the fire-side, or of the open field,"
11062,HOME AT GRASMERE,"A freeman, therefore, sound and unimpaired;"
11063,HOME AT GRASMERE,"That extreme penury is here unknown,"
11064,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And cold and hunger’s abject wretchedness,"
11065,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Mortal to body, and the heaven-born mind;                        365"
11066,HOME AT GRASMERE,"That they who want, are not too great a weight"
11067,HOME AT GRASMERE,For those who can relieve. Here may the heart
11068,HOME AT GRASMERE,Breathe in the air of fellow-suffering
11069,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Dreadless, as in a kind of fresher breeze"
11070,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of her own native element, the hand                              370"
11071,HOME AT GRASMERE,Be ready and unwearied without plea
11072,HOME AT GRASMERE,"From tasks too frequent, or beyond its power"
11073,HOME AT GRASMERE,"For languor, or indifference, or despair."
11074,HOME AT GRASMERE,And as these lofty barriers break the force
11075,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of winds, this deep Vale,--as it doth in part                    375"
11076,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Conceal us from the storm,--so here abides"
11077,HOME AT GRASMERE,"A power and a protection for the mind,"
11078,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Dispensed indeed to other solitudes,"
11079,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Favoured by noble privilege like this,"
11080,HOME AT GRASMERE,Where kindred independence of estate                             380
11081,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Is prevalent, where he who tills the field,"
11082,HOME AT GRASMERE,"He, happy man! is master of the field,[369]"
11083,HOME AT GRASMERE,And treads the mountains which his fathers trod.
11084,HOME AT GRASMERE,Not less than half-way up yon Mountain’s side
11085,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Behold a dusky spot, a grove of Firs,                            385"
11086,HOME AT GRASMERE,That seems still smaller than it is. This grove
11087,HOME AT GRASMERE,Is haunted--by what ghost? a gentle spirit
11088,HOME AT GRASMERE,Of memory faithful to the call of love;
11089,HOME AT GRASMERE,"For, as reports the dame, whose fire sends up"
11090,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Yon curling smoke from the grey cot below,                       390"
11091,HOME AT GRASMERE,The trees (her first-born child being then a babe)
11092,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Were planted by her husband and herself,"
11093,HOME AT GRASMERE,That ranging o’er the high and houseless ground
11094,HOME AT GRASMERE,Their sheep might neither want (from perilous storms
11095,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of winter, nor from summer’s sultry heat)                        395"
11096,HOME AT GRASMERE,"A friendly covert. “And they knew it well,”"
11097,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Said she, “for thither as the trees grew up,"
11098,HOME AT GRASMERE,We to the patient creatures carried food
11099,HOME AT GRASMERE,In times of heavy snow.” She then began
11100,HOME AT GRASMERE,In fond obedience to her private thoughts                        400
11101,HOME AT GRASMERE,To speak of her dead husband. Is there not
11102,HOME AT GRASMERE,"An art, a music, and a strain of words"
11103,HOME AT GRASMERE,"That shall be like the acknowledged voice of life,"
11104,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Shall speak of what is done among the fields,"
11105,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Done truly there, or felt, of solid good                         405"
11106,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And real evil, yet be sweet withal,"
11107,HOME AT GRASMERE,"More grateful, more harmonious than the breath,"
11108,HOME AT GRASMERE,The idle breath of softest pipe attuned
11109,HOME AT GRASMERE,"To pastoral fancies? Is there such a stream,"
11110,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Pure and unsullied, flowing from the heart                       410"
11111,HOME AT GRASMERE,With motions of true dignity and grace?
11112,HOME AT GRASMERE,Or must we seek that stream where Man is not?
11113,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Methinks I could repeat in tuneful verse,"
11114,HOME AT GRASMERE,Delicious as the gentlest breeze that sounds
11115,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Through that aerial fir-grove, could preserve                    415"
11116,HOME AT GRASMERE,Some portion of its human history
11117,HOME AT GRASMERE,"As gathered from the Matron’s lips, and tell"
11118,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of tears that have been shed at sight of it,"
11119,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And moving dialogues between this pair,"
11120,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Who in their prime of wedlock, with joint hands                  420"
11121,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Did plant the grove, now flourishing, while they"
11122,HOME AT GRASMERE,"No longer flourish, he entirely gone,"
11123,HOME AT GRASMERE,She withering in her loneliness. Be this
11124,HOME AT GRASMERE,A task above my skill; the silent mind
11125,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Has her own treasures, and I think of these,                     425"
11126,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Love what I see, and honour humankind."
11127,HOME AT GRASMERE,"No, we are not alone, we do not stand,"
11128,HOME AT GRASMERE,"My Sister, here misplaced and desolate,"
11129,HOME AT GRASMERE,Loving what no one cares for but ourselves;
11130,HOME AT GRASMERE,We shall not scatter through the plains and rocks                430
11131,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of this fair Vale, and o’er its spacious heights"
11132,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Unprofitable kindliness, bestowed"
11133,HOME AT GRASMERE,On objects unaccustomed to the gifts
11134,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of feeling, which were cheerless and forlorn"
11135,HOME AT GRASMERE,"But few weeks past, and would be so again                        435"
11136,HOME AT GRASMERE,Were we not here; we do not tend a lamp
11137,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Whose lustre we alone participate,"
11138,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Which shines dependent upon us alone,"
11139,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Mortal though bright, a dying, dying flame."
11140,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Look where we will, some human hand has been                     440"
11141,HOME AT GRASMERE,Before us with its offering; not a tree
11142,HOME AT GRASMERE,Sprinkles these little pastures but the same
11143,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Hath furnished matter for a thought; perchance,"
11144,HOME AT GRASMERE,"For some one, serves as a familiar friend."
11145,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Joy spreads, and sorrow spreads; and this whole Vale,            445"
11146,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Home of untutored shepherds as it is,"
11147,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Swarms with sensation, as with gleams of sunshine,"
11148,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Shadows or breezes, scents or sounds. Nor deem"
11149,HOME AT GRASMERE,"These feelings, though subservient more than ours"
11150,HOME AT GRASMERE,"To every day’s demand for daily bread,                           450"
11151,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And borrowing more their spirit, and their shape"
11152,HOME AT GRASMERE,"From self-respecting interests, deem them not"
11153,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Unworthy therefore, and unhallowed: no,"
11154,HOME AT GRASMERE,"They lift the animal being, do themselves"
11155,HOME AT GRASMERE,By Nature’s kind and ever-present aid                            455
11156,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Refine the selfishness from which they spring,"
11157,HOME AT GRASMERE,Redeem by love the individual sense
11158,HOME AT GRASMERE,Of anxiousness with which they are combined.
11159,HOME AT GRASMERE,And thus it is that fitly they become
11160,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Associates in the joy of purest minds,                           460"
11161,HOME AT GRASMERE,"They blend therewith congenially: meanwhile,"
11162,HOME AT GRASMERE,Calmly they breathe their own undying life
11163,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Through this their mountain sanctuary. Long,"
11164,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Oh long may it remain inviolate,"
11165,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Diffusing health and sober cheerfulness,                         465"
11166,HOME AT GRASMERE,And giving to the moments as they pass
11167,HOME AT GRASMERE,Their little boons of animating thought
11168,HOME AT GRASMERE,"That sweeten labour, make it seen and felt"
11169,HOME AT GRASMERE,"To be no arbitrary weight imposed,"
11170,HOME AT GRASMERE,But a glad function natural to man.                              470
11171,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Fair proof of this, newcomer though I be,"
11172,HOME AT GRASMERE,Already have I gained. The inward frame
11173,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Though slowly opening, opens every day"
11174,HOME AT GRASMERE,With process not unlike to that which cheers
11175,HOME AT GRASMERE,"A pensive stranger, journeying at his leisure                    475"
11176,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Through some Helvetian dell, when low-hung mists"
11177,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Break up, and are beginning to recede;"
11178,HOME AT GRASMERE,How pleased he is where thin and thinner grows
11179,HOME AT GRASMERE,"The veil, or where it parts at once, to spy"
11180,HOME AT GRASMERE,The dark pines thrusting forth their spiky heads;                480
11181,HOME AT GRASMERE,"To watch the spreading lawns with cattle grazed,"
11182,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Then to be greeted by the scattered huts,"
11183,HOME AT GRASMERE,As they shine out; and _see_ the streams whose murmur
11184,HOME AT GRASMERE,Had soothed his ear while _they_ were hidden: how pleased
11185,HOME AT GRASMERE,"To have about him, which way e’er he goes,                       485"
11186,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Something on every side concealed from view,"
11187,HOME AT GRASMERE,"In every quarter something visible,"
11188,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Half-seen or wholly, lost and found again,"
11189,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Alternate progress and impediment,"
11190,HOME AT GRASMERE,And yet a growing prospect in the main.                          490
11191,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Such pleasure now is mine, albeit forced,"
11192,HOME AT GRASMERE,Herein less happy than the Traveller
11193,HOME AT GRASMERE,To cast from time to time a painful look
11194,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Upon unwelcome things, which unawares"
11195,HOME AT GRASMERE,Reveal themselves; not therefore is my heart                     495
11196,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Depressed, nor does it fear what is to come,"
11197,HOME AT GRASMERE,"But confident, enriched at every glance."
11198,HOME AT GRASMERE,The more I see the more delight my mind
11199,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Receives, or by reflexion can create."
11200,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Truth justifies herself, and as she dwells                       500"
11201,HOME AT GRASMERE,"With Hope, who would not follow where she leads?"
11202,HOME AT GRASMERE,Nor let me pass unheeded other loves
11203,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Where no fear is, and humbler sympathies."
11204,HOME AT GRASMERE,Already hath sprung up within my heart
11205,HOME AT GRASMERE,A liking for the small grey horse that bears                     505
11206,HOME AT GRASMERE,"The paralytic man, and for the brute--"
11207,HOME AT GRASMERE,"In Scripture sanctified--the patient brute,"
11208,HOME AT GRASMERE,"On which the cripple, in the quarry maimed,"
11209,HOME AT GRASMERE,Rides to and fro: I know them and their ways.[370]
11210,HOME AT GRASMERE,"The famous sheep-dog, first in all the Vale,                     510"
11211,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Though yet to me a stranger, will not be"
11212,HOME AT GRASMERE,"A stranger long; nor will the blind man’s guide,"
11213,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Meek and neglected thing, of no renown!"
11214,HOME AT GRASMERE,Soon will peep forth the primrose; ere it fades
11215,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Friends shall I have at dawn, blackbird and thrush               515"
11216,HOME AT GRASMERE,"To rouse me, and a hundred warblers more;"
11217,HOME AT GRASMERE,And if those eagles to their ancient hold
11218,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Return, Helvellyn’s eagles! with the pair"
11219,HOME AT GRASMERE,From my own door I shall be free to claim
11220,HOME AT GRASMERE,Acquaintance as they sweep from cloud to cloud.                  520
11221,HOME AT GRASMERE,The owl that gives the name to Owlet-Crag
11222,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Have I heard whooping, and he soon will be"
11223,HOME AT GRASMERE,A chosen one of my regards. See there
11224,HOME AT GRASMERE,The heifer in yon little croft belongs
11225,HOME AT GRASMERE,To one who holds it dear; with duteous care                      525
11226,HOME AT GRASMERE,"She reared it, and in speaking of her charge"
11227,HOME AT GRASMERE,I heard her scatter some endearing words
11228,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Domestic, and in spirit motherly"
11229,HOME AT GRASMERE,"She being herself a Mother, happy Beast"
11230,HOME AT GRASMERE,If the caresses of a human voice                                 530
11231,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Can make it so, and care of human hands."
11232,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And ye as happy under Nature’s care,"
11233,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Strangers to me, and all men, or at least"
11234,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Strangers to all particular amity,"
11235,HOME AT GRASMERE,All intercourse of knowledge or of love                          535
11236,HOME AT GRASMERE,"That parts the individual from his kind,"
11237,HOME AT GRASMERE,Whether in large communities ye keep
11238,HOME AT GRASMERE,"From year to year, not shunning Man’s abode,"
11239,HOME AT GRASMERE,"A settled residence, or be from far,"
11240,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Wild creatures, and of many homes, that come                     540"
11241,HOME AT GRASMERE,"The gift of winds, and whom the winds again"
11242,HOME AT GRASMERE,Take from us at your pleasure--yet shall ye
11243,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Not want, for this, your own subordinate place"
11244,HOME AT GRASMERE,In my affections. Witness the delight
11245,HOME AT GRASMERE,With which erewhile I saw that multitude                         545
11246,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Wheel through the sky, and see them now at rest,"
11247,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Yet not at rest, upon the glassy lake."
11248,HOME AT GRASMERE,"They _cannot_ rest, they gambol like young whelps;"
11249,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Active as lambs, and overcome with joy."
11250,HOME AT GRASMERE,"They try all frolic motions; flutter, plunge,                    550"
11251,HOME AT GRASMERE,And beat the passive water with their wings.
11252,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Too distant are they for plain view, but lo!"
11253,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Those little fountains, sparkling in the sun,"
11254,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Betray their occupation, rising up,"
11255,HOME AT GRASMERE,"First one and then another silver spout,                         555"
11256,HOME AT GRASMERE,"As one or other takes the fit of glee,"
11257,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Fountains and spouts, yet somewhat in the guise"
11258,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of play-thing fire-works, that on festal nights"
11259,HOME AT GRASMERE,Sparkle about the feet of wanton boys.
11260,HOME AT GRASMERE,"--How vast the compass of this theatre,                          560"
11261,HOME AT GRASMERE,Yet nothing to be seen but lovely pomp
11262,HOME AT GRASMERE,And silent majesty; the birch-tree woods
11263,HOME AT GRASMERE,Are hung with thousand thousand diamond drops
11264,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of melted hoar-frost, every tiny knot"
11265,HOME AT GRASMERE,"In the bare twigs, each little budding place                     565"
11266,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Cased with its several beads, what myriads there"
11267,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Upon one tree, while all the distant grove"
11268,HOME AT GRASMERE,That rises to the summit of the steep
11269,HOME AT GRASMERE,Shows like a mountain built of silver light.
11270,HOME AT GRASMERE,"See yonder the same pageant, and again                           570"
11271,HOME AT GRASMERE,Behold the universal imagery
11272,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Inverted, all its sun-bright features touched"
11273,HOME AT GRASMERE,"As with the varnish, and the gloss of dreams;"
11274,HOME AT GRASMERE,Dreamlike the blending also of the whole
11275,HOME AT GRASMERE,Harmonious landscape; all along the shore                        575
11276,HOME AT GRASMERE,"The boundary lost, the line invisible"
11277,HOME AT GRASMERE,That parts the image from reality;
11278,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And the clear hills, as high as they ascend"
11279,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Heavenward, so piercing deep the lake below."
11280,HOME AT GRASMERE,Admonished of the days of love to come                           580
11281,HOME AT GRASMERE,"The raven croaks, and fills the upper air"
11282,HOME AT GRASMERE,With a strange sound of genial harmony;[371]
11283,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And in and all about that playful band,"
11284,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Incapable although they be of rest,"
11285,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And in their fashion very rioters,                               585"
11286,HOME AT GRASMERE,"There is a stillness, and they seem to make"
11287,HOME AT GRASMERE,Calm revelry in that their calm abode.
11288,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Them leaving to their joyous hours I pass,"
11289,HOME AT GRASMERE,Pass with a thought the life of the whole year
11290,HOME AT GRASMERE,"That is to come, the throng of woodland flowers,                 590"
11291,HOME AT GRASMERE,And lilies that will dance upon the waves.
11292,HOME AT GRASMERE,Say boldly then that solitude is not
11293,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Where these things are. He truly is alone,"
11294,HOME AT GRASMERE,He of the multitude whose eyes are doomed
11295,HOME AT GRASMERE,To hold a vacant commerce day by day                             595
11296,HOME AT GRASMERE,"With objects wanting life, repelling love;"
11297,HOME AT GRASMERE,"He by the vast Metropolis immured,"
11298,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Where pity shrinks from unremitting calls,"
11299,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Where numbers overwhelm humanity,"
11300,HOME AT GRASMERE,And neighbourhood serves rather to divide                        600
11301,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Than to unite. What sighs more deep than his,"
11302,HOME AT GRASMERE,Whose nobler will hath long been sacrificed;
11303,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Who must inhabit, under a black sky,"
11304,HOME AT GRASMERE,"A City where, if indifference to disgust"
11305,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Yield not, to scorn, or sorrow, living men                       605"
11306,HOME AT GRASMERE,Are ofttimes to their fellow-men no more
11307,HOME AT GRASMERE,Than to the forest hermit are the leaves
11308,HOME AT GRASMERE,"That hang aloft in myriads--nay, far less,"
11309,HOME AT GRASMERE,"For they protect his walk from sun and shower,"
11310,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Swell his devotion with their voice in storms,                   610"
11311,HOME AT GRASMERE,And whisper while the stars twinkle among them
11312,HOME AT GRASMERE,"His lullaby. From crowded streets remote,"
11313,HOME AT GRASMERE,Far from the living and dead wilderness
11314,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of the thronged world, Society is here[372]"
11315,HOME AT GRASMERE,"A true Community, a genuine frame                                615"
11316,HOME AT GRASMERE,Of many into one incorporate.
11317,HOME AT GRASMERE,"_That_ must be looked for here, paternal sway,"
11318,HOME AT GRASMERE,"One household under God for high and low,"
11319,HOME AT GRASMERE,"One family, and one mansion; to themselves"
11320,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Appropriate, and divided from the world                          620"
11321,HOME AT GRASMERE,"As if it were a cave, a multitude"
11322,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Human and brute, possessors undisturbed"
11323,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of this recess, their legislative hall,"
11324,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Their Temple, and their glorious dwelling-place."
11325,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Dismissing therefore, all Arcadian dreams,                     625"
11326,HOME AT GRASMERE,"All golden fancies of the golden age,"
11327,HOME AT GRASMERE,The bright array of shadowy thoughts from times
11328,HOME AT GRASMERE,"That were before all time, or is to be"
11329,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Ere time expire, the pageantry that stirs"
11330,HOME AT GRASMERE,And will be stirring when our eyes are fixed                     630
11331,HOME AT GRASMERE,"On lovely objects, and we wish to part"
11332,HOME AT GRASMERE,"With all remembrance of a jarring world,"
11333,HOME AT GRASMERE,"--Take we at once this one sufficient hope,"
11334,HOME AT GRASMERE,"What need of more? that we shall neither droop,"
11335,HOME AT GRASMERE,Nor pine for want of pleasure in the life                        635
11336,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Scattered about us, nor through dearth of aught"
11337,HOME AT GRASMERE,That keeps in health the insatiable mind;
11338,HOME AT GRASMERE,That we shall have for knowledge and for love
11339,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Abundance; and that, feeling as we do"
11340,HOME AT GRASMERE,"How goodly, how exceeding fair, how pure                         640"
11341,HOME AT GRASMERE,"From all reproach is yon ethereal vault,"
11342,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And this deep vale its earthly counterpart,"
11343,HOME AT GRASMERE,"By which, and under which, we are enclosed"
11344,HOME AT GRASMERE,"To breathe in peace, we shall moreover find"
11345,HOME AT GRASMERE,"(If sound, and what we ought to be ourselves,                    645"
11346,HOME AT GRASMERE,If rightly we observe and justly weigh)
11347,HOME AT GRASMERE,The inmates not unworthy of their home
11348,HOME AT GRASMERE,The dwellers of their dwelling.
11349,HOME AT GRASMERE,And if this
11350,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Were otherwise, we have within ourselves"
11351,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Enough to fill the present day with joy,                         650"
11352,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And overspread the future years with hope,"
11353,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Our beautiful and quiet home, enriched"
11354,HOME AT GRASMERE,Already with a stranger whom we love
11355,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Deeply, a stranger of our father’s house,"
11356,HOME AT GRASMERE,"A never-resting Pilgrim of the Sea,[373]                         655"
11357,HOME AT GRASMERE,Who finds at last an hour to his content
11358,HOME AT GRASMERE,Beneath our roof. And others whom we love
11359,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Will seek us also, sisters of our hearts,[374]"
11360,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And one, like them, a brother of our hearts,"
11361,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Philosopher and Poet,[375] in whose sight                        660"
11362,HOME AT GRASMERE,These mountains will rejoice with open joy.
11363,HOME AT GRASMERE,"--Such is our wealth; O Vale of Peace, we are"
11364,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And must be, with God’s will, a happy band."
11365,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Yet ’tis not to enjoy that we exist,"
11366,HOME AT GRASMERE,For that end only; something must be done.                       665
11367,HOME AT GRASMERE,I must not walk in unreproved delight
11368,HOME AT GRASMERE,"These narrow bounds, and think of nothing more,"
11369,HOME AT GRASMERE,"No duty that looks further, and no care."
11370,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Each being has his office, lowly some"
11371,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And common, yet all worthy if fulfilled                          670"
11372,HOME AT GRASMERE,"With zeal, acknowledgment that with the gift"
11373,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Keeps pace, a harvest answering to the seed--"
11374,HOME AT GRASMERE,Of ill-advised Ambition and of Pride
11375,HOME AT GRASMERE,"I would stand clear, but yet to me I feel"
11376,HOME AT GRASMERE,That an internal brightness is vouchsafed                        675
11377,HOME AT GRASMERE,"That must not die, that must not pass away."
11378,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Why does this inward lustre fondly seek,"
11379,HOME AT GRASMERE,And gladly blend with outward fellowship?
11380,HOME AT GRASMERE,Why do _they_ shine around me whom I love?
11381,HOME AT GRASMERE,Why do they teach me whom I thus revere?                         680
11382,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Strange question, yet it answers not itself."
11383,HOME AT GRASMERE,"That humble roof embowered among the trees,"
11384,HOME AT GRASMERE,"That calm fire-side, it is not even in them,"
11385,HOME AT GRASMERE,"--Blest as they are--to furnish a reply,"
11386,HOME AT GRASMERE,That satisfies and ends in perfect rest.                         685
11387,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Possessions have I that are solely mine,"
11388,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Something within which yet is shared by none,"
11389,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Not even the nearest to me and most dear,"
11390,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Something which power and effort may impart,"
11391,HOME AT GRASMERE,"I would impart it, I would spread it wide,                       690"
11392,HOME AT GRASMERE,Immortal in the world which is to come.
11393,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Forgive me if I add another claim,"
11394,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And would not wholly perish even in this,"
11395,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Lie down and be forgotten in the dust,"
11396,HOME AT GRASMERE,I and the modest partners of my days                             695
11397,HOME AT GRASMERE,Making a silent company in death;
11398,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Love, knowledge, all my manifold delights"
11399,HOME AT GRASMERE,All buried with me without monument
11400,HOME AT GRASMERE,Or profit unto any but ourselves.
11401,HOME AT GRASMERE,"It must not be, if I, divinely taught,                           700"
11402,HOME AT GRASMERE,Be privileged to speak as I have felt
11403,HOME AT GRASMERE,Of what in man is human or divine.
11404,HOME AT GRASMERE,"While yet an innocent little-one, with a heart"
11405,HOME AT GRASMERE,"That doubtless wanted not its tender moods,"
11406,HOME AT GRASMERE,I breathed (for this I better recollect)                         705
11407,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Among wild appetites and blind desires,"
11408,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Motions of savage instinct, my delight"
11409,HOME AT GRASMERE,And exaltation. Nothing at that time
11410,HOME AT GRASMERE,"So welcome, no temptation half so dear"
11411,HOME AT GRASMERE,As that which urged me to a daring feat.                         710
11412,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Deep pools, tall trees, black chasms, and dizzy crags,"
11413,HOME AT GRASMERE,And tottering towers; I loved to stand and read
11414,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Their looks forbidding, read and disobey,"
11415,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Sometimes in act, and evermore in thought."
11416,HOME AT GRASMERE,With impulses that scarcely were by these                        715
11417,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Surpassed in strength, I heard of danger, met"
11418,HOME AT GRASMERE,Or sought with courage; enterprize forlorn
11419,HOME AT GRASMERE,"By one, sole keeper of his own intent,"
11420,HOME AT GRASMERE,Or by a resolute few who for the sake
11421,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of glory, fronted multitudes in arms.                            720"
11422,HOME AT GRASMERE,Yea to this hour I cannot read a tale
11423,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Of two brave vessels matched in deadly fight,"
11424,HOME AT GRASMERE,"And fighting to the death, but I am pleased"
11425,HOME AT GRASMERE,"More than a wise man ought to be. I wish,"
11426,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Fret, burn, and struggle, and in soul am there;                  725"
11427,HOME AT GRASMERE,"But me hath Nature tamed, and bade to seek"
11428,HOME AT GRASMERE,"For other agitations, or be calm;"
11429,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Hath dealt with me as with a turbulent stream,"
11430,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Some nursling of the mountains, which she leads"
11431,HOME AT GRASMERE,"Through quiet meadows, after he has learnt                       730"
11432,HOME AT GRASMERE,"His strength, and had his triumph and his joy,"

11877,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN
11878,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,
11879,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,Composed 1808.--Published 1839
11880,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,
11881,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,This poem was first printed in De Quincey’s “Recollections of
11882,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,"Grasmere,” which appeared in _Tait’s Edinburgh Magazine_, September"
11883,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,"1839, p. 573, and afterwards in his _Recollections of the Lakes_"
11884,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,"(1853), p. 23."
11885,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,
11886,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,The text is printed as it is found in De Quincey’s article. Doubtless
11887,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,"Wordsworth, or some member of the family, had supplied him with a"
11888,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,copy of these verses. Wordsworth himself seemed to have thought them
11889,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,unworthy of publication. A copy of the poem was transcribed at Grasmere
11890,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,by Dorothy Wordsworth for Lady Beaumont on the 20th April 1808. In
11891,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,this copy there are numerous variations from the text as published by
11892,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,"De Quincey, and these are indicated in the footnotes. In the letter to"
11893,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,"Lady Beaumont, Dorothy Wordsworth says, “I am going to transcribe a"
11894,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,poem composed by my brother a few days after his return. It was begun
11895,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,in the churchyard when he was looking at the grave of the Husband and
11896,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,"Wife, and is in fact supposed to be entirely composed there.”"
11897,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,
11898,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,"Wordsworth returned to his old home at Dove Cottage, Grasmere, after a"
11899,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,"short visit to London, on the 6th April 1808; and there he remained,"
11900,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,till Allan Bank was ready for occupation. I therefore conclude that
11901,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,this poem was written in April 1808.
11902,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,
11903,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,"Compare De Quincey’s account of the disaster that befell the Greens, as"
11904,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,reported in his _Early Recollections of Grasmere_. The Wordsworths had
11905,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,evidently taken part in the effort to raise subscriptions in behalf of
11906,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,the orphan children. They issued a printed appeal on the subject. The
11907,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,following is an extract from a letter of Dorothy Wordsworth’s to Lady
11908,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,Beaumont on the subject:--
11909,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,
11910,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,"“GRASMERE, _April 20th, 1808_."
11911,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,
11912,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,"“We received your letter this morning, enclosing the half of a"
11913,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,£5 note. I am happy to inform you that the orphans have been
11914,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,fixed under the care of very respectable people. The baby is
11915,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,with its sister--she who filled the Mother’s place in the house
11916,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,during their two days of fearless solitude. It has clung to her
11917,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,"ever since, and she has been its sole nurse. I went with two"
11918,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,"ladies of the Committee (in my sister’s place, who was then"
11919,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,confined to poor John’s bedside) to conduct the family to their
11920,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,"separate homes. The two Girls are together, as I have said; two"
11921,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,Boys at another Home; and the third Boy by himself at the house
11922,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,of an elderly man who had a particular friendship for their
11923,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,father. The kind reception that the children met with was very
11924,GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN,affecting.”

12718,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,Pleasure unbidden is their guide
12719,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,Their leader--faithful to their side

12721,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,"The ambitious leap, the emulous race,"
12722,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,"The startling shout, the mimic chase,"
12723,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,The simple half-disguisèd wile
12724,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,Detected through the flattering smile.
12725,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,
12726,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,A truce to this unbridled course                                  75
12727,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,Doth intervene--no need of force.
12728,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,We spread upon the flowery grass

12730,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,"Obeys the call--we form a Round,"
12731,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,And all are seated on the ground.                                 80

12733,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,"The sun’s meridian hour is passed,"
12734,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,"Again begins the emulous race,"

12736,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,"And thus was spent that vernal day,"
12737,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,Till twilight checked the noisy play;                             85
12738,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,Then did they feel a languor spread
12739,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,"Over their limbs, the beating tread"
12740,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,Was stilled--the busy throbbing heart--
12741,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,And silently we all depart.

12769,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,That summons him to matin-prayer.
12770,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,
12771,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,And is it sorrow that they feel?                                 115
12772,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,"Nay! call it not by such a name,"
12773,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,The stroke of sadness that doth steal
12774,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,"With rapid motion through their hearts,"
12775,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,When comes the thought that yesterday
12776,BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH,"With all its joys is passed away,                                120"

12852,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Mindful that thou (ah! wherefore by my Muse                       15
12853,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,So long unthanked) hast cheered a simple board
12854,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,With beverage pure as ever fixed the choice
12855,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Of hermit, dubious where to scoop his cell;"
12856,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Which Persian kings might envy; and thy meek
12857,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,And gentle aspect oft has ministered                              20
12858,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,To finer uses. They for me must cease;
12859,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Days will pass on, the year, if years be given,"
12860,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Fade,--and the moralising mind derive"
12861,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,No lessons from the presence of a Power
12862,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,By the inconstant nature we inherit                               25
12863,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Unmatched in delicate beneficence;
12864,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,For neither unremitting rains avail
12865,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,To swell thee into voice; nor longest drought
12866,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Thy bounty stints, nor can thy beauty mar,"
12867,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Beauty not therefore wanting change to stir                       30
12868,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,The fancy pleased by spectacles unlooked for.
12869,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Nor yet, perchance, translucent Spring, had tolled"
12870,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,The Norman curfew bell when human hands
12871,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,First offered help that the deficient rock
12872,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Might overarch thee, from pernicious heat                         35"
12873,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Defended, and appropriate to man’s need."
12874,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Such ties will not be severed: but, when we"
12875,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Are gone, what summer loiterer will regard,"
12876,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Inquisitive, thy countenance, will peruse,"
12877,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Pleased to detect the dimpling stir of life,                      40"
12878,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,The breathing faculty with which thou yield’st
12879,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,(Tho’ a mere goblet to the careless eye)
12880,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Boons inexhaustible? Who, hurrying on"
12881,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"With a step quickened by November’s cold,"
12882,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Shall pause, the skill admiring that can work                     45"
12883,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Upon thy chance-defilements--withered twigs
12884,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"That, lodged within thy crystal depths, seem bright,"
12885,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,As if they from a silver tree had fallen--
12886,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"And oaken leaves that, driven by whirling blasts,"
12887,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Sunk down, and lay immersed in dead repose                        50"
12888,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,For Time’s invisible tooth to prey upon
12889,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Unsightly objects and uncoveted,"
12890,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Till thou with crystal bead-drops didst encrust
12891,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Their skeletons, turned to brilliant ornaments."
12892,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"But, from thy bosom, should some venturous[396] hand              55"
12893,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Abstract those gleaming relics, and uplift them,"
12894,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"However gently, toward the vulgar air,"
12895,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"At once their tender brightness disappears,"
12896,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Leaving the intermeddler to upbraid
12897,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"His folly. Thus (I feel it while I speak),                        60"
12898,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Thus, with the fibres of these thoughts it fares;"
12899,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"And oh! how much, of all that love creates"
12900,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Or beautifies, like changes undergo,"
12901,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Suffers like loss when drawn out of the soul,"
12902,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Its silent laboratory! Words should say                           65
12903,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,(Could they depict the marvels of thy cell)
12904,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,How often I have marked a plumy fern
12905,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,From the live rock with grace inimitable
12906,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Bending its apex toward a paler self
12907,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Reflected all in perfect lineaments--                             70
12908,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Shadow and substance kissing point to point
12909,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"In mutual stillness; or, if some faint breeze"
12910,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Entering the cell gave restlessness to one,"
12911,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"The other, glassed in thy unruffled breast,"
12912,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Partook of every motion, met, retired,                            75"
12913,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"And met again. Such playful sympathy,"
12914,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Such delicate caress as in the shape
12915,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Of this green plant had aptly recompensed
12916,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,For baffled lips and disappointed arms
12917,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"And hopeless pangs, the spirit of that youth,                     80"
12918,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,The fair Narcissus by some pitying God
12919,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Changed to a crimson flower; when he, whose pride"
12920,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Provoked a retribution too severe,"
12921,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Had pined; upon his watery duplicate
12922,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Wasting that love the nymphs implored in vain.                    85
12923,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Thus while my Fancy wanders, thou, clear Spring,"
12924,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Moved (shall I say?) like a dear friend who meets
12925,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"A parting moment with her loveliest look,"
12926,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"And seemingly her happiest, look so fair"
12927,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"It frustrates its own purpose, and recalls                        90"
12928,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,The grieved one whom it meant to send away--
12929,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Dost tempt me by disclosures exquisite
12930,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"To linger, bending over thee: for now,"
12931,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"What witchcraft, mild enchantress, may with thee"
12932,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Compare! thy earthly bed a moment past                            95
12933,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Palpable to sight as the dry ground,"
12934,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Eludes perception, not by rippling air"
12935,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Concealed, nor through effect of some impure"
12936,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Upstirring; but, abstracted by a charm"
12937,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Of my own cunning, earth mysteriously                            100"
12938,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"From under thee hath vanished, and slant beams"
12939,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"The silent inquest of a western sun,"
12940,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Assisting, lucid well-spring! Thou revealest"
12941,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Communion without check of herbs and flowers,"
12942,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"And the vault’s hoary sides to which they cling,                 105"
12943,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Imaged in downward show; the flower, the Herbs,[397]"
12944,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"_These_ not of earthly texture, and the vault"
12945,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Not _there_ diminutive, but through a scale"
12946,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"Of vision less and less distinct, descending"
12947,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,To gloom imperishable. So (if truths                             110
12948,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,The highest condescend to be set forth
12949,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"By processes minute), even so--when thought"

12954,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"We love, but that the residues of flesh,"

12958,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,And Nature deepens into Nature’s God.

12968,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,Yet to the measure of thy promises
12969,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"True, as the mightiest; upon thee, sequestered"
12970,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"For meditation, nor inopportune"
12971,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,For social interest such as I have shared.

12980,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,"To be waylaid by her betrothed, peace"
12981,MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE,And pleasure sobered down to happiness!

14235,CHORUS,[429] This “Ode” was printed and sung at Cambridge on the occasion of
14236,CHORUS,the installation of His Royal Highness Prince Albert as Chancellor of
14237,CHORUS,the University. It was published in the newspapers of the following
14238,CHORUS,"day, as “written for the occasion by the Poet Laureate, by royal"
14239,CHORUS,command.”
14240,CHORUS,
14241,CHORUS,"There is no evidence, however, that Wordsworth wrote a single line"
14242,CHORUS,of it. Dr. Cradock used to attribute the authorship to the poet’s
14243,CHORUS,"nephew, the late Bishop of Lincoln. It is much more likely that Edward"
14244,CHORUS,"Quillinan was the author of the whole, although Christopher Wordsworth"
14245,CHORUS,"may have revised it. Mr. Aubrey de Vere wrote to me, November 12,"
14246,CHORUS,"1893, “It was from Miss Fenwick that I heard that the Laureate poem"
14247,CHORUS,"(_Ode, etc._), was written by Quillinan, at Wordsworth’s request, he"
14248,CHORUS,having himself wholly failed in a reluctant attempt to write one. If

16534,PREFATORY NOTE,
16535,PREFATORY NOTE,My ideal in attempting to prepare a _Bibliography of Wordsworth in
16536,PREFATORY NOTE,"America_ was high. I hoped to see each edition, or at least to identify"
16537,PREFATORY NOTE,the editions hinted at in the various catalogues. I determined to
16538,PREFATORY NOTE,"read every article, in criticism, or review; and to know if the many"
16539,PREFATORY NOTE,"references, given by Poole and other authorities, were correct. As"
16540,PREFATORY NOTE,"is usually the case, the reality has fallen far short of the ideal."
16541,PREFATORY NOTE,"But, while the results are not what were desired, there have been many"
16542,PREFATORY NOTE,fortunate discoveries.
16543,PREFATORY NOTE,
16544,PREFATORY NOTE,"Two things were learned to begin with. First, that astonishingly little"
16545,PREFATORY NOTE,care had been taken to preserve the history of the early American
16546,PREFATORY NOTE,"Editions, or to preserve, even, the earlier American Periodicals."
16547,PREFATORY NOTE,Most of our larger libraries are amazingly deficient in these works.
16548,PREFATORY NOTE,"Second, it was found that existing Catalogues or Lists are not only"
16549,PREFATORY NOTE,"far from complete, but full of gross blunders. Roorbach (the Addenda,"
16550,PREFATORY NOTE,"Supplements, etc.) was found to be a mere rehash of the old trade sales"
16551,PREFATORY NOTE,"Catalogues, swarming with blunders. In the matter of dates, imprints,"
16552,PREFATORY NOTE,"the particular editions, the size of books, Roorbach is utterly"
16553,PREFATORY NOTE,untrustworthy. Allibone (so far as Wordsworth is concerned) is also
16554,PREFATORY NOTE,confusing and incomplete. I did not find much in the various Public or
16555,PREFATORY NOTE,College Library Catalogues.
16556,PREFATORY NOTE,
16557,PREFATORY NOTE,"I wrote to the librarians of some of the older libraries, after I had"
16558,PREFATORY NOTE,"made out a preliminary list, to ascertain if they could add thereto any"
16559,PREFATORY NOTE,"editions, from their cards or manuscript catalogues. From these sources"
16560,PREFATORY NOTE,I was enabled several times to solve seemingly insolvable problems.
16561,PREFATORY NOTE,
16562,PREFATORY NOTE,"I had assistance from, and in some instances visited, the following"
16563,PREFATORY NOTE,"libraries: Cornell University, Boston Public Library, Boston Athenæum,"
16564,PREFATORY NOTE,"Harvard College, Philadelphia Public Library, the Library College of"
16565,PREFATORY NOTE,"Philadelphia, Mercantile Library College, Philadelphia; the Public"
16566,PREFATORY NOTE,"Library, St. Louis; that of Lennox and Astor, the University of"
16567,PREFATORY NOTE,"Virginia, the State Library, Richmond, Va., and one or two other"
16568,PREFATORY NOTE,Southern libraries. I have written more than one hundred letters
16569,PREFATORY NOTE,"to publishers, editors, authors, the descendants of early American"
16570,PREFATORY NOTE,"Wordsworthians, Professors of Literature, and professed Wordsworthians"
16571,PREFATORY NOTE,"in Seminaries and Colleges. I have examined, or employed others to"
16572,PREFATORY NOTE,"examine, the following works for editions of Wordsworth: the _New York"
16573,PREFATORY NOTE,"Literary World_, _Norton’s Literary Gazette_, _American Publishers’"
16574,PREFATORY NOTE,"Circular_, _Publishers’ Weekly_, _Catalogues of Congress Library_, _The"
16575,PREFATORY NOTE,"Port Folio_, _American Quarterly Review_, _Knickerbocker Magazine_,"
16576,PREFATORY NOTE,"_New York Quarterly Review_, _American Review_, _North American"
16577,PREFATORY NOTE,Review_. And this is but half of my story.
16578,PREFATORY NOTE,
16579,PREFATORY NOTE,"Poole’s “Index,” of course, was a great assistance. But I did not rely"
16580,PREFATORY NOTE,"altogether on him, after I had discovered several mistakes in titles"
16581,PREFATORY NOTE,and numbering--mistakes which were confusing in the extreme. I have
16582,PREFATORY NOTE,"consulted all other Indexes and Reference Lists that I could procure,"
16583,PREFATORY NOTE,and have carefully examined the periodicals in which it was possible
16584,PREFATORY NOTE,that such articles could be found.
16585,PREFATORY NOTE,
16586,PREFATORY NOTE,"My greatest light, however, came from responses to personal appeals,"
16587,PREFATORY NOTE,"to those in the North, South, East, and West of the Country, who"
16588,PREFATORY NOTE,"enlightened me in particular directions. I needed assistance, not only"
16589,PREFATORY NOTE,"to discover the articles, but more particularly to secure the articles"
16590,PREFATORY NOTE,"to read, or to procure proper persons to read the few articles that I"
16591,PREFATORY NOTE,"could not obtain. When valuable books were sent me, by express, from"
16592,PREFATORY NOTE,"distant College Libraries, that I might read for myself, I realised the"
16593,PREFATORY NOTE,bond there is between Wordsworthians.
16594,PREFATORY NOTE,
16595,PREFATORY NOTE,"I cannot begin to speak of the delight that I have had in this work,"
16596,PREFATORY NOTE,"delight because of the response I have met with, and in opening"
16597,PREFATORY NOTE,"up unknown and rich veins of criticism. I have learned too, that"
16598,PREFATORY NOTE,Wordsworth has many enthusiastic followers in America.
16599,PREFATORY NOTE,
16600,PREFATORY NOTE,I have included in the Bibliography the accounts of visits paid to
16601,PREFATORY NOTE,"Wordsworth by certain well-known Americans, a half-dozen poems on"
16602,PREFATORY NOTE,"Wordsworth, and three or four unpublished Lectures."
16603,PREFATORY NOTE,
16604,PREFATORY NOTE,I am exceedingly grateful to the many who (to my surprise) have
16605,PREFATORY NOTE,"answered my questions, and have given me of their valuable time. I"
16606,PREFATORY NOTE,"am especially indebted to Mr. George P. Philes, of Philadelphia, and"
16607,PREFATORY NOTE,"also to Mr. F. Saunders of the Astor Library, New York. Dean Murray of"
16608,PREFATORY NOTE,"Princeton rendered me exceedingly gracious service, and but for Mr."
16609,PREFATORY NOTE,"Edwin H. Woodruff of Stanford University, California, I should not have"
16610,PREFATORY NOTE,known how or where to begin my investigations.
16611,PREFATORY NOTE,
16612,PREFATORY NOTE,In all probability my work is not perfect. I would that it were. I only
16613,PREFATORY NOTE,"know that I have been enabled, by enthusiasm alone, to lay a foundation"
16614,PREFATORY NOTE,"for Wordsworth Bibliography in America, that may be an assistance to"
16615,PREFATORY NOTE,"future scholars, and will aid the next Wordsworthian who is brave"
16616,PREFATORY NOTE,enough to build enduringly.

16635,INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH,"of Macmillan, and several of Crowell. The Harpers wrote me that these"
16636,INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH,various publications were possible in view of the fact that there
16637,INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH,"was no copyright of the work, and that all of them might properly be"
16638,INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH,called American Editions. I have not placed those bearing the Macmillan
16639,INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH,"imprint, of course, among purely American editions. Nor have I included"
16640,INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH,"the several cheap ones of Crowell. The one of Crowell, given in the"
16641,INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH,"list, is copyrighted by the Crowell Company."
16642,INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH,
16643,INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH,The fact that the introduction of Wordsworth’s poetry into America is
16644,INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH,"so easily authenticated, and that the history of it is so concise,"
16645,INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH,is my apology for deviating from ordinary bibliographical rule in
16646,INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH,including among the regular editions certain numbers of America’s first
16647,INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH,"Literary Journal, and two or three other volumes."
16648,INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH,
16649,INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH,I have confined myself to a simple chronological arrangement of the
16650,INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH,"Editions, with place of imprint, name of publisher, number, and size"
16651,INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH,"of volumes. This makes the most convenient list for easy reference,"

17016,C. M. ST. JOHN.,"Ballads,” which had fallen dead in his own country in 1798, being"
17017,C. M. ST. JOHN.,published in Philadelphia in 1802. The American edition was delayed in

18709,INFLUENCE,"Wordsworth’s influence on French literature was altogether very slight,"
18710,INFLUENCE,"nor did it make itself felt till about 1830; when, after a very limited"
18711,INFLUENCE,"period, it silently died away."
18712,INFLUENCE,
18713,INFLUENCE,"Wordsworth was but little known by his contemporary Châteaubriand, who"
18714,INFLUENCE,merely names him among other poets in his _Essai sur la Littérature
18715,INFLUENCE,"anglaise_. Byron, Walter Scott, and in a lesser degree Thomas"
18716,INFLUENCE,"Moore, were the only writers of Great Britain whose works told on"
18717,INFLUENCE,"our literature at that time. Villemain, in his criticism of Byron,"
18718,INFLUENCE,contemptuously dismisses all the so-called lake-poets to fix on his
18719,INFLUENCE,"hero. He calls them: “Des métaphysiciens, raisonneurs sans invention,"
18720,INFLUENCE,"mélancoliques sans passion, qui, dans l’éternelle rêverie d’une vie"
18721,INFLUENCE,"étroite et peu agitée, n’avaient produit que des singularités sans"

18725,INFLUENCE,"To Byron also, and to him alone (Ossian being excepted) among the"

18727,INFLUENCE,Wordsworth once; but still the striking analogy between the ideas and
18728,INFLUENCE,imaginative style of both cannot fail to be noticed by the reader.
18729,INFLUENCE,Without insisting on a parallel that might be drawn between many pages
18730,INFLUENCE,"of _The Excursion_ and of _Jocelyn_, I will only point out two short"

18751,INFLUENCE,"M. Coppée has often been called a French Wordsworth, owing to his"

18753,INFLUENCE,"partiality as the English Poet does for humble themes and characters,"
18754,INFLUENCE,together with a bold attempt to naturalise trivial or ludicrous
18755,INFLUENCE,"details in serious poetry; but there is no proof, as far as I know, of"
18756,INFLUENCE,Wordsworth’s influence having been strong upon him.
18757,INFLUENCE,
18758,INFLUENCE,"If we except two or three disciples of Wordsworth, neither he, nor"
18759,INFLUENCE,"the lake-poets taken as a whole, seem to have been much thought of, or"

18761,INFLUENCE,generally been used as a synonym for “weak and doleful mysticism.”

18776,INFLUENCE,seems to derive the word _Lakiste_ from Lamartine’s poem called _Le

18778,INFLUENCE,"croire que Lamartine, parce qu’il y a toujours chez lui une vibration"
18779,INFLUENCE,"et une résonnance de harpe éolienne, ne soit qu’un mélodieux _lakiste_"
18780,INFLUENCE,et ne sache que soupirer mollement la mélancolie et l’amour. S’il a le

18783,INFLUENCE,"I now come to the man who, first and foremost among our poets and"
18784,INFLUENCE,"critics, paid due homage to Wordsworth, _i.e._ Sainte-Beuve. I have"
18785,INFLUENCE,already enumerated his several translations in verse from Wordsworth.
18786,INFLUENCE,"Strange to say, the voluminous critic has no single article with"
18787,INFLUENCE,"Wordsworth for its main subject; but, whoever will go through his many"
18788,INFLUENCE,volumes will find many judicious and admiring references to the poet.
18789,INFLUENCE,
18790,INFLUENCE,"Moreover, as a poet, Sainte-Beuve has endeavoured to naturalise in"
18791,INFLUENCE,France the poetic style that has been associated with the name of
18792,INFLUENCE,Wordsworth. He expressly claims Wordsworth as one of his masters in his
18793,INFLUENCE,_Consolations_ xviii. “A Antony Deschamps.” Among his bosom-poets he
18794,INFLUENCE,reckons--
18795,INFLUENCE,
18796,INFLUENCE,"…Wordsworth peu connu, qui des lacs solitaires"
18797,INFLUENCE,"Sait tòus les bleus reflets, les bruits et les mystères,"
18798,INFLUENCE,"Et qui, depuis trente ans vivant au même lieu,"
18799,INFLUENCE,"En contemplation devant le même Dieu,"
18800,INFLUENCE,"A travers les soupirs de la mousse et de l’onde,"
18801,INFLUENCE,"Distingue, au soir, des chants venus d’un meilleur monde."
18802,INFLUENCE,
18803,INFLUENCE,The original attempt of Sainte-Beuve (for he was original in his very
18804,INFLUENCE,choice of Wordsworth as a model at a time when Byron engrossed all
18805,INFLUENCE,the admiration of the French poets) has been ably characterised by
18806,INFLUENCE,"Théophile Gautier in his “Portraits Contemporains” (pp. 208, 209), an"
18807,INFLUENCE,"article reprinted from _La Gazette de Paris_, 19 Novembre 1871:--"
18808,INFLUENCE,
18809,INFLUENCE,“(Sainte-Beuve) avait été en poésie un inventeur. Il avait
18810,INFLUENCE,"donné une note nouvelle et toute moderne, et de tout le cénacle"
18811,INFLUENCE,c’était à coup sûr le plus réellement romantique. Dans cette
18812,INFLUENCE,humble poésie qui rappelle par la sincérité du sentiment et
18813,INFLUENCE,"la minutie du détail observé sur nature, les vers de Crabbe,"
18814,INFLUENCE,"de Wordsworth, et de Cowper, Sainte-Beuve s’est frayé de"
18815,INFLUENCE,"petits sentiers à mi-côte, bordés d’humbles fleurettes, où nul"
18816,INFLUENCE,en France n’a passé avant lui. Sa facture un peu laborieuse
18817,INFLUENCE,et compliquée vient de la difficulté de réduire à la forme
18818,INFLUENCE,métrique des idées et des images non exprimées encore ou
18819,INFLUENCE,"dédaignées jusque-là, mais que de morceaux merveilleusement"
18820,INFLUENCE,venus où l’effort n’est plus sensible!”
18821,INFLUENCE,
18822,INFLUENCE,Sainte-Beuve’s admiration of Wordsworth is a well-known fact. Less
18823,INFLUENCE,generally known is the influence of this admiration on several poets
18824,INFLUENCE,"of that time (_circa_ 1830-40), who, either through Sainte-Beuve’s"
18825,INFLUENCE,"imitations, or with a direct knowledge of Wordsworth’s poems, to the"
18826,INFLUENCE,"reading of which they had thus been stimulated, offer great marks of"
18827,INFLUENCE,resemblance with Wordsworth. I have quoted a judgment of De Vigny that
18828,INFLUENCE,considers Brizeux and Barbier as having turned _laquistes_ through
18829,INFLUENCE,Sainte-Beuve. I know no other immediate proof of this influence.
18830,INFLUENCE,Perhaps Barbier and Brizeux have consigned it somewhere. Anyhow Brizeux
18831,INFLUENCE,"with his glorification of his youthful years and school-time, with"
18832,INFLUENCE,"his intense love of his native Brittany, his fond attachment to local"
18833,INFLUENCE,"customs and habits, his lamentations on the death of the poetical poet"
18834,INFLUENCE,"as embodied in his own province (_Élégie de la Bretagne_), is to all"
18835,INFLUENCE,extent and purposes the most thoroughly Wordsworthian of all our poets.
18836,INFLUENCE,"There may be more of Wordsworth’s _philosophy_ in Lamartine, but there"
18837,INFLUENCE,is more of his _poetry_ proper in Brizeux.
18838,INFLUENCE,
18839,INFLUENCE,The influence of Wordsworth on Maurice de Guérin and Hippolyte de la
18840,INFLUENCE,"Morvonnais, is more easily ascertained than the preceding. Here, again,"
18841,INFLUENCE,Sainte-Beuve appears to have been the intermediate agent.[582]
18842,INFLUENCE,
18843,INFLUENCE,"In 1832-33 Maurice de Guérin, fresh from the reading of the"
18844,INFLUENCE,"_Consolations_, and De la Morvonnais, who came to be a direct admirer"
18845,INFLUENCE,"of the Lake Poets, and chiefly of Wordsworth, set to write short"
18846,INFLUENCE,poems which they aspired to make as little different from prose as
18847,INFLUENCE,"possible, rejecting all traditional ornaments, and making little of"
18848,INFLUENCE,the rhythmical improvements of the _Romantiques_ proper. Some of those
18849,INFLUENCE,pieces were inserted in a local paper as downright prose (no stop
18850,INFLUENCE,"intervening at the end of the lines), whereas the said paper would"
18851,INFLUENCE,"not have made room for verse.[583] This looks like trifling, but the"
18852,INFLUENCE,earnestness of this attempted revolution is shown in the interesting
18853,INFLUENCE,poems of Maurice de Guérin. Another outcome of this was an intended
18854,INFLUENCE,"publication on Wordsworth, of which it is impossible to say whether it"
18855,INFLUENCE,"was to be a criticism, or a translation, of the English Poet. It is"
18856,INFLUENCE,"thus mentioned in a letter of Guérin to De la Morvonnais of June 30,"
18857,INFLUENCE,1836: “Nous avons adressé des circulaires à un grand nombre d’éditeurs
18858,INFLUENCE,pour l’impression Wordsworth. Nous attendons la réponse d’un moment à
18859,INFLUENCE,"l’autre.” The answer must have been unfavourable, as nothing more was"
18860,INFLUENCE,heard of the intended publication.
18861,INFLUENCE,
18862,INFLUENCE,The early death of Guérin left it for De la Morvonnais alone to spread
18863,INFLUENCE,the influence of Wordsworth’s poetry in France. Of him we read in
18864,INFLUENCE,Sainte-Beuve’s _Étude sur Maurice de Guérin_:--
18865,INFLUENCE,
18866,INFLUENCE,"“La Morvonnais, vers ce temps même (1834), en était fort"
18867,INFLUENCE,"préoccupé (des lakistes et de leur poésie), au point d’aller"
18868,INFLUENCE,"visiter Wordsworth à sa résidence de Rydal Mount, près des lacs"
18869,INFLUENCE,"du Westmoreland, et de rester en correspondance avec ce grand"
18870,INFLUENCE,"et pacifique esprit, avec ce patriarche de la Muse intime."
18871,INFLUENCE,"Guérin, sans tant y songer, ressemblait mieux aux Lakistes en"
18872,INFLUENCE,ne visant nullement à les imiter.”
18873,INFLUENCE,
18874,INFLUENCE,Of the supposed correspondence between Wordsworth and De la Morvonnais
18875,INFLUENCE,"no trace remains. M. Hippolyte de la Blanchardière, De la Morvonnais’"
18876,INFLUENCE,"grandson, has informed me that in the collection of his grandfather’s"
18877,INFLUENCE,letters there is no letter of Wordsworth to be found. That at least
18878,INFLUENCE,a Study of Wordsworth existed at the time is proved by the following
18879,INFLUENCE,"preface to his poem _La Thébaïde des Grèves_, written by his friend A."
18880,INFLUENCE,"Duquesnel (ed. by Didier, Quai des Augustins. 1864. p. xxvii.)"
18881,INFLUENCE,
18882,INFLUENCE,“Nous avons trouvé dans les _Reliquiae_ du poète de
18883,INFLUENCE,l’Arguenon[584] de précieuses études sur les lakistes. Il
18884,INFLUENCE,s’était passionné pour ces hommes dans les dix dernières années
18885,INFLUENCE,de sa vie (1843-53).[585] Wordsworth lui semblait plus grand
18886,INFLUENCE,"que Byron, qu’il trouvait trop emphatique, trop solennel,"
18887,INFLUENCE,pas assez près de la nature. L’auteur de _l’Excursion_ a
18888,INFLUENCE,exercé une pénétrante influence sur l’esprit et le cœur de la
18889,INFLUENCE,"Morvonnais, nous trouvons dans ses cahiers des traductions"
18890,INFLUENCE,"en vers de Wordsworth, de Coléridge, de Crabbe, qui, lui, ne"
18891,INFLUENCE,faisait pas partie de ce groupe. Nous les publierons peut-être
18892,INFLUENCE,un jour; elles ont d’autant plus d’intérêt que l’on ne connaît
18893,INFLUENCE,"guère les lakistes en France, que par de rares extraits. Il"
18894,INFLUENCE,"s’était livré, comme on le verra, à une étude approfondie de la"
18895,INFLUENCE,littérature anglaise. Son admiration pour Walter Scott était
18896,INFLUENCE,inexprimable.”
18897,INFLUENCE,
18898,INFLUENCE,"The study and translations above-mentioned have also been lost, many"
18899,INFLUENCE,manuscripts of De la Morvonnais having been destroyed.
18900,INFLUENCE,
18901,INFLUENCE,"It remains for me to point out some allusions to, or imitations of,"
18902,INFLUENCE,Wordsworth in the existing verse of De la Morvonnais.
18903,INFLUENCE,
18904,INFLUENCE,"In the _Thébaïde des Grèves_ (1838), “Le Petit Patour” is a close"
18905,INFLUENCE,"imitation of _We are Seven_, the conclusion being--"
18906,INFLUENCE,

18909,INFLUENCE,
18910,INFLUENCE,"“Le Vagabond,” a story of a vagrant by whom the poet is taught"
18911,INFLUENCE,"resignation, is an imitation of _Resolution and Independence_."
18912,INFLUENCE,
18913,INFLUENCE,In “A Sainte-Beuve” are found these two lines--
18914,INFLUENCE,
18915,INFLUENCE,"J’ai posé sous mon bras mon penseur solitaire,"
18916,INFLUENCE,Mon Wordsworth tant aimé de l’amant du mystère.
18917,INFLUENCE,
18918,INFLUENCE,"In “Dispersion, à Mistress Hemans,” etc., we read this--"
18919,INFLUENCE,
18920,INFLUENCE,"Nous primes un poète, une femme angélique"
18921,INFLUENCE,"Dont peu savent chez nous la voix mélancolique,"
18922,INFLUENCE,"Disciple de Wordsworth, le sublime penseur,"
18923,INFLUENCE,Des lakistes chéris je la nomme la sœur.
18924,INFLUENCE,
18925,INFLUENCE,In “Dernières Paroles” we find this praise of Wordsworth--
18926,INFLUENCE,
18927,INFLUENCE,"Or, ce soir-là, je lus un homme de génie;"
18928,INFLUENCE,Celui dont la mystique et profonde harmonie
18929,INFLUENCE,"Sonne pour les élus des poétiques dons,"
18930,INFLUENCE,Et soulève notre âme en ses grands abandons …
18931,INFLUENCE,…Oh! ne pourrai-je voir
18932,INFLUENCE,"Ces lacs du Westmoreland, mon désir, mon espoir?"
18933,INFLUENCE,…
18934,INFLUENCE,Cet homme est honoré des puissances secrètes;
18935,INFLUENCE,"Lui mort, à ses beaux lacs, romantiques retraites,"
18936,INFLUENCE,"Des pèlerins viendront, penseurs religieux."
18937,INFLUENCE,Le monde méconnut l’homme mélodieux.
18938,INFLUENCE,
18939,INFLUENCE,"I pass over many sonnets, and divers other poems, in which the"
18940,INFLUENCE,"influence of Wordsworth is unmistakable, and come to a last quotation"
18941,INFLUENCE,which is useful to elucidate an allusion in Wordsworth’s _The Poet’s
18942,INFLUENCE,"Dream: Sequel to the Norman Boy_. In this poem, written in 1842,"
18943,INFLUENCE,Wordsworth says--
18944,INFLUENCE,
18945,INFLUENCE,"But oh! that Country-man of thine, whose eye, loved Child, can see"
18946,INFLUENCE,"A pledge of endless bliss in acts of early piety,"
18947,INFLUENCE,"In verse, which to thy ear might come, would treat this simple theme,"
18948,INFLUENCE,Nor leave untold our happy flight in that adventurous dream.
18949,INFLUENCE,
18950,INFLUENCE,"As Wordsworth read very little French poetry in his old age, I think he"
18951,INFLUENCE,"here alludes to a poem of his admirer De la Morvonnais, who very likely"
18952,INFLUENCE,"sent him that _Thébaïde des Grèves_ (1838), in which Wordsworth was so"
18953,INFLUENCE,"highly praised. The passage alluded to is taken from “Solitude,” and"
18954,INFLUENCE,reads thus--
18955,INFLUENCE,
18956,INFLUENCE,"Enfant, Il (Dieu) te promet le domaine de l’ange"
18957,INFLUENCE,"Si tu gardes l’amour et la foi des aïeux,"
18958,INFLUENCE,"Et sa mère, aujourd’hui loin de l’humaine fange,"
18959,INFLUENCE,Que tu n’as pas connue et qui t’attend aux cieux.
18960,INFLUENCE,
18961,INFLUENCE,"As a whole, De la Morvonnais, though he imitates Wordsworth, is very"
18962,INFLUENCE,"unlike him. Of course I do not mean to compare the two, but even"
18963,INFLUENCE,"in like subjects he differs from Wordsworth, owing to a sort of"
18964,INFLUENCE,constitutional nervousness and brooding melancholy.[586]
