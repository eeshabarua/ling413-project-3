122,HOPE AND FEAR,"Beneath the shadow of dawn's aerial cope,"
123,HOPE AND FEAR,"With eyes enkindled as the sun's own sphere,"
124,HOPE AND FEAR,Hope from the front of youth in godlike cheer
125,HOPE AND FEAR,"Looks Godward, past the shades where blind men grope"
126,HOPE AND FEAR,"Round the dark door that prayers nor dreams can ope,"
127,HOPE AND FEAR,And makes for joy the very darkness dear
128,HOPE AND FEAR,That gives her wide wings play; nor dreams that fear
129,HOPE AND FEAR,At noon may rise and pierce the heart of hope.
130,HOPE AND FEAR,"Then, when the soul leaves off to dream and yearn,"
131,HOPE AND FEAR,May truth first purge her eyesight to discern
132,HOPE AND FEAR,What once being known leaves time no power to appal;
133,HOPE AND FEAR,"Till youth at last, ere yet youth be not, learn"
134,HOPE AND FEAR,The kind wise word that falls from years that fall--

147,I,Straight from the sun's grave in the deep clear west
148,I,"A sweet strong wind blows, glad of life: and I,"
149,I,Under the soft keen stardawn whence the sky
150,I,"Takes life renewed, and all night's godlike breast"
151,I,"Palpitates, gradually revealed at rest"
152,I,"By growth and change of ardours felt on high,"
153,I,"Make onward, till the last flame fall and die"
154,I,And all the world by night's broad hand lie blest.
155,I,"Haply, meseems, as from that edge of death,"
156,I,"Whereon the day lies dark, a brightening breath"
157,I,"Blows more of benediction than the morn,"
158,I,So from the graves whereon grief gazing saith
159,I,That half our heart of life there lies forlorn
160,I,May light or breath at least of hope be born.

165,II,The wind was soft before the sunset fled:
166,II,"Now, while the cloud-enshrouded corpse of day"
167,II,Is lowered along a red funereal way
168,II,"Down to the dark that knows not white from red,"
169,II,"A clear sheer breeze against the night makes head,"
170,II,"Serene, but sure of life as ere a ray"
171,II,"Springs, or the dusk of dawn knows red from grey,"
172,II,Being as a soul that knows not quick from dead.
173,II,"From far beyond the sunset, far above,"
174,II,Full toward the starry soundless east it blows
175,II,"Bright as a child's breath breathing on a rose,"
176,II,Smooth to the sense as plume of any dove;
177,II,Till more and more as darkness grows and glows
178,II,Silence and night seem likest life and love.

183,III,If light of life outlive the set of sun
184,III,"That men call death and end of all things, then"
185,III,How should not that which life held best for men
186,III,"And proved most precious, though it seem undone"
187,III,"By force of death and woful victory won,"
188,III,"Be first and surest of revival, when"
189,III,Death shall bow down to life arisen again?
190,III,So shall the soul seen be the self-same one
191,III,That looked and spake with even such lips and eyes
192,III,"As love shall doubt not then to recognise,"
193,III,And all bright thoughts and smiles of all time past
194,III,"Revive, transfigured, but in spirit and sense"
195,III,"None other than we knew, for evidence"
196,III,That love's last mortal word was not his last.
