31,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,_To the
32,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,Gentle Reader_
33,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,
34,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,
35,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,_As often as I pass a little Blue-coat boy I gaze upon him lovingly:
36,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,I reverence the quaint vision of a bygone age called up by the long
37,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"blue gaberdine, the red leathern belt, the yellow stockings--a quaint"
38,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"monkish figure still to be seen in crowded London streets, still adding"
39,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,to their picturesqueness and ever-varying charm._
40,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,
41,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"_You, too, dear Reader, have yourself probably asked the meaning of"
42,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"the strange sight, as you have passed one of these English lads so"
43,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"strangely attired. Perhaps you have been shown the famous old school,"
44,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"in the midst of the bustle of London, surrounded by ugly warehouses,"
45,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"offices, and shops; and you have seen the effigy of the Founder, “that"
46,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"godly and royal child, King Edward the Sixth, the flower of the Tudor"
47,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,name--the young flower that was untimely cropped as it began to fill
48,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,our land with its early odours--the boy-patron of boys--the serious and
49,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,holy child who walked with Cranmer and Ridley.”_
50,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,
51,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"_Alas, London is no longer to be the home of these boys, and the"
52,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"cloisters of the Old Grey Friars will soon moulder away, when the merry"
53,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,noise of sports and revels cease to awaken them to life._
54,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,
55,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,_As I looked through the bars the other day watching the boys at their
56,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"games, a strange fancy came to me. I thought I saw a pale and studious"
57,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"“Grecian” (as they call the head boys of the school), and walking at"
58,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"his side, with glittering eyes full of wonderment, was a younger lad--a"
59,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"boy with crisply curling black hair, and with ruddy brown complexion,"
60,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"and in his look so much lovableness and trustfulness, that I felt"
61,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"myself envying the elder lad, whose hand rested so affectionately on"
62,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,the shoulder of his friend. I drew near to listen to their talk. The
63,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,thoughtful Grecian was discoursing learnedly yet so sweetly about some
64,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"deep matter of philosophy: it seemed somewhat beyond the younger boy,"
65,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"but he listened quietly, rapt in admiration. Suddenly the school-bell"
66,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"sounded. “Hurry on, Charles! ‘’Mid deepest meditation sounds the"
67,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,knell.’ That’s how your good old Elizabethans would put it. We’ll have
68,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,another talk after supper.” “I--I’ve n--not h--h--had o--one t--t--talk
69,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"y--yet, S ... T ... C,” stammered the other in reply: a painful"
70,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,contrast to the sublime eloquence that flowed from his companion._
71,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,
72,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,_The noise of the bell and scampering of the boys soon made me realise
73,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"that Fancy had led me back a hundred years and more, and had given me a"
74,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"glimpse of the boyhood of two famous Englishmen, who have added glory"
75,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"to their ancient school--Samuel Taylor Coleridge, poet and philosopher,"
76,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"and Charles Lamb, essayist and critic, the best beloved of all the good"
77,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,and great men whose writings are dear to us._
78,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,
79,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"_Some day you will read the story of the lives of these two men, and"
80,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"you will love their books,--the weird and fairy poetry of Coleridge,"
81,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,recalling a dreamy youth reared amid the woodlands of Devon--the
82,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"genial and sweet essays of Lamb, so full of gentle humour, and"
83,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"kindliness, and humanity, so rich in tender thoughts concerning all his"
84,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"fellow-creatures in the great city where he was born and bred, which he"
85,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,loved passionately. To London he had given “his heart and his love in
86,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"childhood and in boyhood,” and throughout his life his heart was filled"
87,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,with “fulness of joy at the multitudinous scenes of life in the crowded
88,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,streets of ever dear London.”_
89,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,
90,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"_Charles Lamb’s Essays are among the greatest of our treasures, but"
91,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,even more beautiful than his writings is the record of his noble
92,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"life--a life of saintly self-sacrifice, cheerfully devoted to the"
93,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"guardianship of a lonely sister, whose girlhood would have been spent"
94,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,in loveless solitude but for her brother’s love. Mary Lamb’s tragic
95,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,story (too sad to be told here) was illumined by the light of this
96,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,brotherly love which shone forth when the world was very dark and
97,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,gloomy._
98,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,
99,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,_Mary Lamb had something of her brother’s gift of writing; it was
100,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,she indeed to whom you owe many of the Tales of Shakespeare you are
101,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"so fond of. They loved children, and they loved Shakespeare, and"
102,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,their stories from Shakespeare have been and are still read by boys
103,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"and girls all the world over. They wrote, too, a whole collection of"
104,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"Poetry for Children, and here also Mary’s share was much greater than"
105,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"her brother’s. “Mine,” wrote Charles, “are but one-third in quantity"
106,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"of the whole.” ... “Perhaps you will admire the number of subjects,"
107,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"all of children, picked out by an old bachelor and an old maid. Many"
108,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,parents would not have found so many.” This collection of “Poetry for
109,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"Children” in two small volumes, was so much liked by the children that"
110,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"all the copies were soon bought up, and Charles Lamb himself could not"
111,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"get a copy, when later in life he sought one far and wide. So rare is"
112,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"the book now that only one or two copies are known to exist, and even"
113,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,the British Museum does not possess these precious little volumes. A
114,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,small selection of the poems are now once again offered to boys and
115,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"girls: if this prove welcome, more will follow. They are simple little"
116,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"poems such as children should care for, and even grown-up people, for"
117,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"whom they were never intended, cherish every word written by Mary and"
118,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"Charles Lamb, because they know how much goodness and humility dwelt in"
119,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,their souls. If there were any wish to be learned and to explain how
120,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"they came to write these verses, one would have to tell you something"
121,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"about other writers who were then living and writing, more especially"
122,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"about Lamb’s friend “S. T. C.,” who, together with an even greater"
123,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"poet, William Wordsworth, had published ten years before, in 1798, a"
124,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"small volume of simple English poems, which was destined to have the"
125,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,greatest influence on English poetry for long years to come. In that
126,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,volume Wordsworth first printed the sweet little poem I am sure you
127,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"know, called_ We Are Seven, _and Coleridge, “the inspired charity boy,”"
128,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"as Charles Lamb called him, gave the world the magical ballad of_ The"
129,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,Ancient Mariner. _One verse from this ballad ought to be printed on the
130,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,title-page of this little book of poems by Mary and Charles Lamb:--_
131,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,
132,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"_“He prayeth best, who loveth best"
133,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,All things both great and small;
134,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,"For the dear God who loveth us,"
135,ISRAEL GOLLANCZ,He made and loveth all.”_

241,SISTER,"I have got a double row,"
242,SISTER,All as white and all as small;
243,SISTER,Yet no one cares for mine at all.
244,SISTER,"He can say but half a word,"
245,SISTER,Yet that single sound’s preferr’d
246,SISTER,To all the words that I can say
247,SISTER,In the longest summer day.
248,SISTER,He cannot walk; yet if he put
249,SISTER,"With mimic motion out his foot,"
250,SISTER,"As if he thought he were advancing,"
251,SISTER,It’s prized more than my best dancing.

267,BROTHER,There was not a tooth of those

294,II,"You think you can conceal it,"

299,II,"Richard this saying oft had heard,"
300,II,Until the sight of any bird
301,II,Would set his heart a-quaking;
302,II,He saw a host of winged spies
303,II,"For ever o’er him in the skies,"

324,II,When we with pain suppress it;

326,II,"Would raise a pang, it had not force"
327,II,To make him yet confess it.
328,II,
329,II,"When on a day, as he abroad"
330,II,"Walk’d by his mother, in their road"
331,II,He heard a skylark singing;
332,II,"Smit with the sound, a flood of tears"

334,II,His inmost bosom wringing.
335,II,
336,II,"His mother, wondering, saw him cry,"
337,II,And fondly ask’d the reason why?
338,II,"Then Richard made confession,"
339,II,"And said, he fear’d the little bird"
340,II,He singing in the air had heard
341,II,Was telling his transgression.
342,II,
343,II,"The words which Richard spoke below,"
344,II,"As sounds by nature upwards go,"
345,II,Were to the skylark carried:
346,II,"The airy traveller with surprise,"
347,II,"To hear his sayings, in the skies"
348,II,On his mid-journey tarried.

354,II,As what this little son of earth
355,II,Hath in his grossness mutter’d.
356,II,
357,II,“Dull fool! to think we sons of air
358,II,"On man’s low actions waste a care,"
359,II,His virtues or his vices;
360,II,Or soaring on the summer gales
361,II,That we should stoop to carry tales
362,II,Of him or his devices!
363,II,
364,II,“Mistaken fool! man needs not us
365,II,"His secret merits to discuss,"
366,II,Or spy out his transgression;

368,II,That voice within him is the _bird_
369,II,That moves him to confession.”

599,VII,"Which form the petition we call The Lord’s Prayer,"
600,VII,And now let me help my dear child to discover
601,VII,The meaning of all the good words that are there.
602,VII,
603,VII,"“Our Father,” the same appellation is given"
604,VII,"To a parent on earth, and a Parent of all,"
605,VII,O gracious permission! the God that’s in heaven
606,VII,Allows His poor creatures Him Father to call.
607,VII,
608,VII,To “hallow His name” is to think with devotion
609,VII,"Of it, and with reverence mention the same;"
610,VII,"Though you are so young, you should strive for some notion"
611,VII,Of the awe we should feel at the Holy One’s name.
612,VII,
613,VII,"His “will done on earth, as it is done in heaven,”"
614,VII,"Is a wish and a hope we are suffer’d to breathe,"
615,VII,"That such grace and favour to us may be given,"
616,VII,Like good angels on high we may live here beneath.
617,VII,
618,VII,"“Our daily bread give us,” your young apprehension"
619,VII,"May well understand, is to pray for our food;"
620,VII,"Although we ask bread, and no other thing mention,"
621,VII,God’s bounty gives all things sufficient and good.
622,VII,
623,VII,"You pray that your “trespasses may be forgiven,"
624,VII,As you forgive those that are done unto you.”
625,VII,"Before this you say to the God that’s in heaven,"
626,VII,Consider the words which you speak--are they true?
627,VII,
628,VII,If any one has in the past time offended
629,VII,"Us angry creatures, who soon take offence,"
630,VII,These words in the prayer are surely intended
631,VII,"To soften our minds, and expel wrath from thence."
632,VII,
633,VII,[Illustration]
634,VII,
635,VII,"We pray that “temptations may never assail us,”"
636,VII,"And “deliverance beg from all evil,” we find:"
637,VII,"But we never can hope that our prayer will avail us,"
638,VII,If we strive not to banish ill thoughts from our mind.
639,VII,
640,VII,"“For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory,"
641,VII,"For ever and ever,” these titles are meant"
642,VII,To express God’s dominion and majesty o’er ye;

1124,XVII,"Margaret was tall and fair,"
1125,XVII,Martha shorter by a hair;
1126,XVII,"If the first excell’d in feature,"
1127,XVII,The other’s grace and ease were greater;
1128,XVII,"Mary, though to rival loth,"
1129,XVII,In their best gifts equall’d both.
1130,XVII,They a due proportion kept;
1131,XVII,Martha mourn’d if Margaret wept;
1132,XVII,Margaret joy’d when any good
1133,XVII,She of Martha understood;
1134,XVII,And in sympathy for either
1135,XVII,Mary was outdone by neither.
1136,XVII,"Thus far, for a happy space,"
1137,XVII,"All three ran an even race,"
1138,XVII,"A most constant friendship proving,"
1139,XVII,Equally beloved and loving;
1140,XVII,"All their wishes, joys, the same,"
1141,XVII,Sisters only not in name.
1142,XVII,
1143,XVII,Fortune upon each one smiled
1144,XVII,As upon a favourite child;
1145,XVII,Well to do and well to see
1146,XVII,Were the parents of all three;
1147,XVII,Till on Martha’s father crosses
1148,XVII,"Brought a flood of worldly losses,"
1149,XVII,And his fortunes rich and great
1150,XVII,Changed at once to low estate;
1151,XVII,Under which o’erwhelming blow
1152,XVII,Martha’s mother was laid low;
1153,XVII,"She a hapless orphan left,"
1154,XVII,"Of maternal care bereft,"
1155,XVII,"Trouble following trouble fast,"
1156,XVII,Lay in a sick bed at last.
1157,XVII,
1158,XVII,In the depth of her affliction
1159,XVII,Martha now received conviction
1160,XVII,That a true and faithful friend
1161,XVII,Can the surest comfort lend.
1162,XVII,"Night and day, with friendship tried,"
1163,XVII,Ever constant by her side
1164,XVII,"Was her gentle Mary found,"
1165,XVII,With a love that knew no bound;

1167,XVII,Saved her dying broken-hearted.

1171,XVII,That which had to Martha proved

1175,XVII,"She, whose love was not less dear,"
1176,XVII,"Nor affection less sincere,"
1177,XVII,"To her friend, was by occasion"

1179,XVII,"Fewer visits forced to pay her,"
1180,XVII,When no other cause did stay her;
1181,XVII,"And her Mary living nearer,"
1182,XVII,Margaret began to fear her

1184,XVII,Martha’s heart should steal away.
1185,XVII,That whole heart she ill could spare her
1186,XVII,Where till now she’d been a sharer.
1187,XVII,"From this cause with grief she pined,"
1188,XVII,Till at length her health declined.
1189,XVII,"All her cheerful spirits flew,"
1190,XVII,Fast as Martha gather’d new;
1191,XVII,"And her sickness waxed sore,"
1192,XVII,Just when Martha felt no more.

1194,XVII,[Illustration]

1199,XVII,"Less demanded now her presence,"
1200,XVII,"With a goodness built on reason,"
1201,XVII,"Changed her measures with the season,"
1202,XVII,"Turn’d her steps from Martha’s door,"
1203,XVII,Went where she was wanted more;
1204,XVII,All her care and thoughts were set
1205,XVII,Now to tend on Margaret.
1206,XVII,"Mary living ’twixt the two,"
1207,XVII,From her home could oftener go
1208,XVII,Either of her friends to see
1209,XVII,Than they could together be.
1210,XVII,
1211,XVII,Truth explain’d is to suspicion

1213,XVII,Soon her visits had the effect;
1214,XVII,All that Margaret did suspect
1215,XVII,From her fancy vanish’d clean;
1216,XVII,"She was soon what she had been,"
1217,XVII,And the colour she did lack
1218,XVII,"To her faded cheek came back,"

1220,XVII,Love alone had power to heal.
1221,XVII,
1222,XVII,"Martha, who the frequent visit"
1223,XVII,"Now had lost, and sore did miss it,"
1224,XVII,"With impatience waxed cross,"
1225,XVII,Counted Margaret’s gain her loss:
1226,XVII,All that Mary did confer
1227,XVII,"On her friend, thought due to her."
1228,XVII,In her girlish bosom rise
1229,XVII,"Little foolish jealousies,"
1230,XVII,"Which into such rancour wrought,"
1231,XVII,She one day for Margaret sought;
1232,XVII,"Finding her by chance alone,"
1233,XVII,"She began, with reasons shown,"
1234,XVII,To insinuate a fear
1235,XVII,Whether Mary was sincere;
1236,XVII,Wish’d that Margaret would take heed
1237,XVII,Whence her actions did proceed.
1238,XVII,"For herself, she’d long been minded"
1239,XVII,Not with outsides to be blinded;
1240,XVII,"All that pity and compassion,"
1241,XVII,She believed was affectation;
1242,XVII,In her heart she doubted whether
1243,XVII,Mary cared a pin for either.
1244,XVII,She could keep whole weeks at distance
1245,XVII,"And not know of their existence,"
1246,XVII,While all things remain’d the same;
1247,XVII,"But when some misfortune came,"
1248,XVII,Then she made a great parade
1249,XVII,
1250,XVII,[Illustration]
1251,XVII,
1252,XVII,"Of her sympathy and aid,--"
1253,XVII,"Not that she did really grieve,"
1254,XVII,"It was only _make-believe_,"
1255,XVII,"And she cared for nothing, so"
1256,XVII,"She might her fine feelings show,"
1257,XVII,And get credit on her part
1258,XVII,For a soft and tender heart.
1259,XVII,
1260,XVII,"With such speeches, smoothly made,"
1261,XVII,She found methods to persuade
1262,XVII,"Margaret (who, being sore"
1263,XVII,"From the doubts she’d felt before,"
1264,XVII,Was prepared for mistrust)
1265,XVII,To believe her reasons just;
1266,XVII,Quite destroyed that comfort glad
1267,XVII,Which in Mary late she had;
1268,XVII,"Made her, in experience’ spite,"
1269,XVII,"Think her friend a hypocrite,"
1270,XVII,"And resolve, with cruel scoff,"
1271,XVII,To renounce and cast her off.
1272,XVII,
1273,XVII,See how good turns are rewarded!
1274,XVII,"She of both is now discarded,"

1276,XVII,"Their support in low estate,"
1277,XVII,"All their comfort, and their stay--"
1278,XVII,Now of both is cast away.
1279,XVII,"But the league her presence cherished,"
1280,XVII,"Losing its best prop, soon perished;"
1281,XVII,"She, that was a link to either,"
1282,XVII,"To keep them and it together,"
1283,XVII,"Being gone, the two (no wonder)"
1284,XVII,That were left soon fell asunder;--
1285,XVII,"Some civilities were kept,"
1286,XVII,But the heart of friendship slept;
1287,XVII,"Love with hollow forms was fed,"
1288,XVII,But the life of love lay dead:--
1289,XVII,A cold intercourse they held
1290,XVII,After Mary was expelled.
1291,XVII,
1292,XVII,Two long years did intervene
1293,XVII,"Since they’d either of them seen,"
1294,XVII,"Or by letter, any word"
1295,XVII,"Of their old companion heard,--"
1296,XVII,"When, upon a day once walking,"
1297,XVII,"Of indifferent matters talking,"
1298,XVII,They a female figure met;--
1299,XVII,"Martha said to Margaret,"
1300,XVII,“That young maid in face does carry
1301,XVII,"A resemblance strong of Mary,”"
1302,XVII,"Margaret, at nearer sight,"
1303,XVII,Own’d her observation right;
1304,XVII,But they did not far proceed
1305,XVII,Ere they found ’twas she indeed.
1306,XVII,"She--but, ah! I how changed they view her"
1307,XVII,From that person which they knew her!
1308,XVII,"Her fine face disease had scarr’d,"
1309,XVII,And its matchless beauty marr’d:--
1310,XVII,But enough was left to trace
1311,XVII,Mary’s sweetness--Mary’s grace.
1312,XVII,"When her eye did first behold them,"
1313,XVII,How they blush’d! but when she told them
1314,XVII,How on a sick bed she lay
1315,XVII,"Months, while they had kept away"
1316,XVII,And had no inquiries made
1317,XVII,If she were alive or dead;--
1318,XVII,"How, for want of a true friend,"
1319,XVII,"She was brought near to her end,"
1320,XVII,And was like so to have died
1321,XVII,With no friend at her bedside;--
1322,XVII,How the constant irritation
1323,XVII,Caused by fruitless expectation
1324,XVII,"Of their coming, had extended"
1325,XVII,"The illness, when she might have mended,--"
1326,XVII,"Then, O then, how did reflection"
1327,XVII,Come on them with recollection!
1328,XVII,"All that she had done for them,"
1329,XVII,How it did their fault condemn!
1330,XVII,
1331,XVII,"But sweet Mary, still the same,"
1332,XVII,Kindly eased them of their shame;
1333,XVII,"Spoke to them with accents bland,"
1334,XVII,Took them friendly by the hand;
1335,XVII,Bound them both with promise fast
1336,XVII,Not to speak of troubles past;
1337,XVII,Made them on the spot declare
1338,XVII,A new league of friendship there;
1339,XVII,"Which, without a word of strife,"
1340,XVII,Lasted thenceforth long as life.
1341,XVII,Martha now and Margaret
