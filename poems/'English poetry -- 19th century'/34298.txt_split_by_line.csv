154,I.,I.
155,I.,
156,I.,"O'er royal London, in luxuriant May,"
157,I.,"While lamps yet twinkled, dawning crept the day."
158,I.,Home from the hell the pale-eyed gamester steals;
159,I.,Home from the ball flash jaded Beauty's wheels;
160,I.,"The lean grimalkin, who, since night began,"
161,I.,"Hath hymn'd to love amidst the wrath of man,"
162,I.,"Scared from his raptures by the morning star,"
163,I.,"Flits finely by, and threads the area bar;"
164,I.,From fields suburban rolls the early cart;
165,I.,"As rests the revel, so awakes the mart."
166,I.,"Transfusing Mocha from the beans within,"
167,I.,"Bright by the crossing gleams the alchemic tin,--"
168,I.,"There halts the craftsman; there, with envious sigh,"
169,I.,"The houseless vagrant looks, and limps foot-weary by."
170,I.,
171,I.,"Behold that street,--the Omphalos of Town!"
172,I.,"Where the grim palace wears the prison's frown,"
173,I.,"As mindful still, amidst a gaudier race,"
174,I.,Of the veil'd Genius of the mournful Place--
175,I.,"Of floors no majesty but Griefs had trod,"
176,I.,And weary limbs that only knelt to God.[A]
177,I.,
178,I.,"What tales, what morals, of the elder day--"
179,I.,If stones had language--could that street convey!
180,I.,Why yell the human bloodhounds panting there?--
181,I.,To drown the Stuart's last forgiving prayer.[B]
182,I.,Again the bloodhounds!--whither would they run?
183,I.,To lick the feet of Stuart's ribald son.
184,I.,"There, through the dusk-red towers, amidst his ring"
185,I.,"Of Vans and Mynheers, rode the Dutchman king;"
186,I.,And there--did England's Goneril thrill to hear
187,I.,The shouts that triumph'd o'er her crownless Lear?
188,I.,"There, where the gaslight streams on Crockford's door,"
189,I.,Bluff Henry chuckled at the jests of More;
190,I.,"There, where you gaze upon the last H. B.,"
191,I.,"Swift paused, and mutter'd, ""Shall I have that see?"""
192,I.,"There, where yon pile, for party's common weal,"
193,I.,"Knits votes that serve, with hearts abhorring, Peel,"
194,I.,"Blunt Walpole seized, and roughly bought, his man;--"
195,I.,"Or, tired of Polly, St. John lounged to Anne."
196,I.,"Well, let the world change on,--still must endure"
197,I.,"While Earth is Earth, one changeless race--the Poor!"
198,I.,"Within that street, on yonder threshold stone,"
199,I.,"What sits as stone-like?--Penury, claim thine own!"
200,I.,"She sate, the homeless wanderer,--with calm eyes"
201,I.,"Looking through tears, yet lifted to the skies;"
202,I.,"Wistful, but patient, sorrowful, but mild,"
203,I.,As asking God when He would claim his child.
204,I.,A face too youthful for so hush'd a grief;--
205,I.,The worm that gnaw'd the core had spared the leaf;
206,I.,"Though worn the cheek, with hunger, or with care,"
207,I.,Yet still the soft fresh childlike bloom was there;
208,I.,"And each might touch you with an equal gloom,"
209,I.,"The youth, the care, the hunger, and the bloom;--"
210,I.,"As if, when round the cradle of the child"
211,I.,"With lavish gifts the gentler fairies smiled,"
212,I.,"One vengeful sprite, forgotten as the guest,"
213,I.,"Had breathed a spell to disenchant the rest,"
214,I.,"And prove how slight each favour, else divine,"
215,I.,If wroth the Urganda of the Golden Mine!
216,I.,
217,I.,"Now, as the houseless sate, and up the sky"
218,I.,"Dawn to day strengthen'd, pass'd a stranger by:"
219,I.,He saw and halted;--she beheld him not--
220,I.,"All round them slept, and silence wrapt the spot."
221,I.,To this new-comer Nature had denied
222,I.,The gifts that graced the outcast crouch'd beside:
223,I.,"With orient suns his cheek was swarth and grim,"
224,I.,"And low the form, though lightly shaped the limb;"
225,I.,"Yet life glow'd vigorous in that deep-set eye,"
226,I.,With a calm force that dared you to defy;
227,I.,And the strong foot was planted on the stone
228,I.,Firm as a gnome's upon his mountain throne;
229,I.,"Simple his garb, yet what the wealthy wear,"
230,I.,And conscious power gave lordship to his air.
231,I.,
232,I.,Lone in the Babel thus the maid and man;
233,I.,"Long he gazed silent, and at last began:"
234,I.,"""Poor homeless outcast--dost thou see me stand"
235,I.,"Close by thy side, yet beg not? Stretch thy hand."""
236,I.,"The voice was stern, abrupt, yet full and deep:"
237,I.,"The outcast heard, and started as from sleep,"
238,I.,"And meekly rose, and stretch'd the hand and sought"
239,I.,To murmur thanks--the murmur fail'd the thought.
240,I.,He took the slight thin hand within his own:
241,I.,"""This hand hath nought of honest labour known;"
242,I.,"And yet methinks thou'rt honest!--speak, my child."""
243,I.,And his face broke to beauty as it smiled.
244,I.,"But her unconscious eyes, cast down the while,"
245,I.,Met not the heart that open'd in the smile:
246,I.,"Again the murmur rose, and died in air."
247,I.,"""Nay, what thy mother and her home, and where?"""
248,I.,"Lo, with those words, the rigid ice that lay"
249,I.,"Layer upon layer within, dissolves away,"
250,I.,And tears come rushing from o'erchargèd eyes:--
251,I.,"""There is my mother--there her home--the skies!"""
252,I.,"Oh, in that burst, what depth of lone distress!"
253,I.,O desolation of the motherless!
254,I.,"Yet through the anguish how survived the trust,"
255,I.,"Home in the skies, though in the grave the dust!"
256,I.,"The man was moved, and silence fell again;"
257,I.,Upsprung the sun--Light re-assumed the reign;--
258,I.,"Love ruled on high! Below, the twain that share"
259,I.,Men's builded empires--Mammon and Despair!
260,I.,
261,I.,"At length, with pitying eye and soothing tone,"
262,I.,"The stranger spoke: ""Thy bitterer grief mine own;"
263,I.,"Amidst the million, lonely as thou art,"
264,I.,"Mine the full coffers, but the beggar'd heart."
265,I.,"Yet Gold--earth's demon, when unshared, receives"
266,I.,"God's breath, and grows a god, when it relieves."
267,I.,"Trust still our common Father, orphan one,"
268,I.,"And He shall guide thee, if thou trust the son."
269,I.,"Nay, follow, child."" And on with passive feet,"
270,I.,Ghost-like she follow'd through the death-like street.
271,I.,They paused at last a stately pile before;
272,I.,The drowsy porter oped the noiseless door;
273,I.,The girl stood wistful still without;--the pause
274,I.,"The guide divined, and thus rebuked the cause:--"
275,I.,"""Enter, no tempter let thy penury fear;"
276,I.,"I have a sister, and her home is here."""

280,II.,
281,II.,And who the wanderer that hath shelter won
282,II.,Beneath the roof of Fortune's favour'd son?
283,II.,"Ill stars predoom'd her, and she stole to birth"
284,II.,"Fresh from the Heaven,--Law's outcast on the earth;"
285,II.,"The child of Love betraying and betray'd,"
286,II.,The blossom open'd in the Upas shade;--
287,II.,"So ran the rumour; if the rumour lied,"
288,II.,"The humble mother wept, but not denied:"
289,II.,Ne'er had the infant's slumber known a rest
290,II.,On childhood's native shield--a father's breast.
291,II.,"Dead or neglectful, 'twas to her the same;                }"
292,II.,"But, oh, how dear!--yea, dearer for the shame,            }"
293,II.,All that God hallows in a mother's name!                  }
294,II.,"Here, one proud refuge from a world's disdain,"
295,II.,Here the lost empress half resumes her reign;--
296,II.,Here the deep-fallen Eve sees Eden's skies
297,II.,Smile on the desert from the cherub's eyes.
298,II.,Sweet to each human heart the right to love;
299,II.,But 'tis the deluge consecrates the dove;
300,II.,"And haply scorn yet more the child endears,"
301,II.,"Cradled in misery, and baptized with tears."
302,II.,
303,II.,"Each then the all on earth unto the other,--"
304,II.,The sinless infant and the erring mother:
305,II.,"The one soon lost the smile which childhood wears,"
306,II.,Chill'd by the gloom it marvels at--but shares;
307,II.,"The other, by that purest love made pure,"
308,II.,"Learn'd to redeem, by labouring to endure;"
309,II.,Who can divine what hidden music lies
310,II.,"In the frail reed, till winds awake its sighs?"
311,II.,
312,II.,"Hard was their life, and lonely was their hearth;"
313,II.,"There, kindness brought no holiday of mirth;"
314,II.,"No kindred visited, no playmate came;--"
315,II.,"Joy, the proud worldling, shunn'd the child of shame!"
316,II.,"Yet in the lesson which, at stolen whiles,"
317,II.,"'Twixt care and care, the respite-hour beguiles,"
318,II.,The mother's mind the polish'd trace betrays              }
319,II.,Of early culture and serener days;                        }
320,II.,And gentle birth still moulds the delicate phrase.        }
321,II.,"By converse, more than books (for books too poor),"
322,II.,Learn'd Lucy more than books themselves insure;
323,II.,"For if, in truth, the mother's heart had err'd,"
324,II.,"Pure now the life, and holy was the word:"
325,II.,The fallen state no grov'ling change had wrought;
326,II.,"Meek if the bearing, lofty was the thought;"
327,II.,"So much of noble in the lore instill'd,"
328,II.,You felt the soul had ne'er the error will'd;--
329,II.,That fraud alone had duped its wings astray
330,II.,From their true instinct tow'rds empyreal day.
331,II.,"Thus life itself, if sadd'ning, still refined,"
332,II.,And through the heart the culture reach'd the mind.
333,II.,"As to the moon the tides attracted move,"
334,II.,So flow'd the intellect beneath the love.--
335,II.,"To nurse the sickness, to assuage the care,"
336,II.,To charm the sigh into the happier prayer;
337,II.,Forestall the unutter'd wish with ready guess;
338,II.,Wise in the exquisite tact of tenderness!
339,II.,"These Lucy's study;--and, in grateful looks,"
340,II.,Seraphs write lessons more divine than books.
341,II.,
342,II.,"So dawn'd her youth:--Youth, Nature's holiday!"
343,II.,"Fair time, which dreams so gently steal away;"
344,II.,"When Life--dark volume, with its opening leaf"
345,II.,"Of Joy,--through fable dupes us into grief--"
346,II.,Tells of a golden Arcady;--and then
347,II.,"Read on,--comes truth;--the Iron world of men!"
348,II.,But from her life thy opening poet page
349,II.,Was torn!--Its record had no Golden Age.
350,II.,
351,II.,"Behold her by the couch, on bended knees!"
352,II.,There the wan mother--there the last disease!
353,II.,"Dread to the poor the least suspense of health,--"
354,II.,"Their hands their friends, their labour all their wealth:"
355,II.,"Let the wheel rest from toil a single sun,"
356,II.,And all the humble clock-work is undone.
357,II.,"The custom lost, the drain upon the hoard,"
358,II.,"The debt that sweeps the fragment from the board,"
359,II.,"How mark the hunger round thee, and be brave--"
360,II.,"Foresee thy orphan, and not fear the grave?"
361,II.,Lower and ever lower in the grade
362,II.,"Of penury fell the mother and the maid,"
363,II.,"Till the grim close; when, as the midnight rain"
364,II.,"Drove to the pallet through the broken pane,"
365,II.,"The dying murmur'd: ""Near,--thy hand,--more near!"
366,II.,"I am not what scorn deem'd,--yet not severe"
367,II.,"The doom which leaves me, in the hour of death,"
368,II.,The right to bless thee with my parting breath--
369,II.,"These, worn till now, wear thou, his daughter. Live"
370,II.,"To see thy sire, and tell him--I forgive!"""
371,II.,Cold the child thrills beneath the hands that press
372,II.,Her bended neck--slow slackens the caress--
373,II.,Loud the roof rattles with the stormy gust;
374,II.,"The grief is silent, and the love is dust;"
375,II.,From the spent fuel God's bright spark is flown;
376,II.,"And there the Motherless, and Death--alone!"
377,II.,
378,II.,Then fell a happy darkness o'er the mind;--
379,II.,"That trance, that pause, the tempest leaves behind:"
380,II.,"Still, with a timid step, around she crept,"
381,II.,"And sigh'd, ""She sleeps!"" and smiled. Too well she slept!"
382,II.,Dark strangers enter'd in the squalid cell;
383,II.,Rude hirelings placed the pauper in the shell;
384,II.,Harsh voices question'd of the name and age;
385,II.,Ev'n paupers live upon the parish page.
386,II.,"She answers not, or sighs, and smiles, and keeps"
387,II.,"The same meek language:--""Hush! my mother sleeps."""
388,II.,"They thrust some scanty pence into her palm,"
389,II.,"And led her forth, scarce marv'ling at her calm;"
390,II.,"And bade her work, not beg--be good, and shun"
391,II.,"All bad companions--so their work was done,"
392,II.,And the wreck left to drift amidst the roar
393,II.,Of the Great Ocean with the rocky shore.
394,II.,
395,II.,And thou hast found the shelter!--from thine eyes
396,II.,Melt the long shadows. Dawn is in the skies.
397,II.,"Low on the earth, while Night endures,--unguess'd"
398,II.,Hope folds the wing and slumbers on its nest;
399,II.,Let but a sunbeam to the world be given--
400,II.,And hark--it singeth at the gates of Heaven!
401,II.,
402,II.,
403,III.,III.
404,III.,
405,III.,Yet o'er that house there hung a solemn gloom;
406,III.,"The step fell timid in each gorgeous room,"
407,III.,"Vast, sumptuous, dreary as some Eastern pile,"
408,III.,Where mutes keep watch--a home without a smile;
409,III.,"Still as if silence reign'd there, like a law,"
410,III.,And left to pomp no attribute but awe;
411,III.,Save when the swell of sombre festival
412,III.,"Jarr'd into joy the melancholy hall,"
413,III.,So some chance wind in mournful autumn wrings
414,III.,"Discordant notes, although from music-strings."
415,III.,"Wild were the wealthy master's moods and strange,"
416,III.,As one whose humour found its food in change;
417,III.,Now for whole days content apart to dwell
418,III.,With books and thought--his world the student's cell;
419,III.,"And now, with guests around the glittering board,"
420,III.,The hermit-Timon shone the Athenian lord.
421,III.,"There bloom'd the bright ephemerals of the hour,"
422,III.,"Whom the fierce ferment forces into flower,"
423,III.,"The gorgeous nurslings of the social life,"
424,III.,Sprung from our hotbeds--Vanity and Strife!
425,III.,"Lords of the senate, wrestlers for the state,"
426,III.,"Grey-hair'd in youth, exhausted, worn,--and great;"
427,III.,"Pale Book-men,--charming only in their style;"
428,III.,"And Poets, jaundiced with eternal bile;--"
429,III.,"All the poor Titans our Cocytus claims,"
430,III.,"With tortured livers, and immortal names:--"
431,III.,"Such made the guests, Amphitryons well may boast,"
432,III.,But still the student travail'd in the host;--
433,III.,"These were the living books he loved to read,"
434,III.,"Keys to his lore, and comments on his creed."
435,III.,From them he rose with more confirm'd disdain
436,III.,Of the thorn-chaplet and the gilded chain.
437,III.,"Oft, from such stately revels, to the shed"
438,III.,"Where Hunger couch'd, the same dark impulse led;"
439,III.,"Intent, the Babel, Art has built, to trace,"
440,III.,"Here scan the height, and there explore the base;"
441,III.,"That structure call'd ""The Civilized,"" as vain"
442,III.,"As its old symbol on the Shinar plain,"
443,III.,"Where Pride collects the bricks and slime, and then"
444,III.,But builds the city to divide the men;
445,III.,"Swift comes the antique curse,--smites one from one,"
446,III.,"Rends the great bond, and leaves the pile undone."
447,III.,
448,III.,Man will _o'er muse_--when musing on mankind:
449,III.,"The vast expanse defeats the searching mind,"
450,III.,Blent in one mass each varying height and hue:--
451,III.,"Wouldst thou seize Nature, Artist?--bound the view!"
452,III.,"But He, in truth, is banish'd from the ties"
453,III.,"That curb the ardent, and content the wise;"
454,III.,"From the pent heart the bubbling passions sweep,"
455,III.,To spread in aimless circles o'er the deep.
456,III.,
457,III.,Still in extremes--in each was still betray'd
458,III.,A soul at discord with the part it play'd;
459,III.,"A soul in social elements misplaced,"
460,III.,"Bruised by the grate and yearning for the waste,"
461,III.,"And wearing custom, as a pard the chain,"
462,III.,"Now with dull torpor, now with fierce disdain."
463,III.,
464,III.,"All who approach'd him by that spell were bound,"
465,III.,Which nobler natures weave themselves around:
466,III.,Those stars which make their own charm'd atmosphere;
467,III.,"Not wholly love, but yet more love than fear,"
468,III.,"A mystic influence, which, we know not why,"
469,III.,Makes some on earth seem portions of our sky.
470,III.,
471,III.,"In truth, our Morvale (such his name) could boast"
472,III.,Those kinglier virtues which subject us most;
473,III.,"The ear inclined to every voice of grief,"

477,III.,But sprang to man's warm instinct for mankind;            }
478,III.,"Honour, truth's life-sap, with pervading power"
479,III.,Nurturing the stem to crown it with the flower;
480,III.,And that true daring not alone to those
481,III.,Whom fault or fate has marshall'd into foes;
482,III.,But the rare valour that confronts with scorn
483,III.,"The monster shape, of Vice and Folly born,"
484,III.,"Which some ""the World,"" and some ""Opinion,"" call,"
485,III.,"Own'd by no heart, and yet enslaving all;"
486,III.,"The bastard charter of the social state,"
487,III.,Which crowns the base to ostracise the great;
488,III.,"The eternal quack upon the itinerant stage,"
489,III.,"This the ""good Public,"" that ""the enlighten'd Age,"""
490,III.,"Ready alike to worship and revile,"
491,III.,"To build the altar, or to light the pile;"
492,III.,"Now ""Down with Stuart and the Reign of Sin,"""
493,III.,"Now ""Long live Charles the Second and Nell Gwynne;"""
494,III.,"Now mad for patriots--hot for revolution,"
495,III.,Now all for hanging and the Constitution.
496,III.,"Honour to him, who, self-complete, if lone,"
497,III.,Carves to the grave one pathway all his own;
498,III.,"And, heeding nought that men may think or say,"
499,III.,Asks but his soul if doubtful of the way.
500,III.,
501,III.,
502,IV.,IV.
503,IV.,
504,IV.,Such was the better nature Morvale show'd;
505,IV.,Now view the contrast which the worse bestow'd.
506,IV.,"Large was his learning, yet so vague and mix'd"
507,IV.,It guided less the reason than unfix'd;
508,IV.,"The dauntless impulse and the kingly will,"
509,IV.,"Prompted to good, but leapt the checks to ill;"
510,IV.,"Quick in revenge, and passionately proud,"
511,IV.,"His brightest hour still shone forth from a cloud,"
512,IV.,And none conjecture on the next could form--
513,IV.,So play'd the sunbeam on the verge of storm.
514,IV.,
515,IV.,Still young--not youthful--life had pass'd through all
516,IV.,"Age sighs, and smiles, and trembles to recall."
517,IV.,From childhood fatherless and lone begun
518,IV.,"His fiery race, beneath as fierce a sun,"
519,IV.,"Where all extremes of Love and Horror are,"
520,IV.,"Soft Camdeo's lotos bark, grim Moloch's gory car;"
521,IV.,"Where basks the noonday luminously calm,"
522,IV.,O'er eldest grot and immemorial palm;
523,IV.,"And in the grot, the Goddess of the Dead"
524,IV.,"And the couch'd strangler, list the wanderer's tread,"
525,IV.,"And where the palm leaves stir with breeze-like sigh,"
526,IV.,Sports the fell serpent with his deathful eye.
527,IV.,
528,IV.,"Midst the exuberant life of that fierce zone,"
529,IV.,"Uncurb'd, self-will'd to man had Morvale grown."
530,IV.,His sire (the offspring of an Indian maid
531,IV.,"And English chief), whose orient hues betray'd"
532,IV.,The Varna Sankara[C] of the mix'd embrace.
533,IV.,Carved by his sword a charter from disgrace;
534,IV.,"Assumed the father's name, the Christian's life,"
535,IV.,And his sins cursed him with an English wife:
536,IV.,"A haughty dame, whose discontented charms"
537,IV.,"That merchant, Hymen, bargain'd to his arms."
538,IV.,"In war he fell: his wife--the bondage o'er,"
539,IV.,Loath'd the dark pledge the abhorrèd nuptials bore--
540,IV.,"Yet young, her face more genial wedlock won,"
541,IV.,And one bright daughter made more loath'd the son.
542,IV.,"Widow'd anew, for London's native air,"
543,IV.,"And two tall footmen, sigh'd the jointured fair:"
544,IV.,"Wealth hers, why longer from its use exiled?--"
545,IV.,She fled the land and the abandon'd child;
546,IV.,"Yet oft the first-born, 'midst the swarthier race,"
547,IV.,Gazed round and miss'd the fair unloving face.
548,IV.,"In vain the coldness, nay, the hate had been,"
549,IV.,"Hate, by the eyes that love, is rarely seen."
550,IV.,
551,IV.,"Yet more he miss'd the playmate, sister, child,"
552,IV.,With looks that ever on his own had smiled;
553,IV.,"With rosy lips, caressing and caress'd;"
554,IV.,Led by his hand and cradled on his breast:
555,IV.,"But, as the cloud conceals and breaks in flame,"
556,IV.,The gloom of youth the fire of man became.
557,IV.,"Not his the dreams that studious life allows,"
558,IV.,"""Under the shade of melancholy boughs,""--"
559,IV.,"Dreams that to lids the Muse anoints belong,--"
560,IV.,Rocking the passions on soft waves of song:
561,IV.,"No poet he; adventure, wandering, strife,"
562,IV.,"War and the chase, wrung poetry from life."
563,IV.,
564,IV.,"One day a man, who call'd his father ""friend,"""
565,IV.,Told o'er his rupees and perceived his end.
566,IV.,Life's business done--a million made--what still
567,IV.,Remain'd on earth? Wealth's last caprice--a Will!
568,IV.,The man was childless--but the world was wide;
569,IV.,"He thought on Morvale, made his will,--and died."
570,IV.,They sought and found the unsuspecting heir
571,IV.,Crouch'd in the shade that near'd the tiger's lair;
572,IV.,"His gun beside, the jungle round him--wild,"
573,IV.,Lawless and fierce as Hagar's wandering child:--
574,IV.,To this fresh nature the sleek life deceased
575,IV.,Left the bright plunder of the ravaged East.
576,IV.,
577,IV.,"Much wealth brings want,--that hunger of the heart"
578,IV.,Which comes when Nature man deserts for Art:
579,IV.,"His northern blood, his English name, create"
580,IV.,"Strife in the soul, till then resign'd to fate;"
581,IV.,"The social world with blander falsehood graced,"
582,IV.,"Smiles on his hopes, and lures him from the waste."
583,IV.,"Alas! the taint that sunburnt brow bespeaks,"
584,IV.,Divides the Half-Caste from the world he seeks:
585,IV.,"In him proud Europe sees the Paria's birth,"
586,IV.,And haughty Juno spurns his barren hearth.
587,IV.,"Half heathen, and half savage,--all estranged"
588,IV.,"Amidst his kind, the Ishmael roved unchanged."
589,IV.,
590,IV.,"Small need to track his course from year to year,"
591,IV.,Till wearied passion paused in its career:
592,IV.,Youth goads us on to action; lore of men
593,IV.,"Brings thought--thought books--books quiet; well, and then?"
594,IV.,Alas! we move but in the Hebrews' ring;[D]
595,IV.,"Our onward steps but back the landmarks bring,"
596,IV.,"Until some few at least escape the thrall,"
597,IV.,And breathe the space beyond the flaming wall:
598,IV.,"Feel the large freedom which in faith is given,"
599,IV.,And poise the wings that shall possess the heaven.
600,IV.,
601,IV.,"He sought his mother. She, intent to shun,"
602,IV.,"Closed that last refuge on the homeless son,"
603,IV.,"Till death approach'd, and Conscience, that sad star,"
604,IV.,"Which heralds night, and plays but on the bar"
605,IV.,"Of the Eternal Gate,--laid bare the crime,"
606,IV.,And woke the soul upon the brink of time.
607,IV.,"Haply if close, too closely, we would read"
608,IV.,"That sibyl page, the motive of the deed,"
609,IV.,"Remorse for him her life abandon'd, weaves"
610,IV.,Fear for the dearer one her death bereaves;
611,IV.,"And penitent lines consign'd, with eager prayer,"
612,IV.,The lorn Calantha to a brother's care.
613,IV.,"Not till long moons had waned in distant skies,"
614,IV.,O'er the last mandate wept the Indian's eyes;
615,IV.,"But the lost sister lived, the flower of yore"
616,IV.,"Bloom'd from the grave,--and earth was sweet once more;"
617,IV.,Fair Florence holds the heart he yearns to meet;
618,IV.,"Swift, when heart yearns to heart, how swift the feet!"
619,IV.,"Well, and those arms have clasp'd a sister now!"
620,IV.,Thy tears have fallen on a sister's brow!
621,IV.,Alas! a sister's heart thy doom forbade;
622,IV.,"Thy lot as lonely, and thy hearth as sad."
623,IV.,"Is that pale shade the Peri-child in truth,"
624,IV.,"Who shone, like Morning, on the hills of Youth?"
625,IV.,"Is that cold voice the same that rang through air,"
626,IV.,Blithe as the bird sings in rebuke of care?
627,IV.,
628,IV.,"Certes, to those who might more closely mark,"
629,IV.,That dove brought nought of gladness to his ark;
630,IV.,"No loving step, to meet him homeward, flew;"
631,IV.,Still at his voice her pale cheek paler grew.
632,IV.,"The greeting kiss, the tender trustful talk,--"
633,IV.,Arm link'd in arm--the dear familiar walk;
634,IV.,"The sweet domestic interchange of cares,"
635,IV.,Memories and hopes--this union was not theirs.
636,IV.,Partly perchance the jealous laws that guard
637,IV.,"The Eastern maids, their equal commune barr'd;"
638,IV.,"For still, in much the antique creed retain'd"
639,IV.,"Its hold, and India in the Alien reign'd:"
640,IV.,That superstitious love which would secure
641,IV.,"What the heart worships, for the world too pure;"
642,IV.,"And wrap with solemn mystery and divine,"
643,IV.,"From the crowd's gaze, the idol and the shrine,"
644,IV.,"In him was instinct,--generous if austere;"
645,IV.,"More priestly reverence, than dishonouring fear."
646,IV.,"Yet wherefore shun no less, if this were all,"
647,IV.,His lonely chamber than his crowded hall?
648,IV.,"For days, for weeks, perchance, unseen, aloof"
649,IV.,"Far as the poles, beneath one common roof,"
650,IV.,"She drew around her the cold spells, which part"
651,IV.,From forward sympathies the unsocial heart.
652,IV.,"Yet, strange to say, each seem'd to each still dear;"
653,IV.,And love in her but curb'd by stronger fear;
654,IV.,"And love in him by some mysterious pride,"
655,IV.,That sought the natural tenderness to hide:
656,IV.,"Did she but name him, you beheld her raise"
657,IV.,"Moist eyes to heaven, as one who inly prays."
658,IV.,"News of her varying health he daily sought,"
659,IV.,And his mood alter'd with the tidings brought:
660,IV.,"If worse than wonted, it was sad to view"
661,IV.,"That stern man's trembling lip and waning hue,--"
662,IV.,"Sad, yet the sadness with an awe was blent,--"
663,IV.,No words e'er gave the struggling passion vent;
664,IV.,"And still that passion seem'd not grief alone,"
665,IV.,Some curse seem'd labouring in the stifled groan:
666,IV.,Some angrier chord the mix'd emotion wrench'd;
667,IV.,"The brow was darken'd, and the hand was clench'd."
668,IV.,
669,IV.,"There was a mystery that defied the guess,"
670,IV.,"In so much love, and so much tenderness."
671,IV.,"What sword, invisible to human eyes,"
672,IV.,So sternly sever'd Nature's closest ties:
673,IV.,To leave each yearning unto each--apart--
674,IV.,"All ice the commune, and all warmth the heart?"
675,IV.,
676,IV.,
677,V.,V.
678,V.,
679,V.,"But how gain'd she, whom pity strange and rare"
680,V.,"Gave the night's refuge,--more than refuge there?"
681,V.,At morn the orphan hostess had received
682,V.,"The orphan outcast,--heard her and believed,--"
683,V.,"And Lucy wept her thanks, and turn'd to part;"
684,V.,But the sad tale had touch'd a woman's heart.
685,V.,"Calantha's youth was lone, her nature kind,"
686,V.,She knew no friend--she sigh'd a friend to find;
687,V.,"That chasten'd speech, the grace so simply worn,"
688,V.,Bespoke the nurture of the gentle-born;
689,V.,"And so she gazed upon the weeping guest,"
690,V.,"Check'd the intended alms, and murmur'd ""Rest,"
691,V.,"For both are orphans,--I should shelter thee,"
692,V.,"And, weep no more--thy smile shall comfort me."""
693,V.,
694,V.,Thus Lucy rested--finding day by day
695,V.,Her grateful heart the saving hand repay.
696,V.,Calantha loved her as the sad alone
697,V.,Love what consoles them;--in that life her own
698,V.,"Seem'd to revive, and even hope to flower:"
699,V.,"Ah, over Sorrow Youth has such sweet power!"
700,V.,"The very menials linger'd as they went,"
701,V.,"To spy the fairy to their dwelling sent,"
702,V.,"To list her light step on the stair, or hark"
703,V.,"Her song;--yes, _now_ the dove was in the ark!"
704,V.,"Ev'n the cold Morvale, spell'd at last, was found"
705,V.,Within the circle drawn his guest around;
706,V.,"Less rare his visits to Calantha grew,"
707,V.,And her eye shrunk less coldly from his view
708,V.,The presence of the gentle third one brought
709,V.,"Respite to memory, gave fresh play to thought;"
710,V.,"And as some child to strifeful parents sent,"
711,V.,"Laps the long discord in its own content,"
712,V.,"This happy creature seem'd to reach that home,"
713,V.,"To say--""Love enters where the guileless come!"""
714,V.,"It was not mirth, for mirth she was too still;"
715,V.,"It was not wit, wit leaves the heart more chill;"
716,V.,"But that continuous sweetness, which with ease"
717,V.,"Pleases all round it, from the wish to please,--"
718,V.,This was the charm that Lucy's smile bestow'd;
719,V.,The waves' fresh ripple from deep fountains flow'd;--
720,V.,"Below exhaustless gratitude,--above,"
721,V.,"Woman's meek temper, childhood's ready love."
722,V.,
723,V.,"Yet oft, when night reprieved the tender care,"
724,V.,And lonely thought stole musing on to prayer;
725,V.,"As some fair lake reflects, when day is o'er,"
726,V.,"With clearer wave from farther glades the shore,"
727,V.,"So, her still heart remember'd sorrows glass'd;"
728,V.,"And o'er its hush lay trembling all the past,"
729,V.,Again she sees a mother's gentle face;
730,V.,Again she feels a mother's soft embrace;
731,V.,"Again a mother's sigh of pain she hears,"
732,V.,"And starts--till lo, the spell dissolves in tears!"
733,V.,"Tears that too well the faithful grief reveal,"
734,V.,"Which smiles, by day made duties, would conceal."
735,V.,
736,V.,
737,VI.,VI.
738,VI.,
739,VI.,"It was a noon of summer in its glow,"
740,VI.,"And all was life, but London's life, below;"
741,VI.,As by the open casement half reclined
742,VI.,Calantha's languid form;--a gentle wind
743,VI.,"Brought to her cheek a bloom unwonted there,"
744,VI.,And stirr'd the light wave of the golden hair.
745,VI.,"Hers was a beauty that made sad the eye,"
746,VI.,"Lovely in fading, like a twilight sky;"
747,VI.,"The shape so finely, delicately frail,"
748,VI.,As form'd for climes unruffled by a gale;
749,VI.,"The lustrous eye, through which looks forth the soul,"
750,VI.,Bright and more brightly as it nears the goal;
751,VI.,"The fever'd counterfeit of healthful bloom,"
752,VI.,The rose so living yet so near the tomb;
753,VI.,"The veil the Funeral Genius lends his bride,"
754,VI.,"When, fair as Love, he steals her to his side,"
755,VI.,"And leads her on till at the nuptial porch,"
756,VI.,"He murmurs, ""Know me now!"" and lowers the torch."
757,VI.,"What made more sad the outward form's decay,"
758,VI.,A soul of genius glimmer'd through the clay;
759,VI.,Oft through the languor of disease would break
760,VI.,That life of light Parnassian dreamers seek;
761,VI.,And music trembled on each aspen leaf
762,VI.,Of the boughs drooping o'er the fount of grief.
763,VI.,
764,VI.,Genius has so much youth no care can kill;
765,VI.,"Death seems unnatural when it sighs--""Be still."""
766,VI.,"That wealth, which Nature prodigally gave,"
767,VI.,Shall Life but garner for its heir the Grave?
768,VI.,What noble hearts that treasure might have bless'd!
769,VI.,How large the realm that mind should have possess'd!
770,VI.,"Love in the wife, and wisdom in the friend,"
771,VI.,"And earnest purpose for a generous end,"
772,VI.,And glowing sympathy for thoughts of power
773,VI.,And playful fancy for the lighter hour;
774,VI.,"All lost, all cavern'd in the sunless gloom"
775,VI.,"Of some dark memory, beetling o'er the tomb;--"
776,VI.,"Like bright-wing'd fairies, whom the hostile gnome"
777,VI.,"Has spell'd and dungeon'd in his rocky home,"
778,VI.,"The wanderer hears the solitary moan,"
779,VI.,Nor dreams the fairy in the sullen stone.
780,VI.,
781,VI.,"Contrasting this worn frame and weary breast,"
782,VI.,Fresh as a morn of April bloom'd the guest:
783,VI.,"April has tears, and mists the morn array;"
784,VI.,"The mists foretell the sun,--the tears the May."
785,VI.,"Lo, as from care to care the soother glides,"
786,VI.,How the home brightens where the heart presides!
787,VI.,"Now hovering, bird-like, o'er the flowers,--at times"
788,VI.,"Pausing to chant Calantha's favourite rhymes,"
789,VI.,Or smooth the uneasy pillow with light hand;
790,VI.,"Or watch the eye, forestalling the demand,"
791,VI.,Complete in every heavenly art--above
792,VI.,"All, save the genius of inventive love."
793,VI.,
794,VI.,"The window open'd on that breadth of green,"
795,VI.,To half the pomp of elder days the scene.
796,VI.,Gaze to thy left--there the Plantagenet
797,VI.,Look'd on the lists for Norman knighthood set;[E]
798,VI.,"Bright issued forth, where yonder archway glooms,"
799,VI.,"Banner and trump, and steed, and waves of plumes,"
800,VI.,As with light heart rides wanton Anne to brave
801,VI.,"Tudor's grim love, the purple and the grave."
802,VI.,"Gaze to the right, where now--neat, white, and low,"
803,VI.,The modest Palace looks like Brunswick Row;[F]
804,VI.,"There, echoed once the merriest orgies known,"
805,VI.,Since the frank Norman won grave Harold's throne;
806,VI.,"There, bloom'd the mulberry groves, beneath whose shade"
807,VI.,His easy loves the royal Rowley made;
808,VI.,"Where Villiers flaunted, and where Sedley sung,"
809,VI.,And wit's loose diamonds dropp'd from Wilmot's tongue!
810,VI.,All at rest now--all dust!--wave flows on wave;
811,VI.,But the sea dries not!--what to us the grave?
812,VI.,"It brings no real homily, we sigh,"
813,VI.,"Pause for awhile and murmur, ""All must die!"""
814,VI.,"Then rush to pleasure, action, sin once more,"
815,VI.,"Swell the loud tide, and fret unto the shore."
816,VI.,
817,VI.,And o'er the altered scene Calantha's eye
818,VI.,Roves listless--yet Time's Great the passers by!
819,VI.,Along the road still fleet the men whose names
820,VI.,Live in the talk the moment's glory claims.
821,VI.,"There, for the hot Pancratia of Debate"
822,VI.,"Pass the keen wrestlers for that palm,--the State."
823,VI.,"Now, ""on his humble but his faithful steed,"""
824,VI.,Sir Robert rides--he never rides at speed--
825,VI.,"Careful his seat, and circumspect his gaze;"
826,VI.,And still the cautious trot the cautious mind betrays.
827,VI.,"Wise is thy heed!--how stout soe'er his back,"
828,VI.,Thy weight has oft proved fatal to thy hack![G]
829,VI.,"Next, with loose rein and careless canter view"
830,VI.,"Our man of men, the Prince of Waterloo;"
831,VI.,"O'er the firm brow the hat as firmly press'd,"
832,VI.,The firm shape rigid in the button'd vest;
833,VI.,"Within--the iron which the fire has proved,"
834,VI.,And the close Sparta of a mind unmoved!
835,VI.,
836,VI.,"Not his the wealth to some large natures lent,"
837,VI.,"Divinely lavish, even where misspent,"
838,VI.,"That liberal sunshine of exuberant soul,"
839,VI.,"Thought, sense, affection, warming up the whole;"
840,VI.,"The heat and affluence of a genial power,"
841,VI.,Rank in the weed as vivid in the flower;
842,VI.,"Hush'd at command his veriest passions halt,"
843,VI.,"Drill'd is each virtue, disciplined each fault;"
844,VI.,"Warm if his blood--he reasons while he glows,"
845,VI.,Admits the pleasure--ne'er the folly knows;
846,VI.,"If Vulcan for our Mars a snare had set,"
847,VI.,"He had won the Venus, but escaped the net;"
848,VI.,"His eye ne'er wrong, if circumscribed the sight,"
849,VI.,"Widen the prospect and it ne'er is right,"
850,VI.,"Seen through the telescope of habit still,"
851,VI.,"States seem a camp, and all the world--a drill!"
852,VI.,
853,VI.,"Yet oh, how few his faults, how pure his mind,"
854,VI.,Beside his fellow-conquerors of mankind;
855,VI.,"How knightly seems the iron image, shown"
856,VI.,"By Marlborough's tomb, or lost Napoleon's throne!"
857,VI.,"Cold if his lips, no smile of fraud they wear,"
858,VI.,"Stern if his heart, still ""Man"" is graven there;"
859,VI.,"No guile--no crime his step to greatness made,"
860,VI.,"No freedom trampled, and no trust betray'd;"
861,VI.,"The eternal ""I"" was not his law--he rose"
862,VI.,"Without one art that honour might oppose,"
863,VI.,"And leaves a human, if a hero's, name,"
864,VI.,To curb ambition while it lights to fame.
865,VI.,
866,VI.,"But who, scarce less by every gazer eyed,"
867,VI.,"Walks yonder, swinging with a stalwart stride?"
868,VI.,With that vast bulk of chest and limb assign'd
869,VI.,So oft to men who subjugate their kind;
870,VI.,So sturdy Cromwell push'd broad-shoulder'd on;
871,VI.,So burly Luther breasted Babylon;
872,VI.,So brawny Cleon bawl'd his Agora down;
873,VI.,And large-limb'd Mahmoud clutch'd a Prophet's crown!
874,VI.,
875,VI.,"Ay, mark him well! the schemer's subtle eye,"
876,VI.,The stage-mime's plastic lip your search defy--
877,VI.,"He, like Lysander, never deems it sin"
878,VI.,To eke the lion's with the fox's skin;
879,VI.,"Vain every mesh this Proteus to enthrall,"
880,VI.,"He breaks no statute, and he creeps through all;--"
881,VI.,"First to the mass that valiant truth to tell,"
882,VI.,"""Rebellion's art is never to rebel,--"
883,VI.,"Elude all danger but defy all laws,""--"
884,VI.,He stands himself the Safe Sublime he draws!
885,VI.,In him behold all contrasts which belong
886,VI.,"To minds abased, but passions roused, by wrong;"
887,VI.,"The blood all fervour, and the brain all guile,"
888,VI.,"The patriot's bluntness, and the bondsman's wile."
889,VI.,"One after one the lords of time advance,--"
890,VI.,"Here Stanley meets,--how Stanley scorns, the glance!"
891,VI.,"The brilliant chief, irregularly great,"
892,VI.,"Frank, haughty, rash,--the Rupert of Debate;"

1301,II.,"And mien--a mantle and a majesty,"
1302,II.,At once concealing all the strife below
1303,II.,"It shames the pride of lofty hearts to show,"
1304,II.,And robing Art's lone outlaw with the air
1305,II.,Of nameless state the lords of Nature wear;--

1369,II.,"I tell of guilt--and guilt all men must own,"
1370,II.,Who but avow the loves their youth has known.
1371,II.,"Preach as we will, in this wrong world of ours,"

1676,VI.,Each thought divides the absent from my lot.
1677,VI.,"One night, escaped my kinsman's hall, which blazed"
1678,VI.,"With dames who smiled, and garter'd peers who praised,"
1679,VI.,"I seek my lonely home,--ascend the stair,--"
1680,VI.,"Gain my dim room,--what stranger daunts me there?"

1683,VI.,The bride's sad father on the bridegroom's floor!         }
1684,VI.,"In the brief pause, how terrible and fast,"
1685,VI.,"As on the drowning seaman, rush'd the past!"
1686,VI.,"How had he learn'd my name,--abode,--the tie"
1687,VI.,That bound?--for all spoke lightning in his eye.
1688,VI.,"Lo, on the secret in whose darkness lay"
1689,VI.,"Power, future, fortune, pour'd the hateful ray!"

1702,VI.,'My child--God pardon me!--I was too proud
1703,VI.,"To call her ""daughter!""--what shall call the crowd?"
1704,VI.,"Man--man, she cowers beneath a Father's eye,"
1705,VI.,And shuns his blessing--with one wish to die;
1706,VI.,And I that death-bed will resign'd endure
1707,VI.,If--speak the word--the soul that parts is pure?'

1723,VI.,"And shrunk to self-rebuke the threatening word,"
1724,VI.,"'Man's not my weapons--I thy servant, Lord!'"
1725,VI.,"Moved, I replied--'Could love suffice alone               }"
1726,VI.,"In this hard world,--the love to thee made known,         }"
1727,VI.,"A bliss to cherish, 'twere a pride to own:                }"
1728,VI.,"And if I pause, and if I falter--yet"
1729,VI.,"I hide no shame, I strive with no regret."

1742,VI.,"Whose but _her_ lips, sworn never to betray,"
1743,VI.,"Had fail'd their oath, and dragg'd my name to day?"
1744,VI.,"True, she had left the veil upon the shrine,"
1745,VI.,But set the snare to make confession mine.
1746,VI.,"Thus half resentment, half disdain, repell'd"
1747,VI.,"The man's frank justice, and the truth withheld."
1748,VI.,"Yet, so invoked, I scorn'd at least the lie,"
1749,VI.,And met the question with this proud reply:--
1750,VI.,"'If thou dost doubt thy child, depart secure,"
1751,VI.,"My love is sinless, and her soul is pure."
1752,VI.,"This by mine honour, and to Heaven, I swear!"
1753,VI.,Dost thou ask more?--then bid thy child declare;
1754,VI.,"What she proclaims as truth, myself will own;"
1755,VI.,"What she withholds, alike I leave unknown;"
1756,VI.,"What she demands, I am prepared to yield;"
1757,VI.,Now doubt or spurn me--but my lips are seal'd.'
1758,VI.,"I ceased, and stood with haughty mien and eye,"
1759,VI.,That seem'd all further question to defy;
1760,VI.,"He gazed, as if still spell'd in hope or fear,"
1761,VI.,And hungering for the word that fail'd the ear.
1762,VI.,"At last, and half unconscious, in the thrall"
1763,VI.,"Of the cold awe, he groan'd--"
1764,VI.,
1765,VI.,'And is this all?
1766,VI.,"Courage, poor child--there may be justice yet--"
1767,VI.,"Justice, Heaven, justice!'"
1768,VI.,
1769,VI.,With this doubtful threat
1770,VI.,"He turn'd, was gone!--that look of stern despair,"
1771,VI.,"The uncertain footstep tottering down the stair,"
1772,VI.,"The clapping door; and then that void and chill,"
1773,VI.,"Which would be silence, were the conscience still;"
1774,VI.,"That sense of something gone, we would recall;"
1775,VI.,The soul's dim stun before it feels its fall.

2845,III.,"One felt, unseen, infection circling there"
2846,III.,"A bodiless venom in the common air,"
2847,III.,And as the air impalpable!--so seem
2848,III.,"The undistinguished terrors of a dream,"

3606,I.,"O'er the same bridge which once to rapture led,"
3607,I.,Went the same steps their pathway to the dead:
3608,I.,Night after night the same lone shadow gave
3609,I.,A tremulous darkness to the hurrying wave;
3610,I.,"Lost,--and then, lengthening from the neighbouring yews,"
3611,I.,"Dimm'd the wan shimmer of the moonlit dews,"
3612,I.,"Then gain'd a grave;--and from the mound was thrown,"
3613,I.,Still as the shadow of yon funeral stone!
3614,I.,
3615,I.,
3616,II.,II.
3617,II.,
3618,II.,"Meanwhile to Morvale!--Sorrow, like the wind"
3619,II.,"Through trees, stirs varying o'er each human mind;"
3620,II.,"Uprooting some, from some it doth but strew"
3621,II.,"Blossom and leaf, which spring restores anew;"
3622,II.,"From some, but shakes rich powers unknown in calm,"
3623,II.,And wakes the trouble to extract the balm.
3624,II.,"Let weaker natures suffer and despair,"
3625,II.,Great souls snatch vigour from the stormy air;
3626,II.,"Grief not the languor,--Grief the action brings;"
3627,II.,And clouds the horizon but to nerve the wings.
3628,II.,
3629,II.,"Up from his heavy thought, one dawning day,"
3630,II.,"The Indian, silent, rose, and went his way;"
3631,II.,"Palace and pomp and wealth and ease resign'd,             }"
3632,II.,"As one new-born, he plunged amidst his kind,              }"
3633,II.,"Whither, with what intent, he scarce divined.             }"
3634,II.,"He turn'd to see, through mists obscure and dun,"
3635,II.,The domes and spires of the vex'd Babylon;
3636,II.,"Before him smiled the mead and waved the corn,"
3637,II.,And Nature's music swell'd the hymns of Morn.
3638,II.,"A sense of freedom, of the large escape"
3639,II.,From the pent walls our customs round us shape;
3640,II.,"The imperfect sympathies which curse the few,"
3641,II.,Who ne'er the chase the many join pursue;
3642,II.,"The trite convention, with its cold control,"
3643,II.,"Which thralls the habit, yet not links the soul;"
3644,II.,"--The sense of freedom pass'd into his breast,"
3645,II.,But found no hope it flatter'd and caress'd;
3646,II.,"So the sad captive, when at length made free,"
3647,II.,Shrinks from the sunlight he had pined to see;
3648,II.,"Feels on the limb the custom of the chain,"
3649,II.,"Each step a struggle and each breath a pain,"
3650,II.,"And knows--return'd unto the world too late,"
3651,II.,No smile shall greet him at his lonely gate;
3652,II.,"Seal'd every eye, of old that watch'd and wept;"
3653,II.,The world he knew has vanish'd while he slept!
3654,II.,
3655,II.,"He wander'd on, alone, on foot,--alone,"
3656,II.,As in the waste his earlier steps had known.
3657,II.,Forth went the peasant--Adam's curse begun;--
3658,II.,Home went the peasant in the western sun;
3659,II.,"He heard the bleating fold, the lowing herd,"
3660,II.,The last shrill carol of the nestling bird!
3661,II.,He saw the rare lights of the hamlet gleam
3662,II.,And fade;--the stars grow stiller on the stream;
3663,II.,"Swart, by the woodland, cower'd the gipsy tent"
3664,II.,Whence peer'd dark eyes that watch'd him as he went--
3665,II.,He paused and turn'd:--Him more the outlaws charm
3666,II.,Than the trim hostel and the happy farm.
3667,II.,"Strangers, like him, from antique lands afar,"
3668,II.,"Aliens untamed where'er their wanderings are,"
3669,II.,High Syrian sires of old;[V]--dark fragments torn
3670,II.,"From the great creed of Isis,--now forlorn"
3671,II.,"In rags--all earth their foe, and day by day"
3672,II.,Worn in the strife with social Jove away--
3673,II.,"Wretched, 'tis true, yet less enslaved, their strife,"
3674,II.,"Than our false peace with all this masque of life,"
3675,II.,"Convention's lies,--the league with Custom made,"
3676,II.,"The crimes of glory, and the frauds of trade."
3677,II.,Rest and rude food the lawless Nomads yield;
3678,II.,"The dews rise ghost-like from the whitening field,"
3679,II.,And ghost-like on the wanderer glides the sleep
3680,II.,Through which the phantom Dreams their witching Sabbat keep!
3681,II.,
3682,II.,"At dawn, while yet, around the Indian, lay"
3683,II.,"The dark, fantastic groups,--resumed the way;"
3684,II.,Before his steps the landscape spreads more free
3685,II.,"And fresh from man;--ev'n as a broadening sea,"
3686,II.,"When, more and more the harbour left behind,"
3687,II.,The lone sail drifts before the strengthening wind.
3688,II.,"Behold the sun!--how stately from the East,"
3689,II.,"Bright from God's presence, comes the glorious Priest!"
3690,II.,Deck'd as beseems the Mighty One to whom
3691,II.,Heaven gives the charge to hallow and illume!
3692,II.,"How, as he comes,--through the Great Temple, EARTH,"
3693,II.,Peels the rich Jubilee of grateful mirth!
3694,II.,"The infant flowers their odour-censers swinging,"
3695,II.,Through aislëd glades Air's Anthem-Chorus ringing;
3696,II.,"While, like some soul lifted aloft by love,"
3697,II.,"High and alone the sky-lark halts above,"
3698,II.,"High, o'er the sparkling dews, the glittering corn,"
3699,II.,Hymns his frank happiness and hails the morn!
3700,II.,
3701,II.,"He stands upon the green hill's lighted brow,"
3702,II.,"And sees the world at smiling peace below,"
3703,II.,"Hamlet and farm, and thy best type, Desire"
3704,II.,"Of the sad Heart,--the heaven-ascending spire!"
3705,II.,
3706,II.,"He stood and mused, and thus his musing ran:--"
3707,II.,"""How strong, how feeble, is thine art, O Man!"
3708,II.,Thou coverest Earth with wonders--at thy hand
3709,II.,"Curbs the meek water, blooms the subject land:"
3710,II.,Why halts thy magic here?--Why only deck'd
3711,II.,"Earth's sterile surface, mournful Architect?"
3712,II.,Why art thou powerless o'er the world within?
3713,II.,"Why raise the Eden, yet retain the sin?"
3714,II.,"Why, while the earth, thou but enjoy'st an hour,"
3715,II.,"Proclaims thy splendour and attests thy power,"
3716,II.,Why o'er the spirit does thy sorcery cease?--
3717,II.,Lo the sweet landscape round thee lull'd in peace!
3718,II.,"Why wakes each heart to sorrow, care, and strife?"
3719,II.,Why with yon temple so at war the life?
3720,II.,"Why all so slight the variance, or in grief"
3721,II.,"Or guilt,--the sum of suffering and relief,"
3722,II.,Between the desert's son whose wild content
3723,II.,"Redeems no waste, enthralls no element,"
3724,II.,And ye the Magians?--ye the giant birth
3725,II.,Of Lore and Science--Brahmins of the Earth?
3726,II.,"Behold the calm steer drinking in the stream,"
3727,II.,Behold the glad bird glancing in the beam.
3728,II.,"Say, know ye pleasure,--ye, the Eternal Heirs"
3729,II.,"Of stars and spheres--life's calm content, like theirs?"
3730,II.,"Your stores enrich, your powers exalt, the few,"
3731,II.,And curse the millions wealth and power subdue;
3732,II.,And ev'n the few!--what lord of luxury knows
3733,II.,"The joy in strife, the sweetness in repose,"
3734,II.,Which bless the houseless Arab?--Still behind             }
3735,II.,"Ease waits Disgust, and with the falling wind             }"
3736,II.,Droop the dull sails ordain'd to speed the mind.          }
3737,II.,"Increasing wants the sum of care increase,"
3738,II.,"The piled-up knowledge but sepulchres peace,"
3739,II.,"Ye quell the instincts, the free love, frank hate,"
3740,II.,And bid hard Reason hold the scales of Fate--
3741,II.,What is your gain?--from each slain instinct springs
3742,II.,"A hydra passion, poisoning while it stings;"
3743,II.,"Free love, foul lust;--the frank hate's manly strife"
3744,II.,A plotting mask'd dissimulating life;--
3745,II.,Truth flies the world--one falsehood taints the sky
3746,II.,"Each form a phantom, and each word a lie!"
3747,II.,
3748,II.,"""Yet what am I?--the crush'd and baffled foe,"
3749,II.,"Who dared the strife, yet would denounce the blow."
3750,II.,What arms had I against this world to wield?
3751,II.,What mail the naked savage heart to shield?
3752,II.,"To this hoar world I brought the trusts of youth,"
3753,II.,"Warm zeal for men, and fix'd repose in truth--"
3754,II.,"Amongst the young I look'd for young desires,"
3755,II.,"Love which adores, and Honour which aspires--"

3757,II.,"The earthlier chains which young desires enthrall,"
3758,II.,"Serene and gentle both to soothe and chide,"
3759,II.,"The sires to pity, yet the seers to guide--"
3760,II.,"And lo! this civilised and boasted plan,"
3761,II.,"This order'd ring and harmony of man,"
3762,II.,"One hideous, cynic, levelling orgy, where"
3763,II.,"Youth Age's ice, and Age Youth's fever share--"
3764,II.,"The unwrinkled brow, the calculating brain,"
3765,II.,"The passion balanced with the weights of gain,"
3766,II.,And Age more hotly clutching than the boy
3767,II.,At the lewd bauble and the gilded toy.

3805,II.,"At night his pause was at the lowliest door,"
3806,II.,The beggar'd heart makes brothers of the Poor;

3810,II.,Each knave a brother--Parasites of all--

3814,II.,In this ill world with generous scorn despise;
3815,II.,"Yet of the wrong he hates, the grief he shares,"
3816,II.,"His lip rebuke, his soul compassion, wears;"
3817,II.,The Hermit's wrath bespeaks the Preacher's hope
3818,II.,Who loves men most--men call the Misanthrope!
3819,II.,
3820,II.,At times with honest toil reposed--at times
3821,II.,"Where gnawing wants beset despairing crimes,"
3822,II.,"Both still betray'd the sojourn of his soul,"
3823,II.,"Here wise to cheer, there fearless to control."
3824,II.,His that strange power the Church's Fathers had
3825,II.,To awe the fierce and to console the sad;

3843,II.,"Revenge, denied indeed, still rankled deep"
3844,II.,"In thought--and dimm'd the day, and marr'd the sleep"

3856,II.,Nor when his instinct of the life afar
3857,II.,"Soar'd from the soil and task'd the unanswering star,"

3859,II.,That fitful moonlight on the unknown path;
3860,II.,"And not the glory of the joyous sun,"
3861,II.,That fills with light whate'er it shines upon;

3879,II.,What though our path at every step is strewn
3880,II.,With leaves that shadow'd in the summer noon;
3881,II.,"Through the clear space more vigorous comes the air,"
3882,II.,And the star pierces where the branch is bare.

3995,II.,Proclaiming God where'er Creation lives;
3996,II.,But _there_ the doubt will come!--the clear design
3997,II.,Attests the Maker and suggests the Shrine;
3998,II.,"But in that visible harmonious plan,"
3999,II.,What present shows the _future_ world to man?
4000,II.,"What lore detects, beneath our crumbling clay,"
4001,II.,"A soul exiled, and journeying back to day;"
4002,II.,"What knowledge, in the bones of charnel urns,"
4003,II.,"The etherial spark, the undying thought, discerns?"
4004,II.,"How from the universal war, the prey"
4005,II.,"Of life on life, can love explore the way?"
4006,II.,"Search the material tribes of earth, sea, air,"
4007,II.,And the fierce SELF that strives and slays is there.
4008,II.,What but that SELF to Man doth Nature teach?
4009,II.,Where the charm'd link that binds the all to each?
4010,II.,Where the sweet Law--(doth Nature boast its birth)--
4011,II.,"""Good will to man, and charity to earth?"""
4012,II.,"Not in the world without, but that within,"
4013,II.,"Reveal'd, not instinct--soul from sense can win!"
4014,II.,"And where the Natural halts, where cramp'd, confined,"
4015,II.,"The seen horizon bounds the baffled mind,"
4016,II.,The Inspired begins--the onward march is given;
4017,II.,"Bridging all space, nor ending ev'n in Heaven!"
4018,II.,"There, veil'd on earth, we mark divinely clear,"
4019,II.,Duty and end--the There explains the Here!
4020,II.,"We see the link that binds the future band,"
4021,II.,Foeman with foeman gliding hand in hand;
4022,II.,And feel that Hate is but an hour's--the son
4023,II.,"Of earth, to perish when the earth is done--"
4024,II.,"But Love eternal; and we turn below,"
4025,II.,To hail the brother where we loathed the foe;
4026,II.,"There, in the soft and beautiful Belief,"
4027,II.,Flows the true Lethé for the lips of Grief;
4028,II.,"There, Penury, Hunger, Misery, cast their eyes,"
4029,II.,How soon the bright Republic of the Skies!
4030,II.,"There, Love, heart-broken, sees prepared the bower,"
4031,II.,"And hears the bridal step, and waits the nuptial hour!"
4032,II.,"There, smiles the mother we have wept! there bloom"
4033,II.,Again the buds asleep within the tomb;
4034,II.,"There, souls regain what hearts had lost before"
4035,II.,In that fix'd moment call'd the--Evermore!
4036,II.,
4037,II.,"Refresh'd in that soft baptism, and reborn,"
4038,II.,"The Indian woke, and on the world was morn!"
4039,II.,All things seem'd new--rose-colour'd in the skies
4040,II.,Shone the hoar peaks of the old memories;
4041,II.,No more enshrouded with unbroken gloom
4042,II.,Calantha's injured name and early tomb--
4043,II.,No more with woe (how ill-suppress'd by pride!)
4044,II.,Thought sounds the gulf that parts the promised bride!
4045,II.,"Faithful no less to Death, and true to Love,"
4046,II.,"This blooms again--that shall rejoin, above!"
4047,II.,The Stoic courage had the wound conceal'd;
4048,II.,The Christian hope the wound's sharp torture heal'd.
4049,II.,"As rude the waste, but now before him shone               }"
4050,II.,"The star;--he rose, and cheerful journey'd on,            }"

4056,III.,"'Tis night,--a night by fits now foul, now fair,"
4057,III.,As speed the cloud-wracks through the gusty air:
4058,III.,"At times the wild blast dies--and high and far,"
4059,III.,"Through chasms of cloud, looks down the solemn star--"
4060,III.,Or the majestic moon;--so watchfires mark
4061,III.,Some sleeping War dim-tented in the dark;
4062,III.,"Or so, through antique Chaos and the storm"
4063,III.,"Of Matter, whirl'd and writhing into form,"
4064,III.,Pale angels peer'd!
4065,III.,
4066,III.,"Anon, from brief repose"
4067,III.,"The winds leap forth, the cloven deeps reclose;"
4068,III.,"Mass upon mass, the hurtling vapours driven,"
4069,III.,As one huge blackness walls the earth from heaven!--
4070,III.,"In one of these brief lulls--you see, serene,"
4071,III.,"The village church spire 'mid its mounds of green,"
4072,III.,"The scattered roof-tops of the hamlet round,"
4073,III.,And the swoll'n rill that girds the holy ground.
4074,III.,
4075,III.,"A plank that rock'd above the rushing wave,"
4076,III.,The dizzy pathway to a wanderer gave;
4077,III.,"There, as he paused, from the lone churchyard, slow"
4078,III.,Emerged a form the wanderer's eyes should know!
4079,III.,"It gains the opposing margent of the stream,"
4080,III.,Full on the face shines calm the crescent beam;
4081,III.,"It halts upon the bridge! Now, Indian, learn"
4082,III.,If in thy soul the heathen yet can yearn!
4083,III.,"Swift runs the wave, the instinct and the hour,"
4084,III.,"The lonely night, when evil thoughts have power,"
4085,III.,"The foe before thee, and no things that live"
4086,III.,To witness vengeance--Canst thou still forgive?
4087,III.,"Scarce seen by each the face of each--when, deep"
4088,III.,"O'er the lost moon, the cloud's loud surges sweep;"
4089,III.,"Yea, as a sea devours the fated bark,"
4090,III.,"Vanish'd the heaven, and closed the abyss of dark!"
4091,III.,"You heard the roaring of the mighty blast,"
4092,III.,The groaning trees uprooted as it pass'd
4093,III.,"The wrath and madness of the starless rill,"
4094,III.,Swell'd by each torrent rushing from the hill.
4095,III.,"The slight plank creaks--high mount the waves and high,"
4096,III.,Hark! with the tempest's shrieks the human cry!
4097,III.,"Upon the bridge but _one_ man now!--below,"
4098,III.,The night of waters and the drowning foe!
4099,III.,The Indian heard the death-cry and the fall;
4100,III.,Still o'er the wild scene hung the funeral pall!
4101,III.,What eye can pierce the darkness of the wave?             }
4102,III.,What hand guide rescue through the roaring grave?         }
4103,III.,Not for such craven questions pause the brave!            }
4104,III.,"Again the moon!--again the churchyard's green,"
4105,III.,"Spire, hamlet, mead, and rill distinct are seen;"
4106,III.,"But on the bridge _no_ form, no life! The beam"
4107,III.,Shoots wan and broken on the tortured stream;
4108,III.,"Vague, indistinct, what yonder moveth o'er"
4109,III.,"The troubled tide, and struggles to the shore?"
4110,III.,"Hark, where the sere bough of the tossing tree"
4111,III.,"Snaps in the grasp of some strong agony,"
4112,III.,"And the dull plunge, and stifled cry betray"
4113,III.,Where the grim water-fiend reclasps his prey!
4114,III.,
4115,III.,"Still shines the moon--still halts the panting storm,"
4116,III.,"It moves again--the shadow shapes to form,"
4117,III.,"Lo! where yon bank shelves gradual, and the ray"
4118,III.,"Silvers the reed, it cleaves its vigorous way!--"
4119,III.,"Saved from the deep, but happier far to save,"
4120,III.,The foeman wrests the foeman from the grave!
4121,III.,Still shines the moon--still halts the storm!--above
4122,III.,"His sons, looks down divine the Father-Love!"
4123,III.,"Upon the Indian's breast droops Arden's head,"
4124,III.,Its marble beauty rigid as the dead.
4125,III.,"What skill so fondly tends the soul's eclipse,"
4126,III.,"Chafes the stiff limb, and breathes in breathless lips?"
4127,III.,"Wooes back the flickering life, and when, once more,"
4128,III.,The ebbing blood the wan cheek mantles o'er;
4129,III.,"When stirs the pulse, when opes the glazing eye,"
4130,III.,What voice of joy finds listeners in the sky?
4131,III.,"""Bless thee, my God!--this mercy thine!--he lives:"
4132,III.,"Look in my heart, forgive, for it forgives!"""
4133,III.,
4134,III.,"Then, while yet clear the heaven, he flies--he gains"
4135,III.,The nearest roof--prompt aid his prayer obtains;
4136,III.,Well known the noble stranger's mien--they bear
4137,III.,"To the rude home, and ply the zealous care;"
4138,III.,"Life with the dawn comes sure, if faint and slow,"
4139,III.,And all night long the foeman watch'd the foe!
4140,III.,
4141,III.,"Day dawns on earth, still darkness wraps the mind;"
4142,III.,"Sleep pass'd, the waking is a veil more blind:"
4143,III.,"The soul, scared roughly from its mansion, glides"
4144,III.,O'er mazy wastes through which the meteor guides.
4145,III.,
4146,III.,"The startled menial, who, alone of all"
4147,III.,"The hireling pomp that swarms in Arden's hall,"
4148,III.,"Attends his lord,--dismay'd lest one so high,"
4149,III.,"A rural Galen should permit to die,"
4150,III.,Departs in haste to seek the subtler skill
4151,III.,Which from the College takes the right to kill;
4152,III.,And summon Lucy to the solemn room
4153,III.,"To watch the father's life,--fast by the mother's tomb."
4154,III.,"Meanwhile such facile arts as nature yields,"
4155,III.,"Draughts from the spring and simples from the fields,"
4156,III.,"Learn'd in his savage youth, the Indian plies;"
4157,III.,"The fever slakes, the cloudy darkness flies;"
4158,III.,"O'er the vex'd vision steals the lulling rest,"
4159,III.,And Arden wakes to sense on Morvale's breast!
4160,III.,
4161,III.,On Morvale's breast!--and through the noiseless door
4162,III.,"A fearful footfall creeps, and lo! once more"
4163,III.,"Thou look'st, pale daughter, on thy father's foe!"
4164,III.,Not with the lurid eye and menaced blow;
4165,III.,"Not as when last, between the murtherous blade"
4166,III.,"And the proud victim, gleam'd the guardian maid--"
4167,III.,Thy post is his!--that breast the prop supplies
4168,III.,"That thine should yield;--as thine so watch those eyes,"
4169,III.,"Wistful and moist, that waning life above;"
4170,III.,Recal the Heathen's hate!--behold the Christian's love!
4171,III.,
4172,III.,The learned leech proclaims the danger o'er;
4173,III.,"When life is safe, can Fate then harm no more?"
4174,III.,
4175,III.,"The danger past for Arden, but for you"
4176,III.,"Who watch the couch, what danger threats anew?"
4177,III.,"How meet in pious duty and fond care,"
4178,III.,In hours when through the eye the heart is bare?
4179,III.,"How join in those soft sympathies, and yet"
4180,III.,"The earlier link, the tenderer bond forget?"
4181,III.,"How can the soul the magnet-charm withstand,"
4182,III.,"When chance brings look to look, and hand to hand!"
4183,III.,"No, Indian, no--if yet the power divine"
4184,III.,Above the laws of our low world be thine;
4185,III.,If yet the Honour which thy later creed
4186,III.,"Softens, not quells, revere the injured dead,"
4187,III.,"Fly, ere the full heart cries, ""I love thee still""--"
4188,III.,And find thy guardian in the angel--WILL!
4189,III.,That power was his!
4190,III.,
4191,III.,Along the landscape lay
4192,III.,The hazy rime of winter's dawning day:
4193,III.,"Snake-like the curving mists betray'd the rill,"
4194,III.,"The last star gleam'd upon the Eastern hill,"
4195,III.,Still slept beneath the leafless trees the herd;
4196,III.,Still mute the sharp note of the sunless bird;
4197,III.,"No sound, no life; as to some hearth, bereft"
4198,III.,"By death, of welcome, since his wanderings left,"
4199,III.,"Comes back the traveller;--so to earth, forlorn"
4200,III.,Returns the ungreeted melancholy Morn.
4201,III.,
4202,III.,Forth from the threshold stole the Indian!--far
4203,III.,Spread the dim land beneath the waning star.
4204,III.,Alas! how wide the world his heart will find
4205,III.,"Who leaves one spot--the heart's true home, behind!"
4206,III.,He paused--one upward look upon the gloom
4207,III.,"Of the closed casement, the love-hallow'd room,"
4208,III.,"Where yet, perchance, while happier Suffering slept"
4209,III.,Its mournful vigil tender Duty kept;
4210,III.,One prayer! What mercy taught us prayer?--as dews
4211,III.,"On drooping herbs--as sleep tired life renews,"
4212,III.,"As dreams that lead, and lap our griefs in Heaven,"
4213,III.,"To souls through Prayer, dew, sleep, and dream, are given!"
4214,III.,"So bow'd, not broken, and with manly will,"
4215,III.,"Onwards he strode, slow up the labouring hill!"
4216,III.,
4217,III.,"If Lucy mourn'd his absence, not before"
4218,III.,Her sire's dim eyes the face of grief she wore;
4219,III.,Haply her woman heart divined the spell
4220,III.,"Of her own power, by flight proclaim'd too well;"
4221,III.,And not in hours like these may self control
4222,III.,The generous empire of a noble soul:
4223,III.,"Lo, her first thought, first duty--the soft reign"
4224,III.,Of Woman--patience by the bed of pain!
4225,III.,"As mute the father, yet to him made clear"
4226,III.,The cause of flight untold to Lucy's ear;
4227,III.,"Thus ran the lines that met, at morn, his eyes:--"
4228,III.,"""Farewell! my place a daughter now supplies!--"
4229,III.,"Thou hast pass'd the gates of Death, and bright once more"
4230,III.,Smile round thy steps the sunlight and the shore.
4231,III.,"Farewell; and if a soul, where hatred's gall"
4232,III.,"Melts into pardon that embalmeth all,"
4233,III.,Can with forgiveness bless thee;--from remorse
4234,III.,Can pluck the stone which interrupts the course
4235,III.,Of thought to God;--and bid the waters rest
4236,III.,"Calm in Heaven's smile,--poor fellow-man, be blest!"
4237,III.,"I, that can aid no more, now need an aid"
4238,III.,Against myself; by mine own thoughts dismay'd:
4239,III.,I dare not face thy child--I may not dare
4240,III.,To commune with my heart--thy child is there!
4241,III.,"I hear a voice that whispers hope, and start"
4242,III.,"In shame, to shun the tempter and depart."
4243,III.,"How vile the pardon that I yield would seem,"
4244,III.,If shaped and colour'd from the egoist's dream;
4245,III.,A barter'd compromise with thoughts that take
4246,III.,The path of conscience but for passion's sake--
4247,III.,If with the pardon I could say--'The Tomb
4248,III.,"Devours the Past, so let the Moment bloom,"
4249,III.,"And see Calantha's brother reconciled,"
4250,III.,"Kneel to Calantha's lover, for his child!'"
4251,III.,It may not be; sad sophists were our vain
4252,III.,"Desires, if Right were not a code so plain;"
4253,III.,"In good or ill leave casusits on the shelf,"
4254,III.,"'He never errs who sacrifices self!'"""
4255,III.,
4256,III.,"Great Natures, Arden, thy strange lot to know"
4257,III.,And lose!--twin souls thy mistress and thy foe!
4258,III.,"How flash'd they, high and starry, through the dull"
4259,III.,World's reeking air--earnest and beautiful!
4260,III.,"Erring perchance, and yet divinely blind,"
4261,III.,Such hero errors purify our kind!
4262,III.,One noble fault that springs from SELF'S disdain
4263,III.,"May oft more grace in Angel eyes obtain,"
4264,III.,"Than a whole life, without a seeming flaw,"
4265,III.,"Which served but Heaven, because of Earth in awe,"
4266,III.,"Which in each act has loss or profit weigh'd,"
4267,III.,And kept with Virtue the accounts of Trade!
4268,III.,"He too was born, lost Idler, to be great,"
4269,III.,"The sins that dwarf'd, he had a soul to hate."
4270,III.,"Ambition, Ease, Example had beguiled,"
4271,III.,And our base world in fawning had defiled;
4272,III.,"Yet still, contrasting all he _did_, he _dream'd_;"
4273,III.,And through the Wordling's life the Poet gleam'd.
4274,III.,His eye not blind to Virtue; to his ear
4275,III.,Still spoke the music of the banish'd sphere;
4276,III.,"Still in his thought the Ideal, though obscured,"
4277,III.,Shamed the rank meteor which his sense allured.
4278,III.,"Wreck if he was, the ruin yet betray'd"
4279,III.,The shatter'd fane for gods departed made;
4280,III.,"And still, through weeds neglected and o'erthrown,"
4281,III.,The blurr'd inscription show'd the altar-stone.
4282,III.,"So scorn'd he not, as folly or as pride,"
4283,III.,The lofty code which made the Indian's guide;
4284,III.,But from that hour a subtle change came o'er
4285,III.,"The thoughts he veil'd, the outward mien he wore;"
4286,III.,"A mournful, weary gloom, a pall'd distaste"
4287,III.,Of all the joys so warmly once embraced.
4288,III.,His eye no more _looks onward_. but its gaze
4289,III.,Rests where Remorse a life misspent surveys:
4290,III.,What costly treasures strew that waste behind;
4291,III.,What whirlwinds daunt the soul that sows the wind!
4292,III.,"By the dark shape of what he _is_, serene"
4293,III.,Stands the bright ghost of what he might have been:
4294,III.,"Here the vast loss, and there the worthless gain--"
4295,III.,"Vice scorn'd, yet woo'd, and Virtue loved in vain."
4296,III.,
4297,III.,"'Tis said, the Nightingale, who hears the thrill"
4298,III.,"Of some rich lute, made vocal by sweet skill,"
4299,III.,"To match the music strains its wild essay,"
4300,III.,"Feels its inferior art, and envying, pines away:"
4301,III.,"So, waked at last, and scarcely now confest,"
4302,III.,Pined the still Poet in the Worldling's breast!
4303,III.,"So with the Harmony of Good, compared"
4304,III.,Its lesser self--so languish'd and despair'd.
4305,III.,
4306,III.,"Awhile, from land to land he idly roved,"
4307,III.,And join'd life's movement with a heart unmoved.
4308,III.,"No more loud cities ring with Arden's name,"
4309,III.,"Applaud his faults, and call his fashion ""Fame!"""
4310,III.,"Disgust with all things robes him as he goes,"
4311,III.,"In that pale virtue, Vice, when weary, knows."
4312,III.,"Yet his, at least, one rescue from the past;"
4313,III.,"His, one sweet comfort--Lucy's love at last!"
4314,III.,That bed of pain o'er which she had watch'd and wept--
4315,III.,"That grave, where Love forgot its wrongs and slept--"
4316,III.,That touching sorrow and that still remorse
4317,III.,"Unlock'd her heart, and gave the stream its course."
4318,III.,"From her own grief, by griefs more dark beguiled,"
4319,III.,Rose the consoling Angel in the Child!
4320,III.,"Yet still the calm disease, whose mute decay"
4321,III.,"No leech arrests, crept gradual round its prey."
4322,III.,"Death came, came gently, on his daughter's breast,"
4323,III.,"Murm'ring, ""Remember where this dust should rest."""
4324,III.,They bear the last Lord of that haughty race
4325,III.,Where winds the wave round Mary's dwelling-place;
4326,III.,"And side by side (oh, be it in the sky"
4327,III.,As in the earth!)--the long-divided lie!
4328,III.,
4329,III.,Doth life's last act one wrong at least repair--
4330,III.,His nameless child to wealth at least the heir?
4331,III.,So Arden's will decreed--so sign'd the hand;
4332,III.,So ran the text--not so Law rules the land:
4333,III.,"""I do bequeath unto my _child_,""[Y]--that word"
4334,III.,Alone on strangers has the wealth conferr'd.
4335,III.,"O'erjoy'd Law's heirs the legal blunder read,"
4336,III.,And Justice cancels Nature from the deed.
4337,III.,O moral world! deal sternly if thou wilt
4338,III.,"With the warm weakness as the wily guilt,"
4339,III.,But spare the harmless! Wherefore shall the child
4340,III.,Be from the pale which shelters Crime exiled?
4341,III.,Why heap such barriers round the sole redress
4342,III.,Which sin can give to sinless wretchedness?
4343,III.,Why must the veriest stranger thrust aside
4344,III.,"Our flesh--our blood, because a name's denied?"
4345,III.,"Give all thou hast to whomsoe'er thou please,"
4346,III.,"Foe, alien, knave, as whim so Law decrees;"
4347,III.,"But if thy heart speaks, if thy conscience cries--"
4348,III.,"""I give my child""--the law thy voice belies;"
4349,III.,"Chicanery balks all effort that atones,"
4350,III.,And Justice robs the wretch that Nature owns!
4351,III.,
4352,III.,"So abject, so despoil'd, so penniless,"
4353,III.,"Stood thy love-born in the world's wilderness,"
4354,III.,"O Lord of lands and towers, and princely sway!"
4355,III.,"O Dust, from whom with breath has pass'd away"
4356,III.,The humblest privilege the beggar finds
4357,III.,In rags that wrap his infant from the winds!
4358,III.,
4359,III.,"In the poor hamlet where her grandsire died,"
4360,III.,"Where sleeps her mother by the magnate's side,"
4361,III.,"The orphan found a home. Her story known,"
4362,III.,Men's hearts allow the right men's laws disown.
4363,III.,"Though lost the birthright, and denied the name,"
4364,III.,Her pastor-grandsire's virtues shield from shame;
4365,III.,"Pity seeks kind pretext to pour its balms,"
4366,III.,And yields light toils that saves the pride from alms.
4367,III.,"A soft respect the orphan's steps attends,"
4368,III.,And the sharp thorn at least the rose defends.
4369,III.,"So flows o'ershadow'd, but not darksome by,"
4370,III.,Her life's lone stream--the banks admit the sky
4371,III.,"Day's quiet taskwork o'er, when Ev'ning grey"
4372,III.,"Lists the last carol on the quivering spray,"
4373,III.,"When lengthening shades reflect the distant hill,"
4374,III.,"And the near spire, upon the lullëd rill;"
4375,III.,Her sole delight with pensive step to glide
4376,III.,"Along the path that winds the wave beside,"
4377,III.,"A moment pausing on the bridge, to mark"
4378,III.,Perchance the moonlight vista through the dark:
4379,III.,Or watch the eddy where the wavelets play
4380,III.,"Round the chafed stone that checks their happy way,"
4381,III.,"Then onward stealing, vanish from the view,"
4382,III.,"Where the star shimmers on the solemn yew,"
4383,III.,As shade from earth and starlight from the sky

4471,III.,"entertained by the multitude. Plato remarked that few, even in"
4472,III.,"his day, had faith in the immortality of the soul; and indeed"
4473,III.,the Hades of the ancients was not for the Many. Amongst those
4474,III.,"condemned we find few criminals, except the old Titans, and such"

4488,III.,of birth!--Many and many a natural child has thus been robbed
4489,III.,and swindled out of his sole claim upon redress--his sole chance

4813,V.,"A sense though clear, too timid to refuse;"
4814,V.,"Yielding the course that it would fain pursue,"
4815,V.,Still to each guide that proffer'd it the clue;

4834,VI.,"Silent at first, at last the deeps o'er-flow'd."

4838,VI.,But on the opposing towers of Ruthven shone
4839,VI.,"The last sweet splendour, and when gradual gone,"
4840,VI.,Left to the space above that grand decay
4841,VI.,"The rosiest tints, and last to fade away."
4842,VI.,The Father mused; then with impulsive start
4843,VI.,"Turn'd and drew Constance closer to his heart,"

4865,VII.,Sobb'd out that grief which youth believes despair.
4866,VII.,Thenceforth her solitude was desolate;
4867,VII.,Forebodings chill'd her as a shade from Fate.
4868,VII.,At Ruthven's step her colour changed--and dread
4869,VII.,Hush'd her low voice: such signs his hope misled.
4870,VII.,"Hope, to its own vain dreams the idle seer,"
4871,VII.,"Whisper'd--""First love comes veil'd in virgin fear!"""

4903,VIII.,"He paused, and glanced on Constance--while his breast"
4904,VIII.,Heaved with the tumult which the lip represt.
4905,VIII.,"Till she, but looking on her father's face,"
4906,VIII.,"In his joy joyous,--sprang from his embrace,"
4907,VIII.,"Before the Benefactor paused, and bow'd;"

5917,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,
5918,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,This Poem was originally composed in very early youth. It was first
5919,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"published in 1831, and though unfortunately coupled with a very jejune"
5920,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,and puerile burlesque called 'The Siamese Twins' (which to my great
5921,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"satisfaction has been long since forgotten), it was honoured by a very"
5922,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"complimentary notice in the _Edinburgh Review_, and found general favour"
5923,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"with those who chanced to read it. In the present edition, although the"
5924,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"conception and the general structure remain the same, many passages have"
5925,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"been wholly re-written, and the diction throughout carefully revised,"
5926,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"and often materially altered. I have sought, in short, from an affection"
5927,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,for the subject (too partial it may be) to give to the ideas which
5928,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"visited me in the freshness of youth, whatever aid from expression they"
5929,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"could obtain in the taste and culture of mature manhood. No doubt,"
5930,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"however, faults of exuberance in form, as in fancy, still remain, and"
5931,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,betray the age in which we scarcely look beyond the Spring that delights
5932,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"us, nor comprehend that the multitude of the blossoms can be injurious"
5933,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"to the bearing of the tree. Nevertheless, such faults may find more"
5934,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"indulgence among my younger readers than those of an opposite nature,"
5935,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"incident to the style, closer and more compressed, which my present"
5936,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,theories of verse have led me to adopt in most of the poems I have
5937,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,composed of late years.
5938,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,
5939,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,It will be observed that the design of this poem is that of a picture.
5940,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,It is intended to portray the great Patriot Poet in the three cardinal
5941,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"divisions of life--Youth, Manhood, and Age. The first part is founded"
5942,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"upon the well-known, though ill-authenticated, tradition of the Italian"
5943,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,lady or ladies seeing Milton asleep under a tree in the gardens of his
5944,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"college, and leaving some tributary verses beside the sleeper. Taking"
5945,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"full advantage of this legend, and presuming to infer from Milton's"
5946,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,Italian verses (as his biographers have done before me) that in his tour
5947,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"through Italy he did not escape the influence of the master passion, I"
5948,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"have ventured to connect, by a single thread of romantic fiction, the"
5949,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,segments of a poem in which narrative after all is subservient to
5950,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,"description. This idea belongs to the temerity of youth, but I trust it"
5951,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,has been subjected to restrictions more reverent than those ordinarily
5952,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.,imposed on poetic licence.

6005,III.,With those that haunt that spirit-world--the brain?
6006,III.,"Can shapes material vie with forms of air,"
6007,III.,Nature with Phantasy?--O question vain!
6008,III.,"Lo, by the Dreamer, fresh from heavenly hands,"
6009,III.,Youth's dream-inspirer--Virgin Woman stands.
6010,III.,"She came, a stranger from the Southern skies,"
6011,III.,"And careless o'er the cloister'd garden stray'd,"
6012,III.,"Till, pausing, violets on the bank to cull,"
6013,III.,Over the Dreamer bent the Beautiful.
6014,III.,
6015,III.,"Silent, with lifted hand and lips apart,"

6017,III.,"Like purple Mænad fruits, when down the glade"
6018,III.,"Shoots the warm sunbeam,--into darksome glow"
6019,III.,Light kiss'd the ringlets wreathing brows of snow;
6020,III.,And softer than the rosy hues that flush
6021,III.,"Her native heaven, when Tuscan morns arise,"
6022,III.,"The sweet cheek brighten'd with the sweeter blush,"
6023,III.,As virgin love from out delighted eyes
6024,III.,Dawn'd as Aurora dawns.--
6025,III.,
6026,III.,"Thus look'd the maid,"
6027,III.,And still the sleeper dream'd beneath the shade.
6028,III.,
6029,III.,Image of Soul and Love! So Psyche crept
6030,III.,To the still chamber where her Eros slept;
6031,III.,"While the light gladden'd round his face serene,[A]"
6032,III.,"As light doth ever,--when Love first is seen."
6033,III.,
6034,III.,"Felt he the touch of her dark locks descending,"
6035,III.,"Or with his breath her breathing fused and blending,"
6036,III.,"That, like a bird we startle from the spray,"
6037,III.,Pass'd the light Sleep with sudden wings away?
6038,III.,"Sighing he woke, and waking he beheld;"
6039,III.,"The sigh was silenced, as the look was spell'd;"
6040,III.,"Look charming look, the love that ever lies"
6041,III.,"In human hearts, like light'ning in the air,"
6042,III.,"Flash'd in the moment from those meeting eyes,"
6043,III.,And open'd all the Heaven!

6045,III.,"O Youth, beware!"

6048,III.,
6049,III.,
6050,IV.,IV.
6051,IV.,
6052,IV.,And their eyes met--one moment and no more;
6053,IV.,Moment in time that centred years in feeling.
6054,IV.,"As when to Thetis, on her cavern'd shore,"
6055,IV.,"Knelt her young King,--he rose, and murmur'd, kneeling."
6056,IV.,"Low though the murmur, it dissolved the charm"
6057,IV.,Which had in silence chain'd the modest feet;
6058,IV.,And maiden shame and woman's swift alarm
6059,IV.,Crimson'd her cheek and in her pulses beat:
6060,IV.,"She turn'd, and, as a spell that leaves the place"
6061,IV.,"It fill'd with phantom beauty cold and bare,"
6062,IV.,She fled;--and over disenchanted space
6063,IV.,Rush'd back the common air!

6066,V.,V.
6067,V.,
6068,V.,"Time waned--and thoughts intense, and grave and high,"

6071,V.,That meteor blended with the morning beams.
6072,V.,"Time waned, and ripe became the long desire,"

6075,V.,"Yet trembling with the silver Mantuan lyre,"
6076,V.,To knightly arms by Tasso tuned anew:--
6077,V.,So the fair Pilgrim left his father's hearth.
6078,V.,"Into his soul he drunk the lofty lore,"
6079,V.,Floating like air around the clime of song;
6080,V.,"Beheld the starry sage,[B] what time he bore"
6081,V.,For truth's dear glory the immortal wrong;
6082,V.,Communed majestic with majestic minds;
6083,V.,And all the glorious wanderer heard or saw
6084,V.,"Or felt or learn'd or dream'd, were as the winds"
6085,V.,That swell'd the sails of his triumphant soul;
6086,V.,"As then, ev'n then, with ardour yet in awe,"

6093,VI.,"O'er such a spot as ye, I ween, might see,"
6094,VI.,"When basking in the summer's breathless noon,"
6095,VI.,With upward face beneath the drowsy tree;
6096,VI.,"While golden dreams the willing soul receives,"
6097,VI.,And Elf-land glimmers through the checkering leaves.
6098,VI.,
6099,VI.,"It was the evening--still it lay, and fair,"
6100,VI.,Lapp'd in the quiet of the lulling air;
6101,VI.,"Still, but how happy! like a living thing"
6102,VI.,All love itself--all love around it seeing;
6103,VI.,"And drinking from the earth, as from a spring,"
6104,VI.,The hush'd delight and essence of its being.
6105,VI.,And round the spot (a wall of glossy shade)
6106,VI.,The interlaced and bowering trees reposed;
6107,VI.,And through the world of foliage had been made
6108,VI.,"Green lanes and vistas, which at length were closed"
6109,VI.,"By fount, or fane, or statue white and hoar,"
6110,VI.,Startling the heart with the fond dreams of yore.
6111,VI.,"And near, half-glancing through its veil of leaves,"
6112,VI.,An antique temple stood in marble grace;
6113,VI.,"Where still, if fondly wise, the heart conceives"
6114,VI.,Faith in the lingering Genius of the Place:
6115,VI.,Seen wandering yet perchance at earliest dawn
6116,VI.,Or greyest eve--with Nymph or bearded Faun.
6117,VI.,"Dainty with mosses was the grass you press'd,"
6118,VI.,Through which the harmless lizard glancing crept.
6119,VI.,And--wearied infants on Earth's gentle breast--
6120,VI.,In every nook the little field-flowers slept.
6121,VI.,But ever when the soft air draws its breath
6122,VI.,"(Breeze is a word too rude), with half-heard sigh,"
6123,VI.,From orange-shrubs and myrtles--wandereth
6124,VI.,The Grove's sweet Dryad borne in fragrance by.
6125,VI.,And aye athwart the alleys fitfully
6126,VI.,Glanced the fond moth enamour'd of the star;
6127,VI.,"And aye, from out her watch-tower in the tree,"
6128,VI.,"The music which a falling leaf might mar,"
6129,VI.,So faint--so faëry seem'd it--of the bird
6130,VI.,Transform'd at Daulis thrillingly was heard.
6131,VI.,"And in the centre of that spot, which lay"
6132,VI.,"A ring embosom'd in the wood's embrace,"
6133,VI.,"A fountain, clear as ever glass'd the day,"
6134,VI.,Breathed yet a fresher luxury round the place;
6135,VI.,"But now it slept, as if its silver shower,"
6136,VI.,"And the wide reach of its aspiring sound,"
6137,VI.,Were far too harsh for that transparent hour:--
6138,VI.,Yet--like a gnome that mourneth underground--
6139,VI.,You caught the murmur of the rill which gave
6140,VI.,The well's smooth calm the passion of its wave;
6141,VI.,"Ev'n as man's heart that still, with secret sigh,"
6142,VI.,Stirs through each thought that would reflect the sky.

6153,VII.,And drinks Falernian--while the mellow air
6154,VII.,Heaved to the light swell of the amorous lute;

6184,VIII.,The march--but not the action--of the strife
6185,VIII.,Without;--and Sorrow coil'd around his hearth:
6186,VIII.,"The film, the veil, the shadow, and the night,"
6187,VIII.,Along those eyes which now in all survey
6188,VIII.,A tribute and a rapture;--the despite
6189,VIII.,Of Fortune wreak'd on his declining day;
6190,VIII.,The clouds slow-labouring upward round his heart;--

6821,I.,Its gay farewell to hospitable eaves
6822,I.,The swallow twitter'd in the autumn heaven;
6823,I.,"Dumb on the crisp earth fell the yellowing leaves,"
6824,I.,"Or, in small eddies, fitfully were driven"
6825,I.,Down the bleak waste of the remorseless air.
6826,I.,"Out, from the widening gaps in dreary boughs,"
6827,I.,"Alone the laurel smiled,--as freshly fair"
6828,I.,"As its own chaplet on immortal brows,"
6829,I.,"When Fame, indifferent to the changeful sun,"
6830,I.,"Sees waning races wither, and lives on.--"
6831,I.,An old man sate before that deathless tree
6832,I.,Which bloom'd his humble dwelling-place beside;
6833,I.,The last pale rose which lured the lingering bee
6834,I.,"To the low porch it scantly blossom'd o'er,"
6835,I.,Nipp'd by the frost-air had that morning died.
6836,I.,"The clock faint-heard beyond the gaping door,"
6837,I.,"Low as a death-watch, click'd the moments' knell;"
6838,I.,And through the narrow opening you might see
6839,I.,Uncertain foot-prints on the sanded floor
6840,I.,(Uncertain foot-prints which of blindness tell);
6841,I.,"The rude oak board, the morn's untasted fare;"
6842,I.,"The scatter'd volumes and the pillow'd chair,"

6849,II.,The old man felt the fresh air o'er him blowing
6850,II.,Waving thin locks from musing temples pale;
6851,II.,"Felt the quick sun through cloud and azure going,"
6852,II.,"And the light dance of leaves upon the gale,"
6853,II.,In that mysterious symbol-change of earth
6854,II.,"Which looks like death, though but restoring birth."
6855,II.,Seasons return; for him shall not return
6856,II.,"Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn."
6857,II.,"Whatever garb the mighty mother wore,"
6858,II.,Nature to him was changeless evermore.--
6859,II.,"List, not a sigh!--though fall'n on evil days,"
6860,II.,With darkness compass'd round--those sightless eyes
6861,II.,"Need not the sun; nightly he sees the rays,"
6862,II.,Nightly he walks the bowers of Paradise.
6863,II.,"High, pale, still, voiceless, motionless, alone,"
6864,II.,"Death-like in calm as monumental stone,"
6865,II.,"Lifting his looks into the farthest skies,"
6866,II.,He sate: And as when some tempestuous day
6867,II.,"Dies in the hush of the majestic eve,"
6868,II.,"So on his brow--where grief has pass'd away,"
6869,II.,Reigns that dread stillness grief alone can leave.

6871,II.,
6872,III.,III.
6873,III.,
6874,III.,"And while he sate, nor saw, nor sigh'd,--drew near"
6875,III.,A timorous trembling step;--from the far clime
6876,III.,"The Pilgrim Woman came: long year on year,"
6877,III.,"In brain-sick thought that takes no heed of time,"
6878,III.,How had she pined to gaze upon that brow
6879,III.,"Last seen in youth, when she was young:--AND NOW!"
6880,III.,And now! O words that make the sepulchre
6881,III.,Of all our Past! Life sheds no sadder tear
6882,III.,"Than, when recalling what the Hours inter"
6883,III.,"Of hopes, of passions, of the things that made"
6884,III.,"Our hearts once quicken with tumultuous bliss,"
6885,III.,"We feel what worlds within ourselves can fade,"

6892,IV.,"Thus as she stood and gazed, and noiseless wept,"
6893,IV.,Two young slight forms across the threshold crept
6894,IV.,"And reach'd the blind grey man, and kiss'd his hand,"
6895,IV.,And then a moment o'er his lips there stray'd
6896,IV.,"The old, familiar, sweet yet stately smile."
6897,IV.,"On either side the children took their stand,"
6898,IV.,And all the three were silent for awhile:
6899,IV.,"Till one, the gentler, whisper'd some soft word,"
6900,IV.,Mingling her young locks with that silvery hair;
6901,IV.,"And the old man the child's meek voice obey'd,"
6902,IV.,"Rose,--lingering yet to breathe the gladsome air--"
6903,IV.,Or catch the faint note of the neighbouring bird;
6904,IV.,"Then leaning on the two, his head he bow'd,"
6905,IV.,And from the daylight pensive pass'd away.
6906,IV.,"Sharp swept the wind, the thrush forsook the spray,"

9066,CROMWELL'S DREAM.,
9067,CROMWELL'S DREAM.,The conception of this Ode originated in a popular tradition of
9068,CROMWELL'S DREAM.,"Cromwell's earlier days. It is thus strikingly related by Mr. Forster,"
9069,CROMWELL'S DREAM.,"in his very valuable Life of Cromwell:--""He laid himself down, too"
9070,CROMWELL'S DREAM.,"fatigued in hope for sleep, when suddenly the curtains of his bed were"
9071,CROMWELL'S DREAM.,"slowly withdrawn by a gigantic figure, which bore the aspect of a woman,"
9072,CROMWELL'S DREAM.,"and which, gazing at him silently for a while, told him that he should,"
9073,CROMWELL'S DREAM.,"before his death, be the greatest man in England. He remembered when he"
9074,CROMWELL'S DREAM.,"told the story, and the recollection marked the current of his thoughts,"
9075,CROMWELL'S DREAM.,"_that the figure had not made mention of the word King_."" Alteration has"
9076,CROMWELL'S DREAM.,"been made in the scene of the vision, and the age of Cromwell."

9084,I.,"And a grey dusk--not darkness--reign'd around,"
9085,I.,Save where the phantom of a sudden star

9087,I.,"Where on the wold, the triple pathway cross'd,"
9088,I.,"A sturdy wanderer wearied, lone, and lost,"

9092,I.,Beneath the boughs he laid him down to rest.

9094,I.,"Meet for the ruder time when force was fame,"

9456,KING ARTHUR.,
9457,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
9458,PREFACE.,
9459,PREFACE.,"In prefixing to this poem a brief explanation of its design, I feel"
9460,PREFACE.,myself involuntarily compelled to refer to the more popular distinctions
9461,PREFACE.,"of Epic Fable, though I do not thereby presume to arrogate to my work"
9462,PREFACE.,that title of Epic which Time alone has the prerogative to confer.
9463,PREFACE.,
9464,PREFACE.,"Pope has, accurately and succinctly, defined the three cardinal"
9465,PREFACE.,"divisions of Epic Fable to consist in the Probable, the Allegorical,"
9466,PREFACE.,and the Marvellous. For the Probable is indispensable to the vital
9467,PREFACE.,"interest of the action, the Marvellous is the obvious domain of creative"
9468,PREFACE.,"invention, and the Allegorical is the most pleasing mode of insinuating"
9469,PREFACE.,"some subtler truth, or clothing some profounder moral."
9470,PREFACE.,
9471,PREFACE.,"I accept these divisions, because they conform to the simplest"
9472,PREFACE.,principles of rational criticism; and though their combination does not
9473,PREFACE.,"form an Epic, it serves at least to amplify the region and elevate the"
9474,PREFACE.,objects of Romance.
9475,PREFACE.,
9476,PREFACE.,"It has been my aim so to blend these divisions, that each may harmonize"
9477,PREFACE.,"with the other, and all conduce to the end proposed from the"
9478,PREFACE.,"commencement. I have admitted but little episodical incident, and none"
9479,PREFACE.,"that does not grow out of what Pope terms ""the platform of the story."""
9480,PREFACE.,For the marvellous agencies I have not presumed to make direct use of
9481,PREFACE.,that Divine Machinery which the war of the Christian Principle with the
9482,PREFACE.,"form of Heathenism might have suggested to the sublime daring of Milton,"
9483,PREFACE.,had he prosecuted his original idea of founding an heroic poem upon the
9484,PREFACE.,"legendary existence of Arthur;--and, on the other hand, the Teuton"
9485,PREFACE.,"Mythology, however imaginative and profound, is too unfamiliar and"
9486,PREFACE.,"obscure, to permit its employment as an open and visible agency;--such"
9487,PREFACE.,"reference to it as occurs, is therefore rather admitted as an"
9488,PREFACE.,"appropriate colouring to the composition, than made an integral part of"
9489,PREFACE.,"the materials of the canvas: and, not to ask from the ordinary reader an"
9490,PREFACE.,"erudition I should have no right to expect, the reference so made is in"
9491,PREFACE.,"the simplest form, and disentangled from the necessity of other"
9492,PREFACE.,information than a few brief notes will suffice to afford.
9493,PREFACE.,
9494,PREFACE.,"In taking my subject from chivalrous romance, I take, then, those"
9495,PREFACE.,agencies from the Marvellous which chivalrous romance naturally and
9496,PREFACE.,"familiarly affords--the Fairy, the Genius, the Enchanter: not wholly,"
9497,PREFACE.,"indeed, in the precise and literal spirit with which our nursery tales"
9498,PREFACE.,"receive those creations of Fancy through the medium of French Fabliaux,"
9499,PREFACE.,"but in the larger significations by which, in their conceptions of the"
9500,PREFACE.,"Supernatural, our fathers often implied the secrets of Nature. For the"
9501,PREFACE.,"Romance from which I borrow is the Romance of the North--a Romance, like"
9502,PREFACE.,"the Northern mythology, full of typical meaning and latent import. The"
9503,PREFACE.,gigantic remains of symbol-worship are visible amidst the rude fables of
9504,PREFACE.,"the Scandinavians, and what little is left to us of the earlier and more"
9505,PREFACE.,"indigenous literature of the Cymrians, is characterized by a mysticism"
9506,PREFACE.,profound with parable. This fondness for an interior or double meaning
9507,PREFACE.,is the most prominent attribute in that Romance popularly called The
9508,PREFACE.,"Gothic, the feature most in common with all creations that bear the"
9509,PREFACE.,stamp of the Northern fancy: we trace it in the poems of the
9510,PREFACE.,"Anglo-Saxons; it returns to us, in our earliest poems after the"
9511,PREFACE.,Conquest; it does not _originate_ in the Oriental genius (immemorially
9512,PREFACE.,"addicted to Allegory), but it instinctively _appropriates_ all that"
9513,PREFACE.,Saraconic invention can suggest to the more sombre imagination of the
9514,PREFACE.,North--it unites to the Serpent of the Edda the flying Griffin of
9515,PREFACE.,"Arabia, the Persian Genius to the Scandinavian Trold,--and wherever it"
9516,PREFACE.,"accepts a marvel, it seeks to insinuate a type. This peculiarity, which"
9517,PREFACE.,distinguishes the spiritual essence of the modern from the sensual
9518,PREFACE.,"character of ancient poetry, especially the Roman, is visible wherever a"
9519,PREFACE.,"tribe allied to the Goth, the Frank, or the Teuton, carries with it the"
9520,PREFACE.,deep mysteries of the Christian faith. Even in sunny Provence it
9521,PREFACE.,transfuses a subtler and graver moral into the lays of the joyous
9522,PREFACE.,"troubadour,[A]--and weaves ""The Dance of Death"" by the joyous streams,"
9523,PREFACE.,"and through the glowing orange-groves, of Spain. Onwards, this"
9524,PREFACE.,"under-current of meaning flowed, through the various phases of"
9525,PREFACE.,civilization:--it pervaded alike the popular Satire and the dramatic
9526,PREFACE.,"Mystery;--and, preserving its thoughtful calm amidst all the stirring"
9527,PREFACE.,"passions that agitated mankind in the age subsequent to the Reformation,"
9528,PREFACE.,"not only suffused the luxuriant fancy of the dreamy Spenser, but"
9529,PREFACE.,communicated to the practical intellect of Shakspere that subtle and
9530,PREFACE.,recondite wisdom which seems the more inexhaustible the more it is
9531,PREFACE.,"examined, and suggests to every new inquirer some new problem in the"
9532,PREFACE.,"philosophy of Human Life. Thus, in taking from Northern Romance the"
9533,PREFACE.,"Marvellous, we are most faithful to the genuine character of that"
9534,PREFACE.,"Romance, when we take with the Marvellous its old companion, the Typical"
9535,PREFACE.,or Allegorical. But these form only two divisions of the three which I
9536,PREFACE.,have assumed as the components of the unity I seek to accomplish; there
9537,PREFACE.,"remains the Probable, which contains the Actual. To subject the whole"
9538,PREFACE.,"poem to allegorical constructions would be erroneous, and opposed to the"
9539,PREFACE.,"vital principle of a work of this kind, which needs the support of"
9540,PREFACE.,direct and human interest. The inner and the outer meaning of Fable
9541,PREFACE.,"should flow together, each acting on the other, as the thought and the"
9542,PREFACE.,action in the life of a man. It is true that in order clearly to
9543,PREFACE.,"interpret the action, we should penetrate to the thought. But if we fail"
9544,PREFACE.,"of that perception, the action, though less comprehended, still"
9545,PREFACE.,"impresses its reality on our senses, and make its appeal to our"
9546,PREFACE.,interest.
9547,PREFACE.,
9548,PREFACE.,[A] Rien n'est plus commun dans la poésie provençale que
9549,PREFACE.,l'allégorie; seulement elle est un jeu-d'esprit an lieu d'être
9550,PREFACE.,une action.... Une autre analogie me parait plus spoutanée
9551,PREFACE.,"qu'imitée--la poésie des troubadours qu'on suppose frivole,"
9552,PREFACE.,"a souvent retracée des sentiments graves et touchants,"""
9553,PREFACE.,"&c.--VILLEMAIN, _Tableau du Moyen Age_."
9554,PREFACE.,
9555,PREFACE.,I have thus sought to maintain the Probable through that chain of
9556,PREFACE.,"incident in which human agencies are employed, and through those"
9557,PREFACE.,agencies the direct action of the Poem is accomplished; while the
9558,PREFACE.,Allegorical admits into the Marvellous the introduction of that subtler
9559,PREFACE.,"form of Truth, which if less positive than the Actual, is wider in its"
9560,PREFACE.,"application, and ought to be more profound in its significance."
9561,PREFACE.,
9562,PREFACE.,"For the rest, it may perhaps be conceded that this poem is not without"
9563,PREFACE.,originality in the conception of its plot and the general treatment of
9564,PREFACE.,its details. I am not aware of any previous romantic poem which it
9565,PREFACE.,"resembles in its main design, or in the character of its principal"
9566,PREFACE.,"incidents;--and, though I may have incurred certain mannerisms of my own"
9567,PREFACE.,"day, I yet venture to trust that, in the pervading form or style, the"
9568,PREFACE.,mind employed has been sufficiently in earnest to leave its own peculiar
9569,PREFACE.,"effigy and stamp upon the work. For the incidents narrated, I may,"
9570,PREFACE.,"indeed, thank the nature of my subject, if many of them could scarcely"
9571,PREFACE.,"fail to be new. The celebrated poets of chivalrous fable--Ariosto,"
9572,PREFACE.,"Tasso, and Spenser, have given to their scenery the colourings of the"
9573,PREFACE.,"West. The Great North from which Chivalry sprung--its polar seas, its"
9574,PREFACE.,"natural wonders, its wild legends, its antediluvian remains--(wide"
9575,PREFACE.,"fields for poetic description and heroic narrative)--have been, indeed,"
9576,PREFACE.,"not wholly unexplored by poetry, but so little appropriated, that even"
9577,PREFACE.,"after Tegner and Oehlenschläger, I dare to hope that I have found tracks"
9578,PREFACE.,"in which no poet has preceded me, and over which yet breathes the native"
9579,PREFACE.,air of our National Romance.
9580,PREFACE.,
9581,PREFACE.,"For the Manners preserved through this poem, I naturally reject those"
9582,PREFACE.,which the rigid Antiquary would appropriate to the date of that
9583,PREFACE.,"Historical Arthur, of whom we know so little, and take those of the age"
9584,PREFACE.,"in which the Arthur of Romance, whom we know so well, revived into"
9585,PREFACE.,fairer life at the breath of Minstrel and Fabliast. The anachronism of
9586,PREFACE.,"chivalrous manners and costume for the British chief and his Knighthood,"
9587,PREFACE.,is absolutely required by all our familiar associations. On the other
9588,PREFACE.,"hand, without affecting any precise accuracy in details, I have kept the"
9589,PREFACE.,country of the brave Prince of the Silures (or South Wales) somewhat
9590,PREFACE.,"more definitely in view, than has been done by the French Romance"
9591,PREFACE.,"writers; while in portraying his Saxon foes, I have endeavoured to"
9592,PREFACE.,"distinguish their separate nationality, without enforcing too violent a"
9593,PREFACE.,contrast between the rudeness of the heathen Teutons and the _polished
9594,PREFACE.,Christianity of the Cymrian Knighthood_.[B]
9595,PREFACE.,
9596,PREFACE.,"[B] In the more historical view of the position of Arthur, I"
9597,PREFACE.,"have, however, represented it such as it really appears to have"
9598,PREFACE.,"been,--not as the sovereign of all Britain, and the conquering"
9599,PREFACE.,invader of Europe (according to the groundless fable of Geoffrey
9600,PREFACE.,"of Monmouth), but as the patriot Prince of South Wales,"
9601,PREFACE.,"resisting successfully the invasion of his own native soil, and"
9602,PREFACE.,accomplishing the object of his career in preserving entire the
9603,PREFACE.,nationality of his Welsh countrymen. In thus contracting his
9604,PREFACE.,"sphere of action to the bounds of rational truth, his dignity,"
9605,PREFACE.,"both moral and poetic, is obviously enhanced. Represented as the"
9606,PREFACE.,"champion of all Britain against the Saxons, his life would have"
9607,PREFACE.,been but a notorious and signal failure; but as the preserver of
9608,PREFACE.,the Cymrian Nationality--of that part of the British population
9609,PREFACE.,"which took refuge in Wales, he has a claim to the epic glory of"
9610,PREFACE.,success.
9611,PREFACE.,
9612,PREFACE.,It is for this latter reason that I have gone somewhat out of
9613,PREFACE.,"the strict letter of history, in the poetical licence by which"
9614,PREFACE.,the Mercians are represented as Arthur's principal enemies
9615,PREFACE.,"(though, properly speaking, the Mercian kingdom was not then"
9616,PREFACE.,"founded): the alliance between the Mercian and the Welsh, which"
9617,PREFACE.,concludes the Poem--is at least not contrary to the spirit of
9618,PREFACE.,History--since in very early periods such amicable bonds between
9619,PREFACE.,"the Welsh and the Mercians were contracted, and the Welsh, on"
9620,PREFACE.,"the whole, were on better terms with those formidable borderers"
9621,PREFACE.,than with the other branches of the Saxon family.
9622,PREFACE.,
9623,PREFACE.,May I be permitted to say a word as to the metre I have selected?--One
9624,PREFACE.,"advantage it has,--that while thoroughly English, and not uncultivated"
9625,PREFACE.,"by the best of the elder masters, it has never been applied to a poem of"
9626,PREFACE.,"equal length, and has not been made too trite and familiar, by the"
9627,PREFACE.,lavish employment of recent writers.[C] Shakspere has taught us its
9628,PREFACE.,"riches in the Venus and Adonis,--Spenser in The Astrophel,--Cowley has"
9629,PREFACE.,sounded its music amidst the various intonations of his irregular lyre.
9630,PREFACE.,"But of late years, if not wholly laid aside, it has been generally"
9631,PREFACE.,"neglected for the more artificial and complicated Spenserian stanza,"
9632,PREFACE.,"which may seem, at the first glance, to resemble it, but which to the"
9633,PREFACE.,ear is widely different in rhythm and construction.
9634,PREFACE.,
9635,PREFACE.,"[C] Southey has used it in the ""Lay of the Laureate"" and ""The Poet's"
9636,PREFACE.,"Pilgrimage,""--not his best-known and most considerable poems."
9637,PREFACE.,
9638,PREFACE.,The reader may perhaps remember that Dryden has spoken with emphatic
9639,PREFACE.,"praise of the ""quatrain, or stanza of four in alternate rhyme."" He says"
9640,PREFACE.,"indeed, ""that he had ever judged it more noble, and of greater dignity,"
9641,PREFACE.,"both for the sound and number, than any other verse in use amongst us."""
9642,PREFACE.,"That metre, in its simple integrity, is comprised in the stanza"
9643,PREFACE.,"selected, ending in the vigour and terseness of the rhyming couplet,"
9644,PREFACE.,"with which, for the most part, the picture should be closed or the sense"
9645,PREFACE.,clenched. And whatever the imperfection of my own treatment of this
9646,PREFACE.,"variety in poetic form, I hazard a prediction that it will be ultimately"
9647,PREFACE.,"revived into more frequent use, especially in narrative, and that its"
9648,PREFACE.,"peculiar melodies of rhythm and cadence, as well as the just and"
9649,PREFACE.,"measured facilities it affords to expression, neither too diffuse nor"
9650,PREFACE.,"too restricted, will be recognized hereafter in the hands of a more"
9651,PREFACE.,accomplished master of our language.
9652,PREFACE.,
9653,PREFACE.,Here ends all that I feel called upon to say respecting a Poem which I
9654,PREFACE.,"now acknowledge as the child of my most cherished hopes, and to which I"
9655,PREFACE.,"deliberately confide the task to uphold, and the chance to continue, its"
9656,PREFACE.,father's name.

9679,NOTE.,initial. I prefix it--
9680,NOTE.,
9681,NOTE.,"First, to every substantive that implies a personification; thus War,"
9682,NOTE.,"Fame, &c, may in one line take the small initial as mere nouns, and in"
9683,NOTE.,"another line the capital initial, to denote that they are intended as"
9684,NOTE.,personifications. This rule is clear--all personifications may be said
9685,NOTE.,"to represent proper names: love, with a small l, means but a passion or"
9686,NOTE.,"affection; with a large L, Love represents some mythological power that"
9687,NOTE.,"presides over the passion or affection, and is as much a proper name as"
9688,NOTE.,"Venus, Eros, Camdeo, &c."
9689,NOTE.,
9690,NOTE.,"Secondly, I prefix the capital in those rare instances in which an"
9691,NOTE.,"adjective is used as a noun; as the Unknown, the Obscure,[D] &c. The"
9692,NOTE.,"capital here but answers the use of all printed inventions, in"
9693,NOTE.,"simplifying to the reader the author's meaning. If it be printed ""he"
9694,NOTE.,"passed through the obscure,"" the reader naturally looks for the noun"
9695,NOTE.,"that is to follow the adjective; if the capital initial be used, as ""He"
9696,NOTE.,"passed through the Obscure,"" the eye conveys to the mind without an"
9697,NOTE.,effort the author's intention to use the adjective as a substantive.
9698,NOTE.,
9699,NOTE.,"[D] So Pope, ""Spencer himself affects the Obsolete."""
9700,NOTE.,
9701,NOTE.,"Thirdly, I prefix the capital initial where it serves to give an"
9702,NOTE.,individual application to words that might otherwise convey only a
9703,NOTE.,general meaning; for instance--
9704,NOTE.,
9705,NOTE.,"""Or his who loves the madding Nymphs to lead"
9706,NOTE.,O'er the Fork'd Hill.
9707,NOTE.,
9708,NOTE.,"that is, the Forked Hill, _par emphasis_,--Parnassus."
9709,NOTE.,
9710,NOTE.,The use of the capital in these instances seems to me warranted by
9711,NOTE.,"common sense, and the best authorities in the minor niceties of our"
9712,NOTE.,language.
9713,NOTE.,
9714,NOTE.,"With regard to the other point referred to in the omitted note, I would"
9715,NOTE.,"observe, that I have deliberately used the freest licence in the rapid"
9716,NOTE.,"change of tense from past to present, or _vice versâ_; as a privilege"
9717,NOTE.,"essential to all ease, spirit, force, and variety, in narrative poetry;"
9718,NOTE.,"and warranted by the uniform practice of Pope, Dryden, and Milton. I"
9719,NOTE.,subjoin a few examples:--

9721,NOTE.,"""So _prayed_ they, innocent, and to their thoughts"
9722,NOTE.,Firm peace recover'd soon and wonted calm;

9802,NOTE.,
9803,NOTE.,I ask indulgence of the reader if I take this occasion to add a very
9804,NOTE.,short comment upon three objections to this poem which have been brought
9805,NOTE.,under my notice:--
9806,NOTE.,
9807,NOTE.,1--that it contains too much learning; 2--that it abounds too much with
9808,NOTE.,classical allusions; 3--that it indulges in rare words or archaisms.
9809,NOTE.,
9810,NOTE.,I wish I could plead guilty to the honourable charge that it contains
9811,NOTE.,"too much learning. A distinguished critic has justly observed, that the"
9812,NOTE.,greatest obstacle which the modern writer attempting an Epic would have
9813,NOTE.,"to encounter, would be, in his utter impossibility to attain the"
9814,NOTE.,requisite learning. For an Epic ought to embody the whole learning of
9815,NOTE.,the period in which it is composed; and in the present age that is
9816,NOTE.,beyond the aspiration of the most erudite scholar or the profoundest
9817,NOTE.,"philosopher. Still, any attempt at an Heroic Poem must at least comprise"
9818,NOTE.,"all the knowledge which the nature of the subject will admit, and we"
9819,NOTE.,cannot but observe that the greatest narrative poems are those in which
9820,NOTE.,the greatest amount of learning is contained. Beyond all comparison the
9821,NOTE.,"most learned poems that exist, in reference to the age in which they are"
9822,NOTE.,"composed, are the ""Iliad"" and ""Odyssey;"" next to them, the ""Paradise"
9823,NOTE.,"Lost;"" next to that, the ""Æneid,"" in which the chief charm of the"
9824,NOTE.,"six latter books is in that ""exquisite erudition,"" which Müller so"
9825,NOTE.,"discriminately admires in Virgil; and after these, in point of learning,"
9826,NOTE.,"come perhaps the ""Divine Comedy,"" and the ""Fairy Queen."" So that I have"
9827,NOTE.,"only to regret my deficiency of learning, rather than to apologize for"
9828,NOTE.,the excess of it.
9829,NOTE.,
9830,NOTE.,"With regard to the classical allusions which I have permitted myself,"
9831,NOTE.,I might shelter my practice under the mantles of our great masters in
9832,NOTE.,heroic song--Milton and Spenser; but in fact such admixture of the
9833,NOTE.,Classic with the Gothic muse is so essentially the characteristic of the
9834,NOTE.,"minstrelsy of the middle ages, that without a liberal use of the same"
9835,NOTE.,"combination, I could not have preserved the colouring proper to my"
9836,NOTE.,"subject. And, indeed, I think the advice which one of the most elegant"
9837,NOTE.,"of modern critics has given to the painter, is equally applicable to the"
9838,NOTE.,poet:--
9839,NOTE.,
9840,NOTE.,"""Non te igitur lateant antiqua numismata, gemmæ,"
9841,NOTE.,Quodque refert specie veterum post sæcula mentem;
9842,NOTE.,Splendidior quippe ex illis assurgit imago
9843,NOTE.,"Magnaque se rerum facies aperit meditanti.""[F]"
9844,NOTE.,
9845,NOTE.,[F] DU FRESNOY _de Arte Graphicâ_.
9846,NOTE.,
9847,NOTE.,"Lastly, the moderate use of archaisms has always been deemed admissible"
9848,NOTE.,"in a narrative poem of some length, and rather perhaps an ornament than"
9849,NOTE.,"a defect, where the action of the poem is laid in remote antiquity. And"
9850,NOTE.,"I may add that not only the revival of old, but the invention of new"
9851,NOTE.,"words, if sparingly resorted to, is among the least contestable of"
9852,NOTE.,"poetic licences--a licence freely recognized by Horace, elaborately"
9853,NOTE.,"maintained by Dryden, and tacitly sanctioned, age after age, by the"
9854,NOTE.,practice of every poet by whom our language has been enriched. I have
9855,NOTE.,"certainly not abused either of these privileges, for while I have only"
9856,NOTE.,"adopted three new words of foreign derivation, I do not think there are"
9857,NOTE.,a dozen words in the whole poem which can be considered archaisms: and
9858,NOTE.,in the three or four instances in which such words are not to be found
9859,NOTE.,"in Milton, Shakspere, or Spenser, they are taken from the Saxon element"
9860,NOTE.,"of our language, and are still popularly used in the northern parts of"
9861,NOTE.,"the island, in which that Saxon element is more tenaciously preserved."
9862,NOTE.,
9863,NOTE.,"If these matters do not seem to the reader of much importance, in"
9864,NOTE.,"reference to a poem of this design and extent, I will own to him"
9865,NOTE.,"confidentially, that I incline to his opinion. But I have met with no"
9866,NOTE.,"objections to the general composition of this work, more serious than"
9867,NOTE.,those to which the above remarks are intended to reply. Some objections
9868,NOTE.,to special lines or stanzas which appeared to me prompted by a juster
9869,NOTE.,"criticism, or which occurred to myself in reperusal, I have carefully"
9870,NOTE.,endeavoured in this edition to remove.

10774,NOTES TO BOOK I.,relating to the history of the Britons which are now no longer
10775,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"extant."""
10776,NOTES TO BOOK I.,
10777,NOTES TO BOOK I.,It would be extremely important towards tracing the origin of the
10778,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"Cymry, if authentic and indisputable records of such traditions of"
10779,NOTES TO BOOK I.,their migration from the East can be found in their own legends at
10780,NOTES TO BOOK I.,an age before learned conjecture could avail itself of the passages
10781,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"in Herodotus and Strabo, which relate to the Cimmerians, and tend"
10782,NOTES TO BOOK I.,to identify that people with our Cymrian ancestors. We find in the
10783,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"first (1. i. c. 14), that the Cimmerians, chased from their original"
10784,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"settlements by the Nomadic Scythians, came to Lydia, where they took"
10785,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"Sardis (except the citadel). In this account Strabo, on the authority"
10786,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"of Callisthenes and Callinus, confirms Herodotus."
10787,NOTES TO BOOK I.,
10788,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"In flying from their Scythian foes, the Cimmerians took their course"
10789,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"by the sea-coasts to Sinope, and the Cimmerian Bosphorus, and as,"
10790,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"after this flight, the old Cimmerian league was broken up, and the"
10791,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"tribes dispersed, this gives us the evident date for such migrations"
10792,NOTES TO BOOK I.,as Hu Gadarn is supposed to head; and the coincidence between Welch
10793,NOTES TO BOOK I.,traditions (if genuinely ancient) and classical authority becomes
10794,NOTES TO BOOK I.,very remarkable. For the additional corroboration of the hypothesis
10795,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"thus suggested, which is afforded by the identity between the"
10796,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"Cimmerians of Asia and the Cimbri of Gaul, see Strabo (1. vii. p."
10797,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"424, the Oxford edition, 1807). It is curious to note in Herodotus"
10798,NOTES TO BOOK I.,(1. iv. c. 11) that the same domestic feuds which destroyed the
10799,NOTES TO BOOK I.,Cymrian empire in Britain destroyed the Cimmerians in their original
10800,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"home. While the Scythians invaded them, they quarrelled amongst"
10801,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"themselves whether to fight or fly, and settled the dispute by"
10802,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"fighting each other, and flying from the enemy."

10823,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"Some liberty, in the course of this poem, will be taken with the"
10824,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"legendary character, less perhaps of the Gawaine of the Fabliaux,"
10825,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"than of the Gwalchmai (Hawk of Battle) of the Welch bards. In both,"
10826,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"indeed, this hero is represented as sage, courteous, and eloquent;"
10827,NOTES TO BOOK I.,but he is a livelier character in the Fabliaux than in the tales
10828,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"of his native land. The characters of many of the Cymrian heroes,"
10829,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"indeed, vary according to the caprice of the poets. Thus Kai, in the"
10830,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"Triads, one of the Three Diademed chiefs of battle and a powerful"
10831,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"magician, is, in the French romances, Messire Queux, the chief"
10832,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"of the cooks; and in the Mabinogion,[A] he is at one time but an"
10833,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"unlucky knight of more valour than discretion, and at another time"
10834,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"attains the dignity assigned to him in the Triads, and exults"
10835,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"in supernatural attributes. And poor Gawaine himself, the mirror"
10836,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"of chivalry, in most of the Fabliaux is, as Southey observes,"
10837,NOTES TO BOOK I.,"""shamefully calumniated"" in the MORT D'ARTHUR as the ""false Gawaine."""

12066,ARGUMENT.,"But thrice, to guide his comrades from the maze,                  32"
12067,ARGUMENT.,Rings through the echoing wood his lusty horn.
12068,ARGUMENT.,"Now, o'er waste pastures where the wild bulls graze,"
12069,ARGUMENT.,"Now labouring up slow-lengthening headlands borne,"
12070,ARGUMENT.,"The steadfast hounds outstrip the horseman's flight,"
12071,ARGUMENT.,And on the hill's dim summit fade from sight.
12072,ARGUMENT.,
12073,ARGUMENT.,"But scarcely fade, before, though faint and far,                  33"
12074,ARGUMENT.,Fierce wrathful yells the foe at bay reveal.
12075,ARGUMENT.,"On spurs the Saxon, till, like some pale star,"
12076,ARGUMENT.,Gleams on the hill a lance--a helm of steel.
12077,ARGUMENT.,"The brow is gain'd; a space of level land,"
12078,ARGUMENT.,Bare to the sun--a grove at either hand;
12079,ARGUMENT.,
12080,ARGUMENT.,And in the middle of the space a mound;                           34
12081,ARGUMENT.,And on the mound a knight upon his barb.
12082,ARGUMENT.,No need for herald there his tromp to sound!--
12083,ARGUMENT.,No need for diadem and ermine garb!
12084,ARGUMENT.,Nature herself has crown'd that lion mien;
12085,ARGUMENT.,And in the man the king of men is seen.
12086,ARGUMENT.,
12087,ARGUMENT.,"Upon his helmet sits a snow-white dove,                           35"
12088,ARGUMENT.,Its plumage blending with the plumèd crest.
12089,ARGUMENT.,"Below the mount, recoiling, circling, move"
12090,ARGUMENT.,"The ban-dogs, awed by the majestic rest"
12091,ARGUMENT.,"Of the great foe; and, yet with fangs that grin,"
12092,ARGUMENT.,"And eyes that redden, raves the madding din."
12093,ARGUMENT.,
12094,ARGUMENT.,"Still stands the steed; still, shining in the sun,                36"
12095,ARGUMENT.,"Sits on the steed the rider, statue-like:"
12096,ARGUMENT.,"One stately hand upon his haunch, while one"
12097,ARGUMENT.,"Lifts the tall lance, disdainful ev'n to strike;"
12098,ARGUMENT.,"Calm from the roar obscene looks forth his gaze,"
12099,ARGUMENT.,Calm as the moon at which the watch-dog bays.
12100,ARGUMENT.,
12101,ARGUMENT.,The Saxon rein'd his war-horse on the brow                        37
12102,ARGUMENT.,Of the broad hill; and if his inmost heart
12103,ARGUMENT.,"Ever confest to fear, fear touch'd it now;--"
12104,ARGUMENT.,Not that chill pang which strife and death impart
12105,ARGUMENT.,"To meaner men, but such religious awe"
12106,ARGUMENT.,As from brave souls a foe admired can draw:
12107,ARGUMENT.,
12108,ARGUMENT.,"Behind a quick and anxious glance he threw,                       38"
12109,ARGUMENT.,And pleased beheld spur midway up the hill
12110,ARGUMENT.,"His knights and squires: again his horn he blew,"
12111,ARGUMENT.,"Then hush'd the hounds, and near'd the slope where still"
12112,ARGUMENT.,"The might of Arthur rested, as in cloud"
12113,ARGUMENT.,"Rests thunder; there his haughty crest he bow'd,"
12114,ARGUMENT.,
12115,ARGUMENT.,"And lower'd his lance, and said--""Dread foe and lord,             39"
12116,ARGUMENT.,"Pardon the Saxon Harold, nor disdain"
12117,ARGUMENT.,To yield to warrior hand a kingly sword.
12118,ARGUMENT.,"Behold my numbers! to resist were vain,"
12119,ARGUMENT.,"And flight----"" Said Arthur, ""Saxon, is a word"
12120,ARGUMENT.,"Warrior should speak not, nor a King have heard."
12121,ARGUMENT.,
12122,ARGUMENT.,"""And, sooth to say, when Cymri's knights shall ride               40"
12123,ARGUMENT.,"To chase a Saxon monarch from the plain,"
12124,ARGUMENT.,"More knightly sport shall Cymri's king provide,"
12125,ARGUMENT.,And Cymrian tromps shall ring a nobler strain.
12126,ARGUMENT.,"Warrior, forsooth! when first went warrior, say,"
12127,ARGUMENT.,"With hound and horn--God's image for the prey?"""
12128,ARGUMENT.,
12129,ARGUMENT.,"Gall'd to the quick, the fiery earl erect                         41"
12130,ARGUMENT.,"Rose in his stirrups, shook his iron hand,"
12131,ARGUMENT.,"And cried--""ALFADER! but for the respect"
12132,ARGUMENT.,"Arm'd numbers owe to one, my Saxon brand"
12133,ARGUMENT.,"Should--but why words? Ho, Mercia to the field!"
12134,ARGUMENT.,"Lance to the rest!--yield, scornful Cymrian, yield!"""
12135,ARGUMENT.,
12136,ARGUMENT.,"For answer, Arthur closed his bassinet.                           42"
12137,ARGUMENT.,"Then down it broke, the thunder from that cloud!"
12138,ARGUMENT.,"And, ev'n as thunder by the thunder met,"
12139,ARGUMENT.,O'er his spurr'd steed broad-breasted Harold bow'd;
12140,ARGUMENT.,"Swift through the air the rushing armour flash'd,"
12141,ARGUMENT.,And tempests in the shock commingling clash'd!
12142,ARGUMENT.,
12143,ARGUMENT.,"The Cymrian's lance smote on the Mercian's breast,                43"
12144,ARGUMENT.,"Through the pierced shield,--there, shivering in the hand,"
12145,ARGUMENT.,"The dove had stirr'd not on the Prince's crest,"
12146,ARGUMENT.,"And on his destrier bore him to the band,"
12147,ARGUMENT.,"Which, moving not, but in a steadfast ring,"
12148,ARGUMENT.,With levell'd lances front the coming King.
12149,ARGUMENT.,
12150,ARGUMENT.,"His shiver'd lance thrown by, high o'er his head,                 44"
12151,ARGUMENT.,"Pluck'd from the selle, his battle-axe he shook--"
12152,ARGUMENT.,"Paused for an instant--breathed his foaming steed,"
12153,ARGUMENT.,And chose his pathway with one lightning look:
12154,ARGUMENT.,"On either side, behind the Saxon foes,"
12155,ARGUMENT.,Cimmerian woods with welcome gloom arose;
12156,ARGUMENT.,
12157,ARGUMENT.,"These gain'd, to conflict numbers less avail.                     45"
12158,ARGUMENT.,"He paused, and every voice cried--""Yield, brave King!"""
12159,ARGUMENT.,Scarce died the word ere through the wall of steel
12160,ARGUMENT.,"Flashes the breach, and backward reels the ring,"
12161,ARGUMENT.,"Plumes shorn, shields cloven, man and horse o'erthrown,"
12162,ARGUMENT.,As the arm'd meteor flames and rushes on.
12163,ARGUMENT.,
12164,ARGUMENT.,"Till then, the danger shared, upon his crest,                     46"
12165,ARGUMENT.,"Unmoved and calm, had sate the faithful dove,"
12166,ARGUMENT.,"Serene as, braved for some beloved breast,"
12167,ARGUMENT.,"All peril finds the gentle hero,--Love;"
12168,ARGUMENT.,"But rising now, towards the dexter side"
12169,ARGUMENT.,"Where darkest droop the woods, the pinions guide."
12170,ARGUMENT.,
12171,ARGUMENT.,"Near the green marge the Cymrian checks the rein,                 47"
12172,ARGUMENT.,"And, ev'n forgetful of the dove, wheels round,"
12173,ARGUMENT.,To front the foe that follows up the plain:
12174,ARGUMENT.,"So when the lion, with a single bound,"
12175,ARGUMENT.,"Breaks through Numidian spears,--he halts before"
12176,ARGUMENT.,"His den,--and roots dread feet that fly no more."
12177,ARGUMENT.,
12178,ARGUMENT.,"Their riven ranks reform'd, the Saxons move                       48"
12179,ARGUMENT.,"In curving crescent, close, compact, and slow"
12180,ARGUMENT.,Behind the earl; who feels a hero's love
12181,ARGUMENT.,Fill his large heart for that great hero foe:
12182,ARGUMENT.,"Murmuring, ""May Harold, thus confronting all,"
12183,ARGUMENT.,"Pass from the spear-storm to The Golden Hall!""[1]"
12184,ARGUMENT.,
12185,ARGUMENT.,"Then to his band--""If prophecy and sign                           49"
12186,ARGUMENT.,"Paling men's cheeks, and read by wizard seers,"
12187,ARGUMENT.,"Had not declared that Odin's threatened line,"
12188,ARGUMENT.,"And the large birthright of the Saxon spears,"
12189,ARGUMENT.,"Were cross'd by SKULDA,[2] in the baleful skein"
12190,ARGUMENT.,Of him who dares 'The Choosers of the Slain.'[3]
12191,ARGUMENT.,
12192,ARGUMENT.,"""If not forbid against his single arm                             50"
12193,ARGUMENT.,"Singly to try the even-sworded strife,"

12195,ARGUMENT.,"Hath made a host, the were-geld of his life--"
12196,ARGUMENT.,"Not ours this shame!--here one, and there a field,"
12197,ARGUMENT.,But men are waxen when the Fates are steel'd.
12198,ARGUMENT.,
12199,ARGUMENT.,"""Seize we our captive, so the gods command--                      51"
12200,ARGUMENT.,"But ye are men, let manhood guide the blow;"
12201,ARGUMENT.,"Spare life, or but with life-defending hand"
12202,ARGUMENT.,Strike--and Walhalla take that noble foe!
12203,ARGUMENT.,"Sound trump, speed truce.""--Sedately from the rest"

12205,ARGUMENT.,
12206,ARGUMENT.,"""Our steels have cross'd: hate shivers on the shield;             52"
12207,ARGUMENT.,"If the speech gall'd, the lance atones the word;"
12208,ARGUMENT.,"Yield, for thy valour wins the right to yield;"
12209,ARGUMENT.,"Unstain'd the scutcheon, though resign'd the sword."
12210,ARGUMENT.,"Grant us the grace, which chance (not arms) hath won"
12211,ARGUMENT.,"Why strike the many who would save the one?"""
12212,ARGUMENT.,
12213,ARGUMENT.,"""Fair foe, and courteous,"" answered Arthur, moved                 53"
12214,ARGUMENT.,"By that chivalric speech, ""too well the might"
12215,ARGUMENT.,"Of Mercia's famous Harold have I proved,"
12216,ARGUMENT.,To deem it shame to yield as knight to knight;
12217,ARGUMENT.,But a king's sword is by a nation given;
12218,ARGUMENT.,Who guards a people holds his post from heaven.
12219,ARGUMENT.,
12220,ARGUMENT.,"""This freedom which thou ask'st me to resign                      54"
12221,ARGUMENT.,Than life is dearer; were it but to show
12222,ARGUMENT.,That with my people thinks their King!--divine
12223,ARGUMENT.,"Through me all Cymri!--Streams shall cease to flow,"
12224,ARGUMENT.,"Yon sun to shine, before to Saxon strife"

12226,ARGUMENT.,
12227,ARGUMENT.,"""And so the saints assoil ye of my blood;                         55"

12229,ARGUMENT.,"And the just Heavens!"" All silent, Harold stood"
12230,ARGUMENT.,"And his heart smote him. Now, amidst that pause,"
12231,ARGUMENT.,"Arthur look'd up, and in the calm above"
12232,ARGUMENT.,Behold a falcon wheeling round the dove!
12233,ARGUMENT.,
12234,ARGUMENT.,For thus it chanced; the bird which Harold bore                   56
12235,ARGUMENT.,"(As was the Saxon wont), whate'er his way,"
12236,ARGUMENT.,"Had, in the woodland, slipp'd the hood it wore,"
12237,ARGUMENT.,"Unmark'd; and, when the bloodhounds bark'd at bay,"
12238,ARGUMENT.,"Lured by the sound, had risen on the wing,"
12239,ARGUMENT.,Over the conflict vaguely hovering--
12240,ARGUMENT.,
12241,ARGUMENT.,"Till when the dove had left, to guide, her lord,                  57"
12242,ARGUMENT.,It caught the white plumes glancing where they went;
12243,ARGUMENT.,"High in large circles to its height it soar'd,"
12244,ARGUMENT.,Swoop'd;--the light pinion foil'd the fierce descent;
12245,ARGUMENT.,The falcon rose rebounding to the prey;
12246,ARGUMENT.,And closed escape--confronting still the way.
12247,ARGUMENT.,
12248,ARGUMENT.,In vain the dove to Arthur seeks to flee;                         58
12249,ARGUMENT.,"Round her and round, with every sweep more near,"
12250,ARGUMENT.,"The swift destroyer circles rapidly,"
12251,ARGUMENT.,"Fixing keen eyes that fascinate with fear,"
12252,ARGUMENT.,"A moment--and a shaft, than wing more fleet,"
12253,ARGUMENT.,Hurls the pierced falcon at the Saxon's feet.
12254,ARGUMENT.,
12255,ARGUMENT.,Down heavily it fell;--a moment stirr'd                           59
12256,ARGUMENT.,"Its fluttering plumes, and roll'd its glazing eye;"
12257,ARGUMENT.,"But ev'n before the breath forsook the bird,"
12258,ARGUMENT.,"Ev'n while the arrow whistled through the sky,"
12259,ARGUMENT.,"Rush'd from the grove which screen'd the marksman's hand,"
12260,ARGUMENT.,"With yell and whoop, a wild barbarian band--"
12261,ARGUMENT.,
12262,ARGUMENT.,"Half clad, with hides of beast, and shields of horn,              60"
12263,ARGUMENT.,And huge clubs cloven from the knotted pine;
12264,ARGUMENT.,"And spears like those by Thor's great children borne,"
12265,ARGUMENT.,"When Cæsar bridged with marching[4] steel the Rhine,"
12266,ARGUMENT.,"Countless they start, as if from every tree"
12267,ARGUMENT.,Had sprung the uncouth defending deity;
12268,ARGUMENT.,
12269,ARGUMENT.,"They pass the King, low bending as they pass;                     61"
12270,ARGUMENT.,Bear back the startled Harold on their way;
12271,ARGUMENT.,"And roaring onward, mass succeeding mass,"
12272,ARGUMENT.,Snatch the hemm'd Saxons from the King's survey.
12273,ARGUMENT.,On Arthur's crest the dove refolds its wing;
12274,ARGUMENT.,"On Arthur's ear a voice comes murmuring,--"
12275,ARGUMENT.,
12276,ARGUMENT.,"""Man, have I served thy God?"" and Arthur saw                      62"
12277,ARGUMENT.,"The priest beside him, leaning on his bow;"
12278,ARGUMENT.,"""Not till, in all, thou hast fulfill'd the law--"
12279,ARGUMENT.,"Thou hast saved the friend--now aid to shield the foe;"""
12280,ARGUMENT.,"And as a ship, cleaving the sever'd tides,"
12281,ARGUMENT.,Right through the sea of spears the hero rides.
12282,ARGUMENT.,
12283,ARGUMENT.,The wild troop part submissive as he goes;                        63
12284,ARGUMENT.,"Where, like an islet in that stormy main,"
12285,ARGUMENT.,"Gleam'd Mercia's steel; and like a rock arose,"
12286,ARGUMENT.,"Breasting the breakers, the undaunted Thane;"
12287,ARGUMENT.,"He doff'd his helmet, look'd majestic round;"
12288,ARGUMENT.,And dropp'd the murderous weapon on the ground;
12289,ARGUMENT.,
12290,ARGUMENT.,And with a meek and brotherly embrace                             64
12291,ARGUMENT.,Twined round the Saxon's neck the peaceful arm.
12292,ARGUMENT.,"Strife stood arrested--the mild kingly face,"
12293,ARGUMENT.,"The loving gesture, like a holy charm,"
12294,ARGUMENT.,Thrill'd through the ranks: you might have heard a breath!
12295,ARGUMENT.,So did soft Silence seem to bury Death.
12296,ARGUMENT.,
12297,ARGUMENT.,"On the fair locks, and on the noble brow,                         65"
12298,ARGUMENT.,Fell the full splendour of the heavenly ray;
12299,ARGUMENT.,"The dove, dislodged, flew up--and rested now,"
12300,ARGUMENT.,Poised in the tranquil and translucent day.
12301,ARGUMENT.,The calm wings seem'd to canopy the head;
12302,ARGUMENT.,And from each plume a parting glory spread.
12303,ARGUMENT.,
12304,ARGUMENT.,So leave we that still picture on the eye;                        66
12305,ARGUMENT.,"And turn, reluctant, where the wand of Song"
12306,ARGUMENT.,Points to the walls of Time's long gallery:
12307,ARGUMENT.,And the dim Beautiful of Eld--too long
12308,ARGUMENT.,"Mouldering unheeded in these later days,"
12309,ARGUMENT.,"Starts from the canvass, bright'ning as we gaze."
12310,ARGUMENT.,
12311,ARGUMENT.,"O lovely scene which smiles upon my view,                         67"
12312,ARGUMENT.,As sure it smiled on sweet Albano's dreams;
12313,ARGUMENT.,He to whom Amor gave the roseate hue
12314,ARGUMENT.,And that harmonious colour-wand which seems
12315,ARGUMENT.,"Pluck'd from the god's own wing!--Arcades and bowers,"
12316,ARGUMENT.,"Mellifluous waters, lapsing amidst flowers,"
12317,ARGUMENT.,
12318,ARGUMENT.,"Or springing up, in multiform disport,                            68"
12319,ARGUMENT.,"From murmurous founts, delightedly at play;"
12320,ARGUMENT.,As if the Naiad held her joyous court
12321,ARGUMENT.,To greet the goddess whom the flowers obey;
12322,ARGUMENT.,"And all her nymphs took varying shapes in glee,"
12323,ARGUMENT.,Bell'd like the blossom--branching like the tree.
12324,ARGUMENT.,
12325,ARGUMENT.,Adown the cedarn alleys glanced the wings                         69
12326,ARGUMENT.,"Of all the painted populace of air,"
12327,ARGUMENT.,Whatever lulls the noonday while it sings
12328,ARGUMENT.,"Or mocks the iris with its plumes,--is there--"
12329,ARGUMENT.,"Music and air so interfused and blent,"
12330,ARGUMENT.,That music seems life's breathing element.
12331,ARGUMENT.,
12332,ARGUMENT.,And every alley's stately vista closed                            70
12333,ARGUMENT.,"With some fair statue, on whose gleaming base"
12334,ARGUMENT.,"Beauty, not earth's, benignantly reposed,"
12335,ARGUMENT.,As if the gods were native to the place;
12336,ARGUMENT.,"And fair indeed the mortal forms, I ween,"
12337,ARGUMENT.,Whose presence brings no discord to the scene!
12338,ARGUMENT.,
12339,ARGUMENT.,"Oh, fair they are, if mortal forms they be!                       71"
12340,ARGUMENT.,Mine eye the lovely error must beguile;
12341,ARGUMENT.,"So bloom'd the Hours, when from the heaving sea[5]"
12342,ARGUMENT.,Came Aphroditè to the rosy isle.
12343,ARGUMENT.,"What time they left Olympian halls above,"
12344,ARGUMENT.,To greet on earth their best beguiler--Love?
12345,ARGUMENT.,
12346,ARGUMENT.,Are they the Oreads from the Delphian steep                       72
12347,ARGUMENT.,Waiting their goddess of the silver bow?
12348,ARGUMENT.,"Or shy Napææ,[6] startled from their sleep,"
12349,ARGUMENT.,"Where blue Cithæron guards sweet vales below,"
12350,ARGUMENT.,"Watching as home, from vanquished Ind afar,"
12351,ARGUMENT.,Comes their loved Evian in the panther-car?
12352,ARGUMENT.,
12353,ARGUMENT.,Why stream ye thus from yonder arching bowers?                    73
12354,ARGUMENT.,"Whom wait, whom watch ye for, O lovely band,"
12355,ARGUMENT.,"With spears that, thyrsus-like, glance, wreath'd with flowers,"
12356,ARGUMENT.,"And garland-fetters, linking hand to hand,"
12357,ARGUMENT.,"And locks, from which drop blossoms on your way,"
12358,ARGUMENT.,Like starry buds from the loose crown of May?
12359,ARGUMENT.,
12360,ARGUMENT.,Behold how Alp on Alp shuts out the scene                         74
12361,ARGUMENT.,From all the ruder world that lies afar;
12362,ARGUMENT.,"Deep, fathom-deep, the valley which they screen;"
12363,ARGUMENT.,"Deep, as in chasms of cloud a happy star!"
12364,ARGUMENT.,What pass admits the stranger to your land?
12365,ARGUMENT.,"Whom wait, whom watch ye for, O lovely band?"
12366,ARGUMENT.,
12367,ARGUMENT.,"Ages ago, what time the barbarous horde,                          75"
12368,ARGUMENT.,"From whose rough bosoms sprang Imperial Rome,"
12369,ARGUMENT.,Drew the slow-widening circle of the sword
12370,ARGUMENT.,"Till kingdoms vanish'd in a robber's home,"
12371,ARGUMENT.,"A wise Etrurian chief, forewarn'd ('twas said)"
12372,ARGUMENT.,"By his dark Cære,[7] from the danger fled:"

12374,ARGUMENT.,"He left the vines of fruitful Fiesolè,                            76"
12375,ARGUMENT.,"Left, with his household gods and chosen clan,"
12376,ARGUMENT.,"Intent beyond the Ausonian bounds to flee,"
12377,ARGUMENT.,And Rome's dark shadow on the world of man.
12378,ARGUMENT.,So came the exiles to the rocky wall
12379,ARGUMENT.,"Which, centuries after, frown'd on Hannibal"

12384,ARGUMENT.,And give the ashes to the funeral cell;
12385,ARGUMENT.,"Slowly they gain'd the gulf, to scare away"
12386,ARGUMENT.,A vulture ravening on the mangled clay;
12387,ARGUMENT.,
12388,ARGUMENT.,"Smit by a javelin from the leader's hand,                         78"
12389,ARGUMENT.,"The bird crept fluttering down a deep defile,"
12390,ARGUMENT.,"Through whose far end faint glimpses of a land,"
12391,ARGUMENT.,"Sunn'd by a softer daylight, sent a smile;"
12392,ARGUMENT.,"The Augur hail'd an omen in the sight,"
12393,ARGUMENT.,And led the wanderers towards the glimmering light.
12394,ARGUMENT.,
12395,ARGUMENT.,"What seem'd a gorge was but a vista'd cave,                       79"
12396,ARGUMENT.,Long-drawn and hollow'd through primæval stone;
12397,ARGUMENT.,"Rude was the path, but as, beyond the grave"

12399,ARGUMENT.,Broadening and brightening--till their wonder sees
12400,ARGUMENT.,Bloom through the Alps the lost Hesperides.
12401,ARGUMENT.,
12402,ARGUMENT.,"There, the sweet sunlight, from the heights debarr'd,             80"
12403,ARGUMENT.,Gather'd its pomp to lavish on the vale;
12404,ARGUMENT.,"A wealth of wild sweets glitter'd on the sward,"
12405,ARGUMENT.,Screen'd by the very snow-rocks from the gale;
12406,ARGUMENT.,"Murmur'd clear waters, murmur'd joyous birds,"
12407,ARGUMENT.,And o'er soft pastures roved the fearless herds.
12408,ARGUMENT.,
12409,ARGUMENT.,"His rod the Augur waves above the ground,                         81"

12414,ARGUMENT.,Swift springs a sylvan city from the pine.
12415,ARGUMENT.,
12416,ARGUMENT.,What charm yet fails them in the lovely place?                    82
12417,ARGUMENT.,Childhood's gay laugh--and woman's tender smile.
12418,ARGUMENT.,A chosen few the venturous steps retrace;

12423,ARGUMENT.,"And with the objects of the dearer care,                          83"
12424,ARGUMENT.,The parting gifts of the old soil are home;

12431,ARGUMENT.,"Age rolls on age,--upon the antique world"
12432,ARGUMENT.,Full many a storm hath graved its thunder scars;
12433,ARGUMENT.,Tombs only speak the Etrurian's language;[9]--hurl'd
12434,ARGUMENT.,To dust the shrines of Naith;[10]--the serpents hiss
12435,ARGUMENT.,On Asia's throne in lorn Persepolis;
12436,ARGUMENT.,
12437,ARGUMENT.,The seaweed rots upon the ports of Tyre:                          85
12438,ARGUMENT.,On Delphi's steep the Pythian's voice is dumb;
12439,ARGUMENT.,Sad Athens leans upon her broken lyre;

12451,ARGUMENT.,"The soil's first fathers, with elaborate hands,                   87"
12452,ARGUMENT.,Had closed the rocky portals of the place;

12454,ARGUMENT.,"As tree on tree, so race succeeds to race,"
12455,ARGUMENT.,"From sleep the passions no temptations draw,"
12456,ARGUMENT.,And strife bows childlike to the patriarch's law;
12457,ARGUMENT.,
12458,ARGUMENT.,Lull'd was ambition; each soft lot was cast;                      88
12459,ARGUMENT.,Gold had no use; with war expired renown;
12460,ARGUMENT.,From priest to priest mysterious reverence past;
12461,ARGUMENT.,From king to king the mild Saturnian crown:
12462,ARGUMENT.,"Like dews, the rest came harmless into birth;"
12463,ARGUMENT.,Like dews exhaling--after gladd'ning earth.
12464,ARGUMENT.,
12465,ARGUMENT.,"Not wholly dead, indeed, the love of praise--                     89"
12466,ARGUMENT.,When can that warmth from heaven forsake the heart?
12467,ARGUMENT.,"The Hister's[11] lyre still thrill'd with Camsee's lays,"
12468,ARGUMENT.,"Still urn and statue caught the Arretian art,"
12469,ARGUMENT.,"And hands, least skill'd, found leisure still to cull"
12470,ARGUMENT.,"Some flowers, in offering to the Beautiful."
12471,ARGUMENT.,
12472,ARGUMENT.,Hence the whole vale one garden of delight;                       90
12473,ARGUMENT.,Hence every home a temple for the Grace:
12474,ARGUMENT.,Who worships Nature finds in Art the rite;
12475,ARGUMENT.,And Beauty grows the Genius of the Place.
12476,ARGUMENT.,Enough this record of the happy land:
12477,ARGUMENT.,"Whom watch, whom wait ye for, O lovely band?"
12478,ARGUMENT.,
12479,ARGUMENT.,"Listen awhile!--The strength of that soft state,                  91"
12480,ARGUMENT.,"The arch's key-stones, are the priest and king;"
12481,ARGUMENT.,"To guard all power inviolate from debate,"
12482,ARGUMENT.,"To curb all impulse, or direct its wing,"
12483,ARGUMENT.,In antique forms to mould from childhood all;--
12484,ARGUMENT.,_This_ guards more strongly than the Alpine wall.

12486,ARGUMENT.,"The regal chief might wed as choice inclined,                     92"
12487,ARGUMENT.,"Not so the daughters sprung from his embrace,"
12488,ARGUMENT.,"Law, strong as caste, their nuptial rite confined"
12489,ARGUMENT.,To the pure circle of the Lartian race;
12490,ARGUMENT.,"Hence with more awe the kingly house was view'd,"
12491,ARGUMENT.,Hence nipp'd ambition bore no rival feud.
12492,ARGUMENT.,
12493,ARGUMENT.,"But now, as on some eldest oak, decay                             93"
12494,ARGUMENT.,In the proud topmost boughs is serely shown;
12495,ARGUMENT.,While life yet shoots from every humbler spray--
12496,ARGUMENT.,"So, of the royal tribe one branch alone"
12497,ARGUMENT.,Remains; and all the honours of the race
12498,ARGUMENT.,Lend their last bloom to smile in Ægle's face.[12]
12499,ARGUMENT.,
12500,ARGUMENT.,The great arch-priest (to whom the laws assign                    94
12501,ARGUMENT.,"The charge of this sweet blossom from the bud),"
12502,ARGUMENT.,"Consults the annals archived in the shrine,"

12506,ARGUMENT.,
12507,ARGUMENT.,Rather than yield to rival tribes the hope                        95
12508,ARGUMENT.,That wakes aspiring thought and tempts to strife;
12509,ARGUMENT.,And (lowering awful reverence) rashly ope
12510,ARGUMENT.,"The pales that mark the set degrees of life,"
12511,ARGUMENT.,The priest (to whom the secret only known)
12512,ARGUMENT.,Unlock'd the artful portals of the stone;
12513,ARGUMENT.,
12514,ARGUMENT.,"And watch'd and lured some wanderer, o'er the steep,              96"
12515,ARGUMENT.,"Into the vale, return for ever o'er;"
12516,ARGUMENT.,"The gate, like Death's, reclosed upon the keep--"
12517,ARGUMENT.,Earth left its ghost as on the Funeral shore.
12518,ARGUMENT.,And what more envied lot could earth provide
12519,ARGUMENT.,Than calm Elysium--with a living bride?
12520,ARGUMENT.,
12521,ARGUMENT.,A priestly tale the simple flock deceived:                        97
12522,ARGUMENT.,The gods had care of their Tagetian child![13]
12523,ARGUMENT.,The nuptial garlands for a god they weaved;
12524,ARGUMENT.,"A god himself upon the maid had smiled,"
12525,ARGUMENT.,"A god himself renew'd the race divine,"
12526,ARGUMENT.,And gave new monarchs to the Lartian line.
12527,ARGUMENT.,
12528,ARGUMENT.,"Yet short, alas! the incense of delight                           98"
12529,ARGUMENT.,That lull'd the new-found Ammon of the Hour;
12530,ARGUMENT.,"Like love's own star, upon the verge of night,"
12531,ARGUMENT.,Trembled the torch that lit the bridal bower;
12532,ARGUMENT.,Soon as a son was born--his mission o'er--
12533,ARGUMENT.,The stranger vanish'd to his gods once more.
12534,ARGUMENT.,
12535,ARGUMENT.,"Two temples closed the boundaries of the place,                   99"
12536,ARGUMENT.,One (vow'd to Tina) in its walls conceal'd
12537,ARGUMENT.,"The granite portals, by the former race"
12538,ARGUMENT.,"So deftly fashion'd,--not a chink reveal'd"
12539,ARGUMENT.,Where (twice unbarr'd in all the ages flown)
12540,ARGUMENT.,The stony donjon mask'd the door of stone.
12541,ARGUMENT.,
12542,ARGUMENT.,The fane of Mantu[14] form'd the opposing bound                  100
12543,ARGUMENT.,Of the long valley; where the surplus wave
12544,ARGUMENT.,"Of the main stream a gloomy outlet found,"
12545,ARGUMENT.,"Split on sharp rocks beneath a night of cave,"
12546,ARGUMENT.,"And there, in torrents, down some lost ravine"
12547,ARGUMENT.,"Where Alps took root--fell heard, but never seen."
12548,ARGUMENT.,
12549,ARGUMENT.,Right o'er this cave the Death-Power's temple rose;              101
12550,ARGUMENT.,The cave's dark vault was curtain'd by the shrine;
12551,ARGUMENT.,Here by the priest (the sacred scrolls depose)
12552,ARGUMENT.,Was led the bridegroom when renew'd the line;
12553,ARGUMENT.,"At night, that shrine his steps unprescient trod--"
12554,ARGUMENT.,"And morning came, and earth had lost the god!"
12555,ARGUMENT.,
12556,ARGUMENT.,Nine days had now the Augur to the flock                         102
12557,ARGUMENT.,Announced the coming of the heavenly spouse;
12558,ARGUMENT.,"Nine days his steps had wander'd through the rock,"
12559,ARGUMENT.,"And his eye watch'd through unfamiliar boughs,"
12560,ARGUMENT.,And not a foot-fall in those rugged ways!
12561,ARGUMENT.,The lone Alps wearied on his lonely gaze--
12562,ARGUMENT.,
12563,ARGUMENT.,But now this day (the tenth) the signal torch                    103
12564,ARGUMENT.,Streams from the temple; the mysterious swell
12565,ARGUMENT.,Of long-drawn music peals from aisle to porch:--
12566,ARGUMENT.,"He leaves the bright hall where the Æsars[15] dwell,"
12567,ARGUMENT.,"He comes, o'er flowers and fountains to preside,"
12568,ARGUMENT.,"He comes, the god-spouse to the mortal bride--"
12569,ARGUMENT.,
12570,ARGUMENT.,"He comes, for whom ye watch'd, O lovely band,                    104"
12571,ARGUMENT.,Scatter your flowers before his welcome feet!
12572,ARGUMENT.,"Lo, where the temple's holy gates expand,"
12573,ARGUMENT.,"Haste, O ye nymphs, the bright'ning steps to meet"
12574,ARGUMENT.,Why start ye back?--What though the blaze of steel
12575,ARGUMENT.,"The form of Mars, the expanding gates reveal--"
12576,ARGUMENT.,
12577,ARGUMENT.,"The face, no helmet crowns with war, displays                    105"
12578,ARGUMENT.,Not that fierce god from whom Etruria fled;
12579,ARGUMENT.,"Cull from far softer legends while ye gaze,"
12580,ARGUMENT.,Not there the aspect mortal maid should dread!
12581,ARGUMENT.,Have ye no songs from kindred Castaly
12582,ARGUMENT.,"Of that bright Wanderer from the Olympian[16] sky,"
12583,ARGUMENT.,
12584,ARGUMENT.,"Who, in Arcadian dells, with silver lute                         106"
12585,ARGUMENT.,Hush'd in delight the nymph and breathless faun?
12586,ARGUMENT.,Or are your cold Etrurian minstrels mute
12587,ARGUMENT.,Of him whom Syria worshipp'd as the Dawn
12588,ARGUMENT.,"And Greece as fair Adonis? Hail, O hail!"
12589,ARGUMENT.,"Scatter your flowers, and welcome to the vale!"
12590,ARGUMENT.,
12591,ARGUMENT.,"Wondering the stranger moves! That fairy land,                   107"
12592,ARGUMENT.,"Those forms of dark yet lustrous loveliness,[17]"
12593,ARGUMENT.,That solemn seer who leads him by the hand;
12594,ARGUMENT.,"The tongue unknown, the joy he cannot guess,"
12595,ARGUMENT.,Blend in one marvel every sound and sight;
12596,ARGUMENT.,And in the strangeness doubles the delight.
12597,ARGUMENT.,
12598,ARGUMENT.,"Young Ægle sits within her palace bower,                         108"
12599,ARGUMENT.,She hears the cymbals clashing from afar--
12600,ARGUMENT.,So Ormuzd's music welcomed in the hour
12601,ARGUMENT.,When the sun hasten'd to his morning-star.
12602,ARGUMENT.,"Smile, Star of Morn--he cometh from above!"
12603,ARGUMENT.,And twilight melts around the steps of Love.
12604,ARGUMENT.,
12605,ARGUMENT.,Save the grey Augur (since the unconscious child                 109
12606,ARGUMENT.,Sprang to the last kiss of her dying sire)
12607,ARGUMENT.,"Those eyes by man's rude presence undefiled,"
12608,ARGUMENT.,Had deepen'd into woman's. As a lyre
12609,ARGUMENT.,"Hung on unwitness'd boughs, amidst the shade,"
12610,ARGUMENT.,And but to air her soul its music made.
12611,ARGUMENT.,
12612,ARGUMENT.,"Fair was her prison, wall'd with woven flowers,                  110"
12613,ARGUMENT.,"In a soft isle embraced by softest waters,"
12614,ARGUMENT.,"Linnet and lark the sentries to the towers,"
12615,ARGUMENT.,And for the guard Etruria's infant daughters;
12616,ARGUMENT.,"But stronger far than walls, the antique law,"
12617,ARGUMENT.,"And more than hosts, religion's shadowy awe."
12618,ARGUMENT.,
12619,ARGUMENT.,"Thus lone, thus reverenced, the young virgin grew                111"
12620,ARGUMENT.,"Into the age, when on the heart's calm wave"
12621,ARGUMENT.,"The light winds tremble, and emotions new"
12622,ARGUMENT.,Steal to the peace departing childhood gave;
12623,ARGUMENT.,"When for the vague Beyond the captive pines,"
12624,ARGUMENT.,And the soul misses--what it scarce divines.
12625,ARGUMENT.,
12626,ARGUMENT.,Lo where she sits--(and blossoms arch the dome)                  112
12627,ARGUMENT.,Girt by young handmaids!--Near and nearer swelling
12628,ARGUMENT.,The cymbals sound before the steps that come
12629,ARGUMENT.,O'er rose and hyacinth to the bridal dwelling;
12630,ARGUMENT.,And clear and loud the summer air along
12631,ARGUMENT.,From virgin voices floats the choral song.
12632,ARGUMENT.,
12633,ARGUMENT.,Lo where the sacred talismans diffuse                            113
12634,ARGUMENT.,Their fragrant charms against the Evil Powers;
12635,ARGUMENT.,Lo where young hands the consecrated dews
12636,ARGUMENT.,"From cuspèd vervain sprinkle round the flowers,"
12637,ARGUMENT.,"And o'er the robe, with broider'd palm-leaves sown,"
12638,ARGUMENT.,That decks the daughter of the peaceful throne!
12639,ARGUMENT.,
12640,ARGUMENT.,"Lo, on those locks of night the myrtle crown,                    114"
12641,ARGUMENT.,"Lo, where the heart beats quick beneath the veil;"
12642,ARGUMENT.,"Lo, where the lids, cast tremulously down,"
12643,ARGUMENT.,Cloud stars which Eros as his own might hail;
12644,ARGUMENT.,"Oh, lovelier than Endymion's loveliest dream,"
12645,ARGUMENT.,Joy to the heart on which those eyes shall beam!
12646,ARGUMENT.,
12647,ARGUMENT.,"The bark comes bounding to the islet shore,                      115"
12648,ARGUMENT.,The trellised gates fly back: the footsteps fall
12649,ARGUMENT.,Through jasmined galleries on the threshold floor;
12650,ARGUMENT.,"And, in the Heart-Enchainer's golden thrall,"
12651,ARGUMENT.,"There, spell-bound halt;--So, first since youth began"
12652,ARGUMENT.,Her eyes meet youth in the charm'd eyes of man!
12653,ARGUMENT.,
12654,ARGUMENT.,And there Art's two opposed Ideals rest;                         116
12655,ARGUMENT.,There the twin flowers of the old world bloom forth;
12656,ARGUMENT.,"The classic symbol of the gentle West,"
12657,ARGUMENT.,And the bold type of the chivalric North.
12658,ARGUMENT.,"What trial waits thee, Cymrian, sharper here"

12660,ARGUMENT.,
12661,ARGUMENT.,"But would ye learn how he we left afar,                          117"
12662,ARGUMENT.,"Girt by the stormy people of the wild,"
12663,ARGUMENT.,"Came to the confines of the Hesperus Star,"
12664,ARGUMENT.,And the soft gardens of the Etrurian child;

12667,ARGUMENT.,
12668,ARGUMENT.,"What there, forgetful of the vanish'd dove,                      118"
12669,ARGUMENT.,(Lost at these portals) did the king befall;
12670,ARGUMENT.,"Pause till the hand has tuned the harp to love,"

12778,NOTES TO BOOK III.,
12779,NOTES TO BOOK III.,The Etrurians paid more respect to women than most of the classical
12780,NOTES TO BOOK III.,"nations, and admitted females to the throne. The Augur (a purely"
12781,NOTES TO BOOK III.,Etruscan name and office) was the highest power in the state. In the
12782,NOTES TO BOOK III.,"earlier Etruscan history, the Augur and the king were unquestionably"
12783,NOTES TO BOOK III.,"united in one person. Latterly, this does not appear to have been"
12784,NOTES TO BOOK III.,necessarily (nor perhaps generally) the case. The king (whether we
12785,NOTES TO BOOK III.,"call him lars or lucumo), as well as the augur, was elected out of"
12786,NOTES TO BOOK III.,"a certain tribe, or clan; but in the strange colony described in the"
12787,NOTES TO BOOK III.,"poem, it is supposed that the rank has become hereditary in the family"
12788,NOTES TO BOOK III.,"of the chief who headed it, as would probably have been the case even"
12789,NOTES TO BOOK III.,"in more common-place settlements in another soil. Thus, the first"
12790,NOTES TO BOOK III.,"Etrurian colonist, Tarchun, no doubt had his successors in his own"
12791,NOTES TO BOOK III.,lineage.
12792,NOTES TO BOOK III.,
12793,NOTES TO BOOK III.,I cannot assert that Ægle is a purely Etruscan name; it is one common
12794,NOTES TO BOOK III.,both with the Greeks and Latins. In Apollodorus (ii. 5) it is given to
12795,NOTES TO BOOK III.,"one of the Hesperides, and in Virgil (Eclog. vi. l. 20) to the fairest"
12796,NOTES TO BOOK III.,"of the Naiads, the daughter of the sun; but it is not contrary"
12797,NOTES TO BOOK III.,"to the conformation of the Etruscan language, as, by the way, many"
12798,NOTES TO BOOK III.,"of the most popular Latinized Etruscan words are, such as _Lucumo_,"
12799,NOTES TO BOOK III.,"for Lauchme; and even Porsena, or, as Virgil (contrary to other"
12800,NOTES TO BOOK III.,"authorities) spells and pronounces it, Pors[~e]nna (a name which"
12801,NOTES TO BOOK III.,"has revived to fresh fame in Mr. Macaulay's noble ""Lays"") is a sad"
12802,NOTES TO BOOK III.,"corruption; for, as both Niebuhr and Sir William G. remark, the"
12803,NOTES TO BOOK III.,Etruscans had no _o_ in their language. Pliny informs us that they
12804,NOTES TO BOOK III.,supplied its place by the _v_. I apprehend that an Etrurian would
12805,NOTES TO BOOK III.,have spelt Porsena _Pvrsna_.[B]

13080,ARGUMENT.,"Allot, receive:--Here, shall thy wanderings end,"
13081,ARGUMENT.,"Here thy woes cease, and life's voluptuous day"
13082,ARGUMENT.,"Glide, like yon river through our flowers, away."""
13083,ARGUMENT.,
13084,ARGUMENT.,"""Kind sir,"" said Arthur, gratefully--""such lot                    30"
13085,ARGUMENT.,Indeed were fair beyond what dreams display;
13086,ARGUMENT.,"But earth has duties which""----""Relate them not!"""
13087,ARGUMENT.,"Exclaim'd the Augur--""or at least delay,"
13088,ARGUMENT.,"Till better known the kingdom and the bride,"
13089,ARGUMENT.,"Then youth, and sense, and nature, shall decide."""
13090,ARGUMENT.,
13091,ARGUMENT.,"With that, the Augur, much too wise as yet                        31"
13092,ARGUMENT.,"To hint compulsion, and secure from flight,"
13093,ARGUMENT.,"Arose, resolved each scruple to beset"
13094,ARGUMENT.,With all which melteth duty in delight--
13095,ARGUMENT.,"Here, for awhile, we leave the tempted King,"
13096,ARGUMENT.,And turn to him who owns the crystal ring.
13097,ARGUMENT.,
13098,ARGUMENT.,"Oh, the old time's divine and fresh romance!                      32"
13099,ARGUMENT.,When o'er the lone yet ever-haunted ways
13100,ARGUMENT.,"Went frank-eyed Knighthood with the lifted lance,"
13101,ARGUMENT.,And life with wonder charm'd adventurous days!
13102,ARGUMENT.,"When light more rich, through prisms that dimm'd it, shone;"
13103,ARGUMENT.,And Nature loom'd more large through the Unknown.
13104,ARGUMENT.,
13105,ARGUMENT.,"Nature, not then the slave of formal law!                         33"
13106,ARGUMENT.,Her each free sport a miracle might be:
13107,ARGUMENT.,Enchantment clothed the forest with sweet awe;
13108,ARGUMENT.,Astolfo[8] spoke from out the bleeding tree;
13109,ARGUMENT.,The fairy wreath'd his dance in moonlit air;
13110,ARGUMENT.,On golden sands the mermaid sleek'd her hair--
13111,ARGUMENT.,
13112,ARGUMENT.,Then soul learn'd more than barren sense can teach                34
13113,ARGUMENT.,(Soul with the sense now evermore at strife)
13114,ARGUMENT.,Wherever fancy wander'd man could reach--
13115,ARGUMENT.,And what is now call'd poetry was life.
13116,ARGUMENT.,"If the old beauty from the world is fled,"
13117,ARGUMENT.,Is it that Truth or that Belief is dead?
13118,ARGUMENT.,
13119,ARGUMENT.,"Not following, step by step, the devious King,                    35"
13120,ARGUMENT.,"But whither best his later steps are gain'd,"
13121,ARGUMENT.,"Moved the sure index of the fairy ring,"
13122,ARGUMENT.,"And since, at least, a moon hath wax'd and waned"
13123,ARGUMENT.,What time the pilgrim left the fatherland--
13124,ARGUMENT.,So towards his fresher footsteps veer'd the hand.
13125,ARGUMENT.,
13126,ARGUMENT.,"Lo, now where pure Sabrina[9] on her breast                       36"
13127,ARGUMENT.,"Hushes sweet Isca, and, like some fair nun"
13128,ARGUMENT.,"That yearns, earth-wearied, for the golden rest,"
13129,ARGUMENT.,Sees with delighted calm her journey done;
13130,ARGUMENT.,"And broader, brighter, as she nears her grave,"
13131,ARGUMENT.,Melts in the deep;--all daylight on the wave.
13132,ARGUMENT.,
13133,ARGUMENT.,"Across that stream pass'd sprightly Lancelot,                     37"
13134,ARGUMENT.,"Then, towards those lovely lands which yet retain"
13135,ARGUMENT.,"The Cymrian freedom, rode, and rested not"
13136,ARGUMENT.,"Till, loud on Devon, broke the rough'ning main."
13137,ARGUMENT.,"Through rocks abrupt, the strong waves force their way,"
13138,ARGUMENT.,"Here cleave the land--there, hew the indented bay."
13139,ARGUMENT.,
13140,ARGUMENT.,The horseman paused. Rude huts lay far and wide;                  38
13141,ARGUMENT.,The dipping sea-gulls wheel'd with startled shriek;
13142,ARGUMENT.,"Drawn on the sands lay coracles of hide,[10]"
13143,ARGUMENT.,"And all was desolate; when, towards the creek,"
13144,ARGUMENT.,"Near which he halts, he hears the plashing oar;"
13145,ARGUMENT.,A boat shoots in; the seamen leap to shore.
13146,ARGUMENT.,
13147,ARGUMENT.,"Three were their number,--two in youthful prime,                  39"
13148,ARGUMENT.,"One of mid years;--tall, huge of limb the three;"
13149,ARGUMENT.,"Scarce clad, with weapons of a northward clime;"
13150,ARGUMENT.,"Clubs, spears, and shields--the uncouth armoury"
13151,ARGUMENT.,"Of man, while yet the wild beast is his foe."
13152,ARGUMENT.,Yet something still the lords of earth may show;--
13153,ARGUMENT.,
13154,ARGUMENT.,"The pride of eye, the majesty of mien,                            40"
13155,ARGUMENT.,The front erect that looks upon the star:
13156,ARGUMENT.,While round each neck the twisted chains are seen
13157,ARGUMENT.,Of Teuton chiefs;--(and signs of chiefs they are
13158,ARGUMENT.,In Cymrian lands--where still the torque of gold[11]
13159,ARGUMENT.,Or decks the highborn or rewards the bold).
13160,ARGUMENT.,
13161,ARGUMENT.,Stern Lancelot frown'd; for in those sturdy forms                 41
13162,ARGUMENT.,The Christian Knight the Saxon foemen fear'd.
13163,ARGUMENT.,"""Why come ye hither?--nor compell'd by storms,"
13164,ARGUMENT.,"Nor proffering barter?"" As he spoke they near'd"
13165,ARGUMENT.,"The noble knight;--and thus the elder said,"
13166,ARGUMENT.,"""Nought save his heart the Aleman hath led!"
13167,ARGUMENT.,
13168,ARGUMENT.,"""Ere more I answer, say if this the shore,                        42"
13169,ARGUMENT.,"And thou the friend, of him who owns the dove?"
13170,ARGUMENT.,"Arthur the king,--who taught us to adore"
13171,ARGUMENT.,"By the man's deeds the God whose creed is love?"""
13172,ARGUMENT.,"Then Lancelot answer'd, with a moistening eye,"
13173,ARGUMENT.,"""Arthur's true knight and lealest friend am I."""
13174,ARGUMENT.,
13175,ARGUMENT.,"With that, he leapt from selle to clasp the hand                  43"
13176,ARGUMENT.,Of him who honour'd thus the absent one:
13177,ARGUMENT.,"And now behold them seated on the sand,"
13178,ARGUMENT.,Frank faces smiling in the cordial sun;
13179,ARGUMENT.,"The absent, there, seem'd present: to unite,"
13180,ARGUMENT.,"In loving bonds, his converts and his knight."
13181,ARGUMENT.,
13182,ARGUMENT.,Then told the Aleman the tale by song                             44
13183,ARGUMENT.,Already told--and we resume its flow
13184,ARGUMENT.,Where the mild hero charm'd the stormy throng
13185,ARGUMENT.,"And twined the arm that shelter'd, round his foe:"
13186,ARGUMENT.,Not meanly conquer'd but sublimely won--
13187,ARGUMENT.,Stern Harold vail'd his plume to Uther's son.
13188,ARGUMENT.,
13189,ARGUMENT.,"The Saxon troop resought the Vandal king,                         45"
13190,ARGUMENT.,And Arthur sojourn'd with the savage race:
13191,ARGUMENT.,More easy such rude proselytes to bring
13192,ARGUMENT.,"To Christian truth, than, in the wonderous place"
13193,ARGUMENT.,"Where now he rests, proud Wisdom he shall find!"
13194,ARGUMENT.,For heaven dawns clearest on the simplest mind.
13195,ARGUMENT.,
13196,ARGUMENT.,But when his cause of wrong the Cymrian show'd;                   46
13197,ARGUMENT.,The heathen foe--the carnage-crimson'd fields;
13198,ARGUMENT.,"With one fierce impulse those fierce converts glow'd,"
13199,ARGUMENT.,And their wild war-howl chimed with clashing shields
13200,ARGUMENT.,But Arthur wisely shunn'd that last appeal
13201,ARGUMENT.,"Of falling states,--the stranger's fatal steel."
13202,ARGUMENT.,
13203,ARGUMENT.,Yet to the chief (for there at least no fear)                     47
13204,ARGUMENT.,"And his two sons, a slow consent he gave:"
13205,ARGUMENT.,"Show'd by the prince the stars by which to steer,"
13206,ARGUMENT.,They hew'd a pine and launch'd it on the wave;
13207,ARGUMENT.,Bringing rough forms but dauntless hearts to swell
13208,ARGUMENT.,The force that guards the fates of Carduel.
13209,ARGUMENT.,
13210,ARGUMENT.,"The story heard, the son of royal BAN[12]                         48"
13211,ARGUMENT.,Questions the paths to which the King was led.
13212,ARGUMENT.,"""Know,"" answered Faul (so hight the Aleman),"
13213,ARGUMENT.,"""That, in our father's days, our warriors spread"
13214,ARGUMENT.,"O'er lands wherein eternal summer dwells,"
13215,ARGUMENT.,Beyond the snow-storm's siegeless pinnacles;
13216,ARGUMENT.,
13217,ARGUMENT.,"""And on the borders of those lands, 'tis told,                    49"
13218,ARGUMENT.,"There lies a lake, some dead great city's grave,"
13219,ARGUMENT.,"Where, when the moon is at her full, behold"
13220,ARGUMENT.,Pillar and palace shine up from the wave!
13221,ARGUMENT.,"And o'er the lake, seen but by gifted seers,"
13222,ARGUMENT.,Its phantom bark a silent phantom steers.
13223,ARGUMENT.,
13224,ARGUMENT.,"""It chanced, as round our fires we sate at night,                 50"
13225,ARGUMENT.,"And saga-runes to wile our watch were sung,"
13226,ARGUMENT.,That with the legends of our father's might
13227,ARGUMENT.,"And wandering labours, this old tale was strung,"
13228,ARGUMENT.,Then the roused King much question'd:--what we knew
13229,ARGUMENT.,"We told, still question from each answer grew."
13230,ARGUMENT.,
13231,ARGUMENT.,"""That night he slept not--with the morn was gone;                 51"
13232,ARGUMENT.,"And the dove led him where the snow-storms sleep."""
13233,ARGUMENT.,"Then Lancelot rose, and led his destrier on,"
13234,ARGUMENT.,"And gain'd the boat, and motion'd to the deep,"
13235,ARGUMENT.,"His purpose well the Alemen divine,"
13236,ARGUMENT.,And launch once more the bark upon the brine.
13237,ARGUMENT.,
13238,ARGUMENT.,"And ask to aid--""Know, friends,"" replied the knight,              52"
13239,ARGUMENT.,"""Each wave that rolleth smooths its frown for me;"
13240,ARGUMENT.,"My sire and mother, by the lawless might"
13241,ARGUMENT.,Of a fierce foe expell'd and forced to flee
13242,ARGUMENT.,"From the fair halls of BENOIC, paused to take"
13243,ARGUMENT.,"Breath for new woes, beside a Fairy's lake."
13244,ARGUMENT.,
13245,ARGUMENT.,"""With them was I, their new-born helpless heir,                   53"
13246,ARGUMENT.,"The hunted exiles gazed afar on home,"
13247,ARGUMENT.,And saw the fires that dyed like blood the air
13248,ARGUMENT.,Pall with the pomp of hell the crashing dome.
13249,ARGUMENT.,"They clung, they gazed--no word by either spoken;"
13250,ARGUMENT.,And in that hush the sterner heart was broken.
13251,ARGUMENT.,
13252,ARGUMENT.,"""The woman felt the cold hand fail her own;                       54"
13253,ARGUMENT.,The head that lean'd fell heavy on the sod;
13254,ARGUMENT.,"She knelt--she kiss'd the lips,--the breath was flown!"
13255,ARGUMENT.,She call'd upon a soul that was with God:
13256,ARGUMENT.,For the first time the wife's sweet power was o'er--
13257,ARGUMENT.,She who had soothed till then could soothe no more!
13258,ARGUMENT.,
13259,ARGUMENT.,"""In the wife's woe, the mother was forgot.                        55"
13260,ARGUMENT.,At last--(for I was all earth held of him
13261,ARGUMENT.,"Who had been all to her, and now was not)--"
13262,ARGUMENT.,"She rose, and look'd with tearless eyes, but dim,"
13263,ARGUMENT.,In the babe's face the father still to see;
13264,ARGUMENT.,And lo! the babe was on another's knee!--
13265,ARGUMENT.,
13266,ARGUMENT.,"""Another's lip had kiss'd it into sleep,                          56"
13267,ARGUMENT.,"And o'er the sleep another, watchful, smiled;--"
13268,ARGUMENT.,"The Fairy sate beside the lake's still deep,"
13269,ARGUMENT.,And hush'd with chanted charms the orphan child!
13270,ARGUMENT.,"Scared at the cry the startled mother gave,"
13271,ARGUMENT.,"It sprang, and, snow-like, melted in the wave."
13272,ARGUMENT.,
13273,ARGUMENT.,"""There, in calm halls of lucent crystalline,                      57"
13274,ARGUMENT.,"Fed by the dews that fell from golden stars,"
13275,ARGUMENT.,"But through the lymph I saw the sunbeams shine,"
13276,ARGUMENT.,Nor dream'd a world beyond the glist'ning spars;
13277,ARGUMENT.,"Buoy'd by a charm that still endows and saves,"
13278,ARGUMENT.,"In stream or sea, the nurseling of the waves."
13279,ARGUMENT.,
13280,ARGUMENT.,"""In my fifth year, to Uther's royal towers                        58"

13282,ARGUMENT.,My mother took the veil of Christ--the Hours
13283,ARGUMENT.,With Arthur's life the orphan's life entwined.
13284,ARGUMENT.,O'er mine own element my course I take--
13285,ARGUMENT.,"All oceans smile on Lancelot of the Lake!"""
13286,ARGUMENT.,
13287,ARGUMENT.,"He said, and waved his hand: around the boat                      59"
13288,ARGUMENT.,"The curlews hover'd, as it shot to sea."
13289,ARGUMENT.,"The wild men, lingering, watch'd the lessening float,"
13290,ARGUMENT.,"Till in the far expanse lost desolately,"
13291,ARGUMENT.,"Then slowly towards the hut they bent their way,"
13292,ARGUMENT.,And the lone waves moan'd up the lifeless bay.
13293,ARGUMENT.,
13294,ARGUMENT.,"Pass we the voyage. Hunger-worn, to shore                         60"
13295,ARGUMENT.,Gain'd man and steed; there food and rest they found
13296,ARGUMENT.,"In humble roofs. The course, resumed once more,"
13297,ARGUMENT.,Stretch'd inland o'er not unfamiliar ground:
13298,ARGUMENT.,"The wanderer smiles, by tower and town, to see"
13299,ARGUMENT.,Cymri's old oak rebloom in Brettanie.
13300,ARGUMENT.,
13301,ARGUMENT.,"Nathless, no pause, save such as needful rest                     61"
13302,ARGUMENT.,"Demands, delays him in the friendly land."
13303,ARGUMENT.,"No tidings here of Arthur gain'd, his breast"
13304,ARGUMENT.,"Springs to the goal of the quick-moving hand,"
13305,ARGUMENT.,"Howbeit not barren of adventurous days,"
13306,ARGUMENT.,Sweet danger found him in the devious ways.
13307,ARGUMENT.,
13308,ARGUMENT.,"What foes encounter'd, or what damsels freed--                    62"
13309,ARGUMENT.,"What demon spells in lonely forests braving,"
13310,ARGUMENT.,Leave we to songs yet vocal to the reed
13311,ARGUMENT.,"On ev'ry bank, beloved by poets, waving;"
13312,ARGUMENT.,"Our task unborrow'd from the muse of old,"
13313,ARGUMENT.,Takes but the tale by nobler bards untold.
13314,ARGUMENT.,
13315,ARGUMENT.,"Now as he journeys, frequent more and more                        63"
13316,ARGUMENT.,The traces of the steps he tracks are found;
13317,ARGUMENT.,"Fame, like a light, shines broadening on before"
13318,ARGUMENT.,"His path, and cleaves the shadows on the ground;"
13319,ARGUMENT.,"High deeds and gentle, bruited near and far,"
13320,ARGUMENT.,Show where that soul went flashing as a star.
13321,ARGUMENT.,
13322,ARGUMENT.,At length he gains the Ausonian Alpine walls;                     64
13323,ARGUMENT.,"Here, castle, convent, town, and hamlet fade;"
13324,ARGUMENT.,"Lone, through the rolling mists, the hoof-tread falls;"
13325,ARGUMENT.,"Lone, earth's mute giants loom amidst the shade:"
13326,ARGUMENT.,"Yet still, as sure of hope, he tracks the king,"
13327,ARGUMENT.,"Up steep, through gorge, where guides the crystal ring."
13328,ARGUMENT.,
13329,ARGUMENT.,One day--along by gloomy chasms his course--                      65
13330,ARGUMENT.,He saw before him indistinctly pass
13331,ARGUMENT.,"Through the dun fogs, what seem'd a phantom horse,"
13332,ARGUMENT.,"Like that which oft, amidst the dank morass,"
13333,ARGUMENT.,"Bestrid by goblin-meteor, starts the eye--"
13334,ARGUMENT.,So fleshless flitting--wan and shadowy.
13335,ARGUMENT.,
13336,ARGUMENT.,"By a bare rock it paused, and feebly neigh'd.                     66"
13337,ARGUMENT.,"As the good knight, descending, seized the rein;"
13338,ARGUMENT.,Dew-rusted mail the shrunken front array'd;
13339,ARGUMENT.,The rich selle rotted with the moulder-stain;
13340,ARGUMENT.,"And on the selle were slung helm, axe, and mace;"
13341,ARGUMENT.,And the great lance lay careless near the place.
13342,ARGUMENT.,
13343,ARGUMENT.,Then first the seeker's stricken spirit fell;                     67
13344,ARGUMENT.,"Too well that helmet, with its dragon crest,"
13345,ARGUMENT.,Speaks of the mighty owner; and too well
13346,ARGUMENT.,"That steed, so oft by snowy hands carest,"
13347,ARGUMENT.,When bright-eyed Beauty from the balcon bent
13348,ARGUMENT.,To crown the victor-lord of tournament.
13349,ARGUMENT.,
13350,ARGUMENT.,"Near and afar he searched--he called in vain,                     68"
13351,ARGUMENT.,"By crag and combe, nought answering, and nought seen;"
13352,ARGUMENT.,"Return'd, the charger long refused the rein,"
13353,ARGUMENT.,"Clinging, poor slave, where last its lord had been."
13354,ARGUMENT.,"At length the slow, reluctant hoofs obey'd"
13355,ARGUMENT.,The soothing words; so went they through the shade:
13356,ARGUMENT.,
13357,ARGUMENT.,"Following the gorge that wound the Alpine wall,                   69"
13358,ARGUMENT.,"Like the huge fosse of some Cyclopean town,"
13359,ARGUMENT.,"(While roaring round, invisible cataracts fall);"
13360,ARGUMENT.,"On the black rocks twilight comes ghostly down,"
13361,ARGUMENT.,"And deep and deeper still the windings go,"
13362,ARGUMENT.,And dark and darker as to worlds below.
13363,ARGUMENT.,
13364,ARGUMENT.,"Night halts the course, resumed at earliest day,                  70"
13365,ARGUMENT.,"Through day pursued, till the last sunbeams fell"
13366,ARGUMENT.,On a broad mere whose margin closed the way.
13367,ARGUMENT.,Hark! o'er the waters swung the holy bell
13368,ARGUMENT.,"From a grey convent on the rising ground,"
13369,ARGUMENT.,Amidst the subject hamlet stretch'd around.
13370,ARGUMENT.,
13371,ARGUMENT.,"Here, while both man and steeds the welcome rest                  71"
13372,ARGUMENT.,"Under the sacred roof of Christ receive,"
13373,ARGUMENT.,We turn once more to Ægle and her guest.
13374,ARGUMENT.,Lo! the sweet valley in the flush of eve!
13375,ARGUMENT.,"Lo! side by side, where through the rose-arcade,"
13376,ARGUMENT.,"Steals the love star, the hero and the maid!"
13377,ARGUMENT.,
13378,ARGUMENT.,"Silent they gaze into each other's eyes,                          72"
13379,ARGUMENT.,Stirring the inmost soul's unquiet sleep;
13380,ARGUMENT.,"So pierce soft star-beams, blending wave and skies,"
13381,ARGUMENT.,Some holy fountain trembling to its deep!
13382,ARGUMENT.,"Bright to each eye each human heart is bare,"
13383,ARGUMENT.,And scarce a thought to start an angel there!
13384,ARGUMENT.,
13385,ARGUMENT.,"Love to the soul, whate'er the harsh may say,                     73"
13386,ARGUMENT.,Is as the hallowing Naïad to the well--
13387,ARGUMENT.,The linking life between the forms of clay
13388,ARGUMENT.,And those ambrosia nurtures; from its spell
13389,ARGUMENT.,"Fly earth's rank fogs, and Thought's ennobled flow"
13390,ARGUMENT.,Shines with the shape that glides in light below.
13391,ARGUMENT.,
13392,ARGUMENT.,"Seize, O beloved, the blooms the Hour allows!                     74"
13393,ARGUMENT.,"Alas, but once can flower the Beautiful!"
13394,ARGUMENT.,"Hark, the wind rustles through the trembling boughs,"
13395,ARGUMENT.,And the stem withers while the buds ye cull!

13397,ARGUMENT.,"Can say, ""at least the Beautiful _was_ ours!"""
13398,ARGUMENT.,
13399,ARGUMENT.,Two loves (and both divine and pure) there are;                   75
13400,ARGUMENT.,"One by the roof-tree takes its root for ever,"
13401,ARGUMENT.,"Nor tempests rend, nor changeful seasons mar--"
13402,ARGUMENT.,It clings the stronger for the storm's endeavour;
13403,ARGUMENT.,"Beneath its shade the wayworn find their rest,"
13404,ARGUMENT.,And in its boughs the calm bird builds its nest.
13405,ARGUMENT.,
13406,ARGUMENT.,"But one more frail (in that more prized, perchance),              76"
13407,ARGUMENT.,Bends its rich blossoms over lonely streams
13408,ARGUMENT.,"In the untrodden ways of wild Romance,"
13409,ARGUMENT.,"On earth's far confines, like the Tree of Dreams,[13]"
13410,ARGUMENT.,Few find the path;--O bliss! O woe to find!
13411,ARGUMENT.,What bliss the blossom!--ah! what woe the wind!
13412,ARGUMENT.,
13413,ARGUMENT.,"Oh, the short spring!--the eternal winter!--All                   77"
13414,ARGUMENT.,"Branch,--stem all shatter'd; fragile as the bloom!"

13420,ARGUMENT.,"Before them, at the distance, o'er the blue                       78"
13421,ARGUMENT.,"Of the sweet waves which girt the rosy isle,"
13422,ARGUMENT.,Flitted light shapes the inwoven alleys through:

13427,ARGUMENT.,The calm swan rested on the breathless glass                      79
13428,ARGUMENT.,"Of dreamy waters, and the snow-white steer"
13429,ARGUMENT.,"Near the opposing margin, motionless,"

13432,ARGUMENT.,Where on the lucid darkness fell the star.
13433,ARGUMENT.,
13434,ARGUMENT.,"Near them, upon its lichen-tinted base,                           80"
13435,ARGUMENT.,Gleam'd one of those fair fancied images
13436,ARGUMENT.,"Which art hath lost--no god of Idan race,"

13446,ARGUMENT.,The only home of peace upon the earth.
13447,ARGUMENT.,
13448,ARGUMENT.,"And when, at last, from Ægle's lips, the voice                    82"
13449,ARGUMENT.,"Came soft as murmur'd hymns at closing day,"

13451,ARGUMENT.,"To give the sole charm wanting,--to convey"
13452,ARGUMENT.,The crowning music to the Musical;
13453,ARGUMENT.,As with the soul of love infusing all!
13454,ARGUMENT.,
13455,ARGUMENT.,"And to the Northman's ear that antique tongue,                    83"
13456,ARGUMENT.,"Which from the Augur's lips fell weird and cold,"
13457,ARGUMENT.,"Seem'd as the thread in fairy tales,[15] which strung"
13458,ARGUMENT.,"Enchanted pearls, won from the caves of old,"
13459,ARGUMENT.,And woven round a sunbeam;--so was wrought
13460,ARGUMENT.,O'er cordial love the pure and delicate thought.
13461,ARGUMENT.,
13462,ARGUMENT.,"She spoke of youth's lost years, so lone before,                  84"
13463,ARGUMENT.,"And coming to the present, paused and blush'd;"
13464,ARGUMENT.,"As if Time's wing were spell-bound evermore,"
13465,ARGUMENT.,"And Life, the restless, in the hour were hush'd:"
13466,ARGUMENT.,"The pause, the blush, said more than words, ""And thou"
13467,ARGUMENT.,"Art found!--thou lov'st me!--Fate is powerless now!"""
13468,ARGUMENT.,
13469,ARGUMENT.,That hand in his--that heart his own entwining                    85
13470,ARGUMENT.,"With its life's tendrils,--youth his pardon be,"
13471,ARGUMENT.,If in his heaven no loftier star were shining--

13476,ARGUMENT.,"Blame we as well the idlesse of a dream,                          86"
13477,ARGUMENT.,As that entranced oblivion from the reign
13478,ARGUMENT.,"Of the Great Curse, which glares in every beam"
13479,ARGUMENT.,Of labouring suns to the stern race of Cain;
13480,ARGUMENT.,"So life from earth did Nature here withdraw,"
13481,ARGUMENT.,That the strange peace seem'd but earth's common law.

13486,ARGUMENT.,The living palm God planted on the tomb!
13487,ARGUMENT.,"And so, and long, did Passion's subtle art"
13488,ARGUMENT.,Mask with the soul the impulse of the heart.
13489,ARGUMENT.,
13490,ARGUMENT.,Wonderous and lovely in that last retreat                         88
13491,ARGUMENT.,"Of the old Gods,--the simple speech to hear"
13492,ARGUMENT.,Tell of the Messenger whose beauteous feet

13504,ARGUMENT.,"Save where the moth strains to the moon its wing,                 90"
13505,ARGUMENT.,Deeming the Reachless near;--the prophet race
13506,ARGUMENT.,Of the cold stars forewarn'd them not; the Ring
13507,ARGUMENT.,"Of great Orion, who for the embrace"
13508,ARGUMENT.,"Of Morn's sweet Maid had died,[16] look'd calm above"

13515,ARGUMENT.,Their closing path the treacherous smile illumed;
13516,ARGUMENT.,And the stern Star-kings kiss'd the brows they doom'd.--
13517,ARGUMENT.,
13518,ARGUMENT.,'Tis morn once more; upon the shelving green                      92

13539,ARGUMENT.,"O'er the Man's temples fell the snows of age,                     95"

13545,ARGUMENT.,
13546,ARGUMENT.,"Hoarse croaks the bird, and, with its round bright eye,           96"
13547,ARGUMENT.,Fixes the gaze of the recoiling King;
13548,ARGUMENT.,"Slowly the hand, that trembles, cuts the tie"

13558,ARGUMENT.,In its rough course the great soul rush'd along.
13559,ARGUMENT.,
13560,ARGUMENT.,"As looks a warrior on the fort he scales,                         98"

13641,ARGUMENT.,(Its wanderings over) on calm summer eves
13642,ARGUMENT.,"Into its nest, amid the secret leaves?"
13643,ARGUMENT.,
13644,ARGUMENT.,What happy thought in those large tranquil eyes                  110
13645,ARGUMENT.,Speaks of a bliss remote from human fear?
13646,ARGUMENT.,Speaks of a soul which like a star supplies

13815,NOTES TO BOOK IV.,"maintained, as well as he could in his retreat, the knowledge common"
13816,NOTES TO BOOK IV.,among his priestly forefathers. The intercourse between Etruria and
13817,NOTES TO BOOK IV.,the Phoenician states (especially Carthage) was too considerable not
13818,NOTES TO BOOK IV.,to have rendered the language of the last familiar to the learning of

14845,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,Of the grey convent and the verdant creeks

14861,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,Three truths unite the children of the sod--

14863,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,
14864,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"By Ægle's grave the royal mourner sate,                          105"
14865,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,And from his bended eyes the veiling hand
14866,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Shut out the setting sun; thus, desolate,"
14867,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"He sate, with Memory in her spirit-land,"
14868,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"And took no heed of Lancelot's soothing words,"
14869,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Vain to the oak, bolt-shatter'd, sing the birds!"
14870,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,
14871,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,Vain is their promise of returning spring!                       106
14872,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Spring may give leaves, can spring reclose the core?"
14873,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,Comfort not sorrow--sorrow's self must bring
14874,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Its own stern cure!--All wisdom's holiest lore,"
14875,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"The ""KNOW THYSELF"" descends from heaven in tears;"
14876,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,The cloud must break before the horizon clears.

14878,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"The dove forsook not:--now its poisèd wing,                      107"
14879,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Bathed in the sunset, rested o'er the lake;"
14880,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,Now brooded o'er the grave beside the King;
14881,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Now with hush'd plumes, as if it fear'd to wake"
14882,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Sleep, less serene than Death's, it sought his breast,"
14883,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,And o'er the heart of misery claim'd its nest.
14884,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,
14885,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,Night falls--the moon is at her full;--the mere                  108
14886,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,Shines with the sheen pellucid; not a breeze!
14887,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,And through the hush'd and argent atmosphere
14888,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,Sharp rise the summits of the breathless trees.
14889,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"When Lancelot saw, all indistinct and pale,"
14890,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,Glide o'er the liquid glass a mistlike sail.
14891,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,
14892,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Now, first from Arthur's dreams of fever gain'd,                 109"
14893,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,And since (for grief unlocks the secret heart)
14894,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Briefly confess'd, the triple toil ordain'd"
14895,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,The knightly brother knew;--so with a start
14896,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"He strain'd the eyes, to which a fairy gave"
14897,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Vision of fairy forms, along the wave."
14898,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,
14899,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Then in his own the King's cold hand he took,                    110"
14900,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"And spoke--""Arise, thy mission calls thee now!"
14901,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Let the dead rest--still lives thy country!--look,"
14902,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,And nerve thy knighthood to redeem its vow.
14903,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"This is the lake whose waves the falchion hide,"
14904,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"And yon the bark that becks thee to the tide!"""
14905,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,
14906,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"The mourner listless rose, and look'd abroad,                    111"
14907,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Nor saw the sail;--though nearer, clearer gliding,"
14908,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"The Fairy nurseling, by the vapoury shroud"
14909,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"And vapoury helm, beheld a phantom guiding."
14910,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"""Not this,"" replied the King, ""the lake decreed;"
14911,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Where points thy hand, but floats a broken reed!"
14912,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,
14913,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"""Where are the dangers on that placid tide?                      112"
14914,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,Where are the fiends that guard the enchanted boon
14915,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Behold, where rests the pilgrim's plumèd guide"
14916,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,On the cold grave--beneath the quiet moon!
14917,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,So night gives rest to grief--with labouring day
14918,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Let the dove lead, and life resume, the way!"""
14919,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,
14920,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,Then answer'd Lancelot--for he was wise                          113
14921,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,In each mysterious Druid parable:--
14922,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"""Oft in the things most simple to our eyes,"
14923,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,The real genii of our doom may dwell--
14924,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,The enchanter spoke of trials to befal;
14925,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,And the lone heart has trials worse than all!
14926,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,
14927,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"""Weird triads tell us that our nature knows                      114"
14928,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,In its own cells the demons it should brave;
14929,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,And oft the calm of after glory flows
14930,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Clear round the marge of early passion's grave!"""
14931,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"And the dove came ere Lancelot ceased to speak,"
14932,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"To its lord's hand--a leaflet in its beak,"
14933,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,
14934,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,Pluck'd from the grave! Then Arthur's labouring thought          115
14935,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,Recall'd the prophet words--and doubt was o'er;
14936,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,He knew the lake that hid the boon he sought
14937,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Both by the grave, and by the herb it bore;"
14938,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"He took the bitter treasure from the dove,"
14939,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"And tasted Knowledge at the grave of Love,"
14940,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,
14941,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,And straight the film fell from his heavy eyes;                  116
14942,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"And moor'd beside the marge, he saw the bark,"
14943,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"And by the sails that swell'd in windless skies,"
14944,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,The phantom Lady in the robes of dark.
14945,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"O'er moonlit tracks she stretch'd the shadowy hand,"
14946,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"And lo, beneath the waters bloom'd the land!"
14947,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,
14948,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Forests of emerald verdure spread below,                         117"
14949,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Through which proud columns glisten far and wide,"
14950,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,On to the bark the mourner's footsteps go;
14951,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,The pale King stands by the pale phantom's side;
14952,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,And Lancelot sprang--but sudden from his reach
14953,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Glanced the wan skiff, and left him on the beach."
14954,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,
14955,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Chain'd to the earth by spells, more strong than love,           118"
14956,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"He saw the pinnace steal its noiseless way,"
14957,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"And on the mast there sate the steadfast dove,"
14958,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,With white plume shining in the steadfast ray--
14959,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,"Slow from the sight the airy vessel glides,"
14960,THE CHRISTIAN FUNERAL HYMN,Till Heaven alone is mirror'd on the tides.

17121,ARGUMENT.,"""Our hearts grew haunted by that patient face,                    18"

17145,ARGUMENT.,"To her the creed endear'd the champion's name,"

19376,ARGUMENT.,Hurls down an avalanche;--all the crater-cave
19377,ARGUMENT.,"Glows into swarthy red, and fire-showers leap"
19378,ARGUMENT.,"From rended summits, hissing to the wave"
19379,ARGUMENT.,"Through its hard ice; or in huge crags, wide-sounding"
19380,ARGUMENT.,Spring where they crash--on rushing and rebounding.
19381,ARGUMENT.,
19382,ARGUMENT.,"Dizzy and blind, the staggering Northmen fall                     68"
19383,ARGUMENT.,On earth that rocks beneath them like a bark;
19384,ARGUMENT.,Loud and more loud the tumult swells with all
19385,ARGUMENT.,The Acheron of the discord. Swift and dark
19386,ARGUMENT.,"From every cleft the smoke-clouds burst their way,"
19387,ARGUMENT.,"Rush through the void, and sweep from heaven the day."
19388,ARGUMENT.,
19389,ARGUMENT.,Smitten beneath the pestilential blast                            69
19390,ARGUMENT.,"And the great terror, senseless lay the band,"
19391,ARGUMENT.,"Till the arrested life, with throes at last,"
19392,ARGUMENT.,Gasp'd back: and holy over sea and land
19393,ARGUMENT.,Silence and light reposed. They look'd above
19394,ARGUMENT.,And calm in calmèd air beheld the Dove!
19395,ARGUMENT.,
19396,ARGUMENT.,And o'er their prostrate lord was poised the wing;                70
19397,ARGUMENT.,"And when they rush'd and reach'd him, shouting joy,"
19398,ARGUMENT.,There came no answer from the corpse-like King;
19399,ARGUMENT.,"And when his true knight raised him, heavily"
19400,ARGUMENT.,"Droop'd his pale front upon the faithful breast,"
19401,ARGUMENT.,And the closed lids seem'd leaden in their rest.
19402,ARGUMENT.,
19403,ARGUMENT.,"And all his mail was dinted, hewn, and crush'd,                   71"
19404,ARGUMENT.,And the bright falchion dim with foul dark gore;
19405,ARGUMENT.,And the strong pulse of the strong hand was hush'd;
19406,ARGUMENT.,"Like a spent storm, that might, which seem'd before"
19407,ARGUMENT.,"Charged with the bolts of Jove, now from the sky"
19408,ARGUMENT.,Drew breath more feeble than an infant's sigh.
19409,ARGUMENT.,
19410,ARGUMENT.,"And there was solemn change on that fair face,                    72"
19411,ARGUMENT.,"Nor, whatsoe'er the fear or scorn had been,"
19412,ARGUMENT.,Did the past passion leave its haggard trace;
19413,ARGUMENT.,"But on the rigid beauty awe was seen,"
19414,ARGUMENT.,As one who on the Gorgon's aspect fell
19415,ARGUMENT.,"Had gazed, and freezing, yet survived the spell!"
19416,ARGUMENT.,
19417,ARGUMENT.,"Not by the chasm in which he left the day,                        73"
19418,ARGUMENT.,"But through a new-made gorge the fires had cleft,"
19419,ARGUMENT.,"As if with fires themselves were forced the way,"
19420,ARGUMENT.,Had rush'd the King;--and sense and sinew left
19421,ARGUMENT.,The form that struggled till the strife was o'er:
19422,ARGUMENT.,So faints the swimmer when he gains the shore.
19423,ARGUMENT.,
19424,ARGUMENT.,But on his arm was clasp'd the wondrous prize:                    74
19425,ARGUMENT.,"Dimm'd, tarnish'd, grimed, and black with gore and smoke,"
19426,ARGUMENT.,"Still the pure metal, through each foul disguise,"
19427,ARGUMENT.,"Like starlight scatter'd on dark waters, broke;"
19428,ARGUMENT.,"Through gore, through smoke it shone--the silver Shield,"
19429,ARGUMENT.,Clear as dawns Freedom from her battle-field!
19430,ARGUMENT.,
19431,ARGUMENT.,"Days follow'd days, ere from that speechless trance               75"
19432,ARGUMENT.,(Borne to green inlets isled amid the snows
19433,ARGUMENT.,"Where led the Dove), the King's reviving glance"
19434,ARGUMENT.,"Look'd languid round on watchful, joyful brows;"
19435,ARGUMENT.,"Ev'n while he slept, new flowers the earth had given,"
19436,ARGUMENT.,And on his heart brooded the bird of heaven!
19437,ARGUMENT.,
19438,ARGUMENT.,"But ne'er as voice and strength and sense return'd,               76"
19439,ARGUMENT.,To his good knight the strife that won the Shield
19440,ARGUMENT.,Did Arthur tell; deep in his soul inurn'd
19441,ARGUMENT.,(As in the grave its secret) nor reveal'd
19442,ARGUMENT.,To mortal ear that mystery which for ever
19443,ARGUMENT.,"Flow'd through his thought, as through the cave a river;"
19444,ARGUMENT.,
19445,ARGUMENT.,"Whether to Love, how true soe'er its faith,                       77"
19446,ARGUMENT.,"Whether to Wisdom, whatsoe'er its skill,"
19447,ARGUMENT.,Till his last hour the struggle and the scath
19448,ARGUMENT.,Remain'd unutter'd and unutterable;
19449,ARGUMENT.,"But aye, in solitude, in crowds, in strife,"
19450,ARGUMENT.,"In joy, that memory lived within his life:"
19451,ARGUMENT.,
19452,ARGUMENT.,"It made not sadness, though the calm, grave smile                 78"
19453,ARGUMENT.,"Never regain'd the flash that youth had given,--"
19454,ARGUMENT.,But as some shadow from a sacred pile
19455,ARGUMENT.,"Darkens the earth from shrines that speak of heaven,"
19456,ARGUMENT.,"That gloom the grandeur of religion wore,"
19457,ARGUMENT.,And seem'd to hallow all it rested o'er.
19458,ARGUMENT.,
19459,ARGUMENT.,"Such Freedom is, O Slave, that would be free!                     79"
19460,ARGUMENT.,Never her real struggles into life
19461,ARGUMENT.,Hath History told! As it hath been shall be
19462,ARGUMENT.,The Apocalypse of Nations; nursed in strife
19463,ARGUMENT.,"Not with the present, nor with living foes,"
19464,ARGUMENT.,But where the centuries shroud their long repose.
19465,ARGUMENT.,
19466,ARGUMENT.,"Out from the graves of earth's primæval bones,                    80"
19467,ARGUMENT.,"The shield of empire, patient Force must win:"
19468,ARGUMENT.,What made the Briton free? not crashing thrones
19469,ARGUMENT.,Nor parchment laws. The charter must begin
19470,ARGUMENT.,"In Scythian tents, the steel of Nomad spears;"
19471,ARGUMENT.,"To date the freedom, count three thousand years!"
19472,ARGUMENT.,
19473,ARGUMENT.,"Neither is Freedom mirth! Be free, O slave,                       81"
19474,ARGUMENT.,And dance no more beneath the lazy palm.
19475,ARGUMENT.,"Freedom's mild brow with noble care is grave,"
19476,ARGUMENT.,Her bliss is solemn as her strength is calm;
19477,ARGUMENT.,And thought mature each childlike sport debars
19478,ARGUMENT.,The forms erect whose look is on the stars.
19479,ARGUMENT.,
19480,ARGUMENT.,"Now as the King revived, along the seas                           82"
19481,ARGUMENT.,"Flow'd back, enlarged to life, the lapsing waters;"
19482,ARGUMENT.,"Kiss'd from their slumber by the loving breeze,"
19483,ARGUMENT.,"Glide, in light dance, the Ocean's silver daughters--"
19484,ARGUMENT.,"And blithe and hopeful o'er the sunny strands,"
19485,ARGUMENT.,"Listing the long-lost billow, rove the bands."
19486,ARGUMENT.,
19487,ARGUMENT.,"At length, O sight of joy!--the gleam of sails                    83"
19488,ARGUMENT.,Bursts on the solitude! more near and near
19489,ARGUMENT.,Come the white playmates of the buxom gales.--
19490,ARGUMENT.,"The whistling cords, the sounds of man, they hear."
19491,ARGUMENT.,Shout answers shout;--light sparkles round the oar--
19492,ARGUMENT.,And from the barks the boat skims on to shore.
19493,ARGUMENT.,
19494,ARGUMENT.,"It was a race from Rugen's friendly soil,                         84"
19495,ARGUMENT.,"Leagued by old ties with Cymri's land and king,"
19496,ARGUMENT.,"Who, with the spring-time, to their wonted spoil"
19497,ARGUMENT.,Of seals and furs had spread the canvas wing
19498,ARGUMENT.,To bournes their fathers never yet had known;--
19499,ARGUMENT.,"And found, amazed, hearts bolder than their own."
19500,ARGUMENT.,
19501,ARGUMENT.,Soon to the barks the Cymrian and their bands                     85
19502,ARGUMENT.,"Are borne: Bright-hair'd, above the gazing crews,"
19503,ARGUMENT.,"Lone on the loftiest deck, the leader stands,"
19504,ARGUMENT.,To whom the King (his rank made known) renews
19505,ARGUMENT.,All that his tale of mortal hope and fear
19506,ARGUMENT.,Vouchsafes from truth to thrill a mortal's ear;
19507,ARGUMENT.,
19508,ARGUMENT.,"And from the barks whose sails the chief obey,                    86"
19509,ARGUMENT.,Craves one to waft where yet the fates may guide.--
19510,ARGUMENT.,"With rugged wonder in his large survey,"
19511,ARGUMENT.,"That calm grand brow the son of Ægir[8] eyed,"
19512,ARGUMENT.,"And seem'd in awe, as of a god, to scan"
19513,ARGUMENT.,"Him who so moved his homage, yet was man."
19514,ARGUMENT.,
19515,ARGUMENT.,"Smoothing his voice, rough with accustom'd swell                  87"
19516,ARGUMENT.,"Above the storms, and the wild roar of war,"
19517,ARGUMENT.,"The Northman answer'd, ""Skalds in winter tell"
19518,ARGUMENT.,"Of the dire dwarf who guards the Shield of Thor,"
19519,ARGUMENT.,"For one whose race, with Odin's blent, shall be,"
19520,ARGUMENT.,"Lords of the only realm which suits the Free,"
19521,ARGUMENT.,
19522,ARGUMENT.,"""Ocean!--I greet thee, and this strong right hand                 88"
19523,ARGUMENT.,Place in thine own to pledge myself thy man.
19524,ARGUMENT.,"Choose as thou wilt for thee and for thy band,"
19525,ARGUMENT.,Amongst the sea-steeds in the stalls of Ran.
19526,ARGUMENT.,Need'st thou our arms against the Saxon foe?
19527,ARGUMENT.,"Our flag shall fly where'er thy trumpets blow!"""
19528,ARGUMENT.,
19529,ARGUMENT.,"""Men to be free must free themselves,"" the King                   89"
19530,ARGUMENT.,"Replied, proud-smiling. ""Every father-land"
19531,ARGUMENT.,Spurns from its breast the recreant sons that cling
19532,ARGUMENT.,For hope to standards winds not theirs have fann'd.
19533,ARGUMENT.,Thankful through thee our foe we reach;--and then
19534,ARGUMENT.,"Cymri hath steel eno' for Cymrian men!"""
19535,ARGUMENT.,
19536,ARGUMENT.,"While these converse, Sir Gawaine, with his hound,                90"
19537,ARGUMENT.,Lured by a fragrant and delightsome smell
19538,ARGUMENT.,"From roasts--not meant for Freya,--makes his round,"
19539,ARGUMENT.,"Shakes hands with all, and hopes their wives are well."
19540,ARGUMENT.,"From spit to spit with easy grace he walks,"
19541,ARGUMENT.,And chines astounded vanish while he talks.
19542,ARGUMENT.,
19543,ARGUMENT.,"At earliest morn the bark to bear the King,                       91"
19544,ARGUMENT.,"His sage discernment delicately stores,"
19545,ARGUMENT.,Rejects the blubber and disdains the ling
19546,ARGUMENT.,"For hams of rein-deers and for heads of boars,"
19547,ARGUMENT.,"Connives at seal, to satisfy his men,"
19548,ARGUMENT.,But childless leaves each loud-lamenting hen.
19549,ARGUMENT.,
19550,ARGUMENT.,"And now the bark the Cymrian prince ascends,                      92"
19551,ARGUMENT.,"The large oars chiming to the chanting crew,"

19553,ARGUMENT.,From brazen trumpets blare their loud adieu.
19554,ARGUMENT.,"Forth bounds the ship, and Gawaine, while it quickens,"
19555,ARGUMENT.,The wind propitiates--with three virgin chickens.
19556,ARGUMENT.,
19557,ARGUMENT.,"Led by the Dove, more brightly day by day,                        93"
19558,ARGUMENT.,The vernal azure deepens in the sky;
19559,ARGUMENT.,Far from the Polar threshold smiles the way--
19560,ARGUMENT.,"And lo, white Albion shimmers on the eye,"
19561,ARGUMENT.,"Nurse of all nations, who to breasts severe"

19564,ARGUMENT.,Doubt and amaze with joy perplex the King:                        94
19565,ARGUMENT.,"Not yet the task achieved, the mission done,"
19566,ARGUMENT.,Why homeward steers the angel pilot's wing?
19567,ARGUMENT.,Of the three labours rests the crowning one;
19568,ARGUMENT.,Unreach'd the Iron Gates--Death's sullen hold--
19569,ARGUMENT.,Where waits the Child-guide with the locks of gold.
19570,ARGUMENT.,
19571,ARGUMENT.,Yet still the Dove cleaves homeward through the air;              95
19572,ARGUMENT.,Glides o'er the entrance of an inland stream;
19573,ARGUMENT.,"And rests at last on bowers of foliage, where"
19574,ARGUMENT.,"Thick forests close their ramparts on the beam,"
19575,ARGUMENT.,"And clasp with dipping boughs a grassy creek,"
19576,ARGUMENT.,Whose marge slopes level with the brazen beak.
19577,ARGUMENT.,
19578,ARGUMENT.,Around his neck the shield the Adventurer slung;                  96
19579,ARGUMENT.,"And girt the enchanted sword. Then, kneeling, said"

19600,ARGUMENT.,"And with dull murmur from its verdant waves,"
19601,ARGUMENT.,O'er his high crest the billowy forest swept.
19602,ARGUMENT.,As towards some fitful light the swimmer cleaves
19603,ARGUMENT.,"His stalwart way,--so through the woven shades"
19604,ARGUMENT.,Where the pale wing now glimmers and now fades.
19605,ARGUMENT.,
19606,ARGUMENT.,"With strong hand parting the tough branches, goes                100"
19607,ARGUMENT.,Hour after hour the King; till light at last
19608,ARGUMENT.,"From skies long hid, in ambient silver flows"
19609,ARGUMENT.,"Through opening glades, the length of gloom is past,"
19610,ARGUMENT.,And the dark pines receding stand around
19611,ARGUMENT.,A silent hill with antique ruins crown'd.
19612,ARGUMENT.,
19613,ARGUMENT.,Day had long closed; and from the mournful deeps                 101
19614,ARGUMENT.,"Of old volcanoes spent, the livid moon"

19624,ARGUMENT.,"Solving high riddles to Chaldean Mage,"
19625,ARGUMENT.,Or the young wonder of the Samian Sage.
19626,ARGUMENT.,
19627,ARGUMENT.,A date remounting far beyond the day                             103

19629,ARGUMENT.,When purer founts sublime had lapsed away

19664,ARGUMENT.,By fallen pillars laid him musing down.
19665,ARGUMENT.,"More large and large the moving shades advance,"

19683,ARGUMENT.,"That strange wild awe which haunted Childhood thrills,           111"
19684,ARGUMENT.,"When waking at the dead of Dark, alone,"

19686,ARGUMENT.,The blood;--a shrinking as from shapes unknown;

19776,NOTES TO BOOK X.,The testimony to be found in classical writers as to the original
19777,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"purity of the Druid worship, before it was corrupted into the idolatry"
19778,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"which existed in Britain at the time of the Roman conquest, is"
19779,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"strongly corroborated by the Welsh triads. These triads, indeed,"
19780,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"are of various dates, but some bear the mark of a very remote"
19781,NOTES TO BOOK X.,antiquity--wholly distinct alike from the philosophy of the Romans
19782,NOTES TO BOOK X.,and the mode of thought prevalent in the earlier ages of the Christian
19783,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"era; in short, anterior to all the recorded conquests over the Cymrian"
19784,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"people. These, like proverbs, appear the wrecks and fragments of some"
19785,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"primæval ethics, or philosophical religion. Nor are such remarkable"
19786,NOTES TO BOOK X.,alone for the purity of the notions they inculcate relative to the
19787,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"Deity; they have often, upon matters less spiritual, the delicate"
19788,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"observation, as well as the profound thought, of reflective wisdom. It"
19789,NOTES TO BOOK X.,is easy to see in them how identified was the Bard with the Sage--that
19790,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"rare union which produces the highest kind of human knowledge. Such,"
19791,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"perhaps, are the relics of that sublimer learning which, ages before"
19792,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"the sacrifice of victims in wicker idols, won for the Druids the"
19793,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"admiration of the cautious Aristotle, as ranking among the true"
19794,NOTES TO BOOK X.,enlighteners of men--such the teachers who (we may suppose to have)
19795,NOTES TO BOOK X.,instructed the mystical Pythagoras; and furnished new themes for
19796,NOTES TO BOOK X.,meditation to the musing Brahman. Nor were the Druids of Britain
19797,NOTES TO BOOK X.,inferior to those with whom the Sages of the western and eastern
19798,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"world came more in contact. On the contrary, even to the time of"
19799,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"Cæsar, the Druids of Britain excelled in science and repute those in"
19800,NOTES TO BOOK X.,Gaul; and to their schools the Neophytes of the Continent were sent.
19801,NOTES TO BOOK X.,
19802,NOTES TO BOOK X.,In the Stanzas that follow the description of the more primitive
19803,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"Cymrians, it is assumed that the rude Druid remains _now_ existent"
19804,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"(as at Stonehenge, &c.), are coeval only with the later and corrupted"
19805,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"state of a people degenerated to idol-worship, and that the Cymrians"
19806,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"previously possessed an architecture, of which no trace now remains,"
19807,NOTES TO BOOK X.,more suited to their early civilization. If it be true that they
19808,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"worshipped the Deity only in his own works, and that it was not until"
19809,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"what had been a symbol passed into an idol, that they deserted the"
19810,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"mountain-top and the forest for the temple, they would certainly have"
19811,NOTES TO BOOK X.,wanted the main inducement to permanent and lofty architecture. Still
19812,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"it may be allowed, at least to a poet, to suppose that men so sensible"
19813,NOTES TO BOOK X.,"as the primitive Saronides, would have held their schools and colleges"
19814,NOTES TO BOOK X.,in places more adapted to a northern climate than their favourite oak

20057,ARGUMENT.,Leaning against a broken parapet                                  27
20058,ARGUMENT.,"Alone with Thought, mused Caradoc the Bard,"
20059,ARGUMENT.,"When a voice smote him, and he turn'd and met"
20060,ARGUMENT.,A gaze prophetic in its sad regard.
20061,ARGUMENT.,"Beside him, solemn with his hundred years,"
20062,ARGUMENT.,Stood the arch hierarch of the Cymrian seers.
20063,ARGUMENT.,
20064,ARGUMENT.,"""Dost thou remember,"" said the Sage, ""that hour                   28"

20066,ARGUMENT.,"Thou heard'st the night bird in her leafy bower,"
20067,ARGUMENT.,"Singing sweet death-chaunts to her shining prey,"
20068,ARGUMENT.,"While thy young poet-heart, with ravish'd breath,"
20069,ARGUMENT.,"Hung on the music, nor divined the death?""[1]"
20070,ARGUMENT.,
20071,ARGUMENT.,"""Ay,"" the bard answer'd, ""and ev'n now methought                  29"

20073,ARGUMENT.,"""So,"" sigh'd the Prophet, ""to the bard, unsought,"
20074,ARGUMENT.,Come the far whispers of Futurity!
20075,ARGUMENT.,"Like his own harp, his soul a wind can thrill,"

20077,ARGUMENT.,
20078,ARGUMENT.,"""Wilt thou for ever, even from the tomb,                          30"

20080,ARGUMENT.,Arise and save thy country from its doom;
20081,ARGUMENT.,"Arise, Immortal, at the angel's call!"
20082,ARGUMENT.,"The hour shall give thee all thy life implor'd,"
20083,ARGUMENT.,And make the lyre more glorious than the sword.
20084,ARGUMENT.,
20085,ARGUMENT.,"""In vain through yon dull stupor of despair                       31"
20086,ARGUMENT.,Sound Geraint's tromp and Owaine's battle cry;
20087,ARGUMENT.,"In vain where yon rude clamour storms the air,"
20088,ARGUMENT.,The Council Chiefs stem madd'ning mutiny;
20089,ARGUMENT.,"From Trystan's mail the lion heart is gone,"
20090,ARGUMENT.,And on the breach stands Lancelot alone!
20091,ARGUMENT.,
20092,ARGUMENT.,"""Drivelling the wise, and impotent the strong;                    32"

20097,ARGUMENT.,"And teach to hosts the Bard's disdain of death!"""
20098,ARGUMENT.,
20099,ARGUMENT.,Thrill'd at that voice the soul of Caradoc;                       33
20100,ARGUMENT.,"He heard, and knew his glory and his doom."
20101,ARGUMENT.,As when in summer's noon the lightning shock
20102,ARGUMENT.,"Smites some fair elm in all its pomp of bloom,"
20103,ARGUMENT.,"'Mid whose green boughs each vernal breeze had play'd,"
20104,ARGUMENT.,And air's sweet race melodious homes had made;
20105,ARGUMENT.,
20106,ARGUMENT.,So that young life bow'd sad beneath the stroke                   34
20107,ARGUMENT.,"That sear'd the Fresh and still'd the Musical,"
20108,ARGUMENT.,Yet on the sadness Thought sublimely broke:
20109,ARGUMENT.,Holy the tree on which the bolt doth fall!
20110,ARGUMENT.,"Wild flowers shall spring the sacred roots around,"
20111,ARGUMENT.,And nightly fairies tread the haunted ground;
20112,ARGUMENT.,
20113,ARGUMENT.,"There, age by age, shall youth with musing brow,                  35"
20114,ARGUMENT.,Hear Legend murmuring of the days of yore;
20115,ARGUMENT.,"There, virgin love more lasting deem the vow"
20116,ARGUMENT.,Breathed in the shade of branches green no more;
20117,ARGUMENT.,And kind Religion keep the grand decay
20118,ARGUMENT.,Still on the earth while forests pass away.
20119,ARGUMENT.,
20120,ARGUMENT.,"""So be it, O voice from Heaven,"" the Bard replied,                36"
20121,ARGUMENT.,"""Some grateful tears may yet embalm my name,"
20122,ARGUMENT.,Ever for human love my youth hath sigh'd
20123,ARGUMENT.,And human love's divinest form is fame.
20124,ARGUMENT.,Is the dream erring? shall the song remain?
20125,ARGUMENT.,"Say, can one Poet ever live in vain?"""
20126,ARGUMENT.,
20127,ARGUMENT.,"As the warm south on some unfathom'd sea,                         37"
20128,ARGUMENT.,"Along the Magian's soul, the awful rest"
20129,ARGUMENT.,Stirr'd with the soft emotion: tenderly
20130,ARGUMENT.,"He laid his hand upon the brows he blest,"
20131,ARGUMENT.,"And said, ""Complete beneath a brighter sun"

20134,ARGUMENT.,"""Joyous and light, and fetterless through all                     38"

20136,ARGUMENT.,If then thy spirit stoopeth to recall
20137,ARGUMENT.,"The ray it shed upon the human race,"

20141,ARGUMENT.,"""Never true Poet lived and sung in vain!                          39"
20142,ARGUMENT.,"Lost if his name, and wither'd if his wreath,"
20143,ARGUMENT.,The thoughts he woke--an element remain
20144,ARGUMENT.,Fused in our light and blended with our breath;
20145,ARGUMENT.,"All life more noble, and all earth more fair."
20146,ARGUMENT.,"Because that soul refined man's common air!""[2]"
20147,ARGUMENT.,
20148,ARGUMENT.,"Then rose the Bard, and smilingly unslung                         40"
20149,ARGUMENT.,"His harp of ivory sheen, from shoulders broad,"
20150,ARGUMENT.,"Kissing the hand that doom'd his life, he sprung"
20151,ARGUMENT.,"Light from the shatter'd wall,--and swiftly strode"
20152,ARGUMENT.,"Where, herdlike huddled in the central space,"
20153,ARGUMENT.,"Droop'd, in dull pause, the cowering populace."
20154,ARGUMENT.,
20155,ARGUMENT.,"There, in the midst he stood! The heavens were pale               41"
20156,ARGUMENT.,"With the first stars, unseen amidst the glare"
20157,ARGUMENT.,Cast from large pine-brands on the sullen mail
20158,ARGUMENT.,Of listless legions and the streaming hair
20159,ARGUMENT.,"Of women, wailing for the absent dead,"
20160,ARGUMENT.,Or bow'd o'er infant lips that moan'd for bread.
20161,ARGUMENT.,
20162,ARGUMENT.,From out the illumed cathedral hollowly                           42
20163,ARGUMENT.,"Swell'd, like a dirge, the hymn; and through the throng"
20164,ARGUMENT.,"Whose looks had lost all commerce with the sky,"
20165,ARGUMENT.,"With lifted rood the slow monks swept along,"
20166,ARGUMENT.,And vanish'd hopeless; From those wrecks of man
20167,ARGUMENT.,Fled ev'n Religion: Then the BARD began.
20168,ARGUMENT.,
20169,ARGUMENT.,"Slow, pitying, soft it glides, the liquid lay,                    43"
20170,ARGUMENT.,Sad with the burthen of the Singer's soul
20171,ARGUMENT.,Into the heart it coil'd its lulling way;
20172,ARGUMENT.,Wave upon wave the golden river stole:
20173,ARGUMENT.,"Hush'd to his feet forgetful Famine crept,"
20174,ARGUMENT.,"And Woe, reviving, veil'd the eyes that wept."
20175,ARGUMENT.,
20176,ARGUMENT.,"Then stern, and harsh, clash'd the ascending strain,              44"
20177,ARGUMENT.,Telling of ills more dismal yet in store;
20178,ARGUMENT.,"Rough with the iron of the grinding chain,"
20179,ARGUMENT.,Dire with the curse of slavery evermore;
20180,ARGUMENT.,"Wild shrieks from lips belov'd pale warriors hear,"
20181,ARGUMENT.,Her child's last death-groan rends the mother's ear;
20182,ARGUMENT.,
20183,ARGUMENT.,Then trembling hands instinctive griped the swords;               45
20184,ARGUMENT.,And men unquiet sought each other's eyes;
20185,ARGUMENT.,"Loud into pomp sonorous swell the chords,"
20186,ARGUMENT.,Like linkèd legions march the melodies;
20187,ARGUMENT.,"Till the full rapture swept the Bard along,"
20188,ARGUMENT.,And o'er the listeners rush'd the storm of song!
20189,ARGUMENT.,
20190,ARGUMENT.,And the Dead spoke! from cairns and kingly graves                 46
20191,ARGUMENT.,The Heroes call'd;--and Saints from earliest shrines;
20192,ARGUMENT.,And the Land spoke!--Mellifluous river-waves;
20193,ARGUMENT.,Dim forests awful with the roar of pines;
20194,ARGUMENT.,Mysterious caves from legion-haunted deeps;
20195,ARGUMENT.,And torrents flashing from untrodden steeps;--
20196,ARGUMENT.,
20197,ARGUMENT.,THE LAND OF FREEDOM call'd upon the Free!                         47
20198,ARGUMENT.,All Nature spoke; the clarions of the wind;
20199,ARGUMENT.,The organ swell of the majestic sea;
20200,ARGUMENT.,The choral stars! the Universal Mind
20201,ARGUMENT.,"Spoke, like the voice from which the world began,"
20202,ARGUMENT.,"""No chain for Nature and the Soul of Man!"""
20203,ARGUMENT.,
20204,ARGUMENT.,"Then loud through all, as if mankind's reply,                     48"
20205,ARGUMENT.,Burst from the Bard the Cymrian battle hymn!
20206,ARGUMENT.,"That song which swell'd the anthems of the sky,"
20207,ARGUMENT.,The Alleluia of the Seraphim;
20208,ARGUMENT.,"When Saints led on the Children of the Lord,"
20209,ARGUMENT.,And smote the Heathen with the Angel's sword.[3]
20210,ARGUMENT.,
20211,ARGUMENT.,"As leaps the warfire on the beacon hills,                         49"
20212,ARGUMENT.,Leapt in each heart the lofty flame divine;
20213,ARGUMENT.,"As into sunlight flash the molten rills,"
20214,ARGUMENT.,"Flash'd the glad claymores,[4] lightening line on line;"
20215,ARGUMENT.,"From cloud to cloud as thunder speeds along,"
20216,ARGUMENT.,From rank to rank rush'd forth the choral song.--

20218,ARGUMENT.,"Woman and child--all caught the fire of men,                      50"
20219,ARGUMENT.,"To its own heaven that Alleluia rang,"
20220,ARGUMENT.,Life to the spectres had return'd again;
20221,ARGUMENT.,And from the grave an armèd Nation sprang!
20222,ARGUMENT.,"Then spoke the Bard,--each crest its plumage bow'd,"
20223,ARGUMENT.,As the large voice went lengthening through the crowd
20224,ARGUMENT.,
20225,ARGUMENT.,"""Hark to the measur'd march!--The Saxons come!                    51"
20226,ARGUMENT.,The sound earth quails beneath the hollow tread;
20227,ARGUMENT.,Your fathers rush'd upon the swords of Rome
20228,ARGUMENT.,"And climb'd her war-ships, when the Cæsar fled!"
20229,ARGUMENT.,The Saxons come! why wait within the wall?
20230,ARGUMENT.,They scale the mountain--let its torrents fall!
20231,ARGUMENT.,
20232,ARGUMENT.,"""Mark, ye have swords, and shields, and armour, YE!               52"
20233,ARGUMENT.,"No mail defends the Cymrian Child of Song,[5]"
20234,ARGUMENT.,But where the warrior--there the Bard shall be!
20235,ARGUMENT.,All fields of glory to the Bard belong!
20236,ARGUMENT.,His realm extends wherever godlike strife
20237,ARGUMENT.,"Spurns the base death, and wins immortal life."
20238,ARGUMENT.,
20239,ARGUMENT.,"""Unarm'd he goes--his guard the shields of all,                   53"

20245,ARGUMENT.,
20246,ARGUMENT.,"He said, and where the chieftains wrangling sate,                 54"
20247,ARGUMENT.,"Led the grand army marshall'd by his song,"
20248,ARGUMENT.,"Into the hall--and on the wild debate,"
20249,ARGUMENT.,"King of all kings, A PEOPLE, pour'd along;"

20251,ARGUMENT.,"Smote faction down, ""Arms, arms, and Liberty!""--"
20252,ARGUMENT.,
20253,ARGUMENT.,Meanwhile roll'd on the Saxon's long array;                       55
20254,ARGUMENT.,On to the wall the surge of slaughter roll'd;
20255,ARGUMENT.,Slow up the mount--slow heaved its labouring way;

20266,ARGUMENT.,
20267,ARGUMENT.,"Rings Owaine's shout;--rings Geraint's thunder-cry,               57"
20268,ARGUMENT.,The Saxon's death-knell in a hundred wars;
20269,ARGUMENT.,And Cador's laugh of triumph;--through the sky
20270,ARGUMENT.,"Rush tossing banderolls swift as shooting stars,"
20271,ARGUMENT.,"Trystan's white lion--Lancelot's cross of red,"
20272,ARGUMENT.,And Tudor's[6] standard with the Saxon's head.

20274,ARGUMENT.,"And high o'er all, its scalèd splendour rears                     58"
20275,ARGUMENT.,The vengeful emblem of the Dragon Kings.

20278,ARGUMENT.,"While through the ranks its barbèd knightood clave,"
20279,ARGUMENT.,All Carduel follows with its roaring wave.

20281,ARGUMENT.,"And ever in the van, with robes of white                          59"
20282,ARGUMENT.,"And ivory harp, shone swordless Caradoc!"
20283,ARGUMENT.,"And ever floated in melodious might,"
20284,ARGUMENT.,The clear song buoyant o'er the battle shock;

20293,ARGUMENT.,Down to the vale sunk dun the rent array.

20298,ARGUMENT.,"On Ægypt's chariots, gather'd up the flood;"
20299,ARGUMENT.,"There, in suspended deluge, solid rose,"
20300,ARGUMENT.,And hung expectant o'er the hurrying foes!
20301,ARGUMENT.,
20302,ARGUMENT.,"Right in the centre, rampired round with shields,                 62"
20303,ARGUMENT.,"King Crida stood,--o'er him, its livid mane"

20307,ARGUMENT.,"Distinct, pale soothsayers see the dooming Mars."
20308,ARGUMENT.,
20309,ARGUMENT.,Down dazzling sweeps the Cymrian Chivalry;                        63
20310,ARGUMENT.,Round the bright sweep closes the Saxon wall;
20311,ARGUMENT.,"Snatch'd from the glimmer of the funeral sky,"
20312,ARGUMENT.,Raves the blind murder; and enclasp'd with all
20313,ARGUMENT.,"Its own stern hell, against the iron bar"
20314,ARGUMENT.,Pants the fierce heart of the imprison'd War.
20315,ARGUMENT.,
20316,ARGUMENT.,Only by gleaming banners and the flash                            64
20317,ARGUMENT.,"Of some large sword, the vex'd Obscure once more"
20318,ARGUMENT.,Sparkled to light. In one tumultous clash
20319,ARGUMENT.,Merg'd every sound--as when the maëlstrom's roar
20320,ARGUMENT.,"By dire Lofoden, dulls the seaman's groan,"
20321,ARGUMENT.,And drowns the voice of tempests in its own.
20322,ARGUMENT.,

20330,ARGUMENT.,"But now, at length, cleaving the solid clang,                     66"

20357,ARGUMENT.,
20358,ARGUMENT.,Full on the Saxon's shield the sword descends;                    70
20359,ARGUMENT.,"The strong shield clattering shivers at the stroke,"
20360,ARGUMENT.,And the bright crest with all its plumage bends

20363,ARGUMENT.,"Retowering slow, the crest sublime arose."
20364,ARGUMENT.,
20365,ARGUMENT.,"Grasp'd with both hands, above the Cymrian swung                  71"
20366,ARGUMENT.,"The axe that Odin taught his sons to wield,"

20371,ARGUMENT.,
20372,ARGUMENT.,The bright plume mingles with the charger's mane;                 72

20739,ARGUMENT.,"A lucent Image, crown'd with asphodel,"
20740,ARGUMENT.,"The left hand bore a mirror crystal-bright,"
20741,ARGUMENT.,A wand star-pointed glitter'd in the right.
20742,ARGUMENT.,
20743,ARGUMENT.,"""Dost thou not know me?--me, thy second soul?""                   125"

20855,ARGUMENT.,"And Arthur spoke! O ye, all noble souls,                         141"
20856,ARGUMENT.,Divine how knighthood speaks to maiden fear!
20857,ARGUMENT.,"Yet, is it fear which that young heart controuls"
20858,ARGUMENT.,And leaves its music voiceless on the ear?--
20859,ARGUMENT.,"Ye, who have felt what words can ne'er express,"

22079,ARGUMENT.,The strain'd arms lock'd on his loud-beating heart
22080,ARGUMENT.,"(As if the anguish which the king controll'd,"
22081,ARGUMENT.,"The man could stifle),--Crida toss'd on high;--"
22082,ARGUMENT.,And nature conquer'd in the father's cry!
22083,ARGUMENT.,
22084,ARGUMENT.,Over the kneeling form swept his grey hair;                      105
22085,ARGUMENT.,On the soft upturn'd eyes prest his wild kiss;
22086,ARGUMENT.,"And then recoiling, with a livid stare,"
22087,ARGUMENT.,"He faced the priests, and mutter'd, ""Dotage this!"
22088,ARGUMENT.,"Crida is old,--come--come;"" and from the ring"
22089,ARGUMENT.,"Beckon'd their chief, and went forth tottering."
22090,ARGUMENT.,
22091,ARGUMENT.,"Out of the fane, up where the stair of pine                      106"
22092,ARGUMENT.,"Wound to the summit of the camp's rough tower,"
22093,ARGUMENT.,King Crida pass'd. On moving armour shine
22094,ARGUMENT.,The healthful beams of the fresh morning hour;
22095,ARGUMENT.,"He hears the barb's shrill neigh,--the clarion's swell,"
22096,ARGUMENT.,And half his armies march to Carduel.
22097,ARGUMENT.,
22098,ARGUMENT.,"Far in the van, like Odin's fatal bird                           107"
22099,ARGUMENT.,"Wing'd for its feast, sails Harold's raven plume."
22100,ARGUMENT.,"Now from the city's heart a shout is heard,"
22101,ARGUMENT.,"Wall, bastion, tower, their steel-clad life resume;"
22102,ARGUMENT.,Far shout! faint forms! yet seem they loud and clear
22103,ARGUMENT.,To that strain'd eyeball and that feverish ear.
22104,ARGUMENT.,
22105,ARGUMENT.,"But not on hosts that march by Harold's side,                    108"
22106,ARGUMENT.,"Gazed the stern priest, who stood with Crida there;"
22107,ARGUMENT.,"On sullen gloomy groups--discatter'd wide,"
22108,ARGUMENT.,"Grudging the conflict they refused to share,"
22109,ARGUMENT.,Or seated round rude tents and pilèd spears;
22110,ARGUMENT.,Circling the mutter of rebellious fears;
22111,ARGUMENT.,
22112,ARGUMENT.,"Or, near the temple fort, with folded arms                       109"
22113,ARGUMENT.,"On their broad breasts, waiting the deed of blood;"
22114,ARGUMENT.,On these he gazed--to gloat on the alarms
22115,ARGUMENT.,That made _him_ monarch of that multitude!
22116,ARGUMENT.,Not one man there had pity in his eye.
22117,ARGUMENT.,"And the priest smiled,--then turn'd to watch the sky."
22118,ARGUMENT.,
22119,ARGUMENT.,"And the sky deepen'd, and the time rush'd on.                    110"
22120,ARGUMENT.,And Crida sees the ladders on the wall;
22121,ARGUMENT.,And dust-clouds gather round his gonfanon;
22122,ARGUMENT.,And through the dust-clouds glittering rise and fall
22123,ARGUMENT.,"The meteor lights of helms, and shields, and glaives;"
22124,ARGUMENT.,Up o'er the rampires mount the labouring waves;
22125,ARGUMENT.,
22126,ARGUMENT.,And joyous rings the Saxon's battle shout;                       111
22127,ARGUMENT.,And Cymri's angel cry wails like despair;
22128,ARGUMENT.,"And from the Dragon Keep a light shines out,"
22129,ARGUMENT.,"Calm as a single star in tortured air,"
22130,ARGUMENT.,"To whose high peace, aloof from storms, in vain"
22131,ARGUMENT.,Looks a lost navy from the violent main.
22132,ARGUMENT.,
22133,ARGUMENT.,Now on the nearest wall the Pale Horse stands;                   112
22134,ARGUMENT.,Now from the wall the Pale Horse lightens down;
22135,ARGUMENT.,"And flash and vanish, file on file, the bands"
22136,ARGUMENT.,Into the rent heart of the howling town;
22137,ARGUMENT.,"And the Priest paling frown'd upon the sun,--"
22138,ARGUMENT.,Though the sky deepen'd and the time rush'd on.
22139,ARGUMENT.,
22140,ARGUMENT.,"When from the camp around the fane, there rose                   113"
22141,ARGUMENT.,"Ineffable cries of wonder, wrath, and fear;"
22142,ARGUMENT.,"With some strange light that scares the sunshine, glows"
22143,ARGUMENT.,O'er Sabra's waves the crimson'd atmosphere;
22144,ARGUMENT.,"And dun from out the widening, widening glare,"
22145,ARGUMENT.,"Like Hela's serpents, smoke-reeks wind through air."
22146,ARGUMENT.,
22147,ARGUMENT.,"Forth look'd the king, appall'd! and where his masts             114"
22148,ARGUMENT.,"Soar'd from the verge of the far forest-land,"
22149,ARGUMENT.,"He hears the crackling, as when vernal blasts"
22150,ARGUMENT.,"Shiver Groninga's pines--""Lo, the same hand,"""
22151,ARGUMENT.,"Cried the fierce priest, ""which sway'd the soothsayer's rod,"
22152,ARGUMENT.,"Writes now the last runes of thine angry god!"""
22153,ARGUMENT.,
22154,ARGUMENT.,"And here and there, and wirbelling to and fro,                   115"
22155,ARGUMENT.,"Confused, distraught, pale thousands spread the plain;"
22156,ARGUMENT.,"Some snatch their arms in haste, and yelling go"
22157,ARGUMENT.,Where the fleets burn; some creep around the fane
22158,ARGUMENT.,Like herds for shelter; prone on earth lie some
22159,ARGUMENT.,"Shrieking, ""The Twilight of the Gods hath come!"""
22160,ARGUMENT.,
22161,ARGUMENT.,"And the great glare hath redden'd o'er the town,                 116"
22162,ARGUMENT.,And seems the strife it gildeth to appall;
22163,ARGUMENT.,"Flock back dim straggling Saxons, gazing down"
22164,ARGUMENT.,"The lurid valleys from the jagged wall,"
22165,ARGUMENT.,"Still as on Cuthite towers Chaldean seers,"
22166,ARGUMENT.,When some red portent flamed into the spheres.
22167,ARGUMENT.,
22168,ARGUMENT.,"And now from brake and copse--from combe and dell,               117"
22169,ARGUMENT.,Gleams break;--steel flashes;--helms on helms arise;
22170,ARGUMENT.,"Faint heard at first,--now near, now thunderous,--swell"
22171,ARGUMENT.,The Cymrian mingled with the Baltic cries;
22172,ARGUMENT.,"And, loud alike in each, exulting came"
22173,ARGUMENT.,War's noblest music--a Deliverer's name.
22174,ARGUMENT.,
22175,ARGUMENT.,"""Arthur!--for Arthur!--Arthur is at hand!                        118"
22176,ARGUMENT.,"Woe, Saxons, woe!"" Then from the rampart height"
22177,ARGUMENT.,Vanish'd each watcher; while the rescue-band
22178,ARGUMENT.,Sweep the clear slopes; and not a foe in sight!
22179,ARGUMENT.,And now the beacon on the Dragon Keep:
22180,ARGUMENT.,Springs from pale lustre into hues blood-deep:
22181,ARGUMENT.,
22182,ARGUMENT.,And on that tower stood forth a lonely man;                      119
22183,ARGUMENT.,Full on his form the beacon glory fell;
22184,ARGUMENT.,And joy revived each sinking Cymrian;
22185,ARGUMENT.,"There, the still Prophet watch'd o'er Carduel!"
22186,ARGUMENT.,"Back o'er the walls, and back through gate and breach,"
22187,ARGUMENT.,"Now ebbs the war, like billows from the beach."
22188,ARGUMENT.,
22189,ARGUMENT.,"Along the battlements swift crests arise,                        120"
22190,ARGUMENT.,"Swift follow'd by avenging, smiting brands,"
22191,ARGUMENT.,And fear and flight are in the Saxon cries!
22192,ARGUMENT.,The portals vomit bands on hurtling bands;
22193,ARGUMENT.,"And lo, wide streaming o'er the helms,--again"
22194,ARGUMENT.,The Pale Horse flings on angry winds its mane!
22195,ARGUMENT.,
22196,ARGUMENT.,"And facing still the foe, but backward borne                     121"
22197,ARGUMENT.,"By his own men, towers high one kingliest chief;"
22198,ARGUMENT.,"Deep through the distance roll his shout of scorn,"
22199,ARGUMENT.,And the grand anguish of a hero's grief.
22200,ARGUMENT.,"Bounded the Priest!--""The Gods are heard at last!--"
22201,ARGUMENT.,Proud Harold flieth;--and the noon is past!
22202,ARGUMENT.,
22203,ARGUMENT.,"Come, Crida, come."" Up as from heavy sleep                       122"
22204,ARGUMENT.,The grey-hair'd giant raised his awful head;
22205,ARGUMENT.,"As, after calmest waters, the swift leap"
22206,ARGUMENT.,"Of the strong torrent rushes to its bed,--"
22207,ARGUMENT.,"So the new passion seized and changed the form,"
22208,ARGUMENT.,As if the rest had braced it for the storm.
22209,ARGUMENT.,
22210,ARGUMENT.,No grief was in the iron of that brow;                           123
22211,ARGUMENT.,Age cramp'd no sinew in that mighty arm;
22212,ARGUMENT.,"""Go,"" he said sternly, ""where it fits thee, thou:"
22213,ARGUMENT.,Thy post with Odin--mine with Managarm![6]

22215,ARGUMENT.,"My shrine yon Standard, and my Children--_there_!"""
22216,ARGUMENT.,
22217,ARGUMENT.,So from the height he swept--as doth a cloud                     124
22218,ARGUMENT.,That brings a tempest when it sinks below;
22219,ARGUMENT.,Swift strides a chief amidst the jarring crowd;
22220,ARGUMENT.,Swift in stern ranks the rent disorders grow;
22221,ARGUMENT.,"Swift, as in sails becalm'd swells forth the wind,"
22222,ARGUMENT.,The wide mass quickens with the one strong mind.
22223,ARGUMENT.,
22224,ARGUMENT.,"Meanwhile the victim, to the Demon vow'd,                        125"
22225,ARGUMENT.,"Knelt; every thought wing'd for the Angel goal,"
22226,ARGUMENT.,And ev'n the terror which the form had bow'd
22227,ARGUMENT.,Search'd but new sweetness where it shook the soul.
22228,ARGUMENT.,"Self was forgot, and to the Eternal Ear"
22229,ARGUMENT.,Prayer but for others spoke the human fear.
22230,ARGUMENT.,
22231,ARGUMENT.,And when at moments from that rapt communion                     126
22232,ARGUMENT.,"With the Invisible Holy, those young arms"
22233,ARGUMENT.,"Clasp'd round her neck, to childhood's happy union"
22234,ARGUMENT.,In the old days recall'd her; such sweet charms
22235,ARGUMENT.,"Did Comfort weave, that in the sister's breast"
22236,ARGUMENT.,Grief like an infant sobb'd itself to rest.
22237,ARGUMENT.,
22238,ARGUMENT.,Up leapt the solemn priests from dull repose:                    127
22239,ARGUMENT.,The fires were fann'd as with a sudden wind;
22240,ARGUMENT.,"While shrieking loud, ""Hark, hark, the conquering foes!"
22241,ARGUMENT.,"Haste, haste, the victim to the altar bind!"""
22242,ARGUMENT.,Rush'd to the shrine the haggard Slaughter-Chief.--
22243,ARGUMENT.,As the strong gusts that whirl the fallen leaf
22244,ARGUMENT.,
22245,ARGUMENT.,"I' the month when wolves descend, the barbarous hands            128"
22246,ARGUMENT.,"Plunge on the prey of their delirious wrath,"
22247,ARGUMENT.,"Wrench'd from Genevra's clasp;--Lo, where she stands,"
22248,ARGUMENT.,"On earth no anchor,--is she less like Faith?"
22249,ARGUMENT.,"The same smile firmly sad, the same calm eye,"
22250,ARGUMENT.,The same meek strength;--strength to forgive and die!
22251,ARGUMENT.,
22252,ARGUMENT.,"""Hear us, O Odin, in this last despair!                          129"
22253,ARGUMENT.,"Hear us, and save!"" the Pontiff call'd aloud;"
22254,ARGUMENT.,"""By the Child's blood we shed, thy children spare!"""
22255,ARGUMENT.,And the knife glitter'd o'er the breast that bow'd.
22256,ARGUMENT.,Dropp'd blade;--fell priest!--blood chokes a gurgling groan;
22257,ARGUMENT.,"Blood,--blood _not Christian_, dyes the altar-stone!"
22258,ARGUMENT.,
22259,ARGUMENT.,Deep in the DOOMER'S breast it sank--the dart;                   130
22260,ARGUMENT.,As if from Fate it came invisibly;
22261,ARGUMENT.,Where is the hand?--from what dark hush shall start
22262,ARGUMENT.,"Foeman or fiend?--no shape appalls the eye,"
22263,ARGUMENT.,No sound the ear!--ice-lock'd each coward breath;
22264,ARGUMENT.,"The Power the Deathsman call'd, hath heard him--Death!"
22265,ARGUMENT.,
22266,ARGUMENT.,"""While yet the stupor stuns the circle there,                    131"
22267,ARGUMENT.,Fierce shrieks--loud feet--come rushing through the doors:
22268,ARGUMENT.,"Women with outstretch'd arms and tossing hair,"
22269,ARGUMENT.,"And flying warriors, shake the solemn floors;"
22270,ARGUMENT.,Thick as the birds storm-driven on the decks
22271,ARGUMENT.,Of some lone ship--the last an ocean wrecks.
22272,ARGUMENT.,
22273,ARGUMENT.,"And where on tumult, tumult whirl'd and roar'd,                  132"
22274,ARGUMENT.,"Shrill'd cries, ""The fires around us and behind,"
22275,ARGUMENT.,"And the last Fire-God and the Flaming-Sword!""[7]"
22276,ARGUMENT.,"And from without, like that destroying wind"
22277,ARGUMENT.,"In which the world shall perish, grides and sweeps"
22278,ARGUMENT.,VICTORY--swift-cleaving through the battle deeps!--
22279,ARGUMENT.,
22280,ARGUMENT.,"VICTORY, by shouts of terrible rapture known,                    133"
22281,ARGUMENT.,Through crashing ranks it drives in iron rain;
22282,ARGUMENT.,Borne on the wings of fire it blazes on;
22283,ARGUMENT.,It halts its storm before the fortress fane;
22284,ARGUMENT.,"And through the doors, and through the chinks of pine,"
22285,ARGUMENT.,Flames its red breath upon the paling shrine.
22286,ARGUMENT.,
22287,ARGUMENT.,Roused to their demon courage by the dread                       134

22294,ARGUMENT.,The wolf's hide bristled on the shaggy breast                    135
22295,ARGUMENT.,"Over the brows, the forest buffalo"
22296,ARGUMENT.,"With horn impending arm'd the grisly crest,"
22297,ARGUMENT.,From which the swart eye sent its savage glow:
22298,ARGUMENT.,"Long shall the Saxon dreams that shape recall,"
22299,ARGUMENT.,And ghastly legends teem with tales of FAUL![8]
22300,ARGUMENT.,
22301,ARGUMENT.,"Needs here to tell, that when, at Merlin's hest,                 136"

22305,ARGUMENT.,And the grim tidings of the rite to come
22306,ARGUMENT.,Flew lip to lip through that awed Heathendom.
22307,ARGUMENT.,
22308,ARGUMENT.,"Foretaught by Merlin of her mission there,                       137"
22309,ARGUMENT.,Scarce to her father's heart Genevra sprung
22310,ARGUMENT.,Than (while most soften'd) her impassion'd prayer
22311,ARGUMENT.,"Pierced to its human deeps; and, roused and stung"
22312,ARGUMENT.,"By that keen pity, keenest in the brave,--"
22313,ARGUMENT.,"Strength felt why strength is given, and rush'd to save:--"
22314,ARGUMENT.,
22315,ARGUMENT.,"Amidst those quick emotions half forgot,                         138"
22316,ARGUMENT.,Follow'd the tutor'd furtive Aleman;
22317,ARGUMENT.,"On, when the portals crash'd, still heeded not,"
22318,ARGUMENT.,Stole his light step behind the striding Thane.
22319,ARGUMENT.,"From coign to shaft the practised glider crept,"
22320,ARGUMENT.,"A shadow, lost where shadows darkest slept."
22321,ARGUMENT.,
22322,ARGUMENT.,"And safe and screen'd the idol god behind,                       139"
22323,ARGUMENT.,"He who once lurk'd to slay, kept watch to save;--"

22330,ARGUMENT.,"While yet shrunk back the priests--the savage leapt,"
22331,ARGUMENT.,And with quick steel gash'd the strong cords that tied;
22332,ARGUMENT.,When round them both the rallying vengeance swept;
22333,ARGUMENT.,Raised every arm;--O joy!--the enchanted glaive
22334,ARGUMENT.,Shines o'er the threshold! is there time to save?
22335,ARGUMENT.,
22336,ARGUMENT.,A torch whirls hissing through the air--it falls                 141

22343,ARGUMENT.,"Bright as the shape that smote the Assyrian,                     142"
22344,ARGUMENT.,The fulgent splendour from the arms divine
22345,ARGUMENT.,"Paled the hell-fires round God's elected Man,"
22346,ARGUMENT.,And burst like Truth upon the demon-shrine.

22352,ARGUMENT.,"For there the war, in its fast ebbing tide,"
22353,ARGUMENT.,"Flings its last prey--there, Crida takes his stand;"

22357,ARGUMENT.,And as a tiger swept adown a flood                               144
22358,ARGUMENT.,"With meaner beasts, that dyes the howling water"
