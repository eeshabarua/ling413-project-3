79,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.
80,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
81,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
82,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"In a beautiful part of beautiful Somerset, where the ""soft orchard and"
83,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"cottage scenery"" is dimpled between blue hillslopes, where meadows and"
84,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"woods and translucent streams compete with each other in charm,--in the"
85,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"lovely region of the Quantock hills, lies the quiet little market-village"
86,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"of Nether Stowey. About sunrise on a May morning of 1790, a young man"
87,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"awoke in a little wayside cottage there: and, resolutely thrusting back"
88,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"his natural inclination to indolence, rose and dressed, and set himself to"
89,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,the performance of such humble duties as devolve upon a very poor
90,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,householder with a wife and child.
91,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
92,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Samuel Taylor Coleridge was in his twenty-sixth year: pale, stoutish,"
93,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"black-haired: not an immediately attractive man. His face, according to"
94,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"himself, bore evidence of ""great sloth and great, indeed almost idiotic,"
95,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"good nature: ... a mere carcase of a face; fat, flabby, and expressive"
96,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"chiefly of inexpressions,"" with a wide, thick-lipped, always-open mouth,"
97,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"and small feeble nose. Yet it was capable of being roused, on occasion, to"
98,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"something akin to nobility and beauty, and redeemed by the animation of"
99,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"his full, grey eyes. It was a face, in short, to match his general"
100,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"appearance, which he dismissed as that of ""indolence capable of energies,"""
101,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"and Carlyle characterised as ""weakness under possibility of strength."""
102,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
103,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,For this was a man who was consistent in his faults as in his virtues:
104,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""always conscious of power, but also conscious of want of will to use his"
105,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"power."" And it was therefore with re-doubled vigour, this particular"
106,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"morning, that he put on a spurt, and threw unusual force into his chopping"
107,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"of firewood,--his somewhat clumsy attempts to clean up the cottage, with"
108,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"its poor accommodation and few utensils,--and his valiant if ineffectual"
109,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"endeavours to have the fire lighted and the modest meal _en route_, whilst"
110,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"his wife, up the ladder stairs, attended to herself and the baby."
111,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
112,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Between-whiles he cast admiring glances of the most ardent delight at his
113,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"garden of an acre and a half, and its glowing mass of apple-bloom,--and at"
114,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,all the luscious greeneries of the May world without. These glimpses into
115,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""opening Paradise"" went far to compensate him for his determination to"
116,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"keep no servant, but to be maid-of-all-work, and nurse if need be,"
117,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,himself. They ministered to that spirit of contemplation which was the
118,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,ruling spirit of his life: they were the very texture of dreams....
119,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
120,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Soon Sara Coleridge descended and took her share in the domestic
121,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"preparations. She found fault, after a quick vivacious fashion, with her"
122,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,husband's futile efforts and perplexities. She was the typical
123,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"incompatible wife for a poet: not only, socially speaking, his inferior,"
124,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,but naturally incapable of sharing his dreams or sympathising with his
125,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"studies. Yet she was an honest and good-hearted woman; and perhaps, now"
126,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"and then, she felt a certain lack of human warmth in the warmest of human"
127,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,relationships. For there was a tepid quality about Coleridge's affections
128,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,and his expression of them: fire and fervour were utterly unknown to his
129,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"pensive, tender, gentle methods. He had no intensity or passion, either in"
130,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,love or friendship: his feelings were steadfast and of an unblemished
131,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"purity, yet the very fact that they knew neither ebb nor flow, but were"
132,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"always maintained at a calm level, might jar upon the inscrutable mind of"
133,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"a woman. One might almost imagine, as Sara bustled to and fro and scolded"
134,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"her husband with the volubility of a squirrel, that she was anxious to"
135,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"urge him, if but for one moment, out of his invariable _laisser faire_ of"
136,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"amiability.... But no: he remained as placid, as good tempered, as"
137,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,cheerful as ever.
138,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
139,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Presently another member of the household appeared, Coleridge's pupil and"
140,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"paying-guest,--worth a precious £70 a year to the lean exchequer,--one"
141,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Charles Lloyd. He was a young bank-clerk who had poetry on the brain, and"
142,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,found himself ill-attuned to the drudgery of keeping his father's ledgers.
143,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"He was also subject to epileptic fits, which did not conduce either to"
144,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,poetizing or banking with success. What he expected to learn from
145,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Coleridge, it is hard to say: certainly his curriculum included a good"
146,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"many hardships, makeshifts and _contretemps_ to which he had never looked"
147,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"forward. His instructor, however, had not deceived him as to the hybrid"
148,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,nature of his present occupation. Coleridge had deliberately set himself
149,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"down at Nether Stowey to be near his friend Tom Poole, and to support"
150,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"himself by ""a mixture of literature and husbandry."" He proposed to make"
151,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,some £60 per annum by reviewing and magazine work: he had an offer from
152,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Cottle, the Bristol publisher, for as much verse as he chose to write, at"
153,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"terms working out somewhere near fourpence a line,--and for the rest, ""I"
154,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"would rather,"" he declared, ""be an expert self-maintaining gardener than a"
155,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Milton, for I could not unite both. I mean to raise the vegetables for"
156,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"myself and wife, and feed a couple of snouted and grunting cousins from"
157,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"the refuse. My evenings I shall devote to literature.""--""And what,"""
158,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"enquired Charles Lamb after hearing of this desperate undertaking, ""what"
159,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"does your worship know about farming?"" But Coleridge was not to be"
160,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"discouraged. He allowed his natural unfitness for the task--""I am, and"
161,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"ever have been, a great reader, and have read almost everything.... I am"
162,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"_deep_ in all out-of-the-way books, whether of the monkish times or of the"
163,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Puritanical era. I have read and digested most of the historic writers,"
164,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,but I do not _like_ history. Metaphysics and poetry and 'facts of the
165,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"mind' (_i.e._, accounts of all the strange phantasms that ever possessed"
166,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"your philosophy-dreamers, from Thoth, the Egyptian, to Taylor, the English"
167,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"pagan) are my darling studies. In short, I seldom read except to amuse"
168,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"myself, and I am almost always reading. Of useful knowledge,--I am a so-so"
169,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"chemist, and I love chemistry--all else is blank--but I will be (please"
170,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"God) a horticulturist and farmer."""
171,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
172,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,What is to be done against such impregnable obstinacy? Coleridge's friends
173,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"let him ""gang his ain gait"": and when _mauvais quarts d'heure_ threatened"
174,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"to drive him to despair, they came to the rescue with timely cheques:"
175,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"meanwhile, Tom Poole strove hard to educate him in potato culture, and"
176,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Charles Lloyd paid down his twenty-five shillings a week.
177,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
178,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,But to-day Charles Lloyd was looking ill-at-ease and sulky. He threw out
179,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"hints about the general discomfort of things,--vague allusions to other"
180,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,people being made much of and himself contemned. He was in a disagreeable
181,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"mood, and evidently dying to pick a quarrel. Half through breakfast, he"
182,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"took umbrage at some inoffensive jest, and flung himself out of the room."
183,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
184,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""What can ail the lad?"" asked Coleridge, in amazement."
185,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
186,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""I suppose he has another fit coming on,"" observed the practical Sara."
187,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
188,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""I don't like sour looks and bitter words in our peaceful home,"" said the"
189,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"poet, rumpling his heavy black locks with a distracted air."
190,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
191,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""God forbid that he should take it into his head to go away,"" said Sara:"
192,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,and she got up with a very grave face and proceeded to clear the breakfast
193,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,table. Coleridge betook himself to the garden and called over the back
194,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,hedge to the neighbour for whose companionship he had taken this
195,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"inefficient little cottage. Thomas Poole, his friend and benefactor, was a"
196,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"well-to-do tanner, well-educated and a devout student of literature: he"
197,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"discerned the potentialities of great things in Coleridge, and felt"
198,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,honoured by his acquaintanceship. For the poet had something of that
199,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"peculiar fascination for more prosaic men, that magnetic charm of"
200,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"personality, which atones for so many minor defects,--which obviates"
201,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"weakness and ill-balance of mind,--which even endears him who is"
202,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""impossible"" from a worldly standpoint, to those of saner and robuster"
203,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"calibre. Coleridge could never be without a friend, without a listener:"
204,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"and a listener was a desideratum to him. This ""noticeable man with large"
205,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"grey eyes"" undoubtedly attracted to himself all that was best in other"
206,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"people: his culture allured them, his eloquence held them spell-bound, and"
207,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"his voice--that wonderful voice which was to Hazlitt ""as a stream of rich"
208,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"distilled perfumes""--sank into every fibre of their being."
209,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
210,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"So you cannot be surprised that the faithful, kindly Thomas Poole, already"
211,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"busy in his tan-yard, hearing Coleridge calling at the hedge, instantly"
212,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,forsook his proper tasks and hurried to salute his comrade. When he heard
213,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"of Charles Lloyd's tendency towards mutiny, ""Oh,"" says Poole with a great"
214,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"laugh, ""don't let that discompose you. The young man is consumed by a very"
215,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"common malady,--jealousy. And indeed I think he has some cause."""
216,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
217,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""Jealousy!"" repeated Coleridge, rolling his fine eyes wildly. It was a"
218,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"word which had little or no meaning for him. ""Jealousy of whom? about"
219,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"whom?--I do not understand you in the least."""
220,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
221,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""Why, your fine friends the Wordsworths, of course,"" Poole told him. ""Here"
222,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"have you been gadding about with them the whole of this last twelve-month,"
223,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"trapesing the hills night and day and leaving your pupil, forsooth, to"
224,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"sit at home with Madam and Master Baby, a-twiddling his thumbs and"
225,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,scribbling schoolboy verse. You have taken precious little notice of
226,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"him,--and as for your friends, they think him but a poor thing not worth"
227,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"mention. I say he is a lad of spirit to kick up his heels at last."""
228,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
229,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""True, true,--I may have neglected him to some extent,"" murmured Coleridge"
230,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"with a pained air, ""but indeed, my good Poole, if you knew what the"
231,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Wordsworths have been to me! Manna in the desert--water in the
232,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"wilderness--happiness like the alighting of a paradise-bird--"""
233,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
234,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""Quite so, my dear fellow,"" interrupted the unemotional Poole, ""but you"
235,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"are not now in the pulpit. Bring yourself down to earth for a moment, for"
236,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"I have but little time to spare this morning,--and let us see what are the"
237,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"most crying needs of to-day in your garden."""
238,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
239,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,There is enough to do in a May garden to occupy the most diligent: and as
240,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Coleridge raked and hoed and thinned out and weeded his vegetable beds,"
241,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"with blistered hands and a back that longed for a hinge in it, he was"
242,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,inclined to wish that Lloyd had come as an agricultural rather than a
243,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,poetical pupil. From time to time he rested on his tool and assimilated
244,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,with rapt eye the innumerable surrounding touches of simple beauty. He was
245,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"a man who, like Wordsworth, interested himself in every little trifle. The"
246,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,delicate details of sight and sound were very dear to him; they had
247,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"enabled him to ""become one with Nature"" in an almost literal sense, as he"
248,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"observed, with a calm but intense enjoyment, such side-issues as:"
249,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
250,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"The one red leaf, the last of its clan,"
251,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"That dances as often as dance it can,"
252,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Hanging so light and hanging so high,"
253,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,On the topmost twig that looks up at the sky;
254,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
255,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,or--
256,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
257,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"The unripe flax,"
258,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"When through its half-transparent stalks, at eve,"
259,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,The level sunshine glitters with green light;
260,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
261,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,or--
262,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
263,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"The hornéd Moon, with one bright star"
264,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Within the nether tip.
265,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
266,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"And, indeed, Coleridge was aware himself of the extraordinary power which"
267,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"was exercised upon him by external and visible things,--especially by the"
268,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,magic of scenery. He wrote:
269,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
270,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,[Illustration: THE CHASM IN XANADU.
271,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
272,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted"
273,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
274,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,A savage place! as holy and enchanted
275,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
276,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"By woman wailing for her demon-lover!"""
277,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
278,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,(_Kubla Khan_).]
279,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
280,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,I never find myself alone within the embracement of rocks and
281,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"hills ... but my spirit careers, drives and eddies like a leaf"
282,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"in autumn; a wild activity of thoughts, imaginations, feelings"
283,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,and impulses of motion rises up within me.... The further I
284,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,ascend from animated nature ... the greater in me becomes the
285,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,intensity of the feeling of life. Life seems to me then a
286,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"universal spirit, that neither has nor can have an opposite. God"
287,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"is everywhere, and where is there room for death?"
288,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
289,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"And he determinedly developed in his theory of poetry, his sense of the"
290,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,depths that lie below nature's more superficial aspects. He had accorded
291,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"to his sleeping babe, a few short months before, that tenderest of all"
292,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"benedictions, that gift of untarnishable joy:"
293,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
294,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee,"
295,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Whether the summer clothe the general earth
296,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"With greenness, or the redbreast sit and sing"
297,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch
298,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Of mossy apple-tree, while the nigh thatch"
299,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Smokes in the sun-thaw; whether the eave-drops fall
300,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Heard only in the trances of the blast,"
301,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Or if the secret ministry of frost
302,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Shall hang them up in silent icicles,"
303,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Quietly shining to the quiet Moon:
304,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
305,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"and he had conversed at great length and frequency with Wordsworth, on"
306,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"what he termed ""the two cardinal points of poetry--the power of exciting"
307,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,the sympathy of the reader by a faithful adherence to the truth of nature
308,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,and the power of giving the interest of novelty by the modifying colours
309,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"of imagination. The sudden charm which accidents of light and shade, which"
310,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"moonlight or sunset diffused over a known and familiar landscape, appeared"
311,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,to represent the practicability of combining both. These are the poetry of
312,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"nature."" He had no greater pleasure possible than to steep himself in ""the"
313,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,loveliness and the wonders of the world before us: an inexhaustible
314,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"treasure,"" he proclaimed, ""but for which, in consequence of the film of"
315,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"familiarity and selfish solitude, we have eyes, yet see not, ears that"
316,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"hear not and hearts that neither feel nor understand."" And when his"
317,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,imagination craved some wilder and more romantic outlook than the peaceful
318,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"village where,"
319,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
320,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"beside one friend,"
321,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Beneath the impervious covert of one oak,"
322,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"I've raised a lowly shed, and know the names"
323,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Of Husband and of Father,--"
324,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
325,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"that imagination could at will supply its wants. His eyes could ""make"
326,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"pictures when they are shut,"" and could carry him momentarily, as on some"
327,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"magic carpet, to a dreamland beyond the limitations of mortal experience."
328,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,The same exquisite and meticulous perception which enabled Coleridge to
329,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"realize and remember the double sound of rain, the ""quiet sounds from"
330,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"hidden rills,"" among the heather, the slanting shower of blossoms on the"
331,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""faint gale of departing May,""--revealed to him how"
332,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
333,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
334,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,A stately pleasure-dome decree:
335,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran"
336,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Through caverns measureless to man
337,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Down to a sunless sea.
338,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,So twice five miles of fertile ground
339,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,With walls and towers were girdled round:
340,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills
341,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
342,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"And here were forests ancient as the hills,"
343,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
344,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
345,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!

352,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
353,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,"
354,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Then reached the caverns measureless to man,"
355,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
356,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
357,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
358,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Ancestral voices prophesying war!
359,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
360,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Such, in fact, was the dual capacity of Coleridge's mind,--such its"

363,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
364,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Low was our pretty Cot; our tallest Rose
365,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Peeped at the chamber-window. We could hear
366,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"At silent noon, and eve, and early morn,"
367,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,The Sea's faint murmur. In the open air
368,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Our Myrtles blossom'd; and across the Porch
369,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Thick Jasmins twin'd: the little landscape round,"
370,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Was green and woody, and refresh'd the eye."
371,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,It was a spot which you might aptly call
372,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,The Valley of Seclusion!

376,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
377,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"... Now there came both mist and snow,"
378,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And it grew wondrous cold:
379,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"And ice, mast-high, came floating by,"
380,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,As green as emerald.
381,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
382,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And through the drifts the snowy clifts
383,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Did send a dismal sheen:
384,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken--
385,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,The ice was all between.
386,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
387,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"The ice was here, the ice was there,"
388,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,The ice was all around:
389,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,"
390,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Like noises in a swound!
391,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
392,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"At length did cross an Albatross,--"
393,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Through the fog it came;
394,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"As if it had been a Christian soul,"
395,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,We hailed it in God's name.
396,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
397,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"It ate the food it ne'er had eat,"
398,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And round and round it flew.
399,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,The ice did split with a thunder-fit;
400,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,The helmsman steered us through!
401,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
402,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"But now, while the sun poured down hotter and still hotter rays upon the"
403,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"unaccustomed back of Coleridge, he heard the hearty voice of Tom Poole,"
404,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,summoning him to the bark-built arbour under the big elm-trees. A jug of
405,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,egg-flip and a delightful chat were awaiting him: the bees were humming
406,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"round in the ""lime-tree bower"" of the garden: and the deep, vibrating"
407,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"voice of the poet, roused to unwonted exhilaration, was presently moved to"
408,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"declaim one of his own magnificent imitations from Schiller, _The Visit of"

442,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"for doing, Poole,--for digging and forking and stooping,--it was meant for"
443,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"dreaming, for endless reveries of eternal beauty."""
444,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
445,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""That is not likely ever to be my lot,"" said the matter-of-fact Poole,"
446,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""Too much to see after."""
447,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
448,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""It might be mine, perhaps, did I choose...."" observed Coleridge, with the"
449,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"abstracted air of one talking in his sleep, ""Have I ever told you, Poole,"
450,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"of the offer I have had from the Wedgwood brothers?"""
451,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
452,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""The china-man's sons?"" Poole queried."
453,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
454,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""The same,"" said Coleridge. ""They have offered me an annuity for life, of"
455,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"£140 a year, to prevent my being obliged to abandon poetry and philosophy,"
456,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"as I must do if I take up preaching professionally."""
457,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
458,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""It is a vastly fine offer!"" exclaimed the astonished Poole."
459,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
460,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""On the other hand,"" continued his friend, ""the Unitarian Chapel people at"
461,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Shrewsbury will pay me £120 a year to become their preacher: and that
462,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"means that I give up literary work. I cannot combine both. Hitherto, as"
463,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"you know, I have refused to accept any remuneration for my sermons: to be"
464,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"a hireling is against my principles: when I go to Taunton or Bridgewater,"
465,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"I do it freely. But here are these two proposals, and I know not which to"
466,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"accept. I freely confess to you, Poole, what you probably know"
467,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"already,--that I am very seriously worried over money matters, and that I"
468,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"perceive I can never support my family by manual labour. My play _Osorio_,"
469,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"which Sheridan requested me to write for Drury Lane, has been rejected: I"
470,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"have no talent, I fear, for the drama. I am too tired after work in an"
471,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,evening to do any reviewing or writing. And now I am threatened by the
472,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,prospect of Lloyd leaving us--that means the loss of our main income. A
473,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"sort of calm hopelessness diffuses itself over my heart. Indeed, every"
474,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,mode of life which promised me bread and cheese has been torn away from
475,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"me: but God remains."""
476,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
477,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,This long speech was not without effect upon the kind-hearted Poole.
478,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Pocketing certain twinges of what in Charles Lloyd he had defined as
479,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"jealousy, he asked, ""And what does your friend Mr. Wordsworth say? You are"
480,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"so constantly in his company, that I should suppose he would be a very"
481,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"fit judge of the best course for you to take."""
482,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
483,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""Oh, Wordsworth,--well, need you ask? Of course he urges me to accept the"
484,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Wedgwoods' generosity, and devote myself to poetical work alone. But my"
485,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"mind misgives me, lest in doing that I should be turning my back upon the"
486,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,service of God. Am I not more efficacious for good as a preacher than as a
487,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"versifier?"""
488,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
489,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""We-ell, I don't know,"" muttered Poole, ""We can all read your poems, you"
490,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"see, but we can't all follow you about the west-country to listen to"
491,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"you,--we can't track you to chapels at Taunton, or Bridgewater, or"
492,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Shrewsbury, however eloquent you may be. Not but what,"" he added with a"
493,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"sly twinkle, ""you do a pretty fairish deal of preaching in private."""
494,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
495,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""That's what Lamb said,"" remarked Coleridge, ""I asked him if he had ever"
496,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"heard me preach, and he said, 'M-my d-dear f-fellow, I n-n-never heard you"
497,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"do anything else!' A trifle flippant at times, is our good Lamb.... But"
498,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"who's this?""--and he sprang from his seat with unwonted energy."
499,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
500,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""Oh, it's your friends from Alfoxden,"" said Poole: and, with the resigned"
501,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"expression of one relegated to a back seat, he picked up the empty"
502,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"flip-jug and glasses, and returned to his own domain."
503,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
504,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Two people were coming down Coleridge's garden,--a ""gaunt and"

506,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"and a slender, pleasing, dark-haired woman in her early twenties. They"
507,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,were William and Dorothy Wordsworth: names dearer than any to the
508,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,contemplative heart of Coleridge. For nearly a year they had been tenants
509,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"of Alfoxden Manor-house, about a mile away among the hills: for nearly a"
510,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"year they had been his constant companions, his solace, his inspiration."
511,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"To their example and society he owed, as he allowed, the awakening and"
512,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"consummation of his genius: for although the ""magic and melody"" of his"

527,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""Three people but one soul,"" Coleridge had called this ideally-united trio"
528,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"of himself and his friends; and as ""three people with one soul,"" they"

534,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"and brush, and a hurried goodbye to Sara, and the poet had forsaken a"
535,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,distasteful employment for a singularly congenial one. Over the hills and

569,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"haste! He had undertaken a translation of Wieland's _Oberon_, which was"

688,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And is that Woman all her crew?
689,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Is that a Death? and are there two?
690,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Is Death that woman's mate?
691,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
692,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"_Her_ lips were red, _her_ looks were free,"
693,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Her locks were yellow as gold:
694,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Her skin was as white as leprosy,"
695,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"The Nightmare Life-in-Death was she,"
696,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Who thicks man's blood with cold.
697,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
698,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"The naked hulk alongside came,"
699,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And the twain were casting dice;
700,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,'The game is done! I've won! I've won!'
701,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Quoth she, and whistles thrice."
702,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
703,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:
704,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,At one stride comes the dark;
705,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea,"
706,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Off shot the spectre-bark.
707,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
708,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"We listened, and looked sideways up!"
709,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Fear at my heart, as at a cup,"
710,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,My life-blood seemed to sip!
711,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"The stars were dim, and thick the night,"
712,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;
713,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
714,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,From the sails the dew did drip--
715,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Till clomb above the eastern bar
716,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"The hornéd Moon, with one bright star"
717,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Within the nether tip.
718,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
719,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Or who could have supposed that Wordsworth's subsequent suggestion for the
720,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"plot of the poem, ""Suppose you represent the Mariner as having killed an"
721,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Albatross on entering the South Sea, and that the tutelary spirits of"
722,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"these regions take upon themselves to avenge the crime,"" should develop"
723,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"into that magnificent defence of the animal right to live, which, in"
724,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Coleridge's opinion, obtruded a moral sentiment too openly in a work of"
725,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"such pure imagination? The curse of remorse, throughout the whole story,"
726,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,hangs as heavy on the seaman's soul as does the dead weight of the
727,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Albatross around his neck: until that mystical moment when he blesses the
728,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"beauty of the ""happy living things"" in the water, ""God's creatures of the"
729,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"great calm,"""
730,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
731,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"The moving Moon went up the sky,"
732,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And no where did abide:
733,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Softly she was going up,"
734,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And a star or two beside.
735,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
736,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Her beams bemocked the sultry main,"
737,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Like April hoar-frost spread;
738,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"But where the ship's huge shadow lay,"
739,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,The charmed water burnt alway
740,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,A still and awful red.
741,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
742,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Beyond the shadow of the ship,"
743,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,I watched the water-snakes:
744,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"They moved in tracks of shining white,"
745,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"And when they reared, the elfish light"
746,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Fell off in hoary flakes.
747,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
748,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Within the shadow of the ship
749,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,I watched their rich attire:
750,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,"
751,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,They coiled and swam; and every track
752,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Was a flash of golden fire.
753,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
754,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,O happy living things! no tongue
755,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Their beauty might declare:
756,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"A spring of love gushed from my heart,"
757,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And I blessed them unaware:
758,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Sure my kind saint took pity on me,"
759,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And I blessed them unaware.
760,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
761,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,The self-same moment I could pray;
762,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And from my neck so free
763,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"The Albatross fell off, and sank"
764,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Like lead into the sea.

774,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
775,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,... Side by side the three friends wandered over the May-sweet
776,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"hillsides,--dipping into wooded combes, musical with the sound of"
777,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"streams,--climbing the heathery slopes, resting here and there upon some"
778,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"glorious crest to drink in all the joy and colour of the landscape, and to"
779,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"reflect, in Coleridge's own words, how--"
780,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
781,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Flowers are lovely; Love is flower-like;
782,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Friendship is a sheltering tree.
783,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
784,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Each of them young,--each of them passionate lovers of Nature,--each"
785,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"brimming with hopes, and equipped with commanding intellect,--they formed"
786,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"the three-fold chord, with its tonic, dominant and mediant, of which is"
787,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,born all music....
788,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
789,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,It was nearly eight o'clock when Coleridge parted from the Wordsworths at
790,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,the gate of Alfoxden. They were happily tired after some nine hours'
791,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"rambling, and a serene joy lit up their faces, as of those who have passed"
792,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"through some enchanting experience,--who have touched at some oasis of"
793,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"sheer delight. Coleridge tried to frame his thoughts into words, as he"
794,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"strode homeward with his loose shambling gait, continually shifting from"
795,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"one side of the path to the other after his notorious ""corkscrew"" habit."
796,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"The notes of the nightingale, poignantly sweet, echoed to him out of the"
797,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"woods,--and he would gladly have lingered to listen; but, instead, he"
798,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,thought--
799,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
800,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Farewell, O Warbler! till to-morrow eve,"
801,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"And you, my friends! farewell, a short farewell!"
802,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"We have been loitering long and pleasantly,"
803,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And now for our dear homes.--That strain again!
804,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Full fain it would delay me! My dear babe,"
805,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Who, capable of no articulate sound,"
806,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Mars all things with his imitative lisp,"
807,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"How he would place his hand beside his ear,"
808,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"His little hand, the small forefinger up,"
809,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And bid us listen! And I deem it wise
810,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,To make him Nature's play-mate. He knows well
811,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"The evening star; and once, when he awoke"
812,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,In most distressful mood (some inward pain
813,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Had made up that strange thing, an infant's dream)"
814,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"I hurried with him to our orchard-plot,"
815,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"And he beheld the Moon, and, hushed at once,"
816,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Suspends his sobs, and laughs most silently,"
817,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"While his fair eyes, that swam with un-dropped tears,"
818,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Did glitter in the yellow moonbeam! Well!--
819,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,It is a father's tale. But if that Heaven
820,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Should give me life, his childhood shall grow up"
821,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Familiar with these songs, that with the night"
822,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"He may associate joy! Once more farewell,"
823,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Sweet Nightingale! Once more, my friends! farewell."
824,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
825,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Sara met him in the road with a despondent air. ""Lloyd has gone,"" said"
826,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,she.
827,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
828,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""Gone! what, actually _gone_! Do you mean to say he has left us?"""
829,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"exclaimed Coleridge, horrorstruck."
830,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
831,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""He packed up his things and took leave of me,"" she replied; ""it seems he"
832,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"hired a conveyance from Bristol to fetch him home."""
833,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
834,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""Good Heavens!"" cried her husband: and all the tranquil joy died out of"
835,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"his face; nothing but weariness, flabbiness and dejection remained. ""Did"
836,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"he give no reason?"""
837,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
838,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"""O, he said things about the Wordsworths,"" replied Sara. ""He thinks you"
839,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"have neglected him shamefully. So do I."" And she shut her mouth with a"
840,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,snap.
841,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
842,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Coleridge, though so prolific a conversationalist, and so prone to speech,"
843,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,knew when there was a time to be silent. He attempted no defence or
844,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"excuse. He simply went indoors, and sitting distastefully to an"
845,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"unprepossessing supper, let Sara say her say upon the subject of Lloyd: it"
846,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,was an extensive and a justifiable recrimination. Then--still in the same
847,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"abstracted and monosyllabic state,--he helped to wash up, attended--better"
848,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"late than never--to the pigs and fowls, and sat before the fire, with a"
849,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"note-book in his hands and baby-clothes pinned to warm upon his knees,"
850,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,while Sara put the child to bed. He was working out with patient care
851,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,those apparently unpremeditated effects which go to make up the haunting
852,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"melody of _Christabel_. For, skilful and accomplished metrist as he was,"
853,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"it was only by dint of ""repeated experiments and intense mental effort"""
854,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,that he achieved those results in which his art appears most artless.
855,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"However, he was in no fit state, over-tired and distressed as he felt, for"
856,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,laborious efforts of this kind: and presently Nature took vengeance upon
857,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"him in the form of intolerable toothache. A little while he bore it: then,"
858,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,moving tip-toe lest he should be heard in the upper room where Sara was
859,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"soothing the little one to sleep, he stole to a corner cupboard and took"
860,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,out a bottle of laudanum. In this false friend and insidious comforter he
861,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"had already found relief and repose from mental, as from physical"
862,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"troubles,--more and more frequently he had recourse to it. He knew its"
863,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"fatal tendency to undermine the will and debilitate the constitution, yet"
864,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"he could not deny himself an artificial peace which he described as ""a"
865,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"spot of enchantment, a green spot of fountains and trees in the very heart"
866,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"of a waste of sand."""
867,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
868,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And immediately he began to view things _couleur de rose_. The sharp
869,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,tongue and angry face of Sara became transmogrified into the gentle
870,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"semblance of her anagram, the imaginary _Asra_ of his poems,--"
871,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
872,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"To be beloved is all I need,"
873,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And whom I love I love indeed.
874,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
875,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,*       *       *       *       *
876,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
877,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,O ever--ever be thou blest!
878,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"For dearly, Asra! love I thee!"
879,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"This brooding warmth across my breast,"
880,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"This depth of tranquil bliss--ah, me!"
881,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Fount, tree and shed are gone, I know not whither,"
882,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,But in one quiet room we three are still together.
883,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
884,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"The shadows dance upon the wall,"
885,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,By the still dancing fire-flames made;
886,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And now they slumber moveless all!
887,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And now they melt to one deep shade!
888,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,But not from me shall this mild darkness steal thee:
889,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"I dream thee with mine eyes, and at my heart I feel thee!"
890,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
891,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"The visions born of opium floated in vague, rich phantasmagoria across his"
892,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"slumbrous brain,"
893,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
894,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"And so, his senses gradually wrapt"
895,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"In a half-sleep, he dreams of better worlds,"
896,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
897,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,--sitting in the failing firelight. With a great effort he roused himself
898,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"to creep up the stair-ladder, and to lay his drugged limbs upon the hard"
899,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,straw bed. The child and Sara were already dreaming: he gazed at them with
900,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,serene affection:
901,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
902,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Dear Babe, that sleepest cradled by my side,"
903,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Whose gentle breathings, heard in this deep calm,"
904,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Fill up the interspersed vacancies
905,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,And momentary pauses of the thought!
906,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,My babe so beautiful! it thrills my heart
907,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"With tender gladness, thus to look at thee!"
908,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
909,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"and lastly, with all the mental power yet left him, he committed himself"
910,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"to the God of whom he was so weak, so well-intentioned a worshipper:"
911,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
912,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Ere on my bed my limbs I lay,"
913,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,It hath not been my use to pray
914,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,With moving lips or bended knees;
915,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"But silently, by slow degress,"
916,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"My spirit I to Love compose,"
917,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"In humble trust mine eye-lids close,"
918,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"With reverential resignation,"
919,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"No wish conceived, no thought expressed."
920,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Only a _sense_ of supplication,--"
921,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,A sense o'er all my soul impressed
922,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"That I am weak, yet not unblest,"
923,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,"Since in me, round me, every where"
924,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,Eternal Strength and Wisdom are.
925,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,
926,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,But now the stealthy narcotic utterly beclouded him: he sank away as
927,A DAY WITH COLERIDGE.,through unfathomable gulfs of somnolence. Samuel Taylor Coleridge had
