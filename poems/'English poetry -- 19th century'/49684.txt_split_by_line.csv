45,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,
46,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,|The custom of inditing a preface is one which is perhaps more honoured
47,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,"in the breach than in the observance: nevertheless, I cannot allow the"
48,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,present opportunity to pass without returning my hearty thanks and
49,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,"acknowledgments to my Critics, and the Press generally, for the"
50,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,"indulgent consideration I have received at their hands, and for the"
51,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,"discriminating advice, of which, in revising this edition, I have gladly"
52,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,availed myself. Many of the minor pieces-introduced in the first
53,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,"instance principally as vehicles for illustrations have been omitted,"
54,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,and others of a somewhat less trivial character substituted.
55,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,
56,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,"These alterations have, to a certain extent, modified the original"
57,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,"design of the book, as conveyed by its title; but the unexpectedly"
58,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,"flattering reception accorded to the two most serious poems, the ""Night"
59,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,"Mail North,"" and the ""Derby Day,"" (the former haying been quoted at"
60,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,length in nine Reviews) led me to think that the change might not be
61,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,disadvantageous.
62,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,
63,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,I have had on the whole but few hard knocks to complain of; certainly
64,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,"fewer than, considering the nature of some of the poems, I had reason to"
65,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,"expect. For these adverse criticisms, which were no doubt the expression"
66,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,"of the genuine opinions of their writers, I bear no grudge. As the"
67,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,"Author of ""The Season"" pointedly phrases it, I could ""have escaped"
68,PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.,"censure only by escaping notice."""

2814,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2815,THE WELL OF TRUTH,Immaculate Havannah!--
2816,THE WELL OF TRUTH,

2903,THE WELL OF TRUTH,What mania could have got'em--
2904,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2905,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"The place was truth's historic well,"

2920,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2921,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"And every Sunday in the plate,"
2922,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2923,THE WELL OF TRUTH,His clinking gold was given
2924,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2925,THE WELL OF TRUTH,With such an air--the righteous vow'd
2926,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2927,THE WELL OF TRUTH,His alms had conquer'd Heaven!
2928,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2929,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2930,THE WELL OF TRUTH,And such his godly wrath'gainst all
2931,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2932,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"Who betted, swore, or liquor'd,--"
2933,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2934,THE WELL OF TRUTH,Old women said around his head

2938,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2939,THE WELL OF TRUTH,But looking through his heart I saw
2940,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2941,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"A blank, dark, moral torpor,--"
2942,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2943,THE WELL OF TRUTH,And while he gave his princely alms
2944,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2945,THE WELL OF TRUTH,He cursed the needy pauper.
2946,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2947,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2948,THE WELL OF TRUTH,And all men grovell'd at his feet
2949,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2950,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"With coax, and crawl, and wheedle;--"
2951,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2952,THE WELL OF TRUTH,But I thought of Dives' burning tongue
2953,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2954,THE WELL OF TRUTH,And the parabolic needle.
2955,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2956,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"And next I spied a priestly band,"

2958,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"In cassock, cope, and mitre,"
2959,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2960,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"Who diff'ring slightly from the Church,"
2961,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2962,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"Lent all their wits to spite her,--"
2963,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2964,THE WELL OF TRUTH,With some who thought church-music gave
2965,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2966,THE WELL OF TRUTH,The Devil grievous handles;
2967,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2968,THE WELL OF TRUTH,And some who lit Polemic War
2969,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2970,THE WELL OF TRUTH,By lighting altar-candles;
2971,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2972,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2973,THE WELL OF TRUTH,And one who held a certain place
2974,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2975,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"Most probable to get to,"
2976,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2977,THE WELL OF TRUTH,Unless he preach'd in a scarlet cloak
2978,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2979,THE WELL OF TRUTH,And pray'd in a _falsetto!_--
2980,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2981,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2982,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"But _one_ thing I could plainly read,"
2983,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2984,THE WELL OF TRUTH,On ev'ry breast displaying;--
2985,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2986,THE WELL OF TRUTH,The rev'rend men took more delight
2987,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2988,THE WELL OF TRUTH,In quarrelling than praying!
2989,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2990,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2991,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"They pass'd--and lo! an Hebrew youth,"
2992,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2993,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"To ebon locks confessing,"
2994,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2995,THE WELL OF TRUTH,The sturdy yeomanry of Bucks
2996,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2997,THE WELL OF TRUTH,In honey'd phrase addressing.
2998,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
2999,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3000,THE WELL OF TRUTH,And so enthusiastic wax'd
3001,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3002,THE WELL OF TRUTH,The sleek bucolic charmer;
3003,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3004,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"As if his body, soul, and brains,"
3005,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3006,THE WELL OF TRUTH,Had all been born a farmer.
3007,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3008,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3009,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"And he felt ""glad"" and ""proud,"" he said,"
3010,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3011,THE WELL OF TRUTH,To meet his friends again--
3012,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3013,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"""His valued friends!""--and in his heart"
3014,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3015,THE WELL OF TRUTH,He wished himself in Spain;--
3016,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3017,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3018,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"Of all spots in the world, he said,"
3019,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3020,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"To see them  _there_ he'd rather,--"
3021,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3022,THE WELL OF TRUTH,And inly sent them ev'ry one
3023,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3024,THE WELL OF TRUTH,To Jericho--or farther.
3025,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3026,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3027,THE WELL OF TRUTH,And so he gave their right good health--
3028,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3029,THE WELL OF TRUTH,And off it went in toppers;
3030,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3031,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"And call'd them ""Men and Patriots,"""
3032,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3033,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"And in his heart ""Clodhoppers.""--"
3034,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3035,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3036,THE WELL OF TRUTH,And then--with very blandest smiles--
3037,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3038,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"From self and boon carousers,"
3039,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3040,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"Gave prizes to some model louts,"
3041,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3042,THE WELL OF TRUTH,And one _a pair of trousers!!_ *
3043,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3044,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"* Vide ""Times"" of 4 Nov. 1857, giving an account of the meeting"
3045,THE WELL OF TRUTH,of the Amersham and Chesham Agricultural Association.

3048,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"And as he cried ""Take, fine old man,"

3050,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"""These best of merit's brandings,""--"
3051,THE WELL OF TRUTH,

3055,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3056,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"Just then roll'd by, so bluff and bold,"
3057,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3058,THE WELL OF TRUTH,A tar--from truck to kelson--
3059,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3060,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"And prophesied such vast exploits,"
3061,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3062,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"Men cried--""Another Nelson!"""
3063,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3064,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"""You'll see,"" quoth he, ""_I'll_ shortly be"
3065,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3066,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"""In Heav'n or Cronstadt reckon'd""--"
3067,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3068,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"But never meant to chance the _first_,"
3069,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3070,THE WELL OF TRUTH,Or go too near the _second_.
3071,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3072,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3073,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"And then I lost him in the crowd,"
3074,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3075,THE WELL OF TRUTH,Nor could the question try on;
3076,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3077,THE WELL OF TRUTH,If I'd heard the voice of Balaam's ass
3078,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3079,THE WELL OF TRUTH,Or the roar of Britain's lion;
3080,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3081,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3082,THE WELL OF TRUTH,But when I thought what bumping things
3083,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3084,THE WELL OF TRUTH,"The hero had been saying,"
3085,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3086,THE WELL OF TRUTH,I felt I knew what Gray must mean
3087,THE WELL OF TRUTH,
3088,THE WELL OF TRUTH,By the din of battle _braying_.--
