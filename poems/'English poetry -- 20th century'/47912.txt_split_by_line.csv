80,THE BURNING WHEEL.,
81,THE BURNING WHEEL.,
82,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"Wearied of its own turning,"
83,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"Distressed with its own busy restlessness,"
84,THE BURNING WHEEL.,Yearning to draw the circumferent pain--
85,THE BURNING WHEEL.,The rim that is dizzy with speed--
86,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"To the motionless centre, there to rest,"
87,THE BURNING WHEEL.,The wheel must strain through agony
88,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"On agony contracting, returning"
89,THE BURNING WHEEL.,Into the core of steel.
90,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"And at last the wheel has rest, is still,"
91,THE BURNING WHEEL.,Shrunk to an adamant core:
92,THE BURNING WHEEL.,Fulfilling its will in fixity.
93,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"But the yearning atoms, as they grind"
94,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"Closer and closer, more and more"
95,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"Fiercely together, beget"
96,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"A flaming fire upward leaping,"
97,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"Billowing out in a burning,"
98,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"Passionate, fierce desire to find"
99,THE BURNING WHEEL.,The infinite calm of the mother's breast.
100,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"And there the flame is a Christ-child sleeping,"
101,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"Bright, tenderly radiant;"
102,THE BURNING WHEEL.,All bitterness lost in the infinite
103,THE BURNING WHEEL.,Peace of the mother's bosom.
104,THE BURNING WHEEL.,But death comes creeping in a tide
105,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"Of slow oblivion, till the flame in fear"
106,THE BURNING WHEEL.,Wakes from the sleep of its quiet brightness
107,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"And burns with a darkening passion and pain,"
108,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"Lest, all forgetting in quiet, it perish."
109,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"And as it burns and anguishes it quickens,"
110,THE BURNING WHEEL.,Begetting once again the wheel that yearns--
111,THE BURNING WHEEL.,Sick with its speed--for the terrible stillness
112,THE BURNING WHEEL.,Of the adamant core and the steel-hard chain.
113,THE BURNING WHEEL.,And so once more
114,THE BURNING WHEEL.,Shall the wheel revolve till its anguish cease
115,THE BURNING WHEEL.,In the iron anguish of fixity;
116,THE BURNING WHEEL.,Till once again
117,THE BURNING WHEEL.,"Flame billows out to infinity,"
118,THE BURNING WHEEL.,Sinking to a sleep of brightness
119,THE BURNING WHEEL.,In that vast oblivious peace.

131,DOORS OF THE TEMPLE.,And these are the gates that God decreed
132,DOORS OF THE TEMPLE.,"Should lead to his house:--kisses and wine,"
133,DOORS OF THE TEMPLE.,"Cool depths of thought, youth without rest,"
134,DOORS OF THE TEMPLE.,"And calm old age, prayer and desire,"

156,VILLIERS DE L'ISLE-ADAM.,"The name, a gift of yearnings and despairs"
157,VILLIERS DE L'ISLE-ADAM.,Too greatly noble for this iron age.
158,VILLIERS DE L'ISLE-ADAM.,
159,VILLIERS DE L'ISLE-ADAM.,"Time moved for you not in quotidian beats,"
160,VILLIERS DE L'ISLE-ADAM.,But in the long slow rhythm the ages keep
161,VILLIERS DE L'ISLE-ADAM.,In their immortal symphony. You taught
162,VILLIERS DE L'ISLE-ADAM.,That not in the harsh turmoil of the streets
163,VILLIERS DE L'ISLE-ADAM.,Does life consist; you bade the soul drink deep

175,DARKNESS.,In the core of the gazer's chrysolite ...
176,DARKNESS.,The mystic darkness that laps God's throne
177,DARKNESS.,"In a splendour beyond imagining,"
178,DARKNESS.,So passing bright.
179,DARKNESS.,
180,DARKNESS.,But the many twisted darknesses
181,DARKNESS.,"That range the city to and fro,"
182,DARKNESS.,In aimless subtlety pass and part
183,DARKNESS.,And ebb and glutinously flow;
184,DARKNESS.,"Darkness of lust and avarice,"

192,MOLE.,
193,MOLE.,
194,MOLE.,Tunnelled in solid blackness creeps
195,MOLE.,"The old mole-soul, and wakes or sleeps,"
196,MOLE.,"He knows not which, but tunnels on"
197,MOLE.,Through ages of oblivion;
198,MOLE.,Until at last the long constraint
199,MOLE.,"Of each-hand wall is lost, and faint"
200,MOLE.,"Comes daylight creeping from afar,"
201,MOLE.,And mole-work grows crepuscular.
202,MOLE.,Tunnel meets air and bursts; mole sees
203,MOLE.,Men hugely walking ... or are they trees?
204,MOLE.,"And far horizons smoking blue,"
205,MOLE.,And chasing clouds for ever new?
206,MOLE.,"Green hills, like lighted lamps aglow"
207,MOLE.,Or quenching 'neath the cloud-shadow;
208,MOLE.,"Quenching and blazing turn by turn,"
209,MOLE.,Spring's great green signals fitfully burn.
210,MOLE.,"Mole travels on, but finds the steering"
211,MOLE.,A harder task of pioneering
212,MOLE.,Than when he thridded through the strait
213,MOLE.,Blind catacombs that ancient fate
214,MOLE.,Had carved for him. Stupid and dumb
215,MOLE.,And blind and touchless he had come
216,MOLE.,"A way without a turn; but here,"
217,MOLE.,"Under the sky, the passenger"
218,MOLE.,Chooses his own best way; and mole
219,MOLE.,"Distracted wanders, yet his hole"
220,MOLE.,"Regrets not much wherein he crept,"
221,MOLE.,"But runs, a joyous nympholept,"
222,MOLE.,"This way and that, by all made mad--"
223,MOLE.,"River nymph and oread,"
224,MOLE.,"Ocean's daughters and Lorelei,"
225,MOLE.,"Combing the silken mystery,"
226,MOLE.,The glaucous gold of her rivery tresses--
227,MOLE.,"Each haunts the traveller, each possesses"
228,MOLE.,The drunken wavering soul awhile;
229,MOLE.,Then with a phantom's cock-crow smile
230,MOLE.,Mocks craving with sheer vanishment.
231,MOLE.,
232,MOLE.,Mole-eyes grow hawk's: knowledge is lent
233,MOLE.,In grudging driblets that pay high
234,MOLE.,Unconscionable usury
235,MOLE.,To unrelenting life. Mole learns
236,MOLE.,To travel more secure; the turns
237,MOLE.,"Of his long way less puzzling seem,"
238,MOLE.,And all those magic forms that gleam
239,MOLE.,In airy invitation cheat
240,MOLE.,Less often than they did of old.
241,MOLE.,
242,MOLE.,"The earth slopes upward, fold by fold"
243,MOLE.,Of quiet hills that meet the gold
244,MOLE.,Serenity of western skies.
245,MOLE.,Over the world's edge with clear eyes
246,MOLE.,Our mole transcendent sees his way
247,MOLE.,Tunnelled in light: he must obey
248,MOLE.,Necessity again and thrid
249,MOLE.,"Close catacombs as erst he did,"
250,MOLE.,"Fate's tunnellings, himself must bore"
251,MOLE.,Through the sunset's inmost core.
252,MOLE.,The guiding walls to each-hand shine
253,MOLE.,Luminous and crystalline;
254,MOLE.,"And mole shall tunnel on and on,"
255,MOLE.,Till night let fall oblivion.

301,TWO REALITIES.,
302,TWO REALITIES.,"Our souls are elephants, thought I,"
