65,I.,I.
66,I.,
67,I.,"So I have known this life,"
68,I.,"These beads of coloured days,"
69,I.,This self the string.
70,I.,What is this thing?
71,I.,
72,I.,"Not beauty, no; not greed,"
73,I.,"O, not indeed;"
74,I.,"Not all, though much;"
75,I.,Its colour is not such.
76,I.,
77,I.,"It has no eyes to see,"
78,I.,It has no ears;
79,I.,It is a red hour's war
80,I.,Followed by tears.
81,I.,
82,I.,"It is an hour of time,"
83,I.,"An hour of road,"
84,I.,Flesh is its goad;
85,I.,"Yet, in the sorrowing lands,"
86,I.,Women and men take hands.
87,I.,
88,I.,"O earth, give us the corn,"
89,I.,"Come rain, come sun;"
90,I.,We men who have been born
91,I.,Have tasks undone.
92,I.,Out of this earth
93,I.,"Comes the thing birth,"
94,I.,"The thing unguessed, unwon."
95,I.,
96,I.,
97,I.,
98,I.,
99,II.,II.
100,II.,
101,II.,"O wretched man, that for a little mile"
102,II.,"Crawls beneath heaven for his brother's blood,"
103,II.,"Whose days the planets number with their style,"
104,II.,"To whom all earth is slave, all living, food!"
105,II.,"O withering man, within whose folded shell"
106,II.,"Lies yet the seed, the spirit's quickening corn,"
107,II.,That Time and Sun will change out of the cell
108,II.,"Into green meadows, in the world unborn!"
109,II.,"If Beauty be a dream, do but resolve"
110,II.,"And fire shall come, that in the stubborn clay"
111,II.,"Works to make perfect till the rocks dissolve,"
112,II.,"The barriers burst, and Beauty takes her way:"
113,II.,"Beauty herself, within whose blossoming Spring"
114,II.,Even wretched man shall clap his hands and sing.
115,II.,
116,II.,
117,II.,
118,II.,
119,III.,III.
120,III.,
121,III.,Out of the special cell's most special sense
122,III.,Came the suggestion when the light was sweet;
123,III.,"All skill, all beauty, all magnificence,"
124,III.,"Are hints so caught, man's glimpse of the complete."
125,III.,"And, though the body rots, that sense survives;"
126,III.,"Being of life's own essence, it endures"
127,III.,(Fruit of the spirit's tillage in men's lives)
128,III.,Round all this ghost that wandering flesh immures.
129,III.,"That is our friend, who, when the iron brain"
130,III.,"Assails, or the earth clogs, or the sun hides,"
131,III.,"Is the good God to whom none calls in vain,"
132,III.,"Man's Achieved Good, which, being Life, abides:"
133,III.,"The man-made God, that man in happy breath"
134,III.,Makes in despite of Time and dusty Death.
135,III.,
136,III.,
137,III.,
138,III.,
139,IV.,IV.
140,IV.,
141,IV.,You are the link which binds us each to each.
142,IV.,"Passion, or too much thought, alone can end"
143,IV.,"Beauty, the ghost, the spirit's common speech,"
144,IV.,Which man's red longing left us for our friend.
145,IV.,"Even in the blinding war I have known this,"
146,IV.,That flesh is but the carrier of a ghost
147,IV.,"Who, through his longing, touches that which is"
148,IV.,Even as the sailor knows the foreign coast.
149,IV.,So by the bedside of the dying black
150,IV.,I felt our uncouth souls subtly made one:
151,IV.,"Forgiven, the meanness of each other's lack;"
152,IV.,"Forgiven, the petty tale of ill things done."
153,IV.,"We were but Man, who for a tale of days"
154,IV.,Seeks the one city by a million ways.

158,IV.,
159,V.,V.
160,V.,
161,V.,"I could not sleep for thinking of the sky,"
162,V.,"The unending sky, with all its million suns"
163,V.,Which turn their planets everlastingly
164,V.,"In nothing, where the fire-haired comet runs."
165,V.,"If I could sail that nothing, I should cross"
166,V.,Silence and emptiness with dark stars passing;
167,V.,"Then, in the darkness, see a point of gloss"
168,V.,"Burn to a glow, and glare, and keep amassing,"
169,V.,"And rage into a sun with wandering planets,"
170,V.,"And drop behind; and then, as I proceed,"
171,V.,See his last light upon his last moon's granites
172,V.,Die to a dark that would be night indeed:
173,V.,Night where my soul might sail a million years
174,V.,"In nothing, not even Death, not even tears."
175,V.,
176,V.,
177,V.,
178,V.,
179,VI.,VI.
180,VI.,
181,VI.,"How did the nothing come, how did these fires,"
182,VI.,"These million-leagues of fires, first toss their hair,"
183,VI.,"Licking the moons from heaven in their ires,"
184,VI.,Flinging them forth for them to wander there?
185,VI.,What was the Mind?  Was it a mind which thought?
186,VI.,Or chance? or law? or conscious law? or power?
187,VI.,Or a vast balance by vast clashes wrought?
188,VI.,Or Time at trial with Matter for an hour?
189,VI.,Or is it all a body where the cells
190,VI.,"Are living things supporting something strange,"
191,VI.,Whose mighty heart the singing planet swells
192,VI.,As it shoulders nothing in unending change?
193,VI.,Is this green earth of many-peopled pain
194,VI.,"Part of a life, a cell within a brain?"
195,VI.,
196,VI.,
197,VI.,
198,VI.,
199,VII.,VII.
200,VII.,
201,VII.,It may be so; but let the unknown be.
202,VII.,"We, on this earth, are servants of the sun:"
203,VII.,"Out of the sun comes all the quick in me,"
204,VII.,His golden touch is life to everyone.
205,VII.,His power it is that makes us spin through space;
206,VII.,His youth is April and his manhood bread;
207,VII.,Beauty is but a looking on his face;
208,VII.,"He clears the mind, he makes the roses red."
209,VII.,"What he may be, who knows?  But we are his;"
210,VII.,"We roll through nothing round him, year by year,"
211,VII.,"The withering leaves upon a tree which is,"
212,VII.,"Each with his greed, his little power, his fear,"
213,VII.,"What we may be, who knows?  But every one"
214,VII.,Is dust on dust a servant of the sun.
215,VII.,
216,VII.,
217,VII.,
218,VII.,
219,VIII.,VIII.
220,VIII.,
221,VIII.,The Kings go by with jewelled crowns;
222,VIII.,"Their horses gleam, their banners shake, their spears are many."
223,VIII.,The sack of many-peopled towns
224,VIII.,Is all their dream;
225,VIII.,The way they take
226,VIII.,"Leaves but a ruin in the brake,"
227,VIII.,"And, in the furrow that the ploughmen make,"
228,VIII.,"A stampless penny: a tale, a dream."
229,VIII.,
230,VIII.,The merchants reckon up their gold;
231,VIII.,"Their letters come, their ships arrive, their freights are glories;"
232,VIII.,The profits of their treasures sold
233,VIII.,They tell and sum;
234,VIII.,Their foremen drive
235,VIII.,"The servants starved to half-alive,"
236,VIII.,Whose labours do but make the earth a hive
237,VIII.,"Of stinking stories: a tale, a dream."
238,VIII.,
239,VIII.,The priests are singing in their stalls;
240,VIII.,"Their singing lifts, their incense burns, their praying clamours;"
241,VIII.,Yet God is as the sparrow falls;
242,VIII.,"The ivy drifts,"
243,VIII.,The votive urns
244,VIII.,Are all left void when Fortune turns;
245,VIII.,The god is but a marble for the kerns
246,VIII.,"To break with hammers: a tale, a dream."
247,VIII.,
248,VIII.,"O Beauty, let me know again"
249,VIII.,"The green earth cold, the April rain, the quiet waters figuring sky,"
250,VIII.,The one star risen.
251,VIII.,
252,VIII.,So shall I pass into the feast
253,VIII.,"Not touched by King, merchant, or priest;"
254,VIII.,"Know the red spirit of the beast,"
255,VIII.,Be the green grain;
256,VIII.,Escape from prison.
257,VIII.,
258,VIII.,
259,VIII.,
260,VIII.,
261,IX.,IX.
262,IX.,
263,IX.,What is this life which uses living cells
264,IX.,"It knows not how nor why, for no known end,"
265,IX.,This soul of man upon whose fragile shells
266,IX.,Of blood and brain his very powers depend?
267,IX.,"Pour out its little blood or touch its brain,"
268,IX.,"The thing is helpless, gone, no longer known;"
269,IX.,"The carrion cells are never man again,"
270,IX.,No hand relights the little candle blown.
271,IX.,"It comes not from Without, but from the sperm"
272,IX.,Fed in the womb; it is a man-made thing
273,IX.,"That takes from man its power to live a term,"
274,IX.,Served by live cells of which it is the King.
275,IX.,Can it be blood and brain?  It is most great.
276,IX.,Through blood and brain alone it wrestles Fate.
277,IX.,
278,IX.,
279,IX.,
280,IX.,
281,X.,X.
282,X.,
283,X.,"Can it be blood and brain, this transient force"
284,X.,"Which, by an impulse, seizes flesh and grows"
285,X.,"To man, the thing less splendid than the horse,"
286,X.,"More blind than owls, less lovely than the rose?"
287,X.,"O, by a power unknown it works the cells"
288,X.,Of blood and brain; it has the power to see
289,X.,Beyond the apparent thing the something else
290,X.,Which it inspires dust to bring to be.
291,X.,"Both blood and brain are its imperfect tools,"
292,X.,"Easily wrecked, soon worn, slow to attain;"
293,X.,Only by years of toil the master rules
294,X.,"To lovely ends those servants, blood and brain."
295,X.,"And Death, a touch, a germ, has still the force"
296,X.,"To make him ev'n as the rose, the owl, the horse."
297,X.,
298,X.,
299,X.,
300,X.,
301,XI.,XI.
302,XI.,
303,XI.,Not only blood and brain its servants are;
304,XI.,"There is a finer power that needs no slaves,"
305,XI.,"Whose lovely service distance cannot bar,"
306,XI.,Nor the green sea with all her hell of waves;
307,XI.,"Nor snowy mountains, nor the desert sand,"
308,XI.,"Nor heat, nor storm, it bends to no control;"
309,XI.,It is a stretching of the spirit's hand
310,XI.,To touch the brother's or the sister's soul;
311,XI.,So that from darkness in the narrow room
312,XI.,"I can step forth and be about her heart,"
313,XI.,"Needing no star, no lantern in the gloom,"
314,XI.,"No word from her, no pointing on the chart,"
315,XI.,Only red knowledge of a window flung
316,XI.,"Wide to the night, and calling without tongue."
317,XI.,
318,XI.,
319,XI.,
320,XI.,
321,XII.,XII.
322,XII.,
323,XII.,"Drop me the seed, that I even in my brain"
324,XII.,May be its nourishing earth.  No mortal knows
325,XII.,"From what immortal granary comes the grain,"
326,XII.,Nor how the earth conspires to make the rose;
327,XII.,But from the dust and from the wetted mud
328,XII.,"Comes help, given or taken; so with me,"
329,XII.,Deep in my brain the essence of my blood
330,XII.,Shall give it stature until Beauty be.
331,XII.,"It will look down, even as the burning flower"
332,XII.,"Smiles upon June, long after I am gone."
333,XII.,"Dust-footed Time will never tell its hour,"
334,XII.,"Through dusty Time its rose will draw men on,"
335,XII.,Through dusty Time its beauty will make plain
336,XII.,"Man, and, Without, a spirit-scattering grain."
337,XII.,
338,XII.,
339,XII.,
340,XII.,
341,XIII.,XIII.
342,XIII.,
343,XIII.,"Ah, but Without there is no spirit scattering;"
344,XIII.,"Nothing but Life, most fertile but unwise,"
345,XIII.,"Passing through change in the sun's heat and cloud's watering,"
346,XIII.,"Pregnant with self, unlit by inner eyes."
347,XIII.,"There is no sower, nor seed for any tillage;"
348,XIII.,"Nothing but the grey brain's pash, and the tense will,"
349,XIII.,And that poor fool of the Being's little village
350,XIII.,Feeling for the truth in the little veins that thrill.
351,XIII.,"There is no Sowing, but digging, year by year,"
352,XIII.,"In a hill's heart, now one way, now another,"
353,XIII.,"Till the rock breaks and the valley is made clear,"
354,XIII.,"And the poor Fool stands, and knows the sun for his brother,"
355,XIII.,"And the Soul shakes wings like a bird escaped from cage,"
356,XIII.,And the tribe moves on to camp in its heritage.
357,XIII.,

359,XIII.,
360,XIII.,
361,XIV.,XIV.
362,XIV.,
363,XIV.,"You are too beautiful for mortal eyes,"
364,XIV.,You the divine unapprehended soul;
365,XIV.,The red worm in the marrow of the wise
366,XIV.,"Stirs as you pass, but never sees you whole."
367,XIV.,Even as the watcher in the midnight tower
368,XIV.,"Knows from a change in heaven an unseen star,"
369,XIV.,"So from your beauty, so from the summer flower,"
370,XIV.,"So from the light, one guesses what you are."
371,XIV.,So in the darkness does the traveller come
372,XIV.,"To some lit chink, through which he cannot see,"
373,XIV.,"More than a light, nor hear, more than a hum,"
374,XIV.,Of the great hall where Kings in council be.
375,XIV.,"So, in the grave, the red and mouthless worm"
376,XIV.,Knows of the soul that held his body firm.
377,XIV.,
378,XIV.,
379,XIV.,
380,XIV.,
381,XV.,XV.
382,XV.,
383,XV.,Is it a sea on which the souls embark
384,XV.,"Out of the body, as men put to sea?"
385,XV.,Or do we come like candles in the dark
386,XV.,In the rooms in cities in eternity?
387,XV.,Is it a darkness that our powers can light?
388,XV.,"Is this, our little lantern of man's love,"
389,XV.,A help to find friends wandering in the night
390,XV.,In the unknown country with no star above?
391,XV.,"Or is it sleep, unknowing, outlasting clocks"
392,XV.,"That outlast men, that, though the cockcrow ring,"
393,XV.,"Is but one peace, of the substance of the rocks;"
394,XV.,Is but one space in the now unquickened thing;
395,XV.,"Is but one joy, that, though the million tire,"
396,XV.,"Is one, always the same, one life, one fire?"

407,THE ORE.,
408,THE ORE.,Before Man's labouring wisdom gave me birth
409,THE ORE.,I had not even seen the light of day;
410,THE ORE.,"Down in the central darkness of the earth,"
411,THE ORE.,"Crushed by the weight of continents I lay,"
412,THE ORE.,"Ground by the weight to heat, not knowing then"

417,THE TREES.,
418,THE TREES.,"We grew on mountains where the glaciers cry,"
419,THE TREES.,Infinite sombre armies of us stood
420,THE TREES.,Below the snow-peaks which defy the sky;
421,THE TREES.,A song like the gods moaning filled our wood;
422,THE TREES.,"We knew no men; our life was to stand stanch,"
423,THE TREES.,"Singing our song, against the avalanche."

429,THE HEMP AND FLAX.,"A million herbs which bowed as the wind blew,"
430,THE HEMP AND FLAX.,"Trembling in every fibre, never still;"
431,THE HEMP AND FLAX.,Out of the summer earth sweet life we drew.
432,THE HEMP AND FLAX.,"Little blue-flowered grasses up the glen,"
433,THE HEMP AND FLAX.,"Glad of the sun, what did we know of men?"

438,THE WORKERS.,"We tore the iron from the mountain's hold,"
439,THE WORKERS.,By blasting fires we smithied it to steel;
440,THE WORKERS.,Out of the shapeless stone we learned to mould
441,THE WORKERS.,"The sweeping bow, the rectilinear keel;"
442,THE WORKERS.,"We hewed the pine to plank, we split the fir,"
443,THE WORKERS.,We pulled the myriad flax to fashion her.
444,THE WORKERS.,
445,THE WORKERS.,"Out of a million lives our knowledge came,"
446,THE WORKERS.,A million subtle craftsmen forged the means;
447,THE WORKERS.,"Steam was our handmaid, and our servant flame,"

478,THE BLACKSMITH,
479,THE BLACKSMITH,The blacksmith in his sparky forge
480,THE BLACKSMITH,Beat on the white-hot softness there;
481,THE BLACKSMITH,Ever as he beat he sang an air
482,THE BLACKSMITH,To keep the sparks out of his gorge.
483,THE BLACKSMITH,
484,THE BLACKSMITH,"So many shoes the blacksmith beat,"
485,THE BLACKSMITH,"So many shares and links for traces,"
486,THE BLACKSMITH,"So many builders' struts and braces,"
487,THE BLACKSMITH,"Such tackling for the chain-fore-sheet,"
488,THE BLACKSMITH,
489,THE BLACKSMITH,"That, in his pride, big words he spake:"
490,THE BLACKSMITH,"""I am the master of my trade;"
491,THE BLACKSMITH,"What iron is good for I have made,"
492,THE BLACKSMITH,"I make what is in iron to make."""
493,THE BLACKSMITH,
494,THE BLACKSMITH,"Daily he sang thus by his fire,"
495,THE BLACKSMITH,"Till one day, as he poised his stroke"
496,THE BLACKSMITH,"Above his bar, the iron spoke;"
497,THE BLACKSMITH,"""You boaster, drop your hammer, liar!"""
498,THE BLACKSMITH,
499,THE BLACKSMITH,"The hammer dropped out of his hand,"
500,THE BLACKSMITH,"The iron rose, it gathered shape,"
501,THE BLACKSMITH,"It took the blacksmith by the nape,"
502,THE BLACKSMITH,"It pressed him to the furnace, and"
503,THE BLACKSMITH,
504,THE BLACKSMITH,Heaped fire upon him till his form
505,THE BLACKSMITH,"Was molten, flinging sparks aloft,"
506,THE BLACKSMITH,"Until his bones were melted soft,"
507,THE BLACKSMITH,His hairs crisped in a fiery storm.
508,THE BLACKSMITH,
509,THE BLACKSMITH,The iron drew him from the blaze
510,THE BLACKSMITH,To place him on the anvil; then
511,THE BLACKSMITH,"It beat him from the shape of men,"
512,THE BLACKSMITH,Like drugs the apothecary brays;
513,THE BLACKSMITH,
514,THE BLACKSMITH,"Beat him to ploughing coulters, beat"
515,THE BLACKSMITH,"Body and blood to links of chain,"
516,THE BLACKSMITH,With endless hammerings of pain

1858,LXVI.,There was an evil in the nodding wood
1859,LXVI.,"Above the quarry long since overgrown,"
1860,LXVI.,Something which stamped it as a place of blood
1861,LXVI.,Where tortured spirit cried from murdered bone.
1862,LXVI.,"Then, after years, I saw a rusty knife"
1863,LXVI.,"Stuck in a woman's skull, just as 'twas found,"
1864,LXVI.,"Blackt with a centuried crust of clotted life,"
1865,LXVI.,In the red clay of that unholy ground.
1866,LXVI.,"So that I knew the unhappy thing had spoken,"
1867,LXVI.,"That tongueless thing for whom the quarry spoke,"
1868,LXVI.,The evil seals of murder had been broken
1869,LXVI.,"By the red earth, the grass, the rooted oak,"
1870,LXVI.,"The inarticulate dead had forced the spade,"
1871,LXVI.,"The hand, the mind, till murder was displayed."

1879,LXVII.,In the grave's darkness let the stamp be lost.
1880,LXVII.,"The water still will bubble from the hill,"
1881,LXVII.,And April quick the meadows with her ghost;
1882,LXVII.,"Over the grass the daffodils will shiver,"
1883,LXVII.,"The primroses with their pale beauty abound,"
1884,LXVII.,The blackbird be a lover and make quiver
1885,LXVII.,With his glad singing the great soul of the ground;
1886,LXVII.,"So that if the body rot, it will not matter;"
1887,LXVII.,"Up in the earth the great game will go on,"
1888,LXVII.,"The coming of spring and the running of the water,"
1889,LXVII.,And the young things glad of the womb's darkness gone.
1890,LXVII.,And the joy we felt will be a part of the glory
1891,LXVII.,In the lover's kiss that makes the old couple's story.

1900,LXVIII.,"Is vision of you, marred, I have endured,"
1901,LXVIII.,"Tempted or fall'n, to look upon your face."
1902,LXVIII.,"Now through the grinning death's-head in the paint,"
1903,LXVIII.,"Within the tavern-song, hid in the wine,"
1904,LXVIII.,"In many-kinded man, emperor and saint,"
1905,LXVIII.,"I see you pass, you breath of the divine."
1906,LXVIII.,"I see you pass, as centuries ago"
1907,LXVIII.,The long dead men with passionate spirit saw.
1908,LXVIII.,"O brother man, whom spirit habits so,"
1909,LXVIII.,"Through your red sorrows Beauty keeps her law,"
1910,LXVIII.,"Beauty herself, who takes your dying hand,"

1921,LIX.,"What shall I be, that spot in the unknown?"
1922,LIX.,A glow-worm in a night that floats the sun?
1923,LIX.,Or deathless dust feeling the passer's foot?
1924,LIX.,An eye undying mourning things undone?
1925,LIX.,Or seed for quickening free from prisoning fruit?
1926,LIX.,"Or an eternal jewel on your robe,"
1927,LIX.,"Caught to your heart, one with the April tire"
1928,LIX.,"That made me yours as man upon the globe,"
1929,LIX.,"One with the spring, a breath in all desire,"

1941,LX.,Flies will be happy many summers hence.
1942,LX.,"Time with his antique breeds that built the Sphinx,"
1943,LX.,"Time with her men to come whose wings will tower,"
1944,LX.,"Poured and will pour, not as the wise man thinks,"
1945,LX.,"But with blind force, to each his little hour."
1946,LX.,"And when the hour has struck, comes death or change,"
1947,LX.,"Which, whether good or ill we cannot tell,"
1948,LX.,But the blind planet will wander through her range
1949,LX.,Bearing men like us who will serve as well.

1951,LX.,Will blow our dust that once were men in love.
