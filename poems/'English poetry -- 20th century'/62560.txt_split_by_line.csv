1681,STOPPING PLACE,"The world grows furry, grunts with sleep ..."
1682,STOPPING PLACE,But I must on the surface keep.
1683,STOPPING PLACE,The jolting of the train to me
1684,STOPPING PLACE,Seems some primeval vertebræ
1685,STOPPING PLACE,Attached by life-nerves to my brain--
1686,STOPPING PLACE,Reactionary once again.
1687,STOPPING PLACE,So that I see shapes crude and new
1688,STOPPING PLACE,"And ordered,--with some end in view,"
1689,STOPPING PLACE,No longer with the horny eyes
1690,STOPPING PLACE,Of other people’s memories.
1691,STOPPING PLACE,"Through highly varnished yellow heat,"
1692,STOPPING PLACE,"As through a lens that does not fit,"
1693,STOPPING PLACE,"The faces jolt in cubes, and I"
1694,STOPPING PLACE,Perceive their odd solidity
1695,STOPPING PLACE,And lack of meaning absolute:
1696,STOPPING PLACE,"For why should noses thus protrude,"
1697,STOPPING PLACE,And to what purpose can relate
1698,STOPPING PLACE,Each hair so oddly separate?
1699,STOPPING PLACE,"Anchored against the puff of breeze,"
1700,STOPPING PLACE,"As shallow as the crude blue seas,"
1701,STOPPING PLACE,The coloured blocks and cubes of faces
1702,STOPPING PLACE,Seem Noah’s arks that shelter races
1703,STOPPING PLACE,Of far absurdities to breed
1704,STOPPING PLACE,Their queer kind after we are dead.
1705,STOPPING PLACE,Blue wooden foliage creaks with heat
1706,STOPPING PLACE,And there are woollen buns to eat--
1707,STOPPING PLACE,Bright-varnished buns to touch and see
1708,STOPPING PLACE,"And, black as an Inferno, tea."
1709,STOPPING PLACE,Then (Recketts’ blue) a puff of wind....
1710,STOPPING PLACE,Heredity regains my mind
1711,STOPPING PLACE,And I am sitting in the train
1712,STOPPING PLACE,"While thought becomes like flesh,--the brain"
1713,STOPPING PLACE,"Not independent, but derived"
1714,STOPPING PLACE,From hairy matter that half lived--
1715,STOPPING PLACE,Identities not round or whole.
1716,STOPPING PLACE,"A questing beast who thirsts for soul,"
1717,STOPPING PLACE,The furry vegetation there--
1718,STOPPING PLACE,"Purring with heat, sucks in the air;"
1719,STOPPING PLACE,"And dust that’s gathered in the train,"
1720,STOPPING PLACE,"Protecting flesh, seems almost brain--"
1721,STOPPING PLACE,(That horny substance altering sight);
1722,STOPPING PLACE,"How strange, intangible is light"
1723,STOPPING PLACE,"Whence all is born, and yet by touch"
1724,STOPPING PLACE,"We live,--the rest is not worth much...."
1725,STOPPING PLACE,"Once more the world grows furred with sleep,--"
1726,STOPPING PLACE,But I must on the surface keep
1727,STOPPING PLACE,While mammoths from the heat are born--
1728,STOPPING PLACE,Great clumsy trains with tusk and horn
1729,STOPPING PLACE,Whereon the world’s too sudden tossed
1730,STOPPING PLACE,"Through frondage of our mind, and lost."

2263,THE SPIDER,"And foul white film; so close it lies,"
2264,THE SPIDER,It feeds upon my lips and eyes.
2265,THE SPIDER,
2266,THE SPIDER,The black fly hits the window-pane
2267,THE SPIDER,That shuts its dirty body in;
2268,THE SPIDER,"So once, his spirit fought to quit"
2269,THE SPIDER,The body that imprisoned it.
2270,THE SPIDER,
2271,THE SPIDER,"He always seemed so fond of me,"
2272,THE SPIDER,Until one day he chanced to see
2273,THE SPIDER,"My head, a little on one side,"
2274,THE SPIDER,Loll softly as if I had died.
2275,THE SPIDER,
2276,THE SPIDER,"Since then, he rarely looked my way,"
2277,THE SPIDER,Though he could never know what lay
2278,THE SPIDER,"Within my brain; though iron his will,"
2279,THE SPIDER,"I thought, he’s young and teachable."
2280,THE SPIDER,
2281,THE SPIDER,"And often, as I took my drink,"
2282,THE SPIDER,I chuckled in my heart to think
2283,THE SPIDER,Whose dark blood ran within his veins:
2284,THE SPIDER,"You see, it spared me half my pains."
2285,THE SPIDER,
2286,THE SPIDER,The time was very long until
2287,THE SPIDER,I had the chance to work my will;
2288,THE SPIDER,"Once seen, the way was clear as light,"
2289,THE SPIDER,A father’s patience infinite.
2290,THE SPIDER,
2291,THE SPIDER,He always was so sensitive;
2292,THE SPIDER,But soon I taught him how to live
2293,THE SPIDER,"With each day, just a patch of white,"
2294,THE SPIDER,"A blinded patch of black, each night."
2295,THE SPIDER,
2296,THE SPIDER,Each day he watched my gaiety.
2297,THE SPIDER,It’s very difficult to die
2298,THE SPIDER,"When one is young.... I pitied him,"
2299,THE SPIDER,"The glass I filled up to the brim,"
2300,THE SPIDER,
2301,THE SPIDER,His shaking fingers scarce could hold;
2302,THE SPIDER,His limbs were trembling as with cold....
2303,THE SPIDER,I waited till from night and day
2304,THE SPIDER,"All meaning I had wiped away,"
2305,THE SPIDER,
2306,THE SPIDER,And then I gave it him again;
2307,THE SPIDER,The wine made heaven in his brain.
2308,THE SPIDER,"Then spider-like, the kindly wine"
2309,THE SPIDER,"Thrust tentacles through every vein,"
2310,THE SPIDER,
2311,THE SPIDER,And knotted him so very fast
2312,THE SPIDER,I knew I had him safe at last.
2313,THE SPIDER,"And sometimes in the dawn, I’d creep"
2314,THE SPIDER,"To watch him as he lay asleep,"
2315,THE SPIDER,
2316,THE SPIDER,"And each time, see my son’s face grown"
2317,THE SPIDER,"In some blurred line, more like my own."
2318,THE SPIDER,"A crumpled rag, he lies all night"
2319,THE SPIDER,Until the first white smear of light;
2320,THE SPIDER,
2321,THE SPIDER,And sleep is but an empty hole ...
2322,THE SPIDER,"No place for him to hide his soul,"
2323,THE SPIDER,No outlet there to set him free:
2324,THE SPIDER,He never can escape from me.
2325,THE SPIDER,
2326,THE SPIDER,"Yet still I never know what thought,"
2327,THE SPIDER,"All fly-like, in his mind lies caught:"
2328,THE SPIDER,His face seems some half-spoken word
2329,THE SPIDER,"Forgot again as soon as heard,"
2330,THE SPIDER,
2331,THE SPIDER,Beneath the livid skin of light;
2332,THE SPIDER,"Oh, just an empty space of white,"
2333,THE SPIDER,Now all the meaning’s gone. I’ll sit

2358,THE DRUNKARD,I think she hardly heard

2367,THE DRUNKARD,"But those lids never stir,"
2368,THE DRUNKARD,

2370,THE DRUNKARD,The hollow of her brain.
2371,THE DRUNKARD,
2372,THE DRUNKARD,"She must have some sly plan, the cheat,"
2373,THE DRUNKARD,To lie so still. The beat

2376,THE DRUNKARD,"With fear to hear me come,"
2377,THE DRUNKARD,
2378,THE DRUNKARD,Now never sounds when I creep nigh.
2379,THE DRUNKARD,Oh! she was always sly.
2380,THE DRUNKARD,
2381,THE DRUNKARD,"And if to spite her, I dared steal"
2382,THE DRUNKARD,"Behind her bed, and feel"
2383,THE DRUNKARD,
2384,THE DRUNKARD,With fumbling fingers for her heart ...
2385,THE DRUNKARD,"Ere I could touch the smart,"
2386,THE DRUNKARD,
2387,THE DRUNKARD,Once more wild shriek on shriek would tear
2388,THE DRUNKARD,The dumb and shuddering air....
2389,THE DRUNKARD,
2390,THE DRUNKARD,And still she never speaks to me.
2391,THE DRUNKARD,She only smiles to see

2415,I,They live to curse us; then they die.
2416,I,
2417,I,"When he was born, it seemed the spring"

2422,I,"His sunlit hair was all my gold,"

2424,I,All heaven was hid within my breast

2429,I,"To steal my child from me, and thrust"
2430,I,The soul I loved down to the dust.
2431,I,
2432,I,"Her hungry, wicked lips were red"
2433,I,As that dark blood my son’s hand shed.
2434,I,"Her eyes were black as Hell’s own night,"
2435,I,Her ice-cold breast was winter-white.
2436,I,
2437,I,I had put by a little gold
2438,I,To bury me when I was cold.
2439,I,"Her fangèd, wanton kiss to buy"
2440,I,My son’s love willed that I should die.
2441,I,
2442,I,The gold was hid beneath my bed;
2443,I,"So little, and my weary head"
2444,I,Was all the guard it had. They lie
2445,I,So quiet and still who soon must die.
2446,I,
2447,I,He stole to kill me while I slept--
2448,I,"The little son, who never wept"
2449,I,But that I kissed his tears away
2450,I,"So fast, his weeping seemed but play."
2451,I,
2452,I,"So light his footfall, yet I heard"
2453,I,"Its echo in my heart, and stirred"
2454,I,From out my weary sleep to see
2455,I,My child’s face bending over me.
2456,I,
2457,I,The wicked knife flashed serpent-wise.--
2458,I,"Yet I saw nothing but his eyes,"
2459,I,And heard one little word he said
2460,I,Go echoing down among the Dead.
2461,I,
2462,I,
2463,II,II
2464,II,
2465,II,They say the Dead may never dream.
2466,II,But yet I heard my pierced heart scream
2467,II,His name within the dark. They lie
2468,II,Who say the Dead can ever die.
2469,II,
2470,II,For in the grave I may not sleep
2471,II,For dreaming that I hear him weep.
2472,II,"And in the dark, my dead hands grope"
2473,II,In search of him. O barren hope!
2474,II,
2475,II,I cannot draw his head to rest
2476,II,Deep down upon my wounded breast ...
2477,II,He gave the breast that fed him well
2478,II,To suckle the small worms of Hell.
2479,II,
2480,II,The little wicked thoughts that fed
2481,II,Upon the weary helpless Dead ...
2482,II,"They whispered o’er my broken heart,"
2483,II,They stuck their fangs deep in the smart.
2484,II,
2485,II,“The child she bore with bloody sweat

2499,II,
2500,II,I tore them from my heart. I said:
2501,II,"“The life-blood that my son’s hand shed,"
2502,II,"That from my broken heart outburst,"
2503,II,"I’d give again, to quench his thirst."
2504,II,
2505,II,“He did no sin. But cold blind earth
