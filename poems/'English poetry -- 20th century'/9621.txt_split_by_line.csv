51,PREFATORY NOTE,thought to show that what for want of a better word is called Peace has
52,PREFATORY NOTE,not interfered with the writing of good poetry.

253,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
254,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The sun drew off at last his piercing fires.
255,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Over the stale warm air, dull as a pond"
256,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"And moveless in the grey quieted street,"
257,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Blue magic of a summer evening glowed.
258,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"The sky, that had been dazzling stone all day,"
259,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Hollowed in smooth hard brightness, now dissolved"
260,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"To infinite soft depth, and smoulder'd down"
261,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Low as the roofs, dark burning blue, and soared"
262,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Clear to that winking drop of liquid silver,"
263,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The first exquisite star. Now the half-light
264,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Tidied away the dusty litter parching
265,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Among the cobbles, veiled in the colour of distance"
266,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Shabby slates and brickwork mouldering, turn'd"
267,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The hunchback houses into patient things
268,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Resting; and golden windows now began.
269,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
270,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"A little brisk grey slattern of a woman,"
271,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Pattering along in her loose-heel'd clogs,"
272,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Pushed the brass-barr'd door of a public-house;
273,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The spring went hard against her; hand and knee
274,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Shoved their weak best. As the door poised ajar,"
275,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Hullabaloo of talking men burst out,"
276,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"A pouring babble of inflamed palaver,"
277,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,And overriding it and shouted down
278,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"High words, jeering or downright, broken like"
279,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Crests that leap and stumble in rushing water.
280,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Just as the door went wide and she stepped in,"
281,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,'She cannot do it!' one was bawling out:
282,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,A glaring hulk of flesh with a bull's voice.
283,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"He finger'd with his neckerchief, and stretched"
284,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"His throat to ease the anger of dispute,"
285,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Then spat to put a full stop to the matter.
286,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
287,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"The little woman waited, with one hand"
288,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Propping the door, and smiled at the loud man."
289,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,They saw her then; and the sight was enough
290,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,To gag the speech of every drinker there:
291,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The din fell down like something chopt off short.
292,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Blank they all wheel'd towards her, with their mouths"
293,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Still gaping as though full of voiceless words.
294,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"She let the door slam to; and all at ease,"
295,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Amused, her smile wrinkling about her eyes,"
296,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Went forward: they made room for her quick enough.
297,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Her chin just topt the counter; she gave in
298,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Her bottle to the potboy, tuckt it back,"
299,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Full of bright tawny ale, under her arm,"
300,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Rapt down the coppers on the planisht zinc,"
301,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,And turned: and no word spoken all the while.
302,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
303,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"The first voice, in that silent crowd, was hers,"
304,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Her light snickering laugh, as she stood there"
305,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Pausing, scanning the sawdust at her feet."
306,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Then she switcht round and faced the positive man
307,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Whose strong 'She cannot do it!' all still felt
308,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Huskily shouting in their guilty ears.
309,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
310,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"'She can't, eh? She can't do it? '--Then she'd heard!"
311,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
312,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"The man, inside his ruddy insolent flesh,"
313,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Had hoped she did not hear. His barrel chest
314,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Gave a slight cringe, as though the glint of her eyes"
315,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Prickt him. But he stood up to her awkwardly bold,"
316,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"One elbow on the counter, gripping his mug"
317,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Like a man holding on to a post for safety.
318,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
319,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
320,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The Man:
321,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
322,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,You can't do what's not nature: nobody can.
323,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
324,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
325,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The Woman:
326,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
327,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,And louts like you have nature in your pocket?
328,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
329,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
330,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The Man:
331,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
332,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,I don't say that--
333,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
334,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
335,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The Woman:
336,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
337,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"If you kept saying naught, No one would guess the fool you are."
338,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
339,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
340,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Second Man:
341,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
342,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Almost
343,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,My very words!
344,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
345,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
346,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The Woman:
347,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
348,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,O you're the knowing man!
349,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The spark among the cinders!
350,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
351,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
352,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,First Man:
353,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
354,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,You can't fetch
355,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"A free man back, unless he wants to come."
356,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
357,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
358,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The Woman:
359,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
360,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Nay, I'll be bound he doesn't want to come!"
361,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
362,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
363,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Third Man:
364,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
365,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,And he won't come: he told me flat he wouldn't.
366,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
367,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
368,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The Woman:
369,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
370,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Are you there too?
371,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
372,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
373,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Third Man:
374,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
375,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,And if he does come back
376,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,It will be devilry brought him.
377,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
378,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
379,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The Woman:
380,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
381,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,I shall bring him;--
382,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Tonight.
383,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
384,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
385,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,First Man:
386,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
387,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,How will he come?
388,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
389,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
390,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The Woman:
391,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
392,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Running: unless
393,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"He's broke his leg, and then he'll have to come"
394,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Crawling: but he will come.
395,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
396,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
397,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,First Man:
398,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
399,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,How do you know
400,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"What he may choose to do, three counties off?"
401,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
402,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
403,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The Woman:
404,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
405,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,He choose?
406,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
407,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
408,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Third Man:
409,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
410,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,You haven't got him on a lead.
411,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
412,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
413,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The Woman:
414,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
415,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Haven't I though!
416,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
417,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
418,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Second Man:
419,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
420,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,That's right; it's what I said.
421,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
422,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
423,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The Woman:
424,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
425,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Ay, there are brains in your family."
426,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
427,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
428,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,First Man:
429,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
430,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,You have
431,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Some sort of pull on him, to draw him home?"
432,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
433,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
434,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The Woman:
435,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
436,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,You may say that: I have hold of his mind.
437,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,And I can slack it off or fetch it taut.
438,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,And make him dance a score of miles away
439,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,An answer to the least twangling thrum
440,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,I play on it. He thought he lurkt at last
441,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Safely; and all the while, what has he been?"
442,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,An eel on the end of a night line; and it's time
443,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"I haul'd him in. You'll see, to-night I'll land him."
444,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
445,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
446,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Third Man:
447,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
448,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Bragging's a light job.

453,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,You daren't let me take
454,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Your eyes in mine!--Haul, did I say? no need:"
455,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"I give his mind a twitch, and up he comes"
456,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Tumbling home to me. Whatever work he's at,"
457,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,He drops the thing he holds like redhot iron
458,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,And runs--runs till he falls down like a beast
459,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Pole-axt, and grunts for breath; then up and on,"
460,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,No matter does he know the road or not:
461,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The strain I put on his mind will keep him going
462,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Right as a homing-pigeon.
463,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
464,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
465,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,First Man:

467,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Devilry I call it.

469,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
470,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The Woman:
471,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
472,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,And you're welcome.
473,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
474,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
475,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Second Man:
476,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
477,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,But the law should have a say here.
478,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
479,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
480,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The Woman:
481,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
482,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"What, isn't he mine,"
483,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,My own? There's naught but what I please about it.

486,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Third Man:
487,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
488,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Why did you let him go?
489,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
490,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
491,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The Woman:
492,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
493,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,To fetch him back!
494,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"For I enjoy this, mind. There's many a one"
495,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Would think, to see me, There goes misery!"
496,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,There's a queer starveling for you!--and I do
497,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"A thing that makes me like a saint in glory,"
498,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The life of me the sound of a great tune
499,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Your flesh could never hear: I can send power
500,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Delighting out of me! O, the mere thought"
501,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Has made my blood go smarting in my veins,"
502,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Such a flame glowing along it!--And all the same
503,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,I'll pay him out for sidling off from me.
504,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,But I'll have supper first.
505,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
506,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
507,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"When she was gone,"
508,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Their talk could scarcely raise itself again
509,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Above a grumble. But at last a cry
510,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Sharp-pitcht came startling in from the street: at once
511,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Their moody talk exploded into flare
512,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Of swearing hubbub, like gunpowder dropt"
513,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"On embers; mugs were clapt down, out they bolted"
514,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Rowdily jostling, eager for the event."
515,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
516,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"All down the street the folk throng'd out of doors,"
517,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,But left a narrow track clear in the middle;
518,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"And there a man came running, a tall man"
519,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Running desperately and slowly, pounding"
520,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Like a machine, so evenly, so blindly;"
521,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,And regularly his trotting body wagg'd.
522,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Only one foot clatter'd upon the stones;
523,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The other padded in his dogged stride:
524,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"The boot was gone, the sock hung frayed in shreds"
525,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"About his ankle, the foot was blood and earth;"
526,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"And never a limp, not the least flinch, to tell"
527,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,The wounded pulp hit stone at every step.
528,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"His clothes were tatter'd and his rent skin showed,"
529,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Harrowed with thorns. His face was pale as putty,"
530,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Thrown far back; clots of drooping spittle foamed
531,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"On his moustache, and his hair hung in tails,"
532,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,Mired with sweat; and sightless in their sockets
533,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"His eyeballs turned up white, as dull as pebbles."
534,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Evenly and doggedly he trotted,"
535,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,And as he went he moaned. Then out of sight
536,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"Round a corner he swerved, and out of hearing."
537,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,
538,WITCHCRAFT: NEW STYLE,"--'The law should have a say to that, by God!'"

557,LITTLEHOLME,
558,LITTLEHOLME,
559,LITTLEHOLME,"In entering the town, where the bright river"
560,LITTLEHOLME,"Shrinks in its white stone bed, old thoughts return"
561,LITTLEHOLME,Of how a quiet queen was nurtured here
562,LITTLEHOLME,"In the pale, shadowed ruin on the height;"
563,LITTLEHOLME,"Of how, when the hoar town was new and clean"
564,LITTLEHOLME,And had not grown a part of the gaunt fells
565,LITTLEHOLME,"That peered down into it, the burghers wove"
566,LITTLEHOLME,"On their small, fireside looms green, famous webs"
567,LITTLEHOLME,"To cling on lissome, tower-dwelling ladies"
568,LITTLEHOLME,"Who rode the hills swaying like green saplings,"
569,LITTLEHOLME,"Or mask tall, hardy outlaws from pursuit"
570,LITTLEHOLME,"Down beechen caverns and green under-lights,"
571,LITTLEHOLME,"(The rude, vain looms are gone, their beams are broken;"
572,LITTLEHOLME,"Their webs are now not seen, but memory"
573,LITTLEHOLME,Still tangles in their mesh the dews they swept
574,LITTLEHOLME,"Like ruby sparks, the lights they took, the scents"
575,LITTLEHOLME,"They held, the movement of their shapes and shades);"
576,LITTLEHOLME,Of how the Border burners in cold dawns
577,LITTLEHOLME,Of Summer hurried North up the high vales
578,LITTLEHOLME,Past smoking farmsteads that had lit the night
579,LITTLEHOLME,And surf of crowding cattle; and of how
580,LITTLEHOLME,"A laughing prince of cursed, impossible hopes"
581,LITTLEHOLME,Rode through the little streets Northward to battle
582,LITTLEHOLME,"And to defeat, to be a fading thought,"
583,LITTLEHOLME,Belated in dead mountains of romance.

585,LITTLEHOLME,A carver at his bench in a high gable
586,LITTLEHOLME,"Hears the sharp stream close under, far below"
587,LITTLEHOLME,"Tinkle and rustle, and no other sound"
588,LITTLEHOLME,Arises there to him to change his thoughts
589,LITTLEHOLME,"Of the changed, silent town and the dead hands"
590,LITTLEHOLME,"That made it and maintained it, and the need"
591,LITTLEHOLME,For handiwork and happy work and work
592,LITTLEHOLME,To use and ease the mind if such sweet towns
593,LITTLEHOLME,Are to be built again or live again.
594,LITTLEHOLME,
595,LITTLEHOLME,"The long town ends at Littleholme, where the road"
596,LITTLEHOLME,Creeps up to hills of ancient-looking stone.
597,LITTLEHOLME,Under the hanging eaves at Littleholme
598,LITTLEHOLME,A latticed casement peeps above still gardens
599,LITTLEHOLME,Into a crown of druid-solemn trees
600,LITTLEHOLME,"Upon a knoll as high as a small house,"
601,LITTLEHOLME,A shapely mound made so by nameless men
602,LITTLEHOLME,Whose smoothing touch yet shows through the green hide.
603,LITTLEHOLME,When the slow moonlight drips from leaf to leaf
604,LITTLEHOLME,"Of that sharp, plumy gloom, and the hour comes"
605,LITTLEHOLME,"When something seems awaited, though unknown,"
606,LITTLEHOLME,There should appear between those leaf-thatched piles
607,LITTLEHOLME,"Fresh, long-limbed women striding easily,"
608,LITTLEHOLME,And men whose hair-plaits swing with their shagged arms;
609,LITTLEHOLME,"Returning in that equal, echoed light"
610,LITTLEHOLME,Which does not measure time to the dear garths
611,LITTLEHOLME,That were their own when from white Norway coasts
612,LITTLEHOLME,"They landed on a kind, not distant shore,"
613,LITTLEHOLME,"And to the place where they have left their clothing,"
614,LITTLEHOLME,Their long-accustomed bones and hair and beds
615,LITTLEHOLME,"That once were pleasant to them, in that barrow"
616,LITTLEHOLME,Their vanished children heaped above them dead:
617,LITTLEHOLME,For in the soundless stillness of hot noon
618,LITTLEHOLME,"The mind of man, noticeable in that knoll,"
619,LITTLEHOLME,Enhances its dark presence with a life
620,LITTLEHOLME,More vivid and more actual than the life
621,LITTLEHOLME,Of self-sown trees and untouched earth. It is seen
622,LITTLEHOLME,What aspect this land had in those first eyes:
623,LITTLEHOLME,In that regard the works of later men
624,LITTLEHOLME,"Fall in and sink like lime when it is slaked,"
625,LITTLEHOLME,"Staid, youthful queen and weavers are unborn,"
626,LITTLEHOLME,And the new crags the Northmen saw are set
627,LITTLEHOLME,About an earth that has not been misused.

646,INVOCATION,"For when I hear thy distant footfall nearing,"
647,INVOCATION,"And wait on thy appearing,"
648,INVOCATION,Lo! my lips are silent: no words come to me.
649,INVOCATION,
650,INVOCATION,"Once I waylaid thee in green forest covers,"
651,INVOCATION,Hoping that spring might free my lips with gentle fingers;
652,INVOCATION,Alas! her presence lingers
653,INVOCATION,No longer than on the plain the shadow of brown kestrel hovers.
654,INVOCATION,
655,INVOCATION,Through windless ways of the night my spirit followed after;
656,INVOCATION,"Cold and remote were they, and there, possessed"
657,INVOCATION,"By a strange unworldly rest,"
658,INVOCATION,Awaiting thy still voice heard only starry laughter.
659,INVOCATION,
660,INVOCATION,The pillared halls of sleep echoed my ghostly tread.
661,INVOCATION,Yet when their secret chambers I essayed
662,INVOCATION,"My spirit sank, dismayed,"
663,INVOCATION,Waking in fear to find the new-born vision fled.
664,INVOCATION,
665,INVOCATION,Once indeed--but then my spirit bloomed in leafy rapture--
666,INVOCATION,I loved; and once I looked death in the eyes:
667,INVOCATION,"So, suddenly made wise,"
668,INVOCATION,Spoke of such beauty as I may never recapture....
669,INVOCATION,
670,INVOCATION,"Whither, O, divine mistress, must I then follow thee?"
671,INVOCATION,"Is it only in love ... say, is it only in death"

679,PROTHALAMION,When the evening came my love said to me:
680,PROTHALAMION,Let us go into the garden now that the sky is cool;
681,PROTHALAMION,"The garden of black hellebore and rosemary,"
682,PROTHALAMION,Where wild woodruff spills in a milky pool.
683,PROTHALAMION,
684,PROTHALAMION,"Low we passed in the twilight, for the wavering heat"
685,PROTHALAMION,Of day had waned; and round that shaded plot
686,PROTHALAMION,Of secret beauty the thickets clustered sweet:
687,PROTHALAMION,"Here is heaven, our hearts whispered, but our lips spake not."
688,PROTHALAMION,
689,PROTHALAMION,Between that old garden and seas of lazy foam
690,PROTHALAMION,Gloomy and beautiful alleys of trees arise
691,PROTHALAMION,"With spire of cypress and dreamy beechen dome,"
692,PROTHALAMION,So dark that our enchanted sight knew nothing but the skies:
693,PROTHALAMION,
694,PROTHALAMION,"Veiled with a soft air, drench'd in the roses' musk"
695,PROTHALAMION,"Or the dusky, dark carnation's breath of clove:"
696,PROTHALAMION,"No stars burned in their deeps, but through the dusk"
697,PROTHALAMION,"I saw my love's eyes, and they were brimmed with love."
698,PROTHALAMION,
699,PROTHALAMION,"No star their secret ravished, no wasting moon"
700,PROTHALAMION,Mocked the sad transience of those eternal hours:
701,PROTHALAMION,"Only the soft, unseeing heaven of June,"
702,PROTHALAMION,"The ghosts of great trees, and the sleeping flowers."
703,PROTHALAMION,
704,PROTHALAMION,For doves that crooned in the leafy noonday now
705,PROTHALAMION,"Were silent; the night-jar sought his secret covers,"
706,PROTHALAMION,Nor even a mild sea-whisper moved a creaking bough--
707,PROTHALAMION,Was ever a silence deeper made for lovers?
708,PROTHALAMION,
709,PROTHALAMION,Was ever a moment meeter made for love?
710,PROTHALAMION,Beautiful are your closed lips beneath my kiss;
711,PROTHALAMION,And all your yielding sweetness beautiful--
712,PROTHALAMION,"Oh, never in all the world was such a night as this!"

757,LOCHANILAUN,"Cool rain upon the reed-beds, or the wake"

776,LETTERMORE,
777,LETTERMORE,"And men who starve on Lettermore,"
778,LETTERMORE,"Cursing the haggard, hungry surf,"
779,LETTERMORE,Will souse the autumn's bruiséd grains
780,LETTERMORE,To light dark fires within their brains
781,LETTERMORE,And fight with stones on Lettermore
782,LETTERMORE,Or sprawl beside the smoky turf.
783,LETTERMORE,
784,LETTERMORE,When spring blows over Lettermore
785,LETTERMORE,"To bloom the ragged furze with gold,"
786,LETTERMORE,The lovely south wind's living breath

788,LETTERMORE,For fever breeds on Lettermore
789,LETTERMORE,To waste the eyes of young and old.
790,LETTERMORE,
791,LETTERMORE,A black van comes to Lettermore;
792,LETTERMORE,"The horses stumble on the stones,"
793,LETTERMORE,"The drivers curse,--for it is hard"
794,LETTERMORE,To cross the hills from Oughterard
795,LETTERMORE,And cart the sick from Lettermore:
796,LETTERMORE,A stinking load of rags and bones.
797,LETTERMORE,
798,LETTERMORE,But you will go to Lettermore
799,LETTERMORE,"When white sea-trout are on the run,"
800,LETTERMORE,When purple glows between the rocks
801,LETTERMORE,About Lord Dudley's fishing box
802,LETTERMORE,"Adown the road to Lettermore,"
803,LETTERMORE,And wide seas tarnish in the sun.
804,LETTERMORE,

807,LETTERMORE,With peasant lovers in a blue

836,THE LEANING ELM,Huddled a mournful wood:
837,THE LEANING ELM,"Smooth pillars of beech, domed chestnut, sycamore,"
838,THE LEANING ELM,In stony sleep they stood:
839,THE LEANING ELM,"But you, unhappy elm, the angry west"
840,THE LEANING ELM,"Had chosen from the rest,"
841,THE LEANING ELM,"Flung broken on your brothers' branches bare,"
842,THE LEANING ELM,And left you leaning there
843,THE LEANING ELM,So dead that when the breath of winter cast
844,THE LEANING ELM,"Wild snow upon the blast,"
845,THE LEANING ELM,"The other living branches, downward bowed,"
846,THE LEANING ELM,Shook free their crystal shroud
847,THE LEANING ELM,And shed upon your blackened trunk beneath
848,THE LEANING ELM,Their livery of death....
849,THE LEANING ELM,
850,THE LEANING ELM,On windless nights between the beechen bars
851,THE LEANING ELM,I watched cold stars
852,THE LEANING ELM,"Throb whitely in the sky, and dreamily"
853,THE LEANING ELM,Wondered if any life lay locked in thee:
854,THE LEANING ELM,If still the hidden sap secretly moved
855,THE LEANING ELM,As water in the icy winterbourne
856,THE LEANING ELM,Floweth unheard:
857,THE LEANING ELM,And half I pitied you your trance forlorn:
858,THE LEANING ELM,"You could not hear, I thought, the voice of any bird,"
859,THE LEANING ELM,The shadowy cries of bats in dim twilight
860,THE LEANING ELM,Or cool voices of owls crying by night ...
861,THE LEANING ELM,Hunting by night under the hornéd moon:
862,THE LEANING ELM,"Yet half I envied you your wintry swoon,"
863,THE LEANING ELM,"Till, on this morning mild, the sun, new-risen"
864,THE LEANING ELM,Steals from his misty prison;
865,THE LEANING ELM,"The frozen fallows glow, the black trees shaken"
866,THE LEANING ELM,In a clear flood of sunlight vibrating awaken:
867,THE LEANING ELM,"And lo, your ravaged bole, beyond belief"
868,THE LEANING ELM,Slenderly fledged anew with tender leaf
869,THE LEANING ELM,As pale as those twin vanes that break at last
870,THE LEANING ELM,In a tiny fan above the black beech-mast
871,THE LEANING ELM,Where no blade springeth green
872,THE LEANING ELM,But pallid bells of the shy helleborine.
873,THE LEANING ELM,What is this ecstasy that overwhelms
874,THE LEANING ELM,"The dreaming earth? See, the embrownéd elms"
875,THE LEANING ELM,Crowding purple distances warm the depths of the wood:
876,THE LEANING ELM,"A new-born wind tosses their tassels brown,"
877,THE LEANING ELM,His white clouds dapple the down:
878,THE LEANING ELM,Into a green flame bursting the hedgerows stand.

2800,THE SPRIG OF LIME,
2801,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"He lay, and those who watched him were amazed"
2802,THE SPRIG OF LIME,To see unheralded beneath the lids
2803,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Twin tears, new-gathered at the price of pain,"
2804,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Start and at once run crookedly athwart
2805,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Cheeks channelled long by pain, never by tears."
2806,THE SPRIG OF LIME,So desolate too the sigh next uttered
2807,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"They had wept also, but his great lips moved,"
2808,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"And bending down one heard, 'A sprig of lime;"
2809,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Bring me a sprig of lime.' Whereat she stole
2810,THE SPRIG OF LIME,With dumb signs forth to pluck the thing he craved.
2811,THE SPRIG OF LIME,
2812,THE SPRIG OF LIME,So lay he till a lime-twig had been snapped
2813,THE SPRIG OF LIME,From some still branch that swept the outer grass
2814,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Far from the silver pillar of the bole
2815,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Which mounting past the house's crusted roof
2816,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Split into massy limbs, crossed boughs, a maze"
2817,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Of close-compacted intercontorted staffs
2818,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Bowered in foliage wherethrough the sun
2819,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Shot sudden showers of light or crystal spars
2820,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Or wavered in a green and vitreous flood.
2821,THE SPRIG OF LIME,And all the while in faint and fainter tones
2822,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Scarce audible on deepened evening's hush
2823,THE SPRIG OF LIME,He framed his curious and last request
2824,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"For 'lime, a sprig of lime.' Her trembling hand"
2825,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Closed his loose fingers on the awkward stem
2826,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Covered above with gentle heart-shaped leaves
2827,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"And under dangling, pale as honey-wax,"
2828,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Square clusters of sweet-scented starry flowers.
2829,THE SPRIG OF LIME,
2830,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"She laid his bent arm back upon his breast,"
2831,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Then watched above white knuckles clenched in prayer.
2832,THE SPRIG OF LIME,
2833,THE SPRIG OF LIME,He never moved. Only at last his eyes
2834,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Opened, then brightened in such avid gaze"
2835,THE SPRIG OF LIME,She feared the coma mastered him again ...
2836,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"But no; strange sobs rose chuckling in his throat,"
2837,THE SPRIG OF LIME,A stranger ecstasy suffused the flesh
2838,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Of that just mask so sun-dried, gouged and old"
2839,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Which few--too few!--had loved, too many feared."
2840,THE SPRIG OF LIME,'Father!' she cried; 'Father!'
2841,THE SPRIG OF LIME,He did not hear.
2842,THE SPRIG OF LIME,
2843,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"She knelt and kneeling drank the scent of limes,"
2844,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Blown round the slow blind by a vesperal gust,"
2845,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Till the room swam. So the lime-incense blew
2846,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Into her life as once it had in his,"
2847,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Though how and when and with what ageless charge
2848,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Of sorrow and deep joy how could she know?
2849,THE SPRIG OF LIME,
2850,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Sweet lime that often at the height of noon
2851,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Diffusing dizzy fragrance from your boughs,"
2852,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Tasselled with blossoms more innumerable
2853,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Than the black bees, the uproar of whose toil"
2854,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Filled your green vaults, winning such metheglyn"
2855,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"As clouds their sappy cells, distil, as once"
2856,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Ye used, your sunniest emanations"
2857,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Toward the window where a woman kneels--
2858,THE SPRIG OF LIME,She who within that room in childish hours
2859,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Lay through the lasting murmur of blanch'd noon
2860,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Behind the sultry blind, now full now flat,"
2861,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Drinking anew of every odorous breath,"
2862,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Supremely happy in her ignorance
2863,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Of Time that hastens hourly and of Death
2864,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Who need not haste. Scatter your fumes, O lime,"
2865,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Loose from each hispid star of citron bloom,"
2866,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Tangled beneath the labyrinthine boughs,"
2867,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Cloud on such stinging cloud of exhalations
2868,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"As reek of youth, fierce life and summer's prime,"
2869,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Though hardly now shall he in that dusk room
2870,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Savour your sweetness, since the very sprig,"
2871,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Profuse of blossom and of essences,"
2872,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"He smells not, who in a paltering hand"
2873,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Clasps it laid close his peaked and gleaming face
2874,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Propped in the pillow. Breathe silent, lofty lime,"
2875,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Your curfew secrets out in fervid scent
2876,THE SPRIG OF LIME,To the attendant shadows! Tinge the air
2877,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Of the midsummer night that now begins,"
2878,THE SPRIG OF LIME,At an owl's oaring flight from dusk to dusk
2879,THE SPRIG OF LIME,And downward caper of the giddy bat
2880,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Hawking against the lustre of bare skies,"
2881,THE SPRIG OF LIME,With something of th' unfathomable bliss
2882,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"He, who lies dying there, knew once of old"
2883,THE SPRIG OF LIME,In the serene trance of a summer night
2884,THE SPRIG OF LIME,When with th' abundance of his young bride's hair
2885,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Loosed on his breast he lay and dared not sleep,"
2886,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Listening for the scarce motion of your boughs,"
2887,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Which sighed with bliss as she with blissful sleep,"
2888,THE SPRIG OF LIME,And drinking desperately each honied wave
2889,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Of perfume wafted past the ghostly blind
2890,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Knew first th' implacable and bitter sense
2891,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Of Time that hastes and Death who need not haste.
2892,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Shed your last sweetness, limes!"
2893,THE SPRIG OF LIME,But now no more.
2894,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"She, fruit of that night's love, she heeds you not,"
2895,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Who bent, compassionate, to the dim floor"
2896,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Takes up the sprig of lime and presses it
2897,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"In pain against the stumbling of her heart,"
2898,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Knowing, untold, he cannot need it now."

2905,SEVENTEEN,
2906,SEVENTEEN,"All the loud winds were in the garden wood,"
2907,SEVENTEEN,All shadows joyfuller than lissom hounds
2908,SEVENTEEN,"Doubled in chasing, all exultant clouds"
2909,SEVENTEEN,That ever flung fierce mist and eddying fire
2910,SEVENTEEN,Across heavens deeper than blue polar seas
2911,SEVENTEEN,"Fled over the sceptre-spikes of the chestnuts,"
2912,SEVENTEEN,Over the speckle of the wych-elms' green.
2913,SEVENTEEN,"She shouted; then stood still, hushed and abashed"
2914,SEVENTEEN,"To hear her voice so shrill in that gay roar,"
2915,SEVENTEEN,"And suddenly her eyelashes were dimmed,"
2916,SEVENTEEN,Caught in tense tears of spiritual joy;
2917,SEVENTEEN,For there were daffodils which sprightly shook
2918,SEVENTEEN,"Ten thousand ruffling heads throughout the wood,"
2919,SEVENTEEN,And every flower of those delighting flowers
2920,SEVENTEEN,"Laughed, nodding to her, till she clapped her hands"
2921,SEVENTEEN,"Crying 'O daffies, could you only speak!'"
2922,SEVENTEEN,
2923,SEVENTEEN,But there was more. A jay with skyblue shaft
2924,SEVENTEEN,"Set in blunt wing, skimmed screaming on ahead."
2925,SEVENTEEN,She followed him. A murrey squirrel eyed
2926,SEVENTEEN,"Her warily, cocked upon tail-plumed haunch,"
2927,SEVENTEEN,"Then, skipping the whirligig of last-year leaves,"
2928,SEVENTEEN,Whisked himself out of sight and reappeared
2929,SEVENTEEN,Leering about the hole of a young beech;
2930,SEVENTEEN,And every time she thought to corner him
2931,SEVENTEEN,He scrambled round on little scratchy hands
2932,SEVENTEEN,To peek at her about the other side.
2933,SEVENTEEN,"She lost him, bolting branch to branch, at last--"
2934,SEVENTEEN,The impudent brat! But still high overhead
2935,SEVENTEEN,"Flight on exuberant flight of opal scud,"
2936,SEVENTEEN,"Or of dissolving mist, florid as flame."
2937,SEVENTEEN,
2938,SEVENTEEN,Scattered in ecstasy over the blue. And she
2939,SEVENTEEN,"Followed, first walking, giving her bright locks"
2940,SEVENTEEN,"To the cold fervour of the springtime gale,"
2941,SEVENTEEN,Whose rush bore the cloud shadow past the cloud
2942,SEVENTEEN,Over the irised wastes of emerald turf.
2943,SEVENTEEN,"And still the huge wind volleyed. Save the gulls,"
2944,SEVENTEEN,Goldenly in the sunny blast careering
2945,SEVENTEEN,"Or on blue-shadowed underwing at plunge,"
2946,SEVENTEEN,None shared with her who now could not but run
2947,SEVENTEEN,The splendour and tumult of th' onrushing spring.
2948,SEVENTEEN,
2949,SEVENTEEN,And now she ran no more: the gale gave plumes.
2950,SEVENTEEN,"One with the shadows whirled along the grass,"
2951,SEVENTEEN,"One with the onward smother of veering gulls,"
2952,SEVENTEEN,"One with the pursuit of cloud after cloud,"
2953,SEVENTEEN,Swept she. Pure speed coursed in immortal limbs;
2954,SEVENTEEN,Nostrils drank as from wells of unknown air;
2955,SEVENTEEN,Ears received the smooth silence of racing floods;
2956,SEVENTEEN,Light as of glassy suns froze in her eyes;
2957,SEVENTEEN,Space was given her and she ruled all space.
2958,SEVENTEEN,
2959,SEVENTEEN,"Spring, author of twifold loveliness,"
2960,SEVENTEEN,"Who flittest in the mirth of the wild folk,"
2961,SEVENTEEN,"Profferest greeting in the faces of flowers,"
2962,SEVENTEEN,"Blowest in the firmamental glory,"
2963,SEVENTEEN,Renewest in the heart of the sad human
2964,SEVENTEEN,"All faiths, guard thou the innocent spirit"
2965,SEVENTEEN,Into whose unknowing hands this noontide
2966,SEVENTEEN,"Thou pourest treasure, yet scarce recognised,"
2967,SEVENTEEN,"That unashamed before man's glib wisdom,"
2968,SEVENTEEN,"Unabashed beneath the wrath of chance,"
2969,SEVENTEEN,She accept in simplicity of homage
2970,SEVENTEEN,"The hidden holiness, the created emblem"
2971,SEVENTEEN,"To be in her, until death shall take her,"
2972,SEVENTEEN,The source and secret of eternal spring.

3365,A NIGHT-PIECE,Come out and walk. The last few drops of light
3366,A NIGHT-PIECE,Drain silently out of the cloudy blue;
3367,A NIGHT-PIECE,"The trees are full of the dark-stooping night,"
3368,A NIGHT-PIECE,The fields are wet with dew.
3369,A NIGHT-PIECE,
3370,A NIGHT-PIECE,"All's quiet in the wood but, far away,"
3371,A NIGHT-PIECE,"Down the hillside and out across the plain,"
3372,A NIGHT-PIECE,"Moves, with long trail of white that marks its way,"
3373,A NIGHT-PIECE,The softly panting train.
3374,A NIGHT-PIECE,
3375,A NIGHT-PIECE,Come through the clearing. Hardly now we see
3376,A NIGHT-PIECE,"The flowers, save dark or light against the grass,"
3377,A NIGHT-PIECE,Or glimmering silver on a scented tree
3378,A NIGHT-PIECE,That trembles as we pass.
3379,A NIGHT-PIECE,
3380,A NIGHT-PIECE,"Hark now! So far, so far ... that distant song ..."
3381,A NIGHT-PIECE,Move not the rustling grasses with your feet.
3382,A NIGHT-PIECE,"The dusk is full of sounds, that all along"
3383,A NIGHT-PIECE,The muttering boughs repeat.
3384,A NIGHT-PIECE,
3385,A NIGHT-PIECE,"So far, so faint, we lift our heads in doubt."
3386,A NIGHT-PIECE,"Wind, or the blood that beats within our ears,"
3387,A NIGHT-PIECE,"Has feigned a dubious and delusive note,"
3388,A NIGHT-PIECE,Such as a dreamer hears.
3389,A NIGHT-PIECE,
3390,A NIGHT-PIECE,Again ... again! The faint sounds rise and fail.
3391,A NIGHT-PIECE,"So far the enchanted tree, the song so low..."
3392,A NIGHT-PIECE,A drowsy thrush? A waking nightingale?
3393,A NIGHT-PIECE,Silence. We do not know.

3400,IN ABSENCE,"For now I need you most, since I have gone"
3401,IN ABSENCE,"Through the sparse woodland in the fading light,"
3402,IN ABSENCE,"Where in time past we two have walked alone,"
3403,IN ABSENCE,"Heard the loud nightjar spin his pleasant note,"
3404,IN ABSENCE,"And seen the wild rose folded up for sleep,"
3405,IN ABSENCE,"And whispered, though the soft word choked my throat,"
3406,IN ABSENCE,Your dear name out across the valley deep.
3407,IN ABSENCE,"Be near to me, for now I need you most."
3408,IN ABSENCE,To-night I saw an unsubstantial flame
3409,IN ABSENCE,"Flickering along those shadowy paths, a ghost"
3410,IN ABSENCE,"That turned to me and answered to your name,"
3411,IN ABSENCE,Mocking me with a wraith of far delight.
3412,IN ABSENCE,"... My lovely one, be near to me to-night."

3419,THE GLOW-WORM,"And beside it on the rough grass that the wind invisibly stirs,"
3420,THE GLOW-WORM,"Sheltered by sharp-speared gorse and the berried junipers,"
3421,THE GLOW-WORM,"Shining steadily with a green light, the glow-worm lies."
3422,THE GLOW-WORM,
3423,THE GLOW-WORM,We regard it; and this hill and all the other hills
3424,THE GLOW-WORM,"That fall in folds to the river, very smooth and steep,"
3425,THE GLOW-WORM,And the hangers and brakes that the darkness thickly fills
3426,THE GLOW-WORM,"Fade like phantoms round the light, and night is deep, so deep,--"
3427,THE GLOW-WORM,
3428,THE GLOW-WORM,"That all the world is emptiness about the still flame,"
3429,THE GLOW-WORM,And we are small shadows standing lost in the huge night.
3430,THE GLOW-WORM,"We gather up the glow-worm, stooping with dazzled sight,"
3431,THE GLOW-WORM,"And carry it to the little enclosed garden whence we came,"
3432,THE GLOW-WORM,
3433,THE GLOW-WORM,"And place it on the short grass. Then the shadowy flowers fade,"
3434,THE GLOW-WORM,The walls waver and melt and the houses disappear
3435,THE GLOW-WORM,And the solid town trembles into insubstantial shade
3436,THE GLOW-WORM,"Round the light of the burning glow-worm, steady and clear."

3443,THE CATACLYSM,"And throws the bottom waters to the sky,"
3444,THE CATACLYSM,"Strange apparitions on the surface lie,"
3445,THE CATACLYSM,"Great battered vessels, stripped of gloss and gold,"
3446,THE CATACLYSM,"And, writhing in their pain, sea-monsters old,"
3447,THE CATACLYSM,"Who stain the waters with a bloody dye,"
3448,THE CATACLYSM,With unaccustomed mouths bellow and cry
3449,THE CATACLYSM,And vex the waves with struggling fin and fold.
3450,THE CATACLYSM,
3451,THE CATACLYSM,And with these too come little trivial things
3452,THE CATACLYSM,Tossed from the deeps by the same casual hand;
3453,THE CATACLYSM,"A faint sea flower, dragged from the lowest sand,"
3454,THE CATACLYSM,That will not undulate its luminous wings
3455,THE CATACLYSM,"In the slow tides again, lies dead and swings"
3456,THE CATACLYSM,Along the muddy ripples to the land.

3470,A HOLLOW ELM,Upon thy sunny mound;
3471,A HOLLOW ELM,The first spring breezes flow
3472,A HOLLOW ELM,Past with sweet dizzy sound;
3473,A HOLLOW ELM,Yet on thy pollard top the branches few
3474,A HOLLOW ELM,"Stand stiffly out, disdain to murmur too."
3475,A HOLLOW ELM,
3476,A HOLLOW ELM,The children at thy foot

3483,A HOLLOW ELM,These at the beck of spring
3484,A HOLLOW ELM,Live in the moment still:
3485,A HOLLOW ELM,"Thy boughs unquivering,"
3486,A HOLLOW ELM,"Remembering winter's chill,"
3487,A HOLLOW ELM,"And many other winters past and gone,"

3490,A HOLLOW ELM,"Hast thou so much withstood,"
3491,A HOLLOW ELM,"Tempest-despising tree,"
3492,A HOLLOW ELM,That now thy hollow wood
3493,A HOLLOW ELM,Stiffens disdainfully
3494,A HOLLOW ELM,"Against the soft spring airs and soft spring rain,"
3495,A HOLLOW ELM,Knowing too well that winter comes again?

3525,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"The young girls gather round her,"

3528,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Subtler in her moving heart than sun-motes that vary

3546,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Glistening hair, have fired the dull beholder,"
3547,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Or telling Anais
3548,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,That faint indifference ere now hath bred a kiss

3560,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,And Celia leans aside
3561,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,To contemplate her black-silked ankle on the grass;
3562,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"In remote dreaming pride,"
3563,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Rosalind recalls the image in her glass;
3564,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Phillis through all her body feels
3565,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"How divine energy steals,"

3575,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"But opens her red lips, yawning drowsily,"

3577,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Dimpling the round chin beneath,"

3579,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,
3580,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"And still the lesson goes on,"
3581,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,For this is an old story that is never done;
3582,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"And now the precept is of ribbon and shoe,"
3583,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"What with linens and silks love finds to do,"
3584,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,And how man's heart is tangled in a string
3585,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Or taken in gauze like a weak and helpless thing.
3586,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Chloe falls asleep; and the long summer day
3587,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Drifts slowly past the girls and the warm roses,"
3588,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Giving in dreams its hours away.
3589,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Now Stella throws her head back, and Phillis disposes"
3590,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Her strong brown hands quietly in her lap,"
3591,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,And Rose's slender feet grow restless and tap
3592,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,The turf to an imaginary tune.
3593,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Now all this grace of youthful bodies and faces
3594,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Is wrought to a glow by the golden weather of June;
3595,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Now, Love, completing grace of all the graces,"
3596,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Strong in these hearts thy pure streams rise,"
3597,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Transmuting what they learn by heavenly alchemies.
3598,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Swift from the listeners the spell vanishes,"
3599,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"And through the tinkling, empty words,"
3600,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"True thoughts of true love press,"
3601,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Flying and wheeling nearer;
3602,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,As through a sunny sky a flock of birds
3603,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Against the throbbing blue grows clearer and clearer,"
3604,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,So closer come these thoughts and dearer.
3605,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,
3606,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Helen rises with a laugh;
3607,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Chloe wakes;
3608,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,All the enchantment scatters off like chaff;
3609,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,The cord is loosened and the spell breaks.
3610,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Rosalind
3611,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Resolves that to-night she will be kind to her lover,"
3612,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Unreflecting, warm and kind."
3613,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Celia tells the lessons over,"
3614,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Counting on her fingers--one and two ...
3615,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Ribbon and shoe,"
3616,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Skirts, flowers, song, dancing, laughter, eyes ..."
3617,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Through the whole catalogue of formal gallantry
3618,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"And studious coquetries,"
3619,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Counting to herself maliciously.
3620,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,
3621,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"But the old, the fading shepherdess, Aristonoë,"
3622,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Rises stiffly and walks alone
3623,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Down the broad path where densely the laurels grow,"
3624,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"And over a little lawn, not closely mown,"
3625,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Where wave the flowering grass and the rich meadowsweet.
3626,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"She seems to walk painfully now and slow,"
3627,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,And drags a little on her high-heeled feet.
3628,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,She stops at last below
3629,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"An old and twisted plum-tree, whose last petal is gone,"
3630,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Leans on the comfortable, rugged bole,"
3631,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,And stares through the green leaves at the drooping sun.
3632,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,The tree and the warm light comfort her ageing soul.
3633,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,
3634,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"On the other lawn behind her, out of sight,"
3635,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,The girls at play
3636,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Drive out melancholy by lively delight,"
3637,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,And the wind carries their songs and laughter away.
3638,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Some begin dancing and seriously tread
3639,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"A modern measure up and down the grass,"
3640,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Turn, slide with bending knees, and pass"
3641,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"With dipping hand and poising head,"
3642,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Float through the sun in pairs, like newly shed"
3643,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,And golden leaves astray
3644,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Upon the warm wind of an autumn day,"
3645,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,When the Indian summer rules the air.
3646,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Others, having found,"
3647,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Lying idly on the sun-hot ground,"
3648,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Shuttlecocks and battledores,"
3649,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Play with the buoyant feathers and stare
3650,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Dazzled at the plaything as it soars,"
3651,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Vague against the shining sky,"
3652,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Where light yet throbs and confuses the eye,"
3653,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Then see it again, white and clear,"
3654,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"As slowly, poisèdly it falls by"
3655,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,The dark green foliage and floats near.
3656,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"But Celia, apart, is pensive and must sigh,"
3657,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,And Anais but faintly pursues the game.
3658,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"An encroaching, inner flame"
3659,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Burns in their hearts with the acrid smoke of unrest;
3660,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"But gaiety runs like quicksilver in Rose's breast,"
3661,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"And Phillis, rising,"
3662,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Walks by herself with high and springy tread,"
3663,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"All her young blood racing from heels to head,"
3664,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Breeding new desires and a new surprising
3665,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Strength and determination,"
3666,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Whereof are bred
3667,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Confidence and joy and exultation.
3668,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,
3669,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,The long day closes;
3670,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Rosalind's hour draws near, and Chloe's and Rose's,"
3671,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"The hour that Celia has prayed,"
3672,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"The hour for which Anais and Stella have stayed,"
3673,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"When Helen shall forget her wit,"
3674,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"And Phillida by a sure arrow at length be hit,"
3675,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"And Phillis, the fleet runner, be at length overtaken;"
3676,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,When this bough of young blossoms
3677,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"By the rough, eager gatherers shall be shaken."
3678,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Their eyes grow dim,"
3679,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Their hearts flutter like taken birds in their bosoms,"
3680,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"As the light dies out of heaven,"
3681,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"And a faint, delicious tremor runs through every limb,"
3682,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,And faster the volatile blood through their veins is driven.
3683,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,
3684,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,The long day closes;
3685,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,The last light fades in the amber sky;
3686,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Warm through the warm dusk glow the roses,"
3687,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"And a heavier shade drops slowly from the trees,"
3688,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,While through the garden as all colours die
3689,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,The scents come livelier on the quickening breeze.
3690,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"The world grows larger, vaguer, dimmer,"
3691,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Over the dark laurels a few faint stars glimmer;
3692,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"The moon, that was a pallid ghost,"
3693,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Hung low on the horizon, faint and lost,"
3694,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Comes up, a full and splendid golden round"
3695,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,By black and sharp-cut foliage overcrossed.
3696,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,The girls laugh and whisper now with hardly a sound
3697,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Till all sound vanishes, dispersed in the night,"
3698,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Like a wisp of cloud that fades in the moon's light,"
3699,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,And the garden grows silent and the shadows grow
3700,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Deeper and blacker below
3701,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"The mysteriously moving and murmuring trees,"
3702,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,That stand out darkly against the star-luminous sky;
3703,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Huge stand the trees,"
3704,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Shadowy, whispering immensities,"
3705,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,That rain down quietude and darkness on heart and eye.
3706,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"None move, none speak, none sigh"
3707,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,But from the laurels comes a leaping voice
3708,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Crying in tones that seem not man's nor boy's,"
3709,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"But only joy's,"
3710,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"And hard behind a loud tumultuous crying,"
3711,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"A tangled skein of noise,"
3712,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"And the girls see their lovers come, each vying"
3713,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Against the next in glad and confident poise,"
3714,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Or softly moving
3715,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,To the side of the chosen with gentle words and loving
3716,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Gifts for her pleasure of sweetmeats and jewelled toys.
3717,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,
3718,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Dear Love, whose strength no pedantry can stir,"
3719,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Whether in thine iron enemies,"
3720,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Or in thine own strayed follower
3721,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Bemused with subtleties and sophistries,"
3722,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Now dost thou rule the garden, now"
3723,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,The gatherers' hands have grasped the scented bough.
3724,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,
3725,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"Slow the sweet hours resolve, and one by one are sped."
3726,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,The garden lieth empty. Overhead
3727,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"A nightjar rustles by, wing touching wing,"
3728,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"And passes, uttering"
3729,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,His hoarse and whirring note.
3730,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"The daylight birds long since are fled,"
3731,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Nor has the moon yet touched the brown bird's throat.
3732,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,
3733,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"All's quiet, all is silent, all around"
3734,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"The day's heat rises gently from the ground,"
3735,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"And still the broad moon travels up the sky,"
3736,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Now glancing through the trees and now so high
3737,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"That all the garden through her rays are shed,"
3738,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,And from the laurels one can just descry
3739,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,Where in the distance looms enormously
3740,FÊTE GALANTE; THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE,"The old house, with all its windows black and dead."

3778,A DREAM IN EARLY SPRING,With sharp reminders of the coming day:
3779,A DREAM IN EARLY SPRING,"After his call, one minute I remain"
3780,A DREAM IN EARLY SPRING,"Unwaked, and on the darkness which is Me"
3781,A DREAM IN EARLY SPRING,"There springs the image of a daffodil,"
3782,A DREAM IN EARLY SPRING,"Growing upon a grassy bank alone,"
3783,A DREAM IN EARLY SPRING,And seeming with great joy his bell to fill
3784,A DREAM IN EARLY SPRING,"With drops of golden dew, which on the lawn"
3785,A DREAM IN EARLY SPRING,"He shakes again, where they lie bright and chill."
3786,A DREAM IN EARLY SPRING,
3787,A DREAM IN EARLY SPRING,His head is drooped; the shrouded winds that sing
3788,A DREAM IN EARLY SPRING,Bend him which way they will: never on earth
3789,A DREAM IN EARLY SPRING,Was there before so beautiful a ghost.
3790,A DREAM IN EARLY SPRING,"Alas! he had a less than flower-birth,"
3791,A DREAM IN EARLY SPRING,And like a ghost indeed must shortly glide
3792,A DREAM IN EARLY SPRING,"From all but the sad cells of memory,"
3793,A DREAM IN EARLY SPRING,"Where he will linger, an imprisoned beam,"
3794,A DREAM IN EARLY SPRING,"Or fallen shadow of the golden world,"

3803,THE WORLD,"Is not more distant, gazing from afar"
3804,THE WORLD,"On the unreapèd pastures of the sea,"
3805,THE WORLD,"Than I am from the world, the world from me."
3806,THE WORLD,At night the stars on milky way that shine
3807,THE WORLD,"Seem things one might possess, but this round green"
3808,THE WORLD,"Is for the cows that rest, these and the sheep:"
3809,THE WORLD,To them the slopes and pastures offer sleep;
3810,THE WORLD,"My sleep I draw from the far fields of blue,"
3811,THE WORLD,Whence cold winds come and go among the few
3812,THE WORLD,Bright stars we see and many more unseen.
3813,THE WORLD,
3814,THE WORLD,"Birds sing on earth all day among the flowers,"
3815,THE WORLD,Taking no thought of any other thing
3816,THE WORLD,"But their own hearts, for out of them they sing:"
3817,THE WORLD,"Their songs are kindred to the blossom heads,"
3818,THE WORLD,"Faint as the petals which the blackthorn sheds,"
3819,THE WORLD,And like the earth--not alien songs as ours.
3820,THE WORLD,To them this greenness and this island peace
3821,THE WORLD,Are life and death and happiness in one;
3822,THE WORLD,"Nor are they separate from the white sun,"
3823,THE WORLD,Or those warm winds which nightly wash the deep
3824,THE WORLD,"Or starlight in the valleys, or new sleep;"
3825,THE WORLD,And from these things they ask for no release.
3826,THE WORLD,
3827,THE WORLD,"But we can never call this world our own,"
3828,THE WORLD,"Because we long for it, and yet we know"
3829,THE WORLD,"That should the great winds call us, we should go;"
3830,THE WORLD,"Should they come calling out across the cold,"
3831,THE WORLD,We should rise up and leave the sheltered fold
3832,THE WORLD,"And follow the great road to the unknown,"
3833,THE WORLD,"We should pass by the barns and haystacks brown,"
3834,THE WORLD,Should leave the wild pool and the nightingale;
3835,THE WORLD,Across the ocean we should set a sail
3836,THE WORLD,"And, coming to the world's pale brim, should fly"

3848,THE NEW GHOST,"Over the young crocuses, where the dew was--"
3849,THE NEW GHOST,"He cast the garment of his flesh that was full of death,"
3850,THE NEW GHOST,And like a sword his spirit showed out of the cold sheath.
3851,THE NEW GHOST,
3852,THE NEW GHOST,"He went a pace or two, he went to meet his Lord,"
3853,THE NEW GHOST,"And, as I said, his spirit looked like a clean sword,"
3854,THE NEW GHOST,"And seeing him the naked trees began shivering,"
3855,THE NEW GHOST,And all the birds cried out aloud as it were late spring.
3856,THE NEW GHOST,
3857,THE NEW GHOST,"And the Lord came on, He came down, and saw"
3858,THE NEW GHOST,"That a soul was waiting there for Him, one without flaw,"
3859,THE NEW GHOST,"And they embraced in the churchyard where the robins play,"
3860,THE NEW GHOST,"And the daffodils hang down their heads, as they burn away."
3861,THE NEW GHOST,
3862,THE NEW GHOST,"The Lord held his head fast, and you could see"
3863,THE NEW GHOST,That he kissed the unsheathed ghost that was gone free--
3864,THE NEW GHOST,"As a hot sun, on a March day, kisses the cold ground;"
3865,THE NEW GHOST,"And the spirit answered, for he knew well that his peace was found."
3866,THE NEW GHOST,
3867,THE NEW GHOST,"The spirit trembled, and sprang up at the Lord's word--"
3868,THE NEW GHOST,"As on a wild, April day, springs a small bird--"
3869,THE NEW GHOST,"So the ghost's feet lifting him up, he kissed the Lord's cheek,"
3870,THE NEW GHOST,And for the greatness of their love neither of them could speak.
3871,THE NEW GHOST,
3872,THE NEW GHOST,"But the Lord went then, to show him the way,"
3873,THE NEW GHOST,"Over the young crocuses, under the green may"
3874,THE NEW GHOST,That was not quite in flower yet--to a far-distant land;
3875,THE NEW GHOST,"And the ghost followed, like a naked cloud holding the sun's hand."

3883,A MAN DREAMS THAT HE IS THE CREATOR,I took the snowflakes one by one
3884,A MAN DREAMS THAT HE IS THE CREATOR,And turned their fragile shapes to glass:
3885,A MAN DREAMS THAT HE IS THE CREATOR,I washed the rivers blue with rain

3887,A MAN DREAMS THAT HE IS THE CREATOR,
3888,A MAN DREAMS THAT HE IS THE CREATOR,"I took the birds and touched their springs,"
3889,A MAN DREAMS THAT HE IS THE CREATOR,Until they sang unearthly joys:
3890,A MAN DREAMS THAT HE IS THE CREATOR,They flew about on golden wings
3891,A MAN DREAMS THAT HE IS THE CREATOR,And glittered like an angel's toys:
3892,A MAN DREAMS THAT HE IS THE CREATOR,"I filled the fields with flowers' eyes,"
3893,A MAN DREAMS THAT HE IS THE CREATOR,As white as stars in Paradise.
3894,A MAN DREAMS THAT HE IS THE CREATOR,
3895,A MAN DREAMS THAT HE IS THE CREATOR,And then I looked on man and knew
3896,A MAN DREAMS THAT HE IS THE CREATOR,Him still intent on death--still proud;
3897,A MAN DREAMS THAT HE IS THE CREATOR,Whereat into a rage I flew
3898,A MAN DREAMS THAT HE IS THE CREATOR,And turned my body to a cloud:

4076,RIVERS,There is something still in the back of my mind
4077,RIVERS,From very far away;
4078,RIVERS,"There is something I saw and see not,"
4079,RIVERS,A country full of rivers
4080,RIVERS,That stirs in my heart and speaks to me
4081,RIVERS,"More sure, more dear than they."
4082,RIVERS,
4083,RIVERS,And always I ask and wonder
4084,RIVERS,(Though often I do not know it):
4085,RIVERS,Why does this water not smell like water?
4086,RIVERS,Where is the moss that grew
4087,RIVERS,Wet and dry on the slabs of granite
4088,RIVERS,And the round stones in clear brown water?
4089,RIVERS,--And a pale film rises before them
4090,RIVERS,Of the rivers that first I knew.
4091,RIVERS,
4092,RIVERS,"Though famous are the rivers of the great world,"
4093,RIVERS,Though my heart from those alien waters drinks
4094,RIVERS,"Delight however pure from their loveliness,"
4095,RIVERS,"And awe however deep,"
4096,RIVERS,"Would I wish for a moment the miracle,"
4097,RIVERS,"That those waters should come to Chagford,"
4098,RIVERS,Or gather and swell in Tavy Cleave
4099,RIVERS,Where the stones cling to the steep?
4100,RIVERS,

4102,RIVERS,"In all their great might and majesty,"
4103,RIVERS,"League upon league of wonders,"

4105,RIVERS,"For a light chiming of small bells,"
4106,RIVERS,"A twisting flash in the granite,"
4107,RIVERS,The tiny thread of a pixie waterfall
4108,RIVERS,That lives by Vixen Tor.
4109,RIVERS,
4110,RIVERS,"Those rivers in that lost country,"
4111,RIVERS,They were brown as a clear brown bead is
4112,RIVERS,"Or red with the earth that rain washed down,"
4113,RIVERS,Or white with china-clay;
4114,RIVERS,"And some tossed foaming over boulders,"
4115,RIVERS,"And some curved mild and tranquil,"
4116,RIVERS,In wooded vales securely set
4117,RIVERS,Under the fond warm day.
4118,RIVERS,
4119,RIVERS,"Okement and Erme and Avon,"
4120,RIVERS,"Exe and his ruffled shallows,"
4121,RIVERS,I could cry as I think of those rivers
4122,RIVERS,That knew my morning dreams;
4123,RIVERS,The weir by Tavistock at evening
4124,RIVERS,"When the circling woods were purple,"
4125,RIVERS,"And the Lowman in spring with the lent-lilies,"
4126,RIVERS,And the little moorland streams.
4127,RIVERS,
4128,RIVERS,For many a hillside streamlet
4129,RIVERS,"There falls with a broken tinkle,"
4130,RIVERS,"Falling and dying, falling and dying,"
4131,RIVERS,"In little cascades and pools,"
4132,RIVERS,Where the world is furze and heather
4133,RIVERS,"And flashing plovers and fixed larks,"
4134,RIVERS,"And an empty sky, whitish blue,"
4135,RIVERS,That small world rules.
4136,RIVERS,
4137,RIVERS,"There, there, where the high waste bog-lands"
4138,RIVERS,"And the drooping slopes and the spreading valleys,"
4139,RIVERS,The orchards and the cattle-sprinkled pastures
4140,RIVERS,"Those travelling musics fill,"
4141,RIVERS,"There is my lost Abana,"
4142,RIVERS,And there is my nameless Pharphar
4143,RIVERS,"That mixed with my heart when I was a boy,"
4144,RIVERS,And time stood still.
4145,RIVERS,
4146,RIVERS,And I say I will go there and die there:
4147,RIVERS,"But I do not go there, and sometimes"
4148,RIVERS,"I think that the train could not carry me there,"
4149,RIVERS,"And it's possible, maybe,"

4211,THE BIRDS,"Hammering, hewing, digging tunnels, roads;"
4212,THE BIRDS,"Building ships, temples, multiform abodes."

4244,THE BIRDS,A million years before Atlantis was
4245,THE BIRDS,"Our lark sprang from some hollow in the grass,"

4249,THE BIRDS,And rooks their villages of twiggy rafts
4250,THE BIRDS,"Set on the tops of elms, where elms grew then,"
4251,THE BIRDS,And still the thumbling tit and perky wren
4252,THE BIRDS,Popped through the tiny doors of cosy balls
4253,THE BIRDS,And the blackbird lined with moss his high-built walls;
4254,THE BIRDS,"A round mud cottage held the thrush's young,"
4255,THE BIRDS,And straws from the untidy sparrow's hung.
4256,THE BIRDS,"And, skimming forktailed in the evening air,"
4257,THE BIRDS,When man first was were not the martens there?
4258,THE BIRDS,"Did not those birds some human shelter crave,"

4271,THE BIRDS,Blotches of rusty red on ledge and cleft
4272,THE BIRDS,"With grey-green spots on them, while right and left"
4273,THE BIRDS,"A dizzying tangle of gulls were floating and flying,"
4274,THE BIRDS,"Wheeling and crossing and darting, crying and crying,"

4504,PEACE,Upon the sentries that were dead as trees.
4505,PEACE,
4506,PEACE,"His shining shield lay in an old grey town,"
4507,PEACE,"And white swans sailed so still and dreamfully,"
4508,PEACE,"They seemed the thoughts of those white, peaceful hills"
4509,PEACE,Mirrored that day within his glazing eyes.
4510,PEACE,
4511,PEACE,"And in the square the pale cool butter sold,"
4512,PEACE,"Cropped from the daisies sprinkled on the downs,"
4513,PEACE,"And old wives cried their wares, like queer day owls,"
4514,PEACE,Piercing the old men's sad and foolish dreams.
4515,PEACE,
4516,PEACE,And Time flowed on till all the realm forgot
4517,PEACE,The great King lying in the low chalk hills;
4518,PEACE,Only the busy water dripping through
4519,PEACE,His hard white bones knew of him lying there.
4520,PEACE,
4521,PEACE,
4522,PEACE,
4523,DEATH,DEATH
4524,DEATH,
4525,DEATH,When I am dead a few poor souls shall grieve
4526,DEATH,As I grieved for my brother long ago.
4527,DEATH,"Scarce did my eyes grow dim,"
4528,DEATH,I had forgotten him;
4529,DEATH,"I was far-off hearing the spring winds blow,"
4530,DEATH,And many summers burned
4531,DEATH,"When, though still reeling with my eyes aflame,"
4532,DEATH,I heard that faded name
4533,DEATH,Whispered one Spring amid the hurrying world
4534,DEATH,"From which, years gone, he turned."
4535,DEATH,
4536,DEATH,I looked up at my windows and I saw
4537,DEATH,"The trees, thin spectres sucked forth by the moon."
4538,DEATH,The air was very still
4539,DEATH,Above a distant hill;
4540,DEATH,It was the hour of night's full silver moon.
4541,DEATH,'O are thou there my brother?' my soul cried;
4542,DEATH,"And all the pale stars down bright rivers wept,"
4543,DEATH,As my heart sadly crept
4544,DEATH,"About the empty hills, bathed in that light"
4545,DEATH,That lapped him when he died.
4546,DEATH,
4547,DEATH,"Ah! it was cold, so cold; do I not know"
4548,DEATH,How dead my heart on that remembered day!
4549,DEATH,Clear in a far-away place
4550,DEATH,I see his delicate face
4551,DEATH,"Just as he called me from my solitary play,"
4552,DEATH,Giving into my hands a tiny tree.
4553,DEATH,"We planted it in the dark, blossomless ground"
4554,DEATH,"Gravely, without a sound;"
4555,DEATH,Then back I went and left him standing by
4556,DEATH,His birthday gift to me.
4557,DEATH,
4558,DEATH,In that far land perchance it quietly grows
4559,DEATH,"Drinking the rain, making a pleasant shade;"
4560,DEATH,Birds in its branches fly
4561,DEATH,Out of the fathomless sky
4562,DEATH,Where worlds of circling light arise and fade.
4563,DEATH,"Blindly it quivers in the bright flood of day,"
4564,DEATH,Or drowned in multitudinous shouts of rain
4565,DEATH,Glooms o'er the dark-veiled plain--
4566,DEATH,"Buried below, the ghost that's in his bones"
4567,DEATH,Dreams in the sodden clay.
4568,DEATH,
4569,DEATH,"And, while he faded, drunk with beauty's eyes"
4570,DEATH,"I kissed bright girls and laughed deep in dumb trees,"
4571,DEATH,That stared fixt in the air
4572,DEATH,Like madmen in despair
4573,DEATH,Gaped up from earth with the escaping breeze.
4574,DEATH,I saw earth's exaltation slowly creep
4575,DEATH,Out of their myriad sky-embracing veins.
4576,DEATH,"I laughed along the lanes,"
4577,DEATH,Meeting Death riding in from the hollow seas
4578,DEATH,Through black-wreathed woods asleep.
4579,DEATH,
4580,DEATH,"I laughed, I swaggered on the cold hard ground--"
4581,DEATH,Through the grey air trembled a falling wave--
4582,DEATH,"'Thou'rt pale, O Death!' I cried,"
4583,DEATH,Mocking him in my pride;
4584,DEATH,"And passing I dreamed not of that lonely grave,"
4585,DEATH,"But of leaf-maidens whose pale, moon-like hands"
4586,DEATH,"Above the tree-foam waved in the icy air,"
4587,DEATH,Sweeping with shining hair
4588,DEATH,"Through the green-tinted sky, one moment fled"
4589,DEATH,Out of immortal lands.
4590,DEATH,
4591,DEATH,One windless Autumn night the Moon came out
4592,DEATH,"In a white sea of cloud, a field of snow;"
4593,DEATH,"In darkness shaped of trees,"
4594,DEATH,I sank upon my knees
4595,DEATH,"And watched her shining, from the small wood below--"
4596,DEATH,Faintly Death flickered in an owl's far cry---
4597,DEATH,"We floated soundless in the great gulf of space,"
4598,DEATH,Her light upon my face--
4599,DEATH,"Immortal, shining in that dark wood I knelt"
4600,DEATH,And knew I could not die.
4601,DEATH,
4602,DEATH,"And knew I could not die--O Death, didst thou"
4603,DEATH,"Heed my vain glory, standing pale by thy dead?"
4604,DEATH,There is a spirit who grieves
4605,DEATH,Amid earth's dying leaves;
4606,DEATH,Was't thou that wept beside my brother's bed?
4607,DEATH,For I did never mourn nor heed at all
4608,DEATH,Him passing on his temporal elm-wood bier;
4609,DEATH,I never shed a tear.
4610,DEATH,"The drooping sky spread grey-winged through my soul,"
4611,DEATH,While stones and earth did fall.
4612,DEATH,
4613,DEATH,That sound rings down the years--I hear it yet--
4614,DEATH,All earthly life's a winding funeral--
4615,DEATH,"And though I never wept,"
4616,DEATH,"But into the dark coach stept,"
4617,DEATH,"Dreaming by night to answer the blood's sweet call,"
4618,DEATH,"She who stood there, high-breasted, with small, wise lips,"
4619,DEATH,"And gave me wine to drink and bread to eat,"
4620,DEATH,"Has not more steadfast feet,"
4621,DEATH,But fades from my arms as fade from mariners' eyes
4622,DEATH,The sea's most beauteous ships.
4623,DEATH,
4624,DEATH,The trees and hills of earth were once as close
4625,DEATH,"As my own brother, they are becoming dreams"
4626,DEATH,And shadows in my eyes;
4627,DEATH,More dimly lies
4628,DEATH,"Guaya deep in my soul, the coastline gleams"
4629,DEATH,Faintly along the darkening crystalline seas.
4630,DEATH,"Glimmering and lovely still, 'twill one day go;"
4631,DEATH,The surging dark will flow
4632,DEATH,"Over my hopes and joys, and blot out all"
4633,DEATH,Earth's hills and skies and trees.
4634,DEATH,
4635,DEATH,I shall look up one night and see the Moon
4636,DEATH,"For the last time shining above the hills,"
4637,DEATH,"And thou, silent, wilt ride"
4638,DEATH,Over the dark hillside.
4639,DEATH,"'Twill be, perchance, the time of daffodils--"
4640,DEATH,_'How come those bright immortals in the woods?
4641,DEATH,"Their joy being young, didst thou not drag them all"
4642,DEATH,Into dark graves ere Fall?'_
4643,DEATH,"Shall life thus haunt me, wondering, as I go"
4644,DEATH,To thy deep solitudes?
4645,DEATH,
4646,DEATH,There is a figure with a down-turned torch
4647,DEATH,"Carved on a pillar in an olden time,"
4648,DEATH,A calm and lovely boy
4649,DEATH,Who comes not to destroy
4650,DEATH,But to lead age back to its golden prime.
4651,DEATH,"Thus did an antique sculptor draw thee, Death,"
4652,DEATH,"With smooth and beauteous brow and faint sweet smile,"
4653,DEATH,"Not haggard, gaunt and vile,"
4654,DEATH,"And thou perhaps art thus to whom men may,"
4655,DEATH,"Unvexed, give up their breath."
4656,DEATH,
4657,DEATH,But in my soul thou sittest like a dream
4658,DEATH,"Among earth's mountains, by her dim-coloured seas;"
4659,DEATH,A wild unearthly Shape
4660,DEATH,"In thy dark-glimmering cape,"
4661,DEATH,"Piping a tune of wavering melodies,"
4662,DEATH,"Thou sittest, ay, thou sittest at the feast"
4663,DEATH,"Of my brief life among earth's bright-wreathed flowers,"
4664,DEATH,Staining the dancing hours
4665,DEATH,"With sombre gleams until, abrupt, thou risest"
4666,DEATH,"And all, at once, is ceased."
