109,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,
110,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"Three Summers since I chose a maid,"
111,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,Too young maybe--but more’s to do
112,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,At harvest-time than bide and woo.
113,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,When us was wed she turned afraid
114,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,Of love and me and all things human;
115,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,Like the shut of a winter’s day.
116,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"Her smile went out, and ’twasn’t a woman--"
117,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,More like a little frightened fay.
118,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"One night, in the Fall, she runned away."
119,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,
120,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"“Out ’mong the sheep, her be,” they said,"
121,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,’Should properly have been abed;
122,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,But sure enough she wasn’t there
123,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,Lying awake with her wide brown stare.
124,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,So over seven-acre field and up-along across the down
125,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"We chased her, flying like a hare"
126,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,Before our lanterns. To Church-Town
127,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,All in a shiver and a scare
128,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"We caught her, fetched her home at last"
129,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"And turned the key upon her, fast."
130,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,
131,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,She does the work about the house
132,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"As well as most, but like a mouse:"
133,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,Happy enough to chat and play
134,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"With birds and rabbits and such as they,"
135,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,So long as men-folk keep away.
136,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"“Not near, not near!” her eyes beseech"
137,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,When one of us comes within reach.
138,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,The women say that beasts in stall
139,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,Look round like children at her call.
140,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,_I’ve_ hardly heard her speak at all.
141,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,
142,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"Shy as a leveret, swift as he,"
143,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"Straight and slight as a young larch tree,"
144,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"Sweet as the first wild violets, she,"
145,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,To her wild self. But what to me?
146,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"The short days shorten and the oaks are brown,"
147,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"The blue smoke rises to the low grey sky,"
148,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"One leaf in the still air falls slowly down,"
149,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,A magpie’s spotted feathers lie
150,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"On the black earth spread white with rime,"
151,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,The berries redden up to Christmas-time.
152,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,What’s Christmas-time without there be
153,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,Some other in the house than we!
154,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,
155,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,She sleeps up in the attic there
156,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"Alone, poor maid. ’Tis but a stair"
157,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"Betwixt us. Oh! my God! the down,"
158,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"The soft young down of her, the brown,"
159,THE FARMER’S BRIDE,"The brown of her--her eyes, her hair, her hair!"

170,FAME,"Where no one fits the singer to his song,"
171,FAME,Or sifts the unpainted from the painted faces
172,FAME,Of the people who are always on my stair;
173,FAME,They were not with me when I walked in heavenly places;
174,FAME,But could I spare
175,FAME,"In the blind Earth’s great silences and spaces,"
176,FAME,"The din, the scuffle, the long stare"
177,FAME,If I went back and it was not there?
178,FAME,"Back to the old known things that are the new,"
179,FAME,"The folded glory of the gorse, the sweet-briar air,"
180,FAME,"To the larks that cannot praise us, knowing nothing of what we do"
181,FAME,"And the divine, wise trees that do not care"
182,FAME,"Yet, to leave Fame, still with such eyes and that bright hair!"
183,FAME,God! If I might! And before I go hence
184,FAME,Take in her stead
185,FAME,"To our tossed bed,"
186,FAME,"One little dream, no matter how small, how wild."
187,FAME,"Just now, I think I found it in a field, under a fence--"
188,FAME,"A frail, dead, new-born lamb, ghostly and pitiful and white."
189,FAME,"A blot upon the night,"
190,FAME,The moon’s dropped child!

200,THE NARROW DOOR,"Mostly at shop with pebbles from the shore,"
201,THE NARROW DOOR,It is always shut this narrow door
202,THE NARROW DOOR,But open for a little while to-day.
203,THE NARROW DOOR,
204,THE NARROW DOOR,"And round it, each with pebbles in his hand,"
205,THE NARROW DOOR,A silenced crowd the café children stand
206,THE NARROW DOOR,To see the long box jerking down the bend
207,THE NARROW DOOR,"Of twisted stair; then set on end,"
208,THE NARROW DOOR,Quite filling up the narrow door
209,THE NARROW DOOR,Till it comes out and does not go in any more.
210,THE NARROW DOOR,
211,THE NARROW DOOR,"Along the quay you see it wind,"
212,THE NARROW DOOR,The slow black line. Someone pulls up the blind
213,THE NARROW DOOR,Of the small window just above the narrow door--
214,THE NARROW DOOR,"_“Tiens! que veux-tu acheter?”_ Rénée cries,"
215,THE NARROW DOOR,"_“Mais, pour quat’sous, des oignons,”_ Jean replies"
216,THE NARROW DOOR,And one pays down with pebbles from the shore.

222,THE FÊTE,
223,THE FÊTE,
224,THE FÊTE,To-night again the moon’s white mat
225,THE FÊTE,Stretches across the dormitory floor
226,THE FÊTE,"While outside, like an evil cat"
227,THE FÊTE,"The _pion_ prowls down the dark corridor,"
228,THE FÊTE,"Planning, I know, to pounce on me, in spite"
229,THE FÊTE,For getting leave to sleep in town last night.
230,THE FÊTE,"But it was none of us who made that noise,"
231,THE FÊTE,Only the old brown owl that hoots and flies
232,THE FÊTE,Out of the ivy--he will say it was us boys--
233,THE FÊTE,_Seigneur mon Dieu!_ the _sacré_ soul of spies!
234,THE FÊTE,He would like to catch each dream that lies
235,THE FÊTE,Hidden behind our sleepy eyes:
236,THE FÊTE,Their dream? But mine--it is the moon and the wood that sees;
237,THE FÊTE,All my long life how I shall hate the trees!
238,THE FÊTE,
239,THE FÊTE,"In the _Place d’Armes_, the dusty planes, all Summer through"
240,THE FÊTE,Dozed with the market women in the sun and scarcely stirred
241,THE FÊTE,"To see the quiet things that crossed the Square--,"
242,THE FÊTE,"A tiny funeral, the flying shadow of a bird,"
243,THE FÊTE,"The hump-backed barber Célestin Lemaire,"
244,THE FÊTE,"Old madame Michel in her three-wheeled chair,"
245,THE FÊTE,"And filing past to Vespers, two and two,"
246,THE FÊTE,The _demoiselles_ of the _pensionnat_.
247,THE FÊTE,"Towed like a ship through the harbour bar,"
248,THE FÊTE,"Safe into port, where _le petit Jésus_"
249,THE FÊTE,Perhaps makes nothing of the look they shot at you:
250,THE FÊTE,"_Si, c’est défendu, mais que voulez-vous?_"
251,THE FÊTE,It was the sun. The sunshine weaves
252,THE FÊTE,A pattern on dull stones: the sunshine leaves
253,THE FÊTE,The portraiture of dreams upon the eyes
254,THE FÊTE,Before it dies:
255,THE FÊTE,All Summer through
256,THE FÊTE,The dust hung white upon the drowsy planes
257,THE FÊTE,Till suddenly they woke with the Autumn rains.
258,THE FÊTE,It is not only the little boys
259,THE FÊTE,"Who have hardly got away from toys,"
260,THE FÊTE,"But I, who am seventeen next year,"
261,THE FÊTE,"Some nights, in bed, have grown cold to hear"
262,THE FÊTE,That lonely passion of the rain
263,THE FÊTE,"Which makes you think of being dead,"
264,THE FÊTE,And of somewhere living to lay your head
265,THE FÊTE,"As if you were a child again,"
266,THE FÊTE,"Crying for one thing, known and near"
267,THE FÊTE,"Your empty heart, to still the hunger and the fear"
268,THE FÊTE,That pelts and beats with it against the pane.
269,THE FÊTE,
270,THE FÊTE,But I remember smiling too
271,THE FÊTE,At all the sun’s soft tricks and those Autumn dreads
272,THE FÊTE,"In winter time, when the grey light broke slowly through"
273,THE FÊTE,The frosted window-lace to drag us shivering from our beds.
274,THE FÊTE,And when at dusk the singing wind swung down
275,THE FÊTE,Straight from the stars to the dark country roads
276,THE FÊTE,"Beyond the twinkling town,"
277,THE FÊTE,"Striking the leafless poplar boughs as he went by,"
278,THE FÊTE,"Like some poor, stray dog by the wayside lying dead,"
279,THE FÊTE,"We left behind us the old world of dread,"
280,THE FÊTE,I and the wind as we strode whistling on under the Winter sky.
281,THE FÊTE,
282,THE FÊTE,And then in Spring for three days came the Fair
283,THE FÊTE,Just as the planes were starting into bud
284,THE FÊTE,Above the caravans: you saw the dancing bear
285,THE FÊTE,Pass on his chain; and heard the jingle and the thud.
286,THE FÊTE,Only four days ago
287,THE FÊTE,They let you out of this dull show
288,THE FÊTE,To slither down the _montagne russe_ and chaff the man _à la
289,THE FÊTE,tête de veau_--
290,THE FÊTE,"Hit, slick, the bull’s eye at the _tir_,"
291,THE FÊTE,Spin round and round till your head went queer
292,THE FÊTE,On the _porcs-roulants. Oh! là là! la fête!_
293,THE FÊTE,"_Va pour du vin, et le tête-a-tête_"
294,THE FÊTE,"With the girl who sugars the _quafres! Pauvrette_,"
295,THE FÊTE,"How thin she was; but she smiled, you bet,"
296,THE FÊTE,As she took your tip--“One does not forget
297,THE FÊTE,"The good days, Monsieur.” Said with a grace,"
298,THE FÊTE,But _sacrébleu!_ what a ghost of a face!
299,THE FÊTE,And no fun too for the _demoiselles_
300,THE FÊTE,"Of the _pensionnat_, who were hurried past,"
301,THE FÊTE,"With their _“Oh, que c’est beau--Ah, qu’elle est belle!”_"
302,THE FÊTE,A lap-dog’s life from first to last!
303,THE FÊTE,"The good nights are not made for sleep, nor the good days"
304,THE FÊTE,"for dreaming in,"
305,THE FÊTE,And at the end in the big Circus tent we sat and shook
306,THE FÊTE,and stewed like sin!
307,THE FÊTE,
308,THE FÊTE,Some children there had got--but where?
309,THE FÊTE,"Sent from the south, perhaps--a red bouquet"
310,THE FÊTE,"Of roses, sweetening the fetid air"
311,THE FÊTE,With scent from gardens by some far away blue bay.
312,THE FÊTE,They threw one at the dancing bear;
313,THE FÊTE,The white clown caught it. From St. Rémy’s tower
314,THE FÊTE,"The deep, slow bell tolled out the hour;"
315,THE FÊTE,"The black clown, with his dirty grin"
316,THE FÊTE,"Lay, sprawling in the dust, as She rode in."
317,THE FÊTE,
318,THE FÊTE,She stood on a white horse--and suddenly you saw the bend
319,THE FÊTE,"Of a far-off road at dawn, with knights riding by,"
320,THE FÊTE,A field of spears--and then the gallant day
321,THE FÊTE,"Go out in storm, with ragged clouds low down, sullen and grey"
322,THE FÊTE,"Against red heavens: wild and awful, such a sky"
323,THE FÊTE,As witnesses against you at the end
324,THE FÊTE,"Of a great battle; bugles blowing, blood and dust--"
325,THE FÊTE,"The old _Morte d’Arthur_, fight you must--."
326,THE FÊTE,It died in anger. But it was not death
327,THE FÊTE,"That had you by the throat, stopping your breath."
328,THE FÊTE,She looked like Victory. She rode my way.
329,THE FÊTE,
330,THE FÊTE,She laughed at the black clown and then she flew
331,THE FÊTE,"A bird above us, on the wing"
332,THE FÊTE,Of her white arms; and you saw through
333,THE FÊTE,"A rent in the old tent, a patch of sky"
334,THE FÊTE,"With one dim star. She flew, but not so high--"
335,THE FÊTE,And then she did not fly;
336,THE FÊTE,She stood in the bright moonlight at the door
337,THE FÊTE,"Of a strange room, she threw her slippers on the floor--"
338,THE FÊTE,"Again, again"
339,THE FÊTE,"You heard the patter of the rain,"
340,THE FÊTE,"The starving rain--it was this Thing,"
341,THE FÊTE,"Summer was this, the gold mist in your eyes;--"
342,THE FÊTE,"Oh God! it dies,"
343,THE FÊTE,"But after death--,"
344,THE FÊTE,To-night the splendour and the sting
345,THE FÊTE,"Blows back and catches at your breath,"
346,THE FÊTE,"The smell of beasts, the smell of dust, the scent of all the"
347,THE FÊTE,"roses in the world, the sea, the Spring,"
348,THE FÊTE,"The beat of drums, the pad of hoofs, music, the dream,"
349,THE FÊTE,"the dream, the Enchanted Thing!"
350,THE FÊTE,
351,THE FÊTE,"At first you scarcely saw her face,"
352,THE FÊTE,"You knew the maddening feet were there,"
353,THE FÊTE,"What called was that half-hidden, white unrest"
354,THE FÊTE,To which now and then she pressed
355,THE FÊTE,Her finger tips; but as she slackened pace
356,THE FÊTE,And turned and looked at you it grew quite bare:
357,THE FÊTE,There was not anything you did not dare:--
358,THE FÊTE,Like trumpeters the hours passed until the last day of the Fair.
359,THE FÊTE,
360,THE FÊTE,In the _Place d’Armes_ all afternoon
361,THE FÊTE,"The building birds had sung “Soon, soon,”"
362,THE FÊTE,"The shuttered streets slept sound that night,"
363,THE FÊTE,It was full moon:
364,THE FÊTE,"The path into the wood was almost white,"
365,THE FÊTE,The trees were very still and seemed to stare:
366,THE FÊTE,"Not far before your soul the Dream flits on,"
367,THE FÊTE,"But when you touch it, it is gone"
368,THE FÊTE,And quite alone your soul stands there.
369,THE FÊTE,
370,THE FÊTE,"Mother of Christ, no one has seen your eyes: how can men pray"
371,THE FÊTE,Even unto you?
372,THE FÊTE,There were only wolves’ eyes in the wood--
373,THE FÊTE,My Mother is a woman too:
374,THE FÊTE,"Nothing is true that is not good,"
375,THE FÊTE,"With that quick smile of hers, I have heard her say;--"
376,THE FÊTE,I wish I had gone back home to-day;
377,THE FÊTE,I should have watched the light that so gently dies
378,THE FÊTE,"From our high window, in the Paris skies,"
379,THE FÊTE,"The long, straight chain"
380,THE FÊTE,Of lamps hung out along the Seine:
381,THE FÊTE,I would have turned to her and let the rain
382,THE FÊTE,Beat on her breast as it does against the pane;--
383,THE FÊTE,Nothing will be the same again;--
384,THE FÊTE,"There is something strange in my little Mother’s eyes,"
385,THE FÊTE,There is something new in the old heavenly air of Spring--
386,THE FÊTE,"The smell of beasts, the smell of dust--_The Enchanted Thing!_"
387,THE FÊTE,
388,THE FÊTE,All my life long I shall see moonlight on the fern
389,THE FÊTE,And the black trunks of trees. Only the hair
390,THE FÊTE,Of any woman can belong to God.
391,THE FÊTE,"The stalks are cruelly broken where we trod,"
392,THE FÊTE,"There had been violets there,"
393,THE FÊTE,I shall not care
394,THE FÊTE,As I used to do when I see the bracken burn.

403,BESIDE THE BED,The wandering hands quietly covering the unquiet breast:
404,BESIDE THE BED,"So, smoothed and silenced you lie, like a child, not again"
405,BESIDE THE BED,to be questioned or scolded;
406,BESIDE THE BED,"But, for you, not one of us believes that this is rest."
407,BESIDE THE BED,
408,BESIDE THE BED,Not so to close the windows down can cloud and deaden
409,BESIDE THE BED,The blue beyond: or to screen the wavering flame subdue
410,BESIDE THE BED,its breath:
411,BESIDE THE BED,"Why, if I lay my cheek to your cheek, your grey lips, like"
412,BESIDE THE BED,"dawn, would quiver and redden,"
413,BESIDE THE BED,"Breaking into the old, odd smile at this fraud of death."
414,BESIDE THE BED,
415,BESIDE THE BED,Because all night you have not turned to us or spoken
416,BESIDE THE BED,It is time for you to wake; your dreams were never very deep:
417,BESIDE THE BED,"I, for one, have seen the thin, bright, twisted threads of them"
418,BESIDE THE BED,"dimmed suddenly and broken,"
419,BESIDE THE BED,This is only a most piteous pretence of sleep!

424,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY
425,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,
426,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,
427,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,It is the clay that makes the earth stick to his spade;
428,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,He fills in holes like this year after year;
429,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"The others have gone; they were tired, and half afraid,"
430,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,But I would rather be standing here;
431,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,
432,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,There is nowhere else to go. I have seen this place
433,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,From the windows of the train that’s going past
434,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,Against the sky. This is rain on my face--
435,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,It was raining here when I saw it last.
436,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,
437,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,There is something horrible about a flower;
438,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"This, broken in my hand, is one of those"
439,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,He threw in just now: it will not live another hour;
440,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,There are thousands more: you do not miss a rose.
441,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,
442,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,One of the children hanging about
443,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,Pointed at the whole dreadful heap and smiled
444,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"This morning, after THAT was carried out;"
445,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,There is something terrible about a child.
446,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,
447,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"We were like children, last week, in the Strand;"
448,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,That was the day you laughed at me
449,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,Because I tried to make you understand
450,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"The cheap, stale chap I used to be"
451,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,Before I saw the things you made me see.
452,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,
453,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,This is not a real place; perhaps by-and-by
454,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,I shall wake--I am getting drenched with all this rain:
455,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,To-morrow I will tell you about the eyes of the Crystal
456,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,Palace train
457,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"Looking down on us, and you will laugh and I shall"
458,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,see what you see again.
459,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,
460,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"Not here, not now. We said “Not yet"
461,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,Across our low stone parapet
462,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,Will the quick shadows of the sparrows fall.”
463,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,But still it was a lovely thing
464,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,Through the grey months to wait for Spring
465,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,With the birds that go a-gypsying
466,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,In the parks till the blue seas call.
467,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"And next to these, you used to care"
468,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"For the lions in Trafalgar Square,"
469,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,Who’ll stand and speak for London when her bell of Judgment
470,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,tolls--
471,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,And the gulls at Westminster there were
472,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,The old sea-captains’ souls.
473,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"To-day again the brown tide splashes, step by step, the river stair,"
474,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,And the gulls are there!
475,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,
476,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,By a month we have missed our Day:
477,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,The children would have hung about
478,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,Round the carriage and over the way
479,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,As you and I came out.
480,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,
481,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,We should have stood on the gulls’ black cliffs and heard the sea
482,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"And seen the moon’s white track,"
483,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"I would have called, you would have come to me"
484,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,And kissed me back.
485,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,
486,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,You have never done that: I do not know
487,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,Why I stood staring at your bed
488,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"And heard you, though you spoke so low,"
489,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"But could not reach your hands, your little head."
490,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"There was nothing we could not do, you said,"
491,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"And you went, and I let you go!"
492,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,
493,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"Now I will burn you back, I will burn you through,"
494,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,Though I am damned for it we two will lie
495,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"And burn, here where the starlings fly"
496,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,To these white stones from the wet sky--;
497,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"Dear, you will say this is not I--"
498,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"It would not be you, it would not be you!"
499,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,
500,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,If for only a little while
501,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"You will think of it you will understand,"
502,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,If you will touch my sleeve and smile
503,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,As you did that morning in the Strand
504,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,I can wait quietly with you
505,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,Or go away if you want me to--
506,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,God! What is God? but your face has gone and your hand!
507,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,Let me stay here too.
508,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,
509,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,When I was quite a little lad
510,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,At Christmas time we went half mad
511,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"For joy of all the toys we had,"
512,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,And then we used to sing about the sheep
513,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,The shepherds watched by night;
514,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,We used to pray to Christ to keep
515,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,Our small souls safe till morning light--;
516,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"I am scared, I am staying with you to-night--"
517,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,Put me to sleep.
518,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,
519,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,I shall stay here: here you can see the sky;
520,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,The houses in the streets are much too high;
521,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,There is no one left to speak to there;
522,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,"Here they are everywhere,"
523,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,And just above them fields and fields of roses lie--
524,IN NUNHEAD CEMETERY,If he would dig it all up again they would not die.

542,THE PEDLAR,"How if we stopped and let our solemn selves go by,"

559,PÉCHERESSE,While here and there a house looms white
560,PÉCHERESSE,"Against the gloom of the waterside,"
561,PÉCHERESSE,And some high window throws a light
562,PÉCHERESSE,As they sail out into the night.
563,PÉCHERESSE,
564,PÉCHERESSE,At dawn they will bring in again
565,PÉCHERESSE,To women knitting on the quay
566,PÉCHERESSE,"Who wait for him, their man of men;"
567,PÉCHERESSE,"I stand with them, and watch the sea"
568,PÉCHERESSE,Which may have taken mine from me.
569,PÉCHERESSE,
570,PÉCHERESSE,Just so the long days come and go.
571,PÉCHERESSE,"The nights, ma Doué! the nights are cold!"
572,PÉCHERESSE,"Our Lady’s heart is as frozen snow,"
573,PÉCHERESSE,Since this one sin I have not told;
574,PÉCHERESSE,And I shall die or perhaps grow old
575,PÉCHERESSE,
576,PÉCHERESSE,Before he comes. The foreign ships
577,PÉCHERESSE,Bring many a one of face and name
578,PÉCHERESSE,"As strange as his, to buy your lips,"
579,PÉCHERESSE,A gold piece for a scarlet shame
580,PÉCHERESSE,Like mine. But mine was not the same.
581,PÉCHERESSE,
582,PÉCHERESSE,"One night was ours, one short grey day"
583,PÉCHERESSE,"Of sudden sin, unshrived, untold."
584,PÉCHERESSE,"He found me, and I lost the way"
585,PÉCHERESSE,To Paradise for him. I sold
586,PÉCHERESSE,My soul for love and not for gold.
587,PÉCHERESSE,
588,PÉCHERESSE,"He bought my soul, but even so,"
589,PÉCHERESSE,"My face is all that he has seen,"
590,PÉCHERESSE,"His is the only face I know,"
591,PÉCHERESSE,"And in the dark church, like a screen,"
592,PÉCHERESSE,It shuts God out; it comes between;
593,PÉCHERESSE,
594,PÉCHERESSE,While in some narrow foreign street
595,PÉCHERESSE,"Or loitering on the crowded quay,"
596,PÉCHERESSE,Who knows what others he may meet
597,PÉCHERESSE,To turn his eyes away from me?
598,PÉCHERESSE,Many are fair to such as he!
599,PÉCHERESSE,
600,PÉCHERESSE,There is but one for such as I
601,PÉCHERESSE,"To love, to hate, to hunger for;"

605,PÉCHERESSE,
606,PÉCHERESSE,"Just so the long days come and go,"
607,PÉCHERESSE,Yet this one sin I will not tell
608,PÉCHERESSE,Though Mary’s heart is as frozen snow
609,PÉCHERESSE,And all nights are cold for one warmed too well.

642,THE CHANGELING,"The arms of it waved and the wings of it quivered,"
643,THE CHANGELING,Whoo--I knew it had come for me;
644,THE CHANGELING,Some are as bad as bad can be!
645,THE CHANGELING,"All night long they danced in the rain,"
646,THE CHANGELING,"Round and round in a dripping chain,"
647,THE CHANGELING,"Threw their caps at the window-pane,"
648,THE CHANGELING,Tried to make me scream and shout
649,THE CHANGELING,And fling the bedclothes all about:
650,THE CHANGELING,"I meant to stay in bed that night,"
651,THE CHANGELING,And if only you had left a light
652,THE CHANGELING,They would never have got me out.
653,THE CHANGELING,"Sometimes I wouldn’t speak, you see,"
654,THE CHANGELING,"Or answer when you spoke to me,"
655,THE CHANGELING,"Because in the long, still dusks of Spring"
656,THE CHANGELING,You can hear the whole world whispering;
657,THE CHANGELING,"The shy green grasses making love,"
658,THE CHANGELING,"The feathers grow on the dear, grey dove,"
659,THE CHANGELING,"The tiny heart of the redstart beat,"
660,THE CHANGELING,"The patter of the squirrel’s feet,"
661,THE CHANGELING,"The pebbles pushing in the silver streams,"
662,THE CHANGELING,"The rushes talking in their dreams,"
663,THE CHANGELING,"The swish-swish of the bat’s black wings,"
664,THE CHANGELING,"The wild-wood bluebell’s sweet ting-tings,"
665,THE CHANGELING,"Humming and hammering at your ear,"
666,THE CHANGELING,Everything there is to hear
667,THE CHANGELING,"In the heart of hidden things,"
668,THE CHANGELING,"But not in the midst of the nursery riot,"
669,THE CHANGELING,That’s why I wanted to be quiet
670,THE CHANGELING,"Couldn’t do my sums, or sing,"
671,THE CHANGELING,Or settle down to anything.
672,THE CHANGELING,"And when, for that, I was sent upstairs"
673,THE CHANGELING,I _did_ kneel down to say my prayers;
674,THE CHANGELING,But the King who sits on your high church steeple
675,THE CHANGELING,Has nothing to do with us fairy people!
676,THE CHANGELING,
677,THE CHANGELING,"’Times I pleased you, dear Father, dear Mother,"
678,THE CHANGELING,"Learned all my lessons and liked to play,"
679,THE CHANGELING,And dearly I loved the little pale brother
680,THE CHANGELING,Whom some other bird must have called away.
681,THE CHANGELING,Why did They bring me here to make me
682,THE CHANGELING,"Not quite bad and not quite good,"
683,THE CHANGELING,"Why, unless They’re wicked, do They want, in spite, to take me"
684,THE CHANGELING,"Back to their wet, wild wood?"
685,THE CHANGELING,"Now, every night I shall see the windows shining,"
686,THE CHANGELING,"The gold lamp’s glow, and the fire’s red gleam,"
687,THE CHANGELING,While the best of us are twining twigs and the rest of us are
688,THE CHANGELING,whining
689,THE CHANGELING,In the hollow by the stream.
690,THE CHANGELING,Black and chill are Their nights on the wold;
691,THE CHANGELING,And They live so long and They feel no pain:
692,THE CHANGELING,"I shall grow up, but never grow old,"
693,THE CHANGELING,"I shall always, always be very cold,"
694,THE CHANGELING,I shall never come back again!

699,KEN,KEN
700,KEN,
701,KEN,
702,KEN,"The town is old and very steep,"
703,KEN,"A place of bells and cloisters and grey towers,"
704,KEN,And black clad people walking in their sleep--
705,KEN,"A nun, a priest, a woman taking flowers"
706,KEN,To her new grave; and watched from end to end
707,KEN,"By the great Church above, through the still hours:"
708,KEN,But in the morning and the early dark
709,KEN,The children wake to dart from doors and call
710,KEN,"Down the wide, crooked street, where, at the bend,"
711,KEN,"Before it climbs up to the park,"
712,KEN,Ken’s is the gabled house facing the Castle wall.
713,KEN,
714,KEN,When first I came upon him there
715,KEN,"Suddenly, on the half-lit stair,"
716,KEN,I think I hardly found a trace
717,KEN,Of likeness to a human face
718,KEN,In his. And I said then
719,KEN,"If in His image God made men,"
720,KEN,Some other must have made poor Ken--
721,KEN,But for his eyes which looked at you
722,KEN,"As two red, wounded stars might do."
723,KEN,
724,KEN,"He scarcely spoke, you scarcely heard,"
725,KEN,His voice broke off in little jars
726,KEN,To tears sometimes. An uncouth bird
727,KEN,"He seemed as he ploughed up the street,"
728,KEN,"Groping, with knarred, high-lifted feet"
729,KEN,And arms thrust out as if to beat
730,KEN,Always against a threat of bars.
731,KEN,
732,KEN,And oftener than not there’d be
733,KEN,A child just higher than his knee
734,KEN,Trotting beside him. Through his dim
735,KEN,"Long twilight this, at least, shone clear,"
736,KEN,"That all the children and the deer,"
737,KEN,Whom every day he went to see
738,KEN,"Out in the park, belonged to him."
739,KEN,
740,KEN,“God help the folk that next him sits
741,KEN,"He fidgets so, with his poor wits.”"
742,KEN,The neighbours said on Sunday nights
743,KEN,When he would go to Church to “see the lights!”
744,KEN,Although for these he used to fix
745,KEN,His eyes upon a crucifix
746,KEN,"In a dark corner, staring on"
747,KEN,Till everybody else had gone.
748,KEN,"And sometimes, in his evil fits,"
749,KEN,You could not move him from his chair--
750,KEN,"You did not look at him as he sat there,"
751,KEN,Biting his rosary to bits.
752,KEN,While pointing to the Christ he tried to say
753,KEN,“Take it away.”
754,KEN,
755,KEN,Nothing was dead:
756,KEN,"He said “a bird” if he picked up a broken wing,"
757,KEN,A perished leaf or any such thing
758,KEN,Was just “a rose”; and once when I had said
759,KEN,"He must not stand and knock there any more,"
760,KEN,He left a twig on the mat outside my door.
761,KEN,
762,KEN,Not long ago
763,KEN,"The last thrush stiffened in the snow,"
764,KEN,While black against a sullen sky
765,KEN,The sighing pines stood by.
766,KEN,But now the wind has left our rattled pane
767,KEN,"To flutter the hedge-sparrow’s wing,"
768,KEN,The birches in the wood are red again
769,KEN,And only yesterday
770,KEN,The larks went up a little way to sing
771,KEN,What lovers say
772,KEN,Who loiter in the lanes to-day;
773,KEN,The buds begin to talk of May
774,KEN,"With learned rooks on city trees,"
775,KEN,And if God please
776,KEN,With all of these
777,KEN,"We too, shall see another Spring."
778,KEN,
779,KEN,But in that red brick barn upon the hill
780,KEN,"I wonder--can one own the deer,"
781,KEN,And does one walk with children still
782,KEN,As one did here--
783,KEN,Do roses grow
784,KEN,Beneath those twenty windows in a row--
785,KEN,And if some night
786,KEN,When you have not seen any light
787,KEN,They cannot move you from your chair
788,KEN,What happens there?
789,KEN,I do not know.
790,KEN,
791,KEN,"So, when they took"
792,KEN,"Ken to that place, I did not look"
793,KEN,After he called and turned on me
794,KEN,His eyes. These I shall see--

822,THE QUIET HOUSE,
823,THE QUIET HOUSE,
824,THE QUIET HOUSE,"When we were children old Nurse used to say,"
825,THE QUIET HOUSE,The house was like an auction or a fair
826,THE QUIET HOUSE,Until the lot of us were safe in bed.
827,THE QUIET HOUSE,It has been quiet as the country-side
828,THE QUIET HOUSE,Since Ted and Janey and then Mother died
829,THE QUIET HOUSE,And Tom crossed Father and was sent away.
830,THE QUIET HOUSE,"After the lawsuit he could not hold up his head,"
831,THE QUIET HOUSE,"Poor Father, and he does not care"
832,THE QUIET HOUSE,"For people here, or to go anywhere."
833,THE QUIET HOUSE,
834,THE QUIET HOUSE,To get away to Aunt’s for that week-end
835,THE QUIET HOUSE,"Was hard enough; (since then, a year ago,"
836,THE QUIET HOUSE,He scarcely lets me slip out of his sight--)
837,THE QUIET HOUSE,"At first I did not like my cousin’s friend,"
838,THE QUIET HOUSE,I did not think I should remember him:
839,THE QUIET HOUSE,"His voice has gone, his face is growing dim"
840,THE QUIET HOUSE,And if I like him now I do not know.
841,THE QUIET HOUSE,He frightened me before he smiled--
842,THE QUIET HOUSE,He did not ask me if he might--
843,THE QUIET HOUSE,"He said that he would come one Sunday night,"
844,THE QUIET HOUSE,He spoke to me as if I were a child.
845,THE QUIET HOUSE,
846,THE QUIET HOUSE,No year has been like this that has just gone by;
847,THE QUIET HOUSE,"It may be that what Father says is true,"
848,THE QUIET HOUSE,If things are so it does not matter why:
849,THE QUIET HOUSE,But everything has burned and not quite through.
850,THE QUIET HOUSE,The colours of the world have turned
851,THE QUIET HOUSE,"To flame, the blue, the gold has burned"
852,THE QUIET HOUSE,In what used to be such a leaden sky.
853,THE QUIET HOUSE,When you are burned quite through you die.
854,THE QUIET HOUSE,
855,THE QUIET HOUSE,Red is the strangest pain to bear;
856,THE QUIET HOUSE,In Spring the leaves on the budding trees;
857,THE QUIET HOUSE,"In Summer the roses are worse than these,"
858,THE QUIET HOUSE,More terrible than they are sweet:
859,THE QUIET HOUSE,A rose can stab you across the street
860,THE QUIET HOUSE,Deeper than any knife:
861,THE QUIET HOUSE,And the crimson haunts you everywhere--
862,THE QUIET HOUSE,"Thin shafts of sunlight, like the ghosts of reddened swords"
863,THE QUIET HOUSE,have struck our stair
864,THE QUIET HOUSE,"As if, coming down, you had spilt your life."
865,THE QUIET HOUSE,
866,THE QUIET HOUSE,I think that my soul is red
867,THE QUIET HOUSE,Like the soul of a sword or a scarlet flower:
868,THE QUIET HOUSE,But when these are dead
869,THE QUIET HOUSE,They have had their hour.
870,THE QUIET HOUSE,
871,THE QUIET HOUSE,"I shall have had mine, too,"
872,THE QUIET HOUSE,"For from head to feet,"
873,THE QUIET HOUSE,"I am burned and stabbed half through,"
874,THE QUIET HOUSE,And the pain is deadly sweet.
875,THE QUIET HOUSE,
876,THE QUIET HOUSE,The things that kill us seem
877,THE QUIET HOUSE,Blind to the death they give:
878,THE QUIET HOUSE,It is only in our dream
879,THE QUIET HOUSE,The things that kill us live.
880,THE QUIET HOUSE,
881,THE QUIET HOUSE,"The room is shut where Mother died,"
882,THE QUIET HOUSE,"The other rooms are as they were,"

885,THE QUIET HOUSE,"The children play as we four did there,"
886,THE QUIET HOUSE,"The trees grow green and brown and bare,"
887,THE QUIET HOUSE,"The sun shines on the dead Church spire,"
888,THE QUIET HOUSE,"And nothing lives here but the fire,"
889,THE QUIET HOUSE,While Father watches from his chair
890,THE QUIET HOUSE,Day follows day
891,THE QUIET HOUSE,"The same, or now and then, a different grey,"
892,THE QUIET HOUSE,"Till, like his hair,"
893,THE QUIET HOUSE,"Which Mother said was wavy once and bright,"
894,THE QUIET HOUSE,They will all turn white.
895,THE QUIET HOUSE,
896,THE QUIET HOUSE,To-night I heard a bell again--
897,THE QUIET HOUSE,"Outside it was the same mist of fine rain,"
898,THE QUIET HOUSE,"The lamps just lighted down the long, dim street,"
899,THE QUIET HOUSE,No one for me--
900,THE QUIET HOUSE,I think it is myself I go to meet:
901,THE QUIET HOUSE,I do not care; some day I _shall_ not think; I shall not _be_!

950,THE FOREST ROAD,"The forest road,"
951,THE FOREST ROAD,The infinite straight road stretching away
952,THE FOREST ROAD,World without end: the breathless road between the walls
953,THE FOREST ROAD,"Of the black listening trees: the hushed, grey road"
954,THE FOREST ROAD,Beyond the window that you shut to-night
955,THE FOREST ROAD,Crying that you would look at it by day--
956,THE FOREST ROAD,There is a shadow there that sings and calls
957,THE FOREST ROAD,But not for you. Oh! hidden eyes that plead in sleep
958,THE FOREST ROAD,"Against the lonely dark, if I could touch the fear"
959,THE FOREST ROAD,And leave it kissed away on quiet lids--
960,THE FOREST ROAD,"If I could hush these hands that are half-awake,"
961,THE FOREST ROAD,Groping for me in sleep I could go free.
962,THE FOREST ROAD,I wish that God would take them out of mine
963,THE FOREST ROAD,And fold them like the wings of frightened birds
964,THE FOREST ROAD,"Shot cruelly down, but fluttering into quietness so soon,"
965,THE FOREST ROAD,"Broken, forgotten things; there is not grief for them in"
966,THE FOREST ROAD,the green Spring
967,THE FOREST ROAD,When the new birds fly back to the old trees.
968,THE FOREST ROAD,But it shall not be so with you. I will look back. I wish I
969,THE FOREST ROAD,knew that God would stand
970,THE FOREST ROAD,"Smiling and looking down on you when morning comes,"
971,THE FOREST ROAD,"To hold you, when you wake, closer than I,"
972,THE FOREST ROAD,So gently though: and not with famished lips or hungry arms:
973,THE FOREST ROAD,"He does not hurt the frailest, dearest things"
974,THE FOREST ROAD,"As we do in the dark. See, dear, your hair--"
975,THE FOREST ROAD,I must unloose this hair that sleeps and dreams
976,THE FOREST ROAD,"About my face, and clings like the brown weed"
977,THE FOREST ROAD,"To drowned, delivered things, tossed by the tired sea"
978,THE FOREST ROAD,Back to the beaches. Oh! your hair! If you had lain
979,THE FOREST ROAD,"A long time dead on the rough, glistening ledge"
980,THE FOREST ROAD,"Of some black cliff, forgotten by the tide,"
981,THE FOREST ROAD,"The raving winds would tear, the dripping brine would rust away"
982,THE FOREST ROAD,Fold after fold of all the loveliness
983,THE FOREST ROAD,"That wraps you round, and makes you, lying here,"
984,THE FOREST ROAD,The passionate fragrance that the roses are.
985,THE FOREST ROAD,But death would spare the glory of your head
986,THE FOREST ROAD,In the long sweetness of the hair that does not die:
987,THE FOREST ROAD,"The spray would leap to it in every storm,"
988,THE FOREST ROAD,The scent of the unsilenced sea would linger on
989,THE FOREST ROAD,"In these dark waves, and round the silence that was you--"
990,THE FOREST ROAD,Only the nesting gulls would hear--but there would still be
991,THE FOREST ROAD,whispers in your hair;
992,THE FOREST ROAD,Keep them for me; keep them for me. What _is_ this singing on
993,THE FOREST ROAD,the road
994,THE FOREST ROAD,That makes all other music like the music in a dream--
995,THE FOREST ROAD,"Dumb to the dancing and the marching feet; you know, in dreams,"
996,THE FOREST ROAD,you see
997,THE FOREST ROAD,"Old pipers playing that you cannot hear,"
998,THE FOREST ROAD,And ghostly drums that only seem to beat. This seems to climb:
999,THE FOREST ROAD,Is it the music of a larger place? It makes our room too small:
1000,THE FOREST ROAD,"it is like a stair,"
1001,THE FOREST ROAD,"A calling stair that climbs up to a smile you scarcely see,"
1002,THE FOREST ROAD,"Dim, but so waited for; and _you_ know what a smile is,"
1003,THE FOREST ROAD,"how it calls,"
1004,THE FOREST ROAD,How if I smiled you always ran to me.
1005,THE FOREST ROAD,"Now you must sleep forgetfully, as children do."
1006,THE FOREST ROAD,There is a Spirit sits by us in sleep
1007,THE FOREST ROAD,Nearer than those who walk with us in the bright day.
1008,THE FOREST ROAD,"I think he has a tranquil, saving face: I think he came"
1009,THE FOREST ROAD,Straight from the hills: he may have suffered there in time
1010,THE FOREST ROAD,"gone by,"
1011,THE FOREST ROAD,"And once, from those forsaken heights, looked down,"
1012,THE FOREST ROAD,"Lonely himself, on all the lonely sorrows of the earth."
1013,THE FOREST ROAD,It is his kingdom--Sleep. If I could leave you there--
1014,THE FOREST ROAD,"If, without waking you, I could get up and reach the door--!"
1015,THE FOREST ROAD,"We used to go together.--Shut, scared eyes,"
1016,THE FOREST ROAD,"Poor, desolate, desperate hands, it is not I"
1017,THE FOREST ROAD,"Who thrust you off. No, take your hands away--"
1018,THE FOREST ROAD,"I cannot strike your lonely hands. Yes, I have struck your heart,"
1019,THE FOREST ROAD,It did not come so near. Then lie you there
1020,THE FOREST ROAD,Dear and wild heart behind this quivering snow
1021,THE FOREST ROAD,With two red stains on it: and I will strike and tear
1022,THE FOREST ROAD,"Mine out, and scatter it to yours. Oh! throbbing dust,"
1023,THE FOREST ROAD,"You that were life, our little wind-blown hearts!"
1024,THE FOREST ROAD,The road! the road!

1063,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"One might put up a monument, I think"
1064,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,To half the world and cut across it “Lost at Sea!”
1065,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"I should drown Jim, poor little sparrow, if I netted him to-night--"
1066,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"No, it’s no use this penny light--"
1067,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Or my poor saint with his tin-pot crown--
1068,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"The trees of Calvary are where they were,"
1069,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,When we are sure that we can spare
1070,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"The tallest, let us go and strike it down"
1071,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,And leave the other two still standing there.
1072,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"I, too, would ask Him to remember me"
1073,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,If there were any Paradise beyond this earth that I could see.
1074,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,
1075,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Oh! quiet Christ who never knew
1076,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,The poisonous fangs that bite us through
1077,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"And make us do the things we do,"
1078,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"See how we suffer and fight and die,"
1079,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"How helpless and how low we lie,"
1080,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"God holds You, and You hang so high,"
1081,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Though no one looking long at You,"
1082,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Can think You do not suffer too,"
1083,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"But, up there, from your still, star-lighted tree"
1084,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"What can You know, what can You really see"
1085,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Of this dark ditch, the soul of me!"
1086,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,
1087,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,We are what we are: when I was half a child I could not sit
1088,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Watching black shadows on green lawns and red carnations burning
1089,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"in the sun,"
1090,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Without paying so heavily for it
1091,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"That joy and pain, like any mother and her unborn child"
1092,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,were almost one.
1093,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,I could hardly bear
1094,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,The dreams upon the eyes of white geraniums in
1095,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"the dusk,"
1096,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"The thick, close voice of musk,"
1097,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"The jessamine music on the thin night air,"
1098,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Or, sometimes, my own hands about me anywhere--"
1099,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,The sight of my own face (for it was lovely then) even the scent
1100,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"of my own hair,"
1101,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Oh! there was nothing, nothing that did not sweep to"
1102,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,the high seat
1103,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Of laughing gods, and then blow down and beat"
1104,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"My soul into the highway dust, as hoofs do the dropped roses of"
1105,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,the street.
1106,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"I think my body was my soul,"
1107,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,And when we are made thus
1108,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Who shall control
1109,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Our hands, our eyes, the wandering passion of"
1110,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"our feet,"
1111,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Who shall teach us
1112,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"To thrust the world out of our heart; to say, till perhaps"
1113,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"in death,"
1114,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"When the race is run,"
1115,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,And it is forced from us with our last breath
1116,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,“Thy will be done”?
1117,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"If it is Your will that we should be content with the tame,"
1118,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,bloodless things.
1119,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"As pale as angels smirking by, with folded wings."
1120,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Oh! I know Virtue, and the peace it brings!"
1121,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"The temperate, well-worn smile"
1122,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"The one man gives you, when you are evermore his own:"
1123,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"And afterwards the child’s, for a little while,"
1124,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,With its unknowing and all-seeing eyes
1125,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"So soon to change, and make you feel how quick"
1126,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,The clock goes round. If one had learned the trick--
1127,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"(How does one though?) quite early on,"
1128,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Of long green pastures under placid skies,"
1129,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,One might be walking now with patient truth.
1130,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"What did we ever care for it, who have asked for youth,"
1131,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"When, oh! my God! this is going or has gone?"
1132,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,
1133,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"There is a portrait of my mother, at nineteen,"
1134,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"With the black spaniel, standing by the garden seat,"
1135,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,The dainty head held high against the painted green
1136,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"And throwing out the youngest smile, shy, but half haughty"
1137,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,and half sweet.
1138,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Her picture then: but simply Youth, or simply Spring"
1139,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"To me to-day: a radiance on the wall,"
1140,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"So exquisite, so heart-breaking a thing"
1141,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Beside the mask that I remember, shrunk and small,"
1142,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Sapless and lined like a dead leaf,"
1143,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"All that was left of oh! the loveliest face, by time and grief!"
1144,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,
1145,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"And in the glass, last night, I saw a ghost behind my chair--"
1146,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Yet why remember it, when one can still go moderately gay--?"
1147,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Or could--with any one of the old crew,"
1148,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,But oh! these boys! the solemn way
1149,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,They take you and the things they say--
1150,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,This “I have only as long as you”
1151,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,When you remind them you are not precisely twenty-two--
1152,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Although at heart perhaps--God! if it were
1153,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Only the face, only the hair!"
1154,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,If Jim had written to me as he did to-day
1155,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,A year ago--and now it leaves me cold--
1156,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"I know what this means, old, old, _old_!"
1157,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"_Et avec ça--mais on a vécu, tout se paie._"
1158,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,
1159,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,That is not always true: there was my Mother--(we at least the
1160,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,dead are free!)
1161,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Yoked to the man that Father was; yoked to the woman I am,"
1162,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Monty too;
1163,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"The little portress at the Convent School, stewing in hell"
1164,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,so patiently;
1165,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"The poor, fair boy who shot himself at Aix. And what of me--and"
1166,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,what of me?
1167,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"But I, I paid for what I had, and they for nothing. No,"
1168,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,one cannot see
1169,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,How it shall be made up to them in some serene eternity.
1170,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,If there were fifty heavens God could not give us back the child
1171,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,who went or never came;
1172,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Here, on our little patch of this great earth, the sun of"
1173,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"any darkened day,"
1174,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Not one of all the starry buds hung on the hawthorn trees of
1175,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"last year’s May,"
1176,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,No shadow from the sloping fields of yesterday;
1177,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"For every hour they slant across the hedge a different way,"
1178,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,The shadows are never the same.
1179,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,
1180,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,“Find rest in Him” One knows the parsons’ tags--
1181,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Back to the fold, across the evening fields, like any flock"
1182,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,of baa-ing sheep:
1183,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Yes, it may be, when He has shorn, led us to slaughter, torn the"
1184,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"bleating soul in us to rags,"
1185,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,For so He giveth His beloved sleep.
1186,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Oh! He will take us stripped and done,"
1187,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Driven into His heart. So we are won:
1188,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Then safe, safe are we? in the shelter of His everlasting"
1189,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,wings--
1190,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"I do not envy Him his victories, His arms are full of broken"
1191,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,things.
1192,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,
1193,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,But I shall not be in them. Let Him take
1194,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"The finer ones, the easier to break."
1195,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"And they are not gone, yet, for me, the lights, the colours,"
1196,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"the perfumes,"
1197,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Though now they speak rather in sumptuous rooms,"
1198,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,In silks and in gem-like wines;
1199,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Here, even, in this corner where my little candle shines"
1200,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,And overhead the lancet-window glows
1201,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,With golds and crimsons you could almost drink
1202,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"To know how jewels taste, just as I used to think"
1203,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,There was the scent in every red and yellow rose
1204,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Of all the sunsets. But this place is grey,"
1205,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"And much too quiet. No one here,"
1206,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Why, this is awful, this is fear!"
1207,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Nothing to see, no face."
1208,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Nothing to hear except your heart beating in space
1209,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,As if the world was ended. Dead at last!
1210,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Dead soul, dead body, tied together fast."
1211,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"These to go on with and alone, to the slow end:"
1212,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"No one to sit with, really, or to speak to, friend to friend:"
1213,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Out of the long procession, black or white or red"
1214,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Not one left now to say “Still I am here, then see you, dear, lay"
1215,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,here your head.”
1216,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Only the doll’s house looking on the Park
1217,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"To-night, all nights, I know, when the man puts the lights"
1218,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"out, very dark."
1219,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"With, upstairs, in the blue and gold box of a room, just the maids’"
1220,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"footsteps overhead,"
1221,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Then utter silence and the empty world--the room--the bed--
1222,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,
1223,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"The corpse! No, not quite dead, while this cries out"
1224,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"in me,"
1225,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,But nearly: very soon to be
1226,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,A handful of forgotten dust--
1227,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"There must be someone. Christ! there must,"
1228,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Tell me there _will_ be someone. Who?
1229,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"If there were no one else, could it be You?"
1230,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,
1231,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,How old was Mary out of whom you cast
1232,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,So many devils? Was she young or perhaps for years
1233,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"She had sat staring, with dry eyes, at this and that man"
1234,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,going past
1235,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Till suddenly she saw You on the steps of Simon’s house
1236,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,And stood and looked at You through tears.
1237,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,I think she must have known by those
1238,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"The thing, for what it was that had come to her."
1239,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"For some of us there is a passion, I suppose"
1240,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,So far from earthly cares and earthly fears
1241,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,That in its stillness you can hardly stir
1242,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Or in its nearness, lift your hand,"
1243,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,So great that you have simply got to stand
1244,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Looking at it through tears, through tears"
1245,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Then straight from these there broke the kiss,"
1246,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,I think You must have known by this
1247,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"The thing, for what it was, that had come to You:"
1248,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"She did not love You like the rest,"
1249,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"It was in her own way, but at the worst, the best,"
1250,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,She gave you something altogether new.
1251,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"And through it all, from her, no word,"
1252,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"She scarcely saw You, scarcely heard:"
1253,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Surely You knew when she so touched You with her hair,"
1254,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Or by the wet cheek lying there,"
1255,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,And while her perfume clung to You from head to feet all through
1256,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,the day
1257,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"That You can change the things for which we care,"
1258,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"But even You, unless You kill us, not the way."
1259,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,
1260,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"This, then was peace for her, but passion too."
1261,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"I wonder was it like a kiss that once I knew,"
1262,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,The only one that I would care to take
1263,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Into the grave with me, to which if there were afterwards,"
1264,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,to wake.
1265,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Almost as happy as the carven dead
1266,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,In some dim chancel lying head by head
1267,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"We slept with it, but face to face, the whole night through--"
1268,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"One breath, one throbbing quietness, as if the thing behind our"
1269,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"lips was endless life,"
1270,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Lost, as I woke, to hear in the strange earthly dawn, his “Are"
1271,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,you there?”
1272,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"And lie still, listening to the wind outside, among"
1273,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,the firs.
1274,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,
1275,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,So Mary chose the dream of Him for what was left to her of
1276,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"night and day,"
1277,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,It is the only truth: it is the dream in us that neither life
1278,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,nor death nor any other thing can take away:
1279,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,But if she had not touched Him in the doorway of the dream
1280,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,could she have cared so much?
1281,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"She was a sinner, we are what we are: the spirit afterwards,"
1282,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"but first, the touch."
1283,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,
1284,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,And He has never shared with me my haunted house beneath
1285,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,the trees
1286,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Of Eden and Calvary, with its ghosts that have not any eyes"
1287,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"for tears,"
1288,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"And the happier guests who would not see, or if they did,"
1289,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"remember these,"
1290,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Though they lived there a thousand years.
1291,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Outside, too gravely looking at me, He seems to stand,"
1292,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"And looking at Him, if my forgotten spirit came"
1293,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Unwillingly back, what could it claim"
1294,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Of those calm eyes, that quiet speech,"
1295,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Breaking like a slow tide upon the beach,"
1296,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"The scarred, not quite human hand?--"
1297,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,Unwillingly back to the burden of old imaginings
1298,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"When it has learned so long not to think, not to be,"
1299,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Again, again it would speak as it has spoken to me of things"
1300,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,That I shall not see!
1301,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,
1302,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,I cannot bear to look at this divinely bent and gracious head:
1303,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,When I was small I never quite believed that He was dead:
1304,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,And at the Convent school I used to lie awake in bed
1305,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Thinking about His hands. It did not matter what they said,"
1306,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"He was alive to me, so hurt, so hurt! And most of all in Holy Week"
1307,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,When there was no one else to see
1308,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"I used to think it would not hurt me too, so terribly,"
1309,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,If He had ever seemed to notice me
1310,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,"Or, if, for once, He would only speak."
1311,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,
1312,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,
1313,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,
1314,MADELEINE IN CHURCH,
1315,EXSPECTO RESURRECTIONEM,EXSPECTO RESURRECTIONEM
1316,EXSPECTO RESURRECTIONEM,
1317,EXSPECTO RESURRECTIONEM,
1318,EXSPECTO RESURRECTIONEM,Oh! King who hast the key
1319,EXSPECTO RESURRECTIONEM,"Of that dark room,"
1320,EXSPECTO RESURRECTIONEM,"The last which prisons us but held not Thee,"
1321,EXSPECTO RESURRECTIONEM,Thou know’st its gloom.
1322,EXSPECTO RESURRECTIONEM,Dost Thou a little love this one
1323,EXSPECTO RESURRECTIONEM,"Shut in to-night,"
1324,EXSPECTO RESURRECTIONEM,"Young and so piteously alone,"
1325,EXSPECTO RESURRECTIONEM,Cold--out of sight?
1326,EXSPECTO RESURRECTIONEM,Thou know’st how hard and bare
1327,EXSPECTO RESURRECTIONEM,"The pillow of that new-made narrow bed,"
1328,EXSPECTO RESURRECTIONEM,Then leave not there
1329,EXSPECTO RESURRECTIONEM,So dear a head!

1334,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA
1335,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,
1336,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,
1337,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"We passed each other, turned and stopped for half an hour,"
1338,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"then went our way,"
1339,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,I who make other women smile did not make you--
1340,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,But no man can move mountains in a day.
1341,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,So this hard thing is yet to do.
1342,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,
1343,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,But first I want your life:--before I die I want to see
1344,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"The world that lies behind the strangeness of your eyes,"
1345,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"There is nothing gay or green there for my gathering, it may be,"
1346,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,Yet on brown fields there lies
1347,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,A haunting purple bloom: is there not something in grey skies
1348,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,And in grey sea?
1349,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"I want what world there is behind your eyes,"
1350,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,I want your life and you will not give it to me.
1351,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,
1352,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"Now, if I look, I see you walking down the years,"
1353,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"Young, and through August fields--a face, a thought,"
1354,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,a swinging dream perched on a stile--;
1355,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,I would have liked (so vile we are!) to have taught you tears
1356,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,But most to have made you smile.
1357,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,
1358,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,To-day is not enough or yesterday: God sees it all--
1359,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"Your length on sunny lawns, the wakeful rainy nights--; tell me--;"
1360,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"(how vain to ask),"
1361,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,but it is not a question--just a call--;
1362,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"Show me then, only your notched inches climbing up the garden wall,"
1363,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,I like you best when you were small.
1364,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,
1365,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,Is this a stupid thing to say
1366,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,Not having spent with you one day?
1367,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,No matter; I shall never touch your hair
1368,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,Or hear the little tick behind your breast.
1369,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"Still it is there,"
1370,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,And as a flying bird
1371,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,Brushes the branches where it may not rest
1372,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,I have brushed your hand and heard
1373,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,The child in you: I like that best
1374,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,
1375,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"So small, so dark, so sweet; and were you also then too grave"
1376,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,and wise?
1377,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,Always I think. Then put your far off little hand in
1378,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,mine;--Oh! let it rest;
1379,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"I will not stare into the early world beyond the opening eyes,"
1380,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,Or vex or scare what I love best.
1381,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,But I want your life before mine bleeds away--
1382,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"Here--not in heavenly hereafters--soon,--"
1383,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"I want your smile this very afternoon,"
1384,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"(The last of all my vices, pleasant people used to say,"
1385,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,I wanted and I sometimes got--the Moon!)
1386,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,
1387,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"You know, at dusk, the last bird’s cry,"
1388,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"And round the house the flap of the bat’s low flight,"
1389,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,Trees that go black against the sky
1390,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,And then--how soon the night!
1391,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,
1392,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"No shadow of you on any bright road again,"
1393,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,And at the darkening end of this--what voice? whose kiss? As if
1394,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,you’d say!
1395,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"It is not I who have walked with you, it will not be I who take away"
1396,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"Peace, peace, my little handful of the gleaner’s grain"
1397,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,From your reaped fields at the shut of day.
1398,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,
1399,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,Peace! Would you not rather die
1400,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"Reeling,--with all the cannons at your ear?"
1401,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"So, at least, would I,"
1402,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,And I may not be here
1403,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"To-night, to-morrow morning or next year."
1404,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,"Still I will let you keep your life a little while,"
1405,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,See dear?
1406,ON THE ROAD TO THE SEA,_I have made you smile._

1415,THE SUNLIT HOUSE,In shuttered sunshine: the parched garden flowers
1416,THE SUNLIT HOUSE,"Their fallen petals from the beds unswept,"
1417,THE SUNLIT HOUSE,Like children unloved and ill-kept
1418,THE SUNLIT HOUSE,Dreamed through the hours.
1419,THE SUNLIT HOUSE,"Two blue hydrangeas by the blistered door, burned brown,"
1420,THE SUNLIT HOUSE,Watched there and no one in the town
1421,THE SUNLIT HOUSE,"Cared to go past it night or day,"
1422,THE SUNLIT HOUSE,Though why this was they wouldn’t say.
1423,THE SUNLIT HOUSE,"But, I the stranger, knew that I must stay,"
1424,THE SUNLIT HOUSE,"Pace up the weed-grown paths and down,"
1425,THE SUNLIT HOUSE,Till one afternoon--there is just a doubt--
1426,THE SUNLIT HOUSE,But I fancy I heard a tiny shout--
1427,THE SUNLIT HOUSE,From an upper window a bird flew out--
1428,THE SUNLIT HOUSE,And I went my way.

1438,THE SHADE-CATCHERS,Catching bits of shade in the sunny street:
1439,THE SHADE-CATCHERS,"“I’ve got one,” cried sister to brother."
1440,THE SHADE-CATCHERS,“I’ve got two.” “Now I’ve got another.”
