45,_PREFACE_,
46,_PREFACE_,"_If the existence and contents of this book require any explanation,"
47,_PREFACE_,the compiler may adopt the words of a famous defender of poetry:_
48,_PREFACE_,
49,_PREFACE_,"_""Hee doth not onely shew the way but giveth so sweet a prospect"
50,_PREFACE_,into the way as will entice anie man into it._
51,_PREFACE_,
52,_PREFACE_,"_""Nay, hee doth as if your journey should lye through a faire"
53,_PREFACE_,"Vineyard, at the verie first give you a cluster of Grapes that"
54,_PREFACE_,full of that taste you may long to passe further. He beginneth
55,_PREFACE_,"not with obscure definitions, which must blurre the margent with"
56,_PREFACE_,"interpretations and loade the memorie with doubtfulnesse, but hee"
57,_PREFACE_,"cometh to you with words set in delightful proportion, either"
58,_PREFACE_,accompanied with or prepared for the well-enchanting skill of
59,_PREFACE_,"musicke, and with a tale forsoothe he cometh unto you, with a"
60,_PREFACE_,tale which holdeth children from play and olde men from the
61,_PREFACE_,"chimney-corner, and pretending no more, doth intend the winning"
62,_PREFACE_,"of the minde from wickedness to vertue.""_"
63,_PREFACE_,
64,_PREFACE_,_These excellent words of Sir Philip Sidney give the reason and scope of
65,_PREFACE_,this collection of examples of the poetry of the present century. No
66,_PREFACE_,attempt at arbitrary classification or labelling has been made; it is
67,_PREFACE_,"not intended to show that any poet, deliberately or otherwise, is a"
68,_PREFACE_,Neo-Symbolist or Paroxyst or is afflicted with any other 'ist or 'ism;
69,_PREFACE_,it is not compiled to assert that any one group of poets is superior to
70,_PREFACE_,any other group of poets or to poets who had the misfortune to have
71,_PREFACE_,their corporeal existence cut short before the dawn of the twentieth
72,_PREFACE_,century; it is not even intended to prove that good poetry is written in
73,_PREFACE_,our time. All such purposes and particularly the latter are superfluous
74,_PREFACE_,and may be left to dogmatic disputants who have little care for the
75,_PREFACE_,grace and harmony of poetry._
76,_PREFACE_,
77,_PREFACE_,_The scheme of the Anthology is simple and without guile. It does not
78,_PREFACE_,"presuppose an abrupt period, but for the sake of convenience and in"
79,_PREFACE_,justification of its existence includes only the work of living writers
80,_PREFACE_,produced during the present century and therefore most likely to be
81,_PREFACE_,representative of the poetry of to-day. No editorial credit can be
82,_PREFACE_,claimed for the selections; they are not the reflex of one individual's
83,_PREFACE_,"taste and preferences, but have been made by the writers themselves, to"
84,_PREFACE_,whom--and their respective publishers--for their cordial co-operation
85,_PREFACE_,"the collator of this distinctive volume is exceedingly grateful, not on"
86,_PREFACE_,his own account only but also on behalf of those readers to whom this
87,_PREFACE_,volume will open out so fair a prospect that they will long to pass
88,_PREFACE_,"further, this ""cluster of grapes"" being one of the ""lures immortal"" for"
89,_PREFACE_,the rapidly increasing number of discriminating lovers of the high
90,_PREFACE_,poetry that is the touchstone of beauty. The finest lyric work of our
91,_PREFACE_,day needs no further introduction; the poet is his own best interpreter;
92,_PREFACE_,"but it may be added, in anticipation of adventitious criticism of the"
93,_PREFACE_,"limitations of these examples, that the capacity of the present volume"
94,_PREFACE_,and the absence abroad of some potential contributors account for the
95,_PREFACE_,non-inclusion of certain writers who otherwise would have been
96,_PREFACE_,represented here._

1616,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,Uncurved canals where barges ply;
1617,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,A hundred hamlets all alike;
1618,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1619,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,Flat fields that cut an arc of sky
1620,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,With men and women o'er them bent
1621,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,Who needs must labour lest they die.
1622,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1623,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,Would any say that lives so spent
1624,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"Might break, spurred on by love and pride,"

1626,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1627,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"Nay, here live men unvexed, untried--"
1628,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,I mused. Yet pacing Roosevelt street
1629,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,In idle humour I espied
1630,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1631,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"A village man and woman meet,"
1632,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,And pass with never word or sign--
1633,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,So strange in neighbour-folk whose feet
1634,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1635,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,Haunt the same fields in rain and shine
1636,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"That, curious eyed, in either face,"
1637,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"In curve of lip, or graven line,"
1638,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,

1640,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"Of harsh resolve, and so grew ware"
1641,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,That hers was as a hiding place
1642,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1643,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,Where lurked the kinship of despair;
1644,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,While his bore record deeply wrought
1645,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"That life for him had but one care,"
1646,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1647,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,And that--to mesh re-iterant thought
1648,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"In labour, till at last his soul"
1649,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,Should find the anodyne it sought.
1650,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1651,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,Hence now with dreary face he stole
1652,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"Through Roosevelt Street, nor stretched his hand"
1653,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,To beg from life its smallest dole.
1654,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1655,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,And yet these two had loved and planned
1656,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"To happiest end, but for the flood"
1657,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"That wrecks, upreared on rock or sand,"
1658,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1659,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"The house of hopes. Thus--cold of mood,"
1660,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"He, loving wholly, could but choose"
1661,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,To deem her heart as his subdued;
1662,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1663,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"While she, as maidens oft-times use,"
1664,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"Denied sweet proofs of love, was fain"
1665,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,To gain them by the world-old ruse;
1666,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1667,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"And failing, vexed to find that vain"
1668,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"Was all her pretty reticence,"
1669,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,She happed upon a worthless swain
1670,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1671,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"On whom, reserved the gold, the pence"
1672,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"Of liberal smiles she flung away,"
1673,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"Till, snared by her own innocence,"
1674,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1675,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"She fell--Ah, God! how far that day"
1676,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"She fell--from hope and promise plumb,"
1677,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,To deeps where lips forget to pray.
1678,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1679,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"But he, apart, with sorrow dumb,"
1680,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"Beheld, scarce conscious of the strife,"
1681,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,Himself in her by fate o'ercome;
1682,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1683,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"And as she passed to her new life,"
1684,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"Righted by still more wrong, divined"
1685,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"Her hate for him who called her wife,"
1686,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1687,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,And on the hoarded knowledge pined
1688,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"And starved, till he, as she, was dead,"
1689,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,And nought remained but to unwind
1690,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1691,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,His coil of days. So with slow tread
1692,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,He goes his way through Roosevelt Street
1693,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"At night and morn, nor turns his head"
1694,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1695,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,When past him comes the sound of feet--
1696,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,Of ghostly feet that long ago
1697,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,In life had made his pulses beat.
1698,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1699,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"For, mark you, both are dead, and so"

1701,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"Betwixt them in the street, I trow."
1702,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1703,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,Yet still they move with that huge mass

1705,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"The corn in season, mows the grass,"
1706,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1707,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,And then by right of labour sleeps
1708,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,With privilege of dreams that ape
1709,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"Fulfilment, whereby each may creep"
1710,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,
1711,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,From pain through doors of dear escape;
1712,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"Save such, unhappy, as would win"
1713,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,"Some respite for themselves, and shape"
1714,ROOSEVELT-VILLAGE STREET,

1742,THE HAUNTED FIELDS,
1743,THE HAUNTED FIELDS,"At others, on an impulse waxing brave,"
1744,THE HAUNTED FIELDS,They climb the churchyard wall
1745,THE HAUNTED FIELDS,"And, marvelling at it all,"
1746,THE HAUNTED FIELDS,See strange black people gathered round a grave.
1747,THE HAUNTED FIELDS,
1748,THE HAUNTED FIELDS,"Then, without question, hurrying up the lane,"
1749,THE HAUNTED FIELDS,They seek once more their own--

2267,THE CROSSING SWORDS,
2268,THE CROSSING SWORDS,--They closed. Above them the driving mists
2269,THE CROSSING SWORDS,Stooped and feathered--and hid the lists.

2271,THE CROSSING SWORDS,But dead in his harness the Green Knight lay.

2809,THE CHANGELING,
2810,THE CHANGELING,When did the Changeling enter in?
2811,THE CHANGELING,How did the Devil set him a gin
2812,THE CHANGELING,Where the little soul lay like a rabbit
2813,THE CHANGELING,Faint and still for a fiend to grab it?
2814,THE CHANGELING,I know not.
2815,THE CHANGELING,
2816,THE CHANGELING,Where was the fount of our dishonour?
2817,THE CHANGELING,Was it a father's buried sin?
2818,THE CHANGELING,Brought his mother a curse upon her?
2819,THE CHANGELING,I trow not.
2820,THE CHANGELING,
2821,THE CHANGELING,So pretty
2822,THE CHANGELING,"Body and soul, the child began."
2823,THE CHANGELING,"He carolled and kissed and laughed and ran,"
2824,THE CHANGELING,"A glad creature of Earth and Heaven,"
2825,THE CHANGELING,"And the knowledge of love and the secret of pity,"
2826,THE CHANGELING,"That need our learning,"
2827,THE CHANGELING,God to him at his birth had given.
2828,THE CHANGELING,
2829,THE CHANGELING,One remembers
2830,THE CHANGELING,Trifles indeed--the backward-turning
2831,THE CHANGELING,Way he would smile from the field at play.
2832,THE CHANGELING,Sometimes the Thing that sits by the embers
2833,THE CHANGELING,Smiles at me--devil!--the selfsame way.
2834,THE CHANGELING,"If only early enough one had guessed,"
2835,THE CHANGELING,"Known, suspected, watched him at rest,"
2836,THE CHANGELING,"Noted the Master's sign and fashion,"
2837,THE CHANGELING,"And unbefooled by the heart's compassion,"
2838,THE CHANGELING,"Undeterred by form and feature,"
2839,THE CHANGELING,"Caught the creature,"
2840,THE CHANGELING,"Tried by the test of water and fire,"
2841,THE CHANGELING,"Pierced and pinioned with silver wire,"
2842,THE CHANGELING,"Circled with signs that could control,"
2843,THE CHANGELING,Battered with spells that tame and torture
2844,THE CHANGELING,"The demon nature,"
2845,THE CHANGELING,"Till he writhed in his shape, a fiend confest,"
2846,THE CHANGELING,And vanished--
2847,THE CHANGELING,"Then had come back, the poor soul banished,"
2848,THE CHANGELING,Then had come back the little soul.
2849,THE CHANGELING,But now there is nothing to do or to say.
2850,THE CHANGELING,"Will no one grip him and tear him away,"
2851,THE CHANGELING,The Thing of Blood that gnaws at my breast?
2852,THE CHANGELING,
2853,THE CHANGELING,Perhaps he called me and I was dumb.
2854,THE CHANGELING,Unconcerned I sat and heard
2855,THE CHANGELING,"Little things,"
2856,THE CHANGELING,"Ivy tendrils, a bird's wings,"
2857,THE CHANGELING,A frightened bird--
2858,THE CHANGELING,Or faint hands at the window-pane?
2859,THE CHANGELING,"And now he will never come again,"
2860,THE CHANGELING,The little soul. He is quite lost.
2861,THE CHANGELING,
2862,THE CHANGELING,I have summoned him back with incantations
2863,THE CHANGELING,"Of heart-deep sobs and whispering cries,"
2864,THE CHANGELING,"Of anguished love and travail of prayer,"
2865,THE CHANGELING,Nothing has answered my despair
2866,THE CHANGELING,But long sighs
2867,THE CHANGELING,Of pitiful wind in the fir-plantations.
2868,THE CHANGELING,Poor little soul! He cannot come.
2869,THE CHANGELING,"Perchance on a night when trees were tost,"
2870,THE CHANGELING,The Changeling rode with his cavalcade
2871,THE CHANGELING,"Among the clouds, that were tossing too,"
2872,THE CHANGELING,And made the little soul afraid.
2873,THE CHANGELING,"They hunted him madly, the howling crew,"
2874,THE CHANGELING,"Into the Limbo of the lost,"
2875,THE CHANGELING,Into the Limbo of the others
2876,THE CHANGELING,Who wander crying and calling their mothers.
2877,THE CHANGELING,
2878,THE CHANGELING,Now I know
2879,THE CHANGELING,The creatures that come to harry and raid
2880,THE CHANGELING,"How they ride in the airy regions,"
2881,THE CHANGELING,"Dance their rounds on meadow and moor,"
2882,THE CHANGELING,"Gallop under the earth in legions,"
2883,THE CHANGELING,Hunt and holloa and run their races
2884,THE CHANGELING,Over tombs in burial-places.
2885,THE CHANGELING,
2886,THE CHANGELING,"In the common roads where people go,"
2887,THE CHANGELING,"Masked and mingled with human traces,"
2888,THE CHANGELING,"I have marked, I who know,"
2889,THE CHANGELING,In the common dust a devil's spoor.
2890,THE CHANGELING,
2891,THE CHANGELING,To somebody's gate
2892,THE CHANGELING,"A Thing is footing it, cares not much"
2893,THE CHANGELING,Whether he creep through an Emperor's portal
2894,THE CHANGELING,And steal the fate
2895,THE CHANGELING,"Of a Prince, or into a poor man's hutch--"
2896,THE CHANGELING,For the grief will be everywhere as great
2897,THE CHANGELING,And he'll everywhere spread the smirch of sin--
2898,THE CHANGELING,"So long as a taste of our blood he may win,"
2899,THE CHANGELING,So long as he may become a mortal.
2900,THE CHANGELING,
2901,THE CHANGELING,"I beseech you,"
2902,THE CHANGELING,"Prince and poor man, to watch the gate."
2903,THE CHANGELING,"The heart is poisoned where he has fed,"
2904,THE CHANGELING,The house is ruined that lets him in.
2905,THE CHANGELING,Yet I know I shall never teach you.
2906,THE CHANGELING,With the voice of the dear and the eyes of the dead
2907,THE CHANGELING,"He will come to the door, and you'll let him in."
2908,THE CHANGELING,
2909,THE CHANGELING,If I could forget
2910,THE CHANGELING,"Only that ever I had a child,"
2911,THE CHANGELING,"If only upon some mirk midnight,"
2912,THE CHANGELING,"When he stands at the door, all wet and wild,"
2913,THE CHANGELING,"With his owl's feather and dripping hair,"
2914,THE CHANGELING,"I could lie warm and not care,"
2915,THE CHANGELING,I should rid myself of this Changeling yet.
2916,THE CHANGELING,
2917,THE CHANGELING,"I carried my woe to the Wise Man yonder,"
2918,THE CHANGELING,"""You sell forgetfulness, they say."
2919,THE CHANGELING,How much to pay
2920,THE CHANGELING,"To forget a son who is my sorrow?"""
2921,THE CHANGELING,
2922,THE CHANGELING,The Wise Man began to ponder.
2923,THE CHANGELING,"""Charms have I, many a one,"
2924,THE CHANGELING,"To make a woman forget her lover,"
2925,THE CHANGELING,"A man his wife or a fortune fled,"
2926,THE CHANGELING,"To make the day forget the morrow,"
2927,THE CHANGELING,"The doer forget the deed he has done,"
2928,THE CHANGELING,But a mighty spell must I borrow
2929,THE CHANGELING,"To make a woman forget her son,"
2930,THE CHANGELING,For this I will take a royal fee.
2931,THE CHANGELING,"Your house,"" said he,"
2932,THE CHANGELING,"""The storied hangings richly cover,"
2933,THE CHANGELING,On your banquet table there were six
2934,THE CHANGELING,"Golden branched candlesticks,"
2935,THE CHANGELING,And of noble dishes you had a score.
2936,THE CHANGELING,The crown you wore
2937,THE CHANGELING,"I remember, the sparkling crown."
2938,THE CHANGELING,"All of these,"
2939,THE CHANGELING,"Madam, you shall pay me down."
2940,THE CHANGELING,Also the day I give you ease
2941,THE CHANGELING,"Of golden guineas you pay a hundred."""
2942,THE CHANGELING,
2943,THE CHANGELING,Laughing I left the Wise Man's door.
2944,THE CHANGELING,Has he found such things where a Changeling sits?
2945,THE CHANGELING,"The home is darkened from roof to floor,"
2946,THE CHANGELING,The house is naked and ravaged and plundered
2947,THE CHANGELING,Where a Changling sits
2948,THE CHANGELING,"On the hearthstone, warming his shivering fits."
2949,THE CHANGELING,
2950,THE CHANGELING,"He sits at his ease, for he knows well"
2951,THE CHANGELING,He can keep his post.
2952,THE CHANGELING,He has left me nothing to pay the cost
2953,THE CHANGELING,Of snatching my heart from his private Hell.
2954,THE CHANGELING,
2955,THE CHANGELING,Yet when all is done and told
2956,THE CHANGELING,I am glad the Wise Man in the City
2957,THE CHANGELING,Had no pity
2958,THE CHANGELING,"For me, and for him I had no gold."
2959,THE CHANGELING,
2960,THE CHANGELING,"Because if I did not remember him,"
2961,THE CHANGELING,"My little child--Ah! What should we have,"
2962,THE CHANGELING,He and I? Not even a grave
2963,THE CHANGELING,With a name of his own by the river's brim.
2964,THE CHANGELING,"Because if among the poppies gay,"
2965,THE CHANGELING,"On the hill-side, now my eyes are dim,"
2966,THE CHANGELING,"I could not fancy a child at play,"
2967,THE CHANGELING,And if I should pass by the pool in the quarry
2968,THE CHANGELING,"And never see him, a darling ghost,"
2969,THE CHANGELING,"Sailing a boat there, I should be sorry--"
2970,THE CHANGELING,"If in the firelit, lone December"
2971,THE CHANGELING,I never heard him come scampering post
2972,THE CHANGELING,Haste down the stair--if the soul that is lost
2973,THE CHANGELING,"Came back, and I did not remember."
