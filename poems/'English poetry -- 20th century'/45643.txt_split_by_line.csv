313,ROCKETS AND ASHES,But the lock is jarred with rust.
314,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"The sun looks in through the window,"
315,ROCKETS AND ASHES,But its closed shutters are as blinded eyes.
316,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Our souls are full of dead and beautiful things
317,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Like bowls of potpourri,"
318,ROCKETS AND ASHES,A dust of petals
319,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Rustling through the tired fingers of a ghost.

326,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"From far away the lost adventures gleam,"
327,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"The print of childhood's feet that dance and run,"
328,ROCKETS AND ASHES,The love of her who showed me to the sun
329,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"In triumph of creation, who did seem"
330,ROCKETS AND ASHES,With vivid spirit like a rainbow stream
331,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"To paint the shells, young blossoms, one by one"
332,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Each strange and delicate toy, whose hands have spun"
333,ROCKETS AND ASHES,The woven cloth of wonder like a dream ...
334,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"The row of soldiered books, authority"
335,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Sharp as the scales I strummed upon the keys,"
336,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"The priest who damned the things I dared not praise,"
337,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Rebellion, love made sad with mystery--"

348,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Against the army of infuriated pride,"
349,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Against the shields of reason, and the spears"
350,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Of savage moments, sharp-edged bitterness;"
351,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Against the blazoned armour of intolerance,"

353,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
354,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Love, Humour, and Rebellion, go with me,"
355,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Three musketeers of faithful following.
356,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"We will fear nothing.--Is not laughter brave,"
357,ROCKETS AND ASHES,That unconcerned goes rippling through despair?
358,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Is not rebellion brave, that fiercely moves"
359,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Against the buttressed prisons of the world?
360,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"And is not love the bravest of them all,"
361,ROCKETS AND ASHES,So frail to hold his white hands up to Heaven
362,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"While the red fists are threatening all around,"
363,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And hate is beating on the battledrums?
364,ROCKETS AND ASHES,As d'Artagnan upon a starved grey horse
365,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Goes singing ballads on adventurous roads,"
366,ROCKETS AND ASHES,I ride my fancy blithely into danger

377,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Merged with the thud of feet forever dallying indifferent and
378,ROCKETS AND ASHES,indefinite along.
379,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"The houses stood like rows of cripples, some paralysed, some"
380,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"hunch-backed and some bent with age,"
381,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"They seemed at war, their chimneys threatening, their brows hung"
382,ROCKETS AND ASHES,heavy in a sombre rage.
383,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Crab-like the children crawled, while always hammering above their"
384,ROCKETS AND ASHES,heads the scolding shrewish tongue;
385,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"They grew as bloodless flowers unflourishing, waxen and pale from out"
386,ROCKETS AND ASHES,the dust and dung.
387,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Above I saw the strip of sunset fluttering, even as washed-out rags"
388,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"upon the line,"
389,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"I listened to the sparrows twittering, and the hours ticking in a"
390,ROCKETS AND ASHES,slow decline.
391,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Then beaded on the hem of evening, the coloured lights were threaded"
392,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"here and there,"
393,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Till proud with sweets and plumes and oranges, the shops grew"
394,ROCKETS AND ASHES,brilliant in the tinsel glare.
395,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Grey was the death-bed of the twilight, shuddering the faint hands of"
396,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"the day stretched to the night,"
397,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Fending it off, or feebly wavering over the pallid glints of stolen"
398,ROCKETS AND ASHES,light.
399,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And grey the faces that were gathering among the fallen ashes of the
400,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"day,"
401,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"And red the faces, yellow, flickering, under the lamps upon the long"
402,ROCKETS AND ASHES,highway.
403,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"And some were gashed with smiles, and quaint grimaces of hate and"
404,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"pain and hunger and despair,"
405,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"And some wore coloured hats and meek frivolities, limp ribbons, and"
406,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"false pansies in their hair,"
407,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"But all were cold, and all seemed passionless; there shone no zest or"
408,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"splendour in their lives,"
409,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Nor hope in anything but holidays, or watching funerals, or taking"
410,ROCKETS AND ASHES,wives.
411,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"I dared not think, for truth rose horrible, slapping the face with"
412,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"coarse uncaring hand,"
413,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"But like them cheated into merriment, I wilfully refused to"
414,ROCKETS AND ASHES,understand;
415,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Turned me away from wan-eyed poverty, trod pity underfoot, oh, danced"
416,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"on grief,"
417,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Bade the crowd sing and fill my desolation, bade them be glad and"
418,ROCKETS AND ASHES,hide my disbelief.
419,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
420,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Strange we so love the world--for presently, out of my window looking"
421,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"on the city,"
422,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"I blessed the night, and the roofs slumbering all huddled, and I felt"
423,ROCKETS AND ASHES,no shame nor pity
424,ROCKETS AND ASHES,For all our dusty days of journeying amid the wreck and ruins of our
425,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"dreams,"
426,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Meandering in a bleared forgetfulness, where lethe laps the wharf of"
427,ROCKETS AND ASHES,sleeping streams.
428,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"I only breathed the air, intensified by the ascending breath of"
429,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"million lungs,"
430,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"And heard the labouring metropolis, quickened by whispers of a"
431,ROCKETS AND ASHES,million tongues;
432,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"And felt a king of splendid loneliness, and felt an atom of the"
433,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"peopled spaces,"
434,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"And felt again my lordly egoism, one face distinct among the blur of"
435,ROCKETS AND ASHES,faces.

445,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Calm of the marble-terraced night
446,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Charred with the spattering of rockets.
447,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
448,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Drums will I hear and battles now,"
449,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"And the long death howl of wolves by night,"
450,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Watching the moon on the forest tops,"
451,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Walking with delicate frightened steps
452,ROCKETS AND ASHES,To the slaughter-house of a red sunrise.

456,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
457,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
458,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
459,ROCKETS AND ASHES,I could explain
460,ROCKETS AND ASHES,The complicated lore that drags the soul
461,ROCKETS AND ASHES,From what shall profit him
462,ROCKETS AND ASHES,To gild damnation with his choicest gold.
463,ROCKETS AND ASHES,But you
464,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Are poring over precious books and do not hear
465,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Our plaintive, frivolous songs;"
466,ROCKETS AND ASHES,For we in stubborn vanity ascend
467,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"On ladders insecure,"
468,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Toward the tottering balconies
469,ROCKETS AND ASHES,To serenade our painted paramours;
470,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Caught by the lure of dangerous pale hands,"
471,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Oblivion's heavy lids on sleepless eyes
472,ROCKETS AND ASHES,That cheat between unrest and false repose.
473,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And we are haunted
474,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"By spectral Joy once murdered in a rage,"
475,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Now taking shape of Pleasure,"
476,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Disguised in many clothes and skilful masks.
477,ROCKETS AND ASHES,I could disclose
478,ROCKETS AND ASHES,The truth that hangs between our lies
479,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And jostles sleep to semi-consciousness;
480,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Truth, that stings like nettles"
481,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Our frail hands dare not pluck
482,ROCKETS AND ASHES,From out our garden's terraced indolence.
483,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"We are not happy,"
484,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And you make us dumb with loving hands
485,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Reproachful on our lips.
486,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Nor can we sob our sorrows on your breast,"
487,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"For we have bartered diamonds for glass,"
488,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Our tears for smiles,"
489,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Eternity for now.

493,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
494,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
495,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
496,ROCKETS AND ASHES,I feel in me a manifold desire
497,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"From many lands and times and clamouring peoples,"
498,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And I the Queen
499,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Of crowding vagabonds,"
500,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Ghosts of lost years in seeming fancy dress,"
501,ROCKETS AND ASHES,With pathos of torn laces
502,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And broken swords;
503,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Cut-throats and kings and poets
504,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Who have loved me
505,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"In visions wild, not knowing"
506,ROCKETS AND ASHES,What I was.
507,ROCKETS AND ASHES,In me no end
508,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Even where the last content
509,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Clasps on my head a crown
510,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Of shining endurance--
511,ROCKETS AND ASHES,I slip from all my robes
512,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Into the rags of a tattered romance;
513,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"The stars crowd at the window,"
514,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Their jealous destiny
515,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Raps at the door--
516,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"They bob and wink and leer,"
517,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And I must leave the lamplight for the road
518,ROCKETS AND ASHES,To keep strange company.

526,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Silence--
527,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Somewhere on earth
528,ROCKETS AND ASHES,There is a purpose that I miss or have forgotten.
529,ROCKETS AND ASHES,The trees stand bolt upright
530,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Like roofless pillars of a broken temple.
531,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"There is a purpose in Heaven,"
532,ROCKETS AND ASHES,But for me
533,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Nothing.

537,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
538,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
539,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
540,ROCKETS AND ASHES,I should like to say to the world:
541,ROCKETS AND ASHES,I have launched my soul like a ship upon free waters;
542,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Beautiful she stands in the docks with proud masts cutting
543,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"the sky,"
544,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Perfectly poised, her white sails spreading like wings,"
545,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Her figurehead a woman with breasts that daunt the spray,"
546,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Her flag a flutter of coloured exuberance.
547,ROCKETS AND ASHES,I should like to see her plunging out of the idle harbour
548,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Where the sulky tide drifts scum, and the sailors wrangle and"
549,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"shout,"
550,ROCKETS AND ASHES,In a thunder of churning waves ramping before her like dappled
551,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"stallions,"
552,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Blossoming behind her a field of etiolate lilies....
553,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
554,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"But to the mimicking, plotting, miserly, cynical,"
555,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"To the rabble and gabble that dance and kill on the quay,"
556,ROCKETS AND ASHES,I can only say that my soul is a sleeping gondola
557,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Lulled by a jester's mandolin, till night is atinkle with tunes"
558,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"And lantern-lights, along the indolent backwaters."
559,ROCKETS AND ASHES,

561,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
562,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
563,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
564,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
565,ROCKETS AND ASHES,You pass as in a drugged delirium
566,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Wrought strange upon the mind's distraction;
567,ROCKETS AND ASHES,You sing a blasphemous Te Deum
568,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"To harlot virgins, and a fraction"
569,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Of your fulginous colour passes,"
570,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Stains my spirit's great conception
571,ROCKETS AND ASHES,As it dips into your glasses.
572,ROCKETS AND ASHES,I that am the sole exception
573,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"To your stillborn, false devices,"
574,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"I that know you, I that hate you,"
575,ROCKETS AND ASHES,I that drank now spit your vices
576,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Through my loathing reinstate you;
577,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Dive once more into the stagnance,"
578,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Kiss your cynic lips and drink you,"
579,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Concentrate your cruel fragrance,"
580,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Steal your flowers before I sink you,"
581,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Lift with hate instead of praises,"
582,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Show you honour of my scorning,"
583,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Garlanded you go to blazes
584,ROCKETS AND ASHES,With my rhymes for your adorning!
585,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
586,ROCKETS AND ASHES,1913
587,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
588,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
589,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
590,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
591,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"O faces that look so coldly at me,"
592,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Colder than dawn through the windows of festival,"
593,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Colder than dawn with her grey nun's face.
594,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"You blame me, you curse me with your eyes,"
595,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"While your lips are filled with flattering syllables,"
596,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"With tinkling bells that harass my calm,"
597,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Disturb my silence and shatter my thoughts.
598,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Your laughter waltzes like musical boxes,"
599,ROCKETS AND ASHES,How can I hear the triumphant symphonies?
600,ROCKETS AND ASHES,The scarlet rhapsodies and beryl-cold sonatas? ...
601,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Ah, strangers, ah, vacant tedious faces,"
602,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Bobbing beneath the feathery hats,"
603,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"You have stolen the wings of birds for your garnishing,"
604,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And the stars and the dim pale petals of the sea
605,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"To make your breasts resplendent, to glitter your dress,--"
606,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"How I might love you and weep for you,"
607,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Crowning your brows with a wreath of songs
608,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"If you could understand my singing,"
609,ROCKETS AND ASHES,If you could understand my love!
610,ROCKETS AND ASHES,But you are waltzing with your marionettes
611,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And marching to the music of the clock--
612,ROCKETS AND ASHES,I cannot bear you to watch me
613,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"With those cold eyes through which I see,"
614,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Emptiness only and dust.

621,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"I see myself in many different dresses,"
622,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"In many moods, and many different places;"
623,ROCKETS AND ASHES,All gold amid the grey where solemn faces
624,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Are silence to my mirth--a flame that blesses
625,ROCKETS AND ASHES,From yellow lamp the darkness which oppresses ...
626,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Or mid the dancers in their trivial laces
627,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Aloof, as in the ring a lion paces,"
628,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Disdainful of their slander or caresses.
629,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"I see myself the child of many races,"
630,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Poisoners, martyrs, harlots and princesses;"
631,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Within my soul a thousand weary traces
632,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Of pain and joy and passionate excesses--
633,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Eternal beauty that our brief love chases
634,ROCKETS AND ASHES,With snatch of desperate hands and dying tresses.

643,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Poems of the red rose and the golden leaf,"
644,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Fantastic faery and gay ballad tune.
645,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
646,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"The long road unto nothing I will sing,"
647,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Sing on one note, monotonous and dry,"
648,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Of sameness, calmness and the years that bring"
649,ROCKETS AND ASHES,No more emotion than the fear to die.
650,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
651,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Grey house, grey house and after that grey house,"
652,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Another house as grey and steep and still:
653,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"An old cat tired of playing with a mouse,"
654,ROCKETS AND ASHES,A sick child tired of chasing down the hill.
655,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
656,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Shuffle and hurry, idle feet, and slow,"
657,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Grim face and merry face, so ugly all!"
658,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Why do you hurry? Where is there to go?
659,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Why are you shouting? Who is there to call?
660,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
661,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Lovers still kissing, feverish to drain"
662,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Stale juices from the shrivelled fruit of lust:
663,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"A black umbrella held up in the rain,"
664,ROCKETS AND ASHES,The raindrops making patterns in the dust.
665,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
666,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"If this distaste I hold for fools is such,"
667,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Shall I not spit upon myself as well?
668,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Do I not eat and drink and smile as much?
669,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Do I not fatten also in this hell?
670,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
671,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Sadness and joy--if they were melted up,"
672,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Things that were great--upon the fires of time
673,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Drop but as soup in the accustomed cup,"
674,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Settle in stagnance, trickle into grime."
675,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
676,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Faith, freedom, art that fire a man or two"
677,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And set him like a pilgrim on his way
678,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"With Beauty's face before him--what of you,"
679,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Priest, Butcher, Scholar, King, upon that day?"
680,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
681,ROCKETS AND ASHES,The dullard-masses that no god can save!
682,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"If I were God, to rise and strike you down"
683,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And break your churches in an angry wave
684,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And make a furious bonfire of your town!
685,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
686,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"God in a coloured globe, alone and still,"
687,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Embroidering wonders with a fearless brain,"
688,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"On loom of spaces measureless, to fill"
689,ROCKETS AND ASHES,The empty air with passion and with pain.
690,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
691,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Emblazon all the heavens with desire
692,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And Wisdom delved for in the depths of time--
693,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Thoughts sculptured mountainous, and fancy's fire"
694,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Caught in the running swiftness of a rhyme.
695,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
696,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Passion high-pedestalled, pangs turned to treasure,"
697,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Perfected and undone and built afresh
698,ROCKETS AND ASHES,With concentrated agony and Pleasure ...
699,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"If I were God, and not a weight of flesh!"

708,ROCKETS AND ASHES,The ghosts of many foods alluring glide
709,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"On golden dishes, wine in purple tide"
710,ROCKETS AND ASHES,To drown our whim. Things danced before the eye
711,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Like tasselled grapes to Tantalus: The sly
712,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Blue of a curling trout, the battened pride"
713,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Of ham in frills, complacent quails that lie"
714,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Resigned to death like heroes--July peas,"
715,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Expectant bottles foaming at the brink--
716,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"White bread, and honey of the golden bees--"
717,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"A peach with velvet coat, some prawns in pink,"
718,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"A slice of beef carved deftly, Stilton cheese,"
719,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And cup where berries float and bubbles wink.

724,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
725,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
726,ROCKETS AND ASHES,It is still something to have cheated God
727,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"And bored the Devil with so easy prey,"
728,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And in the midst of summer woods to raise
729,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"A leafless tree whose stark limbs mock at Heaven,"
730,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Flaunting an iron hatred in the midst of hope--
731,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Yet sometimes in the loneliness of night
732,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"My buried longings blossom on the boughs,"
733,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"My wistful longings come out star by star,"
734,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Till the great sky is light with my desire,"
735,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And on the winds my songs are galloping....
736,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Ah, to what dismal greyness creeps the soul"
737,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Too weak, too tired, to struggle from the slough!"
738,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"My weapons rust, my pen is in the dust,"
739,ROCKETS AND ASHES,The moulting feathers plucked from out my wings
740,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Lie dangling in the hats I stole them for.
741,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"My heart is floating in a claret cup,"
742,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"My brain is toppling drunken at the brim,"
743,ROCKETS AND ASHES,My life is drowned within the lurid dregs.
744,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"I turn and fold my hands in a last appeal,"
745,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"What heaven shall I pray to and for what,"
746,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Now that my songs to penny tunes are set,"
747,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And nothing is to save of me but flesh?

750,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
751,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
752,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
753,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
754,ROCKETS AND ASHES,What words that move on wings in a long drift
755,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Can waft this silence into weary ears,"
756,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And steal into the veins and fingertips
757,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Of restless bodies, like magnificent ships"
758,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Proud from the seas that calmly sail through fears,"
759,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Mean streets, and miseries, with passage swift."
760,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"What words pricked from the stars and shimmering together,"
761,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Or swept like little winds through leaves alert,"
762,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Can filter through the chinks of bolted doors
763,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Deaf to the clamours knocking without pause,"
764,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Steeled with indifference against all hurt,"
765,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Deaf to the cry of man, and rack of weather:"
766,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"To sing the hubbub of this glittering night,"
767,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Where all the lamps each with a separate soul
768,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Throb to the ecstasies of dancing life;
769,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"And Beauty, gleaming high her magic knife"
770,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Cuts free the tethered heart from long control
771,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And flings it like a ball with mad delight
772,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Into the silver lap of the young moon.
773,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"What needles quick, what threads, what fingers fine"
774,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Can broider tapestries as rich as these,"
775,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Stranger than dreams and drifting melodies,"
776,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Transparent as the gods we half divine,"
777,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Frail as the thoughts that dwindle in a swoon
778,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Ghostly before begetting. Tinged with pain
779,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"That glimmers pale on hands we cannot find,"
780,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And visioned faces that our dreams create
781,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Born in the land forbidden us of fate
782,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And longed for all our lives ... What words can bind
783,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Forever Joy, that never comes again!"

789,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
790,ROCKETS AND ASHES,I think myself
791,ROCKETS AND ASHES,The fool of tragedy strutting upon the stage
792,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Where murder creeps and whispers.
793,ROCKETS AND ASHES,The jester clad in piebald tights
794,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Half black, half golden, with no company"
795,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Save bells that jingle,"
796,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"And an effigy,"
797,ROCKETS AND ASHES,The grinning image painted like myself
798,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Upon a stick....
799,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
800,ROCKETS AND ASHES,I think myself
801,ROCKETS AND ASHES,The fool of comedy mournfully straying
802,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Amid the revellers,"
803,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Loving the moon and my own shadow
804,ROCKETS AND ASHES,With its strange solemn gestures--
805,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Loving the painted moon
806,ROCKETS AND ASHES,That lets me play with shadows.
807,ROCKETS AND ASHES,
808,ROCKETS AND ASHES,I am the jester on an empty stage
809,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Playing a pantomime
810,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"To spectres in the stalls,"
811,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Listening at last
812,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"For ghostly mirth and phantom hands applauding,"
813,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And for some king with decadent tired fingers
814,ROCKETS AND ASHES,To fling a white gardenia at my feet.

823,ROCKETS AND ASHES,What is there in your faces
824,ROCKETS AND ASHES,That we should worship with our souls?
825,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Most lovable, perfidious,"
826,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Vague--
827,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Molesting even our visions
828,ROCKETS AND ASHES,With treacherous pathos.
829,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"O vulgarity, mediocrity, stupidity,"
830,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"What is it in you that makes us lavish our love,"
831,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Covering your meagre bodies
832,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"With our passionate mantle, dyed with blood and dreams?"
833,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Life and its grey days, and time"
834,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Are a thin curtain through which you shadow,"
835,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Or a dim glass through which you peer.
836,ROCKETS AND ASHES,You climb in at the windows of our souls
837,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"With ladders and stratagems,"
838,ROCKETS AND ASHES,You mope in corners with reproachful eyes.
839,ROCKETS AND ASHES,But what do you do for us
840,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Lute players, dancers, deceivers,"
841,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Other than lie with red lips
842,ROCKETS AND ASHES,And cajole with tears of beryl?
843,ROCKETS AND ASHES,People--
844,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Men and women with laughable, tragic faces"
845,ROCKETS AND ASHES,"Winking at love,"
846,ROCKETS AND ASHES,Treading our songs and illusions

859,A ROSE,What secretness of love with terrible blushes surging
860,A ROSE,"Unseen, have found in you at last their passionate reflection?"
861,A ROSE,
862,A ROSE,"What dreams that lovers knew, as sleep with subtle magic"
863,A ROSE,"Tore off the rags of life and made her dance with body spangled,"
864,A ROSE,"Drew back the vacant hours, the tedious and the tragic,"
865,A ROSE,And showed the glittering souls from bodies we had mangled;--
866,A ROSE,
867,A ROSE,"What visions made you, emblem of longing and love that has died"
868,A ROSE,"unrequited,"
869,A ROSE,"And all lost joys, and tears, and beauty passionately given,"
870,A ROSE,"Winked at by folly, skewered by the butcher, danced on and"

891,A ROSE,"Peer from the bushes as I wander past,--"

904,A ROSE,Is Grief so proud a king that none shall come
905,A ROSE,"To seek him save the blind, the halt, the lame? ..."
906,A ROSE,"He is a tramp, a beggar, and a clown,"
907,A ROSE,He sits a jester at the feet of kings
908,A ROSE,And scurries with the leaves in Autumn's train.
909,A ROSE,"He rides the wooden horses at a fair,"
910,A ROSE,And dances with the jiggers on the stage.
911,A ROSE,Led by the violins of discontent
912,A ROSE,"That whine their music to my listening soul,"
913,A ROSE,"I dance with him the dance of withered leaves,"
914,A ROSE,We dance together to the tunes of rain

925,A ROSE,"And dawn, that stands ajar to let us in,"
926,A ROSE,"Lies that to which our loves and dreams have gone,"
927,A ROSE,"The paradise of all we might have been,"

939,A ROSE,"As facts that come to pass,"
940,A ROSE,That pass and leave you still
941,A ROSE,"Within your safe small prisons,"
942,A ROSE,"Older, duller,"
943,A ROSE,To walk and talk among the evergreens.
944,A ROSE,You have never known
945,A ROSE,"Delight of dying slowly,"
946,A ROSE,Poisoned with raptures
947,A ROSE,In many hues from the slim-cut decanters of death--
948,A ROSE,The tunes
949,A ROSE,"That dishevel and smooth,"
950,A ROSE,Cajole and melancholize--
951,A ROSE,The dance
952,A ROSE,Which is a whirling of leaves
953,A ROSE,In their last scorn of sorrow
954,A ROSE,Flung upwards by the wind
955,A ROSE,Into the haggard face of winter--
956,A ROSE,Nor felt your souls go blowing like balloons
957,A ROSE,Tossed by impulsive hands;
958,A ROSE,Nor slid as skaters swiftly
959,A ROSE,"Over the crackling crystals of perilous ice,"
960,A ROSE,Buffeted with bouquets and blinded with confetti ...
961,A ROSE,You have not felt the abandon
962,A ROSE,Of light love

975,A ROSE,"For you I sheave the harvest of my hair,"
976,A ROSE,"For you the whiteness of my flesh, my passion's valour,"
977,A ROSE,For you I throw upon the grey screen of the air
978,A ROSE,"My prism-like conceptions, my gigantic colour."
979,A ROSE,
980,A ROSE,For you the delicate hands that fashion to make great
981,A ROSE,"Clay, and white paper, plant a tongue in silence,"

983,A ROSE,"Science for giving wounds, and healing science."

996,A ROSE,A slip of dawn between them is a dangling silver ribbon;
997,A ROSE,And all about the room is quietness--Each patient chair
998,A ROSE,"Erect, alert, in place. A letter on the table and a book"
999,A ROSE,"Lie as you left them, now bereft of purpose--"
1000,A ROSE,"Garish a little in the room's sedateness, you"
1001,A ROSE,Returning dressed so frivolously in all your coloured clothes!
1002,A ROSE,"How grey and sober, full of placid wit"
1003,A ROSE,"The furniture, the pictures on the wall;"
1004,A ROSE,"How steely swift the light, stabbing you to the heart"
1005,A ROSE,"As you stand at the window, bright as rushing blood."
1006,A ROSE,"Garish your hair, your shoes, your startling chalky face"
1007,A ROSE,"And white, white gloves ..."
1008,A ROSE,"What time is it? ... Still ticks the tireless clock,"
1009,A ROSE,With face grimacing ... nearly six it is....
1010,A ROSE,"Yet hurries not nor lingers, like our hearts,"
1011,A ROSE,For in its dial eternity is housed--
1012,A ROSE,A cock should crow ... there are no cocks in town!
1013,A ROSE,But a water cart with surly noise below
1014,A ROSE,Grates unconcerned along the disconsolate street.
1015,A ROSE,"How cold and how familiar all these things,"
1016,A ROSE,To you so lonely in the enormous dawn
1017,A ROSE,Slowly unfastening that vermilion dress ...

1053,NERVES,Strange acrobats to catch them dizzy headed.
1054,NERVES,These tightening strings upon our spirit's fiddles
1055,NERVES,Tuneful or out of tune where music hungers
1056,NERVES,"From writhing bow, these intertwining riddles"
1057,NERVES,Mazes and labyrinths and storms and languors.
1058,NERVES,"These colours twinging on a prism's edges,"
1059,NERVES,These speckled patterns of fanatic madness

1110,NERVES,Spendthrift of passion
1111,NERVES,"In love's bankruptcy,"

1127,NERVES,"For, you are schooled in suffering and schooled"
1128,NERVES,In teaching pain to others--
1129,NERVES,And all that mob of furious accusation
1130,NERVES,"To which you turn the cheek, or curse so well,"

1373,SMOKE,"But out beyond, the armies of the world"
1374,SMOKE,March doomwards to the rhythm of the drum
1375,SMOKE,Under the thirsting sun. Death holds his state:

1377,SMOKE,His skeleton hands are filled with scarlet spoil:
1378,SMOKE,"He stands on flaming ramparts, waving high"
1379,SMOKE,The ensign of decay. All his bones are dressed
1380,SMOKE,With livid roses; all his pillars black
1381,SMOKE,"Are girt in ashen poppies, and on dust"
1382,SMOKE,He raises up his awful golden throne.
1383,SMOKE,
1384,SMOKE,Oh! your fierce shrieks have fainted on deaf ears;
1385,SMOKE,Your tears have flowed on feet of carven stone;
1386,SMOKE,Your blood is spilt for the boiling-pot of God

1401,SMOKE,
1402,SMOKE,I fear a thing more terrible than death:
1403,SMOKE,The glamour of the battle grips us yet--
1404,SMOKE,As crowds before a fire that hold their breath
1405,SMOKE,"Watching the burning houses, and forget"

1417,SMOKE,Hiding the mangled body of the Earth:
1418,SMOKE,"The slow grey aftermath, the limping feet"
1419,SMOKE,"Of days that shall not know the sound of mirth,"
1420,SMOKE,"But pass in dry-eyed patience, with no trust"
1421,SMOKE,Save to end living and be heaped with dust.
1422,SMOKE,
1423,SMOKE,"That stillness that must follow where Death trod,"
1424,SMOKE,"The sullen street, the empty drinking-hall,"
1425,SMOKE,"The tuneless voices cringing praise to God,"
1426,SMOKE,"Deaf gods, that did not heed the anguished call,"
1427,SMOKE,"Now to be soothed with humbleness and praise,"
1428,SMOKE,With fawning kisses for the hand that slays.
1429,SMOKE,
1430,SMOKE,Across the world from out the fevered ground
1431,SMOKE,Decay from every pore exhales its breath;
1432,SMOKE,A cloak of penance winding close around
1433,SMOKE,"The bright desire of spring. And unto Death,"
1434,SMOKE,"As to a conquering king, we yield the keys"
1435,SMOKE,Of Beauty's gates upon our bended knees.
1436,SMOKE,
1437,SMOKE,"The maiden loverless shall go her ways,"
1438,SMOKE,And child unfathered feed on crust and husk;
1439,SMOKE,The sun that was the glory of our days
1440,SMOKE,Shining as tinsel till the moody dusk

1450,SMOKE,And at his coming
1451,SMOKE,The silence fills with tunes and rustling feet
1452,SMOKE,And voices humming.
1453,SMOKE,"He rode a year ago from far away,"
1454,SMOKE,"On charger prancing,"
1455,SMOKE,"With bright new buttons and with ribbons gay,"
1456,SMOKE,And banners dancing.
1457,SMOKE,"Oh, he was fatter than the bursting drum"
1458,SMOKE,"He bore so proudly,"
1459,SMOKE,His roaring music woke the silence dumb
1460,SMOKE,To thunder loudly.
1461,SMOKE,And by his side the old men and the young
1462,SMOKE,Had followed cheering
1463,SMOKE,"Into the sunset smiling as they sung,"
1464,SMOKE,Nor thought of fearing.
1465,SMOKE,"They left their lovers and their mothers' lap,"
1466,SMOKE,"Their homes demolish,"
1467,SMOKE,"""For, look, I have a ribbon for my cap,"
1468,SMOKE,"A sword to polish!"""
1469,SMOKE,"And so the town was silent once again,"
1470,SMOKE,Though tunes of battle
1471,SMOKE,"Beat fearful in the wind, or in the rain"
1472,SMOKE,Ghost drums would rattle.
1473,SMOKE,"But at the chuckling dice or careful loom,"
1474,SMOKE,Or candled churches
1475,SMOKE,A few forgot or prayed or followed doom
1476,SMOKE,With drunken lurches....
1477,SMOKE,"Now loom and bar and church disgorge the throng,"
1478,SMOKE,In huddled masses
1479,SMOKE,They stand aghast to hear the drummer's song
1480,SMOKE,As back he passes--
1481,SMOKE,Palsied and drear and bent he turns alone
1482,SMOKE,"In rags and tatters,"
1483,SMOKE,And on a soundless barrel with a bone
1484,SMOKE,He beats and batters.
1485,SMOKE,"""Where march your feet so gaily, careless crowd,"
1486,SMOKE,That we may kiss them?
1487,SMOKE,Where sound your little songs that rang so loud
1488,SMOKE,"To us that miss them?"""
1489,SMOKE,"There are no songs, no happy marching feet,"
1490,SMOKE,No favours flying:
1491,SMOKE,The drummer passes ... on the quiet street
1492,SMOKE,The sun is dying.
1493,SMOKE,Sun that must bleed to death so red and brave!...

1610,4 A. M.,"The dingy notices once sharp and bright with greed,"

1626,4 A. M.,My frayed gilt fringe of hair and tarnished locks.

2023,FLAME,But as a coward in the general gloom
2024,FLAME,"I mimic fortune with my tunes of ill,"
2025,FLAME,Nor pipe despite her wistful mirth and trill
2026,FLAME,Of love that moves with music into Doom;
2027,FLAME,
2028,FLAME,"Of love that thrills with joy the graveyard cold,"
2029,FLAME,And like a gay canary in a cage
2030,FLAME,"Mocks at his prison, and with flippant rage"
2031,FLAME,Flaunts his bright wing to fill the gloom with gold.

2039,FLAME,"Where all the sleepy afternoon the little tables dream,"
2040,FLAME,"And the cool green bottles ranged, laugh and gleam with golden"
2041,FLAME,"highlights,"
2042,FLAME,"And the waiters wrangle, and the flies, with murmurs merged and mixed."
2043,FLAME,"We will go there, you and I, to wake the nodding contentment,"
2044,FLAME,And toast our fancies reverently with red wine and with white
2045,FLAME,"wine,"
2046,FLAME,"And with eyes mesmerised to the horizon gazing,"
2047,FLAME,Dream our iridescent dreams and sigh our shadowy sighs.

2053,FLAME,
2054,FLAME,Oh canst thou not hear in my heart all its whispering fears
2055,FLAME,Whose wind-like voices
2056,FLAME,Flutter the leaves of my hope and bow them with tears
2057,FLAME,While the body rejoices.
2058,FLAME,"Till all the pomp and beauty of day, the Cardinal Sun"
2059,FLAME,Trailing his scarlet vesture
2060,FLAME,"Leaves after light the pale hills sullen and dun,"
2061,FLAME,Turns with a gesture
2062,FLAME,Colour and glory to smoke that is deathly and grey.
2063,FLAME,I follow the shadows of sorrow
2064,FLAME,That press so close to the dancing heels of the day
2065,FLAME,And darken the morrow.
2066,FLAME,"The world turns pale and cold, for I seem to see"
2067,FLAME,Beyond its golden visor
2068,FLAME,The leering skull that derides at our lives and me
2069,FLAME,Being older than life and wiser....
2070,FLAME,I hear the cry of the world that writhes to the lash of the
2071,FLAME,whip
2072,FLAME,Beyond the sound of the treetops singing
2073,FLAME,"To the wind's persuasive violins and bells of dews that drip,"
2074,FLAME,Or rush of feathers winging....
2075,FLAME,"Dost thou fear death as I? Ah no, but thy lips are against my"
2076,FLAME,cheek
2077,FLAME,Murmuring tenderly
2078,FLAME,The perfumed lies stolen from spring that wistfully through the
2079,FLAME,bleak
2080,FLAME,Windows of frost so slenderly
2081,FLAME,Steals her little ghost's flute. Thou tellest of things that might
2082,FLAME,be
2083,FLAME,"If life were as kind as a lover,"
2084,FLAME,If we were beloved of the world and the world of we.
2085,FLAME,Thy white words hover
2086,FLAME,Dove-like in rose leaf evenings over the nest
2087,FLAME,Silvering heaven
2088,FLAME,With rustle of lovers that nestle together for rest.
2089,FLAME,If I could have given
2090,FLAME,"My tired lips to kisses and my body to sleep and to thee,"
2091,FLAME,Ah then and then only
2092,FLAME,The dust were as gentleness mingling thy beauty with me
2093,FLAME,And death were not lonely.

2096,FLAME,
2097,FLAME,
2098,FLAME,
2099,FLAME,
2100,FLAME,As in the silence the clear moonlight drips
2101,FLAME,"Among the fields that love her drowsily,"
2102,FLAME,"These passionate moments trickle on through time,"
2103,FLAME,From soul to languorous soul.
2104,FLAME,"Like mad musicians upon fretted harps,"
2105,FLAME,"The senses play upon the poignant nerves,--"
2106,FLAME,And colours clothe our mood
2107,FLAME,"As smoke against the light, as shimmering prisms"
2108,FLAME,Irised with pallors of an opal's heart
2109,FLAME,In which the glittered pattern of desire
2110,FLAME,Smoulders and changes....
2111,FLAME,"O love, thou nightingale-throated singer,"
2112,FLAME,Thread on thy jewelled chords from start to star
2113,FLAME,And keep thy silver delicate delight
2114,FLAME,Out of the flush and lustre that makes mad.
2115,FLAME,Let thy fairy feet
2116,FLAME,"Go tripping down a scarcely scented path,"
2117,FLAME,Between an avenue of breathless flowers.
2118,FLAME,"The hours glide by as swans across a lake,"
2119,FLAME,"Across the luminous waters of desire,"
2120,FLAME,"And beat as wings the rustle of soft words,"
2121,FLAME,"As love bends down,"
2122,FLAME,Breathing his adoration on a fainting mouth.
2123,FLAME,
2124,FLAME,1917
2125,FLAME,
2126,FLAME,
2127,FLAME,
2128,FLAME,
2129,FLAME,I can but give thee unsubstantial things
2130,FLAME,"Wrapt as in rose-leaves between thought and thought,"
2131,FLAME,No gems or garments marvellously wrought
2132,FLAME,On ivory spools with rare embroiderings.
2133,FLAME,"Nor for thy fingers precious, fabled rings"
2134,FLAME,"That cardinals have worn, and queens have bought"
2135,FLAME,With blood and beauty. I have only sought
2136,FLAME,A song that hovers on illusive wings.
2137,FLAME,
2138,FLAME,"Accept from me a dream that hath no art,"
2139,FLAME,"I give my empty hands for thee to hold,"
2140,FLAME,"Take thou the gift of silence for my part,"
2141,FLAME,With all the deeper things I have not told.
2142,FLAME,"Yet if thou canst, decipher in my heart"
2143,FLAME,Its passions writ in hieroglyphs of gold.

2150,I,I
2151,I,
2152,I,"I have no other friend but thee,"
2153,I,But while I tell thee all my thought
2154,I,"Thine ears are buzzing with gossip of dreams,"
2155,I,"Soothsayings and sighs, and little things--"
2156,I,How canst thou listen to me?
2157,I,
2158,I,
2159,II,II
2160,II,
2161,II,"Perchance I roamed under the old moon too long,"
2162,II,And when my cheek grew pale
2163,II,I laid it against thine to feel the blood beat back
2164,II,Responsive in the double rose of joy--
2165,II,But I feel thee shifting away into loneliness
2166,II,Where the ghost moon glides between us....
2167,II,
2168,II,
2169,III,III
2170,III,
2171,III,When at a masquerade
2172,III,"I meet thee in the shrill indifferent throng,"
2173,III,Our faces painted each in some disguise
2174,III,Of varnished revelry;
2175,III,I whisper in thine ear
2176,III,"Fables, and flatteries, and inconsequent tales,"
2177,III,"Trivial as the dust that whirls about our feet,"
2178,III,And shower the multicoloured streamers high
2179,III,Where Folly is king of midnight--
2180,III,"Suddenly dost thou snatch thy mask aside,"
2181,III,"And thy still face looks out,"
2182,III,Weary and overwise
2183,III,Where the mad pretence avails not.
2184,III,
2185,III,
2186,IV,IV
2187,IV,
2188,IV,Long ago we walked together in a garden;
2189,IV,It was evening and the leaves fell down;
2190,IV,"Silently we passed over the dead, the fallen,"
2191,IV,Over flowers and branches that were withered there--
2192,IV,"And the air was weary with the scent of other days,"
2193,IV,A fragrance faint and pensive.
2194,IV,The sighing of the leaves beneath our feet
2195,IV,"Were as old dreams retold,"
2196,IV,"Stirred from the golden quilt of memory,"
2197,IV,"And farewells rang their whispering bells,"
2198,IV,Tolling the days away.
2199,IV,But peace lay folded between our hands
2200,IV,As we thought of the vanishing years
2201,IV,And of love dying in the arms of love.
2202,IV,
2203,IV,
2204,V,V
2205,V,
2206,V,Sometimes I look into the glass
2207,V,And see my face without the conquering light
2208,V,That gave me glamour when I gave thee love.
2209,V,"Fain would I bathe in the fountains of beauty,"
2210,V,"To glitter with the crystals of her sparkling desire,"
2211,V,"And touch with my feet the floors of a bright paven Hell,"
2212,V,And rear my head among the lilies of Heaven.
2213,V,I would be for thee
2214,V,"As a ring of white flowers on the sward,"
2215,V,"As a red fire playing to thy breath,"
2216,V,As a flock of kingfishers
2217,V,Surprised from the dark fringe of rushes!
2218,V,"Remember only this,"
2219,V,"My will toward all loveliness, and look"
2220,V,Deep in thyself for my reflected soul.
2221,V,
2222,V,
2223,VI,VI
2224,VI,
2225,VI,Be perfect--for I love thee more in thought
2226,VI,Than thou canst reach in every trivial day.
2227,VI,Since days are as the flowers on a wreath
2228,VI,That wither while we bind them each to each.
2229,VI,"Only the soul is timeless, and no round of days"
2230,VI,Can wall it in a little space of ground.
2231,VI,Sometimes our minds are cheated by the clock
2232,VI,"And crave love, wisdom, joy within an hour,"
2233,VI,But the patient spirit stands
2234,VI,Waiting the last fulfilment.
2235,VI,Around thy soul my thoughts are as garlands
2236,VI,Or as an endless rosary.
2237,VI,Be perfect! lest my psalm should falter
2238,VI,And my hands part from the unriveted faith
2239,VI,With Amen scarcely sighed.
2240,VI,
2241,VI,1917

2243,VI,

2246,VI,"Bodies heaving like waves,"
2247,VI,"Sighing through the dishevelled tresses of foam,"
2248,VI,"The massive whiteness of limbs flung out of shadow,"
2249,VI,"Splashed with ecstasial moonlight,"
2250,VI,Sculptured voluptuously in ephemeral marbles.
2251,VI,"Lingering touch of fingers,"
2252,VI,Cooler than the curving ringlets of spray
2253,VI,"Fluting the new-blown petals of a shell,"
2254,VI,And kisses murmuring as the lips of darkness
2255,VI,Against the ivory forehead of the moon.

2257,VI,1919
2258,VI,
2259,VI,
2260,VI,
2261,VI,
2262,VI,Your face to me is like a beautiful city
2263,VI,"Dreaming forever by the rough wild sea,"
2264,VI,And I the ship upon a wilderness of waves
2265,VI,Heavily laden with memories....
2266,VI,I roam over all the earth
2267,VI,"Making rhymes of you, and singing songs,"
2268,VI,"Because your face will never let me rest,"
2269,VI,Because I can not frame it in a star
2270,VI,"Surrounded with my cloudy reveries,"
2271,VI,Because I may not pluck it like a flower
2272,VI,To breathe the incense of its perfumed soul--
2273,VI,Your face is like the carved hilt of a sword
2274,VI,Whose sheath is in my breast!
2275,VI,
2276,VI,1918
2277,VI,
2278,VI,
2279,VI,
2280,VI,
2281,VI,Oh! why will you not let me love you
2282,VI,Well enough?
2283,VI,"You have plucked my blossoms,"
2284,VI,Gathered the leaves
2285,VI,And revived them with water;
2286,VI,But all the tortuous roots
2287,VI,Delving for your spirit
2288,VI,In subterranean passions
2289,VI,"With a blind unresting desire,"
2290,VI,"Have you felt them, have you known?"
2291,VI,In the blackest night of sleep
2292,VI,Though I be sunk a thousand fathoms
2293,VI,"In the cerulean depths of slow oblivion,"
2294,VI,My soul still swims toward you
2295,VI,Against the envious pressure of the tide....
2296,VI,"You who are so tired, so filled with sleep"
2297,VI,That you would brush a rose-leaf from your cheek
2298,VI,"Lest its heaviness should stir your rest,"
2299,VI,How can you shoulder the weight of my great burden
2300,VI,That is too vast for me to bear alone?
2301,VI,I tell you
2302,VI,"Love is no little thing,"
2303,VI,"No moth-winged Cupid painted on the air,"
2304,VI,No thin flute music petaling the silence
2305,VI,As leaves that flutter from a cherry tree.
2306,VI,"It is the thought that broods upon its death,"
2307,VI,The dread of mountains looking to the storm
2308,VI,Ere shrieks of lightning cleave their breasts in twain.
2309,VI,It is the fire that pillars up the stars
2310,VI,To mix its flame with their eternal gold.
2311,VI,"Oh, listen to me!"
2312,VI,You shall hear my message sung from sphere to sphere
2313,VI,As star-dust pouring a path through Heaven.
2314,VI,You shall know me
2315,VI,"In the pensive shadows of trees,"
2316,VI,In the luminary phantoms
2317,VI,Reflected in the stillness of a lake;
2318,VI,In the arrows of sunlight shot through meshing leaves
2319,VI,And quivering in the moss;
2320,VI,In the abandoned play of breakers
2321,VI,Showering their crystals to the moon;
2322,VI,In the folly of rainbow dolphins.
2323,VI,I only ask of you
2324,VI,"To be the diver in my deepest pool,"
2325,VI,To bring from out its blue obscurity
2326,VI,"The things my life has moulded unaware,"
2327,VI,Treasures my passion and my hunger fashioned
2328,VI,"In loneliness of prayer unlit by life,"
2329,VI,Created out of nothing save myself
2330,VI,Within the blind fast silence of the soul.

2338,VI,Holding a candle to illumine your face.
2339,VI,My loneliness is your shadow
2340,VI,Along the solitary roads.
2341,VI,My passion is a book between your hands
2342,VI,"Whose leaves are as the leaves of violets,"
2343,VI,A volume of pressed flowers
2344,VI,Scenting your fingers though you read it not.
2345,VI,And my white faith
2346,VI,Is a silken surplice clothing you in peace.

2452,LONDON,Thou that begot me: From whose streets triumphant
2453,LONDON,"I, coloured fiercely with thy passion, wakened!"
2454,LONDON,"I sucked red wine, not milk, from thy gaunt bosom,"
2455,LONDON,"My senses in thy fearfulness found beauty,"
2456,LONDON,And honey in thine oaths and lamentations.
2457,LONDON,I played about thy feet that know not resting

2501,LONDON,Moves opulent among the groves of summer;
2502,LONDON,"The larks delight, the laughter of the thrushes,"
2503,LONDON,"The kindly peasants in their ruddy orchard,"

2642,LONDON,Come back to dream there where they once had dreamed.
2643,LONDON,

2654,LONDON,So much he loved their frail inconsequence.

2866,STREETS,For some sweet promise to unfold itself
2867,STREETS,"From the shut scrolls of sleep,"

2876,STREETS,No scarves of sleep and silence can be bound

2956,SUNDAY,Of time moves onward; as in coloured boats
2957,SUNDAY,"A thousand souls go sailing,"
2958,SUNDAY,And stilly down the tide my spirit floats
2959,SUNDAY,Singing or wailing
2960,SUNDAY,To the tune the waters make. Here we forget a space
2961,SUNDAY,"The crawling sins of man that sting and gloat,"
2962,SUNDAY,"The pain and fear that haggers every face,"
2963,SUNDAY,But vaguely and remote
2964,SUNDAY,The strident trumpet and the clamorous voices sound--
2965,SUNDAY,"Grief doth forget to curse her Gods or pray,"
2966,SUNDAY,While pagan follies squander all around
2967,SUNDAY,Their brief gay hours in holiday;
2968,SUNDAY,For all prayers die when laughter is on the lips.--
2969,SUNDAY,"How frail the moods of joy, how sweet to see them pass"

2982,SUNDAY,Rustling and whispering forever.
2983,SUNDAY,"The sad music of Life is in my ears,"
2984,SUNDAY,"Never ceasing, never asleep,"

3023,SUNDAY,Fluttering from bloom to bloom.
3024,SUNDAY,Sprays of lilac flowers
3025,SUNDAY,"Frothing at the green verge of midnight waves,"

3045,SUNDAY,"What crime was yours, old woman,"
3046,SUNDAY,What sin against the Earth
3047,SUNDAY,That she should give you now
3048,SUNDAY,"A cap of dust and furrows on your cheeks,"
3049,SUNDAY,And at the end
3050,SUNDAY,A hole dug in the mould?
3051,SUNDAY,"Is death the promise of Fate's last rebound,"
3052,SUNDAY,Revenge of Time that waits within the clock
3053,SUNDAY,"And laughs awry at life,"
3054,SUNDAY,"For a kiss, for a dream, for a child that you bore,"
3055,SUNDAY,For a fresh rose pinned to your bosom?
3056,SUNDAY,"The owl is in your spirit,"
3057,SUNDAY,Blinking through the oldest tree of wisdom--
3058,SUNDAY,And now your fingers are weaving
3059,SUNDAY,The cold pale invisible blossoms of death
3060,SUNDAY,"Into a waxen wreath,"

3074,SUNDAY,My spirit speaks
3075,SUNDAY,In the scented quietness of a divine melancholy
3076,SUNDAY,Murmuring the tunes
3077,SUNDAY,For which my dreams are the delicate instruments.
3078,SUNDAY,The shadowy silences
3079,SUNDAY,"Have made me beautiful and dressed me in velvet dignities,"
3080,SUNDAY,And that is why
3081,SUNDAY,"The noise of tambourines has maddened my soul into dancing,"
3082,SUNDAY,And I am clad
3083,SUNDAY,In the lust-lipped whispering of furtive caresses.
3084,SUNDAY,"Holiness I love,"

3086,SUNDAY,The crucified feet
3087,SUNDAY,Nestled among lilies and hallowing candles.
3088,SUNDAY,Holiness I love
3089,SUNDAY,And the melodious absolution falling on my sins.

3120,SUNDAY,"I saw in his eyes the vision of highborn ghosts,"

3134,SUNDAY,"Toasting some wild, irreverent dream,"

3148,SUNDAY,"Nor her pale son that sat so hunched and still,"

3161,SUNDAY,Not here should I discover the answer to bring light into my
3162,SUNDAY,"darkness,"
3163,SUNDAY,Into the dim psychic crystals of my soul opalled with the changing
3164,SUNDAY,colours of unrest--
3165,SUNDAY,"So I went away into the loneliness, asking the forests and the"
3166,SUNDAY,mountains and the sea
3167,SUNDAY,The knowledge of life's baffling mysteries.
3168,SUNDAY,"But they were roaring in a wind of memories,"

3379,VAHDAH,Because our childish fingers curiously
3380,VAHDAH,Crave the pale secrets of the moon
3381,VAHDAH,And grope for dangerous toys.
3382,VAHDAH,Happiness comes in giving back to Earth
3383,VAHDAH,"The things we took from her with violent hands,"

3407,VAHDAH,Lies casketed in amber; where the stress
3408,VAHDAH,"Of peril, hunger, Death can never cry"
3409,VAHDAH,"To wake me from my sanguine weariness,"
3410,VAHDAH,Or cloud the lucid stillness with a sigh.
3411,VAHDAH,
3412,VAHDAH,1918
3413,VAHDAH,
3414,VAHDAH,
3415,VAHDAH,
3416,VAHDAH,
3417,VAHDAH,I laid my heart on a stone
3418,VAHDAH,And stood in the wood to watch.
3419,VAHDAH,Presently a priest came by;
3420,VAHDAH,He hid it in his cowl
3421,VAHDAH,And buried it in the graveyard.
3422,VAHDAH,"Now is it grown into a cyclamen tree,"
3423,VAHDAH,"Clustering over the wall,"
3424,VAHDAH,Beckoning far along the twilight road;
3425,VAHDAH,"Nodding and singing where the cypress moans,"
3426,VAHDAH,Ringing its little bells while the great bell tolls.
3427,VAHDAH,"Whiter than ghosts are its flowers,"
3428,VAHDAH,And its scent is sweeter than ghostly music--
3429,VAHDAH,All the men and priests that pass
3430,VAHDAH,"In the night when the stars lean down,"
3431,VAHDAH,Smell the heavy fragrance there
3432,VAHDAH,And feel the gentle touch of dripping dew.
3433,VAHDAH,Then they cross themselves and go
3434,VAHDAH,"Hurriedly, warily,"
3435,VAHDAH,"Dreaming of pale women,"
3436,VAHDAH,Under the pale stars.
3437,VAHDAH,
3438,VAHDAH,1918
3439,VAHDAH,
3440,VAHDAH,
3441,VAHDAH,
3442,VAHDAH,
3443,VAHDAH,The cold light steals into my soul
3444,VAHDAH,"Revealing its emptiness,"
3445,VAHDAH,The cold winds batter at my heart
3446,VAHDAH,And make its lonely tenant shake with fear--
3447,VAHDAH,The raindrops slide across the window-glass
3448,VAHDAH,Like sighs that fall from patient weariness;
3449,VAHDAH,And coldly smiling time
3450,VAHDAH,"Peers with his clock-face, ticking in my brain"
3451,VAHDAH,The pulse of a monotonous remorse.
3452,VAHDAH,
3453,VAHDAH,1918
3454,VAHDAH,
3455,VAHDAH,
3456,VAHDAH,
3457,VAHDAH,
3458,VAHDAH,"The caravans of spring are in the town,"
3459,VAHDAH,"Lighting their brilliant torches in the park,"
3460,VAHDAH,"Dangling their bells, engirdling each stark"
3461,VAHDAH,Black tree with coloured rings. The houses frown
3462,VAHDAH,"Against the beryl sky, yet wear a crown"
3463,VAHDAH,"Of hazy dream, or flash a golden spark"
3464,VAHDAH,Of sun-fire in their windows glum and dark;
3465,VAHDAH,The people blow like petals up and down.
3466,VAHDAH,
3467,VAHDAH,"But London tires at evening, each grey street"
3468,VAHDAH,"Mourns as the slow procession passes by,"
3469,VAHDAH,"Traffic and crowd, and Time on loitering feet."
3470,VAHDAH,"Spring droops his lute, the slender echoes sigh,"
3471,VAHDAH,"And wistfully the jaded revellers meet,"
3472,VAHDAH,Their pomp in tatters and their wreaths awry.
3473,VAHDAH,
3474,VAHDAH,1918
3475,VAHDAH,
3476,VAHDAH,
3477,VAHDAH,
3478,VAHDAH,
3479,VAHDAH,I dread the beauty of approaching spring
3480,VAHDAH,Now the old month is dead and the young moon
3481,VAHDAH,Has pierced my heart with her sharp silver horns.
3482,VAHDAH,My tired soul is startled out of sleep
3483,VAHDAH,"By all the urging joy of bud and leaf,"
3484,VAHDAH,And in the barren yard where I have paced
3485,VAHDAH,"Content with prison and despair's monotony,"
3486,VAHDAH,"The trees break into music wild and shrill,"
3487,VAHDAH,"And flowers come out like stars amid the dust,"
3488,VAHDAH,Bewildering my loneliness with beauty....
3489,VAHDAH,For winter with her melancholy face
3490,VAHDAH,"Shone back my miseries as in a glass,"
3491,VAHDAH,And wept and whined in harmony with me;
3492,VAHDAH,And I could listen by the withering ashes
3493,VAHDAH,"To the ill-omened drum of dropping rain,"
3494,VAHDAH,"And sighing harken sighs and mute feel silence,"
3495,VAHDAH,"And cold stretch forth my hand into the snows,"
3496,VAHDAH,"And hating, hear the laughter of the wind"
3497,VAHDAH,Whose mad hands tear the sky.
3498,VAHDAH,But now again the promise of the spring
3499,VAHDAH,"Shall lift my martyred spirit from the dust,"
3500,VAHDAH,"To where the lilied altar shines with peace,"
3501,VAHDAH,And the white priestess comes
3502,VAHDAH,Crowning each candle with a gold desire
3503,VAHDAH,Engirdling with pallors
3504,VAHDAH,The forehead of a divine ghost.
3505,VAHDAH,"Ah, but they die, these gods, the candles dwindle"
3506,VAHDAH,And spring is but a radiant beckoning
3507,VAHDAH,"To death that follows slowly, silently...."
3508,VAHDAH,
3509,VAHDAH,"O flitting swallows, fleeting laugh of wind,"
3510,VAHDAH,O flash of silver in the wings of dawn
3511,VAHDAH,That are spread out and closed. O hush of night
3512,VAHDAH,"Breathless with love, oh swish of whispering tide"
3513,VAHDAH,That swells and shrinks upon the dreaming shore.
3514,VAHDAH,O gentle eyes of children wonder-wide
3515,VAHDAH,That grow too soon to weariness and close;
3516,VAHDAH,"O scuttling run of rabbit on the hills,"
3517,VAHDAH,And flight of lazy rooks above the elm;
3518,VAHDAH,"O birds' eggs frail, tinged faintly, nestled close,"
3519,VAHDAH,And mystery of flower in the bud.
3520,VAHDAH,"O burning galaxy of buttercups,"
3521,VAHDAH,"And drone of bees above the pouting rose,--"
3522,VAHDAH,O twilit lovers stilled with reverie
3523,VAHDAH,And footprints of them swerving on the sand
3524,VAHDAH,And darkness of them clasped against the sky!
3525,VAHDAH,I see beyond the glory of your days
3526,VAHDAH,The grey days marching one behind the other
3527,VAHDAH,To the bleak tunes of silence.
3528,VAHDAH,When mists shall smear the radiance of the moon
3529,VAHDAH,"And the lean thief shall pass,"
3530,VAHDAH,"Snatching the glittering toys away from love,"
3531,VAHDAH,Plucking the feathers from the wings of peace.
3532,VAHDAH,"And Life herself, grown old and crooked now,"
3533,VAHDAH,"Shall go the way that her long shadow points,"
3534,VAHDAH,Her long black shadow down the roads of sleep.

3543,TO MY FATHER,
3544,TO MY FATHER,"I cannot think that you have gone away,"
3545,TO MY FATHER,"You loved the earth--and life lit up your eyes,"
3546,TO MY FATHER,And flickered in your smile that would surmise
3547,TO MY FATHER,"Death as a song, a poem, or a play."
3548,TO MY FATHER,"You were reborn afresh with every day,"
3549,TO MY FATHER,And baffled fortune in some new disguise.
3550,TO MY FATHER,"Ah! can it perish when the body dies,"
3551,TO MY FATHER,"Such youth, such love, such passion to be gay?"
3552,TO MY FATHER,
3553,TO MY FATHER,We shall not see you come to us and leave
3554,TO MY FATHER,A conqueror--nor catch on fairy wing
3555,TO MY FATHER,Some slender fancy--nor new wonders weave
3556,TO MY FATHER,Upon the loom of your imagining.
3557,TO MY FATHER,"The world is wearier, grown dark to grieve"
3558,TO MY FATHER,Her child that was a pilgrim and a king.

3569,TO MY MOTHER,"Before the lamps are lit within my room,"
3570,TO MY MOTHER,"My memories hang bright upon the gloom,"
3571,TO MY MOTHER,Like ancient frescoes painted on the wall.
3572,TO MY MOTHER,
3573,TO MY MOTHER,And I can hear the call of birds and bells
3574,TO MY MOTHER,"And shadowy sound of waves, and wind through leaves"
3575,TO MY MOTHER,"And wind that rustles through the burnished sheaves,"
3576,TO MY MOTHER,And far off voices whispering farewells.
3577,TO MY MOTHER,
3578,TO MY MOTHER,I dream again the joy I used to know
3579,TO MY MOTHER,While straying by the sea that hardly sighed
3580,TO MY MOTHER,"A sorrow in my singing, as the tide"
3581,TO MY MOTHER,"Crept up to clasp me, smiled, and let me go."
3582,TO MY MOTHER,
3583,TO MY MOTHER,"And I remember all the glad lost hours,"
3584,TO MY MOTHER,"The racing of brown rabbits on the hill,"
3585,TO MY MOTHER,"The winds that prowled around the lonely mill,"
3586,TO MY MOTHER,"Laburnum laughter, music of the flowers."
3587,TO MY MOTHER,
3588,TO MY MOTHER,"The berries plucked with loitering delight,"
3589,TO MY MOTHER,"Staining the dusk with purple, till the thought"
3590,TO MY MOTHER,Of starry little ghosts behind us caught
3591,TO MY MOTHER,Our hearts and made us fearful of the night.
3592,TO MY MOTHER,
3593,TO MY MOTHER,The London evenings huddled in the rain
3594,TO MY MOTHER,"Whose misty prisms shone with lamplight pale,"
3595,TO MY MOTHER,"Making our hearts seem sinister and frail,"
3596,TO MY MOTHER,Fainting our thoughts with mystery and pain.
3597,TO MY MOTHER,
3598,TO MY MOTHER,"I have a world of memories to dream,"
3599,TO MY MOTHER,To touch with loving fingers as a sigh
3600,TO MY MOTHER,Revives a little flame and lets it die.
3601,TO MY MOTHER,"Ah, were the days as lovely as they seem"
3602,TO MY MOTHER,
3603,TO MY MOTHER,Now that they look so peaceful lying dead?
3604,TO MY MOTHER,"And is it all the hope of Joy we have,"
3605,TO MY MOTHER,The broken trophies of the things she gave
3606,TO MY MOTHER,And took away to give us dreams instead?
3607,TO MY MOTHER,
3608,TO MY MOTHER,The things we love and lose before we find
3609,TO MY MOTHER,"The way to love them well enough and keep,"
3610,TO MY MOTHER,That now are woven on the looms of sleep
3611,TO MY MOTHER,That now are only music of the wind.

3616,TO MY MOTHER,
3617,TO MY MOTHER,
3618,TO MY MOTHER,"London grows sad at evening,"
3619,TO MY MOTHER,And we at the windows sit
3620,TO MY MOTHER,"To watch her moods,"
3621,TO MY MOTHER,Wearying with her.
3622,TO MY MOTHER,Even a noise of laughter from the street
3623,TO MY MOTHER,Sounds in our ears
3624,TO MY MOTHER,Like something dropped and shattered on the stone.
3625,TO MY MOTHER,"Then her musician comes,"
3626,TO MY MOTHER,"A wandering, malicious spirit;"
3627,TO MY MOTHER,"The organ grinder, playing those old tunes"
3628,TO MY MOTHER,"We know too well,"
3629,TO MY MOTHER,That hurt us with fatigue.
3630,TO MY MOTHER,"Till Hope like a harlequin,"
3631,TO MY MOTHER,"His glitter hidden in a ragged coat,"
3632,TO MY MOTHER,"The lamplighter, goes by,"
3633,TO MY MOTHER,Planting his pale flames in the dusk.

3640,TO MY MOTHER,"Ah! the spring,"
3641,TO MY MOTHER,"Sudden, surprising,"
3642,TO MY MOTHER,Melting the iron scales around the heart
3643,TO MY MOTHER,As the earliest sun
3644,TO MY MOTHER,Melts the cold case of dew on leaves--
3645,TO MY MOTHER,Ah! the streets like odorous rivers
3646,TO MY MOTHER,Chanting the echoes of seas--
3647,TO MY MOTHER,Ah! the flowers in shop-windows
3648,TO MY MOTHER,"Beseeching, persuasive,"
3649,TO MY MOTHER,Reluctant to let their beauty flow away
3650,TO MY MOTHER,From thoughts that mirror them in passing--
3651,TO MY MOTHER,Beautiful exiles
3652,TO MY MOTHER,"Fluttering in their chains,"
3653,TO MY MOTHER,"Thrilled with the noise of bees,"
3654,TO MY MOTHER,The music of meadows
3655,TO MY MOTHER,Still hovering around them--
3656,TO MY MOTHER,"Flower fingers, flower-touches,"
3657,TO MY MOTHER,"Passional, reminiscent,"
3658,TO MY MOTHER,Rippling the soul's still waters--
3659,TO MY MOTHER,"Flower galaxies,"
3660,TO MY MOTHER,"Enamelled bridges arching from dream to dream,"
3661,TO MY MOTHER,"Garlands splashing over the eyes of satyrs,"
3662,TO MY MOTHER,"The furtive woodland eyes,"
3663,TO MY MOTHER,The pointed inquisitive ears--
3664,TO MY MOTHER,"Pallid flowers foaming on hill-crests,"
3665,TO MY MOTHER,Gushing heavenwards
3666,TO MY MOTHER,From a sea of stormy mountains--
3667,TO MY MOTHER,"Opening and shutting exquisite doors,"
3668,TO MY MOTHER,"As the senses open to music,"
3669,TO MY MOTHER,"Shut upon silence,"
3670,TO MY MOTHER,"Open to beauty,"
3671,TO MY MOTHER,Close their caskets upon love--
3672,TO MY MOTHER,"Ah! the flowers in the windows,"
3673,TO MY MOTHER,Amorous of poets
3674,TO MY MOTHER,Making a chaplet of song!
