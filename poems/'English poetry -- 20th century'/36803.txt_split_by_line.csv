58,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,FROM _The New Witness_
59,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,
60,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,MR. BERNARD GILBERT is one of the discoveries of the War. For
61,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,"years, it seems, he has been writing poetry, but it is only"
62,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,recently that an inapprehensive country has awakened to the
63,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,fact. Now he is taking his rightful place among our foremost
64,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,"singers. What William Barnes was to Dorset, what T. E. Brown was"
65,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,to the Manx people--this is Mr. Gilbert to the folk of his
66,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,"native county of Lincoln. He has interpreted their lives, their"
67,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,"sorrows, their aspirations, with a surprising fidelity. Mr."
68,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,Gilbert never loses his grip upon realities. One feels that he
69,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,knows the men of whom he writes in their most intimate moods;
70,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,"knows, too, their defects, which he does not shrink from"
71,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,recording. There is little of the dreamy idealism of the South
72,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,in the peasant people of Lincolnshire. The outwardly respectable
73,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,"chapel-goer who asks himself, in a moment of introspection"
74,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,
75,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,But why not have a good time here?
76,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,Why should the Devil have all the beer?
77,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,
78,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,"is true to type. But he has, too, his softer moods. Fidelity in"
79,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,"friendship, courage, resource and perseverance--these are"
80,MISCELLANEOUS: LIVING LINCOLN; FORTUNES FOR FARMERS.,typical of the men of the Fens.

153,THE FOOL,"I am with poor against rich, labour against employer, women against"

155,THE FOOL,I welcome foes; I desire criticism.
156,THE FOOL,"I loathe prejudice, either social or national; I repudiate all"

158,THE FOOL,I demand freedom of action and leisure for reflection.

171,THE FOOL,"Before the blast of Freedom, thrones are hurled:"
172,THE FOOL,The People are awake!
173,THE FOOL,
174,THE FOOL,Over the Ark of Tyranny
175,THE FOOL,The red flag flaunts abroad for all to see!
176,THE FOOL,Whilst to the roll of drums
177,THE FOOL,"Swelling triumphantly, the glad cry comes:"
178,THE FOOL,The People shall be free!
179,THE FOOL,
180,THE FOOL,"In dungeons, men, long-bound for freedom's sake,"
181,THE FOOL,"Forgotten of God, deep-frozen by despair,"
182,THE FOOL,Hear with surprise that clangorous fanfare:
183,THE FOOL,The People are awake!
184,THE FOOL,
185,THE FOOL,"Our fathers heard the call,"
186,THE FOOL,"When Liberty from her bonds like the angry sea,"
187,THE FOOL,"Pouring mightily forth, slew tyranny,"
188,THE FOOL,"And singing the Marseillaise, bade crowns to fall,"
189,THE FOOL,That all men should be free!
190,THE FOOL,
191,THE FOOL,Men shall be slaves no more!
192,THE FOOL,From sea to sea
193,THE FOOL,That Word of hope unspeakable succour brings;

204,THE FOOL,Coz if there were--
205,THE FOOL,My boy what's under foreign sod
206,THE FOOL,"Would be alive, and here:"
207,THE FOOL,Instead of which young William Porter
208,THE FOOL,What never listed when he orter--
209,THE FOOL,Has his farm;
210,THE FOOL,And braunges yonder safe away from harm.
211,THE FOOL,
212,THE FOOL,Poor lad!--he went--
213,THE FOOL,I can't forgit that night--
214,THE FOOL,While Porter laughed him outer sight;
215,THE FOOL,Now--he is spent:
216,THE FOOL,Porter's all right.
217,THE FOOL,
218,THE FOOL,What does he care?
219,THE FOOL,"He's thinking of another farm,"
220,THE FOOL,Instead of laying in some ditch
221,THE FOOL,He's rich!
222,THE FOOL,And folk'll gallop at his nod.
223,THE FOOL,

231,THE FOOL,'The Night is Dark'
232,THE FOOL,
233,THE FOOL,
234,THE FOOL,Safe-guarded dwellers in your sea-girt eyrie
235,THE FOOL,How fares the fight?
236,THE FOOL,"Terror has crept beneath your ocean wall,"
237,THE FOOL,"Horror is over-reaching, to appal;"
238,THE FOOL,Your sons are menaced by a furnace fiery:
239,THE FOOL,What of the night?
240,THE FOOL,
241,THE FOOL,A hundred years have passed at ease
242,THE FOOL,Since last you fought on bended knees;
243,THE FOOL,"And joints, unused, grow stiff and old,"
244,THE FOOL,And hearts unroused are faint and cold;
245,THE FOOL,"Whilst they who own but wealth, their creed,"
246,THE FOOL,Stand helpless in the hour of need.
247,THE FOOL,
248,THE FOOL,Oh peace-bound nation!
249,THE FOOL,Lapped in rich sloth; untroubled generation!
250,THE FOOL,Know you that races change?
251,THE FOOL,"Some dwindle slowly downward in decay,"
252,THE FOOL,"Unconscious, till the dawning of the day:"
253,THE FOOL,At touch of fire we learn how they are faring;
254,THE FOOL,Thrice welcome is the test to nations daring;
255,THE FOOL,To some--how strange!
256,THE FOOL,
257,THE FOOL,Our ancient enemy--now brother--
258,THE FOOL,From one Napoleon to another
259,THE FOOL,Has seen his country ebb and flow
260,THE FOOL,"And now he holds the sternest foe,"
261,THE FOOL,Learning the lesson of strenuous fight
262,THE FOOL,To brace defensive armour tight:
263,THE FOOL,But what of you--old Islanders
264,THE FOOL,So roughly woke?
265,THE FOOL,Has gilded sloth 'mid dreamless calm
266,THE FOOL,"Stifled your soul, close wrapped from harm,"
267,THE FOOL,In Neptune's cloak?
268,THE FOOL,"Or is it but an idle dress,"
269,THE FOOL,Thrown off at breath of fearful stress?
270,THE FOOL,Or has it slowly strangled that old oak?
271,THE FOOL,
272,THE FOOL,None may foretell;
273,THE FOOL,But this we know:
274,THE FOOL,"As fire testeth iron through and through,"
275,THE FOOL,So shall it be with you!
276,THE FOOL,"Not yet have you passed furnace-wise,"
277,THE FOOL,"But soon, with newly opened eyes,"
278,THE FOOL,"Upon your knees,"
279,THE FOOL,You shall discern Heaven's judgment on an age-long ease.
280,THE FOOL,
281,THE FOOL,Poets and prophets darkly sang;
282,THE FOOL,Unheeded then the tocsin rang;
283,THE FOOL,"But now the sky is grey and dim,"
284,THE FOOL,"Your enemy is stern and grim,"
285,THE FOOL,Your leaders slow;
286,THE FOOL,"And, though you realise it not ..."
287,THE FOOL,You may lie low:
288,THE FOOL,"For, though to fight one son is bold,"
289,THE FOOL,"Another hides, amassing gold;"
290,THE FOOL,The strain falls not in equal measure:
291,THE FOOL,Whilst some lie cold--
292,THE FOOL,"Others distil their blood for treasure,"
293,THE FOOL,"And that--Old England--if unchecked,"
294,THE FOOL,Shall see your ancient Empire wrecked.
295,THE FOOL,
296,THE FOOL,"You battle not to vanquish a great nation,"
297,THE FOOL,"Nor for safety, nor the sceptre of the seas,"
298,THE FOOL,"Nor for the Empire of a world at ease,"
299,THE FOOL,Nor fame's fair scroll:
300,THE FOOL,"For your salvation,"
301,THE FOOL,You wrestle with Apollyon for your soul.
302,THE FOOL,
303,THE FOOL,And if you fail--
304,THE FOOL,Your epitaph: 'too late'--
305,THE FOOL,The Angel with the Pen shall grave your fate:
306,THE FOOL,Your glorious history of no avail;
307,THE FOOL,Whilst all the Earth shall know you were not great.
308,THE FOOL,
309,THE FOOL,"Not arms, nor weapons forged, nor serried forces,"
310,THE FOOL,Nor stout Allies nor multiplied resources
311,THE FOOL,The victory giveth;
312,THE FOOL,"Not ships afar, nor numbers gradual tale,"
313,THE FOOL,"Nor all your might, oh Britain! shall avail:"
314,THE FOOL,Only the Spirit liveth!
315,THE FOOL,"Yet this our hope (a hope unsaid),"
316,THE FOOL,"And still our faith (though faith be dead),"
317,THE FOOL,"That, as of old, you may awake,"
318,THE FOOL,"Cast off your senile mood, and shake"
319,THE FOOL,Irresolution to the wall;
320,THE FOOL,Bid equal sacrifice from all;
321,THE FOOL,That each surrender to the state
322,THE FOOL,"A measured offering to fate,"
323,THE FOOL,"Till Unity of Will, controlled"
324,THE FOOL,"Shines through the nation, manifold:"
325,THE FOOL,
326,THE FOOL,"Then should your Spirit conquer as before,"
327,THE FOOL,And Phoenix-like you should renew your youth and strength once more.
328,THE FOOL,
329,THE FOOL,
330,THE FOOL,
331,THE FOOL,
332,THE FOOL,Return
333,THE FOOL,
334,THE FOOL,
335,THE FOOL,"From exile and disaster,"
336,THE FOOL,"From banishment set free,"
337,THE FOOL,"We shall return in sorrow,"
338,THE FOOL,Our homes once more to see.
339,THE FOOL,
340,THE FOOL,"The storm will surely finish,"
341,THE FOOL,"The day must dawn at last,"
342,THE FOOL,"The floods at length diminish,"
343,THE FOOL,The bitterness be past.
344,THE FOOL,
345,THE FOOL,From Fatherland long-banished
346,THE FOOL,"(Oh, church in ruins low!"
347,THE FOOL,"Oh, roofs and chimneys vanished!)"
348,THE FOOL,'Tis to our homes we go!
349,THE FOOL,
350,THE FOOL,"The land is torn asunder,"
351,THE FOOL,The orchard trees are bare;
352,THE FOOL,A muttering of thunder
353,THE FOOL,Still shakes the heavy air.
354,THE FOOL,
355,THE FOOL,Yet life goes on undaunted:
356,THE FOOL,"With aching hearts, and sore,"
357,THE FOOL,To raise our hearths and altars
358,THE FOOL,We shall return once more.

364,THE FOOL,
365,THE FOOL,
366,THE FOOL,In the silence of the night-time
367,THE FOOL,"Startled, we can hear a murmur"
368,THE FOOL,"As of someone tapping, tapping,"
369,THE FOOL,Tapping at the breasts of idols
370,THE FOOL,"With an auscultating hammer,"
371,THE FOOL,Sounding all their hollow vitals
372,THE FOOL,As they helplessly endeavour
373,THE FOOL,To evade with vain pretences
374,THE FOOL,Or atone:
375,THE FOOL,"Yes, we hear the distant thunder"
376,THE FOOL,Of an earthquake that convulses;
377,THE FOOL,"Poor old Mother Earth is shaken,"
378,THE FOOL,"Sorely tried and whirled asunder,"
379,THE FOOL,Shaken by a fierce invader;
380,THE FOOL,"Where grim and slow you creep below,"
381,THE FOOL,"Digging, digging, digging deep,"
382,THE FOOL,"Troglodyte, untiring miner"
383,THE FOOL,All alone!
384,THE FOOL,"As you climb upon the mountains,"
385,THE FOOL,"Glaciers, icy precipices,"
386,THE FOOL,Toward the lonely lightning-blasted
387,THE FOOL,"Peak that towers above in silence,"
388,THE FOOL,Plunging into deep crevasses
389,THE FOOL,Where the frozen water falls:
390,THE FOOL,Monotone:
391,THE FOOL,And at last we wake from nightmare--
392,THE FOOL,"Wake, to find ourselves denuded"
393,THE FOOL,"Naked, lonesome, 'mid our fellows"
394,THE FOOL,"Lacking father, wife, or mother,"
395,THE FOOL,"Lacking neighbour, child or brother:"
396,THE FOOL,All disown.
397,THE FOOL,Still our eyes are fixed steadfastly
398,THE FOOL,"Where you soar above the heavens,"
399,THE FOOL,Spurning with your mighty pinions
400,THE FOOL,"Countless deities and angels,"
401,THE FOOL,Shattering our fondest visions
402,THE FOOL,With your own:
403,THE FOOL,"Ever on your knees you creep,"
404,THE FOOL,Where the way is wild and steep.
405,THE FOOL,"Digging, digging, digging deep,"
406,THE FOOL,Whilst the priests and idols weep.

412,THE FOOL,
413,THE FOOL,
414,THE FOOL,Beloved mine! we cannot falter now;
415,THE FOOL,"No threats avail, no claims affect this hour;"
416,THE FOOL,"That kiss, far more than sacerdotal vow"
417,THE FOOL,"Or golden circlet, making truly one"
418,THE FOOL,--More solemn than any oath--
419,THE FOOL,Hath passed our lips:
420,THE FOOL,"Whilst Love, the great compeller, the mighty power"
421,THE FOOL,"In his bewildering hand, hath seized us both."
422,THE FOOL,
423,THE FOOL,No pardon comes for those who wrongly read
424,THE FOOL,The books on stone engraved--
425,THE FOOL,Our Primal Laws--
426,THE FOOL,Or fail to satisfy the unchanging Cause;
427,THE FOOL,"Who reach this height, and fail, are dead indeed:"
428,THE FOOL,"Their being void, their souls are cast without;"
429,THE FOOL,And from the Book their names are blotted out.
430,THE FOOL,
431,THE FOOL,"There is no holding back, no base endeavour,"
432,THE FOOL,"The cup of true communion is filled,"
433,THE FOOL,The sacrament prepared as we have willed;
434,THE FOOL,Hand joined to hand in clasp that none can sever;
435,THE FOOL,"Our quittance sure, our resolution taken,"
436,THE FOOL,With vows fulfilled we face the world unshaken;
437,THE FOOL,And each to each we pledge ourselves for ever.

449,THE FOOL,They're withered an' wrinkled now wi' old aage;
450,THE FOOL,An' the fire's burnin' low.
451,THE FOOL,
452,THE FOOL,Once I could lether anyone
453,THE FOOL,An' strike a knock-down blow:
454,THE FOOL,"My legs were limmack as a young bough,"
455,THE FOOL,They could race or dance or foller the plough;
456,THE FOOL,"But they're crookled and wemblin' all waays now,"
457,THE FOOL,An' the fire's burnin' low.
458,THE FOOL,
459,THE FOOL,I 'member me of owden daays:
460,THE FOOL,At Metheringham Show:
461,THE FOOL,"I fought young Jolland for a scarf,"
462,THE FOOL,I nearly brok his back in half;
463,THE FOOL,He galloped hooam to Blankney Barff
464,THE FOOL,As hard as he could go.
465,THE FOOL,
466,THE FOOL,"I fought an' danced an' carried on,"
467,THE FOOL,Razzlin 'igh an low;
468,THE FOOL,"I drank as long as I could see,"
469,THE FOOL,"It made noa difference to me,"
470,THE FOOL,I wor a match for any three:
471,THE FOOL,'Tis sixty year ago.
472,THE FOOL,
473,THE FOOL,"They called me 'Fightin' Tomlinson,'"
474,THE FOOL,(My name is Thomas Tow)
475,THE FOOL,I wor the champion o' the sheer;
476,THE FOOL,"If any furriner come near,"

481,THE FOOL,"Noa matter raain nor snow,"
482,THE FOOL,"We gethered in the market plaaces,"
483,THE FOOL,"An' stripped stark naked to our waas'es,"

485,THE FOOL,A Sunday mornin' show!
486,THE FOOL,
487,THE FOOL,"I fought at all the County Fairs,"
488,THE FOOL,From Partney down to Stow;
489,THE FOOL,"They called me nobbut a 'Billinghay Rough,'"
490,THE FOOL,"I niver knawed when I'd 'ed enough,"
491,THE FOOL,"For I wor made o' the proper stuff,"
492,THE FOOL,I'd like to 'ev you know.
493,THE FOOL,

495,THE FOOL,'Tis sixty year ago;

497,THE FOOL,"I wonder as we niver fell,"
498,THE FOOL,"Into the burnin' pit of hell,"
499,THE FOOL,Wheer dreadful fires glow.
500,THE FOOL,
501,THE FOOL,I used to hit like this--but now
502,THE FOOL,I cannot strike a blow:
503,THE FOOL,"My battle's nearly lost--or won,"
504,THE FOOL,"My poor owd limbs is omost done,"

512,THE FOOL,
513,THE FOOL,
514,THE FOOL,We have slaved for you long days and nights of bent and weary lives;
515,THE FOOL,"Giving the strength of our muscles, our sweat, and our sons and wives;"
516,THE FOOL,"With less food than your horses, and homes less warm than your hives."
517,THE FOOL,
518,THE FOOL,We have ploughed and dug and sowed and reaped the seasons through and
519,THE FOOL,"through,"
520,THE FOOL,"We have gathered in your grain and raised the 'Harvest Home' for you,"
521,THE FOOL,Who gave starvation pay to us and kept from us our due.
522,THE FOOL,
523,THE FOOL,"We asked for land and freedom, the right to till our own;"
524,THE FOOL,"To harvest and to garner for ourselves, what we had sown;"
525,THE FOOL,We sought the fruit of our labour; you granted us a stone.
526,THE FOOL,
527,THE FOOL,Who gave our lives to your children? Who pledged our souls to thine?
528,THE FOOL,Who made you Lord and Master and placed us with the kine?
529,THE FOOL,Who gave you leave to drink our sweat and mix our blood with wine?
530,THE FOOL,
531,THE FOOL,"To save the land for your children, who denied their country's wage,"
532,THE FOOL,"Our sons have left their homes to fight, to guard your heritage;"
533,THE FOOL,When they return--Ah! woe to you before their righteous rage.
534,THE FOOL,
535,THE FOOL,"You held the land in sufferance to answer for your right,"
536,THE FOOL,To cherish those beneath you and lead them into fight;
537,THE FOOL,"You have refused all payment, and trampled in your might."
538,THE FOOL,
539,THE FOOL,Our sons shall trample you and yours in their bloody and righteous
540,THE FOOL,"rage,"

543,THE FOOL,heritage.

551,THE FOOL,"A group of men stood watching round the bed,"
552,THE FOOL,"Gazing in sadness at the lion's head,"
553,THE FOOL,"Ugly and massive, coarse, yet noble, too,"
554,THE FOOL,"Transfigured by the power shining through,"
555,THE FOOL,"The steadfast purpose, the unflinching will,"
556,THE FOOL,"Decisive, swift to save alive, or kill,"
557,THE FOOL,"As was required. Aye, and more was there;"
558,THE FOOL,"The tenderness, the pity, all the care"
559,THE FOOL,"Of one who watches o'er his fatherland,"
560,THE FOOL,And bears upon his countenance the brand
561,THE FOOL,Of deep unutterable sorrow burned
562,THE FOOL,"Into his soul, whilst he, the lesson learned"
563,THE FOOL,"That they who wield responsibility,"
564,THE FOOL,"Alas, must always compromising be;"
565,THE FOOL,And to help on the cause they deem divine
566,THE FOOL,Must waver from their ever rigid line.
567,THE FOOL,"The singleness of heart for which they pray,"
568,THE FOOL,Doth bow before expediency each day;
569,THE FOOL,No longer fate allows the choice between
570,THE FOOL,A good or evil course--with answer clean--
571,THE FOOL,"But rather shews two evils to be done,"
572,THE FOOL,And they must boldly choose the lesser one.
573,THE FOOL,
574,THE FOOL,"'Tis this that makes him groan with agony,"
575,THE FOOL,The searching question 'Is it well with me?'
576,THE FOOL,The question that at last must come to all
577,THE FOOL,"When at their end, they wonderingly recall"
578,THE FOOL,This point--or that one--'_Was I justified?
579,THE FOOL,For there--I stepped out of my way for pride
580,THE FOOL,"And there--I stooped, perhaps, to save a friend,"
581,THE FOOL,Or--Pity swayed me over much to bend
582,THE FOOL,"From justice there. Yes, I have always sinned."
583,THE FOOL,Weak! Weak!_'
584,THE FOOL,"Have pity on him now,"
585,THE FOOL,The valley of the shadow dews his brow!
586,THE FOOL,
587,THE FOOL,Then in a half delirium he saw
588,THE FOOL,"A vivid pageant passing through the door,"
589,THE FOOL,"Of all the deeds that he had ever done,"
590,THE FOOL,"Good or bad judgments, battles lost or won;"
591,THE FOOL,"There, in procession wide, all who had died"
592,THE FOOL,"Under his rule, either by civil law,"
593,THE FOOL,"Or by the swifter penalty of war,"
594,THE FOOL,"Passed mournfully, their faces ghastly pale,"
595,THE FOOL,Their gaping wounds accusingly did rail;
596,THE FOOL,"And last of all, stately, refined, and meek,"
597,THE FOOL,"The 'Martyr King,' the obstinate and weak,"
598,THE FOOL,The strangest mixture England ever saw
599,THE FOOL,"Upon her throne (And yet, poor man, he wore"
600,THE FOOL,"His crown with piteous regal dignity,"
601,THE FOOL,Whilst from his hands there slowly dripped the blood
602,THE FOOL,Of countless thousands who in loyalty
603,THE FOOL,Perished beneath his vacillating mood).
604,THE FOOL,Then from those twitching lips there fell again
605,THE FOOL,'Have I done well?' The agonizing pain
606,THE FOOL,"Was clear to those around his bed, and one"
607,THE FOOL,"Answered, astonished, with beseeching tone:"
608,THE FOOL,"'But surely, General, you have done well,"
609,THE FOOL,You over all of us have done most well.'
610,THE FOOL,
611,THE FOOL,But Cromwell with a twisted smile replied
612,THE FOOL,'No!'--as he fought for breath--'I--only--tried!'
613,THE FOOL,"Then closed his eyes, smiled quietly, and died."

653,THE FOOL,
654,THE FOOL,
655,THE FOOL,"The Spring was mild, the air was warm,"
656,THE FOOL,"All green the things upon the farm,"
657,THE FOOL,"The corn put forth its tender sprout,"
658,THE FOOL,The daffodils came bursting out;
659,THE FOOL,"Above the hedge, in skimming flight,"
660,THE FOOL,"The blackbird hardly touched the light,"
661,THE FOOL,Whilst in the meadows lush and green
662,THE FOOL,The lambs and foals at play were seen;
663,THE FOOL,When suddenly the wind turned round
664,THE FOOL,And blew across from 'Deadman's Ground'
665,THE FOOL,(Where Farmer Rogers caught his wife
666,THE FOOL,And killed her with a carving knife)
667,THE FOOL,"The oldest labourers about,"
668,THE FOOL,"Who read the weather inside out,"
669,THE FOOL,"Say, when it comes from out that quarter,"
670,THE FOOL,You know it's nothing else but slaughter;
671,THE FOOL,For when it blows from there by night
672,THE FOOL,"It fills the animals with fright,"
673,THE FOOL,And when it blows from there by day
674,THE FOOL,It drives your happiness away;
675,THE FOOL,"It nips the fruit, it starves the corn,"
676,THE FOOL,And everything that's newly born;
677,THE FOOL,"It sweeps the land with icy breath,"
678,THE FOOL,And strikes all growing things with death.
679,THE FOOL,"The farmer feels his liver growl,"
680,THE FOOL,"And soon his children start to howl,"
681,THE FOOL,Until they wonder why the weather
682,THE FOOL,Can fill a man wi' crazy blether;
683,THE FOOL,"He kicks his dog, then rushes out"
684,THE FOOL,"To sack his foreman with a shout,"
685,THE FOOL,"Growls at his wife, and scolds his daughter"
686,THE FOOL,Because the ducks have left the water;
687,THE FOOL,"He sees the wrack upon the wing,"
688,THE FOOL,And feels his life a wasted thing.
689,THE FOOL,"The labourers, with wrinkled faces,"
690,THE FOOL,"Are keeping in the shady places,"
691,THE FOOL,"Afraid of wind and master, too,"
692,THE FOOL,And very careful what they do.
693,THE FOOL,"Down in the fields, with backs all hunched,"
694,THE FOOL,"The horses and the cattle, bunched,"
695,THE FOOL,Stand by the hedge to miss the blast
696,THE FOOL,That wails and whines and whistles past;
697,THE FOOL,"Their coats are ruffled wrong way round,"
698,THE FOOL,Because it blows off 'Deadman's Ground';
699,THE FOOL,"Their tails are down, their eyes are dull,"
700,THE FOOL,And quiet is the angry bull.
701,THE FOOL,But yet the sky is bright and blue
702,THE FOOL,"With everything of clearest hue,"
703,THE FOOL,The Wolds are close enough to feel:
704,THE FOOL,Their trees and houses cut in steel:
705,THE FOOL,"The sun is tempting with a smile,"
706,THE FOOL,"The wind is slaying with a knife,"
707,THE FOOL,(It aggravated Rogers' bile--
708,THE FOOL,He killed himself upon his wife)
709,THE FOOL,"It kills the young, it kills the old,"
710,THE FOOL,It fells the timid with the bold;
711,THE FOOL,"Swift as a flash, hard as a stone,"
712,THE FOOL,"Sharp as a flint, dry as a bone,"
713,THE FOOL,"It pierces you without a sound,"
714,THE FOOL,The blast that comes from 'Deadman's Ground':
715,THE FOOL,For when the wind is in the East
716,THE FOOL,It's neither fit for man nor beast.

732,THE FOOL,
733,THE FOOL,No more I wade along the fen
734,THE FOOL,"For heron or for water hen,"
735,THE FOOL,Nor hug the bottom of my boat
736,THE FOOL,As to the feeding ducks I'd float;
737,THE FOOL,Nor ambushed laay wi' rovin' eye
738,THE FOOL,To watch like specks agen the sky

746,THE FOOL,"'Tis eighty year sin, as a boy,"
747,THE FOOL,"I first 'elped at the duck decoy,"
748,THE FOOL,An' now--I know but little joy:
749,THE FOOL,The waters roam no more.
750,THE FOOL,
751,THE FOOL,"My feyther knew the hidden ways,"
752,THE FOOL,"Across the waste and marshy maze,"
753,THE FOOL,"He knew each haunt of bird an' fish,"
754,THE FOOL,An' how to find 'em at his wish;
755,THE FOOL,While sometimes in his punt he'd sing
756,THE FOOL,"Until the reedy dykes'd ring,"
757,THE FOOL,But now's the end of everything:
758,THE FOOL,The waters roam no more.
759,THE FOOL,
760,THE FOOL,"When, on a stormy winter's night"
761,THE FOOL,"There stirs a noise, or sudden light,"
762,THE FOOL,"I lay an' pant, to hear 'em shout"
763,THE FOOL,In panic 'coz the water's out;
764,THE FOOL,"For long I look, an' anxious strain;"
765,THE FOOL,"Alas! my hope is allers vain,"
766,THE FOOL,An' sad I go to sleep again:
767,THE FOOL,The waters roam no more.
768,THE FOOL,
769,THE FOOL,"No more the waters roam the land,"
770,THE FOOL,But hid away on every hand
771,THE FOOL,"Are led in channels to the sea,"
772,THE FOOL,"Instead of flowin' fancy free,"
773,THE FOOL,Instead of roarin' fierce an' wild
774,THE FOOL,"The same as when I wor a child,"
775,THE FOOL,They creep imprisoned an' defiled:

808,THE FOOL,
809,THE FOOL,"Old age creeps o'er your wrinkled face,"
810,THE FOOL,Your shoulders droop toward the soil;
811,THE FOOL,"When, faltering, you leave the race,"

813,THE FOOL,
814,THE FOOL,"Oh piteous soul! with none to care,"

857,THE FOOL,"(Mysterious tree, whose knotted base"

861,THE FOOL,"Poised in the ether, to and fro,"
862,THE FOOL,"One moment, hesitating--so--"
863,THE FOOL,Flashing from elfin eyes one glance

869,THE FOOL,Swift wonder child of flame;
870,THE FOOL,"The essence of your being,"

875,THE FOOL,"From whence, you came:"
876,THE FOOL,Fleet as the wind amongst the hills

881,THE FOOL,"At one false step your shrine, before"
882,THE FOOL,"One discord note, one word awry"
883,THE FOOL,You vanish straight from human eye:

932,THE FOOL,"When thatchers all get busy with their pegs,"
933,THE FOOL,"And horses, out at grass, can stretch their legs;"
934,THE FOOL,"When inns at night, are full of tired men,"
935,THE FOOL,Who've had a bumping harvest in the Fen;
936,THE FOOL,"Tis then, tis then, none but a fool would roam;"
937,THE FOOL,"Tis then, tis then, I wish I were at home."
938,THE FOOL,
939,THE FOOL,
940,THE FOOL,
941,THE FOOL,
942,THE FOOL,Give Soldiers a Vote?
943,THE FOOL,
944,THE FOOL,
945,THE FOOL,Give soldiers a vote?
946,THE FOOL,Don't talk so blame silly!
947,THE FOOL,They've gone to the War
948,THE FOOL,To beat Kyzer Billy;
949,THE FOOL,And till that be done
950,THE FOOL,There's plenty of fun.
951,THE FOOL,
952,THE FOOL,The war may be pressing
953,THE FOOL,But--Politics first!
954,THE FOOL,"Let's keep up the Game,"
955,THE FOOL,Though the Heavens should burst;
956,THE FOOL,"Then we're sure of our pay,"
957,THE FOOL,Till the very Last Day.
958,THE FOOL,
959,THE FOOL,Great Scott! Don't you see
960,THE FOOL,How we stand on the brink?
961,THE FOOL,Give soldiers a vote?
962,THE FOOL,They would say what they think;
963,THE FOOL,And from power and pay
964,THE FOOL,We should rapidly sink.
965,THE FOOL,
966,THE FOOL,"So don't talk about it,"
967,THE FOOL,Don't mention it now;
968,THE FOOL,Let the men go to war
969,THE FOOL,And the women to plough;
970,THE FOOL,We Statesmen will govern....
971,THE FOOL,"The Lord, He knows how!"
972,THE FOOL,
973,THE FOOL,
974,THE FOOL,
975,THE FOOL,
976,THE FOOL,Alone
977,THE FOOL,
978,THE FOOL,
979,THE FOOL,How now my heart! At this most fell cross-road
980,THE FOOL,"The night far darker than a pit surrounds,"
981,THE FOOL,And only by the lightning's fitful stroke
982,THE FOOL,Can'st see the perils that beset thy course;
983,THE FOOL,Too clear they loom on searing eyeballs flashed;
984,THE FOOL,Certain thy fate whatever twist or turn;
985,THE FOOL,"Deep tolls a bell beneath the tempest's roar,"
986,THE FOOL,And soon thy long-drawn struggle will be done.
987,THE FOOL,
988,THE FOOL,"Thou art too steeped in artifice, old heart!"
989,THE FOOL,So cunning that thou hardly art discerned:
990,THE FOOL,In caverns never touched by light of day
991,THE FOOL,Thou stirrest unbeknown;
992,THE FOOL,At first as lusty
993,THE FOOL,"As any pliant sapling in the spring,"
994,THE FOOL,Soon as the lonely bull's dark hide
995,THE FOOL,Art hard and bitter; weathered by the storms;
996,THE FOOL,"Cross-grained, bewildered, thy courage slowly failing;"
997,THE FOOL,"Thou standest here: forlorn, dismayed, alone."
998,THE FOOL,
999,THE FOOL,"Thy years have passed away in that Great Search,"
1000,THE FOOL,The quest that bruises hearts on hardest stone;
1001,THE FOOL,"Seeking a refuge from dread loneliness,"
1002,THE FOOL,Some haven where the soul is not bereaved;
1003,THE FOOL,Too often--my heart--hast thou been sorely bruised;
1004,THE FOOL,"And now at last the truth confronts thy gaze,"
1005,THE FOOL,Declared by flash against the pitiless night:
1006,THE FOOL,'The soul must die as it hath lived--alone.'
1007,THE FOOL,Alone! The shuddering echo dies away;
1008,THE FOOL,"No subterfuge, no shelter is there ever,"
1009,THE FOOL,There is no anodyne for weary hearts;
1010,THE FOOL,For him who stands alone at this cross-road
1011,THE FOOL,The only hope is death.
1012,THE FOOL,
1013,THE FOOL,From nothingness to nothingness thou passest!
1014,THE FOOL,As thou wert born--
1015,THE FOOL,"As thou hast lived, so shalt thou die!"
1016,THE FOOL,Death is the only refuge: at his visage
1017,THE FOOL,All other spectres flee. Remorse that teareth
1018,THE FOOL,"Like the undying worm, and Failure,"
1019,THE FOOL,"That sheeted gibberer, his brother,"
1020,THE FOOL,"Who like two hounds have haunted thy abode,"
1021,THE FOOL,Must vanish at his touch:
1022,THE FOOL,"And soon, thy journey done, thy trouble over,"
1023,THE FOOL,Wrapped in the mantle of forgetfulness
1024,THE FOOL,Thou shalt sleep well.

1030,THE FOOL,
1031,THE FOOL,
1032,THE FOOL,"There is but one irrevocable bond,"
1033,THE FOOL,"Heart of my heart! None other counteth here,"
1034,THE FOOL,"All claims beside must fail, however fond,"
1035,THE FOOL,But this is surety never to be broken
1036,THE FOOL,By us Beloved! the eternal token
1037,THE FOOL,Of love made manifest beyond our fear:
1038,THE FOOL,Of sweetest deepest draught the living bowl!
1039,THE FOOL,"Although remorse should tear our hearts in twain,"
1040,THE FOOL,"The world, to part us, rageth now in vain"
1041,THE FOOL,And life new-born through life doth bind us ever:
1042,THE FOOL,Strange incarnation! out of each made whole!
1043,THE FOOL,"No prayer avails, no penances can sever:"
1044,THE FOOL,The Holy Ghost--the Spirit--releaseth never
1045,THE FOOL,When flesh and blood and spirit beget a soul.

1051,THE FOOL,
1052,THE FOOL,
1053,THE FOOL,"This town is Hell, and all the people in it"
1054,THE FOOL,"Are devils, roasting for their sins like cinders;"
1055,THE FOOL,"They've train and tram instead of lark and linnet,"
1056,THE FOOL,"For sun are lamps, for sky are only windows,"
1057,THE FOOL,"They have no air to breathe, no room to rove,"
1058,THE FOOL,And crowd so closely that you cannot move;
1059,THE FOOL,Robbing each other whilst nobody hinders:
1060,THE FOOL,"In towns, there is no Providence above."
1061,THE FOOL,
1062,THE FOOL,"If Providence there is above this city,"
1063,THE FOOL,"The fog and smoke must cover it from pity,"
1064,THE FOOL,"For folk are crazed, and run instead of walking,"
1065,THE FOOL,To catch--they know not what--all nonsense talking.
1066,THE FOOL,Old farm! Old farm! I wish I hadn't left you!
1067,THE FOOL,"And if my time came back, I wouldn't part:"
1068,THE FOOL,"You gave me pleasant thoughts to dwell upon,"
1069,THE FOOL,And peaceful days and quietness of heart.
1070,THE FOOL,
1071,THE FOOL,"For here, no happiness can come at all,"
1072,THE FOOL,The nights are cursed by idle folk at play;
1073,THE FOOL,"Here is no sleepy smell of new mown hay,"
1074,THE FOOL,Or soothing noise of cattle in their stall;
1075,THE FOOL,"No scent of may in bloom, or beans in flower,"
1076,THE FOOL,No drowsy sound of bees among the clover;
1077,THE FOOL,"But only hooters, droning every hour;"
1078,THE FOOL,With smoke and dirt and misery all over.
1079,THE FOOL,
1080,THE FOOL,"Sometimes, when dazed by this un-human place"
1081,THE FOOL,"I have remembered me the days so dear,"
1082,THE FOOL,"And seen again the horses out at plough,"
1083,THE FOOL,Their shoulders pressing forward in the gear:
1084,THE FOOL,"The smell, the sound, come back with strange surprise,"
1085,THE FOOL,To think that I am down Long Martin Fen;
1086,THE FOOL,"It brings the tears into my aching eyes,"
1087,THE FOOL,To dream that I am farming once again.

1091,THE FOOL,
1092,THE FOOL,Timberland Bells
1093,THE FOOL,
1094,THE FOOL,
1095,THE FOOL,I used to hear them faintly
1096,THE FOOL,"Those evening bells for prayer,"
1097,THE FOOL,"Across the fields of Tilney,"
1098,THE FOOL,Beyond the sunset's glare.
1099,THE FOOL,
1100,THE FOOL,"I heard them in my childhood,"
1101,THE FOOL,"Those bells of Timberland,"
1102,THE FOOL,"When I was always happy,"
1103,THE FOOL,Holding my father's hand.
1104,THE FOOL,
1105,THE FOOL,"Enchanted in the distance,"
1106,THE FOOL,"They rode upon the air,"
1107,THE FOOL,Seeming to float from Heaven;
1108,THE FOOL,I knew not how nor where.
1109,THE FOOL,
1110,THE FOOL,"All through life's dusty pathway,"
1111,THE FOOL,"I heard those bells ring out,"
1112,THE FOOL,"A chiming in the distance,"
1113,THE FOOL,"That sung, my path about."
1114,THE FOOL,
1115,THE FOOL,My father--how I miss him--
1116,THE FOOL,"Lies in the churchyard there,"
1117,THE FOOL,He takes my hand no longer
1118,THE FOOL,He knows not how I fare.
1119,THE FOOL,
1120,THE FOOL,But I would give up everything
1121,THE FOOL,"To hold again his hand,"
1122,THE FOOL,And hear across the meadows
1123,THE FOOL,The bells of Timberland.

1128,THE FOOL,'Dame Peach'
1129,THE FOOL,
1130,THE FOOL,
1131,THE FOOL,Old Dame Peach stuck like a leech to any good bargin what fell in
1132,THE FOOL,"her reach,"
1133,THE FOOL,She never let slip what come in her grip: however they turned she
1134,THE FOOL,was ready for each;
1135,THE FOOL,"She'd strip herself bare or sell you her hair, or put up a price"
1136,THE FOOL,"for her best china ware,"
1137,THE FOOL,"Her very own bed in which she was wed would be yours in a second,"
1138,THE FOOL,if only you dare;
1139,THE FOOL,"Of childer she'd lots and would lend you their cots, and although"
1140,THE FOOL,"you'd have backed her to lose in a race,"
1141,THE FOOL,Yet at business she shone when the others wor done; and nobody ever
1142,THE FOOL,could stand in her place.
1143,THE FOOL,
1144,THE FOOL,Among all the men she took care of her-sen and was never alarmed at
1145,THE FOOL,"the roughest of tricks,"
1146,THE FOOL,"She'd sit in a bar suppin' ale from a jar, till a bargain was"
1147,THE FOOL,"driven, her profit to fix."
1148,THE FOOL,Folk knew her all round and none ever was found but at one time or
1149,THE FOOL,"other had met her somehow,"
1150,THE FOOL,A good stand-up fight it was all her delight: she would get up at
1151,THE FOOL,midnight to sell you a cow;
1152,THE FOOL,"She bested the men what came out of the Fen, and the folk from the"
1153,THE FOOL,"Wold they found theirsens sold,"
1154,THE FOOL,While them from the Heath they was allers beneath; for however they
1155,THE FOOL,tried they was out in the cold.
1156,THE FOOL,
1157,THE FOOL,The top of the tree was our Mrs. P. at swapping a horse or a cargo
1158,THE FOOL,"of tea,"
1159,THE FOOL,She'd purchase old wicks or a truckload of bricks or a house full of
1160,THE FOOL,"furniture, just for a spree,"
1161,THE FOOL,"Though she's mounted on high somewhere up in the sky, wherever she"
1162,THE FOOL,"is there is business ahead,"
1163,THE FOOL,But I wish she was back when we'd have a real crack on the friends
1164,THE FOOL,that are gone and the days that are fled;
1165,THE FOOL,When her shop was a store and a thousand things more; with her busy
1166,THE FOOL,in-gathering all she could reach:
1167,THE FOOL,"A jewel, a treasure, a caution, a pleasure: Oh! sadly we miss her,"
1168,THE FOOL,our Old Mrs. Peach.

1173,THE FOOL,Friends
1174,THE FOOL,
1175,THE FOOL,
1176,THE FOOL,"Years ago,"
1177,THE FOOL,Simply ages;
1178,THE FOOL,I don't know
1179,THE FOOL,How the deuce they go:
1180,THE FOOL,Like turning pages!
1181,THE FOOL,
1182,THE FOOL,We're still friends at any rate;
1183,THE FOOL,Nothing can invalidate
1184,THE FOOL,"The fun we had,"
1185,THE FOOL,"Good or bad,"
1186,THE FOOL,"Always together,"
1187,THE FOOL,Not caring whether
1188,THE FOOL,"Earthquake or thunder,"
1189,THE FOOL,Over or under;
1190,THE FOOL,Joy in each heart;
1191,THE FOOL,Singing like thrushes
1192,THE FOOL,Young in bushes:
1193,THE FOOL,Now--we're apart.
1194,THE FOOL,
1195,THE FOOL,I've never been so happy since then:
1196,THE FOOL,"They talk of the love of women and men,"
1197,THE FOOL,It's not half so true as that of friends;
1198,THE FOOL,"Not passionate, not selfish,"
1199,THE FOOL,Never ends ...
1200,THE FOOL,"Not our fault to be forced away,"
1201,THE FOOL,Destiny came:
1202,THE FOOL,A wedge:
1203,THE FOOL,We could not turn its edge;
1204,THE FOOL,And so it fell upon that bitter day.
1205,THE FOOL,
1206,THE FOOL,We might have had such times!
1207,THE FOOL,But--No! No!
1208,THE FOOL,It wouldn't go;
1209,THE FOOL,And after that 'twas never the same;
1210,THE FOOL,"I can't encompass it by rhymes,"
1211,THE FOOL,Halting and tame;
1212,THE FOOL,There it lies--
1213,THE FOOL,Not to be altered by tears or sighs:
1214,THE FOOL,"We meet, stealing;"
1215,THE FOOL,Eyes on the door;
1216,THE FOOL,With banished feeling--
1217,THE FOOL,But--No more!

1226,THE FOOL,The crowd press in; a sight to see;
1227,THE FOOL,"Their mouths agape, their eyes aglow,"
1228,THE FOOL,With morbid curiosity.
1229,THE FOOL,
1230,THE FOOL,"Those twisted limbs, those bandaged faces!"
1231,THE FOOL,Humanity all broken down!
1232,THE FOOL,The ghostly grim procession races:
1233,THE FOOL,Hell's handicraft in London Town.
1234,THE FOOL,
1235,THE FOOL,The bestial throng with pampered eyes--
1236,THE FOOL,Faces of goat or sheep or bull--
1237,THE FOOL,All greedy with a glad surprise
1238,THE FOOL,Of ghoulish horror drinking full.
1239,THE FOOL,
1240,THE FOOL,"Heroic citizens, well nourished,"
1241,THE FOOL,Who feast your eyes:--What sight to see?
1242,THE FOOL,By you the Coliseum flourished;
1243,THE FOOL,"You thronged, as now, round Calvary."
1244,THE FOOL,
1245,THE FOOL,
1246,THE FOOL,
1247,THE FOOL,
1248,THE FOOL,Love not too much
1249,THE FOOL,
1250,THE FOOL,
1251,THE FOOL,Have you too greatly loved?
1252,THE FOOL,Sister take warning!
1253,THE FOOL,"Once let your soul be moved,"
1254,THE FOOL,Sable your mourning;
1255,THE FOOL,"If he be satiate,"
1256,THE FOOL,"Then an ingratiate,"
1257,THE FOOL,Waiteth the dawning.
1258,THE FOOL,
1259,THE FOOL,Shew not the passion
1260,THE FOOL,"That stirs in your veins,"
1261,THE FOOL,Far more alluring
1262,THE FOOL,"To handle the reins,"
1263,THE FOOL,His love ensuring....
1264,THE FOOL,In masculine fashion
1265,THE FOOL,If certain--he wanes.
1266,THE FOOL,
1267,THE FOOL,He the pursuer
1268,THE FOOL,"Must ever press on,"
1269,THE FOOL,Passionate wooer
1270,THE FOOL,Whilst you are a stone;
1271,THE FOOL,"Shew but a touch,"
1272,THE FOOL,Yet never too much
1273,THE FOOL,And the battle is won.
1274,THE FOOL,
1275,THE FOOL,Man is a monster
1276,THE FOOL,"Made to be stroked,"
1277,THE FOOL,Close then your arms
1278,THE FOOL,Cover your charms;
1279,THE FOOL,Great the enticement
1280,THE FOOL,"Of beauties when hidden,"
1281,THE FOOL,Of passion well cloaked.
1282,THE FOOL,
1283,THE FOOL,"Crazed, he shall plead,"
1284,THE FOOL,"For what you yield gladly,"
1285,THE FOOL,"Fiercer his greed,"
1286,THE FOOL,For what you give madly;
1287,THE FOOL,You may have measure
1288,THE FOOL,Of love's burning pleasure
1289,THE FOOL,And still hold your treasure....

1300,THE FOOL,"Who strive and plot and fight and turn about,"
1301,THE FOOL,"Endeavouring to seize some phantom crown,--"
1302,THE FOOL,"Whether of kingdom or of some small town,"
1303,THE FOOL,Or village--or one single home--their own:
1304,THE FOOL,"They stumble, and with hurried steps awry"
1305,THE FOOL,Blindly they miss their opportunity;
1306,THE FOOL,"Whilst, all the time, thy Golden Book is there,"
1307,THE FOOL,Ripe with earth's wisdom; but they only stare
1308,THE FOOL,"Or pass along with stupid scoff and curse,"
1309,THE FOOL,Using thy name for 'scoundrelly' or worse.
1310,THE FOOL,
1311,THE FOOL,Of all those who have striven to endow
1312,THE FOOL,"The world with garnered knowledge, only thou"
1313,THE FOOL,Hast for so long endured of thorns the crown;
1314,THE FOOL,Beneath the feet of swine thy name is thrown;
1315,THE FOOL,And in the streets thy priceless wit doth lie;
1316,THE FOOL,"So that, alone, the stooping passer-by"
1317,THE FOOL,"Undaunted by an epithet, may find;"
1318,THE FOOL,"And treasuring like gold seven times refined,"
1319,THE FOOL,Open the casket with exultant air

1331,THE FOOL,
1332,THE FOOL,Beyond the tortured body's cry
1333,THE FOOL,Dread is the mind's dull misery;

1381,THE FOOL,Stares at me now that soft an' bitter!
1382,THE FOOL,Oh Dear! I wish my man would came!
1383,THE FOOL,"May ague twist, an' strike him dumb!"
1384,THE FOOL,May fairies nip his liver out
1385,THE FOOL,An' leave him nare a tongue to shout.
1386,THE FOOL,"Forsaking me, all loansome here"
1387,THE FOOL,With iverything what's wrong and queer.
1388,THE FOOL,
1389,THE FOOL,"From out my winder, where I sit"
1390,THE FOOL,I see the willows round yon pit:
1391,THE FOOL,Dark Pit where Moller Holmes was found
1392,THE FOOL,"As some said,--accidental drowned!--"
1393,THE FOOL,"But I heard screechin', terrified,"
1394,THE FOOL,About the time he must a died!
1395,THE FOOL,"Having noa bottom, soa they say;"
1396,THE FOOL,It's dreadful secrets there must stay
1397,THE FOOL,Until the Resurrection Day!
1398,THE FOOL,Oh where the Devil is that Tom?
1399,THE FOOL,I'll give him 'pub' when he gits hoam:
1400,THE FOOL,The wind is moanin' round that Pit
1401,THE FOOL,As if somebody wished to flit:
1402,THE FOOL,There's Things in there what stirs by night
1403,THE FOOL,"An' if you see, yer hair turns white;"
1404,THE FOOL,"Around, they say, the Mandrake grows"
1405,THE FOOL,What's pulled at dead of night by _those_
1406,THE FOOL,Who little care although it screams
1407,THE FOOL,To wake poor mortals from their dreams.
1408,THE FOOL,Our parson tells of Powers Evil:
1409,THE FOOL,(An' Providence can't beat the Devil)
1410,THE FOOL,"Where should they laay, but in yon Pit?"
1411,THE FOOL,What makes me squirl to think on it:
1412,THE FOOL,All gashly arms a-reachin' out
1413,THE FOOL,To clamber up yer water spout
1414,THE FOOL,An' reach you through--
1415,THE FOOL,Oh Lor!
1416,THE FOOL,_Who's that?_
1417,THE FOOL,'Tis something comin'
1418,THE FOOL,I hear _it_ hummin'....
1419,THE FOOL,
1420,THE FOOL,My dear good Tom! Thank God it's him!
1421,THE FOOL,I was afraid of something grim--
1422,THE FOOL,I've bin a-wantin' you soa long--
1423,THE FOOL,"You lousy mawkin', stinkin' strong"
1424,THE FOOL,Of beer an' bacca! Off to bed!
1425,THE FOOL,"I'll larn yer, Thomas, who you've wed:"
1426,THE FOOL,"'Fore morn, you'll wish as you was dead."
1427,THE FOOL,
1428,THE FOOL,

1430,THE FOOL,
1431,THE FOOL,One Day
1432,THE FOOL,
1433,THE FOOL,
1434,THE FOOL,"I read you poems all the day,"
1435,THE FOOL,"And all the night I dreamed of you,"
1436,THE FOOL,"Wild nightmares riding sweet sleep through,"
1437,THE FOOL,Whilst all the time I longed to say
1438,THE FOOL,"More tenderly, my roundelay,"
1439,THE FOOL,And ardently with verse to woo.
1440,THE FOOL,
1441,THE FOOL,I read you poems all the day;
1442,THE FOOL,"You gave them up again to me,"
1443,THE FOOL,For all the night I seemed to see
1444,THE FOOL,"Your face a vision on my way,"
1445,THE FOOL,As with the murmuring of streams
1446,THE FOOL,Your voice commingled in my dreams.
1447,THE FOOL,
1448,THE FOOL,I read you poems all the day;
1449,THE FOOL,Ah! would that you could hear me now!
1450,THE FOOL,Accepting the unuttered vow
1451,THE FOOL,My spirit yearned but dare not say:
1452,THE FOOL,Yet still though you are far away
1453,THE FOOL,I read you poems all the day.
1454,THE FOOL,
1455,THE FOOL,
1456,THE FOOL,
1457,THE FOOL,

1604,THE FOOL,
1605,THE FOOL,
1606,THE FOOL,To an old Friend
1607,THE FOOL,
1608,THE FOOL,
1609,THE FOOL,A tongue of lambent living flame
1610,THE FOOL,"Stirs lightly when I hear your name,"
1611,THE FOOL,"Your features delicate and rare,"
1612,THE FOOL,Quiver with every thought you bear;
1613,THE FOOL,It ever was a strange delight
1614,THE FOOL,"To see your charming face alight,"
1615,THE FOOL,To sit with you awhile apart
1616,THE FOOL,"And hear the beating of your heart,"
1617,THE FOOL,Or watch the message from your brain
1618,THE FOOL,Into your eyes then back again.
1619,THE FOOL,
1620,THE FOOL,And still it is my fairest dream--
1621,THE FOOL,"That delicate ethereal gleam,"
1622,THE FOOL,"The fire that played behind your face,"
1623,THE FOOL,Lighting it with such fairy grace;
1624,THE FOOL,Such intuition sweet and wild;
1625,THE FOOL,Why should you always be a child?
1626,THE FOOL,
1627,THE FOOL,You cannot ever hope to grow
1628,THE FOOL,Into a woman; oh dear no!
1629,THE FOOL,The fairies never would allow
1630,THE FOOL,"Such desecration; so that, now,"
1631,THE FOOL,You must be reconciled to stay
1632,THE FOOL,For ever as you are to-day.
1633,THE FOOL,What an enchanting fate is this!
1634,THE FOOL,"Eternally a child to be,"
1635,THE FOOL,Laughing with that untroubled bliss
1636,THE FOOL,That only haunts the fancy free:
1637,THE FOOL,"Yes, yours is happiness indeed;"
1638,THE FOOL,"Barefoot to roam the woodland vale,"
1639,THE FOOL,"All careless, though your feet should bleed"
1640,THE FOOL,Because you hear the nightingale;
1641,THE FOOL,"All heedless, though the thorns should tear,"
1642,THE FOOL,"And though the pain be fierce and wild,"
1643,THE FOOL,For Nature gives to you her kiss;
1644,THE FOOL,And you will always be her child.
1645,THE FOOL,
1646,THE FOOL,
1647,THE FOOL,
1648,THE FOOL,
1649,THE FOOL,Is it finished?
1650,THE FOOL,
1651,THE FOOL,
1652,THE FOOL,"Well--Is it finished,"
1653,THE FOOL,Is the long day-dream done?
1654,THE FOOL,"The battle lost, and won?"
1655,THE FOOL,Has love at length diminished
1656,THE FOOL,And night begun?
1657,THE FOOL,
1658,THE FOOL,Do you pass to another?
1659,THE FOOL,Yet still I hold
1660,THE FOOL,Devotion all untold;
1661,THE FOOL,Although you mate a brother
1662,THE FOOL,And leave me cold.
1663,THE FOOL,
1664,THE FOOL,My heart beats but for thee
1665,THE FOOL,"And every thought is thine,"
1666,THE FOOL,As flowers to the sun incline;
1667,THE FOOL,For once thou lovedst me
1668,THE FOOL,And all was mine.
1669,THE FOOL,
1670,THE FOOL,"Though destiny may banish,"
1671,THE FOOL,My heart is still the same;
1672,THE FOOL,And thine is all my fame;
1673,THE FOOL,"Although thy love may vanish,"
1674,THE FOOL,True burns my flame.
1675,THE FOOL,
1676,THE FOOL,"And, thou mayst know"
1677,THE FOOL,"That shouldst thou call to me,"
1678,THE FOOL,"Where-ever I may be,"
1679,THE FOOL,Like arrow from its bow
1680,THE FOOL,Straight I will fly to thee.
1681,THE FOOL,
1682,THE FOOL,
1683,THE FOOL,
1684,THE FOOL,
1685,THE FOOL,"Oh, Lincoln, City of my dreams"
1686,THE FOOL,
1687,THE FOOL,
1688,THE FOOL,As far away as childhood seems
1689,THE FOOL,"Thou standest on thy Roman hill,"
1690,THE FOOL,"And memory holds thee frozen, still,"
1691,THE FOOL,Engraved on steel where moonlight streams.
1692,THE FOOL,
1693,THE FOOL,For leagues along the landscape mild
1694,THE FOOL,"Thy towers twin the scene command,"
1695,THE FOOL,Embattlements of fairyland;
1696,THE FOOL,Romance incarnate to a child.
1697,THE FOOL,
1698,THE FOOL,"Though other cities cast a spell,"
1699,THE FOOL,Ever thou holdst my heart in chains;
1700,THE FOOL,And still I hear across the plains
1701,THE FOOL,At midnight's stroke that ancient bell
1702,THE FOOL,
1703,THE FOOL,Whose giant throbbing scarcely seems
1704,THE FOOL,A mortal sound at Heaven's gate:
1705,THE FOOL,It echoes round the exile's fate--
1706,THE FOOL,Oh Lincoln! City of my dreams!
1707,THE FOOL,
1708,THE FOOL,
1709,THE FOOL,
1710,THE FOOL,
1711,THE FOOL,The Fool
1712,THE FOOL,
1713,THE FOOL,
1714,THE FOOL,What say?
1715,THE FOOL,Tharp?
1716,THE FOOL,Yis: Aaron Tharp lived theer!
1717,THE FOOL,Not quite sharp?
1718,THE FOOL,Not quite--I fear!
1719,THE FOOL,T'wer very sad!
1720,THE FOOL,Though theer wor summat--'tis hard to say--
1721,THE FOOL,But he come to his end and went away;
1722,THE FOOL,"He'd a nice little place as his feyther made,"
1723,THE FOOL,"All gone to pot, I be much afraid."
1724,THE FOOL,"Old Aaron built it in his day,"
1725,THE FOOL,"A worthy feller true an' sound,"
1726,THE FOOL,Respected by the country round;
1727,THE FOOL,To think as his name should be forgotten!
1728,THE FOOL,If he'd known what a fool he had begotten!
1729,THE FOOL,He toiled an' moiled into his grave
1730,THE FOOL,To leave a lad what couldn't save!
1731,THE FOOL,"Noa note of grace, noa sense of cash!"
1732,THE FOOL,He lost his all be bein' rash!
1733,THE FOOL,
1734,THE FOOL,An' for what!--
1735,THE FOOL,For what!--
1736,THE FOOL,To play the fiddle!
1737,THE FOOL,'Hey diddle diddle!'
1738,THE FOOL,To make up tunes in his empty head
1739,THE FOOL,An' ruin his eyes wi' the books he read!
1740,THE FOOL,He raumed an' babbled all day long
1741,THE FOOL,About the way to sing a song!
1742,THE FOOL,Follered the lads at plough about
1743,THE FOOL,To hear 'em sing would make him shout!
1744,THE FOOL,He'd sit on the bar of the Ship at night:
1745,THE FOOL,"To catch the tunes was his delight,"
1746,THE FOOL,Or to play the fiddle about the town:--
1747,THE FOOL,An' all the while his trade went down!
1748,THE FOOL,That trade what poor old Aaron tended
1749,THE FOOL,It's fell to nowt an' can't be mended
1750,THE FOOL,Coz businesses is all the same
1751,THE FOOL,You've simply got to play the game
1752,THE FOOL,With all your soul an' all your heart
1753,THE FOOL,Or else you'll soon be in the cart.
1754,THE FOOL,
1755,THE FOOL,He was encouraged by our parson!
1756,THE FOOL,T'wer wrong of parson!
1757,THE FOOL,It's very well for them to talk
1758,THE FOOL,"To sing an' play and idle, walk,"
1759,THE FOOL,But aren't they paid for doin' that?
1760,THE FOOL,They mind their bread is buttered fat.
1761,THE FOOL,"Parsons is sensible you see,"
1762,THE FOOL,"O'most as cute as lawyers be,"
1763,THE FOOL,Not quite--a course coz noa one could--
1764,THE FOOL,But very nigh--just as they should.
1765,THE FOOL,"Parsons is sound at heart, I say,"
1766,THE FOOL,"They never quarrels wi' their pay,"
1767,THE FOOL,"Soa it wor wrong of Parson theer,"
1768,THE FOOL,Coz Aaron nobbut lacked a cheer.
1769,THE FOOL,
1770,THE FOOL,"He made his tunes, he played about"
1771,THE FOOL,An' none but Parson had a doubt
1772,THE FOOL,What he was bound for--poor young lad!
1773,THE FOOL,"A course I'll own,--though he wor mad,--"
1774,THE FOOL,"Them tunes he played, them songs he sung,"
1775,THE FOOL,They minded you of bein' young;
1776,THE FOOL,"They took me back, a boy, agen"
1777,THE FOOL,"At work wi' Feyther down the Fen,"
1778,THE FOOL,When all the birds they uster sing
1779,THE FOOL,"At sunrise till the air would ring,"
1780,THE FOOL,And sheep and cows would stir about
1781,THE FOOL,"Wi' everything to make yer shout,"
1782,THE FOOL,"Yes it wor strange what he could do,"
1783,THE FOOL,"His fiddle seemed to mazzle you,"
1784,THE FOOL,The labourers would catch a song--
1785,THE FOOL,An' they _was_ catchy--all along;
1786,THE FOOL,They sing 'em yet; an' Georgy Bell
1787,THE FOOL,He plays 'em by the village well.
1788,THE FOOL,
1789,THE FOOL,"But all the while, trade didn't mend"
1790,THE FOOL,Until at last ther' come the end.
1791,THE FOOL,
1792,THE FOOL,"They selled him up, lock stock an' stoan,"
1793,THE FOOL,"An' off he went away, aloan;"
1794,THE FOOL,Because he sung but couldn't save.
1795,THE FOOL,I think his feyther in the grave
1796,THE FOOL,"Must sure a-stirred, 'owever deep:"
1797,THE FOOL,That smash would waken any sleep!
1798,THE FOOL,Young Aaron went--
1799,THE FOOL,I dunno where--
1800,THE FOOL,"They say he's gone to Manchester,"
1801,THE FOOL,"An' there, mayhap, mid soot an' smoke,"
1802,THE FOOL,Makes music for the city folk;
1803,THE FOOL,"Plays on his fiddle, time, agen"
1804,THE FOOL,Them tunes he larned down Martin Fen
1805,THE FOOL,From shepherds or from waggon-boys
1806,THE FOOL,"Or men at plough,--or any noise:"
