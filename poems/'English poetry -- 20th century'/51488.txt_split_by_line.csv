27,INTRODUCTION,
28,INTRODUCTION,
29,INTRODUCTION,The best poetry is always about the earth itself and all the strange
30,INTRODUCTION,and lovely things that compose and inhabit it. When a 'great poet'
31,INTRODUCTION,"sets himself the task of some 'big theme' he needs only to hold, as"
32,INTRODUCTION,"it were, a magnifying glass to the earth. We who are born and live"
33,INTRODUCTION,"here like very much to imagine other worlds, and we have even mentally"
34,INTRODUCTION,constructed such another in which to exist after dying on this one; but
35,INTRODUCTION,"we were careful to make it a glorified version of our own earth, with"
36,INTRODUCTION,everything we most love here intensified and improved to the utmost
37,INTRODUCTION,stretch of human imagination.
38,INTRODUCTION,
39,INTRODUCTION,To each man his 'best poetry' is that which he is able most to enjoy.
40,INTRODUCTION,"The first object of poetry is to give pleasure. Pleasure is various,"
41,INTRODUCTION,but it cannot exist where the emotions or the imagination have not
42,INTRODUCTION,"been powerfully stirred. Whether it be called sensual or intellectual,"
43,INTRODUCTION,pleasure cannot be willed. It is impossible to feel happy because one
44,INTRODUCTION,"wants to feel happy, or sad because one wishes to feel sad. But such"
45,INTRODUCTION,bodily or mental conditions may be induced from outside through a
46,INTRODUCTION,"natural agency such as poetry, or music."
47,INTRODUCTION,
48,INTRODUCTION,Now those dreary people who would maintain that poetry should deal
49,INTRODUCTION,"(some say exclusively) with what they call 'big themes,' or 'the"
50,INTRODUCTION,"larger life', are merely advocating more use of the magnifying glass"
51,INTRODUCTION,as against intensive cultivation of the natural eye. The poet is
52,INTRODUCTION,"essentially he who examines carefully, and learns to know fully, every"
53,INTRODUCTION,"detail of common life. He seeks to name in a variety of manners, and"
54,INTRODUCTION,"to define, the objects about him, to compare them with other objects,"
55,INTRODUCTION,"near or remote, and to find, for the mere sake of enjoyment, wonderful"
56,INTRODUCTION,varieties of description and comparison. When he imagines better places
57,INTRODUCTION,"than his earth, or invents gods, the impersonation and combination of"
58,INTRODUCTION,"the fortunate qualities in man, he is then using the magnifying glass"
59,INTRODUCTION,"with talent, occasionally with rare genius. But the poet who seeks,"
60,INTRODUCTION,"without genius, to magnify is simply a fool who sees everything too"
61,INTRODUCTION,"big, and boasts, in the loudest voice he can raise, of his diseased"
62,INTRODUCTION,eyesight.
63,INTRODUCTION,
64,INTRODUCTION,"One of the peculiarities, or perhaps rather the essential quality, of"
65,INTRODUCTION,the lyrical poetry of to-day is a minute concentration on the objects
66,INTRODUCTION,immediately near it and an anxious carefulness to describe these in
67,INTRODUCTION,the most appropriate and satisfactory terms. Thus it is often accused
68,INTRODUCTION,"of a neglect to sublimate the emotions, and many critics have been at"
69,INTRODUCTION,pains to suggest that this affection for the nearest and that careful
70,INTRODUCTION,description of natural events denotes a smallness of mental range. Be
71,INTRODUCTION,"it noted, however, that the eye which does not look too far often sees"
72,INTRODUCTION,most. It is remarkable that English lyrical poetry should have learnt
73,INTRODUCTION,in this period of religious uncertainty to clasp itself at least to a
74,INTRODUCTION,reality that cannot be questioned or doubted. So far its faith reaches.
75,INTRODUCTION,"It expresses a trustfulness in what it can definitely perceive, it"
76,INTRODUCTION,"hardly ventures outside the circles of human daily experience, and"
77,INTRODUCTION,"in this capacity it reveals an excellence of many kinds, sincerity"
78,INTRODUCTION,"often, and, at worst, a playfulness which, if ephemeral, is amusing"
79,INTRODUCTION,"at any rate to those whom it is intended to amuse, and appropriately"
80,INTRODUCTION,irritating to those whom it wants to annoy.
81,INTRODUCTION,
82,INTRODUCTION,But the most noticeable characteristic of the verse of our present
83,INTRODUCTION,moment is its dislike of the aloofness generally associated with
84,INTRODUCTION,English poetry. About twice a century language consolidates: phrases
85,INTRODUCTION,which were once soft and new harden with use; words once of a ringing
86,INTRODUCTION,beauty become dry and hollow through excessive repetition. This state
87,INTRODUCTION,of language is not much noticed by people who have no special use
88,INTRODUCTION,"for it beyond the expression of daily needs. Moreover, they make new"
89,INTRODUCTION,colloquial words for themselves as required without forethought or
90,INTRODUCTION,"difficulty. Poets, however, must consciously search for new words, and"
91,INTRODUCTION,a tired condition of their language is to them a great difficulty. The
92,INTRODUCTION,Victorians were absolute spendthrifts of words: no vocabulary could
93,INTRODUCTION,keep pace with their recklessness; they bequeathed a language almost
94,INTRODUCTION,ruined for sentimental purposes--words and phrases had acquired either
95,INTRODUCTION,such an aloofness that for a long time no one any more would trouble
96,INTRODUCTION,"to reach up to them, or had become so thin and common that to use them"
97,INTRODUCTION,would have been something like hack-sawing a piece of cotton.
98,INTRODUCTION,
99,INTRODUCTION,Now in the anthology which follows we may notice a characteristic
100,INTRODUCTION,escape from these difficulties. Words have been brought down from their
101,INTRODUCTION,high places and compelled into ordinary use. This has been accomplished
102,INTRODUCTION,not so much through any new familiarity with the words themselves as
103,INTRODUCTION,by a certain naturalness in the attitude of the people employing them.
104,INTRODUCTION,"Rupert Brooke's ""Great Lover"" is an example."
105,INTRODUCTION,
106,INTRODUCTION,"In short, these are the chief reasons why present-day poetry is"
107,INTRODUCTION,readable and entertaining--that it deals with familiar subjects in a
108,INTRODUCTION,"familiar manner; that, in doing so, it uses ordinary words literally"
109,INTRODUCTION,and as often as possible; that it is not aloof or pretentious; that it
110,INTRODUCTION,"refuses to be bullied by tradition: its style, in fact, is itself."
111,INTRODUCTION,
112,INTRODUCTION,
113,INTRODUCTION,
114,II,II
115,II,
116,II,
117,II,If an excuse is to be sought for the addition of this one more to the
118,II,"large number of existent collections of recent poetry, let it be in"
119,II,"the nature of an explanation rather than an apology. Good, or even"
120,II,"representative, poetry requires, in fact, no apology, but where the"
121,II,poems of some thirty-two different authors have been extracted from
122,II,"their books and placed side by side in one collection, a discussion"
123,II,"of the apparent aims of the anthologist may be interesting, and will"
124,II,perhaps lead to a fuller enjoyment of the collection thus produced.
125,II,
126,II,"Some readers approach a volume of poems to criticize it, others with"
127,II,the object of gaining pleasure. To give pleasure is assuredly the
128,II,"object of this volume. Moreover, it is adapted to the tastes of almost"
129,II,"any age, from ten to ninety, and may be read aloud by grandchild to"
130,II,grandparent as suitably as by grandparent to grandchild. It is an
131,II,"anthology of Poems, not of Names. For instance, though Thomas Hardy"
132,II,"is on the list, the lyric chosen to represent him is actually more"
133,II,characteristic of the book itself than of the mind of that great
134,II,"and aged poet. It is, in fact, Christian in atmosphere. It is not a"
135,II,typical specimen of Mr Hardy's style. It shows him in that occasional
136,II,rather sad mood of regret for a lost superstition. It is not the
137,II,"best of Hardy, but rather a poem admirably suited to the book, which"
138,II,"also happens, as by chance, to be by the author of ""The Dynasts"" and"
139,II,"""Satires of Circumstance."""
140,II,
141,II,
142,II,
143,III,III
144,III,
145,III,
146,III,"The collection as a whole is modern, and all except eight of its"
147,III,"authors are living and writing. Of those eight, five died as soldiers"
148,III,"in the European War, and are represented mainly by what is known as"
149,III,'War poetry.' Otherwise such poetry is fortunately absent. This absence
150,III,may be justified by the fact that most of the verse written on the
151,III,"subject of the War turns out, surveyed in cooler blood, to be, as"
152,III,"any sound judge of literature must always have known, definitely and"
153,III,"unmistakably bad. Much of it is by now, or should be, repudiated by"
154,III,"its authors. It was too often ""the spontaneous overflow of powerful"
155,III,"feelings""; it too seldom originated from ""emotion recollected in"
156,III,"tranquillity."""
157,III,
158,III,"Rupert Brooke's sonnets ""The Dead"" and ""The Soldier"" were popular"
159,III,almost from their first publication. They belong undoubtedly to the
160,III,"best traditions of English poetry. Julian Grenfell's ""Into Battle,"""
161,III,"and, in a lesser, degree, the ""Home Thoughts from Laventie"" of Edward"
162,III,"Wyndham Tennant, have acquired popularity among a larger number of folk"
163,III,than can be included in the general term 'literary circles.' Neither of
164,III,the composers of these verses was a professional poet. Both were men of
165,III,"attractive personality and strong feeling, with education, taste, and"
166,III,an occasional impulse to write gracefully. Intrinsically either poem
167,III,might as easily have been inspired by an Indian frontier raid as by a
168,III,European war. They do not affect the traditions of English poetry by
169,III,"subject or by form. It will be found, as the years pass, that always"
170,III,"fewer 'War poems' can still be read with pleasure, the incidents which"
171,III,gave rise to them having become dim in human memory. And these will not
172,III,"be read because of their association with the Great War, but for their"
173,III,qualities as poems and their power to stir enjoyment or surprise in the
174,III,reader.
175,III,
176,III,Consider those four melancholy lines by which Edward Thomas is here
177,III,"represented, remarkable for their concentration and for the crowd of"
178,III,"images they can suggest. At present the words ""where all that passed"
179,III,"are dead"" alone associate this poem with the War. But death comes"
180,III,through so many causes that twenty years from now a footnote would be
181,III,needed if it were desired to emphasize that association.
182,III,
183,III,"J.E. Flecker's ""Dying Patriot,"" one of his three poems in this book,"
184,III,"was written in 1914 in Switzerland, where he was dying of consumption."
185,III,"It is certainly less a 'War poem' than the same author's ""War Song of"
186,III,"the Saracens."""
187,III,
188,III,"The verses entitled ""A Petition,"" by R. E. Vernède, are of a different"
189,III,"kind. They are written in conventional Henley-Kiplingese, and contain"
190,III,too many incidents of a type of poetic expression that has been used
191,III,"to excess, as ""wider than all seas,"" ""to front the world,"" ""quenchless"
192,III,"hope"" ""All that a man might ask thou hast given me, England!"" They are,"
193,III,"nevertheless, useful in the collection as a set-off against the other"
194,III,'War poems' and an instance of the more ephemeral type of patriotic
195,III,verse.
196,III,
197,III,Thus it would appear that the anthologist has displayed wisdom when
198,III,including in this volume only few pieces that may be associated with
199,III,"the War, and those few (with one exception) on the score of their"
200,III,"literary merit, and for no other reason."
201,III,
202,III,
203,IV,IV
204,IV,
205,IV,
206,IV,"Poets of to-day write individually less than their pre-decessors, and"
207,IV,most of them are satisfied to publish only a proportion of what they
208,IV,write. None of the eight referred to above left us any great bulk of
209,IV,"verse. Four at least, however, are becoming daily better known to the"
210,IV,"reading public, and of these Rupert Brooke and J. E. Flecker have"
211,IV,"already their dozens of conscious or unconscious imitators. The form,"
212,IV,"rhythm, or Eastern atmosphere of Fleckers poetry, the cynicism and"
213,IV,"wit of Brooke's, recur somewhat diluted in the verse of almost every"
214,IV,young undergraduate. Neither Lionel Johnson nor Mary Coleridge has ever
215,IV,become so well known or received so much attention from the average
216,IV,"plagiarist, while the reputation of Edward Thomas has been of slow and"
217,IV,uncertain growth. Johnsons poetry is too intellectual for the average
218,IV,"reader. The wonderful, small lyrics of Mary Coleridge are esoteric"
219,IV,"rather than general. Nevertheless, this anthology includes, most"
220,IV,"advisedly, a good poem by Johnson, one indeed which has had a quiet,"
221,IV,"but strong, influence on modern lyrical poetry, namely, the lines"
222,IV,"to the statue of King Charles at Charing Cross, and also a charming"
223,IV,impression by Mary Coleridge.
224,IV,
225,IV,"""Street Lanterns"" is a good example of that poetry of close observation"
226,IV,"to which reference has already been made. It is a small, careful"
227,IV,description of a London scene. It assumes that the reader has observed
228,IV,"as much, and that he will enjoy to be reminded and brought back for"
229,IV,a moment in imagination to autumn and street-mending. The advocate of
230,IV,"'big themes' will inevitably condemn such verse, for the poet has aimed"
231,IV,"at neither size nor grandeur, has indeed sought rather to diminish her"
232,IV,subject than enlarge it.
233,IV,
234,IV,
235,IV,
236,V,V
237,V,
238,V,
239,V,"This anthology, it has been remarked above, is one rather of particular"
240,V,poems than of well-known authors. Several names of repute are not to
241,V,"be found in the index. William Watson is only represented by ""April,"""
242,V,a little catch that might come to any man of feeling on a spring walk.
243,V,To think in terms of these verses is at once not to mind having left
244,V,an umbrella at home. Hilaire Belloc gives a sharp impression of early
245,V,rising; he also sings in a great voice all the glories of his favourite
246,V,"part of England. W. H. Davies brings sheep across the Atlantic, and"
247,V,"he talks to a kingfisher. Mrs Meynell contributes ""The Shepherdess,"""
248,V,"that well-known description of a fine and serene mind, also two London"
249,V,"poems, of which one is the lovely ""November Blue."" John Masefield is"
250,V,"not to be read in his best style, but the three poems we find here are"
251,V,"thoroughly English, full of the love of the island soil and of its sea,"
252,V,and are probably in the book for that reason. So much for some of the
253,V,well-known contributors. Side by side with them we find the unknown
254,V,"name of H. H. Abbott, whose ""Black and White"" is a sketch of remarkable"
255,V,clarity and interest.
256,V,
257,V,"Death, so favourite a subject with poets, is seldom allowed to figure"
258,V,"in this book. Betsey-Jane would insist on going to Heaven, but is told,"
259,V,"in the charming verses by Helen Parry Eden, that it simply ""would not"
260,V,"do."" The whole book is too full of pleasure and the experience of being"
261,V,alive: Betsey-Jane should read it. She might remember all her life the
262,V,"advice given on page 117, and be saved hundreds of pounds in lawyers'"
263,V,bills when she is grown up.
264,V,
265,V,Let the reader turn to page 114. Here is the style in which good poetry
266,V,"prefers to teach, and by which it achieves more in eleven lines than a"
267,V,"Martin Tupper in 11,000. Mr Pepler has written down only one sentence,"
268,V,charmingly improved by a series of most natural rhymes. It is a very
269,V,"nasty hit at the lawyer. He does not tell him he is not a 'gentleman',"
270,V,or anything so strong as that. He pays him what might be taken for a
271,V,compliment. He assumes that he does understand his own job. Then he
272,V,enumerates the things he does not understand. He attaches no blame: he
273,V,makes a statement only; one that the lawyer certainly will not think
274,V,"worth arguing about, but that his client may advisedly take to heart."
275,V,
276,V,"Ralph Hodgson's ""Stupidity Street"" argues in somewhat the same manner."
277,V,"It does not suggest that anyone should become vegetarian, or that it is"
278,V,wrong to kill birds. It names a street and gives a reason for doing so.
279,V,"It is an angry little Poem, but impersonal."
280,V,
281,V,"""The Bells of Heaven,"" by the same author, simply chances a hint that"
282,V,"something might happen if something else did. It is a suggestion only,"
283,V,"but made by one who knows what he thinks, and how to think it. Into a"
284,V,few lines a whole philosophy is concentrated.
285,V,
286,V,Thus Pepler or Ralph Hodgson nudge peoples arms and draw attention to
287,V,traditional stupidities.
288,V,
289,V,"Walter De la Mare puts the children to sleep with ""Nod,"" or bewitches"
290,V,them with the Mad Prince's Song; or he takes us to an Arabia which
291,V,"never existed, but is one of those countries more beautiful than any we"
292,V,"know, and therefore we love to imagine it."
293,V,
294,V,"Look at that full moon on page 53, which Dick saw ""one night."" Here is"
295,V,"the possible experience of man, woman, child, dog, fox, bear--or even"
296,V,nightingale--all concentrated into the shortest and plainest account
297,V,"of something that happened to Dick. He and Betsey-Jane, though quite"
298,V,"different in kind, belong to the same world. Betsey-Jane is plainly"
299,V,more romantic than Dick.
300,V,
301,V,"But, talking of the moon, we may turn back to Mr Chesterton on page"
302,V,36. Here we find something incongruous in the collection: a poem
303,V,that wishes deliberately to strike a note. The donkey is a much
304,V,better fellow than Mr Chesterton seems to think: he does not ask for
305,V,"glorification, nor would he utter that boast of the last two lines."
306,V,"Would a man not rather ""go with the wild asses to Paradise"" than have"
307,V,the case for the donkey pleaded before him in this obtrusive manner?
308,V,
309,V,Turn back four pages and you will find:
310,V,
311,V,"For the good are always the merry,"
312,V,"Save by an evil chance,"
313,V,"And the merry love the fiddle,"
314,V,And the merry love to dance.
315,V,
316,V,"This, by W. B. Yeats, represents a much pleasanter type of thought. In"
317,V,"these verses of the Irish poet we have the gaiety of a man who, knowing"
318,V,"all about religion, can afford not to be sentimental. And here is the"
319,V,spirit of the book.
320,V,
321,V,The happiness of those who love the earth is so different from the
322,V,pleasure by proxy of those that abide it in the idea of going to some
323,V,"Heaven afterward. Mr Yeats' ""Fiddler of Dooney"" is that type of fellow"
324,V,who accepts the symbolism of a national religion only in so far as it
325,V,"may help him to enjoy the condition of being alive. And in his ""Lake"
326,V,"Isle of Innisfree"" he imagines a Paradise which is of the earth only."
327,V,And he takes you there by reason of his own longing.
328,V,

333,VI,
334,VI,"This anthology, as a whole, is romantic ; its language is simple; its"
335,VI,"philosophy is that of everyday life, and is entirely undisturbing."
336,VI,It contains a large proportion of poems by authors who write more
337,VI,"particularly for children, such as P. R. Chalmers, Rose Fyleman,"
338,VI,"Queenie Scott-Hopper, and Marion St John Webb, or of children's poems"
339,VI,"by authors who do not actually specialize in that style, such as ""The"
340,VI,"Ragwort,"" by Frances Cornford; ""Cradle Song,"" by Sarojini Naidu;"
341,VI,"""Check,"" by James Stephens, and others. Two of its authors remain"
342,VI,"necessarily unmentioned here, namely, the compiler of the book and the"
343,VI,writer of this Introduction.
344,VI,
345,VI,"Some people make it their business to pick anthologies to pieces,"
346,VI,"and they seem to enjoy themselves. ""Why is this included?"" they cry;"
347,VI,"""Why is that left out?""--a form of criticism nearly always beside the"
348,VI,point. Inclusion or exclusion is in the taste and discretion of the
349,VI,anthologist.
350,VI,
351,VI,"This Introduction may, it is hoped, stimulate the reader of the poems"
352,VI,which follow to think about them carefully in their relation to
353,VI,"each other, and in their relation to English poetry as a whole. For"
354,VI,though it has frequently been emphasized that the object of poetry
355,VI,"(and particularly of lyrical poetry) is to give pleasure, it should"
356,VI,nevertheless be added that intellectual pleasure cannot be gathered at
357,VI,"random, or without certain preparation of the mind to receive it."

819,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
820,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,When I am living in the Midlands
821,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"That are sodden and unkind,"
822,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,I light my lamp in the evening:
823,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,My work is left behind;
824,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the great hills of the South Country
825,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Come back into my mind.
826,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
827,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,The great hills of the South Country
828,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,They stand along the sea;
829,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And it's there walking in the high woods
830,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"That I could wish to be,"
831,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the men that were boys when I was a boy
832,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Walking along with me.
833,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
834,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,The men that live in North England
835,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,I saw them for a day:
836,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"Their hearts are set upon the waste fells,"
837,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Their skies are fast and grey;
838,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,From their castle-walls a man may see
839,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,The mountains far away.
840,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
841,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,The men that live in West England
842,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"They see the Severn strong,"
843,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,A-rolling on rough water brown
844,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Light aspen leaves along.
845,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"They have the secret of the Rocks,"
846,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the oldest kind of song.
847,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
848,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,But the men that live in the South Country
849,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"Are the kindest and most wise,"
850,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"They get their laughter from the loud surf,"
851,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the faith in their happy eyes
852,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Comes surely from our Sister the Spring
853,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,When over the sea she flies;
854,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"The violets suddenly bloom, at her feet,"
855,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,She blesses us with surprise.
856,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
857,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,I never get between the pines
858,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,But I smell the Sussex air;
859,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Nor I never come on a belt of sand
860,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,But my home is there.
861,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And along the sky the line of the Downs
862,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,So noble and so bare.
863,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
864,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"A lost thing could I never find,"
865,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Nor a broken thing mend:
866,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And I fear I shall be all alone
867,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,When I get towards the end.
868,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Who will be there to comfort me
869,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Or who will be my friend?
870,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
871,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,I will gather and carefully make my friends
872,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"Of the men of the Sussex Weald,"
873,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"They watch the stars from silent folds,"
874,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,They stiffly plough the field.
875,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,By them and the God of the South Country
876,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,My poor soul shall be healed.
877,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
878,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"If I ever become a rich man,"
879,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"Or if ever I grow to be old,"
880,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,I will build a house with deep thatch
881,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"To shelter me from the cold,"
882,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And there shall the Sussex songs be sung
883,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the story of Sussex told.
884,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
885,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,I will hold my house in the high wood
886,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"Within a walk of the sea,"
887,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the men that were boys when I was a boy
888,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Shall sit and drink with me.

1347,THE GREAT LOVER,I have been so great a lover: filled my days
1348,THE GREAT LOVER,"So proudly with the splendour of Love's praise,"
1349,THE GREAT LOVER,"The pain, the calm, and the astonishment,"
1350,THE GREAT LOVER,"Desire illimitable, and still content,"
1351,THE GREAT LOVER,"And all dear names men use, to cheat despair,"
1352,THE GREAT LOVER,For the perplexed and viewless streams that bear
1353,THE GREAT LOVER,Our hearts at random down the dark of life.
1354,THE GREAT LOVER,"Now, ere the unthinking silence on that strife"
1355,THE GREAT LOVER,"Steals down, I would cheat drowsy Death so far,"
1356,THE GREAT LOVER,My night shall be remembered for a star
1357,THE GREAT LOVER,That outshone all the suns of all men's days.
1358,THE GREAT LOVER,Shall I not crown them with immortal praise
1359,THE GREAT LOVER,"Whom I have loved, who have given me, dared with me"
1360,THE GREAT LOVER,"High secrets, and in darkness knelt to see"
1361,THE GREAT LOVER,The inenarrable godhead of delight?
1362,THE GREAT LOVER,Love is a flame;--we have beaconed the world's night.
1363,THE GREAT LOVER,"A city:--and we have built it, these and I."
1364,THE GREAT LOVER,An emperor:--we have taught the world to die.
1365,THE GREAT LOVER,"So, for their sakes I loved, ere I go hence,"
1366,THE GREAT LOVER,"And the high cause of Love's magnificence,"
1367,THE GREAT LOVER,"And to keep loyalties young, I'll write those names"
1368,THE GREAT LOVER,"Golden for ever, eagles, crying flames,"
1369,THE GREAT LOVER,"And set them as a banner, that men may know,"
1370,THE GREAT LOVER,"To dare the generations, burn, and blow"
1371,THE GREAT LOVER,"Out on the wind of Time, shining and streaming...."
1372,THE GREAT LOVER,These I have loved:
1373,THE GREAT LOVER,"White plates and cups, clean-gleaming,"
1374,THE GREAT LOVER,"Ringed with blue lines; and feathery, faery dust;"
1375,THE GREAT LOVER,"Wet roofs, beneath the lamp-light; the strong crust"
1376,THE GREAT LOVER,Of friendly bread; and many-tasting food;
1377,THE GREAT LOVER,Rainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of wood;
1378,THE GREAT LOVER,And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers;
1379,THE GREAT LOVER,"And flowers themselves, that sway through sunny hours,"
1380,THE GREAT LOVER,Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon;
1381,THE GREAT LOVER,"Then, the cool kindliness of sheets, that soon"
1382,THE GREAT LOVER,Smooth away trouble; and the rough male kiss
1383,THE GREAT LOVER,Of blankets; grainy wood; live hair that is
1384,THE GREAT LOVER,Shining and free; blue-massing clouds; the keen
1385,THE GREAT LOVER,Unpassioned beauty of a great machine;
1386,THE GREAT LOVER,The benison of hot water; furs to touch;
1387,THE GREAT LOVER,The good smell of old clothes; and other such--
1388,THE GREAT LOVER,"The comfortable smell of friendly fingers,"
1389,THE GREAT LOVER,"Hair's fragrance, and the musty reek that lingers"
1390,THE GREAT LOVER,About dead leaves and last year's ferns....

1398,THE GREAT LOVER,Holes in the ground; and voices that do sing;
1399,THE GREAT LOVER,"Voices in laughter, too; and body's pain,"
1400,THE GREAT LOVER,Soon turned to peace; and the deep-panting train;
1401,THE GREAT LOVER,Firm sands; the little dulling edge of foam
1402,THE GREAT LOVER,That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home;
1403,THE GREAT LOVER,"And washen stones, gay for an hour; the cold"
1404,THE GREAT LOVER,Graveness of iron; moist black earthen mould;
1405,THE GREAT LOVER,Sleep; and high places; footprints in the dew;
1406,THE GREAT LOVER,"And oaks; and brown horse-chestnuts, glossy-new;--"
1407,THE GREAT LOVER,And new-peeled sticks; and shining pools on grass;--
1408,THE GREAT LOVER,All these have been my loves. And these shall pass.
1409,THE GREAT LOVER,"Whatever passes not, in the great hour,"
1410,THE GREAT LOVER,"Nor all my passion, all my prayers, have power"
1411,THE GREAT LOVER,To hold them with me through the gate of Death.
1412,THE GREAT LOVER,"They'll play deserter, turn with the traitor breath,"
1413,THE GREAT LOVER,"Break the high bond we made, and sell Love's trust"
1414,THE GREAT LOVER,And sacramented covenant to the dust.
1415,THE GREAT LOVER,"--Oh, never a doubt but, somewhere, I shall wake,"
1416,THE GREAT LOVER,"And give what's left of love again, and make"

1418,THE GREAT LOVER,"But the best I've known,"
