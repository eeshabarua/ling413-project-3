117,SONGS,_Song for an Unwritten Play._
118,SONGS,
119,SONGS,"The moon's a drowsy fool to-night,"
120,SONGS,Wrapped in fleecy clouds and white;
121,SONGS,And all the while Endymion
122,SONGS,Sleeps on Latmos top alone.
123,SONGS,
124,SONGS,Not a single star is seen:
125,SONGS,"They are gathered round their queen,"
126,SONGS,"Keeping vigil by her bed,"
127,SONGS,Patient and unwearièd.
128,SONGS,
129,SONGS,Now the poet drops his pen
130,SONGS,And moves about like other men:
131,SONGS,Tom o' Bedlam now is still
132,SONGS,And sleeps beneath the hawthorn'd hill.
133,SONGS,
134,SONGS,Only the Latmian shepherd deems
135,SONGS,Something missing from his dreams
136,SONGS,And tosses as he sleeps alone.
137,SONGS,"Alas, alas, Endymion!"
138,SONGS,
139,SONGS,
140,SONGS,
141,SONGS,
142,SONGS,_The Cup._
143,SONGS,
144,SONGS,As a hot traveller
145,SONGS,"Going through stones and sands,"
146,SONGS,Who sees clear water stir
147,SONGS,"Amid the weary lands,"
148,SONGS,Takes in his hollowed hands
149,SONGS,"The clean and lively water,"
150,SONGS,That trickles down his throat
151,SONGS,"Like laughter, like laughter,"
152,SONGS,
153,SONGS,So when you come to me
154,SONGS,Across these parchèd places
155,SONGS,And all the waste I see
156,SONGS,"Flowered with your graces,"
157,SONGS,I take between my hands
158,SONGS,"Your face like a rare cup,"
159,SONGS,"Where kisses mix with laughter,"
160,SONGS,And drink and drink them up
161,SONGS,"Like water, like water."
162,SONGS,
163,SONGS,
164,SONGS,
165,SONGS,
166,SONGS,_A Rhymeless Song._
167,SONGS,
168,SONGS,Rhyme with its jingle still betrays
169,SONGS,The song that's meant for one alone.
170,SONGS,"Dearest, I dedicate to you"
171,SONGS,A little song without a rhyme.
172,SONGS,
173,SONGS,The most unpractised schoolboy knows
174,SONGS,That quiet kisses are the sweetest.
175,SONGS,"Safe locked within my arms you lie,"
176,SONGS,Let not a single sound betray us.
177,SONGS,
178,SONGS,Suppose your jealous mother came
179,SONGS,By chance this way and found us here...
180,SONGS,"Be still, be still, and not a sound"
181,SONGS,Shall give her warning that we love.
182,SONGS,
183,SONGS,
184,SONGS,
185,SONGS,
186,SONGS,_Meadow and Orchard._
187,SONGS,
188,SONGS,"My heart is like a meadow,"
189,SONGS,"Where clouds go over,"
190,SONGS,Dappling the mingled grass and clover
191,SONGS,"With mingled sun and shadow,"
192,SONGS,With light that will not stay
193,SONGS,And shade that sails away.
194,SONGS,
195,SONGS,"Your heart is like an orchard,"
196,SONGS,"That has the sun for ever in its leaves,"
197,SONGS,"Where, on the grass beneath the trees,"
198,SONGS,There falls the shadow of the fruit
199,SONGS,That ripen there for me.
200,SONGS,
201,SONGS,
202,SONGS,
203,SONGS,
204,SONGS,_Who thinks that he possesses._
205,SONGS,
206,SONGS,Who thinks that he possesses
207,SONGS,His mistress with his kisses
208,SONGS,Knows neither love nor her.
209,SONGS,Nor beauty is not his
210,SONGS,Who seeks it in a kiss:
211,SONGS,If you would seek for this
212,SONGS,O seek it otherwhere!
213,SONGS,
214,SONGS,"Love is a flame, a spirit"
215,SONGS,Beyond all earthly merit
216,SONGS,And all we dream of here;
217,SONGS,Strive as you may but still
218,SONGS,"Love is intangible,"
219,SONGS,No servant to your will
220,SONGS,But sovereign otherwhere.
221,SONGS,
222,SONGS,
223,SONGS,
224,SONGS,
225,SONGS,_Love in the Open Air._
226,SONGS,
227,SONGS,I'll love you in the open air
228,SONGS,But stuffy rooms and blazing fires
229,SONGS,And mirrors with familiar stare
230,SONGS,Cloak and befoul my high desires.
231,SONGS,
232,SONGS,The dearest day that I have known
233,SONGS,"Was in the fields, when driving rain"
234,SONGS,"Was like a veil around us thrown,"
235,SONGS,A grey close veil without a stain.
236,SONGS,
237,SONGS,The young oak-tree was stripped and bare
238,SONGS,"But naked twigs a shelter made,"
239,SONGS,Where curious cows came round to stare
240,SONGS,And stood astonished and dismayed.
241,SONGS,
242,SONGS,"Let it be rain or summer sun,"
243,SONGS,"Smell of wet earth or scent of flowers,"
244,SONGS,"Love, once more give me, give me one"
245,SONGS,Of these enchanted lover's hours.
246,SONGS,
247,SONGS,
248,SONGS,
249,SONGS,
250,SONGS,_Fear in the Night._
251,SONGS,
252,SONGS,"I am afraid to-night,"
253,SONGS,"We are too glad, too gay,"
254,SONGS,"Our life too sweet, too bright"
255,SONGS,To last another day.
256,SONGS,
257,SONGS,"What hap, what chance can fall,"
258,SONGS,"What sorrow come, what schism,"
259,SONGS,"What loss, what cataclysm"
260,SONGS,To part us two at all?
261,SONGS,
262,SONGS,The stars with ageless fire
263,SONGS,In skies serene the same
264,SONGS,Observe our young desire
265,SONGS,And watch our loves aflame.
266,SONGS,
267,SONGS,"A whisper soft, a sound"
268,SONGS,"Unfollowed, unattended,"
269,SONGS,Shakes all the branches round:
270,SONGS,They sleep and it is ended.
271,SONGS,
272,SONGS,You sleep and I alone
273,SONGS,Torment myself with fear
274,SONGS,For new joys coming near
275,SONGS,And gracious actions done.
276,SONGS,
277,SONGS,"I am afraid to-night,"
278,SONGS,"We are too glad, too gay,"
279,SONGS,"Our life too sweet, too bright"
280,SONGS,To last another day.
281,SONGS,
282,SONGS,
283,SONGS,
284,SONGS,
285,SONGS,_An Old Song._
286,SONGS,
287,SONGS,The wild duck fly over
288,SONGS,From river to river
289,SONGS,And so the young lover
290,SONGS,Goes roving for ever.
291,SONGS,
292,SONGS,"They fly together,"
293,SONGS,He walks alone:
294,SONGS,No maiden can tether
295,SONGS,Him with her moan.
296,SONGS,
297,SONGS,At the bursting of blossom
298,SONGS,On her breast his head;
299,SONGS,He has left her bosom
300,SONGS,Ere the apples are red.
301,SONGS,
302,SONGS,"Across the valley,"
303,SONGS,Singing he goes.
304,SONGS,In highway and alley
305,SONGS,He seeks a new rose.
306,SONGS,
307,SONGS,"Tell me, O maidens,"
308,SONGS,You who all day
309,SONGS,In lyrical cadence
310,SONGS,"Dance and play,"
311,SONGS,
312,SONGS,Why do you proffer
313,SONGS,"Your sweets to one,"
314,SONGS,Who takes all you offer
315,SONGS,And leaves you to moan?
316,SONGS,
317,SONGS,
318,SONGS,
319,SONGS,
320,SONGS,_Love's Close._
321,SONGS,
322,SONGS,Now spring comes round again
323,SONGS,"With blossom on the tree,"
324,SONGS,"Dark blossom of the peach,"
325,SONGS,Light blossom of the pear
326,SONGS,And amorous birds complain
327,SONGS,And nesting birds prepare
328,SONGS,And love's keen fingers reach
329,SONGS,After the heart of me.
330,SONGS,
331,SONGS,But now the blackthorn blows
332,SONGS,About the dusty lane
333,SONGS,"And new buds peep and peer,"
334,SONGS,"I have no joy at all,"
335,SONGS,For love draws near its close
336,SONGS,And love's white blossoms fall
337,SONGS,And in the springing year
338,SONGS,Love's fingers bring me pain.
339,SONGS,
340,SONGS,
341,SONGS,
342,SONGS,
343,SONGS,_The Weed._
344,SONGS,
345,SONGS,My mother told me this for true
346,SONGS,"That there behind the mountains,"
347,SONGS,That wear the mists about their feet
348,SONGS,"And clouds about their summits,"
349,SONGS,"There grows the weed Forgetfulness,"
350,SONGS,It grows there in the gullies.
351,SONGS,
352,SONGS,"If I but knew the way thereto,"
353,SONGS,Three days long would I wander
354,SONGS,And pick a handful of the weed
355,SONGS,"And drink it steeped in honey,"
356,SONGS,That so I might forget your mouth
357,SONGS,A thousand times that kissed me.
358,SONGS,
359,SONGS,
360,SONGS,
361,SONGS,
362,SONGS,_Recollection._
363,SONGS,
364,SONGS,"Hawthorn above, as pale as frost,"
365,SONGS,Against the paling sky is lost:
366,SONGS,"On the pool's dark sheet below,"
367,SONGS,The candid water-daisies glow.
368,SONGS,
369,SONGS,As I came up and saw from far
370,SONGS,"The water littered, star on star,"
371,SONGS,I thought the may had left its hedge
372,SONGS,To float upon the pool's dark edge.
373,SONGS,
374,SONGS,
375,SONGS,
376,SONGS,
377,SONGS,_The Holiday._
378,SONGS,
379,SONGS,The world's great ways unclose
380,SONGS,Through little wooded hills:
381,SONGS,"An air that stirs and stills,"
382,SONGS,Dies sighing where it rose
383,SONGS,Or flies to sigh again
384,SONGS,"In elms, whose stately rows"
385,SONGS,"Receive the summer rain,"
386,SONGS,"And clouds, clouds, clouds go by,"
387,SONGS,"A drifting cavalry,"
388,SONGS,In squadrons that disperse
389,SONGS,And troops that reassemble
390,SONGS,And now they pass and now
391,SONGS,Their glittering wealth disburse
392,SONGS,On tufted grass a-tremble
393,SONGS,And lately leafing bough.
394,SONGS,
395,SONGS,Thus through the shining day
396,SONGS,We'll love or pass away
397,SONGS,"Light hours in golden sleep,"
398,SONGS,With clos'd half-sentient eyes
399,SONGS,"And lids the light comes through,"
400,SONGS,As sheep and flowers do
401,SONGS,"Who no new toils devise,"
402,SONGS,While shining insects creep
403,SONGS,About us where we lie
404,SONGS,"Beneath a pleasant sky,"
405,SONGS,"In fields no trouble fills,"
406,SONGS,"Whence, as the traveller goes,"
407,SONGS,The world's great ways unclose
408,SONGS,Through little wooded hills.
409,SONGS,
410,SONGS,
411,SONGS,
412,SONGS,
413,SONGS,_Walking at Night._
414,SONGS,
415,SONGS,_To A. G._
416,SONGS,
417,SONGS,"The moon poured down on tree and field,"
418,SONGS,"The leaf was silvered on the hedge,"
419,SONGS,"The sleeping kine were half revealed,"
420,SONGS,Half shadowed at the pasture's edge.
421,SONGS,
422,SONGS,"By steep inclines and long descents,"
423,SONGS,"Amid the inattentive trees,"
424,SONGS,"You spoke of the four elements,"
425,SONGS,The four eternal mysteries.
426,SONGS,
427,SONGS,
428,SONGS,
429,SONGS,
430,SONGS,_Half Hope._
431,SONGS,
432,SONGS,"August is gone and now this is September,"
433,SONGS,Softer the sun in a cloudier sky;
434,SONGS,"Yellow the leaves grow and apples grow golden,"
435,SONGS,Blackberries ripen and hedges undress.
436,SONGS,"Watch and you'll see the departure of summer,"
437,SONGS,"Here is the end, this the last month of all:"
438,SONGS,"Pause and look back and remember its promise,"
439,SONGS,All that looked open and easy in May.
440,SONGS,
441,SONGS,"Nothing will stay them, the seasons go onward,"
442,SONGS,"Lightly the bright months fly out of my hand,"
443,SONGS,Softly the leading note calls a new octave;
444,SONGS,Autumn is coming and what have I done?
445,SONGS,"Even as summer my young days go over,"
446,SONGS,No day to pause on and nowhere to rest:
447,SONGS,"Slowly they go but implacably onwards,"
448,SONGS,"Ah! and my dreams, alas, still they are dreams."
449,SONGS,
450,SONGS,"How shall I force all my flowers to fruition,"
451,SONGS,Use up the season of ripening sun?
452,SONGS,"Softly the years go but going have vanished,"
453,SONGS,Soon I shall find myself empty and old.
454,SONGS,"Yet I feel in myself bright buds and blossoms,"
455,SONGS,Promise of mellowest bearing to be.
456,SONGS,Still I have time beside what I have wasted:
457,SONGS,"Life shall be good to me, work shall be sweet."
458,SONGS,
459,SONGS,
460,SONGS,
461,SONGS,
462,SONGS,_A New Song about the Sea._
463,SONGS,
464,SONGS,"From Amberley to Storrington,"
465,SONGS,"From Storrington to Amberley,"
466,SONGS,From Amberley to Washington
467,SONGS,You cannot see or smell the sea.
468,SONGS,But why the devil should you wish
469,SONGS,To see the home of silly fish?
470,SONGS,
471,SONGS,"Since I prefer the earth and air,"
472,SONGS,The fish may wallow in the sea
473,SONGS,"And live the life that they prefer,"
474,SONGS,"If they will leave the land to me,"
475,SONGS,"So wish for each what he may wish,"
476,SONGS,"The earth for me, the sea for fish."

725,PASTORAL PIECES,_The Vision in the Wood._
726,PASTORAL PIECES,
727,PASTORAL PIECES,The husht September afternoon was sweet
728,PASTORAL PIECES,With rich and peaceful light.  I could not hear
729,PASTORAL PIECES,On either side the sound of moving feet
730,PASTORAL PIECES,Although the hidden road was very near.
731,PASTORAL PIECES,"The laden wood had powdered sun in it,"
732,PASTORAL PIECES,"Slipped through the leaves, a quiet messenger"
733,PASTORAL PIECES,To tell me of the golden world outside
734,PASTORAL PIECES,Where fields of stubble stretched through counties wide.
735,PASTORAL PIECES,
736,PASTORAL PIECES,And yet I did not move.  My head reposed
737,PASTORAL PIECES,Upon a tuft of dry and scented grass
738,PASTORAL PIECES,"And, with half-seeing eyes, through eyelids closed,"
739,PASTORAL PIECES,"I watched the languid chain of shadows pass,"
740,PASTORAL PIECES,Light as the slowly moving shade imposed
741,PASTORAL PIECES,"By summer clouds upon a sea of glass,"
742,PASTORAL PIECES,And strove to banish or to make more clear
743,PASTORAL PIECES,The elusive and persistent dream of her.
744,PASTORAL PIECES,
745,PASTORAL PIECES,"And then I saw her, very dim at first,"
746,PASTORAL PIECES,"Peering for nuts amid the twisted boughs,"
747,PASTORAL PIECES,"Thought her some warm-haired dryad, lately burst"
748,PASTORAL PIECES,"Out of the chambers of her leafy house,"
749,PASTORAL PIECES,Seeking for nuts for food and for her thirst
750,PASTORAL PIECES,"Such water as the woodland stream allows,"
751,PASTORAL PIECES,After the greedy summer has drunk up
752,PASTORAL PIECES,All but a drain within the mossy cup.
753,PASTORAL PIECES,
754,PASTORAL PIECES,"Then I, beholding her, was still a space"
755,PASTORAL PIECES,"And marked each posture as she moved or stood,"
756,PASTORAL PIECES,Watching the sunlight on her hair and face.
757,PASTORAL PIECES,Thus with calm folded hands and quiet blood
758,PASTORAL PIECES,I gazed until her counterfeited grace
759,PASTORAL PIECES,"Faded and left me lonely in the wood,"
760,PASTORAL PIECES,"Glad that the gods had given so much as this,"
761,PASTORAL PIECES,"To see her, if I might not have her kiss."

768,PASTORAL PIECES,"This is the valley where we sojourn now,"
769,PASTORAL PIECES,Cut up by narrow brooks and rich and green
770,PASTORAL PIECES,And shaded sweetly by the waving bough
771,PASTORAL PIECES,About the trench where floats the soft serene
772,PASTORAL PIECES,Arun with waters running low and low
773,PASTORAL PIECES,Through banks where lately still the tide has been;
774,PASTORAL PIECES,"Here is our resting-place, you walk with me"
775,PASTORAL PIECES,And watch the light die out in Amberley.
776,PASTORAL PIECES,
777,PASTORAL PIECES,"The light that dies is soft and flooding still,"
778,PASTORAL PIECES,Shed from the broad expanse of all the skies
779,PASTORAL PIECES,"And brimming up the space from hill to hill,"
780,PASTORAL PIECES,"Where yet the sheep in their sweet exercise,"
781,PASTORAL PIECES,"Roaming the meadows, crop and find their fill"
782,PASTORAL PIECES,And to each other speak with moaning cries;
783,PASTORAL PIECES,We on the hill-side standing rest and see
784,PASTORAL PIECES,The light die out in brook and grass and tree.
785,PASTORAL PIECES,
786,PASTORAL PIECES,Lately we walked upon the lonely downs
787,PASTORAL PIECES,And through the still heat of the heavy day
788,PASTORAL PIECES,We heard the medley of low drifting sounds
789,PASTORAL PIECES,And through the matted brambles found a way
790,PASTORAL PIECES,Or lightly trod upon enchanted grounds
791,PASTORAL PIECES,"Musing, or with rich blackberries made delay,"
792,PASTORAL PIECES,"Where feed such fruit on the rich air, until"
793,PASTORAL PIECES,We struck like falling stars from Bignor Hill.
794,PASTORAL PIECES,
795,PASTORAL PIECES,"Down the vast slope, by chalky roads and steep,"
796,PASTORAL PIECES,"With trees and bushes hidden here and there,"
797,PASTORAL PIECES,By circling turns into the valley deep
798,PASTORAL PIECES,We came and left behind the hill-top air
799,PASTORAL PIECES,"For this cool village where to-night we sleep,"
800,PASTORAL PIECES,"A country meal, a country bed to share,"
801,PASTORAL PIECES,With sleepy kisses and contented dreams
802,PASTORAL PIECES,Over a land of still and narrow streams.
803,PASTORAL PIECES,
804,PASTORAL PIECES,"The light is ebbing in the dusky sky,"
805,PASTORAL PIECES,The valley floor is in the shadow.  Hark!
806,PASTORAL PIECES,With rushing and mysterious noises fly
807,PASTORAL PIECES,"The bats already, looking for the dark"
808,PASTORAL PIECES,With blinking still and unaccustomed eye.
809,PASTORAL PIECES,Now over Rackham Mount a steady spark
810,PASTORAL PIECES,"Burns, rising slowly in the rising night,"
811,PASTORAL PIECES,And pledges peace and promises delight.
812,PASTORAL PIECES,
813,PASTORAL PIECES,Now from the east the wheeling shade appears
814,PASTORAL PIECES,"And softly night into the valley falls,"
815,PASTORAL PIECES,"Soft on the meadows drop her dewy tears,"
816,PASTORAL PIECES,Softly a darkness on the crumbled walls.
817,PASTORAL PIECES,"Now in the dusk the village disappears,"
818,PASTORAL PIECES,"Men's songs are hushed there and the children's calls,"
819,PASTORAL PIECES,While night in passage swallows up the land
820,PASTORAL PIECES,And in the shadow your hand seeks my hand.
821,PASTORAL PIECES,
822,PASTORAL PIECES,Only the glimmering stars in heaven lie
823,PASTORAL PIECES,And unseen trees with rustling still betray
824,PASTORAL PIECES,"How all the valley lives invisibly,"
825,PASTORAL PIECES,"Where dim sweet odours, remnants of the day,"
826,PASTORAL PIECES,"Float from the sleeping fields to please and die,"
827,PASTORAL PIECES,"Borne up by roaming airs, that drift away"
828,PASTORAL PIECES,"Beyond our hearing, vagabond and light,"
829,PASTORAL PIECES,To visit the cool meadows of the night.

835,PASTORAL PIECES,
836,PASTORAL PIECES,"Daphne is running, running through the grass,"
837,PASTORAL PIECES,The long stalks whip her ankles as she goes.
838,PASTORAL PIECES,"I saw the nymph, the god, I saw them pass"
839,PASTORAL PIECES,And how a mounting flush of tender rose
840,PASTORAL PIECES,Invaded the white bosom of the lass
841,PASTORAL PIECES,"And reached her shoulders, conquering their snows."
842,PASTORAL PIECES,"He wasted all his breath, imploring still:"
843,PASTORAL PIECES,They passed behind the shadow of the hill.
844,PASTORAL PIECES,
845,PASTORAL PIECES,"The mad course goes across the silent plain,"
846,PASTORAL PIECES,Their flying footsteps make a path of sound
847,PASTORAL PIECES,Through all the sleeping country.  Now with pain
848,PASTORAL PIECES,She runs across a stretch of stony ground
849,PASTORAL PIECES,That wounds her soft-palmed feet and now again
850,PASTORAL PIECES,"She hastens through a wood where flowers abound,"
851,PASTORAL PIECES,Which staunch her cuts with balsam where she treads
852,PASTORAL PIECES,And for her healing give their trodden heads.
853,PASTORAL PIECES,
854,PASTORAL PIECES,"Her sisters, from their coverts unbetrayed,"
855,PASTORAL PIECES,"Look out in fright and see the two go by,"
856,PASTORAL PIECES,"Each unrelenting, and reflect dismayed"
857,PASTORAL PIECES,How fear and anguish glisten in her eye.
858,PASTORAL PIECES,By them unhelped goes on the fleeting maid
859,PASTORAL PIECES,Whose breath is coming short in agony:
860,PASTORAL PIECES,"Hard at her heels pursues the golden boy,"
861,PASTORAL PIECES,"She flies in fear of him, she flies from joy."
862,PASTORAL PIECES,
863,PASTORAL PIECES,"His arrows scattered on the countryside,"
864,PASTORAL PIECES,"His shining bow deserted, he pursues"
865,PASTORAL PIECES,"Through hindering woodlands, over meadows wide"
866,PASTORAL PIECES,And now no longer as he runs he sues
867,PASTORAL PIECES,But breathing deep and set and eager-eyed.
868,PASTORAL PIECES,"His flashing feet disperse the morning dews,"
869,PASTORAL PIECES,"His hands most roughly put the boughs away,"
870,PASTORAL PIECES,That cross and cling and join and make delay.
871,PASTORAL PIECES,
872,PASTORAL PIECES,Across small shining brooks and rills they leap
873,PASTORAL PIECES,And now she fords the waters of a stream;
874,PASTORAL PIECES,Her hot knees plunge into the hollows deep
875,PASTORAL PIECES,"And cool, where ancient trout in quiet dream;"
876,PASTORAL PIECES,"The silver minnows, wakened from their sleep"
877,PASTORAL PIECES,"In sunny shallows, round her ankles gleam;"
878,PASTORAL PIECES,"She scrambles up the grassy bank and on,"
879,PASTORAL PIECES,Though courage and quick breath are nearly done.
880,PASTORAL PIECES,
881,PASTORAL PIECES,"Now in the dusky spinneys round the field,"
882,PASTORAL PIECES,"The fauns set up a joyous mimicry,"
883,PASTORAL PIECES,"Pursuing of light nymphs, who lightly yield,"
884,PASTORAL PIECES,Or startle the young dryad from her tree
885,PASTORAL PIECES,And shout with joy to see her limbs revealed
886,PASTORAL PIECES,And give her grace and bid her swiftly flee:
887,PASTORAL PIECES,"The hunt is up, pursuer and pursued"
888,PASTORAL PIECES,"Run, double, twist, evade, turn, grasp, elude."
889,PASTORAL PIECES,
890,PASTORAL PIECES,"The woodlands are alive with chase and cry,"
891,PASTORAL PIECES,"Escape and triumph.  Still the nymph in vain,"
892,PASTORAL PIECES,With heaving breast in lovely agony
893,PASTORAL PIECES,"And wide and shining eyes that show her pain,"
894,PASTORAL PIECES,Leads on the god and now she knows him nigh
895,PASTORAL PIECES,And sees before her the unsheltered plain.
896,PASTORAL PIECES,His hot hand touches her white side and she
897,PASTORAL PIECES,Thrusts up her hands and turns into a tree.
898,PASTORAL PIECES,
899,PASTORAL PIECES,"There is an end of dance and mocking tune,"
900,PASTORAL PIECES,Of laughter and bright love among the leaves.
901,PASTORAL PIECES,"The sky is overcast, the afternoon"
902,PASTORAL PIECES,Is dull and heavy for a god who grieves.
903,PASTORAL PIECES,The woods are quiet and the oak-tree soon
904,PASTORAL PIECES,The ruffled dryad in her trunk receives.
905,PASTORAL PIECES,Cold grow the sunburnt bodies and the white:
906,PASTORAL PIECES,The nymphs and fauns will lie alone to-night.
