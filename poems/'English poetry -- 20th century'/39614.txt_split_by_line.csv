161,INTRODUCTION,
162,INTRODUCTION,"""We are (often) so impressed by the power of poetry that we think of it"
163,INTRODUCTION,as something made by a wonderful and unusual person: we do not realize
164,INTRODUCTION,"the fact that all the wonder and marvel is in our own brains, that the"
165,INTRODUCTION,poet is ourselves. He speaks our language better than we do merely
166,INTRODUCTION,because he is more skilful with it than we are; his skill is part of our
167,INTRODUCTION,"skill, his power of our power; generations of English-speaking men and"
168,INTRODUCTION,"women have made us sensible to these things, and our sensibility comes"
169,INTRODUCTION,from the same source that the poet's power of stimulating it comes from.
170,INTRODUCTION,"Given a little more sensitiveness to external stimuli, a little more"
171,INTRODUCTION,"power of associating ideas, a co-ordination of the functions of"
172,INTRODUCTION,"expression somewhat more apt, a sense of rhythm somewhat keener than the"
173,INTRODUCTION,"average--given these things we should be poets, too, even as he is...."

177,INTRODUCTION,2. _Of what English poetry consists_:
178,INTRODUCTION,
179,INTRODUCTION,"""English poetry is not a rhythm of sound, but a rhythm of ideas, and the"
180,INTRODUCTION,"flow of attention-stresses (_i.e._, varying qualities of words and"
181,INTRODUCTION,cadence) which determines its beauty is inseparably connected with the
182,INTRODUCTION,"thought; for each of them is a judgment of identity, or a judgment of"
183,INTRODUCTION,"relation, or an expression of relation, and not a thing of mere empty"
184,INTRODUCTION,sound.... He who would think of it as a pleasing arrangement of vocal
185,INTRODUCTION,sounds has missed all chance of ever understanding its meaning. There
186,INTRODUCTION,"awaits him only the barren generalities of a foreign prosody, tedious,"
187,INTRODUCTION,"pedantic, fruitless. And he will flounder ceaselessly amid the scattered"
188,INTRODUCTION,"timbers of its iambuses, spondees, dactyls, tribrachs, never reaching"
189,INTRODUCTION,"the firm ground of truth."""

466,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,
467,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,Softly in the silence the evening rain descends....
468,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"The soft wind lifts the rain-mist, flurries it, and spends"
469,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"Its grief in mournful sighs, drifting from field to field,"
470,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,Soaking the draggled sprays which the low hedges wield
471,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,As they labour in the wet and the load of the wind.
472,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,The last light is dimming; night comes on behind.
473,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,
474,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"I hear no sound but the wind and the rain,"
475,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"And trample of horses, loud and lost again"
476,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,Where the waggons in the mist rumble dimly on
477,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,Bringing more shell.
478,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,The last gleam is gone.
479,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,It is not day or night; only the mists unroll
480,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,And blind with their sorrow the sight of my soul.
481,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,
482,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,I hear the wind weeping in the hollow overhead:
483,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,She goes searching for the forgotten dead
484,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,Hidden in the hedges or trodden into muck
485,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"Under the trenches, or maybe limply stuck"
486,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,Somewhere in the branches of a high lonely tree--
487,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,He was a sniper once. They never found his body.
488,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,
489,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"I see the mist drifting. I hear the wind and rain,"
490,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,And on my clammy face the oozed breath of the slain
491,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,Seems to be blowing. Almost I have heard
492,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,In the shuddering drift the lost dead's last word:
493,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,
494,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"Go home, go home, go to my house;"
495,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"Knock at the door, knock hard, arouse"
496,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,My wife and the children--that you must do--
497,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"What do you say?--Tell the children, too--"
498,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"Knock at the door, knock hard, arouse"
499,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,The living. Say: the dead won't come back to this house.
500,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,O ... but it's cold--I soak in the rain--
501,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,Shrapnel found me--I shan't come home again--
502,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"No, not home again!"
503,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,
504,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,The mourning voices trail
505,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"Away into rain, into darkness ... the pale"
506,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,Soughing of the night drifts on in between.
507,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,
508,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,_The Voices were as if the dead had never been._
509,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,
510,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"O melancholy heavens, O melancholy fields,"
511,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"The glad, full darkness grows complete and shields"
512,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,Me from your appeal.
513,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,With a terrible delight
514,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,I hear far guns low like oxen at the night.
515,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,Flames disrupt the sky.
516,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,The work is begun.
517,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"""Action!"" My guns crash, flame, rock and stun"
518,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,Again and again. Soon the soughing night
519,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,Is loud with their clamour and leaps with their light.
520,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,
521,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,The imperative chorus rises sonorous and fell:
522,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,My heart glows lighted as by fires of hell.
523,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,Sharply I pass the terse orders down.
524,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,The guns blare and rock. The hissing rain is blown
525,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"Athwart the hurtled shell that shrilling, shrilling goes"
526,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"Away into the dark, to burst a cloud of rose"
527,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,Over German trenches.
528,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,A pause: I stand and see
529,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,Lifting into the night like founts incessantly
530,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,The pistol-lights' pale spores upon the glimmering air....
531,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"Under them furrowed trenches empty, pallid, bare...."
532,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,And rain snowing trenchward ghostly and white.
533,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,
534,II.--NIGHT BOMBARDMENT,"O dead in the hedges, sleep ye well to-night!"

542,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,And he could not stay his hand
543,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,From moving to the barbed wire's broken strand.
544,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,A rifle cracked.
545,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,He fell.

547,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,"Whispered itself passing high, high overhead."
548,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,His wound was wet to his hand: for still it bled
549,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,On to the glimmering ground.
550,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,"Then with a slow, vain smile his wound he bound,"
551,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,"Knowing, of course, he'd not see home again--"
552,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,Home whose thought he put away.
553,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,His men
554,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,"Whispered: ""Where's Mister Gates?"" ""Out on the wire."""

556,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,"Dawn blinked, and the fire"
557,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,Of the Germans heaved up and down the line.
558,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,"""Stand to!"""
559,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,"Too late! ""I'll get him."" ""O the swine!"

564,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,"A whisper: ""'A went down at the last flare."""
565,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,Meanwhile the Maxims toc-toc-tocked; their swish
566,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,Of bullets told death lurked against the wish.
567,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,No hope for him!
568,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,"His corporal, as one shamed,"
569,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,Vainly and helplessly his ill-luck blamed.

578,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,And the tears came
579,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,"Scaldingly sweet, more lovely than a flame."
580,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,He closed his eyes: he thought of home

593,III.--COMRADES: AN EPISODE,And he lay still. Blood swam across his sight.

1245,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",Snow-torrent golden in the hot firelight....
1246,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",I see him smiling at the streamered air.
1247,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",
1248,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)","I watched him to the open window go,"
1249,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)","And lean long smiling, whispering to the snow,"
1250,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",Play with his hands amid the fiery flow
1251,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",And when he turned it flamed amid his hair.
1252,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",
1253,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",Without arose a sudden bell's huge clang
1254,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",Until a thousand bells in answer rang
1255,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",And midnight Oxford hummed and reeled and sang
1256,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",Under the whitening fury of the air.
1257,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",
1258,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",His figure standing in the fiery room....
1259,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",Behind him the snow seething through the gloom....
1260,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)","The great bells shaking, thundering out their doom...."
1261,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",Soft Fiery Snow and Night his being were.
1262,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",
1263,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)","Yet he could be simply glad and take his choice,"
1264,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)","Walking spring woods, mimicking each bird voice;"
1265,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",When he was glad we learned how to rejoice:
1266,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)","If the birds sing, 'tis to my spite they dare."
1267,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",
1268,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)","All women loved him, yet his mother won"
1269,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)","His tenderness alone, for Moon and Sun"
1270,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)","And Rain were for him sister, brother, lovèd one,"
1271,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",And in their life he took an equal share.

1273,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)","Strength he had, too; strength of unrusted will"
1274,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)","Buttressed his natural charity, and ill"

1278,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)","Yet he had weakness, for he burned too fast;"
1279,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",And his unrecked-of body at the last
1280,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)","He in impatience on the bayonets cast,"
1281,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",Body whose spirit had outsoared them there.

1283,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)","I had a friend, but, O! he is now dead."
1284,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",Fate would not let me follow where he led.
1285,"(R. P., LOOS, 1915)",In him I had happiness. But he is dead.

1618,I,Of the ravine. For now I will
1619,I,Descend and take again my fill
1620,I,"Of fancy wild and musing joy,"
1621,I,Such as each dawn brings to alloy
1622,I,The long affliction of a spirit
1623,I,"Who a complete world did inherit,"
1624,I,And feels it crumbling.
1625,I,I will down
1626,I,Whither twin bluffs of sheer stone frown
1627,I,Over sunk seas of billowing pine
1628,I,"Terrace on terrace, line on line,"
1629,I,Below whose heads the broad downs slope
1630,I,"Away, away till senses grope"
1631,I,At something rather felt than seen:
1632,I,"The sea,--not wave-tops, but a sheen"
1633,I,Under the dazed and distant sky....
1634,I,Curled on a cliff-top let me lie.
1635,I,"(For yonder, hap, a breeze is blowing,"
1636,I,And the sun's first gleam is showing
1637,I,Under far wreckage: since our height
1638,I,Inherits day while yet their light
1639,I,Quakes gold under the low clouds' rift.)
1640,I,"Down, then! Miraculously swift"
1641,I,These limbs the gods have given me!...
1642,I,"Couched mid the gorse, anon I see,"
1643,I,"Opposing this my bluff, the face"
1644,I,"Of the sheer rock, and 'long it trace"
1645,I,"A sill scarce ample for a goat,"
1646,I,Yet midway in the ledge-path note
1647,I,"A cave's mouth, which thick creepers hide"
1648,I,Fallen in a silvery tide
1649,I,From a slant crevice overhead.
1650,I,"And, lo! the creeper stirs, is shed--"
1651,I,And all falls quiet.
1652,I,Till at last
1653,I,"Issues a voice deep, young and vast:"
1654,I,
1655,I,
1656,II,II
1657,II,
1658,II,"_Centaur._ Up! the ag'd centaurs lie yet sleeping,"
1659,II,While crouch I palled of this cavern lair              THE CENTAUR'S
1660,II,And watch the stretched sea-eagle sweeping             MORNING SONG.
1661,II,Down the grey-blue drizzling air.
1662,II,"The sea-nymphs, too, will now be waking,"
1663,II,If sickle-eyed they have not played
1664,II,"Across the moonlight sets me aching,"
1665,II,"Longing and slinking, half afraid,"
1666,II,"Down the feathery, tawny sand"
1667,II,On sighing tread
1668,II,"Deep into banks of glistering shell,"
1669,II,To halt in dread
1670,II,Lest my hoof-scrunch break the spell
1671,II,Of the syren-chants that swell
1672,II,From the dim shoals toward the land.
1673,II,
1674,II,But this morn the breeze is blowing
1675,II,Freshly: I hear lightly flowing
1676,II,From the bending giant beam
1677,II,Bars the forehead of our door
1678,II,The golden raindrops in a stream
1679,II,Pattering on the steamy floor.
1680,II,
1681,II,_Faun._ It is the Centaur's voice I hear!
1682,II,"Young and lusty, deep and clear:"
1683,II,And the Panisks at his voice
1684,II,"In their fastnesses rejoice,"
1685,II,Emerging from the creviced crag
1686,II,"Or cave beneath the mountain's jag,"
1687,II,"Merry, shaggy, light of hoof,"
1688,II,"To run along the narrow roof,"
1689,II,And upon the shelvèd height
1690,II,Dance before the swimming light.
1691,II,
1692,II,"_Centaur._ And I see upon the ledge,"
1693,II,"Astir over the hanging edge,                           THE CENTAUR'S"
1694,II,A russet briar cold with dew                           MORNING SONG
1695,II,"And beyond, forlornly pent                             (_continued_)"
1696,II,"In a grey cloud's gliding rent,"
1697,II,A pure pool of the brightest blue:
1698,II,So near it seems I've but to cast
1699,II,A flint out on the forward vast
1700,II,To mark it flashing blithely through!
1701,II,
1702,II,And now at last!
1703,II,At last
1704,II,"The great Sun,"
1705,II,"The Sudden One,"
1706,II,Stamps upon the cloudy floor;
1707,II,"The heavens are split, and through the floor"
1708,II,Heaven's golden treasures tumbling pour....
1709,II,"And the Sun himself, divine,"
1710,II,Doth descend
1711,II,In such a bursting blaze of shine
1712,II,That his glorious hair is shook
1713,II,Over the wide world's craggiest end!
1714,II,"And, even I, I dare not look."
1715,II,
1716,II,*       *       *       *       *
1717,II,
1718,II,I will shout! I will ramp!
1719,II,Just three bounds: then out and stamp
1720,II,Where the air like water is
1721,II,Eddying up over the precipice;--
1722,II,"Wind with an edge to it, sea-damp,"
1723,II,Blowing from the canyon's race
1724,II,Where the dripping sea-wind heaves
1725,II,Through a tunnel of the rocks
1726,II,Sea-water up in thunderous sheaves
1727,II,"Against the precipitous water-rapids,"
1728,II,To whip from off th' high-hurtled shocks
1729,II,Bursts of mist which soak the leaves
1730,II,Of each scented bush that cleaves
1731,II,To the cliffs. Till Fauns and Lapiths
1732,II,"Dance in the sun-bewildered brakes,"
1733,II,"Till even flushed Silenus wakes,"
1734,II,And--with a short deep-throated troll
1735,II,"To the wind and to the wine,"
1736,II,"Both delirious, both divine!--"
1737,II,"Starts, as he drains the tilted bowl,"
1738,II,"At din, to rolling uproar grown,"
1739,II,"Of rocks dislodged and bounding down,"
1740,II,"With splinter of pines and flint-shocked flashes,"
1741,II,From the ridge whereon we dance
1742,II,In a loud exuberance
1743,II,Of rattling hoofs whose echoes drown
1744,II,The squealing joy or reedy pining
1745,II,"Of Pan's pipe, where Pan reclining"
1746,II,Plays in the clouded mountain's crown!
1747,II,
1748,II,
1749,III,III
1750,III,
1751,III,_Faun._ It is the Centaur's voice I hear.
1752,III,"The creeper tresses toss with fear,                  _The Faun hails"
1753,III,Then part before a pow'rful hand.                     the Centaur._
1754,III,"See, see, O see the Centaur stand"
1755,III,"With ruggëd head erect and proud,"
1756,III,Whose rounded mouth yet chants aloud
1757,III,The Joy of Mind fulfilled in Force:
1758,III,"Glory of Man, glory of Horse."
1759,III,
1760,III,"Hail thou, the sov'reign of the hill!"
1761,III,"Hail thou, upon whose locks distil"
1762,III,Fresh dews when mid majestic night
1763,III,"Thou pacest, hid, along the height."
1764,III,Thine are the solitudes of snow
1765,III,"Between bare peaks, thy hooves also"
1766,III,Are heard within the dusk defile
1767,III,Where Titans of a sunless while
1768,III,Fashioned huge sphinxes in whose eyes
1769,III,"The Kite now skulks or, girding, cries."
1770,III,"Thine, too, the sole and sinking pine"
1771,III,"Burned by the sunset--ay, and thine"
1772,III,The ledges whence a sudden sift
1773,III,"Of snow sighs downward, thine the swift"
1774,III,Uproar of avalanche and all
1775,III,"The mountain echoes. To thee call,"
1776,III,When the snow melts and there are seen
1777,III,Crocuses blazing mid the green
1778,III,"Of the dewed grass, the Sylvan folk:"
1779,III,The Dryads from the leafless oak
1780,III,"Or budded elder, that at length"
1781,III,Thou mayst release them by the strength
1782,III,Of thy tough fingers; 'tis on thee
1783,III,The nymphs cry should the runnels be
1784,III,"Exhausted of the midsummer sun,"
1785,III,"Sith, stamping, thou canst make to run"
1786,III,The hoarded waters of the wold.
1787,III,And among men thou art of old
1788,III,Thought's emblem: for to thee belong
1789,III,"All gifts of deep, wise, epic song."
1790,III,"Hail, then, whom Earth and mankind hails."
1791,III,"And Ocean, whose high-spouting whales"
1792,III,"And dripping serpents, that arise"
1793,III,Swinging their gold crests to the skies
1794,III,To drink in all thy bold descant
1795,III,"Hail, though they cannot view thee chant,"
1796,III,As I who now behold in sooth
1797,III,Thy lighted eyes and singing mouth.
1798,III,
1799,III,"O grape-hung locks! glorious face,                 _Of the Centaur's"
1800,III,"Capacious frame, sinewy grace                           Beauty._"
1801,III,Of arm that lifts a skully lyre
1802,III,Whose dithyramb whirls ever higher!
1803,III,"Deep breast-bone, belly, curvèd thews--"
1804,III,Such as the tussling oak doth use
1805,III,Upon the crumbled scarp to grip--
1806,III,Striking from trunk down through the hip
1807,III,Into the stallion's massive shoulders
1808,III,Glossy as moonlit ice-bound boulders!
1809,III,"Stiff, stalwart forelegs, heavy hoof"
1810,III,Yet fleeter far on heights aloof
1811,III,Than ev'n such doubled hares as race
1812,III,"Blue 'thwart dim fells, or, speck in space,"
1813,III,"Osprey, gale-swept across the tides!"
1814,III,Thy man's trunk glisters; on thy sides
1815,III,"A soft and silver shagginess,"
1816,III,"Inviting slim hands to caress,"
1817,III,Hangs dewy----
1818,III,
1819,III,"_Centaur._      Faun, Faun, art thou near?"
1820,III,
1821,III,"_Faun._ Behold me stand, proud Centaur, here"
1822,III,Upon the bluff where 'neath me lies
1823,III,The sunned pool of the precipice.
1824,III,
1825,III,"_Centaur._ Faun, in my veins the blood 'gins race,"
1826,III,"The new sun sweats upon my face,                            _Of the"
1827,III,"Dazzles my pupils, golden swims                            Centaur's"
1828,III,Over my flushed and fervid limbs.                           Ardour._
1829,III,I feel in me my spirit rise
1830,III,Griffon-like flogging up tall skies.
1831,III,"Now is the Morning of the World,"
1832,III,And through my heart a flood is hurled
1833,III,"Of onerous joyance, of desire"
1834,III,To clutch the sun and spill its fire
1835,III,Down heaven's blue bulwarks! to snatch life
1836,III,And drain its lusty full in strife
1837,III,Of all my body with the bent
1838,III,Wrestle of every element:
1839,III,"Close with the whirlwind, front the tide"
1840,III,And turn its moony press aside.
1841,III,
1842,III,But in the world I cannot find
1843,III,"A match in strength, a foe in mind...."
1844,III,"At dawn, at eve the waters burn;"
1845,III,All night the constellations turn
1846,III,"Round the dark pole, and none knows why...."
1847,III,None seeks to know save only I
1848,III,"And thou, O Faun. We are alone...."
1849,III,"Yet sometimes, when the wind is gone"
1850,III,"And all below shines sunned and still,"
1851,III,I feel depart from me the will
1852,III,"Merely to know, to know and wait:"
1853,III,I would do more: I would create.
1854,III,Though what I know not; but I would
1855,III,Spend this my mind and hardihood.
1856,III,Yet find no means save physic force:--
1857,III,"Sing as a man, stride as a horse."
1858,III,Then stride I? Swift I overcome
1859,III,The fleetest. Sing I? All are dumb.
1860,III,Natheless my heart demands in grief
1861,III,"Ardour, endurance and relief;"
1862,III,"Asks, but receives not."
1863,III,
1864,III,_Faun._               Shall not I
1865,III,"Echo thy pain, whom Fates deny"
1866,III,"Answer to thought,--as they to thee"
1867,III,The lust-of-action's fill? But we
1868,III,"Accept too much, O Sire. 'Twere best,"
1869,III,"Though idly, to fulfil our zest."
1870,III,
1871,III,Four leagues this canyon runs between                     _Of the
1872,III,Us twain or ever there is seen                           Challenge._
1873,III,The arch of rock whose massy grace
1874,III,Bridges yon gap of golden space.
1875,III,"Deignest thou, then, to race with me"
1876,III,"From such tall eyries to the sea,"
1877,III,If even now I upward leap?
1878,III,
1879,III,_Centaur._ Leap then! I catch thee e'er the steep
1880,III,Subsides in woodland or in down.
1881,III,
1882,III,
1883,IV,IV
1884,IV,
1885,IV,Away! My rapping footfalls drown                       _And of the
1886,IV,All but the sobbing of the wind                         Manner of
1887,IV,Within my ears and loud behind                         the Running._
1888,IV,The thunder of the Centaur's hooves
1889,IV,"Where, like a hailstorm, down he moves."
1890,IV,"Past me the spun pines rock and hiss,"
1891,IV,"Behind my feet stones pelted whizz,"
1892,IV,"Hills rise before me, backward flow,"
1893,IV,"The bare downs, bright'ning, mount below...."
1894,IV,"On. On. Down. Down. But, ah, no more!"
1895,IV,My breath comes keener than the frore
1896,IV,Indraught of age-long mountain frost;
1897,IV,"My head turns dizzy, feet are lost."
1898,IV,Yet scamper feet! A rock--a mound:
1899,IV,Rap! Rap! I soar it at a bound.
1900,IV,"On. On. Down. Down. A sudden brook,"
1901,IV,And now--in mid-air--lo! there look
1902,IV,Laughingly up at me the eyes
1903,IV,"Of Hyads, and their fading cries"
1904,IV,Ring in my ears. Can they have seen
1905,IV,The Centaur hurtle by between
1906,IV,Them and the clouds? The downs up-fly.
1907,IV,Now earth's bowl rocks and reels the sky
1908,IV,And through my chilly flaming tears
1909,IV,"The molten sun swoops, bursts, and veers...."
1910,IV,
1911,IV,"Still rap my hoofs, though but the sound"
1912,IV,Tells me they yet rocket the ground.
1913,IV,The uproar loudens more behind.
1914,IV,"My crook'd legs cross, my eyes go blind."
1915,IV,"I claw the sky: for, O! I can"
1916,IV,Scarce lurch. I feel the sudden fan
1917,IV,Of the great Centaur's galey breath
1918,IV,"Upon my nape, and like chill death"
1919,IV,"His hand descends. But, ah! he laughs"
1920,IV,Even as Bacchus when he quaffs
1921,IV,In jest or taunt a double bowl.
1922,IV,"I, choking, reel, and, tripping, roll                      _The Faun"
1923,IV,Wildly aside. See! as I fall                                 falls._
1924,IV,A rampant shape majestical
1925,IV,"Storms vehement by, and, storming, swings"
1926,IV,"Hand across rushing lyre, which rings"
1927,IV,"To strains, like rolling breakers tossed"
1928,IV,"High o'er an adamantine coast,"
1929,IV,"In praise of elemental Mirth,"
1930,IV,"Strength, Beauty and the Golden Earth!"
1931,IV,
1932,IV,
1933,V,V
1934,V,
1935,V,"Beyond the rocks, below the trees,                         _Of Downs"
1936,V,The great downs lie; nought but the breeze                  beloved
1937,V,Is heard upon them. All day long                            by Pan._
1938,V,The shadows of the great clouds throng
1939,V,Across their sides: a noiseless rout.
1940,V,"Sometimes a peewit, blown about"
1941,V,"By airy surge, cries a lone cry"
1942,V,Ere hurtled down the clarid sky;
1943,V,Sometimes is heard a shepherd's voice
1944,V,"Shouting, and after it the noise"
1945,V,Of many-pattering crowded sheep
1946,V,"Herded within the gay dog's keep,"
1947,V,"Who also, barking, shouts. Save these"
1948,V,Nought breaks the breezy silences
1949,V,"Of the green sun-swept, cloud-swept spaces...."
1950,V,
1951,V,"Such downs Pan loves, and ofttime places"
1952,V,His lonely altars on them.
1953,I,I
1954,I,One of such now behold. A high
1955,I,"Mound bears it, and its nakedness"
1956,I,Of festal fruit and fragrant dress
1957,I,Hints 'tis new-built.
1958,I,"Up, then, and sound"
1959,I,A rally to the sacred ground:
1960,I,
1961,I,"_Faun._ Come ye, merry shepherds all,"
1962,I,Hulli-lulli-li-lo!                           FAUN'S RALLY.
1963,I,Listen to my piping call:
1964,I,Hulli-li-lo!
1965,I,Hasten to Pan's festival;
1966,I,Leave your sheep.
1967,I,Cannot Pan a shrewd watch keep
1968,I,O'er his own?
1969,I,Safe are they as pent in stall;
1970,I,"Safe are they, for Pan has thrown"
1971,I,Fear about them like a wall.
1972,I,
1973,I,"Wherefore, shepherds, hither run."
1974,I,
1975,I,I have set my pipes to lip;
1976,I,Now they cry despondingly
1977,I,As mid shaken locks I dip.
1978,I,Now shrill--as hark!--I lift them high
1979,I,To swirl the tune about the sky!
1980,I,Up and down and round the sky
1981,I,Till want I further force to blow....
1982,I,"Wherefore, shepherds, hither run,"
1983,I,Dance behind me as I skip;
1984,I,"Strike the tóssed támbours in únison,"
1985,I,"Dance, dance and make to dance the sun"
1986,I,To your Hulli-li-lo!
1987,I,
1988,I,"_Shepherds._ Faun, I come. I hear. We hear--"
1989,I,
1990,I,_Faun._ This my Hulli-li-lo:
1991,I,Now afar and now anear.
1992,I,
1993,I,_Shepherds._ Never sped the midnight deer
1994,I,Half so fast
1995,I,'Fore Diana's star-ringed spear
1996,I,As now haste we to appear
1997,I,At thy Hulli-li-lo!
1998,I,
1999,I,"_Faun._ Joy, O shepherds, at the sound:"
2000,I,Hulli-lulli-li-lo!
2001,I,Pan's new altar I have found:
2002,I,Hulli-li-lo!
2003,I,"Cowslips prank its holy mound,"
2004,I,With ivy have I wreathed it round--
2005,I,But not yet
2006,I,Is the altar's dress complete
2007,I,Till with flowers its horns are bound.
2008,I,
2009,I,"_Shepherds._ Faun, we hear, and from the brook"
2010,I,Flags are pulled; and now we hook
2011,I,"Honeysuckle high, low"
2012,I,Down to us with shepherd's crook;
2013,I,"Breathing floss,"
2014,I,"Clematis twines, rushy stook,"
2015,I,"Apple blossom, down is shook"
2016,I,At thy Hulli-li-lo!
2017,I,
2018,I,_Faun._ Wreathe the pedestal anew;
2019,I,Hulli-lulli-li-lo!
2020,I,Scatter violets scattering dew;
2021,I,Hulli-li-lo!
2022,I,Honey that the brown bees brew
2023,I,"Pour, and rosy blossoms strew;"
2024,I,Spill such wine
2025,I,As in dim-bloomed clusters grew
2026,I,On your father's father's vine.
2027,I,Dance you now.
2028,I,I my pipe cease--thus--to blow:
2029,I,Dance you on.
2030,I,"Dance about the sacred mound,"
2031,I,Dance when every sound is gone....
2032,I,"Now the timbrels softly, sprightly"
2033,I,"Beat, and foot it gaily, lightly;"
2034,I,"Tiptoe o'er the secret ground,"
2035,I,Dance the round.
2036,I,
2037,I,"Next, to the sole, trilling flute"
2038,I,And your own subduèd laughter
2039,I,"Flutter all in throngs and mazes,"
2040,I,"Chase in streams of ardent faces,"
2041,I,With bright eyes and oped mouth mute.
2042,I,"Now alone,"
2043,I,"One by one,"
2044,I,"Dance and dream, and dreaming float"
2045,I,"Till the multitude drifts after,"
2046,I,And I wake a quicker note:
2047,I,Clap your hands aloft and cry;
2048,I,Surge in line tumultuously;
2049,I,"Cry, and with a whirl of voices"
2050,I,Fright the pigeons whickering by!
2051,I,Praise the God of field and fold!
2052,I,"Shout until the hills have told,"
2053,I,"By their sudden echoes flying,"
2054,I,"Flying, crying, falling, dying,"
2055,I,"That upon his name we call,"
2056,I,Who beside the river lying
2057,I,Hears us keep his festival.

2060,VI,VI
2061,VI,
2062,VI,"Wearied of solitary hills,                          _The Faun enters"
2063,VI,"On which the wannish sunlight spills,                  the Valley._"
2064,VI,"And which the glooms of high clouds cross,"
2065,VI,Clouds wandering ever at a loss
2066,VI,"About th' immeasurable sky,"
2067,VI,I will descend. And by-and-by
2068,VI,Glimpse beneath the shouldered down
2069,VI,A hamlet reeking golden-brown;
2070,VI,Creep through a willow copse to view
2071,VI,"Under an orchard avenue,"
2072,VI,A lithe girl in a sun-splashed smock
2073,VI,"Calling her perchëd pigeon flock,"
2074,VI,And as they coo and flutter over
2075,VI,Laughing and carolling of her lover.
2076,VI,
2077,VI,"_Girl._ '_Little pigeon, grave and fleet_'--"
2078,VI,"All the golden grain you'd eat,"
2079,VI,Greedy! let the little bird
2080,VI,"Pick some. Sweet, your cooing's heard;"
2081,VI,You shall have this. There! Be bolder:
2082,VI,Light you now upon my shoulder....
2083,VI,Cooroo? Cooroo in my ear?
2084,VI,"Darling, yes, I hear, I hear:"
2085,VI,"From this hand, then, you shall pluck it."
2086,VI,"Foolish love! your wings have struck it,"
2087,VI,Spilt the grain the grass among.
2088,VI,--Flutter! Flutter!--where's my song?
2089,VI,"'_Little pigeon, grave and fleet_'--"
2090,VI,Too late now your wings you beat
2091,VI,By my face: look in the ground;
2092,VI,"There, they say, all gold is found."
2093,VI,
2094,VI,"Little pigeon, grave and fleet,                     THE PIGEON SONG."
2095,VI,"Eye-of-fire, sweet Snowy-wings,"
2096,VI,Think you that you can discover
2097,VI,On what great green down my lover
2098,VI,Lies by his sunny sheep and sings?
2099,VI,
2100,VI,"If you can, O go and greet"
2101,VI,Him from me; say: She is waiting....
2102,VI,"Not for him, O no! but, sweet,"
2103,VI,"Say June's nigh and doves, remating,"
2104,VI,Fill the dancing noontide heat
2105,VI,With melodious debating.
2106,VI,
2107,VI,Say the swift swoops from the beam;
2108,VI,Soon the cuckoo must cease calling;
2109,VI,"Kingcups flare beside the stream,"
2110,VI,That not glides now but runs brawling;
2111,VI,That wet roses are asteam
2112,VI,In the sun and will be falling.
2113,VI,
2114,VI,Say the chestnut sheds his bloom;
2115,VI,Honey from straw hivings oozes;
2116,VI,There's a nightjar in the coombe;
2117,VI,"Venus nightly burns, and chooses"
2118,VI,Most to blaze above my room;
2119,VI,That the laggard 'tis that loses.
2120,VI,
2121,VI,"Say the nights are warm and free,"
2122,VI,And the great stars swarm above him;
2123,VI,But soon starless night must be.
2124,VI,"Yet if all these do not move him,"
2125,VI,"Tell, O tell--but not too plainly!--"
2126,VI,That I long for him and love him.
2127,VI,
2128,VI,"Little pigeon, grave and fleet,"
2129,VI,"Fly you swiftly, tell him this;"
2130,VI,And I'll give you grain so golden
2131,VI,Midas' self has ne'er beholden
2132,VI,"Aught so gold, and--yes!--a kiss."
2133,VI,
2134,VI,"Smiling at her eager voice,"
2135,VI,"I will grant the girl her choice,"
2136,VI,"Whispering to the pigeon: ""Lo!"
2137,VI,Yon's the way for you to go:
2138,VI,"Over the willows, past the copse,"
2139,VI,To where a sylph-like lime-tree tops
2140,VI,A lonely knoll; then on and on
2141,VI,Toward where yesternight there shone
2142,VI,"A silver comet, scarce descried,"
2143,VI,"Against the fainting eventide."""
2144,VI,
2145,VI,
2146,VII,VII
2147,VII,
2148,VII,"Away then! crashing through the wood,                 _Of the Faun's"
2149,VII,"Prancing in a whimsey mood,                              Whimseys._"
2150,VII,To yowl as a she-wolf does at dark
2151,VII,Until th' infuriate watch-dogs bark;
2152,VII,"Or bid hushed tales of ghosts go round,"
2153,VII,"Of warnings heard, but nothing found,"
2154,VII,By whistling at the village boor;
2155,VII,Or poke my rogue face round a door
2156,VII,"And scare a huffy wife to fits,"
2157,VII,"Who swears, ""'Tis Pan himself!"" or, ""It's"
2158,VII,That grizzled sailor-man who slew
2159,VII,"His mate 'twixt Bogs and Dead Man's Yew!"""
2160,VII,Next through the dairy steal to slake
2161,VII,"My thirst with cream, with honeycake"
2162,VII,Cram my sweet maw; slip in the churn
2163,VII,"A farm cat, that the tub may turn"
2164,VII,And fright maid Molly. I will seek
2165,VII,"Strawberries and stain chin, mouth and cheek"
2166,VII,With nuzzling in their scarlet bowl;
2167,VII,Then in the goodman's bed I'll roll
2168,VII,Because he loves me not; I'll sing
2169,VII,Until the crowded rafters ring
2170,VII,The while about my ears I hang
2171,VII,Bobbed cherries.... Lastly I will clang
2172,VII,"Among the clattering pots and pans,"
2173,VII,"Shout, cry ""Oh help!"" snatch up a man's"
2174,VII,"Cloak, and slip out."
2175,VII,Whoop! Whoop! They run:         _The Pursuit._
2176,VII,"The hare once spied, the hunt's begun!--"
2177,VII,"Goodman and goodman's wife, pert Polly,"
2178,VII,"Clown Colin, Wiggen and maid Molly,"
2179,VII,"Pant, crying, ""Thief!"" The while behind"
2180,VII,"Shrunk Dorcas hops, and fills the wind"
2181,VII,"With apish merriment, shrill malice,"
2182,VII,"And cries of--""Well run, Poll! Run, Alice!"
2183,VII,"Run, child! The master's cloak and all!"
2184,VII,How sad the goodman's ta'en a fall!
2185,VII,"Mistress down, too--he! he! what pity!"
2186,VII,"Run, Alice child, my bird, my pretty;"
2187,VII,"Show 'em how nimble thou canst be,--"
2188,VII,"Ay, but the girl runs prettily."
2189,VII,"Run, Hobbinol, thou gawky man!"
2190,VII,Thou mayest kiss if catch thou can!
2191,VII,Odd's me! and what's it all about?
2192,VII,"A thief? That mischief Faun!"""
2193,VII,A shout
2194,VII,Startles the pigeons from the croft:
2195,VII,"""We've circled him!"" ""He's in the loft."""
2196,VII,"But as they, silent, crowd unto 't"
2197,VII,I jump. For am not I a goat?
2198,VII,From out the hayloft's height I leap
2199,VII,O'er their craned heads into the deep
2200,VII,Grass of the orchard. Thence I run
2201,VII,Across lush meadows. One by one
2202,VII,They fall behind....
2203,VII,A scarecrow I
2204,VII,"Now seek, and 'bout it carefully"
2205,VII,Enwrap the newly pilfered cloak....
2206,VII,Scarecrows are such poor crazy folk....
2207,VII,

2214,VIII,"And, peering forth, behold it tumble"
2215,VIII,Cumbrously into a pool whose white
2216,VIII,Tumult sears the giddied sight.
2217,VIII,"There, half dozed, silent, smile to hear"
2218,VIII,"A babble of voices drawing near,"
2219,VIII,Spy many a boy and laughing lass
2220,VIII,Racing hands-linked across the grass.
2221,VIII,
2222,VIII,_Boys and Girls._ Now has the blue-eyed Spring
2223,VIII,Sped dancing through the plain.                           A CATCH
2224,VIII,Girls weave a daisy chain;                               FOR SPRING.
2225,VIII,Boys race beside the sedge;
2226,VIII,Dust fills the blinding lane;
2227,VIII,May lies upon the hedge:
2228,VIII,All creatures love the spring!
2229,VIII,
2230,VIII,"The clouds laugh on, and would"
2231,VIII,Dance with us if they could;
2232,VIII,The larks ascend and shrill;
2233,VIII,A woodpecker fills the wood;
2234,VIII,Jays laugh crossing the hill:
2235,VIII,All creatures love the spring!
2236,VIII,
2237,VIII,The lithe cloud-shadows chase
2238,VIII,"Over the whole earth's face,"
2239,VIII,And where winds ruffling veer
2240,VIII,O'er wooded streams' dark ways
2241,VIII,Mad fish upscudding steer:
2242,VIII,All creatures love the spring!
2243,VIII,
2244,VIII,Into the dairy cool
2245,VIII,"Run, girls, to drink thick cream!"
2246,VIII,"Race, boys, to where the stream"
2247,VIII,"Winds through a rumbling pool,"
2248,VIII,And your bright bodies fling
2249,VIII,Into the foaming cool!
2250,VIII,For we'll enjoy our spring!

2253,IX,IX
2254,IX,
2255,IX,"Seaward my forest way I'll take,                  _Of the Faun's"
2256,IX,And at a pool's lit quietude slake              Journey to the Sea._
2257,IX,"My thirst, and feel a dull flame creep"
2258,IX,Like the first flux of tidal sleep
2259,IX,"Through all my limbs. Yet, when I sink"
2260,IX,"Sleepward, start wide-eyed up to drink"
2261,IX,"The sunned wood's wet deliciousness,"
2262,IX,"Touch flowers, and feel the sun's caress"
2263,IX,"About my locks, and wander on,"
2264,IX,"Or pause to smile up at the sun,"
2265,IX,"Guarding my eyes with glowing hand,"
2266,IX,"Or, leaned against a beech-trunk, stand"
2267,IX,"Watching between the branches' rift,"
2268,IX,As they gently wave and lift
2269,IX,"To the bland breeze softly blowing,"
2270,IX,The noiseless clouds serenely going
2271,IX,"Slowly to the hid, low sea"
2272,IX,I can hear breathing slumberously.
2273,IX,"Till from the woodland I emerge,"
2274,IX,"Greeted by a louder surge,"
2275,IX,And from the bushy cliff-top spy
2276,IX,How the hollow bay doth lie
2277,IX,"One quiver and murmur under the sun,"
2278,IX,And how the lightsome wind-puffs run
2279,IX,"Chasing each other crookedly,"
2280,IX,Over the idly heaving sea.
2281,IX,
2282,IX,"Next I will turn my eyes, perhaps,                        _Of the"
2283,IX,To where the languid waters lapse                       Sea-Horses._
2284,IX,Glittering over a sunburned rock
2285,IX,Round which the shrieking white gulls flock....
2286,IX,"Thus browsing in my solitude,"
2287,IX,I may remember I've a feud
2288,IX,"With the Sea-Horses, once who drave"
2289,IX,Me from the sea-light of their cave.
2290,IX,"Enough! and, crashing down, I come"
2291,IX,To find them drowsing in their home....
2292,IX,So creep I with a crooked stick
2293,IX,To where a blinding pool is quick
2294,IX,With green electric water-snakes.
2295,IX,Sprawling across a rock which bakes
2296,IX,I stir the molten till they boil
2297,IX,And up my hawthorn kick and coil;
2298,IX,"Then scamper, rocketing, to the cave,"
2299,IX,"Hurl the stick in. Hark! how they rave,"
2300,IX,"And plunge up clattering, kicking, neighing,"
2301,IX,"Till Triton on his horn 'gins braying,"
2302,IX,And each hasteneth to belabour
2303,IX,"With hooves or tear with teeth his neighbour,"
2304,IX,And from the cavern's blueness rush
2305,IX,"Into the simmering beach's hush,"
2306,IX,"To stand, with heaving flanks, agaze"
2307,IX,At the hot stones and still sea's blaze:
2308,IX,"Then stampede, scattering high and wide"
2309,IX,A hail of stones and glittering tide.
2310,IX,
2311,IX,
2312,X,X

2317,X,"Hung in the great boughs of the trees,"
2318,X,And the pattern the branchwork weaves
2319,X,"Under the panoply of leaves,"
2320,X,And how high up two butterflies
2321,X,"Pass, vaulting, out into the skies."
2322,X,"Or, entering a silent glade,"
2323,X,Draw a sharp breath and stand dismayed
2324,X,At beauty which doth straight present
2325,X,Such a spasm of ravishment
2326,X,"Sight is confused, and doth confess"
2327,X,Her wreck in voiceless tenderness:
2328,X,Seeing the flower-decked cherry-trees--
2329,X,"Unruffled ever by any breeze,"
2330,X,Unburned by bright dawn's fiery chill--
2331,X,Standing celestially still....
2332,X,
2333,X,"Or lay me down 'neath chestnut boughs,"
2334,X,"And drowse and dream and dream and drowse,"
2335,X,"Drunk with the greenness overhead,"
2336,X,"Until a blossom of sharp red,"
2337,X,"Shook from her high and scalding place,"
2338,X,Splash with chill scent my upturned face.

2345,XI,What sage is he who slowly leads
2346,XI,Disciples on and little heeds
2347,XI,"The holiness of sylvan haunt,"
2348,XI,Where even the silver bird dare chant
2349,XI,But seldom? where the sunlight lies
2350,XI,"Here scalding gold, and yonder dies"
2351,XI,"Into a humid, still, green gloom?"
2352,XI,Hath not he in the forum room
2353,XI,"To vent himself, that now with rude"
2354,XI,Rabble he scareth Solitude
2355,XI,From her ultimate hiding-place?
2356,XI,"Now steps he forward a slow pace,"
2357,XI,"And 'gins his discourse. Hear him prate,"
2358,XI,"O woods, to silence consecrate;"
2359,XI,"Hear him, O flowers, whose golden eyes"
2360,XI,Speak more than all Man's orat'ries!--

2363,XI,Cower at a comet's loveliness                              _And his
2364,XI,Shaken across the midnight sky;                            Oration._
2365,XI,"Though the wind roars, and Victory,"
2366,XI,"A virgin fierce, on vans of gold"
2367,XI,Stoops through the cloud's white smother rolled
2368,XI,Over the armies' shock and flow
2369,XI,"Across the broad green hills below,"
2370,XI,Yet hovers and will not circle down
2371,XI,To cast t'ward one the leafy crown;
2372,XI,Though men drive galleys' golden beaks
2373,XI,"To isles beyond the sunset peaks,"
2374,XI,And cities on the sea behold
2375,XI,"Whose walls are glass, whose gates are gold,"
2376,XI,"Whose turrets, risen in an hour,"
2377,XI,"Dazzle between the sun and shower,"
2378,XI,Whose sole inhabitants are kings
2379,XI,Six cubits high with gryphon's wings
2380,XI,And beard and mien more glorious
2381,XI,Than Midas or Assaracus;
2382,XI,Though priests in many a hill-top fane
2383,XI,Lift anguished hands--and lift in vain--
2384,XI,Toward the sun's shaft dancing through
2385,XI,The bright roof's square of wind-swept blue;
2386,XI,Though 'cross the stars nightly arise
2387,XI,The silver fumes of sacrifice;
2388,XI,"Though a new Helen bring new scars,"
2389,XI,"Pyres piled upon wrecked golden cars,"
2390,XI,"Stacked spears, rolled smoke, and spirits sped"
2391,XI,Like a streaked flame toward the dead:
2392,XI,"Though all these be, yet grows not old"
2393,XI,"Delight of sunned and windy wold,"
2394,XI,"Of soaking downs aglare, asteam,"
2395,XI,Of still tarns where the yellow gleam
2396,XI,"Of a far sunrise slowly breaks,"
2397,XI,Or sunset strews with golden flakes
2398,XI,The deeps which soon the stars will throng.
2399,XI,
2400,XI,For earth yet keeps her undersong
2401,XI,"Of comfort and of ultimate peace,"
2402,XI,That whoso seeks shall never cease
2403,XI,To hear at dawn or noon or night.
2404,XI,"Joys hath she, too, joys thin and bright,"
2405,XI,"Too thin, too bright, for those to hear"
2406,XI,"Who listen with an eager ear,"
2407,XI,"Or course about and seek to spy,"
2408,XI,"Within an hour, eternity."
2409,XI,First must the spirit cast aside
2410,XI,This world's and next his own poor pride
2411,XI,And learn the universe to scan
2412,XI,More as a flower less as a man.
2413,XI,Then shall he hear the lonely dead
2414,XI,"Sing and the stars sing overhead,"
2415,XI,And every spray upon the heath
2416,XI,And larks above and ants beneath;
2417,XI,The stream shall take him in her arms;
2418,XI,Blue skies shall rest him in their calms;
2419,XI,"The wind shall be a lovely friend,"
2420,XI,And every leaf and bough shall bend
2421,XI,Over him with a lover's grace.
2422,XI,The hills shall bare a perfect face
2423,XI,Full of a high solemnity;
2424,XI,"The heavenly clouds shall weep, and be"
2425,XI,Content as overhead they swim
2426,XI,To be high brothers unto him.
2427,XI,No more shall he feel pitched and hurled
2428,XI,Uncomprehended into this world
2429,XI,"For every place shall be his place,"
2430,XI,And he shall recognize its face.
2431,XI,At dawn he shall upon his path;
2432,XI,"No sword shall touch him, nor the wrath"
2433,XI,Of the ranked crowd of clamorous men.
2434,XI,"At even he shall home again,"
2435,XI,"And lay him down to sleep at ease,"
2436,XI,One with the Night and the Night's peace.
2437,XI,"Ev'n Sorrow, to be escaped of none,"
2438,XI,But a more deep communion
2439,XI,"Shall be to him, and Death at last"
2440,XI,"No more dreaded than the Past,"
2441,XI,Whose shadow in the brain of earth
2442,XI,Informs him now and gave him birth.

2452,XI,Over the wide moor's tossing waste?
2453,XI,"Or, stripped to plunge, did never eye"
2454,XI,"The sunned pool smiling treacherously,"
2455,XI,Despair and terror in his heart?
2456,XI,Hate on him!)
2457,XI,See: he draws apart
2458,XI,That with himself he may commune
2459,XI,The while to a low murmuring tune
2460,XI,Wrung from a golden-stringëd lyre
2461,XI,The young men chant. Hist! Draws he nigher?

2467,XI,"The full gaze of her lord the sun,"
2468,XI,And through whose thorns the sunbeams run
2469,XI,Spangling the cavern of the brake
2470,XI,With chequered shade such as the snake
2471,XI,"Loves to repose in, that the heat"
2472,XI,"Upon his sullen coils may beat,"
2473,XI,Breeding within his ancient heart
2474,XI,Such malice that his tongue must dart
2475,XI,"Flickering in silence out and in,"
2476,XI,"The while adown his withered skin,"
2477,XI,"From horns above his murderous eyes,"
2478,XI,"The cold surge shudders, ebbs, and dies."
2479,XI,
2480,XI,"And now yon comes, with solemn head               _And of the Trick"
2481,XI,"Sunk upon breast, with laurel spread               the Faun played,"
2482,XI,About his thought-bewrinkled brows.              thereby symbolizing
2483,XI,"All hail, philosopher! I rouse                     the Rule of Pan"
2484,XI,Thee by a low and single hiss.                       in Nature._
2485,XI,He is frozen still. A sudden bliss
2486,XI,"Seizes me, and a branch I shake"
2487,XI,As gently as an unseen snake
2488,XI,Swinging toward him.
2489,XI,"But he stands,"
2490,XI,Clasps and unclasps his gradual hands
2491,XI,In silence save for one long sigh
2492,XI,Of terror.
2493,XI,And I draw more nigh.
2494,XI,Beneath his glazèd eyes I sway
2495,XI,Three leaves upon one stilly spray:
2496,XI,He blenches.
2497,XI,"Ha! it was well done,"
2498,XI,That final hiss.
2499,XI,I am alone:
2500,XI,For with a harsh cry he has fled
2501,XI,"Hideously stumbling, and is led"
2502,XI,Speechless away.
2503,XI,"The lyre, forgot,"
2504,XI,Lies in the grass....
2505,XI,
2506,XI,
2507,XII,XII
2508,XII,
2509,XII,"I know a spot                _Of the Spring,"
2510,XII,"Where, to the sound of water sighing,                 Frequent Haunt"
2511,XII,"The Naiads, when the sun is lying                     of the Lonely"
2512,XII,"Heavy on mead and fronded tree,                          Naiads._"
2513,XII,When birds are silent and the bee
2514,XII,"Swoons in the dewed heart of the rose,"
2515,XII,Sing hushedly.
2516,XII,I will repose
2517,XII,Upon its banks and to the spring
2518,XII,An answer make with hands that cling
2519,XII,Over this lost lyre's murmurous chords
2520,XII,And with their voiced quiet mingle words
2521,XII,Such as my shrouded soul affords
2522,XII,When the warm blood within my veins
2523,XII,"Throbs heavily, and the noon sun reigns,"
2524,XII,Who would heaven and earth unite
2525,XII,"In one blaze of arduous light,"
2526,XII,"Till dark woods, fields, bronzed sky, and deep,"
2527,XII,In one maniac dull dream sleep.
2528,XII,
2529,XII,
2530,XIII,XIII
2531,XIII,
2532,XIII,"_The Naiads._ Come, ye sorrowful, and steep"
2533,XIII,Your tired brows in a nectarous sleep:                   THE NAIADS'
2534,XIII,For our kisses lightlier run                                MUSIC.
2535,XIII,Than the traceries of the sun
2536,XIII,By the lolling water cast
2537,XIII,"Up grey precipices vast,"
2538,XIII,Lifting smooth and warm and steep
2539,XIII,Out of the palely shimmering deep.
2540,XIII,
2541,XIII,"Come, ye sorrowful, and take"
2542,XIII,Kisses that are but half awake:
2543,XIII,For here are eyes O softer far
2544,XIII,Than the blossom of the star
2545,XIII,"Upon the mothy twilit waters,"
2546,XIII,And here are mouths whose gentle laughters
2547,XIII,Are but the echoes of the deep
2548,XIII,Laughing and murmuring in its sleep.
2549,XIII,
2550,XIII,"Come, ye sorrowful, and see"
2551,XIII,The raindrops flaming goldenly
2552,XIII,On the stream's eddies overhead
2553,XIII,And dragonflies with drops of red
2554,XIII,In the crisp surface of each wing
2555,XIII,"Threading slant rains that flash and sing,"
2556,XIII,"Or under the water-lily's cup,"
2557,XIII,"From darkling depths, roll slowly up"
2558,XIII,The bronze flanks of an ancient bream
2559,XIII,"Into the hot sun's shattered beam,"
2560,XIII,Or over a sunk tree's bubbled bole
2561,XIII,The perch stream in a golden shoal:
2562,XIII,"Come, ye sorrowful; our deep"
2563,XIII,Holds dreams lovelier than sleep.
2564,XIII,
2565,XIII,But if ye sons of Sorrow come
2566,XIII,Only wishing to be numb:
2567,XIII,"Our eyes are sad as bluebell posies,"
2568,XIII,"Our breasts are soft as silken roses,"
2569,XIII,And our hands are tenderer
2570,XIII,Than the breaths that scarce can stir
2571,XIII,The sunlit eglantine that is
2572,XIII,Murmurous with hidden bees.
2573,XIII,"Come, ye sorrowful, and steep"
2574,XIII,Your tired brows in a nectarous sleep.
2575,XIII,
2576,XIII,"Come, ye sorrowful, for here"
2577,XIII,No voices sound but fond and clear
2578,XIII,Of mouths as lorn as is the rose
2579,XIII,"That under water doth disclose,"
2580,XIII,"Amid her crimson petals torn,"
2581,XIII,A heart as golden as the morn;
2582,XIII,And here are tresses languorous
2583,XIII,"As the weeds wander over us,"
2584,XIII,And brows as holy and as bland
2585,XIII,As the honey-coloured sand
2586,XIII,Lying sun-entranced below
2587,XIII,The lazy water's limpid flow:
2588,XIII,"Come, ye sorrowful, and steep"
2589,XIII,Your tired brows in a nectarous sleep.
2590,XIII,
2591,XIII,Sweet water-voices! now must I                            _The Faun
2592,XIII,Unto your sorrowings reply.                                prepares
2593,XIII,But hark! or ever there can sound                         to reply._
2594,XIII,On the lull air the first profound
2595,XIII,"Few murmurs of my lyre's grave strings,"
2596,XIII,A voice uprises. Who now sings
2597,XIII,The noon's and his own tristfulness?
2598,XIII,"A slim youth--in a shepherd's dress,"
2599,XIII,Yet without sheep--who careless lies
2600,XIII,Upon the hill. His shepherd guise
2601,XIII,"Tokens, perhaps, a poet's heart"
2602,XIII,Which joys in wandering apart
2603,XIII,"From the dinned ways where chariots roll,"
2604,XIII,From the shrill sophist with his shoal
2605,XIII,"Of gapers, from the angry mart,"
2606,XIII,From the full eyes and empty heart
2607,XIII,"Of babbling women, from the neat"
2608,XIII,"Aridity of paven street,"
2609,XIII,"A heart that wandering, musing, sings"
2610,XIII,"The joy, depth, pain of simple things:"
2611,XIII,
2612,XIII,_The Youth._ The earth is still; only the white sun climbs
2613,XIII,"Through the green silence of the branching limes,          MIDDAY IN"
2614,XIII,Whose linked flowers hanging from the still tree-top        ARCADIA.
2615,XIII,"Distil their soundless syrup drop by drop,"
2616,XIII,While 'twixt the starry bracket of their lips
2617,XIII,The black bee drowsing floats and drowsing sips.
2618,XIII,The flimsy leaves hang on the bright blue air
2619,XIII,Calm-suspended. Deep peace is everywhere
2620,XIII,Filled with the murmurous rumour of high noon.
2621,XIII,Earth seems with open eyes to sink and swoon.
2622,XIII,In the sky peace: where nothing moves
2623,XIII,Save the sun that smiles and loves.
2624,XIII,A quivering peace is on the grass.
2625,XIII,"Through the noon gloam butterflies pass,"
2626,XIII,"White and hot blue, only to where"
2627,XIII,They can float flat and dream on the soft air....
2628,XIII,"The trees are asleep, beautiful, slumbrous trees!"
2629,XIII,"Stirred only by the passion of the breeze,"
2630,XIII,"That, like a warm wave welling over rocks,"
2631,XIII,Loosens and lifts the mass of drowsing locks.
2632,XIII,"Earth, too, under the profound grass"
2633,XIII,"Sleeps and sleeps, and softly heaves her slumbrous mass."
2634,XIII,The earth sleeps. Sleeps the newly-buried clay
2635,XIII,Or doth divinity trouble it to live alway?
2636,XIII,
2637,XIII,No voice uplifts from under the rapt crust.
2638,XIII,The dust cries to the unregarding dust.
2639,XIII,
2640,XIII,Over the hill the stopped notes of twin reeds
2641,XIII,Speak like drops from an old wound that bleeds:
2642,XIII,A yokel's pipe an ancient pastoral sings
2643,XIII,Above the innumerable murmur of hid wings.
2644,XIII,"I hear the cadence, sorrowful and sweet,"
2645,XIII,The oldest burthen of the earth repeat:
2646,XIII,"All love, all passion, all strife, all delight"
2647,XIII,Are but the dreams that haunt earth's visioned night.
2648,XIII,In her eternal consciousness the stir
2649,XIII,Of Alexander is no more to her
2650,XIII,"Than you or I: being all part of dreams,"
2651,XIII,"The shadowiest shadow of a thing that seems,"
2652,XIII,"The images the lone pipe-player sees,"
2653,XIII,"Sitting and playing to the lone, noon breeze."
2654,XIII,"One note, one life!"
2655,XIII,They sleep: soon we as these!
2656,XIII,
2657,XIII,
2658,XIV,XIV
2659,XIV,
2660,XIV,"Now plunge I into deepest woods,"
2661,XIV,Where everlastingly there broods
2662,XIV,Such quiet and glamour as must be
2663,XIV,Beneath the threshing upper sea.
2664,XIV,"Here burns no sun, but tawny light"
2665,XIV,Pervades the vistas still and bright
2666,XIV,Of mazy boles and fallen leaves....
2667,XIV,I press yet on. At length there cleaves
2668,XIV,The twilit hush a pillared gleam.
2669,XIV,The leafed floor rises. 'Tis a beam
2670,XIV,Of sunlight fallen in a dell
2671,XIV,"Beyond the mound. There will I dwell,"
2672,XIV,Soothed by sunned quietude. For there
2673,XIV,A carved rock spouts and moists the air
2674,XIV,With gross-mouthed pour and rising spray....
2675,XIV,But hark! what festive cries are they                   _Of the
2676,XIV,Which greet me as I top the mound?                   Satyrs' Feast._
2677,XIV,"Below, dispersed and sunk around"
2678,XIV,"The green and golden of the glen,"
2679,XIV,"Lie satyrs; in a leafy den,"
2680,XIV,"Silenus, crowned with vines and roses,"
2681,XIV,"Drowses and starts, blinks, drinks, and dozes."
2682,XIV,"Banqueting dishes strew the grass,"
2683,XIV,"Goblets of gold and peacock glass,"
2684,XIV,"Flagons, urns, many a brimming bowl,"
2685,XIV,And horns from which the flushed fruits roll.
2686,XIV,High o'er the feast a fronded ash
2687,XIV,"Hangs full of sunlight, and the splash"
2688,XIV,Of the spring's leap or gurgeing flow
2689,XIV,"Into the rippled pool below,"
2690,XIV,"Where lilies rock, shakes up a bright"
2691,XIV,Eddy of golden tremulous light
2692,XIV,"Over the leaves. The Oread,"
2693,XIV,"In a hooded lynx pelt clad,"
2694,XIV,Smiles where she lolls ... the while twin fauns
2695,XIV,With stamping hooves and butting horns
2696,XIV,Join combat for a dripping cup
2697,XIV,She bears.
2698,XIV,But now a shout goes up
2699,XIV,At sight of me:
2700,XIV,
2701,XIV,"_Satyr._        ""We feast, we feast;"
2702,XIV,"For, lo! the flaming sun hath ceased               _The Invitation._"
2703,XIV,"To climb the curve of arid sky,"
2704,XIV,"And his meridian holds on high,"
2705,XIV,Narrowing with his scorching beams
2706,XIV,"The chestnut's shade, exhausting streams,"
2707,XIV,"Stilling the woodland singer's note,"
2708,XIV,"Piercing the eyes, shrinking the throat,"
2709,XIV,Saddening the heart of man and beast.
2710,XIV,Yet grieve not we but sprawl and feast.
2711,XIV,"Leap down, O Faun, then, from thy rocks,"
2712,XIV,Leap down to us. Bedew thy locks
2713,XIV,With such cool spicy nards as dwell
2714,XIV,Within this ribbed and rosy shell;
2715,XIV,Around thy scalded temples twine
2716,XIV,"Sprays of this fountain-wetted vine,"
2717,XIV,And from this golden jorum sip
2718,XIV,"Nectarous liquor--ay, and lip"
2719,XIV,"Smooth nectarines, thy sunk teeth clench"
2720,XIV,"In melon dripping sherds, and quench"
2721,XIV,Thy salty thirst anew in flow
2722,XIV,Of sparkled or dark wines that glow
2723,XIV,"With sober warmth and merriment,"
2724,XIV,Until our gladdened voices blent
2725,XIV,"Awake the vigour of our feet,"
2726,XIV,And up we start the grass to beat
2727,XIV,"With fervent foot, drink, dance again,"
2728,XIV,"And, ever at the loud refrain"
2729,XIV,"Clashing our cups, dance on and on,"
2730,XIV,"Till the noontide lull is gone."""
2731,XIV,
2732,XIV,"So join I them, and drink and sup,"
2733,XIV,And fill again the great bowl up;
2734,XIV,"And, drenched thus down, spin lusty tales"
2735,XIV,Of topping bouts 'twixt men and whales;
2736,XIV,Of the East's Emperor who hath
2737,XIV,A pool of wine to be his bath;
2738,XIV,"Of Hercules his thirst, and how"
2739,XIV,"He did all Ethiopia plough,"
2740,XIV,"And plant with vines, his thirst to sate."
2741,XIV,"We will discuss the Ideal State,"
2742,XIV,"Whose sky is covered by a vine,"
2743,XIV,"Whose hills are cheese, whose rivers wine,"
2744,XIV,"Whose trees bear loaves brown, crisp and sweet,"
2745,XIV,"Whose citizens do nought but eat,"
2746,XIV,"But eat and drink, drink, eat, and snore,"
2747,XIV,"And eat again, and wish no more"
2748,XIV,"Than so to drink, snore, eat; who find"
2749,XIV,In this true liberty of mind
2750,XIV,"And true equality, in this"
2751,XIV,"Fraternity, law, earthly bliss."
2752,XIV,"So swill again and yet again,"
2753,XIV,Till a fire flushes all the brain
2754,XIV,"And, trolling lustily and long,"
2755,XIV,Each hearty throat bursts into song.
2756,XIV,
2757,XIV,"_Faun and Satyrs._ Avaunt, mild-eyed Melancholy!"
2758,XIV,"Welcome, Mirth and mænad Folly!                         A DITHYRAMB"
2759,XIV,"See about the lifted bowl,                              TO DIONYSOS."
2760,XIV,"Wrinkled on its bossy scroll,"
2761,XIV,Ribald nymphs and satyrs jolly
2762,XIV,Tussle with a prancing goat;
2763,XIV,"While Silenus, kneeling, drolly"
2764,XIV,Proffers a dry bowl unto 't----
2765,XIV,"Ay, and round the mazer's brim"
2766,XIV,"Boisterous Mermen shouting swim,"
2767,XIV,"And each burly arm lifts up,"
2768,XIV,Wine that o'erbrims its conchëd cup;
2769,XIV,Wherefore pour a triple potion:
2770,XIV,"If such can be dry in ocean,"
2771,XIV,'Tis as Titans we must sup!
2772,XIV,
2773,XIV,"Avaunt, brow and visage pious:"
2774,XIV,None but Bacchus boys come nigh us!
2775,XIV,Raise the bowl and shout his name:
2776,XIV,"Io, Bacchus! for a flame"
2777,XIV,"Chafes in our blood, O Bromios!"
2778,XIV,"Fire no water e'er could quench,"
2779,XIV,And its heat must scorify us
2780,XIV,If with wine we do not drench.
2781,XIV,Wherefore overbrim the cup:
2782,XIV,"This to Jove now drink I up,"
2783,XIV,Who upon thy first of days
2784,XIV,"Snátched thee and cówed thy natal blaze,"
2785,XIV,Even as 'tis now the merry
2786,XIV,"Strength of this thy vintaged berry,"
2787,XIV,That the scorching danger stays.
2788,XIV,
2789,XIV,To the vine now! let its golden
2790,XIV,Leaves about our brows be folden.
2791,XIV,To the swarthy hand that trims it!
2792,XIV,To the grape! the sun that dims it!
2793,XIV,To the pipe that doth embolden
2794,XIV,Purpled stamping feet to riot
2795,XIV,O'er the vatted winepress olden!
2796,XIV,"To the cavern's depth, chill, quiet!"
2797,XIV,"Last to wine's own ruddy sprite,"
2798,XIV,Wakes in rheumy eyes a light--
2799,XIV,"Ay, and ripens youth to man;"
2800,XIV,Wine which more works than wisdom can;
2801,XIV,Wine that welcomes hardy morrows;
2802,XIV,Wine that turns to song our sorrows;
2803,XIV,Wine the only magian!
2804,XIV,
2805,XIV,Deep now! every bowl enhances
2806,XIV,The world's beauty; see there dances
2807,XIV,In the sky the leaping sun!
2808,XIV,"'Nay, can thine eye catch but one?'"
2809,XIV,"'Six now spin.' 'A seventh advances,"
2810,XIV,"Flares and vomits, swerves and blazes,"
2811,XIV,"Now bursts and countlessly it prances,"
2812,XIV,Pulsing to my frantic paces!'
2813,XIV,"'I flame,--gyrate!' 'I shoot out heat!'"
2814,XIV,"'My tricked speech trips, and trip my feet!'"
2815,XIV,'The earth runs round and heav'n is wheeling!'
2816,XIV,'I sway; I reel.' 'Earth's wrecked and reeling!'
2817,XIV,'Dance on.' 'Earth's gone.' 'All's white and clear!'
2818,XIV,'Ah! Ah! Behind the blaze I hear
2819,XIV,The Oread's laughter pealing!'
2820,XIV,
2821,XIV,"Avaunt, grief! Descend, O holy"
2822,XIV,"Fierce Bacchic rapture, divine folly!"
2823,XIV,
2824,XIV,
2825,XV,XV
2826,XV,
2827,XV,"Forth from the forest wend I slowly,               _Of the Faun's"
2828,XV,While in my ears yet rings the holy             Further Wanderings._
2829,XV,"Dithyramb. The noon is past,"
2830,XV,But the sun rages. There is cast
2831,XV,A dumbness yet o'er earth and sky.
2832,XV,"Down to the river then will I,"
2833,XV,"Slowly about its depths to swim,"
2834,XV,While the stream fondles every limb
2835,XV,"And soothes its ache. Deep I will dip,"
2836,XV,"And, blowing, raise my locks, that drip"
2837,XV,"Till the slim Hyads troop to see,"
2838,XV,"And revel, too, and play with me,"
2839,XV,Hanging my ears with humid weed
2840,XV,Or mounting me as water steed.
2841,XV,"Then, musing I will on, and so"
2842,XV,Stray to where a silver slow
2843,XV,"River circles through the meads,"
2844,XV,"Wherein the mooching great ox feeds,"
2845,XV,"And turns a slow eye round the sky,"
2846,XV,Wondering if he can ever die.
2847,XV,"And there, mayhap, 'twill come to pass"
2848,XV,"I'll hear a sweet voice in the grass,"
2849,XV,"And yet shall mark no singer nigh,"
2850,XV,"Till, gently peering, I espy"
2851,XV,"A solemn, elfish child who sits"
2852,XV,"Unseen mid towering grass, and knits"
2853,XV,"An endless, endless daisy chain,"
2854,XV,Crooning the while some soft refrain
2855,XV,Her mother sings her when she closes
2856,XV,Her twilit eyes.
2857,XV,
2858,XV,"_Little Girl._    Three red, red, roses--"
2859,XV,"One each for father and mother, and one,"
2860,XV,"The reddest of all, for her baby son."
2861,XV,"None for wee Amoret? Oh, none! for she"
2862,XV,"Some day, when she grows up, a red rose will be!"
2863,XV,
2864,XV,"Then, crossed-legged mid the meadow-sweet,            _Of the Faun's"
2865,XV,"I will sink down, laugh low, and greet                 Converse with"
2866,XV,"Her blue, inquiring, childish eyes                       a Small"
2867,XV,"With mine, sharp, merry, brown, and wise,               She-Child._"
2868,XV,And tell her tales--of Jack who slew
2869,XV,Ten giants; or Mirabel who flew
2870,XV,On a white owl to find the Prince
2871,XV,And give to him the Golden Quince
2872,XV,Would change him from a roaring bull
2873,XV,To a youth blithe and beautiful;
2874,XV,"Or tales of the Goblin and the Sloth,"
2875,XV,Who watched the moon and swore an oath
2876,XV,To find out what she was: how these
2877,XV,Explored her mines and found her--cheese.
2878,XV,
2879,XV,Thus will I sit and both amuse
2880,XV,Until I rise and beg excuse:
2881,XV,Off 'to El Raschid in Assyria'
2882,XV,"Or 'the Grand-Duchess of Illyria,'"
2883,XV,Or 'to ask the maiden moon
2884,XV,Why one only of her shoon
2885,XV,"She left us last night in the sky,"
2886,XV,"And not her silver self, and why"
2887,XV,She always climbs the self-same track?
2888,XV,Lets no one ever see her back?'
2889,XV,
2890,XV,
2891,XVI,XVI
2892,XVI,
2893,XVI,But neither to the moon go I
2894,XVI,"Or to the river gliding by,"
2895,XVI,"But to the woods, therein to move"
2896,XVI,"Among the quiet glades I love,"
2897,XVI,Desiring nought but aye to see
2898,XVI,"The beech, ash, oak, and chestnut tree...."
2899,XVI,Till I a nymph meet who persuades
2900,XVI,"Me to the broadest of the glades,"
2901,XVI,Around whose smooth and sunken space
2902,XVI,"The far woods lie. For in this place,"
2903,XVI,Deserted but for a mid-grove
2904,XVI,"Of maiden trees, bower of the dove,"
2905,XVI,"Pan plays, and should the sylvans chance,"
2906,XVI,"Nymphs, fauns, and sylvans, join in dance."
2907,XVI,
2908,XVI,
2909,XVII,XVII
2910,XVII,
2911,XVII,On either hand the slender trees                    _Of the Immortal
2912,XVII,"Bow to the caressing breeze,                             Dance._"
2913,XVII,And shake their shocks of silver light
2914,XVII,"Against skies marbled greenish-white,"
2915,XVII,"Save where, within a rent of blue,"
2916,XVII,"The tilted slip of moon glints through,"
2917,XVII,Glittering upon us as we dance
2918,XVII,With a soft extravagance
2919,XVII,"Of limbs as blonde as autumn boughs,"
2920,XVII,And gold locks floating from moony brows.
2921,XVII,While anguished Pan the pipes doth blow
2922,XVII,"Fond and tremulous and low,"
2923,XVII,And anon the timbrel shakes.
2924,XVII,--It is his sudden heart that breaks
2925,XVII,"For springs before the world grew old,"
2926,XVII,"Rich vales, and hill-tops fiery cold!--"
2927,XVII,"He watches the scarce moving skies,"
2928,XVII,"The trees, the glittering revelries,"
2929,XVII,"The moon, the dancers lemon-clad:"
2930,XVII,The world fantastical and sad.
2931,XVII,
2932,XVII,The high-flung timbrels pulse and knock;
2933,XVII,"We follow in a dancing flock,"
2934,XVII,"Touching each other's finger-tips,"
2935,XVII,While from between our parted lips
2936,XVII,The solemn melodies repeat
2937,XVII,The rhythm of our shaken feet.
2938,XVII,"Then faster! and the round we trace,"
2939,XVII,"Hair flowing from elated face,"
2940,XVII,"Eyes lit, breast bare, with lifted knees,"
2941,XVII,And hands that toss as toss the trees....
2942,XVII,"And slow again ... with cumulate motion,"
2943,XVII,As the long draw and plunge of ocean
2944,XVII,Bursting in a cloud of spray
2945,XVII,"Up a white, deserted bay"
2946,XVII,"Of the sun-circled green Bermooths,"
2947,XVII,Whose blistering sands the cool foam soothes....
2948,XVII,Next the bewildering pipes may sing
2949,XVII,"Some simple melody of spring,"
2950,XVII,Whose cadences remember yet
2951,XVII,Sadly lost springs that we forget.
2952,XVII,To which as dances April rain
2953,XVII,"On a still pool where leans no stain,"
2954,XVII,Save of the cloud's pure splendour spread
2955,XVII,"Gloriously overhead,"
2956,XVII,"Our fast-flickering feet shall twinkle,"
2957,XVII,"And our golden anklets tinkle,"
2958,XVII,While fair arms in aery sleeves
2959,XVII,Shiver as the poplar's leaves.
2960,XVII,
2961,XVII,And all the while shall Pan sit by
2962,XVII,"And play, and pause, perhaps, to sigh,"
2963,XVII,"Viewing the scarce-moving skies,"
2964,XVII,"The hushed and glittering revelries,"
2965,XVII,"The infant moon, the slender trees"
2966,XVII,"Silvering to the shivery breeze,"
2967,XVII,"The fair, lorn dancers lemon-clad:"
2968,XVII,The world fantastical and sad.
2969,XVII,
2970,XVII,
2971,XVIII,XVIII
2972,XVIII,
2973,XVIII,Thus may we dance the light away
2974,XVIII,Of yet one more unmemoried day.
2975,XVIII,"But, the dance ended, I will go"
2976,XVIII,Beyond the reach of pipes that blow
2977,XVIII,A sadness thrilling through my veins....
2978,XVIII,
2979,XVIII,For now within my spirit reigns                          _The Faun's
2980,XVIII,"Shadow: before whose brooding face,                       Sadness._"
2981,XVIII,"Silent, there trail on gliding pace"
2982,XVIII,"A multitude of restless Fears,"
2983,XVIII,"Obscure Griefs and obscurer Tears,"
2984,XVIII,"Bewildered Sighs, waned Phantasies,"
2985,XVIII,"And all disastrous Presences,"
2986,XVIII,Mutely prophetic of a Woe
2987,XVIII,"I know not yet, but I shall know."
2988,XVIII,
2989,XVIII,"Such power Pan's grief hath to oppress,"
2990,XVIII,And Memory!--since now I guess
2991,XVIII,Only too well that there must come
2992,XVIII,"Twilight, Calamity, and Doom."
2993,XVIII,
2994,XVIII,For once I saw beneath an oak
2995,XVIII,A bard so aged it seemed he woke
2996,XVIII,That moment from a sleep of years
2997,XVIII,And in his voice were sleep and tears....
2998,XVIII,"Till, wide-eyed, he, raging, spake,"
2999,XVIII,Rocking as when woodlands shake
3000,XVIII,"Under the first urge of the wind,"
3001,XVIII,Whose roaring murk lightens behind.
3002,XVIII,
3003,XVIII,"_Prophetic Bard._ ""Be warned! I feel the world grow old,"
3004,XVIII,And off Olympus fades the gold                              _The
3005,XVIII,Of the simple passionate sun;                             Prophecy._
3006,XVIII,And the Gods wither one by one:
3007,XVIII,"Proud-eyed Apollo's bow is broken,"
3008,XVIII,And throned Zeus nods nor may be woken
3009,XVIII,But by the song of spirits seven
3010,XVIII,Quiring in the midnight heaven
3011,XVIII,"Of a new world no more forlorn,"
3012,XVIII,"Sith unto it a Babe is born,"
3013,XVIII,"That in a propped, thatched stable lies,"
3014,XVIII,"While with darkling, reverend eyes"
3015,XVIII,"Dusky Emperors, coifed in gold,"
3016,XVIII,"Kneel mid the rushy mire, and hold"
3017,XVIII,"Caskets of rubies, urns of myrrh,"
3018,XVIII,Whose fumes enwrap the thurifer
3019,XVIII,And coil toward the high dim rafters
3020,XVIII,"Where, with lutes and warbling laughters,"
3021,XVIII,"Clustered cherubs of rainbow feather,"
3022,XVIII,"Fanning the fragrant air together,"
3023,XVIII,"Flit in jubilant holy glee,"
3024,XVIII,And make heavenly minstrelsy
3025,XVIII,"To the Child their Sun, whose glow"
3026,XVIII,Bathes them His cloudlets from below....
3027,XVIII,"Long shall this chimed accord be heard,"
3028,XVIII,Yet all earth hushed at His first word:
3029,XVIII,Then shall be seen Apollo's car
3030,XVIII,Blaze headlong like a banished star;
3031,XVIII,And the Queen of heavenly Loves
3032,XVIII,Dragged downward by her dying doves;
3033,XVIII,"Vulcan, spun on a wheel, shall track"
3034,XVIII,The circle of the zodiac;
3035,XVIII,"Silver Artemis be lost,"
3036,XVIII,To the polar blizzards tossed;
3037,XVIII,Heaven shall curdle as with blood;
3038,XVIII,The sun be swallowed in the flood;
3039,XVIII,The universe be silent save
3040,XVIII,For the low drone of winds that lave
3041,XVIII,The shadowed great world's ashen sides
3042,XVIII,As through the rustling void she glides.
3043,XVIII,Then shall there be a whisper heard
3044,XVIII,"Of the Grave's Secret and its Word,"
3045,XVIII,Where in black silence none shall cry
3046,XVIII,"Save those who, dead-affrighted, spy"
3047,XVIII,How from the murmurous graveyards creep
3048,XVIII,The figures of eternal sleep.
3049,XVIII,"Last: when 'tis light men shall behold,"
3050,XVIII,"Beyond the crags, a flower of gold"
3051,XVIII,"Blossoming in a golden haze,"
3052,XVIII,"And, while they guess Zeus' halls now blaze"
3053,XVIII,Shall in the blossom's heart descry
3054,XVIII,"The saints of a new hierarchy!"""
3055,XVIII,
3056,XVIII,He ceased ... and in the morning sky
3057,XVIII,Zeus' anger threatened murmurously.
3058,XVIII,I sped away. The lightning's sword
3059,XVIII,Stabbed on the forest. But the word
3060,XVIII,Abides with me. I feel its power
3061,XVIII,"Most darkly in the twilit hour,"
3062,XVIII,"When Night's eternal shadow, cast"
3063,XVIII,"Over earth hushed and pale and vast,"
3064,XVIII,Darkly foretells the soundless Night
3065,XVIII,"In which this orb, so green, so bright,"
3066,XVIII,"Now spins, and which shall compass her"
3067,XVIII,When on her rondure nought shall stir
3068,XVIII,But snow-whorls which the wind shall roll
3069,XVIII,From the Equator to the Pole....
3070,XVIII,
3071,XVIII,For everlastingly there is                            _Of the Final
3072,XVIII,"Something Beyond, Behind: I wis                      Nature of Pan._"
3073,XVIII,"All Gods are haunted, and there clings,"
3074,XVIII,"As hound behind fled sheep, the things"
3075,XVIII,Beyond the Universe's ken:
3076,XVIII,"Gods haunt the Half-Gods, Half-Gods men,"
3077,XVIII,"And Man the brute. Gods, born of Night,"
3078,XVIII,Feel a blacker appetite
3079,XVIII,Gape to devour them; Half-Gods dread
3080,XVIII,But jealous Gods; and mere men tread
3081,XVIII,Warily lest a Half-God rise
3082,XVIII,And loose on them from empty skies
3083,XVIII,"Amazement, thunder, stark affright,"
3084,XVIII,"Famine and sudden War's thick night,"
3085,XVIII,In which loud Furies hunt the Pities
3086,XVIII,"Through smoke above wrecked, flaming cities."
3087,XVIII,
3088,XVIII,"For Pan, the Unknown God, rules all."
3089,XVIII,"He shall outlive the funeral,"
3090,XVIII,"Change, and decay, of many Gods,"
3091,XVIII,"Until he, too, lets fall his rods"
3092,XVIII,Of viewless power upon that minute
3093,XVIII,When Universe cowers at Infinite!
3094,XVIII,
3095,XVIII,
3096,XIX,XIX
3097,XIX,
3098,XIX,"So far my mind runs, yet I see"
3099,XIX,How little faun-philosophy
3100,XIX,"Repays my heart would learn, not teach...."
3101,XIX,"Better laugh long, lie, suck a peach"
3102,XIX,Couched under tiger-lily flowers
3103,XIX,Which daze the low hot sun with showers
3104,XIX,"Of fragrance, while the dusty bee"
3105,XIX,"Drones, fumbles, falls luxuriantly"
3106,XIX,"Within their throats; couched, turn a song"
3107,XIX,Of flowers all the flowers among:
3108,XIX,
3109,XIX,"There is a vale beyond blue Ida's mount,            THE FAUN'S"
3110,XIX,"And thither often would I, piping, stray           AFTERNOON"
3111,XIX,To listen to the music of a fount                      SONG.
3112,XIX,That spelt her tears out in a Dorian lay.
3113,XIX,
3114,XIX,"""Long, long ago,"" she wept, ""Narcissus came"
3115,XIX,Wandering down the sunny-shafted glade;
3116,XIX,Full weary was he of the lamp's gold flame
3117,XIX,Wavering beneath the dusky colonnade.
3118,XIX,
3119,XIX,"""For at the fall of night forth from the dim"
3120,XIX,"Gardens stole Echo; kneeling by his bed,"
3121,XIX,With small sweet love-words she importuned him
3122,XIX,Who watched the lamp flame idle overhead.
3123,XIX,
3124,XIX,"""Dry was her hot flushed cheek and dark the fire"
3125,XIX,In her great eyes; her lips roamed warm and light
3126,XIX,Over his arm; her murmurs of desire
3127,XIX,Mixed with the many murmurs of the night.
3128,XIX,
3129,XIX,"""In vain! He came to rest and sing with me"
3130,XIX,"And loll his fingers in the liquid cool,"
3131,XIX,"And drop slow tears, slow tears luxuriously"
3132,XIX,Into the shadowy motion of the pool.
3133,XIX,
3134,XIX,"""With tongue scarce audible I wooed the lad,"
3135,XIX,Whispering how beneath the drumming fall
3136,XIX,"Slumbers a rapt, deep lake, so blue, so sad,"
3137,XIX,"That no fish swim it, nor about it call"
3138,XIX,
3139,XIX,"""Delighting birds from green-bowered shore to shore,"
3140,XIX,"Nor doth the nightingale, when June begins"
3141,XIX,"And the moon mounts a pattin of bright or,"
3142,XIX,Hymn her long sorrows and her lord's black sins.
3143,XIX,
3144,XIX,"""And the boy answered, answered me, and mourned"
3145,XIX,"The loveliness of Echo. 'Yet,' sighed he,"
3146,XIX,"'My soul is fled, and long, thou knowest, bourned"
3147,XIX,"In what far dell none knoweth, love, but thee"
3148,XIX,
3149,XIX,"""'Who farest thither! Sweeter to my ears"
3150,XIX,Are thy quiet voices and the gentle breast
3151,XIX,Of rambling water sweeter than my dear's.'
3152,XIX,"Then murmured I, 'Lean lower, love, and rest.'"
3153,XIX,
3154,XIX,"""There was no sound through all the sleeping wood,"
3155,XIX,"Save one sharp cry from Echo, open-lipped,"
3156,XIX,"Who, as she followed, from afar did spy"
3157,XIX,How to my arms my lover downward slipped.
3158,XIX,
3159,XIX,"""Softly I rocked him down into the pool,"
3160,XIX,"Shutting his ears to the loud torrents' din,"
3161,XIX,"And kissed and bore him through the portals cool,"
3162,XIX,And laid him sleeping the blue halls within.
3163,XIX,
3164,XIX,"""So I returned; but never to me came"
3165,XIX,"Another as beautiful, nor shall come."
3166,XIX,"Lonely I flow, and, flowing, lisp his name,"
3167,XIX,"Till the sky waste and all the earth be dumb."""
3168,XIX,
3169,XIX,"So sang the spring, and, answering my look,"
3170,XIX,Through the dark wood from the spring's fountain-head
3171,XIX,"Flock upon flock of eyed narcissi shook,"
3172,XIX,And the brook wept in sorrow for the dead.
3173,XIX,
3174,XIX,"Ah, Death again! nothing can fend"
3175,XIX,"Us from the Sibyl of the End,"
3176,XIX,"Whose delight 'tis to find new forms,"
3177,XIX,"Now in dull sighs, anon in storms,"
3178,XIX,"Singing, and ever of the same:"
3179,XIX,The trusting heart betrayed; the flame
3180,XIX,Whirled in a night on cities proud;
3181,XIX,Lightnings from skies undimmed by cloud;
3182,XIX,The wide grave yawned before swift feet;
3183,XIX,The small success that brings defeat;
3184,XIX,The smiling lips and deadly eyes
3185,XIX,Of Destiny walking in disguise.
3186,XIX,
3187,XIX,
3188,XX,XX
3189,XX,
3190,XX,But now the sun sinks I will go                         _Of the
3191,XX,"Whither two full streams meet and flow,              Evening River._"
3192,XX,Murmuring as in wedded sleep
3193,XX,Through evening meadows dim and deep.
3194,XX,There will I watch the slow trout rise
3195,XX,"At the myriad simmering flies,"
3196,XX,And listen to the water flowing
3197,XX,With such faint sounds there is no knowing
3198,XX,Whether its spirit laughs or weeps
3199,XX,Among the dreams wherein it sleeps.
3200,XX,
3201,XX,"Sunken amid the twilight grass,"
3202,XX,"I will watch the water pass,"
3203,XX,Weaving ever dimmer tales
3204,XX,And dimmer as the evening pales....
3205,XX,Till from the calm the silent lark
3206,XX,"Drops to the meadows hushed and dark,"
3207,XX,"While in the stagnant silver west,"
3208,XX,"Above the tranquil poplars' crest,"
3209,XX,There glimmers through the murky bar
3210,XX,The slowly climbing Hesperal Star.
3211,XX,
3212,XX,"Thus brooding by the hazy stream,"
3213,XX,I shall hear the water dream
3214,XX,"Tinkily on, and I shall see,"
3215,XX,As my eyes close quietly.
3216,XX,"Into a soft and long repose,"
3217,XX,The lone star like a silver rose
3218,XX,Fade with me on the drifting stream
3219,XX,Into the quiet night of dream.
3220,XX,
3221,XX,Yet sleep I not; for lo! there wakes                    _Of Night's
3222,XX,From the dim water-meadow brakes                        Rhapsodist._
3223,XX,"A quiring: voice as if a star,"
3224,XX,Fallen to earth from midnight far
3225,XX,"Beyond the haze of highest cloud,"
3226,XX,Bewailed her errëd path aloud.
3227,XX,"It is the nightingale who sings,"
3228,XX,"Fanning soft air with whirrëd wings,"
3229,XX,Probing the dark with jewelled eyes.
3230,XX,"How oft, how sad, how loud she cries!"
3231,XX,And all the echoes answer her;
3232,XX,The night airs through the close wood stir
3233,XX,The stars that through the eddies climb
3234,XX,Glitter; the silver waters chime;
3235,XX,The lily bows her dewy head....
3236,XX,
3237,XX,"I, too, a sudden tear have shed."
3238,XX,"For, ah! what voice is this can make"
3239,XX,The vagrant heart within me ache?
3240,XX,"That stirs an ancient tenderness,"
3241,XX,"A new need to console, love, bless"
3242,XX,All things that 'neath this warm night sky
3243,XX,"Rejoice and suffer, age and die?"
3244,XX,"Hunger is in my heart like bliss,--"
3245,XX,"I stretch my arms out and I kiss,"
3246,XX,"Gathered in sad and sweet embrace,"
3247,XX,The whole world's dark and simple face.

3250,XXI,XXI
3251,XXI,
3252,XXI,I wander forth. About my feet                          _Of the
3253,XXI,The sward is fresh and doubly sweet                  Second Singer._
3254,XXI,The loved air on my salvëd brow.
3255,XXI,Be still. Be still. For hearken: now
3256,XXI,A second voice behind the grove
3257,XXI,Uprises tremulous with love.
3258,XXI,"How hushed, how moody is the strain!"
3259,XXI,"Pleading--O, surely, not in vain!"
3260,XXI,"Sombrely rises every note,"
3261,XXI,"Lingers, and in dark dells remote"
3262,XXI,Echoes until another come.
3263,XXI,
3264,XXI,Philomel herself falls dumb.
3265,XXI,
3266,XXI,"Philomel herself falls dumb,"
3267,XXI,Mindful of her shadowy home;
3268,XXI,Of a slowly falling surge
3269,XXI,Sounding its unending dirge
3270,XXI,On an alien ocean's verge;
3271,XXI,Of a rain-smitten tower that stood
3272,XXI,"Fronting the calm, pale rolling flood;"
3273,XXI,"Of a slim sister's beauty glows,"
3274,XXI,Fatefuller than a midnight rose;
3275,XXI,"Of the birth, growth, and scheming dire,"
3276,XXI,Of an accursëd King's desire;
3277,XXI,"Of night-long vigil, tongueless wrack,"
3278,XXI,And the last exultation black
3279,XXI,"O'er loathly offering, feasting sour,"
3280,XXI,"A fell cry in the lonely tower,"
3281,XXI,"Raging pursuit, flight's vain endeavour,"
3282,XXI,And Vengeance stilling all for ever.--
3283,XXI,Save the voice that nightly cries
3284,XXI,To the slowly wheeling skies
3285,XXI,"Of unrest resolved in calm,"
3286,XXI,"Time's tears fallen like a balm,"
3287,XXI,"Sorrows that dead hearts have wrung,"
3288,XXI,"By the sad Enthusiast sung,"
3289,XXI,Sweeter than Euphrosyne's tongue.
3290,XXI,
3291,XXI,O tremulous voice! who is 't that shakes
3292,XXI,The night with fervour?
3293,XXI,Through the brakes
3294,XXI,"Softly I thread ... emerge, and now"
3295,XXI,Across the rising meadow's brow
3296,XXI,"I glimpse, beside the farther wood,"
3297,XXI,"Under the shadow of its hood,"
3298,XXI,A glimmering shape that does not move.
3299,XXI,It is the shepherd and his love:
3300,XXI,"Close, close they stand, swooning and dim;"
3301,XXI,"Her shadowed face looks up at him,"
3302,XXI,Her sighing breath his forehead warms;
3303,XXI,"He sings, she leans within his arms."
3304,XXI,
3305,XXI,_The Shepherd._ Now arched dark boughs hang dim and still;
3306,XXI,The deep dew glistens up the hill;                    THE SHEPHERD'S
3307,XXI,Silence trembles. All is still.                         NIGHT SONG.
3308,XXI,
3309,XXI,"Now the sweet siren of the woods,"
3310,XXI,"Philomel, passionately broods,"
3311,XXI,"Or, darkling, hymns love's wildest moods."
3312,XXI,
3313,XXI,"Danaë, fainting in her tower,"
3314,XXI,"Feels a sudden sun swim lower,"
3315,XXI,Gasps beneath the starry shower.
3316,XXI,
3317,XXI,Venus in the pomegranate grove
3318,XXI,Flutters like a fluttering dove
3319,XXI,Under young Adonis' love.
3320,XXI,
3321,XXI,Leda longs until alight
3322,XXI,In the reeds those wings of white
3323,XXI,She hears beat the upper night.
3324,XXI,
3325,XXI,"Golden now the glowing moon,"
3326,XXI,Diana over Endymion

3330,XXI,"Youth is sweet and Night is free,"

4053,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Kiss! Kiss me and kiss again,"
4054,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,Make kissing almost pain;
4055,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Close your fingers close on mine,"
4056,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,And our grappling looks entwine;
4057,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Kiss again, and when that's done"
4058,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,Blind me with each facing sun
4059,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Of your clear and golden eyes,"
4060,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Till my spirit in me dies,"
4061,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,And endures a long eclipse
4062,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,Till rekindled at your lips.
4063,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,
4064,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,From this minute I pursue
4065,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,The intense Idea that's you--
4066,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,Your you's Being. I would draw
4067,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,You from Obscurity's dusk maw
4068,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Into my hands--whate'er you are,"
4069,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Moth or spirit, gnome or star."
4070,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Yet I would not filch a part,"
4071,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Misty soul or flaming heart,"
4072,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Which left but, as doth the snake,"
4073,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,A pale tissue. I will take
4074,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,And shut all your sweetness up
4075,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"In the gold walls of a cup,"
4076,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Sandalled feet to sweeping hair,"
4077,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Soul, brain, body, all you are--"
4078,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Curled as a mermaid coiled in brine,"
4079,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,Now drunk one gush of giddy wine!
4080,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,
4081,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Nay, as a strange lump of snow"
4082,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"In my two hands you shall go,"
4083,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"And I'll bare my browny breast,"
4084,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Press you there, where now you rest!"
4085,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Ay, and bless the frozen smart"
4086,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,As you melt into my heart!
4087,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,
4088,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Come, I'll twine you round my brows:"
4089,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"A defiant diadem,"
4090,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,Poets of your light shall sing.
4091,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,Satraps by you swear stout vows
4092,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,Eyeing my twice-marvellous gem--
4093,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,You: the emerald in my ring.
4094,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,
4095,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Thus I'll keep you night and day,"
4096,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,Since no stone can run away--
4097,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,And might dare a pleasure splendid:
4098,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Toss my ring into the air,"
4099,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Watch it spinning, heart suspended,"
4100,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Lest it slip me unaware,"
4101,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Fall clean through my finger bars,"
4102,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,Shatter in ten thousand stars!
4103,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,Yet you shall not be my ring;
4104,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"You shall not be any thing,"
4105,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Crown or stone set cunningly,"
4106,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,Time can separate from me.
4107,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,
4108,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"No! I'll find an alchemist,"
4109,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,With a beard of cobwebs grey
4110,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,And fired eyes like moonstones kissed
4111,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"By the last gold beam of day,"
4112,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"And older and gentler than a fish,"
4113,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,And wiser than an elephant;
4114,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"And when I've told him what we wish,"
4115,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,Bribe or force him work our want.
4116,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,
4117,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"We two shall opposëd stand,"
4118,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,Each touch other's finger-tip;
4119,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,At a slow pass of his hand
4120,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"And a soft word from his lip,"
4121,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"We will incline smilingly,"
4122,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"And as drops together run,"
4123,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,"Shaking off the he and she,"
4124,MAN'S ANACREONTIC,Close and be forever one.
