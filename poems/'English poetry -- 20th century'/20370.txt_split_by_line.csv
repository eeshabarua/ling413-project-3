53,AUTHOR'S NOTE,Nearly all the verses that now make their first appearance in book
54,AUTHOR'S NOTE,"form are reprinted from _Punch_, by kind permission of Messrs."
55,AUTHOR'S NOTE,Bradbury and Agnew. The rest I have taken from two little books that
56,AUTHOR'S NOTE,"were published in Bombay during my last (and, I suppose, final) tour"
57,AUTHOR'S NOTE,of service in India. They contained a good deal of work that was too
58,AUTHOR'S NOTE,"local or topical in interest to stand reproduction, and--especially"
59,AUTHOR'S NOTE,"the elder, which is out of print--some that I would sooner bury than"
60,AUTHOR'S NOTE,"perpetuate. The rest I have overhauled, and included in this"
61,AUTHOR'S NOTE,re-collection.
62,AUTHOR'S NOTE,
63,AUTHOR'S NOTE,"Readers in, or of, India have been kind enough to regard my previous"
64,AUTHOR'S NOTE,efforts with favour. I hope that this little volume will find them no
65,AUTHOR'S NOTE,"less benevolently disposed, and that at the same time it may not be"
66,AUTHOR'S NOTE,without interest to those whose knowledge of the Shiny East is derived
67,AUTHOR'S NOTE,from hearsay.

152,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"'Where ignorance is bliss,"
153,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,'Tis folly to be wise.'
154,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,
155,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,
156,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,The time-gun rolls his nerve-destroying bray;
157,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,The toiling moon rides slowly o'er the trees;
158,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"The weary diners cast their cares away,"
159,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,And seek the lawn for coolness and for ease.
160,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,
161,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"Now spreads the gathering stillness like a pall,"
162,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"And melancholy silence rules the scene,"
163,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"Save where the bugler sounds his homing call,"
164,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,And thirsty THOMAS leaves the wet canteen;
165,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,
166,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,Save that from yonder lines in deepest gloom
167,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"Th' ambiguous mule does of the stick[1] bewail,"
168,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,Whose _dunder_ craft forbids him to consume
169,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"His proper blanket, or his neighbour's tail."
170,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,
171,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,[Footnote 1: The _dunder-stick_--an ingenious instrument devised to
172,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,defeat this extraordinary appetite.]
173,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,
174,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"Beneath those jagged tiles, that low-built roof"
175,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"(Whose inmost secret deeps let none divine!),"
176,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"Each to his master's cry supremely proof,"
177,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,The Aryan Brothers of our household dine.
178,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,
179,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"Let not Presumption mock their joyless pile,--"
180,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"The cold boiled rice, in native butter greased;"
181,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"Nor scorn, with rising gorge and painful smile,"
182,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,The cheap but filling flapjacks of the East.
183,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,
184,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,Full many a gem of highest Art-cuisine
185,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,Those dark unfathomed dogmatists eschew;
186,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,Full many a 'dish to set before the Queen'
187,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,Would waste its sweetness on the mild Hindoo.
188,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,
189,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"Nor you, their lords, expect of these the toil,"
190,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"When o'er their minds a soft oblivion steals,"
191,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,And through the long-drawn hookah's pliant coil
192,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"They soothe their senses, and digest their meals."
193,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,
194,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"For Knowledge to their ears her ample store,"
195,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"Rich with the latest news, does then impart,"
196,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"Whose source, when known, shall chill you to the core,"
197,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,And freeze the genial cockles of the heart.
198,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,
199,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"For once, to dumb Neglectfulness a prey,"
200,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"Resentment led me undetected near,"
201,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"To know the reason of this cool delay,"
202,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,And teach my trusty pluralist to hear.
203,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,
204,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,There to my vassals' ruminating throng
205,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"Some total stranger, seated on a pail,"
206,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"Perused, translating as he went along,"
207,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,My private letters by the current mail.
208,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,
209,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"One moment, horror baulked my strong intent;"
210,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"Next o'er the compound wall we saw him go,"
211,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,"While uncouth moan, with hapless gesture blent,"
212,NOCTURNE WRITTEN IN AN INDIAN GARDEN,Deplored the pressing tribute of the toe.

218,THE MORAL,Some moral tag this closing verse applies;
219,THE MORAL,E'en from the old the voice of Wisdom speaks--
220,THE MORAL,Even the youngest are not always wise!
221,THE MORAL,
222,THE MORAL,"No further seek to probe the Best Unknown,"

263,DURBAR,"Now the busy screw is churning,"
264,DURBAR,Now the horrid sirens blow;
265,DURBAR,Now are India's guests returning
266,DURBAR,Home from India's Greatest Show;
267,DURBAR,Now the gleeful Asiatic
268,DURBAR,"Speeds them on their wild career,"
269,DURBAR,"And, though normally phlegmatic,"
270,DURBAR,Gives a half-unconscious cheer.
271,DURBAR,
272,DURBAR,"India's years were years of leanness,"
273,DURBAR,Till the Late Performance drew
274,DURBAR,"These, whose confidential greenness"
275,DURBAR,She has run for all she knew.
276,DURBAR,Gladly rose the land to bid them
277,DURBAR,Welcome for a fleeting spell--
278,DURBAR,Nobly took them in and did them--
279,DURBAR,And has done extremely well.

313,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,
314,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"In the dim and distant ages, in the half-forgotten days,"
315,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"Ere the East became the fashion and an Indian tour the craze,"
316,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"Lived a certain Major-General, renowned throughout the State"
317,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,As a soldier of distinction and considerable weight.
318,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,
319,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"But though weightiness of mind is an invaluable trait,"
320,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,When applied to adiposity it's all the other way;
321,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,And our hero was confronted with an ever-growing lack
322,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,Of the necessary charger and the hygienic hack.
323,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,
324,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"He had bought them by the dozen, he had tried them by the score,"
325,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,But not one of them was equal to the burden that he bore;
326,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"They were conscious of the honour, they were sound in wind and limb,"
327,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"They could carry a cathedral, but they drew the line at _him_."
328,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,
329,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"But he stuck to it, till finally his pressing needs were filled"
330,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"By the mammoth of his species, a Leviathan in build,"
331,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"A superb upstanding brown, of unexceptionable bone,"
332,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,And phenomenally qualified to carry twenty stone.
333,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,
334,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,And the General was happy; for the noble creature showed
335,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,An unruffled acquiescence with the nature of his load;
336,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"Till without the slightest warning, that superb upstanding brown"
337,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"Thought it time to make a protest, which he did by lying down."
338,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,
339,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"They appealed to him, reproached him, gave him sugar, cut his feed,"
340,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"But in vain; for almost daily that inexorable steed,"
341,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"When he heard his master coming, looked insultingly around,"
342,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,And with cool deliberation laid him down upon the ground.
343,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,
344,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"But they fought it out between them, till the undefeated brute"
345,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,Made a humorous obeisance at the General Salute!
346,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"Then his owner kicked him wildly in the stomach for his pranks,"
347,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"Said he'd stand the beast no longer, and returned him to the ranks."
348,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,
349,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,(_An interval of about three years._)
350,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,
351,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,Time has dulled our hero's anguish; time has raised our man of weight
352,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,To an even higher office in the service of the State;
353,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"And we find him at his yearly tour, inspecting at his ease"
354,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"A distinguished corps of cavalry, the Someone's Own D. G.'s."
355,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,
356,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"And our fat but famous man of war, accoutred to the nines,"
357,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"Was engaged in making rude remarks, and going round the lines,"
358,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,When he suddenly beheld across an intervening space
359,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"A Leviathan of horseflesh, the Behemoth of his race."
360,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,
361,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"'Colonel Robinson,' he shouted, with enthusiastic force,"
362,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"'A remarkably fine horse, sir!' The remarkably fine horse"
363,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,"Gave a reminiscent shudder, looked insultingly around,"
364,A SOLDIER OF WEIGHT,And with cold deliberation laid him down upon the ground!

1581,THE LAST HOCKEY,Hewing and hacking. Little need to tell
1582,THE LAST HOCKEY,Of Susan in her glory; whom she smote
1583,THE LAST HOCKEY,"She felled, and whom she shocked she overthrew;"
1584,THE LAST HOCKEY,"And, shrieking, passed exultant to her doom."
1585,THE LAST HOCKEY,
1586,THE LAST HOCKEY,"For Susan, while she clove a devious course,"
1587,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Moved crab-like, in a strange diagonal,"
1588,THE LAST HOCKEY,"And, driving, crossed the frontiers. Thither came"
1589,THE LAST HOCKEY,"The bold Sir Referee, and shrilled abroad"
1590,THE LAST HOCKEY,"The tremulous, momentary 'touch.' But she,"
1591,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Heaving with unaccustomed exercise,"
1592,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Blinded and baffled, wild with all despair,"
1593,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Stood sweeping, as a churl that sweeps the scythe"
1594,THE LAST HOCKEY,"In earlier pastures. Twice he skipped, and poured"
1595,THE LAST HOCKEY,"The desperate whistle. Once again, and he,"
1596,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Skipping, diffused the whistle. But at last,"
1597,THE LAST HOCKEY,"So shrewd a blow she dealt him on the shin,"
1598,THE LAST HOCKEY,"That had he stood reverse-wise on his head,"
1599,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Not on his feet, I know not what had chanced."
1600,THE LAST HOCKEY,Then to the shuddering Orient skies there rose
1601,THE LAST HOCKEY,"A marvellous great shriek, the splintering noise"
1602,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Of shattered ash-plant and of battered shank,"
1603,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Mixed with a higher. For Susan, overwrought,"
1604,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Lost footing, and with one clear dolorous wail"
1605,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Fell headlong, only more so. And I saw,"
1606,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Clothed in black stockings, mystic, wonderful,"
1607,THE LAST HOCKEY,That which I saw. The coolies yelled. The crowd
1608,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Closed round, and so the tourney reached an end."
1609,THE LAST HOCKEY,
1610,THE LAST HOCKEY,Then home they bore the bold Sir Referee
1611,THE LAST HOCKEY,In Susan's litter; and they tended him
1612,THE LAST HOCKEY,With curious tendance; and they drowned his views
1613,THE LAST HOCKEY,"On Susan, and the tourney, and the place"
1614,THE LAST HOCKEY,Whither he'd see them ere again he ruled
1615,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Such functions, with a sweet, small song (I call"
1616,THE LAST HOCKEY,It sweet that should not!). This is how it ran:--
1617,THE LAST HOCKEY,
1618,THE LAST HOCKEY,"'Our Referee has fall'n, has fall'n. The stick,"
1619,THE LAST HOCKEY,The little stick he leapt at in the lists
1620,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Has riven and cleft the bark, and raised a bulk"
1621,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Of crescent span, that spreads on every side"
1622,THE LAST HOCKEY,"A thousand hues, all flushing into one."
1623,THE LAST HOCKEY,
1624,THE LAST HOCKEY,"'Our Referee has fall'n, has fall'n. She came,"
1625,THE LAST HOCKEY,"The woman with her ash, and lo the wound!"
1626,THE LAST HOCKEY,"But we will make a bandage for the limb,"
1627,THE LAST HOCKEY,"And swathe it, heel to knee, with splints and wool,"
1628,THE LAST HOCKEY,And embrocations for the hurts of man.
1629,THE LAST HOCKEY,
1630,THE LAST HOCKEY,"'Our Referee has fall'n, has fall'n; he wailed;"
1631,THE LAST HOCKEY,"With our own ears we heard him, and we knew"
1632,THE LAST HOCKEY,_There dwelt an iron nature in the grain_!
1633,THE LAST HOCKEY,The splintering ash was cloven on his limb;
1634,THE LAST HOCKEY,His limb was battered to the cannon-bone.'
1635,THE LAST HOCKEY,
1636,THE LAST HOCKEY,So passed that stout but choleric knight away;
1637,THE LAST HOCKEY,"And we, by certain wandering instincts led,"
1638,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Made for a small pavilion, where we found"
1639,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Viands and what not, and the thirsty flower"
1640,THE LAST HOCKEY,Of mountain knighthood gathered at the board.
1641,THE LAST HOCKEY,"And entering, here we lingered, and discussed"
1642,THE LAST HOCKEY,"The what not, and the viands, and in time"
1643,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Drew to the tourney, giving each his views;--"
1644,THE LAST HOCKEY,But mostly wondering what the coolies thought
1645,THE LAST HOCKEY,"To see these ladies of the Ruling Race,"
1646,THE LAST HOCKEY,"'Yoked in all _exercise_ of noble end,'"
1647,THE LAST HOCKEY,And Public Exhibition. Was it wise?
1648,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Some questioned; others, was it quite the thing?"
1649,THE LAST HOCKEY,
1650,THE LAST HOCKEY,"And here indeed we left it, for the shades"
1651,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Deepened, the high, swift-narrowing crest of day"
1652,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Brake from the hills, and down the path we went,"
1653,THE LAST HOCKEY,"Well pleased, for it was guest-night at the Club."

2326,HAVEN,To that full calm which may be justly called
2327,HAVEN,"Seraphic,"
2328,HAVEN,
2329,HAVEN,"I praise the gods; and vow, for my escape"
2330,HAVEN,"From the hard grip of premature Jehannun,"
2331,HAVEN,One golden-tissued bottle of the grape
2332,HAVEN,Per annum.
2333,HAVEN,
2334,HAVEN,"For on this day, from Orient toils enlarged,"
2335,HAVEN,"Kneeling, I kissed the parent soil at Dover,"
2336,HAVEN,Where a huge porter in his orbit charged
2337,HAVEN,Me over;
2338,HAVEN,
2339,HAVEN,Flashed in the train by Shorncliffe's draughty camp;
2340,HAVEN,"Gazed on the hurrying landscape's pastoral graces,"
2341,HAVEN,"Old farms, and happy fields (a trifle damp"
2342,HAVEN,In places);
2343,HAVEN,
2344,HAVEN,"Passed the grim suburbs, indigent and bare"
2345,HAVEN,"Of natural foliage, but bravely flying"
2346,HAVEN,Frank garlandry of last week's underwear
2347,HAVEN,Out drying;
2348,HAVEN,
2349,HAVEN,And so to Town; and with that blessed sight
2350,HAVEN,"I, a poor fevered wreck, forgot to shiver--"
2351,HAVEN,Forgot to mourn the Burden of my White
2352,HAVEN,Man's Liver;
2353,HAVEN,
2354,HAVEN,"And felt my bosom heave, my breast expand,"
2355,HAVEN,"With thoughts too sweet, too deep for empty cackle,"
2356,HAVEN,Such thoughts as nothing but a first-class Band
2357,HAVEN,Could tackle:
2358,HAVEN,
2359,HAVEN,"Till, from its deeps, my celebrated smile"
2360,HAVEN,"(Which friends called Marvel) clove my jaws asunder,"
2361,HAVEN,"Lucid, intense, and all men stood awhile"
2362,HAVEN,In wonder!

2365,HAVEN,
2366,HAVEN,"Let none approach me now, for I have dined;"
2367,HAVEN,The fire is bright; Havana's choice aroma
2368,HAVEN,Infects my being with a pleasant kind
2369,HAVEN,Of coma;
2370,HAVEN,
2371,HAVEN,Calmly I contemplate my future lot:
2372,HAVEN,I reconstruct the past--it fails to strike me
2373,HAVEN,With aught of horror (pity there are not
2374,HAVEN,More like me!)--
2375,HAVEN,
2376,HAVEN,My bosom's lord sits lightly on my breast;
2377,HAVEN,The East grows dim; and every hour I stuck to it
2378,HAVEN,"Imparts a richer brightness to the West,"
2379,HAVEN,Good luck to it!
