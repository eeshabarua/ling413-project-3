121,TO VIOLA.,
122,TO VIOLA.,
123,TO VIOLA.,"Man cannot be a sophist to his heart,"
124,TO VIOLA.,"He must look nakedly on his intent,"
125,TO VIOLA.,"Expose it of all shreds of argument,"
126,TO VIOLA.,And strip it like a slave-girl in the mart.
127,TO VIOLA.,What though with speckled truths and masked confessions
128,TO VIOLA.,He still deceives awhile the outer sense?
129,TO VIOLA.,At barely half his honesty’s expense
130,TO VIOLA.,Still earns the world’s excuse for the world’s transgressions?
131,TO VIOLA.,
132,TO VIOLA.,"His conscience cannot play the marshland elf,"
133,TO VIOLA.,"Confusing that poor midnight wanderer,"
134,TO VIOLA.,"His soul, with floundering lights and errant gleams."
135,TO VIOLA.,O what damnation man would deal himself
136,TO VIOLA.,If meeting her beyond his uttermost dreams
137,TO VIOLA.,He still could face his soul and lie to her.
138,TO VIOLA.,
139,TO VIOLA.,
140,II.,II.
141,II.,
142,II.,O spare me from the hand of niggard love
143,II.,"That grasps at interest on what it lends,"
144,II.,And sets cold counsel as a guard above
145,II.,The hoard it calculates before it spends.
146,II.,Such misers of the riches of the heart
147,II.,"Bear their untested treasure to the grave,"
148,II.,"And miss the whole, striving to save the part,"
149,II.,By the bare measure they have striven to save.
150,II.,
151,II.,Is it for pride in saying at the end:
152,II.,"See, Life! I spent not all that thou hast given--"
153,II.,"Lo, this and this and this I did not spend!"
154,II.,I stinted earth of bliss to add to heaven.
155,II.,"Alas, poor fools! life only gave ye this"
156,II.,Because earth has such need of heavenly bliss.
157,II.,
158,II.,
159,III.,III.
160,III.,
161,III.,"Once, Love, be prodigal, nor look hereafter,"
162,III.,Not though experience unrolls the years
163,III.,And bids thee count the cost of golden laughter
164,III.,In the dull coinage of leaden tears.
165,III.,O perjured wisdom! half-truth hedged with lies!
166,III.,"That makes a common stake of joy and pain,"
167,III.,When tears are man’s most mortal certainties
168,III.,And every instant’s joy his heavenly gain.
169,III.,
170,III.,"Ah, mystery that sowed our breath and being,"
171,III.,What harvest wilt thou get of untilled powers?
172,III.,Why didst thou give us sight if not for seeing?
173,III.,Why if we dare not hear make hearing ours?
174,III.,Or why in life’s name this high passion of love
175,III.,But in life’s name its passionate height to prove?
176,III.,
177,III.,
178,IV.,IV.
179,IV.,
180,IV.,Wilt thou put seals on love because men say
181,IV.,Love is a thing that certain time will steal?
182,IV.,"As well, since night is certain after day,"
183,IV.,Might men their eyelids to the noontide seal.
184,IV.,"Nay! even though that worn-out tale were truth,"
185,IV.,"And love, dear love, were time’s assurèd dower,"
186,IV.,What profit canst thou get of cheated youth
187,IV.,By paying usury before his hour?
188,IV.,
189,IV.,"I will not hear the sorry tune of time,"
190,IV.,That bitter quencher of young blessedness.
191,IV.,"Not to have proved young rapture is the crime,"
192,IV.,"Unproven it will be quenched no less, no less."
193,IV.,"And thou wilt to the earth at last, time’s scorn,"
194,IV.,Relinquishing a crown thou hast not worn.
195,IV.,
196,IV.,
197,V.,V.
198,V.,
199,V.,"When all is said, we can but turn our eyes"
200,V.,In helplessness on the miraculous heart
201,V.,And secretly dream opportunities
202,V.,That shall its untried force in motion start;
203,V.,"But life that launched and left us lets us drift,"
204,V.,"Our mightiest dreams still lean on circumstance,"
205,V.,The essence of pain and joy is in our gift
206,V.,But not its seasons of significance.
207,V.,
208,V.,We cannot by the strength of our desires
209,V.,Compel our destinies; we only feel
210,V.,That in our souls imperishable fires
211,V.,Are hungry for the anvil and the steel.
212,V.,But if life brings no metal to the flame
213,V.,What shall we fashion of it in life’s name?
214,V.,
215,V.,
216,VI.,VI.
217,VI.,
218,VI.,Certain among us walk in loneliness
219,VI.,"Along the pale unprofitable days,"
220,VI.,Hazarding many an unanswered guess
221,VI.,At what vague purpose wastes us on our ways.
222,VI.,"We know that we are potent to create,"
223,VI.,"We say, I could be such or such or such,"
224,VI.,"And lo, indifferent death swings back the gate"
225,VI.,And life has never put us to the touch.
226,VI.,
227,VI.,So women with the aching will to bear
228,VI.,"Still to the barren grave must barren go,"
229,VI.,And men that might again like Titans dare
230,VI.,"Angelic secrets, die and nothing know."
231,VI.,Alas! why were we born to woe and bliss
232,VI.,If life had no more need of us than this?
233,VI.,
234,VI.,
235,VII.,VII.
236,VII.,
237,VII.,When I see two delay their wings at heaven
238,VII.,"To scan the creeping audience of the earth,"
239,VII.,I think the angelic hosts of life must even
240,VII.,"Break into tears of fire or furious mirth,"
241,VII.,That ever spirits nearly perfected
242,VII.,"Should count the cost of knowing themselves sublime,"
243,VII.,Setting the measurable years in dread
244,VII.,Against their single flash of measureless time.
245,VII.,
246,VII.,"So issues strange to nature are debated,"
247,VII.,"Woven in nets and beaten into bars,"
248,VII.,While nature’s issue stands unconsummated
249,VII.,Upon the very boundary of the stars;
250,VII.,And souls whose unity had been divine
251,VII.,Sundered shrink back from God’s to man’s design.
252,VII.,
253,VII.,
254,VIII.,VIII.
255,VIII.,
256,VIII.,"Alas, that ever life’s sleek counterfeit,"
257,VIII.,"Convention, should usurp life’s very throne,"
258,VIII.,Setting about the bitter and the sweet
259,VIII.,Observances the soul disdains to own.
260,VIII.,It muffles up with bland expedient tongue
261,VIII.,"The wise examination of the mind,"
262,VIII.,Bribing the old and threatening the young
263,VIII.,And offering easy conduct to the blind.
264,VIII.,
265,VIII.,"A handbook of few rules for many cases,"
266,VIII.,"One answer to more sums than it can prove,"
267,VIII.,"With prizes for apt scholars in its paces,"
268,VIII.,A veil for knowledge and a ring for love;
269,VIII.,And this smooth text for any questioning heart--
270,VIII.,"Know not, and be less than, the thing thou art."
271,VIII.,
272,VIII.,
273,IX.,IX.
274,IX.,
275,IX.,"Love needs not two the render it complete,"
276,IX.,O certainly love needs not even one!
277,IX.,"Sweet singing wants no listener to be sweet,"
278,IX.,And unseen light’s still proper to the sun.
279,IX.,When sunlight falls upon unpeopled valleys
280,IX.,"No presence can increase or dim its fall,"
281,IX.,When nightingales sing in deserted alleys
282,IX.,No ear can make the night more musical.
283,IX.,
284,IX.,If solitary into the light and song
285,IX.,"I come, I know I have my treasure whole,"
286,IX.,"Yea, and still have it whole, although a throng"
287,IX.,"Runs after me down paths whereby I stole,"
288,IX.,"Yea, and still have it whole, though only one"
289,IX.,"Should follow me--or none, beloved, or none."
290,IX.,
291,IX.,
292,X.,X.
293,X.,
294,X.,What is this anguish then that always stands
295,X.,"Mingled in love, if love be love’s sole end?"
296,X.,O it is life still gasping his commands
297,X.,And crying love therein to stand his friend.
298,X.,"Life drives us all whether we love or no,"
299,X.,"We are life’s purpose, he much less is ours,"
300,X.,And we like panting beasts in harness go
301,X.,While his fierce needs make torments of our powers.
302,X.,
303,X.,Only when love across the heavy fields
304,X.,"Divinely treads to labour with the clods,"
305,X.,"He breaks the goad that life is glad to yield,"
306,X.,And lifts the yoke that bowed us to the sods:
307,X.,"Upstanding, we behold a God revealed,"
308,X.,And serve life’s purpose not like beasts but gods.
309,X.,
310,X.,
311,XI.,XI.
312,XI.,
313,XI.,A few of us who faltered as we fared
314,XI.,"Love has returned for. Still he leads us on,"
315,XI.,But where we walk the furrows are prepared
316,XI.,"And sown and fruitful, and the sowers are gone."
317,XI.,"O love, O love, the way too easy lies!"
318,XI.,"Life on the rough horizon yonder goes,"
319,XI.,"And when I call he will not turn his eyes,"
320,XI.,"But with my brothers sows, and reaps, and sows."
321,XI.,
322,XI.,"Life without love, O bitter, bitterest birth!"
323,XI.,Love without life still leaves us in our need.
324,XI.,"Ah, love, give up to me my patch of earth,"
325,XI.,My pinch of seed! Hast neither earth nor seed?
326,XI.,"Then whence these visions of thy presence born,"
327,XI.,These shining visions of flowers and fruit and corn?
328,XI.,
329,XI.,
330,XII.,XII.
331,XII.,
332,XII.,I hear love answer: Since within the mesh
333,XII.,"Of blood and flesh you labour for awhile,"
334,XII.,"I, even I, must use you in the flesh,"
335,XII.,Leavening it of all the world calls vile.
336,XII.,"I am not nature’s force. O, she will forge"
337,XII.,"Her indomitable end without my aid,"
338,XII.,And men cry out on her with rising gorge
339,XII.,As though they were of other forces made.
340,XII.,
341,XII.,"Not being her bond-slave, I alone can give"
342,XII.,"Visions that are unmingled with her earth,"
343,XII.,But since this present in her habit you live
344,XII.,I must meet nature to fulfil their birth.
345,XII.,"Only when you and I come clear of the clay,"
346,XII.,"Beloved, I will fulfil them as I may."
347,XII.,
348,XII.,
349,XIII.,XIII.
350,XIII.,
351,XIII.,"Thy glance is lovelier than the glance of the moon,"
352,XIII.,"Thy breath more heavenly than the breath of may,"
353,XIII.,"When thou dost gaze my sight begins to swoon,"
354,XIII.,When thou dost breathe my own breath swims away.
355,XIII.,"O love, with strange clear light, with strange dim breath,"
356,XIII.,"Thou dost pervade me, till all strength, all sense,"
357,XIII.,"Dissolve, it may be as they will when death"
358,XIII.,Looses the soul from the body’s impotence.
359,XIII.,
360,XIII.,"The stones I tread no longer solid are,"
361,XIII.,"These narrow houses all are built of air,"
362,XIII.,"Nay, are they on this star, or on that star"
363,XIII.,Distantly trembling? Am I here or there?
364,XIII.,"Love, love, I know not what is near and far,"
365,XIII.,I am with thee and thou art everywhere.
366,XIII.,
367,XIII.,
368,XIV.,XIV.
369,XIV.,
370,XIV.,Now I have love again and life again
371,XIV.,"By either hand, and cannot join their palms;"
372,XIV.,"For me they never will be one but twain,"
373,XIV.,And I from each accept the barest alms.
374,XIV.,"Life’s dole I scatter publicly, love’s lies"
375,XIV.,"Unspent, unspent for ever in my heart--"
376,XIV.,"Poor heart, poor beggar of bleak charities"
377,XIV.,From stores wherein it owns no proper part.
378,XIV.,
379,XIV.,Each knows me for his almsman in distress
380,XIV.,"And brings his mercies to my famished door,"
381,XIV.,"But love asks not who doth my body dress,"
382,XIV.,Nor life who stoops to clothe a heart so poor.
383,XIV.,Why do ye always come in singleness?
384,XIV.,"Meet in me once, and I will want no more."
385,XIV.,
386,XIV.,
387,XV.,XV.
388,XV.,
389,XV.,"Farewell, you children that I might have borne."
390,XV.,"Now must I put you from me year by year,"
391,XV.,Now year by year the root of life be torn
392,XV.,"Out of this womb to which you were so dear,"
393,XV.,Now year by year the milky springs be dried
394,XV.,"Within the sealed-up fountains of my breast,"
395,XV.,Now year by year be to my arms denied
396,XV.,The burden they would break with and be blessed.
397,XV.,
398,XV.,Sometimes I felt your lips and hands so close
399,XV.,"I almost could have plucked you from the dark,"
400,XV.,But now your very dream more distant grows
401,XV.,As my still aching body grows more stark.
402,XV.,"I shall not see you laugh or hear you weep,"
403,XV.,"Kiss you awake, or cover up your sleep."
404,XV.,
405,XV.,
406,XVI.,XVI.
407,XVI.,
408,XVI.,"O lovely life, how you have worn me out"
409,XVI.,"With asking naught and leaving me at large,"
