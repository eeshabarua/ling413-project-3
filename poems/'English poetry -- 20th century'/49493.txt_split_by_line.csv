68,LEDA,"BROWN and bright as an agate, mountain-cool,"
69,LEDA,Eurotas singing slips from pool to pool;
70,LEDA,Down rocky gullies; through the cavernous pines
71,LEDA,And chestnut groves; down where the terraced vines
72,LEDA,And gardens overhang; through valleys grey
73,LEDA,"With olive trees, into a soundless bay"
74,LEDA,Of the Ægean. Silent and asleep
75,LEDA,"Lie those pools now: but where they dream most deep,"
76,LEDA,Men sometimes see ripples of shining hair
77,LEDA,"And the young grace of bodies pale and bare,"
78,LEDA,Shimmering far down—the ghosts these mirrors hold
79,LEDA,"Of all the beauty they beheld of old,"
80,LEDA,"White limbs and heavenly eyes and the hair’s river of gold,"
81,LEDA,For once these banks were peopled: Spartan girls
82,LEDA,"Loosed here their maiden girdles and their curls,"
83,LEDA,And stooping o’er the level water stole
84,LEDA,His darling mirror from the sun through whole
85,LEDA,Rapturous hours of gazing.
86,LEDA,The first star
87,LEDA,"Of all this milky constellation, far"
88,LEDA,"Lovelier than any nymph of wood or green,"
89,LEDA,Was she whom Tyndarus had made his queen
90,LEDA,For her sheer beauty and subtly moving grace—
91,LEDA,"Leda, the fairest of our mortal race."
92,LEDA,
93,LEDA,Hymen had lit his torches but one week
94,LEDA,About her bed (and still o’er her young cheek
95,LEDA,Passed rosy shadows of those thoughts that sped
96,LEDA,"Across her mind, still virgin, still unwed,"
97,LEDA,"For all her body was her own no more),"
98,LEDA,When Leda with her maidens to the shore
99,LEDA,"Of bright Eurotas came, to escape the heat"
100,LEDA,Of summer noon in waters coolly sweet.
101,LEDA,By a brown pool which opened smooth and clear
102,LEDA,Below the wrinkled water of a weir
103,LEDA,They sat them down under an old fir-tree
104,LEDA,To rest: and to the laughing melody
105,LEDA,Of their sweet speech the river’s rippling bore
106,LEDA,"A liquid burden, while the sun did pour"
107,LEDA,Pure colour out of heaven upon the earth.
108,LEDA,The meadows seethed with the incessant mirth
109,LEDA,"Of grasshoppers, seen only when they flew"
110,LEDA,Their curves of scarlet or sudden dazzling blue.
111,LEDA,Within the fir-tree’s round of unpierced shade
112,LEDA,"The maidens sat with laughter and talk, or played,"
113,LEDA,"Gravely intent, their game of knuckle-bones;"
114,LEDA,Or tossed from hand to hand the old dry cones
115,LEDA,Littered about the tree. And one did sing
116,LEDA,"A ballad of some far-off Spartan king,"
117,LEDA,"Who took a wife, but left her, well-away!"
118,LEDA,Slain by his foes upon their wedding-day.
119,LEDA,"“That was a piteous story,” Leda sighed,"
120,LEDA,“To be a widow ere she was a bride.”
121,LEDA,"“Better,” said one, “to live a virgin life"
122,LEDA,"Alone, and never know the name of wife"
123,LEDA,And bear the ugly burden of a child
124,LEDA,"And have great pain by it. Let me live wild,"
125,LEDA,"A bird untamed by man!” “Nay,” cried another,"
126,LEDA,"“I would be wife, if I should not be mother."
127,LEDA,Cypris I honour; let the vulgar pay
128,LEDA,Their gross vows to Lucina when they pray.
129,LEDA,Our finer spirits would be blunted quite
130,LEDA,By bestial teeming; but Love’s rare delight
131,LEDA,Wings the rapt soul towards Olympus’ height.”
132,LEDA,“Delight?” cried Leda. “Love to me has brought
133,LEDA,Nothing but pain and a world of shameful thought.
134,LEDA,"When they say love is sweet, the poets lie;"
135,LEDA,’Tis but a trick to catch poor maidens by.
136,LEDA,What are their boasted pleasures? I am queen
137,LEDA,To the most royal king the world has seen;
138,LEDA,"Therefore I should, if any woman might,"
139,LEDA,Know at its full that exquisite delight.
140,LEDA,Yet these few days since I was made a wife
141,LEDA,"Have held more bitterness than all my life,"
142,LEDA,While I was yet a child.” The great bright tears
143,LEDA,"Slipped through her lashes. “Oh, my childish years!"
144,LEDA,"Years that were all my own, too sadly few,"
145,LEDA,When I was happy—and yet never knew
146,LEDA,How happy till to-day!” Her maidens came
147,LEDA,"About her as she wept, whispering her name,"
148,LEDA,"Leda, sweet Leda, with a hundred dear"
149,LEDA,Caressing words to soothe her heavy cheer.
150,LEDA,At last she started up with a fierce pride
151,LEDA,"Upon her face. “I am a queen,” she cried,"
152,LEDA,"“But had forgotten it a while; and you,"
153,LEDA,"Wenches of mine, you were forgetful too."
154,LEDA,Undress me. We would bathe ourself.” So proud
155,LEDA,"A queen she stood, that all her maidens bowed"
156,LEDA,In trembling fear and scarcely dared approach
157,LEDA,To do her bidding. But at last the brooch
158,LEDA,"Pinned at her shoulder is undone, the wide"
159,LEDA,Girdle of silk beneath her breasts untied;
160,LEDA,"The tunic falls about her feet, and she"
161,LEDA,"Steps from the crocus folds of drapery,"
162,LEDA,"Dazzlingly naked, into the warm sun."
163,LEDA,"God-like she stood; then broke into a run,"
164,LEDA,"Leaping and laughing in the light, as though"
165,LEDA,Life through her veins coursed with so swift a flow
166,LEDA,Of generous blood and fire that to remain
167,LEDA,Too long in statued queenliness were pain
168,LEDA,"To that quick soul, avid of speed and joy."
169,LEDA,"She ran, easily bounding, like a boy,"
170,LEDA,Narrow of haunch and slim and firm of breast.
171,LEDA,"Lovelier she seemed in motion than at rest,"
172,LEDA,"If that might be, when she was never less,"
173,LEDA,"Moving or still, than perfect loveliness."
174,LEDA,"At last, with cheeks afire and heaving flank,"
175,LEDA,"She checked her race, and on the river’s bank"
176,LEDA,Stood looking down at her own echoed shape
177,LEDA,"And at the fish that, aimlessly agape,"
178,LEDA,"Hung midway up their heaven of flawless glass,"
179,LEDA,Like angels waiting for eternity to pass.
180,LEDA,Leda drew breath and plunged; her gasping cry
181,LEDA,Splashed up; the water circled brokenly
182,LEDA,Out from that pearly shudder of dipped limbs;
183,LEDA,"The glittering pool laughed up its flowery brims,"
184,LEDA,"And everything, save the poor fish, rejoiced:"
185,LEDA,"Their idiot contemplation of the Moist,"
186,LEDA,"The Cold, the Watery, was in a trice"
187,LEDA,Ended when Leda broke their crystal paradise.
188,LEDA,
189,LEDA,Jove in his high Olympian chamber lay
190,LEDA,"Hugely supine, striving to charm away"
191,LEDA,"In sleep the long, intolerable noon."
192,LEDA,"But heedless Morpheus still withheld his boon,"
193,LEDA,And Jove upon his silk-pavilioned bed
194,LEDA,Tossed wrathful and awake. His fevered head
195,LEDA,"Swarmed with a thousand fancies, which forecast"
196,LEDA,"Delights to be, or savoured pleasures past."
197,LEDA,"Closing his eyes, he saw his eagle swift,"
198,LEDA,"Headlong as his own thunder, stoop and lift"
199,LEDA,On pinions upward labouring the prize
200,LEDA,Of beauty ravished for the envious skies.
201,LEDA,"He saw again that bright, adulterous pair,"
202,LEDA,"Trapped by the limping husband unaware,"
203,LEDA,"Fast in each other’s arms, and faster in the snare—"
204,LEDA,And laughed remembering. Sometimes his thought
205,LEDA,Went wandering over the earth and sought
206,LEDA,"Familiar places—temples by the sea,"
207,LEDA,Cities and islands; here a sacred tree
208,LEDA,And there a cavern of shy nymphs.
209,LEDA,He rolled
210,LEDA,"About his bed, in many a rich fold"
211,LEDA,"Crumpling his Babylonian coverlet,"
212,LEDA,And yawned and stretched. The smell of his own sweat
213,LEDA,Brought back to mind his Libyan desert-fane
214,LEDA,"Of mottled granite, with its endless train"
215,LEDA,"Of pilgrim camels, reeking towards the sky"
216,LEDA,Ammonian incense to his hornèd deity;
217,LEDA,"The while their masters worshipped, offering"
218,LEDA,"Huge teeth of ivory, while some would bring"
219,LEDA,"Their Ethiop wives—sleek wineskins of black silk,"
220,LEDA,Jellied and huge from drinking asses’ milk
221,LEDA,"Through years of tropical idleness, to pray"
222,LEDA,For offspring (whom he ever sent away
223,LEDA,"With prayers unanswered, lest their ebon race"
224,LEDA,Might breed and blacken the earth’s comely face).
225,LEDA,"Noon pressed on him a hotter, heavier weight."
226,LEDA,O Love in Idleness! how celibate
227,LEDA,He felt! Libido like a nemesis
228,LEDA,Scourged him with itching memories of bliss.
229,LEDA,The satin of imagined skin was sleek
230,LEDA,"And supply warm against his lips and cheek,"
231,LEDA,And deep within soft hair’s dishevelled dusk
232,LEDA,His eyelids fluttered; like a flowery musk
233,LEDA,The scent of a young body seemed to float
234,LEDA,"Faintly about him, close and yet remote—"
235,LEDA,For perfume and the essence of music dwell
236,LEDA,In other worlds among the asphodel
237,LEDA,Of unembodied life. Then all had flown;
238,LEDA,"His dream had melted. In his bed, alone,"
239,LEDA,"Jove sweating lay and moaned, and longed in vain"
240,LEDA,To still the pulses of his burning pain.
241,LEDA,"In sheer despair at last he leapt from bed,"
242,LEDA,Opened the window and thrust forth his head
243,LEDA,Into Olympian ether. One fierce frown
244,LEDA,"Rifted the clouds, and he was looking down"
245,LEDA,Into a gulf of azure calm; the rack
246,LEDA,"Seethed round about, tempestuously black;"
247,LEDA,But the god’s eye could hold its angry thunders back.
248,LEDA,"There lay the world, down through the chasméd blue,"
249,LEDA,Stretched out from edge to edge unto his view;
250,LEDA,"And in the midst, bright as a summer’s day"
251,LEDA,"At breathless noon, the Mediterranean lay;"
252,LEDA,And Ocean round the world’s dim fringes tossed
253,LEDA,His glaucous waves in mist and distance lost;
254,LEDA,And Pontus and the livid Caspian Sea
255,LEDA,Stirred in their nightmare sleep uneasily.
256,LEDA,"And ’twixt the seas rolled the wide fertile land,"
257,LEDA,"Dappled with green and tracts of tawny sand,"
258,LEDA,"And rich, dark fallows and fields of flowers aglow"
259,LEDA,"And the white, changeless silences of snow;"
260,LEDA,"While here and there towns, like a living eye"
261,LEDA,"Unclosed on earth’s blind face, towards the sky"
262,LEDA,Glanced their bright conscious beauty. Yet the sight
263,LEDA,Of his fair earth gave him but small delight
264,LEDA,Now in his restlessness: its beauty could
265,LEDA,Do nought to quench the fever in his blood.
266,LEDA,Desire lends sharpness to his searching eyes;
267,LEDA,Over the world his focused passion flies
268,LEDA,Quicker than chasing sunlight on a day
269,LEDA,Of storm and golden April. Far away
270,LEDA,"He sees the tranquil rivers of the East,"
271,LEDA,"Mirrors of many a strange barbaric feast,"
272,LEDA,Where un-Hellenic dancing-girls contort
273,LEDA,"Their yellow limbs, and gibbering masks make sport"
274,LEDA,Under the moons of many-coloured light
275,LEDA,That swing their lantern-fruitage in the night
276,LEDA,Of overarching trees. To him it seems
277,LEDA,"An alien world, peopled by insane dreams."
278,LEDA,But these are nothing to the monstrous shapes—
279,LEDA,Not men so much as bastardy of apes—
280,LEDA,That meet his eyes in Africa. Between
281,LEDA,"Leaves of grey fungoid pulp and poisonous green,"
282,LEDA,White eyes from black and browless faces stare.
283,LEDA,Dryads with star-flowers in their woolly hair
284,LEDA,Dance to the flaccid clapping of their own
285,LEDA,"Black dangling dugs through forests overgrown,"
286,LEDA,"Platted with writhing creepers. Horrified,"
287,LEDA,"He sees them how they leap and dance, or glide,"
288,LEDA,"Glimpse after black glimpse of a satin skin,"
289,LEDA,"Among unthinkable flowers, to pause and grin"
290,LEDA,"Out through a trellis of suppurating lips,"
291,LEDA,Of mottled tentacles barbed at the tips
292,LEDA,And bloated hands and wattles and red lobes
293,LEDA,Of pendulous gristle and enormous probes
294,LEDA,Of pink and slashed and tasselled flesh . . .
295,LEDA,He turns
296,LEDA,Northward his sickened sight. The desert burns
297,LEDA,All life away. Here in the forkéd shade
298,LEDA,"Of twin-humped towering dromedaries laid,"
299,LEDA,A few gaunt folk are sleeping: fierce they seem
300,LEDA,"Even in sleep, and restless as they dream."
301,LEDA,He would be fearful of a desert bride
302,LEDA,"As of a brown asp at his sleeping side,"
303,LEDA,Fearful of her white teeth and cunning arts.
304,LEDA,"Further, yet further, to the ultimate parts"
305,LEDA,"Of the wide earth he looks, where Britons go"
306,LEDA,"Painted among their swamps, and through the snow"
307,LEDA,Huge hairy snuffling beasts pursue their prey—
308,LEDA,"Fierce men, as hairy and as huge as they."
309,LEDA,
310,LEDA,Bewildered furrows deepen the Thunderer’s scowl;
311,LEDA,"This world so vast, so variously foul—"
312,LEDA,Who can have made its ugliness? In what
313,LEDA,Revolting fancy were the Forms begot
314,LEDA,Of all these monsters? What strange deity—
315,LEDA,So barbarously not a Greek!—was he
316,LEDA,Who could mismake such beings in his own
317,LEDA,"Distorted image. Nay, the Greeks alone"
318,LEDA,"Were men; in Greece alone were bodies fair,"
319,LEDA,"Minds comely. In that all-but-island there,"
320,LEDA,"Cleaving the blue sea with its promontories,"
321,LEDA,"Lies the world’s hope, the seed of all the glories"
322,LEDA,"That are to be; there, too, must surely live"
323,LEDA,She who alone can medicinably give
324,LEDA,Ease with her beauty to the Thunderer’s pain.
325,LEDA,"Downwards he bends his fiery eyes again,"
326,LEDA,"Glaring on Hellas. Like a beam of light,"
327,LEDA,His intent glances touch the mountain height
328,LEDA,"With passing flame and probe the valleys deep,"
329,LEDA,Rift the dense forest and the age-old sleep
330,LEDA,Of vaulted antres on whose pebbly floor
331,LEDA,Gallop the loud-hoofed Centaurs; and the roar
332,LEDA,Of more than human shouting underground
333,LEDA,Pulses in living palpable waves of sound
334,LEDA,"From wall to wall, until it rumbles out"
335,LEDA,Into the air; and at that hollow shout
336,LEDA,"That seems an utterance of the whole vast hill,"
337,LEDA,The shepherds cease their laughter and are still.
338,LEDA,Cities asleep under the noonday sky
339,LEDA,Stir at the passage of his burning eye;
340,LEDA,And in their huts the startled peasants blink
341,LEDA,At the swift flash that bursts through every chink
342,LEDA,"Of wattled walls, hearkening in fearful wonder"
343,LEDA,Through lengthened seconds for the crash of thunder—
344,LEDA,Which follows not: they are the more afraid.
345,LEDA,"Jove seeks amain. Many a country maid,"
346,LEDA,Whose sandalled feet pass down familiar ways
347,LEDA,"Among the olives, but whose spirit strays"
348,LEDA,"Through lovelier lands of fancy, suddenly"
349,LEDA,Starts broad awake out of her dream to see
350,LEDA,"A light that is not of the sun, a light"
351,LEDA,"Darted by living eyes, consciously bright;"
352,LEDA,She sees and feels it like a subtle flame
353,LEDA,Mantling her limbs with fear and maiden shame
354,LEDA,"And strange desire. Longing and terrified,"
355,LEDA,"She hides her face, like a new-wedded bride"
356,LEDA,Who feels rough hands that seize and hold her fast;
357,LEDA,And swooning falls. The terrible light has passed;
358,LEDA,"She wakes; the sun still shines, the olive trees"
359,LEDA,Tremble to whispering silver in the breeze
360,LEDA,"And all is as it was, save she alone"
361,LEDA,In whose dazed eyes this deathless light has shone:
362,LEDA,"For never, never from this day forth will she"
363,LEDA,"In earth’s poor passion find felicity,"
364,LEDA,Or love of mortal man. A god’s desire
365,LEDA,Has seared her soul; nought but the same strong fire
366,LEDA,"Can kindle the dead ash to life again,"
367,LEDA,And all her years will be a lonely pain.
368,LEDA,
369,LEDA,"Many a thousand had he looked upon,"
370,LEDA,"Thousands of mortals, young and old; but none—"
371,LEDA,"Virgin, or young ephebus, or the flower"
372,LEDA,Of womanhood culled in its full-blown hour—
373,LEDA,Could please the Thunderer’s sight or touch his mind;
374,LEDA,The longed-for loveliness was yet to find.
375,LEDA,"Had beauty fled, and was there nothing fair"
376,LEDA,Under the moon? The fury of despair
377,LEDA,Raged in the breast of heaven’s Almighty Lord;
378,LEDA,He gnashed his foamy teeth and rolled and roared
379,LEDA,In bull-like agony. Then a great calm
380,LEDA,Descended on him: cool and healing balm
381,LEDA,Touched his immortal fury. He had spied
382,LEDA,"Young Leda where she stood, poised on the river-side."
383,LEDA,
384,LEDA,"Even as she broke the river’s smooth expanse,"
385,LEDA,"Leda was conscious of that hungry glance,"
386,LEDA,And knew it for an eye of fearful power
387,LEDA,"That did so hot and thunderously lour,"
388,LEDA,"She knew not whence, on her frail nakedness."
389,LEDA,Jove’s heart held but one thought: he must possess
390,LEDA,That perfect form or die—possess or die.
391,LEDA,"Unheeded prayers and supplications fly,"
392,LEDA,"Thick as a flock of birds, about his ears,"
393,LEDA,And smoke of incense rises; but he hears
394,LEDA,Nought but the soft falls of that melody
395,LEDA,Which is the speech of Leda; he can see
396,LEDA,Nought but that almost spiritual grace
397,LEDA,"Which is her body, and that heavenly face"
398,LEDA,"Where gay, sweet thoughts shine through, and eyes are bright"
399,LEDA,With purity and the soul’s inward light.
400,LEDA,Have her he must: the teasel-fingered burr
401,LEDA,Sticks not so fast in a wild beast’s tangled fur
402,LEDA,As that insistent longing in the soul
403,LEDA,"Of mighty Jove. Gods, men, earth, heaven, the whole"
404,LEDA,Vast universe was blotted from his thought
405,LEDA,"And nought remained but Leda’s laughter, nought"
406,LEDA,"But Leda’s eyes. Magnified by his lust,"
407,LEDA,"She was the whole world now; have her he must, he must . . ."
408,LEDA,His spirit worked; how should he gain his end
409,LEDA,"With most deliciousness? What better friend,"
410,LEDA,What counsellor more subtle could he find
411,LEDA,"Than lovely Aphrodite, ever kind"
412,LEDA,"To hapless lovers, ever cunning, too,"
413,LEDA,In all the tortuous ways of love to do
414,LEDA,And plan the best? To Paphos then! His will
415,LEDA,"And act were one; and straight, invisible,"
416,LEDA,"He stood in Paphos, breathing the languid air"
417,LEDA,By Aphrodite’s couch. O heavenly fair
418,LEDA,"She was, and smooth and marvellously young!"
419,LEDA,"On Tyrian silk she lay, and purple hung"
420,LEDA,About her bed in folds of fluted light
421,LEDA,"And shadow, dark as wine. Two doves, more white"
422,LEDA,Even than the white hand on the purple lying
423,LEDA,"Like a pale flower wearily dropped, were flying"
424,LEDA,"With wings that made an odoriferous stir,"
425,LEDA,"Dropping faint dews of bakkaris and myrrh,"
426,LEDA,Musk and the soul of sweet flowers cunningly
427,LEDA,Ravished from transient petals as they die.
428,LEDA,Two stripling cupids on her either hand
429,LEDA,Stood near with winnowing plumes and gently fanned
430,LEDA,"Her hot, love-fevered cheeks and eyelids burning."
431,LEDA,"Another, crouched at the bed’s foot, was turning"
432,LEDA,A mass of scattered parchments—vows or plaints
433,LEDA,"Or glad triumphant thanks which Venus’ saints,"
434,LEDA,"Martyrs and heroes, on her altars strewed"
435,LEDA,With bitterest tears or gifts of gratitude.
436,LEDA,From the pile heaped at Aphrodite’s feet
437,LEDA,"The boy would take a leaf, and in his sweet,"
438,LEDA,Clear voice would read what mortal tongues can tell
439,LEDA,In stammering verse of those ineffable
440,LEDA,"Pleasures and pains of love, heaven and uttermost hell."
441,LEDA,Jove hidden stood and heard him read these lines
442,LEDA,Of votive thanks—
443,LEDA,"Cypris, this little silver lamp to thee"
444,LEDA,I dedicate.
445,LEDA,"It was my fellow-watcher, shared with me"
446,LEDA,"Those swift, short hours, when raised above my fate"
447,LEDA,In Sphenura’s white arms I drank
448,LEDA,Of immortality.
449,LEDA,"“A pretty lamp, and I will have it placed"
450,LEDA,Beside the narrow bed of some too chaste
451,LEDA,"Sister of virgin Artemis, to be"
452,LEDA,A night-long witness of her cruelty.
453,LEDA,"Read me another, boy,” and Venus bent"
454,LEDA,Her ear to listen to this short lament.
455,LEDA,"Cypris, Cypris, I am betrayed!"
456,LEDA,Under the same wide mantle laid
457,LEDA,"I found them, faithless, shameless pair!"
458,LEDA,Making love with tangled hair.
459,LEDA,"“Alas,” the goddess cried, “nor god, nor man,"
460,LEDA,"Nor medicinable balm, nor magic can"
461,LEDA,"Cast out the demon jealousy, whose breath"
462,LEDA,"Withers the rose of life, save only time and death.”"
463,LEDA,Another sheet he took and read again.
464,LEDA,"Farewell to love, and hail the long, slow pain"
465,LEDA,Of memory that backward turns to joy.
466,LEDA,O I have danced enough and enough sung;
467,LEDA,My feet shall be still now and my voice mute;
468,LEDA,"Thine are these withered wreaths, this Lydian flute,"
469,LEDA,Cypris; I once was young.
470,LEDA,And piêtous Aphrodite wept to think
471,LEDA,How fadingly upon death’s very brink
472,LEDA,Beauty and love take hands for one short kiss—
473,LEDA,"And then the wreaths are dust, the bright-eyed bliss"
474,LEDA,"Perished, and the flute still. “Read on, read on.”"
475,LEDA,"But ere the page could start, a lightning shone"
476,LEDA,"Suddenly through the room, and they were ’ware"
477,LEDA,Of some great terrible presence looming there.
478,LEDA,"And it took shape—huge limbs, whose every line"
479,LEDA,"A symbol was of power and strength divine,"
480,LEDA,And it was Jove.
481,LEDA,"“Daughter, I come,” said he,"
482,LEDA,“For counsel in a case that touches me
483,LEDA,"Close, to the very life.” And he straightway"
484,LEDA,Told her of all his restlessness that day
485,LEDA,"And of his sight of Leda, and how great"
486,LEDA,Was his desire. And so in close debate
487,LEDA,"Sat the two gods, planning their rape; while she,"
488,LEDA,"Who was to be their victim, joyously"
489,LEDA,Laughed like a child in the sudden breathless chill
490,LEDA,"And splashed and swam, forgetting every ill"
491,LEDA,"And every fear and all, save only this:"
492,LEDA,"That she was young, and it was perfect bliss"
493,LEDA,"To be alive where suns so goldenly shine,"
494,LEDA,"And bees go drunk with fragrant honey-wine,"
495,LEDA,"And the cicadas sing from morn till night,"
496,LEDA,And rivers run so cool and pure and bright . . .
497,LEDA,"Stretched all her length, arms under head, she lay"
498,LEDA,"In the deep grass, while the sun kissed away"
499,LEDA,The drops that sleeked her skin. Slender and fine
500,LEDA,As those old images of the gods that shine
501,LEDA,"With smooth-worn silver, polished through the years"
502,LEDA,"By the touching lips of countless worshippers,"
503,LEDA,Her body was; and the sun’s golden heat
504,LEDA,Clothed her in softest flame from head to feet
505,LEDA,"And was her mantle, that she scarcely knew"
506,LEDA,"The conscious sense of nakedness. The blue,"
507,LEDA,Far hills and the faint fringes of the sky
508,LEDA,"Shimmered and pulsed in the heat uneasily,"
509,LEDA,"And hidden in the grass, cicadas shrill"
510,LEDA,"Dizzied the air with ceaseless noise, until"
511,LEDA,A listener might wonder if they cried
512,LEDA,In his own head or in the world outside.
513,LEDA,"Sometimes she shut her eyelids, and wrapped round"
514,LEDA,"In a red darkness, with the muffled sound"
515,LEDA,"And throb of blood beating within her brain,"
516,LEDA,Savoured intensely to the verge of pain
517,LEDA,"Her own young life, hoarded it up behind"
518,LEDA,"Her shuttered lids, until, too long confined,"
519,LEDA,It burst them open and her prisoned soul
520,LEDA,Flew forth and took possession of the whole
521,LEDA,Exquisite world about her and was made
522,LEDA,"A part of it. Meanwhile her maidens played,"
523,LEDA,"Singing an ancient song of death and birth,"
524,LEDA,"Seed-time and harvest, old as the grey earth,"
525,LEDA,And moving to their music in a dance
526,LEDA,As immemorial. A numbing trance
527,LEDA,"Came gradually over her, as though"
528,LEDA,Flake after downy-feathered flake of snow
529,LEDA,"Had muffled all her senses, drifting deep"
530,LEDA,And warm and quiet.
531,LEDA,
532,LEDA,From this all-but sleep
533,LEDA,She started into life again; the sky
534,LEDA,Was full of a strange tumult suddenly—
535,LEDA,Beating of mighty wings and shrill-voiced fear
536,LEDA,And the hoarse scream of rapine following near.
537,LEDA,"In the high windlessness above her flew,"
538,LEDA,"Dazzlingly white on the untroubled blue,"
539,LEDA,"A splendid swan, with outstretched neck and wing"
540,LEDA,"Spread fathom wide, and closely following"
541,LEDA,"An eagle, tawny and black. This god-like pair"
542,LEDA,"Circled and swooped through the calm of upper air,"
543,LEDA,The eagle striking and the white swan still
544,LEDA,’Scaping as though by happy miracle
545,LEDA,The imminent talons. For the twentieth time
546,LEDA,"The furious hunter stooped, to miss and climb"
547,LEDA,A mounting spiral into the height again.
548,LEDA,"He hung there poised, eyeing the grassy plain"
549,LEDA,"Far, far beneath, where the girls’ upturned faces"
550,LEDA,Were like white flowers that bloom in open places
551,LEDA,Among the scarcely budded woods. And they
552,LEDA,"Breathlessly watched and waited; long he lay,"
553,LEDA,"Becalmed upon that tideless sea of light,"
554,LEDA,While the great swan with slow and creaking flight
555,LEDA,"Went slanting down towards safety, where the stream"
556,LEDA,"Shines through the trees below, with glance and gleam"
557,LEDA,Of blue aerial eyes that seem to give
558,LEDA,Sense to the sightless earth and make it live.
559,LEDA,The ponderous wings beat on and no pursuit:
560,LEDA,"Stiff as the painted kite that guards the fruit,"
561,LEDA,"Afloat o’er orchards ripe, the eagle yet"
562,LEDA,"Hung as at anchor, seeming to forget"
563,LEDA,"His uncaught prey, his rage unsatisfied."
564,LEDA,"Still, quiet, dead . . . and then the quickest-eyed"
565,LEDA,"Had lost him. Like a star unsphered, a stone"
566,LEDA,"Dropped from the vault of heaven, a javelin thrown,"
567,LEDA,"He swooped upon his prey. Down, down he came,"
568,LEDA,And through his plumes with a noise of wind-blown flame
569,LEDA,Loud roared the air. From Leda’s lips a cry
570,LEDA,"Broke, and she hid her face—she could not see him die,"
571,LEDA,"Her lovely, hapless swan."
572,LEDA,"Ah, had she heard,"
573,LEDA,"Even as the eagle hurtled past, the word"
574,LEDA,"That treacherous pair exchanged. “Peace,” cried the swan;"
575,LEDA,"“Peace, daughter. All my strength will soon be gone,"
576,LEDA,"Wasted in tedious flying, ere I come"
577,LEDA,Where my desire hath set its only home.”
578,LEDA,"“Go,” said the eagle, “I have played my part,"
579,LEDA,Roused pity for your plight in Leda’s heart
580,LEDA,(Pity the mother of voluptuousness).
581,LEDA,"Go, father Jove; be happy; for success"
582,LEDA,Attends this moment.”
583,LEDA,On the queen’s numbed sense
584,LEDA,"Fell a glad shout that ended sick suspense,"
585,LEDA,Bidding her lift once more towards the light
586,LEDA,"Her eyes, by pity closed against a sight"
587,LEDA,"Of blood and death—her eyes, how happy now"
588,LEDA,"To see the swan still safe, while far below,"
589,LEDA,Brought by the force of his eluded stroke
590,LEDA,So near to earth that with his wings he woke
591,LEDA,A gust whose sudden silvery motion stirred
592,LEDA,"The meadow grass, struggled the sombre bird"
593,LEDA,Of rage and rapine. Loud his scream and hoarse
594,LEDA,With baffled fury as he urged his course
595,LEDA,Upwards again on threshing pinions wide.
596,LEDA,"But the fair swan, not daring to abide"
597,LEDA,"This last assault, dropped with the speed of fear"
598,LEDA,"Towards the river. Like a winged spear,"
599,LEDA,"Outstretching his long neck, rigid and straight,"
600,LEDA,Aimed at where Leda on the bank did wait
601,LEDA,"With open arms and kind, uplifted eyes"
602,LEDA,"And voice of tender pity, down he flies."
603,LEDA,"Nearer, nearer, terribly swift, he sped"
604,LEDA,Directly at the queen; then widely spread
605,LEDA,"Resisting wings, and breaking his descent"
606,LEDA,"’Gainst his own wind, all speed and fury spent,"
607,LEDA,The great swan fluttered slowly down to rest
608,LEDA,And sweet security on Leda’s breast.
609,LEDA,Menacingly the eagle wheeled above her;
610,LEDA,"But Leda, like a noble-hearted lover"
611,LEDA,"Keeping his child-beloved from tyrannous harm,"
612,LEDA,"Stood o’er the swan and, with one slender arm"
613,LEDA,"Imperiously lifted, waved away"
614,LEDA,"The savage foe, still hungry for his prey."
615,LEDA,"Baffled at last, he mounted out of sight"
616,LEDA,And the sky was void—save for a single white
617,LEDA,Swan’s feather moulted from a harassed wing
618,LEDA,"That down, down, with a rhythmic balancing"
619,LEDA,From side to side dropped sleeping on the air.
620,LEDA,"Down, slowly down over that dazzling pair,"
621,LEDA,Whose different grace in union was a birth
622,LEDA,Of unimagined beauty on the earth:
623,LEDA,So lovely that the maidens standing round
624,LEDA,Dared scarcely look. Couched on the flowery ground
625,LEDA,"Young Leda lay, and to her side did press"
626,LEDA,"The swan’s proud-arching opulent loveliness,"
627,LEDA,Stroking the snow-soft plumage of his breast
628,LEDA,"With fingers slowly drawn, themselves caressed"
629,LEDA,"By the warm softness where they lingered, loth"
630,LEDA,To break away. Sometimes against their growth
631,LEDA,Ruffling the feathers inlaid like little scales
632,LEDA,"On his sleek neck, the pointed finger-nails"
633,LEDA,"Rasped on the warm, dry, puckered skin beneath;"
634,LEDA,"And feeling it she shuddered, and her teeth"
635,LEDA,Grated on edge; for there was something strange
636,LEDA,"And snake-like in the touch. He, in exchange,"
637,LEDA,"Gave back to her, stretching his eager neck,"
638,LEDA,For every kiss a little amorous peck;
639,LEDA,"Rubbing his silver head on her gold tresses,"
640,LEDA,And with the nip of horny dry caresses
641,LEDA,Leaving upon her young white breast and cheek
642,LEDA,And arms the red print of his playful beak.
643,LEDA,"Closer he nestled, mingling with the slim"
644,LEDA,Austerity of virginal flank and limb
645,LEDA,"His curved and florid beauty, till she felt"
646,LEDA,That downy warmth strike through her flesh and melt
647,LEDA,The bones and marrow of her strength away.
648,LEDA,"One lifted arm bent o’er her brow, she lay"
649,LEDA,"With limbs relaxed, scarce breathing, deathly still;"
650,LEDA,"Save when a quick, involuntary thrill"
651,LEDA,"Shook her sometimes with passing shudderings,"
652,LEDA,As though some hand had plucked the aching strings
653,LEDA,"Of life itself, tense with expectancy."
654,LEDA,And over her the swan shook slowly free
655,LEDA,"The folded glory of his wings, and made"
656,LEDA,A white-walled tent of soft and luminous shade
657,LEDA,To be her veil and keep her from the shame
658,LEDA,Of naked light and the sun’s noonday flame.
659,LEDA,
660,LEDA,"Hushed lay the earth and the wide, careless sky."
661,LEDA,"Then one sharp sound, that might have been a cry"
662,LEDA,"Of utmost pleasure or of utmost pain,"
663,LEDA,"Broke sobbing forth, and all was still again."
664,LEDA,

668,THE BIRTH OF GOD,THE BIRTH OF GOD
669,THE BIRTH OF GOD,
670,THE BIRTH OF GOD,NIGHT is a void about me; I lie alone;
671,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"And water drips, like an idiot clicking his tongue,"
672,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"Senselessly, ceaselessly, endlessly drips"
673,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"Into the waiting silence, grown"
674,THE BIRTH OF GOD,Emptier for this small inhuman sound.
675,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"My love is gone, my love who is tender and young."
676,THE BIRTH OF GOD,O smooth warm body! O passionate lips!
677,THE BIRTH OF GOD,I have stretched forth hands in the dark and nothing found:
678,THE BIRTH OF GOD,The silence is huge as the sky—I lie alone—
679,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"My narrow room, a darkness that knows no bound."
680,THE BIRTH OF GOD,
681,THE BIRTH OF GOD,How shall I fill this measureless
682,THE BIRTH OF GOD,Deep void that the taking away
683,THE BIRTH OF GOD,Of a child’s slim beauty has made?
684,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"Slender she is and small, but the loneliness"
685,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"She has left is a night no stars allay,"
686,THE BIRTH OF GOD,And I am cold and afraid.
687,THE BIRTH OF GOD,
688,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"Long, long ago, cut off from the wolfish pack,"
689,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"From the warm, immediate touch of friends and mate,"
690,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"Lost and alone, alone in the utter black"
691,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"Of a forest night, some far-off, beast-like man,"
692,THE BIRTH OF GOD,Cowed by the cold indifferent hate
693,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"Of the northern silence, crouched in fear,"
694,THE BIRTH OF GOD,When through his bleared and suffering mind
695,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"A sudden tremor of comfort ran,"
696,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"And the void was filled by a rushing wind,"
697,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"And he breathed a sense of something friendly and near,"
698,THE BIRTH OF GOD,And in privation the life of God began.
699,THE BIRTH OF GOD,
700,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"Love, from your loss shall a god be born to fill"
701,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"The emptiness, where once you were,"
702,THE BIRTH OF GOD,With friendly knowledge and more than a lover’s will
703,THE BIRTH OF GOD,To ease despair?
704,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"Shall I feed longing with what it hungers after,"
705,THE BIRTH OF GOD,Seeing in earth and sea and air
706,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"A lover’s smiles, hearing a lover’s laughter,"
707,THE BIRTH OF GOD,Feeling love everywhere?
708,THE BIRTH OF GOD,
709,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"The night drags on. Darkness and silence grow,"
710,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"And with them my desire has grown,"
711,THE BIRTH OF GOD,"My bitter need. Alas, I know,"
712,THE BIRTH OF GOD,I know that here I lie alone.

721,ON HAMPSTEAD HEATH,"Shine through the gauzy air in a dust of golden pollen,"
722,ON HAMPSTEAD HEATH,And even the glittering leaves are almost still.
723,ON HAMPSTEAD HEATH,

742,SYMPATHY,Grave and unquiet in tenderness.
743,SYMPATHY,Heart-rending question of women—never answered:
744,SYMPATHY,"“Tell me, tell me, what are you thinking of?”"

1463,VIII,On the banks of ancient rivers stand the pitiful stumps of huge towers
1464,VIII,and the ghosts of dead men straining to return into life. The woods are
1465,VIII,"full of the smell of transience. Beauty, then, is that moment of descent"
1466,VIII,when apotheosis tilts its wings downwards into the gulf. The ends of the

1481,VIII,Night is a measureless deep silence: daybreak brings back the fœtid
1482,VIII,gutters of the town. O supreme beauty of a night that knows no
1483,VIII,"limitations—stars or the jagged edges of cock-crowing. Desperate, my"

1487,VIII,"At the other extreme, Beatrice lacks solidity, is as unresponsive to"

1491,VIII,
1492,VIII,"What, then, is the common measure? To take the world as it is, but"

1496,VIII,"When flowers are thoughts, and lonely poplars fountains of aspiring"
1497,VIII,longing; when our actions are the poem of which all geographies and
1498,VIII,architectures and every science and all the unclassed individual odds
1499,VIII,"and ends are the words, when even Helen’s white voluptuousness matches"
1500,VIII,"some candour of the soul—then it will have been found, the permanent"
1501,VIII,and living loveliness.
1502,VIII,
1503,VIII,"It is not a far-fetched, dear-bought gem; no pomander to be smelt only"

1506,VIII,"permission at a nominal charge, not a thing richly apart, but an ethic,"
1507,VIII,"a way of belief and of practice, of faith and works, mediæval in its"
1508,VIII,implication with the very threads of life. I desire no Paphian cloister
1509,VIII,"of pink monks. Rather a rosy Brotherhood of Common Life, eating,"
1510,VIII,drinking; marrying and giving in marriage; taking and taken in adultery;
1511,VIII,"reading, thinking, and when thinking fails, feeling immeasurably more"

1513,VIII,
1514,VIII,"Arduous search for one who is chained by his desires to dead carcases,"
1515,VIII,whose eyes are dimmed with tears by the slow heart-breaking twilights
1516,VIII,"full of old family ghosts laid in lavender, whose despair cries out for"

1530,FOREWORD,"JOHN RIDLEY, the subject of this poem, was killed in February 1918."
1531,FOREWORD,"“If I should perish,” he wrote to me only five weeks before his death,"
1532,FOREWORD,“if I should perish—and one isn’t exactly a ’good life’ at the
1533,FOREWORD,moment—I wish you’d write something about me. It isn’t vanity (for I
1534,FOREWORD,"know you’ll do me, if anything, rather less than justice!), not vanity,"
1535,FOREWORD,I repeat; but that queer irrational desire one has for immortality of
1536,FOREWORD,"any kind, however short and precarious—for frankly, my dear, I doubt"
1537,FOREWORD,whether your verses will be so very much more perennial than brass.
1538,FOREWORD,"Still, they’ll be something. One can’t, of course, believe in any"
1539,FOREWORD,_au-delà_ for one’s personal self; one would have first to believe in
1540,FOREWORD,"some kind of a friendly god. And as for being a spiritualist spook, one"
1541,FOREWORD,of those wretched beings who seem to spend their eternity in trying to
1542,FOREWORD,"communicate with the earth by a single telephone, where the number is"
1543,FOREWORD,"always engaged, and the line chronically out of order—well, all I can"
1544,FOREWORD,"say is, Heaven preserve me from such a future life. No, my only hope is"
1545,FOREWORD,you—and a damned poor guarantee for eternity. Don’t make of me a khaki

1550,FOREWORD,
1551,FOREWORD,The following poem is a tentative and provisional attempt to comply with
1552,FOREWORD,"his request. Ridley was an adolescent, and suffered from that"
1553,FOREWORD,instability of mind “produced by the mental conflict forced upon man by
1554,FOREWORD,his sensitiveness to herd suggestion on the one hand and to experience
1555,FOREWORD,on the other” (I quote from Mr. Trotter’s memorable work on Herd
1556,FOREWORD,"Instinct), that characteristic instability which makes adolescence so"

1558,FOREWORD,up a single day from Ridley’s forgotten existence. It has a bedraggled

1560,FOREWORD,"however, it will soon be allowed to drop back into the water, where we"
1561,FOREWORD,"shall all, in due course, join it. “The greater part must be content to"

1566,FOREWORD,
1567,I,I
1568,I,BETWEEN the drawing of the blind
1569,I,And being aware of yet another day
1570,I,There came to him behind
1571,I,"Close, pregnant eyelids, like a flame of blue,"
1572,I,"Intense, untroubled by the wind,"
1573,I,"A Mediterranean bay,"
1574,I,Bearing a brazen beak and foamless oars
1575,I,"To where, marmoreally smooth and bright,"
1576,I,The steps soar up in one pure flight
1577,I,"From the sea’s edge to the palace doors,"
1578,I,"That have shut, have shut their valves of bronze—"
1579,I,And the windows too are lifeless eyes.
1580,I,
1581,I,The galley grated on the stone;
1582,I,He stepped out—and was alone:
1583,I,"No white-sailed hopes, no clouds, nor swans"
1584,I,"To shatter the ocean’s calm, to break the sky’s."
1585,I,
1586,I,Up the slow stairs:
1587,I,Did he know it was a dream?
1588,I,"First one foot up, then the other foot,"
1589,I,Shuddering like a mandrake root
1590,I,That hears the truffle-dog at work
1591,I,And draws a breath to scream;
1592,I,"To moan, to scream."
1593,I,"The gates swing wide,"
1594,I,"And it is coolly dark inside,"
1595,I,"And corridors stretch out and out,"
1596,I,"Joining the ceilings to their floors,"
1597,I,And parallels ring wedding bells
1598,I,And through a hundred thousand doors
1599,I,Perspective has abolished doubt.
1600,I,
1601,I,"But one of the doors was shut,"
1602,I,And behind it the subtlest lutanist
1603,I,"Was shaking a broken necklace of tinkling notes,"
1604,I,And somehow it was feminine music.
1605,I,"Strange exultant fear of desire, when hearts"
1606,I,Beat brokenly. He laid his hand on the latch—
1607,I,And woke among his familiar books and pictures;
1608,I,
1609,I,Real as his dream? He wondered. Ten to nine.
1610,I,Thursday. Wasn’t he lunching at his aunt’s?
1611,I,Distressing circumstance.
1612,I,"But then he was taking Jenny out to dine,"
1613,I,Which was some consolation. What a chin!
1614,I,"Civilized ten thousand years, and still"
1615,I,No better way than rasping a pale mask
1616,I,"With imminent suicide, steel or obsidian:"
1617,I,Repulsive task!
1618,I,And the more odious for being quotidian.
1619,I,If one should live till eighty-five . . .
1620,I,"And the dead, do they still shave? The horrible dead, are they alive?"
1621,I,
1622,I,"But that lute, playing across his dream . . ."
1623,I,"Quick drops breaking the sleep of the water-wheel,"
1624,I,"Song and ebbing whisper of a summer stream,"
1625,I,Music’s endless inconsequence that would reveal
1626,I,"To souls that listened for it, the all"
1627,I,"Unseizable confidence, the mystic Rose,"
1628,I,Could it but find the magical fall
1629,I,"That droops, droops and dies into the perfect close . . ."
1630,I,And why so feminine? But one could feel
1631,I,The unseen woman sitting there behind
1632,I,"The door, making her ceaseless slow appeal"
1633,I,To all that prowls and growls in the caves beneath
1634,I,The libraries and parlours of the mind.
1635,I,"If only one were rational, if only"
1636,I,At least one had the illusion of being so . . .
1637,I,
1638,I,"Nine o’clock. Still in bed. Warm, but how lonely!"
1639,I,"He wept to think of all those single beds,"
1640,I,"Those desperate night-long solitudes,"
1641,I,Those mental Salons full of nudes.
1642,I,Shelley was great when he was twenty-four.
1643,I,"Eight thousand nights alone—minus, perhaps,"
1644,I,"Six, or no! seven, certainly not more."
1645,I,Five little bits of heaven
1646,I,"(Tum-de-rum, de-rum, de-rum),"
1647,I,"Five little bits of Heaven and one that was a lapse,"
1648,I,High-priced disgust: it stopped him suddenly
1649,I,In the midst of laughter and talk with a tingling down the
1650,I,"(Like infants’ impoliteness, a terrible infant’s brightness),"
1651,I,And he would shut his eyes so as not to see
1652,I,His own hot blushes calling him a swine.
1653,I,Atrocious memory! For memory should be
1654,I,"Of things secure and dead, being past,"
1655,I,Not living and disquieting. At last
1656,I,He threw the nightmare of his blankets off.
1657,I,
1658,I,"Cloudy ammonia, camels in your bath:"
1659,I,The earth hath bubbles as the water hath:
1660,I,"He was not of them, too, too solidly"
1661,I,"Always himself. What foam of kissing lips,"
1662,I,"Pouting, parting with the ghost of the seven sips"
1663,I,One smacks for hiccoughs!
1664,I,Pitiable to be
1665,I,Quite so deplorably naked when one strips.
1666,I,
1667,I,"There was his scar, a panel of old rose"
1668,I,Slashed in the elegant buff of his trunk hose;
1669,I,"Adonis punctured by his amorous boar,"
1670,I,Permanent souvenir of the Great War.
1671,I,"One of God’s jokes, typically good,"
1672,I,That wound of his. How perfect that he should
1673,I,Have suffered it for—what?
1674,I,
1675,I,
1676,I,
1677,I,
1678,II,II
1679,II,"OH, the dear front page of the _Times_!"
1680,II,Chronicle of essential history:
1681,II,"Marriage, birth, and the sly mysteriousness"
1682,II,"Of lovers’ greetings, of lovers’ meetings,"
1683,II,"And dirty death, impartially paid"
1684,II,To courage and the old decayed.
1685,II,"But nobody had been born to-day,"
1686,II,"Nobody married that he knew,"
1687,II,Nobody died and nobody even killed;
1688,II,He felt a little aggrieved—
1689,II,Nobody even killed.
1690,II,"But, to make up: “Tuesday, Colchester train:"
1691,II,"Wanted Brown Eyes’ address, with a view to meeting again.”"
1692,II,"Dear Brown Eyes, it had been nice of her"
1693,II,To talk so friendly to a lonely traveller!
1694,II,Why is it nobody ever talks to me?
1695,II,
1696,II,"And now, here was a letter from Helen."
1697,II,Better to open it rather than thus
1698,II,Dwell in a long muse and maze
1699,II,"Over the scrawled address and the postmark,"
1700,II,Staring stupidly.
1701,II,Love—was there no escape?
1702,II,"Was it always there, always there?"
1703,II,"The same huge and dominant shape,"
1704,II,Like Windsor Castle leaning over the plain;
1705,II,"And the letter a vista cut through the musing forest,"
1706,II,"At the end the old Round Tower,"
1707,II,Singing its refrain:
1708,II,"Here we are, here we are, here we are again!"
1709,II,
1710,II,"The life so short, so vast love’s science and art,"
1711,II,So many conditions of felicity.
1712,II,"“Darling, will you become a part"
1713,II,Of my poor physiology?
1714,II,"And, my beloved, may I have"
1715,II,The latchkey of your history?
1716,II,And while this corpse is what it is
1717,II,"Dear, we must share geographies.”"
1718,II,So many conditions of felicity.
1719,II,"And now time was a widening gulf and space,"
1720,II,"A fixed between, and fate still kept them apart."
1721,II,Her voice quite gone; distance had blurred her face.
1722,II,"The life so short, so vast love’s science and art."
1723,II,
1724,II,"So many conditions—and yet, once,"
1725,II,"Four whole days,"
1726,II,"Four short days of perishing time,"
1727,II,They had fulfilled them all.
1728,II,"But that was long ago, ah! long ago,"
1729,II,"Like the last horse bus, or the Christmas pantomime,"
1730,II,"Or the Bells, oh, the Bells, of Edgar Allan Poe."
1731,II,
1732,II,
1733,II,

1735,III,III
1736,III,"“HELEN, your letter, proving, I suppose,"
1737,III,"That you exist somewhere in space, who knows?"
1738,III,"Somewhere in time, perhaps, arrives this morning,"
1739,III,Reminding me with a note of Lutheran warning
1740,III,"That faith’s the test, not works. Works!—any fool"
1741,III,Can do them if he tries to; but what school
1742,III,"Can teach one to credit the ridiculous,"
1743,III,"The palpably non-existent? So with us,"
1744,III,"Votaries of the copulative cult,"
1745,III,"In this affair of love, _quicumque vult_,"
1746,III,"Whoever would be saved, must love without"
1747,III,"Adjunct of sense or reason, must not doubt"
1748,III,"Although the deity be far removed,"
1749,III,"Remote, invisible; who is not loved"
1750,III,"Best by voluptuous works, but by the faith"
1751,III,That lives in absence and the body’s death.
1752,III,"I have no faith, and even in love remain"
1753,III,"Agnostic. Are you here? The fact is plain,"
1754,III,"Constated by the heavenly vision of you,"
1755,III,"Maybe by the mouth’s warm touch; and that I love you,"
1756,III,"I then most surely know, most painfully."
1757,III,"But now you’ve robbed the temple, leaving me"
1758,III,"A poor invisibility to adore,"
1759,III,"Now that, alas, you’re vanished, gone . . . no more;"
1760,III,You take my drift. I only ask your leave
1761,III,"To be a little unfaithful—not to you,"
1762,III,"My dear, to whom I was and will be true,"
1763,III,But to your absence. Hence no cause to grieve;
1764,III,For absence may be cheated of a kiss—
1765,III,Lightly and laughing—with no prejudice
1766,III,"To the so longed-for presence, which some day"
1767,III,Will crown the presence of
1768,III,Le Vostre J.
1769,III,(As dear unhappy Troilus would say).”

1774,IV,IV
1775,IV,"OH, the maggots, the maggots in his brains!"
1776,IV,"Words, words and words."
1777,IV,"A birth of rhymes and the strangest,"
1778,IV,The most unlikely superfœtations—
1779,IV,"New deep thoughts begot by a jingle upon a pun,"
1780,IV,New worlds glimpsed through the window of a word
1781,IV,"That has ceased, somehow, to be opaque."
1782,IV,All the muses buzzing in his head.
1783,IV,"Autobiography crystallised under his pen, thus:"
1784,IV,
1785,IV,"“When I was young enough not to know youth,"
1786,IV,I was a Faun whose loves were Byzantine
1787,IV,Among stiff trees. Before me naked Truth
1788,IV,"Creaked on her intellectual legs, divine"
1789,IV,"In being inhuman, and was never caught"
1790,IV,By all my speed; for she could outrun thought.
1791,IV,
1792,IV,"Now I am old enough to know I am young,"
1793,IV,"I chase more plastic beauties, but inspire"
1794,IV,"Life in their clay, purity in their dung"
1795,IV,With the creative breath of my desire.
1796,IV,And utter truth is now made manifest
1797,IV,When on a certain sleeping face and breast
1798,IV,
1799,IV,"The moonlight dreams and silver chords are strung,"
1800,IV,And a god’s hand touches the aching lyre.”
1801,IV,"He read it through: a pretty, clinquant thing,"
1802,IV,"Like bright spontaneous bird-song in the spring,"
1803,IV,"Instinct with instinct, full of dewy freshness."
1804,IV,"Yes, he had genius, if he chose to use it;"
1805,IV,"If he chose to—but it was too much trouble,"
1806,IV,"And he preferred reading. He lit his pipe,"
1807,IV,"Opened his book, plunged in and soon was drowned"
1808,IV,In pleasant seas . . . to rise again and find
1809,IV,One o’clock struck and his unshaven face
1810,IV,"Still like a record in a musical box,"
1811,IV,And Auntie Loo miles off in Bloomsbury.

1818,I.,"THE Open Sesame of “Master John,”"
1819,I.,And then the broad silk bosom of Aunt Loo.
1820,I.,"“Dear John, this is a pleasure. How are you?”"
1821,I.,"“Well, thanks. Where’s Uncle Will?” “Your uncle’s gone"
1822,I.,To Bath for his lumbago. He gets on
1823,I.,As well as anyone can hope to do
1824,I.,At his age—for you know he’s seventy-two;
1825,I.,"But still, he does his bit. He sits upon"
1826,I.,
1827,I.,"The local Tribunal at home, and takes"
1828,I.,Parties of wounded soldiers out in brakes
1829,I.,To see the country. And three times a week
1830,I.,He still goes up to business in the City;
1831,I.,"And then, sometimes, at night he has to speak"
1832,I.,In Village Halls for the War Aims Committee.”
1833,I.,
1834,II.,II.
1835,II.,"“Well, have you any news about the war?"
1836,II.,What do they say in France?” “I daren’t repeat
1837,II.,The things they say.” “You see we’ve got some meat
1838,II.,"For you, dear John. Really, I think before"
1839,II.,To-day I’ve had no lamb this year. We score
1840,II.,"By getting decent vegetables to eat,"
1841,II.,Sent up from home. This is a good receipt:
1842,II.,The touch of garlic makes it. Have some more.
1843,II.,
1844,II.,Poor Tom was wounded on the twenty-third;
1845,II.,Did you know that? And just to-day I heard
1846,II.,News from your uncle that his nephew James
1847,II.,Is dead—Matilda’s eldest boy.” “I knew
1848,II.,"One of those boys, but I’m so bad at names."
1849,II.,"Mine had red hair.” “Oh, now, that must be Hugh.”"
1850,II.,
1851,III.,III.
1852,III.,“Colonel McGillicuddy came to dine
1853,III.,"Quietly here, a night or two ago."
1854,III.,He’s on the Staff and very much in the know
1855,III.,About all sorts of things. His special line
1856,III.,Is Tanks. He says we’ve got a new design
1857,III.,"Of super-Tank, with big guns, that can go"
1858,III.,(I think he said) at thirty miles or so
1859,III.,An hour. That ought to make them whine
1860,III.,
1861,III.,"For peace. He also said, if I remember,"
1862,III.,"That the war couldn’t last beyond September,"
1863,III.,Because the Germans’ trucks were wearing out
1864,III.,And couldn’t be replaced. I only hope
1865,III.,It’s true. You know your uncle has no doubt
1866,III.,That the whole thing was plotted by the Pope . . .”
1867,III.,
1868,III.,"“. . . Good-bye, dear John. We _have_ had a nice talk."
1869,III.,"You must soon come again. Good-bye, good-bye. . . .”"
1870,III.,
1871,III.,"He tottered forth, full of the melancholy"
1872,III.,"That comes of surfeit, and began to walk"
1873,III.,Slowly towards Oxford Street. The brazen sky
1874,III.,Burned overhead. Beneath his feet the stones
1875,III.,"Were a grey incandescence, and his bones"
1876,III.,"Melted within him, and his bowels yearned."

1881,VI,VI
1882,VI,"THE crowd, the crowd—oh, he could almost cry"
1883,VI,"To see those myriad faces hurrying by,"
1884,VI,And each a strong tower rooted in the past
1885,VI,"On dark unknown foundations, each made fast"
1886,VI,"With locks nobody knew the secret of,"
1887,VI,No key could open: save that perhaps love
1888,VI,Might push the bars half back and just peep in—
1889,VI,"And see strange sights, it may be. But for him"
1890,VI,"They were locked donjons, every window bright"
1891,VI,"With beckoning mystery; and then, Good Night!"
1892,VI,"The lamp was out, they were passed, they were gone"
1893,VI,For ever . . . ever. And one might have been
1894,VI,"The hero or the friend long sought, and one"
1895,VI,"Was the loveliest face his eyes had ever seen,"
1896,VI,(Vanished as soon) and he went lonely on.
1897,VI,
1898,VI,Then in a sudden fearful vision he saw
1899,VI,The whole world spread before him—a vast sphere
1900,VI,Of seething atoms moving to one law:
1901,VI,"“Be individual. Approach, draw near,"
1902,VI,"Yes, even touch: but never join, never be"
1903,VI,Other than your own selves eternally.”
1904,VI,"And there are tangents, tangents of thought that aim"
1905,VI,Out through the gaps between the patterned stars
1906,VI,At some fantastic dream without a name
1907,VI,"That like the moon shining through prison bars,"
1908,VI,"Visits the mind with madness. So they fly,"
1909,VI,"Those soaring tangents, till the first jet tires,"
1910,VI,"Failing, faltering half-way up the sky,"
1911,VI,And breaks—poor slender fountain that aspires
1912,VI,Against the whole strength of the heavy earth
1913,VI,"Within whose womb, darkly, it took birth."
1914,VI,
1915,VI,"Oh, how remote he walked along the street,"
1916,VI,Jostling with other lumps of human meat!
1917,VI,
1918,VI,He was so tired. The café doors invite.
1919,VI,"Caverned within them, still lingers the night"
1920,VI,"In shadowy coolness, soothing the seared sight."
1921,VI,"He sat there smoking, soulless and wholly crass,"
1922,VI,Sunk to the eyes in the warm sodden morass
1923,VI,"Of his own guts, wearily, wearily"
1924,VI,Ruminating visions of mortality—
1925,VI,"Memento Moris from the pink alcove,"
1926,VI,Nightmare oppressiveness of profane love.
1927,VI,"Cesspool within, and without him he could see"
1928,VI,Nothing but mounds of flesh and harlotry.
1929,VI,"Like a half-pricked bubble pendulous in space,"
1930,VI,The buttered leatheriness of a Jew’s face
1931,VI,"Looms through cigar-smoke; red and ghastly white,"
1932,VI,Death’s-head women fascinate the sight.
1933,VI,"It was the nightmare of a corpse. Dead, dead . . ."
1934,VI,"Oh, to wake up, to live again! he fled"
1935,VI,From that foul place and from himself.
1936,VI,
1937,VI,
1938,VI,
1939,VI,
1940,VII,VII
1941,VII,"TWIN domes of the Alhambra,"
1942,VII,Veiled tenderness of the sky above the Square:
1943,VII,"He sat him down in the gardens, under the trees,"
1944,VII,"And in the dust, with the point of his umbrella,"
1945,VII,Drew pictures of the crosses we have to bear.
1946,VII,
1947,VII,"The poor may starve, the sick have horrible pains—"
1948,VII,But there are pale eyes even in the London planes.
1949,VII,
1950,VII,"Men may make war and money, mischief and love—"
1951,VII,But about us are colours and the sky above.
1952,VII,
1953,VII,"Yes, here, where the golden domes ring clear,"
1954,VII,"And the planes patiently, hopefully renew"
1955,VII,Their green refrain from year to year
1956,VII,"To the dim spring burden of London’s husky blue,"
1957,VII,Here he could see the folly of it. How?
1958,VII,Confine a boundless possible within
1959,VII,The prison of an ineluctable Now?
1960,VII,"Go slave to pain, woo forth original sin"
1961,VII,Out of her lair—and all by a foolish Act?
1962,VII,"Madness! But now, Wordsworth of Leicester Square,"
1963,VII,"He’d learnt his lesson, learnt by the mere fact"
1964,VII,"Of the place existing, so finely unaware"
1965,VII,Of syphilis and the restless in and out
1966,VII,"Of public lavatories, and evening shout"
1967,VII,"Of winners and disasters, races and war."
1968,VII,
1969,VII,Troubles come thick enough. Why call for more
1970,VII,By suiting action to the divine Word?
1971,VII,"His spleen was chronic, true; but he preferred"
1972,VII,Its subtle agony to the brute force
1973,VII,That tugged the barbs of deep-anchored remorse.
1974,VII,The sunlight wrapped folds of soft golden silk
1975,VII,"About him, and the air was warm as milk"
1976,VII,Against his skin. Long sitting still had made
1977,VII,"Cramped soreness such a pleasure, he was afraid"
1978,VII,"To shift his tortured limbs, lest he should mar"
1979,VII,Life’s evenness. London’s noise from afar
1980,VII,"Smoothed out its harshness to soothe his thoughts asleep,"
1981,VII,Sound that made silence much more calm and deep.
1982,VII,"The domes of gold, the leaves, emerald bright,"
1983,VII,"Were intense, piercing arrows of delight."
1984,VII,He did not think; thought was a shallow thing
1985,VII,"To his deep sense of life, of mere being."
1986,VII,"He looked at his hand, lying there on his knee,"
1987,VII,"The blue veins branching, the tendons cunningly"
1988,VII,Dancing like jacks in a piano if he shook
1989,VII,"A knot-boned finger. Only to look and look,"
1990,VII,"Till he knew it, each hair and every pore—"
1991,VII,It seemed enough: what need of anything more?
1992,VII,"Thought, a blind alley; action, which at best"
1993,VII,Is cudgelling water that goes back to rest
1994,VII,As soon as you give over your violences.
1995,VII,"No, wisdom culls the flowers of the five senses,"
1996,VII,Savouring the secret sweetness they afford:
1997,VII,Instead of which he had a Medical Board
1998,VII,"Next week, and they would pass him fit. Good Lord!"
1999,VII,
2000,VII,"Well, let all pass."
2001,VII,"But one must outdo fate,"
2002,VII,"Wear clothes more modish than the fashion, run"
2003,VII,"Faster than time, not merely stand and wait;"
2004,VII,Do in a flash what cannot be undone
2005,VII,Through ten eternities. Predestinate?
2006,VII,"So would God be—that is, if there were one:"
2007,VII,General epidemic which spoils nobody’s fun.
2008,VII,"Action, action! Quickly rise and do"
2009,VII,"The most irreparable things; beget,"
2010,VII,"In one brief consummation of the will,"
2011,VII,"Remorse, reaction, wretchedness, regret."
2012,VII,Action! This was no time for sitting still.
2013,VII,
2014,VII,He crushed his hat down over his eyes
2015,VII,And walked with a stamp to symbolise
2016,VII,"Action, action—left, right, left;"
2017,VII,"Planting his feet with a slabby beat,"
2018,VII,"Taking strange Procrustean steps,"
2019,VII,"Lengthened, shortened to avoid"
2020,VII,Touching the lines between the stones—
2021,VII,A thing which makes God so annoyed.
2022,VII,
2023,VII,"Action, action! First of all"
2024,VII,He spent three pounds he couldn’t afford
2025,VII,"In buying a book he didn’t want,"
2026,VII,For the mere sake of having been
2027,VII,Irrevocably extravagant.
2028,VII,"Then feeling very bold, he pressed"
2029,VII,The bell of a chance house; it might
2030,VII,Disclose some New Arabian Night
2031,VII,"Behind its grimy husk, who knows?"
2032,VII,The seconds passed; all was dead.
2033,VII,Arrogantly he rang once more.
2034,VII,His heart thumped on sheer silence; but at last
2035,VII,There was a shuffling; something behind the door
2036,VII,"Became approaching panic, and he fled."
2037,VII,
2038,VII,
2039,VII,
2040,VII,
2041,VIII,VIII
2042,VIII,"“MISERY,” he said, “to have no chin,"
2043,VIII,Nothing but brains and sex and taste:
2044,VIII,"Only omissively to sin,"
2045,VIII,Weakly kind and cowardly chaste.
2046,VIII,
2047,VIII,"But when the war is over,"
2048,VIII,I will go to the East and plant
2049,VIII,"Tea and rubber, and make much money."
2050,VIII,I will eat the black sweat of niggers
2051,VIII,And flagellate them with whips.
2052,VIII,"I shall be enormously myself,"
2053,VIII,Incarnate Chin.”
2054,VIII,
2055,VIII,The anguish of thinking ill of oneself
2056,VIII,"(St. Paul’s religion, poignant beyond words)"
2057,VIII,Turns ere you know it to faint minor thirds
2058,VIII,Before the ritualistic pomps of the world—
2059,VIII,"The glass-grey silver of rivers, silken skies unfurled,"
2060,VIII,"Urim and Thummim of dawn and sun-setting,"
2061,VIII,"And the lawn sleeves of a great episcopal cloud,"
2062,VIII,"Matins of song and vesperal murmuring,"
2063,VIII,Incense of night-long flowers and earth new-ploughed;
2064,VIII,All beauties of sweetness and all that shine or sing.
2065,VIII,Conscience is smoothed by beauty’s subtle fingers
2066,VIII,"Into voluptuousness, where nothing lingers"
2067,VIII,"Of bitterness, saving a sorrow that is"
2068,VIII,Rather a languor than a sense of pain.
2069,VIII,
2070,VIII,"So, from the tunnel of St. Martin’s Lane"
2071,VIII,"Sailing into the open Square, he felt"
2072,VIII,"His self-reproach, his good resolutions melt"
2073,VIII,"Into an ecstasy, gentle as balm,"
2074,VIII,"Before the spire, etched black and white on the calm"
2075,VIII,"Of a pale windless sky, St. Martin’s spire,"
2076,VIII,And the shadows sleeping beneath the portico
2077,VIII,"And the crowd hurrying, ceaselessly, to and fro."
2078,VIII,"Alas, the bleached and slender tower that aches"
2079,VIII,"Upon the gauzy sky, where blueness breaks"
2080,VIII,"Into sweet hoarseness, veiled with love and tender"
2081,VIII,"As the dove’s voice alone in the woods: too slender,"
2082,VIII,Too finely pencilled—black and bleaching white
2083,VIII,"On smoky mist, too clear in the keen light"
2084,VIII,Of utmost summer: and oh! the lives that pass
2085,VIII,"In one swift stream of colour, too, too bright,"
2086,VIII,"Too swift—and all the lives unknown,"
2087,VIII,Alone.
2088,VIII,Alas. . . .
2089,VIII,
2090,VIII,A truce to summer and beauty and the pain
2091,VIII,Of being too consciously alive among
2092,VIII,"The things that pass and the things that remain,"
2093,VIII,"(Oh, equal sadness!) the pain of being young."
2094,VIII,
2095,VIII,"Truce, truce. . . . Once again he fled;—"
2096,VIII,"All his life, it seemed, was a flight;—"
2097,VIII,Fled and found
2098,VIII,Sanctuary in a cinema house.
2099,VIII,"Huge faces loomed and burst,"
2100,VIII,Like bubbles in a black wind.
2101,VIII,He shut his eyes on them and in a little
2102,VIII,"Slept; slept, while the pictures"
2103,VIII,"Passed and returned, passed once more and returned."
2104,VIII,"And he, like God in the midst of the wheeling world,"
2105,VIII,Slept on; and when he woke it was eight o’clock.
2106,VIII,Jenny? Revenge is sweet; he will have kept
2107,VIII,Dear Jenny waiting.
2108,VIII,
2109,VIII,
2110,VIII,
2111,VIII,
2112,IX,IX
2113,IX,TALL straight poplars stand in a meadow;
2114,IX,"The wind and sun caress them, dappling"
2115,IX,The deep green grass with shine and shadow;
2116,IX,And a little apart one slender sapling
2117,IX,Sways in the wind and almost seems
2118,IX,"Conscious of its own supple grace,"
2119,IX,And shakes its twin-hued leaves and gleams
2120,IX,"With silvery laughter, filling the place"
2121,IX,Where it stands with a sudden flash of human
2122,IX,Beauty and grace; till from her tree
2123,IX,"Steps forth the dryad, now turned woman,"
2124,IX,And sways to meet him. It is she.
2125,IX,
2126,IX,"Food and drink, food and drink:"
2127,IX,Olives as firm and sleek and green
2128,IX,"As the breasts of a sea god’s daughter,"
2129,IX,Swimming far down where the corpses sink
2130,IX,Through the dense shadowy water.
2131,IX,"Silver and black on flank and back,"
2132,IX,The glossy sardine mourns its head.
2133,IX,"The red anchovy and the beetroot red,"
2134,IX,"With carrots, build a gorgeous stair—"
2135,IX,"Bronze, apoplexy and Venetian hair—"
2136,IX,And the green pallor of the salad round
2137,IX,Sharpens their clarion sound.
2138,IX,De lady take hors d’œuvres? and de gentleman too?
2139,IX,Per due! Due! Echo answers: Du’ . . .
2140,IX,"“So, Jenny, you’ve found another Perfect Man.”"
2141,IX,"“Perfect, perhaps; but not so sweet as you,"
2142,IX,"Not such a baby.” “Me? A baby. Why,"
2143,IX,I am older than the rocks on which I sit. . . .”
2144,IX,"Oh, how delightful, talking about oneself!"
2145,IX,
2146,IX,"Golden wine, pale as a Tuscan primitive,"
2147,IX,"And wine’s strange taste, half loathsome, half delicious:"
2148,IX,"Come, my Lesbia, let us love and live."
2149,IX,What though the mind still think that one thing’s vicious
2150,IX,More than another? If the thought can give
2151,IX,"This wine’s rich savour to our laughing kiss,"
2152,IX,Let us preserve the Christian prejudice.
2153,IX,"Oh, there are shynesses and silences,"
2154,IX,Shynesses and silences!
2155,IX,But luckily God also gave us wine.
2156,IX,
2157,IX,"“Jenny, adorable—” (what draws the line"
2158,IX,At the mere word “love”?) “has anyone the right
2159,IX,"To look so lovely as you look to-night,"
2160,IX,"To have such eyes, such a helmet of bright hair?”"
2161,IX,"But candidly, he wondered, do I care?"
2162,IX,
2163,IX,"He heard her voice and himself spoke,"
2164,IX,"But like faint light through a cloud of smoke,"
2165,IX,"There came, unreal and far away,"
2166,IX,Mere sounds utterly empty—like the drone
2167,IX,"Of prayers, _crambe repetita_, prayers and praise,"
2168,IX,"Long, long ago, in the old School Chapel days;"
2169,IX,"Senseless, but so intrusive on one’s own"
2170,IX,Interior life one couldn’t even think . . .
2171,IX,
2172,IX,"O sweet, rare, perilous, retchy drink!"
2173,IX,Another glass . . .

2177,IX,
2178,X,X
2179,X,"HOW cool is the moonless summer night, how sweet"
2180,X,After the noise and the dizzy choking heat!
2181,X,The bloodless lamps look down upon their own
2182,X,"Green image in the polished roadway thrown,"
2183,X,"And onward and out of sight the great road runs,"
2184,X,Smooth and dark as a river of calm bronze.
2185,X,
2186,X,"Freedom and widening space: his life expands,"
2187,X,"Ready, it seems, to burst the iron bands"
2188,X,"Of self, to fuse with other lives and be"
2189,X,"Not one but the world, no longer “I” but “She.”"
2190,X,
2191,X,"See, like the dolorous memory"
2192,X,"Of happy times in misery,"
2193,X,An aged hansom fills the street
2194,X,With the superannuated beat
2195,X,Of hollow hoofs and bells that chime
2196,X,Out of another quieter time.
2197,X,
2198,X,"“Good-night,” the last kiss, “and God bless you, my dear.”"
2199,X,"So, she was gone, she who had been so near,"
2200,X,So breathing-warm—soft mouth and hands and hair—
2201,X,"A moment since. Had she been really there,"
2202,X,"Close at his side, and had he kissed her? It seemed"
2203,X,Unlikely as something somebody else had dreamed
2204,X,"And talked about at breakfast, being a bore:"
2205,X,"Improbable, unsubstantial, dim, yet more"
2206,X,Real than the rest of life; real as the blaze
2207,X,"Of a sudden-seen picture, as the lightning phrase"
2208,X,With which the poet-gods strangely create
2209,X,Their brief bright world beyond the reach of fate.
2210,X,Yet he could wonder now if he had kissed
2211,X,Her or his own loved thoughts. Did she exist
2212,X,Now she was history and safely stowed
2213,X,"Down in the past? There (with a conscious smile),"
2214,X,"There let her rest eternal. And meanwhile,"
2215,X,"Lamp-fringed towards meeting parallels, the road"
2216,X,"Stretched out and out, and the old weary horse,"
2217,X,"Come from the past, went jogging his homeward course"
2218,X,"Uphill through time to some demoded place,"
2219,X,On ghostly hoofs back to the safe Has-Been:—
2220,X,But fact returns insistent as remorse;
2221,X,"Uphill towards Hampstead, back to the year of grace"
2222,X,Nineteen hundred and seventeen.
