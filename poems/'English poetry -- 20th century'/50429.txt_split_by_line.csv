68,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,"The Editors of this year’s Oxford Poetry, the work of undergraduates"
69,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,"who have been in residence since the date of the last collection, have"
70,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,attempted to make the volume more representative of Poetry and less
71,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,representative merely of Oxford than its predecessors. There is always
72,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,"at Oxford a fashion in verse as much as in dress, and, to judge from"
73,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,"the bulk of contributions submitted, this fashion has not changed"
74,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,"materially since last noted and recorded in print. Mr Jones-Smith, of"
75,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,"Balliol, still writes musically of brimming chalices, vermilion lips,"
76,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,"chrysoprase, lotuses, arabesques and darkling spires against glimmering"
77,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,"skies; Miss Smith-Jones, of Somerville, is equally faithful to her"
78,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,"scarlet sins, beloved hearts, little clutching hands, little pattering"
79,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,"feet, rosaries, eternity, roundabouts, and glimmering spires against"
80,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,darkling skies. Exclusion of these worn properties has given the fewer
81,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,"writers than usual represented here, extended elbow room, and a chance"
82,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,of showing some individual capacity for better or worse.
83,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,
84,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,Most of the pieces have already appeared serially in _The London
85,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,"Mercury_, _The Spectator_, _The Westminster Gazette_, _The New"
86,STRATFORD-UPON-AVON,"Statesman_, _The Nation and Athenæum_, _The Observer_, and the other"

190,THE WATERMILL,THE WATERMILL
191,THE WATERMILL,
192,THE WATERMILL,I’ll rise at midnight and I’ll rove
193,THE WATERMILL,Up the hill and down the drove
194,THE WATERMILL,"That leads to the old unnoticed mill,"
195,THE WATERMILL,And think of one I used to love:
196,THE WATERMILL,There stooping to the hunching wall
197,THE WATERMILL,I’ll stare into the rush of stars
198,THE WATERMILL,Or bubbles that the waterfall
199,THE WATERMILL,Brings forth and breaks in ceaseless wars.
200,THE WATERMILL,
201,THE WATERMILL,The shelving hills have made a fourm
202,THE WATERMILL,"Where the mill holdings shelter warm,"
203,THE WATERMILL,And here I came with one I loved
204,THE WATERMILL,To watch the seething millions swarm.
205,THE WATERMILL,But long ago she grew a ghost
206,THE WATERMILL,Though walking with me every day;
207,THE WATERMILL,Even when her beauty burned me most
208,THE WATERMILL,She to a spectre dimmed away--
209,THE WATERMILL,
210,THE WATERMILL,Until though cheeks all morning-bright
211,THE WATERMILL,And black eyes gleaming life’s delight
212,THE WATERMILL,"And singing voice dwelt in my sense,"
213,THE WATERMILL,Herself paled on my inward sight.
214,THE WATERMILL,She grew one whom deep waters glassed.
215,THE WATERMILL,"Then in dismay I hid from her,"
216,THE WATERMILL,And lone by talking brooks at last
217,THE WATERMILL,I found a Love still lovelier.
218,THE WATERMILL,
219,THE WATERMILL,O lost in tortured days of France!
220,THE WATERMILL,Yet still the moment comes like chance
221,THE WATERMILL,Born in the stirring midnight’s sigh
222,THE WATERMILL,Or in the wild wet sunset’s glance:
223,THE WATERMILL,And how I know not but this stream
224,THE WATERMILL,"Still sounds like vision’s voice, and still"
225,THE WATERMILL,"I watch with Love the bubbles gleam,"
226,THE WATERMILL,I walk with Love beside the mill.
227,THE WATERMILL,
228,THE WATERMILL,"The heavens are thralled with cloud, yet gray"
229,THE WATERMILL,"Half-moonlight swims the fields till day,"
230,THE WATERMILL,"The stubbled fields, the bleaching woods;--"
231,THE WATERMILL,Even this bleak hour is stolen away
232,THE WATERMILL,"By this shy water falling low,"
233,THE WATERMILL,"And calling low the whole night through,"
234,THE WATERMILL,And calling back the long ago
235,THE WATERMILL,And richest world I ever knew.
236,THE WATERMILL,
237,THE WATERMILL,The hop-kiln fingers cobweb-white
238,THE WATERMILL,"With discord dim turned left and right,"
239,THE WATERMILL,And when the wind was south and small
240,THE WATERMILL,The sea’s far whisper drowsed the night;
241,THE WATERMILL,Scarce more than mantling ivy’s voice
242,THE WATERMILL,That in the tumbling water trailed.
243,THE WATERMILL,Love’s spirit called me to rejoice
244,THE WATERMILL,When she to nothingness had paled:
245,THE WATERMILL,
246,THE WATERMILL,For Love the daffodils shone here
247,THE WATERMILL,"In grass the greenest of the year,"
248,THE WATERMILL,Daffodils seemed the sunset lights
249,THE WATERMILL,And silver birches budded clear:
250,THE WATERMILL,And all from east to west there strode
251,THE WATERMILL,"Great shafted clouds in argent air,"
252,THE WATERMILL,"The shining chariot-wheels of God,"
253,THE WATERMILL,And still Love’s moment sees them there.
254,THE WATERMILL,
255,THE WATERMILL,
256,THE SCYTHE,THE SCYTHE
257,THE SCYTHE,
258,THE SCYTHE,A thick hot haze had choked the valley grounds
259,THE SCYTHE,"Long since, the dogday sun had gone his rounds"
260,THE SCYTHE,Like a dull coal half lit with sulky heat;
261,THE SCYTHE,"And leas were iron, ponds were clay, fierce beat"
262,THE SCYTHE,The blackening flies round moody cattle’s eyes.
263,THE SCYTHE,"Wasps on the mudbanks seemed a hornet’s size,"
264,THE SCYTHE,That on the dead roach battened. The plough’s increase
265,THE SCYTHE,Stood under a curse.
266,THE SCYTHE,"Behold, the far release!"
267,THE SCYTHE,Old wisdom breathless at her cottage door
268,THE SCYTHE,"‘Sounds of abundance’ mused, and heard the roar"
269,THE SCYTHE,"Of marshalled armies in the silent air,"
270,THE SCYTHE,"And thought Elisha stood beside her there,"
271,THE SCYTHE,And clacking reckoned ere the next nightfall
272,THE SCYTHE,She’d turn the looking-glasses to the wall.
273,THE SCYTHE,
274,THE SCYTHE,Faster than armies out of the burnt void
275,THE SCYTHE,The hour-glass clouds innumerably deployed;
276,THE SCYTHE,"And when the hay-folks next look up, the sky"
277,THE SCYTHE,Sags black above them; scarce is time to fly.
278,THE SCYTHE,And most run for their cottages; but Ward
279,THE SCYTHE,"The mower for the inn beside the ford,"
280,THE SCYTHE,"And slow strides he with shouldered scythe still bare,"
281,THE SCYTHE,While to the coverts leaps the great-eyed hare.
282,THE SCYTHE,
283,THE SCYTHE,"As he came in, the dust snatched up and whirled"
284,THE SCYTHE,"Hung high, and like a bell-rope whipped and twirled,"
285,THE SCYTHE,"The brazen light glared round, the haze resolved"
286,THE SCYTHE,Into demoniac shapes bulged and convolved.
287,THE SCYTHE,"Well might poor ewes afar make bleatings wild,"
288,THE SCYTHE,"Though this old trusting mower sat and smiled,"
289,THE SCYTHE,For from the hush of many days the land
290,THE SCYTHE,Had waked itself: and now on every hand
291,THE SCYTHE,"Shrill swift alarm-notes, cries and counter-cries,"
292,THE SCYTHE,Lowings and crowings came and throbbing sighs.
293,THE SCYTHE,"Now atom lightning brandished on the moor,"
294,THE SCYTHE,Then out of sullen drumming came the roar
295,THE SCYTHE,Of thunder joining battle east and west:
296,THE SCYTHE,"In hedge and orchard small birds durst not rest,"
297,THE SCYTHE,"Flittering like dead leaves and like wisps of straws,"
298,THE SCYTHE,"And the cuckoo called again, for without pause"
299,THE SCYTHE,Oncoming voices in the vortex burred.
300,THE SCYTHE,"The storm came toppling like a wave, and blurred"
301,THE SCYTHE,In grey the trees that like black steeples towered.
302,THE SCYTHE,The sun’s last yellow died. Then who but cowered?
303,THE SCYTHE,"Down ruddying darkness floods the hideous flash,"
304,THE SCYTHE,And pole to pole the cataract whirlwinds clash.
305,THE SCYTHE,
306,THE SCYTHE,Alone within the tavern parlour still
307,THE SCYTHE,"Sat the gray mower, pondering his God’s will,"
308,THE SCYTHE,"And flinching not to flame or bolt, that swooped"
309,THE SCYTHE,With a great hissing rain till terror drooped
310,THE SCYTHE,In weariness: and then there came a roar
311,THE SCYTHE,"Ten-thousand-fold, he saw not, was no more--"
312,THE SCYTHE,"But life bursts on him once again, and blood"
313,THE SCYTHE,"Beats droning round, and light comes in a flood."
314,THE SCYTHE,
315,THE SCYTHE,"He stares, and sees the sashes battered awry,"
316,THE SCYTHE,"The wainscot shivered, the crocks shattered, and by,"
317,THE SCYTHE,"His twisted scythe, melted by its fierce foe,"
318,THE SCYTHE,Whose Parthian shot struck down the chimney. Slow
319,THE SCYTHE,"Old Ward lays hand to his old working-friend,"
320,THE SCYTHE,And thanking God Whose mercy did defend
321,THE SCYTHE,"His servant, yet must drop a tear or two"
322,THE SCYTHE,"And think of times when that old scythe was new,"
323,THE SCYTHE,"And stands in silent grief, nor hears the voices"
324,THE SCYTHE,"Of many a bird that through the land rejoices,"
325,THE SCYTHE,"Nor sees through the smashed panes the sea-green sky,"
326,THE SCYTHE,"That ripens into blue, nor knows the storm is by."
327,THE SCYTHE,
328,THE SCYTHE,
329,THE TIME IS GONE,THE TIME IS GONE
330,THE TIME IS GONE,
331,THE TIME IS GONE,The time is gone when we could throw
332,THE TIME IS GONE,"Our angle in the sleepy stream,"
333,THE TIME IS GONE,And nothing more desired to know
334,THE TIME IS GONE,Than was it roach or was it bream?
335,THE TIME IS GONE,"Sitting there in such a mute delight,"
336,THE TIME IS GONE,The Kingfisher would come and on the rods alight.
337,THE TIME IS GONE,
338,THE TIME IS GONE,Or hurrying through the dewy hay
339,THE TIME IS GONE,Without a thought but to make haste
340,THE TIME IS GONE,We came to where the old ring lay
341,THE TIME IS GONE,And bats and balls seemed heaven at least.
342,THE TIME IS GONE,With our laughing and our giant strokes
343,THE TIME IS GONE,The echoes clacked among the chestnuts and the oaks.
344,THE TIME IS GONE,
345,THE TIME IS GONE,When the spring came up we got
346,THE TIME IS GONE,And out among wild Emmet Hills
347,THE TIME IS GONE,"Blossoms, aye and pleasures sought"
348,THE TIME IS GONE,"And found! bloom withers, pleasure chills;"
349,THE TIME IS GONE,Like geographers along green brooks
350,THE TIME IS GONE,We named the capes and tumbling bays and horseshoe crooks.
351,THE TIME IS GONE,
352,THE TIME IS GONE,But one day I found a man
353,THE TIME IS GONE,Leaning on the bridge’s rail;
354,THE TIME IS GONE,"Dared his face as all to scan,"
355,THE TIME IS GONE,And awestruck wondered what could ail

360,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND
361,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
362,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"We stood by the idle weir,"
363,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Like bells the waters played,"
364,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,The rich moonlight slept everywhere
365,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,As it would never fade:
366,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,So slept our shining peace of mind
367,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Till rose a south-west wind.
368,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
369,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,How sorrow comes who knows?
370,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,And here joy surely had been:
371,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,But joy like any wild wind blows
372,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"From mountains none has seen,"
373,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,And still its cloudy veilings throws
374,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,On the bright road it goes.
375,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
376,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,The black-plumed poplars swung
377,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,So softly across the sky:
378,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"The ivy sighed, the river sung,"
379,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Woolpacks were wafting high:
380,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,The moon her golden tinges flung
381,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,On these she straight was lost among.
382,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,
383,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"O south-west wind of the soul,"
384,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"That brought such new delight,"
385,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,And passing by in music stole
386,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,"Love’s rich and trusting light,"
387,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Would that we thrilled to thy least breath
388,THE SOUTH-WEST WIND,Now all is still as death.

391,THE CANAL,THE CANAL
392,THE CANAL,
393,THE CANAL,There so dark and still
394,THE CANAL,"Slept the water, never changing,"
395,THE CANAL,From the glad sport in the meadows
396,THE CANAL,Oft I turned me.
397,THE CANAL,
398,THE CANAL,Fear would strike me chill
399,THE CANAL,"On the clearest day in summer,"
400,THE CANAL,Yet I loved to stand and ponder
401,THE CANAL,Hours together
402,THE CANAL,
403,THE CANAL,By the tarred bridge rail--
404,THE CANAL,"There the lockman’s vine-clad window,"
405,THE CANAL,Mirrored in the tomb-like water
406,THE CANAL,Stared in silence
407,THE CANAL,
408,THE CANAL,"Till, deformed and pale"
409,THE CANAL,"In the sunken cavern shadows,"
410,THE CANAL,One by one imagined demons
411,THE CANAL,Scowled upon me.
412,THE CANAL,
413,THE CANAL,"Barges passed me by,"
414,THE CANAL,With their unknown surly masters
415,THE CANAL,"And small cabins, whereon some rude"
416,THE CANAL,Hand had painted
417,THE CANAL,
418,THE CANAL,Trees and castles high.
419,THE CANAL,"Cheerly stepped the towing horses,"
420,THE CANAL,And the women sung their children
421,THE CANAL,Into slumber.
422,THE CANAL,
423,THE CANAL,"Barges, too, I saw"
424,THE CANAL,"Drowned in mud, drowned, drowned long ages,"
425,THE CANAL,"Their gray ribs but seen in summer,"
426,THE CANAL,Their names never:
427,THE CANAL,
428,THE CANAL,In whose silted maw
429,THE CANAL,"Swarmed great eels, the priests of darkness,"
430,THE CANAL,"Old as they, who came at midnight"
431,THE CANAL,To destroy me.
432,THE CANAL,
433,THE CANAL,Like one blind and lame
434,THE CANAL,Who by some new sense has vision
435,THE CANAL,And strikes deadlier than the strongest
436,THE CANAL,Went this water.
437,THE CANAL,
438,THE CANAL,"Many an angler came,"
439,THE CANAL,"Went his ways; and I would know them,"
440,THE CANAL,"Some would smile and give me greeting,"
441,THE CANAL,Some kept silence--
442,THE CANAL,
443,THE CANAL,"Most, one old dragoon"
444,THE CANAL,"Who had never a morning hallo,"
445,THE CANAL,But with stony eye strode onward
446,THE CANAL,"Till the water,"
447,THE CANAL,
448,THE CANAL,"On a silent noon,"
449,THE CANAL,"That had watched him long, commanded:"
450,THE CANAL,"Whom he answered, leaping headlong"
451,THE CANAL,To self-murder.
452,THE CANAL,
453,THE CANAL,"‘Fear and fly the spell,’"
454,THE CANAL,Thus my Spirit sang beside me;
455,THE CANAL,"Then once more I ranged the meadows,"
456,THE CANAL,"Yet still brooded,"
457,THE CANAL,
458,THE CANAL,When the threefold knell
459,THE CANAL,Sounded through the haze of harvest--
460,THE CANAL,Who had found the lame blind water
461,THE CANAL,Swift and seeing?

464,THE MARCH BEE,THE MARCH BEE
465,THE MARCH BEE,
466,THE MARCH BEE,A warming wind comes to my resting-place
467,THE MARCH BEE,And in a mountain cloud the lost sun chills;
468,THE MARCH BEE,"Night comes, and yet before she shows her face"
469,THE MARCH BEE,"The sun flings off the shadows, warm light fills"
470,THE MARCH BEE,"The valley and the clearings on the hills,"
471,THE MARCH BEE,"Bleak crow the moorcocks on the fen’s blue plashes,"
472,THE MARCH BEE,But here I warm myself with these bright looks and flashes.
473,THE MARCH BEE,And like to me the merry humble bee
474,THE MARCH BEE,"Puts fear aside, runs forth to meet the sun"
475,THE MARCH BEE,And by the ploughlands’ shoulder comes to see
476,THE MARCH BEE,"The flowers that like him best, and seems to shun"
477,THE MARCH BEE,"Cold countless quaking windflowers every one,"
478,THE MARCH BEE,Primroses too; but makes poor grass his choice
479,THE MARCH BEE,Where small wood-strawberry blossoms nestle and rejoice.
480,THE MARCH BEE,"The magpies steering round from wood to wood,"
481,THE MARCH BEE,"Tree-creepers flicking up to elms’ green rind,"
482,THE MARCH BEE,Bold gnats that revel round my solitude
483,THE MARCH BEE,And most this pleasant bee intent to find
484,THE MARCH BEE,"The new-born joy, inveigle the rich mind"
485,THE MARCH BEE,Long after darkness comes cold-lipped to one
486,THE MARCH BEE,"Still hearkening to the bee, still basking in the sun."

547,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,(_For F. V. Branford_)
548,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
549,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,The shepherd sings:
550,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"’_Way down in Dixie,"
551,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Way down in Dixie,"
552,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Where the hens are dog-gone glad to lay...._’
553,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
554,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,With shaded eyes he stands to look
555,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Across the hills where the clouds swoon,"
556,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"He singing, leans upon his crook,"
557,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"He sings, he sings no more."
558,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,The wind is muffled in the tangled hair
559,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Of sheep that drift along the noon.
560,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,The mild sheep stare
561,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,With amber eyes about the pearl-flecked June.
562,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Two skylarks soar
563,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,With singing flame
564,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Into the sun whence first they came.
565,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,All else is only grasshoppers
566,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Or a brown wing the shepherd stirs,"
567,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Who, like a slow tree moving, goes"
568,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Where the pale tide of sheep-drift flows.
569,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
570,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,See! the sun smites
571,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,With molten lights
572,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,The turned wing of a gull that glows
573,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Aslant the violet, the profound"
574,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Dome of the mid-June heights.
575,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Alas! again the grasshoppers,"
576,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"The birds, the slumber-winging bees,"
577,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Alas! again for those and these
578,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Demure things drowned;
579,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Drowned in vain raucous words men made
580,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Where no lark rose with swift and sweet
581,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Ascent and where no dim sheep strayed
582,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"About the stone immensities,"
583,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Where no sheep strayed and where no bees
584,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Probed any flowers nor swung a blade
585,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Of grass with pollened feet.
586,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
587,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,He sings:
588,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"‘_In Dixie,"
589,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Way down in Dixie,"
590,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Where the hens are dog-gone glad to lay
591,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Scrambled eggs in the new-mown hay...._’
592,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
593,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,The herring-gulls with peevish cries
594,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Rebuke the man who sings vain words;
595,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"His sheep-dog growls a low complaint,"
596,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Then turns to chasing butterflies.
597,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,But when the indifferent singing-birds
598,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,From midmost down to dimmest shore
599,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Innumerably confirm their songs,"
600,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,And grasshoppers make summer rhyme
601,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,And solemn bees in the wild thyme
602,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Clash cymbals and beat gongs,"
603,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"The shepherd’s words once more are faint,"
604,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Once more the alien song is thinned
605,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Upon the long course of the wind,"
606,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"He sings, he sings no more."
607,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
608,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Ah now the dear monotonies
609,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Of bells that jangle on the sheep
610,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,To the low limit of the hills!
611,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Till the blue cup of music spills
612,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Into the boughs of lowland trees;
613,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Till thence the lowland singings creep
614,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Into the dreamful shepherd’s head,"
615,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Creep drowsily through his blood;
616,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"The young thrush fluting all he knows,"
617,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"The ring dove moaning his false woes,"
618,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Almost the rabbit’s tiny tread,"
619,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,The last unfolding bud.
620,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"But now,"
621,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Now a cool word spreads out along the sea.
622,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Now the day’s violet is cloud-tipped with gold.
623,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Now dusk most silently
624,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Fills the hushed day with other wings than birds’.
625,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Now where on foam-crest waves the seagulls rock,"
626,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,To their cliff-haven go the seagulls thence.
627,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"So too the shepherd gathers in his flock,"
628,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Because birds journey to their dens,"
629,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Tired sheep to their still fold.
630,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
631,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,A dark first bat swoops low and dips
632,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,About the shepherd who now sings
633,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,A song of timeless evenings;
634,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"For dusk is round him with wide wings,"
635,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Dusk murmurs on his moving lips.
636,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
637,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,_There is not mortal man who knows
638,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,From whence the shepherd’s song arose:
639,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,It came a thousand years ago._
640,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
641,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,_Once the world’s shepherds woke to lead
642,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,The folded sheep that they might feed
643,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,On green downs where winds blow._
644,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
645,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,_One shepherd sang a golden word.
646,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,A thousand miles away one heard.
647,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"One sang it swift, one sang it slow._"
648,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
649,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"_Two skylarks heard, two skylarks told"
650,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,All shepherds this same song of gold
651,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,On all downs where winds blow._
652,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
653,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,_This is the song that shepherds must
654,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Sing till the green downlands be dust
655,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,And tide of sheep-drift no more flow;_
656,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
657,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,_The song two skylarks told again

686,GHOSTS GATHERING,--What seek they? Who knows them? If branches creak
687,GHOSTS GATHERING,
688,GHOSTS GATHERING,"And leaves flap and slow women ply their trade,"

690,GHOSTS GATHERING,

695,GHOSTS GATHERING,"Love wilts, Death does not wilt. What more left now?"
696,GHOSTS GATHERING,But one ghost yet of all these ghosts may find
697,GHOSTS GATHERING,Himself not utterly faded.
698,GHOSTS GATHERING,Through his blind
699,GHOSTS GATHERING,
700,GHOSTS GATHERING,Some old man’s lamp-rays probe the darkness. Sick
701,GHOSTS GATHERING,"Of his gaunt quest, the ghost halts. The clock’s tick"
702,GHOSTS GATHERING,
703,GHOSTS GATHERING,Troubles the silence. Tiredly the ghost scans
704,GHOSTS GATHERING,"The opened book on the table. A flame fans,"
705,GHOSTS GATHERING,
706,GHOSTS GATHERING,A weak wan fire floods through his subtle veins.
707,GHOSTS GATHERING,"No, no, not wholly forgotten! Loves and pains"

722,GHOSTS GATHERING,Closer against the table. And sitting bowed
723,GHOSTS GATHERING,Lovingly turns the leaves and chants aloud.

1211,TRAMP,
1212,TRAMP,"When a brass sun staggers above the sky,"
1213,TRAMP,"When feet cleave to boots, and the tongue’s dry,"
1214,TRAMP,"And sharp dust goads the rolling eye,"
1215,TRAMP,"Come thoughts of wine, and dancing thoughts of girls:"
1216,TRAMP,"They shiver their white arms, and the head whirls,"
1217,TRAMP,And noon light is hid in their dark curls:
1218,TRAMP,"Noon feet stumble, and head swims."
1219,TRAMP,"Out shines the sun, and the thought dims,"
1220,TRAMP,"And death, for blood, runs in the weak limbs."
1221,TRAMP,
1222,TRAMP,To fall on flints in the shade of tall nettles
1223,TRAMP,"Gives easy sleep as a bed of rose petals,"
1224,TRAMP,And dust drifting from the highway
1225,TRAMP,As light a coverlet as down may.
1226,TRAMP,The myriad feet of many-sized flies
1227,TRAMP,May not open those tired eyes.
1228,TRAMP,
1229,TRAMP,The first wind of night
1230,TRAMP,Twitches the coverlet away quite:
1231,TRAMP,The first wind and large first rain
1232,TRAMP,Flickers the dry pulse to life again:
1233,TRAMP,Flickers the lids burning on the eyes
1234,TRAMP,With sudden flashes of the slipping skies.
1235,TRAMP,"Hunger, oldest visionary,"
1236,TRAMP,"Hides a devil in a tree,"
1237,TRAMP,"Hints a glory in the clouds,"
1238,TRAMP,Fills the crooked air with crowds
1239,TRAMP,Of ivory sightless demons singing--
1240,TRAMP,
1241,TRAMP,Eyes start: straightens back:
1242,TRAMP,Limbs stagger and crack:
1243,TRAMP,"But Brain flies, Brain soars"
1244,TRAMP,"Up, where the Sky roars"
1245,TRAMP,Upon the back of cherubim:
1246,TRAMP,Brain rockets up to Him.
1247,TRAMP,Body gives another twist
1248,TRAMP,To the slack waist-band;
1249,TRAMP,In agony clenches fist
1250,TRAMP,Till the nails bite the hand.
1251,TRAMP,"Body floats light as air,"
1252,TRAMP,With rain in its sparse hair:
1253,TRAMP,
1254,TRAMP,"Brain returns, and would tell"
1255,TRAMP,The things he has seen well:
1256,TRAMP,Body will not stir his lips:
1257,TRAMP,Brain and Body come to grips.
1258,TRAMP,
1259,TRAMP,Deadly each hates the other
1260,TRAMP,As treacherous blood-brother:
1261,TRAMP,"No sight, no sound shows"
1262,TRAMP,How the struggle goes.
1263,TRAMP,
1264,TRAMP,They sink at last faint in the wet gutter;
1265,TRAMP,So many words to sing that the tongue cannot utter.

1269,GRATITUDE,
1270,GRATITUDE,"Eternal gratitude--a long, thin word:"
1271,GRATITUDE,"When meant, oftenest left unheard:"
1272,GRATITUDE,"When light on the tongue, light in the purse too:"
1273,GRATITUDE,Of curious metallurgy: when coined true
1274,GRATITUDE,"It glitters not, is neither large nor small:"
1275,GRATITUDE,"More worth than rubies--less, times, than a ball."
1276,GRATITUDE,"Not gift, nor willed: yet through its wide range"
1277,GRATITUDE,"Buys what it buys exact, and leaves no change."
1278,GRATITUDE,
1279,GRATITUDE,"Old Gurney had it, won on a hot day"
1280,GRATITUDE,"With ale, from glib-voiced Gypsy by the way."
1281,GRATITUDE,He held it lightly: for ’twas a rum start
1282,GRATITUDE,To find a hedgeling who had still a heart:
1283,GRATITUDE,So put it down for twist of a beggar’s tongue...
1284,GRATITUDE,_He_ had not felt the heat: how the dust stung
1285,GRATITUDE,A face June-roasted: _he_ saw not the look
1286,GRATITUDE,Aslant the gift-mug; how the hand shook...
1287,GRATITUDE,"Yet the words rang his head, and he grew merry"
1288,GRATITUDE,"And whistled from the Boar to Wrye-brook ferry,"
1289,GRATITUDE,And chaffed with Ferryman when the hawser creakt
1290,GRATITUDE,Or slipping bilge showed where the planks leakt:
1291,GRATITUDE,"Lent hand himself, till doubly hard the barge"
1292,GRATITUDE,Butted its nose in mud of the farther marge.
1293,GRATITUDE,"When Gurney leapt to shore, he found--dismay!"
1294,GRATITUDE,He had no tuppence--(Tuppence was to pay
1295,GRATITUDE,"To sulky Ferryman)--‘Naught have I,’ says he,"
1296,GRATITUDE,"‘Naught, but the gratitude of Tammas Lee"
1297,GRATITUDE,Given one hour.’--Sulky Charon grinned:
1298,GRATITUDE,"‘Done,’ said he. ‘Done: I take--all of it, mind.’"
1299,GRATITUDE,"‘Done,’ cries Jan Gurney. Down the road he went,"
1300,GRATITUDE,But by the ford left all his merriment.
1301,GRATITUDE,
1302,GRATITUDE,This is the tale of midday chaffering:
1303,GRATITUDE,"How Charon took, and Gurney lost the thing:"
1304,GRATITUDE,How Ferryman gave it for his youngest daughter
1305,GRATITUDE,To a tall lad who saved her out of water--
1306,GRATITUDE,"(Being old and mean, had none of his own to give,"
1307,GRATITUDE,So passed on Tammas’; glad to see her live):
1308,GRATITUDE,And how young Farmer paid his quarter’s rent
1309,GRATITUDE,"With that one coin, when all else was spent,"
1310,GRATITUDE,And how Squire kept it for some goldless debt...
1311,GRATITUDE,"For aught I know, it wanders current yet."
1312,GRATITUDE,Yet Tammas was no angel in disguise:
1313,GRATITUDE,"He stole Squire’s chickens--often: he told lies,"
1314,GRATITUDE,"Robbed Charon’s garden, burnt young Farmer’s ricks"
1315,GRATITUDE,And played the village many lowsy tricks.
1316,GRATITUDE,
1317,GRATITUDE,"No children sniffled, and no dog cried"
1318,GRATITUDE,"When full of oaths and smells, he died."

1459,SUMMER BATHING,"The ruckling pool, torn grey by Pendry Weir,"
1460,SUMMER BATHING,Became Cocytus to my boy time fear.
1461,SUMMER BATHING,"Two haw-trees, pulping fat their close, green fruits"
1462,SUMMER BATHING,"Turned cuttlefish below, wagging no roots"
1463,SUMMER BATHING,But narrow tentacles. Old Jacob Fry
1464,SUMMER BATHING,Tells how he drained this pool one hot July
1465,SUMMER BATHING,When drought had sucked the white stream thick and slow:
1466,SUMMER BATHING,"Fish, four-foot deep, shone thirty feet below."
1467,SUMMER BATHING,"Leaning to drop a stone, the farmboy whews"
1468,SUMMER BATHING,Bewildered that his confident ear should lose
1469,SUMMER BATHING,"All thud for grounding. Now he fears to stay,"

1472,SUMMER BATHING,"Here, when the black bees blundered in the heat"
1473,SUMMER BATHING,"Half-drunk, rifling the fine-flurred meadowsweet,"
1474,SUMMER BATHING,"I stripped and bathed. At first, numb for delight,"
1475,SUMMER BATHING,"I lost all thought but this--Come, you must fight"
1476,SUMMER BATHING,Free from the swirl. But when blank eyes grew clear
1477,SUMMER BATHING,Like a pit-pattering mouse came fluttered fear.
1478,SUMMER BATHING,"Now here and there slide snakish eels, now voles"
1479,SUMMER BATHING,"Bolt hizzing over the brook to round, black holes."
1480,SUMMER BATHING,These groping roots perhaps will grip my flesh

1482,SUMMER BATHING,"Will move, my bones will crackle, I sink down;"

1484,SUMMER BATHING,Or in some cave of brown
1485,SUMMER BATHING,"Sluttering scum and broad, plump bladder-weeds"
1486,SUMMER BATHING,Old fiends may sprawling meditate false deeds;

1489,SUMMER BATHING,
1490,SUMMER BATHING,"Yet, braving all, to prove wild fancy vain,"
1491,SUMMER BATHING,"I held my breath and sank. The brook, astrain"
1492,SUMMER BATHING,"And fierce to be free, spun snarling overhead;"
1493,SUMMER BATHING,"Dull roars droned round, cold currents buffeted."
1494,SUMMER BATHING,"Proud of this daring shewn--but doubtful, too,"
1495,SUMMER BATHING,Of tempting fortune far--I battled through
1496,SUMMER BATHING,"To the root-held scroll of turf on the sagging bank,"
1497,SUMMER BATHING,And carefully muscled up. The sheep-field drank
1498,SUMMER BATHING,"The wide-spent, white-spilt sun, the wrapping air"
1499,SUMMER BATHING,"Swung flame-like past, and, while I ran, the bare"
1500,SUMMER BATHING,Close-nibbled grass pushed hot against my feet.
1501,SUMMER BATHING,The yeanlings rose and rushed with timid bleat
1502,SUMMER BATHING,"Full-tilt at the mothering ewe; fed sleek with clover,"
1503,SUMMER BATHING,"Three cows, in mild amazement bending over"
1504,SUMMER BATHING,"The gap-set palings, rubbed their necks or chewed."
1505,SUMMER BATHING,"But in mid-course I staggered, having trod"
1506,SUMMER BATHING,Firm on a flat and spiny thistle; stayed
1507,SUMMER BATHING,"Nursing my foot, half grinning, half dismayed:"

1609,FRANK PREWETT,Soft-limbed and fashioned lovingly;--
1610,FRANK PREWETT,Must you go marketing your charms
1611,FRANK PREWETT,"In cunning woman-like,"
1612,FRANK PREWETT,And filled with old wives’ tales’ alarms?
1613,FRANK PREWETT,"I tell you, girl, come embrace;"
1614,FRANK PREWETT,What reck we of churchling and priest
1615,FRANK PREWETT,With hands on paunch and chubby face;
1616,FRANK PREWETT,"Behold, we are life’s pitiful least,"
1617,FRANK PREWETT,And we perish at the first smell
1618,FRANK PREWETT,"Of death, whither heaves earth"
1619,FRANK PREWETT,To spurn us cringing into hell.
1620,FRANK PREWETT,"Come girl, and embrace;"
1621,FRANK PREWETT,"Nay, cry not, poor wretch, nor plead,"
1622,FRANK PREWETT,"But haste, for life strikes a swift pace"
1623,FRANK PREWETT,And I burn with envious greed:
1624,FRANK PREWETT,"Know you not, fool, we are the mock,"
1625,FRANK PREWETT,"Of gods, time, clothes, and priests?"
1626,FRANK PREWETT,"But come, there is no time for talk."
1627,FRANK PREWETT,
1628,FRANK PREWETT,
1629,FRANK PREWETT,I went out into the fields
1630,FRANK PREWETT,"In my anguish of mind,"
1631,FRANK PREWETT,And sought comfort of the trees
1632,FRANK PREWETT,For they looked to be kind.
1633,FRANK PREWETT,
1634,FRANK PREWETT,"‘Alas!’ cried they, ‘who have peace?--"
1635,FRANK PREWETT,"We are prey that is caught,"
1636,FRANK PREWETT,"The sun warms us, the blast chills,"
1637,FRANK PREWETT,And we understand not.’
1638,FRANK PREWETT,
1639,FRANK PREWETT,"On rolled the world with fools’ noise,"
1640,FRANK PREWETT,But I strode in tears’ wrack;
1641,FRANK PREWETT,"Would God, fools, I too were fool,"
1642,FRANK PREWETT,Or had light that I lack.
1643,FRANK PREWETT,
1644,FRANK PREWETT,"I held the fields all day,"
1645,FRANK PREWETT,"I, a madman, too;"
1646,FRANK PREWETT,My spirit called aloud
1647,FRANK PREWETT,To sift the false from true.
1648,FRANK PREWETT,
1649,FRANK PREWETT,"The troubled sun turned black,"
1650,FRANK PREWETT,"Earth heaved to and fro,"
1651,FRANK PREWETT,Whene’er I spurned the flowers
1652,FRANK PREWETT,Lifting heads to grow.
1653,FRANK PREWETT,
1654,FRANK PREWETT,"Trees reached their hands to stay,"
1655,FRANK PREWETT,"Whistled birds to me,"
1656,FRANK PREWETT,"‘Spurn one, thou spurnest all,"
1657,FRANK PREWETT,"Brother, let things be."
1658,FRANK PREWETT,
1659,FRANK PREWETT,For not their heads alone
1660,FRANK PREWETT,"Bleed, but the stars fade"
1661,FRANK PREWETT,"And all things grieve, for we"
1662,FRANK PREWETT,One fabric are made.’
1663,FRANK PREWETT,
1664,FRANK PREWETT,The heavens and earth do meet
1665,FRANK PREWETT,"And all things are true,"
1666,FRANK PREWETT,So trample ye no flowers
1667,FRANK PREWETT,Lest skies lose their blue.
1668,FRANK PREWETT,
1669,FRANK PREWETT,
1670,FRANK PREWETT,"Comrade, why do you weep?"
1671,FRANK PREWETT,Is it sorrow for a friend
1672,FRANK PREWETT,"Who fell, rifle in hand,"
1673,FRANK PREWETT,His proud stand at an end?
1674,FRANK PREWETT,
1675,FRANK PREWETT,The harsh thunder-lipped guns
1676,FRANK PREWETT,"Roll his dirge deep and slow,"
1677,FRANK PREWETT,"Where he makes his dreamless bed,"
1678,FRANK PREWETT,Head to head with a foe.
1679,FRANK PREWETT,
1680,FRANK PREWETT,"The sweet lark beats on high,"
1681,FRANK PREWETT,For the joy of those who sleep
1682,FRANK PREWETT,In quiet embrace of earth.
1683,FRANK PREWETT,"Comrade, why do you weep?"
1684,FRANK PREWETT,
1685,FRANK PREWETT,
1686,FRANK PREWETT,"The winds caress the trees,"
1687,FRANK PREWETT,"Woman to man is led,"
1688,FRANK PREWETT,"And I too have my love,"
1689,FRANK PREWETT,Though she comes not to bed.
1690,FRANK PREWETT,
1691,FRANK PREWETT,"Beyond the heat of flesh,"
1692,FRANK PREWETT,"Which has its place and day,"
1693,FRANK PREWETT,We hold our keen delights
1694,FRANK PREWETT,"In spirit, earth away."
1695,FRANK PREWETT,
1696,FRANK PREWETT,"Mount me on high, O soul,"
1697,FRANK PREWETT,"Expand me my desires,"
1698,FRANK PREWETT,So shall I clasp in love
1699,FRANK PREWETT,Even the heavenly fires!
