120,SONG OF POPLARS.,"Shepherd, to yon tall poplars tune your flute:"
121,SONG OF POPLARS.,"Let them pierce, keenly, subtly shrill,"
122,SONG OF POPLARS.,The slow blue rumour of the hill;
123,SONG OF POPLARS.,"Let the grass cry with an anguish of evening gold,"
124,SONG OF POPLARS.,And the great sky be mute.
125,SONG OF POPLARS.,
126,SONG OF POPLARS.,Then hearken how the poplar trees unfold
127,SONG OF POPLARS.,"Their buds, yet close and gummed and blind,"
128,SONG OF POPLARS.,"In airy leafage of the mind,"
129,SONG OF POPLARS.,Rustling in silvery whispers the twin-hued scales
130,SONG OF POPLARS.,That fade not nor grow old.

132,SONG OF POPLARS.,“Poplars and fountains and you cypress spires

137,SONG OF POPLARS.,
138,SONG OF POPLARS.,"“Say, are you happy in the golden march"
139,SONG OF POPLARS.,Of sunlight all across the day?
140,SONG OF POPLARS.,Or do you watch the uncertain way
141,SONG OF POPLARS.,That leads the withering moon on cloudy stairs
142,SONG OF POPLARS.,Over the heaven’s wide arch?
143,SONG OF POPLARS.,
144,SONG OF POPLARS.,“Is it towards sorrow or towards joy you lift
145,SONG OF POPLARS.,The sharpness of your trembling spears?
146,SONG OF POPLARS.,"Or do you seek, through the grey tears"
147,SONG OF POPLARS.,"That blur the sky, in the heart of the triumphing blue,"
148,SONG OF POPLARS.,"A deeper, calmer rift?”"
149,SONG OF POPLARS.,
150,SONG OF POPLARS.,"So; I have tuned my music to the trees,"

160,THE REEF.,
161,THE REEF.,
162,THE REEF.,"My green aquarium of phantom fish,"
163,THE REEF.,Goggling in on me through the misty panes;
164,THE REEF.,My rotting leaves and fields spongy with rains;
165,THE REEF.,My few clear quiet autumn days--I wish
166,THE REEF.,
167,THE REEF.,"I could leave all, clearness and mistiness;"
168,THE REEF.,"Sodden or goldenly crystal, all too still."
169,THE REEF.,"Yes, and I too rot with the leaves that fill"
170,THE REEF.,The hollows in the woods; I am grown less
171,THE REEF.,
172,THE REEF.,"Than human, listless, aimless as the green"
173,THE REEF.,"Idiot fishes of my aquarium,"
174,THE REEF.,Who loiter down their dim tunnels and come
175,THE REEF.,"And look at me and drift away, nought seen"
176,THE REEF.,
177,THE REEF.,"Or understood, but only glazedly"
178,THE REEF.,"Reflected. Upwards, upwards through the shadows,"
179,THE REEF.,Through the lush sponginess of deep-sea meadows
180,THE REEF.,"Where hare-lipped monsters batten, let me ply"
181,THE REEF.,
182,THE REEF.,"Winged fins, bursting this matrix dark to find"
183,THE REEF.,"Jewels and movement, mintage of sunlight"
184,THE REEF.,"Scattered largely by the profuse wind,"
185,THE REEF.,"And gulfs of blue brightness, too deep for sight."
186,THE REEF.,
187,THE REEF.,"Free, newly born, on roads of music and air"
188,THE REEF.,"Speeding and singing, I shall seek the place"
189,THE REEF.,"Where all the shining threads of water race,"
190,THE REEF.,"Drawn in green ropes and foamy meshes. There,"
191,THE REEF.,
192,THE REEF.,On the red fretted ramparts of a tower
193,THE REEF.,"Of coral rooted in the depths, shall break"
194,THE REEF.,An endless sequence of joy and speed and power:
195,THE REEF.,Green shall shatter to foam; flake with white flake
196,THE REEF.,
197,THE REEF.,Shall create an instant’s shining constellation
198,THE REEF.,Upon the blue; and all the air shall be
199,THE REEF.,Full of a million wings that swift and free
200,THE REEF.,"Laugh in the sun, all power and strong elation."
201,THE REEF.,
202,THE REEF.,"Yes, I shall seek that reef, which is beyond"
203,THE REEF.,All isles however magically sleeping
204,THE REEF.,"In tideless seas, uncharted and unconned"
205,THE REEF.,Save by blind eyes: beyond the laughter and weeping
206,THE REEF.,
207,THE REEF.,That brood like a cloud over the lands of men.
208,THE REEF.,"Movement, passion of colour and pure wings,"
209,THE REEF.,Curving to cut like knives--these are the things
210,THE REEF.,I search for:--passion beyond the ken
211,THE REEF.,"Of our foiled violences, and, more swift"
212,THE REEF.,"Than any blow which man aims against time,"
213,THE REEF.,"The invulnerable, motion that shall rift"
214,THE REEF.,"All dimness with the lightning of a rhyme,"
215,THE REEF.,
216,THE REEF.,"Or note, or colour. And the body shall be"
217,THE REEF.,Quick as the mind; and will shall find release
218,THE REEF.,From bondage to brute things; and joyously
219,THE REEF.,"Soul, will and body, in the strength of triune peace,"
220,THE REEF.,
221,THE REEF.,Shall live the perfect grace of power unwasted.
222,THE REEF.,"And love consummate, marvellously blending"
223,THE REEF.,Passion and reverence in a single spring
224,THE REEF.,"Of quickening force, till now never yet tasted,"
225,THE REEF.,
226,THE REEF.,"But ever ceaselessly thirsted for, shall crown"
227,THE REEF.,The new life with its ageless starry fire.
228,THE REEF.,"I go to seek that reef, far down, far down"
229,THE REEF.,"Below the edge of everyday’s desire,"
230,THE REEF.,
231,THE REEF.,"Beyond the magical islands, where of old"
232,THE REEF.,"I was content, dreaming, to give the lie"
233,THE REEF.,To misery. They were all strong and bold
234,THE REEF.,That thither came; and shall I dare to try?

282,THE ELMS.,
283,THE ELMS.,"For a while only. Rooted strong and fast,"

285,THE ELMS.,Their mountain-mass of clotted greenery.
286,THE ELMS.,"Their immaterial season quickly past,"
