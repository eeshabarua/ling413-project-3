420,THE GREAT LOVER,I have been so great a lover: filled my days
421,THE GREAT LOVER,"So proudly with the splendour of Love's praise,"
422,THE GREAT LOVER,"The pain, the calm, and the astonishment,"
423,THE GREAT LOVER,"Desire illimitable, and still content,"
424,THE GREAT LOVER,"And all dear names men use, to cheat despair,"
425,THE GREAT LOVER,For the perplexed and viewless streams that bear
426,THE GREAT LOVER,Our hearts at random down the dark of life.
427,THE GREAT LOVER,"Now, ere the unthinking silence on that strife"
428,THE GREAT LOVER,"Steals down, I would cheat drowsy Death so far,"
429,THE GREAT LOVER,My night shall be remembered for a star
430,THE GREAT LOVER,That outshone all the suns of all men's days.
431,THE GREAT LOVER,Shall I not crown them with immortal praise
432,THE GREAT LOVER,"Whom I have loved, who have given me, dared with me"
433,THE GREAT LOVER,"High secrets, and in darkness knelt to see"
434,THE GREAT LOVER,The inenarrable godhead of delight?
435,THE GREAT LOVER,Love is a flame;--we have beaconed the world's night.
436,THE GREAT LOVER,"A city:--and we have built it, these and I."
437,THE GREAT LOVER,An emperor:--we have taught the world to die.
438,THE GREAT LOVER,"So, for their sakes I loved, ere I go hence,"
439,THE GREAT LOVER,"And the high cause of Love's magnificence,"
440,THE GREAT LOVER,"And to keep loyalties young, I'll write those names"
441,THE GREAT LOVER,"Golden for ever, eagles, crying flames,"
442,THE GREAT LOVER,"And set them as a banner, that men may know,"
443,THE GREAT LOVER,"To dare the generations, burn, and blow"
444,THE GREAT LOVER,"Out on the wind of Time, shining and streaming...."
445,THE GREAT LOVER,These I have loved:
446,THE GREAT LOVER,"White plates and cups, clean-gleaming,"
447,THE GREAT LOVER,"Ringed with blue lines; and feathery, faery dust;"
448,THE GREAT LOVER,"Wet roofs, beneath the lamp-light; the strong crust"
449,THE GREAT LOVER,Of friendly bread; and many-tasting food;
450,THE GREAT LOVER,Rainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of wood;
451,THE GREAT LOVER,And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers;
452,THE GREAT LOVER,"And flowers themselves, that sway through sunny hours,"
453,THE GREAT LOVER,Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon;
454,THE GREAT LOVER,"Then, the cool kindliness of sheets, that soon"
455,THE GREAT LOVER,Smooth away trouble; and the rough male kiss
456,THE GREAT LOVER,Of blankets; grainy wood; live hair that is
457,THE GREAT LOVER,Shining and free; blue-massing clouds; the keen
458,THE GREAT LOVER,Unpassioned beauty of a great machine;
459,THE GREAT LOVER,The benison of hot water; furs to touch;
460,THE GREAT LOVER,The good smell of old clothes; and other such--
461,THE GREAT LOVER,"The comfortable smell of friendly fingers,"
462,THE GREAT LOVER,"Hair's fragrance, and the musty reek that lingers"
463,THE GREAT LOVER,About dead leaves and last year's ferns....
464,THE GREAT LOVER,"Dear names,"
465,THE GREAT LOVER,And thousand other throng to me! Royal flames;
466,THE GREAT LOVER,Sweet water's dimpling laugh from tap or spring;
467,THE GREAT LOVER,Holes in the ground; and voices that do sing;
468,THE GREAT LOVER,"Voices in laughter, too; and body's pain,"
469,THE GREAT LOVER,Soon turned to peace; and the deep-panting train;
470,THE GREAT LOVER,Firm sands; the little dulling edge of foam
471,THE GREAT LOVER,That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home;
472,THE GREAT LOVER,"And washen stones, gay for an hour; the cold"
473,THE GREAT LOVER,Graveness of iron; moist black earthen mould;
474,THE GREAT LOVER,Sleep; and high places; footprints in the dew;
475,THE GREAT LOVER,"And oaks; and brown horse-chestnuts, glossy-new;"
476,THE GREAT LOVER,And new-peeled sticks; and shining pools on grass;--
477,THE GREAT LOVER,"All these have been my loves. And these shall pass,"
478,THE GREAT LOVER,"Whatever passes not, in the great hour,"
479,THE GREAT LOVER,"Nor all my passion, all my prayers, have power"
480,THE GREAT LOVER,To hold them with me through the gate of Death.
481,THE GREAT LOVER,"They'll play deserter, turn with the traitor breath,"
482,THE GREAT LOVER,"Break the high bond we made, and sell Love's trust"
483,THE GREAT LOVER,And sacramented covenant to the dust.
484,THE GREAT LOVER,"--Oh, never a doubt but, somewhere, I shall wake,"
485,THE GREAT LOVER,"And give what's left of love again, and make"
486,THE GREAT LOVER,"New friends, now strangers...."
487,THE GREAT LOVER,"But the best I've known,"
488,THE GREAT LOVER,"Stays here, and changes, breaks, grows old, is blown"
489,THE GREAT LOVER,"About the winds of the world, and fades from brains"
490,THE GREAT LOVER,"Of living men, and dies."
491,THE GREAT LOVER,Nothing remains.
492,THE GREAT LOVER,
493,THE GREAT LOVER,"O dear my loves, O faithless, once again"
494,THE GREAT LOVER,This one last gift I give: that after men
495,THE GREAT LOVER,"Shall know, and later lovers, far-removed,"
496,THE GREAT LOVER,"Praise you, ""All these were lovely""; say, ""He loved."""

907,HOME,"Into my little room,"

909,HOME,And comfortable gloom.
910,HOME,
911,HOME,But as I entered softly in
912,HOME,"I saw a woman there,"
913,HOME,"The line of neck and cheek and chin,"
914,HOME,"The darkness of her hair,"
915,HOME,The form of one I did not know
916,HOME,Sitting in my chair.
917,HOME,
918,HOME,"I stood a moment fierce and still,"
919,HOME,Watching her neck and hair.
920,HOME,I made a step to her; and saw
921,HOME,That there was no one there.
922,HOME,
923,HOME,It was some trick of the firelight
924,HOME,That made me see her there.
925,HOME,It was a chance of shade and light
926,HOME,And the cushion in the chair.
927,HOME,
928,HOME,"Oh, all you happy over the earth,"
929,HOME,"That night, how could I sleep?"

944,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,"Night, smoky-scarv'd, with thousand coloured eyes"

949,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,"Strain for the far, pause, draw to strength again...."
950,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,
951,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,"As a man, caught by some great hour, will rise,"
952,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,"Slow-limbed, to meet the light or find his love;"
953,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,"And, breathing long, with staring sightless eyes,"
954,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,"Hands out, head back, agape and silent, move"
955,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,
956,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,"Sure as a flood, smooth as a vast wind blowing;"
957,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,"And, gathering power and purpose as he goes,"

962,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,"Out of the fire, out of the little room...."
963,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,"--There is an end appointed, O my soul!"
964,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,Crimson and green the signals burn; the gloom
965,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,
966,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,Is hung with steam's far-blowing livid streamers.
967,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,"Lost into God, as lights in light, we fly,"
968,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,"Grown one with will, end-drunken huddled dreamers."
969,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,The white lights roar. The sounds of the world die.
970,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,
971,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,And lips and laughter are forgotten things.
972,THE NIGHT JOURNEY,"Speed sharpens; grows. Into the night, and on,"

1051,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Out of the gold air of the afternoon,"
1052,MARY AND GABRIEL,"One knelt before her: hair he had, or fire,"
1053,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Bound back above his ears with golden wire,"
1054,MARY AND GABRIEL,Baring the eager marble of his face.
1055,MARY AND GABRIEL,Not man's nor woman's was the immortal grace
1056,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Rounding the limbs beneath that robe of white,"
1057,MARY AND GABRIEL,"And lighting the proud eyes with changeless light,"
1058,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Incurious. Calm as his wings, and fair,"
1059,MARY AND GABRIEL,That presence filled the garden.
1060,MARY AND GABRIEL,"She stood there,"
1061,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Saying, ""What would you, Sir?"""
1062,MARY AND GABRIEL,"He told his word,"
1063,MARY AND GABRIEL,"""Blessed art thou of women!"" Half she heard,"
1064,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Hands folded and face bowed, half long had known,"
1065,MARY AND GABRIEL,"The message of that clear and holy tone,"
1066,MARY AND GABRIEL,That fluttered hot sweet sobs about her heart;
1067,MARY AND GABRIEL,Such serene tidings moved such human smart.
1068,MARY AND GABRIEL,Her breath came quick as little flakes of snow.
1069,MARY AND GABRIEL,Her hands crept up her breast. She did but know
1070,MARY AND GABRIEL,It was not hers. She felt a trembling stir
1071,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Within her body, a will too strong for her"
1072,MARY AND GABRIEL,That held and filled and mastered all. With eyes
1073,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Closed, and a thousand soft short broken sighs,"
1074,MARY AND GABRIEL,"She gave submission; fearful, meek, and glad...."
1075,MARY AND GABRIEL,She wished to speak. Under her breasts she had
1076,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Such multitudinous burnings, to and fro,"
1077,MARY AND GABRIEL,And throbs not understood; she did not know
1078,MARY AND GABRIEL,If they were hurt or joy for her; but only
1079,MARY AND GABRIEL,"That she was grown strange to herself, half lonely,"
1080,MARY AND GABRIEL,"All wonderful, filled full of pains to come"
1081,MARY AND GABRIEL,"And thoughts she dare not think, swift thoughts and dumb,"
1082,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Human, and quaint, her own, yet very far,"
1083,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Divine, dear, terrible, familiar..."
1084,MARY AND GABRIEL,Her heart was faint for telling; to relate
1085,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Her limbs' sweet treachery, her strange high estate,"
1086,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Over and over, whispering, half revealing,"
1087,MARY AND GABRIEL,Weeping; and so find kindness to her healing.
1088,MARY AND GABRIEL,"'Twixt tears and laughter, panic hurrying her,"
1089,MARY AND GABRIEL,She raised her eyes to that fair messenger.
1090,MARY AND GABRIEL,"He knelt unmoved, immortal; with his eyes"
1091,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Gazing beyond her, calm to the calm skies;"
1092,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Radiant, untroubled in his wisdom, kind."
1093,MARY AND GABRIEL,His sheaf of lilies stirred not in the wind.
1094,MARY AND GABRIEL,"How should she, pitiful with mortality,"
1095,MARY AND GABRIEL,Try the wide peace of that felicity
1096,MARY AND GABRIEL,"With ripples of her perplexed shaken heart,"
1097,MARY AND GABRIEL,"And hints of human ecstasy, human smart,"
1098,MARY AND GABRIEL,"And whispers of the lonely weight she bore,"
1099,MARY AND GABRIEL,And how her womb within was hers no more
1100,MARY AND GABRIEL,And at length hers?
1101,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Being tired, she bowed her head;"
1102,MARY AND GABRIEL,"And said, ""So be it!"""
1103,MARY AND GABRIEL,The great wings were spread
1104,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Showering glory on the fields, and fire."
1105,MARY AND GABRIEL,"The whole air, singing, bore him up, and higher,"
1106,MARY AND GABRIEL,"Unswerving, unreluctant. Soon he shone"
1107,MARY AND GABRIEL,A gold speck in the gold skies; then was gone.
