117,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,A MAN’S DAUGHTER
118,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,
119,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,
120,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,There is an old woman who looks each night
121,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,Out of the wood.
122,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"She has one tooth, that isn’t too white."
123,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,She isn’t too good.
124,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,
125,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"She came from the north looking for me,"
126,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,About my jewel.
127,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"Her son, she says, is tall as can be;"
128,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"But, men say, cruel."
129,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,
130,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"My girl went northward, holiday making,"
131,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,And a queer man spoke
132,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"At the woodside once when night was breaking,"
133,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,And her heart broke.
134,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,
135,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"For ever since she has pined and pined,"
136,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,A sorry maid;
137,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"Her fingers are slack as the wool they wind,"
138,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,Or her girdle-braid.
139,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,
140,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"So now shall I send her north to wed,"
141,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,Who here may know
142,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,Only the little house of the dead
143,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,To ease her woe?
144,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,
145,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"Or keep her for fear of that old woman,"
146,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"As a bird quick-eyed,"
147,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"And her tall son who is hardly human,"
148,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,At the woodside?
149,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,
150,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"She is my babe and my daughter dear,"
151,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"How well, how well."
152,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"Her grief to me is a fourfold fear,"
153,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,Tongue cannot tell.
154,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,
155,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,And yet I know that far in that wood
156,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"Are crumbling bones,"
157,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"And a mumble mumble of nothing that’s good,"
158,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,In heathen tones.
159,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,
160,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,And I know that frail ghosts flutter and sigh
161,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"In brambles there,"
162,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,And never a bird or beast to cry—
163,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"Beware, beware,—"
164,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,
165,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,While threading the silent thickets go
166,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"Mother and son,"
167,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"Where scrupulous berries never grow,"
168,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,And airs are none.
169,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,
170,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,And her deep eyes peer at eventide
171,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"Out of the wood,"
172,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"And her tall son waits by the dark woodside,"
173,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,For maidenhood.
174,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,
175,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"And the little eyes peer, and peer, and peer;"
176,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,And a word is said.
177,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"And some house knows, for many a year,"
178,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,But years of dread.
179,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,
180,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,

183,VENUS IN ARDEN,VENUS IN ARDEN
184,VENUS IN ARDEN,
185,VENUS IN ARDEN,
186,VENUS IN ARDEN,"Now love, her mantle thrown,"
187,VENUS IN ARDEN,"Goes naked by,"
188,VENUS IN ARDEN,"Threading the woods alone,"
189,VENUS IN ARDEN,Her royal eye
190,VENUS IN ARDEN,Happy because the primroses again
191,VENUS IN ARDEN,Break on the winter continence of men.
192,VENUS IN ARDEN,
193,VENUS IN ARDEN,I saw her pass to-day
194,VENUS IN ARDEN,"In Warwickshire,"
195,VENUS IN ARDEN,"With the old imperial way,"
196,VENUS IN ARDEN,"The old desire,"
197,VENUS IN ARDEN,"Fresh as among those other flowers they went,"
198,VENUS IN ARDEN,More beautiful for Adon’s discontent.
199,VENUS IN ARDEN,
200,VENUS IN ARDEN,Those other years she made
201,VENUS IN ARDEN,Her festival
202,VENUS IN ARDEN,When the blue eggs were laid
203,VENUS IN ARDEN,"And lambs were tall,"
204,VENUS IN ARDEN,By the Athenian rivers while the reeds
205,VENUS IN ARDEN,Made love melodious for the Ganymedes.
206,VENUS IN ARDEN,
207,VENUS IN ARDEN,"And now through Cantlow brakes,"
208,VENUS IN ARDEN,"By Wilmcote hill,"
209,VENUS IN ARDEN,"To Avon-side, she makes"
210,VENUS IN ARDEN,"Her garlands still,"
211,VENUS IN ARDEN,And I who watch her flashing limbs am one
212,VENUS IN ARDEN,With youth whose days three thousand years are done.

218,COTSWOLD LOVE,
219,COTSWOLD LOVE,
220,COTSWOLD LOVE,Blue skies are over Cotswold
221,COTSWOLD LOVE,"And April snows go by,"
222,COTSWOLD LOVE,The lasses turn their ribbons
223,COTSWOLD LOVE,"For April’s in the sky,"
224,COTSWOLD LOVE,And April is the season
225,COTSWOLD LOVE,"When Sabbath girls are dressed,"
226,COTSWOLD LOVE,"From Rodboro’ to Campden,"
227,COTSWOLD LOVE,In all their silken best.
228,COTSWOLD LOVE,
229,COTSWOLD LOVE,An ankle is a marvel
230,COTSWOLD LOVE,"When first the buds are brown,"
231,COTSWOLD LOVE,And not a lass but knows it
232,COTSWOLD LOVE,From Stow to Gloucester town.
233,COTSWOLD LOVE,And not a girl goes walking
234,COTSWOLD LOVE,Along the Cotswold lanes
235,COTSWOLD LOVE,But knows men’s eyes in April
236,COTSWOLD LOVE,Are quicker than their brains.
237,COTSWOLD LOVE,
238,COTSWOLD LOVE,"It’s little that it matters,"
239,COTSWOLD LOVE,"So long as you’re alive,"
240,COTSWOLD LOVE,"If you’re eighteen in April,"
241,COTSWOLD LOVE,"Or rising sixty-five,"
242,COTSWOLD LOVE,When April comes to Amberley
243,COTSWOLD LOVE,"With skies of April blue,"
244,COTSWOLD LOVE,And Cotswold girls are briding
245,COTSWOLD LOVE,With slyly tilted shoe.

250,THE MIDLANDS,THE MIDLANDS
251,THE MIDLANDS,
252,THE MIDLANDS,
253,THE MIDLANDS,Black in the summer night my Cotswold hill
254,THE MIDLANDS,"Aslant my window sleeps, beneath a sky"
255,THE MIDLANDS,Deep as the bedded violets that fill
256,THE MIDLANDS,March woods with dusky passion. As I lie
257,THE MIDLANDS,Abed between cool walls I watch the host
258,THE MIDLANDS,"Of the slow stars lit over Gloucester plain,"
259,THE MIDLANDS,And drowsily the habit of these most
260,THE MIDLANDS,"Beloved of English lands moves in my brain,"
261,THE MIDLANDS,"While silence holds dominion of the dark,"
262,THE MIDLANDS,Save when the foxes from the spinneys bark.
263,THE MIDLANDS,
264,THE MIDLANDS,I see the valleys in their morning mist
265,THE MIDLANDS,"Wreathed under limpid hills in moving light,"
266,THE MIDLANDS,Happy with many a yeoman melodist:
267,THE MIDLANDS,I see the little roads of twinkling white
268,THE MIDLANDS,Busy with fieldward teams and market gear
269,THE MIDLANDS,"Of rosy men, cloth-gaitered, who can tell"
270,THE MIDLANDS,"The many-minded changes of the year,"
271,THE MIDLANDS,Who know why crops and kine fare ill or well;
272,THE MIDLANDS,"I see the sun persuade the mist away,"
273,THE MIDLANDS,Till town and stead are shining to the day.
274,THE MIDLANDS,
275,THE MIDLANDS,I see the wagons move along the rows
276,THE MIDLANDS,"Of ripe and summer-breathing clover-flower,"
277,THE MIDLANDS,I see the lissom husbandman who knows
278,THE MIDLANDS,"Deep in his heart the beauty of his power,"
279,THE MIDLANDS,"As, lithely pitched, the full-heaped fork bids on"
280,THE MIDLANDS,The harvest home. I hear the rickyard fill
281,THE MIDLANDS,"With gossip as in generations gone,"
282,THE MIDLANDS,While wagon follows wagon from the hill.
283,THE MIDLANDS,"I think how, when our seasons all are sealed,"
284,THE MIDLANDS,Shall come the unchanging harvest from the field.
285,THE MIDLANDS,
286,THE MIDLANDS,I see the barns and comely manors planned
287,THE MIDLANDS,"By men who somehow moved in comely thought,"
288,THE MIDLANDS,"Who, with a simple shippon to their hand,"
289,THE MIDLANDS,As men upon some godlike business wrought;
290,THE MIDLANDS,I see the little cottages that keep
291,THE MIDLANDS,Their beauty still where since Plantaganet
292,THE MIDLANDS,"Have come the shepherds happily to sleep,"
293,THE MIDLANDS,Finding the loaves and cups of cider set;
294,THE MIDLANDS,"I see the twisted shepherds, brown and old,"
295,THE MIDLANDS,Driving at dusk their glimmering sheep to fold.
296,THE MIDLANDS,
297,THE MIDLANDS,And now the valleys that upon the sun
298,THE MIDLANDS,"Broke from their opal veils, are veiled again,"
299,THE MIDLANDS,"And the last light upon the wolds is done,"
300,THE MIDLANDS,And silence falls on flocks and fields and men;
301,THE MIDLANDS,"And black upon the night I watch my hill,"
302,THE MIDLANDS,"And the stars shine, and there an owly wing"
303,THE MIDLANDS,"Brushes the night, and all again is still,"
304,THE MIDLANDS,"And, from this land of worship that I sing,"
305,THE MIDLANDS,"I turn to sleep, content that from my sires"
306,THE MIDLANDS,I draw the blood of England’s midmost shires.

313,MAY GARDEN,
314,MAY GARDEN,A shower of green gems on my apple tree
315,MAY GARDEN,This first morning of May
316,MAY GARDEN,"Has fallen out of the night, to be"
317,MAY GARDEN,Herald of holiday—
318,MAY GARDEN,"Bright gems of green that, fallen there,"
319,MAY GARDEN,Seem fixed and glowing on the air.
320,MAY GARDEN,
321,MAY GARDEN,Until a flutter of blackbird wings
322,MAY GARDEN,"Shakes and makes the boughs alive,"
323,MAY GARDEN,"And the gems are now no frozen things,"
324,MAY GARDEN,But apple-green buds to thrive
325,MAY GARDEN,"On sap of my May garden, how well"
326,MAY GARDEN,The green September globes will tell.
327,MAY GARDEN,
328,MAY GARDEN,"Also my pear tree has its buds,"
329,MAY GARDEN,"But they are silver yellow,"
330,MAY GARDEN,Like autumn meadows when the floods
331,MAY GARDEN,"Are silver under willow,"
332,MAY GARDEN,And here shall long and shapely pears
333,MAY GARDEN,Be gathered while the autumn wears.
334,MAY GARDEN,
335,MAY GARDEN,And there are sixty daffodils
336,MAY GARDEN,Beneath my wall....
337,MAY GARDEN,And jealousy it is that kills
338,MAY GARDEN,This world when all
339,MAY GARDEN,The spring’s behaviour here is spent
340,MAY GARDEN,To make the world magnificent.

350,PLOUGH,If we should keep too close a gate.
351,PLOUGH,
352,PLOUGH,Over the woods a splendour falls
353,PLOUGH,"Of death, and grey are the Gloucester walls,"
354,PLOUGH,And grey the skies for burials.
355,PLOUGH,
356,PLOUGH,But secret in the falling snow
357,PLOUGH,"I see the patient ploughman go,"

366,POLITICS,"You say a thousand things,"
367,POLITICS,"Persuasively,"
368,POLITICS,"And with strange passion hotly I agree,"
369,POLITICS,"And praise your zest,"
370,POLITICS,And then
371,POLITICS,A blackbird sings
372,POLITICS,"On April lilac, or fieldfaring men,"
373,POLITICS,"Ghostlike, with loaded wain,"
374,POLITICS,Come down the twilit lane
375,POLITICS,"To rest,"
376,POLITICS,And what is all your argument to me?
377,POLITICS,
378,POLITICS,"Oh yes—I know, I know,"
379,POLITICS,It must be so—
380,POLITICS,You must devise
381,POLITICS,"Your myriad policies,"
382,POLITICS,"For we are little wise,"
383,POLITICS,"And must be led and marshalled, lest we keep"
384,POLITICS,Too fast a sleep
385,POLITICS,Far from the central world’s realities.
386,POLITICS,"Yes, we must heed—"
387,POLITICS,For surely you reveal
388,POLITICS,Life’s very heart; surely with flaming zeal
389,POLITICS,You search our folly and our secret need;
390,POLITICS,And surely it is wrong
391,POLITICS,"To count my blackbird’s song,"
392,POLITICS,"My cones of lilac, and my wagon team,"
393,POLITICS,More than a world of dream.
394,POLITICS,But still
395,POLITICS,A voice calls from the hill—
396,POLITICS,I must away—
397,POLITICS,I cannot hear your argument to-day.

641,REVERIE,REVERIE
642,REVERIE,
643,REVERIE,
644,REVERIE,"Here in the unfrequented noon,"
645,REVERIE,"In the green hermitage of June,"
646,REVERIE,While overhead a rustling wing
647,REVERIE,Minds me of birds that do not sing
648,REVERIE,Until the cooler eve rewakes
649,REVERIE,"The service of melodious brakes,"
650,REVERIE,"And thoughts are lonely rangers, here,"
651,REVERIE,"In shelter of the primrose year,"
652,REVERIE,I curiously meditate
653,REVERIE,Our brief and variable state.
654,REVERIE,
655,REVERIE,I think how many are alive
656,REVERIE,"Who better in the grave would thrive,"
657,REVERIE,If some so long a sleep might give
658,REVERIE,Better instruction how to live;
659,REVERIE,I think what splendours had been said
660,REVERIE,By darlings now untimely dead
661,REVERIE,"Had death been wise in choice of these,"
662,REVERIE,And made exchange of obsequies.
663,REVERIE,
664,REVERIE,I think what loss to government
665,REVERIE,"It is that good men are content,"
666,REVERIE,Well knowing that an evil will
667,REVERIE,"Is folly-stricken too, and still"
668,REVERIE,Itself considers only wise
669,REVERIE,"For all rebukes and surgeries,"
670,REVERIE,That evil men should raise their pride
671,REVERIE,To place and fortune undefied.
672,REVERIE,I think how daily we beguile
673,REVERIE,"Our brains, that yet a little while"
674,REVERIE,And all our congregated schemes
675,REVERIE,"And our perplexity of dreams,"
676,REVERIE,Shall come to whole and perfect state.
677,REVERIE,"I think, however long the date"
678,REVERIE,"Of life may be, at last the sun"
679,REVERIE,Shall pass upon campaigns undone.
680,REVERIE,
681,REVERIE,I look upon the world and see
682,REVERIE,"A world colonial to me,"
683,REVERIE,"Whereof I am the architect,"
684,REVERIE,"And principal and intellect,"
685,REVERIE,A world whose shape and savour spring
686,REVERIE,"Out of my lone imagining,"
687,REVERIE,A world whose nature is subdued
688,REVERIE,"For ever to my instant mood,"
689,REVERIE,And only beautiful can be
690,REVERIE,Because of beauty is in me.
691,REVERIE,And then I know that every mind
692,REVERIE,Among the millions of my kind
693,REVERIE,Makes earth his own particular
694,REVERIE,"And privately created star,"
695,REVERIE,"That earth has thus no single state,"
696,REVERIE,Being every man articulate.
697,REVERIE,Till thought has no horizon then
698,REVERIE,I try to think how many men
699,REVERIE,There are to make an earth apart
700,REVERIE,"In symbol of the urgent heart,"
701,REVERIE,"For there are forty in my street,"
702,REVERIE,"And seven hundred more in Greet,"
703,REVERIE,"And families at Luton Hoo,"
704,REVERIE,"And there are men in China, too."
705,REVERIE,
706,REVERIE,And what immensity is this
707,REVERIE,That is but a parenthesis
708,REVERIE,"Set in a little human thought,"
709,REVERIE,Before the body comes to naught.
710,REVERIE,There at the bottom of the copse
711,REVERIE,"I see a field of turnip tops,"
712,REVERIE,I see the cropping cattle pass
713,REVERIE,"There in another field, of grass,"
714,REVERIE,"And fields and fields, with seven towns,"
715,REVERIE,"A river, and a flight of downs,"
716,REVERIE,"Steeples for all religious men,"
717,REVERIE,"Ten thousand trees, and orchards ten,"
718,REVERIE,A mighty span that curves away
719,REVERIE,"Into blue beauty, and I lay"
720,REVERIE,All this as quartered on a sphere
721,REVERIE,"Hung huge in space, a thing of fear"
722,REVERIE,Vast as the circle of the sky
723,REVERIE,Completed to the astonished eye;
724,REVERIE,"And then I think that all I see,"
725,REVERIE,Whereof I frame immensity
726,REVERIE,"Globed for amazement, is no more"
727,REVERIE,"Than a shire’s corner, and that four"
728,REVERIE,Great shires being ten times multiplied
729,REVERIE,Are small on the Atlantic tide
730,REVERIE,As an emerald on a silver bowl ...
731,REVERIE,And the Atlantic to the whole
732,REVERIE,Sweep of this tributary star
733,REVERIE,That is our earth is but ... and far
734,REVERIE,Through dreadful space the outmeasured mind
735,REVERIE,Seeks to conceive the unconfined.
736,REVERIE,
737,REVERIE,"I think of Time. How, when his wing"
738,REVERIE,Composes all our quarrelling
739,REVERIE,In some green corner where May leaves
740,REVERIE,"Are loud with blackbirds on all eves,"
741,REVERIE,And all the dust that was our bones
742,REVERIE,"Is underneath memorial stones,"
743,REVERIE,"Then shall old jealousies, while we"
744,REVERIE,"Lie side by side most quietly,"
745,REVERIE,"Be but oblivion’s fools, and still"
746,REVERIE,When curious pilgrims ask—‘What skill
747,REVERIE,Had these that from oblivion saves?’—
748,REVERIE,My song shall sing above our graves.
749,REVERIE,
750,REVERIE,"I think how men of gentle mind,"
751,REVERIE,"And friendly will, and honest kind,"
752,REVERIE,Deny their nature and appear
753,REVERIE,Fellows of jealousy and fear;
754,REVERIE,"Having single faith, and natural wit"
755,REVERIE,"To measure truth and cherish it,"
756,REVERIE,"Yet, strangely, when they build in thought,"
757,REVERIE,Twisting the honesty that wrought
758,REVERIE,"In the straight motion of the heart,"
759,REVERIE,Into its feigning counterpart
760,REVERIE,That is the brain’s betrayal of
761,REVERIE,The simple purposes of love;
762,REVERIE,And what yet sorrier decline
763,REVERIE,"Is theirs when, eager to confine"
764,REVERIE,No more within the silent brain
765,REVERIE,"Its habit, thought seeks birth again"
766,REVERIE,"In speech, as honesty has done"
767,REVERIE,In thought; then even what had won
768,REVERIE,From heart to brain fades and is lost
769,REVERIE,"In this pretended pentecost,"
770,REVERIE,This their forlorn captivity
771,REVERIE,"To speech, who have not learnt to be"
772,REVERIE,"Lords of the word, nor kept among"
773,REVERIE,The sterner climates of the tongue ...
774,REVERIE,"So truth is in their hearts, and then"
775,REVERIE,"Falls to confusion in the brain,"
776,REVERIE,"And, fading through this mid-eclipse,"
777,REVERIE,It perishes upon the lips.
778,REVERIE,
779,REVERIE,I think how year by year I still
780,REVERIE,Find working in my dauntless will
781,REVERIE,Sudden timidities that are
782,REVERIE,Merely the echo of some far
783,REVERIE,Forgotten tyrannies that came
784,REVERIE,To youth’s bewilderment and shame;
785,REVERIE,"That yet a magisterial gown,"
786,REVERIE,Being worn by one of no renown
787,REVERIE,And half a generation less
788,REVERIE,"In years than I, can dispossess"
789,REVERIE,Something my circumspecter mood
790,REVERIE,"Of excellence and quietude,"
791,REVERIE,And if a Bishop speaks to me
792,REVERIE,I tremble with propriety.
793,REVERIE,
794,REVERIE,I think how strange it is that he
795,REVERIE,Who goes most comradely with me
796,REVERIE,"In beauty’s worship, takes delight"
797,REVERIE,In shows that to my eager sight
798,REVERIE,"Are shadows and unmanifest,"
799,REVERIE,While beauty’s favour and behest
800,REVERIE,To me in motion are revealed
801,REVERIE,That is against his vision sealed;
802,REVERIE,Yet is our hearts’ necessity
803,REVERIE,"Not twofold, but a common plea"
804,REVERIE,"That chaos come to continence,"
805,REVERIE,Whereto the arch-intelligence
806,REVERIE,Richly in divers voices makes
807,REVERIE,Its answer for our several sakes.
808,REVERIE,
809,REVERIE,I see the disinherited
810,REVERIE,"And long procession of the dead,"
811,REVERIE,Who have in generations gone
812,REVERIE,Held fugitive dominion
813,REVERIE,Of this same primrose pasturage
814,REVERIE,That is my momentary wage.
815,REVERIE,I see two lovers move along
816,REVERIE,"These shadowed silences of song,"
817,REVERIE,With spring in blossom at their feet
818,REVERIE,More incommunicably sweet
819,REVERIE,"To their hearts’ more magnificence,"
820,REVERIE,"Than to the common courts of sense,"
821,REVERIE,Till joy his tardy closure tells
822,REVERIE,With coming of the curfew bells.
823,REVERIE,I see the knights of spur and sword
824,REVERIE,"Crossing the little woodland ford,"
825,REVERIE,Riding in ghostly cavalcade
826,REVERIE,On some unchronicled crusade.
827,REVERIE,I see the silent hunter go
828,REVERIE,"In cloth of yeoman green, with bow"
829,REVERIE,"Strung, and a quiver of grey wings."
830,REVERIE,I see the little herd who brings
831,REVERIE,"His cattle homeward, while his sire"
832,REVERIE,Makes bivouac in Warwickshire
833,REVERIE,"This night, the liege and loyal man"
834,REVERIE,Of Cavalier or Puritan.
835,REVERIE,"And as they pass, the nameless dead,"
836,REVERIE,"Unsung, uncelebrate, and sped"
837,REVERIE,Upon an unremembered hour
838,REVERIE,"As any twelvemonth fallen flower,"
839,REVERIE,I think how strangely yet they live
840,REVERIE,For all their days were fugitive.
841,REVERIE,
842,REVERIE,I think how soon we too shall be
843,REVERIE,A story with our ancestry.
844,REVERIE,
845,REVERIE,I think what miracle has been
846,REVERIE,That you whose love among this green
847,REVERIE,Delightful solitude is still
848,REVERIE,"The stay and substance of my will,"
849,REVERIE,"The dear custodian of my song,"
850,REVERIE,"My thrifty counsellor and strong,"
851,REVERIE,Should take the time of all time’s tide
852,REVERIE,"That was my season, to abide"
853,REVERIE,On earth also; that we should be
854,REVERIE,Charted across eternity
855,REVERIE,To one elect and happy day
856,REVERIE,Of yellow primroses in May.
857,REVERIE,
858,REVERIE,"The clock is calling five o’clock,"
859,REVERIE,And Nonesopretty brings her flock
860,REVERIE,"To fold, and Tom comes back from town"
861,REVERIE,"With hose and ribbons worth a crown,"
862,REVERIE,And duly at The Old King’s Head
863,REVERIE,"They gather now to daily bread,"
864,REVERIE,And I no more may meditate
865,REVERIE,Our brief and variable state.
