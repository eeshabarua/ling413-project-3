890,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,
891,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,"Oh yes, I know the way to heaven was easy."
892,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,We found the little kingdom of our passion
893,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,That all can share who walk the road of lovers.
894,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,In wild and secret happiness we stumbled;
895,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,And gods and demons clamoured in our senses.
896,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,
897,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,But I've grown thoughtful now.  And you have lost
898,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,Your early-morning freshness of surprise
899,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,At being so utterly mine: you've learned to fear
900,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,"The gloomy, stricken places in my soul,"
901,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,And the occasional ghosts that haunt my gaze.
902,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,
903,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,You made me glad; and I can still return
904,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,"To you, the haven of my lonely pride:"
905,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,But I am sworn to murder those illusions
906,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,That blossom from desire with desperate beauty:
907,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,And there shall be no falsehood in our failure;
908,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,"Since, if we loved like beasts, the thing is done,"
909,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,"And I'll not hide it, though our heaven be hell."
910,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,
911,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,You dream long liturgies of our devotion.
912,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,"Yet, in my heart, I dread our love's destruction."
913,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,"But, should you grow to hate me, I would ask"
914,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,No mercy of your mood: I'd have you stand
915,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,"And look me in the eyes, and laugh, and smite me."
916,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,
917,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,"Then I should know, at least, that truth endured,"
918,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,Though love had died of wounds.  And you could leave me
919,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,Unvanquished in my atmosphere of devils.
920,THE IMPERFECT LOVER,

928,VISION,"Winds, birds, and glittering leaves that flare and fall--"
929,VISION,They fling delight across the world; they call
930,VISION,To rhythmic-flashing limbs that rove and race...
931,VISION,A moment in the dawn for Youth's lit face;

941,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,I have been wrung with anger and compassion for you.
942,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,"I wonder if you'd loathe my pity, if you knew."
943,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,
944,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,But you _shall_ know.  I've carried in my heart too long
945,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,This secret burden.  Has not silence wrought _your_ wrong--
946,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,"Brought you to dumb and wintry middle-age, with grey"
947,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,"Unfruitful withering?--Ah, the pitiless things I say..."
948,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,

957,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,That wounds your life; I see you humbled to adore
958,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,The painted miracle you've never understood.
959,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,"Tender, and bitter-sweet, and shy, I've watched you holding"
960,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,"Another's child.  O childless woman, was it then"
961,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,"That, with an instant's cry, your heart, made young again,"
962,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,Was crucified for ever--those poor arms enfolding
963,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,"The life, the consummation that had been denied you?"
964,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,"I too have longed for children.  Ah, but you must not weep."
965,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,Something I have to whisper as I kneel beside you...
966,TO A CHILDLESS WOMAN,And you must pray for me before you fall asleep.

1012,FALLING ASLEEP,Thud of feet and a muffled shutting of doors:
1013,FALLING ASLEEP,Everyone yawning ... only the clocks are alert.
1014,FALLING ASLEEP,
1015,FALLING ASLEEP,Out in the night there's autumn-smelling gloom
1016,FALLING ASLEEP,"Crowded with whispering trees,--looming of oaks"
1017,FALLING ASLEEP,That roared in wild wet gales: across the park
1018,FALLING ASLEEP,The hollow cry of hounds like lonely bells:
1019,FALLING ASLEEP,"And I know that the clouds are moving across the moon,"
1020,FALLING ASLEEP,"The low, red, rising moon."
1021,FALLING ASLEEP,The herons call
1022,FALLING ASLEEP,And wrangle by their pool; and hooting owls
1023,FALLING ASLEEP,Sail from the wood across pale stocks of wheat.
1024,FALLING ASLEEP,
1025,FALLING ASLEEP,"Waiting for sleep, I drift from thoughts like these;"
1026,FALLING ASLEEP,"And where to-day was dream-like, build my dreams."

1028,FALLING ASLEEP,"And someone singing a song about a soldier,--"
1029,FALLING ASLEEP,"One hour, two hours ago; and soon the song"
1030,FALLING ASLEEP,Will be 'last night': but now the beauty swings
1031,FALLING ASLEEP,"Across my brain, ghost of remember'd chords"
1032,FALLING ASLEEP,Which still can make such radiance in my dream
1033,FALLING ASLEEP,"That I can watch the marching of my soldiers,"
1034,FALLING ASLEEP,And count their faces; faces; sunlit faces.
1035,FALLING ASLEEP,
1036,FALLING ASLEEP,"Falling asleep ... the herons, and the hounds..."

1045,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,You like my bird-sung gardens: wings and flowers;
1046,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,Calm landscapes for emotion; star-lit lawns;
1047,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,And Youth against the sun-rise ...  '_Not profound;_

1050,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,
1051,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,Last night I dreamt an old recurring scene--
1052,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,"Some complex out of childhood; (sex, of course!)"
1053,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,I can't remember how the trouble starts;
1054,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,And then I'm running blindly in the sun
1055,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,"Down the old orchard, and there's something cruel"
1056,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,Chasing me; someone roused to a grim pursuit
1057,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,Of clumsy anger ...  Crash!  I'm through the fence
1058,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,And thrusting wildly down the wood that's dense
1059,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,With woven green of safety; paths that wind
1060,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,"Moss-grown from glade to glade; and far behind,"
1061,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,One thwarted yell; then silence.  I've escaped.
1062,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,
1063,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,That's where it used to stop.  Last night I went
1064,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,"Onward until the trees were dark and huge,"
1065,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,"And I was lost, cut off from all return"
1066,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,By swamps and birdless jungles.  I'd no chance
1067,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,"Of getting home for tea.  I woke with shivers,"
1068,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,And thought of crocodiles in crawling rivers.
1069,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,
1070,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,Some day I'll build (more ruggedly than Doughty)
1071,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,A dark tremendous song you'll never hear.
1072,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,"My beard will be a snow-storm, drifting whiter"
1073,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,"On bowed, prophetic shoulders, year by year."
1074,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,"And some will say, 'His work has grown so dreary.'"
1075,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,"Others, 'He used to be a charming writer.'"
1076,PRELUDE TO AN UNWRITTEN MASTERPIECE,"And you, my friend, will query--"
