63,PREFACE,PREFACE
64,PREFACE,
65,PREFACE,
66,PREFACE,"It is a perilous adventure--the writing of a preface, however brief, to"
67,PREFACE,one’s own poems. For one may be tempted to re-state matters that could
68,PREFACE,find their full elucidation only in the verses themselves. Tennyson once
69,PREFACE,"remarked that poetry is like shot silk, glancing with many colours; and"
70,PREFACE,any attempt to define its meanings is as great a mistake as the attempt
71,PREFACE,of nineteenth-century materialism to enclose the infinite universe in
72,PREFACE,"its logical nut-shells. Through poetry alone, whether of deeds or words,"
73,PREFACE,"thought or colour, passion or marble, is it possible to approach the"
74,PREFACE,"Infinite, or as Blake did:--"
75,PREFACE,
76,PREFACE,"‘To see a world in a grain of sand,"
77,PREFACE,A heaven in a wild flower;
78,PREFACE,"Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand,"
79,PREFACE,And Eternity in an hour.’
80,PREFACE,
81,PREFACE,But this revelation is the sole end and object of all true art; and I
82,PREFACE,hope it may not be thought presumptuous to say here simply
83,PREFACE,that--whether the attempt be a success or a failure--it was especially
84,PREFACE,my own aim in the two following poems. If the feet of childhood are set
85,PREFACE,"dancing in them, it was because as children we are best able to enter"
86,PREFACE,"into that Kingdom of Dreams which is also the only true, the only real,"
87,PREFACE,"Kingdom. The first tale, for instance, must not be taken to have any"
88,PREFACE,real relation to Japan. It belongs--as the _Spectator_ put it--to the
89,PREFACE,kind of dreamland which an imaginative child might construct out of the
90,PREFACE,"oddities of a willow-pattern plate, and it differs chiefly from"
91,PREFACE,Wonderlands of the Lewis Carrol type in a certain seriousness behind its
92,PREFACE,fantasy. It is astonishing to me that these things require comment; but
93,PREFACE,"undoubtedly they do. For, on the one hand, the first tale has been"
94,PREFACE,"praised enthusiastically as a vivid picture of Japan, and the author has"
95,PREFACE,"not only had to correspond with Tokyo on the subject, but was also"
96,PREFACE,"invited to meetings of the Japan Society in London! On the other hand,"
97,PREFACE,because the child-voices are allowed to declare that Tusitala lies
98,PREFACE,"asleep in that distant country of dreams, a prosaic English critic once"
99,PREFACE,wrote a lengthy review in an important paper to point out my gross
100,PREFACE,ignorance of the fact that Stevenson was really buried in Samoa! The
101,PREFACE,tales are ‘such stuff as dreams are made on’; but--as a kinder critic
102,PREFACE,has remarked--‘we ourselves are made of that stuff.’ It is perhaps
103,PREFACE,because these poems are almost light enough for a nonsense-book that I
104,PREFACE,"feel there is something in them more elemental, more essential, more"
105,PREFACE,"worthy of serious consideration, than the most ponderous philosophical"
106,PREFACE,poem I could write. They are based on the fundamental and very simple
107,PREFACE,"mystery of the universe--that anything, even a grain of sand, should"
108,PREFACE,"exist at all. If we could understand that, we could understand"
109,PREFACE,"everything! Set clear of all irrelevancies, that is the simple problem"
110,PREFACE,that has been puzzling all the ages; and it is well sometimes to forget
111,PREFACE,our accumulated ‘knowledge’ and return to it in all its childish
112,PREFACE,"_naïveté_. It is well to face that inconceivable miracle, that"
113,PREFACE,"fundamental impossibility which happens to have been possible, that"
114,PREFACE,"contradiction in terms, that fundamental paradox, for which we have at"
115,PREFACE,"best only a cruciform symbol, with its arms pointing in opposite"
116,PREFACE,"directions and postulating, at once, an infinite God."
117,PREFACE,
118,PREFACE,The inscription on the “Wisdom Looking-Glass”; the discovery by the
119,PREFACE,children that the self-limitation of their little wishes was necessary
120,PREFACE,"not only to their own happiness, but to the harmony of the whole world;"
121,PREFACE,the development of the same idea in the passages leading up to the
122,PREFACE,song--_What does it take to make a rose?_--where a _divine_ act of
123,PREFACE,"loving self-limitation, an eternal self-sacrifice, an everlasting"
124,PREFACE,"passion of the Godhead, such as perhaps was shadowed forth on Calvary,"
125,PREFACE,"is found to be at the heart of the Universe, and to be--as it were--the"
126,PREFACE,"highest aspect of the Paradox aforesaid, the living secret and price of"
127,PREFACE,our very existence; these things are only one twisted strand of the
128,PREFACE,‘shot silk’ out of which the two tales are woven. It is no new wisdom to
129,PREFACE,regard these things through the eyes of little children; and I
130,PREFACE,know--however insignificant they may be to others--these two tales
131,PREFACE,"contain as deep and true things as I, personally, have the power to"
132,PREFACE,"express. I hope, therefore, that I may be pardoned, in these hurried"
133,PREFACE,"days, for pointing out that the two poems are not to be taken merely as"
134,PREFACE,"fairy-tales, but as an attempt to follow the careless and happy feet of"
135,PREFACE,"childhood back into the kingdom of those dreams which, as we said above,"
136,PREFACE,"are the sole reality worth living and dying for; those beautiful dreams,"
137,PREFACE,or those fantastic jests--if any care to call them so--for which mankind
138,PREFACE,has endured so many triumphant martyrdoms that even amidst the rush and
139,PREFACE,roar of modern materialism they cannot be quite forgotten.

165,PRELUDE,You that have known the wonder zone
166,PRELUDE,Of islands far away;
167,PRELUDE,You that have heard the dinky bird
168,PRELUDE,And roamed in rich Cathay;
169,PRELUDE,You that have sailed o’er unknown seas
170,PRELUDE,To woods of Amfalula trees
171,PRELUDE,Where craggy dragons play:
172,PRELUDE,"Oh, girl or woman, boy or man,"
173,PRELUDE,You’ve plucked the Flower of Old Japan!
174,PRELUDE,
175,PRELUDE,Do you remember the blue stream;
176,PRELUDE,The bridge of pale bamboo;
177,PRELUDE,The path that seemed a twisted dream
178,PRELUDE,Where everything came true;
179,PRELUDE,The purple cherry-trees; the house
180,PRELUDE,With jutting eaves below the boughs;
181,PRELUDE,"The mandarins in blue,"
182,PRELUDE,"With tiny, tapping, tilted toes,"
183,PRELUDE,And curious curved mustachios?
184,PRELUDE,
185,PRELUDE,"_The road to Old Japan!_ you cry,"
186,PRELUDE,_And is it far or near?_
187,PRELUDE,Some never find it till they die;
188,PRELUDE,Some find it everywhere;
189,PRELUDE,The road where restful Time forgets
190,PRELUDE,His weary thoughts and wild regrets
191,PRELUDE,And calls the golden year
192,PRELUDE,Back in a fairy dream to smile
193,PRELUDE,On young and old a little while.
194,PRELUDE,
195,PRELUDE,"Some seek it with a blazing sword,"
196,PRELUDE,And some with old blue plates;
197,PRELUDE,Some with a miser’s golden hoard;
198,PRELUDE,Some with a book of dates;
199,PRELUDE,Some with a box of paints; a few
200,PRELUDE,Whose loads of truth would ne’er pass through
201,PRELUDE,"The first, white, fairy gates;"
202,PRELUDE,"And, oh, how shocked they are to find"
203,PRELUDE,That truths are false when left behind!
204,PRELUDE,
205,PRELUDE,Do you remember all the tales
206,PRELUDE,"That Tusitala told,"
207,PRELUDE,When first we plunged thro’ purple vales
208,PRELUDE,In quest of buried gold?
209,PRELUDE,Do you remember how he said
210,PRELUDE,That if we fell and hurt our head
211,PRELUDE,"Our hearts must still be bold,"
212,PRELUDE,And we must never mind the pain
213,PRELUDE,But rise up and go on again?
214,PRELUDE,
215,PRELUDE,Do you remember? yes; I know
216,PRELUDE,You must remember still:
217,PRELUDE,"He left us, not so long ago,"
218,PRELUDE,"Carolling with a will,"
219,PRELUDE,Because he knew that he should lie
220,PRELUDE,Under the comfortable sky
221,PRELUDE,"Upon a lonely hill,"
222,PRELUDE,"In Old Japan, when day was done;"
223,PRELUDE,“Dear Robert Louis Stevenson.”
224,PRELUDE,
225,PRELUDE,And there he knew that he should find
226,PRELUDE,The hills that haunt us now;
227,PRELUDE,The whaups that cried upon the wind
228,PRELUDE,His heart remembered how;
229,PRELUDE,"And friends he loved and left, to roam"
230,PRELUDE,"Far from the pleasant hearth of home,"
231,PRELUDE,Should touch his dreaming brow;
232,PRELUDE,"Where fishes fly and birds have fins,"
233,PRELUDE,And children teach the mandarins.
234,PRELUDE,
235,PRELUDE,"Ah, let us follow, follow far"
236,PRELUDE,Beyond the purple seas;
237,PRELUDE,"Beyond the rosy foaming bar,"
238,PRELUDE,"The coral reef, the trees,"
239,PRELUDE,"The land of parrots, and the wild"
240,PRELUDE,That rolls before the fearless child
241,PRELUDE,Its ancient mysteries:
242,PRELUDE,"Onward and onward, if we can,"
243,PRELUDE,To Old Japan--to Old Japan.

252,EMBARKATION,
253,EMBARKATION,"When the firelight, red and clear,"
254,EMBARKATION,"Flutters in the black wet pane,"
255,EMBARKATION,It is very good to hear
256,EMBARKATION,Howling winds and trotting rain:
257,EMBARKATION,"It is very good indeed,"
258,EMBARKATION,"When the nights are dark and cold,"
259,EMBARKATION,Near the friendly hearth to read
260,EMBARKATION,Tales of ghosts and buried gold.
261,EMBARKATION,
262,EMBARKATION,So with cosy toes and hands
263,EMBARKATION,"We were dreaming, just like you;"
264,EMBARKATION,Till we thought of palmy lands
265,EMBARKATION,Coloured like a cockatoo;
266,EMBARKATION,All in drowsy nursery nooks
267,EMBARKATION,"Near the clutching fire we sat,"
268,EMBARKATION,Searching quaint old story-books
269,EMBARKATION,Piled upon the furry mat.
270,EMBARKATION,
271,EMBARKATION,Something haunted us that night
272,EMBARKATION,Like a half-remembered name;
273,EMBARKATION,Worn old pages in that light
274,EMBARKATION,"Seemed the same, yet not the same:"
275,EMBARKATION,Curling in the pleasant heat
276,EMBARKATION,"Smoothly as a shell-shaped fan,"
277,EMBARKATION,O! they breathed and smelt so sweet
278,EMBARKATION,When we turned to Old Japan!
279,EMBARKATION,
280,EMBARKATION,Suddenly we thought we heard
281,EMBARKATION,"Someone tapping on the wall,"
282,EMBARKATION,"Tapping, tapping like a bird,"
283,EMBARKATION,Till a panel seemed to fall
284,EMBARKATION,Quietly; and a tall thin man
285,EMBARKATION,"Stepped into the glimmering room,"
286,EMBARKATION,"And he held a little fan,"
287,EMBARKATION,And he waved it in the gloom.
288,EMBARKATION,
289,EMBARKATION,"Curious reds, and golds, and greens"
290,EMBARKATION,"Danced before our startled eyes,"
291,EMBARKATION,"Birds from painted Indian screens,"
292,EMBARKATION,"Beads, and shells, and dragon-flies;"
293,EMBARKATION,"Wings, and flowers, and scent, and flame,"
294,EMBARKATION,Fans and fish and heliotrope;
295,EMBARKATION,Till the magic air became
296,EMBARKATION,Like a dream kaleidoscope.
297,EMBARKATION,
298,EMBARKATION,Then he told us of a land
299,EMBARKATION,Far across a fairy sea;
300,EMBARKATION,And he waved his thin white hand
301,EMBARKATION,"Like a flower, melodiously;"
302,EMBARKATION,While a red and blue macaw
303,EMBARKATION,"Perched upon his pointed head,"
304,EMBARKATION,"And as in a dream, we saw"
305,EMBARKATION,All the curious things he said.
306,EMBARKATION,
307,EMBARKATION,"Tucked in tiny palanquins,"
308,EMBARKATION,"Magically swinging there,"
309,EMBARKATION,Flowery-kirtled mandarins
310,EMBARKATION,Floated through the scented air;
311,EMBARKATION,Wandering dogs and prowling cats
312,EMBARKATION,Grinned at fish in painted lakes;
313,EMBARKATION,Cross-legged conjurers on mats
314,EMBARKATION,Fluted low to listening snakes.
315,EMBARKATION,
316,EMBARKATION,Fat black bonzes on the shore
317,EMBARKATION,"Watched where singing, faint and far,"
318,EMBARKATION,Boys in long blue garments bore
319,EMBARKATION,Roses in a golden jar.
320,EMBARKATION,While at carven dragon ships
321,EMBARKATION,"Floating o’er that silent sea,"
322,EMBARKATION,Squat-limbed gods with dreadful lips
323,EMBARKATION,Leered and smiled mysteriously.
324,EMBARKATION,
325,EMBARKATION,"Like an idol, shrined alone,"
326,EMBARKATION,"Watched by secret oval eyes,"
327,EMBARKATION,Where the ruby wishing-stone
328,EMBARKATION,"Smouldering in the darkness lies,"
329,EMBARKATION,Anyone that wanted things
330,EMBARKATION,Touched the jewel and they came:
331,EMBARKATION,We were wealthier than kings
332,EMBARKATION,If we could but do the same.
333,EMBARKATION,
334,EMBARKATION,Yes; we knew a hundred ways
335,EMBARKATION,We might use it if we could;
336,EMBARKATION,To be happy all our days
337,EMBARKATION,As an Indian in a wood;
338,EMBARKATION,"No more daily lesson task,"
339,EMBARKATION,"No more sorrow, no more care;"
340,EMBARKATION,So we thought that we would ask
341,EMBARKATION,If he’d kindly lead us there.
342,EMBARKATION,
343,EMBARKATION,"Ah! but then he waved his fan,"
344,EMBARKATION,And he vanished through the wall;
345,EMBARKATION,"Yet as in a dream, we ran"
346,EMBARKATION,"Tumbling after, one and all;"
347,EMBARKATION,"Never pausing once to think,"
348,EMBARKATION,Panting after him we sped;
349,EMBARKATION,For we saw his robe of pink
350,EMBARKATION,Floating backward as he fled.
351,EMBARKATION,
352,EMBARKATION,"Down a secret passage deep,"
353,EMBARKATION,"Under roofs of spidery stairs,"
354,EMBARKATION,"Where the bat-winged nightmares creep,"
355,EMBARKATION,And a sheeted phantom glares
356,EMBARKATION,Rushed we; ah! how strange it was
357,EMBARKATION,Where no human watcher stood;
358,EMBARKATION,Till we reached a gate of glass
359,EMBARKATION,Opening on a flowery wood.
360,EMBARKATION,
361,EMBARKATION,"Where the rose-pink robe had flown,"
362,EMBARKATION,"Borne by swifter feet than ours,"
363,EMBARKATION,"On to Wonder-Wander town,"
364,EMBARKATION,Through the wood of monstrous flowers;
365,EMBARKATION,Mailed in monstrous gold and blue
366,EMBARKATION,Dragon-flies like peacocks fled;
367,EMBARKATION,"Butterflies like carpets, too,"
368,EMBARKATION,Softly fluttered overhead.
369,EMBARKATION,
370,EMBARKATION,"Down the valley, tip-a-toe,"
371,EMBARKATION,Where the broad-limbed giants lie
372,EMBARKATION,"Snoring, as when long ago"
373,EMBARKATION,Jack on a bean-stalk scaled the sky;
374,EMBARKATION,"Slowly, softly towards the town"
375,EMBARKATION,"Stole we past old dreams again,"
376,EMBARKATION,"Castles long since battered down,"
377,EMBARKATION,Dungeons of forgotten pain.
378,EMBARKATION,
379,EMBARKATION,"Noonday brooded on the wood,"
380,EMBARKATION,Evening caught us ere we crept
381,EMBARKATION,"Where a twisted pear-tree stood,"
382,EMBARKATION,And a dwarf behind it slept;
383,EMBARKATION,"Round his scraggy throat he wore,"
384,EMBARKATION,"Knotted tight, a scarlet scarf;"
385,EMBARKATION,"Timidly we watched him snore,"
386,EMBARKATION,For he seemed a surly dwarf.
387,EMBARKATION,
388,EMBARKATION,"Yet, he looked so very small,"
389,EMBARKATION,He could hardly hurt us much;
390,EMBARKATION,"We were nearly twice as tall,"
391,EMBARKATION,So we woke him with a touch
392,EMBARKATION,"Gently, and in tones polite,"
393,EMBARKATION,Asked him to direct our path;
394,EMBARKATION,O! his wrinkled eyes grew bright
395,EMBARKATION,Green with ugly gnomish wrath.
396,EMBARKATION,
397,EMBARKATION,"He seemed to choke,"
398,EMBARKATION,"And gruffly spoke,"
399,EMBARKATION,"“You’re lost: deny it, if you can!"
400,EMBARKATION,You want to know
401,EMBARKATION,The way to go?
402,EMBARKATION,There’s no such place as Old Japan.
403,EMBARKATION,
404,EMBARKATION,“You want to seek--
405,EMBARKATION,"No, no, don’t speak!"
406,EMBARKATION,You mean you want to steal a fan.
407,EMBARKATION,You want to see
408,EMBARKATION,The fields of tea?
409,EMBARKATION,They don’t grow tea in Old Japan.
410,EMBARKATION,
411,EMBARKATION,"“In China, well"
412,EMBARKATION,Perhaps you’d smell
413,EMBARKATION,The cherry bloom: that’s if you ran
414,EMBARKATION,A million miles
415,EMBARKATION,"And jumped the stiles,"
416,EMBARKATION,And never dreamed of Old Japan.
417,EMBARKATION,
418,EMBARKATION,"“What, palanquins,"
419,EMBARKATION,And mandarins?
420,EMBARKATION,"And, what d’you say, a blue divan?"
421,EMBARKATION,And what? Hee! hee!
422,EMBARKATION,You’ll never see
423,EMBARKATION,A pig-tailed head in Old Japan.
424,EMBARKATION,
425,EMBARKATION,“You’d take away
426,EMBARKATION,"The ruby, hey?"
427,EMBARKATION,I never heard of such a plan!
428,EMBARKATION,Upon my word
429,EMBARKATION,It’s quite absurd
430,EMBARKATION,There’s not a gem in Old Japan!
431,EMBARKATION,
432,EMBARKATION,"“Oh, dear me, no!"
433,EMBARKATION,You’d better go
434,EMBARKATION,"Straight home again, my little man:"
435,EMBARKATION,"Ah, well, you’ll see"
436,EMBARKATION,But don’t blame me;
437,EMBARKATION,I don’t believe in Old Japan.”
438,EMBARKATION,
439,EMBARKATION,"Then, before we could obey,"
440,EMBARKATION,"O’er our startled heads he cast,"
441,EMBARKATION,"Spider-like, a webby grey"
442,EMBARKATION,Net that held us prisoned fast;
443,EMBARKATION,"How we screamed, he only grinned,"
444,EMBARKATION,It was such a lonely place;
445,EMBARKATION,And he said we should be pinned
446,EMBARKATION,In his human beetle-case.
447,EMBARKATION,
448,EMBARKATION,Out he dragged a monstrous box
449,EMBARKATION,From a cave behind the tree!
450,EMBARKATION,"It had four-and-twenty locks,"
451,EMBARKATION,"But he could not find the key,"
452,EMBARKATION,And his face grew very pale
453,EMBARKATION,When a sudden voice began
454,EMBARKATION,"Drawing nearer through the vale,"
455,EMBARKATION,Singing songs of Old Japan.

462,SONG,
463,SONG,_Satin sails in a crimson dawn_
464,SONG,_Over the silky silver sea;_
465,SONG,_Purple veils of the dark withdrawn;_
466,SONG,_Heavens of pearl and porphyry;_
467,SONG,_Purple and white in the morning light_
468,SONG,"_Over the water the town we knew,_"
469,SONG,"_In tiny state, like a willow-plate,_"
470,SONG,"_Shone, and behind it the hills were blue._"
471,SONG,
472,SONG,"_There, we remembered, the shadows pass_"
473,SONG,_All day long like dreams in the night;_
474,SONG,"_There, in the meadows of dim blue grass,_"
475,SONG,_Crimson daisies are ringed with white;_
476,SONG,"_There the roses flutter their petals,_"
477,SONG,"_Over the meadows they take their flight,_"
478,SONG,_There the moth that sleepily settles_
479,SONG,_Turns to a flower in the warm soft light._
480,SONG,
481,SONG,_There when the sunset colours the streets_
482,SONG,_Everyone buys at wonderful stalls_
483,SONG,"_Toys and chocolates, guns and sweets,_"
484,SONG,"_Ivory pistols, and Persian shawls:_"
485,SONG,_Everyone’s pockets are crammed with gold;_
486,SONG,"_Nobody’s heart is worn with care,_"
487,SONG,"_Nobody ever grows tired and old,_"
488,SONG,_And nobody calls you “Baby” there._
489,SONG,
490,SONG,_There with a hat like a round white dish_
491,SONG,"_Upside down on each pig-tailed head,_"
492,SONG,"_Jugglers offer you snakes and fish,_"
493,SONG,_Dreams and dragons and gingerbread;_
494,SONG,"_Beautiful books with marvellous pictures,_"
495,SONG,"_Painted pirates and streaming gore,_"
496,SONG,"_And everyone reads, without any strictures,_"
497,SONG,_Tales he remembers for evermore._
498,SONG,
499,SONG,_There when the dim blue daylight lingers_
500,SONG,"_Listening, and the West grows holy,_"
501,SONG,_Singers crouch with their long white fingers_
502,SONG,_Floating over the zithern slowly:_
503,SONG,_Paper lamps with a peachy bloom_
504,SONG,"_Burn above on the dim blue bough,_"
505,SONG,_While the zitherns gild the gloom_
506,SONG,_With curious music! I hear it now!_
507,SONG,
508,SONG,_Now_: and at that mighty word
509,SONG,"Holding out his magic fan,"
510,SONG,"Through the waving flowers appeared,"
511,SONG,"Suddenly, the tall thin man:"
512,SONG,And we saw the crumpled dwarf
513,SONG,"Trying to hide behind the tree,"
514,SONG,But his knotted scarlet scarf
515,SONG,Made him very plain to see.
516,SONG,
517,SONG,Like a soft and smoky cloud
518,SONG,Passed the webby net away;
519,SONG,While its owner squealing loud
520,SONG,Down behind the pear-tree lay;
521,SONG,"For the tall thin man came near,"
522,SONG,"And his words were dark and gruff,"
523,SONG,And he swung the dwarf in the air
524,SONG,By his long and scraggy scruff.
525,SONG,
526,SONG,There he kickled whimpering.
527,SONG,"But our rescuer touched the box,"
528,SONG,Open with a sudden spring
529,SONG,Clashed the four-and-twenty locks;
530,SONG,"Then he crammed the dwarf inside,"
531,SONG,And the locks all clattered tight:
532,SONG,Four-and-twenty times he tried
533,SONG,Whether they were fastened right.
534,SONG,
535,SONG,"Ah, he led us on our road,"
536,SONG,Showed us Wonder-Wander town;
537,SONG,Then he fled: behind him flowed
538,SONG,Once again the rose-pink gown:
539,SONG,"Down the long deserted street,"
540,SONG,"All the windows winked like eyes,"
541,SONG,And our little trotting feet
542,SONG,Echoed to the starry skies.
543,SONG,
544,SONG,Low and long for evermore
545,SONG,Where the Wonder-Wander sea
546,SONG,Whispers to the wistful shore
547,SONG,"Purple songs of mystery,"
548,SONG,Down the shadowy quay we came--
549,SONG,Though it hides behind the hill
550,SONG,You will find it just the same
551,SONG,And the seamen singing still.
552,SONG,
553,SONG,"There we chose a ship of pearl,"
554,SONG,And her milky silken sail
555,SONG,"Seemed by magic to unfurl,"
556,SONG,Puffed before a fairy gale;
557,SONG,"Shimmering o’er the purple deep,"
558,SONG,"Out across the silvery bar,"
559,SONG,Softly as the wings of sleep
560,SONG,Sailed we towards the morning star.
561,SONG,
562,SONG,"Over us the skies were dark,"
563,SONG,Yet we never needed light;
564,SONG,Softly shone our tiny bark
565,SONG,Gliding through the solemn night;
566,SONG,"Softly bright our moony gleam,"
567,SONG,"Glimmered o’er the glistening waves,"
568,SONG,Like a cold sea-maiden’s dream
569,SONG,Globed in twilit ocean caves.
570,SONG,
571,SONG,So all night our shallop passed
572,SONG,"Many a haunt of old desire,"
573,SONG,Blurs of savage blossom massed
574,SONG,Red above a pirate-fire;
575,SONG,Huts that gloomed and glanced among
576,SONG,Fruitage dipping in the blue;
577,SONG,"Songs the sirens never sung,"
578,SONG,Shores Ulysses never knew.
579,SONG,
580,SONG,All our fairy rigging shone
581,SONG,Richly as a rainbow seen
582,SONG,Where the moonlight floats upon
583,SONG,Gossamers of gold and green:
584,SONG,All the tiny spars were bright;
585,SONG,Beaten gold the bowsprit was;
586,SONG,"But our pilot was the night,"
587,SONG,And our chart a looking-glass.

594,THE ARRIVAL,THE ARRIVAL
595,THE ARRIVAL,
596,THE ARRIVAL,
597,THE ARRIVAL,With rosy finger-tips the Dawn
598,THE ARRIVAL,"Drew back the silver veils,"
599,THE ARRIVAL,Till lilac shimmered into lawn
600,THE ARRIVAL,Above the satin sails;
601,THE ARRIVAL,"And o’er the waters, white and wan,"
602,THE ARRIVAL,"In tiny patterned state,"
603,THE ARRIVAL,We saw the streets of Old Japan
604,THE ARRIVAL,"Shine, like a willow plate."
605,THE ARRIVAL,
606,THE ARRIVAL,"O, many a milk-white pigeon roams"
607,THE ARRIVAL,"The purple cherry crops,"
608,THE ARRIVAL,"The mottled miles of pearly domes,"
609,THE ARRIVAL,"And blue pagoda tops,"
610,THE ARRIVAL,The river with its golden canes
611,THE ARRIVAL,"And dark piratic dhows,"
612,THE ARRIVAL,To where beyond the twisting vanes
613,THE ARRIVAL,The burning mountain glows.
614,THE ARRIVAL,
615,THE ARRIVAL,A snow-peak in the silver skies
616,THE ARRIVAL,"Beyond that magic world,"
617,THE ARRIVAL,We saw the great volcano rise
618,THE ARRIVAL,"With incense o’er it curled,"
619,THE ARRIVAL,Whose tiny thread of rose and blue
620,THE ARRIVAL,"Has risen since time began,"
621,THE ARRIVAL,Before the first enchanter knew
622,THE ARRIVAL,The peak of Old Japan.
623,THE ARRIVAL,
624,THE ARRIVAL,Nobody watched us quietly steer
625,THE ARRIVAL,"The pinnace to the painted pier,"
626,THE ARRIVAL,"Except one pig-tailed mandarin,"
627,THE ARRIVAL,Who sat upon a chest of tea
628,THE ARRIVAL,Pretending not to hear or see!...
629,THE ARRIVAL,"His hands were very long and thin,"
630,THE ARRIVAL,His face was very broad and white;
631,THE ARRIVAL,"And O, it was a fearful sight"
632,THE ARRIVAL,To see him sit alone and grin!
633,THE ARRIVAL,
634,THE ARRIVAL,His grin was very sleek and sly:
635,THE ARRIVAL,Timidly we passed him by!
636,THE ARRIVAL,He did not seem at all to care:
637,THE ARRIVAL,"So, thinking we were safely past,"
638,THE ARRIVAL,We ventured to look back at last.
639,THE ARRIVAL,"O, dreadful blank!--_He was not there!_"
640,THE ARRIVAL,He must have hid behind his chest:
641,THE ARRIVAL,We did not stay to see the rest.
642,THE ARRIVAL,
643,THE ARRIVAL,"But, as in reckless haste we ran,"
644,THE ARRIVAL,"We came upon the tall thin man,"
645,THE ARRIVAL,"Who called to us and waved his fan,"
646,THE ARRIVAL,And offered us his palanquin:
647,THE ARRIVAL,He said we must not go alone
648,THE ARRIVAL,"To seek the ruby wishing-stone,"
649,THE ARRIVAL,Because the white-faced mandarin
650,THE ARRIVAL,"Would dog our steps for many a mile,"
651,THE ARRIVAL,And sit upon each purple stile
652,THE ARRIVAL,"Before we came to it, and smile"
653,THE ARRIVAL,And smile; his name was Creeping Sin.
654,THE ARRIVAL,
655,THE ARRIVAL,"He played with children’s beating hearts,"
656,THE ARRIVAL,And stuck them full of poisoned darts
657,THE ARRIVAL,And long green thorns that stabbed and stung:
658,THE ARRIVAL,"He’d watch until we tried to speak,"
659,THE ARRIVAL,Then thrust inside his pasty cheek
660,THE ARRIVAL,"His long, white, slimy tongue:"
661,THE ARRIVAL,And smile at everything we said;
662,THE ARRIVAL,"And sometimes pat us on the head,"
663,THE ARRIVAL,And say that we were very young:
664,THE ARRIVAL,He was a cousin of the man
665,THE ARRIVAL,Who said that there was no Japan.
666,THE ARRIVAL,
667,THE ARRIVAL,And night and day this Creeping Sin
668,THE ARRIVAL,Would follow the path of the palanquin;
669,THE ARRIVAL,Yet if we still were fain to touch
670,THE ARRIVAL,"The ruby, we must have no fear,"
671,THE ARRIVAL,"Whatever we might see or hear,"
672,THE ARRIVAL,And the tall thin man would take us there;
673,THE ARRIVAL,"He did not fear that Sly One much,"
674,THE ARRIVAL,"Except perhaps on a moonless night,"
675,THE ARRIVAL,Nor even then if the stars were bright.
676,THE ARRIVAL,
677,THE ARRIVAL,"So, in the yellow palankeen"
678,THE ARRIVAL,We swung along in state between
679,THE ARRIVAL,Twinkling domes of gold and green
680,THE ARRIVAL,"Through the rich bazaar,"
681,THE ARRIVAL,"Where the cross-legged merchants sat,"
682,THE ARRIVAL,"Old and almond-eyed and fat,"
683,THE ARRIVAL,"Each upon a gorgeous mat,"
684,THE ARRIVAL,Each in a cymar;
685,THE ARRIVAL,"Each in crimson samite breeches,"
686,THE ARRIVAL,Watching his barbaric riches.
687,THE ARRIVAL,
688,THE ARRIVAL,Cherry blossom breathing sweet
689,THE ARRIVAL,Whispered o’er the dim blue street
690,THE ARRIVAL,Where with fierce uncertain feet
691,THE ARRIVAL,Tawny pirates walk:
692,THE ARRIVAL,"All in belts and baggy blouses,"
693,THE ARRIVAL,"Out of dreadful opium houses,"
694,THE ARRIVAL,"Out of dens where Death carouses,"
695,THE ARRIVAL,Horribly they stalk;
696,THE ARRIVAL,"Girt with ataghan and dagger,"
697,THE ARRIVAL,Right across the road they swagger.
698,THE ARRIVAL,
699,THE ARRIVAL,"And where the cherry orchards blow,"
700,THE ARRIVAL,"We saw the maids of Miyako,"
701,THE ARRIVAL,Swaying softly to and fro
702,THE ARRIVAL,Through the dimness of the dance:
703,THE ARRIVAL,Like sweet thoughts that shine through dreams
704,THE ARRIVAL,"They glided, wreathing rosy gleams,"
705,THE ARRIVAL,"With stately sounds of silken streams,"
706,THE ARRIVAL,And many a slim kohl-lidded glance;
707,THE ARRIVAL,Then fluttered with tiny rose-bud feet
708,THE ARRIVAL,To a soft _frou-frou_ and a rhythmic beat
709,THE ARRIVAL,"As the music shimmered, pursuit, retreat,"
710,THE ARRIVAL,"“Hands across, retire, advance!”"
711,THE ARRIVAL,And again it changed and the glimmering throng
712,THE ARRIVAL,Faded into a distant song.
713,THE ARRIVAL,
714,THE ARRIVAL,
715,THE ARRIVAL,
716,THE ARRIVAL,
717,SONG,SONG
718,SONG,
719,SONG,
720,SONG,_The maidens of Miyako_
721,SONG,"_Dance in the sunset hours,_"
722,SONG,"_Deep in the sunset glow,_"
723,SONG,_Under the cherry flowers._
724,SONG,
725,SONG,_With dreamy hands of pearl_
726,SONG,"_Floating like butterflies,_"
727,SONG,_Dimly the dancers whirl_
728,SONG,_As the rose light dies;_
729,SONG,
730,SONG,"_And their floating gowns, their hair_"
731,SONG,"_Upbound with curious pins,_"
732,SONG,_Fade thro’ the darkening air_
733,SONG,_With the dancing mandarins._
734,SONG,
735,SONG,"And then, as we went, the tall thin man"
736,SONG,Explained the manners of Old Japan;
737,SONG,"If you pitied a thing, you pretended to sneer;"
738,SONG,Yet if you were glad you ran to buy
739,SONG,A captive pigeon and let it fly;
740,SONG,"And, if you were sad, you took a spear"
741,SONG,"To wound yourself, for fear your pain"
742,SONG,Should quietly grow less again.
743,SONG,
744,SONG,"And, again he said, if we wished to find"
745,SONG,The mystic City that enshrined
746,SONG,"The stone so few on earth had found,"
747,SONG,We must be very brave; it lay
748,SONG,"A hundred haunted leagues away,"
749,SONG,"Past many a griffon-guarded ground,"
750,SONG,"In depths of dark and curious art,"
751,SONG,Where passion-flowers enfold apart
752,SONG,"The Temple of the Flaming Heart,"
753,SONG,The City of the Secret Wound.
754,SONG,
755,SONG,About the fragrant fall of day
756,SONG,We saw beside the twisted way
757,SONG,"A blue-domed tea-house, bossed with gold;"
758,SONG,Hungry and thirsty we entered in:
759,SONG,How should we know what Creeping Sin
760,SONG,Had breathed in that Emperor’s ear who sold
761,SONG,His own dumb soul for an evil jewel
762,SONG,"To the earth-gods, blind and ugly and cruel?..."
763,SONG,"We drank sweet tea as his tale was told,"
764,SONG,"In a garden of blue chrysanthemums,"
765,SONG,While a drowsy swarming of gongs and drums
766,SONG,Out of the sunset dreamily rolled.
767,SONG,
768,SONG,"But, as the murmur nearer drew,"
769,SONG,"A fat black bonze, in a robe of blue,"
770,SONG,Suddenly at the gate appeared;
771,SONG,"And close behind, with that evil grin,"
772,SONG,"_Was it Creeping Sin, was it Creeping Sin?_"
773,SONG,The bonze looked quietly down and sneered.
774,SONG,"Our guide! Was he sleeping? We could not wake him,"
775,SONG,However we tried to pinch and shake him!
776,SONG,
777,SONG,"Nearer, nearer the tumult came,"
778,SONG,"Till, as a glare of sound and flame,"
779,SONG,Blind from a terrible furnace door
780,SONG,"Blares, or the mouth of a dragon, blazed"
781,SONG,The seething gateway: deaf and dazed
782,SONG,With the clanging and the wild uproar
783,SONG,We stood; while a thousand oval eyes
784,SONG,Gapped our fear with a sick surmise.
785,SONG,
786,SONG,"Then, as the dead sea parted asunder,"
787,SONG,The clamour clove with a sound of thunder
788,SONG,In two great billows; and all was quiet.
789,SONG,Gaunt and black was the palankeen
790,SONG,That came in dreadful state between
791,SONG,The frozen waves of the wild-eyed riot
792,SONG,Curling back from the breathless track
793,SONG,Of the Nameless One who is never seen:
794,SONG,The close drawn curtains were thick and black;
795,SONG,But wizen and white was the tall thin man
796,SONG,As he rose in his sleep:
797,SONG,"His eyes were closed, his lips were wan,"
798,SONG,He crouched like a leopard that dares not leap.
799,SONG,
800,SONG,"The bearers halted: the tall thin man,"
801,SONG,"Fearfully dreaming, waved his fan,"
802,SONG,"With wizard fingers, to and fro;"
803,SONG,"While, with a whimper of evil glee,"
804,SONG,The Nameless Emperor’s mad Moonshee
805,SONG,Stepped in front of us: dark and slow
806,SONG,Were the words of the doom that he dared not name;
807,SONG,"But, over the ground, as he spoke, there came"
808,SONG,Tiny circles of soft blue flame;
809,SONG,"Like ghosts of flowers they began to glow,"
810,SONG,And flow like a moonlit brook between
811,SONG,Our feet and the terrible palankeen.
812,SONG,
813,SONG,"But the Moonshee wrinkled his long thin eyes,"
814,SONG,"And sneered, “Have you stolen the strength of the skies?"
815,SONG,Then pour before us a stream of pearl!
816,SONG,"Give us the pearl and the gold we know,"
817,SONG,And our hearts will be softened and let you go;
818,SONG,But these are toys for a foolish girl--
819,SONG,These vanishing blossoms--what are they worth?
820,SONG,They are not so heavy as dust and earth:
821,SONG,Pour before us a stream of pearl!”
822,SONG,
823,SONG,"Then, with a wild strange laugh, our guide"
824,SONG,Stretched his arms to the West and cried
825,SONG,"Once, and a song came over the sea;"
826,SONG,And all the blossoms of moon-soft fire
827,SONG,"Woke and breathed as a wind-swept lyre,"
828,SONG,And the garden surged into harmony;
829,SONG,"Till it seemed that the soul of the whole world sung,"
830,SONG,And every petal became a tongue
831,SONG,To tell the thoughts of Eternity.
832,SONG,
833,SONG,But the Moonshee lifted his painted brows
834,SONG,And stared at the gold on the blue tea-house:
835,SONG,“Can you clothe your body with dreams?” he sneered;
836,SONG,“If you taught us the truths that we always know
837,SONG,Our heart might be softened and let you go:
838,SONG,"Can you tell us the length of a monkey’s beard,"
839,SONG,"Or the weight of the gems on the Emperor’s fan,"
840,SONG,Or the number of parrots in Old Japan?”
841,SONG,"And again, with a wild strange laugh, our guide"
842,SONG,"Looked at him; and he shrunk aside,"
843,SONG,Shrivelling like a flame-touched leaf;
844,SONG,For the red-cross blossoms of soft blue fire
845,SONG,"Were growing and fluttering higher and higher,"
846,SONG,"Shaking their petals out, sheaf by sheaf,"
847,SONG,Till with disks like shields and stems like towers
848,SONG,Burned the host of the passion-flowers
849,SONG,... Had the Moonshee flown like a midnight thief?
850,SONG,"... Yet a thing like a monkey, shrivelled and black,"
851,SONG,Chattered and danced as they forced him back.
852,SONG,
853,SONG,"As the coward chatters for empty pride,"
854,SONG,"In the face of a foe that he cannot but fear,"
855,SONG,"It chattered and leapt from side to side,"
856,SONG,And its voice rang strangely upon the ear.
857,SONG,As the cry of a wizard that dares not own
858,SONG,Another’s brighter and mightier throne;
859,SONG,As the wrath of a fool that rails aloud
860,SONG,On the fire that burnt him; the brazen bray
861,SONG,"Clamoured and sang o’er the gaping crowd,"
862,SONG,And flapped like a gabbling goose away.
863,SONG,
864,SONG,
865,SONG,
866,SONG,
867,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE
868,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,
869,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"_If the blossoms were beans,"
870,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,I should know what it means--
871,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"This blaze, which I certainly cannot endure;"
872,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"It is evil, too,"
873,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"For its colour is blue,"
874,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,And the sense of the matter is quite obscure.
875,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Celestial truth
876,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Is the food of youth;
877,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,But the music was dark as a moonless night._
878,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,_The facts in the song
879,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"Were all of them wrong,"
880,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,And there was not a single sum done right;
881,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"Tho’ a metaphysician amongst the crowd,"
882,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"In a voice that was notably deep and loud,"
883,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"Repeated, as fast as he was able,"
884,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,The whole of the multiplication table._
885,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,
886,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"So the cry flapped off as a wild goose flies,"
887,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"And the stars came out in the trembling skies,"
888,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,And ever the mystic glory grew
889,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"In the garden of blue chrysanthemums,"
890,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Till there came a rumble of distant drums;
891,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,And the multitude suddenly turned and flew.
892,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,... A dead ape lay where their feet had been ...
893,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"And we called for the yellow palankeen,"
894,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,And the flowers divided and let us through.
895,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,The black-barred moon was large and low
896,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,When we came to the Forest of Ancient Woe;
897,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,And over our heads the stars were bright.
898,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,But through the forest the path we travelled
899,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Its phosphorescent aisle unravelled
900,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,In one thin ribbon of dwindling light:
901,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,And twice and thrice on the fainting track
902,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"We paused to listen. The moon grew black,"
903,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"But the coolies’ faces glimmered white,"
904,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,As the wild woods echoed in dreadful chorus
905,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,A laugh that came horribly hopping o’er us
906,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Like monstrous frogs thro’ the murky night.
907,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,
908,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Then the tall thin man as we swung along
909,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Sang us an old enchanted song
910,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,That lightened our hearts of their fearful load.
911,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"But, e’en as the moonlit air grew sweet,"
912,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,We heard the pad of stealthy feet
913,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Dogging us down the thin white road;
914,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"And the song grew weary again and harsh,"
915,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"And the black trees dripped like the fringe of a marsh,"
916,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,And a laugh crept out like a shadowy toad;
917,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,And we knew it was neither ghoul nor djinn:
918,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,_It was Creeping Sin! It was Creeping Sin!_
919,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,
920,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"But we came to a bend, and the white moon glowed"
921,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Like a gate at the end of the narrowing road
922,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"Far away; and on either hand,"
923,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"As guards of a path to the heart’s desire,"
924,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,The strange tall blossoms of soft blue fire
925,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"Stretched away thro’ that unknown land,"
926,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,League on league with their dwindling lane
927,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,Down to the large low moon; and again
928,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,"There shimmered around us that mystical strain,"
929,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,In a tongue that it seemed we could understand.

962,SONG,They stripe themselves with red and black

980,SONG,As we came to the great black Tower of Apes:
981,SONG,But we gave them purple figs and grapes
982,SONG,In alabaster amphoras:
983,SONG,We gave them curious kinds of fruit
984,SONG,"With betel nuts and orris-root,"
985,SONG,And then they let us pass:
986,SONG,And when we reached the Tower of Snakes
987,SONG,"We gave them soft white honey-cakes,"
988,SONG,And warm sweet milk in bowls of brass:
989,SONG,And on the hundredth eve we found
990,SONG,The City of the Secret Wound.

992,SONG,We saw the mystic blossoms blow

994,SONG,Faintly in the sunset glow
995,SONG,We saw the soft blue glory flow

998,SONG,"Of tamarisks and tulip-trees,"
999,SONG,Domes like golden oranges
1000,SONG,Dream aloft elate.

1026,THE MYSTIC RUBY,THE MYSTIC RUBY
1027,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1028,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1029,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The white moon dawned; the sunset died;
1030,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And stars were trembling when we spied
1031,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The rose-red temple of our dreams:
1032,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Its lamp-lit gardens glimmered cool
1033,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"With many an onyx-paven pool,"
1034,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Amid soft sounds of flowing streams;
1035,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Where star-shine shimmered through the white
1036,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Tall fountain-shafts of crystal light
1037,THE MYSTIC RUBY,In ever changing rainbow-gleams.
1038,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1039,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Priests in flowing yellow robes
1040,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Glided under rosy globes;
1041,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Through the green pomegranate boughs
1042,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Moonbeams poured their coloured rain;
1043,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Roofs of sea-green porcelain
1044,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Jutted o’er the rose-red house;
1045,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Bells were hung beneath its eaves;
1046,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Every wind that stirred the leaves
1047,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Tinkled as tired water does.
1048,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1049,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The temple had a low broad base
1050,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Of black bright marble; all its face
1051,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Was marble bright in rosy bloom;
1052,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And where two sea-green pillars rose
1053,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Deep in the flower-soft eave-shadows
1054,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"We saw, thro’ richly sparkling gloom,"
1055,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Wrought in marvellous years of old
1056,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"With bulls and peacocks bossed in gold,"
1057,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The doors of powdered lacquer loom.
1058,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1059,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Quietly then the tall thin man,"
1060,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Holding his turquoise-tinted fan,"
1061,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Alighted from the palanquin;
1062,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We followed: never painter dreamed
1063,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Of how that dark rich temple gleamed
1064,THE MYSTIC RUBY,With gules of jewelled gloom within;
1065,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And as we wondered near the door
1066,THE MYSTIC RUBY,A priest came o’er the polished floor
1067,THE MYSTIC RUBY,In sandals of soft serpent-skin;
1068,THE MYSTIC RUBY,His mitre shimmered bright and blue
1069,THE MYSTIC RUBY,With pigeon’s breast-plumes. When he knew
1070,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Our quest he stroked his broad white chin,"
1071,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And looked at us with slanting eyes
1072,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And smiled; then through his deep disguise
1073,THE MYSTIC RUBY,_We knew him! It was Creeping Sin!_
1074,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1075,THE MYSTIC RUBY,But cunningly he bowed his head
1076,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Down on his gilded breast and said
1077,THE MYSTIC RUBY,_Come_: and he led us through the dusk
1078,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Of passages whose painted walls
1079,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Gleamed with dark old festivals;
1080,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Till where the gloom grew sweet with musk
1081,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And incense, through a door of amber"
1082,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We came into a high-arched chamber.
1083,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1084,THE MYSTIC RUBY,There on a throne of jasper sat
1085,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"A monstrous idol, black and fat;"
1086,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Thick rose-oil dropped upon its head:
1087,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Drop by drop, heavy and sweet,"
1088,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Trickled down to its ebon feet
1089,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Whereon the blood of goats was shed,"
1090,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And smeared around its perfumed knees
1091,THE MYSTIC RUBY,In savage midnight mysteries.
1092,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1093,THE MYSTIC RUBY,It wore about its bulging waist
1094,THE MYSTIC RUBY,A belt of dark green bronze enchased
1095,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"With big, soft, cloudy pearls; its wrists"
1096,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Were clasped about with moony gems
1097,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Gathered from dead kings’ diadems;
1098,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Its throat was ringed with amethysts,"
1099,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And in its awful hand it held
1100,THE MYSTIC RUBY,A softly smouldering emerald.
1101,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1102,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Silkily murmured Creeping Sin,"
1103,THE MYSTIC RUBY,“This is the stone you wished to win!”
1104,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"“White Snake,” replied the tall thin man,"
1105,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"“Show us the Ruby Stone, or I"
1106,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Will slay thee with my hands.” The sly
1107,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Long eyelids of the priest began
1108,THE MYSTIC RUBY,To slant aside; and then once more
1109,THE MYSTIC RUBY,He led us through the fragrant door.
1110,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1111,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And now along the passage walls
1112,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Were painted hideous animals,"
1113,THE MYSTIC RUBY,With hooded eyes and cloven stings:
1114,THE MYSTIC RUBY,In the incense that like shadowy hair
1115,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Streamed over them they seemed to stir
1116,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Their craggy claws and crooked wings.
1117,THE MYSTIC RUBY,At last we saw strange moon-wreaths curl
1118,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Around a deep, soft porch of pearl."
1119,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1120,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"O, what enchanter wove in dreams"
1121,THE MYSTIC RUBY,That chapel wild with shadowy gleams
1122,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And prismy colours of the moon?
1123,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Shrined like a rainbow in a mist
1124,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Of flowers, the fretted amethyst"
1125,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Arches rose to a mystic tune;
1126,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And never mortal art inlaid
1127,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Those cloudy floors of sea-soft jade.
1128,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1129,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"There, in the midst, an idol rose"
1130,THE MYSTIC RUBY,White as the silent starlit snows
1131,THE MYSTIC RUBY,On lonely Himalayan heights:
1132,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Over its head the spikenard spilled
1133,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Down to its feet, with myrrh distilled"
1134,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"In distant, odorous Indian nights:"
1135,THE MYSTIC RUBY,It held before its ivory face
1136,THE MYSTIC RUBY,A flaming yellow chrysoprase.
1137,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1138,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"O, silkily murmured Creeping Sin,"
1139,THE MYSTIC RUBY,“This is the stone you wished to win.”
1140,THE MYSTIC RUBY,But in his ear the tall thin man
1141,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"_Whispered with slow, strange lips_--we knew"
1142,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Not what, but Creeping Sin went blue"
1143,THE MYSTIC RUBY,With fear; again his eyes began
1144,THE MYSTIC RUBY,To slant aside; then through the porch
1145,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"He passed, and lit a tall, brown torch."
1146,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1147,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Down a corridor dark as death,"
1148,THE MYSTIC RUBY,With beating hearts and bated breath
1149,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We hurried; far away we heard
1150,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"A dreadful hissing, fierce as fire"
1151,THE MYSTIC RUBY,When rain begins to quench a pyre;
1152,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And where the smoky torch-light flared
1153,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Strange vermin beat their bat-like wings,"
1154,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And the wet walls dropped with slimy things.
1155,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1156,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And darker, darker, wound the way,"
1157,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Beyond all gleams of night and day,"
1158,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And still that hideous hissing grew
1159,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Louder and louder on our ears,"
1160,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And tortured us with eyeless fears;
1161,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Then suddenly the gloom turned blue,"
1162,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And, in the wall, a rough rock cave"
1163,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Gaped, like a phosphorescent grave."
1164,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1165,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And from the purple mist within
1166,THE MYSTIC RUBY,There came a wild tumultuous din
1167,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Of snakes that reared their heads and
1168,THE MYSTIC RUBY,hissed
1169,THE MYSTIC RUBY,As if a witch’s cauldron boiled;
1170,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"All round the door great serpents coiled,"
1171,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"With eyes of glowing amethyst,"
1172,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Whose fierce blue flames began to slide
1173,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Like shooting stars from side to side.
1174,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1175,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Ah! with a sickly gasping grin
1176,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And quivering eyelids, Creeping Sin"
1177,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Stole to the cave; but, suddenly,"
1178,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"As through its glimmering mouth he passed,"
1179,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The serpents flashed and gripped him fast:
1180,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"He wriggled and gave one awful cry,"
1181,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Then all at once the cave was cleared;
1182,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The snakes with their victim had disappeared.
1183,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1184,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And fearlessly the tall thin man
1185,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Opened his turquoise-tinted fan
1186,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And entered; and the mists grew bright,"
1187,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And we saw that the cave was a diamond hall
1188,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Lit with lamps for a festival.
1189,THE MYSTIC RUBY,A myriad globes of coloured light
1190,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Went gliding deep in its massy sides,"
1191,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Like the shimmering moons in the glassy tides
1192,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Where a sea-king’s palace enchants the night.
1193,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1194,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Gliding and flowing, a glory and wonder,"
1195,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Through each other, and over, and under,"
1196,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"The lucent orbs of green and gold,"
1197,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Bright with sorrow or soft with sleep,"
1198,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"In music through the glimmering deep,"
1199,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Over their secret axles rolled,"
1200,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And circled by the murmuring spheres
1201,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We saw in a frame of frozen tears
1202,THE MYSTIC RUBY,A mirror that made the blood run cold.
1203,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1204,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"For, when we came to it, we found"
1205,THE MYSTIC RUBY,It imaged everything around
1206,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Except the face that gazed in it;
1207,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And where the mirrored face should be
1208,THE MYSTIC RUBY,A heart-shaped Ruby fierily
1209,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Smouldered; and round the frame was writ,"
1210,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"_Mystery: Time and Tide shall pass,"
1211,THE MYSTIC RUBY,I am the Wisdom Looking-Glass._
1212,THE MYSTIC RUBY,_This is the Ruby none can touch:
1213,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Many have loved it overmuch;
1214,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Its fathomless fires flutter and sigh,"
1215,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Being as images of the flame
1216,THE MYSTIC RUBY,That shall make earth and heaven the same
1217,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"When the fire of the end reddens the sky,"
1218,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And the world consumes like a burning pall,"
1219,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Till where there is nothing, there is all._"
1220,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1221,THE MYSTIC RUBY,So we looked up at the tall thin man
1222,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And we saw that his face grew sad and wan:
1223,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Tears were glistening in his eyes:
1224,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"At last, with a breaking sob, he bent"
1225,THE MYSTIC RUBY,His head upon his breast and went
1226,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Swiftly away! With dreadful cries
1227,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We rushed to the softly glimmering door
1228,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And stared at the hideous corridor
1229,THE MYSTIC RUBY,But his robe was gone as a dream that flies:
1230,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Back to the glass in terror we came,"
1231,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And stared at the writing round the frame.
1232,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1233,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We could not understand one word:
1234,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And suddenly we thought we heard
1235,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The hissing of the snakes again:
1236,THE MYSTIC RUBY,How could we front them all alone?
1237,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"O, madly we clutched at the mirrored stone"
1238,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And wished we were back on the flowery plain:
1239,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And swifter than thought and swift as fear
1240,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"The whole world flashed, and behold we were there."
1241,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1242,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Yes; there was the port of Old Japan,"
1243,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"With its twisted patterns, white and wan,"
1244,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Shining like a mottled fan
1245,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"Spread by the blue sea, faint and far;"
1246,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And far away we heard once more
1247,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"A sound of singing on the shore,"
1248,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Where boys in blue kimonos bore
1249,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Roses in a golden jar:
1250,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And we heard, where the cherry orchards blow,"
1251,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"The serpent-charmers fluting low,"
1252,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And the song of the maidens of Miyako.
1253,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1254,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And at our feet unbroken lay
1255,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The glass that had whirled us thither away:
1256,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And in the grass, among the flowers"
1257,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We sat and wished all sorts of things:
1258,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"O, we were wealthier than kings!"
1259,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We ruled the world for several hours!
1260,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And then, it seemed, we knew not why,"
1261,THE MYSTIC RUBY,All the daisies began to die.
1262,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1263,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We wished them alive again; but soon
1264,THE MYSTIC RUBY,The trees all fled up towards the moon
1265,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Like peacocks through the sunlit air:
1266,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And the butterflies flapped into silver fish;
1267,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And each wish spoiled another wish;
1268,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Till we threw the glass down in despair;
1269,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"For, getting whatever you want to get,"
1270,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Is like drinking tea from a fishing net.
1271,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1272,THE MYSTIC RUBY,At last we thought we’d wish once more
1273,THE MYSTIC RUBY,That all should be as it was before;
1274,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And then we’d shatter the glass, if we could;"
1275,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"But just as the world grew right again,"
1276,THE MYSTIC RUBY,We heard a wanderer out on the plain
1277,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Singing what none of us understood;
1278,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Yet we thought that the world grew thrice more sweet
1279,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And the meadows were blossoming under his feet.
1280,THE MYSTIC RUBY,
1281,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And we felt a grand and beautiful fear,"
1282,THE MYSTIC RUBY,For we knew that a marvellous thought drew near;
1283,THE MYSTIC RUBY,So we kept the glass for a little while:
1284,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And the skies grew deeper and twice as bright,"
1285,THE MYSTIC RUBY,"And the seas grew soft as a flower of light,"
1286,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And the meadows rippled from stile to stile;
1287,THE MYSTIC RUBY,And memories danced in a musical throng
1288,THE MYSTIC RUBY,Thro’ the blossom that scented the wonderful song.

1331,THE END OF THE QUEST,Like the dawn upon a dream
1332,THE END OF THE QUEST,Slowly through the scented gloom

1334,THE END OF THE QUEST,O’er the friendly nursery room.
1335,THE END OF THE QUEST,"There, before our waking eyes,"

1343,THE END OF THE QUEST,Told us we were home again;
1344,THE END OF THE QUEST,For a soft and curious light
1345,THE END OF THE QUEST,"Suddenly was o’er it shed,"
1346,THE END OF THE QUEST,And we saw it was a white

1348,THE END OF THE QUEST,
1349,THE END OF THE QUEST,"Slowly, as a wavering mist"
1350,THE END OF THE QUEST,"Waned the wonder out of sight,"
1351,THE END OF THE QUEST,"To a sigh of amethyst,"
1352,THE END OF THE QUEST,To a wraith of scented light.
1353,THE END OF THE QUEST,Flower and magic glass had gone;
1354,THE END OF THE QUEST,Near the clutching fire we sat
1355,THE END OF THE QUEST,"Dreaming, dreaming, all alone,"
1356,THE END OF THE QUEST,Each upon a furry mat.

1358,THE END OF THE QUEST,"While the firelight, red and clear,"

1361,THE END OF THE QUEST,Howling winds and trotting rain.
1362,THE END OF THE QUEST,For we found at last we knew

1456,PRELUDE,"And taken him away again, our merry little Peterkin;"

1459,PRELUDE,

1516,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Now father stood engaged in talk
1517,THE SPLENDID SECRET,With mother on that narrow walk
1518,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Between the laurels (where we play
1519,THE SPLENDID SECRET,At Red-skins lurking for their prey)
1520,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And the grey old wall of roses
1521,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Where the Persian kitten dozes
1522,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And the sunlight sleeps upon
1523,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Crannies of the crumbling stone
1524,THE SPLENDID SECRET,--So hot it is you scarce can bear
1525,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Your naked hand upon it there,"
1526,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Though there luxuriating in heat
1527,THE SPLENDID SECRET,With a slow and gorgeous beat
1528,THE SPLENDID SECRET,White-winged currant-moths display
1529,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Their spots of black and gold all day.--
1530,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Well, since we greatly wished to know"
1531,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Whether we too might some day go
1532,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Where little Peterkin had gone
1533,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Without one word and all alone,"
1534,THE SPLENDID SECRET,We crept up through the laurels there
1535,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Hoping that we might overhear
1536,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"The splendid secret, darkly great,"
1537,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Of Peterkin’s mysterious fate;
1538,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And on what high adventure bound
1539,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"He left our pleasant garden-ground,"
1540,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Whether for old Japan once more
1541,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"He voyaged from the dim blue shore,"
1542,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Or whether he set out to run
1543,THE SPLENDID SECRET,By candle-light to Babylon.
1544,THE SPLENDID SECRET,
1545,THE SPLENDID SECRET,We just missed something father said
1546,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"About a young prince that was dead,"
1547,THE SPLENDID SECRET,A little warrior that had fought
1548,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And failed: how hopes were brought to nought
1549,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"He said, and mortals made to bow"
1550,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Before the Juggernaut of Death,"
1551,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"And all the world was darker now,"
1552,THE SPLENDID SECRET,For Time’s grey lips and icy breath
1553,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Had blown out all the enchanted lights
1554,THE SPLENDID SECRET,That burned in Love’s Arabian nights;
1555,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And now he could not understand
1556,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Mother’s mystic fairy-land,"
1557,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"“Land of the dead, poor fairy-tale,”"
1558,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"He murmured, and her face grew pale,"
1559,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And then with great soft shining eyes
1560,THE SPLENDID SECRET,She leant to him--she looked so wise--
1561,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"And, with her cheek against his cheek,"
1562,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"We heard her, ah so softly, speak."
1563,THE SPLENDID SECRET,
1564,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"“Husband, there was a happy day,"
1565,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Long ago, in love’s young May,"
1566,THE SPLENDID SECRET,When with a wild-flower in your hand
1567,THE SPLENDID SECRET,You echoed that dead poet’s cry--
1568,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"‘_Little flower, but if I could understand!_’"
1569,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"And you saw it had roots in the depths of the sky,"
1570,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And there in that smallest bud lay furled
1571,THE SPLENDID SECRET,The secret and meaning of all the world.”
1572,THE SPLENDID SECRET,
1573,THE SPLENDID SECRET,He shook his head and then he tried
1574,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"To kiss her, but she only cried"
1575,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"And turned her face away and said,"
1576,THE SPLENDID SECRET,“You come between me and my dead!
1577,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"His soul is near me, night and day,"
1578,THE SPLENDID SECRET,But you would drive it far away;
1579,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And you shall never kiss me now
1580,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Until you lift that brave old brow
1581,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Of faith I know so well; or else
1582,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Refute the tale the skylark tells,"
1583,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Tarnish the glory of that May,"
1584,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Explain the Smallest Flower away.”
1585,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"And still he said, “Poor fairy-tales,"
1586,THE SPLENDID SECRET,How terribly their starlight pales
1587,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Before the solemn sun of truth
1588,THE SPLENDID SECRET,That rises o’er the grave of youth!”
1589,THE SPLENDID SECRET,
1590,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"“Is heaven a fairy-tale?” she said,--"
1591,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And once again he shook his head;
1592,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And yet we ne’er could understand
1593,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Why heaven should _not_ be fairy-land,"
1594,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"A part of heaven at least, and why"
1595,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"The thought of it made mother cry,"
1596,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"And why they went away so sad,"
1597,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"And father still quite unforgiven,"
1598,THE SPLENDID SECRET,For what could children be but glad
1599,THE SPLENDID SECRET,To find a fairy-land in heaven?
1600,THE SPLENDID SECRET,
1601,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And as we talked it o’er we found
1602,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Our brains were really spinning round;
1603,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"But Dick, our eldest, late returned"
1604,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"From school, by all the lore he’d learned"
1605,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Declared that we should seek the lost
1606,THE SPLENDID SECRET,Smallest Flower at any cost.
1607,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"For, since within its leaves lay furled"
1608,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"The secret of the whole wide world,"
1609,THE SPLENDID SECRET,He thought that we might learn therein
1610,THE SPLENDID SECRET,The whereabouts of Peterkin;
1611,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"And, if we found the Flower, we knew"
1612,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Father would be forgiven, too;"
1613,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And mother’s kiss atone for all
1614,THE SPLENDID SECRET,The quarrel by the rose-hung wall;
1615,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"We knew not how, we knew not why,"
1616,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"But Dick it was who bade us try,"
1617,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Dick made it all seem plain and clear,"
1618,THE SPLENDID SECRET,And Dick it is who helps us here
1619,THE SPLENDID SECRET,To tell this tale of fairy-land
1620,THE SPLENDID SECRET,In words we scarce can understand.
1621,THE SPLENDID SECRET,For ere another golden hour
1622,THE SPLENDID SECRET,"Had passed, our anxious parents found"
1623,THE SPLENDID SECRET,We’d left the scented garden-ground
1624,THE SPLENDID SECRET,To seek--the Smallest Flower.

1652,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"I wonder if you’ve ever dreamed,"
1653,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"In summer’s noonday sleep,"

1656,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Like little crimson shimmering gems
1657,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Between the tiny twisted stems
1658,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Of fairy forests deep;
1659,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And what it looks like as they pass
1660,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Through jungles of the golden grass.

1665,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"A little gauze-winged fay,"
1666,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Oh then, as through the mighty shades"
1667,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Of wild thyme woods and violet glades
1668,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"You groped your forest-way,"
1669,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,How fraught each fragrant bough would be
1670,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,With dark o’erhanging mystery.
1671,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"How high the forest aisles would loom,"
1672,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,What wondrous wings would beat
1673,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Through gloamings loaded with perfume
1674,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"In many a rich retreat,"
1675,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,While trees like purple censers bowed
1676,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And swung beneath a swooning cloud
1677,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Mysteriously sweet,"
1678,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Where flowers that haunt no mortal clime
1679,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Burden the Forest of Wild Thyme.
1680,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1681,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We’d watched the bats and beetles flit
1682,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Through sunset-coloured air
1683,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The night that we discovered it
1684,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And all the heavens were bare:
1685,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We’d seen the colours melt and pass
1686,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Like silent ghosts across the grass
1687,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,To sleep--our hearts knew where;
1688,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And so we rose, and hand in hand"
1689,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We sought the gates of fairy-land.
1690,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1691,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"For Peterkin, oh Peterkin,"
1692,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"The cry was in our ears,"
1693,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"A fairy clamour, clear and thin"
1694,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,From lands beyond the years;
1695,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"A wistful note, a dying fall"
1696,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,As of the fairy bugle-call
1697,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Some dreamful changeling hears,"
1698,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And pines within his mortal home
1699,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Once more through fairy-land to roam.
1700,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We left behind the pleasant row
1701,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Of cottage window-panes,"
1702,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"The village inn’s red-curtained glow,"
1703,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The lovers in the lanes;
1704,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And stout of heart and strong of will
1705,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"We climbed the purple perfumed hill,"
1706,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And hummed the sweet refrains
1707,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Of fairy tunes the tall thin man
1708,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Taught us of old in Old Japan.
1709,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1710,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,So by the tall wide-barred church-gate
1711,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Through which we all could pass
1712,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"We came to where that curious plate,"
1713,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"That foolish plate of brass,"
1714,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Said Peterkin was fast asleep
1715,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Beneath a cold and ugly heap
1716,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Of earth and stones and grass.
1717,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"It was a splendid place for play,"
1718,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"That churchyard, on a summer’s day;"
1719,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1720,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,A splendid place for hide-and-seek
1721,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Between the grey old stones;
1722,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Where even grown-ups used to speak
1723,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,In awestruck whispering tones;
1724,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And here and there the grass ran wild
1725,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"In jungles for the creeping child,"
1726,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And there were elfin zones
1727,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Of twisted flowers and words in rhyme
1728,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And great sweet cushions of wild thyme.
1729,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1730,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,So in a wild thyme snuggery there
1731,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We stayed awhile to rest;
1732,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,A bell was calling folk to prayer:
1733,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,One star was in the West:
1734,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"The cottage lights grew far away,"
1735,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The whole sky seemed to waver and sway
1736,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Above our fragrant nest;
1737,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And from a distant dreamland moon
1738,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Once more we heard that fairy tune:
1739,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1740,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Why, mother once had sung it us"
1741,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"When, ere we went to bed,"
1742,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"She told the tale of Pyramus,"
1743,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,How Thisbe found him dead
1744,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And mourned his eyes as green as leeks,"
1745,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"His cherry nose, his cowslip cheeks."
1746,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1747,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,That tune would oft around us float
1748,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Since on a golden noon
1749,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We saw the play that Shakespeare wrote
1750,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Of Lion, Wall, and Moon;"
1751,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Ah, hark--the ancient fairy theme--"
1752,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,_Following darkness like a dream!_
1753,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1754,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"The very song Will Shakespeare sang,"
1755,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The music that through Sherwood rang
1756,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And Arden and that forest glade
1757,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Where Hermie and Lysander strayed,"
1758,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And Puck cried out with impish glee,"
1759,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"_Lord, what fools these mortals be_!"
1760,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Though the masquerade was mute
1761,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Of Quince and Snout and Snug and Flute,"
1762,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And Bottom with his donkey’s head
1763,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Decked with roses, white and red,"
1764,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Though the fairies had forsaken
1765,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Sherwood now and faintly shaken
1766,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"The forest-scents from off their feet,"
1767,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Yet from some divine retreat
1768,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Came the music, sweet and clear,"
1769,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,To hang upon the raptured ear
1770,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,With the free unfettered sway
1771,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Of blossoms in the moon of May.
1772,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Hark! the luscious fluttering
1773,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Of flower-soft words that kiss and cling,"
1774,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And part again with sweet farewells,"
1775,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And rhyme and chime like fairy-bells.
1776,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1777,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,“_I know a bank where the wild thyme blows
1778,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,"
1779,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,"
1780,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine._”
1781,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1782,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Out of the undiscovered land
1783,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"So sweetly rang the song,"
1784,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"We dreamed we wandered, hand in hand,"
1785,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"The fragrant aisles along,"
1786,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Where long ago had gone to dwell
1787,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,In some enchanted distant dell
1788,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The outlawed fairy throng
1789,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,When out of Sherwood’s wildest glen
1790,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"They sank, forsaking mortal men."
1791,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1792,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And as we dreamed, the shadowy ground"
1793,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Seemed gradually to swell;
1794,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And a strange forest rose around,"
1795,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,But how--we could not tell--
1796,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Purple against a rose-red sky
1797,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The big boughs brooded silently:
1798,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Far off we heard a bell;
1799,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And, suddenly, a great red light"
1800,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Smouldered before our startled sight.
1801,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1802,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Then came a cry, a fiercer flash,"
1803,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And down between the trees
1804,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"We saw great crimson figures crash,"
1805,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Wild-eyed monstrosities;
1806,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Great dragon-shapes that breathed a flame
1807,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,From roaring nostrils as they came:
1808,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We sank upon our knees;
1809,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And looming o’er us, ten yards high,"
1810,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Like battleships they thundered by.
1811,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1812,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And then, as down that mighty dell"
1813,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"We followed, faint with fear,"
1814,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We understood the tolling bell
1815,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,That called the monsters there;
1816,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,For right in front we saw a house
1817,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Woven of wild mysterious boughs
1818,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Bursting out everywhere
1819,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"In crimson flames, and with a shout"
1820,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The monsters rushed to put it out.
1821,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1822,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And, in a flash, the truth was ours;"
1823,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And there we knew--we knew--
1824,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"The meaning of those trees like flowers,"
1825,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Those boughs of rose and blue,"
1826,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And from the world we’d left above
1827,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,A voice came crooning like a dove
1828,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,To prove the dream was true:
1829,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And this--we knew it by the rhyme
1830,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Must be--the Forest of Wild Thyme.
1831,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1832,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,For out of the mystical rose-red dome
1833,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Of heaven the voice came murmuring down:
1834,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"_Oh, Ladybird, Ladybird, fly away home;"
1835,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Your house is on fire and your children are gone._
1836,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1837,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"We knew, we knew it by the rhyme,"
1838,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Though _we_ seemed, after all,"
1839,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"No tinier, yet the sweet wild thyme"
1840,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Towered like a forest tall
1841,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"All round us; oh, we knew not how,"
1842,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And yet--we knew those monsters now:
1843,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Our dream’s divine recall
1844,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Had dwarfed us, as with magic words;"
1845,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The dragons were but ladybirds!
1846,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1847,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And all around us as we gazed,"
1848,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Half glad, half frightened, all amazed,"
1849,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The scented clouds of purple smoke
1850,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,In lurid gleams of crimson broke;
1851,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And o’er our heads the huge black trees
1852,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Obscured the sky’s red mysteries;
1853,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,While here and there gigantic wings
1854,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Beat o’er us, and great scaly things"
1855,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Fold over monstrous leathern fold
1856,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Out of the smouldering copses rolled;
1857,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And eyes like blood-red pits of flame
1858,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,From many a forest-cavern came
1859,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"To glare across the blazing glade,"
1860,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Till, with the sudden thought dismayed,"
1861,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,We wondered if we e’er should find
1862,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,The mortal home we left behind:
1863,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Fear clutched us in a grisly grasp,"
1864,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"We gave one wild and white-lipped gasp,"
1865,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Then turned and ran, with streaming hair,"
1866,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Away, away, and anywhere!"
1867,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1868,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And hurry-skurry, heart and heel and hand, we tore along,"
1869,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And still our flying feet kept time and pattered on for Peterkin,"
1870,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"For Peterkin, oh Peterkin, it made a kind of song"
1871,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"To prove the road was right although it seemed so dark and wrong,"
1872,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,As through the desperate woods we plunged and
1873,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"ploughed for little Peterkin,"
1874,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,Where many a hidden jungle-beast made noises like a gong
1875,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,That rolled and roared and rumbled as we rushed along to Peterkin.
1876,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,
1877,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Peterkin, Peterkin, if you could only hear"
1878,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,And answer us; one little word from little lonely Peterkin
1879,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"To take and comfort father, he is sitting in his chair"
1880,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,In the library: he’s listening for your footstep on the stair
1881,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"And your patter down the passage, he can only think of Peterkin:"
1882,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,"Come back, come back to father, for to-day he’d let us tear"
1883,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,His newest book to make a paper-boat for little Peterkin.
1884,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,

1890,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT
1891,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,
1892,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,
1893,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Ah, what wonders round us rose"
1894,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"When we dared to pause and look,"
1895,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Curious things that seemed all toes,"
1896,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Goblins from a picture-book;
1897,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Ants like witches, four feet high,"
1898,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Waving all their skinny arms,"
1899,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Glared at us and wandered by,"
1900,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Muttering their ancestral charms.
1901,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,
1902,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Stately forms in green and gold
1903,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Armour strutted through the glades,"
1904,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Just as Hamlet’s ghost, we’re told,"
1905,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Mooned among the midnight shades;
1906,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Once a sort of devil came
1907,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Scattering broken trees about,"
1908,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Winged with leather, eyed with flame,--"
1909,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"He was but a moth, no doubt."
1910,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,
1911,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Here and there, above us clomb"
1912,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Feathery clumps of palm on high:
1913,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Those were ferns, of course, but some"
1914,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Really seemed to touch the sky;
1915,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Yes; and down one fragrant glade,"
1916,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Listening as we onward stole,"
1917,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Half delighted, half afraid,"
1918,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"_Dong_, we heard the hare-bells toll!"
1919,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,
1920,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Something told us what that gleam
1921,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Down the glen was brooding o’er;
1922,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Something told us in a dream
1923,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,What the bells were tolling for!
1924,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Something told us there was fear,"
1925,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Horror, peril, on our way!"
1926,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Was it far or was it near?
1927,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"_Near_, we heard the night-wind say."
1928,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,
1929,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"_Toll_, the music reeled and pealed"
1930,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Through the vast and sombre trees,"
1931,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Where a rosy light revealed
1932,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Dimmer, sweeter mysteries;"
1933,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"And, like petals of the rose,"
1934,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Fairy fans in beauty beat,"
1935,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Light in light--ah, what were those"
1936,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Rhymes we heard the night repeat?
1937,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,
1938,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"_Toll_, a dream within a dream,"
1939,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Up an aisle of rose and blue,"
1940,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Up the music’s perfumed stream
1941,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Came the words, and then we knew,"
1942,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,Knew that in that distant glen
1943,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Once again the case was tried,"
1944,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"Hark!--_Who killed Cock Robin, then?_"
1945,THE HIDEOUS HERMIT,"And a tiny voice replied,"
1946,“_I_,“_I_
1947,“_I_,_killed_
1948,“_I_,_Cock_
1949,“_I_,_Robin!_”
1950,“_I_,
1951,“_I_,"“_I!_ And who are _You_, sir, pray?”"
1952,“_I_,Growled a voice that froze our marrow:
1953,“_I_,"“Who!” we heard the murderer say,"
1954,“_I_,"“Lord, sir, I’m the famous Sparrow,"
1955,“_I_,And this ’ere’s my bow and arrow!
1956,“_I_,“_I_
1957,“_I_,_killed_
1958,“_I_,_Cock_
1959,“_I_,_Robin!_”
1960,“_I_,
1961,“_I_,"Then, with one great indrawn breath,"
1962,“_I_,Such a sighin’ and a sobbin’
1963,“_I_,Rose all round us for the death
1964,“_I_,"Of poor, poor Cock Robin,"
1965,“_I_,"Oh, we couldn’t bear to wait"
1966,“_I_,"Even to hear the murderer’s fate,"
1967,“_I_,Which we’d often wished to know
1968,“_I_,Sitting in the fireside glow
1969,“_I_,And with hot revengeful looks
1970,“_I_,Searched for in the nursery-books;
1971,“_I_,For the Robin and the Wren
1972,“_I_,"Are such friends to mortal men,"
1973,“_I_,Such dear friends to mortal men!
1974,“_I_,
1975,“_I_,_Toll_; and through the woods once more
1976,“_I_,"Stole we, drenched with fragrant dew:"
1977,“_I_,_Toll_; the hare-bell’s burden bore
1978,“_I_,Deeper meanings than we knew:
1979,“_I_,"Still it told us there was fear,"
1980,“_I_,"Horror, peril on our way!"
1981,“_I_,Was it far or was it near?
1982,“_I_,"_Near_, we heard the night-wind say!"
1983,“_I_,
1984,“_I_,_Near_; and once or twice we saw
1985,“_I_,"Something like a monstrous eye,"
1986,“_I_,Something like a hideous claw
1987,“_I_,Steal between us and the sky:
1988,“_I_,Still we hummed a dauntless tune
1989,“_I_,Trying to think such things might be
1990,“_I_,Glimpses of the fairy moon
1991,“_I_,Hiding in some hairy tree.
1992,“_I_,
1993,“_I_,Yet around us as we went
1994,“_I_,Through the glades of rose and blue
1995,“_I_,Sweetness with the horror blent
1996,“_I_,Wonder-wild in scent and hue:
1997,“_I_,"Here Aladdin’s cavern yawned,"
1998,“_I_,Jewelled thick with gorgeous dyes;
1999,“_I_,There a head of clover dawned
2000,“_I_,Like a cloud in eastern skies.
2001,“_I_,
2002,“_I_,"Hills of topaz, lakes of dew,"
2003,“_I_,Fairy cliffs of crystal sheen
2004,“_I_,Passed we; and the forest’s blue
2005,“_I_,Sea of branches tossed between:
2006,“_I_,Once we saw a gryphon make
2007,“_I_,One soft iris as it passed
2008,“_I_,Like the curving meteor’s wake
2009,“_I_,"O’er the forest, far and fast."
2010,“_I_,
2011,“_I_,"Winged with purple, breathing flame,"
2012,“_I_,"Crimson-eyed we saw him go,"
2013,“_I_,Where--ah! could it be the same
2014,“_I_,Cockchafer we used to know?--
2015,“_I_,"Valley-lilies overhead,"
2016,“_I_,"High aloof in clustered spray,"
2017,“_I_,"Far through heaven their splendour spread,"
2018,“_I_,Glimmering like the Milky Way.
2019,“_I_,
2020,“_I_,"Mammoths father calls “extinct,”"
2021,“_I_,"Creatures that the cave-men feared,"
2022,“_I_,"Through that forest walked and blinked,"
2023,“_I_,Through that jungle crawled and leered;
2024,“_I_,"Beasts no Nimrod ever knew,"
2025,“_I_,Woolly bears of black and red;
2026,“_I_,"Crocodiles, we wondered who"
2027,“_I_,Ever dared to see _them_ fed.
2028,“_I_,
2029,“_I_,"Were they lizards? If they were,"
2030,“_I_,They could swallow _us_ with ease;
2031,“_I_,But they slumbered quietly there
2032,“_I_,In among the mighty trees;
2033,“_I_,"Red and silver, blue and green,"
2034,“_I_,Played the moonlight on their scales;
2035,“_I_,"Golden eyes they had, and lean"
2036,“_I_,Crookéd legs with cruel nails.
2037,“_I_,
2038,“_I_,"Yet again, oh, faint and far,"
2039,“_I_,"Came the shadow of a cry,"
2040,“_I_,Like the calling of a star
2041,“_I_,To its brother in the sky;
2042,“_I_,Like an echo in a cave
2043,“_I_,"Where young mermen sound their shells,"
2044,“_I_,Like the wind across a grave
2045,“_I_,Bright with scent of lily-bells.
2046,“_I_,
2047,“_I_,Like a fairy hunter’s horn
2048,“_I_,Sounding in some purple glen
2049,“_I_,Sweet revelly to the morn
2050,“_I_,And the fairy quest again:
2051,“_I_,"Then, all round it surged a song"
2052,“_I_,We could never understand
2053,“_I_,"Though it lingered with us long,"
2054,“_I_,And it seemed so sad and grand.
2055,“_I_,
2056,“_I_,

2058,SONG,
2059,SONG,"_Little Boy Blue, come blow up your horn,"
2060,SONG,Summon the day of deliverance in:
2061,SONG,We are weary of bearing the burden of scorn_
2062,SONG,_As we yearn for the home that we never shall win;
2063,SONG,"For here there is weeping and sorrow and sin,"
2064,SONG,And the poor and the weak are a spoil for the strong!
2065,SONG,Ah! when shall the song of the ransomed begin?
2066,SONG,The world is grown weary with waiting so long._
2067,SONG,
2068,SONG,"_Little Boy Blue, you are gallant and brave,"
2069,SONG,There was never a doubt in those clear bright eyes;
2070,SONG,"Come, challenge the grim dark Gates of the Grave"
2071,SONG,As the skylark sings to those infinite skies!
2072,SONG,"This world is a dream, say the old and the wise,"
2073,SONG,And its rainbows arise o’er the false and the true;
2074,SONG,"But the mists of the morning are made of our sighs,--_"
2075,SONG,"_Ah, shatter them, scatter them, Little Boy"
2076,SONG,Blue!_
2077,SONG,
2078,SONG,"_Little Boy Blue, if the child-heart knows,"
2079,SONG,Sound but a note as a little one may;

2081,SONG,And the Healer shall wipe all tears away;
2082,SONG,"Little Boy Blue, we are all astray,"
2083,SONG,"The sheep’s in the meadow, the cow’s in the corn,"
2084,SONG,"Ah, set the world right, as a little one may;"
2085,SONG,"Little Boy Blue, come blow up your horn!_"
2086,SONG,
2087,SONG,Yes; and there between the trees
2088,SONG,Circled with a misty gleam
2089,SONG,Like the light a mourner sees
2090,SONG,Round an angel in a dream;
2091,SONG,"Was it he? oh, brave and slim,"
2092,SONG,"Straight and clad in æry blue,"
2093,SONG,Lifting to his lips the dim
2094,SONG,Golden horn? We never knew!
2095,SONG,
2096,SONG,Never; for a witch’s hair
2097,SONG,"Flooded all the moonlit sky,"
2098,SONG,"And he vanished, then and there,"
2099,SONG,In the twinkling of an eye:
2100,SONG,Just as either boyish cheek
2101,SONG,"Puffed to set the world aright,"
2102,SONG,Ere the golden horn could speak
2103,SONG,Round him flowed the purple night.

2106,SONG,
2107,SONG,At last we came to a round black road
2108,SONG,"That tunnelled through the woods and showed,"
2109,SONG,"Or so we thought, a good clear way"
2110,SONG,Back to the upper lands of day;
2111,SONG,Great silken cables overhead
2112,SONG,In many a mighty mesh were spread
2113,SONG,"Netting the rounded arch, no doubt"
2114,SONG,To keep the weight of leafage out.
2115,SONG,"And, as the tunnel narrowed down"
2116,SONG,So thick and close the cords had grown
2117,SONG,"No leaf could through their meshes stray,"
2118,SONG,And the faint moonlight died away;
2119,SONG,Only a strange grey glimmer shone
2120,SONG,"To guide our weary footsteps on,"
2121,SONG,"Until, tired out, we stood before"
2122,SONG,"The end, a great grey silken door."
2123,SONG,
2124,SONG,"Then from out a weird old wicket, overgrown with shaggy hair"
2125,SONG,"Like a weird and wicked eyebrow round a weird and wicked eye,"
2126,SONG,Two great eyeballs and a beard
2127,SONG,For one ghastly moment peered
2128,SONG,At our faces with a sudden stealthy stare:
2129,SONG,"Then the door was opened wide,"
2130,SONG,And a hideous hermit cried
2131,SONG,"With a shy and soothing smile from out his lair,"
2132,SONG,_Won’t you walk into my parlour? I can make you cosy there!_
2133,SONG,
2134,SONG,"And we couldn’t quite remember where we’d heard that phrase before,"
2135,SONG,As the great grey-bearded ogre stood beside his open door;
2136,SONG,But an echo seemed to answer from a land beyond the sky--
2137,SONG,_Won’t you walk into my parlour? said the spider to the fly!_
2138,SONG,
2139,SONG,Then we looked a little closer at the ogre as he stood
2140,SONG,"With his great red eyeballs glowing like two torches in a wood,"
2141,SONG,"And his mighty speckled belly and his dreadful clutching claws,"
2142,SONG,"And his nose--a horny parrot’s beak, his whiskers and his jaws;"
2143,SONG,"Yet he seemed so sympathetic, and we saw two tears descend,"
2144,SONG,"As he murmured, “I’m so ugly, but I’ve lost my dearest friend!"
2145,SONG,"I tell you most lymphatic’ly, I’ve yearnings in my soul,”--"
2146,SONG,And right along his parrot’s beak we saw the tear-drops roll;
2147,SONG,"He’s an _arrant sentimentalist_, we heard a distant sigh,"
2148,SONG,_Won’t you weep upon my bosom? said the spider to the fly._
2149,SONG,
2150,SONG,"“If you’d dreamed my dreams of beauty, if you’d seen my works of art,"
2151,SONG,"If you’d felt the cruel hunger that is gnawing at my heart,"
2152,SONG,"And the grief that never leaves me and the love I can’t forget,"
2153,SONG,(For I loved with all the letters in the Chinese alphabet!)
2154,SONG,"Oh, you’d all come in to comfort me: you ought to help the weak;"
2155,SONG,And I’m full of melting moments; and--I--know--the--thing--you--seek!”
2156,SONG,"And the haunting echo answered, _Well, I’m sure you ought to try;"
2157,SONG,"There’s a duty to one’s neighbour, said the spider to the fly._"
2158,SONG,
2159,SONG,So we walked into his parlour
2160,SONG,Though a gleam was in his eye;
2161,SONG,And it _was_ the prettiest parlour
2162,SONG,That ever we did spy!
2163,SONG,
2164,SONG,But we saw by the uncertain
2165,SONG,"Misty light, shot through with gleams"
2166,SONG,Of many a silken curtain
2167,SONG,"Broidered o’er with dreadful dreams,"
2168,SONG,That he locked the door behind us! So we stood with bated breath
2169,SONG,In a silence deep as death.
2170,SONG,
2171,SONG,There were scarlet gleams and crimson
2172,SONG,"In the curious foggy grey,"
2173,SONG,Like the blood-red light that swims on
2174,SONG,"Old canals at fall of day,"
2175,SONG,Where the smoke of some great city loops and droops in gorgeous veils
2176,SONG,Round the heavy purple barges’ tawny sails.
2177,SONG,
2178,SONG,Were those creatures gagged and muffled
2179,SONG,See--there--by that severed head?
2180,SONG,Was it but a breeze that ruffled
2181,SONG,"Those dark curtains, splashed with red,"
2182,SONG,"Ruffled the dark figures on them, made them moan like things in pain?"
2183,SONG,How we wished that we were safe at home again.
2184,SONG,
2185,SONG,*       *       *       *       *
2186,SONG,
2187,SONG,"“Oh, we want to hear of Peterkin; good sir, you say you know;"
2188,SONG,"Won’t you tell us, won’t you put us in the way we want to go?”"
2189,SONG,"So we pleaded, for he seemed so very full of sighs and tears"
2190,SONG,"That we couldn’t doubt his kindness, and we smothered all our fears;"
2191,SONG,"But he said, “You must be crazy if you come to me for help;"
2192,SONG,Why should I desire to send you to your horrid little whelp?”
2193,SONG,"And again the foolish echo made a far-away reply,"
2194,SONG,"_Oh, don’t come to me for comfort,"
2195,SONG,"Pray don’t look to me for comfort,"
2196,SONG,"Heavens! you mustn’t be so selfish, said the spider to the fly._"
2197,SONG,
2198,SONG,"“Still, when the King of Scotland, so to speak, was in a hole,"
2199,SONG,He was aided by my brother: it’s a story to console
2200,SONG,"The convict on the treadmill and the infant with a sum,"
2201,SONG,For it teaches you to try again until your kingdom’s come!
2202,SONG,The monarch dawdled in that hole for centuries of time
2203,SONG,Until my own twin-brother rose and showed him how to climb:
2204,SONG,He showed him how to swing and sway upon a tiny thread
2205,SONG,"Across a mighty precipice, and light upon his head"
2206,SONG,Without a single fracture and without a single pain
2207,SONG,If he only did it frequently and tried and tried again:”
2208,SONG,"And once again the whisper like a moral wandered by,"
2209,SONG,"_Perseverance is a virtue, said the spider to the fly._"
2210,SONG,
2211,SONG,"Then he moaned, “My heart is hungry; but I fear I cannot eat,"
2212,SONG,(Of course I speak entirely now of spiritual meat!)
2213,SONG,"For I only fed an hour ago, but if we calmly sat"
2214,SONG,While I told you all my troubles in a confidential chat
2215,SONG,"It would give me _such_ an appetite to hear you sympathise,"
2216,SONG,"And I should sleep the better--see, the tears are in my eyes!"
2217,SONG,"Dead yearnings are such dreadful things, let’s keep ’em all alive,--"
2218,SONG,"Let’s sit and talk awhile, my dears; we’ll dine, I think, at five.”"
2219,SONG,"And he brought his chair beside us in his most engaging style,"
2220,SONG,And began to tell his story with a melancholy smile.--
2221,SONG,
2222,SONG,“You remember Miss Muffet
2223,SONG,Who sat on a tuffet
2224,SONG,Partaking of curds and whey;
2225,SONG,"Well, _I_ am the spider"
2226,SONG,Who sat down beside her
2227,SONG,And frightened Miss Muffet away!
2228,SONG,There was nothing against her!
2229,SONG,An elderly spinster
2230,SONG,Were such a grammatical mate
2231,SONG,"For a spider and spinner,"
2232,SONG,"I swore I would win her,"
2233,SONG,I knew I had met with my fate!
2234,SONG,
2235,SONG,That love was the purest
2236,SONG,And strongest and surest
2237,SONG,I’d felt since my first thread was spun;
2238,SONG,"I know I’m a bogey,"
2239,SONG,"But _she’s_ an old fogey,"
2240,SONG,So why in the world did she run?
2241,SONG,"When Bruce was in trouble,"
2242,SONG,"A spider, my double,"
2243,SONG,"Encouraged him greatly, they say!"
2244,SONG,"Now, _why_ should the spider"
2245,SONG,Who sat down beside her
2246,SONG,Have frightened Miss Muffet away?”
2247,SONG,
2248,SONG,"He seemed to have much more to tell,"
2249,SONG,"But we could scarce be listening well,"
2250,SONG,Although we tried with all our might
2251,SONG,To look attentive and polite;
2252,SONG,For still afar we heard the thin
2253,SONG,Clear fairy-call to Peterkin;
2254,SONG,Clear as a skylark’s mounting song
2255,SONG,It drew our wandering thoughts along.
2256,SONG,"Afar, it seemed, yet, ah, so nigh,"
2257,SONG,"Deep in our dreams it scaled the sky,"
2258,SONG,In captive dreams that brooked no bars
2259,SONG,"It touched the love that moves the stars,"
2260,SONG,And with sweet music’s golden tether
2261,SONG,It bound our hearts and heaven together.
2262,SONG,
2263,SONG,
2264,SONG,SONG
2265,SONG,
2266,SONG,"_Wake, arise, the lake, the skies_"
2267,SONG,_Fade into the faery day;_
2268,SONG,"_Come and sing before our king,_"
2269,SONG,"_Heed not Time, the dotard grey;_"
2270,SONG,"_Time has given his crown to heaven--Ah,_"
2271,SONG,"_how long? Awake, away!_"
2272,SONG,
2273,SONG,"Then, as the Hermit rambled on"
2274,SONG,"In one long listless monotone,"
2275,SONG,We heard a wild and mournful groan
2276,SONG,Come rumbling down the tunnelled way;
2277,SONG,"A voice, an awful mournful bray,"
2278,SONG,Singing some old funereal lay;
2279,SONG,"Then solemn footsteps, muffled, dull,"
2280,SONG,"Approached as if they trod on wool,"
2281,SONG,"And as they nearer, nearer drew,"
2282,SONG,We saw our Host was listening too!
2283,SONG,
2284,SONG,His bulging eyes began to glow
2285,SONG,"Like great red match-heads rubbed at night,"
2286,SONG,And then he stole with a grim “O-ho!”
2287,SONG,"To that grey old wicket where, out of sight,"
2288,SONG,"Blandly rubbing his hands and humming,"
2289,SONG,"He could see, at one glance, whatever was coming."
2290,SONG,
2291,SONG,"He had never been so jubilant or frolicsome before,"
2292,SONG,As he scurried on his cruel hairy crutches to the door;
2293,SONG,And flung it open wide
2294,SONG,"And most hospitably cried,"
2295,SONG,"“Won’t you walk into my parlour? I’ve some little friends to tea,--"
2296,SONG,"They’ll be highly entertaining to a man of sympathy,"
2297,SONG,Such as you yourself must be!”
2298,SONG,
2299,SONG,"Then the man, for so he seemed,"
2300,SONG,(Doubtless one who’d lost his way
2301,SONG,And was dwarfed as we had been!)
2302,SONG,"In his ancient suit of black,"
2303,SONG,"Black upon the verge of green,"
2304,SONG,Entered like a ghost that dreamed
2305,SONG,Sadly of some bygone day;
2306,SONG,And he never ceased to sing
2307,SONG,In that awful mournful bray.
2308,SONG,
2309,SONG,The door closed behind his back;
2310,SONG,"He walked round us in a ring,"
2311,SONG,"And we hoped that he might free us,"
2312,SONG,"But his tears appeared to blind him,"
2313,SONG,"For he didn’t seem to see us,"
2314,SONG,And the Hermit crept behind him
2315,SONG,Like a cat about to spring.
2316,SONG,
2317,SONG,And the song he sang was this;
2318,SONG,And his nose looked very grand
2319,SONG,"As he sang it, with a bliss"
2320,SONG,Which we could not understand;
2321,SONG,"For his voice was very sad,"
2322,SONG,While his nose was proud and glad.
2323,SONG,
2324,SONG,"_Rain, April, rain, thy sunny, sunny tears!_"
2325,SONG,"_Through the black boughs the robe of Spring appears,_"
2326,SONG,"_Yet, for the ghosts of all the bygone years,_"
2327,SONG,"_Rain, April, rain._"
2328,SONG,
2329,SONG,"_Rain, April, rain; the rose will soon be glad;_"
2330,SONG,"_Spring will rejoice, a Spring I, too, have had;_"
2331,SONG,"_A little while, till I no more be sad,_"
2332,SONG,"_Rain, April, rain._"
2333,SONG,
2334,SONG,And then the spider sprang
2335,SONG,"Before we could breathe or speak,"
2336,SONG,And one great scream out-rang
2337,SONG,As the terrible horny beak
2338,SONG,"Crunched into the Sad Man’s head,"
2339,SONG,And the terrible hairy claws
2340,SONG,Clutched him around his middle;
2341,SONG,"And he opened his lantern-jaws,"
2342,SONG,"And he gave one twist, one twiddle,"
2343,SONG,"One kick, and his sorrow was dead."
2344,SONG,
2345,SONG,"And there, as he sucked his bleeding prey,"
2346,SONG,"The spider leered at us--“You will do,"
2347,SONG,"My sweet little dears, for another day;"
2348,SONG,But this is the sort I like; huh! huh!”
2349,SONG,
2350,SONG,"And there we stood, in frozen fear,"
2351,SONG,"Whiter than death,"
2352,SONG,With bated breath;
2353,SONG,"And lo! as we thought of Peterkin,"
2354,SONG,"Father and home and Peterkin,"
2355,SONG,"Once more that music clear and thin,"
2356,SONG,"Clear as a skylark’s mounting song,"
2357,SONG,"But nearer now, more sweet, more strong,"
2358,SONG,"Drew all our wandering thoughts along,"
2359,SONG,"Until it seemed, a mystic sea"
2360,SONG,Of hidden delight and harmony
2361,SONG,Began to ripple and rise all round
2362,SONG,The prison where our hearts lay bound;
2363,SONG,And from sweet heaven’s most rosy rim
2364,SONG,There swelled a distant marching hymn
2365,SONG,Which made the hideous Hermit pause
2366,SONG,"And listen with lank down-dropt jaws,"
2367,SONG,"Till, with great bulging eyes of fear,"
2368,SONG,He sought the wicket again to peer
2369,SONG,"Along the tunnel, as like sweet rain"
2370,SONG,"We heard the still approaching strain,"
2371,SONG,"And, under it, the rhythmic beat"
2372,SONG,Of multitudinous marching feet.
2373,SONG,"Nearer, nearer, they rippled and rang,"
2374,SONG,And this was the marching song they sang:--
2375,SONG,
2376,SONG,
2377,SONG,SONG
2378,SONG,
2379,SONG,_A fairy band are we_
2380,SONG,_In fairy-land:_
2381,SONG,"_Singing march we, hand in hand;_"
2382,SONG,"_Singing, singing all day long:_"
2383,SONG,_(Some folk never heard a fairy-song!)_
2384,SONG,
2385,SONG,"_Singing, singing,_"
2386,SONG,_When the merry thrush is swinging_
2387,SONG,_On a springing spray;_
2388,SONG,_Or when the witch that lives in gloomy caves_
2389,SONG,_And creeps by night among the graves_
2390,SONG,_Calls a cloud across the day;_
2391,SONG,"_Cease we never our fairy song,_"
2392,SONG,"_March we ever, along, along,_"
2393,SONG,"_Down the dale, or up the hill,_"
2394,SONG,"_Singing, singing still._"
2395,SONG,
2396,SONG,And suddenly the Hermit turned and ran with all his might
2397,SONG,Through the back-door of his parlour as we thought of little Peterkin;
2398,SONG,"And the great grey roof was shattered by a shower of rosy light,"
2399,SONG,"And the spider-house went floating, torn and tattered through the night"
2400,SONG,"In a flight of prismy streamers, as a shout went up for Peterkin;"
2401,SONG,"And lo, the glistening fairy-host stood there arrayed for fight,"
2402,SONG,"In arms of rose and green and gold, to lead us on to Peterkin."
2403,SONG,
2404,SONG,"And all around us, rippling like a pearl and opal sea,"
2405,SONG,The host of fairy faces winked a kindly hint of Peterkin;
2406,SONG,And all around the rosy glade a laugh of fairy glee
2407,SONG,Watched spider-streamers floating up from fragrant tree to tree
2408,SONG,"Till the moonlight caught the gossamers and, oh we wished for Peterkin!"
2409,SONG,Each rope became a rainbow; but it made us ache to see
2410,SONG,Such a fairy forest-pomp without explaining it to Peterkin.
2411,SONG,
2412,SONG,Then all the glittering crowd
2413,SONG,With a courtly gesture bowed
2414,SONG,Like a rosy jewelled cloud
2415,SONG,"Round a flame,"
2416,SONG,"As the King of Fairy-land,"
2417,SONG,"Very dignified and grand,"
2418,SONG,Stepped forward to demand
2419,SONG,Whence we came.
2420,SONG,
2421,SONG,He’d a cloak of gold and green
2422,SONG,"Such as caterpillars spin,"
2423,SONG,"For the fairy ways, I ween,"
2424,SONG,Are very frugal;
2425,SONG,He’d a bow that he had borne
2426,SONG,"Since the crimson Eden morn,"
2427,SONG,And a honeysuckle horn
2428,SONG,For his bugle.
2429,SONG,
2430,SONG,"So we told our tale of faëry to the King of Fairy-land,"
2431,SONG,And asked if he could let us know the latest news of Peterkin;
2432,SONG,And he turned him with a courtly smile and waved his jewelled wand
2433,SONG,"And cried, _Pease-blossom, Mustard-seed! You know the old command;_"
2434,SONG,_Well; these are little children; you must lead them on to Peterkin._
2435,SONG,"Then he knelt, the King of Faëry knelt; his eyes were great and grand"
2436,SONG,"As he took our hands and kissed them, saying, _Father"
2437,SONG,loves your Peterkin_!
2438,SONG,
2439,SONG,"So out they sprang, on either side,"
2440,SONG,"A light fantastic fairy guide,"
2441,SONG,To lead us to the land unknown
2442,SONG,Where little Peterkin was gone;
2443,SONG,"And, as we went with timid pace,"
2444,SONG,We saw that every fairy face
2445,SONG,In all that moonlit host was wet
2446,SONG,With tears: we never shall forget
2447,SONG,The mystic hush that seemed to fade
2448,SONG,"Away like sound, as down the glade"
2449,SONG,We passed beyond their zone of light.
2450,SONG,Then through the forest’s purple night
2451,SONG,"We trotted, at a pleasant speed,"
2452,SONG,With gay Pease-blossom and Mustard-seed.
2453,SONG,
2454,SONG,
2455,SONG,
2456,SONG,
2457,PART IV,PART IV
2458,PART IV,
2459,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED
2460,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
2461,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
2462,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Shyly we surveyed our guides
2463,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,As through the gloomy woods we went
2464,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,In the light that the straggling moonbeams lent:
2465,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,We envied them their easy strides!
2466,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Pease-blossom in his crimson cap
2467,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"And delicate suit of rose-leaf green,"
2468,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"His crimson sash and his jewelled dagger,"
2469,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Strutted along with an elegant swagger
2470,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Which showed that he didn’t care one rap
2471,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,For anything less than a Fairy Queen:
2472,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"His eyes were deep like the eyes of a poet,"
2473,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Although his crisp and curly hair
2474,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Certainly didn’t seem to show it!
2475,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,While Mustard-seed was a devil-may-care
2476,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Epigrammatic and pungent fellow
2477,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Clad in a splendid suit of yellow,"
2478,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,With emerald stars on his glittering breast
2479,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And eyes that shone with a diamond light:
2480,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,They made you feel sure it would always be best
2481,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,To tell him the truth: he was not perhaps _quite_
2482,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"So polite as Pease-blossom, but then who could be"
2483,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,_Quite_ such a debonair fairy as he?
2484,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
2485,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,We never could tell you one-half that we heard
2486,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"And saw on that journey. For instance, a bird"
2487,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Ten times as big as an elephant stood
2488,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,By the side of a nest like a great thick wood:
2489,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,The clouds in glimmering wreaths were spread
2490,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Behind its vast and shadowy head
2491,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Which rolled at us trembling below. (Its eyes
2492,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Were like great black moons in those pearl-pale skies.)
2493,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"And we feared he might take us, perhaps, for a worm."
2494,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
2495,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"But he ruffled his breast with the sound of a storm,"
2496,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And snuggled his head with a careless disdain
2497,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Under his huge hunched wing again;
2498,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"And Mustard-seed said, as we stole thro’ the dark,"
2499,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,There was nothing to fear: it was only a Lark!
2500,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
2501,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And so he cheered the way along
2502,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"With many a neat little epigram,"
2503,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,While dear Pease-blossom before him swam
2504,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"On a billow of lovely moonlit song,"
2505,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Telling us why they had left their home
2506,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"In Sherwood, and had hither come"
2507,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"To dwell in this magical scented clime,"
2508,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,This dim old Forest of sweet Wild Thyme.
2509,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
2510,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"“Men toil,” he said, “from morn till night"
2511,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,With bleeding hands and blinded sight
2512,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"For gold, more gold! They have betrayed"
2513,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,The trust that in their souls was laid;
2514,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Their fairy birthright they have sold
2515,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,For little disks of mortal gold;
2516,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And now they cannot even see
2517,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"The gold upon the greenwood tree,"
2518,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,The wealth of coloured lights that pass
2519,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"In soft gradations through the grass,"
2520,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,The riches of the love untold
2521,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,That wakes the day from grey to gold;
2522,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And howsoe’er the moonlight weaves
2523,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Magic webs among the leaves
2524,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Englishmen care little now
2525,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,For elves beneath the hawthorn bough:
2526,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Nor if Robin should return
2527,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Dare they of an outlaw learn;
2528,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"For them the Smallest Flower is furled,"
2529,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Mute is the music of the world;
2530,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And unbelief has driven away
2531,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Beauty from the blossomed spray.”
2532,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
2533,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Then Mustard-seed with diamond eyes
2534,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Taught us to be laughter-wise,"
2535,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And he showed us how that Time
2536,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Is much less powerful than a rhyme;
2537,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And that Space is but a dream;
2538,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"“For look,” he said, with eyes agleam,"
2539,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,“Now you are become so small
2540,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,You think the Thyme a forest tall;
2541,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,But underneath your feet you see
2542,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,A world of wilder mystery
2543,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Where, if you were smaller yet,"
2544,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,You would just as soon forget
2545,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"This forest, which you’d leave above"
2546,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,As you have left the home you love!
2547,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"For, since the Thyme you used to know"
2548,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Seems a forest here below,"
2549,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,What if you should sink again
2550,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And find there stretched a mighty plain
2551,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Between each grass-blade and the next?
2552,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,You’d think till you were quite perplexed!
2553,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Especially if all the flowers
2554,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,That lit the sweet Thyme-forest bowers
2555,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Were in that wild transcendent change
2556,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Turned to Temples, great and strange,"
2557,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,With many a pillared portal high
2558,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And domes that swelled against the sky!
2559,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"How foolish, then, you will agree,"
2560,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Are those who think that all must see
2561,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"The world alike, or those who scorn"
2562,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Another who, perchance, was born"
2563,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Where--in a different dream from theirs--
2564,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,What they call sins to him are prayers!
2565,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,We cannot judge; we cannot know;
2566,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,All things mingle; all things flow;
2567,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,There’s only one thing constant here--
2568,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Love--that untranscended sphere:
2569,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Love, that while all ages run"
2570,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Holds the wheeling worlds in one;
2571,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Love that, as your sages tell,"
2572,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Soars to heaven and sinks to hell.”
2573,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
2574,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Even as he spoke, we seemed to grow"
2575,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Smaller, the Thyme trees seemed to go"
2576,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Farther away from us: new dreams
2577,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Flashed out on us with mystic gleams
2578,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Of mighty Temple-domes: deep awe
2579,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Held us all breathless as we saw
2580,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,A carven portal glimmering out
2581,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Between new flowers that put to rout
2582,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Our other fancies: in sweet fear
2583,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"We tiptoed past, and seemed to hear"
2584,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,A sound of singing from within
2585,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,That told our souls of Peterkin:
2586,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Our thoughts of _him_ were still the same
2587,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Howe’er the shadows went and came!
2588,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"So, on we wandered, hand in hand,"
2589,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And all the world was fairy-land.
2590,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
2591,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,*       *       *       *       *
2592,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
2593,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And as we went we seemed to hear
2594,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,Surging up from distant dells
2595,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"A solemn music, soft and clear"
2596,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,As if a field of lily-bells
2597,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,"Were tolling all together, sweet"
2598,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,But sad and low and keeping time
2599,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,To multitudinous marching feet
2600,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,With a slow funereal beat
2601,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,And a deep harmonious chime
2602,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,That told us by its dark refrain
2603,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,The reason fairies suffered pain.
2604,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
2605,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
2606,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
2607,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,
2608,SONG,SONG
2609,SONG,
2610,SONG,
2611,SONG,Bear her along
2612,SONG,Keep ye your song
2613,SONG,Tender and sweet and low:
2614,SONG,Fairies must die!
2615,SONG,Ask ye not why
2616,SONG,Ye that have hurt her so.
2617,SONG,_Passing away--flower from the spray! Colour and light from the leaf!
2618,SONG,"Soon, soon will the year shed its bloom on her bier, and"
2619,SONG,the dust of its dreams on our grief._
2620,SONG,
2621,SONG,Men upon earth
2622,SONG,Bring us to birth
2623,SONG,Gently at even and morn!
2624,SONG,When as brother and brother
2625,SONG,They greet one another
2626,SONG,And smile--then a fairy is born!
2627,SONG,But at each cruel word
2628,SONG,"Upon earth that is heard,"
2629,SONG,"Each deed of unkindness or hate,"
2630,SONG,Some fairy must pass
2631,SONG,From the games in the grass
2632,SONG,And steal thro’ the terrible Gate.
2633,SONG,_Passing away--flower from the spray! Colour and light from the leaf!
2634,SONG,"Soon, soon will the year shed its bloom on her bier, and the"
2635,SONG,dust of its dreams on our grief._
2636,SONG,
2637,SONG,"If ye knew, if ye knew"
2638,SONG,All the wrong that ye do
2639,SONG,"By the thought that ye harbour alone,"
2640,SONG,How the face of some fairy
2641,SONG,Grows wistful and weary
2642,SONG,And the heart in her cold as a stone!
2643,SONG,"Ah, she was born"
2644,SONG,Blithe as the morn
2645,SONG,"Under an April sky,"
2646,SONG,Born of the greeting
2647,SONG,Of two lovers meeting!
2648,SONG,"They parted, and so she must die!"
2649,SONG,_Passing away--flower from the spray! Colour and light from the leaf!_
2650,SONG,"_Soon, soon will the year shed its bloom on her bier, and"
2651,SONG,the dust of its dreams on our grief._
2652,SONG,
2653,SONG,"Cradled in blisses,"
2654,SONG,"Yea, born of your kisses,"
2655,SONG,"Oh, ye lovers that met by the moon,"
2656,SONG,She would not have cried
2657,SONG,In the darkness and died
2658,SONG,If ye had not forgotten so soon!
2659,SONG,
2660,SONG,"Cruel mortals, they say,"
2661,SONG,"Live for ever and aye,"
2662,SONG,And they pray in the dark on their knees!
2663,SONG,But the flowers that are fled
2664,SONG,"And the loves that are dead,"
2665,SONG,What heaven takes pity on these?
2666,SONG,
2667,SONG,_Bear her along--singing your song--tender and sweet and low!_
2668,SONG,_Fairies must die! Ask ye not why--ye that have hurt her so._
2669,SONG,
2670,SONG,Passing away--
2671,SONG,Flower from the spray!
2672,SONG,Colour and light from the leaf!
2673,SONG,"Soon, soon will the year"
2674,SONG,Shed its bloom on her bier
2675,SONG,And the dust of its dreams on our grief!
2676,SONG,
2677,SONG,*       *       *       *       *
2678,SONG,
2679,SONG,Then we came through a glittering crystal grot
2680,SONG,"By a path like a pale moonbeam,"
2681,SONG,And a broad blue bridge of Forget-me-not
2682,SONG,"Over a shimmering stream,"
2683,SONG,"To where, through the deep blue dusk, a gleam"
2684,SONG,Rose like the soul of the setting sun;
2685,SONG,"A sunset breaking through the earth,"
2686,SONG,"A crimson sea of the poppies of dream,"
2687,SONG,Deep as the sleep that gave them birth
2688,SONG,In the night where all earthly dreams are done.
2689,SONG,
2690,SONG,"And then, like a pearl-pale porch of the moon,"
2691,SONG,"Faint and sweet as a starlit shrine,"
2692,SONG,Over the gloom
2693,SONG,Of the crimson bloom
2694,SONG,We saw the Gates of Ivory shine;
2695,SONG,"And, lulled and lured by the lullaby tune"
2696,SONG,Of the cradling airs that drowsily creep
2697,SONG,"From blossom to blossom, and lazily croon"
2698,SONG,"Through the heart of the midnight’s mystic noon,"
2699,SONG,We came to the Gates of the City of Sleep.
2700,SONG,
2701,SONG,Faint and sweet as a lily’s repose
2702,SONG,"On the broad black breast of a midnight lake,"
2703,SONG,The City delighted the cradling night:
2704,SONG,Like a straggling palace of cloud it rose;
2705,SONG,The towers were crowned with a crystal light
2706,SONG,Like the starry crown of a white snowflake
2707,SONG,"As they pierced in a wild white pinnacled crowd,"
2708,SONG,Through the dusky wreaths of enchanted cloud
2709,SONG,That swirled all round like a witch’s hair.
2710,SONG,
2711,SONG,"And we heard, as the sound of a great sea sighing,"
2712,SONG,The sigh of the sleepless world of care;
2713,SONG,And we saw strange shadowy figures flying
2714,SONG,Up to the Ivory Gates and beating
2715,SONG,"With pale hands, long and famished and thin;"
2716,SONG,Like blinded birds we saw them dash
2717,SONG,Against the cruelly gleaming wall:
2718,SONG,We heard them wearily moan and call
2719,SONG,With sharp starved lips for ever entreating
2720,SONG,The pale doorkeeper to let them in.
2721,SONG,"And still, as they beat, again and again,"
2722,SONG,We saw on the moon-pale lintels a splash
2723,SONG,Of crimson blood like a poppy-stain
2724,SONG,Or a wild red rose from the gardens of pain
2725,SONG,That sigh all night like a ghostly sea
2726,SONG,From the City of Sleep to Gethsemane.
2727,SONG,
2728,SONG,"And lo, as we neared that mighty crowd"
2729,SONG,"An old blind man came, crying aloud"
2730,SONG,"To greet us, as once the blind man cried"
2731,SONG,In the Bible picture--you know we tried
2732,SONG,"To paint that print, with its Eastern sun;"
2733,SONG,"But the reds and the yellows _would_ mix and run,"
2734,SONG,And the blue of the sky made a horrible mess
2735,SONG,Right over the edge of the Lord’s white dress.
2736,SONG,
2737,SONG,"And the old blind man, just as though he had eyes,"
2738,SONG,Came straight to meet us; and all the cries
2739,SONG,Of the crowd were hushed; and a strange sweet calm
2740,SONG,Stole through the air like a breath of the balm
2741,SONG,That was wafted abroad from the Forest of Thyme
2742,SONG,(For it rolled all round that curious clime
2743,SONG,With its magical clouds of perfumed trees.)
2744,SONG,"And the blind man cried, “Our help is at hand,"
2745,SONG,"Oh, brothers, remember the old command,"
2746,SONG,"Remember the frankincense and myrrh,"
2747,SONG,"Make way, make way for those little ones there;"
2748,SONG,"Make way, make way, I have seen them afar"
2749,SONG,Under a great white Eastern star;
2750,SONG,For I am the mad blind man who sees!”
2751,SONG,"Then he whispered, softly--_Of such as these_;"
2752,SONG,And through the hush of the cloven crowd
2753,SONG,"We passed to the gates of the City, and there"
2754,SONG,Our fairy heralds cried aloud--
2755,SONG,_Open your Gates; don’t stand and stare;
2756,SONG,These are the Children for whom our King
2757,SONG,Made all the star-worlds dance in a ring!_
2758,SONG,
2759,SONG,"And lo, like a sorrow that melts from the heart"
2760,SONG,"In tears, the slow gates melted apart;"
2761,SONG,And into the City we passed like a dream;
2762,SONG,"And then, in one splendid marching stream"
2763,SONG,The whole of that host came following through.
2764,SONG,"We were only children, just like you;"
2765,SONG,"Children, ah, but we felt so grand"
2766,SONG,As we led them--although we could understand
2767,SONG,Nothing at all of the wonderful song
2768,SONG,That rose all round as we marched along.
2769,SONG,
2770,SONG,
2771,SONG,
2772,SONG,
2773,SONG,SONG
2774,SONG,
2775,SONG,
2776,SONG,_You that have seen how the world and its glory_
2777,SONG,_Change and grow old like the love of a friend;_
2778,SONG,"_You that have come to the end of the story,_"
2779,SONG,_You that were tired ere you came to the end;_
2780,SONG,"_You that are weary of laughter and sorrow,_"
2781,SONG,"_Pain and pleasure, labour and sin,_"
2782,SONG,"_Sick of the midnight and dreading the morrow,_"
2783,SONG,"_Ah, come in; come in._"
2784,SONG,
2785,SONG,_You that are bearing the load of the ages;_
2786,SONG,_You that have loved overmuch and too late;_
2787,SONG,_You that confute all the saws of the sages;_
2788,SONG,"_You that served only because you must wait,_"
2789,SONG,_Knowing your work was a wasted endeavour;_
2790,SONG,"_You that have lost and yet triumphed therein,_"
2791,SONG,_Add loss to your losses and triumph for ever;_
2792,SONG,"_Ah, come in; come in._"
2793,SONG,
2794,SONG,"And we knew as we went up that twisted street,"
2795,SONG,"With its violet shadows and pearl-pale walls,"
2796,SONG,"We were coming to Something strange and sweet,"
2797,SONG,For the dim air echoed with elfin calls;
2798,SONG,"And, far away, in the heart of the City,"
2799,SONG,"A murmur of laughter and revelry rose,--"
2800,SONG,"A sound that was faint as the smile of Pity,"
2801,SONG,And sweet as a swan-song’s golden close.
2802,SONG,
2803,SONG,"And then, once more, as we marched along,"
2804,SONG,There surged all round us that wonderful song;
2805,SONG,And it swung to the tramp of our marching feet;
2806,SONG,"But ah, it was tenderer now and so sweet"
2807,SONG,"That it made our eyes grow wet and blind,"
2808,SONG,"And the whole wide-world seem mother-kind,"
2809,SONG,"Folding us round with a gentle embrace,"
2810,SONG,And pressing our souls to her soft sweet face.
2811,SONG,
2812,SONG,
2813,SONG,
2814,SONG,
2815,SONG,SONG
2816,SONG,
2817,SONG,
2818,SONG,"_Dreams; dreams; ah, the memory blinding us,"
2819,SONG,Blinding our eyes to the way that we go;
2820,SONG,"Till the new sorrow come, once more reminding us"
2821,SONG,"Blindly of kind hearts, ours long ago:"
2822,SONG,"Mother-mine, whisper we, yours was the love for me!"
2823,SONG,"Still, though our paths lie lone and apart,"
2824,SONG,"Yours is the true love, shining above for me,"
2825,SONG,"Yours are the kind eyes, hurting my heart._"
2826,SONG,
2827,SONG,"_Dreams; dreams; ah, how shall we sing of them,_"
2828,SONG,_Dreams that we loved with our head on her breast:_
2829,SONG,_Dreams; dreams; and the cradle-sweet swing of them;_
2830,SONG,"_Ay, for her voice was the sound we loved best:_"
2831,SONG,"_Can we remember at all or, forgetting it,_"
2832,SONG,_Can we recall for a moment the gleam_
2833,SONG,"_Of our childhood’s delight and the wonder begetting it,_"
2834,SONG,_Wonder awakened in dreams of a dream?_
2835,SONG,
2836,SONG,"And, once again, from the heart of the City"
2837,SONG,"A murmur of tenderer laughter rose,"
2838,SONG,"A sound that was faint as the smile of Pity,"
2839,SONG,And sweet as a swan-song’s golden close;
2840,SONG,And it seemed as if some wonderful Fair
2841,SONG,"Were charming the night of the City of Dreams,"
2842,SONG,"For, over the mystical din out there,"
2843,SONG,"The clouds were litten with flickering gleams,"
2844,SONG,And a roseate light like the day’s first flush
2845,SONG,"Quivered and beat on the towers above,"
2846,SONG,And we heard through the curious crooning hush
2847,SONG,An elfin song that we used to love.
2848,SONG,"_Little Boy Blue, come blow up your horn ..._"
2849,SONG,And the soft wind blew it the other way;
2850,SONG,And all that we heard was--_Cow’s in the corn_;
2851,SONG,But we never heard anything half so gay!
2852,SONG,
2853,SONG,And ever we seemed to be drawing nearer
2854,SONG,"That mystical roseate smoke-wreathed glare,"
2855,SONG,"And the curious music grew louder and clearer,"
2856,SONG,"Till _Mustard-Seed_ said, “We are lucky, you see,"
2857,SONG,We’ve arrived at a time of festivity!”
2858,SONG,"And so to the end of the street we came,"
2859,SONG,"And turned a corner, and--there we were,"
2860,SONG,"In a place that glowed like the dawn of day,"
2861,SONG,A crowded clamouring City square
2862,SONG,"Like the cloudy heart of an opal, aflame"
2863,SONG,With the lights of a great Dream-Fair:
2864,SONG,"Thousands of children were gathered there,"
2865,SONG,"Thousands of old men, weary and grey,"
2866,SONG,And the shouts of the showmen filled the air--
2867,SONG,This way! This way! This way!
2868,SONG,
2869,SONG,"And _See-Saw_; _Margery Daw_; we heard a rollicking shout,"
2870,SONG,As the swing-boats hurtled over our heads to the tune of the roundabout;
2871,SONG,"And _Little Boy Blue, come blow up your horn_, we heard the showmen cry,"
2872,SONG,"And _Dickory Dock, I’m as good as a clock_, we heard the swings reply."
2873,SONG,
2874,SONG,"This way, this way to your Heart’s Desire;"
2875,SONG,"Come, cast your burdens down;"
2876,SONG,"And the pauper shall mount his throne in the skies,"
2877,SONG,And the king be rid of his crown:
2878,SONG,And souls that were dead shall be fed with fire
2879,SONG,"From the fount of their ancient pain,"
2880,SONG,And your lost love come with the light in her eyes
2881,SONG,Back to your heart again.
2882,SONG,
2883,SONG,"Ah, here be sure she shall never prove"
2884,SONG,Less kind than her eyes were bright;
2885,SONG,"This way, this way to your old lost love,"
2886,SONG,You shall kiss her lips to-night;
2887,SONG,This way for the smile of a dead man’s face
2888,SONG,"And the grip of a brother’s hand,"
2889,SONG,This way to your childhood’s heart of grace
2890,SONG,And your home in Fairy-land.
2891,SONG,
2892,SONG,"_Dickory Dock, I’m as good as a clock_, d’you hear my swivels chime?"
2893,SONG,"To and fro as I come and go, I keep eternal time."
2894,SONG,"O, little Bo-peep, if you’ve lost your sheep"
2895,SONG,"and don’t know where to find ’em,"
2896,SONG,"Leave ’em alone and they’ll come home, and carry their tails behind ’em."
2897,SONG,
2898,SONG,"And _See-Saw_; _Margery Daw_; there came the chorussing shout,"
2899,SONG,As the swing-boats answered the roaring tune of the rollicking roundabout;
2900,SONG,"Dickory, dickory, dickory, dock, d’you hear my swivels chime?"
2901,SONG,Swing; swing; you’re as good as a king if you keep eternal time.
2902,SONG,
2903,SONG,Then we saw that the tunes of the world were one;
2904,SONG,And the metre that guided the rhythmic sun
2905,SONG,"Was at one, like the ebb and the flow of the sea,"
2906,SONG,With the tunes that we learned at our mother’s knee;
2907,SONG,The beat of the horse-hoofs that carried us down
2908,SONG,To see the fine Lady of Banbury Town;
2909,SONG,"And so, by the rhymes that we knew, we could tell"
2910,SONG,Without knowing the others--that all was well.
2911,SONG,
2912,SONG,"And then, our brains began to spin;"
2913,SONG,For it seemed as if that mighty din
2914,SONG,Were no less than the cries of the poets and sages
2915,SONG,Of all the nations in all the ages;
2916,SONG,"And, if they could only beat out the whole"
2917,SONG,"Of their music together, the guerdon and goal"
2918,SONG,"Of the world would be reached with one mighty shout,"
2919,SONG,And the dark dread secret of Time be out;
2920,SONG,"And nearer, nearer they seemed to climb,"
2921,SONG,"And madder and merrier rose the song,"
2922,SONG,And the swings and the see-saws marked the time;
2923,SONG,For this was the maddest and merriest throng
2924,SONG,That ever was met on a holy-day
2925,SONG,To dance the dust of the world away;
2926,SONG,"And madder and merrier, round and round"
2927,SONG,"The whirligigs whirled to the whirling sound,"
2928,SONG,Till it seemed that the mad song burst its bars
2929,SONG,"And mixed with the song of the whirling stars,"
2930,SONG,The song that the rhythmic Time-Tides tell
2931,SONG,To seraphs in Heaven and devils in Hell;
2932,SONG,Ay; Heaven and Hell in accordant chime
2933,SONG,With the universal rhythm and rhyme
2934,SONG,Were nearing the secret of Space and Time;
2935,SONG,The song of that ultimate mystery
2936,SONG,"Which only the mad blind men who see,"
2937,SONG,"Led by the laugh of a little child,"
2938,SONG,"Can utter; Ay, wilder and yet more wild"
2939,SONG,"It maddened, till now--full song--it was out!"
2940,SONG,It roared from the starry roundabout--
2941,SONG,
2942,SONG,"_A child was born in Bethlehem, in Bethlehem, in Bethlehem,_"
2943,SONG,"_A child was born in Bethlehem; ah, hear my fairy fable;_"
2944,SONG,"_For I have seen the King of Kings, no longer thronged with angel wings,_"
2945,SONG,"_But croodling like a little babe, and cradled in a stable._"
2946,SONG,_The wise men came to greet him with their gifts
2947,SONG,"of myrrh and frankincense,--_"
2948,SONG,_Gold and myrrh and frankincense they brought to make him mirth;_
2949,SONG,"_And would you know the way to win to little brother Peterkin,_"
2950,SONG,_My childhood’s heart shall guide you through the glories of the earth._
2951,SONG,
2952,SONG,"_A child was born in Bethlehem, in Bethlehem, in Bethlehem;_"
2953,SONG,_The wise men came to welcome him: a star stood o’er the gable;_
2954,SONG,"_And there they saw the Kings of Kings, no longer"
2955,SONG,"thronged with angel wings,_"
2956,SONG,"_But croodling like a little babe, and cradled in a stable._"
2957,SONG,
2958,SONG,And creeping through the music once again the fairy cry
2959,SONG,Came freezing o’er the snowy towers to lead us on to Peterkin:
2960,SONG,"Once more the fairy bugles blew from lands beyond the sky,"
2961,SONG,"And we all groped out together, dazed and blind, we knew not why;"
2962,SONG,Out through the City’s farther gates we went to look for Peterkin;
2963,SONG,"Out, out into the dark Unknown, and heard the clamour die"
2964,SONG,"Far, far away behind us as we trotted on to Peterkin."
2965,SONG,
2966,SONG,Then once more along the rare
2967,SONG,Forest-paths we groped our way:
2968,SONG,Here the glow-worm’s league-long glare
2969,SONG,Turned the Wild Thyme night to day:
2970,SONG,There we passed a sort of whale
2971,SONG,"Sixty feet in length or more,"
2972,SONG,But we knew it was a snail
2973,SONG,Even when we heard it snore.
2974,SONG,Often through the glamorous gloom
2975,SONG,Almost on the top of us
2976,SONG,We beheld a beetle loom
2977,SONG,Like a hippopotamus;
2978,SONG,Once or twice a spotted toad
2979,SONG,Like a mountain wobbled by
2980,SONG,With a rolling moon that glowed
2981,SONG,Through the skin-fringe of its eye.
2982,SONG,
2983,SONG,Once a caterpillar bowed
2984,SONG,Down a leaf of Ygdrasil
2985,SONG,Like a sunset-coloured cloud
2986,SONG,Sleeping on a quiet hill:
2987,SONG,Once we came upon a moth
2988,SONG,"Fast asleep with outspread wings,"
2989,SONG,Like a mighty tissued cloth
2990,SONG,Woven for the feet of kings.
2991,SONG,
2992,SONG,There above the woods in state
2993,SONG,Many a temple dome that glows
2994,SONG,Delicately like a great
2995,SONG,Rainbow-coloured bubble rose:
2996,SONG,"Though they were but flowers on earth,"
2997,SONG,"Oh, we dared not enter in;"
2998,SONG,For in that divine re-birth
2999,SONG,Less than awe were more than sin!
3000,SONG,
3001,SONG,Yet their mystic anthems came
3002,SONG,Sweetly to our listening ears;
3003,SONG,And their burden was the same--
3004,SONG,"“No more sorrow, no more tears!"
3005,SONG,Whither Peterkin has gone
3006,SONG,"You, assuredly, shall go:"
3007,SONG,"When your wanderings are done,"
3008,SONG,"All he knows you, too, shall know!”"
3009,SONG,
3010,SONG,So we thought we’d onward roam
3011,SONG,"Till earth’s Smallest Flower appeared,"
3012,SONG,With a less tremendous dome
3013,SONG,Less divinely to be feared:
3014,SONG,"Then, perchance, if we should dare"
3015,SONG,"Timidly to enter in,"
3016,SONG,Might some kindly doorkeeper
3017,SONG,Give us news of Peterkin.
3018,SONG,
3019,SONG,At last we saw a crimson porch
3020,SONG,"Far away, like a dull red torch"
3021,SONG,Burning in the purple gloom;
3022,SONG,And a great ocean of perfume
3023,SONG,"Rolled round us as we drew anear,"
3024,SONG,And then we strangely seemed to hear
3025,SONG,"The shadow of a mighty psalm,"
3026,SONG,A sound as if a golden sea
3027,SONG,Of music swung in utter calm
3028,SONG,Against the shores of Eternity;
3029,SONG,And then we saw the mighty dome
3030,SONG,Of some mysterious Temple tower
3031,SONG,"On high; and knew that we had come,"
3032,SONG,"At last, to that sweet House of Grace"
3033,SONG,Which wise men find in every place--
3034,SONG,The Temple of the Smallest Flower.
3035,SONG,
3036,SONG,And there--alas--our fairy friends
3037,SONG,"Whispered, “Here our kingdom ends:"
3038,SONG,"You must enter in alone,"
3039,SONG,But your souls will surely show
3040,SONG,Whither Peterkin is gone
3041,SONG,And the road that you must go:
3042,SONG,"We, poor fairies, have no souls!"
3043,SONG,"Hark, the warning hare-bell tolls;”"
3044,SONG,"So “Good-bye, good-bye,” they said,"
3045,SONG,“Dear little seekers-for-the-dead.”
3046,SONG,"They vanished; ah, but as they went"
3047,SONG,We heard their voices softly blent
3048,SONG,In some mysterious fairy song
3049,SONG,That seemed to make us wise and strong;
3050,SONG,For it was like the holy calm
3051,SONG,"That fills the bosomed rose with balm,"
3052,SONG,Or blessings that the twilight breathes
3053,SONG,Where the honeysuckle wreathes
3054,SONG,Between young lovers and the sky
3055,SONG,As on banks of flowers they lie;
3056,SONG,And with wings of rose and green
3057,SONG,"Laughing fairies pass unseen,"
3058,SONG,"Singing their sweet lullaby,--"
3059,SONG,Lulla-lulla-lullaby!
3060,SONG,Lulla-lulla-lullaby!
3061,SONG,"Ah, good night, with lullaby!"
3062,SONG,
3063,SONG,*       *       *       *       *
3064,SONG,
3065,SONG,"Only a flower? Those carven walls,"
3066,SONG,"Those cornices and coronals,"
3067,SONG,"The splendid crimson porch, the thin"
3068,SONG,Strange sounds of singing from within--
3069,SONG,"Through the scented arch we stept,"
3070,SONG,"Pushed back the soft petallic door,"
3071,SONG,And down the velvet aisles we crept;
3072,SONG,Was it a Flower--no more?
3073,SONG,
3074,SONG,"For one of the voices that we heard,"
3075,SONG,"A child’s voice, clear as the voice of a bird,"
3076,SONG,"Was it not?--nay, it could not be!"
3077,SONG,And a woman’s voice that tenderly
3078,SONG,"Answered him in fond refrain,"
3079,SONG,"And pierced our hearts with sweet sweet pain,"
3080,SONG,As if dear Mary-mother hung
3081,SONG,"Above some little child, and sung"
3082,SONG,Between the waves of that golden sea
3083,SONG,The cradle-songs of Eternity;
3084,SONG,"And, while in her deep smile he basked,"
3085,SONG,Answered whatsoe’er he asked.
3086,SONG,
3087,SONG,"_What is there hid in the heart of a rose,_"
3088,SONG,_Mother-mine?_
3089,SONG,"_Ah, who knows, who knows, who knows?_"
3090,SONG,_A man that died on a lonely hill_
3091,SONG,"_May tell you, perhaps, but none other will,_"
3092,SONG,_Little child._
3093,SONG,
3094,SONG,"_What does it take to make a rose,_"
3095,SONG,_Mother-mine?_
3096,SONG,_The God that died to make it knows_
3097,SONG,"_It takes the world’s eternal wars,_"
3098,SONG,"_It takes the moon and all the stars,_"
3099,SONG,_It takes the might of heaven and hell_
3100,SONG,"_And the everlasting Love as well,_"
3101,SONG,_Little child._
3102,SONG,
3103,SONG,"But there, in one great shrine apart"
3104,SONG,"Within the Temple’s holiest heart,"
3105,SONG,"We came upon a blinding light,"
3106,SONG,"Suddenly, and a burning throne"
3107,SONG,"Of pinnacled glory, wild and white;"
3108,SONG,We could not see Who reigned thereon;
3109,SONG,"For, all at once, as a wood-bird sings,"
3110,SONG,The aisles were full of great white wings
3111,SONG,Row above mystic burning row;
3112,SONG,And through the splendour and the glow
3113,SONG,"We saw four angels, great and sweet,"
3114,SONG,"With outspread wings and folded feet,"
3115,SONG,Come gliding down from a heaven within
3116,SONG,The golden heart of Paradise;
3117,SONG,"And in their hands, with laughing eyes,"
3118,SONG,Lay little brother Peterkin.
3119,SONG,
3120,SONG,And all around the Temple of the Smallest of the Flowers
3121,SONG,The glory of the angels made a star for little Peterkin;
3122,SONG,For all the Kings of Splendour and all the Heavenly Powers
3123,SONG,Were gathered there together in the fairy forest bowers
3124,SONG,"With all their globed and radiant wings to make a star for Peterkin,"
3125,SONG,"The star that shone upon the East, a star that still is ours,"
3126,SONG,"Whene’er we hang our stockings up, a star of wings for Peterkin."
3127,SONG,
3128,SONG,"Then all, in one great flash, was gone--"
3129,SONG,"A voice cried, “Hush, all’s well!”"
3130,SONG,"And we stood dreaming there alone,"
3131,SONG,In darkness. Who can tell
3132,SONG,"The mystic quiet that we felt,"
3133,SONG,"As if the woods in worship knelt,"
3134,SONG,Far off we heard a bell
3135,SONG,Tolling strange human folk to prayer
3136,SONG,Through fields of sunset-coloured air.
3137,SONG,
3138,SONG,"And then a voice, “Why, here they are!”"
3139,SONG,And--as it seemed--we woke;
3140,SONG,"The sweet old skies, great star by star"
3141,SONG,Upon our vision broke;
3142,SONG,Field over field of heavenly blue
3143,SONG,Rose o’er us; then a voice we knew
3144,SONG,Softly and gently spoke--
3145,SONG,"“See, they are sleeping by the side"
3146,SONG,Of that dear little one--who died.”

3154,THE HAPPY ENDING,
3155,THE HAPPY ENDING,
3156,THE HAPPY ENDING,We told dear father all our tale
3157,THE HAPPY ENDING,"That night before we went to bed,"
3158,THE HAPPY ENDING,"And at the end his face grew pale,"
3159,THE HAPPY ENDING,And he bent over us and said
3160,THE HAPPY ENDING,"(Was it not strange?) he, too, was there,"
3161,THE HAPPY ENDING,"A weary, weary watch to keep"
3162,THE HAPPY ENDING,Before the gates of the City of Sleep;
3163,THE HAPPY ENDING,"But, ere we came, he did not dare"
3164,THE HAPPY ENDING,"Even to dream of entering in,"
3165,THE HAPPY ENDING,Or even to hope for Peterkin.
3166,THE HAPPY ENDING,"He was the poor blind man, he said,"
3167,THE HAPPY ENDING,And we--how low he bent his head!
3168,THE HAPPY ENDING,Then he called mother near; and low
3169,THE HAPPY ENDING,He whispered to us--“Prompt me now;
3170,THE HAPPY ENDING,"For I forget that song we heard,"
3171,THE HAPPY ENDING,But you remember every word.”
3172,THE HAPPY ENDING,"Then memory came like a breaking morn,"
3173,THE HAPPY ENDING,And we breathed it to him--_A child was born!_
3174,THE HAPPY ENDING,And there he drew us to his breast
3175,THE HAPPY ENDING,And softly murmured all the rest.--
3176,THE HAPPY ENDING,
3177,THE HAPPY ENDING,_The wise men came to greet him with their gifts
3178,THE HAPPY ENDING,"of myrrh and frankincense,--_"
3179,THE HAPPY ENDING,_Gold and myrrh and frankincense they brought to make him mirth;_
3180,THE HAPPY ENDING,"_And would you know the way to win to little brother Peterkin,_"
3181,THE HAPPY ENDING,_My childhood’s heart shall guide you through the glories of the earth._
3182,THE HAPPY ENDING,
3183,THE HAPPY ENDING,Then he looked up and mother knelt
3184,THE HAPPY ENDING,"Beside us, oh, her eyes were bright;"
3185,THE HAPPY ENDING,Her arms were like a lovely belt
3186,THE HAPPY ENDING,All round us as we said Good-night
3187,THE HAPPY ENDING,"To father: _he_ was crying now,"
3188,THE HAPPY ENDING,"But they were happy tears, somehow;"
3189,THE HAPPY ENDING,For there we saw dear mother lay
3190,THE HAPPY ENDING,Her cheek against his cheek and say--
3191,THE HAPPY ENDING,"Hush, let me kiss those tears away."

3278,BY ALFRED NOYES,Noyes at his best.... Two considerations render Mr. Noyes interesting
3279,BY ALFRED NOYES,above most poets: the wonderful degree in which the personal charm
3280,BY ALFRED NOYES,"illumines what he has already written, and the surprises which one feels"
3281,BY ALFRED NOYES,may be in store in his future work. His feelings have already so much
3282,BY ALFRED NOYES,variety and so much apparent sincerity that it is impossible to tell in
