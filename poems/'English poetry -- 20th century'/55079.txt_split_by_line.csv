55,MY WIFE,_We two have seen with our own eyes
56,MY WIFE,God’s multitudinous disguise;
57,MY WIFE,Waylaid Him in His voyaging
58,MY WIFE,Among the buttercups of Spring;
59,MY WIFE,In valleys where the lilies shone
60,MY WIFE,More glorious than Solomon
61,MY WIFE,"We met a poet passing by,"
62,MY WIFE,And learned his lyric--you and I!_
63,MY WIFE,
64,MY WIFE,_But oh! did kindly Heaven not bless
65,MY WIFE,"Our lives with more than loveliness,"
66,MY WIFE,"When, cast on every sapling-rod,"
67,MY WIFE,Was seen the motley of our God;
68,MY WIFE,When having picked our way with craft
69,MY WIFE,"Up cliffs to hear Him when He laughed,"
70,MY WIFE,"We felt, uplifted on the wind,"
71,MY WIFE,His folly blown into our mind?_
72,MY WIFE,
73,MY WIFE,_What doubt can touch us? We have heard
74,MY WIFE,The baby laughter of the Word!
75,MY WIFE,We mingle with solemnity
76,MY WIFE,A Catholic note of revelry
77,MY WIFE,In hypostatic union.
78,MY WIFE,From love’s carved choir-stalls we con
79,MY WIFE,The plain-song of the Breviary
80,MY WIFE,Illumined by hilarity.
81,MY WIFE,For as each cleansing sacrament
82,MY WIFE,To our soul’s comforting was sent
83,MY WIFE,"(Through water and oil and wheat and wine,"
84,MY WIFE,"Bringing to human the divine),"
85,MY WIFE,So shall we find on lovers’ lips
86,MY WIFE,"The splendour of apocalypse,"
87,MY WIFE,And through the body’s five gates come
88,MY WIFE,To all the good of Christendom._
89,MY WIFE,
90,MY WIFE,_We have no fear that we shall lose
91,MY WIFE,"This joyous Gospel of good news,"
92,MY WIFE,For our symbolic love has stood
93,MY WIFE,By virtue of its fortitude--
94,MY WIFE,"Knowing a bitter Lenten fast,"
95,MY WIFE,"Satan discomforted at last,"
96,MY WIFE,"A bowed back scalding with great scars,"
97,MY WIFE,"Gethsemane of tears and stars,"
98,MY WIFE,"A journey of the cross, and ah,"
99,MY WIFE,Its part and lot in Golgotha!_
100,MY WIFE,
101,MY WIFE,_We know--let the marvellous thing be said!--
102,MY WIFE,Love’s resurrection from the dead ...
103,MY WIFE,For as Magdalen came with cinnamon
104,MY WIFE,"And aloes to smear Love’s limbs upon,"
105,MY WIFE,But met alone on the Easter grass
106,MY WIFE,"Life’s Lord, though she wist not Who He was--"
107,MY WIFE,"So we, till He spoke as He spoke to her,"
108,MY WIFE,Mistook Him for the gardener._

118,NOTE,This edition of Theodore Maynard’s poems represents the author’s own
119,NOTE,selection of such of his published verse as he wishes included in a
120,NOTE,"permanent collection. With few omissions, it represents the contents of"
121,NOTE,"the three volumes issued in Great Britain under the titles, “_Laughs and"
122,NOTE,"Whifts of Song_,” 1915; “_Drums of Defeat_,” 1917; “_Folly_,” 1918, none"
123,NOTE,of which has hitherto been published in this country.

129,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,
130,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,
131,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"In the case of any poet who has caught and held our recollection, there"
132,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"is generally a particular piece of work which remains in our mind, not"
133,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"as the crown, but as the key. And ever since I saw in _The New Witness_"
134,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"some lines called “A Song of Colours,” by Theodore Maynard, they have"
135,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"remained to me as a sort of simplification, or permanent element, of the"
136,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,rest of the poet’s writings; and I have felt him especially as a poet of
137,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,colour. They are not by any means the best of his lines. They are
138,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"direct, as is appropriate to a ballad; and they have none of the fine"
139,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,whimsicality or the frank humour to be found elsewhere in his work.
140,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,Among these others the choice is hard: but I should say that the finest
141,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"poetry as such is to be found in the images, and even in the very title,"
142,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,of “The World’s Miser”: and even more in the poem called “Apocalypse.”
143,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,In this latter the poet imagines a new world which shall be supernatural
144,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,in the strongest sense of the word; that of being more vivid and
145,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,positive than the natural; and not (as it is so often imagined) more
146,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,tenuous and void.
147,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,
148,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,“Or what empurpled blooms to oust the rose
149,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,Or what strange grass to glow like angels’ hair!”
150,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,
151,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"The last line has the touch of the true mystic, which changes a thing"
152,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"and yet leaves it familiar. True artistic pugnacity, a thing that"
153,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"generally goes with true artistic pleasure, is well-expressed in the"
154,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,shrewd lines of the poem printed as a sequel to another poem called “To
155,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"a Good Atheist.” The sequel is called “To a Bad Atheist,” with the"
156,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,charming explanation: “Who wrote what he called a trinity of meek
157,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"retorts to the preceding poem, which were not meek, but full of pride"
158,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,and abominable heresy.” He describes the bad atheist’s mind as
159,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"containing nothing but sawdust, sun and sand; which is accurate and"
160,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"exhaustive. And in so far as poetry appeals to particular temperaments,"
161,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,I myself find enjoyment expecially in the part of the collection
162,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,properly to be called “Laughs”; in the ballads of feasting and
163,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,fellowship; and especially in that sublime absolution gravely offered to
164,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,the Duke of Norfolk.
165,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,
166,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,But the sentiment of colour still ran like a thread through the whole
167,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,texture; and I think there is hardly a poem that does not repeat it. And
168,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,this is important; because the whole of Mr. Maynard’s inspiration is
169,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,part of what is the main business of our time: the resurrection of the
170,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"Middle Ages. The modern movement, with its Guild Socialism and its"
171,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"military reaction against the fatalism of the Barbarian, is as certainly"
172,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"drawing its life from the lost centuries of Catholic Europe, as the"
173,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,movement more commonly called the Renaissance drew its life from the
174,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"lost languages and sculptures of antiquity. And, by a quaint"
175,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"inconsistency, Hellenists and Neo-Pagans of the school of Mr. Lowes"
176,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,Dickinson will call us antiquated for gathering the flowers which still
177,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"grow on the graves of our mediæval ancestors, while they themselves will"
178,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,industriously search for the scattered ashes from the more distant pyres
179,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,of the Pagans.
180,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,
181,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,And the visible clue to the Middle Ages is colour. The mediæval man
182,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,could paint before he could draw. In the almost startling inspiration
183,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"which we call stained glass, he discovered something that is almost more"
184,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,coloured than colour; something that bears the same relation to mere
185,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"colour that golden flame does to golden sand. He did not, like other"
186,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"artists, try in his pictures to paint the sun; he made the sun paint his"
187,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,pictures. He mixed the aboriginal light with the paints upon his
188,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,palette. And it is this translucent actuality of colour which I feel in
189,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"the phraseology of this writer, in a way it is not easy to analyse. We"
190,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,can only say that when he says--
191,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,
192,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,“Among the yellow primroses
193,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,He holds His summer palaces”
194,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,
195,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"we have an impression, which it is the object of all poetry to produce."
196,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,It can only be described by saying that a primrose by the river’s brim a
197,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"_yellow_ primrose is to him, and it could not possibly be anything more."
198,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,And this almost torrid directness and distinctness of tint is again
199,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,connected with another quality of the poet and his poetic tradition:
200,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,what many would call asceticism alternating with what many would call
201,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,buffoonery. The colour conventions of the Middle Ages were copied very
202,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,beautifully by the school of Rossetti and Swinburne. But they lost the
203,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,exuberance of the Gothic and became a pattern rather than a plan;
204,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,chiefly because they were not seriously inspired by any of the
205,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,enthusiasms of the Middle Ages. Its decorative repetitions sometimes
206,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,became quite dreary and artificial; as in Swinburne’s unfortunate
207,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,couplet about the lilies and languors of virtue and the raptures and
208,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,roses of vice. A little healthy gardening would have taught Swinburne
209,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,that it takes quite as much virtue to grow a rose as to grow a lily. It
210,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"might also have taught him that virtue is never languid, whatever else"
211,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,it may be: and that even lilies are not really languid so long as they
212,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,are alive. If such decadents want an image of what it really is that
213,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"holds up the heads of lilies or any other growing things, I can refer"
214,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"them to a couplet in this little volume, which is more beautiful and"
215,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,more original and means a great deal more--
216,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,
217,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,“What wilful trees of any spring
218,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,Than your young body are more fair?”
219,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,
220,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,These lines contain a principle of life and mark the end of a pagan
221,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"sterility. They contain the secret, not of gathering rosebuds while we"
222,ON THEODORE MAYNARD’S POEMS,"may, but of growing them when we choose."

3316,GRATITUDE,Or when each separate twig did lie
3317,GRATITUDE,Etched sharp upon the wintry sky.
3318,GRATITUDE,If out of all my sunny hours
3319,GRATITUDE,I brought no chaplet of their flowers;

3842,CERTAINTIES,"And laughter and the ring of friendly words,"
3843,CERTAINTIES,And the noon’s pageant moving languidly.
3844,CERTAINTIES,"I walk again with boys now grown to men,"
3845,CERTAINTIES,"And see far off with reminiscent eyes,"
3846,CERTAINTIES,How in the tangled woods of Horsmonden
