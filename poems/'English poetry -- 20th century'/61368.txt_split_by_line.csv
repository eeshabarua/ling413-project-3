235,PRELUDE,
236,PRELUDE,We have wandered through the dim valleys of sleep
237,PRELUDE,--That lie so still and far--
238,PRELUDE,"Have bathed in the lakes of silence,"
239,PRELUDE,Where each star
240,PRELUDE,Shines brighter than its own reflection in the heavens;
241,PRELUDE,"Where, diving deep,"
242,PRELUDE,My soul has sought to catch and keep
243,PRELUDE,The silver feathers of the moon
244,PRELUDE,"That float like down upon the waters,"
245,PRELUDE,In whose pale rest
246,PRELUDE,We find
247,PRELUDE,Forgetfulness of death
248,PRELUDE,That comes so soon
249,PRELUDE,--Waters that lull the mind
250,PRELUDE,With some sweet breath
251,PRELUDE,"Of wind, of flowers,"
252,PRELUDE,"With summer showers of rain,"
253,PRELUDE,Or quicken it with recreative pain.
254,PRELUDE,
255,PRELUDE,"We have fled further from this leaden cage,"
256,PRELUDE,"Seeking those rainbow forests,"
257,PRELUDE,Where the light
258,PRELUDE,"Thrills through you, shaking, fainting, with delight;"
259,PRELUDE,Where sway tall luminous trees
260,PRELUDE,"Wind-swept in one vast flashing harmony,"
261,PRELUDE,That like a wave
262,PRELUDE,Splashes its seething sound
263,PRELUDE,And then envelops you.
264,PRELUDE,
265,PRELUDE,"We have strayed to other places,"
266,PRELUDE,"Courts of fear,"
267,PRELUDE,That stretch like echoes through the endless dusk
268,PRELUDE,Drenched with dead memories;
269,PRELUDE,Like musk
270,PRELUDE,They cling about you
271,PRELUDE,In a heavy cloud.
272,PRELUDE,Each shadow-sound we hear
273,PRELUDE,Clutches the heart.
274,PRELUDE,With fevered hands we tear
275,PRELUDE,The terror-pulsing walls
276,PRELUDE,--Fight our way out
277,PRELUDE,--Out
278,PRELUDE,Into other Courts
279,PRELUDE,As vague and full of fear.
280,PRELUDE,And we have found the proud and distant palaces of night.

285,THE SILENCE OF GOD,THE SILENCE OF GOD
286,THE SILENCE OF GOD,
287,THE SILENCE OF GOD,One night upon the southern sea
288,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"In helpless calm we lay,"
289,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"Waiting for day,"
290,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Waiting for day.
291,THE SILENCE OF GOD,
292,THE SILENCE OF GOD,As goldripe fruit fall from a tree
293,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"A comet fell; no other sight,"
294,THE SILENCE OF GOD,But in the ocean tracks of light
295,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"Trembled--then passed away,"
296,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Away.
297,THE SILENCE OF GOD,
298,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"No sound broke on our waiting ears,"
299,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Though instinct whispered wayward fears
300,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Of things we cannot tell--
301,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Of things the sea could tell.
302,THE SILENCE OF GOD,
303,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"No wisp of wind, no watery sound"
304,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Reached us; as if high on the ground
305,THE SILENCE OF GOD,We stayed.  A sense of fever fell
306,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"Upon each mind,"
307,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Each soul and mind.
308,THE SILENCE OF GOD,
309,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"Until our eyes, that ever sought"
310,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"The cloying empty darkness, find"
311,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Another shape--or is it wrought
312,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Of terror?--on the deep
313,THE SILENCE OF GOD,The endless deep.
314,THE SILENCE OF GOD,
315,THE SILENCE OF GOD,All dark it lay.  No light shone out;
316,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"And though we cried across, no shout"
317,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Came back to us.  As if in sleep
318,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"The black bulk lay so still,"
319,THE SILENCE OF GOD,So still.
320,THE SILENCE OF GOD,
321,THE SILENCE OF GOD,No sign came back; no answering cry
322,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Cleft the immense monotony
323,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"That swathed us like a funeral pall,"
324,THE SILENCE OF GOD,In folds of menace; almost shrill
325,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"The silence seemed,"
326,THE SILENCE OF GOD,And we so small.
327,THE SILENCE OF GOD,
328,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Swiftly a boat was lowered down;
329,THE SILENCE OF GOD,The rowlocks creaked; our track shone white
330,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"Behind us like God's frown,"
331,THE SILENCE OF GOD,God's frown.
332,THE SILENCE OF GOD,
333,THE SILENCE OF GOD,We clambered up that great ship's height;
334,THE SILENCE OF GOD,There was no light; there was no sound;
335,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Nor was there any being found
336,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"Upon that ship,"
337,THE SILENCE OF GOD,That ship.
338,THE SILENCE OF GOD,
339,THE SILENCE OF GOD,We groped our way along.  God knows
340,THE SILENCE OF GOD,How long the rats had been alone
341,THE SILENCE OF GOD,With dust and rust!  Yet flight was shown
342,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"To have been instant, in the grip"
343,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Of some force stronger than its foes
344,THE SILENCE OF GOD,--Its human foes.
345,THE SILENCE OF GOD,
346,THE SILENCE OF GOD,* * * * *
347,THE SILENCE OF GOD,
348,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Then sudden from the dark there thrilled
349,THE SILENCE OF GOD,The distant dying of a song
350,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"That hung like haze upon the sea, and filled"
351,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"Each soul with joy and terror strong,"
352,THE SILENCE OF GOD,With joy and terror strong.
353,THE SILENCE OF GOD,
354,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Upon the sombre air were spent
355,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"These notes, as from a hidden place"
356,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Where all time and all love lay pent
357,THE SILENCE OF GOD,In lingering embrace--
358,THE SILENCE OF GOD,In lingering embrace.
359,THE SILENCE OF GOD,
360,THE SILENCE OF GOD,Deep in our hearts we felt the call;
361,THE SILENCE OF GOD,We knew that if our fate should send
362,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"That song again, we must leave all"
363,THE SILENCE OF GOD,"And follow to the end,"
364,THE SILENCE OF GOD,The end.

369,ADVENTURE,ADVENTURE
370,ADVENTURE,
371,ADVENTURE,"Down through the torrid seas we swept,"
372,ADVENTURE,Sails curved like bows about to shoot.
373,ADVENTURE,As an arrow speeds through the air
374,ADVENTURE,Our ship parted the clinging waters.
375,ADVENTURE,
376,ADVENTURE,"Then, out of the ocean"
377,ADVENTURE,Blossomed a distant land.
378,ADVENTURE,
379,ADVENTURE,* * * * *
380,ADVENTURE,
381,ADVENTURE,"The air quivered,"
382,ADVENTURE,Dancing above it
383,ADVENTURE,In a frenzy of passion.
384,ADVENTURE,Waves of heat trembled towards us
385,ADVENTURE,Across the cool lassitude of the ocean.
386,ADVENTURE,"They rolled new odours at us,"
387,ADVENTURE,"Sounding the chords of hidden senses,"
388,ADVENTURE,Till we were alert
389,ADVENTURE,With minds as sensitive and taut
390,ADVENTURE,As resined strings.
391,ADVENTURE,The sea itself
392,ADVENTURE,"Crouched down behind us,"
393,ADVENTURE,"Urging us on,"
394,ADVENTURE,"Driving us on,"
395,ADVENTURE,To unknown
396,ADVENTURE,Perilous adventures.
397,ADVENTURE,
398,ADVENTURE,* * * * *
399,ADVENTURE,
400,ADVENTURE,Ships and sea were forgotten.
401,ADVENTURE,We trampled
402,ADVENTURE,And stumbled
403,ADVENTURE,"On, on,"
404,ADVENTURE,Through the burning sand
405,ADVENTURE,"To the hot shroud of the squat threatening forest,"
406,ADVENTURE,"Where, as you walked,"
407,ADVENTURE,You tore apart
408,ADVENTURE,A solid sheet of air.
409,ADVENTURE,
410,ADVENTURE,"Brown satyrs grimaced at us,"
411,ADVENTURE,Swinging with long hairy arms
412,ADVENTURE,From crooked branch to crooked branch.
413,ADVENTURE,The sun
414,ADVENTURE,Was at its height.
415,ADVENTURE,Rays pierced the hot shade;
416,ADVENTURE,White lines of light
417,ADVENTURE,Shot through the shadows
418,ADVENTURE,To where a point of green
419,ADVENTURE,"Shuddered with dangerous movement,"
420,ADVENTURE,Throbbed and hummed with the whirr of insects.
421,ADVENTURE,Birds more bright than any streamers from the sun
422,ADVENTURE,Cleft the air
423,ADVENTURE,Like hammers;
424,ADVENTURE,Scintillating wings
425,ADVENTURE,Tossed patches of colour
426,ADVENTURE,Into the dark shimmering air.
427,ADVENTURE,Shrill calls
428,ADVENTURE,Whistled like knives
429,ADVENTURE,Hurled through the empty heat.
430,ADVENTURE,
431,ADVENTURE,Frantic chattering rose up.
432,ADVENTURE,Through the honeycombed darkness
433,ADVENTURE,Slim animals
434,ADVENTURE,--Their hides splashed with false sunlight--
435,ADVENTURE,Quivered away
436,ADVENTURE,Into the hollow distance.
437,ADVENTURE,"Or clattered past us,"
438,ADVENTURE,Cloven hooves
439,ADVENTURE,"Kicking at the hard, bent trunks"
440,ADVENTURE,Of gnarled trees.
441,ADVENTURE,Large hairy fruits of wood
442,ADVENTURE,"Were cast at us,"
443,ADVENTURE,"Snarlingly,"
444,ADVENTURE,From the darkness.
445,ADVENTURE,Faces
446,ADVENTURE,--Faces peered down
447,ADVENTURE,From the interwoven boughs.
448,ADVENTURE,
449,ADVENTURE,Hastily we stumbled on;
450,ADVENTURE,"Hurriedly we stumbled back,"
451,ADVENTURE,Bewildered.
452,ADVENTURE,Small tracks
453,ADVENTURE,Tripped through the blackness
454,ADVENTURE,Hither and thither;
455,ADVENTURE,"Twigs crawled from under our feet,"
456,ADVENTURE,Hissing away
457,ADVENTURE,In venom
458,ADVENTURE,--And we were bewildered.
459,ADVENTURE,
460,ADVENTURE,Then suddenly
461,ADVENTURE,"We felt,"
462,ADVENTURE,"Rumbling in curling patterns through the ground,"
463,ADVENTURE,The beating of drums.
464,ADVENTURE,"As winds bellow into caves,"
465,ADVENTURE,"As waves swirl and curl into hollows,"
466,ADVENTURE,We heard the blowing of wooden trumpets
467,ADVENTURE,And of pipes.
468,ADVENTURE,
469,ADVENTURE,"Soon,"
470,ADVENTURE,"Under the western canopy of the sun,"
471,ADVENTURE,"Where the fevered hills lay huddled together,"
472,ADVENTURE,We saw great gourd-shaped palaces
473,ADVENTURE,Loom up like mountains.
474,ADVENTURE,"Figures played on trumpets,"
475,ADVENTURE,"Twisted like snakes,"
476,ADVENTURE,"Or on the curved, carved horns of unknown beasts."
477,ADVENTURE,In the sound was mirrored
478,ADVENTURE,"The panic seizures of the night,"
479,ADVENTURE,--The fear of things that walk in darkness.
480,ADVENTURE,The drums were painted
481,ADVENTURE,In hot colours
482,ADVENTURE,"That, even through the dusk,"
483,ADVENTURE,Glowed torture and writhing torment.
484,ADVENTURE,Like a shower of molten lead
485,ADVENTURE,The din fell down upon us
486,ADVENTURE,From the Palaces.
487,ADVENTURE,
488,ADVENTURE,Bare yellow women
489,ADVENTURE,Hurried
490,ADVENTURE,To greet us;
491,ADVENTURE,Their heels swayed inward
492,ADVENTURE,As they walked.
493,ADVENTURE,They offered fruits
494,ADVENTURE,--Fruits that were strange to us;
495,ADVENTURE,"Mellow they were, and with a scent"
496,ADVENTURE,"Of sun, of summer,"
497,ADVENTURE,And of woodland nights.
498,ADVENTURE,We ate
499,ADVENTURE,--And dreams closed round.

512,DUSK,Solitary plumes

530,SAILOR-SONG,On swinging seas our ship has flown
531,SAILOR-SONG,--In sun and shadow lands alit.
532,SAILOR-SONG,We saw the sack of Carthage Town
533,SAILOR-SONG,(And Dido building it).
534,SAILOR-SONG,
535,SAILOR-SONG,"Cassandra, direful prophetess,"
536,SAILOR-SONG,"We heard foretell the fate of Troy,"
537,SAILOR-SONG,And through its streets helped wheel and press
538,SAILOR-SONG,"That wooden, painted toy."
539,SAILOR-SONG,
540,SAILOR-SONG,We've seen events aboard this hulk
541,SAILOR-SONG,Of grave import and mystery
542,SAILOR-SONG,--The serpent's writhing horrid bulk
543,SAILOR-SONG,Go seething through the sea.
544,SAILOR-SONG,
545,SAILOR-SONG,Then once we left Atlantis Town.
546,SAILOR-SONG,Behind us like a lily flower
547,SAILOR-SONG,"It blossomed; but then down, far down,"
548,SAILOR-SONG,Sank every vane and tower.
549,SAILOR-SONG,
550,SAILOR-SONG,Now you can hear the clanging beat
551,SAILOR-SONG,Of bells beneath the furious foam.
552,SAILOR-SONG,In coral palaces the great
553,SAILOR-SONG,Sea monsters make their home.
554,SAILOR-SONG,
555,SAILOR-SONG,Their corridors with pearl are pav'd;
556,SAILOR-SONG,Float down them in an endless flight
557,SAILOR-SONG,Fierce finny beasts.  The walls are laved
558,SAILOR-SONG,In irridescent light.
559,SAILOR-SONG,
560,SAILOR-SONG,We brought gifts--myrrh and frankincense--
561,SAILOR-SONG,From Khubla to the Great Moghul;
562,SAILOR-SONG,Espied the Juggernaut immense
563,SAILOR-SONG,Pound over flesh and skull;
564,SAILOR-SONG,
565,SAILOR-SONG,Saw desert-men atone for ills
566,SAILOR-SONG,"With frenzied hands, with wounds that gape,"
567,SAILOR-SONG,--The hermits hidden in the hills
568,SAILOR-SONG,--The Herod in his Tyrian Cape.
569,SAILOR-SONG,
570,SAILOR-SONG,"From out our ship, held fast by gale,"
571,SAILOR-SONG,We watched Andromeda's release;
572,SAILOR-SONG,Beheld the galleon in full sail
573,SAILOR-SONG,That flew the Golden Fleece.
574,SAILOR-SONG,
575,SAILOR-SONG,"Icarus, proud of his new power,"
576,SAILOR-SONG,We saw stretch out his wings to fly.
577,SAILOR-SONG,We heard in that tremendous hour
578,SAILOR-SONG,The cry from Calvary.
579,SAILOR-SONG,
580,SAILOR-SONG,Thus many things we understand
581,SAILOR-SONG,That puzzle landsmen: we can tell
582,SAILOR-SONG,Of perils in each time and land;
583,SAILOR-SONG,But outside Heaven or Hell
584,SAILOR-SONG,
585,SAILOR-SONG,No fruit so strange we tasted save

704,CORNUCOPIA,
705,CORNUCOPIA,Now music fills the night with moving shades;
706,CORNUCOPIA,"Its velvet darkness, veined like a grape,"
707,CORNUCOPIA,Obscures and falls round many a subtle shape
708,CORNUCOPIA,"--Figures that steal through cool tall colonnades,"
709,CORNUCOPIA,Vast minotaurian corridors of sleep;
710,CORNUCOPIA,"Rhythmic they pass us, splashed by red cascades"
711,CORNUCOPIA,"Of wine, fierce-flashing fountains whose proud waves"
712,CORNUCOPIA,Shimmer awhile; plunge foaming over steep
713,CORNUCOPIA,"Age-polished rocks, into the dim cold caves"
714,CORNUCOPIA,"Of starlit dusk below--then merge with night,"
715,CORNUCOPIA,Softly as children sinking into sleep.
716,CORNUCOPIA,
717,CORNUCOPIA,But now more figures sway into our sight;
718,CORNUCOPIA,"Strong and bare-shouldered, pressed and laden down,"
719,CORNUCOPIA,Stagger across the terraces.  They bear
720,CORNUCOPIA,Great Cornucopia of summer fruit
721,CORNUCOPIA,And heavy roses scented with the noon
722,CORNUCOPIA,"--Piled up with fruit and blossoms, all full blown,"
723,CORNUCOPIA,"Crimson, or golden as the harvest moon--"
724,CORNUCOPIA,Piled up and overflowing in a flood
725,CORNUCOPIA,"Of riches; brilliant-plumaged birds, that sing"
726,CORNUCOPIA,"As the faint playing on a far sweet lute,"
727,CORNUCOPIA,Warble their tales of conquest and of love;
728,CORNUCOPIA,Perch on each shoulder; sweep each rainbow wing
729,CORNUCOPIA,Like light'ning through the breathless dark above.
730,CORNUCOPIA,Heaped up in vases gems shine hard and bright;
731,CORNUCOPIA,Sudden they flare out--gleaming red like blood--
732,CORNUCOPIA,"For now the darkness turns to swelling light,"
733,CORNUCOPIA,"Great torches gild each shadow, tear the sky,"
734,CORNUCOPIA,As drums tear through the silence of the night;
735,CORNUCOPIA,Breaking its crystal quiet--making us cry
736,CORNUCOPIA,Or catch our sobbing breath in sudden fear.
737,CORNUCOPIA,"A shadow stumbles, and the jewels shower"
738,CORNUCOPIA,On to the pavers with a sharp sweet sound.
739,CORNUCOPIA,They mingle with the fountain drops that flower
740,CORNUCOPIA,"Up in a scarlet bloom above the ground,"
741,CORNUCOPIA,A beauteous changing blossom; then they rain
742,CORNUCOPIA,"On to the broad mysterious terraces,"
743,CORNUCOPIA,Where sea-gods rise to watch in cold disdain
744,CORNUCOPIA,"Before those vast vermillion palaces,"
745,CORNUCOPIA,"--Watch where the slumbering coral gods of noon,"
746,CORNUCOPIA,Drunk with the sudden golden light and flare
747,CORNUCOPIA,"Of flaming torches, try to pluck and tear"
748,CORNUCOPIA,"That wan enchanted lotus flower, the moon,"
749,CORNUCOPIA,"Down from its calm still waters; thus they fall,"
750,CORNUCOPIA,"Like flowing plumes, the fountains of our festival."
751,CORNUCOPIA,
752,CORNUCOPIA,"Slowly the torches die.  They echo long,"
753,CORNUCOPIA,"These last notes of a Bacchanalian song,"
754,CORNUCOPIA,"Of drifting drowsy beauty, born of sleep,"
755,CORNUCOPIA,"--Vast as the sea, as changing and as deep."
756,CORNUCOPIA,In thanksgiving for shelt'ring summer skies
757,CORNUCOPIA,"Still, far away, a fervent red light glows."
758,CORNUCOPIA,"Small winds brush past against our lips and eyes,"
759,CORNUCOPIA,"Caress them like a laughing summer rose,"
760,CORNUCOPIA,"And rainbow moths flit by, in circling flight."
761,CORNUCOPIA,A harp sobs out its crystal syruppings;
762,CORNUCOPIA,"Faintly it sounds, as the poor petal-wings,"
763,CORNUCOPIA,"Fragile yet radiant, of a butterfly"
764,CORNUCOPIA,Beating against the barriers of night.
765,CORNUCOPIA,
766,CORNUCOPIA,"Then from the Ocean came the Syren song,"
767,CORNUCOPIA,"Heavy with perfume, yet faint as a sigh,"
768,CORNUCOPIA,"Kissing our minds, and changing right from wrong;"
769,CORNUCOPIA,Chaining our limbs; making our bodies seem

776,CORNUCOPIA,"We, listening, rejoice."
777,CORNUCOPIA,The magic strains
778,CORNUCOPIA,Swell in this darkness star-devoid.
779,CORNUCOPIA,The music streams
780,CORNUCOPIA,"Upon the world in patterns passionate yet clear,"
781,CORNUCOPIA,And stains
782,CORNUCOPIA,"Each soul.  The mind, decoyed"
783,CORNUCOPIA,By thoughts that grind and tear
784,CORNUCOPIA,"Away old values,"
785,CORNUCOPIA,Is sent down other thoughts
786,CORNUCOPIA,"So subtly swift,"
787,CORNUCOPIA,That in their fleeting passage
788,CORNUCOPIA,They can cut adrift our souls
789,CORNUCOPIA,Upon a sea of wonder and of fear.
790,CORNUCOPIA,Within the arid minds of men
791,CORNUCOPIA,"This music sounds but once, for then"
792,CORNUCOPIA,They hear no other song.
793,CORNUCOPIA,"In it, tumultuous rush of wings,"
794,CORNUCOPIA,The glamour of old lovely things
795,CORNUCOPIA,"In deserts buried long,"
796,CORNUCOPIA,The grace of beasts that bound and leap
797,CORNUCOPIA,With movements blithe and strong
798,CORNUCOPIA,--Of those that creep
799,CORNUCOPIA,Away in hissing-reptile rage--
800,CORNUCOPIA,"All these, all these are found."
801,CORNUCOPIA,They hear
802,CORNUCOPIA,"The secrets, solved, of each dead age,"
803,CORNUCOPIA,Each mystery is clear.
804,CORNUCOPIA,"For in this music's flow, the din"
805,CORNUCOPIA,Of spheres that tear and speed and spin
806,CORNUCOPIA,"Through pulsing space is heard,"

841,SONG,The moon sails down once more; our mermaids bring
842,SONG,Rich gifts of ocean fruit.  Again we sing.
843,SONG,"Enchantment, love, vague fear, and memories"

845,SONG,With myriad love-enhancing mysteries

848,SONG,Our song floats on the opiate breeze.  Why seek
849,SONG,"To goad your carven galleys, fast-bound slaves"
850,SONG,"Who search each sweeping line of bay and creek,"
851,SONG,"Only to stagger on a hidden rock, or find"
852,SONG,The limp dead sails swept off by sudden wind?
853,SONG,"Thus always you must search the cruel sea,"
854,SONG,For if you find us mankind shall be free!
855,SONG,
856,SONG,"But when you sleep we grasp you by the hand,"
857,SONG,And to the trickling honey of the flute
858,SONG,We lead you to a distant shimmering land
859,SONG,"Where lotus-eaters munch their golden fruit,"
860,SONG,Then fall upon the fields of summer flowers
861,SONG,"In drunken sunlit slumber, while a fawn"
862,SONG,Prances and dances round them.
863,SONG,"Oh, those hours"
864,SONG,When through the crystal valleys of the dawn
865,SONG,Down from the haunted forests of the night
866,SONG,"There dash the dew-drenched centaurs on their way,"
867,SONG,Mad with the sudden rush of golden light
868,SONG,"--Affright the lotus-eaters, as they sway"
869,SONG,Towards the woodlands in a stumbling flight.
870,SONG,In these deep groves we follow through the cool
871,SONG,"Shadow of high columnar trees, to find"
872,SONG,The fallen sky within a forest pool
873,SONG,"That's faintly veiled and fretted by a wind,"
874,SONG,Lest our white flashing limbs should turn you blind.

882,SONG,

884,SONG,"We grope our way thro' vast tall palaces,"

923,PROSPECT ROAD,"Of dire and hidden, carefully hidden, thoughts--"
924,PROSPECT ROAD,"Cruel, wicked and unfathomable things"
925,PROSPECT ROAD,That lie behind this infamy of stone.
926,PROSPECT ROAD,"Then clamour, shrieking voices, or a pause"
927,PROSPECT ROAD,That falls like lead through the suspended air;
928,PROSPECT ROAD,Broken by laughter--rending piercing sounds
929,PROSPECT ROAD,That seem to tear the fabric of our minds.
930,PROSPECT ROAD,"Slinking along these wicked, stricken walls,"
931,PROSPECT ROAD,I reached a shining distant point of light.
932,PROSPECT ROAD,"And glory came--vast and unending light,"
933,PROSPECT ROAD,"Rays--flashing, writhing rays of light."
934,PROSPECT ROAD,"And then the music sounded.  Ah, that sound!"
935,PROSPECT ROAD,
936,PROSPECT ROAD,Cadences rose and fell unendingly--
937,PROSPECT ROAD,"Quivering, shining waves of sound and sight--"
938,PROSPECT ROAD,Sounds of the universe--the cries of space
939,PROSPECT ROAD,And planets tumbling wildly round our world
940,PROSPECT ROAD,--Showing the meaning of the meaningless.
941,PROSPECT ROAD,"""God and eternity""--strange flashing sounds"
942,PROSPECT ROAD,"The whirl of time, ""Melchisedec""--""Glory of God"""
943,PROSPECT ROAD,And space--the universe--like framing words--

967,WAR-HORSES,Surely they are more spirited

969,WAR-HORSES,Their enamelled wings

971,WAR-HORSES,--Their eyelids
972,WAR-HORSES,Sag a little

975,WAR-HORSES,
976,WAR-HORSES,"Oh, these war-horses!"
977,WAR-HORSES,They have seen it through.
978,WAR-HORSES,Theirs has been a splendid part!

980,WAR-HORSES,For the Queens of Sheba

982,WAR-HORSES,But for four years
983,WAR-HORSES,Platitudes have remained
984,WAR-HORSES,"Uncoined,"

988,WAR-HORSES,A day.
989,WAR-HORSES,

992,WAR-HORSES,They have preened

994,WAR-HORSES,After their blood-bath.
995,WAR-HORSES,"Old men seem a little younger,"

2047,CLOWN PONDI,My burning sense for laughter and my joy
2048,CLOWN PONDI,"In crowds, in tumult, and in blazing lights,"

2276,BLACK MASS,"And sigh and talk, as if themselves alive."
2277,BLACK MASS,"Small shadows cringe about the room incredibly,"
2278,BLACK MASS,Grotesque and dwarf-like in their attitudes;

2280,BLACK MASS,Triumphant heralds of an evil reign.
2281,BLACK MASS,
2282,BLACK MASS,Secret and swift they flit about the wall;
2283,BLACK MASS,"Noiseless, they drag their feet about the floor,"

2291,BLACK MASS,Becomes a thing of substance--fills the room
2292,BLACK MASS,And clings like ivy to the listening walls.
2293,BLACK MASS,The flickering light flares up--then gutters out.
2294,BLACK MASS,The shadows seem to shiver and expand
2295,BLACK MASS,"To active, evil things that breathe and live."

2300,BLACK MASS,--Rhythm of wicked music that escapes
2301,BLACK MASS,"Our consciousness, tho' we have known it long--"
2302,BLACK MASS,The music of the evil things of Night
2303,BLACK MASS,"Scarcely remembered from some dim, vast world--"
2304,BLACK MASS,The things that haunted us when we were young
2305,BLACK MASS,And nearer to our past realities.
2306,BLACK MASS,"Like scaly snakes, the hymn to evil writhes"
2307,BLACK MASS,Through the sub-conscious basis of our mind.
2308,BLACK MASS,"Eddies of icy breath, or hot as flame,"
2309,BLACK MASS,"Twist into all the corners of the room,"
2310,BLACK MASS,"Filling our veins with fire like red-hot iron,"
2311,BLACK MASS,And wicked as the Prince of Evil Things.
2312,BLACK MASS,
2313,BLACK MASS,Faintly his glowing presence is revealed to us
2314,BLACK MASS,Amid the chorus of his satellites.

2628,RHAPSODE,You who lack all imagination?
2629,RHAPSODE,"Why should we sing to you of your poor joys,"
2630,RHAPSODE,That you may see beauty through a poet's mind--
2631,RHAPSODE,Beauty where there was none before?
2632,RHAPSODE,"Why should we heed your miserable opinions,"
2633,RHAPSODE,And your paltry fears?
2634,RHAPSODE,Why listen to your tales and narratives--

2636,RHAPSODE,Amble amiably all the dull days

2638,RHAPSODE,We know you now--and what you wish to be told:
2639,RHAPSODE,"That the larks are singing in the trenches,"
2640,RHAPSODE,"That the fruit trees will again blossom in the spring,"

2645,RHAPSODE,We shall sing to you

2647,RHAPSODE,To death in the circus of Flanders;
2648,RHAPSODE,Of the skeletons that gather the fruit
2649,RHAPSODE,From the ruined orchards of France;

2671,RHAPSODE,"Beneath the folds of the sun's funeral pall,"
2672,RHAPSODE,"You will have to drink a little more champagne,"

2674,RHAPSODE,"What you need (as you rightly say, my dear sir) is CHEERING-UP."
2675,RHAPSODE,There you will see vastly funny sketches
2676,RHAPSODE,Of your fighting countrymen;
2677,RHAPSODE,And they will be represented
2678,RHAPSODE,As those of whom you may be proud.
2679,RHAPSODE,"For they cannot talk English properly,"
2680,RHAPSODE,Or express themselves but by swearing;
2681,RHAPSODE,Or perhaps they may be shown as drunk.
2682,RHAPSODE,"But they will all appear cheerful,"
2683,RHAPSODE,And you will be pleased;
2684,RHAPSODE,"And as you lurch amiably home, you will laugh,"
2685,RHAPSODE,And at each laugh
2686,RHAPSODE,Another countryman will be dead!

2702,RHAPSODE,"With an oath on his lips,"
2703,RHAPSODE,Or the refrain from a comic song--
2704,RHAPSODE,Or a cheerful comment of some kind.
2705,RHAPSODE,It was very unpleasant for all of us--
2706,RHAPSODE,But we had to see it through.

2763,THE TRAP,The world is young and green.
2764,THE TRAP,Its woods are golden beneath the May-time sun;
2765,THE TRAP,But within its trap of steel the rabbit plunges
2766,THE TRAP,Madly to and fro.

2772,THE TRAP,

2775,THE TRAP,The rabbit's eye glints at him--
2776,THE TRAP,Gleaming from the impenetrable obscurity of its prison.
2777,THE TRAP,He stoops and lifts the catch
2778,THE TRAP,"(He cannot hold it long, for the spring is heavy)."
2779,THE TRAP,"The rabbit could now be free,"
2780,THE TRAP,But it does not move;
2781,THE TRAP,For from the darkness of its death-hutch
2782,THE TRAP,The world looks like another brightly baited trap.
2783,THE TRAP,"So, remaining within its steel prison,"
2784,THE TRAP,It argues thus:
2785,THE TRAP,"""Perhaps I may bleed to death,"
2786,THE TRAP,"But it will probably take a long time,"
2787,THE TRAP,"And, at any rate,"
2788,THE TRAP,I am secure

2790,THE TRAP,"Besides, if I did come out now"
2791,THE TRAP,All the people who thought I was a lion
2792,THE TRAP,"Would see, by the trap-mark on my leg,"
2793,THE TRAP,"That I am only an unfortunate rabbit,"
2794,THE TRAP,And this might promote disloyalty among the children.
2795,THE TRAP,When the clamp closed on my leg
2796,THE TRAP,It was a ruse
2797,THE TRAP,To kill me.
2798,THE TRAP,Probably the lifting of it betrays the same purpose!
2799,THE TRAP,If I come out now
2800,THE TRAP,They will think they can trap rabbits
2801,THE TRAP,Whenever they like.

2810,THE TRAP,Trickles on to the grass
2811,THE TRAP,"Outside,"
2812,THE TRAP,And leaves a brown stain on its brightness.

2993,ARMCHAIR,How to look after babies and to cook;
2994,ARMCHAIR,Teach them to save their money and invest;
2995,ARMCHAIR,Not to bring children up in luxury
2996,ARMCHAIR,--But do without a nursemaid in the house!
2997,ARMCHAIR,
2998,ARMCHAIR,"If I were old, or only seventy,"
2999,ARMCHAIR,Then should I be a great man in his prime.
3000,ARMCHAIR,I should rule army corps; at my command
3001,ARMCHAIR,"Men would rise up, salute me, and attack"
3002,ARMCHAIR,--And die.  Or I might also govern men
3003,ARMCHAIR,"By making speeches with my toothless jaws,"
3004,ARMCHAIR,"Chattering constantly; and men should say,"
3005,ARMCHAIR,"""One grand old man is still worth half his pay!"""
3006,ARMCHAIR,That day I'd send my grandsons out to France
3007,ARMCHAIR,--And wish I'd got ten other ones to send
3008,ARMCHAIR,"(One cannot sacrifice too much, I'd say)."
3009,ARMCHAIR,"Then would I make a noble toothless speech,"
3010,ARMCHAIR,And all the listening Parliament would cheer.
3011,ARMCHAIR,"""Gentlemen, we will never end this war"
3012,ARMCHAIR,Till all the younger men with martial mien
3013,ARMCHAIR,Have entered capitals; never make peace
3014,ARMCHAIR,"Till they are cripples, on one leg, or dead!"""
3015,ARMCHAIR,"Then would the Bishops all go mad with joy,"
3016,ARMCHAIR,"Cantuar, Ebor, and the other ones,"
3017,ARMCHAIR,Be overwhelmed with pious ecstasy.
3018,ARMCHAIR,In thanking Him we'd got a Christian--
3019,ARMCHAIR,"An Englishman--still worth his salt--to talk,"
3020,ARMCHAIR,In every pulpit they would preach and prance;
3021,ARMCHAIR,"And our great Church would work, as heretofore,"
3022,ARMCHAIR,To bring this poor old nation to its knees.
3023,ARMCHAIR,"Then we'd forbid all liberty, and make"
3024,ARMCHAIR,Free speech a relic of our impious past;
3025,ARMCHAIR,"And when this war is finished, when the world"
3026,ARMCHAIR,"Is torn and bleeding, cut and bruised to death,"
3027,ARMCHAIR,Then I'd pronounce my peace terms--to the poor!
3028,ARMCHAIR,"But as it is, I am not ninety yet,"
3029,ARMCHAIR,And so must pay my reverence to these men--
3030,ARMCHAIR,"These grand old men, who still can see and talk,"
3031,ARMCHAIR,Who sacrifice each other's sons each day.
3032,ARMCHAIR,"O Lord! let me be ninety yet, I pray."
3033,ARMCHAIR,Methuselah was quite a youngster when
3034,ARMCHAIR,"He died.  Now, vainly weeping, we should say:"
3035,ARMCHAIR,"""Another great man perished in his prime!"""

3097,THE NEXT WAR,
3098,THE NEXT WAR,The long war had ended.
3099,THE NEXT WAR,Its miseries had grown faded.
3100,THE NEXT WAR,Deaf men became difficult to talk to.
3101,THE NEXT WAR,Heroes became bores.
3102,THE NEXT WAR,
3103,THE NEXT WAR,Those alchemists
3104,THE NEXT WAR,"Who had converted blood into gold,"

3108,THE NEXT WAR,"""We think perhaps we ought"
