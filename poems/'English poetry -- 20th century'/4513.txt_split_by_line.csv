147,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.
148,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,
149,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"NOW that I've nearly done my days,"
150,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"And grown too stiff to sweep or sew,"
151,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"I sit and think, till I'm amaze,"
152,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,About what lots of things I know:
153,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,Things as I've found out one by one--
154,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"And when I'm fast down in the clay,"
155,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,My knowing things and how they're done
156,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,Will all be lost and thrown away.
157,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,
158,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"There's things, I know, as won't be lost,"
159,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,Things as folks write and talk about:
160,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"The way to keep your roots from frost,"
161,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,And how to get your ink spots out.
162,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"What medicine's good for sores and sprains,"
163,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"What way to salt your butter down,"
164,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"What charms will cure your different pains,"
165,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,And what will bright your faded gown.
166,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,
167,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"But more important things than these,"
168,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,They can't be written in a book:
169,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"How fast to boil your greens and peas,"
170,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,And how good bacon ought to look;
171,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"The feel of real good wearing stuff,"
172,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"The kind of apple as will keep,"
173,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"The look of bread that's rose enough,"
174,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,And how to get a child asleep.
175,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,
176,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"Whether the jam is fit to pot,"
177,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"Whether the milk is going to turn,"
178,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"Whether a hen will lay or not,"
179,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,Is things as some folks never learn.
180,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"I know the weather by the sky,"
181,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,I know what herbs grow in what lane;
182,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"And if sick men are going to die,"
183,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,Or if they'll get about again.
184,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,
185,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"Young wives come in, a-smiling, grave,"
186,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,With secrets that they itch to tell:
187,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"I know what sort of times they'll have,"
188,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,And if they'll have a boy or gell.
189,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"And if a lad is ill to bind,"
190,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"Or some young maid is hard to lead,"
191,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"I know when you should speak 'em kind,"
192,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,And when it's scolding as they need.
193,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,
194,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"I used to know where birds ud set,"
195,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"And likely spots for trout or hare,"
196,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,And God may want me to forget
197,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,The way to set a line or snare;
198,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"But not the way to truss a chick,"
199,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"To fry a fish, or baste a roast,"
200,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"Nor how to tell, when folks are sick,"
201,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,What kind of herb will ease them most!
202,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,
203,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,Forgetting seems such silly waste!
204,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"I know so many little things,"
205,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,And now the Angels will make haste
206,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,To dust it all away with wings!
207,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"O God, you made me like to know,"
208,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"You kept the things straight in my head,"
209,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,"Please God, if you can make it so,"
210,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,Let me know something when I'm dead.
211,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,
212,THE THINGS THAT MATTER.,
213,THE CONFESSION.,THE CONFESSION.
214,THE CONFESSION.,
215,THE CONFESSION.,I HAVEN'T always acted good:
216,THE CONFESSION.,I've taken things not meant for me;
217,THE CONFESSION.,"Not other people's drink and food,"
218,THE CONFESSION.,But things they never seemed to see.
219,THE CONFESSION.,I haven't done the way I ought
220,THE CONFESSION.,"If all they say in church is true,"
221,THE CONFESSION.,"But all I've had I've fairly bought,"
222,THE CONFESSION.,And paid for pretty heavy too.
223,THE CONFESSION.,
224,THE CONFESSION.,For days and weeks are very long
225,THE CONFESSION.,"If you get nothing new and bright,"
226,THE CONFESSION.,And if you never do no wrong
227,THE CONFESSION.,Somehow you never do no right.
228,THE CONFESSION.,The chap that daresent go a yard
229,THE CONFESSION.,For fear the path should lead astray
230,THE CONFESSION.,"May be a saint--though that seems hard,"
231,THE CONFESSION.,"But he's no traveller, any way."
232,THE CONFESSION.,
233,THE CONFESSION.,"Some things I can't be sorry for,"
234,THE CONFESSION.,The things that silly people hate:
235,THE CONFESSION.,"But some I did I do deplore,"
236,THE CONFESSION.,"I knew, inside, they wasn't straight."
237,THE CONFESSION.,"And when my last account is filed,"
238,THE CONFESSION.,"And stuck-up angels stop their song,"
239,THE CONFESSION.,I'll ask God's pardon like a child
240,THE CONFESSION.,For what I really knew was wrong.
241,THE CONFESSION.,
242,THE CONFESSION.,"If you've a child, you'd rather see"
243,THE CONFESSION.,"A bit of temper, off and on,"
244,THE CONFESSION.,"A greedy grab, a silly spree--"
245,THE CONFESSION.,And then a brave thing said or done
246,THE CONFESSION.,Than hear your boy whine all day long
247,THE CONFESSION.,About the things he musn't do:
248,THE CONFESSION.,"Just doing nothing, right or wrong:"
249,THE CONFESSION.,And God may feel the same as you.
250,THE CONFESSION.,
251,THE CONFESSION.,"For God's our Father, so they say,"
252,THE CONFESSION.,He made His laws and He made me;
253,THE CONFESSION.,He'll understand about the way
254,THE CONFESSION.,Me and His laws could not agree.
255,THE CONFESSION.,"He might say, ""You're worth more, My son,"
256,THE CONFESSION.,Than all My laws since law began.
257,THE CONFESSION.,Take good with bad--here's something done--
258,THE CONFESSION.,"And I'm your God, and you're My man."""
259,THE CONFESSION.,
260,THE CONFESSION.,
261,WORK.,WORK.
262,WORK.,
263,WORK.,"WHEN I am busying about,"
264,WORK.,"Sewing on buttons, tapes, and strings,"
265,WORK.,Hanging the week's wet washing out
266,WORK.,"Or ironing the children's things,"
267,WORK.,"Sweeping and dusting, cleaning grates,"
268,WORK.,"Scrubbing the dresser or the floors,"
269,WORK.,"Washing the greasy dinner plates,"
270,WORK.,Scouring the brasses on the doors--
271,WORK.,
272,WORK.,"I wonder what it's all about,"
273,WORK.,And when did people first begin
274,WORK.,To keep the dirt and wornness out
275,WORK.,And keep the wholesome comfort in:
276,WORK.,How long it is since women bore
277,WORK.,"This round of wash and make and mend,"
278,WORK.,And what God makes us do it for
279,WORK.,And whether it will ever end!
280,WORK.,
281,WORK.,When God began to do His work
282,WORK.,He made a new thing every day--
283,WORK.,"Even now He is not one to shirk,"
284,WORK.,"But makes things, always some new way"
285,WORK.,"He made the earth, and sky, and sun,"
286,WORK.,"The creatures of the sea and wood,"
287,WORK.,And when his first week's work was done
288,WORK.,He saw that it was very good.
289,WORK.,
290,WORK.,But He--for all He worked so fast
291,WORK.,"To finish air, and wave, and shore,"
292,WORK.,Knew that this work of His would last
293,WORK.,For ever and for evermore.
294,WORK.,"On Saturday night He was content,"
295,WORK.,He knew that Monday would not bring
296,WORK.,"Need for another firmament,"
297,WORK.,Another set of everything.
298,WORK.,
299,WORK.,But though my work is easier far
300,WORK.,"Than making sky and sea and sun,"
301,WORK.,"It's harder than God's labours are,"
302,WORK.,Because my work is never done.
303,WORK.,"I sweep and churn, save and contrive,"
304,WORK.,"I bake and brew, I don't complain,"
305,WORK.,But every Monday morning I've
306,WORK.,Last Monday's work to do again.
307,WORK.,
308,WORK.,I'm good at work--I work away;
309,WORK.,Always the same my work must go;
310,WORK.,"The flowers grow different every day,"
311,WORK.,That's why I like to see them grow.
312,WORK.,"If, up in Heaven, God understood"
313,WORK.,He'd let me for my Paradise
314,WORK.,Make all things new and very good
315,WORK.,And never make the same thing twice!
316,WORK.,
317,WORK.,
318,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.
319,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,
320,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,"You needn't pray for me, old lady, I don't want no one's prayer,"
321,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,I'm fit and jolly as ever I was--you needn't think I care.
322,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,"When I go whistling down the road, when the warm night is falling,"
323,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,"She needn't think I'm whistling her, it's another girl I'm calling."
324,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,
325,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,"If I pass her house a dozen times, or fifty times a day,"
326,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,"She needn't think I think of her, my work lies out that way."
327,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,If they should tell her I've grown thin (for that is what they've told me)
328,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,"This cursed weather counts for that, and not the girl who sold me."
329,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,
330,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,And if they say I'm off my feed I still can tip a can;
331,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,If I get drunk what's that to her? I am not her young man.
332,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,"I know I've had a lucky let-off--she ain't no class, she ain't,"
333,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,For all she looked like a bush o' roses and talked like a story book saint.
334,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,
335,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,"I never give a thought to her. Don't worry your old head,"
336,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,"I've quite forgot her pretty ways and the cruel things she said,"
337,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,"There's lots of other gals to be had as any chap can see,"
338,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,"So you cheer up, you've got no call to go and pray for me."
339,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,"But all the same, if you want to pray, you'd best pray God take care of them,"
340,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,"For if I catch them two together, by hell! I'll swing for the pair of them."
341,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,
342,THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER.,
343,THE WILL TO LIVE.,THE WILL TO LIVE.
344,THE WILL TO LIVE.,
345,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"SINCE Faith is a veil that has nothing behind it,"
346,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"And Hope wanders lost where no mortal can find it,"
347,THE WILL TO LIVE.,Since Love is a mirror we break in a minute
348,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"In snatching the image our soul has cast in it,"
349,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"What is the use of the Summers and Springs,"
350,THE WILL TO LIVE.,The wave of the woods and the waft of the wings--
351,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Since all means nothing, and good things and ill"
352,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Make madness,--a mirage tormenting us still?"
353,THE WILL TO LIVE.,
354,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Since all the fighting, the ardent endeavour,"
355,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"The heart cast bleeding to feed the Ideal,"
356,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Are vain, vain, vain, and the one thing real"
357,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Is that all's vain, for ever and ever;"
358,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Why then, be a man and stand back from the strife,"
359,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Fall by the sword, but keep out of the snare;"
360,THE WILL TO LIVE.,Will but to be--and be willing to bear
361,THE WILL TO LIVE.,All that the gods may lay on your of life!
362,THE WILL TO LIVE.,
363,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"In the far East, where light ever dawns first,"
364,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"There has man learned how the Fates may be cheated,"
365,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"How by our craft may their strength be defeated,"
366,THE WILL TO LIVE.,Though all our best be no match for their worst!
367,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Kill the desire that they set in your bosom,"
368,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Long not for fruit when you gaze on the blossom,"
369,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Dream not of flowers when you gaze on the bud,"
370,THE WILL TO LIVE.,Kill all the rebels that shout in your blood.
371,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Sorrow and sickness, disease and decay--"
372,THE WILL TO LIVE.,These toll the hours of Life's desolate day;
373,THE WILL TO LIVE.,Hopes unfulfilled and forbidden delight
374,THE WILL TO LIVE.,These are the dreams of Life's treacherous night.
375,THE WILL TO LIVE.,So let me image an infinite peace
376,THE WILL TO LIVE.,Touched with no joy but the ease of release.
377,THE WILL TO LIVE.,Out of the eddies I climb and I cease
378,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Keeping, in change for this man's soul of me,"
379,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Something which, by the eternal decree,"
380,THE WILL TO LIVE.,Is as like Nothing as Something can be!
381,THE WILL TO LIVE.,
382,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Not to desire, to admit, to adore,"
383,THE WILL TO LIVE.,Casting the robe of the soul that you wore
384,THE WILL TO LIVE.,Just as the soul casts the body's robe down.
385,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"This is man's destiny, this is man's crown."
386,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"This is the splendour, the end of the feast;"
387,THE WILL TO LIVE.,This is the light of the Star in the East.
388,THE WILL TO LIVE.,
389,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"So, Silence reconciles Life's jarring phrases"
390,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Far in the future, austere and august:"
391,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Meanwhile, the buds of the poplars are falling,"
392,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Spring's on the lawn, and a little voice calling:"
393,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"""Daddy, come out! Daddy darling, you must!"
394,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Daddy come out and help Molly pick daisies!"""
395,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"And, since one's here, and the Spring's in the garden"
396,THE WILL TO LIVE.,(How many lives hence will that thought earn pardon?)
397,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Since one's a man and man's heart is insistent,"
398,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"And, since Nirvana is doubtful and distant,"
399,THE WILL TO LIVE.,Though life's a hard road and thorny to travel--
400,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Stones in the borders and grass on the gravel,"
401,THE WILL TO LIVE.,"Still there's the wisdom that wise men call folly,"
402,THE WILL TO LIVE.,Still one can go and pick daisies with Molly!
403,THE WILL TO LIVE.,

406,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,
407,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,OH God! if I do my duty
408,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,"And walk in the thorny way,"
409,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,"Will you pay me with heavens of beauty,"
410,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,Millions of lives away?
411,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,"Will you give me the music of heaven,"
412,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,"And the joy that none understands,"
413,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,In place of what life would have given
414,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,If I had held out my hands?
415,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,
416,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,"I have lived in a narrow prison,"
417,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,"I have writhed 'neath a bitter creed,"
418,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,And I dare to say that no heaven can pay
419,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,"The renounced dream and deed,"
420,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,"But when my life's portal closes,"
421,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,If you have no heaven to spare
422,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,"God! give me a garden of roses,"
423,THE BEATIFIC VISION.,And some one to walk with there.

431,MUMMY WHEAT.,MUMMY WHEAT.
432,MUMMY WHEAT.,
433,MUMMY WHEAT.,"LAID close to Death, these many thousand years,"
434,MUMMY WHEAT.,In this small seed Life hid herself and smiled;
435,MUMMY WHEAT.,"So well she hid, Death was at least beguiled,"
436,MUMMY WHEAT.,Set free the grain--and lo! the sevenfold ears!
437,MUMMY WHEAT.,
438,MUMMY WHEAT.,"Warmed by the sun, wooed by the wind's soft word,"
439,MUMMY WHEAT.,Under blue canopy they hold their state:
440,MUMMY WHEAT.,"For this, ah, was it not worth while to wait"
441,MUMMY WHEAT.,Through all the centuries of hope deferred?
442,MUMMY WHEAT.,
443,MUMMY WHEAT.,What could they know who laid the seed with Death
444,MUMMY WHEAT.,Of this Divine fruition fixed and planned?
445,MUMMY WHEAT.,Love--since Life parts us--lend my hand your hand
446,MUMMY WHEAT.,And look with me into the eyes of faith.
447,MUMMY WHEAT.,
448,MUMMY WHEAT.,For here between your hand and mine there lies
449,MUMMY WHEAT.,A little seed we trust to Death to keep
450,MUMMY WHEAT.,Through unimagined centuries of sleep
451,MUMMY WHEAT.,Until the day when Life shall bid it rise.
452,MUMMY WHEAT.,
453,MUMMY WHEAT.,"Our harvest waits us. Who knows where or how,"
454,MUMMY WHEAT.,"What worlds away, wrapped in what coil of pain?"
455,MUMMY WHEAT.,But Life shall bid us pluck gold sevenfold grain
456,MUMMY WHEAT.,Grown from the love she bids us bury now.

2297,THE THREE KINGS.,And the next gold day waned trembling and white

2591,DEATH.,Close in her arm

2617,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"_Who Died on October 25th_, 1899."
2618,SARETTA DEAKIN.,
2619,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"THERE was a day,"
2620,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"A horrible Autumn day,"
2621,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"When from her home, the home she made for ours"
2622,SARETTA DEAKIN.,And that day made a nightmare of white flowers
2623,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"And folk in black who whispered pityingly,"
2624,SARETTA DEAKIN.,They carried her away;
2625,SARETTA DEAKIN.,And left our hearts all cold
2626,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"And empty, yet with such a store to hold"
2627,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Of sodden grief the slow drops still ooze out,"
2628,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"And, falling on all fair things, they wither these."
2629,SARETTA DEAKIN.,Tears came with time--but not with time went by.
2630,SARETTA DEAKIN.,
2631,SARETTA DEAKIN.,And still we wander desolate about
2632,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"The poor changed house, the garden and the croft,"
2633,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Warm kitchen, sunny parlour, with the soft"
2634,SARETTA DEAKIN.,Intolerable pervading memories
2635,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Of her whose face and voice made melodies,"
2636,SARETTA DEAKIN.,Sweet unforgotten songs of mother-love--
2637,SARETTA DEAKIN.,Dear songs of all the little joys that were.
2638,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"We see the sun, and have no joy thereof,"
2639,SARETTA DEAKIN.,Because she gathered in her dying hands
2640,SARETTA DEAKIN.,And carried with her to the fair far lands
2641,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"The flower of all our joy, because she went"
2642,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Out of the garden where her days were spent,"
2643,SARETTA DEAKIN.,And took the very sun away with her.
2644,SARETTA DEAKIN.,
2645,SARETTA DEAKIN.,The cross stands at her head.
2646,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Over her breast, that loving mother-breast,"
2647,SARETTA DEAKIN.,Close buds of pansies purple and white are pressed.
2648,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"It seems a place for rest,"
2649,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"For happy folded sleep; but ah, not there,"
2650,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Not there, not there, our hardest tears are shed,"
2651,SARETTA DEAKIN.,But in the house made empty for her sake.
2652,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Here, in the night intolerable, wake"
2653,SARETTA DEAKIN.,The hungry passionate pains of Love still strong
2654,SARETTA DEAKIN.,To fight with death the bitter slow night long.
2655,SARETTA DEAKIN.,Then the rich price that poor Love has to pay
2656,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Is paid, slow drop by drop, till the new day"
2657,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"With thin cold fingers pushes back night's wings,"
2658,SARETTA DEAKIN.,And drags us out to common cruel things
2659,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"That sting, and barb their stings with memory."
2660,SARETTA DEAKIN.,O Love--and is the price too hard to give?
2661,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Thine is the splendour of all things that live,"
2662,SARETTA DEAKIN.,And this thy pain the price of life to thee--
2663,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"The sacrament that binds to the beloved,"
2664,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"The chain that holds though mountains be removed,"
2665,SARETTA DEAKIN.,The portent of thine immortality.
2666,SARETTA DEAKIN.,
2667,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"So, in the house of pain imprisoned, we"
2668,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Endure our bondage, and work out our time,"
2669,SARETTA DEAKIN.,Nor seek from out our dungeon walls to climb--
2670,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Bondsmen, who would not, if we could, be free."
2671,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Thank God, our hands still hold Love's cord--and she--"
2672,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Do not her hands still clasp the cord we hold,"
2673,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Drawing us near, coiling bright fold on fold,"
2674,SARETTA DEAKIN.,Till the far day when it shall draw us near
2675,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"To the sight of her--her living hands, her dear"
2676,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Tired face, grown weary of watching for our face?"
2677,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"And we shall hold her, in the happy place,"
2678,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"And hear her voice, the old same voice we knew--"
2679,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"""Ah! children, I am tired of wanting you!"""
2680,SARETTA DEAKIN.,
2681,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Or, in some world more beautiful and dear"
2682,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Than any she ever even dreamed of here,"
2683,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Where time is changed, does she await the day"
2684,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"She longed for, and so little a while away,"
2685,SARETTA DEAKIN.,When all the love we watered with our tears
2686,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Shall bloom, transplanted by the kindly years?"
2687,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Dreaming through her new garden does she go,"
2688,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Remembering the old garden, long ago,"
2689,SARETTA DEAKIN.,Tending new flowers more fair than those that grow
2690,SARETTA DEAKIN.,In this sad garden where such sad flowers blow;
2691,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"And, fondly touching bud and leaf and shoot,"
2692,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Training her flowers to perfect branch and root,"
2693,SARETTA DEAKIN.,Does she sometimes entreat some darling flower
2694,SARETTA DEAKIN.,To wait a little for its opening hour?
2695,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Can you not hear her voice: ""Ah, not to-day,"
2696,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"While my dear flowers, my own, are far away."
2697,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Be patient, bud! to-morrow soon will come:"
2698,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Ah! blossom when my little girl comes home!"""
2699,SARETTA DEAKIN.,
2700,SARETTA DEAKIN.,But now. But here.
2701,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"The empty house, the always empty place--"
2702,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"The black remembrance that no night blots out,"
2703,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"The memories, white, unbearable, and dear"
2704,SARETTA DEAKIN.,That no white sunlight makes less cruel and clear?
2705,SARETTA DEAKIN.,The resistless riotous rout
2706,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Of cruel conquering thoughts, the night, the day?"
2707,SARETTA DEAKIN.,Love is immortal: this the price to pay.
2708,SARETTA DEAKIN.,Worse than all pain it would be to forget--
2709,SARETTA DEAKIN.,On Love's brave brow the crown of thorns is set.
2710,SARETTA DEAKIN.,Love is no niggard: though the price be high
2711,SARETTA DEAKIN.,Into God's market Love goes forth to buy
2712,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"With royal meed God's greatest gifts and gain,"
2713,SARETTA DEAKIN.,"Love offers up his whole rich store of pain,"
2714,SARETTA DEAKIN.,And buys of God Love's immortality.
