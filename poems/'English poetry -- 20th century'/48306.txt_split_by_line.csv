82,,*Day that I have Loved*
83,,
84,,"Tenderly, day that I have loved, I close your eyes,"
85,,"And smooth your quiet brow, and fold your thin dead hands."
86,,The grey veils of the half-light deepen; colour dies.
87,,"I bear you, a light burden, to the shrouded sands,"
88,,
89,,"Where lies your waiting boat, by wreaths of the sea’s making"
90,,"Mist-garlanded, with all grey weeds of the water crowned."
91,,"There you’ll be laid, past fear of sleep or hope of waking;"
92,,"And over the unmoving sea, without a sound,"
93,,
94,,"Faint hands will row you outward, out beyond our sight,"
95,,Us with stretched arms and empty eyes on the far-gleaming
96,,And marble sand....
97,,"Beyond the shifting cold twilight,"
98,,"Further than laughter goes, or tears, further than dreaming,"
99,,
100,,"There’ll be no port, no dawn-lit islands!  But the drear"
101,,"Waste darkening, and, at length, flame ultimate on the deep."
102,,"Oh, the last fire—and you, unkissed, unfriended there!"
103,,"Oh, the lone way’s red ending, and we not there to weep!"
104,,
105,,"(We found you pale and quiet, and strangely crowned with"
106,,"flowers,"
107,,"Lovely and secret as a child.  You came with us,"
108,,"Came happily, hand in hand with the young dancing hours,"
109,,"High on the downs at dawn!)  Void now and tenebrous,"
110,,
111,,The grey sands curve before me....
112,,"From the inland meadows,"
113,,"Fragrant of June and clover, floats the dark and fills"
114,,"The hollow sea’s dead face with little creeping shadows,"
115,,And the white silence brims the hollow of the hills.
116,,
117,,"Close in the nest is folded every weary wing,"
118,,"Hushed all the joyful voices, and we, who held you dear,"
119,,"Eastward we turn and homeward, alone, remembering..."
120,,"Day that I loved, day that I loved, the Night is here!"

389,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"And it’s but spoken words we hear,"
390,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,Where trumpets sang; when the mere skies
391,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,Are stranger and nobler than your eyes;
392,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"And flesh is flesh, was flame before;"
393,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,And infinite hungers leap no more
394,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,In the chance swaying of your dress;

401,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,
402,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,Safe in the magic of my woods
403,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"I lay, and watched the dying light."
404,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"Faint in the pale high solitudes,"
405,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"And washed with rain and veiled by night,"
406,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,
407,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,Silver and blue and green were showing.
408,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,And the dark woods grew darker still;
409,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,And birds were hushed; and peace was growing;
410,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,And quietness crept up the hill;
411,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,
412,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,And no wind was blowing ...
413,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,
414,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,And I knew
415,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"That this was the hour of knowing,"
416,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,And the night and the woods and you
417,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"Were one together, and I should find"
418,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,Soon in the silence the hidden key
419,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,Of all that had hurt and puzzled me—
420,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"Why you were you, and the night was kind,"
421,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,And the woods were part of the heart of me.
422,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,
423,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"And there I waited breathlessly,"
424,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"Alone; and slowly the holy three,"
425,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"The three that I loved, together grew"
426,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"One, in the hour of knowing,"
427,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"Night, and the woods, and you——"
428,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,
429,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,And suddenly
430,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"There was an uproar in my woods,"
431,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"The noise of a fool in mock distress,"
432,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"Crashing and laughing and blindly going,"
433,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"Of ignorant feet and a swishing dress,"
434,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,And a Voice profaning the solitudes.
435,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,
436,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"The spell was broken, the key denied me."
437,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,And at length your flat clear voice beside me
438,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,Mouthed cheerful clear flat platitudes.
439,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,
440,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,You came and quacked beside me in the wood.
441,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"You said, ""The view from here is very good!"""
442,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,"You said, ""It’s nice to be alone a bit!"""

454,SONG OF A TRIBE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS,
455,*I*,*I*
456,*I*,
457,*I*,Hot through Troy’s ruin Menelaus broke
458,*I*,"To Priam’s palace, sword in hand, to sate"
459,*I*,On that adulterous whore a ten years’ hate
460,*I*,"And a king’s honour.  Through red death, and smoke,"
461,*I*,"And cries, and then by quieter ways he strode,"
462,*I*,Till the still innermost chamber fronted him.
463,*I*,"He swung his sword, and crashed into the dim"
464,*I*,"Luxurious bower, flaming like a god."
465,*I*,
466,*I*,"High sat white Helen, lonely and serene."
467,*I*,"He had not remembered that she was so fair,"
468,*I*,And that her neck curved down in such a way;
469,*I*,"And he felt tired.  He flung the sword away,"
470,*I*,"And kissed her feet, and knelt before her there,"
471,*I*,The perfect Knight before the perfect Queen.
472,*I*,
473,*I*,
474,*II*,*II*
475,*II*,
476,*II*,So far the poet.  How should he behold
477,*II*,"That journey home, the long connubial years?"
478,*II*,He does not tell you how white Helen bears
479,*II*,"Child on legitimate child, becomes a scold,"
480,*II*,Haggard with virtue.  Menelaus bold
481,*II*,"Waxed garrulous, and sacked a hundred Troys"
482,*II*,’Twixt noon and supper.  And her golden voice
483,*II*,Got shrill as he grew deafer.  And both were old.
484,*II*,
485,*II*,Often he wonders why on earth he went
486,*II*,"Troyward, or why poor Paris ever came."
487,*II*,"Oft she weeps, gummy-eyed and impotent;"
488,*II*,Her dry shanks twitch at Paris’ mumbled name.
489,*II*,So Menelaus nagged; and Helen cried;
490,*II*,And Paris slept on by Scamander side.

495,*II*,*The Jolly Company*
496,*II*,
497,*II*,"The stars, a jolly company,"
498,*II*,"I envied, straying late and lonely;"
499,*II*,And cried upon their revelry:
500,*II*,"""O white companionship!  You only"
501,*II*,"In love, in faith unbroken dwell,"
502,*II*,"Friends radiant and inseparable!"""
503,*II*,
504,*II*,Light-heart and glad they seemed to me
505,*II*,And merry comrades (even so
506,*II*,_God out of Heaven may laugh to see_
507,*II*,_The happy crowds; and never know_
508,*II*,_That in his lone obscure distress_
509,*II*,_Each walketh in a wilderness)_.
510,*II*,
511,*II*,"But I, remembering, pitied well"
512,*II*,"And loved them, who, with lonely light,"
513,*II*,"In empty infinite spaces dwell,"
514,*II*,"Disconsolate.  For, all the night,"
515,*II*,"I heard the thin gnat-voices cry,"
516,*II*,"Star to faint star, across the sky."

522,*II*,
523,*II*,How can we find? how can we rest? how can
524,*II*,"We, being gods, win joy, or peace, being man?"
525,*II*,"We, the gaunt zanies of a witless Fate,"
526,*II*,"Who love the unloving, and the lover hate,"
527,*II*,"Forget the moment ere the moment slips,"
528,*II*,"Kiss with blind lips that seek beyond the lips,"
529,*II*,"Who want, and know not what we want, and cry"
530,*II*,"With crooked mouths for Heaven, and throw it by."
531,*II*,Love’s for completeness!  No perfection grows
532,*II*,"’Twixt leg, and arm, elbow, and ear, and nose,"
533,*II*,"And joint, and socket; but unsatisfied"
534,*II*,"Sprawling desires, shapeless, perverse, denied."
535,*II*,"Finger with finger wreathes; we love, and gape,"
536,*II*,"Fantastic shape to mazed fantastic shape,"
537,*II*,"Straggling, irregular, perplexed, embossed,"
538,*II*,"Grotesquely twined, extravagantly lost"
539,*II*,By crescive paths and strange protuberant ways
540,*II*,From sanity and from wholeness and from grace.
541,*II*,"How can love triumph, how can solace be,"
542,*II*,"Where fever turns toward fever, knee toward knee?"
543,*II*,"Could we but fill to harmony, and dwell"
544,*II*,"Simple as our thought and as perfectible,"
545,*II*,Rise disentangled from humanity
546,*II*,"Strange whole and new into simplicity,"
547,*II*,"Grow to a radiant round love, and bear"
548,*II*,"Unfluctuant passion for some perfect sphere,"
549,*II*,"Love moon to moon unquestioning, and be"
550,*II*,"Like the star Lunisequa, steadfastly"
551,*II*,"Following the round clear orb of her delight,"
552,*II*,"Patiently ever, through the eternal night!"

556,*II*,
557,*II*,*Town and Country*
558,*II*,
559,*II*,"Here, where love’s stuff is body, arm and side"
560,*II*,Are stabbing-sweet ’gainst chair and lamp and wall.
561,*II*,In every touch more intimate meanings hide;
562,*II*,And flaming brains are the white heart of all
563,*II*,
564,*II*,"Here, million pulses to one centre beat:"
565,*II*,"Closed in by men’s vast friendliness, alone,"
566,*II*,"Two can be drunk with solitude, and meet"
567,*II*,On the sheer point where sense with knowing’s one.
568,*II*,
569,*II*,"Here the green-purple clanging royal night,"
570,*II*,"And the straight lines and silent walls of town,"
571,*II*,"And roar, and glare, and dust, and myriad white"
572,*II*,"Undying passers, pinnacle and crown"
573,*II*,
574,*II*,Intensest heavens between close-lying faces
575,*II*,By the lamp’s airless fierce ecstatic fire;
576,*II*,"And we’ve found love in little hidden places,"
577,*II*,"Under great shades, between the mist and mire."
578,*II*,
579,*II*,"Stay! though the woods are quiet, and you’ve heard"
580,*II*,Night creep along the hedges.  Never go
581,*II*,"Where tangled foliage shrouds the crying bird,"
582,*II*,"And the remote winds sigh, and waters flow!"
583,*II*,
584,*II*,"Lest—as our words fall dumb on windless noons,"
585,*II*,"Or hearts grow hushed and solitary, beneath"
586,*II*,"Unheeding stars and unfamiliar moons,"
587,*II*,"Or boughs bend over, close and quiet as death,—"
588,*II*,
589,*II*,"Unconscious and unpassionate and still,"
590,*II*,"Cloud-like we lean and stare as bright leaves stare,"
591,*II*,And gradually along the stranger hill
592,*II*,"Our unwalled loves thin out on vacuous air,"
593,*II*,
594,*II*,"And suddenly there’s no meaning in our kiss,"
595,*II*,"And your lit upward face grows, where we lie"
596,*II*,"Lonelier and dreadfuller than sunlight is,"
597,*II*,And dumb and mad and eyeless like the sky.

604,*II*,In a cool curving world he lies
605,*II*,And ripples with dark ecstasies.
606,*II*,The kind luxurious lapse and steal
607,*II*,Shapes all his universe to feel
608,*II*,And know and be; the clinging stream
609,*II*,"Closes his memory, glooms his dream,"
610,*II*,"Who lips the roots o’ the shore, and glides"
611,*II*,Superb on unreturning tides.
612,*II*,Those silent waters weave for him
613,*II*,"A fluctuant mutable world and dim,"
614,*II*,Where wavering masses bulge and gape
615,*II*,"Mysterious, and shape to shape"
616,*II*,"Dies momently through whorl and hollow,"
617,*II*,And form and line and solid follow
618,*II*,Solid and line and form to dream
619,*II*,Fantastic down the eternal stream;
620,*II*,"An obscure world, a shifting world,"
621,*II*,"Bulbous, or pulled to thin, or curled,"
622,*II*,"Or serpentine, or driving arrows,"
623,*II*,"Or serene slidings, or March narrows."
624,*II*,"There slipping wave and shore are one,"
625,*II*,"And weed and mud.  No ray of sun,"
626,*II*,But glow to glow fades down the deep
627,*II*,(As dream to unknown dream in sleep);
628,*II*,Shaken translucency illumes
629,*II*,The hyaline of drifting glooms;
630,*II*,The strange soft-handed depth subdues
631,*II*,"Drowned colour there, but black to hues,"
632,*II*,"As death to living, decomposes—"
633,*II*,"Red darkness of the heart of roses,"
634,*II*,"Blue brilliant from dead starless skies,"
635,*II*,"And gold that lies behind the eyes,"
636,*II*,The unknown unnameable sightless white
637,*II*,"That is the essential flame of night,"
638,*II*,"Lustreless purple, hooded green,"
639,*II*,The myriad hues that lie between
640,*II*,Darkness and darkness!...
641,*II*,
642,*II*,"And all’s one,"
643,*II*,"Gentle, embracing, quiet, dun,"
644,*II*,"The world he rests in, world he knows,"
645,*II*,Perpetual curving.  Only—grows
646,*II*,"An eddy in that ordered falling,"
647,*II*,"A knowledge from the gloom, a calling"
648,*II*,"Weed in the wave, gleam in the mud—"
649,*II*,The dark fire leaps along his blood;
650,*II*,"Dateless and deathless, blind and still,"
651,*II*,The intricate impulse works its will;
652,*II*,"His woven world drops back; and he,"
653,*II*,"Sans providence, sans memory,"
654,*II*,"Unconscious and directly driven,"
655,*II*,Fades to some dank sufficient heaven.
656,*II*,
657,*II*,"O world of lips, O world of laughter,"
658,*II*,"Where hope is fleet and thought flies after,"
659,*II*,"Of lights in the clear night, of cries"
660,*II*,That drift along the wave and rise
661,*II*,"Thin to the glittering stars above,"
662,*II*,"You know the hands, the eyes of love!"
663,*II*,"The strife of limbs, the sightless clinging,"
664,*II*,"The infinite distance, and the singing"
665,*II*,"Blown by the wind, a flame of sound,"
666,*II*,"The gleam, the flowers, and vast around"
667,*II*,"The horizon, and the heights above—"
668,*II*,"You know the sigh, the song of love!"
669,*II*,
670,*II*,"But there the night is close, and there"
671,*II*,Darkness is cold and strange and bare;
672,*II*,And the secret deeps are whisperless;
673,*II*,And rhythm is all deliciousness;
674,*II*,"And joy is in the throbbing tide,"
675,*II*,Whose intricate fingers beat and glide
676,*II*,In felt bewildering harmonies
677,*II*,Of trembling touch; and music is
678,*II*,The exquisite knocking of the blood.
679,*II*,"Space is no more, under the mud;"
680,*II*,His bliss is older than the sun.
681,*II*,Silent and straight the waters run.
682,*II*,"The lights, the cries, the willows dim,"

692,*II*,"Laughing and looking, one of all,"
693,*II*,I watched the quivering lamplight fall
694,*II*,On plate and flowers and pouring tea
695,*II*,And cup and cloth; and they and we
696,*II*,Flung all the dancing moments by
697,*II*,With jest and glitter.  Lip and eye
698,*II*,"Flashed on the glory, shone and cried,"
699,*II*,"Improvident, unmemoried;"
700,*II*,And fitfully and like a flame
701,*II*,The light of laughter went and came.
702,*II*,Proud in their careless transience moved
703,*II*,The changing faces that I loved.
704,*II*,
705,*II*,"Till suddenly, and otherwhence,"
706,*II*,I looked upon your innocence.
707,*II*,For lifted clear and still and strange
708,*II*,From the dark woven flow of change
709,*II*,Under a vast and starless sky
710,*II*,I saw the immortal moment lie.
711,*II*,"One instant I, an instant, knew"
712,*II*,As God knows all.  And it and you
713,*II*,"I, above Time, oh, blind! could see"
714,*II*,In witless immortality.
715,*II*,"I saw the marble cup; the tea,"
716,*II*,"Hung on the air, an amber stream;"
717,*II*,"I saw the fire’s unglittering gleam,"
718,*II*,"The painted flame, the frozen smoke."
719,*II*,No more the flooding lamplight broke
720,*II*,On flying eyes and lips and hair;
721,*II*,"But lay, but slept unbroken there,"
722,*II*,"On stiller flesh, and body breathless,"
723,*II*,"And lips and laughter stayed and deathless,"
724,*II*,And words on which no silence grew.
725,*II*,Light was more alive than you.
726,*II*,
727,*II*,"For suddenly, and otherwhence,"
728,*II*,I looked on your magnificence.
729,*II*,"I saw the stillness and the light,"
730,*II*,"And you, august, immortal, white,"
731,*II*,Holy and strange; and every glint
732,*II*,Posture and jest and thought and tint
733,*II*,"Freed from the mask of transiency,"
734,*II*,"Triumphant in eternity,"
735,*II*,"Immote, immortal."
736,*II*,
737,*II*,Dazed at length
738,*II*,"Human eyes grew, mortal strength"
739,*II*,Wearied; and Time began to creep.
740,*II*,Change closed about me like a sleep.
741,*II*,Light glinted on the eyes I loved.
742,*II*,The cup was filled.  The bodies moved.
743,*II*,The drifting petal came to ground.
744,*II*,The laughter chimed its perfect round.
745,*II*,The broken syllable was ended.
746,*II*,"And I, so certain and so friended,"
747,*II*,"How could I cloud, or how distress,"
748,*II*,The heaven of your unconsciousness?
749,*II*,"Or shake at Time’s sufficient spell,"
750,*II*,Stammering of lights unutterable?
751,*II*,"The eternal holiness of you,"
752,*II*,"The timeless end, you never knew,"
753,*II*,"The peace that lay, the light that shone."
754,*II*,You never knew that I had gone
755,*II*,"A million miles away, and stayed"
756,*II*,A million years.  The laughter played
757,*II*,Unbroken round me; and the jest
758,*II*,Flashed on.  And we that knew the best
759,*II*,Down wonderful hours grew happier yet.
760,*II*,"I sang at heart, and talked, and eat,"
761,*II*,"And lived from laugh to laugh, I too,"

826,*II*,"Long learnt on Hellespont, or Styx,"
827,*II*,Dan Chaucer hears his river still
828,*II*,Chatter beneath a phantom mill.
829,*II*,"Tennyson notes, with studious eye,"
830,*II*,How Cambridge waters hurry by....
831,*II*,"And in that garden, black and white,"
832,*II*,Creep whispers through the grass all night;
833,*II*,"And spectral dance, before the dawn,"
834,*II*,A hundred Vicars down the lawn;
835,*II*,"Curates, long dust, will come and go"
836,*II*,"On lissom, clerical, printless toe;"
837,*II*,And oft between the boughs is seen
838,*II*,The sly shade of a Rural Dean....
839,*II*,"Till, at a shiver in the skies,"
840,*II*,"Vanishing with Satanic cries,"

844,*II*,The falling house that never falls.

847,*II*,And get me to England once again!
848,*II*,"For England’s the one land, I know,"
849,*II*,Where men with Splendid Hearts may go;
850,*II*,"And Cambridgeshire, of all England,"
851,*II*,The shire for Men who Understand;
852,*II*,And of _that_ district I prefer
853,*II*,The lovely hamlet Grantchester.
854,*II*,"For Cambridge people rarely smile,"
855,*II*,"Being urban, squat, and packed with guile;"
856,*II*,And Royston men in the far South
857,*II*,Are black and fierce and strange of mouth;
858,*II*,"At Over they fling oaths at one,"
859,*II*,"And worse than oaths at Trumpington,"
860,*II*,"And Ditton girls are mean and dirty,"
861,*II*,"And there’s none in Harston under thirty,"
862,*II*,And folks in Shelford and those parts
863,*II*,"Have twisted lips and twisted hearts,"
864,*II*,"And Barton men make Cockney rhymes,"
865,*II*,"And Coton’s full of nameless crimes,"
866,*II*,And things are done you’d not believe
867,*II*,"At Madingley, on Christmas Eve."
868,*II*,"Strong men have run for miles and miles,"
869,*II*,When one from Cherry Hinton smiles;
870,*II*,"Strong men have blanched, and shot their wives"
871,*II*,Rather than send them to St. Ives;
872,*II*,"Strong men have cried like babes, bydam,"
873,*II*,To hear what happened at Babraham.
874,*II*,"But Grantchester! ah, Grantchester!"
875,*II*,"There’s peace and holy quiet there,"
876,*II*,"Great clouds along pacific skies,"
877,*II*,"And men and women with straight eyes,"
878,*II*,"Lithe children lovelier than a dream,"
879,*II*,"A bosky wood, a slumbrous stream,"
880,*II*,And little kindly winds that creep
881,*II*,"Round twilight corners, half asleep."
882,*II*,In Grantchester their skins are white;
883,*II*,"They bathe by day, they bathe by night;"
884,*II*,The women there do all they ought;
885,*II*,The men observe the Rules of Thought.
886,*II*,They love the Good; they worship Truth;
887,*II*,They laugh uproariously in youth;
888,*II*,"(And when they get to feeling old,"
889,*II*,"They up and shoot themselves, I’m told)...."
890,*II*,
891,*II*,Ah God! to see the branches stir
892,*II*,Across the moon at Grantchester!
893,*II*,To smell the thrilling-sweet and rotten
894,*II*,"Unforgettable, unforgotten"
895,*II*,"River-smell, and hear the breeze"
896,*II*,Sobbing in the little trees.
897,*II*,"Say, do the elm-clumps greatly stand,"
898,*II*,Still guardians of that holy land?
899,*II*,"The chestnuts shade, in reverend dream,"
900,*II*,The yet unacademic stream?
901,*II*,Is dawn a secret shy and cold
902,*II*,"Anadyomene, silver-gold?"
903,*II*,And sunset still a golden sea
904,*II*,From Haslingfield to Madingley?
905,*II*,"And after, ere the night is born,"
906,*II*,Do hares come out about the corn?
907,*II*,"Oh, is the water sweet and cool,"
908,*II*,"Gentle and brown, above the pool?"
909,*II*,And laughs the immortal river still
910,*II*,"Under the mill, under the mill?"
911,*II*,"Say, is there Beauty yet to find?"
912,*II*,And Certainty? and Quiet kind?
913,*II*,"Deep meadows yet, for to forget"
914,*II*,"The lies, and truths, and pain? ... oh! yet"
915,*II*,Stands the Church clock at ten to three?
916,*II*,And is there honey still for tea?

921,*II*,*The Funeral of Youth: Threnody*
922,*II*,
923,*II*,"The day that _Youth_ had died,"
924,*II*,"There came to his grave-side,"
925,*II*,"In decent mourning, from the county’s ends,"
926,*II*,Those scattered friends
927,*II*,"Who had lived the boon companions of his prime,"
928,*II*,"And laughed with him and sung with him and wasted,"
929,*II*,"In feast and wine and many-crown’d carouse,"
930,*II*,The days and nights and dawnings of the time
931,*II*,"When _Youth_ kept open house,"
932,*II*,Nor left untasted
933,*II*,"Aught of his high emprise and ventures dear,"
934,*II*,No quest of his unshar’d—
935,*II*,"All these, with loitering feet and sad head bar’d,"
936,*II*,Followed their old friend’s bier.
937,*II*,"_Folly_ went first,"
938,*II*,With muffled bells and coxcomb still revers’d;
939,*II*,"And after trod the bearers, hat in hand—"
940,*II*,"_Laughter_, most hoarse, and Captain _Pride_ with tanned"
941,*II*,"And martial face all grim, and fussy _Joy_,"
942,*II*,"Who had to catch a train, and _Lust_, poor, snivelling boy;"
943,*II*,These bore the dear departed.
944,*II*,"Behind them, broken-hearted,"
945,*II*,"Came _Grief_, so noisy a widow, that all said,"
946,*II*,"""Had he but wed"
947,*II*,"Her elder sister _Sorrow_, in her stead."""
948,*II*,"And by her, trying to soothe her all the time,"
949,*II*,"The fatherless children, _Colour_, _Tune_, and _Rhyme_"
950,*II*,"(The sweet lad _Rhyme_), ran all-uncomprehending."
951,*II*,"Then, at the way’s sad ending,"
952,*II*,"Round the raw grave they stay’d.  Old _Wisdom_ read,"
953,*II*,"In mumbling tone, the Service for the Dead."
954,*II*,"There stood _Romance_,"
955,*II*,The furrowing tears had mark’d her rougèd cheek;
956,*II*,"Poor old _Conceit_, his wonder unassuag’d;"
957,*II*,"Dead _Innocency’s_ daughter, _Ignorance_;"
958,*II*,"And shabby, ill-dress’d _Generosity_;"
959,*II*,"And _Argument_, too full of woe to speak;"
960,*II*,"_Passion_, grown portly, something middle-aged;"
961,*II*,"And _Friendship_—not a minute older, she;"
962,*II*,"_Impatience_, ever taking out his watch;"
963,*II*,"_Faith_, who was deaf, and had to lean to catch"
964,*II*,Old _Wisdom’s_ endless drone.
965,*II*,"_Beauty_ was there,"
966,*II*,Pale in her black; dry-eyed; she stood alone.
967,*II*,Poor maz’d _Imagination_; _Fancy_ wild;
968,*II*,"_Ardour_, the sunlight on his greying hair;"
969,*II*,"_Contentment_, who had known _Youth_ as a child"
970,*II*,"And never seen him since.  And _Spring_ came too,"
971,*II*,"Dancing over the tombs, and brought him flowers—"
972,*II*,She did not stay for long.
973,*II*,"And _Truth_, and _Grace_, and all the merry crew,"
974,*II*,"The laughing _Winds_ and _Rivers_, and lithe _Hours_;"
975,*II*,"And _Hope_, the dewy-eyed; and sorrowing _Song_;—"
976,*II*,"Yes, with much woe and mourning general,"
977,*II*,"At dead _Youth’s_ funeral,"
978,*II*,"Even these were met once more together, all,"
979,*II*,Who erst the fair and living _Youth_ did know;
980,*II*,"All, except only _Love_.  _Love_ had died long ago."

990,*II*,"And scattering-bright the air,"
991,*II*,"Eddying, dizzying, closing round,"
992,*II*,With soft and drunken laughter;

994,*II*,After—after—
995,*II*,
996,*II*,"Where Beauty and Beauty met,"
997,*II*,"Earth’s still a-tremble there,"
998,*II*,"And winds are scented yet,"
999,*II*,"And memory-soft the air,"
1000,*II*,"Bosoming, folding glints of light,"
1001,*II*,And shreds of shadowy laughter;
1002,*II*,Not the tears that fill the years

1012,*II*,"—Oh, I’ve loved you faithfully and well,"
1013,*II*,"Three years, or a bit less."
1014,*II*,It wasn’t a success.
1015,*II*,
1016,*II*,"Thank God, that’s done! and I’ll take the road,"
1017,*II*,"Quit of my youth and you,"
1018,*II*,The Roman road to Wendover
1019,*II*,"By Tring and Lilley Hoo,"
1020,*II*,As a free man may do.
1021,*II*,
1022,*II*,"For youth goes over, the joys that fly,"
1023,*II*,The tears that follow fast;
1024,*II*,And the dirtiest things we do must lie
1025,*II*,Forgotten at the last;
1026,*II*,Even Love goes past.
1027,*II*,
1028,*II*,"What’s left behind I shall not find,"
1029,*II*,The splendour and the pain;
1030,*II*,"The splash of sun, the shouting wind,"
1031,*II*,"And the brave sting of rain,"
1032,*II*,I may not meet again.
1033,*II*,
1034,*II*,"But the years, that take the best away,"
1035,*II*,Give something in the end;
1036,*II*,"And a better friend than love have they,"
1037,*II*,"For none to mar or mend,"
1038,*II*,That have themselves to friend.
1039,*II*,
1040,*II*,I shall desire and I shall find
1041,*II*,The best of my desires;
1042,*II*,"The autumn road, the mellow wind"
1043,*II*,That soothes the darkening shires.
1044,*II*,"And laughter, and inn-fires."
1045,*II*,
1046,*II*,"White mist about the black hedgerows,"
1047,*II*,"The slumbering Midland plain,"
1048,*II*,"The silence where the clover grows,"
1049,*II*,"And the dead leaves in the lane,"
1050,*II*,"Certainly, these remain."
1051,*II*,
1052,*II*,"And I shall find some girl perhaps,"
1053,*II*,"And a better one than you,"
1054,*II*,"With eyes as wise, but kindlier,"
1055,*II*,"And lips as soft, but true."
1056,*II*,And I daresay she will do.

1061,*II*,*Love*
1062,*II*,
1063,*II*,"Love is a breach in the walls, a broken gate,"
1064,*II*,Where that comes in that shall not go again;
1065,*II*,Love sells the proud heart’s citadel to Fate.
1066,*II*,"They have known shame, who love unloved.  Even then"
1067,*II*,"When two mouths, thirsty each for each, find slaking,"
1068,*II*,"And agony’s forgot, and hushed the crying"
1069,*II*,"Of credulous hearts, in heaven—such are but taking"
1070,*II*,"Their own poor dreams within their arms, and lying"
1071,*II*,"Each in his lonely night, each with a ghost."
1072,*II*,"Some share that night.  But they know, love grows colder,"
1073,*II*,"Grows false and dull, that was sweet lies at most."
1074,*II*,"Astonishment is no more in hand or shoulder,"
1075,*II*,"But darkens, and dies out from kiss to kiss."

1085,*II*,"(O heart, I do not dare go empty-hearted)"
1086,*II*,"I’ll think of Love in books, Love without end;"
1087,*II*,"Women with child, content; and old men sleeping;"
1088,*II*,"And wet strong ploughlands, scarred for certain grain;"
1089,*II*,"And babes that weep, and so forget their weeping;"
1090,*II*,"And the young heavens, forgetful after rain;"
1091,*II*,"And evening hush, broken by homing wings;"
1092,*II*,"And Song’s nobility, and Wisdom holy,"
1093,*II*,"That live, we dead.  I would think of a thousand things,"
1094,*II*,"Lovely and durable, and taste them slowly,"
1095,*II*,"One after one, like tasting a sweet food."
1096,*II*,I have need to busy my heart with quietude.

1106,*II*,"For, who decries the loved, decries the lover;"
1107,*II*,Yet what man lauds the thing he’s thrown away?
1108,*II*,
1109,*II*,"Be you, in truth, this dull, slight, cloudy naught,"
1110,*II*,"The more fool I, so great a fool to adore;"
1111,*II*,"But if you’re that high goddess once I thought,"
1112,*II*,"The more your godhead is, I lose the more."
1113,*II*,
1114,*II*,"Dear fool, pity the fool who thought you clever!"
1115,*II*,"Dear wisdom, do not mock the fool that missed you!"
1116,*II*,"Most fair,—the blind has lost your face for ever!"
1117,*II*,"Most foul,—how could I see you while I kissed you?"

1131,*II*,"And a shade, through the toss’d ranks of mirth and crying,"
1132,*II*,"Hungers, and pains, and each dull passionate mood,—"
1133,*II*,"Quite lost, and all but all forgot, undying,"
1134,*II*,Comes back the ecstasy of your quietude.
1135,*II*,
1136,*II*,"So a poor ghost, beside his misty streams,"
1137,*II*,"Is haunted by strange doubts, evasive dreams,"
1138,*II*,"Hints of a pre-Lethean life, of men,"
1139,*II*,"Stars, rocks, and flesh, things unintelligible,"

1513,"MATAIEA, 1914",Where I’ll unpack that scented store

1515,"MATAIEA, 1914","And count, and touch, and turn them o’er,"

1527,"MATAIEA, 1914",
1528,"MATAIEA, 1914","Now, God be thanked Who has matched us with His hour,"
1529,"MATAIEA, 1914","And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping,"
1530,"MATAIEA, 1914","With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,"
1531,"MATAIEA, 1914","To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping,"
1532,"MATAIEA, 1914","Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary,"
1533,"MATAIEA, 1914","Leave the sick hearts that honour could not move,"
1534,"MATAIEA, 1914","And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,"
1535,"MATAIEA, 1914",And all the little emptiness of love!
1536,"MATAIEA, 1914",
1537,"MATAIEA, 1914","Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there,"
1538,"MATAIEA, 1914","Where there’s no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending,"
1539,"MATAIEA, 1914","Naught broken save this body, lost but breath;"
1540,"MATAIEA, 1914",Nothing to shake the laughing heart’s long peace there
1541,"MATAIEA, 1914","But only agony, and that has ending;"
1542,"MATAIEA, 1914",And the worst friend and enemy is but Death.

1548,"MATAIEA, 1914","He who has found our hid security,"
1549,"MATAIEA, 1914","Assured in the dark tides of the world that rest,"
1550,"MATAIEA, 1914","And heard our word, ’Who is so safe as we?’"
1551,"MATAIEA, 1914","We have found safety with all things undying,"
1552,"MATAIEA, 1914","The winds, and morning, tears of men and mirth,"
1553,"MATAIEA, 1914","The deep night, and birds singing, and clouds flying,"
1554,"MATAIEA, 1914","And sleep, and freedom, and the autumnal earth."
1555,"MATAIEA, 1914",
1556,"MATAIEA, 1914",We have built a house that is not for Time’s throwing.
1557,"MATAIEA, 1914",We have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever.
1558,"MATAIEA, 1914","War knows no power.  Safe shall be my going,"
1559,"MATAIEA, 1914",Secretly armed against all death’s endeavour;
1560,"MATAIEA, 1914",Safe though all safety’s lost; safe where men fall;
1561,"MATAIEA, 1914","And if these poor limbs die, safest of all."

1567,"MATAIEA, 1914","There’s none of these so lonely and poor of old,"
1568,"MATAIEA, 1914","But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold."
1569,"MATAIEA, 1914",These laid the world away; poured out the red
1570,"MATAIEA, 1914",Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be
1571,"MATAIEA, 1914","Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene,"
1572,"MATAIEA, 1914","That men call age; and those who would have been,"
1573,"MATAIEA, 1914","Their sons, they gave, their immortality."
1574,"MATAIEA, 1914",
1575,"MATAIEA, 1914","Blow, bugles, blow!  They brought us, for our dearth,"
1576,"MATAIEA, 1914","Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain."
1577,"MATAIEA, 1914","Honour has come back, as a king, to earth,"
1578,"MATAIEA, 1914",And paid his subjects with a royal wage;
1579,"MATAIEA, 1914",And Nobleness walks in our ways again;

1585,"MATAIEA, 1914",These hearts were woven of human joys and cares.
1586,"MATAIEA, 1914","Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth."
1587,"MATAIEA, 1914","The years had given them kindness.  Dawn was theirs,"
1588,"MATAIEA, 1914","And sunset, and the colours of the earth."
1589,"MATAIEA, 1914","These had seen movement, and heard music; known"
1590,"MATAIEA, 1914",Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended;
1591,"MATAIEA, 1914",Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone;
1592,"MATAIEA, 1914",Touched flowers and furs and cheeks.  All this is ended.
1593,"MATAIEA, 1914",
1594,"MATAIEA, 1914",There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter
1595,"MATAIEA, 1914","And lit by the rich skies, all day.  And after,"
1596,"MATAIEA, 1914","Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that dance"

1606,"MATAIEA, 1914",That is for ever England.  There shall be
1607,"MATAIEA, 1914",In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
1608,"MATAIEA, 1914","A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,"
1609,"MATAIEA, 1914","Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,"
1610,"MATAIEA, 1914","A body of England’s breathing English air,"

1645,GUILDFORD AND ESHER,"early as 1905, when he was eighteen, shows an art curiously personal,"
1646,GUILDFORD AND ESHER,"skilful, deliberate.  It shows, too, an intellectual deftness altogether"
1647,GUILDFORD AND ESHER,"unexpected in so young a poet, and it shows finally, not always but"
1648,GUILDFORD AND ESHER,"often, an indifference to the normal material upon which poets good and"
1649,GUILDFORD AND ESHER,"bad are apt to work from the outset, and in the shaping of which"
