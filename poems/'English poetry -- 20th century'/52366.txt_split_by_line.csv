131,THE IMP WITHIN,
132,THE IMP WITHIN,
133,THE IMP WITHIN,"'ROUSE now, my dullard, and thy wits awake;"
134,THE IMP WITHIN,'Tis first of the morning. And I bid thee make—
135,THE IMP WITHIN,"No, not a vow; we have munched our fill of these"
136,THE IMP WITHIN,From crock of bone-dry crusts and mouse-gnawn cheese—
137,THE IMP WITHIN,"Nay, just one whisper in that long, long ear—"
138,THE IMP WITHIN,Awake; rejoice. Another Day is here:—
139,THE IMP WITHIN,
140,THE IMP WITHIN,"'A virgin wilderness, which, hour by hour,"
141,THE IMP WITHIN,Mere happy idleness shall bring to flower.
142,THE IMP WITHIN,"Barren and arid though its sands now seem,"
143,THE IMP WITHIN,"Wherein oasis becks not, shines no stream,"
144,THE IMP WITHIN,"Yet wake—and lo, 'tis lovelier than a dream."
145,THE IMP WITHIN,
146,THE IMP WITHIN,"'Plunge on, thy every footprint shall make fair"
147,THE IMP WITHIN,Its thirsty waste; and thy foregone despair
148,THE IMP WITHIN,"Undarken into sweet birds in the air,"
149,THE IMP WITHIN,Whose coursing wings and love-crazed summoning cries
150,THE IMP WITHIN,Into infinity shall attract thine eyes.
151,THE IMP WITHIN,
152,THE IMP WITHIN,"'No...? Well, lest promise in performance faint,"
153,THE IMP WITHIN,A less inviting prospect will I paint.
154,THE IMP WITHIN,"I bid thee adjure thy Yesterday, and say:"
155,THE IMP WITHIN,"""As _thou_ wast, Enemy, so be To-day.—"
156,THE IMP WITHIN,Immure me in the same close narrow room;
157,THE IMP WITHIN,Be hated toil the lamp to light its gloom;
158,THE IMP WITHIN,Make stubborn my pen; sift dust into my ink;
159,THE IMP WITHIN,"Forbid mine eyes to see, my brain to think."
160,THE IMP WITHIN,Scare off the words whereon the mind is set.
161,THE IMP WITHIN,Make memory the power to forget.
162,THE IMP WITHIN,Constrain imagination; bind its wing;
163,THE IMP WITHIN,Forbid the unseen Enchantresses to sing.
164,THE IMP WITHIN,"Ay, do thy worst!"""
165,THE IMP WITHIN,
166,THE IMP WITHIN,"'Vexed Spectre, prythee smile."
167,THE IMP WITHIN,"Even though that yesterday was bleak and sour,"
168,THE IMP WITHIN,Art thou a slave beneath its thong to cower?
169,THE IMP WITHIN,"Thou hast survived. And hither am I—again,"
170,THE IMP WITHIN,Kindling with mockery thy o'erlaboured brain.
171,THE IMP WITHIN,"Though scant the moments be wherein we meet,"
172,THE IMP WITHIN,"Think, what dark months would even one make sweet."
173,THE IMP WITHIN,
174,THE IMP WITHIN,"'Thy quill? Thy paper? Ah, my dear, be true."
175,THE IMP WITHIN,"Come quick To-morrow. Until then, Adieu.'"

180,THE OLD ANGLER,THE OLD ANGLER
181,THE OLD ANGLER,
182,THE OLD ANGLER,
183,THE OLD ANGLER,TWILIGHT leaned mirrored in a pool
184,THE OLD ANGLER,"Where willow boughs swept green and hoar,"
185,THE OLD ANGLER,"Silk-clear the water, calm and cool,"
186,THE OLD ANGLER,Silent the weedy shore:
187,THE OLD ANGLER,
188,THE OLD ANGLER,"There in abstracted, brooding mood"
189,THE OLD ANGLER,One fishing sate. His painted float
190,THE OLD ANGLER,Motionless as a planet stood;
191,THE OLD ANGLER,Motionless his boat.
192,THE OLD ANGLER,
193,THE OLD ANGLER,"A melancholy soul was this,"
194,THE OLD ANGLER,"With lantern jaw, gnarled hand, vague eye;"
195,THE OLD ANGLER,Huddled in pensive solitariness
196,THE OLD ANGLER,He had fished existence by.
197,THE OLD ANGLER,
198,THE OLD ANGLER,Empty his creel; stolen his bait—
199,THE OLD ANGLER,"Impassively he angled on,"
200,THE OLD ANGLER,Though mist now showed the evening late
201,THE OLD ANGLER,And daylight well-nigh gone.
202,THE OLD ANGLER,
203,THE OLD ANGLER,"Suddenly, like a tongueless bell,"
204,THE OLD ANGLER,Downward his gaudy cork did glide;
205,THE OLD ANGLER,"A deep, low-gathering, gentle swell"
206,THE OLD ANGLER,Spread slowly far and wide.
207,THE OLD ANGLER,
208,THE OLD ANGLER,"Wheeped out his tackle from noiseless winch,"
209,THE OLD ANGLER,"And furtive as a thief, his thumb,"
210,THE OLD ANGLER,"With nerve intense, wound inch by inch"
211,THE OLD ANGLER,A line no longer numb.
212,THE OLD ANGLER,
213,THE OLD ANGLER,What fabulous spoil could thus unplayed
214,THE OLD ANGLER,Gape upward to a mortal air?—
215,THE OLD ANGLER,He stoops engrossed; his tanned cheek greyed;
216,THE OLD ANGLER,"His heart stood still: for there,"
217,THE OLD ANGLER,
218,THE OLD ANGLER,"Wondrously fairing, beneath the skin"
219,THE OLD ANGLER,"Of secretly bubbling water seen,"
220,THE OLD ANGLER,Swims—not the silver of scale and fin—
221,THE OLD ANGLER,But gold immixt with green.
222,THE OLD ANGLER,
223,THE OLD ANGLER,"Deeply astir in oozy bed,"
224,THE OLD ANGLER,The darkening mirror ripples and rocks:
225,THE OLD ANGLER,"And lo—a wan-pale, lovely head,"
226,THE OLD ANGLER,Hook tangled in its locks!
227,THE OLD ANGLER,
228,THE OLD ANGLER,Cold from her haunt—a Naiad slim.
229,THE OLD ANGLER,Shoulder and cheek gleamed ivory white;
230,THE OLD ANGLER,"Though now faint stars stood over him,"
231,THE OLD ANGLER,The hour hard on night.
232,THE OLD ANGLER,
233,THE OLD ANGLER,Her green eyes gazed like one half-blind
234,THE OLD ANGLER,In sudden radiance; her breast
235,THE OLD ANGLER,"Breathed the sweet air, while gently twined,"
236,THE OLD ANGLER,"'Gainst the cold water pressed,"
237,THE OLD ANGLER,
238,THE OLD ANGLER,"Her lean webbed hands. She floated there,"
239,THE OLD ANGLER,"Light as a scentless petalled flower,"
240,THE OLD ANGLER,Water-drops dewing from her hair
241,THE OLD ANGLER,In tinkling beadlike shower.
242,THE OLD ANGLER,
243,THE OLD ANGLER,"So circling sidelong, her tender throat"
244,THE OLD ANGLER,"Uttered a grieving, desolate wail;"
245,THE OLD ANGLER,"Shrill o'er the dark pool lapsed its note,"
246,THE OLD ANGLER,Piteous as nightingale.
247,THE OLD ANGLER,
248,THE OLD ANGLER,Ceased Echo. And he?—a life's remorse
249,THE OLD ANGLER,"Welled to a tongue unapt to charm,"
250,THE OLD ANGLER,But never a word broke harsh and hoarse
251,THE OLD ANGLER,To quiet her alarm.
252,THE OLD ANGLER,
253,THE OLD ANGLER,With infinite stealth his twitching thumb
254,THE OLD ANGLER,"Tugged softly at the tautened gut,"
255,THE OLD ANGLER,"Bubble-light, fair, her lips now dumb,"
256,THE OLD ANGLER,"She moved, and struggled not;"
257,THE OLD ANGLER,
258,THE OLD ANGLER,"But with set, wild, unearthly eyes"
259,THE OLD ANGLER,"Pale-gleaming, fixed as if in fear,"
260,THE OLD ANGLER,"She couched in the water, with quickening sighs,"
261,THE OLD ANGLER,And floated near.
262,THE OLD ANGLER,
263,THE OLD ANGLER,In hollow heaven the stars were at play;
264,THE OLD ANGLER,Wan glow-worms greened the pool-side grass;
265,THE OLD ANGLER,Dipped the wide-bellied boat. His prey
266,THE OLD ANGLER,Gazed on; nor breathed. Alas!—
267,THE OLD ANGLER,
268,THE OLD ANGLER,Long sterile years had come and gone;
269,THE OLD ANGLER,"Youth, like a distant dream, was sped;"
270,THE OLD ANGLER,"Heart, hope, and eyes had hungered on...."
271,THE OLD ANGLER,"He turned a shaking head,"
272,THE OLD ANGLER,
273,THE OLD ANGLER,"And clumsily groped amid the gold,"
274,THE OLD ANGLER,"Sleek with night dews, of that tangling hair,"
275,THE OLD ANGLER,Till pricked his finger keen and cold
276,THE OLD ANGLER,The barb imbedded there.
277,THE OLD ANGLER,
278,THE OLD ANGLER,"Teeth clenched, he drew his knife—'Snip, snip,'—"
279,THE OLD ANGLER,"Groaned, and sate shivering back; and she,"
280,THE OLD ANGLER,"Treading the water with birdlike dip,"
281,THE OLD ANGLER,Shook her sweet shoulders free:
282,THE OLD ANGLER,
283,THE OLD ANGLER,"Drew backward, smiling, infatuate fair,"
284,THE OLD ANGLER,"His life's disasters in her eyes,"
285,THE OLD ANGLER,"All longing and folly, grief, despair,"
286,THE OLD ANGLER,Daydreams and mysteries.
287,THE OLD ANGLER,
288,THE OLD ANGLER,"She stooped her brow; laid low her cheek,"
289,THE OLD ANGLER,"And, steering on that silk-tressed craft,"
290,THE OLD ANGLER,"Out from the listening, leaf-hung creek,"
291,THE OLD ANGLER,"Tossed up her chin, and laughed—"
292,THE OLD ANGLER,
293,THE OLD ANGLER,"A mocking, icy, inhuman note."
294,THE OLD ANGLER,"One instant flashed that crystal breast,"
295,THE OLD ANGLER,"Leaned, and was gone. Dead-still the boat:"
296,THE OLD ANGLER,And the deep dark at rest.
297,THE OLD ANGLER,
298,THE OLD ANGLER,Flits moth to flower. A water-rat
299,THE OLD ANGLER,Noses the placid ripple. And lo!
300,THE OLD ANGLER,"Streams a lost meteor. Night is late,"
301,THE OLD ANGLER,And daybreak zephyrs flow....
302,THE OLD ANGLER,
303,THE OLD ANGLER,"And he—the cheated? Dusk till morn,"
304,THE OLD ANGLER,"Insensate, even of hope forsook,"
305,THE OLD ANGLER,"He muttering squats, aloof, forlorn,"
306,THE OLD ANGLER,Dangling a baitless hook.
307,THE OLD ANGLER,
308,THE OLD ANGLER,
309,THE OLD ANGLER,
310,THE OLD ANGLER,
311,THE WILLOW,THE WILLOW
312,THE WILLOW,
313,THE WILLOW,
314,THE WILLOW,"LEANS now the fair willow, dreaming"
315,THE WILLOW,Amid her locks of green.
316,THE WILLOW,"In the driving snow she was parched and cold,"
317,THE WILLOW,And in midnight hath been
318,THE WILLOW,"Swept by blasts of the void night,"
319,THE WILLOW,Lashed by the rains.
320,THE WILLOW,Now of that wintry dark and bleak
321,THE WILLOW,No memory remains.
322,THE WILLOW,
323,THE WILLOW,In mute desire she sways softly;
324,THE WILLOW,Thrilling sap up-flows;
325,THE WILLOW,"She praises God in her beauty and grace,"
326,THE WILLOW,Whispers delight. And there flows
327,THE WILLOW,"A delicate wind from the Southern seas,"
328,THE WILLOW,Kissing her leaves. She sighs.
329,THE WILLOW,While the birds in her tresses make merry;
330,THE WILLOW,Burns the Sun in the skies.

339,TITMOUSE,"Dangle a palm-nut from a tree,"
340,TITMOUSE,"Idly in green to sway and spin,"
341,TITMOUSE,"Its snow-pulped kernel for bait; and see,"
342,TITMOUSE,A nimble titmouse enter in.
343,TITMOUSE,
344,TITMOUSE,"Out of earth's vast unknown of air,"
345,TITMOUSE,"Out of all summer, from wave to wave,"
346,TITMOUSE,"He'll perch, and prank his feathers fair,"
347,TITMOUSE,"Jangle a glass-clear wildering stave,"
348,TITMOUSE,And take his commons there—
349,TITMOUSE,
350,TITMOUSE,"This tiny son of life; this spright,"
351,TITMOUSE,"By momentary Human sought,"
352,TITMOUSE,"Plume will his wing in the dappling light,"
353,TITMOUSE,Clash timbrel shrill and gay—
354,TITMOUSE,"And into time's enormous nought,"
355,TITMOUSE,"Sweet-fed, will flit away."

361,THE VEIL,
362,THE VEIL,
363,THE VEIL,I think and think; yet still I fail—
364,THE VEIL,Why does this lady wear a veil?
365,THE VEIL,Why thus elect to mask her face
366,THE VEIL,Beneath that dainty web of lace?
367,THE VEIL,"The tip of a small nose I see,"
368,THE VEIL,"And two red lips, set curiously"
369,THE VEIL,"Like twin-born cherries on one stem,"

371,THE VEIL,"Her eyes, it's plain, survey with ease"
372,THE VEIL,Whatever to glance upon they please.
373,THE VEIL,"Yet, whether hazel, grey, or blue,"
374,THE VEIL,"Or that even lovelier lilac hue,"
375,THE VEIL,I cannot guess: why—why deny
376,THE VEIL,Such beauty to the passer-by?
377,THE VEIL,Out of a bush a nightingale
378,THE VEIL,May expound his song; beneath that veil
379,THE VEIL,A happy mouth no doubt can make
380,THE VEIL,English sound sweeter for its sake.
381,THE VEIL,"But then, why muffle in, like this,"
382,THE VEIL,What every blossomy wind would kiss?
383,THE VEIL,Why in that little night disguise
384,THE VEIL,"A daybreak face, those starry eyes?"

393,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,
394,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,THERE was a Fairy—flake of winter—
395,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,"Who, when the snow came, whispering, Silence,"
396,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,"Sister crystal to crystal sighing,"
397,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,"Making of meadow argent palace,"
398,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,"Night a star-sown solitude,"
399,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,"Cried 'neath her frozen eaves, 'I burn here!'"
400,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,
401,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,"Wings diaphanous, beating bee-like,"
402,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,"Wand within fingers, locks enspangled,"
403,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,"Icicle foot, lip sharp as scarlet,"
404,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,She lifted her eyes in her pitch-black hollow—
405,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,Green as stalks of weeds in water—
406,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,Breathed: stirred.
407,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,
408,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,"Rilled from her heart the ichor, coursing,"
409,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,Flamed and awoke her slumbering magic.
410,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,Softlier than moth's her pinions trembled;
411,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,"Out into blackness, light-like, she flittered,"
412,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,"Leaving her hollow cold, forsaken."
413,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,
414,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,"In air, o'er crystal, rang twangling night-wind."
415,THE FAIRY IN WINTER,"Bare, rimed pine-woods murmured lament."

427,THE FLOWER,
428,THE FLOWER,The huge world's sun flames on the snow-capped hills;

431,THE FLOWER,The cold profuse abundance of the rain.

434,THE FLOWER,"Sighs o'er a universe transcending thought,"
435,THE FLOWER,"Afflicted by vague bodings of the past,"

439,THE FLOWER,"That meeks its blossom in his anxious eye,"
440,THE FLOWER,"Mark how he grieves, as if his heart did bleed,"
441,THE FLOWER,And wheels his wondrous features to the sky;

443,THE FLOWER,He sought Companion in earth's dwelling-place.

842,THE MONOLOGUE,The yawning sack.
843,THE MONOLOGUE,
844,THE MONOLOGUE,"Lean closer, then;"

847,THE MONOLOGUE,Thine eyelids call:
848,THE MONOLOGUE,"'Courage, my brother,' Nought"
849,THE MONOLOGUE,Can then appal.
850,THE MONOLOGUE,
851,THE MONOLOGUE,"Yet coward, coward am I,"
852,THE MONOLOGUE,And drink I must

854,THE MONOLOGUE,With the longed-for crust;
855,THE MONOLOGUE,Though heart within is sour
856,THE MONOLOGUE,With disgust.

859,THE MONOLOGUE,"When mutely tapping—well,"

861,THE MONOLOGUE,I these tidings tell?
862,THE MONOLOGUE,Knock these numb fingers against
863,THE MONOLOGUE,An empty cell?
864,THE MONOLOGUE,
865,THE MONOLOGUE,"Nay, answer not."
866,THE MONOLOGUE,Let still mere longing make
867,THE MONOLOGUE,"Thy presence sure to me,"

1047,_SOTTO VOCE_,"The air made visible in his ray,"
1048,_SOTTO VOCE_,"Like molten glass from furnace run,"
1049,_SOTTO VOCE_,Quivered o'er heat-baked turf and stone

1051,_SOTTO VOCE_,Burned softly as gold of a child's fair hair
1052,_SOTTO VOCE_,"Along each spiky spray, and shed"
1053,_SOTTO VOCE_,Almond-like incense in the air
1054,_SOTTO VOCE_,Whereon our senses fed.
1055,_SOTTO VOCE_,
1056,_SOTTO VOCE_,At foot—a few sparse harebells: blue
1057,_SOTTO VOCE_,And still as were the friend's dark eyes
1058,_SOTTO VOCE_,"That dwelt on mine, transfixèd through"
1059,_SOTTO VOCE_,With sudden ecstatic surmise.
1060,_SOTTO VOCE_,
1061,_SOTTO VOCE_,"'Hst!' he cried softly, smiling, and lo,"
1062,_SOTTO VOCE_,"Stealing amidst that maze gold-green,"
1063,_SOTTO VOCE_,I heard a whispering music flow
1064,_SOTTO VOCE_,"From guileful throat of bird, unseen:—"
1065,_SOTTO VOCE_,So delicate the straining ear
1066,_SOTTO VOCE_,Scarce carried its faint syllabling
1067,_SOTTO VOCE_,Into a heart caught-up to hear
1068,_SOTTO VOCE_,That inmost pondering
1069,_SOTTO VOCE_,"Of bird-like self with self. We stood,"
1070,_SOTTO VOCE_,"In happy trance-like solitude,"
1071,_SOTTO VOCE_,Hearkening a lullay grieved and sweet—

1083,_SOTTO VOCE_,Gently amused to see

1142,THE WANDERERS,As lovers will in woodlands bare.
1143,THE WANDERERS,"Nought heeded they where now they stood,"
1144,THE WANDERERS,Since theirs its alien solitude
1145,THE WANDERERS,Beyond imagination fair.
1146,THE WANDERERS,
1147,THE WANDERERS,The light an earthly candle gives
1148,THE WANDERERS,When it is quenched leaves only dark;

1163,THE WANDERERS,So in a gloomy London street
1164,THE WANDERERS,Princes from Eastern realms might pause

1237,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,From its weary body close-enwrapt in slumber
1238,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,Where its home and earth-friends are;
1239,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,
1240,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,A milk-like air—and of light all abundance;
1241,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,And there a river clear
1242,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Painting the scene like a picture on its bosom,"
1243,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,Green foliage drifting near.

1270,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Yet, happy beyond words, I marked their sunlit faces,"
1271,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Stealing soft enchantment from their eyes,"
1272,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Tears in my own confusing their small image,"
1273,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,Harkening their bead-like cries.

1275,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"They passed me, unseeing, a waft of flocking linnets;"

1346,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,
1347,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,UNTO blest Melancholy's house one happy day
1348,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,I took my way:
1349,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"Into a chamber was shown, whence could be seen"
1350,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"Her flowerless garden, dyed with sunlit green"
1351,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"Of myrtle, box, and bay."
1352,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,
1353,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"Cool were its walls, shade-mottled, green and gold,"
1354,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,In heavy fold
1355,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"Hung antique tapestries, from whose fruit and flower"
1356,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"Light had the bright hues stolen, hour by hour,"
1357,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,And time worn thin and old.
1358,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,
1359,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"Silence, as of a virginal laid aside,"
1360,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,Did there abide.
1361,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"But not for voice or music was I fain,"
1362,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,Only to see a long-loved face again—
1363,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,For her sole company sighed.
1364,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,
1365,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"And while I waited, giving memory praise,"
1366,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,My musing gaze
1367,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"Lit on the one sole picture in the room,"
1368,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"Which hung, as if in hiding, in the gloom"
1369,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,From evening's stealing rays.
1370,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,
1371,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"Framed in fast-fading gilt, a child gazed there,"

1374,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"On some poor desolate soul in banishment,"
1375,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,Mutely his grief to share.
1376,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,
1377,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"Long, long I stood in trance of that glad face,"
1378,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,Striving to trace
1379,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"The semblance that, disquieting, it bore"
1380,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"To one whom memory could not restore,"
1381,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,Nor fix in time and space.
1382,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,
1383,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"Sunk deep in brooding thus, a voice I heard"
1384,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,Whisper its word:
1385,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"I turned—and, stooping in the threshold, stood"
1386,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"She—the dark mistress of my solitude,"
1387,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"Who smiled, nor stirred."
1388,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,
1389,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,Her ghost gazed darkly from her pondering eyes
1390,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,Charged with surmise;
1391,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"Challenging mine, between mockery and fear,"
1392,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"She breathed her greeting, '_Thou_, my only dear!"
1393,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,Wherefore such heavy sighs?'
1394,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,
1395,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,'But this?' One instant lids her scrutiny veiled;
1396,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,Her wan cheek paled.
1397,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,'This child?' I asked. 'Its picture brings to mind
1398,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"Remembrance faint and far, past thought to find,"
1399,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,And yet by time unstaled.'
1400,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,
1401,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"Smiling, aloof, she turned her narrow head,"
1402,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"'Make thou my face thy glass,' she cried and said."
1403,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"'What would'st thou see therein—thine own, or mine?"
1404,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"O foolish one, what wonder thou did'st pine?"
1405,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,
1406,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,Long thou hast loved me; yet hast absent been.
1407,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,See now: Dark night hath pressed an entrance in.
1408,THE SON OF MELANCHOLY,"Jealous! thou dear? Nay, come; by taper's beam"

1806,A RIDDLE,Lapped shimmering in that sea-lulled lane.
1807,A RIDDLE,Hazel was budding; wan as snow
1808,A RIDDLE,The leafless blackthorn was a-blow.
1809,A RIDDLE,
1810,A RIDDLE,"A chaffinch clankt, a robin woke"
1811,A RIDDLE,An eerie stave in the leafless oak.
1812,A RIDDLE,Green mocked at green; lichen and moss
1813,A RIDDLE,The rain-worn slate did softly emboss.
1814,A RIDDLE,
1815,A RIDDLE,"From out her winter lair, at sigh"
1816,A RIDDLE,"Of the warm South wind, a butterfly"
1817,A RIDDLE,"Stepped, quaffed her honey; on painted fan"
1818,A RIDDLE,Her labyrinthine flight began.
1819,A RIDDLE,
1820,A RIDDLE,"Wondrously solemn, golden and fair,"
1821,A RIDDLE,The high sun's rays beat everywhere;

1824,A RIDDLE,Its light and life.
1825,A RIDDLE,
1826,A RIDDLE,O restless thought

1870,THE LAST COACHLOAD,
1871,THE LAST COACHLOAD,(To Colin)
1872,THE LAST COACHLOAD,
1873,THE LAST COACHLOAD,CRASHED through the woods that lumbering Coach. The dust
1874,THE LAST COACHLOAD,Of flinted roads bepowdering felloe and hood.
1875,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Its gay paint cracked, its axles red with rust,"
1876,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"It lunged, lurched, toppled through a solitude"
1877,THE LAST COACHLOAD,
1878,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Of whispering boughs, and feathery, nid-nod grass."
1879,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Plodded the fetlocked horses. Glum and mum,"
1880,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Its ancient Coachman recked not where he was,"
1881,THE LAST COACHLOAD,Nor into what strange haunt his wheels were come.
1882,THE LAST COACHLOAD,
1883,THE LAST COACHLOAD,Crumbling the leather of his dangling reins;
1884,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Worn to a cow's tuft his stumped, idle whip;"
1885,THE LAST COACHLOAD,Sharp eyes of beast and bird in the trees' green lanes
1886,THE LAST COACHLOAD,Gleamed out like stars above a derelict ship.
1887,THE LAST COACHLOAD,
1888,THE LAST COACHLOAD,'Old Father Time—Time—Time!' jeered twittering throat.
1889,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"A squirrel capered on the leader's rump,"
1890,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Slithered a weasel, peered a thieflike stoat,"
1891,THE LAST COACHLOAD,In sandy warren beat on the coney's thump.
1892,THE LAST COACHLOAD,
1893,THE LAST COACHLOAD,Mute as a mammet in his saddle sate
1894,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"The hunched Postilion, clad in magpie trim;"
1895,THE LAST COACHLOAD,Buzzed the bright flies around his hairless pate;
1896,THE LAST COACHLOAD,Yaffle and jay squawked mockery at him.
1897,THE LAST COACHLOAD,
1898,THE LAST COACHLOAD,Yet marvellous peace and amity breathed there.
1899,THE LAST COACHLOAD,Tranquil the labyrinths of this sundown wood.
1900,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Musking its chaces, bloomed the brier-rose fair;"
1901,THE LAST COACHLOAD,Spellbound as if in trance the pine-trees stood.
1902,THE LAST COACHLOAD,
1903,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Through moss, and pebbled rut, the wheels rasped on;"
1904,THE LAST COACHLOAD,That Ancient drowsing on his box. And still
1905,THE LAST COACHLOAD,The bracken track with glazing sunbeams shone;
1906,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Laboured the horses, straining at the hill...."
1907,THE LAST COACHLOAD,
1908,THE LAST COACHLOAD,But now—a verdurous height with eve-shade sweet;
1909,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Far, far to West the Delectable Mountains glowed."
1910,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Above, Night's canopy; at the horses' feet"
1911,THE LAST COACHLOAD,A sea-like honied waste of flowers flowed.
1912,THE LAST COACHLOAD,
1913,THE LAST COACHLOAD,There fell a pause of utter quiet. And—
1914,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Out from one murky window glanced an eye,"
1915,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Stole from the other a lean, groping hand,"
1916,THE LAST COACHLOAD,The padded door swung open with a sigh.
1917,THE LAST COACHLOAD,
1918,THE LAST COACHLOAD,And—_Exeunt Omnes!_ None to ask the fare—
1919,THE LAST COACHLOAD,A myriad human Odds in a last release
1920,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Leap out incontinent, snuff the incensed air;"
1921,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"A myriad parched-up voices whisper, 'Peace.'"
1922,THE LAST COACHLOAD,
1923,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"On, on, and on—a stream, a flood, they flow."
1924,THE LAST COACHLOAD,O wondrous vale of jocund buds and bells!
1925,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Like vanishing smoke the rainbow legions glow,"
1926,THE LAST COACHLOAD,Yet still the enravished concourse sweeps and swells.
1927,THE LAST COACHLOAD,
1928,THE LAST COACHLOAD,All journeying done. Rest now from lash and spur—
1929,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Laughing and weeping, shoulder and elbow—'twould seem"
1930,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"That Coach capacious all Infinity were,"
1931,THE LAST COACHLOAD,And these the fabulous figments of a dream.
1932,THE LAST COACHLOAD,
1933,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Mad for escape; frenzied each breathless mote,"
1934,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Lest rouse the Old Enemy from his death-still swoon,"
1935,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Lest crack that whip again—they fly, they float,"
1936,THE LAST COACHLOAD,"Scamper, breathe—'Paradise!' abscond, are gone...."
