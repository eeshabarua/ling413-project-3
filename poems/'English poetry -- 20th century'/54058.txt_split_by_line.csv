94,WEDDING MORN,
95,WEDDING MORN,
96,WEDDING MORN,The morning breaks like a pomegranate
97,WEDDING MORN,"In a shining crack of red,"
98,WEDDING MORN,"Ah, when to-morrow the dawn comes late"
99,WEDDING MORN,"Whitening across the bed,"
100,WEDDING MORN,It will find me watching at the marriage gate
101,WEDDING MORN,And waiting while light is shed
102,WEDDING MORN,"On him who is sleeping satiate,"
103,WEDDING MORN,"With a sunk, abandoned head."
104,WEDDING MORN,
105,WEDDING MORN,"And when the dawn comes creeping in,"
106,WEDDING MORN,Cautiously I shall raise
107,WEDDING MORN,Myself to watch the morning win
108,WEDDING MORN,"My first of days,"
109,WEDDING MORN,As it shows him sleeping a sleep he got
110,WEDDING MORN,"Of me, as under my gaze,"
111,WEDDING MORN,"He grows distinct, and I see his hot"
112,WEDDING MORN,Face freed of the wavering blaze.
113,WEDDING MORN,
114,WEDDING MORN,Then I shall know which image of God
115,WEDDING MORN,"My man is made toward,"
116,WEDDING MORN,And I shall know my bitter rod
117,WEDDING MORN,Or my rich reward.
118,WEDDING MORN,And I shall know the stamp and worth
119,WEDDING MORN,"Of the coin I've accepted as mine,"
120,WEDDING MORN,Shall see an image of heaven or of earth
121,WEDDING MORN,On his minted metal shine.
122,WEDDING MORN,
123,WEDDING MORN,Yea and I long to see him sleep
124,WEDDING MORN,"In my power utterly,"
125,WEDDING MORN,"I long to know what I have to keep,"
126,WEDDING MORN,I long to see
127,WEDDING MORN,"My love, that spinning coin, laid still"
128,WEDDING MORN,"And plain at the side of me,"
129,WEDDING MORN,For me to count--for I know he will
130,WEDDING MORN,Greatly enrichen me.
131,WEDDING MORN,
132,WEDDING MORN,"And then he will be mine, he will lie"
133,WEDDING MORN,"In my power utterly,"
134,WEDDING MORN,Opening his value plain to my eye
135,WEDDING MORN,He will sleep of me.
136,WEDDING MORN,"He will lie negligent, resign"
137,WEDDING MORN,"His all to me, and I"
138,WEDDING MORN,Shall watch the dawn light up for me
139,WEDDING MORN,This sleeping wealth of mine.
140,WEDDING MORN,
141,WEDDING MORN,And I shall watch the wan light shine
142,WEDDING MORN,"On his sleep that is filled of me,"
143,WEDDING MORN,On his brow where the wisps of fond hair twine
144,WEDDING MORN,"So truthfully,"
145,WEDDING MORN,On his lips where the light breaths come and go
146,WEDDING MORN,"Naïve and winsomely,"
147,WEDDING MORN,On his limbs that I shall weep to know
148,WEDDING MORN,Lie under my mastery.

153,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,KISSES IN THE TRAIN
154,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,
155,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,
156,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,I saw the midlands
157,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,Revolve through her hair;
158,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,The fields of autumn
159,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,"Stretching bare,"
160,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,And sheep on the pasture
161,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,Tossed back in a scare.
162,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,
163,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,And still as ever
164,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,"The world went round,"
165,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,My mouth on her pulsing
166,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,"Neck was found,"
167,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,And my breast to her beating
168,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,Breast was bound.
169,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,
170,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,But my heart at the centre
171,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,"Of all, in a swound"
172,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,"Was still as a pivot,"
173,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,As all the ground
174,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,On its prowling orbit
175,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,Shifted round.
176,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,
177,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,And still in my nostrils
178,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,"The scent of her flesh,"
179,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,And still my wet mouth
180,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,Sought her afresh;
181,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,And still one pulse
182,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,Through the world did thresh.
183,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,
184,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,And the world all whirling
185,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,Around in joy
186,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,Like the dance of a dervish
187,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,Did destroy
188,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,My sense--and my reason
189,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,Spun like a toy.
190,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,
191,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,But firm at the centre
192,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,My heart was found;
193,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,Her own to my perfect
194,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,"Heart-beat bound,"
195,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,Like a magnet's keeper
196,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,Closing the round.
197,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,
198,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,
199,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,
200,KISSES IN THE TRAIN,
201,CRUELTY AND LOVE,CRUELTY AND LOVE
202,CRUELTY AND LOVE,
203,CRUELTY AND LOVE,
204,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"What large, dark hands are those at the window"
205,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Lifted, grasping the golden light"
206,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves
207,CRUELTY AND LOVE,To my heart's delight?
208,CRUELTY AND LOVE,
209,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,"
210,CRUELTY AND LOVE,In the west I see a redness come
211,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Over the evening's burning breast--
212,CRUELTY AND LOVE,--'Tis the wound of love goes home!
213,CRUELTY AND LOVE,
214,CRUELTY AND LOVE,The woodbine creeps abroad
215,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Calling low to her lover:
216,CRUELTY AND LOVE,The sun-lit flirt who all the day
217,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Has poised above her lips in play
218,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"And stolen kisses, shallow and gay"
219,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Of pollen, now has gone away"
220,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"--She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,"
221,CRUELTY AND LOVE,And when above her his broad wings hover
222,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Then her bright breast she will uncover
223,CRUELTY AND LOVE,And yield her honey-drop to her lover.
224,CRUELTY AND LOVE,
225,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Into the yellow, evening glow"
226,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Saunters a man from the farm below,"
227,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed"
228,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.
229,CRUELTY AND LOVE,The bird lies warm against the wall.
230,CRUELTY AND LOVE,She glances quick her startled eyes
231,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Towards him, then she turns away"
232,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Her small head, making warm display"
233,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway
234,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,"
235,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies
236,CRUELTY AND LOVE,In one blue stoop from out the sties
237,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Into the evening's empty hall.
238,CRUELTY AND LOVE,
239,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes"
240,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,"
241,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,"
242,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.
243,CRUELTY AND LOVE,
244,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"The rabbit presses back her ears,"
245,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes"
246,CRUELTY AND LOVE,And crouches low: then with wild spring
247,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Spurts from the terror of _his_ oncoming
248,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"To be choked back, the wire ring"
249,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Her frantic effort throttling:
250,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!
251,CRUELTY AND LOVE,
252,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,"
253,CRUELTY AND LOVE,And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.
254,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Yet calm and kindly are his eyes
255,CRUELTY AND LOVE,And ready to open in brown surprise
256,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Should I not answer to his talk
257,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Or should he my tears surmise.
258,CRUELTY AND LOVE,
259,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair"
260,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Watching the door open: he flashes bare
261,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes"
262,CRUELTY AND LOVE,In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise
263,CRUELTY AND LOVE,He flings the rabbit soft on the table board
264,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword"
265,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad"
266,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Blade of his hand that raise my face to applaud
267,CRUELTY AND LOVE,His coming: he raises up my face to him
268,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim"
269,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!"
270,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"I know not what fine wire is round my throat,"
271,CRUELTY AND LOVE,I only know I let him finger there
272,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat"
273,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:
274,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down"
275,CRUELTY AND LOVE,His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood
276,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood"
277,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown"
278,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Within him, die, and find death good."
279,CRUELTY AND LOVE,

284,CHERRY ROBBERS,
285,CHERRY ROBBERS,
286,CHERRY ROBBERS,"Under the long, dark boughs, like jewels red"
287,CHERRY ROBBERS,In the hair of an Eastern girl
288,CHERRY ROBBERS,"Shine strings of crimson cherries, as if had bled"
289,CHERRY ROBBERS,Blood-drops beneath each curl.
290,CHERRY ROBBERS,
291,CHERRY ROBBERS,"Under the glistening cherries, with folded wings"
292,CHERRY ROBBERS,Three dead birds lie:
293,CHERRY ROBBERS,"Pale-breasted throstles and a blackbird, robberlings"
294,CHERRY ROBBERS,Stained with red dye.
295,CHERRY ROBBERS,
296,CHERRY ROBBERS,"Under the haystack a girl stands laughing at me,"
297,CHERRY ROBBERS,With cherries hung round her ears--
298,CHERRY ROBBERS,Offering me her scarlet fruit: I will see
299,CHERRY ROBBERS,If she has any tears.

307,I,I
308,I,
309,I,"Ah, you stack of white lilies, all white and gold,"
310,I,"I am adrift as a sunbeam, and without form"
311,I,"Or having, save I light on you to warm"
312,I,"Your pallor into radiance, flush your cold"
313,I,
314,I,White beauty into incandescence: you
315,I,"Are not a stack of white lilies to-night, but a white"
316,I,"And clustered star transfigured by me to-night,"
317,I,And lighting these ruddy leaves like a star dropped through
318,I,
319,I,"The slender bare arms of the branches, your tire-maidens"
320,I,Who lift swart arms to fend me off; but I come
321,I,"Like a wind of fire upon you, like to some"
322,I,Stray whitebeam who on you his fire unladens.
323,I,
324,I,And you are a glistening toadstool shining here
325,I,"Among the crumpled beech-leaves phosphorescent,"
326,I,My stack of white lilies burning incandescent
327,I,"Of me, a soft white star among the leaves, my dear."
328,I,
329,I,
330,II,II
331,II,
332,II,"Is it with pain, my dear, that you shudder so?"
333,II,"Is it because I have hurt you with pain, my dear?"
334,II,
335,II,"Did I shiver?--Nay, truly I did not know--"
336,II,A dewdrop may-be splashed on my face down here.
337,II,
338,II,Why even now you speak through close-shut teeth.
339,II,"I have been too much for you--Ah, I remember!"
340,II,
341,II,The ground is a little chilly underneath
342,II,"The leaves--and, dear, you consume me all to an ember."
343,II,
344,II,You hold yourself all hard as if my kisses
345,II,Hurt as I gave them--you put me away--
346,II,
347,II,Ah never I put you away: yet each kiss hisses
348,II,Hot as a drop of fire wastes me away.
349,II,
350,II,
351,III,III
352,III,
353,III,"I am ashamed, you wanted me not to-night--"
354,III,"Nay, it is always so, you sigh with me."
355,III,"Your radiance dims when I draw too near, and my free"
356,III,"Fire enters your petals like death, you wilt dead white."
357,III,
358,III,"Ah, I do know, and I am deep ashamed;"
359,III,You love me while I hover tenderly
360,III,Like clinging sunbeams kissing you: but see
361,III,"When I close in fire upon you, and you are flamed"
362,III,
363,III,"With the swiftest fire of my love, you are destroyed."
364,III,"'Tis a degradation deep to me, that my best"
365,III,Soul's whitest lightning which should bright attest
366,III,"God stepping down to earth in one white stride,"
367,III,
368,III,"Means only to you a clogged, numb burden of flesh"
369,III,"Heavy to bear, even heavy to uprear"
370,III,"Again from earth, like lilies wilted and sere"
371,III,"Flagged on the floor, that before stood up so fresh."
372,III,

377,COLDNESS IN LOVE,
378,COLDNESS IN LOVE,
379,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"And you remember, in the afternoon"
380,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"The sea and the sky went grey, as if there had sunk"
381,COLDNESS IN LOVE,A flocculent dust on the floor of the world: the festoon
382,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"Of the sky sagged dusty as spider cloth,"
383,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"And coldness clogged the sea, till it ceased to croon."
384,COLDNESS IN LOVE,
385,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"A dank, sickening scent came up from the grime"
386,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"Of weed that blackened the shore, so that I recoiled"
387,COLDNESS IN LOVE,Feeling the raw cold dun me: and all the time
388,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"You leapt about on the slippery rocks, and threw"
389,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"The words that rang with a brassy, shallow chime."
390,COLDNESS IN LOVE,
391,COLDNESS IN LOVE,And all day long that raw and ancient cold
392,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"Deadened me through, till the grey downs darkened to sleep."
393,COLDNESS IN LOVE,Then I longed for you with your mantle of love to fold
394,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"Me over, and drive from out of my body the deep"
395,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"Cold that had sunk to my soul, and there kept hold."
396,COLDNESS IN LOVE,
397,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"But still to me all evening long you were cold,"
398,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"And I was numb with a bitter, deathly ache;"
399,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"Till old days drew me back into their fold,"
400,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"And dim sheep crowded me warm with companionship,"
401,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"And old ghosts clustered me close, and sleep was cajoled."
402,COLDNESS IN LOVE,
403,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"I slept till dawn at the window blew in like dust,"
404,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"Like the linty, raw-cold dust disturbed from the floor"
405,COLDNESS IN LOVE,Of a disused room: a grey pale light like must
406,COLDNESS IN LOVE,That settled upon my face and hands till it seemed
407,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"To flourish there, as pale mould blooms on a crust."
408,COLDNESS IN LOVE,
409,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"Then I rose in fear, needing you fearfully,"
410,COLDNESS IN LOVE,For I thought you were warm as a sudden jet of blood.
411,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"I thought I could plunge in your spurting hotness, and be"
412,COLDNESS IN LOVE,Clean of the cold and the must.--With my hand on the latch
413,COLDNESS IN LOVE,I heard you in your sleep speak strangely to me.
414,COLDNESS IN LOVE,
415,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"And I dared not enter, feeling suddenly dismayed."
416,COLDNESS IN LOVE,So I went and washed my deadened flesh in the sea
417,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"And came back tingling clean, but worn and frayed"
418,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"With cold, like the shell of the moon: and strange it seems"
419,COLDNESS IN LOVE,"That my love has dawned in rose again, like the love of a maid."
420,COLDNESS IN LOVE,

431,I,"When will the scent of the dim, white phlox"
432,I,"Creep up the wall to me, and in at my open window?"
433,I,
434,I,"Why is it, the long slow stroke of the midnight bell,"
435,I,(Will it never finish the twelve?)
436,I,Falls again and again on my heart with a heavy reproach?
437,I,
438,I,"The moon-mist is over the village, out of the mist speaks the bell,"
439,I,"And all the little roofs of the village bow low, pitiful, beseeching,"
440,I,resigned:
441,I,"Oh, little home, what is it I have not done well?"
442,I,
443,I,"Ah home, suddenly I love you,"
444,I,"As I hear the sharp clean trot of a pony down the road,"
445,I,"Succeeding sharp little sounds dropping into the silence,"
446,I,Clear upon the long-drawn hoarseness of a train across the valley.
447,I,
448,I,The light has gone out from under my mother's door.
449,I,"That she should love me so,"
450,I,"She, so lonely, greying now,"
451,I,"And I leaving her,"
452,I,Bent on my pursuits!
453,I,
454,I,"Love is the great Asker,"
455,I,The sun and the rain do not ask the secret
456,I,
457,I,Of the time when the grain struggles down in the dark.
458,I,"The moon walks her lonely way without anguish,"
459,I,Because no loved one grieves over her departure.
460,I,
461,I,
462,II,II
463,II,
464,II,"Forever, ever by my shoulder pitiful Love will linger,"
465,II,Crouching as little houses crouch under the mist when I turn.
466,II,"Forever, out of the mist the church lifts up her reproachful finger,"
467,II,Pointing my eyes in wretched defiance where love hides her face to
468,II,mourn.
469,II,
470,II,Oh but the rain creeps down to wet the grain
471,II,"That struggles alone in the dark,"
472,II,"And asking nothing, cheerfully steals back again!"
473,II,The moon sets forth o' nights
474,II,"To walk the lonely, dusky heights"
475,II,"Serenely, with steps unswerving;"
476,II,"Pursued by no sigh of bereavement,"
477,II,No tears of love unnerving
478,II,Her constant tread:
479,II,"While ever at my side,"
480,II,"Frail and sad, with grey bowed head,"
481,II,"The beggar-woman, the yearning-eyed"
482,II,Inexorable love goes lagging.
483,II,
484,II,"The wild young heifer, glancing distraught,"
485,II,With a strange new knocking of life at her side
486,II,Runs seeking a loneliness.
487,II,The little grain draws down the earth to hide.
488,II,"Nay, even the slumberous egg, as it labours under the shell,"
489,II,"Patiently to divide, and self-divide,"
490,II,"Asks to be hidden, and wishes nothing to tell."
491,II,
492,II,"But when I draw the scanty cloak of silence over my eyes,"
493,II,Piteous Love comes peering under the hood.
494,II,"Touches the clasp with trembling fingers, and tries"
495,II,"To put her ear to the painful sob of my blood,"
496,II,"While her tears soak through to my breast,"
497,II,Where they burn and cauterise.
498,II,
499,II,
500,III,III
501,III,
502,III,The moon lies back and reddens.
503,III,"In the valley, a corncrake calls"
504,III,"Monotonously,"
505,III,"With a piteous, unalterable plaint, that deadens"
506,III,My confident activity:
507,III,"With a hoarse, insistent request that falls"
508,III,"Unweariedly, unweariedly,"
509,III,"Asking something more of me,"
510,III,Yet more of me!

517,REMINDER,
518,REMINDER,Do you remember
519,REMINDER,How night after night swept level and low
520,REMINDER,"Overhead, at home, and had not one star,"
521,REMINDER,Nor one narrow gate for the moon to go
522,REMINDER,Forth to her field of November.
523,REMINDER,
524,REMINDER,"And you remember,"
525,REMINDER,How towards the north a red blot on the sky
526,REMINDER,Burns like a blotch of anxiety
527,REMINDER,"Over the forges, and small flames ply"
528,REMINDER,Like ghosts the shadow of the ember.
529,REMINDER,
530,REMINDER,Those were the days
531,REMINDER,"When it was awful autumn to me,"
532,REMINDER,When only there glowed on the dark of the sky
533,REMINDER,"The red reflection of her agony,"
534,REMINDER,My beloved smelting down in the blaze
535,REMINDER,
536,REMINDER,Of death--my dearest
537,REMINDER,"Love who had borne, and was now leaving me."
538,REMINDER,And I at the foot of her cross did suffer
539,REMINDER,My own gethsemane.
540,REMINDER,
541,REMINDER,"So I came to you,"
542,REMINDER,"And twice, after great kisses, I saw"
543,REMINDER,The rim of the moon divinely rise
544,REMINDER,And strive to detach herself from the raw
545,REMINDER,Blackened edge of the skies.
546,REMINDER,
547,REMINDER,Strive to escape;
548,REMINDER,With her whiteness revealing my sunken world
549,REMINDER,Tall and loftily shadowed. But the moon
550,REMINDER,Never magnolia-like unfurled
551,REMINDER,"Her white, her lamp-like shape."
552,REMINDER,
553,REMINDER,"For you told me no,"
554,REMINDER,And bade me not to ask for the dour
555,REMINDER,"Communion, offering--""a better thing."""
556,REMINDER,So I lay on your breast for an obscure hour
557,REMINDER,Feeling your fingers go
558,REMINDER,
559,REMINDER,Like a rhythmic breeze
560,REMINDER,"Over my hair, and tracing my brows,"
561,REMINDER,Till I knew you not from a little wind:
562,REMINDER,--I wonder now if God allows
563,REMINDER,Us only one moment his keys.
564,REMINDER,
565,REMINDER,If only then
566,REMINDER,"You could have unlocked the moon on the night,"
567,REMINDER,And I baptized myself in the light
568,REMINDER,Of your love; we both have entered then the white
569,REMINDER,"Pure passion, and never again."
570,REMINDER,
571,REMINDER,I wonder if only
572,REMINDER,"You had taken me then, how different"
573,REMINDER,Life would have been: should I have spent
574,REMINDER,"Myself in waste, and you have bent"
575,REMINDER,"Your pride, through being lonely?"

618,LIGHTNING,And strange in my blood-swept ears was the sound
619,LIGHTNING,"Of the words I kept repeating,"
620,LIGHTNING,"Repeating with tightened arms, and the hot blood's blindfold art."
621,LIGHTNING,
622,LIGHTNING,"Her breath flew warm against my neck,"
623,LIGHTNING,Warm as a flame in the close night air;
624,LIGHTNING,And the sense of her clinging flesh was sweet
625,LIGHTNING,Where her arms and my neck's blood-surge could meet.
626,LIGHTNING,"Holding her thus, did I care"
627,LIGHTNING,"That the black night hid her from me, blotted out every speck?"
628,LIGHTNING,
629,LIGHTNING,"I leaned me forward to find her lips,"
630,LIGHTNING,"And claim her utterly in a kiss,"
631,LIGHTNING,"When the lightning flew across her face,"
632,LIGHTNING,And I saw her for the flaring space
633,LIGHTNING,"Of a second, afraid of the clips"
634,LIGHTNING,"Of my arms, inert with dread, wilted in fear of my kiss."
635,LIGHTNING,
636,LIGHTNING,"A moment, like a wavering spark,"
637,LIGHTNING,"Her face lay there before my breast,"
638,LIGHTNING,"Pale love lost in a snow of fear,"
639,LIGHTNING,"And guarded by a glittering tear,"
640,LIGHTNING,And lips apart with dumb cries;
641,LIGHTNING,"A moment, and she was taken again in the merciful dark."
642,LIGHTNING,
643,LIGHTNING,"I heard the thunder, and felt the rain,"
644,LIGHTNING,"And my arms fell loose, and I was dumb."
645,LIGHTNING,"Almost I hated her, she was so good,"
646,LIGHTNING,"Hated myself, and the place, and my blood,"

1673,I,Like floating froth on an ebbing shore in the moon.
1674,I,
1675,I,"Out of each star, dark, strange beams that disquiet:"
1676,I,"In the open depths of each flower, dark restless drops:"
1677,I,"Twin bubbles, shadow-full of mystery and challenge in the foam's"

1680,I,
1681,I,"The thick snow is crumpled on the roof, it plunges down"

1694,I,The rough snowball in the playground stands huge and still
1695,I,"With fair flakes settling down on it.--Beyond, the town"

1750,II,The old hard stem of my life
1751,II,That bears aloft towards rarer skies
1752,II,"My top of life, that buds on high"
1753,II,Amid the high wind's enterprise.
1754,II,They all do clothe my ungrowing life
1755,II,"With a rich, a thrilled young clasp of life;"
1756,II,"A clutch of attachment, like parenthood,"
1757,II,"Mounts up to my heart, and I find it good."
1758,II,
1759,II,"And I lift my head upon the troubled tangled world, and though the pain"
1760,II,"Of living my life were doubled, I still have this to comfort and"
1761,II,"sustain,"
1762,II,"I have such swarming sense of lives at the base of me, such sense of"
1763,II,lives
1764,II,"Clustering upon me, reaching up, as each after the other strives"
1765,II,To follow my life aloft to the fine wild air of life and the storm of
1766,II,"thought,"
1767,II,"And though I scarcely see the boys, or know that they are there,"
1768,II,distraught
1769,II,"As I am with living my life in earnestness, still progressively and"
1770,II,"alone,"
1771,II,"Though they cling, forgotten the most part, not companions, scarcely"
1772,II,known
1773,II,To me--yet still because of the sense of their closeness clinging
1774,II,"densely to me,"
1775,II,And slowly fingering up my stem and following all tinily
1776,II,"The way that I have gone and now am leading, they are dear to me."
1777,II,
1778,II,"They keep me assured, and when my soul feels lonely,"
1779,II,All mistrustful of thrusting its shoots where only
1780,II,"I alone am living, then it keeps"
1781,II,Me comforted to feel the warmth that creeps
1782,II,Up dimly from their striving; it heartens my strife:
1783,II,"And when my heart is chill with loneliness,"
1784,II,Then comforts it the creeping tenderness
1785,II,Of all the strays of life that climb my life.
