109,TO MY MOTHER,"Unuttered songs fly round my thoughts like birds,"
110,TO MY MOTHER,"And aerially, above an earth of words,"
111,TO MY MOTHER,Imagined music on my spirit showers
112,TO MY MOTHER,From azure-feathered throat and golden tongue.
113,TO MY MOTHER,
114,TO MY MOTHER,"Most dear, of the many songs I cannot sing"
115,TO MY MOTHER,Yours is the bird of heavenliest wing
116,TO MY MOTHER,Whose sunward flight beyond my following towers
117,TO MY MOTHER,And leaves me with an impotent harp unstrung.
118,TO MY MOTHER,
119,TO MY MOTHER,And yet the shadow of my song for you
120,TO MY MOTHER,"Falls on my heart forever as a dew,"
121,TO MY MOTHER,Or the dim-breathing soul of evening flowers
122,TO MY MOTHER,That love the delicate light of stars still young.
123,TO MY MOTHER,
124,TO MY MOTHER,These lesser songs that all who listen may hear
125,TO MY MOTHER,"Shall we call yours for a day, most dear, most dear?--"

127,TO MY MOTHER,"For ever singing, and for ever unsung."

140,I.,I.
141,I.,
142,I.,"They said it was a lone land, a land of many sorrows,"
143,I.,"Grey weeping waters and a strip of golden sand,"
144,I.,Loss and desolation and the washing out of footsteps
145,I.,That dare to treat the narrow golden peril of the sand.
146,I.,
147,I.,"They said it was a fire-land, a land of flaming passions,"
148,I.,"The sun like a molten rose in burning sapphire skies,"
149,I.,And never sound nor stir save of hearts that beat their way there
150,I.,Like southron birds whose wings seek the blue of burning skies.
151,I.,
152,I.,"But I have found a still land of neither pain nor passion,"
153,I.,"No loss because no giving there, no gain since no desire,"
154,I.,And the great silent light of the Belovèd's spirit brooding
155,I.,"With the soul of all time there, made empty of desire."
156,I.,
157,I.,
158,II,II
159,II,
160,II,Even as between the silence of the sea
161,II,And rounded silver miracle of the moon
162,II,A little dew is drawn upon the night
163,II,To dwell there like the image of a cloud:
164,II,
165,II,So from the silence of the darkest hour
166,II,The light that is a miracle in my soul
167,II,Distils the presence of the Well-Belov'd
168,II,And I possess the image in him of God.
169,II,
170,II,
171,III.,III.
172,III.,
173,III.,"I seem to walk as a shadow in Love's shadow,"
174,III.,I seem to have always known what love might be
175,III.,And beyond knowledge passed to the great tranquillity.
176,III.,
177,III.,"I seem to have gained the light without the longing,"
178,III.,For lo! even as the smoking rose-torch came
179,III.,"Within my hands, red flame turned smokeless silver flame."
180,III.,
181,III.,Now in my dreams I tread an asphodel meadow
182,III.,Where move the lovers out of the dreamful past.
183,III.,"""Dead lovers, how is it with you?"""
184,III.,
185,III.,"""It is well at last,"
186,III.,"Sister,"" reply their eyes about me thronging,"
187,III.,And all the phantoms of that immortal flight
188,III.,"Carry their torches still, and all the flames are white."
189,III.,
190,III.,
191,IV.,IV.
192,IV.,
193,IV.,"Often, so often, you walk in the cool dim thoughts of me,"
194,IV.,"Though you may never know how often and where,"
195,IV.,And a dream like a little lantern unknowing have given to me--
196,IV.,Between my two hands as I sit I hold it there
197,IV.,And never will let it again go out of the hands of me.
198,IV.,
199,IV.,For it may be that once you will let me wander the thoughts of you
200,IV.,"By a chance, for a moment, and then you will see me bear"
201,IV.,The fast-held lantern-light of the dream that was given by you
202,IV.,Since I never will let it go ... will you know? will you care
203,IV.,That the light I bear in my hands came out of the hands of you?
204,IV.,
205,IV.,
206,V.,V.
207,V.,
208,V.,If by the Messengers of Sleep
209,V.,I should be told that you had died
210,V.,I do not think that I would weep.--
211,V.,For you it only were to glide
212,V.,Out of the shallows into the deep;
213,V.,
214,V.,For me--how could such tidings shake
215,V.,"The thin clear crystal of my dream,"
216,V.,Mine past the breath of the earth to break?
217,V.,
218,V.,Till some bright breath from the Supreme
219,V.,"Keen-singing shatters it awake,"
220,V.,Whether you linger here or there
221,V.,"Still in the groves of trance I lean,"
222,V.,While on the hushed and heavenly air
223,V.,The moon of your spirit floats serene
224,V.,And makes my twilight softly fair.
225,V.,
226,V.,For from the shallows or the deep
227,V.,Beyond the ports of tranquil death
228,V.,I know some word of you will creep
229,V.,Nightly on the mysterious breath
230,V.,Of the white Messengers of Sleep.

295,440 B.C.,"(_Friday, September 24th, 1909_)"
296,440 B.C.,
297,440 B.C.,
298,440 B.C.,More than my sons that day my fathers were mighty within me!
299,440 B.C.,Walking the Past alone nothing I found there unknown.
300,440 B.C.,
301,440 B.C.,Time like a whirlwind blew where I stood by the Tree of the Ages:
302,440 B.C.,"Boughs that in years did abound scattered their burthen aground,"
303,440 B.C.,
304,440 B.C.,"Till in immense liberation divinely austere and familiar,"
305,440 B.C.,"Naked of over-ripe fruit, knew I the Stem and the Root."
306,440 B.C.,
307,440 B.C.,"Under the hand of the Sculptor, the carver of visible music,"
308,440 B.C.,"Felt I an infinite Truth, saw I immutable Youth."
309,440 B.C.,
310,440 B.C.,Out of the marble a sparkle of motion and delicate gesture
311,440 B.C.,Even as a rose unsheathed blossom-like started and breathed:
312,440 B.C.,
313,440 B.C.,"Even as animate light, a tremulous prism, made captive"
314,440 B.C.,Once in an æon whose spark leaps to us out of the dark.
315,440 B.C.,
316,440 B.C.,"Swift on a wonderful rapture upswung, the eternal procession"
317,440 B.C.,Joined I by some great right sharing the ages' delight.
318,440 B.C.,
319,440 B.C.,"Deathless singing there sounded and there moved life unarrested,"
320,440 B.C.,"I was the body and soul, I was the part and the whole."
321,440 B.C.,
322,440 B.C.,"I was that boy's fine strength restraining his quivering charger,"
323,440 B.C.,"Ay, and the nostril's fire quickened by curbèd desire."
324,440 B.C.,
325,440 B.C.,"I was this rhythmic strain of melodic, ineffable beauty"
326,440 B.C.,Maidenly garments reveal singing from shoulder to heel.
327,440 B.C.,
328,440 B.C.,"Well I remember how once when my sandal-latchet was loosened,"
329,440 B.C.,"While the procession delayed, stooping the knot I re-made."
330,440 B.C.,
331,440 B.C.,"Greater and less was I than the flower divinely unconscious,"
332,440 B.C.,Golden Youth flowing by scarce asking Whither and Why:
333,440 B.C.,
334,440 B.C.,"I was both seed and fruit of it: I was the beast sacrificial,"
335,440 B.C.,Garlanded ignorance led forth to be glorious dead:
336,440 B.C.,
337,440 B.C.,Also the elders within whose bosoms the torchlight of duty
338,440 B.C.,Mellowed by Service and Time burned in aloofness sublime:
339,440 B.C.,
340,440 B.C.,"More than these things! the thing they aspired to, the ultimate"
341,440 B.C.,"Godhead,"
342,440 B.C.,"Like a half-realised dream lifting to clasp the Supreme,"
343,440 B.C.,
344,440 B.C.,Crown and star of this Life-Stream endlessly singing and dancing

415,THE DANCE-RING,
416,THE DANCE-RING,It was the middle of the spring
417,THE DANCE-RING,I saw three girls dance in a ring.
418,THE DANCE-RING,
419,THE DANCE-RING,"One was golden as the day,"
420,THE DANCE-RING,Around her neck bright tresses lay.
421,THE DANCE-RING,
422,THE DANCE-RING,One as hazel-nuts was brown
423,THE DANCE-RING,And to her feet her hair fell down.

435,THE DANCE-RING,"Unkind sweetings, fare ye well."""
436,THE DANCE-RING,
437,THE DANCE-RING,Then each a mocking kiss did blow:

439,THE DANCE-RING,
440,THE DANCE-RING,"""You that the morning-glow outvie"
441,THE DANCE-RING,For all my gift shall take a sigh.

453,THE DANCE-RING,"""Broken-hearted gentleman."""
454,THE DANCE-RING,

744,CHILD'S VISION,His old hands shook with a sort of fear.
745,CHILD'S VISION,
746,CHILD'S VISION,He had a kind of twiggy broom
747,CHILD'S VISION,"As though he had a room to mind,"
748,CHILD'S VISION,Yet he was not in any room

761,CHILD'S VISION,"There were some feathers on the ground,"

765,CHILD'S VISION,
766,CHILD'S VISION,"I stood and watched and asked him why,"
767,CHILD'S VISION,But still he groped about the mold

770,CHILD'S VISION,
771,CHILD'S VISION,He got his broom and swept and swept

801,CHILD'S VISION,I think the old man must have known
802,CHILD'S VISION,"What smell it was, but would not say."
803,CHILD'S VISION,He shuffled slowly off alone
804,CHILD'S VISION,When summer all was burned away.
805,CHILD'S VISION,
806,CHILD'S VISION,One day when I'm a very old man
807,CHILD'S VISION,Perhaps I'll be as wise as he ...
808,CHILD'S VISION,"But I am not quite five, you know,"

813,MAN'S VISION,
814,MAN'S VISION,It was the longest August
815,MAN'S VISION,And the weariest September
816,MAN'S VISION,"That ever I remember,"
817,MAN'S VISION,That ever I remember!
818,MAN'S VISION,
819,MAN'S VISION,All the tedious summer
820,MAN'S VISION,I toiled among the city
821,MAN'S VISION,Where nothing fresh and sweet was
822,MAN'S VISION,Or cool or kind or pretty.
823,MAN'S VISION,
824,MAN'S VISION,"Empty all the streets were,"
825,MAN'S VISION,"Every house was lonely,"
826,MAN'S VISION,Nothing human moved there
827,MAN'S VISION,"Saving me, me only."
828,MAN'S VISION,
829,MAN'S VISION,"I saw little white things,"
830,MAN'S VISION,Things with dreadful faces--
831,MAN'S VISION,"No, they were not children"
832,MAN'S VISION,In the empty places.
833,MAN'S VISION,
834,MAN'S VISION,"Haggard, haggard tired things"
835,MAN'S VISION,Crossed my gaze and froze it--
836,MAN'S VISION,Men and women never
837,MAN'S VISION,"Looked so, and God knows it."
838,MAN'S VISION,
839,MAN'S VISION,"Somewhere, men and women--"
840,MAN'S VISION,"All the children, somewhere!"
841,MAN'S VISION,If I asked the heavens
842,MAN'S VISION,The heavens only dumb were.
843,MAN'S VISION,
844,MAN'S VISION,"Oh, the city pave-stones,"
845,MAN'S VISION,"Common, hard and dusty,"
846,MAN'S VISION,Like ignoble grave-stones
847,MAN'S VISION,Of high hopes gone rusty.
848,MAN'S VISION,
849,MAN'S VISION,"Oh, the arid, breathless"
850,MAN'S VISION,Days devoid of rumour.
851,MAN'S VISION,"Oh, the tedious, deathless,"
852,MAN'S VISION,"Hateful, humdrum summer ..."
853,MAN'S VISION,
854,MAN'S VISION,I walked out with a leaden brain
855,MAN'S VISION,And a heart half-wild--
856,MAN'S VISION,And suddenly I saw
857,MAN'S VISION,A Child.
858,MAN'S VISION,
859,MAN'S VISION,She had brown hands and brown bare knees
860,MAN'S VISION,And a glorious golden skin
861,MAN'S VISION,And eyes overlaid with sun on the sea
862,MAN'S VISION,And laughter's heart within.
863,MAN'S VISION,
864,MAN'S VISION,She stamped along the pavement
865,MAN'S VISION,"With hard and happy feet,"
866,MAN'S VISION,I was not done with gazing
867,MAN'S VISION,Till she out-raced the street.
868,MAN'S VISION,
869,MAN'S VISION,"A Child! One Child! But next day,"
870,MAN'S VISION,"Oh, next day there were _two_!"
871,MAN'S VISION,"And half-a-score to follow,"
872,MAN'S VISION,And so the legion grew.
873,MAN'S VISION,
874,MAN'S VISION,Children! Children! Children!
875,MAN'S VISION,"Come straight from where God is,"
876,MAN'S VISION,All the ocean's rhythm
877,MAN'S VISION,"Rocking in their bodies,"
878,MAN'S VISION,
879,MAN'S VISION,"All the sea-scent, field-scent"
880,MAN'S VISION,"Blowing from their tresses,"
881,MAN'S VISION,In their glad free glances
882,MAN'S VISION,"All that Earth expresses,"
883,MAN'S VISION,
884,MAN'S VISION,"Sun-kissed, wind-kissed,"
885,MAN'S VISION,"Rain-kissed bands,"
886,MAN'S VISION,"Sand-yellow, sturdy legs,"
887,MAN'S VISION,"Flower-dabbled hands,"
888,MAN'S VISION,
889,MAN'S VISION,"Eyes so shining, such loud voices,"
890,MAN'S VISION,"Such hard, happy feet!"
891,MAN'S VISION,Holiday-homing children
892,MAN'S VISION,Flowing through the street.
893,MAN'S VISION,
894,MAN'S VISION,Laughter's heart beat in
895,MAN'S VISION,The last week of September--
896,MAN'S VISION,The sweetest I remember!

916,NEW LIGHT,Like the last puff of incense that is seen
917,NEW LIGHT,"To vanish from the brazier, rose to cloak"
918,NEW LIGHT,The light until I feared it never had been.
919,NEW LIGHT,
920,NEW LIGHT,But now the crystal-clear white globe of peace

1081,EARTH AND THE WORLD,"And I can add no drop to His seas, no speck to His skies,"
1082,EARTH AND THE WORLD,I might yield myself to His shadow for ever on my eyes
1083,EARTH AND THE WORLD,"And the vision of Him for ever at peace in my peaceful soul,"
1084,EARTH AND THE WORLD,Till one still-breathing dusk when the West was a golden rose
1085,EARTH AND THE WORLD,I might float out on the tides and over the Brim

1329,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,
1330,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,When they stood of plumage bare

1332,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,When they stood of plumage bare
1333,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,Three white maidens rose up there.
1334,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,Earthly maids have not such rare

1341,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,These three maidens did begin
1342,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,"By the lakeside flax to spin,"
1343,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,And a low-hummed song did win
1344,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,"Thro' their threads all fine and thin,"
1345,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,"Stealing, flashing out and in."
1346,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,"(Was it magic, Wêland-Smith?)"
1347,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,
1348,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,When the golden flax was spun

1356,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,(Tense with hope lay Wêland-Smith.)

1359,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,"(Still your breathing, Wêland-Smith!)"
1360,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,From the sweet lake's flowering brim
1361,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,These three maids did dive and swim.
1362,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,"Oh, the flash of pearly limb"
1363,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,Visioned through the waters dim!

1387,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,"And their maidens came to land,"
1388,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,And the four passed down the strand.
1389,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,(Patient still was Wêland-Smith.)
1390,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,
1391,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,"Then the youngest of the brood,"
1392,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,"(Ay, and fairest, Wêland-Smith!)"
1393,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,Then the fairest of the brood
1394,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,Spoke to him from where she stood:

1396,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,"Spare my immortal maidenhood."""
1397,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,But the swan-girl's melting mood

1399,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,Every impulse of his blood
1400,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,Till desire was at full flood--
1401,WÊLAND AND THE SWAN-GIRLS,"('Ware of drowning, Wêland-Smith!)"
