51,AUTHOR’S NOTE,
52,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"The poems in this volume cover a period of three years, beginning at the"
53,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"New Year of 1920, except for the rhymes “Henry and Mary,” “What did I"
54,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"dream?” and “Mirror, Mirror!” with parts of “An English Wood,” “The Bed"
55,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"Post” and of “Unicorn and the White Doe,” which are bankrupt stock of"
56,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"1918, the year in which I was writing _Country Sentiment_. _The Pier"
57,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"Glass_, a volume which followed _Country Sentiment_, similarly contains"
58,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"a few pieces continuing the mood of this year, the desire to escape from"
59,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"a painful war neurosis into an Arcadia of amatory fancy, but the"
60,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"prevailing mood of _The Pier Glass_ is aggressive and disciplinary,"
61,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"under the stress of the same neurosis, rather than escapist."
62,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"_Whipperginny_ for a while continues so, but in most of the later pieces"
63,AUTHOR’S NOTE,will be found evidences of greater detachment in the poet and the
64,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"appearance of a new series of problems in religion, psychology and"
65,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"philosophy, no less exacting than their predecessors, but, it may be"
66,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"said, of less emotional intensity. The “Interlude” in the middle of the"
67,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"book was written before the appearance of these less lyrical pieces, but"
68,AUTHOR’S NOTE,must be read as an apology for the book being now even less homogeneous
69,AUTHOR’S NOTE,than before. To those who demand unceasing emotional stress in poetry at
70,AUTHOR’S NOTE,whatever cost to the poet--I was one of these myself until recently--I
71,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"have no apology to offer; but only this proverb from the Chinese, that"
72,AUTHOR’S NOTE,_the petulant protests of all the lords and ladies of the Imperial
73,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"Court will weigh little with the whale when, recovering from his painful"
74,AUTHOR’S NOTE,"excretory condition, he need no longer supply the Guild of Honourable"
75,AUTHOR’S NOTE,Perfumers with their accustomed weight of ambergris_.

813,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"Set the Bull prancing, the Snake wriggling;"
814,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"Where leaves were broadest and light dim,"
815,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,Fessé ambushed him.
816,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,
817,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,Up through the air I saw him swung
818,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,To bridal bowers with red flowers hung;
819,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,He choked for mercy like a maid
820,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,By his own violent whim betrayed;
821,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"Blood broke in fountains from his neck,"
822,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"I heard his hugged ribs creak and break,"
823,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,But what the tree-top rites might be
824,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,How should I stay to see?
825,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,
826,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,In terror of the Ape God’s power
827,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"I changed my person in that hour,"
828,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"Cast off the livery of my clan,"
829,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"Over unlawful hills I ran,"
830,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,I soiled me with forbidden earth.
831,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,In nakedness of second birth
832,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,I scorched away the Snake’s red eyes
833,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"Tattoed for name about my thighs,"
834,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,And slew the Sacred Bull oppressed
835,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,With passion on my breast.
836,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,
837,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"The girls of my new tribe are cold,"
838,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"Amazon, scarred, not soft to hold."
839,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"They seek not men, nor are they sought,"
840,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"Whose children are not theirs, but bought"
841,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,From outlaw tribes who dwell in trees--
842,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,Tamed apes suckle these.
843,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,
844,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,The young men of the tribe are such
845,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"That knife or bow they dare not touch,"
846,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,But in close watching of the skies
847,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,And reckoning counts they dim their eyes.
848,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"Closed, each by each, in thoughtful bars"
849,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"They plot the circuits of the stars,"
850,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,And frozen music dulls their need
851,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,Of drink and man-flesh greed.
852,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,
853,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,They hold that virtue from them slips
854,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,When eye greets eye or lips touch lips;
855,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,Down to the knee their broad beards fall
856,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,And hardly are they men at all.
857,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"Possessions they have none, nor schools"
858,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"For tribal duties, nor close rules,"
859,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"No gods, no rites, no totem beasts,"
860,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"No friendships, no love feasts."
861,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,
862,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"Now quit, as they, of gong-roused lust,"
863,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"The leap of breasts, the scattering dust,"
864,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,In hermit splendour at my glass
865,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"I watch the skies’ procession pass,"
866,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,Tracing my figures on the floor
867,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,Of planets’ paths and comets’ lore;
868,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"In calm amaze I cloak my will,"
869,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"I gaze, I count, until"
870,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,
871,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"Harsh from his House the Bull roars out,"
872,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"Forked lightning leaps his points about,"
873,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,Tattoos his shape upon the sky:
874,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,Night anger fills the Serpent’s eye
875,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,With desolating fire for one
876,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,"Who thought the Serpent’s days were done,"
877,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,And girlish titterings from the trees
878,THE SNAKE AND THE BULL,Loosen my firm knees.

884,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,
885,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,
886,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,As I stood by the stair-head in the upper hall
887,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,The rooms to left and right were locked as before.
888,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,It was senseless to hammer at an unreal door
889,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,Painted on the plaster of a ten-foot wall.
890,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,
891,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"There was half-light here, piled darkness beyond"
892,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"Rising up sheer as the mountain of Time,"
893,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"The blank rock-face that no thought can climb,"
894,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,Girdled around with the Slough of Despond.
895,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,
896,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"I stood quite dumb, sunk fast in the mire,"
897,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"Lonely as the first man, or the last man,"
898,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"Chilled to despair since evening began,"
899,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,Dazed for the memory of a lost desire.
900,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,
901,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"But a voice said “Easily,” and a voice said “Come!”"
902,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"Easily I followed with no thought of doubt,"
903,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"Turned to the right hand, and the way stretched out;"
904,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,The ground held firmly; I was no more dumb.
905,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,
906,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"For that was the place where I longed to be,"
907,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"And past all hope there the kind lamp shone,"
908,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"The carpet was holy that my feet were on,"
909,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,And logs on the fire lay hissing for me.
910,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,
911,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"The cushions were friendship and the chairs were love,"
912,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"Shaggy with love was the great wolf skin,"
913,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"The clock ticked “Easily” as I entered in,"
914,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"“Come,” called the bullfinch from his cage above."
915,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,
916,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,Love went before me; it was shining now
917,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"From the eyes of a girl by the window wall,"
918,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,Whose beauty I knew to be fate and all
919,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,By the thin red ribbon on her calm brow.
920,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,
921,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,Then I was a hero and a bold boy
922,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,Kissing the hand I had never yet kissed;
923,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,I felt red ribbon like a snake twist
924,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"In my own thick hair, so I laughed for joy."
925,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,
926,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,*       *       *       *       *
927,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,

929,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,The rooms to the left and right are locked as before.
930,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,"Once I found entrance, but now never more,"
931,THE RED RIBBON DREAM,And Time leans forward with his glassy wall.

1554,THE SEWING BASKET,"Demand that she,"
1555,THE SEWING BASKET,"If ever wanting help from me,"

1564,THE SEWING BASKET,To review
1565,THE SEWING BASKET,And search this basket through.
1566,THE SEWING BASKET,
1567,THE SEWING BASKET,Here’s one place full
1568,THE SEWING BASKET,"Of coloured wool,"
1569,THE SEWING BASKET,And various yarn

1571,THE SEWING BASKET,"A sampler, too,"
1572,THE SEWING BASKET,"I’ve worked for you,"

1581,THE SEWING BASKET,For his ingenuous face;
1582,THE SEWING BASKET,Be sure I’ve not forgotten
1583,THE SEWING BASKET,Black thread or crochet cotton;
1584,THE SEWING BASKET,While Brussels lace
1585,THE SEWING BASKET,Has found a place
1586,THE SEWING BASKET,Behind the needle-case.
1587,THE SEWING BASKET,(But the case for the scissors?
1588,THE SEWING BASKET,"Empty, as you see;"

1601,THE SEWING BASKET,Benjamin’s song
1602,THE SEWING BASKET,"He sings all day long,"
1603,THE SEWING BASKET,Though his voice is not strong:
1604,THE SEWING BASKET,He hoarsely holloas
1605,THE SEWING BASKET,More or less as follows:--
1606,THE SEWING BASKET,
1607,THE SEWING BASKET,_Button boxes
1608,THE SEWING BASKET,"Never have locks-es,"
1609,THE SEWING BASKET,For the keys would soon disappear.
1610,THE SEWING BASKET,But here’s a linen button
1611,THE SEWING BASKET,"With a smut on,"
1612,THE SEWING BASKET,And a big bone button
1613,THE SEWING BASKET,"With a cut on,"
1614,THE SEWING BASKET,A pearly and a fancy
1615,THE SEWING BASKET,"Of small significancy,"
1616,THE SEWING BASKET,And the badges of a Fireman and a Fusilier._
1617,THE SEWING BASKET,Which song he’ll alternate
1618,THE SEWING BASKET,With sounds like a Turkish hubble-bubble
1619,THE SEWING BASKET,"Smoked at a furious rate,"
1620,THE SEWING BASKET,The words are scarcely intelligible:--
1621,THE SEWING BASKET,
1622,THE SEWING BASKET,"(_Prestissimo_) _Needles and ribbons and packets of pins,"
1623,THE SEWING BASKET,"Prints and chintz and odd bodikins,"
1624,THE SEWING BASKET,They’d never mind whether
1625,THE SEWING BASKET,You laid ’em together
1626,THE SEWING BASKET,Or one from the other in pockets and tins._
1627,THE SEWING BASKET,
1628,THE SEWING BASKET,_For packets of pins and ribbons and needles
1629,THE SEWING BASKET,"Or odd bodikins and chintz and prints,"
1630,THE SEWING BASKET,Being birds of a feather.
1631,THE SEWING BASKET,Would huddle together
1632,THE SEWING BASKET,Like minnows on billows or pennies in mints._
1633,THE SEWING BASKET,
1634,THE SEWING BASKET,He’ll learn to sing more prettily
1635,THE SEWING BASKET,When you take him out to Italy
1636,THE SEWING BASKET,"On your honeymoon,"
1637,THE SEWING BASKET,(Oh come back soon!)
1638,THE SEWING BASKET,"To Florence or to Rome,"
1639,THE SEWING BASKET,"The _prima donnas’_ home,"
1640,THE SEWING BASKET,To Padua or to Genoa
1641,THE SEWING BASKET,Where tenors all sing tra-la-la....
1642,THE SEWING BASKET,
1643,THE SEWING BASKET,"Good-bye, Winifred,"
