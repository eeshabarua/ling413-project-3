195,THE BROOK ALONG THE ROMSEY ROAD,On the far shore a wag-tail dipped
196,THE BROOK ALONG THE ROMSEY ROAD,"His beak,—we gazed below,"

2100,A STORY FOR A CHILD,A STORY FOR A CHILD
2101,A STORY FOR A CHILD,
2102,I,I
2103,I,
2104,I,"An old white Jocko, kindly and urbane,"
2105,I,"Lived with a little girl called Betsey-Jane,"
2106,I,"He was her oldest friend, thin was his hair,"
2107,I,"One arm he lacked, but Jocko did not care,"
2108,I,"No more did Betsey-Jane;—his eyes were gone,"
2109,I,"His figure flat, but all his teeth were on,"
2110,I,"Stitched to his mouth, a row of beady pearls"
2111,I,More white than those of many little girls.
2112,I,All day to please he did his docile best
2113,I,And only squeaked when Betsey punched his chest;
2114,I,"When bed-time came and Nurse tucked Betsey in,"
2115,I,Warm in her cot he slept beneath her chin.
2116,I,
2117,II,II
2118,II,
2119,II,Now Betsey-Jane was rather more than two
2120,II,And just about as good as I and you;—
2121,II,"She’d learnt to talk, but not learnt when to stop,"
2122,II,"Her yellow hair swung round her in a mop,"
2123,II,"Round was her face, her eyes were opened wide"
2124,II,And only blinked in sleep or when she cried;
2125,II,White frocks she had and blue her pinafore
2126,II,"With scarlet stitching at the neck, and more"
2127,II,"Delights she had than many girls and boys,—"
2128,II,"Father and Mother, Nurse and many toys"
2129,II,"To comfort her, but, more than all the rest,"
2130,II,There is no doubt she loved her Jocko best.
2131,II,
2132,III,III
2133,III,
2134,III,"Yet Jocko’s life was not a life of ease,—"
2135,III,"We think to do entirely as we please,"
2136,III,Age teaches otherwise. One evil day
2137,III,A cat approached the cushion where he lay
2138,III,And tore away his inoffensive hair
2139,III,"And left him with his leathern skin laid bare,"
2140,III,Silent upon the rug. His Betsey-Jane
2141,III,Found him with tears and kissed him well again;
2142,III,"But she herself, forgetful of her grief,"
2143,III,Laughed when they dressed him in a handkerchief
2144,III,"Just like a doll, but Jocko did not mind,"
2145,III,He still forgave her for his heart was kind.
2146,III,
2147,IV,IV
2148,IV,
2149,IV,"Thus did our Jocko play, for Betsey’s sake,"
2150,IV,"The Grand Domestic Game of Give and Take,"
2151,IV,Until her rudeness to her friend was such
2152,IV,As makes men say “This is a straw too much.”
2153,IV,"One day he sat, as docile as a lamb,"
2154,IV,"By Betsey-Jane who, upright in her pram,"
2155,IV,"Refused to sleep and went from bad to worse,"
2156,IV,Kicked off her rug and disobeyed her nurse;
2157,IV,And though her Jocko did not speak his mind
2158,IV,"And only stared to see her so unkind,"
2159,IV,"In Endless Street, some yards from their abode,"
2160,IV,She picked him up and flung him in the road.
2161,IV,
2162,V,V
2163,V,
2164,V,On sped the pram nor did the nurse’s pace
2165,V,Leave time to miss our hero from his place.
2166,V,"Flat by the curb lay Jocko, still and pale,"
2167,V,Till a rude sparrow plucked him by the tail
2168,V,And up he sat;—the sparrow hopped around
2169,V,"And eyed him seated sadly on the ground,"
2170,V,Propped up against the parapet and grey
2171,V,With grime and dust that in the gutter lay.
2172,V,"Then Jocko spoke, he smoothed his sullied fur"
2173,V,"With one long trembling paw, and thought of her"
2174,V,"And said, all torn betwixt his love and pain,—"
2175,V,“I will go back no more to Betsey-Jane.”
2176,V,
2177,VI,VI
2178,VI,
2179,VI,“I will arise and go beyond the din
2180,VI,"Of towns to where the endless woods begin,"
2181,VI,There among tangled oaks and lowly ways
2182,VI,Of undergrowth to end my dreary days;
2183,VI,"I will seek acorns, beech-nuts, hips and haws"
2184,VI,And pluck them down with my prehensile paws;
2185,VI,"While the grey rabbits, never shy with me,"
2186,VI,From holes around my sandy-rooted tree
2187,VI,"Come out to nibble in the gentle rain,—"
2188,VI,A calmer life than that with Betsey-Jane.
2189,VI,"Long is the way, but I will make a start,"
2190,VI,A carrier shall take me in his cart.”
2191,VI,
2192,VII,VII
2193,VII,
2194,VII,"This said, he rose, and sought with feeble pace,"
2195,VII,"For he was stiff and sore, the Market Place;"
2196,VII,"Where, without horses and their shafts turned down,"
2197,VII,Are ranged the carts that come into the town;
2198,VII,"Until at dusk, all loaded up, they’re gone."
2199,VII,He found the cart that went to Clarendon.
2200,VII,Beneath it lay a yellow dog who shook
2201,VII,"His brazen collar, but his churlish look"
2202,VII,Passed off when Jocko hailed the man inside
2203,VII,"Who, loading parcels and not looking, cried,—"
2204,VII,"“We start in Butcher Row, sir, from the Bear."
2205,VII,At four o’clock.” Said Jocko “I’ll be there.”
2206,VII,
2207,VIII,VIII
2208,VIII,
2209,VIII,"All was arranged, and he could do no more"
2210,VIII,But pass the time until the clock struck four.
2211,VIII,He wandered up the Market; far and wide
2212,VIII,"The burly drovers elbowed him aside,"
2213,VIII,The sheep regarded him with mild surprise
2214,VIII,"Behind their hurdles, and the hairy eyes"
2215,VIII,Of families of little porkers stared
2216,VIII,And cart-horses with braided tresses glared
2217,VIII,And stamped upon the cobbles. From their shed
2218,VIII,The calves looked bluntly round and many a head
2219,VIII,"Of penned-up fowls peered through a wiry door,—"
2220,VIII,"“Jocko!” they cackled, “we will meet once more!”"
2221,VIII,
2222,IX,IX
2223,IX,
2224,IX,Out of the Market Place an alley led
2225,IX,To Poultry Cross and old white Jocko sped
2226,IX,Beneath its shelter and surveyed the stalls
2227,IX,"Which here sell hobby horse, tops and balls,"
2228,IX,And tins for little cakes. One stall was full
2229,IX,"Of button-cards and reels and hanks of wool,"
2230,IX,"Another sold you sage and pansy roots,"
2231,IX,"And this, red carpet-slippers, hob-nailed boots"
2232,IX,"And clogs, and hanging on a string by twos"
2233,IX,A row of little russet leather shoes;
2234,IX,"Tears filled his eyes, he turned to look again,—"
2235,IX,"“Those shoes,” said he, “are just like Betsey-Jane.”"
2236,IX,
2237,X,X
2238,X,
2239,X,While thus he spake two farmers sauntered past
2240,X,"And turned to stare at Jocko, said the last,—"
2241,X,"“I saw that monkey next a Spanish hen,"
2242,X,The little beast has wandered from his pen!”
2243,X,"Jocko is captured by the portly pair,"
2244,X,"They lead him, passive, to the Market Square;"
2245,X,"Once more the hens their throats exultant crane,—"
2246,X,“Jocko!” they cackle; “Here he is again!”
2247,X,"The farmers stuff our hero, sad and sore,"
2248,X,Into a vacant pen and slam the door:—
2249,X,Through the grim wires the searching breezes moan
2250,X,And Jocko sits there shivering alone.
2251,X,
2252,XI,XI
2253,XI,
2254,XI,The time lagged on; some children through his door
2255,XI,"Prodded his fur with sticks, the clock struck four."
2256,XI,"Now is the time, but Jocko does not care,"
2257,XI,When carriers are starting from the Bear;
2258,XI,"Fast in his pen, and all his anger gone,"
2259,XI,No longer would he live at Clarendon.
2260,XI,"Home was his one desire. “At six,” he said,"
2261,XI,"“My Betsey-Jane is kissed, and goes to bed,"
2262,XI,"Her bath-tub by the nursery fire will be,"
2263,XI,She will come in and look around for me
2264,XI,And sob all night beneath her counterpane
2265,XI,For her lost Jocko—little Betsey-Jane!”
2266,XI,
2267,XII,XII
2268,XII,
2269,XII,"While Jocko thus lamented, through the crowd"
2270,XII,There came a little girl who sobbed aloud
2271,XII,"And clutched her Mother’s hand; ’twas Betsey-Jane,"
2272,XII,Who all the afternoon had sought in vain
2273,XII,Her Jocko cast away in Endless Street;
2274,XII,"Tired are her little gaitered legs, her feet"
2275,XII,"So weary, each new thought of Jocko brings"
2276,XII,New tears to wet her woollen bonnet strings
2277,XII,And drip from each blue tassel to the ground.
2278,XII,"She would not look on all the beasts around,"
2279,XII,"But Jocko saw her coat, and “Betsey-Jane,”"
2280,XII,"He cried, “Do come and take me home again!”"
2281,XII,
2282,XIII,XIII
2283,XIII,
2284,XIII,"Alas, they did not hear, his voice was low,"
2285,XIII,"With chill and hunger, Mother turned to go;"
2286,XIII,But Betsey-Jane looked sadly back and then
2287,XIII,Beheld him upright in his distant pen.
2288,XIII,She dropped her Mother’s hand and with a shout
2289,XIII,"Of “Jocko, Jocko!” ran to get him out;—"
2290,XIII,Two shame-faced men undid at her commands
2291,XIII,"His cage and Mother put him in her hands,"
2292,XIII,"She clasped him closely, not a word was said,"
2293,XIII,And laid her tearful cheek against his head.
2294,XIII,
2295,XIV,XIV
2296,XIV,
2297,XIV,So back to Endless Street and once again
2298,XIV,"Our Jocko slumbers close to Betsey-Jane,"
2299,XIV,"Clutched in her little fingers’ rosy snare,"
2300,XIV,"Among the sleepy tangles of her hair,"
2301,XIV,Seen dimly through her cot’s surrounding rail.
2302,XIV,And here are morals tied to Jocko’s Tale:—
2303,XIV,“Though hurt your feelings never try to roam
2304,XIV,For there are many places worse than home.”
2305,XIV,"And yet another,—“Never slight or spurn"
2306,XIV,"A good old friend, they say a worm will turn;"
2307,XIV,And such-like stories end in deeper pain
2308,XIV,Than that of Jocko and his Betsey-Jane.”

2442,THE BABY GOAT,Wherewith the desolate green waste
2443,THE BABY GOAT,O’erloads his heart who at the edge
2444,THE BABY GOAT,Of stagnant waters kneels to taste
2445,THE BABY GOAT,The thankless sedge.

2447,THE BABY GOAT,His Mother is his chiefest lack
2448,THE BABY GOAT,Who in some heathy upland place
2449,THE BABY GOAT,Tidied his sturdy socks of black
2450,THE BABY GOAT,And licked his face;
2451,THE BABY GOAT,He turns to see us saunter by

2799,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"Plena ipso.”—_Juvenal_, I. 30.]"
2800,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,
2801,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"When Sir Matho lay a-dying and his feet were growing cold,"
2802,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"For the fire was out and left the place in gloom,"
2803,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,And he could not see the night-light on his cornices of gold
2804,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,And the nurses that were hired for him some grisly gossip told
2805,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"As they lingered in the little dressing-room,"
2806,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,There was none to light him candles or to kneel by him and pray
2807,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,And the youth that fed the fire-dogs had packed up and gone away—
2808,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,For where’s the sense of waiting on a man whose days are done?
2809,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,_And the faggots lie a-rotting where the brown pheasants run._
2810,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,
2811,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"As Sir Matho lay a-shivering, for Death crept on apace,"
2812,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,Came an agèd woman in the flickering light;
2813,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"Like the women of the village, but he didn’t know her face,"
2814,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,For his 50-h.p. Panhard used to go at such a pace
2815,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,That he never knew his cottagers by sight.
2816,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,He saw her twist her apron in her ugly withered hands
2817,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"As the poor did who awaited, while he lived, his high commands"
2818,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,And Sir Matho blinked upon her like an old dog in the sun.
2819,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,_And the faggots lie a-rotting where the brown pheasants run._
2820,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,
2821,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,Then Sir Matho saw she looked on him and waited his desire
2822,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,And he conjured the poor mis-shapen witch
2823,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"To bring some logs of cedar and of oak to light his fire,"
2824,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,For he counted on the pity that is never had for hire
2825,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,And is all the poor possess to give the rich.
2826,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"But she wrung her hands and cried to him, “Ah, Sir, I’ve done"
2827,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,the oil
2828,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,Wherewith upon a little stove my mess of greens I boil;
2829,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"And coal is dear, and very dear, and fuel have we none.”"
2830,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,_And the faggots lie a-rotting where the brown pheasants run._
2831,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,
2832,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"She knelt her at his couch’s foot, he saw her sorrow rise,"
2833,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"Her tears bestarred his fair embroidered sheet,"
2834,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"She pierced his silken coverlid with pity of her eyes,"
2835,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"Her tenderness descended, like the dews of Paradise"
2836,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"Or grace of shining chrism, upon his feet—"
2837,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,The feet that trod the russet woods and broke the bracken curls;
2838,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"And crushed the purple whinberries, that grow for little girls,"
2839,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,When the silly foreign feathers fell a-screaming to his gun.
2840,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,_And the faggots lie a-rotting where the brown pheasants run._
2841,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,
2842,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"And her tears recalled Sir Matho to a Woman ’neath a Tree,"
2843,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,’Twas an old pietà in his hall below
2844,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,(Bought to pass the time at Christie’s for a song) wherein you see
2845,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"How a Mother holds the Body of her Son upon her knee,"
2846,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,But her eyes are red for them that dealt the blow.
2847,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,"“This woman has forgiven me, and You forgive,” he cried."
2848,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,“So He may still be merciful.” With that Sir Matho died.
2849,THE DEATH OF SIR MATHO,But Satan ceased to blow the fire that he had well begun.
