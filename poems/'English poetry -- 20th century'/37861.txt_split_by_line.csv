42,PREFACE,
43,PREFACE,"Three years ago I published a volume called _Poems: First Series_,"
44,PREFACE,which contained a collection of what I had written between 1905 and
45,PREFACE,"March, 1918."
46,PREFACE,
47,PREFACE,The present collection contains all that I have written since then.
48,PREFACE,_The Birds_ and nine shorter poems were published in a small booklet in
49,PREFACE,1919; _The Moon_ was separately published in 1920; but the majority of
50,PREFACE,"the poems here printed appear in book form for the first time, and"
51,PREFACE,twelve have never previously been published.
52,PREFACE,
53,PREFACE,"The poems are as nearly as possible in chronological order, except that"
54,PREFACE,the group called _An Epilogue_ should have been dated 1917.

111,THE BIRDS,
112,THE BIRDS,(_To Edmund Gosse_)
113,THE BIRDS,
114,THE BIRDS,"Within mankind's duration, so they say,"
115,THE BIRDS,Khephren and Ninus lived but yesterday.
116,THE BIRDS,Asia had no name till man was old
117,THE BIRDS,And long had learned the use of iron and gold;
118,THE BIRDS,"And æons had passed, when the first corn was planted,"
119,THE BIRDS,Since first the use of syllables was granted.
120,THE BIRDS,
121,THE BIRDS,"Men were on earth while climates slowly swung,"
122,THE BIRDS,"Fanning wide zones to heat and cold, and long"
123,THE BIRDS,"Subsidence turned great continents to sea,"
124,THE BIRDS,"And seas dried up, dried up interminably,"
125,THE BIRDS,Age after age; enormous seas were dried
126,THE BIRDS,Amid wastes of land.  And the last monsters died.
127,THE BIRDS,
128,THE BIRDS,Earth wore another face.  O since that prime
129,THE BIRDS,Man with how many works has sprinkled time!
130,THE BIRDS,"Hammering, hewing, digging tunnels, roads;"
131,THE BIRDS,"Building ships, temples, multiform abodes."
132,THE BIRDS,"How, for his body's appetites, his toils"
133,THE BIRDS,"Have conquered all earth's products, all her soils;"
134,THE BIRDS,And in what thousand thousand shapes of art
135,THE BIRDS,He has tried to find a language for his heart!
136,THE BIRDS,
137,THE BIRDS,"Never at rest, never content or tired:"
138,THE BIRDS,"Insatiate wanderer, marvellously fired,"
139,THE BIRDS,Most grandly piling and piling into the air
140,THE BIRDS,Stones that will topple or arch he knows not where.
141,THE BIRDS,"And yet did I, this spring, think it more strange,"
142,THE BIRDS,"More grand, more full of awe, than all that change,"
143,THE BIRDS,"And lovely and sweet and touching unto tears,"
144,THE BIRDS,"That through man's chronicled and unchronicled years,"
145,THE BIRDS,And even into that unguessable beyond
146,THE BIRDS,"The water-hen has nested by a pond,"
147,THE BIRDS,"Weaving dry flags into a beaten floor,"
148,THE BIRDS,The one sure product of her only lore.
149,THE BIRDS,Low on a ledge above the shadowed water
150,THE BIRDS,"Then, when she heard no men, as nature taught her,"
151,THE BIRDS,Flashing around with busy scarlet bill
152,THE BIRDS,"She built that nest, her nest, and builds it still."
153,THE BIRDS,
154,THE BIRDS,O let your strong imagination turn
155,THE BIRDS,"The great wheel backward, until Troy unburn,"
156,THE BIRDS,"And then unbuild, and seven Troys below"
157,THE BIRDS,"Rise out of death, and dwindle, and outflow,"
158,THE BIRDS,"Till all have passed, and none has yet been there:"
159,THE BIRDS,"Back, ever back.  Our birds still crossed the air;"
160,THE BIRDS,Beyond our myriad changing generations
161,THE BIRDS,"Still built, unchanged, their known inhabitations."
162,THE BIRDS,A million years before Atlantis was
163,THE BIRDS,"Our lark sprang from some hollow in the grass,"
164,THE BIRDS,Some old soft hoof-print in a tussock's shade;
165,THE BIRDS,"And the wood-pigeon's smooth snow-white eggs were laid,"
166,THE BIRDS,"High amid green pines' sunset-coloured shafts,"
167,THE BIRDS,And rooks their villages of twiggy rafts
168,THE BIRDS,"Set on the tops of elms, where elms grew then,"
169,THE BIRDS,And still the thumbling tit and perky wren
170,THE BIRDS,Popped through the tiny doors of cosy balls
171,THE BIRDS,And the blackbird lined with moss his high-built walls;
172,THE BIRDS,"A round mud cottage held the thrush's young,"
173,THE BIRDS,And straws from the untidy sparrow's hung.
174,THE BIRDS,"And, skimming forktailed in the evening air,"
175,THE BIRDS,When man first was were not the martins there?
176,THE BIRDS,"Did not those birds some human shelter crave,"
177,THE BIRDS,And stow beneath the cornice of his cave
178,THE BIRDS,Their dry tight cups of clay?  And from each door
179,THE BIRDS,Peeped on a morning wiseheads three or four.
180,THE BIRDS,
181,THE BIRDS,"Yes, daw and owl, curlew and crested hern,"
182,THE BIRDS,"Kingfisher, mallard, water-rail and tern,"
183,THE BIRDS,"Chaffinch and greenfinch, wagtail, stonechat, ruff,"
184,THE BIRDS,"Whitethroat and robin, fly-catcher and chough,"
185,THE BIRDS,"Missel-thrush, magpie, sparrow-hawk and jay,"
186,THE BIRDS,"Built, those far ages gone, in this year's way."
187,THE BIRDS,"And the first man who walked the cliffs of Rame,"
188,THE BIRDS,"As I this year, looked down and saw the same"
189,THE BIRDS,Blotches of rusty red on ledge and cleft
190,THE BIRDS,"With grey-green spots on them, while right and left"
191,THE BIRDS,"A dizzying tangle of gulls were floating and flying,"
192,THE BIRDS,"Wheeling and crossing and darting, crying and crying,"
193,THE BIRDS,"Circling and crying, over and over and over,"
194,THE BIRDS,Crying with swoop and hover and fall and recover.
195,THE BIRDS,"And below on a rock against the grey sea fretted,"
196,THE BIRDS,"Pipe-necked and stationary and silhouetted,"
197,THE BIRDS,"Cormorants stood in a wise, black, equal row"
198,THE BIRDS,Above the nests and long blue eggs we know.
199,THE BIRDS,
200,THE BIRDS,"O delicate chain over all the ages stretched,"
201,THE BIRDS,O dumb tradition from what far darkness fetched:
202,THE BIRDS,Each little architect with its one design
203,THE BIRDS,"Perpetual, fixed and right in stuff and line,"
204,THE BIRDS,"Each little ministrant who knows one thing,"
205,THE BIRDS,One learnèd rite to celebrate the spring.
206,THE BIRDS,"Whatever alters else on sea or shore,"
207,THE BIRDS,These are unchanging: man must still explore.

212,A DOG'S DEATH,A DOG'S DEATH
213,A DOG'S DEATH,
214,A DOG'S DEATH,The loose earth falls in the grave like a peaceful regular breathing;
215,A DOG'S DEATH,"Too like, for I was deceived a moment by the sound:"
216,A DOG'S DEATH,It has covered the heap of bracken that the gardener laid above him;
217,A DOG'S DEATH,Quiet the spade swings: there we have now his mound.
218,A DOG'S DEATH,
219,A DOG'S DEATH,A patch of fresh earth on the floor of the wood's renewing chamber:
220,A DOG'S DEATH,All around is grass and moss and the hyacinth's dark green sprouts:
221,A DOG'S DEATH,And oaks are above that were old when his fiftieth sire was a puppy:
222,A DOG'S DEATH,And far away in the garden I hear the children's shouts.
223,A DOG'S DEATH,
224,A DOG'S DEATH,Their joy is remote as a dream.  It is strange how we buy our sorrow
225,A DOG'S DEATH,"For the touch of perishing things, idly, with open eyes;"
226,A DOG'S DEATH,"How we give our hearts to brutes that will die in a few seasons,"
227,A DOG'S DEATH,Nor trouble what we do when we do it; nor would have it otherwise.

238,A POET TO HIS MUSE,"Long ago I knew that brown integument,"
239,A POET TO HIS MUSE,"Like a dead husk, had dormant life within it,"
240,A POET TO HIS MUSE,And waited till a first white point appeared
241,A POET TO HIS MUSE,Which shot into a naked stiff pale spike
242,A POET TO HIS MUSE,That grew.
243,A POET TO HIS MUSE,I knew this was not all;
244,A POET TO HIS MUSE,"Nothing I said as greener you grew and taller,"
245,A POET TO HIS MUSE,"But dreamed alone of the day when your bud would unsheathe,"
246,A POET TO HIS MUSE,"And silently swell, and at last your crown would break"
247,A POET TO HIS MUSE,"Filling the air with clouds of colour and fragrance,"
248,A POET TO HIS MUSE,"Radiant waves, odours of immortality."

253,A POET TO HIS MUSE,Breaking the clods and soaking the earth with water
254,A POET TO HIS MUSE,That fed your roots and eased your way to the light.
255,A POET TO HIS MUSE,I gave you the sun and the rain
256,A POET TO HIS MUSE,But saved you from scorching and drowning:
257,A POET TO HIS MUSE,"You are mine, and only I know you,"
258,A POET TO HIS MUSE,"And the ways of your growth, and the days."

274,I,I
275,I,
276,I,I find my mind as it were a deep water.
277,I,
278,I,"Sometimes I play with a thought and hammer and bend it,"
279,I,"Till tired and displeased with that I toss it away,"
280,I,Or absently let it slip to the yawning water:
281,I,"And down it sinks, forgotten for many a day."
282,I,
283,I,But a time comes when tide or tempest washes it
284,I,"High on the beach, and I find that shape of mine,"
285,I,"Or I haul it out from the depths on some casual rope,"
286,I,"Or, passing over that spot in quiet shine,"
287,I,
288,I,"I see, where my boat's shadow makes deep the water,"
289,I,"A patch of colour, far down, from the bottom apart,"
290,I,"A wavering sign like the gleam from an ancient anchor,"
291,I,Brown fixing and fleeting flakes; and I feel my heart
292,I,
293,I,"Wake to a strange excitement; so that I stop,"
294,I,Put up my paddles and dredge with a careful net:
295,I,"And I catch it, and see it stir, and feel its weight,"
296,I,And pull till it nears and breaks from the water wet.
297,I,
298,I,And my eyes dwell on that old abandoned thing
299,I,Recovered by chance.  For the shape I had found so dull
300,I,"Has crusted and changed in secrecy and silence,"
301,I,"And its surface shines like a pearl, most beautiful."
302,I,
303,I,
304,II,II
305,II,
306,II,"In bed I lie, and my thoughts come filing by,"
307,II,"All forms and faces, cheerful, serene and sad:"
308,II,"Some clear, some mistily showing and fragmentary,"
309,II,Some altered in size or shape since last they were seen.
310,II,
311,II,"But O last, you group of merry ones!"
312,II,"Lord knows when I saw you before, but I met you once,"
313,II,"The whole collection of you, impudent-eyed;"
314,II,"And now, rosy and grinning, with linked arms"
315,II,"You go swingingly by, turning your faces to mine,"
316,II,"I laugh aloud; you bad lots; you are a secret,"
317,II,That nobody else knows.
318,II,
319,II,And you it was that made me break the procession
320,II,"(While memory gave me still the power of summons),"
321,II,And call up all I could of a half-hour's thoughts
322,II,To parade them across this proscenium of my skull
323,II,"In the order they came in, more carefully recognising"
324,II,"The old, and remarking which have developed or changed."
325,II,"And as for you, you rogues, I am almost certain"
326,II,There are one or two more of you now than once there were.
327,II,
328,II,*     *     *     *     *
329,II,
330,II,Good-bye!  Good-bye!  Dance through the dark door
331,II,In to the life that somewhere else you lead.
332,II,And one day I shall all unwittingly call
333,II,"Some word you know as a signal, or you'll see"
334,II,"Someone else coming my way; you'll suddenly follow,"
335,II,"And you'll appear again, quite possibly"
336,II,Bringing new friends--who are sure to be just as bad.
337,II,
338,II,
339,III,III
340,III,
341,III,"Into the pits of my heart and brain,"
342,III,"My eyes, ears, nose, tongue, fingers, like five gardeners"
343,III,"Are shovelling sights, sounds, odours, savours, contacts,"
344,III,"While I, their master, casually nod, and most times"
345,III,"Stand idly by, looking at something else,"
346,III,Forgetting that the work is going on
347,III,And only fully conscious of my servants
348,III,When something they move is consonant with my mood
349,III,"And draws my notice; or some other thing,"
350,III,"More strange than usual or stronger in its impact,"
351,III,Makes them exclaim and call to bid me watch.
352,III,
353,III,And then in a ground of more than our dimensions
354,III,Those quietly flowing cascades of things are hid.
355,III,"They are buried in those illimitable fields,"
356,III,And ever as they are swallowed by the earth
357,III,The steady hours passing in procession
358,III,Walk over them and trample them well down
359,III,"Out of sight, levelling all the soil."
360,III,
361,III,Then some time my returning feet uncover them
362,III,(My slaves are all agog with recognition)
363,III,Or else perhaps I come and idly dig
364,III,"To see what thing I can find, and out there comes"
365,III,Some old form buried twenty years ago
366,III,Now called a memory.
367,III,
368,III,Or marking well the place where one was put
369,III,"Find it and more, drawn thither under the ground,"
370,III,Tangled with others as flower-roots with roots
371,III,"Into a new festoon, or one old image,"
372,III,Wearing others like gems.  And that's creation.

672,WINTER NIGHTFALL,
673,WINTER NIGHTFALL,The old yellow stucco
674,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Of the time of the Regent
675,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Is flaking and peeling:
676,WINTER NIGHTFALL,The rows of square windows
677,WINTER NIGHTFALL,In the straight yellow building
678,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Are empty and still;
679,WINTER NIGHTFALL,And the dusty dark evergreens
680,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Guarding the wicket
681,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"Are draped with wet cobwebs,"
682,WINTER NIGHTFALL,And above this poor wilderness
683,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Toneless and sombre
684,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Is the flat of the hill.
685,WINTER NIGHTFALL,
686,WINTER NIGHTFALL,They said that a colonel
687,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Who long ago died here
688,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Was the last one to live here:
689,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"An old retired colonel,"
690,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"Some Fraser or Murray,"
691,WINTER NIGHTFALL,I don't know his name;
692,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"Death came here and summoned him,"

694,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Beyond all speculation;

697,WINTER NIGHTFALL,And nobody came.
698,WINTER NIGHTFALL,
699,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"Was it wet when he lived here,"
700,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"Were the skies dun and hurrying,"
701,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Was the rain so irresolute?
702,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"Did he watch the night coming,"
703,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Did he shiver at nightfall
704,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Before he was dead?
705,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"Did the wind go so creepily,"
706,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"Chilly and puffing,"
707,WINTER NIGHTFALL,With drops of cold rain in it?
708,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Was the hill's lifted shoulder
709,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"So lowering and menacing,"
710,WINTER NIGHTFALL,So dark and so dread?
711,WINTER NIGHTFALL,
712,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Did he turn through his doorway
713,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"And go to his study,"
714,WINTER NIGHTFALL,And light many candles?
715,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"And fold in the shutters,"
716,WINTER NIGHTFALL,And heap up the fireplace
717,WINTER NIGHTFALL,To fight off the damps?
718,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"And muse on his boyhood,"
719,WINTER NIGHTFALL,And wonder if India
720,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Ever was real?
721,WINTER NIGHTFALL,And shut out the loneliness
722,WINTER NIGHTFALL,With pig-sticking memoirs
723,WINTER NIGHTFALL,And collections of stamps?
724,WINTER NIGHTFALL,
725,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"Perhaps.  But he's gone now,"
726,WINTER NIGHTFALL,He and his furniture
727,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Dispersed now for ever;
728,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"And the last of his trophies,"
729,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"Antlers and photographs,"
730,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Heaven knows where.
731,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"And there's grass in his gateway,"
732,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"Grass on his footpath,"
733,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Grass on his door-step;
734,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"The garden's grown over,"
735,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"The well-chain is broken,"
736,WINTER NIGHTFALL,The windows are bare.
737,WINTER NIGHTFALL,
738,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"And I leave him behind me,"
739,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"For the straggling, discoloured"
740,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"Rags of the daylight,"
741,WINTER NIGHTFALL,And hills and stone walls
742,WINTER NIGHTFALL,And a rick long forgotten
743,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Of blackening hay:
744,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"The road pale and sticky,"
745,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"And cart-ruts and nail marks,"
746,WINTER NIGHTFALL,"And wind-ruffled puddles,"
747,WINTER NIGHTFALL,And the slop of my footsteps
748,WINTER NIGHTFALL,In this desolate country's
749,WINTER NIGHTFALL,Cadaverous clay.

761,A FAR PLACE,But at dawn and evening its trees were noisy with song.
762,A FAR PLACE,
763,A FAR PLACE,"There were four elms on the southward lawn standing,"
764,A FAR PLACE,Their great trunks evenly set in a square
765,A FAR PLACE,"Of shadowed grass in spring pierced with crocuses,"
766,A FAR PLACE,And their tops met high in the empty air.
767,A FAR PLACE,
768,A FAR PLACE,"Where the morning rose the grey church was below us,"
769,A FAR PLACE,If we stood by the porch we saw on either hand
770,A FAR PLACE,"The ground falling, the trees falling, and meadows,"
771,A FAR PLACE,"A river, hamlets and spires: a chequered land,"
772,A FAR PLACE,
773,A FAR PLACE,A wide country where cloud shadows went chasing
774,A FAR PLACE,"Mile after mile, diminishing fast, until"
775,A FAR PLACE,They met the far blue downs; but round the corner
776,A FAR PLACE,The western garden lay lonely under the hill.

778,A FAR PLACE,*     *     *     *     *

780,A FAR PLACE,"And closed in the western garden, under the hillside,"
781,A FAR PLACE,"Where silence was and the rest of the world was gone,"

783,A FAR PLACE,Changing from flower to flower the garden shone.
784,A FAR PLACE,
785,A FAR PLACE,"Early its walks were fringed with little rock-plants,"
786,A FAR PLACE,"Sprays and tufts of blossom, white, yellow, and blue,"
787,A FAR PLACE,"And all about were sprinkled stars of narcissus,"
788,A FAR PLACE,And swathes of tulips all over the garden grew.
789,A FAR PLACE,
790,A FAR PLACE,"White groups and pink, red, crimson and lemon-yellow,"
791,A FAR PLACE,And the yellow-and-red-streaked tulips once loved by a boy;
792,A FAR PLACE,"Red and yellow their stiff and varnished petals,"
793,A FAR PLACE,And the scent of them stings me still with a youthful joy.
794,A FAR PLACE,
795,A FAR PLACE,"And in the season of perfect and frailest beauty,"
796,A FAR PLACE,"Pear-blossom broke and the lilacs' waxen cones,"
797,A FAR PLACE,And a tranced laburnum trailing its veils of yellow
798,A FAR PLACE,Tenderly drooped over the ivied stones.
799,A FAR PLACE,
800,A FAR PLACE,"The lilacs browned, a breath dried the laburnum,"
801,A FAR PLACE,"The swollen peonies scattered the earth with blood,"
802,A FAR PLACE,"And the rhododendrons shed their sumptuous mantles,"
803,A FAR PLACE,And the marshalled irises unsceptred stood.
804,A FAR PLACE,
805,A FAR PLACE,And the borders filled with daisies and pied sweet-williams
806,A FAR PLACE,"And busy pansies; and there as we gazed and dreamed,"
807,A FAR PLACE,"And breathed the swooning smell of the packed carnations,"
808,A FAR PLACE,The present was always the crown of all: it seemed
809,A FAR PLACE,
810,A FAR PLACE,"Each month more beautiful sprang from a robe discarded,"
811,A FAR PLACE,The year all effortless dropt the best away
812,A FAR PLACE,"And struck the heart with loveliness new, more lavish;"
813,A FAR PLACE,"When the clambering rose had blown and died, by day"
814,A FAR PLACE,
815,A FAR PLACE,The broad-leaved tapering many-shielded hollyhocks
816,A FAR PLACE,"Stood like pillars and shone to the August sun,"
817,A FAR PLACE,The glimmering cups of waking evening primroses
818,A FAR PLACE,Filled the dusk now the scent of the rose was done.
819,A FAR PLACE,
820,A FAR PLACE,*     *     *     *     *
821,A FAR PLACE,
822,A FAR PLACE,"A wall there was and a door to the rose-garden,"
823,A FAR PLACE,"And out of that a gate to the orchard led,"
824,A FAR PLACE,"And there was the last hedge, and the turf sloped upward"
825,A FAR PLACE,Till the sky was cut by the hill's line overhead.
826,A FAR PLACE,
827,A FAR PLACE,"And thither at times we climbed, and far below us"
828,A FAR PLACE,"That world that had made the world remote was seen,"
829,A FAR PLACE,"Small, a huddle of russet roofs and chimneys,"
830,A FAR PLACE,And its guard of elms like bushes against the green:
831,A FAR PLACE,
832,A FAR PLACE,"One spot in the country, little and mild and homely,"
833,A FAR PLACE,"The nearest house of a wide, populous plain...."
834,A FAR PLACE,But down at evening under the stars and the branches
835,A FAR PLACE,In the whispering garden we lost the world again.
836,A FAR PLACE,
837,A FAR PLACE,*     *     *     *     *
838,A FAR PLACE,
839,A FAR PLACE,"Whispering, faint, the garden under the hillside..."
840,A FAR PLACE,Under the stars....  Is it true that we lived there long?

945,THE MOON,
946,THE MOON,(_To Maurice Baring_)
947,THE MOON,
948,THE MOON,I waited for a miracle to-night.
949,THE MOON,"Dim was the earth beneath a star-swept sky,"
950,THE MOON,"Her boughs were vague in that phantasmal light,"
951,THE MOON,Her current rippled past invisibly.
952,THE MOON,"No stir was in the dark and windless meadows,"
953,THE MOON,"Only the water, whispering in the shadows,"
954,THE MOON,That darkened nature lived did still proclaim.
955,THE MOON,"An hour I stood in that defeat of sight,"
956,THE MOON,"Waiting, and then a sudden silver flame"
957,THE MOON,"Burned in the eastern heaven, and she came."
958,THE MOON,
959,THE MOON,"The Moon, the Summer Moon, surveys the vale:"
960,THE MOON,"The boughs against the dawning sky grow black,"
961,THE MOON,"The shades that hid those whispering waters fail,"
962,THE MOON,"And now there falls a gleaming, lengthening track"
963,THE MOON,"That lies across the wide and tranquil river,"
964,THE MOON,"Burnished and flat, not shaken by a quiver."
965,THE MOON,She rises still: the liquid light she spills
966,THE MOON,"Makes everywhere quick sparkles, patches pale;"
967,THE MOON,"And, as she goes, I know her glory fills"
968,THE MOON,The air of all our English lakes and hills.
969,THE MOON,
970,THE MOON,High over all this England will she ride;
971,THE MOON,"She silvers all the roofs of folded towns,"
972,THE MOON,"Her brilliance tips the edge of every tide,"
973,THE MOON,Her shadows make soft caverns in the downs;
974,THE MOON,"Even now, beyond my tree serenely sailing,"
975,THE MOON,"She clothes far forests with a gauzy veiling,"
976,THE MOON,"And even as here, where now I stare and dream,"
977,THE MOON,"Standing my own transfigured banks beside,"
978,THE MOON,On many a quiet wandering English stream
979,THE MOON,There lies the unshifting image of her beam.
980,THE MOON,
981,THE MOON,"Yes, calm she mounts, and watching her, I know"
982,THE MOON,By many a river other eyes than mine
983,THE MOON,"Turn up to her; and, as of old, they show"
984,THE MOON,Their inward hearts all naked to her shine:
985,THE MOON,"Maids, solitaries, sick and happy lovers,"
986,THE MOON,To whom her dear returning orb discovers
987,THE MOON,"For each the gift he waits for: soft release,"
988,THE MOON,"The unsealing of imagination's flow,"
989,THE MOON,"Her own sweet pain, or other pain's surcease,"
990,THE MOON,The friendly benediction of her peace.
991,THE MOON,
992,THE MOON,"I too am held: as kind she is, as fair,"
993,THE MOON,As when long since a younger heart drank deep
994,THE MOON,"From that sweet solace, while, through summer air,"
995,THE MOON,Her lucid fingers hushed the world to sleep.
996,THE MOON,"O as I stand this latest moon beholding,"
997,THE MOON,Her forms unresting memory is moulding;
998,THE MOON,Beneath my enchanted eyelids there arise
999,THE MOON,"Visions again of many moons that were,"
1000,THE MOON,"Fair, fleeting moons gathered from faded skies,"
1001,THE MOON,Greeted and lost by these corporeal eyes.
1002,THE MOON,
1003,THE MOON,Unnumbered are those moons of memory
1004,THE MOON,Stored in the backward chambers of my brain:
1005,THE MOON,"The moons that make bright pathways on the sea,"
1006,THE MOON,The golden harvest moon above the grain;
1007,THE MOON,"The moon that all a sleeping village blanches,"
1008,THE MOON,"The woodland moon that roves beyond the branches,"
1009,THE MOON,Filtering through the meshes of the green
1010,THE MOON,To breast of bird and mossy trunk of tree;
1011,THE MOON,"Moons dimly guessed-at through a cloudy screen,"
1012,THE MOON,The bronze diffusion shed by moons unseen;
1013,THE MOON,
1014,THE MOON,"Moons that a thin prismatic halo rings,"
1015,THE MOON,Looking a hurrying fleecy heaven through;
1016,THE MOON,"The fairy moons of luminous evenings,"
1017,THE MOON,Phantoms of palest pink in palest blue;
1018,THE MOON,"Large orange moons on earth's grey verge suspended,"
1019,THE MOON,"When trees still slumber from the heat that's ended,"
1020,THE MOON,"Erect and heavy, and all waters lie"
1021,THE MOON,"Oily, and there is not a bird that sings."
1022,THE MOON,"All these I know, I have seen them born and die,"
1023,THE MOON,And many another moon in many a sky.
1024,THE MOON,
1025,THE MOON,There was a moon that shone above the ground
1026,THE MOON,Where on a grassy forest height I stood;
1027,THE MOON,"Bright was that open place, and all around"
1028,THE MOON,"The dense discovered tree-tops of the wood,"
1029,THE MOON,"Line after line, in misty radiance glistened,"
1030,THE MOON,Failing away.  I watched the scene and listened;
1031,THE MOON,"Then, awed and hushed, I turned and saw alone,"
1032,THE MOON,"Protruding from the middle of the mound,"
1033,THE MOON,"Fringed with close grass, a moonlit mottled stone,"
1034,THE MOON,"Rough-carven, of antiquity unknown."
1035,THE MOON,
1036,THE MOON,"A night there was, a crowd, a narrow street,"
1037,THE MOON,"Torches that reddened faces drunk with dreams,"
1038,THE MOON,"An orator exultant in defeat,"
1039,THE MOON,"Banners, fierce songs, rough cheering, women's screams;"
1040,THE MOON,"My heart was one with those rebellious people,"
1041,THE MOON,Until along a chapel's pointing steeple
1042,THE MOON,My eyes unwitting wandered to a thin
1043,THE MOON,"Crescent, and clouds a swift and ragged sheet;"
1044,THE MOON,And in my spirit's life all human din
1045,THE MOON,"Died, and eternal Silence stood within."
1046,THE MOON,
1047,THE MOON,"And once, on a far evening, warm and still,"
1048,THE MOON,I leant upon a cool stone parapet.
1049,THE MOON,The quays and houses underneath the hill
1050,THE MOON,Twinkled with lights; I heard the sea's faint fret;
1051,THE MOON,And then above the eastern cape's long billow
1052,THE MOON,"Silent there welled a trembling line of yellow,"
1053,THE MOON,"A shred that quickened, then a half that grew"
1054,THE MOON,"To a full moon, that moved with even will."
1055,THE MOON,"The night was long before her, well she knew,"
1056,THE MOON,"And, as she slowly rose into the blue,"
1057,THE MOON,
1058,THE MOON,"She slowly paled, and, glittering far away,"
1059,THE MOON,"Flung on the silken waters like a spear,"
1060,THE MOON,Her crispèd silver shaft of moonlight lay.
1061,THE MOON,The lighthouse lamp upon the little pier
1062,THE MOON,Burned wanly by that radiance clear and certain.
1063,THE MOON,"Waiting I knew not what uplifted curtain,"
1064,THE MOON,I watched the unmoving world beneath my feet
1065,THE MOON,"Till, without warning, miles across the bay,"
1066,THE MOON,"Into that silver out of shadows beat,"
1067,THE MOON,"Dead black, the whole mysterious fishing-fleet."
1068,THE MOON,
1069,THE MOON,"These moons I have seen, but these and every one"
1070,THE MOON,"Came each so new it seemed to be the first,"
1071,THE MOON,"New as the buds that open to the sun,"
1072,THE MOON,New as the songs that to the morning burst.
1073,THE MOON,"The roses die, each day fresh flowers are springing,"
1074,THE MOON,"Last year it was another blackbird singing,"
1075,THE MOON,"Thou only, marvellous blossom, whose pale flower"
1076,THE MOON,"Beyond mankind's conjecture hath begun,"
1077,THE MOON,Retain'st for ever an unwithering power
1078,THE MOON,That stales the loveliest stranger of an hour.
1079,THE MOON,
1080,THE MOON,"But O, had all my infant nights been dark,"
1081,THE MOON,"Or almost dark, lit by the stars alone,"
1082,THE MOON,Had never a teller of stories bid me hark
1083,THE MOON,The promised splendours of that moon unknown:
1084,THE MOON,How perfect then had been the revelation
1085,THE MOON,When first her gradual gold illumination
1086,THE MOON,Broke on a night upon the conscious child:
1087,THE MOON,"My heart had stopped with beauty, seeing her arc"
1088,THE MOON,"Climbing the heavens, so far and undefiled,"
1089,THE MOON,"So large with light, so even and so mild."
1090,THE MOON,
1091,THE MOON,"Most wondrous Light, who bring'st this lovelier earth,"
1092,THE MOON,"This world of shadows cool with silver fires,"
1093,THE MOON,Drawing us higher than our human birth:
1094,THE MOON,To whom our strange twin-natured kind suspires
1095,THE MOON,"Its saddest thoughts, and tenderest and most fragrant"
1096,THE MOON,"Tears, and desires unnameable and vagrant:"
1097,THE MOON,"Watcher, who leanest quietly from above,"
1098,THE MOON,Saying all mortal wars are nothing worth:
1099,THE MOON,"Friend of the sorrowful, tranquil as the dove,"
1100,THE MOON,"Muse of all poets, lamp of all who love."
1101,THE MOON,
1102,THE MOON,"Alone and sad, alone and kind and sweet,"
1103,THE MOON,"But always peaceful and removed and proud,"
1104,THE MOON,"Whether with loveliness revealed complete,"
1105,THE MOON,Or veiling from our vision in a cloud:
1106,THE MOON,"Our souls' eternal listener, could we wonder"
1107,THE MOON,That men who made of sun and storm and thunder
1108,THE MOON,"The awful forms of strong divinity,"
1109,THE MOON,"Heard in each storm the noise of travelling feet,"
1110,THE MOON,"Should, gazing at thy face with hearts made free,"
1111,THE MOON,"Have felt a pure, immortal Power in thee?"
1112,THE MOON,
1113,THE MOON,"Selene, Cynthia, and Artemis,"
1114,THE MOON,"The swift proud goddess with the silver bow,"
1115,THE MOON,"Diana, she whose downward-bending kiss"
1116,THE MOON,"One only knew, though all men yearned to know;"
1117,THE MOON,"The shepherd on a hill his flock was keeping,"
1118,THE MOON,The night's pale huntress came and found him sleeping:
1119,THE MOON,"She stooped: he woke, and saw her hair that shone,"
1120,THE MOON,"And lay, drawn up to cool and timeless bliss"
1121,THE MOON,"Lapt in her radiant arms, Endymion,"
1122,THE MOON,"All the still night, until the night was gone."
1123,THE MOON,
1124,THE MOON,"By many names they knew thee, but thy shape"
1125,THE MOON,"Was woman's always, transient and white:"
1126,THE MOON,"A flashing huntress leaving hinds agape,"
1127,THE MOON,A sweet descent of beauty in the night:
1128,THE MOON,"Yet some, more fierce and more distraught their dreaming,"
1129,THE MOON,"Brooded, until they fashioned from thy seeming,"
1130,THE MOON,"A lithe and luring queen with fatal breath,"
1131,THE MOON,"A witch the man who saw might not escape,"
1132,THE MOON,"A snare that gleamed in shadowy groves of death,"
1133,THE MOON,The tall tiaraed Syrian Ashtoreth.
1134,THE MOON,
1135,THE MOON,And even to-night in African forests some
1136,THE MOON,"There are, possessed by such a blasphemy;"
1137,THE MOON,Through branching beams thy fevered votaries come
1138,THE MOON,To appease their brains' distorted mask of thee.
1139,THE MOON,"There in the glades the drums pulsate and languish,"
1140,THE MOON,Men leap and wail to dim the victim's anguish
1141,THE MOON,In the sad frenzy of the sacrifice.
1142,THE MOON,"They are slaves to thee, made mad because thou art dumb,"
1143,THE MOON,"And dumb thou lookest on them from the skies,"
1144,THE MOON,"Above their fires and dances, blood and cries."
1145,THE MOON,
1146,THE MOON,"So these; but otherwhere, at such an hour,"
1147,THE MOON,"In all the continents, by all the seas,"
1148,THE MOON,"Men, naming not the goddess, feel thy power,"
1149,THE MOON,Adoring her with gentler rites than these:
1150,THE MOON,The thoughts of myriad hearts to thee uplifted
1151,THE MOON,"Rise like a smoke above thine altars drifted,"
1152,THE MOON,Perpetual incense poured before thy throne
1153,THE MOON,"By those whom thou hast given thy secret dower,"
1154,THE MOON,"Those in whose kindred eyes thy light is known,"
1155,THE MOON,Whom thou hast signed and sealed for thine own.
1156,THE MOON,
1157,THE MOON,"For thee they watch by Asian peaks remote,"
1158,THE MOON,Where thy snows gleam above the pointing pines;
1159,THE MOON,Entranced on templed lakes is many a boat
1160,THE MOON,"For thee, where clear thy dropt reflection shines;"
1161,THE MOON,"On the great seas where nothing else is tender,"
1162,THE MOON,"Rising and setting, unto thee surrender"
1163,THE MOON,All lonely hearts in lonely wandering ships;
1164,THE MOON,"And, where their warm far-scattered islands float,"
1165,THE MOON,Through forests many a flower-crowned maiden slips
1166,THE MOON,"To gaze on thee, with parted burning lips."
1167,THE MOON,
1168,THE MOON,"O thus they do, and thus they did of old;"
1169,THE MOON,Our hearts were never secret in thy sight;
1170,THE MOON,Ere our first records were thy shrine was cold
1171,THE MOON,That speechless eyes went seeking in the night;
1172,THE MOON,Beyond the compass of our dim traditions
1173,THE MOON,"Thou knewest of men the pitiful ambitions,"
1174,THE MOON,Their loves and their despair; within thy ken
1175,THE MOON,All our poor history has been unrolled;
1176,THE MOON,"Thou hast seen all races born and die again,"
1177,THE MOON,The climbing and the crumbling towers of men.
1178,THE MOON,
1179,THE MOON,Black were the hollows of that Emperor's eyes
1180,THE MOON,"Who paced with backward arms beyond his tents,"
1181,THE MOON,"Lone in the night, and felt above him rise"
1182,THE MOON,"The ancient conqueror's sloping, smooth, immense,"
1183,THE MOON,"Moon-pointing Pyramid's enduring courses,"
1184,THE MOON,"Heard not his sentries, nor his stamping horses,"
1185,THE MOON,"But thought of Egypt dead upon that air,"
1186,THE MOON,Fighting with his moon-coloured memories
1187,THE MOON,"Of vanished kings who builded, and the bare"
1188,THE MOON,Sands in the moon before those builders were.
1189,THE MOON,
1190,THE MOON,"Restless, he knew that moon who watched him muse,"
1191,THE MOON,Had seen a restless Cæsar brood on fame
1192,THE MOON,Amid the Pharaohs' broken avenues.
1193,THE MOON,"And, circling round that fixed monition, came"
1194,THE MOON,"Woven by moonlight, random, transitory,"
1195,THE MOON,Fragments of all the dim receding story:
1196,THE MOON,The moonlit water dripping from the oars
1197,THE MOON,Of triremes in the bay of Syracuse;
1198,THE MOON,"The opposing bivouacs upon the shores,"
1199,THE MOON,That knew dead Hector's and Achilles' wars.
1200,THE MOON,
1201,THE MOON,"He saw fall'n Carthage, Alexander's grave,"
1202,THE MOON,"The tomb of Moses in the wilderness,"
1203,THE MOON,The moonlight on the Atlantean wave
1204,THE MOON,That covered all a multitude's distress:
1205,THE MOON,Cities and hosts and emperors departed
1206,THE MOON,Under the steady moon.  And sullen-hearted
1207,THE MOON,"He turned away, and, in a little, died,"
1208,THE MOON,Even as he who hunted from his cave
1209,THE MOON,"And struck his foe, and stripped the shaggy hide"
1210,THE MOON,"Under the moon, and was not satisfied."
1211,THE MOON,
1212,THE MOON,"For in the prime, thy influence was felt;"
1213,THE MOON,"When eyes first saw, thy beauty was as this;"
1214,THE MOON,"Thy quiet look bade hope, fear, passion melt"
1215,THE MOON,Before men dreamed of empire.  The abyss
1216,THE MOON,"Of thought yawned through their jungle then, as ever"
1217,THE MOON,"Dark past, dark future, menaced their endeavour:"
1218,THE MOON,"Yet, on thy nights, stood some by hill and sea"
1219,THE MOON,"Naked; and blind impulsive spirits knelt,"
1220,THE MOON,"Not questioning why they knelt, feeling in thee"
1221,THE MOON,"Thought's strangest, sweetest, saddest mystery."
1222,THE MOON,
1223,THE MOON,"Still Moon, bright Moon, compassionate Moon above,"
1224,THE MOON,"Thou shinedst there ere any life began,"
1225,THE MOON,When of his pain or of his powerless love
1226,THE MOON,Thou heardest not from heart of any man;
1227,THE MOON,Though long the earth had shaken off the vapour
1228,THE MOON,"Left by the vanished gleams of fire, the shaper,"
1229,THE MOON,"Old, old, her stony wrinkled face did grow"
1230,THE MOON,Whilst only her blind elements did move;
1231,THE MOON,"Dumb, bare, and prayerless thou saw'st her go,"
1232,THE MOON,And afterwards again shalt see her so.
1233,THE MOON,
1234,THE MOON,"A time there was when Life had never been,"
1235,THE MOON,"A time will be, it will have passed away;"
1236,THE MOON,"Still wilt thou shine, still tender and serene,"
1237,THE MOON,When Life which in thy sister's yesterday
1238,THE MOON,"Had never flowered, will have drooped and faded;"
1239,THE MOON,Passed with the clouds that once her bosom shaded.
1240,THE MOON,"She will be barren then as not before,"
1241,THE MOON,Bared of her snows and all her garments green;
1242,THE MOON,No darkling sea by any earthly shore
1243,THE MOON,Will take thy rays: thy kin will be no more.
1244,THE MOON,
1245,THE MOON,"Pale satellite, old mistress of our fires,"
1246,THE MOON,"Who hast seen so much and been so much to men,"
1247,THE MOON,"Symbol and goal of all our wild desires,"
1248,THE MOON,Not any voice will cry upon thee then;
1249,THE MOON,"Dreamer and dream, they will have all gone over,"
1250,THE MOON,"The sick of heart, the singer and the lover,"
1251,THE MOON,"An end there will have been to all their lust,"
1252,THE MOON,"Their sorrow, and the sighing of their lyres;"
1253,THE MOON,"O all this Life that stained Earth's patient crust,"
1254,THE MOON,Time's dying breath will have blown away like dust.
1255,THE MOON,
1256,THE MOON,"Gone from thine eye that brief confusèd stir,"
1257,THE MOON,The rumours and the marching and the strife;
1258,THE MOON,"Earth will be still, and all the face of her"
1259,THE MOON,Swept of the last remains of moving life;
1260,THE MOON,"The last of all men's monuments that defied them,"
1261,THE MOON,"Like those his valiant gestures that denied them,"
1262,THE MOON,"Into the waiting elements will fade,"
1263,THE MOON,"And thou wilt see thy fellow traveller,"
1264,THE MOON,"A forlorn round of rocky contours made,"
1265,THE MOON,"A glimmering disk of empty light and shade,"
1266,THE MOON,
1267,THE MOON,"Ah, depth too deep for thought therein to cast;"
1268,THE MOON,"The old, the cold companions, you will go,"
1269,THE MOON,"Obeying still some long-forgotten past,"
1270,THE MOON,And all our pitiful history none will know;
1271,THE MOON,"Still shining, Moon, still peaceful, wilt thou wander,"
1272,THE MOON,But on that greater ball no heart will ponder
1273,THE MOON,"The thought that rose and nightingale are gone,"
1274,THE MOON,And all sweet things but thou; and only vast
1275,THE MOON,"Ridges of rock remain, and stars and sun;"
1276,THE MOON,"O Moon, thou wilt be lovely alone for none."
1277,THE MOON,
1278,THE MOON,"And so, pale wanderer, so thou leavest me,"
1279,THE MOON,"Passing beyond imagination's range,"
1280,THE MOON,Away into the void where waits for thee
1281,THE MOON,Thy inconceivable destiny of change;
1282,THE MOON,And after all the memories I have striven
1283,THE MOON,"To paint, this picture that thyself hast given"
1284,THE MOON,"Lives, and I watch, to all those others blind,"
1285,THE MOON,"Thy form, gliding into eternity,"
1286,THE MOON,"Fading, an unconjectured fate to find,"
1287,THE MOON,"The last, most wonderful image of the mind."

1296,THE HAPPY NIGHT,"I have known my love to-night as never before,"
1297,THE HAPPY NIGHT,"I have flung myself in the deep, and drawn from the deep,"
1298,THE HAPPY NIGHT,"And kissed her lightly, and left my beloved to sleep."
1299,THE HAPPY NIGHT,And now I sit in the night and my heart is still:
1300,THE HAPPY NIGHT,"Strong and secure; there is nothing that's left to will,"
1301,THE HAPPY NIGHT,There is nothing to win but only a thing to keep.
1302,THE HAPPY NIGHT,
1303,THE HAPPY NIGHT,"And I look to-night, completed and not afraid,"

1306,THE HAPPY NIGHT,Nor fear that death should suddenly come to-night.

1402,ELEGY,"Assumed you better, quenched the uneasy doubt"
1403,ELEGY,"You might need faces, or have things to say."
1404,ELEGY,Did I think of you last evening?  Dead you lay.
1405,ELEGY,O bitter words of conscience
1406,ELEGY,"I hold the simple message,"
1407,ELEGY,And fierce with grief the awakened heart cries out:
1408,ELEGY,"""It shall not be to-day;"
1409,ELEGY,

1432,ELEGY,"With modest ease; yet would you soonest pore,"
1433,ELEGY,"Smiling, with most affection in your look,"
1434,ELEGY,On the ripe ancient and the curious nook.

1436,ELEGY,"Divines and buried poets,"
1437,ELEGY,"You knew them all, but never half your lore"
1438,ELEGY,Was drawn from any book.
1439,ELEGY,
1440,ELEGY,"Stories and jests from field and town and port,"

1454,ELEGY,"Of a long brown face, bare arms and flimsy vest,"
1455,ELEGY,"In fragments through the branches,"
1456,ELEGY,Above the green reflections:
1457,ELEGY,Paused by the willows in your varnished boat
1458,ELEGY,"You, with your oars at rest."
1459,ELEGY,
1460,ELEGY,Did that come back to you when you were dying?
1461,ELEGY,"I think it did: you had much leisure there,"
1462,ELEGY,"And, with the things we knew, came quietly flying"
1463,ELEGY,Memories of things you had seen we knew not where.
1464,ELEGY,You watched again with meditative stare
1465,ELEGY,"Places where you had wandered,"
1466,ELEGY,Golden and calm in distance:
1467,ELEGY,Voices from all your altering past came sighing
1468,ELEGY,On the soft Hampshire air.
1469,ELEGY,
1470,ELEGY,"For there you sat a hundred miles away,"
1471,ELEGY,"A rug upon your knees, your hands gone frail,"
1472,ELEGY,"And daily bade your farewell to the day,"
1473,ELEGY,A music blent of trees and clouds asail
1474,ELEGY,And figures in some old neglected tale:
1475,ELEGY,"And watched the sunset gathering,"
1476,ELEGY,"And heard the birdsong fading,"
1477,ELEGY,And went within when the last sleepy lay
1478,ELEGY,Passed to a farther vale.
1479,ELEGY,
1480,ELEGY,"Never complaining, and stepped up to bed"
1481,ELEGY,"More and more slow, a tall and sunburnt man"
1482,ELEGY,"Grown bony and bearded, knowing you would be dead"
1483,ELEGY,"Before the summer, glad your life began"
1484,ELEGY,"Even thus to end, after so short a span,"
1485,ELEGY,"And mused a space serenely,"
1486,ELEGY,"Then fell to easy slumber,"
1487,ELEGY,"At peace, content.  For never again your head"
1488,ELEGY,Need make another plan.
1489,ELEGY,
1490,ELEGY,"Most generous, most gentle, most discreet,"
1491,ELEGY,Who left us ignorant to spare us pain:
1492,ELEGY,We went our ways with too forgetful feet
1493,ELEGY,"And missed the chance that would not come again,"
1494,ELEGY,"Leaving, with thoughts on pleasure bent, or gain,"
1495,ELEGY,Fidelity unattested
1496,ELEGY,And services unrendered:
1497,ELEGY,"The ears are closed, the heart has ceased to beat,"
1498,ELEGY,And now all proof is vain.
1499,ELEGY,
1500,ELEGY,"Too late for other gifts, I give you this,"
1501,ELEGY,"Who took from you so much, so carelessly,"
1502,ELEGY,"On your far brows a first and phantom kiss,"
1503,ELEGY,On your far grave a careful elegy.
1504,ELEGY,"For one who loved all life and poetry,"
1505,ELEGY,"Sorrow in music bleeding,"
1506,ELEGY,And friendship's last confession.
1507,ELEGY,But even as I speak that inner kiss
1508,ELEGY,"Softly accuses me,"
1509,ELEGY,
1510,ELEGY,"Saying: Those brows are senseless, deaf that tomb,"
1511,ELEGY,"This is the callous, cold resort of art."
1512,ELEGY,"""I give you this.""  What do I give? to whom?"
1513,ELEGY,"Words to the air, and balm to my own heart,"
1514,ELEGY,To its old luxurious and commanded smart.
1515,ELEGY,"An end to all this tuning,"
1516,ELEGY,This cynical masquerading;
1517,ELEGY,What comfort now in that far final gloom
1518,ELEGY,Can any song impart?
1519,ELEGY,
1520,ELEGY,"O yet I see you dawning from some heaven,"
1521,ELEGY,Who would not suffer self-reproach to live
1522,ELEGY,In one to whom your friendship once was given.
1523,ELEGY,"I catch a vision, faint and fugitive,"
1524,ELEGY,"Of a dark face with eyes contemplative,"
1525,ELEGY,"Deep eyes that smile in silence,"
1526,ELEGY,"And parted lips that whisper,"

1742,II,"Look at the faces around you, active and gay,"
1743,II,"They are lined, there are brains behind them, breasts beneath them,"
1744,II,"They have only escaped for an hour, and even now"
1745,II,"Many, like you, have not escaped; and away"
1746,II,"Across the field those faces ascending in tiers,"
1747,II,"Each face is a story, a tragedy and a doubt;"
1748,II,"And the teams where they wait, in the sacred place to the right,"
1749,II,"Are bewildered souls, who have heard of and brooded on death,"
1750,II,And thought about God.  But this is a football match;
1751,II,"And anyhow I don't feel equal to thinking,"
1752,II,And I'm certain the teams don't; they've something better to do.
1753,II,"It is half-past two, and, thank Heaven, a minute over."
1754,II,We are all here now.  The laggards have all booked seats
1755,II,And stroll in lordly leisure along the front.
1756,II,"What a man!  Six foot, silk hat, brown face, moustache!"
1757,II,"What a fat complacent parson, snuggling down"
1758,II,"In the chair there, among all his cackling ladies!"
1759,II,I have seen that youth before.  My neighbour now
1760,II,"On my left shouts out to a college friend below us,"
1761,II,"""Tommy!  Hallo!  Do you think we are going to beat 'em?"""
1762,II,My watch.  Twenty-to-three.  That lot went quickly;
1763,II,Five minutes more is nothing; I'm lively now
1764,II,"And fit for a five-mile run.  One, two, three, four..."
1765,II,"It isn't worth bothering now, it's all but here,"
1766,II,"Here, here; a rustle, a murmur, a ready silence,"
1767,II,"A billowing cheer--why, here they come, running and passing,"
1768,II,"The challenging team!  By God, what magnificent fellows!"
1769,II,"They have dropped the ball, they pause, they sweep onward again,"
1770,II,"And so to the end.  Here are the rest of them,"
1771,II,"Swingingly up the field and back as they came,"
1772,II,"With the cheers swelling and swelling.  They disappear,"
1773,II,"And out, like wind upon water, come their rivals,"
1774,II,"With cheers swelling and swelling, to run and turn"
1775,II,"And vanish; and now they are all come out together,"
1776,II,"Two teams walking, touch-judges and referee."
1777,II,"And they all line up, dotted about like chessmen,"
1778,II,"And the multitude holds its breath, and awaits the start."
1779,II,
1780,II,
1781,III,III
1782,III,
1783,III,"Whistle!  A kick!  A rush, a scramble, a scrum,"
1784,III,"The forwards are busy already, the halves hover round,"
1785,III,"The three-quarters stand in backwards diverging lines,"
1786,III,"Eagerly bent, atoe, with elbows back,"
1787,III,"And hands that would grasp at a ball, trembling to start,"
1788,III,While the solid backs vigilant stray about
1789,III,"And the crowd gives out a steady resolute roar,"
1790,III,"Like the roar of a sea; a scrum, a whistle, a scrum;"
1791,III,"A burst, a whistle, a scrum, a kick into touch;"
1792,III,"All in the middle of the field.  He is tossing it in,"
1793,III,"They have got it and downed it, and whurry, oh, here they come,"
1794,III,"Streaming like a waterfall, oh, he has knocked it on,"
1795,III,"Right at our feet, and the scrum is formed again,"
1796,III,And everything seems to stop while they pack and go crooked.
1797,III,The scrum-half beats them straight with a rough smack
1798,III,"While he holds the ball, debonair....  How it all comes back,"
1799,III,As the steam goes up of their breath and their sweating trunks!
1800,III,"The head low down, the eyes that swim to the ground,"
1801,III,"The mesh of ownerless knees, the patch of dark earth,"
1802,III,"The ball that comes in, and wedges and jerks, and is caught,"
1803,III,"And sticks, the dense intoxicant smell of sweat,"
1804,III,"The grip on the moisture of jerseys, the sickening urge"
1805,III,That seems powerless to help; the desperate final shove
1806,III,"That somehow is timed with a general effort, the sweep"
1807,III,"Onward, while enemies reel, and the whole scrum turns"
1808,III,"And we torrent away with the ball.  Oh, I know it all...."
1809,III,"I know it....  Where are they? ...  Far on the opposite line,"
1810,III,"Aimlessly kicking while the forwards stand gaping about,"
1811,III,"Deprived of their work.  Convergence.  They are coming again,"
1812,III,"They are scrumming again below, red hair, black cap,"
1813,III,And a horde of dark colourless heads and straining backs;
1814,III,A voice rasps up through the howl of the crowd around
1815,III,(Triumphant now in possession over all the rest
1816,III,Of crowds who have lost the moving treasure to us)--
1817,III,"""Push, you devils!""  They push, and push, and push;"
1818,III,"The opponents yield, the fortress wall goes down,"
1819,III,"The ram goes through, an irresistible rush"
1820,III,"Crosses the last white line, and tumbles down,"
1821,III,And the ball is there.  A try!  A try!  A try!
1822,III,The shout from the host we are assaults the sky.
1823,III,
1824,III,"Deep silence.  Line up by the goal-posts.  A man lying down,"
1825,III,"Poising the pointed ball, slanted away,"
1826,III,"And another who stands, and hesitates, and runs"
1827,III,"And lunges out with his foot, and the ball soars up,"
1828,III,"While the opposite forwards rush below it in vain,"
1829,III,"And curves to the posts, and passes them just outside."
1830,III,The touch-judge's flag hangs still.  It was only a try!
1831,III,"Three points to us.  The roar is continuous now,"
1832,III,The game swings to and fro like a pendulum
1833,III,"Struck by a violent hand.  But the impetus wanes,"
1834,III,"The forwards are getting tired, and all the outsides"
1835,III,"Run weakly, pass loosely; there are one or two penalty kicks,"
1836,III,And a feeble attempt from a mark.  The ball goes out
1837,III,"Over the heads of the crowd, comes wearily back;"
1838,III,"And, lingering about in mid-field, the tedious game"
1839,III,Seems for a while a thing interminable.
1840,III,"And nothing happens, till all of a sudden a shrill"
1841,III,Blast from the whistle flies out and arrests the game.
1842,III,"Half-time ... Unlocking ... The players are all erect,"
1843,III,"Easy and friendly, standing about in groups,"
1844,III,"Figures in sculpture, better for mud-stained clothes;"
1845,III,"Couples from either side chatting and laughing,"
1846,III,"And chewing lemons, and throwing the rinds away."
1847,III,
1848,III,
1849,IV,IV
1850,IV,
1851,IV,"The pause is over.  They part from each other, sift out;"
1852,IV,"The backs trot out to their stations, the forwards spread;"
1853,IV,"The captains beckon with hands, and the ball goes off"
1854,IV,To volleys and answering volleys of harsher cheers;
1855,IV,"For the top of the hill is past, we course to the close."
1856,IV,We've a three-point lead.  Can we keep it?  It isn't enough.
1857,IV,"We have always heard their three-quarters were better than ours,"
1858,IV,"If they once get the ball.  They have got it, he runs, he passes,"
1859,IV,"The centre dodges, is tackled, passes in time"
1860,IV,To the other centre who goes like a bird to the left
1861,IV,And flings it out to the wing.  The goal is open;
1862,IV,"He has only to run as he can.  No, the back is across,"
1863,IV,"He has missed him; he has him; they topple, head over heels,"
1864,IV,And the ball bumps along into touch.  They are stuck on our line;
1865,IV,"Scrum after scrum, with those dangerous threes standing waiting,"
1866,IV,"Threat after threat forced back; a save, a return;"
1867,IV,"And the same thing over again, till the ball goes out"
1868,IV,"Almost unnoticed, and before we can see what is done,"
1869,IV,"That centre has kicked, he has thought of the four points,"
1870,IV,"The ball soars, slackens, keeps upright with effort,"
1871,IV,"Then floats between posts and falls, ignored, to the ground,"
1872,IV,"Its grandeur gone, while the touch-judge flaps his flag,"
1873,IV,And the multitude becomes an enormous din
1874,IV,"Which dies as the game resumes, and then rises again,"
1875,IV,"As battle of cry of triumph and counter-cry,"
1876,IV,"Defiant, like great waves surging against each other."
1877,IV,"They work to the other corner, they stay there long;"
1878,IV,"They push and wheel, there are runs that come to nothing,"
1879,IV,"Till the noise wanes, and a curious silence comes."
1880,IV,"They lead by a point, their crowd is sobered now,"
1881,IV,"Anxious still lest a sudden chance should come,"
1882,IV,Or a sudden resource of power in mysterious foes
1883,IV,"Which may dash them again from their new precarious peak,"
1884,IV,Whilst we in our hearts are aware of the chilling touch
1885,IV,"Of loss, of a fatal thing irrevocable,"
1886,IV,"Feel the time fly to the dreaded last wail of the whistle,"
1887,IV,And see our team as desperate waves that dash
1888,IV,"Against a wall of rock, to be scattered in spray."
1889,IV,"Yet fervour comes back, for the players have no thought for the past"
1890,IV,"Except as a goad to new effort, not they will be chilled:"
1891,IV,"Fiercer and faster they fight, a grimness comes"
1892,IV,Into shoving and running and tackling and handing off.
1893,IV,"We are heeling the ball now cleanly, time after time"
1894,IV,"Our half picks it up and instantly jabs it away,"
1895,IV,And the beautiful swift diagonal quarter-line
1896,IV,Tips it across for the wing to go like a stag
1897,IV,Till he's cornered and falls and the gate swings shut again.
1898,IV,"Thirty fighting devils, ten thousand throats,"
1899,IV,"Thundering joy at each pass and tackle and punt,"
1900,IV,"Yet the consciousness grows that the time approaches the end,"
1901,IV,The threat of conclusion grows like a spreading tree
1902,IV,"And casts its shadow on all the anxious people,"
1903,IV,And is fully known when they stop as a man's knocked out
1904,IV,And limps from the field with his arms round two comrades' necks.
1905,IV,The gradual time seems to have suddenly leapt....
1906,IV,And all this while the unheeded winter sky
1907,IV,"Has faded, and the air gone bluer and mistier."
1908,IV,"The players, when they drift away to a corner"
1909,IV,"Distant from us, seem to have left our world."
1910,IV,"We see the struggling forms, tangling and tumbling,"
1911,IV,"We hear the noise from the featureless mass around them,"
1912,IV,But the dusk divides.  Finality seems to have come.
1913,IV,Nothing can happen now.  The attention drifts.
1914,IV,"There's a pause; I become a separate thing again,"
1915,IV,"Almost forget the game, forget my neighbours,"
1916,IV,And the noise fades in my ears to a dim rumour.
1917,IV,"I watch the lines and colours of field and buildings,"
1918,IV,"So simple and soft and few in the vapoury air,"
1919,IV,I am held by the brightening orange lights of the matches
1920,IV,"Perpetually pricking the haze across the ground,"
1921,IV,"And the scene is tinged with a quiet melancholy,"
1922,IV,"The harmonious sadness of twilight on willowed waters,"
1923,IV,Still avenues or harbours seen from the sea.
1924,IV,"Yet a louder shout recalls me, I wake again,"
1925,IV,"Find there are two minutes left, and it's nearly over,"
1926,IV,"See a few weaklings already walking out,"
1927,IV,Caring more to avoid a crush with the crowd
1928,IV,Than to give the last stroke to a ritual of courtesy
1929,IV,"And a work of intangible art.  But we're all getting ready,"
1930,IV,"Hope gone, and fear, except in the battling teams."
1931,IV,"Regret ... a quick movement of hazy forms,"
1932,IV,"Oh quiet, oh look, there is something happening,"
1933,IV,Sudden one phantom form on the other wing
1934,IV,"Emerges from nothingness, is singled out,"
1935,IV,"Curving in a long sweep like a flying gull,"
1936,IV,"Through the thick fog, swifter as borne by wind,"
1937,IV,"Swerves at the place where the corner-flag must be,"
1938,IV,"And runs, by Heaven he's over! and runs, and runs,"
1939,IV,"And our hearts leap, and our sticks go up in the air"
1940,IV,"And our hats whirl, and we lose ourselves in a yell"
1941,IV,For a try behind the posts.  We have beaten them!
1942,IV,
1943,IV,
1944,V,V
1945,V,
1946,V,"Outside; and a mob hailing cabs, besieging the station,"
1947,V,"Sticks, overcoats, scarves, bowler hats, intensified faces,"
1948,V,"Rushes, apologies, voices: ""Simpson's at seven,"""
1949,V,"""Hallo, Jim,"" ""See you next term,"" ""I've just seen old Peter."""
1950,V,"They go to their homes, to catch trains, all over the city,"
1951,V,"All over England; or, many, to make a good night of it,"
1952,V,"Eat oysters, drink more than usual, dispute of the match."
1953,V,"For the match is all over, and what, being done, does it matter?"
1954,V,"What happened last year?  I was here; I should know, but I don't."
1955,V,"Next year there will be another, with another result,"
1956,V,"Just such another crowd, just as excited."
1957,V,"And after next year, for a year and a year and a year,"
1958,V,Till customs have changed and things crumbled and all this strife
1959,V,"Is a dim word from the past.  Why, even to-night,"
1960,V,"When the last door has been locked, the last groundsman will go,"
1961,V,"Leaving that field which was conquered and full of men,"
1962,V,"With darkened houses around, void and awake,"
1963,V,Silently talking to the silent travelling moon:
1964,V,"""The day passed.  They have gone again.  They will die."""
1965,V,To-night in the moon the neighbouring roofs will lie
1966,V,"Lonely and still, all of their dwellers in bed;"
1967,V,"The phantom stands will glisten, the goal-posts rise"
1968,V,"Slanting their shadows across the grass, as calm"
1969,V,"As though they had never challenged an eager swarm,"
1970,V,Or any ball had made their crossbars quiver.
1971,V,"Clouds will pass, and the city's murmur fade,"
1972,V,And the open field await its destiny
1973,V,Of transient invaders coming and going.
1974,V,What was the point of it?  Why did the heart leap high
1975,V,"Putting reason back, to watch that fugitive play?"
1976,V,Why not?  We must all distract ourselves with toys.
1977,V,"Not a brick nor a heap remains, the more durable product"
1978,V,"Of all that; effort and pain.  Yet, sooner or later,"
1979,V,"As much may be said of any human game,"
1980,V,"War, politics, art, building, planting and ploughing,"
1981,V,"The explorer's freezing, the astronomer's searching of stars,"
1982,V,"The philosopher's fight through the thickening webs of thought,"
1983,V,"And the writing of poems: a hand, a stir and a sinking."
1984,V,"And so, no more, of the general game of the Race,"
1985,V,"That cannot know of its origin or its end,"
1986,V,"But strives, for their own sake, its courage and skill"
1987,V,"To increase, till Frost or a Flying Flame calls ""Time!"""
1988,V,"I have seen this day men in the beauty of movement,"
1989,V,"A gallant jaw set, the form of a hero that flew,"
1990,V,"Cunning, a selfless flinging of self in the fray,"
1991,V,"Strength, compassion, control, the obeying of laws,"
1992,V,"Victory, and a struggle against defeat."
1993,V,"I think that the Power that gave us the bodies we have,"
1994,V,"Can only be praised by our use of the things He gave,"
1995,V,"That we are not here to turn our backs to the sun,"
1996,V,Or to scorn the delight of our limbs.  And for those who have eyes
1997,V,"The beauty of this is the same as the beauty of flowers,"
1998,V,"And of eagles and lions and mountains and oceans and stars,"
1999,V,"And I care not, but rather am glad that the thought will recur"
2000,V,That in Egypt the muscles moved under the shining skins
2001,V,"As here, and in Greece where Olympian champions died,"
2002,V,"And in isles long ago, where never a record was kept."
2003,V,"And now I'll go home, and open a bottle of port,"
2004,V,"And think upon beauty and God and the wonder of love,"
2005,V,"That laughs at the shadow of Death, and my vanished youth,"
2006,V,"And the throbbing heart that beats its own drum to the grave,"
2007,V,"Returning absurdly again to the fact that we won,"
2008,V,"Content to let darkness deepen, and stars shine."
