868,THE ROLLING SAINT,They cramped her in a barrel
869,THE ROLLING SAINT,--All but her bobbing head.

1025,ALCMENA,I have commanded you as often of old
1026,ALCMENA,"To ply the doctor’s trade with my disease,"
1027,ALCMENA,To cure me or to kill; for in whose veins
1028,ALCMENA,"Courses the age-long poison of despair,"

1107,ALCMENA,There comes to every man a sudden time
1108,ALCMENA,When he undoes the bolts that bar his heart
1109,ALCMENA,Displaying hidden shame and scars concealed.
1110,ALCMENA,Such season is the present. Hear me now;
1111,ALCMENA,For I am sick and pale with lingering
1112,ALCMENA,Over a mystery that has no clue
1113,ALCMENA,Created idly by an idle brain.
1114,ALCMENA,"Astrologers, thrice mighty in yourselves,"
1115,ALCMENA,"Say whence crept into me this discontent,"
1116,ALCMENA,This fretfulness of mine. Say whence arose
1117,ALCMENA,"My malady, so cunning in its ways,"
1118,ALCMENA,That I tormented have no skill to guide
1119,ALCMENA,My doctors to the secret. Day by day
1120,ALCMENA,I feel the heavy burden of the flesh
1121,ALCMENA,Grow heavier. Your words rang true indeed.
1122,ALCMENA,"Though I am young, I am grown weary of life."
1123,ALCMENA,The tedious cycle of each passing day
1124,ALCMENA,Like streams of dripping tears from blinded eyes
1125,ALCMENA,Falls in the cup of my calamity;
1126,ALCMENA,"While thoughts, such as you guess, are often here,"
1127,ALCMENA,Bringing a sweet temptation.
1128,ALCMENA,I have tried
1129,ALCMENA,"All means of remedy. This perfumed air,"
1130,ALCMENA,"This gold and ivory, these purple robes"
1131,ALCMENA,Have caused no change. The mute insistent hours
1132,ALCMENA,"Wait for me still, interminably slow."
1133,ALCMENA,"And, as in mental pain a man will crave"
1134,ALCMENA,For any fierce sensation of the flesh
1135,ALCMENA,"To rid his agony, so I have craved"
1136,ALCMENA,"The frenzied lashing of tempestuous rain,"
1137,ALCMENA,"The heat of flame, the sharpened fang of frost."
1138,ALCMENA,"I have gone forth at midnight with no robe,"
1139,ALCMENA,And walked bare-footed over stony ground
1140,ALCMENA,While wind and rain have done their worst on me.
1141,ALCMENA,
1142,ALCMENA,I have kissed flame and held these hands in fire;
1143,ALCMENA,"These hands have taken the scourge, that is for slaves,"
1144,ALCMENA,To beat my body. Hear then all my curse.
1145,ALCMENA,Neither the blade of sharp-projecting flint
1146,ALCMENA,Nor wind nor rain nor burning tongue of flame
1147,ALCMENA,Nor knotted scourge can leave a mark on me.
1148,ALCMENA,These lips are no less red since they were kissed
1149,ALCMENA,By glowing coal; these hands are yet untorn.
1150,ALCMENA,"Such is my fate, with flesh insensible"
1151,ALCMENA,To suffer from a mind which has no love
1152,ALCMENA,"And no distraction. Have it as you will,"
1153,ALCMENA,I am a shipwreck far on lonely seas
1154,ALCMENA,"With neither oars aboard, nor land in sight,"

1470,LIFE AND LUXURY,Of slothful scents and fingered at my throat;
1471,LIFE AND LUXURY,"But, brushing by them, unaccompanied"
1472,LIFE AND LUXURY,I held aloft my rushlight in the cave
1473,LIFE AND LUXURY,And searched for beauty through the cleaner air.
1474,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Thus far in parable. Laugh loud, O world,"
1475,LIFE AND LUXURY,Laugh loud and hollow. There are those would spurn
1476,LIFE AND LUXURY,Your joys unjoyous and your acid fruits.
1477,LIFE AND LUXURY,They would not tread the corpsy paths of commerce
1478,LIFE AND LUXURY,Nor juggle with men’s bones; they would not chaffer
1479,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Their souls for strumpet pleasure. Cast them out,"
1480,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Deny what little they would ask of life,"
1481,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Assail, starve, torture, murder them, and laugh."
1482,LIFE AND LUXURY,Shall it be war between us? Better war
1483,LIFE AND LUXURY,Than faint submission--better death. And yet
1484,LIFE AND LUXURY,"I would not, no, nor shall not die. How weaponed"
1485,LIFE AND LUXURY,Shall I go passionate against your host?
1486,LIFE AND LUXURY,"How, cautelous, elude your calm blockade?"
1487,LIFE AND LUXURY,
1488,LIFE AND LUXURY,Of older days heart-free the poet roved
1489,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Along the furrowed lanes, and watched the robin"
1490,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Squat in a puddle, whir his stumpy wings,"
1491,LIFE AND LUXURY,And tweet amid the tempest he aroused;
1492,LIFE AND LUXURY,"A hare would hirple on ahead (keep back,"
1493,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Let her get out of sight; quick, cross yourself),"
1494,LIFE AND LUXURY,Or taper weasel slink past over the road;
1495,LIFE AND LUXURY,"And, seeing native blossoms, breathing air"
1496,LIFE AND LUXURY,"From English hills, what recked the wanderer"
1497,LIFE AND LUXURY,That barons threw no penny to his song?
1498,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Should he be hungered, he would seek some rill"
1499,LIFE AND LUXURY,"And, scrambling down the hazel scarp, would walk"
1500,LIFE AND LUXURY,Wet-ankled up the stream until he found
1501,LIFE AND LUXURY,"A larger pool of cold, colourless water,"
1502,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Full two-foot deep, scooped out of solid stone"
1503,LIFE AND LUXURY,By a chuckling trickle spated after rains.
1504,LIFE AND LUXURY,"There he would rest upon the bank, while slowly"
1505,LIFE AND LUXURY,His fingers crept along the crannied rock.
1506,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Poor starveling belly!--No, that lower fissure,"
1507,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Straight, lipless grin like an unholy god’s,"
1508,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Reach out for that. The water stings to his armpit,"
1509,LIFE AND LUXURY,"He hangs above the pool from head to waist,"
1510,LIFE AND LUXURY,"His legs push tautly back for body’s poise,"
1511,LIFE AND LUXURY,"And careful, careful creep the sensitive fingers."
1512,LIFE AND LUXURY,
1513,LIFE AND LUXURY,"--Sudden touch of cold, wet silk."
1514,LIFE AND LUXURY,Now flesh be one with brain! He lightly strokes
1515,LIFE AND LUXURY,The slippery smoothness upward to the gills
1516,LIFE AND LUXURY,And throws a twiring trout upon the grass.
1517,LIFE AND LUXURY,Or where the rattle of the water slacks
1518,LIFE AND LUXURY,"To low leaf-whisper, there he gropes beneath"
1519,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Root-knots that hug black, unctuous mould from toppling"
1520,LIFE AND LUXURY,To slutch the daylit stream. His wary nerves
1521,LIFE AND LUXURY,Tell blunt teeth biting at his thumb. Stormswift
1522,LIFE AND LUXURY,He snatches a heavy hand over his head.
1523,LIFE AND LUXURY,"A floundering eel flops wildly to the floor,"
1524,LIFE AND LUXURY,And glides for the water. Quick the hungry poet
1525,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Spins round, whips out his knife, and shears the neck"
1526,LIFE AND LUXURY,"How firm soever gripped, the limber body"
1527,LIFE AND LUXURY,Long after wriggles headless out of hand.
1528,LIFE AND LUXURY,But if he roam across foot-tangling heath
1529,LIFE AND LUXURY,"And bracken, where no burble glads the root"
1530,LIFE AND LUXURY,Of juicy grasses? If along his way
1531,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Never a kingcup lifted bowls of light,"
1532,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Nor burly watermint with bludgeon scent,"
1533,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Beat down the fair, mild, slumbering meadowsweet?"
1534,LIFE AND LUXURY,If no nearby forgetmenot looks up
1535,LIFE AND LUXURY,"With frank and modest eye, no yellow flag"
1536,LIFE AND LUXURY,Plays Harold crowned and girt by fearless pikes?
1537,LIFE AND LUXURY,No more he fails of ample fare; nor famine
1538,LIFE AND LUXURY,Drains out his blood and piecemeal drags his flesh
1539,LIFE AND LUXURY,"From outward-leaping bones, till wrathful death,"
1540,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Grudging to lose a pebble from his cairn,"
1541,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Bears off the pitiful orts. For, stepping soft,"
1542,LIFE AND LUXURY,He finds a rabbit gazing at the world
1543,LIFE AND LUXURY,With eyes in which not many moons have gleamed;
1544,LIFE AND LUXURY,"And, raising a bawl of more expended breath"
1545,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Than fritter your burghers in a year of gabbling,"
1546,LIFE AND LUXURY,He runs and hurls himself headlong on to it.
1547,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Stunned at the cry, the rabbit waits and dithers;"
1548,LIFE AND LUXURY,"His muscles melt beneath him; ""Pluck up strength,"""
1549,LIFE AND LUXURY,"He calls to his legs; ""oh, stiffen, stiffen!"" and still"
1550,LIFE AND LUXURY,He waits and dithers. Now the trembling scale
1551,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Of timeless pain crashes suddenly down,"
1552,LIFE AND LUXURY,And life’s a puffed-out flame.
1553,LIFE AND LUXURY,
1554,LIFE AND LUXURY,Thus the poet
1555,LIFE AND LUXURY,Of bygone England (as an alchemist
1556,LIFE AND LUXURY,After ill magics and long labours wrought
1557,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Seals in the flask his magisterium,"
1558,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Lest volatile it waste among the winds,"
1559,LIFE AND LUXURY,And all men breathe a never-ageing youth)
1560,LIFE AND LUXURY,Found way to pend within his body life
1561,LIFE AND LUXURY,And what of pain or interwoven joy
1562,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Life brings to poets. Friend, I do not gulp"
1563,LIFE AND LUXURY,"And weep with maudlin, sentimental tears,"
1564,LIFE AND LUXURY,Lacking a late lamented golden age.
1565,LIFE AND LUXURY,"The more of life was ever misery’s,"
1566,LIFE AND LUXURY,And Socrates won hemlock. Yet before
1567,LIFE AND LUXURY,Was man so constant enemy to man?
1568,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Did earth grow bleak at all these purposeless,"
1569,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Rotting and blotting, roaking, smoking chimneys?"
1570,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Look, men are dying, women dying, children dying."
1571,LIFE AND LUXURY,"They sell their souls for bread, and poison-filths"
1572,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Whiten their flesh, bow their bodies. Crippled,"
1573,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Consumption-spotted, feeble-minded, sullen,"
1574,LIFE AND LUXURY,"They seek, bewildered, out of black despair,"
1575,LIFE AND LUXURY,"The star of life; so, dying a Christian death,"
1576,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Lie seven a grave unheedful. ""Bad as that?"
1577,LIFE AND LUXURY,Put down five hundred on the Lord Mayor’s list.
1578,LIFE AND LUXURY,After the cost of organizing’s paid
1579,LIFE AND LUXURY,"There’ll still be something left. Besides, it looks well,"
1580,LIFE AND LUXURY,And charity brings the firm new customers.
1581,LIFE AND LUXURY,Not that I hold with all this nonsense really.
1582,LIFE AND LUXURY,"When I was young I’d nothing more than they,"
1583,LIFE AND LUXURY,"But I climbed, and trampled other people down."
1584,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Why shouldn’t they?"" O murderers, look, look, look."
1585,LIFE AND LUXURY,"No man but tramples, tramples on his neighbour,"
1586,LIFE AND LUXURY,And these the lowest wrench and writhe and kick
1587,LIFE AND LUXURY,And crush the desperate lives of whom they can.
1588,LIFE AND LUXURY,I will not tread the corpsy path of commerce
1589,LIFE AND LUXURY,Nor juggle with men’s bones. The world shall wend
1590,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Those murderous ways. Not I, no, never I."
1591,LIFE AND LUXURY,You shall not gaol me round with city walls;
1592,LIFE AND LUXURY,I will not waste among your houses; roads
1593,LIFE AND LUXURY,That indiscriminate feel a thousand footings
1594,LIFE AND LUXURY,Shall not for mine augment their insolence.
1595,LIFE AND LUXURY,"But, as of old the poet, poet now"
1596,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Shall hold a near communion with earth,"
1597,LIFE AND LUXURY,Free from all traffic or truck with worldlihood:
1598,LIFE AND LUXURY,"As poet one time lived of natural bounty,"
1599,LIFE AND LUXURY,So now shall I. Yet differs even this.
1600,LIFE AND LUXURY,Me no man wronging still the world shall hound
1601,LIFE AND LUXURY,"With interdict of food. Gamekeepers, bailiffs,"
1602,LIFE AND LUXURY,And all the manlings vail and bob to lords
1603,LIFE AND LUXURY,Shall sturdy stand on decent English Law
1604,LIFE AND LUXURY,"And threat my famine with a worser fate,"
1605,LIFE AND LUXURY,The seasonless monotonies of walls
1606,LIFE AND LUXURY,That straitlier cabin than the closest town.
1607,LIFE AND LUXURY,So let them threat. War stands between us. I
1608,LIFE AND LUXURY,"Take peril comrade, knowing a hazel scarp"
1609,LIFE AND LUXURY,That breaks down ragged to a scampering brook;
