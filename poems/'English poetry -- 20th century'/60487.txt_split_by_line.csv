183,INTRODUCTION,
184,INTRODUCTION,
185,INTRODUCTION,Far from the poets being astray in prose-writing (said Francis
186,INTRODUCTION,"Thompson) it might plausibly be contended that English prose, as an"
187,INTRODUCTION,"art, is but a secondary stream of the Pierian fount, and owes its very"
188,INTRODUCTION,origin to the poets. The first writer one remembers with whom prose
189,INTRODUCTION,became an art was Sir Philip Sidney. And Sidney was a poet.
190,INTRODUCTION,
191,INTRODUCTION,"This quotation is relevant to a consideration of Hilaire Belloc,"
192,INTRODUCTION,because Belloc is a poet who happens to be known chiefly for his
193,INTRODUCTION,prose. His _Danton_ and _Robespierre_ have been read by every
194,INTRODUCTION,"intelligent student of French history, his _Path to Rome_, that most"
195,INTRODUCTION,"high-spirited and engaging of travel books, has passed through many"
196,INTRODUCTION,"editions, his political writings are known to all lovers--and many"
197,INTRODUCTION,"foes--of democracy, his whimsically imaginative novels have their"
198,INTRODUCTION,"large and appreciative audience, and his exquisite brief essays are"
199,INTRODUCTION,contemporary classics. And since the unforgetable month of August of
200,INTRODUCTION,"the unforgetable year 1914, Hilaire Belloc has added to the number"
201,INTRODUCTION,of his friends many thousands who care little for _belles lettres_
202,INTRODUCTION,and less for the French Revolution--he has become certainly the most
203,INTRODUCTION,"popular, and by general opinion the shrewdest and best informed, of all"
204,INTRODUCTION,chroniclers and critics of the Great War.
205,INTRODUCTION,
206,INTRODUCTION,"There is nothing, it may be said, about these achievements to indicate"
207,INTRODUCTION,the poet. How can this most public of publicists woo the shy and
208,INTRODUCTION,exacting Muse? His superabundant energy may now and again overflow in
209,INTRODUCTION,"little lyrical rivulets, but how can he find time to turn it into the"
210,INTRODUCTION,deep channels of song?
211,INTRODUCTION,
212,INTRODUCTION,"Well, what is the difference between a poet who writes prose and a"
213,INTRODUCTION,prose-writer who writes verse? The difference is easy to see but hard
214,INTRODUCTION,to describe. Mr. Thomas Hardy is a prose writer. He has forsaken the
215,INTRODUCTION,"novel, of which he was so distinguished a master, to make cynical"
216,INTRODUCTION,little sonnet portraits and to pour the acid wine of his philosophy--a
217,INTRODUCTION,sort of perverted Presbyterianism--into the graceful amphora of poetic
218,INTRODUCTION,"drama. But he is not a poet. Thackeray was a prose-writer, in spite of"
219,INTRODUCTION,"his delicious light verse. Every novelist writes or has written verse,"
220,INTRODUCTION,but not all of them are poets.
221,INTRODUCTION,
222,INTRODUCTION,"Of course, Sir Walter Scott was first of all a poet--the greatest poet"
223,INTRODUCTION,who ever wrote a novel. And no one who has read _Love in the Valley_
224,INTRODUCTION,can hesitate to give Meredith his proper title. Was Macaulay a poet? I
225,INTRODUCTION,think so--but perhaps I am in a hopeless minority in my belief that the
226,INTRODUCTION,author of _The Battle of Naseby_ and _The Lays of Ancient Rome_ was the
227,INTRODUCTION,last of the great English ballad makers.
228,INTRODUCTION,
229,INTRODUCTION,"But this general truth cannot, I think, honestly be denied; there have"
230,INTRODUCTION,been many great poets who have devoted most of their lives to writing
231,INTRODUCTION,prose. Some of them have died without discovering their neglected
232,INTRODUCTION,talent. I think that Walter Pater was one of these; much that is
233,INTRODUCTION,annoyingly subtle or annoyingly elaborate in his essays needs only
234,INTRODUCTION,rhyme and rhythm--the lovely accidents of poetry--to become graceful
235,INTRODUCTION,and appropriate. His famous description of the Mona Lisa is worthless
236,INTRODUCTION,if considered as a piece of serious æsthetic criticism. But it would
237,INTRODUCTION,make an admirable sonnet. And it is significant that Walter Pater’s two
238,INTRODUCTION,"greatest pupils--Lionel Johnson and Father Gerard Hopkins, S.J.,--found"
239,INTRODUCTION,"expression for their genius not in prose, the chosen medium of their"
240,INTRODUCTION,"“unforgetably most gracious friend,” but in verse."
241,INTRODUCTION,
242,INTRODUCTION,"From Walter Pater, that exquisite of letters, to the robust Hilaire"
243,INTRODUCTION,"Belloc may seem a long journey. But there is, I insist, this similarity"
244,INTRODUCTION,"between these contrasting writers, both are poets, and both are known"
245,INTRODUCTION,to fame by their prose.
246,INTRODUCTION,
247,INTRODUCTION,"For proof that Walter Pater was a poet, it is necessary only to"
248,INTRODUCTION,read his _Renaissance Studies_ or his interpretations--unsound but
249,INTRODUCTION,"fascinating--of the soul of ancient Greece. Often his essays, too"
250,INTRODUCTION,delicately accurate in phrasing or too heavily laden with golden
251,INTRODUCTION,"rhetoric, seem almost to cry aloud for the relief of rhyme and rhythm."
252,INTRODUCTION,
253,INTRODUCTION,"Now, Hilaire Belloc suggests in many of his prose sketches that he is"
254,INTRODUCTION,not using his true medium. I remember a brief essay on sleep which
255,INTRODUCTION,"appeared in _The New Witness_--or, as it was then called, _The Eye"
256,INTRODUCTION,"Witness_--several years ago, which was not so much a complete work in"
257,INTRODUCTION,"itself as it was a draft for a poem. It had the economy of phrase, the"
258,INTRODUCTION,"concentration of idea, which is proper to poetry."
259,INTRODUCTION,
260,INTRODUCTION,"But it is not necessary in the case of Hilaire Belloc, as it is in"
261,INTRODUCTION,"that of Walter Pater, to search pages of prose for proof that their"
262,INTRODUCTION,author is a poet. Now and then--all too seldom--the idea in this man’s
263,INTRODUCTION,"brain has insisted on its right, has scorned the proffered dress of"
264,INTRODUCTION,"prose, however fine of warp and woof, however stiff with rich verbal"
265,INTRODUCTION,"embroidery, and has demanded its rhymed and rhythmed wedding garments."
266,INTRODUCTION,"Therefore, for proof that Hilaire Belloc is a poet it is necessary only"
267,INTRODUCTION,to read his poetry.
268,INTRODUCTION,
269,INTRODUCTION,
270,II,II
271,II,
272,II,"Hilaire Belloc is a poet. Also he is a Frenchman, an Englishman,"
273,II,"an Oxford man, a Roman Catholic, a country gentleman, a soldier, a"
274,II,"democrat, and a practical journalist. He is always all these things."
275,II,
276,II,One sign that he is naturally a poet is that he is never deliberately a
277,II,poet. No one can imagine him writing a poem to order--even to his own
278,II,order. The poems knock at the door of his brain and demand to be let
279,II,"out. And he lets them out, carelessly enough, setting them comfortably"
280,II,down on paper simply because that is the treatment they desire. And
281,II,this happens to be the way all real poetry is made.
282,II,
283,II,Not that all verse makers work that way. There are men who come upon a
284,II,waterfall or mountain or an emotion and say: “Aha! here is something
285,II,out of which I can extract a poem!” And they sit down in front of that
286,II,waterfall or mountain or emotion and think up clever things to say
287,II,"about it. These things they put into metrical form, and the result they"
288,II,fondly call a poem.
289,II,
290,II,"There’s no harm in that. It’s good exercise for the mind, and of it"
291,II,comes much interesting verse. But it is not the way in which the sum of
292,II,the world’s literature is increased.
293,II,
294,II,"Could anything, for example, be less studied, be more clearly marked"
295,II,"with the stigmata of that noble spontaneity we call inspiration,"
296,II,"than the passionate, rushing, irresistible lines “To the Balliol Men"
297,II,Still in Africa”? Like Gilbert K. Chesterton and many another English
298,II,"democrat, Hilaire Belloc deeply resented his country’s war upon the"
299,II,Boers. Yet his heart went out to the friends of his university days
300,II,"who were fighting in Africa. They were fighting, he thought, in an"
301,II,"unjust cause; but they were his friends and they were, at any rate,"
302,II,fighting. And so he made something that seems (like all great writing)
303,II,an utterance rather than a composition; he put his love of war in
304,II,"general and his hatred of this war in particular, his devotion to"
305,II,Balliol and to the friends of his youth into one of the very few pieces
306,II,of genuine poetry which the Boer War produced. Nor has any of Oxford’s
307,II,much-sung colleges known praise more fit than this
308,II,
309,II,“House that armours a man
310,II,"With the eyes of a boy and the heart of a ranger,"
311,II,"And a laughing way in the teeth of the world,"
312,II,And a holy hunger and thirst for danger.”
313,II,
314,II,But perhaps a more typical example of Hilaire Belloc’s wanton genius is
315,II,"to be found not among those poems which are, throughout, the beautiful"
316,II,"expressions of beautiful impressions, but among those which are"
317,II,"careless, whimsical, colloquial. There is that delightful, but somewhat"
318,II,"exasperating _Dedicatory Ode_. Hilaire Belloc is talking--charmingly,"
319,II,"as is his custom--to some of his friends, who had belonged, in their"
320,II,"university days, to a youthful revolutionary organization called the"
321,II,"Republican Club. He happens to be talking in verse, for no particular"
322,II,reason except that it amuses him to talk in verse. He makes a number of
323,II,"excellent jokes, and enjoys them very much; his Pegasus is cantering"
324,II,"down the road at a jolly gait, when suddenly, to the amazement of"
325,II,"the spectators, it spreads out great golden wings and flashes like a"
326,II,meteor across the vault of heaven! We have been laughing at the droll
327,II,tragedy of the opium-smoking Uncle Paul; we have been enjoying the
328,II,humorous spectacle of the contemplative freshman--and suddenly we come
329,II,"upon a bit of astonishingly fine poetry. Who would expect, in all this"
330,II,"whimsical and jovial writing, to find this really great stanza?"
331,II,
332,II,"“From quiet homes and first beginning,"
333,II,Out to the undiscovered ends.
334,II,"There’s nothing worth the wear of winning,"
335,II,But laughter and the love of friends.”
336,II,
337,II,"Who having read these four lines, can forget them? And who but a poet"
338,II,could write them? But Hilaire Belloc has not forced himself into this
339,II,"high mood, nor does he bother to maintain it. He gaily passes on to"
340,II,"another verse of drollery, and then, not because he wishes to bring"
341,II,"the poem to an effective climax, but merely because it happens to"
342,II,"be his mood, he ends the escapade he calls an Ode with eight or ten"
343,II,stanzas of nobly beautiful poetry.
344,II,
345,II,There is something almost uncanny about the flashes of inspiration
346,II,which dart out at the astonished reader of Hilaire Belloc’s most
347,II,frivolous verses. Let me alter a famous epigram and call his light
348,II,verse a circus illuminated by lightning. There is that monumental
349,II,"burlesque, the Newdigate Poem--_A Prize Poem Submitted by Mr. Lambkin"
350,II,of Burford to the Examiners of the University of Oxford on the
351,II,"Prescribed Poetic Theme Set by Them in 1893, “The Benefits of the"
352,II,Electric Light.”_ It is a tremendous joke; with every line the reader
353,II,"echoes the author’s laughter. But without the slightest warning,"
354,II,Hilaire Belloc passes from the rollicking burlesque to shrewd satire;
355,II,"he has been merrily jesting with a bladder on a stick, he suddenly"
356,II,draws a gleaming rapier and thrusts it into the heart of error. He
357,II,makes Mr. Lambkin say:
358,II,
359,II,"“Life is a veil, its paths are dark and rough"
360,II,Only because we do not know enough:
361,II,When Science has discovered something more
362,II,We shall be happier than we were before.”
363,II,
364,II,Here we find the directness and restraint which belong to really great
365,II,"satire. This is the materialistic theory, the religion of Science,"
366,II,"not burlesqued, not parodied, but merely stated nakedly, without the"
367,II,verbal frills and furbelows with which our forward-looking leaders of
368,II,popular thought are accustomed to cover its obscene absurdity. Almost
369,II,these very words have been uttered in a dozen “rationalistic” pulpits
370,II,"I could mention, pulpits occupied by robustuous practical gentlemen"
371,II,"with very large eyes, great favourites with the women’s clubs. Their"
372,II,"pet doctrines, their only and most offensive dogma, is not attacked,"
373,II,"is not ridiculed; it is merely stated for them, in all kindness and"
374,II,"simplicity. They cannot answer it, they cannot deny that it is a"
375,II,mercilessly fair statement of the “philosophy” that is their stock in
376,II,trade. I hope that many of them will read it.
377,II,
378,II,
379,III,III
380,III,
381,III,"Hilaire Belloc was born July 27, 1870. He was educated at the Oratory"
382,III,"School, Edgbaston, and at Balliol College, Oxford. After leaving school"
383,III,he served as a driver in the Eighth Regiment of French Artillery at
384,III,"Toul Meurthe-et-Moselle, being at that time a French citizen. Later he"
385,III,"was naturalized as a British subject, and entered the House of Commons"
386,III,in 1906 as Liberal Member for South Salford. British politicians
387,III,will not soon forget the motion which Hilaire Belloc introduced one
388,III,"day in the early Spring of 1908, the motion that the Party funds,"
389,III,"hitherto secretly administered, be publicly audited. His vigorous"
390,III,"and persistent campaign against the party system has placed him,"
391,III,"with Cecil Chesterton, in the very front ranks of those to whom the"
392,III,democrats of Great Britain must look for leadership and inspiration.
393,III,"He was always a keen student of military affairs; he prophesied, long"
394,III,"before the event, the present international conflict, describing with"
395,III,astonishing accuracy the details of the German invasion of Belgium and
396,III,the resistance of Liège. Now he occupies a unique position among the
397,III,"journalists who comment upon the War, having tremendously increased the"
398,III,"circulation of _Land and Water_, the periodical for which he writes"
399,III,"regularly, and lecturing to a huge audience once a week on the events"
400,III,of the War in one of the largest of London’s concert halls--Queen’s
401,III,"Hall, where the same vast crowds that listen to the War lectures used"
402,III,to gather to hear the works of the foremost German composers.
403,III,
404,III,
405,IV,IV
406,IV,
407,IV,"Hilaire Belloc, as I have said, is a Frenchman, an Englishman,"
408,IV,"an Oxford man, a country gentleman, a soldier, a democrat, and a"
409,IV,practical journalist. In all these characters he utters his poetry. As
410,IV,"a Frenchman, he is vivacious and gallant and quick. He has the noble"
411,IV,"English frankness, and that broad irresistible English mirthfulness"
412,IV,"which is so much more inclusive than that narrow possession, a sense"
413,IV,"of humour. Democrat though he is, there is about him something of the"
414,IV,atmosphere of the country squire of some generations ago; it is in his
415,IV,"heartiness, his jovial dignity, his deep love of the land. The author"
416,IV,of _The South Country_ and _Courtesy_ has made Sussex his inalienable
417,IV,"possession; he owns Sussex, as Dickens owns London, and Blackmore owns"
418,IV,"Devonshire. And he is thoroughly a soldier, a happy warrior, as brave"
419,IV,"and dextrous, no one can doubt, with a sword of steel as with a sword"
420,IV,of words.
421,IV,
422,IV,He has taken the most severe risk which a poet can take: he has written
423,IV,poems about childhood. What happened when the late Algernon Charles
424,IV,Swinburne bent his energies to the task of celebrating this theme?
425,IV,"As the result of his solemn meditation on the mystery of childhood,"
426,IV,"he arrived at two conclusions, which he melodiously announced to the"
427,IV,"world. They were, first, that the face of a baby wearing a plush cap"
428,IV,"looks like a moss-rose bud in its soft sheath, and, second, that"
429,IV,"“astrolabe” rhymes with “babe.” Very charming, of course, but certainly"
430,IV,unworthy of a great poet. And upon this the obvious comment is that
431,IV,Swinburne was not a great poet. He took a theme terribly great and
432,IV,"terribly simple, and about it he wrote ... something rather pretty."
433,IV,
434,IV,"Now, when a really great poet--Francis Thompson, for example--has"
435,IV,"before him such a theme as childhood, he does not spend his time making"
436,IV,"far-fetched comparisons with moss-rose buds, or hunting for words that"
437,IV,"rhyme with “babe.” Childhood suggests Him Who made childhood sacred,"
438,IV,"so the poet writes _Ex Ore Infantium_, or such a poem as that which"
439,IV,ends with the line:
440,IV,
441,IV,“Look for me in the nurseries of Heaven.”
442,IV,
443,IV,"A poet may write pleasingly about mountains, and cyclones, and battles,"
444,IV,"and the love of woman, but if he is at all timid about the verdict of"
445,IV,posterity he should avoid the theme of childhood as he would avoid the
446,IV,plague. For only great poets can write about childhood poems worthy to
447,IV,be printed.
448,IV,
449,IV,"Hilaire Belloc has written poems about children, and they are worthy to"
450,IV,be printed. He is never ironic when he thinks about childhood; he is
451,IV,"gay, whimsical, with a slight suggestion of elfin cynicism, but he is"
452,IV,"direct, as a child is direct. He has written two dedicatory poems for"
453,IV,books to be given to children; they are slight things but they are a
454,IV,revelation of their author’s power to do what only a very few poets can
455,IV,"do, that is, to enter into the heart and mind of the child, following"
456,IV,"that advice which has its literary as well as moral significance, to"
457,IV,“become as a little child.”
458,IV,
459,IV,And in many of Hilaire Belloc’s poems by no means intended for
460,IV,childish audiences there is an appealing simplicity that is genuinely
461,IV,"and beautifully childish, something quite different from the adult and"
462,IV,highly artificial simplicity of Professor A. E. Housman’s _A Shropshire
463,IV,Lad_. Take that quatrain _The Early Morning_. It is as clear and cool
464,IV,as the time it celebrates; it is absolutely destitute of rhetorical
465,IV,"indulgence, poetical inversions or “literary” phrasing. It is, in"
466,IV,"fact, conversation--inspired conversation, which is poetry. It might"
467,IV,"have been written by a Wordsworth not painfully self-conscious, or"
468,IV,by a Blake whose brain was not as yet muddled with impressionistic
469,IV,metaphysics.
470,IV,
471,IV,And his Christmas carols--they are fit to be sung by a chorus of
472,IV,children. Can any songs of the sort receive higher praise than that?
473,IV,"Children, too, appreciate _The Birds_ and _Our Lord and Our Lady_. Nor"
474,IV,is that wonderful prayer rather flatly called _In a Boat_ beyond the
475,IV,reach of their intelligence.
476,IV,
477,IV,"Naturally enough, Hilaire Belloc is strongly drawn to the almost"
478,IV,violent simplicity of the ballad. Bishop Percy would not have enjoyed
479,IV,"the theological and political atmosphere of _The Little Serving Maid_,"
480,IV,but he would have acknowledged its irresistible charm. There is that
481,IV,wholly delightful poem _The Death and Last Confession of Wandering
482,IV,Peter_--a most Bellocian vagabond. “He wandered everywhere he would:
483,IV,"and all that he approved was sung, and most of what he saw was good.”"
484,IV,Says Peter:
485,IV,
486,IV,“If all that I have loved and seen
487,IV,"Be with me on the Judgment Day,"
488,IV,I shall be saved the crowd between
489,IV,From Satan and his foul array.”
490,IV,
491,IV,Hilaire Belloc has seen much and loved much. He has sung lustily the
492,IV,things he approved--with what hearty hatred has he sung the things he
493,IV,disapproved!
494,IV,
495,IV,
496,V,V
497,V,
498,V,Hilaire Belloc is not the man to spend much time in analysing his own
499,V,"emotions; he is not, thank God, a poetical psychologist. Love songs,"
500,V,"drinking songs, battle songs--it is with these primitive and democratic"
501,V,things that he is chiefly concerned.
502,V,
503,V,But there is something more democratic than wine or love or war. That
504,V,thing is Faith. And Hilaire Belloc’s part in increasing the sum of the
505,V,world’s beauty would not be the considerable thing that it is were it
506,V,not for his Faith. It is not that (like Dante Gabriel Rossetti) he is
507,V,attracted by the Church’s pageantry and wealth of legend. To Hilaire
508,V,"Belloc the pageantry is only incidental, the essential thing is his"
509,V,Catholic Faith. He writes convincingly about Our Lady and Saint Joseph
510,V,and the Child Jesus because he himself is convinced. He does not delve
511,V,"into mediæval tradition in quest of picturesque incidents, he merely"
512,V,writes what he knows to be true. His Faith furnishes him with the theme
513,V,for those of his poems which are most likely to endure; his Faith gives
514,V,"him the “rapture of an inspiration.” His Faith enables him, as it has"
515,V,"enabled many another poet, to see “in the lamp that is beauty, the"
516,V,light that is God.”
517,V,
518,V,And therein is Hilaire Belloc most thoroughly and consistently a
519,V,democrat. For in this twentieth century it happens that there is on
520,V,earth only one genuine democratic institution. And that institution is
521,V,the Catholic Church.

647,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,When I am living in the Midlands
648,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"That are sodden and unkind,"
649,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,I light my lamp in the evening:
650,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,My work is left behind;
651,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the great hills of the South Country
652,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Come back into my mind.
653,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
654,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,The great hills of the South Country
655,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,They stand along the sea;
656,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And it’s there walking in the high woods
657,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"That I could wish to be,"
658,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the men that were boys when I was a boy
659,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Walking along with me.
660,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
661,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,The men that live in North England
662,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,I saw them for a day:
663,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"Their hearts are set upon the waste fells,"
664,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Their skies are fast and grey;
665,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,From their castle-walls a man may see
666,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,The mountains far away.
667,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
668,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,The men that live in West England
669,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"They see the Severn strong,"
670,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,A-rolling on rough water brown
671,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Light aspen leaves along.
672,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"They have the secret of the Rocks,"
673,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the oldest kind of song.
674,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
675,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,But the men that live in the South Country
676,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"Are the kindest and most wise,"
677,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"They get their laughter from the loud surf,"
678,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the faith in their happy eyes
679,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Comes surely from our Sister the Spring
680,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,When over the sea she flies;
681,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"The violets suddenly bloom at her feet,"
682,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,She blesses us with surprise.
683,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
684,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,I never get between the pines
685,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,But I smell the Sussex air;
686,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Nor I never come on a belt of sand
687,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,But my home is there.
688,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And along the sky the line of the Downs
689,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,So noble and so bare.
690,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
691,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"A lost thing could I never find,"
692,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Nor a broken thing mend:
693,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And I fear I shall be all alone
694,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,When I get towards the end.
695,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Who will there be to comfort me
696,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Or who will be my friend?
697,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
698,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,I will gather and carefully make my friends
699,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"Of the men of the Sussex Weald,"
700,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"They watch the stars from silent folds,"
701,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,They stiffly plough the field.
702,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,By them and the God of the South Country
703,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,My poor soul shall be healed.
704,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
705,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"If I ever become a rich man,"
706,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"Or if ever I grow to be old,"
707,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,I will build a house with deep thatch
708,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"To shelter me from the cold,"
709,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And there shall the Sussex songs be sung
710,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the story of Sussex told.
711,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
712,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,I will hold my house in the high wood
713,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"Within a walk of the sea,"
714,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the men that were boys when I was a boy
715,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Shall sit and drink with me.

722,THE FANATIC,
723,THE FANATIC,"Last night in Compton Street, Soho,"
724,THE FANATIC,A man whom many of you know
725,THE FANATIC,Gave up the ghost at half past nine.
726,THE FANATIC,That evening he had been to dine
727,THE FANATIC,"At Gressington’s--an act unwise,"
728,THE FANATIC,But not the cause of his demise.
729,THE FANATIC,The doctors all agree that he
730,THE FANATIC,Was touched with cardiac atrophy
731,THE FANATIC,Accelerated (more or less)
732,THE FANATIC,"By lack of proper food, distress,"
733,THE FANATIC,"Uncleanliness, and loss of sleep."
734,THE FANATIC,He was a man that could not keep
735,THE FANATIC,His money (when he had the same)
736,THE FANATIC,Because of creditors who came
737,THE FANATIC,And took it from him; and he gave
738,THE FANATIC,So freely that he could not save.
739,THE FANATIC,But all the while a sort of whim
740,THE FANATIC,"Persistently remained with him,"
741,THE FANATIC,"Half admirable, half absurd:"
742,THE FANATIC,"To keep his word, to keep his word...."
743,THE FANATIC,By which he did not mean what you
744,THE FANATIC,And I would mean (of payments due
745,THE FANATIC,Or punctual rental of the Flat--
746,THE FANATIC,He was a deal too mad for that)
747,THE FANATIC,But--as he put it with a fine
748,THE FANATIC,"Abandon, foolish or divine--"
749,THE FANATIC,But “That great word which every man
750,THE FANATIC,Gave God before his life began.”
751,THE FANATIC,"It was a sacred word, he said,"
752,THE FANATIC,Which comforted the pathless dead
753,THE FANATIC,And made God smile when it was shown
754,THE FANATIC,"Unforfeited, before the Throne."
755,THE FANATIC,And this (he said) he meant to hold
756,THE FANATIC,"In spite of debt, and hate, and cold;"
757,THE FANATIC,And this (he said) he meant to show
758,THE FANATIC,As passport to the wards below.
759,THE FANATIC,He boasted of it and gave praise
760,THE FANATIC,To his own self through all his days.
761,THE FANATIC,He wrote a record to preserve
762,THE FANATIC,How steadfastly he did not swerve
763,THE FANATIC,From keeping it; how stiff he stood
764,THE FANATIC,"Its guardian, and maintained it good."
765,THE FANATIC,He had two witnesses to swear
766,THE FANATIC,He kept it once in Berkeley Square.
767,THE FANATIC,(Where hardly anything survives)
768,THE FANATIC,"And, through the loneliest of lives"
769,THE FANATIC,"He kept it clean, he kept it still,"
770,THE FANATIC,Down to the last extremes of ill.
771,THE FANATIC,"So when he died, of many friends"
772,THE FANATIC,Who came in crowds from all the ends
773,THE FANATIC,"Of London, that it might be known"
774,THE FANATIC,"They knew the man who died alone,"
775,THE FANATIC,"Some, who had thought his mood sublime"
776,THE FANATIC,"And sent him soup from time to time,"
777,THE FANATIC,"Said, “Well, you cannot make them fit"
778,THE FANATIC,"The world, and there’s an end of it!”"
779,THE FANATIC,"But others, wondering at him, said:"
780,THE FANATIC,“The man that kept his word is dead!”
781,THE FANATIC,"Then angrily, a certain third"
782,THE FANATIC,"Cried, “Gentlemen, he kept his word."
783,THE FANATIC,And as a man whom beasts surround
784,THE FANATIC,"Tumultuous, on a little mound"
785,THE FANATIC,"Stands Archer, for one dreadful hour,"
786,THE FANATIC,Because a Man is borne to Power--
787,THE FANATIC,"And still, to daunt the pack below,"
788,THE FANATIC,"Twangs the clear purpose of his bow,"
789,THE FANATIC,Till overwhelmed he dares to fall:
790,THE FANATIC,So stood this bulwark of us all.
791,THE FANATIC,He kept his word as none but he
792,THE FANATIC,"Could keep it, and as did not we."
793,THE FANATIC,And round him as he kept his word
794,THE FANATIC,"To-day’s diseased and faithless herd,"
795,THE FANATIC,"A moment loud, a moment strong,"
796,THE FANATIC,"But foul forever, rolled along.”"
