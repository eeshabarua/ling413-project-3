141,PROTHALAMION,
142,PROTHALAMION,When the evening came my love said to me:
143,PROTHALAMION,"Let us go into the garden now that the sky is cool,"
144,PROTHALAMION,"The garden of black hellebore and rosemary,"
145,PROTHALAMION,Where wild woodruff spills in a milky pool.
146,PROTHALAMION,
147,PROTHALAMION,"Low we passed in the twilight, for the wavering heat"
148,PROTHALAMION,"Of day had waned, and round that shaded plot"
149,PROTHALAMION,Of secret beauty the thickets clustered sweet:
150,PROTHALAMION,"Here is heaven, our hearts whispered, but our lips spake not."
151,PROTHALAMION,
152,PROTHALAMION,Between that old garden and seas of lazy foam
153,PROTHALAMION,Gloomy and beautiful alleys of trees arise
154,PROTHALAMION,"With spire of cypress and dreamy beechen dome,"
155,PROTHALAMION,So dark that our enchanted sight knew nothing but the skies
156,PROTHALAMION,
157,PROTHALAMION,"Veiled with soft air, drench’d in the roses’ musk"
158,PROTHALAMION,"Or the dusky, dark carnation’s breath of clove;"
159,PROTHALAMION,"No stars burned in their deeps, but through the dusk"
160,PROTHALAMION,"I saw my love’s eyes, and they were brimmed with love."
161,PROTHALAMION,
162,PROTHALAMION,"No star their secret ravished, no wasting moon"
163,PROTHALAMION,Mocked the sad transience of those eternal hours:
164,PROTHALAMION,"Only the soft, unseeing heaven of June,"
165,PROTHALAMION,"The ghosts of great trees, and the sleeping flowers."
166,PROTHALAMION,
167,PROTHALAMION,For doves that crooned in the leafy noonday now
168,PROTHALAMION,"Were silent; the night-jar sought his secret covers,"
169,PROTHALAMION,Nor even a mild sea-whisper moved a creaking bough--
170,PROTHALAMION,Was ever a silence deeper made for lovers?
171,PROTHALAMION,
172,PROTHALAMION,Was ever a moment meeter made for love?
173,PROTHALAMION,Beautiful are your closed lips beneath my kiss;
174,PROTHALAMION,And all your yielding sweetness beautiful--
175,PROTHALAMION,"Oh, never in all the world was such a night as this!"

183,TESTAMENT,"If I had died, and never seen the dawn"
184,TESTAMENT,"For which I hardly hoped, lighting this lawn"
185,TESTAMENT,"Of silvery grasses; if there had been no light,"
186,TESTAMENT,And last night merged into perpetual night;
187,TESTAMENT,I doubt if I should ever have been content
188,TESTAMENT,To have closed my eyes without some testament
189,TESTAMENT,To the great benefits that marked my faring
190,TESTAMENT,Through the sweet world; for all my joy was sharing
191,TESTAMENT,And lonely pleasures were few.  Unto which end
192,TESTAMENT,"Three legacies I’ll send,"
193,TESTAMENT,"Three legacies, already half possess’d:"
194,TESTAMENT,"One to a friend, of all good friends the best,"
195,TESTAMENT,Better than which is nothing; yet another
196,TESTAMENT,"Unto thy twin, dissimilar spirit, Brother;"
197,TESTAMENT,"The third to you,"
198,TESTAMENT,"Most beautiful, most true,"
199,TESTAMENT,"Most perfect one, to whom they all are due."
200,TESTAMENT,
201,TESTAMENT,"Quick, quick ... while there is time...."
202,TESTAMENT,"O best of friends, I leave you one sublime"
203,TESTAMENT,"Summer, one fadeless summer.  ’Twas begun"
204,TESTAMENT,"Ere Cotswold hawthorn tarnished in the sun,"
205,TESTAMENT,"When hedges were fledged with green, and early swallows"
206,TESTAMENT,"Swift-darting, on curved wings, pillaged the fallows;"
207,TESTAMENT,"When all our vale was dappled blossom and light,"
208,TESTAMENT,"And oh, the scent of beanfields in the night!"
209,TESTAMENT,You shall remember that rich dust at even
210,TESTAMENT,"Which made old Evesham like a street in heaven,"
211,TESTAMENT,"Gold-paved, and washed within a wave of golden"
212,TESTAMENT,Air all her dreamy towers and gables olden.
213,TESTAMENT,You shall remember
214,TESTAMENT,"How arms sun-blistered, hot palms crack’d with rowing,"
215,TESTAMENT,"Clove the cool water of Avon, sweetly flowing;"
216,TESTAMENT,"And how our bodies, beautifully white,"
217,TESTAMENT,"Stretch’d to a long stroke lengthened in green light,"
218,TESTAMENT,"And we, emerging, laughed in childish wise,"
219,TESTAMENT,And pressed the kissing water from our eyes.
220,TESTAMENT,"Ah, was our laughter childish, or were we wise?"
221,TESTAMENT,"And then, crown of the day, a tired returning"
222,TESTAMENT,"With happy sunsets over Bredon burning,"
223,TESTAMENT,"With music and with moonlight, and good ale,"
224,TESTAMENT,And no thought for the morrow....  Heavy phlox
225,TESTAMENT,"Our garden pathways bordered, and evening stocks,"
226,TESTAMENT,"Those humble weeds, in sunlight withered and pale,"
227,TESTAMENT,"With a night scent to match the nightingale,"
228,TESTAMENT,"Gladdened with spicèd sweetness sweet night’s shadows,"
229,TESTAMENT,Meeting the breath of hay from mowing meadows:
230,TESTAMENT,"As humble was our joy, and as intense"
231,TESTAMENT,"Our rapture.  So, before I hurry hence,"
232,TESTAMENT,Yours be the memory.
233,TESTAMENT,"One night again,"
234,TESTAMENT,"When we were men, and had striven, and known pain,"
235,TESTAMENT,"By a dark canal debating, unresigned,"
236,TESTAMENT,"On the blind fate that shadows humankind,"
237,TESTAMENT,On the blind sword that severs human love...
238,TESTAMENT,Then did the hidden belfry from above
239,TESTAMENT,On troubled minds in benediction shed
240,TESTAMENT,The patience of the great anonymous dead
241,TESTAMENT,"Who reared those towers, those high cathedrals builded"
242,TESTAMENT,"In solemn stone, and with clear fancy gilded"
243,TESTAMENT,"A beauty beyond ours, trusting in God."
244,TESTAMENT,"Then dared we follow the dark way they trod,"
245,TESTAMENT,And bowing to the universal plan
246,TESTAMENT,Trust in the true and fiery spirit of Man.
247,TESTAMENT,
248,TESTAMENT,"And you, my Brother,"
249,TESTAMENT,"You know, as knows one other,"
250,TESTAMENT,How my spirit revisiteth a room
251,TESTAMENT,"In a high wing, beneath pine-trees, where gloom"
252,TESTAMENT,"Dwelleth, dispelled by resinous wood embers,"
253,TESTAMENT,"Where, in half-darkness ... How the heart remembers..."
254,TESTAMENT,"We talked of beauty, and those fiery things"
255,TESTAMENT,"To which the divine desirous spirit clings,"
256,TESTAMENT,"In a wing’d rapture to that heaven flinging,"
257,TESTAMENT,"Where beauty is an easy thing, and singing"
258,TESTAMENT,The natural speech of man.  Like kissing swords
259,TESTAMENT,Our wits clashed there; the brittle beauty of words
260,TESTAMENT,"Breaking, seemed to discover its secret heart"
261,TESTAMENT,And all the rapt elusiveness of Art.
262,TESTAMENT,"Now I have known sorrow, and now I sing"
263,TESTAMENT,That a lovely word is not an idle thing;
264,TESTAMENT,"For as with stars the cloth of night is spangled,"
265,TESTAMENT,"With star-like words, most lovelily entangled,"
266,TESTAMENT,"The woof of sombre thought is deckt....  Ah, bright"
267,TESTAMENT,And cold they glitter in the spirit’s night!
268,TESTAMENT,But neither distant nor dispassionate;
269,TESTAMENT,For beauty is an armour against fate....
270,TESTAMENT,"I tell you, who have stood in the dark alone."
271,TESTAMENT,"Seeing the face that turneth all to stone,"
272,TESTAMENT,"Medusa, blind with hate,"
273,TESTAMENT,"While I was dying, Beauty sate with me"
274,TESTAMENT,Nor tortured any longer; gracious was she;
275,TESTAMENT,"To her soft words I listened, and was content"
276,TESTAMENT,"To die, nor sorry that my light was spent."
277,TESTAMENT,"So, Brother, if I come not home,"
278,TESTAMENT,Go to that little room
279,TESTAMENT,"That my spirit revisiteth, and there,"
280,TESTAMENT,"Somewhere in the blue air, you shall discover"
281,TESTAMENT,If that you be a lover
282,TESTAMENT,"Nor haughtily minded, all that once half-shaped"
283,TESTAMENT,"Then fled us, and escaped:"
284,TESTAMENT,"All that I found that day,"
285,TESTAMENT,"Far, so far away."
286,TESTAMENT,
287,TESTAMENT,"And you, my lovely one,"
288,TESTAMENT,"What can I leave to you, who, you having left,"
289,TESTAMENT,Am utterly bereft?
290,TESTAMENT,What in my store of visionary dowers
291,TESTAMENT,Is not already yours?
292,TESTAMENT,"What silences, what hours"
293,TESTAMENT,Of peace passing all understanding; days
294,TESTAMENT,Made lyric by your beauty and its praise;
295,TESTAMENT,"Years neither time can tarnish, nor death mar,"
296,TESTAMENT,Wherein you shined as steadfast as a star
297,TESTAMENT,"In my bleak night, heedless of the cloud-wrack"
298,TESTAMENT,Scudding in torn fleeces black
299,TESTAMENT,"Of my dark moods, as those who rule the far"
300,TESTAMENT,Star-haunted pleasaunces of heaven are?
301,TESTAMENT,So think but lightly of that afternoon
302,TESTAMENT,With white clouds climbing a blue sky in June
303,TESTAMENT,"When a boy worshipped under dreaming trees,"
304,TESTAMENT,"Who touched your hand, and sought your eyes."
305,TESTAMENT,"... Ah, cease,"
306,TESTAMENT,"Not these, not these..."
307,TESTAMENT,Nor yet those nights when icy Brathay thundered
308,TESTAMENT,"Under his bridges, and ghostly mountains wondered"
309,TESTAMENT,At the white blossoming of a Christmas rose
310,TESTAMENT,More stainless than their snows;
311,TESTAMENT,Nor even of those placid days together
312,TESTAMENT,Mellow as early autumn’s amber weather
313,TESTAMENT,"When beech is ankleted with fire, and old"
314,TESTAMENT,"Elms wear their livery of yellow gold,"
315,TESTAMENT,"When orchards all are laden with increase,"
316,TESTAMENT,"And the quiet earth hath fruited, and knows peace"
317,TESTAMENT,"Oh, think not overmuch on those sweet years"
318,TESTAMENT,"Lest their last fruit be tears,--"
319,TESTAMENT,"Your tears, beloved, that were my utmost pain,--"
320,TESTAMENT,"But rather, dream again"
321,TESTAMENT,"How that a lover, half poet and half child,"
322,TESTAMENT,An eager spirit of fragile fancies wild
323,TESTAMENT,"Compact, adored the beauty and truth in you:"
324,TESTAMENT,To your own truth be true;
325,TESTAMENT,"And when, not mournfully, you turn this page"
326,TESTAMENT,"Consider still your starry heritage,"
327,TESTAMENT,"Continue in your loveliness, a star"
328,TESTAMENT,To gladden me from afar
329,TESTAMENT,Even where there is no light
330,TESTAMENT,In my last night.

338,LOCHANILAUN,This is the image of my last content:
339,LOCHANILAUN,"My soul shall be a little lonely lake,"
340,LOCHANILAUN,So hidden that no shadow of man may break
341,LOCHANILAUN,The folding of its mountain battlement;
342,LOCHANILAUN,Only the beautiful and innocent
343,LOCHANILAUN,Whiteness of sea-born cloud drooping to shake
344,LOCHANILAUN,"Cool rain upon the reed-beds, or the wake"
345,LOCHANILAUN,Of churn’d cloud in a howling wind’s descent.
346,LOCHANILAUN,For there shall be no terror in the night
347,LOCHANILAUN,"When stars that I have loved are born in me,"
348,LOCHANILAUN,And cloudy darkness I will hold most fair;
349,LOCHANILAUN,But this shall be the end of my delight:
350,LOCHANILAUN,"That you, my lovely one, may stoop and see"
351,LOCHANILAUN,Your image in the mirrored beauty there.

359,LETTERMORE,These winter days on Lettermore
360,LETTERMORE,"The brown west wind it sweeps the bay,"
361,LETTERMORE,And icy rain beats on the bare
362,LETTERMORE,Unhomely fields that perish there:
363,LETTERMORE,The stony fields of Lettermore
364,LETTERMORE,That drink the white Atlantic spray.
365,LETTERMORE,
366,LETTERMORE,"And men who starve on Lettermore,"
367,LETTERMORE,"Cursing the haggard, hungry surf,"
368,LETTERMORE,Will souse the autumn’s bruisèd grains
369,LETTERMORE,To light dark fires within their brains
370,LETTERMORE,And fight with stones on Lettermore
371,LETTERMORE,Or sprawl beside the smoky turf.
372,LETTERMORE,
373,LETTERMORE,When spring blows over Lettermore
374,LETTERMORE,"To bloom the ragged furze with gold,"
375,LETTERMORE,The lovely south wind’s living breath
376,LETTERMORE,Is laden with the smell of death:
377,LETTERMORE,For fever breeds on Lettermore
378,LETTERMORE,To waste the eyes of young and old.
379,LETTERMORE,
380,LETTERMORE,A black van comes to Lettermore;
381,LETTERMORE,"The horses stumble on the stones,"
382,LETTERMORE,"The drivers curse,--for it is hard"
383,LETTERMORE,To cross the hills from Oughterard
384,LETTERMORE,And cart the sick from Lettermore:
385,LETTERMORE,A stinking load of rags and bones.
386,LETTERMORE,
387,LETTERMORE,But you will go to Lettermore
388,LETTERMORE,"When white sea-trout are on the run,"
389,LETTERMORE,When purple glows between the rocks
390,LETTERMORE,About Lord Dudley’s fishing-box
391,LETTERMORE,"Adown the road to Lettermore,"
392,LETTERMORE,And wide seas tarnish in the sun.
393,LETTERMORE,
394,LETTERMORE,And so you’ll think of Lettermore
395,LETTERMORE,As a lost island of the blest:
396,LETTERMORE,With peasant lovers in a blue
397,LETTERMORE,"Dim dusk, with heather drench’d in dew,"
398,LETTERMORE,And the sweet peace of Lettermore
399,LETTERMORE,Remote and dreaming in the West.

408,LAMENT,"Touched my lips, and then I sang"
409,LAMENT,Half the songs of my desire:
410,LAMENT,With their splendour the world rang.
411,LAMENT,
412,LAMENT,And their sweetness made me free
413,LAMENT,Of those starry ways whereby
414,LAMENT,Planets make their minstrelsy
415,LAMENT,"In echoing, unending sky."
416,LAMENT,
417,LAMENT,"So, before that spell was broken,"
418,LAMENT,"Song of the wind, surge of the sea,--"
419,LAMENT,Beautiful passionate things unspoken
420,LAMENT,Rose like a breaking wave in me:
421,LAMENT,
422,LAMENT,Rose like a wave with curled crest
423,LAMENT,That green sunlight splinters through...
424,LAMENT,But the wave broke within my breast:
425,LAMENT,And now I am a man like you.

433,THE LEMON-TREE,"Last night, last night, a vision of you"
434,THE LEMON-TREE,Sweetly troubled my waking dream:
435,THE LEMON-TREE,Beneath the clear Algerian blue
436,THE LEMON-TREE,You stood with lifted eyes: the beam
437,THE LEMON-TREE,Of a winter sun beat on the crown
438,THE LEMON-TREE,"Of a lemon-tree, whose delicate fruit"
439,THE LEMON-TREE,Like pale lamps hung airily down;
440,THE LEMON-TREE,And in your gazing eyes a mute
441,THE LEMON-TREE,And lovely wonder....  Have I sung
442,THE LEMON-TREE,Of slender things and naught beside?
443,THE LEMON-TREE,You were so beautifully young
444,THE LEMON-TREE,I must have kissed you or have died.

451,PHTHONOS,"If, in high jealousy, God made me blind"
452,PHTHONOS,"And laughed to see me stumble in the night,"
453,PHTHONOS,Driving his many-splintered arrows of light
454,PHTHONOS,Into that lost dominion of my mind;
455,PHTHONOS,"Then, knowing me still unvext and unresigned,"
456,PHTHONOS,Stole from my ears all homely sounds that might
457,PHTHONOS,"Temper the darkness, saying, in heaven’s despite,"
458,PHTHONOS,I had not wholly left the world behind;
459,PHTHONOS,"So, sunless, soundless, if, to make an end,"
460,PHTHONOS,"He smote the nerves that move, the nerves that feel:"
461,PHTHONOS,"Even then, O jealous one, I would not complain"
462,PHTHONOS,"If I were spared the wealth I cannot spend,"
463,PHTHONOS,If I were left the treasure none can steal:
464,PHTHONOS,The lovely words that wander through my brain.

472,EASTER,Adown our lane at Eastertide
473,EASTER,Hosts of dancing bluebells lay
474,EASTER,"In pools of light: and ’Oh,’ you cried,"
475,EASTER,"’Look, look at them: I think that they"
476,EASTER,"Are bluer than the laughing sea,’"
477,EASTER,"And ’Look!’ you cried, ’a piece of the sky"
478,EASTER,Has fallen down for you and me
479,EASTER,"To gaze upon and love.’ ... And I,"
480,EASTER,Seeing in your eyes the dancing blue

490,THE LEANING ELM,
491,THE LEANING ELM,"Before my window, in days of winter hoar"
492,THE LEANING ELM,Huddled a mournful wood:
493,THE LEANING ELM,"Smooth pillars of beech, domed chestnut, sycamore,"
494,THE LEANING ELM,In stony sleep they stood:
495,THE LEANING ELM,"But you, unhappy elm, the angry west"
496,THE LEANING ELM,"Had chosen from the rest,"
497,THE LEANING ELM,"Flung broken on your brothers’ branches bare,"
498,THE LEANING ELM,And left you leaning there
499,THE LEANING ELM,So dead that when the breath of winter cast
500,THE LEANING ELM,"Wild snow upon the blast,"
501,THE LEANING ELM,"The other living branches, downward bowed,"
502,THE LEANING ELM,Shook free their crystal shroud
503,THE LEANING ELM,"And shed upon your blackened trunk beneath,"
504,THE LEANING ELM,Their livery of death....
505,THE LEANING ELM,
506,THE LEANING ELM,On windless nights between the beechen bars
507,THE LEANING ELM,I watched cold stars
508,THE LEANING ELM,"Throb whitely in the sky, and dreamily"
509,THE LEANING ELM,Wondered if any life lay locked in thee:
510,THE LEANING ELM,"If still the hidden sap secretly moved,"
511,THE LEANING ELM,As water in the icy winterbourne
512,THE LEANING ELM,Floweth unheard;
513,THE LEANING ELM,And half I pitied you your trance forlorn:
514,THE LEANING ELM,"You could not hear, I thought, the voice of any bird,"
515,THE LEANING ELM,The shadowy cries of bats in dim twilight
516,THE LEANING ELM,Or cool voices of owls crying by night....
517,THE LEANING ELM,Hunting by night under the hornèd moon:
518,THE LEANING ELM,"Yet half I envied you your wintry swoon,"
519,THE LEANING ELM,"Till, on this morning mild, the sun, new-risen"
520,THE LEANING ELM,Steals from his misty prison;
521,THE LEANING ELM,
522,THE LEANING ELM,"The frozen fallows glow, the black trees shaken"
523,THE LEANING ELM,In a clear flood of sunlight vibrating awaken:
524,THE LEANING ELM,"And lo, your ravaged bole, beyond belief"
525,THE LEANING ELM,Slenderly fledged anew with tender leaf
526,THE LEANING ELM,As pale as those twin vanes that break at last
527,THE LEANING ELM,In a tiny fan above the black beech-mast
528,THE LEANING ELM,Where no blade springeth green
529,THE LEANING ELM,But pallid bells of the shy helleborine.
530,THE LEANING ELM,What is this ecstasy that overwhelms
531,THE LEANING ELM,"The dreaming earth?  See, the embrownèd elms"
532,THE LEANING ELM,Crowding purple distances warm the depths of the wood;
533,THE LEANING ELM,"A new-born wind tosses their tassels brown,"
534,THE LEANING ELM,His white clouds dapple the down;
535,THE LEANING ELM,Into a green flame bursting the hedgerows stand;
536,THE LEANING ELM,"Soon, with banners flying, Spring will walk the land...."
537,THE LEANING ELM,
538,THE LEANING ELM,"There is no day for thee, my soul, like this,"
539,THE LEANING ELM,"No spring of lovely words.  Nay, even the kiss"
540,THE LEANING ELM,Of mortal love that maketh man divine
541,THE LEANING ELM,This light cannot outshine:
542,THE LEANING ELM,"Nay, even poets, they whose frail hands catch"
543,THE LEANING ELM,"The shadow of vanishing beauty, may not match"
544,THE LEANING ELM,This leafy ecstasy.  Sweet words may cull
545,THE LEANING ELM,Such magical beauty as time may not destroy;
546,THE LEANING ELM,"But we, alas, are not more beautiful:"
547,THE LEANING ELM,We cannot flower in beauty as in joy.
548,THE LEANING ELM,"We sing, our musèd words are sped, and then"
549,THE LEANING ELM,Poets are only men
550,THE LEANING ELM,"Who age, and toil, and sicken....  This maim’d tree"
551,THE LEANING ELM,May stand in leaf when I have ceased to be.

579,THE JOYOUS LOVER,But if I come to the dark room
580,THE JOYOUS LOVER,From which our love hath fled
581,THE JOYOUS LOVER,And bend above you in the gloom
582,THE JOYOUS LOVER,"Or kneel beside your bed,"

898,THE RAIN-BIRD,Over the mowing grass in June--
899,THE RAIN-BIRD,
900,THE RAIN-BIRD,"Over the mowing grass, and meadows"
901,THE RAIN-BIRD,Where the low sun casts long shadows.
902,THE RAIN-BIRD,And cuckoos call in the twilight
903,THE RAIN-BIRD,"From elm to elm, in level flight."
904,THE RAIN-BIRD,

906,THE RAIN-BIRD,"Slow couples of young folk in love,"

908,THE RAIN-BIRD,And kiss in the hawthorn’s shade the while:

911,THE RAIN-BIRD,"Hover between the beds of phlox,"

948,MOTHS,"When no leaf trembleth nor branch is stirred,"
949,MOTHS,"More silent in flight than any bird,"

952,MOTHS,They came quietly from aloft
953,MOTHS,"Down through my circle of light, and so"
954,MOTHS,Into unlighted gloom below.
955,MOTHS,"But one dream, strong-winged, daring"
956,MOTHS,Flew beating at the heart of the flame
957,MOTHS,"Till I feared it would have put out my light,"
958,MOTHS,"My thin taper, fitfully flaring,"
959,MOTHS,And that I should be left alone in the night
960,MOTHS,With no more dreams for my delight.

1099,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,With heavy gait they dragged the stretcher in

1101,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,"Of Maxim fire ceased not.  I raised his head,"
1102,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,"And looked into his face,"
1103,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,And saw that he was dead.
1104,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,Saw beneath matted curls the broken skin
1105,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,That let the bullet in;
1106,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,"And saw the limp, lithe limbs, the smiling mouth..."

1155,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,And hid her face of dread....
1156,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,"Yet, in my passion would I look on her,"
1157,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,"Crying, O hark,"
1158,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,"Thou pale one, whom now men say bearest the scythe"
1159,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,"Of God, that iron scythe forged by his thunder"

1171,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,Why must thou ride again
1172,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,"Ruthless among the pastures yet unripened,"
1173,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,Crushing their beauty in thine iron track

1176,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,"But she, she stayed not in her weary haste"
1177,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,Nor turned her face; but fled:
1178,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,And where she passed the lands lay waste....
1179,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,
1180,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,And now I cannot tell whither she rideth:

1182,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,Yet know I well why her dread face she hideth:
1183,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,"She is pale and faint to death.  Yea, her day faileth,"
1184,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,"Nor all her blood, nor all her frenzy burning,"
1185,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,Nor all her hate availeth:
1186,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,For she passeth out of sight
1187,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,Into that night
1188,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,"From which none, none returneth"
1189,ON A SUBALTERN KILLED IN ACTION,"To waste the meadows of youth,"

1665,THAMAR,And gazed into my eyes as he had wrongs to speak.

1690,THAMAR,"Like a baked stone, burning hot, plunged in a hissing pot."
1691,THAMAR,"Out of that solemn portal over the tawny waste,"
1692,THAMAR,"Without stay, without haste, nor the joy of any mortal"

1696,THAMAR,"Drawn to a hidden goal, sore, forlorn with waiting,"
1697,THAMAR,"Seeking I knew not what, yet unhesitating"

1699,THAMAR,"There, in a thousand springs,"
1700,THAMAR,"Slow, beneath frozen snow, where the blind earth lay cringing,"
1701,THAMAR,"Have I seen the steppe unfold uncounted blossomings,"
1702,THAMAR,Where salty pools shone fair in a quivering blue air
1703,THAMAR,"That shivered every fringing reed-bed with cool delight,"
1704,THAMAR,And fanned the mazy flight of slow-wing’d egrets white
1705,THAMAR,Beating and wheeling bright against the sun astare;
1706,THAMAR,But I could not hear their wings for they were ghostly things
1707,THAMAR,Sent by the powers of night to mock my sufferings
1708,THAMAR,And rain upon the bitter waterpools their drops aglitter.
1709,THAMAR,"Yet, when these lakes accursed tortured my aching thirst,"
1710,THAMAR,"The green reeds fell to dust, the cool pools to a crust"
1711,THAMAR,"Of frozen salt crystallised to taunt my broken lips,"
1712,THAMAR,"To cheat my staring eyes, as a vision of great ships"
1713,THAMAR,"With moving towers of sail, poops throng’d with grinning crowds"
1714,THAMAR,"And a wind in their shrouds, bears down upon the pale"
1715,THAMAR,Wasted castaway afloat with the salt in his throat
1716,THAMAR,And a feeble wild desire to be quenched of his fire
1717,THAMAR,In the green gloom beneath.
1718,THAMAR,"So, again and again,"
1719,THAMAR,Hath a phantom city thrust to the visionary vault
1720,THAMAR,"Of inviolate cobalt, dome and dreaming minaret"
1721,THAMAR,Mosque and gleaming water-tower hazy in a fountain’s jet
1722,THAMAR,Or a market’s rising dust; and my lips have cried aloud
1723,THAMAR,"To see them tremble there, though I knew within my heart"
1724,THAMAR,They were chiselled out of cloud or carven of thin air;
1725,THAMAR,"And my fingers clenched my hand, for I wondered if this land"
1726,THAMAR,"Of my stony pilgrimage were a glimmering mirage,"
1727,THAMAR,And I myself no more than a phantom of the sand.
1728,THAMAR,"’But beyond these fading slender cities, many leagues away,"
1729,THAMAR,"Strange brooding mountains lay heaped, crowding range on range"
1730,THAMAR,"In a changing cloudy splendour; and beyond, in lakes of light,"
1731,THAMAR,"As eastward still I staggered, there swam into my sight,"
1732,THAMAR,"More vast and hoar and haggard, shoulders of ice and snow"
1733,THAMAR,"Bounding the heavens low of burnished brass, whereunder"
1734,THAMAR,The hot plains of Cathay perpetually slumber:
1735,THAMAR,"Where tawny millions breed in cities without number,"
1736,THAMAR,"Whither, a hill-born thunder, rolling on Tartary"
1737,THAMAR,"With torrents and barb’d lightning, swelleth the yellow river"
1738,THAMAR,To a tumult of whitening foam and confusèd might
1739,THAMAR,That drowns in a single night many a mud-made city;
1740,THAMAR,"And cities of boats, and frail cities of lath and reed,"
1741,THAMAR,"Are whirled away without pity or set afloat in a pale,"
1742,THAMAR,"Swirling, shallow sea ... and their names seem lost for ever"
1743,THAMAR,Till a stranger nomad race drive their herds to the sad place
1744,THAMAR,"Where old sorrows lie forgotten, and raise upon the rotten"
1745,THAMAR,Level waste another brood to await another flood.
1746,THAMAR,’But I never might attain to this melancholy plain
1747,THAMAR,For the mountains rose between; stark in my path they lay
1748,THAMAR,"Between me and Cathay, through moving mist half-seen."
1749,THAMAR,"And I knew that they were real, for their drooping folds of cloud"
1750,THAMAR,"Enwrapped me in a shroud, and the air that fell at night"
1751,THAMAR,From their frozen summits white slid like an ice-blue steel
1752,THAMAR,Into my living breast and stilled the heart within
1753,THAMAR,"As the chill of an old sin that robs a man of rest,"
1754,THAMAR,Killing all delight in the silence of the night
1755,THAMAR,And brooding black above till the heart dare not move
1756,THAMAR,But lieth cold and numb ... and the dawn will not come.
1757,THAMAR,"’Yet to me a dawn came, new-kindled in cold flame,"
1758,THAMAR,Flinging the imminence of those inviolate snows
1759,THAMAR,On the forest lawns below in a shadow more immense
1760,THAMAR,"Than their eternal vastness; and a new hope beyond reason,"
1761,THAMAR,"Flamed in my heart’s dark season, dazzled my pallid eyes,"
1762,THAMAR,"Till, when the hot sun soared above the uttermost height,"
1763,THAMAR,"A draught of keen delight into my body was poured,"
1764,THAMAR,For all that frozen fastness lay flowered with the spring:
1765,THAMAR,"Her starry blossoms broke beneath my bruisèd feet,"
1766,THAMAR,And their beauty was so sweet to me I kissed them where they lay;
1767,THAMAR,"Yea, I bent my weary hips and kissed them with dry lips,"
1768,THAMAR,"Tenderly, only dreading lest their petals delicate"
1769,THAMAR,"Should be broken by my treading, for I lived, I lived again,"
1770,THAMAR,"And my heart would have been broken by a living creature’s pain,"
1771,THAMAR,"So I kissed them for a token of my joy in their new birth,"
1772,THAMAR,And I kissed the gentle earth.  Slowly the shadows crept
1773,THAMAR,"To the bases of the crags, and I slept...."
1774,THAMAR,"’Once, in another life, had I remembered sleep,"
1775,THAMAR,"When tired children creep on to their mother’s knees,"
1776,THAMAR,And there a dreamless peace more quietly descendeth
1777,THAMAR,"Than gentle evening endeth or ring-doves fold their wings,"
1778,THAMAR,Before the nightjar spins or the nightingale begins;
1779,THAMAR,When the brooding hedgerow trees where they nest lie awake
1780,THAMAR,And breathe so soft they shake not a single shuddering leaf
1781,THAMAR,Lest the silence should break.
1782,THAMAR,"’Other sleep have I known,"
1783,THAMAR,"Deeper, beyond belief, when straining limbs relax"
1784,THAMAR,After hot human toil in yellow harvest fields
1785,THAMAR,"Where the panting earth yields a smell of baked soil,"
1786,THAMAR,And the dust of dry stubbles blows over the whitening
1787,THAMAR,"Shocks of lank grain and bundles of flax,"
1788,THAMAR,"And men fling themselves down forgetting their troubles,"
1789,THAMAR,Unheedful of the song that the landrail weaves along
1790,THAMAR,"Misty woodlands, or lightning that the pale sky laves"
1791,THAMAR,Like phosphorescent waves washing summer seas:
1792,THAMAR,"And, more beautiful than these, that sleep of dazèd wonder"
1793,THAMAR,When love has torn asunder the veils of the sky
1794,THAMAR,And raptured lovers lie faint in each other’s arms
1795,THAMAR,"Beneath a heaven strewn with myriad starry swarms,"
1796,THAMAR,Where planets float like lonely gold-flowered nenuphars
1797,THAMAR,"In pools of the sky; yet, when they wake, they turn"
1798,THAMAR,From those burning galaxies seeking heaven only
1799,THAMAR,"In each other’s eyes, and sigh, and sleep again;"
1800,THAMAR,"For while they sleep they seem to forget the world’s pain,"
1801,THAMAR,"And when they wake, they dream...."
1802,THAMAR,’But other sleep was mine
1803,THAMAR,"As I had drunk of wine with bitter hemlock steep’d,"
1804,THAMAR,Or sousèd with the heapèd milky poppyheads
1805,THAMAR,A drowsy Tartar treads where slow waters sweep
1806,THAMAR,"Over red river beds, and the air is heavy with sleep."
1807,THAMAR,"So, when I woke at last, the labouring earth had rolled"
1808,THAMAR,"Eastward under the vast dominion of night,"
1809,THAMAR,"Funereal, forlorn as that unlighted chamber"
1810,THAMAR,"Wherein she first was born, bereft of all starlight,"
1811,THAMAR,"Pale silver of the moon, or the low sun’s amber."
1812,THAMAR,"’Then to my queen I prayed, grave Ashtoreth, whose shade"
1813,THAMAR,"Hallows the dim abyss of Heliopolis,"
1814,THAMAR,"Where many an olive maid clashed kissing Syrian cymbals,"
1815,THAMAR,And silver-sounding timbrels shivered through the vale.
1816,THAMAR,"O lovely, and O white, under the holy night"
1817,THAMAR,"Is their gleaming wonder, and their brows are pale"
1818,THAMAR,"As the new risen moon, dancing till they swoon"
1819,THAMAR,"In far forests under desolate Lebanon,"
1820,THAMAR,While the flame of Moloch’s pyre reddens the sea-born cloud
1821,THAMAR,"That overshadows Tyre; so, when I cried aloud,"
1822,THAMAR,"Behold, a torch of fire leapt on the mountain-side!"
1823,THAMAR,"’O bright, O beautiful! for never kindlier light"
1824,THAMAR,Fell on the darkened sight of mortal eyes and dull
1825,THAMAR,"Since that devoted one, whom gloomy Caucasus"
1826,THAMAR,"In icy silence lonely bound to his cruel shoulders,"
1827,THAMAR,Brought to benighted men in a hollow fennel-stem
1828,THAMAR,Sparks of the torrid vapour that burned behind the bars
1829,THAMAR,"Of evening, broke dawn’s rose, or smouldered in the stars,"
1830,THAMAR,"Or lit the glowworm’s taper, or wavered over the fen,"
1831,THAMAR,"Or tipped the javelin of the far-ravening levin,"
1832,THAMAR,Lash of the Lord of Heaven and bitter scourge of sin.
1833,THAMAR,"O beautiful, O bright! my tired sinews strained"
1834,THAMAR,To this torch that flared and waned as a watery planet gloweth
1835,THAMAR,And waneth in the night when a calm sea floweth
1836,THAMAR,Under a misty sky spread with the tattered veils
1837,THAMAR,Of rapid cloud driven over the deeps of heaven
1838,THAMAR,By winds that range too high to sweep the languid sails.
1839,THAMAR,"On through the frozen night, like a blind moth flying"
1840,THAMAR,"With battered wing and bruisèd bloom into a light,"
1841,THAMAR,"I dragged my ragged limbs, cared not if I were dying,"
1842,THAMAR,"Knew not if I were dead, where cavernous crevasses,"
1843,THAMAR,"And stony desperate passes snared, waylaid my tread:"
1844,THAMAR,"In the roar of broken boulders split from rocky shoulders,"
1845,THAMAR,"In the thunder of snow sliding, or under the appalling"
1846,THAMAR,Rending of glacier ice or hoarse cataracts falling:
1847,THAMAR,And I knew not what could save me but the unholy guiding
1848,THAMAR,"That some demon gave me.  Thrice I fell, and thrice"
1849,THAMAR,In torrents of blue ice-water slipp’d and was toss’d
1850,THAMAR,"Like a dead leaf, or a ghost"
1851,THAMAR,Harried by thin bufferings of wind
1852,THAMAR,"Downward to Tartarus at daybreak,"
1853,THAMAR,Downward to the regions of the lost....
1854,THAMAR,"But the rushing waters ceased, and the bitter wind fell:"
1855,THAMAR,"How I cannot tell, unless that I had come"
1856,THAMAR,To the hollow heart of the storm where the wind is dumb;
1857,THAMAR,"And there my gelid blood thawed, glowed, and grew warm,"
1858,THAMAR,"While a black-hooded form caught at my arm, and stayed"
1859,THAMAR,"And held me as I swayed, until, at last, I saw"
1860,THAMAR,"In a strange unworldly awe, at the gate of light I stood:"
1861,THAMAR,"And I entered, alone...."
1862,THAMAR,"’Behold a cavern of stone carven, and in the midst"
1863,THAMAR,"A brazier that hissed with tongued flames, leaping"
1864,THAMAR,"Over whitened embers of gummy frankincense,"
1865,THAMAR,"Into a fume of dense and fragrant vapour, creeping"
1866,THAMAR,Over the roof to spread a milky coverlet
1867,THAMAR,Softer than the woof of webby spider’s net.
1868,THAMAR,But never spider yet spun a more delicate wonder
1869,THAMAR,"Than that which hung thereunder, drooping fold on fold,"
1870,THAMAR,"Silks that glowed with fire of tawny Oxus gold,"
1871,THAMAR,Richer than ever flowed from the eager fancy of man
1872,THAMAR,In his vain desire for beauty that endures:
1873,THAMAR,And on the floor were spread by many a heaped daiwan
1874,THAMAR,"Carpets of Kurdistan, cured skins, and water-ewers"
1875,THAMAR,Encrusted with such gems as emperors of Hind
1876,THAMAR,"(Swart conquerors, long dead) sought for their diadems."
1877,THAMAR,
1878,THAMAR,"No other light was there but one torch, flaring"
1879,THAMAR,"Against a square of sky possess’d by the wind,"
1880,THAMAR,And never another sound but the tongued flames creeping.
1881,THAMAR,"’At last, my eyes staring into the clouded gloom,"
1882,THAMAR,Saw that the caverned room with shadowy forms was strewn
1883,THAMAR,"In heavy sleep or swoon fallen, who did not move"
1884,THAMAR,But lay as mortals lie in the sweet release of love.
1885,THAMAR,"And stark between them stood huge eunuchs of ebony,"
1886,THAMAR,"Mute, motionless, as they had been carven of black wood."
1887,THAMAR,"But these I scarcely saw, for, through the flame was seen"
1888,THAMAR,"Another, a queen, with heavy closèd eyes"
1889,THAMAR,White against the skies of that empurpled night
1890,THAMAR,"In her loveliness she lay, and leaned upon her hand:"
1891,THAMAR,"And my blood leapt at the sight, so that I could not stand"
1892,THAMAR,"But fell upon my knees, pleading, and cried aloud"
1893,THAMAR,For her white loveliness as Ixion for his cloud:
1894,THAMAR,"And my cry the silence broke, and the sleepers awoke"
1895,THAMAR,"From their slumber, stirred, and rose every one,--save those"
1896,THAMAR,"Mute eunuchs of ebony, those frowning caryatides."
1897,THAMAR,"Slowly she looked at me, and when I cried again"
1898,THAMAR,"In yearning and in pain, she beckoned with her hand."
1899,THAMAR,"Then from my knees rose I, and greatly daring,"
1900,THAMAR,"Through the hazy air, past the brazier flaring"
1901,THAMAR,"And the hissing flame, crept, until I came"
1902,THAMAR,"Unto the carven seat, and kissed her white feet;"
1903,THAMAR,"And she smiled, but spake not."
1904,THAMAR,When she smiled the sleepers wavered as the grass
1905,THAMAR,Of a cornfield wavers when the ears are swept
1906,THAMAR,"By the breath of brown reapers singing as they pass,"
1907,THAMAR,Or grass of woody glades when a wind that has slept
1908,THAMAR,"Wakens, and invades their moonlit solitude,"
1909,THAMAR,When the hazels shiver and the birch is blown
1910,THAMAR,"To a billow of silver, but oaks in the wood"
1911,THAMAR,"Stand firm nor quiver, stand firm as stone:"
1912,THAMAR,"So, amid the sleepers, the black eunuchs stood."
1913,THAMAR,When the sleepers stirred faintly in the heat
1914,THAMAR,"Of that painted room a silken sound I heard,"
1915,THAMAR,"And a thin music, sweet as the brown nightingale"
1916,THAMAR,"Sings in the jealous shade of a lonely spinney,"
1917,THAMAR,Stranger far than any music mortal made
1918,THAMAR,Fell softer than the dew falleth when stars are pale.
1919,THAMAR,"Sweet it was, and clear as light, or as the tears"
1920,THAMAR,That sad Narcissus wears in the spring of the year
1921,THAMAR,On barren mountain ranges where rain falls cool
1922,THAMAR,And every lonely pool is sprayed with broken light:
1923,THAMAR,"So cool, so beautiful, and so divinely strange"
1924,THAMAR,I doubted if it came from any marshy reed
1925,THAMAR,"Or hollow fluting stem pluck’d by the hands of men,"
1926,THAMAR,Unless it were indeed that airy fugitive
1927,THAMAR,"Syrinx, who cried and ran before the laughing eyes"
1928,THAMAR,"Of goat-footed Pan, and must for ever live"
1929,THAMAR,A shadowy green reed by an Arcadian river--
1930,THAMAR,But never music made of Ladon’s reedy daughter
1931,THAMAR,"Or singing river-water more sweet than that which stole,"
1932,THAMAR,"Slow as amber honey wells from the honeycomb,"
1933,THAMAR,Into my weary soul with solace and strange peace.
1934,THAMAR,"So, trembling as I lay in a dream more desolate"
1935,THAMAR,"Than is the darkened day of the mid-winter north,"
1936,THAMAR,"I heard the voice of one who sang in a strange tongue,"
1937,THAMAR,"And I know not what he sang save that he sang of love,"
1938,THAMAR,"The while they led me forth unheeding, till we came"
1939,THAMAR,Unto a chamber lit with one slow-burning flame
1940,THAMAR,"That yellow horn bedims, and laid me down, and there"
1941,THAMAR,"They soothed my bruised limbs, and combed my tangled hair,"
1942,THAMAR,And salved my limbs with rarely-mingled unguents pressed
1943,THAMAR,By hands of holy ones who dream beneath the suns
1944,THAMAR,"Of Araby the Blest, and so, when they had bathed"
1945,THAMAR,My burning eyes with milk of dreamy anodyne
1946,THAMAR,"And cool’d my throat with wine,"
1947,THAMAR,"In robings of cool silk my broken body they swathed,"
1948,THAMAR,"Sandals of gold they placed upon my feet, and round"
1949,THAMAR,My sad sun-blistered brows a silver fillet bound--
1950,THAMAR,Decking me with the pride of a bridegroom that goes
1951,THAMAR,To the joy of his bride and is lovely in her eyes--
1952,THAMAR,"And led me to her side.  Then, as a conquering prince,"
1953,THAMAR,"I, who long since had been battered and tost"
1954,THAMAR,"Like a dead leaf or ghost buffeted by wild storms,"
1955,THAMAR,"Came to her white arms, conquering, and was lost,"
1956,THAMAR,Yet dared not gaze upon the beauty that I dreamed.
1957,THAMAR,"So, in my trance, it seemed that a shadowy soft dance"
1958,THAMAR,"Coiled slowly and unwound, swayed, beckoned, and recovered"
1959,THAMAR,As hooded cobra bound by hollow spells of sound
1960,THAMAR,Unto the piper sways; so silently they hovered
1961,THAMAR,"I only heard the beat of their naked feet,"
1962,THAMAR,"And then, another sound...."
1963,THAMAR,"A dull throb thrumming, a noise of faint drumming,"
1964,THAMAR,"Threatening, coming nearer, piercing deeper"
1965,THAMAR,Than a dream lost in the heart of a sleeper
1966,THAMAR,"Into those deeps where the dark fire gloweth,"
1967,THAMAR,"The secret flame that every man knoweth,"
1968,THAMAR,"Embers that smoulder, fires that none can fan,"
1969,THAMAR,"Terrible, older than the mind of man...."
1970,THAMAR,Before he crawled from his swamp and spurned
1971,THAMAR,The life of the beast that dark fire burned
1972,THAMAR,In the hidden deeps where no dream can come:
1973,THAMAR,Only the throbbing of a drum
1974,THAMAR,Can wake it from its smouldering--
1975,THAMAR,"Sightless, soundless, senseless, dumb--"
1976,THAMAR,Dumb as those blind seeds that lie
1977,THAMAR,"Drown’d in mud, and shuddering,"
1978,THAMAR,"I knew that I was man no more,"
1979,THAMAR,"But a throbbing core of flesh, that knew"
1980,THAMAR,"Nor beauty, nor truth, nor anything"
1981,THAMAR,But the black sky and the slimy earth:
1982,THAMAR,"Roots of trees, and fear, and pain,"
1983,THAMAR,"The blank of death, the pangs of birth,"
1984,THAMAR,An inhuman thing possess’d
1985,THAMAR,By the throbbing of a drum:
1986,THAMAR,"And my lips were strange and numb,"
1987,THAMAR,But they kissed her white breast....
1988,THAMAR,"Then, being drunk with pride and splendour of love, I cried:"
1989,THAMAR,"’""O spring of all delight, O moonèd mystery,"
1990,THAMAR,"O living marvel, white as the dead queen of night,"
1991,THAMAR,"O flower, and O flame ... tell me at least thy name"
1992,THAMAR,"That, from this desolate height, I may proclaim its wonder"
1993,THAMAR,To the lost lands hereunder before thy beauty dies
1994,THAMAR,"As fades the fire of dawn upon a peak of snow!""’"
1995,THAMAR,"Then: ""Look,"" she sighed, ""into my eyes, and thou shalt know."""
1996,THAMAR,"So, with her fingers frail, she pressed my brows, and so,"
1997,THAMAR,"Slowly, at last, she raised my drooping eyelids pale,"
1998,THAMAR,And in her eyes I gazed.
1999,THAMAR,"’Then fear, than love more blind,"
2000,THAMAR,Caught at my heart and fast in chains of horror bound--
2001,THAMAR,As one who in profound and midnight forest ways
2002,THAMAR,Sees in the dark the burning eyes of a tiger barred
2003,THAMAR,Or stealthy footed pard blaze in a solemn hate
2004,THAMAR,"And lust of human blood, yet cannot cry, nor turning"
2005,THAMAR,"Flee from the huddled wood, but stands and sees his fate,"
2006,THAMAR,"Or one who in a black night, groping for his track,"
2007,THAMAR,"Clings to the dizzy verge of a cragged precipice,"
2008,THAMAR,"Shrinks from the dim abyss, yet dare not venture back,"
2009,THAMAR,And no sound hears but the hiss of empty air
2010,THAMAR,"Swirling past his ears....  So, in a hideous"
2011,THAMAR,"Abandonment of hope, I waited for her kiss."
2012,THAMAR,Then the restless beat of the muttering drum
2013,THAMAR,Rose to a frenzied heat; the naked dancers leapt
2014,THAMAR,"Insolent through the flame, laughing as they came"
2015,THAMAR,"With parted lips; their cries deadened my ears, my eyes"
2016,THAMAR,"Throbbed with the pattering of their rapid feet,"
2017,THAMAR,And the whirling dust of their dancing swept
2018,THAMAR,"Into my throat unslaked, dry-parchèd with love’s drought,"
2019,THAMAR,Until my mouth was pressed upon her burning mouth
2020,THAMAR,"In a kiss most terrible....  Oh, was it pride, or shame"
2021,THAMAR,"Unending, without name, or ecstasy, or pain"
2022,THAMAR,"Or desperate desire?  Alas!  I cannot tell,"
2023,THAMAR,Save that it pierced my trembling soul and body with fire.
2024,THAMAR,"For, while her soft lips clove to mine in love, she drove"
2025,THAMAR,"A flaming blade of steel into my breast, and I,"
2026,THAMAR,"Rent with a bitter cry, slid from her side and fell"
2027,THAMAR,Clutching in dumb despair the dark unbraided hair
2028,THAMAR,"My passion had despoiled; while she, like serpent coiled,"
2029,THAMAR,"Poised for another stroke, terribly, slowly, smiled,"
2030,THAMAR,"Saying: ""O stranger, red, red are my lips, and sweet"
2031,THAMAR,Unto those lips so red are the kisses of the dead:
2032,THAMAR,"Far hast thou wandered, far, for the kisses of Thamar."""
2033,THAMAR,Then a deep silence fell on the frenzy and the laughter;
2034,THAMAR,"The leaping dancers crept to the shadows where they had slept,"
2035,THAMAR,"And the mute eunuchs stood forth, and hugely bent"
2036,THAMAR,"Above my body, spent in its pool of blood,"
2037,THAMAR,"And hove me with black arms, while the queen followed after"
2038,THAMAR,"With stealthy steps, and eyes that burned into the night"
2039,THAMAR,"Of my dying brain, till, with her hand, she bade"
2040,THAMAR,"Them falter, and they stayed, while, eagerly, she propped"
2041,THAMAR,"My listless head that dropped downward from my shoulders,"
2042,THAMAR,"And slowly raised it up, raised it like a cup"
2043,THAMAR,"Unto her lips again,"
2044,THAMAR,"Then shuddered, trembled, shrunk, as though her mouth had drunk"
2045,THAMAR,A potion where the fell fire of poison smoulders.
2046,THAMAR,"And a darkness came, and I could see no more,"
2047,THAMAR,But in my ears the roar of lonely torrents swelled
2048,THAMAR,"And stilled my breath for ever, as though a wave appalling"
2049,THAMAR,"Had broken in my brain, and deep to deep were calling:"
2050,THAMAR,And I felt my body falling down and down and down
2051,THAMAR,"Into a blank of death, where dumb waters roll"
2052,THAMAR,"Endlessly, only knowing, that her dagger had stabbed my breast,"
2053,THAMAR,But her kiss had killed my soul.
2054,THAMAR,And now I know no rest until again I stand
2055,THAMAR,"Where that lost city’s towers rise from the dreamy sand,"
2056,THAMAR,"Until I reach the gate where the lips of Asia wait,"
2057,THAMAR,"Till I cross the desert’s drought, and the rivers of the south,"
2058,THAMAR,And shiver through the night under those summits white
2059,THAMAR,That soar above Cathay; until I see the light
2060,THAMAR,"Flame from those tyrannous glooms where, like a tired star"
2061,THAMAR,"In stormy darkness, looms the castle of Thamar.’"
2062,THAMAR,
2063,THAMAR,
2064,THAMAR,
2065,THAMAR,
2066,ENVOI,ENVOI
2067,ENVOI,
2068,ENVOI,
2069,ENVOI,"Now that the hour has come, and under the lonely"
2070,ENVOI,"Darkness I stumble at the doors of death,"
2071,ENVOI,"It is not hope, nor faith"
2072,ENVOI,"That here my spirit sustaineth, but love only."
2073,ENVOI,
2074,ENVOI,"In visions, in love: only there have I clutched at divinity:"
2075,ENVOI,But the vision fadeth; yet love fades not: and for this
2076,ENVOI,I would have you know that your kiss
2077,ENVOI,Was more to me than all my hopes of infinity.
2078,ENVOI,
2079,ENVOI,"Therein you made me divine ... you, who were moon and sun for"
2080,ENVOI,"me,"
2081,ENVOI,"You, for whose beauty I would have forsaken the splendour of"
2082,ENVOI,the stars
2083,ENVOI,And my shadowy avatars
2084,ENVOI,Renounced: for there is nothing in the world you have not done
2085,ENVOI,for me.
2086,ENVOI,
2087,ENVOI,"So that when at length all sentient skill hath forsaken me,"
2088,ENVOI,"And the bright world beats vainly on my consciousness,"
2089,ENVOI,Your beauty shineth no less:
2090,ENVOI,And even if I were dead I think your shadow would awaken me.
2091,ENVOI,
