147,FOREWORD,FOREWORD
148,FOREWORD,
149,FOREWORD,
150,FOREWORD,My office on this occasion is one which I may well carry as lightly as
151,FOREWORD,"possible. In our society, I am told, one needs an introduction to a"
152,FOREWORD,beautiful woman; but I have never heard of men needing an introduction
153,FOREWORD,to a beautiful song. Prose before poetry is an unmeaning interruption;
154,FOREWORD,for poetry is perhaps the one thing in the world that explains itself.
155,FOREWORD,The only possible prelude for songs is silence; and I shall endeavour
156,FOREWORD,here to imitate the brevity of the silence as well as its stillness.
157,FOREWORD,
158,FOREWORD,This collection contains four new poems by one whom all serious critics
159,FOREWORD,now class with Shelley and Keats and those other great ones cut down
160,FOREWORD,"with their work unfinished. Yet I would not speak specially of him,"
161,FOREWORD,lest modern critics should run away with their mad notion of a one-man
162,FOREWORD,"influence; and call this a ""school"" of Francis Thompson. Francis"
163,FOREWORD,Thompson was not a schoolmaster. He would have said as freely as Whitman
164,FOREWORD,"(and with a far more consistent philosophy), ""I charge you to leave all"
165,FOREWORD,"free, as I have left all free."" The modern world has this mania about"
166,FOREWORD,plagiarism because the modern world cannot comprehend the idea of
167,FOREWORD,communion. It thinks that men must steal ideas; it does not understand
168,FOREWORD,that men may share them. The saints did not imitate each other; not
169,FOREWORD,always even study each other; they studied the Imitation of Christ.
170,FOREWORD,A real religion is that in which any two solitary people might suddenly
171,FOREWORD,say the same thing at any moment. It would therefore be most misleading
172,FOREWORD,to give to this collection an air of having been inspired by its most
173,FOREWORD,famous contributor. The little lyrics of this little book must surely
174,FOREWORD,"be counted individual, even by those who may count them mysterious."
175,FOREWORD,A variety verging on quaintness is the very note of the assembled bards.
176,FOREWORD,
177,FOREWORD,"Take, for example, Mr. Colum's stern and simple rendering of the bitter"
178,FOREWORD,old Irish verses:
179,FOREWORD,
180,FOREWORD,"""O woman, shapely as the swan,"
181,FOREWORD,"On your account I shall not die."""
182,FOREWORD,
183,FOREWORD,"Like Fitzgerald's Omar and all good translations, it leaves one"
184,FOREWORD,wondering whether the original was as good; but to an Englishman the
185,FOREWORD,"note is not only unique, but almost hostile. It is the hardness of the"
186,FOREWORD,real Irishman which has been so skilfully hidden under the softness of
187,FOREWORD,"the stage Irishman. The words are ages old, I believe; they come out of"
188,FOREWORD,the ancient Ireland of Cairns and fallen Kings: and yet the words might
189,FOREWORD,have been spoken by one of Bernard Shaw's modern heroes to one of his
190,FOREWORD,"modern heroines. The curt, bleak words, the haughty, heathen spirit are"
191,FOREWORD,certainly as remote as anything can be from the luxuriant humility of
192,FOREWORD,Francis Thompson.
193,FOREWORD,
194,FOREWORD,If the writers have a real point of union it is in a certain instinct
195,FOREWORD,for contrast between their shape and subject matter. All the poems are
196,FOREWORD,"brief in form, and at the same time big in topic. They remind us of the"
197,FOREWORD,"vivid illuminations of the virile thirteenth century, when artists"
198,FOREWORD,crowded cosmic catastrophes into the corner of an initial letter; where
199,FOREWORD,one may find a small picture of the Deluge or of the flaming Cities of
200,FOREWORD,the Plain. One of the specially short poems sees the universe overthrown
201,FOREWORD,and the good angels conquered. Another short poem sees the newsboys in
202,FOREWORD,"Fleet Street shouting the news of the end of the world, and the awful"
203,FOREWORD,return of God. The writers seem unconsciously to have sought to make a
204,FOREWORD,"poem as large as a revelation, while it was nearly as short as a riddle."
205,FOREWORD,And though Francis Thompson himself was rather in the Elizabethan
206,FOREWORD,"tradition of amplitude and ingenuity, he could write separate lines that"
207,FOREWORD,were separate poems in themselves:--
208,FOREWORD,
209,FOREWORD,"""And thou, what needest with thy tribe's black tents,"
210,FOREWORD,"Who hast the red pavilion of my heart?"""
211,FOREWORD,
212,FOREWORD,A mediaeval illuminator would have jumped out of his sandals in his
213,FOREWORD,eagerness to illustrate that.

284,_BUONA NOTTE_,My dream is not disquieted;
285,_BUONA NOTTE_,"Nay, deep I sleep upon the deep,"
286,_BUONA NOTTE_,"And my eyes are wet, but I do not weep;"
287,_BUONA NOTTE_,And I fell to sleep so suddenly
288,_BUONA NOTTE_,That my lips are moist yet--could'st thou see
289,_BUONA NOTTE_,With the good-night draught I have drunk to thee.
290,_BUONA NOTTE_,Thou can'st not wipe them; for it was Death
291,_BUONA NOTTE_,Damped my lips that has dried my breath.
