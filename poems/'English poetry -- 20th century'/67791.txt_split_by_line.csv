56,PREFACE,
57,PREFACE,What was said concerning the author in the preface to the first edition
58,PREFACE,may be repeated here. He was born at Old Aberdeen on 19 May 1895. From
59,PREFACE,1900 onwards his home was in Cambridge. He was at Marlborough College
60,PREFACE,"from September 1908 till December 1913, when he was elected to a"
61,PREFACE,"scholarship at University College, Oxford. After leaving school he spent"
62,PREFACE,"a little more than six months in Germany, returning home on the outbreak"
63,PREFACE,of war. He was gazetted Second Lieutenant in the Seventh (Service)
64,PREFACE,"Battalion of the Suffolk Regiment in August 1914, Lieutenant in"
65,PREFACE,"November, and Captain in the following August. His battalion was sent to"
66,PREFACE,France on 30 May. He was killed in action near Hulluch on 13 October
67,PREFACE,"1915. “Being made perfect in a little while, he fulfilled long years.”"
68,PREFACE,
69,PREFACE,Many readers have asked for further information about the author or
70,PREFACE,contributions from his pen. I am not able to give all that is asked for;
71,PREFACE,but in this edition I have done what I can to meet the wishes of my
72,PREFACE,correspondents by appending to the poems a certain number of
73,PREFACE,illustrations in prose. With the exception of a few sentences from an
74,PREFACE,"early essay, these prose passages are all taken from his letters to his"
75,PREFACE,family and friends. They have been selected as illustrating some idea or
76,PREFACE,subject mentioned in the poems and prominent in his own mind. But the
77,PREFACE,relevancy is not always very close; the moods of the moment are
78,PREFACE,sometimes expressed rather than matured judgments; and it has to be
79,PREFACE,remembered that what was written was not intended for other eyes than
80,PREFACE,those of the person to whom it was addressed.
81,PREFACE,
82,PREFACE,"With the poems it is different; and, had he lived, he would probably"
83,PREFACE,himself have published a selection of them with such revision as he
84,PREFACE,"deemed advisable. But when a suggestion about printing was made to him,"
85,PREFACE,"soon after he had entered upon his life in the trenches of Flanders, he"
86,PREFACE,"put the proposal aside as premature, adding “Besides, this is no time"
87,PREFACE,"for oliveyards and vineyards, more especially of the small-holdings"
88,PREFACE,"type. For three years or the duration of the war, let be.” His warfare"
89,PREFACE,"is now accomplished, and his relatives have felt themselves free to"
90,PREFACE,publish.
91,PREFACE,
92,PREFACE,The original order of the poems is retained in this edition. The first
93,PREFACE,place is assigned to the title-poem; some early poems are printed at the
94,PREFACE,"end; the other contents are arranged in the order of their composition,"
95,PREFACE,as nearly as that order could be ascertained. When the date given
96,PREFACE,"includes the day of the month, it has been taken from the author’s"
97,PREFACE,manuscript; some of the other dates are approximate. Of the undated
98,PREFACE,"poems, XIII to XVI were received from him in October 1914, XVII to XXIV"
99,PREFACE,"in April 1915, XXVII was found in his kit sent back from France, and"
100,PREFACE,XXVIII (which appeared for the first time in the second edition) was
101,PREFACE,sent to a friend towards the end of July 1915. A single piece of
102,PREFACE,imaginative prose has been included amongst the poems.
103,PREFACE,
104,PREFACE,Some further information regarding them has been obtained recently. XVI
105,PREFACE,was written when he was at the Officers’ Training Camp at Churn early in
106,PREFACE,"September 1914, and XVII a few days later, XV had its origin in his"
107,PREFACE,journey from Churn to join his regiment at Shorncliffe on 18 September.
108,PREFACE,The first draft of it was sent to a friend soon afterwards with the
109,PREFACE,words: “enclosed the poem which eventually came out of the first day of
110,PREFACE,term at Paddington. Not much trace of the origin left; but I think it
111,PREFACE,should get a prize for being the first poem written since August 4th
112,PREFACE,that isn’t patriotic.” This draft differs slightly from the final form
113,PREFACE,"of the poem, and instead of the present title (“Whom therefore we"
114,PREFACE,"ignorantly worship”), it is preceded by the verse “And these all, having"
115,PREFACE,"obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise.” The"
116,PREFACE,poem called “Lost” (XXIV) was sent to the same friend in December 1914.
117,PREFACE,"“I have tried for long,” he wrote, “to express in words the impression"
118,PREFACE,"that the land north of Marlborough must leave”; and he added,"
119,PREFACE,"“Simplicity, paucity of words, monotony almost, and mystery are"
120,PREFACE,"necessary. I think I have got it at last.” The signpost, which figures"
121,PREFACE,"here as well as elsewhere in the poems, stands at “the junction of the"
122,PREFACE,"grass tracks on the Aldbourne down--to Ogbourne, Marlborough,"
123,PREFACE,"Mildenhall, and Aldbourne. It stands up quite alone.”"
124,PREFACE,
125,PREFACE,"Three of the poems at least--II, VIII, and XII--were written entirely in"
126,PREFACE,"the open air. Concerning one of these he said, “‘Autumn Dawn’ has too"
127,PREFACE,"much copy from Meredith in it, but I value it as being (with ‘Return’) a"
128,PREFACE,memento of my walk to Marlborough last September [1913].” Sending his
129,PREFACE,"“occasional budget” in April 1915 he said, “You will notice that most of"
130,PREFACE,what I have written is as hurried and angular as the handwriting:
131,PREFACE,written out at different times and dirty with my pocket: but I have had
132,PREFACE,"no time for the final touch nor seem likely to have for some time, and"
133,PREFACE,so send them as they are. Nor have I had time to think out (as I usually
134,PREFACE,do) a rigorous selection as fit for other eyes. So these are my
135,PREFACE,"explanations of the fall in quality. I like ‘Le Revenant’ best, being"
136,PREFACE,very interested in the previous and future experience of the character
137,PREFACE,concerned: but it sadly needs the file.”
138,PREFACE,
139,PREFACE,"The letter in verse, fragments of which are given on pages 73-78, was"
140,PREFACE,sent anonymously to an older friend whose connexion with Marlborough is
141,PREFACE,commemorated in the poem entitled “J. B.” J. B. discovered the
142,PREFACE,authorship of the epistle by sending the envelope to a Marlborough
143,PREFACE,"master, and replied in the words which, by his permission, are printed"
144,PREFACE,on the opposite page.

364,BARBURY CAMP,"That lashed us into manhood with its thong,"

407,BARBURY CAMP,Wind that is we
408,BARBURY CAMP,"(We that were men)--make men in all this land,"
409,BARBURY CAMP,That so may live and wrestle and hate that when
410,BARBURY CAMP,"They fall at last exultant, as we fell,"
411,BARBURY CAMP,"And come to God, God may say, “Do you come then"
412,BARBURY CAMP,"Mildly enquiring, is it heaven or hell?"

605,EAST KENNET CHURCH AT EVENING,
606,EAST KENNET CHURCH AT EVENING,Crown-like it stood against the hills.
607,EAST KENNET CHURCH AT EVENING,Its form was passing fair.

610,EAST KENNET CHURCH AT EVENING,
611,EAST KENNET CHURCH AT EVENING,And far below the long vale stretched.
612,EAST KENNET CHURCH AT EVENING,As a sleeper she did seem

622,EAST KENNET CHURCH AT EVENING,She did not seem to rise.

625,EAST KENNET CHURCH AT EVENING,
626,EAST KENNET CHURCH AT EVENING,For now no church nor tree nor fold

655,AUTUMN DAWN,
656,AUTUMN DAWN,And this is morning. Would you think
657,AUTUMN DAWN,"That this was the morning, when the land"
658,AUTUMN DAWN,Is full of heavy eyes that blink
659,AUTUMN DAWN,"Half-opened, and the tall trees stand"
660,AUTUMN DAWN,Too tired to shake away the drops
661,AUTUMN DAWN,Of passing night that cling around
662,AUTUMN DAWN,Their branches and weigh down their tops:
663,AUTUMN DAWN,And the grey sky leans on the ground?
664,AUTUMN DAWN,"The thrush sings once or twice, but stops"
665,AUTUMN DAWN,Affrighted by the silent sound.
666,AUTUMN DAWN,"The sheep, scarce moving, munches, moans."
667,AUTUMN DAWN,"The slow herd mumbles, thick with phlegm."
668,AUTUMN DAWN,"The grey road-mender, hacking stones,"
669,AUTUMN DAWN,Is now become as one of them.
670,AUTUMN DAWN,Old mother Earth has rubbed her eyes
671,AUTUMN DAWN,"And stayed, so senseless, lying down."
672,AUTUMN DAWN,Old mother is too tired to rise
673,AUTUMN DAWN,"And lay aside her grey nightgown,"
674,AUTUMN DAWN,And come with singing and with strength
675,AUTUMN DAWN,"In loud exuberance of day,"
676,AUTUMN DAWN,"Swift-darting. She is tired at length,"
677,AUTUMN DAWN,"Done up, past bearing, you would say."
678,AUTUMN DAWN,"She’ll come no more in lust of strife,"
679,AUTUMN DAWN,"In hedges’ leap, and wild birds’ cries,"
680,AUTUMN DAWN,"In winds that cut you like a knife,"
681,AUTUMN DAWN,"In days of laughter and swift skies,"
682,AUTUMN DAWN,"That palpably pulsate with life,"
683,AUTUMN DAWN,"With life that kills, with life that dies."
684,AUTUMN DAWN,But in a morning such as this
685,AUTUMN DAWN,"Is neither life nor death to see,"
686,AUTUMN DAWN,"Only that state which some call bliss,"
687,AUTUMN DAWN,Grey hopeless immortality.
688,AUTUMN DAWN,Earth is at length bedrid. She is
689,AUTUMN DAWN,Supinest of the things that be:
690,AUTUMN DAWN,"And stilly, heavy with long years,"
691,AUTUMN DAWN,"Brings forth such days in dumb regret,"
692,AUTUMN DAWN,"Immortal days, that rise in tears,"
693,AUTUMN DAWN,"And cannot, though they strive to, set."

698,AUTUMN DAWN,"The sun appeareth over there,"
699,AUTUMN DAWN,And with red fingers hasteneth
700,AUTUMN DAWN,"From Earth’s grey bed the clothes to tear,"
701,AUTUMN DAWN,And strike the heavy mist’s dank tent.
702,AUTUMN DAWN,And Earth uprises with a sigh.
703,AUTUMN DAWN,She is astir. She is not spent.
704,AUTUMN DAWN,And yet she lives and yet can die.
705,AUTUMN DAWN,The grey road-mender from the ditch
706,AUTUMN DAWN,Looks up. He has not looked before.
707,AUTUMN DAWN,The stunted tree sways like the witch
708,AUTUMN DAWN,It was: ’tis living witch once more.
709,AUTUMN DAWN,The winds are washen. In the deep
710,AUTUMN DAWN,Dew of the morn they’ve washed. The skies
711,AUTUMN DAWN,Are changing dress. The clumsy sheep
712,AUTUMN DAWN,"Bound, and earth’s many bosoms rise,"
713,AUTUMN DAWN,And earth’s green tresses spring and leap
714,AUTUMN DAWN,"About her brow. The earth has eyes,"
715,AUTUMN DAWN,"The earth has voice, the earth has breath,"
716,AUTUMN DAWN,"As o’er the land and through the air,"
717,AUTUMN DAWN,"With wingéd sandals, Life and Death"
718,AUTUMN DAWN,Speed hand in hand--that winsome pair!

1198,I BRAND,"I too have trodden it those prints a-near,"
1199,I BRAND,But the sea washes out my tired foot-traces.
1200,I BRAND,And all that thou hast healed and holpen here
1201,I BRAND,I yearned to heal and help and wipe the tear
1202,I BRAND,Away. But still I trod unpeopled spaces.
1203,I BRAND,I had no twelve to follow my pure paces.
1204,I BRAND,"For I had thy misgivings and thy fear,"
1205,I BRAND,"Thy crown of scorn, thy suffering’s sharp spear,"
1206,I BRAND,"Thy hopes, thy longings--only not thy dear"

1221,II PEER GYNT,"And wounded too, we could not hate him long."
1222,II PEER GYNT,
1223,II PEER GYNT,For kingliness and conquest pranced he forth
1224,II PEER GYNT,Like some high-stepping charger bright with foam.

1226,II PEER GYNT,With need of crowns and never need of home.
1227,II PEER GYNT,
1228,II PEER GYNT,Enraged we heard high tidings of his strength
1229,II PEER GYNT,And cursed his long forgetfulness. We swore
1230,II PEER GYNT,That should he come back home some eve at length.
1231,II PEER GYNT,"We would deny him, we would bar the door!"
1232,II PEER GYNT,
1233,II PEER GYNT,And then he came. The sound of those tired feet!
1234,II PEER GYNT,"And all our home and all our hearts are his,"
1235,II PEER GYNT,"Where bitterness, grown weary, turns to sweet,"
1236,II PEER GYNT,"And envy, purged by longing, pity is."
1237,II PEER GYNT,
1238,II PEER GYNT,"And pillows rest beneath the withering cheek,"

1406,LE REVENANT,Its chimneys still stand black and bare--
1407,LE REVENANT,
1408,LE REVENANT,He noticed that the trees were not
1409,LE REVENANT,So big as when he journeyed last

1411,LE REVENANT,"Striding above the hedges, hot"
1412,LE REVENANT,
1413,LE REVENANT,"With hopings, as he passed by where"
1414,LE REVENANT,A lamp before him glanced and stayed

1422,LE REVENANT,
1423,LE REVENANT,"He topped the crest and crossed the fence,"
1424,LE REVENANT,Noticed the garden that it grew
1425,LE REVENANT,"As erst, noticed the hen-house too"
1426,LE REVENANT,(The kennel had been altered since).
1427,LE REVENANT,
1428,LE REVENANT,It seemed so unchanged and so still.
1429,LE REVENANT,(Could it but be the past arisen
1430,LE REVENANT,For one short night from out of prison?)

1433,LE REVENANT,"Lifted the window sash with care,"
1434,LE REVENANT,"Then, gaily throwing aside the blind,"

1436,LE REVENANT,That he was not remembered there.
1437,LE REVENANT,
1438,LE REVENANT,"At once he felt not all his pain,"
1439,LE REVENANT,"But murmuringly apologised,"

1518,I,Do hourly wait to pass your pathway down.
1519,I,"You, so familiar, once were strange: we tried"
1520,I,To live as of your presence unaware.
1521,I,But now in every road on every side
1522,I,We see your straight and steadfast signpost there.
1523,I,
1524,I,I think it like that signpost in my land
1525,I,"Hoary and tall, which pointed me to go"
1526,I,"Upward, into the hills, on the right hand,"
1527,I,"Where the mists swim and the winds shriek and blow,"

1545,II,But a big blot has hid each yesterday

1563,XXVII,"Give them not praise. For, deaf, how should they know"
1564,XXVII,It is not curses heaped on each gashed head?
1565,XXVII,Nor tears. Their blind eyes see not your tears flow.
1566,XXVII,Nor honour. It is easy to be dead.
1567,XXVII,"Say only this, “They are dead.” Then add thereto,"
1568,XXVII,“Yet many a better one has died before.”
1569,XXVII,"Then, scanning all the o’ercrowded mass, should you"

1583,XXVIII,"Birth, fragrance, sunlight, immanency,"
1584,XXVIII,To make us view our rights of birth.

1586,XXVIII,"We, captives of a roaming earth,"

1589,XXVIII,Dumb earth basks dewy-washed; while still

1618,XXVIII,"Make Beauty and make Rest give place,"
1619,XXVIII,"Mock Prudence loud--and she is gone,"
1620,XXVIII,Smite Satisfaction on the face
1621,XXVIII,And tread the ghost of Ease upon.
1622,XXVIII,Light-lipped and singing press we hard
1623,XXVIII,"Over old earth which now is worn,"
1624,XXVIII,"Triumphant, buffetted and scarred,"
1625,XXVIII,"By billows howled at, tempest-torn,"

1644,XXIX,"How, when they went down Sparta way,"
1645,XXIX,"To sandy Sparta, long ere dawn"
1646,XXIX,"Horses were harnessed, rations drawn,"
1647,XXIX,"Equipment polished sparkling bright,"
1648,XXIX,And breakfasts swallowed (as the white
1649,XXIX,Of Eastern heavens turned to gold)--
1650,XXIX,"The dogs barked, swift farewells were told."
1651,XXIX,"The sun springs up, the horses neigh,"
1652,XXIX,Crackles the whip thrice--then away!
1653,XXIX,From sun-go-up to sun-go-down
1654,XXIX,All day across the sandy down
1655,XXIX,"The gallant horses galloped, till"
1656,XXIX,The wind across the downs more chill
1657,XXIX,"Blew, the sun sank and all the road"
1658,XXIX,"Was darkened, that it only showed"
1659,XXIX,Right at the end the town’s red light
1660,XXIX,And twilight glimmering into night.
1661,XXIX,
1662,XXIX,The horses never slackened till
1663,XXIX,They reached the doorway and stood still.
1664,XXIX,"Then came the knock, the unlading; then"
1665,XXIX,"The honey-sweet converse of men,"
1666,XXIX,"The splendid bath, the change of dress,"
1667,XXIX,"Then--O the grandeur of their Mess,"
1668,XXIX,"The henchmen, the prim stewardess!"
1669,XXIX,"And O the breaking of old ground,"
1670,XXIX,"The tales, after the port went round!"
1671,XXIX,"(The wondrous wiles of old Odysseus,"
1672,XXIX,Old Agamemnon and his misuse
1673,XXIX,"Of his command, and that young chit"
1674,XXIX,Paris--who didn’t care a bit
1675,XXIX,For Helen--only to annoy her
1676,XXIX,"He did it really, κ.τ.λ.)"
1677,XXIX,But soon they led amidst the din
1678,XXIX,"The honey-sweet ἀοιδὸς in,"
1679,XXIX,"Whose eyes were blind, whose soul had sight,"
1680,XXIX,Who knew the fame of men in fight--
1681,XXIX,"Bard of white hair and trembling foot,"
1682,XXIX,Who sang whatever God might put
1683,XXIX,Into his heart.
1684,XXIX,"And there he sung,"
1685,XXIX,"Those war-worn veterans among,"
1686,XXIX,"Tales of great war and strong hearts wrung,"
1687,XXIX,"Of clash of arms, of council’s brawl,"
1688,XXIX,"Of beauty that must early fall,"
1689,XXIX,Of battle hate and battle joy
1690,XXIX,By the old windy walls of Troy.
1691,XXIX,"They felt that they were unreal then,"
1692,XXIX,"Visions and shadow-forms, not men."
1693,XXIX,But those the Bard did sing and say
1694,XXIX,"(Some were their comrades, some were they)"
1695,XXIX,Took shape and loomed and strengthened more
1696,XXIX,Greatly than they had guessed of yore.
1697,XXIX,"And now the fight begins again,"
1698,XXIX,"The old war-joy, the old war-pain."
1699,XXIX,Sons of one school across the sea
1700,XXIX,We have no fear to fight--

1705,XXIX,"With the body or without it,"
1706,XXIX,We shall all come tumbling down
1707,XXIX,To our old wrinkled red-capped town.
1708,XXIX,"Perhaps the road up Ilsley way,"
1709,XXIX,"The old ridge-track, will be my way."
1710,XXIX,"High up among the sheep and sky,"
1711,XXIX,"Look down on Wantage, passing by,"
1712,XXIX,And see the smoke from Swindon town;
1713,XXIX,"And then full left at Liddington,"
1714,XXIX,Where the four winds of heaven meet
1715,XXIX,The earth-blest traveller to greet.
1716,XXIX,"And then my face is toward the south,"
1717,XXIX,There is a singing on my mouth:
1718,XXIX,Away to rightward I descry
1719,XXIX,"My Barbury ensconced in sky,"
1720,XXIX,"Far underneath the Ogbourne twins,"
1721,XXIX,"And at my feet the thyme and whins,"
1722,XXIX,The grasses with their little crowns
1723,XXIX,"Of gold, the lovely Aldbourne downs,"
1724,XXIX,And that old signpost (well I knew
1725,XXIX,"That crazy signpost, arms askew,"
1726,XXIX,Old mother of the four grass ways).
1727,XXIX,"And then my mouth is dumb with praise,"
1728,XXIX,"For, past the wood and chalkpit tiny,"
1729,XXIX,A glimpse of Marlborough ἐρατεινή!
1730,XXIX,So I descend beneath the rail
1731,XXIX,To warmth and welcome and wassail.

1734,XXIX,
1735,XXIX,"This from the battered trenches--rough,"
1736,XXIX,Jingling and tedious enough.
1737,XXIX,And so I sign myself to you:
1738,XXIX,"One, who some crooked pathways knew"
1739,XXIX,Round Bedwyn: who could scarcely leave
1740,XXIX,The Downs on a December eve:
1741,XXIX,"Was at his happiest in shorts,"
1742,XXIX,And got--not many good reports!
1743,XXIX,Small skill of rhyming in his hand--
1744,XXIX,But you’ll forgive--you’ll understand.

1778,BEHIND THE LINES,"We are now at the end of a few days’ rest, a kilometre behind the lines."
1779,BEHIND THE LINES,Except for the farmyard noises (new style) it might almost be the little
1780,BEHIND THE LINES,village that first took us to its arms six weeks ago. It has been a fine
1781,BEHIND THE LINES,"day, following on a day’s rain, so that the earth smells like spring. I"
1782,BEHIND THE LINES,have just managed to break off a long conversation with the farmer in
1783,BEHIND THE LINES,"charge, a tall thin stooping man with sad eyes, in trouble about his"
1784,BEHIND THE LINES,"land: les Anglais stole his peas, trod down his corn and robbed his"
1785,BEHIND THE LINES,young potatoes: he told it as a father telling of infanticide. There may
1786,BEHIND THE LINES,have been fifteen francs’ worth of damage done; he will never get
1787,BEHIND THE LINES,compensation out of those shifty Belgian burgomasters; but it was not
1788,BEHIND THE LINES,exactly the fifteen francs but the invasion of the soil that had been
1789,BEHIND THE LINES,"his for forty years, in which the weather was his only enemy, that gave"
1790,BEHIND THE LINES,him a kind of Niobe’s dignity to his complaint.
1791,BEHIND THE LINES,
1792,BEHIND THE LINES,"Meanwhile there is the usual evening sluggishness. Close by, a"
1793,BEHIND THE LINES,quickfirer is pounding away its allowance of a dozen shells a day. It is
1794,BEHIND THE LINES,like a cow coughing. Eastward there begins a sound (all sounds begin at
1795,BEHIND THE LINES,"sundown and continue intermittently till midnight, reaching their zenith"
1796,BEHIND THE LINES,at about 9 p.m. and then dying away as sleepiness claims their
1797,BEHIND THE LINES,masters)--a sound like a motor-cycle race--thousands of motor-cycles
1798,BEHIND THE LINES,"tearing round and round a track, with cut-outs out: it is really a pair"
1799,BEHIND THE LINES,of machine guns firing. And now one sound awakens another. The old cow
1800,BEHIND THE LINES,coughing has started the motor-bykes: and now at intervals of a few
1801,BEHIND THE LINES,minutes come express trains in our direction: you can hear them rushing
1802,BEHIND THE LINES,toward us; they pass going straight for the town behind us: and you hear
1803,BEHIND THE LINES,them begin to slow down as they reach the town: they will soon stop: but
1804,BEHIND THE LINES,"no, every time, just before they reach it, is a tremendous railway"
1805,BEHIND THE LINES,"accident. At least, it must be a railway accident, there is so much"
1806,BEHIND THE LINES,"noise, and you can see the dust that the wreckage scatters. Sometimes"
1807,BEHIND THE LINES,"the train behind comes very close, but it too smashes on the wreckage"
1808,BEHIND THE LINES,"of its forerunners. A tremendous cloud of dust, and then the groans. So"
1809,BEHIND THE LINES,many trains and accidents start the cow coughing again: only another cow
1810,BEHIND THE LINES,"this time, somewhere behind us, a tremendous-sized cow, θαυμἀσιον ὄσιον,"
1811,BEHIND THE LINES,with awful whooping-cough. It must be a buffalo: this cough must burst
1812,BEHIND THE LINES,"its sides. And now someone starts sliding down the stairs on a tin tray,"
1813,BEHIND THE LINES,"to soften the heart of the cow, make it laugh and cure its cough. The"
1814,BEHIND THE LINES,"din he makes is appalling. He is beating the tray with a broom now,"
1815,BEHIND THE LINES,every two minutes a stroke: he has certainly stopped the cow by this
1816,BEHIND THE LINES,"time, probably killed it. He will leave off soon (thanks to the “shell"
1817,BEHIND THE LINES,tragedy”): we know he can’t last.
1818,BEHIND THE LINES,
1819,BEHIND THE LINES,It is now almost dark: come out and see the fireworks. While waiting for
1820,BEHIND THE LINES,them to begin you can notice how pale and white the corn is in the
1821,BEHIND THE LINES,summer twilight: no wonder with all this whooping-cough about. And the
1822,BEHIND THE LINES,motor-cycles: notice how all these races have at least a hundred
1823,BEHIND THE LINES,entries: there is never a single cycle going. And why are there no birds
1824,BEHIND THE LINES,coming back to roost? Where is the lark? I haven’t heard him all to-day.
1825,BEHIND THE LINES,"He must have got whooping-cough as well, or be staying at home through"
1826,BEHIND THE LINES,"fear of the cow. I think it will rain to-morrow, but there have been no"
1827,BEHIND THE LINES,"swallows circling low, stroking their breasts on the full ears of corn."
1828,BEHIND THE LINES,"Anyhow, it is night now, but the circus does not close till twelve."
1829,BEHIND THE LINES,Look! there is the first of them! The fireworks are beginning. Red
1830,BEHIND THE LINES,"flares shooting up high into the night, or skimming low over the ground,"
1831,BEHIND THE LINES,like the swallows that are not: and rockets bursting into stars. See how
1832,BEHIND THE LINES,"they illumine that patch of ground a mile in front. See it, it is deadly"
1833,BEHIND THE LINES,"pale in their searching light: ghastly, I think, and featureless except"
1834,BEHIND THE LINES,"for two big lines of eyebrows ashy white, parallel along it, raised a"
1835,BEHIND THE LINES,"little from its surface. Eyebrows. Where are the eyes? Hush, there are"
1836,BEHIND THE LINES,no eyes. What those shooting flares illumine is a mole. A long thin
1837,BEHIND THE LINES,"mole. Burrowing by day, and shoving a timorous enquiring snout above the"
1838,BEHIND THE LINES,"ground by night. Look, did you see it? No, you cannot see it from here."
1839,BEHIND THE LINES,"But were you a good deal nearer, you would see behind that snout a long"
1840,BEHIND THE LINES,and endless row of sharp shining teeth. The rockets catch the light from
1841,BEHIND THE LINES,these teeth and the teeth glitter: they are silently removed from the
1842,BEHIND THE LINES,"poison-spitting gums of the mole. For the mole’s gums spit fire and,"
1843,BEHIND THE LINES,"they say, send something more concrete than fire darting into the"
1844,BEHIND THE LINES,night. Even when its teeth are off. But you cannot see all this from
1845,BEHIND THE LINES,here: you can only see the rockets and then for a moment the pale ground
1846,BEHIND THE LINES,beneath. But it is quite dark now.
1847,BEHIND THE LINES,
1848,BEHIND THE LINES,And now for the fun of the fair! You will hear soon the riding-master
1849,BEHIND THE LINES,"crack his whip--why, there it is. Listen, a thousand whips are cracking,"
1850,BEHIND THE LINES,whipping the horses round the ring. At last! The fun of the circus is
1851,BEHIND THE LINES,begun. For the motor-cycle team race has started off again: and the
1852,BEHIND THE LINES,"whips are cracking all: and the waresman starts again, beating his loud"
1853,BEHIND THE LINES,tin tray to attract the customers: and the cows in the cattle-show start
1854,BEHIND THE LINES,"coughing, coughing: and the firework display is at its best: and the"
1855,BEHIND THE LINES,circus specials come one after another bearing the merry makers back to
1856,BEHIND THE LINES,"town, all to the inevitable crash, the inevitable accident. It can’t"
1857,BEHIND THE LINES,"last long: these accidents are so frequent, they’ll all get soon killed"
1858,BEHIND THE LINES,"off, I hope. Yes, it is diminishing. The train service is cancelled (and"
1859,BEHIND THE LINES,time too): the cows have stopped coughing: and the cycle race is done.
1860,BEHIND THE LINES,Only the kids who have bought new whips at the fair continue to crack
1861,BEHIND THE LINES,them: and unused rockets that lie about the ground are still sent up
1862,BEHIND THE LINES,occasionally. But now the children are being driven off to bed: only an
1863,BEHIND THE LINES,occasional whip-crack now (perhaps the child is now the sufferer): and
1864,BEHIND THE LINES,the tired showmen going over the ground pick up the rocket-sticks and
1865,BEHIND THE LINES,dead flares. At least I suppose this is what must be happening: for
1866,BEHIND THE LINES,occasionally they still find one that has not gone off and send it up
1867,BEHIND THE LINES,out of mere perversity. Else what silence!
1868,BEHIND THE LINES,
1869,BEHIND THE LINES,"It must be midnight now. Yes, it is midnight. But before you go to bed,"

2215,THE RIVER,"It did not hasten, nor was slack,"

2267,THE RIVER,That still went gliding by
2268,THE RIVER,The thing that never travels back
2269,THE RIVER,Received him silently.
2270,THE RIVER,"And there was left no shred, no wrack"

2332,I,showing off his knowledge. I am also reading a very interesting book on
2333,I,"Goethe and Schiller; very adoring it is, but it lets out quite"
2334,I,unconsciously the terrible dryness of their entirely intellectual
2335,I,friendship and (Goethe’s at least) entirely intellectual life. If Goethe
2336,I,"really died saying “more light,” it was very silly of him: what _he_"
2337,I,"wanted was more warmth. G. and S. apparently made friends, on their own"
2338,I,"confession, merely because their ideas and artistic ideals were the"
2339,I,"same, which fact ought to be the very first to make them bore one"
2340,I,another.
2341,I,
2342,I,All this is leading to the following conclusion. The Germans can act
2343,I,"Shakespeare, have good beer and poetry, but their prose is cobwebby"
2344,I,stuff. Hence I want to read some good prose again. Also it is summer.
2345,I,And for a year or two I had always laid up “The Pageant of Summer” as a
2346,I,treat for a hot July. In spite of all former vows of celibacy in the
2347,I,"way of English, now’s the time. So, unless the cost of book-postage here"

2361,I,I’ve given up German prose altogether. It’s like a stale cake compounded
2362,I,of foreign elements. So I have laid in a huge store of Richard Jefferies
2363,I,"for the rest of July, and read him none the less voraciously because we"
2364,I,"are countrymen. (I know it’s wrong of me, but I count myself as"
2365,I,Wiltshire....) When I die (in sixty years) I am going to leave all my
2366,I,presumably enormous fortune to Marlborough on condition that a thorough
2367,I,knowledge of Richard Jefferies is ensured by the teaching there. I think
2368,I,it is only right considering we are bred upon the self-same hill. It
2369,I,would also encourage Naturalists and discourage cricketers....
2370,I,
2371,I,"But, in any case. I’m not reading so much German as I did ought to. I"
2372,I,"dabble in their modern poetry, which is mostly of the morbidly religious"
2373,I,"kind. The language is massively beautiful, the thought is rich and"
2374,I,"sleek, the air that of the inside of a church. Magnificent artists they"
2375,I,"are, with no inspiration, who take religion up as a very responsive"
2376,I,"subject for art, and mould it in their hands like sticky putty. There"
2377,I,"are magnificent parts in it, but you can imagine what a relief it was to"
2378,I,get back to Jefferies and Liddington Castle. (_July 1914._)

2384,II,
2385,II,"Ibsen’s last, _John Gabriel Borkman_, is a wonderfully fine play, far"
2386,II,"better than any others by Ibsen that I have read or seen, but I can"
2387,II,imagine it would lose a good deal in an English translation. The acting
2388,II,of the two middle-aged sisters who are the protagonists was marvellous.
2389,II,"The men were a good deal more difficult to hear, but also very striking."
2390,II,Next to the fineness of the play (which has far more poetry in it than
2391,II,"any others of his I’ve read, though of course there’s a bank in the"
2392,II,"background, as there always seems to be in Ibsen)--the apathy of the"
2393,II,very crowded house struck me most. There was very little clapping at the
2394,II,"end at the acts: at the end of the play none, which was just as well"
2395,II,because one of them was dead and would have had to jump up again. So
2396,II,"altogether I am very much struck by my first German theatre, though the"
2397,II,fineness of the play may have much to do with it. It was just a little
2398,II,spoilt by the last Act being in a pine forest on a hill with sugar that
2399,II,was meant to look like snow. This rather took away from the effect of
2400,II,"the scene, which in the German is one of the finest things I have ever"
2401,II,"heard, possessing throughout a wonderful rhythm which may or may not"
2402,II,exist in the original. What a beautiful language it can be! (_13

2407,II,"I have been reading many criticisms of _John Gabriel Borkman_, and it"
2408,II,strikes me more and more that it is the most remarkable play I have ever
2409,II,read. It is head and shoulders above the others of Ibsen’s I know: a
2410,II,much broader affair. John Gabriel Borkman is a tremendous character. His
2411,II,"great desire, which led him to overstep the law for one moment, and of"
2412,II,"course he was caught and got eight years, was “Menschenglück zu"
2413,II,schaffen.” One moment Ibsen lets you see one side of his character (the
2414,II,side he himself saw) and you see the Perfect Altruist: the next moment
2415,II,"the other side is turned, and you see the Complete Egoist. The play all"
2416,II,"takes place in the last three hours of J. G. B.’s life, and in these"
2417,II,"three hours his real love, whom he had rejected for business reasons"
2418,II,"and married her twin-sister, shows him for the first time the Egoist"
2419,II,that masqueraded all its life as Altruist. The technique is perfect and
2420,II,"it bristles with minor problems. It is absolutely fair, for if J. G. B."
2421,II,"had sacrificed his ideals and married the right twin, he would not have"
2422,II,been deserted after his disgrace. And the way that during the three
2423,II,hours the whole past history of the man comes out is marvellous. The
2424,II,"brief dialogue between the sisters which closes the piece is fine, and"
2425,II,suddenly throws a new light on the problem of how the tragedy could have
2426,II,"been evaded, when you thought all that could be said had been said. (_20"

2444,II,[The play] at the Königliches Schauspielhaus [Berlin] was Ibsen’s _Peer
2445,II,"Gynt_ with Grieg’s incidental music--the Northern Faust, as it is"
2446,II,called: though the mixture of allegory and reality is not carried off so
2447,II,successfully as in the Southern Faust. Peer Gynt has the advantage of
2448,II,"being a far more human and amiable creature, and not a cold fish like"
2449,II,Faust. I suppose that difference is also to be found in the characters
2450,II,of the respective authors. I always wanted to know why Faust had no
2451,II,"relations to make demands on him. Peer Gynt is a charmingly light piece,"
2452,II,with an irresistible mixture of fantastical poetry and a very racy
2453,II,"humour. The scene where Peer returns to his blind and dying mother and,"
2454,II,"like a practical fellow, instead of sentimentalizing, sits himself on"
2455,II,"the end of her bed, persuades her it is a chariot and rides her up to"
2456,II,"heaven, describing the scenes on the way, the surliness of St Peter at"
2457,II,"the gate, the appearance of God the Father, who “put Peter quite in the"

2465,III,
2466,III,The _Odyssey_ is a great joy when once you can read it in big chunks and
2467,III,"not a hundred lines at a time, being [forced] to note all the silly"
2468,III,grammatical strangenesses. I could not read it in better surroundings
2469,III,for the whole tone of the book is so thoroughly German and domestic. A
2470,III,friend of sorts of the ----s died lately; and when the Frau attempted
2471,III,"to break the news to Karl at table, he immediately said “Don’t tell me"
2472,III,anything sad while I’m eating.” That very afternoon I came across
2473,III,"someone in the _Odyssey_ who made, under the same circumstances,"
2474,III,precisely the same remark[1]. In the _Odyssey_ and in Schwerin alike
2475,III,they are perfectly unaffected about their devotion to good food. In both
2476,III,too I find the double patriotism which suffers not a bit from its
2477,III,duplicity--in the _Odyssey_ to their little Ithaca as well as to Achaea
2478,III,as a whole; here equally to the Kaiser and the pug-nosed Grand Duke. In
2479,III,both is the habit of longwinded anecdotage in the same rambling
2480,III,"irrelevant way, and the quite unquenchable hospitality. And the Helen of"
2481,III,the _Odyssey_ bustling about a footstool for Telemachus or showing off
2482,III,her new presents (she had just returned from a jaunt to Egypt)--a
2483,III,"washing-tub, and a work-basket that ran on wheels (think!)--is the"
2484,III,perfect German Hausfrau. (_27 March 1914._)

2490,III,and holy Pylos in the time of Odysseus with life in
2491,III,Mecklenburg-Schwerin in the time of Herr Dr ----. In both you get the
2492,III,same unquenchable hospitality and perfectly unquenchable anecdotage
2493,III,"faculty. In both whenever you make a visit or go into a house, they are"
2494,III,“busying themselves with a meal.” Du lieber Karl (I mean Herr Dr ----)
2495,III,"has three times, when his wife has tried to talk of death, disease or"

2497,III,Peisistratus’s sound remark οὐ γὰρ ἐγώ γε τέρπουʹ ὀδυρόμενος
2498,III,μεταδόρπιοσ[2]--and that is their attitude to meals throughout. Need I
2499,III,"add the ἀγλαὰ δῶρα they insist on giving their guests, with the opinion"
2500,III,that it is the host that is the indebted party and the possession of a
2501,III,"guest confers honour and responsibility: and their innate patriotism,"
2502,III,the οὔ τοι ἐγώ γε ἦς γαίης δύναμαι γλυκερώτερον ἄλλο ἰδέσθαι[3] spirit
2503,III,(however dull it is)--to complete the parallel? So I am really reading
2504,III,"it in sympathetic surroundings, and when I have just got past the part"
2505,III,where Helen shows off to Menelaus her new work-basket that runs on
2506,III,"wheels, and the Frau rushes in to show me her new water-can with a spout"
2507,III,designed to resemble a pig--I see the two are made from the same stuff
2508,III,"(I mean, of course, Helen and Frau ----, not Frau ---- and the pig). Also,"

2515,III,"Good luck to Helen of Troy. As you say, she loved her own sex as well."
2516,III,Her last appearance in Homer is when Telemachus was just leaving her and
2517,III,"Menelaus after paying them a visit in Sparta, and she stood on the"
2518,III,doorstep with a robe in her hand and spoke a word and called him ‘I also
2519,III,"am giving thee a gift, dear child,--this, a memorial of Helen’s"
2520,III,"handiwork, against the day of thy marriage to which we all look forward,"
2521,III,"that thou mayest give it to thy wife: till then, let it be stored in thy"
2522,III,palace under thy mother’s care.’” But she never gives to me the
2523,III,impression in Homer of being quite happy. I’m sure she was always dull
2524,III,down in Sparta with fatherly old Menelaus--though she never showed it of
2525,III,course. But there is always something a little wistful in her way of
2526,III,speaking. She only made other people happy and consequently another set
2527,III,of other people miserable. One of the best things in the _Iliad_ is the
2528,III,way you are made to feel (without any statement) that Helen fell really
2529,III,"in love with Hector--and this shows her good taste, for of all the"
2530,III,Homeric heroes Hector is the only unselfish man. She seems to me only to
2531,III,have loved to please Menelaus and Paris but to have really loved
2532,III,"Hector--and naturally for Hector and Achilles, the altruist and the"
2533,III,"egoist, were miles nobler than any one else on either side--but Hector"
2534,III,never gave any sign that he regarded her as anything more than his
2535,III,distressed sister-in-law. But after Hector’s death she must have left
2536,III,"part of her behind her, and made a real nice wife to poor pompous"
2537,III,Menelaus in his old age. She seems to have had a marvellous power of
2538,III,adaptability. (_April 1914._)

2546,III,wall-paintings of the _Odyssey_. They are the best criticism of the book
2547,III,I have seen and gave me a new and more pleasant idea of Odysseus. Weimar
2548,III,does not give the same impression of musty age as parts of Jena. It

2554,III,"“Another Goethe,” thought I; but I looked at it again, and it had not"
2555,III,that look of self-confident self-conscious greatness that all the
2556,III,Goethes have. So I went up to it and recognised a countryman--looking
2557,III,"down from this height on Weimar, with one eye half-closed and an"
2558,III,attitude of head expressing amused and tolerant but penetrating
2559,III,interest. It was certainly the first satisfactory representation of
2560,III,"Shakespeare I have ever seen. It appears quite new, but I could not"
2561,III,discover the sculptor’s name. The one-eye-half-closed trick was most

2577,IV,thinks. Such people of undeveloped individuality tell me in return what
2578,IV,"“wir Deutschen” think, in a touching national spirit, which would have"
2579,IV,charmed Plato. But they don’t charm me. Indeed I see in them the very

2583,IV,get drunk with.” But such is only a small proportion and come from the
2584,IV,"north and west; they just show how Sedan has ruined one type of German,"
2585,IV,"for I’m sure the German nature is the nicest in the world, as far as it"
2586,IV,is not warped by the German Empire. I like their lack of reserve and
2587,IV,"self-consciousness, our two national virtues. They all write poetry and"
2588,IV,recite it with gusto to any three hours’ old acquaintance. We all write

2597,IV,"might _qua_ might is right, but that confidence of superiority is right,"
2598,IV,"and by superiority she means spiritual superiority. She said to Belgium,"
2599,IV,“We enlightened thinkers see that it is necessary to the world that all
2600,IV,opposition to Deutsche Kultur should be crushed. As citizens of the
2601,IV,world you must assist us in our object and assert those higher ideas of
2602,IV,"world citizenship which are not bound by treaties. But if you oppose us,"
2603,IV,"we have only one alternative.” That, at least, is what the best of them"

2613,IV,
2614,IV,So it seems to me that Germany’s only fault (and I think you often
2615,IV,commented on it in those you met) is a lack of real insight and sympathy
2616,IV,"with those who differ from her. We are not fighting a bully, but a"
2617,IV,bigot. They are a young nation and don’t yet see that what they consider
2618,IV,is being done for the good of the world may be really being done for
2619,IV,"self-gratification--like X. who, under pretence of informing the form,"
2620,IV,dropped into the habit of parading his own knowledge. X. incidentally
2621,IV,"did the form a service by creating great amusement for it, and so is"
2622,IV,Germany incidentally doing the world a service (though not in the way it
2623,IV,"meant) by giving them something to live and die for, which no country"
2624,IV,but Germany had before. If the bigot conquers he will learn in time his
2625,IV,mistaken methods (for it is only of the methods and not of the goal of
2626,IV,Germany that one can disapprove)--just as the early Christian bigots
2627,IV,conquered by bigotry and grew larger in sympathy and tolerance after
2628,IV,"conquest. I regard the war as one between sisters, between Martha and"
2629,IV,"Mary, the efficient and intolerant against the casual and sympathetic."
2630,IV,"Each side has a virtue for which it is fighting, and each that virtue’s"
2631,IV,supplementary vice. And I hope that whatever the material result of the
2632,IV,"conflict, it will purge these two virtues of their vices, and efficiency"
2633,IV,and tolerance will no longer be incompatible.
2634,IV,
2635,IV,"But I think that tolerance is the larger virtue of the two, and"
2636,IV,efficiency must be her servant. So I am quite glad to fight against this
2637,IV,rebellious servant. In fact I look at it this way. Suppose my platoon
2638,IV,were the world. Then my platoon sergeant would represent efficiency and
2639,IV,I would represent tolerance. And I always take the sternest measures to
2640,IV,keep my platoon sergeant in check! I fully appreciate the wisdom of the

2686,IV,that heat and crowding. The heat of the night is worse than the heat of
2687,IV,"the day, and geistige Getränke were verboten. Then the train would"
2688,IV,slowly move out into the darkness that led to Metz and an exact
2689,IV,reproduction of it would steam in and fill its place: and we watched the
2690,IV,"signal on the southward side of Trier, till the lights should give a"
2691,IV,jump and the finger drop and let in the train which was to carry us out
2692,IV,of that highly-strung and thrilling land.

2694,IV,At Cologne I saw a herd of some thirty American school-pmarms whom I had
2695,IV,assisted to entertain at Eucken’s just a fortnight before. I shouted out
2696,IV,"to them, but they were far too upset to take any notice, but went"
2697,IV,bobbing into one compartment and out again and into another like people
2698,IV,in a cinematograph. Their haste anxiety and topsyturviness were caused
2699,IV,"by thoughts of their own safety and escape, and though perfectly natural"
2700,IV,contrasted so strangely with all the many other signs of haste
2701,IV,"perturbation and distress that I had seen, which were much quieter and"
2702,IV,"stronger and more full-bodied than that of those Americans, because it"
2703,IV,was the Vaterland and not the individual that was darting about and
2704,IV,looking for the way and was in need: and the silent submissive
2705,IV,unquestioning faces of the dark uprooted Italians peering from the
2706,IV,squeaking trucks formed a fitting background--Cassandra from the
2707,IV,backmost car looking steadily down on Agamemnon as he stepped from his
2708,IV,triumphal purple chariot and Clytemnestra offered him her hand. (_23

2713,IV,It is surprising how very little difference a total change of
2714,IV,circumstances and prospects makes in the individual. The German (I know
2715,IV,"from the 48 hours of the war that I spent there) is radically changed,"
2716,IV,"and until he is sent to the front, his one dream and thought will be how"
2717,IV,quickest to die for his country. He is able more clearly to see the
2718,IV,"tremendous issues, and changes accordingly. I don’t know whether it is"
2719,IV,because the English are more phlegmatic or more shortsighted or more
2720,IV,"egoistic or what, that makes them inwardly and outwardly so far less"
2721,IV,"shaken by the war than at first seemed probable. The German, I am sure,"
2722,IV,during the period of training “dies daily” until he is allowed to die.

2727,IV,We had a very swinging Christmas--one that makes one realize (in common
2728,IV,with other incidents of the war) how near savages we are and how much
2729,IV,the stomach (which Nietzsche calls the Father of Melancholy) is also the
2730,IV,best procurer of enjoyment. We gave the men a good church--plenty of
2731,IV,"loud hymns--, a good dinner--plenty of beer--, and the rest of the day"
2732,IV,was spent in sleep. I saw then very clearly that whereas for the upper
2733,IV,classes Christmas is a spiritual debauch in which one remembers for a
2734,IV,"day to be generous and cheerful and open-handed, it is only a more or"
2735,IV,"less physical debauch for the poorer classes, who need no reminder,"
2736,IV,since they are generous and cheerful and open-handed all the year round.
2737,IV,"One has fairly good chances of observing the life of the barrack-room,"
2738,IV,and what a contrast to the life of a house in a public school! The
2739,IV,system is roughly the same: the house-master or platoon-commander
2740,IV,"entrusts the discipline of his charge to prefects or corporals, as the"
2741,IV,case may be. They never open their mouths in the barrack-room without
2742,IV,the introduction of the unprintable swear-words and epithets: they have
2743,IV,"absolutely no “morality” (in the narrower, generally accepted sense):"
2744,IV,yet the public school boy should live among them to learn a little
2745,IV,Christianity: for they are so extraordinarily nice to one another. They
2746,IV,live in and for the present: we in and for the future. So they are
2747,IV,cheerful and charitable always: and we often niggardly and unkind and
2748,IV,"spiteful. In the gymnasium at Marlborough, how the few clumsy specimens"
2749,IV,are ragged and despised and jeered at by the rest of the squad; in the
2750,IV,gymnasium here you should hear the sounding cheer given to the man who
2751,IV,has tried for eight weeks to make a long-jump of eight feet and at last
2752,IV,by the advice and assistance of others has succeeded. They seem
2753,IV,"instinctively to regard a man singly, at his own rate, by his own"
2754,IV,"standards and possibilities, not in comparison with themselves or"
2755,IV,others: that’s why they are so far ahead of us in their treatment and
2756,IV,sizing up of others.
2757,IV,
2758,IV,"It’s very interesting, what you say about Athens and Sparta, and England"
2759,IV,"and Germany. Curious, isn’t it, that in old days a nation fought another"
2760,IV,for land or money: now we are fighting Germany for her spiritual
2761,IV,"qualities--thoroughness, and fearlessness of effort, and effacement of"
2762,IV,"the individual. I think that Germany, in spite of her vast bigotry and"
2763,IV,"blindness, is in a kind of way living up to the motto that Goethe left"
2764,IV,"her in the closing words of Faust, before he died."
2765,IV,

2810,VII,“ETERNALLY TO DO” (p. 71)
2811,VII,
2812,VII,Masefield has founded a new school of poetry and given a strange example
2813,VII,to future poets; and this is wherein his greatness and originality lies:
2814,VII,that he is a man of action not imagination. For he has one of the
2815,VII,fundamental qualities of a great poet--a thorough enjoyment of life. He
2816,VII,"has it in a more pre-eminent degree than even Browning, perhaps the"
2817,VII,stock instance of a poet who was great because he liked life. Everyone
2818,VII,"has read the latter’s lines about “the wild joys of living, the leaping"
2819,VII,from rock up to rock.” These are splendid lines: but one somehow does
2820,VII,not feel that Browning ever leapt from rock up to rock himself. He saw
2821,VII,"other people doing it, doubtless, and thought it fine. But I don’t think"
2822,VII,he did it himself ever....
2823,VII,
2824,VII,Masefield writes that he knows and testifies that he has seen.
2825,VII,"Throughout his poems there are lines and phrases so instinct with life,"
2826,VII,"that they betoken a man who writes of what he has experienced, not of"
2827,VII,"what he thinks he can imagine: who has braved the storm, who has walked"
2828,VII,"in the hells, who has seen the reality of life: who does not, like"
2829,VII,"Tennyson, shut off the world he has to write about, attempting to"
2830,VII,"imagine shipwrecks from the sofa, or battles in his bed. Compare for"
2831,VII,"instance _Enoch Arden_ and _Dauber_. One is a dream: the other, life...."
2832,VII,
2833,VII,"The sower, who reaps not, has found a voice at last--a harsh rough"
2834,VII,"voice, compelling, strong, triumphant. Let us, the reapers where we have"
2835,VII,"not sown, give ear to it. Are they not much better than we? The voice of"
2836,VII,our poets and men of letters is finely trained and sweet to hear; it
2837,VII,teems with sharp saws and rich sentiment: it is a marvel of delicate
2838,VII,"technique: it pleases, it flatters, it charms, it soothes: it is a"
2839,VII,living lie. The voice of John Masefield rings rough and ill trained: it
2840,VII,"tells a story, it leaves the thinking to the reader, it gives him no"
2841,VII,"dessert of sentiment, cut, dried,--and ready made to go to sleep on: it"
2842,VII,"jars, it grates, it makes him wonder; it is full of hope and faith and"
2843,VII,"power and strife and God. Till Mr Masefield came on earth, the poetry"
2844,VII,"of the world had been written by the men who lounged, who looked on. It"
2845,VII,"is sin in a man to write of the world before he has known the world, and"
2846,VII,the failing of every poet up till now has been that he has written of
2847,VII,what he loved to imagine but dared not to experience. But Masefield
2848,VII,writes that he knows and testifies that he has seen; with him expression
2849,VII,"is the fruit of action, the sweat of a body that has passed through the"
2850,VII,fire.
2851,VII,
2852,VII,We stand by the watershed of English poetry; for the vastness and wonder
2853,VII,of modern life has demanded that men should know what they write about.
2854,VII,Behind us are the poets of imagination; before us are the poets of fact.
2855,VII,"For Masefield as a poet may be bad or good: I think him good, but you"
2856,VII,"may think him bad: but, good or bad, he has got this quality which no"
2857,VII,one can deny and few belittle. He is the first of a multitude of coming
2858,VII,poets (so I trust and pray) who are men of action before they are men of
2859,VII,"speech and men of speech because they are men of action. Those whom,"
2860,VII,"because they do not live in our narrow painted groove, we call the Lower"
2861,VII,"Classes, it is they who truly know what life is: so to them let us look"
2862,VII,"for the true expression of life. One has already arisen, and his name is"
2863,VII,Masefield. We await the coming of others in his train. (_Essay on

3035,IX,"ill-temper drunkenness and premature old age--to wit, the making up of"
3036,IX,one’s own mind--is lifted from our shoulders. I can now understand the
3037,IX,"value of dogma, which is the General Commander-in-chief of the mind. I"
3038,IX,am now beginning to think that free thinkers should give their minds
3039,IX,"into subjection, for we who have given our actions and volitions into"
3040,IX,subjection gain such marvellous rest thereby. Only of course it is the
3041,IX,subjecting of their powers of will and deed to a wrong master on the
3042,IX,"part of a great nation that has led Europe into war. Perhaps afterwards,"
3043,IX,I and my likes will again become indiscriminate rebels. For the present
3044,IX,we find high relief in making ourselves soldiers. (_5 October 1915._)

3069,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",There is really very little to say about the life here. Change of
3070,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,","circumstance, I find, means little compared to change of company. And as"
3071,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",one has gone out and is still with the same officers with whom one had
3072,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,","rubbed shoulders unceasingly for the last nine months, and of whom one"
3073,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",had acquired that extraordinarily intimate knowledge which comes of
3074,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,","constant συυουσία, one does not notice the change: until one or two or"
3075,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",three drop off. And one wonders why.

3077,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,","They are extraordinarily close, really, these friendships of"
3078,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,","circumstance, distinct as they remain from friendships of choice...."
3079,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,","Only, I think, once or twice does one stumble across that person into"
3080,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,","whom one fits at once: to whom one can stand naked, all disclosed. But"
3081,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",circumstance provides the second best: and I’m sure that any gathering
3082,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",of men will in time lead to a very very close half-friendship between
3083,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",them all (I only say half-friendship because I wish to distinguish it
3084,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",from the other). So there has really been no change in coming over here:
3085,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",the change is to come when half of this improvised “band of brothers”
3086,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",are wiped away in a day. We are learning to be soldiers slowly--that is
3087,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,","to say, adopting the soldierly attitude of complete disconnection with"
3088,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",our job during odd hours. No shop. So when I think I should tell you
3089,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,","“something about the trenches,” I find I have neither the inclination"
3090,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",nor the power.
3091,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",
3092,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",This however. On our weekly march from the trenches back to our old
3093,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,","farmhouse a mile or two behind, we leave the communication-trench for a"
3094,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,","road, hedged on one side only, with open ploughland to the right. It"
3095,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",runs a little down hill till the road branches. Then half left up over
3096,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,","open country goes our track, with the ground shelving away to the right"

3098,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",on a small scale. There is something in the way that at the end of the
3099,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",hedge the road leaps up to the left into the beyond that puts me in mind
3100,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",of Trainers Down. It is what that turn into unhedged country and that
3101,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,","leap promises, not what it achieves, that makes the likeness. It is"
3102,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,","nothing when you get up, no wildness, no openness. But there it remains"
3103,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",to cheer me on each relief....
3104,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",
3105,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",I hear that a _very_ select group of public schools will by this time be
3106,"“PERHAPS THE ROAD UP ILSLEY WAY,",enjoying the Camp “somewhere in England.” May they not take it too
