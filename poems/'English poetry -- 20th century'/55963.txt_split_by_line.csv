242,THE STARRY LADY,Whose trumpets pealing
243,THE STARRY LADY,Peal through the sunset till
244,THE STARRY LADY,"Flower, tree and cloud and hill"
245,THE STARRY LADY,Fuse in the splendour of song that girdles the seas.
246,THE STARRY LADY,
247,THE STARRY LADY,The Sun now is set--and now
248,THE STARRY LADY,Lips on her calm cool brow!
249,THE STARRY LADY,Now there is heaping

251,THE STARRY LADY,With deep and drowsy scents
252,THE STARRY LADY,Their bodies sleeping.

258,THE STARRY LADY,"Still, in this solemn hour"
259,THE STARRY LADY,Lie cloud and flower;
260,THE STARRY LADY,"Still, most shadowy still"
261,THE STARRY LADY,Lie cloud and tree.
262,THE STARRY LADY,"Now under tranquil skies,"
263,THE STARRY LADY,"Far, far the Monarch lies"

303,A TREE BENDS STOOPING,Frozenly upright;
304,A TREE BENDS STOOPING,"And deeper, deeper you"
305,A TREE BENDS STOOPING,"Shall thick leaves hide from view,"
306,A TREE BENDS STOOPING,Your dead limbs shall be sunk
307,A TREE BENDS STOOPING,"Down further through the trunk,"
308,A TREE BENDS STOOPING,And all your veins shall wrap
309,A TREE BENDS STOOPING,"Channels of flowing sap,"
310,A TREE BENDS STOOPING,Your brain and lungs and blood
311,A TREE BENDS STOOPING,"Shall be stiff wood,"
312,A TREE BENDS STOOPING,Till you at last shall be
313,A TREE BENDS STOOPING,The cold heart of a tree.
314,A TREE BENDS STOOPING,
315,A TREE BENDS STOOPING,Beware!

325,THE MOON-CLOCK,
326,THE MOON-CLOCK,"Tick-tock! the moon, that pale round clock"
327,THE MOON-CLOCK,"Her big face peering, goes tick-tock!"
328,THE MOON-CLOCK,
329,THE MOON-CLOCK,Metallic as a grasshopper
330,THE MOON-CLOCK,The faint far tickings start and stir.
331,THE MOON-CLOCK,
332,THE MOON-CLOCK,All night tinily you can hear
333,THE MOON-CLOCK,Tick-tock tinkling down the sheer
334,THE MOON-CLOCK,
335,THE MOON-CLOCK,"Steep falls of space.  Minute, aloof,"
336,THE MOON-CLOCK,"Here is no praise, here no reproof."
337,THE MOON-CLOCK,
338,THE MOON-CLOCK,"Remote in voids star-purged of sense,"
339,THE MOON-CLOCK,Tick-tock in stark indifference!
340,THE MOON-CLOCK,
341,THE MOON-CLOCK,"From ice-black lands of lack and rock,"
342,THE MOON-CLOCK,The two swords shake and clank tick-tock.
343,THE MOON-CLOCK,
344,THE MOON-CLOCK,In the dark din of the day's vault
345,THE MOON-CLOCK,Demand thy headlong soul shall halt
346,THE MOON-CLOCK,
347,THE MOON-CLOCK,"One moment.  Hearken, taut and tense,"
348,THE MOON-CLOCK,"In the vast Silence beyond sense,"
349,THE MOON-CLOCK,
350,THE MOON-CLOCK,"The moon!  From the hushed heart of her,"
351,THE MOON-CLOCK,"Metallic as a grasshopper,"
352,THE MOON-CLOCK,
353,THE MOON-CLOCK,"Patient though earth may writhe and rock,"
354,THE MOON-CLOCK,"Imperturbably, tock, tick-tock!"
355,THE MOON-CLOCK,
356,THE MOON-CLOCK,"Till, boastful earth, your forests wilt"
357,THE MOON-CLOCK,"In grotesque Death.  Till Death shall silt,"
358,THE MOON-CLOCK,
359,THE MOON-CLOCK,"Loud-blooded man, her unchecked sands"
360,THE MOON-CLOCK,From feet and warped expiring hands
361,THE MOON-CLOCK,
362,THE MOON-CLOCK,Through fatuous channels of the thinned
363,THE MOON-CLOCK,Brain.  Till all the clangours which have dinned
364,THE MOON-CLOCK,
365,THE MOON-CLOCK,"Through your arched ears are only this,"
366,THE MOON-CLOCK,"Tick-tock down blank eternities,"
367,THE MOON-CLOCK,
368,THE MOON-CLOCK,Where still the sallow death's-head ticks
369,THE MOON-CLOCK,As stars burn down like candle-wicks.

378,UNNAMED FRUIT,"What fruit grows viewless in my garden plot,"
379,UNNAMED FRUIT,"So red the sun is shamed,"
380,UNNAMED FRUIT,Tipped with green starshine and with opal flamed!
381,UNNAMED FRUIT,Days shall not rot
382,UNNAMED FRUIT,My fruit so sacred that it is not named.
383,UNNAMED FRUIT,
384,UNNAMED FRUIT,Not with a carnal lip shalt thou devour
385,UNNAMED FRUIT,A pulp so tragic-sweet.
386,UNNAMED FRUIT,For here the juices of disaster meet
387,UNNAMED FRUIT,When silly power
388,UNNAMED FRUIT,Gives form to fancy that a man might eat.
389,UNNAMED FRUIT,
390,UNNAMED FRUIT,Leave us a single tree of precious fruit;
391,UNNAMED FRUIT,One dream to be our own;
392,UNNAMED FRUIT,One shape which shall not stammer into stone;

422,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
423,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,The shepherd sings:
424,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"""_Way down in Dixie,"
425,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Way down in Dixie,"
426,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Where the hens are dog-gone glad to lay..._"""
427,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
428,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,With shaded eyes he stands to look
429,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Across the hills where the clouds swoon,"
430,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"He singing, leans upon his crook,"
431,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"He sings, he sings no more."
432,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,The wind is muffled in the tangled hair
433,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Of sheep that drift along the noon.
434,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,The mild sheep stare
435,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,With amber eyes about the pearl-flecked June.
436,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Two skylarks soar
437,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,With singing flame
438,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Into the sun whence first they came.
439,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,All else is only grasshoppers
440,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Or a brown wing the shepherd stirs,"
441,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Who, like a slow tree moving, goes"
442,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Where the pale tide of sheep-drift flows.
443,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
444,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,See! the sun smites
445,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,With molten lights
446,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,The turned wing of a gull that glows
447,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Aslant the violet, the profound"
448,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Dome of the mid-June heights.
449,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Alas! again the grasshoppers,"
450,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"The birds, the slumber-winging bees,"
451,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Alas! again for those and these
452,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Demure things drowned;
453,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Drowned in vain raucous words men made
454,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Where no lark rose with swift and sweet
455,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Ascent and where no dim sheep strayed
456,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"About the stone immensities,"
457,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Where no sheep strayed and where no bees
458,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Probed any flowers nor swung a blade
459,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Of grass with pollened feet.
460,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
461,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,He sings
462,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"""_In Dixie,"

466,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
467,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,The herring-gulls with peevish cries
468,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Rebuke the man who sings vain words;
469,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"His sheep-dog growls a low complaint,"
470,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Then turns to chasing butterflies.
471,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,But when the indifferent singing-birds
472,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,From midmost down to dimmest shore
473,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Innumerably confirm their songs,"
474,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,And grasshoppers make summer rhyme
475,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,And solemn bees in the wild thyme
476,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Clash cymbals and beat gongs,"
477,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"The shepherd's words once more are faint,"
478,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Once more the alien song is thinned
479,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Upon the long course of the wind,"
480,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"He sings, he sings no more."
481,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
482,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Ah now the dear monotonies
483,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Of bells that jangle on the sheep
484,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,To the low limit of the hills!
485,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Till the blue cup of music spills
486,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Into the boughs of lowland trees;
487,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Till thence the lowland singings creep
488,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Into the dreamful shepherd's head,"
489,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Creep drowsily through his blood;
490,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"The young thrush fluting all he knows,"
491,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"The ring dove moaning his false woes,"
492,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Almost the rabbit's tiny tread,"

494,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
495,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"But now,"
496,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Now a cool word spreads out along the sea.
497,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Now the day's violet is cloud-tipped with gold.
498,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Now dusk most silently
499,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Fills the hushed day with other wings than birds'.
500,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Now where on foam-crest waves the seagulls rock,"
501,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,To their cliff-haven go the seagulls thence.
502,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"So too the shepherd gathers in his flock,"
503,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Because birds journey to their dens,"
504,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Tired sheep to their still fold.
505,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
506,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,A dark first bat swoops low and dips
507,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,About the shepherd who now sings
508,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,A song of timeless evenings;
509,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"For dusk is round him with wide wings,"
510,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Dusk murmurs on his moving lips.
511,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
512,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,_There is not mortal man who knows
513,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,From whence the shepherd's song arose:
514,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,It came a thousand years ago._
515,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
516,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,_Once the world's shepherds woke to lead
517,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,The folded sheep that they might feed
518,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,On green downs where winds blow._
519,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
520,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,_One shepherd sang a golden word.
521,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,A thousand miles away one heard.
522,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"One sang it swift, one sang it slow._"
523,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
524,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"_Two skylarks heard, two skylarks told"
525,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,All shepherds this same song of gold
526,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,On all downs where winds blow._
527,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
528,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,_This is the song that shepherds must
529,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,Sing till the green downlands be dust
530,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,And tide of sheep-drift no more flow;_
531,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,
532,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,_The song two skylarks told again

543,SKYLARK NOON,With stars of light.
544,SKYLARK NOON,"I am loosened, I fly"
545,SKYLARK NOON,Till never a lark is near to the sun as I.
546,SKYLARK NOON,Now through the steeps of air do my swift wings cut.
547,SKYLARK NOON,My wings are seen and not seen
548,SKYLARK NOON,"Even as dawn-drenched waters that twinkle and shut,"
549,SKYLARK NOON,As I rise to the tops of the noon where no bird has been.
550,SKYLARK NOON,Fleet
551,SKYLARK NOON,My wings beat.
552,SKYLARK NOON,"I climb, I climb"
553,SKYLARK NOON,High hills of noon that soar from the plains of Time.
554,SKYLARK NOON,But lo!
555,SKYLARK NOON,"As I go,"
556,SKYLARK NOON,"Half flame, half snow,"
557,SKYLARK NOON,So far through unwinged places that even the brown
558,SKYLARK NOON,Larks of the dwindling down
559,SKYLARK NOON,"Are as dust, and dimmer than dust are men and town--"
560,SKYLARK NOON,"Who are these, who are these"
561,SKYLARK NOON,New larks whose song is so proud
562,SKYLARK NOON,That my own is cowed?
563,SKYLARK NOON,"From what lands, what seas"
564,SKYLARK NOON,Have they flown with song so kingly my weak songs fade;
565,SKYLARK NOON,Such song as no bird has made
566,SKYLARK NOON,Though Love called long in Spring and his heart obeyed?
567,SKYLARK NOON,
568,SKYLARK NOON,Such song is theirs as the winds have always sought
569,SKYLARK NOON,But the winds not found;
570,SKYLARK NOON,Such song as the seas at dawn have almost caught
571,SKYLARK NOON,Ere the song was drowned;
572,SKYLARK NOON,"Such song as no birds achieve,"
573,SKYLARK NOON,"Though nightingale may grieve,"
574,SKYLARK NOON,"And lyric thrush may scold,"
575,SKYLARK NOON,And blackbird make so bold
576,SKYLARK NOON,As to declare this silver and his own song gold.
577,SKYLARK NOON,Who are these whose singings here
578,SKYLARK NOON,"Compass the noon with splendour, but my heart with fear,"
579,SKYLARK NOON,"Lest I, unworth this height,"
580,SKYLARK NOON,Drop through narrowing deeps of unplumbed night?
581,SKYLARK NOON,
582,SKYLARK NOON,Lo! the dead poets they
583,SKYLARK NOON,"Who passed through flesh this way,"
584,SKYLARK NOON,These with no lips of clay
585,SKYLARK NOON,Now sing supremest song throughout the duskless day.
586,SKYLARK NOON,In the music now they make
587,SKYLARK NOON,My own few notes forsake
588,SKYLARK NOON,My heart that rocks in silence as a lone bird on a lake.
589,SKYLARK NOON,I vail within my wings
590,SKYLARK NOON,I vail my head in worship before the poet kings;
591,SKYLARK NOON,Until from the far brink
592,SKYLARK NOON,Of this last Song whence I shrink
593,SKYLARK NOON,Ah slowly now and slowly down the tall noon I sink.
594,SKYLARK NOON,
595,SKYLARK NOON,"So am I wrapped in quiet, still trancèd by their Word,"
596,SKYLARK NOON,Until I reach the airs
597,SKYLARK NOON,Where a mortal skylark fares
598,SKYLARK NOON,But not in his first rapture shall match his song with theirs!
599,SKYLARK NOON,"And now my feet are fallen, I am no more a bird,"
600,SKYLARK NOON,Now for my little seeing the high gold noon is blurred;
601,SKYLARK NOON,For now where grey roads wind
602,SKYLARK NOON,I walk the low world mutely among my human kind.

1003,PEACE,
1004,PEACE,The singings of the singing birds

1011,PEACE,There was no living fount that shook

1013,PEACE,
1014,PEACE,One Man was Christ.  Around His head
1015,PEACE,The jagged thorns were keen.
1016,PEACE,But all the blood His body shed
1017,PEACE,Made not the foul world clean.
1018,PEACE,
1019,PEACE,One Man was Everyman.  He went

1063,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,(_For Neville Whymant_)
1064,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,
1065,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,The sun setting down the suburb holds
1066,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Impermanent crimsons and elusive golds.
1067,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,See the false banners! folds on magic folds
1068,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Sway down deluded streets!
1069,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Refuse and ruin now most featly kissed
1070,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,By lips flushed amethyst!
1071,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"The walls are shimmered with a vaporous dusk,"
1072,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,A glamour glooms
1073,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,The sorrowful pale husk
1074,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,With rich twilight of witchcraft blooms.
1075,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Ah! spurious wizardry that flows and fleets
1076,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Where sword-gems flash and melt in a moon-mist!
1077,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,
1078,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,The roofs so ashen-dark of old
1079,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Flare down the streets like lifted brands,"
1080,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Flare like the burning arc of sands
1081,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Where the recurrent seas have rolled
1082,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Long breakers molten from astounding gold
1083,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,
1084,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,The chimneys which all day
1085,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Scowling have stood
1086,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Against the devouring mills,"
1087,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Boding no thought of good
1088,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,For whoso came that way--
1089,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Lo now! from evil thought
1090,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Soaring through steeps of fire their brows are caught.
1091,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,
1092,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Columnar topaz in this time of shrift,"
1093,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Their tall heads lift
1094,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Among the bases of celestial hills.
1095,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,
1096,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Ah streets, rent roofs, ah chimneys, I am blind!"
1097,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,I dare not find
1098,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,You lifted so from purgatorial dooms.
1099,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,I cannot breathe.
1100,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Hold me!  I sink where the dense colour fumes!
1101,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Now opiate hands close round me, draw me down,"
1102,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Foam-lulled where soundless tides of sunset seethe!
1103,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Hold me!  I drown!
1104,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,
1105,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,My eyes open! ah so wretched eyes!
1106,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Have ye no gift to steep
1107,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Your seeing in swart sleep?
1108,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Cannot your harsh lids close
1109,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Tighter than midnight knows,"
1110,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Make sleep a burial whence the last star dies?
1111,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Now ebbing like the blood in a faint pulse,"
1112,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Relentless, with no pause,"
1113,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Shorn of the lying sapphires, aureate cheats,"
1114,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,The glamorous tide withdraws.
1115,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,The false sky dulls
1116,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,From redmost roses into drooping weeds.
1117,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Ah dying beauty now that dying bleeds,"
1118,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Your banners fail in dust!
1119,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,A slow rot gnaws
1120,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,The disillusioned roofs with teeth of rust.
1121,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Now chimneys reassume
1122,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Their ominous dark doom.
1123,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,
1124,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Sick grey, sick brown and grey once more are penned"
1125,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Within the network of the haggard streets.
1126,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,The suburb stretches drably to life's end!
1127,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,
1128,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Like sheep in a mange-ridden flock
1129,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Once more the aimless houses sprawl
1130,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Along the dishevelled streets,"
1131,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Where grocers shew their flyblown stock,"
1132,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Where butchers shew their pulpy meats,"
1133,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Where down a tin-heaped backyard wall
1134,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Thin cats and women call.
1135,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,As night comes close the suburb flares
1136,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,To petty sins and cheap carouse
1137,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Along its foolish thoroughfares.
1138,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,The smirking adolescents stand
1139,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,About the corners in coarse groups.
1140,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Somewhere a blind knocks like a hand,"
1141,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"A lodger rings a stuttering bell,"
1142,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,A stray tree mutely droops thin boughs.
1143,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,A window opening throws a smell
1144,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,From kitchens where smeared saucepans boil
1145,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Their quarts of scurfy soups.
1146,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,An unlatched door swings wide and wails.
1147,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,A patch of wilted grass exhales
1148,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Scents not of dust nor dustless soil.
1149,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,
1150,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,For lo! this twofold sorrow was set down
1151,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"On the doomed suburb till the last of days,"
1152,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Which hath been placed in intermediate ways
1153,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Between two bournes from which her heart is sealed:
1154,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"The intimate keep of the far midmost town,"
1155,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,The green quick raptures of far outmost field.
1156,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,
1157,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,She knows not the heart throbbing nor the tense
1158,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Roads shimmering where the hundred thousand feet
1159,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Make thunders where they meet.
1160,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Nor tumult storming in loud sense on sense:
1161,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Eyes where the profligate hues
1162,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Mingle in whirlpools of untamed delight,"
1163,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Where scarlet or shrill green pursues
1164,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Purples and yellows and star-blues,"
1165,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,And find or lose
1166,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Their bodies in white day or profound night;
1167,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Smells of strange spices from uncharted lands,"
1168,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Of blood on unwiped hands,"
1169,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Of woman's hair, of ripe flamboyant flowers,"
1170,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Of buildings leaping to the displaced skies,"
1171,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Of all the body's and soul's mad merchandise
1172,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Sold through the crowded unremitting hours;
1173,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Sounds of innumerable singings since the dawn
1174,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Came dancing and, her gown withdrawn,"
1175,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Her white breasts blinded night's most impotent eyes;
1176,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Cracked murmurs of pale harlots in their beds,"
1177,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Who have paid more than gold for nothing bought;
1178,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,The mumbling of old women with drooped heads
1179,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Who are defeated though they sternly fought;
1180,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Music and terror and the shock of wings!--
1181,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Not these she knows--colours and sounds and smells,"
1182,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"The conjoint heavens and the massed hells,"
1183,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"No, not these things!"
1184,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,
1185,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Not these she knows,--nor these, nor these:"
1186,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"The snowdrops under the dark yews,"
1187,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,The challenge on the young lips borne
1188,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Of brave blackthorn
1189,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Against the jagged teeth and the harsh beard
1190,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Of winter seared.
1191,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Nor primroses washed with sweet dews,"
1192,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Nor daffodils where bees are stuck
1193,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Who probe too deeply for their sweet,"
1194,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Nor celandine whence they refuse
1195,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,To move until they suck
1196,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Their heads drunk and a stupor to their feet.
1197,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Ah the dog-violets on low hills
1198,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,And woodland sorrel in deep woods
1199,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,And blackbirds with fine yellow bills
1200,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,And thrushes of a thousand moods
1201,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,And nesting-time when these make rhyme
1202,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Amid the youngling leaves that climb
1203,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,On sycamores and chestnut trees!
1204,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Not these she knows, not these!"
1205,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,She hath not seen the kingfisher
1206,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,By willowed waters dart blue fires.
1207,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,She hath not seen the skylark stir
1208,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"When a sheep's foot came near his nest,"
1209,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,And rise to lead the morning choirs
1210,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,From flushed East to pale West.
1211,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Nor all the blossoms of all fruit,"
1212,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Apple and pear and rosy peach,"
1213,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Nor, palisaded from man's reach"
1214,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Behind a guard of frowning fir,"
1215,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Wild cherry tipped with dawn.
1216,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Nor heard grass-belfries chink and chime
1217,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"When poplars sway like a slim faun,"
1218,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Nor known the tardy oak-tree suit
1219,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,His body to the crescent time.
1220,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,
1221,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Not these things and not these she knows
1222,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Behind her rampart of pale woes,"
1223,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,For she with twofold grief is sealed
1224,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,From midmost town and outmost field.
1225,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Ah sunset! thou who lying came
1226,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"To flood her streets with traitor flame,"
1227,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Come thou no more
1228,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,With gilded lies!
1229,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Her heart is numbed, her eyes are sore,"
1230,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Her heart is troubled with sick shame.
1231,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Open no more
1232,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,One fitful instant the wild door
1233,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Which brought one breeze of Paradise.
1234,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,In this dun midway where she lies
1235,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,Each day a twofold death she dies.
1236,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,"Thou false and lovely, come no more"
1237,SUNSET OVER SUBURB,With warm wings touched of Paradise!

1249,SHRIFT AMONG HILLS,Among clean winds he bends his brows.
