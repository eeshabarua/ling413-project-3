137,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,Speak not--whisper not;
138,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,Here bloweth thyme and bergamot;
139,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Softly on the evening hour,"
140,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Secret herbs their spices shower,"
141,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Dark-spiked rosemary and myrrh,"
142,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Lean-stalked, purple lavender;"
143,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Hides within her bosom, too,"
144,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"All her sorrows, bitter rue."
145,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,
146,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,Breathe not--trespass not;
147,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Of this green and darkling spot,"
148,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Latticed from the moon’s beams,"
149,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,Perchance a distant dreamer dreams;
150,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Perchance upon its darkening air,"
151,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"The unseen ghosts of children fare,"
152,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Faintly swinging, sway and sweep,"
153,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,Like lovely sea-flowers in its deep;
154,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"While, unmoved, to watch and ward,"
155,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"’Mid its gloom’d and daisied sward,"
156,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,Stands with bowed and dewy head
157,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,That one little leaden Lad.

165,THE RIDDLERS,"‘Thou solitary!’ the Blackbird cried,"
166,THE RIDDLERS,"‘I, from the happy Wren,"
167,THE RIDDLERS,"Linnet and Blackcap, Woodlark, Thrush,"
168,THE RIDDLERS,"Perched all upon a sweetbrier bush,"
169,THE RIDDLERS,Have come at cold of midnight-tide
170,THE RIDDLERS,"To ask thee, Why and when"
171,THE RIDDLERS,Grief smote thy heart so thou dost sing
172,THE RIDDLERS,"In solemn hush of evening,"
173,THE RIDDLERS,"So sorrowfully, lovelorn Thing--"
174,THE RIDDLERS,"Nay, nay, not sing, but rave, but wail,"
175,THE RIDDLERS,Most melancholic Nightingale?
176,THE RIDDLERS,Do not the dews of darkness steep
177,THE RIDDLERS,All pinings of the day in sleep?
178,THE RIDDLERS,"Why, then, when rocked in starry nest"
179,THE RIDDLERS,"We mutely couch, secure, at rest,"
180,THE RIDDLERS,Doth thy lone heart delight to make
181,THE RIDDLERS,Music for sorrow’s sake?’
182,THE RIDDLERS,
183,THE RIDDLERS,"A Moon was there. So still her beam,"
184,THE RIDDLERS,"It seemed the whole world lay a-dream,"
185,THE RIDDLERS,Lulled by the watery sea.
186,THE RIDDLERS,And from her leafy night-hung nook
187,THE RIDDLERS,Upon this stranger soft did look
188,THE RIDDLERS,The Nightingale: sighed he:--
189,THE RIDDLERS,
190,THE RIDDLERS,"‘’Tis strange, my friend; the Kingfisher"
191,THE RIDDLERS,But yestermorn conjured me here
192,THE RIDDLERS,Out of his green and gold to say
193,THE RIDDLERS,"Why thou, in splendour of the noon"
194,THE RIDDLERS,Wearest of colour but golden shoon.
195,THE RIDDLERS,And else dost thee array
196,THE RIDDLERS,In a most sombre suit of black?
197,THE RIDDLERS,"“Surely,” he sighed, “some load of grief,"
198,THE RIDDLERS,Past all our thinking--and belief--
199,THE RIDDLERS,Must weigh upon his back!”
200,THE RIDDLERS,"Do, then, in turn, tell me,--If joy"
201,THE RIDDLERS,"Thy heart as well as voice employ,"
202,THE RIDDLERS,"Why dost thou now, most Sable, shine"
203,THE RIDDLERS,In plumage woefuller far than mine?
204,THE RIDDLERS,Thy silence is a sadder thing
205,THE RIDDLERS,Than any dirge I sing!’
206,THE RIDDLERS,
207,THE RIDDLERS,"Thus then these two small birds, perched there,"
208,THE RIDDLERS,Breathed a strange riddle both did share
209,THE RIDDLERS,Yet neither could expound.
210,THE RIDDLERS,"And we--who sing but as we can,"
211,THE RIDDLERS,In the small knowledge of a man--
212,THE RIDDLERS,Have we an answer found?
213,THE RIDDLERS,"Nay, some are happy whose delight"
214,THE RIDDLERS,Is hid even from themselves from sight;
215,THE RIDDLERS,And some win peace who spend
216,THE RIDDLERS,The skill of words to sweeten despair
217,THE RIDDLERS,Of finding consolation where
218,THE RIDDLERS,Life has but one dark end;
219,THE RIDDLERS,"Who, in rapt solitude, tell o’er"
220,THE RIDDLERS,A tale as lovely as forlore
221,THE RIDDLERS,Into the midnight air.

232,MRS. GRUNDY,Still even thy heart! What seest thou?’
233,MRS. GRUNDY,
234,MRS. GRUNDY,"‘High coifed, broad-browed, aged, suave yet grim,"
235,MRS. GRUNDY,"A large flat face, eyes keenly dim,"
236,MRS. GRUNDY,"Staring at nothing--that’s me!--and yet,"
237,MRS. GRUNDY,"With a hate one could never, no, never forget....’"
238,MRS. GRUNDY,
239,MRS. GRUNDY,"‘This is my world, my garden, my home,"
240,MRS. GRUNDY,Hither my father bade mother to come
241,MRS. GRUNDY,"And bear me out of the dark into light,"
242,MRS. GRUNDY,And happy I was in her tender sight.
243,MRS. GRUNDY,
244,MRS. GRUNDY,"‘And then, thou frail flower, she died and went,"
245,MRS. GRUNDY,"Forgetting my pitiless banishment,"
246,MRS. GRUNDY,"And that Old Woman--an Aunt--she said,"
247,MRS. GRUNDY,"Came hither, lodged, fattened, and made her bed."
248,MRS. GRUNDY,
249,MRS. GRUNDY,"‘Oh yes, thou most blessed, from Monday to Sunday"
250,MRS. GRUNDY,"Has lived on me, preyed on me, Mrs. Grundy:"
251,MRS. GRUNDY,"Called me, “dear Nephew”; on each of those chairs"
252,MRS. GRUNDY,"Has gloated in righteousness, heard my prayers."
253,MRS. GRUNDY,
254,MRS. GRUNDY,"‘Why didst thou dare the thorns of the grove,"
255,MRS. GRUNDY,"Timidest trespasser, huntress of love?"
256,MRS. GRUNDY,"Now thou has peeped, and now dost know"
257,MRS. GRUNDY,What kind of creature is thine for foe.
258,MRS. GRUNDY,
259,MRS. GRUNDY,"‘Not that she’ll tear out thy innocent eyes,"
260,MRS. GRUNDY,Poison thy mouth with deviltries.
261,MRS. GRUNDY,"Watch thou, wait thou: soon will begin"
262,MRS. GRUNDY,"The guile of a voice: hark!... “Come in, Come in!”’"

279,THE DARK HOUSE,"‘Secrets,’ sighs the night-wind,"
280,THE DARK HOUSE,‘Vacancy is all I find;
281,THE DARK HOUSE,Every keyhole I have made
282,THE DARK HOUSE,"Wail a summons, faint and sad,"
283,THE DARK HOUSE,"No voice ever answers me,"
284,THE DARK HOUSE,Only vacancy.’
285,THE DARK HOUSE,"‘Once, once ...’ the cricket shrills,"

287,THE DARK HOUSE,"With its tiny voice, and then"
288,THE DARK HOUSE,Hush falls again.

294,THE DARK HOUSE,"Some minutest atom shake,"

314,MISTRESS FELL,"Only this I surely know,"
315,MISTRESS FELL,"When his voice called me, I must go;"
316,MISTRESS FELL,"Touched me his fingers, and my heart"

321,MISTRESS FELL,"Stranger, he was fast asleep;"
322,MISTRESS FELL,Into his dream I tried to creep;
323,MISTRESS FELL,"Called his name, soft was my cry:"
324,MISTRESS FELL,He answered--not one sigh.

326,MISTRESS FELL,‘The flower and the thorn are here;
327,MISTRESS FELL,"Falleth the night-dew, cold and clear;"

335,MISTRESS FELL,Not tears I give; but all that he
336,MISTRESS FELL,Clasped in his arms sweet charity;
337,MISTRESS FELL,All that he loved--to him I bring
338,MISTRESS FELL,For a close whispering.’

350,THE STRANGER,
351,THE STRANGER,"Spurred his heel, dark his cloak,"
352,THE STRANGER,Shady-wide his bonnet’s brim;
353,THE STRANGER,His horse beneath a silvery oak
354,THE STRANGER,Grazed as I talked with him.
355,THE STRANGER,
356,THE STRANGER,Softly his breast-brooch burned and shone;
357,THE STRANGER,Hill and deep were in his eyes;
358,THE STRANGER,"One of his hands held mine, and one"
359,THE STRANGER,The fruit that makes men wise.

365,THE STRANGER,
366,THE STRANGER,Dews were still betwixt us twain;

400,THE REMONSTRANCE,"I lived in quiet; cold, content;"
401,THE REMONSTRANCE,"All longing in safe banishment,"
402,THE REMONSTRANCE,Until your ghostly lips and eyes
403,THE REMONSTRANCE,Made wisdom unwise.
404,THE REMONSTRANCE,
405,THE REMONSTRANCE,Naught was in me to tempt your feet
406,THE REMONSTRANCE,To seek a lodging. Quite forgot
407,THE REMONSTRANCE,Lay the sweet solitude we two
408,THE REMONSTRANCE,In childhood used to wander through;
409,THE REMONSTRANCE,Time’s cold had closed my heart about;
410,THE REMONSTRANCE,And shut you out.
411,THE REMONSTRANCE,
412,THE REMONSTRANCE,"Well, and what then?... O vision grave,"
413,THE REMONSTRANCE,Take all the little all I have!
414,THE REMONSTRANCE,Strip me of what in voiceless thought
415,THE REMONSTRANCE,"Life’s kept of life, unhoped, unsought!--"
416,THE REMONSTRANCE,Reverie and dream that memory must
417,THE REMONSTRANCE,Hide deep in dust!
418,THE REMONSTRANCE,
419,THE REMONSTRANCE,"This only I say,--Though cold and bare"
420,THE REMONSTRANCE,"The haunted house you have chosen to share,"
421,THE REMONSTRANCE,Still ’neath its walls the moonbeam goes
422,THE REMONSTRANCE,And trembles on the untended rose;
423,THE REMONSTRANCE,Still o’er its broken roof-tree rise
424,THE REMONSTRANCE,The starry arches of the skies;
425,THE REMONSTRANCE,And ’neath your lightest word shall be
426,THE REMONSTRANCE,The thunder of an ebbing sea.
