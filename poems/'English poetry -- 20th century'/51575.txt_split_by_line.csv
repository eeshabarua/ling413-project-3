677,THE NEW MIRACLE,"The hearthstone’s commerce between mate and mate,"
678,THE NEW MIRACLE,"Barren of wonder, prospered in content,"
679,THE NEW MIRACLE,And still the hunger of their thought was great
680,THE NEW MIRACLE,For sweet astonishment.
681,THE NEW MIRACLE,
682,THE NEW MIRACLE,And so they built them altars of retreat
683,THE NEW MIRACLE,"Where life’s familiar use was overthrown,"
684,THE NEW MIRACLE,"And left the shining world about their feet,"
685,THE NEW MIRACLE,To travel worlds unknown.
686,THE NEW MIRACLE,
687,THE NEW MIRACLE,*       *       *       *       *
688,THE NEW MIRACLE,
689,THE NEW MIRACLE,We hunger still. But wonder has come down
690,THE NEW MIRACLE,From alien skies upon the midst of us;
691,THE NEW MIRACLE,The sparkling hedgerow and the clamorous town
692,THE NEW MIRACLE,Have grown miraculous.
693,THE NEW MIRACLE,
694,THE NEW MIRACLE,And man from his far travelling returns
695,THE NEW MIRACLE,"To find yet stranger wisdom than he sought,"
696,THE NEW MIRACLE,Where in the habit of his threshold burns
697,THE NEW MIRACLE,Unfathomable thought.

703,REVERIE,
704,REVERIE,
705,REVERIE,"Here in the unfrequented noon,"
706,REVERIE,"In the green hermitage of June,"
707,REVERIE,While overhead a rustling wing
708,REVERIE,Minds me of birds that do not sing
709,REVERIE,Until the cooler eve rewakes
710,REVERIE,"The service of melodious brakes,"
711,REVERIE,"And thoughts are lonely rangers, here,"
712,REVERIE,"In shelter of the primrose year,"
713,REVERIE,I curiously meditate
714,REVERIE,Our brief and variable state.
715,REVERIE,
716,REVERIE,I think how many are alive
717,REVERIE,"Who better in the grave would thrive,"
718,REVERIE,If some so long a sleep might give
719,REVERIE,Better instruction how to live;
720,REVERIE,I think what splendours had been said
721,REVERIE,By darlings now untimely dead
722,REVERIE,"Had death been wise in choice of these,"
723,REVERIE,And made exchange of obsequies.
724,REVERIE,
725,REVERIE,I think what loss to government
726,REVERIE,It is that good men are content--
727,REVERIE,Well knowing that an evil will
728,REVERIE,"Is folly-stricken too, and still"
729,REVERIE,Itself considers only wise
730,REVERIE,For all rebukes and surgeries--
731,REVERIE,That evil men should raise their pride
732,REVERIE,To place and fortune undefied.
733,REVERIE,I think how daily we beguile
734,REVERIE,"Our brains, that yet a little while"
735,REVERIE,And all our congregated schemes
736,REVERIE,"And our perplexity of dreams,"
737,REVERIE,Shall come to whole and perfect state.
738,REVERIE,"I think, however long the date"
739,REVERIE,"Of life may be, at last the sun"
740,REVERIE,Shall pass upon campaigns undone.
741,REVERIE,
742,REVERIE,I look upon the world and see
743,REVERIE,"A world colonial to me,"
744,REVERIE,"Whereof I am the architect,"
745,REVERIE,"And principal and intellect,"
746,REVERIE,A world whose shape and savour spring
747,REVERIE,"Out of my lone imagining,"
748,REVERIE,A world whose nature is subdued
749,REVERIE,"For ever to my instant mood,"
750,REVERIE,And only beautiful can be
751,REVERIE,Because of beauty is in me.
752,REVERIE,And then I know that every mind
753,REVERIE,Among the millions of my kind
754,REVERIE,Makes earth his own particular
755,REVERIE,"And privately created star,"
756,REVERIE,"That earth has thus no single state,"
757,REVERIE,Being every man articulate.
758,REVERIE,Till thought has no horizon then
759,REVERIE,I try to think how many men
760,REVERIE,There are to make an earth apart
761,REVERIE,"In symbol of the urgent heart,"
762,REVERIE,"For there are forty in my street,"
763,REVERIE,"And seven hundred more in Greet,"
764,REVERIE,"And families at Luton Hoo,"
765,REVERIE,"And there are men in China, too."
766,REVERIE,
767,REVERIE,And what immensity is this
768,REVERIE,That is but a parenthesis
769,REVERIE,"Set in a little human thought,"
770,REVERIE,Before the body comes to naught.
771,REVERIE,There at the bottom of the copse
772,REVERIE,"I see a field of turnip tops,"
773,REVERIE,I see the cropping cattle pass
774,REVERIE,"There in another field, of grass."
775,REVERIE,"And fields and fields, with seven towns,"
776,REVERIE,"A river, and a flight of downs,"
777,REVERIE,"Steeples for all religious men,"
778,REVERIE,"Ten thousand trees, and orchards ten,"
779,REVERIE,A mighty span that curves away
780,REVERIE,"Into blue beauty, and I lay"
781,REVERIE,All this as quartered on a sphere
782,REVERIE,"Hung huge in space, a thing of fear"
783,REVERIE,Vast as the circle of the sky
784,REVERIE,Completed to the astonished eye;
785,REVERIE,"And then I think that all I see,"
786,REVERIE,Whereof I frame immensity
787,REVERIE,"Globed for amazement, is no more"
788,REVERIE,"Than a shire’s corner, and that four"
789,REVERIE,Great shires being ten times multiplied
790,REVERIE,Are small on the Atlantic tide
791,REVERIE,As an emerald on a silver bowl ...
792,REVERIE,And the Atlantic to the whole
793,REVERIE,Sweep of this tributary star
794,REVERIE,That is our earth is but ... and far
795,REVERIE,Through dreadful space the outmeasured mind
796,REVERIE,Seeks to conceive the unconfined.
797,REVERIE,
798,REVERIE,"I think of Time. How, when his wing"
799,REVERIE,Composes all our quarrelling
800,REVERIE,In some green corner where May leaves
801,REVERIE,"Are loud with blackbirds on all eves,"
802,REVERIE,And all the dust that was our bones
803,REVERIE,"Is underneath memorial stones,"
804,REVERIE,"Then shall old jealousies, while we"
805,REVERIE,"Lie side by side most quietly,"
806,REVERIE,"Be but oblivion’s fools, and still"
807,REVERIE,When curious pilgrims ask--“What skill
808,REVERIE,Had these that from oblivion saves?”--
809,REVERIE,My song shall sing above our graves.
810,REVERIE,
811,REVERIE,"I think how men of gentle mind,"
812,REVERIE,"And friendly will, and honest kind,"
813,REVERIE,Deny their nature and appear
814,REVERIE,Fellows of jealousy and fear;
815,REVERIE,"Having single faith, and natural wit"
816,REVERIE,"To measure truth and cherish it,"
817,REVERIE,"Yet, strangely, when they build in thought,"
818,REVERIE,Twisting the honesty that wrought
819,REVERIE,"In the straight motion of the heart,"
820,REVERIE,Into its feigning counterpart
821,REVERIE,That is the brain’s betrayal of
822,REVERIE,The simple purposes of love;
823,REVERIE,And what yet sorrier decline
824,REVERIE,"Is theirs when, eager to confine"
825,REVERIE,No more within the silent brain
826,REVERIE,"Its habit, thought seeks birth again"
827,REVERIE,"In speech, as honesty has done"
828,REVERIE,In thought; then even what had won
829,REVERIE,From heart to brain fades and is lost
830,REVERIE,"In this pretended pentecost,"
831,REVERIE,This their forlorn captivity
832,REVERIE,"To speech, who have not learnt to be"
833,REVERIE,"Lords of the word, nor kept among"
834,REVERIE,The sterner climates of the tongue ...
835,REVERIE,"So truth is in their hearts, and then"
836,REVERIE,"Falls to confusion in the brain,"
837,REVERIE,"And, fading through this mid-eclipse,"
838,REVERIE,It perishes upon the lips.
839,REVERIE,
840,REVERIE,I think how year by year I still
841,REVERIE,Find working in my dauntless will
842,REVERIE,Sudden timidities that are
843,REVERIE,Merely the echo of some far
844,REVERIE,Forgotten tyrannies that came
845,REVERIE,To youth’s bewilderment and shame;
846,REVERIE,"That yet a magisterial gown,"
847,REVERIE,Being worn by one of no renown
848,REVERIE,And half a generation less
849,REVERIE,"In years than I, can dispossess"
850,REVERIE,Something my circumspecter mood
851,REVERIE,"Of excellence and quietude,"
852,REVERIE,And if a Bishop speaks to me
853,REVERIE,I tremble with propriety.
854,REVERIE,
855,REVERIE,I think how strange it is that he
856,REVERIE,Who goes most comradely with me
857,REVERIE,"In beauty’s worship, takes delight"
858,REVERIE,In shows that to my eager sight
859,REVERIE,"Are shadows and unmanifest,"
860,REVERIE,While beauty’s favour and behest
861,REVERIE,To me in motion are revealed
862,REVERIE,That is against his vision sealed;
863,REVERIE,Yet is our hearts’ necessity
864,REVERIE,"Not twofold, but a common plea"
865,REVERIE,"That chaos come to continence,"
866,REVERIE,Whereto the arch-intelligence
867,REVERIE,Richly in divers voices makes
868,REVERIE,Its answer for our several sakes.
869,REVERIE,
870,REVERIE,I see the disinherited
871,REVERIE,"And long procession of the dead,"
872,REVERIE,Who have in generations gone
873,REVERIE,Held fugitive dominion
874,REVERIE,Of this same primrose pasturage
875,REVERIE,That is my momentary wage.
876,REVERIE,I see two lovers move along
877,REVERIE,"These shadowed silences of song,"
878,REVERIE,With spring in blossom at their feet
879,REVERIE,More incommunicably sweet
880,REVERIE,"To their hearts’ more magnificence,"
881,REVERIE,"Than to the common courts of sense,"
882,REVERIE,Till joy his tardy closure tells
883,REVERIE,With coming of the curfew bells.
884,REVERIE,I see the knights of spur and sword
885,REVERIE,"Crossing the little woodland ford,"
886,REVERIE,Riding in ghostly cavalcade
887,REVERIE,On some unchronicled crusade.
888,REVERIE,I see the silent hunter go
889,REVERIE,"In cloth of yeoman green, with bow"
890,REVERIE,"Strung, and a quiver of grey wings."
891,REVERIE,I see the little herd who brings
892,REVERIE,"His cattle homeward, while his sire"
893,REVERIE,Makes bivouac in Warwickshire
894,REVERIE,"This night, the liege and loyal man"
895,REVERIE,Of Cavalier or Puritan.
896,REVERIE,"And as they pass, the nameless dead,"
897,REVERIE,"Unsung, uncelebrate, and sped"
898,REVERIE,Upon an unremembered hour
899,REVERIE,"As any twelvemonth fallen flower,"
900,REVERIE,I think how strangely yet they live
901,REVERIE,For all their days were fugitive.
902,REVERIE,
903,REVERIE,I think how soon we too shall be
904,REVERIE,A story with our ancestry.
905,REVERIE,
906,REVERIE,I think what miracle has been
907,REVERIE,That you whose love among this green
908,REVERIE,Delightful solitude is still
909,REVERIE,"The stay and substance of my will,"
910,REVERIE,"The dear custodian of my song,"
911,REVERIE,"My thrifty counsellor and strong,"
912,REVERIE,Should take the time of all time’s tide
913,REVERIE,"That was my season, to abide"
914,REVERIE,On earth also; that we should be
915,REVERIE,Charted across eternity
916,REVERIE,To one elect and happy day
917,REVERIE,Of yellow primroses in May.
918,REVERIE,
919,REVERIE,"The clock is calling five o’clock,"
920,REVERIE,And Nonesopretty brings her flock
921,REVERIE,"To fold, and Tom comes back from town"
922,REVERIE,"With hose and ribbons worth a crown,"
923,REVERIE,And duly at The Old King’s Head
924,REVERIE,"They gather now to daily bread,"
925,REVERIE,And I no more may meditate

1355,THE BUILDING,A step goes out into the silence; far

1386,THE BUILDING,"And whence all these? The hod and plummet-line,"

1400,THE BUILDING,Of man’s most urgent meditation stayed
1401,THE BUILDING,Even as his first thought--“Whence am I sprung?”

1403,THE BUILDING,"In that first act for man’s astonishment,"
1404,THE BUILDING,"From age to unconfessing age, among"
1405,THE BUILDING,His manifold travel. And in all I see

1408,THE BUILDING,Of chaos bidden into many-hued
1409,THE BUILDING,"Wonders of form, life in the void create,"
1410,THE BUILDING,And monstrous silence made articulate.
1411,THE BUILDING,
1412,THE BUILDING,Not the first word of God upon the deep

1414,THE BUILDING,More marvellous than these new walls that sweep
1415,THE BUILDING,"Starward, these lines that discipline the clay,"
1416,THE BUILDING,These lamps swung in the wind that send their light
1417,THE BUILDING,On swart men climbing ladders in the night.
1418,THE BUILDING,No trowel-tap but sings anew for men

1465,I,"Exulting not for perils dared, downcast"
1466,I,And weary-eyed and desolate for shame
1467,I,Of having been unstirred of all the sound
1468,I,Of the deep music of the men that move
1469,I,Through the world’s days in suffering and love.
1470,I,
1471,I,Poor barren years that brooded over-much
1472,I,"On your own burden, pale and stricken years--"
1473,I,"Go down to your oblivion, we part"
1474,I,With no reproach or ceremonial tears.
1475,I,Henceforth my hands are lifted to the touch
1476,I,"Of hands that labour with me, and my heart"
1477,I,Hereafter to the world’s heart shall be set
1478,I,And its own pain forget.
1479,I,Time gathers to my name--
1480,I,"Days dead are dark; the days to be, a flame"
1481,I,"Of wonder and of promise, and great cries"
1482,I,Of travelling people reach me--I must rise.
1483,I,
1484,I,
1485,II,II
1486,II,
1487,II,Was I not man? Could I not rise alone
1488,II,"Above the shifting of the things that be,"
1489,II,Rise to the crest of all the stars and see
1490,II,The ways of all the world as from a throne?
1491,II,"Was I not man, with proud imperial will"
1492,II,To cancel all the secrets of high heaven?
1493,II,Should not my sole unbridled purpose fill
1494,II,All hidden paths with light when once was riven
1495,II,God’s veil by my indomitable will?
1496,II,
1497,II,"So dreamt I, little man of little vision,"
1498,II,Great only in unconsecrated pride;
1499,II,"Man’s pity grew from pity to derision,"
1500,II,"And still I thought, “Albeit they deride,"
1501,II,Yet is it mine uncharted ways to dare
1502,II,"Unknown to these,"
1503,II,"And they shall stumble darkly, unaware"
1504,II,Of solemn mysteries
1505,II,Whereof the key is mine alone to bear.”
1506,II,
1507,II,"So I forgot my God, and I forgot"
1508,II,"The holy sweet communion of men,"
1509,II,"And moved in desolate places, where are not"
1510,II,Meek hands held out with patient healing when
1511,II,The hours are heavy with uncharitable pain;
1512,II,No company but vain
1513,II,And arrogant thoughts were with me at my side.
1514,II,And ever to myself I lied.
1515,II,Saying “Apart from all men thus I go
1516,II,To know the things that they may never know.”
1517,II,
1518,II,
1519,III,III
1520,III,
1521,III,Then a great change befell;
1522,III,Long time I stood
1523,III,In witless hardihood
1524,III,With eyes on one sole changeless vision set--
1525,III,The deep disturbèd fret
1526,III,Of men who made brief tarrying in hell
1527,III,On their earth travelling.
1528,III,It was as though the lives of men should be
1529,III,"See circle-wise, whereof one little span"
1530,III,Through which all passed was blackened with the wing
1531,III,"Of perilous evil, bateless misery."
1532,III,"But all beyond, making the whole complete"
1533,III,O’er which the travelling feet
1534,III,Of every man
1535,III,"Made way or ever he might come to death,"
1536,III,Was odorous with the breath
1537,III,"Of honey-laden flowers, and alive"
1538,III,With sacrificial ministrations sweet
1539,III,"Of man to man, and swift and holy loves,"
1540,III,"And large heroic hopes, whereby should thrive"
1541,III,Man’s spirit as he moves
1542,III,From dawn of life to the great dawn of death.
1543,III,
1544,III,It was as though mine eyes were set alone
1545,III,"Upon that woeful passage of despair,"
1546,III,Until I held that life had never known
1547,III,Dominion but in this most troubled place
1548,III,Where many a ruined grace
1549,III,And many a friendless care
1550,III,Ran to and fro in sorrowful unrest.
1551,III,Still in my hand I pressed
1552,III,"Hope’s fragile chalice, whence I drew deep draughts"
1553,III,That heartened me that even yet should grow
1554,III,"Out of this dread confusion, as of broken crafts"
1555,III,"Driven along ungovernable seas,"
1556,III,"Prosperous order, and that I should know"
1557,III,After long vigil all the mysteries
1558,III,Of human wonder and of human fate.
1559,III,
1560,III,"O fool, O only great"
1561,III,"In pride unhallowed, O most blind of heart!"
1562,III,"Confusion but more dark confusion bred,"
1563,III,"Grief nurtured grief, I cried aloud and said,"
1564,III,"“Through trackless ways the soul of man is hurled,"
1565,III,"No sign upon the forehead of the skies,"
1566,III,"No beacon, and no chart"
1567,III,"Are given to him, and the inscrutable world"
1568,III,But mocks his scars and fills his mouth with dust.”
1569,III,
1570,III,_And lies bore lies_
1571,III,"_And lust bore lust,_"
1572,III,"_And the world was heavy with flowerless rods,_"
1573,III,_And pride outran_
1574,III,_The strength of a man_
1575,III,_Who had set himself in the place of gods._
1576,III,
1577,III,
1578,IV,IV
1579,IV,
1580,IV,Soon was I then to gather bitter shame
1581,IV,Of spirit; I had been most wildly proud--
1582,IV,Yet in my pride had been
1583,IV,"Some little courage, formless as a cloud,"
1584,IV,"Unpiloted save by a vagrant wind,"
1585,IV,But still an earnest of the bonds that tame
1586,IV,"The legionary hates, of sacred loves that lean"
1587,IV,From the high soul of man towards his kind.
1588,IV,And all my grief
1589,IV,Had been for those I watched go to and fro
1590,IV,In uncompassioned woe
1591,IV,Along that little span my unbelief
1592,IV,Had fashioned in my vision as all life.
1593,IV,"Now even this so little virtue waned,"
1594,IV,For I became caught up into the strife
1595,IV,"That I had pitied, and my soul was stained"
1596,IV,"At last by that most venomous despair,"
1597,IV,Self-pity.
1598,IV,I no longer was aware
1599,IV,"Of any will to heal the world’s unrest,"
1600,IV,"I suffered as it suffered, and I grew"
1601,IV,"Troubled in all my daily trafficking,"
1602,IV,Not with the large heroic trouble known
1603,IV,By proud adventurous men who would atone
1604,IV,With their own passionate pity for the sting
1605,IV,"And anguish of a world of peril and snares,"
1606,IV,It was the trouble of a soul in thrall
1607,IV,"To mean despairs,"
1608,IV,Driven about a waste where neither fall
1609,IV,"Of words from lips of love, nor consolation"
1610,IV,"Of grave eyes comforting, nor ministration"
1611,IV,Of hand or heart could pierce the deadly wall

2070,IN LADY STREET,"He lives in Lady Street; a bed,"

2072,IN LADY STREET,
2073,IN LADY STREET,But all day long
2074,IN LADY STREET,A time is singing in his head
2075,IN LADY STREET,Of youth in Gloucester lanes. He hears
2076,IN LADY STREET,"The wind among the barley-blades,"
2077,IN LADY STREET,The tapping of the woodpeckers
2078,IN LADY STREET,"On the smooth beeches, thistle-spades"
2079,IN LADY STREET,Slicing the sinewy roots; he sees

2100,IN LADY STREET,More rich than are the neck-feathers;

2120,IN LADY STREET,Of many-coloured merchandise
2121,IN LADY STREET,"He makes a shining paradise,"
2122,IN LADY STREET,As all day long chrysanthemums
2123,IN LADY STREET,"He sells, and red and yellow plums"
2124,IN LADY STREET,And cauliflowers. In that one spot
2125,IN LADY STREET,Of Lady Street the sun is not

2247,THE CARVER IN STONE,Might threaten from your heart. Grey eyes he had
2248,THE CARVER IN STONE,Under a brow was drawn because he knew
2249,THE CARVER IN STONE,So many seasons to so many pass
2250,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of upright service, loyal, unabased"
2251,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Before the world seducing, and so, barren"
2252,THE CARVER IN STONE,Of good words praising and thought that mated his.
2253,THE CARVER IN STONE,He carved in stone. Out of his quiet life
2254,THE CARVER IN STONE,He watched as any faithful seaman charged
2255,THE CARVER IN STONE,"With tidings of the myriad faring sea,"
2256,THE CARVER IN STONE,And thoughts and premonitions through his mind

2258,THE CARVER IN STONE,"His hungry spirit held, till all they were"

2262,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Over his brain, he would triumph into the light"
2263,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of one clear mood, unblemished of the blind"
2264,THE CARVER IN STONE,Legions of errant thought that cried about
2265,THE CARVER IN STONE,"His rapt seclusion: as a pearl unsoiled,"
2266,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Nay, rather washed to lonelier chastity,"
2267,THE CARVER IN STONE,"In gritty mud. And then would come a bird,"

2269,THE CARVER IN STONE,"A beast at pasture, or a clustered fruit,"
2270,THE CARVER IN STONE,"A peasant face as were the saints of old,"

2272,THE CARVER IN STONE,Swung in miraculous poise--some stray from the world
2273,THE CARVER IN STONE,Of things created by the eternal mind
2274,THE CARVER IN STONE,In joy articulate. And his perfect mood
2275,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Would dwell about the token of God’s mood,"
2276,THE CARVER IN STONE,Until in bird or flower or moving wind
2277,THE CARVER IN STONE,Or flock or shepherd or the troops of heaven
2278,THE CARVER IN STONE,It sprang in one fierce moment of desire
2279,THE CARVER IN STONE,To visible form.
2280,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Then would his chisel work among the stone,"

2282,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Or starry curve, till risen anew there sang"
2283,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Shape out of chaos, and again the vision"
2284,THE CARVER IN STONE,Of one mind single from the world was pressed
2285,THE CARVER IN STONE,Upon the daily custom of the sky
2286,THE CARVER IN STONE,Or field or the body of man.
2287,THE CARVER IN STONE,
2288,THE CARVER IN STONE,His people
2289,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Had many gods for worship. The tiger-god,"
2290,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The owl, the dewlapped bull, the running pard,"
2291,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The camel and the lizard of the slime,"
2292,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The ram with quivering fleece and fluted horn,"
2293,THE CARVER IN STONE,The crested eagle and the doming bat
2294,THE CARVER IN STONE,Were sacred. And the king and his high priests
2295,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Decreed a temple, wide on columns huge,"
2296,THE CARVER IN STONE,Should top the cornlands to the sky’s far line.
2297,THE CARVER IN STONE,They bade the carvers carve along the walls
2298,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Images of their gods, each one to carve"
2299,THE CARVER IN STONE,"As he desired, his choice to name his god...."
2300,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And many came; and he among them, glad"
2301,THE CARVER IN STONE,Of three leagues’ travel through the singing air
2302,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of dawn among the boughs yet bare of green,"
2303,THE CARVER IN STONE,The eager flight of the spring leading his blood
2304,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Into swift lofty channels of the air,"
2305,THE CARVER IN STONE,Proud as an eagle riding to the sun....
2306,THE CARVER IN STONE,"An eagle, clean of pinion--there’s his choice."
2307,THE CARVER IN STONE,
2308,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Daylong they worked under the growing roof,"
2309,THE CARVER IN STONE,"One at his leopard, one the staring ram,"
2310,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And he winning his eagle from the stone,"
2311,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Until each man had carved one image out,"
2312,THE CARVER IN STONE,Arow beyond the portal of the house.
2313,THE CARVER IN STONE,"They stood arow, the company of gods,"
2314,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Camel and bat, lizard and bull and ram,"
2315,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The pard and owl, dead figures on the wall,"
2316,THE CARVER IN STONE,Figures of habit driven on the stone
2317,THE CARVER IN STONE,By chisels governed by no heat of the brain
2318,THE CARVER IN STONE,But drudges of hands that moved by easy rule.
2319,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Proudly recorded mood was none, no thought"
2320,THE CARVER IN STONE,Plucked from the dark battalions of the mind
2321,THE CARVER IN STONE,And throned in everlasting sight. But one
2322,THE CARVER IN STONE,God of them all was witness of belief
2323,THE CARVER IN STONE,And large adventure dared. His eagle spread
2324,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Wide pinions on a cloudless ground of heaven,"
2325,THE CARVER IN STONE,Glad with the heart’s high courage of that dawn
2326,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Moving upon the ploughlands newly sown,"
2327,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Dead stone the rest. He looked, and knew it so."
2328,THE CARVER IN STONE,
2329,THE CARVER IN STONE,Then came the king with priests and counsellors
2330,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And many chosen of the people, wise"
2331,THE CARVER IN STONE,"With words weary of custom, and eyes askew"
2332,THE CARVER IN STONE,That watched their neighbour face for any news
2333,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of the best way of judgment, till, each sure"
2334,THE CARVER IN STONE,"None would determine with authority,"
2335,THE CARVER IN STONE,All spoke in prudent praise. One liked the owl
2336,THE CARVER IN STONE,Because an owl blinked on the beam of his barn.
2337,THE CARVER IN STONE,"One, hoarse with crying gospels in the street,"
2338,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Praised most the ram, because the common folk"
2339,THE CARVER IN STONE,Wore breeches made of ram’s wool. One declared
2340,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The tiger pleased him best,--the man who carved"
2341,THE CARVER IN STONE,The tiger-god was halt out of the womb--
2342,THE CARVER IN STONE,"A man to praise, being so pitiful."
2343,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And one, whose eyes dwelt in a distant void,"
2344,THE CARVER IN STONE,"With spell and omen pat upon his lips,"
2345,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And a purse for any crystal prophet ripe,"
2346,THE CARVER IN STONE,"A zealot of the mist, gazed at the bull--"
2347,THE CARVER IN STONE,A lean ill-shapen bull of meagre lines
2348,THE CARVER IN STONE,That scarce the steel had graved upon the stone--
2349,THE CARVER IN STONE,Saying that here was very mystery
2350,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And truth, did men but know. And one there was"
2351,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Who praised his eagle, but remembering"
2352,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The lither pinion of the swift, the curve"
2353,THE CARVER IN STONE,That liked him better of the mirrored swan.
2354,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And they who carved the tiger-god and ram,"
2355,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The camel and the pard, the owl and bull,"
2356,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And lizard, listened greedily, and made"
2357,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Humble denial of their worthiness,"
2358,THE CARVER IN STONE,And when the king his royal judgment gave
2359,THE CARVER IN STONE,"That all had fashioned well, and bade that each"
2360,THE CARVER IN STONE,Re-shape his chosen god along the walls
2361,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Till all the temple boasted of their skill,"
2362,THE CARVER IN STONE,They bowed themselves in token that as this
2363,THE CARVER IN STONE,Never had carvers been so fortunate.
2364,THE CARVER IN STONE,
2365,THE CARVER IN STONE,Only the man with wide and patient eyes
2366,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Made no denial, neither bowed his head."
2367,THE CARVER IN STONE,Already while they spoke his thought had gone
2368,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Far from his eagle, leaving it for a sign"
2369,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Loyally wrought of one deep breath of life,"
2370,THE CARVER IN STONE,And played about the image of a toad
2371,THE CARVER IN STONE,That crawled among his ivy leaves. A queer
2372,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Puff-bellied toad, with eyes that always stared"
2373,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Sidelong at heaven and saw no heaven there,"
2374,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Weak-hammed, and with a throttle somehow twisted"
2375,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Beyond full wholesome draughts of air, and skin"
2376,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of wrinkled lips, the only zest or will"
2377,THE CARVER IN STONE,The little flashing tongue searching the leaves.
2378,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And king and priest, chosen and counsellor,"
2379,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Babbling out of their thin and jealous brains,"
2380,THE CARVER IN STONE,Seemed strangely one; a queer enormous toad
2381,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Panting under giant leaves of dark,"
2382,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Sunk in the loins, peering into the day."
2383,THE CARVER IN STONE,Their judgment wry he counted not for wrong
2384,THE CARVER IN STONE,More than the fabled poison of the toad
2385,THE CARVER IN STONE,Striking at simple wits; how should their thought
2386,THE CARVER IN STONE,Or word in praise or blame come near the peace
2387,THE CARVER IN STONE,That shone in seasonable hours above
2388,THE CARVER IN STONE,The patience of his spirit’s husbandry?
2389,THE CARVER IN STONE,"They foolish and not seeing, how should he"
2390,THE CARVER IN STONE,Spend anger there or fear--great ceremonies
2391,THE CARVER IN STONE,Equal for none save great antagonists?
2392,THE CARVER IN STONE,The grave indifference of his heart before them
2393,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Was moved by laughter innocent of hate,"
2394,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Chastising clean of spite, that moulded them"
2395,THE CARVER IN STONE,Into the antic likeness of his toad
2396,THE CARVER IN STONE,Bidding for laughter underneath the leaves.
2397,THE CARVER IN STONE,
2398,THE CARVER IN STONE,"He bowed not, nor disputed, but he saw"
2399,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Those ill-created joyless gods, and loathed,"
2400,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And saw them creeping, creeping round the walls,"
2401,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Death breeding death, wile witnessing to wile,"
2402,THE CARVER IN STONE,And sickened at the dull iniquity
2403,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Should be rewarded, and for ever breathe"
2404,THE CARVER IN STONE,Contagion on the folk gathered in prayer.
2405,THE CARVER IN STONE,His truth should not be doomed to march among
2406,THE CARVER IN STONE,"This falsehood to the ages. He was called,"
2407,THE CARVER IN STONE,And he must labour there; if so the king
2408,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Would grant it, where the pillars bore the roof"
2409,THE CARVER IN STONE,A galleried way of meditation nursed
2410,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Secluded time, with wall of ready stone"
2411,THE CARVER IN STONE,In panels for the carver set between
2412,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The windows--there his chisel should be set,--"
2413,THE CARVER IN STONE,"It was his plea. And the king spoke of him,"
2414,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Scorning, as one lack-fettle, among all these"
2415,THE CARVER IN STONE,Eager to take the riches of renown;
2416,THE CARVER IN STONE,One fearful of the light or knowing nothing
2417,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of light’s dimension, a witling who would throw"
2418,THE CARVER IN STONE,Honour aside and praise spoken aloud
2419,THE CARVER IN STONE,All men of heart should covet. Let him go
2420,THE CARVER IN STONE,Grubbing out of the sight of these who knew
2421,THE CARVER IN STONE,The worth of substance; there was his proper trade.
2422,THE CARVER IN STONE,
2423,THE CARVER IN STONE,"A squat and curious toad indeed.... The eyes,"
2424,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Patient and grey, were dumb as were the lips,"
2425,THE CARVER IN STONE,"That, fixed and governed, hoarded from them all"
2426,THE CARVER IN STONE,The larger laughter lifting in his heart.
2427,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Straightway about his gallery he moved,"
2428,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Measured the windows and the virgin stone,"
2429,THE CARVER IN STONE,Till all was weighed and patterned in his brain.
2430,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Then first where most the shadow struck the wall,"
2431,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Under the sills, and centre of the base,"
2432,THE CARVER IN STONE,From floor to sill out of the stone was wooed
2433,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Memorial folly, as from the chisel leapt"
2434,THE CARVER IN STONE,His chastening laughter searching priest and king--
2435,THE CARVER IN STONE,"A huge and wrinkled toad, with legs asplay,"
2436,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And belly loaded, leering with great eyes"
2437,THE CARVER IN STONE,Busily fixed upon the void.
2438,THE CARVER IN STONE,All days
2439,THE CARVER IN STONE,His chisel was the first to ring across
2440,THE CARVER IN STONE,The temple’s quiet; and at fall of dusk
2441,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Passing among the carvers homeward, they"
2442,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Would speak of him as mad, or weak against"
2443,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The challenge of the world, and let him go"
2444,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Lonely, as was his will, under the night"
2445,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of stars or cloud or summer’s folded sun,"
2446,THE CARVER IN STONE,Through crop and wood and pastureland to sleep.
2447,THE CARVER IN STONE,None took the narrow stair as wondering
2448,THE CARVER IN STONE,"How did his chisel prosper in the stone,"
2449,THE CARVER IN STONE,Unvisited his labour and forgot.
2450,THE CARVER IN STONE,And times when he would lean out of his height
2451,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And watch the gods growing along the walls,"
2452,THE CARVER IN STONE,The row of carvers in their linen coats
2453,THE CARVER IN STONE,Took in his vision a virtue that alone
2454,THE CARVER IN STONE,Carving they had not nor the thing they carved.
2455,THE CARVER IN STONE,Knowing the health that flowed about his close
2456,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Imagining, the daily quiet won"
2457,THE CARVER IN STONE,"From process of his clean and supple craft,"
2458,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Those carvers there, far on the floor below,"
2459,THE CARVER IN STONE,Would haply be transfigured in his thought
2460,THE CARVER IN STONE,Into a gallant company of men
2461,THE CARVER IN STONE,Glad of the strict and loyal reckoning
2462,THE CARVER IN STONE,That proved in the just presence of the brain
2463,THE CARVER IN STONE,Each chisel-stroke. How surely would he prosper
2464,THE CARVER IN STONE,In pleasant talk at easy hours with men
2465,THE CARVER IN STONE,So fashioned if it might be--and his eyes
2466,THE CARVER IN STONE,Would pass again to those dead gods that grew
2467,THE CARVER IN STONE,In spreading evil round the temple walls;
2468,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And, one dead pressure made, the carvers moved"
2469,THE CARVER IN STONE,Along the wall to mould and mould again
2470,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The self-same god, their chisels on the stone"
2471,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Tapping in dull precision as before,"
2472,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And he would turn, back to his lonely truth."
2473,THE CARVER IN STONE,
2474,THE CARVER IN STONE,"He carved apace. And first his people’s gods,"
2475,THE CARVER IN STONE,"About the toad, out of their sterile time,"
2476,THE CARVER IN STONE,Under his hand thrilled and were recreate.
2477,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The bull, the pard, the camel and the ram,"
2478,THE CARVER IN STONE,Tiger and owl and bat--all were the signs
2479,THE CARVER IN STONE,Visibly made body on the stone
2480,THE CARVER IN STONE,Of sightless thought adventuring the host
2481,THE CARVER IN STONE,That is mere spirit; these the bloom achieved
2482,THE CARVER IN STONE,By secret labour in the flowing wood
2483,THE CARVER IN STONE,Of rain and air and wind and continent sun....
2484,THE CARVER IN STONE,"His tiger, lithe, immobile in the stone,"
2485,THE CARVER IN STONE,"A swift destruction for a moment leashed,"
2486,THE CARVER IN STONE,Sprang crying from the jealous stealth of men
2487,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Opposed in cunning watch, with engines hid"
2488,THE CARVER IN STONE,Of torment and calamitous desire.
2489,THE CARVER IN STONE,"His leopard, swift on lean and paltry limbs,"
2490,THE CARVER IN STONE,Was fear in flight before accusing faith.
2491,THE CARVER IN STONE,"His bull, with eyes that often in the dusk"
2492,THE CARVER IN STONE,Would lift from the sweet meadow grass to watch
2493,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Him homeward passing, bore on massy beam"
2494,THE CARVER IN STONE,The burden of the patient of the earth.
2495,THE CARVER IN STONE,"His camel bore the burden of the damned,"
2496,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Being gaunt, with eyes aslant along the nose."
2497,THE CARVER IN STONE,"He had a friend, who hammered bronze and iron"
2498,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And cupped the moonstone on a silver ring,"
2499,THE CARVER IN STONE,"One constant like himself, would come at night"
2500,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Or bid him as a guest, when they would make"
2501,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Their poets touch a starrier height, or search"
2502,THE CARVER IN STONE,Together with unparsimonious mind
2503,THE CARVER IN STONE,The crowded harbours of mortality.
2504,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And there were jests, wholesome as harvest ale"
2505,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of homely habit, bred of hearts that dared"
2506,THE CARVER IN STONE,Judgment of laughter under the eternal eye:
2507,THE CARVER IN STONE,This frolic wisdom was his carven owl.
2508,THE CARVER IN STONE,"His ram was lordship on the lonely hills,"
2509,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Alert and fleet, content only to know"
2510,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The wind mightily pouring on his fleece,"
2511,THE CARVER IN STONE,With yesterday and all unrisen suns
2512,THE CARVER IN STONE,Poorer than disinherited ghosts. His bat
2513,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Was ancient envy made a mockery,"
2514,THE CARVER IN STONE,Cowering below the newer eagle carved
2515,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Above the arches with wide pinion spread,"
2516,THE CARVER IN STONE,His faith’s dominion of that happy dawn.
2517,THE CARVER IN STONE,
2518,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And so he wrought the gods upon the wall,"
2519,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Living and crying out of his desire,"
2520,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Out of his patient incorruptible thought,"
2521,THE CARVER IN STONE,Wrought them in joy was wages to his faith.
2522,THE CARVER IN STONE,And other than the gods he made. The stalks
2523,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of bluebells heavy with the news of spring,"
2524,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The vine loaded with plenty of the year,"
2525,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And swallows, merely tenderness of thought"
2526,THE CARVER IN STONE,Bidding the stone to small and fragile flight;
2527,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Leaves, the thin relics of autumnal boughs,"
2528,THE CARVER IN STONE,Or massed in June....
2529,THE CARVER IN STONE,All from their native pressure bloomed and sprang
2530,THE CARVER IN STONE,Under his shaping hand into a proud
2531,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And governed image of the central man,--"
2532,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Their moulding, charts of all his travelling."
2533,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And all were deftly ordered, duly set"
2534,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Between the windows, underneath the sills,"
2535,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And roofward, as a motion rightly planned,"
2536,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Till on the wall, out of the sullen stone,"
2537,THE CARVER IN STONE,"A glory blazed, his vision manifest,"
2538,THE CARVER IN STONE,His wonder captive. And he was content.
2539,THE CARVER IN STONE,
2540,THE CARVER IN STONE,And when the builders and the carvers knew
2541,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Their labour done, and high the temple stood"
2542,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Over the cornlands, king and counsellor"
2543,THE CARVER IN STONE,And priest and chosen of the people came
2544,THE CARVER IN STONE,Among a ceremonial multitude
2545,THE CARVER IN STONE,"To dedication. And, below the thrones"
2546,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Where king and archpriest ruled above the throng,"
2547,THE CARVER IN STONE,Highest among the ranked artificers
2548,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The carvers stood. And when, the temple vowed"
2549,THE CARVER IN STONE,"To holy use, tribute and choral praise"
2550,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Given as was ordained, the king looked down"
2551,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Upon the gathered folk, and bade them see"
2552,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The comely gods fashioned about the walls,"
2553,THE CARVER IN STONE,And keep in honour men whose precious skill
2554,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Could so adorn the sessions of their worship,"
2555,THE CARVER IN STONE,Gravely the carvers bowed them to the ground.
2556,THE CARVER IN STONE,Only the man with wide and patient eyes
2557,THE CARVER IN STONE,Stood not among them; nor did any come
2558,THE CARVER IN STONE,"To count his labour, where he watched alone"
2559,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Above the coloured throng. He heard, and looked"
2560,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Again upon his work, and knew it good,"
2561,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Smiled on his toad, passed down the stair unseen"
2562,THE CARVER IN STONE,And sang across the teeming meadows home.

2634,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,There is an old woman who looks each night
2635,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,Out of the wood.
2636,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"She has one tooth, that isn’t too white."
2637,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,She isn’t too good.
2638,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,
2639,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"She came from the north looking for me,"
2640,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,About my jewel.
2641,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"Her son, she says, is tall as can be;"
2642,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"But, men say, cruel."
2643,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,
2644,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"My girl went northward, holiday making,"
2645,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,And a queer man spoke
2646,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"At the woodside once when night was breaking,"
2647,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,And her heart broke.
2648,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,
2649,A MAN’S DAUGHTER,"For ever since she has pined and pined,"

5378,MOONRISE,So sing we loud--
5379,MOONRISE,
5380,MOONRISE,"“Out beyond the dust lies mystery of moonrise,"
5381,MOONRISE,"We go to chiller learning than is bred in the sun,"
5382,MOONRISE,"Hectors, and riders, and a simple singer,"
5383,MOONRISE,Riding as one.”

5391,DEER,Shy in their herding dwell the fallow deer.
5392,DEER,They are spirits of wild sense. Nobody near
5393,DEER,"Comes upon their pastures. There a life they live,"
5394,DEER,"Of sufficient beauty, phantom, fugitive,"
5395,DEER,"Treading as in jungles free leopards do,"
5396,DEER,"Printless as evelight, instant as dew."
5397,DEER,"The great kine are patient, and home-coming sheep"
5398,DEER,Know our bidding. The fallow deer keep
5399,DEER,"Delicate and far their counsels wild,"
5400,DEER,Never to be folded reconciled
5401,DEER,To the spoiling hand as the poor flocks are:
5402,DEER,"Lightfoot, and swift, and unfamiliar,"
5403,DEER,"These you may not hinder, unconfined"
5404,DEER,Beautiful flocks of the mind.

5412,TO ONE I LOVE,"As I walked along the passage, in the night, beyond the stairs,"
5413,TO ONE I LOVE,"In the dark,"
5414,TO ONE I LOVE,"I was afraid,"
5415,TO ONE I LOVE,"Suddenly,"
5416,TO ONE I LOVE,"As will happen you know, my dear, it will often happen."
5417,TO ONE I LOVE,"I knew the walls at my side,"
5418,TO ONE I LOVE,"Knew the drawings hanging there, the order of their placing,"
5419,TO ONE I LOVE,"And the door where my bed lay beyond,"
5420,TO ONE I LOVE,And the window on the landing--
5421,TO ONE I LOVE,There was even a little ray of moonlight through it--
5422,TO ONE I LOVE,"All was known, familiar, my comfortable home;"
5423,TO ONE I LOVE,"And yet I was afraid,"
5424,TO ONE I LOVE,"Suddenly,"
5425,TO ONE I LOVE,"In the dark, like a child, of nothing,"
5426,TO ONE I LOVE,"Of vastness, of eternity, of the queer pains of thought,"
5427,TO ONE I LOVE,"Such as used to trouble me when I heard,"
5428,TO ONE I LOVE,"When I was little, the people talk"
5429,TO ONE I LOVE,"On Sundays of “As it was in the Beginning,"
5430,TO ONE I LOVE,"Is Now, and Ever Shall Be....”"
5431,TO ONE I LOVE,"I am thirty-six years old,"
5432,TO ONE I LOVE,"And folk are friendly to me,"
5433,TO ONE I LOVE,"And there are no ghosts that should have reason to haunt me,"
5434,TO ONE I LOVE,And I have tempted no magical happenings
5435,TO ONE I LOVE,By forsaking the clear noons of thought
5436,TO ONE I LOVE,For the wizardries that the credulous take
5437,TO ONE I LOVE,To be golden roads to revelation.
5438,TO ONE I LOVE,"I knew all was simplicity there,"
5439,TO ONE I LOVE,"Without conspiracy, without antagonism,"
5440,TO ONE I LOVE,"And yet I was afraid,"
5441,TO ONE I LOVE,"Suddenly,"
5442,TO ONE I LOVE,"A child, in the dark, forlorn...."
5443,TO ONE I LOVE,"And then, as suddenly,"
5444,TO ONE I LOVE,"I was aware of a profound, a miraculous understanding,"
5445,TO ONE I LOVE,Knowledge that comes to a man
5446,TO ONE I LOVE,"But once or twice, as a bird’s note"
5447,TO ONE I LOVE,In the still depth of the night
5448,TO ONE I LOVE,Striking upon the silence ...
5449,TO ONE I LOVE,"I stood at the door, and there"
5450,TO ONE I LOVE,"Was mellow candle-light,"
5451,TO ONE I LOVE,"And companionship, and comfort,"
5452,TO ONE I LOVE,And I knew
5453,TO ONE I LOVE,"That it was even so,"
5454,TO ONE I LOVE,That it must be even so
5455,TO ONE I LOVE,With death.
5456,TO ONE I LOVE,I knew
5457,TO ONE I LOVE,"That no harm could have touched me out of my fear,"
5458,TO ONE I LOVE,"Because I had no grudge against anything,"
5459,TO ONE I LOVE,Because I had desired
5460,TO ONE I LOVE,"In the darkness, when fear came,"
5461,TO ONE I LOVE,"Love only, and pity, and fellowship,"
5462,TO ONE I LOVE,"And it would have been a thing monstrous,"
5463,TO ONE I LOVE,Something defying nature
5464,TO ONE I LOVE,And all the simple universal fitness
5465,TO ONE I LOVE,For any force there to have come evilly
5466,TO ONE I LOVE,"Upon me, who had no evil in my heart,"
5467,TO ONE I LOVE,"But only trust, and tenderness"
5468,TO ONE I LOVE,"For every presence about me in the air,"
5469,TO ONE I LOVE,"For the very shadow about me,"
5470,TO ONE I LOVE,Being a little child for no one’s envy.
5471,TO ONE I LOVE,And I knew that God
5472,TO ONE I LOVE,Must understand that we go
5473,TO ONE I LOVE,"To death as little children,"
5474,TO ONE I LOVE,"Desiring love so simply, and love’s defence,"
5475,TO ONE I LOVE,"And that he would be a barren God, without humour,"
5476,TO ONE I LOVE,"To cheat so little, so wistful, a desire,"
5477,TO ONE I LOVE,That he created
5478,TO ONE I LOVE,"In us, in our childishness ..."
5479,TO ONE I LOVE,"And I may never again be sure of this,"
5480,TO ONE I LOVE,"But there, for a moment,"
5481,TO ONE I LOVE,"In the candle-light,"
5482,TO ONE I LOVE,"Standing at the door,"
5483,TO ONE I LOVE,I knew.

5502,TO ALICE MEYNELL,
5503,TO ALICE MEYNELL,"Yet thought has been, poor profligate,"

5509,TO ALICE MEYNELL,"And you upon your slender reed,"
5510,TO ALICE MEYNELL,"Most exquisitely tuned, have made"
5511,TO ALICE MEYNELL,For every singing heart a creed.
5512,TO ALICE MEYNELL,And I have heard; and I have played

5515,TO ALICE MEYNELL,"Knowing that still a friendly few,"
5516,TO ALICE MEYNELL,"Turning aside from turbulence,"
