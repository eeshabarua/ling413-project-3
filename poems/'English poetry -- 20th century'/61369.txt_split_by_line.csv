212,II.  MAXIXE,_Old Mexican Song._
213,II.  MAXIXE,
214,II.  MAXIXE,
215,II.  MAXIXE,The Mexican dwarfs can dance for miles
216,II.  MAXIXE,"Stamping their feet and scattering smiles,"
217,II.  MAXIXE,Till the loud hills laugh and laugh again
218,II.  MAXIXE,"At the dancing dwarfs in the golden plain,"
219,II.  MAXIXE,"Till the bamboos sing as the dwarfs dance by,"
220,II.  MAXIXE,"Kicking their feet at a jagged sky,"
221,II.  MAXIXE,That torn by leaves and gashed by hills
222,II.  MAXIXE,Rocks to the rhythm the hot sun shrills;
223,II.  MAXIXE,The bubble sun stretches shadows that pass
224,II.  MAXIXE,"To noiseless jumping-jacks of glass,"
225,II.  MAXIXE,"So long and thin, so silent and opaque,"
226,II.  MAXIXE,"That the lions shake their orange manes, and quake;"
227,II.  MAXIXE,And a shadow that leaps over Popacatapetl
228,II.  MAXIXE,Terrifies the tigers as they settle
229,II.  MAXIXE,"Cat-like limbs, cut with golden bars,"
230,II.  MAXIXE,Under bowers of flowers that shimmer like stars.
231,II.  MAXIXE,"Buzzing of insects flutters above,"
232,II.  MAXIXE,Shaking the rich trees' treasure-trove
233,II.  MAXIXE,"Till the fruit rushes down like a comet, whose tail"
234,II.  MAXIXE,"Thrashes the night with its golden flail,"
235,II.  MAXIXE,The fruit hisses down with a plump from its tree
236,II.  MAXIXE,Like the singing of a rainbow as it dips into the sea.
237,II.  MAXIXE,Loud red trumpets of great blossoms blare
238,II.  MAXIXE,"Triumphantly like heralds who blow a fanfare,"
239,II.  MAXIXE,"Till the humming-bird, bearing heaven on its wing,"
240,II.  MAXIXE,"Flies from the terrible blossoming,"
241,II.  MAXIXE,And the humble honey-bee is frightened by the fine
242,II.  MAXIXE,"Honey that is heavy like money and purple like wine,"
243,II.  MAXIXE,While birds that flaunt their pinions like pennons
244,II.  MAXIXE,"Shriek from their trees of oranges and lemons,"
245,II.  MAXIXE,"And the scent rises up in a cloud, to make"
246,II.  MAXIXE,"The hairy, swinging monkeys feel so weak"
247,II.  MAXIXE,That they each throw down a bitten coconut or mango.

250,II.  MAXIXE,
251,II.  MAXIXE,"Up flames a flamingo over the fandango,"
252,II.  MAXIXE,"Glowing like a fire, and gleaming like a ruby."
253,II.  MAXIXE,From Guadalajara to Guadalupe
254,II.  MAXIXE,It flies--in flying drops a feather
255,II.  MAXIXE,... And the snatching dwarfs stop dancing--and fight together.

263,I,
264,I,"From my high window,"
265,I,"From my high window in a southern city,"
266,I,"I peep through the slits of the shutters,"
267,I,Whose steps of light
268,I,Span darkness like a ladder.
269,I,Throwing wide the shutters
270,I,I let the streets into the silent room
271,I,With sudden clatter;
272,I,Walk out upon the balcony
273,I,Whose curving irons are bent
274,I,Like bows about to shoot--
275,I,Bows from which the mortal arrows
276,I,"Cast from dark eyes, dark-lashed"
277,I,"And shadowed by mantillas,"
278,I,Shall in the evening
279,I,Rain down upon men's hearts
280,I,"Paraded here, in southern climes,"
281,I,More openly.
282,I,"But, at this early moment of the day,"
283,I,The balconies are empty;
284,I,"Only the sun, still drowsy-fingered,"
285,I,"Plucks, pizzicato, at the rails,"
286,I,Draws out of them faint music
287,I,"Of rain-washed air,"
288,I,"Or, when each bell lolls out its idiot tongue,"
289,I,"When Time lets drop his cruel scythe,"
290,I,They sing in sympathy.
291,I,"The sun, then, plucks these irons,"
292,I,"As far below,"
293,I,That child
294,I,Draws his stick along the railings.
295,I,The sound of it brings my eye down to him....
296,I,"Oh heart, dry heart,"
297,I,It is yourself again!
298,I,How nearly are we come together!
299,I,"If, at this moment,"
300,I,One long ribbon was unfurled
301,I,"From me to him,"
302,I,I should be shown
303,I,"Above, in a straight line--"
304,I,"A logical growth,"
305,I,"And yet,"
306,I,"I wave, but he will not look up;"
307,I,"I call, but he will not answer."
308,I,
309,I,
310,II,II
311,II,
312,II,From where I stand
313,II,The beauty of the early morning
314,II,Suffocates me;
315,II,It is as if fingers closed round my heart.
316,II,"The light flows down the hills in rivulets,"
317,II,"So you could gather it up in the cup of your hands,"
318,II,"While pools,"
319,II,"The cold eyes of the gods,"
320,II,Are cradled in those hollows.
321,II,"Cool are the clouds,"
322,II,Anchored in the heaven;
323,II,"Green as ice are they,"
324,II,To temper the heat in the valleys
325,II,With arches of violet shadow.
326,II,You can hear from the distant woods
327,II,The thud of the centaurs' hoofs
328,II,"As they gallop down to drink,"
329,II,Shatter the golden roofs
330,II,"Of the trees, for swift as the wind"
331,II,They gallop down to the brink
332,II,"Of the waters that echo their laughter,"
333,II,Cavernous as rolling of boulders down hills;
334,II,"Lolling, they lap at the gurgling waters."
335,II,
336,II,* * * * *
337,II,
338,II,"But nearer rises the sound,"
339,II,"Red, ragged as his comb,"
340,II,Of a cock crowing;
341,II,"A bird flies up to me at the window,"
342,II,"Leaping, like music, with regular rhythm,"
343,II,"Sinks down, then, to the city beneath."
344,II,
345,II,
346,III,III
347,III,
348,III,"Below, the ants are hurrying down the footways,"
349,III,"Dressed, here, in bright colours."
350,III,Under their various intolerable burdens
351,III,They stagger along.
352,III,"Stop to converse, move, wave their antennæ."
353,III,
354,III,* * * * *
355,III,
356,III,"The fruit-seller is opening his stall,"
357,III,"Oranges are piled in minute pyramids,"
358,III,"While melons, green melons,"
359,III,Swing from the roof in string cradles.
360,III,The butcher festoons his shop
361,III,With swags and gay wreaths of entrails;
362,III,"Beautiful heads with horns,"
363,III,"Are nailed up, as on pagan altars,"
364,III,(Though their ears are fresh from the hearing
365,III,Of Orpheus playing his lute).
366,III,
367,III,"The Aguador arranges his glasses,"
368,III,Out of which the sun will strike
369,III,His varying scales of crystal music
370,III,"This afternoon, round the arena."
371,III,"The Matador prepares for the fight,"
372,III,"Is, indeed, already in the Tavern,"
373,III,"Where later and refreshed with blood,"
374,III,He will celebrate his triumph
375,III,Among the poignant kindling
376,III,Of stringéd instruments.
377,III,
378,III,* * * * *
379,III,
380,III,--But the child has run away crying;
381,III,I call--but no answer comes.
382,III,
383,III,
384,IV,IV
385,IV,
386,IV,The chatter of the daylight grows
387,IV,"As I look upon the market-place,"
388,IV,"Where there is a droning of bag-pipes,"
389,IV,"And the hard, wooden music of the hills;"
390,IV,"The housewife has left her cottage in the forest,"
391,IV,Driving here through the early tracks of the sun.
392,IV,"The beggars are already at their posts,"
393,IV,Their dry flesh peeps through their garments.
394,IV,Their old ritual whining
395,IV,Causes no show of pity.
396,IV,"Why should the hucksters, the busy people notice?"
397,IV,"God himself has stood here, out at elbows,"
398,IV,"Waiting patiently in the market-place,"
399,IV,While they chatter in gay booths.
400,IV,"But how I fear for them,"
401,IV,These who are not afraid!
402,IV,I shout to them to make them understand.
403,IV,"They talk more, cease talking and look up,"
404,IV,"They all look up, remain gaping."
405,IV,
406,IV,* * * * *
407,IV,
408,IV,"I went back into the water-cool room,"
409,IV,"Put on my coloured coat, my buskin,"
410,IV,And mask of Harlequin.
411,IV,"They see me, this time."
412,IV,"""Come on, come on,"" they cry,"
413,IV,"""You are just in time."
414,IV,There is fun down here in the market-place.
415,IV,"Two men have been run over,"
416,IV,And there's to be a public execution.
417,IV,The gallows are nearly up.
418,IV,"--And after, in the evening,"
419,IV,"We will go round the wineshops,"
420,IV,"Strumming guitars,"
421,IV,"While trills Dolores in her wide, red skirt."
422,IV,"Oh come on, come on!"""
423,IV,--But the paint from my mask runs down
424,IV,And dyes my clothing.
425,IV,
426,IV,
427,V,V
428,V,
429,V,"It is not thus in the Northern cities,"
430,V,"Where the cold breathes close to the window-pane,"
431,V,Where the brittle flowers of the frost
432,V,Crackle at the window's edge.
433,V,From my window in the Northern city
434,V,"I can hear the rattle and roar of the town,"
435,V,"As the carts go lumbering over the bridges,"
436,V,As the men in dark clothes hurry over the bridges.
437,V,"They do not parade their hearts here,"
438,V,They bury them at their lives' beginning.
439,V,"They must hurry, or they will be late for their work;"
440,V,Their work is their bread.
441,V,"Without bread, how can they work?"
442,V,"They have no time for pleasure,"
443,V,Nor is work any pleasure to them.
444,V,"Their faces are masked with weariness,"
445,V,Drab with their working.
446,V,(Only the tramp who moves among them
447,V,"Unnoticed, despised,"
448,V,Has eyes that have seen).
449,V,"They must work till the guns go again,"
450,V,Giving them their only pretence to glory.
451,V,"They have no time to fear,"
452,V,No time to think of an end.
453,V,Foolishly I called to them on the bridges;
454,V,"Only a few stopped, looked up"
455,V,--But these were convulsed with fury.
456,V,Said one to another
457,V,"""I have never seen a man"
458,V,"Behave like that before."""
459,V,"But most of them were mute,"
460,V,And could not see.
461,V,
462,V,* * * * *
463,V,
464,V,"Through the murkiness of the Northern dawn,"
465,V,The gas already flares out
466,V,"In the glass palaces,"
467,V,"Where to-night, weary and dulled with smoke and with drink,"
468,V,"They will seek, in a brief oblivion,"
469,V,"Laughter, and the mask of Ally Sloper."
470,V,
471,V,* * * * *
472,V,
473,V,"Thus it is in the Northern cities,"
474,V,"Where the cold lies close to the window-pane,"
475,V,Where the grass grows its little blades of steel
476,V,And the wind is armed with seven whips.
477,V,
478,V,
479,VI,VI
480,VI,
481,VI,"Happy is Orpheus as he plays,"
482,VI,"The dumb beasts listen quietly,"
483,VI,"The music strokes their downy ears,"
484,VI,Melts the fierce fire within.
485,VI,
486,VI,"Only with music can you tame the beasts,"
487,VI,Break them of their grizzly feasts;
488,VI,Only with music can you open eyes to wonder.
489,VI,But if they will not hear?
490,VI,"The people have lost faith in music,"
491,VI,"Few are there to call, and none to answer."
492,VI,

494,VI,
495,VI,"When the Prince kissed the Sleeping Beauty,"
496,VI,He broke the wicked spell of cobwebs;
497,VI,"She answered, opened her eyes."
498,VI,
499,VI,"When Narcissus looked into the pool,"
500,VI,The cruel waters gave him their reply
501,VI,--Even that was a better fate
502,VI,Than to cry out in the lonely night
503,VI,--And not to be answered.
504,VI,
505,VI,

507,VII,
508,VII,"From my high window in a Southern city,"
509,VII,Floating above the geometrical array
510,VII,"Of roofs, squares and interlacing streets,"
511,VII,One can see beyond
512,VII,"Into far valleys,"
513,VII,That seem at first
514,VII,To be open blue flowers
515,VII,Scattered here and there on the mountains.
516,VII,"The forests are so far away,"
517,VII,They creep like humble green moss
518,VII,Over slopes that are mountains.
519,VII,And there sounds other music
520,VII,"Than the falling streams,"
521,VII,Or the deep penetrating glow
522,VII,Of sunlight piercing through green leaves.

713,WHEN SOLOMON MET THE QUEEN OF SHEBA,Instead she brought him some Pekoe-trees
714,WHEN SOLOMON MET THE QUEEN OF SHEBA,In a beautiful Chinese bowl

1346,SUBTLETY OF THE SERPENT,Whom the God-of-Man

1350,SUBTLETY OF THE SERPENT,"But Adam and Eve deceived me,"

1374,SUBTLETY OF THE SERPENT,"(Though the man knows evil and therefore prefers it),"
1375,SUBTLETY OF THE SERPENT,But the fact that the monkey
1376,SUBTLETY OF THE SERPENT,"Cannot yet disguise the good with bad words,"

1398,SUBTLETY OF THE SERPENT,"An ape at heart,"
1399,SUBTLETY OF THE SERPENT,A talkative chattering ape.
1400,SUBTLETY OF THE SERPENT,"His curiosity shall discover many strange secrets,"
1401,SUBTLETY OF THE SERPENT,But he will use them
1402,SUBTLETY OF THE SERPENT,"For his two recreations,"
1403,SUBTLETY OF THE SERPENT,"Lying and killing,"
1404,SUBTLETY OF THE SERPENT,Or--as he calls them--
1405,SUBTLETY OF THE SERPENT,Conversation and Sport.
1406,SUBTLETY OF THE SERPENT,His words shall girdle a continent

1414,SUBTLETY OF THE SERPENT,"He shall kill them secretly, without their knowing"
1415,SUBTLETY OF THE SERPENT,As with a thunder-bolt:

2415,V.  AN OLD-FASHIONED SPORTSMAN,He went out into the desert
2416,V.  AN OLD-FASHIONED SPORTSMAN,For forty days
2417,V.  AN OLD-FASHIONED SPORTSMAN,--And never shot anything
2418,V.  AN OLD-FASHIONED SPORTSMAN,And when He hoped He would drown
2419,V.  AN OLD-FASHIONED SPORTSMAN,He walked on the water.

2432,ENGLISH TEA-ROOMS,Outside the sun flashes his strong wings
2433,ENGLISH TEA-ROOMS,"Against the green-slit shutters,"
2434,ENGLISH TEA-ROOMS,Through which you can see
2435,ENGLISH TEA-ROOMS,Him bathing in the street.
2436,ENGLISH TEA-ROOMS,"Like a bird he preens himself at the windows,"
2437,ENGLISH TEA-ROOMS,Then dances back with the swimming flash of a gold-fish.
2438,ENGLISH TEA-ROOMS,"Why do you hiss like geese,"
2439,ENGLISH TEA-ROOMS,"What do you hide,"

2474,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2475,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,The gilt-fring'd earth has sadly spun
2476,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,A sector of its lucent arc
2477,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,About the disillusioned sun
2478,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Of Autumn.  The bright angry spark
2479,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2480,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Of Heaven in each upturned eye
2481,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Denotes religious ecstasy.
2482,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2483,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"We, too, have spun our Sunday round"
2484,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Of Church and beef and after-sleep
2485,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,In houses where obtrudes no sound
2486,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"But breathing, regular and deep,"
2487,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2488,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"Till Sabbath sentiment, well-fed,"
2489,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Demands a visit to the Dead.
2490,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2491,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"For Autumn leaves sad thoughts beget,"
2492,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"As from life's tree they clatter down,"
2493,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,And Death has caught some in her net
2494,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"Even on Sunday,--in this Town,"
2495,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2496,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Tho' money and food and sleep are sweet!
2497,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,The dead leaves rattle down the street.
2498,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2499,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"Fat bodies, silk-enmeshed, inflate"
2500,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Their way along; if Death comes soon
2501,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,They'll leave this food-sweet earth to float
2502,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"Heavenward, like some huge balloon."
2503,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2504,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Religion dims each vacant eye
2505,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,As we approach the cemet'ry.
2506,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2507,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Proudly we walk; with care we bend
2508,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"To lead our children by the hand,"
2509,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"Here, where all, rich and poor, must end"
2510,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,--This portal to a better land
2511,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2512,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,To which--if in good business--
2513,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,We have hereditary access;
2514,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2515,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Where to afford the Saints relief
2516,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"From prayer and from religious questions,"
2517,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Round after round of deathless beef
2518,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Flatters celestial digestions;
2519,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2520,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"Where, in white robe, with golden crown,"
2521,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"We watch our enemies sent down,"
2522,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2523,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"To other spheres, while we lean out,"
2524,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"Divinest pity in our eyes,"
2525,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,And wonder why these sinners flout
2526,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"Our kindly pitying surprise,"
2527,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2528,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Why look so angry when we play
2529,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"On gold harps as they go away,"
2530,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2531,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"A hymn tune, dear, familiar?"
2532,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,But now we stand within the space
2533,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Where marble females drape a tear
2534,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Above a whisker'd marble face.
2535,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2536,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"""Isn't it pretty?""  Even now"
2537,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Rich and exotic blossoms grow
2538,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2539,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,About each granite monument
2540,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"Of men frock-coated, unaware"
2541,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Of Judgment; what emolument
2542,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Requites a weeping willow's care?
2543,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2544,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Look!  Over there a broken column
2545,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"Is watched by one geranium,"
2546,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2547,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Whose scorching scarlet tones uphold
2548,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Damnation and eternal fire
2549,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,To those who will not reckon gold--
2550,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"Who are not worthy of their hire,"
2551,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2552,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,For marble tombs are prized above
2553,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Such brittle things as thought or love.
2554,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2555,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,The crystal web of dusk now clings
2556,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"From evergreen to tropic tree,"
2557,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Toss'd by the wind that subtly brings
2558,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,A mingled scent of mould and tea
2559,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2560,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,That causes silence to be rent
2561,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"By one scream--childish, but intent."
2562,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2563,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,For children will not realise
2564,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,That they should rest without a sound
2565,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,With folded hands and downcast eyes
2566,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"Here, in the Saint's Recruiting Ground."
2567,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2568,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"And so, in sorrow, we turn back"
2569,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,To hasten on our high-tea track.
2570,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2571,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"But after, in the night, we dream"
2572,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"Of Heaven as a marbled bank,"
2573,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"In which, in one continual stream,"
2574,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"We give our gold for heavenly rank,"
2575,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2576,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"Where each Saint, standing like a sentry,"
2577,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,Explains a mystic double-entry.
2578,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
2579,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,The Director of the Bank is God--
2580,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"Stares our foes coldly in the face,"
2581,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,"But gives us quite a friendly nod,"
2582,SUNDAY AFTERNOON,And beckons us to share His place.

2590,CORPSE DAY,
2591,CORPSE DAY,"Dusk floated up from the earth beneath,"
2592,CORPSE DAY,Held in the arms of the evening wind
2593,CORPSE DAY,--The evening wind that softly creeps
2594,CORPSE DAY,"Along the jasper-terraces,"
2595,CORPSE DAY,To bear with it
2596,CORPSE DAY,"The old, sad scent"
2597,CORPSE DAY,"Of midsummer, of trees and flowers"
2598,CORPSE DAY,"Whose bell-shaped blossoms, shaken, torn"
2599,CORPSE DAY,By the rough fingers of the day

2602,CORPSE DAY,* * * * *
2603,CORPSE DAY,

2606,CORPSE DAY,
2607,CORPSE DAY,* * * * *
2608,CORPSE DAY,
2609,CORPSE DAY,"Our Lord Jesus, the Son of Man,"
2610,CORPSE DAY,Smiled
2611,CORPSE DAY,And leant over the ramparts of Heaven.
2612,CORPSE DAY,Beneath Him
2613,CORPSE DAY,Through the welling clouds of darkness
2614,CORPSE DAY,He could see
2615,CORPSE DAY,The swarming of mighty crowds.
2616,CORPSE DAY,"It was in the Christian Continent,"
2617,CORPSE DAY,"Especially,"
2618,CORPSE DAY,That the people chanted
2619,CORPSE DAY,Hymns and pæans of joy.
2620,CORPSE DAY,But it seemed to Our Lord
2621,CORPSE DAY,That through the noisy cries of triumph
2622,CORPSE DAY,He could still detect
2623,CORPSE DAY,A bitter sobbing
2624,CORPSE DAY,--The continuous weeping of widows and children
2625,CORPSE DAY,"Which had haunted Him for so long,"
2626,CORPSE DAY,Though He saw only
2627,CORPSE DAY,"The bonfires,"
2628,CORPSE DAY,"The arches of triumph,"
2629,CORPSE DAY,"The processions,"
2630,CORPSE DAY,And the fireworks
2631,CORPSE DAY,That soared up
2632,CORPSE DAY,"Through the darkening sky,"
2633,CORPSE DAY,To fall in showers of flame
2634,CORPSE DAY,Upon the citadel of Heaven.
2635,CORPSE DAY,"As a rocket burst,"
2636,CORPSE DAY,"There fell from it,"
2637,CORPSE DAY,"Screaming in horror,"
2638,CORPSE DAY,Hundreds of men
2639,CORPSE DAY,Twisted into the likeness of animals
2640,CORPSE DAY,--Writhing men
2641,CORPSE DAY,"Without feet,"
2642,CORPSE DAY,"Without legs,"
2643,CORPSE DAY,"Without arms,"
2644,CORPSE DAY,Without faces....
2645,CORPSE DAY,
2646,CORPSE DAY,The earth-cities still rejoiced.
2647,CORPSE DAY,"Old, fat men leant out to cheer"
2648,CORPSE DAY,From bone-built palaces.
2649,CORPSE DAY,Gold flowed like blood
2650,CORPSE DAY,Through the streets;
2651,CORPSE DAY,Crowds became drunk
2652,CORPSE DAY,On liquor distilled from corpses.
2653,CORPSE DAY,And peering down
2654,CORPSE DAY,The Son of Man looked into the world;
2655,CORPSE DAY,He saw
2656,CORPSE DAY,That within the churches and the temples
2657,CORPSE DAY,His image had been set up;
2658,CORPSE DAY,"But, from time to time,"
2659,CORPSE DAY,"Through twenty centuries,"
2660,CORPSE DAY,The priests had touched up the countenance
2661,CORPSE DAY,So as to make war more easy
2662,CORPSE DAY,Or intimidate the people--
2663,CORPSE DAY,Until now the face
2664,CORPSE DAY,Had become the face of Moloch!
2665,CORPSE DAY,The people did not notice
