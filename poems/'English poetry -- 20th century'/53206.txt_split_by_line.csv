27,PREFATORY NOTE,
28,PREFATORY NOTE,"No Poet represented in this book was over fifty when, in 1919, I began"
29,PREFATORY NOTE,to compile it. The eldest of them all was born in 1870.
30,PREFATORY NOTE,
31,PREFATORY NOTE,Many good and some great living poets are therefore missing from its
32,PREFATORY NOTE,"pages. Nothing is here by Mr Hardy or Mr Bridges, by Mr A. E. Housman,"
33,PREFATORY NOTE,"Mr Yeats, _Æ,_ Mr Binyon, Mr Hewlett, Mr Herbert Trench, Mr Gosse, Mr"
34,PREFATORY NOTE,"Austin Dobson, Mr Doughty, Mr Kipling, Sir Henry Newbolt, Mrs Meynell,"
35,PREFATORY NOTE,"Mrs Woods, Mr Wilfrid Blunt, and others whose names must appear in"
36,PREFATORY NOTE,"any comprehensive anthology from living poets. The date, 1870, was"
37,PREFATORY NOTE,arbitrarily chosen: so would any other date have been. But some date I
38,PREFATORY NOTE,"had to fix, for my object was to illustrate what many of us think an"
39,PREFATORY NOTE,exceptional recent flowering.
40,PREFATORY NOTE,
41,PREFATORY NOTE,"I do not propose to analyse the tendencies, in idea and in method,"
42,PREFATORY NOTE,exhibited in the poems here collected. These things are always
43,PREFATORY NOTE,better seen at a distance; and anyhow the materials are here for
44,PREFATORY NOTE,"the production of an analysis by the reader himself, if he is eager"
45,PREFATORY NOTE,"for one. But I will express one opinion, and call attention to one"
46,PREFATORY NOTE,phenomenon. The opinion is that the majority of the poems in this book
47,PREFATORY NOTE,have merit and that many more could have been printed without lowering
48,PREFATORY NOTE,the standard. And the phenomenon is the simultaneous appearance--the
49,PREFATORY NOTE,result of underlying currents of thought and feeling--of a very large
50,PREFATORY NOTE,number of poets who write only or mainly in lyrical forms. Several
51,PREFATORY NOTE,living poets of the highest repute have won their reputation solely on
52,PREFATORY NOTE,"short poems, and there are, and have been, a very large number indeed"
53,PREFATORY NOTE,who have written one or two good poems.
54,PREFATORY NOTE,
55,PREFATORY NOTE,The better production of our generation has been mainly lyrical and
56,PREFATORY NOTE,it has been widely diffused. Where is the ambitious work on a large
57,PREFATORY NOTE,scale? Where is the twentieth century poet who is fulfilling the usual
58,PREFATORY NOTE,functions of the greatest poets: to display human life in all its range
59,PREFATORY NOTE,"and variety, or to exercise a clear and powerful influence on the"
60,PREFATORY NOTE,thought of mankind with regard to the main problems of our existence?
61,PREFATORY NOTE,These questions are asked; possibly Echo may give its traditional and
62,PREFATORY NOTE,ironic answer.
63,PREFATORY NOTE,
64,PREFATORY NOTE,"There are several observations, however, which should be made. One is"
65,PREFATORY NOTE,that the great doctrinal poets have not always become widely recognised
66,PREFATORY NOTE,"as such in their own prime, their general vogue being posthumous."
67,PREFATORY NOTE,Another is that we cannot possibly tell what a poet now living and
68,PREFATORY NOTE,young may or may not do before he dies. But though I have my own views
69,PREFATORY NOTE,"on this subject I do not think that the age, even if admitted to be"
70,PREFATORY NOTE,"purely lyrical, stands in need of defence. It is of no use asking a"
71,PREFATORY NOTE,"poetical renascence to conform to type, for there isn't any type."
72,PREFATORY NOTE,There are marked differences in the features of all those English
73,PREFATORY NOTE,poetical movements which have chiefly contributed to the body of our
74,PREFATORY NOTE,"""immortal"" poetry. In the Elizabethan age we had the greatest diversity"
75,PREFATORY NOTE,"of production: a multitude of great and small men, with much genius,"
76,PREFATORY NOTE,"or but a spark of it blown to life by the favourable wind, produced"
77,PREFATORY NOTE,"works in every form and on every scale. The age of Herbert and Vaughan,"
78,PREFATORY NOTE,"of Crashaw, Herrick, Marvell, Carew, Suckling, Lovelace, Corbet,"
79,PREFATORY NOTE,"Habington, is memorable almost solely for its lyrical work. The era"
80,PREFATORY NOTE,"of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, and Keats was an age during"
81,PREFATORY NOTE,which a vast amount of great poetry was written by a few great poets;
82,PREFATORY NOTE,there was very little healthy undergrowth. Should our literary age be
83,PREFATORY NOTE,remembered by posterity solely as an age during which fifty men had
84,PREFATORY NOTE,"written lyrics of some durability for their truth and beauty, it would"
85,PREFATORY NOTE,not be remembered with contempt. It is in that conviction that I have
86,PREFATORY NOTE,compiled this anthology.
87,PREFATORY NOTE,
88,PREFATORY NOTE,It is irritating to feel that even within its own limits it does
89,PREFATORY NOTE,not appear to myself--not to mention others--as good or as nearly
90,PREFATORY NOTE,representative as it might have been. Permission could not be obtained
91,PREFATORY NOTE,"to print Mr Masefield's _Biography_ and his _August 1914,_ which I"
92,PREFATORY NOTE,personally happen to prefer to any of his shorter works. Since the time
93,PREFATORY NOTE,in 1919-20 when I was compiling the book two volumes have come out from
94,PREFATORY NOTE,which I should like to have made large seleetions: Edmund Blunden's
95,PREFATORY NOTE,_The Waggoner_ and the late Wilfrid Owen's _Poems._ Each of these poets
96,PREFATORY NOTE,"is inadequately represented here; and a few things by others, who do"
97,PREFATORY NOTE,"not appear here at all, came to my notice when it was too late to put"
98,PREFATORY NOTE,them in.
99,PREFATORY NOTE,
100,PREFATORY NOTE,I have to thank the living poets from whose works I have drawn for
101,PREFATORY NOTE,permitting me to use everything I wanted. I am grateful to Mrs
102,PREFATORY NOTE,"Brooke and Rupert Brooke's literary executor, Mr Edward Marsh (whose"
103,PREFATORY NOTE,"""Georgian"" collections have been a great stimulus and help to me) for"
104,PREFATORY NOTE,permission to use a selection from Brooke; to Mrs J. E. Flecker for
105,PREFATORY NOTE,"poems by her husband; to Lady Desborough for the poems by her son,"
106,PREFATORY NOTE,Julian Grenfell; to Lord Dunsany for the poems by Francis Ledwidge; to
107,PREFATORY NOTE,Mrs Thomas Macdonagh and Mrs Joseph Plunkett for the poems by their
108,PREFATORY NOTE,husbands; to Mrs Owen for her son Wilfrid Owen's _Strange Meeting;_
109,PREFATORY NOTE,"to Professor W. R. Sorley for the poems by his son, Charles Sorley;"
110,PREFATORY NOTE,"to Lady Glenconner for those by her son, Edward Wyndham Tennant; to"
111,PREFATORY NOTE,Mrs Edward Thomas for the poems (published too late for him ever to
112,PREFATORY NOTE,know-how people would admire them) by Edward Thomas.
113,PREFATORY NOTE,
114,PREFATORY NOTE,"Finally, almost every publisher in the kingdom has assisted the book"
115,PREFATORY NOTE,with permission to reprint copyright poems. The full list of publishers
116,PREFATORY NOTE,"and works is as follows: Messrs Bell (Edward L. Davison, _Poems_);"

159,MARRIAGE SONG,
160,MARRIAGE SONG,"Come up, dear chosen morning, come,"
161,MARRIAGE SONG,"Blessing the air with light,"
162,MARRIAGE SONG,And bid the sky repent of being dark:
163,MARRIAGE SONG,"Let all the spaces round the world be white,"
164,MARRIAGE SONG,And give the earth her green again.
165,MARRIAGE SONG,"Into new hours of beautiful delight,"
166,MARRIAGE SONG,"Out of the shadow where she has lain,"
167,MARRIAGE SONG,"Bring the earth awake for glee,"
168,MARRIAGE SONG,Shining with dews as fresh and clear
169,MARRIAGE SONG,As my beloved's voice upon the air.
170,MARRIAGE SONG,"For now, O morning chosen of all days, on thee"
171,MARRIAGE SONG,A wondrous duty lies:
172,MARRIAGE SONG,There was an evening that did loveliness foretell;
173,MARRIAGE SONG,"Thence upon thee, O chosen morn, it fell"
174,MARRIAGE SONG,To fashion into perfect destiny
175,MARRIAGE SONG,The radiant prophecy.
176,MARRIAGE SONG,"For in an evening of young moon, that went"
177,MARRIAGE SONG,"Filling the moist air with a rosy fire,"
178,MARRIAGE SONG,I and my beloved knew our love;
179,MARRIAGE SONG,"And knew that thou, O morning, wouldst arise"
180,MARRIAGE SONG,To give us knowledge of achieved desire.
181,MARRIAGE SONG,"For, standing stricken with astonishment,"
182,MARRIAGE SONG,"Half terrified in the delight,"
183,MARRIAGE SONG,Even as the moon did into clear air move
184,MARRIAGE SONG,"And made a golden light,"
185,MARRIAGE SONG,"Lo there, croucht up against it, a dark hill,"
186,MARRIAGE SONG,"A monstrous back of earth, a spine"
187,MARRIAGE SONG,"Of hunchèd rock, furred with great growth of pine,"
188,MARRIAGE SONG,"Lay like a beast, snout in its paws, asleep;"
189,MARRIAGE SONG,"Yet in its sleeping seemed it miserable,"
190,MARRIAGE SONG,As though strong fear must always keep
191,MARRIAGE SONG,"Hold of its heart, and drive its blood in dream."
192,MARRIAGE SONG,"Yea, for to our new love, did it not seem,"
193,MARRIAGE SONG,"That dark and quiet length of hill,"
194,MARRIAGE SONG,The sleeping grief of the world?--Out of it we
195,MARRIAGE SONG,Had like imaginations stept to be
196,MARRIAGE SONG,Beauty and golden wonder; and for the lovely fear
197,MARRIAGE SONG,"Of coming perfect joy, had changed"
198,MARRIAGE SONG,The terror that dreamt there I
199,MARRIAGE SONG,And now the golden moon had turned
200,MARRIAGE SONG,"To shining white, white as our souls that burned"
201,MARRIAGE SONG,With vision of our prophecy assured:
202,MARRIAGE SONG,Suddenly white was the moon; but she
203,MARRIAGE SONG,At once did on a woven modesty
204,MARRIAGE SONG,"Of cloud, and soon went in obscured:"
205,MARRIAGE SONG,"And we were dark, and vanisht that strange hill."
206,MARRIAGE SONG,But yet it was not long before
207,MARRIAGE SONG,"There opened in the sky a narrow door,"
208,MARRIAGE SONG,Made with pearl lintel and pearl sill;
209,MARRIAGE SONG,"And the earth's night seem'd pressing there,--"
210,MARRIAGE SONG,"All as a beggar on some festival would peer,--"
211,MARRIAGE SONG,"To gaze into a room of light beyond,"
212,MARRIAGE SONG,The hidden silver splendour of the moon.
213,MARRIAGE SONG,"Yea, and we also, we"
214,MARRIAGE SONG,Long gazed wistfully
215,MARRIAGE SONG,"Towards thee, O morning, come at last,"
216,MARRIAGE SONG,And towards the light that thou wilt pour upon us soon!

221,II,"O soul who still art strange to sense,"
222,II,"Who often against beauty wouldst complain,"
223,II,Doubting between joy and pain
224,II,If like the startling touch of something keen
225,II,"Against thee, it hath been"
226,II,To follow from an upland height
227,II,The swift sun hunting rain
228,II,"Across the April meadows of a plain,"
229,II,Until the fields would flash into the air
230,II,"Their joyous green, like emeralds alight"
231,II,Or when in the blue of night's mid-noon
232,II,The burning naked moon
233,II,"Draws to a brink of cloudy weather near,"
234,II,"A breadth of snow, firm and soft as a wing,"
235,II,"Stretcht out over a wind that gently goes,--"
236,II,Through the white sleep of snowy cloud there grows
237,II,"An azure-border'd shining ring,"
238,II,The gleaming dream of the approaching joy of her;--
239,II,"What now wilt thou do, Soul? What now,"
240,II,If with such things as these troubled thou wert?
241,II,"How wilt thou now endure, or how"
242,II,Not now be strangely hurt?--When
243,II,utter beauty must come closer to thee
244,II,Than even anger or fear could be;
245,II,"When thou, like metal in a kiln, must lie"
246,II,Seized by beauty's mightily able flame;
247,II,Enjoyed by beauty as by the ruthless glee
248,II,Of an unescapable power;
249,II,Obeying beauty as air obeys a cry;
250,II,"Yea, one thing made of beauty and thee,"
251,II,As steel and a white heat are made the same!
252,II,"--Ah, but I know how this infirmity"
253,II,"Will fail and be not, no, not memory,"
254,II,When I begin the marvellous hour.
255,II,"This only is my heart's strain'd eagerness,"
256,II,Long waiting for its bliss.--
257,II,"But from those other fears, from those"
258,II,"That keep to Love so close,"
259,II,"From fears that are the shadow of delight,"
260,II,"Hide me, O joys; make them unknown to-night!"

263,III,III
264,III,
265,III,"Thou bright God that in dream earnest to me last night,"
266,III,"Thou with the flesh made of a golden light,"
267,III,"Knew I not thee, thee and thy heart,"
268,III,"Knew I not well, God, who thou wert?"
269,III,"Yea, and my soul divinely understood"
270,III,"The light that was beneath thee a ground,"
271,III,"The golden light that cover'd thee round,"
272,III,"Turning my sleep to a fiery morn,"
273,III,Was as a heavenly oath there sworn
274,III,Promising me an immortal good:
275,III,"Well I knew thee, God of Marriages, thee and thy flame!"
276,III,"Ah, but wherefore beside thee came"
277,III,That fearful sight of another mood?
278,III,"Why in thy light, to thy hand chained,"
279,III,"Towards me its bondage terribly strained,"
280,III,"Why came with thee that dreadful hound,"
281,III,"The wild hound Fear, black, ravenous, and gaunt?"
282,III,Why him with thee should thy dear light surround?
283,III,Why broughtest thou that beast to haunt
284,III,The blissful footsteps of my golden dream?--
285,III,"All shadowy black the body dread,"
286,III,"All frenzied fire the head,--"
287,III,"The hunger of its mouth a hollow crimson flame,"
288,III,The hatred in its eyes a blaze
289,III,"Fierce and green, stabbing the ruddy glaze,"
290,III,"And sharp white jetting fire the teeth snarl'd at me,"
291,III,"And white the dribbling rage of froth,--"
292,III,"A throat that gaped to bay and paws working violently,"
293,III,Yet soundless all as a winging moth;
294,III,"Tugging towards me, famishing for my heart;--"
295,III,"Even while thou, O golden god, wert still"
296,III,Looking the beautiful kindness of thy will
297,III,"Into my soul, even then must I be,"
298,III,"With thy bright promise looking at me,"
299,III,Then bitterly of that hound afraid?--
300,III,"Darkness, I know, attendeth bright,"
301,III,And light comes not but shadow comes:
302,III,"And heart must know, if it know thy light,"
303,III,"Thy wild hound Fear, the shadow of love's delight."
304,III,"Yea, is it thus? Are we so made"
305,III,"Of death and darkness, that even thou,"
306,III,"O golden God of the joys of love,"
307,III,"Thy mind to us canst only prove,"
308,III,"The glorious devices of thy mind,"
309,III,By so revealing how thy journeying here
310,III,"Through this mortality, doth closely bind"
311,III,Thy brightness to the shadow of dreadful Fear?--
312,III,"Ah no, it shall not be! Thy joyous light"
313,III,Shall hide me from the hunger of fear to-night.
314,III,

316,IV,IV
317,IV,
318,IV,For wonderfully to live I now begin.
319,IV,So that the darkness which accompanies
320,IV,"Our being here, is fasten'd up within"
321,IV,The power of light that holdeth me;
322,IV,"And from these shining chains, to see"
323,IV,"My joy with bold misliking eyes,"
324,IV,The shrouded figure will not dare arise.
325,IV,"For henceforth, from to-night,"
326,IV,I am wholly gone into the bright
327,IV,Safety of the beauty of love:
328,IV,Not only all my waking vigours plied
329,IV,"Under the searching glory of love,"
330,IV,But knowing myself with love all satisfied
331,IV,Even when my life is hidden in sleep;
332,IV,"As high clouds, to themselves that keep"
333,IV,"The moon's white company, are all possest"
334,IV,Silverly with the presence of their guest;
335,IV,Or as a darken'd room
336,IV,"That hath within it roses, whence the air"
337,IV,And quietness are taken everywhere
338,IV,Deliciously by sweet perfume.

343,EPILOGUE,What shall we do for Love these days?
344,EPILOGUE,How shall we make an altar-blaze
345,EPILOGUE,To smite the horny eyes of men
346,EPILOGUE,"With the renown of our Heaven,"
347,EPILOGUE,And to the unbelievers prove
348,EPILOGUE,"Our service to our dear god, Love?"
349,EPILOGUE,What torches shall we lift above
350,EPILOGUE,"The crowd that pushes through the mire,"
351,EPILOGUE,To amaze the dark heads with strange fire?
352,EPILOGUE,"I should think I were much to blame,"
353,EPILOGUE,If never I held some fragrant flame
354,EPILOGUE,"Above the noises of the world,"
355,EPILOGUE,"And openly 'mid men's hurrying stares,"
356,EPILOGUE,Worshipt before the sacred fears
357,EPILOGUE,That are like flashing curtains furl'd
358,EPILOGUE,Across the presence of our lord Love.
359,EPILOGUE,"Nay, would that I could fill the gaze"
360,EPILOGUE,Of the whole earth with some great praise
361,EPILOGUE,"Made in a marvel for men's eyes,"
362,EPILOGUE,"Some tower of glittering masonries,"
363,EPILOGUE,Therein such a spirit flourishing
364,EPILOGUE,Men should see what my heart can sing:
365,EPILOGUE,All that Love hath done to me
366,EPILOGUE,"Built into stone, a visible glee;"
367,EPILOGUE,Marble carried to gleaming height
368,EPILOGUE,As moved aloft by inward delight;
369,EPILOGUE,"Not as with toil of chisels hewn,"
370,EPILOGUE,But seeming poised in a mighty tune.
371,EPILOGUE,For of all those who have been known
372,EPILOGUE,"To lodge with our kind host, the sun,"
373,EPILOGUE,I envy one for just one thing:
374,EPILOGUE,In Cordova of the Moors
375,EPILOGUE,"There dwelt a passion-minded King,"
376,EPILOGUE,Who set great bands of marble-hewers
377,EPILOGUE,To fashion his heart's thanksgiving
378,EPILOGUE,"In a tall palace, shapen so"
379,EPILOGUE,All the wondering world might know
380,EPILOGUE,The joy he had of his Moorish lass.
381,EPILOGUE,"His love, that brighter and larger was"
382,EPILOGUE,"Than the starry places, into firm stone"
383,EPILOGUE,"He sent, as if the stone were glass"
384,EPILOGUE,Fired and into beauty blown.
385,EPILOGUE,
386,EPILOGUE,Solemn and invented gravely
387,EPILOGUE,"In its bulk the fabric stood,"
388,EPILOGUE,"Even as Love, that trusteth bravely"
389,EPILOGUE,In its own exceeding good
390,EPILOGUE,To be better than the waste
391,EPILOGUE,"Of time's devices; grandly spaced,"
392,EPILOGUE,Seriously the fabric stood.
393,EPILOGUE,But over it all a pleasure went
394,EPILOGUE,"Of carven delicate ornament,"
395,EPILOGUE,"Wreathing up like ravishment,"
396,EPILOGUE,Mentioning in sculptures twined
397,EPILOGUE,The blitheness Love hath in his mind;
398,EPILOGUE,And like delighted senses were
399,EPILOGUE,"The windows, and the columns there"
400,EPILOGUE,Made the following sight to ache
401,EPILOGUE,As the heart that did them make.
402,EPILOGUE,Well I can see that shining song
403,EPILOGUE,"Flowering there, the upward throng"
404,EPILOGUE,"Of porches, pillars and windowed walls,"
405,EPILOGUE,"Spires like piercing panpipe calls,"
406,EPILOGUE,Up to the roof's snow-cloud flight;
407,EPILOGUE,All glancing in the Spanish light
408,EPILOGUE,"White as water of arctic tides,"
409,EPILOGUE,Save an amber dazzle on sunny sides.
410,EPILOGUE,"You had said, the radiant sheen"
411,EPILOGUE,Of that palace might have been

914,ALMSWOMEN,And there in the almshouse dwell the dearest friends
915,ALMSWOMEN,"Of all the village, two old dames that cling"
916,ALMSWOMEN,As close as any trueloves in the spring.
917,ALMSWOMEN,"Long, long ago they passed three-score-and-ten,"
918,ALMSWOMEN,And in this doll's house lived together then;
919,ALMSWOMEN,"All things they have in common being so poor,"
920,ALMSWOMEN,"And their one fear, Death's shadow at the door."
921,ALMSWOMEN,"Each sundown makes them mournful, each sunrise"
922,ALMSWOMEN,Brings back the brightness in their failing eyes.
923,ALMSWOMEN,
924,ALMSWOMEN,How happy go the rich fair-weather days
925,ALMSWOMEN,When on the roadside folk stare in amaze
926,ALMSWOMEN,At such a honeycomb of fruit and flowers
927,ALMSWOMEN,As mellows round their threshold; what long hours
928,ALMSWOMEN,"They gloat upon their steepling hollyhocks,"
929,ALMSWOMEN,"Bee's balsams, feathery southernwood and stocks,"
930,ALMSWOMEN,"Fiery dragons'-mouths, great mallow leaves"
931,ALMSWOMEN,"For salves, and lemon plants in bushy sheaves,"
932,ALMSWOMEN,Shagged Esau's Hands with five green finger-tips!
933,ALMSWOMEN,Such old sweet names are ever on their lips.
934,ALMSWOMEN,As pleased as little children where these grow
935,ALMSWOMEN,"In cobbled pattens and worn gowns they go,"
936,ALMSWOMEN,Proud of their wisdom when on gooseberry shoots
937,ALMSWOMEN,They stuck egg-shells to fright from coming fruits
938,ALMSWOMEN,The brisk-billed rascals; waiting still to see
939,ALMSWOMEN,Their neighbour owls saunter from tree to tree
940,ALMSWOMEN,Or in the hushing half-light mouse the lane
941,ALMSWOMEN,Long-winged and lordly.
942,ALMSWOMEN,
943,ALMSWOMEN,But when those hours wane
944,ALMSWOMEN,"Indoors they ponder, scared by the harsh storm"
945,ALMSWOMEN,"Whose pelting saracens on the window swarm,"
946,ALMSWOMEN,And listen for the mail to clatter past
947,ALMSWOMEN,And church clock's deep bay withering on the blast;
948,ALMSWOMEN,They feed the fire that flings a freakish light
949,ALMSWOMEN,"On pictured kings and queens grotesquely bright,"
950,ALMSWOMEN,"Platters and pitchers, faded calendars,"
951,ALMSWOMEN,And graceful hour-glass trim with lavenders.
952,ALMSWOMEN,"Many a time they kiss and cry, and pray"
953,ALMSWOMEN,"Both may be summoned in the self-same day,"
954,ALMSWOMEN,And wiseman linnet tinkling in his cage
955,ALMSWOMEN,"End too with them the friendship of old age,"

964,GLEANING,
965,GLEANING,Along the baulk the grasses drenched in dews
966,GLEANING,"Soak through the morning gleaners' clumsy shoes,"
967,GLEANING,And cloying cobwebs trammel their brown cheeks
968,GLEANING,While from the shouldering sun the dewfog reeks.
969,GLEANING,"Then soon begun, on ground where yesterday"
970,GLEANING,"The rakers' warning-sheaf forbade their way,"
971,GLEANING,Hard clucking dames in great white hoods make haste
972,GLEANING,"To cram their lap-bags with the barley waste,"
973,GLEANING,"Scrambling as if a thousand were but one,"
974,GLEANING,Careless of stabbing thistles. Now the sun
975,GLEANING,"Gulps up the dew and dries the stubs, and scores"
976,GLEANING,Of tiny people trundle out of doors
977,GLEANING,"Among the stiff stalks, where the scratched hands"
978,GLEANING,Red ants and blackamoors and such as fly;
979,GLEANING,"Tunbellied, too, with legs a finger long,"
980,GLEANING,"The spider harvestman; the churlish, strong"
981,GLEANING,"Black scorpion, prickled earwig, and that mite"
982,GLEANING,Who shuts up like a leaden shot in fright
983,GLEANING,And lies for dead. And still before the rout
984,GLEANING,The young rats and the field mice whisk about
985,GLEANING,And from the trod whisp out the leveret darts
986,GLEANING,Bawled at by boys that pass with blundering carts
987,GLEANING,Top-heavy to the red-tiled barns. And still
988,GLEANING,"The children feed their cornsacks with goodwill,"
989,GLEANING,And farm wives ever faster stoop and flounce.
990,GLEANING,The hawk drops down a plummet's speed to pounce
991,GLEANING,"The nibbling mouse or resting lark away,"
992,GLEANING,The lost mole tries to pierce the mattocked clay
993,GLEANING,In agony and terror of the sun.
994,GLEANING,
995,GLEANING,"The dinner hour and its grudged leisure won,"
996,GLEANING,"All sit below the pollards on the dykes,"
997,GLEANING,Rasped with the twinge of creeping barley spikes:
998,GLEANING,Sweet beyond telling now the small beer goes
999,GLEANING,"From the hooped hardwood bottles, the wasp knows,"
1000,GLEANING,And even hornets whizz from the eaten ash--
1001,GLEANING,"Then crusts are dropt and switches snatched to slash,"
1002,GLEANING,"While, safe in shadow of the apron thrown"
1003,GLEANING,Aside the bush which years before was grown
1004,GLEANING,"To snap the poacher's nets, the baby sleeps."
1005,GLEANING,"Now toil returns, in red-hot fluttering light,"
1006,GLEANING,"And far afield the weary rabble creeps,"
1007,GLEANING,"Oft clutching blind wheat black among the white,"
1008,GLEANING,That smutches where it touches quick as soot--Oft
1009,GLEANING,"gaping where the landrail seems afoot,"
1010,GLEANING,"Who with such magic throws his baffling speech,"
1011,GLEANING,Far off he sounds when scarce beyond arm's reach.
1012,GLEANING,"Mongrels are left to mind the morning's gain,"
1013,GLEANING,But squinting knaves can slouch to steal the grain;
1014,GLEANING,"Now close the farm the fields are gleaned agen,"
1015,GLEANING,Where the boy droves the turkey and white hen
1016,GLEANING,To pick the shelled sweet corn; their hue and cry
1017,GLEANING,"Answers the gleaners' gabble, and sows trudge"
1018,GLEANING,With little pigs to play and rootle there
1019,GLEANING,And all the fields are full of din and blare.
1020,GLEANING,
1021,GLEANING,"So steals the time past, so they glean and gloat;"
1022,GLEANING,"The hobby-horses whir, the moth's dust coat"
1023,GLEANING,"Blends with the stubble, scarlet soldiers fly"
1024,GLEANING,In airy pleasure; but the gleaners' eye
1025,GLEANING,"Sees little but their spoil, or robin flower"
1026,GLEANING,"Ever on tenterhooks to shun the shower,"
1027,GLEANING,Their weather-prophet never known astray;
1028,GLEANING,"When he folds up, then toward the hedge glean they."
1029,GLEANING,"But now the dragon of the sky droops, pales,"
1030,GLEANING,"And wandering in the wet grey western vales,"
1031,GLEANING,"Stumbles, and passes, and the gleaning's done."
1032,GLEANING,"The farmer, with fat hares slung on his gun,"
1033,GLEANING,Gives folk goodnight as down the ruts they pull
1034,GLEANING,"The creaking two-wheeled hand carts bursting full,"
1035,GLEANING,"And whimpering children cease their teasing squalls,"
1036,GLEANING,While left alone the supping partridge calls--
1037,GLEANING,Till all at home is stacked from mischief's way
1038,GLEANING,"To thrash and dress the first wild, windy day,"
1039,GLEANING,"And each good wife crowns weariness with pride,"
1040,GLEANING,With such small riches more than satisfied.

1200,THE END OF THE WORLD,"There was no wind, but now and then a sigh"

1274,ATLANTIS,And then misunderstood and worshipped him;
1275,ATLANTIS,"A woman was lovely and men fought for her,"
1276,ATLANTIS,"Towns burnt for her, and men put men in bondage,"
1277,ATLANTIS,But she put lengthier bondage on them all;
1278,ATLANTIS,A wanderer toiled among all the isles
1279,ATLANTIS,"That fleck this turning star or shifting sea,"
1280,ATLANTIS,"Or lonely purgatories of the mind,"
1281,ATLANTIS,In longing for his home or his lost love.
1282,ATLANTIS,
1283,ATLANTIS,Poetry is founded on the hearts of men:
1284,ATLANTIS,Though in Nirvana or the Heavenly courts
1285,ATLANTIS,"The principle of beauty shall persist,"
1286,ATLANTIS,"Its body of poetry, as the body of man,"
1287,ATLANTIS,"Is but a terrene form, a terrene use,"

1762,DINING-ROOM TEA,"Laughing and looking, one of all,"
1763,DINING-ROOM TEA,I watched the quivering lamplight fall
1764,DINING-ROOM TEA,On plate and flowers and pouring tea
1765,DINING-ROOM TEA,And cup and cloth; and they and we
1766,DINING-ROOM TEA,Flung all the dancing moments by
1767,DINING-ROOM TEA,With jest and glitter. Lip and eye
1768,DINING-ROOM TEA,"Flashed on the glory, shone and cried,"
1769,DINING-ROOM TEA,"Improvident, unmemoried;"
1770,DINING-ROOM TEA,And fitfully and like a flame

1778,DINING-ROOM TEA,From the dark woven flow of change
1779,DINING-ROOM TEA,Under a vast and starless sky
1780,DINING-ROOM TEA,I saw the immortal moment lie.
1781,DINING-ROOM TEA,"One instant I, an instant, knew"
1782,DINING-ROOM TEA,As God knows all. And it and you
1783,DINING-ROOM TEA,"I, above Time, oh, blind! could see"

1785,DINING-ROOM TEA,"I saw the marble cup; the tea,"
1786,DINING-ROOM TEA,"Hung on the air, an amber stream;"
1787,DINING-ROOM TEA,"I saw the fire's unglittering gleam,"
1788,DINING-ROOM TEA,"The painted flame, the frozen smoke."
1789,DINING-ROOM TEA,No more the flooding lamplight broke
1790,DINING-ROOM TEA,On flying eyes and lips and hair;
1791,DINING-ROOM TEA,"But lay, but slept unbroken there,"
1792,DINING-ROOM TEA,"On stiller flesh, and body breathless,"
1793,DINING-ROOM TEA,"And lips and laughter stayed and deathless,"
1794,DINING-ROOM TEA,And words on which no silence grew.
1795,DINING-ROOM TEA,Light was more alive than you.
1796,DINING-ROOM TEA,
1797,DINING-ROOM TEA,"For suddenly, and otherwhence,"
1798,DINING-ROOM TEA,I looked on your magnificence.
1799,DINING-ROOM TEA,"I saw the stillness and the light,"

1807,DINING-ROOM TEA,Dazed at length

1810,DINING-ROOM TEA,Change closed about me like a sleep.
1811,DINING-ROOM TEA,Light glinted on the eyes I loved.
1812,DINING-ROOM TEA,The cup was filled. The bodies moved.
1813,DINING-ROOM TEA,The drifting petal came to ground.
1814,DINING-ROOM TEA,The laughter chimed its perfect round.
1815,DINING-ROOM TEA,The broken syllable was ended.
1816,DINING-ROOM TEA,"And I, so certain and so friended,"
1817,DINING-ROOM TEA,"How could I cloud, or how distress"
1818,DINING-ROOM TEA,The heaven of your unconsciousness?
1819,DINING-ROOM TEA,"Or shake at Time's sufficient spell,"

1821,DINING-ROOM TEA,"The eternal holiness of you,"
1822,DINING-ROOM TEA,"The timeless end, you never knew,"

1824,DINING-ROOM TEA,You never knew that I had gone

1826,DINING-ROOM TEA,A million years. The laughter played
1827,DINING-ROOM TEA,Unbroken round me; and the jest
1828,DINING-ROOM TEA,Flashed on. And we that knew the best
1829,DINING-ROOM TEA,Down wonderful hours grew happier yet.
1830,DINING-ROOM TEA,"I sang at heart, and talked, and eat,"

2788,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,
2789,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,
2790,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,I shall come back to die
2791,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,From a far place at last
2792,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,After my life's carouse
2793,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,"In the old bed to lie,"
2794,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Remembering the past
2795,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,In this dark house.
2796,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,
2797,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Because of a clock's chime
2798,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,In the long waste of night
2799,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,I shall awake and wait
2800,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,At that calm lonely time
2801,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Each smell and sound and sight
2802,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Mysterious and innate:
2803,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Some shadow on the wall
2804,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,When curtains by the door
2805,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Move in a draught of wind;
2806,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Or else a light footfall
2807,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,In a near corridor;
2808,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Even to feel the kind
2809,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Caress of a cool hand
2810,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Smoothing the draggled hair
2811,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,"Back from my shrunken brow,"
2812,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,And strive to understand
2813,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,"The woman's presence there,"
2814,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,"And whence she came, and how."
2815,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,
2816,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,What gust of wind that night
2817,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Shall mutter her lost name
2818,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,"Through windows open wide,"
2819,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,And twist the nickering light
2820,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Of a sole candle's flame
2821,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,"Smoking from side to side,"
2822,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Till the last spark it blows
2823,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Sets a moth's wings aflare
2824,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,As the faint flame goes out?
2825,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,
2826,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Some distant door may close;
2827,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Perhaps a heavy chair
2828,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,On bare floors dragged about
2829,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,"O'er the low ceiling sound,"
2830,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,And the thin twig of a tree
2831,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Knock on my window-pane
2832,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Till all the night around
2833,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,"Is listening with me,"
2834,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,While like a noise of rain
2835,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Leaves rustle in the wind.
2836,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,
2837,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Then from the inner gloom
2838,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,The scratching of a mouse
2839,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,May echo down my mind
2840,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,And sound around the room
2841,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,In this dark house.
2842,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,
2843,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,"The vague scent of a flower,"
2844,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Smelt then in that warm air
2845,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,"From gardens drifting in,"
2846,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,May slowly overpower
2847,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,"The vapid lavender,"
2848,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Till feebly I begin
2849,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,To count the scents I knew
2850,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,"And name them one by one,"
2851,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,And search the names for this.
2852,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,
2853,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Dreams will be swift and few
2854,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,"Ere that last night be done,"
2855,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,And gradual silences
2856,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,In each long interim
2857,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Of halting time awake
2858,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Confuse all conscious sense.
2859,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,"Shadows will grow more dim,"
2860,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,And sound and scent forsake
2861,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,"The dark ere dawn commence,"
2862,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,
2863,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,"In the new morning then,"
2864,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,"So fixed the stare and fast,"
2865,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,The calm unseeing eye
2866,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,Will never close again.
2867,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,
2868,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,.    .    .    .
2869,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,
2870,IN THIS DARK HOUSE,I shall come back at last

2885,THE LISTENERS,Knocking on the moonlit door;
2886,THE LISTENERS,And his horse in the silence champed the grasses
2887,THE LISTENERS,Of the forest's ferny floor:
2888,THE LISTENERS,"And a bird flew up out of the turret,"
2889,THE LISTENERS,Above the Traveller's head:
2890,THE LISTENERS,And he smote upon the door again a second time;

2892,THE LISTENERS,But no one descended to the Traveller;
2893,THE LISTENERS,No head from the leaf-fringed sill
2894,THE LISTENERS,"Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,"
2895,THE LISTENERS,Where he stood perplexed and still.
2896,THE LISTENERS,But only a host of phantom listeners
2897,THE LISTENERS,That dwelt in the lone house then
2898,THE LISTENERS,Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight
2899,THE LISTENERS,To that voice from the world of men:
2900,THE LISTENERS,"Stood thronging the faint moon beams on the dark stair,"
2901,THE LISTENERS,"That goes down to the empty hall,"
2902,THE LISTENERS,Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken
2903,THE LISTENERS,By the lonely traveller's call.
2904,THE LISTENERS,"And he felt in his heart their strangeness,"
2905,THE LISTENERS,"Their stillness answering his cry,"
2906,THE LISTENERS,"While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,"
2907,THE LISTENERS,'Neath the starred and leafy sky;
2908,THE LISTENERS,"For he suddenly smote on the door, even"
2909,THE LISTENERS,"Louder, and lifted his head:--"
2910,THE LISTENERS,"""Tell them I came, and no one answered,"
2911,THE LISTENERS,"That I kept my word,"" he said."
2912,THE LISTENERS,"Never the least stir made the listeners,"
2913,THE LISTENERS,Though every word he spake
2914,THE LISTENERS,Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house
2915,THE LISTENERS,From the one man left awake:
2916,THE LISTENERS,"Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,"
2917,THE LISTENERS,And the sound of iron on stone

3968,THE BODY,
3969,THE BODY,"A flame in her arms and in each finger flame,"

3972,THE BODY,From foot to head did flame into red flame flow.
3973,THE BODY,
3974,THE BODY,"I knew how beauty seen from unseen must rise,"
3975,THE BODY,How the body's joy for more than body's use was made.

4074,WAKING,"Until, slowly, from deep to lesser deep"

4076,WAKING,But only air and light ...
4077,WAKING,

4081,WAKING,And none when I awoke stranger or sweeter.
4082,WAKING,"Awake, the strangeness still hung over me"
4083,WAKING,As I with far-strayed senses stared at the light.
4084,WAKING,
4085,WAKING,I--and who was I?
4086,WAKING,"Saw--oh, with what unaccustomed eye!"
4087,WAKING,The room was strange and everything strange
4088,WAKING,Like a strange room entered by wild moonlight;
4089,WAKING,And yet familiar as the light swept over me
4090,WAKING,And I rose from the night.
4091,WAKING,
4092,WAKING,Strange--yet stranger I.
4093,WAKING,And as one climbs from water up to land
4094,WAKING,"Fumbling for weedy steps with foot and hand,"
4095,WAKING,So I for yesterdays whereon to climb
4096,WAKING,To this remote and new-struck isle of time.
4097,WAKING,But I found not myself nor yesterday--
4098,WAKING,
4099,WAKING,"Until, slowly, from deep to lesser deep"
4100,WAKING,"Risen, I felt the seas no longer over me"
4101,WAKING,But only air and light.
4102,WAKING,"Yes, like one clutching at a ring I heard"
4103,WAKING,"The household noises as they stirred,"
4104,WAKING,"And holding fast I wondered, What were they?"
4105,WAKING,
4106,WAKING,"I felt a strange hand lying at my side,"
4107,WAKING,Limp and cool. I touched it and knew it mine.
4108,WAKING,"A murmur, and I remembered how the wind died"
4109,WAKING,In the near aspens. Then
4110,WAKING,Strange things were no more strange.
4111,WAKING,I travelled among common thoughts again;
4112,WAKING,
4113,WAKING,And felt the new-forged links of that strong chain
4114,WAKING,"That binds me to myself, and this to-day"
4115,WAKING,To yesterday. I heard it rattling near
4116,WAKING,With a no more astonished ear.
4117,WAKING,"And I had lost the strangeness of that sleep,"
4118,WAKING,No more the long night rolled its great seas over me.
4119,WAKING,
4120,WAKING,"--O, too anxious I!"
4121,WAKING,For in this press of things familiar
4122,WAKING,I have lost all that clung
4123,WAKING,Round me awaking of strangeness and such sweetness.
4124,WAKING,Nothing now is strange
4125,WAKING,Except the man that woke and then was I.

4130,THE CHAIR,THE CHAIR
4131,THE CHAIR,
4132,THE CHAIR,
4133,THE CHAIR,The chair was made
4134,THE CHAIR,"By hands long dead,"
4135,THE CHAIR,"Polished by many bodies sitting there,"
4136,THE CHAIR,Until the wood-lines flowed as clean as waves.
4137,THE CHAIR,
4138,THE CHAIR,"Mine sat restless there,"
4139,THE CHAIR,Or propped to stare
4140,THE CHAIR,Hugged the low kitchen with fond eyes
4141,THE CHAIR,Or tired eyes that looked at nothing at all.
4142,THE CHAIR,
4143,THE CHAIR,Or watched from the smoke rise
4144,THE CHAIR,"The flame's snake-eyes,"
4145,THE CHAIR,Up the black-bearded chimney leap;
4146,THE CHAIR,Then on my shoulder my dull head would drop.
4147,THE CHAIR,
4148,THE CHAIR,And half asleep
4149,THE CHAIR,I heard her creep--Her
4150,THE CHAIR,"never-singing lips shut fast,"
4151,THE CHAIR,Fearing to wake me by a careless breath.
4152,THE CHAIR,
4153,THE CHAIR,"Then, at last,"
4154,THE CHAIR,"My lids upcast,"
4155,THE CHAIR,"Our eyes met, I smiled and she smiled,"
4156,THE CHAIR,And I shut mine again and truly slept.
4157,THE CHAIR,
4158,THE CHAIR,Was I that child
4159,THE CHAIR,"Fretful, sick, wild?"
4160,THE CHAIR,Was that you moving soft and soft
4161,THE CHAIR,Between the rooms if I but played at sleep?
4162,THE CHAIR,
4163,THE CHAIR,"Or if I laughed,"
4164,THE CHAIR,"Talked, cried, or coughed,"
4165,THE CHAIR,"You smiled too, just perceptibly,"
4166,THE CHAIR,"Or your large kind brown eyes said, O poor boy!"
4167,THE CHAIR,
4168,THE CHAIR,From the fireside I
4169,THE CHAIR,Could see the narrow sky
4170,THE CHAIR,"Through the barred heavy window panes,"
4171,THE CHAIR,Could hear the sparrows quarrelling round the
4172,THE CHAIR,lilac;
4173,THE CHAIR,
4174,THE CHAIR,And hear the heavy rains
4175,THE CHAIR,Choking in the roof-drains:--
4176,THE CHAIR,Else of the world I nothing heard
4177,THE CHAIR,Or nothing remember now. But most I loved
4178,THE CHAIR,
4179,THE CHAIR,To watch when you stirred
4180,THE CHAIR,Busily like a bird
4181,THE CHAIR,At household doings; with hands floured
4182,THE CHAIR,Mixing a magic with your cakes and tarts.
4183,THE CHAIR,
4184,THE CHAIR,"O into me, sick, froward,"
4185,THE CHAIR,Yourself you poured;
4186,THE CHAIR,In all those days and weeks when I
4187,THE CHAIR,"Sat, slept, woke, whimpered, wondered and slept again."
4188,THE CHAIR,
4189,THE CHAIR,Now but a memory
4190,THE CHAIR,To bless and harry me
4191,THE CHAIR,Remains of you still swathed with care;
4192,THE CHAIR,"Myself your chief care, sitting by the hearth"
4193,THE CHAIR,
4194,THE CHAIR,"Propped in the pillowed chair,"
4195,THE CHAIR,"Following you with tired stare,"
4196,THE CHAIR,And my hand following the wood lines
4197,THE CHAIR,By dead hands smoothed and followed many years.

4206,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"In this wild dream-like snare of mortal shocks,"
4207,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,How look (I muse) those cold and solitary stars
4208,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"On these magnificent, cruel wars?--Venus,"
4209,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,that brushes with her shining lips
4210,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,(Surely!) the wakeful edge of the world and mocks
4211,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,With hers its all ungentle wantonness?--Or
4212,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,the large moon (pricked by the spars of ships
4213,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Creeping and creeping in their restlessness),"
4214,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The moon pouring strange light on things more strange,"
4215,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Looks she unheedfully on seas and lands
4216,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Trembling with change and fear of counter-change?
4217,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,
4218,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"O, not earth trembles, but the stars, the stars!"
4219,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,The sky is shaken and the cool air is quivering.
4220,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,I cannot look up to the crowded height
4221,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"And see the fair stars trembling in their light,"
4222,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,For thinking of the starlike spirits of men
4223,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Crowding the earth and with great passion quivering:--
4224,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Stars quenched in anger and hate, stars sick with pity."
4225,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,I cannot look up to the naked skies
4226,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Because a sorrow on dark midnight lies,"
4227,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Death, on the living world of sense;"
4228,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Because on my own land a shadow lies
4229,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,That may not rise;
4230,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Because from bare grey hillside and rich city
4231,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Streams of uncomprehending sadness pour,"
4232,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Thwarting the eager spirit's pure intelligence...
4233,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,How look (I muse) those cold and solitary stars
4234,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"On these magnificent, cruel wars?"
4235,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,
4236,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Stars trembled in broad heaven, faint with pity."
4237,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,An hour to dawn I looked. Beside the trees
4238,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Wet mist shaped other trees that branching rose,"
4239,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Covering the woods and putting out the stars.
4240,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"There was no murmur on the seas,"
4241,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,No wind blew--only the wandering air that grows
4242,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"With dawn, then murmurs, sighs,"
4243,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And dies.
4244,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The mist climbed slowly, putting out the stars,"
4245,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And the earth trembled when the stars were gone;
4246,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And moving strangely everywhere upon
4247,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The trembling earth, thickened the watery mist."
4248,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,
4249,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And for a time the holy things are veiled.
4250,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,England's wise thoughts are swords; her quiet hours
4251,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Are trodden underfoot like wayside flowers,"
4252,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And every English heart is England's wholly.
4253,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,In starless night
4254,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,A serious passion streams the heaven with light.
4255,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,A common beating is in the air--
4256,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,The heart of England throbbing everywhere.
4257,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"And all her roads are nerves of noble thought,"
4258,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And all her people's brain is but her brain;
4259,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"And all her history, less her shame,"
4260,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Is part of her requickened consciousness.
4261,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Her courage rises clean again.
4262,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,
4263,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Even in victory there hides defeat;
4264,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The spirit's murdered though the body survives,"
4265,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Except the cause for which a people strives
4266,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Burn with no covetous, foul heat."
4267,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Fights she against herself who infamously draws
4268,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The sword against man's secret spiritual laws,"
4269,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"But thou, England, because a bitter heel"
4270,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Hath sought to bruise the brain, the sensitive will,"
4271,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The conscience of the world,"
4272,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"For this, England, art risen, and shalt fight"
4273,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Purely through long profoundest night,"
4274,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,
4275,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Making their quarrel thine who are grieved like thee;
4276,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And (if to thee the stars yield victory)
4277,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Tempering their hate of the great foe that hurled
4278,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Vainly her strength against the conscience of the world.
4279,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,
4280,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"I looked again, or dreamed I looked, and saw"
4281,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,The stars again and all their peace again.
4282,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The moving mist had gone, and shining still"
4283,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,The moon went high and pale above the hill.
4284,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Not now those lights were trembling in the vast
4285,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Ways of the nervy heaven, nor trembled earth:"
4286,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Profound and calm they gazed as the soft-shod hours passed.
4287,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"And with less fear (not with less awe,"
4288,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Remembering, England, all the blood and pain)"
4289,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"How look, I cried, you stern and solitary stars"
4290,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,On these disastrous wars!

4933,THE BULL,
4934,THE BULL,"Not a leopard bright as flame,"
4935,THE BULL,"Flashing fingerhooks of steel,"
4936,THE BULL,"That a wooden tree might feel,"

4938,THE BULL,"For a second reprimand,"
4939,THE BULL,Not a leopard in the land.
4940,THE BULL,
4941,THE BULL,Not a lion of them all
4942,THE BULL,"Not a lion of the hills,"
4943,THE BULL,"Hero of a thousand kills,"

4953,THE BULL,Only in his tameless heart.
4954,THE BULL,
4955,THE BULL,Pity him that he must wake;
4956,THE BULL,Even now the swarm of flies

5015,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Yet, true enough, I heard them plain,"
5016,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"I heard them both again, again,"
5017,THE SONG OF HONOUR,As sharp and sweet and clear
5018,THE SONG OF HONOUR,As if the Abyssinian tree
5019,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Had thrust a bough across the sea,"
5020,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Had thrust a bough across to me
5021,THE SONG OF HONOUR,With music for my ear!
5022,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5023,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"I heard them both, and oh! I heard"
5024,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of every singing bird
5025,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"That sings beneath the sky,"
5026,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And with the song of lark and wren
5027,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The song of mountains, moths and men"
5028,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And seas and rainbows vie!
5029,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5030,THE SONG OF HONOUR,I heard the universal choir
5031,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The Sons of Light exalt their Sire
5032,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"With universal song,"
5033,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Earth's lowliest and loudest notes,"
5034,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Her million times ten million throats
5035,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Exalt Him loud and long,"
5036,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And lips and lungs and tongues of Grace
5037,THE SONG OF HONOUR,From every part and every place
5038,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Within the shining of His face
5039,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The universal throng.
5040,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5041,THE SONG OF HONOUR,I heard the hymn of being sound
5042,THE SONG OF HONOUR,From every well of honour found
5043,THE SONG OF HONOUR,In human sense and soul:
5044,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of poets when they write
5045,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The testament of Beautysprite
5046,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Upon a flying scroll,"
5047,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of painters when they take
5048,THE SONG OF HONOUR,A burning brush for Beauty's sake
5049,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And limn her features whole--
5050,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5051,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of men divinely wise
5052,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Who look and see in starry skies
5053,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Not stars so much as robins' eyes,"
5054,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And when these pale away
5055,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Hear flocks of shiny pleiades
5056,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Among the plums and apple trees
5057,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Sing in the summer day--
5058,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of all both high and low
5059,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"To some blest vision true,"
5060,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of beggars when they throw
5061,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The crust of pity all men owe
5062,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"To hungry sparrows in the snow,"
5063,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Old beggars hungry too--
5064,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of kings of kingdoms when
5065,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"They rise above their fortune men,"
5066,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And crown themselves anew,--"
5067,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5068,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The song of courage, heart and will"
5069,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And gladness in a fight,"
5070,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Of men who face a hopeless hill
5071,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"With sparking and delight,"
5072,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The bells and bells of song that ring
5073,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Round banners of a cause or king
5074,THE SONG OF HONOUR,From armies bleeding white--
5075,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5076,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The songs of sailors every one
5077,THE SONG OF HONOUR,When monstrous tide and tempest run
5078,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"At ships like bulls at red,"
5079,THE SONG OF HONOUR,When stately ships are twirled and spun
5080,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Like whipping-tops and help there's none
5081,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And mighty ships ten thousand ton
5082,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Go down like lumps of lead--
5083,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5084,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And songs of fighters stern as they
5085,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"At odds with fortune night and day,"
5086,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Crammed up in cities grim and grey
5087,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"As thick as bees in hives,"
5088,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Hosannas of a lowly throng
5089,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Who sing unconscious of their song,"
5090,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Whose lips are in their lives--
5091,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5092,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And song of some at holy war
5093,THE SONG OF HONOUR,With spells and ghouls more dread by far
5094,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Than deadly seas and cities are,"
5095,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Or hordes of quarrelling kings--
5096,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The song of fighters great and small,"
5097,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The song of pretty fighters all,"
5098,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And high heroic things--
5099,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5100,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of lovers--who knows how
5101,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Twitched up from place and time
5102,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Upon a sigh, a blush, a vow,"
5103,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"A curve or hue of cheek or brow,"
5104,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Borne up and off from here and now
5105,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Into the void sublime!
5106,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5107,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And crying loves and passions still
5108,THE SONG OF HONOUR,In every key from soft to shrill
5109,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And numbers never done,"
5110,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Dog-loyalties to faith and friend,"
5111,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And loves like Ruth's of old no end,"
5112,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And intermission none--
5113,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5114,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And burst on burst for beauty and
5115,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"For numbers not behind,"
5116,THE SONG OF HONOUR,From men whose love of motherland
5117,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Is like a dog's for one dear hand,"
5118,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Sole, selfless, boundless, blind--"
5119,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And song of some with hearts beside
5120,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"For men and sorrows far and wide,"
5121,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Who watch the world with pity and pride
5122,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And warm to all mankind--
5123,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5124,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And endless joyous music rise
5125,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"From children at their play,"
5126,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And endless soaring lullabies
5127,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"From happy, happy mother's eyes,"
5128,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And answering crows and baby cries,"
5129,THE SONG OF HONOUR,How many who shall say!
5130,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And many a song as wondrous well
5131,THE SONG OF HONOUR,With pangs and sweets intolerable
5132,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"From lonely hearths too gray to tell,"
5133,THE SONG OF HONOUR,God knows how utter gray!
5134,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5135,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And song from many a house of care
5136,THE SONG OF HONOUR,When pain has forced a footing there
5137,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And there's a Darkness on the stair
5138,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Will not be turned away--
5139,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5140,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And song--that song whose singers come
5141,THE SONG OF HONOUR,With old kind tales of pity from
5142,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The Great Compassion's lips,"
5143,THE SONG OF HONOUR,That makes the bells of Heaven to peal
5144,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Round pillows frosty with the feel
5145,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Of Death's cold finger tips--
5146,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5147,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The song of men all sorts and kinds,"
5148,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"As many tempers, moods and minds"
5149,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"As leaves are on a tree,"
5150,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"As many faiths and castes and creeds,"
5151,THE SONG OF HONOUR,As many human bloods and breeds
5152,THE SONG OF HONOUR,As in the world may be;
5153,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5154,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of each and all who gaze
5155,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"On Beauty in her naked blaze,"
5156,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Or see her dimly in a haze,"
5157,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Or get her light in fitful rays
5158,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And tiniest needles even,"
5159,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The song of all not wholly dark,"
5160,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Not wholly sunk in stupor stark
5161,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Too deep for groping Heaven--
5162,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5163,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And alleluias sweet and clear
5164,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And wild with beauty men mishear,"
5165,THE SONG OF HONOUR,From choirs of song as near and dear
5166,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"To Paradise as they,"
5167,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The everlasting pipe and flute
5168,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Of wind and sea and bird and brute,"
5169,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And lips deaf men imagine mute
5170,THE SONG OF HONOUR,In wood and stone and clay;
5171,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
5172,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The music of a lion strong
5173,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"That shakes a hill a whole night long,"
5174,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"A hill as loud as he,"
5175,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The twitter of a mouse among

5177,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The ruby's and the rainbow's song,"
5178,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The nightingale's--all three,"
5179,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of life that wells and flows
5180,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"From every leopard, lark and rose"
5181,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And everything that gleams or goes
5182,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Lack-lustre in the sea.
5183,THE SONG OF HONOUR,

5187,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Of everything that lives and loves
5188,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And upward, ever upward moves"
5189,THE SONG OF HONOUR,From lowly to sublime!
5190,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Earth's multitudinous Sons of Light,"
5191,THE SONG OF HONOUR,I heard them lift their lyric might
5192,THE SONG OF HONOUR,With each and every chanting sprite

5199,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And at the altar die,"
5200,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And in the awful quiet then
5201,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Myself I heard Amen, Amen,"
5202,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Amen I heard me cry!
5203,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"I heard it all, and then although"
5204,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"I caught my flying senses, oh,"
5205,THE SONG OF HONOUR,A dizzy man was I!
5206,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"I stood and stared; the sky was lit,"
5207,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The sky was stars all over it,"
5208,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"I stood, I knew not why,"
5209,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Without a wish, without a will,"
5210,THE SONG OF HONOUR,I stood upon that silent hill
5211,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And stared into the sky until
5212,THE SONG OF HONOUR,My eyes were blind with stars and still
5213,THE SONG OF HONOUR,I stared into the sky.

5461,THE NIGHT HUNT,"In the morning, in the dark,"
5462,THE NIGHT HUNT,"When the stars begin to blunt,"
5463,THE NIGHT HUNT,By the wall of Barn a Park
5464,THE NIGHT HUNT,Dogs I heard and saw them hunt;
5465,THE NIGHT HUNT,"All the parish dogs were there,"
5466,THE NIGHT HUNT,"All the dogs for miles around,"
5467,THE NIGHT HUNT,"Teeming up behind a hare,"
5468,THE NIGHT HUNT,"In the dark, without a sound."
5469,THE NIGHT HUNT,
5470,THE NIGHT HUNT,How I heard I scarce can tell--
5471,THE NIGHT HUNT,'Twas a patter in the grass--
5472,THE NIGHT HUNT,And I did not see them well
5473,THE NIGHT HUNT,Come across the dark and pass;
5474,THE NIGHT HUNT,Yet I saw them and I knew
5475,THE NIGHT HUNT,Spearman's dog and Spellman's dog
5476,THE NIGHT HUNT,"And, beside my own dog too,"
5477,THE NIGHT HUNT,Leamy's from the Island Bog.
5478,THE NIGHT HUNT,
5479,THE NIGHT HUNT,In the morning when the sun
5480,THE NIGHT HUNT,"Burnished all the green to gorse,"
5481,THE NIGHT HUNT,I went out to take a run
5482,THE NIGHT HUNT,Round the bog upon my horse;
5483,THE NIGHT HUNT,And my dog that had been sleeping
5484,THE NIGHT HUNT,In the heat beside the door
5485,THE NIGHT HUNT,Left his yawning and went leaping
5486,THE NIGHT HUNT,On a hundred yards before.
5487,THE NIGHT HUNT,
5488,THE NIGHT HUNT,Through the village street we passed--
5489,THE NIGHT HUNT,Not a dog there raised a snout--
5490,THE NIGHT HUNT,Through the street and out at last
5491,THE NIGHT HUNT,On the white bog road and out
5492,THE NIGHT HUNT,"Over Barna Park full pace,"
5493,THE NIGHT HUNT,"Over to the silver stream,"
5494,THE NIGHT HUNT,"Horse and dog in happy race,"
5495,THE NIGHT HUNT,Rider between thought and dream.
5496,THE NIGHT HUNT,
5497,THE NIGHT HUNT,"By the stream, at Leamy's house,"
5498,THE NIGHT HUNT,Lay a dog--my pace I curbed--
5499,THE NIGHT HUNT,But our coming did not rouse
5500,THE NIGHT HUNT,Him from drowsing undisturbed;
5501,THE NIGHT HUNT,"And my dog, as unaware"
5502,THE NIGHT HUNT,"Of the other, dropped beside"
5503,THE NIGHT HUNT,And went running by me there
5504,THE NIGHT HUNT,With my horse's slackened stride.
5505,THE NIGHT HUNT,
5506,THE NIGHT HUNT,"Yet by something, by a twitch"
5507,THE NIGHT HUNT,"Of the sleeper's eye, a look"
5508,THE NIGHT HUNT,"From the runner, something which"
5509,THE NIGHT HUNT,"Little chords of feeling shook,"
5510,THE NIGHT HUNT,I was conscious that a thought
5511,THE NIGHT HUNT,Shuddered through the silent deep
5512,THE NIGHT HUNT,Of a secret--I had caught
5513,THE NIGHT HUNT,Something I had known in sleep.

5597,I,
5598,I,How many times I nearly miss the train
5599,I,By running up the staircase once again
5600,I,For some dear trifle almost left behind.
5601,I,At that last moment the unwary mind
5602,I,Forgets the solemn tick of station-time;
5603,I,That muddy lane the feet must climb--
5604,I,The bridge--the ticket--signal down--
5605,I,Train just emerging beyond the town:
5606,I,The great blue engine panting as it takes
5607,I,"The final curve, and grinding on its brakes"
5608,I,Up to the platform-edge... The little doors
5609,I,"Swing open, while the burly porter roars."
5610,I,The tight compartment fills: our careful eyes
5611,I,Go to explore each other's destinies.
5612,I,A lull. The station-master waves. The train
5613,I,"Gathers, and grips, and takes the rails again,"
5614,I,"Moves to the shining open land, and soon"
5615,I,Begins to tittle-tattle a tame tattoon.

5617,I,
5618,II,II
5619,II,
5620,II,"They ramble through the country-side,"
5621,II,"Dear gentle monsters, and we ride"
5622,II,Pleasantly seated--so we sink
5623,II,Into a torpor on the brink
5624,II,"Of thought, or read our books, and understand"
5625,II,Half them and half the backward-gliding land:
5626,II,(Trees in a dance all twirling round;
5627,II,Large rivers flowing with no sound;
5628,II,"The scattered images of town and field,"
5629,II,Shining flowers half concealed.)
5630,II,"And, having settled to an equal rate,"
5631,II,"They swing the curve and straighten to the straight,"
5632,II,"Curtail their stride and gather up their joints,"
5633,II,"Snort, dwindle their steam for the noisy points,"
5634,II,"Leap them in safety, and, the other side,"
5635,II,Loop again to an even stride.
5636,II,
5637,II,The long train moves: we move in it along.
5638,II,"Like an old ballad, or an endless song,"
5639,II,It drones and wimbles its unwearied croon--
5640,II,"Croons, drones, and mumbles all the afternoon."
5641,II,
5642,II,"Towns with their fifty chimneys close and high,"
5643,II,"Wreathed in great smoke between the earth and sky,"
5644,II,"It hurtles through them, and you think it must"
5645,II,"Halt--but it shrieks and sputters them with dust,"
5646,II,"Cracks like a bullet through their big affairs,"
5647,II,"Rushes the station-bridge, and disappears"
5648,II,"Out to the suburb, laying bare"
5649,II,Each garden trimmed with pitiful care;
5650,II,"Children are caught at idle play,"
5651,II,"Held a moment, and thrown away."
5652,II,Nearly everyone looks round.
5653,II,Some dignified inhabitant is found
5654,II,Right in the middle of the commonplace--
5655,II,"Buttoning his trousers, or washing his face."

5659,III,
5660,III,Oh the wild engine! Every time I sit
5661,III,In any train I must remember it.
5662,III,The way it smashes through the air; its great
5663,III,Petulant majesty and terrible rate:
5664,III,"Driving the ground before it, with those round"
5665,III,"Feet pounding, eating, covering the ground;"
5666,III,The piston using up the white steam so
5667,III,You cannot watch it when it come or go;
5668,III,"The cutting, the embankment; how it takes"
5669,III,"The tunnels, and the clatter that it makes;"
5670,III,"So careful of the train and of the track,"
5671,III,"Guiding us out, or helping us go back;"
5672,III,Breasting its destination: at the close
5673,III,"Yawning, and slowly dropping to a doze."

5679,IV,"This journey long, and trundled with the train,"
5680,IV,"Now to our separate purposes must rise,"
5681,IV,Becoming decent strangers once again.
5682,IV,The little chamber we have made our home
5683,IV,"In which we so conveniently abode,"
5684,IV,"The complicated journey we have come,"
5685,IV,Must be an unremembered episode.
5686,IV,Our common purpose made us all like friends.
5687,IV,How suddenly it ends!
5688,IV,"A nod, a murmur, or a little smile,"
5689,IV,"Or often nothing, and away we file."
5690,IV,"I hate to leave you, comrades. I will stay"
5691,IV,To watch you drift apart and pass away.
5692,IV,It seems impossible to go and meet
5693,IV,All those strange eyes of people in the street.
5694,IV,"But, like some proud unconscious god, the train"
5695,IV,Gathers us up and scatters us again.

5865,276 B.C.,"Clusters like odes for victors in the games,"
5866,276 B.C.,"Strophe on strophe globed, pure nectar all!"
5867,276 B.C.,"Spread such to dry,--if Helios grant thee grace,"
5868,276 B.C.,Exposed unto his flames
5869,276 B.C.,"Two days, or, if not, three; or, should rain fall;"
5870,276 B.C.,Stretch them on hurdles in the house four days.
5871,276 B.C.,
5872,276 B.C.,"Grapes are not sharded chestnuts, which the tree"
5873,276 B.C.,"Lets fall to burst them on the ground, where red"
5874,276 B.C.,"Rolls forth the fruit, from white-lined wards set free,"
5875,276 B.C.,And all undamaged glows 'mid husks it shed;
5876,276 B.C.,"Nay, they are soft and should be singly stripped"
5877,276 B.C.,"From off the bunch, by maiden's dainty hand,"
5878,276 B.C.,Then dropped through the cool silent depth to sink
5879,276 B.C.,"(Coy, as herself hath slipped,"
5880,276 B.C.,"Bathing, from shelves in caves along the strand)"
5881,276 B.C.,
5882,276 B.C.,Till round each dark grape water barely wink;
5883,276 B.C.,Since some nine measures of sea-water fill
5884,276 B.C.,"A butt of fifty, ere the plump fruit peep,"
5885,276 B.C.,"--Like sombre dolphin shoals when nights are still,"
5886,276 B.C.,"Which penned in Proteus' wizard circle sleep,"
5887,276 B.C.,And 'twixt them glinting curves of silver glance
5888,276 B.C.,"If Zephyr, dimpling dark calm, counts them o'er.--"
5889,276 B.C.,"Let soak thy fruit for two days thus, then tread!"
5890,276 B.C.,"While bare-legged bumpkins dance,"
5891,276 B.C.,"Bright from thy bursting press arched spouts shall pour,"
5892,276 B.C.,And gurgling torrents towards thy vats run red.
5893,276 B.C.,
5894,276 B.C.,"Meanwhile the maidens, each with wooden rake,"
5895,276 B.C.,Drag back the skins and laugh at aprons splashed;
5896,276 B.C.,"Or youths rest, boasting how their brown arms ache,"
5897,276 B.C.,"So fast their shovels for so long have flashed,"
5898,276 B.C.,Baffling their comrades' legs with mounting heaps.
5899,276 B.C.,"Treble their labour! still the happier they,"
5900,276 B.C.,"Who at this genial task wear out long hours,"
5901,276 B.C.,"Till vast night round them creeps,"
5902,276 B.C.,When soon the torch-light dance whirls them away;
5903,276 B.C.,For gods who love wine double all their powers.
5904,276 B.C.,Iacchus is the always grateful god!
5905,276 B.C.,His vineyards are more fair than gardens far;
5906,276 B.C.,"Hanging, like those of Babylon, they nod"
5907,276 B.C.,O'er each Ionian cliff and hill-side scar!
5908,276 B.C.,"While Cypris lends him saltness, depth, and peace;"
5909,276 B.C.,The brown earth yields him sap for richest green;
5910,276 B.C.,And he has borrowed laughter from the sky;
5911,276 B.C.,Wildness from winds; and bees
5912,276 B.C.,Bring honey.--Then choose casks which thou hast seen
5913,276 B.C.,"Are leakless, very wholesome, and quite dry!"
5914,276 B.C.,
5915,276 B.C.,"That Coan wine the very finest is,"
5916,276 B.C.,"I do assure thee, who have travelled much"
5917,276 B.C.,And learned to judge of diverse vintages.
5918,276 B.C.,Faint not before the toil! this wine is such
5919,276 B.C.,As tempteth princes launch long pirate barks;--From
5920,276 B.C.,"which may Zeus protect Sicilian bays,"
5921,276 B.C.,"And, ere long, me safe home from Egypt bring,"
5922,276 B.C.,Letting no black-sailed sharks
5923,276 B.C.,"Scent this king's gifts, for whom I sweeten praise"
5924,276 B.C.,With those same songs thou didst to Chloe sing!
5925,276 B.C.,
5926,276 B.C.,"I wrote them 'neath the vine-cloaked elm, for thee."
5927,276 B.C.,Recall those nights! our couches were a load
5928,276 B.C.,"Of scented lentisk; upward, tree by tree,"
5929,276 B.C.,"Thy father's orchard sloped, and past us flowed"
5930,276 B.C.,"A stream sluiced for his vineyards; when, above,"
5931,276 B.C.,"The apples fell, they on to us were rolled,"
5932,276 B.C.,"But kept us not awake.--O Laco, own"
5933,276 B.C.,How thou didst rave of love!
5934,276 B.C.,"Now art thou staid, thy son is three years old;"
5935,276 B.C.,"But I, who made thee love-songs, live alone."
5936,276 B.C.,
5937,276 B.C.,Muse thou at dawn o'er thy yet slumbering wife!--
5938,276 B.C.,"Not chary of her best was nature there,"
5939,276 B.C.,"Who, though a third of her full gift of life"
5940,276 B.C.,"Was spent, still added beauties still more rare;"
5941,276 B.C.,"What calm slow days, what holy sleep at night,"
5942,276 B.C.,Evolved her for long twilight trystings fraught
5943,276 B.C.,With panic blushes and tip-toe surmise:
5944,276 B.C.,"And then, what mystic might--"
5945,276 B.C.,"All, with a crowning boon, through travail brought!"
5946,276 B.C.,Consider this and give thy best likewise!
5947,276 B.C.,
5948,276 B.C.,"Ungrateful be not! Laco, ne'er be that!"
5949,276 B.C.,Well worth thy while to make such wine 'twould be;
5950,276 B.C.,"I see thy red face 'neath thy broad straw hat,"
5951,276 B.C.,"I see thy house, thy vineyards, Sicily!--"
5952,276 B.C.,"Thou dost demur, good but too easy friend!"
5953,276 B.C.,"Come, put those doubts away! thou hast strong lads,"
5954,276 B.C.,Brave wenches; on the steep beach lolls thy ship
5955,276 B.C.,"Where vine-clad slopes descend,"
5956,276 B.C.,"Sheltering our bay, that headlong rillet glads,"
5957,276 B.C.,Like a stripped child fain in the sea to dip.

5969,A SPANISH PICTURE,
5970,A SPANISH PICTURE,"On a trestle-table laid, Don Juan,"
5971,A SPANISH PICTURE,"A half-mask near thine ear,"
5972,A SPANISH PICTURE,A visor black in which void gape two gaps
5973,A SPANISH PICTURE,Where through thou oft didst leer.
5974,A SPANISH PICTURE,
5975,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Thou waitest for the priests, Don Juan,"
5976,A SPANISH PICTURE,To bear thee to thy grave;
5977,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Thou'rt theirs at length beyond all doubt, but ha!"
5978,A SPANISH PICTURE,Hast now no soul to save.
5979,A SPANISH PICTURE,
5980,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Thou wast brought home last night, Don Juan,"
5981,A SPANISH PICTURE,Upon a stable door;
5982,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Beneath a young nun's casement, found dropped dead,"
5983,A SPANISH PICTURE,Where thou hadst wooed of yore:
5984,A SPANISH PICTURE,
5985,A SPANISH PICTURE,"To pay their trouble then, Don Juan,"
5986,A SPANISH PICTURE,Those base grooms took thy sword;
5987,A SPANISH PICTURE,"A rapier to fetch gold, with shagreened sheath,"
5988,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Wrought hand-grip, and silk cord;"
5989,A SPANISH PICTURE,
5990,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Which, with thy fame enhanced, Don Juan,"
5991,A SPANISH PICTURE,Were worth hidalgo's rent;
5992,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Yet on which now, at most, some few moidore"

5995,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Dull brown a cloak enwraps, Don Juan,"
5996,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Both thy lean shanks, one arm,"
5997,A SPANISH PICTURE,"That old bird-cage thy breast, where like magpie"
5998,A SPANISH PICTURE,Thy heart hopped on alarm.
5999,A SPANISH PICTURE,
6000,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Yet out beyond thy cloak, Don Juan,"
6001,A SPANISH PICTURE,Thrust prim white-stocking'd feet--Silk-stocking'd
6002,A SPANISH PICTURE,feet that in quadrille pranced round--
6003,A SPANISH PICTURE,Slippers high-heeled and neat;
6004,A SPANISH PICTURE,
6005,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Thy silver-buckled shoes, Don Juan,"
6006,A SPANISH PICTURE,"No more shall tread a floor,"
6007,A SPANISH PICTURE,Beside their heels upon the board lies now
6008,A SPANISH PICTURE,A half-peeled onion's core:
6009,A SPANISH PICTURE,
6010,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Munching, a crone, that knew, Don Juan,"
6011,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Thy best contrived plots,"
6012,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Hobbles about the room, whose gaunt stone walls"
6013,A SPANISH PICTURE,Drear echo as she trots;
6014,A SPANISH PICTURE,
6015,A SPANISH PICTURE,"She makes her bundle up, Don Juan;"
6016,A SPANISH PICTURE,"She'll not forget thy rings,"
6017,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Thy buckles, nor silk stockings; nay, not she!"
6018,A SPANISH PICTURE,They'll go with her few things.
6019,A SPANISH PICTURE,
6020,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Those lids she hath pulled down, Don Juan,"
6021,A SPANISH PICTURE,That lowered ne'er for shame;
6022,A SPANISH PICTURE,"No spark from beauty more in thy brain pan,"
6023,A SPANISH PICTURE,Shall make its tinder flame:
6024,A SPANISH PICTURE,
6025,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Thou hast enjoyed all that, Don Juan,"
6026,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Which good resolves doth daunt,"
6027,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Which hypocrites doth tempt to stake vile souls,"
6028,A SPANISH PICTURE,Which cowards crave and want;
6029,A SPANISH PICTURE,
6030,A SPANISH PICTURE,"Thou wast an envied man, Don Juan,"
6031,A SPANISH PICTURE,Long shalt be envied still;

6069,THE GAZELLES,"When the sheen on tall summer grass is pale,"
6070,THE GAZELLES,Across blue skies white clouds float on
6071,THE GAZELLES,"In shoals, or disperse and singly sail,"
6072,THE GAZELLES,"Till, the sun being set, they all are gone:"
6073,THE GAZELLES,
6074,THE GAZELLES,"Yet, as long as they may shine bright in the sun,"
6075,THE GAZELLES,"They flock or stray through the daylight bland,"
6076,THE GAZELLES,While their stealthy shadows like foxes run
6077,THE GAZELLES,Beneath where the grass is dry and tanned:
6078,THE GAZELLES,
6079,THE GAZELLES,"And the waste, in hills that swell and fall,"
6080,THE GAZELLES,Goes heaving into yet dreamier haze;
6081,THE GAZELLES,And a wonder of silence is over all
6082,THE GAZELLES,Where the eye feeds long like a lover's gaze:
6083,THE GAZELLES,
6084,THE GAZELLES,"Then, cleaving the grass, gazelles appear"
6085,THE GAZELLES,(The gentler dolphins of kindlier waves)
6086,THE GAZELLES,With sensitive heads alert of ear;
6087,THE GAZELLES,"Frail crowds that a delicate hearing saves,"
6088,THE GAZELLES,
6089,THE GAZELLES,"That rely on the nostrils' keenest power,"
6090,THE GAZELLES,And are governed from trance-like distances
6091,THE GAZELLES,"By hopes and fears, and, hour by hour,"
6092,THE GAZELLES,"Sagacious of safety, snuff the breeze."
6093,THE GAZELLES,
6094,THE GAZELLES,"They keep together, the timid hearts;"
6095,THE GAZELLES,And each one's fear with a panic thrill
6096,THE GAZELLES,Is passed to an hundred; and if one starts
6097,THE GAZELLES,In three seconds all are over the hill.
6098,THE GAZELLES,
6099,THE GAZELLES,"A Nimrod might watch, in his hall's wan space,"
6100,THE GAZELLES,"After the feast, on the moonlit floor,"
6101,THE GAZELLES,"The timorous mice that troop and race,"
6102,THE GAZELLES,As tranced o'er those herds the sun doth pour;
6103,THE GAZELLES,
6104,THE GAZELLES,Like a wearied tyrant sated with food
6105,THE GAZELLES,Who envies each tiniest thief that steals
6106,THE GAZELLES,"Its hour from his abstracted mood,"
6107,THE GAZELLES,For it living zest and beauty reveals.
6108,THE GAZELLES,
6109,THE GAZELLES,"He alone, save the quite dispassionate moon,"
6110,THE GAZELLES,Sees them; she stares at the prowling pard
6111,THE GAZELLES,"Who surprises their sleep and, ah! how soon"

6118,THE GAZELLES,
6119,THE GAZELLES,"The race is as long as recorded time,"
6120,THE GAZELLES,Yet brief as the flash of assassin's knife;
6121,THE GAZELLES,For 'tis crammed as history is with crime
6122,THE GAZELLES,'Twixt the throbs at taking and losing life;
6123,THE GAZELLES,
6124,THE GAZELLES,"Then the warm wet clutch on the nape of the neck,"
6125,THE GAZELLES,Through which the keen incisors drive;
6126,THE GAZELLES,"Then the fleet knees give, down drops the wreck"
6127,THE GAZELLES,Of yesterday's pet that was so alive.
6128,THE GAZELLES,
6129,THE GAZELLES,"Yet the moon is naught concerned, ah no!"
6130,THE GAZELLES,She shines as on a drifting plank
6131,THE GAZELLES,Far in some northern sea-stream's flow
6132,THE GAZELLES,From which two numbed hands loosened and sank.
6133,THE GAZELLES,
6134,THE GAZELLES,Such thinning their number must suffer; and worse
6135,THE GAZELLES,"When hither at times the Shah's children roam,"
6136,THE GAZELLES,Their infant listlessness to immerse
6137,THE GAZELLES,In energy's ancient upland home:
6138,THE GAZELLES,
6139,THE GAZELLES,For here the shepherd in years of old
6140,THE GAZELLES,"Was taught by the stars, and bred a race"
6141,THE GAZELLES,That welling forth from these highlands rolled
6142,THE GAZELLES,In tides of conquest o'er earth's face:
6143,THE GAZELLES,
6144,THE GAZELLES,"On piebald ponies or else milk-white,"
6145,THE GAZELLES,"Here, with green bridles in silver bound,"
6146,THE GAZELLES,A crescent moon on the violet night
6147,THE GAZELLES,"Of their saddle cloths, or a sun rayed round,--"
6148,THE GAZELLES,
6149,THE GAZELLES,"With tiny bells on their harness ringing,"
6150,THE GAZELLES,"And voices that laugh and are shrill by starts,"
6151,THE GAZELLES,"Prancing, curvetting, and with them bringing"
6152,THE GAZELLES,"Swift chetahs cooped up in light-wheeled carts,"
6153,THE GAZELLES,
6154,THE GAZELLES,"They come, and their dainty pavilions pitch"
6155,THE GAZELLES,"In some valley, beside a sinuous pool,"
6156,THE GAZELLES,Where a grove of cedars towers in which
6157,THE GAZELLES,"Herons have built, where the shade is cool;"
6158,THE GAZELLES,
6159,THE GAZELLES,"Where they tether their ponies to low hung boughs,"
6160,THE GAZELLES,"Where long through the night their red fires gleam,"
6161,THE GAZELLES,Where the morning's stir doth them arouse
6162,THE GAZELLES,"To their bath in the lake, as from dreams to a dream."
6163,THE GAZELLES,
6164,THE GAZELLES,"And thence in an hour their hunt rides forth,"
6165,THE GAZELLES,And the chetahs course the shy gazelle
6166,THE GAZELLES,"To the east or west or south or north,"
6167,THE GAZELLES,And every eve in a distant vale
6168,THE GAZELLES,
6169,THE GAZELLES,A hetacomb of the slaughtered beasts
6170,THE GAZELLES,Is piled; tongues loll from breathless throats;
6171,THE GAZELLES,Round large jet eyes the horsefly feasts--
6172,THE GAZELLES,"Jet eyes, which now a blue film coats:"
6173,THE GAZELLES,
6174,THE GAZELLES,"Dead there they bleed, and each prince there"
6175,THE GAZELLES,"Is met by his sister, wife, or bride--"
6176,THE GAZELLES,"Delicious ladies with long dark hair,"
6177,THE GAZELLES,"And soft dark eyes, and brows arched wide,"
6178,THE GAZELLES,
6179,THE GAZELLES,"In quilted jacket, embroidered sash,"
6180,THE GAZELLES,And tent-like skirts of pleated lawn;
6181,THE GAZELLES,While their silk-lined jewelled slippers flash
6182,THE GAZELLES,Round bare feet bedded like pools at dawn:
6183,THE GAZELLES,
6184,THE GAZELLES,"So choicefully prepared to please,"
6185,THE GAZELLES,"Young, female, royal of race and mood,"
6186,THE GAZELLES,In indolent compassion these
6187,THE GAZELLES,O'er those dead beauteous creatures brood:
6188,THE GAZELLES,
6189,THE GAZELLES,"They lean some minutes against their friend,"
6190,THE GAZELLES,"A lad not slow to praise himself,"
6191,THE GAZELLES,Who tells how this one met his end
6192,THE GAZELLES,"Out-raced, or trapped by leopard stealth,"
6193,THE GAZELLES,
6194,THE GAZELLES,And boasts his chetahs fleetest are;
6195,THE GAZELLES,"Through his advice the chance occurred,"
6196,THE GAZELLES,That leeward vale by which the car
6197,THE GAZELLES,Was well brought round to head the herd.
6198,THE GAZELLES,
6199,THE GAZELLES,"Seeing him bronzed by sun and wind,"
6200,THE GAZELLES,"She feels his power and owns him lord,"
6201,THE GAZELLES,"Then, that his courage may please her mind,"
6202,THE GAZELLES,"With a soft coy hand half draws his sword,"
6203,THE GAZELLES,
6204,THE GAZELLES,"Just shudders to see the cold steel gleam,"
6205,THE GAZELLES,And drops it back in the long curved sheath;
6206,THE GAZELLES,She will make his evening meal a dream
6207,THE GAZELLES,And surround his sleep like some rich wreath
6208,THE GAZELLES,
6209,THE GAZELLES,Of heavy-lidded flowers bewitched
6210,THE GAZELLES,To speak soft words of ecstasy
6211,THE GAZELLES,"To wizard king old, wise, and enriched"
6212,THE GAZELLES,With all save youth's and love's sweet glee.
6213,THE GAZELLES,
6214,THE GAZELLES,"But, while they sleep, the orphaned herd"
6215,THE GAZELLES,"And wounded stragglers, through the night"
6216,THE GAZELLES,"Wander in pain, and wail unheard"
6217,THE GAZELLES,To the moon and the stars so cruelly bright:
6218,THE GAZELLES,
6219,THE GAZELLES,Why are they born? ah! why beget
6220,THE GAZELLES,They in the long November gloom
6221,THE GAZELLES,"Heirs of their beauty, their fleetness,--yet"
6222,THE GAZELLES,"Heirs of their panics, their pangs, their doom?"
6223,THE GAZELLES,
6224,THE GAZELLES,That to princely spouses children are born
6225,THE GAZELLES,"To be daintily bred and taught to please,"
6226,THE GAZELLES,Has a fitness like the return of morn:
6227,THE GAZELLES,But why perpetuate lives like these?
6228,THE GAZELLES,
6229,THE GAZELLES,"Why, with horns that jar and with fiery eyes,"
6230,THE GAZELLES,Should the male stags fight for the shuddering does
6231,THE GAZELLES,"Through the drear dark nights, with frequent cries"
6232,THE GAZELLES,From tyrant lust or outlawed woes?
6233,THE GAZELLES,
6234,THE GAZELLES,Doth the meaningless beauty of their lives
6235,THE GAZELLES,"Rave in the spring, when they course afar"
6236,THE GAZELLES,"Like the shadows of birds, and the young fawn strives"
6237,THE GAZELLES,Till its parents no longer the fleetest are?
6238,THE GAZELLES,
6239,THE GAZELLES,Like the shadows of flames which the sun's rays throw
6240,THE GAZELLES,"On a kiln's blank wall, where glaziers dwell,"
6241,THE GAZELLES,"Pale shadows as those from glasses they blow,"
6242,THE GAZELLES,"Yet that lap at the blank wall and rebel,--"
6243,THE GAZELLES,
6244,THE GAZELLES,Even so to my curious trance-like thought
6245,THE GAZELLES,"Those herds move over those pallid hills,"
6246,THE GAZELLES,With fever as of a frail life caught
6247,THE GAZELLES,In circumstance o'er-charged with ills;
6248,THE GAZELLES,
6249,THE GAZELLES,"More like the shadow of lives than life,"

6251,THE GAZELLES,"From baffled purpose and foredoomed strife,"
6252,THE GAZELLES,That in each man's heart must be hidden from scorn
6253,THE GAZELLES,
6254,THE GAZELLES,Yet with something of beauty very rare
6255,THE GAZELLES,"Unseizable, fugitive, half discerned;"
6256,THE GAZELLES,The trace of intentions that might have been fair
6257,THE GAZELLES,"In action, left on a face that yearned"
6258,THE GAZELLES,
6259,THE GAZELLES,"But long has ceased to yearn, alas!"
6260,THE GAZELLES,So faint a trace do they leave on the slopes
6261,THE GAZELLES,Of hills as sleek as their coats with grass;
6262,THE GAZELLES,So faint may the trace be of noblest hopes.
6263,THE GAZELLES,
6264,THE GAZELLES,Yet why are they born to roam and die?
6265,THE GAZELLES,"Can their beauty answer thy query, O soul?"
6266,THE GAZELLES,"Nay, nor that of hopes which were born to fly,"
6267,THE GAZELLES,But whose pinions the common and coarse day stole.
6268,THE GAZELLES,
6269,THE GAZELLES,"Like that region of grassy hills outspread,"
6270,THE GAZELLES,A realm of our thoughts knows days and nights
6271,THE GAZELLES,"And summers and winters, and has fed"
6272,THE GAZELLES,Ineffectual herds of vanished delights.

6358,THE TOWER,"It was deep night, and over Jerusalem's low roofs"
6359,THE TOWER,"The moon floated, drifting through high vaporous woofs."
6360,THE TOWER,"The moonlight crept and glistened silent, solemn, sweet,"
6361,THE TOWER,"Over dome and column, up empty, endless street;"
6362,THE TOWER,"In the closed, scented gardens the rose loosed from the stem"
6363,THE TOWER,Her white showery petals; none regarded them;
6364,THE TOWER,The starry thicket breathed odours to the sentinel palm;
6365,THE TOWER,Silence possessed the city like a soul possessed by calm.
6366,THE TOWER,
6367,THE TOWER,"Not a spark in the warren under the giant night,"
6368,THE TOWER,"Save where in a turret's lantern beamed a grave, still light:"
6369,THE TOWER,There in the topmost chamber a gold-eyed lamp was lit--
6370,THE TOWER,"Marvellous lamp in darkness, informing, redeeming it!"
6371,THE TOWER,"For, set in that tiny chamber, Jesus, the blessed and doomed,"
6372,THE TOWER,Spoke to the lone apostles as light to men entombed;
6373,THE TOWER,"And spreading His hands in blessing, as one soon to be dead,"
6374,THE TOWER,He put soft enchantment into spare wine and bread.
6375,THE TOWER,
6376,THE TOWER,"The hearts of the disciples were broken and full of tears,"
6377,THE TOWER,"Because their Lord, the spearless, was hedged about with spears;"
6378,THE TOWER,And in His face the sickness of departure had spread a gloom
6379,THE TOWER,At leaving His young friends friendless.
6380,THE TOWER,They could not forget the tomb.
6381,THE TOWER,"He smiled subduedly, telling, in tones soft as voice of the dove,"
6382,THE TOWER,"The endlessness of sorrow, the eternal solace of love;"
6383,THE TOWER,"And lifting the earthly tokens, wine and sorrowful bread,"
6384,THE TOWER,He bade them sup and remember One who lived and was dead.
6385,THE TOWER,And they could not restrain their weeping.
6386,THE TOWER,"But one rose up to depart,"
6387,THE TOWER,"Having weakness and hate of weakness raging within his heart,"
6388,THE TOWER,And bowed to the robed assembly whose eyes gleamed wet in the light.
6389,THE TOWER,Judas arose and departed; night went out to the night.
6390,THE TOWER,
6391,THE TOWER,"Then Jesus lifted His voice like a fountain in an ocean of tears,"
6392,THE TOWER,And comforted His disciples and calmed and allayed their fears.
6393,THE TOWER,"But Judas wound down the turret, creeping from floor to floor,"
6394,THE TOWER,"And would fly; but one leaning, weeping, barred him beside the door."
6395,THE TOWER,And he knew her by her ruddy garment and two yet-watching men:
6396,THE TOWER,"Mary of Seven Evils, Mary Magdalen."
6397,THE TOWER,And he was frighted at her. She sighed: 'I dreamed Him dead.
6398,THE TOWER,We sell the body for silver ...'
6399,THE TOWER,Then Judas cried out and fled
6400,THE TOWER,Forth into the night!... The moon had begun to set;
6401,THE TOWER,"A drear, deft wind went sifting, setting the dust afret,"
6402,THE TOWER,Into the heart of the city Judas ran on and prayed
6403,THE TOWER,To stern Jehovah lest his deed make him afraid.
6404,THE TOWER,"But in the tiny lantern, hanging as if on air,"
6405,THE TOWER,The disciples sat unspeaking. Amaze and peace were there.
6406,THE TOWER,"For _His_ voice, more lovely than song of all earthly birds,"
6407,THE TOWER,"In accents humble and happy spoke slow, consoling words."
6408,THE TOWER,
6409,THE TOWER,"Thus Jesus discoursed, and was silent, sitting upright, and soon"
6410,THE TOWER,Past the casement behind Him slanted the sinking moon;
6411,THE TOWER,"And, rising for Olivet, all stared, between love and dread,"
6412,THE TOWER,Seeing the torrid moon a ruddy halo behind His head.

6451,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"He lay, and those who watched him were amazed"
6452,THE SPRIG OF LIME,To see unheralded beneath the lids
6453,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Twin tears, new gathered at the price of pain,"
6454,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Start and at once run crookedly athwart
6455,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Cheeks channelled long by pain, never by tears."
6456,THE SPRIG OF LIME,So desolate too the sigh next uttered
6457,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"They had wept also, but his great lips moved,"
6458,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"And bending down one heard, '_A sprig of lime;"
6459,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Bring me a sprig of lime._' Whereat she stole
6460,THE SPRIG OF LIME,With dumb signs forth to pluck the thing he craved.
6461,THE SPRIG OF LIME,
6462,THE SPRIG OF LIME,So lay he till a lime-twig had been snapped
6463,THE SPRIG OF LIME,From some still branch that swept the outer grass
6464,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Far from the silver pillar of the hole
6465,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Which mounting past the house's crusted roof
6466,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Split into massy limbs, crossed boughs, a maze"
6467,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Of close-compacted intercontorted staffs
6468,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Bowered in foliage wherethrough the sun
6469,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Shot sudden showers of light or crystal spars
6470,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Or wavered in a green and vitreous flood.
6471,THE SPRIG OF LIME,
6472,THE SPRIG OF LIME,And all the while in faint and fainter tones
6473,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Scarce audible on deepened evening's hush
6474,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"He framed his curious and last request,"
6475,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"For '_lime, a sprig of lime._' Her trembling hand"
6476,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Closed his loose fingers on the awkward stem
6477,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Covered above with gentle heart-shaped leaves
6478,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"And under dangling, pale as honey-wax,"
6479,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Square clusters of sweet-scented starry flowers.
6480,THE SPRIG OF LIME,
6481,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"She laid his bent arm back upon his breast,"
6482,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Then watched above white knuckles clenched in prayer.
6483,THE SPRIG OF LIME,He never moved. Only at last his eyes
6484,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Opened, then brightened in such avid gaze"
6485,THE SPRIG OF LIME,She feared the coma mastered him again ...
6486,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"But no; strange sobs rose chuckling in his throat,"
6487,THE SPRIG OF LIME,A stranger ecstasy suffused the flesh
6488,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Of that just mask so sun-dried, gouged and old"
6489,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Which few--too few!--had loved, too many feared."
6490,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"'Father,' she cried; 'Father!'"
6491,THE SPRIG OF LIME,He did not hear.
6492,THE SPRIG OF LIME,
6493,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"She knelt and kneeling drank the scent of limes,"
6494,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Blown round the slow blind by a vesperal gust,"
6495,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Till the room swam. So the lime incense blew
6496,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Into her life as once it had in his,"
6497,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Though how and when and with what ageless charge
6498,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Of sorrow and deep joy how could she know?
6499,THE SPRIG OF LIME,
6500,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Sweet lime that often at the height of noon
6501,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Diffusing dizzy fragrance from your boughs,"
6502,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Tasselled with blossoms mere innumerable
6503,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Than the black bees, the uproar of whose toil"
6504,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Filled your green vaults, winning such metheglyn"
6505,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"As clouds their sappy cells, distil, as once"
6506,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Ye used, your sunniest emanations"
6507,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Toward the window where a woman kneels--She
6508,THE SPRIG OF LIME,who within that room in childish hours
6509,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Lay through the lasting murmur of blanch'd noon
6510,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Behind the sultry blind, now full now flat,"
6511,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Drinking anew of every odorous breath,"
6512,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Supremely happy in her ignorance
6513,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Of Time that hastens hourly and of Death
6514,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Who need not haste. Scatter your fumes, O lime,"
6515,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Loose from each hispid star of citron bloom,"
6516,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Tangled beneath the labyrinthine boughs,"
6517,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Cloud on such stinging cloud of exhalations
6518,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"As reek of youth, fierce life and summer's prime,"
6519,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Though hardly now shall he in that dusk room
6520,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Savour your sweetness, since the very sprig,"
6521,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Profuse of blossom and of essences,"
6522,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"He smells not, who in a paltering hand"
6523,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Clasps it laid close his peaked and gleaming face
6524,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Propped in the pillow. Breathe silent, lofty lime,"
6525,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Your curfew secrets out in fervid scent
6526,THE SPRIG OF LIME,To the attendant shadows! Tinge the air
6527,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Of the midsummer night that now begins,"
6528,THE SPRIG OF LIME,At an owl's oaring flight from dusk to dusk
6529,THE SPRIG OF LIME,And downward caper of the giddy bat
6530,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Hawking against the lustre of bare skies,"
6531,THE SPRIG OF LIME,With something of th' unfathomable bliss
6532,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"He, who lies dying there, knew once of old"
6533,THE SPRIG OF LIME,In the serene trance of a summer night
6534,THE SPRIG OF LIME,When with th' abundance of his young bride's hair
6535,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Loosed on his breast he lay and dared not sleep,"
6536,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Listening for the scarce motion of your boughs,"
6537,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Which sighed with bliss as she with blissful sleep,"
6538,THE SPRIG OF LIME,And drinking desperately each honied wave
6539,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Of perfume wafted past the ghostly blind
6540,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Knew first th' implacable and bitter sense
6541,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Of Time that hastes and Death who need not haste.
6542,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Shed your last sweetness, limes!"
6543,THE SPRIG OF LIME,But now no more.
6544,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"She, fruit of that night's love, she heeds you not,"
6545,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Who bent, compassionate, to the dim floor"
6546,THE SPRIG OF LIME,Takes up the sprig of lime and presses it
6547,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"In pain against the stumbling of her heart,"
6548,THE SPRIG OF LIME,"Knowing, untold, he cannot need it now."

6599,STRANGE MEETING,"And by his smile, I knew that sullen hall."

6675,'IN THE PINK',So Davies wrote: 'This leaves me in the pink.
6676,'IN THE PINK',"Then scrawled his name: 'Your loving sweet-heart, Willie'"
6677,'IN THE PINK',With crosses for a hug. He'd had a drink
6678,'IN THE PINK',"Of rum and tea; and, though the barn was chilly,"
6679,'IN THE PINK',For once his blood ran warm; he had pay to spend.
6680,'IN THE PINK',Winter was passing; soon the year would mend.
6681,'IN THE PINK',
6682,'IN THE PINK',He couldn't sleep that night. Stiff in the dark
6683,'IN THE PINK',"He groaned and thought of Sundays at the farm,"
6684,'IN THE PINK',When he'd go out as cheerful as a lark
6685,'IN THE PINK',In his best suit to wander arm-in-arm
6686,'IN THE PINK',"With brown-eyed Gwen, and whisper in her ear"
6687,'IN THE PINK',The simple silly things she liked to hear.
6688,'IN THE PINK',
6689,'IN THE PINK',And then he thought: to-morrow night we trudge
6690,'IN THE PINK',"Up to the trenches, and my boots are rotten."
6691,'IN THE PINK',"Five miles of stodgy clay and freezing sludge,"
6692,'IN THE PINK',And everything but wretchedness forgotten.

6700,THE DEATH-BED,
6701,THE DEATH-BED,
6702,THE DEATH-BED,He drowsed and was aware of silence heaped
6703,THE DEATH-BED,"Round him, unshaken as the steadfast walls;"
6704,THE DEATH-BED,"Aqueous-like floating rays of amber light,"
6705,THE DEATH-BED,"Soaring and quivering in the wings of sleep,--"
6706,THE DEATH-BED,Silence and safety; and his mortal shore
6707,THE DEATH-BED,"Lipped by the inward, moonless waves of death."
6708,THE DEATH-BED,
6709,THE DEATH-BED,"Some one was holding water to his mouth,"
6710,THE DEATH-BED,"He swallowed, unresisting; moaned and dropped"
6711,THE DEATH-BED,Through crimson gloom to darkness; and forgot
6712,THE DEATH-BED,The opiate throb and ache that was his wound.
6713,THE DEATH-BED,"Water--calm, sliding green above the weir;"
6714,THE DEATH-BED,"Water--a sky-lit alley for his boat,"
6715,THE DEATH-BED,"Bird-voiced, and bordered with reflected flowers"
6716,THE DEATH-BED,"And shaken hues of summer: drifting down,"
6717,THE DEATH-BED,"He dipped contented oars, and sighed, and slept."
6718,THE DEATH-BED,
6719,THE DEATH-BED,"Night, with a gust of wind, was in the ward,"
6720,THE DEATH-BED,Blowing the curtain to a glimmering curve.
6721,THE DEATH-BED,Night. He was blind; he could not see the stars
6722,THE DEATH-BED,Glinting among the wraiths of wandering cloud;
6723,THE DEATH-BED,"Queer blots of colour, purple, scarlet, green,"
6724,THE DEATH-BED,Flickered and faded in his drowning eyes.
6725,THE DEATH-BED,
6726,THE DEATH-BED,Rain; he could hear it rustling through the dark
6727,THE DEATH-BED,Fragrance and passionless music woven as one;
6728,THE DEATH-BED,Warm rain on drooping roses; pattering showers
6729,THE DEATH-BED,That soak the woods; not the harsh rain that sweeps
6730,THE DEATH-BED,"Behind the thunder, but a trickling peace"
6731,THE DEATH-BED,Gently and slowly washing life away.
6732,THE DEATH-BED,.    .    .    .    .
6733,THE DEATH-BED,"He stirred, shifting his body; then the pain"
6734,THE DEATH-BED,"Leaped like a prowling beast, and gripped and tore"
6735,THE DEATH-BED,His groping dreams with grinding claws and fangs.
6736,THE DEATH-BED,But some one was beside him; soon he lay
6737,THE DEATH-BED,Shuddering because that evil thing had passed.
6738,THE DEATH-BED,"And Death, who'd stepped toward him, paused and stared."
6739,THE DEATH-BED,
6740,THE DEATH-BED,Light many lamps and gather round his bed.
6741,THE DEATH-BED,"Lend him your eyes, warm blood, and will to live."
6742,THE DEATH-BED,Speak to him; rouse him; you may save him yet.
6743,THE DEATH-BED,He's young; he hated war; how should he die
6744,THE DEATH-BED,When cruel old campaigners win safe through?
6745,THE DEATH-BED,
6746,THE DEATH-BED,"But Death replied: 'I choose him.' So he went,"
6747,THE DEATH-BED,And there was silence in the summer night;
6748,THE DEATH-BED,Silence and safety; and the veils of sleep.
6749,THE DEATH-BED,"Then, far away, the thudding of the guns."

6757,COUNTER-ATTACK,We'd gained our first objective hours before
6758,COUNTER-ATTACK,"While dawn broke like a face with blinking eyes,"
6759,COUNTER-ATTACK,"Pallid, unshaved and thirsty, blind with smoke."
6760,COUNTER-ATTACK,"Things seemed all right at first. We held their line,"
6761,COUNTER-ATTACK,"With bombers posted, Lewis guns well placed,"
6762,COUNTER-ATTACK,And clink of shovels deepening the shallow trench.
6763,COUNTER-ATTACK,The place was rotten with dead; green clumsy legs
6764,COUNTER-ATTACK,"High-booted, sprawled and grovelled along the saps;"
6765,COUNTER-ATTACK,"And trunks, face downward, in the sucking mud,"
6766,COUNTER-ATTACK,Wallowed like trodden sand-bags loosely filled;
6767,COUNTER-ATTACK,"And naked sodden buttocks, mats of hair,"
6768,COUNTER-ATTACK,"Bulged, clotted heads slept in the plastering slime."
6769,COUNTER-ATTACK,"And then the rain began,--the jolly old rain!"
6770,COUNTER-ATTACK,"A yawning soldier knelt against the bank,"
6771,COUNTER-ATTACK,Staring across the morning blear with fog;
6772,COUNTER-ATTACK,He wondered when the Allemands would get busy;
6773,COUNTER-ATTACK,"And then, of course, they started with five-nines"
6774,COUNTER-ATTACK,"Traversing, sure as fate, and never a dud."
6775,COUNTER-ATTACK,"Mute in the clamour of shells he watched them burst,"
6776,COUNTER-ATTACK,"Spouting dark earth and wire with gusts from hell,"
6777,COUNTER-ATTACK,While posturing giants dissolved in drifts of smoke.
6778,COUNTER-ATTACK,"He crouched and flinched, dizzy with galloping fear,"
6779,COUNTER-ATTACK,"Sick for escape,--loathing the strangled horror"
6780,COUNTER-ATTACK,"And butchered, frantic gestures of the dead."
6781,COUNTER-ATTACK,
6782,COUNTER-ATTACK,An officer came blundering down the trench:
6783,COUNTER-ATTACK,"""Stand-to and man the fire-step!""  On he went ..."
6784,COUNTER-ATTACK,"Gasping and bawling, ""Fire-step... Counter-attack!"""
6785,COUNTER-ATTACK,Then the haze lifted. Bombing on the right
6786,COUNTER-ATTACK,Down the old sap: machine-guns on the left;
6787,COUNTER-ATTACK,And stumbling figures looming out in front.
6788,COUNTER-ATTACK,"""O Christ, they're coming at us!"" Bullets spat,"
6789,COUNTER-ATTACK,And he remembered his rifle ... rapid fire ...
6790,COUNTER-ATTACK,And started blazing wildly ... Then a bang
6791,COUNTER-ATTACK,"Crumpled and spun him sideways, knocked him out"
6792,COUNTER-ATTACK,To grunt and wriggle: none heeded him; he choked
6793,COUNTER-ATTACK,"And fought the flapping veils of smothering gloom,"
6794,COUNTER-ATTACK,Lost in a blurred confusion of yells and groans ...
6795,COUNTER-ATTACK,"Down, and down, and down, he sank and drowned,"
6796,COUNTER-ATTACK,Bleeding to death. The counter-attack had failed.

7064,THE ROCK POOL,"A wave lies prisoned. Far and far away,"
7065,THE ROCK POOL,"Outward to ocean, as the slow tide falls,"
7066,THE ROCK POOL,"Her sisters, through the capes that hold the bay,"
7067,THE ROCK POOL,Dancing in lovely liberty recede.
7068,THE ROCK POOL,"But lovely in captivity she lies,"
7069,THE ROCK POOL,"Filled with soft colours, where the waving weed"
7070,THE ROCK POOL,"Moves gently, and discloses to our eyes"
7071,THE ROCK POOL,Blurred shining veins of rock and lucent shells
7072,THE ROCK POOL,"Under the light-shot water, and here repose"
7073,THE ROCK POOL,"Small quiet fish, and dimly-glowing bells"

7084,THE SWIMMERS,"The cove's a shining plate of blue and green,"
7085,THE SWIMMERS,With darker belts between
7086,THE SWIMMERS,"The trough and crest of the slow-rising swell,"
7087,THE SWIMMERS,"And the great rocks throw purple shadows down,"
7088,THE SWIMMERS,Where transient sun-sparks wink and burst and drown
7089,THE SWIMMERS,"And glimmering pebbles lie too deep to tell,"
7090,THE SWIMMERS,Hidden or shining as the shadow wavers.
7091,THE SWIMMERS,And everywhere the restless sun-steeped air
7092,THE SWIMMERS,"Trembles and quavers,"
7093,THE SWIMMERS,As though it were
7094,THE SWIMMERS,More saturate with light than it could bear.
7095,THE SWIMMERS,
7096,THE SWIMMERS,"Now come the swimmers from slow-dripping caves,"
7097,THE SWIMMERS,"Where the shy fern creeps under the veined roof,"
7098,THE SWIMMERS,And wading out meet with glad breast the waves.
7099,THE SWIMMERS,"One holds aloof,"
7100,THE SWIMMERS,"Climbing alone the reef with shrinking feet,"
7101,THE SWIMMERS,That scarce endure the jagged stones' dull beat
7102,THE SWIMMERS,Till on the edge he poises
7103,THE SWIMMERS,"And flies to cleave the water, vanishing"
7104,THE SWIMMERS,"In wreaths of white, with echoing liquid noises,"
7105,THE SWIMMERS,"And swims beneath, a vague, distorted thing."
7106,THE SWIMMERS,Now all the other swimmers leave behind
7107,THE SWIMMERS,The crystal shallow and the foam-wet shore
7108,THE SWIMMERS,And sliding into deeper water find
7109,THE SWIMMERS,"A living coolness in the lifting flood,"
7110,THE SWIMMERS,"And through their bodies leaps the sparkling blood,"
7111,THE SWIMMERS,So that they feel the faint earth's drought no more.
7112,THE SWIMMERS,"There now they float, heads raised above the green,"
7113,THE SWIMMERS,"White bodies cloudily seen,"
7114,THE SWIMMERS,"Farther and farther from the brazen rock,"
7115,THE SWIMMERS,"On which the hot air shakes, on which the tide"
7116,THE SWIMMERS,"Fruitlessly throws with gentle, soundless shock"
7117,THE SWIMMERS,"The cool and lagging wave. Out, out they go,"
7118,THE SWIMMERS,And now upon a mirrored cloud they ride
7119,THE SWIMMERS,"Or turning over, with soft strokes and slow,"
7120,THE SWIMMERS,Slide on like shadows in a tranquil sky.
7121,THE SWIMMERS,"Behind them, on the tall, parched cliff, the dry"
7122,THE SWIMMERS,And dusty grasses grow
7123,THE SWIMMERS,"In shallow ledges of the arid stone,"
7124,THE SWIMMERS,Starving for coolness and the touch of rain.
7125,THE SWIMMERS,"But, though to earth they must return again,"
7126,THE SWIMMERS,"Here come the soft sea-airs to meet them, blown"
7127,THE SWIMMERS,"Over the surface of the outer deep,"
7128,THE SWIMMERS,"Scarce moving, staying, falling, straying, gone,"
7129,THE SWIMMERS,Light and delightful as the touch of sleep...
7130,THE SWIMMERS,"One wakes and splashes round,"
7131,THE SWIMMERS,"And, as by magic, all the others wake"
7132,THE SWIMMERS,"From that sea-dream, and now with rippling sound"
7133,THE SWIMMERS,Their rapid arms the enchanted silence break.
7134,THE SWIMMERS,And now again the crystal shallows take
7135,THE SWIMMERS,The gleaming bedies whose cool hour is done;
7136,THE SWIMMERS,"They pause upon the beach, they pause and sigh"
7137,THE SWIMMERS,Then vanish in the caverns one by one.
7138,THE SWIMMERS,
7139,THE SWIMMERS,Soon the wet foot-marks on the stones are dry:

7152,THE STORM,
7153,THE STORM,"The rain slackens, the wind blows gently,"
7154,THE STORM,"The gust grows gentle and stills,"
7155,THE STORM,"And the thunder, like a breaking stick,"

7255,DEIRDRE,And their sons' sons.
7256,DEIRDRE,
7257,DEIRDRE,The time comes when our hearts sink utterly;
7258,DEIRDRE,"When we remember Deirdre and her tale,"
7259,DEIRDRE,And that her lips are dust.
7260,DEIRDRE,
7261,DEIRDRE,Once she did tread the earth: men took her hand;
7262,DEIRDRE,"They looked into her eyes and said their say,"
7263,DEIRDRE,And she replied to them.
7264,DEIRDRE,
7265,DEIRDRE,More than a thousand years it is since she
7266,DEIRDRE,Was beautiful: she trod the waving grass;
7267,DEIRDRE,She saw the clouds.
7268,DEIRDRE,
7269,DEIRDRE,"A thousand years! The grass is still the same,"
7270,DEIRDRE,The clouds as lovely as they were that time
7271,DEIRDRE,When Deirdre was alive.
7272,DEIRDRE,
7273,DEIRDRE,But there has never been a woman born
7274,DEIRDRE,"Who was so beautiful, not one so beautiful"
7275,DEIRDRE,Of all the women born.
7276,DEIRDRE,
7277,DEIRDRE,Let all men go apart and mourn together;
7278,DEIRDRE,No man can ever love her; not a man
7279,DEIRDRE,Can ever be her lover.
7280,DEIRDRE,
7281,DEIRDRE,No man can bend before her: no man say--
7282,DEIRDRE,What could one say to her? There are no words
7283,DEIRDRE,That one could say to her!
7284,DEIRDRE,
7285,DEIRDRE,Now she is but a story that is told
7286,DEIRDRE,Beside the fire! No man can ever be

7317,THE GOAT PATHS,Crouching down where nothing stirs
7318,THE GOAT PATHS,"In the silence of the furze,"
7319,THE GOAT PATHS,Crouching down again to brood
7320,THE GOAT PATHS,In the sunny solitude.
7321,THE GOAT PATHS,
7322,THE GOAT PATHS,If I were as wise as they
7323,THE GOAT PATHS,"I would stray apart and brood,"

7326,THE GOAT PATHS,To a sunny solitude;
7327,THE GOAT PATHS,"And should you come I'd run away,"
7328,THE GOAT PATHS,"I would make an angry sound,"
7329,THE GOAT PATHS,I would stare and turn and bound
7330,THE GOAT PATHS,"To the deeper quietude,"
7331,THE GOAT PATHS,To the place where nothing stirs
7332,THE GOAT PATHS,In the silence of the furze.
7333,THE GOAT PATHS,
7334,THE GOAT PATHS,In that airy quietness
7335,THE GOAT PATHS,I would think as long as they;
7336,THE GOAT PATHS,Through the quiet sunniness
7337,THE GOAT PATHS,I would stray away to brood
7338,THE GOAT PATHS,By a hidden beaten way
7339,THE GOAT PATHS,In a sunny solitude.
7340,THE GOAT PATHS,

7492,ASPENS,"All day and night, save winter, every weather,"
7493,ASPENS,"Above the inn, the smithy, and the shop,"
7494,ASPENS,The aspens at the cross-roads talk together
7495,ASPENS,"Of rain, until their last leaves fall from the top."
7496,ASPENS,
7497,ASPENS,Out of the blacksmith's cavern comes the ringing
7498,ASPENS,"Of hammer, shoe, and anvil; out of the inn"
7499,ASPENS,"The clink, the hum, the roar, the random singing--The"
7500,ASPENS,sounds that for these fifty years have been.
7501,ASPENS,
7502,ASPENS,"The whisper of the aspens is not drowned,"
7503,ASPENS,"And over lightless pane and footless road,"
7504,ASPENS,"Empty as sky, with every other sound"
7505,ASPENS,"Not ceasing, calls their ghosts from their abode."
7506,ASPENS,
7507,ASPENS,"A silent smithy, a silent inn, not fails"
7508,ASPENS,"In the bare moonlight or the thick-furred gloom,"
7509,ASPENS,"In tempest or the night of nightingales,"
7510,ASPENS,To turn the cross-roads to a ghostly room.
7511,ASPENS,
7512,ASPENS,And it would be the same were no house near.
7513,ASPENS,"Over all sorts of weather, men, and times,"
7514,ASPENS,A spens must shake their leaves and men may hear
7515,ASPENS,"But need not listen, more than to my rhymes."
7516,ASPENS,
7517,ASPENS,"Whatever wind blows, while they and I have leaves"
7518,ASPENS,We cannot other than an aspen be
7519,ASPENS,"That ceaselessly, unreasonably grieves,"
7520,ASPENS,Or so men think who like a different tree.

7527,THE BROOK,
7528,THE BROOK,"Seated once by a brook, watching a child"
7529,THE BROOK,"Chiefly that paddled, I was thus beguiled."
7530,THE BROOK,Mellow the blackbird sang and sharp the thrush
7531,THE BROOK,"Not far off in the oak and hazel brush,"
7532,THE BROOK,Unseen. There was a scent like honeycomb
7533,THE BROOK,From mugwort dull. And down upon the dome
7534,THE BROOK,Of the stone the cart-horse kicks against so oft
7535,THE BROOK,A butterfly alighted. From aloft
7536,THE BROOK,"He took the heat of the sun, and from below,"
7537,THE BROOK,"On the hot stone he perched contented so,"
7538,THE BROOK,As if never a cart would pass again
7539,THE BROOK,That way; as if I were the last of men
7540,THE BROOK,And he the first of insects to have earth
7541,THE BROOK,"And sun together and to know their worth,"
7542,THE BROOK,"I was divided between him and the gleam,"
7543,THE BROOK,"The motion, and the voices, of the stream,"
7544,THE BROOK,"The waters running frizzled over gravel,"
7545,THE BROOK,That never vanish and for ever travel.
7546,THE BROOK,A grey flycatcher silent on a fence
7547,THE BROOK,And I sat as if we had been there since
7548,THE BROOK,The horseman and the horse lying beneath
7549,THE BROOK,"The fir-tree-covered barrow on the heath,"
7550,THE BROOK,"The horseman and the horse with silver shoes,"
7551,THE BROOK,Galloped the downs last. All that I could lose
7552,THE BROOK,I lost. And then the child's voice raised the dead.
7553,THE BROOK,"""No one's been here before"" was what she said"
7554,THE BROOK,"And what I felt, yet never should have found"
7555,THE BROOK,"A word for, while I gathered sight and sound."

7565,THE BRIDGE,"Remembering friends, old friends,"
7566,THE BRIDGE,"I rest, without smile or moan,"
7567,THE BRIDGE,As they remember me without smile or moan.
7568,THE BRIDGE,
7569,THE BRIDGE,"All are behind, the kind"
7570,THE BRIDGE,"And the unkind too, no more"
7571,THE BRIDGE,To-night than a dream. The stream
7572,THE BRIDGE,"Runs softly yet drowns the Past,"
7573,THE BRIDGE,The dark-lit stream has drowned the Future and the Past.
7574,THE BRIDGE,
7575,THE BRIDGE,No traveller has rest more blest
7576,THE BRIDGE,Than this moment brief between
7577,THE BRIDGE,"Two lives, when the Night's first lights"
7578,THE BRIDGE,"And shades hide what has never been,"
7579,THE BRIDGE,"Things goodlier, lovelier, dearer, than will be or have been."

7718,THE PATH,"Content themselves with the road, and what they see"

7876,ECSTASY,I saw a frieze on whitest marble drawn
7877,ECSTASY,"Of boys who sought for shells along the shore,"
7878,ECSTASY,"Their white feet shedding pallor in the sea,"
7879,ECSTASY,"The shallow sea, the spring-time sea of green"
7880,ECSTASY,"That faintly creamed against the cold, smooth pebbles."
7881,ECSTASY,
7882,ECSTASY,"The air was thin, their limbs were delicate,"
7883,ECSTASY,The wind had graven their small eager hands
7884,ECSTASY,To feel the forests and the dark nights of Asia
7885,ECSTASY,"Behind the purple bloom of the horizon,"
7886,ECSTASY,Where sails would float and slowly melt away.
7887,ECSTASY,
7888,ECSTASY,"Their naked, pure, and grave, unbroken silence"
7889,ECSTASY,"Filled the soft air as gleaming, limpid water"
7890,ECSTASY,Fills a spring sky those days when rain is lying
7891,ECSTASY,"In shattered bright pools on the wind-dried roads,"
7892,ECSTASY,And their sweet bodies were wind-purified.
7893,ECSTASY,
7894,ECSTASY,One held a shell unto his shell-like ear
7895,ECSTASY,"And there was music carven in his face,"
7896,ECSTASY,"His eyes half-closed, his lips just breaking open"
7897,ECSTASY,"To catch the lulling, mazy, coralline roar"
7898,ECSTASY,Of numberless caverns filled with singing seas.
7899,ECSTASY,
7900,ECSTASY,And all of them were hearkening as to singing
7901,ECSTASY,"Of far off voices thin and delicate,"
7902,ECSTASY,Voices too fine for any mortal mind
7903,ECSTASY,To blow into the whorls of mortal ears--
7904,ECSTASY,"And yet those sounds flowed from their grave, sweet faces."
7905,ECSTASY,
7906,ECSTASY,"And as I looked I heard that delicate music,"
7907,ECSTASY,"And I became as grave, as calm, as still"
7908,ECSTASY,"As those carved boys. I stood upon that shore,"
7909,ECSTASY,"I felt the cool sea dream around my feet,"
7910,ECSTASY,My eyes were staring at the far horizon:
7911,ECSTASY,
7912,ECSTASY,"And the wind came and purified my limbs,"
7913,ECSTASY,"And the stars came and set within my eyes,"
7914,ECSTASY,"And snowy clouds rested upon my shoulders,"
7915,ECSTASY,"And the blue sky shimmered deep within me,"
7916,ECSTASY,And I sang like a carven pipe of music.

7938,KENT IN WAR,Down at the bottom of the road
7939,KENT IN WAR,I smell the woody damp
7940,KENT IN WAR,"Of that cold spirit in the grass,"
7941,KENT IN WAR,And leave my hill-top camp--
7942,KENT IN WAR,Its long gun pointing in the sky--And
7943,KENT IN WAR,take the Moon for lamp.
7944,KENT IN WAR,
7945,KENT IN WAR,I stop beside the bright cold glint
7946,KENT IN WAR,"Of that thin spirit of the grass,"
7947,KENT IN WAR,"So gay it is, so innocent!"
7948,KENT IN WAR,I watch its sparkling footsteps pass
7949,KENT IN WAR,"Lightly from smooth round stone to stone,"
7950,KENT IN WAR,Hid in the dew-hung grass.
7951,KENT IN WAR,
7952,KENT IN WAR,"My lamp shines in the globes of dew,"
7953,KENT IN WAR,And leaps into that crystal wind
7954,KENT IN WAR,Running along the shaken grass
7955,KENT IN WAR,To each dark hole that it can find--
7956,KENT IN WAR,"The crystal wind, the Moon my lamp,"
7957,KENT IN WAR,Have vanished in a wood that's blind.
7958,KENT IN WAR,
7959,KENT IN WAR,"High lies my small, my shadowy camp,"
7960,KENT IN WAR,Crowded about by small dark hills;
7961,KENT IN WAR,With sudden small white flowers the sky
7962,KENT IN WAR,Above the woods' dark greenness fills;
7963,KENT IN WAR,"And hosts of dark-browed, muttering trees"
7964,KENT IN WAR,In trance the white Moon stills.
7965,KENT IN WAR,
7966,KENT IN WAR,"I move among their tall grey forms,"
7967,KENT IN WAR,"A thin moon-glimmering, wandering Ghost,"
7968,KENT IN WAR,Who takes his lantern through the world
7969,KENT IN WAR,"In search of life that he has lost,"
7970,KENT IN WAR,While watching by that long lean gun
7971,KENT IN WAR,Upon his small hill post.

7977,DEATH,
7978,DEATH,
7979,DEATH,When I am dead a few poor souls shall grieve
7980,DEATH,As I grieved for my brother long ago.
7981,DEATH,"Scarce did my eyes grow dim,"
7982,DEATH,I had forgotten him;
7983,DEATH,"I was far-off hearing the spring winds blow,"
7984,DEATH,And many summers burned
7985,DEATH,"When, though still reeling with my eyes aflame,"
7986,DEATH,I heard that faded name
7987,DEATH,Whispered one Spring amid the hurrying world
7988,DEATH,"From which, years gone, he turned."
7989,DEATH,
7990,DEATH,I looked up at my windows and I saw
7991,DEATH,"The trees, thin spectres sucked forth by the moon."
7992,DEATH,The air was very still
7993,DEATH,Above a distant hill;
7994,DEATH,It was the hour of night's full silver moon.
7995,DEATH,"""O art thou there my brother?"" my soul cried;"
7996,DEATH,"And all the pale stars down bright rivers wept,"
7997,DEATH,As my heart sadly crept
7998,DEATH,"About the empty hills, bathed in that light"
7999,DEATH,That lapped him when he died.
8000,DEATH,
8001,DEATH,"Ah! it was cold, so cold; do I not know"
8002,DEATH,How dead my heart on that remembered day!
8003,DEATH,Clear in a far-away place
8004,DEATH,I see his delicate face
8005,DEATH,"Just as he called me from my solitary play,"
8006,DEATH,Giving into my hands a tiny tree.
8007,DEATH,"We planted it in the dark, blossomless ground"
8008,DEATH,"Gravely, without a sound;"
8009,DEATH,Then back I went and left him standing by
8010,DEATH,His birthday gift to me.
8011,DEATH,
8012,DEATH,In that far land perchance it quietly grows
8013,DEATH,"Drinking the rain, making a pleasant shade;"
8014,DEATH,Birds in its branches fly
8015,DEATH,Out of the fathomless sky
8016,DEATH,"Where worlds of circling light arise and fade,"
8017,DEATH,"Blindly it quivers in the bright flood of day,"
8018,DEATH,Or drowned in multitudinous shouts of rain
8019,DEATH,Glooms o'er the dark-veiled plain--Buried
8020,DEATH,"below, the ghost that's in his bones"
8021,DEATH,Dreams in the sodden clay.
8022,DEATH,
8023,DEATH,"And, while he faded, drunk with beauty's eyes"
8024,DEATH,"I kissed bright girls and laughed deep in dumb trees,"
8025,DEATH,That stared fixt in the air
8026,DEATH,Like madmen in despair
8027,DEATH,Gaped up from earth with the escaping breeze.
8028,DEATH,I saw earth's exaltation slowly creep
8029,DEATH,Out of their myriad sky-embracing veins.
8030,DEATH,"I laughed along the lanes,"
8031,DEATH,Meeting Death riding in from the hollow seas
8032,DEATH,Through black-wreathed woods asleep.
8033,DEATH,
8034,DEATH,"I laughed, I swaggered on the cold, hard ground"
8035,DEATH,Through the grey air trembled a falling wave--
8036,DEATH,"""Thou'rt pale, O Death!"" I cried,"
8037,DEATH,Mocking him in my pride;
8038,DEATH,"And passing I dreamed not of that lonely grave,"
8039,DEATH,"But of leaf-maidens whose pale, moon-like hands"
8040,DEATH,"Above the tree-foam waved in the icy air,"
8041,DEATH,Sweeping with shining hair
8042,DEATH,"Through the green-tinted sky, one moment fled"
8043,DEATH,Out of immortal lands.
8044,DEATH,
8045,DEATH,One windless Autumn night the Moon came out
8046,DEATH,"In a white sea of cloud, a field of snow;"
8047,DEATH,"In darkness shaped of trees,"
8048,DEATH,I sank upon my knees
8049,DEATH,"And watched her shining, from the small wood below--"
8050,DEATH,Faintly Death flickered in an owl's far cry--
8051,DEATH,"We floated soundless in the great gulf of space,"
8052,DEATH,"Her light upon my face--Immortal,"
8053,DEATH,shining in that dark wood I knelt
8054,DEATH,And knew I could not die.
8055,DEATH,
8056,DEATH,And knew I could not die--O Death did'st thou
8057,DEATH,"Heed my vain glory, standing pale by thy dead?"
8058,DEATH,There is a spirit who grieves
8059,DEATH,Amid earth's dying leaves;
8060,DEATH,Was't thou that wept beside my brother's bed?
8061,DEATH,For I did never mourn nor heed at all
8062,DEATH,Him passing on his temporal elm-wood bier;
8063,DEATH,I never shed a tear.
8064,DEATH,"The drooping sky spread grey-winged through my soul,"
8065,DEATH,While stones and earth did fall.
8066,DEATH,
8067,DEATH,That sound rings down the years--I hear it yet--
8068,DEATH,All earthly life's a winding funeral--
8069,DEATH,"And though I never wept,"
8070,DEATH,"But into the dark coach stept,"
8071,DEATH,"Dreaming by night to answer the blood's sweet call,"
8072,DEATH,"She who stood there, high breasted, with small wise lips,"
8073,DEATH,"And gave me wine to drink and bread to eat,"
8074,DEATH,"Has not more steadfast feet,"
8075,DEATH,But fades from my arms as fade from mariners' eyes
8076,DEATH,The sea's most beauteous ships.
8077,DEATH,
8078,DEATH,The trees and hills of earth were once as close
8079,DEATH,"As my own brother, they are becoming dreams"
8080,DEATH,And shadows in my eyes;
8081,DEATH,More dimly lies
8082,DEATH,"Guaya deep in my soul, the coastline gleams"
8083,DEATH,Faintly along the darkening crystalline seas.
8084,DEATH,"Glimmering and lovely still, 'twill one day go;"
8085,DEATH,The surging dark will flow
8086,DEATH,"Over my hopes and joys, and blot out all"
8087,DEATH,Earth's hills and skies and trees.
8088,DEATH,
8089,DEATH,I shall look up one night and see the Moon
8090,DEATH,"For the last time shining above the hills,"
8091,DEATH,"And thou, silent, wilt ride"
8092,DEATH,Over the dark hillside.
8093,DEATH,"'Twill be, perchance, the time of daffodils--"
8094,DEATH,"_""How come those bright immortals in the woods?_"
8095,DEATH,"_Their joy being young, did'st thou not drag them all_"
8096,DEATH,"_Into dark graves ere Fall?""_"
8097,DEATH,"Shall life thus haunt me, wondering, as I go"
8098,DEATH,To thy deep solitudes?
8099,DEATH,
8100,DEATH,There is a figure with a down-turned torch
8101,DEATH,"Carved on a pillar in an olden time,"
8102,DEATH,A calm and lovely boy
8103,DEATH,Who comes not to destroy
8104,DEATH,But to lead age back to its golden prime.
8105,DEATH,"Thus did an antique sculptor draw thee, Death,"
8106,DEATH,"With smooth and beauteous brow and faint sweet smile,"
8107,DEATH,"Nor haggard, gaunt and vile,"
8108,DEATH,And thou perhaps art Him to whom men may
8109,DEATH,"Unvexed, give up their breath."
8110,DEATH,
8111,DEATH,But in my soul thou sittest like a dream
8112,DEATH,"Among earth's mountains, by her dim-coloured seas;"
8113,DEATH,A wild unearthly Shape
8114,DEATH,"In thy dark-glimmering cape,"
8115,DEATH,"Piping a tune of wavering melodies,"
8116,DEATH,"Thou sittest, ay, thou sittest at the feast"
8117,DEATH,"Of my brief life among earth's bright-wreathed flowers,"
8118,DEATH,Stemming the dancing hours
8119,DEATH,"With sombre gleams until abrupt, thou risest"
8120,DEATH,"And all, at once, is ceased."

8136,SOLDIERS IN A SMALL CAMP,Or move as winds dark-waving in a wood.
8137,SOLDIERS IN A SMALL CAMP,
8138,SOLDIERS IN A SMALL CAMP,Staring at cattle on a neighbouring hill
8139,SOLDIERS IN A SMALL CAMP,They are oblivious as is stone or grass--The
8140,SOLDIERS IN A SMALL CAMP,"clouds passed voiceless over, and the sun"
8141,SOLDIERS IN A SMALL CAMP,"Rose, and lit trees, and vanished utterly."
8142,SOLDIERS IN A SMALL CAMP,

8152,SOLDIERS IN A SMALL CAMP,

8156,SOLDIERS IN A SMALL CAMP,And feel the darkness fumbling at their souls.
8157,SOLDIERS IN A SMALL CAMP,

8353,SONG OF THE DARK AGES,"The age of iron, pick and spade,"
8354,SONG OF THE DARK AGES,"Here jostles with the Age of Stone."""
8355,SONG OF THE DARK AGES,
8356,SONG OF THE DARK AGES,Yet either from that happier race
8357,SONG OF THE DARK AGES,Will merit but a passing glance;
8358,SONG OF THE DARK AGES,And they will leave us both alone:
8359,SONG OF THE DARK AGES,Poor savages who wrought in stone--Poor
8360,SONG OF THE DARK AGES,Poor savages who fought in France.

8367,BÊTE HUMAINE,
8368,BÊTE HUMAINE,"Riding through Ruwu swamp, about sunrise,"
8369,BÊTE HUMAINE,I saw the world awake; and as the ray
8370,BÊTE HUMAINE,"Touched the tall grasses where they sleeping lay,"
8371,BÊTE HUMAINE,"Lo, the bright air alive with dragonflies:"
8372,BÊTE HUMAINE,"With brittle wings aquiver, and great eyes"
8373,BÊTE HUMAINE,"Piloting crimson bodies, slender and gay."
8374,BÊTE HUMAINE,"I aimed at one, and struck it, and it lay"
8375,BÊTE HUMAINE,"Broken and lifeless, with fast-fading dyes ..."
8376,BÊTE HUMAINE,Then my soul sickened with a sudden pain
8377,BÊTE HUMAINE,"And horror, at my own careless cruelty,"
8378,BÊTE HUMAINE,That in an idle moment I had slain
8379,BÊTE HUMAINE,A creature whose sweet life it is to fly:
8380,BÊTE HUMAINE,Like beasts that prey with tooth and claw ...
8381,BÊTE HUMAINE,"Nay, they"

8390,THE GIFT,"Marching on Tanga, marching the parch'd plain"
8391,THE GIFT,"Of wavering spear-grass past Pangani river,"
8392,THE GIFT,England came to me--me who had always ta'en
8393,THE GIFT,"But never given before--England, the giver,"
8394,THE GIFT,In a vision of three poplar-trees that shiver
8395,THE GIFT,"On still evenings of summer, after rain,"
8396,THE GIFT,"By Slapton Ley, where reed-beds start and quiver"
8397,THE GIFT,When scarce a ripple moves the upland grain.
8398,THE GIFT,Then I thanked God that now I had suffered pain
8399,THE GIFT,"And, as the parch'd plain, thirst, and lain awake"
8400,THE GIFT,Shivering all night through till cold daybreak:
8401,THE GIFT,In that I count these sufferings my gain
8402,THE GIFT,"And her acknowledgment. Nay, more, would fain"
8403,THE GIFT,Suffer as many more for her sweet sake.

8409,THE LEANING ELM,
8410,THE LEANING ELM,
8411,THE LEANING ELM,"Before my window, in days of winter hoar"
8412,THE LEANING ELM,Huddled a mournful wood;
8413,THE LEANING ELM,"Smooth pillars of beech, domed chestnut, sycamore,"
8414,THE LEANING ELM,In stony sleep they stood:
8415,THE LEANING ELM,"But you, unhappy elm, the angry west"
8416,THE LEANING ELM,"Had chosen from the rest,"
8417,THE LEANING ELM,"Flung broken on your brothers' branches bare,"
8418,THE LEANING ELM,And left you leaning there
8419,THE LEANING ELM,So dead that when the breath of winter cast
8420,THE LEANING ELM,"Wild snow upon the blast,"
8421,THE LEANING ELM,"The other living branches, downward bowed,"
8422,THE LEANING ELM,Shook free their crystal shroud
8423,THE LEANING ELM,And shed upon your blackened trunk beneath
8424,THE LEANING ELM,Their livery of death......
8425,THE LEANING ELM,
8426,THE LEANING ELM,On windless nights between the beechen bars
8427,THE LEANING ELM,I watched cold stars
8428,THE LEANING ELM,"Throb whitely in the sky, and dreamily"
8429,THE LEANING ELM,Wondered if any life lay locked in thee:
8430,THE LEANING ELM,If still the hidden sap secretly moved
8431,THE LEANING ELM,As water in the icy winterbourne
8432,THE LEANING ELM,Floweth unheard:
8433,THE LEANING ELM,And half I pitied you your trance forlorn:
8434,THE LEANING ELM,"You could not hear, I thought, the voice of any bird,"
8435,THE LEANING ELM,The shadowy cries of bats in dim twilight
8436,THE LEANING ELM,Or cool voices of owls crying by night ...
8437,THE LEANING ELM,Hunting by night under the horned moon:
8438,THE LEANING ELM,"Yet half I envied you your wintry swoon,"
8439,THE LEANING ELM,"Till, on this morning mild, the sun, new-risen"
8440,THE LEANING ELM,Steals from his misty prison;
8441,THE LEANING ELM,"The frozen fallows glow, the black trees shaken"
8442,THE LEANING ELM,In a clear flood of sunlight vibrating awaken:
8443,THE LEANING ELM,"And lo, your ravaged hole, beyond belief"
8444,THE LEANING ELM,Slenderly fledged anew with tender leaf
8445,THE LEANING ELM,As pale as those twin vanes that break at last
8446,THE LEANING ELM,In a tiny fan above the black beech-mast
8447,THE LEANING ELM,Where no blade springeth green
8448,THE LEANING ELM,But pallid bells of the shy helleborine.
8449,THE LEANING ELM,What is this ecstasy that overwhelms
8450,THE LEANING ELM,"The dreaming earth? See, the embrownèd elms"
8451,THE LEANING ELM,Crowding purple distances warm the depths of the wood:
8452,THE LEANING ELM,"A new-born wind tosses their tassels brown,"
8453,THE LEANING ELM,His white clouds dapple the down:
8454,THE LEANING ELM,Into a green flame bursting the hedgerows stand.
8455,THE LEANING ELM,
8456,THE LEANING ELM,"Soon, with banners flying, Spring will walk the land...."
8457,THE LEANING ELM,"There is no day for thee, my soul, like this,"
8458,THE LEANING ELM,"No spring of lovely words. Nay, even the kiss"
8459,THE LEANING ELM,Of mortal love that maketh man divine
8460,THE LEANING ELM,This light cannot outshine:
8461,THE LEANING ELM,"Nay, even poets, they whose frail hands catch"
8462,THE LEANING ELM,"The shadow of vanishing beauty, may not match"
8463,THE LEANING ELM,This leafy ecstasy. Sweet words may cull
8464,THE LEANING ELM,Such magical beauty as time may not destroy;
8465,THE LEANING ELM,"But we, alas, are not more beautiful:"
8466,THE LEANING ELM,We cannot flower in beauty as in joy.
8467,THE LEANING ELM,"We sing, our mused words are sped, and then"
8468,THE LEANING ELM,Poets are only men
8469,THE LEANING ELM,"Who age, and toil, and sicken ... This maim'd tree"
8470,THE LEANING ELM,May stand in leaf when I have ceased to be.

8477,PROTHALAMION,
8478,PROTHALAMION,When the evening came my love said to me:
8479,PROTHALAMION,Let us go into the garden now that the sky is cool;
8480,PROTHALAMION,The garden of black hellebore and rosemary
8481,PROTHALAMION,Where wild woodruff spills in a milky pool.
8482,PROTHALAMION,
8483,PROTHALAMION,"Low we passed in the twilight, for the wavering heat"
8484,PROTHALAMION,Of day had waned; and round that shaded plot
8485,PROTHALAMION,Of secret beauty the thickets clustered sweet:
8486,PROTHALAMION,"Here is heaven, our hearts whispered, but our lips spake not."
8487,PROTHALAMION,
8488,PROTHALAMION,Between that old garden and seas of lazy foam
8489,PROTHALAMION,Gloomy and beautiful alleys of trees arise
8490,PROTHALAMION,"With spire of cypress and dreamy beechen dome,"
8491,PROTHALAMION,So dark that our enchanted sight knew nothing but the skies
8492,PROTHALAMION,
8493,PROTHALAMION,"Veiled with a soft air, drench'd in the roses' musk"
8494,PROTHALAMION,"Or the dusky, dark carnation's breath of clove:"
8495,PROTHALAMION,"No stars burned in their deeps, but through the dusk"
8496,PROTHALAMION,"I saw my love's eyes, and they were brimmed with love."
8497,PROTHALAMION,
8498,PROTHALAMION,"No star their secret ravished, no wasting moon"
8499,PROTHALAMION,Mocked the sad transience of those eternal hours:
8500,PROTHALAMION,"Only the soft unseeing heaven of June,"
8501,PROTHALAMION,"The ghosts of great trees, and the sleeping flowers."
8502,PROTHALAMION,
8503,PROTHALAMION,For doves that crooned in the leafy noonday now
8504,PROTHALAMION,"Were silent; the night-jar sought his secret covers,"
8505,PROTHALAMION,Nor even a mild sea-whisper moved a creaking bough--
8506,PROTHALAMION,Was ever a silence deeper made for lovers?
8507,PROTHALAMION,
8508,PROTHALAMION,Was ever a moment meeter made for love?
8509,PROTHALAMION,Beautiful are your close lips beneath my kiss;
8510,PROTHALAMION,And all your yielding sweetness beautiful--
8511,PROTHALAMION,"Oh, never in all the world was such a night as this!"
8512,PROTHALAMION,
