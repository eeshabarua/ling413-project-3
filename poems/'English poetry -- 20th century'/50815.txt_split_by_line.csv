233,FAVETE LINGUIS,Like some long benediction now
234,FAVETE LINGUIS,Closes upon me: spirit-born
235,FAVETE LINGUIS,Tranquillity enfolds each worn
236,FAVETE LINGUIS,"Wan thought, with slender fingers cool"

253,TINTAGIL,I lay on the verge of a Western cliff
254,TINTAGIL,"On a waning Summer's day,"
255,TINTAGIL,And watched the seagulls' skimming flight
256,TINTAGIL,As their shrill call filled the bay.
257,TINTAGIL,
258,TINTAGIL,The waves rolled on from pool to pool
259,TINTAGIL,To the end of the rock-strewn lea:
260,TINTAGIL,"Where a glistening stream through a vale sped on,"
261,TINTAGIL,"With its leaping trout, to the sea."
262,TINTAGIL,
263,TINTAGIL,"The wind rose, too, from a breath to a blast"
264,TINTAGIL,"As the rising tide drew near,"
265,TINTAGIL,"And the rain-clouds swelled from the distant deep,"
266,TINTAGIL,So I knew 'twas a storm to fear.
267,TINTAGIL,
268,TINTAGIL,"I've lived on that coast for years now,"
269,TINTAGIL,And I love the roar of the waves
270,TINTAGIL,"As they lash the seaweed on the shore,"
271,TINTAGIL,And the cold grey rocks and the caves.

910,DE MUNDO[A],... And then arose the vision of the world
911,DE MUNDO[A],"Immense, a tangle of dark ravelled time,"
912,DE MUNDO[A],Twisted and knotted by a surge of men:
913,DE MUNDO[A],Vast sombre tribes forth from the old abyss
914,DE MUNDO[A],"Clambering, travailed, hated, fought and fell."
915,DE MUNDO[A],"The slow tower, stone upon laborious stone,"
916,DE MUNDO[A],"Compacting men and clans, cities and states,"
917,DE MUNDO[A],Aspired through ages to the unknown god:
918,DE MUNDO[A],"Adventurers with the guidance of no star,"
919,DE MUNDO[A],"Discovering all, rich isle and barren shore,"
920,DE MUNDO[A],And ever seas beyond the indolent seas
921,DE MUNDO[A],Rounding known courses with uncharted doubt:
922,DE MUNDO[A],"A people wandering in the wilderness,"
923,DE MUNDO[A],"So vague a cloud, so dim a pillar of fire"
924,DE MUNDO[A],They blindly followed to a promised land
925,DE MUNDO[A],Flowing with rivers of perennial truth--
926,DE MUNDO[A],"And they the chosen vessel,--who of old"
927,DE MUNDO[A],Knew not wherefore they broke their bonds and fled.
928,DE MUNDO[A],Yet in the end a desolation came
929,DE MUNDO[A],And the golden bowl was broken....
930,DE MUNDO[A],"I saw men, symbols of humanity,--"
931,DE MUNDO[A],"Immortal longings bound in mortal clay,--"
932,DE MUNDO[A],Wayfaring still upon the ancient road
933,DE MUNDO[A],Winding away to the invisible hills.
934,DE MUNDO[A],
935,DE MUNDO[A],Still on the visionary scaffolding
936,DE MUNDO[A],"The players played the old Morality,--"
937,DE MUNDO[A],"The pilgrim Life waylaid by cruel Despair,"
938,DE MUNDO[A],"Wealth dowering Evil and maltreating Good,"
939,DE MUNDO[A],"And Pain and Care tormenting Body and Soul,"
940,DE MUNDO[A],"And Giant Sin bestriding hill and dale,"
941,DE MUNDO[A],Building his shrines for men to worship him;
942,DE MUNDO[A],"Corruption, too, with serpents in his hair,"
943,DE MUNDO[A],"And next, obscene Ungodliness, whose eyes"
944,DE MUNDO[A],"Vacant and dull, bent ever on the earth."
945,DE MUNDO[A],"Then, last of all, Humanum Genus came"
946,DE MUNDO[A],Bearing a scroll with the Apostle's words--
947,DE MUNDO[A],"""Having no hope and without God in the world."""
948,DE MUNDO[A],
949,DE MUNDO[A],So from the seat of vision I arose
950,DE MUNDO[A],"Trembling, appalled, and went upon my way"
951,DE MUNDO[A],"Sadly, for all my vision ended in this--"
952,DE MUNDO[A],"Piercing of heart, reason's bewilderment--"
953,DE MUNDO[A],"""We've come from mystery and to mystery go."""
954,DE MUNDO[A],
955,DE MUNDO[A],What shall be said when all things have been said?
956,DE MUNDO[A],What shall be said when this is pondered on--
957,DE MUNDO[A],"""Either He lives not who created man,"
958,DE MUNDO[A],Or man for sin is cast forth from His grace;

1155,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Nor marks how clean that Hymen slipped away
1156,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,From me who seek in song the real A.
1157,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Wake, then, to your first ardour and the sight,"
1158,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"O lonely faun, of the old fierce white light,"
1159,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"With, lilies, one of you for innocence."
1160,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,
1161,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Other than their lips' delicate pretence,"
1162,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"The light caress that quiets treacherous lovers,"
1163,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"My breast, I know not how to tell, discovers"
1164,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,The bitten print of some immortal's kiss.
1165,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,But hush! a mystery so great as this
1166,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"I dare not tell, save to my double reed,"
1167,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Which, sharer of my every joy and need,"
1168,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Dreams down its cadenced monologues that we
1169,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Falsely confuse the beauties that we see
1170,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,With the bright palpable shapes our song creates:
1171,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"My flute, as loud as passion modulates,"
1172,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Purges the common dream of flank and breast,"
1173,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Seen through closed eyes and inwardly caressed,"
1174,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Of every empty and monotonous line.
1175,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,
1176,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Bloom then, O Syrinx, in thy flight malign,"
1177,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,A reed once more beside our trysting-lake.
1178,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Proud of my music let me often make
1179,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,A song of goddesses and see their rape
1180,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Profanely done on many a painted shape.
1181,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"So, when the grape's transparent juice I drain,"
1182,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,I quell regrets for pleasure past and feign
1183,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,A new real grape. For holding towards the sky
1184,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"The empty skin, I blow it tight and lie"
1185,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Dream-drunk till evening, eyeing it."
1186,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,
1187,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Tell o'er
1188,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Remembered joys and plump the grape once more.
1189,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,_Between the reeds I saw their bodies gleam
1190,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Who cool no mortal fever in the stream,"
1191,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Crying to the woods the rage of their desire:
1192,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,And their bright hair went down in jewelled fire
1193,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Where crystal broke and dazzled shudderingly.
1194,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"I check my swift pursuit; for see where lie,"
1195,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Bruised, being twins in love, by languor sweet,"
1196,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Two sleeping girls, clasped at my very feet."
1197,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"I seize and run with them, nor part the pair,"
1198,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Breaking this covert of frail petals, where"
1199,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Roses drink scent of the sun and our light play
1200,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,'Mid tumbled flowers shall match the death of day._
1201,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"I love that virginal fury, ah! the wild"
1202,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Thrill when a maiden body shrinks, defiled,"
1203,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Shuddering like arctic light, from lips that sear"
1204,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Its nakedness ... the flesh in secret fear!
1205,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Contagiously through my linked pair it flies
1206,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Where innocence in either, struggling, dies,"
1207,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Wet with fond tears or some less piteous dew.
1208,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Gay in the conquest of these fears, I grew"
1209,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,So rash that I must needs the sheaf divide
1210,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Of ruffled kisses heaven itself had tied.
1211,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,_For as I leaned to stifle in the hair
1212,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Of one my passionate laughter (taking care
1213,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"With a stretched finger, that her innocence"
1214,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Might stain with her companion's kindling sense,"
1215,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"To touch the younger little one, who lay"
1216,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Child-like unblushing) my ungrateful prey
1217,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Slips from me, freed by passion's sudden death,"
1218,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Nor heeds the frenzy of my sobbing breath._
1219,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Let it pass! others of their hair shall twist
1220,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,A rope to drag me to those joys I missed.
1221,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,See how the bursting currants ripe and red
1222,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,To quench the thirst of the mumbling bees have bled;
1223,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"So too our blood, kindled by some chance fire,"
1224,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Flows for the swarming legions of desire.
1225,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"At evening, when the woodland green turns gold"
1226,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"And ashen-grey, 'mid the quenched leaves, behold!"
1227,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Red Etna glows, by Venus visited,"
1228,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Walking the lava with her snowy tread
1229,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Whene'er the flames in thunderous slumber die.
1230,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,I hold the goddess!
1231,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,
1232,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Ah, sure penalty!"
1233,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,But the unthinking soul and body swoon
1234,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,At last beneath the heavy hush of noon.
1235,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,Forgetful let me lie where summer's drouth
1236,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Sifts fine the sand, and then with gaping mouth"
1237,L'APRÈS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE,"Dream, planet-struck by the grape's round wine-red star."

1572,I.,"And happy comradeship of weathered men,"
1573,I.,"All had been as in purpose due and well,"
1574,I.,Honourable my service had been then
1575,I.,And honoured the blank spot on which I fell.
1576,I.,
1577,I.,"But now--O heart!--how much dishonoured I,"
1578,I.,And by my own hand too--twice bitter case--
1579,I.,"My true love stained with secret infamy,"
1580,I.,"My treachery disguised by friendship's face,"
1581,I.,And that bare passion bade me forth to die

1591,II.,"For from that height to which with toil we climb,"
1592,II.,"From that we fall and to the further pit,"
1593,II.,Who honour bore and lost. This is my crime
1594,II.,And this the daily punishment of it:--
1595,II.,
1596,II.,To honour honour more than e'er I did
1597,II.,"When I possessed it, to esteem the lot"
1598,II.,Of those whose treasure from themselves lies hid
1599,II.,Or those who lose it and yet miss it not.

1609,III.,Save Courage at least glance of Honour's eye.
1610,III.,"For Honour, daughter of sound brain and blood,"
1611,III.,Motions us ever though we may not heed;
1612,III.,"She is imperative hunger for the good,"
1613,III.,Good so instinctive that to gain we bleed.
1614,III.,
1615,III.,"Wherefore, dishonoured soul, part from thy love--"
1616,III.,Fearfuller wrench than muscle torn from bone--
1617,III.,Or her soul too must perish here. Enough!

1628,IV.,"Memory each to each, love's last reward."
1629,IV.,But of their love maybe a fiercer glow
1630,IV.,They had who saved their honour at the last
1631,IV.,"By direst means. Whether it be or no,"
1632,IV.,In death their faces held a _something_ fast.
1633,IV.,
