36,PREFATORY NOTE,
37,PREFATORY NOTE,The object of 'Georgian Poetry' 1911-1912 was to give a convenient
38,PREFATORY NOTE,survey of the work published within two years by some poets of the newer
39,PREFATORY NOTE,"generation. The book was welcomed; and perhaps, even in a time like"
40,PREFATORY NOTE,"this, those whom it interested may care to have a corresponding volume"
41,PREFATORY NOTE,for the three years which have since passed.
42,PREFATORY NOTE,
43,PREFATORY NOTE,"Two of the poets--I think the youngest, and certainly not the least"
44,PREFATORY NOTE,"gifted--are dead. Rupert Brooke, who seemed to have everything that is"
45,PREFATORY NOTE,"worth having, died last April in the service of his country. James Elroy"
46,PREFATORY NOTE,"Flecker, to whom life and death were less generous, died in January"
47,PREFATORY NOTE,after a long and disabling illness.
48,PREFATORY NOTE,
49,PREFATORY NOTE,A few of the contributors to the former volume are not represented in
50,PREFATORY NOTE,"this one, either because they have published nothing which comes within"
51,PREFATORY NOTE,"its scope, or because they belong in fact to an earlier poetic"
52,PREFATORY NOTE,"generation, and their inclusion must be allowed to have been an"
53,PREFATORY NOTE,anachronism. Two names are added.
54,PREFATORY NOTE,
55,PREFATORY NOTE,The alphabetical arrangement of the writers has been modified in order
56,PREFATORY NOTE,to recognize the honour which Mr Gordon Bottomley has done to the book
57,PREFATORY NOTE,by allowing his play to be first published here.
58,PREFATORY NOTE,
59,PREFATORY NOTE,"My thanks for permission to print the poems are due to Messrs Constable,"
60,PREFATORY NOTE,"Duckworth, Heinemann, Herbert Jenkins, Macmillan, Elkin Mathews,"
61,PREFATORY NOTE,"Methuen, Martin Seeker, and Sidgwick and Jackson; and to the Editors of"
62,PREFATORY NOTE,"'Country Life', the 'English Review, Flying Fame, New Numbers', the 'New"
63,PREFATORY NOTE,"Statesman', and the 'Westminster Gazette'."

223,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
224,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
225,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,[The scene is a bedchamber in a one-storied house. The walls consist of
226,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,a few courses of huge irregular boulders roughly squared and fitted
227,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,together; a thatched roof rises steeply from the back wall. In the
228,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,centre of the back wall is a doorway opening on a garden and covered by
229,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,two leather curtains; the chamber is partially hung with similar
230,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,hangings stitched with bright wools. There is a small window on each
231,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,side of this door.
232,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
233,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Toward the front a bed stands with its head against the right wall; it
234,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,has thin leather curtains hung by thongs and drawn back. Farther forward
235,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,a rich robe and a crown hang on a peg in the same wall. There is a
236,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"second door beyond the bed, and between this and the bed's head stands a"
237,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"small table with a bronze lamp and a bronze cup on it. Queen HYGD, an"
238,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"emaciated woman, is asleep in the bed; her plenteous black hair, veined"
239,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"with silver, spreads over the pillow. Her waiting-woman, MERRYN,"
240,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"middle-aged and hard-featured, sits watching her in a chair on the"
241,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,farther side of the bed. The light of early morning fills the room.]
242,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
243,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
244,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Merryn:
245,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
246,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Many, many must die who long to live,"
247,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Yet this one cannot die who longs to die:
248,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Even her sleep, come now at last, thwarts death,"
249,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Although sleep lures us all half way to death ...
250,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I could not sit beside her every night
251,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,If I believed that I might suffer so:
252,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"I am sure I am not made to be diseased,"
253,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I feel there is no malady can touch me--
254,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Save the red cancer, growing where it will."
255,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
256,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
257,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"[Taking her beads from her girdle, she kneels at the foot of the bed.]"
258,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
259,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
260,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"O sweet Saint Cleer, and sweet Saint Elid too,"
261,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Shield me from rooting cancers and from madness:
262,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Shield me from sudden death, worse than two death-beds;"
263,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Let me not lie like this unwanted queen,"
264,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Yet let my time come not ere I am ready--
265,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Grant space enow to relish the watchers' tears
266,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And give my clothes away and calm my features
267,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"And streek my limbs according to my will,"
268,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Not the hard will of fumbling corpse-washers.
269,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
270,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
271,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,[She prays silently.]
272,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
273,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"[KING LEAR, a great, golden-bearded man in the full maturity of life,"
274,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"enters abruptly by the door beyond the bed, followed by the PHYSICIAN.]"
275,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
276,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
277,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Lear:
278,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
279,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Why are you here? Are you here for ever?
280,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Where is the young Scotswoman? Where is she?
281,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
282,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
283,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Merryn:
284,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
285,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"O, Sire, move softly; the Queen sleeps at last."
286,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
287,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
288,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Lear (continuing in an undertone):
289,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
290,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Where is the young Scotswoman? Where is Gormflaith?
291,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,It is her watch ... I know; I have marked your hours.
292,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Did the Queen send her away? Did the Queen
293,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Bid you stay near her in her hate of Gormflaith?
294,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,You work upon her yeasting brain to think
295,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,That she's not safe except when you crouch near her
296,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,To spy with your dropt eyes and soundless presence.
297,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
298,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
299,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Merryn:
300,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
301,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Sire, midnight should have ended Gormflaith's watch,"
302,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,But Gormflaith had another kind of will
303,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"And ended at a godlier hour by slumber,"
304,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"A letter in her hand, the night-lamp out."
305,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,She loitered in the hall when she should sleep.
306,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,My duty has two hours ere she returns.
307,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
308,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
309,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Lear:
310,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
311,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"The Queen should have young women about her bed,"
312,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Fresh cool-breathed women to lie down at her side
313,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And plenish her with vigour; for sick or wasted women
314,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Can draw a virtue from such abounding presence,"
315,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"When night makes life unwary and looses the strings of being,"
316,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Even by the breath, and most of all by sleep."
317,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Her slumber was then no fault: go you and find her.
318,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
319,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
320,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Physician:
321,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
322,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,It is not strange that a bought watcher drowses;
323,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,What is most strange is that the Queen sleeps
324,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Who would not sleep for all my draughts of sleep
325,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,In the last days. When did this change appear?
326,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
327,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
328,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Merryn:
329,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
330,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,We shall not know--it came while Gormflaith nodded.
331,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,When I awoke her and she saw the Queen
332,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,She could not speak for fear:
333,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,When the rekindling lamp showed certainly
334,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"The bed-clothes stirring about our lady's neck,"
335,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"She knew there was no death, she breathed, she said"
336,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,She had not slept until her mistress slept
337,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And lulled her; but I asked her how her mistress
338,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Slept, and her utterance faded."
339,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"She should be blamed with rods, as I was blamed"
340,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"For slumber, after a day and a night of watching,"
341,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"By the Queen's child-bed, twenty years ago."
342,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
343,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
344,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Lear:
345,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,She does what she must do: let her alone.
346,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I know her watch is now: get gone and send her.
347,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
348,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
349,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,[MERRYN goes out by the door beyond the bed.]
350,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
351,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Is it a portent now to sleep at night?
352,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,What change is here? What see you in the Queen?
353,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Can you discern how this disease will end?
354,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
355,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
356,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Physician:
357,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
358,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Surmise might spring and healing follow yet,"
359,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,If I could find a trouble that could heal;
360,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,But these strong inward pains that keep her ebbing
361,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Have not their source in perishing flesh.
362,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I have seen women creep into their beds
363,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And sink with this blind pain because they nursed
364,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Some bitterness or burden in the mind
365,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"That drew the life, sucklings too long at breast."
366,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Do you know such a cause in this poor lady?
367,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
368,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
369,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Lear:
370,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
371,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,There is no cause. How should there be a cause?
372,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
373,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
374,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Physician:
375,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
376,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,We cannot die wholly against our wills;
377,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And in the texture of women I have found
378,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Harder determination than in men:
379,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"The body grows impatient of enduring,"
380,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"The harried mind is from the body estranged,"
381,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"And we consent to go: by the Queen's touch,"
382,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"The way she moves--or does not move--in bed,"
383,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"The eyes so cold and keen in her white mask,"
384,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I know she has consented.
385,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"The snarling look of a mute wounded hawk,"
386,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"That would be let alone, is always hers--"
387,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Yet she was sorely tender: it may be
388,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Some wound in her affection will not heal.
389,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,We should be careful--the mind can so be hurt
390,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,That nought can make it be unhurt again.
391,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Where, then, did her affection most persist?"
392,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
393,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
394,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Lear:
395,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
396,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Old bone-patcher, old digger in men's flesh,"
397,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Doctors are ever itching to be priests,"
398,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Meddling in conduct, natures, life's privacies."
399,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"We have been coupled now for twenty years,"
400,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And she has never turned from me an hour--
401,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,She knows a woman's duty and a queen's:
402,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Whose, then, can her affection be but mine?"
403,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,How can I hurt her--she is still my queen?
404,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,If her strong inward pain is a real pain
405,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Find me some certain drug to medicine it:
406,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"When common beings have decayed past help,"
407,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,There must be still some drug for a king to use;
408,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,For nothing ought to be denied to kings.
409,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
410,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
411,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Physician:
412,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
413,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,For the mere anguish there is such a potion.
414,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,The gum of warpy juniper shoots is seethed
415,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,With the torn marrow of an adder's spine;
416,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,An unflawed emerald is pashed to dust
417,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And mingled there; that broth must cool in moonlight.
418,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"I have indeed attempted this already,"
419,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,But the poor emeralds I could extort
420,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,From wry-mouthed earls' women had no force.
421,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,In two more dawns it will be late for potions ...
422,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"There are not many emeralds in Britain,"
423,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And there is none for vividness and strength
424,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Like the great stone that hangs upon your breast:
425,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,If you will waste it for her she shall be holpen.
426,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
427,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
428,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Lear (with rising voice):
429,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Shatter my emerald? My emerald? My emerald?
430,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,A High King of Eire gave it to his daughter
431,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Who mothered generations of us, the kings of Britain;"
432,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,It has a spiritual influence; its heart
433,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Burns when it sees the sun ... Shatter my emerald!
434,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Only the fungused brain and carious mouth
435,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Of senile things could shape such thought ...
436,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,My emerald!
437,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
438,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
439,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,[HYGD stirs uneasily in her sleep.]
440,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,

442,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Physician:
443,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
444,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Speak lower, low; for your good fame, speak low--"
445,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,If she should waken thus ...
446,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
447,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
448,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Lear:
449,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
450,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,There is no wise man
451,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Believes that medicine is in a jewel.
452,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,It is enough that you have failed with one.
453,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Seek you a common stone. I'll not do it.
454,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Let her eat heartily: she is spent with fasting.
455,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Let her stand up and walk: she is so still
456,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Her blood can never nourish her. Come away.
457,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
458,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
459,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Physician:
460,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
461,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I must not leave her ere the woman comes--
462,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Or will some other woman ...
463,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
464,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
465,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Lear:
466,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
467,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"No, no, no, no;"
468,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,The Queen is not herself; she speaks without sense;
469,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Only Merryn and Gormflaith understand.
470,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,She is better quiet. Come ...
471,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
472,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
473,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,[He urges the PHYSICIAN roughly away by the shoulder.]
474,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
475,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,My emerald!
476,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
477,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,[He follows the PHTSICIAN out by the door at the back.
478,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Queen HYGD awakes at his last noisy words as he disappears.]
479,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
480,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
481,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Hygd:
482,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
483,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I have not slept; I did but close mine eyes
484,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,A little while--a little while forgetting ...
485,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Where are you, Merryn? ... Ah, it is not Merryn ..."
486,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Bring me the cup of whey, woman; I thirst ..."
487,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Will you speak to me if I say your name?
488,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Will you not listen, Gormflaith? ... Can you hear?"
489,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I am very thirsty--let me drink ...
490,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Ah, wicked woman, why did I speak to you?"
491,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I will not be your suppliant again ...
492,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Where are you? O, where are you? ... Where are you?"

494,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
495,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"[She tries to raise herself to look about the room, but sinks back"
496,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"helplessly. The curtains of the door at the back are parted, and GONERIL"
497,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"appears in hunting dress,--her kirtle caught up in her girdle, a light"
498,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"spear over her shoulder--stands there a moment, then enters noiselessly"
499,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"and, approaches the bed. She is a girl just turning to woman-hood, proud"
500,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"in her poise, swift and cold, an almost gleaming presence, a virgin"
501,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,huntress.]
502,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,

505,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
506,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Mother, were you calling?"
507,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Have I awakened you?
508,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,They said that you were sleeping.
509,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Why are you left alone, mother, my dear one?"
510,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
511,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
512,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Hygd:
513,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
514,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Who are you? No, no, no! Stand farther off!"
515,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,You pulse and glow; you are too vital; your presence hurts ...
516,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Freshness of hill-swards, wind and trodden ling,"
517,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I should have known that Goneril stands here.
518,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"It is yet dawn, but you have been afoot"
519,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Afar and long: where could you climb so soon?
520,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,

523,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
524,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Dearest, I am an evil daughter to you:"
525,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"I never thought of you--O, never once--"
526,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Until I heard a moor-bird cry like you.
527,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"I am wicked, rapt in joys of breath and life,"
528,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And I must force myself to think of you.
529,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I leave you to caretakers' cold gentleness;
530,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"But O, I did not think that they dare leave you."
531,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,What woman should be here?
532,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
533,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
534,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Hygd:
535,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
536,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I have forgot ...
537,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I know not ... She will be about some duty.
538,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I do not matter: my time is done ... nigh done ...
539,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Bought hands can well prepare me for a grave,"
540,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And all the generations must serve youth.
541,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"My girls shall live untroubled while they may,"
542,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And learn happiness once while yet blind men
543,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Have injured not their freedom;
544,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,For women are not meant for happiness.
545,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Where have you been, my falcon?"
546,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
547,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
548,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Goneril:
549,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,
550,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"I dreamt that I was swimming, shoulder up,"
551,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And drave the bed-clothes spreading to the floor:
552,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Coldness awoke me; through the waning darkness
553,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"I heard far hounds give shivering aery tongue,"
554,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Remote, withdrawing, suddenly faint and near;"
555,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I leapt and saw a pack of stretching weasels
556,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Hunt a pale coney in a soundless rush,"
557,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Their elfin and thin yelping pierced my heart
558,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,As with an unseen beauty long awaited;
559,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Wolf-skin and cloak I buckled over this night-gear,"
560,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And took my honoured spear from my bed-side
561,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Where none but I may touch its purity,"
562,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And sped as lightly down the dewy bank
563,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,As any mothy owl that hunts quick mice.
564,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"They went crying, crying, but I lost them"
565,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Before I stept, with the first tips of light,"
566,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,On Raven Crag near by the Druid Stones;
567,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"So I paused there and, stooping, pressed my hand"
568,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Against the stony bed of the clear stream;
569,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Then entered I the circle and raised up
570,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,My shining hand in cold stern adoration
571,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Even as the first great gleam went up the sky.

577,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Life is free to the quick up in the wind,"
578,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And the wind bares you for a god's descent--
579,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,For wind is a spirit immediate and aged.
580,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"And you do well to worship harsh men-gods,"
581,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,God Wind and Those who built his Stones with him:
582,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"All gods are cruel, bitter, and to be bribed,"
583,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,But women-gods are mean and cunning as well.
584,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"That fierce old virgin, Cornish Merryn, prays"
585,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"To a young woman, yes and even a virgin--"
586,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,The poorest kind of woman--and she says
587,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,That is to be a Christian: avoid then
588,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Her worship most, for men hate such denials,"
589,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And any woman scorns her unwed daughter.
590,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Where sped you from that height? Did Regan join you there?
591,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,

593,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Goneril:

596,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,The sweaty half-clad cook-maids render lard
597,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Out in the scullery, after pig-killing,"
598,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"And Regan sidles among their greasy skirts,"
599,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Smeary and hot as they, for craps to suck."
600,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I lost my thoughts before the giant Stones ...
601,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And when anew the earth assembled round me
602,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I swung out on the heath and woke a hare
603,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"And speared it at a cast and shouldered it,"
604,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Startled another drinking at a tarn
605,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And speared it ere it leapt; so steady and clear
606,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Had the god in his fastness made my mind.
607,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Then, as I took those dead things in my hands,"
608,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"I felt shame light my face from deep within,"
609,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"And loathing and contempt shake in my bowels,"
610,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,That such unclean coarse blows from me had issued
611,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,To crush delicate things to bloody mash
612,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And blemish their fur when I would only kill.
613,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,My gladness left me; I careered no more
614,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Upon the morning; I went down from there
615,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,With empty hands:
616,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,But under the first trees and without thought
617,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,I stole on conies at play and stooped at one;
618,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"I hunted it, I caught it up to me"
619,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"As I outsprang it, and with this thin knife"
620,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Pierced it from eye to eye; and it was dead,"
621,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"Untorn, unsullied, and with flawless fur."
622,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Then my untroubled mind came back to me.

631,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,Only to recognise our natures' joys

647,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And give yourself with the high heart of youth
648,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,More lavishly than a queen gives anything.
649,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,But when a woman gives herself
650,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,She must give herself for ever and have faith;
651,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"For woman is a thing of a season of years,"
652,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"She is an early fruit that will not keep,"

654,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,To hope for reverence for what has been;
655,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"While man renews himself into old age,"
656,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,"And gives himself according to his need,"
657,KING LEAR'S WIFE.,And women more unborn than his next child

2251,THE GREAT LOVER,THE GREAT LOVER
2252,THE GREAT LOVER,
2253,THE GREAT LOVER,
2254,THE GREAT LOVER,I have been so great a lover: filled my days
2255,THE GREAT LOVER,"So proudly with the splendour of Love's praise,"
2256,THE GREAT LOVER,"The pain, the calm, and the astonishment,"
2257,THE GREAT LOVER,"Desire illimitable, and still content,"
2258,THE GREAT LOVER,"And all dear names men use, to cheat despair,"
2259,THE GREAT LOVER,For the perplexed and viewless streams that bear
2260,THE GREAT LOVER,Our hearts at random down the dark of life.
2261,THE GREAT LOVER,"Now, ere the unthinking silence on that strife"
2262,THE GREAT LOVER,"Steals down, I would cheat drowsy Death so far,"
2263,THE GREAT LOVER,My night shall be remembered for a star
2264,THE GREAT LOVER,That outshone all the suns of all men's days.
2265,THE GREAT LOVER,Shall I not crown them with immortal praise
2266,THE GREAT LOVER,"Whom I have loved, who have given me, dared with me"
2267,THE GREAT LOVER,"High secrets, and in darkness knelt to see"
2268,THE GREAT LOVER,The inenarrable godhead of delight?
2269,THE GREAT LOVER,Love is a flame;--we have beaconed the world's night.
2270,THE GREAT LOVER,"A city:--and we have built it, these and I."
2271,THE GREAT LOVER,An emperor:--we have taught the world to die.
2272,THE GREAT LOVER,"So, for their sakes I loved, ere I go hence,"
2273,THE GREAT LOVER,"And the high cause of Love's magnificence,"
2274,THE GREAT LOVER,"And to keep loyalties young, I'll write those names"
2275,THE GREAT LOVER,"Golden for ever, eagles, crying flames,"
2276,THE GREAT LOVER,"And set them as a banner, that men may know,"
2277,THE GREAT LOVER,"To dare the generations, burn, and blow"
2278,THE GREAT LOVER,"Out on the wind of Time, shining and streaming ..."
2279,THE GREAT LOVER,
2280,THE GREAT LOVER,These I have loved:
2281,THE GREAT LOVER,"White plates and cups, clean-gleaming,"
2282,THE GREAT LOVER,"Ringed with blue lines; and feathery, faery dust;"
2283,THE GREAT LOVER,"Wet roofs, beneath the lamp-light; the strong crust"
2284,THE GREAT LOVER,Of friendly bread; and many-tasting food;
2285,THE GREAT LOVER,Rainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of wood;
2286,THE GREAT LOVER,And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers;
2287,THE GREAT LOVER,"And flowers themselves, that sway through sunny hours,"
2288,THE GREAT LOVER,Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon;
2289,THE GREAT LOVER,"Then, the cool kindliness of sheets, that soon"
2290,THE GREAT LOVER,Smooth away trouble; and the rough male kiss
2291,THE GREAT LOVER,Of blankets; grainy wood; live hair that is
2292,THE GREAT LOVER,Shining and free; blue-massing clouds; the keen
2293,THE GREAT LOVER,Unpassioned beauty of a great machine;
2294,THE GREAT LOVER,The benison of hot water; furs to touch;
2295,THE GREAT LOVER,The good smell of old clothes; and other such--
2296,THE GREAT LOVER,"The comfortable smell of friendly fingers,"
2297,THE GREAT LOVER,"Hair's fragrance, and the musty reek that lingers"
2298,THE GREAT LOVER,About dead leaves and last year's ferns ...
2299,THE GREAT LOVER,"Dear names,"
2300,THE GREAT LOVER,And thousand other throng to me! Royal flames;
2301,THE GREAT LOVER,Sweet water's dimpling laugh from tap or spring;
2302,THE GREAT LOVER,Holes in the ground; and voices that do sing;
2303,THE GREAT LOVER,"Voices in laughter, too; and body's pain,"
2304,THE GREAT LOVER,Soon turned to peace; and the deep-panting train;
2305,THE GREAT LOVER,Firm sands; the little dulling edge of foam
2306,THE GREAT LOVER,That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home;
2307,THE GREAT LOVER,"And washen stones, gay for an hour; the cold"
2308,THE GREAT LOVER,Graveness of iron; moist black earthen mould;
2309,THE GREAT LOVER,Sleep; and high places; footprints in the dew;
2310,THE GREAT LOVER,"And oaks; and brown horse-chestnuts, glossy-new;"
2311,THE GREAT LOVER,And new-peeled sticks; and shining pools on grass;--
2312,THE GREAT LOVER,"All these have been my loves. And these shall pass,"
2313,THE GREAT LOVER,"Whatever passes not, in the great hour,"
2314,THE GREAT LOVER,"Nor all my passion, all my prayers, have power"
2315,THE GREAT LOVER,To hold them with me through the gate of Death.
2316,THE GREAT LOVER,"They'll play deserter, turn with the traitor breath,"
2317,THE GREAT LOVER,"Break the high bond we made, and sell Love's trust"
2318,THE GREAT LOVER,And sacramented covenant to the dust.
2319,THE GREAT LOVER,"--Oh, never a doubt but, somewhere, I shall wake,"
2320,THE GREAT LOVER,"And give what's left of love again, and make"
2321,THE GREAT LOVER,"New friends, now strangers..."
2322,THE GREAT LOVER,"But the best I've known,"
2323,THE GREAT LOVER,"Stays here, and changes, breaks, grows old, is blown"
2324,THE GREAT LOVER,"About the winds of the world, and fades from brains"
2325,THE GREAT LOVER,"Of living men, and dies."
2326,THE GREAT LOVER,Nothing remains.
2327,THE GREAT LOVER,
2328,THE GREAT LOVER,"O dear my loves, O faithless, once again"
2329,THE GREAT LOVER,This one last gift I give: that after men
2330,THE GREAT LOVER,"Shall know, and later lovers, far-removed,"
2331,THE GREAT LOVER,"Praise you, 'All these were lovely'; say, 'He loved.'"

2876,OFF THE GROUND,"Seven fine churches,"
2877,OFF THE GROUND,"And five old mills,"
2878,OFF THE GROUND,"Farms in the valley,"
2879,OFF THE GROUND,And sheep on the hills;

2882,OFF THE GROUND,"All left behind,"
2883,OFF THE GROUND,As they danced through Wool.
2884,OFF THE GROUND,"And Wool gone by,"
2885,OFF THE GROUND,Like tops that seem
2886,OFF THE GROUND,To spin in sleep
2887,OFF THE GROUND,They danced in dream:
2888,OFF THE GROUND,Withy--Wellover--
2889,OFF THE GROUND,Wassop--Wo--
2890,OFF THE GROUND,Like an old clock
2891,OFF THE GROUND,Their heels did go.
2892,OFF THE GROUND,A league and a league
2893,OFF THE GROUND,"And a league they went,"
2894,OFF THE GROUND,"And not one weary,"
2895,OFF THE GROUND,And not one spent.
2896,OFF THE GROUND,"And lo, and behold!"
2897,OFF THE GROUND,Past Willow-cum-Leigh
2898,OFF THE GROUND,Stretched with its waters
2899,OFF THE GROUND,The great green sea.
2900,OFF THE GROUND,"Says Farmer Bates,"

2909,OFF THE GROUND,"On twirling toes,"
2910,OFF THE GROUND,"Up's with his gaiters,"
2911,OFF THE GROUND,And in he goes:
2912,OFF THE GROUND,Down where the mermaids
2913,OFF THE GROUND,Pluck and play
2914,OFF THE GROUND,On their twangling harps
2915,OFF THE GROUND,In a sea-green day;
2916,OFF THE GROUND,"Down where the mermaids,"
2917,OFF THE GROUND,"Finned and fair,"
2918,OFF THE GROUND,Sleek with their combs
2919,OFF THE GROUND,Their yellow hair ...
2920,OFF THE GROUND,Bates and Giles--
2921,OFF THE GROUND,"On the shingle sat,"
2922,OFF THE GROUND,Gazing at Turvey's
2923,OFF THE GROUND,Floating hat.
2924,OFF THE GROUND,But never a ripple
2925,OFF THE GROUND,Nor bubble told
2926,OFF THE GROUND,Where he was supping
2927,OFF THE GROUND,Off plates of gold.
2928,OFF THE GROUND,Never an echo
2929,OFF THE GROUND,Rilled through the sea
2930,OFF THE GROUND,Of the feasting and dancing
2931,OFF THE GROUND,And minstrelsy.
2932,OFF THE GROUND,They called--called--called:
2933,OFF THE GROUND,Came no reply:
2934,OFF THE GROUND,Nought but the ripples'
2935,OFF THE GROUND,Sandy sigh.
2936,OFF THE GROUND,Then glum and silent
2937,OFF THE GROUND,"They sat instead,"
2938,OFF THE GROUND,Vacantly brooding
2939,OFF THE GROUND,"On home and bed,"
2940,OFF THE GROUND,Till both together
2941,OFF THE GROUND,Stood up and said:--
2942,OFF THE GROUND,"'Us knows not, dreams not,"
2943,OFF THE GROUND,"Where you be,"
2944,OFF THE GROUND,"Turvey, unless"
2945,OFF THE GROUND,In the deep blue sea;

2972,A TOWN WINDOW,As over Warwick woods are sweet.
2973,A TOWN WINDOW,
2974,A TOWN WINDOW,Under the grey drift of the town
2975,A TOWN WINDOW,The crocus works among the mould

2991,OF GREATHAM,"Into your Sussex quietness I came,"

2993,OF GREATHAM,Over the world in flame.

2995,OF GREATHAM,"And peace upon your pasture-lands I found,"

3005,OF GREATHAM,Under the calm ascension of the night
3006,OF GREATHAM,We heard the mellow lapsing and return

3034,THE CARVER IN STONE,THE CARVER IN STONE
3035,THE CARVER IN STONE,
3036,THE CARVER IN STONE,"He was a man with wide and patient eyes,"
3037,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Grey, like the drift of twitch-fires blown in June,"
3038,THE CARVER IN STONE,"That, without fearing, searched if any wrong"
3039,THE CARVER IN STONE,Might threaten from your heart. Grey eyes he had
3040,THE CARVER IN STONE,Under a brow was drawn because he knew
3041,THE CARVER IN STONE,So many seasons to so many pass
3042,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of upright service, loyal, unabased"
3043,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Before the world seducing, and so, barren"
3044,THE CARVER IN STONE,Of good words praising and thought that mated his.
3045,THE CARVER IN STONE,He carved in stone. Out of his quiet life
3046,THE CARVER IN STONE,He watched as any faithful seaman charged
3047,THE CARVER IN STONE,"With tidings of the myriad faring sea,"
3048,THE CARVER IN STONE,And thoughts and premonitions through his mind
3049,THE CARVER IN STONE,Sailing as ships from strange and storied lands
3050,THE CARVER IN STONE,"His hungry spirit held, till all they were"
3051,THE CARVER IN STONE,Found living witness in the chiselled stone.
3052,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Slowly out of the dark confusion, spread"
3053,THE CARVER IN STONE,By life's innumerable venturings
3054,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Over his brain, he would triumph into the light"
3055,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of one clear mood, unblemished of the blind"
3056,THE CARVER IN STONE,Legions of errant thought that cried about
3057,THE CARVER IN STONE,"His rapt seclusion: as a pearl unsoiled,"
3058,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Nay, rather washed to lonelier chastity,"
3059,THE CARVER IN STONE,"In gritty mud. And then would come a bird,"
3060,THE CARVER IN STONE,"A flower, or the wind moving upon a flower,"
3061,THE CARVER IN STONE,"A beast at pasture, or a clustered fruit,"
3062,THE CARVER IN STONE,"A peasant face as were the saints of old,"
3063,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The leer of custom, or the bow of the moon"
3064,THE CARVER IN STONE,Swung in miraculous poise--some stray from the world
3065,THE CARVER IN STONE,Of things created by the eternal mind
3066,THE CARVER IN STONE,In joy articulate. And his perfect mood
3067,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Would dwell about the token of God's mood,"
3068,THE CARVER IN STONE,Until in bird or flower or moving wind
3069,THE CARVER IN STONE,Or flock or shepherd or the troops of heaven
3070,THE CARVER IN STONE,It sprang in one fierce moment of desire
3071,THE CARVER IN STONE,To visible form.
3072,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Then would his chisel work among the stone,"
3073,THE CARVER IN STONE,Persuading it of petal or of limb
3074,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Or starry curve, till risen anew there sang"
3075,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Shape out of chaos, and again the vision"
3076,THE CARVER IN STONE,Of one mind single from the world was pressed
3077,THE CARVER IN STONE,Upon the daily custom of the sky
3078,THE CARVER IN STONE,Or field or the body of man.
3079,THE CARVER IN STONE,His people
3080,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Had many gods for worship. The tiger-god,"
3081,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The owl, the dewlapped bull, the running pard,"
3082,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The camel, and the lizard of the slime,"
3083,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The ram with quivering fleece and fluted horn,"
3084,THE CARVER IN STONE,The crested eagle and the doming bat
3085,THE CARVER IN STONE,Were sacred. And the king and his high priests
3086,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Decreed a temple, wide on columns huge,"
3087,THE CARVER IN STONE,Should top the cornlands to the sky's far line.
3088,THE CARVER IN STONE,They bade the carvers carve along the walls
3089,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Images of their gods, each one to carve"
3090,THE CARVER IN STONE,"As he desired, his choice to name his god ..."
3091,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And many came; and he among them, glad"
3092,THE CARVER IN STONE,Of three leagues' travel through the singing air
3093,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of dawn among the boughs yet bare of green,"
3094,THE CARVER IN STONE,The eager flight of the spring leading his blood
3095,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Into swift lofty channels of the air,"
3096,THE CARVER IN STONE,Proud as an eagle riding to the sun ...
3097,THE CARVER IN STONE,"An eagle, clean of pinion--there's his choice."
3098,THE CARVER IN STONE,
3099,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Daylong they worked under the growing roof,"
3100,THE CARVER IN STONE,"One at his leopard, one the staring ram,"
3101,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And he winning his eagle from the stone,"
3102,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Until each man had carved one image out,"
3103,THE CARVER IN STONE,Arow beyond the portal of the house.
3104,THE CARVER IN STONE,
3105,THE CARVER IN STONE,"They stood arow, the company of gods,"
3106,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Camel and bat, lizard and bull and ram,"
3107,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The pard and owl, dead figures on the wall,"
3108,THE CARVER IN STONE,Figures of habit driven on the stone
3109,THE CARVER IN STONE,By chisels governed by no heat of the brain
3110,THE CARVER IN STONE,But drudges of hands that moved by easy rule.
3111,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Proudly recorded mood was none, no thought"
3112,THE CARVER IN STONE,Plucked from the dark battalions of the mind
3113,THE CARVER IN STONE,And throned in everlasting sight. But one
3114,THE CARVER IN STONE,God of them all was witness of belief
3115,THE CARVER IN STONE,And large adventure dared. His eagle spread
3116,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Wide pinions on a cloudless ground of heaven,"
3117,THE CARVER IN STONE,Glad with the heart's high courage of that dawn
3118,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Moving upon the ploughlands newly sown,"
3119,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Dead stone the rest. He looked, and knew it so."
3120,THE CARVER IN STONE,
3121,THE CARVER IN STONE,Then came the king with priests and counsellors
3122,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And many chosen of the people, wise"
3123,THE CARVER IN STONE,"With words weary of custom, and eyes askew"
3124,THE CARVER IN STONE,That watched their neighbour face for any news
3125,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of the best way of judgment, till, each sure"
3126,THE CARVER IN STONE,"None would determine with authority,"
3127,THE CARVER IN STONE,All spoke in prudent praise. One liked the owl
3128,THE CARVER IN STONE,Because an owl blinked on the beam of his barn.
3129,THE CARVER IN STONE,"One, hoarse with crying gospels in the street,"
3130,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Praised most the ram, because the common folk"
3131,THE CARVER IN STONE,Wore breeches made of ram's wool. One declared
3132,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The tiger pleased him best,--the man who carved"
3133,THE CARVER IN STONE,The tiger-god was halt out of the womb--
3134,THE CARVER IN STONE,"A man to praise, being so pitiful."
3135,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And one, whose eyes dwelt in a distant void,"
3136,THE CARVER IN STONE,"With spell and omen pat upon his lips,"
3137,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And a purse for any crystal prophet ripe,"
3138,THE CARVER IN STONE,"A zealot of the mist, gazed at the bull--"
3139,THE CARVER IN STONE,A lean ill-shapen bull of meagre lines
3140,THE CARVER IN STONE,That scarce the steel had graved upon the stone--
3141,THE CARVER IN STONE,Saying that here was very mystery
3142,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And truth, did men but know. And one there was"
3143,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Who praised his eagle, but remembering"
3144,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The lither pinion of the swift, the curve"
3145,THE CARVER IN STONE,That liked him better of the mirrored swan.
3146,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And they who carved the tiger-god and ram,"
3147,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The camel and the pard, the owl and bull,"
3148,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And lizard, listened greedily, and made"
3149,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Humble denial of their worthiness,"
3150,THE CARVER IN STONE,And when the king his royal judgment gave
3151,THE CARVER IN STONE,"That all had fashioned well, and bade that each"
3152,THE CARVER IN STONE,Re-shape his chosen god along the walls
3153,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Till all the temple boasted of their skill,"
3154,THE CARVER IN STONE,They bowed themselves in token that as this
3155,THE CARVER IN STONE,Never had carvers been so fortunate.
3156,THE CARVER IN STONE,
3157,THE CARVER IN STONE,Only the man with wide and patient eyes
3158,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Made no denial, neither bowed his head."
3159,THE CARVER IN STONE,Already while they spoke his thoughts had gone
3160,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Far from his eagle, leaving it for a sign"
3161,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Loyally wrought of one deep breath of life,"
3162,THE CARVER IN STONE,And played about the image of a toad
3163,THE CARVER IN STONE,That crawled among his ivy leaves. A queer
3164,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Puff-bellied toad, with eyes that always stared"
3165,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Sidelong at heaven and saw no heaven there,"
3166,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Weak-hammed, and with a throttle somehow twisted"
3167,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Beyond full wholesome draughts of air, and skin"
3168,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of wrinkled lips, the only zest or will"
3169,THE CARVER IN STONE,The little flashing tongue searching the leaves.
3170,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And king and priest, chosen and counsellor,"
3171,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Babbling out of their thin and jealous brains,"
3172,THE CARVER IN STONE,Seemed strangely one; a queer enormous toad
3173,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Panting under giant leaves of dark,"
3174,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Sunk in the loins, peering into the day."
3175,THE CARVER IN STONE,
3176,THE CARVER IN STONE,Their judgment wry he counted not for wrong
3177,THE CARVER IN STONE,More than the fabled poison of the toad
3178,THE CARVER IN STONE,Striking at simple wits; how should their thought
3179,THE CARVER IN STONE,Or word in praise or blame come near the peace
3180,THE CARVER IN STONE,That shone in seasonable hours above
3181,THE CARVER IN STONE,The patience of his spirit's husbandry?
3182,THE CARVER IN STONE,"They foolish and not seeing, how should he"
3183,THE CARVER IN STONE,Spend anger there or fear--great ceremonies
3184,THE CARVER IN STONE,Equal for none save great antagonists?
3185,THE CARVER IN STONE,The grave indifference of his heart before them
3186,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Was moved by laughter innocent of hate,"
3187,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Chastising clean of spite, that moulded them"
3188,THE CARVER IN STONE,Into the antic likeness of his toad
3189,THE CARVER IN STONE,Bidding for laughter underneath the leaves.
3190,THE CARVER IN STONE,
3191,THE CARVER IN STONE,"He bowed not, nor disputed, but he saw"
3192,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Those ill-created joyless gods, and loathed,"
3193,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And saw them creeping, creeping round the walls,"
3194,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Death breeding death, wile witnessing to wile,"
3195,THE CARVER IN STONE,And sickened at the dull iniquity
3196,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Should be rewarded, and for ever breathe"
3197,THE CARVER IN STONE,Contagion on the folk gathered in prayer.
3198,THE CARVER IN STONE,His truth should not be doomed to march among
3199,THE CARVER IN STONE,"This falsehood to the ages. He was called,"
3200,THE CARVER IN STONE,And he must labour there; if so the king
3201,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Would grant it, where the pillars bore the roof"
3202,THE CARVER IN STONE,A galleried way of meditation nursed
3203,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Secluded time, with wall of ready stone"
3204,THE CARVER IN STONE,In panels for the carver set between
3205,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The windows--there his chisel should be set,--"
3206,THE CARVER IN STONE,"It was his plea. And the king spoke of him,"
3207,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Scorning, as one lack-fettle, among all these"
3208,THE CARVER IN STONE,Eager to take the riches of renown;
3209,THE CARVER IN STONE,One fearful of the light or knowing nothing
3210,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of light's dimension, a witling who would throw"
3211,THE CARVER IN STONE,Honour aside and praise spoken aloud
3212,THE CARVER IN STONE,All men of heart should covet. Let him go
3213,THE CARVER IN STONE,Grubbing out of the sight of those who knew
3214,THE CARVER IN STONE,The worth of substance; there was his proper trade.
3215,THE CARVER IN STONE,
3216,THE CARVER IN STONE,"A squat and curious toad indeed ... The eyes,"
3217,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Patient and grey, were dumb as were the lips,"
3218,THE CARVER IN STONE,"That, fixed and governed, hoarded from them all"
3219,THE CARVER IN STONE,The larger laughter lifting in his heart.
3220,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Straightway about his gallery he moved,"
3221,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Measured the windows and the virgin stone,"
3222,THE CARVER IN STONE,Till all was weighed and patterned in his brain.
3223,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Then first where most the shadows struck the wall,"
3224,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Under the sills, and centre of the base,"
3225,THE CARVER IN STONE,From floor to sill out of the stone was wooed
3226,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Memorial folly, as from the chisel leapt"
3227,THE CARVER IN STONE,His chastening laughter searching priest and king--
3228,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Huge and wrinkled toad, with legs asplay,"
3229,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And belly loaded, leering with great eyes"
3230,THE CARVER IN STONE,Busily fixed upon the void.
3231,THE CARVER IN STONE,
3232,THE CARVER IN STONE,All days
3233,THE CARVER IN STONE,His chisel was the first to ring across
3234,THE CARVER IN STONE,The temple's quiet; and at fall of dusk
3235,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Passing among the carvers homeward, they"
3236,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Would speak of him as mad, or weak against"
3237,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The challenge of the world, and let him go"
3238,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Lonely, as was his will, under the night"
3239,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of stars or cloud or summer's folded sun,"
3240,THE CARVER IN STONE,Through crop and wood and pasture-land to sleep.
3241,THE CARVER IN STONE,None took the narrow stair as wondering
3242,THE CARVER IN STONE,"How did his chisel prosper in the stone,"
3243,THE CARVER IN STONE,Unvisited his labour and forgot.
3244,THE CARVER IN STONE,And times when he would lean out of his height
3245,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And watch the gods growing along the walls,"
3246,THE CARVER IN STONE,The row of carvers in their linen coats
3247,THE CARVER IN STONE,Took in his vision a virtue that alone
3248,THE CARVER IN STONE,Carving they had not nor the thing they carved.
3249,THE CARVER IN STONE,Knowing the health that flowed about his close
3250,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Imagining, the daily quiet won"
3251,THE CARVER IN STONE,"From process of his clean and supple craft,"
3252,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Those carvers there, far on the floor below,"
3253,THE CARVER IN STONE,Would haply be transfigured in his thought
3254,THE CARVER IN STONE,Into a gallant company of men
3255,THE CARVER IN STONE,Glad of the strict and loyal reckoning
3256,THE CARVER IN STONE,That proved in the just presence of the brain
3257,THE CARVER IN STONE,Each chisel-stroke. How surely would he prosper
3258,THE CARVER IN STONE,In pleasant talk at easy hours with men
3259,THE CARVER IN STONE,So fashioned if it might be--and his eyes
3260,THE CARVER IN STONE,Would pass again to those dead gods that grew
3261,THE CARVER IN STONE,In spreading evil round the temple walls;
3262,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And, one dead pressure made, the carvers moved"
3263,THE CARVER IN STONE,Along the wall to mould and mould again

3285,THE CARVER IN STONE,"His bull, with eyes that often in the dusk"
3286,THE CARVER IN STONE,Would lift from the sweet meadow grass to watch

3298,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And there were jests, wholesome as harvest ale,"
3299,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of homely habit, bred of hearts that dared"
3300,THE CARVER IN STONE,Judgment of laughter under the eternal eye:
3301,THE CARVER IN STONE,This frolic wisdom was his carven owl.
3302,THE CARVER IN STONE,"His ram was lordship on the lonely hills,"

3306,THE CARVER IN STONE,Poorer than disinherited ghosts. His bat
3307,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Was ancient envy made a mockery,"
3308,THE CARVER IN STONE,Cowering below the newer eagle carved
3309,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Above the arches with wide pinion spread,"
3310,THE CARVER IN STONE,His faith's dominion of that happy dawn.
3311,THE CARVER IN STONE,
3312,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And so he wrought the gods upon the wall,"
3313,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Living and crying out of his desire,"
3314,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Out of his patient incorruptible thought,"

3317,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Of bluebells heavy with the news of spring,"
3318,THE CARVER IN STONE,"The vine loaded with plenty of the year,"
3319,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And swallows, merely tenderness of thought"
3320,THE CARVER IN STONE,Bidding the stone to small and fragile flight;
3321,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Leaves, the thin relics of autumnal boughs,"
3322,THE CARVER IN STONE,Or massed in June ...
3323,THE CARVER IN STONE,All from their native pressure bloomed and sprang
3324,THE CARVER IN STONE,Under his shaping hand into a proud
3325,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And governed image of the central man,--"
3326,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Their moulding, charts of all his travelling."
3327,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And all were deftly ordered, duly set"
3328,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Between the windows, underneath the sills,"
3329,THE CARVER IN STONE,"And roofward, as a motion rightly planned,"
3330,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Till on the wall, out of the sullen stone,"
3331,THE CARVER IN STONE,"A glory blazed, his vision manifest,"
3332,THE CARVER IN STONE,His wonder captive. And he was content.
3333,THE CARVER IN STONE,
3334,THE CARVER IN STONE,And when the builders and the carvers knew
3335,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Their labours done, and high the temple stood"
3336,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Over the cornlands, king and counsellor"
3337,THE CARVER IN STONE,And priest and chosen of the people came

3343,THE CARVER IN STONE,"To holy use, tribute and choral praise"
3344,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Given as was ordained, the king looked down"
3345,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Upon the gathered folk, and bade them see"

3347,THE CARVER IN STONE,And keep in honour men whose precious skill
3348,THE CARVER IN STONE,"Could so adorn the sessions of their worship,"
3349,THE CARVER IN STONE,Gravely the carvers bowed them to the ground.
3350,THE CARVER IN STONE,Only the man with wide and patient eyes
3351,THE CARVER IN STONE,Stood not among them; nor did any come
3352,THE CARVER IN STONE,"To count his labour, where he watched alone"

3703,THE GORSE,
3704,THE GORSE,"In dream, again within the clean, cold hell"
3705,THE GORSE,Of glazed and aching silence he was trapped;
3706,THE GORSE,"And, closing in, the blank walls of his cell"
3707,THE GORSE,"Crushed stifling on him ... when the bracken snapped,"
3708,THE GORSE,Caught in his clutching fingers; and he lay
3709,THE GORSE,"Awake upon his back among the fern,"
3710,THE GORSE,"With free eyes travelling the wide blue day,"
3711,THE GORSE,"Unhindered, unremembering; while a burn"
3712,THE GORSE,"Tinkled and gurgled somewhere out of sight,"
3713,THE GORSE,Unheard of him; till suddenly aware
3714,THE GORSE,"Of its cold music, shivering in the light,"
3715,THE GORSE,"He raised himself, and with far-ranging stare"
3716,THE GORSE,Looked all about him: and with dazed eyes wide
3717,THE GORSE,"Saw, still as in a numb, unreal dream,"
3718,THE GORSE,"Black figures scouring a far hill-side,"
3719,THE GORSE,With now and then a sunlit rifle's gleam;
3720,THE GORSE,And knew the hunt was hot upon his track:
3721,THE GORSE,"Yet hardly seemed to mind, somehow, just then ..."
3722,THE GORSE,But kept on wondering why they looked so black
3723,THE GORSE,"On that hot hillside, all those little men"
3724,THE GORSE,"Who scurried round like beetles--twelve, all told ..."
3725,THE GORSE,He counted them twice over; and began
3726,THE GORSE,"A third time reckoning them, but could not hold"
3727,THE GORSE,"His starved wits to the business, while they ran"
3728,THE GORSE,"So brokenly, and always stuck at 'five' ..."
3729,THE GORSE,"And 'One, two, three, four, five,' a dozen times"
3730,THE GORSE,He muttered ... 'Can you catch a fish alive?'
3731,THE GORSE,Sang mocking echoes of old nursery rhymes
3732,THE GORSE,"Through the strained, tingling hollow of his head."
3733,THE GORSE,"And now, almost remembering, he was stirred"
3734,THE GORSE,To pity them; and wondered if they'd fed
3735,THE GORSE,"Since he had, or if, ever since they'd heard"
3736,THE GORSE,Two nights ago the sudden signal-gun
3737,THE GORSE,"That raised alarm of his escape, they too"
3738,THE GORSE,"Had fasted in the wilderness, and run"
3739,THE GORSE,"With nothing but the thirsty wind to chew,"
3740,THE GORSE,And nothing in their bellies but a fill
3741,THE GORSE,"Of cold peat-water, till their heads were light ..."
3742,THE GORSE,
3743,THE GORSE,The crackling of a rifle on the hill
3744,THE GORSE,"Rang in his ears: and stung to headlong flight,"
3745,THE GORSE,He started to his feet; and through the brake
3746,THE GORSE,"He plunged in panic, heedless of the sun"
3747,THE GORSE,That burned his cropped head to a red-hot ache
3748,THE GORSE,Still racked with crackling echoes of the gun.
3749,THE GORSE,
3750,THE GORSE,Then suddenly the sun-enkindled fire
3751,THE GORSE,Of gorse upon the moor-top caught his eye:
3752,THE GORSE,"And that gold glow held all his heart's desire,"
3753,THE GORSE,"As, like a witless, flame-bewildered fly,"
3754,THE GORSE,"He blundered towards the league-wide yellow blaze,"
3755,THE GORSE,And tumbled headlong on the spikes of bloom;
3756,THE GORSE,"And rising, bruised and bleeding and adaze,"
3757,THE GORSE,"Struggled through clutching spines; the dense, sweet fume"
3758,THE GORSE,"Of nutty, acrid scent like poison stealing"
3759,THE GORSE,Through his hot blood; the bristling yellow glare
3760,THE GORSE,"Spiking his eyes with fire, till he went reeling,"
3761,THE GORSE,"Stifled and blinded, on--and did not care"
3762,THE GORSE,"Though he were taken--wandering round and round,"
3763,THE GORSE,"'Jerusalem the Golden' quavering shrill,"
3764,THE GORSE,Changing his tune to 'Tommy Tiddler's Ground':
3765,THE GORSE,"Till, just a lost child on that dazzling hill,"
3766,THE GORSE,Bewildered in a glittering golden maze
3767,THE GORSE,"Of stinging scented fire, he dropped, quite done,"
3768,THE GORSE,A shrivelling wisp within a world ablaze
3769,THE GORSE,"Beneath a blinding sky, one blaze of sun."

3778,HOOPS,[Scene: The big tent-stable of a travelling circus. On the ground near
3779,HOOPS,"the entrance GENTLEMAN JOHN, stableman and general odd-job man, lies"
3780,HOOPS,"smoking beside MERRY ANDREW, the clown. GENTLEMAN JOHN is a little"
3781,HOOPS,"hunched man with a sensitive face and dreamy eyes. MERRY ANDREW, who is"
3782,HOOPS,"resting between the afternoon and evening performances, with his clown's"
3783,HOOPS,"hat lying beside him, wears a crimson wig, and a baggy suit of"
3784,HOOPS,"orange-coloured cotton, patterned with purple cats. His face is chalked"
3785,HOOPS,"dead-white, and painted with a set grin, so that it is impossible to see"
3786,HOOPS,what manner of man he is. In the back-ground are camels and elephants
3787,HOOPS,"feeding, dimly visible in the steamy dusk of the tent.]"
3788,HOOPS,
3789,HOOPS,
3790,HOOPS,Gentleman John:
3791,HOOPS,
3792,HOOPS,And then consider camels: only think
3793,HOOPS,"Of camels long enough, and you'ld go mad--"
3794,HOOPS,"With all their humps and lumps; their knobbly knees,"
3795,HOOPS,"Splay feet, and straddle legs; their sagging necks,"
3796,HOOPS,"Flat flanks, and scraggy tails, and monstrous teeth."
3797,HOOPS,I've not forgotten the first fiend I met:
3798,HOOPS,"'Twas in a lane in Smyrna, just a ditch"
3799,HOOPS,"Between the shuttered houses, and so narrow"
3800,HOOPS,The brute's bulk blocked the road; the huge green stack
3801,HOOPS,Of dewy fodder that it slouched beneath
3802,HOOPS,"Brushing the yellow walls on either hand,"
3803,HOOPS,And shutting out the strip of burning blue:
3804,HOOPS,And I'd to face that vicious bobbing head
3805,HOOPS,"With evil eyes, slack lips, and nightmare teeth,"
3806,HOOPS,"And duck beneath the snaky, squirming neck,"
3807,HOOPS,"Pranked with its silly string of bright blue beads,"
3808,HOOPS,"That seemed to wriggle every way at once,"
3809,HOOPS,As though it were a hydra. Allah's beard!
3810,HOOPS,"But I was scared, and nearly turned and ran:"
3811,HOOPS,"I felt that muzzle take me by the scruff,"
3812,HOOPS,"And heard those murderous teeth crunching my spine,"
3813,HOOPS,Before I stooped--though I dodged safely under.
3814,HOOPS,I've always been afraid of ugliness.
3815,HOOPS,"I'm such a toad myself, I hate all toads;"
3816,HOOPS,"And the camel is the ugliest toad of all,"
3817,HOOPS,To my mind; and it's just my devil's luck
3818,HOOPS,"I've come to this--to be a camel's lackey,"
3819,HOOPS,"To fetch and carry for original sin,"
3820,HOOPS,"For sure enough, the camel's old evil incarnate."
3821,HOOPS,Blue beads and amulets to ward off evil!
3822,HOOPS,No eye's more evil than a camel's eye.
3823,HOOPS,"The elephant is quite a comely brute,"
3824,HOOPS,"Compared with Satan camel,--trunk and all,"
3825,HOOPS,"His floppy ears, and his inconsequent tail."
3826,HOOPS,"He's stolid, but at least a gentleman."
3827,HOOPS,"It doesn't hurt my pride to valet him,"
3828,HOOPS,And bring his shaving-water. He's a lord.
3829,HOOPS,Only the bluest blood that has come down
3830,HOOPS,Through generations from the mastodon
3831,HOOPS,"Could carry off that tail with dignity,"
3832,HOOPS,"That tail and trunk. He cannot look absurd,"
3833,HOOPS,"For all the monkey tricks you put him through,"
3834,HOOPS,Your paper hoops and popguns. He just makes
3835,HOOPS,"His masters look ridiculous, when his pomp's"
3836,HOOPS,Butchered to make a bumpkin's holiday.
3837,HOOPS,"He's dignity itself, and proper pride,"
3838,HOOPS,That stands serenely in a circus-world
3839,HOOPS,Of mountebanks and monkeys. He has weight
3840,HOOPS,Behind him: æons of primeval power
3841,HOOPS,"Have shaped that pillared bulk; and he stands sure,"
3842,HOOPS,"Solid, substantial on the world's foundations."
3843,HOOPS,"And he has form, form that's too big a thing"
3844,HOOPS,"To be called beauty. Once, long since, I thought"
3845,HOOPS,"To be a poet, and shape words, and mould"
3846,HOOPS,"A poem like an elephant, huge, sublime,"
3847,HOOPS,"To front oblivion; and because I failed,"
3848,HOOPS,"And all my rhymes were gawky, shambling camels,"
3849,HOOPS,"Or else obscene, blue-buttocked apes, I'm doomed"
3850,HOOPS,"To lackey it for things such as I've made,"
3851,HOOPS,"Till one of them crunches my backbone with his teeth,"
3852,HOOPS,Or knocks my wind out with a forthright kick
3853,HOOPS,"Clean in the midriff, crumpling up in death"
3854,HOOPS,The hunched and stunted body that was me--
3855,HOOPS,"John, the apostle of the Perfect Form!"
3856,HOOPS,Jerusalem! I'm talking like a book--
3857,HOOPS,"As you would say: and a bad book at that,"
3858,HOOPS,"A maundering, kiss-mammy book--The Hunch-back's End"
3859,HOOPS,Or The Camel-Keeper's Reward--would be its title.
3860,HOOPS,I froth and bubble like a new-broached cask.
3861,HOOPS,"No wonder you look glum, for all your grin."
3862,HOOPS,What makes you mope? You've naught to growse about.
3863,HOOPS,You've got no hump. Your body's brave and straight--
3864,HOOPS,So shapely even that you can afford
3865,HOOPS,"To trick it in fantastic shapelessness,"
3866,HOOPS,Knowing that there's a clean-limbed man beneath
3867,HOOPS,Preposterous pantaloons and purple cats.
3868,HOOPS,"I would have been a poet, if I could:"
3869,HOOPS,But better than shaping poems 'twould have been
3870,HOOPS,To have had a comely body and clean limbs
3871,HOOPS,Obedient to my bidding.
3872,HOOPS,
3873,HOOPS,
3874,HOOPS,Merry Andrew:
3875,HOOPS,
3876,HOOPS,I missed a hoop
3877,HOOPS,This afternoon.
3878,HOOPS,
3879,HOOPS,
3880,HOOPS,Gentleman John:
3881,HOOPS,
3882,HOOPS,You missed a hoop? You mean ...
3883,HOOPS,
3884,HOOPS,
3885,HOOPS,Merry Andrew:
3886,HOOPS,
3887,HOOPS,"That I am done, used up, scrapped, on the shelf,"
3888,HOOPS,"Out of the running--only that, no more."
3889,HOOPS,
3890,HOOPS,
3891,HOOPS,Gentleman John:
3892,HOOPS,
3893,HOOPS,"Well, I've been missing hoops my whole life long;"
3894,HOOPS,"Though, when I come to think of it, perhaps"
3895,HOOPS,There's little consolation to be chewed
3896,HOOPS,From crumbs that I can offer.
3897,HOOPS,
3898,HOOPS,
3899,HOOPS,Merry Andrew:
3900,HOOPS,
3901,HOOPS,I've not missed
3902,HOOPS,A hoop since I was six. I'm forty-two.
3903,HOOPS,This is the first time that my body's failed me:
3904,HOOPS,But 'twill not be the last. And ...
3905,HOOPS,
3906,HOOPS,
3907,HOOPS,Gentleman John:
3908,HOOPS,
3909,HOOPS,Such is life!
3910,HOOPS,"You're going to say. You see I've got it pat,"
3911,HOOPS,"Your jaded wheeze. Lord, what a wit I'ld make"
3912,HOOPS,If I'd a set grin painted on my face.
3913,HOOPS,"And such is life, I'ld say a hundred times,"
3914,HOOPS,And each time set the world aroar afresh
3915,HOOPS,At my original humour. Missed a hoop!
3916,HOOPS,"Why, man alive, you've naught to grumble at."
3917,HOOPS,I've boggled every hoop since I was six.
3918,HOOPS,I'm fifty-five; and I've run round a ring
3919,HOOPS,Would make this potty circus seem a pinhole.
3920,HOOPS,I wasn't born to sawdust. I'd the world
3921,HOOPS,For circus ...
3922,HOOPS,
3923,HOOPS,
3924,HOOPS,Merry Andrew:
3925,HOOPS,
3926,HOOPS,It's no time for crowing now.
3927,HOOPS,"I know a gentleman, and take on trust"
3928,HOOPS,The silver spoon and all. My teeth were cut
3929,HOOPS,Upon a horseshoe: and I wasn't born
3930,HOOPS,"To purple and fine linen--but to sawdust,"
3931,HOOPS,"To sawdust, as you say--brought up on sawdust."
3932,HOOPS,I've had to make my daily bread of sawdust:
3933,HOOPS,"Ay, and my children's,--children's, that's the rub,"
3934,HOOPS,As Shakespeare says ...
3935,HOOPS,
3936,HOOPS,
3937,HOOPS,Gentleman John:
3938,HOOPS,
3939,HOOPS,"Ah, there you go again!"
3940,HOOPS,What a rare wit to set the ring aroar--
3941,HOOPS,As Shakespeare says! Crowing? A gentleman?
3942,HOOPS,"Man, didn't you say you'd never missed a hoop?"
3943,HOOPS,"It's only gentlemen who miss no hoops,"
3944,HOOPS,"Clean livers, easy lords of life who take"
3945,HOOPS,"Each obstacle at a leap, who never fail."
3946,HOOPS,You are the gentleman.
3947,HOOPS,
3948,HOOPS,
3949,HOOPS,Merry Andrew:
3950,HOOPS,
3951,HOOPS,Now don't you try
3952,HOOPS,Being funny at my expense; or you'll soon find
3953,HOOPS,I'm not quite done for yet--not quite snuffed out.
3954,HOOPS,There's still a spark of life. You may have words:
3955,HOOPS,But I've a fist will be a match for them.
3956,HOOPS,Words slaver feebly from a broken jaw.
3957,HOOPS,"I've always lived straight, as a man must do"
3958,HOOPS,"In my profession, if he'ld keep in fettle:"
3959,HOOPS,"But I'm no gentleman, for I fail to see"
3960,HOOPS,There's any sport in baiting a poor man
3961,HOOPS,"Because he's losing grip at forty-two,"
3962,HOOPS,And sees his livelihood slipping from his grasp--
3963,HOOPS,"Ay, and his children's bread."
3964,HOOPS,
3965,HOOPS,
3966,HOOPS,Gentleman John:
3967,HOOPS,
3968,HOOPS,"Why, man alive,"
3969,HOOPS,"Who's baiting you? This winded, broken cur,"
3970,HOOPS,"That limps through life, to bait a bull like you!"
3971,HOOPS,"You don't want pity, man! The beaten bull,"
3972,HOOPS,"Even when the dogs are tearing at his gullet,"
3973,HOOPS,"Turns no eye up for pity. I myself,"
3974,HOOPS,"Crippled and hunched and twisted as I am,"
3975,HOOPS,Would make a brave fend to stand up to you
3976,HOOPS,"Until you swallowed your words, if you should slobber"
3977,HOOPS,"Your pity over me. A bull! Nay, man,"
3978,HOOPS,You're nothing but a bear with a sore head.
3979,HOOPS,A bee has stung you--you who've lived on honey.
3980,HOOPS,"Sawdust, forsooth! You've had the sweet of life:"
3981,HOOPS,You've munched the honeycomb till--
3982,HOOPS,
3983,HOOPS,
3984,HOOPS,Merry Andrew:
3985,HOOPS,
3986,HOOPS,Ay! talk's cheap.
3987,HOOPS,But you've no children. You don't understand.
3988,HOOPS,
3989,HOOPS,
3990,HOOPS,Gentleman John:
3991,HOOPS,
3992,HOOPS,
3993,HOOPS,I have no children: I don't understand!
3994,HOOPS,
3995,HOOPS,
3996,HOOPS,Merry Andrew:
3997,HOOPS,
3998,HOOPS,It's children make the difference.
3999,HOOPS,
4000,HOOPS,
4001,HOOPS,Gentleman John:
4002,HOOPS,
4003,HOOPS,Man alive--
4004,HOOPS,"Alive and kicking, though you're shamming dead--"
4005,HOOPS,"You've hit the truth at last. It's that, just that,"
4006,HOOPS,"Makes all the difference. If you hadn't children,"
4007,HOOPS,"I'ld find it in my heart to pity you,"
4008,HOOPS,Granted you'ld let me. I don't understand!
4009,HOOPS,I've seen you stripped. I've seen your children stripped.
4010,HOOPS,You've never seen me naked; but you can guess
4011,HOOPS,"The misstitched, gnarled, and crooked thing I am."
4012,HOOPS,"Now, do you understand? I may have words."
4013,HOOPS,"But you, man, do you never burn with pride"
4014,HOOPS,"That you've begotten those six limber bodies,"
4015,HOOPS,"Firm flesh, and supple sinew, and lithe limb--"
4016,HOOPS,"Six nimble lads, each like young Absalom,"
4017,HOOPS,"With red blood running lively in his veins,"
4018,HOOPS,"Bone of your bone, your very flesh and blood?"
4019,HOOPS,"It's you don't understand. God, what I'ld give"
4020,HOOPS,"This moment to be you, just as you are,"
4021,HOOPS,"Preposterous pantaloons, and purple cats,"
4022,HOOPS,"And painted leer, and crimson curls, and all--"
4023,HOOPS,"To be you now, with only one missed hoop,"
4024,HOOPS,"If I'd six clean-limbed children of my loins,"
4025,HOOPS,"Born of the ecstasy of life within me,"
4026,HOOPS,To keep it quick and valiant in the ring
4027,HOOPS,"When I ... but I ... Man, man, you've missed a hoop;"
4028,HOOPS,But they'll take every hoop like blooded colts:
4029,HOOPS,"And 'twill be you in them that leaps through life,"
4030,HOOPS,"And in their children, and their children's children."
4031,HOOPS,God! doesn't it make you hold your breath to think
4032,HOOPS,"There'll always be an Andrew in the ring,"
4033,HOOPS,"The very spit and image of you stripped,"
4034,HOOPS,While life's old circus lasts? And I ... at least
4035,HOOPS,There is no twisted thing of my begetting
4036,HOOPS,To keep my shame alive: and that's the most
4037,HOOPS,"That I've to pride myself upon. But, God,"
4038,HOOPS,"I'm proud, ay, proud as Lucifer, of that."
4039,HOOPS,"Think what it means, with all the urge and sting,"
4040,HOOPS,When such a lust of life runs in the veins.
4041,HOOPS,"You, with your six sons, and your one missed hoop,"
4042,HOOPS,"Put that thought in your pipe and smoke it. Well,"
4043,HOOPS,And how d'you like the flavour? Something bitter?
4044,HOOPS,And burns the tongue a trifle? That's the brand
4045,HOOPS,That I must smoke while I've the breath to puff.
4046,HOOPS,(Pause.)
4047,HOOPS,"I've always worshipped the body, all my life--"
4048,HOOPS,"The body, quick with the perfect health which is beauty,"
4049,HOOPS,"Lively, lissom, alert, and taking its way"
4050,HOOPS,Through the world with the easy gait of the early gods.
4051,HOOPS,The only moments I've lived my life to the full
4052,HOOPS,And that live again in remembrance unfaded are those
4053,HOOPS,"When I've seen life compact in some perfect body,"
4054,HOOPS,The living God made manifest in man:
4055,HOOPS,"A diver in the Mediterranean, resting,"
4056,HOOPS,"With sleeked black hair, and glistening salt-tanned skin,"
4057,HOOPS,"Gripping the quivering gunwale with tense hands,"
4058,HOOPS,"His torso lifted out of the peacock sea,"
4059,HOOPS,"Like Neptune, carved in amber, come to life:"
4060,HOOPS,A stark Egyptian on the Nile's edge poised
4061,HOOPS,"Like a bronze Osiris against the lush, rank green:"
4062,HOOPS,"A fisherman dancing reels, on New Year's Eve,"
4063,HOOPS,"In a hall of shadowy rafters and flickering lights,"
4064,HOOPS,"At St Abbs on the Berwickshire coast, to the skirl of the pipes,"
4065,HOOPS,"The lift of the wave in his heels, the sea in his veins:"
4066,HOOPS,"A Cherokee Indian, as though he were one with his horse,"
4067,HOOPS,"His coppery shoulders agleam, his feathers aflame"
4068,HOOPS,"With the last of the sun, descending a gulch in Alaska;"
4069,HOOPS,"A brawny Cleveland puddler, stripped to the loins,"
4070,HOOPS,"On the cauldron's brink, stirring the molten iron"
4071,HOOPS,"In the white-hot glow, a man of white-hot metal:"
4072,HOOPS,A Cornish ploughboy driving an easy share
4073,HOOPS,"Through the grey, light soil of a headland, against a sea"
4074,HOOPS,"Of sapphire, gay in his new white corduroys,"
4075,HOOPS,"Blue-eyed, dark-haired, and whistling a careless tune:"
4076,HOOPS,"Jack Johnson, stripped for the ring, in his swarthy pride"
4077,HOOPS,Of sleek and rippling muscle ...
4078,HOOPS,
4079,HOOPS,
4080,HOOPS,Merry Andrew:
4081,HOOPS,
4082,HOOPS,Jack's the boy!
4083,HOOPS,"Ay, he's the proper figure of a man."
4084,HOOPS,But he'll grow fat and flabby and scant of breath.
4085,HOOPS,He'll miss his hoop some day.
4086,HOOPS,
4087,HOOPS,
4088,HOOPS,Gentleman John:
4089,HOOPS,
4090,HOOPS,But what are words
4091,HOOPS,To shape the joy of form? The Greeks did best
4092,HOOPS,To cut in marble or to cast in bronze
4093,HOOPS,Their ecstasy of living. I remember
4094,HOOPS,"A marvellous Hermes that I saw in Athens,"
4095,HOOPS,Fished from the very bottom of the deep
4096,HOOPS,"Where he had lain two thousand years or more,"
4097,HOOPS,"Wrecked with a galleyful of Roman pirates,"
4098,HOOPS,Among the white bones of his plunderers
4099,HOOPS,Whose flesh had fed the fishes as they sank--
4100,HOOPS,"Serene in cold, imperishable beauty,"
4101,HOOPS,"Biding his time, till he should rise again,"
4102,HOOPS,"Exultant from the wave, for all men's worship,"
4103,HOOPS,"The morning-spring of life, the youth of the world,"
4104,HOOPS,Shaped in sea-coloured bronze for everlasting.
4105,HOOPS,"Ay, the Greeks knew: but men have forgotten now."
4106,HOOPS,Not easily do we meet beauty walking
4107,HOOPS,The world to-day in all the body's pride.
4108,HOOPS,That's why I'm here--a stable-boy to camels--
4109,HOOPS,For in the circus-ring there's more delight
4110,HOOPS,"Of seemly bodies, goodly in sheer health,"
4111,HOOPS,"Bodies trained and tuned to the perfect pitch,"
4112,HOOPS,"Eager, blithe, debonair, from head to heel"
4113,HOOPS,"Aglow and alive in every pulse, than elsewhere"
4114,HOOPS,"In this machine-ridden land of grimy, glum"
4115,HOOPS,"Round-shouldered, coughing mechanics. Once I lived"
4116,HOOPS,"In London, in a slum called Paradise,"
4117,HOOPS,Sickened to see the greasy pavements crawling
4118,HOOPS,"With puny flabby babies, thick as maggots."
4119,HOOPS,Poor brats! I'ld soon go mad if I'd to live
4120,HOOPS,"In London, with its stunted men and women"
4121,HOOPS,But little better to look on than myself.
4122,HOOPS,
4123,HOOPS,"Yet, there's an island where the men keep fit--"
4124,HOOPS,"St Kilda's, a stark fastness of high crag:"
4125,HOOPS,They must keep fit or famish: their main food
4126,HOOPS,The Solan goose; and it's a chancy job
4127,HOOPS,To swing down a sheer face of slippery granite
4128,HOOPS,And drop a noose over the sentinel bird
4129,HOOPS,Ere he can squawk to rouse the sleeping flock.
4130,HOOPS,They must keep fit--their bodies taut and trim--
4131,HOOPS,"To have the nerve: and they're like tempered steel,"
4132,HOOPS,Suppled and fined. But even they've grown slacker
4133,HOOPS,"Through traffic with the mainland, in these days."
4134,HOOPS,"A hundred years ago, the custom held"
4135,HOOPS,"That none should take a wife till he had stood,"
4136,HOOPS,"His left heel on the dizziest point of crag,"
4137,HOOPS,"His right leg and both arms stretched in mid air,"
4138,HOOPS,Above the sea: three hundred feet to drop
4139,HOOPS,"To death, if he should fail--a Spartan test."
4140,HOOPS,"But any man who could have failed, would scarce"
4141,HOOPS,Have earned his livelihood or his children's bread
4142,HOOPS,On that bleak rock.
4143,HOOPS,
4144,HOOPS,
4145,HOOPS,Merry Andrew (drowsily):
4146,HOOPS,
4147,HOOPS,"Ay, children--that's it, children!"
4148,HOOPS,
4149,HOOPS,
4150,HOOPS,Gentleman John:
4151,HOOPS,
4152,HOOPS,"St Kilda's children had a chance, at least,"
4153,HOOPS,With none begotten idly of weakling fathers.
4154,HOOPS,A Spartan test for fatherhood! Should they miss
4155,HOOPS,"Their hoop, 'twas death, and childless. You have still"
4156,HOOPS,"Six lives to take unending hoops for you,"
4157,HOOPS,And you yourself are not done yet ...
4158,HOOPS,
4159,HOOPS,
4160,HOOPS,Merry Andrew (more drowsily):
4161,HOOPS,
4162,HOOPS,Not yet.
4163,HOOPS,And there's much comfort in the thought of children.
4164,HOOPS,"They're bonnie boys enough; and should do well,"
4165,HOOPS,"If I can but keep going a little while,"
4166,HOOPS,A little longer till ...
4167,HOOPS,
4168,HOOPS,
4169,HOOPS,Gentleman John:
4170,HOOPS,
4171,HOOPS,Six strapping sons!
4172,HOOPS,And I have naught but camels.
4173,HOOPS,(Pause.)
4174,HOOPS,"Yet, I've seen"
4175,HOOPS,A vision in this stable that puts to shame
4176,HOOPS,Each ecstasy of mortal flesh and blood
4177,HOOPS,That's been my eyes' delight. I never breathed
4178,HOOPS,A word of it to man or woman yet:
4179,HOOPS,"I couldn't whisper it now to you, if you looked"
4180,HOOPS,Like any human thing this side of death.
4181,HOOPS,'Twas on the night I stumbled on the circus.
4182,HOOPS,"I'd wandered all day, lost among the fells,"
4183,HOOPS,"Over snow-smothered hills, through blinding blizzard,"
4184,HOOPS,"Whipped by a wind that seemed to strip and skin me,"
4185,HOOPS,Till I was one numb ache of sodden ice.
4186,HOOPS,"Quite done, and drunk with cold, I'ld soon have dropped"
4187,HOOPS,Dead in a ditch; when suddenly a lantern
4188,HOOPS,Dazzled my eyes. I smelt a queer warm smell;
4189,HOOPS,And felt a hot puff in my face; and blundered
4190,HOOPS,Out of the flurry of snow and raking wind
4191,HOOPS,Dizzily into a glowing Arabian night
4192,HOOPS,Of elephants and camels having supper.
4193,HOOPS,"I thought that I'd gone mad, stark, staring mad;"
4194,HOOPS,But I was much too sleepy to mind just then--
4195,HOOPS,Dropped dead asleep upon a truss of hay;
4196,HOOPS,"And lay, a log, till--well, I cannot tell"
4197,HOOPS,How long I lay unconscious. I but know
4198,HOOPS,"I slept, and wakened, and that 'twas no dream."
4199,HOOPS,"I heard a rustle in the hay beside me,"
4200,HOOPS,"And opening sleepy eyes, scarce marvelling,"
4201,HOOPS,"I saw her, standing naked in the lamplight,"
4202,HOOPS,"Beneath the huge tent's cavernous canopy,"
4203,HOOPS,Against the throng of elephants and camels
4204,HOOPS,"That champed unwondering in the golden dusk,"
4205,HOOPS,"Moon-white Diana, mettled Artemis--"
4206,HOOPS,"Her body, quick and tense as her own bowstring,"
4207,HOOPS,"Her spirit, an arrow barbed and strung for flight--"
4208,HOOPS,"White snowflakes melting on her night-black hair,"
4209,HOOPS,And on her glistening breasts and supple thighs:
4210,HOOPS,"Her red lips parted, her keen eyes alive"
4211,HOOPS,"With fierce, far-ranging hungers of the chase"
4212,HOOPS,Over the hills of morn--The lantern guttered
4213,HOOPS,And I was left alone in the outer darkness
4214,HOOPS,Among the champing elephants and camels.
4215,HOOPS,And I'll be a camel-keeper to the end:
4216,HOOPS,Though never again my eyes...
4217,HOOPS,(Pause.)
4218,HOOPS,"So you can sleep,"
4219,HOOPS,"You Merry Andrew, for all you missed your hoop."
4220,HOOPS,"It's just as well, perhaps. Now I can hold"
4221,HOOPS,"My secret to the end. Ah, here they come!"
4222,HOOPS,
4223,HOOPS,
4224,HOOPS,"[Six lads, between the ages of three and twelve, clad in pink tights"
4225,HOOPS,"covered with silver spangles, tumble into the tent.]"

4227,HOOPS,
4228,HOOPS,The Eldest Boy:
4229,HOOPS,
4230,HOOPS,"Daddy, the bell's rung, and--"
4231,HOOPS,
4232,HOOPS,
4233,HOOPS,Gentleman John:
4234,HOOPS,
4235,HOOPS,He's snoozing sound.
4236,HOOPS,(to the youngest boy)
4237,HOOPS,"You just creep quietly, and take tight hold"
4238,HOOPS,"Of the crimson curls, and tug, and you will hear"
4239,HOOPS,The purple pussies all caterwaul at once.

4276,THE BULL,Slouching in the undergrowth
4277,THE BULL,"Of the forest beautiful,"
4278,THE BULL,"Banished from the herd he led,"
4279,THE BULL,Bulls and cows a thousand head.
4280,THE BULL,
4281,THE BULL,Cranes and gaudy parrots go
4282,THE BULL,Up and down the burning sky;
4283,THE BULL,Tree-top cats purr drowsily
4284,THE BULL,In the dim-day green below;
4285,THE BULL,"And troops of monkeys, nutting, some,"
4286,THE BULL,"All disputing, go and come;"
4287,THE BULL,
4288,THE BULL,And things abominable sit
4289,THE BULL,"Picking offal buck or swine,"
4290,THE BULL,On the mess and over it
4291,THE BULL,"Burnished flies and beetles shine,"
4292,THE BULL,And spiders big as bladders lie
4293,THE BULL,Under hemlocks ten foot high;

4295,THE BULL,And a dotted serpent curled
4296,THE BULL,"Round and round and round a tree,"
4297,THE BULL,"Yellowing its greenery,"
4298,THE BULL,"Keeps a watch on all the world,"
4299,THE BULL,All the world and this old bull
4300,THE BULL,In the forest beautiful.
4301,THE BULL,
4302,THE BULL,Bravely by his fall he came:
4303,THE BULL,"One he led, a bull of blood"
4304,THE BULL,"Newly come to lustihood,"
4305,THE BULL,"Fought and put his prince to shame,"
4306,THE BULL,Snuffed and pawed the prostrate head
4307,THE BULL,Tameless even while it bled.
4308,THE BULL,
4309,THE BULL,"There they left him, every one,"
4310,THE BULL,"Left him there without a lick,"
4311,THE BULL,"Left him for the birds to pick,"
4312,THE BULL,"Left him there for carrion,"
4313,THE BULL,Vilely from their bosom cast
4314,THE BULL,"Wisdom, worth and love at last."
4315,THE BULL,

4320,THE BULL,Then this prince no more to reign
4321,THE BULL,Came to life and lived again.
4322,THE BULL,
4323,THE BULL,"He snuffed the herd in far retreat,"
4324,THE BULL,"He saw the blood upon the ground,"
4325,THE BULL,And snuffed the burning airs around
4326,THE BULL,"Still with beevish odours sweet,"
4327,THE BULL,While the blood ran down his head
4328,THE BULL,And his mouth ran slaver red.
4329,THE BULL,
4330,THE BULL,"Pity him, this fallen chief,"
4331,THE BULL,"All his splendour, all his strength,"
4332,THE BULL,All his body's breadth and length
4333,THE BULL,"Dwindled down with shame and grief,"
4334,THE BULL,"Half the bull he was before,"
4335,THE BULL,"Bones and leather, nothing more."
4336,THE BULL,
4337,THE BULL,See him standing dewlap-deep
4338,THE BULL,"In the rushes at the lake,"
4339,THE BULL,"Surly, stupid, half asleep,"
4340,THE BULL,Waiting for his heart to break
4341,THE BULL,And the birds to join the flies
4342,THE BULL,"Feasting at his bloodshot eyes,--"
4343,THE BULL,
4344,THE BULL,Standing with his head hung down
4345,THE BULL,"In a stupor, dreaming things:"
4346,THE BULL,"Green savannas, jungles brown,"
4347,THE BULL,"Battlefields and bellowings,"
4348,THE BULL,Bulls undone and lions dead
4349,THE BULL,And vultures flapping overhead.
4350,THE BULL,
4351,THE BULL,Dreaming things: of days he spent
4352,THE BULL,With his mother gaunt and lean
4353,THE BULL,"In the valley warm and green,"
4354,THE BULL,"Full of baby wonderment,"
4355,THE BULL,Blinking out of silly eyes
4356,THE BULL,At a hundred mysteries;
4357,THE BULL,
4358,THE BULL,Dreaming over once again
4359,THE BULL,How he wandered with a throng
4360,THE BULL,"Of bulls and cows a thousand strong,"
4361,THE BULL,"Wandered on from plain to plain,"
4362,THE BULL,"Up the hill and down the dale,"
4363,THE BULL,Always at his mother's tail;
4364,THE BULL,
4365,THE BULL,"How he lagged behind the herd,"
4366,THE BULL,"Lagged and tottered, weak of limb,"
4367,THE BULL,And she turned and ran to him
4368,THE BULL,Blaring at the loathly bird
4369,THE BULL,"Stationed always in the skies,"
4370,THE BULL,Waiting for the flesh that dies.
4371,THE BULL,
4372,THE BULL,Dreaming maybe of a day
4373,THE BULL,When her drained and drying paps
4374,THE BULL,"Turned him to the sweets and saps,"
4375,THE BULL,"Richer fountains by the way,"
4376,THE BULL,And she left the bull she bore
4377,THE BULL,And he looked to her no more;
4378,THE BULL,
4379,THE BULL,"And his little frame grew stout,"
4380,THE BULL,"And his little legs grew strong,"
4381,THE BULL,And the way was not so long;
4382,THE BULL,"And his little horns came out,"
4383,THE BULL,And he played at butting trees
4384,THE BULL,"And boulder-stones and tortoises,"
4385,THE BULL,
4386,THE BULL,Joined a game of knobby skulls
4387,THE BULL,"With the youngsters of his year,"
4388,THE BULL,"All the other little bulls,"
4389,THE BULL,"Learning both to bruise and bear,"
4390,THE BULL,Learning how to stand a shock
4391,THE BULL,Like a little bull of rock.
4392,THE BULL,
4393,THE BULL,"Dreaming of a day less dim,"
4394,THE BULL,"Dreaming of a time less far,"
4395,THE BULL,When the faint but certain star
4396,THE BULL,"Of destiny burned clear for him,"
4397,THE BULL,And a fierce and wild unrest
4398,THE BULL,"Broke the quiet of his breast,"
4399,THE BULL,
4400,THE BULL,And the gristles of his youth
4401,THE BULL,"Hardened in his comely pow,"
4402,THE BULL,"And he came to fighting growth,"
4403,THE BULL,"Beat his bull and won his cow,"
4404,THE BULL,And flew his tail and trampled off
4405,THE BULL,"Past the tallest, vain enough,"
4406,THE BULL,
4407,THE BULL,And curved about in splendour full
4408,THE BULL,And curved again and snuffed the airs
4409,THE BULL,As who should say Come out who dares!
4410,THE BULL,"And all beheld a bull, a Bull,"
4411,THE BULL,And knew that here was surely one
4412,THE BULL,"That backed for no bull, fearing none."
4413,THE BULL,
4414,THE BULL,And the leader of the herd
4415,THE BULL,"Looked and saw, and beat the ground,"
4416,THE BULL,"And shook the forest with his sound,"
4417,THE BULL,Bellowed at the loathly bird
4418,THE BULL,"Stationed always in the skies,"
4419,THE BULL,Waiting for the flesh that dies.
4420,THE BULL,
4421,THE BULL,"Dreaming, this old bull forlorn,"
4422,THE BULL,Surely dreaming of the hour
4423,THE BULL,"When he came to sultan power,"
4424,THE BULL,"And they owned him master-horn,"
4425,THE BULL,Chiefest bull of all among
4426,THE BULL,Bulls and cows a thousand strong.
4427,THE BULL,
4428,THE BULL,And in all the tramping herd
4429,THE BULL,"Not a bull that barred his way,"
4430,THE BULL,"Not a cow that said him nay,"
4431,THE BULL,Not a bull or cow that erred
4432,THE BULL,In the furnace of his look
4433,THE BULL,"Dared a second, worse rebuke;"
4434,THE BULL,
4435,THE BULL,"Not in all the forest wide,"
4436,THE BULL,"Jungle, thicket, pasture, fen,"
4437,THE BULL,"Not another dared him then,"
4438,THE BULL,Dared him and again defied;
4439,THE BULL,Not a sovereign buck or boar
4440,THE BULL,Came a second time for more.
4441,THE BULL,
4442,THE BULL,Not a serpent that survived
4443,THE BULL,Once the terrors of his hoof
4444,THE BULL,"Risked a second time reproof,"
4445,THE BULL,"Came a second time and lived,"
4446,THE BULL,Not a serpent in its skin
4447,THE BULL,Came again for discipline;
4448,THE BULL,
4449,THE BULL,"Not a leopard bright as flame,"
4450,THE BULL,"Flashing fingerhooks of steel,"
4451,THE BULL,"That a wooden tree might feel,"
4452,THE BULL,Met his fury once and came
4453,THE BULL,"For a second reprimand,"
4454,THE BULL,Not a leopard in the land.
4455,THE BULL,
4456,THE BULL,"Not a lion of them all,"
4457,THE BULL,"Not a lion of the hills,"
4458,THE BULL,"Hero of a thousand kills,"
4459,THE BULL,"Dared a second fight and fall,"
4460,THE BULL,"Dared that ram terrific twice,"
4461,THE BULL,Paid a second time the price ...
4462,THE BULL,
4463,THE BULL,"Pity him, this dupe of dream,"
4464,THE BULL,Leader of the herd again
4465,THE BULL,"Only in his daft old brain,"
4466,THE BULL,Once again the bull supreme
4467,THE BULL,And bull enough to bear the part
4468,THE BULL,Only in his tameless heart.
4469,THE BULL,
4470,THE BULL,Pity him that he must wake;
4471,THE BULL,Even now the swarm of flies
4472,THE BULL,Blackening his bloodshot eyes
4473,THE BULL,"Bursts and blusters round the lake,"
4474,THE BULL,"Scattered from the feast half-fed,"
4475,THE BULL,By great shadows overhead.
4476,THE BULL,
4477,THE BULL,And the dreamer turns away
4478,THE BULL,From his visionary herds
4479,THE BULL,"And his splendid yesterday,"
4480,THE BULL,Turns to meet the loathly birds
4481,THE BULL,"Flocking round him from the skies,"
4482,THE BULL,Waiting for the flesh that dies.

4510,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Though none so hard as I.
4511,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4512,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"It seemed, so still the valleys were,"
4513,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"As if the whole world knelt at prayer,"
4514,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Save me and me alone;
4515,THE SONG OF HONOUR,So pure and wide that silence was
4516,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"I feared to bend a blade of grass,"
4517,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And there I stood like stone.
4518,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4519,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"There, sharp and sudden, there I heard--"
4520,THE SONG OF HONOUR,'Ah! some wild lovesick singing bird
4521,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Woke singing in the trees?'
4522,THE SONG OF HONOUR,'The nightingale and babble-wren
4523,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Were in the English greenwood then,"
4524,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And you heard one of these?'
4525,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4526,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The babble-wren and nightingale
4527,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Sang in the Abyssinian vale
4528,THE SONG OF HONOUR,That season of the year!
4529,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Yet, true enough, I heard them plain,"
4530,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"I heard them both again, again,"
4531,THE SONG OF HONOUR,As sharp and sweet and clear
4532,THE SONG OF HONOUR,As if the Abyssinian tree
4533,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Had thrust a bough across the sea,"
4534,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Had thrust a bough across to me
4535,THE SONG OF HONOUR,With music for my ear!
4536,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4537,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"I heard them both, and oh! I heard"
4538,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of every singing bird
4539,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"That sings beneath the sky,"
4540,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And with the song of lark and wren
4541,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The song of mountains, moths and men"
4542,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And seas and rainbows vie!
4543,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4544,THE SONG OF HONOUR,I heard the universal choir
4545,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The Sons of Light exalt their Sire
4546,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"With universal song,"
4547,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Earth's lowliest and loudest notes,"
4548,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Her million times ten million throats
4549,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Exalt Him loud and long,"
4550,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And lips and lungs and tongues of Grace
4551,THE SONG OF HONOUR,From every part and every place
4552,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Within the shining of His face,"
4553,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The universal throng.
4554,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4555,THE SONG OF HONOUR,I heard the hymn of being sound
4556,THE SONG OF HONOUR,From every well of honour found
4557,THE SONG OF HONOUR,In human sense and soul:
4558,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of poets when they write
4559,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The testament of Beautysprite
4560,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Upon a flying scroll,"
4561,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of painters when they take
4562,THE SONG OF HONOUR,A burning brush for Beauty's sake
4563,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And limn her features whole--
4564,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4565,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of men divinely wise
4566,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Who look and see in starry skies
4567,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Not stars so much as robins' eyes,"
4568,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And when these pale away
4569,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Hear flocks of shiny pleiades
4570,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Among the plums and apple trees
4571,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Sing in the summer day--
4572,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of all both high and low
4573,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"To some blest vision true,"
4574,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of beggars when they throw
4575,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The crust of pity all men owe
4576,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"To hungry sparrows in the snow,"
4577,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Old beggars hungry too--
4578,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of kings of kingdoms when
4579,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"They rise above their fortune men,"
4580,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And crown themselves anew,--"
4581,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4582,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The song of courage, heart and will"
4583,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And gladness in a fight,"
4584,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Of men who face a hopeless hill
4585,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"With sparking and delight,"
4586,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The bells and bells of song that ring
4587,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Round banners of a cause or king
4588,THE SONG OF HONOUR,From armies bleeding white--
4589,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4590,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of sailors every one
4591,THE SONG OF HONOUR,When monstrous tide and tempest run
4592,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"At ships like bulls at red,"
4593,THE SONG OF HONOUR,When stately ships are twirled and spun
4594,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Like whipping tops and help there's none
4595,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And mighty ships ten thousand ton
4596,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Go down like lumps of lead--
4597,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4598,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And song of fighters stern as they
4599,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"At odds with fortune night and day,"
4600,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Crammed up in cities grim and grey
4601,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"As thick as bees in hives,"
4602,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Hosannas of a lowly throng
4603,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Who sing unconscious of their song,"
4604,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Whose lips are in their lives--
4605,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4606,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And song of some at holy war
4607,THE SONG OF HONOUR,With spells and ghouls more dread by far
4608,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Than deadly seas and cities are,"
4609,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Or hordes of quarrelling kings---
4610,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The song of fighters great and small,"
4611,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The song of pretty fighters all,"
4612,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And high heroic things--
4613,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4614,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of lovers--who knows how
4615,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Twitched up from place and time
4616,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Upon a sigh, a blush, a vow,"
4617,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"A curve or hue of cheek or brow,"
4618,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Borne up and off from here and now
4619,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Into the void sublime!
4620,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4621,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And crying loves and passions still
4622,THE SONG OF HONOUR,In every key from soft to shrill
4623,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And numbers never done,"
4624,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Dog-loyalties to faith and friend,"
4625,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And loves like Ruth's of old no end,"
4626,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And intermission none--
4627,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And burst on burst for beauty and
4628,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"For numbers not behind,"
4629,THE SONG OF HONOUR,From men whose love of motherland
4630,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Is like a dog's for one dear hand,"
4631,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Sole, selfless, boundless, blind--"
4632,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And song of some with hearts beside
4633,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"For men and sorrows far and wide,"
4634,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Who watch the world with pity and pride
4635,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And warm to all mankind--
4636,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4637,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And endless joyous music rise
4638,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"From children at their play,"
4639,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And endless soaring lullabies
4640,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"From happy, happy mothers' eyes,"
4641,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And answering crows and baby cries,"
4642,THE SONG OF HONOUR,How many who shall say!
4643,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And many a song as wondrous well
4644,THE SONG OF HONOUR,With pangs and sweets intolerable
4645,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"From lonely hearths too gray to tell,"
4646,THE SONG OF HONOUR,God knows how utter gray!
4647,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And song from many a house of care
4648,THE SONG OF HONOUR,When pain has forced a footing there
4649,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And there's a Darkness on the stair
4650,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Will not be turned away--
4651,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4652,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And song--that song whose singers come
4653,THE SONG OF HONOUR,With old kind tales of pity from
4654,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The Great Compassion's lips,"
4655,THE SONG OF HONOUR,That makes the bells of Heaven to peal
4656,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Round pillows frosty with the feel
4657,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Of Death's cold finger tips--
4658,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4659,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The song of men all sorts and kinds,"
4660,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"As many tempers, moods and minds"
4661,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"As leaves are on a tree,"
4662,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"As many faiths and castes and creeds,"
4663,THE SONG OF HONOUR,As many human bloods and breeds
4664,THE SONG OF HONOUR,As in the world may be;
4665,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4666,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of each and all who gaze
4667,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"On Beauty in her naked blaze,"
4668,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Or see her dimly in a haze,"
4669,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Or get her light in fitful rays
4670,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And tiniest needles even,"
4671,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The song of all not wholly dark,"
4672,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Not wholly sunk in stupor stark
4673,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Too deep for groping Heaven--
4674,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4675,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And alleluias sweet and clear
4676,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And wild with beauty men mishear,"
4677,THE SONG OF HONOUR,From choirs of song as near and dear
4678,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"To Paradise as they,"
4679,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The everlasting pipe and flute
4680,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Of wind and sea and bird and brute,"
4681,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And lips deaf men imagine mute
4682,THE SONG OF HONOUR,In wood and stone and clay;
4683,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4684,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The music of a lion strong
4685,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"That shakes a hill a whole night long,"
4686,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"A hill as loud as he,"
4687,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The twitter of a mouse among
4688,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Melodious greenery,"
4689,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The ruby's and the rainbow's song,"
4690,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The nightingale's--all three,"
4691,THE SONG OF HONOUR,The song of life that wells and flows
4692,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"From every leopard, lark and rose"
4693,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And everything that gleams or goes
4694,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Lack-lustre in the sea.
4695,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4696,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"I heard it all, each, every note"
4697,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Of every lung and tongue and throat,"
4698,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Ay, every rhythm and rhyme"
4699,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Of everything that lives and loves
4700,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And upward, ever upward moves"
4701,THE SONG OF HONOUR,From lowly to sublime!
4702,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Earth's multitudinous Sons of Light,"
4703,THE SONG OF HONOUR,I heard them lift their lyric might
4704,THE SONG OF HONOUR,With each and every chanting sprite
4705,THE SONG OF HONOUR,That lit the sky that wondrous night
4706,THE SONG OF HONOUR,As far as eye could climb!
4707,THE SONG OF HONOUR,
4708,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"I heard it all, I heard the whole"
4709,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Harmonious hymn of being roll
4710,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Up through the chapel of my soul
4711,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"And at the altar die,"
4712,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And in the awful quiet then
4713,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Myself I heard, Amen, Amen,"
4714,THE SONG OF HONOUR,Amen I heard me cry!
4715,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"I heard it all, and then although"
4716,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"I caught my flying senses, oh,"
4717,THE SONG OF HONOUR,A dizzy man was I!
4718,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"I stood and stared; the sky was lit,"
4719,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"The sky was stars all over it,"
4720,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"I stood, I knew not why,"
4721,THE SONG OF HONOUR,"Without a wish, without a will,"
4722,THE SONG OF HONOUR,I stood upon that silent hill
4723,THE SONG OF HONOUR,And stared into the sky until
4724,THE SONG OF HONOUR,My eyes were blind with stars and still
4725,THE SONG OF HONOUR,I stared into the sky.

4769,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,The little pansies by the road have turned
4770,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,"Away their purple faces and their gold,"
4771,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,"And evening has taken all the bees from the thyme,"
4772,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,And all the scent is shed away by the cold.
4773,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,
4774,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,Against the hard and pale blue evening sky
4775,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,The mountain's new-dropped summer snow is clear
4776,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,Glistening in steadfast stillness: like transcendent
4777,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,Clean pain sending on us a chill down here.
4778,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,
4779,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,Christ on the Cross!--his beautiful young man's body
4780,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,"Has fallen dead upon the nails, and hangs"
4781,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,"White and loose at last, with all the pain"
4782,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,"Drawn on his mouth, eyes broken at last by his pangs."
4783,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,
4784,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,"And slowly down the mountain road, belated,"

4786,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,"To gaze any more at the Christ, whom the mountain snows"
4787,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,"Whitely confront; I wait on the grass, am lamed."

4793,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,
4794,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,Surely about his sunburnt face is something
4795,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,That vexes me with wonder. He sits so still
4796,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,"Here among all this silence, crouching forward,"
4797,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,Dreaming and letting the bullock take its will.
4798,MEETING AMONG THE MOUNTAINS,

4834,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"What large, dark hands are those at the window"
4835,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Lifted, grasping in the yellow light"
4836,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Which makes its way through the curtain web
4837,CRUELTY AND LOVE,At my heart to-night?
4838,CRUELTY AND LOVE,
4839,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Ah, only the leaves! So leave me at rest,"
4840,CRUELTY AND LOVE,In the west I see a redness come
4841,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Over the evening's burning breast--
4842,CRUELTY AND LOVE,For now the pain is numb.
4843,CRUELTY AND LOVE,
4844,CRUELTY AND LOVE,The woodbine creeps abroad
4845,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Calling low to her lover:
4846,CRUELTY AND LOVE,The sunlit flirt who all the day
4847,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Has poised above her lips in play
4848,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"And stolen kisses, shallow and gay"
4849,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Of dalliance, now has gone away"
4850,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"--She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,"
4851,CRUELTY AND LOVE,And when above her his broad wings hover
4852,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Then her bright breast she will uncover
4853,CRUELTY AND LOVE,And yield her honey-drop to her lover.
4854,CRUELTY AND LOVE,
4855,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Into the yellow, evening glow"
4856,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Saunters a man from the farm below,"
4857,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed"
4858,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.
4859,CRUELTY AND LOVE,The bird lies warm against the wall.
4860,CRUELTY AND LOVE,She glances quick her startled eyes
4861,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Towards him, then she turns away"
4862,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Her small head, making warm display"
4863,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Of red upon the throat. Her terrors sway
4864,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,"
4865,CRUELTY AND LOVE,
4866,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Whose plaintive cries start up as she flies
4867,CRUELTY AND LOVE,In one blue stoop from out the sties
4868,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Into the evening's empty hall.
4869,CRUELTY AND LOVE,
4870,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes"
4871,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,"
4872,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,"
4873,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Till the distance covers his dangerous tread.
4874,CRUELTY AND LOVE,
4875,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"The rabbit presses back her ears,"
4876,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes"
4877,CRUELTY AND LOVE,And crouches low: then with wild spring
4878,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Spurts from the terror of the oncoming
4879,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"To be choked back, the wire ring"
4880,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Her frantic effort throttling:
4881,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!
4882,CRUELTY AND LOVE,
4883,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,"
4884,CRUELTY AND LOVE,And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.
4885,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Yet calm and kindly are his eyes
4886,CRUELTY AND LOVE,And ready to open in brown surprise
4887,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Should I not answer to his talk
4888,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Or should he my tears surmise.
4889,CRUELTY AND LOVE,
4890,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair"
4891,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Watching the door open: he flashes bare
4892,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes"
4893,CRUELTY AND LOVE,In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise

4898,CRUELTY AND LOVE,His coming: he raises up my face to him
4899,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"And caresses my mouth with his fingers, smelling grim"
4900,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare"
4901,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"I know not what fine wire is round my throat,"
4902,CRUELTY AND LOVE,I only know I let him finger there
4903,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat"
4904,CRUELTY AND LOVE,Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:
4905,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down"
4906,CRUELTY AND LOVE,His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood
4907,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood"
4908,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown"
4909,CRUELTY AND LOVE,"Within him, die, and find death good."

4930,THE WIFE OF LLEW,"And so they broke broad boughs yet moist with dew,"
4931,THE WIFE OF LLEW,And in a shadow made a magic ring:
4932,THE WIFE OF LLEW,They took the violet and the meadow-sweet
4933,THE WIFE OF LLEW,"To form her pretty face, and for her feet"
4934,THE WIFE OF LLEW,"They built a mound of daisies on a wing,"
4935,THE WIFE OF LLEW,And for her voice they made a linnet sing
4936,THE WIFE OF LLEW,In the wide poppy blowing for her mouth.
4937,THE WIFE OF LLEW,And over all they chanted twenty hours.

5000,THE 'WANDERER',THE 'WANDERER'
5001,THE 'WANDERER',
5002,THE 'WANDERER',
5003,THE 'WANDERER',"All day they loitered by the resting ships,"
5004,THE 'WANDERER',"Telling their beauties over, taking stock;"
5005,THE 'WANDERER',"At night the verdict left my messmates' lips,"
5006,THE 'WANDERER','The 'Wanderer' is the finest ship in dock.'
5007,THE 'WANDERER',
5008,THE 'WANDERER',"I had not seen her, but a friend, since drowned,"
5009,THE 'WANDERER',"Drew her, with painted ports, low, lovely, lean,"
5010,THE 'WANDERER',"Saying, ''The Wanderer', clipper, outward bound,"
5011,THE 'WANDERER',The loveliest ship my eyes have ever seen--
5012,THE 'WANDERER',
5013,THE 'WANDERER','Perhaps to-morrow you will see her sail.
5014,THE 'WANDERER',She sails at sunrise': but the morrow showed
5015,THE 'WANDERER',No 'Wanderer' setting forth for me to hail;
5016,THE 'WANDERER',"Far down the stream men pointed where she rode,"
5017,THE 'WANDERER',
5018,THE 'WANDERER',"Rode the great trackway to the sea, dim, dim,"
5019,THE 'WANDERER',Already gone before the stars were gone.
5020,THE 'WANDERER',I saw her at the sea-line's smoky rim
5021,THE 'WANDERER',Grow swiftly vaguer as they towed her on.
5022,THE 'WANDERER',
5023,THE 'WANDERER',Soon even her masts were hidden in the haze
5024,THE 'WANDERER',Beyond the city; she was on her course
5025,THE 'WANDERER',To trample billows for a hundred days;
5026,THE 'WANDERER',"That afternoon the norther gathered force,"
5027,THE 'WANDERER',
5028,THE 'WANDERER',Blowing a small snow from a point of east.
5029,THE 'WANDERER',"'Oh, fair for her,' we said, 'to take her south.'"
5030,THE 'WANDERER',"And in our spirits, as the wind increased,"
5031,THE 'WANDERER',"We saw her there, beyond the river mouth,"
5032,THE 'WANDERER',
5033,THE 'WANDERER',"Setting her side-lights in the wildering dark,"
5034,THE 'WANDERER',"To glint upon mad water, while the gale"
5035,THE 'WANDERER',"Roared like a battle, snapping like a shark,"
5036,THE 'WANDERER',And drunken seamen struggled with the sail;
5037,THE 'WANDERER',
5038,THE 'WANDERER',While with sick hearts her mates put out of mind
5039,THE 'WANDERER',"Their little children left astern, ashore,"
5040,THE 'WANDERER',"And the gale's gathering made the darkness blind,"
5041,THE 'WANDERER',Water and air one intermingled roar.
5042,THE 'WANDERER',
5043,THE 'WANDERER',"Then we forgot her, for the fiddlers played,"
5044,THE 'WANDERER',Dancing and singing held our merry crew;
5045,THE 'WANDERER',The old ship moaned a little as she swayed.
5046,THE 'WANDERER',"It blew all night, oh, bitter hard it blew!"
5047,THE 'WANDERER',
5048,THE 'WANDERER',So that at midnight I was called on deck
5049,THE 'WANDERER',To keep an anchor-watch: I heard the sea
5050,THE 'WANDERER',Roar past in white procession filled with wreck;
5051,THE 'WANDERER',"Intense bright frosty stars burned over me,"
5052,THE 'WANDERER',
5053,THE 'WANDERER',And the Greek brig beside us dipped and dipped
5054,THE 'WANDERER',"White to the muzzle like a half-tide rock,"
5055,THE 'WANDERER',Drowned to the mainmast with the seas she shipped;
5056,THE 'WANDERER',Her cable-swivels clanged at every shock.
5057,THE 'WANDERER',
5058,THE 'WANDERER',"And like a never-dying force, the wind"
5059,THE 'WANDERER',"Roared till we shouted with it, roared until"
5060,THE 'WANDERER',"Its vast vitality of wrath was thinned,"
5061,THE 'WANDERER',Had beat its fury breathless and was still.
5062,THE 'WANDERER',
5063,THE 'WANDERER',"By dawn the gale had dwindled into flaw,"
5064,THE 'WANDERER',A glorious morning followed: with my friend
5065,THE 'WANDERER',I climbed the fo'c's'le-head to see; we saw
5066,THE 'WANDERER',The waters hurrying shorewards without end.
5067,THE 'WANDERER',
5068,THE 'WANDERER',Haze blotted out the river's lowest reach;
5069,THE 'WANDERER',"Out of the gloom the steamers, passing by,"
5070,THE 'WANDERER',"Called with their sirens, hooting their sea-speech;"
5071,THE 'WANDERER',Out of the dimness others made reply.
5072,THE 'WANDERER',
5073,THE 'WANDERER',And as we watched there came a rush of feet
5074,THE 'WANDERER',Charging the fo'c's'le till the hatchway shook.
5075,THE 'WANDERER',"Men all about us thrust their way, or beat,"
5076,THE 'WANDERER',"Crying, 'The 'Wanderer'! Down the river! Look!'"
5077,THE 'WANDERER',
5078,THE 'WANDERER',I looked with them towards the dimness; there
5079,THE 'WANDERER',Gleamed like a spirit striding out of night
5080,THE 'WANDERER',"A full-rigged ship unutterably fair,"
5081,THE 'WANDERER',"Her masts like trees in winter, frosty-bright."
5082,THE 'WANDERER',
5083,THE 'WANDERER',Foam trembled at her bows like wisps of wool;
5084,THE 'WANDERER',She trembled as she towed. I had not dreamed
5085,THE 'WANDERER',"That work of man could be so beautiful,"
5086,THE 'WANDERER',In its own presence and in what it seemed.
5087,THE 'WANDERER',
5088,THE 'WANDERER',"'So she is putting back again,' I said."
5089,THE 'WANDERER','How white with frost her yards are on the fore!'
5090,THE 'WANDERER',"One of the men about me answer made,"
5091,THE 'WANDERER',"'That is not frost, but all her sails are tore,"
5092,THE 'WANDERER',
5093,THE 'WANDERER',"'Torn into tatters, youngster, in the gale;"
5094,THE 'WANDERER',"Her best foul-weather suit gone.' It was true,"
5095,THE 'WANDERER',Her masts were white with rags of tattered sail
5096,THE 'WANDERER',Many as gannets when the fish are due.
5097,THE 'WANDERER',
5098,THE 'WANDERER',"Beauty in desolation was her pride,"
5099,THE 'WANDERER',Her crowned array a glory that had been;
5100,THE 'WANDERER',"She faltered tow'rds us like a swan that died,"
5101,THE 'WANDERER',But although ruined she was still a queen.
5102,THE 'WANDERER',
5103,THE 'WANDERER',"'Put back with all her sails gone,' went the word;"
5104,THE 'WANDERER',"Then, from her signals flying, rumour ran,"
5105,THE 'WANDERER','The sea that stove her boats in killed her third;
5106,THE 'WANDERER',She has been gutted and has lost a man.'
5107,THE 'WANDERER',
5108,THE 'WANDERER',"So, as though stepping to a funeral march,"
5109,THE 'WANDERER',She passed defeated homewards whence she came
5110,THE 'WANDERER',"Ragged with tattered canvas white as starch,"
5111,THE 'WANDERER',A wild bird that misfortune had made tame.
5112,THE 'WANDERER',
5113,THE 'WANDERER',She was refitted soon: another took
5114,THE 'WANDERER',The dead man's office; then the singers hove
5115,THE 'WANDERER',Her capstan till the snapping hawsers shook;
5116,THE 'WANDERER',"Out, with a bubble at her bows, she drove."
5117,THE 'WANDERER',
5118,THE 'WANDERER',"Again they towed her seawards, and again"
5119,THE 'WANDERER',"We, watching, praised her beauty, praised her trim,"
5120,THE 'WANDERER',"Saw her fair house-flag flutter at the main,"
5121,THE 'WANDERER',"And slowly saunter seawards, dwindling dim;"
5122,THE 'WANDERER',
5123,THE 'WANDERER',"And wished her well, and wondered, as she died,"
5124,THE 'WANDERER',"How, when her canvas had been sheeted home,"
5125,THE 'WANDERER',"Her quivering length would sweep into her stride,"
5126,THE 'WANDERER',Making the greenness milky with her foam.
5127,THE 'WANDERER',
5128,THE 'WANDERER',"But when we rose next morning, we discerned"
5129,THE 'WANDERER',Her beauty once again a shattered thing;
5130,THE 'WANDERER',"Towing to dock the 'Wanderer' returned,"
5131,THE 'WANDERER',A wounded sea-bird with a broken wing.
5132,THE 'WANDERER',
5133,THE 'WANDERER',"A spar was gone, her rigging's disarray"
5134,THE 'WANDERER',Told of a worse disaster than the last;
5135,THE 'WANDERER',"Like draggled hair dishevelled hung the stay,"
5136,THE 'WANDERER',Drooping and beating on the broken mast.
5137,THE 'WANDERER',
5138,THE 'WANDERER',Half-mast upon her flagstaff hung her flag;
5139,THE 'WANDERER',Word went among us how the broken spar
5140,THE 'WANDERER',"Had gored her captain like an angry stag,"
5141,THE 'WANDERER',And killed her mate a half-day from the bar.
5142,THE 'WANDERER',
5143,THE 'WANDERER',She passed to dock upon the top of flood.
5144,THE 'WANDERER',An old man near me shook his head and swore:
5145,THE 'WANDERER',"'Like a bad woman, she has tasted blood--"
5146,THE 'WANDERER',There'll be no trusting in her any more.'
5147,THE 'WANDERER',
5148,THE 'WANDERER',"We thought it truth, and when we saw her there"
5149,THE 'WANDERER',"Lying in dock, beyond, across the stream,"
5150,THE 'WANDERER',"We would forget that we had called her fair,"
5151,THE 'WANDERER',We thought her murderess and the past a dream.
5152,THE 'WANDERER',
5153,THE 'WANDERER',"And when she sailed again we watched in awe,"
5154,THE 'WANDERER',"Wondering what bloody act her beauty planned,"
5155,THE 'WANDERER',"What evil lurked behind the thing we saw,"
5156,THE 'WANDERER',"What strength was there that thus annulled man's hand,"
5157,THE 'WANDERER',
5158,THE 'WANDERER',How next its triumph would compel man's will
5159,THE 'WANDERER',"Into compliance with external Fate,"
5160,THE 'WANDERER',How next the powers would use her to work ill
5161,THE 'WANDERER',On suffering men; we had not long to wait.
5162,THE 'WANDERER',
5163,THE 'WANDERER',"For soon the outcry of derision rose,"
5164,THE 'WANDERER','Here comes the 'Wanderer'!' the expected cry.
5165,THE 'WANDERER',"Guessing the cause, our mockings joined with those"
5166,THE 'WANDERER',Yelled from the shipping as they towed her by.
5167,THE 'WANDERER',
5168,THE 'WANDERER',"She passed us close, her seamen paid no heed"
5169,THE 'WANDERER',"To what was called: they stood, a sullen group,"
5170,THE 'WANDERER',"Smoking and spitting, careless of her need,"
5171,THE 'WANDERER',Mocking the orders given from the poop.
5172,THE 'WANDERER',
5173,THE 'WANDERER',Her mates and boys were working her; we stared.
5174,THE 'WANDERER',"What was the reason of this strange return,"
5175,THE 'WANDERER',This third annulling of the thing prepared?
5176,THE 'WANDERER',No outward evil could our eyes discern.
5177,THE 'WANDERER',
5178,THE 'WANDERER',Only like someone who has formed a plan
5179,THE 'WANDERER',"Beyond the pitch of common minds, she sailed,"
5180,THE 'WANDERER',"Mocked and deserted by the common man,"
5181,THE 'WANDERER',Made half divine to me for having failed.
5182,THE 'WANDERER',
5183,THE 'WANDERER',We learned the reason soon; below the town
5184,THE 'WANDERER',"A stay had parted like a snapping reed,"
5185,THE 'WANDERER',"'Warning,' the men thought, 'not to take her down.'"
5186,THE 'WANDERER',"They took the omen, they would not proceed."
5187,THE 'WANDERER',
5188,THE 'WANDERER',Days passed before another crew would sign.
5189,THE 'WANDERER',"The 'Wanderer' lay in dock alone, unmanned,"
5190,THE 'WANDERER',"Feared as a thing possessed by powers malign,"
5191,THE 'WANDERER',Bound under curses not to leave the land.
5192,THE 'WANDERER',
5193,THE 'WANDERER',But under passing Time fear passes too;
5194,THE 'WANDERER',"That terror passed, the sailors' hearts grew bold."
5195,THE 'WANDERER',We learned in time that she had found a crew
5196,THE 'WANDERER',And was bound out and southwards as of old.
5197,THE 'WANDERER',
5198,THE 'WANDERER',"And in contempt we thought, 'A little while"
5199,THE 'WANDERER',"Will bring her back again, dismantled, spoiled."
5200,THE 'WANDERER',It is herself; she cannot change her style;
5201,THE 'WANDERER',She has the habit now of being foiled.'
5202,THE 'WANDERER',
5203,THE 'WANDERER',So when a ship appeared among the haze
5204,THE 'WANDERER',"We thought, 'The 'Wanderer' back again'; but no,"
5205,THE 'WANDERER',"No 'Wanderer' showed for many, many days,"
5206,THE 'WANDERER',Her passing lights made other waters glow.
5207,THE 'WANDERER',
5208,THE 'WANDERER',"But we would often think and talk of her,"
5209,THE 'WANDERER',"Tell newer hands her story, wondering, then,"
5210,THE 'WANDERER',"Upon what ocean she was 'Wanderer',"
5211,THE 'WANDERER',Bound to the cities built by foreign men.
5212,THE 'WANDERER',
5213,THE 'WANDERER',"And one by one our little conclave thinned,"
5214,THE 'WANDERER',"Passed into ships, and sailed, and so away,"
5215,THE 'WANDERER',"To drown in some great roaring of the wind,"
5216,THE 'WANDERER',"Wanderers themselves, unhappy fortune's prey."
5217,THE 'WANDERER',
5218,THE 'WANDERER',And Time went by me making memory dim.
5219,THE 'WANDERER',Yet still I wondered if the 'Wanderer' fared
5220,THE 'WANDERER',"Still pointing to the unreached ocean's rim,"
5221,THE 'WANDERER',Brightening the water where her breast was bared.
5222,THE 'WANDERER',
5223,THE 'WANDERER',"And much in ports abroad I eyed the ships,"
5224,THE 'WANDERER',Hoping to see her well-remembered form
5225,THE 'WANDERER',Come with a curl of bubbles at her lips
5226,THE 'WANDERER',"Bright to her berth, the sovereign of the storm."
5227,THE 'WANDERER',
5228,THE 'WANDERER',"I never did, and many years went by;"
5229,THE 'WANDERER',"Then, near a Southern port, one Christmas Eve,"
5230,THE 'WANDERER',"I watched a gale go roaring through the sky,"
5231,THE 'WANDERER',Making the cauldrons of the clouds upheave.
5232,THE 'WANDERER',
5233,THE 'WANDERER',"Then the wrack tattered and the stars appeared,"
5234,THE 'WANDERER',Millions of stars that seemed to speak in fire;
5235,THE 'WANDERER',"A byre-cock cried aloud that morning neared,"
5236,THE 'WANDERER',The swinging wind-vane flashed upon the spire.
5237,THE 'WANDERER',
5238,THE 'WANDERER',"And soon men looked upon a glittering earth,"
5239,THE 'WANDERER',Intensely sparkling like a world new-born;
5240,THE 'WANDERER',"Only to look was spiritual birth,"
5241,THE 'WANDERER',So bright the raindrops ran along the thorn.
5242,THE 'WANDERER',
5243,THE 'WANDERER',"So bright they were, that one could almost pass"
5244,THE 'WANDERER',"Beyond their twinkling to the source, and know"
5245,THE 'WANDERER',"The glory pushing in the blade of grass,"
5246,THE 'WANDERER',That hidden soul which makes the flowers grow.
5247,THE 'WANDERER',
5248,THE 'WANDERER',"That soul was there apparent, not revealed;"
5249,THE 'WANDERER',Unearthly meanings covered every tree;
5250,THE 'WANDERER',That wet grass grew in an immortal field;
5251,THE 'WANDERER',Those waters fed some never-wrinkled sea.
5252,THE 'WANDERER',
5253,THE 'WANDERER',The scarlet berries in the hedge stood out
5254,THE 'WANDERER',"Like revelations, but the tongue unknown;"
5255,THE 'WANDERER',Even in the brooks a joy was quick; the trout
5256,THE 'WANDERER',Rushed in a dumbness dumb to me alone.
5257,THE 'WANDERER',
5258,THE 'WANDERER',All of the valley was aloud with brooks;
5259,THE 'WANDERER',"I walked the morning, breasting up the fells,"
5260,THE 'WANDERER',"Taking again lost childhood from the rooks,"
5261,THE 'WANDERER',Whose cawing came above the Christmas bells.
5262,THE 'WANDERER',
5263,THE 'WANDERER',"I had not walked that glittering world before,"
5264,THE 'WANDERER',"But up the hill a prompting came to me,"
5265,THE 'WANDERER','This line of upland runs along the shore:
5266,THE 'WANDERER',Beyond the hedgerow I shall see the sea.'
5267,THE 'WANDERER',
5268,THE 'WANDERER',And on the instant from beyond away
5269,THE 'WANDERER',"That long familiar sound, a ship's bell, broke"
5270,THE 'WANDERER',The hush below me in the unseen bay.
5271,THE 'WANDERER',Old memories came: that inner prompting spoke.
5272,THE 'WANDERER',
5273,THE 'WANDERER',And bright above the hedge a seagull's wings
5274,THE 'WANDERER',Flashed and were steady upon empty air.
5275,THE 'WANDERER',"'A Power unseen,' I cried, 'prepares these things;"
5276,THE 'WANDERER',"'Those are her bells, the 'Wanderer' is there.'"
5277,THE 'WANDERER',
5278,THE 'WANDERER',"So, hurrying to the hedge and looking down,"
5279,THE 'WANDERER',I saw a mighty bay's wind-crinkled blue
5280,THE 'WANDERER',"Ruffling the image of a tranquil town,"
5281,THE 'WANDERER',With lapsing waters glittering as they grew.
5282,THE 'WANDERER',
5283,THE 'WANDERER',"And near me in the road the shipping swung,"
5284,THE 'WANDERER',So stately and so still in such great peace
5285,THE 'WANDERER',"That like to drooping crests their colours hung,"
5286,THE 'WANDERER',Only their shadows trembled without cease.
5287,THE 'WANDERER',
5288,THE 'WANDERER',I did but glance upon those anchored ships.
5289,THE 'WANDERER',"Even as my thought had told, I saw her plain;"
5290,THE 'WANDERER',"Tense, like a supple athlete with lean hips,"
5291,THE 'WANDERER',"Swiftness at pause, the 'Wanderer' come again--"
5292,THE 'WANDERER',
5293,THE 'WANDERER',"Come as of old a queen, untouched by Time,"
5294,THE 'WANDERER',"Resting the beauty that no seas could tire,"
5295,THE 'WANDERER',"Sparkling, as though the midnight's rain were rime,"
5296,THE 'WANDERER',Like a man's thought transfigured into fire.
5297,THE 'WANDERER',
5298,THE 'WANDERER',"And as I looked, one of her men began"
5299,THE 'WANDERER',To sing some simple tune of Christmas Day;
5300,THE 'WANDERER',"Among her crew the song spread, man to man,"
5301,THE 'WANDERER',Until the singing rang across the bay;
5302,THE 'WANDERER',
5303,THE 'WANDERER',And soon in other anchored ships the men
5304,THE 'WANDERER',"Joined in the singing with clear throats, until"
5305,THE 'WANDERER',"The farm-boy heard it up the windy glen,"
5306,THE 'WANDERER',Above the noise of sheep-bells on the hill.
5307,THE 'WANDERER',
5308,THE 'WANDERER',Over the water came the lifted song--
5309,THE 'WANDERER',Blind pieces in a mighty game we swing;
5310,THE 'WANDERER',Life's battle is a conquest for the strong;
5311,THE 'WANDERER',The meaning shows in the defeated thing.

5420,CHILDREN OF LOVE,Went from his mother out in the cool of the day
5421,CHILDREN OF LOVE,Over the sun-parched fields
5422,CHILDREN OF LOVE,And in among the olives shining green and shining grey.
5423,CHILDREN OF LOVE,
5424,CHILDREN OF LOVE,"There was no sound,"
5425,CHILDREN OF LOVE,No smallest voice of any shivering stream.
5426,CHILDREN OF LOVE,"Poor sinless little boy,"
5427,CHILDREN OF LOVE,He desired to play and to sing; he could only sigh and dream.
5428,CHILDREN OF LOVE,
5429,CHILDREN OF LOVE,Suddenly came
5430,CHILDREN OF LOVE,"Running along to him naked, with curly hair,"
5431,CHILDREN OF LOVE,"That rogue of the lovely world,"
5432,CHILDREN OF LOVE,That other beautiful child whom the virgin Venus bare.
5433,CHILDREN OF LOVE,
5434,CHILDREN OF LOVE,The holy boy
5435,CHILDREN OF LOVE,Gazed with those sad blue eyes that all men know.
5436,CHILDREN OF LOVE,Impudent Cupid stood
5437,CHILDREN OF LOVE,"Panting, holding an arrow and pointing his bow."
5438,CHILDREN OF LOVE,
5439,CHILDREN OF LOVE,(Will you not play?

5443,CHILDREN OF LOVE,

5445,CHILDREN OF LOVE,Watching one another with timid gaze;

5448,CHILDREN OF LOVE,
5449,CHILDREN OF LOVE,Cupid at last

5453,CHILDREN OF LOVE,
5454,CHILDREN OF LOVE,"Now, for delight,"
5455,CHILDREN OF LOVE,Cupid tosses his locks and goes wantonly near;
5456,CHILDREN OF LOVE,But the child that was born to the cross
5457,CHILDREN OF LOVE,"Has let fall on his cheek, for the sadness of life, a compassionate tear."
5458,CHILDREN OF LOVE,
5459,CHILDREN OF LOVE,Marvellous dream!
5460,CHILDREN OF LOVE,Cupid has offered his arrows for Jesus to try;

5731,ACT I,Haven't you brought your flute? We've all got room
5732,ACT I,"For music in our minds to-night, I'll swear."
5733,ACT I,Working all day in the sun do seem to push
5734,ACT I,The thought out of your brain.
5735,ACT I,

5737,ACT I,Sollers:
5738,ACT I,
5739,ACT I,"O, 'tis the sun"
5740,ACT I,Has trodden on you? That's what makes you croak?
5741,ACT I,"Ay, whistle him somewhat: put a tune in his brain;"
5742,ACT I,He'll else croak us out of pleasure with drinking.
5743,ACT I,

5759,ACT I,This is no weather for a man to play
5760,ACT I,Flutes or music at all that asks him spend

5792,ACT I,Is it for can't or won't you are?
5793,ACT I,

5811,ACT I,
5812,ACT I,Huff:
5813,ACT I,
5814,ACT I,Now ain't that just the way we go down here?
5815,ACT I,"Here in the valley we're like dogs in a yard,"
5816,ACT I,"Chained to our kennels and wall'd in all round,"
5817,ACT I,And not a sound of the world jumps over our hills.
5818,ACT I,"And when there comes a passenger among us,"
5819,ACT I,"One who has heard what's stirring out beyond,"
5820,ACT I,'Tis a grutchy mumchance fellow in the dismals!

5826,ACT I,"I wonder, did you ever hate to feel"

5843,ACT I,Your old hell fire about that pair of sinners.
5844,ACT I,Leave them alone and drink.
5845,ACT I,
5846,ACT I,
5847,ACT I,Huff:
5848,ACT I,
5849,ACT I,I'll smell them grilling
5850,ACT I,One of these days.
5851,ACT I,
5852,ACT I,
5853,ACT I,Merrick:
5854,ACT I,
5855,ACT I,But there'll be nought to drink
5856,ACT I,When that begins! Best keep your skin full now.
5857,ACT I,
5858,ACT I,
5859,ACT I,Stranger:
5860,ACT I,
5861,ACT I,What do I care for wickedness? Let those
5862,ACT I,"Who've played with dirt, and thought the game was bold,"
5863,ACT I,Make much of it while they can: there's a big thing
5864,ACT I,"Coming down to us, ay, well on its road,"
5865,ACT I,Will make their ploys seem mighty piddling sport.
5866,ACT I,
5867,ACT I,
5868,ACT I,Huff:
5869,ACT I,
5870,ACT I,"This is a fool; or else it's what I think,--"
5871,ACT I,The world now breeds such crowd that they've no room
5872,ACT I,For well-grown sins: they hatch 'em small as flies.
5873,ACT I,"But you stay here, out of the world awhile,"
5874,ACT I,"Here where a man's mind, and a woman's mind,"
5875,ACT I,Can fling out large in wickedness: you'll see
5876,ACT I,"Something monstrous here, something dreadful."
5877,ACT I,
5878,ACT I,
5879,ACT I,Stranger:
5880,ACT I,
5881,ACT I,I've seen enough of that. Though it was only
5882,ACT I,"Fancying made me see it, it was enough:"
5883,ACT I,"I've seen the folk of the world yelling aghast,"
5884,ACT I,Scurrying to hide themselves. I want nought else
5885,ACT I,Monstrous and dreadful.--

5887,ACT I,
5888,ACT I,Merrick:
5889,ACT I,
5890,ACT I,What had roused 'em so?
5891,ACT I,Some house afire?
5892,ACT I,
5893,ACT I,
5894,ACT I,Huff:
5895,ACT I,
5896,ACT I,A huzzy flogged to death
5897,ACT I,For her hard-faced adultery?
5898,ACT I,
5899,ACT I,
5900,ACT I,Stranger (too intent to hear them):
5901,ACT I,
5902,ACT I,Oh to think of it!
5903,ACT I,"Talk, do, chatter some nonsense, else I'll think:"
5904,ACT I,And then I'm feeling like a grub that crawls
5905,ACT I,All abroad in a dusty road; and high
5906,ACT I,"Above me, and shaking the ground beneath me, come"
5907,ACT I,"Wheels of a thundering wain, right where I'm plodding."
5908,ACT I,
5909,ACT I,

5913,ACT I,
5914,ACT I,
5915,ACT I,Stranger:
5916,ACT I,
5917,ACT I,And here's a queerer thing.
5918,ACT I,"I have a sort of lust in me, pushing me still"
5919,ACT I,"Into that terrible way of thinking, like"
5920,ACT I,Black men in India lie them down and long
5921,ACT I,To feel their holy wagon crack their spines.
5922,ACT I,
5923,ACT I,
5924,ACT I,Merrick:
5925,ACT I,
5926,ACT I,"Do you mean beetles? I've driven over scores,"
5927,ACT I,"They sprawling on their backs, or standing mazed."
5928,ACT I,I never knew they liked it.
5929,ACT I,
5930,ACT I,
5931,ACT I,Sollers:
5932,ACT I,
5933,ACT I,He means frogs.
5934,ACT I,I know what's in his mind. When I was young
5935,ACT I,"My mother would catch us frogs and set them down,"
5936,ACT I,"Lapt in a screw of paper, in the ruts,"
5937,ACT I,"And carts going by would quash 'em; and I'ld laugh,"
5938,ACT I,"And yet be thinking, 'Suppose it was myself"
5939,ACT I,"Twisted stiff in huge paper, and wheels"
5940,ACT I,Big as the wall of a barn treading me flat!'
5941,ACT I,
5942,ACT I,
5943,ACT I,Huff:
5944,ACT I,
5945,ACT I,I know what's in his mind: just madness it is.
5946,ACT I,He's lookt too hard at his fellows in the world;
5947,ACT I,"Sight of their monstrous hearts, like devils in cages,"
5948,ACT I,Has jolted all the gearing of his wits.
5949,ACT I,"It needs a tough brain, ay, a brain like mine,"
5950,ACT I,To pore on ugly sin and not go mad.
5951,ACT I,
5952,ACT I,
5953,ACT I,Stranger:
5954,ACT I,
5955,ACT I,Madness! You're not far out.--I came up here
5956,ACT I,"To be alone and quiet in my thoughts,"
5957,ACT I,"Alone in my own dreadful mind. The path,"
5958,ACT I,"Of red sand trodden hard, went up between"
5959,ACT I,High hedges overgrown of hawthorn blowing
5960,ACT I,White as clouds; ay it seemed burrowed through
5961,ACT I,"A white sweet-smelling cloud,--I walking there"
5962,ACT I,Small as a hare that runs its tunnelled drove
5963,ACT I,Thro' the close heather. And beside my feet
5964,ACT I,Blue greygles drifted gleaming over the grass;
5965,ACT I,"And up I climbed to sunlight green in birches,"
5966,ACT I,And the path turned to daisies among grass
5967,ACT I,"With bonfires of the broom beside, like flame"
5968,ACT I,Of burning straw: and I lookt into your valley.
5969,ACT I,I could scarce look.
5970,ACT I,Anger was smarting in my eyes like grit.
5971,ACT I,O the fine earth and fine all for nothing!
5972,ACT I,"Mazed I walkt, seeing and smelling and hearing:"
5973,ACT I,"The meadow lands all shining fearfully gold,--"
5974,ACT I,Cruel as fire the sight of them toucht my mind;
5975,ACT I,Breathing was all a honey taste of clover
5976,ACT I,And bean flowers: I would have rather had it
5977,ACT I,"Carrion, or the stink of smouldering brimstone."
5978,ACT I,"And larks aloft, the happy piping fools,"
5979,ACT I,"And squealing swifts that slid on hissing wings,"
5980,ACT I,And yellowhammers playing spry in hedges.
5981,ACT I,I never noted them before; but now--
5982,ACT I,"Yes, I was mad, and crying mad, to see"
5983,ACT I,"The earth so fine, fine all for nothing!"
5984,ACT I,
5985,ACT I,
5986,ACT I,Sollers (spits):
5987,ACT I,
5988,ACT I,Pst! yellowhammers! He talks gentry talk.
5989,ACT I,That's worse than being mad.

5992,ACT I,Stranger:
5993,ACT I,
5994,ACT I,"I tell you, you'll be feeling them to-morn"
5995,ACT I,And hating them to be so wonderful.
5996,ACT I,

6011,ACT I,"Why, what's your trade?"
6012,ACT I,
6013,ACT I,Stranger:

6026,ACT I,
6027,ACT I,
6028,ACT I,Huff:
6029,ACT I,
6030,ACT I,"Ho, this is better than a fiddler now!"
6031,ACT I,One of those fellows who have nerves so clever
6032,ACT I,That they can feel the waters of underground
6033,ACT I,Tingling in their fingers.
6034,ACT I,"You find me a spring in my high grazing-field,"
6035,ACT I,I'll give you what I save in trundling water.
6036,ACT I,
6037,ACT I,
6038,ACT I,Stranger:
6039,ACT I,
6040,ACT I,"I find you water now!---No, but I'll find you"
6041,ACT I,Fire and fear and unbelievable death.

6149,ACT I,
6150,ACT I,A Russian bear?
6151,ACT I,

6161,ACT I,
6162,ACT I,
6163,ACT I,Dowser:
6164,ACT I,
6165,ACT I,This is a trick to rouse the world.

6169,ACT I,

6171,ACT I,Look out! Between the elms! There's my fierce thing.
6172,ACT I,
6173,ACT I,
6174,ACT I,Merrick:
6175,ACT I,
6176,ACT I,He means the star with the tail like a feather of fire.
6177,ACT I,

6190,ACT I,
6191,ACT I,What do you think of it?
6192,ACT I,
6193,ACT I,
6194,ACT I,Huff:
6195,ACT I,
6196,ACT I,Pretty enough.
6197,ACT I,But I saw a man loose off a rocket once;
6198,ACT I,It made more stir and flare of itself; though yon
6199,ACT I,Does better at steady burning.
6200,ACT I,
6201,ACT I,
6202,ACT I,Dowser:
6203,ACT I,
6204,ACT I,Stir and flare!
6205,ACT I,You'll soon forget your rocket.
6206,ACT I,

6208,ACT I,Merrick:
6209,ACT I,
6210,ACT I,Tell you what
6211,ACT I,"I thought last night, now, going home. Says I,"
6212,ACT I,'Tis just like the look of a tadpole: if I saw
6213,ACT I,A tadpole silver as a dace that swam
6214,ACT I,"Upside-down towards me through black water,"
6215,ACT I,I'ld see the plain spit of that star and his tail.
6216,ACT I,
6217,ACT I,
6218,ACT I,Sollers:
6219,ACT I,
6220,ACT I,And how does your thought go?

6224,ACT I,
6225,ACT I,It's what I know!--
6226,ACT I,"A tadpole and a rocket!--My dear God,"
6227,ACT I,And I can still laugh out!--What do you think
6228,ACT I,Your tadpole's made of? What lets your rocket fling
6229,ACT I,"Those streaming sparks across the half of night,"
6230,ACT I,Splashing the burning spray of its haste among
6231,ACT I,The quiet business of the other stars?
6232,ACT I,"Ay, that's a fiery jet it leaves behind"
6233,ACT I,In such enormous drift! What sort of fire
6234,ACT I,"Is spouted so, spouted and never quenching?--"
6235,ACT I,There is no name for that star's fire: it is
6236,ACT I,"The fire that was before the world was made,"
6237,ACT I,The fire that all the things we live among
6238,ACT I,Remember being; and whitest fire we know
6239,ACT I,Is its poor copy in their dreaming trance!
6240,ACT I,
6241,ACT I,
6242,ACT I,Huff:
6243,ACT I,
6244,ACT I,That would be hell fire.
6245,ACT I,
6246,ACT I,
6247,ACT I,Dowser:
6248,ACT I,
6249,ACT I,"Ay, if you like, hell fire,"
6250,ACT I,Hell fire flying through the night! 'Twould be
6251,ACT I,"A thing to blink about, a blast of it"
6252,ACT I,"Swept in your face, eh? and a thing to set"
6253,ACT I,The whole stuff of the earth smoking rarely?
6254,ACT I,Which of you said 'the heat's a wonder to-night'?
6255,ACT I,You have not done with marvelling. There'll come
6256,ACT I,"A night when all your clothes are a pickle of sweat,"
6257,ACT I,"And, for all that, the sweat on your salty skin"
6258,ACT I,"Shall dry and crack, in the breathing of a wind"
6259,ACT I,That's like a draught come through an open'd furnace.
6260,ACT I,"The leafage of the trees shall brown and faint,"
6261,ACT I,All sappy growth turning to brittle rubbish
6262,ACT I,As the near heat of the star strokes the green earth;
6263,ACT I,And time shall brush the fields as visibly
6264,ACT I,As a rough hand brushes against the nap
6265,ACT I,"Of gleaming cloth--killing the season's colour,"
6266,ACT I,Each hour charged with the wasting of a year;
6267,ACT I,And sailors panting on their warping decks
6268,ACT I,Will watch the sea steam like broth about them.
6269,ACT I,You'll know what I know then!--That towering star
6270,ACT I,Hangs like a fiery buzzard in the night
6271,ACT I,"Intent over our earth--Ay, now his journey"
6272,ACT I,"Points, straight as a plummet's drop, down to us!"
6273,ACT I,
6274,ACT I,
6275,ACT I,Huff:
6276,ACT I,
6277,ACT I,"Why, that's the end of the world!"
6278,ACT I,
6279,ACT I,
6280,ACT I,Dowser:
6281,ACT I,
6282,ACT I,You've said it now.
6283,ACT I,
6284,ACT I,
6285,ACT I,Sollers:
6286,ACT I,
6287,ACT I,"What, soon? In a day or two?"
6288,ACT I,
6289,ACT I,
6290,ACT I,Merrick:
6291,ACT I,
6292,ACT I,You can't mean that!
6293,ACT I,
6294,ACT I,
6295,ACT I,Vine:
6296,ACT I,
6297,ACT I,"End of the World! Well now, I never thought"
6298,ACT I,To hear the news of that. If you've the truth
6299,ACT I,"In what you say, likely this is an evening"
6300,ACT I,That we'll be talking over often and often.
6301,ACT I,"'How was it, Sellers?' I'll say; 'or you, Merrick,"
6302,ACT I,Do you mind clearly how he lookt?'--And then--
6303,ACT I,"""End of the world"" he said, and drank--like that,"
6304,ACT I,Solemn!'--And right he was: he had it all
6305,ACT I,As sure as I have when my sow's to farrow.
6306,ACT I,
6307,ACT I,
6308,ACT I,Dowser:
6309,ACT I,
6310,ACT I,Are you making a joke of me? Keep your mind
6311,ACT I,For tippling while you can.
6312,ACT I,
6313,ACT I,
6314,ACT I,Vine:
6315,ACT I,
6316,ACT I,Was that a joke?
6317,ACT I,"I'm always bad at seeing 'em, even my own."
6318,ACT I,
6319,ACT I,
6320,ACT I,Dowser:
6321,ACT I,
6322,ACT I,A fool's! 'Twill cheer you when the earth blows up.
6323,ACT I,Like as it were all gunpowder.
6324,ACT I,
6325,ACT I,
6326,ACT I,Vine:
6327,ACT I,
6328,ACT I,You mean
6329,ACT I,The star will butt his burning head against us?
6330,ACT I,"'Twill knock the world to flinders, I suppose?"
6331,ACT I,
6332,ACT I,
6333,ACT I,Dowser:
6334,ACT I,
6335,ACT I,"Ay, or with that wild, monstrous tail of his"
6336,ACT I,"Smash down upon the air, and make it bounce"
6337,ACT I,"Like water under the flukes of a harpooned whale,"
6338,ACT I,And thrash it to a poisonous fire; and we
6339,ACT I,And all the life of the world drowned in blazing!
6340,ACT I,
6341,ACT I,
6342,ACT I,Vine:
6343,ACT I,
6344,ACT I,'Twill be a handsome sight. If my old wife
6345,ACT I,Were with me now! This would have suited her.
6346,ACT I,'I do like things to happen!' she would say;
6347,ACT I,Never shindy enough for her; and now
6348,ACT I,"She's gone, and can't be seeing this!"
6349,ACT I,
6350,ACT I,
6351,ACT I,Dowser:
6352,ACT I,
6353,ACT I,You poor fool.
6354,ACT I,"How will it be a sight to you, when your eyes"
6355,ACT I,Are scorcht to little cinders in your head?
6356,ACT I,
6357,ACT I,
6358,ACT I,Vine:
6359,ACT I,
6360,ACT I,"Whether or no, there must be folks outside"
6361,ACT I,Willing to know of this. I'll scatter your news.
6362,ACT I,
6363,ACT I,
6364,ACT I,[He goes.]
6365,ACT I,
6366,ACT I,[A short-pause: then SOLLERS breaks out.]
6367,ACT I,
6368,ACT I,
6369,ACT I,Sollers:
6370,ACT I,
6371,ACT I,"No, no; it wouldn't do for me at all;"
6372,ACT I,"Nor for you neither, Merrick? End of the World?"
6373,ACT I,Bogy! A parson's tale or a bairn's!
6374,ACT I,
6375,ACT I,
6376,ACT I,Merrick:
6377,ACT I,
6378,ACT I,That's it.
6379,ACT I,"Your trade's a gift, easy as playing tunes."
6380,ACT I,"But Sollers here and I, we've had to drill"
6381,ACT I,"Sinew and muscle into their hard lesson,"
6382,ACT I,Until they work in timber and glowing iron
6383,ACT I,As kindly as I pick up my pint: your work
6384,ACT I,"Grows in your nature, like plain speech in a child,"
6385,ACT I,But we have learnt to think in a foreign tongue;
6386,ACT I,And something must come out of all our skill!
6387,ACT I,We shan't go sliding down as glib as you
6388,ACT I,Into notions of the End of the World.
6389,ACT I,
6390,ACT I,
6391,ACT I,Sollers:
6392,ACT I,
6393,ACT I,"Give me a tree, you may say, and give me steel,"
6394,ACT I,"And I'll put forth my shapely mind; I'll make,"
6395,ACT I,"Out of my head like telling a well-known tale,"
6396,ACT I,A wain that goes as comely on the roads
6397,ACT I,"As a ship sailing, the lines of it true as gospel."
6398,ACT I,Have I learnt that all for nothing?--O no!
6399,ACT I,End of the World? It wouldn't do at all.
6400,ACT I,"No more making of wains, after I've spent"
6401,ACT I,My time in getting the right skill in my hands?
6402,ACT I,
6403,ACT I,
6404,ACT I,Dowser:
6405,ACT I,
6406,ACT I,"Ay, you begin to feel it now, I think;"
6407,ACT I,But you complain like boys for a game spoilt:
6408,ACT I,"Shaping your carts, forging your iron! But Life,"
6409,ACT I,"Life, the mother who lets her children play"
6410,ACT I,"So seriously busy, trade and craft,--"
6411,ACT I,Life with her skill of a million years' perfection
6412,ACT I,To make her heart's delighted glorying
6413,ACT I,"Of sunlight, and of clouds about the moon,"
6414,ACT I,"Spring lighting her daffodils, and corn"
6415,ACT I,"Ripening gold to ruddy, and giant seas,"
6416,ACT I,And mountains sitting in their purple clothes--
6417,ACT I,"Life I am thinking of, life the wonder,"
6418,ACT I,All blotcht out by a brutal thrust of fire
6419,ACT I,Like a midge that a clumsy thumb squashes and smears.
6420,ACT I,
6421,ACT I,
6422,ACT I,Huff:
6423,ACT I,
6424,ACT I,"Let me but see the show beginning, though!"
6425,ACT I,You'ld mind me then! O I would like you all
6426,ACT I,"To watch how I should figure, when the star"
6427,ACT I,Brandishes over the whole air its flame
6428,ACT I,Of thundering fire; and naught but yellow rubbish
6429,ACT I,"Parcht on the perishing ground, and there are tongues"
6430,ACT I,"Chapt with thirst, glad to lap stinking ponds,"
6431,ACT I,And pale glaring faces spying about
6432,ACT I,"On the earth withering, terror the only speech!"
6433,ACT I,"Look for me then, and see me stand alone"
6434,ACT I,Easy and pleasant in the midst of it all.
6435,ACT I,Did you not make your merry scoff of me?
6436,ACT I,"Was it your talk, that when yon shameless pair"
6437,ACT I,"Threw their wantoning in my face like dirt,"
6438,ACT I,I had no heart against them but to grumble?
6439,ACT I,"You would be saying that, I know! But now,"
6440,ACT I,Now I believe it's time for you to see
6441,ACT I,My patient heart at last taking its wages.
6442,ACT I,
6443,ACT I,
6444,ACT I,Sollers:
6445,ACT I,
6446,ACT I,"Pull up, man! Screw the brake on your running tongue,"
6447,ACT I,Else it will rattle you down the tumbling way
6448,ACT I,This fellow's gone.
6449,ACT I,
6450,ACT I,
6451,ACT I,Merrick:
6452,ACT I,
6453,ACT I,And one man's enough
6454,ACT I,With brain quagged axle-deep in crazy mire.
6455,ACT I,"We won't have you beside him in his puddles,"
6456,ACT I,And calling out with him on the End of the World
6457,ACT I,To heave you out with a vengeance.
6458,ACT I,
6459,ACT I,
6460,ACT I,Huff:
6461,ACT I,
6462,ACT I,What you want!
6463,ACT I,Have I not borne enough to make me know
6464,ACT I,I must be righted sometime?--And what else
6465,ACT I,"Would break the hardy sin in them, which lets"
6466,ACT I,Their souls parade so daring and so tall
6467,ACT I,Under God's hate and mine? What else could pay
6468,ACT I,For all my wrong but a blow of blazing anger
6469,ACT I,"Striking down to shiver the earth, and change"
6470,ACT I,Their strutting wickedness to horror and crying?
6471,ACT I,
6472,ACT I,
6473,ACT I,Merrick:
6474,ACT I,
6475,ACT I,"Be quiet, Huff! If you mean to believe"
6476,ACT I,"This dowser's stuff, and join him in his bedlam,"
6477,ACT I,"By God, you'll have to reckon with my fist."
6478,ACT I,
6479,ACT I,
6480,ACT I,"[SHALE comes in. HUFF glares at him speechless, but with wrath evidently"
6481,ACT I,working.]
6482,ACT I,
6483,ACT I,
6484,ACT I,Shale:
6485,ACT I,
6486,ACT I,"Where's the joker? You, is it? Here's hot news"
6487,ACT I,"You've brought us; all the valley's hissing aloud,"
6488,ACT I,And makes as much of you falling into it
6489,ACT I,As a pail of water would of a glowing coal.
6490,ACT I,
6491,ACT I,
6492,ACT I,Sollers:
6493,ACT I,
6494,ACT I,"Don't you start burbling too, Shale."
6495,ACT I,
6496,ACT I,
6497,ACT I,Shale:
6498,ACT I,
6499,ACT I,That's the word!
6500,ACT I,"Burbling, simmering, ay and bumpy-boiling:"
6501,ACT I,All the women are mobbed together close
6502,ACT I,"Under the witan-trees, and their full minds"
6503,ACT I,Boil like so many pans slung on a fire.
6504,ACT I,"Why, starlings trooping in a copse in fall"
6505,ACT I,Could make no scandal like it.
6506,ACT I,
6507,ACT I,
6508,ACT I,Merrick:
6509,ACT I,
6510,ACT I,"What is it, man?"
6511,ACT I,
6512,ACT I,
6513,ACT I,Shale:
6514,ACT I,
6515,ACT I,End of the World! The flying star! End of the World!
6516,ACT I,
6517,ACT I,
6518,ACT I,Sollers:
6519,ACT I,
6520,ACT I,They don't believe it though?
6521,ACT I,
6522,ACT I,
6523,ACT I,Shale:
6524,ACT I,
6525,ACT I,What? the whole place
6526,ACT I,Has gone just randy over it!
6527,ACT I,
6528,ACT I,
6529,ACT I,Merrick:
6530,ACT I,
6531,ACT I,Hold your noise!
6532,ACT I,
6533,ACT I,
6534,ACT I,Sollers:
6535,ACT I,
6536,ACT I,I shall be daft if this goes on.
6537,ACT I,
6538,ACT I,
6539,ACT I,Shale:
6540,ACT I,
6541,ACT I,"Ay, so?"
6542,ACT I,The End of the World's been here? You look as though
6543,ACT I,You'd startled lately. And there's the virtuous man!
6544,ACT I,"How would End of the World suit our good Huff,"
6545,ACT I,Our old crab-verjuice Huff?
6546,ACT I,
6547,ACT I,
6548,ACT I,HUFF (seizing the DOWSER and bringing him up in front of SHALE):
6549,ACT I,
6550,ACT I,Look at him there!
6551,ACT I,This is the man I told you of when you
6552,ACT I,"Were talking small of sin. You made it out,"
6553,ACT I,"Did you, a fool's mere nasty game, like dogs"
6554,ACT I,"That snuggle in muck, and grin and roll themselves"
6555,ACT I,"With snorting pleasure? Ah, but you are wrong."
6556,ACT I,'Tis something that goes thrusting dreadfully
6557,ACT I,Its wilful bravery of evil against
6558,ACT I,The worth and right of goodness in the world:
6559,ACT I,"Ay, do you see how his face still brags at me?"
6560,ACT I,"And long it has been, the time he's had to walk"
6561,ACT I,Lording about me with his wickedness.
6562,ACT I,"Do you know what he dared? I had a wife,"
6563,ACT I,"A flighty pretty linnet-headed girl,"
6564,ACT I,But mine: he practised on her with his eyes;
6565,ACT I,"He knew of luring glances, and she went"
6566,ACT I,After his calling lust: and all since then
6567,ACT I,"They've lived together, fleering in my face,"
6568,ACT I,Pleased in sight of the windows of my house
6569,ACT I,"With doing wrong, and making my disgrace."
6570,ACT I,O but wait here with me; wait till your news
6571,ACT I,"Is not to be mistaken, for the way"
6572,ACT I,The earth buckles and singes like hot boards:
6573,ACT I,You'll surely see how dreadful sin can be
6574,ACT I,"Then, when you mark these two running about,"
6575,ACT I,With raging fear for what they did against me
6576,ACT I,"Buzzing close to their souls, stinging their hearts,"
6577,ACT I,"And they like scampering beasts when clegs are fierce,"
6578,ACT I,"Or flinging themselves low as the ground to writhe,"
6579,ACT I,Their arms hugging their desperate heads. And then
6580,ACT I,"You'll see what 'tis to be an upright man,"
6581,ACT I,Who keeps a patient anger for his wrongs
6582,ACT I,Thinking of judgment coming--you will see that
6583,ACT I,"When you mark how my looks hunt these wretches,"
6584,ACT I,And smile upon their groans and posturing anguish.
6585,ACT I,"O watch how calm I'll be, when the blazing air"
6586,ACT I,Judges their wickedness; you watch me then
6587,ACT I,"Looking delighted, like a nobleman"
6588,ACT I,Who sees his horse winning an easy race.
6589,ACT I,

6598,ACT I,"You fool,"
6599,ACT I,"Merrick, how should I not believe a thing"
6600,ACT I,"That calls aloud on my mind and spirit, and they"
6601,ACT I,Answer to it like starving conquering soldiers
6602,ACT I,Told to break out and loot?
6603,ACT I,
6604,ACT I,
6605,ACT I,Shale:

6608,ACT I,
6609,ACT I,
6610,ACT I,Sollers:

6614,ACT I,Who pours his will into our minds to see
6615,ACT I,How we can frighten one another.
6616,ACT I,
6617,ACT I,

6619,ACT I,
6620,ACT I,A fiend!

6622,ACT I,"And flaming wings, beating about his head."
6623,ACT I,"There'll be no air for Shale, very soon now,"
6624,ACT I,But the breathing of a fiend: the star's coming!
6625,ACT I,The star that breathes a horrible fury of fire
6626,ACT I,Like glaring fog into the empty night;
6627,ACT I,And in the gust of its wrath the world will soon
6628,ACT I,Shrivel and spin like paper in a furnace.
6629,ACT I,I knew they both would have to pay me at last
6630,ACT I,With sight of their damned souls for all my wrong!
6631,ACT I,
6632,ACT I,
6633,ACT I,Shale:
6634,ACT I,
6635,ACT I,Somebody stop his gab.
6636,ACT I,
6637,ACT I,
6638,ACT I,Merrick (seizing the DOWSER and shaking him):
6639,ACT I,
6640,ACT I,Is it the truth?
6641,ACT I,Is it the truth we're in the way of the star?
6642,ACT I,
6643,ACT I,
6644,ACT I,Sollers:
6645,ACT I,
6646,ACT I,O let us go home; let us go home and sleep!
6647,ACT I,
6648,ACT I,
6649,ACT I,"[A crowd, of men and women burst in and shout confusedly.]"
6650,ACT I,
6651,ACT I,
6652,ACT I,1. Look out for the star!
6653,ACT I,"2.                      'Tis moving, moving."
6654,ACT I,3. Grows as you stare at it.
6655,ACT I,4.                       Bigger than ever.
6656,ACT I,"1. Down it comes with a diving pounce,"
6657,ACT I,As though it had lookt for us and at last found us.
6658,ACT I,2. O so near and coming so quick!
6659,ACT I,3. And how the burning hairs of its tail
6660,ACT I,Do seem surely to quiver for speed.
6661,ACT I,4. We saw its great tail twitch behind it.
6662,ACT I,"'Tis come so near, so gleaming near."
6663,ACT I,1. The tail is wagging!
6664,ACT I,2.                    Come out and see!
6665,ACT I,3. The star is wagging its tail and eyeing us--
6666,ACT I,4. Like a cat huncht to leap on a bird.
6667,ACT I,
6668,ACT I,
6669,ACT I,Merrick:
6670,ACT I,
6671,ACT I,Out of my way and let me see for myself.

6674,ACT I,[They all begin to hustle out: HUFF speaks in midst of the turmoil.]
6675,ACT I,

6678,ACT I,
6679,ACT I,"Ay, now begins the just man's reward;"
6680,ACT I,And hatred of the evil thing
6681,ACT I,Now is to be satisfied.
6682,ACT I,Wrong ventured out against me and braved:
6683,ACT I,And I'll be glad to see all breathing pleasure
6684,ACT I,Burn as foolishly to naught
6685,ACT I,"As a moth in candle flame,"
6686,ACT I,If I but have my will to watch over those
6687,ACT I,Who injured me bawling hoarse heartless fear.

6695,ACT I,"As for you, let you and the women make"
6696,ACT I,Your howling scare of this; I'll stand and laugh.
6697,ACT I,"But if it truly were the End of the World,"
6698,ACT I,"I'ld be the man to face it out, not you:"
6699,ACT I,"I who have let life go delighted through me,"
6700,ACT I,"Not you, who've sulkt away your chance of life"

6707,ACT I,Huff (after him):
6708,ACT I,
6709,ACT I,"You wait, you wait!"
6710,ACT I,
6711,ACT I,[He follows the rest.]
6712,ACT I,
6713,ACT I,
6714,ACT I,Dowser (alone):
6715,ACT I,
6716,ACT I,Naught but a plague of flies!
6717,ACT I,"I cannot do with noises, and light fools"
6718,ACT I,Terrified round me; I must go out and think
6719,ACT I,"Where there is quiet and no one near. O, think!"
6720,ACT I,"Life that has done such wonders with its thinking,"
6721,ACT I,And never daunted in imagining;
6722,ACT I,"That has put on the sun and the shining night,"
6723,ACT I,"The flowering of the earth and tides of the sea,"
6724,ACT I,"And irresistible rage of fate itself,"
6725,ACT I,All these as garments for its spirit's journey--
6726,ACT I,"O now this life, in the brute chance of things,"
6727,ACT I,"Murder'd, uselessly murder'd! And naught else"
6728,ACT I,For ever but senseless rounds of hurrying motion
6729,ACT I,That cannot glory in itself. O no!
6730,ACT I,I will not think of that; I'll blind my brain
6731,ACT I,With fancying the splendours of destruction;
6732,ACT I,When like a burr in the star's fiery mane
6733,ACT I,"The crackling earth is caught and rusht along,"
6734,ACT I,"The forests on the mountains blazing so,"
6735,ACT I,That from the rocks of ore beneath them come
6736,ACT I,White-hot rivers of smelted metal pouring
6737,ACT I,Across the plains to roar into the sea ...
6738,ACT I,
6739,ACT I,
6740,ACT I,[The curtain is lowered for a few moments only.]
6741,ACT I,
6742,ACT I,
6743,ACT I,
6744,ACT II,ACT II
6745,ACT II,
6746,ACT II,
6747,ACT II,"[As before, a little while after. The room is empty when the curtain"
6748,ACT II,"goes up. SOLLERS runs in and paces about, but stops short when he"
6749,ACT II,catches sight of a pot dog on the mantelpiece.]
6750,ACT II,
6751,ACT II,
6752,ACT II,Sollers:
6753,ACT II,
6754,ACT II,The pace it is coming down!--What to do now?--
6755,ACT II,My brain has stopt: it's like a clock that's fallen
6756,ACT II,Out of a window and broke all its cogs.--Where's
6757,ACT II,"That old cider, Vine would have us pay"
6758,ACT II,Twopence a glass for? Let's try how it smells:
6759,ACT II,"Old Foxwhelp, and a humming stingo it is!"
6760,ACT II,(To the pot dog)
6761,ACT II,"Hullo, you! What are you grinning at?--"
6762,ACT II,I know!
6763,ACT II,There'll be no score against me for this drink!
6764,ACT II,O that score! I've drunk it down for a week
6765,ACT II,"With every gulp of cider, and every gulp"
6766,ACT II,"Was half the beauty it should have been, the score"
6767,ACT II,"So scratcht my swallowing throat, like a wasp in the drink!"
6768,ACT II,And I need never have heeded it!--
6769,ACT II,Old grinning dog! You've seen me happy here;
6770,ACT II,"And now, all's done! But do you know this too,"
6771,ACT II,"That I can break you now, and never called"
6772,ACT II,To pay for you?
6773,ACT II,[Throwing the dog on the floor]
6774,ACT II,I shall be savage soon!
6775,ACT II,"We're leaving all this!--O, and it was so pleasant"
6776,ACT II,"Here, in here, of an evening.----Smash!"
6777,ACT II,[He sweeps a lot of crockery on to the floor.]
6778,ACT II,It's all no good! Let's make a wreck of it all!
6779,ACT II,[Picking up a chair and swinging it.]
6780,ACT II,"Damn me! Now I'm forgetting to drink, and soon"
6781,ACT II,'Twill be too late. Where's there a mug not shivered?
6782,ACT II,
6783,ACT II,
6784,ACT II,[He goes to draw himself cider. MERRICK rushes in.]
6785,ACT II,
6786,ACT II,
6787,ACT II,Merrick:
6788,ACT II,
6789,ACT II,You at the barrels too? Out of the road!
6790,ACT II,
6791,ACT II,
6792,ACT II,[He pushes SOLLERS away and spills his mug.]
6793,ACT II,
6794,ACT II,
6795,ACT II,Sollers:
6796,ACT II,
6797,ACT II,"Go and kick out of doors, you black donkey."
6798,ACT II,
6799,ACT II,
6800,ACT II,Merrick:
6801,ACT II,
6802,ACT II,"Let me come at the vessel, will you?"
6803,ACT II,
6804,ACT II,
6805,ACT II,[They wrestle savagely.]
6806,ACT II,
6807,ACT II,
6808,ACT II,Sollers:
6809,ACT II,
6810,ACT II,Keep off;
6811,ACT II,I'm the first here. Lap what you've spilt of mine.
6812,ACT II,
6813,ACT II,
6814,ACT II,Merrick:
6815,ACT II,
6816,ACT II,"You with your chiselling and screw-driving,"
6817,ACT II,"Your wooden work, you bidding me, the man"
6818,ACT II,Who hammers a meaning into red hot iron?
6819,ACT II,
6820,ACT II,
6821,ACT II,[VINE comes in slowly. He is weeping; the two wrestlers stop and stare
6822,ACT II,"at him, as he sits down, and holds his head in his hands, sobbing.]"
6823,ACT II,
6824,ACT II,
6825,ACT II,Vine:
6826,ACT II,
6827,ACT II,O this is a cruel affair!
6828,ACT II,
6829,ACT II,
6830,ACT II,Sollers:
6831,ACT II,
6832,ACT II,Here's Vine crying!
6833,ACT II,
6834,ACT II,
6835,ACT II,Vine:
6836,ACT II,
6837,ACT II,I've seen the moon.
6838,ACT II,
6839,ACT II,
6840,ACT II,Merrick:
6841,ACT II,
6842,ACT II,The moon? 'Tisn't the moon
6843,ACT II,"That's tumbling on us, but yon raging star."
6844,ACT II,What notion now is clotted in your head?
6845,ACT II,
6846,ACT II,
6847,ACT II,Vine:
6848,ACT II,
6849,ACT II,I've seen the moon; it has nigh broke my heart.
6850,ACT II,
6851,ACT II,
6852,ACT II,Sollers:
6853,ACT II,
6854,ACT II,Not the moon too jumping out of her ways?
6855,ACT II,
6856,ACT II,
6857,ACT II,Vine:
6858,ACT II,
6859,ACT II,"No, no;--but going quietly and shining,"
6860,ACT II,Pushing away a flimsy gentle cloud
6861,ACT II,"That would drift smoky round her, fending it off"
6862,ACT II,With steady rounds of blue and yellow light.
6863,ACT II,It was not much to see. She was no more
6864,ACT II,Than a curved bit of silver rind. But I
6865,ACT II,Never before so noted her--
6866,ACT II,
6867,ACT II,
6868,ACT II,Sollers:
6869,ACT II,
6870,ACT II,"What he said,"
6871,ACT II,The dowser!
6872,ACT II,
6873,ACT II,
6874,ACT II,Merrick:
6875,ACT II,
6876,ACT II,"Ay, about his yellowhammers."
6877,ACT II,
6878,ACT II,
6879,ACT II,Sollers:
6880,ACT II,
6881,ACT II,And there's a kind of stifle in the air
6882,ACT II,Already!
6883,ACT II,
6884,ACT II,
6885,ACT II,Merrick:
6886,ACT II,
6887,ACT II,"It seems to me, my breathing goes"
6888,ACT II,"All hot down my windpipe, hot as cider"
6889,ACT II,Mulled and steaming travels down my swallow.
6890,ACT II,
6891,ACT II,
6892,ACT II,Sollers:
6893,ACT II,
6894,ACT II,And a queer racing through my ears of blood.
6895,ACT II,
6896,ACT II,
6897,ACT II,Merrick:
6898,ACT II,
6899,ACT II,"I wonder, is the star come closer still?"
6900,ACT II,
6901,ACT II,
6902,ACT II,Sollers:
6903,ACT II,
6904,ACT II,"O, close, I know, and viciously heading down."
6905,ACT II,
6906,ACT II,
6907,ACT II,Vine:
6908,ACT II,
6909,ACT II,She was so silver! and the sun had left
6910,ACT II,"A kind of tawny red, a dust of fine"
6911,ACT II,"Thin light upon the blue where she was lying,--"
6912,ACT II,"Just a curled paring of the moon, amid"
6913,ACT II,The faint grey cloud that set the gleaming wheel
6914,ACT II,Around the tilted slip of shining silver.
6915,ACT II,"O it did seem to me so safe and homely,"
6916,ACT II,The moon quietly going about the earth;
6917,ACT II,"It's a rare place we have to live in, here;"
6918,ACT II,And life is such a comfortable thing--
6919,ACT II,And what's the sense of it all? Naught but to make
6920,ACT II,Cruel as may be the slaughtering of it.
6921,ACT II,
6922,ACT II,
6923,ACT II,[He breaks down again.]
6924,ACT II,
6925,ACT II,
6926,ACT II,Sollers:
6927,ACT II,
6928,ACT II,It heats my mind!
6929,ACT II,
6930,ACT II,
6931,ACT II,[He begins to walk up and down desperately.]
6932,ACT II,
6933,ACT II,
6934,ACT II,Merrick:
6935,ACT II,
6936,ACT II,"'Twas bound to come sometime,"
6937,ACT II,"Bound to come, I suppose. 'Tis a poor thing"
6938,ACT II,"For us, to fall plumb in the chance of it;"
6939,ACT II,"But, now or another time, 'twas bound to be.--"
6940,ACT II,I have been thinking back. When I was a lad
6941,ACT II,I was delighted with my life: there seemed
6942,ACT II,Naught but things to enjoy. Say we were bathing:
6943,ACT II,"There'ld be the cool smell of the water, and cool"
6944,ACT II,The splashing under the trees: but I did loathe
6945,ACT II,"The sinking mud slithering round my feet,"
6946,ACT II,And I did love to loathe it so! And then
6947,ACT II,We'ld troop to kill a wasp's nest; and for sure
6948,ACT II,I would be stung; and if I liked the dusk
6949,ACT II,"And singing and the game of it all, I loved"
6950,ACT II,"The smart of the stings, and fleeing the buzzing furies."
6951,ACT II,And sometimes I'ld be looking at myself
6952,ACT II,Making so much of everything; there'ld seem
6953,ACT II,A part of me speaking about myself:
6954,ACT II,"'You know, this is much more than being happy."
6955,ACT II,"'Tis hunger of some power in you, that lives"
6956,ACT II,"On your heart's welcome for all sorts of luck,"
6957,ACT II,But always looks beyond you for its meaning.'
6958,ACT II,"And that's the way the world's kept going on,"
6959,ACT II,I believe now. Misery and delight
6960,ACT II,"Have both had liking welcome from it, both"
6961,ACT II,Have made the world keen to be glad and sorry.
6962,ACT II,For why? It felt the living power thrive
6963,ACT II,"The more it made everything, good and bad,"
6964,ACT II,"Its own belonging, forged to its own affair,--"
6965,ACT II,The living power that would do wonders some day.
6966,ACT II,I don't know if you take me?
6967,ACT II,
6968,ACT II,
6969,ACT II,Sollers:
6970,ACT II,
6971,ACT II,"I do, fine;"
6972,ACT II,I've felt the very thought go through my mind
6973,ACT II,When I was at my wains; though 'twas a thing
6974,ACT II,Of such a flight I could not read its colour.--
6975,ACT II,Why was I like a man sworn to a thing
6976,ACT II,"Working to have my wains in every curve,"
6977,ACT II,"Ay, every tenon, right and as they should be?"
6978,ACT II,"Not for myself, not even for those wains:"
6979,ACT II,But to keep in me living at its best
6980,ACT II,"The skill that must go forward and shape the world,"
6981,ACT II,Helping it on to make some masterpiece.
6982,ACT II,
6983,ACT II,
6984,ACT II,Merrick:
6985,ACT II,
6986,ACT II,And never was there aught to come of it!
6987,ACT II,The world was always looking to use its life
6988,ACT II,In some great handsome way at last. And now--
6989,ACT II,We are just fooled. There never was any good
6990,ACT II,In the world going on or being at all.
6991,ACT II,The fine things life has plotted to do are worth
6992,ACT II,A rotten toadstool kickt to flying bits.
6993,ACT II,"End of the World? Ay, and the end of a joke."
6994,ACT II,
6995,ACT II,
6996,ACT II,Vine:
6997,ACT II,
6998,ACT II,"Well, Huff's the man for this turn."
6999,ACT II,
7000,ACT II,
7001,ACT II,Merrick:
7002,ACT II,
7003,ACT II,"Ay, the good man!"
7004,ACT II,He could but grunt when times were pleasant; now
7005,ACT II,There's misery enough to make him trumpet.
7006,ACT II,"And yet, by God, he shan't come blowing his horn"
7007,ACT II,Over my misery!
7008,ACT II,"We are just fooled, did I say?--We fooled ourselves,"
7009,ACT II,Looking for worth in what was still to come;
7010,ACT II,"And now there's a stop to our innings. Well, that's fair:"
7011,ACT II,"I've been a living man, and might have been"
7012,ACT II,"Nothing at all! I've had the world about me,"
7013,ACT II,And felt it as my own concern. What else
7014,ACT II,Should I be crying for? I've had my turn.
7015,ACT II,"The world may be for the sake of naught at last,"
7016,ACT II,But it has been for my sake: I've had that.
7017,ACT II,
7018,ACT II,
7019,ACT II,"[He sits again, and broods.]"
7020,ACT II,
7021,ACT II,
7022,ACT II,Sollers:
7023,ACT II,
7024,ACT II,I can't stay here. I must be where my sight
7025,ACT II,May silence with its business all my thinking--
7026,ACT II,Though it will be the star plunged down so close
7027,ACT II,It puffs its flaming vengeance in my face.
7028,ACT II,
7029,ACT II,
7030,ACT II,[He goes.]
7031,ACT II,
7032,ACT II,
7033,ACT II,Vine:
7034,ACT II,
7035,ACT II,"I wish there were someone who had done me wrong,"
7036,ACT II,Like Huff with his wife and Shale; I wish there were
7037,ACT II,Somebody I would like to see go crazed
7038,ACT II,With staring fright. I'ld have my pleasure then
7039,ACT II,Of living on into the End of the World.
7040,ACT II,"But there is no one at all for me, no one"
7041,ACT II,Now my poor wife is gone.
7042,ACT II,
7043,ACT II,
7044,ACT II,Merrick:
7045,ACT II,
7046,ACT II,"Why, what did she"
7047,ACT II,To harm you?
7048,ACT II,
7049,ACT II,
7050,ACT II,Vine:
7051,ACT II,
7052,ACT II,Didn't she marry me?--It's true
7053,ACT II,She made it come all right. She died at last.
7054,ACT II,"Besides, it would be wasting wishes on her,"
7055,ACT II,To be in hopes of her weeping at this.
7056,ACT II,She'ld have her hands on her hips and her tongue jumping
7057,ACT II,"As nimble as a stoat, delighting round"
7058,ACT II,The way the world's to be terrible and tormented.--
7059,ACT II,"Ay, but I'll have a thing to tell her now"
7060,ACT II,When she begins to ask the news! I'll say
7061,ACT II,"'You've misst such a show as never was nor will be,"
7062,ACT II,A roaring great affair of death and ruin;
7063,ACT II,And I was there--the world smasht to sparkles!'
7064,ACT II,"O, I can see her vext at that!"
7065,ACT II,
7066,ACT II,
7067,ACT II,"[MERRICK has been sunk in thought during this, but VINE seems to"
7068,ACT II,"brighten at his notion, and speaks quite cheerfully to HUFF, who now"
7069,ACT II,"comes in, looking mopish, and sits down.]"
7070,ACT II,
7071,ACT II,
7072,ACT II,Vine:
7073,ACT II,
7074,ACT II,"We've all been envying you, Huff. You're well off,"
7075,ACT II,You with your goodness and your enemies
7076,ACT II,Showing you how to relish it with their terror.
7077,ACT II,When do you mean the gibing is to start?
7078,ACT II,
7079,ACT II,
7080,ACT II,Huff:
7081,ACT II,
7082,ACT II,There's time enough.
7083,ACT II,
7084,ACT II,
7085,ACT II,Vine:
7086,ACT II,
7087,ACT II,"O, do they still hold out?"
7088,ACT II,If they should be for spiting you to the last!
7089,ACT II,You'ld best keep on at them: think out a list
7090,ACT II,"Of frantic things for them to do, when air"
7091,ACT II,Is scorching smother and the sin they did
7092,ACT II,"Frightens their hearts. You'll shout them into fear,"
7093,ACT II,"I undertake, if you find breath enough."
7094,ACT II,
7095,ACT II,
7096,ACT II,Huff:
7097,ACT II,
7098,ACT II,You have the breath. What's all your pester for?
7099,ACT II,You leave me be.
7100,ACT II,
7101,ACT II,
7102,ACT II,Vine:
7103,ACT II,
7104,ACT II,"Why, you're to do for me"
7105,ACT II,What I can't do myself.--And yet it's hard
7106,ACT II,To make out where Shale hurt you. What's the sum
7107,ACT II,Of all he did to you? Got you quit of marriage
7108,ACT II,Without the upset of a funeral.
7109,ACT II,
7110,ACT II,
7111,ACT II,Huff:
7112,ACT II,
7113,ACT II,Why need you blurt your rambling mind at me?
7114,ACT II,"Let me bide quiet in my thought awhile,"
7115,ACT II,And it's a little while we have for thought.
7116,ACT II,
7117,ACT II,
7118,ACT II,Merrick:
7119,ACT II,
7120,ACT II,"I know your thought. Paddling round and around,"
7121,ACT II,Like a squirrel working in a spinning cage
7122,ACT II,"With his neck stretcht to have his chin poke up,"
7123,ACT II,And silly feet busy and always going;
7124,ACT II,"Paddling round the story of your good life,"
7125,ACT II,"Your small good life, and how the decent men"
7126,ACT II,Have jeered at your wry antic.
7127,ACT II,
7128,ACT II,
7129,ACT II,Huff:
7130,ACT II,
7131,ACT II,My good life!
7132,ACT II,And what good has my goodness been to me?
7133,ACT II,You show me that! Somebody show me that!
7134,ACT II,"A caterpillar munching a cabbage-heart,"
7135,ACT II,Always drudging further and further from
7136,ACT II,"The sounds and lights of the world, never abroad"
7137,ACT II,Nor flying free in warmth and air sweet-smelling:
7138,ACT II,"A crawling caterpillar, eating his life"
7139,ACT II,In a deaf dark--that's my gain of goodness!
7140,ACT II,And it's too late to hatch out now!--
7141,ACT II,I can but fancy what I might have been;
7142,ACT II,I scarce know how to sin!--But I believe
7143,ACT II,A long while back I did come near to it.
7144,ACT II,
7145,ACT II,
7146,ACT II,Merrick:
7147,ACT II,
7148,ACT II,Well done!--O but I should have guesst all this!
7149,ACT II,
7150,ACT II,
7151,ACT II,Huff:
7152,ACT II,
7153,ACT II,I was in Droitwich; and the sight of the place
7154,ACT II,"Is where they cook the brine: a long dark shed,"
7155,ACT II,"Hot as an oven, full of a grey steam"
7156,ACT II,And ruddy light that leaks out of the furnace;
7157,ACT II,"And stirring the troughs, ladling the brine that boils"
7158,ACT II,"As thick as treacle, a double standing row,"
7159,ACT II,Women--boldly talking in wicked jokes
7160,ACT II,All day long. I went to see 'em. It was
7161,ACT II,A wonderful rousing sight. Not one of them
7162,ACT II,Was really wearing clothes: half of a sack
7163,ACT II,"Pinned in an apron was enough for most,"
7164,ACT II,And here and there might be a petticoat;
7165,ACT II,But nothing in the way of bodices.--
7166,ACT II,"O, they knew words to shame a carter's face!"
7167,ACT II,
7168,ACT II,
7169,ACT II,Merrick:
7170,ACT II,
7171,ACT II,This is the thought you would be quiet in!
7172,ACT II,
7173,ACT II,
7174,ACT II,Huff:
7175,ACT II,
7176,ACT II,Where else can I be quiet? Now there's an end
7177,ACT II,"Of daring, 'tis the one place my life has made"
7178,ACT II,"Where I may try to dare in thought. I mind,"
7179,ACT II,"When I stood in the midst of those bare women,"
7180,ACT II,"All at once, outburst with a rising buzz,"
7181,ACT II,A mob of flying thoughts was wild in me:
7182,ACT II,"Things I might do swarmed in my brain pell-mell,"
7183,ACT II,Like a heap of flies kickt into humming cloud.
7184,ACT II,I beat them down; and now I cannot tell
7185,ACT II,For certain what they were. I can call up
7186,ACT II,Naught venturesome and darting like their style;
7187,ACT II,Very tame braveries now!--O Shale's the man
7188,ACT II,To smile upon the End of the World; 'tis Shale
7189,ACT II,"Has lived the bold stiff fashion, and filled himself"
7190,ACT II,With thinking pride in what a man may do.--
7191,ACT II,I wish I had seen those women more than once!
7192,ACT II,
7193,ACT II,
7194,ACT II,Vine:
7195,ACT II,
7196,ACT II,"Well, here's an upside down! This is old Huff!"
7197,ACT II,What have you been in your heart all these years?
7198,ACT II,The man you were or the new man you are?
7199,ACT II,
7200,ACT II,
7201,ACT II,Huff:
7202,ACT II,
7203,ACT II,Just a dead flesh!
7204,ACT II,
7205,ACT II,
7206,ACT II,Merrick:
7207,ACT II,
7208,ACT II,"Nay, Huff the good man at least"
7209,ACT II,"Was something alive, though snarling like trapt vermin."
7210,ACT II,But this? What's this for the figure of a man?
7211,ACT II,'Tis a boy's smutty picture on a wall.
7212,ACT II,
7213,ACT II,
7214,ACT II,Huff:
7215,ACT II,
7216,ACT II,"I was alive, was I? Like a blind bird"
7217,ACT II,"That flies and cannot see the flight it takes,"
7218,ACT II,Feeling it with mere rowing of its wings.
7219,ACT II,But Shale--he's had a stirring sense of what he is.
7220,ACT II,
7221,ACT II,
7222,ACT II,"[Shouting outside. Then SOLLERS walks in again, very quiet and steady."
7223,ACT II,"He stands in the middle, looking down on the floor.]"
7224,ACT II,
7225,ACT II,
7226,ACT II,Vine:
7227,ACT II,
7228,ACT II,What do they holla for there?
7229,ACT II,
7230,ACT II,
7231,ACT II,Sollers:
7232,ACT II,
7233,ACT II,The earth.
7234,ACT II,
7235,ACT II,
7236,ACT II,Merrick:
7237,ACT II,
7238,ACT II,The earth?
7239,ACT II,
7240,ACT II,
7241,ACT II,Sollers:
7242,ACT II,
7243,ACT II,The earth's afire.
7244,ACT II,
7245,ACT II,
7246,ACT II,Huff:
7247,ACT II,
7248,ACT II,The earth blazing already?
7249,ACT II,
7250,ACT II,
7251,ACT II,[Shouts again.]
7252,ACT II,
7253,ACT II,
7254,ACT II,"O, not so soon as this?"
7255,ACT II,
7256,ACT II,
7257,ACT II,Vine:
7258,ACT II,
7259,ACT II,What sort of a fire?
7260,ACT II,
7261,ACT II,
7262,ACT II,Sollers:
7263,ACT II,
7264,ACT II,"The earth has caught the heat of the star, you fool."
7265,ACT II,
7266,ACT II,
7267,ACT II,Merrick:
7268,ACT II,
7269,ACT II,I know: there's come some dazzle in your eyes
7270,ACT II,From facing to the star; a lamp would do it.
7271,ACT II,
7272,ACT II,
7273,ACT II,Huff:
7274,ACT II,
7275,ACT II,"It will be that. Your sight, being so strained,"
7276,ACT II,Is flashing of itself.
7277,ACT II,
7278,ACT II,
7279,ACT II,Sollers:
7280,ACT II,
7281,ACT II,Say what you like.
7282,ACT II,There's a red flare out of the land beyond
7283,ACT II,Looking over the hills into our valley.
7284,ACT II,"The thing's begun, 'tis certain. Go and see."
7285,ACT II,
7286,ACT II,
7287,ACT II,Vine:
7288,ACT II,
7289,ACT II,I won't see that. I will stay here.
7290,ACT II,
7291,ACT II,
7292,ACT II,Sollers:
7293,ACT II,
7294,ACT II,"Ay, creep"
7295,ACT II,Into your oven. You'll be cooler there.--
7296,ACT II,"O my God, we'll all be coals in an hour!"
7297,ACT II,
7298,ACT II,
7299,ACT II,[Shouts again.]
7300,ACT II,
7301,ACT II,
7302,ACT II,Huff:
7303,ACT II,
7304,ACT II,"And I have naught to stand in my heart upright,"
7305,ACT II,And vow it made my living time worth more
7306,ACT II,Than if my time had been death in a grave!
7307,ACT II,
7308,ACT II,
7309,ACT II,[Several persons run in.]
7310,ACT II,
7311,ACT II,
7312,ACT II,The Crowd:
7313,ACT II,
7314,ACT II,1. The river's the place!
7315,ACT II,2.                       The only safe place now!
7316,ACT II,3. Best all charge down to the river!
7317,ACT II,"4.                             For there's a blaze,"
7318,ACT II,A travelling blaze comes racing along the earth.
7319,ACT II,
7320,ACT II,
7321,ACT II,Sollers:
7322,ACT II,
7323,ACT II,'Tis true. The air's red-hot above the hills.
7324,ACT II,
7325,ACT II,
7326,ACT II,The Crowd:
7327,ACT II,
7328,ACT II,"1. Ay, but the burning now crests the hill-tops"
7329,ACT II,In quiver of yellow flame.
7330,ACT II,2.                        And a great smoke
7331,ACT II,Waving and tumbling upward.
7332,ACT II,3.                             The river now!
7333,ACT II,"4. The only place we have, not to be roasted!"
7334,ACT II,
7335,ACT II,
7336,ACT II,Merrick:
7337,ACT II,
7338,ACT II,"And what will make us water-rats or otters,"
7339,ACT II,To keep our breath still living through a dive
7340,ACT II,That lasts until the earth's burnt out? Or how
7341,ACT II,"Would that trick serve, when we stand up to gasp,"
7342,ACT II,And find the star waiting for our plunged heads
7343,ACT II,To knock them into pummy?
7344,ACT II,
7345,ACT II,
7346,ACT II,Vine:
7347,ACT II,
7348,ACT II,Scarce more dazed
7349,ACT II,"I'ld be with that than now. I shall be bound,"
7350,ACT II,"When I'm to give my wife the tale of it all,"
7351,ACT II,To be devising: more of this to-do
7352,ACT II,My mind won't carry.
7353,ACT II,
7354,ACT II,
7355,ACT II,Huff:
7356,ACT II,
7357,ACT II,"O ashamed I am,"
7358,ACT II,"Ashamed!--It needn't have been downright feats,"
7359,ACT II,"Such as the braving men, the like of Shale,"
7360,ACT II,"Do easily, and smile, keeping them up."
7361,ACT II,If I could look back to one manful hour
7362,ACT II,Of romping in the face of all my goodness!--
7363,ACT II,
7364,ACT II,
7365,ACT II,"[SHALE comes in, dragging Mrs HUFF by the hand.]"
7366,ACT II,
7367,ACT II,
7368,ACT II,Shale:
7369,ACT II,
7370,ACT II,"Huff! Where's Huff?--Huff, you must take her back!"
7371,ACT II,You'll take her back? She's yours: I give her up.
7372,ACT II,
7373,ACT II,
7374,ACT II,Merrick:
7375,ACT II,
7376,ACT II,Belike here's something bold again.
7377,ACT II,
7378,ACT II,
7379,ACT II,Mrs Huff (to SHALE):
7380,ACT II,
7381,ACT II,"Once more,"
7382,ACT II,Listen.
7383,ACT II,
7384,ACT II,
7385,ACT II,Shale:
7386,ACT II,
7387,ACT II,I will not listen. There's no time
7388,ACT II,For aught but giving you back where you belong;
7389,ACT II,"And that's with you, Huff. Take her."
7390,ACT II,
7391,ACT II,
7392,ACT II,Huff:
7393,ACT II,
7394,ACT II,Here is depth
7395,ACT II,I cannot see to. Is it your last fling?--
7396,ACT II,The dolt I am in these things!--What's this way
7397,ACT II,You've found of living wickedly to the end?
7398,ACT II,
7399,ACT II,
7400,ACT II,Shale:
7401,ACT II,
7402,ACT II,"Scorn as you please, but take her back, man, take her."
7403,ACT II,
7404,ACT II,
7405,ACT II,Huff:
7406,ACT II,
7407,ACT II,But she's my wife! Take her back now? What for?
7408,ACT II,
7409,ACT II,
7410,ACT II,Mrs Huff:
7411,ACT II,
7412,ACT II,What for? Have you not known of thieves that throw
7413,ACT II,"Their robbery down, soon as they hear a step"
7414,ACT II,"Sounding behind them on the road, and run"
7415,ACT II,"A long way off, and pull an honest face?"
7416,ACT II,"Ay, see Shale's eyes practising baby-looks!"
7417,ACT II,"He never stole, not he!"
7418,ACT II,
7419,ACT II,
7420,ACT II,Shale:
7421,ACT II,
7422,ACT II,Don't hear her talk.
7423,ACT II,
7424,ACT II,
7425,ACT II,Mrs Huff:
7426,ACT II,
7427,ACT II,But he was a talker once! Love was the thing;
7428,ACT II,"And love, he swore, would make the wrong go right,"
7429,ACT II,And Huff was a kind of devil--and that's true----
7430,ACT II,
7431,ACT II,
7432,ACT II,Huff:
7433,ACT II,
7434,ACT II,What? I've been devilish and never knew?
7435,ACT II,
7436,ACT II,
7437,ACT II,Mrs Huff:
7438,ACT II,
7439,ACT II,The devil in the world that hates all love.
7440,ACT II,"But Shale said, he'd the love in him would hold"
7441,ACT II,If the world's frame and the fate of men were crackt.
7442,ACT II,
7443,ACT II,
7444,ACT II,Shale:
7445,ACT II,
7446,ACT II,What I said!
7447,ACT II,Whoever thought the world was going to crack?
7448,ACT II,
7449,ACT II,
7450,ACT II,Mrs Huff:
7451,ACT II,
7452,ACT II,And now he hears someone move behind him.--
7453,ACT II,"They'll say, perhaps, 'You stole this!'--Down it goes,"
7454,ACT II,Thrown to the dirty road--thrown to Huff!
7455,ACT II,
7456,ACT II,
7457,ACT II,Shale:
7458,ACT II,
7459,ACT II,"Yes, to the owner."
7460,ACT II,
7461,ACT II,
7462,ACT II,Mrs Huff:
7463,ACT II,
7464,ACT II,It was not such brave thieving.
7465,ACT II,"You did not take me from my owner, Shale:"
7466,ACT II,"There's an old robber will do that some day,"
7467,ACT II,Not you.
7468,ACT II,
7469,ACT II,
7470,ACT II,Vine:
7471,ACT II,
7472,ACT II,"Were you thinking of me then, missis?"
7473,ACT II,
7474,ACT II,
7475,ACT II,Mrs Huff (still to SHALE):
7476,ACT II,
7477,ACT II,You found me lost in the dirt: I was with Huff.
7478,ACT II,"You lifted me from there; and there again,"
7479,ACT II,"Like a frightened urchin, you're for throwing me."
7480,ACT II,
7481,ACT II,
7482,ACT II,Shale:
7483,ACT II,
7484,ACT II,Let it be that! I'm firm
7485,ACT II,"Not to have you about me, when the thing,"
7486,ACT II,"Whatever it is, that's standing now behind"
7487,ACT II,"The burning of the world, comes out on us."
7488,ACT II,
7489,ACT II,
7490,ACT II,Huff:
7491,ACT II,
7492,ACT II,The way men cheat! This windle-stalk was he
7493,ACT II,Would hold a show of spirit for the world
7494,ACT II,To study while it ruined!--Make what you please
7495,ACT II,"Of your short wrangle here, but leave me out."
7496,ACT II,I have my thoughts--O far enough from this.
7497,ACT II,
7498,ACT II,
7499,ACT II,[Turning away.]
7500,ACT II,
7501,ACT II,
7502,ACT II,Shale (seizing him):
7503,ACT II,
7504,ACT II,"You shall not put me off. I tell you, Huff,"
7505,ACT II,You are to take her back now.
7506,ACT II,
7507,ACT II,
7508,ACT II,Huff:
7509,ACT II,
7510,ACT II,Take her back!
7511,ACT II,And what has she to do with what I want?
7512,ACT II,
7513,ACT II,
7514,ACT II,Shale:
7515,ACT II,
7516,ACT II,Isn't she yours? I must be quit of her;
7517,ACT II,I'll not be in the risk of keeping her.
7518,ACT II,She's yours!
7519,ACT II,
7520,ACT II,
7521,ACT II,Huff:
7522,ACT II,
7523,ACT II,And what's the good of her now to me?
7524,ACT II,What's the good of a woman whom I've married?
7525,ACT II,
7526,ACT II,
7527,ACT II,"[During this, WARP the molecatcher has come in.]"
7528,ACT II,

7530,ACT II,Warp:
7531,ACT II,
7532,ACT II,Shale and Huff at their old pother again!
7533,ACT II,
7534,ACT II,
7535,ACT II,Merrick:
7536,ACT II,
7537,ACT II,The molecatcher.
7538,ACT II,
7539,ACT II,
7540,ACT II,Sollers:
7541,ACT II,
7542,ACT II,"Warp, have you travelled far?"
7543,ACT II,Is it through frenzy and ghastly crowds you've come?
7544,ACT II,
7545,ACT II,
7546,ACT II,Vine:
7547,ACT II,
7548,ACT II,"Have you got dreadful things to tell us, Warp?"
7549,ACT II,
7550,ACT II,
7551,ACT II,Warp:
7552,ACT II,
7553,ACT II,"Why, no."
7554,ACT II,"But seemingly you'ld have had news for me,"
7555,ACT II,"If I'd come later. Is Huff to murder Shale,"
7556,ACT II,"Or Shale for murdering Huff? One way or 'tother,"
7557,ACT II,"'Tis time 'twas settled surely.--Mrs Huff,"
7558,ACT II,They're neither of them worth you: here's your health.

7562,ACT II,
7563,ACT II,
7564,ACT II,Huff:

7566,ACT II,Where have you been? Are you not new from folk
7567,ACT II,That throng together in a pelting horror?
7568,ACT II,
7569,ACT II,
7570,ACT II,Warp:
7571,ACT II,
7572,ACT II,Do you think the whole land hearkens to the flurry
7573,ACT II,Of an old dog biting at a young dog's throat?
7574,ACT II,
7575,ACT II,
7576,ACT II,Merrick:
7577,ACT II,
7578,ACT II,"No, no! Not their shrill yapping; you've not heard"
7579,ACT II,The world's near to be blasted?
7580,ACT II,

7582,ACT II,Warp:
7583,ACT II,
7584,ACT II,No mutter of it.
7585,ACT II,"I am from walking the whole ground I trap,"
7586,ACT II,"And there's no likeness of it, but the moles"
7587,ACT II,I've turned up dead and dried out of three counties.

7590,ACT II,Sollers:
7591,ACT II,
7592,ACT II,"Why, but the fire that's eating the whole earth;"
7593,ACT II,The breath of it is scarlet in the sky!
7594,ACT II,You must have seen that?
7595,ACT II,
7596,ACT II,
7597,ACT II,Warp:
7598,ACT II,
7599,ACT II,But what's taken you?
7600,ACT II,"You are like boys that go to hunt for ghosts,"
7601,ACT II,And turn the scuttle of rats to a roused demon
7602,ACT II,Crawling to shut the door of the barn they search.
7603,ACT II,"Fire? Yes, fire is playing a pretty game"
7604,ACT II,"Yonder, and has its golden fun to itself,"
7605,ACT II,Seemingly.
7606,ACT II,
7607,ACT II,
7608,ACT II,Sollers:

7613,ACT II,Warp:
7614,ACT II,
7615,ACT II,Call me a mole and not a molecatcher
7616,ACT II,If I do not. It is a rick that burns;
7617,ACT II,And a strange thing I'll count it if the rick
7618,ACT II,Be not old Huff's.
7619,ACT II,
7620,ACT II,

7646,ACT II,"Yes, as you're so clever,"
7647,ACT II,You can talk down maybe yon brandishing star!

7653,ACT II,The tail swings long enough to-night for that.
7654,ACT II,"Well, look your best at it; 'tis off again"
7655,ACT II,"To go its rounds, they tell me, from now on;"
7656,ACT II,"And the next time it swaggers in our sky,"
7657,ACT II,The moles a long while will have tired themselves
7658,ACT II,Of having their easy joke with me.

7703,ACT II,The noise you made was like that! But I knew
7704,ACT II,"You'ld laugh at me, so sure you were the world"
7705,ACT II,Would shiver like a bursting grindlestone:
7706,ACT II,"Else I'ld have said out loud, 'twas a fool's whimsy."
7707,ACT II,
7708,ACT II,
7709,ACT II,Vine:
7710,ACT II,
7711,ACT II,Where are you now? What am I now to think?
7712,ACT II,"Your minds run round in puzzles, like chased hares."
7713,ACT II,I cannot sight them.
7714,ACT II,
7715,ACT II,
7716,ACT II,Merrick:
7717,ACT II,
7718,ACT II,Think of going to bed.
7719,ACT II,
7720,ACT II,
7721,ACT II,Sollers:
7722,ACT II,
7723,ACT II,And dreaming prices for your pigs.
7724,ACT II,
7725,ACT II,
7726,ACT II,Merrick:
7727,ACT II,
7728,ACT II,"O Warp,"
7729,ACT II,"You should have seen Vine crying! The moon, he said,"
7730,ACT II,The silver moon! Just like an onion 'twas
7731,ACT II,To stir the water in his eyes.
7732,ACT II,
7733,ACT II,
7734,ACT II,Sollers:
7735,ACT II,
7736,ACT II,He's left
7737,ACT II,A puddle of his tears where he was droopt
7738,ACT II,Over the table.
7739,ACT II,
7740,ACT II,
7741,ACT II,Vine:
7742,ACT II,
7743,ACT II,There's to be no ruin?--
7744,ACT II,"But what's the word of a molecatcher, to crow"
7745,ACT II,So ringing over a dowser's word?
7746,ACT II,
7747,ACT II,
7748,ACT II,Warp:
7749,ACT II,
7750,ACT II,I'll tell you.
7751,ACT II,These dowsers live on lies: my trade's the truth.
7752,ACT II,"I can read moles, and the way they've dug their journeys,"
7753,ACT II,Where you'ld not see a wrinkle.
7754,ACT II,
7755,ACT II,
7756,ACT II,Vine:
7757,ACT II,
7758,ACT II,And he knows
7759,ACT II,The buried water.
7760,ACT II,
7761,ACT II,
7762,ACT II,Warp:
7763,ACT II,
7764,ACT II,"There's always buried water,"
7765,ACT II,If you prod deep enough. A dowser finds
7766,ACT II,"Because the whole earth's floating, like a raft."
7767,ACT II,What does he know? A twitching in his thews;
7768,ACT II,A dog asleep knows that much. What I know
7769,ACT II,"I've learnt, and if I'd learnt it wrong, I'ld starve."
7770,ACT II,"And if I'm right about the grubbing moles,"
7771,ACT II,Won't I be right for news of walking men?
7772,ACT II,
7773,ACT II,
7774,ACT II,Merrick:
7775,ACT II,
7776,ACT II,"Of course you're right. Let's put the whole thing by,"
7777,ACT II,And have a pleasant drink.
7778,ACT II,
7779,ACT II,
7780,ACT II,Shale (to Mrs HUFF):
7781,ACT II,
7782,ACT II,You must be tired
7783,ACT II,With all this story. Shall we be off for home?
7784,ACT II,
7785,ACT II,
7786,ACT II,Huff:
7787,ACT II,
7788,ACT II,You brass! You don't go now with her! She's mine:
7789,ACT II,You gave her up.
7790,ACT II,
7791,ACT II,
7792,ACT II,Shale:
7793,ACT II,
7794,ACT II,And you made nothing of her.
7795,ACT II,
7796,ACT II,(To Mrs Huff)
7797,ACT II,
7798,ACT II,Come on.
7799,ACT II,
7800,ACT II,
7801,ACT II,Mrs Huff:
7802,ACT II,
7803,ACT II,"Warp, will you do a thing for me?"
7804,ACT II,
7805,ACT II,
7806,ACT II,Warp:
7807,ACT II,
7808,ACT II,A hundred things.
7809,ACT II,
7810,ACT II,
7811,ACT II,Mrs Huff:
7812,ACT II,
7813,ACT II,Then slap me these cur-dogs.
7814,ACT II,
7815,ACT II,
7816,ACT II,Warp:
7817,ACT II,
7818,ACT II,"I will. Where will I slap them, and which first?"
7819,ACT II,
7820,ACT II,
7821,ACT II,Mrs Huff:
7822,ACT II,
7823,ACT II,Maybe 'twill do if you but laugh at them.
7824,ACT II,
7825,ACT II,
7826,ACT II,Warp:
7827,ACT II,
7828,ACT II,I'll try for that; but they are not good jokes;
7829,ACT II,Though there's a kind of monkey-look about them.
7830,ACT II,
7831,ACT II,
7832,ACT II,Mrs Huff:
7833,ACT II,
7834,ACT II,They thinking I'ld be near one or the other
7835,ACT II,After this night! Will I be made no more
7836,ACT II,"Than clay that children puddle to their minds,"
7837,ACT II,Moulding it what they fancy?--Shale was brave:
7838,ACT II,"He made a bogy and defied it, till"
7839,ACT II,He frightened of his work and ran away.
7840,ACT II,But Huff!--Huff was for modelling wickedly.
7841,ACT II,
7842,ACT II,
7843,ACT II,Huff:
7844,ACT II,
7845,ACT II,Who told you that?
7846,ACT II,
7847,ACT II,
7848,ACT II,Mrs Huff:
7849,ACT II,
7850,ACT II,I need no one's telling.
7851,ACT II,I was your wife once. Don't I know your goodness?
7852,ACT II,"A stupid heart gone sour with jealousy,"
7853,ACT II,To feel its blood too dull and thick for sinning.--
7854,ACT II,"Yes, Huff would figure a wicked thought, but had"
7855,ACT II,"No notion how, and flung the clay aside.--"
7856,ACT II,O they were gaudy colours both! But now
7857,ACT II,"Fear has bleacht their swagger and left them blank,"
7858,ACT II,"Fear of a loon that cried, End of the World!"
7859,ACT II,
7860,ACT II,
7861,ACT II,Huff:
7862,ACT II,
7863,ACT II,"Shale, do you know what we're to do?"
7864,ACT II,
7865,ACT II,
7866,ACT II,Shale:
7867,ACT II,
7868,ACT II,I'ld like
7869,ACT II,To have the handling of that dowser-man.
7870,ACT II,
7871,ACT II,
7872,ACT II,Huff:
7873,ACT II,
7874,ACT II,"Just that, my lad, just that!"
7875,ACT II,
7876,ACT II,
7877,ACT II,Warp:
7878,ACT II,
7879,ACT II,And your fired rick.
7880,ACT II,
7881,ACT II,
7882,ACT II,Huff:
7883,ACT II,
7884,ACT II,"Let it be blazes! Quick, Shale, after him!"
7885,ACT II,"I'll tramp the night out, but I'll take the rogue."
7886,ACT II,
7887,ACT II,
7888,ACT II,Shale (to the others):
7889,ACT II,
7890,ACT II,"You wait, and see us haul him by the ears,"
7891,ACT II,And swim the blatherer in Huff's farm-yard pond.
7892,ACT II,
7893,ACT II,
7894,ACT II,"[As HUFF and SHALE go out, they see the comet before them.]"
7895,ACT II,
7896,ACT II,
7897,ACT II,Huff:
7898,ACT II,
7899,ACT II,The devil's own star is that!
7900,ACT II,
7901,ACT II,
7902,ACT II,Shale:
7903,ACT II,
7904,ACT II,And floats as calm
7905,ACT II,As a pike basking.
7906,ACT II,
7907,ACT II,
7908,ACT II,Huff:
7909,ACT II,
7910,ACT II,There shouldn't be such stars!
7911,ACT II,
7912,ACT II,
7913,ACT II,Shale:
7914,ACT II,
7915,ACT II,"Neither such dowsers, and we'll learn him that."
7916,ACT II,
7917,ACT II,
7918,ACT II,[They go off together.]
7919,ACT II,
7920,ACT II,
7921,ACT II,Sollers:
7922,ACT II,
7923,ACT II,"Why, the star's dwindling now, surely!"
7924,ACT II,
7925,ACT II,
7926,ACT II,Merrick:
7927,ACT II,
7928,ACT II,"O, small"
7929,ACT II,And dull now to the glowing size it was.
7930,ACT II,
7931,ACT II,
7932,ACT II,Vine:
7933,ACT II,
7934,ACT II,But is it certain there'll be nothing smasht?
7935,ACT II,Not even a house knockt roaring down in crumbles?
7936,ACT II,"--And I did think, I'ld open my wife's mouth"
7937,ACT II,With envy of the dreadful things I'd seen!
