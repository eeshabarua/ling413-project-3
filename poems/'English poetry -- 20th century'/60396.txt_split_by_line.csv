110,A RECOLLECTION,My father's friend came once to tea.
111,A RECOLLECTION,He laughed and talked. He spoke to me.
112,A RECOLLECTION,But in another week they said
113,A RECOLLECTION,That friendly pink-faced man was dead.

115,A RECOLLECTION,"""How sad . ."" they said, ""the best of men . ."""
116,A RECOLLECTION,"So I said too, ""How sad""; but then"

145,A CHILD'S DREAM,[Illustration: Boy and dog]
146,A CHILD'S DREAM,
147,A CHILD'S DREAM,"I had a little dog, and my dog was very small;"
148,A CHILD'S DREAM,"He licked me in the face, and he answered to my call;"
149,A CHILD'S DREAM,"Of all the treasures that were mine, I loved him most of all."
150,A CHILD'S DREAM,
151,A CHILD'S DREAM,His nose was fresh as morning dew and blacker than the night;
152,A CHILD'S DREAM,I thought that it could even snuff the shadows and the light;
153,A CHILD'S DREAM,"And his tail he held it bravely, like a banner in a fight."
154,A CHILD'S DREAM,
155,A CHILD'S DREAM,His body covered thick with hair was very good to smell;
156,A CHILD'S DREAM,His little stomach underneath was pink as any shell;
157,A CHILD'S DREAM,"And I loved him and honoured him, more than words can tell."
158,A CHILD'S DREAM,
159,A CHILD'S DREAM,"We ran out in the morning, both of us, to play,"
160,A CHILD'S DREAM,Up and down across the fields for all the sunny day;
161,A CHILD'S DREAM,But he ran so swiftly--he ran right away.
162,A CHILD'S DREAM,
163,A CHILD'S DREAM,"I looked for him, I called for him, entreatingly. Alas,"
164,A CHILD'S DREAM,"The dandelions could not speak, though they had seen him pass,"
165,A CHILD'S DREAM,And nowhere was his waving tail among the waving grass.
166,A CHILD'S DREAM,
167,A CHILD'S DREAM,I called him in a thousand ways and yet he did not come;
168,A CHILD'S DREAM,The pathways and the hedges were horrible and dumb.
169,A CHILD'S DREAM,I prayed to God who never heard. My desperate soul grew numb.
170,A CHILD'S DREAM,
171,A CHILD'S DREAM,"The sun sank low. I ran; I prayed: ""If God has not the power"
172,A CHILD'S DREAM,"To find him, let me die. I cannot bear another hour."""
173,A CHILD'S DREAM,When suddenly I came upon a great yellow flower.
174,A CHILD'S DREAM,
175,A CHILD'S DREAM,"And all among its petals, such was Heaven's grace,"
176,A CHILD'S DREAM,"In that golden hour, in that golden place,"
177,A CHILD'S DREAM,"All among its petals, was his hairy face."

183,TO A FAT LADY SEEN FROM THE TRAIN,
184,TO A FAT LADY SEEN FROM THE TRAIN,"O why do you walk through the fields in gloves,"
185,TO A FAT LADY SEEN FROM THE TRAIN,Missing so much and so much?
186,TO A FAT LADY SEEN FROM THE TRAIN,"O fat white woman whom nobody loves,"
187,TO A FAT LADY SEEN FROM THE TRAIN,"Why do you walk through the fields in gloves,"
188,TO A FAT LADY SEEN FROM THE TRAIN,When the grass is soft as the breast of doves
189,TO A FAT LADY SEEN FROM THE TRAIN,And shivering sweet to the touch?

199,A WASTED DAY,"Hotly, in haste,"
200,A WASTED DAY,All the calm hours
201,A WASTED DAY,I gashed and defaced.
202,A WASTED DAY,
203,A WASTED DAY,"Let me forget,"
204,A WASTED DAY,Let me embark
205,A WASTED DAY,--Sleep for my boat--
206,A WASTED DAY,And sail through the dark.
207,A WASTED DAY,
208,A WASTED DAY,Till a new day
209,A WASTED DAY,"Heaven shall send,"

224,IN FRANCE,
225,IN FRANCE,The girl who in their shadow sits

229,IN FRANCE,
230,IN FRANCE,The leisurely contented cows
231,IN FRANCE,Can only see the earth they browse;
232,IN FRANCE,Their piebald bodies through the grass
233,IN FRANCE,"With busy, munching noses pass."
234,IN FRANCE,
235,IN FRANCE,Alone the sun and I behold

245,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,"I am a Witch, and a kind old Witch,"
246,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,There's many a one knows that--
247,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,Alone I live in my little dark house
248,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,"With Pillycock, my cat."
249,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,
250,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,"A girl came running through the night,"
251,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,When all the winds blew free:--
252,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,"""O mother, change a young man's heart"
253,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,That will not look on me.
254,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,
255,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,"O mother, brew a magic mead"
256,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,"To stir his heart so cold."""
257,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,"""Just as you will, my dear,"" said I,"
258,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,"""And I thank you for your gold."""
259,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,
260,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,So here am I in the wattled copse
261,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,"Where all the twigs are brown,"
262,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,To find what I need to brew my mead
263,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,As the dark of night comes down.
264,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,
265,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,"Primroses in my old hands,"
266,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,"Sweet to smell and young,"

268,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,Wherever the larks have sung.
269,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,
270,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,With celandines as heavenly crowns

273,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,Shall bring her Love's delight.
274,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,
275,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,But orchids growing snakey green
276,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,"Speckled dark with blood,"
277,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,And fallen leaves that curled and shrank
278,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,"And rotted in the mud,"
279,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,
280,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,With blistering nettles burning harsh
281,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,And blinding thorns above;
282,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,"All of these, O all of these"
283,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,Shall bring the pains of Love.
284,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,
285,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,"Shall bring the pains of Love, my Puss,"

288,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,Till it bleeds the heart away.
289,THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE,

301,IN DORSET,
302,IN DORSET,From muddy road to muddy lane
303,IN DORSET,I plodded through the falling rain;
304,IN DORSET,For miles and miles was nothing there
305,IN DORSET,"But mist, and mud, and hedges bare."
306,IN DORSET,
307,IN DORSET,At length approaching I espied
308,IN DORSET,Two gipsy women side by side;
309,IN DORSET,They turned their faces broad and bold
310,IN DORSET,"And brown and freshened by the cold,"
311,IN DORSET,And stared at me in gipsy wise
312,IN DORSET,"With shrewd, unfriendly, savage eyes."
313,IN DORSET,
314,IN DORSET,"No word they said, no more dared I;"
315,IN DORSET,And so we passed each other by--
316,IN DORSET,The only living things that met
317,IN DORSET,In all those miles of mist and wet.

327,THE WATCH,My little watch was ticking clear.
328,THE WATCH,I thought the throbbing of it went
329,THE WATCH,Like my continual discontent;
330,THE WATCH,I thought it said in every tick:
331,THE WATCH,"I am so sick, so sick, so sick;"

348,PEOPLE,"Gilt pavilions in a row,"
349,PEOPLE,Stucco houses built for show.
350,PEOPLE,
351,PEOPLE,But our eyes can never reach
352,PEOPLE,"Further than the foolish beach,"
353,PEOPLE,Never can they hope to win
354,PEOPLE,To the fastnesses within:
355,PEOPLE,Rocks unsealed that watch the sky
356,PEOPLE,And the tormented clouds go by;--
357,PEOPLE,Darkest forests full of gleams

426,AUTUMN MORNING AT CAMBRIDGE,"I ran out in the morning, when the air was clean and new,"
427,AUTUMN MORNING AT CAMBRIDGE,"And all the grass was glittering, and grey with autumn dew,"
428,AUTUMN MORNING AT CAMBRIDGE,"I ran out to the apple tree and pulled an apple down,"
429,AUTUMN MORNING AT CAMBRIDGE,And all the bells were ringing in the old grey town.
430,AUTUMN MORNING AT CAMBRIDGE,
431,AUTUMN MORNING AT CAMBRIDGE,"Down in the town, off the bridges and the grass"
432,AUTUMN MORNING AT CAMBRIDGE,"They are sweeping up the leaves to let the people pass,"
433,AUTUMN MORNING AT CAMBRIDGE,"Sweeping up the old leaves, golden-reds and browns,"
434,AUTUMN MORNING AT CAMBRIDGE,While the men go to lecture with the wind in their gowns.

441,AUTUMN EVENING,"The shadows flickering, the daylight dying,"
442,AUTUMN EVENING,"And I upon the old red sofa lying,"
443,AUTUMN EVENING,"The great brown shadows leaping up the wall,"
444,AUTUMN EVENING,The sparrows twittering; and that is all.
445,AUTUMN EVENING,
446,AUTUMN EVENING,"I thought to send my soul to far-off lands,"
447,AUTUMN EVENING,"Where fairies scamper on the windy sands,"
448,AUTUMN EVENING,Or where the autumn rain comes drumming down
449,AUTUMN EVENING,On huddled roofs in an enchanted town.
450,AUTUMN EVENING,
451,AUTUMN EVENING,"But O my sleepy soul, it will not roam,"
452,AUTUMN EVENING,It is too happy and too warm at home:
453,AUTUMN EVENING,"With just the shadows leaping up the wall,"
454,AUTUMN EVENING,The sparrows twittering; and that is all.
