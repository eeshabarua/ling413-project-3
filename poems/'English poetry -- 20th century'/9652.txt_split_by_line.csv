45,PREFATORY NOTE,"This 'Miscellany of Poetry, 1919', is issued to the public as a truly"
46,PREFATORY NOTE,catholic anthology of contemporary poetry. The poems here printed are
47,PREFATORY NOTE,"new, in the sense that they have not previously been issued by their"
48,PREFATORY NOTE,authors in book form--a fact which surely gives the Miscellany an unique
49,PREFATORY NOTE,place among modern collections. My deep thanks are due to my
50,PREFATORY NOTE,"fellow-contributors for their generous and hearty co-operation, and to"
51,PREFATORY NOTE,"the editors of the 'English Review', 'To-day', 'Voices', 'New Witness',"
52,PREFATORY NOTE,"'Observer', 'Saturday Westminster', 'Art and Letters', 'Cambridge"
53,PREFATORY NOTE,Magazine' and the 'Nation' for permission to reprint certain poems.

326,NUMBERS,NUMBERS
327,NUMBERS,
328,NUMBERS,Trefoil and Quatrefoil!
329,NUMBERS,What shaped those destinied small silent leaves
330,NUMBERS,Or numbered them under the soil?
331,NUMBERS,I lift my dazzled sight
332,NUMBERS,"From grass to sky,"
333,NUMBERS,From humming and hot perfume
334,NUMBERS,"To scorching, quivering light,"
335,NUMBERS,"Empty blue!--Why,"
336,NUMBERS,As I bury my face afresh
337,NUMBERS,In a sunshot vivid gloom--
338,NUMBERS,"Minute infinity's mesh,"
339,NUMBERS,Where spearing side by side
340,NUMBERS,Smooth stalk and furred uplift
341,NUMBERS,"Their luminous green secrets from the grass,"
342,NUMBERS,Tower to a bud and delicately divide--
343,NUMBERS,Do I think of the things unthought
344,NUMBERS,Before man was?
345,NUMBERS,
346,NUMBERS,Bodiless Numbers!
347,NUMBERS,When there was none to explore
348,NUMBERS,"Your winding labyrinths occult,"
349,NUMBERS,None to delve your ore
350,NUMBERS,"Of strange virtue, or do"
351,NUMBERS,"Your magical business, you"
352,NUMBERS,"Were there, never old nor new,"
353,NUMBERS,Veined in the world and alive:--
354,NUMBERS,"Before the Planets, Seven;"
355,NUMBERS,"Before these fingers, Five!"
356,NUMBERS,
357,NUMBERS,"You that are globed and single,"
358,NUMBERS,"Crystal virgins, and you that part,"
359,NUMBERS,"Melt, and again mingle!"
360,NUMBERS,We have hoisted sail in the night
361,NUMBERS,On the oceans that you chart:
362,NUMBERS,"Dark winds carry us onward, on;"
363,NUMBERS,"But you are there before us, silent Answers,"
364,NUMBERS,Beyond the bounds of the sun.
365,NUMBERS,"You body yourselves in the stars, inscrutable dancers,"
366,NUMBERS,Native where we are none.
367,NUMBERS,
368,NUMBERS,O inhuman Numbers!
369,NUMBERS,"All things change and glide,"
370,NUMBERS,"Corrupt and crumble, suffer wreck and decay,"
371,NUMBERS,"But, obstinate dark Integrities, you abide,"
372,NUMBERS,And obey but them who obey.
373,NUMBERS,All things else are dyed
374,NUMBERS,In the colours of man's desire:
375,NUMBERS,But you no bribe nor prayer
376,NUMBERS,Avails to soften or sway.
377,NUMBERS,"Nothing of me you share,"
378,NUMBERS,Yet I cannot think you away.
379,NUMBERS,"And if I seek to escape you, still you are there"
380,NUMBERS,Stronger than caging pillars of iron
381,NUMBERS,"Not to be passed, in an air"
382,NUMBERS,Where human wish and word
383,NUMBERS,Fall like a frozen bird.
384,NUMBERS,
385,NUMBERS,Music asleep
386,NUMBERS,"In pulses of sound, in the waves!"
387,NUMBERS,Hidden runes rubbed bright!
388,NUMBERS,Dizzy ladders of thought in the night!
389,NUMBERS,Are you masters or slaves--
390,NUMBERS,"Subtlest of man's slaves,--"
391,NUMBERS,Shadowy Numbers?
392,NUMBERS,
393,NUMBERS,In a vision I saw
394,NUMBERS,"Old vulture Time, feeding"
395,NUMBERS,On the flesh of the world; I saw
396,NUMBERS,The home of our use undated--
397,NUMBERS,Seasons of fruiting and seeding
398,NUMBERS,"Withered, and hunger and thirst"
399,NUMBERS,"Dead, with all they fed on:"
400,NUMBERS,"Till at last, when Time was sated,"
401,NUMBERS,"Only you persisted,"
402,NUMBERS,"Dædal Numbers, sole and same,"
403,NUMBERS,Invisible skeleton frame
404,NUMBERS,Of the peopled earth we tread on--
405,NUMBERS,"Last, as first."
406,NUMBERS,
407,NUMBERS,Because naught can avail
408,NUMBERS,To wound or to tarnish you;
409,NUMBERS,"Because you are neither sold nor bought,"
410,NUMBERS,Because you have not the power to fail
411,NUMBERS,"But live beyond our furthest thought,"
412,NUMBERS,"Strange Numbers, of infinite clue,"
413,NUMBERS,"Beyond fear, beyond ruth,"
414,NUMBERS,You strengthen also me
415,NUMBERS,To be in my own truth.

446,THE CHILDREN DANCING,The raindrops shine and patter
447,THE CHILDREN DANCING,On tossing flowers in May.
448,THE CHILDREN DANCING,
449,THE CHILDREN DANCING,As if those flowers were singing
450,THE CHILDREN DANCING,"For joy of the bright air,"
451,THE CHILDREN DANCING,As if you saw them springing
452,THE CHILDREN DANCING,To dance the breeze--so fair
453,THE CHILDREN DANCING,"The lissom bodies swinging,"
454,THE CHILDREN DANCING,So light the flung-back hair.
455,THE CHILDREN DANCING,
456,THE CHILDREN DANCING,And through the mind enchanted
457,THE CHILDREN DANCING,"A happy river goes,"

478,FAREWELL TO MATHEMATICS,
479,FAREWELL TO MATHEMATICS,I laboured on the anvil of my brain
480,FAREWELL TO MATHEMATICS,And beat a metal out of pageantry.
481,FAREWELL TO MATHEMATICS,Figure and form I carry in my train
482,FAREWELL TO MATHEMATICS,To load the scaffolds of Eternity.

485,FAREWELL TO MATHEMATICS,"Where, in solemn ritual,"
486,FAREWELL TO MATHEMATICS,The great Dead Mathematical
487,FAREWELL TO MATHEMATICS,Wait and wait and wait for me.

499,FAREWELL TO MATHEMATICS,"They say that on a night there came to Euler,"

503,FAREWELL TO MATHEMATICS,Buried from the eyes alone
504,FAREWELL TO MATHEMATICS,"Of men whose sight is made of stone,"

507,FAREWELL TO MATHEMATICS,By the pale gleam of a scimitar.
508,FAREWELL TO MATHEMATICS,
509,FAREWELL TO MATHEMATICS,"Then Euler, mindful of thy lesser need,"
510,FAREWELL TO MATHEMATICS,"Be thou my pilot in this treacherous hour,"

874,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,Do I not know my lover; that his eyes
875,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,Are blinded by this madness of the skies.
876,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,Do I not hear him moaning in the night
877,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,"For one to lead him to his waiting love,"
878,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,"To lead him to the temple of delight,"
879,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,To the white ivory casket where his soul
880,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,Is set with lovely secrets? Do I not hear
881,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,"The little echoes roll, and fade, and fret"
882,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,About the murmuring foliage of the garden
883,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,Wherein the temple lies? Do I not fear
884,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,Lest in the outer glories he be lost
885,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,"And thwarted of his heart's desire, that flies"
886,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,"Like a dove before his coming, and alights"
887,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,Within the inner courtyard of my soul
888,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,Bearing such messages of him who comes
889,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,That all the altars of my love are kindled
890,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,"To flame ere he approaches, which fades away"
891,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,And counterfeits the sweetest death that ever
892,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,"Sighed the approach of day, and left the stars"
893,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,More bright to be entranced of the dawn?
894,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,
895,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,"Be patient, Oh, my heart! A little while"
896,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,And he shall pierce the darkness of the night
897,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,That flows between my home and his. The song
898,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,"The youth, the early light that he has lost"
899,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,Are as a little strength submerged and drowned
900,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,In this fierce rage that bids him seek me out
901,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,"And take me in the darkness of my home,"
902,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,"And change, and fill me, as the virgin night"
903,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,"Is changed to day, and as the moonlight sky"
904,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,"Is emptied of her sterile ray, and filled"
905,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,With overflooding light that spills to earth
906,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,A golden augury of later fruits
907,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,And a diviner birth.
908,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,
909,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,Hark! Hark!... He comes
910,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,"He has found the temple of his soul's desire ...,"
911,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,"Be still, Oh beating heart, be still ... be still,"
912,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,Lest he be troubled now his sacred fire
913,PSYCHE GOES FORTH TO LIFE,Creeps through this temple to your inmost shrine.

1549,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,"Now where on foam-crest waves the seagulls rock,"

1577,SHEPHERD SINGING RAGTIME,This is the song that shepherds must

1821,(A VALENTINE),(A VALENTINE)
1822,(A VALENTINE),
1823,(A VALENTINE),"Which of my palaces? Gold one by one,"
1824,(A VALENTINE),"Of all the splendid houses of my throne,"
1825,(A VALENTINE),This day in grave thought have I over-gone:
1826,(A VALENTINE),Those roofs of stars where I have lived alone
1827,(A VALENTINE),Gladly with God; those blue-encompassed bowers
1828,(A VALENTINE),"Hushed round with lakes, and guarded with still flowers,"
1829,(A VALENTINE),"Where I have watched a face from eve till morn,"
1830,(A VALENTINE),Wondering at being born--
1831,(A VALENTINE),"Then on from morn again till the next eve,"
1832,(A VALENTINE),"Still with strange eyes, unable to believe;"
1833,(A VALENTINE),"And yet, though week and month and year went by."
1834,(A VALENTINE),Incredulous of my ensorcelled eye.
1835,(A VALENTINE),"O had I thus in trance for ever stayed,"
1836,(A VALENTINE),"Still were she there in the reed-girdled isle,"
1837,(A VALENTINE),And I there still--I who go treading now
1838,(A VALENTINE),"Eternity, a-hungered mile by mile:"
1839,(A VALENTINE),"Because I pressed one kiss upon her brow,--"
1840,(A VALENTINE),After a thousand years that seemed an hour
1841,(A VALENTINE),"Of looking on my flower,"
1842,(A VALENTINE),"After that patient planetary fast,"
1843,(A VALENTINE),One kiss at last;
1844,(A VALENTINE),One kiss--and then strange dust that once was she.
1845,(A VALENTINE),
1846,(A VALENTINE),"Sayest thou, Rose, ""What is all this to me?"""
1847,(A VALENTINE),"This would I answer, if it pleaseth thee,"
1848,(A VALENTINE),Thou Rose and Nightingale so strangely one:
1849,(A VALENTINE),"That of my palaces, gold one by one,"
1850,(A VALENTINE),"I fell a-thinking, pondering which to-day,"
1851,(A VALENTINE),"The day of the Blessed Saint, Saint Valentine,"
1852,(A VALENTINE),"Which of those many palaces of mine,"
1853,(A VALENTINE),"I, with bowed head and lowly bended knee,"
1854,(A VALENTINE),Might bring to thee.
1855,(A VALENTINE),O which of all my lordly roofs that rise
1856,(A VALENTINE),To kiss the starry skies
1857,(A VALENTINE),"May with great beams make safe that golden head,"
1858,(A VALENTINE),With all that treasure of hair showered and spread.
1859,(A VALENTINE),Careless as though it were not gold at all--
1860,(A VALENTINE),Yet in the midnight lighting the black hall;
1861,(A VALENTINE),And all that whiteness lying there as though
1862,(A VALENTINE),It were but driven snow.
1863,(A VALENTINE),"Pondering on all these pinnacles and towers,"
1864,(A VALENTINE),"That, as I come with trumpets, call me lord,"
1865,(A VALENTINE),"And crown their battlements with girlhood flowers,"
1866,(A VALENTINE),I can but think of one.  'Twas not my sword
1867,(A VALENTINE),"That won it, nor was it aught I did or dreamed,"
1868,(A VALENTINE),But O it is a palace worthy thee!
1869,(A VALENTINE),"For all about it flows the eternal sea,"
1870,(A VALENTINE),A blue moat guarding an immortal queen;
1871,(A VALENTINE),And over it an everlasting crown
1872,(A VALENTINE),"That, as the moon comes and the sun goes down,"
1873,(A VALENTINE),"Adds jewel after jewel, gem on gem,"
1874,(A VALENTINE),To the august appropriate diadem
1875,(A VALENTINE),"Of her, in whom all potencies that are"
1876,(A VALENTINE),"Wield sceptres and with quiet hands control,"
1877,(A VALENTINE),"Kind as that fairy wand the evening star,"
1878,(A VALENTINE),Or the strong angel that we call the soul.
1879,(A VALENTINE),
1880,(A VALENTINE),"Thou splendid girl that seemest the mother of all,"
1881,(A VALENTINE),"Dear Ceres-Aphrodite, with every lure"
1882,(A VALENTINE),"That draws the bee to honey, with the call"
1883,(A VALENTINE),"Of moth-winged night to sinners, yet as pure"
1884,(A VALENTINE),As the white nun that counts the stars for beads;
1885,(A VALENTINE),"Thou blest Madonna of all broken needs,"
1886,(A VALENTINE),"Thou Melusine, thou sister of sorrowing man,"
1887,(A VALENTINE),"Thou wave-like laughter, thou dear sob in the throat,"
1888,(A VALENTINE),"Thou all-enfolding mercy, and thou song"
1889,(A VALENTINE),"That gathers up each wild and wandering note,"
1890,(A VALENTINE),And takes and breaks and heals and breaks the heart
1891,(A VALENTINE),With the omnipotent tenderness of art;
1892,(A VALENTINE),And thou Intelligence of rose-leaves made
1893,(A VALENTINE),That makes that little thing the brain afraid.
1894,(A VALENTINE),
1895,(A VALENTINE),For thee my Castle of the Spring prepares:
1896,(A VALENTINE),"On the four winds are sped my couriers,"
1897,(A VALENTINE),For thee the towered trees are hung with green;
1898,(A VALENTINE),"Once more for thee, O queen,"
1899,(A VALENTINE),The banquet hall with ancient tapestry
1900,(A VALENTINE),Of woven vines grows fair and still more fair.
1901,(A VALENTINE),And ah! how in the minstrel gallery
1902,(A VALENTINE),Again there is the sudden string and stir
1903,(A VALENTINE),"Of music touching the old instruments,"
1904,(A VALENTINE),While on the ancient floor
1905,(A VALENTINE),The rushes as of yore
1906,(A VALENTINE),Nymphs of the house of spring plait for your feet--
1907,(A VALENTINE),Ancestral ornaments.
1908,(A VALENTINE),"And everywhere a hurrying to and fro,"
1909,(A VALENTINE),"And whispers saying, ""She is so sweet--so sweet"";"
1910,(A VALENTINE),"O violets, be ye not too late to blow,"
1911,(A VALENTINE),O daffodils be fleet:
1912,(A VALENTINE),"For, when she comes, all must be in its place,"
1913,(A VALENTINE),"All ready for her entrance at the door,"
1914,(A VALENTINE),"All gladness and all glory for her face,"
1915,(A VALENTINE),All flowers for her flower-feet a floor;
1916,(A VALENTINE),"And, for her sleep at night in that great bed"
1917,(A VALENTINE),"Where her great locks are spread,"
1918,(A VALENTINE),"O be ye ready, ye young woodland streams"
1919,(A VALENTINE),To sing her back her dreams.

2153,LAUS DEO!,"With choirs of song-birds perfected in art,"
2154,LAUS DEO!,And nightingales beneath the summer moon--
2155,LAUS DEO!,"Praise! that this beauty, an unravished bride"
2156,LAUS DEO!,Doth hold her lover still;
2157,LAUS DEO!,"Doth hide and beckon, laugh at me, and hide"
2158,LAUS DEO!,Upon each grassy hill.
2159,LAUS DEO!,
2160,LAUS DEO!,Praise! that I know the dear capricious sky
2161,LAUS DEO!,In every infinitely varied mood--
2162,LAUS DEO!,Yet under her maternal wings can lie
2163,LAUS DEO!,The smallest chick among her countless brood!
2164,LAUS DEO!,Praise! that I hear the strong winds wildly race
2165,LAUS DEO!,"Their chariots on the sea,"
2166,LAUS DEO!,But feel them lift my hair and stroke my face
2167,LAUS DEO!,Softly and tenderly!
2168,LAUS DEO!,
2169,LAUS DEO!,"Praise! for the joy and gladness thou didst send,"
2170,LAUS DEO!,When I have sat in gracious fellowship
2171,LAUS DEO!,In firelight for an evening with a friend.
2172,LAUS DEO!,When wine and magic entered at the lip!
2173,LAUS DEO!,For laughter which the fates can overthrow
2174,LAUS DEO!,Thy mercy doth accord--
2175,LAUS DEO!,"To Thee, who didst my godlike joy bestow,"
2176,LAUS DEO!,"I lift my glass, O Lord!"
2177,LAUS DEO!,
2178,LAUS DEO!,"Praise! that a lady leaning from her height,"
2179,LAUS DEO!,"A lady pitiful, a tender maid,"
2180,LAUS DEO!,"A queen majestical unto my sight,"
2181,LAUS DEO!,"Spoke words of love to me, and sweetly laid"
2182,LAUS DEO!,Her hand within my own unworthy hand!
2183,LAUS DEO!,"(Rise, soul, to greet thy guest,"
2184,LAUS DEO!,"Mysterious love, whom none shall understand,"
2185,LAUS DEO!,Though love be all confessed!)
2186,LAUS DEO!,
2187,LAUS DEO!,Praise! that upon my bent and bleeding back
2188,LAUS DEO!,"Was stretched some share of Thy redeeming cross,"
2189,LAUS DEO!,"Some poverty as largess for my lack,"
2190,LAUS DEO!,Some loss that shall prevent my utter loss!
2191,LAUS DEO!,Praise! that thou gavest me to keep joy sweet
2192,LAUS DEO!,The sanguine salt of pain!
2193,LAUS DEO!,Praise! for the weariness of questing feet
2194,LAUS DEO!,That else might quest in vain!
2195,LAUS DEO!,

2212,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY
2213,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,
2214,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Dear exile from the hurrying crowd,"
2215,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,At work I muse to you aloud;
2216,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Thought on my anvil softens, glows,"
2217,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,And I forget our art has foes;
2218,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"For life, the mother of beauty, seems"
2219,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,A joyous sleep with waking dreams.
2220,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Then the toy armoury of the brain
2221,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Opining, judging, looks as vain"
2222,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,As trowels silver gilt for use
2223,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Of mayors and kings, who have to lay"
2224,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Foundation stones in hope they may
2225,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Be honoured for walls others build.
2226,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"I, in amicable muse,"
2227,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"With fathomless wonder only filled,"
2228,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Whisper over to your ear
2229,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Listening two hundred odd miles north,"
2230,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"And give thought chase that, were you here,"
2231,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Our talk would never run to earth.
2232,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,
2233,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Man can answer no momentous question:
2234,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Whence comes his spirit? Has it lived before?
2235,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Reason fails; hot springs of feeling spout
2236,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Their snowy columns high in the dim land
2237,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Of his surmise--violent divine decisions
2238,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,That often rule him: and at times he views
2239,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Portraits of places he has never been to,"
2240,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Yet more minute and vivid than remembrance,"
2241,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Of boyhood homes, sail between sleep and waking"
2242,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Like some mirage, refuting all experience"
2243,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"With topsy-turvy ships,"
2244,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,That steals by in dead calms through tropic haze:
2245,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"And many a man in his climacteric years,"
2246,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Thoughts and remembered words have roused from sleep
2247,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,With knowledge that he lacked on lying down:
2248,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"And I, lapped in a trance of reverie, doubt"
2249,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Some spore of episodes
2250,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Anterior far beyond this body's birth,"
2251,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Dispersed like puffs of dust impalpable,"
2252,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Wind-carried round this globe for centuries,"
2253,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"May, breathed with common air, yet swim the blood,"
2254,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"And striking root in this or that brain, raise"
2255,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Imaginations unaccountable;
2256,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"One such seems half-implied in all I am,"
2257,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,And many times re-pondered shapes like this:
2258,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,
2259,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,A child myself I watched a woman loll
2260,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Like to a clot of seaweed thrown ashore;
2261,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Heavy and limp as cloth soaked in black dye,"
2262,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,She glooms the noontide dazzle where a bay
2263,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Bites into vineyarded flats close-fenced by hills,"
2264,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Over whose tops lap forests of cork and fir
2265,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,And reach in places half down their rough slopes.
2266,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Lower, some few cleared fields square on the thickets"
2267,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Of junipers and longer thorns than furze
2268,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,So clumped that they are trackless even for goats
2269,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,I know two things about that woman: first
2270,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"She is a slave and I am free, and next"
2271,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,As mothers need their sons' love she needs mine.
2272,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Longings to utter fond compassionate sounds
2273,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Stir through me, checked by knowing wiser folk"
2274,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Reprobate such indulgence. Ill at ease,"
2275,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Mute, yet her captive, I thrust brown toes through"
2276,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Loose sand no daily large tides overwhelm
2277,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,To cake and roll it firm and smooth and clean
2278,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"As the Atlantic remakes shores, you know."
2279,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"But there, like trailing skirts, long flaws of wind"
2280,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Obliterate the prints feet during calms
2281,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Track over and over its always lonely stretch,"
2282,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Till some will have, it ghosts must rove at night;"
2283,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"For folk by day are rare, yet a still week"
2284,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Leaves hardly ten yards anywhere uncrossed;
2285,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Tempest spreads all revirginate like snow,"
2286,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Half burying dead wood snapped off from tossed trees,"
2287,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Since right along the foreshore, out of reach"
2288,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Of furious driven waves, three hundred pines"
2289,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Straggle the marches between sand and soil.
2290,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Like maps of stone-walled fields their branching roots
2291,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Hold the silt still so that thin grass grows there,"
2292,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Its blades whitened with travelling powdery drift
2293,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,The besom of the lightest breeze sets stirring.
2294,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"That woman's gaze toils worn from remote years,"
2295,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Yet forward yearns through the bright spacious noon,"
2296,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Beyond the farthest isle, whose filmy shape"
2297,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Floats faint on the sea-line.
2298,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"I, scooping grains up with the frail half-shell"
2299,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Pale green and white-lined of sea-urchin, knew"
2300,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,What her eyes sought as often children know
2301,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Of grief or sin they could not name or think of
2302,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Yet sooth or shrink from, so I saw and longed"
2303,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,To heal her tender wound and yet said naught.
2304,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,The energy of bygone joy and pain
2305,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Had left her listless figure charged with magic
2306,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,That caught and held my idleness near hers.
2307,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Resentful of her power, my spirit chafed"
2308,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Against its own deep pity, as though it were"
2309,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Raised ghost and she the witch had bid it haunt me.
2310,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,What's more I knew this slave by rights should glean
2311,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"And faggot drift-wood, not lounge there and waste"
2312,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,My father's food dreaming his time away.
2313,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,For then as now the common-minded rich
2314,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Grudged ease to those whose toil brought them in means
2315,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"For every waste of life. At length I spoke,"
2316,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Insulting both my inarticulate soul
2317,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"And her with acted anger: ""Lazy wretch,"
2318,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Is it for eyes like yours to watch the sea
2319,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,As though you waited for a homing ship?
2320,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,My father might with reason spend his hours
2321,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Scanning the far horizon; for his Swan
2322,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Whose outward lading was full half a vintage
2323,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Is now months overdue."" She turned on me"
2324,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Her languor knit and, through its homespun wrap,"
2325,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Her muscular frame gave hints of rebel will,"
2326,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"While those great caves of night, her eyes, faced mine,"
2327,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Dread with the silence of unuttered wrongs:
2328,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,At last she spoke as one who must be heeded.
2329,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Truly I am not clear
2330,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Whether her meaning was conveyed in words
2331,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,(She mingled accents of an eastern tongue
2332,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,With deformed phrases of our native Latin)
2333,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Or whether thought from her gaze poured through mine.
2334,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,The gravity of recollected life
2335,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Was hers, condensed and, like a vision, flashed"
2336,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Suddenly on the guilty mind, a whole"
2337,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Compact, no longer a mere tedious string"
2338,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Of moments negligible, each so small"
2339,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"As they were lived, but stark like a slain man"
2340,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Who would alive have been ourself with twice
2341,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"The skill, the knowledge, the vitality"
2342,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Actually ours. Yea, as a tree may view"
2343,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"With fingerless boughs and lorn pole impotent,"
2344,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"An elephant gorged upon its leaves depart,"
2345,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Men often have reviewed an unwieldy past,"
2346,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"That like a feasted Mammoth, leisured and slow,"
2347,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Turned its back on their warped bones. Even thus,"
2348,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Momentous with reproach, her grave regard"
2349,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Made me feel mean, cashiered of rank and right,"
2350,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,My limbs that twelve good years had nursed were numbed
2351,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"And all their fidgety quicksilver grew stiff,"
2352,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Novel and fevering hallucinations
2353,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Invaded my attention. So daylight
2354,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,When shutters are thrown back spreads through a house;
2355,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,As then the dreams and terrors of the night
2356,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Decamp, so from my mind were driven"
2357,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,All its own thoughts and feelings. Close she leant
2358,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Propped on a swarthy arm, while the other helped"
2359,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"With eloquent gesture potent as wizard wand,"
2360,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Veil the world off as with an airy web,"
2361,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Or flowing tent a-gleam with pictured folds.
2362,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"These tauten and distend--one sea of wheat,"
2363,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Islanded with black cities, borders now"
2364,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,The voluminous blue pavilion of day.
2365,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,There-under to the nearest of those towns
2366,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,This woman younger by ten years made haste
2367,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,While at her side ran a small boy of six.
2368,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"They neared the walls, half a huge double gate"
2369,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Lay prostrate, though the other by stone hinges"
2370,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Hung to its flanking tower. The path they followed
2371,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Threaded an old paved road whose flags were edged
2372,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"With dry grass and dry weeds, even cactuses"
2373,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Had pushed the stones up or found root in muck heaps:
2374,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"The path struck up the slope of the fallen door,"
2375,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Basalt like midnight, o'er which dusty feet"
2376,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Had greyed a passage, for it rested on"
2377,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Some débris fallen from the left-hand tower,"
2378,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,And from its upper edge rude blocks like steps
2379,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Led down into the straight main street, that ran"
2380,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Past eyeless buildings mined as it were from coal,"
2381,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,And earthquake-raised to light. Palaces and
2382,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Roofless wide-flighted colonnaded temples,"
2383,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,The uncemented walls piled-plumb with blocks
2384,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Squared, polished, fitted with daemonic patience."
2385,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Each gaping threshold high again as need be
2386,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Waited a nine-foot lord to enter hall,"
2387,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Where the least draughty corner sheltered now
2388,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Half-tented hut or improvised small home
2389,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"For Arab, brown, light-footed and proud-necked"
2390,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,As was this woman with the compelling voice.
2391,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Their present hutched and hived within that past
2392,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,As bees in the parchment chest of Samson's lion;
2393,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"And all seem conscious that their life was sweet,"
2394,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Like mice who clean their faces after meals
2395,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"And have such grace of movement, when unscared,"
2396,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,As wins the admiration even of those
2397,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Whose stores they rob and soil. I saw her eyes
2398,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Young with contentment in her son
2399,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"And smaller babe and in their handsome sire,"
2400,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,And knew that many a supper had been relished
2401,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,With hearts as joyous as waited while she cooked
2402,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,And served upon returning to their cot
2403,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,In hall where once far other hearts caroused.
2404,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,They and their tribe could never reap a tithe
2405,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Of the vast harvest rustling round those ruins,"
2406,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,And over which a half-moon soon set forth
2407,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"From black hills mounded up both east and south,"
2408,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,While north-west her light played on distant summits;
2409,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,All the huge interspace floored with standing corn
2410,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Which kings afar send soldiery to reap,"
2411,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Who now, beside a long canal cut straight"
2412,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"In ancient days, have pitched their noisy camp"
2413,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Which on that vast staid silence makes a bruise
2414,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Of blare and riot that its robust health
2415,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Will certainly heal in a brief lapse of time.
2416,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,
2417,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"One night, re-thought on after ten whole years,"
2418,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Is like the condor high above the Andes,"
2419,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,A speck with difficulty found again
2420,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Once the attention quits it. And I next
2421,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Descried our woman under breathless noon,"
2422,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Bathing in a clear lane of gliding water
2423,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Whose banks seem lonely as the path of light
2424,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Crossing mid ocean south of Capricorn.
2425,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Her son steals warily after a butterfly
2426,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,And is as hushed with hope to capture it
2427,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,As are the birds with heat. An insect hum
2428,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Circles the spot as round a cymbal's rim,"
2429,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Long after it has clanged, tingles a throb"
2430,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Which in a dream forgets the parent sound,"
2431,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Oppressed by this protracted and awe-filled pause,"
2432,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,She hardly dares to wade the stream and moves
2433,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"As though in dread to wake some sleeping god,"
2434,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Yet still she nears and nears the further bank
2435,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Where there is shade under a shumac's eaves.
2436,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"The brilliant surface cut her right in two,"
2437,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,And the reflection of her bronzed torso
2438,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Hid all beneath the polished gliding mirror;
2439,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,How her face listened to that sleep divine
2440,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Whose audible breath was tuned to dreams of bliss!
2441,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,
2442,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Sudden, as though the woof of heaven were torn,"
2443,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,A strident shout rang from some neighbour shrubs
2444,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Three Nubian soldiers ran upon her with
2445,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Delighted oily faces. Screaming first
2446,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Commands to her small son to make for home,"
2447,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,She laboured to recross the current as when
2448,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,In nightmares the scared soul expects to die
2449,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Tortured by mutiny in limbs like lead,"
2450,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,But as the playful lion of the sea
2451,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Climbs the rock ledges hard by Fingal's cave
2452,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"To throw himself down into deep green baths,"
2453,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"While others barking follow his vigorous lead,"
2454,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,The foremost Abyssinian threw his weight
2455,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Before her with a splash that hid them both,"
2456,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,As the explosion of light-filled liquid parcels
2457,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Shot forth in all directions. In his arms
2458,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"She re-appeared, a tragic terrified face"
2459,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Beside his coarse one laughing with success.
2460,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Squeezing her with a pantomime of love,"
2461,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,He turns to follow an arrow with his eyes
2462,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"That his companion, still upon the bank,"
2463,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Has aimed towards her son's small head that bobbed
2464,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Like a black cork across the basking corn.
2465,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,But from the level of the sunk stream bed
2466,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Neither he nor she could see the target aimed at,"
2467,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Yet in the pause they heard the poor child scream;
2468,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"A second arrow, second scream; she fought,"
2469,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"But soon like bundle bound, hung o'er his shoulder,"
2470,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Helpless as a mouse in cat's mouth carried off
2471,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"In search of quiet, there to play with it."
2472,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Those arrows missed?--or did they not? The child
2473,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Shrieked twice, yet scarcely like a wounded thing"
2474,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,She thought and hoped and still but thinks and hopes.
2475,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Where is that boy? Where is her husband now?
2476,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,While she submitted body to force and soul
2477,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,To the great shuddering violence of despair
2478,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,How had their life progressed in that far place?
2479,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Compassion fused my consciousness with hers
2480,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,And second-sighted eloquence arose
2481,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"To claim my mind for rostrum,"
2482,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,But obstinately tranced
2483,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,My eyes clung to their vision;
2484,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,For regions to explore allure the boy
2485,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,No stretch of thought or sea of feeling tempts.
2486,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Entranced, the mind I then had, haunted"
2487,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Those basalt ruins. High on sable towers
2488,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Some silky patriarchal goat appears
2489,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"And ponders silent streets, or suddenly"
2490,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Some nanny, her huge bag swollen with milk,"
2491,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Trots out on galleries that unfenced run
2492,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Round vacant courts, there, stopped by plaintive kids,"
2493,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Lets them complete their meal. While always, always,"
2494,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Throughout, those mazed, sullen and sun-soaked walls,"
2495,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"The steady, healthy wind,"
2496,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Which often blows for weeks without a lull
2497,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Across that upland plain,"
2498,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Flutes staidly. Moaning
2499,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Continuously as seas
2500,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Or forests before storm,"
2501,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"And, gathering moment,"
2502,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Articulated by her woe, begins"
2503,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,With second-sighted eloquence
2504,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"To wail through me,"
2505,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Nigh as unheeded,"
2506,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,As though it still had been
2507,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Meaningless wind.
2508,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,
2509,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,For ah! the heart is cowed
2510,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"And dares not use her strength,"
2511,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Hears the kind impulse plead
2512,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Against the common avaricious fear,"
2513,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"Grants it but life, though sovereignty was due"
2514,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Or doles it sway but one day out of seven
2515,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Or one a year.
2516,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,
2517,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"So, so, and ever, so"
2518,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,In the close-curtained court
2519,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Those causes are deferred
2520,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Which most import;
2521,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,These wait man's leisure.
2522,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,These daily matters elbow;
2523,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Merely because
2524,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,His panic meanness
2525,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,Jibs blindly ere it hear
2526,TO GORDON BOTTOMLEY,"What wisdom has prepared,"

2930,THE FALL,To round the root and fat the sheaves
2931,THE FALL,And haply garner queens and kings
2932,THE FALL,With falling rain and flying leaves.
2933,THE FALL,
2934,THE FALL,The rain is salt with tears of queens
2935,THE FALL,The leaves are red with blood of kings;
2936,THE FALL,Unknowing what the mystery means
2937,THE FALL,We puzzle at these splendid things.
2938,THE FALL,
2939,THE FALL,"For why great kings and rains should fall,"
2940,THE FALL,"And wherefore leaves and queens should fly,"
2941,THE FALL,"Or such rare wonders be at all,"
2942,THE FALL,You cannot tell; no more can I.
2943,THE FALL,
2944,THE FALL,Yet this we know: new leaves and rain
2945,THE FALL,"Anon shall crown the vernal scene,"

2947,THE FALL,Blows up into a king or queen.

3020,II.,Tales of rich joy and sorrowing.
3021,II.,"She led me to her garden, fair"
