141,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND
142,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,
143,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,O the cushag flower in a fairy bower
144,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,Would shine like a star of gold;
145,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,But when it grows in the farmer's close
146,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,"'Tis a shocking weed, we're told."
147,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,Yet common things
148,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,May have their wings
149,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,To help our souls above;
150,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,"And wayside weeds,"
151,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,"Like kindly deeds,"
152,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,Spring from a father's love.
153,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,
154,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,The cushag flower had fairy power
155,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,"In olden times, you know,"
156,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,To bear you away on a summer's day
157,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,Wherever you wished to go.
158,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,Its golden wings
159,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,Were slender things
160,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,To carry souls aloft;
161,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,"But fairy tales,"
162,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,"Like fresh'ning gales,"
163,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,May have their uses oft.
164,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,
165,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,The cushag flower in a stormy hour
166,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,Shines brighter for the gloom;
167,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,"So kindly deeds, like wayside weeds,"
168,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,May shine when troubles loom.
169,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,"Old folks would say,"
170,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,"In their own day,"
171,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,"When troubles took their fill,"
172,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,"And times were bad,"
173,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,"And hearts were sad,"
174,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,"""There's gool on the cushag still!"""
175,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,
176,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,Now the cushag we know must never grow
177,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,Where the farmer's work is done;
178,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,But along the rills in the heart of the hills
179,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,"The cushag may shine like the sun,"
180,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,Where the golden flowers
181,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,Have fairy powers
182,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,To gladden our hearts with their grace;
183,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,"And in Vannin Veg Veen,"
184,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,"In the valleys green,"
185,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,The cushags have still a place.
186,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,
187,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,
188,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,
189,TO THE CUSHAG'S FRIEND,

339,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,
340,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,The little stream of Ballacowle.
341,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,It tumbles down the Glen
342,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,And hides beneath the lady-fern
343,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,To sparkle out again--
344,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,Then plunges underneath the road
345,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"To seek a devious way,"
346,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"Where lost in quarry refuse now,"
347,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,Its early cradle lay.
348,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,
349,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"A roomy cradle once it was,"
350,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,O'er-arched with spreading trees;
351,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"A tangled Paradise of flowers,"
352,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"Scarce touched by passing breeze,"
353,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"And here, among the primrose tufts,"
354,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"It wound its cheerful way,"
355,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"When, long ago, we wove our wreaths"
356,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,To Welcome in the May
357,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,
358,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"On May Day Eve I wandered there,"
359,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"And, by the old plum tree,"
360,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,I found a bent and aged man
361,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,Who gazed along the lea.
362,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"His dress was of the loaghtan-brown,"
363,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,His hair was white as snow;
364,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,And quietly he rested there
365,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,And watched the streamlet flow.
366,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,
367,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"""Good evening, friend,"" I gently said,"

375,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,
376,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,He laid a bleached and withered hand
377,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,Upon the cold grey wall
378,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"That once was gable of the house,"
379,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,The house of Ballacowle--
380,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,Though little now remains to show
381,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"Where once it stood so fair,"
382,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"And, but the plum tree lives to mark"
383,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,The garden that was there.
384,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,

389,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"We rode along the Cuckoo Field,"
390,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"The skies were blue and fair,"
391,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"And through the Croshag's miry lane,"

397,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,To take us to our weddin'.
398,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"I mind the dogs and childher too,"

403,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,The sunset faded into gray;
404,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"I heard the little stream,"
405,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,It seemed to mingle with his voice
406,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,Like music in a dream.
407,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"No longer could I see his face,"
408,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,But still he murmered low:
409,WHERE I WAS RARIN' TO,"""I came to put a sight once more"

455,THE PHYNODDEREE,Swinging by himself in the Trainman Tree.
456,THE PHYNODDEREE,"I once was lord of a fairy clan,"
457,THE PHYNODDEREE,But I loved a lass in the Isle of Man;
458,THE PHYNODDEREE,"Her eyes were like the shallows of the mountain stream,"
459,THE PHYNODDEREE,Her hair was like the cornfield's golden gleam
460,THE PHYNODDEREE,"Her voice was like the ringdove's, soft and slow,"
461,THE PHYNODDEREE,Her smile was like the sunbeam's--come and go;
462,THE PHYNODDEREE,But alas and alack-a-day!
463,THE PHYNODDEREE,The jealous fairy maids stole my love away.
464,THE PHYNODDEREE,And now I'm all alone in the Tramman Tree.
465,THE PHYNODDEREE,Swinging by myself in the Tramman Tree.
466,THE PHYNODDEREE,Alas and alack-a-day!
467,THE PHYNODDEREE,

469,THE PHYNODDEREE,Swinging by himself in the Tramman Tree.
470,THE PHYNODDEREE,"I was once a prince in the fairy land,"
471,THE PHYNODDEREE,But I failed to come at the king's command;
472,THE PHYNODDEREE,"His wrath was like the thunder in the mountain gills,"
473,THE PHYNODDEREE,His eyes were like the lightning on the lone dark hills;
474,THE PHYNODDEREE,"His voice was like the raging of the boiling tide,"
475,THE PHYNODDEREE,"As he hurled me down to the earth to bide,"
476,THE PHYNODDEREE,And alas and alack-a-day!
477,THE PHYNODDEREE,The whole night long I must work away
478,THE PHYNODDEREE,"Till daylight sends me up to the Tramman Tree,"
479,THE PHYNODDEREE,Swinging by myself in the Tramman Tree.
480,THE PHYNODDEREE,Alas and alack-a-day!
481,THE PHYNODDEREE,
482,THE PHYNODDEREE,Ho! ho! the Phynodderee!
483,THE PHYNODDEREE,Swinging by himself in the Tramman Tree.
484,THE PHYNODDEREE,I fetched the stone to Tholt-y-Will;
485,THE PHYNODDEREE,I saved the sheep on the snow-clad hill;
486,THE PHYNODDEREE,I saw the storm was coming while the farmer snored;
487,THE PHYNODDEREE,"I drove the sheep before me while the Howlaa roared,"
488,THE PHYNODDEREE,"I folded them in safety beneath the creg,"
489,THE PHYNODDEREE,And hunted over Snaefell for the loaghtan beg;
490,THE PHYNODDEREE,But alas and alack-a-day.
491,THE PHYNODDEREE,"A witch she was, and she would not stay"
492,THE PHYNODDEREE,"Till daylight sent me up to the Tramman Tree,"

495,THE PHYNODDEREE,
496,THE PHYNODDEREE,Ho! ho! the Phynodderee!
497,THE PHYNODDEREE,Swinging by himself in the Tramman Tree.
498,THE PHYNODDEREE,"I threshed the corn in the lonely night,"
499,THE PHYNODDEREE,And swept the house in the still moonlight.
500,THE PHYNODDEREE,"I watched the sleeping haggart while the dog took rest,"
501,THE PHYNODDEREE,And drove away the witches that dared molest;
502,THE PHYNODDEREE,"I milked the cows at dawning and eased their heads,"
503,THE PHYNODDEREE,"And soothed the patient horses in their tired beds,"
504,THE PHYNODDEREE,But alas and alack-a-day!
505,THE PHYNODDEREE,The farmer thought I worked because I wanted pay
506,THE PHYNODDEREE,And left a coat and breeches for the poor Phynodderee;
507,THE PHYNODDEREE,So his lassie cannot see him in the Tramman Tree
508,THE PHYNODDEREE,Swinging by himself in the Tramman Tree.

997,THE RIDE.,And some came singing after.
998,THE RIDE.,
999,THE RIDE.,My nag was shod with fairy shoes
1000,THE RIDE.,"And bred among the mountains,"
1001,THE RIDE.,And many a moonlight prank she played
1002,THE RIDE.,Along the streams and fountains.
1003,THE RIDE.,
1004,THE RIDE.,We scampered down by Greeba Mills
1005,THE RIDE.,"And on to old St. Trinian's,"
1006,THE RIDE.,And hastened lest the Big Buggane

1008,THE RIDE.,
1009,THE RIDE.,Though steep as Ugh ta breesh ma chree

1018,THE RIDE.,
1019,THE RIDE.,From Greeba Towers to Laxey Glen
1020,THE RIDE.,"Their noble heads up-lifting,"
