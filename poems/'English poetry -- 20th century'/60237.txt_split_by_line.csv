48,PREFACE,"Most or these verses have appeared in the papers--_The Nation, New"
49,PREFACE,"Statesman, Cambridge Magazine_--to the editors of which I tender"
50,PREFACE,"customary dues. Also, in 1917, a dozen were brought together to"
51,PREFACE,"make a little book, _Ad Familiares_, of which a hundred copies"
52,PREFACE,were printed privately. Of these seventy were immediately distributed
53,PREFACE,"amongst my friends, while the remaining thirty have drifted into"
54,PREFACE,the hands of curious amateurs who wrote and asked for them. My
55,PREFACE,stock is now exhausted; but apparently the stock of amateurs is not:
56,PREFACE,"for, from time to time, still reach me civil requests for a copy. What"
57,PREFACE,"can I do? On the one hand, my vanity is outraged by the idea of people"
58,PREFACE,"anxious but unable to read me; on the other, I am too mean to print"
59,PREFACE,for their benefit at my own expense. What I have done is to accept
60,PREFACE,with joy an offer by the Hogarth Press to publish a complete edition
61,PREFACE,"of my poems--seventeen in number. Thus, in future, without being at"
62,PREFACE,"pains to write a flattering letter, and at a trifling cost, any amateur"
63,PREFACE,can acquire the works of an extremely rare poet.

157,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,"Books are the quiet monitors of mind,"
158,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,"They prompt its motions, shape its ways, they find"
159,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,"A road through mazes to the higher ground,"
160,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,Whence to explore the sky-bound marches. Round
161,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,About us lie the open downs. Our days
162,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,Still ask a guide and goad. Wherefore always
163,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,We meditate wise thoughts and passionate lays;
164,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,Wherefore I send a book.
165,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,
166,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,Books are the mind's last symbol. They express
167,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,Its visions and its subtleties--a dress
168,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,Material for the immaterial things
169,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,That soar to immortality on wings
170,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,"Of words, and live, by magic of the pen,"
171,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,"Where dead minds live, upon the lips of men"

173,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,"Drawing a little near, prophetically,"
174,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,Send you a book.
175,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,
176,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,Books are the heart's memorial. They shall

179,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,"Thrilling self-knowledge, half-divined untold"
180,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,"Yearnings, and tongueless agonies, shall unfold"
181,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,Or half unfold to half-illumined eyes.
182,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,The cypress shadows creeping gnomonwise
183,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,Still stretch their purple fingers down the hill
184,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,That hangs above Fiesole; and still
185,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,Your English fireside glows. Do you most dear--
186,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,"Sometimes just guessed at, sometimes very near--"
187,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,"Yet always dear and fairest friend, do you"
188,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,Recall the sunlight and the firelight too?
189,_TO_ A.V.S. WITH A BOOK,"Recall the pregnant hours, the gay delights,"

201,MYSELF TO MYSELF,
202,MYSELF TO MYSELF,
203,MYSELF TO MYSELF,It was the thrush's song I heard
204,MYSELF TO MYSELF,"To-day, in March. And you who came"
205,MYSELF TO MYSELF,"At life through books, whom poets stirred"
206,MYSELF TO MYSELF,"To love of beauty, who the name"
207,MYSELF TO MYSELF,Of art revered and fancy knew
208,MYSELF TO MYSELF,"From earliest days,--why, how should you"
209,MYSELF TO MYSELF,Guess at my feelings when among
210,MYSELF TO MYSELF,The elms I heard the thrush's song?
211,MYSELF TO MYSELF,
212,MYSELF TO MYSELF,"For you the country means a mood,"
213,MYSELF TO MYSELF,"Recalls a poem, lays a scene;"
214,MYSELF TO MYSELF,For you its beauties are more good
215,MYSELF TO MYSELF,Sometimes than paintings: it has been
216,MYSELF TO MYSELF,"Music to calm or move you, still"
217,MYSELF TO MYSELF,A background to your thought and will.
218,MYSELF TO MYSELF,
219,MYSELF TO MYSELF,Nothing for me the country means:
220,MYSELF TO MYSELF,It is. The thrush's earliest song
221,MYSELF TO MYSELF,In the precocious sunshine cleans
222,MYSELF TO MYSELF,My soul of culture. Comes along
223,MYSELF TO MYSELF,"The acrid smell of daffodil,"
224,MYSELF TO MYSELF,Hard from the soil still wet and chill.
225,MYSELF TO MYSELF,
226,MYSELF TO MYSELF,These do not mean. I am content
227,MYSELF TO MYSELF,"To look or listen, passion spent,"
228,MYSELF TO MYSELF,"Far beyond art and thought, and free"
229,MYSELF TO MYSELF,"From Vanity and Jealousy,"
230,MYSELF TO MYSELF,"As free as flower, or bird, or tree,"
231,MYSELF TO MYSELF,"Not to mean anything, but be."

245,SPRING,The poor pink fools that laughing went
246,SPRING,"Naked to meet him, their leaves without,"
247,SPRING,And the meddlesome bees droned round and about.
248,SPRING,
249,SPRING,The sober grey that shrouded the head
250,SPRING,Of the pensive sea he ravished away;
251,SPRING,"He twitched it from her, and gave instead"
252,SPRING,The libertine breezes who ruffle her day;
253,SPRING,Who tease and tousle and toss anew
254,SPRING,Her mourning garment of exquisite blue.
255,SPRING,
256,SPRING,"He cozened the mud-flies out on the heath,"
257,SPRING,Ephemeral butterflies opened their wings;
258,SPRING,The credulous birds from their mates beneath
259,SPRING,Caught up the catch that Eternity sings--
260,SPRING,Sings to the Echoes in Fools' Paradise--
261,SPRING,"""Shall not our folly befool the wise?"""

299,IN A RHYMED LETTER,Bedragged the depths and skimmed the scums
300,IN A RHYMED LETTER,"To catch a dubious rhyme,"
301,IN A RHYMED LETTER,To scold a poetess who fell
302,IN A RHYMED LETTER,"And, though she knew she shouldn't,"
303,IN A RHYMED LETTER,"Wrote down a name that rhymed with ""well"""
304,IN A RHYMED LETTER,"Instead of one that wouldn't,"
305,IN A RHYMED LETTER,"Yet, frankly, tuneful, erring sister,"
306,IN A RHYMED LETTER,"Can one be musical to ""Mister""?"
307,IN A RHYMED LETTER,"A monosyllable, I confess,"
308,IN A RHYMED LETTER,Is what the Muse prefers:
309,IN A RHYMED LETTER,She cut a queen's name down to Bess
310,IN A RHYMED LETTER,And yours is worse than hers:
311,IN A RHYMED LETTER,Meanwhile it takes a better poet
312,IN A RHYMED LETTER,Than I to deal with Mrs. Jowitt.

461,DECEMBER,"""Until they kissed their souls away."
462,DECEMBER,"Still they were young, and, lip to lip,"
463,DECEMBER,They found a way to make Time skip;
464,DECEMBER,And they were bold enough to find
465,DECEMBER,"A way to brave him, mind to mind;"
466,DECEMBER,"And sometimes, by their deadly art,"
467,DECEMBER,"They caught and crushed him, heart to heart."""

498,LETTER TO A LADY II,"Made for singing little songs,"
499,LETTER TO A LADY II,"Made for righting little wrongs,"
500,LETTER TO A LADY II,Made to taste whate'er there be
501,LETTER TO A LADY II,Of loveliness and gaiety
502,LETTER TO A LADY II,On this variegated earth;
503,LETTER TO A LADY II,Made for sentiment and mirth
504,LETTER TO A LADY II,"And light romance, perhaps just worth"
505,LETTER TO A LADY II,"A smile from Art, a nod from Truth,"
506,LETTER TO A LADY II,"I, apt for a fantastic youth"
507,LETTER TO A LADY II,"Of follies, an old age of thought,"

511,LETTER TO A LADY II,"I was made with eyes to see,"

514,LETTER TO A LADY II,"To make most matters fairly plain,"
515,LETTER TO A LADY II,"Enough of health for work or play,"
516,LETTER TO A LADY II,"Of wealth enough to pick my way,"
517,LETTER TO A LADY II,"Sense to enjoy, and arts to bring"
518,LETTER TO A LADY II,"Soft nothings off a softer thing,"
519,LETTER TO A LADY II,"A turn of wit, a taste for ease,"
520,LETTER TO A LADY II,And what had love to do with these?
521,LETTER TO A LADY II,
522,LETTER TO A LADY II,I was made to revel in
523,LETTER TO A LADY II,"The viola and violin,"
524,LETTER TO A LADY II,"The broad bassoon and clarinette,"
525,LETTER TO A LADY II,From every art devised to get
526,LETTER TO A LADY II,Its complement of melody:
527,LETTER TO A LADY II,"Believe me, I was meant to be"
528,LETTER TO A LADY II,"One who smiled back at smiling faces,"
529,LETTER TO A LADY II,"A loiterer in life's pleasant places,"
530,LETTER TO A LADY II,A well of receptivity.
531,LETTER TO A LADY II,
532,LETTER TO A LADY II,I was contrived by God to pull
533,LETTER TO A LADY II,The noses of the very dull;
534,LETTER TO A LADY II,Tweak up as 'twere a cotton gown
535,LETTER TO A LADY II,The law most solemnly laid down;
536,LETTER TO A LADY II,Expressly charged to mock the great
537,LETTER TO A LADY II,And weather-cockwise still girate.
538,LETTER TO A LADY II,"To choose a rose and praise a frill,"
539,LETTER TO A LADY II,"And sometimes cause a tiny thrill,"
540,LETTER TO A LADY II,To be a lover in my fashion--
541,LETTER TO A LADY II,But O! I was not made for passion.
542,LETTER TO A LADY II,
543,LETTER TO A LADY II,"Therefore, dear Lady, if you please"
544,LETTER TO A LADY II,Deal very gingerly with these.
545,LETTER TO A LADY II,"Here is our garden: O, take care"
546,LETTER TO A LADY II,Our passion spoil not our parterre.
547,LETTER TO A LADY II,"Be gracious, Madame, lest your frown"
548,LETTER TO A LADY II,"Should bake the lawns and burn them brown,"
549,LETTER TO A LADY II,"Be very kind, or jealous showers"
550,LETTER TO A LADY II,"May quite dash down our scented flowers,"
551,LETTER TO A LADY II,"And O! be chary of reproof,"
