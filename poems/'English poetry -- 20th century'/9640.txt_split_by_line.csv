43,PREFATORY NOTE,PREFATORY NOTE
44,PREFATORY NOTE,
45,PREFATORY NOTE,"When the fourth volume of this series was published three years ago,"
46,PREFATORY NOTE,"many of the critics who had up till then, as Horace Walpole said of God,"
47,PREFATORY NOTE,"been the dearest creatures in the world to me, took another turn. Not"
48,PREFATORY NOTE,only did they very properly disapprove my choice of poems: they went on
49,PREFATORY NOTE,to write as if the Editor of 'Georgian Poetry' were a kind of public
50,PREFATORY NOTE,"functionary, like the President of the Royal Academy; and they"
51,PREFATORY NOTE,"asked--again, on this assumption, very properly--who was E.M. that he"
52,PREFATORY NOTE,"should bestow and withhold crowns and sceptres, and decide that this or"
53,PREFATORY NOTE,that poet was or was not to count.
54,PREFATORY NOTE,
55,PREFATORY NOTE,"This, in the words of Pirate Smee, was 'a kind of a compliment', but it"
56,PREFATORY NOTE,"was also, to quote the same hero, 'galling'; and I have wished for an"
57,PREFATORY NOTE,opportunity of disowning the pretension which I found attributed to me
58,PREFATORY NOTE,"of setting up as a pundit, or a pontiff, or a Petronius Arbiter; for I"
59,PREFATORY NOTE,"have neither the sure taste, nor the exhaustive reading, nor the ample"
60,PREFATORY NOTE,leisure which would be necessary in any such role.
61,PREFATORY NOTE,
62,PREFATORY NOTE,"The origin of these books, which is set forth in the memoir of Rupert"
63,PREFATORY NOTE,"Brooke, was simple and humble. I found, ten years ago, that there were a"
64,PREFATORY NOTE,"number of writers doing work which appeared to me extremely good, but"
65,PREFATORY NOTE,"which was narrowly known; and I thought that anyone, however"
66,PREFATORY NOTE,"unprofessional and meagrely gifted, who presented a conspectus of it in"
67,PREFATORY NOTE,a challenging and manageable form might be doing a good turn both to the
68,PREFATORY NOTE,"poets and to the reading public. So, I think I may claim, it proved to"
69,PREFATORY NOTE,be. The first volume seemed to supply a want. It was eagerly bought; the
70,PREFATORY NOTE,continuation of the affair was at once taken so much for granted as to
71,PREFATORY NOTE,be almost unavoidable; and there has been no break in the demand for the
72,PREFATORY NOTE,"successive books. If they have won for themselves any position, there is"
73,PREFATORY NOTE,no possible reason except the pleasure they have given.
74,PREFATORY NOTE,
75,PREFATORY NOTE,"Having entered upon a course of disclamation, I should like to make a"
76,PREFATORY NOTE,mild protest against a further charge that Georgian Poetry has merely
77,PREFATORY NOTE,encouraged a small clique of mutually indistinguishable poetasters to
78,PREFATORY NOTE,abound in their own and each other's sense or nonsense. It is natural
79,PREFATORY NOTE,that the poets of a generation should have points in common; but to my
80,PREFATORY NOTE,fond eye those who have graced these collections look as diverse as
81,PREFATORY NOTE,"sheep to their shepherd, or the members of a Chinese family to their"
82,PREFATORY NOTE,uncle; and if there is an allegation which I would 'deny with both
83,PREFATORY NOTE,"hands', it is this: that an insipid sameness is the chief characteristic"
84,PREFATORY NOTE,of an anthology which offers--to name almost at random seven only out of
85,PREFATORY NOTE,"forty (oh ominous academic number!)--the work of Messrs. Abercrombie,"
86,PREFATORY NOTE,"Davies, de la Mare, Graves, Lawrence, Nichols and Squire."
87,PREFATORY NOTE,
88,PREFATORY NOTE,The ideal 'Georgian Poetry'--a book which would err neither by omission
89,PREFATORY NOTE,"nor by inclusion, and would contain the best, and only the best poems of"
90,PREFATORY NOTE,"the best, and only the best poets of the day--could only be achieved, if"
91,PREFATORY NOTE,"at all, by dint of a Royal Commission. The present volume is nothing of"
92,PREFATORY NOTE,the kind.
93,PREFATORY NOTE,
94,PREFATORY NOTE,I may add one word bearing on my aim in selection. Much admired modern
95,PREFATORY NOTE,"work seems to me, in its lack of inspiration and its disregard of form,"
96,PREFATORY NOTE,like gravy imitating lava. Its upholders may retort that much of the
97,PREFATORY NOTE,"work which I prefer seems to them, in its lack of inspiration and its"
98,PREFATORY NOTE,"comparative finish, like tapioca imitating pearls. Either view--possibly"
99,PREFATORY NOTE,both--may be right. I will only say that with an occasional exception
100,PREFATORY NOTE,for some piece of rebelliousness or even levity which may have taken my
101,PREFATORY NOTE,"fancy, I have tried to choose no verse but such as in Wordsworth's phrase"
102,PREFATORY NOTE,
103,PREFATORY NOTE,The high and tender Muses shall accept
104,PREFATORY NOTE,"With gracious smile, deliberately pleased."
105,PREFATORY NOTE,
106,PREFATORY NOTE,"There are seven new-comers--Messrs. Armstrong, Blunden, Hughes, Kerr,"
107,PREFATORY NOTE,"Prewett and Quennell, and Miss Sackville-West. Thanks and"
108,PREFATORY NOTE,"acknowledgments are due to Messrs. Jonathan Cape, Chatto and Windus, R."

110,PREFATORY NOTE,"Stoughton, John Lane, Macmillan, Martin Secker, Selwyn and Blount,"
111,PREFATORY NOTE,"Sidgwick and Jackson, and the Golden Cockerel Press; and to the Editors"

349,RYTON FIRS,"A bed for summer afternoons, this grass;"
350,RYTON FIRS,"But in the Spring, not too softly entangling"
351,RYTON FIRS,"For lively feet to dance on, when the green"
352,RYTON FIRS,"Flashes with daffodils. From Marcle way,"
353,RYTON FIRS,"From Dymock, Kempley, Newent, Bromesberrow,"
354,RYTON FIRS,"Redmarley, all the meadowland daffodils seem"
355,RYTON FIRS,"Running in golden tides to Ryton Firs,"
356,RYTON FIRS,To make the knot of steep little wooded hills
357,RYTON FIRS,Their brightest show: O bella età de l'oro!
358,RYTON FIRS,"Now I breathe you again, my woods of Ryton:"
359,RYTON FIRS,Not only golden with your daffodil-fires
360,RYTON FIRS,Lying in pools on the loose dusky ground
361,RYTON FIRS,"Beneath the larches, tumbling in broad rivers"
362,RYTON FIRS,Down sloping grass under the cherry trees
363,RYTON FIRS,And birches: but among your branches clinging
364,RYTON FIRS,A mist of that Ferrara-gold I first
365,RYTON FIRS,Loved in the easy hours then green with you;
366,RYTON FIRS,"And as I stroll about you now, I have"
367,RYTON FIRS,Accompanying me--like troops of lads and lasses
368,RYTON FIRS,Chattering and dancing in a shining fortune--
369,RYTON FIRS,Those mornings when your alleys of long light
370,RYTON FIRS,And your brown rosin-scented shadows were
371,RYTON FIRS,Enchanted with the laughter of my boys.
372,RYTON FIRS,
373,RYTON FIRS,
374,RYTON FIRS,'The Voices in the Dream'
375,RYTON FIRS,
376,RYTON FIRS,"Follow my heart, my dancing feet,"
377,RYTON FIRS,Dance as blithe as my heart can beat.
378,RYTON FIRS,Only can dancing understand
379,RYTON FIRS,What a heavenly way we pass
380,RYTON FIRS,"Treading the green and golden land,"
381,RYTON FIRS,Daffodillies and grass.
382,RYTON FIRS,
383,RYTON FIRS,"I had a song, too, on my road,"
384,RYTON FIRS,But mine was in my eyes;
385,RYTON FIRS,"For Malvern Hills were with me all the way,"
386,RYTON FIRS,Singing loveliest visible melodies
387,RYTON FIRS,Blue as a south-sea bay;
388,RYTON FIRS,And ruddy as wine of France
389,RYTON FIRS,Breadths of new-turn'd ploughland under them glowed.
390,RYTON FIRS,'Twas my heart then must dance
391,RYTON FIRS,To dwell in my delight;
392,RYTON FIRS,No need to sing when all in song my sight
393,RYTON FIRS,Moved over hills so musically made
394,RYTON FIRS,And with such colour played.--
395,RYTON FIRS,And only yesterday it was I saw
396,RYTON FIRS,Veil'd in streamers of grey wavering smoke
397,RYTON FIRS,My shapely Malvern Hills.
398,RYTON FIRS,That was the last hail-storm to trouble spring:
399,RYTON FIRS,"He came in gloomy haste,"
400,RYTON FIRS,"Pusht in front of the white clouds quietly basking,"
401,RYTON FIRS,In such a hurry he tript against the hills
402,RYTON FIRS,And stumbling forward spilt over his shoulders
403,RYTON FIRS,"All his black baggage held,"
404,RYTON FIRS,Streaking downpour of hail.
405,RYTON FIRS,"Then fled dismayed, and the sun in golden glee"
406,RYTON FIRS,And the high white clouds laught down his dusky ghost.
407,RYTON FIRS,
408,RYTON FIRS,For all that's left of winter
409,RYTON FIRS,Is moisture in the ground.
410,RYTON FIRS,"When I came down the valley last, the sun"
411,RYTON FIRS,"Just thawed the grass and made me gentle turf,"
412,RYTON FIRS,But still the frost was bony underneath.
413,RYTON FIRS,"Now moles take burrowing jaunts abroad, and ply"
414,RYTON FIRS,Their shovelling hands in earth
415,RYTON FIRS,As nimbly as the strokes
416,RYTON FIRS,Of a swimmer in a long dive under water.
417,RYTON FIRS,The meadows in the sun are twice as green
418,RYTON FIRS,"For all the scatter of fresh red mounded earth,"
419,RYTON FIRS,The mischief of the moles:
420,RYTON FIRS,"No dullish red, Glostershire earth new-delved"
421,RYTON FIRS,In April! And I think shows fairest where
422,RYTON FIRS,These rummaging small rogues have been at work.
423,RYTON FIRS,If you will look the way the sunlight slants
424,RYTON FIRS,"Making the grass one great green gem of light,"
425,RYTON FIRS,"Bright earth, crimson and even"
426,RYTON FIRS,"Scarlet, everywhere tracks"
427,RYTON FIRS,The rambling underground affairs of moles:
428,RYTON FIRS,Though 'tis but kestrel-bay
429,RYTON FIRS,Looking against the sun.
430,RYTON FIRS,
431,RYTON FIRS,"But here's the happiest light can lie on ground,"
432,RYTON FIRS,Grass sloping under trees
433,RYTON FIRS,Alive with yellow shine of daffodils!
434,RYTON FIRS,"If quicksilver were gold,"
435,RYTON FIRS,And troubled pools of it shaking in the sun
436,RYTON FIRS,It were not such a fancy of bickering gleam
437,RYTON FIRS,As Ryton daffodils when the air but stirs.
438,RYTON FIRS,And all the miles and miles of meadowland
439,RYTON FIRS,"The spring makes golden ways,"
440,RYTON FIRS,"Lead here, for here the gold"
441,RYTON FIRS,"Grows brightest for our eyes,"
442,RYTON FIRS,And for our hearts lovelier even than love.
443,RYTON FIRS,"So here, each spring, our daffodil festival."
444,RYTON FIRS,
445,RYTON FIRS,How smooth and quick the year
446,RYTON FIRS,Spins me the seasons round!
447,RYTON FIRS,How many days have slid across my mind
448,RYTON FIRS,Since we had snow pitying the frozen ground!
449,RYTON FIRS,Then winter sunshine cheered
450,RYTON FIRS,"The bitter skies; the snow,"
451,RYTON FIRS,"Reluctantly obeying lofty winds,"
452,RYTON FIRS,"Drew off in shining clouds,"
453,RYTON FIRS,Wishing it still might love
454,RYTON FIRS,With its white mercy the cold earth beneath.
455,RYTON FIRS,But when the beautiful ground
456,RYTON FIRS,"Lights upward all the air,"
457,RYTON FIRS,"Noon thaws the frozen eaves,"
458,RYTON FIRS,And makes the rime on post and paling steam
459,RYTON FIRS,Silvery blue smoke in the golden day.
460,RYTON FIRS,And soon from loaded trees in noiseless woods
461,RYTON FIRS,"The snows slip thudding down,"
462,RYTON FIRS,Scattering in their trail
463,RYTON FIRS,Bright icy sparkles through the glittering air;
464,RYTON FIRS,"And the fir-branches, patiently bent so long,"
465,RYTON FIRS,Sigh as they lift themselves to rights again.
466,RYTON FIRS,"Then warm moist hours steal in,"
467,RYTON FIRS,Such as can draw the year's
468,RYTON FIRS,First fragrance from the sap of cherry wood
469,RYTON FIRS,Or from the leaves of budless violets;
470,RYTON FIRS,And travellers in lanes
471,RYTON FIRS,Catch the hot tawny smell
472,RYTON FIRS,Reynard's damp fur left as he sneakt marauding
473,RYTON FIRS,
474,RYTON FIRS,Across from gap to gap:
475,RYTON FIRS,And in the larch woods on the highest boughs
476,RYTON FIRS,The long-eared owls like grey cats sitting still
477,RYTON FIRS,Peer down to quiz the passengers below.
478,RYTON FIRS,
479,RYTON FIRS,Light has killed the winter and all dark dreams.
480,RYTON FIRS,"Now winds live all in light,"
481,RYTON FIRS,"Light has come down to earth and blossoms here,"
482,RYTON FIRS,And we have golden minds.
483,RYTON FIRS,"From out the long shade of a road high-bankt,"
484,RYTON FIRS,I came on shelving fields;
485,RYTON FIRS,"And from my feet cascading,"
486,RYTON FIRS,"Streaming down the land,"
487,RYTON FIRS,Flickering lavish of daffodils flowed and fell;
488,RYTON FIRS,"Like sunlight on a water thrill'd with haste,"
489,RYTON FIRS,"Such clear pale quivering flame,"
490,RYTON FIRS,But a flame even more marvellously yellow.
491,RYTON FIRS,And all the way to Ryton here I walkt
492,RYTON FIRS,Ankle-deep in light.
493,RYTON FIRS,It was as if the world had just begun;
494,RYTON FIRS,And in a mind new-made
495,RYTON FIRS,Of shadowless delight
496,RYTON FIRS,"My spirit drank my flashing senses in,"
497,RYTON FIRS,And gloried to be made
498,RYTON FIRS,Of young mortality.
499,RYTON FIRS,No darker joy than this
500,RYTON FIRS,Golden amazement now
501,RYTON FIRS,Shall dare intrude into our dazzling lives:
502,RYTON FIRS,Stain were it now to know
503,RYTON FIRS,"Mists of sweet warmth and deep delicious colour,"
504,RYTON FIRS,Those lovable accomplices that come
505,RYTON FIRS,Befriending languid hours.

522,THE BUZZARDS,
523,THE BUZZARDS,When evening came and the warm glow grew deeper
524,THE BUZZARDS,And every tree that bordered the green meadows
525,THE BUZZARDS,And in the yellow cornfields every reaper
526,THE BUZZARDS,And every corn-shock stood above their shadows
527,THE BUZZARDS,"Flung eastward from their feet in longer measure,"
528,THE BUZZARDS,Serenely far there swam in the sunny height
529,THE BUZZARDS,A buzzard and his mate who took their pleasure
530,THE BUZZARDS,Swirling and poising idly in golden light.
531,THE BUZZARDS,"On great pied motionless moth-wings borne along,"
532,THE BUZZARDS,"So effortless and so strong,"
533,THE BUZZARDS,"Cutting each other's paths, together they glided,"
534,THE BUZZARDS,Then wheeled asunder till they soared divided
535,THE BUZZARDS,Two valleys' width (as though it were delight
536,THE BUZZARDS,"To part like this, being sure they could unite"
537,THE BUZZARDS,"So swiftly in their empty, free dominion),"
538,THE BUZZARDS,"Curved headlong downward, towered up the sunny steep,"
539,THE BUZZARDS,"Then, with a sudden lift of the one great pinion,"
540,THE BUZZARDS,Swung proudly to a curve and from its height
541,THE BUZZARDS,Took half a mile of sunlight in one long sweep.
542,THE BUZZARDS,
543,THE BUZZARDS,"And we, so small on the swift immense hillside,"
544,THE BUZZARDS,"Stood tranced, until our souls arose uplifted"
545,THE BUZZARDS,"On those far-sweeping, wide,"
546,THE BUZZARDS,"Strong curves of flight,--swayed up and hugely drifted,"
547,THE BUZZARDS,"Were washed, made strong and beautiful in the tide"
548,THE BUZZARDS,"Of sun-bathed air. But far beneath, beholden"
549,THE BUZZARDS,"Through shining deeps of air, the fields were golden"
550,THE BUZZARDS,And rosy burned the heather where cornfields ended.
551,THE BUZZARDS,
552,THE BUZZARDS,"And still those buzzards wheeled, while light withdrew"
553,THE BUZZARDS,"Out of the vales and to surging slopes ascended,"
554,THE BUZZARDS,Till the loftiest-flaming summit died to blue.

559,HONEY HARVEST,
560,HONEY HARVEST,"Late in March, when the days are growing longer"
561,HONEY HARVEST,And sight of early green
562,HONEY HARVEST,"Tells of the coming spring and suns grow stronger,"
563,HONEY HARVEST,Round the pale willow-catkins there are seen
564,HONEY HARVEST,The year's first honey-bees
565,HONEY HARVEST,Stealing the nectar: and bee-masters know
566,HONEY HARVEST,This for the first sign of the honey-flow.
567,HONEY HARVEST,
568,HONEY HARVEST,Then in the dark hillsides the Cherry-trees
569,HONEY HARVEST,Gleam white with loads of blossom where the gleams
570,HONEY HARVEST,"Of piled snow lately hung, and richer streams"
571,HONEY HARVEST,"The honey. Now, if chilly April days"
572,HONEY HARVEST,"Delay the Apple-blossom, and the May's"
573,HONEY HARVEST,"First week come in with sudden summer weather,"
574,HONEY HARVEST,"The Apple and the Hawthorn bloom together,"
575,HONEY HARVEST,And all day long the plundering hordes go round
576,HONEY HARVEST,And every overweighted blossom nods.
577,HONEY HARVEST,But from that gathered essence they compound
578,HONEY HARVEST,Honey more sweet than nectar of the gods.
579,HONEY HARVEST,
580,HONEY HARVEST,"Those blossoms fall ere June, warm June that brings"
581,HONEY HARVEST,"The small white Clover. Field by scented field,"
582,HONEY HARVEST,"Round farms like islands in the rolling weald,"
583,HONEY HARVEST,It spreads thick-flowering or in wildness springs
584,HONEY HARVEST,"Short-stemmed upon the naked downs, to yield"
585,HONEY HARVEST,"A richer store of honey than the Rose,"
586,HONEY HARVEST,"The Pink, the Honeysuckle. Thence there flows"
587,HONEY HARVEST,"Nectar of clearest amber, redolent"
588,HONEY HARVEST,Of every flowery scent
589,HONEY HARVEST,That the warm wind upgathers as he goes.
590,HONEY HARVEST,
591,HONEY HARVEST,In mid-July be ready for the noise
592,HONEY HARVEST,"Of million bees in old Lime-avenues,"
593,HONEY HARVEST,As though hot noon had found a droning voice
594,HONEY HARVEST,To ease her soul. Here for those busy crews
595,HONEY HARVEST,Green leaves and pale-stemmed clusters of green strong flowers
596,HONEY HARVEST,"Build heavy-perfumed, cool, green-twilight bowers"
597,HONEY HARVEST,"Whence, load by load, through the long summer days"
598,HONEY HARVEST,They fill their glassy cells
599,HONEY HARVEST,"With dark green honey, clear as chrysoprase,"
600,HONEY HARVEST,Which housewives shun; but the bee-master tells
601,HONEY HARVEST,This brand is more delicious than all else.
602,HONEY HARVEST,
603,HONEY HARVEST,"In August-time, if moors are near at hand,"
604,HONEY HARVEST,Be wise and in the evening-twilight load
605,HONEY HARVEST,"Your hives upon a cart, and take the road"
606,HONEY HARVEST,"By night: that, ere the early dawn shall spring"
607,HONEY HARVEST,"And all the hills turn rosy with the Ling,"
608,HONEY HARVEST,Each waking hive may stand
609,HONEY HARVEST,Established in its new-appointed land
610,HONEY HARVEST,"Without harm taken, and the earliest flights"
611,HONEY HARVEST,Set out at once to loot the heathery heights.
612,HONEY HARVEST,
613,HONEY HARVEST,That vintage of the Heather yields so dense
614,HONEY HARVEST,And glutinous a syrup that it foils
615,HONEY HARVEST,Him who would spare the comb and drain from thence
616,HONEY HARVEST,"Its dark, full-flavoured spoils:"
617,HONEY HARVEST,For he must squeeze to wreck the beautiful
618,HONEY HARVEST,Frail edifice. Not otherwise he sacks
619,HONEY HARVEST,Those many-chambered palaces of wax.
620,HONEY HARVEST,
621,HONEY HARVEST,"Then let a choice of every kind be made,"
622,HONEY HARVEST,"And, labelled, set upon your storehouse racks--"
623,HONEY HARVEST,Of Hawthorn-honey that of almond smacks:
624,HONEY HARVEST,"The luscious Lime-tree-honey, green as jade:"
625,HONEY HARVEST,"Pale Willow-honey, hived by the first rover:"
626,HONEY HARVEST,That delicate honey culled
627,HONEY HARVEST,"From Apple-blosson, that of sunlight tastes:"
628,HONEY HARVEST,And sunlight-coloured honey of the Clover.
629,HONEY HARVEST,"Then, when the late year wastes,"
630,HONEY HARVEST,When night falls early and the noon is dulled
631,HONEY HARVEST,"And the last warm days are over,"
632,HONEY HARVEST,Unlock the store and to your table bring
633,HONEY HARVEST,Essence of every blossom of the spring.
634,HONEY HARVEST,"And if, when wind has never ceased to blow"
635,HONEY HARVEST,"All night, you wake to roofs and trees becalmed"
636,HONEY HARVEST,"In level wastes of snow,"
637,HONEY HARVEST,"Bring out the Lime-tree-honey, the embalmed"
638,HONEY HARVEST,"Soul of a lost July, or Heather-spiced"
639,HONEY HARVEST,Brown-gleaming comb wherein sleeps crystallised
640,HONEY HARVEST,All the hot perfume of the heathery slope.
641,HONEY HARVEST,"And, tasting and remembering, live in hope."

646,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
647,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Miss Thompson      In her lone cottage on the downs,"
648,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,at Home.           With winds and blizzards and great crowns
649,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Of shining cloud, with wheeling plover"
650,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"And short grass sweet with the small white clover,"
651,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Miss Thompson lived, correct and meek,"
652,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"A lonely spinster, and every week"
653,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,On market-day she used to go
654,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Into the little town below,"
655,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Tucked in the great downs' hollow bowl
656,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Like pebbles gathered in a shoal.
657,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
658,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
659,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"She goes           So, having washed her plates and cup"
660,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"a-Marketing.       And banked the kitchen-fire up,"
661,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Miss Thompson slipped upstairs and dressed,"
662,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Put on her black (her second best),"
663,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"The bonnet trimmed with rusty plush,"
664,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Peeped in the glass with simpering blush,"
665,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,From camphor-smelling cupboard took
666,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Her thicker jacket off the hook
667,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Because the day might turn to cold.
668,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Then, ready, slipped downstairs and rolled"
669,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"The hearthrug back; then searched about,"
670,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Found her basket, ventured out,"
671,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Snecked the door and paused to lock it
672,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And plunge the key in some deep pocket.
673,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Then as she tripped demurely down
674,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"The steep descent, the little town"
675,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Spread wider till its sprawling street
676,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Enclosed her and her footfalls beat
677,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"On hard stone pavement, and she felt"
678,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Those throbbing ecstasies that melt
679,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Through heart and mind, as, happy, free,"
680,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Her small, prim personality"
681,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Merged into the seething strife
682,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Of auction-marts and city life.
683,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
684,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
685,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,She visits         Serenely down the busy stream
686,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,the Boot-maker.    Miss Thompson floated in a dream.
687,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Now, hovering bee-like, she would stop"
688,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Entranced before some tempting shop,"
689,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Getting in people's way and prying
690,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,At things she never thought of buying:
691,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Now wafted on without an aim,"
692,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Until in course of time she came
693,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,To Watson's bootshop. Long she pries
694,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,At boots and shoes of every size--
695,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Brown football-boots with bar and stud
696,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"For boys that scuffle in the mud,"
697,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And dancing-pumps with pointed toes
698,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Glossy as jet, and dull black bows;"
699,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Slim ladies' shoes with two-inch heel
700,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And sprinkled beads of gold and steel--
701,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,'How anyone can wear such things!'
702,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,On either side the doorway springs
703,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,(As in a tropic jungle loom
704,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Masses of strange thick-petalled bloom
705,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And fruits mis-shapen) fold on fold
706,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"A growth of sand-shoes rubber-soled,"
707,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Clambering the door-posts, branching, spawning"
708,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Their barbarous bunches like an awning
709,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Over the windows and the doors.
710,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"But, framed among the other stores,"
711,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Something has caught Miss Thompson's eye
712,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"(O worldliness! O vanity!),"
713,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,A pair of slippers--scarlet plush.
714,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Miss Thompson feels a conscious blush
715,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Suffuse her face, as though her thought"
716,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Had ventured further than it ought.
717,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
718,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,But O that colour's rapturous singing
719,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And the answer in her lone heart ringing!
720,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"She turns (O Guardian Angels, stop her"
721,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,From doing anything improper!)
722,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"She turns; and see, she stoops and bungles"
723,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"In through the sand-shoes' hanging jungles,"
724,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Away from light and common sense,"
725,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Into the shop dim-lit and dense
726,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,With smells of polish and tanned hide.
727,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
728,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
729,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Mrs. Watson.       Soon from a dark recess inside
730,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Fat Mrs. Watson comes slip-slop
731,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,To mind the business of the shop.
732,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,She walks flat-footed with a roll--
733,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"A serviceable, homely soul,"
734,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"With kindly, ugly face like dough,"
735,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Hair dull and colourless as tow.
736,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,A huge Scotch pebble fills the space
737,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Between her bosom and her face.
738,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,One sees her making beds all day.
739,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Miss Thompson lets her say her say:
740,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,'So chilly for the time of year.
741,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,It's ages since we saw you here.'
742,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Then, heart a-flutter, speech precise,"
743,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Describes the shoes and asks the price.
744,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"'Them, Miss? Ah, them is six-and-nine.'"
745,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Miss Thompson shudders down the spine
746,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,(Dream of impossible romance).
747,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"She eyes them with a wistful glance,"
748,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Torn between good and evil. Yes,"
749,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
750,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
751,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Wrestles with      For half-a-minute and no less
752,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"a Temptation;      Miss Thompson strives with seven devils,"
753,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Then, soaring over earthly levels,"
754,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
755,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
756,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And is Saved.      Turns from the shoes with lingering touch--
757,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"'Ah, six-and-nine is far too much."
758,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Sorry to trouble you. Good day!'
759,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
760,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
761,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,She visits         A little further down the way
762,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"the Fish-monger.   Stands Miles's fish-shop, whence is shed"
763,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,So strong a smell of fishes dead
764,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,That people of a subtler sense
765,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Hold their breath and hurry thence.
766,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Miss Thompson hovers there and gazes:
767,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Her housewife's knowing eye appraises
768,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Salt and fresh, severely cons"
769,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Kippers bright as tarnished bronze:
770,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Great cods disposed upon the sill,"
771,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Chilly and wet, with gaping gill,"
772,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Flat head, glazed eye, and mute, uncouth,"
773,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Shapeless, wan, old-woman's mouth."
774,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Next a row of soles and plaice
775,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"With querulous and twisted face,"
776,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"And red-eyed bloaters, golden-grey;"
777,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Smoked haddocks ranked in neat array;
778,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,A group of smelts that take the light
779,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Like slips of rainbow, pearly bright;"
780,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Silver trout with rosy spots,"
781,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And coral shrimps with keen black dots
782,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"For eyes, and hard and jointed sheath"
783,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And crisp tails curving underneath.
784,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"But there upon the sanded floor,"
785,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,More wonderful in all that store
786,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Than anything on slab or shelf,"
787,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Stood Miles, the fishmonger, himself."
788,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
789,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
790,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Mr. Miles.         Four-square he stood and filled the place.
791,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,His huge hands and his jolly face
792,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Were red. He had a mouth to quaff
793,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Pint after pint: a sounding laugh,"
794,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"But wheezy at the end, and oft"
795,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,His eyes bulged outwards and he coughed.
796,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Aproned he stood from chin to toe.
797,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,The apron's vertical long flow
798,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Warped grandly outwards to display
799,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"His hale, round belly hung midway,"
800,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Whose apex was securely bound
801,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,With apron-strings wrapped round and round.
802,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Outside, Miss Thompson, small and staid,"
803,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Felt, as she always felt, afraid"
804,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Of this huge man who laughed so loud
805,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And drew the notice of the crowd.
806,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Awhile she paused in timid thought,"
807,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Then promptly hurried in and bought
808,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"'Two kippers, please. Yes, lovely weather.'"
809,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,'Two kippers? Sixpence altogether:'
810,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And in her basket laid the pair
811,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Wrapped face to face in newspaper.
812,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
813,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
814,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Relapses into      Then on she went, as one half blind,"
815,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Temptation:        For things were stirring in her mind;
816,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Then turned about with fixed intent
817,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"And, heading for the bootshop, went"
818,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
819,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
820,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And Falls.         Straight in and bought the scarlet slippers
821,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And popped them in beside the kippers.
822,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
823,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
824,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"She visits         So much for that. From there she tacked,"
825,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"the Chemist,       Still flushed by this decisive act,"
826,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Westward, and came without a stop"
827,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"To Mr. Wren the chemist's shop,"
828,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And stood awhile outside to see
829,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"The tall, big-bellied bottles three--"
830,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Red, blue, and emerald, richly bright"
831,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Each with its burning core of light.
832,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,The bell chimed as she pushed the door.
833,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Spotless the oilcloth on the floor,"
834,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Limpid as water each glass case,"
835,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Each thing precisely in its place.
836,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Rows of small drawers, black-lettered each"
837,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"With curious words of foreign speech,"
838,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Ranked high above the other ware.
839,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"The old strange fragrance filled the air,"
840,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"A fragrance like the garden pink,"
841,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,But tinged with vague medicinal stink
842,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Of camphor, soap, new sponges, blent"
843,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,With chloroform and violet scent.
844,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
845,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
846,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Mr. Wren.          And Wren the chemist, tall and spare,"
847,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Stood gaunt behind his counter there.
848,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Quiet and very wise he seemed,"
849,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"With skull-like face, bald head that gleamed;"
850,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Through spectacles his eyes looked kind.
851,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,He wore a pencil tucked behind
852,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,His ear. And never he mistakes
853,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,The wildest signs the doctor makes
854,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Prescribing drugs. Brown paper, string,"
855,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"He will not use for any thing,"
856,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,But all in neat white parcels packs
857,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And sticks them up with sealing-wax.
858,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Miss Thompson bowed and blushed, and then"
859,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Undoubting bought of Mr. Wren,"
860,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Being free from modern scepticism,"
861,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,A bottle for her rheumatism;
862,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Also some peppermints to take
863,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,In case of wind; an oval cake
864,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Of scented soap; a penny square
865,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Of pungent naphthaline to scare
866,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,The moth. And after Wren had wrapped
867,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"And sealed the lot, Miss Thompson clapped"
868,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Them in beside the fish and shoes;
869,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"'Good day,' she says, and off she goes."
870,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
871,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
872,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Is Led away        Beelike Miss Thompson, whither next?"
873,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"to the Pleasure    Outside, you pause awhile, perplext,"
874,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"of the Town,       Your bearings lost. Then all comes back"
875,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
876,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
877,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Such as Groceries  And round she wheels, hot on the track"
878,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"and Millinery,     Of Giles the grocer, and from there"
879,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"To Emilie the milliner,"
880,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,There to be tempted by the sight
881,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Of hats and blouses fiercely bright.
882,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"(O guard Miss Thompson, Powers that Be,"
883,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,From Crudeness and Vulgarity.)
884,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
885,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
886,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And other          Still on from shop to shop she goes
887,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Allurements        With sharp bird's-eye, enquiring nose,"
888,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Prying and peering, entering some,"
889,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Oblivious of the thought of home.
890,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"The town brimmed up with deep-blue haze,"
891,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"But still she stayed to flit and gaze,"
892,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Her eyes ablur with rapturous sights,"
893,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Her small soul full of small delights,"
894,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Empty her purse, her basket filled."
895,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
896,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
897,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,But at length      The traffic in the town was stilled.
898,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,is Convinced       The clock struck six. Men thronged the inns.
899,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"of Indiscretion.   Dear, dear, she should be home long since."
900,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
901,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
902,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
903,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And Returns        Then as she climbed the misty downs
904,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Home.              The lamps were lighted in the town's
905,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Small streets. She saw them star by star
906,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Multiplying from afar;
907,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Till, mapped beneath her, she could trace"
908,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Each street, and the wide square market-place"
909,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Sunk deeper and deeper as she went
910,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Higher up the steep ascent.
911,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And all that soul-uplifting stir
912,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Step by step fell back from her,"
913,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"The glory gone, the blossoming"
914,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"Shrivelled, and she, a small, frail thing,"
915,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Carrying her laden basket. Till
916,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Darkness and silence of the hill
917,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,Received her in their restful care
918,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And stars came dropping through the air.
919,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,
920,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,"But loudly, sweetly sang the slippers"
921,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,In the basket with the kippers;
922,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,And loud and sweet the answering thrills
923,MISS THOMPSON GOES SHOPPING,From her lone heart on the hills.

964,ALMSWOMEN,"Long, long ago they passed threescore-and-ten,"
965,ALMSWOMEN,And in this doll's house lived together then;

967,ALMSWOMEN,"And their one fear, Death's shadow at the door."
968,ALMSWOMEN,"Each sundown makes them mournful, each sunrise"
969,ALMSWOMEN,Brings back the brightness in their failing eyes.
970,ALMSWOMEN,
971,ALMSWOMEN,How happy go the rich fair-weather days
972,ALMSWOMEN,When on the roadside folk stare in amaze
973,ALMSWOMEN,At such a honeycomb of fruit and flowers
974,ALMSWOMEN,As mellows round their threshold; what long hours

983,ALMSWOMEN,Proud of their wisdom when on gooseberry shoots

988,ALMSWOMEN,Long-winged and lordly.

1011,PERCH-FISHING,And sunlight blurred below; but sultry blue
1012,PERCH-FISHING,Burned yet on the valley water where it hoards
1013,PERCH-FISHING,"Behind the miller's elmen floodgate boards,"
1014,PERCH-FISHING,"And there the wasps, that lodge them ill-concealed"
1015,PERCH-FISHING,"In the vole's empty house, still drove afield"
1016,PERCH-FISHING,To plunder touchwood from old crippled trees
1017,PERCH-FISHING,And build their young ones their hutched nurseries;
1018,PERCH-FISHING,Still creaked the grasshoppers' rasping unison
1019,PERCH-FISHING,Nor had the whisper through the tansies run
1020,PERCH-FISHING,Nor weather-wisest bird gone home.
1021,PERCH-FISHING,How then

1039,PERCH-FISHING,The startled boy might take him in his net
1040,PERCH-FISHING,That folds the other.
1041,PERCH-FISHING,"Slow, while on the clay,"
1042,PERCH-FISHING,"The other flounces, slow he sinks away."
1043,PERCH-FISHING,
1044,PERCH-FISHING,What agony usurps that watery brain
1045,PERCH-FISHING,"For comradeship of twenty summers slain,"
1046,PERCH-FISHING,For such delights below the flashing weir
1047,PERCH-FISHING,"And up the sluice-cut, playing buccaneer"
1048,PERCH-FISHING,Among the minnows; lolling in hot sun
1049,PERCH-FISHING,When bathing vagabonds had drest and done;
1050,PERCH-FISHING,Rootling in salty flannel-weed for meal

1102,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,"Such bloom rose around, and so many birds' cries"
1103,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,That I sang for delight as I followed the way.
1104,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,
1105,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,"I sang for delight in the ripening of spring,"
1106,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,For dandelions even were suns come to earth;
1107,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,Not a moment went by but a new lark took wing
1108,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,To wait on the season with melody's mirth.
1109,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,
1110,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,"Love-making birds were my mates all the road,"
1111,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,And who would wish surer delight for the eye
1112,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,Than to see pairing goldfinches gleaming abroad
1113,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,Or yellowhammers sunning on paling and sty?
1114,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,
1115,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,"And stocks in the almswomen's garden were blown,"
1116,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,With rich Easter roses each side of the door;
1117,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,The lazy white owls in the glade cool and lone
1118,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,Paid calls on their cousins in the elm's chambered core.
1119,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,

1121,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,"Nor could I go burdened with grief, but made merry"

1124,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,
1125,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,"Over the mounds stood the nettles in pride,"

1128,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,And now my dog ate of the grass on her grave.
1129,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,
1130,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,"He licked my hand wondering to see me muse so,"
1131,THE CHILD'S GRAVE,"And wished I would lead on the journey or home,"

1149,APRIL BYEWAY,"Friend whom I never saw, yet dearest friend,"
1150,APRIL BYEWAY,Be with me travelling on the byeway now
1151,APRIL BYEWAY,In April's month and mood: our steps shall bend
1152,APRIL BYEWAY,By the shut smithy with its penthouse brow
1153,APRIL BYEWAY,Armed round with many a felly and crackt plough:
1154,APRIL BYEWAY,And we will mark in his white smock the mill
1155,APRIL BYEWAY,"Standing aloof, long numbed to any wind,"
1156,APRIL BYEWAY,"That in his crannies mourns, and craves him still;"
1157,APRIL BYEWAY,"But now there is not any grain to grind,"
1158,APRIL BYEWAY,And even the master lies too deep for winds to find.
1159,APRIL BYEWAY,
1160,APRIL BYEWAY,Grieve not at these: for there are mills amain
1161,APRIL BYEWAY,With lusty sails that leap and drop away
1162,APRIL BYEWAY,"On further knolls, and lads to fetch the grain."
1163,APRIL BYEWAY,The ash-spit wickets on the green betray
1164,APRIL BYEWAY,New games begun and old ones put away.
1165,APRIL BYEWAY,"Let us fare on, dead friend, O deathless friend,"
1166,APRIL BYEWAY,Where under his old hat as green as moss
1167,APRIL BYEWAY,"The hedger chops and finds new gaps to mend,"
1168,APRIL BYEWAY,"And on his bonfires burns the thorns and dross,"
1169,APRIL BYEWAY,"And hums a hymn, the best, thinks he, that ever was."
1170,APRIL BYEWAY,
1171,APRIL BYEWAY,"There the grey guinea-fowl stands in the way,"
1172,APRIL BYEWAY,"The young black heifer and the raw-ribbed mare,"
1173,APRIL BYEWAY,"And scorn to move for tumbril or for dray,"
1174,APRIL BYEWAY,And feel themselves as good as farmers there.
1175,APRIL BYEWAY,From the young corn the prick-eared leverets stare
1176,APRIL BYEWAY,"At strangers come to spy the land--small sirs,"
1177,APRIL BYEWAY,We bring less danger than the very breeze
1178,APRIL BYEWAY,"Who in great zig-zag blows the bee, and whirs"
1179,APRIL BYEWAY,In bluebell shadow down the bright green leas;
1180,APRIL BYEWAY,From whom in frolic fit the chopt straw darts and flees.
1181,APRIL BYEWAY,
1182,APRIL BYEWAY,The cornel steepling up in white shall know
1183,APRIL BYEWAY,"The two friends passing by, and poplar smile"
1184,APRIL BYEWAY,All gold within; the church-top fowl shall glow
1185,APRIL BYEWAY,"To lure us on, and we shall rest awhile"
1186,APRIL BYEWAY,Where the wild apple blooms above the stile;
1187,APRIL BYEWAY,"The yellow frog beneath blinks up half bold,"
1188,APRIL BYEWAY,Then scares himself into the deeper green.
1189,APRIL BYEWAY,"And thus spring was for you in days of old,"
1190,APRIL BYEWAY,And thus will be when I too walk unseen
1191,APRIL BYEWAY,"By one that thinks me friend, the best that there has been."
1192,APRIL BYEWAY,
1193,APRIL BYEWAY,"All our lone journey laughs for joy, the hours"
1194,APRIL BYEWAY,Like honey-bees go home in new-found light
1195,APRIL BYEWAY,Past the cow pond amazed with twinkling flowers
1196,APRIL BYEWAY,"And antique chalk-pit newly delved to white,"
1197,APRIL BYEWAY,Or idle snow-plough nearly hid from sight.
1198,APRIL BYEWAY,"The blackbird sings us home, on a sudden peers"
1199,APRIL BYEWAY,"The round tower hung with ivy's blackened chains,"
1200,APRIL BYEWAY,"Then past the little green the byeway veers,"
1201,APRIL BYEWAY,"The mill-sweeps torn, the forge with cobwebbed panes"
1202,APRIL BYEWAY,That have so many years looked out across the plains.
1203,APRIL BYEWAY,
1204,APRIL BYEWAY,"But the old forge and mill are shut and done,"
1205,APRIL BYEWAY,"The tower is crumbling down, stone by stone falls;"
1206,APRIL BYEWAY,"An ague doubt comes creeping in the sun,"
1207,APRIL BYEWAY,"The sun himself shudders, the day appals,"
1208,APRIL BYEWAY,The concourse of a thousand tempests sprawls
1209,APRIL BYEWAY,"Over the blue-lipped lakes and maddening groves,"
1210,APRIL BYEWAY,"Like agonies of gods the clouds are whirled,"
1211,APRIL BYEWAY,The stormwind like the demon huntsman roves--
1212,APRIL BYEWAY,"Still stands my friend, though all's to chaos hurled,"
1213,APRIL BYEWAY,"The unseen friend, the one last friend in all the world."

2021,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"In those old days you were called beautiful,"
2022,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,But I have worn the beauty from your face;
2023,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,The flowerlike bloom has withered on your cheek
2024,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"With the harsh years, and the fire in your eyes"
2025,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"Burns darker now and deeper, feeding on"
2026,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,Beauty and the remembrance of things gone.
2027,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"Even your voice is altered when you speak,"
2028,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,Or is grown mute with old anxiety
2029,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,For me.
2030,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,
2031,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,Even as a fire leaps into flame and burns
2032,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"Leaping and laughing in its lovely flight,"
2033,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,And then under the flame a glowing dome
2034,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,Deepens slowly into blood-like light:--
2035,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"So did you flame and in flame take delight,"
2036,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,So are you hollow'd now with aching fire.
2037,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"But I still warm me and make there my home,"
2038,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,Still beauty and youth burn there invisibly
2039,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,For me.
2040,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,
2041,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"Now my lips falling on your silver'd skull,"
2042,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"My fingers in the valleys of your cheeks,"
2043,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"Or my hands in your thin strong hands fast caught,"
2044,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"Your body clutched to mine, mine bent to yours:"
2045,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"Now love undying feeds on love beautiful,"
2046,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"Now, now I am but thought kissing your thought ..."
2047,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,--And can it be in your heart's music speaks
2048,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,A deeper rhythm hearing mine: can it be
2049,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,Indeed for me?

2990,SNAKE,A snake came to my water-trough
2991,SNAKE,"On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,"
2992,SNAKE,To drink there.
2993,SNAKE,
2994,SNAKE,"In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob tree"
2995,SNAKE,I came down the steps with my pitcher
2996,SNAKE,"And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the trough"
2997,SNAKE,before me.
2998,SNAKE,
2999,SNAKE,He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom
3000,SNAKE,"And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over the edge"
3001,SNAKE,of the stone trough
3002,SNAKE,"And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,"
3003,SNAKE,"And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness,"
3004,SNAKE,"He sipped with his straight mouth,"
3005,SNAKE,"Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,"
3006,SNAKE,Silently.
3007,SNAKE,
3008,SNAKE,"Someone was before me at my water-trough,"
3009,SNAKE,"And I, like a second-comer, waiting."
3010,SNAKE,
3011,SNAKE,"He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,"
3012,SNAKE,"And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,"
3013,SNAKE,"And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused a moment,"
3014,SNAKE,"And stooped and drank a little more,"
3015,SNAKE,"Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels of the earth"
3016,SNAKE,"On the day of Sicilian July, with Etna smoking."
3017,SNAKE,
3018,SNAKE,The voice of my education said to me
3019,SNAKE,"He must be killed,"
3020,SNAKE,"For in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold are"
3021,SNAKE,venomous.
3022,SNAKE,
3023,SNAKE,"And voices in me said, If you were a man"
3024,SNAKE,"You would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off."
3025,SNAKE,
3026,SNAKE,"But must I confess how I liked him,"
3027,SNAKE,"How glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink at my"
3028,SNAKE,water-trough
3029,SNAKE,"And depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,"
3030,SNAKE,Into the burning bowels of this earth?
3031,SNAKE,
3032,SNAKE,"Was it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?"
3033,SNAKE,"Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?"
3034,SNAKE,"Was it humility, to feel honoured?"
3035,SNAKE,I felt so honoured.
3036,SNAKE,
3037,SNAKE,And yet those voices:
3038,SNAKE,If you were not afraid you would kill him.
3039,SNAKE,
3040,SNAKE,"And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,"
3041,SNAKE,"But even so, honoured still more"
3042,SNAKE,That he should seek my hospitality
3043,SNAKE,From out the dark door of the secret earth.
3044,SNAKE,
3045,SNAKE,He drank enough
3046,SNAKE,"And lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,"
3047,SNAKE,"And flickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,"
3048,SNAKE,"Seeming to lick his lips,"
3049,SNAKE,"And looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,"
3050,SNAKE,"And slowly turned his head,"
3051,SNAKE,"And slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,"
3052,SNAKE,Proceeded to draw his slow length curving round
3053,SNAKE,And climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.
3054,SNAKE,
3055,SNAKE,"And as he put his head into that dreadful hole,"
3056,SNAKE,"And as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders, and entered"
3057,SNAKE,"further,"
3058,SNAKE,"A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into that"
3059,SNAKE,"horrid black hole,"
3060,SNAKE,"Deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing himself after,"
3061,SNAKE,Overcame me now his back was turned.
3062,SNAKE,
3063,SNAKE,"I looked round, I put down my pitcher,"
3064,SNAKE,I picked up a clumsy log
3065,SNAKE,And threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.
3066,SNAKE,
3067,SNAKE,"I think it did not hit him,"
3068,SNAKE,But suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed in
3069,SNAKE,"undignified haste,"
3070,SNAKE,"Writhed like lightning, and was gone"
3071,SNAKE,"Into the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,"
3072,SNAKE,"At which, in the intense still noon, I stared with fascination."
3073,SNAKE,
3074,SNAKE,And immediately I regretted it.
3075,SNAKE,"I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!"
3076,SNAKE,I despised myself and the voices of my accursed human education.
3077,SNAKE,
3078,SNAKE,"And I thought of the albatross,"
3079,SNAKE,"And I wished he would come back, my snake."
3080,SNAKE,
3081,SNAKE,"For he seemed to me again like a king,"
3082,SNAKE,"Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,"
3083,SNAKE,Now due to be crowned again.
3084,SNAKE,
3085,SNAKE,"And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords"
3086,SNAKE,Of life.
3087,SNAKE,And I have something to expiate:
3088,SNAKE,A pettiness.

3272,NIGHT RHAPSODY,Darkling with soundless sail all set and amply filled
3273,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"By volume of an ever-constant air,"
3274,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"At fullest night, through seas for ever calm,"
3275,NIGHT RHAPSODY,Swept lovely and unknown for ever on.
3276,NIGHT RHAPSODY,
3277,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"How beautiful it is to wake at night,"
3278,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Embalmed in darkness watchful, sweet, and still,"
3279,NIGHT RHAPSODY,As is the brain's mood flattered by the swim
3280,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Of currents circumvolvent in the void,"
3281,NIGHT RHAPSODY,To lie quite still and to become aware
3282,NIGHT RHAPSODY,Of the dim light cast by nocturnal skies
3283,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"On a dim earth beyond the window-ledge,"
3284,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"So, isolate from the friendly company"
3285,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Of the huge universe which turns without,"
3286,NIGHT RHAPSODY,To brood apart in calm and joy awhile
3287,NIGHT RHAPSODY,Until the spirit sinks and scarcely knows
3288,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Whether self is, or if self only is,"
3289,NIGHT RHAPSODY,For ever....
3290,NIGHT RHAPSODY,
3291,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"How beautiful to wake at night,"
3292,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Within the room grown strange, and still, and sweet,"
3293,NIGHT RHAPSODY,And live a century while in the dark
3294,NIGHT RHAPSODY,The dripping wheel of silence slowly turns;
3295,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"To watch the window open on the night,"
3296,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"A dewy silent deep where nothing stirs,"
3297,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"And, lying thus, to feel dilate within"
3298,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"The press, the conflict, and the heavy pulse"
3299,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Of incommunicable sad ecstasy,"
3300,NIGHT RHAPSODY,Growing until the body seems outstretched
3301,NIGHT RHAPSODY,In perfect crucifixion on the arms
3302,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Of a cross pointing from last void to void,"
3303,NIGHT RHAPSODY,While the heart dies to a mere midway spark.
3304,NIGHT RHAPSODY,
3305,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"All happiness thou holdest, happy night,"
3306,NIGHT RHAPSODY,For such as lie awake and feel dissolved
3307,NIGHT RHAPSODY,The peaceful spice of darkness and the cool
3308,NIGHT RHAPSODY,Breath hither blown from the ethereal flowers
3309,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"That mist thy fields! O happy, happy wounds,"
3310,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Conditioned by existence in humanity,"
3311,NIGHT RHAPSODY,That have such powers to heal them! slow sweet sighs
3312,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Torn from the bosom, silent wails, the birth"
3313,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Of such long-treasured tears as pain his eyes,"
3314,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Who, waking, hears the divine solicitudes"
3315,NIGHT RHAPSODY,Of midnight with ineffable purport charged.
3316,NIGHT RHAPSODY,
3317,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"How beautiful it is to wake at night,"
3318,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Another night, in darkness yet more still,"
3319,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Save when the myriad leaves on full-fledged boughs,"
3320,NIGHT RHAPSODY,Filled rather by the perfume's wandering flood
3321,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Than by dispansion of the still sweet air,"
3322,NIGHT RHAPSODY,Shall from the furthest utter silences
3323,NIGHT RHAPSODY,In glimmering secrecy have gathered up
3324,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"An host of whisperings and scattered sighs,"
3325,NIGHT RHAPSODY,To loose at last a sound as of the plunge
3326,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"And lapsing seethe of some Pacific wave,"
3327,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Which, risen from the star-thronged outer troughs,"
3328,NIGHT RHAPSODY,Rolls in to wreathe with circling foam away
3329,NIGHT RHAPSODY,The flutter of the golden moths that haunt
3330,NIGHT RHAPSODY,The star's one glimmer daggered on wet sands.
3331,NIGHT RHAPSODY,
3332,NIGHT RHAPSODY,So beautiful it is to wake at night!
3333,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Imagination, loudening with the surf"
3334,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Of the midsummer wind among the boughs,"
3335,NIGHT RHAPSODY,Gathers my spirit from the haunts remote
3336,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Of faintest silence and the shades of sleep,"
3337,NIGHT RHAPSODY,To bear me on the summit of her wave
3338,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Beyond known shores, beyond the mortal edge"
3339,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Of thought terrestrial, to hold me poised"
3340,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Above the frontiers of infinity,"
3341,NIGHT RHAPSODY,To which in the full reflux of the wave
3342,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Come soon I must, bubble of solving foam,"
3343,NIGHT RHAPSODY,Borne to those other shores--now never mine
3344,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"Save for a hovering instant, short as this"
3345,NIGHT RHAPSODY,Which now sustains me ere I be drawn back--
3346,NIGHT RHAPSODY,"To learn again, and wholly learn, I trust,"
3347,NIGHT RHAPSODY,How beautiful it is to wake at night.

3351,NOVEMBER,NOVEMBER
3352,NOVEMBER,
3353,NOVEMBER,As I walk the misty hill
3354,NOVEMBER,"All is languid, fogged, and still;"
3355,NOVEMBER,Not a note of any bird
3356,NOVEMBER,"Nor any motion's hint is heard,"
3357,NOVEMBER,Save from soaking thickets round
3358,NOVEMBER,"Trickle or water's rushing sound,"
3359,NOVEMBER,And from ghostly trees the drip
3360,NOVEMBER,Of runnel dews or whispering slip
3361,NOVEMBER,"Of leaves, which in a body launch"
3362,NOVEMBER,Listlessly from the stagnant branch
3363,NOVEMBER,"To strew the marl, already strown,"
3364,NOVEMBER,"With litter sodden as its own,"
3365,NOVEMBER,
3366,NOVEMBER,"A rheum, like blight, hangs on the briars,"
3367,NOVEMBER,And from the clammy ground suspires
3368,NOVEMBER,A sweet frail sick autumnal scent
3369,NOVEMBER,Of stale frost furring weeds long spent;
3370,NOVEMBER,"And wafted on, like one who sleeps,"
3371,NOVEMBER,"A feeble vapour hangs or creeps,"
3372,NOVEMBER,Exhaling on the fungus mould
3373,NOVEMBER,"A breath of age, fatigue, and cold."
3374,NOVEMBER,
3375,NOVEMBER,"Oozed from the bracken's desolate track,"
3376,NOVEMBER,By dark rains havocked and drenched black.
3377,NOVEMBER,"A fog about the coppice drifts,"
3378,NOVEMBER,Or slowly thickens up and lifts
3379,NOVEMBER,"Into the moist, despondent air."
3380,NOVEMBER,
3381,NOVEMBER,"Mist, grief, and stillness everywhere...."
3382,NOVEMBER,
3383,NOVEMBER,"And in me, too, there is no sound"
3384,NOVEMBER,"Save welling as of tears profound,"
3385,NOVEMBER,"Where in me cloud, grief, stillness reign,"
3386,NOVEMBER,And an intolerable pain
3387,NOVEMBER,Begins.
3388,NOVEMBER,Rolled on as in a flood there come
3389,NOVEMBER,"Memories of childhood, boyhood, home,"
3390,NOVEMBER,"And that which, sudden, pangs me most,"
3391,NOVEMBER,"Thought of the first-belov'd, long lost,"
3392,NOVEMBER,Too easy lost! My cold lips frame
3393,NOVEMBER,"Tremulously the familiar name,"
3394,NOVEMBER,Unheard of her upon my breath:
3395,NOVEMBER,'Elizabeth. Elizabeth.'
3396,NOVEMBER,
3397,NOVEMBER,"No voice answers on the hill,"
3398,NOVEMBER,"All is shrouded, sad, and still ..."
3399,NOVEMBER,"Stillness, fogged brakes, and fog on high."
3400,NOVEMBER,Only in me the waters cry
3401,NOVEMBER,"Who mourn the hours now slipped for ever,"
3402,NOVEMBER,"Hours of boding, joy, and fever,"
3403,NOVEMBER,"When we loved, by chance beguiled,"
3404,NOVEMBER,I a boy and you a child--
3405,NOVEMBER,"Child! but with an angel's air,"
3406,NOVEMBER,"Astonished, eager, unaware,"
3407,NOVEMBER,"Or elfin's, wandering with a grace"
3408,NOVEMBER,"Foreign to any fireside race,"
3409,NOVEMBER,And with a gaiety unknown
3410,NOVEMBER,"In the light feet and hair backblown,"
3411,NOVEMBER,"And with a sadness yet more strange,"
3412,NOVEMBER,In meagre cheeks which knew to change
3413,NOVEMBER,"Or faint or fired more swift than sight,"
3414,NOVEMBER,"And forlorn hands and lips pressed white,"
3415,NOVEMBER,"And fragile voice, and head downcast,"
3416,NOVEMBER,"Hiding tears, lifted at the last"
3417,NOVEMBER,To speed with one pale smile the wise
3418,NOVEMBER,Glance of the grey immortal eyes.
3419,NOVEMBER,
3420,NOVEMBER,How strange it was that we should dare
3421,NOVEMBER,Compound a miracle so rare
3422,NOVEMBER,"As, 'twixt this pace and Time's next pace,"
3423,NOVEMBER,Each to discern th' elected's face!
3424,NOVEMBER,"Yet stranger that the high sweet fire,"
3425,NOVEMBER,"In hearts nigh foreign to desire,"
3426,NOVEMBER,"Could burn, sigh, weep, and burn again"
3427,NOVEMBER,"As oh, it never has since then!"
3428,NOVEMBER,Most strange of all that we so young
3429,NOVEMBER,"Dared learn but would not speak love's tongue,"
3430,NOVEMBER,Love pledged but in the reveries
3431,NOVEMBER,Of our sad and dreaming eyes....
3432,NOVEMBER,
3433,NOVEMBER,"Now upon such journey bound me,"
3434,NOVEMBER,"Grief, disquiet, and stillness round me,"
3435,NOVEMBER,"As bids me where I cannot tell,"
3436,NOVEMBER,"Turn I and sigh, unseen, farewell."
3437,NOVEMBER,"Breathe the name as soft as mist,"
3438,NOVEMBER,"Lips, which nor kissed her nor were kissed!"
3439,NOVEMBER,"And again--a sigh, a death--"
3440,NOVEMBER,'Elizabeth. Elizabeth.'
3441,NOVEMBER,
3442,NOVEMBER,No voice answers; but the mist
3443,NOVEMBER,Glows for a moment amethyst
3444,NOVEMBER,"Ere the hid sun dissolves away,"
3445,NOVEMBER,"And dimness, growing dimmer grey,"
3446,NOVEMBER,Hides all ... till nothing can I see
3447,NOVEMBER,"But the blind walls enclosing me,"
3448,NOVEMBER,And no sound and no motion hear
3449,NOVEMBER,"But the vague water throbbing near,"
3450,NOVEMBER,Sole voice upon the darkening hill
3451,NOVEMBER,Where all is blank and dead and still.

3717,THE KELSO ROAD,
3718,THE KELSO ROAD,From Kelso town I took the road
3719,THE KELSO ROAD,By the full-flood Tweed;
3720,THE KELSO ROAD,The black clouds swept across the moon
3721,THE KELSO ROAD,With devouring greed.
3722,THE KELSO ROAD,
3723,THE KELSO ROAD,Seek ye no peace who tread the night;
3724,THE KELSO ROAD,I felt above my head

3726,THE KELSO ROAD,In pale fury spread.
3727,THE KELSO ROAD,
3728,THE KELSO ROAD,Twelve surly elves were digging graves
3729,THE KELSO ROAD,Beside black Eden brook;

3732,THE KELSO ROAD,
3733,THE KELSO ROAD,"In Birgham trees and hedges rocked,"

3736,THE KELSO ROAD,A fiend astride my back.
3737,THE KELSO ROAD,
3738,THE KELSO ROAD,"His legs he closed about my breast,"
3739,THE KELSO ROAD,"His hands upon my head,"
3740,THE KELSO ROAD,Till Coldstream lights beamed in the trees
3741,THE KELSO ROAD,And he wailed and fled.
3742,THE KELSO ROAD,
3743,THE KELSO ROAD,"Morning and evening are mine,"

3770,BALDON LANE,"I kept the roads until my bed,"

3775,BALDON LANE,"So back I came, to Baldon came,"

4096,BITTERNESS,(Knowing the while that they were very kind)
4097,BITTERNESS,"Remembrance clamoured in him: 'She was wild and free,"

4099,BITTERNESS,"To gain or loss, and, loving, loved but me,--but me!"
4100,BITTERNESS,

4105,BITTERNESS,
4106,BITTERNESS,"'Spoke reason to her, and she bowed her head,"
4107,BITTERNESS,"Having no argument, and giving up the strife."

4153,THE ROCK POOL,"Outward to ocean, as the slow tide falls,"
4154,THE ROCK POOL,Her sisters through the capes that hold the bay
4155,THE ROCK POOL,Dancing in lovely liberty recede.

4157,THE ROCK POOL,"Filled with soft colours, where the wavering weed"
4158,THE ROCK POOL,Moves gently and discloses to our eyes
4159,THE ROCK POOL,Blurred shining veins of rock and lucent shells
4160,THE ROCK POOL,Under the light-shot water; and here repose
4161,THE ROCK POOL,Small quiet fish and dimly glowing bells
4162,THE ROCK POOL,Of sleeping sea-anemones that close

4192,MEMORY,And hard bleak breath of the outward-looking will
4193,MEMORY,"Made barren her tender soil, when every voice"
4194,MEMORY,Of her million airy birds was muffled or still.
4195,MEMORY,

4203,MEMORY,"Some new thing touched our spirits with distant delight,"
4204,MEMORY,"Half-seen, half-noticed, as we loitered down,"
4205,MEMORY,"Talking in whispers, to the little town,"
4206,MEMORY,Down from the narrow hill
4207,MEMORY,"--Talking in whispers, for the air so still"
4208,MEMORY,"Imposed its stillness on our lips, and made"
4209,MEMORY,A quiet equal with the equal shade
4210,MEMORY,That filled the slanting walk. That phantom now
4211,MEMORY,Slides with slack canvas and unwhispering prow
4212,MEMORY,Through the dark sea that this dark room has made.
4213,MEMORY,
4214,MEMORY,"Or the night of the closed eyes will turn to day,"
4215,MEMORY,And all day's colours start out of the gray.
4216,MEMORY,The sun burns on the water. The tall hills
4217,MEMORY,"Push up their shady groves into the sky,"
4218,MEMORY,And fail and cease where the intense light spills
4219,MEMORY,Its parching torrent on the gaunt and dry
4220,MEMORY,"Rock of the further mountains, whence the snow"
4221,MEMORY,"That softened their harsh edges long is gone,"

4229,MEMORY,"As slow and soft as sleep,"
4230,MEMORY,"When shade grows pale and the cypress stands upright,"
4231,MEMORY,"Distinct in the cool light,"
4232,MEMORY,Rigid and solid as a dark hewn stone;
4233,MEMORY,"And many another night,"
4234,MEMORY,"That melts in darkness on the narrow quays,"
4235,MEMORY,"And changes every colour and every tone,"
4236,MEMORY,"And soothes the waters to a softer ease,"
4237,MEMORY,When under constellations coldly bright
4238,MEMORY,The homeward sailors sing their way to bed
4239,MEMORY,On ships that motionless in harbour float.
4240,MEMORY,The circling harbour-lights flash green and red;
4241,MEMORY,"And, out beyond, a steady travelling boat,"
4242,MEMORY,"Breaking the swell with slow industrious oars,"
4243,MEMORY,At each stroke pours
4244,MEMORY,Pale lighted water from the lifted blade.
4245,MEMORY,Now in the painted houses all around
4246,MEMORY,Slow-darkening windows call
4247,MEMORY,The empty unwatched middle of the night.
4248,MEMORY,The tide's few inches rise without a sound.
4249,MEMORY,"On the black promontory's windless head,"
4250,MEMORY,"The last awake, the fireflies rise and fall"
4251,MEMORY,And tangle up their dithering skeins of light.
4252,MEMORY,
4253,MEMORY,"O memory, take and keep"
4254,MEMORY,"All that my eyes, your servants, bring you home!"
4255,MEMORY,Thick through the changing year
4256,MEMORY,"The unexpected, rich-charged moments come,"
4257,MEMORY,That you twixt wake and sleep
4258,MEMORY,In the lids of the closed eyes shall make appear.
4259,MEMORY,
4260,MEMORY,"This is life's certain good,"
4261,MEMORY,Though in the end it be not good at all
4262,MEMORY,"When the dark end arises,"
4263,MEMORY,"And the stripped, startled spirit must let fall"
4264,MEMORY,The amulets that could
4265,MEMORY,Prevail with life's but not death's sad devices.
4266,MEMORY,
4267,MEMORY,"Then, like a child from whom an older child"
4268,MEMORY,"Forces its gathered treasures,"
4269,MEMORY,"Its beads and shells and strings of withered flowers,"
4270,MEMORY,"Tokens of recent pleasures,"
4271,MEMORY,The soul must lose in eyes weeping and wild
4272,MEMORY,Those prints of vanished hours.

4317,THE WIND,Snatch at the reins in my dead hands and push me
4318,THE WIND,"Out of my saddle, blow my labouring pony"

4320,THE WIND,"Nearer the heart from face and hands, and plant there,"

4442,ELEGY,"I hear you: yet more clear than all one note,"
4443,ELEGY,"One sudden hail I still remember best,"
4444,ELEGY,That came on sunny days from one afloat
4445,ELEGY,And drew me to the pane in certain quest
4446,ELEGY,"Of a long brown face, bare arms and flimsy vest,"
4447,ELEGY,"In fragments through the branches,"
4448,ELEGY,Above the green reflections:
4449,ELEGY,Paused by the willows in your varnished boat
4450,ELEGY,"You, with your oars at rest."
4451,ELEGY,
4452,ELEGY,Did that come back to you when you were dying?
4453,ELEGY,"I think it did: you had much leisure there,"
4454,ELEGY,"And, with the things we knew, came quietly flying"
4455,ELEGY,Memories of things you had seen we knew not where.
4456,ELEGY,
4457,ELEGY,You watched again with meditative stare
4458,ELEGY,"Places where you had wandered,"
4459,ELEGY,Golden and calm in distance:
4460,ELEGY,Voices from all your altering past came sighing
4461,ELEGY,On the soft Hampshire air.
4462,ELEGY,
4463,ELEGY,"For there you sat a hundred miles away,"
4464,ELEGY,"A rug upon your knees, your hands gone frail,"
4465,ELEGY,"And daily bade your farewell to the day,"
4466,ELEGY,A music blent of trees and clouds a-sail
4467,ELEGY,And figures in some old neglected tale:
4468,ELEGY,"And watched the sunset gathering,"
4469,ELEGY,"And heard the birdsong fading,"
4470,ELEGY,And went within when the last sleepy lay
4471,ELEGY,"Passed to a farther vale,"
4472,ELEGY,
4473,ELEGY,"Never complaining, and stepped up to bed"
4474,ELEGY,"More and more slow, a tall and sunburnt man"
4475,ELEGY,"Grown bony and bearded, knowing you would be dead"
4476,ELEGY,"Before the summer, glad your life began"
4477,ELEGY,"Even thus to end, after so short a span,"
4478,ELEGY,"And mused a space serenely,"
4479,ELEGY,"Then fell to easy slumber,"
4480,ELEGY,"At peace, content. For never again your head"
4481,ELEGY,Need make another plan.
4482,ELEGY,
4483,ELEGY,"Most generous, most gentle, most discreet,"
4484,ELEGY,Who left us ignorant to spare us pain:
4485,ELEGY,We went our ways with too forgetful feet
4486,ELEGY,"And missed the chance that would not come again,"
4487,ELEGY,"Leaving with thoughts on pleasure bent, or gain,"
4488,ELEGY,Fidelity unattested
4489,ELEGY,And services unrendered:
4490,ELEGY,"The ears are closed, the heart has ceased to beat,"
4491,ELEGY,And now all proof is vain.
4492,ELEGY,
4493,ELEGY,"Too late for other gifts, I give you this,"
4494,ELEGY,"Who took from you so much, so carelessly,"
4495,ELEGY,"On your far brows a first and phantom kiss,"
4496,ELEGY,On your far grave a careful elegy.
4497,ELEGY,"For one who loved all life and poetry,"
4498,ELEGY,"Sorrow in music bleeding,"
4499,ELEGY,And friendship's last confession.
4500,ELEGY,But even as I speak that inner hiss
4501,ELEGY,"Softly accuses me,"
4502,ELEGY,
4503,ELEGY,"Saying: Those brows are senseless, deaf that tomb,"
4504,ELEGY,"This is the callous, cold resort of art."
4505,ELEGY,'I give you this.' What do I give? to whom?
4506,ELEGY,"Words to the air, and balm to my own heart,"
4507,ELEGY,To its old luxurious and commanded smart.
4508,ELEGY,"An end to all this tuning,"
4509,ELEGY,This cynical masquerading;
4510,ELEGY,What comfort now in that far final gloom
4511,ELEGY,Can any song impart?
4512,ELEGY,
4513,ELEGY,"O yet I see you dawning from some heaven,"
4514,ELEGY,Who would not suffer self-reproach to live
4515,ELEGY,In one to whom your friendship once was given.
4516,ELEGY,"I catch a vision, faint and fugitive,"
4517,ELEGY,"Of a dark face with eyes contemplative,"
4518,ELEGY,"Deep eyes that smile in silence,"
4519,ELEGY,"And parted lips that whisper,"

4601,SEASCAPE,"Over that morn hung heaviness, until,"
4602,SEASCAPE,"Near sunless noon, we heard the ship's bell beating"
4603,SEASCAPE,A melancholy staccato on dead metal;
4604,SEASCAPE,Saw the bare-footed watch come running aft;
4605,SEASCAPE,"Felt, far below, the sudden telegraph jangle"
4606,SEASCAPE,"Its harsh metallic challenge, thrice repeated:"
4607,SEASCAPE,'Stand to. Half-speed ahead. Slow. Stop her!'
4608,SEASCAPE,They stopped.
4609,SEASCAPE,The plunging pistons sank like a stopped heart:
4610,SEASCAPE,"She held, she swayed, a hulk, a hollow carcass"
4611,SEASCAPE,"Of blistered iron that the grey-green, waveless,"
4612,SEASCAPE,Unruffled tropic waters slapped languidly.
4613,SEASCAPE,
4614,SEASCAPE,"And, in that pause, a sinister whisper ran:"
4615,SEASCAPE,Burial at Sea! a Portuguese official ...
4616,SEASCAPE,Poor fever-broken devil from Mozambique:
4617,SEASCAPE,Came on half tight: the doctor calls it heat-stroke.
4618,SEASCAPE,Why do they travel steerage? It's the exchange:
4619,SEASCAPE,So many million 'reis' to the pound!
4620,SEASCAPE,What did he look like? No one ever saw him:
4621,SEASCAPE,"Took to his bunk, and drank and drank and died."
4622,SEASCAPE,They're ready! Silence!
4623,SEASCAPE,"We clustered to the rail,"
4624,SEASCAPE,Curious and half-ashamed. The well-deck spread
4625,SEASCAPE,A comfortable gulf of segregation
4626,SEASCAPE,Between ourselves and death. 'Burial at sea' ...
4627,SEASCAPE,The master holds a black book at arm's length;
4628,SEASCAPE,His droning voice comes for'ard: 'This our brother ...
4629,SEASCAPE,We therefore commit his body to the deep
4630,SEASCAPE,To be turned into corruption' ... The bo's'n whispers
4631,SEASCAPE,"Hoarsely behind his hand: 'Now, all together!'"
4632,SEASCAPE,The hatch-cover is tilted; a mummy of sailcloth
4633,SEASCAPE,Well ballasted with iron shoots clear of the poop;
4634,SEASCAPE,"Falls, like a diving gannet. The green sea closes"
4635,SEASCAPE,Its burnished skin; the snaky swell smoothes over ...
4636,SEASCAPE,"While he, the man of the steerage, goes down, down,"
4637,SEASCAPE,"Feet foremost, sliding swiftly down the dim water,"
4638,SEASCAPE,Swift to escape
4639,SEASCAPE,"Those plunging shapes with pale, empurpled bellies"
4640,SEASCAPE,That swirl and veer about him. He goes down
4641,SEASCAPE,"Unerringly, as though he knew the way"
4642,SEASCAPE,"Through green, through gloom, to absolute watery darkness,"
4643,SEASCAPE,Where no weed sways nor curious fin quivers:
4644,SEASCAPE,"To the sad, sunless deeps where, endlessly,"
4645,SEASCAPE,A downward drift of death spreads its wan mantle
4646,SEASCAPE,In the wave-moulded valleys that shall enfold him
4647,SEASCAPE,Till the sea give up its dead.
4648,SEASCAPE,
4649,SEASCAPE,There shall he lie dispersed amid great riches:
4650,SEASCAPE,"Such gold, such arrogance, so many bold hearts!"
4651,SEASCAPE,All the sunken armadas pressed to powder
4652,SEASCAPE,By weight of incredible seas! That mingled wrack
4653,SEASCAPE,No livening sun shall visit till the crust
4654,SEASCAPE,"Of earth be riven, or this rolling planet"
4655,SEASCAPE,"Reel on its axis; till the moon-chained tides,"
4656,SEASCAPE,"Unloosed, deliver up that white Atlantis"
4657,SEASCAPE,Whose naked peaks shall bleach above the slaked
4658,SEASCAPE,"Thirst of Sahara, fringed by weedy tangles"
4659,SEASCAPE,"Of Atlas's drown'd cedars, frowning eastward"
4660,SEASCAPE,"To where the sands of India lie cold,"
4661,SEASCAPE,And heap'd Himalaya's a rib of coral
4662,SEASCAPE,"Slowly uplifted, grain on grain...."
4663,SEASCAPE,
4664,SEASCAPE,We dream
4665,SEASCAPE,Too long! Another jangle of alarum
4666,SEASCAPE,Stabs at the engines: 'Slow. Half-speed. Full-speed!'
4667,SEASCAPE,"The great bearings rumble; the screw churns, frothing"
4668,SEASCAPE,Opaque water to downward-swelling plumes
4669,SEASCAPE,Milky as wood-smoke. A shoal of flying-fish
4670,SEASCAPE,Spurts out like animate spray. The warm breeze wakens;
4671,SEASCAPE,"And we pass on, forgetting,"
4672,SEASCAPE,Toward the solemn horizon of bronzed cumulus
4673,SEASCAPE,"That bounds our brooding sea, gathering gloom"
4674,SEASCAPE,"That, when night falls, will dissipate in flaws"
4675,SEASCAPE,"Of watery lightning, washing the hot sky,"
4676,SEASCAPE,"Cleansing all hearts of heat and restlessness,"
4677,SEASCAPE,"Until, with day, another blue be born."

4684,SCIROCCO,"Where the sick, wind-harassed sun"
4685,SCIROCCO,In the whiteness of the day
4686,SCIROCCO,Ghostly shone and stole away--
4687,SCIROCCO,Parchèd with the utter thirst
4688,SCIROCCO,"Of unnumbered Libyan sands,"
4689,SCIROCCO,"Thou, cloud-gathering spirit, burst"
4690,SCIROCCO,Out of arid Africa
4691,SCIROCCO,"To the tideless sea, and smote"
4692,SCIROCCO,"On our pale, moon-coolèd lands"
4693,SCIROCCO,The hot breath of a lion's throat.
4694,SCIROCCO,
4695,SCIROCCO,And that furnace-heated breath
4696,SCIROCCO,Blew into my placid dreams
4697,SCIROCCO,The heart of fire from whence it came:
4698,SCIROCCO,Haunt of beauty and of death
4699,SCIROCCO,Where the forest breaks in flame
4700,SCIROCCO,"Of flaunting blossom, where the flood"
4701,SCIROCCO,"Of life pulses hot and stark,"
4702,SCIROCCO,Where a wing'd death breeds in mud
4703,SCIROCCO,And tumult of tree-shadowed streams--
4704,SCIROCCO,"Black waters, desolately hurled"
4705,SCIROCCO,"Through the uttermost, lost, dark,"
4706,SCIROCCO,Secret places of the world.
4707,SCIROCCO,
4708,SCIROCCO,"There, O swift and terrible"
4709,SCIROCCO,"Being, wast thou born; and thence,"
4710,SCIROCCO,"Like a demon loosed from hell,"
4711,SCIROCCO,Stripped with rending wings the dense
4712,SCIROCCO,"Echoing forests, till their bowed"
4713,SCIROCCO,Plumes of trees like tattered cloud
4714,SCIROCCO,"Were toss'd and torn, and cried aloud"
4715,SCIROCCO,As the wood were rack'd with pain:
4716,SCIROCCO,"Thence thou freed'st thy wings, and soon"
4717,SCIROCCO,"From the moaning, stricken plain"
4718,SCIROCCO,In whorled eagle-soarings rose
4719,SCIROCCO,To melt the sun-defeating snows
4720,SCIROCCO,"Of the Mountains of the Moon,"
4721,SCIROCCO,"To dull their glaciers with fierce breath,"
4722,SCIROCCO,"To slip the avalanches' rein,"
4723,SCIROCCO,To set the laughing torrents free
4724,SCIROCCO,"On the tented desert beneath,"
4725,SCIROCCO,Where men of thirst must wither and die
4726,SCIROCCO,While the vultures stare in the sun's eye;
4727,SCIROCCO,Where slowly sifting sands are strown
4728,SCIROCCO,"On broken cities, whose bleaching bones"
4729,SCIROCCO,Whiten in moonlight stone on stone.
4730,SCIROCCO,
4731,SCIROCCO,Over their pitiful dust thy blast
4732,SCIROCCO,"Passed in columns of whirling sand,"
4733,SCIROCCO,Leapt the desert and swept the strand
4734,SCIROCCO,"Of the cool and quiet sea,"
4735,SCIROCCO,"Gathering mighty shapes, and proud"
4736,SCIROCCO,"Phantoms of monstrous, wave-born cloud,"
4737,SCIROCCO,And northward drove this panoply
4738,SCIROCCO,Till the sky seemed charging on the land....
4739,SCIROCCO,
4740,SCIROCCO,"Yet, in that plumèd helm, the most"
4741,SCIROCCO,"Of thy hot power was cooled or lost,"
4742,SCIROCCO,"So that it came to me at length,"
4743,SCIROCCO,"Faint and tepid and shorn of strength,"
4744,SCIROCCO,To shiver an olive-grove that heaves
4745,SCIROCCO,"A myriad moonlight-coloured leaves,"
4746,SCIROCCO,And in the stone-pine's dome set free
4747,SCIROCCO,A murmur of the middle sea:
4748,SCIROCCO,A puff of warm air in the night
4749,SCIROCCO,So spent by its impetuous flight
4750,SCIROCCO,"It scarce invades my pillar'd closes,--"
4751,SCIROCCO,To waft their fragrance from the sweet
4752,SCIROCCO,Buds of my lemon-coloured roses
4753,SCIROCCO,Or strew blown petals at my feet:
4754,SCIROCCO,To kiss my cheek with a warm sigh
4755,SCIROCCO,And in the tired darkness die.

4760,THE QUAILS,
4761,THE QUAILS,(In the south of Italy the peasants put out the eyes of a captured quail
4762,THE QUAILS,so that its cries may attract the flocks of spring migrants into their
4763,THE QUAILS,nets.)
4764,THE QUAILS,
4765,THE QUAILS,
4766,THE QUAILS,All through the night
4767,THE QUAILS,"I have heard the stuttering call of a blind quail,"
4768,THE QUAILS,"A caged decoy, under a cairn of stones,"
4769,THE QUAILS,Crying for light as the quails cry for love.
4770,THE QUAILS,
4771,THE QUAILS,"Other wanderers,"
4772,THE QUAILS,"Northward from Africa winging on numb pinions, dazed"
4773,THE QUAILS,"With beating winds and the sobbing of the sea,"
4774,THE QUAILS,"Hear, in a breath of sweet land-herbage, the call"
4775,THE QUAILS,"Of the blind one, their sister...."
4776,THE QUAILS,"Hearing, their fluttered hearts"
4777,THE QUAILS,"Take courage, and they wheel in their dark flight,"
4778,THE QUAILS,"Knowing that their toil is over, dreaming to see"
4779,THE QUAILS,"The white stubbles of Abruzzi smitten with dawn,"
4780,THE QUAILS,"And spilt grain lying in the furrows, the squandered gold"
4781,THE QUAILS,That is the delight of quails in their spring mating.
4782,THE QUAILS,
4783,THE QUAILS,"Land-scents grow keener,"
4784,THE QUAILS,Penetrating the dank and bitter odour of brine
4785,THE QUAILS,That whitens their feathers;
4786,THE QUAILS,"Far below, the voice of their sister calls them"
4787,THE QUAILS,"To plenty, and sweet water, and fulfilment."
4788,THE QUAILS,"Over the pallid margin of dim seas breaking,"
4789,THE QUAILS,"Over the thickening in the darkness that is land,"
4790,THE QUAILS,They fly. Their flight is ended. Wings beat no more.
4791,THE QUAILS,"Downward they drift, one by one, like dark petals,"
4792,THE QUAILS,"Slowly, listlessly falling"
4793,THE QUAILS,Into the mouth of horror:
4794,THE QUAILS,The nets....
4795,THE QUAILS,
4796,THE QUAILS,"Where men come trampling and crying with bright lanterns,"
4797,THE QUAILS,"Plucking their weak, entangled claws from the meshes of net,"
4798,THE QUAILS,"Clutching the soft brown bodies mottled with olive,"
4799,THE QUAILS,"Crushing the warm, fluttering flesh, in hands stained with blood,"
4800,THE QUAILS,"Till their quivering hearts are stilled, and the bright eyes,"
4801,THE QUAILS,"That are like a polished agate, glaze in death."
4802,THE QUAILS,
4803,THE QUAILS,"But the blind one, in her wicker cage, without ceasing"
4804,THE QUAILS,"Haunts this night of spring with her stuttering call,"
4805,THE QUAILS,"Knowing nothing of the terror that walks in darkness,"
4806,THE QUAILS,Knowing only that some cruelty has stolen the light
4807,THE QUAILS,"That is life, and that she must cry until she dies."
4808,THE QUAILS,
4809,THE QUAILS,"I, in the darkness,"
4810,THE QUAILS,"Heard, and my heart grew sick. But I know that to-morrow"
4811,THE QUAILS,A smiling peasant will come with a basket of quails
4812,THE QUAILS,"Wrapped in vine-leaves, prodding them with blood-stained fingers,"
4813,THE QUAILS,"Saying, 'Signore, you must cook them thus, and thus,"
4814,THE QUAILS,"With a sprig of basil inside them.' And I shall thank him,"
4815,THE QUAILS,Carrying the piteous carcases into the kitchen
4816,THE QUAILS,"Without a pang, without shame."
4817,THE QUAILS,
4818,THE QUAILS,'Why should I be ashamed? Why should I rail
4819,THE QUAILS,"Against the cruelty of men? Why should I pity,"
4820,THE QUAILS,Seeing that there is no cruelty which men can imagine
4821,THE QUAILS,To match the subtle dooms that are wrought against them
4822,THE QUAILS,"By blind spores of pestilence: seeing that each of us,"
4823,THE QUAILS,"Lured by dim hopes, flutters in the toils of death"
4824,THE QUAILS,On a cold star that is spinning blindly through space
4825,THE QUAILS,Into the nets of time?'
4826,THE QUAILS,
4827,THE QUAILS,"So cried I, bitterly thrusting pity aside,"
4828,THE QUAILS,"Closing my lids to sleep. But sleep came not,"
4829,THE QUAILS,"And pity, with sad eyes,"
4830,THE QUAILS,"Crept to my side, and told me"
4831,THE QUAILS,That the life of all creatures is brave and pityful
4832,THE QUAILS,"Whether they be men, with dark thoughts to vex them,"
4833,THE QUAILS,"Or birds, wheeling in the swift joys of flight,"
4834,THE QUAILS,"Or brittle ephemerids, spinning to death in the haze"
4835,THE QUAILS,Of gold that quivers on dim evening waters;
4836,THE QUAILS,Nor would she be denied.
4837,THE QUAILS,The harshness died
4838,THE QUAILS,"Within me, and my heart"
4839,THE QUAILS,Was caught and fluttered like the palpitant heart
4840,THE QUAILS,"Of a brown quail, flying"
4841,THE QUAILS,"To the call of her blind sister,"
4842,THE QUAILS,"And death, in the spring night."
