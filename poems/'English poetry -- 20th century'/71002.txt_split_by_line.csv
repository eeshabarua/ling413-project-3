158,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
159,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
160,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,It is narrated (and God knows best the true state of the case) by Abu
161,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Ali Jafir Bin Yakub-ulisfahani that when, in His determinate Will,"
162,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"The Benefactor had decided to create the Greatest Substitute (Adam),"
163,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"He despatched, as is known, the faithful and the excellent Archangel"
164,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Jibrail to gather from Earth clays, loams, and sands endowed with"
165,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"various colours and attributes, necessary for the substance of our"
166,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"pure Forefather’s body. Receiving the Command and reaching the place,"
167,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Jibrail put forth his hand to take them, but Earth shook and lamented"
168,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"and supplicated him. Then said Jibrail: “Lie still and rejoice, for"
169,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,out of thee He will create that than which (there) is no handsomer
170,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,thing--to wit a Successor and a Wearer of the Diadem over thee through
171,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"the ages.” Earth said: “I adjure thee to abstain from thy purpose, lest"
172,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,evil and condemnation of that person who is created out of me should
173,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"later overtake him, and the Abiding (sorrow) be loosed upon my head. I"
174,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"have no power to resist the Will of the Most High, but I take refuge"
175,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,with Allah from thee.” So Jibrail was moved by the lamentations and
176,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"helplessness of Earth, and returned to the Vestibule of the Glory with"
177,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,an empty hand.
178,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
179,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"After this, by the Permission, the Just and Terrible Archangel Michael"
180,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"next descended, and he, likewise, hearing and seeing the abjection of"
181,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Earth, returned with an empty hand. Then was sent the Archangel Azrael,"
182,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"and when Earth had once again implored God, and once again cried out,"
183,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,he closed his hand upon her bosom and tore out the clays and sands
184,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,necessary.
185,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
186,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Upon his return to the Vestibule it was asked if Earth had again taken
187,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,refuge with Allah or not? Azrael said: “Yes.” It was answered: “If
188,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,it took refuge with Me why didst thou not spare?” Azrael answered:
189,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,“Obedience (to Thee) was more obligatory than Pity (for it).” It was
190,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,answered: “Depart! I have made thee the Angel of Death to separate the
191,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"souls from the bodies of men.” Azrael wept, saying: “Thus shall all"
192,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,men hate me.” It was answered: “Thou hast said that Obedience is more
193,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,obligatory than Pity. Mix thou the clays and the sands and lay them
194,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"to dry between Tayif and Mecca till the time appointed.” So, then,"
195,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Azrael departed and did according to the Command. But in his haste
196,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,he perceived not that he had torn out from Earth clays and minerals
197,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,that had lain in her at war with each other since the first; nor did
198,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,he withdraw them and set them aside. And in his grief that he should
199,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"have been decreed the Separator of Companions, his tears mingled with"
200,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,them in the mixing so that the substance of Adam’s body was made
201,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"unconformable and ill-assorted, pierced with burning drops, and at"
202,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,issue with itself before there was (cause of) strife.
203,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
204,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"This, then, lay out to dry for forty years between Tayif and Mecca"
205,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"and, through all that time, the Beneficence of the Almighty leavened"
206,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"it and rained upon it the Mercy and the Blessing, and the properties"
207,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"necessary to the adornment of the Successorship. In that period, too,"
208,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"it is narrated that the Angels passed to and fro above it, and among"
209,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"them Eblis the Accursed, who smote the predestined Creation while it"
210,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"was drying, and it rang hollow. Eblis then looked more closely and"
211,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,observing that of which it was composed to be diverse and ill-assorted
212,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"and impregnated with bitter tears, he said: “Doubt not I shall soon"
213,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"attain authority over this; and his ruin shall be easy.” (This, too,"
214,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,lay in the foreknowledge of The Endless.)
215,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
216,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,When time was that the chain of cause and effect should be surrendered
217,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"to Man’s will, and the vessels of desire and intention entrusted to"
218,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"his intelligence, and the tent of his body illuminated by the lamp of"
219,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"vitality, the Soul was despatched, by Command of the Almighty, with"
220,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"the Archangel Jibrail, towards that body. But the Soul being thin and"
221,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"subtle refused, at first, to enter the thick and diverse clays, saying:"
222,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"“I have fear of that (which is) to be.” This it cried twice, till it"
223,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"received the Word: “_Enter unwillingly, and unwillingly depart._” Then"
224,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"only it entered. And when that agony was accomplished, the Word came:"
225,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,“_My Compassion exceedeth My Wrath._” It is narrated that these were
226,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,the first words of which our pure Forefather had cognisance.
227,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
228,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Afterwards, by the operation of the determinate Will, there arose in"
229,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Adam a desire for a companion, and an intimate and a friend in the"
230,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Garden of the Tree. It is narrated that he first took counsel of Earth
231,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,(which had furnished) his body. Earth said: “Forbear. Is it not enough
232,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,that one should have dominion over me?” Adam answered: “There is but
233,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,one who is One in Earth or Heaven. All paired things point to the
234,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Unity, and my soul, which came not from thee, desires unutterably.”"
235,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Earth said: “Be content in innocence, and let thy body, which I"
236,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"gave unwillingly, return thus to (me) thy mother.” Adam said: “I am"
237,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,motherless. What should I know?”
238,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
239,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,At that time came Eblis the Accursed who had long prepared an evil
240,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"stratagem and a hateful device against our pure Forefather, being"
241,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"desirous of his damnation, and anxious to multiply causes and occasions"
242,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,thereto. He addressed first his detestable words to the Peacock among
243,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"the birds of the Garden, saying: “I have great amity towards thee"
244,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"because of thy beauty; but, through no fault of mine, I am forbidden"
245,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"the Garden. Hide me, then, among thy tail-feathers that I may enter it,"
246,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"and worship both thee and our Lord Adam, who is Master of thee.” The"
247,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Peacock said: “Not by any contrivance of mine shalt thou enter, lest"
248,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,a judgment fall on my beauty and my excellence. But there is in the
249,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Garden a Serpent of loathsome aspect who shall make thy path easy.”
250,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,He then despatched the Serpent to the Gate and after conversation and
251,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"by contrivance and a malign artifice, Eblis hid himself under the"
252,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"tongue of the Serpent, and was thus conveyed past the barrier. He then"
253,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,worshipped Adam and ceased not to counsel him to demand a companion and
254,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"an intimate that the delights might be increased, and the succession"
255,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"assured to the Regency of Earth. For he foresaw that, among multitudes,"
256,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,many should come to him. Adam therefore made daily supplication
257,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,for that blessing. It was answered him: “How knowest thou if the
258,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,gratification of thy desire be a blessing or a curse?” Adam said: “By
259,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,no means; but I will abide the chance.”
260,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
261,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Then the somnolence fell upon him, as is narrated; and upon waking he"
262,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,beheld our Lady Eve (upon whom be the Mercy and the Forgiveness). Adam
263,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"said: “O my Lady and Light of my Universe, who art thou?” Eve said: “O"
264,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"my Lord and Summit of my Contentment, who art thou?” Adam said: “Of"
265,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,a surety I am thine.” Eve said: “Of a surety I am thine.” Thus they
266,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"ceased to inquire further into the matter, but were united, and became"
267,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"one flesh and one soul, and their felicity was beyond comparison or"
268,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,belief or imagination or apprehension.
269,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
270,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Thereafter, it is narrated, that Eblis the Stoned consorted with them"
271,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"secretly in the Garden, and the Peacock with him; and they jested"
272,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,and made mirth for our Lord Adam and his Lady Eve and propounded
273,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,riddles and devised occasions for the stringing of the ornaments and
274,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,the threading of subtleties. And upon a time when their felicity was
275,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"at its height, and their happiness excessive, and their contentment"
276,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"expanded to the uttermost, Eblis said: “O my Master and my Mistress"
277,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"declare to us, if it pleases, some comparison or similitude that lies"
278,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,beyond the limits of possibility.” Adam said: “This is easy. That the
279,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Sun should cease in Heaven or that the Rivers should dry in the Garden
280,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"is beyond the limits of possibility.” And they laughed and agreed,"
281,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"and the Peacock said: “O our Lady, tell us now something of a jest"
282,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,as unconceivable and as beyond belief as this saying of thy Lord.”
283,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Our Lady Eve then said: “That my Lord should look upon me otherwise
284,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,than is his custom is beyond this saying.” And when they had laughed
285,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"abundantly, she said: “O our Servitors, tell us now something that is"
286,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,further from possibility or belief than my saying.” Then the Peacock
287,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"said: “O our Lady Eve, except that thou shouldst look upon thy Lord"
288,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"otherwise than is thy custom, there is nothing further than thy saying"
289,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,from possibility or belief or imagination.” Then said Eblis: “Except
290,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"that the one of you should be made an enemy to the other, there is"
291,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"nothing, O my Lady, further than thy saying from possibility, or"
292,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"belief, or imagination, or apprehension.” And they laughed immoderately"
293,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,all four together in the Garden.
294,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
295,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"But when the Peacock had gone and Eblis had seemed to depart, our Lady"
296,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Eve said to Adam: “My Lord and Disposer of my Soul, by what means did"
297,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Eblis know our fear?” Adam said: “O my Lady, what fear?” Eve said: “The"
298,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"fear which was in our hearts from the first, that the one of us might"
299,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,be made an enemy to the other.” Then our pure Forefather bowed his head
300,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"on her bosom and said: “O Companion of my Heart, this has been my fear"
301,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"also from the first, but how didst thou know?” Eve said: “Because I am"
302,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,thy flesh and thy soul. What shall we do?”
303,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
304,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Thus, then, they came at moonrise to the Tree that had been forbidden"
305,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"to them, and Eblis lay asleep under it. But he waked merrily and said:"
306,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"“O my Master and my Mistress, this is the Tree of Eternity. By eating"
307,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"her fruit, felicity is established for ever among mankind; nor after"
308,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,eating it shall there be any change whatever in the disposition of the
309,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,hearts of the eaters.”
310,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
311,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Eve then put out her hand to the fruit, but Adam said: “It is"
312,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"forbidden. Let us go.” Eve said: “O my Lord and my Sustainer, upon my"
313,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"head be it, and upon the heads of my daughters after me. I will first"
314,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"taste of this Tree, and if misfortune fall on me, do thou intercede"
315,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"for me; or else eat likewise, so that eternal bliss may come to us"
316,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,together.”
317,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
318,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Thus she ate, and he after her; and at once the ornaments of Paradise"
319,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"disappeared from round them, and they were delivered to shame and"
320,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"nudity and abjection. Then, as is narrated, Adam accused Eve in the"
321,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Presence; but our Lady Eve (upon whom be the Pity and the Recompense)
322,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,accepted (the blame of) all that had been done.
323,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
324,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,When the Serpent and the Peacock had each received their portion for
325,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,their evil contrivances (for the punishment of Eblis was reserved) the
326,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Divine Decree of Expulsion was laid upon Adam and Eve in these words:
327,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"“_Get ye down, the one of you an enemy to the other._” Adam said: “But"
328,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,I have heard that Thy Compassion exceeds Thy Wrath.” It was answered:
329,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,“I have spoken. The Decree shall stand in the place of all curses.” So
330,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"they went down, and the barriers of the Garden of the Tree were made"
331,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,fast behind them.
332,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
333,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,It is further recorded by the stringers of the pearls of words and the
334,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"narrators of old, that when our pure Forefather the Lord Adam and his"
335,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,adorable consort Eve (upon whom be the Glory and the Sacrifice) were
336,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"thus expelled, there was lamentation among the beasts in the Garden"
337,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,whom Adam had cherished and whom our Lady Eve had comforted. Of those
338,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"unaffected there remained only the Mole, whose custom it was to burrow"
339,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,in earth and to avoid the light of the Sun. His nature was malignant
340,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"and his body inconspicuous but, by the Power of the Omnipotent, Whose"
341,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Name be exalted, he was then adorned with eyes far-seeing both in the"
342,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,light and the darkness.
343,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
344,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"When the Mole heard the Divine Command of Expulsion, it entered his"
345,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,impure mind that he would extract profit and advancement from a secret
346,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,observation and a hidden espial. So he followed our Forefather and
347,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"his august consort, under the earth, and watched those two in their"
348,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"affliction and their abjection and their misery, and the Garden was"
349,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,without his presence for that time.
350,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
351,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"When his watch was complete and his observation certain, he turned him"
352,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,swiftly underneath the Earth and came back saying to the Guardians of
353,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,the Gate: “Make room! I have a sure and a terrible report.” So his
354,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"passage was permitted, and he lay till evening in the Garden. Then"
355,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,he said: “Can the Accursed by any means escape the Decree?” It was
356,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,answered: “By no means can they escape or avoid.” Then the Mole said:
357,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,“But I have seen that they have escaped.” It was answered: “Declare
358,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,thy observation.” The Mole said: “The enemies to each other have
359,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,altogether departed from Thy worship and Thy adoration. Nor are they
360,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"in any sort enemies to each other, for they enjoy together the most"
361,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"perfect felicity, and moreover they have made them a new God.” It was"
362,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,answered: “Declare the shape of the God.” The Mole said: “Their God is
363,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"of small stature, pinkish in colour, unclothed, fat and smiling. They"
364,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"lay it upon the grass and, filling its hands with flowers, worship it"
365,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,and desire no greater comfort.” It was answered: “Declare the name of
366,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"the God.” The Mole said: “Its name is Quabil (Cain), and I testify upon"
367,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,a sure observation that it is their God and their Uniter and their
368,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Comforter.” It was answered: “Why hast thou come to Us?” The Mole said:
369,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,“Through my zeal and my diligence; for honour and in hope of reward.”
370,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"It was answered: “Is this, then, the best that thou canst do with"
371,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,the eyes which We gave thee?” The Mole said: “To the extreme of my
372,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,ability!” It was answered: “There is no need. Thou hast not added to
373,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"their burden, but to thine own. Be darkened henceforward, upon Earth"
374,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,and under Earth. It is not good to spy upon any creature of God to whom
375,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"alleviation is permitted.” So, then, the Mole’s eyes were darkened and"
376,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"contracted, and his lot was made miserable upon and under the Earth to"
377,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,this day.
378,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
379,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"But to those two, Adam and Eve, the alleviation was permitted, till"
380,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Habil and Quabil and their sisters Labuda and Aqlemia had attained
381,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,the age of maturity. Then there came to the Greatest Substitute and
382,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"his Consort, from out of Kabul the Stony, that Peacock, by whose"
383,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,contrivance Eblis the Accursed had first obtained admission into the
384,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Garden of the Tree. And they made him welcome in all their ways and
385,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,into all their imaginings; and he sustained them with false words and
386,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"flagitious counsels, so that they considered and remembered their"
387,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,forfeited delights in the Garden both arrogantly and impenitently.
388,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
389,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Then came the Word to the Archangel Jibrail the Faithful, saying:"
390,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"“Follow those two with diligence, and interpose the shield of thy"
391,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,benevolence where it shall be necessary; for though We have surrendered
392,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,them for awhile (to Eblis) they shall not achieve an irremediable
393,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,destruction.” Jibrail therefore followed our First Substitute and the
394,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Lady Eve--upon whom is the Grace and a Forgetfulness--and kept watch
395,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,upon them in all the lands appointed for their passage through the
396,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,world. Nor did he hear any lamentations in their mouths for their sins.
397,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"It is recorded that, for a hundred years they were continuously upheld"
398,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"by the Peacock under the detestable power of Eblis the Stoned, who by"
399,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,means of magic multiplied the similitudes of meat and drink and rich
400,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"raiment about them for their pleasure, and came daily to worship them"
401,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,as Gods. (This also lay in the predestined Will of the Inscrutable).
402,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Further, in that age, their eyes were darkened and their minds were"
403,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"made turbid, and the faculty of laughter was removed from them. The"
404,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Excellent Archangel Jibrail, when he perceived by observation that they"
405,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"had ceased to laugh, returned and bowed himself among the Servitors and"
406,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,cried: “The last evil has fallen upon Thy creatures whom I guard! They
407,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,have ceased to laugh and are made even with the ox and the camel.” It
408,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,was answered: “This also was foreseen. Keep watch.”
409,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
410,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"After yet another hundred years Eblis, whose doom is assured, came to"
411,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,worship Adam as was his custom and said: “O my Lord and my Advancer
412,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"and my Preceptor in Good and Evil, whom hast thou ever beheld in all"
413,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"thy world, wiser and more excellent than thyself?” Adam said: “I have"
414,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,never seen such an one.” Eblis asked: “Hast thou ever conceived of
415,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,such an one?” Adam answered: “Except in dreams I have never conceived
416,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,of such an one.” Eblis then answered: “Disregard dreams. They proceed
417,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,from superfluity of meat. Stretch out thy hand upon the world which
418,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,thou hast made and take possession.” So Adam took possession of the
419,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,mountains which he had levelled and of the rivers which he had diverted
420,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,and of the upper and lower Fires which he had made to speak and to work
421,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"for him, and he named them as possessions for himself and his children"
422,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"for ever. After this, Eblis asked: “O, my Upholder and Crown of my"
423,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Belief, who has given thee these profitable things?” Adam said: “By my"
424,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Hand and my Head, I alone have given myself these things.” Eblis said:"
425,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"“Praise we the Giver!” So, then, Adam praised himself in a loud voice,"
426,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,and built an Altar and a Mirror behind the Altar; and he ceased not
427,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"to adore himself in the Mirror, and to extol himself daily before the"
428,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Altar, by the name and under the attributes of the Almighty."
429,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
430,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,The historians assert that on such occasions it was the custom of the
431,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Peacock to expand his tail and stand beside our First Substitute and to
432,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,minister to him with flatteries and adorations.
433,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
434,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"After yet another hundred years, the Omnipotent Whose Name be exalted,"
435,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"put a bitter remorse into the bosom of the Peacock, and that bird"
436,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,closed his tail and wept upon the mountains of Serendib. Then said
437,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,the Excellent and Faithful Archangel Jibrail: “How has the Vengeance
438,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"overtaken thee, O thou least desirable of fowl?” The Peacock said:"
439,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,“Though I myself would by no means consent to convey Eblis into the
440,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Garden of the Tree, yet as is known to thee and to the All Seeing, I"
441,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"referred him to the Serpent for a subtle device, by whose malice and"
442,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,beneath whose tongue did Eblis secretly enter that Garden. Wherefore
443,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,did Allah change my attuned voice to a harsh cry and my beauteous
444,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"legs to unseemly legs, and hurled me into the district of Kabul the"
445,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Stony. Now I fear that He will also deprive me of my tail, which is"
446,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,the ornament of my days and the delight of my eye. For that cause and
447,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"in that fear I am penitent, O Servant of God.” Jibrail then said:"
448,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"“Penitence lies not in confession, but in restitution and visible"
449,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,amendment.” The Peacock said: “Enlighten me in that path and prove
450,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"my sincerity.” Jibrail said: “I am troubled on account of Adam who,"
451,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"through the impure magic of Eblis, has departed from humility, and"
452,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"worships himself daily at an Altar and before a Mirror, in such and"
453,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"such a manner.” The Peacock said: “O Courier of the Thrones, hast thou"
454,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,taken counsel of the Lady Eve?” Jibrail asked: “For what reason?” The
455,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Peacock said: “For the reason that when the Decree of Expulsion was
456,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"issued against those two, it was said: ‘_Get ye down, the one of you"
457,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"an enemy unto the other_,’ and this is a sure word.” Jibrail answered:"
458,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,“What will that profit?” The Peacock said: “Let us exchange our shapes
459,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,for a time and I will show thee that profit.”
460,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
461,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Jibrail then exacted an oath from the Peacock that he would return
462,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,him his shape at the expiration of a certain time without dishonour
463,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"or fraud, and the exchange was effected, and Jibrail retired himself"
464,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"into the shape of the Peacock, and the Peacock lifted himself into"
465,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,the illustrious similitude of Jibrail and came to our Lady Eve and
466,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,said: “Who is God?” The Lady Eve answered him: “His name is Adam.” The
467,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Peacock said: “How is he God?” The Lady Eve answered: “For that he
468,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,knows both Good and Evil.” The Peacock asked: “By what means attained
469,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,he to that knowledge?” The Lady Eve answered: “Of a truth it was I
470,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,who brought it to him between my hands from off a Tree in the Garden.”
471,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"The Peacock said: “The greater then thy modesty and thy meekness, O my"
472,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Lady Eve,” and he removed himself from her presence, and came again"
473,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,to Jibrail a little before the time of the evening prayer. He said to
474,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"that excellent and trusty one: “Continue, I pray, to serve in my shape"
475,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,at the time of the Worship at the Altar.” So Jibrail consented and
476,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"preened himself and spread his tail and pecked between his claws, after"
477,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"the manner of created Peacocks, before the Altar until the entrance"
478,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,of our pure Forefather and his august consort. Then he perceived by
479,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,observation that when Adam kneeled at the Mirror to adore himself the
480,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Lady Eve abode unwillingly, and in time she asked: “Have I then no part"
481,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,in this worship?” Adam answered: “A great and a redoubtable part hast
482,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"thou, O my Lady, which is to praise and worship me constantly.” The"
483,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Lady Eve said: “But I weary of this worship. Except thou build me an
484,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Altar and make a Mirror to me also I will in no wise be present at this
485,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"worship, nor in thy bed.” And she withdrew her presence. Adam then said"
486,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,to Jibrail whom he esteemed to be the Peacock: “What shall we do? If I
487,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"build not an Altar, the Woman who walks by my side will be a reproach"
488,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"to me by day and a penance by night, and peace will depart from the"
489,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"earth.” Jibrail answered, in the voice of the Peacock: “For the sake of"
490,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Peace on earth build her also an Altar.” So they built an Altar with a
491,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Mirror in all respects conformable to the Altar which Adam had made,"
492,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,and Adam made proclamation from the ends of the earth to the ends of
493,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"the earth that there were now two Gods upon earth--the one Man, and the"
494,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,other Woman.
495,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
496,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Then came the Peacock in the likeness of Jibrail to the Lady Eve and
497,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"said: “O Lady of Light, why is thy Altar upon the left hand and"
498,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,the Altar of my Lord upon the right?” The Lady Eve said: “It is a
499,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"remediable error,” and she remedied it with her own hands, and our"
500,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,pure Forefather fell into a great anger. Then entered Jibrail in
501,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,the likeness of the Peacock and said to Adam: “O my Lord and Very
502,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Interpreter, what has vexed thee?” Adam said: “What shall we do? The"
503,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Woman who sleeps in my bosom has changed the honourable places of the
504,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Altars, and if I suffer not the change she will weary me by night"
505,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"and day, and there will be no refreshment upon earth.” Jibrail said,"
506,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,speaking in the voice of the Peacock: “For the sake of refreshment
507,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"suffer the change.” So they worshipped at the changed Altars, the Altar"
508,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"to the Woman upon the right, and to the Man upon the left."
509,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
510,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Then came the Peacock, in the similitude of Jibrail the Trusty One,"
511,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"to our Lady Eve and said: “O Incomparable and All-Creating, art thou"
512,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,by chance the mother of Quabil and Habil (Cain and Abel)?” The Lady
513,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Eve answered: “By no chance but by the immutable ordinance of Nature
514,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"am I their Mother.” The Peacock said, in the voice of Jibrail: “Will"
515,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"they become such as Adam?” The Lady Eve answered: “Of a surety, and"
516,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"many more also.” The Peacock, as Jibrail, said: “O Lady of Abundance,"
517,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"enlighten me now which is the greater, the mother or the child?” The"
518,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Lady Eve answered: “Of a surety, the mother.” The disguised Peacock"
519,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"then said: “O my Lady, seeing that from thee alone proceed all the"
520,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"generations of Man who calls himself God, what need of any Altar to"
521,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Man?” The Lady Eve answered: “It is an error. Doubt not it shall
522,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"be rectified,” and at the time of the Worship she smote down the"
523,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"left-hand Altar. Adam said: “Why is this, O my Lady and my Co-equal?”"
524,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,The Lady Eve answered: “Because it has been revealed that in Me is
525,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"all excellence and increase, splendour, terror, and power. Bow down"
526,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"and worship.” Adam answered: “O my Lady, but thou art Eve my mate and"
527,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,no sort of goddess whatever. This have I known from the beginning.
528,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Only for Peace’ sake I suffered thee to build an Altar to thyself.”
529,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"The Lady Eve answered: “O my Lord, but thou art Adam my mate, and by"
530,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"many universes removed from any sort of Godhead, and this have I known"
531,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,from the first. Nor for the sake of any peace whatever will I cease
532,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"to proclaim it.” She then proclaimed it aloud, and they reproached"
533,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,each other and disputed and betrayed their thoughts and their inmost
534,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,knowledges until the Peacock lifted himself in haste from their
535,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,presence and came to Jibrail and said: “Let us return each to his own
536,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,shape; for Enlightenment is at hand.”
537,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
538,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,*       *       *       *       *
539,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
540,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,So restitution was made without fraud or dishonour and they returned to
541,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"the temple each in his proper shape with his attributes, and listened"
542,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,to the end of that conversation between the First Substitute and his
543,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,august Consort who ceased not to reprehend each other upon all matters
544,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,within their observation and their experience and their imagination.
545,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
546,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,When the steeds of recrimination had ceased to career across the plains
547,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"of memory, and when the drum of evidence was no longer beaten by the"
548,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"drumstick of malevolence, and the bird of argument had taken refuge in"
549,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"the rocks of silence, the Excellent and Trustworthy Archangel Jibrail"
550,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,bowed himself before our pure Forefather and said: “O my Lord and Fount
551,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"of all Power and Wisdom, is it permitted to worship the Visible God?”"
552,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
553,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Then by the operation of the Mercy of Allah, the string was loosed in"
554,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,the throat of our First Substitute and the oppression was lifted from
555,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,his lungs and he laughed without cessation and said: “By Allah I am no
556,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"God but the mate of this most detestable Woman whom I love, and who"
557,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,is necessary to me beyond all the necessities.” But he ceased not to
558,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,entertain Jibrail with tales of the follies and the unreasonableness of
559,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,our Lady Eve till the night time.
560,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
561,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,The Peacock also bowed before the Lady Eve and said: “Is it permitted
562,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,to adore the Source and the Excellence?” and the string was loosened in
563,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,the Lady Eve’s throat and she laughed aloud and merrily and said: “By
564,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Allah I am no goddess in any sort, but the mate of this mere Man whom,"
565,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"in spite of all, I love beyond and above my soul.” But she detained the"
566,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Peacock with tales of the stupidity and the childishness of our pure
567,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Forefather till the Sun rose.
568,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
569,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Then Adam entered, and the two looked upon each other laughing. Then"
570,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"said Adam: “O my Lady and Crown of my Torments, is it peace between"
571,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,us?” And our Lady Eve answered: “O my Lord and sole Cause of my
572,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Unreason, it is peace till the next time and the next occasion.” And"
573,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Adam said: “I accept, and I abide the chance.” Our Lady Eve said: “O"
574,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"Man, wouldst thou have it otherwise upon any composition?” Adam said:"
575,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,"“O Woman, upon no composition would I have it otherwise--not even for"
576,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,the return to the Garden of the Tree; and this I swear on thy head and
577,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,the heads of all who shall proceed from thee.” And Eve said: “I also.”
578,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,So they removed both Altars and laughed and built a new one between.
579,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,
580,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,Then Jibrail and the Peacock departed and prostrated themselves before
581,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,the Throne and told what had been said. It was answered: “How left

585,THE ENEMIES TO EACH OTHER,

606,THE CHANGELINGS,
607,THE CHANGELINGS,"I was a dealer in stocks and shares,"

639,SEA CONSTABLES,
640,SEA CONSTABLES,The head-waiter of the Carvoitz almost ran to meet Portson and his
641,SEA CONSTABLES,guests as they came up the steps from the palm-court where the string
642,SEA CONSTABLES,band plays.
643,SEA CONSTABLES,
644,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Not seen you since--oh, ever so long,” he began. “_So_ glad to get"
645,SEA CONSTABLES,your wire. Quite well--eh?”
646,SEA CONSTABLES,
647,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Fair to middling, Henri,” Portson shook hands with him. “You’re"
648,SEA CONSTABLES,"looking all right, too. Have you got us our table?”"
649,SEA CONSTABLES,
650,SEA CONSTABLES,"Henri nodded towards a pink alcove, kept for mixed doubles, which"
651,SEA CONSTABLES,discreetly commanded the main dining-room’s glitter and blaze.
652,SEA CONSTABLES,
653,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Good man!” said Portson. “Now, this is serious, Henri. We put"
654,SEA CONSTABLES,ourselves unreservedly in your hands. We’re weather-beaten
655,SEA CONSTABLES,"mariners--though we don’t look it, and we haven’t eaten a Christian"
656,SEA CONSTABLES,"meal in months. Have you thought of all that, Henri, mon ami?”"
657,SEA CONSTABLES,
658,SEA CONSTABLES,"“The menu, I have compose it myself,” Henri answered with the gravity"
659,SEA CONSTABLES,of a high priest.
660,SEA CONSTABLES,
661,SEA CONSTABLES,"It was more than a year since Portson--of Portson, Peake and Ensell,"
662,SEA CONSTABLES,Stock and Share Brokers--had drawn Henri’s attention to an apparently
663,SEA CONSTABLES,"extinct Oil Company which, a little later, erupted profitably; and it"
664,SEA CONSTABLES,may be that Henri prided himself on paying all debts in full.
665,SEA CONSTABLES,
666,SEA CONSTABLES,The most recent foreign millionaire and the even more recent foreign
667,SEA CONSTABLES,actress at a table near the entrance clamoured for his attention while
668,SEA CONSTABLES,he convoyed the party to the pink alcove. With his own hands he turned
669,SEA CONSTABLES,out some befrilled electrics and lit four pale-rose candles.
670,SEA CONSTABLES,
671,SEA CONSTABLES,“Bridal!” some one murmured. “Quite bridal!”
672,SEA CONSTABLES,
673,SEA CONSTABLES,"“_So_ glad you like. There is nothing too good.” Henri slid away,"
674,SEA CONSTABLES,and the four men sat down. They had the coarse-grained complexions
675,SEA CONSTABLES,"of men who habitually did themselves well, and an air, too, of"
676,SEA CONSTABLES,"recent, red-eyed dissipation. Maddingham, the eldest, was a thick-set"
677,SEA CONSTABLES,"middle-aged presence, with crisped grizzled hair, of the type that one"
678,SEA CONSTABLES,"associates with Board Meetings. He limped slightly. Tegg, who followed"
679,SEA CONSTABLES,"him, blinking, was neat, small, and sandy, of unmistakable Wavy cut,"
680,SEA CONSTABLES,"but sheepish aspect. Winchmore, the youngest, was more on the lines of"
681,SEA CONSTABLES,"the conventional pre-war “nut,” but his eyes were sunk in his head and"
682,SEA CONSTABLES,"his hands black-nailed and roughened. Portson, their host, with Vandyke"
683,SEA CONSTABLES,"beard and a comfortable little stomach, beamed upon them as they"
684,SEA CONSTABLES,settled to their oysters.
685,SEA CONSTABLES,
686,SEA CONSTABLES,"“_That’s_ what I mean,” said the carrying voice of the foreign actress,"
687,SEA CONSTABLES,whom Henri had just disabused of the idea that she had been promised
688,SEA CONSTABLES,"the pink alcove. “They ain’t _alive_ to the war yet. Now, what’s the"
689,SEA CONSTABLES,matter with those four dubs yonder joining the British Army or--or
690,SEA CONSTABLES,_doing_ something?”
691,SEA CONSTABLES,
692,SEA CONSTABLES,“Who’s your friend?” Maddingham asked.
693,SEA CONSTABLES,
694,SEA CONSTABLES,"“I’ve forgotten her name for the minute,” Portson replied, “but she’s"
695,SEA CONSTABLES,the latest thing in imported patriotic piece-goods. She sings ‘Sons of
696,SEA CONSTABLES,"the Empire, Go Forward!’ at the Palemseum. It makes the aunties weep.”"
697,SEA CONSTABLES,
698,SEA CONSTABLES,"“That’s Sidney Latter. She’s not half bad,” Tegg reached for the"
699,SEA CONSTABLES,vinegar. “We ought to see her some night.”
700,SEA CONSTABLES,
701,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Yes. We’ve a lot of time for that sort of thing,” Maddingham grunted."
702,SEA CONSTABLES,"“I’ll take your oysters, Portson, if you don’t want ’em.”"
703,SEA CONSTABLES,
704,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Cheer up, Papa Maddingham! ’Soon be dead!” Winchmore suggested."
705,SEA CONSTABLES,
706,SEA CONSTABLES,"Maddingham glared at him. “If I’d had you with me for _one_ week,"
707,SEA CONSTABLES,Master Winchmore----”
708,SEA CONSTABLES,
709,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Not the least use,” the boy retorted. “I’ve just been made a"
710,SEA CONSTABLES,full-lootenant. I have indeed. I couldn’t reconcile it with my
711,SEA CONSTABLES,conscience to take _Etheldreda_ out any more as a plain sub. She’s too
712,SEA CONSTABLES,flat in the floor.”
713,SEA CONSTABLES,
714,SEA CONSTABLES,“Did you get those new washboards of yours fixed?” Tegg cut in.
715,SEA CONSTABLES,
716,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Don’t talk shop already,” Portson protested. “This is Vesiga soup. I"
717,SEA CONSTABLES,don’t know what he’s arranged in the way of drinks.”
718,SEA CONSTABLES,
719,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Pol Roger ’04,” said the waiter."
720,SEA CONSTABLES,
721,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Sound man, Henri,” said Winchmore. “But,” he eyed the waiter"
722,SEA CONSTABLES,"doubtfully, “I don’t quite like.... What’s your alleged nationality?”"
723,SEA CONSTABLES,
724,SEA CONSTABLES,"“’Henri’s nephew, monsieur,” the smiling waiter replied, and laid"
725,SEA CONSTABLES,a gloved hand on the table. It creaked corkily at the wrist.
726,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Bethisy-sur-Oise,” he explained. “My uncle he buy me _all_ the hand"
727,SEA CONSTABLES,for Christmas. It is good to hold plates only.”
728,SEA CONSTABLES,
729,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Oh! Sorry I spoke,” said Winchmore."
730,SEA CONSTABLES,
731,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Monsieur is right. But my uncle is very careful, even with neutrals.”"
732,SEA CONSTABLES,He poured the champagne.
733,SEA CONSTABLES,
734,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Hold a minute,” Maddingham cried. “First toast of obligation: For what"
735,SEA CONSTABLES,"we are going to receive, thank God and the British Navy.”"
736,SEA CONSTABLES,
737,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Amen!” said the others with a nod towards Lieutenant Tegg, of the"
738,SEA CONSTABLES,"Royal Navy afloat, and, occasionally, of the Admiralty ashore."
739,SEA CONSTABLES,
740,SEA CONSTABLES,“Next! ‘Damnation to all neutrals!’” Maddingham went on.
741,SEA CONSTABLES,
742,SEA CONSTABLES,“Amen! Amen!” they answered between gulps that heralded the sole à
743,SEA CONSTABLES,"la Colbert. Maddingham picked up the menu. “Suprème of chicken,” he"
744,SEA CONSTABLES,"read loudly. “Filet béarnaise, Woodcock and Richebourg ’74, Pêches"
745,SEA CONSTABLES,"Melba, Croûtes Baron. I couldn’t have improved on it myself; though one"
746,SEA CONSTABLES,"might,” he went on--“one _might_ have substituted quail _en casserole_"
747,SEA CONSTABLES,for the woodcock.”
748,SEA CONSTABLES,
749,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Then there would have been no reason for the Burgundy,” said Tegg with"
750,SEA CONSTABLES,equal gravity.
751,SEA CONSTABLES,
752,SEA CONSTABLES,"“You’re right,” Maddingham replied."
753,SEA CONSTABLES,
754,SEA CONSTABLES,The foreign actress shrugged her shoulders. “What _can_ you do with
755,SEA CONSTABLES,people like that?” she said to her companion. “And yet _I_’ve been
756,SEA CONSTABLES,singing to ’em for a fortnight.”
757,SEA CONSTABLES,
758,SEA CONSTABLES,"“I left it all to Henri,” said Portson."
759,SEA CONSTABLES,
760,SEA CONSTABLES,“My Gord!” the eavesdropping woman whispered. “Get on to that! Ain’t it
761,SEA CONSTABLES,typical? They leave everything to Henri in this country.”
762,SEA CONSTABLES,
763,SEA CONSTABLES,"“By the way,” Tegg asked Winchmore after the fish, “where did you mount"
764,SEA CONSTABLES,that one-pounder of yours after all?”
765,SEA CONSTABLES,
766,SEA CONSTABLES,“Midships. _Etheldreda_ won’t carry more weight forward. She’s wet
767,SEA CONSTABLES,enough as it is.”
768,SEA CONSTABLES,
769,SEA CONSTABLES,“Why don’t you apply for another craft?” Portson put in. “There’s a
770,SEA CONSTABLES,"chap at Southampton just now, down with pneumonia and----”"
771,SEA CONSTABLES,
772,SEA CONSTABLES,"“No, thank you. I know _Etheldreda_. She’s nothing to write home about,"
773,SEA CONSTABLES,but when she feels well she can shift a bit.”
774,SEA CONSTABLES,
775,SEA CONSTABLES,Maddingham leaned across the table. “If she does more than eleven in a
776,SEA CONSTABLES,"flat calm,” said he, “I’ll--I’ll give you _Hilarity_.”"
777,SEA CONSTABLES,
778,SEA CONSTABLES,"“’Wouldn’t be found dead in _Hilarity_,” was Winchmore’s grateful"
779,SEA CONSTABLES,"reply. “You don’t mean to say you’ve taken her into real wet water,"
780,SEA CONSTABLES,Papa? Where did it happen?”
781,SEA CONSTABLES,
782,SEA CONSTABLES,"The other laughed. Maddingham’s red face turned brick colour, and the"
783,SEA CONSTABLES,veins on the cheekbones showed blue through a blurr of short bristles.
784,SEA CONSTABLES,
785,SEA CONSTABLES,"“He’s been convoying neutrals--in a tactful manner,” Tegg chuckled."
786,SEA CONSTABLES,
787,SEA CONSTABLES,"Maddingham filled his glass and scowled at Tegg. “Yes,” he said,"
788,SEA CONSTABLES,“and here’s special damnation to me Lords of the Admiralty. A more
789,SEA CONSTABLES,muddle-headed set of brass-bound apes----”
790,SEA CONSTABLES,
791,SEA CONSTABLES,“My! My! My!” Winchmore chirruped soothingly. “It don’t seem to have
792,SEA CONSTABLES,"done you any good, Papa. Who were you conveyancing?”"
793,SEA CONSTABLES,
794,SEA CONSTABLES,Maddingham snapped out a ship’s name and some details of her build.
795,SEA CONSTABLES,
796,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Oh, but that chap’s a friend of _mine_!” cried Winchmore. “I ran"
797,SEA CONSTABLES,"across him--the--not so long ago, hugging the Scotch coast--out of his"
798,SEA CONSTABLES,"course, he said, owing to foul weather and a new type of engine--a"
799,SEA CONSTABLES,"Diesel. That’s him, ain’t it--the complete neutral?” He mentioned an"
800,SEA CONSTABLES,outstanding peculiarity of the ship’s rig.
801,SEA CONSTABLES,
802,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Yes,” said Portson. “Did you board him, Winchmore?”"
803,SEA CONSTABLES,
804,SEA CONSTABLES,“No. There’d been a bit of a blow the day before and old _Ethel’s_
805,SEA CONSTABLES,only dinghy had dropped off the hooks. But he signalled me all his
806,SEA CONSTABLES,symptoms. He was as communicative as--as a lady in the Promenade. (Hold
807,SEA CONSTABLES,"on, Nephew of my Uncle! I’m going to have some more of that Béarnaise"
808,SEA CONSTABLES,fillet.) His smell attracted me. I chaperoned him for a couple of days.”
809,SEA CONSTABLES,
810,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Only two days. _You_ hadn’t anything to complain of,” said Maddingham"
811,SEA CONSTABLES,wrathfully.
812,SEA CONSTABLES,
813,SEA CONSTABLES,"“I didn’t complain. If he chose to hug things, ’twasn’t any of my"
814,SEA CONSTABLES,"business. I’m not a Purity League. ’Didn’t care what he hugged, so long"
815,SEA CONSTABLES,as I could lie behind him and give him first chop at any mines that
816,SEA CONSTABLES,"were going. I steered in his wake (I really _can_ steer a bit now,"
817,SEA CONSTABLES,Portson) and let him stink up the whole of the North Sea. I thought he
818,SEA CONSTABLES,"might come in useful for bait. No Burgundy, thanks, Nephew of my Uncle."
819,SEA CONSTABLES,I’m sticking to the Jolly Roger.”
820,SEA CONSTABLES,
821,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Go on, then--before you’re speechless. Was he any use as bait?” Tegg"
822,SEA CONSTABLES,demanded.
823,SEA CONSTABLES,
824,SEA CONSTABLES,"“We never got a fair chance. As I told you, he hugged the coast till"
825,SEA CONSTABLES,"dark, and then he scraped round Gilarra Head and went up the bay nearly"
826,SEA CONSTABLES,to the beach.”
827,SEA CONSTABLES,
828,SEA CONSTABLES,“’Lights out?” Maddingham asked.
829,SEA CONSTABLES,
830,SEA CONSTABLES,Winchmore nodded. “But I didn’t worry about that. I was under his
831,SEA CONSTABLES,"stern. As luck ’ud have it, there was a fishing-party in the bay, and"
832,SEA CONSTABLES,we walked slam into the middle of ’em--a most ungodly collection of
833,SEA CONSTABLES,"local talent. ’First thing I knew a steam-launch fell aboard us, and a"
834,SEA CONSTABLES,"boy--a nasty little Navy boy, Tegg--wanted to know what I was doing."
835,SEA CONSTABLES,"I told him, and he cursed me for putting the fish down just as they"
836,SEA CONSTABLES,were rising. Then the two of us (he was hanging on to my quarter with a
837,SEA CONSTABLES,boat-hook) drifted on to a steam trawler and our friend the Neutral and
838,SEA CONSTABLES,"a ten-oared cutter full of the military, all mixed up. They were subs"
839,SEA CONSTABLES,from the garrison out for a lark. Uncle Newt explained over the rail
840,SEA CONSTABLES,"about the weather and his engine-troubles, but they were all so keen to"
841,SEA CONSTABLES,"carry on with their fishing, they didn’t fuss. They told him to clear"
842,SEA CONSTABLES,off.”
843,SEA CONSTABLES,
844,SEA CONSTABLES,“Was there anything on the move round Gilarra at that time?” Tegg
845,SEA CONSTABLES,inquired.
846,SEA CONSTABLES,
847,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Oh, they spun me the usual yarns about the water being thick with ’em,"
848,SEA CONSTABLES,and asked me to help; but I couldn’t stop. The cutter’s stern-sheets
849,SEA CONSTABLES,"were piled up with mines, like lobster-pots, and from the way the"
850,SEA CONSTABLES,soldiers handled ’em I thought I’d better get out. So did Uncle Newt.
851,SEA CONSTABLES,_He_ didn’t like it a bit. There were a couple of shots fired at
852,SEA CONSTABLES,"something just as we cleared the Head, and one dropped rather close"
853,SEA CONSTABLES,to him. (These duck-shoots in the dark are dam’ dangerous y’know.) He
854,SEA CONSTABLES,"lit up at once--tail-light, head-light, and side-lights. I had no more"
855,SEA CONSTABLES,trouble with him the rest of the night.”
856,SEA CONSTABLES,
857,SEA CONSTABLES,“But what about the report that you sawed off the steam-launch’s
858,SEA CONSTABLES,boat-hook?” Tegg demanded suddenly.
859,SEA CONSTABLES,
860,SEA CONSTABLES,“What! You don’t mean to say that little beast of a snotty reported it?
861,SEA CONSTABLES,He was scratchin’ poor old _Ethel’s_ paint to pieces. I never reported
862,SEA CONSTABLES,"what he said to _me_. And he called me a damned amateur, too. Well!"
863,SEA CONSTABLES,Well! War’s war. I missed all that fishing-party that time. My orders
864,SEA CONSTABLES,were to follow Uncle Newt. So I followed--and poor _Ethel_ without a
865,SEA CONSTABLES,dry rag on her.”
866,SEA CONSTABLES,
867,SEA CONSTABLES,Winchmore refilled his glass.
868,SEA CONSTABLES,
869,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Well, don’t get poetical,” said Portson. “Let’s have the rest of your"
870,SEA CONSTABLES,trip.”
871,SEA CONSTABLES,
872,SEA CONSTABLES,"“There wasn’t any rest,” Winchmore insisted pathetically. “There was"
873,SEA CONSTABLES,"just good old _Ethel_ with her engines missing like sin, and Uncle"
874,SEA CONSTABLES,"Newt thumping and stinking half a mile ahead of us, and me eating"
875,SEA CONSTABLES,"bread and Worcester sauce. I do when I feel that way. Besides, I"
876,SEA CONSTABLES,wanted to go back and join the fishing-party. Just before dark I made
877,SEA CONSTABLES,out _Cordelia_--that Southampton ketch that old Jarrott fitted with
878,SEA CONSTABLES,"oil auxiliaries for a family cruiser last summer. She’s a beamy bus,"
879,SEA CONSTABLES,"but she _can_ roll, and she was doing an honest thirty degrees each"
880,SEA CONSTABLES,way when I overhauled her. I asked Jarrott if he was busy. He said he
881,SEA CONSTABLES,wasn’t. But he was. He’s like me and Nelson when there’s any sea on.”
882,SEA CONSTABLES,
883,SEA CONSTABLES,“But Jarrott’s a Quaker. ’Has been for generations. Why does he go to
884,SEA CONSTABLES,war?” said Maddingham.
885,SEA CONSTABLES,
886,SEA CONSTABLES,"“If it comes to that,” Portson said, “why do any of us?”"
887,SEA CONSTABLES,
888,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Jarrott’s a mine-sweeper,” Winchmore replied with deep feeling. “The"
889,SEA CONSTABLES,"Quaker religion (I’m not a Quaker, but I’m _much_ more religious than"
890,SEA CONSTABLES,any of you chaps give me credit for) has decided that mine-sweeping
891,SEA CONSTABLES,is lifesaving. Consequently”--he dwelt a little on the word--“the
892,SEA CONSTABLES,profession is crowded with Quakers--specially off Scarborough. ’See?
893,SEA CONSTABLES,"Owin’ to the purity of their lives, they ‘_all_ go to Heaven when they"
894,SEA CONSTABLES,"die--Roll, Jordan, Roll!’”"
895,SEA CONSTABLES,
896,SEA CONSTABLES,*       *       *       *       *
897,SEA CONSTABLES,
898,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Disgustin’,” said the actress audibly as she drew on her gloves."
899,SEA CONSTABLES,"Winchmore looked at her with delight. “That’s a peach-Melba, too,” he"
900,SEA CONSTABLES,said.
901,SEA CONSTABLES,
902,SEA CONSTABLES,"“And David Jarrott’s a mine-sweeper,” Maddingham mused aloud. “So you"
903,SEA CONSTABLES,"turned our Neutral over to him, Winchmore, did you?”"
904,SEA CONSTABLES,
905,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Yes, I did. It was the end of my beat--I wish I didn’t feel so"
906,SEA CONSTABLES,"sleepy--and I explained the whole situation to Jarrott, over the"
907,SEA CONSTABLES,"rail. ’Gave him all my silly instructions--those latest ones,"
908,SEA CONSTABLES,y’know. I told him to do nothing to imperil existing political
909,SEA CONSTABLES,relations. I told him to exercise tact. I--I told him that in
910,SEA CONSTABLES,"my capac’ty as Actin’ Lootenant, you see. Jarrott’s only a"
911,SEA CONSTABLES,"Lootenant-Commander--at fifty-four, too! Yes, I handed my Uncle Newt"
912,SEA CONSTABLES,"over to Jarrott to chaperone, and I went back to my--I can say it"
913,SEA CONSTABLES,perfectly--pis-ca-to-rial party in the bay. Now I’m going to have
914,SEA CONSTABLES,a nap. In ten minutes I shall be on deck again. This is my first
915,SEA CONSTABLES,"civilised dinner in nine weeks, so I don’t apologise.”"
916,SEA CONSTABLES,
917,SEA CONSTABLES,"He pushed his plate away, dropped his chin on his palm and closed his"
918,SEA CONSTABLES,eyes.
919,SEA CONSTABLES,
920,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Lyndnoch and Jarrott’s Bank, established 1793,” said Maddingham half"
921,SEA CONSTABLES,to himself. “I’ve seen old Jarrott in Cowes week bullied by his skipper
922,SEA CONSTABLES,and steward till he had to sneak ashore to sleep. And now he’s out
923,SEA CONSTABLES,mine-sweeping with _Cordelia_! What’s happened to his--I shall forget
924,SEA CONSTABLES,my own name next--Belfast-built two-hundred tonner?”
925,SEA CONSTABLES,
926,SEA CONSTABLES,"“_Goneril_,” said Portson. “He turned her over to the Service in"
927,SEA CONSTABLES,October. She’s--she was _Culana_.”
928,SEA CONSTABLES,
929,SEA CONSTABLES,"“_She_ was _Culana_, was she? My God! I never knew that. Where did it"
930,SEA CONSTABLES,happen?”
931,SEA CONSTABLES,
932,SEA CONSTABLES,“Off the same old Irish corner I was watching last month. My young
933,SEA CONSTABLES,cousin was in her; so was one of the Raikes boys. A whole nest of
934,SEA CONSTABLES,"mines, laid between patrols.”"
935,SEA CONSTABLES,
936,SEA CONSTABLES,"“I’ve heard there’s some dirty work going on there now,” Maddingham"
937,SEA CONSTABLES,half whispered.
938,SEA CONSTABLES,
939,SEA CONSTABLES,"“You needn’t tell _me_ that,” Portson returned. “But one gets a little"
940,SEA CONSTABLES,back now and again.”
941,SEA CONSTABLES,
942,SEA CONSTABLES,"“What are you two talking about?” said Tegg, who seemed to be dozing,"
943,SEA CONSTABLES,too.
944,SEA CONSTABLES,
945,SEA CONSTABLES,"“_Culana_,” Portson answered as he lit a cigarette."
946,SEA CONSTABLES,
947,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Yes, that was rather a pity. But.... What about this Newt of ours?”"
948,SEA CONSTABLES,
949,SEA CONSTABLES,"“_I_ took her over from Jarrott next day--off Margate,” said Portson."
950,SEA CONSTABLES,“Jarrott wanted to get back to his mine-sweeping.”
951,SEA CONSTABLES,
952,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Every man to his taste,” said Maddingham. “That never appealed to me."
953,SEA CONSTABLES,Had they detailed you specially to look after the Newt?”
954,SEA CONSTABLES,
955,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Me among others,” Portson admitted. “I was going down Channel when I"
956,SEA CONSTABLES,"got my orders, and so I went on with him. Jarrott had been tremendously"
957,SEA CONSTABLES,interested in his course up to date--specially off the Wash. He’d
958,SEA CONSTABLES,charted it very carefully and he said he was going back to find out
959,SEA CONSTABLES,"what some of the kinks and curves meant. Has he found out, Tegg?”"
960,SEA CONSTABLES,
961,SEA CONSTABLES,*       *       *       *       *
962,SEA CONSTABLES,
963,SEA CONSTABLES,Tegg thought for a moment. “_Cordelia_ was all right up to six o’clock
964,SEA CONSTABLES,"yesterday evening,” he said."
965,SEA CONSTABLES,
966,SEA CONSTABLES,“’Glad of that. Then I did what Winchmore did. I lay behind this stout
967,SEA CONSTABLES,fellow and saw him well into the open.”
968,SEA CONSTABLES,
969,SEA CONSTABLES,“Did you say anything to him?” Tegg asked.
970,SEA CONSTABLES,
971,SEA CONSTABLES,“Not a thing. He kept moving all the time.”
972,SEA CONSTABLES,
973,SEA CONSTABLES,“’See anything?” Tegg continued.
974,SEA CONSTABLES,
975,SEA CONSTABLES,"“No. He didn’t seem to be in demand anywhere in the Channel, and, when"
976,SEA CONSTABLES,I got him on the edge of soundings I dropped him--as per your esteemed
977,SEA CONSTABLES,orders.”
978,SEA CONSTABLES,
979,SEA CONSTABLES,Tegg nodded again and murmured some apology.
980,SEA CONSTABLES,
981,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Where did _you_ pick him up, Maddingham?” Portson went on."
982,SEA CONSTABLES,
983,SEA CONSTABLES,Maddingham snorted.
984,SEA CONSTABLES,
985,SEA CONSTABLES,“Well north and west of where you left him heading up the Irish Channel
986,SEA CONSTABLES,and stinking like a taxi. I hadn’t had my breakfast. My cook was
987,SEA CONSTABLES,seasick; so were four of my hands.”
988,SEA CONSTABLES,
989,SEA CONSTABLES,“I can see that meeting. Did you give him a gun across the bows?” Tegg
990,SEA CONSTABLES,asked.
991,SEA CONSTABLES,
992,SEA CONSTABLES,"“No, no. Not _that_ time. I signalled him to heave to. He had his"
993,SEA CONSTABLES,"papers ready before I came over the side. You see,” Maddingham said"
994,SEA CONSTABLES,"pleadingly, “I’m new to this business. Perhaps I wasn’t as polite to"
995,SEA CONSTABLES,him as I should have been if I’d had my breakfast.”
996,SEA CONSTABLES,
997,SEA CONSTABLES,"“He deposed that Maddingham came alongside swearing like a bargee,”"
998,SEA CONSTABLES,said Tegg.
999,SEA CONSTABLES,
1000,SEA CONSTABLES,“Not in the least. This is what happened.” Maddingham turned to
1001,SEA CONSTABLES,Portson. “I asked him where he was bound for and he told me--Antigua.”
1002,SEA CONSTABLES,
1003,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Hi! Wake up, Winchmore. You’re missing something.” Portson nudged"
1004,SEA CONSTABLES,"Winchmore, who was slanting sideways in his chair."
1005,SEA CONSTABLES,
1006,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Right! All right! I’m awake,” said Winchmore stickily. “I heard every"
1007,SEA CONSTABLES,word.”
1008,SEA CONSTABLES,
1009,SEA CONSTABLES,Maddingham went on. “I told him that this wasn’t his way to Antigua----”
1010,SEA CONSTABLES,
1011,SEA CONSTABLES,“Antigua. Antigua!” Winchmore finished rubbing his eyes. “‘There was a
1012,SEA CONSTABLES,young bride of Antigua----’”
1013,SEA CONSTABLES,
1014,SEA CONSTABLES,“Hsh! Hsh!” said Portson and Tegg warningly.
1015,SEA CONSTABLES,
1016,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Why? It’s the proper one. ‘Who said to her spouse, “What a pig you"
1017,SEA CONSTABLES,are!”’”
1018,SEA CONSTABLES,
1019,SEA CONSTABLES,“Ass!” Maddingham growled and continued: “He told me that he’d been
1020,SEA CONSTABLES,"knocked out of his reckoning by foul weather and engine-trouble, owing"
1021,SEA CONSTABLES,to experimenting with a new type of Diesel engine. He was perfectly
1022,SEA CONSTABLES,frank about it.”
1023,SEA CONSTABLES,
1024,SEA CONSTABLES,"“So he was with me,” said Winchmore. “Just like a real lady. I hope you"
1025,SEA CONSTABLES,"were a real gentleman, Papa.”"
1026,SEA CONSTABLES,
1027,SEA CONSTABLES,“I asked him what he’d got. He didn’t object. He had some fifty
1028,SEA CONSTABLES,"thousand gallon of oil for his new Diesel engine, and the rest was"
1029,SEA CONSTABLES,"coal. He said he needed the oil to get to Antigua with, he was taking"
1030,SEA CONSTABLES,"the coal as ballast, and he was coming back, so he told me, with"
1031,SEA CONSTABLES,"coconuts. When he’d quite finished, I said: ‘What sort of damned idiot"
1032,SEA CONSTABLES,do you take me for?’ He said: ‘I haven’t decided yet!’ Then I said he’d
1033,SEA CONSTABLES,"better come into port with me, and we’d arrive at a decision. He said"
1034,SEA CONSTABLES,"that his papers were in perfect order and that my instructions--mine,"
1035,SEA CONSTABLES,please!--were not to imperil political relations. I hadn’t received
1036,SEA CONSTABLES,"these asinine instructions, so I took the liberty of contradicting"
1037,SEA CONSTABLES,"him--perfectly politely, as I told them at the Inquiry afterward."
1038,SEA CONSTABLES,"He was a small-boned man with a grey beard, in a glengarry, and he"
1039,SEA CONSTABLES,"picked his teeth a lot. He said: ‘The last time I met you, Mister"
1040,SEA CONSTABLES,"Maddingham, you were going to Carlsbad, and you told me all about your"
1041,SEA CONSTABLES,blood-pressures in the wagon-lit before we tossed for upper berth.
1042,SEA CONSTABLES,Don’t you think you are a little old to buccaneer about the sea this
1043,SEA CONSTABLES,way?’ I couldn’t recall his face--he must have been some fellow that
1044,SEA CONSTABLES,I’d travelled with some time or other. I told him I wasn’t doing
1045,SEA CONSTABLES,this for amusement--it was business. Then I ordered him into port.
1046,SEA CONSTABLES,He said: ‘S’pose I don’t go?’ I said: ‘Then I’ll sink you.’ Isn’t it
1047,SEA CONSTABLES,extraordinary how natural it all seems after a few weeks? If any one
1048,SEA CONSTABLES,had told me when I commissioned _Hilarity_ last summer what I’d be
1049,SEA CONSTABLES,"doing this spring I’d--I’d ... God! It _is_ mad, isn’t it?”"
1050,SEA CONSTABLES,
1051,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Quite,” said Portson. “But not bad fun.”"
1052,SEA CONSTABLES,
1053,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Not at all, but that’s what makes it all the madder. Well, he didn’t"
1054,SEA CONSTABLES,argue any more. He warned me I’d be hauled over the coals for what I’d
1055,SEA CONSTABLES,"done, and I warned him to keep two cables ahead of me and not to yaw.”"
1056,SEA CONSTABLES,
1057,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Jaw?” said Winchmore, sleepily."
1058,SEA CONSTABLES,
1059,SEA CONSTABLES,"“No. Yaw,” Maddingham snarled. “Not to look as if he even wanted to"
1060,SEA CONSTABLES,"yaw. I warned him that, if he did, I’d loose off into him, end-on. But"
1061,SEA CONSTABLES,"I was absolutely polite about it. ’Give you my word, Tegg.”"
1062,SEA CONSTABLES,
1063,SEA CONSTABLES,"“I believe you. Oh, I believe you,” Tegg replied."
1064,SEA CONSTABLES,
1065,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Well, so I took him into port--and that was where I first ran across"
1066,SEA CONSTABLES,our Master Tegg. He represented the Admiralty on that beach.”
1067,SEA CONSTABLES,
1068,SEA CONSTABLES,"The small blinking man nodded. “The Admiralty had that honour,” he said"
1069,SEA CONSTABLES,graciously.
1070,SEA CONSTABLES,
1071,SEA CONSTABLES,Maddingham turned to the others angrily. “I’d been rather patting
1072,SEA CONSTABLES,"myself on the back for what I’d done, you know. Instead of which, they"
1073,SEA CONSTABLES,held a court-martial----”
1074,SEA CONSTABLES,
1075,SEA CONSTABLES,"“_We_ called it an Inquiry,” Tegg interjected."
1076,SEA CONSTABLES,
1077,SEA CONSTABLES,“_You_ weren’t in the dock. They held a court-martial on me to find
1078,SEA CONSTABLES,"out how often I’d sworn at the poor injured Neutral, and whether I’d"
1079,SEA CONSTABLES,given him hot-water bottles and tucked him up at night. It’s all very
1080,SEA CONSTABLES,"fine to laugh, but they treated me like a pickpocket. There were two"
1081,SEA CONSTABLES,fat-headed civilian judges and that blackguard Tegg in the conspiracy.
1082,SEA CONSTABLES,A cursed lawyer defended my Neutral and he made fun of _me_. He dragged
1083,SEA CONSTABLES,in everything the Neutral had told him about my blood-pressures on the
1084,SEA CONSTABLES,Carlsbad trip. And that’s what you get for trying to serve your country
1085,SEA CONSTABLES,in your old age!” Maddingham emptied and refilled his glass.
1086,SEA CONSTABLES,
1087,SEA CONSTABLES,"“We _did_ give you rather a grilling,” said Tegg placidly. “It’s the"
1088,SEA CONSTABLES,national sense of fair play.”
1089,SEA CONSTABLES,
1090,SEA CONSTABLES,“I could have stood it all if it hadn’t been for the Neutral. We dined
1091,SEA CONSTABLES,"at the same hotel while this court-martial was going on, and he used"
1092,SEA CONSTABLES,to come over to my table and sympathise with me! He told me that I was
1093,SEA CONSTABLES,"fighting for his ideals and the uplift of democracy, but I must respect"
1094,SEA CONSTABLES,the Law of Nations!”
1095,SEA CONSTABLES,
1096,SEA CONSTABLES,"“And we respected ’em,” said Tegg. “His papers were perfectly correct;"
1097,SEA CONSTABLES,the Court discharged him. We had to consider existing political
1098,SEA CONSTABLES,relations. I _told_ Maddingham so at the hotel and he----”
1099,SEA CONSTABLES,
1100,SEA CONSTABLES,Again Maddingham turned to the others. “I couldn’t make up my mind
1101,SEA CONSTABLES,"about Tegg at the Inquiry,” he explained. “He had the air of a decent"
1102,SEA CONSTABLES,"sailor-man, but he talked like a poisonous politician.”"
1103,SEA CONSTABLES,
1104,SEA CONSTABLES,"“I was,” Tegg returned. “I had been ordered to change into that rig. So"
1105,SEA CONSTABLES,I changed.”
1106,SEA CONSTABLES,
1107,SEA CONSTABLES,Maddingham ran one fat square hand through his crisped hair and looked
1108,SEA CONSTABLES,"up under his eyebrows like a shy child, while the others lay back and"
1109,SEA CONSTABLES,laughed.
1110,SEA CONSTABLES,
1111,SEA CONSTABLES,"“I suppose I ought to have been on to the joke,” he stammered, “but I’d"
1112,SEA CONSTABLES,blacked myself all over for the part of Lootenant-Commander R.N.V.R. in
1113,SEA CONSTABLES,"time of war, and I’d given up thinking as a banker. If it had been put"
1114,SEA CONSTABLES,before me as a business proposition I might have done better.”
1115,SEA CONSTABLES,
1116,SEA CONSTABLES,"“I thought you were playing up to me and the judges all the time,” said"
1117,SEA CONSTABLES,Tegg. “I never dreamed you took it seriously.”
1118,SEA CONSTABLES,
1119,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Well, I’ve been trained to look on the law as serious. I’ve had to pay"
1120,SEA CONSTABLES,"for some of it in my time, you know.”"
1121,SEA CONSTABLES,
1122,SEA CONSTABLES,"“I’m sorry,” said Tegg. “We were obliged to let that oily beggar"
1123,SEA CONSTABLES,"go--for reasons, but, as I told Maddingham, the night the award was"
1124,SEA CONSTABLES,"given, _his_ duty was to see that he was properly directed to Antigua.”"
1125,SEA CONSTABLES,
1126,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Naturally,” Portson observed. “That being the Neutral’s declared"
1127,SEA CONSTABLES,"destination. And what did Maddingham do? Shut up, Maddingham!”"
1128,SEA CONSTABLES,
1129,SEA CONSTABLES,"Said Tegg, with downcast eyes: “Maddingham took my hand and squeezed"
1130,SEA CONSTABLES,"it; he looked lovingly into my eyes (he _did_!); he turned plum-colour,"
1131,SEA CONSTABLES,and he said: ‘I will’--just like a bridegroom at the altar. It makes me
1132,SEA CONSTABLES,feel shy to think of it even now. I didn’t see him after that till the
1133,SEA CONSTABLES,"evening when _Hilarity_ was pulling out of the Basin, and Maddingham"
1134,SEA CONSTABLES,was cursing the tug-master.”
1135,SEA CONSTABLES,
1136,SEA CONSTABLES,"“I was in a hurry,” said Maddingham. “I wanted to get to the Narrows"
1137,SEA CONSTABLES,and wait for my Neutral there. I dropped down to Biller and Grove’s
1138,SEA CONSTABLES,yard that tide (they’ve done all my work for years) and I jammed
1139,SEA CONSTABLES,"_Hilarity_ into the creek behind their slip, so the Newt didn’t spot me"
1140,SEA CONSTABLES,when he came down the river. Then I pulled out and followed him over
1141,SEA CONSTABLES,the Bar. He stood nor-west at once. I let him go till we were well out
1142,SEA CONSTABLES,"of sight of land. Then I overhauled him, gave him a gun across the bows"
1143,SEA CONSTABLES,"and ran alongside. I’d just had my lunch, and I wasn’t going to lose my"
1144,SEA CONSTABLES,"temper _this_ time. I said: ‘Excuse me, but I understand you are bound"
1145,SEA CONSTABLES,"for Antigua?’ He was, he said, and as he seemed a little nervous about"
1146,SEA CONSTABLES,"my falling aboard him in that swell, I gave _Hilarity_ another sheer"
1147,SEA CONSTABLES,in--she’s as handy as a launch--and I said: ‘May I suggest that this is
1148,SEA CONSTABLES,"not the course for Antigua?’ By that time he had his fenders overside,"
1149,SEA CONSTABLES,and all hands yelling at me to keep away. I snatched _Hilarity_ out
1150,SEA CONSTABLES,and began edging in again. He said: ‘I’m trying a sample of inferior
1151,SEA CONSTABLES,oil that I have my doubts about. If it works all right I shall lay my
1152,SEA CONSTABLES,"course for Antigua, but it will take some time to test the stuff and"
1153,SEA CONSTABLES,"adjust the engines to it.’ I said: ‘Very good, let me know if I can be"
1154,SEA CONSTABLES,"of any service,’ and I offered him _Hilarity_ again once or twice--he"
1155,SEA CONSTABLES,didn’t want her--and then I dropped behind and let him go on. Wasn’t
1156,SEA CONSTABLES,"that proper, Portson?”"
1157,SEA CONSTABLES,
1158,SEA CONSTABLES,"Portson nodded. “I know that game of yours with _Hilarity_,” he said."
1159,SEA CONSTABLES,“How the deuce do you do it? My nerve always goes at close quarters in
1160,SEA CONSTABLES,any sea.”
1161,SEA CONSTABLES,
1162,SEA CONSTABLES,"“It’s only a little trick of steering,” Maddingham replied with a"
1163,SEA CONSTABLES,simper of vanity. “You can almost shave with her when she feels like
1164,SEA CONSTABLES,"it. I had to do it again that same evening, to establish a moral"
1165,SEA CONSTABLES,"ascendancy. He wasn’t showing any lights, and I nearly tripped over"
1166,SEA CONSTABLES,"him. He was a scared Neutral for three minutes, but I got a little"
1167,SEA CONSTABLES,of my own back for that damned court-martial. _But_ I was perfectly
1168,SEA CONSTABLES,polite. I apologised profusely. I didn’t even ask him to show his
1169,SEA CONSTABLES,lights.”
1170,SEA CONSTABLES,
1171,SEA CONSTABLES,“But did he?” said Winchmore.
1172,SEA CONSTABLES,
1173,SEA CONSTABLES,"“He did--every one; and a flare now and then,” Maddingham replied. “He"
1174,SEA CONSTABLES,"held north all that night, with a falling barometer and a rising wind"
1175,SEA CONSTABLES,"and all the other filthy things. Gad, how I hated him! Next morning"
1176,SEA CONSTABLES,"we got it, good and tight from the nor-nor-west out of the Atlantic,"
1177,SEA CONSTABLES,"off Carso Head. He dodged into a squall, and then he went about. We"
1178,SEA CONSTABLES,"weren’t a mile behind, but it was as thick as a wall. When it cleared,"
1179,SEA CONSTABLES,"and I couldn’t see him ahead of me, I went about too, and followed the"
1180,SEA CONSTABLES,"rain. I picked him up five miles down wind, legging it for all he was"
1181,SEA CONSTABLES,"worth to the south’ard--nine knots, I should think. _Hilarity_ doesn’t"
1182,SEA CONSTABLES,"like a following sea. We got pooped a bit, but by noon we’d struggled"
1183,SEA CONSTABLES,back to where we ought to have been--two cables astern of him. Then
1184,SEA CONSTABLES,"he began to signal, but his flags being end-on to us, of course, we"
1185,SEA CONSTABLES,had to creep up on his beam--well abeam--to read ’em. _That_ didn’t
1186,SEA CONSTABLES,restore his morale either. He made out he’d been compelled to put back
1187,SEA CONSTABLES,by stress of weather before completing his oil tests. I made back I was
1188,SEA CONSTABLES,"sorry to hear it, but would be greatly interested in the results. Then"
1189,SEA CONSTABLES,I turned in (I’d been up all night) and my lootenant took on. He was
1190,SEA CONSTABLES,"a widower (by the way) of the name of Sherrin, aged forty-seven. He’d"
1191,SEA CONSTABLES,run a girls’ school at Weston-super-Mare after he’d left the Service in
1192,SEA CONSTABLES,"’ninety-five, and he believed the English were the Lost Tribes.”"
1193,SEA CONSTABLES,
1194,SEA CONSTABLES,“What about the Germans?” said Portson.
1195,SEA CONSTABLES,
1196,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Oh, they’d been misled by Austria, who was the Beast with Horns in"
1197,SEA CONSTABLES,Revelations. Otherwise he was rather a dull dog. He set the tops’ls
1198,SEA CONSTABLES,"in his watch. _Hilarity_ won’t steer under any canvas, so we rather"
1199,SEA CONSTABLES,"sported round our friend that afternoon, I believe. When I came up"
1200,SEA CONSTABLES,"after dinner, she was biting his behind, first one side, then the"
1201,SEA CONSTABLES,other. Let’s see--that would be about thirty miles east-sou-east of
1202,SEA CONSTABLES,Harry Island. We were running as near as nothing south. The wind
1203,SEA CONSTABLES,"had dropped, and there was a useful cross-rip coming up from the"
1204,SEA CONSTABLES,"south-east. I took the wheel and, the way I nursed him from starboard,"
1205,SEA CONSTABLES,he had to take the sea over his port bow. I had my sciatica on
1206,SEA CONSTABLES,me--buccaneering’s no game for a middle-aged man--but I gave that
1207,SEA CONSTABLES,fellow sprudel! By Jove; I washed him out! He stood it as long as he
1208,SEA CONSTABLES,"could, and then he made a bolt for Harry Island. I had to ride in his"
1209,SEA CONSTABLES,pocket most of the way there because I didn’t know that coast. We
1210,SEA CONSTABLES,"had charts, but Sherrin never understood ’em, and I couldn’t leave"
1211,SEA CONSTABLES,"the wheel. So we rubbed along together, and about midnight this Newt"
1212,SEA CONSTABLES,"dodged in over the tail of Harry Shoals and anchored, if you please,"
1213,SEA CONSTABLES,"in the lee of the Double Ricks. It was dead calm there, except for the"
1214,SEA CONSTABLES,"swell, but there wasn’t much room to manœuvre in, and _I_ wasn’t going"
1215,SEA CONSTABLES,"to anchor. It looked too like a submarine rendezvous. But first, I"
1216,SEA CONSTABLES,came alongside and asked him what his trouble was. He told me he had
1217,SEA CONSTABLES,overheated his something-or-other bulb. I’ve never been shipmates with
1218,SEA CONSTABLES,"Diesel engines, but I took his word for it, and I said I ’ud stand by"
1219,SEA CONSTABLES,till it cooled. Then he told me to go to hell.”
1220,SEA CONSTABLES,
1221,SEA CONSTABLES,"“If you were inside the Double Ricks in the dark, you were practically"
1222,SEA CONSTABLES,"there,” said Portson."
1223,SEA CONSTABLES,
1224,SEA CONSTABLES,"“That’s what _I_ thought. I was on the bridge, rabid with sciatica,"
1225,SEA CONSTABLES,going round and round like a circus-horse in about three acres of
1226,SEA CONSTABLES,"water, and wondering when I’d hit something. Ridiculous position."
1227,SEA CONSTABLES,Sherrin saw it. He saved me. He said it was an ideal place for
1228,SEA CONSTABLES,"submarine attacks, and we’d better begin to repel ’em at once. As I"
1229,SEA CONSTABLES,"said, I couldn’t leave the wheel, so Sherrin fought the ship--both"
1230,SEA CONSTABLES,quick-firers and the maxims. He tipped ’em well down into the sea or
1231,SEA CONSTABLES,well up at the Ricks as we went round and round. We made rather a row;
1232,SEA CONSTABLES,and the row the gulls made when we woke ’em was absolutely terrifying.
1233,SEA CONSTABLES,’Give you my word!”
1234,SEA CONSTABLES,
1235,SEA CONSTABLES,“And then?” said Winchmore.
1236,SEA CONSTABLES,
1237,SEA CONSTABLES,“I kept on running in circles through this ghastly din. I took one
1238,SEA CONSTABLES,"sheer over towards his stern--I thought I’d cut it too fine, but we"
1239,SEA CONSTABLES,"missed it by inches. Then I heard his capstan busy, and in another"
1240,SEA CONSTABLES,three minutes his anchor was up. He didn’t wait to stow. He hustled
1241,SEA CONSTABLES,out as he was--bulb or no bulb. He passed within ten feet of us (I
1242,SEA CONSTABLES,was waiting to fall in behind him) and he shouted over the rail: ‘You
1243,SEA CONSTABLES,think you’ve got patriotism. All you’ve got is uric acid and rotten
1244,SEA CONSTABLES,spite!’ I expect he was a little bored. I waited till we had cleared
1245,SEA CONSTABLES,"Harry Shoals before I went below, and then I slept till 9 A. M. He was"
1246,SEA CONSTABLES,"heading north this time, and after I’d had breakfast and a smoke I ran"
1247,SEA CONSTABLES,alongside and asked him where he was bound for now. He was wrapped in a
1248,SEA CONSTABLES,"comforter, evidently suffering from a bad cold. I couldn’t quite catch"
1249,SEA CONSTABLES,"what he said, but I let him croak for a few minutes and fell back. At"
1250,SEA CONSTABLES,9 P. M. he turned round and headed south (I was getting to know the
1251,SEA CONSTABLES,Irish Channel by then) and I followed. There was no particular sea
1252,SEA CONSTABLES,"on. It was a little chilly, but as he didn’t hug the coast I hadn’t"
1253,SEA CONSTABLES,to take the wheel. I stayed below most of the night and let Sherrin
1254,SEA CONSTABLES,"suffer. Well, Mr. Newt kept up this game all the next day, dodging up"
1255,SEA CONSTABLES,and down the Irish Channel. And it was infernally dull. He threw up the
1256,SEA CONSTABLES,sponge off Cloone Harbour. That was on Friday morning. He signalled:
1257,SEA CONSTABLES,‘Developed defects in engine-room. Antigua trip abandoned.’ Then he ran
1258,SEA CONSTABLES,into Cloone and tied up at Brady’s Wharf. You know you can’t repair
1259,SEA CONSTABLES,"a dinghy at Cloone! I followed, of course, and berthed behind him."
1260,SEA CONSTABLES,After lunch I thought I’d pay him a call. I wanted to look at his
1261,SEA CONSTABLES,"engines. I don’t understand Diesels, but Hyslop, my engineer, said"
1262,SEA CONSTABLES,"they must have gone round ’em with a hammer, for they were pretty"
1263,SEA CONSTABLES,badly smashed up. Besides that they had offered all their oil to the
1264,SEA CONSTABLES,"Admiralty agent there, and it was being shifted to a tug when I went"
1265,SEA CONSTABLES,aboard him. So I’d done my job. I was just going back to _Hilarity_
1266,SEA CONSTABLES,when his steward said he’d like to see me. He was lying in his cabin
1267,SEA CONSTABLES,breathing pretty loud--wrapped up in rugs and his eyes sticking out
1268,SEA CONSTABLES,"like a rabbit’s. He offered me drinks. I couldn’t accept ’em, of"
1269,SEA CONSTABLES,"course. Then he said: ‘Well, Mr. Maddingham, I’m all in.’ I said I was"
1270,SEA CONSTABLES,glad to hear it. Then he told me he was seriously ill with a sudden
1271,SEA CONSTABLES,"attack of bronchial pneumonia, and he asked me to run him across to"
1272,SEA CONSTABLES,"England to see his doctor in town. I said, of course, that was out of"
1273,SEA CONSTABLES,"the question, _Hilarity_ being a man-of-war in commission. He couldn’t"
1274,SEA CONSTABLES,see it. He asked what had that to do with it? He thought this war was
1275,SEA CONSTABLES,"some sort of joke, and I had to repeat it all over again. He seemed"
1276,SEA CONSTABLES,"rather afraid of dying (it’s no game for a middle-aged man, of course)"
1277,SEA CONSTABLES,and he hoisted himself up on one elbow and began calling me a murderer.
1278,SEA CONSTABLES,I explained to him--perfectly politely--that I wasn’t in this job for
1279,SEA CONSTABLES,"fun. It was business. My orders were to see that he went to Antigua,"
1280,SEA CONSTABLES,"and now that he wasn’t going to Antigua, and had sold his oil to us,"
1281,SEA CONSTABLES,that finished it as far as I was concerned. (Wasn’t that perfectly
1282,SEA CONSTABLES,"correct?) He said: ‘But that finishes me, too. I can’t get any doctor"
1283,SEA CONSTABLES,in this God-forsaken hole. I made sure you’d treat me properly as soon
1284,SEA CONSTABLES,as I surrendered.’ I said there wasn’t any question of surrender. If
1285,SEA CONSTABLES,"he’d been a wounded belligerent, I might have taken him aboard, though"
1286,SEA CONSTABLES,I certainly shouldn’t have gone a yard out of my course to land him
1287,SEA CONSTABLES,"anywhere; but as it was, he was a neutral--altogether outside the"
1288,SEA CONSTABLES,game. You see my point? I tried awfully hard to make him understand it.
1289,SEA CONSTABLES,He went on about his affairs all being at loose ends. He was a rich
1290,SEA CONSTABLES,"man--a million and a quarter, he said--and he wanted to redraft his"
1291,SEA CONSTABLES,will before he died. I told him a good many people were in his position
1292,SEA CONSTABLES,just now--only they weren’t rich. He changed his tack then and appealed
1293,SEA CONSTABLES,"to me on the grounds of our common humanity. ‘Why, if you leave me now,"
1294,SEA CONSTABLES,"Mr. Maddingham,’ he said, ‘you condemn me to death, just as surely as"
1295,SEA CONSTABLES,if you hanged me.’”
1296,SEA CONSTABLES,
1297,SEA CONSTABLES,"“This _is_ interesting,” Portson murmured. “I never imagined you in"
1298,SEA CONSTABLES,"this light before, Maddingham.”"
1299,SEA CONSTABLES,
1300,SEA CONSTABLES,“I was surprised at myself--’give you my word. But I was perfectly
1301,SEA CONSTABLES,"polite. I said to him: ‘Try to be reasonable, sir. If you had got rid"
1302,SEA CONSTABLES,"of your oil where it was wanted, you’d have condemned lots of people to"
1303,SEA CONSTABLES,"death just as surely as if you’d drowned ’em.’ ‘Ah, but I didn’t,’ he"
1304,SEA CONSTABLES,"said. ‘That ought to count in my favour.’ ‘That was no thanks to you,’"
1305,SEA CONSTABLES,"I said. ‘You weren’t given the chance. This is war, sir. If you make up"
1306,SEA CONSTABLES,"your mind to that, you’ll see that the rest follows.’ ‘I didn’t imagine"
1307,SEA CONSTABLES,"you’d take it as seriously as all that,’ he said--and he said it quite"
1308,SEA CONSTABLES,"seriously, too. ‘Show a little consideration. Your side’s bound to win"
1309,SEA CONSTABLES,"anyway.’ I said: ‘Look here! I’m a middle-aged man, and I don’t suppose"
1310,SEA CONSTABLES,"my conscience is any clearer than yours in many respects, but this is"
1311,SEA CONSTABLES,business. I can do nothing for you.’”
1312,SEA CONSTABLES,
1313,SEA CONSTABLES,"“You got that a bit mixed, I think,” said Tegg critically."
1314,SEA CONSTABLES,
1315,SEA CONSTABLES,"“_He_ saw what I was driving at,” Maddingham replied, “and he was"
1316,SEA CONSTABLES,"the only one that mattered for the moment. ‘Then I’m a dead man,"
1317,SEA CONSTABLES,"Mr. Maddingham,’ he said. ‘That’s _your_ business,’ I said. ‘Good"
1318,SEA CONSTABLES,afternoon.’ And I went out.”
1319,SEA CONSTABLES,
1320,SEA CONSTABLES,"“And?” said Winchmore, after some silence."
1321,SEA CONSTABLES,
1322,SEA CONSTABLES,“He died. I saw his flag half-masted next morning.”
1323,SEA CONSTABLES,
1324,SEA CONSTABLES,There was another silence. Henri looked in at the alcove and smiled.
1325,SEA CONSTABLES,Maddingham beckoned to him.
1326,SEA CONSTABLES,
1327,SEA CONSTABLES,“But why didn’t you lend him a hand to settle his private affairs?”
1328,SEA CONSTABLES,said Portson.
1329,SEA CONSTABLES,
1330,SEA CONSTABLES,“Because I wasn’t acting in my private capacity. I’d been on the bridge
1331,SEA CONSTABLES,for three nights and--” Maddingham pulled out his watch--“this time
1332,SEA CONSTABLES,"to-morrow I shall be there again--confound it! Has my car come, Henri?”"
1333,SEA CONSTABLES,
1334,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Yes, Sare Francis. I am sorry.” They all complimented Henri on the"
1335,SEA CONSTABLES,"dinner, and when the compliments were paid he expressed himself still"
1336,SEA CONSTABLES,their debtor. So did the nephew.
1337,SEA CONSTABLES,
1338,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Are you coming with me, Portson?” said Maddingham as he rose heavily."
1339,SEA CONSTABLES,
1340,SEA CONSTABLES,"“No. I’m for Southampton, worse luck! My car ought to be here, too.”"
1341,SEA CONSTABLES,
1342,SEA CONSTABLES,"“I’m for Euston and the frigid calculating North,” said Winchmore with"
1343,SEA CONSTABLES,"a shudder. “One common taxi, please, Henri.”"
1344,SEA CONSTABLES,
1345,SEA CONSTABLES,"Tegg smiled. “I’m supposed to sleep in just now, but if you don’t mind,"
1346,SEA CONSTABLES,"I’d like to come with you as far as Gravesend, Maddingham.”"
1347,SEA CONSTABLES,
1348,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Delighted. There’s a glass all round left still,” said Maddingham."
1349,SEA CONSTABLES,"“Here’s luck! The usual, I suppose? ‘Damnation to all neutrals!’”"

1449,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,I was buying a canary in a birdshop when he first spoke to me and
1450,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,suggested that I should take a less highly coloured bird. “The colour
1451,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"is in the feeding,” said he. “Unless you know how to feed ’em, it goes."

1453,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1454,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,He passed out before I could thank him. He was a middle-aged man with
1455,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"grey hair and a short, dark beard, rather like a Sealyham terrier in"
1456,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,silver spectacles. For some reason his face and his voice stayed in

1458,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"on a platform crowded with an Angling Club going to the Thames, I"

1471,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“Well! Well! And how did the canary do?” said the man behind the

1474,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"His name was Lewis Holroyd Burges, of “Burges and Son,” as I might have"

1480,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,up at all--eh?” (It was then that he told me of Son Lewis’s death and
1481,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,why the boy had been christened Lewis.) “Yes. There’s not much left for
1482,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,middle-aged people just at present. Even one’s hobbies----We used to
1483,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,fish together. And the same with canaries! We used to breed ’em for

1502,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,distance from the door I was accosted by a wounded man who asked for

1584,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"are upset, the more they fly to it. I abhor slovenly Ritual anywhere."
1585,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"By the way, would you mind assisting at the examinations, if there are"
1586,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,many Visiting Brothers to-night? You’ll find some of ’em very rusty
1587,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"but--it’s the Spirit, not the Letter, that giveth life. The question"
1588,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,of Visiting Brethren is an important one. There are so many of them in
1589,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"London now, you see; and so few places where they can meet.”"
1590,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1591,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“You dear thing!” said Mrs. Burges, and handed him his locked and"
1592,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,initialed apron-case.
1593,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1594,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Our Lodge is only just round the corner,” he went on. “You mustn’t be"
1595,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,too critical of our appurtenances. The place was a garage once.”
1596,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1597,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"As far as I could make out in the humiliating darkness, we wandered up"
1598,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"a mews and into a courtyard. Mr. Burges piloted me, murmuring apologies"
1599,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,for everything in advance.
1600,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1601,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“You mustn’t expect----” he was still saying when we stumbled up a
1602,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,porch and entered a carefully decorated ante-room hung round with
1603,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Masonic prints. I noticed Peter Gilkes and Barton Wilson, fathers of"
1604,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Emulation” working, in the place of honour; Kneller’s Christopher"
1605,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Wren; Dunkerley, with his own Fitz-George book-plate below and the bend"
1606,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"sinister on the Royal Arms; Hogarth’s caricature of Wilkes, also his"
1607,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"disreputable “Night”; and a beautifully framed set of Grand Masters,"
1608,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,from Anthony Sayer down.
1609,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1610,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“Are these another hobby of yours?” I asked.
1611,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1612,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Not this time,” Mr. Burges smiled. “We have to thank Brother Lemming"
1613,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"for them.” He introduced me to the senior partner of Lemming and Orton,"
1614,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"whose little shop is hard to find, but whose words and cheques in the"
1615,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,matter of prints are widely circulated.
1616,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1617,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“The frames are the best part of ’em,” said Brother Lemming after my"
1618,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,compliments. “There are some more in the Lodge Room. Come and look.
1619,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,We’ve got the big Desaguliers there that nearly went to Iowa.”
1620,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1621,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,I had never seen a Lodge Room better fitted. From mosaicked floor to
1622,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"appropriate ceiling, from curtain to pillar, implements to seats, seats"
1623,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"to lights, and little carved music-loft at one end, every detail was"
1624,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,perfect in particular kind and general design. I said what I thought of
1625,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"them all, many times over."
1626,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1627,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“I told you I was a Ritualist,” said Mr. Burges. “Look at those carved"
1628,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,corn-sheaves and grapes on the back of these Wardens’ chairs. That’s
1629,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,the old tradition--before Masonic furnishers spoilt it. I picked up
1630,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,that pair in Stepney ten years ago--the same time I got the gavel.”
1631,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"It was of ancient, yellowed ivory, cut all in one piece out of some"
1632,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"tremendous tusk. “That came from the Gold Coast,” he said. “It belonged"
1633,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,to a Military Lodge there in 1794. You can see the inscription.”
1634,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1635,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“If it’s a fair question,” I began, “how much----”"
1636,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1637,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“It stood us,” said Brother Lemming, his thumbs in his waistcoat"
1638,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"pockets, “an appreciable sum of money when we built it in 1906, even"
1639,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,with what Brother Anstruther--he was our contractor--cheated himself
1640,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"out of. By the way, that ashlar there is pure Carrara, he tells me. I"
1641,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"don’t understand marbles myself. Since then I expect we’ve put in--oh,"
1642,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,quite another little sum. Now we’ll go to the examination-room and take
1643,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,on the Brethren.”
1644,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1645,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"He led me back, not to the ante-room, but a convenient chamber flanked"
1646,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,with what looked like confessional-boxes (I found out later that that
1647,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"was what they had been, when first picked up for a song near Oswestry)."
1648,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,A few men in uniform were waiting at the far end. “That’s only the head
1649,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"of the procession. The rest are in the ante-room,” said an officer of"
1650,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,the Lodge.
1651,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1652,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Brother Burges assigned me my discreet box, saying: “Don’t be"
1653,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,surprised. They come all shapes.”
1654,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1655,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Shapes” was not a bad description, for my first penitent was all"
1656,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"head-bandages--escaped from an Officers’ Hospital, Pentonville way."
1657,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,He asked me in profane Scots how I expected a man with only six teeth
1658,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"and half a lower lip to speak to any purpose, so we compromised on the"
1659,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"signs. The next--a New Zealander from Taranaki--reversed the process,"
1660,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"for he was one-armed, and that in a sling. I mistrusted an enormous"
1661,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Sergeant-Major of Heavy Artillery, who struck me as much too glib, so"
1662,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"I sent him on to Brother Lemming in the next box, who discovered he"
1663,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,was a Past District Grand Officer. My last man nearly broke me down
1664,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,altogether. Everything seemed to have gone from him.
1665,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1666,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“I don’t blame yer,” he gulped at last. “I wouldn’t pass my own self"
1667,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"on my answers, but I give yer my word that so far as I’ve had any"
1668,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"religion, it’s been all the religion I’ve had. For God’s sake, let me"
1669,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"sit in Lodge again, Brother!”"
1670,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1671,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"When the examinations were ended, a Lodge Officer came round with"
1672,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"our aprons--no tinsel or silver-gilt confections, but heavily-corded"
1673,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,silk with tassels and--where a man could prove he was entitled to
1674,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"them--levels, of decent plate. Some one in front of me tightened a"
1675,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,belt on a stiffly silent person in civil clothes with discharge-badge.
1676,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“’Strewth! This is comfort again,” I heard him say. The companion"
1677,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,nodded. The man went on suddenly: “Here! What’re you doing? Leave off!
1678,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,You promised not to! Chuck it!” and dabbed at his companion’s streaming
1679,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,eyes.
1680,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1681,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Let him leak,” said an Australian signaller. “Can’t you see how happy"
1682,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,the beggar is?”
1683,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1684,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,It appeared that the silent Brother was a “shell-shocker” whom Brother
1685,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Lemming had passed, on the guarantee of his friend and--what moved"
1686,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Lemming more--the threat that, were he refused, he would have fits from"
1687,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,pure disappointment. So the “shocker” went happily and silently among
1688,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Brethren evidently accustomed to these displays.
1689,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1690,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"We fell in, two by two, according to tradition, fifty of us at least,"
1691,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"and were played into Lodge by what I thought was an harmonium, but"
1692,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,which I discovered to be an organ of repute. It took time to settle us
1693,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"down, for ten or twelve were cripples and had to be helped into long or"
1694,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,easy chairs. I sat between a one-footed R.A.M.C. Corporal and a Captain
1695,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"of Territorials, who, he told me, had “had a brawl” with a bomb, which"
1696,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,had bent him in two directions. “But that’s first-class Bach the
1697,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"organist is giving us now,” he said delightedly. “I’d like to know him."
1698,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,_I_ used to be a piano-thumper of sorts.”
1699,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1700,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“I’ll introduce you after Lodge,” said one of the regular Brethren"
1701,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"behind us--a plump, torpedo-bearded man, who turned out to be a doctor."
1702,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“After all, there’s nobody to touch Bach, is there?” Those two plunged"
1703,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"at once into musical talk, which to outsiders is as fascinating as"
1704,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,trigonometry.
1705,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1706,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Now a Lodge of Instruction is mainly a parade-ground for Ritual. It
1707,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"cannot initiate or confer degrees, but is limited to rehearsals and"
1708,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"lectures. Worshipful Brother Burges, resplendent in Solomon’s Chair (I"
1709,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"found out later where that, too, had been picked up), briefly told the"
1710,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Visiting Brethren how welcome they were and always would be, and asked"
1711,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,them to vote what ceremony should be rendered for their instruction.
1712,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1713,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,When the decision was announced he wanted to know whether any Visiting
1714,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Brothers would take the duties of Lodge Officers. They protested
1715,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"bashfully that they were too rusty. “The very reason why,” said Brother"
1716,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Burges, while the organ Bached softly. My musical Captain wriggled in"
1717,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,his chair.
1718,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1719,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“One moment, Worshipful Sir.” The plump Doctor rose. “We have here a"
1720,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"musician for whom place and opportunity are needed. Only,” he went on"
1721,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"colloquially, “those organ-loft steps are a bit steep.”"
1722,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1723,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“How much,” said Brother Burges with the solemnity of an initiation,"
1724,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“does our Brother weigh?”
1725,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1726,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Very little over eight stone,” said the Brother. “Weighed this"
1727,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"morning, Worshipful Sir.”"
1728,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1729,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"The Past District Grand Officer, who was also a Battery-Sergeant-Major,"
1730,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"waddled across, lifted the slight weight in his arms and bore it to the"
1731,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"loft, where, the regular organist pumping, it played joyously as a soul"
1732,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,caught up to Heaven by surprise.
1733,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1734,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"When the visitors had been coaxed to supply the necessary officers,"
1735,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,a ceremony was rehearsed. Brother Burges forbade the regular members
1736,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"to prompt. The visitors had to work entirely by themselves, but, on"
1737,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"the Battery-Sergeant-Major taking a hand, he was ruled out as of too"
1738,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,exalted rank. They floundered badly after that support was withdrawn.
1739,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1740,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,The one-footed R.A.M.C. on my right chuckled.
1741,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1742,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“D’you like it?” said the Doctor to him.
1743,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1744,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“_Do_ I? It’s Heaven to me, sittin’ in Lodge again, It’s all comin’"
1745,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"back now, watching their mistakes. I haven’t much religion, but all I"
1746,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"had I learnt in Lodge.” Recognising me, he flushed a little as one does"
1747,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"when one says a thing twice over in another’s hearing. “Yes, ’veiled in"
1748,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"all’gory and illustrated in symbols’--the Fatherhood of God, an’ the"
1749,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Brotherhood of Man; an’ what more in Hell _do_ you want?... Look at
1750,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,’em!” He broke off giggling. “See! See! They’ve tied the whole thing
1751,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,into knots. _I_ could ha’ done it better myself--my one foot in France.
1752,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Yes, I should think they _ought_ to do it again!”"
1753,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1754,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,The new organist covered the little confusion that had arisen with what
1755,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,sounded like the wings of angels.
1756,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1757,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"When the amateurs, rather red and hot, had finished, they demanded an"
1758,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,exhibition-working of their bungled ceremony by Regular Brethren of the
1759,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Lodge. Then I realised for the first time what word-and-gesture-perfect
1760,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Ritual can be brought to mean. We all applauded, the one-footed"
1761,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Corporal most of all.
1762,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1763,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“We _are_ rather proud of our working, and this is an audience worth"
1764,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"playing up to,” the Doctor said."
1765,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1766,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Next the Master delivered a little lecture on the meanings of some
1767,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"pictured symbols and diagrams. His theme was a well-worn one, but his"
1768,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,deep holding voice made it fresh.
1769,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1770,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Marvellous how these old copybook-headings persist,” the Doctor said."
1771,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1772,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“_That’s_ all right!” the one-footed man spoke cautiously out of
1773,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,the side of his mouth like a boy in form. “But they’re the kind o’
1774,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,copybook-headin’s we shall find burnin’ round our bunks in Hell.
1775,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Believe me-ee! I’ve broke enough of ’em to know. Now, h’sh!” He leaned"
1776,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"forward, drinking it all in."
1777,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1778,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Presently Brother Burges touched on a point which had given rise to
1779,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"some diversity of Ritual. He asked for information. “Well, in Jamaica,"
1780,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Worshipful Sir,” a Visiting Brother began, and explained how they"
1781,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,worked that detail in his parts. Another and another joined in from
1782,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"different quarters of the Lodge (and the world), and when they were"
1783,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"well warmed the Doctor sidled softly round the walls and, over our"
1784,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"shoulders, passed us cigarettes."
1785,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1786,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“A shocking innovation,” he said, as he returned to the"
1787,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Captain-musician’s vacant seat on my left. “But men can’t really talk
1788,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"without tobacco, and we’re only a Lodge of Instruction.”"
1789,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1790,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“An’ I’ve learned more in one evenin’ here than ten years.” The
1791,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"one-footed man turned round for an instant from a dark, sour-looking"
1792,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Yeoman in spurs who was laying down the law on Dutch Ritual. The blue
1793,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"haze and the talk increased, while the organ from the loft blessed us"
1794,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,all.
1795,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1796,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“But this is delightful,” said I to the Doctor. “How did it all happen?”"
1797,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1798,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“Brother Burges started it. He used to talk to the men who dropped
1799,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,into his shop when the war began. He told us sleepy old chaps in Lodge
1800,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,that what men wanted more than anything else was Lodges where they
1801,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,could sit--just sit and be happy like we are now. He was right too.
1802,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,We’re learning things in the war. A man’s Lodge means more to him than
1803,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"people imagine. As our friend on your right said just now, very often"
1804,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Masonry’s the only practical creed we’ve ever listened to since we were
1805,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"children. Platitudes or no platitudes, it squares with what everybody"
1806,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,knows ought to be done.” He sighed. “And if this war hasn’t brought
1807,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"home the Brotherhood of Man to us all, I’m--a Hun!”"
1808,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1809,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“How did you get your visitors?” I went on.
1810,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1811,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Oh, I told a few fellows in hospital near here, at Burges’s"
1812,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"suggestion, that we had a Lodge of Instruction and they’d be welcome."
1813,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,And they came. And they told their friends. And _they_ came! That was
1814,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"two years ago!--and now we’ve Lodge of Instruction two nights a week,"
1815,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,and a matinée nearly every Tuesday and Friday for the men who can’t get
1816,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"evening leave. Yes, it’s all very curious. I’d no notion what the Craft"
1817,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,meant--and means--till this war.”
1818,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1819,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Nor I, till this evening,” I replied."
1820,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1821,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“Yet it’s quite natural if you think. Here’s London--all
1822,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"England--packed with the Craft from all over the world, and nowhere"
1823,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"for them to go. Why, our weekly visiting attendance for the last four"
1824,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,months averaged just under a hundred and forty. Divide by four--call
1825,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"it thirty-five Visiting Brethren a time. Our record’s seventy-one, but"
1826,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,we have packed in as many as eighty-four at Banquets. You can see for
1827,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,yourself what a potty little hole we are!”
1828,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1829,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“Banquets too!” I cried. “It must cost like anything. May the Visiting
1830,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Brethren----”
1831,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1832,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"The Doctor--his name was Keede--laughed. “No, a Visiting Brother may"
1833,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,_not_.”
1834,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1835,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“But when a man has had an evening like this, he wants to----”"
1836,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1837,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“That’s what they all say. That makes our difficulty. They do exactly
1838,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"what you were going to suggest, and they’re offended if we don’t take"
1839,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,it.”
1840,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1841,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“Don’t you?” I asked.
1842,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1843,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“My dear man--what _does_ it come to? They can’t all stay to Banquet.
1844,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Say one hundred suppers a week--fifteen quid--sixty a month--seven
1845,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,hundred and twenty a year. How much are Lemming and Orton worth? And
1846,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Ellis and McKnight--that long big man over yonder--the provision
1847,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,dealers? How much d’you suppose could Burges write a cheque for and
1848,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,not feel? ’Tisn’t as if he had to save for any one now. I assure you
1849,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,we have no scruple in calling on the Visiting Brethren when we want
1850,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,anything. We couldn’t do the work otherwise. Have you noticed how the
1851,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Lodge is kept--brass-work, jewels, furniture, and so on?”"
1852,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1853,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“I have indeed,” I said. “It’s like a ship. You could eat your dinner"
1854,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,off the floor.”
1855,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1856,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Well, come here on a bye-day and you’ll often find half-a-dozen"
1857,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Brethren, with eight legs between ’em, polishing and ronuking and"
1858,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,sweeping everything they can get at. I cured a shell-shocker this
1859,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,spring by giving him our jewels to look after. He pretty well polished
1860,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"the numbers off ’em, but--it kept him from fighting Huns in his sleep."
1861,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,And when we need Masters to take our duties--two matinées a week is
1862,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,rather a tax--we’ve the choice of P.M.’s from all over the world. The
1863,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Dominions are much keener on Ritual than an average English Lodge.
1864,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Besides that----Oh, we’re going to adjourn. Listen to the greetings."
1865,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,They’ll be interesting.”
1866,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1867,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"The crack of the great gavel brought us to our feet, after some surging"
1868,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"and plunging among the cripples. Then the Battery-Sergeant-Major, in"
1869,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"a trained voice, delivered hearty and fraternal greetings to “Faith"
1870,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"and Works” from his tropical District and Lodge. The others followed,"
1871,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"without order, in every tone between a grunt and a squeak. I heard"
1872,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Hauraki,” “Inyanga-Umbezi,” “Aloha,” “Southern Lights” (from somewhere"
1873,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Punta Arenas way), “Lodge of Rough Ashlars” (and that Newfoundland"
1874,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Naval Brother looked it), two or three Stars of something or other,"
1875,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"half-a-dozen cardinal virtues, variously arranged, hailing from"
1876,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Klondyke to Kalgoorlie, one Military Lodge on one of the fronts, thrown"
1877,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"in with a severe Scots burr by my friend of the head-bandages, and the"
1878,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,rest as mixed as the Empire itself. Just at the end there was a little
1879,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,stir. The silent Brother had begun to make noises; his companion tried
1880,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,to soothe him.
1881,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1882,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“Let him be! Let him be!” the Doctor called professionally. The man
1883,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"jerked and mouthed, and at last mumbled something unintelligible even"
1884,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"to his friend, but a small dark P.M. pushed forward importantly."
1885,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1886,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“It iss all right,” he said. “He wants to say----” he spat out some"
1887,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"yard-long Welsh name, adding, “That means Pembroke Docks, Worshipful"
1888,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Sir. We haf good Masons in Wales, too.” The silent man nodded approval."
1889,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1890,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Yes,” said the Doctor, quite unmoved. “It happens that way sometimes."
1891,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"_Hespere panta fereis_, isn’t it? The Star brings ’em all home. I must"
1892,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,get a note of that fellow’s case after Lodge. I saw you didn’t care for
1893,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"music,” he went on, “but I’m afraid you’ll have to put up with a little"
1894,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,more. It’s a paraphrase from Micah. Our organist arranged it. We sing
1895,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"it antiphonally, as a sort of dismissal.”"
1896,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1897,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Even I could appreciate what followed. The singing seemed confined to
1898,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"half-a-dozen trained voices answering each other till the last line,"
1899,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,when the full Lodge came in. I give it as I heard it:
1900,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1901,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“We have showed thee, O Man,"
1902,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,What is good.
1903,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,What doth the Lord require of us?
1904,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Or Conscience’ self desire of us?
1905,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,But to do justly--
1906,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"But to love mercy,"
1907,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"And to walk humbly with our God,"
1908,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,As every Mason should.”
1909,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1910,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Then we were played and sung out to the quaint tune of the “Entered
1911,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Apprentices’ Song.” I noticed that the regular Brethren of the Lodge
1912,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,did not begin to take off their regalia till the lines:
1913,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1914,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Great Kings, Dukes, and Lords"
1915,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Have laid down their swords.”
1916,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1917,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"They moved into the ante-room, now set for the Banquet, on the verse:"
1918,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1919,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“Antiquity’s pride
1920,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"We have on our side,"
1921,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Which maketh men just in their station.”
1922,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1923,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,The Brother (a big-boned clergyman) that I found myself next to at
1924,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,table told me the custom was “a fond thing vainly invented” on the
1925,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,strength of some old legend. He laid down that Masonry should be
1926,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,regarded as an “intellectual abstraction.” An Officer of Engineers
1927,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"disagreed with him, and told us how in Flanders, a year before, some"
1928,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,ten or twelve Brethren held Lodge in what was left of a Church. Save
1929,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"for the Emblems of Mortality and plenty of rough ashlars, there was no"
1930,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,furniture.
1931,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1932,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“I warrant you weren’t a bit the worse for that,” said the Clergyman."
1933,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“The idea should be enough without trappings.”
1934,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1935,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“But it wasn’t,” said the other. “We took a lot of trouble to make our"
1936,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"regalia out of camouflage-stuff that we’d pinched, and we manufactured"
1937,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,our jewels from old metal. I’ve got the set now. It kept us happy for
1938,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,weeks.”
1939,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1940,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“Ye were absolutely irregular an’ unauthorised. Whaur was your
1941,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Warrant?” said the Brother from the Military Lodge. “Grand Lodge ought
1942,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,to take steps against----”
1943,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1944,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“If Grand Lodge had any sense,” a private three places up our table"
1945,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"broke in, “it ’ud warrant travelling Lodges at the front and attach"
1946,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,first-class lecturers to ’em.”
1947,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1948,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“Wad ye confer degrees promiscuously?” said the scandalised Scot.
1949,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1950,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Every time a man asked, of course. You’d have half the Army in.”"
1951,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1952,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"The speaker played with the idea for a little while, and proved that,"
1953,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"on the lowest scale of fees, Grand Lodge would get huge revenues."
1954,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1955,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“I believe,” said the Engineer Officer thoughtfully, “I could design a"
1956,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,complete travelling Lodge outfit under forty pounds weight.”
1957,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1958,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Ye’re wrong. I’ll prove it. We’ve tried ourselves,” said the Military"
1959,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Lodge man; and they went at it together across the table, each with his"
1960,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,own note-book.
1961,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1962,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,The “Banquet” was simplicity itself. Many of us ate in haste so as to
1963,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"get back to barracks or hospitals, but now and again a Brother came in"
1964,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,from the outer darkness to fill a chair and empty a plate. These were
1965,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Brethren who had been there before and needed no examination.
1966,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1967,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"One man lurched in--helmet, Flanders mud, accoutrements and all--fresh"
1968,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,from the leave-train.
1969,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1970,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“’Got two hours to wait for my train,” he explained. “I remembered your"
1971,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"night, though. My God, this is good!”"
1972,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1973,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“What is your train and from what station?” said the Clergyman
1974,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,precisely. “Very well. What will you have to eat?”
1975,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1976,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“Anything. Everything. I’ve thrown up a month’s rations in the Channel.”
1977,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1978,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"He stoked himself for ten minutes without a word. Then, without a word,"
1979,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,his face fell forward. The Clergyman had him by one already limp arm
1980,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"and steered him to a couch, where he dropped and snored. No one took"
1981,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,the trouble to turn around.
1982,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1983,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“Is that usual too?” I asked.
1984,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1985,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“Why not?” said the Clergyman. “I’m on duty to-night to wake them
1986,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,for their trains. They do not respect the Cloth on those occasions.”
1987,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,He turned his broad back on me and continued his discussion with a
1988,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Brother from Aberdeen by way of Mitylene where, in the intervals of"
1989,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"mine-sweeping, he had evolved a complete theory of the Revelations of"
1990,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,St. John the Divine in the Island of Patmos.
1991,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
1992,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,I fell into the hands of a Sergeant-Instructor of Machine Guns--by
1993,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,profession a designer of ladies’ dresses. He told me that Englishwomen
1994,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"as a class “lose on their corsets what they make on their clothes,”"
1995,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,and that “Satan himself can’t save a woman who wears thirty-shilling
1996,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"corsets under a thirty-guinea costume.” Here, to my grief, he was"
1997,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"buttonholed by a zealous Lieutenant of his own branch, and became a"
1998,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Sergeant again all in one click.
1999,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2000,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"I drifted back and forth, studying the prints on the walls and the"
2001,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Masonic collection in the cases, while I listened to the inconceivable"
2002,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"talk all round me. Little by little the company thinned, till at last"
2003,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,there were only a dozen or so of us left. We gathered at the end of a
2004,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"table near the fire, the night-bird from Flanders trumpeting lustily"
2005,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"into the hollow of his helmet, which some one had tipped over his face."
2006,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2007,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“And how did it go with you?” said the Doctor.
2008,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2009,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“It was like a new world,” I answered."
2010,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2011,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“That’s what it _is_ really.” Brother Burges returned the gold
2012,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,pince-nez to their case and reshipped his silver spectacles. “Or that’s
2013,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,what it might be made with a little trouble. When I think of the
2014,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,possibilities of the Craft at this juncture I wonder----” He stared
2015,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,into the fire.
2016,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2017,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“I wonder, too,” said the Sergeant-Major slowly, “but--on the"
2018,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,whole--I’m inclined to agree with you. We could do much with Masonry.”
2019,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2020,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“As an aid--as an aid--not as a substitute for Religion,” the Clergyman"
2021,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,snapped.
2022,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2023,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Oh, Lord! Can’t we give Religion a rest for a bit,” the Doctor"
2024,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,muttered. “It hasn’t done so--I beg your pardon all around.”
2025,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2026,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,The Clergyman was bristling. “Kamerad!” the wise Sergeant-Major went
2027,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"on, both hands up. “Certainly not as a substitute for a creed, but as"
2028,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,an average plan of life. What I’ve seen at the front makes me sure of
2029,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,it.”
2030,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2031,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Brother Burges came out of his muse. “There ought to be a
2032,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,dozen--twenty--other Lodges in London every night; conferring degrees
2033,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"too, as well as instruction. Why shouldn’t the young men join? They"
2034,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,practise what we’re always preaching. Well! Well! We must all do what
2035,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,we can. What’s the use of old Masons if they can’t give a little help
2036,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,along their own lines?”
2037,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2038,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Exactly,” said the Sergeant-Major, turning on the Doctor. “And what’s"
2039,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,the darn use of a Brother if he isn’t allowed to help?”
2040,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2041,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Have it your own way then,” said the Doctor testily. He had evidently"
2042,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,been approached before. He took something the Sergeant-Major handed to
2043,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"him and pocketed it with a nod. “I was wrong,” he said to me, “when I"
2044,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"boasted of our independence. They get round us sometimes. This,” he"
2045,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"slapped his pocket, “will give a banquet on Tuesday. We don’t usually"
2046,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"feed at matinées. It will be a surprise. By the way, try another"
2047,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,sandwich. The ham are best.” He pushed me a plate.
2048,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2049,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“They are,” I said. “I’ve only had five or six. I’ve been looking for"
2050,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,them.”
2051,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2052,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“’Glad you like them,” said Brother Lemming. “Fed him myself, cured"
2053,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,him myself--at my little place in Berkshire. His name was Charlemagne.
2054,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"By the way, Doc, am I to keep another one for next month?”"
2055,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2056,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Of course,” said the Doctor with his mouth full. “A little fatter than"
2057,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"this chap, please. And don’t forget your promise about the pickled"
2058,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,nasturtiums. They’re appreciated.” Brother Lemming nodded above the
2059,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"pipe he had lit as we began a second supper. Suddenly the Clergyman,"
2060,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"after a glance at the clock, scooped up half-a-dozen sandwiches"
2061,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"from under my nose, put them into an oiled paper bag, and advanced"
2062,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,cautiously towards the sleeper on the couch.
2063,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2064,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“They wake rough sometimes,” said the Doctor. “Nerves, y’know.” The"
2065,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Clergyman tip-toed directly behind the man’s head, and at arm’s length"
2066,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"rapped on the dome of the helmet. The man woke in one vivid streak, as"
2067,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"the Clergyman stepped back, and grabbed for a rifle that was not there."
2068,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2069,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“You’ve barely half an hour to catch your train.” The Clergyman passed
2070,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,him the sandwiches. “Come along.”
2071,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2072,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“You’re uncommonly kind and I’m very grateful,” said the man, wriggling"
2073,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,into his stiff straps. He followed his guide into the darkness after
2074,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,saluting.
2075,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2076,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“Who’s that?” said Lemming.
2077,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2078,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“’Can’t say,” the Doctor returned indifferently. “He’s been here"
2079,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,before. He’s evidently a P.M. of sorts.”
2080,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2081,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Well! Well!” said Brother Burges, whose eyelids were drooping. “We"
2082,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,must all do what we can. Isn’t it almost time to lock up?”
2083,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2084,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“I wonder,” said I, as we helped each other into our coats, “what would"
2085,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,happen if Grand Lodge knew about all this.”
2086,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2087,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“About what?” Lemming turned on me quickly.
2088,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2089,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,“A Lodge of Instruction open three nights and two afternoons a
2090,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"week--and running a lodging-house as well. It’s all very nice, but it"
2091,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,doesn’t strike me somehow as regulation.”
2092,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2093,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“The point hasn’t been raised yet,” said Lemming. “We’ll settle it"
2094,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,after the war. Meantime we shall go on.”
2095,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2096,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“There ought to be scores of them,” Brother Burges repeated as we went"
2097,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"out of the door. “All London’s full of the Craft, and no places for"
2098,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,them to meet in. Think of the possibilities of it! Think what could
2099,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,have been done _by_ Masonry _through_ Masonry _for_ all the world. I
2100,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"hope I’m not censorious, but it sometimes crosses my mind that Grand"
2101,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Lodge may have thrown away its chance in the war almost as much as the
2102,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Church has.”
2103,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2104,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“’Lucky for you the Padre is taking that chap to King’s Cross,” said"
2105,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"Brother Lemming, “or he’d be down your throat. What really troubles him"
2106,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,is our legal position under Masonic Law. I think he’ll inform on us one
2107,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"of these days. Well, good night, all.” The Doctor and Lemming turned"
2108,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,off together.
2109,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2110,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,"“Yes,” said Brother Burges, slipping his arm into mine. “Almost as much"
2111,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,as the Church has. But perhaps I’m too much of a Ritualist.”
2112,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,
2113,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,I said nothing. I was speculating how soon I could steal a march on the
2114,“IN THE INTERESTS OF THE BRETHREN”,Clergyman and inform against “Faith and Works No. 5837 E. C.”

2164,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2165,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,His name was Brownell and his reign was brief. He came from the Central
2166,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Anglican Scholastic Agency, a soured, clever, reddish man picked up"
2167,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,by the Head at the very last moment of the summer holidays in default
2168,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,of Macrea (of Macrea’s House) who wired from Switzerland that he had
2169,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"smashed a knee mountaineering, and would not be available that term."
2170,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2171,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Looking back at the affair, one sees that the Head should have warned"
2172,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Mr. Brownell of the College’s outstanding peculiarity, instead of"
2173,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"leaving him to discover it for himself the first day of the term,"
2174,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"when he went for a walk to the beach, and saw “Potiphar” Mullins,"
2175,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Head of Games, smoking without conceal on the sands. “Pot,” having"
2176,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"the whole of the Autumn Football challenges, acceptances, and Fifteen"
2177,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"reconstructions to work out, did not at first comprehend Mr. Brownell’s"
2178,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"shrill cry of: “You’re smoking! You’re smoking, sir!” but he removed"
2179,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"his pipe, and answered, placably enough: “The Army Class is allowed to"
2180,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"smoke, sir.”"
2181,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2182,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Mr. Brownell replied: “Preposterous!”
2183,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2184,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Pot, seeing that this new person was uninformed, suggested that he"
2185,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,should refer to the Head.
2186,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2187,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“You may be sure I shall--sure I shall, sir! Then we shall see!”"
2188,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2189,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Mr. Brownell and his umbrella scudded off, and Pot returned to his"
2190,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"match-plannings. Anon, he observed, much as the Almighty might observe"
2191,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"black-beetles, two small figures coming over the Pebble-ridge a few"
2192,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"hundred yards to his right. They were a Major and his Minor, the"
2193,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"latter a new boy and, as such, entitled to his brother’s countenance"
2194,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,for exactly three days--after which he would fend for himself. Pot
2195,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,waited till they were well out on the great stretch of mother-o’-pearl
2196,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,sands; then caused his ground-ash to describe a magnificent whirl of
2197,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,command in the air.
2198,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2199,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Come on,” said the Major. “Run!”"
2200,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2201,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“What for?” said the Minor, who had noticed nothing."
2202,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2203,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“’Cause we’re wanted. Leg it!”
2204,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2205,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Oh, I can do _that_,” the Minor replied and, at the end of the sprint,"
2206,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"fetched up a couple of yards ahead of his brother, and much less winded."
2207,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2208,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“’Your Minor?” said Pot looking over them, seawards."
2209,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2210,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Yes, Mullins,” the Major replied."
2211,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2212,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“All right. Cut along!” They cut on the word.
2213,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2214,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“Hi! Fludd Major! Come back!”
2215,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2216,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Back fled the elder.
2217,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2218,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“Your wind’s bad. Too fat. You grunt like a pig. Mustn’t do it!
2219,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Understand? Go away!”
2220,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2221,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“What was all that for?” the Minor asked on the Major’s return.
2222,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2223,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“To see if we could run, you fool!”"
2224,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2225,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Well, I ran faster than you, anyhow,” was the scandalous retort."
2226,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2227,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Look here, Har--Minor, if you go on talking like this, you’ll get"
2228,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,yourself kicked all round Coll. An’ you mustn’t stand like you did when
2229,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,a Prefect’s talkin’ to you.”
2230,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2231,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,The Minor’s eyes opened with awe. “I thought it was only one of the
2232,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"masters,” said he."
2233,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2234,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“Masters! It was Mullins--Head o’ Games. You _are_ a putrid young ass!”
2235,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2236,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"By what seemed pure chance, Mr. Brownell ran into the School Chaplain,"
2237,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"the Reverend John Gillette, beating up against the soft, September rain"
2238,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,that no native ever troubled to wear a coat for.
2239,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2240,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“I was trying to catch you after lunch,” the latter began. “I wanted to"
2241,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,show you our objects of local interest.”
2242,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2243,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Thank you! I’ve seen all _I_ want,” Mr. Brownell answered. “Gillette,"
2244,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,_is_ there anything about me which suggests the Congenital Dupe?”
2245,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2246,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“It’s early to say, yet,” the Chaplain answered. “Who’ve you been"
2247,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,meeting?”
2248,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2249,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“A youth called Mullins, I believe.” And, indeed, there was Potiphar,"
2250,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"ground-ash, pipe, and all, quarter-decking serenely below the"
2251,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Pebble-ridge.
2252,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2253,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“Oh! I see. Old Pot--our Head of Games.”
2254,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2255,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“He was smoking. He’s smoking _now_! Before those two little boys,"
2256,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,too!” Mr. Brownell panted. “He had the audacity to tell me that----”
2257,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2258,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Yes,” the Reverend John cut in. “The Army Class is allowed to"
2259,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"smoke--not in their studies, of course, but within limits, out of"
2260,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"doors. You see we have to compete against the Crammers’ establishments,"
2261,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,where smoking’s usual.”
2262,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2263,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"This was true! Of the only school in England was this the cold truth,"
2264,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"and for the reason given, in that unprogressive age."
2265,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2266,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“Good Heavens!” said Mr. Brownell to the gulls and the gray sea. “And I
2267,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,was never warned!”
2268,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2269,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“The Head _is_ a little forgetful. _I_ ought to have----But it’s all
2270,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"right,” the Chaplain added soothingly. “Pot won’t--er--give you away.”"
2271,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2272,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Mr. Brownell, who knew what smoking led to, testified out of his twelve"
2273,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,years’ experience of what he called the Animal Boy. He left little
2274,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,unexplored or unexplained.
2275,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2276,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“There may be something in what you say,” the Reverend John assented."
2277,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“But as a matter of fact, their actual smoking doesn’t amount to much."
2278,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"They talk a great deal about their brands of tobacco. Practically, it"
2279,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,makes them rather keen on putting down smoking among the juniors--as an
2280,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"encroachment on their privilege, you see. They lick ’em twice as hard"
2281,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,for it as _we’d_ dare to.”
2282,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2283,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“Lick!” Mr. Brownell cried. “One expels! One expels! _I_ know the end
2284,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"of these practices.” He told his companion, in detail, with anecdotes"
2285,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"and inferences, a great deal more about the Animal Boy."
2286,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2287,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“Ah!” said the Reverend John to himself. “You’ll leave at the end
2288,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,of the term; but you’ll have a deuce of a time first.” Aloud:
2289,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“We-ell, I suppose no one can be sure of any school’s tendency at"
2290,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"any given moment, but, personally, I should incline to believe that"
2291,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,we’re reasonably free from the--er--monastic microbes of--er--older
2292,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,institutions.”
2293,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2294,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“But a school’s a school. You can’t get out of _that_! It’s
2295,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"preposterous! You must admit _that_,” Mr. Brownell insisted."
2296,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2297,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"They were within hail of Pot by now, and the Reverend John asked him"
2298,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,how Affairs of State stood.
2299,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2300,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“All right, thank you, sir. How are you, sir?”"
2301,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2302,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Loungin’ round and sufferin’, my son. What about the dates of the"
2303,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Exeter and Tiverton matches?”
2304,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2305,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“As late in the term as we can get ’em, don’t you think, sir?”"
2306,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2307,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Quite! Specially Blundell’s. They’re our dearest foe,” he explained to"
2308,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"the frozen Mr. Brownell. “Aren’t we rather light in the scrum just now,"
2309,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Mullins?”
2310,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2311,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“’Fraid so, sir: but Packman’s playin’ forward this term.”"
2312,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2313,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“_At_ last!” cried the Reverend John. (Packman was Pot’s
2314,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"second-in-command, who considered himself a heaven-born half-back, but"
2315,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Pot had been working on him diplomatically.) “He’ll be a pillar, at any"
2316,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"rate. Lend me one of your fuzees, please. I’ve only got matches.”"
2317,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2318,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Mr. Brownell was unused to this sort of talk. “A bad beginning to a bad
2319,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"business,” he muttered as they returned to College."
2320,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2321,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Pot finished out his meditations; from time to time rubbing up the
2322,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"gloss on his new seven-and-sixpenny silver-mounted, rather hot,"
2323,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"myall-wood pipe, with its very thin crust in the bowl."
2324,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2325,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,*       *       *       *       *
2326,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2327,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"As the Studies brought back brackets and pictures for their walls, so"
2328,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"did they bring odds and ends of speech--theatre, opera, and music-hall"
2329,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"gags--from the great holiday world; some of which stuck for a term,"
2330,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"and others were discarded. Number Five was unpacking, when Dick Four"
2331,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"(King’s House) of the red nose and dramatic instincts, who with Pussy"
2332,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"and Tertius[1] inhabited the study below, loafed up and asked them “how"
2333,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"their symptoms seemed to segashuate.” They said nothing at the time,"
2334,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,for they knew Dick had a giddy uncle who took him to the Pavilion and
2335,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"the Cri, and all would be explained later. But, before they met again,"
2336,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Beetle came across two fags at war in a box-room, one of whom cried"
2337,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"to the other: “Turn me loose, or I’ll knock the natal stuffin’ out of"
2338,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"you.” Beetle demanded why he, being offal, presumed to use this strange"
2339,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,speech. The fag said it came out of a new book about rabbits and foxes
2340,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"and turtles and niggers, which was in his locker. (_Uncle Remus_ was a"
2341,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,popular holiday gift-book in Shotover’s year: when Cetewayo lived in
2342,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"the Melbury Road, Arabi Pasha in Egypt, and Spofforth on the Oval.)"
2343,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Beetle had it out and read for some time, standing by the window,"
2344,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,ere he carried it off to Number Five and began at once to give a
2345,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,wonderful story of a Tar Baby. Stalky tore it from him because he
2346,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"sputtered incoherently; McTurk, for the same cause, wrenching it from"
2347,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Stalky. There was no prep that night. The book was amazing, and full of"
2348,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,quotations that one could hurl like javelins. When they came down to
2349,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"prayers, Stalky, to show he was abreast of the latest movement, pounded"
2350,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,on the door of Dick Four’s study shouting a couplet that pleased him:
2351,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2352,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“Ti-yi! Tungalee!
2353,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,I eat um pea! I pick um pea!”
2354,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2355,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Upon which Dick Four, hornpiping and squinting, and not at all unlike a"
2356,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"bull-frog, came out and answered from the bottom of his belly, whence"
2357,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,he could produce incredible noises:
2358,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2359,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Ingle-go-jang, my joy, my joy!"
2360,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Ingle-go-jang, my joy!"
2361,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"_I’m_ right at home, my joy, my joy!----”"
2362,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2363,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,The chants seemed to answer the ends of their being created for the
2364,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"moment. They all sang them the whole way up the corridor, and, after"
2365,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"prayers, bore the burdens dispersedly to their several dormitories"
2366,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"where they found many who knew the book of the words, but who, boylike,"
2367,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,had waited for a lead ere giving tongue. In a short time the College
2368,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,was as severely infected with _Uncle Remus_ as it had been with
2369,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,_Pinafore_ and _Patience_. King realised it specially because he was
2370,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"running Macrea’s House in addition to his own and, Dick Four said, was"
2371,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,telling his new charges what he thought of his “esteemed colleague’s”
2372,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,methods of House-control.
2373,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2374,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"The Reverend John was talking to the Head in the latter’s study,"
2375,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,perhaps a fortnight later.
2376,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2377,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“If you’d only wired _me_,” he said. “I could have dug up something"
2378,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,that might have tided us over. This man’s dangerous.”
2379,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2380,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“_Mea culpa!_” the Head replied. “I had so much on hand. Our Governing
2381,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Council alone----But what do _We_ make of him?”
2382,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2383,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“Trust Youth! _We_ call him ‘Mister.’”
2384,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2385,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“‘Mister Brownell’?”
2386,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2387,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“Just ‘Mister.’ It took _Us_ three days to plumb his soul.”
2388,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2389,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“And he doesn’t approve of Our institutions? You say he is On the
2390,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Track--eh? He suspects the worst?”
2391,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2392,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,The School Chaplain nodded.
2393,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2394,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“We-ell. _I_ should say that that was the one tendency we had _not_
2395,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"developed. Setting aside we haven’t even a curtain in a dormitory, let"
2396,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,alone a lock to any form-room door--there has to be tradition in these
2397,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,things.”
2398,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2399,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“So I believe. So, indeed, one knows. And--’tisn’t as if I ever"
2400,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,preached on personal purity either.”
2401,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2402,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"The Head laughed. “No, or you’d join Brownell at term-end. By the way,"
2403,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,what’s this new line of Patristic discourse you’re giving us in church?
2404,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,I found myself listening to some of it last Sunday.”
2405,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2406,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“Oh! My early Christianity sermons? I bought a dozen ready made in Town
2407,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,just before I came down. Some one who knows his Gibbon must have done
2408,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"’em. Aren’t they good?” The Reverend John, who was no hand at written"
2409,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"work, beamed self-approvingly. There was a knock and Pot entered."
2410,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2411,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"The weather had defeated him, at last. All footer-grounds, he reported,"
2412,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"were unplayable, and must be rested. His idea, to keep things going,"
2413,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"was Big and Little Side Paper-chases thrice a week. For the Juniors, a"
2414,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,shortish course on the Burrows which he intended to oversee personally
2415,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"the first few times, while Packman lunged Big Side across the inland"
2416,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"and upland ploughs, for proper sweats. There was some question of"
2417,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"bounds that he asked authority to vary; and, would the Head please"
2418,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"say which afternoons would interfere least with the Army Class, Extra"
2419,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Tuition.
2420,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2421,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"As to bounds, the Head left those, as usual, entirely to Pot. The"
2422,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Reverend John volunteered to shift one of his extra-Tu classes from
2423,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,four to five P. M. till after prayers--nine to ten. The whole question
2424,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,was settled in five minutes.
2425,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2426,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“_We_ hate paper-chases, don’t we, Pot?” the Headmaster asked as the"
2427,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Head of Games rose.
2428,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2429,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Yes, sir, but it keeps ’em in training. Good night, sir.”"
2430,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2431,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“To go back----” drawled the Head when the door was well shut. “No-o.
2432,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,I do _not_ think so!... Ye-es! He’ll leave at the end of the term....
2433,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,A-aah! How does it go? ‘Don’t ’spute wid de squinch owl. Jam de shovel
2434,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"in de fier.’ Have you come across that extraordinary book, by the way?”"
2435,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2436,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Oh, yes. _We_’ve got it badly too. It has some sort of elemental"
2437,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"appeal, I suppose.”"
2438,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2439,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Here Mr. King came in with a neat little scheme for the reorganisation
2440,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"of certain details in Macrea’s House, where he had detected"
2441,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,reprehensible laxities. The Head sighed. The Reverend John only heard
2442,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,the beginnings of it. Then he slid out softly. He remembered he had not
2443,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,written to Macrea for quite a long time.
2444,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2445,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,*       *       *       *       *
2446,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2447,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"The first Big Side Paper-chase, in blinding wet, was as vile as even"
2448,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,the groaning and bemired Beetle had prophesied. But Dick Four had
2449,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"managed to run his own line when it skirted Bideford, and turned up at"
2450,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,the Lavatories half an hour late cherishing a movable tumour beneath
2451,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,his sweater.
2452,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2453,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Ingle-go-jang!” he chanted, and slipped out a warm but coy"
2454,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,land-tortoise.
2455,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2456,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“My Sacred Hat!” cried Stalky. “Brer Terrapin! Where you catchee? What
2457,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,you makee-do _aveck_?”
2458,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2459,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,This was Stalky’s notion of how they talked in _Uncle Remus_; and he
2460,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,spake no other tongue for weeks.
2461,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2462,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“I don’t know yet; but I had to get him. ’Man with a barrow full of ’em
2463,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"in Bridge Street. ’Gave me my choice for a bob. Leave him alone, you"
2464,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,owl! He won’t swim where you’ve been washing your filthy self! ‘_I_’m
2465,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"right at home, my joy, my joy.’” Dick’s nose shone like Bardolph’s as"
2466,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,he bubbled in the bath.
2467,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2468,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Just before tea-time, he, “Pussy,” and Tertius broke in upon Number"
2469,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Five, processionally, singing:"
2470,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2471,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Ingle-go-jang, my joy, my joy!"
2472,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Ingle-go-jang, my joy!"
2473,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"I’m right at home, my joy, my joy!"
2474,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Ingle-go-jang, my joy.”"
2475,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2476,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Brer Terrapin, painted _or_ and _sable_--King’s House-colours--swung by"
2477,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,a neatly contrived belly-band from the end of a broken jumping-pole.
2478,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,They thought rather well of taking him in to tea. They called at one or
2479,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"two studies on the way, and were warmly welcomed; but when they reached"
2480,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"the still shut doors of the dining-hall (Richards, ex-Petty Officer, R."
2481,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"N., was always unpunctual--but they needn’t have called him “Stinking"
2482,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Jim”) the whole school shouted approval. After the meal, Brer Terrapin"
2483,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"was borne the round of the form-rooms from Number One to Number Twelve,"
2484,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,in an unbroken roar of homage.
2485,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2486,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“To-morrow,” Dick Four announced, “we’ll sacrifice to him. Fags in"
2487,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,blazin’ paper-baskets!” and with thundering “Ingle-go-jangs” the Idol
2488,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,retired to its shrine.
2489,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2490,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"It had been a satisfactory performance. Little Hartopp, surprised"
2491,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"labelling “rocks” in Number Twelve, which held the Natural History"
2492,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Museum, had laughed consumedly; and the Reverend John, just before"
2493,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"prep, complimented Dick that he had not a single dissenter to his"
2494,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,following. In this respect the affair was an advance on Byzantium and
2495,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Alexandria which, of course, were torn by rival sects led by militant"
2496,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Bishops or zealous heathen. _Vide_, (Beetle,) _Hypatia_, and (if Dick"
2497,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Four ever listened, instead of privily swotting up his Euclid, in"
2498,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Church) the Reverend John’s own sermons. Mr. King, who had heard the"
2499,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"noise but had not appeared, made no comment till dinner, when he told"
2500,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,the Common Room ceiling that he entertained the lowest opinion of Uncle
2501,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Remus’s buffoonery, but opined that it might interest certain types"
2502,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"of intellect. Little Hartopp, School Librarian, who had, by special"
2503,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"request, laid in an extra copy of the book, differed acridly. He"
2504,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"had, he said, heard or overheard every salient line of _Uncle Remus_"
2505,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"quoted, appositely too, by boys whom he would not have credited with"
2506,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,intellectual interests. Mr. King repeated that he was wearied by the
2507,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,senseless and childish repetitions of immature minds. He recalled the
2508,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,_Patience_ epidemic. Mr. Prout did not care for _Uncle Remus_--the
2509,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,dialect put him off--but he thought the Houses were getting a bit
2510,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"out of hand. There was nothing one could lay hold of, of course--“As"
2511,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"yet,” Mr. Brownell interjected darkly. “But this larking about in"
2512,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"form-rooms,” he added, “had potentialities which, if _he_ knew anything"
2513,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"of the Animal Boy, would develop--or had developed.”"
2514,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2515,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“I shouldn’t wonder,” said the Reverend John. “This is the first time"
2516,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,to my knowledge that Stalky has ever played second-fiddle to any one.
2517,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Brer Terrapin was entirely Dick Four’s notion. By the way, he was"
2518,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"painted _your_ House-colours, King.”"
2519,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2520,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“Was he?” said King artlessly. “I have always held that our Dickson
2521,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Quartus had the rudiments of imagination. We will look into it--look
2522,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,into it.”
2523,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2524,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“In our loathsome calling, more things are done by judicious letting"
2525,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"alone than by any other,” the Reverend John grunted."
2526,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2527,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“I can’t subscribe to that,” said Mr. Prout. “_You_ haven’t a House,”"
2528,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,and for once Mr. King backed Prout.
2529,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2530,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“Thank Heaven I haven’t. Or I should be like you two. Leave ’em alone!
2531,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Leave ’em alone! Haven’t you ever seen puppies fighting over a slipper
2532,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,for hours?”
2533,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2534,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Yes, but Gillette admits that Dickson Quartus was the only begetter"
2535,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,of this manifestation. I wasn’t aware that the--er--Testacean had been
2536,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"tricked out in _my_ colours,” said King."
2537,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2538,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"And at that very hour, Number Five Study--“prep” thrown to the"
2539,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,winds--were toiling inspiredly at a Tar Baby made up of Beetle’s
2540,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"sweater, and half-a-dozen lavatory-towels; a condemned cretonne curtain"
2541,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"and ditto baize table-cloth for “natal stuffin’”; an ancient, but"
2542,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,air-tight puntabout-ball for the head; all three play-box ropes for
2543,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,bindings; and most of Richard’s weekly blacking allowance for Prout’s
2544,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,House’s boots to give tone to the whole.
2545,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2546,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“Gummy!” said Beetle when their curtain-pole had been taken down and
2547,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Tar Baby hitched to the end of it by a loop in its voluptuous back. “It
2548,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"looks pretty average indecent, somehow.”"
2549,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2550,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“You can use it this way, too,” Turkey demonstrated, handling the"
2551,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"curtain-pole like a flail. “Now, shove it in the fireplace to dry an’"
2552,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,we’ll wash up.”
2553,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2554,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“But--but,” said Stalky, fascinated by the unspeakable front and behind"
2555,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,of the black and bulging horror. “How _come_ he lookee so hellish?”
2556,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2557,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Dead easy! If you do anything with your whole heart, Ruskin says, you"
2558,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,always pull off something dam’-fine. Brer Terrapin’s only a natural
2559,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"animal; but Tar Baby’s Art,” McTurk explained."
2560,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2561,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“I see! ‘If you’re anxious for to shine in the high æsthetic line.’
2562,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Well, Tar Baby’s the filthiest thing _I_’ve ever seen in my life,”"
2563,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Stalky concluded. “King’ll be rabid.”
2564,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2565,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"The United idolaters set forth, side by side, at five o’clock next"
2566,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"afternoon; Brer Terrapin, wide awake, and swimming hard into nothing;"
2567,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Tar Baby lurching from side to side with a lascivious abandon that made
2568,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Foxy, the School Sergeant, taking defaulters’ drill in the Corridor,"
2569,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,squawk like an outraged hen. And when they ceremoniously saluted
2570,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"each other, like aristocratic heads on revolutionary pikes, it beat"
2571,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"the previous day’s performance out of sight and mind. The very fags,"
2572,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"offered up, till the bottoms of the paper-baskets carried away, as"
2573,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"heave-offerings before them, fell over each other for the honour; and"
2574,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"House by House, when the news spread, dropped its doings, and followed"
2575,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,the Mysteries--not without song.
2576,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2577,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Some say it was a fag of Prout’s who appealed for rescue from Brer
2578,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Terrapin to Tar Baby; others, that the introits to the respective"
2579,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,creeds (“Ingle-go-jang”--“Ti-yi-Tungalee!”) carried in themselves the
2580,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"seeds of dissent. At any rate, the cleavage developed as swiftly as"
2581,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"in a new religion, and by tea-time when they were fairly hoarse, the"
2582,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"rolling world was rent to the death between Ingles _versus_ Tungles,"
2583,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,and Brer Terrapin had swept out Number Eleven form-room to the
2584,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,War-cry: “Here I come a-bulgin’ and a-bilin’.” Prep stopped further
2585,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"developments, but they agreed that, as a recreation for wet autumn"
2586,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"evenings, the jape was unequalled, and called for its repetition on"
2587,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Saturday.
2588,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2589,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"That was a brilliant evening, too. Both sides went into prayers"
2590,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,practically re-dressing themselves. There was a smell of singed fag
2591,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,down the lines and a watery eye or so; but nothing to which the most
2592,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,fastidious could have objected. The Reverend John hinted something
2593,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,about roof-lifting noises.
2594,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2595,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Oh, _no_, Padre, Sahib. We were only billin’ an’ cooin’ a bit,” Stalky"
2596,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,explained. “We haven’t really begun. There’s goin’ to be a tug-o’-war
2597,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,next Saturday with Miss Meadow’s bed-cord----”
2598,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2599,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“‘Which in dem days would ha’ hilt a mule,’” the Reverend John quoted."
2600,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Well, I’ve got to be impartial. I wish you both good luck.”"
2601,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2602,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"The week, with its three paper-chases, passed uneventfully, but for a"
2603,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,certain amount of raiding and reprisals on new lines that might have
2604,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,warned them they were playing with fire. The Juniors had learned to
2605,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,use the sacred war-chants as signals of distress; oppressed Ingles
2606,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"squealing for aid against oppressing Tungles, and _vice versa_; so"
2607,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,that one never knew when a peaceful form-room would flare up in
2608,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"song and slaughter. But not a soul dreamed, for a moment, that that"
2609,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Saturday’s jape would develop into--what it did! They were rigidly
2610,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,punctilious about the ritual; exquisitely careful as to the weights
2611,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"on Miss Meadow’s bed-cord, kindly lent by Richards, who said he knew"
2612,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"nothing about mules, but guaranteed it would hold a barge’s crew; and"
2613,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"if Dick Four chose to caparison himself as Archimandrite of Joppa,"
2614,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"black as burned cork could make him, why, Stalky, in a nightgown kilted"
2615,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"up beneath his sweater, was equally the Pope Symmachus, just converted"
2616,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,from heathendom but given to alarming relapses.
2617,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2618,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,It began after tea--say 6.50 P. M. It got into its stride by 7.30 when
2619,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Turkey, with pillows bound round the ends of forms, invented the Royal"
2620,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Battering-Ram Corps. It grew and--it grew till a quarter to nine when
2621,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"the Prefects, most of whom had fought on one side or the other, thought"
2622,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,it time to stop and went in with ground-ashes and the bare hand for ten
2623,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,minutes....
2624,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2625,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Honours for the action were not awarded by the Head till Monday morning
2626,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"when he dealt out one dozen lickings to selected seniors, eight"
2627,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“millies” (one thousand), fourteen “usuals” (five hundred lines), minor"
2628,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"impositions past count, and a stoppage of pocket-money on a scale and"
2629,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,for a length of time unprecedented in modern history.
2630,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2631,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,He said the College was within an ace of being burned to the ground
2632,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,when the gas-jet in Number Eleven form-room--where they tried to burn
2633,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Tar Baby, fallen for the moment into the hands of the enemy--was"
2634,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"wrenched off, and the lit gas spouted all over the ceiling till some"
2635,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,one plugged the pipe with dormitory soap. He said that nothing save
2636,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,his consideration for their future careers kept him from expelling
2637,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,the wanton ruffians who had noosed all the desks in Number Twelve
2638,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"and swept them up in one crackling mound, barring a couple that had"
2639,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"pitch-poled through the window. This, again, had been no man’s design"
2640,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"but the inspiration of necessity when Tar Baby’s bodyguard, surrounded"
2641,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"but defiant, was only rescued at the last minute by Turkey’s immortal"
2642,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,flank-attack with the battering-rams that carried away the door of
2643,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Number Nine. He said that the same remarks applied to the fireplace and
2644,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,mantelpiece in Number Seven which everybody had seen fall out of the
2645,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,wall of their own motion after Brer Terrapin had hitched Miss Meadow’s
2646,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,bed-cord to the bars of the grate.
2647,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2648,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"He said much more, too; but as King pointed out in Common Room that"
2649,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"evening, his canings were inept, he had _not_ confiscated the Idols"
2650,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"and, above all, had not castigated, as King would have castigated, the"
2651,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,disgusting childishness of all concerned.
2652,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2653,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Well,” said Little Hartopp. “I saw the Prefects choking them off as"
2654,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,we came into prayers. You’ve reason to reckon that in the scale of
2655,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,suffering.”
2656,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2657,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“And more than half the damage was done under _your_ banner, King,” the"
2658,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Reverend John added.
2659,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2660,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“That doesn’t affect my judgment; though, as a matter of fact, I"
2661,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,believe Brer Terrapin triumphed over Tar Baby all along the line.
2662,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Didn’t he, Prout?”"
2663,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2664,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“It didn’t seem to me a fitting time to ask. The Tar Babies were
2665,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"handicapped, of course, by not being able to--ah--tackle a live animal.”"
2666,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2667,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“I confess,” Mr. Brownell volunteered, “it was the studious perversity"
2668,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"of certain aspects of the orgy which impressed _me_. And yet, what can"
2669,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,one exp----”
2670,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2671,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“How do you mean?” King demanded. “Dickson Quartus may be eccentric,"
2672,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,but----”
2673,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2674,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“I was alluding to the vile and calculated indecency of that black
2675,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,doll.”
2676,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2677,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Mr. Brownell had passed Tar Baby going down to battle, all round and"
2678,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"ripe, before Turkey had begun to use it as Bishop Odo’s holy-water"
2679,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,sprinkler.
2680,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2681,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,“It is possible you didn’t----”
2682,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2683,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“_I_ never noticed anything,” said Prout. “If there had been, I should"
2684,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,have been the first----”
2685,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2686,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Here Little Hartopp sniggered, which did not cool the air."
2687,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2688,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Peradventure,” King began with due intake of the breath. “Peradventure"
2689,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,even _I_ might have taken cognizance of the matter both for my own
2690,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,House’s sake and for my colleague’s.... No! Folly I concede. Utter
2691,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"childishness and complete absence of discipline in _all_ quarters, as"
2692,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"the natural corollary to dabbling in so-called transatlantic humour, I"
2693,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,frankly admit. But that there was anything esoterically obscene in the
2694,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,outbreak I absolutely deny.”
2695,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2696,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“They’ve been fighting for weeks over those things,” said Mr. Prout."
2697,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“’Silly, of course, but I don’t see how it can be dangerous.”"
2698,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2699,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Quite true. Any House-master of experience knows _that_, Brownell,”"
2700,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,the Reverend John put in reprovingly.
2701,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2702,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Given a normal basis of tradition and conduct--certainly,” Mr."
2703,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Brownell answered. “But with such amazing traditions as exist here,"
2704,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,no man with any experience of the Animal Boy can draw your deceptive
2705,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,inferences. That’s all _I_ mean.”
2706,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2707,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Once again, and not for the first time, but with greater heat he"
2708,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"testified what smoking led to--what, indeed, he was morally certain"
2709,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,existed in full blast under their noses....
2710,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2711,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"Gloves were off in three minutes. Pessimists, no more than poets,"
2712,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"love each other, and even when they work together it is one thing"
2713,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,to pessimise congenially with an ancient and tried associate who is
2714,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"also a butt, and another to be pessimised over by an inexperienced"
2715,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"junior, even though the latter’s college career may have included more"
2716,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"exhibitions--nay, even pot-huntings--than one’s own. The Reverend John"
2717,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"did his best to pour water on the flames. Little Hartopp, perceiving"
2718,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"that it was pure oil, threw in canfuls of his own, from the wings."
2719,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"In the end, words passed which would have made the Common Room"
2720,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"uninhabitable for the future, but that Macrea had written (the Reverend"
2721,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,John had seen the letter) saying that his knee was fairly re-knit and
2722,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,he was prepared to take on again at half-term. This happened to be the
2723,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,only date since the Creation beyond which Mr. Brownell’s self-respect
2724,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"would not permit him to stay one hour. It solved the situation, amid"
2725,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"puffings and blowings and bitter epigrams, and a most distinguished"
2726,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,stateliness of bearing all round till Mr. Brownell’s departure.
2727,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2728,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,*       *       *       *       *
2729,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2730,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“My dear fellow!” said the Reverend John to Macrea, on the first night"
2731,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,of the latter’s return. “I _do_ hope there was nothing in my letters
2732,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,to you--you asked me to keep you posted--that gave you any idea King
2733,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,wasn’t doing his best with your House according to his lights?”

2742,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"“Well, well. You mustn’t judge us too harshly. I dare say there’s a"
2743,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"great deal in what you say. Oh, yes! King’s conduct was inexcusable,"
2744,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"absolutely inexcusable! About the smoking? Lamentable, but we must all"
2745,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"bow down, more or less, in the House of Rimmon. _We_ have to compete"

2747,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,
2748,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,"To the Head, in the silence of his study, next day: “He didn’t seem"

2750,THE UNITED IDOLATERS,Luckily he lost his temper (King and he are own brothers) and he

2884,THE WISH HOUSE,
2885,THE WISH HOUSE,"Much was to be said, and many ends, loose since last time, to be"

2901,THE WISH HOUSE,Mrs. Ashcroft shook her head slowly--she never hurried--and went on

2905,THE WISH HOUSE,
2906,THE WISH HOUSE,“What like’s this new Visitor o’ yourn?” Mrs. Fettley inquired with

3021,THE WISH HOUSE,
3022,THE WISH HOUSE,"Mrs. Fettley drew up to buttered toast, currant bread, stewed tea,"
3023,THE WISH HOUSE,"bitter as leather, some home-preserved pears, and a cold boiled pig’s"

3025,THE WISH HOUSE,
3026,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Yes. I dunno as I’ve ever owed me belly much,” said Mrs. Ashcroft"
3027,THE WISH HOUSE,thoughtfully. “We only go through this world once.”
3028,THE WISH HOUSE,
3029,THE WISH HOUSE,"“But don’t it lay heavy on ye, sometimes?” her guest suggested."
3030,THE WISH HOUSE,
3031,THE WISH HOUSE,“Nurse says I’m a sight liker to die o’ me indigestion than me leg.”
3032,THE WISH HOUSE,"For Mrs. Ashcroft had a long-standing ulcer on her shin, which needed"
3033,THE WISH HOUSE,"regular care from the Village Nurse, who boasted (or others did, for"
3034,THE WISH HOUSE,her) that she had dressed it one hundred and three times already during
3035,THE WISH HOUSE,her term of office.
3036,THE WISH HOUSE,
3037,THE WISH HOUSE,"“An’ you that _was_ so able, too! It’s all come on ye before your full"

3051,THE WISH HOUSE,
3052,THE WISH HOUSE,"Mrs. Fettley stared, with jaw half-dropped, at the grocer’s bright"

3061,THE WISH HOUSE,"read ’is death-notice to me, out o’ the paper last month. O’ course"
3062,THE WISH HOUSE,it wadn’t any o’ _my_ becomin’ concerns--let be I ’adn’t set eyes on

3082,THE WISH HOUSE,
3083,THE WISH HOUSE,“Well I never! But what did your ’usband say to that?” Mrs. Fettley
3084,THE WISH HOUSE,"asked, when the deep-toned recital halted."

3086,THE WISH HOUSE,“’E said I might go where I pleased for all of ’im. But seein’ ’e
3087,THE WISH HOUSE,"was bedrid, I said I’d ’tend ’im out. ’E knowed I wouldn’t take no"
3088,THE WISH HOUSE,advantage of ’im in that state. ’E lasted eight or nine week. Then he
3089,THE WISH HOUSE,was took with a seizure-like; an’ laid stone-still for days. Then ’e
3090,THE WISH HOUSE,propped ’imself up abed an’ says: ‘You pray no man’ll ever deal with
3091,THE WISH HOUSE,"you like you’ve dealed with some.’ ‘An’ you?’ I says, for _you_ know,"
3092,THE WISH HOUSE,"Liz, what a rover ’e was. ‘It cuts both ways,’ says ’e, ‘but _I_’m"
3093,THE WISH HOUSE,"death-wise, an’ I can see what’s comin’ to you.” He died a-Sunday"
3094,THE WISH HOUSE,an’ was buried a-Thursday.... An’ yet I’d set a heap by him--one time
3095,THE WISH HOUSE,or--did I ever?”
3096,THE WISH HOUSE,
3097,THE WISH HOUSE,"“You never told me that before,” Mrs. Fettley ventured."
3098,THE WISH HOUSE,
3099,THE WISH HOUSE,"“I’m payin’ ye for what ye told me just now. Him bein’ dead, I wrote"
3100,THE WISH HOUSE,"up, sayin’ I was free for good, to that Mrs. Marshall in Lunnon--which"
3101,THE WISH HOUSE,"gave me my first place as kitchen-maid--Lord, how long ago! She was"
3102,THE WISH HOUSE,"well pleased, for they two was both gettin’ on, an’ I knowed their"
3103,THE WISH HOUSE,"ways. You remember, Liz, I used to go to ’em in service between whiles,"
3104,THE WISH HOUSE,"for years--when we wanted money, or--or my ’usband was away--on"
3105,THE WISH HOUSE,occasion.”
3106,THE WISH HOUSE,
3107,THE WISH HOUSE,"“’E _did_ get that six months at Chichester, didn’t ’e?” Mrs. Fettley"
3108,THE WISH HOUSE,whispered. “We never rightly won to the bottom of it.”
3109,THE WISH HOUSE,
3110,THE WISH HOUSE,"“’E’d ha’ got more, but the man didn’t die.”"
3111,THE WISH HOUSE,
3112,THE WISH HOUSE,"“’None o’ your doin’s, was it, Gra’?”"
3113,THE WISH HOUSE,
3114,THE WISH HOUSE,"“No! ’Twas the woman’s husband this time. An’ so, my man bein’ dead,"
3115,THE WISH HOUSE,"I went back to them Marshall’s, as cook, to get me legs under a"
3116,THE WISH HOUSE,"gentleman’s table again, and be called with a handle to me name. That"
3117,THE WISH HOUSE,was the year you shifted to Portsmouth.”
3118,THE WISH HOUSE,
3119,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Cosham,” Mrs. Fettley corrected. “There was a middlin’ lot o’ new"
3120,THE WISH HOUSE,"buildin’ bein’ done there. My man went first, an’ got the room, an’ I"
3121,THE WISH HOUSE,follered.”
3122,THE WISH HOUSE,
3123,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Well, then, I was a year-abouts in Lunnon, all at a breath, like,"
3124,THE WISH HOUSE,"four meals a day an’ livin’ easy. Then, ’long towards autumn, they two"
3125,THE WISH HOUSE,"went travellin’, like, to France; keepin’ me on, for they couldn’t do"
3126,THE WISH HOUSE,"without me. I put the house to rights for the caretaker, an’ then I"
3127,THE WISH HOUSE,"slipped down ’ere to me sister Bessie--me wages in me pockets, an’ all"
3128,THE WISH HOUSE,’ands glad to be’old of me.”
3129,THE WISH HOUSE,
3130,THE WISH HOUSE,"“That would be when I was at Cosham,” said Mrs. Fettley."
3131,THE WISH HOUSE,
3132,THE WISH HOUSE,"“_You_ know, Liz, there wasn’t no cheap-dog pride to folk, those days,"
3133,THE WISH HOUSE,no more than there was cinemas nor whisk-drives. Man or woman ’ud lay
3134,THE WISH HOUSE,"hold o’ any job that promised a shillin’ to the backside of it, didn’t"
3135,THE WISH HOUSE,"they? I was all peaked up after Lunnon, an’ I thought the fresh airs"
3136,THE WISH HOUSE,"’ud serve me. So I took on at Smalldene, obligin’ with a hand at the"
3137,THE WISH HOUSE,"early potato-liftin’, stubbin’ hens, an’ such-like. They’d ha’ mocked"
3138,THE WISH HOUSE,"me sore in my kitchen in Lunnon, to see me in men’s boots, an’ me"
3139,THE WISH HOUSE,petticoats all shorted.”
3140,THE WISH HOUSE,
3141,THE WISH HOUSE,“Did it bring ye any good?” Mrs. Fettley asked.
3142,THE WISH HOUSE,
3143,THE WISH HOUSE,"“’Twadn’t for that I went. You know, ’s’well’s me, that na’un happens"
3144,THE WISH HOUSE,to ye till it _’as_ ’appened. Your mind don’t warn ye before’and of
3145,THE WISH HOUSE,"the road ye’ve took, till you’re at the far eend of it. We’ve only a"
3146,THE WISH HOUSE,backwent view of our proceedin’s.”
3147,THE WISH HOUSE,
3148,THE WISH HOUSE,“’Oo was it?”
3149,THE WISH HOUSE,
3150,THE WISH HOUSE,“’Arry Mockler.” Mrs. Ashcroft’s face puckered to the pain of her sick
3151,THE WISH HOUSE,leg.
3152,THE WISH HOUSE,
3153,THE WISH HOUSE,Mrs. Fettley gasped. “’Arry? Bert Mockler’s son! An’ _I_ never guessed!”
3154,THE WISH HOUSE,
3155,THE WISH HOUSE,Mrs. Ashcroft nodded. “An’ I told myself--_an’_ I beleft it--that I
3156,THE WISH HOUSE,wanted field-work.”
3157,THE WISH HOUSE,
3158,THE WISH HOUSE,“What did ye get out of it?”
3159,THE WISH HOUSE,
3160,THE WISH HOUSE,“The usuals. Everythin’ at first--worse than naught after. I had signs
3161,THE WISH HOUSE,"an’ warnings a-plenty, but I took no heed of ’em. For we was burnin’"
3162,THE WISH HOUSE,"rubbish one day, just when we’d come to know how ’twas with--with both"
3163,THE WISH HOUSE,"of us. ’Twas early in the year for burnin’, an’ I said so. ‘No!’ says"
3164,THE WISH HOUSE,"he. ‘The sooner dat old stuff’s off an’ done with,’ ’e says, ‘the"
3165,THE WISH HOUSE,better.’ ’Is face was harder’n rocks when he spoke. Then it come over
3166,THE WISH HOUSE,"me that I’d found me master, which I ’adn’t ever before. I’d allus"
3167,THE WISH HOUSE,"owned ’em, like.”"
3168,THE WISH HOUSE,
3169,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Yes! Yes! They’re yourn or you’re theirn,” the other sighed. “I like"
3170,THE WISH HOUSE,the right way best.”
3171,THE WISH HOUSE,
3172,THE WISH HOUSE,"“I didn’t. But ’Arry did.... ’Long then, it come time for me to go back"
3173,THE WISH HOUSE,"to Lunnon. I couldn’t. I clean couldn’t! So, I took an’ tipped a dollop"
3174,THE WISH HOUSE,o’ scaldin’ water out o’ the copper one Monday mornin’ over me left
3175,THE WISH HOUSE,’and and arm. Dat stayed me where I was for another fortnight.”
3176,THE WISH HOUSE,
3177,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Was it worth it?” said Mrs. Fettley, looking at the silvery scar on"
3178,THE WISH HOUSE,the wrinkled fore-arm.
3179,THE WISH HOUSE,
3180,THE WISH HOUSE,"Mrs. Ashcroft nodded. “An’ after that, we two made it up ’twixt us so’s"
3181,THE WISH HOUSE,’e could come to Lunnon for a job in a liv’ry-stable not far from me.
3182,THE WISH HOUSE,’E got it. _I_ ’tended to that. There wadn’t no talk nowhere. His own
3183,THE WISH HOUSE,"mother never suspicioned how ’twas. He just slipped up to Lunnon, an’"
3184,THE WISH HOUSE,"there we abode that winter, not ’alf a mile t’other from each.”"
3185,THE WISH HOUSE,
3186,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Ye paid ’is fare an’ all, though”; Mrs. Fettley spoke convincedly."
3187,THE WISH HOUSE,
3188,THE WISH HOUSE,Again Mrs. Ashcroft nodded. “Dere wadn’t much I didn’t do for him.
3189,THE WISH HOUSE,"’E was me master, an’--O God, help us!--we’d laugh over it walkin’"
3190,THE WISH HOUSE,"together after dark in them paved streets, an’ me corns fair wrenchin’"
3191,THE WISH HOUSE,in me boots! I’d never been like that before. Ner he! Ner he!”
3192,THE WISH HOUSE,
3193,THE WISH HOUSE,Mrs. Fettley clucked sympathetically.
3194,THE WISH HOUSE,
3195,THE WISH HOUSE,“An’ when did ye come to the eend?” she asked.
3196,THE WISH HOUSE,
3197,THE WISH HOUSE,"“When ’e paid it all back again, every penny. Then I knowed, but I"
3198,THE WISH HOUSE,"wouldn’t _suffer_ meself to know. ‘You’ve been mortal kind to me,’ he"
3199,THE WISH HOUSE,says. ‘Kind!’ I said. ‘’Twixt _us_?’ But ’e kep’ all on tellin’ me ’ow
3200,THE WISH HOUSE,kind I’d been an’ ’e’d never forget it all his days. I held it from
3201,THE WISH HOUSE,"off o’ me for three evenin’s, because I would _not_ believe. Then ’e"
3202,THE WISH HOUSE,"talked about not bein’ satisfied with ’is job in the stables, an’ the"
3203,THE WISH HOUSE,"men there puttin’ tricks on ’im, an’ all they lies which a man tells"
3204,THE WISH HOUSE,"when ’e’s leavin’ ye. I heard ’im out, neither ’elpin’ nor ’inderin’."
3205,THE WISH HOUSE,"At the last, I took off a liddle brooch which he’d give me an’ I says:"
3206,THE WISH HOUSE,‘Dat’ll do. _I_ ain’t askin’ na’un.’ An’ I turned me round an’ walked
3207,THE WISH HOUSE,off to me own sufferin’s. ’E didn’t make ’em worse. ’E didn’t come nor
3208,THE WISH HOUSE,write after that. ’E slipped off ’ere back ’ome to ’is mother again.”
3209,THE WISH HOUSE,
3210,THE WISH HOUSE,“An’ ’ow often did ye look for ’en to come back?” Mrs. Fettley demanded
3211,THE WISH HOUSE,mercilessly.
3212,THE WISH HOUSE,
3213,THE WISH HOUSE,"“More’n once--more’n once! Goin’ over the streets we’d used, I thought"
3214,THE WISH HOUSE,de very pave-stones ’ud shruck out under me feet.”
3215,THE WISH HOUSE,
3216,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Yes,” said Mrs. Fettley. “I dunno but dat don’t ’urt as much as aught"
3217,THE WISH HOUSE,else. An’ dat was all ye got?”
3218,THE WISH HOUSE,
3219,THE WISH HOUSE,"“No. ’Twadn’t. That’s the curious part, if you’ll believe it, Liz.”"
3220,THE WISH HOUSE,
3221,THE WISH HOUSE,"“I do. I lay you’re further off lyin’ now than in all your life, Gra’.”"
3222,THE WISH HOUSE,
3223,THE WISH HOUSE,"“I am.... An’ I suffered, like I’d not wish my most arrantest enemies"
3224,THE WISH HOUSE,to. God’s Own Name! I went through the hoop that spring! One part of it
3225,THE WISH HOUSE,was headaches which I’d never known all me days before. Think o’ _me_
3226,THE WISH HOUSE,with an ’eddick! But I come to be grateful for ’em. They kep’ me from
3227,THE WISH HOUSE,thinkin’....”
3228,THE WISH HOUSE,
3229,THE WISH HOUSE,"“’Tis like a tooth,” Mrs. Fettley commented. “It must rage an’ rugg"
3230,THE WISH HOUSE,till it tortures itself quiet on ye; an’ then--then there’s na’un left.”
3231,THE WISH HOUSE,
3232,THE WISH HOUSE,“_I_ got enough lef’ to last me all _my_ days on earth. It come about
3233,THE WISH HOUSE,through our charwoman’s liddle girl--Sophy Ellis was ’er name--all
3234,THE WISH HOUSE,"eyes an’ elbers an’ hunger. I used to give ’er vittles. Otherwhiles,"
3235,THE WISH HOUSE,"I took no special notice of ’er, an’ a sight less, o’ course, when me"
3236,THE WISH HOUSE,trouble about ’Arry was on me. But--you know how liddle maids first
3237,THE WISH HOUSE,"feel it sometimes--she come to be crazy-fond o’ me, pawin’ an’ cuddlin’"
3238,THE WISH HOUSE,"all whiles; an’ I ’adn’t the ’eart to beat ’er off.... One afternoon,"
3239,THE WISH HOUSE,"early in spring ’twas, ’er mother ’ad sent ’er round to scutchel up"
3240,THE WISH HOUSE,"what vittles she could off of us. I was settin’ by the fire, me apern"
3241,THE WISH HOUSE,"over me head, half-mad with the ’eddick, when she slips in. I reckon"
3242,THE WISH HOUSE,I was middlin’ short with ’er. ‘Lor’!’ she says. ‘Is _that_ all? I’ll
3243,THE WISH HOUSE,"take it off you in two-twos!’ I told her not to lay a finger on me, for"
3244,THE WISH HOUSE,I thought she’d want to stroke my forehead; an’--I ain’t that make.
3245,THE WISH HOUSE,"‘_I_ won’t tech ye,’ she says, an’ slips out again. She ’adn’t been"
3246,THE WISH HOUSE,gone ten minutes ’fore me old ’eddick took off quick as bein’ kicked.
3247,THE WISH HOUSE,"So I went about my work. Prasin’ly, Sophy comes back, an’ creeps into"
3248,THE WISH HOUSE,my chair quiet as a mouse. ’Er eyes was deep in ’er ’ead an’ ’er face
3249,THE WISH HOUSE,"all drawed. I asked ’er what ’ad ’appened. ‘Nothin’,’ she says. ‘On’y"
3250,THE WISH HOUSE,"_I_’ve got it now.’ ‘Got what?’ I says. ‘Your ’eddick,’ she says, all"
3251,THE WISH HOUSE,"hoarse an’ sticky-lipped. ‘I’ve took it on me.’ ‘Nonsense,’ I says, ‘it"
3252,THE WISH HOUSE,went of itself when you was out. Lay still an’ I’ll make ye a cup o’
3253,THE WISH HOUSE,"tea.’ ‘’Twon’t do no good,’ she says, ‘’til your time’s up. ’Ow long do"
3254,THE WISH HOUSE,"_your_ ’eddicks last?’ ‘Don’t talk silly,’ I says, ‘or I’ll send for"
3255,THE WISH HOUSE,the Doctor.’ It looked to me like she might be hatchin’ de measles.
3256,THE WISH HOUSE,"‘Oh, Mrs. Ashcroft,’ she says, stretchin’ out ’er liddle thin arms. ‘I"
3257,THE WISH HOUSE,_do_ love ye.’ There wasn’t any holdin’ agin that. I took ’er into me
3258,THE WISH HOUSE,"lap an’ made much of ’er. ‘Is it truly gone?’ she says. ‘Yes,’ I says,"
3259,THE WISH HOUSE,"‘an’ if ’twas you took it away, I’m truly grateful.’ ‘_’Twas_ me,’ she"
3260,THE WISH HOUSE,"says, layin’ ’er cheek to mine. ‘No one but me knows how.’ An’ then"
3261,THE WISH HOUSE,she said she’d changed me ’eddick for me at a Wish ’Ouse.”
3262,THE WISH HOUSE,
3263,THE WISH HOUSE,“Whatt?” Mrs. Fettley spoke sharply.
3264,THE WISH HOUSE,
3265,THE WISH HOUSE,"“A Wish ’Ouse. No! _I_ ’adn’t ’eard o’ such things, either. I couldn’t"
3266,THE WISH HOUSE,"get it straight at first, but, puttin’ all together, I made out that"
3267,THE WISH HOUSE,a Wish ’Ouse ’ad to be a house which ’ad stood unlet an’ empty long
3268,THE WISH HOUSE,"enough for Some One, like, to come an’ in’abit there. She said, a"
3269,THE WISH HOUSE,liddle girl that she’d played with in the livery-stables where ’Arry
3270,THE WISH HOUSE,worked ’ad told ’er so. She said the girl ’ad belonged in a caravan
3271,THE WISH HOUSE,"that laid up, o’ winters, in Lunnon. Gipsy, I judge.”"
3272,THE WISH HOUSE,
3273,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Ooh! There’s no sayin’ what Gippos know, but _I_’ve never ’eard of a"
3274,THE WISH HOUSE,"Wish ’Ouse, an’ I know--some things,” said Mrs. Fettley."
3275,THE WISH HOUSE,
3276,THE WISH HOUSE,“Sophy said there was a Wish ’Ouse in Wadloes Road--just a few streets
3277,THE WISH HOUSE,"off, on the way to our green-grocer’s. All you ’ad to do, she said, was"
3278,THE WISH HOUSE,to ring the bell an’ wish your wish through the slit o’ the letter-box.
3279,THE WISH HOUSE,"I asked ’er if the fairies give it ’er? ‘Don’t ye know,’ she says,"
3280,THE WISH HOUSE,‘there’s no fairies in a Wish ’Ouse? There’s only a Token.’”
3281,THE WISH HOUSE,
3282,THE WISH HOUSE,“Goo’ Lord A’mighty! Where did she come by _that_ word?” cried Mrs.
3283,THE WISH HOUSE,"Fettley; for a Token is a wraith of the dead or, worse still, of the"
3284,THE WISH HOUSE,living.
3285,THE WISH HOUSE,
3286,THE WISH HOUSE,"“The caravan-girl ’ad told ’er, she said. Well, Liz, it troubled me"
3287,THE WISH HOUSE,"to ’ear ’er, an’ lyin’ in me arms she must ha’ felt it. ‘That’s very"
3288,THE WISH HOUSE,"kind o’ you,’ I says, holdin’ ’er tight, ‘to wish me ’eddick away. But"
3289,THE WISH HOUSE,"why didn’t ye ask somethin’ nice for yourself?’ ‘You can’t do that,’"
3290,THE WISH HOUSE,she says. ‘All you’ll get at a Wish ’Ouse is leave to take some one
3291,THE WISH HOUSE,"else’s trouble. I’ve took Ma’s ’eadaches, when she’s been kind to me;"
3292,THE WISH HOUSE,"but this is the first time I’ve been able to do aught for you. Oh,"
3293,THE WISH HOUSE,"Mrs. Ashcroft, I _do_ just-about love you.’ An’ she goes on all like"
3294,THE WISH HOUSE,"that. Liz, I tell you my ’air e’en a’most stood on end to ’ear ’er. I"
3295,THE WISH HOUSE,"asked ’er what like a Token was. ‘I dunno,’ she says, ‘but after you’ve"
3296,THE WISH HOUSE,"ringed the bell, you’ll ’ear it run up from the basement, to the front"
3297,THE WISH HOUSE,"door. Then say your wish,’ she says, ‘an’ go away.’ ‘The Token don’t"
3298,THE WISH HOUSE,"open de door to ye, then?’ I says. ‘Oh, no,’ she says. ‘You on’y ’ear"
3299,THE WISH HOUSE,"gigglin’, like, be’ind the front door. Then you say you’ll take the"
3300,THE WISH HOUSE,trouble off of ’oo ever ’tis you’ve chose for your love; an’ ye’ll get
3301,THE WISH HOUSE,"it,’ she says. I didn’t ask no more--she was too ’ot an’ fevered. I"
3302,THE WISH HOUSE,"made much of ’er till it come time to light de gas, an’ a liddle after"
3303,THE WISH HOUSE,"that, ’er ’eddick--mine, I suppose--took off, an’ she got down an’"
3304,THE WISH HOUSE,played with the cat.”
3305,THE WISH HOUSE,
3306,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Well, I never!” said Mrs. Fettley. “Did--did ye foller it up, anyways?”"
3307,THE WISH HOUSE,
3308,THE WISH HOUSE,"“She askt me to, but I wouldn’t ’ave no such dealin’s with a child.”"
3309,THE WISH HOUSE,
3310,THE WISH HOUSE,"“What _did_ ye do, then?”"
3311,THE WISH HOUSE,
3312,THE WISH HOUSE,“’Sat in me own room ’stid o’ the kitchen when me ’eddicks come on. But
3313,THE WISH HOUSE,it lay at de back o’ me mind.”
3314,THE WISH HOUSE,
3315,THE WISH HOUSE,"“’Twould. Did she tell ye more, ever?”"
3316,THE WISH HOUSE,
3317,THE WISH HOUSE,"“No. Besides what the Gippo girl ’ad told ’er, she knew naught, ’cept"
3318,THE WISH HOUSE,"that the charm worked. An’, next after that--in May ’twas--I suffered"
3319,THE WISH HOUSE,"the summer out in Lunnon. ’Twas hot an’ windy for weeks, an’ the"
3320,THE WISH HOUSE,streets stinkin’ o’ dried ’orse-dung blowin’ from side to side an’
3321,THE WISH HOUSE,lyin’ level with the kerb. We don’t get that nowadays. I ’ad my ’ol’day
3322,THE WISH HOUSE,"just before hoppin’,[2] an’ come down ’ere to stay with Bessie again."
3323,THE WISH HOUSE,"She noticed I’d lost flesh, an’ was all poochy under the eyes.”"
3324,THE WISH HOUSE,
3325,THE WISH HOUSE,“Did ye see ’Arry?”
3326,THE WISH HOUSE,
3327,THE WISH HOUSE,"Mrs. Ashcroft nodded. “The fourth--no, the fifth day. Wednesday ’twas."
3328,THE WISH HOUSE,I knowed ’e was workin’ at Smalldene again. I asked ’is mother in the
3329,THE WISH HOUSE,"street, bold as brass. She ’adn’t room to say much, for Bessie--you"
3330,THE WISH HOUSE,"know ’er tongue--was talkin’ full-clack. But that Wednesday, I was"
3331,THE WISH HOUSE,"walkin’ with one o’ Bessie’s chillern hangin’ on me skirts, at de back"
3332,THE WISH HOUSE,"o’ Chanter’s Tot. Prasin’ly, I felt ’e was be’ind me on the footpath,"
3333,THE WISH HOUSE,"an’ I knowed by ’is tread ’e’d changed ’is nature. I slowed, an’ I"
3334,THE WISH HOUSE,"heard ’im slow. Then I fussed a piece with the child, to force him past"
3335,THE WISH HOUSE,"me, like. So ’e _’ad_ to come past. ’E just says ‘Good-evenin’,’ and"
3336,THE WISH HOUSE,"goes on, tryin’ to pull ’isself together.”"
3337,THE WISH HOUSE,
3338,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Drunk, was he?” Mrs. Fettley asked."
3339,THE WISH HOUSE,
3340,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Never! S’runk an’ wizen; ’is clothes ’angin’ on ’im like bags, an’"
3341,THE WISH HOUSE,the back of ’is neck whiter’n chalk. ’Twas all I could do not to oppen
3342,THE WISH HOUSE,my arms an’ cry after him. But I swallered me spittle till I was back
3343,THE WISH HOUSE,"’ome again an’ the chillern abed. Then I says to Bessie, after supper,"
3344,THE WISH HOUSE,‘What in de world’s come to ’Arry Mockler?’ Bessie told me ’e’d been
3345,THE WISH HOUSE,"a-Hospital for two months, ’long o’ cuttin’ ’is foot wid a spade,"
3346,THE WISH HOUSE,"muckin’ out the old pond at Smalldene. There was poison in de dirt,"
3347,THE WISH HOUSE,"an’ it rooshed up ’is leg, like, an’ come out all over him. ’E ’adn’t"
3348,THE WISH HOUSE,been back to ’is job--carterin’ at Smalldene--more’n a fortnight. She
3349,THE WISH HOUSE,"told me the Doctor said he’d go off, likely, with the November frostes;"
3350,THE WISH HOUSE,"an’ ’is mother ’ad told ’er that ’e didn’t rightly eat nor sleep, an’"
3351,THE WISH HOUSE,"sweated ’imself into pools, no odds ’ow chill ’e lay. An’ spit terrible"
3352,THE WISH HOUSE,"o’ mornin’s. ‘Dearie me,’ I says. ‘But, mebbe hoppin’ ’ll set ’im right"
3353,THE WISH HOUSE,"again,’ an’ I licked me thread-point an’ I fetched me needle’s eye up"
3354,THE WISH HOUSE,"to it an’ I threads me needle under de lamp, steady as rocks. An’ dat"
3355,THE WISH HOUSE,night (me bed was in de wash-house) I cried an’ I cried. An’ _you_
3356,THE WISH HOUSE,"know, Liz--for you’ve been with me in my throes--it takes summat to"
3357,THE WISH HOUSE,make me cry.”
3358,THE WISH HOUSE,
3359,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Yes; but chile-bearin’ is on’y just pain,” said Mrs. Fettley."
3360,THE WISH HOUSE,
3361,THE WISH HOUSE,"“I come round by cock-crow, an’ dabbed cold tea on me eyes to take away"
3362,THE WISH HOUSE,the signs. Long towards nex’ evenin’--I was settin’ out to lay some
3363,THE WISH HOUSE,"flowers on me ’usband’s grave, for the look o’ the thing--I met ’Arry"
3364,THE WISH HOUSE,over against where the War Memorial is now. ’E was comin’ back from
3365,THE WISH HOUSE,"’is ’orses, so ’e couldn’t _not_ see me. I looked ’im all over, an’"
3366,THE WISH HOUSE,"‘’Arry,’ I says twix’ me teeth, ‘come back an’ rest-up in Lunnon.’ ‘I"
3367,THE WISH HOUSE,"won’t take it,’ he says, ‘for I can give ye naught.’ ‘I don’t ask it,’"
3368,THE WISH HOUSE,"I says. ‘By God’s Own Name, I don’t ask na’un! On’y come up an’ see a"
3369,THE WISH HOUSE,"Lunnon doctor.’ ’E lifts ’is two ’eavy eyes at me: ‘’Tis past that,"
3370,THE WISH HOUSE,"Gra’,’ ’e says. ‘I’ve but a few months left.’ ‘’Arry!’ I says. ‘_My_"
3371,THE WISH HOUSE,man!’ I says. I couldn’t say no more. ’Twas all up in me throat. ‘Thank
3372,THE WISH HOUSE,"ye kindly, Gra’,’ ’e says (but ’e never says ‘my woman’), an’ ’e went"
3373,THE WISH HOUSE,"on up-street an’ ’is mother--Oh, damn ’er!--she was watchin’ for ’im,"
3374,THE WISH HOUSE,an’ she shut de door be’ind ’im.”
3375,THE WISH HOUSE,
3376,THE WISH HOUSE,"Mrs. Fettley stretched an arm across the table, and made to finger Mrs."
3377,THE WISH HOUSE,"Ashcroft’s sleeve at the wrist, but the other moved it out of reach."
3378,THE WISH HOUSE,
3379,THE WISH HOUSE,"“So I went on to the churchyard with my flowers, an’ I remembered my"
3380,THE WISH HOUSE,"’usband’s warnin’ that night he spoke. ’E _was_ death-wise, an’ it"
3381,THE WISH HOUSE,_’ad_ ’appened as ’e said. But as I was settin’ down de jam-pot on
3382,THE WISH HOUSE,"the grave-mound, it come over me there was one thing I _could_ do for"
3383,THE WISH HOUSE,"’Arry. Doctor or no Doctor, I thought I’d make a trial of it. So I"
3384,THE WISH HOUSE,"did. Nex’ mornin’, a bill came down from our Lunnon green-grocer. Mrs."
3385,THE WISH HOUSE,"Marshall, she’d lef’ me petty cash for suchlike--o’ course--but I tole"
3386,THE WISH HOUSE,"Bess ’twas for me to come an’ open the ’ouse. So I went up, afternoon"
3387,THE WISH HOUSE,train.”
3388,THE WISH HOUSE,
3389,THE WISH HOUSE,“An’--but I know you ’adn’t--’adn’t you no fear?”
3390,THE WISH HOUSE,
3391,THE WISH HOUSE,“What for? There was nothin’ front o’ me but my own shame an’ God’s
3392,THE WISH HOUSE,croolty. I couldn’t ever get ’Arry--’ow _could_ I? I knowed it must go
3393,THE WISH HOUSE,on burnin’ till it burned me out.”
3394,THE WISH HOUSE,
3395,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Aie!” said Mrs. Fettley, reaching for the wrist again, and this time"
3396,THE WISH HOUSE,Mrs. Ashcroft permitted it.
3397,THE WISH HOUSE,
3398,THE WISH HOUSE,“Yit ’twas a comfort to know I could try _this_ for ’im. So I went an’
3399,THE WISH HOUSE,"I paid the green-grocer’s bill, an’ put ’is receipt in me hand-bag, an’"
3400,THE WISH HOUSE,then I stepped round to Mrs. Ellis--our char--an’ got the ’ouse-keys
3401,THE WISH HOUSE,"an’ opened the ’ouse. First, I made me bed to come back to (God’s Own"
3402,THE WISH HOUSE,Name! Me bed to lie upon!). Nex’ I made me a cup o’ tea an’ sat down
3403,THE WISH HOUSE,"in the kitchen thinkin’, till ’long towards dusk. Terrible close,"
3404,THE WISH HOUSE,"’twas. Then I dressed me an’ went out with the receipt in me ’and-bag,"
3405,THE WISH HOUSE,"feignin’ to study it for an address, like. Fourteen, Wadloes Road, was"
3406,THE WISH HOUSE,"the place--a liddle basement-kitchen ’ouse, in a row of twenty-thirty"
3407,THE WISH HOUSE,"such, an’ tiddy strips o’ walled garden in front--the paint off the"
3408,THE WISH HOUSE,"front doors, an’ na’un done to na’un since ever so long. There wasn’t"
3409,THE WISH HOUSE,"’ardly no one in the streets ’cept the cats. _’Twas_ ’ot, too! I turned"
3410,THE WISH HOUSE,into the gate bold as brass; up de steps I went an’ I ringed the
3411,THE WISH HOUSE,"front-door bell. She pealed loud, like it do in an empty house. When"
3412,THE WISH HOUSE,"she’d all ceased, I ’eard a cheer, like, pushed back on de floor o’ the"
3413,THE WISH HOUSE,"kitchen. Then I ’eard feet on de kitchen-stairs, like it might ha’ been"
3414,THE WISH HOUSE,"a heavy woman in slippers. They come up to de stairhead, acrost the"
3415,THE WISH HOUSE,hall--I ’eard the bare boards creak under ’em--an’ at de front door dey
3416,THE WISH HOUSE,"stopped. I stooped me to the letter-box slit, an’ I says: ‘Let me take"
3417,THE WISH HOUSE,"everythin’ bad that’s in store for my man, ’Arry Mockler, for love’s"
3418,THE WISH HOUSE,"sake.’ Then, whatever it was t’other side de door let its breath out,"
3419,THE WISH HOUSE,"like, as if it ’ad been holdin’ it for to ’ear better.”"
3420,THE WISH HOUSE,
3421,THE WISH HOUSE,“Nothin’ was _said_ to ye?” Mrs. Fettley demanded.
3422,THE WISH HOUSE,
3423,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Na’un. She just breathed out--a sort of _A-ah_, like. Then the steps"
3424,THE WISH HOUSE,went back an’ down-stairs to the kitchen--all draggy--an’ I heard the
3425,THE WISH HOUSE,cheer drawed up again.”
3426,THE WISH HOUSE,
3427,THE WISH HOUSE,"“An’ you abode on de doorstep, throughout all, Gra’?”"
3428,THE WISH HOUSE,
3429,THE WISH HOUSE,Mrs. Ashcroft nodded.
3430,THE WISH HOUSE,
3431,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Then I went away, an’ a man passin’ says to me: ‘Didn’t you know"
3432,THE WISH HOUSE,"that house was empty?’ ‘No,’ I says. ‘I must ha’ been give the wrong"
3433,THE WISH HOUSE,"number.’ An’ I went back to our ’ouse, an’ I went to bed; for I was"
3434,THE WISH HOUSE,"fair flogged out. ’Twas too ’ot to sleep more’n snatches, so I walked"
3435,THE WISH HOUSE,"me about, lyin’ down betweens, till crack o’ dawn. Then I went to the"
3436,THE WISH HOUSE,"kitchen to make me a cup o’ tea, an’ I hitted meself just above the"
3437,THE WISH HOUSE,ankle on an old roastin’-jack o’ mine that Mrs. Ellis had moved out
3438,THE WISH HOUSE,"from the corner, her last cleanin’. An’ so--nex’ after that--I waited"
3439,THE WISH HOUSE,till the Marshalls come back o’ their holiday.”
3440,THE WISH HOUSE,
3441,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Alone there? I’d ha’ thought you’d ’ad enough of empty houses,” said"
3442,THE WISH HOUSE,"Mrs. Fettley, horrified."
3443,THE WISH HOUSE,
3444,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Oh, Mrs. Ellis an’ Sophy was runnin’ in an’ out soon’s I was back,"
3445,THE WISH HOUSE,an’ ’twixt us we cleaned de house again top-to-bottom. There’s allus
3446,THE WISH HOUSE,a hand’s turn more to do in every house. An’ that’s ’ow ’twas with me
3447,THE WISH HOUSE,"that autumn an’ winter, in Lunnon.”"
3448,THE WISH HOUSE,
3449,THE WISH HOUSE,“Then na’un hap--overtook ye for your doin’s?”
3450,THE WISH HOUSE,
3451,THE WISH HOUSE,Mrs. Ashcroft smiled. “No. Not then. ’Long in November I sent Bessie
3452,THE WISH HOUSE,ten shillin’s.”
3453,THE WISH HOUSE,
3454,THE WISH HOUSE,"“You was allus free-’anded,” Mrs. Fettley interrupted."
3455,THE WISH HOUSE,
3456,THE WISH HOUSE,"“An’ I got what I paid for, with the rest o’ the news. She said the"
3457,THE WISH HOUSE,"hoppin’ ’ad set ’im up wonderful. ’E’d ’ad six weeks of it, and now"
3458,THE WISH HOUSE,’e was back again carterin’ at Smalldene. No odds to me _’ow_ it ’ad
3459,THE WISH HOUSE,’appened--’slong’s it _’ad_. But I dunno as my ten shillin’s eased me
3460,THE WISH HOUSE,"much. ’Arry bein’ _dead_, like, ’e’d ha’ been mine, till Judgment."
3461,THE WISH HOUSE,"’Arry bein’ alive, ’e’d like as not pick up with some woman middlin’"
3462,THE WISH HOUSE,"quick. I raged over that. Come spring, I ’ad somethin’ else to rage"
3463,THE WISH HOUSE,"for. I’d growed a nasty little weepin’ boil, like, on me shin, just"
3464,THE WISH HOUSE,"above the boot-top, that wouldn’t heal no shape. It made me sick to"
3465,THE WISH HOUSE,"look at it, for I’m clean-fleshed by nature. Chop me all over with"
3466,THE WISH HOUSE,"a spade, an’ I’d heal like turf. Then Mrs. Marshall she set ’er own"
3467,THE WISH HOUSE,"doctor at me. ’E said I ought to ha’ come to him at first go-off,"
3468,THE WISH HOUSE,’stead o’ drawin’ all manner o’ dyed stockin’s over it for months. ’E
3469,THE WISH HOUSE,"said I’d stood up too much to me work, for it was settin’ very close"
3470,THE WISH HOUSE,"atop of a big swelled vein, like, behither the small o’ me ankle. ‘Slow"
3471,THE WISH HOUSE,"come, slow go,’ ’e says. ‘Lay your leg up on high an’ rest it,’ he"
3472,THE WISH HOUSE,"says, ‘an’ ’twill ease off. Don’t let it close up too soon. You’ve got"
3473,THE WISH HOUSE,"a very fine leg, Mrs. Ashcroft,’ ’e says. An’ he put wet dressin’s on"
3474,THE WISH HOUSE,it.”
3475,THE WISH HOUSE,
3476,THE WISH HOUSE,“’E done right.” Mrs. Fettley spoke firmly. “Wet dressin’s to wet
3477,THE WISH HOUSE,"wounds. They draw de humours, same’s a lamp-wick draws de oil.”"
3478,THE WISH HOUSE,
3479,THE WISH HOUSE,“That’s true. An’ Mrs. Marshall was allus at me to make me set down
3480,THE WISH HOUSE,"more, an’ dat nigh healed it up. An’ then after a while they packed me"
3481,THE WISH HOUSE,off down to Bessie’s to finish the cure; for I ain’t the sort to sit
3482,THE WISH HOUSE,"down when I ought to stand up. You was back in the village then, Liz.”"
3483,THE WISH HOUSE,
3484,THE WISH HOUSE,"“I was. I was, but--never did I guess!”"
3485,THE WISH HOUSE,
3486,THE WISH HOUSE,“I didn’t desire ye to.” Mrs. Ashcroft smiled. “I saw ’Arry once or
3487,THE WISH HOUSE,"twice in de street, wonnerful fleshed up an’ restored back. Then, one"
3488,THE WISH HOUSE,"day I didn’t see ’im, an’ ’is mother told me one of ’is ’orses ’ad"
3489,THE WISH HOUSE,lashed out an’ caught ’im on the ’ip. So ’e was abed an’ middlin’
3490,THE WISH HOUSE,"painful. An’ Bessie, she says to his mother, ’twas a pity ’Arry ’adn’t"
3491,THE WISH HOUSE,a woman of ’is own to take the nursin’ off ’er. And the old lady _was_
3492,THE WISH HOUSE,mad! She told us that ’Arry ’ad never looked after any woman in ’is
3493,THE WISH HOUSE,"born days, an’ as long as she was atop the mowlds, she’d contrive for"
3494,THE WISH HOUSE,’im till ’er two ’ands dropped off. So I knowed she’d do watch-dog for
3495,THE WISH HOUSE,"me, ’thout askin’ for bones.”"
3496,THE WISH HOUSE,
3497,THE WISH HOUSE,Mrs. Fettley rocked with small laughter.
3498,THE WISH HOUSE,
3499,THE WISH HOUSE,"“That day,” Mrs. Ashcroft went on, “I’d stood on me feet nigh all the"
3500,THE WISH HOUSE,"time, watchin’ the doctor go in an’ out; for they thought it might be"
3501,THE WISH HOUSE,"’is ribs, too. That made my boil break again, issuin’ an’ weepin’. But"
3502,THE WISH HOUSE,"it turned out ’twadn’t ribs at all, an’ ’Arry ’ad a good night. When"
3503,THE WISH HOUSE,"I heard that, nex’ mornin’, I says to meself, ‘I won’t lay two an’"
3504,THE WISH HOUSE,"two together _yit_. I’ll keep me leg down a week, an’ see what comes"
3505,THE WISH HOUSE,"of it.’ It didn’t hurt me that day, to speak of--’seemed more to draw"
3506,THE WISH HOUSE,the strength out o’ me like--an’ ’Arry ’ad another good night. That
3507,THE WISH HOUSE,made me persevere; but I didn’t dare lay two an’ two together till the
3508,THE WISH HOUSE,"week-end, an’ then, ’Arry come forth e’en a’most ’imself again--na’un"
3509,THE WISH HOUSE,hurt outside ner in of him. I nigh fell on me knees in de wash-house
3510,THE WISH HOUSE,"when Bessie was up-street. ‘I’ve got ye now, my man,’ I says, ‘You’ll"
3511,THE WISH HOUSE,take your good from me ’thout knowin’ it till my life’s end. O God send
3512,THE WISH HOUSE,me long to live for ’Arry’s sake!’ I says. An’ I dunno that didn’t
3513,THE WISH HOUSE,still me ragin’s.”
3514,THE WISH HOUSE,
3515,THE WISH HOUSE,“For good?” Mrs. Fettley asked.
3516,THE WISH HOUSE,
3517,THE WISH HOUSE,"“They come back, plenty times, but, let be how ’twould, I knowed I"
3518,THE WISH HOUSE,was doin’ for ’im. I _knowed_ it. I took an’ worked me pains on an’
3519,THE WISH HOUSE,"off, like regulatin’ my own range, till I learned to ’ave ’em at my"
3520,THE WISH HOUSE,"commandments. An’ that was funny, too. There was times, Liz, when my"
3521,THE WISH HOUSE,"trouble ’ud all s’rink an’ dry up, like. First, I used to try an’ fetch"
3522,THE WISH HOUSE,it on again; bein’ fearful to leave ’Arry alone too long for anythin’
3523,THE WISH HOUSE,to lay ’old of. Prasin’ly I come to see that was a sign he’d do all
3524,THE WISH HOUSE,"right awhile, an’ so I saved myself.”"
3525,THE WISH HOUSE,
3526,THE WISH HOUSE,"“’Ow long for?” Mrs. Fettley asked, with deepest interest."
3527,THE WISH HOUSE,
3528,THE WISH HOUSE,“I’ve gone de better part of a year onct or twice with na’un more to
3529,THE WISH HOUSE,"show than the liddle weepin’ core of it, like. _All_ s’rinked up an’"
3530,THE WISH HOUSE,dried off. Then he’d inflame up--for a warnin’--an’ I’d suffer it.
3531,THE WISH HOUSE,When I couldn’t no more--an’ I _’ad_ to keep on goin’ with my Lunnon
3532,THE WISH HOUSE,work--I’d lay me leg high on a cheer till it eased. Not too quick. I
3533,THE WISH HOUSE,"knowed by the feel of it, those times, dat ’Arry was in need. Then I’d"
3534,THE WISH HOUSE,"send another five shillin’s to Bess, or somethin’ for the chillern, to"
3535,THE WISH HOUSE,"find out if, mebbe, ’e’d took any hurt through my neglects. ’Twas _so_!"
3536,THE WISH HOUSE,"Year in, year out, I worked it dat way, Liz, an’ ’e got ’is good from"
3537,THE WISH HOUSE,me ’thout knowin’--for years and years.”
3538,THE WISH HOUSE,
3539,THE WISH HOUSE,"“But what did _you_ get out of it, Gra’?” Mrs. Fettley almost wailed."
3540,THE WISH HOUSE,“Did ye see ’im reg’lar?”
3541,THE WISH HOUSE,
3542,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Times--when I was ’ere on me ’ol’days. An’ more, now that I’m ’ere"
3543,THE WISH HOUSE,"for good. But ’e’s never looked at me, ner any other woman ’cept ’is"
3544,THE WISH HOUSE,mother. ’Ow I used to watch an’ listen! So did she.”
3545,THE WISH HOUSE,
3546,THE WISH HOUSE,“Years an’ years!” Mrs. Fettley repeated. “An’ where’s ’e workin’ at
3547,THE WISH HOUSE,now?”
3548,THE WISH HOUSE,
3549,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Oh, ’e’s give up carterin’ quite a while. He’s workin’ for one o’ them"
3550,THE WISH HOUSE,"big tractorisin’ firms--ploughin’ sometimes, an’ sometimes off with"
3551,THE WISH HOUSE,"lorries--fur as Wales, I’ve ’eard. He comes ’ome to ’is mother ’tween"
3552,THE WISH HOUSE,"whiles; but I don’t set eyes on him now, fer weeks on end. No odds!"
3553,THE WISH HOUSE,’Is job keeps ’im from continuin’ in one stay anywheres.”
3554,THE WISH HOUSE,
3555,THE WISH HOUSE,“But--just for de sake o’ saying’ somethin’--s’pose ’Arry _did_ get
3556,THE WISH HOUSE,married?” said Mrs. Fettley.
3557,THE WISH HOUSE,
3558,THE WISH HOUSE,Mrs. Ashcroft drew her breath sharply between her still even and
3559,THE WISH HOUSE,"natural teeth. “_Dat_ ain’t been required of me,” she answered. “I"
3560,THE WISH HOUSE,"reckon my pains ’ull be counted agin that. Don’t _you_, Liz?”"
3561,THE WISH HOUSE,
3562,THE WISH HOUSE,"“It ought to be, dearie. It ought to be.”"
3563,THE WISH HOUSE,
3564,THE WISH HOUSE,“It _do_ ’urt sometimes. You shall see it when Nurse comes. She thinks
3565,THE WISH HOUSE,I don’t know it’s turned.”
3566,THE WISH HOUSE,
3567,THE WISH HOUSE,Mrs. Fettley understood. Human nature seldom walks up to the word
3568,THE WISH HOUSE,“cancer.”
3569,THE WISH HOUSE,
3570,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Be ye certain sure, Gra’?” she asked."
3571,THE WISH HOUSE,
3572,THE WISH HOUSE,“I was sure of it when old Mr. Marshall ’ad me up to ’is study an’
3573,THE WISH HOUSE,spoke a long piece about my faithful service. I’ve obliged ’em on an’
3574,THE WISH HOUSE,"off for a goodish time, but not enough for a pension. But they give me"
3575,THE WISH HOUSE,a weekly ’lowance for life. I knew what _that_ sinnified--as long as
3576,THE WISH HOUSE,three years ago.”
3577,THE WISH HOUSE,
3578,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Dat don’t _prove_ it, Gra’.”"
3579,THE WISH HOUSE,
3580,THE WISH HOUSE,“To give fifteen bob a week to a woman ’oo’d live twenty year in the
3581,THE WISH HOUSE,course o’ nature? It _do_!”
3582,THE WISH HOUSE,
3583,THE WISH HOUSE,“You’re mistook! You’re mistook!” Mrs. Fettley insisted.
3584,THE WISH HOUSE,
3585,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Liz, there’s _no_ mistakin’ when the edges are all heaped up,"
3586,THE WISH HOUSE,"like--same as a collar. You’ll see it. An’ I laid out Dora Wickwood,"
3587,THE WISH HOUSE,"too. _She_ ’ad it under the arm-pit, like.”"
3588,THE WISH HOUSE,
3589,THE WISH HOUSE,"Mrs. Fettley considered awhile, and bowed her head in finality."
3590,THE WISH HOUSE,
3591,THE WISH HOUSE,"“’Ow long d’you reckon ’twill allow ye, countin’ from now, dearie?”"
3592,THE WISH HOUSE,
3593,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Slow come, slow go. But if I don’t set eyes on ye ’fore next hoppin’,"
3594,THE WISH HOUSE,"this’ll be good-bye, Liz.”"
3595,THE WISH HOUSE,
3596,THE WISH HOUSE,“Dunno as I’ll be able to manage by then--not ’thout I have a liddle
3597,THE WISH HOUSE,"dog to lead me. For de chillern, dey won’t be troubled, an’--O"
3598,THE WISH HOUSE,Gra’!--I’m blindin’ up--I’m blindin’ up!”
3599,THE WISH HOUSE,
3600,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Oh, _dat_ was why you didn’t more’n finger with your quilt-patches"
3601,THE WISH HOUSE,"all this while! I was wonderin’.... But the pain _do_ count, don’t ye"
3602,THE WISH HOUSE,"think, Liz? The pain _do_ count to keep ’Arry--where I want ’im. Say it"
3603,THE WISH HOUSE,"can’t be wasted, like.”"
3604,THE WISH HOUSE,
3605,THE WISH HOUSE,"“I’m sure of it--sure of it, dearie. You’ll ’ave your reward.”"
3606,THE WISH HOUSE,
3607,THE WISH HOUSE,“I don’t want no more’n this--_if_ de pain is taken into de reckonin’.”
3608,THE WISH HOUSE,
3609,THE WISH HOUSE,"“’Twill be--’twill be, Gra’.”"
3610,THE WISH HOUSE,
3611,THE WISH HOUSE,There was a knock on the door.
3612,THE WISH HOUSE,
3613,THE WISH HOUSE,"“That’s Nurse. She’s before ’er time,” said Mrs. Ashcroft. “Open to"
3614,THE WISH HOUSE,’er.”
3615,THE WISH HOUSE,
3616,THE WISH HOUSE,"The young lady entered briskly, all the bottles in her bag clicking."
3617,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Evenin’, Mrs. Ashcroft,” she began. “I’ve come raound a little earlier"
3618,THE WISH HOUSE,"than usual because of the Institute dance to-na-ite. You won’t ma-ind,"
3619,THE WISH HOUSE,will you?”
3620,THE WISH HOUSE,
3621,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Oh, no. Me dancin’ days are over.” Mrs. Ashcroft was the"
3622,THE WISH HOUSE,"self-contained domestic at once. “My old friend, Mrs. Fettley ’ere, has"
3623,THE WISH HOUSE,been settin’ talkin’ with me a while.”
3624,THE WISH HOUSE,
3625,THE WISH HOUSE,“I hope she ’asn’t been fatiguing you?” said the Nurse a little
3626,THE WISH HOUSE,frostily.
3627,THE WISH HOUSE,
3628,THE WISH HOUSE,“Quite the contrary. It ’as been a pleasure. Only--only--just at the
3629,THE WISH HOUSE,"end I felt a bit--a bit flogged out, like.”"
3630,THE WISH HOUSE,
3631,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Yes, yes.” The Nurse was on her knees already, with the washes to"
3632,THE WISH HOUSE,"hand. “When old ladies get together they talk a deal too much, I’ve"
3633,THE WISH HOUSE,noticed.”
3634,THE WISH HOUSE,
3635,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Mebbe we do,” said Mrs. Fettley, rising. “So, now, I’ll make myself"
3636,THE WISH HOUSE,scarce.”
3637,THE WISH HOUSE,
3638,THE WISH HOUSE,"“Look at it first, though,” said Mrs. Ashcroft feebly. “I’d like ye to"
3639,THE WISH HOUSE,look at it.”
3640,THE WISH HOUSE,
3641,THE WISH HOUSE,"Mrs. Fettley looked, and shivered. Then she leaned over, and kissed"
3642,THE WISH HOUSE,"Mrs. Ashcroft once on the waxy yellow forehead, and again on the faded"
3643,THE WISH HOUSE,grey eyes.
3644,THE WISH HOUSE,
3645,THE WISH HOUSE,"“It _do_ count, don’t it--de pain?” The lips that still kept trace of"
3646,THE WISH HOUSE,their original moulding hardly more than breathed the words.
3647,THE WISH HOUSE,
3648,THE WISH HOUSE,Mrs. Fettley kissed them and moved towards the door.

3764,THE JANEITES,In the Lodge of Instruction attached to “Faith and Works No. 5837 E.
3765,THE JANEITES,"C.,” which has already been described, Saturday afternoon was appointed"
3766,THE JANEITES,"for the weekly clean-up, when all visiting Brethren were welcome to"
3767,THE JANEITES,help under the direction of the Lodge Officer of the day: their reward
3768,THE JANEITES,was light refreshment and the meeting of companions.
3769,THE JANEITES,
3770,THE JANEITES,"This particular afternoon--in the autumn of ’20--Brother Burges, P."
3771,THE JANEITES,"M., was on duty and, finding a strong shift present, took advantage"
3772,THE JANEITES,"of it to strip and dust all hangings and curtains, to go over every"
3773,THE JANEITES,"inch of the Pavement--which was stone, not floorcloth--by hand; and to"
3774,THE JANEITES,"polish the Columns, Jewels, Working outfit and organ. I was given to"
3775,THE JANEITES,clean some Officer’s Jewels--beautiful bits of old Georgian silver-work
3776,THE JANEITES,humanised by generations of elbow-grease--and retired to the organ
3777,THE JANEITES,loft; for the floor was like the quarter-deck of a battleship on the
3778,THE JANEITES,eve of a ball. Half-a-dozen brethren had already made the Pavement as
3779,THE JANEITES,glassy as the aisle of Greenwich Chapel; the brazen chapiters winked
3780,THE JANEITES,like pure gold at the flashing Marks on the Chairs; and a morose
3781,THE JANEITES,"one-legged brother was attending to the Emblems of Mortality with, I"
3782,THE JANEITES,"think, rouge."
3783,THE JANEITES,
3784,THE JANEITES,"“They ought,” he volunteered to Brother Burges as we passed, “to be"
3785,THE JANEITES,betwixt the colour of ripe apricots an’ a half-smoked meerschaum.
3786,THE JANEITES,That’s how we kept ’em in my Mother-Lodge--a treat to look at.”
3787,THE JANEITES,
3788,THE JANEITES,"“I’ve never seen spit-and-polish to touch this,” I said."
3789,THE JANEITES,
3790,THE JANEITES,"“Wait till you see the organ,” Brother Burges replied. “You could shave"
3791,THE JANEITES,in it when they’ve done. Brother Anthony’s in charge up there--the
3792,THE JANEITES,taxi-owner you met here last month. I don’t think you’ve come across
3793,THE JANEITES,"Brother Humberstall, have you?”"
3794,THE JANEITES,
3795,THE JANEITES,“I don’t remember----” I began.
3796,THE JANEITES,
3797,THE JANEITES,"“You wouldn’t have forgotten him if you had. He’s a hairdresser now,"
3798,THE JANEITES,somewhere at the back of Ebury Street. ’Was Garrison Artillery. ’Blown
3799,THE JANEITES,up twice.”
3800,THE JANEITES,
3801,THE JANEITES,“Does he show it?” I asked at the foot of the organ-loft stairs.
3802,THE JANEITES,
3803,THE JANEITES,"“No-o. Not much more than Lazarus did, I expect.” Brother Burges fled"
3804,THE JANEITES,off to set some one else to a job.
3805,THE JANEITES,
3806,THE JANEITES,"Brother Anthony, small, dark, and hump-backed, was hissing"
3807,THE JANEITES,groom-fashion while he treated the rich acacia-wood panels of the
3808,THE JANEITES,"Lodge organ with some sacred, secret composition of his own. Under"
3809,THE JANEITES,"his guidance Humberstall, an enormous, flat-faced man, carrying"
3810,THE JANEITES,"the shoulders, ribs, and loins of the old Mark ’14 Royal Garrison"
3811,THE JANEITES,"Artillery, and the eyes of a bewildered retriever, rubbed the stuff in."
3812,THE JANEITES,"I sat down to my task on the organ-bench, whose purple velvet cushion"
3813,THE JANEITES,was being vacuum-cleaned on the floor below.
3814,THE JANEITES,
3815,THE JANEITES,"“Now,” said Anthony, after five minutes’ vigorous work on the part of"
3816,THE JANEITES,Humberstall. “_Now_ we’re gettin’ somethin’ worth lookin’ at! Take it
3817,THE JANEITES,"easy, an’ go on with what you was tellin’ me about that Macklin man.”"
3818,THE JANEITES,
3819,THE JANEITES,"“I--I ’adn’t anything against ’im,” said Humberstall, “excep’ he’d been"
3820,THE JANEITES,a toff by birth; but that never showed till he was bosko absoluto. Mere
3821,THE JANEITES,"bein’ drunk on’y made a common ’ound of ’im. But when bosko, it all"
3822,THE JANEITES,"came out. Otherwise, he showed me my duties as mess-waiter very well on"
3823,THE JANEITES,the ’ole.”
3824,THE JANEITES,
3825,THE JANEITES,"“Yes, yes. But what in ’ell made you go _back_ to your Circus? The"
3826,THE JANEITES,"Board gave you down-an’-out fair enough, you said, after the dump went"
3827,THE JANEITES,up at Eatables?”
3828,THE JANEITES,
3829,THE JANEITES,"“Board or no Board, _I_ ’adn’t the nerve to stay at ’ome--not with"
3830,THE JANEITES,mother chuckin’ ’erself round all three rooms like a rabbit every time
3831,THE JANEITES,the Gothas tried to get Victoria; an’ sister writin’ me aunts four
3832,THE JANEITES,"pages about it next day. Not for _me_, thank you! till the war was"
3833,THE JANEITES,"over. So I slid out with a draft--they wasn’t particular in ’17, so"
3834,THE JANEITES,long as the tally was correct--and I joined up again with our Circus
3835,THE JANEITES,"somewhere at the back of Lar Pug Noy, I think it was.” Humberstall"
3836,THE JANEITES,"paused for some seconds and his brow wrinkled. “Then I--I went sick,"
3837,THE JANEITES,"or somethin’ or other, they told me; but I know _when_ I reported"
3838,THE JANEITES,"for duty, our Battery Sergeant Major says that I wasn’t expected"
3839,THE JANEITES,"back, an’--an’, one thing leadin’ to another--to cut a long story"
3840,THE JANEITES,short--I went up before our Major--Major--I shall forget my own name
3841,THE JANEITES,next--Major----”
3842,THE JANEITES,
3843,THE JANEITES,"“Never mind,” Anthony interrupted. “Go on! It’ll come back in talk!”"
3844,THE JANEITES,
3845,THE JANEITES,“’Alf a mo’. ’Twas on the tip o’ my tongue then.”
3846,THE JANEITES,
3847,THE JANEITES,Humberstall dropped the polishing-cloth and knitted his brows again in
3848,THE JANEITES,most profound thought. Anthony turned to me and suddenly launched into
3849,THE JANEITES,a sprightly tale of his taxi’s collision with a Marble Arch refuge on a
3850,THE JANEITES,greasy day after a three-yard skid.
3851,THE JANEITES,
3852,THE JANEITES,“’Much damage?” I asked.
3853,THE JANEITES,
3854,THE JANEITES,“Oh no! Ev’ry bolt an’ screw an’ nut on the chassis strained; _but_
3855,THE JANEITES,"nothing carried away, you understand me, an’ not a scratch on the body."
3856,THE JANEITES,You’d never ’ave guessed a thing wrong till you took ’er in hand. It
3857,THE JANEITES,_was_ a wop too: ’ead-on--like this!” And he slapped his tactful
3858,THE JANEITES,little forehead to show what a knock it had been.
3859,THE JANEITES,
3860,THE JANEITES,“Did your Major dish you up much?” he went on over his shoulder to
3861,THE JANEITES,Humberstall who came out of his abstraction with a slow heave.
3862,THE JANEITES,
3863,THE JANEITES,“We-ell! He told me I wasn’t expected back either; an’ he said ’e
3864,THE JANEITES,couldn’t ’ang up the ’ole Circus till I’d rejoined; an’ he said that my
3865,THE JANEITES,"ten-inch Skoda which I’d been Number Three of, before the dump went up"
3866,THE JANEITES,"at Eatables, had ’er full crowd. But, ’e said, as soon as a casualty"
3867,THE JANEITES,"occurred he’d remember me. ‘Meantime,’ says he, ‘I particularly want"
3868,THE JANEITES,you for actin’ mess-waiter.’
3869,THE JANEITES,
3870,THE JANEITES,"“’Beggin’ your pardon, sir,’ I says perfectly respectful; ‘but I didn’t"
3871,THE JANEITES,"exactly come back for _that_, sir.’”"
3872,THE JANEITES,
3873,THE JANEITES,"“‘Beggin’ _your_ pardon, ’Umberstall,’ says ’e, ‘but I ’appen to"
3874,THE JANEITES,"command the Circus! Now, you’re a sharp-witted man,’ he says; ‘an’ what"
3875,THE JANEITES,we’ve suffered from fool-waiters in Mess ’as been somethin’ cruel.
3876,THE JANEITES,"You’ll take on, from now--under instruction to Macklin ’ere.’ So this"
3877,THE JANEITES,"man, Macklin, that I was tellin’ you about, showed me my duties...."
3878,THE JANEITES,"’Ammick! I’ve got it! ’Ammick was our Major, an’ Mosse was Captain!”"
3879,THE JANEITES,Humberstall celebrated his recapture of the name by labouring at the
3880,THE JANEITES,organ-panel on his knee.
3881,THE JANEITES,
3882,THE JANEITES,"“Look out! You’ll smash it,” Anthony protested."
3883,THE JANEITES,
3884,THE JANEITES,"“Sorry! Mother’s often told me I didn’t know my strength. Now,"
3885,THE JANEITES,here’s a curious thing. This Major of ours--it’s all comin’ back to
3886,THE JANEITES,"me--was a high-up divorce-court lawyer; an’ Mosse, our Captain, was"
3887,THE JANEITES,Number One o’ Mosse’s Private Detective Agency. You’ve heard of it?
3888,THE JANEITES,"’Wives watched while you wait, an’ so on. Well, these two ’ad been"
3889,THE JANEITES,"registerin’ together, so to speak, in the Civil line for years on end,"
3890,THE JANEITES,"but hadn’t ever met till the War. Consequently, at Mess their talk was"
3891,THE JANEITES,mostly about famous cases they’d been mixed up in. ’Ammick told the
3892,THE JANEITES,"Law-courts’ end o’ the business, an’ all what had been left out of"
3893,THE JANEITES,the pleadin’s; an’ Mosse ’ad the actual facts concernin’ the errin’
3894,THE JANEITES,parties--in hotels an’ so on. I’ve heard better talk in our Mess than
3895,THE JANEITES,ever before or since. It comes o’ the Gunners bein’ a scientific corps.”
3896,THE JANEITES,
3897,THE JANEITES,“That be damned!” said Anthony. “If anythin’ ’appens to ’em they’ve got
3898,THE JANEITES,it all down in a book. There’s no book when your lorry dies on you in
3899,THE JANEITES,the ’Oly Land. _That’s_ brains.”
3900,THE JANEITES,
3901,THE JANEITES,"“Well, _then_,” Humberstall continued, “come on this secret society"
3902,THE JANEITES,business that I started tellin’ you about. When those two--’Ammick an’
3903,THE JANEITES,"Mosse--’ad finished about their matrimonial relations--and mind you,"
3904,THE JANEITES,"they weren’t radishes--they seldom or ever repeated--they’d begin, as"
3905,THE JANEITES,"often as not, on this Secret Society woman I was tellin’ you of--this"
3906,THE JANEITES,Jane. She was the only woman I ever ’eard ’em say a good word for.
3907,THE JANEITES,’Cordin’ to them Jane was a none-such. _I_ didn’t know then she was
3908,THE JANEITES,"a Society. ’Fact is, I only ’ung out ’arf an ear in their direction"
3909,THE JANEITES,"at first, on account of bein’ under instruction for mess-duty to this"
3910,THE JANEITES,Macklin man. What drew _my_ attention to her was a new Lieutenant
3911,THE JANEITES,"joinin’ up. We called ’im ‘Gander’ on account of his profeel, which"
3912,THE JANEITES,was the identical bird. ’E’d been a nactuary--workin’ out ’ow long
3913,THE JANEITES,civilians ’ad to live. Neither ’Ammick nor Mosse wasted words on ’im
3914,THE JANEITES,"at Mess. They went on talking as usual, an’ in due time, _as_ usual,"
3915,THE JANEITES,they got back to Jane. Gander cocks one of his big chilblainy ears an’
3916,THE JANEITES,"cracks his cold finger-joints. ‘By God! Jane?’ says ’e. ‘Yes, Jane,’"
3917,THE JANEITES,says ’Ammick pretty short an’ senior. ‘Praise ’Eaven!’ says Gander. ‘It
3918,THE JANEITES,was “Bubbly” where I’ve come from down the line.’ (Some damn review or
3919,THE JANEITES,"other, I expect.) Well, neither ’Ammick nor Mosse was easy-mouthed,"
3920,THE JANEITES,or for that matter mealy-mouthed; but no sooner ’ad Gander passed that
3921,THE JANEITES,remark than they both shook ’ands with the young squirt across the
3922,THE JANEITES,"table an’ called for the port back again. It _was_ a password, all"
3923,THE JANEITES,"right! Then they went at it about Jane--all three, regardless of rank."
3924,THE JANEITES,"That made me listen. Presently, I ’eard ’Ammick say----”"
3925,THE JANEITES,
3926,THE JANEITES,"“’Arf a mo’,” Anthony cut in. “But what was _you_ doin’ in Mess?”"
3927,THE JANEITES,
3928,THE JANEITES,“Me an’ Macklin was refixin’ the sand-bag screens to the dug-out
3929,THE JANEITES,"passage in case o’ gas. We never knew when we’d cop it in the ’Eavies,"
3930,THE JANEITES,"don’t you see. But we knew we ’ad been looked for for some time, an’ it"
3931,THE JANEITES,"might come any minute. But, as I was sayin’, ’Ammick says what a pity"
3932,THE JANEITES,"’twas Jane ’ad died barren. ‘I deny that,’ says Mosse. ‘I maintain she"
3933,THE JANEITES,was fruitful in the ’ighest sense o’ the word.’ An’ Mosse knew about
3934,THE JANEITES,"such things, too. ‘I’m inclined to agree with ’Ammick,’ says young"
3935,THE JANEITES,"Gander. ‘Any’ow, she’s left no direct an’ lawful prog’ny.’ I remember"
3936,THE JANEITES,"every word they said, on account o’ what ’appened subsequently. I"
3937,THE JANEITES,"’adn’t noticed Macklin much, or I’d ha’ seen he was bosko absoluto."
3938,THE JANEITES,"Then _’e_ cut in, leanin’ over a packin’-case with a face on ’im like"
3939,THE JANEITES,"a dead mackerel in the dark. ‘Pahardon me, gents,’ Macklin says,"
3940,THE JANEITES,‘but this _is_ a matter on which I _do_ ’appen to be moderately
3941,THE JANEITES,well-informed. She _did_ leave lawful issue in the shape o’ one son;
3942,THE JANEITES,an’ ’is name was ’Enery James.’
3943,THE JANEITES,
3944,THE JANEITES,"“‘By what sire? Prove it,’ says Gander, before ’is senior officers"
3945,THE JANEITES,could get in a word.
3946,THE JANEITES,
3947,THE JANEITES,"“‘I will,’ says Macklin, surgin’ on ’is two thumbs. _An’_, mark you,"
3948,THE JANEITES,none of ’em spoke! I forget whom he said was the sire of this ’Enery
3949,THE JANEITES,James-man; but ’e delivered ’em a lecture on this Jane-woman for more
3950,THE JANEITES,"than a quarter of an hour. I know the exact time, because my old"
3951,THE JANEITES,Skoda was on duty at ten-minute intervals reachin’ after some Jerry
3952,THE JANEITES,formin’-up area; and her blast always put out the dug-out candles.
3953,THE JANEITES,"I relit ’em once, an’ again at the end. In conclusion, this Macklin"
3954,THE JANEITES,"fell flat forward on ’is face, which was how ’e generally wound up ’is"
3955,THE JANEITES,notion of a perfect day. Bosko absoluto!
3956,THE JANEITES,
3957,THE JANEITES,"“‘Take ’im away,’ says ’Ammick to me. ‘’E’s sufferin’ from shell-shock.’"
3958,THE JANEITES,
3959,THE JANEITES,"“To cut a long story short, _that_ was what first put the notion into"
3960,THE JANEITES,my ’ead. Wouldn’t it you? Even ’ad Macklin been a ’igh-up Mason----”
3961,THE JANEITES,
3962,THE JANEITES,"“Wasn’t ’e, then?” said Anthony, a little puzzled."
3963,THE JANEITES,
3964,THE JANEITES,"“’E’d never gone beyond the Blue Degrees, ’e told me. Any’ow, ’e’d"
3965,THE JANEITES,lectured ’is superior officers up an’ down; ’e’d as good as called ’em
3966,THE JANEITES,"fools most o’ the time, in ’is toff’s voice. I ’eard ’im an’ I saw ’im."
3967,THE JANEITES,An’ all he got was--me told off to put ’im to bed! And all on account
3968,THE JANEITES,"o’ Jane! Would _you_ have let a thing like that get past you? Nor me,"
3969,THE JANEITES,"either! Next mornin’, when his stummick was settled, I was at him"
3970,THE JANEITES,"full-cry to find out ’ow it was worked. Toff or no toff, ’e knew his"
3971,THE JANEITES,"end of a bargain. First, ’e wasn’t takin’ any. He said I wasn’t fit to"
3972,THE JANEITES,be initiated into the Society of the Janeites. That only meant five bob
3973,THE JANEITES,more--fifteen up to date.
3974,THE JANEITES,
3975,THE JANEITES,"“‘Make it one Bradbury,’ ’e says. ‘It’s dirt-cheap. You saw me ’old the"
3976,THE JANEITES,Circus in the ’ollow of me ’and?’
3977,THE JANEITES,
3978,THE JANEITES,"“No denyin’ it. I _’ad_. So, for one pound, he communicated me the"
3979,THE JANEITES,Pass-word of the First Degree which was _Tilniz an’ trap-doors_.
3980,THE JANEITES,
3981,THE JANEITES,"“‘I know what a trap-door is,’ I says to ’im, ‘but what in ’ell’s"
3982,THE JANEITES,_Tilniz_?’
3983,THE JANEITES,
3984,THE JANEITES,"“‘You obey orders,’ ’e says, ‘an’ next time I ask you what you’re"
3985,THE JANEITES,"thinkin’ about you’ll answer, “_Tilniz an’ trap-doors_,” in a smart"
3986,THE JANEITES,and soldierly manner. I’ll spring that question at me own time. All
3987,THE JANEITES,you’ve got to do is to be distinck.’
3988,THE JANEITES,
3989,THE JANEITES,“We settled all this while we was skinnin’ spuds for dinner at the
3990,THE JANEITES,"back o’ the rear-truck under our camouflage-screens. Gawd, ’ow that"
3991,THE JANEITES,"glue-paint did stink! Otherwise, ’twasn’t so bad, with the sun comin’"
3992,THE JANEITES,"through our pantomime-leaves, an’ the wind marcelling the grasses"
3993,THE JANEITES,"in the cutting. Well, one thing leading to another, nothin’ further"
3994,THE JANEITES,’appened in this direction till the afternoon. We ’ad a high standard
3995,THE JANEITES,"o’ livin’ in Mess--an’ in the Group, for that matter. I was takin’ away"
3996,THE JANEITES,Mosse’s lunch--dinner ’e would never call it--an’ Mosse was fillin’
3997,THE JANEITES,"’is cigarette-case previous to the afternoon’s duty. Macklin, in the"
3998,THE JANEITES,"passage, comin’ in as if ’e didn’t know Mosse was there, slings ’is"
3999,THE JANEITES,"question at me, an’ I give the countersign in a low but quite distinck"
4000,THE JANEITES,"voice, makin’ as if I ’adn’t seen Mosse. Mosse looked at me through and"
4001,THE JANEITES,"through, with his cigarette-case in his ’and. Then ’e jerks out ’arf a"
4002,THE JANEITES,dozen--best Turkish--on the table an’ exits. I pinched ’em an’ divvied
4003,THE JANEITES,with Macklin.
4004,THE JANEITES,
4005,THE JANEITES,"“‘You see ’ow it works,’ says Macklin. ‘Could you ’ave invested a"
4006,THE JANEITES,Bradbury to better advantage?’
4007,THE JANEITES,
4008,THE JANEITES,"“‘So far, no,’ I says. ‘Otherwise, though, if they start provin’ an’"
4009,THE JANEITES,"tryin’ me, I’m a dead bird. There must be a lot more to this Janeite"
4010,THE JANEITES,game.’
4011,THE JANEITES,
4012,THE JANEITES,"“’Eaps an’ ’eaps,’ he says. ‘But to show you the sort of ’eart I"
4013,THE JANEITES,"’ave, I’ll communicate you all the ’Igher Degrees among the Janeites,"
4014,THE JANEITES,"includin’ the Charges, for another Bradbury; but you’ll ’ave to work,"
4015,THE JANEITES,Dobbin.’”
4016,THE JANEITES,
4017,THE JANEITES,"“’Pretty free with your Bradburys, wasn’t you?” Anthony grunted"
4018,THE JANEITES,disapprovingly.
4019,THE JANEITES,
4020,THE JANEITES,"“What odds? _Ac-tually_, Gander told us, we couldn’t expect to av’rage"
4021,THE JANEITES,"more than six weeks’ longer apiece, an’, any’ow, _I_ never regretted"
4022,THE JANEITES,it. But make no mistake--the preparation was somethin’ cruel. In the
4023,THE JANEITES,"first place, I come under Macklin for direct instruction _re_ Jane.”"
4024,THE JANEITES,
4025,THE JANEITES,"“Oh! Jane _was_ real, then?” Anthony glanced for an instant at me as he"
4026,THE JANEITES,put the question. “I couldn’t quite make that out.”
4027,THE JANEITES,
4028,THE JANEITES,"“Real!” Humberstall’s voice rose almost to a treble. “Jane? Why, she"
4029,THE JANEITES,was a little old maid ’oo’d written ’alf a dozen books about a hundred
4030,THE JANEITES,years ago. ’Twasn’t as if there was anythin’ _to_ ’em either. _I_ know.
4031,THE JANEITES,"I had to read ’em. They weren’t adventurous, nor smutty, nor what you’d"
4032,THE JANEITES,call even interestin’--all about girls o’ seventeen (they begun young
4033,THE JANEITES,"then, I tell you), not certain ’oom they’d like to marry; an’ their"
4034,THE JANEITES,"dances an’ card-parties an’ picnics, and their young blokes goin’ off"
4035,THE JANEITES,to London on ’orseback for ’air-cuts an’ shaves. It took a full day in
4036,THE JANEITES,"those days, if you went to a proper barber. They wore wigs, too, when"
4037,THE JANEITES,they was chemists or clergymen. All that interested me on account o’ me
4038,THE JANEITES,"profession, an’ cuttin’ the men’s ’air every fortnight. Macklin used to"
4039,THE JANEITES,"chip me about bein’ an ’airdresser. ’E _could_ pass remarks, too!”"
4040,THE JANEITES,
4041,THE JANEITES,Humberstall recited with relish a fragment of what must have been
4042,THE JANEITES,"a superb commination-service, ending with, “You lazy-minded,"
4043,THE JANEITES,"lousy-headed, long-trousered, perfumed perookier.”"
4044,THE JANEITES,
4045,THE JANEITES,“An’ you took it?” Anthony’s quick eyes ran over the man.
4046,THE JANEITES,
4047,THE JANEITES,"“Yes. I was after my money’s worth; an’ Macklin, havin’ put ’is ’and"
4048,THE JANEITES,"to the plough, wasn’t one to withdraw it. Otherwise, if I’d pushed"
4049,THE JANEITES,"’im, I’d ha’ slew ’im. Our Battery Sergeant Major nearly did. For"
4050,THE JANEITES,Macklin had a wonderful way o’ passing remarks on a man’s civil life;
4051,THE JANEITES,an’ he put it about that our B. S. M. had run a dope an’ dolly-shop
4052,THE JANEITES,"with a Chinese woman, the wrong end o’ Southwark Bridge. Nothin’ you"
4053,THE JANEITES,"could lay ’old of, o’ course; but----” Humberstall let us draw our own"
4054,THE JANEITES,conclusions.
4055,THE JANEITES,
4056,THE JANEITES,"“That reminds me,” said Anthony, smacking his lips. “I ’ad a bit of"
4057,THE JANEITES,a fracas with a fare in the Fulham Road last month. He called me a
4058,THE JANEITES,"parastit-ic Forder. I informed ’im I was owner-driver, an’ ’e could see"
4059,THE JANEITES,for ’im-self the cab was quite clean. That didn’t suit ’im. ’E said it
4060,THE JANEITES,was crawlin’.”
4061,THE JANEITES,
4062,THE JANEITES,“What happened?” I asked.
4063,THE JANEITES,
4064,THE JANEITES,“One o’ them blue-bellied Bolshies of post-war Police (neglectin’
4065,THE JANEITES,"point-duty, as usual) asked us to flirt a little quieter. My joker"
4066,THE JANEITES,chucked some Arabic at ’im. That was when we signed the Armistice. ’E’d
4067,THE JANEITES,been a Yeoman--a perishin’ Gloucestershire Yeoman--that I’d helped
4068,THE JANEITES,"gather in the orange crop with at Jaffa, in the ’Oly Land!”"
4069,THE JANEITES,
4070,THE JANEITES,“And after that?” I continued.
4071,THE JANEITES,
4072,THE JANEITES,“It ’ud be ’ard to say. I know ’e lived at Hendon or Cricklewood. I
4073,THE JANEITES,"drove ’im there. We must ’ave talked Zionism or somethin’, because"
4074,THE JANEITES,at seven next mornin’ him an’ me was tryin’ to get petrol out of a
4075,THE JANEITES,milkshop at St. Albans. They ’adn’t any. In lots o’ ways this war has
4076,THE JANEITES,"been a public noosance, as one might say, but there’s no denyin’ it"
4077,THE JANEITES,’elps you slip through life easier. The dairyman’s son ’ad done time on
4078,THE JANEITES,Jordan with camels. So he stood us rum an’ milk.”
4079,THE JANEITES,
4080,THE JANEITES,"“Just like ’avin’ the Password, eh?” was Humberstall’s comment."
4081,THE JANEITES,
4082,THE JANEITES,“That’s right! Ours was _Imshee kelb_.[3] Not so ’ard to remember as
4083,THE JANEITES,your Jane stuff.”
4084,THE JANEITES,
4085,THE JANEITES,"“Jane wasn’t so very ’ard--not the way Macklin used to put ’er,”"
4086,THE JANEITES,Humberstall resumed. “I ’ad only six books to remember. I learned
4087,THE JANEITES,"the names by ’eart as Macklin placed ’em. There was one, called"
4088,THE JANEITES,"_Persuasion_, first; an’ the rest in a bunch, except another about some"
4089,THE JANEITES,"Abbey or other--last by three lengths. But, as I was sayin’, what beat"
4090,THE JANEITES,"me was there was nothin’ _to_ ’em nor _in_ ’em. Nothin’ at all, believe"
4091,THE JANEITES,me.”
4092,THE JANEITES,
4093,THE JANEITES,"“You seem good an’ full of ’em, any’ow,” said Anthony."
4094,THE JANEITES,
4095,THE JANEITES,“I mean that ’er characters was no _use_! They was only just like
4096,THE JANEITES,people you run across any day. One of ’em was a curate--the Reverend
4097,THE JANEITES,"Collins--always on the make an’ lookin’ to marry money. Well, when I"
4098,THE JANEITES,"was a Boy Scout, ’im or ’is twin brother was our troop-leader. An’"
4099,THE JANEITES,there was an upstandin’ ’ard-mouthed Duchess or a Baronet’s wife that
4100,THE JANEITES,didn’t give a curse for any one ’oo wouldn’t do what she told ’em to;
4101,THE JANEITES,the Lady--Lady Catherine (I’ll get it in a minute) De Bugg. Before
4102,THE JANEITES,Ma bought the ’airdressin’ business in London I used to know of an
4103,THE JANEITES,’olesale grocer’s wife near Leicester (I’m Leicestershire myself) that
4104,THE JANEITES,might ’ave been ’er duplicate. And--oh yes--there was a Miss Bates;
4105,THE JANEITES,"just an old maid runnin’ about like a hen with ’er ’ead cut off, an’"
4106,THE JANEITES,her tongue loose at both ends. I’ve got an aunt like ’er. Good as
4107,THE JANEITES,"gold--but, _you_ know.”"
4108,THE JANEITES,
4109,THE JANEITES,"“Lord, yes!” said Anthony, with feeling. “An’ did you find out what"
4110,THE JANEITES,_Tilniz_ meant? I’m always huntin’ after the meanin’ of things meself.”
4111,THE JANEITES,
4112,THE JANEITES,"“Yes, ’e was a swine of a Major-General, retired, and on the make."
4113,THE JANEITES,"They’re all on the make, in a quiet way, in Jane. ’E was so much of"
4114,THE JANEITES,a gentleman by ’is own estimation that ’e was always be’avin’ like a
4115,THE JANEITES,hound. _You_ know the sort. ’Turned a girl out of ’is own ’ouse because
4116,THE JANEITES,"she ’adn’t any money--_after_, mark you, encouragin’ ’er to set ’er"
4117,THE JANEITES,"cap at his son, because ’e thought she had.”"
4118,THE JANEITES,
4119,THE JANEITES,"“But that ’appens all the time,” said Anthony. “Why, me own mother----”"
4120,THE JANEITES,
4121,THE JANEITES,"“That’s right. So would mine. But this Tilney was a man, an’ some’ow"
4122,THE JANEITES,"Jane put it down all so naked it made you ashamed. I told Macklin that,"
4123,THE JANEITES,an’ he said I was shapin’ to be a good Janeite. ’Twasn’t _his_ fault if
4124,THE JANEITES,"I wasn’t. ’Nother thing, too; ’avin’ been at the Bath Mineral Waters"
4125,THE JANEITES,"’Ospital in ’Sixteen, with trench-feet, was a great advantage to me,"
4126,THE JANEITES,because I knew the names o’ the streets where Jane ’ad lived. There was
4127,THE JANEITES,"one of ’em--Laura, I think, or some other girl’s name--which Macklin"
4128,THE JANEITES,"said was ’oly ground. ‘If you’d been initiated _then_,’ he says, ‘you’d"
4129,THE JANEITES,ha’ felt your flat feet tingle every time you walked over those sacred
4130,THE JANEITES,pavin’-stones.’
4131,THE JANEITES,
4132,THE JANEITES,"“‘My feet tingled right enough,’ I said, ‘but not on account of Jane."
4133,THE JANEITES,"Nothin’ remarkable about that,’ I says."
4134,THE JANEITES,
4135,THE JANEITES,"“‘’Eaven lend me patience!’ he says, combin’ ’is ’air with ’is little"
4136,THE JANEITES,hands. ‘Every dam’ thing about Jane is remarkable to a pukka Janeite!
4137,THE JANEITES,"It was there,’ he says, ‘that Miss What’s-her-Name’ (he had the name;"
4138,THE JANEITES,"I’ve forgotten it), ‘made up ’er engagement again, after nine years,"
4139,THE JANEITES,with Captain T’other Bloke.’ An’ he dished me out a page an’ a half of
4140,THE JANEITES,"one of the books to learn by ’eart--_Persuasion_, I think it was.”"
4141,THE JANEITES,
4142,THE JANEITES,“’You quick at gettin’ things off by ’eart?” Anthony demanded.
4143,THE JANEITES,
4144,THE JANEITES,"“Not as a rule. I was then, though, or else Macklin knew ’ow to deliver"
4145,THE JANEITES,"the Charges properly. ’E said ’e’d been some sort o’ schoolmaster once,"
4146,THE JANEITES,and he’d make my mind resume work or break ’imself. That was just
4147,THE JANEITES,before the Battery Sergeant Major ’ad it in for him on account o’ what
4148,THE JANEITES,he’d been sayin’ about the Chinese wife an’ the dolly-shop.”
4149,THE JANEITES,
4150,THE JANEITES,“What did Macklin really say?” Anthony and I asked together.
4151,THE JANEITES,Humberstall gave us a fragment. It was hardly the stuff to let loose on
4152,THE JANEITES,a pious post-war world without revision.
4153,THE JANEITES,
4154,THE JANEITES,“And what had your B. S. M. been in civil life?” I asked at the end.
4155,THE JANEITES,
4156,THE JANEITES,"“’Ead-embalmer to an ’olesale undertaker in the Midlands,” said"
4157,THE JANEITES,"Humberstall; “but, o’ course, _when_ he thought ’e saw his chance he"
4158,THE JANEITES,naturally took it. He came along one mornin’ lickin’ ’is lips. ‘You
4159,THE JANEITES,"don’t get past me this time,’ ’e says to Macklin. ‘You’re for it,"
4160,THE JANEITES,Professor.’
4161,THE JANEITES,
4162,THE JANEITES,"“‘’Ow so, me gallant Major,’ says Macklin; ’an’ what for?’"
4163,THE JANEITES,
4164,THE JANEITES,"“‘For writin’ obese words on the breech o’ the ten-inch,’ says the"
4165,THE JANEITES,B. S. M. She was our old Skoda that I’ve been tellin’ you about. We
4166,THE JANEITES,called ’er ‘Bloody Eliza.’ She ’ad a badly wore obturator an’ blew
4167,THE JANEITES,through a fair treat. I knew by Macklin’s face the B. S. M. ’ad dropped
4168,THE JANEITES,"it somewhere, but all he vow’saifed was, ‘Very good, Major. We will"
4169,THE JANEITES,consider it in Common Room.’ The B. S. M. couldn’t ever stand Macklin’s
4170,THE JANEITES,toff’s way o’ puttin’ things; so he goes off rumblin’ like ’ell’s bells
4171,THE JANEITES,"in an ’urricane, as the Marines say. Macklin put it to me at once, what"
4172,THE JANEITES,had I been doin’? Some’ow he could read me like a book.
4173,THE JANEITES,
4174,THE JANEITES,"“Well, all _I_’d done--an’ I told ’im _he_ was responsible for it--was"
4175,THE JANEITES,to chalk the guns. ’Ammick never minded what the men wrote up on ’em.
4176,THE JANEITES,’E said it gave ’em an interest in their job. You’d see all sorts of
4177,THE JANEITES,remarks chalked on the side-plates or the gear-casin’s.”
4178,THE JANEITES,
4179,THE JANEITES,"“What sort of remarks?” said Anthony, keenly."
4180,THE JANEITES,
4181,THE JANEITES,"“Oh! ’Ow Bloody Eliza, or Spittin’ Jim--that was our old Mark Five"
4182,THE JANEITES,"Nine-point-two--felt that morning, an’ such things. But it ’ad come"
4183,THE JANEITES,over me--more to please Macklin than anythin’ else--that it was time
4184,THE JANEITES,"we Janeites ’ad a look in. So, as I was tellin’ you, I’d taken an’"
4185,THE JANEITES,"rechristened all three of ’em, on my own, early that mornin’. Spittin’"
4186,THE JANEITES,Jim I ’ad chalked ‘The Reverend Collins’--that Curate I was tellin’
4187,THE JANEITES,"you about; an’ our cut-down Navy Twelve, ‘General Tilney,’ because"
4188,THE JANEITES,it was worse wore in the groovin’ than anything _I_’d ever seen. The
4189,THE JANEITES,Skoda (an’ that was where _I_ dropped it) I ’ad chalked up ‘The Lady
4190,THE JANEITES,Catherine De Bugg.’ I made a clean breast of it all to Macklin. He
4191,THE JANEITES,"reached up an’ patted me on the shoulder. ‘You done nobly,’ he says."
4192,THE JANEITES,"‘You’re bringin’ forth abundant fruit, like a good Janeite. But I’m"
4193,THE JANEITES,afraid your spellin’ has misled our worthy B. S. M. _That’s_ what it
4194,THE JANEITES,"is,’ ’e says, slappin’ ’is little leg. ‘’Ow might you ’ave spelt De"
4195,THE JANEITES,"Burgh, for example?’"
4196,THE JANEITES,
4197,THE JANEITES,“I told ’im. ’Twasn’t right; an’ ’e nips off to the Skoda to make it
4198,THE JANEITES,"so. When ’e comes back, ’e says that the Gander ’ad been before ’im"
4199,THE JANEITES,"an’ corrected the error. But we two come up before the Major, just the"
4200,THE JANEITES,"same, that afternoon after lunch; ’Ammick in the chair, so to speak,"
4201,THE JANEITES,"Mosse in another, an’ the B. S. M. chargin’ Macklin with writin’ obese"
4202,THE JANEITES,"words on His Majesty’s property, on active service. When it transpired"
4203,THE JANEITES,"that me an’ not Macklin was the offendin’ party, the B. S. M. turned"
4204,THE JANEITES,’is hand in and sulked like a baby. ’E as good as told ’Ammick ’e
4205,THE JANEITES,"couldn’t hope to preserve discipline unless examples was made--meanin’,"
4206,THE JANEITES,"o’ course, Macklin.”"
4207,THE JANEITES,
4208,THE JANEITES,"“Yes, I’ve heard all that,” said Anthony with a contemptuous grunt."
4209,THE JANEITES,"“The worst of it is, a lot of it’s true.”"
4210,THE JANEITES,
4211,THE JANEITES,"“’Ammick took ’im up sharp about Military Law, which he said was even"
4212,THE JANEITES,more fair than the civilian article.”
4213,THE JANEITES,
4214,THE JANEITES,“My Gawd!” This came from Anthony’s scornful mid-most bosom.
4215,THE JANEITES,
4216,THE JANEITES,"“’Accordin’ to the unwritten law of the ’Eavies,’ says ’Ammick,"
4217,THE JANEITES,"‘there’s no objection to the men chalkin’ the guns, if decency is"
4218,THE JANEITES,"preserved. On the other ’and,’ says he, ‘we ’aven’t yet settled the"
4219,THE JANEITES,precise status of individuals entitled so to do. I ’old that the
4220,THE JANEITES,privilege is confined to combatants only.’
4221,THE JANEITES,
4222,THE JANEITES,"“‘With the permission of the Court,’ says Mosse, who was another"
4223,THE JANEITES,"born lawyer, ‘I’d like to be allowed to join issue on that point."
4224,THE JANEITES,"Prisoner’s position is very delicate an’ doubtful, an’ he has no legal"
4225,THE JANEITES,representative.’
4226,THE JANEITES,
4227,THE JANEITES,"“‘Very good,’ says ’Ammick. ‘Macklin bein’ acquitted----’"
4228,THE JANEITES,
4229,THE JANEITES,"“‘With submission, me lud,’ says Mosse. ‘I hope to prove ’e was"
4230,THE JANEITES,accessory before the fact.’
4231,THE JANEITES,
4232,THE JANEITES,"“‘_As_ you please,’ says ’Ammick. ‘But in that case, ’oo the ’ell’s"
4233,THE JANEITES,goin’ to get the port I’m tryin’ to stand the Court?’
4234,THE JANEITES,
4235,THE JANEITES,"“‘I submit,’ says Mosse, ‘prisoner, bein’ under direct observation o’"
4236,THE JANEITES,"the Court, could be temporarily enlarged for that duty.’"
4237,THE JANEITES,
4238,THE JANEITES,"“So Macklin went an’ got it, an’ the B. S. M. had ’is glass with the"
4239,THE JANEITES,rest. Then they argued whether mess servants an’ non-combatants was
4240,THE JANEITES,"entitled to chalk the guns (’Ammick _versus_ Mosse). After a bit,"
4241,THE JANEITES,"’Ammick as C. O. give ’imself best, an’ me an’ Macklin was severely"
4242,THE JANEITES,"admonished for trespassin’ on combatants’ rights, an’ the B. S. M. was"
4243,THE JANEITES,warned that if we repeated the offence ’e could deal with us summ’rily.
4244,THE JANEITES,He ’ad some glasses o’ port an’ went out quite ’appy. Then my turn
4245,THE JANEITES,"come, while Macklin was gettin’ them their tea; an’ one thing leadin’"
4246,THE JANEITES,"to another, ’Ammick put me through all the Janeite Degrees, you might"
4247,THE JANEITES,say. ’Never ’ad such a doin’ in my life.”
4248,THE JANEITES,
4249,THE JANEITES,"“Yes, but what did you tell ’em?” said Anthony. “I can’t ever _think_"
4250,THE JANEITES,my lies quick enough when I’m for it.”
4251,THE JANEITES,
4252,THE JANEITES,"“No need to lie. I told ’em that the back-side view o’ the Skoda, when"
4253,THE JANEITES,"she was run up, put Lady De Bugg into my ’ead. They gave me right"
4254,THE JANEITES,"there, but they said I was wrong about General Tilney. ’Cordin’ to"
4255,THE JANEITES,"them, our Navy twelve-inch ought to ’ave been christened Miss Bates."
4256,THE JANEITES,"I said the same idea ’ad crossed my mind, till I’d seen the General’s"
4257,THE JANEITES,groovin’. Then I felt it had to be the General or nothin’. But they
4258,THE JANEITES,give me full marks for the Reverend Collins--our Nine-point-two.”
4259,THE JANEITES,
4260,THE JANEITES,“An’ you fed ’em _that_ sort o’ talk?” Anthony’s fox-coloured eyebrows
4261,THE JANEITES,climbed almost into his hair.
4262,THE JANEITES,
4263,THE JANEITES,“While I was assistin’ Macklin to get tea--yes. Seein’ it was an
4264,THE JANEITES,"examination, I wanted to do ’im credit as a Janeite.”"
4265,THE JANEITES,
4266,THE JANEITES,“An’--an’ what did they say?”
4267,THE JANEITES,
4268,THE JANEITES,"“They said it was ’ighly creditable to us both. I don’t drink, so they"
4269,THE JANEITES,give me about a hundred fags.”
4270,THE JANEITES,
4271,THE JANEITES,"“Gawd! What a Circus you must ’ave been,” was Anthony’s gasping comment."
4272,THE JANEITES,
4273,THE JANEITES,“It _was_ a ’appy little Group. I wouldn’t ’a changed with any other.”
4274,THE JANEITES,
4275,THE JANEITES,Humberstall sighed heavily as he helped Anthony slide back the
4276,THE JANEITES,"organ-panel. We all admired it in silence, while Anthony repocketed"
4277,THE JANEITES,"his secret polishing mixture, which lived in a tin tobacco-box. I"
4278,THE JANEITES,had neglected my work for listening to Humberstall. Anthony reached
4279,THE JANEITES,out quietly and took over a Secretary’s Jewel and a rag. Humberstall
4280,THE JANEITES,studied his reflection in the glossy wood.
4281,THE JANEITES,
4282,THE JANEITES,"“Almost,” he said critically, holding his head to one side."
4283,THE JANEITES,
4284,THE JANEITES,"“Not with an Army. You could with a Safety, though,” said Anthony. And,"
4285,THE JANEITES,"indeed, as Brother Burges had foretold, one might have shaved in it"
4286,THE JANEITES,with comfort.
4287,THE JANEITES,
4288,THE JANEITES,"“Did you ever run across any of ’em afterwards, any time?” Anthony"
4289,THE JANEITES,asked presently.
4290,THE JANEITES,
4291,THE JANEITES,"“Not so many of ’em left to run after, now. With the ’Eavies it’s"
4292,THE JANEITES,mostly neck or nothin’. We copped it. In the neck. In due time.”
4293,THE JANEITES,
4294,THE JANEITES,"“Well, _you_ come out of it all right.” Anthony spoke both stoutly and"
4295,THE JANEITES,soothingly; but Humberstall would not be comforted.
4296,THE JANEITES,
4297,THE JANEITES,"“That’s right; but I almost wish I ’adn’t,” he sighed. “I was ’appier"
4298,THE JANEITES,there than ever before or since. Jerry’s March push in ’Eighteen did
4299,THE JANEITES,"us in; an’ yet, ’ow could we ’ave expected it? ’Ow _could_ we ’ave"
4300,THE JANEITES,"expected it? We’d been sent back for rest an’ runnin’-repairs, back"
4301,THE JANEITES,pretty near our base; an’ our old loco’ that used to shift us about
4302,THE JANEITES,"o’ nights, she’d gone down the line for repairs. But for ’Ammick we"
4303,THE JANEITES,wouldn’t even ’ave ’ad our camouflage-screens up. He told our Brigadier
4304,THE JANEITES,"that, whatever ’e might be in the Gunnery line, as a leadin’ Divorce"
4305,THE JANEITES,lawyer he never threw away a point in argument. So ’e ’ad us all
4306,THE JANEITES,screened in over in a cuttin’ on a little spur-line near a wood; an’
4307,THE JANEITES,’e saw to the screens ’imself. The leaves weren’t more than comin’ out
4308,THE JANEITES,"then, an’ the sun used to make our glue-paint stink. Just like actin’"
4309,THE JANEITES,"in a theatre, it was! But ’appy. _But_ ’appy! I expect if we’d been"
4310,THE JANEITES,"caterpillars, like the new big six-inch hows, they’d ha’ remembered us."
4311,THE JANEITES,But we was the old La Bassee ’15 Mark o’ Heavies that ran on rails--not
4312,THE JANEITES,"much more good than scrap-iron that late in the war. An’, believe me,"
4313,THE JANEITES,"gents--or Brethren, as I should say--we copped it cruel. Look ’ere!"
4314,THE JANEITES,"It was in the afternoon, an’ I was watchin’ Gander instructin’ a class"
4315,THE JANEITES,in new sights at Lady Catherine. All of a sudden I ’eard our screens
4316,THE JANEITES,"rip overhead, an’ a runner on a motor-bike come sailin’, sailin’"
4317,THE JANEITES,through the air--like that bloke that used to bicycle off Brighton
4318,THE JANEITES,"Pier--and landed one awful wop almost atop o’ the class. ‘’Old ’ard,’"
4319,THE JANEITES,says Gander. ‘That’s no way to report. What’s the fuss?’ ‘Your screens
4320,THE JANEITES,"’ave broke my back, for one thing,’ says the bloke on the ground;"
4321,THE JANEITES,"‘an’ for another, the ’ole front’s gone.’ ‘Nonsense,’ says Gander. ’E"
4322,THE JANEITES,’adn’t more than passed the remark when the man was vi’lently sick an’
4323,THE JANEITES,conked out. ’E ’ad plenty papers on ’im from Brigadiers and C. O.’s
4324,THE JANEITES,reporting ’emselves cut off an’ askin’ for orders. ’E was right both
4325,THE JANEITES,ways--his back an’ our front. The ’ole Somme front washed out as clean
4326,THE JANEITES,as kiss-me-’and!” His huge hand smashed down open on his knee.
4327,THE JANEITES,
4328,THE JANEITES,“We ’eard about it at the time in the ’Oly Land. Was it reelly as quick
4329,THE JANEITES,as all that?” said Anthony.
4330,THE JANEITES,
4331,THE JANEITES,“Quicker! Look ’ere! The motor-bike dropped in on us about four
4332,THE JANEITES,"pip-emma. After that, we tried to get orders o’ some kind or other, but"
4333,THE JANEITES,nothin’ came through excep’ that all available transport was in use
4334,THE JANEITES,and not likely to be released. _That_ didn’t ’elp us any. About nine
4335,THE JANEITES,o’clock comes along a young Brass ’At in brown gloves. We was quite a
4336,THE JANEITES,surprise to ’im. ’E said they were evacuating the area and we’d better
4337,THE JANEITES,"shift. ‘Where to?’ says ’Ammick, rather short."
4338,THE JANEITES,
4339,THE JANEITES,"“‘Oh, somewhere Amiens way,’ he says. ‘Not that I’d guarantee Amiens"
4340,THE JANEITES,for any length o’ time; but Amiens might do to begin with.’ I’m giving
4341,THE JANEITES,"you the very words. Then ’e goes off swingin’ ’is brown gloves, and"
4342,THE JANEITES,’Ammick sends for Gander and orders ’im to march the men through Amiens
4343,THE JANEITES,"to Dieppe; book thence to New’aven, take up positions be’ind Seaford,"
4344,THE JANEITES,an’ carry on the war. Gander said ’e’d see ’im damned first. ’Ammick
4345,THE JANEITES,says ’e’d see ’im court-martialled after. Gander says what ’e meant
4346,THE JANEITES,to say was that the men ’ud see all an’ sundry damned before they
4347,THE JANEITES,went into Amiens with their gun-sights wrapped up in their putties.
4348,THE JANEITES,"’Ammick says ’e ’adn’t said a word about putties, an’ carryin’ off the"
4349,THE JANEITES,"gun-sights was purely optional. ‘Well, anyhow,’ says Gander, ’putties"
4350,THE JANEITES,"_or_ drawers, they ain’t goin’ to shift a step unless you lead the"
4351,THE JANEITES,procession.’
4352,THE JANEITES,
4353,THE JANEITES,"“‘Mutinous ’ounds,’ says ’Ammick. ‘But we live in a democratic age."
4354,THE JANEITES,D’you suppose they’d object to kindly diggin’ ’emselves in a bit?’ ‘Not
4355,THE JANEITES,"at all,’ says Gander. ‘The B. S. M.’s kept ’em at it like terriers for"
4356,THE JANEITES,"the last three hours.’ ‘That bein’ so,’ says ’Ammick, ‘Macklin’ll now"
4357,THE JANEITES,fetch us small glasses o’ port.’ Then Mosse comes in--he could smell
4358,THE JANEITES,port a mile off--an’ he submits we’d only add to the congestion in
4359,THE JANEITES,"Amiens if we took our crowd there, whereas, if we lay doggo where we"
4360,THE JANEITES,"was, Jerry might miss us, though he didn’t seem to be missin’ much that"
4361,THE JANEITES,evenin’.
4362,THE JANEITES,
4363,THE JANEITES,"“The ’ole country was pretty noisy, an’ our dumps we’d lit ourselves"
4364,THE JANEITES,flarin’ Heavens high as far as you could see. Lyin’ doggo was our best
4365,THE JANEITES,"chance. I believe we might ha’ pulled it off, if we’d been left alone,"
4366,THE JANEITES,"but along towards midnight--there was some small stuff swishin’ about,"
4367,THE JANEITES,but nothin’ particular--a nice little baldheaded old gentleman in
4368,THE JANEITES,uniform pushes into the dug-out wipin’ his glasses an’ sayin’ ’e was
4369,THE JANEITES,thinkin’ o’ formin’ a defensive flank on our left with ’is battalion
4370,THE JANEITES,which ’ad just come up. ’Ammick says ’e wouldn’t form much if ’e was
4371,THE JANEITES,"’im. ‘Oh, don’t say _that_,’ says the old gentleman, very shocked. ‘One"
4372,THE JANEITES,"must support the Guns, mustn’t one?’ ’Ammick says we was refittin’ an’"
4373,THE JANEITES,"about as effective, just then, as a public lav’tory. ‘Go into Amiens,’"
4374,THE JANEITES,"he says, ‘an’ defend ’em there.’ ‘Oh no,’ says the old gentleman, ‘me"
4375,THE JANEITES,"an’ my laddies _must_ make a defensive flank for you,’ an’ he flips"
4376,THE JANEITES,"out of the dug-out like a performin’ bull-finch, chirruppin’ for his"
4377,THE JANEITES,‘laddies.’ Gawd in ’Eaven knows what sort o’ push they was--little
4378,THE JANEITES,boys mostly--but they ’ung on to ’is coat-tails like a Sunday-school
4379,THE JANEITES,"treat, an’ we ’eard ’em muckin’ about in the open for a bit. Then a"
4380,THE JANEITES,"pretty tight barrage was slapped down for ten minutes, an’ ’Ammick"
4381,THE JANEITES,"thought the laddies had copped it already. ‘It’ll be our turn next,’"
4382,THE JANEITES,says Mosse. ‘There’s been a covey o’ Gothas messin’ about for the
4383,THE JANEITES,last ’alf-hour--lookin’ for the Railway Shops I expect. They’re just
4384,THE JANEITES,"as likely to take us.’ ‘Arisin’ out o’ that,’ says ’Ammick, ‘one of"
4385,THE JANEITES,"’em sounds pretty low down now. We’re for it, me learned colleagues!’"
4386,THE JANEITES,"‘Jesus!’ says Gander, ‘I believe you’re right, sir.’ And that was the"
4387,THE JANEITES,last word _I_ ’eard on the matter.”
4388,THE JANEITES,
4389,THE JANEITES,“Did they cop you then?” said Anthony.
4390,THE JANEITES,
4391,THE JANEITES,"“They did. I expect Mosse was right, an’ they took us for the Railway"
4392,THE JANEITES,"Shops. When I come to, I was lyin’ outside the cuttin’, which was"
4393,THE JANEITES,pretty well filled up. The Reverend Collins was all right; but Lady
4394,THE JANEITES,"Catherine and the General was past prayin’ for. I lay there, takin’"
4395,THE JANEITES,"it in, till I felt cold an’ I looked at meself. Otherwise, I ’adn’t"
4396,THE JANEITES,much on excep’ me boots. So I got up an’ walked about to keep warm.
4397,THE JANEITES,Then I saw somethin’ like a mushroom in the moonlight. It was the
4398,THE JANEITES,nice old gentleman’s bald ’ead. I patted it. ’Im and ’is laddies ’ad
4399,THE JANEITES,"copped it right enough. Some battalion run out in a ’urry from England,"
4400,THE JANEITES,I suppose. They ’adn’t even begun to dig in--pore little perishers!
4401,THE JANEITES,"I dressed myself off ’em there, an’ topped off with a British warm."
4402,THE JANEITES,"Then I went back to the cuttin’ an’ some one says to me: ‘Dig, you ox,"
4403,THE JANEITES,dig! Gander’s under.’ So I ’elped shift things till I threw up blood
4404,THE JANEITES,"an’ bile mixed. Then I dropped, an’ they brought Gander out--dead--an’"
4405,THE JANEITES,"laid ’im next me. ’Ammick ’ad gone too--fair tore in ’alf, the B. S. M."
4406,THE JANEITES,"said; but the funny thing was he talked quite a lot before ’e died, an’"
4407,THE JANEITES,"nothin’ to ’im below ’is stummick, they told me. Mosse we never found."
4408,THE JANEITES,’E’d been standing by Lady Catherine. She’d up-ended an’ gone back on
4409,THE JANEITES,"’em, with ’alf the cuttin’ atop of ’er, by the look of things.”"
4410,THE JANEITES,
4411,THE JANEITES,“And what come to Macklin?” said Anthony.
4412,THE JANEITES,
4413,THE JANEITES,“Dunno.... ’E was with ’Ammick. I expect I must ha’ been blown clear of
4414,THE JANEITES,all by the first bomb; for I was the on’y Janeite left. We lost about
4415,THE JANEITES,"half our crowd either under, or after we’d got ’em out. The B. S. M."
4416,THE JANEITES,"went off ’is rocker when mornin’ came, an’ he ran about from one to"
4417,THE JANEITES,another sayin’: ‘That was a good push! That was a great crowd! Did ye
4418,THE JANEITES,ever know any push to touch ’em?’ An’ then ’e’d cry. So what was left
4419,THE JANEITES,"of us made off for ourselves, an’ I came across a lorry, pretty full,"
4420,THE JANEITES,but they took me in.”
4421,THE JANEITES,
4422,THE JANEITES,“Ah!” said Anthony with pride. “They all take a taxi when it’s rainin’.
4423,THE JANEITES,’Ever ’eard that song?”
4424,THE JANEITES,
4425,THE JANEITES,"“They went a long way back. Then I walked a bit, an’ there was a"
4426,THE JANEITES,"hospital-train fillin’ up, an’ one of the Sisters--a grey-headed"
4427,THE JANEITES,one--ran at me wavin’ ’er red ’ands an’ sayin’ there wasn’t room for
4428,THE JANEITES,a louse in it. I was past carin’. But she went on talkin’ and talkin’
4429,THE JANEITES,"about the war, an’ her pa in Ladbroke Grove, an’ ’ow strange for ’er"
4430,THE JANEITES,"at ’er time of life to be doin’ this work with a lot o’ men, an’ next"
4431,THE JANEITES,"war, ’ow the nurses ’ud ’ave to wear khaki breeches on account o’ the"
4432,THE JANEITES,"mud, like the Land Girls; an’ that reminded ’er, she’d boil me an egg"
4433,THE JANEITES,"if she could lay ’ands on one, for she’d run a chicken-farm once. You"
4434,THE JANEITES,never ’eard anythin’ like it--outside o’ Jane. It set me off laughin’
4435,THE JANEITES,"again. Then a woman with a nose an’ teeth on ’er, marched up. ‘What’s"
4436,THE JANEITES,"all this?’ she says. ‘What do you want?’ ‘Nothing,’ I says, ‘only make"
4437,THE JANEITES,"Miss Bates, there, stop talkin’ or I’ll die.’ ‘Miss Bates?’ she says."
4438,THE JANEITES,"‘What in ’Eaven’s name makes you call ’er that?’ ‘Because she is,’ I"
4439,THE JANEITES,"says. ‘D’you know what you’re sayin’?’ she says, an’ slings her bony"
4440,THE JANEITES,"arm round me to get me off the ground. ‘’Course I do,’ I says, ‘an’"
4441,THE JANEITES,"if you knew Jane you’d know too.’ ‘That’s enough,’ says she. ‘You’re"
4442,THE JANEITES,"comin’ on this train if I have to kill a Brigadier for you,’ an’ she"
4443,THE JANEITES,"an’ an ord’ly fair hove me into the train, on to a stretcher close to"
4444,THE JANEITES,the cookers. That beef-tea went down well! Then she shook ’ands with me
4445,THE JANEITES,"an’ said I’d hit off Sister Molyneux in one, an’ then she pinched me an"
4446,THE JANEITES,extra blanket. It was ’er own ’ospital pretty much. I expect she was
4447,THE JANEITES,"the Lady Catherine de Burgh of the area. Well, an’ so, to cut a long"
4448,THE JANEITES,"story short, nothing further transpired.”"
4449,THE JANEITES,
4450,THE JANEITES,“’Adn’t you ’ad enough by then?” asked Anthony.
4451,THE JANEITES,
4452,THE JANEITES,"“I expect so. Otherwise, if the old Circus ’ad been carryin’ on, I"
4453,THE JANEITES,might ’ave ’ad another turn with ’em before Armistice. Our B. S. M. was
4454,THE JANEITES,right. There never was a ’appier push. ’Ammick an’ Mosse an’ Gander an’
4455,THE JANEITES,the B. S. M. an’ that pore little Macklin-man makin’ an’ passin’ an’
4456,THE JANEITES,"raisin’ me an’ gettin’ me on to the ’ospital train after ’e was dead,"
4457,THE JANEITES,"all for a couple of Bradburys. I lie awake nights still, reviewing"
4458,THE JANEITES,matters. There never was a push to touch ours--never!”
4459,THE JANEITES,
4460,THE JANEITES,Anthony handed me back the Secretary’s Jewel resplendent.
4461,THE JANEITES,
4462,THE JANEITES,"“Ah,” said he. “No denyin’ that Jane business was more useful to you"
4463,THE JANEITES,than the Roman Eagles or the Star an’ Garter. ’Pity there wasn’t any of
4464,THE JANEITES,you Janeites in the ’Oly Land. _I_ never come across ’em.”
4465,THE JANEITES,
4466,THE JANEITES,"“Well, as pore Macklin said, it’s a very select Society, an’ you’ve"
4467,THE JANEITES,"got to be a Janeite in your ’eart, or you won’t have any success. An’"
4468,THE JANEITES,yet he made _me_ a Janeite! I read all her six books now for pleasure
4469,THE JANEITES,’tween times in the shop; an’ it brings it all back--down to the smell
4470,THE JANEITES,"of the glue-paint on the screens. You take it from me, Brethren,"
4471,THE JANEITES,there’s no one to touch Jane when you’re in a tight place. Gawd bless
4472,THE JANEITES,"’er, whoever she was.”"
4473,THE JANEITES,
4474,THE JANEITES,"Worshipful Brother Burges, from the floor of the Lodge, called us all"
4475,THE JANEITES,from Labour to Refreshment. Humberstall hove himself up--so very a
4476,THE JANEITES,cart-horse of a man one almost expected to hear the harness creak on
4477,THE JANEITES,his back--and descended the steps.
4478,THE JANEITES,
4479,THE JANEITES,He said he could not stay for tea because he had promised his mother to
4480,THE JANEITES,"come home for it, and she would most probably be waiting for him now at"
4481,THE JANEITES,the Lodge door.
4482,THE JANEITES,
4483,THE JANEITES,“One or other of ’em always comes for ’im. He’s apt to miss ’is gears
4484,THE JANEITES,"sometimes,” Anthony explained to me, as we followed."
4485,THE JANEITES,
4486,THE JANEITES,"“Goes on a bust, d’you mean?”"
4487,THE JANEITES,
4488,THE JANEITES,“’Im! He’s no more touched liquor than ’e ’as women since ’e was born.
4489,THE JANEITES,"No, ’e’s liable to a sort o’ quiet fits, like. They came on after the"
4490,THE JANEITES,"dump blew up at Eatables. But for them, ’e’d ha’ been Battery Sergeant"
4491,THE JANEITES,Major.”
4492,THE JANEITES,
4493,THE JANEITES,“Oh!” I said. “I couldn’t make out why he took on as mess-waiter when
4494,THE JANEITES,he got back to his guns. That explains things a bit.”
4495,THE JANEITES,
4496,THE JANEITES,“’Is sister told me the dump goin’ up knocked all ’is Gunnery
4497,THE JANEITES,instruction clean out of ’im. The only thing ’e stuck to was to get
4498,THE JANEITES,"back to ’is old crowd. Gawd knows ’ow ’e worked it, but ’e did. He fair"
4499,THE JANEITES,"deserted out of England to ’em, she says; an’ when they saw the state"
4500,THE JANEITES,"’e was in, they ’adn’t the ’eart to send ’im back or into ’ospital."
4501,THE JANEITES,"They kep’ ’im for a mascot, as you might say. That’s _all_ dead true."
4502,THE JANEITES,"’Is sister told me so. But I can’t guarantee that Janeite business,"
4503,THE JANEITES,excep’ ’e never told a lie since ’e was six. ’Is sister told me so.
4504,THE JANEITES,What do _you_ think?”
4505,THE JANEITES,
4506,THE JANEITES,"“He isn’t likely to have made it up out of his own head,” I replied."
4507,THE JANEITES,
4508,THE JANEITES,"“But people don’t get so crazy-fond o’ books as all that, do they? ’E’s"
4509,THE JANEITES,"made ’is sister try to read ’em. She’d do anythin’ to please him. But,"
4510,THE JANEITES,"as I keep tellin’ ’er, so’d ’is mother. D’you ’appen to know anything"
4511,THE JANEITES,about Jane?”
4512,THE JANEITES,
4513,THE JANEITES,“I believe Jane was a bit of a match-maker in a quiet way when she was
4514,THE JANEITES,"alive, and I know all her books are full of match-making,” I said."
4515,THE JANEITES,“_You’d_ better look out.”
4516,THE JANEITES,
4517,THE JANEITES,"“Oh, _that’s_ as good as settled,” Anthony replied, blushing."
4518,THE JANEITES,

4626,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,with unherded beeves carrying red numbered tickets on their rumps. An
4627,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"English-speaking policeman inspected my licence on a bridge, while the"

4645,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"steel--to fracture; and by the time we had found the trouble, night"
4646,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,shut down on us. A rounded pile of woods ahead took one sudden star
4647,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,to its forehead and faded out; the way-waste melted into the darker
4648,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,velvet of the hedge; another star reflected itself in the glassy black
4649,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,of the bitumened road; and a weak moon struggled up out of a mist-patch
4650,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"from a valley. Our lights painted the grass unearthly greens, and the"
4651,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"tree-boles bone-white. A church clock struck eleven, as I curled up"
4652,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"in the front seat and awaited the progress of Time and Things, with"
4653,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,some notion of picking up a tow towards morning. It was long since I
4654,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"had spent a night in the open, and the hour worked on me. Time was"
4655,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"when such nights, and the winds that heralded their dawns, had been"
4656,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"fortunate and blessed; but those Gates, I thought, were for ever"
4657,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,shut....
4658,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4659,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"I diagnosed it as a baker’s van on a Ford chassis, lit with unusual"
4660,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,extravagance. It pulled up and asked what the trouble might be. The
4661,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"first sentence sufficed, even had my lights not revealed the full"
4662,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"hairless face, the horn-rimmed spectacles, the hooded boots below,"
4663,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"and the soft hat, fashioned on no block known to the Eastern trade,"
4664,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"above, the yellow raincoat. I explained the situation. The resources"
4665,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,of Mr. Henry Ford’s machines did not run to spare parts of my car’s
4666,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"type, but--it was a beautiful night for camping-out. He himself was"
4667,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,independent of hotels. His outfit was a caravan hired these months
4668,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,past for tours of Great Britain. He had been alone since his wife
4669,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"died, of duodenal ulcer, five years ago. Comparative Ethnology was his"
4670,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"present study. No, not a professor, nor, indeed, ever at any College,"
4671,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,but a “realtor”--a dealer in real estate in a suburb of the great
4672,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"and cultured centre of Omaha, Nebraska. Had I ever heard of it? I"
4673,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,had once visited the very place and there had met an unforgettable
4674,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,funeral-furnisher; but I found myself (under influence of the night and
4675,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"my Demon) denying all knowledge of the United States. I had, I said,"
4676,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,never left my native land; but the passion of my life had ever been
4677,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,the study of the fortunes and future of the U. S. A.; and to this end
4678,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"I had joined three Societies, each of which regularly sent me all its"
4679,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,publications.
4680,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4681,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"He jerked her on to the grass beside my car, where our mingled lights"
4682,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,slashed across the trunks of a little wood; and I was invited into his
4683,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"pitch-pine-lined caravan, with its overpowering electric installation,"
4684,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"its flap-table, typewriter, drawers and lockers below the bunk. Then he"
4685,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"spoke, every word well-relished between massy dentures; the inky-rimmed"
4686,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,spectacles obscuring the eyes and the face as expressionless as the
4687,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,unrelated voice.
4688,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4689,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"He spoke in capital letters, a few of which I have preserved, on our"
4690,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"National Spirit, which, he had sensed, was Homogeneous and in Ethical"
4691,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Contact throughout--Unconscious but Vitally Existent. That was his
4692,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Estimate of our Racial Complex. It was an Asset, but a Democracy"
4693,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,postulating genuine Ideals should be more multitudinously-minded and
4694,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,diverse in Outlook. I assented to everything in a voice that would have
4695,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,drawn confidences from letter-boxes.
4696,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4697,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"He next touched on the Collective Outlook of Democracy, and thence"
4698,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"glanced at Herd Impulse, and the counterbalancing necessity for"
4699,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Individual Self-Expression. Here he began to search his pockets,"
4700,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,sighing heavily from time to time.
4701,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4702,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“Before my wife died, sir, I was rated a one-hundred-per-cent."
4703,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,American. I am now--but.... Have you ever in Our Literature read a book
4704,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"called _The Man Without a Country_? I’m him!” He still rummaged, but"
4705,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,there was a sawing noise behind the face.
4706,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4707,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“And you may say, first and last, drink did it!” he added. The noise"
4708,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"resumed. Evidently he was laughing, so I laughed too. After all, if a"
4709,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"man must drink, what better lair than a caravan? At his next words I"
4710,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,repented.
4711,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4712,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“On my return back home after her burial, I first received my Primal"
4713,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Urge towards Self-Expression. Till then I had never realised myself....
4714,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Ah!”
4715,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4716,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,He had found it at last in a breast pocket--a lank and knotty cigar.
4717,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4718,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“And what, sir, is your genuine Opinion of Prohibition?” he asked when"
4719,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,the butt had been moistened to his liking.
4720,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4721,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“Oh!--er! It’s a--a gallant adventure!” I babbled, for somehow I had"
4722,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,tuned myself to listen-in to tales of other things. He turned towards
4723,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,me slowly.
4724,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4725,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“The Revelation _qua_ Prohibition that came to me on my return back
4726,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,home from her funeral was _not_ along those lines. This is the Platform
4727,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"_I_ stood on.” I became, thenceforward, one of vast crowds being"
4728,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,addressed from that Platform.
4729,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4730,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“There are Races, sir, which have been secluded since their origin"
4731,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,from the microbes--the necessary and beneficent microbes--of
4732,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Civ’lisation. Once those microbes are introdooced to ’em, those races"
4733,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,re-act precisely in proportion to their previous immunity _or_ Racial
4734,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Virginity. Measles, which I’ve had twice and never laid by for, are"
4735,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"as fatal to the Papuan as pneumonic plague to the White. Alcohol, for"
4736,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"them, is disaster, degeneration, and death. Why? You can’t get ahead"
4737,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,of Cause and Effect. Protect any race from its natural and God-given
4738,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"bacteria and you automatically create the culture for its decay, when"
4739,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"that protection is removed. That, sir, is my Thesis.”"
4740,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4741,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"The unlit cigar between his lips circled slowly, but I had no desire to"
4742,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,laugh.
4743,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4744,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“The virgin Red Indian fell for the Firewater of the Paleface as soon
4745,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"as it was presented to him. For Firewater, sir, he parted with his"

4750,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Ne-mee-sis of Prohibition. And the Process has begun, sir. Haven’t you"
4751,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,noticed it already”--he gulped--“among Our People?”
4752,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4753,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“Well,” I said. “Men don’t always act as they preach, of course.”"
4754,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4755,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“You won’t abrade _my_ National Complex. What’s the worst you’ve seen
4756,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,in connection with Our People--and Rum?” The round lenses were full on
4757,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,me. I chanced it.
4758,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4759,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“I’ve seen one of ’em on a cross-Channel boat, talking Prohibition in"
4760,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,the bar--pretty full. He had three drinks while I listened.”
4761,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4762,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“I thought you said you’d never quit England?” he replied.
4763,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4764,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“Oh, we don’t count France,” I amended hastily."
4765,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4766,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“Then was you ever at Monte Carlo? No? Well, I was--this spring. One of"
4767,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,our tourist steamers unloaded three hundred of ’em at the port o’ Veel

4769,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"out of the dinner-hall of that vast Hotel opp’site the Cassino there,"
4770,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"not drunk, but all--_all_ havin’ drink taken. In that hotel lounge"
4771,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"after that meal, I saw an elderly cit’zen up an’ kiss eight women,"
4772,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"none of ’em specially young, sittin’ in a circle on the settees; the"
4773,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"rest of his crowd applaudin’. Folk just shrugged their shoulders, and"
4774,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"the French nigger on the door, I heard him say: ‘It’s only the Yanks"
4775,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"tankin’ up.’ It galled me. As a one-hundred-per-cent. American, it"
4776,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,galled me unspeakably. And _you’ve_ observed the same thing durin’ the
4777,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,last few years?”
4778,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4779,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,I nodded. The face was working now in the yellow lights reflected from
4780,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,the close-buttoned raincoat. He dropped his hand on his knee and struck
4781,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"it again and again, before he steadied himself with the usual snap and"
4782,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,grind of his superb dentist-work.
4783,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4784,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“My Rev’lation _qua_ the Peril of Prohibition was laid on me on my
4785,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,return back home in the hour of my affliction. I’d been discussin’
4786,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Prohibition with Mrs. Tarworth only the week before. Her best friend,"
4787,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"sir, a neighbour of ours, had filled one of the vases in our parlour"
4788,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,with chrysanthemums out of a bust wreath. I can’t ever smell to those
4789,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"flowers now ’thout it all comin’ back. Yes, sir, in my hour of woe"
4790,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,it was laid on me to warn my land of the Ne-mee-sis of Presumption.
4791,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,There’s only one Sin in the world--and that is Presumption. Without
4792,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"strong Presumption, sir, we’d never have fixed Prohibition the way we"
4793,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,did.... An’ when I retired that night I reasoned it out that there was
4794,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,but one weapon for me to work with to convey my message to my native
4795,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"land. That, sir, was the Movies. So I reasoned it. I reasoned it"
4796,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"so-oo! Now the Movies wasn’t a business I’d ever been interested in,"
4797,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"though a regular attendant.... Well, sir, within ten days after I had"
4798,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"realised the Scope an’ Imperativeness of my Rev’lation, I’d sold out"
4799,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"an’ re-invested so’s everything was available. I quit Omaha, sir, the"
4800,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,freest--the happiest--man in the United States.”
4801,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4802,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,A puff of air from the woods licked through the open door of the
4803,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"caravan, trailing a wreath of mist with it. He pushed home the door."
4804,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4805,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“So you started in on Anti-Prohibition films?” I suggested.
4806,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4807,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“Sir?--More! It was laid on me to feature the Murder of Immunised
4808,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,America by the Microbe of Modern Civ’lisation which she had
4809,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,presumptuously defied. That text inspired all the titling. Before
4810,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"I arrived at the concept of the Appeal, I was months studyin’ the"
4811,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Movie business in every State of Our Union, in labour and trava-il."
4812,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"The Complete Concept, sir, with its Potential’ties, came to me of a"
4813,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Sunday afternoon in Rand Park, Keokuk, Iowa--the centre of our native"
4814,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"pearl-button industry. As a boy, sir, I used to go shell-tongin’ after"
4815,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"mussels, in a shanty-boat on the Cumberland River, Tennessee, always"
4816,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,hopin’ to find a thousand dollar pearl. (The shell goes to Keokuk for
4817,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,manufacture.) I found my pearl in Keokuk--where my Concept came to me!
4818,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Excuse me!”
4819,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4820,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"He pulled out a drawer of card-indexed photographs beneath the bunk,"
4821,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"ran his long fingers down the edges, and drew out three."
4822,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4823,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,The first showed the head of an elderly Red Indian chief in full
4824,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"war-paint, the lined lips compressed to a thread, eyes wrinkled,"
4825,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"nostrils aflare, and the whole face lit by so naked a passion of hate"
4826,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,that I started.
4827,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4828,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“That,” said Mr. Tarworth, “is the Spirit of the Tragedy--both of the"
4829,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Red Indians who initially, and of our Whites who subsequently, sold"
4830,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,’emselves and their heritage for the Firewater of the Paleface. The
4831,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Captions run in diapason with that note throughout. But for a Film
4832,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Appeal, you must have a balanced _leet-motif_ interwoven with the"
4833,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"footage. Now this close-up of the Red Man I’m showin’ you, punctuates"
4834,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"the action of the dramma. He recurs, sir, watchin’ the progressive"
4835,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"degradation of his own people, from the advent of the Paleface"
4836,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"with liquor, up to the extinction of his race. After that, you see"
4837,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"him, again, more and more dominant, broodin’ over an’ rejoicin’ in"
4838,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,the downfall of the White American artificially virg’nised against
4839,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Alcohol--the identical cycle repeated. I got this shot of Him in
4840,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Oklahoma, one of our Western States, where there’s a crowd of the"
4841,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,richest Red Indians (drawin’ oil-royalties) on earth. But they’ve got
4842,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,a Historical Society that chases ’em into paint and feathers to keep
4843,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"up their race-pride, _and_ for the Movies. He was an Episcopalian"
4844,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"and owns a Cadillac, I was told. The sun in his eyes makes him look"
4845,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,that way. He’s indexed as ‘Rum-in-the-Cup’ (that’s the element of
4846,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Popular Appeal), but, say”--the voice softened with the pride of"
4847,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,artistry--“ain’t He just _it_ for my purposes?”
4848,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4849,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,He passed me the second photo. The cigar rolled again and he held on:
4850,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4851,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“Now in every Film Appeal, you must balance your _leet-motif_ by"
4852,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"balancin’ the Sexes. The American Women, sir, handed Prohibition to"
4853,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Us while our boys were away savin’ _you_. I know the type--’born an’
4854,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,bred with it. She watches throughout the film what She’s brought
4855,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,about--watches an’ watches till the final Catastrophe. She’s Woman
4856,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Triumphant, balanced against Rum-in-the-Cup--the Degraded Male."
4857,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"I hunted the whole of the Middle West for Her in vain, ’fore I"
4858,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"remembered--not Jordan, but Abanna and Parphar--Mrs. Tarworth’s best"
4859,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"friend at home. I was then in Texarkhana, Arkansas, fixin’ up a deal"
4860,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,I’ll tell you about; but I broke for Omaha that evenin’ to get a shot
4861,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"of Her. When I arrived so sudden she--she--thought, I guess, I meant"
4862,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"to make her Number Two. That’s Her. You wouldn’t realise the Type, but"
4863,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,it’s _it_.”
4864,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4865,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,I looked; saw the trained sweetness and unction in the otherwise
4866,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"hardish, ignorant eyes; the slightly open, slightly flaccid mouth; the"
4867,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"immense unconscious arrogance, the immovable certitude of mind, and"
4868,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,the other warning signs in the poise of the broad-cheeked head. He was
4869,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,fingering the third photo.
4870,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4871,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“And when the American Woman realises the Scope an’ the Impact an’
4872,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,the Irrevocability of the Catastrophe which she has created by Her
4873,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Presumption, She--She registers Despair. That’s Her--at the finale.”"
4874,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4875,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,It was cruelty beyond justification to have pinned down any living
4876,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"creature in such agony of shame, anger, and impotence among life’s"
4877,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"wreckage. And this was a well-favoured woman, her torment new-launched"
4878,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,on her as she stood gripping the back of a stamped-velvet chair.
4879,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4880,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“And so you went back to Texarkhana without proposing,” I began."
4881,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4882,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“Why, yes. There was only forty-seven minutes between trains. I told"
4883,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,her so. But I got both shots.”
4884,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4885,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"I must have caught my breath, for, as he took the photo back again,"
4886,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,he explained: “In the Movie business we don’t employ the actool. This
4887,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,is only the Basis we build on to the nearest professional type. That
4888,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,secures controlled emphasis of expression. She’s only the Basis.”
4889,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4890,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“I’m glad of that,” I said. He lit his cigar, and relaxed beneath the"
4891,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,folds of the loose coat.
4892,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4893,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“Well, sir, having secured my _leet-motifs_ and Sex-balances, the"
4894,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,whole of the footage coverin’ the downfall of the Red Man was as good
4895,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,as given me by a bust Congregational Church that had been boosting
4896,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Prohibition near Texarkhana. That was why I’d gone there. One of their
4897,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"ladies, who was crazy about Our National dealin’s with the Indian, had"
4898,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,had the details documented in Washington; an’ the resultant film must
4899,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,have cost her any God’s dollars you can name. It was all there--the Red
4900,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Man partin’ with his lands and furs an’ women to the early settlers for
4901,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Rum; the liquor-fights round the tradin’-posts; the Government Agents
4902,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,swindlin’ ’em with liquor; an’ the Indians goin’ mad from it; the Black
4903,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Hawk War; the winnin’ of the West--by Rum mainly--the whole jugful of
4904,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Shame. But that film failed, sir, because folk in Arkansaw said it was"
4905,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"an aspersion on the National Honour, and, anyway, buying land needful"
4906,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,for Our inevitable development was more Christian than the bloody
4907,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,wars of Monarchical Europe. The Congregationalists wanted a new organ
4908,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,too; so I traded a big Estey organ for their film. My notion was to
4909,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"interweave it with parallel modern instances, from Monte Carlo and the"
4910,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"European hotels, of White American Degradation; the Main Caption bein’:"
4911,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,‘The Firewater of the Paleface Works as Indifferently as Fate.’ An’ old
4912,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Rum-in-the-Cup’s close-up shows broodin’--broodin’--broodin’--through
4913,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,it all! You sense my Concept?”
4914,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4915,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,He relighted his cigar.
4916,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4917,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“_I_ saw it like a vision. But, from there on, I had to rely on my"
4918,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,own Complex for intuition. I cut out all modern side-issues--the
4919,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,fight against Prohibition; bootlegging; home-made Rum manufacture;
4920,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"wood-alcohol tragedies, an’ all that dope. ’Dunno as I didn’t elim’nate"

4925,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4926,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“Vital! They clean up waste and deleterious matter in the humane

4929,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Corpuscules turn on the humane system an’ destroy it bodily. Mentally,"
4930,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"too, mebbe. Ain’t that a hell of a thought?”"
4931,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4932,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“Where did you get it from?”
4933,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4934,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“It came to me--with the others,” he replied as simply as Ezekiel might"
4935,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,have told a fellow-captive beside Chebar. “But it’s too high for a
4936,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Democracy. So I cut it right out. For Film purposes I assumed that,"
4937,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"at an unspecified date, the United States had become virg’nised to"
4938,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"liquor. The Taint was out of the Blood, and, apparently, the Instinct"
4939,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,had aborted. ‘The Triumph of Presumption’ is the Caption. But from
4940,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"there on, I fell down because, for the film Appeal, you cannot present"
4941,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"such an Epoch without featurin’ confirmatory exhibits which, o’ course,"
4942,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,haven’t as yet materialised. That meant that the whole Cultural Aspect
4943,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,o’ that Civ’lisation of the Future would have to be built up at
4944,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Hollywood; an’ half a million dollars wouldn’t cover it. ‘The Vision of
4945,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Virg’nised Civ’lisation.’ A hell of a proposition! But it don’t matter
4946,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,now.”
4947,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4948,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,He dropped his head and was still for a little.
4949,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4950,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“Never mind,” I said. “How does the idea work out--in your mind?”"
4951,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4952,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“In my mind? As inevitably, sir, as the Red Man’s Fall through"
4953,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Rum. My notion was a complete Cultural Exposay of a She-dom’nated
4954,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Civ’lisation, built on a virginal basis _qua_ alcohol, with immensely"
4955,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"increased material Productivity (say, there’d be money in that from big"
4956,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Businesses demonstratin’ what they’ll prodooce a hundred years hence),"
4957,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,_and_ a side-wipe at the practically non-existent birth-rate.”
4958,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4959,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“Why that, too?” I asked."
4960,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4961,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,He gave me the reason--a perfectly sound one--which has nothing to do
4962,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"with the tale, and went on:"
4963,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4964,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“After that Vision is fully realised, the End comes--as remorselessly"
4965,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,for the White as for the Red. How? The American Woman--you will recall
4966,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"the first close-up of that lady I showed you, interweavin’ throughout"
4967,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"the narr’tive--havin’ accomplished all she set out to do, wishes to"
4968,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,demonstrate to the world the Integral Significance of Her Life-work.
4969,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Why not? She’s never been blamed in Her life. So delib’rately, out"
4970,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"of High Presumption, the American Woman withdraws all inhibit’ry"
4971,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"legislation, all barriers against Alcohol--to show what She has made of"
4972,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Her Men. The Captions here run--‘The Zeenith of Presumption. America
4973,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Stands by Herself--Guide and Saviour of Humanity.’ ‘Let Evil do Its
4974,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Damnedest! We are above It.’ Say, ain’t that a hell of a thought?”"
4975,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4976,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“A bit extravagant, isn’t it?”"
4977,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
4978,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“Extrav’gance? In the life of actool men an’ women? It don’t exist.
4979,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Well, anyway, that’s my top-note before the _day-bakkle_. There’s an"
4980,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,interval while the Great World-Wave is gatherin’ to sweep aside the
4981,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Children of Presumption. Nothin’ eventuates for a while. The Machine of
4982,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Virg’nised Civ’lisation functions by its own stored energy. And then,"
4983,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,sir--_then_ the World-Wave crashes down on the White as it crashed on
4984,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,the Red Skin! (All this while old Rum-in-the-Cup is growin’ more an’
4985,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"more dom’nant, as I told you.) But now, owin’ to the artificialised"
4986,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"mentality of the victims and the immune pop’lation, its effects are"
4987,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Cataclysmic. ‘The Alcohol Appeal, held back for five Generations, wakes"
4988,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"like a Cyclone.’ That’s the Horror I’m stressin’. And Europe, and Asia,"
4989,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,and the Ghetto exploit America--cold. ‘A Virg’nised People let go all
4990,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"holts, and part with their All.’ It is no longer a Dom’nation--but an"
4991,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Obsession. Then a _Po_-ssession! Then come the Levelled Bay’nets of
4992,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Europe. Why so? Because the liquor’s peddled out, sir, under armed"
4993,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"European guards to the elderly, pleadin’ American Whites who pass over"
4994,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"their title-deeds--their businesses, fact’ries, canals, sky-scrapers,"
4995,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"town-lots, farms, little happy-lookin’ homes--everything--for it. You"
4996,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"can see ’em wadin’ into the ocean, from Oyster Bay to Palm Beach, under"
4997,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"great flarin’ sunsets of National Decay, to get at the stuff sooner."
4998,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"And Europe’s got ’em by the gullet--peddlin’ out the cases, or a single"
4999,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"bottle at a time, to each accordin’ to his need--under the Levelled"
5000,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Bay’nets of Europe.”
5001,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5002,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“But why lay all the responsibility on Europe?” I broke in. “Surely
5003,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,some progressive American Liquor Trust would have been in the game from
5004,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,the first?”
5005,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5006,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“Sure! But the Appeal is National, and there are some things, sir, that"
5007,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,the American People will _not_ stand for. It was Europe or nothing.
5008,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Otherwise, I could not have stressed the effect of the Levelled"
5009,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Bay’nets of Europe. You see those bay’nets keepin’ order in the vast
5010,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,cathedrals of the new religions--the broken whisky bottles round the
5011,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"altar--the Priest himself, old and virg’nised, pleadin’ and prayin’"
5012,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"with his flock till, in the zeenith of his agony an’ his denunciations,"
5013,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,he too falls an’ wallows with the rest of ’em! Extrav’gant? No!
5014,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Logic. An’ so it spreads, from West to East, from East to West up to"
5015,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,the dividin’ line where the European and the Asiatic Liquor Trust
5016,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,has parcelled out the Land o’ Presumption. No paltry rum-peddlin’ at
5017,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"tradin’-posts _this_ time, but mile-long electric freight-trains,"
5018,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,surgin’ and swoopin’ from San Francisco an’ Boston with their seven
5019,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"thousand ton of alcohol, till they meet head-on at the Liquor Line, an’"
5020,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,you see the little American People fawnin’ an’ pleadin’ round their
5021,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,big wheels an’ tryin’ to slip in under the Levelled Bay’nets of Europe
5022,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"to handle and touch the stuff, even if they can’t drink it. It’s"
5023,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,horrible--horrible! ‘The Wages of Sin!’ ‘The Death of the She-Dom’nated
5024,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Sons of Presumption!’”
5025,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5026,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"He stood up, his head high in the caravan’s resonant roof, and mopped"
5027,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,his face.
5028,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5029,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“Go on!” I said.
5030,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5031,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“There ain’t much more. You see the devirg’nised European an’ the
5032,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"immemorially sophisticated Asiatic, who can hold their liquor,"
5033,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,spreadin’ out an’ occupyin’ the land (the signs in the streets register
5034,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"that) like--like a lavva-flow in Honolulu. There’s jest a hint, too, of"
5035,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"the Return of the Great Scourge, an’ how it fed on all this fresh human"
5036,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,meat. Jest a few feet of the flesh rottin’ off the bones--’same as
5037,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,when Syph’lis originated in the Re-nay-sanse Epoch. Last of all--date
5038,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,not specified--will be the herdin’ of the few survivin’ Americans into
5039,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"their reservation in the Yellowstone Park by a few slouchin’, crippled"
5040,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,remnants of the Redskins. ’Get me? ‘Presumption’s Ultimate Reward.’
5041,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,‘The Wheel Comes Full Circle.’ An’ the final close-up of Rum-in-the-Cup
5042,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,with his Hate-Mission accomplished.”
5043,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5044,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,He stooped again to the photos in the bunk-locker.
5045,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5046,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“I shot that,” he said, “when I was in the Yellowstone. It’s a document"
5047,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,to build up my Last Note on. They’re jest a party of tourists watchin’
5048,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,grizzly bears rakin’ in the hotel dump-heaps (they keep ’em to show).
5049,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"That wet light hits back well off their clothes, don’t it?”"
5050,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5051,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"I saw six or seven men and women, in pale-coloured raincoats, gathered,"
5052,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"with no pretence at pose, in a little glade. One man was turning up"
5053,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"his collar, another stooping to a bootlace, while a woman opened her"
5054,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,umbrella over him. They faced towards a dimly defined heap of rubbish
5055,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,and tins; and they looked unutterably mean.
5056,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5057,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“Yes.” He took it back from me. “That would have been the final
5058,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,note--the dom’nant resolvin’ into a minor. But it don’t matter now.”
5059,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5060,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“Doesn’t it?” I said, stupidly enough."
5061,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5062,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“Not to me, sir. My Church--I’m a Fundamentalist, an’ I didn’t read ’em"
5063,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,more than half the scenario--started out by disownin’ me for aspersin’
5064,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,the National Honour. A bunch of our home papers got holt of it next.
5065,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,They said I was a ren’gade an’ done it for dollars. An’ then the
5066,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,ladies on the Social Betterment an’ Uplift Committees took a hand. In
5067,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,_your_ country you don’t know the implications of _that_! I’m--I’m a
5068,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"one-hundred-per-cent. American, but--I didn’t know what men an’ women"
5069,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"are. I guess none of us do at home, or we’d say so, instead o’ playin’"
5070,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,at being American Cit’zens. There’s no law with Us under which a man
5071,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,can be jailed for aspersin’ the National Honour. There’s no need. It
5072,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"got into the Legislature, an’ one Senator there he spoke for an hour,"
5073,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,demandin’ to have me unanimously an’ internationally disavowed by--by
5074,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"my Maker, I presoom. No one else stood by me. I’d been to the big Jew"
5075,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,combines that control the Movie business in our country. I’d been to
5076,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Heuvelstein--he represents sixty-seven millions dollars’ interests.
5077,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,They say he’s never read a scenario in his life. He read every last
5078,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"word of mine aloud. He laughed some, but he said he was doin’ well in"
5079,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"a small way, and he didn’t propose to start up any pogroms against the"
5080,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Chosen in New York. He said I was ahead of my time. I know that. An’
5081,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,then--my wife’s best friend was back of this--folk at home got talkin’
5082,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"about callin’ for an inquiry into my state o’ mind, an’ whether I was"
5083,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"fit to run my own affairs. I saw a lawyer or two over that, an’ I came"
5084,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,to a realisin’ sense of American Law _an’_ Justice. That was another
5085,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"of the things I didn’t know. It made me sick to my stummick, sir--sick"
5086,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,with physical an’ mental terror an’ dread. So I quit. I changed my
5087,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,name an’ quit two years back. Those ancient prophets an’ martyrs
5088,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,haven’t got much on me in the things a Democracy hands you if you don’t
5089,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"see eye to eye with it. Therefore, I have no abidin’-place except this"
5090,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"old caravan. Now sir, we two are like ships that pass in the night,"
5091,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"except, as I said, I’ll be very pleased to tow you into Doncaster this"
5092,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,morning. Is there anythin’ about _me_ strikes _you_ in any way as
5093,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,deviatin’ from sanity?”
5094,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5095,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“Not in the least,” I replied quickly. “But what have you done with"
5096,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,your scenario?”
5097,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5098,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“Deposited it in the Bank of England at London.”
5099,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5100,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“Would you sell it?”
5101,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5102,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“_No_, sir.”"
5103,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5104,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“Couldn’t it be produced here?”
5105,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5106,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“I am a one-hundred-per-cent. American. The way _I_ see it, I could not"
5107,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,be a party to an indirect attack on my Native Land.”
5108,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5109,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Once again he ground his jaws. There did not seem to be much left to
5110,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,say. The heat in the shut caravan was more and more oppressive. Time
5111,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,had stood still with me listening. I was aware now that the owls had
5112,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,ceased hooting and that a night had gone out of the world. I rose from
5113,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"the bunk. Mr. Tarworth, carefully rebuttoning his raincoat, opened the"
5114,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,door.
5115,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5116,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“Good Lord Gord Almighty!” he cried with a child’s awed reverence.
5117,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,“It’s sun-up. Look!”
5118,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5119,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Daylight was just on the heels of dawn, with the sun following. The"
5120,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,icy-blackness of the Great North Road banded itself with smoking mists
5121,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"that changed from solid pearl to writhing opal, as they lifted above"
5122,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,hedge-row level. The dew-wet leaves of the upper branches turned
5123,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"suddenly into diamond facets, and that wind, which runs before the"
5124,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"actual upheaval of the sun, swept out of the fragrant lands to the"
5125,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"East, and touched my cheek--as many times it had touched it before, on"
5126,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"the edge, or at the ends, of inconceivable experiences."
5127,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5128,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"My companion breathed deeply, while the low glare searched the folds"
5129,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,of his coat and the sags and wrinkles of his face. We heard the
5130,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"far-away pulse of a car through the infinite, clean-born, light-filled"
5131,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,stillness. It neared and stole round the bend--a motor-hearse on its
5132,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"way to some early or distant funeral, one side of the bright oak coffin"
5133,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"showing beneath the pall, which had slipped a little. Then it vanished"
5134,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"in a blaze of wet glory from the sun-drenched road, amid the songs of a"
5135,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,thousand birds.
5136,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5137,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Mr. Tarworth laid his hand on my shoulder.
5138,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5139,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"“Say, Neighbour,” he said. “There’s somethin’ very soothin’ in the"
5140,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,Concept of Death after all.”
5141,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,
5142,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Then he set himself, kindly and efficiently, to tow me towards"
5143,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"Doncaster, where, when the day’s life should begin again, one might"
5144,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,procure a new magneto make-and-break--that tiny two-inch spring of
5145,THE PROPHET AND THE COUNTRY,"finest steel, failure of which immobilises any car."

5268,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Westward from a town by the Mouths of the Rhône, runs a road so"
5269,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"mathematically straight, so barometrically level, that it ranks among"
5270,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,the world’s measured miles and motorists use it for records.
5271,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5272,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"I had attacked the distance several times, but always with a Mistral"
5273,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"blowing, or the unchancy cattle of those parts on the move. But once,"
5274,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"running from the East, into a high-piled, almost Egyptian, sunset,"
5275,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,there came a night which it would have been sin to have wasted. It was
5276,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,warm with the breath of summer in advance; moonlit till the shadow of
5277,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,every rounded pebble and pointed cypress wind-break lay solid on that
5278,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"vast flat-floored waste; and my Mr. Leggatt, who had slipped out to"
5279,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"make sure, reported that the road-surface was unblemished."
5280,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5281,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"“_Now_,” he suggested, “we might see what she’ll do under strict"
5282,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,road-conditions. She’s been pullin’ like the Blue de Luxe all day.
5283,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Unless I’m all off, it’s her night out.”"
5284,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5285,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,We arranged the trial for after dinner--thirty kilometres as near as
5286,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,might be; and twenty-two of them without even a level crossing.
5287,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5288,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"There sat beside me at table d’hôte an elderly, bearded Frenchman"
5289,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,wearing the rosette of by no means the lowest grade of the Legion of
5290,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Honour, who had arrived in a talkative Citroën. I gathered that he"
5291,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,had spent much of his life in the French Colonial Service in Annam
5292,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"and Tonquin. When the War came, his years barring him from the front"
5293,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"line, he had supervised Chinese woodcutters who, with axe and dynamite,"
5294,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,deforested the centre of France for trench-props. He said my chauffeur
5295,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,had told him that I contemplated an experiment. He was interested in
5296,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"cars--had admired mine--would, in short, be greatly indebted to me if I"
5297,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"permitted him to assist as an observer. One could not well refuse; and,"
5298,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"knowing my Mr. Leggatt, it occurred to me there might also be a bet in"
5299,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,the background.
5300,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5301,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"While he went to get his coat, I asked the proprietor his name."
5302,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"“Voiron--Monsieur André Voiron,” was the reply. “And his business?”"
5303,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"“Mon Dieu! He is Voiron! He is all those things, there!” The proprietor"
5304,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"waved his hands at brilliant advertisements on the dining-room walls,"
5305,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"which declared that Voiron Frères dealt in wines, agricultural"
5306,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"implements, chemical manures, provisions and produce throughout that"
5307,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,part of the globe.
5308,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5309,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"He said little for the first five minutes of our trip, and nothing at"
5310,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"all for the next ten--it being, as Leggatt had guessed, Esmeralda’s"
5311,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"night out. But, when her indicator climbed to a certain figure and held"
5312,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"there for three blinding kilometres, he expressed himself satisfied,"
5313,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,and proposed to me that we should celebrate the event at the hotel. “I
5314,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"keep yonder,” said he, “a wine on which I should value your opinion.”"
5315,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5316,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"On our return, he disappeared for a few minutes, and I heard him"
5317,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,rumbling in a cellar. The proprietor presently invited me to the
5318,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"dining-room, where, beneath one frugal light, a table had been set with"
5319,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"local dishes of renown. There was, too, a bottle beyond most known"
5320,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"sizes, marked black on red, with a date. Monsieur Voiron opened it, and"
5321,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"we drank to the health of my car. The velvety, perfumed liquor, between"
5322,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"fawn and topaz, neither too sweet nor too dry, creamed in its generous"
5323,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"glass. But I knew no wine composed of the whispers of angels’ wings,"
5324,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,the breath of Eden and the foam and pulse of Youth renewed. So I asked
5325,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,what it might be.
5326,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5327,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"“It is champagne,” he said gravely."
5328,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5329,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“Then what have I been drinking all my life?”
5330,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5331,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"“If you were lucky, before the War, and paid thirty shillings a bottle,"
5332,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,it is possible you may have drunk one of our better-class _tisanes_.”
5333,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5334,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“And where does one get this?”
5335,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5336,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"“Here, I am happy to say. Elsewhere, perhaps, it is not so easy. We"
5337,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,growers exchange these real wines among ourselves.”
5338,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5339,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"I bowed my head in admiration, surrender, and joy. There stood the"
5340,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"most ample bottle, and it was not yet eleven o’clock. Doors locked and"
5341,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,shutters banged throughout the establishment. Some last servant yawned
5342,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,on his way to bed. Monsieur Voiron opened a window and the moonlight
5343,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,flooded in from a small pebbled court outside. One could almost hear
5344,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"the town of Chambres breathing in its first sleep. Presently, there was"
5345,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"a thick noise in the air, the passing of feet and hooves, lowings, and"
5346,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"a stifled bark or two. Dust rose over the courtyard wall, followed by"
5347,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,the strong smell of cattle.
5348,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5349,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"“They are moving some beasts,” said Monsieur Voiron, cocking an"
5350,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"ear. “Mine, I think. Yes, I hear Christophe. Our beasts do not like"
5351,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,automobiles--so we move at night. You do not know our country--the
5352,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Crau, here, or the Camargue? I was--I am now, again--of it. All France"
5353,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"is good; but this is the best.” He spoke, as only a Frenchman can, of"
5354,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,his own loved part of his own lovely land.
5355,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5356,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"“For myself, if I were not so involved in all these affairs,” he"
5357,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,pointed to the advertisements--“I would live on our farm with my
5358,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"cattle, and worship them like a Hindu. You know our cattle of the"
5359,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Camargue, Monsieur. No? It is not an acquaintance to rush upon lightly."
5360,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,There are no beasts like them. They have a mentality superior to that
5361,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"of others. They graze and they ruminate, by choice, facing our Mistral,"
5362,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,which is more than some automobiles will do. Also they have in them
5363,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,the potentiality of thought--and when cattle think--I have seen what
5364,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,arrives.”
5365,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5366,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“Are they so clever as all that?” I asked idly.
5367,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5368,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"“Monsieur, when your sportif chauffeur camouflaged your limousine so"
5369,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"that she resembled one of your Army lorries, I would not believe her"
5370,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,capacities. I bet him--ah--two to one--she would not touch ninety
5371,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"kilometres. It was proved that she could. I can give you no proof, but"
5372,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,will you believe me if I tell you what a beast who thinks can achieve?”
5373,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5374,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"“After the War,” said I spaciously, “everything is credible.”"
5375,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5376,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“That is true! Everything inconceivable has happened; but still we
5377,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,learn nothing and we believe nothing. When I was a child in my father’s
5378,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,house--before I became a Colonial Administrator--my interest and my
5379,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,affection were among our cattle. We of the old rock live here--have
5380,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"you seen?--in big farms like castles. Indeed, some of them may have"
5381,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"been Saracenic. The barns group round them--great white-walled barns,"
5382,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,and yards solid as our houses. One gate shuts all. It is a world
5383,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,apart; an administration of all that concerns beasts. It was there I
5384,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"learned something about cattle. You see, they are our playthings in"
5385,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,the Camargue and the Crau. The boy measures his strength against the
5386,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,calf that butts him in play among the manure-heaps. He moves in and out
5387,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"among the cows, who are--not so amiable. He rides with the herdsmen"
5388,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"in the open to shift the herds. Sooner or later, he meets as bulls"
5389,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,the little calves that knocked him over. So it was with me--till it
5390,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,became necessary that I should go to our Colonies.” He laughed. “Very
5391,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"necessary. That is a good time in youth, Monsieur, when one does"
5392,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,these things which shock our parents. Why is it always Papa who is so
5393,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,shocked and has never heard of such things--and Mamma who supplies the
5394,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,excuses?... And when my brother--my elder who stayed and created the
5395,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"business--begged me to return and help him, I resigned my Colonial"
5396,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"career gladly enough. I returned to our own lands, and my well-loved,"
5397,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"wicked white and yellow cattle of the Camargue and the Crau. My Faith,"
5398,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"I could talk of them all night, for this stuff unlocks the heart,"
5399,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,without making repentance in the morning.... Yes! It was after the War
5400,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"that this happened. There was a calf, among Heaven knows how many of"
5401,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,ours--a bull-calf--an infant indistinguishable from his companions.
5402,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"He was sick, and he had been taken up with his mother into the big"
5403,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,farmyard at home with us. Naturally the children of our herdsmen
5404,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,practised on him from the first. It is in their blood. The Spaniards
5405,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,make a cult of bull-fighting. Our little devils down here bait bulls
5406,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,as automatically as the English child kicks or throws balls. This
5407,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"calf would chase them with his eyes open, like a cow when she hunts"
5408,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,a man. They would take refuge behind our tractors and wine-carts in
5409,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,the centre of the yard: he would chase them in and out as a dog hunts
5410,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"rats. More than that, he would study their psychology, his eyes in"
5411,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"their eyes. Yes, he watched their faces to divine which way they would"
5412,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"run. He himself, also, would pretend sometimes to charge directly at"
5413,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,a boy. Then he would wheel right or left--one could never tell--and
5414,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,knock over some child pressed against a wall who thought himself safe.
5415,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"After this, he would stand over him, knowing that his companions must"
5416,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"come to his aid; and when they were all together, waving their jackets"
5417,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"across his eyes and pulling his tail, he would scatter them--how he"
5418,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"would scatter them! He could kick too, sideways like a cow. He knew"
5419,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"his ranges as well as our gunners, and he was as quick on his feet as"
5420,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,our Carpentier. I observed him often. Christophe--the man who passed
5421,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"just now--our chief herdsman, who had taught me to ride with our beasts"
5422,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,when I was ten--Christophe told me that he was descended from a yellow
5423,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,cow of those days that had chased us once into the marshes. ‘He kicks
5424,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"just like her,’ said Christophe. ‘He can side-kick as he jumps. Have"
5425,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"you seen, too, that he is not deceived by the jacket when a boy waves"
5426,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,it? He uses it to find the boy. They think they are feeling him. He
5427,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"is feeling them always. He thinks, that one.’ I had come to the same"
5428,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,conclusion. Yes--the creature was a thinker along the lines necessary
5429,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"to his sport; and he was a humorist also, like so many natural"
5430,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,murderers. One knows the type among beasts as well as among men. It
5431,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,possesses a curious truculent mirth--almost indecent but infallibly
5432,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,significant----”
5433,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5434,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,Monsieur Voiron replenished our glasses with the great wine that went
5435,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,better at each descent.
5436,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5437,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“They kept him for some time in the yards to practise upon. Naturally
5438,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,he became a little brutal; so Christophe turned him out to learn
5439,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"manners among his equals in the grazing lands, where the Camargue joins"
5440,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"the Crau. How old was he then? About eight or nine months, I think. We"
5441,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,met again a few months later--he and I. I was riding one of our little
5442,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"half-wild horses, along a road of the Crau, when I found myself almost"
5443,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,unseated. It was he! He had hidden himself behind a wind-break till
5444,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"we passed, and had then charged my horse from behind. Yes, he had"
5445,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,deceived even my little horse! But I recognised him. I gave him the
5446,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"whip across the nose, and I said: ‘Apis, for this thou goest to Arles!"
5447,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"It was unworthy of thee, between us two.’ But that creature had no"
5448,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"shame. He went away laughing, like an Apache. If he had dismounted me,"
5449,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,I do not think it is I who would have laughed--yearling as he was.”
5450,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5451,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“Why did you want to send him to Arles?” I asked.
5452,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5453,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"“For the bull-ring. When your charming tourists leave us, we institute"
5454,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"our little amusements there. Not a real bull-fight, you understand,"
5455,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"but young bulls with padded horns, and our boys from hereabouts and in"
5456,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"the city, go to play with them. Naturally, before we send them we try"
5457,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,them in our yards at home. So we brought up Apis from his pastures.
5458,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,He knew at once that he was among the friends of his youth--he almost
5459,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,shook hands with them--and he submitted like an angel to padding his
5460,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"horns. He investigated the carts and tractors in the yards, to choose"
5461,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"his lines of defence and attack. And then--he attacked with an _élan_,"
5462,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,and he defended with a tenacity and forethought that delighted us. In
5463,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"truth, we were so pleased that I fear we trespassed upon his patience."
5464,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"We desired him to repeat himself, which no true artist will tolerate."
5465,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"But he gave us fair warning. He went out to the centre of the yard,"
5466,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,where there was some dry earth; he kneeled down and--you have seen a
5467,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,calf whose horns fret him thrusting and rooting into a bank? He did
5468,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"just that, very deliberately, till he had rubbed the pads off his"
5469,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"horns. Then he rose, dancing on those wonderful feet that twinkled, and"
5470,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"he said: ‘Now, my friends, the buttons are off the foils. Who begins?’"
5471,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,We understood. We finished at once. He was turned out again on the
5472,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,pastures till it should be time to amuse them at our little metropolis.
5473,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"But, some time before he went to Arles--yes, I think I have it"
5474,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"correctly--Christophe, who had been out on the Crau, informed me that"
5475,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,Apis had assassinated a young bull who had given signs of developing
5476,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"into a rival. That happens, of course, and our herdsmen should prevent"
5477,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"it. But Apis had killed in his own style--at dusk, from the ambush of"
5478,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,a wind-break--by an oblique charge from behind which knocked the other
5479,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"over. He had then disembowelled him. All very possible, _but_--the"
5480,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"murder accomplished--Apis went to the bank of a wind-break, knelt,"
5481,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"and carefully, as he had in our yard, cleaned his horns in the earth."
5482,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Christophe, who had never seen such a thing, at once borrowed (do you"
5483,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"know, it is most efficacious when taken that way?) some Holy Water from"
5484,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"our little chapel in those pastures, sprinkled Apis (whom it did not"
5485,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"affect), and rode in to tell me. It was obvious that a thinker of that"
5486,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"bull’s type would also be meticulous in his toilette; so, when he was"
5487,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"sent to Arles, I warned our consignees to exercise caution with him."
5488,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Happily, the change of scene, the music, the general attention, and the"
5489,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,meeting again with old friends--all our bad boys attended--agreeably
5490,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,distracted him. He became for the time a pure _farceur_ again; but his
5491,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"wheelings, his rushes, his rat-huntings were more superb than ever."
5492,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"There was in them now, you understand, a breadth of technique that"
5493,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"comes of reasoned art, and, above all, the passion that arrives after"
5494,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"experience. Oh, he had learned, out there on the Crau! At the end of"
5495,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"his little turn, he was, according to local rules, to be handled in all"
5496,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"respects except for the sword, which was a stick, as a professional"
5497,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"bull who must die. He was manœuvred into, or he posed himself in, the"
5498,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,proper attitude; made his rush; received the point on his shoulder and
5499,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,then--turned about and cantered toward the door by which he had entered
5500,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"the arena. He said to the world: ‘My friends, the representation is"
5501,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,ended. I thank you for your applause. I go to repose myself.’ But our
5502,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Arlesians, who are--not so clever as some, demanded an encore, and"
5503,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Apis was headed back again. We others from his country, we knew what"
5504,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"would happen. He went to the centre of the ring, kneeled, and, slowly,"
5505,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"with full parade, plunged his horns alternately in the dirt till the"
5506,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"pads came off. Christophe shouts: ‘Leave him alone, you straight-nosed"
5507,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,imbeciles! Leave him before you must.’ But they required emotion; for
5508,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,Rome has always debauched her loved Provincia with bread and circuses.
5509,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"It was given. Have you, Monsieur, ever seen a servant, with pan and"
5510,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"broom, sweeping round the baseboard of a room? In a half-minute Apis"
5511,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,has them all swept out and over the barrier. Then he demands once more
5512,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,that the door shall be opened to him. It is opened and he retires as
5513,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"though--which truly, is the case--loaded with laurels.”"
5514,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5515,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Monsieur Voiron refilled the glasses, and allowed himself a cigarette,"
5516,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,which he puffed for some time.
5517,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5518,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“And afterwards?” I said.
5519,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5520,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“I am arranging it in my mind. It is difficult to do it justice.
5521,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Afterwards--yes, afterwards--Apis returned to his pastures and his"
5522,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,mistresses and I to my business. I am no longer a scandalous old
5523,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,‘sportif’ in shirtsleeves howling encouragement to the yellow son of a
5524,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"cow. I revert to Voiron Frères--wines, chemical manures, _et cetera_."
5525,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"And next year, through some chicane which I have not the leisure to"
5526,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"unravel, and also, thanks to our patriarchal system of paying our older"
5527,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"men out of the increase of the herds, old Christophe possesses himself"
5528,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"of Apis. Oh, yes, he proves it through descent from a certain cow that"
5529,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"my father had given his father before the Republic. Beware, Monsieur,"
5530,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,of the memory of the illiterate man! An ancestor of Christophe had
5531,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"been a soldier under our Soult against your Beresford, near Bayonne. He"
5532,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,fell into the hands of Spanish guerrillas. Christophe and his wife used
5533,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"to tell me the details on certain Saints’ Days when I was a child. Now,"
5534,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"as compared with our recent war, Soult’s campaign and retreat across"
5535,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,the Bidassoa----”
5536,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5537,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“But did you allow Christophe just to annex the bull?” I demanded.
5538,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5539,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“You do not know Christophe. He had sold him to the Spaniards before he
5540,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,informed me. The Spaniards pay in coin--douros of very pure silver. Our
5541,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,peasants mistrust our paper. You know the saying: ‘A thousand francs
5542,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"paper; eight hundred metal, and the cow is yours.’ Yes, Christophe"
5543,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"sold Apis, who was then two and a half years old, and to Christophe’s"
5544,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,knowledge thrice at least an assassin.”
5545,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5546,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“How was that?” I said.
5547,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5548,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"“Oh, his own kind only; and always, Christophe told me, by the same"
5549,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"oblique rush from behind, the same sideways overthrow, and the same"
5550,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"swift disembowelment, followed by this levitical cleaning of the horns."
5551,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"In human life he would have kept a manicurist--this Minotaur. And so,"
5552,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,Apis disappears from our country. That does not trouble me. I know in
5553,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"due time I shall be advised. Why? Because, in this land, Monsieur, not"
5554,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,a hoof moves between Berre and the Saintes Maries without the knowledge
5555,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"of specialists such as Christophe. The beasts are the substance, and"
5556,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"the drama of their lives to them. So when Christophe tells me, a little"
5557,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"before Easter Sunday, that Apis makes his début in the bull-ring of"
5558,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"a small Catalan town on the road to Barcelona, it is only to pack my"
5559,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,car and trundle there across the frontier with him. The place lacked
5560,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"importance and manufactures, but it had produced a matador of some"
5561,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"reputation, who was condescending to show his art in his native town."
5562,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,They were even running one special train to the place. Now our French
5563,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"railway system is only execrable, but the Spanish----”"
5564,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5565,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"“You went down by road, didn’t you?” said I."
5566,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5567,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“Naturally. It was not too good. Villamarti was the matador’s name.
5568,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"He proposed to kill two bulls for the honour of his birthplace. Apis,"
5569,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Christophe told me, would be his second. It was an interesting trip,"
5570,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,and that little city by the sea was ravishing. Their bull-ring dates
5571,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,from the middle of the seventeenth century. It is full of feeling.
5572,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,The ceremonial too--when the horsemen enter and ask the Mayor in his
5573,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,box to throw down the keys of the bull-ring--that was exquisitely
5574,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"conceived. You know, if the keys are caught in the horseman’s hat, it"
5575,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,is considered a good omen. They were perfectly caught. Our seats were
5576,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"in the front row beside the gates where the bulls enter, so we saw"
5577,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,everything.
5578,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5579,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“Villamarti’s first bull was not too badly killed. The second
5580,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"matador, whose name escapes me, killed his without distinction--a"
5581,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"foil to Villamarti. And the third, Chisto, a laborious, middle-aged"
5582,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"professional who had never risen beyond a certain dull competence, was"
5583,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"equally of the background. Oh, they are as jealous as the girls of the"
5584,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Comédie Française, these matadors! Villamarti’s troupe stood ready"
5585,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"for his second bull. The gates opened, and we saw Apis, beautifully"
5586,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"balanced on his feet, peer coquettishly round the corner, as though he"
5587,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,were at home. A picador--a mounted man with the long lance-goad--stood
5588,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,near the barrier on his right. He had not even troubled to turn his
5589,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"horse, for the capeadors--the men with the cloaks--were advancing to"
5590,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"play Apis--to feel his psychology and intentions, according to the"
5591,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,rules that are made for bulls who do not think.... I did not realise
5592,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"the murder before it was accomplished! The wheel, the rush, the oblique"
5593,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"charge from behind, the fall of horse and man were simultaneous."
5594,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Apis leaped the horse, with whom he had no quarrel, and alighted,"
5595,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"all four feet together (it was enough), between the man’s shoulders,"
5596,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"changed his beautiful feet on the carcass, and was away, pretending to"
5597,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"fall nearly on his nose. Do you follow me? In that instant, by that"
5598,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"stumble, he produced the impression that his adorable assassination"
5599,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"was a mere bestial blunder. Then, Monsieur, I began to comprehend"
5600,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,that it was an artist we had to deal with. He did not stand over the
5601,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,body to draw the rest of the troupe. He chose to reserve that trick.
5602,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"He let the attendants bear out the dead, and went on to amuse himself"
5603,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"among the capeadors. Now to Apis, trained among our children in the"
5604,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"yards, the cloak was simply a guide to the boy behind it. He pursued,"
5605,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"you understand, the person, not the propaganda--the proprietor, not"
5606,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"the journal. If a third of our electors of France were as wise, my"
5607,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"friend!... But it was done leisurely, with humour and a touch of"
5608,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,truculence. He romped after one man’s cloak as a clumsy dog might
5609,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"do, but I observed that he kept the man on his terrible left side."
5610,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,Christophe whispered to me: ‘Wait for his mother’s kick. When he has
5611,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,made the fellow confident it will arrive.’ It arrived in the middle
5612,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,of a gambol. My God! He lashed out in the air as he frisked. The
5613,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"man dropped like a sack, lifted one hand a little towards his head,"
5614,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"and--that was all. So you see, a body was again at his disposition;"
5615,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"a second time the cloaks ran up to draw him off, but a second time,"
5616,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,Apis refused his grand scene. A second time he acted that his murder
5617,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,was accident and--he convinced his audience! It was as though he had
5618,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,knocked over a bridge-gate in the marshes by mistake. Unbelievable? I
5619,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,saw it.”
5620,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5621,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"The memory sent Monsieur Voiron again to the champagne, and I"
5622,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,accompanied him.
5623,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5624,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“But Apis was not the sole artist present. They say Villamarti comes
5625,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"of a family of actors. I saw him regard Apis with a new eye. He, too,"
5626,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,began to understand. He took his cloak and moved out to play him
5627,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,before they should bring on another picador. He had his reputation.
5628,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,Perhaps Apis knew it. Perhaps Villamarti reminded him of some boy with
5629,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,whom he had practised at home. At any rate Apis permitted it--up to a
5630,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,certain point; but he did not allow Villamarti the stage. He cramped
5631,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"him throughout. He dived and plunged clumsily and slowly, but always"
5632,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,with menace and always closing in. We could see that the man was
5633,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,conforming to the bull--not the bull to the man; for Apis was playing
5634,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"him towards the centre of the ring, and, in a little while--I watched"
5635,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,his face--Villamarti knew it. But I could not fathom the creature’s
5636,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"motive. ‘Wait,’ said old Christophe. ‘He wants that picador on the"
5637,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,white horse yonder. When he reaches his proper distance he will get
5638,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,him. Villamarti is his cover. He used me once that way.’ And so it
5639,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"was, my friend! With the clang of one of our own Seventy-fives, Apis"
5640,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,dismissed Villamarti with his chest--breasted him over--and had arrived
5641,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,at his objective near the barrier. The same oblique charge; the head
5642,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,carried low for the sweep of the horns; the immense sideways fall of
5643,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"the horse, broken-legged and half-paralysed; the senseless man on the"
5644,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"ground and--behold Apis between them, backed against the barrier--his"
5645,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,right covered by the horse; his left by the body of the man at his
5646,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,feet. The simplicity of it! Lacking the carts and tractors of his
5647,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"early parade-grounds he, being a genius, had extemporised with the"
5648,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"materials at hand, and dug himself in. The troupe closed up again,"
5649,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"their left wing broken by the kicking horse, their right immobilised"
5650,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,by the man’s body which Apis bestrode with significance. Villamarti
5651,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"almost threw himself between the horns, but--it was more an appeal than"
5652,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,an attack. Apis refused him. He held his base. A picador was sent at
5653,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"him--necessarily from the front, which alone was open. Apis charged--he"
5654,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"who, till then, you realise, had not used the horn! The horse went over"
5655,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"backwards, the man half beneath him. Apis halted, hooked him under"
5656,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"the heart, and threw him to the barrier. We heard his head crack, but"
5657,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,he was dead before he hit the wood. There was no demonstration from
5658,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"the audience. They, also, had begun to realise this Foch among bulls!"
5659,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,The arena occupied itself again with the dead. Two of the troupe
5660,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,irresolutely tried to play him--God knows in what hope!--but he moved
5661,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,out to the centre of the ring. ‘Look!’ said Christophe. ‘Now he goes to
5662,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,clean himself. That always frightened me.’ He knelt down; he began to
5663,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,clean his horns. The earth was hard. He worried at it in an ecstasy of
5664,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"absorption. As he laid his head along and rattled his ears, it was as"
5665,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"though he were interrogating the Devils themselves upon their secrets,"
5666,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"and always saying impatiently: ‘Yes, I know that--and _that_--and"
5667,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"_that_! Tell me more--_more_!’ In the silence that covered us, a woman"
5668,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"cried: ‘He digs a grave! Oh, Saints, he digs a grave!’ Some others"
5669,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,echoed this--not loudly--as a wave echoes in a grotto of the sea.
5670,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5671,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"“And when his horns were cleaned, he rose up and studied poor"
5672,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Villamarti’s troupe, eyes in eyes, one by one, with the gravity of an"
5673,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,equal in intellect and the remote and merciless resolution of a master
5674,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,in his art. This was more terrifying than his toilette.”
5675,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5676,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“And they--Villamarti’s men?” I asked.
5677,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5678,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"“Like the audience, were dominated. They had ceased to posture, or"
5679,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"stamp, or address insults to him. They conformed to him. The two other"
5680,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"matadors stared. Only Chisto, the oldest, broke silence with some"
5681,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"call or other, and Apis turned his head towards him. Otherwise he was"
5682,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"isolated, immobile--sombre--meditating on those at his mercy. Ah!"
5683,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5684,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“For some reason the trumpet sounded for the _banderillas_--those gay
5685,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,hooked darts that are planted in the shoulders of bulls who do not
5686,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"think, after their neck-muscles are tired by lifting horses. When such"
5687,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"bulls feel the pain, they check for an instant, and, in that instant,"
5688,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,the men step gracefully aside. Villamarti’s banderillero answered the
5689,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"trumpet mechanically--like one condemned. He stood out, poised the"
5690,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,darts and stammered the usual patter of invitation.... And after? I
5691,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"do not assert that Apis shrugged his shoulders, but he reduced the"
5692,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"episode to its lowest elements, as could only a bull of Gaul. With"
5693,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,his truculence was mingled always--owing to the shortness of his
5694,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"tail--a certain Rabelaisian abandon, especially when viewed from the"
5695,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"rear. Christophe had often commented upon it. Now, Apis brought that"
5696,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"quality into play. He circulated round that boy, forcing him to break"
5697,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"up his beautiful poses. He studied him from various angles, like an"
5698,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,incompetent photographer. He presented to him every portion of his
5699,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,anatomy except his shoulders. At intervals he feigned to run in upon
5700,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"him. My God, he was cruel! But his motive was obvious. He was playing"
5701,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,for a laugh from the spectators which should synchronise with the
5702,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,fracture of the human morale. It was achieved. The boy turned and ran
5703,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,towards the barrier. Apis was on him before the laugh ceased; passed
5704,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"him; headed him--what do I say?--herded him off to the left, his"
5705,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,horns beside and a little in front of his chest: he did not intend
5706,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,him to escape into a refuge. Some of the troupe would have closed
5707,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"in, but Villamarti cried: ‘If he wants him he will take him. Stand!’"
5708,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,They stood. Whether the boy slipped or Apis nosed him over I could
5709,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"not see. But he dropped, sobbing. Apis halted like a car with four"
5710,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"brakes, struck a pose, smelt him very completely and turned away. It"
5711,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,was dismissal more ignominious than degradation at the head of one’s
5712,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,battalion. The representation was finished. Remained only for Apis to
5713,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,clear his stage of the subordinate characters.
5714,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5715,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“Ah! His gesture then! He gave a dramatic start--this Cyrano of the
5716,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,Camargue--as though he was aware of them for the first time. He moved.
5717,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,All their beautiful breeches twinkled for an instant along the top
5718,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"of the barrier. He held the stage alone! But Christophe and I, we"
5719,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"trembled! For, observe, he had now involved himself in a stupendous"
5720,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"drama of which he only could supply the third act. And, except for an"
5721,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"audience on the razor-edge of emotion, he had exhausted his material."
5722,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Molière himself--we have forgotten, my friend, to drink to the health"
5723,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,of that great soul--might have been at a loss. And Tragedy is but a
5724,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"step behind Failure. We could see the four or five Civil Guards, who"
5725,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"are sent always to keep order, fingering the breeches of their rifles."
5726,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"They were but waiting a word from the Mayor to fire on him, as they do"
5727,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,sometimes at a bull who leaps the barrier among the spectators. They
5728,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"would, of course, have killed or wounded several people--but that would"
5729,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,not have saved Apis.”
5730,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5731,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Monsieur Voiron drowned the thought at once, and wiped his beard."
5732,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5733,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"“At that moment Fate--the Genius of France, if you will--sent to"
5734,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"assist in the incomparable finale, none other than Chisto, the"
5735,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"eldest, and, I should have said (but never again will I judge!) the"
5736,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"least inspired of all; mediocrity itself but, at heart--and it is"
5737,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"the heart that conquers always, my friend--at heart an artist. He"
5738,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"descended stiffly into the arena, alone and assured. Apis regarded"
5739,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"him, his eyes in his eyes. The man took stance, with his cloak, and"
5740,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"called to the bull as to an equal: ‘Now, Señor, we will show these"
5741,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,honourable caballeros something together.’ He advanced thus against
5742,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"this thinker who at a plunge--a kick--a thrust--could, we all knew,"
5743,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"have extinguished him. My dear friend, I wish I could convey to you"
5744,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"something of the unaffected bonhomie, the humour, the delicacy, the"
5745,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"consideration bordering on respect even, with which Apis, the supreme"
5746,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"artist, responded to this invitation. It was the Master, wearied after"
5747,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"a strenuous hour in the atelier, unbuttoned and at ease with some"
5748,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,not inexpert but limited disciple. The telepathy was instantaneous
5749,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,between them. And for good reason! Christophe said to me: ‘All’s well.
5750,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,That Chisto began among the bulls. I was sure of it when I heard him
5751,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,call just now. He has been a herdsman. He’ll pull it off.’ There was
5752,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"a little feeling and adjustment, at first, for mutual distances and"
5753,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,allowances.
5754,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5755,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"“Oh, yes! And here occurred a gross impertinence of Villamarti. He had,"
5756,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"after an interval, followed Chisto--to retrieve his reputation. My"
5757,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,Faith! I can conceive the elder Dumas slamming his door on an intruder
5758,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,precisely as Apis did. He raced Villamarti into the nearest refuge at
5759,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"once. He stamped his feet outside it, and he snorted: ‘Go! I am engaged"
5760,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,with an artist.’ Villamarti went--his reputation left behind for ever.
5761,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,
5762,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,“Apis returned to Chisto saying: ‘Forgive the interruption. I am not
5763,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"always master of my time, but you were about to observe, my dear"
5764,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"confrère...?’ Then the play began. Out of compliment to Chisto, Apis"
5765,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,chose as his objective (every bull varies in this respect) the inner
5766,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,edge of the cloak--that nearest to the man’s body. This allows but a
5767,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,few millimetres clearance in charging. But Apis trusted himself as
5768,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Chisto trusted him, and, this time, he conformed to the man, with"
5769,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,inimitable judgment and temper. He allowed himself to be played into
5770,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"the shadow or the sun, as the delighted audience demanded. He raged"
5771,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"enormously; he feigned defeat; he despaired in statuesque abandon,"
5772,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,and thence flashed into fresh paroxysms of wrath--but always with the
5773,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,detachment of the true artist who knows he is but the vessel of an
5774,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"emotion whence others, not he, must drink. And never once did he forget"
5775,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,that honest Chisto’s cloak was to him the gauge by which to spare even
5776,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,a hair on the skin. He inspired Chisto too. My God! His youth returned
5777,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"to that meritorious beef-sticker--the desire, the grace, and the"
5778,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,beauty of his early dreams. One could almost see that girl of the past
5779,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"for whom he was rising, rising to these present heights of skill and"
5780,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,daring. It was his hour too--a miraculous hour of dawn returned to gild
5781,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,the sunset. All he knew was at Apis’ disposition. Apis acknowledged
5782,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"it with all that he had learned at home, at Arles and in his lonely"
5783,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,murders on our grazing-grounds. He flowed round Chisto like a river
5784,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"of death--round his knees, leaping at his shoulders, kicking just"
5785,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,clear of one side or the other of his head; behind his back hissing
5786,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,as he shaved by; and once or twice--inimitable!--he reared wholly up
5787,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,before him while Chisto slipped back from beneath the avalanche of that
5788,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"instructed body. Those two, my dear friend, held five thousand people"
5789,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,dumb with no sound but of their breathings--regular as pumps. It was
5790,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,unbearable. Beast and man realised together that we needed a change of
5791,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,note--a _détente_. They relaxed to pure buffoonery. Chisto fell back
5792,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,and talked to him outrageously. Apis pretended he had never heard such
5793,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,language. The audience howled with delight. Chisto slapped him; he
5794,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"took liberties with his short tail, to the end of which he clung while"
5795,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,Apis pirouetted; he played about him in all postures; he had become
5796,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"the herdsman again--gross, careless, brutal, but comprehending. Yet"
5797,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,Apis was always the more consummate clown. All that time (Christophe
5798,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,and I saw it) Apis drew off towards the gates of the _toril_ where so
5799,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,many bulls enter but--have you ever heard of one that returned? _We_
5800,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"knew that Apis knew that as he had saved Chisto, so Chisto would save"
5801,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,him. Life is sweet to us all; to the artist who lives many lives in
5802,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"one, sweetest. Chisto did not fail him. At the last, when none could"
5803,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"laugh any longer, the man threw his cape across the bull’s back, his"
5804,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"arm round his neck. He flung up a hand at the gate, as Villamarti,"
5805,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"young and commanding but _not_ a herdsman, might have raised it, and he"
5806,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"cried: ‘Gentlemen, open to me and my honourable little donkey.’ They"
5807,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,opened--I have misjudged Spaniards in my time!--those gates opened to
5808,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"the man and the bull together, and closed behind them. And then? From"
5809,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"the Mayor to the Guarda Civile they went mad for five minutes, till"
5810,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,the trumpets blew and the fifth bull rushed out--an unthinking black
5811,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"Andalusian. I suppose some one killed him. My friend, my very dear"
5812,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,"friend, to whom I have opened my heart, I confess that I did not watch."
5813,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,Christophe and I we were weeping together like children of the same
5814,THE BULL THAT THOUGHT,Mother. Shall we drink to Her?”

5953,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"(attached to Faith and Works E.C. 5837) in the years after the War, the"
5954,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,wonder is there was not more trouble from Brethren whom sudden meetings
5955,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"with old comrades jerked back into their still raw past. But our round,"
5956,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"torpedo-bearded local Doctor--Brother Keede, Senior Warden--always"
5957,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,stood ready to deal with hysteria before it got out of hand; and when
5958,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,I examined Brethren unknown or imperfectly vouched for on the Masonic
5959,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"side, I passed on to him anything that seemed doubtful. He had had his"
5960,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"experience as medical officer of a South London Battalion, during the"
5961,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"last two years of the War; and, naturally, often found friends and"
5962,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,acquaintances among the visitors.
5963,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
5964,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"Brother C. Strangwick, a young, tallish, new-made Brother, hailed"
5965,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,from some South London Lodge. His papers and his answers were above
5966,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"suspicion, but his red-rimmed eyes had a puzzled glare that might mean"
5967,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"nerves. So I introduced him particularly to Keede, who discovered in"
5968,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"him a Headquarters Orderly of his old Battalion, congratulated him on"
5969,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,his return to fitness--he had been discharged for some infirmity or
5970,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,other--and plunged at once into Somme memories.
5971,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
5972,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“I hope I did right, Keede,” I said when we were robing before Lodge."
5973,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
5974,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Oh, quite. He reminded me that I had him under my hands at Sampoux in"
5975,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"’Eighteen, when he went to bits. He was a Runner.”"
5976,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
5977,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Was it shock?” I asked.
5978,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
5979,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Of sorts--but not what he wanted me to think it was. No, he wasn’t"
5980,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,shamming. He had Jumps to the limit--but he played up to mislead me
5981,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"about the reason of ’em.... Well, if we could stop patients from lying,"
5982,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"medicine would be too easy, I suppose.”"
5983,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
5984,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"I noticed that, after Lodge-working, Keede gave him a seat a couple of"
5985,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"rows in front of us, that he might enjoy a lecture on the Orientation"
5986,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"of King Solomon’s Temple, which an earnest Brother thought would be"
5987,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,a nice interlude between labour and the high tea that we called our
5988,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Banquet.” Even helped by tobacco it was a dreary performance. About
5989,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"half-way through, Strangwick, who had been fidgeting and twitching"
5990,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"for some minutes, rose, drove back his chair grinding across the"
5991,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"tessellated floor, and yelped: “Oh, My Aunt! I can’t stand this any"
5992,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,longer.” Under cover of a general laugh of assent he brushed past us
5993,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,and stumbled towards the door.
5994,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
5995,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“I thought so!” Keede whispered to me. “Come along!” We overtook him in
5996,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"the passage, crowing hysterically and wringing his hands. Keede led him"
5997,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"into the Tyler’s Room, a small office where we stored odds and ends of"
5998,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"regalia and furniture, and locked the door."
5999,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6000,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“I’m--I’m all right,” the boy began, piteously."
6001,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6002,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“’Course you are.” Keede opened a small cupboard which I had seen
6003,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"called upon before, mixed sal volatile and water in a graduated glass,"
6004,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"and, as Strangwick drank, pushed him gently on to an old sofa. “There,”"
6005,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,he went on. “It’s nothing to write home about. I’ve seen you ten times
6006,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,worse. I expect our talk has brought things back.”
6007,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6008,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"He hooked up a chair behind him with one foot, held the patient’s hands"
6009,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"in his own, and sat down. The chair creaked."
6010,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6011,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Don’t!” Strangwick squealed. “I can’t stand it! There’s nothing on
6012,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,earth creaks like they do! And--and when it thaws we--we’ve got to slap
6013,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,’em back with a spa-ade! ’Remember those Frenchmen’s little boots under
6014,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,the duck-boards?... What’ll I do? What’ll I do about it?”
6015,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6016,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"Some one knocked at the door, to know if all were well."
6017,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6018,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Oh, quite, thanks!” said Keede over his shoulder. “But I shall need"
6019,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"this room awhile. Draw the curtains, please.”"
6020,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6021,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,We heard the rings of the hangings that drape the passage from Lodge to
6022,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"Banquet Room click along their poles, and what sound there had been, of"
6023,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"feet and voices, was shut off."
6024,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6025,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"Strangwick, retching impotently, complained of the frozen dead who"
6026,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,creak in the frost.
6027,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6028,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“He’s playing up still,” Keede whispered. “_That’s_ not his real"
6029,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,trouble--any more than ’twas last time.”
6030,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6031,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“But surely,” I replied, “men get those things on the brain pretty"
6032,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,badly. ’Remember in October----”
6033,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6034,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“This chap hasn’t, though. I wonder what’s really helling him. What are"
6035,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,you thinking of?” said Keede peremptorily.
6036,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6037,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“French End an’ Butcher’s Row,” Strangwick muttered."
6038,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6039,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Yes, there were a few there. But, suppose we face Bogey instead of"
6040,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,giving him best every time.” Keede turned towards me with a hint in his
6041,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,eye that I was to play up to his leads.
6042,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6043,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“What was the trouble with French End?” I opened at a venture.
6044,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6045,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“It was a bit by Sampoux, that we had taken over from the French."
6046,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"They’re tough, but you wouldn’t call ’em tidy as a nation. They"
6047,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,had faced both sides of it with dead to keep the mud back. All
6048,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,those trenches were like gruel in a thaw. Our people had to do the
6049,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,same sort of thing--elsewhere; but Butcher’s Row in French End was
6050,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"the--er--show-piece. Luckily, we pinched a salient from Jerry just"
6051,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"then, an’ straightened things out--so we didn’t need to use the Row"
6052,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"after November. You remember, Strangwick?”"
6053,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6054,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“My God, yes! When the duckboard-slats were missin’ you’d tread on ’em,"
6055,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,an’ they’d creak.”
6056,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6057,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“They’re bound to. Like leather,” said Keede. “It gets on one’s nerves"
6058,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"a bit, but----”"
6059,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6060,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Nerves? It’s real! It’s real!” Strangwick gulped.
6061,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6062,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“But at your time of life, it’ll all fall behind you in a year or so."
6063,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"I’ll give you another sip of--paregoric, an’ we’ll face it quietly."
6064,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,Shall we?”
6065,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6066,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,Keede opened his cupboard again and administered a carefully dropped
6067,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,dark dose of something that was not sal volatile. “This’ll settle you
6068,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"in a few minutes,” he explained. “Lie still, an’ don’t talk unless you"
6069,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,feel like it.”
6070,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6071,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"He faced me, fingering his beard."
6072,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6073,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Ye-es. Butcher’s Row wasn’t pretty,” he volunteered. “Seeing"
6074,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"Strangwick here, has brought it all back to me again. ’Funny thing! We"
6075,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,had a Platoon Sergeant of Number Two--what the deuce was his name?--an
6076,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,elderly bird who must have lied like a patriot to get out to the front
6077,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"at his age; but he was a first-class Non-Com., and the last person,"
6078,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"you’d think, to make mistakes. Well, he was due for a fortnight’s home"
6079,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"leave in January ’Eighteen. You were at B. H. Q. then, Strangwick,"
6080,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,weren’t you?”
6081,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6082,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Yes. I was Orderly. It was January twenty-first”; Strangwick spoke
6083,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"with a thickish tongue, and his eyes burned. Whatever drug it was, had"
6084,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,taken hold.
6085,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6086,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“About then,” Keede said. “Well, this Sergeant, instead of coming down"
6087,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,from the trenches the regular way an’ joinin’ Battalion Details after
6088,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"dark, an’ takin’ that funny little train for Arras, thinks he’ll warm"
6089,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"himself first. So he gets into a dug-out, in Butcher’s Row, that used"
6090,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"to be an old French dressing-station, and fugs up between a couple"
6091,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"of braziers of pure charcoal! As luck ’ud have it, that was the only"
6092,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,dug-out with an inside door opening inwards--some French anti-gas
6093,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"fitting, I expect--and, by what we could make out, the door must"
6094,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"have swung to while he was warming. Anyhow, he didn’t turn up at the"
6095,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,train. There was a search at once. We couldn’t afford to waste Platoon
6096,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,Sergeants. We found him in the morning. He’d got his gas all right. A
6097,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"machine-gunner reported him, didn’t he, Strangwick?”"
6098,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6099,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“No, sir. Corporal Grant--o’ the Trench Mortars.”"
6100,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6101,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“So it was. Yes, Grant--the man with that little wen on his neck."
6102,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"’Nothing wrong with your memory, at any rate. What was the Sergeant’s"
6103,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,name?”
6104,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6105,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Godsoe--John Godsoe,” Strangwick answered."
6106,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6107,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Yes, that was it. I had to see him next mornin’--frozen stiff between"
6108,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,the two braziers--and not a scrap of private papers on him. _That_ was
6109,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,the only thing that made me think it mightn’t have been--quite an
6110,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,accident.”
6111,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6112,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"Strangwick’s relaxing face set, and he threw back at once to the"
6113,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,Orderly Room manner.
6114,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6115,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“I give my evidence--at the time--to you, sir. He passed--overtook me,"
6116,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"I should say--comin’ down from supports, after I’d warned him for leaf."
6117,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,I thought he was goin’ through Parrot Trench as usual; but ’e must ’ave
6118,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,turned off into French End where the old bombed barricade was.”
6119,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6120,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Yes. I remember now. You were the last man to see him alive. That
6121,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"was on the twenty-first of January, you say? Now, _when_ was it that"
6122,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,Dearlove and Billings brought you to me--clean out of your head?...
6123,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"Keede dropped his hand, in the style of magazine detectives, on"
6124,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"Strangwick’s shoulder. The boy looked at him with cloudy wonder, and"
6125,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,muttered: “I was took to you on the evenin’ of the twenty-fourth of
6126,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"January. But you don’t think I did him in, do you?”"
6127,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6128,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,I could not help smiling at Keede’s discomfiture; but he recovered
6129,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,himself. “Then what the dickens _was_ on your mind that evening--before
6130,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,I gave you the hypodermic?”
6131,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6132,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“The--the things in Butcher’s Row. They kept on comin’ over me. You’ve
6133,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"seen me like this before, sir.”"
6134,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6135,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“But I knew that it was a lie. You’d no more got stiffs on the brain
6136,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"then, than you have now. You’ve got something, but you’re hiding it.”"
6137,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6138,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“’Ow do _you_ know, Doctor?” Strangwick whimpered."
6139,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6140,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“D’you remember what you said to me, when Dearlove and Billings were"
6141,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,holding you down that evening?”
6142,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6143,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“About the things in Butcher’s Row?”
6144,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6145,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Oh, no! You spun me a lot of stuff about corpses creaking; but you"
6146,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,let yourself go in the middle of it--when you pushed that telegram at
6147,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"me. What did you mean, f’rinstance, by asking what advantage it was for"
6148,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,you to fight beasts of officers if the dead didn’t rise?”
6149,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6150,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Did I say ‘Beasts of Officers’?”
6151,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6152,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“You did. It’s out of the Burial Service.”
6153,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6154,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“I suppose, then, I must have heard it. As a matter of fact, I ’ave.”"
6155,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,Strangwick shuddered extravagantly.
6156,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6157,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Probably. And there’s another thing--that hymn you were shouting till
6158,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,I put you under. It was something about Mercy and Love. ’Remember it?”
6159,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6160,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“I’ll try,” said the boy obediently, and began to paraphrase, as nearly"
6161,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"as possible thus: “‘Whatever a man may say in his heart unto the Lord,"
6162,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"yea verily I say unto you--Gawd hath shown man, again and again,"
6163,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,marvellous mercy an’--an’ somethin’ or other love.’” He screwed up his
6164,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,eyes and shook.
6165,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6166,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Now where did you get _that_ from?” Keede insisted.
6167,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6168,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“From Godsoe--on the twenty-first Jan.... ’Ow could _I_ tell what ’e
6169,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"meant to do?” he burst out in a high, unnatural key--“Any more than I"
6170,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,knew _she_ was dead.”
6171,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6172,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Who was dead?” said Keede.
6173,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6174,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Me Auntie Armine.”
6175,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6176,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“The one the telegram came to you about, at Sampoux, that you wanted me"
6177,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,to explain--the one that you were talking of in the passage out here
6178,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"just now when you began: ‘O Auntie,’ and changed it to ‘O Gawd,’ when I"
6179,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,collared you?”
6180,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6181,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“That’s her! I haven’t a chance with you, Doctor. _I_ didn’t know there"
6182,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,was anything wrong with those braziers. How could I? We’re always usin’
6183,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"’em. Honest to God, I thought at first go-off he might wish to warm"
6184,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,himself before the leaf-train. I--I didn’t know Uncle John meant to
6185,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"start--’ouse-keepin’.” He laughed horribly, and then the dry tears came."
6186,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6187,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,Keede waited for them to pass in sobs and hiccoughs before he
6188,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"continued, “Why? Was Godsoe your Uncle?”"
6189,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6190,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“No,” said Strangwick, his head between his hands. “Only we’d known him"
6191,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,ever since we were born. Dad ’ad known him before that. He lived almost
6192,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,next street to us. Him an’ Dad an’ Ma an’--an’ the rest had always been
6193,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,friends. So we called him Uncle--like children do.”
6194,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6195,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“What sort of man was he?”
6196,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6197,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“One o’ _the_ best, sir. ’Pensioned Sergeant with a little money left"
6198,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,him--quite independent--and very superior. They had a sittin’-room full
6199,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,o’ Indian curios that him and his wife used to let sister an’ me see
6200,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,when we’d been good.”
6201,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6202,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Wasn’t he rather old to join up?”
6203,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6204,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“That made no odds to him. He joined up as Sergeant Instructor at
6205,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"the first go-off, an’ when the Battalion was ready he got ’imself"
6206,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,sent along. He wangled me into ’is Platoon when I went out--early in
6207,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"’Seventeen. Because Ma wanted it, I suppose.”"
6208,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6209,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“I’d no notion you knew him that well,” was Keede’s comment."
6210,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6211,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Oh, it made no odds to him. He ’ad no pets in the Platoon, but ’e’d"
6212,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"write ’ome to Ma about me an’ all the doin’s. You see,” Strangwick"
6213,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"stirred uneasily on the sofa, “we’d known him all our lives--lived in"
6214,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,the next street an’ all.... An’ him well over fifty. Oh dear me! _Oh_
6215,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"dear me! What a bloody mix-up things are, when one’s as young as me!”"
6216,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,he wailed of a sudden.
6217,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6218,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,But Keede held him to the point. “He wrote to your Mother about you?”
6219,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6220,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Yes. Ma’s eyes had gone bad followin’ on air-raids. ’Blood-vessels
6221,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,broke behind ’em from sittin’ in cellars an’ bein’ sick. She had to
6222,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"’ave ’er letters read to her by Auntie. Now I think of it, that was the"
6223,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,only thing that you might have called anything at all----”
6224,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6225,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Was that the Aunt that died, and that you got the wire about?” Keede"
6226,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,drove on.
6227,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6228,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Yes--Auntie Armine--Ma’s younger sister an’ she nearer fifty than
6229,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"forty. What a mix-up! An’ if I’d been asked any time about it, I’d"
6230,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,’ave sworn there wasn’t a single sol’tary item concernin’ her that
6231,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,everybody didn’t know an’ hadn’t known all along. No more conceal to
6232,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,her doin’s than--than so much shop-front. She’d looked after sister an’
6233,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"me, when needful--hoopin’ cough an’ measles--just the same as Ma. We"
6234,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"was in an’ out of her house like rabbits. You see, Uncle Armine is a"
6235,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"cabinet-maker, an’ second-’and furniture, an’ we liked playin’ with the"
6236,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"things. She ’ad no children, and when the War came, she said she was"
6237,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,glad of it. But she never talked much of her feelin’s. She kept herself
6238,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"to herself, you understand.” He stared most earnestly at us to help out"
6239,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,our understandings.
6240,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6241,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“What was she like?” Keede inquired.
6242,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6243,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“A biggish woman, an’ had been ’andsome, I believe, but, bein’ used"
6244,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"to her, we two didn’t notice much--except, per’aps, for one thing. Ma"
6245,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"called her ’er proper name, which was Bella; but Sis an’ me always"
6246,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,called ’er Auntie Armine. See?”
6247,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6248,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“What for?”
6249,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6250,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“We thought it sounded more like her--like somethin’ movin’ slow, in"
6251,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,armour.”
6252,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6253,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Oh! And she read your letters to your mother, did she?”"
6254,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6255,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Every time the post came in she’d slip across the road from opposite
6256,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,an’ read ’em. An’--an’ I’ll go bail for it that that was all there was
6257,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"to it for as far back as _I_ remember. Was I to swing to-morrow, I’d"
6258,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"go bail for _that!_ ’Tisn’t fair of ’em to ’ave unloaded it all on me,"
6259,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"because--because--if the dead _do_ rise, why, what in ’ell becomes of"
6260,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,me an’ all I’ve believed all me life? I want to know _that_! I--I----”
6261,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6262,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,But Keede would not be put off. “Did the Sergeant give you away at all
6263,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"in his letters?” he demanded, very quietly."
6264,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6265,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“There was nothin’ to give away--we was too busy--but his letters about
6266,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,me were a great comfort to Ma. I’m no good at writin’. I saved it
6267,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,all up for my leafs. I got me fourteen days every six months an’ one
6268,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"over.... I was luckier than most, that way.”"
6269,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6270,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“And when you came home, used you to bring ’em news about the"
6271,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,Sergeant?” said Keede.
6272,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6273,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“I expect I must have; but I didn’t think much of it at the time. I
6274,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,was took up with me own affairs--naturally. Uncle John always wrote to
6275,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"me once each leaf, tellin’ me what was doin’ an’ what I was li’ble to"
6276,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"expect on return, an’ Ma ’ud ’ave that read to her. Then o’ course I"
6277,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,had to slip over to his wife an’ pass her the news. An’ then there was
6278,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,the young lady that I’d thought of marryin’ if I came through. We’d got
6279,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,as far as pricin’ things in the windows together.”
6280,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6281,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“And you didn’t marry her--after all?”
6282,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6283,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"Another tremor shook the boy. “_No!_” he cried. “’Fore it ended, I knew"
6284,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,what reel things reelly mean! I--I never dreamed such things could
6285,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,be!... An’ she nearer fifty than forty an’ me own Aunt!... But there
6286,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"wasn’t a sign nor a hint from first to last, so ’ow _could_ I tell?"
6287,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"Don’t you _see_ it? All she said to me after me Christmas leaf in ’18,"
6288,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,when I come to say good-bye--all Auntie Armine said to me was: ‘You’ll
6289,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"be seein’ Mister Godsoe soon?’ ‘Too soon for my likings,’ I says. ‘Well"
6290,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"then, tell ’im from me,’ she says, ‘that I expect to be through with my"
6291,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"little trouble by the twenty-first of next month, an’ I’m dyin’ to see"
6292,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,him as soon as possible after that date.’”
6293,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6294,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“What sort of trouble was it?” Keede turned professional at once.
6295,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6296,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“She’d ’ad a bit of a gatherin’ in ’er breast, I believe. But she never"
6297,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,talked of ’er body much to any one.”
6298,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6299,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“_I_ see,” said Keede. “And she said to you?”"
6300,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6301,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,Strangwick repeated: “‘Tell Uncle John I hope to be finished of my
6302,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"drawback by the twenty-first, an’ I’m dying to see ’im as soon as ’e"
6303,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"can after that date.’ An’ then she says, laughin’: ‘But you’ve a head"
6304,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"like a sieve. I’ll write it down, an’ you can give it him when you see"
6305,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,’im.’ So she wrote it on a bit o’ paper an’ I kissed ’er good-bye--I
6306,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"was always her favourite, you see--an’ I went back to Sampoux. The"
6307,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"thing hardly stayed in my mind at all, d’you see. But the next time I"
6308,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"was up in the front line--I was a Runner, d’ye see--our platoon was"
6309,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,in North Bay Trench an’ I was up with a message to the Trench Mortar
6310,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,there that Corporal Grant was in charge of. Followin’ on receipt of
6311,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"it, he borrowed a couple of men off the platoon, to slue ’er round or"
6312,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"somethin’. I give Uncle John Auntie Armine’s paper, an’ I give Grant"
6313,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"a fag, an’ we warmed up a bit over a brazier. Then Grant says to me:"
6314,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,‘I don’t like it’; an’ he jerks ’is thumb at Uncle John in the bay
6315,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"studyin’ Auntie’s message. Well, _you_ know, sir, you had to speak to"
6316,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,Grant about ’is way of prophesyin’ things--after Rankine shot himself
6317,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,with the Very light.”
6318,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6319,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“I did,” said Keede, and he explained to me: “Grant had the Second"
6320,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,Sight--confound him! It upset the men. I was glad when he got pipped.
6321,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"What happened after that, Strangwick?”"
6322,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6323,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Grant whispers to me: ‘Look, you damned Englishman. ’E’s for it.’"
6324,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"Uncle John was leanin’ up against the bay, an’ hummin’ that hymn I was"
6325,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,tryin’ to tell you just now. He looked different all of a sudden--as
6326,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"if ’e’d got shaved. _I_ don’t know anything of these things, but I"
6327,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"cautioned Grant as to his style of speakin’, if an officer ’ad ’eard"
6328,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"him, an’ I went on. Passin’ Uncle John in the bay,’e nods an’ smiles,"
6329,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"which he didn’t often, an’ he says, pocketin’ the paper: ‘This suits"
6330,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"_me_. I’m for leaf on the twenty-first, too.’”"
6331,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6332,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“He said that to you, did he?” said Keede."
6333,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6334,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“_Pre_cisely the same as passin’ the time o’ day. O’ course I returned
6335,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"the agreeable about hopin’ he’d get it, an’ in due course, I returned"
6336,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,to ’Eadquarters. The thing ’ardly stayed in my mind a minute. That was
6337,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,the eleventh January--three days after I’d come back from leaf. You
6338,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"remember, sir, there wasn’t anythin’ doin’ either side round Sampoux"
6339,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,the first part o’ the month. Jerry was gettin’ ready for his March
6340,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"Push, an’ as long as he kept quiet, we didn’t want to poke ’im up.”"
6341,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6342,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“I remember that,” said Keede. “But what about the Sergeant?”"
6343,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6344,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“I must have met him, on an’ off, I expect, goin’ up an’ down, through"
6345,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"the ensuin’ days, but it didn’t stay in me mind. Why needed it? And on"
6346,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"the twenty-first Jan., his name was on the leaf-paper when I went up to"
6347,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"warn the leaf-men. I noticed _that_, o’ course. Now that very afternoon"
6348,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"Jerry ’ad been tryin’ a new trench-mortar, an’ before our ’Eavies could"
6349,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"out it, he’d got a stinker into a bay an’ mopped up ’alf a dozen."
6350,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"They were bringin’ ’em down when I went up to the supports, an’ that"
6351,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"blocked Little Parrot, same as it always did. _You_ remember, sir?”"
6352,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6353,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Rather! And there was that big machine-gun behind the Half-House
6354,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"waiting for you if you got out,” said Keede."
6355,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6356,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“I remembered that too. But it was just on dark an’ the fog was comin’
6357,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"off the Canal, so I hopped out of Little Parrot an’ cut across the"
6358,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,open to where those four dead Warwicks are heaped up. But the fog
6359,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"turned me round, an’ the next thing I knew I was knee-over in that old"
6360,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,’alf-trench that runs west o’ Little Parrot into French End. I dropped
6361,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,into it--almost atop o’ the machine-gun platform by the side o’ the old
6362,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"sugar boiler an’ the two Zoo-ave skel’tons. That gave me my bearin’s,"
6363,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"an’ so I went through French End, all up those missin’ duckboards, into"
6364,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"Butcher’s Row where the _poy-looz_ was laid in six deep each side, an’"
6365,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"stuffed under the duckboards. It had froze tight, an’ the drippin’s had"
6366,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"stopped, an’ the creakin’s had begun.”"
6367,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6368,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Did that really worry you at the time?” Keede asked.
6369,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6370,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“No,” said the boy with professional scorn. “If a Runner starts"
6371,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"noticin’ such things he’d better chuck. In the middle of the Row, just"
6372,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"before the old dressin’-station you referred to, sir, it come over me"
6373,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"that somethin’ ahead on the duckboards was just like Auntie Armine,"
6374,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,waitin’ beside the door; an’ I thought to meself ’ow truly comic it
6375,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,would be if she could be dumped where I was then. In ’alf a second I
6376,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"saw it was only the dark an’ some rags o’ gas-screen, ’angin’ on a bit"
6377,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"of board, ’ad played me the trick. So I went on up to the supports an’"
6378,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"warned the leaf-men there, includin’ Uncle John. Then I went up Rake"
6379,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,Alley to warn ’em in the front line. I didn’t hurry because I didn’t
6380,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"want to get there till Jerry ’ad quieted down a bit. Well, then a"
6381,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,Company Relief dropped in--an’ the officer got the wind up over some
6382,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"lights on the flank, an’ tied ’em into knots, an’ I ’ad to hunt up me"
6383,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"leaf-men all over the blinkin’ shop. What with one thing an’ another,"
6384,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,it must ’ave been ’alf-past eight before I got back to the supports.
6385,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"There I run across Uncle John, scrapin’ mud off himself, havin’"
6386,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"shaved--quite the dandy. He asked about the Arras train, an’ I said,"
6387,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"if Jerry was quiet, it might be ten o’clock. ‘Good!’ says ’e. ‘I’ll"
6388,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,come with you.’ So we started back down the old trench that used to run
6389,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"across Halnaker, back of the support dug-outs. _You_ know, sir.”"
6390,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6391,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,Keede nodded.
6392,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6393,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Then Uncle John says something to me about seein’ Ma an’ the rest of
6394,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"’em in a few days, an’ had I any messages for ’em? Gawd knows what made"
6395,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"me do it, but I told ’im to tell Auntie Armine I never expected to see"
6396,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,anything like _her_ up in our part of the world. And while I told him
6397,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,I laughed. That’s the last time I _’ave_ laughed. ‘Oh--you’ve seen
6398,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"’er, ’ave you?’ says he, quite natural-like. Then I told ’im about the"
6399,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"sand-bags an’ rags in the dark, playin’ the trick. ‘Very likely,’ says"
6400,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"he, brushin’ the mud off his puttees. By this time, we’d got to the"
6401,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,corner where the old barricade into French End was--before they bombed
6402,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"it down, sir. He turns right an’ climbs across it. ‘No thanks,’ says I."
6403,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,‘I’ve been there once this evenin’.’ But he wasn’t attendin’ to me. He
6404,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"felt behind the rubbish an’ bones just inside the barricade, an’ when"
6405,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"he straightened up, he had a full brazier in each hand."
6406,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6407,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“‘Come on, Clem,’ he says, an’ he very rarely give me me own name. ‘You"
6408,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"aren’t afraid, are you?’ he says. ‘It’s just as short, an’ if Jerry"
6409,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,starts up again he won’t waste stuff here. He knows it’s abandoned.’
6410,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"‘Who’s afraid now?’ I says. ‘Me for one,’ says he. ‘I don’t want _my_"
6411,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,leaf spoiled at the last minute.’ Then ’e wheels round an’ speaks that
6412,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,bit you said come out o’ the Burial Service.”
6413,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6414,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"For some reason Keede repeated it in full, slowly: “If, after the"
6415,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"manner of men, I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth"
6416,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,it me if the dead rise not?”
6417,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6418,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“That’s it,” said Strangwick. “So we went down French End"
6419,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"together--everything froze up an’ quiet, except for their creakin’s. I"
6420,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,remember thinkin’----” his eyes began to flicker.
6421,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6422,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Don’t think. Tell what happened,” Keede ordered."
6423,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6424,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Oh! Beg y’ pardon! He went on with his braziers, hummin’ his hymn,"
6425,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,down Butcher’s Row. Just before we got to the old dressin’-station he
6426,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"stops and sets ’em down an’ says: ‘Where did you say she was, Clem? Me"
6427,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,eyes ain’t as good as they used to be.’
6428,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6429,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“‘In ’er bed at ’ome,’ I says. ‘Come on down. It’s perishin’ cold, an’"
6430,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,_I’m_ not due for leaf.’
6431,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6432,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“‘Well, I am,’ ’e says. ‘_I_ am....’ An’ then--’give you me word I"
6433,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,didn’t recognise the voice--he stretches out ’is neck a bit in a way
6434,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"’e ’ad, an’ he says: ‘Why, Bella!’ ’e says. ‘Oh, Bella!’ ’e says."
6435,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,‘Thank Gawd!’ ’e says. Just like that! An’ then I saw--I tell you I
6436,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,_saw_--Auntie Armine herself standin’ by the old dressin’-station
6437,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,door where first I’d thought I’d seen her. He was lookin’ at ’er an’
6438,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"she was lookin’ at him. I saw it, an’ me soul turned over inside me"
6439,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,because--because it knocked out everything I’d believed in. I ’ad
6440,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"nothin’ to lay ’old of, d’ye see? An’ ’e was lookin’ at ’er as though"
6441,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"he could ’ave et ’er, an’ she was lookin’ at ’im the same way, out of"
6442,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"’er eyes. Then he says: ‘Why, Bella,’ ’e says, ‘this must be only"
6443,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,the second time we’ve been alone together in all these years.’ An’ I
6444,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,saw ’er half hold out her arms to ’im in that perishin’ cold. An’ she
6445,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,nearer fifty than forty an’ me own Aunt! You can shop me for a lunatic
6446,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"to-morrow, but I saw it--I _saw_ ’er answerin’ to his spoken word!..."
6447,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,Then ’e made a snatch to unsling ’is rifle. Then ’e cuts ’is hand away
6448,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"saying: ‘No! Don’t tempt me, Bella. We’ve all Eternity ahead of us. An"
6449,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,hour or two won’t make any odds.’ Then he picks up the braziers an’
6450,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,goes on to the dug-out door. He’d finished with me. He pours petrol
6451,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"on ’em, an’ lights it with a match, an’ carries ’em inside, flarin’."
6452,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,All that time Auntie Armine stood with ’er arms out--an’ a look in ’er
6453,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,face! _I_ didn’t know such things was or could be! Then he comes out
6454,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"an’ says: ‘Come in, my dear’; an’ she stoops an’ goes into the dug-out"
6455,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,with that look on her face--that look on her face! An’ then ’e shuts
6456,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"the door from inside an’ starts wedgin’ it up. So ’elp me Gawd, I saw"
6457,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,an’ ’eard all these things with my own eyes an’ ears!”
6458,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6459,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,He repeated his oath several times. After a long pause Keede asked him
6460,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,if he recalled what happened next.
6461,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6462,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“It was a bit of a mix-up, for me, from then on. I must have carried"
6463,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"on--they told me I did, but--but I was--I felt a--a long way inside of"
6464,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"meself, like--if you’ve ever had that feelin’. I wasn’t rightly on the"
6465,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"spot at all. They woke me up sometime next morning, because ’e ’adn’t"
6466,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,showed up at the train; an’ some one had seen him with me. I wasn’t
6467,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,’alf cross-examined by all an’ sundry till dinner-time.
6468,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6469,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Then, I think, I volunteered for Dearlove, who ’ad a sore toe, for a"
6470,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"front-line message. I had to keep movin’, you see, because I hadn’t"
6471,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"anything to hold _on_ to. Whilst up there, Grant informed me how he’d"
6472,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,found Uncle John with the door wedged an’ sand-bags stuffed in the
6473,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,cracks. I hadn’t waited for that. The knockin’ when ’e wedged up was
6474,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,enough for me. ’Like Dad’s coffin.”
6475,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6476,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“No one told _me_ the door had been wedged,” Keede spoke severely."
6477,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6478,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“No need to black a dead man’s name, sir.”"
6479,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6480,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“What made Grant go to Butcher’s Row?”
6481,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6482,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Because he’d noticed Uncle John had been pinchin’ charcoal for a week
6483,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,past an’ layin’ it up behind the old barricade there. So when the ’unt
6484,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"began, he went that way straight as a string, an’ when he saw the door"
6485,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"shut, he knew. He told me he picked the sand-bags out of the cracks"
6486,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,an’ shoved ’is hand through and shifted the wedges before any one come
6487,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"along. It looked all right. You said yourself, sir, the door must ’ave"
6488,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,blown to.”
6489,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6490,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Grant knew what Godsoe meant, then?” Keede snapped."
6491,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6492,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Grant knew Godsoe was for it; an’ nothin’ earthly could ’elp or
6493,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,’inder. He told me so.”
6494,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6495,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“And then what did you do?”
6496,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6497,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“I expect I must ’ave kept on carryin’ on, till Headquarters give me"
6498,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,that wire from Ma--about Auntie Armine dyin’.”
6499,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6500,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“When had your Aunt died?”
6501,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6502,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“On the mornin’ of the twenty-first. The mornin’ of the 21st! That tore
6503,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"it, d’ye see? As long as I could think, I had kep’ tellin’ myself it"
6504,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,was like those things you lectured about at Arras when we was billeted
6505,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"in the cellars--the Angels of Mons, and so on. But that wire tore it.”"
6506,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6507,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Oh! Hallucinations! I remember. And that wire tore it?” said Keede.
6508,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6509,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Yes! You see”--he half lifted himself off the sofa--“there wasn’t a
6510,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"single gor-dam thing left abidin’ for me to take hold of, here or"
6511,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,hereafter. If the dead _do_ rise and I saw ’em--why--why _anything_ can
6512,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,’appen. Don’t you understand?”
6513,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6514,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"He was on his feet now, gesticulating stiffly."
6515,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6516,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“For I saw ’er,” he repeated. “I saw ’im an’ ’er--she dead since"
6517,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"mornin’ time, an’ he killin’ ’imself before my livin’ eyes so’s to"
6518,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,carry on with ’er for all Eternity--an’ she ’oldin’ out ’er arms for
6519,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"it! I want to know where I’m _at_! Look ’ere, you two--why stand _we_"
6520,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,in jeopardy every hour?”
6521,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6522,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“God knows,” said Keede to himself."
6523,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6524,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Hadn’t we better ring for some one?” I suggested. “He’ll go off the
6525,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,handle in a second.”
6526,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6527,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“No he won’t. It’s the last kick-up before it takes hold. I know how
6528,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,the stuff works. Hul-lo.”
6529,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6530,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"Strangwick, his hands behind his back and his eyes set, gave tongue in"
6531,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"the strained, cracked voice of a boy reciting. “Not twice in the world"
6532,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"shall the Gods do thus,” he cried again and again."
6533,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6534,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“And I’m damned if it’s goin’ to be even once for me!” he went on with
6535,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,sudden insane fury. “_I_ don’t care whether we _’ave_ been pricin’
6536,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,things in the windows.... _Let_ ’er sue if she likes! She don’t know
6537,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,what reel things mean. _I_ do--I’ve ’ad occasion to notice ’em....
6538,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"_No_, I tell you! I’ll ’ave ’em when I want ’em, an’ be done with ’em;"
6539,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,but not till I see that look on a face ... that look.... I’m not takin’
6540,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"any. The reel thing’s life an’ death. It _begins_ at death, d’ye see."
6541,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"_She_ can’t understand.... Oh, go on an’ push off to Hell, you an’ your"
6542,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,lawyers. I’m fed up with it--fed up!”
6543,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6544,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"He stopped as abruptly as he had started, and the drawn face broke back"
6545,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"to its natural irresolute lines. Keede, holding both his hands, led him"
6546,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"back to the sofa, where he dropped like a wet towel, took out some"
6547,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"flamboyant robe from a press, and drew it neatly over him."
6548,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6549,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Ye-es. _That’s_ the real thing at last,” said Keede. “Now he’s got it"
6550,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"off his mind he’ll sleep. By the way, who introduced him?”"
6551,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6552,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Shall I go and find out?” I suggested.
6553,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6554,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“Yes; and you might ask him to come here. There’s no need for us to
6555,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,stand to all night.”
6556,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6557,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"So I went to the Banquet which was in full swing, and was seized by an"
6558,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"elderly, precise Brother from a South London Lodge who followed me,"
6559,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,concerned and apologetic. Keede soon put him at his ease.
6560,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6561,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“The boy’s had trouble,” our visitor explained. “I’m most mortified he"
6562,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,should have performed his bad turn here. I thought he’d put it be’ind
6563,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,him.”
6564,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6565,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“I expect talking about old days with me brought it all back,” said"
6566,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,Keede. “It does sometimes.”
6567,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6568,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Maybe! Maybe! But over and above that, Clem’s had post-war trouble,"
6569,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,too.”
6570,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6571,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Can’t he get a job? He oughtn’t to let that weigh on him, at his time"
6572,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"of life,” said Keede cheerily."
6573,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6574,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“’Tisn’t that--he’s provided for--but”--he coughed confidentially
6575,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"behind his dry hand--“as a matter of fact, Worshipful Sir, he’s--he’s"
6576,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,implicated for the present in a little breach of promise action.”
6577,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6578,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Ah! That’s a different thing,” said Keede."
6579,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6580,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Yes. That’s his reel trouble. No reason given, you understand. The"
6581,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"young lady in every way suitable, an’ she’d make him a good little wife"
6582,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"too, if I’m any judge. But he says she ain’t his ideel or something."
6583,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"’No getting at what’s in young people’s minds these days, is there?”"
6584,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6585,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“I’m afraid there isn’t,” said Keede. “But he’s all right now. He’ll"
6586,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"sleep. You sit by him, and when he wakes, take him home quietly...."
6587,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"Oh, we’re used to men getting a little upset here. You’ve nothing to"
6588,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"thank us for, Brother--Brother----”"
6589,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6590,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"“Armine,” said the old gentleman. “He’s my nephew by marriage.”"
6591,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6592,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,“That’s all that’s wanted!” said Keede.
6593,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,
6594,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,Brother Armine looked a little puzzled. Keede hastened to explain. “As
6595,A MADONNA OF THE TRENCHES,"I was saying, all he wants now is to be kept quiet till he wakes.”"

6844,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6845,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"The Army Class “English,” which included the Upper Fifth, was trying"
6846,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,to keep awake; for “English” (Literature--Augustan epoch--eighteenth
6847,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"century) came at last lesson, and that, on a blazing July afternoon,"
6848,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,meant after every one had been bathing. Even Mr. King found it hard to
6849,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"fight against the snore of the tide along the Pebble Ridge, and spurred"
6850,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,himself with strong words.
6851,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6852,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Since, said he, the pearls of English Literature existed only to be"
6853,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,wrenched from their settings and cast before young swine rooting
6854,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"for marks, it was his loathed business--in anticipation of the Army"
6855,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Preliminary Examination which, as usual, would be held at the term’s"
6856,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"end, under the auspices of an official examiner sent down _ad hoc_--to"
6857,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"prepare for the Form a General Knowledge test-paper, which he would"
6858,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,give them next week. It would cover their studies up to date of the
6859,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Augustans and _King Lear_, which was the selected--and strictly"
6860,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"expurgated--Army Exam. play for that year. Now, English Literature,"
6861,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"as he might have told them, was _not_ divided into water-tight"
6862,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"compartments, but flowed like a river. For example, Samuel Johnson,"
6863,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"glory of the Augustans and no mean commentator of Shakespeare, was but"
6864,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,one in a mighty procession which----
6865,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6866,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,At this point Beetle’s nodding brows came down with a grunt on the
6867,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,desk. He had been soaking and sunning himself in the open sea-baths
6868,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"built out on the rocks under the cliffs, from two-fifteen to four-forty."
6869,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6870,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"The Army Class took Johnson off their minds. With any luck, Beetle"
6871,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,would last King till the tea-bell. King rubbed his hands and began to
6872,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,carve him. He had gone to sleep to show his contempt (_a_) for Mr.
6873,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"King, who might or might not matter, and (_b_) for the Augustans,"
6874,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"who, none the less, were not to be sneered at by one whose vast and"
6875,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"omnivorous reading, for which such extraordinary facilities had been"
6876,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,granted (this was because the Head had allowed Beetle the run of his
6877,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"library), naturally overlooked such _epigonoi_ as Johnson, Swift,"
6878,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Pope, Addison, and the like. Harrison Ainsworth and Marryat doubtless"
6879,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,appealed----
6880,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6881,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Even so, Beetle, salt-encrusted all over except his spectacles and"
6882,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"steeped in delicious languors, was sliding back to sleep again, when"
6883,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Taffy” Howell, the leading light of the Form, who knew his Marryat as"
6884,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"well as Stalky did his Surtees, began in his patent, noiseless whisper:"
6885,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“‘Allow me to observe--in the most delicate manner in the world--just
6886,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,to hint----’”
6887,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6888,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Under pretext of studying literature, a desultory and unformed mind"
6889,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"would naturally return, like the dog of Scripture----”"
6890,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6891,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“‘You’re a damned trencher-scrapin’, napkin-carryin’, shillin’-seekin’,"
6892,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,up-an-down-stairs &c.’” Howell breathed.
6893,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6894,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Beetle choked aloud on the sudden knowledge that King was the ancient
6895,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,and eternal Chucks--later Count Shucksen--of _Peter Simple_. He had not
6896,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,realised it before.
6897,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6898,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Sorry, sir. I’m afraid I’ve been asleep, sir,” he sputtered."
6899,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6900,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,The shout of the Army Class diverted the storm. King was grimly glad
6901,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,that Beetle had condescended to honour truth so far. Perhaps he
6902,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,would now lend his awakened ear to a summary of the externals of Dr.
6903,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Johnson, as limned by Macaulay. And he read, with intention, the just"
6904,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"historian’s outline of a grotesque figure with untied shoe-strings,"
6905,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"that twitched and grunted, gorged its food, bit its finger-nails, and"
6906,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,neglected its ablutions. The Form hailed it as a speaking likeness of
6907,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Beetle; nor were they corrected.
6908,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6909,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Then King implored him to vouchsafe his comrades one single fact
6910,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,connected with Dr. Johnson which might at any time have adhered to
6911,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"what, for decency’s sake, must, Mr. King supposed, be called his mind."
6912,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6913,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Beetle was understood to say that the only thing he could remember was
6914,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,in French.
6915,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6916,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“You add, then, the Gallic tongue to your accomplishments? The"
6917,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"information plus the accent? ’Tis well! Admirable Crichton, proceed!”"
6918,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6919,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,And Beetle proceeded with the text of an old Du Maurier drawing in a
6920,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,back-number of _Punch_:
6921,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6922,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“De tous ces défunts cockolores
6923,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Le moral Fénelon,"
6924,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Michel Ange et Johnson
6925,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,(Le Docteur) sont les plus awful bores.”
6926,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6927,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"To which Howell, wooingly, just above his breath:"
6928,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6929,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“‘Oh, _won’t_ you come up, come up?’”"
6930,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6931,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Result, as the tea-bell rang, one hundred lines, to be shown up at"
6932,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,seven-forty-five that evening. This was meant to blast the pleasant
6933,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"summer interval between tea and prep. Howell, a favourite in “English”"
6934,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"as well as Latin, got off; but the Army Class crashed in to tea with a"
6935,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,new Limerick.
6936,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6937,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,*       *       *       *       *
6938,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6939,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"The imposition was a matter of book-keeping, as far as Beetle was"
6940,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,concerned; for it was his custom of rainy afternoons to fabricate
6941,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,store of lines in anticipation of just these accidents. They covered
6942,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"such English verse as interested him at the moment, and helped to fix"
6943,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"the stuff in his memory. After tea, he drew the required amount from"
6944,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"his drawer in Number Five Study, thrust it into his pocket, went up"
6945,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"to the Head’s house, and settled himself in the big Outer Library"
6946,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"where, ever since the Head had taken him off all mathematics, he"
6947,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,did précis-work and French translation. Here he buried himself in a
6948,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"close-printed, thickish volume which had been his chosen browse for"
6949,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"some time. A hideous account of a hanging, drawing, and quartering"
6950,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,had first attracted him to it; but later he discovered the book
6951,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,(_Curiosities of Literature_ was its name) full of the finest confused
6952,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"feeding--such as forgeries and hoaxes, Italian literary societies,"
6953,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,religious and scholastic controversies of old when men (even that most
6954,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"dreary John Milton, of _Lycidas_) slanged each other, not without"
6955,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"dust and heat, in scandalous pamphlets; personal peculiarities of the"
6956,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,great; and a hundred other fascinating inutilities. This evening he
6957,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"fell on a description of wandering, mad Elizabethan beggars, known as"
6958,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Tom-a-Bedlams, with incidental references to Edgar who plays at being a"
6959,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Tom-a-Bedlam in _Lear_, but whom Beetle did not consider at all funny."
6960,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Then, at the foot of a left-hand page, leaped out on him a verse--of"
6961,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"incommunicable splendour, opening doors into inexplicable worlds--from"
6962,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,a song which Tom-a-Bedlams were supposed to sing. It ran:
6963,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6964,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,With a heart of furious fancies
6965,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Whereof I am commander,"
6966,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"With a burning spear and a horse of air,"
6967,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,To the wilderness I wander.
6968,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,With a knight of ghosts and shadows
6969,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"I summoned am to tourney,"
6970,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Ten leagues beyond the wide world’s end--
6971,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Methinks it is no journey.
6972,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6973,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"He sat, mouthing and staring before him, till the prep-bell rang and it"
6974,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"was time to take his lines up to King’s study and lay them, as hot from"
6975,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"the press, in the impot-basket appointed. He carried his dreams on to"
6976,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Number Five. They knew the symptoms of old.
6977,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6978,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Readin’ again,” said Stalky, like a wife welcoming her spouse from the"
6979,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,pot-house.
6980,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6981,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Look here, I’ve found out something----” Beetle began. “Listen----”"
6982,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6983,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“No, you don’t--till afterwards. It’s Turkey’s prep.” This meant it"
6984,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,was a Horace Ode through which Turkey would take them for a literal
6985,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"translation, and all possible pitfalls. Stalky gave his businesslike"
6986,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"attention, but Beetle’s eye was glazed and his mind adrift throughout,"
6987,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"and he asked for things to be repeated. So, when Turkey closed the"
6988,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Horace, justice began to be executed."
6989,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6990,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“I’m all right,” he protested. “I swear I heard a lot what Turkey said."
6991,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Shut up! Oh, shut _up_! Do shut up, you putrid asses.” Beetle was"
6992,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"speaking from the fender, his head between Turkey’s knees, and Stalky"
6993,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,largely over the rest of him.
6994,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6995,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“What’s the metre of the beastly thing?” McTurk waved his Horace. “Look
6996,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"it up, Stalky. Twelfth of the Third.”"
6997,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
6998,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“_Ionicum a minore_,” Stalky reported, closing his book in turn. “Don’t"
6999,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,let him forget it”; and Turkey’s Horace marked the metre on Beetle’s
7000,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"skull, with special attention to elisions. It hurt."
7001,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7002,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Miserar’ est neq’ amori dare ludum neque dulci
7003,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Mala vino laver’ aut ex----”
7004,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7005,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Got it? You liar! You’ve no ear at all! Chorus, Stalky!”"
7006,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7007,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Both Horaces strove to impart the measure, which was altogether"
7008,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,different from its accompaniment. Presently Howell dashed in from his
7009,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,study below.
7010,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7011,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Look _out_! If you make this infernal din we’ll have some one up the
7012,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,staircase in a sec.”
7013,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7014,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“We’re teachin’ Beetle Horace. He was goin’ to burble us some muck he’d
7015,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"read,” the tutors explained."
7016,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7017,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“’Twasn’t muck! It was about those Tom-a-Bedlams in _Lear_.”
7018,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7019,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Oh!” said Stalky. “Why didn’t you say so?”
7020,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7021,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“’Cause you didn’t listen. They had drinkin’-horns an’ badges, and"
7022,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,there’s a Johnson note on Shakespeare about the meanin’ of Edgar sayin’
7023,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,‘My horn’s dry.’ But Johnson’s dead-wrong about it. Aubrey says----”
7024,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7025,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Who’s Aubrey?” Howell demanded. “Does King know about him?”
7026,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7027,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Dunno. Oh yes, an’ Johnson started to learn Dutch when he was seventy.”"
7028,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7029,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“What the deuce for?” Stalky asked.
7030,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7031,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“For a change after his Dikker, I suppose,” Howell suggested."
7032,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7033,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“And I looked up a lot of other English stuff, too. I’m goin’ to try it"
7034,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,all on King.”
7035,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7036,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Showin’-off as usual,” said the acid McTurk, who, like his race, lived"
7037,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,and loved to destroy illusions.
7038,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7039,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“No. For a draw. He’s an unjust dog! If you read, he says you’re"
7040,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"showin’-off. If you don’t, you’re a mark-huntin’ Philistine. What does"
7041,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"he want you to do, curse him?”"
7042,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7043,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Shut up, Beetle!” Stalky pronounced. “There’s more than draws in this."
7044,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,You’ve cribbed your maths off me ever since you came to Coll. You don’t
7045,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"know what a co-sine is, even _now_. Turkey does all your Latin.”"
7046,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7047,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“I like that! Who does both your _Picciolas_?”
7048,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7049,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“French don’t count. It’s time you began to work for your giddy livin’
7050,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,an’ help us. _You_ aren’t goin’ up for anythin’ that matters. Play for
7051,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"your side, as Heffles says, or die the death! You don’t want to die"
7052,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"the death, again, do you? Now, let’s hear about that stinkard Johnson"
7053,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"swottin’ Dutch. You’re sure it was Sammivel, not Binjamin? You _are_ so"
7054,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,dam’ inaccurate!”
7055,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7056,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Beetle conducted an attentive class on the curiosities of literature
7057,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"for nearly a quarter of an hour. As Stalky pointed out, he promised to"
7058,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,be useful.
7059,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7060,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,*       *       *       *       *
7061,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7062,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"The Horace Ode next morning ran well; and King was content. Then, in"
7063,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"full feather, he sailed round the firmament at large, and, somehow,"
7064,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"apropos to something or other, used the word “della Cruscan”--“if any"
7065,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,of you have the faintest idea of its origin.” Some one hadn’t caught it
7066,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"correctly; which gave Beetle just time to whisper “Bran--an’ mills,” to"
7067,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Howell, who said promptly: “Hasn’t it somethin’ to do with mills--an’"
7068,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"bran, sir?” King cast himself into poses of stricken wonder. “Oddly"
7069,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"enough,” said he, “it has.”"
7070,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7071,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,They were then told a great deal about some silly Italian Academy
7072,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,of Letters which borrowed its office furniture from the equipment
7073,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,of mediæval flour-mills. And: “How has our Ap-Howell come by his
7074,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"knowledge?” Howell, being, indeed, Welsh, thought that it might have"
7075,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,been something he had read in the holidays. King openly purred over him.
7076,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7077,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“If that had been _me_,” Beetle observed while they were toying with"
7078,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"sardines between lessons, “he’d ha’ dropped on me for showin’-off.”"
7079,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7080,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“See what we’re savin’ you from,” Stalky answered. “I’m playin’"
7081,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Johnson, ’member, this afternoon.”"
7082,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7083,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"That, too, came cleanly off the bat; and King was gratified by this"
7084,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,interest in the Doctor’s studies. But Stalky hadn’t a ghost of a notion
7085,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,how he had come by the fact.
7086,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7087,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Why didn’t you say your father told you?” Beetle asked at tea.
7088,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7089,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“My-y Lord! Have you ever seen the guv’nor?” Stalky collapsed shrieking
7090,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"among the piles of bread and butter. “Well, look here. Taffy goes in"
7091,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,to-morrow about those drinkin’ horns an’ Tom-a-Bedlams. You cut up to
7092,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"the library after tea, Beetle. You know what King’s English papers are"
7093,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,like. Look out useful stuff for answers an’ we’ll divvy at prep.”
7094,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7095,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"At prep, then, Beetle, loaded with assorted curiosities, made"
7096,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,his forecast. He argued that there were bound to be a good many
7097,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“what-do-you-know-abouts” those infernal Augustans. Pope was generally
7098,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"a separate item; but the odds were that Swift, Addison, Steele,"
7099,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Johnson, and Goldsmith would be lumped under one head. Dryden was"
7100,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"possible, too, though rather outside the Epoch."
7101,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7102,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Dryden. Oh! ‘Glorious John!’ ’Know _that_ much, anyhow,” Stalky"
7103,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,vaunted.
7104,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7105,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Then lug in Claude Halcro in the _Pirate_,” Beetle advised. “He’s"
7106,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"always sayin’ ‘Glorious John.’ King’s a hog on Scott, too.”"
7107,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7108,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“No-o. I don’t read Scott. You take this Hell Crow chap, Taffy.”"
7109,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7110,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Right. What about Addison, Beetle?” Howell asked."
7111,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7112,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“’Drank like a giddy fish.”
7113,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7114,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“We all know that,” chorused the gentle children."
7115,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7116,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“He said, ‘See how a Christian can die’; an’ he hadn’t any"
7117,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"conversation, ’cause some one or other----”"
7118,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7119,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Guessin’ again, _as_ usual,” McTurk sneered. “Who?”"
7120,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7121,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“’Cynical man called Mandeville--said he was a silent parson in a
7122,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,tie-wig.”
7123,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7124,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Right-ho! I’ll take the silent parson with wig and ’purtenances. Taffy
7125,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"can have the dyin’ Christian,” Stalky decided."
7126,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7127,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Howell nodded, and resumed: “What about Swift, Beetle?”"
7128,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7129,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“’Died mad. Two girls. Saw a tree, an’ said: ‘I shall die at the top.’"
7130,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Oh yes, an’ his private amusements were ‘ridiculous an’ trivial.’”"
7131,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7132,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Howell shook a wary head. “Dunno what that might let me in for with
7133,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"King. You can have it, Stalky.”"
7134,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7135,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“I’ll take that,” McTurk yawned. “King doesn’t matter a curse to me,"
7136,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,an’ he knows it. ‘Private amusements contemptible.’” He breathed all
7137,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Ireland into the last perverted word.
7138,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7139,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Right,” Howell assented. “Bags I the dyin’ tree, then.”"
7140,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7141,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“’Cheery lot, these Augustans,” Stalky sighed. “’Any more of ’em been"
7142,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"croakin’ lately, Beetle?”"
7143,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7144,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“My Hat!” the far-seeing Howell struck in. “King always gives us a
7145,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"stinker half-way down. What about Richardson--that ‘Clarissa’ chap,"
7146,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,y’know?”
7147,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7148,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“I’ve found out lots about him,” said Beetle, promptly."
7149,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7150,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“He was the ‘Shakespeare of novelists.’”
7151,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7152,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“King won’t stand that. He says there’s only one Shakespeare. ’Mustn’t
7153,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"rot about Shakespeare to King,” Howell objected."
7154,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7155,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“An’ he was ‘always delighted with his own works,’” Beetle continued."
7156,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7157,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Like you,” Stalky pointed out."
7158,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7159,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Shut up. Oh yes, an’----” he consulted some hieroglyphics on a scrap"
7160,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,of paper--“the--the impassioned Diderot (dunno who _he_ was) broke
7161,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"forth: ‘O Richardson, thou singular genius!’”"
7162,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7163,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Howell and Stalky rose together, each clamouring that he had bagged"
7164,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,that first.
7165,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7166,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“I _must_ have it!” Howell shouted. “King’s never seen me breakin’
7167,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"forth with the impassioned Diderot. He’s _got_ to! Give me Diderot, you"
7168,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,impassioned hound!”
7169,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7170,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Don’t upset the table. There’s tons more. An’ his genius was ‘fertile
7171,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,and prodigal.’”
7172,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7173,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“All right! _I_ don’t mind bein’ ‘fertile and prodigal’ for a change,”"
7174,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Stalky volunteered. “King’s going to enjoy this exam. If he was the
7175,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Army Prelim. chap we’d score.”
7176,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7177,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“The Prelim. questions will be pretty much like King’s stuff,” Beetle"
7178,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,assured them.
7179,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7180,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“But it’s always a score to know what your examiner’s keen on,” Howell"
7181,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"said, and illustrated it with an anecdote. “’Uncle of mine stayin’ with"
7182,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,my people last holidays----”
7183,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7184,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Your Uncle Diderot?” Stalky asked.
7185,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7186,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“No, you ass! Captain of Engineers. He told me he was up for a Staff"
7187,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,exam. to an old Colonel-bird who believed that the English were the
7188,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"lost Tribes of Israel, or something like that. He’d written tons o’"
7189,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,books about it.”
7190,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7191,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“All Sappers are mad,” said Stalky. “That’s one of the things the"
7192,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,guv’nor _did_ tell me.”
7193,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7194,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Well, ne’er mind. My uncle played up, o’ course. ’Said he’d"
7195,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"always believed it, too. And _so_ he got nearly top-marks for"
7196,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"field-fortification. ’Didn’t know a thing about it, either, he said.”"
7197,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7198,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Good biznai!” said Stalky. “Well, go on, Beetle. What about Steele?”"
7199,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7200,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Can’t I keep anything for myself?”
7201,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7202,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Not _much_! King’ll ask you where you got it from, and you’d show off,"
7203,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"an’ he’d find out. This ain’t your silly English Literature, you ass."
7204,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,It’s our marks. Can’t you see that?”
7205,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7206,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Beetle very soon saw it was exactly as Stalky had said.
7207,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7208,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,*       *       *       *       *
7209,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7210,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Some days later a happy, and therefore not too likeable, King was"
7211,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"explaining to the Reverend John in his own study how effort, zeal,"
7212,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"scholarship, the humanities, and perhaps a little natural genius for"
7213,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"teaching, could inspire even the mark-hunting minds of the young. His"
7214,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,text was the result of his General Knowledge paper on the Augustans and
7215,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,_King Lear_.
7216,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7217,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Howell,” he said, “I was not surprised at. He _has_ intelligence. But,"
7218,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"frankly, I did not expect young Corkran to burgeon. Almost one might"
7219,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,believe he occasionally read a book.”
7220,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7221,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“And McTurk too?”
7222,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7223,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Yes. He had somehow arrived at a rather just estimate of Swift’s
7224,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,lighter literary diversions. They _are_ contemptible. And in the ‘Lear’
7225,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,questions--they were all attracted by Edgar’s character--Stalky had dug
7226,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,up something about Aubrey on Tom-a-Bedlams from some unknown source.
7227,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Aubrey, of all people! I’m sure I only alluded to him once or twice.”"
7228,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7229,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Stalky among the prophets of ‘English’! And he didn’t remember where
7230,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,he’d got it either?”
7231,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7232,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“No. Boys are amazingly purblind and limited. But if they keep this
7233,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"up at the Army Prelim., it is conceivable the Class may not do itself"
7234,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,discredit. I told them so.”
7235,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7236,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“I congratulate you. Ours is the hardest calling in the world, with the"
7237,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"least reward. By the way, who are they likely to send down to examine"
7238,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,us?”
7239,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7240,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“It rests between two, I fancy. Martlett--with me at Balliol--and"
7241,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Hume. _They_ wisely chose the Civil Service. Martlett has published
7242,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"a brochure on Minor Elizabethan Verse--journeyman work, of"
7243,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"course--enthusiasms, but no grounding. Hume I heard of lately as having"
7244,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,infected himself in Germany with some Transatlantic abominations about
7245,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Shakespeare and Bacon. He was Sutton.” (The Head, by the way, was a"
7246,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Sutton man.)
7247,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7248,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"King returned to his examination-papers and read extracts from them, as"
7249,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,mothers repeat the clever sayings of their babes.
7250,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7251,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Here’s old Taffy Howell, for instance--apropos to Diderot’s eulogy of"
7252,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Richardson. ‘The impassioned Diderot broke forth: “Richardson, thou"
7253,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,singular genius!”’”
7254,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7255,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"It was the Reverend John who stopped himself, just in time, from"
7256,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"breaking forth. He recalled that, some days ago, he had heard Stalky on"
7257,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"the stairs of Number Five, hurling the boots of many fags at Howell’s"
7258,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,door and bidding the “impassioned Diderot” within “break forth” at his
7259,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,peril.
7260,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7261,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Odd,” said he, gravely, when his pipe drew again. “Where did Diderot"
7262,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,say that?”
7263,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7264,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“I’ve forgotten for the moment. Taffy told me he’d picked it up in the
7265,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,course of holiday reading.”
7266,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7267,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Possibly. One never knows what heifers the young are ploughing with.
7268,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Oh! How did Beetle do?”
7269,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7270,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“The necessary dates and his handwriting defeated him, I’m glad to"
7271,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,say. I cannot accuse myself of having missed any opportunity to
7272,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,castigate that boy’s inordinate and intolerable conceit. But I’m afraid
7273,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"it’s hopeless. I think I touched him somewhat, though, when I read"
7274,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Macaulay’s stock piece on Johnson. The others saw it at once.”
7275,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7276,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Yes, you told me about that at the time,” said the Reverend John,"
7277,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,hurriedly.
7278,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7279,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“And our esteemed Head having taken him off maths for this
7280,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,précis-writing--whatever that means!--has turned him into a most
7281,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"objectionable free-lance. He was without any sense of reverence before,"
7282,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,and promiscuous cheap fiction--which is all that his type of reading
7283,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,means--aggravates his worst points. When it came to a trial he was
7284,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,simply nowhere.”
7285,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7286,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Ah, well! Ours is a hard calling--specially if one’s sensitive."
7287,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Luckily, I’m too fat.” The Reverend John went out to bathe off the"
7288,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Pebble Ridge, girt with a fair linen towel whose red fringe signalled"
7289,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,from half a mile away.
7290,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7291,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,*       *       *       *       *
7292,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7293,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"There lurked on summer afternoons, round the fives-court or the gym,"
7294,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,certain watchful outcasts who had exhausted their weekly ration of
7295,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"three baths, and who were too well known to Cory the bathman to outface"
7296,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,him by swearing that they hadn’t. These came in like sycophantic pups
7297,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"at walk, and when the Reverend John climbed the Pebble Ridge, more than"
7298,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"a dozen of them were at his heels, with never a towel among them. One"
7299,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"could only bathe off the Ridge with a House Master, but by custom, a"
7300,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"dozen details above a certain age, no matter whence recruited, made"
7301,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"a “House” for bathing, if any kindly Master chose so to regard them."
7302,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Beetle led the low, growing reminder: “House! House, sir? We’ve got a"
7303,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"House now, Padre.”"
7304,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7305,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Let it be law as it is desired,” boomed the Reverend John. On which"
7306,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"word they broke forward, hirpling over the unstable pebbles and"
7307,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"stripping as they ran, till, when they touched the sands, they were as"
7308,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"naked as God had made them, and as happy as He intended them to be."
7309,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7310,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"It was half-flood--dead-smooth, except for the triple line of combers,"
7311,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"a mile from wing to wing, that broke evenly with a sound of ripping"
7312,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"canvas, while their sleek rear-guards formed up behind. One swam forth,"
7313,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"trying to copy the roll, rise, and dig-out of the Reverend John’s"
7314,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"side-stroke, and manœuvred to meet them so that they should crash on"
7315,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"one’s head, when for an instant one glanced down arched perspectives"
7316,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"of beryl, before all broke in fizzy, electric diamonds and the pulse"
7317,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,of the main surge slung one towards the beach. From a good comber’s
7318,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,crest one was hove up almost to see Lundy on the horizon. In its long
7319,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"cream-streaked trough, when the top had turned over and gone on, one"
7320,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,might be alone in mid-Atlantic. Either way it was divine. Then one
7321,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"capered on the sands till one dried off; retrieved scattered flannels,"
7322,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"gave thanks in chorus to the Reverend John, and lazily trailed up to"
7323,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"five-o’clock call-over, taken on the lower cricket field."
7324,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7325,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Eight this week,” said Beetle, and thanked Heaven aloud."
7326,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7327,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Bathing seems to have sapped your mind,” the Reverend John remarked."
7328,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Why did you do so vilely with the Augustans?”
7329,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7330,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“They _are_ vile, Padre. So’s _Lear_.”"
7331,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7332,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“The other two did all right, though.”"
7333,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7334,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“I expect they’ve been swottin’,” Beetle grinned."
7335,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7336,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“I’ve expected that, too, in my time. But I want to hear about the"
7337,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"‘impassioned Diderot,’ please.”"
7338,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7339,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Oh, that was Howell, Padre. You mean when Diderot broke forth:"
7340,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"‘Richardson, thou singular genius’? He’d read it in the holidays"
7341,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,somewhere.”
7342,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7343,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“I _beg_ your pardon. Naturally, Taffy would read Diderot in the"
7344,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"holidays. Well, I’m sorry I can’t lick you for this; but if any one"
7345,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"ever finds out anything about it, you’ve only yourself to thank.”"
7346,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7347,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Beetle went up to College and to the Outer Library, where he had"
7348,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"on tap the last of a book called _Elsie Venner_, by a man called"
7349,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Oliver Wendell Holmes--all about a girl who was interestingly allied
7350,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"to rattlesnakes. He finished what was left of her, and cast about"
7351,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"for more from the same hand, which he found on the same shelf, with"
7352,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,the trifling difference that the writer’s Christian name was now
7353,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Nathaniel, and he did not deal in snakes. The authorship of Shakespeare"
7354,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,was his theme--not that Shakespeare with whom King oppressed the
7355,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Army Class, but a low-born, poaching, ignorant, immoral village"
7356,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,lout who could not have written one line of any play ascribed to
7357,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,him. (Beetle wondered what King would say to Nathaniel if ever they
7358,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"met.) The real author was Francis Bacon, of Bacon’s Essays, which"
7359,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,did not strike Beetle as any improvement. He had “done” the essays
7360,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"last term. But evidently Nathaniel’s views annoyed people, for the"
7361,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"margins of his book--it was second-hand, and the old label of a public"
7362,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"library still adhered--flamed with ribald, abusive, and contemptuous"
7363,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,comments by various hands. They ranged from “Rot!” “Rubbish!” and
7364,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,such like to crisp counter-arguments. And several times some one
7365,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"had written: “This beats Delia.” One copious annotator dissented,"
7366,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"saying: “Delia is supreme in this line,” “Delia beats this hollow.”"
7367,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“See Delia’s Philosophy, page so and so.” Beetle grieved he could"
7368,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,not find anything about Delia (he had often heard King’s views on
7369,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"lady-writers as a class) beyond a statement by Nathaniel, with"
7370,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,pencilled exclamation-points rocketting all round it that “Delia
7371,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Bacon discovered in Francis Bacon a good deal more than Macaulay.”
7372,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Taking it by and large, with the kind help of the marginal notes, it"
7373,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,appeared that Delia and Nathaniel between them had perpetrated every
7374,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,conceivable outrage against the Head-God of King’s idolatry: and King
7375,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,was particular about his idols. Without pronouncing on the merits
7376,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"of the controversy, it occurred to Beetle that a well-mixed dose of"
7377,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Nathaniel ought to work on King like a seidlitz powder. At this point
7378,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"a pencil and a half sheet of impot-paper came into action, and he went"
7379,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,down to tea so swelled with Baconian heresies and blasphemies that he
7380,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,could only stutter between mouthfuls. He returned to his labours after
7381,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"the meal, and was visibly worse at prep."
7382,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7383,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“I say,” he began, “have you ever heard that Shakespeare never wrote"
7384,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,his own beastly plays?”
7385,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7386,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“’Fat lot of good to us!” said Stalky. “We’ve got to swot ’em up just
7387,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,the same. Look here! This is for English parsin’ to-morrow. It’s _your_
7388,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"biznai.” He read swiftly from the school _Lear_ (Act II., Sc. 2) thus:"
7389,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7390,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Steward:
7391,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Never any:
7392,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"It pleased the King his master, very late,"
7393,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;"
7394,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"When he, conjunct, an’ flatterin’ his displeasure,"
7395,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Tripped me behind: bein’ down, insulted, railed,"
7396,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"And put upon him such a deal of man,"
7397,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"That worthy’d him, got praises of the King"
7398,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,For him attemptin’ who was self-subdued;
7399,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,"
7400,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Drew me on here.”
7401,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7402,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Now then, my impassioned bard, _construez_! That’s Shakespeare.”"
7403,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7404,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“’Give it up! He’s drunk,” Beetle declared at the end of a blank half"
7405,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,minute.
7406,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7407,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“No, he isn’t,” said Turkey. “He’s a steward--on the estate--chattin’"
7408,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,to his employers.”
7409,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7410,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Well--look here, Turkey. You ask King if Shakespeare ever wrote his"
7411,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"own plays, an’ he won’t give a dam’ what the steward said.”"
7412,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7413,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“I’ve not come here to play with ushers,” was McTurk’s view of the case."
7414,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7415,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“I’d do it,” Beetle protested, “only he’d slay _me_! He don’t love me"
7416,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,when I ask about things. I can give you the stuff to draw him--tons
7417,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"of it!” He broke forth into a précis, interspersed with praises, of"
7418,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Nathaniel Holmes and his commentators--especially the latter. He also
7419,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"mentioned Delia, with sorrow that he had not read her. He spoke through"
7420,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,nearly the whole of prep; and the upshot of it was that McTurk relented
7421,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,and promised to approach King next “English” on the authenticity of
7422,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Shakespeare’s plays.
7423,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,

7425,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7426,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,The time and tone chosen were admirable. While King was warming himself
7427,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"by a preliminary canter round the Form’s literary deficiencies, Turkey"
7428,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,coughed in a style which suggested a reminder to a slack _employé_
7429,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,that it was time to stop chattering and get to work. As King began to
7430,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"bristle, Turkey inquired: “I’d be glad to know, sir, if it’s true that"
7431,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Shakespeare did not write his own plays at all?”
7432,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7433,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Good God!” said King most distinctly. Turkey coughed again piously.
7434,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“They all say so in Ireland, sir.”"
7435,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7436,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Ireland--Ireland--Ireland!” King overran Ireland with one blast of
7437,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,flame that should have been written in letters of brass for instruction
7438,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"to-day. At the end, Turkey coughed once more, and the cough said: “It"
7439,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"is Shakespeare, and not my country, that you are hired to interpret to"
7440,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"me.” He put it directly, too: “An’ is it true at all about the alleged"
7441,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"plays, sir?”"
7442,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7443,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“It is not,” Mr. King whispered, and began to explain, on lines that"
7444,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"might, perhaps, have been too freely expressed for the parents of those"
7445,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"young (though it gave their offspring delight), but with a passion,"
7446,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"force, and wealth of imagery which would have crowned his discourse at"
7447,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,any university. By the time he drew towards his peroration the Form was
7448,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,almost openly applauding. Howell noiselessly drummed the cadence of
7449,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Bonnie Dundee” on his desk; Paddy Vernon framed a dumb: “Played! Oh,"
7450,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"_well_ played, sir!” at intervals; Stalky kept tally of the brighter"
7451,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,gems of invective; and Beetle sat aghast but exulting among the spirits
7452,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"he had called up. For though their works had never been mentioned,"
7453,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,and though Mr. King said he had merely glanced at the obscene
7454,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"publications, he seemed to know a tremendous amount about Nathaniel and"
7455,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Delia--especially Delia.
7456,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7457,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“I told you so!” said Beetle, proudly, at the end."
7458,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7459,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“What? _Him!_ I wasn’t botherin’ myself to listen to him an’ his
7460,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Delia,” McTurk replied."
7461,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7462,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Afterwards King fought his battle over again with the Reverend John in
7463,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,the Common Room.
7464,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7465,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Had I been that triple ass Hume, I might have risen to the bait. As it"
7466,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"is, I flatter myself I left them under no delusions as to Shakespeare’s"
7467,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"authenticity. Yes, a small drink, please. Virtue has gone out of me"
7468,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,indeed. But _where_ did they get it from?”
7469,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7470,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“The devil! The young devil,” the Reverend John muttered, half aloud."
7471,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7472,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“I could have excused devilry. It was ignorance. Sheer, crass, insolent"
7473,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"provincial ignorance! I tell you, Gillett, if the Romans had dealt"
7474,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"faithfully with the Celt, _ab initio_, this--this would never have"
7475,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,happened.”
7476,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7477,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Quite so. I should like to have heard your remarks.” “I’ve told ’em
7478,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"to tell me what they remember of them, with their own conclusions, in"
7479,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,essay form next week.”
7480,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7481,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Since he had loosed the whirlwind, the fair-minded Beetle offered to"
7482,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"do Turkey’s essay for him. On Turkey’s behalf, then, he dealt with"
7483,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Shakespeare’s lack of education, his butchering, poaching, drinking,"
7484,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"horse-holding, and errand-running as Nathaniel had described them;"
7485,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"lifted from the same source pleasant names, such as “rustic” and “sorry"
7486,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"poetaster,” on which last special hopes were built; and expressed"
7487,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,surprise that one so ignorant could have done “what he was attributed
7488,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"to.” His own essay contained no novelties. Indeed, he withheld one or"
7489,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,two promising “subsequently transpireds” for fear of distracting King.
7490,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7491,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,*       *       *       *       *
7492,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7493,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"But, when the essays were read, Mr. King confined himself wholly to"
7494,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Turkey’s pitiful, puerile, jejune, exploded, unbaked, half-bottomed"
7495,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"thesis. He touched, too, on the “lie in the soul,” which was,"
7496,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"fundamentally, vulgarity--the negation of Reverence and the Decencies."
7497,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"He broke forth into an impassioned defence of “mere atheism,” which he"
7498,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,said was often no more than mental flatulence--transitory and curable
7499,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"by knowledge of life--in no way comparable, for essential enormity,"
7500,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,with the debasing pagan abominations to which Turkey had delivered
7501,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"himself. He ended with a shocking story about one Jowett, who seemed to"
7502,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"have held some post of authority where King came from, and who had told"
7503,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,an atheistical undergraduate that if he could not believe in a Personal
7504,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"God by five that afternoon he would be expelled--as, with tears of rage"
7505,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"in his eyes, King regretted that he could not expel McTurk. And Turkey"
7506,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,blew his nose in the middle of it.
7507,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7508,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"But the aim of education being to develop individual judgment, King"
7509,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,could not well kill him for his honest doubts about Shakespeare. And
7510,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"he himself had several times quoted, in respect to other poets: “There"
7511,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"lives more faith in honest doubt, Believe me, than in half the creeds.”"
7512,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,So he treated Turkey in Form like a coiled puff-adder; and there was a
7513,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,tense peace among the Augustans. The only ripple was the day before the
7514,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Army Examiner came, when Beetle inquired if he “need take this exam.,"
7515,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"sir, as I’m not goin’ up for anything.” Mr. King said there was great"
7516,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"need--for many reasons, none of them flattering to vanity."
7517,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7518,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"As far as the Army Class could judge, the Examiner was not worse than"
7519,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"his breed, and the written “English” paper ran closely on the lines of"
7520,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,King’s mid-term General Knowledge test. Howell played his “impassioned
7521,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Diderot” to the Richardson lead; Stalky his parson in the wig; McTurk
7522,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"his contemptible Swift; Beetle, Steele’s affectionate notes out of"
7523,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"the spunging-house to “Dearest Prue,” all in due order. There were,"
7524,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"however, one or two leading questions about Shakespeare. A boy’s hand"
7525,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,shot up from a back bench.
7526,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7527,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“In answering Number Seven--reasons for Shakespeare’s dramatic
7528,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"supremacy”--he said, “are we to take it Shakespeare _did_ write the"
7529,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"plays he is supposed to have written, sir?”"
7530,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7531,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,The Examiner hesitated an instant. “It is generally assumed that he
7532,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,did.” But there was no reproof in his words. Beetle began to sit down
7533,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,slowly.
7534,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7535,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Another hand and another voice: “Have we got to say we believe he did,"
7536,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,sir? Even if we do not?”
7537,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7538,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“You are not called upon to state your beliefs. But we can go into that
7539,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,at _viva voce_ this afternoon--if it interests you.”
7540,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7541,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Thank you, sir.”"
7542,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7543,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“What did you do that for?” Paddy Vernon demanded at dinner.
7544,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7545,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“It’s the lost tribes of Israel game, you ass,” said Howell."
7546,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7547,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“To make sure,” Stalky amplified. “If he was like King, he’d have shut"
7548,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"up Beetle an’ Turkey at the start, but he’d have thought King gave us"
7549,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"the Bacon notion. Well, he didn’t shut ’em up; so they’re playin’ it"
7550,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"again this afternoon. If he stands it then, he’ll be sure King gave us"
7551,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"the notion. Either way, it’s dead-safe for us--_an’_ King.”"
7552,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7553,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"At the afternoon’s _viva voce_, before they sat down to the Augustans,"
7554,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"the Examiner wished to hear, “with no bearing on the examination, of"
7555,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"course,” from those two candidates who had asked him about Question"
7556,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Seven. Which were they?
7557,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7558,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Take off your gigs, you owl,” said Stalky between his teeth. Beetle"
7559,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,pocketed them and looked into blurred vacancy with a voice coming out
7560,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,of it that asked: “Who--what gave you that idea about Shakespeare?”
7561,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,From Stalky’s kick he knew the question was for him.
7562,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7563,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Some people say, sir, there’s a good deal of doubt about it nowadays,"
7564,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,sir.”
7565,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7566,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Ye-es, that’s true, but----”"
7567,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7568,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“It’s his knowin’ so much about legal phrases,” Turkey was in"
7569,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,support--a lone gun barking somewhere to his right.
7570,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7571,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“That is a crux, I admit. Of course, whatever one may think privately,"
7572,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,officially Shakespeare _is_ Shakespeare. But how have _you_ been taught
7573,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,to look at the question?”
7574,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7575,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Well, Holmes says it’s impossible he could----”"
7576,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7577,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“On the legal phraseology alone, sir,” McTurk chimed in."
7578,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7579,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Ah, but the theory is that Shakespeare’s experiences in the society of"
7580,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,that day brought him in contact with all the leading intellects.” The
7581,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Examiner’s voice was quite colloquial now.
7582,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7583,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“But they didn’t think much of actors then, sir, did they?” This was"
7584,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,Howell cooing like a cushat dove. “I mean----”
7585,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7586,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,The Examiner explained the status of the Elizabethan actor in some
7587,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"detail, ending: “And that makes it the more curious, doesn’t it?”"
7588,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7589,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“And this Shakespeare was supposed to be writin’ plays and actin’ in
7590,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"’em _all_ the time?” McTurk asked, with sinister meaning."
7591,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7592,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“Exactly what I--what lots of people have pointed out. Where did he get
7593,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,the time to acquire all his special knowledge?”
7594,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7595,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Then it looks as if there was something in it, doesn’t it, sir?”"
7596,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7597,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“That,” said the Examiner, squaring his elbows at ease on the desk, “is"
7598,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,a very large question which----”
7599,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7600,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“Yes, sir!”--in half-a-dozen eagerly attentive keys...."
7601,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7602,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,For decency’s sake a few Augustan questions were crammed in
7603,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"conscience-strickenly, about the last ten minutes. Howell took them"
7604,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"since they involved dates, but the answers, though highly marked,"
7605,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,were scarcely heeded. When the clock showed six-thirty the Examiner
7606,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,addressed them as “Gentlemen”; and said he would have particular
7607,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"pleasure in speaking well of this Army Class, which had evinced such a"
7608,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"genuine and unusual interest in English Literature, and which reflected"
7609,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,the greatest credit on their instructors. He passed out: the Form
7610,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"upstanding, as custom was."
7611,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7612,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“He’s goin’ to congratulate King,” said Howell. “Don’t make a row!"
7613,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,‘Don’t--make--a--noise--Or else you’ll wake the Baby!’”...

7617,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Mr. King of Balliol, after Mr. Hume of Sutton had complimented him, as"
7618,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"was only just, before all his colleagues in Common Room, was kindly"
7619,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"taken by the Reverend John to his study, where he exploded on the"
7620,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,hearth-rug.
7621,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7622,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“He--he thought _I_ had loosed this--this rancid Baconian rot among
7623,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,them. He complimented me on my breadth of mind--my being abreast of the
7624,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,times! You heard him? That’s how they think at Sutton. It’s an open
7625,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"stye! A lair of bestial! They have a chapel there, Gillett, and they"

7628,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“His particular weakness apart, Hume was perfectly sincere about what"
7629,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"you’d done for the Army Class. He’ll report in that sense, too. That’s"
7630,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"a feather in your cap, and a deserved one. He said their interest in"
7631,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"Literature was unusual. That is _all_ your work, King.”"
7632,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7633,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,“But I bowed down in the House of Rimmon while he Baconised all over
7634,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,me!--poor devil of an usher that I am! You heard it! I ought to have
7635,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,spat in his eye! Heaven knows I’m as conscious of my own infirmities
7636,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,as my worst enemy can be; but what have I done to deserve this? What

7638,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,
7639,THE PROPAGATION OF KNOWLEDGE,"“That’s just what I was wondering,” the Reverend John replied. “Have"

7674,A LEGEND OF TRUTH,"Looked on the world, but, hearing how it lied,"

7725,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"There had been rather a long sitting at Lodge “Faith and Works,” 5837"
7726,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"E. C., that warm April night. Three initiations and two raisings, each"
7727,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,conducted with the spaciousness and particularity that our Lodge prides
7728,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"itself upon, made the Brethren a little silent and the strains of"
7729,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,certain music had not yet lifted from them.
7730,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7731,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“There are two pieces that ought to be barred for ever,” said a Brother"
7732,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,as we were sitting down to the “banquet.” “‘Last Post’ is the other.”
7733,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7734,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“I can just stand ‘Last Post.’ It’s ‘Tipperary’ breaks me,” another"
7735,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,replied. “But I expect every one carries his own firing-irons inside
7736,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,him.”
7737,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7738,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,I turned to look. It was a sponsor for one of our newly raised
7739,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"Brethren--a fat man with a fish-like and vacant face, but evidently"
7740,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,prosperous. We introduced ourselves as we took our places. His name was
7741,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"Bevin, and he had a chicken farm near Chalfont-St.-Giles, whence he"
7742,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"supplied, on yearly contract, two or three high-class London hotels. He"
7743,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"was also, he said, on the edge of launching out into herb-growing."
7744,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7745,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“There’s a demand for herbs,” said he; “but it all depends upon your"
7746,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,connections with the wholesale dealers. _We_ ain’t systematic enough.
7747,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"The French do it much better, especially in those mountains on the"
7748,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,Swiss an’ Italian sides. They use more herbal remedies than we do. Our
7749,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,patent-medicine business has killed that with us. But there’s a demand
7750,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"still, if your connections are sound. I’m going in for it.”"
7751,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7752,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"A large, well-groomed Brother across the table (his name was Pole, and"
7753,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,he seemed some sort of professional man) struck in with a detailed
7754,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"account of a hollow behind a destroyed village near Thiepval, where,"
7755,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"for no ascertainable reason, a certain rather scarce herb had sprung up"
7756,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"by the acre, he said, out of the overturned earth."
7757,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7758,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Only you’ve got to poke among the weeds to find it, and there’s any"
7759,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,quantity of bombs an’ stuff knockin’ about there still. They haven’t
7760,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,cleaned it up yet.”
7761,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7762,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Last time _I_ saw the place,” said Bevin, “I thought it ’ud be that"
7763,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,way till Judgment Day. You know how it lay in that dip under that
7764,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,beet-factory. I saw it bombed up level in two days--into brick-dust
7765,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,mainly. They were huntin’ for St. Firmin Dump.” He took a sandwich and
7766,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"munched slowly, wiping his face, for the night was close."
7767,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7768,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Ye-es,” said Pole. “The trouble is there hasn’t been any judgment"
7769,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,taken or executed. That’s why the world is where it is now. We didn’t
7770,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"need anything but justice--afterwards. Not gettin’ that, the bottom"
7771,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"fell out of things, naturally.”"
7772,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7773,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“That’s how I look at it too,” Bevin replied. “We didn’t want all"
7774,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"that talk afterwards--we only wanted justice. What _I_ say is,"
7775,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,there _must_ be a right and a wrong to things. It can’t all be
7776,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"kiss-an’-make-friends, no matter what you do.”"
7777,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7778,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"A thin, dark brother on my left, who had been attending to a cold"
7779,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"pork pie (there are no pork pies to equal ours, which are home-made),"
7780,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"suddenly lifted his long head, in which a pale blue glass eye swivelled"
7781,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,insanely.
7782,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7783,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Well,” he said slowly. “_My_ motto is ‘Never again.’ Ne-ver again for"
7784,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,me.”
7785,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7786,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Same here--till next time,” said Pole, across the table. “You’re from"
7787,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"Sidney, ain’t you?”"
7788,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7789,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“How d’you know!” was the short answer.
7790,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7791,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“You spoke.” The other smiled. So did Bevin, who added: “_I_ know how"
7792,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"your push talk, well enough. Have you started that Republic of yours"
7793,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,down under yet?”
7794,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7795,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“No. But we’re goin’ to. _Then_ you’ll see.”
7796,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7797,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Carry on. No one’s hindering,” Bevin pursued."
7798,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7799,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,The Australian scowled. “No. We know they ain’t. And--and--that’s
7800,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,what makes us all so crazy angry with you.” He threw back his head
7801,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,and laughed the spleen out of him. “What _can_ you do with an Empire
7802,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,that--that don’t care what you do?”
7803,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7804,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“I’ve heard that before,” Bevin laughed, and his fat sides shook. “Oh,"
7805,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,I know _your_ push inside-out.”
7806,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7807,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“When did you come across us? My name’s Orton--no relation to the
7808,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,Tichborne one.”
7809,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7810,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“Gallip’li--dead mostly. My battalion began there. We only lost half.”
7811,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7812,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“Lucky! They gambled _us_ away in two days. ’Member the hospital on the
7813,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,beach?” asked Orton.
7814,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7815,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Yes. An’ the man without the face--preaching,” said Bevin, sitting up"
7816,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,a little.
7817,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7818,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Till he died,” said the Australian, his voice lowered."
7819,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7820,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“_And_ afterwards,” Bevin added, lower still."
7821,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7822,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“Christ! Were you there that night?”
7823,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7824,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"Bevin nodded. The Australian choked off something he was going to say,"
7825,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"as a brother on his left claimed him. I heard them talk horses, while"
7826,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,Bevin developed his herb-growing projects with the well-groomed brother
7827,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,opposite.
7828,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7829,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"At the end of the banquet, when pipes were drawn, the Australian"
7830,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"addressed himself to Bevin, across me, and as the company re-arranged"
7831,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"itself, we three came to anchor in the big ante-room where the best"
7832,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"prints are hung. Here our brother across the table joined us, and"
7833,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,moored alongside.
7834,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7835,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"The Australian was full of racial grievances, as must be in a young"
7836,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,country; alternating between complaints that his people had not been
7837,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"appreciated enough in England, or too fulsomely complimented by an"
7838,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,hysterical Press.
7839,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7840,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“No-o,” Pole drawled, after awhile. “You’re altogether wrong. We hadn’t"
7841,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,time to notice anything--we were all too busy fightin’ for our lives.
7842,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,What _your_ crowd down under are suffering from is growing-pains.
7843,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,You’ll get over ’em in three hundred years or so--if you’re allowed to
7844,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,last so long.”
7845,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7846,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“Who’s going to stoush us?” Orton asked fiercely.
7847,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7848,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,This turned the talk again to larger issues and
7849,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,possibilities--delivered on both sides straight from the shoulder
7850,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"without malice or heat, between bursts of song from round the piano at"
7851,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"the far end. Bevin and I sat out, watching."
7852,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7853,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Well, _I_ don’t understand these matters,” said Bevin at last. “But"
7854,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,I’d hate to have one of your crowd have it in for me for anything.”
7855,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7856,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Would you? Why?” Orton pierced him with his pale, artificial eye."
7857,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7858,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Well, you’re a trifle--what’s the word?--vindictive?--spiteful? At"
7859,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"least, that’s what _I_’ve found. I expect it comes from drinking stewed"
7860,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"tea with your meat four times a day,” said Bevin. “No! I’d hate to have"
7861,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,an Australian after me for anything in particular.”
7862,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7863,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,Out of this came his tale--somewhat in this shape:
7864,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7865,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,It opened with an Australian of the name of Hickmot or Hickmer--Bevin
7866,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"called him both--who, finding his battalion completely expended at"
7867,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"Gallipoli, had joined up with what stood of Bevin’s battalion, and had"
7868,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"there remained, unrebuked and unnoticed. The point that Bevin laboured"
7869,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"was that his man had never seen a table-cloth, a china plate, or a"
7870,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"dozen white people together till, in his thirtieth year, he had walked"
7871,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,for two months to Brisbane to join up. Pole found this hard to believe.
7872,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7873,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“But it’s true,” Bevin insisted. “This chap was born an’ bred among the"
7874,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"black fellers, as they call ’em, two hundred miles from the nearest"
7875,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"town, four hundred miles from a railway, an’ ten thousand from the"
7876,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,grace o’ God--out in Queensland near some desert.”
7877,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7878,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Why, of course. We come out of everywhere,” said Orton. “What’s wrong"
7879,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,with that?”
7880,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7881,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“Yes--but----Look here! From the time that this man Hickmot was twelve
7882,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"years old he’d ridden, driven--what’s the word?--conducted sheep for"
7883,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"his father for thousands of miles on end, an’ months at a time, alone"
7884,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,with these black fellers that you daren’t show the back of your neck
7885,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,to--else they knock your head in. That was all that he’d ever done till
7886,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"he joined up. He--he--didn’t _belong_ to anything in the world, you"
7887,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,understand. And he didn’t strike other men as being a--a human being.”
7888,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7889,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Why? He was a Queensland drover. They’re all right,” Orton explained."
7890,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7891,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“I dare say; but--well, a man notices another man, don’t he? You’d"
7892,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"notice if there was a man standing or sitting or lyin’ near you,"
7893,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,wouldn’t you? So’d any one. But you’d never notice Hickmot. His
7894,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,bein’ anywhere about wouldn’t stay in your mind. He just didn’t draw
7895,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,attention any more than anything else that happened to be about. Have
7896,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,you got it?”
7897,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7898,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“Wasn’t he any use at his job?” Pole inquired.
7899,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7900,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“I’ve nothing against him that way, an’ I’m--I was his platoon"
7901,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"sergeant. He wouldn’t volunteer specially for any doings, but he’d slip"
7902,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,out with the party and he’d slip back with what was left of ’em. No
7903,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"one noticed him, and he never opened his mouth about any doings. You’d"
7904,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,think a man who had lived the way he’d lived among black fellers an’
7905,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"sheep would be noticeable enough in an English battalion, wouldn’t you?”"
7906,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7907,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“It teaches ’em to lie close; but _you_ seem to have noticed him,”"
7908,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"Orton interposed, with a little suspicion."
7909,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7910,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“Not at the time--but afterwards. If he was noticeable it was on
7911,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,account of his _un_noticeability--same way you’d notice there not being
7912,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,an extra step at the bottom of the staircase when you thought there
7913,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,was.”
7914,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7915,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Ye-es,” Pole said suddenly. “It’s the eternal mystery of personality."
7916,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,‘God before Whom ever lie bare----’ Some people can occlude their
7917,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,personality like turning off a tap. I beg your pardon. Carry on!”
7918,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7919,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Granted,” said Bevin. “I think I catch your drift. I used to think I"
7920,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,was a student of human nature before I joined up.”
7921,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7922,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“What was your job--before?” Orton asked.
7923,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7924,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Oh, I was _the_ young blood of the village. Goal-keeper in our soccer"
7925,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"team, secretary of the local cricket and rifle--oh, lor’!--clubs. Yes,"
7926,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,an’ village theatricals. My father was the chemist in the village.
7927,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,_How_ I did talk! _What_ I did know!” He beamed upon us all.
7928,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7929,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“_I_ don’t mind hearing you talk,” said Orton, lying back in his chair."
7930,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“You’re a little different from some of ’em. What happened to this dam’
7931,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,drover of yours?”
7932,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7933,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“He was with our push for the rest of the war--an’ I don’t think he
7934,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"ever sprung a dozen words at one time. With his upbringing, you see,"
7935,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,there wasn’t any subject that any man knew about he _could_ open up on.
7936,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"He kept quiet, and mixed with his backgrounds. If there was a lump of"
7937,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"dirt, or a hole in the ground, or what was--was left after anythin’ had"
7938,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"happened, it would be Hickmot. That was all he wanted to be.”"
7939,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7940,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“A camouflager?” Orton suggested.
7941,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7942,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“You have it! He was the complete camouflager all through. That’s him
7943,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,to a dot. Look here! He hadn’t even a nickname in his platoon! And then
7944,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"a friend of mine from our village, of the name of Vigors, came out with"
7945,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"a draft. Bert Vigors. As a matter of fact, I was engaged to his sister."
7946,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,And Bert hadn’t been with us a week before they called him ‘The Grief.’
7947,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"His father was an oldish man, a market-gardener--high-class vegetables,"
7948,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"bit o’ glass, an’--an’ all the rest of it. Do you know anything about"
7949,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,that particular business?”
7950,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7951,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Not much, I’m afraid,” said Pole, “except that glass is expensive, and"
7952,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,one’s man always sells the cut flowers.”
7953,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7954,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“Then you _do_ know something about it. It is. Bert was the old man’s
7955,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"only son, an’--_I_ don’t blame him--he’d done his damnedest to get"
7956,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"exempted--for the sake of the business, you understand. But he caught"
7957,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,it all right. The tribunal wasn’t takin’ any the day he went up. Bert
7958,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"was for it, with a few remarks from the patriotic old was-sers on the"
7959,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,bench. Our county paper had ’em all.”
7960,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7961,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“That’s the thing that made one really want the Hun in England for a
7962,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"week or two,” said Pole."
7963,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7964,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“_Mwor osee!_ The same tribunal, havin’ copped Bert, gave unconditional"
7965,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"exemption to the opposition shop--a man called Margetts, in the"
7966,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"market-garden business, which he’d established _since_ the war, with"
7967,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"his two sons who, every one in the village knew, had been pushed into"
7968,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,the business to save their damned hides. But Margetts had a good
7969,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,lawyer to advise him. The whole case was frank and above-board to a
7970,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,degree--our county paper had it all in too. Agricultural produce--vital
7971,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,necessity; the plough mightier than the sword; an’ those ducks on the
7972,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"bench, who had turned down Bert, noddin’ and smilin’ at Margetts all"
7973,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,full of his cabbage and green peas. What happened? The usual. Vigors’
7974,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"business--he’s sixty-eight, with asthma--goes smash, and Margetts and"
7975,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"Co. double theirs. So, then, that was Bert’s grievance, an’ he joined"
7976,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,us full of it. That’s why they called him ‘The Grief.’ Knowing the
7977,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"facts, I was with him; but being his sergeant, I had to check him,"
7978,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"because grievances are catchin’, and three or four men with ’em make"
7979,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,Companies--er--sticky. Luckily Bert wasn’t handy with his pen. He had
7980,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"to cork up his grievance mostly till he came across Hickmot, an’ Gord"
7981,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,in Heaven knows what brought those two together. No! _As_ y’were. I’m
7982,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,wrong about God! I always am. It was Sheep. Bert knew’s much about
7983,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,sheep as I do--an’ that’s Canterbury lamb--but he’d let Hickmot talk
7984,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"about ’em for hours, in return for Hickmot listenin’ to his grievance."
7985,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,Hickmot ’ud talk sheep--the one created thing he’d ever open up on--an’
7986,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,Bert ’ud talk his grievance while they was waiting to go over the top.
7987,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"I’ve heard ’em again an’ again, and, of course, I encouraged ’em. Now,"
7988,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,look here! Hickmot hadn’t seen an English house or a field or a road
7989,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,or--or anything any civ’lised man is used to in all his life! Sheep an’
7990,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,blacks! Market-gardens an’ glass an’ exemption-tribunals! An’ the men’s
7991,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"teeth chatterin’ behind their masks between rum-issue an’ zero. Oh,"
7992,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"there was fun in Hell those days, wasn’t there, boys?”"
7993,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7994,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Sure! Oh, sure!” Orton chuckled, and Pole echoed him."
7995,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
7996,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“Look here! When we were lying up somewhere among those forsaken
7997,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"chicken-camps back o’ Doullens, I found Hickmot making mud-pies in"
7998,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,a farmyard an’ Bert lookin’ on. He’d made a model of our village
7999,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,according to Bert’s description of it. He’d preserved it in his head
8000,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,through all those weeks an’ weeks o’ Bert’s yap; an’ he’d coughed it
8001,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"all up--Margetts’ house and gardens, old Mr. Vigors’ ditto; both pubs;"
8002,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"my father’s shop, everything that he’d been told by Bert done out to"
8003,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"scale in mud, with bits o’ brick and stick. Haig ought to have seen it;"
8004,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,but as his sergeant I had to check him for misusin’ his winkle-pin on
8005,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"dirt. ’Come to think of it, a man who runs about uninhabited countries,"
8006,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"with sheep, for a livin’ must have gifts for mappin’ and scalin’"
8007,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"things somehow or other, or he’d be dead. _I_ never saw anything like"
8008,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,it--_all_ out o’ what Bert had told him by word of mouth. An’ the next
8009,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,time we went up the line Hickmot copped it in the leg just in front of
8010,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,me.”
8011,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8012,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“Finish?” I asked.
8013,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8014,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Oh, no. Only beginnin’. That was in December, somethin’ or other,"
8015,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,’16. In Jan’ry Vigors copped it for keeps. I buried him--snowin’ blind
8016,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,it was--an’ before we’d got him under the whole show was crumped. I
8017,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,wanted to bury him again just to spite ’em (I’m a spiteful man by
8018,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"nature), but the party wasn’t takin’ any more--even if they could have"
8019,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"found it. But, you see, we had buried him all right, which is what"
8020,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"they want at home, and I wrote the usual trimmin’s about the chaplain"
8021,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"an’ the full service, an’ what his captain had said about Bert bein’"
8022,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"recommended for a pip, an’ the irreparable loss an’ so on. That was in"
8023,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,Jan’ry ’17. In Feb’ry some time or other I got saved. My speciality
8024,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,had come to be bombin’s and night-doings. Very pleasant for a young
8025,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"free man, but--there’s a limit to what you can stand. It takes all men"
8026,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"differently. Noise was what started me, at last. I’d got just up to the"
8027,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,edge--wonderin’ when I’d crack an’ how many of our men I’d do in if it
8028,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,came on me while we were busy. I had that nice taste in the mouth and
8029,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"the nice temperature they call trench-fever, an’--I had to feel inside"
8030,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,my head for the meanin’ of every order I gave or was responsible for
8031,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,executin’. _You_ know!”
8032,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8033,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“We do. Go on!” said Pole in a tone that made Orton look at him.
8034,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8035,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“So, you see, the bettin’ was even on my drawin’ a V. C. or getting"
8036,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,Number Umpty rest-camp or--a firing party before breakfast. But Gord
8037,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,saved me. (I made friends with Him the last two years of the war. The
8038,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,others went off too quick.) They wanted a bombin’-instructor for the
8039,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"training-battalion at home, an’ He put it into their silly hearts to"
8040,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,indent for me. It took ’em five minutes to make me understand I was
8041,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"saved. Then I vomited, an’ then I cried. _You_ know!” The fat face of"
8042,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"Bevin had changed and grown drawn, even as he spoke; and his hands"
8043,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,tugged as though to tighten an imaginary belt.
8044,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8045,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“I was never keen on bombin’ myself,” said Pole. “But"
8046,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,bombin’-instruction’s murder!”
8047,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8048,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“I don’t deny it’s a shade risky, specially when they take the pin"
8049,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"out an’ start shakin’ it, same as the Chinks used to do in the woods"
8050,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"at Beauty, when they were cuttin’ ’em down. But you live like a home"
8051,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"defence Brigadier, besides week-end leaf. As a matter o’ fact, I"
8052,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"married Bert’s sister soon’s I could after I got the billet, an’ I used"
8053,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,to lie in our bed thinkin’ of the old crowd on the Somme an’--feelin’
8054,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"what a swine I was. Of course, I earned two V. C.’s a week behind the"
8055,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"traverse in the exercise of my ord’nary duties, but that isn’t the"
8056,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,same thing. An’ yet I’d only joined up because--because I couldn’t dam’
8057,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,well help it.”
8058,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8059,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“An’ what about your Queenslander?” the Australian asked.
8060,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8061,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“_Too de sweet! Pronto!_ We got a letter in May from a Brighton
8062,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"hospital matron, sayin’ that one of the name of Hickmer was anxious for"
8063,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"news o’ me, previous to proceedin’ to Roehampton for initiation into"
8064,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"his new leg. Of course, we applied for him by return. Bert had written"
8065,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,about him to his sister--my missus--every time he wrote at all; an’
8066,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"any pal o’ Bert’s--well, _you_ know what the ladies are like. I warned"
8067,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,her about his peculiarities. She wouldn’t believe till she saw him. He
8068,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,was just the same. You’d ha’ thought he’d show up in England like a
8069,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,fresh stiff on snow--but you never noticed him. You never heard him;
8070,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,and if he didn’t want to be seen he wasn’t there. He just joined up
8071,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"with his background. I knew he could do that with men; but how in Hell,"
8072,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"seein’ how curious women are, he could camouflage with the ladies--my"
8073,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,wife an’ my mother to wit--beats _me_! He’d feed the chickens for us;
8074,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,he’d stand on his one leg--it was off above the knee--and saw wood for
8075,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,us. He’d run--I mean he’d hop--errands for Mrs. B. or mother; our dog
8076,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"worshipped him from the start, though I never saw him throw a word"
8077,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,to him; and--_yet_ he didn’t take any place anywhere. You’ve seen a
8078,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,rabbit--you’ve seen a pheasant--hidin’ in a ditch? ’Put your hand on it
8079,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"sometimes before it moved, haven’t you? Well, that was Hickmot--with"
8080,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,two women in the house crazy to find out--find out--anything about him
8081,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,that made him human. _You_ know what women are! He stayed with us a
8082,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,fortnight. He left us on a Sat’day to go to Roehampton to try his leg.
8083,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"On Friday he came over to the bombin’ ground--not sayin’ anything,"
8084,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"_as_ usual--to watch me instruct my Suicide Club, which was only half"
8085,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"an hour’s run by rail from our village. He had his overcoat on, an’"
8086,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"as soon as he reached the place it was _mafeesh_ with him, as usual."
8087,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,Rabbit-trick again! You never noticed him. He sat in the bomb-proof
8088,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,behind the pit where the duds accumulate till it’s time to explode ’em.
8089,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"Naturally, that’s strictly forbidden to the public. So he went there,"
8090,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"an’ no one noticed him. When he’d had enough of watchin’, he hopped off"
8091,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,home to feed our chickens for the last time.”
8092,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8093,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“Then how did _you_ know all about it?” Orton said.
8094,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8095,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“Because I saw him come into the place just as I was goin’ down into
8096,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,the trench. Then he slipped my memory till my train went back. But it
8097,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,would have made no difference what our arrangements were. If Hickmer
8098,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"didn’t choose to be noticed, he _wasn’t_ noticed. Just for curiosity’s"
8099,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,sake I asked some o’ the Staff Sergeants whether they’d seen him on
8100,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,the ground. Not one--not one single one had--or could tell me what
8101,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,he was like. An’ Sat’day noon he went off to Roehampton. We saw him
8102,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"into the train ourselves, with the lunch Mrs. B. had put up for him--a"
8103,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"one-legged man an’ his crutch, in regulation blue, khaki warm an’"
8104,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"kit-bag. Takin’ everything together, per’aps he’d spoken as many as"
8105,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,twenty times in the thirteen days he’d been with us. I’m givin’ it you
8106,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,straight as it happened. An’ now--look here!--this is what _did_ happen.
8107,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8108,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“Between two and three that Sunday morning--dark an’ blowin’ from the
8109,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,north--I was woke up by an explosion an’ people shoutin’ ‘Raid!’ The
8110,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,first bang fetched ’em out like worms after rain. There was another
8111,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"some minutes afterwards, an’ me an’ a Sergeant in the Shropshires on"
8112,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,leaf told ’em all to take cover. They did. There was a devil of a
8113,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"long wait an’ there was a third pop. Everybody, includin’ me, heard"
8114,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,aeroplanes. I didn’t notice till afterwards that----”
8115,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8116,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,Bevin paused.
8117,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8118,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“What?” said Orton.
8119,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8120,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Oh, I noticed a heap of things afterwards. What we noticed first--the"
8121,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,Shropshire Sergeant an’ me--was a rick well alight back o’ Margetts’
8122,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"house, an’, with that north wind, blowin’ straight on to another"
8123,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,rick o’ Margetts’. It went up all of a whoosh. The next thing we saw
8124,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,by the light of it was Margetts’ house with a bomb-hole in the roof
8125,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,and the rafters leanin’ sideways like--like they always lean on such
8126,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"occasions. So we ran there, and the first thing we met was Margetts in"
8127,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,his split-tailed nightie callin’ on his mother an’ damnin’ his wife. A
8128,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,man always does that when he’s cross. Have you noticed? Mrs. Margetts
8129,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"was in her nightie too, remindin’ Margetts that he hadn’t completed"
8130,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,his rick insurance. An’ that’s a woman’s lovin’ care all over. Behind
8131,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"them was their eldest son, in trousers an’ slippers, nursin’ his"
8132,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,arm an’ callin’ for the doctor. They went through us howlin’ like
8133,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,_flammenwerfer_ casualties--right up the street to the surgery.
8134,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8135,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Well, there wasn’t anything to do except let the show burn out. We"
8136,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,hadn’t any means of extinguishing conflagrations. Some of ’em fiddled
8137,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"with buckets, an’ some of ’em tried to get out some o’ Margetts’"
8138,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"sticks, but his younger son kept shoutin’, ‘Don’t! Don’t! It’ll be"
8139,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"stole! It’ll be stole!’ So it burned instead, till the roof came down"
8140,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"top of all--a little, cheap, dirty villa. In _reel_ life one whizbang"
8141,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,would have shifted it; but in our civil village it looked that damned
8142,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,important and particular you wouldn’t believe. We couldn’t get round
8143,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"to Margetts’ stable because of the two ricks alight, but we found"
8144,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,some one had opened the door early an’ the horses was in Margetts’
8145,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,new vegetable piece down the hill which he’d hired off old Vigors
8146,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,to extend his business with. I love the way a horse always looks
8147,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,after his own belly--same as a Gunner. They went to grazin’ down the
8148,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"carrots and onions till young Margetts ran to turn ’em out, an’ then"
8149,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"they got in among the glass frames an’ cut themselves. Oh, we had a"
8150,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"regular Russian night of it, everybody givin’ advice an’ fallin’ over"
8151,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"each other. When it got light we saw the damage. House, two ricks an’"
8152,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,stable _mafeesh_; the big glasshouse with every pane smashed and the
8153,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,furnace-end of it blown clean out. All the horses an’ about fifteen
8154,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,head o’ cattle--butcher’s stores from the next field--feeding in the
8155,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"new vegetable piece. It was a fair clean-up from end to end--house,"
8156,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"furniture, fittin’s, plant, an’ all the early crops.”"
8157,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8158,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“Was there any other damage in the village?” I asked.
8159,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8160,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“I’m coming to it--the curious part--but I wouldn’t call it damage. I
8161,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,was renting a field then for my chickens off the Merecroft Estate. It’s
8162,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"accommodation-land, an’ there was a wet ditch at the bottom that I had"
8163,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,wanted for ever so long to dam up to make a swim-hole for Mrs. Bevin’s
8164,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,ducks.”
8165,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8166,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Ah!” said Orton, half turning in his chair, all in one piece."
8167,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8168,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“S’pose I was allowed? Not me. Their Agent came down on me for
8169,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,tamperin’ with the Estate’s drainage arrangements. An’ all I wanted was
8170,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,to bring the bank down where the ditch narrows--a couple of cartloads
8171,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,of dirt would have held the water back for half a dozen yards--not more
8172,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"than that, an’ I could have made a little spillway over the top with"
8173,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"three boards--same as in trenches. Well, the first bomb--the one that"
8174,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,woke me up--had done my work for me better than I could. It had dropped
8175,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,just under the hollow of the bank an’ brought it all down in a fair
8176,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"landslide. I’d got my swim-hole for Mrs. Bevin’s ducks, an’ I didn’t"
8177,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"see how the Estate could kick at the Act o’ God, d’you?”"
8178,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8179,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“And Hickmot?” said Orton, grinning."
8180,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8181,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Hold on! There was a Parish Council meetin’ to demand reprisals, of"
8182,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"course, an’ there was the policeman an’ me pokin’ about among the ruins"
8183,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,till the Explosives Expert came down in his motor car at three P.M.
8184,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"Monday, an’ he meets all the Margetts off their rockers, howlin’ in the"
8185,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"surgery, an’ he sees my swim-hole fillin’ up to the brim.”"
8186,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8187,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“What did he say?” Pole inquired.
8188,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8189,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“He sized it up at once. (He had to get back to dine in town that
8190,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,evening.) He said all the evidence proved that it was a lucky shot
8191,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"on the part of one isolated Hun ’plane goin’ home, an’ we weren’t to"
8192,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,take it to heart. I don’t know that anybody but the Margetts did. He
8193,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,said they must have used incendiary bombs of a new type--which he’d
8194,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,suspected for a long time. I don’t think the man was any worse than
8195,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,God intended him to be. I don’t _reelly_. But the Shropshire Sergeant
8196,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,said----”
8197,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8198,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“And what did _you_ think?” I interrupted.
8199,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8200,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“I didn’t think. I knew by then. I’m not a Sherlock Holmes; but havin’
8201,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,chucked ’em an’ chucked ’em back and kicked ’em out of the light an’
8202,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"slept with ’em for two years, an’ makin’ my livin’ out of them at"
8203,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"that time, I could recognise the fuse of a Mills bomb when I found"
8204,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,it. I found all three of ’em. ’Curious about that second in Margetts’
8205,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"glasshouse. Hickmot mus’ have raked the ashes out of the furnace,"
8206,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"popped it in, an’ shut the furnace door. It operated all right. Not"
8207,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"one livin’ pane left in the putty, and all the brickwork spread round"
8208,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,the yard in streaks. Just like that St. Firmin village we were talking
8209,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,about.”
8210,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8211,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“But how d’you account for young what’s-his-name gettin’ his arm
8212,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,broken?” said Pole.
8213,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8214,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Crutch!” said Bevin. “If you or me had taken on that night’s doin’s,"
8215,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"with one leg, we’d have hopped and sweated from one flank to another"
8216,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,an’ been caught half-way between. Hickmot didn’t. I’m as sure as I’m
8217,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,sittin’ here that he did his doings quiet and comfortable at his full
8218,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,height--he was over six feet--and no one noticed him. This is the way
8219,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,_I_ see it. He fixed the swim-hole for Mrs. Bevin’s ducks first. We
8220,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"used to talk over our own affairs in front of him, of course, and he"
8221,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,knew just what she wanted in the way of a pond. So he went and made
8222,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,it at his leisure. Then he prob’ly went over to Margetts’ and lit the
8223,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"first rick, knowin’ that the wind ’ud do the rest. When young Margetts"
8224,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"saw the light of it an’ came out to look, Hickmot would have taken post"
8225,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"at the back-door an’ dropped the young swine with his crutch, same as"
8226,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,we used to drop Huns comin’ out of a dug-out. _You_ know how they blink
8227,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,at the light? Then he must have walked off an’ opened Margetts’ stable
8228,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,door to save the horses. They’d be more to him than any man’s life.
8229,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"Then he prob’ly chucked one bomb on top o’ Margetts’ roof, havin’ seen"
8230,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,that the first rick had caught the second and that the whole house was
8231,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,bound to go. D’you get me?”
8232,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8233,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“Then why did he waste his bomb on the house?” said Orton. His glass
8234,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,eye seemed as triumphant as his real one.
8235,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8236,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“For camouflage, of course. He was camouflagin’ an air-raid. When"
8237,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"the Margetts piled out of their place into the street, he prob’ly"
8238,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"attended to the glasshouse, because that would be Margetts’ chief means"
8239,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"o’ business. After that--I think so, because otherwise I don’t see"
8240,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,where all those extra cattle came from that we found in the vegetable
8241,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,piece--he must have walked off an’ rounded up all the butcher’s beasts
8242,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"in the next medder, an’ driven ’em there to help the horses. And when"
8243,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"he’d finished everything he’d set out to do, I’ll lay my life an’ kit"
8244,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,he curled up like a bloomin’ wombat not fifty yards away from the whole
8245,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,flamin’ show--an’ let us run round him. An’ when he’d had his sleep
8246,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"out, he went up to Roehampton Monday mornin’ by some train that he’d"
8247,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,decided upon in his own mind weeks an’ weeks before.”
8248,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8249,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“Did he know all the trains then?” said Pole.
8250,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8251,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“Ask me another. I only know that if he wanted to get from any place to
8252,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"another without bein’ noticed, he did it.”"
8253,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8254,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“And the bombs? He got ’em from you, of course,” Pole went on."
8255,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8256,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“What do _you_ think? He was an hour in the park watchin’ me instruct,"
8257,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"sittin’, as I remember, in the bomb-proof by the dud-hole, in his"
8258,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,overcoat. He got ’em all right. He took neither more nor less than he
8259,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,wanted; an’ I’ve told you what he did with ’em--one--two--_an’_ three.”
8260,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8261,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“’Ever see him afterwards?” said Orton.
8262,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8263,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Yes. ’Saw him at Brighton when I went down there with the missus, not"
8264,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,a month after he’d been broken in to his Roehampton leg. You know how
8265,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"the boys used to sit all along Brighton front in their blues, an’ jump"
8266,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,every time the coal was bein’ delivered to the hotels behind them?
8267,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"I barged into him opposite the Old Ship, an’ I told him about our"
8268,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,air-raid. I told him how Margetts had gone off his rocker an’ walked
8269,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,about starin’ at the sky an’ holdin’ reprisal-meetin’s all by himself;
8270,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,an’ how old Mr. Vigors had bought in what he’d left--tho’ of course I
8271,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,said what _was_ left--o’ Margetts’ business; an’ how well my swim-hole
8272,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,for the ducks was doin’. It didn’t interest him. He didn’t want to come
8273,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"over to stay with us any more, either. We were a long, long way back in"
8274,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"his past. You could see that. He wanted to get back with his new leg,"
8275,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,to his own God-forsaken sheep-walk an’ his black fellers in Queensland.
8276,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"I expect he’s done it now, an’ no one has noticed him. But, by Gord! He"
8277,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,_did_ leak a little at the end. He did that much! When we was waitin’
8278,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"for the tram to the station, I said how grateful I was to Fritz for"
8279,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,moppin’ up Margetts an’ makin’ our swim-hole all in one night. Mrs. B.
8280,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"seconded the motion. We couldn’t have done less. Well, then Hickmot"
8281,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"said, speakin’ in his queer way, as if English words were all new to"
8282,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"him: ‘Ah, go on an’ bail up in Hell,’ he says. ‘Bert was my friend.’"
8283,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"That was all. I’ve given it you just as it happened, word for word."
8284,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,_I_’d hate to have an Australian have it in for _me_ for anything I’d
8285,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"done to _his_ friend. Mark _you_, I don’t say there’s anything _wrong_"
8286,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"with you Australians, Brother Orton. I only say they ain’t like us or"
8287,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,any one else that I know.”
8288,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8289,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Well, do you want us to be?” said Orton."
8290,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8291,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“No, no. It takes all sorts to make a world, as the sayin’ is. And"
8292,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,now”--Bevin pulled out his gold watch--“if I don’t make a move of it
8293,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,I’ll miss my last train.”
8294,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8295,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Let her go,” said Orton serenely. “You’ve done some lorry-hoppin’ in"
8296,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"your time, haven’t you--Sergeant?”"
8297,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8298,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“When I was two an’ a half stone lighter, Digger,” Bevin smiled in"
8299,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,reply.
8300,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8301,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"“Well, I’ll run you out home before sun-up. I’m a haulage-contractor"
8302,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,now--London and Oxford. There’s an empty of mine ordered to Oxford.
8303,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,We can go round by your place as easy as not. She’s lyin’ out
8304,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,Vauxhall-way.”
8305,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,
8306,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,“My Gord! An’ see the sun rise again! ’Haven’t seen him since I can’t
8307,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"remember when,” said Bevin, chuckling. “Oh, there was fun sometimes"
8308,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,"in Hell, wasn’t there, Australia?”; and again his hands went down to"
8309,A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY,tighten the belt that was missing.

8367,ON THE GATE,A Tale of ’16

8373,ON THE GATE,
8374,ON THE GATE,A Tale of ’16
8375,ON THE GATE,
8376,ON THE GATE,
8377,ON THE GATE,If the Order Above be but the reflection of the Order Below (as that
8378,ON THE GATE,"Ancient affirms, who had some knowledge of the Order) it is not outside"
8379,ON THE GATE,the Order of Things that there should have been confusion also in the
8380,ON THE GATE,"Department of Death. The world’s steadily falling death-rate, the"
8381,ON THE GATE,"rising proportion of scientifically prolonged fatal illnesses, which"
8382,ON THE GATE,"allowed months of warning to all concerned, had weakened initiative"
8383,ON THE GATE,"throughout the Necrological Departments. When the War came, these were"
8384,ON THE GATE,"as unprepared as civilised mankind; and, like mankind, they improvised"
8385,ON THE GATE,and recriminated in the face of Heaven.
8386,ON THE GATE,
8387,ON THE GATE,As Death himself observed to St. Peter who had just come off The Gate
8388,ON THE GATE,for a rest: “One does the best one can with the means at one’s disposal
8389,ON THE GATE,but----”
8390,ON THE GATE,
8391,ON THE GATE,"“_I_ know,” said the good Saint sympathetically. “Even with what help I"
8392,ON THE GATE,"can muster, I’m on The Gate twenty-two hours out of the twenty-four.”"
8393,ON THE GATE,
8394,ON THE GATE,“Do you find your volunteer staff any real use?” Death went on. “Isn’t
8395,ON THE GATE,it easier to do the work oneself than----”
8396,ON THE GATE,
8397,ON THE GATE,"“One must guard against that point of view,” St. Peter returned, “but I"
8398,ON THE GATE,know what you mean. Office officialises the best of us.... What is it
8399,ON THE GATE,_now_?” He turned to a prim-lipped Seraph who had followed him with an
8400,ON THE GATE,expulsion-form for signature. St. Peter glanced it over. “Private R.
8401,ON THE GATE,"M. Buckland,” he read, “on the charge of saying that there is no God."
8402,ON THE GATE,’That all?”
8403,ON THE GATE,
8404,ON THE GATE,"“He says he is prepared to prove it, sir, and--according to the"
8405,ON THE GATE,Rules----”
8406,ON THE GATE,
8407,ON THE GATE,"“If you will make yourself acquainted with the Rules, you’ll find they"
8408,ON THE GATE,"lay down that ‘the fool says in his heart, there is no God.’ That"
8409,ON THE GATE,decides it; probably shell-shock. Have you tested his reflexes?”
8410,ON THE GATE,
8411,ON THE GATE,"“No, sir. He kept _on_ saying that there----”"
8412,ON THE GATE,
8413,ON THE GATE,“Pass him in at once! Tell off some one to argue with him and give him
8414,ON THE GATE,the best of the argument till St. Luke’s free. Anything else?”
8415,ON THE GATE,
8416,ON THE GATE,"“A hospital-nurse’s record, sir. She has been nursing for two years.”"
8417,ON THE GATE,
8418,ON THE GATE,"“A long while,” St. Peter spoke severely. “She may very well have grown"
8419,ON THE GATE,careless.”
8420,ON THE GATE,
8421,ON THE GATE,"“It’s her civilian record, sir. I judged best to refer it to you.” The"
8422,ON THE GATE,Seraph handed him a vivid scarlet docket.
8423,ON THE GATE,
8424,ON THE GATE,"“The next time,” said St. Peter folding it down and writing on one"
8425,ON THE GATE,"corner, “that you get one of these--er--tinted forms, mark it Q.M.A."
8426,ON THE GATE,and pass bearer at once. Don’t worry over trifles.” The Seraph flashed
8427,ON THE GATE,off and returned to the clamorous Gate.
8428,ON THE GATE,
8429,ON THE GATE,“Which Department is Q.M.A.?” said Death. St. Peter chuckled.
8430,ON THE GATE,
8431,ON THE GATE,“It’s not a department. It’s a Ruling. ‘_Quia multum amavit._’ A most
8432,ON THE GATE,"useful Ruling. I’ve stretched it to.... Now, I wonder what that child"
8433,ON THE GATE,actually did die of.”
8434,ON THE GATE,
8435,ON THE GATE,"“I’ll ask,” said Death, and moved to a public telephone near by."
8436,ON THE GATE,"“Give me War Check and Audit: English side: non-combatant,” he began."
8437,ON THE GATE,“Latest returns.... Surely you’ve got them posted up to date by now!...
8438,ON THE GATE,Yes! Hospital Nurse in France.... No! _Not_ ‘nature and aliases.’ I
8439,ON THE GATE,said--what--was--nature--of--illness?... Thanks.” He turned to St.
8440,ON THE GATE,"Peter. “Quite normal,” he said. “Heart-failure after neglected pleurisy"
8441,ON THE GATE,following overwork.”
8442,ON THE GATE,
8443,ON THE GATE,“Good!” St. Peter rubbed his hands. “That brings her under the higher
8444,ON THE GATE,allowance--G.L.H. scale--‘Greater love hath no man--’ But _my_ people
8445,ON THE GATE,ought to have known that from the first.”
8446,ON THE GATE,
8447,ON THE GATE,“Who is that clerk of yours?” asked Death. “He seems rather a stickler
8448,ON THE GATE,for the proprieties.”
8449,ON THE GATE,
8450,ON THE GATE,"“The usual type nowadays,” St. Peter returned. “A young Power in charge"
8451,ON THE GATE,"of some half-baked Universe. Never having dealt with life yet, he’s"
8452,ON THE GATE,somewhat nebulous.”
8453,ON THE GATE,
8454,ON THE GATE,Death sighed. “It’s the same with my old Departmental Heads. Nothing on
8455,ON THE GATE,earth will make my fossils on the Normal Civil Side realise that we are
8456,ON THE GATE,dying in a new age. Come and look at them. They might interest you.”
8457,ON THE GATE,
8458,ON THE GATE,"“Thanks, I will, but----Excuse me a minute! Here’s my zealous young"
8459,ON THE GATE,assistant on the wing once more.”
8460,ON THE GATE,
8461,ON THE GATE,The Seraph had returned to report the arrival of overwhelmingly heavy
8462,ON THE GATE,"convoys at The Gate, and to ask what the Saint advised."
8463,ON THE GATE,
8464,ON THE GATE,“I’m just off on an inter-departmental inspection which will take
8465,ON THE GATE,"me some time,” said St. Peter. “You _must_ learn to act on your own"
8466,ON THE GATE,"initiative. So I shall leave you to yourself for the next hour or two,"
8467,ON THE GATE,merely suggesting (I don’t wish in any way to sway your judgment)
8468,ON THE GATE,"that you invite St. Paul, St. Ignatius (Loyola, I mean) and--er--St."
8469,ON THE GATE,Christopher to assist as Supervising Assessors on the Board of
8470,ON THE GATE,"Admission. Ignatius is one of the subtlest intellects we have, and"
8471,ON THE GATE,"an officer and a gentleman to boot. I assure you,” the Saint turned"
8472,ON THE GATE,"towards Death, “he revels in dialectics. If he’s allowed to prove his"
8473,ON THE GATE,"case, he’s quite capable of letting off the offender. St. Christopher,"
8474,ON THE GATE,"of course, will pass anything that looks wet and muddy.”"
8475,ON THE GATE,
8476,ON THE GATE,"“They are nearly all that now, sir,” said the Seraph."
8477,ON THE GATE,
8478,ON THE GATE,“So much the better; and--as I was going to say--St. Paul is an
8479,ON THE GATE,embarrass--a distinctly strong colleague. Still--we all have our
8480,ON THE GATE,weaknesses. Perhaps a well-timed reference to his seamanship in the
8481,ON THE GATE,"Mediterranean--by the way, look up the name of his ship, will you?"
8482,ON THE GATE,"Alexandria register, I think--might be useful in some of those sudden"
8483,ON THE GATE,"maritime cases that crop up. I needn’t tell _you_ to be firm, of"
8484,ON THE GATE,course. That’s your besetting--er--I mean--reprimand ’em severely and
8485,ON THE GATE,"publicly, but--” the Saint’s voice broke--“oh, my child, _you_ don’t"
8486,ON THE GATE,know what it is to need forgiveness. Be gentle with ’em--be very gentle
8487,ON THE GATE,with ’em!”
8488,ON THE GATE,
8489,ON THE GATE,Swiftly as a falling shaft of light the Seraph kissed the sandalled
8490,ON THE GATE,feet and was away.
8491,ON THE GATE,
8492,ON THE GATE,“Aha!” said St. Peter. “He can’t go far wrong with that Board of
8493,ON THE GATE,Admission as I’ve--er--arranged it.”
8494,ON THE GATE,
8495,ON THE GATE,"They walked towards the great central office of Normal Civil Death,"
8496,ON THE GATE,"which, buried to the knees in a flood of temporary structures,"
8497,ON THE GATE,resembled a closed cribbage-board among spilt dominoes.
8498,ON THE GATE,
8499,ON THE GATE,"They entered an area of avenues and cross-avenues, flanked by long, low"
8500,ON THE GATE,"buildings, each packed with seraphs working wing to folded wing."
8501,ON THE GATE,
8502,ON THE GATE,"“Our temporary buildings,” Death explained. “’Always being added to."
8503,ON THE GATE,This is the War-side. You’ll find nothing changed on the Normal Civil
8504,ON THE GATE,Side. They are more human than mankind.”
8505,ON THE GATE,
8506,ON THE GATE,"“It doesn’t lie in _my_ mouth to blame them,” said St. Peter."
8507,ON THE GATE,
8508,ON THE GATE,"“No, I’ve yet to meet the soul you wouldn’t find excuse for,” said"
8509,ON THE GATE,Death tenderly; “but then _I_ don’t--er--arrange my Boards of
8510,ON THE GATE,Admission.”
8511,ON THE GATE,
8512,ON THE GATE,"“If one doesn’t help one’s Staff, one’s Staff will never help itself,”"
8513,ON THE GATE,"St. Peter laughed, as the shadow of the main porch of the Normal Civil"
8514,ON THE GATE,Death Offices darkened above them.
8515,ON THE GATE,
8516,ON THE GATE,"“This façade rather recalls the Vatican, doesn’t it?” said the Saint."
8517,ON THE GATE,
8518,ON THE GATE,“They’re quite as conservative. ’Notice how they still keep the old
8519,ON THE GATE,"Holbein uniforms? ’Morning, Sergeant Fell. How goes it?” said Death as"
8520,ON THE GATE,"he swung the dusty doors and nodded at a Commissionaire, clad in the"
8521,ON THE GATE,"grim livery of Death, even as Hans Holbein has designed it."
8522,ON THE GATE,
8523,ON THE GATE,"“Sadly. Very sadly indeed, sir,” the Commissionaire replied. “So many"
8524,ON THE GATE,"pore ladies and gentlemen, sir, ’oo might well ’ave lived another few"
8525,ON THE GATE,"years, goin’ off as you might say, in every direction with no time for"
8526,ON THE GATE,the proper obsequities.”
8527,ON THE GATE,
8528,ON THE GATE,"“Too bad,” said Death sympathetically. “Well, we’re none of us as young"
8529,ON THE GATE,"as we were, Sergeant.”"
8530,ON THE GATE,
8531,ON THE GATE,"They climbed a carved staircase, behung with the whole millinery of"
8532,ON THE GATE,undertaking at large. Death halted on a dark Aberdeen granite landing
8533,ON THE GATE,and beckoned a messenger.
8534,ON THE GATE,
8535,ON THE GATE,"“We’re rather busy to-day, sir,” the messenger whispered, “but I think"
8536,ON THE GATE,His Majesty will see _you_.”
8537,ON THE GATE,
8538,ON THE GATE,“Who _is_ the Head of this Department if it isn’t you?” St. Peter
8539,ON THE GATE,whispered in turn.
8540,ON THE GATE,
8541,ON THE GATE,"“You may well ask,” his companion replied. “I’m only--” he checked"
8542,ON THE GATE,"himself and went on. “The fact is, our Normal Civil Death side is"
8543,ON THE GATE,controlled by a Being who considers himself all that I am and more.
8544,ON THE GATE,He’s Death as men have made him--in their own image.” He pointed to
8545,ON THE GATE,"a brazen plate, by the side of a black-curtained door, which read:"
8546,ON THE GATE,"“Normal Civil Death, K.G., K.T., K.P., P.C., etc.” “He’s as human as"
8547,ON THE GATE,mankind.”
8548,ON THE GATE,
8549,ON THE GATE,“I guessed as much from those letters. What do they mean?”
8550,ON THE GATE,
8551,ON THE GATE,“Titles conferred on him from time to time. King of Ghosts; King of
8552,ON THE GATE,"Terrors; King of Phantoms; Pallid Conqueror, and so forth. There’s no"
8553,ON THE GATE,"denying he’s earned every one of them. A first-class mind, but just a"
8554,ON THE GATE,leetle bit of a sn----”
8555,ON THE GATE,
8556,ON THE GATE,"“His Majesty is at liberty,” said the messenger."
8557,ON THE GATE,
8558,ON THE GATE,Civil Death did not belie his name. No monarch on earth could have
8559,ON THE GATE,"welcomed them more graciously; or, in St. Peter’s case, with more of"
8560,ON THE GATE,that particularity of remembrance which is the gift of good kings. But
8561,ON THE GATE,"when Death asked him how his office was working, he became at once the"
8562,ON THE GATE,Departmental Head with a grievance.
8563,ON THE GATE,
8564,ON THE GATE,"“Thanks to this abominable War,” he began testily, “my N.C.D. has to"
8565,ON THE GATE,spend all its time fighting for mere existence. Your new War-side seems
8566,ON THE GATE,to think that nothing matters _except_ the war. I’ve been asked to
8567,ON THE GATE,give up two-thirds of my Archives Basement (E. 7--E. 64) to the Polish
8568,ON THE GATE,Civilian Casualty Check and Audit. Preposterous! Where am I to move my
8569,ON THE GATE,"Archives? And they’ve just been cross-indexed, too!”"
8570,ON THE GATE,
8571,ON THE GATE,"“As I understood it,” said Death, “our War-side merely applied for"
8572,ON THE GATE,desk-room in your basement. They were prepared to leave your Archives
8573,ON THE GATE,_in situ_.”
8574,ON THE GATE,
8575,ON THE GATE,“Impossible! We may need to refer to them at any moment. There’s a
8576,ON THE GATE,case now which is interesting Us all--a Mrs. Ollerby. Worcestershire by
8577,ON THE GATE,"extraction--dying of an internal hereditary complaint. At any moment,"
8578,ON THE GATE,"We may wish to refer to her dossier, and how _can_ We if Our basement"
8579,ON THE GATE,is given up to people over whom We exercise no departmental control?
8580,ON THE GATE,This war has been made excuse for slackness in every direction.”
8581,ON THE GATE,
8582,ON THE GATE,“Indeed!” said Death. “You surprise me. I thought nothing made any
8583,ON THE GATE,difference to the N.C.D.”
8584,ON THE GATE,
8585,ON THE GATE,"“A few years ago I should have concurred,” Civil Death replied. “But"
8586,ON THE GATE,since this--this recent outbreak of unregulated mortality there
8587,ON THE GATE,has been a distinct lack of respect towards certain aspects of Our
8588,ON THE GATE,administration. The attitude is bound to reflect itself in the office.
8589,ON THE GATE,"The official is, in a large measure, what the public makes him. Of"
8590,ON THE GATE,"course, it is only temporary reaction, but the merest outsider would"
8591,ON THE GATE,notice what I mean. Perhaps _you_ would like to see for yourself?”
8592,ON THE GATE,"Civil Death bowed towards St. Peter, who feared that he might be taking"
8593,ON THE GATE,up his time.
8594,ON THE GATE,
8595,ON THE GATE,"“Not in the least. If I am not the servant of the public, what am I?”"
8596,ON THE GATE,"Civil Death said, and preceded them to the landing. “Now, this--”"
8597,ON THE GATE,he ushered them into an immense but badly lighted office--“is our
8598,ON THE GATE,International Mortuary Department--the I.M.D. as we call it. It works
8599,ON THE GATE,with the Check and Audit. I should be sorry to say offhand how many
8600,ON THE GATE,"billion sterling it represents, invested in the funeral ceremonies of"
8601,ON THE GATE,all the races of mankind.” He stopped behind a very bald-headed clerk
8602,ON THE GATE,"at a desk. “And yet We take cognizance of the minutest detail, do not"
8603,ON THE GATE,"We?” he went on. “What have We here, for example?”"
8604,ON THE GATE,
8605,ON THE GATE,"“Funeral expenses of the late Mr. John Shenks Tanner,” the clerk"
8606,ON THE GATE,stepped aside from the red-ruled book. “Cut down by the executors on
8607,ON THE GATE,"account of the War from £173:19:1 to £47:18:4. A sad falling off, if I"
8608,ON THE GATE,"may say so, Your Majesty.”"
8609,ON THE GATE,
8610,ON THE GATE,“And what was the attitude of the survivors?” Civil Death asked.
8611,ON THE GATE,
8612,ON THE GATE,“Very casual. It was a motor-hearse funeral.”
8613,ON THE GATE,
8614,ON THE GATE,"“A pernicious example, spreading, I fear, even in the lowest classes,”"
8615,ON THE GATE,"his superior muttered. “Haste, lack of respect for the Dread Summons,"
8616,ON THE GATE,carelessness in the Subsequent Disposition of the Corpse and----”
8617,ON THE GATE,
8618,ON THE GATE,“But as regards people’s real feelings?” St. Peter demanded of the
8619,ON THE GATE,clerk.
8620,ON THE GATE,
8621,ON THE GATE,"“That isn’t within the terms of our reference, Sir,” was the answer."
8622,ON THE GATE,"“But we _do_ know that as often as not, they don’t even buy black-edged"
8623,ON THE GATE,announcement-cards nowadays.”
8624,ON THE GATE,
8625,ON THE GATE,“Good Heavens!” said Civil Death swellingly. “No cards! I must look
8626,ON THE GATE,"into this myself. Forgive me, St. Peter, but we Servants of Humanity,"
8627,ON THE GATE,"as you know, are not our own masters. No cards, indeed!” He waved them"
8628,ON THE GATE,"off with an official hand, and immersed himself in the ledger."
8629,ON THE GATE,
8630,ON THE GATE,"“Oh, come along,” Death whispered to St. Peter. “This is a blessed"
8631,ON THE GATE,relief!”
8632,ON THE GATE,
8633,ON THE GATE,They two walked on till they reached the far end of the vast dim
8634,ON THE GATE,office. The clerks at the desks here scarcely pretended to work. A
8635,ON THE GATE,messenger entered and slapped down a small autophonic reel.
8636,ON THE GATE,
8637,ON THE GATE,“Here you are!” he cried. “Mister Wilbraham Lattimer’s last dying
8638,ON THE GATE,speech and record. He made a shockin’ end of it.”
8639,ON THE GATE,
8640,ON THE GATE,“Good for Lattimer!” a young voice called from a desk. “Chuck it over!”
8641,ON THE GATE,
8642,ON THE GATE,"“Yes,” the messenger went on. “Lattimer said to his brother: ‘Bert, I"
8643,ON THE GATE,"haven’t time to worry about a little thing like dying these days, and"
8644,ON THE GATE,"what’s more important, _you_ haven’t either. You go back to your Somme"
8645,ON THE GATE,"doin’s, and I’ll put it through with Aunt Maria. It’ll amuse her and"
8646,ON THE GATE,it won’t hinder you.’ That’s nice stuff for your boss!” The messenger
8647,ON THE GATE,whistled and departed. A clerk groaned as he snatched up the reel.
8648,ON THE GATE,
8649,ON THE GATE,“How the deuce am I to knock this into official shape?” he began. “Pass
8650,ON THE GATE,"us the edifying Gantry Tubnell. I’ll have to crib from him again, I"
8651,ON THE GATE,suppose.”
8652,ON THE GATE,
8653,ON THE GATE,"“Be careful!” a companion whispered, and shuffled a typewritten form"
8654,ON THE GATE,along the desk. “I’ve used Tubby twice this morning already.”
8655,ON THE GATE,
8656,ON THE GATE,The late Mr. Gantry Tubnell must have demised on approved departmental
8657,ON THE GATE,"lines, for his record was much thumbed. Death and St. Peter watched the"
8658,ON THE GATE,editing with interest.
8659,ON THE GATE,
8660,ON THE GATE,"“I can’t bring in Aunt Maria _any_ way,” the clerk broke out at last."
8661,ON THE GATE,"“Listen here, every one! She has heart-disease. She dies just as she’s"
8662,ON THE GATE,"lifted the dropsical Lattimer to change his sheets. She says: ‘Sorry,"
8663,ON THE GATE,Willy! I’d make a dam’ pore ’ospital nurse!’ Then she sits down and
8664,ON THE GATE,croaks. Now _I_ call that good! I’ve a great mind to take it round to
8665,ON THE GATE,the War-side as an indirect casualty and get a breath of fresh air.”
8666,ON THE GATE,
8667,ON THE GATE,"“Then you’ll be hauled over the coals,” a neighbour suggested."
8668,ON THE GATE,
8669,ON THE GATE,"“I’m used to that, too,” the clerk sniggered."
8670,ON THE GATE,
8671,ON THE GATE,"“Are you?” said Death, stepping forward suddenly from behind a high"
8672,ON THE GATE,map-stand. “Who are you?” The clerk cowered in his skeleton jacket.
8673,ON THE GATE,
8674,ON THE GATE,"“I’m not on the Regular Establishment, Sir,” he stammered. “I’m"
8675,ON THE GATE,a--Volunteer. I--I wanted to see how people behaved when they were in
8676,ON THE GATE,trouble.”
8677,ON THE GATE,
8678,ON THE GATE,"“Did you? Well, take the late Mr. Wilbraham Lattimer’s and Miss Maria"
8679,ON THE GATE,Lattimer’s papers to the War-side General Reference Office. When they
8680,ON THE GATE,"have been passed upon, tell the Attendance Clerk that you are to serve"
8681,ON THE GATE,as probationer in--let’s see--in the Domestic Induced Casualty Side--7
8682,G.S.”,G.S.”
8683,G.S.”,
8684,G.S.”,The clerk collected himself a little and spoke through dry lips.
8685,G.S.”,
8686,G.S.”,"“But--but I’m--I slipped in from the Lower Establishment, Sir,” he"
8687,G.S.”,breathed.
8688,G.S.”,
8689,G.S.”,There was no need to explain. He shook from head to foot as with the
8690,G.S.”,palsy; and under all Heaven none tremble save those who come from that
8691,G.S.”,class which “also believe and tremble.”
8692,G.S.”,
8693,G.S.”,"“Do you tell Me this officially, or as one created being to another?”"
8694,G.S.”,Death asked after a pause.
8695,G.S.”,
8696,G.S.”,"“Oh, non-officially, Sir. Strictly non-officially, so long as you know"
8697,G.S.”,all about it.”
8698,G.S.”,
8699,G.S.”,His awe-stricken fellow-workers could not restrain a smile at Death
8700,G.S.”,having to be told about anything. Even Death bit his lips.
8701,G.S.”,
8702,G.S.”,"“I don’t think you will find the War-side will raise any objection,”"
8703,G.S.”,"said he. “By the way, they don’t wear that uniform over there.”"
8704,G.S.”,
8705,G.S.”,"Almost before Death ceased speaking, it was ripped off and flung on"
8706,G.S.”,"the floor, and that which had been a sober clerk of Normal Civil Death"
8707,G.S.”,"stood up an unmistakable, curly-haired, bat-winged, faun-eared Imp of"
8708,G.S.”,the Pit. But where his wings joined his shoulders there was a patch of
8709,G.S.”,delicate dove-coloured feathering that gave promise to spread all up
8710,G.S.”,"the pinion. St. Peter saw it and smiled, for it was a known sign of"
8711,G.S.”,grace.
8712,G.S.”,
8713,G.S.”,“Thank Goodness!” the ex-clerk gasped as he snatched up the Lattimer
8714,G.S.”,records and sheered sideways through the skylight.
8715,G.S.”,
8716,G.S.”,"“Amen!” said Death and St. Peter together, and walked through the door."
8717,G.S.”,
8718,G.S.”,“Weren’t you hinting something to me a little while ago about _my_ lax
8719,G.S.”,"methods?” St. Peter demanded, innocently."
8720,G.S.”,
8721,G.S.”,"“Well, if one doesn’t help one’s Staff, one’s Staff will never help"
8722,G.S.”,"itself,” Death retorted. “Now, I shall have to pitch in a stiff"
8723,G.S.”,demi-official asking how that young fiend came to be taken on in the
8724,G.S.”,N.C.D. without examination. And I must do it before the N.C.D. complain
8725,G.S.”,that I’ve been interfering with their departmental transfers. _Aren’t_
8726,G.S.”,they human? If you want to go back to The Gate I think our shortest way
8727,G.S.”,will be through here and across the War-Sheds.”
8728,G.S.”,
8729,G.S.”,They came out of a side-door into Heaven’s full light. A phalanx of
8730,G.S.”,Shining Ones swung across a great square singing:
8731,G.S.”,
8732,G.S.”,"“To Him Who made the Heavens abide, yet cease not from their motion,"
8733,G.S.”,To Him Who drives the cleansing tide twice a day round ocean--
8734,G.S.”,Let His Name be magnified in all poor folk’s devotion!”
8735,G.S.”,
8736,G.S.”,"Death halted their leader, and asked a question."
8737,G.S.”,
8738,G.S.”,"“We’re Volunteer Aid Serving Powers,” the Seraph explained, “reporting"
8739,G.S.”,for duty in the Domestic Induced Casualty Department--told off to help
8740,G.S.”,"relatives, where we can.”"
8741,G.S.”,
8742,G.S.”,"The shift trooped on--such an array of Powers, Honours, Glories, Toils,"
8743,G.S.”,"Patiences, Services, Faiths and Loves as no man may conceive even by"
8744,G.S.”,favour of dreams. Death and St. Peter followed them into a D.I.C.D.
8745,G.S.”,"Shed on the English side, where, for the moment, work had slackened."
8746,G.S.”,Suddenly a name flashed on the telephone-indicator. “Mrs. Arthur
8747,G.S.”,"Bedott, 317, Portsmouth Avenue, Brondesbury. Husband badly wounded. One"
8748,G.S.”,child.” Her special weakness was appended.
8749,G.S.”,
8750,G.S.”,A Seraph on the raised dais that overlooked the Volunteer Aids waiting
8751,G.S.”,"at the entrance, nodded and crooked a finger. One of the new shift--a"
8752,G.S.”,temporary Acting Glory--hurled himself from his place and vanished
8753,G.S.”,earthward.
8754,G.S.”,
8755,G.S.”,"“You may take it,” Death whispered to St. Peter, “there will be a"
8756,G.S.”,sustaining epic built up round Private Bedott’s wound for his wife and
8757,G.S.”,Baby Bedott to cling to. And here--” they heard wings that flapped
8758,G.S.”,"wearily--“here, I suspect, comes one of our failures.”"
8759,G.S.”,
8760,G.S.”,"A Seraph entered and dropped, panting, on a form. His plumage was"
8761,G.S.”,"ragged, his sword splintered to the hilt; and his face still worked"
8762,G.S.”,"with the passions of the world he had left, as his soiled vesture"
8763,G.S.”,reeked of alcohol.
8764,G.S.”,
8765,G.S.”,"“Defeat,” he reported hoarsely, when he had given in a woman’s name."
8766,G.S.”,“Utter defeat! Look!” He held up the stump of his sword. “I broke this
8767,G.S.”,on her gin-bottle.”
8768,G.S.”,
8769,G.S.”,"“So? We try again,” said the impassive Chief Seraph. Again he beckoned,"
8770,G.S.”,and there stepped forward that very Imp whom Death had transferred from
8771,G.S.”,the N.C.D.
8772,G.S.”,
8773,G.S.”,“Go _you_!” said the Seraph. “We must deal with a fool according to her
8774,G.S.”,folly. Have you pride enough?”
8775,G.S.”,
8776,G.S.”,There was no need to ask. The messenger’s face glowed and his nostrils
8777,G.S.”,"quivered with it. Scarcely pausing to salute, he poised and dived, and"
8778,G.S.”,the papers on the desks spun beneath the draught of his furious vans.
8779,G.S.”,
8780,G.S.”,St. Peter nodded high approval. “_I_ see!” he said. “He’ll work on her
8781,G.S.”,"pride to steady her. By all means--‘if by all means,’ as my good Paul"
8782,G.S.”,used to say. Only it ought to read ‘by any manner of possible means.’
8783,G.S.”,Excellent!”
8784,G.S.”,
8785,G.S.”,"“It’s difficult, though,” a soft-eyed Patience whispered. “I fail again"
8786,G.S.”,and again. I’m only fit for an old-maid’s tea-party.”
8787,G.S.”,
8788,G.S.”,Once more the record flashed--a multiple-urgent appeal on behalf of a
8789,G.S.”,"few thousand men, worn-out body and soul. The Patience was detailed."
8790,G.S.”,
8791,G.S.”,"“Oh, me!” she sighed, with a comic little shrug of despair, and took"
8792,G.S.”,the void softly as a summer breeze at dawning.
8793,G.S.”,
8794,G.S.”,“But how does this come under the head of Domestic Casualties? Those
8795,G.S.”,"men were in the trenches. I heard the mud squelch,” said St. Peter."
8796,G.S.”,
8797,G.S.”,“Something wrong with the installation--as usual. Waves are always
8798,G.S.”,"jamming here,” the Seraph replied."
8799,G.S.”,
8800,G.S.”,"“So it seems,” said St. Peter as a wireless cut in with the muffled"
8801,G.S.”,"note of some one singing (sorely out of tune), to an accompaniment of"
8802,G.S.”,desultory poppings:
8803,G.S.”,
8804,G.S.”,“Unless you can love as the Angels love With the breadth of Heaven
8805,G.S.”,be----”
8806,G.S.”,
8807,G.S.”,“_Twickt!_” It broke off. The record showed a name. The waiting Seraphs
8808,G.S.”,stiffened to attention with a click of tense quills.
8809,G.S.”,
8810,G.S.”,“As you were!” said the Chief Seraph. “He’s met her.”
8811,G.S.”,
8812,G.S.”,“Who is she?” said St. Peter.
8813,G.S.”,
8814,G.S.”,"“His mother. You never get over your weakness for romance,” Death"
8815,G.S.”,"answered, and a covert smile spread through the Office."
8816,G.S.”,
8817,G.S.”,"“Thank Heaven, I don’t. But I really ought to be going----”"
8818,G.S.”,
8819,G.S.”,"“Wait one minute. Here’s trouble coming through, I think,” Death"
8820,G.S.”,interposed.
8821,G.S.”,
8822,G.S.”,A recorder had sparked furiously in a broken run of S.O.S.’s that
8823,G.S.”,allowed no time for inquiry.
8824,G.S.”,
8825,G.S.”,“Name! Name!” an impatient young Faith panted at last. “It _can’t_ be
8826,G.S.”,blotted out.” No name came up. Only the reiterated appeal.
8827,G.S.”,
8828,G.S.”,"“False alarm!” said a hard-featured Toil, well used to mankind. “Some"
8829,G.S.”,fool has found out that he owns a soul. ’Wants work. _I_’d cure him!...”
8830,G.S.”,
8831,G.S.”,"“Hush!” said a Love in Armour, stamping his mailed foot. The office"
8832,G.S.”,listened.
8833,G.S.”,
8834,G.S.”,“’Bad case?” Death demanded at last.
8835,G.S.”,
8836,G.S.”,"“Rank bad, Sir. They are holding back the name,” said the Chief Seraph."
8837,G.S.”,"The S.O.S. signals grew more desperate, and then ceased with an"
8838,G.S.”,emphatic thump. The Love in Armour winced.
8839,G.S.”,
8840,G.S.”,"“Firing-party,” he whispered to St. Peter. “’Can’t mistake that noise!”"
8841,G.S.”,
8842,G.S.”,“What is it?” St. Peter cried nervously.
8843,G.S.”,
8844,G.S.”,"“Deserter; spy; murderer,” was the Chief Seraph’s weighed answer. “It’s"
8845,G.S.”,out of my department--now. No--hold the line! The name’s up at last.”
8846,G.S.”,
8847,G.S.”,"It showed for an instant, broken and faint as sparks on charred"
8848,G.S.”,"wadding, but in that instant a dozen pens had it written. St. Peter"
8849,G.S.”,with never a word gathered his robes about him and bundled through the
8850,G.S.”,"door, headlong for The Gate."
8851,G.S.”,
8852,G.S.”,"“No hurry,” said Death at his elbow. “With the present rush your man"
8853,G.S.”,won’t come up for ever so long.”
8854,G.S.”,
8855,G.S.”,"“’Never can be sure these days. Anyhow, the Lower Establishment will be"
8856,G.S.”,after him like sharks. He’s the very type they’d want for propaganda.
8857,G.S.”,"Deserter--traitor--murderer. Out of my way, please, babies!”"
8858,G.S.”,
8859,G.S.”,A group of children round a red-headed man who was telling them
8860,G.S.”,"stories, scattered laughing. The man turned to St. Peter."
8861,G.S.”,
8862,G.S.”,"“Deserter, traitor, murderer,” he repeated. “Can _I_ be of service?”"
8863,G.S.”,
8864,G.S.”,“You can!” St. Peter gasped. “Double on ahead to The Gate and tell them
8865,G.S.”,"to hold up all expulsions till I come. Then,” he shouted as the man"
8866,G.S.”,"sped off at a long hound-like trot, “go and picket the outskirts of the"
8867,G.S.”,Convoys. Don’t let any one break away on any account. Quick!”
8868,G.S.”,
8869,G.S.”,But Death was right. They need not have hurried. The crowd at The Gate
8870,G.S.”,"was far beyond the capacities of the Examining Board even though, as"
8871,G.S.”,"St. Peter’s Deputy informed him, it had been enlarged twice in his"
8872,G.S.”,absence.
8873,G.S.”,
8874,G.S.”,"“We’re doing our best,” the Seraph explained, “but delay is inevitable,"
8875,G.S.”,"Sir. The Lower Establishment are taking advantage of it, as usual,"
8876,G.S.”,"at the tail of the Convoys. I’ve doubled all pickets there, and I’m"
8877,G.S.”,"sending more. Here’s the extra list, Sir--Arc J., Bradlaugh C., Bunyan"
8878,G.S.”,"J., Calvin J. Iscariot J. reported to me just now, as under your"
8879,G.S.”,"orders, and took ’em with him. Also Shakespeare W. and----”"
8880,G.S.”,
8881,G.S.”,"“Never mind the rest,” said St. Peter. “I’m going there myself."
8882,G.S.”,"Meantime, carry on with the passes--don’t fiddle over ’em--and give"
8883,G.S.”,"me a blank or two.” He caught up a thick block of Free Passes,"
8884,G.S.”,"nodded to a group in khaki at a passport table, initialled their"
8885,G.S.”,"Commanding Officer’s personal pass as for “Officer and Party,”"
8886,G.S.”,and left the numbers to be filled in by a quite competent-looking
8887,G.S.”,"Quarter-master-Sergeant. Then, Death beside him, he breasted his way"
8888,G.S.”,"out of The Gate against the incoming multitude of all races, tongues,"
8889,G.S.”,and creeds that stretched far across the plain.
8890,G.S.”,
8891,G.S.”,"An old lady, firmly clutching a mottle-nosed, middle-aged Major by the"
8892,G.S.”,"belt, pushed across a procession of keen-faced _poilus_, and blocked"
8893,G.S.”,"his path, her captive held in that terrible mother-grip no Power has"
8894,G.S.”,yet been able to unlock.
8895,G.S.”,
8896,G.S.”,“I found him! I’ve got him! Pass him!” she ordered.
8897,G.S.”,
8898,G.S.”,St. Peter’s jaw fell. Death politely looked elsewhere.
8899,G.S.”,
8900,G.S.”,"“There are a few formalities,” the Saint began."
8901,G.S.”,
8902,G.S.”,“With Jerry in this state? Nonsense! How like a man! My boy never gave
8903,G.S.”,me a moment’s anxiety in----”
8904,G.S.”,
8905,G.S.”,"“Don’t, dear--don’t!” The Major looked almost as uncomfortable as St."
8906,G.S.”,Peter.
8907,G.S.”,
8908,G.S.”,"“Well, nothing compared with what he _would_ give me if he weren’t"
8909,G.S.”,passed.”
8910,G.S.”,
8911,G.S.”,"“Didn’t I hear you singing just now?” Death asked, seeing that his"
8912,G.S.”,companion needed a breathing-space.
8913,G.S.”,
8914,G.S.”,"“Of course you did,” the mother intervened. “He sings beautifully. And"
8915,G.S.”,"that’s _another_ reason! You’re bass, aren’t you now, darling?”"
8916,G.S.”,
8917,G.S.”,St. Peter glanced at the agonised Major and hastily initialled him a
8918,G.S.”,pass. Without a word of thanks the Mother hauled him away.
8919,G.S.”,
8920,G.S.”,"“Now, under what conceivable Ruling do you justify that?” said Death."
8921,G.S.”,
8922,G.S.”,“I.W.--the Importunate Widow. It’s scandalous!” St. Peter groaned. Then
8923,G.S.”,his face darkened as he looked across the great plain beyond The Gate.
8924,G.S.”,"“I don’t like this,” he said. “The Lower Establishment is out in full"
8925,G.S.”,force to-night. I hope our pickets are strong enough----”
8926,G.S.”,
8927,G.S.”,The crowd here had thinned to a disorderly queue flanked on both
8928,G.S.”,"sides by a multitude of busy, discreet emissaries from the Lower"
8929,G.S.”,"Establishment who continually edged in to do business with them, only"
8930,G.S.”,to be edged off again by a line of watchful pickets. Thanks to the
8931,G.S.”,"khaki everywhere, the scene was not unlike that which one might have"
8932,G.S.”,seen on earth any evening of the old days outside the refreshment-room
8933,G.S.”,"by the Arch at Victoria Station, when the Army trains started. St."
8934,G.S.”,Peter’s appearance was greeted by the usual outburst of cock-crowing
8935,G.S.”,from the Lower Establishment.
8936,G.S.”,
8937,G.S.”,"“Dirty work at the cross-roads,” said Death dryly."
8938,G.S.”,
8939,G.S.”,"“I deserve it!” St. Peter grunted, “but think what it must mean for"
8940,G.S.”,Judas.”
8941,G.S.”,
8942,G.S.”,"He shouldered into the thick of the confusion where the pickets coaxed,"
8943,G.S.”,"threatened, implored, and in extreme cases bodily shoved the wearied"
8944,G.S.”,men and women past the voluble and insinuating spirits who strove to
8945,G.S.”,draw them aside.
8946,G.S.”,
8947,G.S.”,"A Shropshire Yeoman had just accepted, together with a forged pass, the"
8948,G.S.”,assurance of a genial runner of the Lower Establishment that Heaven
8949,G.S.”,"lay round the corner, and was being stealthily steered thither, when"
8950,G.S.”,"a large hand jerked him back, another took the runner in the chest,"
8951,G.S.”,"and some one thundered: “Get out, you crimp!” The situation was then"
8952,G.S.”,vividly explained to the soldier in the language of the barrack-room.
8953,G.S.”,
8954,G.S.”,"“Don’t blame _me_, Guv’nor,” the man expostulated. “I ’aven’t seen a"
8955,G.S.”,"woman, let alone angels, for umpteen months. I’m from Joppa. Where ’you"
8956,G.S.”,from?”
8957,G.S.”,
8958,G.S.”,"“Northampton,” was the answer. “Rein back and keep by me.”"
8959,G.S.”,
8960,G.S.”,“What? You ain’t ever Charley B. that my dad used to tell about? I
8961,G.S.”,thought you always said----”
8962,G.S.”,
8963,G.S.”,“I shall say a deal more soon. Your Sergeant’s talking to that woman in
8964,G.S.”,red. Fetch him in--quick!”
8965,G.S.”,
8966,G.S.”,"Meantime, a sunken-eyed Scots officer, utterly lost to the riot"
8967,G.S.”,"around, was being buttonholed by a person of reverend aspect who"
8968,G.S.”,"explained to him, that, by the logic of his own ancestral creed, not"
8969,G.S.”,"only was the Highlander irrevocably damned, but that his damnation had"
8970,G.S.”,been predetermined before Earth was made.
8971,G.S.”,
8972,G.S.”,"“It’s unanswerable--just unanswerable,” said the young man sorrowfully."
8973,G.S.”,"“I’ll be with ye.” He was moving off, when a smallish figure"
8974,G.S.”,"interposed, not without dignity."
8975,G.S.”,
8976,G.S.”,"“Monsieur,” it said, “would it be of any comfort to you to know that"
8977,G.S.”,_I_ am--I was--John Calvin?” At this the reverend one cursed and swore
8978,G.S.”,"like the lost Soul he was, while the Highlander turned to discuss with"
8979,G.S.”,"Calvin, pacing towards The Gate, some alterations in the fabric of a"
8980,G.S.”,work of fiction called the _Institutio_.
8981,G.S.”,
8982,G.S.”,"Others were not so easily held. A certain Woman, with loosened hair,"
8983,G.S.”,"bare arms, flashing eyes and dancing feet, shepherded her knot of"
8984,G.S.”,"waverers, hoarse and exhausted. When the taunt broke out against her"
8985,G.S.”,from the opposing line: “Tell ’em what you were! Tell ’em if you dare!”
8986,G.S.”,"she answered unflinchingly, as did Judas who, worming through the crowd"
8987,G.S.”,"like an Armenian carpet-vendor, peddled his shame aloud that it might"
8988,G.S.”,give strength to others.
8989,G.S.”,
8990,G.S.”,"“Yes,” he would cry, “I am everything they say, but if _I_’m here it"
8991,G.S.”,"must be a moral cert for _you_, gents. This way, please. Many mansions,"
8992,G.S.”,"gentlemen! Go-ood billets! Don’t you notice these low people, Sar."
8993,G.S.”,"_Plees_ keep hope, gentlemen!”"
8994,G.S.”,
8995,G.S.”,When there were cases that cried to him from the ground--poor souls
8996,G.S.”,who could not stick it but had found their way out with a rifle
8997,G.S.”,"and a boot-lace, he would tell them of his own end, till he made"
8998,G.S.”,them contemptuous enough to rise up and curse him. Here St. Luke’s
8999,G.S.”,imperturbable bedside manner backed and strengthened the other’s
9000,G.S.”,almost too oriental flux of words.
9001,G.S.”,
9002,G.S.”,"In this fashion and step by step, all the day’s Convoy were piloted"
9003,G.S.”,"past that danger-point where the Lower Establishment are, for reasons"
9004,G.S.”,"not given us, allowed to ply their trade. The pickets dropped to the"
9005,G.S.”,"rear, relaxed, and compared notes."
9006,G.S.”,
9007,G.S.”,"“What always impresses me most,” said Death to St. Peter, “is the"
9008,G.S.”,sheeplike simplicity of the intellectual mind.” He had been watching
9009,G.S.”,one of the pickets apparently overwhelmed by the arguments of an
9010,G.S.”,advanced atheist who--so hot in his argument that he was deaf to the
9011,G.S.”,"offers of the Lower Establishment to make him a god--had stalked,"
9012,G.S.”,talking hard--while the picket always gave ground before him--straight
9013,G.S.”,past the Broad Road.
9014,G.S.”,
9015,G.S.”,"“He was plaiting of long-tagged epigrams,” the sober-faced picket"
9016,G.S.”,smiled. “Give that sort only an ear and they’ll follow ye gobbling like
9017,G.S.”,turkeys.”
9018,G.S.”,
9019,G.S.”,"“And John held his peace through it all,” a full fresh voice broke in."
9020,G.S.”,"“‘It may be so,’ says John. ‘Doubtless, in your belief, it _is_ so,’"
9021,G.S.”,"says John. ‘Your words move me mightily,’ says John, and gorges his"
9022,G.S.”,"own beliefs like a pike going backwards. And that young fool, so busy"
9023,G.S.”,spinning words--words--words--that he trips past Hell Mouth without
9024,G.S.”,"seeing it!... Who’s yonder, Joan?”"
9025,G.S.”,
9026,G.S.”,“One of your English. ’Always late. Look!” A young girl with
9027,G.S.”,short-cropped hair pointed with her sword across the plain towards a
9028,G.S.”,single faltering figure which made at first as though to overtake the
9029,G.S.”,"Convoy, but then turned left towards the Lower Establishment, who were"
9030,G.S.”,enthusiastically cheering him as a leader of enterprise.
9031,G.S.”,
9032,G.S.”,"“That’s my traitor,” said St. Peter. “He has no business to report to"
9033,G.S.”,the Lower Establishment before reporting to Convoy.”
9034,G.S.”,
9035,G.S.”,The figure’s pace slackened as he neared the applauding line. He looked
9036,G.S.”,"over his shoulder once or twice, and then fairly turned tail and fled"
9037,G.S.”,again towards the still Convoy.
9038,G.S.”,
9039,G.S.”,"“Nobody ever gave me credit for anything I did,” he began, sobbing and"
9040,G.S.”,gesticulating. “They were all against me from the first. I only wanted
9041,G.S.”,"a little encouragement. It was a regular conspiracy, but _I_ showed ’em"
9042,G.S.”,"what I could do! _I_ showed ’em! And--and--” he halted again. “Oh, God!"
9043,G.S.”,What are you going to do with _me_?”
9044,G.S.”,
9045,G.S.”,"No one offered any suggestion. He ranged sideways like a doubtful dog,"
9046,G.S.”,while across the plain the Lower Establishment murmured seductively.
9047,G.S.”,All eyes turned to St. Peter.
9048,G.S.”,
9049,G.S.”,"“At this moment,” the Saint said half to himself, “I can’t recall any"
9050,G.S.”,precise ruling under which----”
9051,G.S.”,
9052,G.S.”,“My own case?” the ever-ready Judas suggested.
9053,G.S.”,
9054,G.S.”,“No-o! That’s making too much of it. And yet----”
9055,G.S.”,
9056,G.S.”,"“Oh, hurry up and get it over,” the man wailed, and told them all"
9057,G.S.”,"that he had done, ending with the cry that none had ever recognised"
9058,G.S.”,"his merits; neither his own narrow-minded people, his inefficient"
9059,G.S.”,"employers, nor the snobbish jumped-up officers of his battalion."
9060,G.S.”,
9061,G.S.”,"“You see,” said St. Peter at the end. “It’s sheer vanity. It isn’t even"
9062,G.S.”,as if we had a woman to fall back upon.”
9063,G.S.”,
9064,G.S.”,"“Yet there was a woman or I’m mistaken,” said the picket with the"
9065,G.S.”,pleasing voice who had praised John.
9066,G.S.”,
9067,G.S.”,“Eh--what? When?” St. Peter turned swiftly on the speaker. “Who was the
9068,G.S.”,woman?”
9069,G.S.”,
9070,G.S.”,"“The wise woman of Tekoah,” came the smooth answer. “I remember,"
9071,G.S.”,because that verse was the private heart of my plays--some of ’em.”
9072,G.S.”,
9073,G.S.”,"But the Saint was not listening. “You have it!” he cried. “Samuel Two,"
9074,G.S.”,Double Fourteen. To think that _I_ should have forgotten! ‘For we
9075,G.S.”,must needs die and are as water spilled on the ground which cannot be
9076,G.S.”,"gathered up again. Neither doth God respect any person, _yet_--’ Here"
9077,G.S.”,you! Listen to this!”
9078,G.S.”,
9079,G.S.”,The man stepped forward and stood to attention. Some one took his cap
9080,G.S.”,as Judas and the picket John closed up beside him.
9081,G.S.”,
9082,G.S.”,“‘_Yet doth He devise means_ (d’you understand that?) _devise means
9083,G.S.”,that His banished be not expelled from Him!_’ This covers your case. I
9084,G.S.”,don’t know what the means will be. That’s for you to find out. They’ll
9085,G.S.”,tell you yonder.” He nodded towards the now silent Lower Establishment
9086,G.S.”,as he scribbled on a pass. “Take this paper over to them and report for
9087,G.S.”,duty there. You’ll have a thin time of it; but they won’t keep you a
9088,G.S.”,day longer than I’ve put down. Escort!”
9089,G.S.”,
9090,G.S.”,“Does--does that mean there’s any hope?” the man stammered.
9091,G.S.”,
9092,G.S.”,"“Yes--I’ll show you the way,” Judas whispered. “I’ve lived there--a"
9093,G.S.”,very long time!”
9094,G.S.”,
9095,G.S.”,"“I’ll bear you company a piece,” said John, on his left flank."
9096,G.S.”,"“There’ll be Despair to deal with. Heart up, Mr. Littlesoul!”"
9097,G.S.”,
9098,G.S.”,"The three wheeled off, and the Convoy watched them grow smaller and"
9099,G.S.”,smaller across the plain.
9100,G.S.”,
9101,G.S.”,St. Peter smiled benignantly and rubbed his hands.
9102,G.S.”,
9103,G.S.”,"“And now we’re rested,” said he, “I think we might make a push for"
9104,G.S.”,"billets this evening, gentlemen, eh?”"
9105,G.S.”,
9106,G.S.”,"The pickets fell in, guardians no longer but friends and companions"
9107,G.S.”,all down the line. There was a little burst of cheering and the whole
9108,G.S.”,Convoy strode away towards the not so distant Gate.
9109,G.S.”,
9110,G.S.”,The Saint and Death stayed behind to rest awhile. It was a heavenly
9111,G.S.”,"evening. They could hear the whistle of the low-flighting Cherubim,"
9112,G.S.”,"clear and sharp, under the diviner note of some released Seraph’s"
9113,G.S.”,"wings, where, his errand accomplished, he plunged three or four stars"
9114,G.S.”,deep into the cool Baths of Hercules; the steady dynamo-like hum of the
9115,G.S.”,"nearer planets on their axes; and, as the hush deepened, the surprised"
9116,G.S.”,little sigh of some new-born sun a universe of universes away. But
9117,G.S.”,their minds were with the Convoy that their eyes followed.
9118,G.S.”,
9119,G.S.”,Said St. Peter proudly at last: “If those people of mine had seen that
9120,G.S.”,"fellow stripped of all hope in front of ’em, I doubt if they could have"
9121,G.S.”,"marched another yard to-night. Watch ’em stepping out now, though!"
9122,G.S.”,Aren’t they human?”
9123,G.S.”,
9124,G.S.”,“To whom do you say it?” Death answered with something of a tired
9125,G.S.”,smile. “I’m more than human. _I_’ve got to die some time or other. But
9126,G.S.”,all other created Beings--afterwards....”
9127,G.S.”,
9128,G.S.”,"“_I_ know,” said St. Peter softly. “And that is why I love you, O"
9129,G.S.”,Azrael!”
9130,G.S.”,
9131,G.S.”,"For now they were alone Death had, of course, returned to his true"
9132,G.S.”,majestic shape--that only One of all created beings who is doomed to
9133,G.S.”,"perish utterly, and knows it."
9134,G.S.”,
9135,G.S.”,"“Well, that’s _that_--for me!” Death concluded as he rose. “And yet--”"
9136,G.S.”,he glanced towards the empty plain where the Lower Establishment had
9137,G.S.”,withdrawn with their prisoner. “‘Yet doth He devise means.’”

9258,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9259,THE EYE OF ALLAH,The Cantor of St. Illod’s being far too enthusiastic a musician to
9260,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"concern himself with its Library, the Sub-Cantor, who idolised every"
9261,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"detail of the work, was tidying up, after two hours’ writing and"
9262,THE EYE OF ALLAH,dictation in the Scriptorium. The copying-monks handed him in their
9263,THE EYE OF ALLAH,sheets--it was a plain Four Gospels ordered by an Abbot at Evesham--and
9264,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"filed out to vespers. John Otho, better known as John of Burgos, took"
9265,THE EYE OF ALLAH,no heed. He was burnishing a tiny boss of gold in his miniature of
9266,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"the Annunciation for his Gospel of St. Luke, which it was hoped that"
9267,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Cardinal Falcodi, the Papal Legate, might later be pleased to accept."
9268,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9269,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Break off, John,” said the Sub-Cantor in an undertone."
9270,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9271,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Eh? Gone, have they? I never heard. Hold a minute, Clement.”"
9272,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9273,THE EYE OF ALLAH,The Sub-Cantor waited patiently. He had known John more than a dozen
9274,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"years, coming and going at St. Illod’s, to which monastery John, when"
9275,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"abroad, always said he belonged. The claim was gladly allowed for, more"
9276,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"even than other Fitz Otho’s, he seemed to carry all the Arts under his"
9277,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"hand, and most of their practical receipts under his hood."
9278,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9279,THE EYE OF ALLAH,The Sub-Cantor looked over his shoulder at the pinned-down sheet where
9280,THE EYE OF ALLAH,the first words of the Magnificat were built up in gold washed with
9281,THE EYE OF ALLAH,red-lac for a background to the Virgin’s hardly yet fired halo. She was
9282,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"shown, hands joined in wonder, at a lattice of infinitely intricate"
9283,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"arabesque, round the edges of which sprays of orange-bloom seemed"
9284,THE EYE OF ALLAH,to load the blue hot air that carried back over the minute parched
9285,THE EYE OF ALLAH,landscape in the middle distance.
9286,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9287,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“You’ve made her all Jewess,” said the Sub-Cantor, studying the"
9288,THE EYE OF ALLAH,olive-flushed cheek and the eyes charged with foreknowledge.
9289,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9290,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“What else was Our Lady?” John slipped out the pins. “Listen, Clement."
9291,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"If I do not come back, this goes into my Great Luke, whoever finishes"
9292,THE EYE OF ALLAH,it.” He slid the drawing between its guard-papers.
9293,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9294,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Then you’re for Burgos again--as I heard?”
9295,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9296,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“In two days. The new Cathedral yonder--but they’re slower than the

9298,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9299,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“_Thy_ soul?” The Sub-Cantor seemed doubtful.
9300,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9301,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Even mine, by your permission. And down south--on the edge of the"
9302,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Conquered Countries--Granada way--there’s some Moorish diaper-work
9303,THE EYE OF ALLAH,that’s wholesome. It allays vain thought and draws it toward the
9304,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"picture--as you felt, just now, in my Annunciation.”"
9305,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9306,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“She--it was very beautiful. No wonder you go. But you’ll not forget
9307,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"your absolution, John?”"
9308,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9309,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Surely.” This was a precaution John no more omitted on the eve of his
9310,THE EYE OF ALLAH,travels than he did the recutting of the tonsure which he had provided
9311,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"himself with in his youth, somewhere near Ghent. The mark gave him"
9312,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"privilege of clergy at a pinch, and a certain consideration on the road"
9313,THE EYE OF ALLAH,always.
9314,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9315,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“You’ll not forget, either, what we need in the Scriptorium. There’s"
9316,THE EYE OF ALLAH,no more true ultramarine in this world now. They mix it with that
9317,THE EYE OF ALLAH,German blue. And as for vermilion----”
9318,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9319,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“I’ll do my best always.”
9320,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9321,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“And Brother Thomas (this was the Infirmarian in charge of the
9322,THE EYE OF ALLAH,monastery hospital) he needs----”
9323,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9324,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“He’ll do his own asking. I’ll go over his side now, and get me"
9325,THE EYE OF ALLAH,re-tonsured.”
9326,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9327,THE EYE OF ALLAH,John went down the stairs to the lane that divides the hospital and
9328,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"cook-house from the back-cloisters. While he was being barbered,"
9329,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Brother Thomas (St. Illod’s meek but deadly persistent Infirmarian)
9330,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"gave him a list of drugs that he was to bring back from Spain by hook,"
9331,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"crook, or lawful purchase. Here they were surprised by the lame, dark"
9332,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Abbot Stephen, in his fur-lined night-boots. Not that Stephen de Sautré"
9333,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"was any spy; but as a young man he had shared an unlucky Crusade, which"
9334,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"had ended, after a battle at Mansura, in two years’ captivity among the"
9335,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Saracens at Cairo where men learn to walk softly. A fair huntsman and
9336,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"hawker, a reasonable disciplinarian but a man of science above all,"
9337,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"and a Doctor of Medicine under one Ranulphus, Canon of St. Paul’s, his"
9338,THE EYE OF ALLAH,heart was more in the monastery’s hospital work than its religious. He
9339,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"checked their list interestedly, adding items of his own. After the"
9340,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Infirmarian had withdrawn he gave John generous absolution, to cover"
9341,THE EYE OF ALLAH,lapses by the way; for he did not hold with chance-bought Indulgences.
9342,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9343,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“And what seek you _this_ journey?” he demanded, sitting on the bench"
9344,THE EYE OF ALLAH,beside the mortar and scales in the little warm cell for stored drugs.
9345,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9346,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Devils, mostly,” said John, grinning."
9347,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9348,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“In Spain? Are not Abana and Pharphar----?”
9349,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9350,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"John, to whom men were but matter for drawings, and well-born to boot"
9351,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"(since he was a de Sanford on his mother’s side), looked the Abbot"
9352,THE EYE OF ALLAH,full in the face and--“Did _you_ find it so?” said he.
9353,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9354,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“No. They were in Cairo too. But what’s your special need of ’em?”
9355,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9356,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“For my Great Luke. He’s the master-hand of all Four when it comes to
9357,THE EYE OF ALLAH,devils.”
9358,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9359,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“No wonder. He was a physician. You’re not.”
9360,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9361,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Heaven forbid! But I’m weary of our Church-pattern devils. They’re
9362,THE EYE OF ALLAH,only apes and goats and poultry conjoined. ’Good enough for plain
9363,THE EYE OF ALLAH,red-and-black Hells and Judgment Days--but not for me.”
9364,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9365,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“What makes you so choice in them?”
9366,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9367,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Because it stands to reason and Art that there are all musters of
9368,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"devils in Hell’s dealings. Those Seven, for example, that were haled"
9369,THE EYE OF ALLAH,out of the Magdalene. They’d be she-devils--no kin at all to the beaked
9370,THE EYE OF ALLAH,and horned and bearded devils-general.”
9371,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9372,THE EYE OF ALLAH,The Abbot laughed.
9373,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9374,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“And see again! The devil that came out of the dumb man. What use is
9375,THE EYE OF ALLAH,snout or bill to _him_? He’d be faceless as a leper. Above all--God
9376,THE EYE OF ALLAH,send I live to do it!--the devils that entered the Gadarene swine.
9377,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"They’d be--they’d be--I know not yet what they’d be, but they’d be"
9378,THE EYE OF ALLAH,surpassing devils. I’d have ’em diverse as the Saints themselves. But
9379,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"now, they’re all one pattern, for wall, window, or picture-work.”"
9380,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9381,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Go on, John. You’re deeper in this mystery than I.”"
9382,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9383,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Heaven forbid! But I say there’s respect due to devils, damned tho’"
9384,THE EYE OF ALLAH,they be.”
9385,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9386,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Dangerous doctrine.”
9387,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9388,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“My meaning is that if the shape of anything be worth man’s thought to
9389,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"picture to man, it’s worth his best thought.”"
9390,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9391,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“That’s safer. But I’m glad I’ve given you Absolution.”
9392,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9393,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“There’s less risk for a craftsman who deals with the outside shapes of
9394,THE EYE OF ALLAH,things--for Mother Church’s glory.”
9395,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9396,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Maybe so, but John”--the Abbot’s hand almost touched John’s"
9397,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"sleeve--“tell me, now, is--is she Moorish or--or Hebrew?”"
9398,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9399,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“She’s mine,” John returned."
9400,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9401,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Is that enough?”
9402,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9403,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“I have found it so.”
9404,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9405,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Well--ah well! It’s out of my jurisdiction but--how do they look at it
9406,THE EYE OF ALLAH,down yonder?”
9407,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9408,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Oh, they drive nothing to a head in Spain--neither Church nor King,"
9409,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"bless them! There’s too many Moors and Jews to kill them all, and if"
9410,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"they chased ’em away there’d be no trade nor farming. Trust me, in the"
9411,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Conquered Countries, from Seville to Granada, we live lovingly enough"
9412,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"together--Spaniard, Moor, and Jew. Ye see, _we_ ask no questions.”"
9413,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9414,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Yes--yes,” Stephen sighed. “And always there’s the hope, she may be"
9415,THE EYE OF ALLAH,converted.”
9416,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9417,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Oh yes, there’s always hope.”"
9418,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9419,THE EYE OF ALLAH,The Abbot went on into the hospital. It was an easy age before Rome
9420,THE EYE OF ALLAH,tightened the screw as to clerical connections. If the lady were
9421,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"not too forward, or the son too much his father’s beneficiary in"
9422,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"ecclesiastical preferments and levies, a good deal was overlooked. But,"
9423,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"as the Abbot had reason to recall, unions between Christian and Infidel"
9424,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"led to sorrow. None the less, when John with mule, mails, and man,"
9425,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"clattered off down the lane for Southampton and the sea, Stephen envied"
9426,THE EYE OF ALLAH,him.
9427,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9428,THE EYE OF ALLAH,*       *       *       *       *
9429,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9430,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"He was back, twenty months later, in good hard case, and loaded down"
9431,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"with fairings. A lump of richest lazuli, a bar of orange-hearted"
9432,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"vermilion, and a small packet of dried beetles which make most glorious"
9433,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"scarlet, for the Sub-Cantor. Besides that, a few cubes of milky marble,"
9434,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"with yet a pink flush in them, which could be slaked and ground down"
9435,THE EYE OF ALLAH,to incomparable background-stuff. There were quite half the drugs
9436,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"that the Abbot and Thomas had demanded, and there was a long deep-red"
9437,THE EYE OF ALLAH,cornelian necklace for the Abbot’s Lady--Anne of Norton. She received
9438,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"it graciously, and asked where John had come by it."
9439,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9440,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Near Granada,” he said."
9441,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9442,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“You left all well there?” Anne asked. (Maybe the Abbot had told her
9443,THE EYE OF ALLAH,something of John’s confession.)
9444,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9445,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“I left all in the hands of God.”
9446,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9447,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Ah me! How long since?”
9448,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9449,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Four months less eleven days.”
9450,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9451,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Were you--with her?”
9452,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9453,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“In my arms. Childbed.”
9454,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9455,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“And?”
9456,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9457,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“The boy too. There is nothing now.”
9458,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9459,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Anne of Norton caught her breath.
9460,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9461,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“I think you’ll be glad of that,” she said after a while."
9462,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9463,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Give me time, and maybe I’ll compass it. But not now.”"
9464,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9465,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“You have your handwork and your art and--John--remember there’s no
9466,THE EYE OF ALLAH,jealousy in the grave.”
9467,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9468,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Ye-es! I have my Art, and Heaven knows I’m jealous of none.”"
9469,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9470,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Thank God for that at least,” said Anne of Norton, the always ailing"
9471,THE EYE OF ALLAH,woman who followed the Abbot with her sunk eyes. “And be sure I shall
9472,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"treasure this,” she touched the beads, “as long as I shall live.”"
9473,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9474,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“I brought--trusted--it to you for that,” he replied, and took leave."
9475,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"When she told the Abbot how she had come by it, he said nothing, but as"
9476,THE EYE OF ALLAH,he and Thomas were storing the drugs that John handed over in the cell
9477,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"which backs on to the hospital kitchen-chimney, he observed, of a cake"
9478,THE EYE OF ALLAH,of dried poppy-juice: “This has power to cut off all pain from a man’s
9479,THE EYE OF ALLAH,body.”
9480,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9481,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“I have seen it,” said John."
9482,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9483,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“But for pain of the soul there is, outside God’s Grace, but one drug;"
9484,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"and that is a man’s craft, learning, or other helpful motion of his own"
9485,THE EYE OF ALLAH,mind.”
9486,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9487,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“That is coming to me, too,” was the answer."
9488,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9489,THE EYE OF ALLAH,John spent the next fair May day out in the woods with the monastery
9490,THE EYE OF ALLAH,swineherd and all the porkers; and returned loaded with flowers and
9491,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"sprays of spring, to his own carefully kept place in the north bay of"
9492,THE EYE OF ALLAH,the Scriptorium. There with his travelling sketch-books under his left
9493,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"elbow, he sunk himself past all recollections in his Great Luke."
9494,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9495,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Brother Martin, Senior Copyist (who spoke about once a fortnight)"
9496,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"ventured to ask, later, how the work was going."
9497,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9498,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“All here!” John tapped his forehead with his pencil. “It has been
9499,THE EYE OF ALLAH,only waiting these months to--ah God!--be born. Are ye free of your
9500,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"plain-copying, Martin?”"
9501,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9502,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Brother Martin nodded. It was his pride that John of Burgos turned to
9503,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"him, in spite of his seventy years, for really good page-work."
9504,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9505,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Then see!” John laid out a new vellum--thin but flawless. “There’s no
9506,THE EYE OF ALLAH,better than this sheet from here to Paris. Yes! Smell it if you choose.
9507,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Wherefore--give me the compasses and I’ll set it out for you--if ye
9508,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"make one letter lighter or darker than its next, I’ll stick ye like a"
9509,THE EYE OF ALLAH,pig.”
9510,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9511,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Never, John!” the old man beamed happily."
9512,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9513,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“But I will! Now, follow! Here and here, as I prick, and in script of"
9514,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"just this height to the hair’s-breadth, ye’ll scribe the thirty-first"
9515,THE EYE OF ALLAH,and thirty-second verses of Eighth Luke.”
9516,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9517,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Yes, the Gadarene Swine! ‘_And they besought him that he would not"
9518,THE EYE OF ALLAH,command them to go out into the abyss. And there was a herd of many
9519,THE EYE OF ALLAH,swine_’”----Brother Martin naturally knew all the Gospels by heart.
9520,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9521,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Just so! Down to ‘_and he suffered them_.’ Take your time to it. My
9522,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Magdalene has to come off my heart first.”
9523,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9524,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Brother Martin achieved the work so perfectly that John stole some soft
9525,THE EYE OF ALLAH,sweetmeats from the Abbot’s kitchen for his reward. The old man ate
9526,THE EYE OF ALLAH,them; then repented; then confessed and insisted on penance. At which
9527,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"the Abbot, knowing there was but one way to reach the real sinner, set"
9528,THE EYE OF ALLAH,him a book called _De Virtutibus Herbarum_ to fair-copy. St. Illod’s
9529,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"had borrowed it from the gloomy Cistercians, who do not hold with"
9530,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"pretty things, and the crabbed text kept Martin busy just when John"
9531,THE EYE OF ALLAH,wanted him for some rather specially spaced letterings.
9532,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9533,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“See now,” said the Sub-Cantor reprovingly. “You should not do such"
9534,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"things, John. Here’s Brother Martin on penance for your sake----”"
9535,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9536,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“No--for my Great Luke. But I’ve paid the Abbot’s cook. I’ve drawn him
9537,THE EYE OF ALLAH,till his own scullions cannot keep straight-faced. _He_’ll not tell
9538,THE EYE OF ALLAH,again.”
9539,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9540,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Unkindly done! And you’re out of favour with the Abbot too. He’s made
9541,THE EYE OF ALLAH,no sign to you since you came back--never asked you to high table.”
9542,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9543,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“I’ve been busy. Having eyes in his head, Stephen knew it. Clement,"
9544,THE EYE OF ALLAH,there’s no Librarian from Durham to Torre fit to clean up after you.”
9545,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9546,THE EYE OF ALLAH,The Sub-Cantor stood on guard; he knew where John’s compliments
9547,THE EYE OF ALLAH,generally ended.
9548,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9549,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“But outside the Scriptorium----”
9550,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9551,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Where I never go.” The Sub-Cantor had been excused even digging in the
9552,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"garden, lest it should mar his wonderful book-binding hands."
9553,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9554,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“In all things outside the Scriptorium you are the master-fool of
9555,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Christendie. Take it from me, Clement. I’ve met many.”"
9556,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9557,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“I take everything from you,” Clement smiled benignly. “You use me"
9558,THE EYE OF ALLAH,worse than a singing-boy.”
9559,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9560,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"They could hear one of that suffering breed in the cloister below,"
9561,THE EYE OF ALLAH,squalling as the Cantor pulled his hair.
9562,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9563,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“God love you! So I do! But have you ever thought how I lie and steal
9564,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"daily on my travels--yes, and for aught you know, murder--to fetch you"
9565,THE EYE OF ALLAH,colours and earths?”
9566,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9567,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“True,” said just and conscience-stricken Clement. “I have often"
9568,THE EYE OF ALLAH,thought that were I in the world--which God forbid!--I might be a
9569,THE EYE OF ALLAH,strong thief in some matters.”
9570,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9571,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Even Brother Martin, bent above his loathed _De Virtutibus_, laughed."
9572,THE EYE OF ALLAH,

9574,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9575,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"But about mid-summer, Thomas the Infirmarian conveyed to John the"
9576,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Abbot’s invitation to supper in his house that night, with the request"
9577,THE EYE OF ALLAH,that he would bring with him anything that he had done for his Great
9578,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Luke.
9579,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9580,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“What’s toward?” said John, who had been wholly shut up in his work."
9581,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9582,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Only one of his ‘wisdom’ dinners. You’ve sat at a few since you were a
9583,THE EYE OF ALLAH,man.”
9584,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9585,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“True: and mostly good. How would Stephen have us----?”
9586,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9587,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Gown and hood over all. There will be a doctor from Salerno--one
9588,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Roger, an Italian. Wise and famous with the knife on the body. He’s"
9589,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"been in the Infirmary some ten days, helping me--even me!”"
9590,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9591,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“’Never heard the name. But our Stephen’s _physicus_ before _sacerdos_,"
9592,THE EYE OF ALLAH,always.”
9593,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9594,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“And his Lady has a sickness of some time. Roger came hither in chief
9595,THE EYE OF ALLAH,because of her.”
9596,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9597,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Did he? Now I think of it, I have not seen the Lady Anne for a while.”"
9598,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9599,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Ye’ve seen nothing for a long while. She has been housed near a
9600,THE EYE OF ALLAH,month--they have to carry her abroad now.”
9601,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9602,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“So bad as that, then?”"
9603,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9604,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Roger of Salerno will not yet say what he thinks. But----”
9605,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9606,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“God pity Stephen!... Who else at table, beside thee?”"
9607,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9608,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“An Oxford friar. Roger is his name also. A learned and famous
9609,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"philosopher. And he holds his liquor too, valiantly.”"
9610,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9611,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Three doctors--counting Stephen. I’ve always found that means two
9612,THE EYE OF ALLAH,atheists.”
9613,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9614,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Thomas looked uneasily down his nose. “That’s a wicked proverb,” he"
9615,THE EYE OF ALLAH,stammered. “You should not use it.”
9616,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9617,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Hoh! Never come you the monk over me, Thomas! You’ve been Infirmarian"
9618,THE EYE OF ALLAH,at St. Illod’s eleven years--and a lay-brother still. Why have you
9619,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"never taken orders, all this while?”"
9620,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9621,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“I--I am not worthy.”
9622,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9623,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Ten times worthier than that new fat swine--Henry
9624,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Who’s-his-name--that takes the Infirmary Masses. He bullocks in with
9625,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"the Viaticum, under your nose, when a sick man’s only faint from being"
9626,THE EYE OF ALLAH,bled. So the man dies--of pure fear. Ye know it! I’ve watched your face
9627,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"at such times. Take Orders, Didymus. You’ll have a little more medicine"
9628,THE EYE OF ALLAH,and a little less Mass with your sick then; and they’ll live longer.”
9629,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9630,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“I am unworthy--unworthy,” Thomas repeated pitifully."
9631,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9632,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Not you--but--to your own master you stand or fall. And now that my
9633,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"work releases me for a while, I’ll drink with any philosopher out of"
9634,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"any school. And Thomas,” he coaxed, “a hot bath for me in the Infirmary"

9639,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"When the Abbot’s perfectly cooked and served meal had ended, and the"
9640,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"deep-fringed naperies were removed, and the Prior had sent in the keys"
9641,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"with word that all was fast in the Monastery, and the keys had been"
9642,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"duly returned with the word: “Make it so till Prime,” the Abbot and"
9643,THE EYE OF ALLAH,his guests went out to cool themselves in an upper cloister that took
9644,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"them, by way of the leads, to the South Choir side of the Triforium."
9645,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"The summer sun was still strong, for it was barely six o’clock, but the"
9646,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Abbey Church, of course, lay in her wonted darkness. Lights were being"
9647,THE EYE OF ALLAH,lit for choir-practice thirty feet below.
9648,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9649,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Our Cantor gives them no rest,” the Abbot whispered. “Stand by this"
9650,THE EYE OF ALLAH,pillar and we’ll hear what he’s driving them at now.”
9651,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9652,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Remember all!” the Cantor’s hard voice came up. “This is the soul
9653,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"of Bernard himself, attacking our evil world. Take it quicker than"
9654,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"yesterday, and throw all your words clean-bitten from you. In the loft"
9655,THE EYE OF ALLAH,there! Begin!”
9656,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9657,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"The organ broke out for an instant, alone and raging. Then the voices"
9658,THE EYE OF ALLAH,crashed together into that first fierce line of the “_De Contemptu
9659,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Mundi_.”[5]
9660,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9661,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“_Hora novissima_--_tempora pessima_”--a dead pause till, the assenting"
9662,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"_sunt_ broke, like a sob, out of the darkness, and one boy’s voice,"
9663,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"clearer than silver trumpets, returned the long-drawn _vigilemus_."
9664,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9665,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“_Ecce minaciter, imminet Arbiter_” (organ and voices were leashed"
9666,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"together in terror and warning, breaking away liquidly to the"
9667,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“_ille supremus_”). Then the tone-colours shifted for the prelude
9668,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"to--“_Imminet, imminet, ut mala terminet_----”"
9669,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9670,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Stop! Again!” cried the Cantor; and gave his reasons a little more
9671,THE EYE OF ALLAH,roundly than was natural at choir-practice.
9672,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9673,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Ah! Pity o’ man’s vanity! He’s guessed we are here. Come away!” said
9674,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"the Abbot. Anne of Norton, in her carried chair, had been listening"
9675,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"too, further along the dark Triforium, with Roger of Salerno. John"
9676,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"heard her sob. On the way back, he asked Thomas how her health stood."
9677,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Before Thomas could reply the sharp-featured Italian doctor pushed
9678,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"between them. “Following on our talk together, I judged it best to tell"
9679,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"her,” said he to Thomas."
9680,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9681,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“What?” John asked simply enough.
9682,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9683,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“What she knew already.” Roger of Salerno launched into a Greek
9684,THE EYE OF ALLAH,quotation to the effect that every woman knows all about everything.
9685,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9686,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“I have no Greek,” said John stiffly. Roger of Salerno had been giving"
9687,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"them a good deal of it, at dinner."
9688,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9689,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Then I’ll come to you in Latin. Ovid hath it neatly. ‘_Utque malum
9690,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"late solet immedicabile cancer_----’ but doubtless you know the rest,"
9691,THE EYE OF ALLAH,worthy Sir.”
9692,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9693,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Alas! My school-Latin’s but what I’ve gathered by the way from fools
9694,THE EYE OF ALLAH,professing to heal sick women. ‘_Hocus-pocus_----’ but doubtless you
9695,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"know the rest, worthy Sir.”"
9696,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9697,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Roger of Salerno was quite quiet till they regained the dining-room,"
9698,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"where the fire had been comforted and the dates, raisins, ginger, figs,"
9699,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"and cinnamon-scented sweetmeats set out, with the choicer wines, on the"
9700,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"after-table. The Abbot seated himself, drew off his ring, dropped it,"
9701,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"that all might hear the tinkle, into an empty silver cup, stretched his"
9702,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"feet towards the hearth, and looked at the great gilt and carved rose"
9703,THE EYE OF ALLAH,in the barrel-roof. The silence that keeps from Compline to Matins had
9704,THE EYE OF ALLAH,closed on their world. The bull-necked Friar watched a ray of sunlight
9705,THE EYE OF ALLAH,split itself into colours on the rim of a crystal salt-cellar; Roger
9706,THE EYE OF ALLAH,of Salerno had re-opened some discussion with Brother Thomas on a type
9707,THE EYE OF ALLAH,of spotted fever that was baffling them both in England and abroad;
9708,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"John took note of the keen profile, and--it might serve as a note for"
9709,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"the Great Luke--his hand moved to his bosom. The Abbot saw, and nodded"
9710,THE EYE OF ALLAH,permission. John whipped out silver-point and sketch-book.
9711,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9712,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Nay--modesty is good enough--but deliver your own opinion,” the"
9713,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Italian was urging the Infirmarian. Out of courtesy to the foreigner
9714,THE EYE OF ALLAH,nearly all the talk was in table-Latin; more formal and more copious
9715,THE EYE OF ALLAH,than monk’s patter. Thomas began with his meek stammer.
9716,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9717,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“I confess myself at a loss for the cause of the fever unless--as Varro
9718,THE EYE OF ALLAH,saith in his _De Re Rustica_--certain small animals which the eye
9719,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"cannot follow enter the body by the nose and mouth, and set up grave"
9720,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"diseases. On the other hand, this is not in Scripture.”"
9721,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9722,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Roger of Salerno hunched head and shoulders like an angry cat. “Always
9723,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"_that_!” he said, and John snatched down the twist of the thin lips."
9724,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9725,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Never at rest, John,” the Abbot smiled at the artist. “You should"
9726,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"break off every two hours for prayers, as we do. St. Benedict was no"
9727,THE EYE OF ALLAH,fool. Two hours is all that a man can carry the edge of his eye or
9728,THE EYE OF ALLAH,hand.”
9729,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9730,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“For copyists--yes. Brother Martin is not sure after one hour. But when
9731,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"a man’s work takes him, he must go on till it lets him go.”"
9732,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9733,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Yes, that is the Demon of Socrates,” the Friar from Oxford rumbled"
9734,THE EYE OF ALLAH,above his cup.
9735,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9736,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“The doctrine leans toward presumption,” said the Abbot. “Remember,"
9737,THE EYE OF ALLAH,‘Shall mortal man be more just than his Maker?’”
9738,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9739,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“There is no danger of justice”; the Friar spoke bitterly. “But at
9740,THE EYE OF ALLAH,least Man might be suffered to go forward in his Art or his thought.
9741,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Yet if Mother Church sees or hears him move anyward, what says she?"
9742,THE EYE OF ALLAH,‘No!’ Always ‘No.’”
9743,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9744,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“But if the little animals of Varro be invisible”--this was Roger of
9745,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Salerno to Thomas--“how are we any nearer to a cure?”
9746,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9747,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“By experiment”--the Friar wheeled round on them suddenly. “By reason
9748,THE EYE OF ALLAH,and experiment. The one is useless without the other. But Mother
9749,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Church----”
9750,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9751,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Ay!” Roger de Salerno dashed at the fresh bait like a pike. “Listen,"
9752,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Sirs. Her bishops--our Princes--strew our roads in Italy with carcasses
9753,THE EYE OF ALLAH,that they make for their pleasure or wrath. Beautiful corpses! Yet if
9754,THE EYE OF ALLAH,I--if we doctors--so much as raise the skin of one of them to look at
9755,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"God’s fabric beneath, what says Mother Church? ‘Sacrilege! Stick to"
9756,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"your pigs and dogs, or you burn!’”"
9757,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9758,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“And not Mother Church only!” the Friar chimed in. “_Every_ way we are
9759,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"barred--barred by the words of some man, dead a thousand years, which"
9760,THE EYE OF ALLAH,are held final. Who is any son of Adam that his one say-so should close
9761,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"a door towards truth? I would not except even Peter Peregrinus, my own"
9762,THE EYE OF ALLAH,great teacher.”
9763,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9764,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Nor I Paul of Aegina,” Roger of Salerno cried. “Listen Sirs! Here is a"
9765,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"case to the very point. Apuleius affirmeth, if a man eat fasting of the"
9766,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"juice of the cut-leaved buttercup--_sceleratus_ we call it, which means"
9767,THE EYE OF ALLAH,‘rascally’”--this with a condescending nod towards John--“his soul will
9768,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"leave his body laughing. Now this is the lie more dangerous than truth,"
9769,THE EYE OF ALLAH,since truth of a sort is in it.”
9770,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9771,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“He’s away!” whispered the Abbot despairingly.
9772,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9773,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“For the juice of that herb, I know by experiment, burns, blisters, and"
9774,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"wries the mouth. I know also the _rictus_, or pseudo-laughter on the"
9775,THE EYE OF ALLAH,face of such as have perished by the strong poisons of herbs allied
9776,THE EYE OF ALLAH,to this ranunculus. Certainly that spasm resembles laughter. It seems
9777,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"then, in my judgment, that Apuleius, having seen the body of one thus"
9778,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"poisoned, went off at score and wrote that the man died laughing.”"
9779,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9780,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Neither staying to observe, nor to confirm observation by experiment,”"
9781,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"added the Friar, frowning."
9782,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9783,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Stephen the Abbot cocked an eyebrow toward John.
9784,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9785,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“How think _you_?” said he.
9786,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9787,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“I’m no doctor,” John returned, “but I’d say Apuleius in all these"
9788,THE EYE OF ALLAH,years might have been betrayed by his copyists. They take shortcuts to
9789,THE EYE OF ALLAH,save ’emselves trouble. Put case that Apuleius wrote the soul _seems
9790,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"to_ leave the body laughing, after this poison. There’s not three"
9791,THE EYE OF ALLAH,copyists in five (_my_ judgment) would not leave out the ‘seems to.’
9792,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"For who’d question Apuleius? If it seemed so to him, so it must be."
9793,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Otherwise any child knows cut-leaved buttercup.”
9794,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9795,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Have you knowledge of herbs?” Roger of Salerno asked curtly.
9796,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9797,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Only, that when I was a boy in convent, I’ve made tetters round my"
9798,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"mouth and on my neck with buttercup-juice, to save going to prayer o’"
9799,THE EYE OF ALLAH,cold nights.”
9800,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9801,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Ah!” said Roger. “I profess no knowledge of tricks.” He turned aside,"
9802,THE EYE OF ALLAH,stiffly.
9803,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9804,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“No matter! Now for your own tricks, John,” the tactful Abbot broke in."
9805,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“You shall show the doctors your Magdalene and your Gadarene Swine and
9806,THE EYE OF ALLAH,the devils.”
9807,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9808,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Devils? Devils? _I_ have produced devils by means of drugs; and have
9809,THE EYE OF ALLAH,abolished them by the same means. Whether devils be external to mankind
9810,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"or immanent, I have not yet pronounced.” Roger of Salerno was still"
9811,THE EYE OF ALLAH,angry.
9812,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9813,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Ye dare not,” snapped the Friar from Oxford. “Mother Church makes Her"
9814,THE EYE OF ALLAH,own devils.”
9815,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9816,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Not wholly! Our John has come back from Spain with brand-new ones.”
9817,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Abbot Stephen took the vellum handed to him, and laid it tenderly on"
9818,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"the table. They gathered to look. The Magdalene was drawn in palest,"
9819,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"almost transparent, grisaille, against a raging, swaying background of"
9820,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"woman-faced devils, each broke to and by her special sin, and each, one"
9821,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"could see, frenziedly straining against the Power that compelled her."
9822,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9823,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“I’ve never seen the like of this grey shadow-work,” said the Abbot."
9824,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“How came you by it?”
9825,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9826,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“_Non nobis!_ It came to me,” said John, not knowing he was a"
9827,THE EYE OF ALLAH,generation or so ahead of his time in the use of that medium.
9828,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9829,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Why is she so pale?” the Friar demanded.
9830,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9831,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Evil has all come out of her--she’d take any colour now.”
9832,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9833,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Ay, like light through glass. _I_ see.”"
9834,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9835,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Roger of Salerno was looking in silence--his nose nearer and
9836,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"nearer the page. “It is so,” he pronounced finally. “Thus it is in"
9837,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"epilepsy--mouth, eyes, and forehead--even to the droop of her wrist"
9838,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"there. Every sign of it! She will need restoratives, that woman, and,"
9839,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"afterwards, sleep natural. No poppy-juice, or she will vomit on her"
9840,THE EYE OF ALLAH,waking. And thereafter--but I am not in my Schools.” He drew himself
9841,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"up. “Sir,” said he, “you should be of Our calling. For, by the Snakes"
9842,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"of Aesculapius, you _see_!”"
9843,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9844,THE EYE OF ALLAH,The two struck hands as equals.
9845,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9846,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“And how think you of the Seven Devils?” the Abbot went on.
9847,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9848,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"These melted into convoluted flower- or flame-like bodies, ranging"
9849,THE EYE OF ALLAH,in colour from phosphorescent green to the black purple of outworn
9850,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"iniquity, whose hearts could be traced beating through their substance."
9851,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"But, for sign of hope and the sane workings of life, to be regained,"
9852,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"the deep border was of conventionalised spring flowers and birds, all"
9853,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"crowned by a kingfisher in haste, atilt through a clump of yellow iris."
9854,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9855,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Roger of Salerno identified the herbs and spoke largely of their
9856,THE EYE OF ALLAH,virtues.
9857,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9858,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“And now, the Gadarene Swine,” said Stephen. John laid the picture on"
9859,THE EYE OF ALLAH,the table.
9860,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9861,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Here were devils dishoused, in dread of being abolished to the Void,"
9862,THE EYE OF ALLAH,huddling and hurtling together to force lodgment by every opening
9863,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"into the brute bodies offered. Some of the swine fought the invasion,"
9864,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"foaming and jerking; some were surrendering to it, sleepily, as"
9865,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"to a luxurious back-scratching; others, wholly possessed, whirled"
9866,THE EYE OF ALLAH,off in bucking droves for the lake beneath. In one corner the freed
9867,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"man stretched out his limbs all restored to his control, and Our"
9868,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Lord, seated, looked at him as questioning what he would make of his"
9869,THE EYE OF ALLAH,deliverance.
9870,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9871,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Devils indeed!” was the Friar’s comment. “But wholly a new sort.”
9872,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9873,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Some devils were mere lumps, with lobes and protuberances--a hint of a"
9874,THE EYE OF ALLAH,fiend’s face peering through jelly-like walls. And there was a family
9875,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"of impatient, globular devillings who had burst open the belly of their"
9876,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"smirking parent, and were revolving desperately towards their prey."
9877,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Others patterned themselves into rods, chains and ladders, single or"
9878,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"conjoined, round the throat and jaws of a shrieking sow, from whose"
9879,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"ear emerged the lashing, glassy tail of a devil that had made good his"
9880,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"refuge. And there were granulated and conglomerate devils, mixed up"
9881,THE EYE OF ALLAH,with the foam and slaver where the attack was fiercest. Thence the eye
9882,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"carried on to the insanely active backs of the downward-racing swine,"
9883,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"the swineherd’s aghast face, and his dog’s terror."
9884,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9885,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Said Roger of Salerno, “I pronounce that these were begotten of drugs."
9886,THE EYE OF ALLAH,They stand outside the rational mind.”
9887,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9888,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Not these,” said Thomas the Infirmarian, who as a servant of"
9889,THE EYE OF ALLAH,the Monastery should have asked his Abbot’s leave to speak. “Not
9890,THE EYE OF ALLAH,_these_--look!--in the bordure.”
9891,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9892,THE EYE OF ALLAH,The border to the picture was a diaper of irregular but balanced
9893,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"compartments or cellules, where sat, swam, or weltered, devils in"
9894,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"blank, so to say--things as yet uninspired by Evil--indifferent, but"
9895,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"lawlessly outside imagination. Their shapes resembled, again, ladders,"
9896,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"chains, scourges, diamonds, aborted buds, or gravid phosphorescent"
9897,THE EYE OF ALLAH,globes--some well-nigh star-like.
9898,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9899,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Roger of Salerno compared them to the obsessions of a Churchman’s mind.
9900,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9901,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Malignant?” the Friar from Oxford questioned.
9902,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9903,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“‘Count everything unknown for horrible,’” Roger quoted with scorn."
9904,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9905,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Not I. But they are marvellous--marvellous. I think----”
9906,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9907,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"The Friar drew back. Thomas edged in to see better, and half opened his"
9908,THE EYE OF ALLAH,mouth.
9909,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9910,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Speak,” said Stephen, who had been watching him. “We are all in a sort"
9911,THE EYE OF ALLAH,doctors here.”
9912,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9913,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“I would say then”--Thomas rushed at it as one putting out his life’s
9914,THE EYE OF ALLAH,belief at the stake--“that these lower shapes in the bordure may not be
9915,THE EYE OF ALLAH,so much hellish and malignant as models and patterns upon which John
9916,THE EYE OF ALLAH,has tricked out and embellished his proper devils among the swine above
9917,THE EYE OF ALLAH,there!”
9918,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9919,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“And that would signify?” said Roger of Salerno sharply.
9920,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9921,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“In my poor judgment, that he may have seen such shapes--without help"
9922,THE EYE OF ALLAH,of drugs.”
9923,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9924,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Now who--_who_”--said John of Burgos, after a round and unregarded"
9925,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"oath--“has made thee so wise of a sudden, my Doubter?”"
9926,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9927,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“I wise? God forbid! Only John, remember--one winter six years ago--the"
9928,THE EYE OF ALLAH,snowflakes melting on your sleeve at the cookhouse-door. You showed me
9929,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"them through a little crystal, that made small things larger.”"
9930,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9931,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Yes. The Moors call such a glass the Eye of Allah,” John confirmed."
9932,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9933,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“You showed me them melting--six-sided. You called them, then, your"
9934,THE EYE OF ALLAH,patterns.”
9935,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9936,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“True. Snow-flakes melt six-sided. I have used them for diaper-work
9937,THE EYE OF ALLAH,often.”
9938,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9939,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Melting snow-flakes as seen through a glass? By art optical?” the
9940,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Friar asked.
9941,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9942,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Art optical? _I_ have never heard!” Roger of Salerno cried.
9943,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9944,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“John,” said the Abbot of St. Illod’s commandingly, “was it--is it so?”"
9945,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9946,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“In some sort,” John replied, “Thomas has the right of it. Those shapes"
9947,THE EYE OF ALLAH,in the bordure were my workshop-patterns for the devils above. In _my_
9948,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"craft, Salerno, we dare not drug. It kills hand and eye. My shapes are"
9949,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"to be seen honestly, in nature.”"
9950,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9951,THE EYE OF ALLAH,The Abbot drew a bowl of rose-water towards him. “When I was prisoner
9952,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"with--with the Saracens after Mansura,” he began, turning up the fold"
9953,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"of his long sleeve, “there were certain magicians--physicians--who"
9954,THE EYE OF ALLAH,could show--” he dipped his third finger delicately in the water--“all
9955,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"the firmament of Hell, as it were, in--” he shook off one drop from his"
9956,THE EYE OF ALLAH,polished nail on to the polished table--“even such a supernaculum as
9957,THE EYE OF ALLAH,this.”
9958,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9959,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“But it must be foul water--not clean,” said John."
9960,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9961,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Show us then--all--all,” said Stephen. “I would make sure--once more.”"
9962,THE EYE OF ALLAH,The Abbot’s voice was official.
9963,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9964,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"John drew from his bosom a stamped leather box, some six or eight"
9965,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"inches long, wherein, bedded on faded velvet, lay what looked like"
9966,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"silver-bound compasses of old box-wood, with a screw at the head which"
9967,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"opened or closed the legs to minute fractions. The legs terminated, not"
9968,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"in points, but spoon-shapedly, one spatula pierced with a metal-lined"
9969,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"hole less than a quarter of an inch across, the other with a half-inch"
9970,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"hole. Into this latter John, after carefully wiping with a silk rag,"
9971,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"slipped a metal cylinder that carried glass or crystal, it seemed, at"
9972,THE EYE OF ALLAH,each end.
9973,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9974,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Ah! Art optic!” said the Friar. “But what is that beneath it?”
9975,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9976,THE EYE OF ALLAH,It was a small swivelling sheet of polished silver no bigger than a
9977,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"florin, which caught the light and concentrated it on the lesser hole."
9978,THE EYE OF ALLAH,John adjusted it without the Friar’s proffered help.
9979,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9980,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“And now to find a drop of water,” said he, picking up a small brush."
9981,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9982,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Come to my upper cloister. The sun is on the leads still,” said the"
9983,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Abbot, rising."
9984,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9985,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"They followed him there. Half way along, a drip from a gutter had made"
9986,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"a greenish puddle in a worn stone. Very carefully, John dropped a drop"
9987,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"of it into the smaller hole of the compass-leg, and, steadying the"
9988,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"apparatus on a coping, worked the screw in the compass-joint, screwed"
9989,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"the cylinder, and swung the swivel of the mirror till he was satisfied."
9990,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9991,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Good!” He peered through the thing. “My Shapes are all here. Now look,"
9992,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Father! If they do not meet your eye at first, turn this nicked edge"
9993,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"here, left or right-handed.”"
9994,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9995,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“I have not forgotten,” said the Abbot, taking his place. “Yes! They"
9996,THE EYE OF ALLAH,are here--as they were in my time--my time past. There is no end to
9997,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"them, I was told.... There _is_ no end!”"
9998,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
9999,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“The light will go. Oh, let me look! Suffer me to see, also!” the Friar"
10000,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"pleaded, almost shouldering Stephen from the eye-piece. The Abbot gave"
10001,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"way. His eyes were on time past. But the Friar, instead of looking,"
10002,THE EYE OF ALLAH,turned the apparatus in his capable hands.
10003,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10004,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Nay, nay,” John interrupted, for the man was already fiddling at the"
10005,THE EYE OF ALLAH,screws. “Let the Doctor see.”
10006,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10007,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Roger of Salerno looked, minute after minute. John saw his blue-veined"
10008,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"cheek-bones turn white. He stepped back at last, as though stricken."
10009,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10010,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“It is a new world--a new world and--Oh, God Unjust!--I am old!”"
10011,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10012,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“And now Thomas,” Stephen ordered."
10013,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10014,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"John manipulated the tube for the Infirmarian, whose hands shook, and"
10015,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"he too looked long. “It is Life,” he said presently in a breaking"
10016,THE EYE OF ALLAH,voice. “No Hell! Life created and rejoicing--the work of the Creator.
10017,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"They live, even as I have dreamed. Then it was no sin for me to dream."
10018,THE EYE OF ALLAH,No sin--O God--no sin!”
10019,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10020,THE EYE OF ALLAH,He flung himself on his knees and began hysterically the _Benedicite
10021,THE EYE OF ALLAH,omnia Opera_.
10022,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10023,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“And now I will see how it is actuated,” said the Friar from Oxford,"
10024,THE EYE OF ALLAH,thrusting forward again.
10025,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10026,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Bring it within. The place is all eyes and ears,” said Stephen."
10027,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10028,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"They walked quietly back along the leads, three English counties laid"
10029,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"out in evening sunshine around them; church upon church, monastery upon"
10030,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"monastery, cell after cell, and the bulk of a vast cathedral moored on"
10031,THE EYE OF ALLAH,the edge of the banked shoals of sunset.
10032,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10033,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"When they were at the after-table once more they sat down, all except"
10034,THE EYE OF ALLAH,the Friar who went to the window and huddled bat-like over the thing.
10035,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“I see! I see!” he was repeating to himself.
10036,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10037,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“He’ll not hurt it,” said John. But the Abbot, staring in front of him,"
10038,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"like Roger of Salerno, did not hear. The Infirmarian’s head was on the"
10039,THE EYE OF ALLAH,table between his shaking arms.
10040,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10041,THE EYE OF ALLAH,John reached for a cup of wine.
10042,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10043,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“It was shown to me,” the Abbot was speaking to himself, “in Cairo,"
10044,THE EYE OF ALLAH,that man stands ever between two Infinities--of greatness and
10045,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"littleness. Therefore, there is no end--either to life--or----”"
10046,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10047,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“And _I_ stand on the edge of the grave,” snarled Roger of Salerno."
10048,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Who pities _me_?”
10049,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10050,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Hush!” said Thomas the Infirmarian. “The little creatures shall be
10051,THE EYE OF ALLAH,sanctified--sanctified to the service of His sick.”
10052,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10053,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“What need?” John of Burgos wiped his lips. “It shows no more than the
10054,THE EYE OF ALLAH,shapes of things. It gives good pictures. I had it at Granada. It was
10055,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"brought from the East, they told me.”"
10056,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10057,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Roger of Salerno laughed with an old man’s malice. “What of Mother
10058,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Church? Most Holy Mother Church? If it comes to Her ears that we have
10059,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"spied into Her Hell without Her leave, where do we stand?”"
10060,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10061,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“At the stake,” said the Abbot of St. Illod’s, and, raising his voice a"
10062,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"trifle. “You hear that? Roger Bacon, heard you that?”"
10063,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10064,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"The Friar turned from the window, clutching the compasses tighter."
10065,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10066,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“No, no!” he appealed. “Not with Falcodi--not with our English-hearted"
10067,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Foulkes made Pope. He’s wise--he’s learned. He reads what I have put
10068,THE EYE OF ALLAH,forth. Foulkes would never suffer it.”
10069,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10070,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“‘Holy Pope is one thing, Holy Church another,’” Roger quoted."
10071,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10072,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“But I--_I_ can bear witness it is no Art Magic,” the Friar went on."
10073,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Nothing is it, except Art optical--wisdom after trial and experiment,"
10074,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"mark you. I can prove it, and--my name weighs with men who dare think.”"
10075,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10076,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Find them!” croaked Roger of Salerno. “Five or six in all the world.
10077,THE EYE OF ALLAH,That makes less than fifty pounds by weight of ashes at the stake. I
10078,THE EYE OF ALLAH,have watched such men--reduced.”
10079,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10080,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“I will not give this up!” The Friar’s voice cracked in passion and
10081,THE EYE OF ALLAH,despair. “It would be to sin against the Light.”
10082,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10083,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“No, no! Let us--let us sanctify the little animals of Varro,” said"
10084,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Thomas.
10085,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10086,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Stephen leaned forward, fished his ring out of the cup, and slipped it"
10087,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"on his finger. “My sons,” said he, “we have seen what we have seen.”"
10088,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10089,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“That it is no magic but simple Art,” the Friar persisted."
10090,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10091,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“’Avails nothing. In the eyes of Mother Church we have seen more than
10092,THE EYE OF ALLAH,is permitted to man.”
10093,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10094,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“But it was Life--created and rejoicing,” said Thomas."
10095,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10096,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“To look into Hell as we shall be judged--as we shall be proved--to
10097,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"have looked, is for priests only.”"
10098,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10099,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Or green-sick virgins on the road to sainthood who, for cause any"
10100,THE EYE OF ALLAH,mid-wife could give you----”
10101,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10102,THE EYE OF ALLAH,The Abbot’s half-lifted hand checked Roger of Salerno’s outpouring.
10103,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10104,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Nor may even priests see more in Hell than Church knows to be there.
10105,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"John, there is respect due to Church as well as to Devils.”"
10106,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10107,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“My trade’s the outside of things,” said John quietly. “I have my"
10108,THE EYE OF ALLAH,patterns.”
10109,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10110,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“But you may need to look again for more,” the Friar said."
10111,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10112,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“In my craft, a thing done is done with. We go on to new shapes after"
10113,THE EYE OF ALLAH,that.”
10114,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10115,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“And if we trespass beyond bounds, even in thought, we lie open to the"
10116,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"judgment of the Church,” the Abbot continued."
10117,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10118,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“But thou knowest--_knowest_!” Roger of Salerno had returned to the
10119,THE EYE OF ALLAH,attack. “Here’s all the world in darkness concerning the causes of
10120,THE EYE OF ALLAH,things--from the fever across the lane to thy Lady’s--thine own
10121,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Lady’s--eating malady. Think!”
10122,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10123,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“I have thought upon it, Salerno! I have thought indeed.”"
10124,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10125,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Thomas the Infirmarian lifted his head again; and this time he did not
10126,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"stammer at all. “As in the water, so in the blood must they rage and"
10127,THE EYE OF ALLAH,war with each other! I have dreamed these ten years--I thought it was a
10128,THE EYE OF ALLAH,sin--but my dreams and Varro’s are true! Think on it again! Here’s the
10129,THE EYE OF ALLAH,Light under our very hand!”
10130,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10131,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“Quench it! You’d no more stand to roasting than--any other. I’ll give
10132,THE EYE OF ALLAH,you the case as Church--as I myself--would frame it. Our John here
10133,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"returns from the Moors, and shows us a hell of devils contending in the"
10134,THE EYE OF ALLAH,compass of one drop of water. Magic past clearance! You can hear the
10135,THE EYE OF ALLAH,faggots crackle.”
10136,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10137,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“But thou knowest! Thou hast seen it all before! For man’s poor sake!
10138,THE EYE OF ALLAH,For old friendship’s sake--Stephen!” The Friar was trying to stuff the
10139,THE EYE OF ALLAH,compasses into his bosom as he appealed.
10140,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10141,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“What Stephen de Sautré knows, you his friends know also. I would have"
10142,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"you, now, obey the Abbot of St. Illod’s. Give to me!” He held out his"
10143,THE EYE OF ALLAH,ringed hand.
10144,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10145,THE EYE OF ALLAH,“May I--may John here--not even make a drawing of one--one screw?” said
10146,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"the broken Friar, in spite of himself."
10147,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10148,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“Nowise!” Stephen took it over. “Your dagger, John. Sheathed will"
10149,THE EYE OF ALLAH,serve.”
10150,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10151,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"He unscrewed the metal cylinder, laid it on the table, and with the"
10152,THE EYE OF ALLAH,dagger’s hilt smashed some crystal to sparkling dust which he swept
10153,THE EYE OF ALLAH,into a scooped hand and cast behind the hearth.
10154,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10155,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"“It would seem,” said he, “the choice lies between two sins. To deny"
10156,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"the world a Light which is under our hand, or to enlighten the"
10157,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"world before her time. What you have seen, I saw long since among"
10158,THE EYE OF ALLAH,the physicians at Cairo. And I know what doctrine they drew from it.
10159,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Hast _thou_ dreamed, Thomas? I also--with fuller knowledge. But this"
10160,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"birth, my sons, is untimely. It will be but the mother of more death,"
10161,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"more torture, more division, and greater darkness in this dark age."
10162,THE EYE OF ALLAH,"Therefore I, who know both my world and the Church, take this Choice"
10163,THE EYE OF ALLAH,on my conscience. Go! It is finished.”
10164,THE EYE OF ALLAH,
10165,THE EYE OF ALLAH,He thrust the wooden part of the compasses deep among the beech logs
10166,THE EYE OF ALLAH,till all was burned.

10222,THE GARDENER,
10223,THE GARDENER,
10224,THE GARDENER,Every one in the village knew that Helen Turrell did her duty by all
10225,THE GARDENER,"her world, and by none more honourably than by her only brother’s"
10226,THE GARDENER,"unfortunate child. The village knew, too, that George Turrell had"
10227,THE GARDENER,"tried his family severely since early youth, and were not surprised to"
10228,THE GARDENER,"be told that, after many fresh starts given and thrown away, he, an"
10229,THE GARDENER,"Inspector of Indian Police, had entangled himself with the daughter of"
10230,THE GARDENER,"a retired non-commissioned officer, and had died of a fall from a horse"
10231,THE GARDENER,"a few weeks before his child was born. Mercifully, George’s father and"
10232,THE GARDENER,"mother were both dead, and though Helen, thirty-five and independent,"
10233,THE GARDENER,"might well have washed her hands of the whole disgraceful affair, she"
10234,THE GARDENER,"most nobly took charge, though she was, at the time, under threat of"
10235,THE GARDENER,lung trouble which had driven her to the South of France. She arranged
10236,THE GARDENER,"for the passage of the child and a nurse from Bombay, met them at"
10237,THE GARDENER,"Marseilles, nursed the baby through an attack of infantile dysentery"
10238,THE GARDENER,"due to the carelessness of the nurse, whom she had had to dismiss, and"
10239,THE GARDENER,"at last, thin and worn but triumphant, brought the boy late in the"
10240,THE GARDENER,"autumn, wholly restored, to her Hampshire home."
10241,THE GARDENER,
10242,THE GARDENER,"All these details were public property, for Helen was as open as the"
10243,THE GARDENER,"day, and held that scandals are only increased by hushing them up. She"
10244,THE GARDENER,"admitted that George had always been rather a black sheep, but things"
10245,THE GARDENER,might have been much worse if the mother had insisted on her right to
10246,THE GARDENER,"keep the boy. Luckily, it seemed that people of that class would do"
10247,THE GARDENER,"almost anything for money, and, as George had always turned to her"
10248,THE GARDENER,"in his scrapes, she felt herself justified--her friends agreed with"
10249,THE GARDENER,"her--in cutting the whole non-commissioned officer connection, and"
10250,THE GARDENER,"giving the child every advantage. A christening, by the Rector, under"
10251,THE GARDENER,"the name of Michael, was the first step. So far as she knew herself,"
10252,THE GARDENER,"she was not, she said, a child-lover, but, for all his faults, she had"
10253,THE GARDENER,"been very fond of George, and she pointed out that little Michael had"
10254,THE GARDENER,his father’s mouth to a line; which made something to build upon.
10255,THE GARDENER,
10256,THE GARDENER,"As a matter of fact, it was the Turrell forehead, broad, low, and"
10257,THE GARDENER,"well-shaped, with the widely-spaced eyes beneath it, that Michael had"
10258,THE GARDENER,most faithfully reproduced. His mouth was somewhat better cut than the
10259,THE GARDENER,"family type. But Helen, who would concede nothing good to his mother’s"
10260,THE GARDENER,"side, vowed he was a Turrell all over, and, there being no one to"
10261,THE GARDENER,"contradict, the likeness was established."
10262,THE GARDENER,
10263,THE GARDENER,"In a few years Michael took his place, as accepted as Helen had always"
10264,THE GARDENER,"been--fearless, philosophical, and fairly good-looking. At six, he"
10265,THE GARDENER,"wished to know why he could not call her “Mummy,” as other boys called"
10266,THE GARDENER,"their mothers. She explained that she was only his auntie, and that"
10267,THE GARDENER,"aunties were not quite the same as mummies, but that, if it gave him"
10268,THE GARDENER,"pleasure, he might call her “Mummy” at bedtime, for a pet-name between"
10269,THE GARDENER,themselves.
10270,THE GARDENER,
10271,THE GARDENER,"Michael kept his secret most loyally, but Helen, as usual, explained"
10272,THE GARDENER,"the fact to her friends; which when Michael heard, he raged."
10273,THE GARDENER,
10274,THE GARDENER,“Why did you tell? _Why_ did you tell?” came at the end of the storm.
10275,THE GARDENER,
10276,THE GARDENER,"“Because it’s always best to tell the truth,” Helen answered, her arm"
10277,THE GARDENER,round him as he shook in his cot.
10278,THE GARDENER,
10279,THE GARDENER,"“All right, but when the troof’s ugly I don’t think it’s nice.”"
10280,THE GARDENER,
10281,THE GARDENER,"“Don’t you, dear?”"
10282,THE GARDENER,
10283,THE GARDENER,"“No, I don’t, and”--she felt the small body stiffen--“now you’ve told,"
10284,THE GARDENER,I won’t call you ‘Mummy’ any more--not even at bedtimes.”
10285,THE GARDENER,
10286,THE GARDENER,"“But isn’t that rather unkind?” said Helen, softly."
10287,THE GARDENER,
10288,THE GARDENER,“I don’t care! I don’t care! You’ve hurted me in my insides and I’ll
10289,THE GARDENER,hurt you back. I’ll hurt you as long as I live!”
10290,THE GARDENER,
10291,THE GARDENER,"“Don’t, oh, don’t talk like that, dear! You don’t know what----”"
10292,THE GARDENER,
10293,THE GARDENER,“I will! And when I’m dead I’ll hurt you worse!”
10294,THE GARDENER,
10295,THE GARDENER,"“Thank goodness, I shall be dead long before you, darling.”"
10296,THE GARDENER,
10297,THE GARDENER,"“Huh! Emma says, ‘’Never know your luck.’” (Michael had been talking to"
10298,THE GARDENER,"Helen’s elderly, flat-faced maid.) “Lots of little boys die quite soon."
10299,THE GARDENER,So’ll I. _Then_ you’ll see!”
10300,THE GARDENER,
10301,THE GARDENER,"Helen caught her breath and moved towards the door, but the wail of"
10302,THE GARDENER,"“Mummy! Mummy!” drew her back again, and the two wept together."
10303,THE GARDENER,
10304,THE GARDENER,*       *       *       *       *
10305,THE GARDENER,
10306,THE GARDENER,"At ten years old, after two terms at a prep. school, something or"
10307,THE GARDENER,somebody gave him the idea that his civil status was not quite regular.
10308,THE GARDENER,"He attacked Helen on the subject, breaking down her stammered defences"
10309,THE GARDENER,with the family directness.
10310,THE GARDENER,
10311,THE GARDENER,"“’Don’t believe a word of it,” he said, cheerily, at the end. “People"
10312,THE GARDENER,wouldn’t have talked like they did if my people had been married. But
10313,THE GARDENER,"don’t you bother, Auntie. I’ve found out all about my sort in English"
10314,THE GARDENER,Hist’ry and the Shakespeare bits. There was William the Conqueror
10315,THE GARDENER,"to begin with, and--oh, heaps more, and they all got on first-rate."
10316,THE GARDENER,"’Twon’t make any difference to you, my being _that_--will it?”"
10317,THE GARDENER,
10318,THE GARDENER,“As if anything could----” she began.
10319,THE GARDENER,
10320,THE GARDENER,“All right. We won’t talk about it any more if it makes you cry.” He
10321,THE GARDENER,"never mentioned the thing again of his own will, but when, two years"
10322,THE GARDENER,"later, he skilfully managed to have measles in the holidays, as his"
10323,THE GARDENER,temperature went up to the appointed one hundred and four he muttered
10324,THE GARDENER,"of nothing else, till Helen’s voice, piercing at last his delirium,"
10325,THE GARDENER,reached him with assurance that nothing on earth or beyond could make
10326,THE GARDENER,any difference between them.
10327,THE GARDENER,
10328,THE GARDENER,"The terms at his public school and the wonderful Christmas, Easter,"
10329,THE GARDENER,"and Summer holidays followed each other, variegated and glorious as"
10330,THE GARDENER,jewels on a string; and as jewels Helen treasured them. In due time
10331,THE GARDENER,"Michael developed his own interests, which ran their courses and gave"
10332,THE GARDENER,way to others; but his interest in Helen was constant and increasing
10333,THE GARDENER,throughout. She repaid it with all that she had of affection or could
10334,THE GARDENER,"command of counsel and money; and since Michael was no fool, the War"
10335,THE GARDENER,took him just before what was like to have been a most promising
10336,THE GARDENER,career.
10337,THE GARDENER,
10338,THE GARDENER,"He was to have gone up to Oxford, with a scholarship, in October. At"
10339,THE GARDENER,the end of August he was on the edge of joining the first holocaust of
10340,THE GARDENER,public-school boys who threw themselves into the Line; but the captain
10341,THE GARDENER,"of his O.T.C., where he had been sergeant for nearly a year, headed him"
10342,THE GARDENER,off and steered him directly to a commission in a battalion so new that
10343,THE GARDENER,"half of it still wore the old Army red, and the other half was breeding"
10344,THE GARDENER,meningitis through living over-crowdedly in damp tents. Helen had been
10345,THE GARDENER,shocked at the idea of direct enlistment.
10346,THE GARDENER,
10347,THE GARDENER,"“But it’s in the family,” Michael laughed."
10348,THE GARDENER,
10349,THE GARDENER,“You don’t mean to tell me that you believed that old story all this
10350,THE GARDENER,"time?” said Helen. (Emma, her maid, had been dead now several years.)"
10351,THE GARDENER,“I gave you my word of honour--and I give it again--that--that it’s all
10352,THE GARDENER,right. It is indeed.”
10353,THE GARDENER,
10354,THE GARDENER,"“Oh, _that_ doesn’t worry me. It never did,” he replied valiantly."
10355,THE GARDENER,"“What I meant was, I should have got into the show earlier if I’d"
10356,THE GARDENER,enlisted--like my grandfather.”
10357,THE GARDENER,
10358,THE GARDENER,"“Don’t talk like that! Are you afraid of it’s ending so soon, then?”"
10359,THE GARDENER,
10360,THE GARDENER,“No such luck. You know what K. says.”
10361,THE GARDENER,
10362,THE GARDENER,“Yes. But my banker told me last Monday it couldn’t _possibly_ last
10363,THE GARDENER,beyond Christmas--for financial reasons.”
10364,THE GARDENER,
10365,THE GARDENER,"“’Hope he’s right, but our Colonel--and he’s a Regular--says it’s going"
10366,THE GARDENER,to be a long job.”
10367,THE GARDENER,
10368,THE GARDENER,"Michael’s battalion was fortunate in that, by some chance which meant"
10369,THE GARDENER,"several “leaves,” it was used for coast-defence among shallow trenches"
10370,THE GARDENER,on the Norfolk coast; thence sent north to watch the mouth of a Scotch
10371,THE GARDENER,"estuary, and, lastly, held for weeks on a baseless rumour of distant"
10372,THE GARDENER,"service. But, the very day that Michael was to have met Helen for four"
10373,THE GARDENER,"whole hours at a railway-junction up the line, it was hurled out, to"
10374,THE GARDENER,"help make good the wastage of Loos, and he had only just time to send"
10375,THE GARDENER,her a wire of farewell.
10376,THE GARDENER,
10377,THE GARDENER,In France luck again helped the battalion. It was put down near the
10378,THE GARDENER,"Salient, where it led a meritorious and unexacting life, while the"
10379,THE GARDENER,Somme was being manufactured; and enjoyed the peace of the Armentières
10380,THE GARDENER,and Laventie sectors when that battle began. Finding that it had sound
10381,THE GARDENER,"views on protecting its own flanks and could dig, a prudent Commander"
10382,THE GARDENER,"stole it out of its own Division, under pretence of helping to lay"
10383,THE GARDENER,"telegraphs, and used it round Ypres at large."
10384,THE GARDENER,
10385,THE GARDENER,"A month later, and just after Michael had written Helen that there was"
10386,THE GARDENER,"nothing special doing and therefore no need to worry, a shell-splinter"
10387,THE GARDENER,dropping out of a wet dawn killed him at once. The next shell uprooted
10388,THE GARDENER,and laid down over the body what had been the foundation of a barn
10389,THE GARDENER,"wall, so neatly that none but an expert would have guessed that"
10390,THE GARDENER,anything unpleasant had happened.
10391,THE GARDENER,
10392,THE GARDENER,*       *       *       *       *
10393,THE GARDENER,
10394,THE GARDENER,"By this time the village was old in experience of war, and, English"
10395,THE GARDENER,"fashion, had evolved a ritual to meet it. When the postmistress handed"
10396,THE GARDENER,her seven-year-old daughter the official telegram to take to Miss
10397,THE GARDENER,"Turrell, she observed to the Rector’s gardener: “It’s Miss Helen’s turn"
10398,THE GARDENER,"now.” He replied, thinking of his own son: “Well, he’s lasted longer"
10399,THE GARDENER,"than some.” The child herself came to the front-door weeping aloud,"
10400,THE GARDENER,"because Master Michael had often given her sweets. Helen, presently,"
10401,THE GARDENER,found herself pulling down the house-blinds one after one with great
10402,THE GARDENER,"care, and saying earnestly to each: “Missing _always_ means dead.”"
10403,THE GARDENER,Then she took her place in the dreary procession that was impelled to
10404,THE GARDENER,"go through an inevitable series of unprofitable emotions. The Rector,"
10405,THE GARDENER,"of course, preached hope and prophesied word, very soon, from a prison"
10406,THE GARDENER,"camp. Several friends, too, told her perfectly truthful tales, but"
10407,THE GARDENER,"always about other women, to whom, after months and months of silence,"
10408,THE GARDENER,their missing had been miraculously restored. Other people urged her
10409,THE GARDENER,to communicate with infallible Secretaries of organisations who could
10410,THE GARDENER,"communicate with benevolent neutrals, who could extract accurate"
10411,THE GARDENER,information from the most secretive of Hun prison commandants. Helen
10412,THE GARDENER,did and wrote and signed everything that was suggested or put before
10413,THE GARDENER,her.
10414,THE GARDENER,
10415,THE GARDENER,"Once, on one of Michael’s leaves, he had taken her over a munition"
10416,THE GARDENER,"factory, where she saw the progress of a shell from blank-iron to"
10417,THE GARDENER,the all but finished article. It struck her at the time that the
10418,THE GARDENER,wretched thing was never left alone for a single second; and “I’m being
10419,THE GARDENER,"manufactured into a bereaved next-of-kin,” she told herself, as she"
10420,THE GARDENER,prepared her documents.
10421,THE GARDENER,
10422,THE GARDENER,"In due course, when all the organisations had deeply or sincerely"
10423,THE GARDENER,"regretted their inability to trace, etc., something gave way within her"
10424,THE GARDENER,and all sensation--save of thankfulness for the release--came to an end
10425,THE GARDENER,in blessed passivity. Michael had died and her world had stood still
10426,THE GARDENER,and she had been one with the full shock of that arrest. Now she was
10427,THE GARDENER,"standing still and the world was going forward, but it did not concern"
10428,THE GARDENER,her--in no way or relation did it touch her. She knew this by the ease
10429,THE GARDENER,with which she could slip Michael’s name into talk and incline her head
10430,THE GARDENER,"to the proper angle, at the proper murmur of sympathy."
10431,THE GARDENER,
10432,THE GARDENER,"In the blessed realisation of that relief, the Armistice with all its"
10433,THE GARDENER,bells broke over her and passed unheeded. At the end of another year
10434,THE GARDENER,she had overcome her physical loathing of the living and returned
10435,THE GARDENER,"young, so that she could take them by the hand and almost sincerely"
10436,THE GARDENER,"wish them well. She had no interest in any aftermath, national or"
10437,THE GARDENER,"personal, of the War, but, moving at an immense distance, she sat on"
10438,THE GARDENER,various relief committees and held strong views--she heard herself
10439,THE GARDENER,delivering them--about the site of the proposed village War Memorial.
10440,THE GARDENER,
10441,THE GARDENER,"Then there came to her, as next of kin, an official intimation,"
10442,THE GARDENER,"backed by a page of a letter to her in indelible pencil, a silver"
10443,THE GARDENER,"identity-disc, and a watch, to the effect that the body of Lieutenant"
10444,THE GARDENER,"Michael Turrell had been found, identified, and re-interred in"
10445,THE GARDENER,Hagenzeele Third Military Cemetery--the letter of the row and the
10446,THE GARDENER,grave’s number in that row duly given.
10447,THE GARDENER,
10448,THE GARDENER,So Helen found herself moved on to another process of the
10449,THE GARDENER,"manufacture--to a world full of exultant or broken relatives, now"
10450,THE GARDENER,strong in the certainty that there was an altar upon earth where they
10451,THE GARDENER,"might lay their love. These soon told her, and by means of time-tables"
10452,THE GARDENER,"made clear, how easy it was and how little it interfered with life’s"
10453,THE GARDENER,affairs to go and see one’s grave.
10454,THE GARDENER,
10455,THE GARDENER,"“_So_ different,” as the Rector’s wife said, “if he’d been killed in"
10456,THE GARDENER,"Mesopotamia, or even Gallipoli.”"
10457,THE GARDENER,
10458,THE GARDENER,The agony of being waked up to some sort of second life drove Helen
10459,THE GARDENER,"across the Channel, where, in a new world of abbreviated titles,"
10460,THE GARDENER,she learnt that Hagenzeele Third could be comfortably reached by an
10461,THE GARDENER,"afternoon train which fitted in with the morning boat, and that there"
10462,THE GARDENER,was a comfortable little hotel not three kilometres from Hagenzeele
10463,THE GARDENER,"itself, where one could spend quite a comfortable night and see one’s"
10464,THE GARDENER,grave next morning. All this she had from a Central Authority who lived
10465,THE GARDENER,in a board and tar-paper shed on the skirts of a razed city full of
10466,THE GARDENER,whirling lime-dust and blown papers.
10467,THE GARDENER,
10468,THE GARDENER,"“By the way,” said he, “you know your grave, of course?”"
10469,THE GARDENER,
10470,THE GARDENER,"“Yes, thank you,” said Helen, and showed its row and number typed on"
10471,THE GARDENER,"Michael’s own little typewriter. The officer would have checked it, out"
10472,THE GARDENER,of one of his many books; but a large Lancashire woman thrust between
10473,THE GARDENER,"them and bade him tell her where she might find her son, who had been"
10474,THE GARDENER,"corporal in the A.S.C. His proper name, she sobbed, was Anderson, but,"
10475,THE GARDENER,"coming of respectable folk, he had of course enlisted under the name of"
10476,THE GARDENER,"Smith; and had been killed at Dickiebush, in early ’Fifteen. She had"
10477,THE GARDENER,not his number nor did she know which of his two Christian names he
10478,THE GARDENER,might have used with his alias; but her Cook’s tourist ticket expired
10479,THE GARDENER,"at the end of Easter week, and if by then she could not find her child"
10480,THE GARDENER,she should go mad. Whereupon she fell forward on Helen’s breast; but
10481,THE GARDENER,the officer’s wife came out quickly from a little bedroom behind the
10482,THE GARDENER,"office, and the three of them lifted the woman on to the cot."
10483,THE GARDENER,
10484,THE GARDENER,"“They are often like this,” said the officer’s wife, loosening the"
10485,THE GARDENER,tight bonnet-strings. “Yesterday she said he’d been killed at Hooge.
10486,THE GARDENER,Are you sure you know your grave? It makes such a difference.”
10487,THE GARDENER,
10488,THE GARDENER,"“Yes, thank you,” said Helen, and hurried out before the woman on the"
10489,THE GARDENER,bed should begin to lament again.
10490,THE GARDENER,
10491,THE GARDENER,*       *       *       *       *
10492,THE GARDENER,
10493,THE GARDENER,"Tea in a crowded mauve and blue striped wooden structure, with a false"
10494,THE GARDENER,"front, carried her still further into the nightmare. She paid her bill"
10495,THE GARDENER,"beside a stolid, plain-featured Englishwoman, who, hearing her inquire"
10496,THE GARDENER,"about the train to Hagenzeele, volunteered to come with her."
10497,THE GARDENER,
10498,THE GARDENER,"“I’m going to Hagenzeele myself,” she explained. “Not to Hagenzeele"
10499,THE GARDENER,"Third; mine is Sugar Factory, but they call it La Rosière now. It’s"
10500,THE GARDENER,just south of Hagenzeele Three. Have you got your room at the hotel
10501,THE GARDENER,there?”
10502,THE GARDENER,
10503,THE GARDENER,"“Oh yes, thank you. I’ve wired.”"
10504,THE GARDENER,
10505,THE GARDENER,"“That’s better. Sometimes the place is quite full, and at others"
10506,THE GARDENER,there’s hardly a soul. But they’ve put bathrooms into the old Lion
10507,THE GARDENER,d’Or--that’s the hotel on the west side of Sugar Factory--and it draws
10508,THE GARDENER,"off a lot of people, luckily.”"
10509,THE GARDENER,
10510,THE GARDENER,“It’s all new to me. This is the first time I’ve been over.”
10511,THE GARDENER,
10512,THE GARDENER,“Indeed! This is my ninth time since the Armistice. Not on my own
10513,THE GARDENER,"account. _I_ haven’t lost any one, thank God--but, like every one else,"
10514,THE GARDENER,"I’ve a lot of friends at home who have. Coming over as often as I do,"
10515,THE GARDENER,I find it helps them to have some one just look at the--the place and
10516,THE GARDENER,"tell them about it afterwards. And one can take photos for them, too."
10517,THE GARDENER,I get quite a list of commissions to execute.” She laughed nervously
10518,THE GARDENER,and tapped her slung Kodak. “There are two or three to see at Sugar
10519,THE GARDENER,"Factory this time, and plenty of others in the cemeteries all about. My"
10520,THE GARDENER,"system is to save them up, and arrange them, you know. And when I’ve"
10521,THE GARDENER,"got enough commissions for one area to make it worth while, I pop over"
10522,THE GARDENER,and execute them. It _does_ comfort people.”
10523,THE GARDENER,
10524,THE GARDENER,"“I suppose so,” Helen answered, shivering as they entered the little"
10525,THE GARDENER,train.
10526,THE GARDENER,
10527,THE GARDENER,“Of course it does. (Isn’t it lucky we’ve got window-seats?) It must
10528,THE GARDENER,"do or they wouldn’t ask one to do it, would they? I’ve a list of quite"
10529,THE GARDENER,twelve or fifteen commissions here”--she tapped the Kodak again--“I
10530,THE GARDENER,"must sort them out to-night. Oh, I forgot to ask you. What’s yours?”"
10531,THE GARDENER,
10532,THE GARDENER,"“My nephew,” said Helen. “But I was very fond of him.”"
10533,THE GARDENER,
10534,THE GARDENER,“Ah yes! I sometimes wonder whether _they_ know after death? What do
10535,THE GARDENER,you think?”
10536,THE GARDENER,
10537,THE GARDENER,"“Oh, I don’t--I haven’t dared to think much about that sort of thing,”"
10538,THE GARDENER,"said Helen, almost lifting her hands to keep her off."
10539,THE GARDENER,
10540,THE GARDENER,"“Perhaps that’s better,” the woman answered. “The sense of loss must be"
10541,THE GARDENER,"enough, I expect. Well, I won’t worry you any more.”"
10542,THE GARDENER,
10543,THE GARDENER,"Helen was grateful, but when they reached the hotel Mrs. Scarsworth"
10544,THE GARDENER,(they had exchanged names) insisted on dining at the same table
10545,THE GARDENER,"with her, and after the meal, in the little, hideous salon full of"
10546,THE GARDENER,"low-voiced relatives, took Helen through her “commissions” with"
10547,THE GARDENER,"biographies of the dead, where she happened to know them, and sketches"
10548,THE GARDENER,"of their next of kin. Helen endured till nearly half-past nine, ere she"
10549,THE GARDENER,fled to her room.
10550,THE GARDENER,
10551,THE GARDENER,Almost at once there was a knock at her door and Mrs. Scarsworth
10552,THE GARDENER,"entered; her hands, holding the dreadful list, clasped before her."
10553,THE GARDENER,
10554,THE GARDENER,"“Yes--yes--_I_ know,” she began. “You’re sick of me, but I want to"
10555,THE GARDENER,tell you something. You--you aren’t married are you? Then perhaps you
10556,THE GARDENER,won’t.... But it doesn’t matter. I’ve _got_ to tell some one. I can’t
10557,THE GARDENER,go on any longer like this.”
10558,THE GARDENER,
10559,THE GARDENER,"“But please----” Mrs. Scarsworth had backed against the shut door, and"
10560,THE GARDENER,her mouth worked dryly.
10561,THE GARDENER,
10562,THE GARDENER,"“In a minute,” she said. “You--you know about these graves of mine"
10563,THE GARDENER,"I was telling you about downstairs, just now? They really _are_"
10564,THE GARDENER,commissions. At least several of them are.” Her eye wandered round the
10565,THE GARDENER,"room. “What extraordinary wall-papers they have in Belgium, don’t you"
10566,THE GARDENER,"think?... Yes. I swear they are commissions. But there’s _one_, d’you"
10567,THE GARDENER,"see, and--and he was more to me than anything else in the world. Do"
10568,THE GARDENER,you understand?”
10569,THE GARDENER,
10570,THE GARDENER,Helen nodded.
10571,THE GARDENER,
10572,THE GARDENER,"“More than any one else. And, of course, he oughtn’t to have been. He"
10573,THE GARDENER,ought to have been nothing to me. But he _was_. He _is_. That’s why I
10574,THE GARDENER,"do the commissions, you see. That’s all.”"
10575,THE GARDENER,
10576,THE GARDENER,“But why do you tell me?” Helen asked desperately.
10577,THE GARDENER,
10578,THE GARDENER,“Because I’m _so_ tired of lying. Tired of lying--always lying--year
10579,THE GARDENER,in and year out. When I don’t tell lies I’ve got to act ’em and I’ve
10580,THE GARDENER,"got to think ’em, always. _You_ don’t know what that means. He was"
10581,THE GARDENER,everything to me that he oughtn’t to have been--the one real thing--the
10582,THE GARDENER,only thing that ever happened to me in all my life; and I’ve had to
10583,THE GARDENER,"pretend he wasn’t. I’ve had to watch every word I said, and think out"
10584,THE GARDENER,"what lie I’d tell next, for years and years!”"
10585,THE GARDENER,
10586,THE GARDENER,“How many years?” Helen asked.
10587,THE GARDENER,
10588,THE GARDENER,"“Six years and four months before, and two and three-quarters after."
10589,THE GARDENER,"I’ve gone to him eight times, since. To-morrow’ll make the ninth,"
10590,THE GARDENER,and--and I can’t--I _can’t_ go to him again with nobody in the world
10591,THE GARDENER,knowing. I want to be honest with some one before I go. Do you
10592,THE GARDENER,"understand? It doesn’t matter about _me_. I was never truthful, even as"
10593,THE GARDENER,a girl. But it isn’t worthy of _him_. So--so I--I had to tell you. I
10594,THE GARDENER,"can’t keep it up any longer. Oh, I can’t!”"
10595,THE GARDENER,
10596,THE GARDENER,"She lifted her joined hands almost to the level of her mouth, and"
10597,THE GARDENER,"brought them down sharply, still joined, to full arms’ length below her"
10598,THE GARDENER,"waist. Helen reached forward, caught them, bowed her head over them,"
10599,THE GARDENER,"and murmured: “Oh, my dear! My dear!” Mrs. Scarsworth stepped back, her"
10600,THE GARDENER,face all mottled.
10601,THE GARDENER,
10602,THE GARDENER,“My God!” said she. “Is _that_ how you take it?”
10603,THE GARDENER,
10604,THE GARDENER,"Helen could not speak, the woman went out; but it was a long while"
10605,THE GARDENER,before Helen was able to sleep.
10606,THE GARDENER,
10607,THE GARDENER,*       *       *       *       *
10608,THE GARDENER,
10609,THE GARDENER,"Next morning Mrs. Scarsworth left early on her round of commissions,"
10610,THE GARDENER,and Helen walked alone to Hagenzeele Third. The place was still in
10611,THE GARDENER,"the making, and stood some five or six feet above the metalled road,"
10612,THE GARDENER,which it flanked for hundreds of yards. Culverts across a deep ditch
10613,THE GARDENER,served for entrances through the unfinished boundary wall. She climbed
10614,THE GARDENER,a few wooden-faced earthen steps and then met the entire crowded level
10615,THE GARDENER,of the thing in one held breath. She did not know that Hagenzeele
10616,THE GARDENER,Third counted twenty-one thousand dead already. All she saw was a
10617,THE GARDENER,"merciless sea of black crosses, bearing little strips of stamped tin"
10618,THE GARDENER,at all angles across their faces. She could distinguish no order or
10619,THE GARDENER,arrangement in their mass; nothing but a waist-high wilderness as of
10620,THE GARDENER,"weeds stricken dead, rushing at her. She went forward, moved to the"
10621,THE GARDENER,"left and the right hopelessly, wondering by what guidance she should"
10622,THE GARDENER,ever come to her own. A great distance away there was a line of
10623,THE GARDENER,whiteness. It proved to be a block of some two or three hundred graves
10624,THE GARDENER,"whose headstones had already been set, whose flowers were planted out,"
10625,THE GARDENER,and whose new-sown grass showed green. Here she could see clear-cut
10626,THE GARDENER,"letters at the ends of the rows, and, referring to her slip, realised"
10627,THE GARDENER,that it was not here she must look.
10628,THE GARDENER,
10629,THE GARDENER,"A man knelt behind a line of headstones--evidently a gardener, for he"
10630,THE GARDENER,"was firming a young plant in the soft earth. She went towards him,"
10631,THE GARDENER,her paper in her hand. He rose at her approach and without prelude or
10632,THE GARDENER,salutation asked: “Who are you looking for?”
10633,THE GARDENER,
10634,THE GARDENER,"“Lieutenant Michael Turrell--my nephew,” said Helen slowly and word for"
10635,THE GARDENER,"word, as she had many thousands of times in her life."
10636,THE GARDENER,
10637,THE GARDENER,The man lifted his eyes and looked at her with infinite compassion
10638,THE GARDENER,before he turned from the fresh-sown grass towards the naked black
10639,THE GARDENER,crosses.
10640,THE GARDENER,
10641,THE GARDENER,"“Come with me,” he said, “and I will show you where your son lies.”"

10644,THE GARDENER,
10645,THE GARDENER,When Helen left the Cemetery she turned for a last look. In the
10646,THE GARDENER,distance she saw the man bending over his young plants; and she went
10647,THE GARDENER,"away, supposing him to be the gardener."
