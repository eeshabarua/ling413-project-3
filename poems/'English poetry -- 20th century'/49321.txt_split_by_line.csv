291,THE MOON'S MESSAGE,
292,THE MOON'S MESSAGE,"And she looked at my open letter,"
293,THE MOON'S MESSAGE,"And called from her couch on high,"

301,ON A BATTLE FIELD,
302,ON A BATTLE FIELD,
303,ON A BATTLE FIELD,"Once o'er this hill whereon we stand,"
304,ON A BATTLE FIELD,"Just you and I, hand clasp'd in hand"
305,ON A BATTLE FIELD,"Amid the silence, and the space,"
306,ON A BATTLE FIELD,"A mighty battle rent the air,"
307,ON A BATTLE FIELD,With dying curse and choking prayer;
308,ON A BATTLE FIELD,'Mid shot and shell death stalked apace.
309,ON A BATTLE FIELD,
310,ON A BATTLE FIELD,Is it conceivable to you—
311,ON A BATTLE FIELD,So much at peace—because we two
312,ON A BATTLE FIELD,"Are close together, or to me?"
313,ON A BATTLE FIELD,The silent beauty of the noon
314,ON A BATTLE FIELD,"Seems like a Heaven-granted boon,"
315,ON A BATTLE FIELD,Aglow with tender ecstasy.
316,ON A BATTLE FIELD,
317,ON A BATTLE FIELD,A little mist of hazy blue
318,ON A BATTLE FIELD,Is slowly hiding from our view
319,ON A BATTLE FIELD,"The city's domes and slender spires,"
320,ON A BATTLE FIELD,As thro' a bridal veil the sun
321,ON A BATTLE FIELD,Subdued and shy lights one by one
322,ON A BATTLE FIELD,The virgin clouds with blushing fires.
323,ON A BATTLE FIELD,
324,ON A BATTLE FIELD,The wind has fallen; very low
325,ON A BATTLE FIELD,"We hear his wings brush past, and know"
326,ON A BATTLE FIELD,He creeps away to dream and rest;
327,ON A BATTLE FIELD,"How sweet to be alone, to feel"
328,ON A BATTLE FIELD,"You breathe one longing sigh, and steal"
329,ON A BATTLE FIELD,A little closer to my breast.
330,ON A BATTLE FIELD,
331,ON A BATTLE FIELD,Is anything worth while but this?
332,ON A BATTLE FIELD,"We may not perish for a kiss,"
333,ON A BATTLE FIELD,Yet thus it were not hard to die!
334,ON A BATTLE FIELD,"War strews the earth with countless dead,"
335,ON A BATTLE FIELD,"And after all is done and said,"
336,ON A BATTLE FIELD,"The end is love, and you and I!"

359,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,
360,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,
361,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"To-day the still, deep mind of the Earth"
362,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"Has steeped in longing her wistful eyes,"
363,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,A sense of wonder and glad surprise
364,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,Thrills thro' her heart with a thought of birth.
365,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,
366,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"The grave All-Mother looks up and smiles,"
367,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"Her breath comes balmy from sunlit mouth,"
368,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,Her bosom bare to the ardent south
369,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,Is fanned by perfume from fruitful miles.
370,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,
371,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,All winter long has the dear Earth slept
372,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"In drifts of snow, 'neath the bane of frost,"
373,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"Her children sought for the Mother lost,"
374,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"Yet found her not, and in anguish wept."
375,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,
376,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,All winter long have my senses cried
377,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"For warmth of sun, and the blue of sky,"
378,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"The hard north answered to mock my sigh,"
379,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,And all the glory of life denied.
380,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,
381,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"The cold mists drifting on land and sea,"
382,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"Like ghosts of passions burnt out and chill,"
383,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"Smote heart and soul with the fear of ill,"
384,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,That cast its awfulness over me.
385,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,
386,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"The dank gray sails, and the dank gray shore,"
387,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"They melted each in the other's face,"
388,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"With clammy kiss, in a wan embrace"
389,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,That left them colder than e'en before.
390,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,
391,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,And thro' the boughs of the moss-grown trees
392,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"The sap flowed sluggish, or not at all,"
393,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"While here and there would a dead leaf fall,"
394,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,Like thought of harrowing memories.
395,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,
396,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,Then from the heart of the Universe
397,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"There rose a wail of unending woe,"
398,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,An anguished prayer from the deeps below:
399,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"""Oh! Mother, lift from our souls the curse!"""
400,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,
401,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"""Oh! Mother, quicken thy sacred womb,"
402,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"With fire that throbs in the veins of Spring,"
403,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"Behold the numbness of everything,"
404,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"And only thou can avert the doom."""
405,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,
406,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"""Oh! Mother, hear us!"" But silent still"
407,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"The Earth slept on, as it were in death."
408,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"Her ice-bound bosom stirred not with breath,"
409,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,So fast she lay 'neath the winter's will.
410,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,
411,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"I joined my prayer to the wind and trees,"
412,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"I joined my cry to the striving soil,"
413,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"I said, ""Oh! Mother, our endless toil"
414,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,Has made us sicken with miseries.
415,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,
416,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"""Rise up! and help us again to live,"
417,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"Rise up! uncover thy fruitful breast,"
418,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"We faint in winter's unrestful rest,"
419,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"We burn with longings to love and give."""
420,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,
421,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,And as I spoke came a voice more strong
422,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"Than all creation's, o'er land and sea"
423,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"It called our Mother to ecstasy,"
424,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"And lo! she stirred, who had slept so long."
425,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,
426,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"She stirred, she opened her drowsy eyes,"
427,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"And bending down from the dome above,"
428,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,"Beheld the form of embodied Love,"
429,THE ALL-MOTHER'S AWAKENING,As Spring stepped Earthward from Paradise.

439,A SUMMER THOUGHT,"Vague yearnings such as solitude inspires,"
440,A SUMMER THOUGHT,"That nameless something silence can impart,"
441,A SUMMER THOUGHT,
442,A SUMMER THOUGHT,"Could after all be quenched by simple things,"

1218,BROTHER FILIPPO,"I know not what the tongue she spake,"

2663,II,White lilies make a background for your slim
2664,II,"Young body. Let the blinds be up, and night"
2665,II,"Gaze through the windows with her purple eyes,"
2666,II,Dropping some ardent star from out its height
2667,II,For very eagerness of glad surprise
2668,II,"At so much beauty, till your song's delight"
2669,II,Shall waft it back into the listening skies!

2673,III,
2674,III,Where shall I find a corner in this room
2675,III,Almost in darkness? Ah! that deep recess
2676,III,"Of languid cushions, eager to caress"
2677,III,My weary limbs! from out its dreaming gloom
2678,III,"Made holy by the incense of perfume,"
2679,III,All unobserved and happy I'll confess
2680,III,"My senses to those roses, passionless,"
2681,III,And listening in their bowl of silver doom.
2682,III,"Sing, sing, sweet friend, but soft, though eagerly!"
2683,III,With tender pauses in between the notes
2684,III,"Filled up with little sighs, unconsciously—"
2685,III,"These rose-dropped petals, they are fairy boats"
2686,III,Our souls may sail on lakes of melody
2687,III,Adown whose ripples youth eternal floats.

2691,IV,
2692,IV,Oh! burning silence! when the very air
2693,IV,Is warm with memories of sounds we love!
2694,IV,"You cease to sing, yet from below, above,"
2695,IV,"Around me, in me, of me, everywhere,"
2696,IV,"That Music's spirit, tremulously fair"
2697,IV,"Flutters and flutters, like a wounded dove,"
2698,IV,And cannot fly beyond this earthly groove!
2699,IV,"Midway it pauses, hanging throbbing there."
2700,IV,"I will not speak, lest it should seem profane"
2701,IV,In such a presence; idle words of praise
2702,IV,"Ye are but mortal sounds, with no refrain"
2703,IV,"That can endure beyond our passing days,"
2704,IV,And so be silent! silent with the pain
2705,IV,"Of all deep feeling, that can find no phrase."

2710,V,"Kiss me good night, sweet minstrel, on the stairs!"
2711,V,"I love your lips, they're neither pale nor red,"
2712,V,"But like an after-glow, when day lies dead"
2713,V,"Upon the mountains. Do they say soft prayers,"
2714,V,"Those languid lips? to God, a God who cares,"
2715,V,And gathers such dear follies thread by thread
2716,V,"As each is woven in your mind, and shed"
2717,V,Like gold spun silk upon His field of tares?
2718,V,"You're silent! let it pass; who knows but you,"
2719,V,"So strong in weakness, may compel God's ear"
2720,V,To listen for the smallest drop of dew
2721,V,That all our thunders would disdain to hear:
2722,V,"And so, Sweet, _if_ you pray, repeat anew"
2723,V,"To God, that while you sang I wept a tear!"

2727,VI,
2728,VI,This morning while I light my cigarette
2729,VI,In this dim study with its endless view
2730,VI,Stretching away to hills whose eyes are blue
2731,VI,"With secret thoughts, _my_ thoughts are all regret,"
2732,VI,Regret for broken interludes! and yet—
2733,VI,"If it were otherwise, who knows but you"
2734,VI,"Might grow to pall, as things familiar do,"
2735,VI,While now it seems worth while to not forget!
2736,VI,"And so good-bye, my friend, drift out in smoke,"
2737,VI,"Vague, and intangible, a fleeting joy"
2738,VI,"That some stray match of fate in passing woke,"
2739,VI,"To burn awhile, like this small soothing toy"
2740,VI,Between my lips: Time's galling iron yoke
2741,VI,"Is not for us, we made and we'll destroy."
