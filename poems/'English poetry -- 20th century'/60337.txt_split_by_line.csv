230,PEACH,
231,PEACH,Why was not my peach round and finished like a billiard ball?
232,PEACH,It would have been if man had made it.
233,PEACH,Though I’ve eaten it now.
234,PEACH,

248,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,Delicious rottenness.
249,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,
250,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,I love to suck you out from your skins
251,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"So brown and soft and coming suave,"
252,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"So morbid, as the Italians say."
253,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,
254,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"What a rare, powerful, reminiscent flavour"
255,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,Comes out of your falling through the stages of decay:
256,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,Stream within stream.
257,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,
258,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,Something of the same flavour as Syracusan muscat wine
259,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,Or vulgar Marsala.
260,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,
261,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,Though even the word Marsala will smack of preciosity
262,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,Soon in the pussy-foot West.

267,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"Wineskins of brown morbidity,"
268,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,Autumnal excrementa;
269,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,What is it that reminds us of white gods?
270,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,
271,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"Gods nude as blanched nut-kernels,"
272,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"Strangely, half-sinisterly flesh-fragrant"
273,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"As if with sweat,"
274,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,And drenched with mystery.
275,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,
276,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"Sorb-apples, medlars with dead crowns."

281,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,
282,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"A kiss, and a vivid spasm of farewell, a moment’s orgasm of rupture,"
283,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"Then along the damp road alone, till the next turning."
284,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"And there, a new partner, a new parting, a new unfusing into twain,"
285,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"A new gasp of further isolation,"
286,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"A new intoxication of loneliness, among decaying, frost-cold leaves."
287,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,
288,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"Going down the strange lanes of hell, more and more intensely alone,"
289,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,The fibres of the heart parting one after the other
290,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"And yet the soul continuing, naked-footed, ever more vividly embodied"
291,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,Like a flame blown whiter and whiter
292,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,In a deeper and deeper darkness
293,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"Ever more exquisite, distilled in separation."
294,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,
295,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"So, in the strange retorts of medlars and sorb-apples"
296,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,The distilled essence of hell.
297,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,The exquisite odour of leave-taking.
298,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,_Jamque vale!_
299,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"Orpheus, and the winding, leaf-clogged, silent lanes of hell."
300,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,
301,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"Each soul departing with its own isolation,"
302,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"Strangest of all strange companions,"
303,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,And best.
304,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,
305,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"Medlars, sorb-apples"
306,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,More than sweet
307,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,Flux of autumn
308,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,Sucked out of your empty bladders
309,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"And sipped down, perhaps, with a sip of Marsala"
310,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"So that the rambling, sky-dropped grape can add its music to yours,"
311,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,"Orphic farewell, and farewell, and farewell"
312,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,And the _ego sum_ of Dionysos
313,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,The _sono io_ of perfect drunkenness
314,MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES,Intoxication of final loneliness.

329,FIGS,"Which is just like a four-sepalled calyx,"
330,FIGS,After you have taken off the blossom with your lips.

335,FIGS,
336,FIGS,Every fruit has its secret.
337,FIGS,
338,FIGS,The fig is a very secretive fruit.
339,FIGS,"As you see it standing growing, you feel at once it is symbolic:"
340,FIGS,And it seems male.
341,FIGS,"But when you come to know it better, you agree"
342,FIGS,"with the Romans, it is female."
343,FIGS,
344,FIGS,"The Italians vulgarly say, it stands for the female part; the fig-fruit:"
345,FIGS,"The fissure, the yoni,"
346,FIGS,The wonderful moist conductivity towards the centre.
347,FIGS,
348,FIGS,"Involved,"
349,FIGS,"Inturned,"
350,FIGS,The flowering all inward and womb-fibrilled;
351,FIGS,And but one orifice.
352,FIGS,
353,FIGS,"The fig, the horse-shoe, the squash-blossom."
354,FIGS,Symbols.
355,FIGS,
356,FIGS,"There was a flower that flowered inward, womb-ward;"
357,FIGS,Now there is a fruit like a ripe womb.
358,FIGS,
359,FIGS,It was always a secret.
360,FIGS,"That’s how it should be, the female should always be secret."
361,FIGS,
362,FIGS,There never was any standing aloft and unfolded on a bough
363,FIGS,"Like other flowers, in a revelation of petals;"
364,FIGS,"Silver-pink peach, Venetian green glass of medlars and sorb-apples,"
365,FIGS,"Shallow wine-cups on short, bulging stems"

368,FIGS,"The brave, adventurous rosaceæ."
369,FIGS,
370,FIGS,"Folded upon itself, and secret unutterable,"

372,FIGS,"Sap that smells strange on your fingers, that even goats won’t taste it;"
373,FIGS,"Folded upon itself, enclosed like any Mohammedan woman,"
374,FIGS,"Its nakedness all within-walls, its flowering forever unseen,"
375,FIGS,"One small way of access only, and this close-curtained from the light;"
376,FIGS,"Fig, fruit of the female mystery, covert and inward,"
377,FIGS,"Mediterranean fruit, with your covert nakedness,"
378,FIGS,"Where everything happens invisible, flowering and"
379,FIGS,"fertilisation, and fruiting"
380,FIGS,"In the inwardness of your you, that eye will never see"
381,FIGS,"Till it’s finished, and you’re over-ripe, and you"
382,FIGS,burst to give up your ghost.
383,FIGS,
384,FIGS,"Till the drop of ripeness exudes,"
385,FIGS,And the year is over.
386,FIGS,
387,FIGS,And then the fig has kept her secret long enough.
388,FIGS,"So it explodes, and you see through the fissure the scarlet."
389,FIGS,"And the fig is finished, the year is over."
390,FIGS,
391,FIGS,"That’s how the fig dies, showing her crimson through the purple slit"
392,FIGS,"Like a wound, the exposure of her secret, on the open day."
393,FIGS,"Like a prostitute, the bursten fig, making a show of her secret."
394,FIGS,
395,FIGS,That’s how women die too.
396,FIGS,
397,FIGS,"The year is fallen over-ripe,"
398,FIGS,The year of our women.
399,FIGS,The year of our women is fallen over-ripe.
400,FIGS,The secret is laid bare.
401,FIGS,And rottenness soon sets in.
402,FIGS,The year of our women is fallen over-ripe.
403,FIGS,
404,FIGS,When Eve once knew _in her mind_ that she was naked
405,FIGS,"She quickly sewed fig-leaves, and sewed the same for the man."
406,FIGS,"She’d been naked all her days before,"
407,FIGS,"But till then, till that apple of knowledge, she hadn’t"
408,FIGS,had the fact on her mind.
409,FIGS,
410,FIGS,"She got the fact on her mind, and quickly sewed fig-leaves."
411,FIGS,And women have been sewing ever since.
412,FIGS,"But now they stitch to adorn the bursten fig, not to cover it."
413,FIGS,"They have their nakedness more than ever on their mind,"
414,FIGS,And they won’t let us forget it.
415,FIGS,
416,FIGS,"Now, the secret"
417,FIGS,"Becomes an affirmation through moist, scarlet lips"
418,FIGS,That laugh at the Lord’s indignation.
419,FIGS,
420,FIGS,"_What then, good Lord!_ cry the women."
421,FIGS,_We have kept our secret long enough._
422,FIGS,_We are a ripe fig._
423,FIGS,_Let us burst into affirmation._
424,FIGS,
425,FIGS,"They forget, ripe figs won’t keep."
426,FIGS,Ripe figs won’t keep.
427,FIGS,
428,FIGS,"Honey-white figs of the north, black figs"
429,FIGS,"with scarlet inside, of the south."
430,FIGS,"Ripe figs won’t keep, won’t keep in any clime."
431,FIGS,"What then, when women the world over have all bursten into affirmation?"
432,FIGS,And bursten figs won’t keep?

811,CYPRESSES,
812,CYPRESSES,Folded in like a dark thought
813,CYPRESSES,"For which the language is lost,"
814,CYPRESSES,"Tuscan cypresses,"
815,CYPRESSES,Is there a great secret?
816,CYPRESSES,Are our words no good?
817,CYPRESSES,
818,CYPRESSES,"The undeliverable secret,"
819,CYPRESSES,"Dead with a dead race and a dead speech, and yet"
820,CYPRESSES,"Darkly monumental in you,"
821,CYPRESSES,Etruscan cypresses.
822,CYPRESSES,
823,CYPRESSES,"Ah, how I admire your fidelity,"
824,CYPRESSES,"Dark cypresses,"
825,CYPRESSES,
826,CYPRESSES,Is it the secret of the long-nosed Etruscans?
827,CYPRESSES,"The long-nosed, sensitive-footed, subtly-smiling Etruscans,"
828,CYPRESSES,Who made so little noise outside the cypress groves?
829,CYPRESSES,
830,CYPRESSES,"Among the sinuous, flame-tall cypresses"
831,CYPRESSES,That swayed their length of darkness all around
832,CYPRESSES,"Etruscan-dusky, wavering men of old Etruria:"
833,CYPRESSES,"Naked except for fanciful long shoes,"
834,CYPRESSES,"Going with insidious, half-smiling quietness"
835,CYPRESSES,And some of Africa’s imperturbable sang-froid
836,CYPRESSES,About a forgotten business.
837,CYPRESSES,
838,CYPRESSES,"What business, then?"
839,CYPRESSES,"Nay, tongues are dead, and words are hollow as hollow seed-pods,"
840,CYPRESSES,Having shed their sound and finished all their echoing
841,CYPRESSES,"Etruscan syllables,"
842,CYPRESSES,That had the telling.
843,CYPRESSES,
844,CYPRESSES,"Yet more I see you darkly concentrate,"
845,CYPRESSES,"Tuscan cypresses,"
846,CYPRESSES,On one old thought:
847,CYPRESSES,"On one old slim imperishable thought, while you remain"
848,CYPRESSES,Etruscan cypresses;
849,CYPRESSES,"Dusky, slim marrow-thought of slender, flickering men of Etruria,"
850,CYPRESSES,Whom Rome called vicious.
851,CYPRESSES,
852,CYPRESSES,"Vicious, dark cypresses:"
853,CYPRESSES,"Vicious, you supple, brooding, softly-swaying pillars of dark flame."
854,CYPRESSES,"Monumental to a dead, dead race"
855,CYPRESSES,Embalmed in you!
856,CYPRESSES,
857,CYPRESSES,"Were they then vicious, the slender, tender-footed,"
858,CYPRESSES,Long-nosed men of Etruria?
859,CYPRESSES,"Or was their way only evasive and different, dark, like cypress-trees"
860,CYPRESSES,in a wind?
861,CYPRESSES,
862,CYPRESSES,"They are dead, with all their vices,"
863,CYPRESSES,And all that is left
864,CYPRESSES,Is the shadowy monomania of some cypresses
865,CYPRESSES,And tombs.
866,CYPRESSES,
867,CYPRESSES,"The smile, the subtle Etruscan smile still lurking"
868,CYPRESSES,"Within the tombs,"
869,CYPRESSES,Etruscan cypresses.
870,CYPRESSES,He laughs longest who laughs last;
871,CYPRESSES,"Nay, Leonardo only bungled the pure Etruscan smile."
872,CYPRESSES,
873,CYPRESSES,What would I not give
874,CYPRESSES,To bring back the rare and orchid-like
875,CYPRESSES,Evil-yclept Etruscan?
876,CYPRESSES,
877,CYPRESSES,For as to the evil
878,CYPRESSES,"We have only Roman word for it,"
879,CYPRESSES,"Which I, being a little weary of Roman virtue,"
880,CYPRESSES,Don’t hang much weight on.
881,CYPRESSES,
882,CYPRESSES,"For oh, I know, in the dust where we have buried"
883,CYPRESSES,"The silenced races and all their abominations,"
884,CYPRESSES,We have buried so much of the delicate magic of life.
885,CYPRESSES,
886,CYPRESSES,There in the deeps
887,CYPRESSES,"That churn the frankincense and ooze the myrrh,"
888,CYPRESSES,"Cypress shadowy,"
889,CYPRESSES,Such an aroma of lost human life!
890,CYPRESSES,
891,CYPRESSES,"They say the fit survive,"
892,CYPRESSES,But I invoke the spirits of the lost.
893,CYPRESSES,"Those that have not survived, the darkly lost,"
894,CYPRESSES,"To bring their meaning back into life again,"
895,CYPRESSES,Which they have taken away
896,CYPRESSES,"And wrapt inviolable in soft cypress-trees,"
897,CYPRESSES,Etruscan cypresses.
898,CYPRESSES,
899,CYPRESSES,"Evil, what is evil?"
900,CYPRESSES,"There is only one evil, to deny life"
901,CYPRESSES,As Rome denied Etruria
902,CYPRESSES,And mechanical America Montezuma still.

1575,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,_That I salute the red hibiscus flowers
1576,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,And send mankind to its inferior blazes._
1577,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"Mankind’s inferior blazes,"
1578,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"And these along with it, all the inferior lot--"
1579,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"These bolshevists,"
1580,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"These dog-fish,"
1581,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"These precious and ideal ones,"
1582,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,All rubbish ready for fire.
1583,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,And I salute hibiscus and the salvia flower
1584,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"Upon the breasts of loutish bolshevists,"
1585,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"Damned loutish bolshevists,"
1586,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"Who perhaps will do the business after all,"
1587,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"In the long run, in spite of themselves."
1588,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,
1589,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"Meanwhile, alas"
1590,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"For me no fellow-men,"
1591,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"No salvia-frenzied comrades, antennæ"
1592,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"Of yellow-red, outreaching, living wrath"
1593,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"Upon the smouldering air,"
1594,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,And throat of brimstone-molten angry gold.
1595,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"Red, angry men are a race extinct, alas!"
1596,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,
1597,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,Never
1598,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,To be a bolshevist
1599,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,With a hibiscus flower behind my ear
1600,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"In sign of life, of lovely, dangerous life"
1601,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,And passionate disqualify of men;
1602,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"In sign of dauntless, silent violets,"
1603,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"And impudent nettles grabbing the under-earth,"
1604,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"And cabbages born to be cut and eat,"
1605,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"And salvia fierce to crow and shout for fight,"
1606,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,And rosy-red hibiscus wincingly
1607,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,Unfolding all her coiled and lovely self
1608,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,In a doubtful world.
1609,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,
1610,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"Never, bolshevistically"
1611,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,To be able to stand for all these!
1612,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"Alas, alas, I have got to leave it all"
1613,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,To the youths in Sunday suits and yellow shoes
1614,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,Who have pulled down the salvia flowers
1615,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,And rosy delicate hibiscus flowers
1616,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"And everything else to their disgusting level,"
1617,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"Never, of course, to put anything up again."
1618,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,
1619,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,But yet
1620,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"If they pull all the world down,"
1621,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,The process will amount to the same in the end.
1622,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,Instead of flame and flame-clean ash
1623,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,Slow watery rotting back to level muck
1624,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,"And final humus,"
1625,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,Whence the re-start.
1626,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,
1627,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,And still I cannot bear it
1628,HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS,That they take hibiscus and the salvia flower.

1643,ST MATTHEW,"One is a man, for example, and one is a bird."
1644,ST MATTHEW,
1645,ST MATTHEW,"I, Matthew, am a man."
1646,ST MATTHEW,
1647,ST MATTHEW,"“And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me”--"
1648,ST MATTHEW,
1649,ST MATTHEW,That is Jesus.
1650,ST MATTHEW,But then Jesus was not quite a man.
1651,ST MATTHEW,He was the Son of Man
1652,ST MATTHEW,"Filius Meus, O remorseless logic"
1653,ST MATTHEW,Out of His own mouth.
1654,ST MATTHEW,
1655,ST MATTHEW,"I, Matthew, being a man"
1656,ST MATTHEW,"Cannot be lifted up, the Paraclete"
1657,ST MATTHEW,"To draw all men unto me,"
1658,ST MATTHEW,Seeing I am on a par with all men.
1659,ST MATTHEW,
1660,ST MATTHEW,"I, on the other hand,"
1661,ST MATTHEW,"Am drawn to the Uplifted, as all men are drawn,"
1662,ST MATTHEW,To the Son of Man
1663,ST MATTHEW,_Filius Meus_.
1664,ST MATTHEW,
1665,ST MATTHEW,"_Wilt thou lift me up, Son of Man?_"
1666,ST MATTHEW,How my heart beats!
1667,ST MATTHEW,I am man.
1668,ST MATTHEW,
1669,ST MATTHEW,"I am man, and therefore my heart beats, and throws the dark blood from side"
1670,ST MATTHEW,to side
1671,ST MATTHEW,All the time I am lifted up.
1672,ST MATTHEW,"Yes, even during my uplifting."
1673,ST MATTHEW,
1674,ST MATTHEW,And if it ceased?
1675,ST MATTHEW,"If it ceased, I should be no longer man"
1676,ST MATTHEW,"As I am, if my heart in uplifting ceased to beat, to toss the dark"
1677,ST MATTHEW,"blood from side to side, causing my myriad secret streams."
1678,ST MATTHEW,
1679,ST MATTHEW,After the cessation
1680,ST MATTHEW,"I might be a soul in bliss, an angel, approximating to the Uplifted;"
1681,ST MATTHEW,But that is another matter;
1682,ST MATTHEW,"I am Matthew, the man,"
1683,ST MATTHEW,And I am not that other angelic matter.
1684,ST MATTHEW,
1685,ST MATTHEW,"So I will be lifted up, Saviour,"
1686,ST MATTHEW,"But put me down again in time, Master,"
1687,ST MATTHEW,"Before my heart stops beating, and I become what I am not."
1688,ST MATTHEW,"Put me down again on the earth, Jesus, on the brown soil"
1689,ST MATTHEW,"Where flowers sprout in the acrid humus, and fade into humus again."
1690,ST MATTHEW,"Where beasts drop their unlicked young, and pasture, and drop"
1691,ST MATTHEW,their droppings among the turf.
1692,ST MATTHEW,Where the adder darts horizontal.
1693,ST MATTHEW,"Down on the damp, unceasing ground, where my feet belong"
1694,ST MATTHEW,"And even my heart, Lord, forever, after all uplifting:"
1695,ST MATTHEW,"The crumbling, damp, fresh land, life horizontal and ceaseless."
1696,ST MATTHEW,
1697,ST MATTHEW,"Matthew I am, the man."
1698,ST MATTHEW,"And I take the wings of the morning, to Thee, Crucified, Glorified."
1699,ST MATTHEW,But while flowers club their petals at evening
1700,ST MATTHEW,And rabbits make pills among the short grass
1701,ST MATTHEW,"And long snakes quickly glide into the dark hole in the wall, hearing man"
1702,ST MATTHEW,"approach,"
1703,ST MATTHEW,"I must be put down, Lord, in the afternoon,"
1704,ST MATTHEW,And at evening I must leave off my wings of the spirit
1705,ST MATTHEW,As I leave off my braces
1706,ST MATTHEW,"And I must resume my nakedness like a fish, sinking down the dark reversion"

1710,ΙΧΘΥΣ,Face downwards
1711,ΙΧΘΥΣ,Veering slowly
1712,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"Down between the steep slopes of darkness, fucus-dark, seaweed-fringed"
1713,ΙΧΘΥΣ,valleys of the waters under the sea
1714,ΙΧΘΥΣ,Over the edge of the soundless cataract
1715,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"Into the fathomless, bottomless pit"
1716,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"Where my soul falls in the last throes of bottomless convulsion, and is"
1717,ΙΧΘΥΣ,fallen
1718,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"Utterly beyond Thee, Dove of the Spirit;"
1719,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"Beyond everything, except itself."
1720,ΙΧΘΥΣ,
1721,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"Nay, Son of Man, I have been lifted up."
1722,ΙΧΘΥΣ,To Thee I rose like a rocket ending in mid-heaven.
1723,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"But even Thou, Son of Man, canst not quaff out the dregs of terrestrial"
1724,ΙΧΘΥΣ,manhood!
1725,ΙΧΘΥΣ,They fall back from Thee.
1726,ΙΧΘΥΣ,
1727,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"They fall back, and like a dripping of quicksilver taking the downward track,"
1728,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"Break into drops, burn into drops of blood, and dropping, dropping take"
1729,ΙΧΘΥΣ,wing
1730,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"Membraned, blood-veined wings."
1731,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"On fans of unsuspected tissue, like bats"
1732,ΙΧΘΥΣ,They thread and thrill and flicker ever downward
1733,ΙΧΘΥΣ,To the dark zenith of Thine antipodes
1734,ΙΧΘΥΣ,Jesus Uplifted.
1735,ΙΧΘΥΣ,
1736,ΙΧΘΥΣ,Bat-winged heart of man
1737,ΙΧΘΥΣ,Reversed flame
1738,ΙΧΘΥΣ,Shuddering a strange way down the bottomless pit
1739,ΙΧΘΥΣ,To the great depths of its reversèd zenith.
1740,ΙΧΘΥΣ,
1741,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"Afterwards, afterwards"
1742,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"Morning comes, and I shake the dews of night from the wings of my spirit"
1743,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"And mount like a lark, Beloved."
1744,ΙΧΘΥΣ,
1745,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"But remember, Saviour,"
1746,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"That my heart which like a lark at heaven’s gate singing, hovers"
1747,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"morning-bright to Thee,"
1748,ΙΧΘΥΣ,Throws still the dark blood back and forth
1749,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"In the avenues where the bat hangs sleeping, upside-down"
1750,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"And to me undeniable, Jesus."
1751,ΙΧΘΥΣ,
1752,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"Listen, Paraclete."
1753,ΙΧΘΥΣ,I can no more deny the bat-wings of my fathom-flickering spirit of darkness
1754,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"Than the wings of the Morning and Thee, Thou Glorified."
1755,ΙΧΘΥΣ,
1756,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"I am Matthew, the Man:"
1757,ΙΧΘΥΣ,It is understood.
1758,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"And Thou art Jesus, Son of Man"
1759,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"Drawing all men unto Thee, but bound to release them when the hour strikes."
1760,ΙΧΘΥΣ,
1761,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"I have been, and I have returned."
1762,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"I have mounted up on the wings of the morning, and I have dredged down to"
1763,ΙΧΘΥΣ,the zenith’s reversal.
1764,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"Which is my way, being man."
1765,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"Gods may stay in mid-heaven, the Son of Man has climbed to the Whitsun zenith,"
1766,ΙΧΘΥΣ,"But I, Matthew, being a man"
1767,ΙΧΘΥΣ,Am a traveller back and forth.
1768,ΙΧΘΥΣ,So be it.

1773,ST MARK,ST MARK
1774,ST MARK,
1775,ST MARK,
1776,ST MARK,There was a lion in Judah
1777,ST MARK,"Which whelped, and was Mark."
1778,ST MARK,
1779,ST MARK,But winged.
1780,ST MARK,A lion with wings.
1781,ST MARK,At least at Venice.
1782,ST MARK,Even as late as Daniele Manin.
1783,ST MARK,
1784,ST MARK,Why should he have wings?
1785,ST MARK,Is he to be a bird also?
1786,ST MARK,Or a spirit?
1787,ST MARK,Or a winged thought?
1788,ST MARK,Or a soaring consciousness?
1789,ST MARK,
1790,ST MARK,Evidently he is all that
1791,ST MARK,The lion of the spirit.
1792,ST MARK,
1793,ST MARK,"Ah, Lamb of God"
1794,ST MARK,"Would a wingless lion lie down before Thee, as this winged lion lies?"
1795,ST MARK,
1796,ST MARK,The lion of the spirit.
1797,ST MARK,
1798,ST MARK,Once he lay in the mouth of a cave
1799,ST MARK,"And sunned his whiskers,"
1800,ST MARK,"And lashed his tail slowly, slowly"
1801,ST MARK,Thinking of voluptuousness
1802,ST MARK,Even of blood.
1803,ST MARK,
1804,ST MARK,"But later, in the sun of the afternoon"
1805,ST MARK,"Having tasted all there was to taste, and having slept his fill"
1806,ST MARK,"He fell to frowning, as he lay with his head on his paws"
1807,ST MARK,And the sun coming in through the narrowest fibril of a slit in his eyes.
1808,ST MARK,
1809,ST MARK,"So, nine-tenths asleep, motionless, bored, and statically angry,"
1810,ST MARK,"He saw in a shaft of light a lamb on a pinnacle, balancing a flag"
1811,ST MARK,"on its paw,"
1812,ST MARK,And he was thoroughly startled.
1813,ST MARK,
1814,ST MARK,Going out to investigate
1815,ST MARK,"He found the lamb beyond him, on the inaccessible pinnacle of light."
1816,ST MARK,"So he put his paw to his nose, and pondered."
1817,ST MARK,
1818,ST MARK,"“Guard my sheep,” came the silvery voice from the pinnacle,"
1819,ST MARK,“And I will give thee the wings of the morning.”
1820,ST MARK,So the lion of the senses thought it was worth it.
1821,ST MARK,
1822,ST MARK,Hence he became a curly sheep-dog with dangerous propensities
1823,ST MARK,As Carpaccio will tell you:
1824,ST MARK,"Ramping round, guarding the flock of mankind,"
1825,ST MARK,"Sharpening his teeth on the wolves,"
1826,ST MARK,Ramping up through the air like a kestrel
1827,ST MARK,And lashing his tail above the world
1828,ST MARK,And enjoying the sensation of heaven and righteousness and voluptuous wrath.
1829,ST MARK,
1830,ST MARK,There is a new sweetness in his voluptuously licking his paw
1831,ST MARK,Now that it is a weapon of heaven.
1832,ST MARK,There is a new ecstasy in his roar of desirous love
1833,ST MARK,Now that it sounds self-conscious through the unlimited sky.
1834,ST MARK,He is well aware of himself
1835,ST MARK,"And he cherishes voluptuous delights, and thinks about them"
1836,ST MARK,And ceases to be a blood-thirsty king of beasts
1837,ST MARK,"And becomes the faithful sheep-dog of the Shepherd, thinking of"
1838,ST MARK,his voluptuous pleasures of chasing the sheep to the fold
1839,ST MARK,"And increasing the flock, and perhaps giving a real nip here and there,"
1840,ST MARK,"a real pinch, but always well meant."
1841,ST MARK,
1842,ST MARK,And somewhere there is a lioness
1843,ST MARK,The she-mate.
1844,ST MARK,Whelps play between the paws of the lion
1845,ST MARK,The she-mate purrs
1846,ST MARK,"Their castle is impregnable, their cave,"
1847,ST MARK,"The sun comes in their lair, they are well-off"
1848,ST MARK,A well-to-do family.
1849,ST MARK,
1850,ST MARK,"Then the proud lion stalks abroad, alone"
1851,ST MARK,And roars to announce himself to the wolves
1852,ST MARK,And also to encourage the red-cross Lamb
1853,ST MARK,And also to ensure a goodly increase in the world.
1854,ST MARK,
1855,ST MARK,"Look at him, with his paw on the world"
1856,ST MARK,At Venice and elsewhere.
1857,ST MARK,Going blind at last.
1858,ST MARK,
1859,ST MARK,
1860,ST MARK,
1861,ST MARK,
1862,ST LUKE,ST LUKE
1863,ST LUKE,
1864,ST LUKE,
1865,ST LUKE,"A wall, a bastion,"
1866,ST LUKE,A living forehead with its slow whorl of hair
1867,ST LUKE,"And a bull’s large, sombre, glancing eye"
1868,ST LUKE,"And glistening, adhesive muzzle"
1869,ST LUKE,With cavernous nostrils where the winds run hot
1870,ST LUKE,Snorting defiance
1871,ST LUKE,Or greedily snuffling behind the cows.
1872,ST LUKE,
1873,ST LUKE,Horns
1874,ST LUKE,"The golden horns of power,"
1875,ST LUKE,"Power to kill, power to create"
1876,ST LUKE,"Such as Moses had, and God,"
1877,ST LUKE,Head-power.
1878,ST LUKE,
1879,ST LUKE,Shall great wings flame from his shoulder-sockets
1880,ST LUKE,Assyrian-wise?
1881,ST LUKE,It would be no wonder.
1882,ST LUKE,
1883,ST LUKE,Knowing the thunder of his heart
1884,ST LUKE,The massive thunder of his dew-lapped chest
1885,ST LUKE,"Deep and reverberating,"
1886,ST LUKE,"It would be no wonder if great wings, like flame, fanned out from"
1887,ST LUKE,the furnace-cracks of his shoulder-sockets.
1888,ST LUKE,
1889,ST LUKE,Thud! Thud! Thud!
1890,ST LUKE,And the roar of black bull’s blood in the mighty passages of his chest.
1891,ST LUKE,
1892,ST LUKE,"Ah, the dewlap swings pendulous with excess."
1893,ST LUKE,"The great, roaring weight above"
1894,ST LUKE,Like a furnace dripping a molten drip.
1895,ST LUKE,
1896,ST LUKE,"The urge, the massive, burning ache"
1897,ST LUKE,Of the bull’s breast.
1898,ST LUKE,The open furnace-doors of his nostrils.
1899,ST LUKE,
1900,ST LUKE,"For what does he ache, and groan?"
1901,ST LUKE,
1902,ST LUKE,In his breast a wall?
1903,ST LUKE,
1904,ST LUKE,"Nay, once it was also a fortress wall, and the weight of a vast battery."
1905,ST LUKE,"But now it is a burning hearthstone only,"
1906,ST LUKE,Massive old altar of his own burnt offering.
1907,ST LUKE,
1908,ST LUKE,It was always an altar of burnt offering
1909,ST LUKE,His own black blood poured out like a sheet of flame over his fecundating
1910,ST LUKE,herd
1911,ST LUKE,As he gave himself forth.
1912,ST LUKE,
1913,ST LUKE,But also it was a fiery fortress frowning shaggily on the world
1914,ST LUKE,And announcing battle ready.
1915,ST LUKE,
1916,ST LUKE,Since the Lamb bewitched him with that red-struck flag
1917,ST LUKE,His fortress is dismantled
1918,ST LUKE,His fires of wrath are banked down
1919,ST LUKE,His horns turn away from the enemy.
1920,ST LUKE,
1921,ST LUKE,He serves the Son of Man.
1922,ST LUKE,
1923,ST LUKE,"And hear him bellow, after many years, the bull that serves the Son of Man."
1924,ST LUKE,"Moaning, booing, roaring hollow"
1925,ST LUKE,Constrained to pour forth all his fire down the narrow sluice of procreation
1926,ST LUKE,"Through such narrow loins, too narrow."
1927,ST LUKE,
1928,ST LUKE,Is he not over-charged by the dammed-up pressure of his own massive black
1929,ST LUKE,blood
1930,ST LUKE,"Luke, the Bull, the father of substance, the Providence Bull, after two"
1931,ST LUKE,thousand years?
1932,ST LUKE,"Is he not over-full of offering, a vast, vast offer of himself"
1933,ST LUKE,Which must be poured through so small a vent?
1934,ST LUKE,
1935,ST LUKE,Too small a vent.
1936,ST LUKE,
1937,ST LUKE,"Let him remember his horns, then."
1938,ST LUKE,"Seal up his forehead once more to a bastion,"
1939,ST LUKE,Let it know nothing.
1940,ST LUKE,"Let him charge like a mighty catapult on the red-cross flag, let him roar"
1941,ST LUKE,out challenge on the world
1942,ST LUKE,"And throwing himself upon it, throw off the madness of his blood."
1943,ST LUKE,Let it be war.
1944,ST LUKE,
1945,ST LUKE,And so it is war.
1946,ST LUKE,The bull of the proletariat has got his head down.

1996,ST JOHN,"On two wings, like a pair of compasses;"
1997,ST JOHN,"Jesus’ pale and lambent dove, cooing in the lower boughs"
1998,ST JOHN,On sufferance.
1999,ST JOHN,
2000,ST JOHN,"In the beginning was the Word, of course."
2001,ST JOHN,"And the word was the first offspring of the almighty Johannine mind,"
2002,ST JOHN,Chick of the intellectual eagle.
2003,ST JOHN,
2004,ST JOHN,Yet put salt on the tail of the Johannine bird
2005,ST JOHN,Put salt on its tail
2006,ST JOHN,John’s eagle.
2007,ST JOHN,
2008,ST JOHN,Shoo it down out of the empyrean
2009,ST JOHN,"Of the all-seeing, all-fore-ordaining ideal."
2010,ST JOHN,"Make it roost on bird-spattered, rocky Patmos"
2011,ST JOHN,"And let it moult there, among the stones of the bitter sea."
2012,ST JOHN,
2013,ST JOHN,For the almighty eagle of the fore-ordaining Mind
2014,ST JOHN,Is looking rather shabby and island-bound these days:
2015,ST JOHN,"Moulting, and rather naked about the rump, and down in the beak,"
2016,ST JOHN,"Rather dirty, on dung-whitened Patmos."
2017,ST JOHN,
2018,ST JOHN,From which we are led to assume
2019,ST JOHN,"That the old bird is weary, and almost willing"
2020,ST JOHN,That a new chick should chip the extensive shell
2021,ST JOHN,Of the mundane egg.
2022,ST JOHN,
2023,ST JOHN,The poor old golden eagle of the creative spirit
2024,ST JOHN,"Moulting and moping and waiting, willing at last"
2025,ST JOHN,"For the fire to burn it up, feathers and all"
2026,ST JOHN,So that a new conception of the beginning and end
2027,ST JOHN,Can rise from the ashes.
2028,ST JOHN,
2029,ST JOHN,"Ah Phœnix, Phœnix"
2030,ST JOHN,John’s Eagle!
2031,ST JOHN,You are only known to us now as the badge of an insurance Company.
2032,ST JOHN,
2033,ST JOHN,"Phœnix, Phœnix"
2034,ST JOHN,The nest is in flames
2035,ST JOHN,"Feathers are singeing,"
2036,ST JOHN,"Ash flutters flocculent, like down on a blue, wan fledgeling."

2051,THE MOSQUITO,Monsieur?
2052,THE MOSQUITO,
2053,THE MOSQUITO,What do you stand on such high legs for?
2054,THE MOSQUITO,Why this length of shredded shank
2055,THE MOSQUITO,You exaltation?
2056,THE MOSQUITO,
2057,THE MOSQUITO,Is it so that you shall lift your centre of gravity upwards
2058,THE MOSQUITO,"And weigh no more than air as you alight upon me,"
2059,THE MOSQUITO,"Stand upon me weightless, you phantom?"
2060,THE MOSQUITO,
2061,THE MOSQUITO,I heard a woman call you the Winged Victory
2062,THE MOSQUITO,In sluggish Venice.
2063,THE MOSQUITO,"You turn your head towards your tail, and smile."
2064,THE MOSQUITO,
2065,THE MOSQUITO,How can you put so much devilry
2066,THE MOSQUITO,Into that translucent phantom shred
2067,THE MOSQUITO,Of a frail corpus?
2068,THE MOSQUITO,
2069,THE MOSQUITO,"Queer, with your thin wings and your streaming legs"
2070,THE MOSQUITO,"How you sail like a heron, or a dull clot of air,"
2071,THE MOSQUITO,A nothingness.
2072,THE MOSQUITO,
2073,THE MOSQUITO,Yet what an aura surrounds you;
2074,THE MOSQUITO,"Your evil little aura, prowling, and casting a numbness on my mind."
2075,THE MOSQUITO,
2076,THE MOSQUITO,"That is your trick, your bit of filthy magic:"
2077,THE MOSQUITO,"Invisibility, and the anæsthetic power"
2078,THE MOSQUITO,To deaden my attention in your direction.
2079,THE MOSQUITO,
2080,THE MOSQUITO,"But I know your game now, streaky sorcerer."
2081,THE MOSQUITO,
2082,THE MOSQUITO,"Queer, how you stalk and prowl the air"
2083,THE MOSQUITO,"In circles and evasions, enveloping me,"
2084,THE MOSQUITO,Ghoul on wings
2085,THE MOSQUITO,Winged Victory.
2086,THE MOSQUITO,
2087,THE MOSQUITO,"Settle, and stand on long thin shanks"
2088,THE MOSQUITO,"Eyeing me sideways, and cunningly conscious that I am aware,"
2089,THE MOSQUITO,You speck.
2090,THE MOSQUITO,
2091,THE MOSQUITO,I hate the way you lurch off sideways into air
2092,THE MOSQUITO,Having read my thoughts against you.
2093,THE MOSQUITO,
2094,THE MOSQUITO,"Come then, let us play at unawares,"
2095,THE MOSQUITO,And see who wins in this sly game of bluff.
2096,THE MOSQUITO,Man or mosquito.
2097,THE MOSQUITO,

2099,THE MOSQUITO,Now then!
2100,THE MOSQUITO,
2101,THE MOSQUITO,It is your trump
2102,THE MOSQUITO,It is your hateful little trump
2103,THE MOSQUITO,"You pointed fiend,"
2104,THE MOSQUITO,Which shakes my sudden blood to hatred of you:
2105,THE MOSQUITO,"It is your small, high, hateful bugle in my ear."
2106,THE MOSQUITO,
2107,THE MOSQUITO,Why do you do it?
2108,THE MOSQUITO,Surely it is bad policy.
2109,THE MOSQUITO,
2110,THE MOSQUITO,They say you can’t help it.
2111,THE MOSQUITO,
2112,THE MOSQUITO,"If that is so, then I believe a little in Providence protecting the innocent."
2113,THE MOSQUITO,But it sounds so amazingly like a slogan
2114,THE MOSQUITO,A yell of triumph as you snatch my scalp.
2115,THE MOSQUITO,
2116,THE MOSQUITO,"Blood, red blood"
2117,THE MOSQUITO,Super-magical
2118,THE MOSQUITO,Forbidden liquor.

2121,THE MOSQUITO,"For a second enspasmed in oblivion,"
2122,THE MOSQUITO,Obscenely ecstasied
2123,THE MOSQUITO,Sucking live blood
2124,THE MOSQUITO,My blood.
2125,THE MOSQUITO,
2126,THE MOSQUITO,"Such silence, such suspended transport,"
2127,THE MOSQUITO,"Such gorging,"
2128,THE MOSQUITO,Such obscenity of trespass.
2129,THE MOSQUITO,
2130,THE MOSQUITO,You stagger
2131,THE MOSQUITO,As well as you may.
2132,THE MOSQUITO,Only your accursed hairy frailty
2133,THE MOSQUITO,Your own imponderable weightlessness
2134,THE MOSQUITO,"Saves you, wafts you away on the very draught my anger makes in its snatching."
2135,THE MOSQUITO,
2136,THE MOSQUITO,Away with a pæan of derision
2137,THE MOSQUITO,You winged blood-drop.
2138,THE MOSQUITO,
2139,THE MOSQUITO,Can I not overtake you?
2140,THE MOSQUITO,Are you one too many for me
2141,THE MOSQUITO,Winged Victory?
2142,THE MOSQUITO,Am I not mosquito enough to out-mosquito you?
2143,THE MOSQUITO,
2144,THE MOSQUITO,"Queer, what a big stain my sucked blood makes"
2145,THE MOSQUITO,Beside the infinitesimal faint smear of you!

2157,FISH,

2159,FISH,"Or whether the waters wilt in the hollow places,"
2160,FISH,All one to you.
2161,FISH,
2162,FISH,"Aqueous, subaqueous,"
2163,FISH,Submerged
2164,FISH,And wave-thrilled.
2165,FISH,
2166,FISH,As the waters roll
2167,FISH,Roll you.
2168,FISH,"The waters wash,"
2169,FISH,You wash in oneness
2170,FISH,And never emerge.
2171,FISH,
2172,FISH,"Never know,"
2173,FISH,Never grasp.
2174,FISH,
2175,FISH,"Your life a sluice of sensation along your sides,"
2176,FISH,"A flush at the flails of your fins, down the whorl of your tail,"
2177,FISH,And water wetly on fire in the grates of your gills;
2178,FISH,Fixed water-eyes.
2179,FISH,
2180,FISH,Even snakes lie together.
2181,FISH,
2182,FISH,"But oh, fish, that rock in water,"
2183,FISH,You lie only with the waters;
2184,FISH,One touch.
2185,FISH,
2186,FISH,"No fingers, no hands and feet, no lips;"
2187,FISH,"No tender muzzles,"
2188,FISH,"No wistful bellies,"
2189,FISH,"No loins of desire,"
2190,FISH,None.
2191,FISH,
2192,FISH,"You and the naked element,"
2193,FISH,Sway-wave.
2194,FISH,Curvetting bits of tin in the evening light.
2195,FISH,
2196,FISH,Who is it ejects his sperm to the naked flood?
2197,FISH,In the wave-mother?
2198,FISH,Who swims enwombed?
2199,FISH,"Who lies with the waters of his silent passion, womb-element?"
2200,FISH,--Fish in the waters under the earth.
2201,FISH,
2202,FISH,What price _his_ bread upon the waters?
2203,FISH,
2204,FISH,Himself all silvery himself
2205,FISH,In the element
2206,FISH,No more.
2207,FISH,
2208,FISH,Nothing more.
2209,FISH,
2210,FISH,"Himself,"
2211,FISH,And the element.
2212,FISH,"Food, of course!"
2213,FISH,"Water-eager eyes,"
2214,FISH,Mouth-gate open
2215,FISH,"And strong spine urging, driving;"
2216,FISH,And desirous belly gulping.
2217,FISH,
2218,FISH,Fear also!
2219,FISH,He knows fear!
2220,FISH,"Water-eyes craning,"
2221,FISH,"A rush that almost screams,"
2222,FISH,Almost fish-voice
2223,FISH,As the pike comes....
2224,FISH,"Then gay fear, that turns the tail sprightly, from a shadow."
2225,FISH,
2226,FISH,"Food, and fear, and joie de vivre,"
2227,FISH,Without love.
2228,FISH,
2229,FISH,The other way about:
2230,FISH,"Joie de vivre, and fear, and food,"
2231,FISH,All without love.
2232,FISH,
2233,FISH,Quelle joie de vivre
2234,FISH,Dans l’eau!
2235,FISH,"Slowly to gape through the waters,"
2236,FISH,Alone with the element;
2237,FISH,"To sink, and rise, and go to sleep with the waters;"
2238,FISH,To speak endless inaudible wavelets into the wave;
2239,FISH,"To breathe from the flood at the gills,"
2240,FISH,"Fish-blood slowly running next to the flood, extracting fish-fire;"
2241,FISH,"To have the element under one, like a lover;"
2242,FISH,"And to spring away with a curvetting click in the air,"
2243,FISH,Provocative.
2244,FISH,Dropping back with a slap on the face of the flood.
2245,FISH,And merging oneself!
2246,FISH,
2247,FISH,To be a fish!
2248,FISH,
2249,FISH,So utterly without misgiving
2250,FISH,To be a fish
2251,FISH,In the waters.
2252,FISH,
2253,FISH,"Loveless, and so lively!"
2254,FISH,"Born before God was love,"
2255,FISH,Or life knew loving.
2256,FISH,Beautifully beforehand with it all.
2257,FISH,
2258,FISH,"Admitted, they swarm in companies,"
2259,FISH,Fishes.
2260,FISH,They drive in shoals.
2261,FISH,"But soundless, and out of contact."
2262,FISH,"They exchange no word, no spasm, not even anger."
2263,FISH,Not one touch.
2264,FISH,"Many suspended together, forever apart,"
2265,FISH,"Each one alone with the waters, upon one wave with the rest."
2266,FISH,
2267,FISH,A magnetism in the water between them only.
2268,FISH,
2269,FISH,"I saw a water-serpent swim across the Anapo,"
2270,FISH,"And I said to my heart, _look, look at him!_"
2271,FISH,"_With his head up, steering like a bird!_"
2272,FISH,"_He’s a rare one, but he belongs ..._"
2273,FISH,
2274,FISH,But sitting in a boat on the Zeller lake
2275,FISH,And watching the fishes in the breathing waters
2276,FISH,Lift and swim and go their way--
2277,FISH,
2278,FISH,"I said to my heart, _who are these?_"
2279,FISH,And my heart couldn’t own them....
2280,FISH,
2281,FISH,"A slim young pike, with smart fins"
2282,FISH,"And grey-striped suit, a young cub of a pike"
2283,FISH,"Slouching along away below, half out of sight,"
2284,FISH,Like a lout on an obscure pavement....
2285,FISH,
2286,FISH,"Aha, there’s somebody in the know!"
2287,FISH,
2288,FISH,But watching closer
2289,FISH,"That motionless deadly motion,"
2290,FISH,"That unnatural barrel body, that long ghoul nose, ..."
2291,FISH,I left off hailing him.
2292,FISH,
2293,FISH,"I had made a mistake, I didn’t know him,"
2294,FISH,"This grey, monotonous soul in the water,"
2295,FISH,"This intense individual in shadow,"
2296,FISH,Fish-alive.
2297,FISH,
2298,FISH,"I didn’t know his God,"
2299,FISH,I didn’t know his God.
2300,FISH,
2301,FISH,Which is perhaps the last admission that life has to wring out of us.
2302,FISH,
2303,FISH,"I saw, dimly,"
2304,FISH,"Once a big pike rush,"
2305,FISH,And small fish fly like splinters.
2306,FISH,"And I said to my heart, _there are limits_"
2307,FISH,"_To you, my heart;_"
2308,FISH,_And to the one God._
2309,FISH,_Fish are beyond me._
2310,FISH,
2311,FISH,Other Gods
2312,FISH,Beyond my range ... gods beyond my God ...
2313,FISH,
2314,FISH,"They are beyond me, are fishes."
2315,FISH,I stand at the pale of my being
2316,FISH,"And look beyond, and see"
2317,FISH,"Fish, in the outerwards,"
2318,FISH,As one stands on a bank and looks in.
2319,FISH,
2320,FISH,I have waited with a long rod
2321,FISH,"And suddenly pulled a gold-and-greenish, lucent fish from below,"
2322,FISH,"And had him fly like a halo round my head,"
2323,FISH,Lunging in the air on the line.
2324,FISH,
2325,FISH,"Unhooked his gorping, water-horny mouth,"
2326,FISH,"And seen his horror-tilted eye,"
2327,FISH,"His red-gold, water-precious, mirror-flat bright eye;"
2328,FISH,"And felt him beat in my hand, with his mucous, leaping life-throb."
2329,FISH,
2330,FISH,And my heart accused itself
2331,FISH,Thinking: _I am not the measure of creation._
2332,FISH,"_This is beyond me, this fish._"
2333,FISH,_His God stands outside my God._
2334,FISH,
2335,FISH,"And the gold-and-green pure lacquer-mucus comes off in my hand,"
2336,FISH,"And the red-gold mirror-eye stares and dies,"
2337,FISH,And the water-suave contour dims.
2338,FISH,
2339,FISH,But not before I have had to know
2340,FISH,"He was born in front of my sunrise,"
2341,FISH,Before my day.
2342,FISH,
2343,FISH,He outstarts me.
2344,FISH,"And I, a many-fingered horror of daylight to him,"
2345,FISH,Have made him die.
2346,FISH,
2347,FISH,"Fishes,"
2348,FISH,"With their gold, red eyes, and green-pure gleam, and under-gold,"
2349,FISH,"And their pre-world loneliness,"
2350,FISH,"And more-than-lovelessness,"
2351,FISH,And white meat;
2352,FISH,They move in other circles.
2353,FISH,
2354,FISH,Outsiders.
2355,FISH,Water-wayfarers.
2356,FISH,Things of one element.
2357,FISH,"Aqueous,"
2358,FISH,Each by itself.
2359,FISH,
2360,FISH,"Cats, and the Neapolitans,"
2361,FISH,"Sulphur sun-beasts,"
2362,FISH,Thirst for fish as for more-than-water;
2363,FISH,Water-alive
2364,FISH,To quench their over-sulphureous lusts.
2365,FISH,
2366,FISH,"But I, I only wonder"
2367,FISH,And don’t know.
2368,FISH,I don’t know fishes.
2369,FISH,
2370,FISH,In the beginning

2486,MAN AND BAT,"Fumbling, a beast in air,"
2487,MAN AND BAT,"And stumbling, lunging and touching the walls, the bell-wires"
2488,MAN AND BAT,About my room!
2489,MAN AND BAT,
2490,MAN AND BAT,Always refusing to go out into the air
2491,MAN AND BAT,"Above that crash-gulf of the Via de’ Bardi,"
2492,MAN AND BAT,"Yet blind with frenzy, with cluttered fear."
2493,MAN AND BAT,
2494,MAN AND BAT,"At last he swerved into the window bay,"
2495,MAN AND BAT,"But blew back, as if an incoming wind blew him in again."
2496,MAN AND BAT,A strong inrushing wind.
2497,MAN AND BAT,
2498,MAN AND BAT,And round and round and round!
2499,MAN AND BAT,"Blundering more insane, and leaping, in throbs, to clutch at a corner,"
2500,MAN AND BAT,"At a wire, at a bell-rope:"
2501,MAN AND BAT,"On and on, watched relentless by me, round and round in my room,"
2502,MAN AND BAT,Round and round and dithering with tiredness and haste and increasing delirium
2503,MAN AND BAT,Flicker-splashing round my room.
2504,MAN AND BAT,
2505,MAN AND BAT,I would not let him rest;
2506,MAN AND BAT,"Not one instant cleave, cling like a blot with his breast to the wall"
2507,MAN AND BAT,In an obscure corner.
2508,MAN AND BAT,Not an instant!
2509,MAN AND BAT,
2510,MAN AND BAT,"I flicked him on,"
2511,MAN AND BAT,Trying to drive him through the window.
2512,MAN AND BAT,
2513,MAN AND BAT,Again he swerved into the window bay
2514,MAN AND BAT,"And I ran forward, to frighten him forth."
2515,MAN AND BAT,"But he rose, and from a terror worse than me he flew past me"
2516,MAN AND BAT,"Back into my room, and round, round, round in my room"
2517,MAN AND BAT,"Clutch, cleave, stagger,"
2518,MAN AND BAT,Dropping about the air
2519,MAN AND BAT,Getting tired.
2520,MAN AND BAT,
2521,MAN AND BAT,Something seemed to blow him back from the window
2522,MAN AND BAT,Every time he swerved at it;
2523,MAN AND BAT,"Back on a strange parabola, then round, round, dizzy in my room."
2524,MAN AND BAT,
2525,MAN AND BAT,"He _could_ not go out,"
2526,MAN AND BAT,I also realised....
2527,MAN AND BAT,"It was the light of day which he could not enter,"
2528,MAN AND BAT,Any more than I could enter the white-hot door of a blast-furnace.
2529,MAN AND BAT,
2530,MAN AND BAT,He could not plunge into the daylight that streamed at the window.
2531,MAN AND BAT,It was asking too much of his nature.
2532,MAN AND BAT,
2533,MAN AND BAT,Worse even than the hideous terror of me with my handkerchief
2534,MAN AND BAT,"Saying: _Out, go out!..._"
2535,MAN AND BAT,Was the horror of white daylight in the window!
2536,MAN AND BAT,
2537,MAN AND BAT,"So I switched on the electric light, thinking: _Now_"
2538,MAN AND BAT,_The outside will seem brown...._
2539,MAN AND BAT,
2540,MAN AND BAT,But no.
2541,MAN AND BAT,The outside did not seem brown.
2542,MAN AND BAT,And he did not mind the yellow electric light.
2543,MAN AND BAT,
2544,MAN AND BAT,Silent!
2545,MAN AND BAT,He was having a silent rest.
2546,MAN AND BAT,_But never!_
2547,MAN AND BAT,_Not in my room._
2548,MAN AND BAT,
2549,MAN AND BAT,Round and round and round
2550,MAN AND BAT,"Near the ceiling as if in a web,"
2551,MAN AND BAT,Staggering;
2552,MAN AND BAT,"Plunging, falling out of the web,"
2553,MAN AND BAT,"Broken in heaviness,"
2554,MAN AND BAT,"Lunging blindly,"
2555,MAN AND BAT,Heavier;
2556,MAN AND BAT,"And clutching, clutching for one second’s pause,"
2557,MAN AND BAT,"Always, as if for one drop of rest,"
2558,MAN AND BAT,One little drop.
2559,MAN AND BAT,
2560,MAN AND BAT,And I!
2561,MAN AND BAT,"_Never_, I say...."
2562,MAN AND BAT,_Go out!_
2563,MAN AND BAT,
2564,MAN AND BAT,"Flying slower,"
2565,MAN AND BAT,"Seeming to stumble, to fall in air."
2566,MAN AND BAT,Blind-weary.
2567,MAN AND BAT,
2568,MAN AND BAT,Yet never able to pass the whiteness of light into freedom ...
2569,MAN AND BAT,"A bird would have dashed through, come what might."
2570,MAN AND BAT,
2571,MAN AND BAT,"Fall, sink, lurch, and round and round"
2572,MAN AND BAT,"Flicker, flicker-heavy;"
2573,MAN AND BAT,Even wings heavy:
2574,MAN AND BAT,"And cleave in a high corner for a second, like a clot, also a prayer."
2575,MAN AND BAT,
2576,MAN AND BAT,_But no._
2577,MAN AND BAT,"_Out, you beast._"
2578,MAN AND BAT,
2579,MAN AND BAT,"Till he fell in a corner, palpitating, spent."
2580,MAN AND BAT,"And there, a clot, he squatted and looked at me."
2581,MAN AND BAT,"With sticking-out, bead-berry eyes, black,"
2582,MAN AND BAT,"And improper derisive ears,"
2583,MAN AND BAT,"And shut wings,"
2584,MAN AND BAT,"And brown, furry body."
2585,MAN AND BAT,
2586,MAN AND BAT,"Brown, nut-brown, fine fur!"
2587,MAN AND BAT,But it might as well have been hair on a spider; thing
2588,MAN AND BAT,"With long, black-paper ears."
2589,MAN AND BAT,
2590,MAN AND BAT,"So, a dilemma!"
2591,MAN AND BAT,He squatted there like something unclean.
2592,MAN AND BAT,
2593,MAN AND BAT,"No, he must not squat, nor hang, obscene, in my room!"
2594,MAN AND BAT,
2595,MAN AND BAT,Yet nothing on earth will give him courage to pass the sweet fire of day.
2596,MAN AND BAT,
2597,MAN AND BAT,What then?
2598,MAN AND BAT,Hit him and kill him and throw him away?
2599,MAN AND BAT,
2600,MAN AND BAT,"Nay,"
2601,MAN AND BAT,I didn’t create him.
2602,MAN AND BAT,Let the God that created him be responsible for his death ...
2603,MAN AND BAT,"Only, in the bright day, I will not have this clot in my room."
2604,MAN AND BAT,
2605,MAN AND BAT,Let the God who is maker of bats watch with them in their unclean corners....
2606,MAN AND BAT,"I admit a God in every crevice,"
2607,MAN AND BAT,But not bats in my room;
2608,MAN AND BAT,"Nor the God of bats, while the sun shines."
2609,MAN AND BAT,
2610,MAN AND BAT,"_So out, out you brute!..._"
2611,MAN AND BAT,"And he lunged, flight-heavy, away from me, sideways, _a sghembo_!"
2612,MAN AND BAT,"And round and round and round my room, a clot with wings,"
2613,MAN AND BAT,Impure even in weariness.
2614,MAN AND BAT,
2615,MAN AND BAT,"Wings dark skinny and flapping the air,"
2616,MAN AND BAT,Lost their flicker.
2617,MAN AND BAT,Spent.
2618,MAN AND BAT,
2619,MAN AND BAT,He fell again with a little thud
2620,MAN AND BAT,Near the curtain on the floor.
2621,MAN AND BAT,And there lay.
2622,MAN AND BAT,
2623,MAN AND BAT,"Ah death, death"
2624,MAN AND BAT,You are no solution!
2625,MAN AND BAT,Bats must be bats.
2626,MAN AND BAT,
2627,MAN AND BAT,Only life has a way out.
2628,MAN AND BAT,And the human soul is fated to wide-eyed responsibility
2629,MAN AND BAT,In life.
2630,MAN AND BAT,
2631,MAN AND BAT,"So I picked him up in a flannel jacket,"
2632,MAN AND BAT,"Well covered, lest he should bite me."
2633,MAN AND BAT,"For I would have had to kill him if he’d bitten me, the impure one...."
2634,MAN AND BAT,"And he hardly stirred in my hand, muffled up."
2635,MAN AND BAT,
2636,MAN AND BAT,"Hastily, I shook him out of the window."
2637,MAN AND BAT,
2638,MAN AND BAT,And away he went!
2639,MAN AND BAT,Fear craven in his tail.
2640,MAN AND BAT,"Great haste, and straight, almost bird straight above the Via de’ Bardi."
2641,MAN AND BAT,"Above that crash-gulf of exploding whips,"
2642,MAN AND BAT,Towards the Borgo San Jacopo.
2643,MAN AND BAT,
2644,MAN AND BAT,"And now, at evening, as he flickers over the river"
2645,MAN AND BAT,"Dipping with petty triumphant flight, and tittering over the sun’s departure,"
2646,MAN AND BAT,"I believe he chirps, pipistrello, seeing me here on this terrace writing:"
2647,MAN AND BAT,"_There he sits, the long loud one!_"
2648,MAN AND BAT,_But I am greater than he ..._
2649,MAN AND BAT,_I escaped him...._

2663,SNAKE,A snake came to my water-trough
2664,SNAKE,"On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,"
2665,SNAKE,To drink there.
2666,SNAKE,
2667,SNAKE,"In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob-tree"
2668,SNAKE,I came down the steps with my pitcher
2669,SNAKE,"And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the trough before"
2670,SNAKE,me.
2671,SNAKE,
2672,SNAKE,He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom
2673,SNAKE,"And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over the edge"
2674,SNAKE,of the stone trough
2675,SNAKE,"And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,"
2676,SNAKE,"And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness,"
2677,SNAKE,"He sipped with his straight mouth,"
2678,SNAKE,"Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,"
2679,SNAKE,Silently.
2680,SNAKE,
2681,SNAKE,"Someone was before me at my water-trough,"
2682,SNAKE,"And I, like a second comer, waiting."
2683,SNAKE,
2684,SNAKE,"He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,"
2685,SNAKE,"And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,"
2686,SNAKE,"And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused a moment,"
2687,SNAKE,"And stooped and drank a little more,"
2688,SNAKE,"Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels of the earth"
2689,SNAKE,"On the day of Sicilian July, with Etna smoking."
2690,SNAKE,
2691,SNAKE,The voice of my education said to me
2692,SNAKE,"He must be killed,"
2693,SNAKE,"For in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold are venomous."
2694,SNAKE,
2695,SNAKE,"And voices in me said, If you were a man"
2696,SNAKE,"You would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off."
2697,SNAKE,
2698,SNAKE,"But must I confess how I liked him,"
2699,SNAKE,"How glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink at my water-trough"
2700,SNAKE,"And depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,"
2701,SNAKE,Into the burning bowels of this earth?
2702,SNAKE,
2703,SNAKE,"Was it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?"
2704,SNAKE,"Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?"
2705,SNAKE,"Was it humility, to feel so honoured?"
2706,SNAKE,I felt so honoured.
2707,SNAKE,
2708,SNAKE,And yet those voices:
2709,SNAKE,"_If you were not afraid, you would kill him!_"
2710,SNAKE,
2711,SNAKE,"And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,"
2712,SNAKE,"But even so, honoured still more"
2713,SNAKE,That he should seek my hospitality
2714,SNAKE,From out the dark door of the secret earth.
2715,SNAKE,
2716,SNAKE,He drank enough
2717,SNAKE,"And lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,"
2718,SNAKE,"And dickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,"
2719,SNAKE,"Seeming to lick his lips,"
2720,SNAKE,"And looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,"
2721,SNAKE,"And slowly turned his head,"
2722,SNAKE,"And slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,"
2723,SNAKE,Proceeded to draw his slow length curving round
2724,SNAKE,And climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.
2725,SNAKE,
2726,SNAKE,"And as he put his head into that dreadful hole,"
2727,SNAKE,"And as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders, and entered farther,"
2728,SNAKE,"A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into that"
2729,SNAKE,"horrid black hole,"
2730,SNAKE,"Deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing himself after,"
2731,SNAKE,Overcame me now his back was turned.
2732,SNAKE,
2733,SNAKE,"I looked round, I put down my pitcher,"
2734,SNAKE,I picked up a clumsy log
2735,SNAKE,And threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.
2736,SNAKE,
2737,SNAKE,"I think it did not hit him,"
2738,SNAKE,But suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed in undignified
2739,SNAKE,"haste,"
2740,SNAKE,"Writhed like lightning, and was gone"
2741,SNAKE,"Into the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,"
2742,SNAKE,"At which, in the intense still noon, I stared with fascination."
2743,SNAKE,
2744,SNAKE,And immediately I regretted it.
2745,SNAKE,"I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!"
2746,SNAKE,I despised myself and the voices of my accursed human education.
2747,SNAKE,
2748,SNAKE,"And I thought of the albatross,"
2749,SNAKE,"And I wished he would come back, my snake."
2750,SNAKE,
2751,SNAKE,"For he seemed to me again like a king,"
2752,SNAKE,"Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,"
2753,SNAKE,Now due to be crowned again.
2754,SNAKE,
2755,SNAKE,"And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords"
2756,SNAKE,Of life.
2757,SNAKE,And I have something to expiate;
2758,SNAKE,A pettiness.

2774,BABY TORTOISE,
2775,BABY TORTOISE,"A tiny, fragile, half-animate bean."
2776,BABY TORTOISE,
2777,BABY TORTOISE,"To open your tiny beak-mouth, that looks as if it would never open,"
2778,BABY TORTOISE,Like some iron door;
2779,BABY TORTOISE,To lift the upper hawk-beak from the lower base
2780,BABY TORTOISE,And reach your skinny little neck
2781,BABY TORTOISE,"And take your first bite at some dim bit of herbage,"
2782,BABY TORTOISE,"Alone, small insect,"
2783,BABY TORTOISE,"Tiny bright-eye,"
2784,BABY TORTOISE,Slow one.
2785,BABY TORTOISE,
2786,BABY TORTOISE,To take your first solitary bite

2788,BABY TORTOISE,"Your bright, dark little eye,"
2789,BABY TORTOISE,"Your eye of a dark disturbed night,"
2790,BABY TORTOISE,"Under its slow lid, tiny baby tortoise,"
2791,BABY TORTOISE,So indomitable.
2792,BABY TORTOISE,
2793,BABY TORTOISE,No one ever heard you complain.
2794,BABY TORTOISE,
2795,BABY TORTOISE,"You draw your head forward, slowly, from your little wimple"
2796,BABY TORTOISE,"And set forward, slow-dragging, on your four-pinned toes,"
2797,BABY TORTOISE,Rowing slowly forward.
2798,BABY TORTOISE,"Whither away, small bird?"
2799,BABY TORTOISE,
2800,BABY TORTOISE,"Rather like a baby working its limbs,"
2801,BABY TORTOISE,"Except that you make slow, ageless progress"
2802,BABY TORTOISE,And a baby makes none.
2803,BABY TORTOISE,
2804,BABY TORTOISE,"The touch of sun excites you,"
2805,BABY TORTOISE,"And the long ages, and the lingering chill"
2806,BABY TORTOISE,"Make you pause to yawn,"
2807,BABY TORTOISE,"Opening your impervious mouth,"
2808,BABY TORTOISE,"Suddenly beak-shaped, and very wide, like some suddenly gaping pincers;"
2809,BABY TORTOISE,"Soft red tongue, and hard thin gums,"

2816,BABY TORTOISE,The non-life?
2817,BABY TORTOISE,
2818,BABY TORTOISE,You are so hard to wake.
2819,BABY TORTOISE,
2820,BABY TORTOISE,Are you able to wonder?
2821,BABY TORTOISE,Or is it just your indomitable will and pride of the first life
2822,BABY TORTOISE,Looking round
2823,BABY TORTOISE,And slowly pitching itself against the inertia
2824,BABY TORTOISE,Which had seemed invincible?
2825,BABY TORTOISE,
2826,BABY TORTOISE,"The vast inanimate,"
2827,BABY TORTOISE,"And the fine brilliance of your so tiny eye,"
2828,BABY TORTOISE,Challenger.
2829,BABY TORTOISE,
2830,BABY TORTOISE,"Nay, tiny shell-bird,"
2831,BABY TORTOISE,"What a huge vast inanimate it is, that you must row against,"

2856,BABY TORTOISE,Your little round house in the midst of chaos.

2918,TORTOISE SHELL,"And on either side count five,"
2919,TORTOISE SHELL,"On each side, two above, on each side, two below"
2920,TORTOISE SHELL,The dark bar horizontal.
2921,TORTOISE SHELL,
2922,TORTOISE SHELL,The Cross!
2923,TORTOISE SHELL,"It goes right through him, the sprottling insect,"
2924,TORTOISE SHELL,"Through his cross-wise cloven psyche,"
2925,TORTOISE SHELL,Through his five-fold complex-nature.
2926,TORTOISE SHELL,
2927,TORTOISE SHELL,So turn him over on his toes again;
2928,TORTOISE SHELL,"Four pin-point toes, and a problematical thumb-piece,"
2929,TORTOISE SHELL,"Four rowing limbs, and one wedge-balancing head,"
2930,TORTOISE SHELL,"Four and one makes five, which is the clue to all mathematics."
2931,TORTOISE SHELL,
2932,TORTOISE SHELL,The Lord wrote it all down on the little slate
2933,TORTOISE SHELL,Of the baby tortoise.
2934,TORTOISE SHELL,"Outward and visible indication of the plan within,"
2935,TORTOISE SHELL,"The complex, manifold involvedness of an individual creature"
2936,TORTOISE SHELL,Plotted out
2937,TORTOISE SHELL,"On this small bird, this rudiment,"
2938,TORTOISE SHELL,"This little dome, this pediment"
2939,TORTOISE SHELL,"Of all creation,"
2940,TORTOISE SHELL,This slow one.

2948,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"On he goes, the little one,"
2949,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Bud of the universe,"
2950,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Pediment of life.
2951,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
2952,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Setting off somewhere, apparently."
2953,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Whither away, brisk egg?"
2954,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
2955,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"His mother deposited him on the soil as if he were no more than droppings,"
2956,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,And now he scuffles tinily past her as if she were an old rusty tin.
2957,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
2958,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"A mere obstacle,"
2959,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,He veers round the slow great mound of her--
2960,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Tortoises always foresee obstacles.
2961,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
2962,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,It is no use my saying to him in an emotional voice:
2963,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"“This is your Mother, she laid you when you were an egg.”"
2964,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
2965,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"He does not even trouble to answer: “Woman, what have I to do with thee?”"
2966,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"He wearily looks the other way,"
2967,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"And she even more wearily looks another way still,"
2968,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Each with the utmost apathy,"
2969,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Incognisant,"
2970,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Unaware,"
2971,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Nothing.
2972,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
2973,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"As for papa,"
2974,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"He snaps when I offer him his offspring,"
2975,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Just as he snaps when I poke a bit of stick at him,"
2976,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Because he is irascible this morning, an irascible tortoise"
2977,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Being touched with love, and devoid of fatherliness."
2978,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
2979,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Father and mother,"
2980,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"And three little brothers,"
2981,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"And all rambling aimless, like little perambulating pebbles"
2982,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"scattered in the garden,"
2983,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Not knowing each other from bits of earth or old tins.
2984,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
2985,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Except that papa and mama are old acquaintances, of course,"
2986,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Though family feeling there is none, not even the beginnings."
2987,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
2988,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Fatherless, motherless, brotherless, sisterless"
2989,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Little tortoise.
2990,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
2991,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Row on then, small pebble,"
2992,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Over the clods of the autumn, wind-chilled sunshine,"
2993,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Young gaiety.
2994,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
2995,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Does he look for a companion?
2996,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
2997,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"No, no, don’t think it."
2998,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,He doesn’t know he is alone;
2999,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Isolation is his birthright,"
3000,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,This atom.
3001,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
3002,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"To row forward, and reach himself tall on spiny toes,"
3003,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"To travel, to burrow into a little loose earth, afraid of the night,"
3004,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"To crop a little substance,"
3005,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"To move, and to be quite sure that he is moving:"
3006,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Basta!
3007,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,To be a tortoise!
3008,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Think of it, in a garden of inert clods"
3009,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"A brisk, brindled little tortoise, all to himself--"
3010,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Crœsus!
3011,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
3012,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,In a garden of pebbles and insects
3013,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"To roam, and feel the slow heart beat"
3014,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Tortoise-wise, the first bell sounding"
3015,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"From the warm blood, in the dark-creation morning."
3016,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
3017,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Moving, and being himself,"
3018,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Slow, and unquestioned,"
3019,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"And inordinately there, O stoic!"
3020,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Wandering in the slow triumph of his own existence,"
3021,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Ringing the soundless bell of his presence in chaos,"
3022,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"And biting the frail grass arrogantly,"
3023,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Decidedly arrogantly.

3028,LUI ET ELLE,LUI ET ELLE
3029,LUI ET ELLE,
3030,LUI ET ELLE,
3031,LUI ET ELLE,She is large and matronly
3032,LUI ET ELLE,"And rather dirty,"
3033,LUI ET ELLE,"A little sardonic-looking, as if domesticity had driven her to it."
3034,LUI ET ELLE,
3035,LUI ET ELLE,"Though what she does, except lay four eggs at random in the garden once"
3036,LUI ET ELLE,a year
3037,LUI ET ELLE,"And put up with her husband,"
3038,LUI ET ELLE,I don’t know.
3039,LUI ET ELLE,
3040,LUI ET ELLE,She likes to eat.
3041,LUI ET ELLE,"She hurries up, striding reared on long uncanny legs,"
3042,LUI ET ELLE,When food is going.
3043,LUI ET ELLE,"Oh yes, she can make haste when she likes."
3044,LUI ET ELLE,
3045,LUI ET ELLE,"She snaps the soft bread from my hand in great mouthfuls,"
3046,LUI ET ELLE,"Opening her rather pretty wedge of an iron, pristine face"
3047,LUI ET ELLE,Into an enormously wide-beaked mouth
3048,LUI ET ELLE,"Like sudden curved scissors,"
3049,LUI ET ELLE,"And gulping at more than she can swallow, and working her thick, soft tongue,"
3050,LUI ET ELLE,And having the bread hanging over her chin.
3051,LUI ET ELLE,
3052,LUI ET ELLE,"O Mistress, Mistress,"
3053,LUI ET ELLE,"Reptile mistress,"
3054,LUI ET ELLE,"Your eye is very dark, very bright,"
3055,LUI ET ELLE,And it never softens
3056,LUI ET ELLE,Although you watch.
3057,LUI ET ELLE,
3058,LUI ET ELLE,"She knows,"
3059,LUI ET ELLE,"She knows well enough to come for food,"
3060,LUI ET ELLE,Yet she sees me not;
3061,LUI ET ELLE,"Her bright eye sees, but not me, not anything,"
3062,LUI ET ELLE,"Sightful, sightless, seeing and visionless,"
3063,LUI ET ELLE,Reptile mistress.
3064,LUI ET ELLE,
3065,LUI ET ELLE,"Taking bread in her curved, gaping, toothless mouth,"
3066,LUI ET ELLE,"She has no qualm when she catches my finger in her steel overlapping gums,"
3067,LUI ET ELLE,"But she hangs on, and my shout and my shrinking are nothing to her."
3068,LUI ET ELLE,She does not even know she is nipping me with her curved beak.
3069,LUI ET ELLE,"Snake-like she draws at my finger, while I drag it in horror away."
3070,LUI ET ELLE,
3071,LUI ET ELLE,"Mistress, reptile mistress,"
3072,LUI ET ELLE,"You are almost too large, I am almost frightened."
3073,LUI ET ELLE,
3074,LUI ET ELLE,"He is much smaller,"
3075,LUI ET ELLE,"Dapper beside her,"
3076,LUI ET ELLE,And ridiculously small.
3077,LUI ET ELLE,
3078,LUI ET ELLE,"Her laconic eye has an earthy, materialistic look,"
3079,LUI ET ELLE,"His, poor darling, is almost fiery."
3080,LUI ET ELLE,
3081,LUI ET ELLE,"His wimple, his blunt-prowed face,"
3082,LUI ET ELLE,"His low forehead, his skinny neck, his long, scaled, striving legs,"
3083,LUI ET ELLE,"So striving, striving,"
3084,LUI ET ELLE,"Are all more delicate than she,"
3085,LUI ET ELLE,And he has a cruel scar on his shell.
3086,LUI ET ELLE,
3087,LUI ET ELLE,"Poor darling, biting at her feet,"
3088,LUI ET ELLE,"Running beside her like a dog, biting her earthy, splay feet,"
3089,LUI ET ELLE,"Nipping her ankles,"
3090,LUI ET ELLE,"Which she drags apathetic away, though without retreating into her shell."
3091,LUI ET ELLE,
3092,LUI ET ELLE,"Agelessly silent,"
3093,LUI ET ELLE,"And with a grim, reptile determination,"
3094,LUI ET ELLE,"Cold, voiceless age-after-age behind him, serpents’ long obstinacy"
3095,LUI ET ELLE,Of horizontal persistence.
3096,LUI ET ELLE,
3097,LUI ET ELLE,Little old man
3098,LUI ET ELLE,"Scuffling beside her, bending down, catching his opportunity,"
3099,LUI ET ELLE,"Parting his steel-trap face, so suddenly, and seizing her scaly ankle,"
3100,LUI ET ELLE,"And hanging grimly on,"
3101,LUI ET ELLE,"Letting go at last as she drags away,"
3102,LUI ET ELLE,And closing his steel-trap face.
3103,LUI ET ELLE,
3104,LUI ET ELLE,"His steel-trap, stoic, ageless, handsome face."
3105,LUI ET ELLE,"Alas, what a fool he looks in this scuffle."
3106,LUI ET ELLE,
3107,LUI ET ELLE,And how he feels it!
3108,LUI ET ELLE,"The lonely rambler, the stoic, dignified stalker through chaos,"
3109,LUI ET ELLE,"The immune, the animate,"
3110,LUI ET ELLE,"Enveloped in isolation,"
3111,LUI ET ELLE,Forerunner.
3112,LUI ET ELLE,Now look at him!
3113,LUI ET ELLE,
3114,LUI ET ELLE,"Alas, the spear is through the side of his isolation."
3115,LUI ET ELLE,"His adolescence saw him crucified into sex,"
3116,LUI ET ELLE,"Doomed, in the long crucifixion of desire, to seek his consummation beyond"
3117,LUI ET ELLE,himself.
3118,LUI ET ELLE,"Divided into passionate duality,"
3119,LUI ET ELLE,"He, so finished and immune, now broken into desirous fragmentariness,"
3120,LUI ET ELLE,Doomed to make an intolerable fool of himself
3121,LUI ET ELLE,In his effort toward completion again.
3122,LUI ET ELLE,
3123,LUI ET ELLE,"Poor little earthy house-inhabiting Osiris,"
3124,LUI ET ELLE,"The mysterious bull tore him at adolescence into pieces,"
3125,LUI ET ELLE,"And he must struggle after reconstruction, ignominiously."
3126,LUI ET ELLE,
3127,LUI ET ELLE,And so behold him following the tail
3128,LUI ET ELLE,"Of that mud-hovel of his slowly rambling spouse,"
3129,LUI ET ELLE,"Like some unhappy bull at the tail of a cow,"
3130,LUI ET ELLE,"But with more than bovine, grim, earth-dank persistence."
3131,LUI ET ELLE,
3132,LUI ET ELLE,"Suddenly seizing the ugly ankle as she stretches out to walk,"
3133,LUI ET ELLE,"Roaming over the sods,"
3134,LUI ET ELLE,"Or, if it happen to show, at her pointed, heavy tail"
3135,LUI ET ELLE,Beneath the low-dropping back-board of her shell.
3136,LUI ET ELLE,
3137,LUI ET ELLE,"Their two shells like domed boats bumping,"
3138,LUI ET ELLE,"Hers huge, his small;"
3139,LUI ET ELLE,"Their splay feet rambling and rowing like paddles,"
3140,LUI ET ELLE,"And stumbling mixed up in one another,"
3141,LUI ET ELLE,In the race of love--
3142,LUI ET ELLE,"Two tortoises,"
3143,LUI ET ELLE,"She huge, he small."
3144,LUI ET ELLE,
3145,LUI ET ELLE,"She seems earthily apathetic,"
3146,LUI ET ELLE,And he has a reptile’s awful persistence.
3147,LUI ET ELLE,
3148,LUI ET ELLE,"I heard a woman pitying her, pitying the Mère Tortue."
3149,LUI ET ELLE,"While I, I pity Monsieur."
3150,LUI ET ELLE,"“He pesters her and torments her,” said the woman."
3151,LUI ET ELLE,"How much more is _he_ pestered and tormented, say I."
3152,LUI ET ELLE,
3153,LUI ET ELLE,What can he do?
3154,LUI ET ELLE,"He is dumb, he is visionless,"
3155,LUI ET ELLE,Conceptionless.
3156,LUI ET ELLE,"His black, sad-lidded eye sees but beholds not"
3157,LUI ET ELLE,"As her earthen mound moves on,"
3158,LUI ET ELLE,"But he catches the folds of vulnerable, leathery skin,"
3159,LUI ET ELLE,"Nail-studded, that shake beneath her shell,"
3160,LUI ET ELLE,"And drags at these with his beak,"
3161,LUI ET ELLE,"Drags and drags and bites,"
3162,LUI ET ELLE,"While she pulls herself free, and rows her dull mound along."

3168,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,
3169,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,
3170,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,Making his advances
3171,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"He does not look at her, nor sniff at her,"
3172,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"No, not even sniff at her, his nose is blank."
3173,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,
3174,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,Only he senses the vulnerable folds of skin
3175,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,That work beneath her while she sprawls along
3176,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"In her ungainly pace,"
3177,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,Her folds of skin that work and row
3178,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,Beneath the earth-soiled hovel in which she moves.
3179,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,
3180,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,And so he strains beneath her housey walls
3181,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,And catches her trouser-legs in his beak
3182,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Suddenly, or her skinny limb,"
3183,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,And strange and grimly drags at her
3184,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Like a dog,"
3185,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Only agelessly silent, with a reptile’s awful persistency"
3186,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,
3187,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Grim, gruesome gallantry, to which he is doomed."
3188,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,Dragged out of an eternity of silent isolation
3189,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"And doomed to partiality, partial being,"
3190,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Ache, and want of being,"
3191,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Want,"
3192,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Self-exposure, hard humiliation, need to add himself on to her"
3193,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,
3194,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Born to walk alone,"
3195,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Fore-runner,"
3196,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Now suddenly distracted into this mazy side-track,"
3197,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"This awkward, harrowing pursuit,"
3198,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,This grim necessity from within.
3199,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,
3200,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,Does she know
3201,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,As she moves eternally slowly away?
3202,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Or is he driven against her with a bang, like a bird flying in the dark"
3203,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"against a window,"
3204,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,All knowledgeless?
3205,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,
3206,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"The awful concussion,"
3207,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"And the still more awful need to persist, to follow, follow, continue,"
3208,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,
3209,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Driven, after æons of pristine, fore-god-like singleness and oneness,"
3210,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"At the end of some mysterious, red-hot iron,"
3211,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Driven away from himself into her tracks,"
3212,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,Forced to crash against her.
3213,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,
3214,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Stiff, gallant, irascible, crook-legged reptile,"
3215,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Little gentleman,"
3216,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Sorry plight,"
3217,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,We ought to look the other way.
3218,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,
3219,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Save that, having come with you so far,"

3229,TORTOISE SHOUT,"I said he was dumb,"
3230,TORTOISE SHOUT,Yet I’ve heard him cry.
3231,TORTOISE SHOUT,
3232,TORTOISE SHOUT,"First faint scream,"
3233,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Out of life’s unfathomable dawn,"
3234,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Far off, so far, like a madness, under the horizon’s dawning rim,"
3235,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Far, far off, far scream."

3238,TORTOISE SHOUT,
3239,TORTOISE SHOUT,Why were we crucified into sex?

3241,TORTOISE SHOUT,"As we began,"
3242,TORTOISE SHOUT,"As he certainly began, so perfectly alone?"
3243,TORTOISE SHOUT,
3244,TORTOISE SHOUT,"A far, was-it-audible scream,"
3245,TORTOISE SHOUT,Or did it sound on the plasm direct?
3246,TORTOISE SHOUT,
3247,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Worse than the cry of the new-born,"
3248,TORTOISE SHOUT,"A scream,"
3249,TORTOISE SHOUT,"A yell,"
3250,TORTOISE SHOUT,"A shout,"
3251,TORTOISE SHOUT,"A pæan,"
3252,TORTOISE SHOUT,"A death-agony,"
3253,TORTOISE SHOUT,"A birth-cry,"
3254,TORTOISE SHOUT,"A submission,"
3255,TORTOISE SHOUT,"All tiny, tiny, far away, reptile under the first dawn."
3256,TORTOISE SHOUT,"War-cry, triumph, acute delight, death-scream reptilian,"
3257,TORTOISE SHOUT,Why was the veil torn?
3258,TORTOISE SHOUT,The silken shriek of the soul’s torn membrane?
3259,TORTOISE SHOUT,The male soul’s membrane
3260,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Torn with a shriek half music, half horror."
3261,TORTOISE SHOUT,
3262,TORTOISE SHOUT,Crucifixion.
3263,TORTOISE SHOUT,
3264,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Male tortoise, cleaving behind the hovel-wall of that dense female,"
3265,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Mounted and tense, spread-eagle, out-reaching out of the shell"
3266,TORTOISE SHOUT,"In tortoise-nakedness,"
3267,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Long neck, and long vulnerable limbs extruded, spread-eagle over her house-roof,"
3268,TORTOISE SHOUT,"And the deep, secret, all-penetrating tail curved beneath her walls,"
3269,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Reaching and gripping tense, more reaching anguish in uttermost tension"
3270,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Till suddenly, in the spasm of coition, tupping like a"
3271,TORTOISE SHOUT,"jerking leap, and oh!"
3272,TORTOISE SHOUT,Opening its clenched face from his outstretched neck
3273,TORTOISE SHOUT,"And giving that fragile yell, that scream,"
3274,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Super-audible,"
3275,TORTOISE SHOUT,"From his pink, cleft, old-man’s mouth,"
3276,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Giving up the ghost,"
3277,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Or screaming in Pentecost, receiving the ghost."
3278,TORTOISE SHOUT,
3279,TORTOISE SHOUT,"His scream, and his moment’s subsidence,"
3280,TORTOISE SHOUT,"The moment of eternal silence,"
3281,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Yet unreleased, and after the moment, the sudden, startling"
3282,TORTOISE SHOUT,"jerk of coition, and at once"
3283,TORTOISE SHOUT,The inexpressible faint yell--
3284,TORTOISE SHOUT,"And so on, till the last plasm of my body was melted back"
3285,TORTOISE SHOUT,"To the primeval rudiments of life, and the secret."
3286,TORTOISE SHOUT,
3287,TORTOISE SHOUT,"So he tups, and screams"
3288,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Time after time that frail, torn scream"
3289,TORTOISE SHOUT,"After each jerk, the longish interval,"
3290,TORTOISE SHOUT,"The tortoise eternity,"
3291,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Age-long, reptilian persistence,"
3292,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Heart-throb, slow heart-throb, persistent for the next spasm."
3293,TORTOISE SHOUT,
3294,TORTOISE SHOUT,"I remember, when I was a boy,"
3295,TORTOISE SHOUT,"I heard the scream of a frog, which was caught with his foot in the mouth"
3296,TORTOISE SHOUT,of an up-starting snake;
3297,TORTOISE SHOUT,I remember when I first heard bull-frogs break into sound in the spring;
3298,TORTOISE SHOUT,I remember hearing a wild goose out of the throat of night
3299,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Cry loudly, beyond the lake of waters;"
3300,TORTOISE SHOUT,"I remember the first time, out of a bush in the darkness, a nightingale’s"
3301,TORTOISE SHOUT,piercing cries and gurgles startled the depths of my soul;
3302,TORTOISE SHOUT,I remember the scream of a rabbit as I went through a wood at midnight;
3303,TORTOISE SHOUT,"I remember the heifer in her heat, blorting and blorting through the hours,"
3304,TORTOISE SHOUT,persistent and irrepressible;
3305,TORTOISE SHOUT,"I remember my first terror hearing the howl of weird, amorous cats;"
3306,TORTOISE SHOUT,"I remember the scream of a terrified, injured horse, the sheet-lightning,"
3307,TORTOISE SHOUT,"And running away from the sound of a woman in labour, something like an"
3308,TORTOISE SHOUT,"owl whooing,"
3309,TORTOISE SHOUT,"And listening inwardly to the first bleat of a lamb,"
3310,TORTOISE SHOUT,"The first wail of an infant,"
3311,TORTOISE SHOUT,"And my mother singing to herself,"
3312,TORTOISE SHOUT,"And the first tenor singing of the passionate throat of a young collier,"
3313,TORTOISE SHOUT,"who has long since drunk himself to death,"
3314,TORTOISE SHOUT,The first elements of foreign speech
3315,TORTOISE SHOUT,On wild dark lips.
3316,TORTOISE SHOUT,
3317,TORTOISE SHOUT,"And more than all these,"
3318,TORTOISE SHOUT,"And less than all these,"
3319,TORTOISE SHOUT,"This last,"
3320,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Strange, faint coition yell"
3321,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Of the male tortoise at extremity,"
3322,TORTOISE SHOUT,Tiny from under the very edge of the farthest far-off horizon of life.
3323,TORTOISE SHOUT,
3324,TORTOISE SHOUT,"The cross,"
3325,TORTOISE SHOUT,"The wheel on which our silence first is broken,"
3326,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Sex, which breaks up our integrity, our single inviolability, our deep silence"
3327,TORTOISE SHOUT,Tearing a cry from us.
3328,TORTOISE SHOUT,
3329,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Sex, which breaks us into voice, sets us calling across the deeps, calling,"
3330,TORTOISE SHOUT,"calling for the complement,"
3331,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Singing, and calling, and singing again, being answered, having found."
3332,TORTOISE SHOUT,
3333,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Torn, to become whole again, after long seeking for what is lost,"

3347,TURKEY-COCK,
3348,TURKEY-COCK,
3349,TURKEY-COCK,"You ruffled black blossom,"
3350,TURKEY-COCK,You glossy dark wind.
3351,TURKEY-COCK,
3352,TURKEY-COCK,"Your sort of gorgeousness,"
3353,TURKEY-COCK,Dark and lustrous
3354,TURKEY-COCK,And skinny repulsive
3355,TURKEY-COCK,"And poppy-glossy,"
3356,TURKEY-COCK,Is the gorgeousness that evokes my most puzzled admiration.
3357,TURKEY-COCK,
3358,TURKEY-COCK,Your aboriginality
3359,TURKEY-COCK,"Deep, unexplained,"
3360,TURKEY-COCK,"Like a Red Indian darkly unfinished and aloof,"
3361,TURKEY-COCK,Seems like the black and glossy seeds of countless centuries.
3362,TURKEY-COCK,
3363,TURKEY-COCK,Your wattles are the colour of steel-slag which has been red-hot
3364,TURKEY-COCK,"And is going cold,"
3365,TURKEY-COCK,"Cooling to a powdery, pale-oxydised sky-blue."
3366,TURKEY-COCK,
3367,TURKEY-COCK,"Why do you have wattles, and a naked, wattled head?"
3368,TURKEY-COCK,Why do you arch your naked-set eye with a more-than-comprehensible arrogance?
3369,TURKEY-COCK,
3370,TURKEY-COCK,"The vulture is bald, so is the condor, obscenely,"
3371,TURKEY-COCK,But only you have thrown this amazing mantilla of oxydised sky-blue
3372,TURKEY-COCK,And hot red over you.
3373,TURKEY-COCK,
3374,TURKEY-COCK,"This queer dross shawl of blue and vermilion,"
3375,TURKEY-COCK,Whereas the peacock has a diadem.
3376,TURKEY-COCK,
3377,TURKEY-COCK,I wonder why.
3378,TURKEY-COCK,"Perhaps it is a sort of uncanny decoration, a veil of loose skin."
3379,TURKEY-COCK,"Perhaps it is your assertion, in all this ostentation, of raw contradictoriness."
3380,TURKEY-COCK,Your wattles drip down like a shawl to your breast
3381,TURKEY-COCK,"And the point of your mantilla drops across your nose, unpleasantly."
3382,TURKEY-COCK,
3383,TURKEY-COCK,Or perhaps it is something unfinished
3384,TURKEY-COCK,"A bit of slag still adhering, after your firing in the furnace of creation."
3385,TURKEY-COCK,
3386,TURKEY-COCK,Or perhaps there is something in your wattles of a bull’s dew-lap
3387,TURKEY-COCK,Which slips down like a pendulum to balance the throbbing mass of
3388,TURKEY-COCK,"a generous breast,"
3389,TURKEY-COCK,
3390,TURKEY-COCK,The over-drip of a great passion hanging in the balance.
3391,TURKEY-COCK,"Only yours would be a raw, unsmelted passion, that will not quite fuse from"
3392,TURKEY-COCK,the dross.
3393,TURKEY-COCK,
3394,TURKEY-COCK,"You contract yourself,"
3395,TURKEY-COCK,You arch yourself as an archer’s bow
3396,TURKEY-COCK,Which quivers indrawn as you clench your spine
3397,TURKEY-COCK,Until your veiled head almost touches backward
3398,TURKEY-COCK,To the root-rising of your erected tail.
3399,TURKEY-COCK,And one intense and backward-curving frisson
3400,TURKEY-COCK,Seizes you as you clench yourself together
3401,TURKEY-COCK,Like some fierce magnet bringing its poles together.
3402,TURKEY-COCK,"Burning, pale positive pole of your wattled head!"
3403,TURKEY-COCK,And from the darkness of that opposite one
3404,TURKEY-COCK,"The upstart of your round-barred, sun-round tail!"
3405,TURKEY-COCK,
3406,TURKEY-COCK,"Whilst between the two, along the tense arch of your back"
3407,TURKEY-COCK,"Blows the magnetic current in fierce blasts,"
3408,TURKEY-COCK,"Ruffling black, shining feathers like lifted mail,"
3409,TURKEY-COCK,"Shuddering storm wind, or a water rushing through."
3410,TURKEY-COCK,
3411,TURKEY-COCK,"Your brittle, super-sensual arrogance"
3412,TURKEY-COCK,Tosses the crape of red across your brow and down your breast
3413,TURKEY-COCK,As you draw yourself upon yourself in insistence.
3414,TURKEY-COCK,
3415,TURKEY-COCK,It is a declaration of such tension in will
3416,TURKEY-COCK,"As time has not dared to avouch, nor eternity been able to unbend"
3417,TURKEY-COCK,Do what it may.
3418,TURKEY-COCK,"A raw American will, that has never been tempered by life;"
3419,TURKEY-COCK,"You brittle, will-tense bird with a foolish eye."
3420,TURKEY-COCK,
3421,TURKEY-COCK,The peacock lifts his rods of bronze
3422,TURKEY-COCK,And struts blue-brilliant out of the far East.
3423,TURKEY-COCK,But watch a turkey prancing low on earth
3424,TURKEY-COCK,"Drumming his vaulted wings, as savages drum"
3425,TURKEY-COCK,"Their rhythms on long-drawn, hollow, sinister drums."
3426,TURKEY-COCK,"The ponderous, sombre sound of the great drum of Huichilobos"
3427,TURKEY-COCK,"In pyramid Mexico, during sacrifice."
3428,TURKEY-COCK,"Drum, and the turkey onrush"
3429,TURKEY-COCK,"Sudden, demonic dauntlessness, full abreast,"
3430,TURKEY-COCK,All the bronze gloss of all his myriad petals
3431,TURKEY-COCK,Each one apart and instant.
3432,TURKEY-COCK,Delicate frail crescent of the gentle outline of white
3433,TURKEY-COCK,At each feather-tip
3434,TURKEY-COCK,So delicate;
3435,TURKEY-COCK,Yet the bronze wind-well suddenly clashing
3436,TURKEY-COCK,And the eye over-weening into madness.
3437,TURKEY-COCK,
3438,TURKEY-COCK,"Turkey-cock, turkey-cock"
3439,TURKEY-COCK,Are you the bird of the next dawn?
3440,TURKEY-COCK,
3441,TURKEY-COCK,"Has the peacock had his day, does he call in vain, screecher, for the sun"
3442,TURKEY-COCK,to rise?
3443,TURKEY-COCK,"The eagle, the dove, and the barnyard rooster, do they call in vain, trying"
3444,TURKEY-COCK,to wake the morrow?
3445,TURKEY-COCK,"And do you await us, wattled father, Westward?"
3446,TURKEY-COCK,Will your yell do it?
3447,TURKEY-COCK,
3448,TURKEY-COCK,Take up the trail of the vanished American
3449,TURKEY-COCK,Where it disappeared at the foot of the crucifix.
3450,TURKEY-COCK,"Take up the primordial Indian obstinacy,"
3451,TURKEY-COCK,"The more than human, dense insistence of will,"
3452,TURKEY-COCK,"And disdain, and blankness, and onrush, and prise open the new day with"
3453,TURKEY-COCK,them?
3454,TURKEY-COCK,
3455,TURKEY-COCK,"The East a dead letter, and Europe moribund.... Is that so?"
3456,TURKEY-COCK,"And those sombre, dead, feather-lustrous Aztecs, Amerindians,"
3457,TURKEY-COCK,"In all the sinister splendour of their red blood sacrifices,"
3458,TURKEY-COCK,"Do they stand under the dawn, half-godly, half-demon, awaiting the cry of"
3459,TURKEY-COCK,the turkey-cock?
3460,TURKEY-COCK,
3461,TURKEY-COCK,"Or must you go through the fire once more, till you’re smelted pure,"

3598,THE BLUE JAY,From the pine-tree that towers and hisses like a pillar of shaggy cloud
3599,THE BLUE JAY,Immense above the cabin
3600,THE BLUE JAY,"Comes a strident laugh as we approach, this little black dog and I."
3601,THE BLUE JAY,So halts the little black bitch on four spread paws in the snow
3602,THE BLUE JAY,"And looks up inquiringly into the pillar of cloud,"
3603,THE BLUE JAY,With a tinge of misgiving.
3604,THE BLUE JAY,_Ca-a-a!_ comes the scrape of ridicule out of the tree.

3681,THE ASS,"Ah then, when he tore the wind with his teeth,"

3701,THE ASS,Hence Jesus rode him in the Triumphant Entry.

3706,THE ASS,half-insatiable desire and half-unquenchable humiliation.
3707,THE ASS,Hence the black cross on his shoulders.
3708,THE ASS,
3709,THE ASS,"The Arabs were only half right, though they hinted the whole;"
3710,THE ASS,Everlasting lament in everlasting desire.
3711,THE ASS,
3712,THE ASS,"See him standing with his head down, near the Porta Cappuccini,"
3713,THE ASS,"Asinello,"
3714,THE ASS,Somaro;
3715,THE ASS,"With the half-veiled, beautiful eyes, and the pensive face not asleep,"
3716,THE ASS,"Motionless, like a bit of rock."
3717,THE ASS,
3718,THE ASS,"Has he seen the Gorgon’s head, and turned to stone?"
3719,THE ASS,"Alas, Love did it."
3720,THE ASS,"Now he’s a jackass, a pack-ass, a donkey, somaro, burro, with a boss piling"
3721,THE ASS,loads on his back.
3722,THE ASS,Tied by the nose at the Porta Cappuccini.
3723,THE ASS,"And tied in a knot, inside, dead-licked between two desires:"
3724,THE ASS,To overleap like a male all mares as obstacles
3725,THE ASS,In a leap at the sun;
3726,THE ASS,And to leap in one last heart-bursting leap like a male at the
3727,THE ASS,"goal of a mare,"
3728,THE ASS,And there end.
3729,THE ASS,"Well, you can’t have it both roads."
3730,THE ASS,
3731,THE ASS,_Hee! Hee! Ehee! Ehow! Ehaw!! Oh! Oh! Oh-h-h!!_
3732,THE ASS,"The wave of agony bursts in the stone that he was,"
3733,THE ASS,"Bares his long ass’s teeth, flattens his long ass’s ears, straightens his"
3734,THE ASS,"donkey neck,"
3735,THE ASS,And howls his pandemonium on the indignant air.
3736,THE ASS,
3737,THE ASS,"Yes, it’s a quandary."
3738,THE ASS,"Jesus rode on him, the first burden on the first beast of burden."
3739,THE ASS,Love on a submissive ass.
3740,THE ASS,So the tale began.
3741,THE ASS,
3742,THE ASS,But the ass never forgets.
3743,THE ASS,
3744,THE ASS,"The horse, being nothing but a nag, will forget."
3745,THE ASS,"And men, being mostly geldings and knacker-boned hacks, have almost all"
3746,THE ASS,forgot.
3747,THE ASS,"But the ass is a primal creature, and never forgets."
3748,THE ASS,
3749,THE ASS,"The Steppes of Tartary,"
3750,THE ASS,And Jesus on a meek ass-colt: mares: Mary escaping to Egypt: Joseph’s cudgel.
3751,THE ASS,
3752,THE ASS,_Hee! Hee! Ehee! Ehow-ow-!-ow!-aw!-aw!-aw!_
3753,THE ASS,_All mares are dead!_
3754,THE ASS,_Or else I am dead!_
3755,THE ASS,"_One of us, or the pair of us,_"
3756,THE ASS,_I don’t know--ow!--ow!_
3757,THE ASS,_Which!_
3758,THE ASS,_Not sure--ure--ure_
3759,THE ASS,_Quite which!_

3768,HE-GOAT,
3769,HE-GOAT,"See his black nose snubbed back, pressed over like a whale’s blow-holes,"
3770,HE-GOAT,As if his nostrils were going to curve back to the root of his tail.
3771,HE-GOAT,
3772,HE-GOAT,As he charges slow among the herd
3773,HE-GOAT,"And rows among the females like a ship pertinaciously,"
3774,HE-GOAT,"Heavy with a rancid cargo, through the lesser ships--"
3775,HE-GOAT,Old father
3776,HE-GOAT,"Sniffing forever ahead of him, at the rear of the goats, that they lift"
3777,HE-GOAT,"the little door,"
3778,HE-GOAT,"And rowing on, unarrived, no matter how often he enter:"
3779,HE-GOAT,Like a big ship pushing her bowsprit over the little ships
3780,HE-GOAT,Then swerving and steering afresh
3781,HE-GOAT,"And never, never arriving at journey’s end, at the rear of the female ships."
3782,HE-GOAT,
3783,HE-GOAT,Yellow eyes incomprehensible with thin slits
3784,HE-GOAT,To round-eyed us.
3785,HE-GOAT,
3786,HE-GOAT,Yet if you had whorled horns of bronze in a frontal dark wall
3787,HE-GOAT,"At the end of a back-bone ridge, like a straight sierra roquena,"
3788,HE-GOAT,"And nerves urging forward to the wall, you’d have eyes like his,"
3789,HE-GOAT,"Especially if, being given a needle’s eye of egress elsewhere"
3790,HE-GOAT,"You tried to look back to it, and couldn’t."
3791,HE-GOAT,"Sometimes he turns with a start, to fight, to challenge, to suddenly butt."
3792,HE-GOAT,"And then you see the God that he is, in a cloud of black hair"
3793,HE-GOAT,And storm-lightning-slitted eye.
3794,HE-GOAT,"Splendidly planting his feet, one rocky foot striking the ground with a"
3795,HE-GOAT,sudden rock-hammer announcement.
3796,HE-GOAT,
3797,HE-GOAT,_I am here!_
3798,HE-GOAT,"And suddenly lowering his head, the whorls of bone and of horn"
3799,HE-GOAT,"Slowly revolving towards unexploded explosion,"
3800,HE-GOAT,"As from the stem of his bristling, lightning-conductor tail"
3801,HE-GOAT,In a rush up the shrieking duct of his vertebral way
3802,HE-GOAT,Runs a rage drawn in from the other divinely through him
3803,HE-GOAT,Towards a shock and a crash and a smiting of horns ahead.
3804,HE-GOAT,
3805,HE-GOAT,"That is a grand old lust of his, to gather the great"
3806,HE-GOAT,Rage of the sullen-stagnating atmosphere of goats
3807,HE-GOAT,"And bring it hurtling to a head, with crash of horns against the horns"
3808,HE-GOAT,"Of the opposite enemy goat,"
3809,HE-GOAT,"Thus hammering the mettle of goats into proof, and smiting out"
3810,HE-GOAT,The godhead of goats from the shock.
3811,HE-GOAT,"Things of iron are beaten on the anvil,"
3812,HE-GOAT,"And he-goat is anvil to he-goat, and hammer to he-goat"
3813,HE-GOAT,In the business of beating the mettle of goats to a godhead.
3814,HE-GOAT,
3815,HE-GOAT,But they’ve taken his enemy from him
3816,HE-GOAT,"And left him only his libidinousness,"
3817,HE-GOAT,"His nostrils turning back, to sniff at even himself"
3818,HE-GOAT,"And his slitted eyes seeking the needle’s eye,"
3819,HE-GOAT,"His own, unthreaded, forever."
3820,HE-GOAT,
3821,HE-GOAT,"So it is, when they take the enemy from us,"
3822,HE-GOAT,And we can’t fight.
3823,HE-GOAT,
3824,HE-GOAT,"He is not fatherly, like the bull, massive Providence of hot blood;"
3825,HE-GOAT,"The goat is an egoist, aware of himself, devilish aware of himself,"
3826,HE-GOAT,"And full of malice prepense, and overweening, determined to stand"
3827,HE-GOAT,on the highest peak
3828,HE-GOAT,"Like the devil, and look on the world as his own."
3829,HE-GOAT,
3830,HE-GOAT,And as for love:
3831,HE-GOAT,With a needle of long red flint he stabs in the dark
3832,HE-GOAT,At the living rock he is up against;
3833,HE-GOAT,"While she with her goaty mouth stands smiling the while as he strikes, since sure"
3834,HE-GOAT,"He will never _quite_ strike home, on the target-quick, for her quick"
3835,HE-GOAT,Is just beyond range of the arrow he shoots
3836,HE-GOAT,"From his leap at the zenith in her, so it falls just short of the mark,"
3837,HE-GOAT,far enough.
3838,HE-GOAT,It is over before it is finished.
3839,HE-GOAT,"She, smiling with goaty munch-mouth, Mona Lisa, arranges it so."
3840,HE-GOAT,Orgasm after orgasm after orgasm
3841,HE-GOAT,"And he smells so rank and his nose goes back,"
3842,HE-GOAT,And never an enemy brow-metalled to thresh it out with in the open field;
3843,HE-GOAT,"Never a mountain peak, to be king of the castle."
3844,HE-GOAT,"Only those eternal females to overleap and surpass, and never succeed."
3845,HE-GOAT,
3846,HE-GOAT,The involved voluptuousness of the soft-footed cat
3847,HE-GOAT,"Who is like a fur folding a fur,"
3848,HE-GOAT,"The cat who laps blood, and knows"
3849,HE-GOAT,The soft welling of blood invincible even beyond bone or metal of bone.
3850,HE-GOAT,
3851,HE-GOAT,"The soft, the secret, the unfathomable blood"
3852,HE-GOAT,The cat has lapped
3853,HE-GOAT,"And known it subtler than frisson-shaken nerves,"
3854,HE-GOAT,Stronger than multiplicity of bone on bone
3855,HE-GOAT,And darker than even the arrows of violentest will
3856,HE-GOAT,"Can pierce, for that is where will gives out, like a sinking stone that"
3857,HE-GOAT,can sink no further.
3858,HE-GOAT,
3859,HE-GOAT,"But he-goat,"
3860,HE-GOAT,"Black procreant male of the selfish will and libidinous desire,"
3861,HE-GOAT,"God in black cloud with curving horns of bronze,"
3862,HE-GOAT,"Find an enemy, Egoist, and clash the cymbals in face-to-face defiance,"
3863,HE-GOAT,And let the lightning out of your smothered dusk.
3864,HE-GOAT,
3865,HE-GOAT,"Forget the female herd for a bit,"
3866,HE-GOAT,And fight to be boss of the world.
3867,HE-GOAT,"Fight, old Satan with a selfish will, fight for your selfish will;"
3868,HE-GOAT,Fight to be the devil on the tip of the peak
3869,HE-GOAT,Overlooking the world for his own.
3870,HE-GOAT,
3871,HE-GOAT,"But bah, how can he, poor domesticated beast!"

3882,SHE-GOAT,
3883,SHE-GOAT,"At dusk they patter back like a bough being dragged on the ground,"
3884,SHE-GOAT,"Raising dusk and acridity of goats, and bleating."
3885,SHE-GOAT,
3886,SHE-GOAT,Our old goat we tie up at night in the shed at the back of the broken Greek
3887,SHE-GOAT,"tomb in the garden,"
3888,SHE-GOAT,And when the herd goes by at dawn she begins to bleat for me to come down
3889,SHE-GOAT,and untie her.
3890,SHE-GOAT,
3891,SHE-GOAT,_Merr--err--err! Merr--er--errr! Mer! Mé!_
3892,SHE-GOAT,"_Wait, wait a bit, I’ll come when I’ve lit the fire._"

3896,SHE-GOAT,"_Tace, tu, crapa, bestia!_"
3897,SHE-GOAT,_Merr-ererrr-ererrrr! Merrrr!_
3898,SHE-GOAT,
3899,SHE-GOAT,"She is such an alert listener, with her ears wide, to know am I coming!"
3900,SHE-GOAT,"Such a canny listener, from a distance, looking upwards, lending first one"
3901,SHE-GOAT,"ear, then another."
3902,SHE-GOAT,
3903,SHE-GOAT,"There she is, perched on her manger, looking over the boards into the day"
3904,SHE-GOAT,Like a belle at her window.
3905,SHE-GOAT,
3906,SHE-GOAT,"And immediately she sees me she blinks, stares, doesn’t know me, turns her"
3907,SHE-GOAT,head and ignores me vulgarly with a wooden blank on her face.
3908,SHE-GOAT,
3909,SHE-GOAT,"What do I care for her, the ugly female, standing up there with her"
3910,SHE-GOAT,long tangled sides like an old rug thrown over a fence.
3911,SHE-GOAT,"But she puts her nose down shrewdly enough when the knot is untied,"
3912,SHE-GOAT,"And jumps staccato to earth, a sharp, dry jump, still ignoring me,"
3913,SHE-GOAT,Pretending to look round the stall.
3914,SHE-GOAT,
3915,SHE-GOAT,"_Come on, you, crapa! I’m not your servant!_"
3916,SHE-GOAT,
3917,SHE-GOAT,"She turns her head away with an obtuse, female sort of deafness, bête."
3918,SHE-GOAT,And then invariably she crouches her rear and makes water.
3919,SHE-GOAT,"That being her way of answer, if I speak to her.--Self-conscious!"
3920,SHE-GOAT,"_Le bestie non parlano, poverine!_"
3921,SHE-GOAT,
3922,SHE-GOAT,"She was bought at Giardini fair, on the sands, for six hundred lire."
3923,SHE-GOAT,
3924,SHE-GOAT,"An obstinate old witch, almost jerking the rope from my hands to eat"
3925,SHE-GOAT,"the acanthus, or bite at the almond buds, and make me wait."
3926,SHE-GOAT,Yet the moment I hate her she trips mild and smug like a woman going to
3927,SHE-GOAT,mass.
3928,SHE-GOAT,The moment I really detest her.
3929,SHE-GOAT,
3930,SHE-GOAT,"Queer it is, suddenly, in the garden"
3931,SHE-GOAT,"To catch sight of her standing like some huge, ghoulish grey bird in"
3932,SHE-GOAT,"the air, on the bough of the leaning almond-tree,"
3933,SHE-GOAT,"Straight as a board on the bough, looking down like some hairy horrid God"
3934,SHE-GOAT,the Father in a William Blake imagination.
3935,SHE-GOAT,"_Come down, crapa, out of that almond tree!_"
3936,SHE-GOAT,
3937,SHE-GOAT,"Instead of which she strangely rears on her perch in the air, vast beast,"
3938,SHE-GOAT,"And strangely paws the air, delicate,"
3939,SHE-GOAT,"And reaches her black-striped face up like a snake, far up,"
3940,SHE-GOAT,"Subtly, to the twigs overhead, far up, vast beast,"
3941,SHE-GOAT,"And snaps them sharp, with a little twist of her anaconda head;"
3942,SHE-GOAT,All her great hairy-shaggy belly open against the morning.
3943,SHE-GOAT,
3944,SHE-GOAT,"At seasons she curls back her tail like a green leaf in the fire,"
3945,SHE-GOAT,"Or like a lifted hand, hailing at her wrong end."
3946,SHE-GOAT,"And having exposed the pink place of her nakedness, fixedly,"
3947,SHE-GOAT,"She trots on blithe toes,"
3948,SHE-GOAT,"And if you look at her, she looks back with a cold, sardonic stare."
3949,SHE-GOAT,"Sardonic, sardonyx, rock of cold fire."
3950,SHE-GOAT,"_See me?_ She says, _That’s me!_"
3951,SHE-GOAT,
3952,SHE-GOAT,That’s her.
3953,SHE-GOAT,
3954,SHE-GOAT,"Then she leaps the rocks like a quick rock,"
3955,SHE-GOAT,"Her back-bone sharp as a rock,"
3956,SHE-GOAT,Sheer will.
3957,SHE-GOAT,
3958,SHE-GOAT,Along which ridge of libidinous magnetism
3959,SHE-GOAT,"Defiant, curling the leaf of her tail as if she were curling her lip behind"
3960,SHE-GOAT,"her at all life,"
3961,SHE-GOAT,"Libidinous desire runs back and forth, asserting itself in that little lifted bare hand."
3962,SHE-GOAT,
3963,SHE-GOAT,"Yet she has such adorable spurty kids, like spurts of black ink."
3964,SHE-GOAT,And in a month again is as if she had never had them.
3965,SHE-GOAT,
3966,SHE-GOAT,And when the billy goat mounts her
3967,SHE-GOAT,She is brittle as brimstone.
3968,SHE-GOAT,While his slitted eyes squint back to the roots of his ears.

3980,ELEPHANT,Through the palm-trees and past hollow paddy-fields where naked men are

3982,ELEPHANT,"And the monolithic water-buffaloes, like old, muddy stones with hair on"

3994,ELEPHANT,The slow beast curiously spreading his round feet for the dust.
3995,ELEPHANT,"And the slim naked man slips down, and the beast deposits the lump of wood,"
3996,ELEPHANT,carefully.
3997,ELEPHANT,"The keeper hooks the vast knee, the creature salaams."

4008,ELEPHANT,"night, of blazing cocoa-nut,"
4009,ELEPHANT,"Naked dark men beneath,"
4010,ELEPHANT,And the huge frontal of three great elephants stepping forth to the

4012,ELEPHANT,"Slowly sailing in gorgeous apparel through the flame-light, in front of"

4019,ELEPHANT,In the noise of the tom-toms and singers;
4020,ELEPHANT,"Elephants after elephants curl their trunks, vast shadows, and some cry"
4021,ELEPHANT,out
4022,ELEPHANT,"As they approach and salaam, under the dripping fire of the torches"
4023,ELEPHANT,"That pale fragment of a Prince up there, whose motto is _Ich dien_."
4024,ELEPHANT,
4025,ELEPHANT,"Pale, dispirited Prince, with his chin on his hands, his nerves tired out,"
4026,ELEPHANT,"Watching and hardly seeing the trunk-curl approach and clumsy, knee-lifting"
4027,ELEPHANT,salaam
4028,ELEPHANT,"Of the hugest, oldest of beasts in the night and the fire-flare below."
4029,ELEPHANT,"He is royalty, pale and dejected fragment up aloft."
4030,ELEPHANT,And down below huge homage of shadowy beasts; barefoot and trunk-lipped
4031,ELEPHANT,in the night.
4032,ELEPHANT,
4033,ELEPHANT,"Chieftains, three of them abreast, on foot"

4046,ELEPHANT,feet of elephants and men on the path in the dark.
4047,ELEPHANT,"And devil dancers luminous with sweat, dancing on to the shudder of drums,"

4059,ELEPHANT,"And lustrous great tropical eyes unveiled now, gleaming a kind of laugh,"
4060,ELEPHANT,"A naked, gleaming dark laugh, like a secret out in the dark,"
4061,ELEPHANT,"And flare of a tropical energy, tireless, afire in the dark, slim limbs"

4068,ELEPHANT,To the Prince
4069,ELEPHANT,To that tired remnant of royalty up there
4070,ELEPHANT,Whose motto is _Ich dien_.
4071,ELEPHANT,
4072,ELEPHANT,As if the homage of the kindled blood of the east
4073,ELEPHANT,"Went up in wavelets to him, from the breasts and eyes of jungle torch-men,"
4074,ELEPHANT,And he couldn’t take it.
4075,ELEPHANT,
4076,ELEPHANT,"What would they do, those jungle men running with sweat, with the strange"
4077,ELEPHANT,"dark laugh in their eyes, glancing up,"
4078,ELEPHANT,"And the sparse-haired elephants slowly following,"
4079,ELEPHANT,If they knew that his motto was _Ich dien_?
4080,ELEPHANT,And that he meant it.
4081,ELEPHANT,
4082,ELEPHANT,They begin to understand
4083,ELEPHANT,The rickshaw boys begin to understand
4084,ELEPHANT,"And then the devil comes into their faces,"
4085,ELEPHANT,"But a different sort, a cold, rebellious, jeering devil."
4086,ELEPHANT,
4087,ELEPHANT,"In elephants and the east are two devils, in all men maybe."
4088,ELEPHANT,"The mystery of the dark mountain of blood, reeking in homage, in lust, in"

4090,ELEPHANT,"And passive with everlasting patience,"
4091,ELEPHANT,"Then the little, cunning pig-devil of the elephant’s lurking eyes, the unbeliever."
4092,ELEPHANT,
4093,ELEPHANT,"We dodged, when the Pera-hera was finished, under the hanging, hairy"
4094,ELEPHANT,pigs’ tails
4095,ELEPHANT,"And the flat, flaccid mountains of the elephants’ standing haunches,"
4096,ELEPHANT,"Vast-blooded beasts,"
4097,ELEPHANT,Myself so little dodging rather scared against the eternal wrinkled pillars
4098,ELEPHANT,"of their legs, as they were being dismantled;"
4099,ELEPHANT,"Then I knew they were dejected, having come to hear the repeated"

4105,ELEPHANT,_Ich dien._
4106,ELEPHANT,
4107,ELEPHANT,That’s why the night fell in frustration.
4108,ELEPHANT,"That’s why, as the elephants ponderously, with unseeming swiftness, galloped"
4109,ELEPHANT,"uphill in the night, going back to the jungle villages,"
4110,ELEPHANT,"As the elephant bells sounded tong-tong-tong, bell of the temple of blood"
4111,ELEPHANT,"in the night, swift-striking,"
4112,ELEPHANT,And the crowd like a field of rice in the dark gave way like liquid to the
4113,ELEPHANT,dark
4114,ELEPHANT,"Looming gallop of the beasts,"
4115,ELEPHANT,It was as if the great bare bulks of elephants in the obscure light went
4116,ELEPHANT,"over the hill-brow swiftly, with their tails between their legs,"
4117,ELEPHANT,"in haste to get away,"
4118,ELEPHANT,Their bells sounding frustrate and sinister.
4119,ELEPHANT,
4120,ELEPHANT,"And all the dark-faced, cotton-wrapped people, more numerous and whispering"
4121,ELEPHANT,"than grains of rice in a ricefield at night,"
4122,ELEPHANT,"All the dark-faced, cotton-wrapped people, a countless host on the shores"
4123,ELEPHANT,"of the lake, like thick wild rice by the water’s edge,"
4124,ELEPHANT,"Waiting for the fireworks of the after-show,"
4125,ELEPHANT,"As the rockets went up, and the glare passed over countless faces, dark"
4126,ELEPHANT,"as black rice growing,"
4127,ELEPHANT,"Showing a glint of teeth, and glancing tropical eyes aroused in the night,"
4128,ELEPHANT,"There was the faintest twist of mockery in every face, across the hiss of"
4129,ELEPHANT,wonders as the rocket burst
4130,ELEPHANT,"High, high up, in flakes, shimmering flakes of blue fire, above the palm-trees"
4131,ELEPHANT,"of the islet in the lake,"
4132,ELEPHANT,"O faces upturned to the glare, O tropical wonder, wonder, a miracle in heaven!"
4133,ELEPHANT,"And the shadow of a jeer, of underneath disappointment, as the rocket-coruscation"
4134,ELEPHANT,"died, and shadow was the same as before."
4135,ELEPHANT,
4136,ELEPHANT,"They were foiled, the myriad whispering dark-faced cotton-wrapped people."
4137,ELEPHANT,"They had come to see royalty,"
4138,ELEPHANT,"To bow before royalty, in the land of elephants, bow deep, bow deep."
4139,ELEPHANT,"Bow deep, for it’s good as a draught of cool water to bow very, very low to"
4140,ELEPHANT,the royal.
4141,ELEPHANT,
4142,ELEPHANT,"And all there was to bow to, a weary, diffident boy whose motto is _Ich"

4176,KANGAROO,"As foxes, stoats, and wolves, and prairie dogs."
4177,KANGAROO,
4178,KANGAROO,"Only mice, and moles, and rats, and badgers, and beavers, and perhaps bears"
4179,KANGAROO,Seem belly-plumbed to the earth’s mid-navel.
4180,KANGAROO,"Or frogs that when they leap come flop, and flop to the centre of the earth."
4181,KANGAROO,
4182,KANGAROO,"But the yellow antipodal Kangaroo, when she sits up,"

4188,KANGAROO,
4189,KANGAROO,Delicate mother Kangaroo
4190,KANGAROO,"Sitting up there rabbit-wise, but huge, plumb-weighted,"

4195,KANGAROO,
4196,KANGAROO,"Her sensitive, long, pure-bred face."
4197,KANGAROO,"Her full antipodal eyes, so dark,"
4198,KANGAROO,"So big and quiet and remote, having watched so many empty dawns in silent"
4199,KANGAROO,Australia.
4200,KANGAROO,
4201,KANGAROO,"Her little loose hands, and drooping Victorian shoulders."
4202,KANGAROO,"And then her great weight below the waist, her vast pale belly"
4203,KANGAROO,"With a thin young yellow little paw hanging out, and straggle of a long"
4204,KANGAROO,"thin ear, like ribbon,"
4205,KANGAROO,"Like a funny trimming to the middle of her belly, thin little dangle of"
4206,KANGAROO,"an immature paw, and one thin ear."
4207,KANGAROO,
4208,KANGAROO,"Her belly, her big haunches"
4209,KANGAROO,"And in addition, the great muscular python-stretch of her tail."
4210,KANGAROO,
4211,KANGAROO,"There, she shan’t have any more peppermint drops."
4212,KANGAROO,"So she wistfully, sensitively sniffs the air, and then turns, goes off in"
4213,KANGAROO,slow sad leaps
4214,KANGAROO,
4215,KANGAROO,"On the long flat skis of her legs,"
4216,KANGAROO,Steered and propelled by that steel-strong snake of a tail.
4217,KANGAROO,
4218,KANGAROO,"Stops again, half turns, inquisitive to look back."
4219,KANGAROO,"While something stirs quickly in her belly, and a lean little face comes"
4220,KANGAROO,"out, as from a window,"
4221,KANGAROO,"Peaked and a bit dismayed,"
4222,KANGAROO,"Only to disappear again quickly away from the sight of the world, to"
4223,KANGAROO,"snuggle down in the warmth,"
4224,KANGAROO,Leaving the trail of a different paw hanging out.
4225,KANGAROO,
4226,KANGAROO,"Still she watches with eternal, cocked wistfulness!"
4227,KANGAROO,"How full her eyes are, like the full, fathomless, shining eyes of an"

4229,KANGAROO,Who has been lost so many centuries on the margins of existence!

4232,KANGAROO,"Untold centuries of watching for something to come,"
4233,KANGAROO,"For a new signal from life, in that silent lost land of the South."
4234,KANGAROO,
4235,KANGAROO,"Where nothing bites but insects and snakes and the sun, small life."
4236,KANGAROO,"Where no bull roared, no cow ever lowed, no stag cried, no leopard"
4237,KANGAROO,"screeched, no lion coughed, no dog barked,"
4238,KANGAROO,"But all was silent save for parrots occasionally, in the haunted blue bush."
4239,KANGAROO,
4240,KANGAROO,"Wistfully watching, with wonderful liquid eyes."
4241,KANGAROO,"And all her weight, all her blood, dripping sack-wise down towards the"

4243,KANGAROO,And the live little one taking in its paw at the door of her belly.

4410,BIBBLES,loved all along.
4411,BIBBLES,And they’re taken in.

4413,BIBBLES,
4414,BIBBLES,Fidelity! Loyalty! Attachment!
4415,BIBBLES,"Oh, these are abstractions to your nasty little belly."
4416,BIBBLES,You must always be a-waggle with LOVE.
4417,BIBBLES,Such a waggle of love you can hardly distinguish one human from another.
4418,BIBBLES,"You love one after another, on one condition, that each one loves you most."
4419,BIBBLES,"Democratic little bull-bitch, dirt-eating little swine."
4420,BIBBLES,

4425,BIBBLES,You don’t love ’em now.
4426,BIBBLES,"They want something of you, so you squeak and come pelting indoors."
4427,BIBBLES,
4428,BIBBLES,"Come pelting to me, now the other folk have found you out, and the dogs"
4429,BIBBLES,are after you.
4430,BIBBLES,"Oh yes, you’re found out. I heard them kick you out of the ranch house."
4431,BIBBLES,"_Get out, you little, soft fool!!_"
4432,BIBBLES,
4433,BIBBLES,And didn’t you turn your eyes up at me then?
4434,BIBBLES,And didn’t you cringe on the floor like any inkspot!
4435,BIBBLES,And crawl away like a black snail!
4436,BIBBLES,And doesn’t everybody loathe you then!
4437,BIBBLES,"And aren’t your feelings violated, you high-bred little love-bitch!"
4438,BIBBLES,
4439,BIBBLES,"For you’re sensitive,"
4440,BIBBLES,In many ways very finely bred.
4441,BIBBLES,But bred in conceit that the world is all for love
4442,BIBBLES,"Of you, my bitch: till you get so far you eat filth."

4444,BIBBLES,wrinkled old aunty’s face.
4445,BIBBLES,
4446,BIBBLES,"So now, what with great Airedale dogs,"
4447,BIBBLES,"And a kick or two,"
4448,BIBBLES,"And a few vomiting bouts,"
4449,BIBBLES,"And a juniper switch,"
4450,BIBBLES,"You look at me for discrimination, don’t you?"
4451,BIBBLES,"Look up at me with misgiving in your bulging eyes,"
4452,BIBBLES,"And fear in the smoky whites of your eyes, you nigger;"
4453,BIBBLES,"And you’re puzzled,"
4454,BIBBLES,"You think you’d better mind your P’s and Q’s for a bit,"

4494,MOUNTAIN LION,"He smiles, foolishly, as if he were caught doing wrong."
4495,MOUNTAIN LION,"And we smile, foolishly, as if we didn’t know."
4496,MOUNTAIN LION,He is quite gentle and dark-faced.
4497,MOUNTAIN LION,
4498,MOUNTAIN LION,"It is a mountain lion,"
4499,MOUNTAIN LION,"A long, long slim cat, yellow like a lioness."
4500,MOUNTAIN LION,Dead.
4501,MOUNTAIN LION,
4502,MOUNTAIN LION,"He trapped her this morning, he says, smiling foolishly."
4503,MOUNTAIN LION,
4504,MOUNTAIN LION,"Lift up her face,"
4505,MOUNTAIN LION,"Her round, bright face, bright as frost."
4506,MOUNTAIN LION,"Her round, fine-fashioned head, with two dead ears;"
4507,MOUNTAIN LION,"And stripes in the brilliant frost of her face, sharp, fine dark rays,"
4508,MOUNTAIN LION,"Dark, keen, fine rays in the brilliant frost of her face."
4509,MOUNTAIN LION,Beautiful dead eyes.
4510,MOUNTAIN LION,
4511,MOUNTAIN LION,_Hermoso es!_
4512,MOUNTAIN LION,
4513,MOUNTAIN LION,They go out towards the open;
4514,MOUNTAIN LION,We go on into the gloom of Lobo.
4515,MOUNTAIN LION,"And above the trees I found her lair,"
4516,MOUNTAIN LION,"A hole in the blood-orange brilliant rocks that stick up, a little cave."
4517,MOUNTAIN LION,"And bones, and twigs, and a perilous ascent."
4518,MOUNTAIN LION,
4519,MOUNTAIN LION,"So, she will never leap up that way again, with the yellow"
4520,MOUNTAIN LION,flash of a mountain lion’s long shoot!
4521,MOUNTAIN LION,"And her bright striped frost face will never watch any more, out of the"
4522,MOUNTAIN LION,"shadow of the cave in the blood-orange rock,"
4523,MOUNTAIN LION,Above the trees of the Lobo dark valley-mouth!
4524,MOUNTAIN LION,
4525,MOUNTAIN LION,"Instead, I look out."
4526,MOUNTAIN LION,"And out to the dim of the desert, like a dream, never real;"
4527,MOUNTAIN LION,"To the snow of the Sangre de Cristo mountains, the ice of the mountains"
4528,MOUNTAIN LION,"of Picoris,"
4529,MOUNTAIN LION,"And near across at the opposite steep of snow, green trees motionless"
4530,MOUNTAIN LION,"standing in snow, like a Christmas toy."
4531,MOUNTAIN LION,
4532,MOUNTAIN LION,And I think in this empty world there was room for me and a mountain lion
4533,MOUNTAIN LION,"And I think in the world beyond, how easily we might spare a million or"
4534,MOUNTAIN LION,two of humans
4535,MOUNTAIN LION,And never miss them.
4536,MOUNTAIN LION,"Yet what a gap in the world, the missing white frost face of that"
4537,MOUNTAIN LION,slim yellow mountain lion!

4544,THE RED WOLF,
4545,THE RED WOLF,
4546,THE RED WOLF,"Over the heart of the west, the Taos desert"
4547,THE RED WOLF,"Circles an eagle,"
4548,THE RED WOLF,And it’s dark between me and him.
4549,THE RED WOLF,
4550,THE RED WOLF,"The sun, as he waits a moment, huge and liquid"
4551,THE RED WOLF,Standing without feet on the rim of the far-off mesa
4552,THE RED WOLF,Says: _Look for a last long time then! Look! Look well! I am going._
4553,THE RED WOLF,"So he pauses and is beholden, and straightway is gone."
4554,THE RED WOLF,
4555,THE RED WOLF,"And the Indian, in a white sheet"
4556,THE RED WOLF,"Wrapped to the eyes, the sheet bound close on his brows,"
4557,THE RED WOLF,"Stands saying: _See, I’m invisible!_"
4558,THE RED WOLF,_Behold how you can’t behold me!_
4559,THE RED WOLF,_The invisible in its shroud!_
4560,THE RED WOLF,
4561,THE RED WOLF,"Now that the sun has gone, and the aspen leaves"
4562,THE RED WOLF,"And the cotton-wood leaves are fallen, as good as fallen,"
4563,THE RED WOLF,"And the ponies are in corral,"
4564,THE RED WOLF,And it’s night.
4565,THE RED WOLF,
4566,THE RED WOLF,"Why, more has gone than all these;"
4567,THE RED WOLF,And something has come.
4568,THE RED WOLF,A red wolf stands on the shadow’s dark red rim.
4569,THE RED WOLF,
4570,THE RED WOLF,Day has gone to dust on the sage-grey desert
4571,THE RED WOLF,Like a white Christus fallen to dust from a cross;
4572,THE RED WOLF,"To dust, to ash, on the twilit floor of the desert."
4573,THE RED WOLF,
4574,THE RED WOLF,And a black crucifix like a dead tree spreading wings;
4575,THE RED WOLF,Maybe a black eagle with its wings out
4576,THE RED WOLF,Left lonely in the night
4577,THE RED WOLF,In a sort of worship.
4578,THE RED WOLF,
4579,THE RED WOLF,"And coming down upon us, out of the dark concave"
4580,THE RED WOLF,"Of the eagle’s wings,"
4581,THE RED WOLF,"And the coffin-like slit where the Indians’ eyes are,"
4582,THE RED WOLF,"And the absence of cotton-wood leaves, or of aspen,"
4583,THE RED WOLF,Even the absence of dark-crossed donkeys:
4584,THE RED WOLF,"Come tall old demons, smiling"
4585,THE RED WOLF,"The Indian smile,"
4586,THE RED WOLF,"Saying: _How do you do, you pale-face?_"
4587,THE RED WOLF,
4588,THE RED WOLF,"I am very well, old demon."
4589,THE RED WOLF,How are you?
4590,THE RED WOLF,
4591,THE RED WOLF,"_Call me Harry if you will,_"
4592,THE RED WOLF,_Call me Old Harry says he._
4593,THE RED WOLF,"_Or the abbreviation of Nicolas,_"
4594,THE RED WOLF,"_Nick. Old Nick, maybe._"
4595,THE RED WOLF,
4596,THE RED WOLF,"Well, you’re a dark old demon,"
4597,THE RED WOLF,And I’m a pale-face like a homeless dog
4598,THE RED WOLF,That has followed the sun from the dawn through the east
4599,THE RED WOLF,"Trotting east and east and east till the sun himself went home,"
4600,THE RED WOLF,And left me homeless here in the dark at your door.
4601,THE RED WOLF,"How do you think we’ll get on,"
4602,THE RED WOLF,"Old demon, you and I?"
4603,THE RED WOLF,
4604,THE RED WOLF,"_You and I, you pale-face,_"
4605,THE RED WOLF,_Pale-face you and I_
4606,THE RED WOLF,_Don’t get on._
4607,THE RED WOLF,
4608,THE RED WOLF,Mightn’t we try?
4609,THE RED WOLF,
4610,THE RED WOLF,"_Where’s your God, you white one?_"
4611,THE RED WOLF,_Where’s your white God?_
4612,THE RED WOLF,
4613,THE RED WOLF,"He fell to dust as the twilight fell,"
4614,THE RED WOLF,Was fume as I trod
4615,THE RED WOLF,The last step out of the east.
4616,THE RED WOLF,
4617,THE RED WOLF,"_Then you’re a lost white dog of a pale-face,_"
4618,THE RED WOLF,_And the days now dead...._
4619,THE RED WOLF,
4620,THE RED WOLF,"Touch me carefully, old father,"
4621,THE RED WOLF,My beard is red.
4622,THE RED WOLF,
4623,THE RED WOLF,"_Thin red wolf of a pale-face,_"
4624,THE RED WOLF,"_Thin red wolf, go home._"
4625,THE RED WOLF,
4626,THE RED WOLF,"I have no home, old father,"
4627,THE RED WOLF,That’s why I come.
4628,THE RED WOLF,
4629,THE RED WOLF,_We take no hungry stray from the pale-face ..._
4630,THE RED WOLF,
4631,THE RED WOLF,"Father, you are not asked."
4632,THE RED WOLF,I am come. I am here. The red-dawn-wolf
4633,THE RED WOLF,Sniffs round your place.
4634,THE RED WOLF,"Lifts up his voice and howls to the walls of the pueblo,"
4635,THE RED WOLF,Announcing he’s here.
4636,THE RED WOLF,
4637,THE RED WOLF,_The dogs of the dark pueblo_
4638,THE RED WOLF,_Have long fangs ..._
4639,THE RED WOLF,
4640,THE RED WOLF,Has the red wolf trotted east and east and east
4641,THE RED WOLF,"From the far, far other end of the day"
4642,THE RED WOLF,To fear a few fangs?
4643,THE RED WOLF,
4644,THE RED WOLF,Across the pueblo river
4645,THE RED WOLF,That dark old demon and I
4646,THE RED WOLF,Thus say a few words to each other
4647,THE RED WOLF,
4648,THE RED WOLF,"And wolf, he calls me, and red."
4649,THE RED WOLF,I call him no names.
4650,THE RED WOLF,"He says, however, he is Star-Road."
4651,THE RED WOLF,"I say, he can go back the same gait."
4652,THE RED WOLF,
4653,THE RED WOLF,As for me ...
4654,THE RED WOLF,Since I trotted at the tail of the sun as far as ever the creature went
4655,THE RED WOLF,"west,"
4656,THE RED WOLF,"And lost him here,"
4657,THE RED WOLF,I’m going to sit down on my tail right here
4658,THE RED WOLF,And wait for him to come back with a new story.
4659,THE RED WOLF,"I’m the red wolf, says the dark old father."
4660,THE RED WOLF,"All right, the red dawn wolf I am."

4693,MEN IN NEW MEXICO,"From fear,"

4710,MEN IN NEW MEXICO,The Penitentes lash themselves till they run with blood

4713,MEN IN NEW MEXICO,No good.

4907,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,THE AMERICAN EAGLE
4908,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,
4909,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,
4910,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,The dove of Liberty sat on an egg
4911,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,And hatched another eagle.
4912,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,
4913,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,But didn’t disown the bird.
4914,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,
4915,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,_Down with all eagles!_ cooed the Dove.
4916,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,"And down all eagles began to flutter, reeling from their perches:"
4917,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,"Eagles with two heads, eagles with one, presently eagles with none"
4918,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,Fell from the hooks and were dead.
4919,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,
4920,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,Till the American Eagle was the only eagle left in the world.
4921,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,
4922,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,"Then it began to fidget, shifting from one leg to the other,"
4923,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,"Trying to look like a pelican,"
4924,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,And plucking out of his plumage a few loose feathers to feather the nests
4925,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,of all
4926,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,The new naked little republics come into the world.
4927,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,
4928,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,"But the feathers were, comparatively, a mere flea-bite."
4929,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,And the bub-eagle that Liberty had hatched was growing a startling big bird
4930,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,On the roof of the world;
4931,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,"A bit awkward, and with a funny squawk in his voice,"
4932,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,His mother Liberty trying always to teach him to coo
4933,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,And him always ending with a yawp
4934,THE AMERICAN EAGLE,_Coo! Coo! Coo! Coo-ark! Coo-ark! Quark!! Quark!!_
4935,YAWP!!!,YAWP!!!
4936,YAWP!!!,
4937,YAWP!!!,"So he clears his throat, the young Cock-eagle!"
4938,YAWP!!!,
4939,YAWP!!!,Now if the lilies of France lick Solomon in all his glory;
4940,YAWP!!!,And the leopard cannot change his spots;
4941,YAWP!!!,Nor the British lion his appetite;
4942,YAWP!!!,Neither can a young Cock-eagle sit simpering
4943,YAWP!!!,With an olive-sprig in his mouth.
4944,YAWP!!!,
4945,YAWP!!!,It’s not his nature.
4946,YAWP!!!,
4947,YAWP!!!,"The big bird of the Amerindian being the eagle,"
4948,YAWP!!!,"Red Men still stick themselves over with bits of his fluff,"
4949,YAWP!!!,And feel absolutely IT.
4950,YAWP!!!,
4951,YAWP!!!,"So better make up your mind, American Eagle,"
4952,YAWP!!!,"Whether you’re a sucking dove, _Roo--coo--ooo! Quark! Yawp!!_"
4953,YAWP!!!,Or a pelican
4954,YAWP!!!,"Handing out a few loose golden breast-feathers, at moulting time;"
4955,YAWP!!!,Or a sort of prosperity-gander
4956,YAWP!!!,Fathering endless ten-dollar golden eggs.
4957,YAWP!!!,
4958,YAWP!!!,"Or whether it actually is an eagle you are,"
4959,YAWP!!!,With a Roman nose
4960,YAWP!!!,"And claws not made to shake hands with,"
4961,YAWP!!!,And a Me-Almighty eye.
4962,YAWP!!!,
4963,YAWP!!!,The new Proud Republic

4967,YAWP!!!,"Eagle of the Rockies, bird of men that are masters,"
4968,YAWP!!!,"Lifting the rabbit-blood of the myriads up into something splendid,"
4969,YAWP!!!,Leaving a few bones;
4970,YAWP!!!,Opening great wings in the face of the sheep-faced ewe
4971,YAWP!!!,"Who is losing her lamb,"
4972,YAWP!!!,"Drinking a little blood, and loosing another royalty unto the world."
4973,YAWP!!!,
4974,YAWP!!!,"Is that you, American Eagle?"
4975,YAWP!!!,
4976,YAWP!!!,Or are you the goose that lays the golden egg?
4977,YAWP!!!,Which is just a stone to anyone asking for meat.
4978,YAWP!!!,And are you going to go on for ever
4979,YAWP!!!,"Laying that golden egg,"
4980,YAWP!!!,That addled golden egg?
