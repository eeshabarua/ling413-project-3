128,TO MARGOT,Nobody--nobody will be there

137,THE LINNET,
138,THE LINNET,Upon this leafy bush
139,THE LINNET,"With thorns and roses in it,"
140,THE LINNET,"Flutters a thing of light,"
141,THE LINNET,A twittering linnet.
142,THE LINNET,And all the throbbing world
143,THE LINNET,Of dew and sun and air
144,THE LINNET,By this small parcel of life
145,THE LINNET,Is made more fair;
146,THE LINNET,As if each bramble-spray
147,THE LINNET,"And mounded gold-wreathed furze,"
148,THE LINNET,"Harebell and little thyme,"
149,THE LINNET,Were only hers;
150,THE LINNET,As if this beauty and grace
151,THE LINNET,"Did to one bird belong,"
152,THE LINNET,"And, at a flutter of wing,"
153,THE LINNET,Might vanish in song.

159,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,
160,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,Speak not--whisper not;
161,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,Here bloweth thyme and bergamot;
162,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Softly on the evening hour,"
163,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Secret herbs their spices shower,"
164,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Dark-spiked rosemary and myrrh,"
165,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Lean-stalked, purple lavender;"
166,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Hides within her bosom, too,"
167,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"All her sorrows, bitter rue."
168,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,
169,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,Breathe not--trespass not;
170,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Of this green and darkling spot,"
171,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Latticed from the moon's beams,"
172,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,Perchance a distant dreamer dreams;
173,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Perchance upon its darkening air,"
174,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"The unseen ghosts of children fare,"
175,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"Faintly swinging, sway and sweep,"
176,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,Like lovely sea-flowers in its deep;
177,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"While, unmoved, to watch and ward,"
178,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,"'Mid its gloomed and daisied sward,"
179,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,Stands with bowed and dewy head
180,THE SUNKEN GARDEN,That one little leaden Lad.

186,THE RIDDLERS,
187,THE RIDDLERS,"'Thou solitary!' the Blackbird cried,"
188,THE RIDDLERS,"'I, from the happy Wren,"
189,THE RIDDLERS,"Linnet and Blackcap, Woodlark, Thrush,"
190,THE RIDDLERS,"Perched all upon a sweetbrier bush,"
191,THE RIDDLERS,Have come at cold of midnight-tide
192,THE RIDDLERS,"To ask thee, Why and when"
193,THE RIDDLERS,Grief smote thy heart so thou dost sing
194,THE RIDDLERS,"In solemn hush of evening,"
195,THE RIDDLERS,"So sorrowfully, lovelorn Thing--"
196,THE RIDDLERS,"Nay, nay, not sing, but rave, but wail,"
197,THE RIDDLERS,Most melancholic Nightingale?
198,THE RIDDLERS,Do not the dews of darkness steep
199,THE RIDDLERS,All pinings of the day in sleep?
200,THE RIDDLERS,"Why, then, when rocked in starry nest"
201,THE RIDDLERS,"We mutely couch, secure, at rest,"
202,THE RIDDLERS,Doth thy lone heart delight to make
203,THE RIDDLERS,Music for sorrow's sake?'
204,THE RIDDLERS,
205,THE RIDDLERS,"A Moon was there.  So still her beam,"
206,THE RIDDLERS,"It seemed the whole world lay a-dream,"
207,THE RIDDLERS,Lulled by the watery sea.
208,THE RIDDLERS,And from her leafy night-hung nook
209,THE RIDDLERS,Upon this stranger soft did look
210,THE RIDDLERS,The Nightingale: sighed he:--
211,THE RIDDLERS,
212,THE RIDDLERS,"''Tis strange, my friend; the Kingfisher"
213,THE RIDDLERS,But yestermorn conjured me here
214,THE RIDDLERS,Out of his green and gold to say
215,THE RIDDLERS,"Why thou, in splendour of the noon,"
216,THE RIDDLERS,"Wearest of colour but golden shoon,"
217,THE RIDDLERS,And else dost thee array
218,THE RIDDLERS,In a most sombre suit of black?
219,THE RIDDLERS,"""Surely,"" he sighed, ""some load of grief,"
220,THE RIDDLERS,Past all our thinking--and belief--
221,THE RIDDLERS,"Must weigh upon his back!"""
222,THE RIDDLERS,"Do, then, in turn, tell me, If joy"
223,THE RIDDLERS,"Thy heart as well as voice employ,"
224,THE RIDDLERS,"Why dost thou now, most Sable, shine"
225,THE RIDDLERS,In plumage woefuller far than mine?
226,THE RIDDLERS,Thy silence is a sadder thing
227,THE RIDDLERS,Than any dirge I sing!'
228,THE RIDDLERS,
229,THE RIDDLERS,"Thus then these two small birds, perched there,"
230,THE RIDDLERS,Breathed a strange riddle both did share
231,THE RIDDLERS,Yet neither could expound.
232,THE RIDDLERS,"And we--who sing but as we can,"
233,THE RIDDLERS,In the small knowledge of a man--
234,THE RIDDLERS,Have we an answer found?
235,THE RIDDLERS,"Nay, some are happy whose delight"
236,THE RIDDLERS,Is hid even from themselves from sight;
237,THE RIDDLERS,And some win peace who spend
238,THE RIDDLERS,The skill of words to sweeten despair
239,THE RIDDLERS,Of finding consolation where
240,THE RIDDLERS,Life has but one dark end;
241,THE RIDDLERS,"Who, in rapt solitude, tell o'er"
242,THE RIDDLERS,"A tale, as lovely as forlore,"
243,THE RIDDLERS,Into the midnight air.

249,MOONLIGHT,
250,MOONLIGHT,The far moon maketh lovers wise
251,MOONLIGHT,"In her pale beauty trembling down,"
252,MOONLIGHT,"Lending curved cheeks, dark lips, dark eyes,"
253,MOONLIGHT,A strangeness not their own.
254,MOONLIGHT,"And, though they shut their lids to kiss,"
255,MOONLIGHT,"In starless darkness peace to win,"
256,MOONLIGHT,Even on that secret world from this
257,MOONLIGHT,Her twilight enters in.

264,THE BLIND BOY,"'I have no master,' said the Blind Boy,"
265,THE BLIND BOY,"My mother, ""Dame Venus,"" they do call;"
266,THE BLIND BOY,"Cowled in this hood, she sent me begging"
267,THE BLIND BOY,For whate'er in pity may befall.
268,THE BLIND BOY,
269,THE BLIND BOY,"'Hard was her visage, me adjuring,--"
270,THE BLIND BOY,"""Have no fond mercy on the kind!"
271,THE BLIND BOY,"Here be sharp arrows, bunched in quiver,"
272,THE BLIND BOY,"Draw close ere striking--thou art blind."""
273,THE BLIND BOY,
274,THE BLIND BOY,"'So stand I here, my woes entreating,"
275,THE BLIND BOY,"In this dark alley, lest the Moon"
276,THE BLIND BOY,"Point with her sparkling my barbed armoury,"
277,THE BLIND BOY,Shine on my silver-laced shoon.
278,THE BLIND BOY,
279,THE BLIND BOY,"'Oh, sir, unkind this Dame to me-ward;"
280,THE BLIND BOY,Of the salt billow was her birth....
281,THE BLIND BOY,In your sweet charity draw nearer
282,THE BLIND BOY,The saddest rogue on Earth!'

288,THE QUARRY,
289,THE QUARRY,"You hunted me with all the pack,"
290,THE QUARRY,"Too blind, too blind, to see"
291,THE QUARRY,By no wild hope of force or greed
292,THE QUARRY,Could you make sure of me.
293,THE QUARRY,
294,THE QUARRY,"And like a phantom through the glades,"
295,THE QUARRY,"With tender breast aglow,"
296,THE QUARRY,The goddess in me laughed to hear
297,THE QUARRY,Your horns a-roving go.
298,THE QUARRY,
299,THE QUARRY,She laughed to think no mortal e'er
300,THE QUARRY,By dint of mortal flesh
301,THE QUARRY,The very Cause that was the Hunt
302,THE QUARRY,One moment could enmesh:
303,THE QUARRY,
304,THE QUARRY,"That though with captive limbs I lay,"
305,THE QUARRY,"Stilled breath and vanquished eyes,"
306,THE QUARRY,He that hunts Love with horse and hound
307,THE QUARRY,Hunts out his heart and eyes.

313,MRS. GRUNDY,
314,MRS. GRUNDY,"'Step very softly, sweet Quiet-foot,"
315,MRS. GRUNDY,"Stumble not, whisper not, smile not:"
316,MRS. GRUNDY,By this dark ivy stoop cheek and brow.
317,MRS. GRUNDY,Still even thy heart!  What seest thou?'
318,MRS. GRUNDY,
319,MRS. GRUNDY,"'High-coifed, broad-browed, aged, suave yet grim,"
320,MRS. GRUNDY,"A large flat face, eyes keenly dim,"
321,MRS. GRUNDY,"Staring at nothing--that's me!--and yet,"
322,MRS. GRUNDY,"With a hate one could never, no, never forget...'"
323,MRS. GRUNDY,
324,MRS. GRUNDY,"'This is my world, my garden, my home,"
325,MRS. GRUNDY,Hither my father bade mother to come
326,MRS. GRUNDY,"And bear me out of the dark into light,"
327,MRS. GRUNDY,And happy I was in her tender sight.
328,MRS. GRUNDY,
329,MRS. GRUNDY,"'And then, thou frail flower, she died and went,"
330,MRS. GRUNDY,"Forgetting my pitiless banishment,"
331,MRS. GRUNDY,"And that Old Woman--an Aunt--she said,"
332,MRS. GRUNDY,"Came hither, lodged, fattened, and made her bed."
333,MRS. GRUNDY,
334,MRS. GRUNDY,"'Oh yes, thou most blessed, from Monday to Sunday"
335,MRS. GRUNDY,"Has lived on me, preyed on me, Mrs. Grundy:"
336,MRS. GRUNDY,"Called me, ""dear Nephew""; on each of those chairs"
337,MRS. GRUNDY,"Has gloated in righteousness, heard my prayers."
338,MRS. GRUNDY,
339,MRS. GRUNDY,"'Why didst thou dare the thorns of the grove,"
340,MRS. GRUNDY,"Timidest trespasser, huntress of love?"
341,MRS. GRUNDY,"Now thou hast peeped, and now dost know"
342,MRS. GRUNDY,What kind of creature is thine for foe.
343,MRS. GRUNDY,
344,MRS. GRUNDY,"'Not that she'll tear out thy innocent eyes,"
345,MRS. GRUNDY,Poison thy mouth with deviltries.
346,MRS. GRUNDY,"Watch thou, wait thou: soon will begin"
347,MRS. GRUNDY,"The guile of a voice: hark!...' 'Come in, Come in!'"

354,THE TRYST,Flee into some forgotten night and be
355,THE TRYST,Of all dark long my moon-bright company:
356,THE TRYST,"Beyond the rumour even of Paradise come,"
357,THE TRYST,"There, out of all remembrance, make our home:"
358,THE TRYST,"Seek we some close hid shadow for our lair,"
359,THE TRYST,Hollowed by Noah's mouse beneath the chair
360,THE TRYST,"Wherein the Omnipotent, in slumber bound,"
361,THE TRYST,Nods till the piteous Trump of Judgment sound.
362,THE TRYST,Perchance Leviathan of the deep sea
363,THE TRYST,"Would lease a lost mermaiden's grot to me,"
364,THE TRYST,There of your beauty we would joyance make--
365,THE TRYST,A music wistful for the sea-nymph's sake:
366,THE TRYST,"Haply Elijah, o'er his spokes of fibre,"
367,THE TRYST,"Cresting steep Leo, or the heavenly Lyre,"
368,THE TRYST,"Spied, tranced in azure of inanest space,"
369,THE TRYST,"Some eyrie hostel, meet for human grace,"
370,THE TRYST,Where two might happy be--just you and I--
371,THE TRYST,Lost in the uttermost of Eternity.
372,THE TRYST,
373,THE TRYST,Think! in Time's smallest clock's minutest beat
374,THE TRYST,Might there not rest be found for wandering feet?
375,THE TRYST,"Or, 'twixt the sleep and wake of a Helen's dream,"
376,THE TRYST,Silence wherein to sing love's requiem?
377,THE TRYST,
378,THE TRYST,"No, no.  Nor earth, nor air, nor fire, nor deep"
379,THE TRYST,Could lull poor mortal longingness asleep.
380,THE TRYST,Somewhere there Nothing is; and there lost Man
381,THE TRYST,Shall win what changeless vague of peace he can.

431,THE EMPTY HOUSE,"With its tiny voice, and then"
432,THE EMPTY HOUSE,Hush falls again.
433,THE EMPTY HOUSE,
434,THE EMPTY HOUSE,Mute shadows creeping slow
435,THE EMPTY HOUSE,Mark how the hours go.
436,THE EMPTY HOUSE,Every stone is mouldering slow.

438,THE EMPTY HOUSE,"Some minutest atom shake,"

456,MISTRESS FELL,"'I did not look, so cannot tell."
457,MISTRESS FELL,"Only this I surely know,"
458,MISTRESS FELL,"When his voice called me, I must go;"
459,MISTRESS FELL,"Touched me his fingers, and my heart"
460,MISTRESS FELL,Leapt at the sweet pain's smart.'

463,MISTRESS FELL,'Magic laid its dreary spell.--

1429,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,
1430,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,For all the grief I have given with words
1431,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,"May now a few clear flowers blow,"
1432,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,"In the dust, and the heat, and the silence of birds,"
1433,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,Where the lonely go.
1434,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,
1435,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,For the thing unsaid that heart asked of me
1436,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,"Be a dark, cool water calling--calling"
1437,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,"To the footsore, benighted, solitary,"
1438,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,When the shadows are falling.
1439,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,
1440,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,"O, be beauty for all my blindness,"
1441,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,"A moon in the air where the weary wend,"
1442,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,And dews burdened with loving-kindness
1443,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,In the dark of the end.
1444,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,
1445,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,
1446,FOR ALL THE GRIEF,

1463,THE SCRIBE,"To write of Earth's wonders,"
1464,THE SCRIBE,"Its live, willed things,"
1465,THE SCRIBE,Flit would the ages
1466,THE SCRIBE,On soundless wings
1467,THE SCRIBE,Ere unto Z
1468,THE SCRIBE,My pen drew nigh;
1469,THE SCRIBE,"Leviathan told,"
1470,THE SCRIBE,And the honey-fly:
1471,THE SCRIBE,And still would remain
1472,THE SCRIBE,My wit to try--
1473,THE SCRIBE,"My worn reeds broken,"
1474,THE SCRIBE,"The dark tarn dry,"
1475,THE SCRIBE,All words forgotten--
