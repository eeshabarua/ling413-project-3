42,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
43,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
44,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
45,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,If you will stop and take a drink
46,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Where I did, late one afternoon"
47,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"In April, you may see turn pink"
48,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"A patch of snow, which very soon"
49,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Yellows to green: it seems quite near;
50,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"But is, in fact, up Norcia way"
51,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Or further: the effect's more queer
52,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Than beautiful: and should you say
53,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"To the _padrone_, Gian Mannino,"
54,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"""What peak is that which looks so odd?"""
55,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"He'll answer, ""Monte Sibillino--"
56,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"But they've bunged up the hole, thank God."""
57,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Herr Hans Van Branbourg, 1310"
58,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"To 1352 or so,--"
59,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"(A period, it seems, when men"
60,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Not unlike us were apt to go
61,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Five hundred miles to get a thrill
62,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"They might have had for sitting still),--"
63,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Branbourg, I say, having done the lakes"
64,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"And all the sights of La Toscana,"
65,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"(A jaunt which now a fortnight takes,"
66,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Less then, because one skipped Verona,"
67,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"""The Tomb"" not having found its owner[1]),"
68,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Came southward by the Val Chiana;
69,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Heard of the Sybil, wouldn't wait,--no,"
70,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Not a moment, at Spoleto,"
71,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,But set off promptly for the cave.
72,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"The natives told him he was brave,--"
73,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Thinking him mad. Had not a monk,"
74,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Il don Antonio Fumato,"
75,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"There lost his wits, and, in a funk,"
76,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Five bold young bucks from near Fossato,"
77,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Who made the same attempt before,"
78,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"At what they heard and what they saw,"
79,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"(Or was that later?) quaked like jelly,"
80,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Shaming the sires of Gabrielle?
81,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"They had seen things to make saints curse,--"
82,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"A gate that kept on clipping, clipping,"
83,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"(Much like a storm-door only worse,)"
84,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,And bound to give you such a nipping
85,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"As nips the persons, now and then,"
86,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Of thoughtless, shunting, railway-men."
87,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"They had felt strange and ghastly winds,"
88,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"They had heard strange and sudden noises,"
89,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,And what in Italy one finds
90,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"More rarely, gentle, whispering voices:"
91,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,'Twas woman's doing--never doubt it--
92,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,A female influence ruled the air;
93,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,And what the coarser said about it
94,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Was, that although when you got there"
95,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"The place might seem an honest hovel,"
96,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Inside, they guessed, you'd find a brothel."
97,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
98,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
99,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Indeed it was a dangerous place.
100,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"But Germans are a stubborn race,"
101,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Not to say obstinate, to boot"
102,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Are fond of ladies: Herr Van Bran
103,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Swore that if anyone could do't
104,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"He, Hans Van Branbourg, was the man;"
105,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Pushed on to Norcia, then climbed higher,"
106,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"And with him went a single squire,"
107,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Called Pons--they say an Englishman,"
108,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"I hope he was, because I can"
109,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,(As you I think will soon agree)
110,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Pronounce him brave as brave can be,"
111,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Yet sensible as Sancho Panza,"
112,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Wherewith I neatly close the stanza.
113,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
114,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
115,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"The knight pushed on, the squire behind,"
116,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"They cared not tuppence for the wind,"
117,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Nor for the strange and sudden noises,"
118,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Nor the discreetly whispering voices,"
119,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Nor all those signs which long ago
120,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Did duty for a ""_numero_""."
121,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,They passed the gates of bronze. They came
122,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,To gates of crystal. Here they tapped.
123,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,A lady-porter asked their name:
124,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Whereat the leader boldly rapped
125,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Out that which you've already heard, viz:--"
126,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"""Herr Hans Van Branbourg, at your service."""
127,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"The doors flew wide, and to their eyes"
128,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Revealed the Sibyl's paradise.
129,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
130,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
131,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"What saw they? Antoine de la Sale,"
132,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Who wrote _Les quinze joies_ and all
133,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"_Les cent nouvelles nouvelles_ as well,"
134,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,What I could not invent can tell;
135,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Seeing he came in 1420
136,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"To hold an inquest on the spot,"
137,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"And information got in plenty,--"
138,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Indeed he clambered to the grot,"
139,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,But only peeped inside the cavern--
140,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Later, however, at the tavern"
141,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,He learnt the truth of what befell
142,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Van Branbourg in the Sybil's hell.
143,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,They saw a crowd of pretty girls--
144,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,These were the Sybil's seneschals--
145,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Who bade them change their dirty linen
146,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"And rigged them out ""from the beginning"""
147,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,(The text has _ab initio_);
148,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Up strike the fiddles; off they go
149,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Through pretty rooms and splendid halls
150,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"And gardens framed in sheltering walls,"
151,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,The which were gay with flowers as well
152,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"As comely ""_dames et demoiselles_""."
153,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Accompanied by knights and squires
154,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"In divers fashionable attires,"
155,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Much as our Longchamps beauties go
156,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Surrounded by their _gigolos._
157,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
158,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
159,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Gaping they go; until they see
160,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"'La reine Sibylle', who from her throne"
161,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Welcomed the strangers graciously,"
162,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Observing she'd already known
163,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Men of their race, which (_vide Tacite_)"
164,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Was honest, brave, but inficite,[2]"
165,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,And only that for want of practice
166,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,In social arts and crafts. The fact is
167,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"She much admired the Teuton physique,"
168,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"(I know some ladies can't abide it),"
169,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"So murmured, ""You're my guests for this week:"
170,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Later you'll tell me, when you've tried it,"
171,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,If you'll become my _pensionnaires._
172,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,I'll only add that we are here
173,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Until the crack of doom. And then?"""
174,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Queried our cautious gentlemen.
175,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
176,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
177,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"""Then we shall see what we shall see,"""
178,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Answered the lady airily,"
179,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Fobbing them off with such old saws
180,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,As rarely fail to elicit roars
181,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Of laughter from the House and Bar,"
182,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"--As ""Wait and see"" and ""Chi lo sa"";"
183,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Then, sweetly added, ""If you please,"
184,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Hear our conditions, which are these."
185,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Who stays
186,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Eight days
187,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,May go away the next.
188,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,On no pretext
189,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Who stays more
190,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,May or durst
191,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Go before
192,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,The thirty-first.
193,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Who yet stays more
194,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Must outstay
195,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,By one day
196,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,His fifteenth score.
197,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Then or never:
198,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,For who stays
199,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Further days
200,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Stays for ever,[3]"
201,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"""Further,"" said she, ""if you will be"
202,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"My guests, this Paradise of mine"
203,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Is at your service; what you see
204,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Of fun and beauty, flowers and wine,"
205,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Is for your pleasure: also choose
206,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Amongst my ladies who are free
207,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,(There're always plenty on the loose)
208,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Her who most charms you. Certainly
209,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"You'll find them charming, trained to please,"
210,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"To move with grace, converse with ease,"
211,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Well bred, well dressed, well read, well meant,"
212,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"In all ways sweetly competent:"""
213,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Whereat squire Pons was ""moult"" content,"
214,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"And, plucking at his master's jacket,"
215,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Said ""Sir, let's stay and stand the racket."""
216,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
217,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
218,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,They said they'd stay a week; but when
219,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,The week was up they stayed again;
220,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Indeed ""_les plaisirs étaient tels_"""
221,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Days seemed like hours in that hell:
222,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"So says La Sale, who ought to know"
223,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"What pleasures seemed like years ago,"
224,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Seeing he wrote ""_Les quinze joies"
225,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"De Mariage_"", but then, _ma foi_,"
226,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,They took their pleasures[4] otherwise
227,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Than husbands in that Paradise.
228,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
229,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
230,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"It was an abbey of Thelème,"
231,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Compounded with Arabian nights;
232,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Where every sort of pretty game
233,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,And wit and wine and all delights
234,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Were shared with pretty, clever girls,"
235,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Who never dreamed of being pals;
236,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"But were what girls should always be,"
237,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"In manner prim, in fancy free."
238,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Thus was there hope for everyone,"
239,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"All were fastidious, none was prude,"
240,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Which means flirtation's ticklish fun
241,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Supplanted dreary certitude.
242,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"There was the best of everything,"
243,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Of wine, of song, and all the rest,"
244,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"The best to drink, to kiss, to sing,"
245,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,And taste to know what is the best.
246,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,A match for every mood: to please
247,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"The thoughtful, cloisters; polished halls"
248,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,For dancers; vines and olive trees
249,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,And rivers under ancient walls
250,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Flowing, for every heart's delight,--"
251,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Were there: and there was rest by day and mirth by
252,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,night.
253,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
254,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
255,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Music there was in every part;
256,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,And almost always you could hear
257,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"A song or septet by Mozart,"
258,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,And not a note of Meyerbeer.
259,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,There story-tellers had a way
260,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Of being neither dull nor long
261,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"But, like Voltaire or Mérimée,"
262,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Were rarely sweet and never strong.
263,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Perrons, parterres and green pelouses"
264,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Abounded; walks of turf and sand;
265,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,And restaurants like La Pérouse;
266,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Fiddles and horns, and no Jazz Band."
267,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"There were no bounders and no bores,"
268,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"No reach-me-downs, no general stores,"
269,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"No clubs, no colonels, not a hearty"
270,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Good fellow there to spoil a party,"
271,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"No district-visitor or pastor,"
272,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,And not a sign of Lady Astor.
273,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"There were no 'cinemas', no groups"
274,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Of shop boys, no colonial troops,"
275,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"No one who hit straight from the shoulder,"
276,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,And not a season-ticket holder;
277,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"There was nor creditor nor debtor,"
278,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,There was not in that pleasant land
279,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"A soul who wished to make it better,"
280,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,All were content to understand
281,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Their happiness; nay, what is more,"
282,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,No lady wanted for her lover
283,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"That kind of smutty, solemn bore,"
284,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Who sick with genius, must uncover"
285,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,For our souls' good his nasty sore:
286,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Believe me there did not exist
287,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"A single, small coprologist."
288,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,So simple-minded were the ladies
289,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,In that old-fashioned Sibyl's Hades.
290,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
291,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
292,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Alas I pure joy the fates forbid.
293,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Alas! that poet's not an ass
294,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Who has it that an _aliquid_
295,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,_Amari_ rises in the glass
296,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Almost invariably when we
297,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Suppose we've cheated destiny.
298,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
299,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
300,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Van Branbourg, and his British pup too,"
301,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Observed that every Friday night,"
302,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"No matter what they might be up to,"
303,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,The partners of their dear delight
304,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Slipped off at twelve, upon the stroke,"
305,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"And left them puzzling out the joke,"
306,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"As best they might, till Monday morning;"
307,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"When back their ladies came more kind,"
308,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"More sweet, than ever. But this warning"
309,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Served to unsettle Branbourg's mind.
310,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"He had a Lutheran soul. What malice,"
311,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,What mischief might they be about?
312,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"He tracked them to the Sybil's palace,"
313,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,And there it was he found them out.
314,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"From Friday night to Monday morning,"
315,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"He found these artless, frolick gadders,"
316,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Who left their lovers without warning,"
317,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Lay with their queen, asleep like adders;"
318,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Not in a peaceful girlish doze,"
319,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,But serpentlike and comatose.[5]
320,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"""Pish,"" said the squire, ""here are no evils."""
321,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"The German said, ""These girls are devils."""
322,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
323,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
324,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"His northern soul was deeply stirred,"
325,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"He said--""My man, it's time we went,"""
326,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Which good squire Pons thought quite absurd,"
327,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"And said so. ""Pons, d'you know we've spent"
328,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Here,"" groaned his chief, ""three hundred days,"
329,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Abounding in lascivious ways.
330,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Pack up, and say 'good-bye' my man."""
331,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Thus spoke the Prussian Knight, Van Bran."
332,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
333,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
334,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"The ladies, as you may suppose,"
335,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Were _navrées, marrieés_, quite upset."
336,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,They had to let them go because
337,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Such was the formal bargain. Yet
338,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"They used all arts against all rules,"
339,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"As Dido did. The gentlemen,"
340,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Much like Aenæas, looked like fools,"
341,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"And acting now as he did then,"
342,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"First sighed, then blustered, lastly went:"
343,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Such is the heroic temperament.
344,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
345,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
346,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"They went to see the Pope at Rome,"
347,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,To beg his Holiness's pardon:
348,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"And though the Suisse said ""Not at home"","
349,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,They caught him reading in the garden:
350,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Down furiously the book he slammed,"
351,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"And bellowed ""You may both be damned."""
352,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
353,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
354,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"In this some hold the Pope was wrong,"
355,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,And went by much beyond his brief:
356,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"But that's no matter to my song,"
357,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Nor can it give us great relief
358,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,That Lettenhove speaks of a stick
359,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Which played the old Tannhäuser trick,"
360,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Bourgeoning into buds of pity,"
361,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,After our friends had left the city.
362,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"The Pope, he adds, was quite upset,"
363,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"And owned he'd spoken out of pet,"
364,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Was strangely troubled for their fate,"
365,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Sent absolution--all too late:
366,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"For which, he thinks, the Pope must go"
367,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,To join his victims down below.
368,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,You may conceive the lamentation
369,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Of our poor knight on this occasion.
370,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"He was, like others of his nation,"
371,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,A damned good fellow--only flabby--
372,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Who, on the slightest provocation,"
373,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,Would fight or weep. A speech so shabby
374,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"As this, he took to heart, because"
375,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,His sense of sin increased his fears;
376,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"So, on the Milvian Bridge it was"
377,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"His squire found him, bathed in tears,"
378,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,And gathered it was his intent
379,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,To jump from off that monument.
380,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
381,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,
382,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,And here our Pons was at his best;
383,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"He turned the scene from tears to laughter,"
384,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"Said ""Cheer-i-o"" and all the rest"
385,_TO POLLY FLINDERS_,"The case demanded: ""Since hereafter"

425,INTRAVIT.,"Years later, Monsieur Gaston Paris,"
426,INTRAVIT.,"That learned Frenchman, came this way."
427,INTRAVIT.,It poured with rain. He could not tarry.
428,INTRAVIT.,He gave the cave a single day.
429,INTRAVIT.,He noticed that the mouth was blocked
430,INTRAVIT.,"And asked the peasants 'why', who, shocked,"
431,INTRAVIT.,Informed him how on summer nights
432,INTRAVIT.,The Sybil and her horrid sprites
433,INTRAVIT.,"Came out and danced their hellish jigs,"
434,INTRAVIT.,And crushed the corn and scared the pigs.
435,INTRAVIT.,On which unamiable narration
436,INTRAVIT.,The _savant_ made this observation--
437,INTRAVIT.,That they were very simple fools
438,INTRAVIT.,"To put their trust in masons' tools,"
439,INTRAVIT.,"Seeing that fiends, our souls' ill-wishers,"
440,INTRAVIT.,Slip slyly through the smallest fissures.
441,INTRAVIT.,"And, in effect, for all their skill,"
442,INTRAVIT.,"The peasants owned, _they dance there still._"

444,INTRAVIT.,
445,INTRAVIT.,"O Hans Van Branbourg, I applaud"
446,INTRAVIT.,"You first, remembering you're a lord;"
447,INTRAVIT.,"And next the not-to-be-forgot,"
448,INTRAVIT.,"Your squire and my compatriot,"
449,INTRAVIT.,"Him, Pons. For since we're far from sure"
450,INTRAVIT.,"If Heaven will prove a sinecure,"
451,INTRAVIT.,And seeing that it's quite uncertain
452,INTRAVIT.,What fate awaits beyond the curtain;
453,INTRAVIT.,"Seeing you wanton down the years,"
454,INTRAVIT.,"While we are in the vale of tears,"
455,INTRAVIT.,And even thus the odds are even
456,INTRAVIT.,"On waking up in Hell or Heaven,"
457,INTRAVIT.,While many hold the odds not small
458,INTRAVIT.,Against our waking up at all;
459,INTRAVIT.,I can't but think that you were wise
460,INTRAVIT.,To choose the Sibyl's paradise:
461,INTRAVIT.,"I say it with a heavy heart,"
462,INTRAVIT.,I think you chose the better part.
463,INTRAVIT.,
464,INTRAVIT.,
465,INTRAVIT.,"For in man's dire perplexity,"
466,INTRAVIT.,The old and best philosophy
467,INTRAVIT.,Holds that a woodcock in the shop is
468,INTRAVIT.,"Well worth a couple in the coppice,"
469,INTRAVIT.,And tons of may-be bliss don't measure
470,INTRAVIT.,"One ounce of certain, solid pleasure."
471,INTRAVIT.,"Whence, once in Anchiale's city"
472,INTRAVIT.,Aristobulus found this witty
473,INTRAVIT.,"Inscription cut with wise intent,"
474,INTRAVIT.,"Upon an ancient monument,"

480,INTRAVIT.,"And so, my friends, though your adventure"

482,INTRAVIT.,Though curates and idealists
483,INTRAVIT.,"May call you 'rank materialists',"
484,INTRAVIT.,"And pompous atheistic prigs,"
485,INTRAVIT.,'Blind-worms' and 'Hedonistic pigs';
486,INTRAVIT.,"Though other men, and wise ones too,"
487,INTRAVIT.,May hold that there is more to do
488,INTRAVIT.,Than laugh and let the world go by
489,INTRAVIT.,"Saying ""To-morrow we shall die"";"
490,INTRAVIT.,Yet in a matter so obscure
491,INTRAVIT.,Wise men may differ to be sure.
492,INTRAVIT.,"Myself, I never thought it clever"
493,INTRAVIT.,"To fuss about the ""grand forever"","
494,INTRAVIT.,And cultivate a soul with care for
495,INTRAVIT.,That vast but vague hereafter; wherefore
