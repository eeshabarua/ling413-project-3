523,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,
524,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,The age commonly called Victorian came to an end about 1885. It was an
525,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,age distinguished by many true idealists and many false ideals. It
526,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"was, in spite of its notable artists, on an entirely different level"
527,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"from the epoch which had preceded it. Its poetry was, in the main, not"
528,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,universal but parochial; its romanticism was gilt and tinsel; its
529,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"realism was as cheap as its showy glass pendants, red plush, parlor"
530,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,chromos and antimacassars. The period was full of a pessimistic
531,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,resignation (the note popularized by Fitzgerald's Omar Khayy√°m) and a
532,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"kind of cowardice or at least a negation which, refusing to see any"
533,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"glamour in the actual world, turned to the Middle Ages, King Arthur,"
534,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,the legend of Troy--to the suave surroundings of a dream-world instead
535,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,of the hard contours of actual experience.
536,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,
537,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"At its worst, it was a period of smugness, of placid and pious"
538,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,sentimentality--epitomized by the rhymed sermons of Martin Farquhar
539,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"Tupper, whose _Proverbial Philosophy_ was devoured with all its"
540,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,cloying and indigestible sweetmeats by thousands. The same tendency is
541,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"apparent, though far less objectionably, in the moralizing lays of"
542,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"Lord Thomas Macaulay, in the theatrically emotionalized verses of"
543,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"Robert Buchanan, Edwin Arnold and Sir Lewis Morris--even in the lesser"
544,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,later work of Alfred Tennyson.
545,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,
546,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"And, without Tupper's emptiness or absurdities, the outworn platitudes"
547,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"again find their constant lover in Alfred Austin, Tennyson's successor"
548,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"as poet laureate. Austin brought the laureateship, which had been held"
549,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"by poets like Ben Jonson, Dryden, Southey and Wordsworth, to an"
550,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,incredibly low level; he took the thinning stream of garrulous poetic
551,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"conventionality, reduced it to the merest trickle--and diluted it."
552,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,
553,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,The poets of a generation before this time were fired with such ideas
554,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"as freedom, a deep and burning awe of nature, an insatiable hunger for"
555,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,truth in all its forms and manifestations. The characteristic poets of
556,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"the Victorian Era, says Max Plowman, ""wrote under the dominance of"
557,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"churchliness, of 'sweetness and light,' and a thousand lesser theories"
558,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"that have not truth but comfort for their end."""
559,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,
560,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,The revolt against this and the tawdriness of the period had already
561,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,begun; the best of Victorianism can be found not in men who were
562,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"typically Victorian, but in pioneers like Browning and writers like"
563,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"Swinburne, Rossetti, William Morris, who were completely out of"
564,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,sympathy with their time.
565,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,
566,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,But it was Oscar Wilde who led the men of the now famous 'nineties
567,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"toward an √¶sthetic freedom, to champion a beauty whose existence was"
568,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"its ""own excuse for being."" Wilde's was, in the most outspoken manner,"
569,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,the first use of √¶stheticism as a slogan; the battle-cry of the group
570,THE END OF VICTORIANISM,"was actually the now outworn but then revolutionary ""Art for Art's"

580,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,mainly suggested and influenced by the French. The group of

592,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,more than attentive to every phase of literary experimentation. The
593,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,last decade of the nineteenth century was so tolerant of novelty in

603,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,into a half-hearted defense of artificialities.

608,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,"an extravaganza of extravagance. ""The period"" (I am again quoting"

613,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,The eroticism which became so prevalent in the verse of many of the
614,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,younger poets was minor because it was little more than a pose--not
615,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,because it was erotic.... It was a passing mood which gave the poetry

618,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,
619,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,But most of the elegant and disillusioned young men overshot their
620,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,mark. Mere health reasserted itself; an inherent repressed vitality
621,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,"sought new channels. Arthur Symons deserted his hectic Muse, Richard"
622,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,"Le Gallienne abandoned his preciosity, and the group began to"
623,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,disintegrate. The √¶sthetic philosophy was wearing thin; it had already
624,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,begun to fray and reveal its essential shabbiness. Wilde himself
625,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,possessed the three things which he said the English would never
626,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,"forgive--youth, power and enthusiasm. But in trying to make an"
627,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,"exclusive cult of beauty, Wilde had also tried to make it evade"
628,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,"actuality; he urged that art should not, in any sense, be a part of"
629,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,"life but an escape from it. ""The proper school to learn art in is not"
630,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,"Life--but Art."" And in the same essay (""The Decay of Lying"") he wrote,"
631,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,"""All bad Art comes from returning to Life and Nature, and elevating"
632,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,"them into ideals."" Elsewhere he said, ""The first duty in life is to be"

635,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,
636,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,Such a cynical and decadent philosophy could not go unchallenged. Its
637,THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE √ÜSTHETIC PHILOSOPHY,aristocratic blue-bloodedness was bound to arouse the red blood of

643,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,
644,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,Henley repudiated this languid √¶stheticism; he scorned a negative art
645,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,which was out of touch with the world. His was a large and sweeping
646,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,affirmation. He felt that mere existence was glorious; life was
647,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,"coarse, difficult, often dangerous and dirty, but splendid at the"
648,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,"heart. Art, he knew, could not be separated from the dreams and"
649,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,hungers of man; it could not flourish only on its own essences or
650,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,"technical accomplishments. To live, poetry would have to share the"
651,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,"fears, angers, hopes and struggles of the prosaic world. And so Henley"
652,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,came like a swift salt breeze blowing through a perfumed and
653,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,heavily-screened studio. He sang loudly (sometimes even too loudly) of
654,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,"the joy of living and the courage of the ""unconquerable soul."" He was"
655,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,a powerful influence not only as a poet but as a critic and editor. In
656,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,the latter capacity he gathered about him such men as Robert Louis
657,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,"Stevenson, Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy, H. G. Wells, W. B. Yeats, T."
658,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,"E. Brown, J. M. Barrie. None of these men were his disciples, but none"
659,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,of them came into contact with him without being influenced in some
660,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,way by his sharp and positive personality. A pioneer and something of
661,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,"a prophet, he was one of the first to champion the paintings of"
662,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,Whistler and to proclaim the genius of the sculptor Rodin.
663,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,
664,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,"If at times Henley's verse is imperialistic, over-muscular and"

666,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,lyrics but by his passionate enthusiasm for nobility in whatever cause
667,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,it was joined. He never disdained the actual world in any of its
668,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,"moods--bus-drivers, hospital interiors, scrubwomen, a panting train,"
669,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,"the squalor of London's alleys, all found a voice in his lines--and"
670,WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY,his later work contains more than a hint of the delight in science and

697,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"Revival reached its height with John Millington Synge, who was not"
698,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"only the greatest dramatist of the Irish Theatre, but (to quote such"
699,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"contrary critics as George Moore and Harold Williams) ""one of the"
700,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"greatest dramatists who has written in English."" Synge's poetry,"
701,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"brusque and all too small in quantity, was a minor occupation with him"
702,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,and yet the quality and power of it is unmistakable. Its content is
703,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,never great but the raw vigor in it was to serve as a bold banner--a
704,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,sort of a brilliant Jolly Roger--for the younger men of the following
705,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,period. It was not only this dramatist's brief verses and his
706,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,intensely musical prose but his sharp prefaces that were to exercise
707,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,such an influence.
708,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,
709,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"In the notable introduction to the _Playboy of the Western World_,"
710,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"Synge declared, ""When I was writing _The Shadow of the Glen_ some"
711,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"years ago, I got more aid than any learning could have given me from a"
712,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"chink in the floor of the old Wicklow house where I was staying, that"
713,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,let me hear what was being said by the servant girls in the kitchen.
714,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"This matter is, I think, of some importance; for in countries where"
715,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"the imagination of the people, and the language they use, is rich and"
716,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"living, it is possible for a writer to be rich and copious in his"
717,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,words--and at the same time to give the reality which is at the root
718,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"of all poetry, in a natural and comprehensive form."" This quotation"
719,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"explains his idiom, possibly the sharpest-flavored and most vivid in"
720,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,modern literature.
721,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,
722,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"As to Synge's poetic power, it is unquestionably greatest in his"
723,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"plays. In _The Well of the Saints_, _The Playboy of the Western World_"
724,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"and _Riders to the Sea_ there are more poignance, beauty of form and"
725,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,richness of language than in any piece of dramatic writing since
726,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"Elizabethan times. Yeats, when he first heard Synge's early one-act"
727,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"play, _The Shadow of the Glen_, is said to have exclaimed ""Euripides."""
728,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"A half year later when Synge read him _Riders to the Sea_, Yeats again"
729,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"confined his enthusiasm to a single word:--""√Üschylus!"" Years have"
730,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,shown that Yeats's appreciation was not as exaggerated as many might
731,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,suppose.
732,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,
733,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"But although Synge's poetry was not his major concern, numbering only"
734,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"twenty-four original pieces and eighteen translations, it had a"
735,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"surprising effect upon his followers. It marked a point of departure,"
736,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,a reaction against both the too-polished and over-rhetorical verse of
737,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,his immediate predecessors and the dehumanized mysticism of many of
738,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,his associates. In that memorable preface to his _Poems_ he wrote what
739,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"was a slogan, a manifesto and at the same time a classic _credo_ for"
740,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"all that we call the ""new"" poetry. ""I have often thought,"" it begins,"
741,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"""that at the side of poetic diction, which everyone condemns, modern"
742,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"verse contains a great deal of poetic material, using 'poetic' in the"
743,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,same special sense. The poetry of exaltation will be always the
744,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,highest; but when men lose their poetic feeling for ordinary life and
745,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"cannot write poetry of ordinary things, their exalted poetry is likely"
746,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,to lose its strength of exaltation in the way that men cease to build
747,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,beautiful churches when they have lost happiness in building shops....
748,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,Even if we grant that exalted poetry can be kept successfully by
749,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"itself, the strong things of life are needed in poetry also, to show"
750,THE CELTIC REVIVAL AND J. M. SYNGE,"that what is exalted or tender is not made by feeble blood."""

756,RUDYARD KIPLING,simultaneously in places and people where there has been no point of
757,RUDYARD KIPLING,contact. Even before Synge published his proofs of the keen poetry in
758,RUDYARD KIPLING,"everyday life, Kipling was illuminating, in a totally different"
759,RUDYARD KIPLING,"manner, the wealth of poetic material in things hitherto regarded as"
760,RUDYARD KIPLING,too commonplace for poetry. Before literary England had quite
761,RUDYARD KIPLING,recovered from its surfeit of Victorian priggishness and
762,RUDYARD KIPLING,"pre-Raphaelite delicacy, Kipling came along with high spirits and a"
763,RUDYARD KIPLING,"great tide of life, sweeping all before him. An obscure Anglo-Indian"
764,RUDYARD KIPLING,"journalist, the publication of his _Barrack-room Ballads_ in 1892"
765,RUDYARD KIPLING,brought him sudden notice. By 1895 he was internationally famous.
766,RUDYARD KIPLING,"Brushing over the pallid attempts to revive a pallid past, he rode"
767,RUDYARD KIPLING,triumphantly on a wave of buoyant and sometimes brutal joy in the
768,RUDYARD KIPLING,present. Kipling gloried in the material world; he did more--he
769,RUDYARD KIPLING,glorified it. He pierced the coarse exteriors of seemingly prosaic
770,RUDYARD KIPLING,"things--things like machinery, bridge-building, cockney soldiers,"
771,RUDYARD KIPLING,"slang, steam, the dirty by-products of science (witness ""M'Andrews"

786,RUDYARD KIPLING,his more facile poetry; he falls into a journalistic ease that tends
787,RUDYARD KIPLING,to turn into jingle; he is fond of a militaristic drum-banging that is
788,RUDYARD KIPLING,"as blatant as the insularity he condemns. But a burning, if sometimes"

811,JOHN MASEFIELD,"brutal."""
812,JOHN MASEFIELD,
813,JOHN MASEFIELD,Masefield brought back to poetry that mixture of beauty and brutality
814,JOHN MASEFIELD,which is its most human and enduring quality. He brought back that
815,JOHN MASEFIELD,rich and almost vulgar vividness which is the very life-blood of
816,JOHN MASEFIELD,"Chaucer, of Shakespeare, of Burns, of Villon, of Heine--and of all"
817,JOHN MASEFIELD,those who were not only great artists but great humanists. As a purely
818,JOHN MASEFIELD,"descriptive poet, he can take his place with the masters of sea and"
819,JOHN MASEFIELD,"landscape. As an imaginative realist, he showed those who were"
820,JOHN MASEFIELD,"stumbling from one wild eccentricity to another to thrill them, that"
821,JOHN MASEFIELD,"they themselves were wilder, stranger, far more thrilling than"
822,JOHN MASEFIELD,anything in the world--or out of it. Few things in contemporary poetry
823,JOHN MASEFIELD,are as powerful as the regeneration of Saul Kane (in _The Everlasting
824,JOHN MASEFIELD,"Mercy_) or the story of _Dauber_, the tale of a tragic sea-voyage and"
825,JOHN MASEFIELD,a dreaming youth who wanted to be a painter. The vigorous description
826,JOHN MASEFIELD,"of rounding Cape Horn in the latter poem is superbly done, a"
827,JOHN MASEFIELD,"masterpiece in itself. Masefield's later volumes are quieter in tone,"
828,JOHN MASEFIELD,more measured in technique; there is an almost religious ring to many
829,JOHN MASEFIELD,"of his Shakespearian sonnets. But the swinging surge is there, a"

1015,THE MAN HE KILLED,Robert Bridges was born in 1844 and educated at Eton and Corpus
1016,THE MAN HE KILLED,"Christi College, Oxford. After traveling extensively, he studied"
1017,THE MAN HE KILLED,"medicine in London and practiced until 1882. Most of his poems, like"
1018,THE MAN HE KILLED,"his occasional plays, are classical in tone as well as treatment. He"
1019,THE MAN HE KILLED,"was appointed poet laureate in 1913, following Alfred Austin. His"
1020,THE MAN HE KILLED,command of the secrets of rhythm and a subtle versification give his
1021,THE MAN HE KILLED,lines a firm delicacy and beauty of pattern.

1137,ODE,_William Ernest Henley_
1138,ODE,
1139,ODE,
1140,ODE,William Ernest Henley was born in 1849 and was educated at the Grammar
1141,ODE,School of Gloucester. From childhood he was afflicted with a
1142,ODE,tuberculous disease which finally necessitated the amputation of a
1143,ODE,"foot. His _Hospital Verses_, those vivid precursors of current free"
1144,ODE,"verse, were a record of the time when he was at the infirmary at"
1145,ODE,"Edinburgh; they are sharp with the sights, sensations, even the actual"
1146,ODE,"smells of the sickroom. In spite (or, more probably, because) of his"
1147,ODE,"continued poor health, Henley never ceased to worship strength and"
1148,ODE,energy; courage and a triumphant belief in a harsh world shine out of
1149,ODE,the athletic _London Voluntaries_ (1892) and the lightest and most
1150,ODE,musical lyrics in _Hawthorn and Lavender_ (1898).
1151,ODE,
1152,ODE,The bulk of Henley's poetry is not great in volume. He has himself
1153,ODE,"explained the small quantity of his work in a Preface to his _Poems_,"
1154,ODE,"first published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1898. ""A principal"
1155,ODE,"reason,"" he says, ""is that, after spending the better part of my life"
1156,ODE,"in the pursuit of poetry, I found myself (about 1877) so utterly"
1157,ODE,"unmarketable that I had to own myself beaten in art, and to indict"
1158,ODE,"myself to journalism for the next ten years."" Later on, he began to"
1159,ODE,"write again--""old dusty sheaves were dragged to light; the work of"
1160,ODE,"selection and correction was begun; I burned much; I found that,"
1161,ODE,"after all, the lyrical instinct had slept--not died."""
1162,ODE,
1163,ODE,"After a brilliant and varied career (see Preface), devoted mostly to"
1164,ODE,"journalism, Henley died in 1903."

1267,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,
1268,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,
1269,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,Robert Louis Stevenson was born at Edinburgh in 1850. He was at first
1270,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,"trained to be a lighthouse engineer, following the profession of his"
1271,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,"family. However, he studied law instead; was admitted to the bar in"
1272,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,1875; and abandoned law for literature a few years later.
1273,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,
1274,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,"Though primarily a novelist, Stevenson has left one immortal book of"
1275,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,poetry which is equally at home in the nursery and the library: _A
1276,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,Child's Garden of Verses_ (first published in 1885) is second only to
1277,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,Mother Goose's own collection in its lyrical simplicity and universal
1278,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,appeal. _Underwoods_ (1887) and _Ballads_ (1890) comprise his entire
1279,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,"poetic output. As a genial essayist, he is not unworthy to be ranked"
1280,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,"with Charles Lamb. As a romancer, his fame rests securely on"
1281,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,"_Kidnapped_, the unfinished masterpiece, _Weir of Hermiston_, and that"
1282,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,"eternal classic of youth, _Treasure Island_."
1283,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,
1284,MARGARIT√Ü SORORI,"Stevenson died after a long and dogged fight with his illness, in the"

1432,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,"William Sharp was born at Garthland Place, Scotland, in 1855. He wrote"
1433,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,"several volumes of biography and criticism, published a book of plays"
1434,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,"greatly influenced by Maeterlinck (_Vistas_) and was editor of ""The"
1435,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,"Canterbury Poets"" series."
1436,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,
1437,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,"His feminine _alter ego_, Fiona Macleod, was a far different"
1438,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,personality. Sharp actually believed himself possessed of another
1439,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,"spirit; under the spell of this other self, he wrote several volumes"
1440,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,"of Celtic tales, beautiful tragic romances and no little unusual"
1441,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,"poetry. Of the prose stories written by Fiona Macleod, the most"
1442,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,barbaric and vivid are those collected in _The Sin-Eater and Other
1443,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,"Tales_; the longer _Pharais, A Romance of the Isles_, is scarcely less"
1444,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,unique.
1445,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,
1446,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,"In the ten years, 1882-1891, William Sharp published four volumes of"
1447,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,rather undistinguished verse. In 1896 _From the Hills of Dream_
1448,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,"appeared over the signature of Fiona Macleod; _The Hour of Beauty_, an"
1449,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,"even more distinctive collection, followed shortly. Both poetry and"
1450,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,prose were always the result of two sharply differentiated moods
1451,A THRUSH BEFORE DAWN,"constantly fluctuating; the emotional mood was that of Fiona Macleod,"

1504,THE VISION,undergraduate at Oxford he was marked for a brilliant career. When he
1505,THE VISION,"was a trifle over 21 years of age, he won the Newdigate Prize with his"
1506,THE VISION,poem _Ravenna_.
1507,THE VISION,
1508,THE VISION,"Giving himself almost entirely to prose, he speedily became known as a"
1509,THE VISION,writer of brilliant epigrammatic essays and even more brilliant
1510,THE VISION,paradoxical plays such as _An Ideal Husband_ and _The Importance of
1511,THE VISION,Being Earnest_. His aphorisms and flippancies were quoted everywhere;
1512,THE VISION,his fame as a wit was only surpassed by his notoriety as an √¶sthete.
1513,THE VISION,(See Preface.)
1514,THE VISION,
1515,THE VISION,"Most of his poems in prose (such as _The Happy Prince_, _The Birthday"
1516,THE VISION,of the Infanta_ and _The Fisherman and His Soul_) are more imaginative
1517,THE VISION,"and richly colored than his verse; but in one long poem, _The Ballad"
1518,THE VISION,"of Reading Gaol_ (1898), he sounded his deepest, simplest and most"
1519,THE VISION,"enduring note. Prison was, in many ways, a regeneration for Wilde. It"
1520,THE VISION,not only produced _The Ballad of Reading Gaol_ but made possible his
1521,THE VISION,"most poignant piece of writing, _De Profundis_, only a small part of"
1522,THE VISION,"which has been published. _Salom√©_, which has made the author's name a"
1523,THE VISION,"household word, was originally written in French in 1892 and later"
1524,THE VISION,"translated into English by Lord Alfred Douglas, accompanied by the"
1525,THE VISION,famous illustrations by Aubrey Beardsley. More recently this heated
1526,THE VISION,"drama, based on the story of Herod and Herodias, was made into an"
1527,THE VISION,opera by Richard Strauss.
1528,THE VISION,
1529,THE VISION,"Wilde's society plays, flashing and cynical, were the forerunners of"
1530,THE VISION,Bernard Shaw's audacious and far more searching ironies. One sees the
1531,THE VISION,"origin of a whole school of drama in such epigrams as ""The history of"
1532,THE VISION,woman is the history of the worst form of tyranny the world has ever
1533,THE VISION,known: the tyranny of the weak over the strong. It is the only tyranny

1703,A BALLAD OF HELL,How long she stayed I cannot tell;
1704,A BALLAD OF HELL,"But when she felt his perfidy,"

1706,A BALLAD OF HELL,And all the damned stood up to see.
1707,A BALLAD OF HELL,
1708,A BALLAD OF HELL,The devil stopped her at the brink:
1709,A BALLAD OF HELL,"She shook him off; she cried, 'Away!'"

1711,A BALLAD OF HELL,'I was betrayed: I will not stay.'

1718,A BALLAD OF HELL,To her it seemed a meadow fair;

1720,A BALLAD OF HELL,She entered heaven; she climbed the stair
1721,A BALLAD OF HELL,And knelt down at the mercy-seat.
1722,A BALLAD OF HELL,
1723,A BALLAD OF HELL,Seraphs and saints with one great voice

1764,IMAGINATION,"William Watson was born at Burley-in-Wharfedale, Yorkshire, August 2,"
1765,IMAGINATION,1858. He achieved his first wide success through his long and eloquent
1766,IMAGINATION,"poems on Wordsworth, Shelley, and Tennyson--poems that attempted, and"
1767,IMAGINATION,"sometimes successfully, to combine the manners of these masters. _The"

2613,MODERN BEAUTY,his best one-act dramas with the exception of his unforgettable _The

2617,MODERN BEAUTY,Others who followed Yeats have intensified the Irish drama; they have
2618,MODERN BEAUTY,"established a closer contact between the peasant and poet. No one,"
2619,MODERN BEAUTY,"however, has had so great a part in the shaping of modern drama in"
2620,MODERN BEAUTY,"Ireland as Yeats. His _Deirdre_ (1907), a beautiful retelling of the"
2621,MODERN BEAUTY,"great Gaelic legend, is far more dramatic than the earlier plays; it"
2622,MODERN BEAUTY,is particularly interesting to read with Synge's more idiomatic play
2623,MODERN BEAUTY,"on the same theme, _Deirdre of the Sorrows_."

2725,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,
2726,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,
2727,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"Born at Bombay, India, December 30, 1865, Rudyard Kipling, the author"
2728,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"of a dozen contemporary classics, was educated in England. He"
2729,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"returned, however, to India and took a position on the staff of ""The"
2730,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"Lahore Civil and Military Gazette,"" writing for the Indian press until"
2731,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"about 1890, when he went to England, where he has lived ever since,"
2732,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,with the exception of a short sojourn in America.
2733,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,
2734,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,Even while he was still in India he achieved a popular as well as a
2735,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"literary success with his dramatic and skilful tales, sketches and"
2736,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,ballads of Anglo-Indian life.
2737,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,
2738,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,_Soldiers Three_ (1888) was the first of six collections of short
2739,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"stories brought out in ""Wheeler's Railway Library."" They were followed"
2740,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"by the far more sensitive and searching _Plain Tales from the Hills_,"
2741,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"_Under the Deodars_ and _The Phantom 'Rikshaw_, which contains two of"
2742,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,the best and most convincing ghost-stories in recent literature.
2743,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,
2744,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"These tales, however, display only one side of Kipling's extraordinary"
2745,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"talents. As a writer of children's stories, he has few living equals."
2746,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"_Wee Willie Winkie_, which contains that stirring and heroic fragment"
2747,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"""Drums of the Fore and Aft,"" is only a trifle less notable than his"
2748,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,more obviously juvenile collections. _Just-So Stories_ and the two
2749,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,_Jungle Books_ (prose interspersed with lively rhymes) are classics
2750,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"for young people of all ages. _Kim_, the novel of a super-Mowgli grown"
2751,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"up, is a more mature masterpiece."
2752,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,
2753,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,Considered solely as a poet (see Preface) he is one of the most
2754,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,vigorous and unique figures of his time. The spirit of romance surges
2755,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,under his realities. His brisk lines conjure up the tang of a
2756,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"countryside in autumn, the tingle of salt spray, the rude sentiment of"
2757,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"ruder natures, the snapping of a banner, the lurch and rumble of the"
2758,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,sea. His poetry is woven of the stuff of myths; but it never loses its
2759,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"hold on actualities. Kipling himself in his poem ""The Benefactors"""
2760,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,(from _The Years Between_ [1919]) writes:
2761,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,
2762,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,Ah! What avails the classic bent
2763,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"And what the cultured word,"
2764,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,Against the undoctored incident
2765,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,That actually occurred?
2766,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,
2767,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,Kipling won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907. His varied poems
2768,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,have finally been collected in a remarkable one-volume _Inclusive
2769,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"Edition_ (1885-1918), an indispensable part of any student's library."
2770,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,"This gifted and prolific creator, whose work was affected by the war,"
2771,AN OLD SONG RESUNG,has frequently lapsed into bombast and a journalistic imperialism. At

3210,REGRET,and his poetry is a faithful reflection of his studies in Greek and
3211,REGRET,Latin literatures. Though he allied himself with the modern Irish
3212,REGRET,"poets, his Celtic origin is a literary myth; Johnson, having been"
3213,REGRET,"converted to Catholicism in 1891, became imbued with Catholic and,"
3214,REGRET,"later, with Irish traditions. His verse, while sometimes strained and"
3215,REGRET,"over-decorated, is chastely designed, rich and, like that of the"
3216,REGRET,"Cavalier poets of the seventeenth century, mystically devotional."

3294,TO A TRAVELLER,_Ernest Dowson_
3295,TO A TRAVELLER,
3296,TO A TRAVELLER,
3297,TO A TRAVELLER,Ernest Dowson was born at Belmont Hill in Kent in 1867. His
3298,TO A TRAVELLER,"great-uncle was Alfred Domett (Browning's ""Waring""), who was at one"
3299,TO A TRAVELLER,"time Prime Minister of New Zealand. Dowson, practically an invalid all"
3300,TO A TRAVELLER,"his life, was reckless with himself and, as disease weakened him more"
3301,TO A TRAVELLER,"and more, hid himself in miserable surroundings; for almost two years"
3302,TO A TRAVELLER,"he lived in sordid supper-houses known as ""cabmen's shelters."" He"
3303,TO A TRAVELLER,literally drank himself to death.
3304,TO A TRAVELLER,
3305,TO A TRAVELLER,His delicate and fantastic poetry was an attempt to escape from a
3306,TO A TRAVELLER,"reality too big and brutal for him. His passionate lyric, ""I have been"
3307,TO A TRAVELLER,"faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion,"" a triumph of despair and"
3308,TO A TRAVELLER,"disillusion, is an outburst in which Dowson epitomized himself--""One"
3309,TO A TRAVELLER,"of the greatest lyrical poems of our time,"" writes Arthur Symons, ""in"
3310,TO A TRAVELLER,"it he has for once said everything, and he has said it to an"
3311,TO A TRAVELLER,"intoxicating and perhaps immortal music."""
3312,TO A TRAVELLER,
3313,TO A TRAVELLER,"Dowson died obscure in 1900, one of the finest of modern minor poets."
3314,TO A TRAVELLER,His life was the tragedy of a weak nature buffeted by a strong and
3315,TO A TRAVELLER,merciless environment.

3636,SILENCE SINGS,_William H. Davies_
3637,SILENCE SINGS,
3638,SILENCE SINGS,
3639,SILENCE SINGS,"According to his own biography, William H. Davies was born in a"
3640,SILENCE SINGS,"public-house called Church House at Newport, in the County of"
3641,SILENCE SINGS,"Monmouthshire, April 20, 1870, of Welsh parents. He was, until Bernard"
3642,SILENCE SINGS,"Shaw ""discovered"" him, a cattleman, a berry-picker, a panhandler--in"
3643,SILENCE SINGS,"short, a vagabond. In a preface to Davies' second book, _The"
3644,SILENCE SINGS,"Autobiography of a Super-Tramp_ (1906), Shaw describes how the"
3645,SILENCE SINGS,manuscript came into his hands:
3646,SILENCE SINGS,
3647,SILENCE SINGS,"""In the year 1905 I received by post a volume of poems by one William"
3648,SILENCE SINGS,"H. Davies, whose address was The Farm House, Kensington, S. E. I was"
3649,SILENCE SINGS,surprised to learn that there was still a farmhouse left in
3650,SILENCE SINGS,"Kensington; for I did not then suspect that the Farm House, like the"
3651,SILENCE SINGS,Shepherdess Walks and Nightingale Lane and Whetstone Parks of Bethnal
3652,SILENCE SINGS,"Green and Holborn, is so called nowadays in irony, and is, in fact, a"
3653,SILENCE SINGS,"doss-house, or hostelry, where single men can have a night's lodging,"
3654,SILENCE SINGS,"for, at most, sixpence.... The author, as far as I could guess, had"
3655,SILENCE SINGS,walked into a printer's or stationer's shop; handed in his manuscript;
3656,SILENCE SINGS,and ordered his book as he might have ordered a pair of boots. It was
3657,SILENCE SINGS,"marked 'price, half a crown.' An accompanying letter asked me very"
3658,SILENCE SINGS,"civilly if I required a half-crown book of verses; and if so, would I"
3659,SILENCE SINGS,"please send the author the half crown: if not, would I return the"
3660,SILENCE SINGS,"book. This was attractively simple and sensible. I opened the book,"
3661,SILENCE SINGS,and was more puzzled than ever; for before I had read three lines I
3662,SILENCE SINGS,perceived that the author was a real poet. His work was not in the
3663,SILENCE SINGS,least strenuous or modern; there was indeed no sign of his ever having
3664,SILENCE SINGS,"read anything otherwise than as a child reads.... Here, I saw, was a"
3665,SILENCE SINGS,"genuine innocent, writing odds and ends of verse about odds and ends"
3666,SILENCE SINGS,of things; living quite out of the world in which such things are
3667,SILENCE SINGS,"usually done, and knowing no better (or rather no worse) than to get"
3668,SILENCE SINGS,his book made by the appropriate craftsman and hawk it round like any
3669,SILENCE SINGS,"other ware."""
3670,SILENCE SINGS,
3671,SILENCE SINGS,It is more than likely that Davies' first notoriety as a tramp-poet
3672,SILENCE SINGS,who had ridden the rails in the United States and had had his right
3673,SILENCE SINGS,"foot cut off by a train in Canada, obscured his merits as a genuine"
3674,SILENCE SINGS,singer. Even his early _The Soul's Destroyer_ (1907) revealed that
3675,SILENCE SINGS,simplicity which is as _na√Øf_ as it is strange. The volumes that
3676,SILENCE SINGS,"followed are more clearly melodious, more like the visionary wonder of"
3677,SILENCE SINGS,"Blake, more artistically artless."

3755,THE EXAMPLE,
3756,THE EXAMPLE,"Hilaire Belloc, who has been described as ""a Frenchman, an Englishman,"
3757,THE EXAMPLE,"an Oxford man, a country gentleman, a soldier, a satirist, a democrat,"
3758,THE EXAMPLE,"a novelist, and a practical journalist,"" was born July 27, 1870. After"
3759,THE EXAMPLE,leaving school he served as a driver in the 8th Regiment of French
3760,THE EXAMPLE,"Artillery at Toul Meurthe-et-Moselle, being at that time a French"
3761,THE EXAMPLE,"citizen. He was naturalized as a British subject somewhat later, and"
3762,THE EXAMPLE,in 1906 he entered the House of Commons as Liberal Member for South
3763,THE EXAMPLE,Salford.
3764,THE EXAMPLE,
3765,THE EXAMPLE,"As an author, he has engaged in multiple activities. He has written"
3766,THE EXAMPLE,"three satirical novels, one of which, _Mr. Clutterbuck's Election_,"
3767,THE EXAMPLE,sharply exposes British newspapers and underground politics. His _Path
3768,THE EXAMPLE,to Rome_ (1902) is a high-spirited and ever-delightful travel book
3769,THE EXAMPLE,which has passed through many editions. His historical studies and
3770,THE EXAMPLE,biographies of _Robespierre_ and _Marie Antoinette_ (1909) are
3771,THE EXAMPLE,classics of their kind. As a poet he is only somewhat less engaging.
3772,THE EXAMPLE,His _Verses_ (1910) is a rather brief collection of poems on a wide
3773,THE EXAMPLE,variety of themes. Although his humorous and burlesque stanzas are
3774,THE EXAMPLE,"refreshing, Belloc is most himself when he writes either of malt"
3775,THE EXAMPLE,liquor or his beloved Sussex. Though his religious poems are full of a
3776,THE EXAMPLE,"fine romanticism, ""The South Country"" is the most pictorial and"
3777,THE EXAMPLE,persuasive of his serious poems. His poetic as well as his spiritual
3778,THE EXAMPLE,kinship with G. K. Chesterton is obvious.

3793,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"That I could wish to be,"
3794,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the men that were boys when I was a boy
3795,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Walking along with me.

3808,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"They have the secret of the Rocks,"
3809,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the oldest kind of song.

3812,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"Are the kindest and most wise,"

3822,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Nor I never come on a belt of sand
3823,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,But my home is there.

3835,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Of the men of the Sussex Weald;
3836,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"They watch the stars from silent folds,"

3846,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the story of Sussex told.

3848,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,I will hold my house in the high wood
3849,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"Within a walk of the sea,"

3968,A RUSTIC SONG,"The most brilliant star of the Celtic revival was born at Rathfarnham,"
3969,A RUSTIC SONG,"near Dublin, in 1871. As a child in Wicklow, he was already fascinated"
3970,A RUSTIC SONG,"by the strange idioms and the rhythmic speech he heard there, a native"
3971,A RUSTIC SONG,utterance which was his greatest delight and which was to be rich
3972,A RUSTIC SONG,material for his greatest work. He did not use this folk-language
3973,A RUSTIC SONG,"merely as he heard it. He was an artist first and last, and as an"
3974,A RUSTIC SONG,"artist he bent and shaped the rough material, selecting with great"
3975,A RUSTIC SONG,"fastidiousness, so that in his plays every speech is, as he himself"
3976,A RUSTIC SONG,"declared all good speech should be, ""as fully flavored as a nut or"
3977,A RUSTIC SONG,"apple."" Even in _The Tinker's Wedding_ (1907), possibly the least"
3978,A RUSTIC SONG,"important of his plays, one is arrested by snatches like:"
3979,A RUSTIC SONG,
3980,A RUSTIC SONG,"""That's a sweet tongue you have, Sarah Casey; but if sleep's"
3981,A RUSTIC SONG,"a grand thing, it's a grand thing to be waking up a day the"

3986,A RUSTIC SONG,"For some time, Synge's career was uncertain. He went to Germany half"
3987,A RUSTIC SONG,intending to become a professional musician. There he studied the
3988,A RUSTIC SONG,"theory of music, perfecting himself meanwhile in Gaelic and Hebrew,"
3989,A RUSTIC SONG,winning prizes in both of these languages. Yeats found him in France
3990,A RUSTIC SONG,"in 1898 and advised him to go to the Aran Islands, to live there as if"
3991,A RUSTIC SONG,"he were one of the people. ""Express a life,"" said Yeats, ""that has"
3992,A RUSTIC SONG,"never found expression."" Synge went. He became part of the life of"
3993,A RUSTIC SONG,"Aran, living upon salt fish and eggs, talking Irish for the most part"
3994,A RUSTIC SONG,"but listening also to that beautiful English which, to quote Yeats"
3995,A RUSTIC SONG,"again, ""has grown up in Irish-speaking districts and takes its"
3996,A RUSTIC SONG,vocabulary from the time of Malory and of the translators of the
3997,A RUSTIC SONG,"Bible, but its idiom and vivid metaphor from Irish."" The result of"
3998,A RUSTIC SONG,this close contact was five of the greatest poetic prose dramas not

4004,A RUSTIC SONG,"imagery, a new language startling in its vigor, a wildness and passion"

4010,A RUSTIC SONG,"verses, but also Synge's theory of poetry. The translations, which"
4011,A RUSTIC SONG,"have been rendered in a highly intensified prose, are as racy as"
4012,A RUSTIC SONG,anything in his plays; his versions of Villon and Petrarch are

4542,NOD,_G. K. Chesterton_
4543,NOD,
4544,NOD,
4545,NOD,"This brilliant journalist, novelist, essayist, publicist and lyricist,"
4546,NOD,"Gilbert Keith Chesterton, was born at Campden Hill, Kensington, in"
4547,NOD,"1874, and began his literary life by reviewing books on art for"
4548,NOD,"various magazines. He is best known as a writer of flashing,"
4549,NOD,"paradoxical essays on anything and everything, like _Tremendous"
4550,NOD,"Trifles_ (1909), _Varied Types_ (1905), and _All Things Considered_"
4551,NOD,"(1910). But he is also a stimulating critic; a keen appraiser, as in"
4552,NOD,his volume _Heretics_ (1905) and his analytical studies of Robert
4553,NOD,"Browning, Charles Dickens, and George Bernard Shaw; a writer of"
4554,NOD,strange and grotesque romances like _The Napoleon of Notting Hill_
4555,NOD,"(1906), _The Man Who Was Thursday_ (1908), which Chesterton himself"
4556,NOD,"has subtitled ""A Nightmare,"" and _The Flying Inn_ (1914); the author"
4557,NOD,"of several books of fantastic short stories, ranging from the wildly"
4558,NOD,whimsical narratives in _The Club of Queer Trades_ (1905) to that
4559,NOD,amazing sequence _The Innocence of Father Brown_ (1911)--which is a
4560,NOD,series of religious detective stories!
4561,NOD,
4562,NOD,"Besides being the creator of all of these, Chesterton finds time to be"
4563,NOD,"a prolific if sometimes too acrobatic newspaperman, a lay preacher in"
4564,NOD,"disguise (witness _Orthodoxy_ [1908], _What's Wrong with the World?_"
4565,NOD,"[1910], _The Ball and the Cross_ [1909]), a pamphleteer, and a poet."
4566,NOD,"His first volume of verse, _The Wild Knight and Other Poems_ (1900), a"
4567,NOD,"collection of quaintly-flavored and affirmative verses, was followed"
4568,NOD,"by _The Ballad of the White Horse_ (1911), one long poem which, in"
4569,NOD,"spite of Chesterton's ever-present didactic sermonizing, is possibly"
4570,NOD,"the most stirring creation he has achieved. This poem has the swing,"
4571,NOD,"the vigor, the spontaneity, and, above all, the ageless simplicity of"
4572,NOD,the true narrative ballad.
4573,NOD,
4574,NOD,"Scarcely less notable is the ringing ""Lepanto"" from his later _Poems_"
4575,NOD,"(1915) which, anticipating the banging, clanging verses of Vachel"
4576,NOD,"Lindsay's ""The Congo,"" is one of the finest of modern chants. It is"
4577,NOD,"interesting to see how the syllables beat, as though on brass; it is"
4578,NOD,"thrilling to feel how, in one's pulses, the armies sing, the feet"
4579,NOD,"tramp, the drums snarl, and all the tides of marching crusaders roll"
4580,NOD,out of lines like:
4581,NOD,
4582,NOD,"""Strong gongs groaning as the guns boom far,"
4583,NOD,Don John of Austria is going to the war;
4584,NOD,Stiff flags straining in the night-blasts cold
4585,NOD,"In the gloom black-purple, in the glint old-gold;"
4586,NOD,"Torchlight crimson on the copper kettle-drums,"
4587,NOD,"Then the tuckets, then the trumpets, then the cannon, and he comes...."""
4588,NOD,
4589,NOD,"Chesterton, the prose-paradoxer, is a delightful product of a"
4590,NOD,skeptical age. But it is Chesterton the poet who is more likely to
4591,NOD,outlive it.

4598,LEPANTO[14],"There is laughter like the fountains in that face of all men feared,"
4599,LEPANTO[14],"It stirs the forest darkness, the darkness of his beard;"
4600,LEPANTO[14],"It curls the blood-red crescent, the crescent of his lips;"
4601,LEPANTO[14],For the inmost sea of all the earth is shaken with his ships.
4602,LEPANTO[14],"They have dared the white republics up the capes of Italy,"
4603,LEPANTO[14],"They have dashed the Adriatic round the Lion of the Sea,"
4604,LEPANTO[14],"And the Pope has cast his arms abroad for agony and loss,"
4605,LEPANTO[14],And called the kings of Christendom for swords about the Cross.
4606,LEPANTO[14],The cold queen of England is looking in the glass;

4634,LEPANTO[14],(_Don John of Austria is going to the war._)
4635,LEPANTO[14],"He moves a mighty turban on the timeless houri's knees,"
4636,LEPANTO[14],His turban that is woven of the sunsets and the seas.
4637,LEPANTO[14],"He shakes the peacock gardens as he rises from his ease,"
4638,LEPANTO[14],And he strides among the tree-tops and is taller than the trees;
4639,LEPANTO[14],And his voice through all the garden is a thunder sent to bring
4640,LEPANTO[14],Black Azrael and Ariel and Ammon on the wing.
4641,LEPANTO[14],"Giants and the Genii,"
4642,LEPANTO[14],"Multiplex of wing and eye,"
4643,LEPANTO[14],Whose strong obedience broke the sky

4645,LEPANTO[14],
4646,LEPANTO[14],"They rush in red and purple from the red clouds of the morn,"
4647,LEPANTO[14],From the temples where the yellow gods shut up their eyes in scorn;
4648,LEPANTO[14],They rise in green robes roaring from the green hells of the sea
4649,LEPANTO[14],"Where fallen skies and evil hues and eyeless creatures be,"
4650,LEPANTO[14],"On them the sea-valves cluster and the grey sea-forests curl,"
4651,LEPANTO[14],"Splashed with a splendid sickness, the sickness of the pearl;"
4652,LEPANTO[14],"They swell in sapphire smoke out of the blue cracks of the ground,--"
4653,LEPANTO[14],They gather and they wonder and give worship to Mahound.
4654,LEPANTO[14],"And he saith, ""Break up the mountains where the hermit-folk can hide,"
4655,LEPANTO[14],"And sift the red and silver sands lest bone of saint abide,"
4656,LEPANTO[14],"And chase the Giaours flying night and day, not giving rest,"
4657,LEPANTO[14],For that which was our trouble comes again out of the west.
4658,LEPANTO[14],"We have set the seal of Solomon on all things under sun,"
4659,LEPANTO[14],Of knowledge and of sorrow and endurance of things done.
4660,LEPANTO[14],"But a noise is in the mountains, in the mountains, and I know"
4661,LEPANTO[14],The voice that shook our palaces--four hundred years ago:
4662,LEPANTO[14],It is he that saith not 'Kismet'; it is he that knows not Fate;
4663,LEPANTO[14],"It is Richard, it is Raymond, it is Godfrey at the gate!"
4664,LEPANTO[14],"It is he whose loss is laughter when he counts the wager worth,"
4665,LEPANTO[14],"Put down your feet upon him, that our peace be on the earth."""

4675,LEPANTO[14],Where the grey seas glitter and the sharp tides shift
4676,LEPANTO[14],And the sea-folk labour and the red sails lift.
4677,LEPANTO[14],He shakes his lance of iron and he claps his wings of stone;
4678,LEPANTO[14],The noise is gone through Normandy; the noise is gone alone;
4679,LEPANTO[14],"The North is full of tangled things and texts and aching eyes,"
4680,LEPANTO[14],"And dead is all the innocence of anger and surprise,"
4681,LEPANTO[14],"And Christian killeth Christian in a narrow dusty room,"
4682,LEPANTO[14],"And Christian dreadeth Christ that hath a newer face of doom,"
4683,LEPANTO[14],"And Christian hateth Mary that God kissed in Galilee,--"
4684,LEPANTO[14],But Don John of Austria is riding to the sea.
4685,LEPANTO[14],Don John calling through the blast and the eclipse
4686,LEPANTO[14],"Crying with the trumpet, with the trumpet of his lips,"
4687,LEPANTO[14],Trumpet that sayeth _ha_!
4688,LEPANTO[14],_Domino gloria!_
4689,LEPANTO[14],Don John of Austria

4694,LEPANTO[14],"The walls are hung with velvet that is black and soft as sin,"
4695,LEPANTO[14],And little dwarfs creep out of it and little dwarfs creep in.
4696,LEPANTO[14],"He holds a crystal phial that has colours like the moon,"
4697,LEPANTO[14],"He touches, and it tingles, and he trembles very soon,"
4698,LEPANTO[14],And his face is as a fungus of a leprous white and grey
4699,LEPANTO[14],"Like plants in the high houses that are shuttered from the day,"
4700,LEPANTO[14],"And death is in the phial and the end of noble work,"
4701,LEPANTO[14],But Don John of Austria has fired upon the Turk.
4702,LEPANTO[14],"Don John's hunting, and his hounds have bayed--"
4703,LEPANTO[14],Booms away past Italy the rumour of his raid.
4704,LEPANTO[14],"Gun upon gun, ha! ha!"
4705,LEPANTO[14],"Gun upon gun, hurrah!"
4706,LEPANTO[14],Don John of Austria
4707,LEPANTO[14],Has loosed the cannonade.

4710,LEPANTO[14],(_Don John of Austria is hidden in the smoke._)
4711,LEPANTO[14],"The hidden room in man's house where God sits all the year,"
4712,LEPANTO[14],The secret window whence the world looks small and very dear.
4713,LEPANTO[14],He sees as in a mirror on the monstrous twilight sea
4714,LEPANTO[14],The crescent of his cruel ships whose name is mystery;
4715,LEPANTO[14],"They fling great shadows foe-wards, making Cross and Castle dark,"
4716,LEPANTO[14],They veil the plumed lions on the galleys of St. Mark;
4717,LEPANTO[14],"And above the ships are palaces of brown, black-bearded chiefs,"
4718,LEPANTO[14],"And below the ships are prisons, where with multitudinous griefs,"
4719,LEPANTO[14],"Christian captives sick and sunless, all a labouring race repines"
4720,LEPANTO[14],"Like a race in sunken cities, like a nation in the mines."
4721,LEPANTO[14],"They are lost like slaves that sweat, and in the skies of morning hung"
4722,LEPANTO[14],The stair-ways of the tallest gods when tyranny was young.
4723,LEPANTO[14],"They are countless, voiceless, hopeless as those fallen or fleeing on"
4724,LEPANTO[14],Before the high Kings' horses in the granite of Babylon.
4725,LEPANTO[14],And many a one grows witless in his quiet room in hell
4726,LEPANTO[14],"Where a yellow face looks inward through the lattice of his cell,"
4727,LEPANTO[14],"And he finds his God forgotten, and he seeks no more a sign--"

4730,LEPANTO[14],"Purpling all the ocean like a bloody pirate's sloop,"
4731,LEPANTO[14],"Scarlet running over on the silvers and the golds,"
4732,LEPANTO[14],"Breaking of the hatches up and bursting of the holds,"
4733,LEPANTO[14],Thronging of the thousands up that labour under sea
4734,LEPANTO[14],White for bliss and blind for sun and stunned for liberty.

4835,THE STONE[15],To set above his head?
4836,THE STONE[15],And will you cut a stone for him--
4837,THE STONE[15],"A stone for him?"" she said."
4838,THE STONE[15],
4839,THE STONE[15],"Three days before, a splintered rock"
4840,THE STONE[15],Had struck her lover dead--
4841,THE STONE[15],"Had struck him in the quarry dead,"
4842,THE STONE[15],"Where, careless of the warning call,"
4843,THE STONE[15],"He loitered, while the shot was fired--"
4844,THE STONE[15],"A lively stripling, brave and tall,"
4845,THE STONE[15],And sure of all his heart desired ...
4846,THE STONE[15],"A flash, a shock,"
4847,THE STONE[15],A rumbling fall ...
4848,THE STONE[15],"And, broken 'neath the broken rock,"
4849,THE STONE[15],"A lifeless heap, with face of clay;"
4850,THE STONE[15],"And still as any stone he lay,"
4851,THE STONE[15],With eyes that saw the end of all.
4852,THE STONE[15],
4853,THE STONE[15],I went to break the news to her;
4854,THE STONE[15],And I could hear my own heart beat
4855,THE STONE[15],With dread of what my lips might say
4856,THE STONE[15],"But, some poor fool had sped before;"
4857,THE STONE[15],"And flinging wide her father's door,"
4858,THE STONE[15],"Had blurted out the news to her,"
4859,THE STONE[15],"Had struck her lover dead for her,"
4860,THE STONE[15],"Had struck the girl's heart dead in her,"
4861,THE STONE[15],"Had struck life, lifeless, at a word,"
4862,THE STONE[15],And dropped it at her feet:
4863,THE STONE[15],"Then hurried on his witless way,"
4864,THE STONE[15],Scarce knowing she had heard.
4865,THE STONE[15],
4866,THE STONE[15],"And when I came, she stood, alone"
4867,THE STONE[15],"A woman, turned to stone:"
4868,THE STONE[15],"And, though no word at all she said,"
4869,THE STONE[15],I knew that all was known.
4870,THE STONE[15],
4871,THE STONE[15],"Because her heart was dead,"
4872,THE STONE[15],"She did not sigh nor moan,"
4873,THE STONE[15],His mother wept:
4874,THE STONE[15],She could not weep.
4875,THE STONE[15],Her lover slept:
4876,THE STONE[15],She could not sleep.
4877,THE STONE[15],"Three days, three nights,"
4878,THE STONE[15],She did not stir:
4879,THE STONE[15],"Three days, three nights,"
4880,THE STONE[15],"Were one to her,"
4881,THE STONE[15],Who never closed her eyes
4882,THE STONE[15],"From sunset to sunrise,"
4883,THE STONE[15],From dawn to evenfall:
4884,THE STONE[15],"Her tearless, staring eyes,"
4885,THE STONE[15],"That seeing naught, saw all."
4886,THE STONE[15],
4887,THE STONE[15],"The fourth night when I came from work,"
4888,THE STONE[15],I found her at my door.
4889,THE STONE[15],"""And will you cut a stone for him?"""
4890,THE STONE[15],She said: and spoke no more:
4891,THE STONE[15],"But followed me, as I went in,"
4892,THE STONE[15],And sank upon a chair;
4893,THE STONE[15],"And fixed her grey eyes on my face,"
4894,THE STONE[15],"With still, unseeing stare."
4895,THE STONE[15],"And, as she waited patiently,"
4896,THE STONE[15],I could not bear to feel
4897,THE STONE[15],"Those still, grey eyes that followed me,"
4898,THE STONE[15],"Those eyes that plucked the heart from me,"
4899,THE STONE[15],Those eyes that sucked the breath from me
4900,THE STONE[15],"And curdled the warm blood in me,"
4901,THE STONE[15],"Those eyes that cut me to the bone,"
4902,THE STONE[15],And pierced my marrow like cold steel.
4903,THE STONE[15],
4904,THE STONE[15],"And so I rose, and sought a stone;"
4905,THE STONE[15],"And cut it, smooth and square:"
4906,THE STONE[15],"And, as I worked, she sat and watched,"
4907,THE STONE[15],"Beside me, in her chair."
4908,THE STONE[15],"Night after night, by candlelight,"
4909,THE STONE[15],I cut her lover's name:
4910,THE STONE[15],"Night after night, so still and white,"
4911,THE STONE[15],And like a ghost she came;
4912,THE STONE[15],And sat beside me in her chair;
4913,THE STONE[15],And watched with eyes aflame.
4914,THE STONE[15],
4915,THE STONE[15],She eyed each stroke;
4916,THE STONE[15],And hardly stirred:
4917,THE STONE[15],She never spoke
4918,THE STONE[15],A single word:
4919,THE STONE[15],And not a sound or murmur broke
4920,THE STONE[15],"The quiet, save the mallet-stroke."
4921,THE STONE[15],
4922,THE STONE[15],"With still eyes ever on my hands,"
4923,THE STONE[15],"With eyes that seemed to burn my hands,"
4924,THE STONE[15],"My wincing, overwearied hands,"
4925,THE STONE[15],"She watched, with bloodless lips apart,"
4926,THE STONE[15],"And silent, indrawn breath:"
4927,THE STONE[15],"And every stroke my chisel cut,"
4928,THE STONE[15],Death cut still deeper in her heart:
4929,THE STONE[15],"The two of us were chiselling,"
4930,THE STONE[15],"Together, I and death."
4931,THE STONE[15],
4932,THE STONE[15],"And when at length the job was done,"
4933,THE STONE[15],"And I had laid the mallet by,"
4934,THE STONE[15],"As if, at last, her peace were won,"
4935,THE STONE[15],"She breathed his name; and, with a sigh,"
4936,THE STONE[15],Passed slowly through the open door:
4937,THE STONE[15],And never crossed my threshold more.
4938,THE STONE[15],
4939,THE STONE[15],"Next night I laboured late, alone,"
4940,THE STONE[15],To cut her name upon the stone.

4984,FOOTNOTES:,"possibly overemphasized passion and brutality but, underneath the"

4996,FOOTNOTES:,the portrayal of the mother alone in her cottage; the public-house

5326,III,
5327,III,
5328,III,"Edward Thomas, one of the little-known but most individual of modern"
5329,III,"English poets, was born in 1878. For many years before he turned to"
5330,III,"verse, Thomas had a large following as a critic and author of travel"
5331,III,"books, biographies, pot-boilers. Hating his hack-work, yet unable to"
5332,III,"get free of it, he had so repressed his creative ability that he had"
5333,III,grown doubtful concerning his own power. It needed something foreign
5334,III,"to stir and animate what was native in him. So when Robert Frost, the"
5335,III,"New England poet, went abroad in 1912 for two years and became an"
5336,III,"intimate of Thomas's, the English critic began to write poetry."
5337,III,"Loving, like Frost, the _minuti√¶_ of existence, the quaint and casual"
5338,III,"turn of ordinary life, he caught the magic of the English countryside"
5339,III,"in its unpoeticized quietude. Many of his poems are full of a slow,"
5340,III,sad contemplation of life and a reflection of its brave futility. It
5341,III,is not disillusion exactly; it is rather an absence of illusion.
5342,III,"_Poems_ (1917), dedicated to Robert Frost, is full of Thomas's"
5343,III,"fidelity to little things, things as unglorified as the unfreezing of"
5344,III,"the ""rock-like mud,"" a child's path, a list of quaint-sounding"
5345,III,"villages, birds' nests uncovered by the autumn wind, dusty"
5346,III,nettles--the lines glow with a deep and almost abject reverence for
5347,III,the soil.

5451,PRAISE,"most graceful of the younger word-magicians, Ralph Hodgson will retain"
5452,PRAISE,his freshness as long as there are lovers of such rare and timeless
5453,PRAISE,songs as his. It is difficult to think of any anthology of English
5454,PRAISE,"poetry compiled after 1917 that could omit ""Eve,"" ""The Song of Honor,"""
5455,PRAISE,"and that memorable snatch of music, ""Time, You Old Gypsy Man."" One"
5456,PRAISE,"succumbs to the charm of ""Eve"" at the first reading; for here is the"
5457,PRAISE,oldest of all legends told with a surprising simplicity and still more
5458,PRAISE,surprising freshness. This Eve is neither the conscious sinner nor the
5459,PRAISE,"Mother of men; she is, in Hodgson's candid lines, any young, English"

5623,THE MYSTERY,"in London in 1912, a unique establishment having as its object a"
5624,THE MYSTERY,"practical relation between poetry and the public, and keeping in stock"
5625,THE MYSTERY,"nothing but poetry, the drama, and books connected with these"
5626,THE MYSTERY,subjects. His quarterly _Poetry and Drama_ (discontinued during the

5651,THE NIGHTINGALE NEAR THE HOUSE,"As all night long I listen, and my brain"
5652,THE NIGHTINGALE NEAR THE HOUSE,Receives your song; then loses it again
5653,THE NIGHTINGALE NEAR THE HOUSE,In moonlight on the lawn.
5654,THE NIGHTINGALE NEAR THE HOUSE,
5655,THE NIGHTINGALE NEAR THE HOUSE,"Now is your voice a marble high and white,"
5656,THE NIGHTINGALE NEAR THE HOUSE,"Then like a mist on fields of paradise,"

5766,STRANGE MEETINGS,
5767,STRANGE MEETINGS,
5768,STRANGE MEETINGS,"Thomas M. Kettle was born at Artane County, Dublin, in 1880 and was"
5769,STRANGE MEETINGS,"educated at University College, where he won the Gold Medal for"
5770,STRANGE MEETINGS,Oratory. His extraordinary faculty for grasping an intricate problem
5771,STRANGE MEETINGS,"and crystallizing it in an epigram, or scoring his adversaries with"
5772,STRANGE MEETINGS,"one bright flash, was apparent even then. He was admitted to the bar"
5773,STRANGE MEETINGS,"in 1905 but soon abandoned the law to devote himself to journalism,"
5774,STRANGE MEETINGS,"which, because of his remarkable style, never remained journalism in"
5775,STRANGE MEETINGS,his hands. In 1906 he entered politics; in 1910 he was re-elected for
5776,STRANGE MEETINGS,East Tyrone. Even his bitterest opponents conceded that Tom Kettle (as
5777,STRANGE MEETINGS,he was called by friend and enemy) was the most honorable of fighters;
5778,STRANGE MEETINGS,"they acknowledged his honesty, courage and devotion to the cause of a"
5779,STRANGE MEETINGS,United Ireland--and respected his penetrating wit. He once spoke of a
5780,STRANGE MEETINGS,"Mr. Healy as ""a brilliant calamity"" and satirized a long-winded"
5781,STRANGE MEETINGS,"speaker by saying, ""Mr. Long knows a sentence should have a beginning,"
5782,STRANGE MEETINGS,"but he quite forgets it should also have an end."""
5783,STRANGE MEETINGS,
5784,STRANGE MEETINGS,"""An Irish torch-bearer"" (so E. B. Osborn calls him), Kettle fell in"
5785,STRANGE MEETINGS,"action at Ginchy, leading his Fusiliers in September, 1916. The"
5786,STRANGE MEETINGS,uplifted poem to his daughter was written shortly before his death.

5810,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",
5811,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",
5812,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD","Alfred Noyes was born at Staffordshire, September 16, 1880. He is one"
5813,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",of the few contemporary poets who have been fortunate enough to write
5814,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",a kind of poetry that is not only saleable but popular with many
5815,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",classes of people.
5816,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",
5817,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD","His first book, _The Loom of Years_ (1902), was published when he was"
5818,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD","only 22 years old, and _Poems_ (1904) intensified the promise of his"
5819,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD","first publication. Swinburne, grown old and living in retirement, was"
5820,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",so struck with Noyes's talent that he had the young poet out to read
5821,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD","to him. Unfortunately, Noyes has not developed his gifts as deeply as"
5822,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD","his admirers have hoped. His poetry, extremely straightforward and"
5823,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD","rhythmical, has often degenerated into cheap sentimentalities and"
5824,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",cheaper tirades; it has frequently attempted to express programs and
5825,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",profundities far beyond Noyes's power.
5826,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",
5827,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",What is most appealing about his best verse is its ease and
5828,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",heartiness; this singer's gift lies in the almost personal bond
5829,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",established between the poet and his public. People have such a good
5830,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",time reading his vivacious lines because Noyes had such a good time
5831,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",writing them. Rhyme in a thumping rhythm seems to be not merely his
5832,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",trade but his morning exercise. Noyes's own relish filled and
5833,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD","quickened glees and catches like _Forty Singing Seamen_ (1907), the"
5834,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD","lusty choruses in _Tales of the Mermaid Tavern_ (1913), and the"
5835,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",genuinely inspired nonsense of the earlier _Forest of Wild Thyme_
5836,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",(1905).
5837,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",
5838,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD","The least popular work of Noyes is, as a unified product, his most"
5839,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD","remarkable performance. It is an epic in twelve books of blank verse,"
5840,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD","_Drake_ (1908), a glowing pageant of the sea and England's drama upon"
5841,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",it. It is a spirited echo of the maritime Elizabethans; a vivid and
5842,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",orchestral work interspersed with splendid lyric passages and brisk
5843,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD","songs. The companion volume, an attempted reconstruction of the"
5844,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD","literary phase of the same period, is less successful; but these"
5845,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD","_Tales of the Mermaid Tavern_ (which introduce Shakespeare, Marlowe,"
5846,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD","Drayton, Raleigh, Ben Jonson, and other immortals) are alive and"
5847,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD","colorful, if somewhat too insistently rollicking and smoothly lilting."
5848,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",
5849,"TO MY DAUGHTER BETTY, THE GIFT OF GOD",His eight volumes were assembled in 1913 and published in two books of

5936,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And all around the organ there's a sea without a shore
5937,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Of human joys and wonders and regrets;
5938,THE BARREL-ORGAN,To remember and to recompense the music evermore

5941,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"Yes; as the music changes,"
5942,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"Like a prismatic glass,"

5945,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Dissects the common carnival

5954,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And bolder knights to battle go
5955,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"With sword and shield and lance,"
5956,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Than ever here on earth below

5970,THE BARREL-ORGAN,The nightingale is rather rare and yet they say you'll hear him there

5972,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"The linnet and the throstle, too, and after dark the long halloo"
5973,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"And golden-eyed _tu-whit, tu-whoo_ of owls that ogle London."
5974,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
5975,THE BARREL-ORGAN,For Noah hardly knew a bird of any kind that isn't heard
5976,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"At Kew, at Kew in lilac-time (and oh, so near to London!)"

5983,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Come down to Kew in lilac-time (is isn't far from London!)_
5984,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
5985,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"And then the troubadour begins to thrill the golden street,"
5986,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the city as the sun sinks low;
5987,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And in all the gaudy busses there are scores of weary feet
5988,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"Marking time, sweet time, with a dull mechanic beat,"
5989,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"And a thousand hearts are plunging to a love they'll never meet,"
5990,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"Through the meadows of the sunset, through the poppies and the wheat,"

5992,THE BARREL-ORGAN,

5998,THE BARREL-ORGAN,As _A che la morte_ parodies the world's eternal theme
5999,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And pulses with the sunset-glow?
6000,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
6001,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"There's a thief, perhaps, that listens with a face of frozen stone"
6002,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the City as the sun sinks low;
6003,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"There's a portly man of business with a balance of his own,"
6004,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"There's a clerk and there's a butcher of a soft reposeful tone,"
6005,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And they're all of them returning to the heavens they have known:
6006,THE BARREL-ORGAN,They are crammed and jammed in busses and--they're each of them alone
6007,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the land where the dead dreams go.
6008,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
6009,THE BARREL-ORGAN,There's a labourer that listens to the voices of the dead
6010,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the City as the sun sinks low;
6011,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And his hand begins to tremble and his face is rather red
6012,THE BARREL-ORGAN,As he sees a loafer watching him and--there he turns his head
6013,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"And stares into the sunset where his April love is fled,"
6014,THE BARREL-ORGAN,For he hears her softly singing and his lonely soul is led
6015,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Through the land where the dead dreams go ...
6016,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
6017,THE BARREL-ORGAN,There's a barrel-organ carolling across a golden street
6018,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the City as the sun sinks low;
6019,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Though the music's only Verdi there's a world to make it sweet
6020,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Just as yonder yellow sunset where the earth and heaven meet
6021,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"Mellows all the sooty City! Hark, a hundred thousand feet"
6022,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Are marching on to glory through the poppies and the wheat
6023,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the land where the dead dreams go.
6024,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
6025,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"So it's Jeremiah, Jeremiah,"
6026,THE BARREL-ORGAN,What have you to say
6027,THE BARREL-ORGAN,When you meet the garland girls
6028,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Tripping on their way?
6029,THE BARREL-ORGAN,All around my gala hat
6030,THE BARREL-ORGAN,I wear a wreath of roses
6031,THE BARREL-ORGAN,(A long and lonely year it is
6032,THE BARREL-ORGAN,I've waited for the May!)
6033,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"If any one should ask you,"
6034,THE BARREL-ORGAN,The reason why I wear it is--
6035,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"My own love, my true love is coming home to-day."
6036,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
6037,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And it's buy a bunch of violets for the lady
6038,THE BARREL-ORGAN,(_It's lilac-time in London; it's lilac-time in London!_)
6039,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Buy a bunch of violets for the lady;
6040,THE BARREL-ORGAN,While the sky burns blue above:
6041,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
6042,THE BARREL-ORGAN,On the other side the street you'll find it shady
6043,THE BARREL-ORGAN,(_It's lilac-time in London; it's lilac-time in London!_)
6044,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"But buy a bunch of violets for the lady,"
6045,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And tell her she's your own true love.
6046,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
6047,THE BARREL-ORGAN,There's a barrel-organ carolling across a golden street
6048,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the City as the sun sinks glittering and slow;
6049,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And the music's not immortal; but the world has made it sweet
6050,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And enriched it with the harmonies that make a song complete
6051,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"In the deeper heavens of music where the night and morning meet,"
6052,THE BARREL-ORGAN,As it dies into the sunset glow;
6053,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
6054,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And it pulses through the pleasures of the City and the pain
6055,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"That surround the singing organ like a large eternal light,"
6056,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And they've given it a glory and a part to play again
6057,THE BARREL-ORGAN,In the Symphony that rules the day and night.
6058,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
6059,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"And there, as the music changes,"
6060,THE BARREL-ORGAN,The song runs round again;
6061,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Once more it turns and ranges
6062,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Through all its joy and pain:
6063,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Dissects the common carnival
6064,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Of passions and regrets;
6065,THE BARREL-ORGAN,And the wheeling world remembers all
6066,THE BARREL-ORGAN,The wheeling song forgets.
6067,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
6068,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Once more _La Traviata_ sighs
6069,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Another sadder song:
6070,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Once more _Il Trovatore_ cries
6071,THE BARREL-ORGAN,A tale of deeper wrong;
6072,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Once more the knights to battle go
6073,THE BARREL-ORGAN,With sword and shield and lance
6074,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"Till once, once more, the shattered foe"
6075,THE BARREL-ORGAN,Has whirled into--a dance!
6076,THE BARREL-ORGAN,
6077,THE BARREL-ORGAN,"_Come down to Kew in lilac-time, in lilac-time, in lilac-time;"

6289,THE OLD WOMAN,
6290,THE OLD WOMAN,
6291,THE OLD WOMAN,"This unique personality was born in Dublin in February, 1882. Stephens"
6292,THE OLD WOMAN,was discovered in an office and saved from clerical slavery by George
6293,THE OLD WOMAN,"Russell (""A. E.""). Always a poet, Stephens's most poetic moments are"
6294,THE OLD WOMAN,"in his highly-colored prose. And yet, although the finest of his"
6295,THE OLD WOMAN,"novels, _The Crock of Gold_ (1912), contains more wild phantasy and"
6296,THE OLD WOMAN,"quaint imagery than all his volumes of verse, his _Insurrections_"
6297,THE OLD WOMAN,(1909) and _The Hill of Vision_ (1912) reveal a rebellious spirit that
6298,THE OLD WOMAN,is at once hotly ironic and coolly whimsical.
6299,THE OLD WOMAN,
6300,THE OLD WOMAN,Stephens's outstanding characteristic is his delightful blend of
6301,THE OLD WOMAN,"incongruities--he combines in his verse the grotesque, the buoyant and"
6302,THE OLD WOMAN,the profound. No fresher or more brightly vigorous imagination has
6303,THE OLD WOMAN,come out of Ireland since J. M. Synge.

6324,THE SHELL,"Of pebbles rolling round,"
6325,THE SHELL,For ever rolling with a hollow sound.
6326,THE SHELL,And bubbling sea-weeds as the waters go
6327,THE SHELL,Swish to and fro

6555,A HOUSE,"of _Interludes and Poems_, he was recognized as one of the greatest"
6556,A HOUSE,"metaphysical poets of his period. _Emblems of Love_ (1912), the ripest"

6561,A HOUSE,"are founded on scriptural themes, but his blank verse is not biblical"

6563,A HOUSE,surface of his verse which moves with a strong religious conviction.

6659,SONG,Another remarkable poet whose early death was a blow to English
6660,SONG,"literature, James Elroy Flecker, was born in London, November 5, 1884."
6661,SONG,"Possibly due to his low vitality, Flecker found little to interest him"
6662,SONG,"but a classical reaction against realism in verse, a delight in verbal"
6663,SONG,"craftsmanship, and a passion for technical perfection--especially the"
6664,SONG,deliberate technique of the French Parnassians whom he worshipped.
6665,SONG,"Flecker was opposed to any art that was emotional or that ""taught"""
6666,SONG,"anything. ""The poet's business,"" he declared, ""is not to save the soul"
6667,SONG,"of man, but to make it worth saving."""
6668,SONG,
6669,SONG,The advent of the war began to make Flecker's verse more personal and
6670,SONG,"romantic. The tuberculosis that finally killed him at Davos Platz,"
6671,SONG,"Switzerland, January 3, 1915, forced him from an Olympian disinterest"
6672,SONG,to a deep concern with life and death. He passionately denied that he
6673,SONG,"was weary of living ""as the pallid poets are,"" and he was attempting"
6674,SONG,higher flights of song when his singing ceased altogether.

6722,THE OLD SHIPS,"David Herbert Lawrence, born in 1885, is one of the most"

6724,THE OLD SHIPS,"from a febrile morbidity to an exalted and almost frenzied mysticism,"
6725,THE OLD SHIPS,"is seen even in his prose works--particularly in his short stories,"
6726,THE OLD SHIPS,"_The Prussian Officer_ (1917), his analytical _Sons and Lovers_"
6727,THE OLD SHIPS,"(1913), and the rhapsodic novel, _The Rainbow_ (1915)."
6728,THE OLD SHIPS,
6729,THE OLD SHIPS,As a poet he is often caught in the net of his own emotions; his
6730,THE OLD SHIPS,"passion thickens his utterance and distorts his rhythms, which"

6732,THE OLD SHIPS,range he is as powerful as he is poignant. His most notable volumes of
6733,THE OLD SHIPS,"poetry are _Amores_ (1916), _Look! We Have Come Through!_ (1918), and"

6788,STONE TREES,Last night a sword-light in the sky
6789,STONE TREES,Flashed a swift terror on the dark.
6790,STONE TREES,In that sharp light the fields did lie
6791,STONE TREES,Naked and stone-like; each tree stood

6812,STONE TREES,"It seemed an age, or time was none ..."
6813,STONE TREES,Slowly the earth heaved out of sleep
6814,STONE TREES,"And shivered, and the trees of stone"
6815,STONE TREES,"Bent and sighed in the gusty wind,"
6816,STONE TREES,And rain swept as birds flocking sweep.

6820,STONE TREES,"From all the wood came no brave bird,"

6993,SONG,_Siegfried Sassoon_
6994,SONG,
6995,SONG,
6996,SONG,"Siegfried Loraine Sassoon, the poet whom Masefield hailed as ""one of"
6997,SONG,"England's most brilliant rising stars,"" was born September 8, 1886. He"
6998,SONG,"was educated at Marlborough and Clare College, Cambridge, and was a"
6999,SONG,"captain in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers. He fought three times in France,"
7000,SONG,"once in Palestine, winning the Military Cross for bringing in wounded"
7001,SONG,on the battlefield.
7002,SONG,
7003,SONG,His poetry divides itself sharply in two moods--the lyric and the
7004,SONG,ironic. His early lilting poems were without significance or
7005,SONG,individuality. But with _The Old Huntsman_ (1917) Sassoon found his
7006,SONG,"own idiom, and became one of the leading younger poets upon the"
7007,SONG,"appearance of this striking volume. The first poem, a long monologue"
7008,SONG,"evidently inspired by Masefield, gave little evidence of what was to"
7009,SONG,"come. Immediately following it, however, came a series of war poems,"
7010,SONG,undisguised in their tragedy and bitterness. Every line of these
7011,SONG,quivering stanzas bore the mark of a sensitive and outraged nature;
7012,SONG,there was scarcely a phrase that did not protest against the
7013,SONG,"""glorification"" and false glamour of war."
7014,SONG,
7015,SONG,_Counter-Attack_ appeared in 1918. In this volume Sassoon turned
7016,SONG,entirely from an ordered loveliness to the gigantic brutality of war.
7017,SONG,"At heart a lyric idealist, the bloody years intensified and twisted"
7018,SONG,his tenderness till what was stubborn and satiric in him forced its
7019,SONG,way to the top. In _Counter-Attack_ Sassoon found his angry outlet.
7020,SONG,Most of these poems are choked with passion; many of them are torn
7021,SONG,"out, roots and all, from the very core of an intense conviction; they"
7022,SONG,"rush on, not so much because of the poet's art but almost in spite of"
7023,SONG,"it. A suave utterance, a neatly-joined structure would be out of place"
7024,SONG,"and even inexcusable in poems like ""The Rear-Guard,"" ""To Any Dead"
7025,SONG,"Officer,"" ""Does It Matter?""--verses that are composed of love, fever"
7026,SONG,and indignation.
7027,SONG,
7028,SONG,"Can Sassoon see nothing glorious or uplifting in war? His friend,"
7029,SONG,"Robert Nichols, another poet and soldier, speaks for him in a preface."
7030,SONG,"""Let no one ever,"" Nichols quotes Sassoon as saying, ""from henceforth"
7031,SONG,say one word in any way countenancing war. It is dangerous even to
7032,SONG,speak of how here and there the individual may gain some hardship of
7033,SONG,"soul by it. For war is hell, and those who institute it are criminals."
7034,SONG,"Were there even anything to say for it, it should not be said; for its"
7035,SONG,"spiritual disasters far outweigh any of its advantages...."" Nichols"
7036,SONG,"adds his approval to these sentences, saying, ""For myself, this is the"
7037,SONG,"truth. War does not ennoble, it degrades."""
7038,SONG,
7039,SONG,Early in 1920 Sassoon visited America. At the same time he brought out
7040,SONG,"his _Picture Show_ (1920), a vigorous answer to those who feared that"
7041,SONG,"Sassoon had ""written himself out"" or had begun to burn away in his own"
7042,SONG,"fire. Had Rupert Brooke lived, he might have written many of these"
7043,SONG,lacerated but somehow exalted lines. Sassoon's three volumes are the
7044,SONG,most vital and unsparing records of the war we have had. They
7045,SONG,synthesize in poetry what Barbusse's _Under Fire_ spreads out in
7046,SONG,panoramic prose.

7224,THE GREAT LOVER[19],"So proudly with the splendour of Love's praise,"
7225,THE GREAT LOVER[19],"The pain, the calm, and the astonishment,"
7226,THE GREAT LOVER[19],"Desire illimitable, and still content,"
7227,THE GREAT LOVER[19],"And all dear names men use, to cheat despair,"

7230,THE GREAT LOVER[19],"Now, ere the unthinking silence on that strife"

7238,THE GREAT LOVER[19],Love is a flame;--we have beaconed the world's night.
7239,THE GREAT LOVER[19],"A city:--and we have built it, these and I."
7240,THE GREAT LOVER[19],An emperor:--we have taught the world to die.
7241,THE GREAT LOVER[19],"So, for their sakes I loved, ere I go hence,"

7253,THE GREAT LOVER[19],Rainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of wood;
7254,THE GREAT LOVER[19],And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers;
7255,THE GREAT LOVER[19],"And flowers themselves, that sway through sunny hours,"
7256,THE GREAT LOVER[19],Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon;
7257,THE GREAT LOVER[19],"Then, the cool kindliness of sheets, that soon"
7258,THE GREAT LOVER[19],Smooth away trouble; and the rough male kiss
7259,THE GREAT LOVER[19],Of blankets; grainy wood; live hair that is
7260,THE GREAT LOVER[19],Shining and free; blue-massing clouds; the keen
7261,THE GREAT LOVER[19],Unpassioned beauty of a great machine;
7262,THE GREAT LOVER[19],The benison of hot water; furs to touch;
7263,THE GREAT LOVER[19],The good smell of old clothes; and other such--

7278,THE GREAT LOVER[19],"And oaks; and brown horse-chestnuts, glossy-new;"
7279,THE GREAT LOVER[19],And new-peeled sticks; and shining pools on grass;--
7280,THE GREAT LOVER[19],All these have been my loves. And these shall pass.
7281,THE GREAT LOVER[19],"Whatever passes not, in the great hour,"
7282,THE GREAT LOVER[19],"Nor all my passion, all my prayers, have power"

7287,THE GREAT LOVER[19],"--Oh, never a doubt but, somewhere, I shall wake,"
7288,THE GREAT LOVER[19],"And give what's left of love again, and make"
7289,THE GREAT LOVER[19],"New friends, now strangers...."
7290,THE GREAT LOVER[19],"But the best I've known,"

8065,COMPLAINT,His first contributions appeared in _Wheels_ (an annual anthology of a

8068,COMPLAINT,"strengthened by a reading of _Argonaut and Juggernaut_ (1920), where"
8069,COMPLAINT,Sitwell's cleverness and satire are fused. His most remarkable though
8070,COMPLAINT,his least brilliant poems are his irregular and fiery protests against
8071,COMPLAINT,smugness and hypocrisy. But even Sitwell's more conventional poetry
8072,COMPLAINT,has a freshness of movement and definiteness of outline.

8246,TO GERMANY,
8247,TO GERMANY,

8249,TO GERMANY,"musketeers"" (the other two being the poets Siegfried Sassoon and"
8250,TO GERMANY,"Robert Nichols), he was one of several writers who, roused by the war"
8251,TO GERMANY,"and giving himself to his country, refused to glorify warfare or chant"
8252,TO GERMANY,"new hymns of hate. Like Sassoon, Graves also reacts against the storm"
8253,TO GERMANY,"of fury and blood-lust (see his poem ""To a Dead Boche""), but,"
8254,TO GERMANY,"fortified by a lighter and more whimsical spirit, where Sassoon is"
8255,TO GERMANY,"violent, Graves is volatile; where Sassoon is bitter, Graves is almost"
8256,TO GERMANY,blithe.
8257,TO GERMANY,
8258,TO GERMANY,"An unconquerable gayety rises from his _Fairies and Fusiliers_ (1917),"
8259,TO GERMANY,a surprising and healing humor that is warmly individual. In _Country
8260,TO GERMANY,Sentiment_ (1919) Graves turns to a fresh and more serious simplicity.
8261,TO GERMANY,But a buoyant fancy ripples beneath the most archaic of his ballads
8262,TO GERMANY,and a quaintly original turn of mind saves them from their own echoes.
