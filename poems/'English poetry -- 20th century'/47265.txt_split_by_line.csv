102,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,
103,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,(_A pleasant maxim of old time directed the gardener to leave one corner
104,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,"as nature planned it, for the little people.  Thus welcomed, they might"
105,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,"be trusted to show their human hosts goodwill, friendship, and"
106,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,service._)
107,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,
108,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,"You have it, or you have it not:"
109,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,"The cantle of the Pixies’ plot,"
110,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,Where never spade nor hoe shall ply
111,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,To break that treasured sanctity.
112,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,Touch no bloom there; uproot no weed;
113,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,Let what will blow.
114,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,"Suffer the thistle, briar and thorn to grow,"
115,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,The dandelion to seed.
116,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,
117,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,"Though full the garden of your mind,"
118,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,Well planted on a soil that’s kind;
119,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,"Your hedges gay, your borders clean,"
120,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,"Your seasons fair, your clime serene,"
121,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,"Yet trammel not the Pixies’ mite,"
122,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,For well-coming
123,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,"Chance little, wandering, weary, fairy thing"
124,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,Lost in the dim owl-light.
125,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,
126,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,"Still virgin, free and set apart,"
127,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,"Ordain one dingle of your heart,"
128,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,Where visions home and wing to you
129,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,The golden dreams that might come true.
130,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,Herein a gentler dawn than day
131,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,Shall often break
132,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,"For foot-sore spirits, tired of reason’s ache,"
133,*THE PIXIES’ PLOT*,And children come to play.

139,*THE CHARM*,
140,*THE CHARM*,
141,*THE CHARM*,When chafers drone their litany
142,*THE CHARM*,"And pray, ""Oh, Father, grant that we"
143,*THE CHARM*,"From airy-mouse delivered be,"""
144,*THE CHARM*,Go seek the charm.
145,*THE CHARM*,
146,*THE CHARM*,"Under the sky, when a star shoots,"
147,*THE CHARM*,"Beneath an oak, when the owl hoots,"
148,*THE CHARM*,"Gather ye simples, dig ye roots"
149,*THE CHARM*,For the rare charm.
150,*THE CHARM*,
151,*THE CHARM*,That glassy ghost upon a thorn--
152,*THE CHARM*,The raiment of a snake outworn--
153,*THE CHARM*,Must backward through the dark be borne
154,*THE CHARM*,To feed the charm.
155,*THE CHARM*,
156,*THE CHARM*,A glow-worm--she whose gentle light
157,*THE CHARM*,Glimmers green-gold through a blue night
158,*THE CHARM*,Beside the churchyard aconite--
159,*THE CHARM*,Shall help the charm.
160,*THE CHARM*,
161,*THE CHARM*,One willow from the cradle take
162,*THE CHARM*,"Where a boy baby lies awake,"
163,*THE CHARM*,And splinters off a coffin break
164,*THE CHARM*,To build the charm.
165,*THE CHARM*,
166,*THE CHARM*,"A tarnished silver chalice bring,"
167,*THE CHARM*,"Dead gossips gave at christening,"
168,*THE CHARM*,And dip the moonlight from a spring
169,*THE CHARM*,To crown the charm.
170,*THE CHARM*,
171,*THE CHARM*,"This much, God wot, a child might do,"
172,*THE CHARM*,Yet all must fail if haply you
173,*THE CHARM*,"Lack a child’s faith, so trusting, true,"
174,*THE CHARM*,To bless the charm.
175,*THE CHARM*,
176,*THE CHARM*,Many the spells of high degree
177,*THE CHARM*,And fruitful happiness I see
178,*THE CHARM*,"All lost, for faith to set them free"
179,*THE CHARM*,And work the charm.

186,*JOE’S DONKEY*,
187,*JOE’S DONKEY*,"The harp of night had silver strings,"
188,*JOE’S DONKEY*,"The moon was low, the stars burned dim,"
189,*JOE’S DONKEY*,"When from a wood, with roaring wings,"
190,*JOE’S DONKEY*,Joe flushed a brace of cherubim.
191,*JOE’S DONKEY*,
192,*JOE’S DONKEY*,His eye did bulge at sign so brave
193,*JOE’S DONKEY*,To see the shining angels pass;
194,*JOE’S DONKEY*,"Then, happening beside her grave,"
195,*JOE’S DONKEY*,He met his dead and buried ass!
196,*JOE’S DONKEY*,
197,*JOE’S DONKEY*,She’d broke a leg and so was slain
198,*JOE’S DONKEY*,And buried here a week ago;
199,*JOE’S DONKEY*,"Now, all alive and sound again,"
200,*JOE’S DONKEY*,She brayed with joy to welcome Joe!
201,*JOE’S DONKEY*,
202,*JOE’S DONKEY*,"A holy cross that donkeys bear,"
203,*JOE’S DONKEY*,"Since Jesus Christ did deign to ride,"
204,*JOE’S DONKEY*,The cherubs tempted to repair
205,*JOE’S DONKEY*,That ancient beast in bone and hide.
206,*JOE’S DONKEY*,
207,*JOE’S DONKEY*,The harp of morn had golden strings
208,*JOE’S DONKEY*,Ere home they came--Joe’s ass and he;
209,*JOE’S DONKEY*,And when their neighbours heard these things
210,*JOE’S DONKEY*,They praised the Lord right heartily.

219,*DIANA*,For with her bitter sickle keen
220,*DIANA*,"She comes between, she comes between,"
221,*DIANA*,And cuts the tender from the true.
222,*DIANA*,
223,*DIANA*,Look not upon a white full moon:
224,*DIANA*,Her stiff-starched pudency doth shame
225,*DIANA*,"The throbbing pulse, the leaping flame,"
226,*DIANA*,And freezes passion at its noon.
227,*DIANA*,
228,*DIANA*,Look not upon a moon that’s old
229,*DIANA*,"With fallen breast and shadowy eyes,"
230,*DIANA*,"Till the last hope of loving dies,"
231,*DIANA*,And heart’s outworn and blood run cold.

239,*THE MOUSE AND THE EPITAPH*,In moonlight grey the hungry church-yard mouse
240,*THE MOUSE AND THE EPITAPH*,Sat on old William Blee--his narrow house.
241,*THE MOUSE AND THE EPITAPH*,"Climbing the mound, an ancient slate he read,"
242,*THE MOUSE AND THE EPITAPH*,"Then spoke, with rustic frankness, to the dead."
243,*THE MOUSE AND THE EPITAPH*,"""’A husband and a father dear’: What then?"
244,*THE MOUSE AND THE EPITAPH*,So much is true of mice as well as men.
245,*THE MOUSE AND THE EPITAPH*,"’Friend to the poor’?  That’s humbug, Billy Blee!"

254,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,"Through the green dell she went,"
255,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,"Bright haired, with cheeks that burned;"
256,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,Her passion hardly pent;
257,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,Her eyes upon him turned.
258,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,Her crocus-coloured gown
259,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,"Over her white, young breast beat up and down."
260,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,
261,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,"Adream, he did not guess,"
262,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,But dwelt upon his thought
263,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,"Of perfect loveliness,"
264,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,Nor heeded when she caught
265,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,"A sigh his bosom breathed,"
266,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,And murmured it again with music wreathed.
267,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,
268,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,"Oh, wasted wealth of love;"
269,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,"While Echo’s heart will break,"
270,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,"Narcissus from above,"
271,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,"Within a glassy lake,"
272,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,Beholds perfection lie
273,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,"And, for the vision of himself, must die."
274,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,
275,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,"Now, hid in bare-ribbed rock"
276,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,"With crocus-coloured veins,"
277,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,"She guards from windy shock,"
278,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,"She shields from wild March rains,"
279,*ECHO AND NARCISSUS*,"Where grass and granite meet,"

288,*THE SANDHILLS*,"Oh, naked-footed boy, with the wild hair"
289,*THE SANDHILLS*,"And laughing eyes, is it so long ago"
290,*THE SANDHILLS*,"Among these windy dunes you made your lair,"
291,*THE SANDHILLS*,Beside the immutable sea’s unwearied ebb and flow?
292,*THE SANDHILLS*,
293,*THE SANDHILLS*,Above you sings the horrent bent; the sun
294,*THE SANDHILLS*,Finds you and burns your budding limbs to brown;
295,*THE SANDHILLS*,"You race the waves and wade and leap and run,"
296,*THE SANDHILLS*,"Then in the sweet, hot sand, contented, cuddle down"
297,*THE SANDHILLS*,
298,*THE SANDHILLS*,"You dream great dreams, while all the upper air"
299,*THE SANDHILLS*,"Is musical with mews; and round about,"
300,*THE SANDHILLS*,"Upon the flats among the sea-ways there,"
301,*THE SANDHILLS*,The dim sea-lavender spreads her purple fingers out.
302,*THE SANDHILLS*,
303,*THE SANDHILLS*,And still the sandhills roll and still the sea
304,*THE SANDHILLS*,Flings a straight line of everlasting blue
305,*THE SANDHILLS*,Athwart their shining hillocks; solemnly
306,*THE SANDHILLS*,"The ships go by, but not the wondrous ships you knew."
307,*THE SANDHILLS*,
308,*THE SANDHILLS*,When first your path among the sand dunes fell--
309,*THE SANDHILLS*,The dunes that stretched as now and shone of yore
310,*THE SANDHILLS*,In their bright nakedness--a magic spell
311,*THE SANDHILLS*,Of mystery they wove along the shining shore.
312,*THE SANDHILLS*,
313,*THE SANDHILLS*,"This poppy with the horn, this bindweed white"
314,*THE SANDHILLS*,And salicornia in its crimson bands
315,*THE SANDHILLS*,"Meant more, far more than beauty and delight:"
316,*THE SANDHILLS*,They stood for treasure torn from drowning pirates’ hands.
317,*THE SANDHILLS*,
318,*THE SANDHILLS*,These amber weeds were then a garment brave;
319,*THE SANDHILLS*,These agate stones were gems of splendid size
320,*THE SANDHILLS*,"Once decked a mermaid in a deep sea cave,"
321,*THE SANDHILLS*,"Lit by gigantic fish from their green, glimmering eyes."
322,*THE SANDHILLS*,
323,*THE SANDHILLS*,"The sandhills were your giants, cruel or kind;"
324,*THE SANDHILLS*,Each falling billow told another tale;
325,*THE SANDHILLS*,Fairies and goblins flew upon the wind;
326,*THE SANDHILLS*,There lurked a tragedy in every sea-bird’s wail.
327,*THE SANDHILLS*,
328,*THE SANDHILLS*,And now the watchful sea doth bid me say;
329,*THE SANDHILLS*,The salt air whispers me to speak and tell
330,*THE SANDHILLS*,Where is that little boy from yesterday
331,*THE SANDHILLS*,Whom wind and wave and sand and sunshine knew so well?
332,*THE SANDHILLS*,
333,*THE SANDHILLS*,"""He was our playmate; us he understood"
334,*THE SANDHILLS*,And ran to us with glory in his eyes;
335,*THE SANDHILLS*,We loved him and we wrought to work his good;
336,*THE SANDHILLS*,We made him strong and brave and with our wisdom wise.
337,*THE SANDHILLS*,
338,*THE SANDHILLS*,"""Will he not come again?  The flowerets small"
339,*THE SANDHILLS*,Have opened for his eager hands once more;
340,*THE SANDHILLS*,"Among the yellow whins the linnets call,"
341,*THE SANDHILLS*,The wrack and shells he sought still drift along the shore.
342,*THE SANDHILLS*,
343,*THE SANDHILLS*,"""He climbed the crests of all our ridges grey"
344,*THE SANDHILLS*,And sang to us and paddled where our foam
345,*THE SANDHILLS*,Thins to a crystal film.  But yesterday
346,*THE SANDHILLS*,A happy sprite was he; where now does our boy roam?
347,*THE SANDHILLS*,
348,*THE SANDHILLS*,"""Deep of the many voices, on whose face"
349,*THE SANDHILLS*,"No seal is set through all the centuries fled,"
350,*THE SANDHILLS*,"Laugh on at time, nor know the hurricane race"
351,*THE SANDHILLS*,"Of his few, hurtling years above a human head."
352,*THE SANDHILLS*,
353,*THE SANDHILLS*,"""And thou, old dune; the stars of heaven shall rove,"
354,*THE SANDHILLS*,The galaxies break up to wheel about
355,*THE SANDHILLS*,"And in new, glittering constellations move"
356,*THE SANDHILLS*,Before thine hour-glass grey hath run its measure out.
357,*THE SANDHILLS*,
358,*THE SANDHILLS*,"""Your yesterday, you immemorial things,"
359,*THE SANDHILLS*,"Whereon the ages yet no shadow cast,"
360,*THE SANDHILLS*,For me the hurrying and sleepless wings
361,*THE SANDHILLS*,Of year on stormy year have swept into the past.
362,*THE SANDHILLS*,
363,*THE SANDHILLS*,"""Yet think not I have lost that faith and joy"
364,*THE SANDHILLS*,Felt when my world was young and I a part.
365,*THE SANDHILLS*,"Oh, sea and sand and wild, west wind, your boy"
366,*THE SANDHILLS*,"Lies hidden safe within my steadfast, changeless heart."""

372,*THE GHOST*,
373,*THE GHOST*,
374,*THE GHOST*,Night-foundered to the ruin he came
375,*THE GHOST*,Nor recked of its uncanny fame;
376,*THE GHOST*,"A haunt of slumber opened here,"
377,*THE GHOST*,"And weariness, that casts out fear,"
378,*THE GHOST*,His footsteps led.
379,*THE GHOST*,The moon swam low; the woods were still;
380,*THE GHOST*,Dog foxes barked upon the hill;
381,*THE GHOST*,With zig-zag wing a flitter-mouse
382,*THE GHOST*,Flew in and out the haunted house
383,*THE GHOST*,And overhead.
384,*THE GHOST*,
385,*THE GHOST*,"Within, decaying wood and lime"
386,*THE GHOST*,Lifted their incense up to time;
387,*THE GHOST*,"The foot fell hollow; echoes woke,"
388,*THE GHOST*,"And whispering, half-heard voices spoke"
389,*THE GHOST*,Behind the dark.
390,*THE GHOST*,"Aloft, the drowsy wanderer found"
391,*THE GHOST*,A chamber far above the ground;
392,*THE GHOST*,"Whose casement, rusty-ironed and high,"
393,*THE GHOST*,"Gaped ivy-clad upon the sky,"
394,*THE GHOST*,Starlit and stark.
395,*THE GHOST*,
396,*THE GHOST*,White-fingered now the moonbeams ran
397,*THE GHOST*,To ripple on the resting man.
398,*THE GHOST*,He saw their stealthy silver creep
399,*THE GHOST*,As it would drown him in his sleep
400,*THE GHOST*,With splendour mild.
401,*THE GHOST*,"And then a subtle shadow moved,"
402,*THE GHOST*,A spirit that the dead had loved:
403,*THE GHOST*,For wanly limned against the gloom
404,*THE GHOST*,"Of that forbid, forgotten room"
405,*THE GHOST*,There ran a child.
406,*THE GHOST*,
407,*THE GHOST*,"She twinkled in her candid shift,"
408,*THE GHOST*,"Light as a moth, so silent, swift,"
409,*THE GHOST*,And peeped and peered for what might be
410,*THE GHOST*,Hid in that ancient nursery--
411,*THE GHOST*,A babe of joy.
412,*THE GHOST*,But something called the busy wight:
413,*THE GHOST*,She faded sudden from his sight;
414,*THE GHOST*,"And, as her little glimmer paled"
415,*THE GHOST*,"Like a glass bell, the ghostling wailed,"
416,*THE GHOST*,"""Where is my toy?"""

460,*DREAMS*,"In sanctity of night and sleep,"
461,*DREAMS*,Drift visions from the shadow shore--
462,*DREAMS*,"Small, patient forms that creep."
463,*DREAMS*,They move in drab; they wear no wings;
464,*DREAMS*,They are the dreams that might come true--
465,*DREAMS*,Meek phantoms of the modest things

472,*DREAMS*,They smile with eyes of queens and kings;

933,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,
934,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,
935,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,While all alone I wandered
936,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,"At even by the sea,"
937,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,Where winds and water pondered
938,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,Of how they came to be;
939,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,Where kittiwakes were crying
940,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,And salty spindrift flying
941,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,Through daylight slowly dying
942,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,A Shape confronted me.
943,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,
944,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,She faced the broad Atlantic--
945,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,"That maid of stately mien,"
946,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,"Purer than foam, gigantic"
947,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,As Amazonian Queen.
948,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,"Her billowy robe, unknowing,"
949,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,"How wild the wind was blowing,"
950,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,"Showed not a throb or flowing,"
951,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,Hung steady and serene.
952,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,
953,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,It was no fellow being
954,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,"For she stood ten feet high,"
955,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,"And seaward gazed, unseeing"
956,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,The human passer-by;
957,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,"But only billows roaming,"
958,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,And wide-winged sea-fowl homing
959,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,Through crepuscule and gloaming
960,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,Beneath an ashen sky.
961,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,
962,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,The spectre rose before me
963,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,"Most woeful, wan and white"
964,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,Upon that foreshore stormy
965,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,Between the day and night;
966,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,And such an apparition
967,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,"In this unique position,"
968,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,Despite her sad condition
969,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,Awoke my wild delight.
970,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,
971,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,"Then came three youthful creatures,"
972,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,And them I bade with awe
973,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,Behold the mournful features
974,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,Of phantom on the shore.
975,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,They laughed and said she’d drifted
976,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,To land with bosom rifted--
977,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,A figure-head uplifted
978,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,"From wreck of ""Margery Dawe."""
979,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,
980,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,"They dared, those sea-scout shavers"
981,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,"Who watched this lonely coast,"
982,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,Assert in treble quavers
983,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,We stood before a post;
984,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,They treated as a fiction
985,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,My gratified conviction
986,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,"That, in her pale affliction,"
987,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,We’d met a salt-sea ghost!
988,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,
989,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,Thus hard-eyed youth advances
990,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,"By shadowless, stark way"
991,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,Our middle-aged romances
992,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,To slight and scorn and slay;
993,*THE SEA SCOUTS*,Our make-believe to tatter;

1158,*JILL BASSETT*,Must needs be a light-footed blade.
1159,*JILL BASSETT*,
1160,*JILL BASSETT*,"So said the folk; but I had pelf,"

1165,*JILL BASSETT*,"She danced into my arms, and then,"
1166,*JILL BASSETT*,Along of men
1167,*JILL BASSETT*,"And some harsh words I’d got to say,"
1168,*JILL BASSETT*,One autumn time she danced away.
1169,*JILL BASSETT*,
1170,*JILL BASSETT*,"She vanished, like a bow on rain,"

1174,*JILL BASSETT*,
1175,*JILL BASSETT*,Then came a bit of funny news
1176,*JILL BASSETT*,From Billy Bewes:
1177,*JILL BASSETT*,He’d seen the wretch at Christmas time
1178,*JILL BASSETT*,Dancing in Plymouth pantomime!
1179,*JILL BASSETT*,
1180,*JILL BASSETT*,For five good year no more was heard
1181,*JILL BASSETT*,Of the rash bird;
1182,*JILL BASSETT*,Then danced she back; but not to I:
1183,*JILL BASSETT*,Her mother took her in to die.
1184,*JILL BASSETT*,
1185,*JILL BASSETT*,"Her breathing parts was nearly gone,"
1186,*JILL BASSETT*,Her dancing done.
1187,*JILL BASSETT*,"She wilted, like a davered rose;"
1188,*JILL BASSETT*,But I forgave her at the close.
1189,*JILL BASSETT*,
1190,*JILL BASSETT*,With Bassett folk they dug her pit;
1191,*JILL BASSETT*,It wasn’t fit
1192,*JILL BASSETT*,That she should lie where I shall go:
1193,*JILL BASSETT*,Her mother granted that was so.
1194,*JILL BASSETT*,
1195,*JILL BASSETT*,"Then, passing New Year’s night, I saw"

1199,*JILL BASSETT*,
1200,*JILL BASSETT*,I’ll take my oath afore my God
1201,*JILL BASSETT*,She swept the sod
1202,*JILL BASSETT*,With naked feet and showed her charms
1203,*JILL BASSETT*,And twirled about her twinkling arms.
1204,*JILL BASSETT*,
1205,*JILL BASSETT*,A brace of owls that saw her too
1206,*JILL BASSETT*,"Made their hulloo,"
1207,*JILL BASSETT*,To which she danced so wondrous brave
1208,*JILL BASSETT*,Over the silver on her grave.
1209,*JILL BASSETT*,
1210,*JILL BASSETT*,Mayhap the cold got in her bones
1211,*JILL BASSETT*,"Under the stones,"
1212,*JILL BASSETT*,And up the wilful ghostey came
1213,*JILL BASSETT*,To warm herself at her old game.
1214,*JILL BASSETT*,
1215,*JILL BASSETT*,And I was on my hoss’s back--
