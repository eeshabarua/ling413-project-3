57,PRELUDE,"The stars would be. Husht now the thickets lie,"

59,PRELUDE,A note--and now from bush to bush it goes--
60,PRELUDE,A prelude--now victorious light along
61,PRELUDE,The west will come till every bramble glows

63,PRELUDE,"Shaken in song;  O heart, be ready now,"
64,PRELUDE,"Cold in your night, be ready now to sing."
65,PRELUDE,Dawn as it wakes the sleeping bird on bough

67,PRELUDE,"She is your dawn, O heart,--sing, till the night"
68,PRELUDE,"Of death shall come, the gospel of her light."

73,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
74,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And Jonathan too had honour in his heart,"
75,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Jonathan who with an armour-bearer went
76,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Alone by Michmash to the Philistines,"
77,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And met a spray of swords because of courage
78,DAVID AND JONATHAN,That made him single greater than a host.
79,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Jonathan too had known his battles, dared"
80,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"At any hour the coming of death, because"
81,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"In twilight silence he had walked with God,"
82,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Read Him in blossoms and the mountain brooks,"
83,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And learnt that death, well known, can alter nothing."
84,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"He was a brown man, burnt with love of summer,"
85,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"His young beard curled, and russet as the eyes"
86,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"That looked on life, and feared it, yet were master,"
87,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Because they knew the tyranny they feared,"
88,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Measured it, learnt it, gazed it into nothing."
89,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
90,DAVID AND JONATHAN,....
91,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
92,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And now he watched the boy, the son of Jesse,"
93,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"David with hair like maples in October,"
94,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And skin that women loving coveted,"
95,DAVID AND JONATHAN,David with eyes that often by the sheepfolds
96,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Had looked through leaves up to the folds of heaven,"
97,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And seeing them crammed with golden fleece of stars,"
98,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Had known how the blood can run because of beauty.
99,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Jonathan watched him take the armour off
100,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Given by Saul, and choose the bright smooth pebbles,"
101,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And walk out from the Israelitish throng
102,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Into the field against the Philistine giant.
103,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Watching, he snatched his sword and cried to Saul,"
104,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"""Bid him come back. This murder must not be."""
105,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And as he spoke, he knew the words were treason,"
106,DAVID AND JONATHAN,His heart alone in all the world was sure
107,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"That David was the Lord's appointed arm,"
108,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"To meet this bulk of dirt, this giant fear"
109,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Brandishing out of the loathly camps of evil.
110,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And before Saul could answer, he put down"
111,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"The sword, and said, ""I love him. Let him go."""
112,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
113,DAVID AND JONATHAN,....
114,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
115,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"But the words, I love him, were not for his father Saul,"
116,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Hardly Jonathan knowing he spake them out.
117,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"But as he looked on David love was there,"
118,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Waking from that in David that he himself
119,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"A little was, and always greatly shaping"
120,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Himself towards, so that his name was spoken"
121,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Famously in Saul's kingdom. It was courage,"
122,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"The clean heart, undivided in its doing,"
123,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"The purpose that, being bodied in the brain,"
124,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Thenceforth knew every trickling argument
125,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"That fell from tongues of persuading circumstance,"
126,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"As lures of evil ever threatening life,"
127,DAVID AND JONATHAN,That Jonathan loved above all enterprise.
128,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"He knew, or the rarer man within him knew,"
129,DAVID AND JONATHAN,That once your yea in holy meditation
130,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Had shaped itself in the perfect syllable,"
131,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Thenceforth no nay from any other tongue
132,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Or wise or passionate or masterful,"
133,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Could be listened to without the shame of sin
134,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Corrupting all your constancy for ever.
135,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"He knew the curse of good betraying good,"
136,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Till both in bleak irresolution fall.
137,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And all his years was Jonathan's anguish only
138,DAVID AND JONATHAN,To keep this tillage of his wisdom clean.
139,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
140,DAVID AND JONATHAN,.....
141,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
142,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Since boyhood he had known Philistia
143,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"For the black thing it was, a plague opposed"
144,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Always against the loveliness of Israel,"
145,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And when his father Saul was anointed king
146,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"By Samuel in Ramah, then Jonathan knew"
147,DAVID AND JONATHAN,How all the lessons of his youth had been
148,DAVID AND JONATHAN,To fit him for the striking of the men
149,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Who profaned beauty and let the soul be blind.
150,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And he was diligent in bronze and arms,"
151,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And kept his body supple, and his eye"
152,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Keen, and the coming of his hooves was thunder,"
153,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Wherever battle fell. He bore a flame,"
154,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Zealous and pure, in the heavens of his mind,"
155,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"To serve and to instruct. Aye, to instruct--"
156,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"There was the biting blemish, as we shall see."
157,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
158,DAVID AND JONATHAN,.....
159,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
160,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Philistia was foul, and Jonathan knew,"
161,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And the voice of God within him was plain and constant
162,DAVID AND JONATHAN,To strike and strike unwearying to the end.
163,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And then the poor, precise, infirmity"
164,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"That loads good minds with ever seeming virtue,"
165,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Until they cast their treasure to the dust,"
166,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Crept on him, wound about the gleaming truth"
167,DAVID AND JONATHAN,That was his one foundation. Day by day
168,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"He was resolved, and then the grain of doubt"
169,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Would come to hurt the riding of his thought,"
170,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And break the level balance that it had.
171,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Was then the Philistine mere black? That day
172,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Jonathan's arm half paused upon the blow,"
173,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And evil went a little scatheless off.
174,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Surely the worst even of adversaries
175,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Had somewhere beams that pointed to salvation,"
176,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And hasty judgment might not be the will
177,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Of an all-seeing Lord? Then would the vengeance
178,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Falter, and stay, and Jonathan's battle failed."
179,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And always then was bitterness and reproach
180,DAVID AND JONATHAN,In the night watches when upon his couch
181,DAVID AND JONATHAN,He looked on the stars studding his little window
182,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Before sleep came. Then he would speak again
183,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"The word that single was his valiance,"
184,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"His only truth, his warrant as a man,"
185,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And once again Philistia was doomed.
186,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Then for a season clean the stroke and sure
187,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"That Jonathan drove, and black was known for black,"
188,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Till slowly as before would mount and mount
189,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Scruple on scruple, as was not he himself"
190,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"A little black sometimes, or plainly wicked?"
191,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And should the wicked man not be redeemed?
192,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Merely destruction surely was no answer,"
193,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Since yet the wickedness must wander somewhere?
194,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"How should he say, I, Jonathan of Israel"
195,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Am good, and you the Philistine are cursed,"
196,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Since in that face was something that had been
197,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Learnt from the buds and corn and frozen hills
198,DAVID AND JONATHAN,That he himself had known for seals of God?
199,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And would not his power on Israel increase,"
200,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Take on a loftier authority,"
201,DAVID AND JONATHAN,If to his famous arms he could add a tale
202,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Of counsel working in the hearts of men,"
203,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Moving them to a finer charity,"
204,DAVID AND JONATHAN,A little pity for offence? And so
205,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Instruction like a worm was at his roots,"
206,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And pride of virtue made Jonathan forget.
207,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Then sometimes as he knew himself betrayed
208,DAVID AND JONATHAN,He would cry upon his spirit in the night--
209,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
210,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"I, Jonathan, who know"
211,DAVID AND JONATHAN,The processes of God
212,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Moving within me,"
213,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Turn aside to my idols of desire.
214,DAVID AND JONATHAN,He has taught me the ways
215,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Of Philistine cruelty. He
216,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Shows me the bad man toiling to the ruin
217,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Of beauty and the free spirit on earth,"
218,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And has equipped me for the establishment
219,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Of His will in this battle, and I fail."
220,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"I am a leaf spinning about the wind,"
221,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Who have been shown the ways of stedfastness.
222,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"O Israel, I have heard"
223,DAVID AND JONATHAN,My dedication made
224,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"To your sweet service by the voice of Him,"
225,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And I betray
226,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"That wisdom, that great simpleness of wisdom,"
227,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Inventing in my brain
228,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Fantastic argument
229,DAVID AND JONATHAN,As though God's mind
230,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Had missed the brighter pools
231,DAVID AND JONATHAN,That I alone could visit and gaze into.
232,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"He tells me, and I hear"
233,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Voices not His.
234,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Knowing, I question. And I am ashamed."
235,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
236,DAVID AND JONATHAN,So Jonathan saw walking at his side
237,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Always a shadow that was his own denial.
238,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
239,DAVID AND JONATHAN,.....
240,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
241,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And now was April mirrored in the plumes
242,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Of ravens and the green of the young wheat,"
243,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And dusky ewes with white lambs in the sun
244,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Lay in the valley plain between the hosts
245,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Of Israel and Philistia. And on this day
246,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Jonathan learnt utter reproach, and love."
247,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"There on the plain Goliath stood alone,"
248,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Poised in his mighty bulk, with black locks flowing,"
249,DAVID AND JONATHAN,A handsbreadth taller even than Saul the king
250,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Who shouldered it above the men of Israel,"
251,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And beat his words of sure defiance out,"
252,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Ringing across the windless noon. And all
253,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Israel heard, and fear was on them, knowing,"
254,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"If thus the issue, how it should prevail."
255,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And Jonathan in the tent of Saul his father,"
256,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Watched, and his blood was quick, and in his mind"
257,DAVID AND JONATHAN,He strove against the last of doubt. And then
258,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"The young man David stood before them, bidden"
259,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"By Saul, who heard one say, ""There is a boy"
260,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"New come from tending sheep in Bethlehem,"
261,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And seeks the king."" And David stood before them,"
262,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And asked no leave, but said, ""There was a cause."
263,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"It bade me come, and I will fight with him."""
264,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And Saul denied, but David did not hear"
265,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Denial, saying, ""the wild beasts of the field"
266,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"I with my hand have slain at the fold's gate,"
267,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And this is mine to do."" And David stood,"
268,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Greater than argument while Saul armed him there.
269,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And Jonathan saw the purpose that he was not,"
270,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Glowing and bodied, and his love was born."
271,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
272,DAVID AND JONATHAN,.....
273,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
274,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Then David flung the armour off, and said,"
275,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"""I am David, and I know not these strange arms."
276,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"I must go out as I have always been,"
277,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Not girt with new occasion. It is I,"
278,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"David the shepherd that am David still,"
279,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And I know nothing of your spears and plate.
280,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"A sheepskin have I worn, and in my hand"
281,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"A sling, and pebbles taken from the brook."
282,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Now shall I go, content that God has watched me"
283,DAVID AND JONATHAN,So habited and armed through all my youth.
284,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Should I pretend another David now,"
285,DAVID AND JONATHAN,I should meet this man with neither honour nor hope.
286,DAVID AND JONATHAN,If I am sent against the Philistine
287,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Out of God's anger, and I know it is so,"
288,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"It is not one the chosen of Saul's hosts,"
289,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"But I, David of Bethlehem must go,"
290,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"The son of Jesse, and keeper of his flocks."""
291,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
292,DAVID AND JONATHAN,.....
293,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
294,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Almost the tears were seen in Jonathan's eyes,"
295,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Because of David's words, of which he knew"
296,DAVID AND JONATHAN,The poor ghosts hiding somewhere in his own heart.
297,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And then he spoke his fear, and then the words,"
298,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Resting his sword, ""I love him. Let him go."""
299,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And David stept out of the emerald light
300,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"That played up from the grass floor of the tent,"
301,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Into the full flood of the April noon,"
302,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And walked a little way, and those two stood"
303,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Parted a hundred paces, the man of terror,"
304,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Hewn massy and with shock of builded limbs,"
305,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And David moulded like a sea boy risen
306,DAVID AND JONATHAN,From caves of music where the water spins
307,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Wet sand into the shapes of flowing flowers;
308,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"David with limbs all bright with the sun's tones,"
309,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And ruddy locks curling with youth and light,"
310,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"His body all alert on steady loins,"
311,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Clean spun of flesh that knew the winter snows,"
312,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And mellow pools of summer, and the dews"
313,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Dropping among the crocuses of dawn.
314,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"His sandle-straps bound ankles as a girl's,"
315,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And fluttering to his knees the sheepskin hung,"
316,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Cloaking one shoulder, while the other gleamed."
317,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And there he paused, the sling in his right hand,"
318,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"His left hand fingering the pouch of pebbles,"
319,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"While Israel fearing murmured, and the hosts"
320,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Of Philistine derision rocked the noon.
321,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Then did Goliath cry, ""Am I a dog,"
322,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"For a boy's whipping? Have you not a man,"
323,DAVID AND JONATHAN,That you would send a cleaner up of crumbs
324,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"From the queen's table? Come then, and be broken,"
325,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"For birds to find you and the dogs at night."""
326,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And Jonathan heard Philistia shout again,"
327,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And David, like a flame unwinded, stood"
328,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Quivering at the cry, and laid a stone"
329,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"In the sling's fold, and cast his staff, and ran,"
330,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Fleet as the king bird gliding under leaves,"
331,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Towards Goliath. And a giant spear
332,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Swung from the Philistine hand, and forty paces"
333,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Sang in the air and brushed the flying sheepskin,"
334,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And sudden David's feet were planted firm,"
335,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Locked on the earth, and circling in the sun"
336,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"The tight thong flashed and loosened, and the stone"
337,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Smote the Philistine wrath above the eyes,"
338,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And the day was clouded from him, and he fell."
339,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
340,DAVID AND JONATHAN,.....
341,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
342,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Then Israel spared not. And, when night was come,"
343,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Jonathan sent for David to his tent,"
344,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And those two sat while the yellow torches burned,"
345,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And Jonathan spoke and said, ""David, my brother,"
346,DAVID AND JONATHAN,To-day you have made a story that shall be
347,DAVID AND JONATHAN,For ever fruitful in the heart of man.
348,DAVID AND JONATHAN,This day is David's. But of this day I too
349,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Share, not in the honour, but in the harvesting,"
350,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Or the harvesting I think is wholly mine.
351,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Shall I speak on?"" And David said, ""Speak on."""
352,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Then Jonathan--""This morning there was a man,"
353,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And it was Jonathan, who many years"
354,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Had gone snared in a purpose not his own,"
355,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"That is, not truly mine. Always I knew,"
356,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Walking by that self I said was honest,"
357,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Another self, the true self, in a shadow,"
358,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Or at an angle that my eyes refused.
359,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"I was a proud man, David, very virtuous,"
360,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Or, in fairness to myself, desiring virtue,"
361,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Truly desiring it, I may say that."
362,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And yet even in that desire there moved
363,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"A lie, for I knew the virtue of my desire"
364,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Was something tainted. No--I knew it not,"
365,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"But that other self walking beside me knew it,"
366,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And whispered, I knew, a thing that I would not hear."
367,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Always it whispered, as I stood alone,"
368,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"I said, in subtle thought among all Israel."
369,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"God had spoken to me, David, that the Philistine"
370,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Was evil, evil, that was all God said,"
371,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And bade me strike as a man by God assured.
372,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"But the man to whom God spoke I put aside,"
373,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"The still self walking, whispering, in the shadow."
374,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And I, the Jonathan of daily light,"
375,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Tempered the word of God, I tempered it--"
376,DAVID AND JONATHAN,I who should be God's outcast doing so.
377,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"I counted evil twenty different ways,"
378,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And none of them plain evil. I diced with God,"
379,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And the dice fell as often to my hand,"
380,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"It seemed, as His, but falling so the whisper"
381,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Was ever shadowed at my ear, unheard."
382,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And ever as this new intelligence,"
383,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"This pride of thought, crept over me and filled"
384,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"My dawn and noon and sleep, a hunger grew,"
385,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"A dreadful hunger for that self denied,"
386,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And every word I spoke for righteousness
387,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Turned bitter on my lips, because I knew"
388,DAVID AND JONATHAN,That every word was righteousness undone.
389,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Such was the man this morning when you came,"
390,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Who from the king's tent watched you, David. Then"
391,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Change and completion and I know not what
392,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Of heavenly fulfilment fell upon me.
393,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Not from myself, nor of my own devising,"
394,DAVID AND JONATHAN,But marvellously spoken in a space
395,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Of golden light that glowed about the form
396,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Of a boy standing in my father's tent.
397,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Quite suddenly the thing I lacked was there,"
398,DAVID AND JONATHAN,The shadow whispering at my side had gone
399,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And stood there bodied in you, David, brother,"
400,DAVID AND JONATHAN,O dear young shepherd from your sheepfolds called--
401,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Nay Jonathan myself it was there standing,"
402,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Or barren branches of myself in flower,"
403,DAVID AND JONATHAN,My jailored thought flooded with light of song.
404,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And in that moment nothing was between
405,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Your soul and mine, and knowing you, I loved,"
406,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Since love is understanding, and must come"
407,DAVID AND JONATHAN,When mind looks on the presence of very mind.
408,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"I loved you, David, and I love, and ever--"
409,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Because my mind, even in one day's passing,"
410,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Has learnt you as no years could better learn--
411,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"My love is fixed upon you. And, moreover,"
412,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Since from this hour I must for ever know
413,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Some element of me lodged sole in you,"
414,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Some certainty in you alone to be
415,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Among my weeds the patient husbandman,"
416,DAVID AND JONATHAN,I must in your love prosper or not at all.
417,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Now therefore, David, let a covenant be"
418,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Between us from this day, for the heart knows."""
419,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
420,DAVID AND JONATHAN,.....
421,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
422,DAVID AND JONATHAN,David and Jonathan under the long torches
423,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Were silent then. And David's eyes were fixed
424,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Long upon Jonathan, as eyes may sometimes look"
425,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"On eyes, and see no face, looking beyond"
426,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Into unimaged life, into the brain"
427,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Moving behind the circumstance of flesh,"
428,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Eyes that to-morrow passing might hardly know
429,DAVID AND JONATHAN,The mere face that to-night they gaze upon.
430,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And Jonathan having spoken, waited there"
431,DAVID AND JONATHAN,While David searched him slowly with still eyes.
432,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Then David rose, and drew the tent-fold back,"
433,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And looked upon the stars of Palestine
434,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Long, and a mallow moon; and Jonathan waited."
435,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Then David came again, and spoke, ""I too,"
436,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Standing this morning in your father's tent,"
437,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Knew that a life unwonted was near me there.
438,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And now you have spoken, and the love you say,"
439,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"I know, and as your will is so is mine."
440,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Something I am for you that none can be.
441,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Let it be so, but all is not then said."
442,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"This morning when I smote the Philistine,"
443,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"I was God's purpose, that I must believe."
444,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"But purpose only is not all of God,"
445,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Hearing you now, I know it is not all."
446,DAVID AND JONATHAN,When first I saw you I did not know it then--
447,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Only, facing the Philistine, something new"
448,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"A moment marked me, and unnoted went,"
449,DAVID AND JONATHAN,No touch of it upon my will. But now
450,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"I have heard you speak, and what it was I know."
451,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"You loved me, Jonathan, seeing, as I stood,"
452,DAVID AND JONATHAN,That shadowy self of you of which you tell me
453,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Suddenly living fearless in the sun.
454,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"That is your reaping of my field, and I"
455,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Glory to give it you. But were that all,"
456,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Proud to be loved, I should not love again."
457,DAVID AND JONATHAN,But now I know for me is too a reaping.
458,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Your shadow to my living purpose leaps,"
459,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And that is wonderful. But as you spoke
460,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Some David hidden from the man that slew
461,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Goliath listened also, and is now"
462,DAVID AND JONATHAN,With us for ever. And he that wrought this life
463,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Is you, Jonathan of doubts and speculation,"
464,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"The man who sits there plainly now, the mere"
465,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Jonathan when the shadow is forgotten.
466,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Now do I know my purpose magnified,"
467,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Sure as of old, but learning in its flight,"
468,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Of pity and the sad heart of man from you,"
469,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And how the jealous and unmerciful,"
470,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Being stricken down, are but poor sorrows too."
471,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"So, Jonathan my brother, as you take,"
472,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"So do you give, and in us now shall be"
473,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"The perfect whole of purpose and compassion,"
474,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And resolution without pride of heart.
475,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Now therefore will I make the covenant,"
476,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Knowing that never more can you or I
477,DAVID AND JONATHAN,Without this love be better than a tale
478,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Of corrupting seed and fallow-lands unsown."""
479,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
480,DAVID AND JONATHAN,.....
481,DAVID AND JONATHAN,
482,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Now Jonathan rose and put the torches out,"
483,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And a grey beam of dawn was on those two.
484,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And Jonathan took his outer garment off,"
485,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Which was the king's son's, and robed David there,"
486,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And he took the sword that Saul had given him,"
487,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"Belted in gold and cased in figured steel,"
488,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And it hung on David's loins. And Jonathan said,"
489,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"""Who fails in this, that is the last betrayal,"
490,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"The quenching of the holy spirit of God."""
491,DAVID AND JONATHAN,"And David said, ""So be it."" And they embraced,"
492,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And kissed. And David went into the dawn.
493,DAVID AND JONATHAN,And Jonathan watched until the day was full.
494,DAVID AND JONATHAN,

497,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE
498,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,
499,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"That was the proud woman, Naaman's wife."
500,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Basking at noon under the Syrian fans,"
501,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"While Naaman, the leprous mighty captain,"
502,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Proud glowing flesh now silver-skinned and tainted,"
503,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Walked in contagion here and there, apart."
504,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"His wife, the unblemished Naaman in her mind,"
505,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"The man who, coming with the spoils and shouts,"
506,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Had made a hundred triumphs hers, when all"
507,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"The Syrian women courted her for that,"
508,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Now saw in the pestilent limbs shame and reproach,"
509,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Some treachery that made her, who was mate"
510,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Of Syria's pride, bondwoman of a leper."
511,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"She must nurse her blame, since he was Naaman still,"
512,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"With an old honour paid by stedfastness,"
513,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,The mark of Syria's compassion. Black
514,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Thoughts were her only payment for betrayal,"
515,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"But in secret she could play them without pity,--"
516,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Let the fans beat, they could not beguile her from that."
517,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,
518,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,.....
519,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,
520,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And Naaman had loved her, but not now,"
521,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Knowing the uses that his love had been,"
522,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,How given for her to squander it in pride.
523,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,
524,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,.....
525,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,
526,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Syria out of Israel had brought
527,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Captives, and among them one, a maid,"
528,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"A little maid, just troubled with the touch"
529,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Of womanhood upon her body and thought,"
530,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And she served Naaman's wife, a lonely girl,"
531,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"To answer bidding, and covet little tones"
532,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Of kindness that she heard go to and fro,"
533,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,But not for her. She trembled as she stood
534,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"At the proud woman's couch, because a fault"
535,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,In orders done meant scolding and even rods.
536,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And she had but two joys. One, to remember"
537,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"A Galilean town, and the blue waters"
538,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"That washed the pebbles that she knew so well,"
539,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Yellow in sunlight, or frozen in the moon,"
540,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"A little curve of beach, where she would walk"
541,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,At any hour with an old silver man.
542,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Her father's father, her sole companion,"
543,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Who told her tales of Moses and the prophets
544,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,That lived in the old days. And of that time
545,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"She had but now poor treasuries of the mind,"
546,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Little seclusions when, the day's work done,"
547,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,She made thought into prayer before she slept;
548,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"These, and a faded gown that she had brought"
549,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Into captivity, patterned with sprigs of thyme,"
550,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And blades of wheat, and little curling shells,"
551,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And signs of heaven figured out in stars,"
552,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Made by a weaver that her grandsire knew,"
553,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"A gift on some thanksgiving. She might not wear it,"
554,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Being suited as became a slave, but often"
555,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"At night she would spread it in her loneliness,"
556,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And think how finely she too might be drest,"
557,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"As finely as any proud woman of them all,"
558,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,If the God of Israel had not visited her
559,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Surely for sin, though she could not remember."
560,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Thus one joy was. And then the Lord Naaman,"
561,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"This wonder soiled, this pitiful great captain"
562,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Forbidden all that he had so proudly been--
563,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"To worship him, that was her other joy."
564,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"When the dusk came, and the city fell to silence,"
565,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And out of his poor banishment he would walk,"
566,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"She followed him, knowing the very hour,"
567,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And all her heart was flooded through with pity,"
568,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Because she knew the leprosy left still
569,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,A Naaman untainted and lovely.
570,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Then in her mind was the proud woman a loathing,"
571,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Who dared to waste a marvel such as this,"
572,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,The right in the world's knowledge so to love.
573,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"O pitiful evil blasting so great a flesh,"
574,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Walling a spirit so governing itself
575,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,In spite of desolation. A maid's thought thus
576,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Knew how the frames of mastery can suffer.
577,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,
578,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,.....
579,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,
580,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Sometimes at night when not even lepers walked,"
581,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Solitary in the Syrian meadows she
582,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Would wander in the old perplexity
583,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"That the moon makes of love. Never, she knew,"
584,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Could any adoration that she brought
585,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Touch even the Lord Naaman's banishment,"
586,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,The Naaman fallen from the time when even
587,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Great ladies dare not speak the thing they felt.
588,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"She was nothing, or the world could never know"
589,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,If she was more than nothing; a maid to bind
590,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Tresses for beauty that was not her own.
591,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And yet she knew that she had beauty too,"
592,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,A little hermit beauty that might spend
593,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Royally if it dare and a man would speak,--"
594,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Royally, Naaman, but he could not hear."
595,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"But still for all the silence of her lips,"
596,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And heart with promise nothing known, she loved--"
597,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Loved the sad leper walking in the dusk,"
598,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Loved the great lord, loved even his leprosy,"
599,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Since by it he came a little down to her,"
600,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Loved him, and knew that her love was the sum"
601,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Of all that loving, and must be. But even so,"
602,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,She knew her love an honester thing than any
603,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"That the proud woman had. O moon, she thought,"
604,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Could you not make me truly tell this love,"
605,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"This love pulsing along my blood and brain,"
606,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,As midnight surges going through the sky?
607,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,And long she pondered how she best might serve.
608,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,
609,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,.....
610,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,
611,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Then one day when the fans moved, and she stood"
612,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Ministering with her perfumes at the couch,"
613,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Her mistress, with eyes that meant the thought was nothing,"
614,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Said, ""Is it not grievous that my lord goes thus?"""
615,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,And the maid felt the colour at her throat
616,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Flow round her neck and flood up to her temples,"
617,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"But knowing, feared not, or put her fear aside,"
618,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And said ""Would God my lord were in Samaria,"
619,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"To seek Elisha there, a prophet, lady,"
620,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Whom God hath taught to cure whom he will cure."""
621,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"She spoke, and the bright bowl trembled in her hands,"
622,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,And fear because of her words made the tongue dry
623,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,As the woman looked with still cold eyes upon her.
624,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"But the word passed from lip to lip, and the king"
625,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Heard it, and sent for Naaman and said,"
626,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"""A girl among the slaves that you brought in"
627,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"From Israel has spoken a strange thing,"
628,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Of one Elisha, a prophet whom they obey,"
629,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Saying that he could bid the blemish off
630,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,That is cheating Syria of her proudest man.
631,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Now therefore journey to him, and I will send"
632,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Word to Israel's king, that he shall bless"
633,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Favours from us in whom his fortune lies,"
634,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Bidding him call this prophet to your cause.
635,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Go, and the love of Syria go with you."""
636,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,
637,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,.....
638,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,
639,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Then Naaman with his servants went at dawn,"
640,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,And Naaman's wife saw how again might come
641,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Her mastery among the women of Syria.
642,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Yet was the little maid her hatred now,"
643,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Lest of her word should come this resurrection.
644,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And Naaman went, and Israel's king was glad,"
645,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Because of Syria's favour, and sent down"
646,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,The hill to where Elisha lived among
647,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Farmers of flax and goatherds and a few
648,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Unhappy men who brought their sorrow to God,"
649,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Asking his mercy on the Syrian lord.
650,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And Naaman stood before the prophet of Israel,"
651,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And told his grief. And Elisha looked upon him,"
652,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Measured his faith, and bade him bathe his body"
653,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Seven times in the river of Jordan, and be"
654,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Whole. And Naaman questioned, and was wrath,"
655,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,As was not any river of Damascus
656,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Purer than Jordan, and in more virtue flowing?"
657,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"But, little, his servants said, was this to do,"
658,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And, as persuasion led him, he went down"
659,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And seven times let Jordan cover him,"
660,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And came with a clean body as of old,"
661,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"A strong man with the tides of blood before him,"
662,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"With equal limbs for all the spirit could dare,"
663,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,And into Syria he sang upon his riding.
664,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,
665,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,.....
666,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,
667,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And tidings came to the Syrian king of this,"
668,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Heralding a Naaman mightier than ever,"
669,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"With clean flesh and a wisdom all matured,"
670,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And all the city rang upon his coming,"
671,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"The king and his estate, people and priests,"
672,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,And soldiers glad of their old captain again.
673,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And matrons with their girls, and the rich merchants,"
674,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"All shouted Naaman, Naaman, through the streets."
675,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And Naaman's wife stood at the king's right hand,"
676,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Her slave-borne canopy coloured and spangled,"
677,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"While the great fans beat upon her pride again,"
678,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,And Naaman in plumes and plate and mail
679,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Again was master of the Syrian hosts.
680,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,
681,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,.....
682,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,
683,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Afar, beyond the barriers of the streets,"
684,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Pressing among the crowd for a moment's seeing,"
685,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"The Israelitish maid, between her duties,"
686,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,Watched with a proud flush beating down her limbs.
687,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And shyly she had on a faded gown,"
688,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Patterned with sprigs of thyme and blades of wheat,"
689,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,And paling stars and little curling shells.
690,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And as the shouting rose, she watched in silence,"
691,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"With trembling lips, and Naaman passed by her,"
692,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And her hands moved towards him, and fell down,"
693,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Then stole upon her bosom, as they would ease"
694,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,The aching beauty of her loneliness.
695,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And there unnoted as he passed she stood,"
696,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,With not a thought from all that world upon her.
697,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"Only, when service came again, she saw"
698,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,A glowing hatred in the proud woman's eyes.
699,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,"And in the night she thought of it, and wept,"
700,THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE,But not for any hatred were her tears.

704,LAKE WINTER,LAKE WINTER
705,LAKE WINTER,
706,LAKE WINTER,Full summer dusk was round him as he stood
707,LAKE WINTER,"On the hill-top, over the calling sheep"
708,LAKE WINTER,Drifting along the pastured downs. The moon
709,LAKE WINTER,Far off was rising from the Sussex sea.
710,LAKE WINTER,"Above him, building up into the sky,"
711,LAKE WINTER,"Black, and with pointing sails now skeletoned,"
712,LAKE WINTER,A windmill gathered strays of evening wind
713,LAKE WINTER,Whispering through the splitting timbers. Still
714,LAKE WINTER,The setting sun washed with a fuller gold
715,LAKE WINTER,The golden sheaves patterned upon a cone
716,LAKE WINTER,Of downland by him farther from the sea.
717,LAKE WINTER,"So still, he seemed a thing woven of earth,"
718,LAKE WINTER,A life rooted and fixed as were the oaks
719,LAKE WINTER,"Locked in the soil, their bases webbed with fleece"
720,LAKE WINTER,"Of sheltering ewes, he watched across the valley,"
721,LAKE WINTER,"And the hour passed, and the black mill grew and grew,"
722,LAKE WINTER,And then a light came in a far window
723,LAKE WINTER,"Of a grey farm cresting the hill beyond,"
724,LAKE WINTER,And sudden tides beat on him as he saw
725,LAKE WINTER,A white dress moving in the distant pines.
726,LAKE WINTER,
727,LAKE WINTER,.....
728,LAKE WINTER,
729,LAKE WINTER,"Lake Winter, a five hundred acre man,"
730,LAKE WINTER,"Was English, bred far back, a part of England,"
731,LAKE WINTER,With South and North and Midland in his blood.
732,LAKE WINTER,"And somewhere Devon, somewhere Suffolk too."
733,LAKE WINTER,"He had been born of love. They had been lovers,"
734,LAKE WINTER,"Who made him, and no more, but they were lovers."
735,LAKE WINTER,"She of a proud house, proud to make it prouder"
736,LAKE WINTER,"With wit and beauty, and a young brain glowing,"
737,LAKE WINTER,And a swift body fearless and pitiful;
738,LAKE WINTER,"And he a Cotswold yeoman, thrift and power,"
739,LAKE WINTER,"And mastery of earth and herds and flocks,"
740,LAKE WINTER,"And knowledge of all seasons and their fruits,"
741,LAKE WINTER,"And a heart of meditation, all his birthright;"
742,LAKE WINTER,Ten generations deep from Gloucester stone.
743,LAKE WINTER,"And those two met, and loved, and of their love"
744,LAKE WINTER,"Came a new purity of blood and limb,"
745,LAKE WINTER,As of a purpose slowly moulding them.
746,LAKE WINTER,"And long they waited, and then one summer noon,"
747,LAKE WINTER,"He, coming northward from his Cotswold home,"
748,LAKE WINTER,"Found her by Rydal as she had bidden him,"
749,LAKE WINTER,"And proudly stride to stride they took the road,"
750,LAKE WINTER,"Sure youth by youth, and to Helvellyn's foot"
751,LAKE WINTER,"They came, and climbed up to the brighter air,"
752,LAKE WINTER,"And into the wind's ardour still went on,"
753,LAKE WINTER,"Until upon the mountain top they stood,"
754,LAKE WINTER,And lake by lake was fading in the dusk.
755,LAKE WINTER,Out of the plains they saw the moon move up
756,LAKE WINTER,"And over them the deeper blue came on,"
757,LAKE WINTER,The faint stars glowing into mastery.
758,LAKE WINTER,"And in that splendour of a summer hill,"
759,LAKE WINTER,"Amid the mellow-breathing night, where yet"
760,LAKE WINTER,"The poppies of the valley could not come,"
761,LAKE WINTER,There was conceived a boy....
762,LAKE WINTER,And sorrow came
763,LAKE WINTER,Upon their love. Before the moon again
764,LAKE WINTER,"Was full upon Helvellyn, the Cotswold lover"
765,LAKE WINTER,"With a great elm was blasted in a storm,"
766,LAKE WINTER,"And lay, a burnt thing, in a Cotswold grave."
767,LAKE WINTER,"And she went out, took her inheritance,"
768,LAKE WINTER,"And lived apart, and the man-child was born."
769,LAKE WINTER,"She called him Lake, for those fading lakes of dusk,"
770,LAKE WINTER,And gave him her own name. And twenty years
771,LAKE WINTER,"She tended him, and died; and from her substance"
772,LAKE WINTER,Lake Winter now for fifteen years had kept
773,LAKE WINTER,His Sussex acres in fertility.
774,LAKE WINTER,"Such was the man, so born, so passionately made,"
775,LAKE WINTER,"So knit of English earth and generations,"
776,LAKE WINTER,Who now upon the summer evening watched--
777,LAKE WINTER,His manhood full upon his middle years--
778,LAKE WINTER,A white dress moving in the distant pines.
779,LAKE WINTER,
780,LAKE WINTER,.....
781,LAKE WINTER,
782,LAKE WINTER,"Down to the valley from their hills they came,"
783,LAKE WINTER,Lake Winter and the woman that he loved.
784,LAKE WINTER,"He waited by a long brown garden wall,"
785,LAKE WINTER,"Mottled with moss and lichen, where in the dusk"
786,LAKE WINTER,"Like a great moth a late flycatcher wove,"
787,LAKE WINTER,"And watched her coming down a rutted path,"
788,LAKE WINTER,"Towards him. And the flowing of her body,"
789,LAKE WINTER,"Sure step through fugitive cadences of limb,"
790,LAKE WINTER,"Up to the little golden arch of hair,"
791,LAKE WINTER,Was lovely as a known yet wanted tale.
792,LAKE WINTER,
793,LAKE WINTER,.....
794,LAKE WINTER,
795,LAKE WINTER,"Zell Dane, the wife of Martin Dane, who held"
796,LAKE WINTER,"Tollington Manor farm, was ten years wed."
797,LAKE WINTER,"Dane was an honest man by groom and horse,"
798,LAKE WINTER,"Paid pew-rent and his losing wagers, thought"
799,LAKE WINTER,"The British Empire lived at Westminster,"
800,LAKE WINTER,"Stood by the State and rights of property,"
801,LAKE WINTER,"Drank well, and knew the barmaids of a county."
802,LAKE WINTER,"He married Zell, and neither could have said"
803,LAKE WINTER,"Why it was done. Ten years had gone since then,"
804,LAKE WINTER,"And he was now a half forgotten habit,"
805,LAKE WINTER,"She, some queer porcelain stuff beyond his knowing."
806,LAKE WINTER,
807,LAKE WINTER,.....
808,LAKE WINTER,
809,LAKE WINTER,"Lake Winter came and went at Tollington,"
810,LAKE WINTER,"As other neighbours, a little in Dane's mind"
811,LAKE WINTER,"Suspect for certain rumours of his birth,"
812,LAKE WINTER,"But known for a straight rider and plain speaker,"
813,LAKE WINTER,Who meant his words and had words for his meaning.
814,LAKE WINTER,"And Lake and Zell, between the jests at table,"
815,LAKE WINTER,"Where they could match the best wits of the room,"
816,LAKE WINTER,Would talk of things that Dane and the rest counted
817,LAKE WINTER,As pointing ways not good for level minds.
818,LAKE WINTER,"Why pose about Beethoven, and Debussy,"
819,LAKE WINTER,"Or these French fellows Degas and Picasso,"
820,LAKE WINTER,"When there were Marcus Stone, and A Long, Long Trail,"
821,LAKE WINTER,"And ""A Little Grey Home in the West,"" that common folk"
822,LAKE WINTER,"Could understand? And, however the truth might be,"
823,LAKE WINTER,It wasn't decent openly to say
824,LAKE WINTER,That William Wordsworth was a better poet--
825,LAKE WINTER,Though more or less in a poet was no matter--
826,LAKE WINTER,Because it seemed that once in his flaming youth
827,LAKE WINTER,He had loved gloriously in France....
828,LAKE WINTER,
829,LAKE WINTER,. . . . .
830,LAKE WINTER,
831,LAKE WINTER,"Dane heard and saw,"
832,LAKE WINTER,And was a little troubled that clear heads
833,LAKE WINTER,"Should cloud and squander thus, a little scornful."
834,LAKE WINTER,"Still if it gave them pleasure, and it but meant"
835,LAKE WINTER,"Mind with mind idling together so,"
836,LAKE WINTER,"Winter could come and go for all he cared,"
837,LAKE WINTER,"He wouldn't grudge ... and then the doubt began,"
838,LAKE WINTER,A thought that somewhere under all this play
839,LAKE WINTER,"And nimbleness was crouching the true thing,"
840,LAKE WINTER,"Lust, plain lust. There was between man and woman,"
841,LAKE WINTER,"So Dane had learnt, two several conditions,"
842,LAKE WINTER,"A compact to keep smooth the day's affairs,"
843,LAKE WINTER,"That, and plain lust. This mind play was a sham...."
844,LAKE WINTER,"Winter and Zell were lusting, that was all..."
845,LAKE WINTER,"Then let them... damn it, let the matter be..."
846,LAKE WINTER,"Time would show all, and there were crops and hounds."
847,LAKE WINTER,
848,LAKE WINTER,....
849,LAKE WINTER,
850,LAKE WINTER,They stood together by the dusky wall.
851,LAKE WINTER,"And long their lips met, in a hushed world fading,"
852,LAKE WINTER,A night of beauty fading in their own.
853,LAKE WINTER,"And then ""I made a rhyme for you to-day,"
854,LAKE WINTER,"When the last sheaves were binding I made it,"
855,LAKE WINTER,"thus--"""
856,LAKE WINTER,
857,LAKE WINTER,"I have no strange or subtle thought,"
858,LAKE WINTER,"And the old things are best,"
859,LAKE WINTER,"In curious tongues I am untaught,"
860,LAKE WINTER,Yet I know rest.
861,LAKE WINTER,
862,LAKE WINTER,I know the sifting oakleaves still
863,LAKE WINTER,"Upon a twilit sky,"
864,LAKE WINTER,I hear the fernowl on the hill
865,LAKE WINTER,Go wheeling by.
866,LAKE WINTER,
867,LAKE WINTER,I know my flocks and how they keep
868,LAKE WINTER,"Their tunes of field and fold,"
869,LAKE WINTER,"My scholarship can sow and reap,"
870,LAKE WINTER,From green to gold.
871,LAKE WINTER,
872,LAKE WINTER,The circled stars from down to sea
873,LAKE WINTER,"I reckon as my gains,"
874,LAKE WINTER,The swallows are as dear to me
875,LAKE WINTER,As loaded wains.
876,LAKE WINTER,
877,LAKE WINTER,"Yet these were ghosts and fugitive,"
878,LAKE WINTER,Until upon your step they came
879,LAKE WINTER,By revelation's lips to live
880,LAKE WINTER,In your dear name.
881,LAKE WINTER,
882,LAKE WINTER,"I saw you walking as dusk fell,"
883,LAKE WINTER,And leaves and wains and heaven and birds
884,LAKE WINTER,"Were miracles my blood may tell,"
885,LAKE WINTER,And not my words.
886,LAKE WINTER,
887,LAKE WINTER,"""And yet I would not lose the tidings come"
888,LAKE WINTER,"On so dear words, though the blood knows it all,"
889,LAKE WINTER,"As the song says."" She spoke; and from the valley"
890,LAKE WINTER,"Slowly towards the mill, by ghostly flocks"
891,LAKE WINTER,"That stole about the meadows of the moonrise,"
892,LAKE WINTER,"They walked, and made this argument of love."
893,LAKE WINTER,
894,LAKE WINTER,"LAKE. How shall they stand for wisdom, who forbid"
895,LAKE WINTER,"The body's love, which is so small a thing,"
896,LAKE WINTER,"Yet let the souls, or minds, or what you will"
897,LAKE WINTER,"Be mated, as though spirit were the drudge,"
898,LAKE WINTER,"For no-one's heed, and limbs alone to be,"
899,LAKE WINTER,"As though clay were the gold, inviolate?"
900,LAKE WINTER,"If I could grudge love coming anywhere,"
901,LAKE WINTER,"Falling even on whom I loved in all,"
902,LAKE WINTER,I think the body at least should have no share
903,LAKE WINTER,"Of jealousy from me, which should be spent"
904,LAKE WINTER,"Rather on minds meeting above my own,"
905,LAKE WINTER,Myself an exile from their understanding.
906,LAKE WINTER,"Beloved, in the mating of our minds"
907,LAKE WINTER,"I am all peace to walk thus in your presence,"
908,LAKE WINTER,"And in that peace your body of my desire,"
909,LAKE WINTER,"And all my earth, as passionate as any,"
910,LAKE WINTER,"Seem snares to tempt us to the loss of all,"
911,LAKE WINTER,"Since by them the world threatens this our peace,"
912,LAKE WINTER,"Which else we may so gather, undenied."
913,LAKE WINTER,"Then is not flesh merely the trouble of love,"
914,LAKE WINTER,"When love goes thus, as love between us now?"
915,LAKE WINTER,
916,LAKE WINTER,.....
917,LAKE WINTER,
918,LAKE WINTER,"Zell took his hand, and her life was in his veins,"
919,LAKE WINTER,And his words beat back upon him as she spoke.
920,LAKE WINTER,
921,LAKE WINTER,.....
922,LAKE WINTER,
923,LAKE WINTER,"ZELL. Dear, you are wise of all your books, and speech"
924,LAKE WINTER,"Of windy downs, and polities of men,"
925,LAKE WINTER,"And the old passions weaving history,"
926,LAKE WINTER,"And strong and gentle things of sea and earth,"
927,LAKE WINTER,"And the poor passing of the life of man,"
928,LAKE WINTER,But not in this. You have your great-heart courage
929,LAKE WINTER,For all such ardours as might make you seem
930,LAKE WINTER,"Some fabled hero standing against fate,"
931,LAKE WINTER,But not in this. In sifting vanity
932,LAKE WINTER,"From the right honour, and building from ambition,"
933,LAKE WINTER,"You have a vision constant as the tides,"
934,LAKE WINTER,But not in this. They may look Sussex over
935,LAKE WINTER,For any man who found a crooked word
936,LAKE WINTER,"Ever upon your lips, and vainly look,"
937,LAKE WINTER,"Because, dear, truth is an old habit in you,"
938,LAKE WINTER,"But not in this. Here in the night enchanted,"
939,LAKE WINTER,"With not an ear to catch the whispered truth,"
940,LAKE WINTER,Let nothing but the truth between us be--
941,LAKE WINTER,"I love you, Lake; I love the fair mind moving"
942,LAKE WINTER,In equal joy among men's praise or censure;
943,LAKE WINTER,"I love the courage of its lonely flight,"
944,LAKE WINTER,Here in a land of light convenience.
945,LAKE WINTER,I love you for the years that you have given
946,LAKE WINTER,To Sussex plough and pasture till they are grown
947,LAKE WINTER,Surer and richer in your wit than any.
948,LAKE WINTER,I love you for the love in which you gather
949,LAKE WINTER,"My mind that from youth on has gone unmated,"
950,LAKE WINTER,And then I love you for the bearing kept
951,LAKE WINTER,In you when slight occasions something royal
952,LAKE WINTER,Take on because you silently are there.
953,LAKE WINTER,"I know you, Lake, for a man worthy honour,"
954,LAKE WINTER,And well to honour is well to delight.
955,LAKE WINTER,"But, dear, with all this giving of my love,"
956,LAKE WINTER,"Great and unmeasured giving, sending back"
957,LAKE WINTER,"In joy the worship that you bring to me,"
958,LAKE WINTER,"I love your glowing body, and you love mine."
959,LAKE WINTER,"No words, or thrift of philosophic thought,"
960,LAKE WINTER,Can put that love out of the love we are.
961,LAKE WINTER,"At night, alone, when the dark covers me,"
962,LAKE WINTER,"I ache for you, body for body I ache."
963,LAKE WINTER,And then I know that over you as well
964,LAKE WINTER,"The dear, forlorn, resistless pain is full."
965,LAKE WINTER,"We may persuade, virtuously persuade,"
966,LAKE WINTER,"That this is but an accident of love,"
967,LAKE WINTER,"Not of love's very being, a thing to bind"
968,LAKE WINTER,"In brave captivity at the world's bidding,"
969,LAKE WINTER,"But I know, as you know it, that persuasion"
970,LAKE WINTER,So made is outcast in the house of truth.
971,LAKE WINTER,"I love you, and the thing I love is made"
972,LAKE WINTER,"All wonderful of flesh and spirit both,"
973,LAKE WINTER,"Body and mind inseparably one,"
974,LAKE WINTER,And I must spend my love on all or nothing.
975,LAKE WINTER,Should I but love those limbs so rightly planned
976,LAKE WINTER,"By ancestry so wise of English earth,"
977,LAKE WINTER,It were a simple harlotry in me.
978,LAKE WINTER,"But, Lake, to love the life and not the house,"
979,LAKE WINTER,The living house so admirably built
980,LAKE WINTER,"Of tissue flawless as the material stars,"
981,LAKE WINTER,"Wherein the life I love is manifest,"
982,LAKE WINTER,Were harlotry no less I know than that.
983,LAKE WINTER,"You, the dear Lake of my idolatry,"
984,LAKE WINTER,"For I am something near it, as you are,"
985,LAKE WINTER,"Are one life, whereto pilgrim thought conspires"
986,LAKE WINTER,"With all the cunning moulding of the flesh,"
987,LAKE WINTER,"And of my brain and body is my love,"
988,LAKE WINTER,"Dream to your dream, desire to your desire."
989,LAKE WINTER,"If you should die, my memory of you"
990,LAKE WINTER,"Would be no tale of the mere mind conceiving,"
991,LAKE WINTER,"Of contemplation thriving thus or thus,"
992,LAKE WINTER,In trance of spaces where not even wings nor breath
993,LAKE WINTER,Recall the moving of substantial things.
994,LAKE WINTER,Rather in me for ever should be glowing
995,LAKE WINTER,"The imaging mind mated in equal limbs,"
996,LAKE WINTER,"Thought visible in lines of the athlete,"
997,LAKE WINTER,Wisdom persuading in the lover's clasp.
998,LAKE WINTER,And how should thought know thought until the whole
999,LAKE WINTER,Of body's beauty is by body learnt?
1000,LAKE WINTER,Until the trial of that most dear seclusion
1001,LAKE WINTER,"Is past, and all the dangers of mere lust"
1002,LAKE WINTER,"Disproved, when in possession is no stale"
1003,LAKE WINTER,"Regret and disillusion, how should be known"
1004,LAKE WINTER,That the still hours of thought with thought are stable
1005,LAKE WINTER,Against the wearing of dissolving time?
1006,LAKE WINTER,"Dear, we must love by all the tokens of love,"
1007,LAKE WINTER,Before the presence of love beyond dispute
1008,LAKE WINTER,Is between us and for ever fixed.
1009,LAKE WINTER,
1010,LAKE WINTER,.....
1011,LAKE WINTER,
1012,LAKE WINTER,"Lake heard, and knew that answer could be none,"
1013,LAKE WINTER,Then by the sheep-tracks on the silver downs
1014,LAKE WINTER,"Silent they walked, and midnight came apace,"
1015,LAKE WINTER,"And by the bases of the mill they went,"
1016,LAKE WINTER,"Close moving, arm by arm, and down again"
1017,LAKE WINTER,"Towards the valley, where again they stood,"
1018,LAKE WINTER,And let their lives beat out upon the night.
1019,LAKE WINTER,"And as they waited on farewell, a form"
1020,LAKE WINTER,"Came up before them, and Martin Dane stood there,"
1021,LAKE WINTER,"And ""by your leave,"" he murmured, and went on."
1022,LAKE WINTER,"Then Zell, ""To-morrow, when the moon is full,"
1023,LAKE WINTER,Meet me beside the mill mound. Martin goes
1024,LAKE WINTER,"To Farnham for the otter hunting."" Lake"
1025,LAKE WINTER,"Took her and kissed, and with no word they parted"
1026,LAKE WINTER,Where the light still looked from the hillside farm
1027,LAKE WINTER,Over the valley to his home. And he
1028,LAKE WINTER,As dreaming passed again by the mill to sleep.
1029,LAKE WINTER,
1030,LAKE WINTER,.....
1031,LAKE WINTER,
1032,LAKE WINTER,"Firmer the mould, surer the flight of boughs,"
1033,LAKE WINTER,"Familiar move the bright plains of the air,"
1034,LAKE WINTER,And newly stedfast the gospel he had known
1035,LAKE WINTER,"Year by year written on his Sussex life,"
1036,LAKE WINTER,"Now seemed to Lake this day. Among his men,"
1037,LAKE WINTER,"All day he drew and pegged the rickyard straw,"
1038,LAKE WINTER,"And piled the barn from floor to the swallows' beam,"
1039,LAKE WINTER,"Brown throated and brown armed, the golden rose"
1040,LAKE WINTER,"Of summer wind glowing upon his face,"
1041,LAKE WINTER,And all the phrasing of his body good.
1042,LAKE WINTER,"And twilight fell on the full harvest home,"
1043,LAKE WINTER,"And the barn doors were closed, and painted wagons"
1044,LAKE WINTER,"Stood empty by the ricks, with sunken wheels"
1045,LAKE WINTER,"Smeared with the fallen husks, and voice was none,"
1046,LAKE WINTER,And silence with the moon was over all.
1047,LAKE WINTER,
1048,LAKE WINTER,.....
1049,LAKE WINTER,
1050,LAKE WINTER,"Lake through the eve walked his familiar paths,"
1051,LAKE WINTER,Counting the labour of his years; the shed
1052,LAKE WINTER,"Where morn and night the cattle came to stall,"
1053,LAKE WINTER,Empty and still now but for the timbering rats;
1054,LAKE WINTER,"The low smooth paven dairy, where the moon"
1055,LAKE WINTER,Now sent a shaft on one full yellow bowl;
1056,LAKE WINTER,"The barn so happily at teeming time again,"
1057,LAKE WINTER,"The rickyard stacked with hurdles by the fence,"
1058,LAKE WINTER,The long loft over plough and wagon teams.
1059,LAKE WINTER,"Among the heavy apple trees he passed,"
1060,LAKE WINTER,"By ledgy sheep track, over the new stubble,"
1061,LAKE WINTER,"Across the valley, and in the shadow kept"
1062,LAKE WINTER,"Of Martin Dane's home hop-yard, and again"
1063,LAKE WINTER,"Back to his own hillside. And in the south,"
1064,LAKE WINTER,"Beyond the moon, over the midnight sea,"
1065,LAKE WINTER,Came up a cloud all heavy with black wind.
1066,LAKE WINTER,
1067,LAKE WINTER,.....
1068,LAKE WINTER,
1069,LAKE WINTER,"Zell by the mill was standing when he came,"
1070,LAKE WINTER,"Now darkly gowned so that she seemed a shadow,"
1071,LAKE WINTER,"Black by the black mill, save for the white face,"
1072,LAKE WINTER,And gold hair and white hands that caught the moonlight.
1073,LAKE WINTER,"Together the wide wooden steps they climbed,"
1074,LAKE WINTER,"By broken treads and splitting rail, and he"
1075,LAKE WINTER,"Lifted the rusted latch, and there within"
1076,LAKE WINTER,"Were folded sacks perished along the seam,"
1077,LAKE WINTER,"Forgotten with the dust, and the bare walls,"
1078,LAKE WINTER,Now weather-broken. Above them a dim light
1079,LAKE WINTER,Showed them a laddered way still up. They came
1080,LAKE WINTER,"Into the high roof chamber, and a rent"
1081,LAKE WINTER,"In the top timbers let the moonlight in,"
1082,LAKE WINTER,"Half moulding to their vision spars and beams,"
1083,LAKE WINTER,"The mill's old ghostly life, and sail-cloth piled"
1084,LAKE WINTER,From the use of generations. A window space
1085,LAKE WINTER,Just from their towery refuge let them look
1086,LAKE WINTER,Over familiar earth now tranced. And Lake
1087,LAKE WINTER,"Saw yet again his roofs and acres loved,"
1088,LAKE WINTER,"Tenderly, as though interpreters"
1089,LAKE WINTER,Of his long care and their good yielding hours
1090,LAKE WINTER,Freshly upon his senses ministered; Zell
1091,LAKE WINTER,"Across the valley saw a lone slumbering light,"
1092,LAKE WINTER,"While from the south the mounting darkness crept,"
1093,LAKE WINTER,"And the wind gathered, moaning upon the mill,"
1094,LAKE WINTER,Filling its frame with a low pulsing breath.
1095,LAKE WINTER,
1096,LAKE WINTER,.....
1097,LAKE WINTER,
1098,LAKE WINTER,And over love the heavenly figures went
1099,LAKE WINTER,In their unchanging change. No longer now
1100,LAKE WINTER,"The moonlight shafted through the torn roof-timbers,"
1101,LAKE WINTER,"And star by star crossed the small field of sky,"
1102,LAKE WINTER,And in those hours of peace that only comes
1103,LAKE WINTER,"With passion mated and of passion born,"
1104,LAKE WINTER,Lake knew within him stirring that far beauty
1105,LAKE WINTER,Of an old starry still Helvellyn night.
1106,LAKE WINTER,And Zell made all the wisdom of her words
1107,LAKE WINTER,"Wisdom of life, so simple and unclouded,"
1108,LAKE WINTER,"Leaving no fume of trouble in the dark,"
1109,LAKE WINTER,Ending for ever the brain's captivity.
1110,LAKE WINTER,
1111,LAKE WINTER,.....
1112,LAKE WINTER,
1113,LAKE WINTER,"They slept. And still the south wind gathered up,"
1114,LAKE WINTER,"Gust upon gust to a full swelling tide,"
1115,LAKE WINTER,"And the great sail-timbers groaned, and blackness fell"
1116,LAKE WINTER,Over the mill that trembled as in pain
1117,LAKE WINTER,Of age now nearly with all quarrels done.
1118,LAKE WINTER,"Along the ridges of the downs it swept,"
1119,LAKE WINTER,"Beating the boughs of ash and elm, a flood"
1120,LAKE WINTER,Of storm exulting in deliverance.
1121,LAKE WINTER,And fury up and down the valleys played
1122,LAKE WINTER,"And rose and spilt and sank upon the hills,"
1123,LAKE WINTER,"And to and fro the thunder bayed, till sudden"
1124,LAKE WINTER,The world about the sleeping lovers shook
1125,LAKE WINTER,"With sounding doom. And Zell, waking, cried out,"
1126,LAKE WINTER,"And he beside her stood, and folded her"
1127,LAKE WINTER,"A moment as from fear, and kissed her, and they turned"
1128,LAKE WINTER,"To go, when from the bases of the mill"
1129,LAKE WINTER,A shrieking as of life being crushed and torn
1130,LAKE WINTER,"Clanged out upon the beating elements,"
1131,LAKE WINTER,"And the hurt timbers, whipped and wrencht, sent up"
1132,LAKE WINTER,"A last fierce wail, and for a moment swayed,"
1133,LAKE WINTER,"Then gave the life up of a hundred years,"
1134,LAKE WINTER,And to the earth the mill plunged in defeat.
1135,LAKE WINTER,
1136,LAKE WINTER,.....
1137,LAKE WINTER,
1138,LAKE WINTER,Sleepers along the hill-top in the night
1139,LAKE WINTER,"Stirred as a ruin above the thunder broke,"
1140,LAKE WINTER,And slept again. And dawn upon a world
1141,LAKE WINTER,Of leaves and downs and sheep washed into brightness
1142,LAKE WINTER,"Came on that Sussex out of a clear sky,"
1143,LAKE WINTER,And on the sea the little ships went on
1144,LAKE WINTER,With sails just filled with a small virgin wind.
1145,LAKE WINTER,And slowly one by one the village came
1146,LAKE WINTER,"To see the old mill that their sires had known,"
1147,LAKE WINTER,"And sires beyond them, blasted in a world"
1148,LAKE WINTER,Where peace was lord as in immortal mood.
1149,LAKE WINTER,They stood and silence kept them until one
1150,LAKE WINTER,"Saw suddenly upon the dawn breeze blown,"
1151,LAKE WINTER,Out from a mound of split and twisted timber
1152,LAKE WINTER,A strand of golden hair. And strong arms worked
1153,LAKE WINTER,Until upon the grass unheeding lay
1154,LAKE WINTER,Those two dear bodies locked in a love that now
1155,LAKE WINTER,Was beyond malice and denial and fear.
1156,LAKE WINTER,
1157,LAKE WINTER,.....
1158,LAKE WINTER,
1159,LAKE WINTER,"And Martin Dane home from his hunting came,"
1160,LAKE WINTER,"And heard, and saw them lying side by side,"
1161,LAKE WINTER,And wondered how could folly pay so much
1162,LAKE WINTER,"For so unsound and gossipy an end,"
1163,LAKE WINTER,"Gave his instructions for a decent grave,"
1164,LAKE WINTER,And found a tap-room topic to his mind.
1165,LAKE WINTER,
1166,LAKE WINTER,.....
1167,LAKE WINTER,
1168,LAKE WINTER,"That night the promise of the dawn was full,"
1169,LAKE WINTER,"And on the broken mill a clear moon shone,"
1170,LAKE WINTER,Silvering all the ways the lovers knew.
1171,LAKE WINTER,"And by the wreck a shadowy figure watched,"
1172,LAKE WINTER,"Half Lake, and half that old Helvellyn lover,"
1173,LAKE WINTER,And on the night a whispered cadence fell--
1174,LAKE WINTER,
1175,LAKE WINTER,"Again in the world, a story has been made,"
1176,LAKE WINTER,"These looked upon beauty unafraid,"
1177,LAKE WINTER,"O these were lovely, these were the great ones, they dared,"
1178,LAKE WINTER,"And denied not, but upon love's bidding fared."
1179,LAKE WINTER,
1180,LAKE WINTER,"Pity them not; they would scorn that as your hate,"
1181,LAKE WINTER,"They knew the voices, they knew the hours that mate"
1182,LAKE WINTER,"With hours beyond all judgment of mankind,"
1183,LAKE WINTER,These were the proud adventurers of the mind.
1184,LAKE WINTER,
1185,LAKE WINTER,Kindled for ever because of them shall be
1186,LAKE WINTER,"A wiser freedom. The long lanes of the sea,"
1187,LAKE WINTER,The golden acres of Sussex shall holy keep
1188,LAKE WINTER,"Their names, their love, their ending. Let them sleep."
1189,LAKE WINTER,
1190,LAKE WINTER,

1192,GOLD,GOLD
1193,GOLD,
1194,GOLD,"There is a castle on a hill,"
1195,GOLD,"So far into the sky,"
1196,GOLD,That birds that from the valley-beds
1197,GOLD,"Up to the turrets fly,"
1198,GOLD,Climbing towards the sun can feel
1199,GOLD,The clouds go tumbling by.
1200,GOLD,
1201,GOLD,But always far above the clouds
1202,GOLD,"The sun is shining there,"
1203,GOLD,It shines for ever on those walls;
1204,GOLD,And the great boughs that bear
1205,GOLD,Harvests of never fading fruit
1206,GOLD,Are golden everywhere.
1207,GOLD,
1208,GOLD,Who journeys to that castled crest
1209,GOLD,"Finds, with his journey done,"
1210,GOLD,All ages and all colours in
1211,GOLD,Cascades of light that run
1212,GOLD,Over the broad weirs of the air
1213,GOLD,For ever from the sun.
1214,GOLD,
1215,GOLD,Two things are silver: flower of plum
1216,GOLD,When April yet is cold;
1217,GOLD,And willowed floods that of the moon
1218,GOLD,Quiet leases hold.
1219,GOLD,That castle in the sky alone
1220,GOLD,Of living things is gold.
1221,GOLD,
1222,GOLD,Between unfathomable blue
1223,GOLD,"And the bright belts of green,"
1224,GOLD,"Midway the plains of heaven and earth,"
1225,GOLD,Rock-borne it stands between
1226,GOLD,"Woods and the sky, a golden world"
1227,GOLD,Where only gold is seen.
1228,GOLD,
1229,GOLD,Old carvers in the stone have cut
1230,GOLD,"Forests and wraths and herds,"
1231,GOLD,And these are gold: the dials tell
1232,GOLD,The sun in golden words;
1233,GOLD,"The very jackdaws, from the towers"
1234,GOLD,"Wheeling, are golden birds."
1235,GOLD,
1236,GOLD,The minting of the sun is on
1237,GOLD,"The gravel everywhere,"
1238,GOLD,The yellow walls are fleeces washed
1239,GOLD,"In pools of sunny air,"
1240,GOLD,That coming to that castle place
1241,GOLD,All men are Jasons there.
1242,GOLD,
1243,GOLD,Trancelike to stand upon that hill
1244,GOLD,"When the deep summer sings,"
1245,GOLD,"Gold-clad, gold-hearted, and gold-voiced,"
1246,GOLD,"And sings and sings and sings,"
1247,GOLD,Is as to wait a rising world
1248,GOLD,In flight of golden wings.
1249,GOLD,
1250,GOLD,"And I have walked with love that way,"
1251,GOLD,And on that golden crest
1252,GOLD,"The sun was happy for my love,"
1253,GOLD,For she is golden-tressed.
1254,GOLD,"Red gold, that of all golden things"
1255,GOLD,The great sun marks for best.
1256,GOLD,
1257,GOLD,O golden castle of the sky
1258,GOLD,Hereafter gold can be
1259,GOLD,Only your image when the sun
1260,GOLD,"Transfigured her for me,"
1261,GOLD,"Till she was golden-clouded Jove,"
1262,GOLD,And I her Danae.
1263,GOLD,
1264,GOLD,Hereafter in the chambered night
1265,GOLD,"When linked love is told,"
1266,GOLD,One thought shall spare to climb that hill
1267,GOLD,"Into the sunbright fold,"
1268,GOLD,For a great summer noon when love
1269,GOLD,"Was gold, and gold, and gold."

1274,BURNING BUSH,
1275,BURNING BUSH,From babyhood I have known the beauty of earth--
1276,BURNING BUSH,"I learnt it, I think, in the strange months before birth,"
1277,BURNING BUSH,I learnt it passing and passing by each moon
1278,BURNING BUSH,From the harvest month into my natal June.
1279,BURNING BUSH,"My mother, the dear, the lovely I hardly knew,"
1280,BURNING BUSH,Bearing me must have walked and wandered through
1281,BURNING BUSH,"Stubble of silver or gold, as moon or sun"
1282,BURNING BUSH,Lit earth in the days when my body was begun.
1283,BURNING BUSH,And then October with leaves splendid and blown
1284,BURNING BUSH,"She watched with my little body a little grown,"
1285,BURNING BUSH,"And winter fell, and into our being passed"
1286,BURNING BUSH,Firm frost and icy rivers and the blast
1287,BURNING BUSH,Of winds that on the iron clods of plough
1288,BURNING BUSH,Beat with an unseen charging. Then the bough
1289,BURNING BUSH,"Of spring came green, and her glad body stirred"
1290,BURNING BUSH,"With a son's wombed leaping, and she heard"
1291,BURNING BUSH,"Songs of the air and woods and waterways,"
1292,BURNING BUSH,And with them singing the coming of my days.
1293,BURNING BUSH,"And nesting time drew on to summer flowers,"
1294,BURNING BUSH,And me unborn she taught through patient hours.
1295,BURNING BUSH,"Then on that first June day, with spices blown"
1296,BURNING BUSH,"Of roses over clover crops unmown,"
1297,BURNING BUSH,"And grey wind-lifted leaves and blossom of bean,"
1298,BURNING BUSH,She gave her dear white beauty to the keen
1299,BURNING BUSH,"Anguish of women, and brought my body to birth"
1300,BURNING BUSH,Already skilled in the sculptures of the earth.
1301,BURNING BUSH,
1302,BURNING BUSH,"Then in the days when her breasts nourished me,"
1303,BURNING BUSH,"Daily she walked, that happy girl, to see"
1304,BURNING BUSH,"How summer prospered to bring the harvest on,"
1305,BURNING BUSH,And how the gardens and how the orchards shone
1306,BURNING BUSH,"With scarlet and blue and yellow flowers and fruit,"
1307,BURNING BUSH,And hear with equal love the lonely flute
1308,BURNING BUSH,"Of legendary satyrs in the wood,"
1309,BURNING BUSH,Or the still voice of Christ in bachelorhood.
1310,BURNING BUSH,And she would come I know to me her son
1311,BURNING BUSH,With lovely secret gossip of journeys done
1312,BURNING BUSH,In fields where some day my own feet should go.
1313,BURNING BUSH,"It was not gossip in words that I could not know,"
1314,BURNING BUSH,"Mere ease and pleasure for her mother wit,"
1315,BURNING BUSH,But such as I could feel the joy of it
1316,BURNING BUSH,"Beating about my baby blood and sense,"
1317,BURNING BUSH,Maternal tending of intelligence
1318,BURNING BUSH,"In the unwhispered rites of bosom and lip,"
1319,BURNING BUSH,Divinings worded in bodily fellowship.
1320,BURNING BUSH,"And every shape and colour and scent she knew,"
1321,BURNING BUSH,"Were intimations winding, folding, through"
1322,BURNING BUSH,"My infancies of flesh and thought, each one"
1323,BURNING BUSH,To find its unblemished record and copy done
1324,BURNING BUSH,In little moods drawn from the suckling-breast...
1325,BURNING BUSH,"That now, in manhood, when I find the nest"
1326,BURNING BUSH,"Of the chaffinch moulded in the elder tree,"
1327,BURNING BUSH,And looking on that lichen cup can see
1328,BURNING BUSH,The images of eternity and space
1329,BURNING BUSH,Lavished upon a small bird's dwelling-place:
1330,BURNING BUSH,Or when from some blue passage of the sky
1331,BURNING BUSH,I know that also colour can prophesy:
1332,BURNING BUSH,"Or, ghosted on the brushing tides of wheat,"
1333,BURNING BUSH,"The gossip of a Galilean street,"
1334,BURNING BUSH,"So many Sabbaths gone, I hear again,"
1335,BURNING BUSH,And his hands plucking that immortal grain:
1336,BURNING BUSH,Or when by spectral ancestries I pass
1337,BURNING BUSH,"Again to Eden, as the orchard grass"
1338,BURNING BUSH,Gives out the scent of mellow apples blown
1339,BURNING BUSH,"From windy boughs--all these, I know, were known"
1340,BURNING BUSH,By that dear mother when the boy to come
1341,BURNING BUSH,Was the zeal and gospel of her martyrdom.
1342,BURNING BUSH,
1343,BURNING BUSH,"Then came the time when I could walk with her,"
1344,BURNING BUSH,"We pilgrims of the fields, with everywhere"
1345,BURNING BUSH,"Strange leaves, and spreading of earth, and hedgerow themes,"
1346,BURNING BUSH,"And mossy walls, and bubbling of the streams,"
1347,BURNING BUSH,"And the way of clouds, and the full moon to wane,"
1348,BURNING BUSH,"The bird-song in the lilacs after rain,"
1349,BURNING BUSH,"And month by month the coming of the flowers,"
1350,BURNING BUSH,"for me to learn in speech, as had been ours"
1351,BURNING BUSH,Knowledge unspoken while she fashioned me...
1352,BURNING BUSH,And then she died; and I went on to be
1353,BURNING BUSH,"Through lonely boyhood her disciple still,"
1354,BURNING BUSH,"A wanderer by many a Berkshire hill,"
1355,BURNING BUSH,"By water-meadows of the Oxford plain,"
1356,BURNING BUSH,"By the thick oaks of Avon, with the strain"
1357,BURNING BUSH,Of an old yeoman wisdom dreaming on
1358,BURNING BUSH,"New beauty ever following beauty gone,"
1359,BURNING BUSH,Until I knew my earth and her raiment fair
1360,BURNING BUSH,"In every difference of the seasons' wear,"
1361,BURNING BUSH,"Long years her scholar, with learning of her ways"
1362,BURNING BUSH,To slip unleasht all singing into praise
1363,BURNING BUSH,Should learning yet by some enchantment be
1364,BURNING BUSH,Bidden to passion's better husbandry.
1365,BURNING BUSH,
1366,BURNING BUSH,"And the enchanted bidding fell. And you,"
1367,BURNING BUSH,"O Love, it was that spelt the earth anew."
1368,BURNING BUSH,
1369,BURNING BUSH,"O Love, you silent wayfarer,"
1370,BURNING BUSH,How many years all unaware
1371,BURNING BUSH,"By blackthorn hedge, and spinney green"
1372,BURNING BUSH,"With larch, I wandered, while unseen"
1373,BURNING BUSH,"You in my shadow walked, nor made"
1374,BURNING BUSH,Even a whisper in the shade.
1375,BURNING BUSH,
1376,BURNING BUSH,"O Love, on many an evening hill"
1377,BURNING BUSH,"I watched the day go down, the still"
1378,BURNING BUSH,"Dark woods, the far great rivers wind,"
1379,BURNING BUSH,"Thin threads of light. And I was blind,"
1380,BURNING BUSH,"Or seeing knew not, for you were"
1381,BURNING BUSH,"Beside me still, yet hidden there."
1382,BURNING BUSH,
1383,BURNING BUSH,"O Love, as year by year went on,"
1384,BURNING BUSH,"And budding primroses were gone,"
1385,BURNING BUSH,"And berries fell, and still the bright"
1386,BURNING BUSH,"Crocuses came in the night,"
1387,BURNING BUSH,"You left me to my task alone,"
1388,BURNING BUSH,"O Love, so near me and unknown."
1389,BURNING BUSH,
1390,BURNING BUSH,"O Love, though she who bore me set"
1391,BURNING BUSH,"Earth's love for ever on me, yet"
1392,BURNING BUSH,"Some word withheld still troubled me,"
1393,BURNING BUSH,"Some presence that I could not see,"
1394,BURNING BUSH,"Till you, dear alien, should come,"
1395,BURNING BUSH,And doctrine be no longer dumb.
1396,BURNING BUSH,
1397,BURNING BUSH,"O Love, one April night I heard"
1398,BURNING BUSH,"The doctrine's everlasting word,"
1399,BURNING BUSH,"And you beneath that starry sky,"
1400,BURNING BUSH,"Unknown, were with me suddenly,"
1401,BURNING BUSH,"Yet there was no new meeting then,"
1402,BURNING BUSH,But some old marriage come again.
1403,BURNING BUSH,
1404,BURNING BUSH,"O Love, and now is earth my friend,"
1405,BURNING BUSH,"Telling me all, until the end"
1406,BURNING BUSH,When I shall in the earth be laid
1407,BURNING BUSH,"With all my maps and fancies made,"
1408,BURNING BUSH,"And you, Love, were the secret earth"
1409,BURNING BUSH,Of my blind following from birth.
1410,BURNING BUSH,
1411,BURNING BUSH,"O Love, you happy wayfarer,"
1412,BURNING BUSH,"Be still my fond interpreter,"
1413,BURNING BUSH,Of all the glory that can be
1414,BURNING BUSH,"As once on starlit Winchelsea,"
1415,BURNING BUSH,Finding upon my pilgrim way
1416,BURNING BUSH,A burning bush for every day.

1429,(AGED SIXTEEN),
1430,(AGED SIXTEEN),"As some year yet, when you, my son to be,"

1433,(AGED SIXTEEN),Myself imprinted as but she could know
1434,(AGED SIXTEEN),To make amendment so.
1435,(AGED SIXTEEN),
1436,(AGED SIXTEEN),"I see you then, your sixteen years alight"
1437,(AGED SIXTEEN),"With limbs all true and golden hair,"
1438,(AGED SIXTEEN),"And you, unborn, I will, this April night,"
1439,(AGED SIXTEEN),Tell of the faith and honour you must wear
1440,(AGED SIXTEEN),"For love, whose light you bear."
1441,(AGED SIXTEEN),
1442,(AGED SIXTEEN),"Beauty you have; as, mothered so, could face"
1443,(AGED SIXTEEN),Or limbs or hair be otherwise?
1444,(AGED SIXTEEN),"Years gone, dear boy, there was a virgin grace"
1445,(AGED SIXTEEN),Worth Homer's laurel under western skies
1446,(AGED SIXTEEN),To wander and devise.
1447,(AGED SIXTEEN),
1448,(AGED SIXTEEN),"Beauty you have. Cherish it as divine,"
1449,(AGED SIXTEEN),"Wash it with dews of diligence,"

1451,(AGED SIXTEEN),"Of inward light, the spirit's excellence"
1452,(AGED SIXTEEN),Made visible to sense.
1453,(AGED SIXTEEN),
1454,(AGED SIXTEEN),"Athlete be you; strong runner to the goal,"
1455,(AGED SIXTEEN),Glad though the game be lost or won:
1456,(AGED SIXTEEN),"Fleet limbs that chronicle a fleeter soul,"
1457,(AGED SIXTEEN),"In every winter valiantly to run,"
1458,(AGED SIXTEEN),Till the last race be done.
1459,(AGED SIXTEEN),
1460,(AGED SIXTEEN),"Love wisdom that is suited in a rhyme,"
1461,(AGED SIXTEEN),And be in all your learning known
1462,(AGED SIXTEEN),"Old minstrels chanting out of faded time,"
1463,(AGED SIXTEEN),Since he who counts all years gone by alone
1464,(AGED SIXTEEN),Makes any year his own.
1465,(AGED SIXTEEN),
1466,(AGED SIXTEEN),"And when one day you are a lover too,"
1467,(AGED SIXTEEN),"Come back to her who bore you, dear,"
1468,(AGED SIXTEEN),Tell out your tale; you shall the better woo
1469,(AGED SIXTEEN),"For every word that from her lips you hear,"
1470,(AGED SIXTEEN),For she made love most clear.
1471,(AGED SIXTEEN),
1472,(AGED SIXTEEN),Most clear for him who sits beside you now;
1473,(AGED SIXTEEN),There was a certain frost that fell
1474,(AGED SIXTEEN),"Before its time upon a summer bough,--"
1475,(AGED SIXTEEN),"And how at last that reckoning was well,"
1476,(AGED SIXTEEN),She for your love shall tell.
1477,(AGED SIXTEEN),
1478,(AGED SIXTEEN),"Labour to build your house, but ever keep"
1479,(AGED SIXTEEN),"That greater garden fresh in mind,"
1480,(AGED SIXTEEN),That England with its bird-song buried deep
1481,(AGED SIXTEEN),In cool great woods where chivalry can find
1482,(AGED SIXTEEN),The province of its kind.
1483,(AGED SIXTEEN),
1484,(AGED SIXTEEN),"Be great or little your inheritance,"
1485,(AGED SIXTEEN),Know there shall number in that dower
1486,(AGED SIXTEEN),No treasure from the treasuries of chance
1487,(AGED SIXTEEN),So rare as that you came the perfect flower
1488,(AGED SIXTEEN),Of love's most perfect hour.
1489,(AGED SIXTEEN),
1490,(AGED SIXTEEN),"Go now, my son. Be all I might have been."
1491,(AGED SIXTEEN),"(Ask her. She knows, and none but she.)"
1492,(AGED SIXTEEN),Her beauty and her wisdom weathered clean
