154,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"Daughter of tarn and tor, the moors that were once her home"
155,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,No longer know her step on the upland tracks forlorn
156,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,Where she was wont to roam.
157,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,
158,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"All her hounds are dead, her beautiful hounds are dead,"
159,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"That paced beside the hoofs of her high and nimble horse,"
160,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,Or streaked in lean pursuit of the tawny hare that fled
161,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,Out of the yellow gorse.
162,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,
163,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"All her lovers have passed, her beautiful lovers have passed,"
164,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"The young and eager men that fought for her arrogant hand,"
165,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,And the only voice which endures to mourn for her at the last
166,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,Is the voice of the lonely land.
167,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,
168,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,
169,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,SORROW OF DEPARTURE. _For D._
170,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,
171,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"HE sat among the shadows lost,"
172,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,And heard the careless voice speak on
173,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"Of life when he was gone from home,"
174,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"Of days that he had made his own,"
175,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"Familiar schemes that he had known,"
176,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,And dates that he had cherished most
177,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"As star-points in the year to come,"
178,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"And he was suddenly alone,"
179,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"Thinking (not bitterly,"
180,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,But with a grave regret) that he
181,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,Was in that room a ghost.
182,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,
183,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"He sat among the shades apart,"
184,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,The careless voice he scarcely heard.
185,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,In that arrested hour there stirred
186,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,Shy birds of beauty in his heart.
187,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,
188,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,The clouds of March he would not see
189,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"Across the sky race royally,"
190,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,Nor yet the drift of daffodil
191,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"He planted with so glad a hand,"
192,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,Nor yet the loveliness he planned
193,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"For summer’s sequence to fulfil,"
194,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,Nor trace upon the hill
195,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"The annual waking of the land,"
196,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,Nor meditative stand
197,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,To watch the turning of the mill.
198,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,
199,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,He would not pause above the Weald
200,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"With twilight falling dim,"
201,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"And mark the chequer-board of field,"
202,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"The water gleaming like a shield,"
203,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"The oast-house in the elms concealed,"
204,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"Nor see, from heaven’s chalice-rim,"
205,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"The vintaged sunset brim,"
206,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"Nor yet the high, suspended star"
207,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,Hanging eternally afar.
208,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,
209,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"These things would be, but not for him."
210,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,
211,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,At summer noon he would not lie
212,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"One with his cutter’s rise and dip,"
213,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"Free with the wind and sea and sky,"
214,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"And watch the dappled waves go by,"
215,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,The sea-gulls scream and slip;
216,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"White sails, white birds, white clouds, white foam,"
217,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,White cliffs that curled the love of home
218,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,Around him like a whip....
219,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,He would not see that summer noon
220,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"Fade into dusk from light,"
221,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,While he on shifting waters bright
222,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"Sailed idly on, beneath the moon"
223,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,Climbing the dome of night.
224,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,
225,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,This was his dream of happy things
226,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"That he had loved through many springs,"
227,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,And never more might know.
228,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,But man must pass the shrouded gate
229,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"Companioned by his secret fate,"
230,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"And he must lonely go,"
231,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"And none can help or understand,"
232,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,"For other men may touch his hand,"
233,MARIANA IN THE NORTH,But none the soul below.

1627,MIRAGE,THERE travelled north from Kurdistan along the lone Siberian trails
1628,MIRAGE,A merchant with his caravan and Eastern barter in his bales.
1629,MIRAGE,"He rode ahead, he rode apart, the city of Irkutsk his goal,"
1630,MIRAGE,"Upon his lean Circassian foal, and after came the lumbering cart"
1631,MIRAGE,"With creaking wheel, deliberate spoke, and water-bullocks in the yoke;"
1632,MIRAGE,"And after these in single string the boorish camels following,"
1633,MIRAGE,Slouching with high unwieldy packs like howdahs piled upon their backs;
1634,MIRAGE,With slaver hanging from their lips and hatred worming in their brain
1635,MIRAGE,They slouched beneath their drivers’ whips across the white and
1636,MIRAGE,mournful plain.
1637,MIRAGE,
1638,MIRAGE,"The merchant riding on alone saw not the white incessant snow,"
1639,MIRAGE,"He only saw the metal’s glow, the colour of the precious stone;"
1640,MIRAGE,"He lingered on the merchandise that he had brought from Kurdistan,"
1641,MIRAGE,"And turned, and swept his caravan with doting and voluptuous eyes,"
1642,MIRAGE,"For there were choice Bokhara rugs, and daggers with Damascus blade"
1643,MIRAGE,"And hafts of turquoise-studded jade, and phials rich with scented drugs,"
1644,MIRAGE,"Koràns inscribed on ass’s skin, and bales of silk from Temesvàr,"
1645,MIRAGE,"And silver ear-rings beaten thin, and bargains from the cool bazaar."
1646,MIRAGE,
1647,MIRAGE,"He felt the gold already pouched, he crooned to it with horrid love,"
1648,MIRAGE,As still the camels onward slouched with hatred of the men that drove.
1649,MIRAGE,
1650,MIRAGE,"For thirty days the caravan trailed on behind the merchant’s foal,"
1651,MIRAGE,"Through Persia and through Turkestan, the city of Irkutsk their goal;"
1652,MIRAGE,They passed the fruitful hill-girt lands where dwelt the fair-skinned
1653,MIRAGE,"Grecian race,"
1654,MIRAGE,"And came into the wilder place, and sighted vagrant Cossack bands"
1655,MIRAGE,"That wandered with their flocks and herds, and trafficked with the"
1656,MIRAGE,train of Kurds;
1657,MIRAGE,"They stirred the ghost of Tamerlane, who swept that way with Tartar"
1658,MIRAGE,"hordes,"
1659,MIRAGE,"The ghosts of dead barbarian lords, the Asiatic hurricane;"
1660,MIRAGE,They crossed the mighty road that runs from Moscow through to
1661,MIRAGE,"China’s wall,"
1662,MIRAGE,And trod the path of nomad Huns and knew Siberia’s white pall
1663,MIRAGE,When fields of Persian asphodel were visions of a distant day
1664,MIRAGE,"And boundless snow around them lay, and noiseless snow for ever fell,"
1665,MIRAGE,"Where soon the fleeting day was done, and on the hard horizon low"
1666,MIRAGE,They saw the scarlet ball of sun divided by the ridge of snow
1667,MIRAGE,Sink down in skies incarnadine; and still with their disjointed gait
1668,MIRAGE,"And nursing their malignant hate, the camels kept unbroken line."
1669,MIRAGE,
1670,MIRAGE,When yet a hundred miles or more stretched out between them and their goal
1671,MIRAGE,The merchant riding on before drew rein on his Circassian foal
1672,MIRAGE,And called a halt with lifted hand as he had done unfailingly
1673,MIRAGE,Each night since the monotony began with that unvaried land.
1674,MIRAGE,"The dusk was suddenly alive as shouting voices passed the word,"
1675,MIRAGE,And all the drowsy train was stirred with movement like a shaken hive.
1676,MIRAGE,"The master merchant stiff from cramp was calling for his saddle flask,"
1677,MIRAGE,As each to his accustomed task ran swiftly in the growing camp.
1678,MIRAGE,"A tent like an inverted bell, all scarlet with the dyes of Tyre,"
1679,MIRAGE,"Was lifted rapidly and well, and like a torch the kindled fire"
1680,MIRAGE,"Destroyed the night with leaping tongue, and in a circle round the glow"
1681,MIRAGE,"Men shovelled back the melting snow, and skins and Khelim rugs"
1682,MIRAGE,were flung--
1683,MIRAGE,And unforgotten were the needs of water-bullocks standing by
1684,MIRAGE,"Whose brows are stained with orange dye, whose horns are looped"
1685,MIRAGE,with turquoise beads.
1686,MIRAGE,The pariah dogs that slink and prowl secured their meat with
1687,MIRAGE,"furtive growl,"
1688,MIRAGE,And one by one the camels bent complaining to their warty knees
1689,MIRAGE,And grumbled at the men that went to loose their girths and give
1690,MIRAGE,them ease.
1691,MIRAGE,
1692,MIRAGE,The merchant brooded silently on avaricious visions bright
1693,MIRAGE,And listened to the revelry his men were making in the night.
1694,MIRAGE,"For one, a young and favourite Kurd, a mongrel child of the bazaar,"
1695,MIRAGE,"Whose voice was like a singing bird, was striking on a harsh guitar--"
1696,MIRAGE,
1697,MIRAGE,I know a Room where tulips tall
1698,MIRAGE,And almond-blossom pale
1699,MIRAGE,Are coloured on the frescoed wall.
1700,MIRAGE,
1701,MIRAGE,I know a River where the ships
1702,MIRAGE,Drift by with ghostly sail
1703,MIRAGE,And dead men chant with merry lips.
1704,MIRAGE,
1705,MIRAGE,I know the Garden by the sea
1706,MIRAGE,Where birds with painted wings
1707,MIRAGE,Mottle the dark magnolia Tree.
1708,MIRAGE,
1709,MIRAGE,"I know the never-failing Source,"
1710,MIRAGE,"I know the Bush that sings,"
1711,MIRAGE,"The Vale of Gems, the flying Horse."
1712,MIRAGE,
1713,MIRAGE,"I know the Dog that was a Prince,"
1714,MIRAGE,"The talking Nightingale,"
1715,MIRAGE,"The Hill of glass, the magic Quince."
1716,MIRAGE,
1717,MIRAGE,I know the lovely Lake of Van;
1718,MIRAGE,"Yet, knowing all these things,"
1719,MIRAGE,"I wander with a Caravan,"
1720,MIRAGE,I wander with a Caravan!
1721,MIRAGE,
1722,MIRAGE,"The cold moon rose remotely higher, insensibly the voices hushed,"
1723,MIRAGE,"And men with wine and laughter flushed were sleeping all around the fire,"
1724,MIRAGE,"Till one alone sat on erect, his ready gun across his knees,"
1725,MIRAGE,"The sentry of the night elect, guardian of sleeping destinies."
1726,MIRAGE,"The water-bullocks lay as dead; the dogs drew near with noiseless tread,"
1727,MIRAGE,"And huddled in a loose-limbed heap beside the fire, and through"
1728,MIRAGE,their sleep
1729,MIRAGE,They twitched at some remembered hunt; the merchant in his sheepskin
1730,MIRAGE,rolled
1731,MIRAGE,Within the tent saw dreams of gold; the camels with uneasy grunt
1732,MIRAGE,And quake of their distorted backs slept on with loathing by their packs.
1733,MIRAGE,
1734,MIRAGE,"At dawn the weary sentry rose to throw some brushwood on the flames,"
1735,MIRAGE,"Called on his comrades by their names, and turned to greet the"
1736,MIRAGE,"endless snows,"
1737,MIRAGE,But then from his astonished lips a cry of unbelieving rang
1738,MIRAGE,"And all the men towards him sprang, the camel drivers with their whips,"
1739,MIRAGE,"The bullock driver with his yoke, and gazed in loud bewilderment"
1740,MIRAGE,Till slowly in his fur-lined cloak the merchant issued from his tent.
1741,MIRAGE,"Then he too started at the sight and clamoured with his clamorous men,"
1742,MIRAGE,"And swore he could not see aright, and rubbed his eyes and stared again;"
1743,MIRAGE,The camels came with lurching tread and stood in loose fantastic ring
1744,MIRAGE,With necks outstretched and swaying head and mouths all slackly
1745,MIRAGE,"slobbering,"
1746,MIRAGE,And drew from some unclean recess within their body’s secret lair
1747,MIRAGE,A bladder smeared with filthiness that bubbled on the morning air.
1748,MIRAGE,
1749,MIRAGE,"For there upon the shining plain a city radiantly lay,"
1750,MIRAGE,"All coloured in the rising day, amid the snow a jewelled stain,"
1751,MIRAGE,And in her walls a spacious gate gave entrance to a varied stream
1752,MIRAGE,"Of folk that went incorporate like figures in a silent dream,"
1753,MIRAGE,"And high above the roofs arose, more coloured for the hueless snows,"
1754,MIRAGE,"The domes of churches, bronze and green, like peacocks in their"
1755,MIRAGE,painted sheen.
1756,MIRAGE,
1757,MIRAGE,"The merchant, with a trembling hand extended far, extended wide"
1758,MIRAGE,"Against illusion’s fairyland, at length articulately cried:"
1759,MIRAGE,“Irkutsk! but twice a hundred miles remained of weary pilgrimage
1760,MIRAGE,Before we hoped with happy smiles to reach our final anchorage.
1761,MIRAGE,
1762,MIRAGE,But look again. That rosy tower that rises like a tulip straight
1763,MIRAGE,"Within the walls beside the gate, a balanced plume, a springing flower,"
1764,MIRAGE,"And pointed with a lance-like spire of bronze, was fifty years ago"
1765,MIRAGE,"--A boy, I saw it standing so,--demolished and destroyed by fire.”"
1766,MIRAGE,
1767,MIRAGE,"And one, a venerable Kurd, took up again the fallen word:"
1768,MIRAGE,"“I travelled both as boy and man between Irkutsk and Kurdistan,"
1769,MIRAGE,But never since my beard was grown saw I that inn beside the way
1770,MIRAGE,"Wherewith the Council made away, full fifty counted years aflown.”"
1771,MIRAGE,
1772,MIRAGE,"They gazed upon the marvel long, the spectre city wonderful,"
1773,MIRAGE,"Until the youth who made the song cried out, “We grow too fanciful."
1774,MIRAGE,"Irkutsk with roofs of coloured tiles lies distant twice a hundred miles,"
1775,MIRAGE,"And this, a city of the shades, a rainbow of the echoing air,"
1776,MIRAGE,"As fair as false, and false as fair, already into nothing fades.”"
1777,MIRAGE,
1778,MIRAGE,"And like a bubble, like the mist that in the valley faintly swirls,"
1779,MIRAGE,"Like orient sheen on sulky pearls, like hills remotely amethyst,"
1780,MIRAGE,"Like colours on Phœnician glass, like plumage on the ‘fisher’s wing,"
1781,MIRAGE,"Like music on the breath of spring, they saw the vision lift and pass,"
1782,MIRAGE,"Till only white unbroken snow stretched out before the caravan,"
1783,MIRAGE,And the bewildered heart of man truth from delusion could not know.
1784,MIRAGE,But all the long laborious train moved slowly on its course again
1785,MIRAGE,"Across the snow unbroken, white, and nursing each his private creed,"
1786,MIRAGE,"The merchant his illusive greed, the camels their illusive spite."
