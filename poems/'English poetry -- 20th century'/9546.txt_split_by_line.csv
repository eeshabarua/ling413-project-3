47,PREFATORY NOTE,This third book of 'Georgian Poetry' carries to the end of a seventh
48,PREFATORY NOTE,year the presentation of chosen examples from the work of contemporary
49,PREFATORY NOTE,poets belonging to the younger generation. Of the eighteen writers
50,PREFATORY NOTE,"included, nine appear in the series for the first time. The"
51,PREFATORY NOTE,representation of the older inhabitants has in most cases been
52,PREFATORY NOTE,restricted in order to allow full space for the new-comers; and the
53,PREFATORY NOTE,"alphabetical order of the names has been reversed, so as to bring more"
54,PREFATORY NOTE,of these into prominence than would otherwise have been done.
55,PREFATORY NOTE,
56,PREFATORY NOTE,My thanks for permission to print the poems are due to Messrs. Chatto &
57,PREFATORY NOTE,"Windus, Constable, Fifield, Heinemann, Macmillan, Elkin Mathews, Martin"
58,PREFATORY NOTE,"Secker, and Sidgwick & Jackson, and to the Editors of the 'Nation', the"
59,PREFATORY NOTE,"'New Statesman', and 'To-Day'."

245,ROMANCE,When I was but thirteen or so
246,ROMANCE,"I went into a golden land,"
247,ROMANCE,"Chimborazo, Cotopaxi"
248,ROMANCE,Took me by the hand.
249,ROMANCE,
250,ROMANCE,"My father died, my brother too,"
251,ROMANCE,"They passed like fleeting dreams,"
252,ROMANCE,I stood where Popocatapetl
253,ROMANCE,In the sunlight gleams.
254,ROMANCE,
255,ROMANCE,I dimly heard the master's voice
256,ROMANCE,"And boys far-off at play,"
257,ROMANCE,"Chimborazo, Cotopaxi"
258,ROMANCE,Had stolen me away.
259,ROMANCE,
260,ROMANCE,I walked in a great golden dream
261,ROMANCE,To and fro from school--
262,ROMANCE,Shining Popocatapetl
263,ROMANCE,The dusty streets did rule.
264,ROMANCE,
265,ROMANCE,I walked home with a gold dark boy
266,ROMANCE,"And never a word I'd say,"
267,ROMANCE,"Chimborazo, Cotopaxi"
268,ROMANCE,Had taken my speech away:
269,ROMANCE,
270,ROMANCE,I gazed entranced upon his face
271,ROMANCE,Fairer than any flower--
272,ROMANCE,O shining Popocatapetl
273,ROMANCE,It was thy magic hour:
274,ROMANCE,
275,ROMANCE,"The houses, people, traffic seemed"
276,ROMANCE,"Thin fading dreams by day,"
277,ROMANCE,"Chimborazo, Cotopaxi"
278,ROMANCE,They had stolen my soul away!

282,ECSTASY,ECSTASY
283,ECSTASY,
284,ECSTASY,
285,ECSTASY,I saw a frieze on whitest marble drawn
286,ECSTASY,"Of boys who sought for shells along the shore,"
287,ECSTASY,"Their white feet shedding pallor in the sea,"
288,ECSTASY,"The shallow sea, the spring-time sea of green"
289,ECSTASY,"That faintly creamed against the cold, smooth pebbles."
290,ECSTASY,
291,ECSTASY,"The air was thin, their limbs were delicate,"
292,ECSTASY,The wind had graven their small eager hands
293,ECSTASY,To feel the forests and the dark nights of Asia
294,ECSTASY,"Behind the purple bloom of the horizon,"
295,ECSTASY,Where sails would float and slowly melt away.
296,ECSTASY,
297,ECSTASY,"Their naked, pure, and grave, unbroken silence"
298,ECSTASY,"Filled the soft air as gleaming, limpid water"
299,ECSTASY,Fills a spring sky those days when rain is lying
300,ECSTASY,"In shattered bright pools on the wind-dried roads,"
301,ECSTASY,And their sweet bodies were wind-purified.
302,ECSTASY,
303,ECSTASY,One held a shell unto his shell-like ear
304,ECSTASY,"And there was music carven in his face,"
305,ECSTASY,"His eyes half-closed, his lips just breaking open"
306,ECSTASY,"To catch the lulling, mazy, coralline roar"
307,ECSTASY,Of numberless caverns filled with singing seas.
308,ECSTASY,
309,ECSTASY,And all of them were hearkening as to singing
310,ECSTASY,"Of far-off voices thin and delicate,"
311,ECSTASY,Voices too fine for any mortal wind
312,ECSTASY,To blow into the whorls of mortal ears--
313,ECSTASY,"And yet those sounds flowed from their grave, sweet faces."
314,ECSTASY,
315,ECSTASY,"And as I looked I heard that delicate music,"
316,ECSTASY,"And I became as grave, as calm, as still"
317,ECSTASY,"As those carved boys. I stood upon that shore,"
318,ECSTASY,"I felt the cool sea dream around my feet,"
319,ECSTASY,My eyes were staring at the far horizon:
320,ECSTASY,
321,ECSTASY,"And the wind came and purified my limbs,"
322,ECSTASY,"And the stars came and set within my eyes,"
323,ECSTASY,"And snowy clouds rested upon my shoulders,"
324,ECSTASY,"And the blue sky shimmered deep within me,"
325,ECSTASY,And I sang like a carven pipe of music.

331,MAGIC,I love a still conservatory
332,MAGIC,"That's full of giant, breathless palms,"
333,MAGIC,"Azaleas, clematis and vines,"
334,MAGIC,Whose quietness great Trees becalms
335,MAGIC,"Filling the air with foliage,"
336,MAGIC,A curved and dreamy statuary.
337,MAGIC,
338,MAGIC,"I like to hear a cold, pure rill"
339,MAGIC,"Of water trickling low, afar"
340,MAGIC,With sudden little jerks and purls
341,MAGIC,"Into a tank or stoneware jar,"
342,MAGIC,The song of a tiny sleeping bird
343,MAGIC,Held like a shadow in its trill.
344,MAGIC,
345,MAGIC,I love the mossy quietness
346,MAGIC,"That grows upon the great stone flags,"
347,MAGIC,"The dark tree-ferns, the staghorn ferns,"
348,MAGIC,"The prehistoric, antlered stags"
349,MAGIC,That carven stand and stare among
350,MAGIC,"The silent, ferny wilderness."
351,MAGIC,
352,MAGIC,And are they birds or souls that flit
353,MAGIC,"Among the trees so silently,"
354,MAGIC,And are they fish or ghosts that haunt
355,MAGIC,The still pools of the rockery!--
356,MAGIC,For I am but a sculptured rock
357,MAGIC,As in that magic place I sit.
358,MAGIC,
359,MAGIC,Still as a great jewel is the air
360,MAGIC,"With boughs and leaves smooth-carved in it,"
361,MAGIC,"And rocks and trees and giant ferns,"
362,MAGIC,"And blooms with inner radiance lit,"
363,MAGIC,And naked water like a nymph
364,MAGIC,That dances tireless slim and bare.
365,MAGIC,
366,MAGIC,I watch a white Nyanza float

822,TO A BULL-DOG,
823,TO A BULL-DOG,
824,TO A BULL-DOG,"(W. H. S., Capt. [Acting Major] R. F. A.; killed, April 12, 1917)"
825,TO A BULL-DOG,
826,TO A BULL-DOG,
827,TO A BULL-DOG,"We shan't see Willy any more, Mamie,"
828,TO A BULL-DOG,He won't be coming any more:
829,TO A BULL-DOG,"He came back once and again and again,"
830,TO A BULL-DOG,But he won't get leave any more.
831,TO A BULL-DOG,
832,TO A BULL-DOG,"We looked from the window and there was his cab,"
833,TO A BULL-DOG,"And we ran downstairs like a streak,"
834,TO A BULL-DOG,"And he said, 'Hullo, you bad dog,' and you crouched to the floor,"
835,TO A BULL-DOG,"Paralysed to hear him speak,"
836,TO A BULL-DOG,
837,TO A BULL-DOG,And then let fly at his face and his chest
838,TO A BULL-DOG,"Till I had to hold you down,"
839,TO A BULL-DOG,"While he took off his cap and his gloves and his coat,"
840,TO A BULL-DOG,And his bag and his thonged Sam Browne.
841,TO A BULL-DOG,
842,TO A BULL-DOG,"We went upstairs to the studio,"
843,TO A BULL-DOG,"The three of us, just as of old,"
844,TO A BULL-DOG,And you lay down and I sat and talked to him
845,TO A BULL-DOG,As round the room he strolled.
846,TO A BULL-DOG,
847,TO A BULL-DOG,"Here in the room where, years ago"
848,TO A BULL-DOG,"Before the old life stopped,"
849,TO A BULL-DOG,"He worked all day with his slippers and his pipe,"
850,TO A BULL-DOG,"He would pick up the threads he'd dropped,"
851,TO A BULL-DOG,
852,TO A BULL-DOG,"Fondling all the drawings he had left behind,"
853,TO A BULL-DOG,"Glad to find them all still the same,"
854,TO A BULL-DOG,And opening the cupboards to look at his belongings
855,TO A BULL-DOG,... Every time he came.
856,TO A BULL-DOG,
857,TO A BULL-DOG,"But now I know what a dog doesn't know,"
858,TO A BULL-DOG,"Though you'll thrust your head on my knee,"
859,TO A BULL-DOG,And try to draw me from the absent-mindedness
860,TO A BULL-DOG,That you find so dull in me.
861,TO A BULL-DOG,
862,TO A BULL-DOG,And all your life you will never know
863,TO A BULL-DOG,"What I wouldn't tell you even if I could,"
864,TO A BULL-DOG,That the last time we waved him away
865,TO A BULL-DOG,Willy went for good.
866,TO A BULL-DOG,
867,TO A BULL-DOG,But sometimes as you lie on the hearthrug
868,TO A BULL-DOG,"Sleeping in the warmth of the stove,"
869,TO A BULL-DOG,Even through your muddled old canine brain
870,TO A BULL-DOG,Shapes from the past may rove.
871,TO A BULL-DOG,
872,TO A BULL-DOG,"You'll scarcely remember, even in a dream,"
873,TO A BULL-DOG,"How we brought home a silly little pup,"
874,TO A BULL-DOG,With a big square head and little crooked legs
875,TO A BULL-DOG,"That could scarcely bear him up,"
876,TO A BULL-DOG,
877,TO A BULL-DOG,But your tail will tap at the memory
878,TO A BULL-DOG,"Of a man whose friend you were,"
879,TO A BULL-DOG,Who was always kind though he called you a naughty dog
880,TO A BULL-DOG,When he found you on his chair;
881,TO A BULL-DOG,
882,TO A BULL-DOG,Who'd make you face a reproving finger
883,TO A BULL-DOG,And solemnly lecture you
884,TO A BULL-DOG,Till your head hung downwards and you looked very sheepish:
885,TO A BULL-DOG,"And you'll dream of your triumphs too,"
886,TO A BULL-DOG,
887,TO A BULL-DOG,Of summer evening chases in the garden
888,TO A BULL-DOG,When you dodged us all about with a bone:
889,TO A BULL-DOG,"We were three boys, and you were the cleverest,"
890,TO A BULL-DOG,But now we're two alone.
891,TO A BULL-DOG,
892,TO A BULL-DOG,"When summer comes again,"
893,TO A BULL-DOG,"And the long sunsets fade,"
894,TO A BULL-DOG,We shall have to go on playing the feeble game for two
895,TO A BULL-DOG,That since the war we've played.
896,TO A BULL-DOG,
897,TO A BULL-DOG,And though you run expectant as you always do
898,TO A BULL-DOG,"To the uniforms we meet,"
899,TO A BULL-DOG,You'll never find Willy among all the soldiers
900,TO A BULL-DOG,"In even the longest street,"
901,TO A BULL-DOG,
902,TO A BULL-DOG,"Nor in any crowd; yet, strange and bitter thought,"
903,TO A BULL-DOG,"Even now were the old words said,"
904,TO A BULL-DOG,If I tried the old trick and said 'Where's Willy?'
905,TO A BULL-DOG,"You would quiver and lift your head,"
906,TO A BULL-DOG,
907,TO A BULL-DOG,"And your brown eyes would look to ask if I was serious,"
908,TO A BULL-DOG,And wait for the word to spring.
909,TO A BULL-DOG,"Sleep undisturbed: I shan't say 'that' again,"
910,TO A BULL-DOG,You innocent old thing.
911,TO A BULL-DOG,
912,TO A BULL-DOG,"I must sit, not speaking, on the sofa,"
913,TO A BULL-DOG,While you lie asleep on the floor;
914,TO A BULL-DOG,"For he's suffered a thing that dogs couldn't dream of,"
915,TO A BULL-DOG,And he won't be coming here any more.

919,THE LILY OF MALUD,THE LILY OF MALUD
920,THE LILY OF MALUD,
921,THE LILY OF MALUD,
922,THE LILY OF MALUD,The lily of Malud is born in secret mud.
923,THE LILY OF MALUD,It is breathed like a word in a little dark ravine
924,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Where no bird was ever heard and no beast was ever seen,"
925,THE LILY OF MALUD,And the leaves are never stirred by the panther's velvet sheen.
926,THE LILY OF MALUD,
927,THE LILY OF MALUD,"It blooms once a year in summer moonlight,"
928,THE LILY OF MALUD,In a valley of dark fear full of pale moonlight:
929,THE LILY OF MALUD,"It blooms once a year, and dies in a night,"
930,THE LILY OF MALUD,And its petals disappear with the dawn's first light;
931,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And when that night has come, black small-breasted maids,"
932,THE LILY OF MALUD,"With ecstatic terror dumb, steal fawn-like through the shades"
933,THE LILY OF MALUD,"To watch, hour by hour, the unfolding of the flower."
934,THE LILY OF MALUD,
935,THE LILY OF MALUD,"When the world is full of night, and the moon reigns alone"
936,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And drowns in silver light the known and the unknown,"
937,THE LILY OF MALUD,"When each hut is a mound, half blue-silver and half black,"
938,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And casts upon the ground the hard shadow of its back,"
939,THE LILY OF MALUD,"When the winds are out of hearing and the tree-tops never shake,"
940,THE LILY OF MALUD,When the grass in the clearing is silent but awake
941,THE LILY OF MALUD,'Neath a moon-paven sky: all the village is asleep
942,THE LILY OF MALUD,And the babes that nightly cry dream deep:
943,THE LILY OF MALUD,
944,THE LILY OF MALUD,"From the doors the maidens creep,"
945,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Tiptoe over dreaming curs, soft, so soft, that not one stirs,"
946,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And stand curved and a-quiver, like bathers by a river,"
947,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Looking at the forest wall, groups of slender naked girls,"
948,THE LILY OF MALUD,Whose black bodies shine like pearls where the moonbeams fall.
949,THE LILY OF MALUD,
950,THE LILY OF MALUD,"They have waked, they knew not why, at a summons from the night,"
951,THE LILY OF MALUD,"They have stolen fearfully from the dark to the light,"
952,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Stepping over sleeping men, who have moved and slept again:"
953,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And they know not why they go to the forest, but they know,"
954,THE LILY OF MALUD,As their moth-feet pass to the shore of the grass
955,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And the forest's dreadful brink, that their tender spirits shrink:"
956,THE LILY OF MALUD,"They would flee, but cannot turn, for their eyelids burn"
957,THE LILY OF MALUD,"With still frenzy, and each maid, ere she leaves the moonlit space,"
958,THE LILY OF MALUD,If she sees another's face is thrilled and afraid.
959,THE LILY OF MALUD,
960,THE LILY OF MALUD,Now like little phantom fawns they thread the outer lawns
961,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Where the boles of giant trees stand about in twos and threes,"
962,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Till the forest grows more dense and the darkness more intense,"
963,THE LILY OF MALUD,And they only sometimes see in a lone moon-ray
964,THE LILY OF MALUD,"A dead and spongy trunk in the earth half-sunk,"
965,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Or the roots of a tree with fungus grey,"
966,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Or a drift of muddy leaves, or a banded snake that heaves."
967,THE LILY OF MALUD,
968,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And the towering unseen roof grows more intricate, and soon"
969,THE LILY OF MALUD,It is featureless and proof to the lost forgotten moon.
970,THE LILY OF MALUD,But they could not look above as with blind-drawn feet they move
971,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Onwards on the scarce-felt path, with quick and desperate breath,"
972,THE LILY OF MALUD,"For their circling fingers dread to caress some slimy head,"
973,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Or to touch the icy shape of a hunched and hairy ape,"
974,THE LILY OF MALUD,And at every step they fear in their very midst to hear
975,THE LILY OF MALUD,A lion's rending roar or a tiger's snore....
976,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And when things swish or fall, they shiver but dare not call."
977,THE LILY OF MALUD,
978,THE LILY OF MALUD,O what is it leads the way that they do not stray?
979,THE LILY OF MALUD,What unimagined arm keeps their bodies from harm?
980,THE LILY OF MALUD,What presence concealed lifts their little feet that yield
981,THE LILY OF MALUD,Over dry ground and wet till their straining eyes are met
982,THE LILY OF MALUD,With a thinning of the darkness?
983,THE LILY OF MALUD,
984,THE LILY OF MALUD,And the foremost faintly cries in awed surprise:
985,THE LILY OF MALUD,And they one by one emerge from the gloom to the verge
986,THE LILY OF MALUD,Of a small sunken vale full of moonlight pale.
987,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And they hang along the bank, clinging to the branches dank,"
988,THE LILY OF MALUD,A shadowy festoon out of sight of the moon;
989,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And they see in front of them, rising from the mud,"
990,THE LILY OF MALUD,A single straight stem and a single pallid bud
991,THE LILY OF MALUD,In that little lake of light from the moon's calm height.
992,THE LILY OF MALUD,
993,THE LILY OF MALUD,"A stem, a ghostly bud, on the moon-swept mud"
994,THE LILY OF MALUD,That shimmers like a pond; and over there beyond
995,THE LILY OF MALUD,"The guardian forest high, menacing and strange,"
996,THE LILY OF MALUD,Invades the empty sky with its wild black range.
997,THE LILY OF MALUD,
998,THE LILY OF MALUD,And they watch hour by hour that small lonely flower
999,THE LILY OF MALUD,In that deep forest place that hunter never found.
1000,THE LILY OF MALUD,
1001,THE LILY OF MALUD,"It shines without sound, as a star in space."
1002,THE LILY OF MALUD,
1003,THE LILY OF MALUD,And the silence all around that solitary place
1004,THE LILY OF MALUD,Is like silence in a dream; till a sudden flashing gleam
1005,THE LILY OF MALUD,Down their dark faces flies; and their lips fall apart
1006,THE LILY OF MALUD,And their glimmering great eyes with excitement dart
1007,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And their fingers, clutching the branches they were touching,"
1008,THE LILY OF MALUD,Shake and arouse hissing leaves on the boughs.
1009,THE LILY OF MALUD,
1010,THE LILY OF MALUD,And they whisper aswoon: Did it move in the moon?
1011,THE LILY OF MALUD,
1012,THE LILY OF MALUD,O it moved as it grew!
1013,THE LILY OF MALUD,"It is moving, opening, with calm and gradual will"
1014,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And their bodies where they cling are shadowed and still,"
1015,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And with marvel they mark that the mud now is dark,"
1016,THE LILY OF MALUD,"For the unfolding flower, like a goddess in her power,"
1017,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Challenges the moon with a light of her own,"
1018,THE LILY OF MALUD,"That lovelily grows as the petals unclose,"
1019,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Wider, more wide with an awful inward pride"
1020,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Till the heart of it breaks, and stilled is their breath,"
1021,THE LILY OF MALUD,For the radiance it makes is as wonderful as death.
1022,THE LILY OF MALUD,
1023,THE LILY OF MALUD,The morning's crimson stain tinges their ashen brows
1024,THE LILY OF MALUD,As they part the last boughs and slowly step again
1025,THE LILY OF MALUD,"On to the village grass, and chill and languid pass"
1026,THE LILY OF MALUD,Into the huts to sleep.
1027,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Brief slumber, yet so deep"
1028,THE LILY OF MALUD,"That, when they wake to day, darkness and splendour seem"
1029,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Broken and far-away, a faint miraculous dream;"
1030,THE LILY OF MALUD,And when those maidens rise they are as they ever were
1031,THE LILY OF MALUD,Save only for a rare shade of trouble in their eyes.
1032,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And the surly thick-lipped men, as they sit about their huts"
1033,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Making drums out of guts, grunting gruffly now and then,"
1034,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Carving sticks of ivory, stretching shields of wrinkled skin,"
1035,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Smoothing sinister and thin squatting gods of ebony,"
1036,THE LILY OF MALUD,Chip and grunt and do not see.
1037,THE LILY OF MALUD,"But each mother, silently,"
1038,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Longer than her wont stays shut in the dimness of her hut,"
1039,THE LILY OF MALUD,"For she feels a brooding cloud of memory in the air,"
1040,THE LILY OF MALUD,A lingering thing there that makes her sit bowed
1041,THE LILY OF MALUD,"With hollow shining eyes, as the night-fire dies,"
1042,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And stare softly at the ember, and try to remember,"
1043,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Something sorrowful and far, something sweet and vaguely seen"
1044,THE LILY OF MALUD,Like an early evening star when the sky is pale green:
1045,THE LILY OF MALUD,"A quiet silver tower that climbed in an hour,"
1046,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Or a ghost like a flower, or a flower like a queen:"
1047,THE LILY OF MALUD,Something holy in the past that came and did not last....
1048,THE LILY OF MALUD,But she knows not what it was.

1073,I,Of my quiet attic room.
1074,I,"France goes rolling all around,"
1075,I,Fledged with forest May has crowned.
1076,I,"And I puff my pipe, calm-hearted,"
1077,I,"Thinking how the fighting started,"
1078,I,"Wondering when we'll ever end it,"
1079,I,"Back to Hell with Kaiser send it,"
1080,I,"Gag the noise, pack up and go,"

1091,II,Somewhere then I'll see your face
1092,II,Turning back to bid me follow
1093,II,"Where I wag my arms and hollo,"
1094,II,Over hedges hasting after
1095,II,"Crooked smile and baffling laughter,"
1096,II,"Running tireless, floating, leaping,"
1097,II,"Down your web-hung woods and valleys,"
1098,II,"Garden glooms and hornbeam alleys,"
1099,II,"Where the glowworm stars are peeping,"
1100,II,"Till I find you, quiet as stone"

1109,III,In the starving winter weather.
1110,III,We've been glad because we knew
1111,III,Time's too short and friends are few.
1112,III,We've been sad because we missed
1113,III,One whose yellow head was kissed
1114,III,"By the gods, who thought about him"
1115,III,Till they couldn't do without him.
1116,III,Now he's here again; I've seen
1117,III,"Soldier David dressed in green,"
1118,III,Standing in a wood that swings
1119,III,To the madrigal he sings.
1120,III,"He's come back, all mirth and glory,"
1121,III,Like the prince in a fairy story.
1122,III,Winter called him far away;
1123,III,Blossoms bring him home with May.

1131,IV,With a cloud on either hand.
1132,IV,"Out in Wales, you'll say, he marches"
1133,IV,Arm-in-arm with oaks and larches;
1134,IV,"Hides all night in hilly nooks,"
1135,IV,Laughs at dawn in tumbling brooks.
1136,IV,"Yet, it's certain, here he teaches"
1137,IV,Outpost-schemes to groups of beeches.
1138,IV,"And I'm sure, as here I stand,"
1139,IV,"That he shines through every land,"

1192,THE DRAGON AND THE UNDYING,"He lusts to break the loveliness of spires,"

1220,TO VICTORY,"I am not sad; only I long for lustre,--"
1221,TO VICTORY,Tired of the greys and browns and the leafless ash.
1222,TO VICTORY,I would have hours that move like a glitter of dancers
1223,TO VICTORY,Far from the angry guns that boom and flash.
1224,TO VICTORY,
1225,TO VICTORY,"Return, musical, gay with blossom and fleetness,"
1226,TO VICTORY,Days when my sight shall be clear and my heart rejoice;

1236,'THEY',The Bishop tells us: 'When the boys come back
1237,'THEY',They will not be the same; for they'll have fought
1238,'THEY',In a just cause: they lead the last attack
1239,'THEY',On Anti-Christ; their comrades' blood has bought
1240,'THEY',New right to breed an honourable race.
1241,'THEY',They have challenged Death and dared him face to face.'
1242,'THEY',
1243,'THEY','We're none of us the same!' the boys reply.
1244,'THEY',For George lost both his legs; and Bill's stone blind;
1245,'THEY',Poor Jim's shot through the lungs and like to die;

1256,'IN THE PINK',"Then scrawled his name: 'Your loving sweet-heart, Willie'"
1257,'IN THE PINK',With crosses for a hug. He'd had a drink
1258,'IN THE PINK',"Of rum and tea; and, though the barn was chilly,"
1259,'IN THE PINK',For once his blood ran warm; he had pay to spend.
1260,'IN THE PINK',Winter was passing; soon the year would mend.
1261,'IN THE PINK',
1262,'IN THE PINK',He couldn't sleep that night. Stiff in the dark
1263,'IN THE PINK',"He groaned and thought of Sundays at the farm,"
1264,'IN THE PINK',When he'd go out as cheerful as a lark
1265,'IN THE PINK',In his best suit to wander arm-in-arm
1266,'IN THE PINK',"With brown-eyed Gwen, and whisper in her ear"
1267,'IN THE PINK',"The simple, silly things she liked to hear."
1268,'IN THE PINK',
1269,'IN THE PINK',And then he thought: to-morrow night we trudge
1270,'IN THE PINK',"Up to the trenches, and my boots are rotten."
1271,'IN THE PINK',"Five miles of stodgy clay and freezing sludge,"
1272,'IN THE PINK',And everything but wretchedness forgotten.
1273,'IN THE PINK',To-night he's in the pink; but soon he'll die.

1281,HAUNTED,"Evening was in the wood, louring with storm."
1282,HAUNTED,A time of drought had sucked the weedy pool
1283,HAUNTED,And baked the channels; birds had done with song.
1284,HAUNTED,"Thirst was a dream of fountains in the moon,"
1285,HAUNTED,Or willow-music blown across the water
1286,HAUNTED,Leisurely sliding on by weir and mill.
1287,HAUNTED,
1288,HAUNTED,"Uneasy was the man who wandered, brooding,"
1289,HAUNTED,His face a little whiter than the dusk.
1290,HAUNTED,A drone of sultry wings flicker'd in his head.
1291,HAUNTED,
1292,HAUNTED,The end of sunset burning thro' the boughs
1293,HAUNTED,Died in a smear of red; exhausted hours
1294,HAUNTED,"Cumber'd, and ugly sorrows hemmed him in."
1295,HAUNTED,
1296,HAUNTED,"He thought: 'Somewhere there's thunder,' as he strove"
1297,HAUNTED,"To shake off dread; he dared not look behind him,"
1298,HAUNTED,"But stood, the sweat of horror on his face."
1299,HAUNTED,
1300,HAUNTED,"He blundered down a path, trampling on thistles,"
1301,HAUNTED,In sudden race to leave the ghostly trees.
1302,HAUNTED,"And: 'Soon I'll be in open fields,' he thought,"
1303,HAUNTED,"And half remembered starlight on the meadows,"
1304,HAUNTED,"Scent of mown grass and voices of tired men,"
1305,HAUNTED,Fading along the field-paths; home and sleep
1306,HAUNTED,"And cool-swept upland spaces, whispering leaves,"
1307,HAUNTED,And far off the long churring night-jar's note.
1308,HAUNTED,
1309,HAUNTED,"But something in the wood, trying to daunt him,"
1310,HAUNTED,Led him confused in circles through the brake.
1311,HAUNTED,"He was forgetting his old wretched folly,"
1312,HAUNTED,And freedom was his need; his throat was choking;
1313,HAUNTED,"Barbed brambles gripped and clawed him round his legs,"
1314,HAUNTED,And he floundered over snags and hidden stumps.
1315,HAUNTED,Mumbling: 'I will get out! I must get out!'
1316,HAUNTED,"Butting and thrusting up the baffling gloom,"
1317,HAUNTED,"Pausing to listen in a space 'twixt thorns,"
1318,HAUNTED,"He peers around with boding, frantic eyes."
1319,HAUNTED,An evil creature in the twilight looping
1320,HAUNTED,"Flapped blindly in his face. Beating it off,"
1321,HAUNTED,"He screeched in terror, and straightway something clambered"
1322,HAUNTED,"Heavily from an oak, and dropped, bent double,"
1323,HAUNTED,"To shamble at him zigzag, squat and bestial."
1324,HAUNTED,
1325,HAUNTED,"Headlong he charges down the wood, and falls"
1326,HAUNTED,With roaring brain--agony--the snapt spark--
1327,HAUNTED,And blots of green and purple in his eyes.
1328,HAUNTED,"Then the slow fingers groping on his neck,"
1329,HAUNTED,And at his heart the strangling clasp of death.

1334,THE DEATH-BED,
1335,THE DEATH-BED,
1336,THE DEATH-BED,He drowsed and was aware of silence heaped
1337,THE DEATH-BED,"Round him, unshaken as the steadfast walls;"
1338,THE DEATH-BED,"Aqueous like floating rays of amber light,"
1339,THE DEATH-BED,"Soaring and quivering in the wings of sleep,--"
1340,THE DEATH-BED,Silence and safety; and his mortal shore
1341,THE DEATH-BED,"Lipped by the inward, moonless waves of death."
1342,THE DEATH-BED,
1343,THE DEATH-BED,Some one was holding water to his mouth.
1344,THE DEATH-BED,"He swallowed, unresisting; moaned and dropped"
1345,THE DEATH-BED,Through crimson gloom to darkness; and forgot
1346,THE DEATH-BED,The opiate throb and ache that was his wound.
1347,THE DEATH-BED,"Water--calm, sliding green above the weir;"
1348,THE DEATH-BED,"Water--a sky-lit alley for his boat,"
1349,THE DEATH-BED,"Bird-voiced, and bordered with reflected flowers"
1350,THE DEATH-BED,"And shaken hues of summer: drifting down,"
1351,THE DEATH-BED,"He dipped contented oars, and sighed, and slept."
1352,THE DEATH-BED,
1353,THE DEATH-BED,"Night, with a gust of wind, was in the ward,"
1354,THE DEATH-BED,Blowing the curtain to a glimmering curve.
1355,THE DEATH-BED,Night. He was blind; he could not see the stars
1356,THE DEATH-BED,Glinting among the wraiths of wandering cloud;
1357,THE DEATH-BED,"Queer blots of colour, purple, scarlet, green,"
1358,THE DEATH-BED,Flickered and faded in his drowning eyes.
1359,THE DEATH-BED,
1360,THE DEATH-BED,Rain; he could hear it rustling through the dark;
1361,THE DEATH-BED,Fragrance and passionless music woven as one;
1362,THE DEATH-BED,Warm rain on drooping roses; pattering showers
1363,THE DEATH-BED,That soak the woods; not the harsh rain that sweeps
1364,THE DEATH-BED,"Behind the thunder, but a trickling peace"
1365,THE DEATH-BED,Gently and slowly washing life away.
1366,THE DEATH-BED,
1367,THE DEATH-BED,*       *       *       *       *
1368,THE DEATH-BED,
1369,THE DEATH-BED,"He stirred, shifting his body; then the pain"
1370,THE DEATH-BED,"Leaped like a prowling beast, and gripped and tore"
1371,THE DEATH-BED,His groping dreams with grinding claws and fangs.
1372,THE DEATH-BED,But some one was beside him; soon he lay
1373,THE DEATH-BED,Shuddering because that evil thing had passed.
1374,THE DEATH-BED,"And Death, who'd stepped toward him, paused and stared."
1375,THE DEATH-BED,
1376,THE DEATH-BED,Light many lamps and gather round his bed.
1377,THE DEATH-BED,"Lend him your eyes, warm blood, and will to live."
1378,THE DEATH-BED,Speak to him; rouse him; you may save him yet.
1379,THE DEATH-BED,He's young; he hated war; how should he die
1380,THE DEATH-BED,When cruel old campaigners win safe through?
1381,THE DEATH-BED,
1382,THE DEATH-BED,"But Death replied: 'I choose him.' So he went,"
1383,THE DEATH-BED,And there was silence in the summer night;
1384,THE DEATH-BED,Silence and safety; and the veils of sleep.
1385,THE DEATH-BED,"Then, far away, the thudding of the guns."

1916,THE TOWER,
1917,THE TOWER,"Then Jesus lifted his voice like a fountain in an ocean of tears,"

1919,THE TOWER,"But Judas wound down the turret, creeping from floor to floor,"
1920,THE TOWER,"And would fly; but one leaning, weeping, barred him beside the door."
1921,THE TOWER,And he knew her by her ruddy garment and two yet-watching men:
1922,THE TOWER,"Mary of Seven Evils, Mary Magdalen."
1923,THE TOWER,And he was frighted at her. She sighed: 'I dreamed him dead.
1924,THE TOWER,We sell the body for silver....'
1925,THE TOWER,Then Judas cried out and fled
1926,THE TOWER,Forth into the night!... The moon had begun to set:
1927,THE TOWER,"A drear, deft wind went sifting, setting the dust afret;"
1928,THE TOWER,Into the heart of the city Judas ran on and prayed
1929,THE TOWER,To stern Jehovah lest his deed make him afraid.
1930,THE TOWER,
1931,THE TOWER,"But in the tiny lantern, hanging as if on air,"
1932,THE TOWER,The disciples sat unspeaking. Amaze and peace were there.

1998,EVERY THING,"Of Crockery and Cutlery, those kind"
1999,EVERY THING,Reposeful Teraphim
2000,EVERY THING,Of his domestic happiness; the Stool
2001,EVERY THING,"He sat on, or the Door he entered through:"
2002,EVERY THING,"He has not thanked them, overbearing fool!"
2003,EVERY THING,What is he coming to?
2004,EVERY THING,
2005,EVERY THING,But you should listen to the talk of these.
2006,EVERY THING,"Honest they are, and patient they have kept,"
2007,EVERY THING,Served him without his 'Thank you' or his 'Please'.
2008,EVERY THING,I often heard
2009,EVERY THING,"The gentle Bed, a sigh between each word,"
2010,EVERY THING,"Murmuring, before I slept."
2011,EVERY THING,"The Candle, as I blew it, cried aloud,"
2012,EVERY THING,"Then bowed,"
2013,EVERY THING,And in a smoky argument
2014,EVERY THING,Into the darkness went.
2015,EVERY THING,
2016,EVERY THING,The Kettle puffed a tentacle of breath:--
2017,EVERY THING,"'Pooh! I have boiled his water, I don't know"
2018,EVERY THING,Why; and he always says I boil too slow.
2019,EVERY THING,"He never calls me ""Sukie, dear,"" and oh,"
2020,EVERY THING,I wonder why I squander my desire
2021,EVERY THING,Sitting submissive on his kitchen fire.'
2022,EVERY THING,
2023,EVERY THING,Now the old Copper Basin suddenly
2024,EVERY THING,"Rattled and tumbled from the shelf,"
2025,EVERY THING,Bumping and crying: 'I can fall by myself;
2026,EVERY THING,Without a woman's hand
2027,EVERY THING,"To patronize and coax and flatter me,"
2028,EVERY THING,I understand
2029,EVERY THING,The lean and poise of gravitable land.'
2030,EVERY THING,"It gave a raucous and tumultuous shout,"
2031,EVERY THING,"Twisted itself convulsively about,"
2032,EVERY THING,"Rested upon the floor, and, while I stare,"
2033,EVERY THING,It stares and grins at me.
2034,EVERY THING,
2035,EVERY THING,The old impetuous Gas above my head
2036,EVERY THING,"Begins irascibly to flare and fret,"
2037,EVERY THING,"Wheezing into its epileptic jet,"
2038,EVERY THING,Reminding me I ought to go to bed.
2039,EVERY THING,
2040,EVERY THING,The Rafters creak; an Empty-Cupboard door
2041,EVERY THING,Swings open; now a wild Plank of the floor
2042,EVERY THING,"Breaks from its joist, and leaps behind my foot."
2043,EVERY THING,Down from the chimney half a pound of Soot
2044,EVERY THING,"Tumbles, and lies, and shakes itself again."
2045,EVERY THING,The Putty cracks against the window-pane.
2046,EVERY THING,A piece of Paper in the basket shoves
2047,EVERY THING,"Another piece, and toward the bottom moves."
2048,EVERY THING,"My independent Pencil, while I write,"
2049,EVERY THING,Breaks at the point: the ruminating Clock
2050,EVERY THING,"Stirs all its body and begins to rock,"
2051,EVERY THING,"Warning the waiting presence of the Night,"
2052,EVERY THING,"Strikes the dead hour, and tumbles to the plain"
2053,EVERY THING,Ticking of ordinary work again.
2054,EVERY THING,
2055,EVERY THING,"You do well to remind me, and I praise"
2056,EVERY THING,Your strangely individual foreign ways.
2057,EVERY THING,You call me from myself to recognize
2058,EVERY THING,Companionship in your unselfish eyes.
2059,EVERY THING,
2060,EVERY THING,"I want your dear acquaintances, although"
2061,EVERY THING,"I pass you arrogantly over, throw"
2062,EVERY THING,"Your lovely sounds, and squander them along"
2063,EVERY THING,My busy days. I'll do you no more wrong.
2064,EVERY THING,
2065,EVERY THING,"Purr for me, Sukie, like a faithful cat."
2066,EVERY THING,"You, my well trampled Boots, and you, my Hat,"
2067,EVERY THING,"Remain my friends: I feel, though I don't speak,"
2068,EVERY THING,Your touch grow kindlier from week to week.
2069,EVERY THING,It well becomes our mutual happiness
2070,EVERY THING,To go toward the same end more or less.
2071,EVERY THING,"There is not much dissimilarity,"
2072,EVERY THING,"Not much to choose, I know it well, in fine,"
2073,EVERY THING,"Between the purposes of you and me,"
2074,EVERY THING,"And your eventual Rubbish Heap, and mine."

2078,SOLITUDE,SOLITUDE
2079,SOLITUDE,
2080,SOLITUDE,
2081,SOLITUDE,"When you have tidied all things for the night,"
2082,SOLITUDE,"And while your thoughts are fading to their sleep,"
2083,SOLITUDE,"You'll pause a moment in the late firelight,"
2084,SOLITUDE,Too sorrowful to weep.
2085,SOLITUDE,
2086,SOLITUDE,The large and gentle furniture has stood
2087,SOLITUDE,In sympathetic silence all the day
2088,SOLITUDE,With that old kindness of domestic wood;
2089,SOLITUDE,Nevertheless the haunted room will say:
2090,SOLITUDE,'Some one must be away.'
2091,SOLITUDE,
2092,SOLITUDE,"The little dog rolls over half awake,"
2093,SOLITUDE,"Stretches his paws, yawns, looking up at you,"
2094,SOLITUDE,"Wags his tail very slightly for your sake,"
2095,SOLITUDE,That you may feel he is unhappy too.
2096,SOLITUDE,
2097,SOLITUDE,"A distant engine whistles, or the floor"
2098,SOLITUDE,"Creaks, or the wandering night-wind bangs a door."
2099,SOLITUDE,
2100,SOLITUDE,Silence is scattered like a broken glass.
2101,SOLITUDE,"The minutes prick their ears and run about,"
2102,SOLITUDE,Then one by one subside again and pass
2103,SOLITUDE,"Sedately in, monotonously out."
2104,SOLITUDE,
2105,SOLITUDE,You bend your head and wipe away a tear.
2106,SOLITUDE,Solitude walks one heavy step more near.

2116,I,"Hurry, or it will try to creep away."
2117,I,Out in the country every one is wise:
2118,I,We can be only wise on Saturday.
2119,I,"There you are waiting, little friendly house:"
2120,I,"Those are your chimney-stacks with you between,"
2121,I,"Surrounded by old trees and strolling cows,"
2122,I,Staring through all your windows at the green.
2123,I,Your homely floor is creaking for our tread;
2124,I,The smiling tea-pot with contented spout
2125,I,"Thinks of the boiling water, and the bread"
2126,I,Longs for the butter. All their hands are out
2127,I,"To greet us, and the gentle blankets seem"
2128,I,"Purring and crooning: 'Lie in us, and dream.'"
2129,I,
2130,I,
2131,II,II
2132,II,
2133,II,"The key will stammer, and the door reply,"
2134,II,"The hall wake, yawn, and smile; the torpid stair"
2135,II,"Will grumble at our feet, the table cry:"
2136,II,'Fetch my belongings for me; I am bare.'
2137,II,A clatter! Something in the attic falls.
2138,II,A ghost has lifted up his robes and fled.
2139,II,The loitering shadows move along the walls;
2140,II,Then silence very slowly lifts his head.
2141,II,The starling with impatient screech has flown
2142,II,"The chimney, and is watching from the tree."
2143,II,They thought us gone for ever: mouse alone
2144,II,Stops in the middle of the floor to see.
2145,II,"Now all you idle things, resume your toil."
2146,II,"Hearth, put your flames on. Sulky kettle, boil."
2147,II,

2149,III,III
2150,III,
2151,III,Contented evening; comfortable joys;
2152,III,"The snoozing fire, and all the fields are still:"
2153,III,"Tranquil delight, no purpose, and no noise--"
2154,III,Unless the slow wind flowing round the hill.
2155,III,'Murry' (the kettle) dozes; little mouse
2156,III,Is rambling prudently about the floor.
2157,III,There's lovely conversation in this house:
2158,III,Words become princes that were slaves before.
2159,III,What a sweet atmosphere for you and me
2160,III,The people that have been here left behind....
2161,III,"Oh, but I fear it may turn out to be"
2162,III,"Built of a dream, erected in the mind:"
2163,III,"So if we speak too loud, we may awaken"
2164,III,"To find it vanished, and ourselves mistaken."
2165,III,
2166,III,
2167,IV,IV
2168,IV,
2169,IV,Lift up the curtain carefully. All the trees
2170,IV,Stand in the dark like drowsy sentinels.
2171,IV,The oak is talkative to-night; he tells
2172,IV,The little bushes crowding at his knees
2173,IV,"That formidable, hard, voluminous"
2174,IV,History of growth from acorn into age.
2175,IV,They titter like school-children; they arouse
2176,IV,"Their comrades, who exclaim: 'He is very sage.'"
2177,IV,"Look how the moon is staring through that cloud,"
2178,IV,Laying and lifting idle streaks of light.
2179,IV,"O hark! was that the monstrous wind, so loud"
2180,IV,"And sudden, prowling always through the night?"
2181,IV,"Let down the shaking curtain. They are queer,"
2182,IV,Those foreigners. They and we live so near.
2183,IV,
2184,IV,
2185,V,V
2186,V,
2187,V,"Come, come to bed. The shadows move about,"
2188,V,And some one seems to overhear our talk.
2189,V,The fire is low; the candles flicker out;
2190,V,The ghosts of former tenants want to walk.
2191,V,Already they are shuffling through the gloom.
2192,V,I felt an old man touch my shoulder-blade;
2193,V,"Once he was married here; they love this room,"
2194,V,He and his woman and the child they made.
2195,V,"Dead, dead, they are, yet some familiar sound,"
2196,V,"Creeping along the brink of happy life,"
2197,V,Revives their memory from under ground--
2198,V,The farmer and his troublesome old wife.
2199,V,"Let us be going: as we climb the stairs,"
2200,V,They'll sit down in our warm half-empty chairs.
2201,V,
2202,V,
2203,VI,VI
2204,VI,
2205,VI,Morning! Wake up! Awaken! All the boughs
2206,VI,Are rippling on the air across the green.
2207,VI,The youngest birds are singing to the house.
2208,VI,Blood of the world!--and is the country clean?
2209,VI,Disturb the precinct. Cool it with a shout.
2210,VI,Sing as you trundle down to light the fire.
2211,VI,Turn the encumbering shadows tumbling out.
2212,VI,And fill the chambers with a new desire.
2213,VI,"Life is no good, unless the morning brings"
2214,VI,White happiness and quick delight of day.
2215,VI,These half-inanimate domestic things
2216,VI,"Must all be useful, or must go away."
2217,VI,"Coffee, be fragrant. Porridge in my plate,"
2218,VI,Increase the vigour to fulfil my fate.
2219,VI,

2221,VII,VII
2222,VII,
2223,VII,The fresh air moves like water round a boat.
2224,VII,The white clouds wander. Let us wander too.
2225,VII,"The whining, wavering plover flap and float."
2226,VII,That crow is flying after that cuckoo.
2227,VII,Look! Look!... They're gone. What are the great trees calling?
2228,VII,"Just come a little farther, by that edge"
2229,VII,"Of green, to where the stormy ploughland, falling"
2230,VII,"Wave upon wave, is lapping to the hedge."
2231,VII,"Oh, what a lovely bank! Give me your hand."
2232,VII,Lie down and press your heart against the ground.
2233,VII,"Let us both listen till we understand,"
2234,VII,"Each through the other, every natural sound...."
2235,VII,"I can't hear anything to-day, can you,"
2236,VII,"But, far and near: 'Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!'?"
2237,VII,
2238,VII,
2239,VIII,VIII
2240,VIII,
2241,VIII,"The everlasting grass--how bright, how cool!"
2242,VIII,"The day has gone too suddenly, too soon."
2243,VIII,There's something white and shiny in that pool--
2244,VIII,"Throw in a stone, and you will hit the moon."
2245,VIII,"Listen, the church-bell ringing! Do not say"
2246,VIII,We must go back to-morrow to our work.
2247,VIII,We'll tell them we are dead: we died to-day.
2248,VIII,We're lazy. We're too happy. We will shirk.
2249,VIII,We're cows. We're kettles. We'll be anything
2250,VIII,Except the manikins of time and fear.
2251,VIII,"We'll start away to-morrow wandering,"
2252,VIII,And nobody will notice in a year....
2253,VIII,Now the great sun is slipping under ground.
2254,VIII,Grip firmly!--How the earth is whirling round!
2255,VIII,
2256,VIII,
2257,IX,IX
2258,IX,
2259,IX,Be staid; be careful; and be not too free.
2260,IX,Temptation to enjoy your liberty
2261,IX,"May rise against you, break into a crime,"
2262,IX,And smash the habit of employing Time.
2263,IX,It serves no purpose that the careful clock
2264,IX,"Mark the appointment, the officious train"
2265,IX,"Hurry to keep it, if the minutes mock"
2266,IX,Loud in your ear: 'Late. Late. Late. Late again.'
2267,IX,Week-end is very well on Saturday:
2268,IX,On Monday it's a different affair--
2269,IX,"A little episode, a trivial stay"
2270,IX,"In some oblivious spot somehow, somewhere."
2271,IX,On Sunday night we hardly laugh or speak:
2272,IX,Week-end begins to merge itself in Week.
2273,IX,

2275,X,X
2276,X,
2277,X,"Pack up the house, and close the creaking door."
2278,X,The fields are dull this morning in the rain.
2279,X,It's difficult to leave that homely floor.
2280,X,Wave a light hand; we will return again.
2281,X,"(What was that bird?) Good-bye, ecstatic tree,"
2282,X,"Floating, bursting, and breathing on the air."
2283,X,The lonely farm is wondering that we
2284,X,Can leave. How every window seems to stare!
2285,X,That bag is heavy. Share it for a bit.
2286,X,You like that gentle swashing of the ground
2287,X,As we tread?...
2288,X,It is over. Now we sit
2289,X,Reading the morning paper in the sound
2290,X,Of the debilitating heavy train.
2291,X,"London again, again. London again."

2299,THE BIRD AT DAWN,In the dawn as I was going:
2300,THE BIRD AT DAWN,A bird can carry all the sky
2301,THE BIRD AT DAWN,In that little button glowing.
2302,THE BIRD AT DAWN,
2303,THE BIRD AT DAWN,Never in my life I went
2304,THE BIRD AT DAWN,So deep into the firmament.
2305,THE BIRD AT DAWN,
2306,THE BIRD AT DAWN,"He was standing on a tree,"
2307,THE BIRD AT DAWN,All in blossom overflowing;
2308,THE BIRD AT DAWN,"And he purposely looked hard at me,"
2309,THE BIRD AT DAWN,"At first, as if to question merrily:"
2310,THE BIRD AT DAWN,'Where are you going?'
2311,THE BIRD AT DAWN,But next some far more serious thing to say:
2312,THE BIRD AT DAWN,"I could not answer, could not look away."
2313,THE BIRD AT DAWN,
2314,THE BIRD AT DAWN,"Oh, that hard, round, and so distracting eye:"
2315,THE BIRD AT DAWN,Little mirror of all sky!--
2316,THE BIRD AT DAWN,And then the after-song another tree
2317,THE BIRD AT DAWN,"Held, and sent radiating back on me."
2318,THE BIRD AT DAWN,
2319,THE BIRD AT DAWN,"If no man had invented human word,"
2320,THE BIRD AT DAWN,And a bird-song had been
2321,THE BIRD AT DAWN,"The only way to utter what we mean,"
2322,THE BIRD AT DAWN,"What would we men have heard,"
2323,THE BIRD AT DAWN,"What understood, what seen,"
2324,THE BIRD AT DAWN,"Between the trills and pauses, in between"

2445,[POEM NO.] VI,
2446,[POEM NO.] VI,"I went down by the waters, and a bird"
2447,[POEM NO.] VI,Sang with your voice in all the unknown tones

2450,[POEM NO.] VI,
2451,[POEM NO.] VI,"I went into the house, and shut the door"
2452,[POEM NO.] VI,"To be alone, but you were there with me;"

2653,GOLIATH AND DAVID,Smooth pebbles from the brook:
2654,GOLIATH AND DAVID,Out between the lines he went
2655,GOLIATH AND DAVID,"To that one-sided tournament,"
2656,GOLIATH AND DAVID,A shepherd boy who stood out fine
2657,GOLIATH AND DAVID,And young to fight a Philistine
2658,GOLIATH AND DAVID,Clad all in brazen mail. He swears

2665,GOLIATH AND DAVID,Striding within javelin range

2667,GOLIATH AND DAVID,Goodly-faced boy so proud of strength.
2668,GOLIATH AND DAVID,David's clear eye measures the length;
2669,GOLIATH AND DAVID,"With hand thrust back, he cramps one knee,"
2670,GOLIATH AND DAVID,"Poises a moment thoughtfully,"
2671,GOLIATH AND DAVID,And hurls with a long vengeful swing.
2672,GOLIATH AND DAVID,"The pebble, humming from the sling"
2673,GOLIATH AND DAVID,"Like a wild bee, flies a sure line;"
2674,GOLIATH AND DAVID,For the forehead of the Philistine;
2675,GOLIATH AND DAVID,Then ... but there comes a brazen clink
2676,GOLIATH AND DAVID,And quicker than a man can think
2677,GOLIATH AND DAVID,Goliath's shield parries each cast.
2678,GOLIATH AND DAVID,Clang! clang! and clang! was David's last

2694,GOLIATH AND DAVID,"(God's eyes are dim, His ears are shut.)"
2695,GOLIATH AND DAVID,One cruel backhand sabre cut--
2696,GOLIATH AND DAVID,"'I'm hit! I'm killed!' young David cries,"
2697,GOLIATH AND DAVID,"Throws blindly forward, chokes ... and dies."

3233,THE PIGEONS,"Like a cloud blown from the blue north were lost,"
3234,THE PIGEONS,"Vanishing and returning ever again,"
3235,THE PIGEONS,Small cloud following cloud across the flame
3236,THE PIGEONS,That clear and meagre burned and burned away

3247,THE PIGEONS,"And stranger, lovelier and crueller grew;"
3248,THE PIGEONS,"Pouring her silver that cold silver through,"
3249,THE PIGEONS,The moon made all the dim flower bright again.

3257,THE PIGEONS,And day came and they woke and saw all plain
3258,THE PIGEONS,"Though still the frost-flower blinded the window pane,"
3259,THE PIGEONS,"And touched their mother and touched her hand in vain,"
3260,THE PIGEONS,And wondered why she woke not when they woke;
3261,THE PIGEONS,And wondered what it was their sleep that broke
3262,THE PIGEONS,"When hand in hand they stared and stared, so frightened;"
3263,THE PIGEONS,"They feared and waited, and waited all day long,"
3264,THE PIGEONS,"While all the shadows went and the day brightened,"

3271,THE PIGEONS,"Cold, cold,"
3272,THE PIGEONS,"Hungering as the long slow hours grew old,"

3274,THE PIGEONS,"Beyond their thought, or but beyond their reach."
3275,THE PIGEONS,The soft blue pigeons all the afternoon
3276,THE PIGEONS,"Sunned themselves on the roof or rose at play,"
3277,THE PIGEONS,Then with the shrinking light fluttered away;
3278,THE PIGEONS,"And once more came the icy-hearted moon,"
3279,THE PIGEONS,Staring down at the frightened children there
3280,THE PIGEONS,That could but shiver and stare.
3281,THE PIGEONS,
3282,THE PIGEONS,"How many hours, how many days, who knows?"
3283,THE PIGEONS,Neighbours there were who thought they had gone away
3284,THE PIGEONS,To return some luckier or luckless day.
3285,THE PIGEONS,No sound came from the room: the cold air froze
3286,THE PIGEONS,The very echo of the children's sighs.
3287,THE PIGEONS,"And what they saw within each other's eyes,"
3288,THE PIGEONS,Or heard each other's heart say as they peered
3289,THE PIGEONS,"At the dead mother lying there, and feared"
3290,THE PIGEONS,"That she might wake, and then might never wake,"
3291,THE PIGEONS,"Who knows, who knows?"
3292,THE PIGEONS,None heard a living sound their silence break.
3293,THE PIGEONS,
3294,THE PIGEONS,"In those cold days and nights how many birds,"
3295,THE PIGEONS,"Flittering above the fields and streams all frozen,"
3296,THE PIGEONS,Watched hungrily the tended flocks and herds--
3297,THE PIGEONS,Earth's chosen nourished by earth's wise self-chosen!
3298,THE PIGEONS,How many birds suddenly stiffened and died
3299,THE PIGEONS,"With no plaint cried,"
3300,THE PIGEONS,The starved heart ceasing when the pale sun ceased!
3301,THE PIGEONS,And when the new day stepped from the same cold East
3302,THE PIGEONS,"The dead birds lay in the light on the snow-flecked field,"
3303,THE PIGEONS,Their song and beautiful free winging stilled.
3304,THE PIGEONS,
3305,THE PIGEONS,"I walked under snow-sprinkled hills at night,"
3306,THE PIGEONS,And starry sprinkled skies deep blue and bright.
3307,THE PIGEONS,The keen wind thrust with his knife against the thin
3308,THE PIGEONS,"Breast of the wood as I went tingling by,"
3309,THE PIGEONS,"And heard a weak cheep-cheep,--no more--the cry"
3310,THE PIGEONS,Of a bird that crouched the smitten wood within ...
3311,THE PIGEONS,But no one heeded that sharp spiritual cry
3312,THE PIGEONS,"Of the two children in their misery,"
3313,THE PIGEONS,When in the cold and famished night death's shade
3314,THE PIGEONS,More terrible the moon's cold shadows made.
3315,THE PIGEONS,How was it none could hear
3316,THE PIGEONS,"That bodiless crying, birdlike, sharp and clear?"
3317,THE PIGEONS,
3318,THE PIGEONS,"I cannot think what they, unanswered, thought"
3319,THE PIGEONS,When the night came again and shadows moved
3320,THE PIGEONS,"As the moon through the ice-flower stared and roved,"
3321,THE PIGEONS,And that unyielding Shadow came again.
3322,THE PIGEONS,That Shadow came again unseen and caught
3323,THE PIGEONS,"The children as they sat listening in vain,"
3324,THE PIGEONS,Their starved hearts failing ere the Shadow removed.
3325,THE PIGEONS,And when the new morn stepped from the same cold East
3326,THE PIGEONS,"They lay unawakening in the barren light,"
3327,THE PIGEONS,"Their song and their imaginations bright,"
3328,THE PIGEONS,Their pains and fears and all bewilderment ceased....
3329,THE PIGEONS,While the brief sun gave
3330,THE PIGEONS,"New beauty to the death-flower of the frost,"
3331,THE PIGEONS,"And pigeons in the frore air swooped and tossed,"
3332,THE PIGEONS,"And glad eyes were more glad, and grave less grave."
3333,THE PIGEONS,
3334,THE PIGEONS,"There is not pity enough in heaven or earth,"
3335,THE PIGEONS,"There is not love enough, if children die"
3336,THE PIGEONS,"Like famished birds--oh, less mercifully."
3337,THE PIGEONS,A great wrong's done when such as these go forth
3338,THE PIGEONS,"Into the starless dark, broken and bruised,"
3339,THE PIGEONS,"With mind and sweet affection all confused,"
3340,THE PIGEONS,And horror closing round them as they go.
3341,THE PIGEONS,There is not pity enough!
3342,THE PIGEONS,
3343,THE PIGEONS,"And I have made, children, these verses for you,"
3344,THE PIGEONS,"Lasting a little longer than your breath,"
3345,THE PIGEONS,Because I have been haunted with your death:
3346,THE PIGEONS,So men are driven to things they hate to do.
3347,THE PIGEONS,"Jesus, forgive us all our happiness,"
3348,THE PIGEONS,As Thou dost blot out all our miseries.

3434,THE MIDLANDS,Abed between cool walls I watch the host
3435,THE MIDLANDS,"Of the slow stars lit over Gloucester plain,"
3436,THE MIDLANDS,And drowsily the habit of these most
3437,THE MIDLANDS,"Beloved of English lands moves in my brain,"

3439,THE MIDLANDS,Save when the foxes from the spinneys bark.

3455,THE MIDLANDS,"Deep in his heart the beauty of his power,"

3464,THE MIDLANDS,"By men who somehow moved in comely thought,"
3465,THE MIDLANDS,"Who, with a simple shippon to their hand,"
3466,THE MIDLANDS,As men upon some godlike business wrought;

3468,THE MIDLANDS,Their beauty still where since Plantagenet
3469,THE MIDLANDS,"Have come the shepherds happily to sleep,"
3470,THE MIDLANDS,Finding the loaves and cups of cider set;
3471,THE MIDLANDS,"I see the twisted shepherds, brown and old,"
3472,THE MIDLANDS,Driving at dusk their glimmering sheep to fold.

3474,THE MIDLANDS,And now the valleys that upon the sun
3475,THE MIDLANDS,"Broke from their opal veils, are veiled again,"
3476,THE MIDLANDS,"And the last light upon the wolds is done,"
3477,THE MIDLANDS,And silence falls on flock and fields and men;
3478,THE MIDLANDS,"And black upon the night I watch my hill,"
3479,THE MIDLANDS,"And the stars shine, and there an owly wing"
3480,THE MIDLANDS,"Brushes the night, and all again is still,"
3481,THE MIDLANDS,"And, from this land of worship that I sing,"

4083,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","After such night of ravage and of rain,"
4084,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",You shall not come again.
4085,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","You shall not come to taste the old spring weather,"
4086,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","To gallop through the soft untrampled heather,"
4087,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",To bathe and bake your body on the grass.
4088,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","We shall be there, alas!"
4089,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","But not with you. When Spring shall wake the earth,"
4090,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","And quicken the scarred fields to the new birth,"
4091,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Our grief shall grow. For what can Spring renew
4092,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",More fiercely for us than the need of you?
4093,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",
4094,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",That night I dreamt they sent for me and said
4095,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","That you were missing, 'missing, missing--dead':"
4096,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","I cried when in the morning I awoke,"
4097,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",And all the world seemed shrouded in a cloak;
4098,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","But when I saw the sun,"
4099,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","And knew another day had just begun,"
4100,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","I brushed the dream away, and quite forgot"
4101,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",The nightmare's ugly blot.
4102,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",So was the dream forgot. The dream came true.
4103,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Before the night I knew
4104,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",That you had flown away into the air
4105,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",For ever. Then I cheated my despair.
4106,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",I said
4107,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",That you were safe--or wounded--but not dead.
4108,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Alas! I knew
4109,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Which was the false and true.
4110,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",
4111,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","And after days of watching, days of lead,"
4112,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",There came the certain news that you were dead.
4113,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","You had died fighting, fighting against odds,"
4114,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Such as in war the gods
4115,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Æthereal dared when all the world was young;
4116,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Such fighting as blind Homer never sung,"
4117,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Nor Hector nor Achilles never knew,"
4118,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",High in the empty blue.
4119,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","High, high, above the clouds, against the setting sun,"
4120,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","The fight was fought, and your great task was done."
4121,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",
4122,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Of all your brave adventures this the last
4123,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",The bravest was and best;
4124,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Meet ending to a long embattled past,"
4125,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","This swift, triumphant, fatal quest,"
4126,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Crowned with the wreath that never perisheth,"
4127,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",And diadem of honourable death;
4128,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Swift Death aflame with offering supreme
4129,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","And mighty sacrifice,"
4130,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",More than all mortal dream;
4131,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","A soaring death, and near to Heaven's gate;"
4132,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Beneath the very walls of Paradise.
4133,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Surely with soul elate,"
4134,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","You heard the destined bullet as you flew,"
4135,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",And surely your prophetic spirit knew
4136,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",That you had well deserved that shining fate.
4137,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",
4138,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Here is no waste,"
4139,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","No burning Might-have-been,"
4140,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","No bitter after-taste,"
4141,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","None to censure, none to screen,"
4142,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Nothing awry, nor anything misspent;"
4143,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Only content, content beyond content,"
4144,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Which hath not any room for betterment.
4145,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",
4146,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","God, Who had made you valiant, strong and swift,"
4147,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","And maimed you with a bullet long ago,"
4148,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","And cleft your riotous ardour with a rift,"
4149,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","And checked your youth's tumultuous overflow,"
4150,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Gave back your youth to you,"
4151,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",And packed in moments rare and few
4152,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Achievements manifold
4153,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","And happiness untold,"
4154,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","And bade you spring to Death as to a bride,"
4155,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","In manhood's ripeness, power and pride,"
4156,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",And on your sandals the strong wings of youth.
4157,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",He let you leave a name
4158,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","To shine on the entablatures of truth,"
4159,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",For ever:
4160,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",To sound for ever in answering halls of fame.
4161,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",
4162,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",For you soared onwards to that world which rags
4163,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Of clouds, like tattered flags,"
4164,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Concealed; you reached the walls of chrysolite,"
4165,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",The mansions white;
4166,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","And losing all, you gained the civic crown"
4167,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Of that eternal town,"
4168,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Wherein you passed a rightful citizen
4169,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Of the bright commonwealth ablaze beyond our ken.
4170,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",
4171,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Surely you found companions meet for you
4172,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",In that high place;
4173,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",You met there face to face
4174,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Those you had never known, but whom you knew:"
4175,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Knights of the Table Round,"
4176,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","And all the very brave, the very true,"
4177,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",With chivalry crowned;
4178,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","The captains rare,"
4179,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Courteous and brave beyond our human air;
4180,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Those who had loved and suffered overmuch,"
4181,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Now free from the world's touch.
4182,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","And with them were the friends of yesterday,"
4183,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Who went before and pointed you the way;
4184,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","And in that place of freshness, light and rest,"
4185,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Where Lancelot and Tristram vigil keep
4186,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Over their King's long sleep,"
4187,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Surely they made a place for you.
4188,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Their long-expected guest,"
4189,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Among the chosen few,"
4190,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","And welcomed you, their brother and their friend,"
4191,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",To that companionship which hath no end.
4192,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",
4193,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",And in the portals of the sacred hall
4194,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","You hear the trumpet's call,"
4195,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","At dawn upon the silvery battlement,"
4196,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Re-echo through the deep
4197,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","And bid the sons of God to rise from sleep,"
4198,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",And with a shout to hail
4199,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",The sunrise on the city of the Grail:
4200,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",The music that proud Lucifer in Hell
4201,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",Missed more than all the joys that he forwent.
4202,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",You hear the solemn bell
4203,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","At vespers, when the oriflammes are furled;"
4204,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","And then you know that somewhere in the world,"
4205,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","That shines far-off beneath you like a gem,"
4206,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","They think of you, and when you think of them"
4207,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","You know that they will wipe away their tears,"
4208,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",And cast aside their fears;
4209,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","That they will have it so,"
4210,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.",And in no otherwise;
4211,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","That it is well with them because they know,"
4212,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","With faithful eyes,"
4213,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Fixed forward and turned upwards to the skies,"
4214,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","That it is well with you,"
4215,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Among the chosen few,"
4216,"IN MEMORIAM, A. H.","Among the very brave, the very true."
