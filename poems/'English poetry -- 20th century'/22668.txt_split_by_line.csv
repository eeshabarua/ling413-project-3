43,PREFATORY NOTE,"This book has been compiled in order that boys and girls, already"
44,PREFATORY NOTE,"perhaps familiar with the great classics of the English speech, may"
45,PREFATORY NOTE,also know something of the newer poetry of their own day.  Most of the
46,PREFATORY NOTE,"writers are living, and the rest are still vivid memories among us,"
47,PREFATORY NOTE,"while one of the youngest, almost as these words are written, has gone"
48,PREFATORY NOTE,singing to lay down his life for his country's cause.  Although no
49,PREFATORY NOTE,"definite chronological limit has been set, and Meredith at least began"
50,PREFATORY NOTE,"to write in the middle of the nineteenth century, the intention has"
51,PREFATORY NOTE,been to represent mainly those poetic tendencies which have become
52,PREFATORY NOTE,dominant as the influence of the accepted Victorian masters has grown
53,PREFATORY NOTE,"weaker, and from which the poetry of the future, however it may"
54,PREFATORY NOTE,"develope, must in turn take its start.  It may be helpful briefly to"
55,PREFATORY NOTE,indicate the sequence of themes.  Man draws his being from the heroic
56,PREFATORY NOTE,Past and from the Earth his Mother; and in harmony with these he must
57,PREFATORY NOTE,shape his life to what high purposes he may.  Therefore this gathering
58,PREFATORY NOTE,of poems falls into three groups.  {viii} First there are poems of
59,PREFATORY NOTE,"History, of the romantic tale of the world, of our own special"
60,PREFATORY NOTE,"tradition here in England, and of the inheritance of obligation which"
61,PREFATORY NOTE,"that tradition imposes upon us.  Naturally, there are some poems"
62,PREFATORY NOTE,"directly inspired by the present war, but nothing, it is hoped, which"
63,PREFATORY NOTE,"may not, in happier days, bear translation into any European tongue."
64,PREFATORY NOTE,"Then there come poems of the Earth, of England again and the longing of"
65,PREFATORY NOTE,"the exile for home, of this and that familiar countryside, of woodland"
66,PREFATORY NOTE,"and meadow and garden, of the process of the seasons, of the ""open"
67,PREFATORY NOTE,"road"" and the ""wind on the heath,"" of the city, its deprivations and"
68,PREFATORY NOTE,"its consolations.  Finally there are poems of Life itself, of the moods"
69,PREFATORY NOTE,"in which it may be faced, of religion, of man's excellent virtues, of"
70,PREFATORY NOTE,"friendship and childhood, of passion, grief, and comfort.  But there is"
71,PREFATORY NOTE,no arbitrary isolation of one theme from another; they mingle and
72,PREFATORY NOTE,"inter-penetrate throughout, to the music of Pan's flute, and of Love's"
73,PREFATORY NOTE,"viol, and the bugle-call of Endeavour, and the passing-bell of Death."

497,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,I laid me down upon the shore
498,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,And dreamed a little space;
499,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,I heard the great waves break and roar;
500,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,The sun was on my face.
501,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,
502,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,My idle hands and fingers brown
503,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,Played with the pebbles grey;
504,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,"The waves came up, the waves went down,"
505,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,Most thundering and gay.
506,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,
507,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,"The pebbles, they were smooth and round"
508,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,"And warm upon my hands,"
509,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,Like little people I had found
510,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,Sitting among the sands.
511,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,
512,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,The grains of sands so shining-small
513,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,Soft through my fingers ran;
514,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,"The sun shone down upon it all,"
515,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,And so my dream began:
516,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,
517,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,How all of this had been before;
518,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,How ages far away
519,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,I lay on some forgotten shore

528,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,
529,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,"I have forgotten whence I came,"
530,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,"Or what my home might be,"

532,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,I called that thundering sea.
533,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,
534,2. PRE-EXISTEHCE,I only know the sun shone down

3575,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3576,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Pitch here the tent, while the old horse grazes!"
3577,72. JUGGLING JERRY,By the old hedge-side we'll halt a stage.
3578,72. JUGGLING JERRY,It's nigh my last above the daisies:
3579,72. JUGGLING JERRY,My next leaf 'll be man's blank page.
3580,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Yes, my old girl! and it's no use crying:"
3581,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Juggler, constable, king, must bow."
3582,72. JUGGLING JERRY,One that outjuggles all 's been spying
3583,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Long to have me, and he has me now."
3584,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3585,72. JUGGLING JERRY,We've travelled times to this old common:
3586,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Often we've hung our pots in the gorse.
3587,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"We've had a stirring life, old woman!"
3588,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"You, and I, and the old grey horse,"
3589,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Races, and fairs, and royal occasions,"
3590,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Found us coming to their call:
3591,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Now they'll miss us at our stations:
3592,72. JUGGLING JERRY,There's a Juggler outjuggles all!
3593,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3594,72. JUGGLING JERRY,{87}
3595,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3596,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Up goes the lark, as if all were jolly!"
3597,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Over the duck-pond the willow shakes.
3598,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Easy to think that grieving's folly,"
3599,72. JUGGLING JERRY,When the hand's firm as driven stakes!
3600,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Ay, when we're strong, and braced, and manful,"
3601,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Life's a sweet fiddle: but we're a batch
3602,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Born to become the Great Juggler's han'ful;
3603,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Balls he shies up, and is safe to catch."
3604,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3605,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Here's where the lads of the village cricket:
3606,72. JUGGLING JERRY,I was a lad not wide from here:
3607,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Couldn't I whip off the bail from the wicket?
3608,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Like an old world those days appear!
3609,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Donkey, sheep, geese, and thatched ale-house--I know them!"
3610,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"They are old friends of my halts, and seem,"
3611,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Somehow, as if kind thanks I owe them:"
3612,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Juggling don't hinder the heart's esteem.
3613,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3614,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Juggling's no sin, for we must have victual:"
3615,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Nature allows us to bait for the fool.
3616,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Holding one's own makes us juggle no little;
3617,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"But, to increase it, hard juggling's the rule."
3618,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"You that are sneering at my profession,"
3619,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Haven't you juggled a vast amount?
3620,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"There's the Prime Minister, in one Session,"
3621,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Juggles more games than my sins'll count.
3622,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3623,72. JUGGLING JERRY,I've murdered insects with mock thunder:
3624,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Conscience, for that, in men don't quail."
3625,72. JUGGLING JERRY,I've made bread from the bump of wonder:
3626,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"That's my business, and there's my tale."
3627,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3628,72. JUGGLING JERRY,{88}
3629,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3630,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Fashion and rank all praised the professor:
3631,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Ay! and I've had my smile from the Queen
3632,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Bravo, Jerry! she meant: God bless her!"
3633,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Ain't this a sermon on that scene?
3634,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3635,72. JUGGLING JERRY,I've studied men from my topsy-turvy
3636,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Close, and, I reckon, rather true."
3637,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Some are fine fellows: some, right scurvy;"
3638,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Most, a dash between the two."
3639,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"But it's a woman, old girl, that makes me"
3640,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Think more kindly of the race,"
3641,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"And it's a woman, old girl, that shakes me"
3642,72. JUGGLING JERRY,When the Great Juggler I must face.
3643,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3644,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"We two were married, due and legal:"
3645,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Honest we've lived since we've been one.
3646,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Lord!  I could then jump like an eagle:
3647,72. JUGGLING JERRY,You danced bright as a bit o' the sun.
3648,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Birds in a May-bush we were! right merry!
3649,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"All night we kiss'd, we juggled all day."
3650,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Joy was the heart of Juggling Jerry!
3651,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Now from his old girl he's juggled away.
3652,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3653,72. JUGGLING JERRY,It's past parsons to console us:
3654,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"No, nor no doctor fetch for me:"
3655,72. JUGGLING JERRY,I can die without my bolus;
3656,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Two of a trade, lass, never agree!"
3657,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Parson and Doctor!--don't they love rarely,"
3658,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Fighting the devil in other men's fields!
3659,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Stand up yourself and match him fairly,"
3660,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Then see how the rascal yields!
3661,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3662,72. JUGGLING JERRY,{89}
3663,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3664,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"I, lass, have lived no gipsy, flaunting"
3665,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Finery while his poor helpmate grubs:
3666,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Coin I've stored, and you won't be wanting:"
3667,72. JUGGLING JERRY,You shan't beg from the troughs and tubs.
3668,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Nobly you've stuck to me, though in his kitchen"
3669,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Many a Marquis would hail you Cook!
3670,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Palaces you could have ruled and grown rich in,"
3671,72. JUGGLING JERRY,But your old Jerry you never forsook.
3672,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3673,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Hand up the chirper! ripe ale winks in it;
3674,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Let's have comfort and be at peace.
3675,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Once a stout draught made me light as a linnet.
3676,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Cheer up! the Lord must have his lease.
3677,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Maybe--for none see in that black hollow--
3678,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"It's just a place where we're held in pawn,"
3679,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"And, when the Great Juggler makes as to swallow,"
3680,72. JUGGLING JERRY,It's just the sword-trick--I ain't quite gone!
3681,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3682,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Yonder came smells of the gorse, so nutty,"
3683,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Gold-like and warm: it's the prime of May
3684,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Better than mortar, brick and putty,"
3685,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Is God's house on a blowing day.
3686,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Lean me more up the mound; now I feel it:
3687,72. JUGGLING JERRY,All the old heath-smells!  Ain't it strange?
3688,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"There's the world laughing, as if to conceal it,"
3689,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"But He's by us, juggling the change."
3690,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3691,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"I mind it well, by the sea-beach lying,"
3692,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Once--it's long gone--when two gulls we beheld,"
3693,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Which, as the moon got up, were flying"
3694,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Down a big wave that sparked and swelled.
3695,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3696,72. JUGGLING JERRY,{90}
3697,72. JUGGLING JERRY,
3698,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Crack went a gun: one fell: the second
3699,72. JUGGLING JERRY,"Wheeled round him, twice, and was off for new luck;"
3700,72. JUGGLING JERRY,There in the dark her white wing beckon'd:--
3701,72. JUGGLING JERRY,Drop me a kiss--I'm the bird dead-struck!

3797,76. LONDON SNOW,"Then boys I heard, as they went to school, calling,"
