46,PREFATORY NOTE,This volume is issued in the belief that English poetry is now once
47,PREFATORY NOTE,again putting on a new strength and beauty.
48,PREFATORY NOTE,
49,PREFATORY NOTE,Few readers have the leisure or the zeal to investigate each volume as
50,PREFATORY NOTE,it appears; and the process of recognition is often slow. This
51,PREFATORY NOTE,"collection, drawn entirely from the publications of the past two years,"
52,PREFATORY NOTE,may if it is fortunate help the lovers of poetry to realize that we are
53,PREFATORY NOTE,"at the beginning of another ""Georgian period"" which may take rank in due"
54,PREFATORY NOTE,time with the several great poetic ages of the past.
55,PREFATORY NOTE,
56,PREFATORY NOTE,It has no pretension to cover the field. Every reader will notice the
57,PREFATORY NOTE,absence of poets whose work would be a necessary ornament of any
58,PREFATORY NOTE,anthology not limited by a definite aim. Two years ago some of the
59,PREFATORY NOTE,writers represented had published nothing; and only a very few of the
60,PREFATORY NOTE,"others were known except to the eagerest ""watchers of the skies."" Those"
61,PREFATORY NOTE,few are here because within the chosen period their work seemed to have
62,PREFATORY NOTE,gained some accession of power.
63,PREFATORY NOTE,
64,PREFATORY NOTE,"My grateful thanks are due to the writers who have lent me their poems,"
65,PREFATORY NOTE,"and to the publishers (Messrs Elkin Mathews, Sidgwick and Jackson,"
66,PREFATORY NOTE,"Methuen, Fifield, Constable, Nutt, Dent, Duckworth, Longmans, and"
67,PREFATORY NOTE,"Maunsel, and the Editors of 'Basileon', 'Rhythm', and the 'English"
68,PREFATORY NOTE,Review') under whose imprint they have appeared.

80,E.M.,make a piece of work that may stop a child from crying or lead nations
81,E.M.,to higher things. For what is it to be a poet? It is to see at a
82,E.M.,"glance the glory of the world, to see beauty in all its forms and"
83,E.M.,"manifestations, to feel ugliness like a pain, to resent the wrongs of"
84,E.M.,"others as bitterly as one's own, to know mankind as others know single"
85,E.M.,"men, to know Nature as botanists know a flower, to be thought a fool,"
86,E.M.,"to hear at moments the clear voice of God."""

185,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,[A quay with vessels moored]
186,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
187,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
188,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
189,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
190,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"To India! Yea, here I may take ship;"
191,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"From here the courses go over the seas,"
192,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Along which the intent prows wonderfully
193,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Nose like lean hounds, and track their journeys out,"
194,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Making for harbours as some sleuth was laid
195,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,For them to follow on their shifting road.
196,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Again I front my appointed ministry.--
197,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,But why the Indian lot to me? Why mine
198,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Such fearful gospelling? For the Lord knew
199,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"What a frail soul He gave me, and a heart"
200,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Lame and unlikely for the large events.--
201,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And this is worse than Baghdad! though that was
202,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"A fearful brink of travel. But if the lots,"
203,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"That gave to me the Indian duty, were"
204,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Shuffled by the unseen skill of Heaven, surely"
205,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,That fear of mine in Baghdad was the same
206,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Marvellous Hand working again, to guard"
207,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,The landward gate of India from me. There
208,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"I stood, waiting in the weak early dawn"
209,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,To start my journey; the great caravan's
210,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Strange cattle with their snoring breaths made steam
211,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Upon the air, and (as I thought) sadly"
212,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,The beasts at market-booths and awnings gay
213,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Of shops, the city's comfortable trade,"
214,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Lookt, and then into months of plodding lookt."
215,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And swiftly on my brain there came a wind
216,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Of vision; and I saw the road mapt out
217,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Along the desert with a chalk of bones;
218,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,I saw a famine and the Afghan greed
219,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Waiting for us, spears at our throats, all we"
220,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Made women by our hunger; and I saw
221,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Gigantic thirst grieving our mouths with dust,"
222,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Scattering up against our breathing salt
223,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Of blown dried dung, till the taste eat like fires"
224,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Of a wild vinegar into our sheathed marrows;
225,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And a sudden decay thicken'd all our bloods
226,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,As rotten leaves in fall will baulk a stream;
227,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Then my kill'd life the muncht food of jackals.--
228,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"The wind of vision died in my brain; and lo,"
229,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,The jangling of the caravan's long gait
230,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Was small as the luting of a breeze in grass
231,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Upon my ears. Into the waiting thirst
232,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Camels and merchants all were gone, while I"
233,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Had been in my amazement. Was this not
234,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"A sign? God with a vision tript me, lest"
235,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Those tall fiends that ken for my approach
236,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"In middle Asia, Thirst and his grisly band"
237,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Of plagues, should with their brigand fingers stop"
238,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"His message in my mouth. Therefore I said,"
239,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"If India is the place where I must preach,"
240,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"I am to go by ship, not overland."
241,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"And here my ship is berthed. But worse, far worse"
242,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Than Baghdad, is this roadstead, the brown sails,"
243,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"All the enginery of going on sea,"
244,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"The tackle and the rigging, tholes and sweeps,"
245,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"The prows built to put by the waves, the masts"
246,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Stayed for a hurricane; and lo, that line"
247,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Of gilded water there! the sun has drawn
248,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,In a long narrow band of shining oil
249,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,His light over the sea; how evilly move
250,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Ripples along that golden skin!--the gleam
251,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Works like a muscular thing! like the half-gorged
252,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Sleepy swallowing of a serpent's neck.
253,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"The sea lives, surely! My eyes swear to it;"
254,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"And, like a murderous smile that glimpses through"
255,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"A villain's courtesy, that twitching dazzle"
256,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Parts the kind mood of weather to bewray
257,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"The feasted waters of the sea, stretched out"
258,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"In lazy gluttony, expecting prey."
259,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,How fearful is this trade of sailing! Worse
260,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Than all land-evils is the water-way
261,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Before me now.--What, cowardice? Nay, why"
262,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Trouble myself with ugly words? 'Tis prudence,"
263,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And prudence is an admirable thing.
264,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Yet here's much cost--these packages piled up,"
265,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Ivory doubtless, emeralds, gums, and silks,"
266,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"All these they trust on shipboard? Ah, but I,"
267,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"I who have seen God, I to put myself"
268,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Amid the heathen outrage of the sea
269,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,In a deal-wood box! It were plain folly.
270,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,There is naught more precious in the world than I:
271,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"I carry God in me, to give to men."
272,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And when has the sea been friendly unto man?
273,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Let it but guess my errand, it will call"
274,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"The dangers of the air to wreak upon me,"
275,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Winds to juggle the puny boat and pinch
276,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,The water into unbelievable creases.
277,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"And shall my soul, and God in my soul, drown?"
278,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Or venture drowning?--But no, no; I am safe."
279,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Smooth as believing souls over their deaths
280,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And over agonies shall slide henceforth
281,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"To God, so shall my way be blest amid"
282,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"The quiet crouching terrors of the sea,"
283,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Like panthers when a fire weakens their hearts;
284,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Ay, this huge sin of nature, the salt sea,"
285,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Shall be afraid of me, and of the mind"
286,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Within me, that with gesture, speech and eyes"
287,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Of the Messiah flames. What element
288,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Dare snarl against my going, what incubus dare"
289,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Remember to be fiendish, when I light"
290,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,My whole being with memory of Him?
291,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"The malice of the sea will slink from me,"
292,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And the air be harmless as a muzzled wolf;
293,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"For I am a torch, and the flame of me is God."
294,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
295,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
296,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,A Ship's Captain:
297,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
298,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"You are my man, my passenger?"
299,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
300,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
301,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
302,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,I am.
303,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,I go to India with you.
304,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
305,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
306,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
307,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Well, I hope so."
308,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,There's threatening in the weather. Have you a mind
309,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"To hug your belly to the slanted deck,"
310,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Like a louse on a whip-top, when the boat"
311,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Spins on an axle in the hissing gales?
312,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
313,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
314,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
315,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
316,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Fear not. 'Tis likely indeed that storms are now
317,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Plotting against our voyage; ay, no doubt"
318,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,The very bottom of the sea prepares
319,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,To stand up mountainous or reach a limb
320,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Out of his night of water and huge shingles,"
321,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,That he and the waves may break our keel. Fear not;
322,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Like those who manage horses, I've a word"
323,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Will fasten up within their evil natures
324,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,The meanings of the winds and waves and reefs.
325,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
326,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
327,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
328,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
329,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,You have a talisman? I have one too;
330,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,I know not if the storms think much of it.
331,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,I may be shark's meat yet. And would your spell
332,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Be daunting to a cuttle, think you now?"
333,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,We had a bout with one on our way here;
334,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"It had green lidless eyes like lanterns, arms"
335,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"As many as the branches of a tree,"
336,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"But limber, and each one of them wise as a snake."
337,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"It laid hold of our bulwarks, and with three"
338,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Long knowing arms, slimy, and of a flesh"
339,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"So tough they'ld fool a hatchet, searcht the ship,"
340,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And stole out of the midst of us all a man;
341,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Yes, and he the proudest man upon the seas"
342,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,For the rare powerful talisman he'd got.
343,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And would yours have done better?
344,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
345,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
346,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
347,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,I am one
348,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Not easily frightened. I'm for India.
349,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,You will not put me from my way with talk.
350,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
351,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
352,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
353,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
354,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"My heart, I never thought of frightening you.--"
355,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Well, here's both tide and wind, and we may not start."
356,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
357,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
358,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
359,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
360,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Not start? I pray you, do."
361,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
362,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
363,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
364,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,It's no use praying;
365,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,I dare not. I've not half my cargo yet.
366,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
367,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
368,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
369,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
370,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"What do you wait for, then?"
371,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
372,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
373,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:             A carpenter.
374,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
375,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
376,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
377,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
378,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,You are talking strangely.
379,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
380,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
381,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
382,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,But not idly.
383,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,I might as well broach all my blood at once
384,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Here as I stand, as sail to India back"
385,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Without a carpenter on board;--O strangely
386,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Wise are our kings in the killing of men!
387,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
388,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
389,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
390,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
391,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,But does your king then need a carpenter?
392,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
393,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
394,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
395,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
396,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Yes, for he dreamed a dream; and like a man"
397,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Who, having eaten poison, and with all"
398,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Force of his life turned out the crazing drug,"
399,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Has only a weak and wrestled nature left
400,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,That gives in foolishly to some bad desire
401,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,A healthy man would laugh at; so our king
402,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Is left desiring by his venomous dream.
403,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"But, being a king, the whole land aches with him."
404,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
405,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
406,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
407,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,What dream was that?
408,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
409,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
410,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
411,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,A palace made of souls;--
412,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Ay, there's a folly for a man to dream!"
413,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"He saw a palace covering all the land,"
414,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Big as the day itself, made of a stone"
415,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,That answered with a better gleam than glass
416,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"To the sun's greeting, fashioned like the sound"
417,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Of laughter copied into shining shape:
418,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,So the king said. And with him in the dream
419,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,There was a voice that fleered upon the king:
420,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,'This is the man who makes much of himself
421,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,For filling the common eyes with palaces
422,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Gorgeously bragging out his royalty:
423,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Whereas he hath not one that seemeth not
424,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"In work, in height, in posture on the ground,"
425,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"A hut, a peasant's dingy shed, to mine."
426,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"And all his excellent woods, metals, and stones,"
427,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,The things he's filched out of the earth's old pockets
428,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"And hoised up into walls and domes; the gold,"
429,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Ebony, agate stairs, wainscots of jade,"
430,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"The windows of jargoon, and heavenly lofts"
431,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Of marble, all the stuff he takes to be wealth,"
432,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Reckons like savage mud and wattle against
433,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"The matter of my building.'--And the king,"
434,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Gloating upon the white sheen of that palace,"
435,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"And weeping like a girl ashamed, inquired"
436,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"'What is that stone?' And the voice answered him,"
437,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"'Soul.' 'But in my palaces too,' said he,"
438,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"'There should be soul built: I have driven nations,"
439,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"What with quarrying, what with craning, down"
440,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"To death, and sure their souls stay in my work.'"
441,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And 'Mud and wattle' sneered the voice again;
442,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"But added, 'In the west there is a man,"
443,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"A slave, a carpenter, whose heart has been"
444,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Apprenticed to the skill that built my reign,"
445,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"This beauty; and were he master of your gangs,"
446,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,He'ld build you a palace that would look like mine.'--
447,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"So now no ship may sail from India,"
448,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Since the king's scornful dream, unless it bring"
449,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,A carpenter among its homeward lading:
450,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And carpenters are getting hard to find.
451,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
452,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
453,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
454,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
455,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And have none made for the king his desire?
456,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
457,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
458,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
459,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
460,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Many have tried, with roasting living men"
461,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"In queer huge kilns, and other sleights, to found"
462,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,A glass of human souls; and others seek
463,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,With marvellous stone to please our desperate king.
464,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Always at last their own tormented bodies
465,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Delight the cruelty of the king's heart.
466,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
467,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
468,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
469,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
470,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Well then, I hope you'll find your carpenter,"
471,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And soon. I would not that we wait too long;
472,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,I loathe a dallying journey.--I should suppose
473,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"We'ld have good sailing at this season, now?"
474,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
475,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
476,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
477,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
478,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Why, you were looking, a few minutes gone,"
479,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,For rare wild storms: I hope we'll have them too;
480,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,I want to see you work that talisman
481,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,You boast about: I've a great love for spells.
482,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
483,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
484,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
485,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
486,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Let it be storm or calm, so we be sailing."
487,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"I long have wished to voyage into mid sea,"
488,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,To give my senses rest from wondering
489,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,On this perplexed grammar of the land
490,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Written in men and women, the strange trees,"
491,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Herbs, and those things so like to souls, the beasts."
492,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,My wilful senses will keep perilously
493,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Employed with these my brain, and weary it"
494,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Still to be asking. But on the high seas
495,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Such throng'd reality is left behind,--"
496,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Only vast air and water, and the hue"
497,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,That always seems like special news of God.
498,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Surely 'tis half way to eternity
499,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,To go where only size and colour live;
500,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And I could purify my mind from all
501,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Worldly amazement by imagining
502,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Beyond my senses into God's great Heaven,"
503,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,If I were in mid sea. I have dreamed of this.
504,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Wondrous too, I think, to sail at night,"
505,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"While shoals of moonlight flickers dance beside,"
506,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Like swimming glee of fishes scaled in gold,"
507,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Curvetting in thwart bounds over the swell;
508,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"The perceiving flesh, in bliss of such a beauty,"
509,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Must sure feel fine as spiritual sight.--
510,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Moods have been on me, too, when I would be"
511,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Sailing recklessly through wild darkness, where"
512,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Gigantic whispers of a harassed sea
513,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Fill the whole world of air, and I stand up"
514,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"To breast the danger of the loosen'd sky,"
515,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"And feel my immortality like music,--"
516,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Yea, I alone in the broken world, firm things"
517,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"All gone to monstrous flurry, knowing myself"
518,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,An indestructible word spoken by God.--
519,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"This is a small, small boat?"
520,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
521,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
522,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
523,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Small is nothing,"
524,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"A bucket will do, so it know how to ride"
525,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Top upward: cleverness is the thing in boats.
526,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And I wish this were cleverer: she goes crank
527,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,At times just when she should go sober.
528,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,But what? Boats are but girls for whimsies: men
529,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Must let them have their freaks.
530,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
531,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
532,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
533,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Have you good skill
534,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,In seamanship?
535,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
536,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
537,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
538,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Well, I am not drowned yet,"
539,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Though I'm a grey man and have been at sea
540,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Longer than you've been walking. My old sight
541,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Can tell Mizar from Alcor still.
542,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
543,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
544,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Ay, so;"
545,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Doubtless you'll bring me safe to India.
546,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,But being there--tell me now of the land:
547,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,How use they strangers there?
548,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
549,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
550,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
551,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Queerly, sometimes."
552,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"If the king's moody, and tired of feeling nerves"
553,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Mildly made happy with soft jewel of silk,"
554,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Odours and wines and slim lascivious girls,"
555,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"And yearns for sharper thrills to pierce his brain,"
556,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,He often finds a stranger handy then.
557,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
558,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
559,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
560,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Why, what do you mean?"
561,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
562,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
563,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
564,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,There was a merchant came
565,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"To Travancore, and could not speak our talk;"
566,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"And, it chanced, he was brought before the throne"
567,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Just when the king was weary of sweet pleasures.
568,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"So, to better his tongue, a rope was bent"
569,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Beneath his oxters, up he was hauled, and fire"
570,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Let singe the soles of his feet, until his legs"
571,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Wriggled like frying eels; then the king's dogs
572,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Were set to hunt the hirpling man. The king
573,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Laught greatly and cried, 'But give the dogs words they know,"
574,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And they'll be tame.'--Have you the Indian speech?
575,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
576,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
577,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
578,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Not yet: it will be given me, I trust."
579,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
580,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
581,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
582,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"You'd best make sure of the gift. Another stranger,"
583,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Who swore he knew of better gods than ours,"
584,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Seemed to the king troubled with fleas, and slaves"
585,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Were told to groom him smartly, which they did"
586,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Thoroughly with steel combs, until at last"
587,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,They curried the living flesh from off his bones
588,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"And stript his face of gristle, till he was"
589,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Skull and half skeleton and yet alive.
590,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,You're not for dealing in new gods?
591,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
592,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
593,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
594,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Not I.
595,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Was the man killed?
596,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
597,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
598,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
599,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,He lived a little while;
600,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,But the flies killed him.
601,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
602,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
603,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
604,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Flies? I hope India
605,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Is not a fly-plagued land? I abhor flies.
606,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
607,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
608,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
609,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"You will see strange ones, for our Indian life"
610,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Hath wonderful fierce breeding. Common earth
611,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,With us quickens to buzzing flights of wings
612,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,As readily as a week-old carcase here
613,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Thrown in a sunny marsh. Why, we have wasps"
614,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,That make your hornets seem like pretty midges;
615,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And there be flies in India will drink
616,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Not only blood of bulls, tigers, and bears,"
617,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"But pierce the river-horses' creasy leather,"
618,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Ay, worry crocodiles through their cuirasses"
619,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And prick the metal fishes when they bask.
620,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"You'll feel them soon, with beaks like sturdy pins,"
621,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Treating their stinging thirsts with your best blood.
622,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,A man can't walk a mile in India
623,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Without being the business of a throng'd
624,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And moving town of flies; they hawk at a man
625,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"As bold as little eagles, and as wild."
626,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"And, I suppose, only a fool will blame them."
627,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Flies have the right to sink wells in our skin
628,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,All as men to bore parcht earth for water.
629,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"But I must do a job on board, and then"
630,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Search the town afresh for a carpenter.
631,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
632,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
633,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas: (alone)
634,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Ay, loose tongue, I know how thou art prompted."
635,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Satan's cunning device thou art, to sap"
636,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,My heart with chatter'd fears. How easy it is
637,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,For a stiff mind to hold itself upright
638,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Against the cords of devilish suggestion
639,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Tackled about it, though kept downward strained"
640,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"With sly, masterful winches made of fear."
641,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Yea, when the mind is warned what engines mean"
642,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"To ply it into grovelling, and thought set firm,"
643,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,The tugging strings fail like a cobweb-stuff.
644,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Not as in Baghdad is it with me now;
645,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Nor canst thou, Satan, by a prating mouth"
646,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Fell my tall purpose to a flatlong scorn.
647,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,I can divide the check of God's own hand
648,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,From tempting such as this: India is mine!--
649,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Ay, fiend, and if thou utter thy storming heart"
650,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Into the ocean sea, as into mob"
651,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"A rebel utters turbulence and rage,"
652,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And raise before my path swelling barriers
653,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Of hatred soul'd in water, yet will I strike"
654,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"My purpose, and God's purpose, clean through all"
655,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,The ridges of thy power. And I will show
656,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"This mask that the devil wears, this old shipman,"
657,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,A thing to make his proud heart of evil
658,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Writhe like a trodden snake; yea, he shall see"
659,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,How godly faith can go upon the huge
660,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Fury of forces bursting out of law,"
661,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Easily as a boy goes on windy grass.--
662,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,O marvel! that my little life of mind
663,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Can by mere thinking the unsizeable
664,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Creature of sea enslave! I must believe it.
665,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,The mind hath many powers beyond name
666,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Deep womb'd within it, and can shoot strange vigours:"
667,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Men there have been who could so grimly look
668,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,That soldiers' hearts went out like candle flames
669,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Before their eyes, and the blood perisht in them.--"
670,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,But I--could I do that? Would I not feel
671,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,The power in me if 'twas there? And yet
672,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"'Twere a child's game to what I have to do,"
673,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,For days and days with sleepless faith oppress
674,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And terrorise the demon sea. I think
675,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"A man might, as I saw my Master once,"
676,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Pass unharmed through a storm of men, yet fail"
677,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"At this that lies before me: men are mind,"
678,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And mind can conquer mind; but how can it quell
679,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,The unappointed purpose of great waters?--
680,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Well, say the sea is past: why, then I have"
681,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"My feet but on the threshold of my task,"
682,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"To gospel India,--my single heart"
683,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,To seize into the order of its beat
684,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"All the strange blood of India, my brain"
685,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,To lord the dark thought of that tann'd mankind!--
686,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"O horrible those sweltry places are,"
687,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Where the sun comes so close, it makes the earth"
688,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Burn in a frenzy of breeding,--smoke and flame"
689,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Of lives burning up from agoniz'd loam!
690,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Those monstrous sappy jungles of clutcht growth,"
691,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Enormous weed hugging enormous weed,"
692,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,What can such fearful increase have to do
693,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"With prospering bounty? A rage works in the ground,"
694,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Incurably, like frantic lechery,"
695,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Pouring its passion out in crops and spawns.
696,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"'Tis as the mighty spirit of life, that here"
697,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Walketh beautifully praising, glad of God,"
698,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Should, stepping on the poison'd Indian shore,"
699,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Breathing the Indian air of fire and steams,"
700,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Fling herself into a craze of hideous dancing,"
701,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"The green gown whipping her swift limbs, all her body"
702,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Writhen to speak inutterable desire,"
703,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Tormented by a glee of hating God.
704,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Nay, it must be, to visit India,"
705,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"That frantic pomp and hurrying forth of life,"
706,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,As if a man should enter at unawares
707,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"The dreaming mind of Satan, gorgeously"
708,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Imagining his eternal hell of lust.--
709,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
710,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"They say the land is full of apes, which have"
711,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Their own gods and worship; how ghastly, this!--"
712,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"That demons (for it must be so) should build,"
713,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"In mockery of man's upward faith, the souls"
714,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Of monkeys, those lewd mammets of mankind,"
715,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Into a dreadful farce of adoration!
716,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And flies! a land of flies! where the hot soil
717,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Foul with ceaseless decay steams into flies!
718,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,So thick they pile themselves in the air above
719,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Their meal of filth, they seem like breathing heaps"
720,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Of formless life mounded upon the earth;
721,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And buzzing always like the pipes and strings
722,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Of solemn music made for sorcerers.--
723,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"I abhor flies,--to see them stare upon me"
724,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Out of their little faces of gibbous eyes;
725,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,To feel the dry cool skin of their bodies alight
726,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Perching upon my lips!--O yea, a dream,"
727,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"A dream of impious obscene Satan, this"
728,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Monstrous frenzy of life, the Indian being!"
729,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,And there are men in the dream! What men are they?
730,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"I've heard, naught relishes their brains so much"
731,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,As to tie down a man and tease his flesh
732,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Infamously, until a hundred pains"
733,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Hound the desiring life out of his body,"
734,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Filling his nerves with such a fearful zest
735,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,That the soul overstrained shatters beneath it.
736,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Must I preach God to these murderous hearts?
737,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,I would my lot had fallen to go and dare
738,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Death from the silent dealing of Northern cold!--
739,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
740,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"O, but I would face all these Indian fears,"
741,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"The horror of the huge power of life,"
742,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"The beasts all fierce and venomous, the men"
743,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"With cruel souls, learned to invent pain,"
744,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"All these and more, if I had any hope"
745,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"That, braving them, Lord Christ prosper'd through me."
746,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"If Christ desired India, He had sent"
747,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"The band of us, solder'd in one great purpose,"
748,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,To strike His message through those dark vast tribes
749,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"But one man!--O surely it is folly,"
750,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"And we misread the lot! One man, to thrust,"
751,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Even though in his soul the lamp was kindled
752,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"At God's own hands, one man's lit soul to thrust"
753,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,The immense Indian darkness out of the world!
754,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,For human flesh there breeds as furiously
755,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"As the green things and the cattle; and it is all,"
756,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"All this enormity of measureless folk,"
757,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Penn'd in a land so close to the devil's reign
758,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"The very apes have faith in him.--No, no;"
759,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Impetuous brains mistake the signs of God
760,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Too easily. God would not have me waste
761,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"My zeal for Him in this wild enterprise,"
762,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Of going alone to swarming India;--one man,"
763,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"One mortal voice, to charm those myriad ears"
764,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Away from the fiendish clamour of Indian gods,"
765,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,One man preaching the truth against the huge
766,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Bray of the gongs and horns of the Indian priests!
767,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,A cup of wine poured in the sea were not
768,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"More surely lost in the green and brackish depths,"
769,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Than the fire and fragrance of my doctrine poured
770,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Into that multitudinous pond of men,"
771,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,India.--Shipman! Master of the ship!--
772,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,I have thought better of this journey; now
773,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,I find I am not meant to go.
774,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
775,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
776,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:       Not meant?
777,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
778,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
779,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thomas:
780,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"I would say, I had forgotten Indian air"
781,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Is full of fevers; and my health is bad
782,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,For holding out against fever.
783,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
784,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
785,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
786,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,As you please.
787,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"I keep your fare, though."
788,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
789,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
790,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Thomas:           O, 'tis yours.--Good sailing!"
791,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
792,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
793,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"[As he makes to depart, a Noble Stranger is seen approaching along the"
794,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,quay.]
795,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
796,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,
797,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Captain:
798,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Well, here's a marvel: 'Tis a king, for sure!"
799,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,'Twould take the taxes of a world to dress
800,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"A man in that silken gold, and all those gems."
801,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"What a flash the light makes of him; nay, he burns;"
802,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"And he's here on the quay all by himself,"
803,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"Not even a slave to fan him!--Man, you're ailing!"

838,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Stranger:

905,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"And one that groweth deep into a life,"
906,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,With hardening roots that clutch about the breast.
907,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,For this refuses faith in the unknown powers

910,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,To a judgment bought by safe experience;
911,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Narrows desire into the scope of thought.
912,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,"But it is written in the heart of man,"
913,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thou shalt no larger be than thy desire.
914,THE SALE OF SAINT THOMAS,Thou must not therefore stoop thy spirit's sight

950,THE END OF THE WORLD,The snow had fallen many nights and days;
951,THE END OF THE WORLD,"The sky was come upon the earth at last,"
952,THE END OF THE WORLD,Sifting thinly down as endlessly
953,THE END OF THE WORLD,As though within the system of blind planets
954,THE END OF THE WORLD,Something had been forgot or overdriven.
955,THE END OF THE WORLD,The dawn now seemed neglected in the grey
956,THE END OF THE WORLD,Where mountains were unbuilt and shadowless trees
957,THE END OF THE WORLD,Rootlessly paused or hung upon the air.
958,THE END OF THE WORLD,"There was no wind, but now and then a sigh"
959,THE END OF THE WORLD,Crossed that dry falling dust and rifted it
960,THE END OF THE WORLD,Through crevices of slate and door and casement.
961,THE END OF THE WORLD,Perhaps the new moon's time was even past.
962,THE END OF THE WORLD,"Outside, the first white twilights were too void"
963,THE END OF THE WORLD,"Until a sheep called once, as to a lamb,"
964,THE END OF THE WORLD,And tenderness crept everywhere from it;
965,THE END OF THE WORLD,But now the flock must have strayed far away.
966,THE END OF THE WORLD,"The lights across the valley must be veiled,"
967,THE END OF THE WORLD,The smoke lost in the greyness or the dusk.
968,THE END OF THE WORLD,For more than three days now the snow had thatched
969,THE END OF THE WORLD,That cow-house roof where it had ever melted
970,THE END OF THE WORLD,With yellow stains from the beasts' breath inside;
971,THE END OF THE WORLD,"But yet a dog howled there, though not quite lately."
972,THE END OF THE WORLD,Someone passed down the valley swift and singing.
973,THE END OF THE WORLD,"Yes, with locks spreaded like a son of morning;"
974,THE END OF THE WORLD,But if he seemed too tall to be a man
975,THE END OF THE WORLD,"It was that men had been so long unseen,"
976,THE END OF THE WORLD,Or shapes loom larger through a moving snow.
977,THE END OF THE WORLD,And he was gone and food had not been given him.
978,THE END OF THE WORLD,"When snow slid from an overweighted leaf,"
979,THE END OF THE WORLD,"Shaking the tree, it might have been a bird"
980,THE END OF THE WORLD,"Slipping in sleep or shelter, whirring wings;"
981,THE END OF THE WORLD,"Yet never bird fell out, save once a dead one--"
982,THE END OF THE WORLD,And in two days the snow had covered it.
983,THE END OF THE WORLD,The dog had howled again--or thus it seemed
984,THE END OF THE WORLD,Until a lean fox passed and cried no more.
985,THE END OF THE WORLD,All was so safe indoors where life went on
986,THE END OF THE WORLD,Glad of the close enfolding snow--O glad
987,THE END OF THE WORLD,"To be so safe and secret at its heart,"
988,THE END OF THE WORLD,Watching the strangeness of familiar things.
989,THE END OF THE WORLD,"They knew not what dim hours went on, went by,"
990,THE END OF THE WORLD,For while they slept the clock stopt newly wound
991,THE END OF THE WORLD,"As the cold hardened. Once they watched the road,"
992,THE END OF THE WORLD,Thinking to be remembered. Once they doubted
993,THE END OF THE WORLD,"If they had kept the sequence of the days,"
994,THE END OF THE WORLD,Because they heard not any sound of bells.
995,THE END OF THE WORLD,"A butterfly, that hid until the Spring"
996,THE END OF THE WORLD,"Under a ceiling's shadow, dropt, was dead."
997,THE END OF THE WORLD,"The coldness seemed more nigh, the coldness deepened"
998,THE END OF THE WORLD,As a sound deepens into silences;
999,THE END OF THE WORLD,It was of earth and came not by the air;
1000,THE END OF THE WORLD,The earth was cooling and drew down the sky.
1001,THE END OF THE WORLD,The air was crumbling. There was no more sky.
1002,THE END OF THE WORLD,"Rails of a broken bed charred in the grate,"
1003,THE END OF THE WORLD,And when he touched the bars he thought the sting
1004,THE END OF THE WORLD,Came from their heat--he could not feel such cold ...
1005,THE END OF THE WORLD,"She said 'O, do not sleep,"
1006,THE END OF THE WORLD,"Heart, heart of mine, keep near me. No, no; sleep."
1007,THE END OF THE WORLD,"I will not lift his fallen, quiet eyelids,"
1008,THE END OF THE WORLD,Although I know he would awaken then--
1009,THE END OF THE WORLD,He closed them thus but now of his own will.
1010,THE END OF THE WORLD,He can stay with me while I do not lift them.'

1354,THE FISH,Superb on unreturning tides.

1358,THE FISH,"Mysterious, and shape to shape"
1359,THE FISH,"Dies momently through whorl and hollow,"
1360,THE FISH,And form and line and solid follow
1361,THE FISH,Solid and line and form to dream

1372,THE FISH,The hyaline of drifting glooms;
1373,THE FISH,The strange soft-handed depth subdues
1374,THE FISH,"Drowned colour there, but black to hues,"

1399,THE FISH,
1400,THE FISH,"O world of lips, O world of laughter,"
1401,THE FISH,"Where hope is fleet and thought flies after,"
1402,THE FISH,"Of lights in the clear night, of cries"

1414,THE FISH,Darkness is cold and strange and bare;
1415,THE FISH,And the secret deeps are whisperless;
1416,THE FISH,And rhythm is all deliciousness;
1417,THE FISH,"And joy is in the throbbing tide,"
1418,THE FISH,Whose intricate fingers beat and glide
1419,THE FISH,In felt bewildering harmonies
1420,THE FISH,Of trembling touch; and music is

1483,DINING-ROOM TEA,And cup and cloth; and they and we
1484,DINING-ROOM TEA,Flung all the dancing moments by

1486,DINING-ROOM TEA,"Flashed on the glory, shone and cried,"
1487,DINING-ROOM TEA,"Improvident, unmemoried;"

1496,DINING-ROOM TEA,From the dark woven flow of change
1497,DINING-ROOM TEA,Under a vast and starless sky

1509,DINING-ROOM TEA,"But lay, but slept unbroken there,"
1510,DINING-ROOM TEA,"On stiller flesh, and body breathless,"
1511,DINING-ROOM TEA,"And lips and laughter stayed and deathless,"
1512,DINING-ROOM TEA,And words on which no silence grew.
1513,DINING-ROOM TEA,Light was more alive than you.

1515,DINING-ROOM TEA,"For suddenly, and otherwhence,"

1528,DINING-ROOM TEA,Change closed about me like a sleep.
1529,DINING-ROOM TEA,Light glinted on the eyes I loved.

1569,THE SONG OF ELF,"Blue-eyed was Elf the minstrel,"
1570,THE SONG OF ELF,"With womanish hair and ring,"
1571,THE SONG OF ELF,"Yet heavy was his hand on sword,"
1572,THE SONG OF ELF,Though light upon the string.
1573,THE SONG OF ELF,
1574,THE SONG OF ELF,And as he stirred the strings of the harp
1575,THE SONG OF ELF,"To notes but four or five,"
1576,THE SONG OF ELF,The heart of each man moved in him
1577,THE SONG OF ELF,Like a babe buried alive.
1578,THE SONG OF ELF,
1579,THE SONG OF ELF,And they felt the land of the folk-songs
1580,THE SONG OF ELF,"Spread southward of the Dane,"
1581,THE SONG OF ELF,And they heard the good Rhine flowing
1582,THE SONG OF ELF,In the heart of all Allemagne.
1583,THE SONG OF ELF,
1584,THE SONG OF ELF,"They felt the land of the folk-songs,"
1585,THE SONG OF ELF,"Where the gifts hang on the tree,"
1586,THE SONG OF ELF,Where the girls give ale at morning

1588,THE SONG OF ELF,
1589,THE SONG OF ELF,"The mighty people, womanlike,"
1590,THE SONG OF ELF,That have pleasure in their pain;
1591,THE SONG OF ELF,"As he sang of Balder beautiful,"
1592,THE SONG OF ELF,Whom the heavens loved in vain.
1593,THE SONG OF ELF,
1594,THE SONG OF ELF,"As he sang of Balder beautiful,"
1595,THE SONG OF ELF,"Whom the heavens could not save,"
1596,THE SONG OF ELF,Till the world was like a sea of tears
1597,THE SONG OF ELF,And every soul a wave.

1599,THE SONG OF ELF,'There is always a thing forgotten

1601,THE SONG OF ELF,"A thing forgotten, as long ago"
1602,THE SONG OF ELF,"When the gods forgot the mistletoe,"
1603,THE SONG OF ELF,And soundless as an arrow of snow
1604,THE SONG OF ELF,The arrow of anguish fell.
1605,THE SONG OF ELF,
1606,THE SONG OF ELF,"'The thing on the blind side of the heart,"
1607,THE SONG OF ELF,On the wrong side of the door;

1627,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER
1628,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,
1629,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,
1630,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"A dear old couple my grandparents were,"
1631,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,And kind to all dumb things; they saw in Heaven
1632,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,The lamb that Jesus petted when a child;
1633,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Their faith was never draped by Doubt: to them
1634,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Death was a rainbow in Eternity,"
1635,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,That promised everlasting brightness soon.
1636,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,An old seafaring man was he; a rough
1637,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Old man, but kind; and hairy, like the nut"
1638,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Full of sweet milk. All day on shore he watched
1639,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"The winds for sailors' wives, and told what ships"
1640,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Enjoyed fair weather, and what ships had storms;"
1641,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"He watched the sky, and he could tell for sure"
1642,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"What afternoons would follow stormy morns,"
1643,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,If quiet nights would end wild afternoons.
1644,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"He leapt away from scandal with a roar,"
1645,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"And if a whisper still possessed his mind,"
1646,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,He walked about and cursed it for a plague.
1647,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"He took offence at Heaven when beggars passed,"
1648,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,And sternly called them back to give them help.
1649,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"In this old captain's house I lived, and things"
1650,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,That house contained were in ships' cabins once;
1651,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Sea-shells and charts and pebbles, model ships;"
1652,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Green weeds, dried fishes stuffed, and coral stalks;"
1653,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Old wooden trunks with handles of spliced rope,"
1654,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"With copper saucers full of monies strange,"
1655,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"That seemed the savings of dead men, not touched"
1656,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,To keep them warm since their real owners died;
1657,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Strings of red beads, methought were dipped in blood,"
1658,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"And swinging lamps, as though the house might move;"
1659,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"An ivory lighthouse built on ivory rocks,"
1660,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,The bones of fishes and three bottled ships.
1661,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,And many a thing was there which sailors make
1662,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"In idle hours, when on long voyages,"
1663,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Of marvellous patience, to no lovely end."
1664,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,And on those charts I saw the small black dots
1665,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"That were called islands, and I knew they had"
1666,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Turtles and palms, and pirates' buried gold."
1667,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"There came a stranger to my granddad's house,"
1668,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"The old man's nephew, a seafarer too;"
1669,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"A big, strong able man who could have walked"
1670,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Twm Barlum's hill all clad in iron mail;
1671,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,So strong he could have made one man his club
1672,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"To knock down others--Henry was his name,"
1673,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,No other name was uttered by his kin.
1674,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"And here he was, insooth illclad, but oh,"
1675,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Thought I, what secrets of the sea are his!"
1676,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"This man knows coral islands in the sea,"
1677,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,And dusky girls heartbroken for white men;
1678,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"This sailor knows of wondrous lands afar,"
1679,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"More rich than Spain, when the Phoenicians shipped"
1680,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Silver for common ballast, and they saw"
1681,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Horses at silver mangers eating grain;
1682,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,This man has seen the wind blow up a mermaid's hair
1683,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Which, like a golden serpent, reared and stretched"
1684,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,To feel the air away beyond her head.
1685,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"He begged my pennies, which I gave with joy--"
1686,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,He will most certainly return some time
1687,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"A self-made king of some new land, and rich."
1688,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Alas that he, the hero of my dreams,"
1689,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Should be his people's scorn; for they had rose
1690,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"To proud command of ships, whilst he had toiled"
1691,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Before the mast for years, and well content;"
1692,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Him they despised, and only Death could bring"
1693,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,A likeness in his face to show like them.
1694,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"For he drank all his pay, nor went to sea"
1695,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,As long as ale was easy got on shore.
1696,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Now, in his last long voyage he had sailed"
1697,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,From Plymouth Sound to where sweet odours fan
1698,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"The Cingalese at work, and then back home--"
1699,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,But came not near his kin till pay was spent.
1700,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"He was not old, yet seemed so; for his face"
1701,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Looked like the drowned man's in the morgue, when it"
1702,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Has struck the wooden wharves and keels of ships.
1703,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"And all his flesh was pricked with Indian ink,"
1704,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,His body marked as rare and delicate
1705,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"As dead men struck by lightning under trees,"
1706,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,And pictured with fine twigs and curled ferns;
1707,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Chains on his neck and anchors on his arms;
1708,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Rings on his fingers, bracelets on his wrist;"
1709,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,And on his breast the Jane of Appledore
1710,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Was schooner rigged, and in full sail at sea."
1711,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"He could not whisper with his strong hoarse voice,"
1712,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,No more than could a horse creep quietly;
1713,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,He laughed to scorn the men that muffled close
1714,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"For fear of wind, till all their neck was hid,"
1715,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Like Indian corn wrapped up in long green leaves;
1716,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"He knew no flowers but seaweeds brown and green,"
1717,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,He knew no birds but those that followed ships.
1718,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Full well he knew the water-world; he heard
1719,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"A grander music there than we on land,"
1720,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,When organ shakes a church; swore he would make
1721,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"The sea his home, though it was always roused"
1722,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,By such wild storms as never leave Cape Horn;
1723,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Happy to hear the tempest grunt and squeal
1724,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Like pigs heard dying in a slaughterhouse.
1725,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"A true-born mariner, and this his hope--"
1726,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"His coffin would be what his cradle was,"
1727,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,A boat to drown in and be sunk at sea;
1728,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,To drown at sea and lie a dainty corpse
1729,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Salted and iced in Neptune's larder deep.
1730,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"This man despised small coasters, fishing-smacks;"
1731,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,He scorned those sailors who at night and morn
1732,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Can see the coast, when in their little boats"
1733,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,They go a six days' voyage and are back
1734,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Home with their wives for every Sabbath day.
1735,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Much did he talk of tankards of old beer,"
1736,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"And bottled stuff he drank in other lands,"
1737,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Which was a liquid fire like Hell to gulp,"
1738,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,But Paradise to sip.
1739,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,
1740,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,And so he talked;
1741,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Nor did those people listen with more awe
1742,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,To Lazarus--whom they had seen stone dead--
1743,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Than did we urchins to that seaman's voice.
1744,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"He many a tale of wonder told: of where,"
1745,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"At Argostoli, Cephalonia's sea"
1746,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Ran over the earth's lip in heavy floods;
1747,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,And then again of how the strange Chinese
1748,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Conversed much as our homely Blackbirds sing.
1749,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,He told us how he sailed in one old ship
1750,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Near that volcano Martinique, whose power"
1751,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Shook like dry leaves the whole Carribean seas;
1752,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,And made the sun set in a sea of fire
1753,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Which only half was his; and dust was thick
1754,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"On deck, and stones were pelted at the mast."
1755,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"So, as we walked along, that seaman dropped"
1756,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Into my greedy ears such words that sleep
1757,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Stood at my pillow half the night perplexed.
1758,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"He told how isles sprang up and sank again,"
1759,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Between short voyages, to his amaze;"
1760,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"How they did come and go, and cheated charts;"
1761,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Told how a crew was cursed when one man killed
1762,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,A bird that perched upon a moving barque;
1763,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"And how the sea's sharp needles, firm and strong,"
1764,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Ripped open the bellies of big, iron ships;"
1765,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Of mighty icebergs in the Northern seas,"
1766,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"That haunt the far horizon like white ghosts,"
1767,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,He told of waves that lift a ship so high
1768,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,That birds could pass from starboard unto port
1769,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Under her dripping keel.
1770,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,
1771,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Oh, it was sweet"
1772,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,To hear that seaman tell such wondrous tales:
1773,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"How deep the sea in parts, that drowned men"
1774,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Must go a long way to their graves and sink
1775,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Day after day, and wander with the tides."
1776,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,He spake of his own deeds; of how he sailed
1777,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"One summer's night along the Bosphorus,"
1778,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,And he--who knew no music like the wash
1779,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Of waves against a ship, or wind in shrouds--"
1780,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Heard then the music on that woody shore
1781,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Of nightingales, and feared to leave the deck,"
1782,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,He thought 'twas sailing into Paradise.
1783,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,To hear these stories all we urchins placed
1784,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Our pennies in that seaman's ready hand;
1785,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Until one morn he signed for a long cruise,"
1786,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,And sailed away--we never saw him more.
1787,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,Could such a man sink in the sea unknown?
1788,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"Nay, he had found a land with something rich,"
1789,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,That kept his eyes turned inland for his life.
1790,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,"'A damn bad sailor and a landshark too,"
1791,THE CHILD AND THE MARINER,No good in port or out'--my granddad said.

1956,THE SLEEPER,"She felt that she must creep,"
1957,THE SLEEPER,"So silent was the clear cool house,"
1958,THE SLEEPER,It seemed a house of sleep.
1959,THE SLEEPER,"And sure, when she pushed open the door,"
1960,THE SLEEPER,"Rapt in the stillness there,"
1961,THE SLEEPER,"Her mother sat, with stooping head,"
1962,THE SLEEPER,Asleep upon a chair;
1963,THE SLEEPER,Fast--fast asleep; her two hands laid
1964,THE SLEEPER,"Loose-folded on her knee,"
1965,THE SLEEPER,So that her small unconscious face
1966,THE SLEEPER,Looked half unreal to be:
1967,THE SLEEPER,So calmly lit with sleep's pale light
1968,THE SLEEPER,Each feature was; so fair
1969,THE SLEEPER,Her forehead--every trouble was
1970,THE SLEEPER,Smooth'd out beneath her hair.
1971,THE SLEEPER,
1972,THE SLEEPER,"But though her mind in dream now moved,"
1973,THE SLEEPER,Still seemed her gaze to rest
1974,THE SLEEPER,"From out beneath her fast-sealed lids,"
1975,THE SLEEPER,"Above her moving breast,"
1976,THE SLEEPER,"On Ann, as quite, quite still she stood;"
1977,THE SLEEPER,Yet slumber lay so deep
1978,THE SLEEPER,Even her hands upon her lap
1979,THE SLEEPER,Seemed saturate with sleep.
1980,THE SLEEPER,"And as Ann peeped, a cloudlike dread"
1981,THE SLEEPER,"Stole over her, and then,"
1982,THE SLEEPER,"On stealthy, mouselike feet she trod,"
1983,THE SLEEPER,And tiptoed out again.

2065,THE LISTENERS,"'Is there anybody there?' said the Traveller,"
2066,THE LISTENERS,Knocking on the moonlit door;
2067,THE LISTENERS,And his horse in the silence champed the grasses
2068,THE LISTENERS,Of the forest's ferny floor:
2069,THE LISTENERS,"And a bird flew up out of the turret,"
2070,THE LISTENERS,Above the Traveller's head:
2071,THE LISTENERS,And he smote upon the door again a second time;
2072,THE LISTENERS,'Is there anybody there?' he said.
2073,THE LISTENERS,But no one descended to the Traveller;
2074,THE LISTENERS,No head from the leaf-fringed sill
2075,THE LISTENERS,"Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,"
2076,THE LISTENERS,Where he stood perplexed and still.
2077,THE LISTENERS,But only a host of phantom listeners
2078,THE LISTENERS,That dwelt in the lone house then
2079,THE LISTENERS,Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight
2080,THE LISTENERS,To that voice from the world of men:
2081,THE LISTENERS,"Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,"
2082,THE LISTENERS,"That goes down to the empty hall,"
2083,THE LISTENERS,Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken
2084,THE LISTENERS,By the lonely Traveller's call.
2085,THE LISTENERS,"And he felt in his heart their strangeness,"
2086,THE LISTENERS,"Their stillness answering his cry,"
2087,THE LISTENERS,"While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,"
2088,THE LISTENERS,'Neath the starred and leafy sky;
2089,THE LISTENERS,"For he suddenly smote on the door, even"
2090,THE LISTENERS,"Louder, and lifted his head:--"
2091,THE LISTENERS,"'Tell them I came, and no one answered,"
2092,THE LISTENERS,"That I kept my word,' he said."
2093,THE LISTENERS,"Never the least stir made the listeners,"
2094,THE LISTENERS,Though every word he spake
2095,THE LISTENERS,Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house
2096,THE LISTENERS,From the one man left awake:

2120,I,
2121,I,Time gathers to my name;
2122,I,Along the ways wheredown my feet have passed
2123,I,"I see the years with little triumph crowned,"
2124,I,"Exulting not for perils dared, downcast"
2125,I,And weary-eyed and desolate for shame
2126,I,Of having been unstirred of all the sound
2127,I,Of the deep music of the men that move
2128,I,Through the world's days in suffering and love.
2129,I,
2130,I,Poor barren years that brooded over-much
2131,I,"On your own burden, pale and stricken years--"
2132,I,"Go down to your oblivion, we part"
2133,I,With no reproach or ceremonial tears.
2134,I,Henceforth my hands are lifted to the touch
2135,I,"Of hands that labour with me, and my heart"
2136,I,Hereafter to the world's heart shall be set
2137,I,And its own pain forget.
2138,I,Time gathers to my name--
2139,I,"Days dead are dark; the days to be, a flame"
2140,I,"Of wonder and of promise, and great cries"
2141,I,Of travelling people reach me--I must rise.
2142,I,
2143,I,
2144,II,II
2145,II,
2146,II,Was I not man? Could I not rise alone
2147,II,"Above the shifting of the things that be,"
2148,II,Rise to the crest of all the stars and see
2149,II,The ways of all the world as from a throne?
2150,II,"Was I not man, with proud imperial will"
2151,II,To cancel all the secrets of high heaven?
2152,II,Should not my sole unbridled purpose fill
2153,II,All hidden paths with light when once was riven
2154,II,God's veil by my indomitable will?
2155,II,"So dreamt I, little man of little vision,"
2156,II,Great only in unconsecrated pride;
2157,II,"Man's pity grew from pity to derision,"
2158,II,"And still I thought, 'Albeit they deride,"
2159,II,Yet is it mine uncharted ways to dare
2160,II,"Unknown to these,"
2161,II,"And they shall stumble darkly, unaware"
2162,II,Of solemn mysteries
2163,II,Whereof the key is mine alone to bear.'
2164,II,
2165,II,"So I forgot my God, and I forgot"
2166,II,"The holy sweet communion of men,"
2167,II,"And moved in desolate places, where are not"
2168,II,Meek hands held out with patient healing when
2169,II,The hours are heavy with uncharitable pain;
2170,II,No company but vain
2171,II,And arrogant thoughts were with me at my side.
2172,II,"And ever to myself I lied,"
2173,II,Saying 'Apart from all men thus I go
2174,II,To know the things that they may never know.'
2175,II,
2176,II,
2177,III,III
2178,III,
2179,III,Then a great change befell:
2180,III,Long time I stood
2181,III,In witless hardihood
2182,III,With eyes on one sole changeless vision set--
2183,III,The deep disturbed fret
2184,III,Of men who made brief tarrying in hell
2185,III,On their earth-travelling.
2186,III,It was as though the lives of men should be
2187,III,"Set circle-wise, whereof one little span"
2188,III,Through which all passed was blackened with the wing
2189,III,"Of perilous evil, bateless misery."
2190,III,"But all beyond, making the whole complete"
2191,III,O'er which the travelling feet
2192,III,Of every man
2193,III,"Made way or ever he might come to death,"
2194,III,Was odorous with the breath
2195,III,"Of honey-laden flowers, and alive"
2196,III,With sacrificial ministrations sweet
2197,III,"Of man to man, and swift and holy loves,"
2198,III,"And large heroic hopes, whereby should thrive"
2199,III,Man's spirit as he moves
2200,III,From dawn of life to the great dawn of death.
2201,III,It was as though mine eyes were set alone
2202,III,"Upon that woeful passage of despair,"
2203,III,Until I held that life had never known
2204,III,Dominion but in this most troubled place
2205,III,Where many a ruined grace
2206,III,And many a friendless care
2207,III,Ran to and fro in sorrowful unrest.
2208,III,Still in my hand I pressed
2209,III,"Hope's fragile chalice, whence I drew deep draughts"
2210,III,Shaping belief that even yet should grow
2211,III,"Out of this dread confusion, as of broken crafts"
2212,III,"Driven along ungovernable seas,"
2213,III,"Some threads of order, and that I should know"
2214,III,After long vigil all the mysteries
2215,III,Of human wonder and of human fate.
2216,III,
2217,III,"O fool, O only great"
2218,III,"In pride unhallowed, O most blind of heart!"
2219,III,"Confusion but more dark confusion bred,"
2220,III,"Grief nurtured grief, I cried aloud and said,"
2221,III,"'Through trackless ways the soul of man is hurled,"
2222,III,"No sign upon the forehead of the skies,"
2223,III,"No beacon, and no chart"
2224,III,"Are given to him, and the inscrutable world"
2225,III,But mocks his scars and fills his mouth with dust.'
2226,III,
2227,III,'And lies bore lies
2228,III,"And lust bore lust,"
2229,III,"And the world was heavy with flowerless rods,"
2230,III,And pride outran
2231,III,The strength of a man
2232,III,Who had set himself in the place of gods'.
2233,III,
2234,III,
2235,IV,IV
2236,IV,
2237,IV,Soon was I then to gather bitter shame
2238,IV,"Of spirit, I had been most wildly proud--"
2239,IV,Yet in my pride had been
2240,IV,"Some little courage, formless as a cloud,"
2241,IV,"Unpiloted save by the vagrant wind,"
2242,IV,But still an earnest of the bonds that tame
2243,IV,"The legionary hates, of sacred loves that lean"
2244,IV,From the high soul of man towards his kind.
2245,IV,And all my grief
2246,IV,Had been for those I watched go to and fro
2247,IV,In uncompassioned woe
2248,IV,Along that little span my unbelief
2249,IV,Had fashioned in my vision as all life.
2250,IV,"Now even this so little virtue waned,"
2251,IV,For I became caught up into the strife
2252,IV,"That I had pitied, and my soul was stained"
2253,IV,"At last by that most venomous despair,"
2254,IV,Self-pity.
2255,IV,I no longer was aware
2256,IV,"Of any will to heal the world's unrest,"
2257,IV,"I suffered as it suffered, and I grew"
2258,IV,"Troubled in all my daily trafficking,"
2259,IV,Not with the large heroic trouble known
2260,IV,By proud adventurous men who would atone
2261,IV,With their own passionate pity for the sting
2262,IV,And anguish of a world of peril and snares;
2263,IV,It was the trouble of a soul in thrall
2264,IV,"To mean despairs,"
2265,IV,Driven about a waste where neither fall
2266,IV,"Of words from lips of love, nor consolation"
2267,IV,"Of grave eyes comforting, nor ministration"
2268,IV,Of hand or heart could pierce the deadly wall
2269,IV,"Of self--of self,--I was a living shame--"
2270,IV,A broken purpose. I had stood apart
2271,IV,"With pride rebellious and defiant heart,"
2272,IV,And now my pride had perished in the flame.
2273,IV,I cried for succour as a little child
2274,IV,Might supplicate whose days are undefiled--
2275,IV,For tutored pride and innocence are one.
2276,IV,
2277,IV,'To the gloom has won
2278,IV,A gleam of the sun
2279,IV,And into the barren desolate ways

2300,V,"The beauty of the roses uncreate,"
2301,V,"Imperial June, magnificent, elate"
2302,V,Beholding all the ripening loves that stray
2303,V,"Among her blossoms, and the golden time"
2304,V,"Of the full ear and bounty of the boughs,--"
2305,V,And the great hills and solemn chanting seas
2306,V,"And prodigal meadows, answering to the chime"
2307,V,"Of God's good year, and bearing on their brows"
2308,V,The glory of processional mysteries
2309,V,"From dawn to dawn, the woven shadow and shine"
2310,V,"Of the high moon, the twilight secrecies,"
2311,V,And the inscrutable wonder of the stars
2312,V,Flung out along the reaches of the night.
2313,V,
2314,V,"'And, the ancient might"
2315,V,Of the binding bars
2316,V,"Waned, as I woke to a new desire"

2327,VI,This re-discovered triumph of the earth
2328,VI,In high creative will and beauty's pride
2329,VI,"Established beyond the assaulting years,"
2330,VI,"It came to me, a music that compelled"
2331,VI,"Surrender of all tributary fears,"
2332,VI,"Full-throated, fierce and rhythmic with the wide"
2333,VI,"Beat of the pilgrim winds and labouring seas,"
2334,VI,Sent up from all the harbouring ways of earth
2335,VI,"Wherein the travelling feet of men have trod,"
2336,VI,Mounting the firmamental silences
2337,VI,And challenging the golden gates of God.

2380,VI,Though beauty's form may pale and pass.

2386,VI,"The song unsung, the cause unled,"
2387,VI,The freedom that no hope can gauge;

2416,VII,"Across the skies in ceremonial state,"
2417,VII,"To greet the men who lived triumphant days,"
2418,VII,And stormed the secret beauty of the world.

2438,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2439,JOSEPH AND MARY,"Mary, art thou the little maid"
2440,JOSEPH AND MARY,Who plucked me flowers in Spring?
2441,JOSEPH AND MARY,I know thee not; I feel afraid:
2442,JOSEPH AND MARY,Thou'rt strange this evening.
2443,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2444,JOSEPH AND MARY,A sweet and rustic girl I won
2445,JOSEPH AND MARY,What time the woods were green;
2446,JOSEPH AND MARY,"No woman with deep eyes that shone,"
2447,JOSEPH AND MARY,And the pale brows of a Queen.

2449,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2450,JOSEPH AND MARY,Mary: (inattentive to his words)
2451,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2452,JOSEPH AND MARY,A stranger came with feet of flame
2453,JOSEPH AND MARY,"And told me this strange thing,--"
2454,JOSEPH AND MARY,For all I was a village maid
2455,JOSEPH AND MARY,My son should be a King.
2456,JOSEPH AND MARY,

2464,JOSEPH AND MARY,Mary:
2465,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2466,JOSEPH AND MARY,"Do you hear, in the dark and starlit blue"

2470,JOSEPH AND MARY,Joseph:

2482,JOSEPH AND MARY,

2484,JOSEPH AND MARY,

2489,JOSEPH AND MARY,Mary:
2490,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2491,JOSEPH AND MARY,"The winter sun has stored his rays,"

2493,JOSEPH AND MARY,

2495,JOSEPH AND MARY,"O Joseph, what do you see?"
2496,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2497,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2498,JOSEPH AND MARY,Joseph:
2499,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2500,JOSEPH AND MARY,The snow lies quiet on the ground
2501,JOSEPH AND MARY,And glistens on the tree;
2502,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2503,JOSEPH AND MARY,"The sky is bright with a star's great light,"
2504,JOSEPH AND MARY,And clearly I behold
2505,JOSEPH AND MARY,"Three Kings descending yonder hill,"
2506,JOSEPH AND MARY,Whose crowns are crowns of gold.
2507,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2508,JOSEPH AND MARY,"O Mary, what do you hear and see"
2509,JOSEPH AND MARY,With your brow toward the West?
2510,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2511,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2512,JOSEPH AND MARY,Mary:
2513,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2514,JOSEPH AND MARY,The snow lies glistening on the tree
2515,JOSEPH AND MARY,And silent on Earth's breast;
2516,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2517,JOSEPH AND MARY,"And strong and tall, with lifted eyes"
2518,JOSEPH AND MARY,"Seven shepherds walk this way,"
2519,JOSEPH AND MARY,And angels breaking from the skies
2520,JOSEPH AND MARY,"Dance, and sing hymns, and pray."
2521,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2522,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2523,JOSEPH AND MARY,Joseph:
2524,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2525,JOSEPH AND MARY,I wonder much at these bright Kings;
2526,JOSEPH AND MARY,The shepherds I despise.

2528,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2529,JOSEPH AND MARY,Mary:
2530,JOSEPH AND MARY,
2531,JOSEPH AND MARY,"You know not what a shepherd sings,"
2532,JOSEPH AND MARY,Nor see his shining eyes.

2589,THE HARE,THE HARE
2590,THE HARE,
2591,THE HARE,
2592,THE HARE,"My hands were hot upon a hare,"
2593,THE HARE,"Half-strangled, struggling in a snare---"
2594,THE HARE,My knuckles at her warm wind-pipe--
2595,THE HARE,"When suddenly, her eyes shot back,"
2596,THE HARE,"Big, fearful, staggering and black;"
2597,THE HARE,"And ere I knew, my grip was slack;"
2598,THE HARE,"And I was clutching empty air,"
2599,THE HARE,"Half-mad, half-glad at my lost luck ..."
2600,THE HARE,When I awoke beside the stack.
2601,THE HARE,
2602,THE HARE,'Twas just the minute when the snipe
2603,THE HARE,"As though clock-wakened, every jack,"
2604,THE HARE,"An hour ere dawn, dart in and out"
2605,THE HARE,"The mist-wreaths filling syke and slack,"
2606,THE HARE,"And flutter wheeling round about,"
2607,THE HARE,And drumming out the Summer night.
2608,THE HARE,I lay star-gazing yet a bit;
2609,THE HARE,"Then, chilly-skinned, I sat upright,"
2610,THE HARE,To shrug the shivers from my back;
2611,THE HARE,"And, drawing out a straw to suck,"
2612,THE HARE,My teeth nipped through it at a bite ...
2613,THE HARE,The liveliest lad is out of pluck
2614,THE HARE,An hour ere dawn--a tame cock-sparrow--
2615,THE HARE,"When cold stars shiver through his marrow,"
2616,THE HARE,And wet mist soaks his mother-wit.
2617,THE HARE,
2618,THE HARE,"But, as the snipe dropped, one by one;"
2619,THE HARE,And one by one the stars blinked out;
2620,THE HARE,I knew 'twould only need the sun
2621,THE HARE,To send the shudders right about:
2622,THE HARE,"And as the clear East faded white,"
2623,THE HARE,I watched and wearied for the sun--
2624,THE HARE,"The jolly, welcome, friendly sun--"
2625,THE HARE,The sleepy sluggard of a sun
2626,THE HARE,"That still kept snoozing out of sight,"
2627,THE HARE,Though well he knew the night was done ...
2628,THE HARE,"And after all, he caught me dozing,"
2629,THE HARE,"And leapt up, laughing, in the sky"
2630,THE HARE,Just as my lazy eyes were closing:
2631,THE HARE,And it was good as gold to lie
2632,THE HARE,"Full-length among the straw, and feel"
2633,THE HARE,"The day wax warmer every minute,"
2634,THE HARE,"As, glowing glad, from head to heel."
2635,THE HARE,"I soaked, and rolled rejoicing in it ..."
2636,THE HARE,"When from, the corner of my eye,"
2637,THE HARE,"Upon a heathery knowe hard-by,"
2638,THE HARE,"With long lugs cocked, and eyes astare,"
2639,THE HARE,"Yet all serene, I saw a hare."
2640,THE HARE,
2641,THE HARE,"Upon my belly in the straw,"
2642,THE HARE,"I lay, and watched her sleek her fur,"
2643,THE HARE,"As, daintily, with well-licked paw,"
2644,THE HARE,She washed her face and neck and ears:
2645,THE HARE,"Then, clean and comely in the sun,"
2646,THE HARE,"She kicked her heels up, full of fun,"
2647,THE HARE,As if she did not care a pin
2648,THE HARE,"Though she should jump out of her skin,"
2649,THE HARE,"And leapt and lolloped, free of fears,"
2650,THE HARE,Until my heart frisked round with her.
2651,THE HARE,
2652,THE HARE,"'And yet, if I but lift my head,"
2653,THE HARE,"You'll scamper off, young Puss,' I said."
2654,THE HARE,"'Still, I can't lie, and watch you play,"
2655,THE HARE,Upon my belly half the day.
2656,THE HARE,The Lord alone knows where I'm going:
2657,THE HARE,"But, I had best be getting there."
2658,THE HARE,Last night I loosed you from the snare--
2659,THE HARE,"Asleep, or waking, who's for knowing!--"
2660,THE HARE,"So, I shall thank you now for showing"
2661,THE HARE,Which art to take to bring me where
2662,THE HARE,My luck awaits me. When you're ready
2663,THE HARE,"To start, I'll follow on your track."
2664,THE HARE,"Though slow of foot, I'm sure and steady ...'"
2665,THE HARE,"She pricked her ears, then set them back;"
2666,THE HARE,And like a shot was out of sight:
2667,THE HARE,"And, with a happy heart and light,"
2668,THE HARE,As quickly I was on my feet;
2669,THE HARE,"And following the way she went,"
2670,THE HARE,"Keen as a lurcher on the scent,"
2671,THE HARE,"Across the heather and the bent,"
2672,THE HARE,Across the quaking moss and peat.
2673,THE HARE,"Of course, I lost her soon enough,"
2674,THE HARE,For moorland tracks are steep and rough;
2675,THE HARE,And hares are made of nimbler stuff
2676,THE HARE,"Than any lad of seventeen,"
2677,THE HARE,"However lanky-legged and tough,"
2678,THE HARE,However kestrel-eyed and keen:
2679,THE HARE,And I'd at last to stop and eat
2680,THE HARE,The little bit of bread and meat
2681,THE HARE,Left in my pocket overnight.
2682,THE HARE,"So, in a hollow, snug and green,"
2683,THE HARE,"I sat beside a burn, and dipped"
2684,THE HARE,The dry bread in an icy pool;
2685,THE HARE,And munched a breakfast fresh and cool ...
2686,THE HARE,And then sat gaping like a fool ...
2687,THE HARE,"For, right before my very eyes,"
2688,THE HARE,"With lugs acock and eyes astare,"
2689,THE HARE,I saw again the selfsame hare.
2690,THE HARE,
2691,THE HARE,"So, up I jumped, and off she slipped;"
2692,THE HARE,And I kept sight of her until
2693,THE HARE,"I stumbled in a hole, and tripped,"
2694,THE HARE,"And came a heavy, headlong spill;"
2695,THE HARE,"And she, ere I'd the wit to rise,"
2696,THE HARE,"Was o'er the hill, and out of sight:"
2697,THE HARE,"And, sore and shaken with the tumbling,"
2698,THE HARE,"And sicker at my foot for stumbling,"
2699,THE HARE,"I cursed my luck, and went on, grumbling,"
2700,THE HARE,The way her flying heels had fled.
2701,THE HARE,
2702,THE HARE,"The sky was cloudless overhead,"
2703,THE HARE,And just alive with larks asinging;
2704,THE HARE,And in a twinkling I was swinging
2705,THE HARE,"Across the windy hills, lighthearted."
2706,THE HARE,"A kestrel at my footstep started,"
2707,THE HARE,"Just pouncing on a frightened mouse,"
2708,THE HARE,And hung o'er head with wings a-hover;
2709,THE HARE,Through rustling heath an adder darted:
2710,THE HARE,A hundred rabbits bobbed to cover:
2711,THE HARE,"A weasel, sleek and rusty-red,"
2712,THE HARE,Popped out of sight as quick as winking:
2713,THE HARE,I saw a grizzled vixen slinking
2714,THE HARE,Behind a clucking brood of grouse
2715,THE HARE,That rose and cackled at my coming:
2716,THE HARE,And all about my way were flying
2717,THE HARE,"The peewit, with their slow wings creaking;"
2718,THE HARE,"And little jack-snipe darted, drumming:"
2719,THE HARE,And now and then a golden plover
2720,THE HARE,Or redshank piped with reedy whistle.
2721,THE HARE,But never shaken bent or thistle
2722,THE HARE,Betrayed the quarry I was seeking;
2723,THE HARE,"And not an instant, anywhere"
2724,THE HARE,Did I clap eyes upon a hare.
2725,THE HARE,
2726,THE HARE,"So, travelling still, the twilight caught me;"
2727,THE HARE,"And as I stumbled on, I muttered:"
2728,THE HARE,'A deal of luck the hare has brought me!
2729,THE HARE,The wind and I must spend together
2730,THE HARE,A hungry night among the heather.
2731,THE HARE,"If I'd her here ...' And as I uttered,"
2732,THE HARE,"I tripped, and heard a frightened squeal;"
2733,THE HARE,And dropped my hands in time to feel
2734,THE HARE,The hare just bolting 'twixt my feet.
2735,THE HARE,She slipped my clutch: and I stood there
2736,THE HARE,"And cursed that devil-littered hare,"
2737,THE HARE,That left me stranded in the dark
2738,THE HARE,In that wide waste of quaggy peat
2739,THE HARE,Beneath black night without a spark:
2740,THE HARE,"When, looking up, I saw a flare"
2741,THE HARE,"Upon a far-off hill, and said:"
2742,THE HARE,"'By God, the heather is afire!"
2743,THE HARE,It's mischief at this time of year ...'
2744,THE HARE,"And then, as one bright flame shot higher,"
2745,THE HARE,"And booths and vans stood out quite clear,"
2746,THE HARE,My wits came back into my head;
2747,THE HARE,And I remembered Brough Hill Fair.
2748,THE HARE,And as I stumbled towards the glare
2749,THE HARE,I knew the sudden kindling meant
2750,THE HARE,The Fair was over for the day;
2751,THE HARE,And all the cattle-folk away;
2752,THE HARE,And gipsy folk and tinkers now
2753,THE HARE,Were lighting supper-fires without
2754,THE HARE,Each caravan and booth and tent.
2755,THE HARE,And as I climbed the stiff hill-brow
2756,THE HARE,I quite forgot my lucky hare.
2757,THE HARE,I'd something else to think about:
2758,THE HARE,For well I knew there's broken meat
2759,THE HARE,For empty bellies after fair-time;
2760,THE HARE,And looked to have a royal rare time
2761,THE HARE,With something rich and prime to eat;
2762,THE HARE,And then to lie and toast my feet
2763,THE HARE,All night beside the biggest fire.
2764,THE HARE,"But, even as I neared the first,"
2765,THE HARE,A pleasant whiff of stewing burst
2766,THE HARE,From out a smoking pot a-bubble:
2767,THE HARE,And as I stopped behind the folk
2768,THE HARE,"Who sprawled around, and watched it seething,"
2769,THE HARE,"A woman heard my eager breathing,"
2770,THE HARE,"And, turning, caught my hungry eye:"
2771,THE HARE,"And called out to me: 'Draw in nigher,"
2772,THE HARE,Unless you find it too much trouble;
2773,THE HARE,"Or you've a nose for better fare,"
2774,THE HARE,And go to supper with the Squire ...
2775,THE HARE,You've got the hungry parson's air!'
2776,THE HARE,"And all looked up, and took the joke,"
2777,THE HARE,As I dropped gladly to the ground
2778,THE HARE,"Among them, where they all lay gazing"
2779,THE HARE,Upon the bubbling and the blazing.
2780,THE HARE,My eyes were dazzled by the fire
2781,THE HARE,At first; and then I glanced around;
2782,THE HARE,"And in those swarthy, fire-lit faces--"
2783,THE HARE,Though drowsing in the glare and heat
2784,THE HARE,"And snuffing the warm savour in,"
2785,THE HARE,Dead-certain of their fill of meat--
2786,THE HARE,"I felt the bit between the teeth,"
2787,THE HARE,"The flying heels, the broken traces,"
2788,THE HARE,And heard the highroad ring beneath
2789,THE HARE,The trampling hoofs; and knew them kin.
2790,THE HARE,"Then for the first time, standing there"
2791,THE HARE,"Behind the woman who had hailed me,"
2792,THE HARE,I saw a girl with eyes astare
2793,THE HARE,That looked in terror o'er my head;
2794,THE HARE,"And, all at once, my courage failed me ..."
2795,THE HARE,"For now again, and sore-adread,"
2796,THE HARE,"My hands were hot upon a hare,"
2797,THE HARE,"That struggled, strangling in the snare ..."
2798,THE HARE,"Then once more as the girl stood clear,"
2799,THE HARE,Before me--quaking cold with fear--
2800,THE HARE,I saw the hare look from her eyes ...
2801,THE HARE,
2802,THE HARE,"And when, at last, I turned to see"
2803,THE HARE,"What held her scared, I saw a man--"
2804,THE HARE,A fat man with dull eyes aleer--
2805,THE HARE,Within the shadow of the van;
2806,THE HARE,And I was on the point to rise
2807,THE HARE,To send him spinning 'mid the wheels
2808,THE HARE,And stop his leering grin with mud ...
2809,THE HARE,And would have done it in a tick ...
2810,THE HARE,"When, suddenly, alive with fright,"
2811,THE HARE,"She started, with red, parted lips,"
2812,THE HARE,"As though she guessed we'd come to grips,"
2813,THE HARE,And turned her black eyes full on me ...
2814,THE HARE,And as I looked into their light
2815,THE HARE,"My heart forgot the lust of fight,"
2816,THE HARE,"And something shot me to the quick,"
2817,THE HARE,"And ran like wildfire through my blood,"
2818,THE HARE,And tingled to my finger-tips ...
2819,THE HARE,"And, in a dazzling flash, I knew"
2820,THE HARE,I'd never been alive before ...
2821,THE HARE,And she was mine for evermore.
2822,THE HARE,
2823,THE HARE,While all the others slept asnore
2824,THE HARE,"In caravan and tent that night,"
2825,THE HARE,I lay alone beside the fire;
2826,THE HARE,"And stared into its blazing core,"
2827,THE HARE,"With eyes that would not shut or tire,"
2828,THE HARE,"Because the best of all was true,"
2829,THE HARE,And they looked still into the light
2830,THE HARE,"Of her eyes, burning ever bright."
2831,THE HARE,Within the brightest coal for me ...
2832,THE HARE,"Once more, I saw her, as she started,"
2833,THE HARE,And glanced at me with red lips parted:
2834,THE HARE,"And as she looked, the frightened hare"
2835,THE HARE,"Had fled her eyes; and merrily,"
2836,THE HARE,"She smiled, with fine teeth flashing white,"
2837,THE HARE,"As though she, too, were happy-hearted ..."
2838,THE HARE,"Then she had trembled suddenly,"
2839,THE HARE,"And dropped her eyes, as that fat man"
2840,THE HARE,"Stepped from the shadow of the van,"
2841,THE HARE,"And joined the circle, as the pot"
2842,THE HARE,"Was lifted off, and, piping-hot,"
2843,THE HARE,The supper steamed in wooden bowls.
2844,THE HARE,"Yet, she had hardly touched a bite;"
2845,THE HARE,And never raised her eyes all night
2846,THE HARE,"To mine again; but on the coals,"
2847,THE HARE,"As I sat staring, she had stared--"
2848,THE HARE,"The black curls, shining round her head"
2849,THE HARE,"From under the red kerchief, tied"
2850,THE HARE,So nattily beneath her chin--
2851,THE HARE,And she had stolen off to bed
2852,THE HARE,"Quite early, looking dazed and scared."
2853,THE HARE,"Then, all agape and sleepy-eyed,"
2854,THE HARE,Ere long the others had turned in:
2855,THE HARE,"And I was rid of that fat man,"
2856,THE HARE,Who slouched away to his own van.
2857,THE HARE,
2858,THE HARE,"And now, before her van, I lay,"
2859,THE HARE,"With sleepless eyes, awaiting day;"
2860,THE HARE,And as I gazed upon the glare
2861,THE HARE,"I heard, behind, a gentle stir:"
2862,THE HARE,"And, turning round, I looked on her"
2863,THE HARE,Where she stood on the little stair
2864,THE HARE,"Outside the van, with listening air--"
2865,THE HARE,"And, in her eyes, the hunted hare ..."
2866,THE HARE,"And then, I saw her slip away,"
2867,THE HARE,"A bundle underneath her arm,"
2868,THE HARE,Without a single glance at me.
2869,THE HARE,"I lay a moment wondering,"
2870,THE HARE,"My heart a-thump like anything,"
2871,THE HARE,"Then, fearing she should come to harm,"
2872,THE HARE,"I rose, and followed speedily"
2873,THE HARE,Where she had vanished in the night.
2874,THE HARE,And as she heard my step behind
2875,THE HARE,"She started, and stopt dead with fright;"
2876,THE HARE,Then blundered on as if struck blind:
2877,THE HARE,"And now as I caught up with her,"
2878,THE HARE,"Just as she took the moorland track,"
2879,THE HARE,"I saw the hare's eyes, big and black ..."
2880,THE HARE,She made as though she'd double back ...
2881,THE HARE,"But when she looked into my eyes,"
2882,THE HARE,She stood quite still and did not stir ...
2883,THE HARE,And picking up her fallen pack
2884,THE HARE,I tucked it 'neath my arm; and she
2885,THE HARE,"Just took her luck quite quietly,"
2886,THE HARE,"As she must take what chance might come,"
2887,THE HARE,"And would not have it otherwise,"
2888,THE HARE,"And walked into the night with me,"
2889,THE HARE,Without a word across the fells.
2890,THE HARE,
2891,THE HARE,"And all about us, through the night,"
2892,THE HARE,"The mists were stealing, cold and white,"
2893,THE HARE,Down every rushy syke or slack:
2894,THE HARE,"But, soon the moon swung into sight;"
2895,THE HARE,And as we went my heart was light.
2896,THE HARE,And singing like a burn in flood:
2897,THE HARE,And in my ears were tinkling bells;
2898,THE HARE,My body was a rattled drum:
2899,THE HARE,And fifes were shrilling through my blood
2900,THE HARE,"That summer night, to think that she"
2901,THE HARE,Was walking through the world with me.
2902,THE HARE,
2903,THE HARE,But when the air with dawn was chill.
2904,THE HARE,"As we were travelling down a hill,"
2905,THE HARE,She broke her silence with low-sobbing;
2906,THE HARE,"And told her tale, her bosom throbbing"
2907,THE HARE,As though her very heart were shaken
2908,THE HARE,With fear she'd yet be overtaken ...
2909,THE HARE,She'd always lived in caravans--
2910,THE HARE,"Her father's, gay as any man's,"
2911,THE HARE,"Grass-green, picked out with red and yellow"
2912,THE HARE,And glittering brave with burnished brass
2913,THE HARE,"That sparkled in the sun like flame,"
2914,THE HARE,"And window curtains, white as snow ..."
2915,THE HARE,"But, they had died, ten years ago,"
2916,THE HARE,"Her parents both, when fever came ..."
2917,THE HARE,"And they were buried, side by side."
2918,THE HARE,Somewhere beneath the wayside grass ...
2919,THE HARE,"In times of sickness, they kept wide"
2920,THE HARE,"Of towns and busybodies, so"
2921,THE HARE,No parson's or policeman's tricks
2922,THE HARE,Should bother them when in a fix ...
2923,THE HARE,Her father never could abide
2924,THE HARE,"A black coat or a blue, poor man ..."
2925,THE HARE,"And so, Long Dick, a kindly fellow,"
2926,THE HARE,"When you could keep him from the can,"
2927,THE HARE,"And Meg, his easy-going wife,"
2928,THE HARE,Had taken her into their van;
2929,THE HARE,And kept her since her parents died ...
2930,THE HARE,"And she had lived a happy life,"
2931,THE HARE,Until Fat Pete's young wife was taken ...
2932,THE HARE,"But, ever since, he'd pestered her ..."
2933,THE HARE,"And she dared scarcely breathe or stir,"
2934,THE HARE,Lest she should see his eyes aleer ...
2935,THE HARE,"And many a night she'd lain and shaken,"
2936,THE HARE,And very nearly died of fear--
2937,THE HARE,Though safe enough within the van
2938,THE HARE,With Mother Meg and her good-man--
2939,THE HARE,"For, since Fat Pete was Long Dick's friend,"
2940,THE HARE,"And they were thick and sweet as honey,"
2941,THE HARE,"And Dick owed Pete a pot of money,"
2942,THE HARE,She knew too well how it must end ...
2943,THE HARE,And she would rather lie stone dead
2944,THE HARE,Beneath the wayside grass than wed
2945,THE HARE,"With leering Pete, and live the life,"
2946,THE HARE,"And die the death, of his first wife ..."
2947,THE HARE,"And so, last night, clean-daft with dread,"
2948,THE HARE,She'd bundled up a pack and fled ...
2949,THE HARE,
2950,THE HARE,"When all the sobbing tale was out,"
2951,THE HARE,"She dried her eyes, and looked about,"
2952,THE HARE,"As though she'd left all fear behind,"
2953,THE HARE,"And out of sight were out of mind,"
2954,THE HARE,"Then, when the dawn was burning red,"
2955,THE HARE,'I'm hungry as a hawk!' she said:
2956,THE HARE,"And from the bundle took out bread,"
2957,THE HARE,And at the happy end of night
2958,THE HARE,We sat together by a burn:
2959,THE HARE,"And ate a thick slice, turn by turn;"
2960,THE HARE,And laughed and kissed between each bite.
2961,THE HARE,
2962,THE HARE,"Then, up again, and on our way"
2963,THE HARE,We went; and tramped the livelong day
2964,THE HARE,"The moorland trackways, steep and rough,"
2965,THE HARE,Though there was little fear enough
2966,THE HARE,That they would follow on our flight.
2967,THE HARE,
2968,THE HARE,And then again a shiny night
2969,THE HARE,"Among the honey-scented heather,"
2970,THE HARE,"We wandered in the moonblaze bright,"
2971,THE HARE,"Together through a land of light,"
2972,THE HARE,A lad and lass alone with life.
2973,THE HARE,"And merrily we laughed together,"
2974,THE HARE,"When, starting up from sleep, we heard"
2975,THE HARE,The cock-grouse talking to his wife ...
2976,THE HARE,And 'Old Fat Pete' she called the bird.
2977,THE HARE,
2978,THE HARE,Six months and more have cantered by:
2979,THE HARE,"And, Winter past, we're out again--"
2980,THE HARE,We've left the fat and weatherwise
2981,THE HARE,To keep their coops and reeking sties.
2982,THE HARE,"And eat their fill of oven-pies,"
2983,THE HARE,While we win free and out again
2984,THE HARE,To take potluck beneath the sky
2985,THE HARE,With sun and moon and wind and rain.
2986,THE HARE,"Six happy months ... and yet, at night,"
2987,THE HARE,"I've often wakened in affright,"
2988,THE HARE,"And looked upon her lying there,"
2989,THE HARE,"Beside me sleeping quietly,"
2990,THE HARE,"Adread that when she waked, I'd see"
2991,THE HARE,The hunted hare within her eyes.
2992,THE HARE,
2993,THE HARE,"And only last night, as I slept"
2994,THE HARE,Beneath the shelter of a stack ...
2995,THE HARE,"My hands were hot upon a hare,"
2996,THE HARE,"Half-strangled, struggling in the snare,"
2997,THE HARE,"When, suddenly, her eyes shot back,"
2998,THE HARE,"Big, fearful, staggering and black;"
2999,THE HARE,"And ere I knew, my grip was slack,"
3000,THE HARE,And I was clutching empty air ...
3001,THE HARE,Bolt-upright from my sleep I leapt ...
3002,THE HARE,Her place was empty in the straw ...
3003,THE HARE,"And then, with quaking heart, I saw"
3004,THE HARE,"That she was standing in the night,"
3005,THE HARE,A leveret cuddled to her breast ...
3006,THE HARE,
3007,THE HARE,I spoke no word; but as the light
3008,THE HARE,"Through banks of Eastern cloud was breaking,"
3009,THE HARE,"She turned, and saw that I was waking:"
3010,THE HARE,And told me how she could not rest;
3011,THE HARE,"And, rising in the night, she'd found"
3012,THE HARE,This baby-hare crouched on the ground;
3013,THE HARE,And she had nursed it quite a while;
3014,THE HARE,"But, now, she'd better let it go ..."
3015,THE HARE,Its mother would be fretting so ...
3016,THE HARE,A mother's heart ...
3017,THE HARE,"I saw her smile,"
3018,THE HARE,And look at me with tender eyes;
3019,THE HARE,"And as I looked into their light,"
3020,THE HARE,"My foolish, fearful heart grew wise ..."
3021,THE HARE,"And now, I knew that never there"
3022,THE HARE,"I'd see again the startled hare,"
3023,THE HARE,Or need to dread the dreams of night.

3034,GERANIUMS,"In some black-throated alley's stench and heat,"
3035,GERANIUMS,"Oblivious of the racket of the street,"
3036,GERANIUMS,A poor old weary woman lies in bed.
3037,GERANIUMS,
3038,GERANIUMS,"Broken with lust and drink, blear-eyed and ill,"
3039,GERANIUMS,"Her battered bonnet nodding on her head,"
3040,GERANIUMS,From a dark arch she clutched my sleeve and said:

3062,DEVIL'S EDGE,
3063,DEVIL'S EDGE,
3064,DEVIL'S EDGE,"All night I lay on Devil's Edge,"
3065,DEVIL'S EDGE,Along an overhanging ledge
3066,DEVIL'S EDGE,Between the sky and sea:
3067,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And as I rested 'waiting sleep,"
3068,DEVIL'S EDGE,The windless sky and soundless deep
3069,DEVIL'S EDGE,"In one dim, blue infinity"
3070,DEVIL'S EDGE,Of starry peace encompassed me.
3071,DEVIL'S EDGE,
3072,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And I remembered, drowsily,"
3073,DEVIL'S EDGE,How 'mid the hills last night I'd lain
3074,DEVIL'S EDGE,Beside a singing moorland burn;
3075,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And waked at dawn, to feel the rain"
3076,DEVIL'S EDGE,"Fall on my face, as on the fern"
3077,DEVIL'S EDGE,That drooped about my heather-bed;
3078,DEVIL'S EDGE,And how by noon the wind had blown
3079,DEVIL'S EDGE,"The last grey shred from out the sky,"
3080,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And blew my homespun jacket dry,"
3081,DEVIL'S EDGE,As I stood on the topmost stone
3082,DEVIL'S EDGE,"That crowns the cairn on Hawkshaw Head,"
3083,DEVIL'S EDGE,And caught a gleam of far-off sea;
3084,DEVIL'S EDGE,And heard the wind sing in the bent
3085,DEVIL'S EDGE,Like those far waters calling me:
3086,DEVIL'S EDGE,"When, my heart answering to the call,"
3087,DEVIL'S EDGE,"I followed down the seaward stream,"
3088,DEVIL'S EDGE,By silent pool and singing fall;
3089,DEVIL'S EDGE,"Till with a quiet, keen content,"
3090,DEVIL'S EDGE,"I watched the sun, a crimson ball,"
3091,DEVIL'S EDGE,"Shoot through grey seas a fiery gleam,"
3092,DEVIL'S EDGE,Then sink in opal deeps from sight.
3093,DEVIL'S EDGE,
3094,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And with the coming on of night,"
3095,DEVIL'S EDGE,"The wind had dropped: and as I lay,"
3096,DEVIL'S EDGE,"Retracing all the happy day,"
3097,DEVIL'S EDGE,And gazing long and dreamily
3098,DEVIL'S EDGE,"Across the dim, unsounding sea,"
3099,DEVIL'S EDGE,Over the far horizon came
3100,DEVIL'S EDGE,A sudden sail of amber flame;
3101,DEVIL'S EDGE,And soon the new moon rode on high
3102,DEVIL'S EDGE,Through cloudless deeps of crystal sky.
3103,DEVIL'S EDGE,
3104,DEVIL'S EDGE,Too holy seemed the night for sleep;
3105,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And yet, I must have slept, it seems;"
3106,DEVIL'S EDGE,"For, suddenly, I woke to hear"
3107,DEVIL'S EDGE,"A strange voice singing, shrill and clear,"
3108,DEVIL'S EDGE,Down in a gully black and deep
3109,DEVIL'S EDGE,That cleft the beetling crag in twain.
3110,DEVIL'S EDGE,It seemed the very voice of dreams
3111,DEVIL'S EDGE,That drive hag-ridden souls in fear
3112,DEVIL'S EDGE,"Through echoing, unearthly vales,"
3113,DEVIL'S EDGE,"To plunge in black, slow-crawling streams,"
3114,DEVIL'S EDGE,"Seeking to drown that cry, in vain ..."
3115,DEVIL'S EDGE,Or some sea creature's voice that wails
3116,DEVIL'S EDGE,"Through blind, white banks of fog unlifting"
3117,DEVIL'S EDGE,To God-forgotten sailors drifting
3118,DEVIL'S EDGE,Rudderless to death ...
3119,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And as I heard,"
3120,DEVIL'S EDGE,"Though no wind stirred,"
3121,DEVIL'S EDGE,An icy breath
3122,DEVIL'S EDGE,Was in my hair ...
3123,DEVIL'S EDGE,And clutched my heart with cold despair ...
3124,DEVIL'S EDGE,"But, as the wild song died away,"
3125,DEVIL'S EDGE,There came a faltering break
3126,DEVIL'S EDGE,That shivered to a sobbing fall;
3127,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And seemed half-human, after all ..."
3128,DEVIL'S EDGE,
3129,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And yet, what foot could find a track"
3130,DEVIL'S EDGE,"In that deep gully, sheer and black ..."
3131,DEVIL'S EDGE,And singing wildly in the night!
3132,DEVIL'S EDGE,"So, wondering I lay awake,"
3133,DEVIL'S EDGE,Until the coming of the light
3134,DEVIL'S EDGE,Brought day's familiar presence back.
3135,DEVIL'S EDGE,
3136,DEVIL'S EDGE,Down by the harbour-mouth that day.
3137,DEVIL'S EDGE,A fisher told the tale to me.
3138,DEVIL'S EDGE,"Three months before, while out at sea,"
3139,DEVIL'S EDGE,"Young Philip Burn was lost, though how,"
3140,DEVIL'S EDGE,"None knew, and none would ever know."
3141,DEVIL'S EDGE,The boat becalmed at noonday lay ...
3142,DEVIL'S EDGE,And not a ripple on the sea ...
3143,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And Philip standing in the bow,"
3144,DEVIL'S EDGE,When his six comrades went below
3145,DEVIL'S EDGE,"To sleep away an hour or so,"
3146,DEVIL'S EDGE,"Dog-tired with working day and night,"
3147,DEVIL'S EDGE,While he kept watch ... and not a sound
3148,DEVIL'S EDGE,"They heard, until, at set of sun"
3149,DEVIL'S EDGE,They woke; and coming up they found
3150,DEVIL'S EDGE,"The deck was empty, Philip gone ..."
3151,DEVIL'S EDGE,Yet not another boat in sight ...
3152,DEVIL'S EDGE,And not a ripple on the sea.
3153,DEVIL'S EDGE,"How he had vanished, none could tell."
3154,DEVIL'S EDGE,They only knew the lad was dead
3155,DEVIL'S EDGE,"They'd left but now, alive and well ..."
3156,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And he, poor fellow, newly-wed ..."
3157,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And when they broke the news to her,"
3158,DEVIL'S EDGE,She spoke no word to anyone:
3159,DEVIL'S EDGE,"But sat all day, and would not stir--"
3160,DEVIL'S EDGE,"Just staring, staring in the fire,"
3161,DEVIL'S EDGE,With eyes that never seemed to tire;
3162,DEVIL'S EDGE,"Until, at last, the day was done,"
3163,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And darkness came; when she would rise,"
3164,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And seek the door with queer, wild eyes;"
3165,DEVIL'S EDGE,And wander singing all the night
3166,DEVIL'S EDGE,Unearthly songs beside the sea:
3167,DEVIL'S EDGE,But always the first blink of light
3168,DEVIL'S EDGE,Would find her back at her own door.
3169,DEVIL'S EDGE,
3170,DEVIL'S EDGE,'Twas Winter when I came once more
3171,DEVIL'S EDGE,To that old village by the shore;
3172,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And as, at night, I climbed the street,"
3173,DEVIL'S EDGE,"I heard a singing, low and sweet,"
3174,DEVIL'S EDGE,Within a cottage near at hand:
3175,DEVIL'S EDGE,And I was glad awhile to stand
3176,DEVIL'S EDGE,And listen by the glowing pane:
3177,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And as I hearkened, that sweet strain"
3178,DEVIL'S EDGE,Brought back the night when I had lain
3179,DEVIL'S EDGE,Awake on Devil's Edge ...
3180,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And now I knew the voice again,"
3181,DEVIL'S EDGE,"So different, free of pain and fear--"
3182,DEVIL'S EDGE,Its terror turned to tenderness--
3183,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And yet the same voice none the less,"
3184,DEVIL'S EDGE,Though singing now so true and clear:
3185,DEVIL'S EDGE,"And drawing nigh the window-ledge,"
3186,DEVIL'S EDGE,I watched the mother sing to rest
3187,DEVIL'S EDGE,The baby snuggling to her breast.

3206,SNAP-DRAGON,She bade me follow to her garden where
3207,SNAP-DRAGON,The mellow sunlight stood as in a cup
3208,SNAP-DRAGON,Between the old grey walls; I did not dare
3209,SNAP-DRAGON,"To raise my face, I did not dare look up"
3210,SNAP-DRAGON,Lest her bright eyes like sparrows should fly in
3211,SNAP-DRAGON,My windows of discovery and shrill 'Sin!'
3212,SNAP-DRAGON,
3213,SNAP-DRAGON,So with a downcast mien and laughing voice
3214,SNAP-DRAGON,"I followed, followed the swing of her white dress"
3215,SNAP-DRAGON,That rocked in a lilt along: I watched the poise
3216,SNAP-DRAGON,"Of her feet as they flew for a space, then paused to press"
3217,SNAP-DRAGON,The grass deep down with the royal burden of her:
3218,SNAP-DRAGON,And gladly I'd offered my breast to the tread of her.
3219,SNAP-DRAGON,
3220,SNAP-DRAGON,"'I like to see,' she said, and she crouched her down,"
3221,SNAP-DRAGON,She sunk into my sight like a settling bird;
3222,SNAP-DRAGON,And her bosom couched in the confines of her gown
3223,SNAP-DRAGON,"Like heavy birds at rest there, softly stirred"

3225,SNAP-DRAGON,'The snap-dragon put out his tongue at me.'
3226,SNAP-DRAGON,
3227,SNAP-DRAGON,"She laughed, she reached her hand out to the flower"

3229,SNAP-DRAGON,"Strangled, my heart swelled up so full"
3230,SNAP-DRAGON,"As if it would burst its wineskin in my throat,"
3231,SNAP-DRAGON,Choke me in my own crimson; I watched her pull

3233,SNAP-DRAGON,
3234,SNAP-DRAGON,Over my eyes and I was blind--
3235,SNAP-DRAGON,Her large brown hand stretched over
3236,SNAP-DRAGON,"The windows of my mind,"
3237,SNAP-DRAGON,And in the dark I did discover
3238,SNAP-DRAGON,Things I was out to find:
3239,SNAP-DRAGON,"My grail, a brown bowl twined"
3240,SNAP-DRAGON,"With swollen veins that met in the wrist,"
3241,SNAP-DRAGON,Under whose brown the amethyst
3242,SNAP-DRAGON,I longed to taste: and I longed to turn
3243,SNAP-DRAGON,"My heart's red measure in her cup,"
3244,SNAP-DRAGON,I longed to feel my hot blood burn
3245,SNAP-DRAGON,With the lambent amethyst in her cup.
3246,SNAP-DRAGON,
3247,SNAP-DRAGON,Then suddenly she looked up
3248,SNAP-DRAGON,And I was blind in a tawny-gold day
3249,SNAP-DRAGON,Till she took her eyes away.
3250,SNAP-DRAGON,
3251,SNAP-DRAGON,So she came down from above
3252,SNAP-DRAGON,And emptied my heart of love ...
3253,SNAP-DRAGON,So I held my heart aloft
3254,SNAP-DRAGON,"To the cuckoo that fluttered above,"
3255,SNAP-DRAGON,And she settled soft.
3256,SNAP-DRAGON,
3257,SNAP-DRAGON,It seemed that I and the morning world
3258,SNAP-DRAGON,Were pressed cup-shape to take this reiver
3259,SNAP-DRAGON,Bird who was weary to have furled
3260,SNAP-DRAGON,"Her wings on us,"
3261,SNAP-DRAGON,As we were weary to receive her:
3262,SNAP-DRAGON,
3263,SNAP-DRAGON,"This bird, this rich"
3264,SNAP-DRAGON,"Sumptuous central grain,"
3265,SNAP-DRAGON,"This mutable witch,"
3266,SNAP-DRAGON,This one refrain.
3267,SNAP-DRAGON,"This laugh in the fight,"
3268,SNAP-DRAGON,"This clot of light,"
3269,SNAP-DRAGON,This core of night.
3270,SNAP-DRAGON,
3271,SNAP-DRAGON,"She spoke, and I closed my eyes"
3272,SNAP-DRAGON,To shut hallucinations out.
3273,SNAP-DRAGON,I echoed with surprise
3274,SNAP-DRAGON,Hearing my mere lips shout
3275,SNAP-DRAGON,The answer they did devise.
3276,SNAP-DRAGON,
3277,SNAP-DRAGON,"Again, I saw a brown bird hover"
3278,SNAP-DRAGON,Over the flowers at my feet;
3279,SNAP-DRAGON,I felt a brown bird hover
3280,SNAP-DRAGON,"Over my heart, and sweet"
3281,SNAP-DRAGON,Its shadow lay on my heart.
3282,SNAP-DRAGON,I thought I saw on the clover
3283,SNAP-DRAGON,A brown bee pulling apart
3284,SNAP-DRAGON,The closed flesh of the clover
3285,SNAP-DRAGON,And burrowing in its heart.
3286,SNAP-DRAGON,
3287,SNAP-DRAGON,"She moved her hand, and again"
3288,SNAP-DRAGON,I felt the brown bird hover
3289,SNAP-DRAGON,Over my heart ... and then
3290,SNAP-DRAGON,"The bird came down on my heart,"
3291,SNAP-DRAGON,As on a nest the rover
3292,SNAP-DRAGON,"Cuckoo comes, and shoves over"
3293,SNAP-DRAGON,The brim each careful part
3294,SNAP-DRAGON,"Of love, takes possession and settles her down,"
3295,SNAP-DRAGON,With her wings and her feathers does drown
3296,SNAP-DRAGON,The nest in a heat of love.
3297,SNAP-DRAGON,
3298,SNAP-DRAGON,She turned her flushed face to me for the glint
3299,SNAP-DRAGON,"Of a moment. 'See,' she laughed, 'if you also"
3300,SNAP-DRAGON,Can make them yawn.' I put my hand to the dint
3301,SNAP-DRAGON,"In the flower's throat, and the flower gaped wide with woe."
3302,SNAP-DRAGON,"She watched, she went of a sudden intensely still,"
3303,SNAP-DRAGON,"She watched my hand, and I let her watch her fill."
3304,SNAP-DRAGON,
3305,SNAP-DRAGON,"I pressed the wretched, throttled flower between"
3306,SNAP-DRAGON,"My fingers, till its head lay back, its fangs"
3307,SNAP-DRAGON,"Poised at her: like a weapon my hand stood white and keen,"
3308,SNAP-DRAGON,And I held the choked flower-serpent in its pangs
3309,SNAP-DRAGON,"Of mordant anguish till she ceased to laugh,"
3310,SNAP-DRAGON,"Until her pride's flag, smitten, cleaved down to the staff."
3311,SNAP-DRAGON,
3312,SNAP-DRAGON,"She hid her face, she murmured between her lips"
3313,SNAP-DRAGON,"The low word 'Don't!' I let the flower fall,"
3314,SNAP-DRAGON,But held my hand afloat still towards the slips
3315,SNAP-DRAGON,"Of blossom she fingered, and my crisp fingers all"
3316,SNAP-DRAGON,"Put forth to her: she did not move, nor I,"
3317,SNAP-DRAGON,For my hand like a snake watched hers that could not fly.
3318,SNAP-DRAGON,"Then I laughed in the dark of my heart, I did exult"
3319,SNAP-DRAGON,Like a sudden chuckling of music: I bade her eyes
3320,SNAP-DRAGON,"Meet mine, I opened her helpless eyes to consult"
3321,SNAP-DRAGON,"Their fear, their shame, their joy that underlies"
3322,SNAP-DRAGON,Defeat in such a battle: in the dark of her eyes
3323,SNAP-DRAGON,My heart was fierce to make her laughter rise ...
3324,SNAP-DRAGON,"Till her dark deeps shook with convulsive thrills, and the dark"
3325,SNAP-DRAGON,"Of her spirit wavered like water thrilled with light,"
3326,SNAP-DRAGON,And my heart leaped up in longing to plunge its stark
3327,SNAP-DRAGON,Fervour within the pool of her twilight:
3328,SNAP-DRAGON,"Within her spacious gloom, in the mystery"
3329,SNAP-DRAGON,"Of her barbarous soul, to grope with ecstasy ..."
3330,SNAP-DRAGON,
3331,SNAP-DRAGON,And I do not care though the large hands of revenge
3332,SNAP-DRAGON,"Shall get my throat at last--shall get it soon,"
3333,SNAP-DRAGON,If the joy that they are lifted to avenge
3334,SNAP-DRAGON,"Have risen red on my night as a harvest moon,"
3335,SNAP-DRAGON,"Which even Death can only put out for me,"
3336,SNAP-DRAGON,And death I know is better than not-to-be.

3354,BIOGRAPHY,
3355,BIOGRAPHY,"When I am buried, all my thoughts and acts"
3356,BIOGRAPHY,"Will be reduced to lists of dates and facts,"
3357,BIOGRAPHY,And long before this wandering flesh is rotten
3358,BIOGRAPHY,The dates which made me will be all forgotten;
3359,BIOGRAPHY,And none will know the gleam there used to be
3360,BIOGRAPHY,"About the feast days freshly kept by me,"
3361,BIOGRAPHY,But men will call the golden hour of bliss
3362,BIOGRAPHY,"'About this time,' or 'shortly after this.'"
3363,BIOGRAPHY,
3364,BIOGRAPHY,Men do not heed the rungs by which men climb
3365,BIOGRAPHY,"Those glittering steps, those milestones upon time,"
3366,BIOGRAPHY,"Those tombstones of dead selves, those hours of birth,"
3367,BIOGRAPHY,Those moments of the soul in years of earth.
3368,BIOGRAPHY,"They mark the height achieved, the main result,"
3369,BIOGRAPHY,"The power of freedom in the perished cult,"
3370,BIOGRAPHY,The power of boredom in the dead man's deeds
3371,BIOGRAPHY,Not the bright moments of the sprinkled seeds.
3372,BIOGRAPHY,
3373,BIOGRAPHY,By many waters and on many ways
3374,BIOGRAPHY,I have known golden instants and bright days;
3375,BIOGRAPHY,"The day on which, beneath an arching sail,"
3376,BIOGRAPHY,I saw the Cordilleras and gave hail;
3377,BIOGRAPHY,The summer day on which in heart's delight
3378,BIOGRAPHY,"I saw the Swansea Mumbles bursting white,"
3379,BIOGRAPHY,The glittering day when all the waves wore flags
3380,BIOGRAPHY,And the ship Wanderer came with sails in rags;
3381,BIOGRAPHY,That curlew-calling time in Irish dusk
3382,BIOGRAPHY,"When life became more splendid than its husk,"
3383,BIOGRAPHY,When the rent chapel on the brae at Slains
3384,BIOGRAPHY,Shone with a doorway opening beyond brains;
3385,BIOGRAPHY,"The dawn when, with a brace-block's creaking cry,"
3386,BIOGRAPHY,"Out of the mist a little barque slipped by,"
3387,BIOGRAPHY,"Spilling the mist with changing gleams of red,"
3388,BIOGRAPHY,"Then gone, with one raised hand and one turned head;"
3389,BIOGRAPHY,The howling evening when the spindrift's mists
3390,BIOGRAPHY,"Broke to display the four Evangelists,"
3391,BIOGRAPHY,"Snow-capped, divinely granite, lashed by breakers,"
3392,BIOGRAPHY,Wind-beaten bones of long-since-buried acres;
3393,BIOGRAPHY,The night alone near water when I heard
3394,BIOGRAPHY,All the sea's spirit spoken by a bird;
3395,BIOGRAPHY,The English dusk when I beheld once more
3396,BIOGRAPHY,"(With eyes so changed) the ship, the citied shore,"
3397,BIOGRAPHY,"The lines of masts, the streets so cheerly trod"
3398,BIOGRAPHY,"In happier seasons, and gave thanks to God."
3399,BIOGRAPHY,"All had their beauty, their bright moments' gift,"
3400,BIOGRAPHY,"Their something caught from Time, the ever-swift."
3401,BIOGRAPHY,
3402,BIOGRAPHY,All of those gleams were golden; but life's hands
3403,BIOGRAPHY,Have given more constant gifts in changing lands;
3404,BIOGRAPHY,"And when I count those gifts, I think them such"
3405,BIOGRAPHY,As no man's bounty could have bettered much:
3406,BIOGRAPHY,"The gift of country life, near hills and woods"
3407,BIOGRAPHY,"Where happy waters sing in solitudes,"
3408,BIOGRAPHY,"The gift of being near ships, of seeing each day"
3409,BIOGRAPHY,"A city of ships with great ships under weigh,"
3410,BIOGRAPHY,"The great street paved with water, filled with shipping,"
3411,BIOGRAPHY,And all the world's flags flying and seagulls dipping.
3412,BIOGRAPHY,
3413,BIOGRAPHY,Yet when I am dust my penman may not know
3414,BIOGRAPHY,"Those water-trampling ships which made me glow,"
3415,BIOGRAPHY,"But think my wonder mad and fail to find,"
3416,BIOGRAPHY,"Their glory, even dimly, from my mind,"
3417,BIOGRAPHY,And yet they made me:
3418,BIOGRAPHY,not alone the ships
3419,BIOGRAPHY,"But men hard-palmed from tallying-on to whips,"
3420,BIOGRAPHY,The two close friends of nearly twenty years
3421,BIOGRAPHY,"Sea-followers both, sea-wrestlers and sea-peers,"
3422,BIOGRAPHY,Whose feet with mine wore many a bolthead bright
3423,BIOGRAPHY,Treading the decks beneath the riding light.
3424,BIOGRAPHY,"Yet death will make that warmth of friendship cold,"
3425,BIOGRAPHY,"And who'll know what one said and what one told,"
3426,BIOGRAPHY,"Our hearts' communion, and the broken spells"
3427,BIOGRAPHY,When the loud call blew at the strike of bells?
3428,BIOGRAPHY,"No one, I know, yet let me be believed--"
3429,BIOGRAPHY,A soul entirely known is life achieved.
3430,BIOGRAPHY,
3431,BIOGRAPHY,Years blank with hardship never speak a word
3432,BIOGRAPHY,Live in the soul to make the being stirred;
3433,BIOGRAPHY,Towns can be prisons where the spirit dulls
3434,BIOGRAPHY,"Away from mates and ocean-wandering hulls,"
3435,BIOGRAPHY,Away from all bright water and great hills
3436,BIOGRAPHY,And sheep-walks where the curlews cry their fills;
3437,BIOGRAPHY,"Away in towns, where eyes have nought to see"
3438,BIOGRAPHY,But dead museums and miles of misery
3439,BIOGRAPHY,And floating life un-rooted from man's need
3440,BIOGRAPHY,And miles of fish-hooks baited to catch greed
3441,BIOGRAPHY,And life made wretched out of human ken
3442,BIOGRAPHY,And miles of shopping women served by men.
3443,BIOGRAPHY,"So, if the penman sums my London days,"
3444,BIOGRAPHY,"Let him but say that there were holy ways,"
3445,BIOGRAPHY,Dull Bloomsbury streets of dull brick mansions old
3446,BIOGRAPHY,With stinking doors where women stood to scold
3447,BIOGRAPHY,And drunken waits at Christmas with their horn
3448,BIOGRAPHY,"Droning the news, in snow, that Christ was born;"
3449,BIOGRAPHY,And windy gas lamps and the wet roads shining
3450,BIOGRAPHY,"And that old carol of the midnight whining,"
3451,BIOGRAPHY,And that old room above the noisy slum
3452,BIOGRAPHY,Where there was wine and fire and talk with some
3453,BIOGRAPHY,Under strange pictures of the wakened soul
3454,BIOGRAPHY,To whom this earth was but a burnt-out coal.
3455,BIOGRAPHY,
3456,BIOGRAPHY,"O Time, bring back those midnights and those friends,"
3457,BIOGRAPHY,"Those glittering moments that a spirit lends,"
3458,BIOGRAPHY,"That all may be imagined from the flash,"
3459,BIOGRAPHY,The cloud-hid god-game through the lightning gash;
3460,BIOGRAPHY,Those hours of stricken sparks from which men took
3461,BIOGRAPHY,Light to send out to men in song or book;
3462,BIOGRAPHY,"Those friends who heard St. Pancras' bells strike two,"
3463,BIOGRAPHY,"Yet stayed until the barber's cockerel crew,"
3464,BIOGRAPHY,"Talking of noble styles, the Frenchman's best,"
3465,BIOGRAPHY,"The thought beyond great poets not expressed,"
3466,BIOGRAPHY,"The glory of mood where human frailty failed,"
3467,BIOGRAPHY,"The forts of human light not yet assailed,"
3468,BIOGRAPHY,"Till the dim room had mind and seemed to brood,"
3469,BIOGRAPHY,Binding our wills to mental brotherhood;
3470,BIOGRAPHY,"Till we became a college, and each night"
3471,BIOGRAPHY,Was discipline and manhood and delight;
3472,BIOGRAPHY,Till our farewells and winding down the stairs
3473,BIOGRAPHY,At each gray dawn had meaning that Time spares
3474,BIOGRAPHY,"That we, so linked, should roam the whole world round"
3475,BIOGRAPHY,"Teaching the ways our brooding minds had found,"
3476,BIOGRAPHY,"Making that room our Chapter, our one mind"
3477,BIOGRAPHY,Where all that this world soiled should be refined.
3478,BIOGRAPHY,
3479,BIOGRAPHY,Often at night I tread those streets again
3480,BIOGRAPHY,"And see the alleys glimmering in the rain,"
3481,BIOGRAPHY,"Yet now I miss that sign of earlier tramps,"
3482,BIOGRAPHY,"A house with shadows of plane-boughs under lamps,"
3483,BIOGRAPHY,"The secret house where once a beggar stood,"
3484,BIOGRAPHY,"Trembling and blind, to show his woe for food."
3485,BIOGRAPHY,And now I miss that friend who used to walk
3486,BIOGRAPHY,"Home to my lodgings with me, deep in talk,"
3487,BIOGRAPHY,Wearing the last of night out in still streets
3488,BIOGRAPHY,Trodden by us and policemen on their beats
3489,BIOGRAPHY,"And cats, but else deserted; now I miss"
3490,BIOGRAPHY,That lively mind and guttural laugh of his
3491,BIOGRAPHY,"And that strange way he had of making gleam,"
3492,BIOGRAPHY,"Like something real, the art we used to dream."
3493,BIOGRAPHY,London has been my prison; but my books
3494,BIOGRAPHY,"Hills and great waters, labouring men and brooks,"
3495,BIOGRAPHY,Ships and deep friendships and remembered days
3496,BIOGRAPHY,Which even now set all my mind ablaze--
3497,BIOGRAPHY,"As that June day when, in the red bricks' chinks"
3498,BIOGRAPHY,I saw the old Roman ruins white with pinks
3499,BIOGRAPHY,And felt the hillside haunted even then
3500,BIOGRAPHY,By not dead memory of the Roman men;
3501,BIOGRAPHY,And felt the hillside thronged by souls unseen
3502,BIOGRAPHY,"Who knew the interest in me, and were keen"
3503,BIOGRAPHY,That man alive should understand man dead
3504,BIOGRAPHY,"So many centuries since the blood was shed,"
3505,BIOGRAPHY,And quickened with strange hush because this comer
3506,BIOGRAPHY,Sensed a strange soul alive behind the summer.
3507,BIOGRAPHY,That other day on Ercall when the stones
3508,BIOGRAPHY,"Were sunbleached white, like long unburied bones,"
3509,BIOGRAPHY,While the bees droned and all the air was sweet
3510,BIOGRAPHY,"From honey buried underneath my feet,"
3511,BIOGRAPHY,Honey of purple heather and white clover
3512,BIOGRAPHY,Sealed in its gummy bags till summer's over.
3513,BIOGRAPHY,"Then other days by water, by bright sea,"
3514,BIOGRAPHY,"Clear as clean glass, and my bright friend with me;"
3515,BIOGRAPHY,The cove clean bottomed where we saw the brown
3516,BIOGRAPHY,"Red spotted plaice go skimming six feet down,"
3517,BIOGRAPHY,"And saw the long fronds waving, white with shells,"
3518,BIOGRAPHY,"Waving, unfolding, drooping, to the swells;"
3519,BIOGRAPHY,That sadder day when we beheld the great
3520,BIOGRAPHY,And terrible beauty of a Lammas spate
3521,BIOGRAPHY,"Roaring white-mouthed in all the great cliff's gaps,"
3522,BIOGRAPHY,"Headlong, tree-tumbling fury of collapse,"
3523,BIOGRAPHY,While drenching clouds drove by and every sense
3524,BIOGRAPHY,"Was water roaring or rushing or in offence,"
3525,BIOGRAPHY,And mountain sheep stood huddled and blown gaps gleamed
3526,BIOGRAPHY,Where torn white hair of torrents shook and streamed.
3527,BIOGRAPHY,That sadder day when we beheld again
3528,BIOGRAPHY,A spate going down in sunshine after rain
3529,BIOGRAPHY,When the blue reach of water leaping bright
3530,BIOGRAPHY,"Was one long ripple and clatter, flecked with white."
3531,BIOGRAPHY,"And that far day, that never blotted page"
3532,BIOGRAPHY,"When youth was bright like flowers about old age,"
3533,BIOGRAPHY,Fair generations bringing thanks for life
3534,BIOGRAPHY,To that old kindly man and trembling wife
3535,BIOGRAPHY,After their sixty years: Time never made
3536,BIOGRAPHY,"A better beauty since the Earth was laid,"
3537,BIOGRAPHY,Than that thanksgiving given to grey hair
3538,BIOGRAPHY,For the great gift of life which brought them there.
3539,BIOGRAPHY,
3540,BIOGRAPHY,Days of endeavour have been good: the days
3541,BIOGRAPHY,Racing in cutters for the comrade's praise.
3542,BIOGRAPHY,"The day they led my cutter at the turn,"
3543,BIOGRAPHY,"Yet could not keep the lead, and dropped astern;"
3544,BIOGRAPHY,The moment in the spurt when both boats' oars
3545,BIOGRAPHY,"Dipped in each other's wash, and throats grew hoarse,"
3546,BIOGRAPHY,"And teeth ground into teeth, and both strokes quickened"
3547,BIOGRAPHY,"Lashing the sea, and gasps came, and hearts sickened,"
3548,BIOGRAPHY,"And coxswains damned us, dancing, banking stroke,"
3549,BIOGRAPHY,"To put our weights on, though our hearts were broke,"
3550,BIOGRAPHY,"And both boats seemed to stick and sea seemed glue,"
3551,BIOGRAPHY,The tide a mill race we were struggling through;
3552,BIOGRAPHY,And every quick recover gave us squints
3553,BIOGRAPHY,"Of them still there, and oar-tossed water-glints,"
3554,BIOGRAPHY,"And cheering came, our friends, our foemen cheering,"
3555,BIOGRAPHY,"A long, wild, rallying murmur on the hearing,"
3556,BIOGRAPHY,"'Port Fore!' and 'Starboard Fore!' 'Port Fore' 'Port Fore,'"
3557,BIOGRAPHY,"'Up with her,' 'Starboard'; and at that each oar"
3558,BIOGRAPHY,"Lightened, though arms were bursting, and eyes shut,"
3559,BIOGRAPHY,"And the oak stretchers grunted in the strut,"
3560,BIOGRAPHY,"And the curse quickened from the cox, our bows"
3561,BIOGRAPHY,"Crashed, and drove talking water, we made vows,"
3562,BIOGRAPHY,Chastity vows and temperance; in our pain
3563,BIOGRAPHY,We numbered things we'd never eat again
3564,BIOGRAPHY,If we could only win; then came the yell
3565,BIOGRAPHY,"'Starboard,' 'Port Fore,' and then a beaten bell"
3566,BIOGRAPHY,"Rung as for fire to cheer us. 'Now.' Oars bent,"
3567,BIOGRAPHY,"Soul took the looms now body's bolt was spent,"
3568,BIOGRAPHY,"'Damn it, come on now.' 'On now,' 'On now,' 'Starboard.'"
3569,BIOGRAPHY,"'Port Fore,' 'Up with her, Port'; each cutter harboured"
3570,BIOGRAPHY,"Ten eye-shut painsick strugglers, 'Heave, oh heave,'"
3571,BIOGRAPHY,Catcalls waked echoes like a shrieking sheave.
3572,BIOGRAPHY,"'Heave,' and I saw a back, then two. 'Port Fore,'"
3573,BIOGRAPHY,"'Starboard,' 'Come on'; I saw the midship oar,"
3574,BIOGRAPHY,"And knew we had done them. 'Port Fore,' 'Starboard,' 'Now.'"
3575,BIOGRAPHY,"I saw bright water spurting at their bow,"
3576,BIOGRAPHY,Their cox' full face an instant. They were done.
3577,BIOGRAPHY,The watchers' cheering almost drowned the gun.
3578,BIOGRAPHY,We had hardly strength to toss our oars; our cry
3579,BIOGRAPHY,Cheering the losing cutter was a sigh.
3580,BIOGRAPHY,
3581,BIOGRAPHY,Other bright days of action have seemed great:
3582,BIOGRAPHY,Wild days in a pampero off the Plate;
3583,BIOGRAPHY,"Good swimming days, at Hog Back or the Coves"
3584,BIOGRAPHY,Which the young gannet and the corbie loves;
3585,BIOGRAPHY,"Surf-swimming between rollers, catching breath"
3586,BIOGRAPHY,"Between the advancing grave and breaking death,"
3587,BIOGRAPHY,Then shooting up into the sunbright smooth
3588,BIOGRAPHY,To watch the advancing roller bare her tooth;
3589,BIOGRAPHY,"And days of labour also, loading, hauling;"
3590,BIOGRAPHY,"Long days at winch or capstan, heaving, pawling;"
3591,BIOGRAPHY,"The days with oxen, dragging stone from blasting,"
3592,BIOGRAPHY,"And dusty days in mills, and hot days masting."
3593,BIOGRAPHY,"Trucking on dust-dry deckings smooth like ice,"
3594,BIOGRAPHY,And hunts in mighty wool-racks after mice;
3595,BIOGRAPHY,Mornings with buckwheat when the fields did blanch
3596,BIOGRAPHY,With White Leghorns come from the chicken ranch;
3597,BIOGRAPHY,"Days near the spring upon the sunburnt hill,"
3598,BIOGRAPHY,Plying the maul or gripping tight the drill;
3599,BIOGRAPHY,"Delights of work most real, delights that change"
3600,BIOGRAPHY,The headache life of towns to rapture strange
3601,BIOGRAPHY,"Not known by townsmen, nor imagined; health"
3602,BIOGRAPHY,That puts new glory upon mental wealth
3603,BIOGRAPHY,And makes the poor man rich.
3604,BIOGRAPHY,"But that ends, too."
3605,BIOGRAPHY,"Health, with its thoughts of life; and that bright view,"
3606,BIOGRAPHY,"That sunny landscape from life's peak, that glory,"
3607,BIOGRAPHY,"And all a glad man's comments on life's story,"
3608,BIOGRAPHY,"And thoughts of marvellous towns and living men,"
3609,BIOGRAPHY,"And what pens tell, and all beyond the pen,"
3610,BIOGRAPHY,"End, and are summed in words so truly dead"
3611,BIOGRAPHY,"They raise no image of the heart and head,"
3612,BIOGRAPHY,"The life, the man alive, the friend we knew,"
3613,BIOGRAPHY,"The minds ours argued with or listened to,"
3614,BIOGRAPHY,"None; but are dead, and all life's keenness, all,"
3615,BIOGRAPHY,Is dead as print before the funeral;
3616,BIOGRAPHY,"Even deader after, when the dates are sought,"
3617,BIOGRAPHY,And cold minds disagree with what we thought.
3618,BIOGRAPHY,
3619,BIOGRAPHY,This many-pictured world of many passions
3620,BIOGRAPHY,"Wears out the nations as a woman fashions,"
3621,BIOGRAPHY,And what life is is much to very few;
3622,BIOGRAPHY,"Men being so strange, so mad, and what men do"
3623,BIOGRAPHY,So good to watch or share; but when men count
3624,BIOGRAPHY,Those hours of life that were a bursting fount
3625,BIOGRAPHY,"Sparkling the dusty heart with living springs,"
3626,BIOGRAPHY,"There seems a world, beyond our earthly things,"
3627,BIOGRAPHY,"Gated by golden moments, each bright time"
3628,BIOGRAPHY,"Opening to show the city white like lime,"
3629,BIOGRAPHY,"High-towered and many-peopled. This made sure,"
3630,BIOGRAPHY,"Work that obscures those moments seems impure,"
3631,BIOGRAPHY,Making our not-returning time of breath
3632,BIOGRAPHY,"Dull with the ritual and records of death,"
3633,BIOGRAPHY,That frost of fact by which our wisdom gives
3634,BIOGRAPHY,Correctly stated death to all that lives.
3635,BIOGRAPHY,
3636,BIOGRAPHY,Best trust the happy moments. What they gave
3637,BIOGRAPHY,"Makes man less fearful of the certain grave,"
3638,BIOGRAPHY,And gives his work compassion and new eyes.
3639,BIOGRAPHY,The days that make us happy make us wise.

3656,CHILD OF DAWN,
3657,CHILD OF DAWN,
3658,CHILD OF DAWN,O gentle vision in the dawn:
3659,CHILD OF DAWN,My spirit over faint cool water glides.
3660,CHILD OF DAWN,"Child of the day,"
3661,CHILD OF DAWN,To thee;
3662,CHILD OF DAWN,And thou art drawn
3663,CHILD OF DAWN,By kindred impulse over silver tides
3664,CHILD OF DAWN,The dreamy way
3665,CHILD OF DAWN,To me.
3666,CHILD OF DAWN,
3667,CHILD OF DAWN,"I need thy hands, O gentle wonder-child,"
3668,CHILD OF DAWN,For they are moulded unto all repose;
3669,CHILD OF DAWN,"Thy lips are frail,"
3670,CHILD OF DAWN,And thou art cooler than an April rose;
3671,CHILD OF DAWN,White are thy words and mild:
3672,CHILD OF DAWN,"Child of the morning, hail!"
3673,CHILD OF DAWN,
3674,CHILD OF DAWN,Breathe thus upon mine eyelids--that we twain
3675,CHILD OF DAWN,May build the day together out of dreams.
3676,CHILD OF DAWN,"Life, with thy breath upon my eyelids, seems"
3677,CHILD OF DAWN,Exquisite to the utmost bounds of pain.
3678,CHILD OF DAWN,"I cannot live, except as I may be"
3679,CHILD OF DAWN,Compelled for love of thee.
3680,CHILD OF DAWN,"O let us drift,"
3681,CHILD OF DAWN,"Frail as the floating silver of a star,"
3682,CHILD OF DAWN,"Or like the summer humming of a bee,"
3683,CHILD OF DAWN,Or stream-reflected sunlight through a rift.
3684,CHILD OF DAWN,
3685,CHILD OF DAWN,"I will not hope, because I know, alas,"
3686,CHILD OF DAWN,"Morning will glide, and noon, and then the night"
3687,CHILD OF DAWN,Will take thee from me. Everything must pass
3688,CHILD OF DAWN,Swiftly--but nought so swift as dawn-delight.
3689,CHILD OF DAWN,"If I could hold thee till the day,"
3690,CHILD OF DAWN,"Is broad on sea and hill,"
3691,CHILD OF DAWN,"Child of repose,"
3692,CHILD OF DAWN,"What god can say,"
3693,CHILD OF DAWN,"What god or mortal knows,"
3694,CHILD OF DAWN,What dream thou mightest not in me fulfil?
3695,CHILD OF DAWN,
3696,CHILD OF DAWN,O gentle vision in the dawn:
3697,CHILD OF DAWN,"My spirit over faint cool water glides,"
3698,CHILD OF DAWN,"Child of the day,"
3699,CHILD OF DAWN,To thee;
3700,CHILD OF DAWN,And thou art drawn
3701,CHILD OF DAWN,By kindred impulse over silver tides
3702,CHILD OF DAWN,The dreamy way
3703,CHILD OF DAWN,To me.

3708,LAKE LEMAN,
3709,LAKE LEMAN,
3710,LAKE LEMAN,It is the sacred hour: above the far
3711,LAKE LEMAN,"Low emerald hills that northward fold,"
3712,LAKE LEMAN,"Calmly, upon the blue the evening star"
3713,LAKE LEMAN,"Floats, wreathed in dusky gold."
3714,LAKE LEMAN,The winds have sung all day; but now they lie
3715,LAKE LEMAN,"Faint, sleeping; and the evening sounds awake."
3716,LAKE LEMAN,The slow bell tolls across the water: I
3717,LAKE LEMAN,Am haunted by the spirit of the lake.
3718,LAKE LEMAN,It seems as though the sounding of the bell
3719,LAKE LEMAN,"Intoned the low song of the water-soul,"
3720,LAKE LEMAN,And at some moments I can hardly tell
3721,LAKE LEMAN,The long-resounding echo from the toll.
3722,LAKE LEMAN,"O thou mysterious lake, thy spell"
3723,LAKE LEMAN,Holds all who round thy fruitful margin dwell.
3724,LAKE LEMAN,Oft have I seen home-going peasants' eyes
3725,LAKE LEMAN,Lit with the peace that emanates from thee.
3726,LAKE LEMAN,"Those who among thy waters plunge, arise"
3727,LAKE LEMAN,Filled with new wisdom and serenity.
3728,LAKE LEMAN,"Thy veins are in the mountains. I have heard,"
3729,LAKE LEMAN,"Down-stretched beside thee at the silent noon,"
3730,LAKE LEMAN,"With leaning head attentive to thy word,"
3731,LAKE LEMAN,"A secret and delicious mountain-tune,"
3732,LAKE LEMAN,Proceeding as from many shadowed hours
3733,LAKE LEMAN,"In ancient forests carpeted with flowers,"
3734,LAKE LEMAN,"Or far, where hidden waters, wandering"
3735,LAKE LEMAN,"Through banks of snow, trickle, and meet, and sing."
3736,LAKE LEMAN,"Ah, what repose at noon to go,"
3737,LAKE LEMAN,"Lean on thy bosom, hold thee with wide hands,"
3738,LAKE LEMAN,And listen for the music of the snow!
3739,LAKE LEMAN,"But most, as now,"
3740,LAKE LEMAN,"When harvest covers thy surrounding lands,"
3741,LAKE LEMAN,"I love thee, with a coronal of sheaves"
3742,LAKE LEMAN,Crowned regent of the day;
3743,LAKE LEMAN,And on the air thy placid breathing leaves
3744,LAKE LEMAN,A scent of corn and hay.
3745,LAKE LEMAN,For thou hast gathered (as a mother will
3746,LAKE LEMAN,The sayings of her children in her heart)
3747,LAKE LEMAN,"The harvest-thoughts of reapers on the hill,"
3748,LAKE LEMAN,When the cool rose and honeysuckle fill
3749,LAKE LEMAN,"The air, and fruit is laden on the cart."
3750,LAKE LEMAN,Thou breathest the delight
3751,LAKE LEMAN,"Of summer evening at the deep-roofed farm,"
3752,LAKE LEMAN,"And meditation of the summer night,"
3753,LAKE LEMAN,When the enravished earth is lying warm
3754,LAKE LEMAN,From recent kisses of the conquering sun.
3755,LAKE LEMAN,
3756,LAKE LEMAN,"Dwell as a spirit in me, O thou one"
3757,LAKE LEMAN,Sweet natural presence. In the years to be
3758,LAKE LEMAN,"When all the mortal loves perchance are done,"
3759,LAKE LEMAN,"Them I will bid farewell, but, oh, not thee."
3760,LAKE LEMAN,"I love thee. When the youthful visions fade,"
3761,LAKE LEMAN,Fade thou not also in the hopeless past.
3762,LAKE LEMAN,"Be constant and delightful, as a maid"
3763,LAKE LEMAN,"Sought over all the world, and found at last."

3782,(FIRST SCENE),(FIRST SCENE)
3783,(FIRST SCENE),
3784,(FIRST SCENE),
3785,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
3786,(FIRST SCENE),
3787,(FIRST SCENE),"I thank thee, no;"
3788,(FIRST SCENE),Already have I drunk a bowl of wine ...
3789,(FIRST SCENE),"Nay, nay, why wouldst thou rise?"
3790,(FIRST SCENE),There rolls thy ball of worsted! Sit thee down;
3791,(FIRST SCENE),"Come, sit thee down, Cydilla,"
3792,(FIRST SCENE),"And let me fetch thy ball, rewind the wool,"
3793,(FIRST SCENE),And tell thee all that happened yesterday.
3794,(FIRST SCENE),
3795,(FIRST SCENE),
3796,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
3797,(FIRST SCENE),
3798,(FIRST SCENE),"Thanks, Damon; now, by Zeus, thou art so brisk,"
3799,(FIRST SCENE),It shames me that to stoop should try my bones.
3800,(FIRST SCENE),
3801,(FIRST SCENE),
3802,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
3803,(FIRST SCENE),
3804,(FIRST SCENE),"We both are old,"
3805,(FIRST SCENE),And if we may have peaceful days are blessed;
3806,(FIRST SCENE),Few hours of buoyancy will come to break
3807,(FIRST SCENE),The sure withdrawal from us of life's flood.
3808,(FIRST SCENE),
3809,(FIRST SCENE),
3810,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
3811,(FIRST SCENE),
3812,(FIRST SCENE),"True, true, youth looks a great way off! To think"
3813,(FIRST SCENE),It once was age did lie quite out of sight!
3814,(FIRST SCENE),
3815,(FIRST SCENE),
3816,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
3817,(FIRST SCENE),
3818,(FIRST SCENE),Not many days have been so beautiful
3819,(FIRST SCENE),"As yesterday, Cydilla; yet one was;"
3820,(FIRST SCENE),And I with thee broke tranced on its fine spell;
3821,(FIRST SCENE),"Thou dost remember? yes? but not with tears,"
3822,(FIRST SCENE),"Ah, not with tears, Cydilla, pray, oh, pray!"
3823,(FIRST SCENE),
3824,(FIRST SCENE),
3825,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
3826,(FIRST SCENE),
3827,(FIRST SCENE),"Pardon me, Damon,"
3828,(FIRST SCENE),'Tis many years since thou hast touched thereon;
3829,(FIRST SCENE),And something stirs about thee--
3830,(FIRST SCENE),Such air of eagerness as was thine when
3831,(FIRST SCENE),"I was more foolish than in my life, I hope"
3832,(FIRST SCENE),To ever have been at another time.
3833,(FIRST SCENE),
3834,(FIRST SCENE),
3835,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
3836,(FIRST SCENE),
3837,(FIRST SCENE),Pooh! foolish?--thou wast then so very wise
3838,(FIRST SCENE),"That, often having seen thee foolish since,"
3839,(FIRST SCENE),Wonder has made me faint that thou shouldst err.
3840,(FIRST SCENE),
3841,(FIRST SCENE),
3842,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
3843,(FIRST SCENE),
3844,(FIRST SCENE),"Nay, then I erred, dear Damon; and remorse"
3845,(FIRST SCENE),Was not so slow to find me as thou deemst.
3846,(FIRST SCENE),
3847,(FIRST SCENE),
3848,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
3849,(FIRST SCENE),
3850,(FIRST SCENE),"There, mop those dear wet eyes, or thou'lt ne'er hear"
3851,(FIRST SCENE),What it was filled my heart full yesterday.
3852,(FIRST SCENE),
3853,(FIRST SCENE),
3854,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
3855,(FIRST SCENE),
3856,(FIRST SCENE),"Tell, Damon; since I well know that regrets"
3857,(FIRST SCENE),Hang like dull gossips round another's ear.
3858,(FIRST SCENE),
3859,(FIRST SCENE),
3860,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
3861,(FIRST SCENE),
3862,(FIRST SCENE),"First, thou must know that oftentimes I rise,--"
3863,(FIRST SCENE),"Not heeding or not finding sleep, of watching"
3864,(FIRST SCENE),"Afraid no longer to be prodigal,--"
3865,(FIRST SCENE),And gaze upon the beauty of the night.
3866,(FIRST SCENE),"Quiet hours, while dawn absorbs the waning stars,"
3867,(FIRST SCENE),Are like cold water sipped between our cups
3868,(FIRST SCENE),Washing the jaded palate till it taste
3869,(FIRST SCENE),"The wine again. Ere the sun rose, I sat"
3870,(FIRST SCENE),Within my garden porch; my lamp was left
3871,(FIRST SCENE),"Burning beside my bed, though it would be"
3872,(FIRST SCENE),Broad day before I should return upstairs.
3873,(FIRST SCENE),"I let it burn, willing to waste some oil"
3874,(FIRST SCENE),Rather than to disturb my tranquil mood;
3875,(FIRST SCENE),"But, as the Fates determined, it was seen.--"
3876,(FIRST SCENE),"Suddenly, running round the dovecote, came"
3877,(FIRST SCENE),"A young man naked, breathless, through the dawn,"
3878,(FIRST SCENE),Florid with haste and wine; it was Hipparchus.
3879,(FIRST SCENE),"Yes, there he stood before me panting, rubbing"
3880,(FIRST SCENE),His heated flesh which felt the cold at once.
3881,(FIRST SCENE),When he had breath enough he begged me straight
3882,(FIRST SCENE),To put the lamp out; and himself had done it
3883,(FIRST SCENE),Ere I was on the stair.
3884,(FIRST SCENE),"Flung all along my bed, his gasping shook it"
3885,(FIRST SCENE),When I at length could sit down by his side:
3886,(FIRST SCENE),"'What cause, young sir, brings you here in this plight"
3887,(FIRST SCENE),"At such an hour?' He shuddered, sighed and rolled"
3888,(FIRST SCENE),My blanket round him; then came a gush of words:
3889,(FIRST SCENE),"'The first of causes, Damon, namely Love,"
3890,(FIRST SCENE),Eldest and least resigned and most unblushing
3891,(FIRST SCENE),Of all the turbulent impulsive gods.
3892,(FIRST SCENE),A quarter of an hour scarce has flown
3893,(FIRST SCENE),"Since lovely arms clung round me, and my head"
3894,(FIRST SCENE),Asleep lay nested in a woman's hair;
3895,(FIRST SCENE),My cheek still bears print of its ample coils.'
3896,(FIRST SCENE),Athwart its burning flush he drew my fingers
3897,(FIRST SCENE),And their tips felt it might be as he said.
3898,(FIRST SCENE),"'Oh I have had a night, a night, a night!"
3899,(FIRST SCENE),Had Paris so much bliss?
3900,(FIRST SCENE),And oh! was Helen's kiss
3901,(FIRST SCENE),To be compared with those I tasted?
3902,(FIRST SCENE),Which but for me had all been wasted
3903,(FIRST SCENE),"On a bald man, a fat man, a gross man, a beast"
3904,(FIRST SCENE),To scare the best guest from the very best feast!'
3905,(FIRST SCENE),"Cydilla need not hear half that he said,"
3906,(FIRST SCENE),For he was mad awhile.
3907,(FIRST SCENE),"But having given rein to hot caprice,"
3908,(FIRST SCENE),"And satyr jest, and the distempered male,"
3909,(FIRST SCENE),"At length, I heard his story."
3910,(FIRST SCENE),At sun-down certain miles without the town.
3911,(FIRST SCENE),"He'd chanced upon a light-wheeled litter-car,"
3912,(FIRST SCENE),And in it there stood one
3913,(FIRST SCENE),"Yet more a woman than her garb was rich,"
3914,(FIRST SCENE),With more of youth and health than elegance.
3915,(FIRST SCENE),"'The mules,' he said, 'were beauties: she was one,"
3916,(FIRST SCENE),And cried directions to the neighbour field:
3917,(FIRST SCENE),"""O catch that big bough! Fool, not that, the next!"
3918,(FIRST SCENE),"Clumsy, you've let it go! O stop it swaying,"
3919,(FIRST SCENE),"The eggs will jolt out!"" From the road,' said he,"
3920,(FIRST SCENE),'I could not see who thus was rated; so
3921,(FIRST SCENE),"Sprang up beside her and beheld her husband,"
3922,(FIRST SCENE),"Lover or keeper, what you like to call him;--"
3923,(FIRST SCENE),A middle-aged stout man upon whose shoulders
3924,(FIRST SCENE),"Kneeled up a scraggy mule-boy slave, who was"
3925,(FIRST SCENE),The fool that could not reach a thrush's nest
3926,(FIRST SCENE),"Which they, while plucking almond, had revealed."
3927,(FIRST SCENE),"Before she knew who it could be, I said"
3928,(FIRST SCENE),"""Why yes, he is a fool, but we, fair friend,"
3929,(FIRST SCENE),Were we not foolish waiting for such fools?
3930,(FIRST SCENE),"Let us be off!"" I stooped, took, shook the reins"
3931,(FIRST SCENE),"With one hand, while the other clasped her waist."
3932,(FIRST SCENE),"""Ah, who?"" she turned; I smiled like amorous Zeus;"
3933,(FIRST SCENE),A certain vagueness clouded her wild eyes
3934,(FIRST SCENE),"As though she saw a swan, a bull, a shower"
3935,(FIRST SCENE),"Of hurried flames, and felt divinely pleased."
3936,(FIRST SCENE),I cracked the whip and we were jolted down;
3937,(FIRST SCENE),A kiss was snatched getting the ribbons straight;
3938,(FIRST SCENE),"We hardly heard them first begin to bawl,"
3939,(FIRST SCENE),So great our expedition towards the town:
3940,(FIRST SCENE),"We flew. I pulled up at an inn, then bid them"
3941,(FIRST SCENE),Stable my mules and chariot and prepare
3942,(FIRST SCENE),A meal for Dives; meanwhile we would stroll
3943,(FIRST SCENE),"Down to the market. Took her arm in mine,"
3944,(FIRST SCENE),"And, out of sight, hurried her through cross-lanes,"
3945,(FIRST SCENE),"Bade her choose, now at a fruit, now pastry booth."
3946,(FIRST SCENE),Until we gained my lodging she spoke little
3947,(FIRST SCENE),"But often laughed, tittering from time to time,"
3948,(FIRST SCENE),"""O Bacchus, what a prank!--Just think of Cymon,"
3949,(FIRST SCENE),"So stout as he is, at least five miles to walk"
3950,(FIRST SCENE),"Without a carriage!--well you take things coolly""--"
3951,(FIRST SCENE),Or such appreciation nice of gifts
3952,(FIRST SCENE),"I need not boast of, since I had them gratis."
3953,(FIRST SCENE),When my stiff door creaked open grudgingly
3954,(FIRST SCENE),Her face first fell; the room looked bare enough.
3955,(FIRST SCENE),Still we brought with us food and cakes; I owned
3956,(FIRST SCENE),A little cellar of delicious wine;
3957,(FIRST SCENE),An unasked neighbour's garden furnished flowers;
3958,(FIRST SCENE),"Jests helped me nimbly, I surpassed myself;"
3959,(FIRST SCENE),"So we were friends and, having laughed, we drank,"
3960,(FIRST SCENE),"Ate, sang, danced, grew wild. Soon both had one"
3961,(FIRST SCENE),"Desire, effort, goal,"
3962,(FIRST SCENE),"One bed, one sleep, one dream ..."
3963,(FIRST SCENE),"O Damon, Damon, both had one alarm,"
3964,(FIRST SCENE),"When woken by the door forced rudely open,"
3965,(FIRST SCENE),"Lit from the stair, bedazzled, glowered at, hated!"
3966,(FIRST SCENE),"She clung to me; her master, husband, uncle"
3967,(FIRST SCENE),(I know not which or what he was) stood there;
3968,(FIRST SCENE),It crossed my mind he might have been her father.
3969,(FIRST SCENE),"Naked, unarmed, I rose, and did assume"
3970,(FIRST SCENE),"What dignity is not derived from clothes,"
3971,(FIRST SCENE),"Bid them to quit my room, my private dwelling."
3972,(FIRST SCENE),"It was no use, for that gross beast was rich;"
3973,(FIRST SCENE),"Had his been neither legal right nor moral,"
3974,(FIRST SCENE),"My natural right was nought, for his she was"
3975,(FIRST SCENE),In eyes of those bribed catchpolls. Brute revenge
3976,(FIRST SCENE),"Seethed in his pimpled face: ""To gaol with him!"""
3977,(FIRST SCENE),He shouted huskily. I wrapped some clothes
3978,(FIRST SCENE),"About my shuddering bed-fellow, a sheet"
3979,(FIRST SCENE),"Flung round myself; ere she was led away,"
3980,(FIRST SCENE),"Had whispered to her ""Shriek, faint on the stairs!"""
3981,(FIRST SCENE),Then I was seized by two dog officers.
3982,(FIRST SCENE),"That girl was worth her keep, for, going down,"
3983,(FIRST SCENE),"She suddenly writhed, gasped, and had a fit."
3984,(FIRST SCENE),"My chance occurred, and I whipped through the casement;"
3985,(FIRST SCENE),All they could do was catch away the sheet;
3986,(FIRST SCENE),"I dropped a dozen feet into a bush,"
3987,(FIRST SCENE),Soon found my heels and plied them; here I am.'
3988,(FIRST SCENE),
3989,(FIRST SCENE),
3990,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
3991,(FIRST SCENE),
3992,(FIRST SCENE),"A strange tale, Damon, this to tell to me"
3993,(FIRST SCENE),And introduce as thou at first began.
3994,(FIRST SCENE),
3995,(FIRST SCENE),
3996,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
3997,(FIRST SCENE),
3998,(FIRST SCENE),"Thy life, Cydilla, has at all times been"
3999,(FIRST SCENE),A ceremony: this young man's
4000,(FIRST SCENE),"Discovered by free impulse, not couched in forms"
4001,(FIRST SCENE),Worn and made smooth by prudent folk long dead.
4002,(FIRST SCENE),I love Hipparchus for his wave-like brightness;
4003,(FIRST SCENE),"He wastes himself, but till his flash is gone"
4004,(FIRST SCENE),I shall be ever glad to hear him laugh:
4005,(FIRST SCENE),Nor could one make a Spartan of him even
4006,(FIRST SCENE),Were one the Spartan with a will to do it.
4007,(FIRST SCENE),"Yet had there been no more than what is told,"
4008,(FIRST SCENE),Thou wouldst not now be lending ear to me.
4009,(FIRST SCENE),
4010,(FIRST SCENE),
4011,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
4012,(FIRST SCENE),
4013,(FIRST SCENE),"Hearing such things, I think of my poor son,"
4014,(FIRST SCENE),Which makes me far too sad to smile at folly.
4015,(FIRST SCENE),
4016,(FIRST SCENE),
4017,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
4018,(FIRST SCENE),
4019,(FIRST SCENE),"There, let me tell thee all just as it happened,"
4020,(FIRST SCENE),And of thy son I shall be speaking soon.
4021,(FIRST SCENE),
4022,(FIRST SCENE),
4023,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
4024,(FIRST SCENE),
4025,(FIRST SCENE),"Delphis! Alas, are his companions still"
4026,(FIRST SCENE),No better than such ne'er-do-wells? I thought
4027,(FIRST SCENE),"His life was sager now, though he has killed"
4028,(FIRST SCENE),My hopes of seeing him a councillor.
4029,(FIRST SCENE),
4030,(FIRST SCENE),
4031,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
4032,(FIRST SCENE),
4033,(FIRST SCENE),How thou art quick to lay claim to a sorrow!
4034,(FIRST SCENE),Should I have come so eagerly to thee
4035,(FIRST SCENE),If all there was to tell thee were such poor news?
4036,(FIRST SCENE),
4037,(FIRST SCENE),
4038,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
4039,(FIRST SCENE),
4040,(FIRST SCENE),Forgive me; well know I there is no end
4041,(FIRST SCENE),To Damon's kindness; my poor boy has proved it;
4042,(FIRST SCENE),Could but his father so have understood him!
4043,(FIRST SCENE),
4044,(FIRST SCENE),
4045,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
4046,(FIRST SCENE),
4047,(FIRST SCENE),Let lie the sad contents of vanished years;
4048,(FIRST SCENE),Why with complaints reproach the helpless dead?
4049,(FIRST SCENE),Thy husband ne'er will cross thy hopes again.
4050,(FIRST SCENE),"Come, think of what a sky made yesterday"
4051,(FIRST SCENE),The worthy dream of thrice divine Apollo!
4052,(FIRST SCENE),"Hipparchus' plan was, we should take the road"
4053,(FIRST SCENE),"(As, when such mornings tempt me, is my wont)"
4054,(FIRST SCENE),"And cross the hills, along the coast, toward Mylae."
4055,(FIRST SCENE),"He in disguise, a younger handier Chloe,"
4056,(FIRST SCENE),Would lead my mule; must brown his face and arms:
4057,(FIRST SCENE),And thereon straight to wake her he was gone.
4058,(FIRST SCENE),Their voices from her cabin crossed the yard;
4059,(FIRST SCENE),He swears those parts of her are still well made
4060,(FIRST SCENE),Which she keeps too well hidden when about;--
4061,(FIRST SCENE),"And she, no little pleased; that interlards,"
4062,(FIRST SCENE),"Between her exclamations at his figure,"
4063,(FIRST SCENE),Reproof of gallantries half-laughed at hers.
4064,(FIRST SCENE),Anon she titters as he dons her dress
4065,(FIRST SCENE),Doubtless with pantomime--
4066,(FIRST SCENE),Head-carriage and hip-swagger.
4067,(FIRST SCENE),"A wench, more conscious of her sex than grace,"
4068,(FIRST SCENE),"He then rejoined me, changed beyond belief,"
4069,(FIRST SCENE),Roguish as vintage makes them; bustling helps
4070,(FIRST SCENE),Or hinders Chloe harness to the mule;--
4071,(FIRST SCENE),In fine bewitching both her age and mine.
4072,(FIRST SCENE),The life that in such fellows runs to waste
4073,(FIRST SCENE),Is like a gust that pulls about spring trees
4074,(FIRST SCENE),"And spoils your hope of fruit, while it delights"
4075,(FIRST SCENE),"The sense with bloom and odour scattered, mingled"
4076,(FIRST SCENE),With salt spume savours from a crested offing.
4077,(FIRST SCENE),The sun was not long up when we set forth
4078,(FIRST SCENE),"And, coming to the deeply shadowed gate,"
4079,(FIRST SCENE),"Found catchpolls lurked there, true to his surmise."
4080,(FIRST SCENE),"Them he, his beard disguised like face-ache, sauced;"
4081,(FIRST SCENE),"(Too gaily for that bandaged cheek, thought I);"
4082,(FIRST SCENE),"But they, whose business was to think,"
4083,(FIRST SCENE),"Were quite contented, let the hussy pass,"
4084,(FIRST SCENE),"Returned her kisses blown back down the road,"
4085,(FIRST SCENE),And crowned the mirth of their outwitter's heart.
4086,(FIRST SCENE),"As the steep road wound clear above the town,"
4087,(FIRST SCENE),Fewer became those little comedies
4088,(FIRST SCENE),"To which encounters roused him: till, at last,"
4089,(FIRST SCENE),He scarcely knew we passed some vine-dressers:
4090,(FIRST SCENE),"And I could see the sun's heat, lack of sleep,"
4091,(FIRST SCENE),And his late orgy would defeat his powers.
4092,(FIRST SCENE),"So, where the road grows level and must soon"
4093,(FIRST SCENE),"Descend, I bade him climb into the car;"
4094,(FIRST SCENE),On which the mule went slower still and slower.
4095,(FIRST SCENE),"This creature who, upon occasions, shows"
4096,(FIRST SCENE),"Taste very like her master's, left the highway"
4097,(FIRST SCENE),And took a grass-grown wheel-track that led down
4098,(FIRST SCENE),Zigzag athwart the broad curved banks of lawn
4099,(FIRST SCENE),Coating a valley between rounded hills
4100,(FIRST SCENE),Which faced the sea abruptly in huge crags.
4101,(FIRST SCENE),Each slope grew steeper till I left my seat
4102,(FIRST SCENE),And led the mule; for now Hipparchus' snore
4103,(FIRST SCENE),Tuned with the crooning waves heard from below.
4104,(FIRST SCENE),We passed two narrow belts of wood and then
4105,(FIRST SCENE),"The sea, that first showed blue above their tops,"
4106,(FIRST SCENE),Was spread before us chequered with white waves
4107,(FIRST SCENE),Breaking beneath on boulders which choked up
4108,(FIRST SCENE),The narrowed issue seawards of the glen.
4109,(FIRST SCENE),The steep path would no more admit of wheels:
4110,(FIRST SCENE),I took the beast and tethered her to graze
4111,(FIRST SCENE),"Within the shade of a stunt ilex clump,--"
4112,(FIRST SCENE),"Returned to find a vacant car; Hipparchus,"
4113,(FIRST SCENE),"Uneasy on my tilting down the shafts,"
4114,(FIRST SCENE),"And heated with strange clothes, had roused himself"
4115,(FIRST SCENE),"And lay asleep upon his late disguise,"
4116,(FIRST SCENE),Naked 'neath the cool eaves of one huge rock
4117,(FIRST SCENE),"That stood alone, much higher up than those"
4118,(FIRST SCENE),"Over, and through, and under which, the waves"
4119,(FIRST SCENE),Made music or forced milk-white floods of foam.
4120,(FIRST SCENE),"There I reclined, while vision, sound and scent"
4121,(FIRST SCENE),"Won on my willing soul like sleep on joy,"
4122,(FIRST SCENE),Till all accustomed thoughts were far away
4123,(FIRST SCENE),As from a happy child the cares of men.
4124,(FIRST SCENE),The hour was sacred to those earlier gods
4125,(FIRST SCENE),"Who are not active, but divinely wait"
4126,(FIRST SCENE),"The consummation of their first great deeds,"
4127,(FIRST SCENE),Unfolding still and blessing hours serene.
4128,(FIRST SCENE),"Presently I was gazing on a boy,"
4129,(FIRST SCENE),(Though whence he came my mind had not perceived).
4130,(FIRST SCENE),"Twelve or thirteen he seemed, with clinging feet"
4131,(FIRST SCENE),"Poised on a boulder, and against the sea"
4132,(FIRST SCENE),Set off. His wide-brimmed hat of straw was arched
4133,(FIRST SCENE),Over his massed black and abundant curls
4134,(FIRST SCENE),By orange ribbon tied beneath his chin;
4135,(FIRST SCENE),"Around his arms and shoulders his sole dress,"
4136,(FIRST SCENE),"A cloak, was all bunched up. He leapt, and lighted"
4137,(FIRST SCENE),"Upon the boulder just beneath; there swayed,"
4138,(FIRST SCENE),"Re-poised,"
4139,(FIRST SCENE),"And perked his head like an inquisitive bird,"
4140,(FIRST SCENE),As gravely happy; of all unconscious save
4141,(FIRST SCENE),His body's aptness for its then employment;
4142,(FIRST SCENE),His eyes intent on shells in some clear pool
4143,(FIRST SCENE),Or choosing where he next will plant his feet.
4144,(FIRST SCENE),"Again he leaps, his curls against his hat"
4145,(FIRST SCENE),"Bounce up behind. The daintiest thing alive,"
4146,(FIRST SCENE),"He rocks awhile, turned from me towards the sea;"
4147,(FIRST SCENE),Unseen I might devour him with my eyes.
4148,(FIRST SCENE),At last he stood upon a ledge each wave
4149,(FIRST SCENE),Spread with a sheet of foam four inches deep;
4150,(FIRST SCENE),He gazing at them saw them disappear
4151,(FIRST SCENE),And reappear all shining and refreshed:
4152,(FIRST SCENE),"Then raised his head, beheld the ocean stretched"
4153,(FIRST SCENE),Alive before him in its magnitude.
4154,(FIRST SCENE),None but a child could have been so absorbed
4155,(FIRST SCENE),"As to escape its spell till then, none else"
4156,(FIRST SCENE),Could so have voiced glad wonder in a song:--
4157,(FIRST SCENE),All the waves of the sea are there!
4158,(FIRST SCENE),In at my eyes they crush.
4159,(FIRST SCENE),Till my head holds as fair a sea:
4160,(FIRST SCENE),"Though I shut my eyes, they are there!"
4161,(FIRST SCENE),"Now towards my lids they rush,"
4162,(FIRST SCENE),Mad to burst forth from me
4163,(FIRST SCENE),Back to the open air!--
4164,(FIRST SCENE),"To follow them my heart needs,"
4165,(FIRST SCENE),"O white-maned steeds, to ride you;"
4166,(FIRST SCENE),"Lithe-shouldered steeds,"
4167,(FIRST SCENE),To the western isles astride you
4168,(FIRST SCENE),Amyntas speeds!'
4169,(FIRST SCENE),'Damon!' said a voice quite close to me
4170,(FIRST SCENE),And looking up ... as might have stood Apollo
4171,(FIRST SCENE),In one vast garment such as shepherds wear
4172,(FIRST SCENE),"And leaning on such tall staff stood ... Thou guessest,"
4173,(FIRST SCENE),Whose majesty as vainly was disguised
4174,(FIRST SCENE),As must have been Apollo's minding sheep.
4175,(FIRST SCENE),
4176,(FIRST SCENE),
4177,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
4178,(FIRST SCENE),
4179,(FIRST SCENE),"Delphis! I know, dear Damon, it was Delphis!"
4180,(FIRST SCENE),Healthy life in the country having chased
4181,(FIRST SCENE),"His haggard looks; his speech is not wild now,"
4182,(FIRST SCENE),Nor wicked with exceptions to things honest:
4183,(FIRST SCENE),Thy face a kindlier way than speech tells this.
4184,(FIRST SCENE),
4185,(FIRST SCENE),
4186,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
4187,(FIRST SCENE),
4188,(FIRST SCENE),"Yea, dear Cydilla, he was altogether"
4189,(FIRST SCENE),What mountaineers might dream of for a king.
4190,(FIRST SCENE),
4191,(FIRST SCENE),
4192,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
4193,(FIRST SCENE),
4194,(FIRST SCENE),"But tell me, is he tutor to that boy?"
4195,(FIRST SCENE),
4196,(FIRST SCENE),
4197,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
4198,(FIRST SCENE),
4199,(FIRST SCENE),He is an elder brother to the lad.
4200,(FIRST SCENE),
4201,(FIRST SCENE),
4202,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
4203,(FIRST SCENE),
4204,(FIRST SCENE),"Nay, nay, hide nothing, speak the worst at once."
4205,(FIRST SCENE),
4206,(FIRST SCENE),
4207,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
4208,(FIRST SCENE),
4209,(FIRST SCENE),I meant no hint of ill;
4210,(FIRST SCENE),A god in love with young Amyntas might
4211,(FIRST SCENE),Look as he did; fathers alone feel like him:
4212,(FIRST SCENE),Could I convey his calm and happy speech
4213,(FIRST SCENE),Thy last suspicion would be laid to rest.
4214,(FIRST SCENE),
4215,(FIRST SCENE),
4216,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
4217,(FIRST SCENE),
4218,(FIRST SCENE),"Damon, see, my glad tears have drowned all fear;"
4219,(FIRST SCENE),"Think'st thou he may come back and win renown,"
4220,(FIRST SCENE),And fill his father's place?
4221,(FIRST SCENE),"Not as his father filled it,"
4222,(FIRST SCENE),But with an inward spirit correspondent
4223,(FIRST SCENE),To that contained and high imposing mien
4224,(FIRST SCENE),Which made his father honoured before men
4225,(FIRST SCENE),"Of greater wisdom, more integrity."
4226,(FIRST SCENE),
4227,(FIRST SCENE),
4228,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
4229,(FIRST SCENE),
4230,(FIRST SCENE),And loved before men of more kindliness!
4231,(FIRST SCENE),
4232,(FIRST SCENE),
4233,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
4234,(FIRST SCENE),
4235,(FIRST SCENE),"O Damon, far too happy am I now"
4236,(FIRST SCENE),To grace thy naughtiness by showing pain.
4237,(FIRST SCENE),My Delphis 'owns the brains and presence too
4238,(FIRST SCENE),That make a Pericles!' ... (the words are thine)
4239,(FIRST SCENE),Had he but the will; and has he now?
4240,(FIRST SCENE),"Good Damon, tell me quick?"
4241,(FIRST SCENE),
4242,(FIRST SCENE),
4243,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
4244,(FIRST SCENE),
4245,(FIRST SCENE),"He dreams not of the court, and city life"
4246,(FIRST SCENE),Is what he rails at.
4247,(FIRST SCENE),
4248,(FIRST SCENE),
4249,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
4250,(FIRST SCENE),
4251,(FIRST SCENE),"Well, if he now be wise and sober-souled"
4252,(FIRST SCENE),"And loved for goodness, I can rest content."
4253,(FIRST SCENE),
4254,(FIRST SCENE),
4255,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
4256,(FIRST SCENE),
4257,(FIRST SCENE),"My brain lights up to see thee happy! wait,"
4258,(FIRST SCENE),It may be I can give some notion how
4259,(FIRST SCENE),Our poet spoke:
4260,(FIRST SCENE),"'Damon, the best of life is in thine eyes--"
4261,(FIRST SCENE),Worship of promise-laden beauty. Seems he not
4262,(FIRST SCENE),The god of this fair scene?
4263,(FIRST SCENE),Those waves claim such a master as that boy;
4264,(FIRST SCENE),And these green slopes have waited till his feet
4265,(FIRST SCENE),"Should wander them, to prove they were not spread"
4266,(FIRST SCENE),In wantonness. What were this flower's prayer
4267,(FIRST SCENE),Had it a voice? The place behind his ear
4268,(FIRST SCENE),Would brim its cup with bliss and overbrim;
4269,(FIRST SCENE),"Oh, to be worn and fade beside his cheek!'--"
4270,(FIRST SCENE),"'In love and happy, Delphis; and the boy?'--"
4271,(FIRST SCENE),'Loves and is happy'--
4272,(FIRST SCENE),You hale from?'--
4273,(FIRST SCENE),'Ætna;
4274,(FIRST SCENE),"We have been out two days and crossed this ridge,"
4275,(FIRST SCENE),"West of Mount Mycon's head. I serve his father,"
4276,(FIRST SCENE),"A farmer well-to-do and full of sense,"
4277,(FIRST SCENE),Who owns a grass-farm cleared among the pines
4278,(FIRST SCENE),"North-west the cone, where even at noon in summer,"
4279,(FIRST SCENE),The slope it falls on lengthens a tree's shade.
4280,(FIRST SCENE),"To play the lyre, read and write and dance"
4281,(FIRST SCENE),I teach this lad; in all their country toil
4282,(FIRST SCENE),"Join, nor ask better fare than cheese, black bread,"
4283,(FIRST SCENE),"Butter or curds, and milk, nor better bed"
4284,(FIRST SCENE),"Than litter of dried fern or lentisk yields,"
4285,(FIRST SCENE),"Such as they all sleep soundly on and dream,"
4286,(FIRST SCENE),"(If e'er they dream) of places where it grew,--"
4287,(FIRST SCENE),"Where they have gathered mushrooms, eaten berries,"
4288,(FIRST SCENE),"Or found the sheep they lost, or killed a fox,"
4289,(FIRST SCENE),"Or snared the kestrel, or so played their pipes"
4290,(FIRST SCENE),"Some maid showed pleasure, sighed, nay even wept."
4291,(FIRST SCENE),"There to be poet need involve no strain,"
4292,(FIRST SCENE),"For though enough of coarseness, dung--nay, nay,"
4293,(FIRST SCENE),"And suffering too, be mingled with the life,"
4294,(FIRST SCENE),"'Tis wedded to such air,"
4295,(FIRST SCENE),Such water and sound health!
4296,(FIRST SCENE),What else might jar or fret chimes in attuned
4297,(FIRST SCENE),Like satyr's cloven hoof or lorn nymph's grief
4298,(FIRST SCENE),"In a choice ode. Though lust, disease and death,"
4299,(FIRST SCENE),"As everywhere, are cruel tyrants, yet"
4300,(FIRST SCENE),"They all wear flowers, and each sings a song"
4301,(FIRST SCENE),Such as the hilly echo loves to learn.'
4302,(FIRST SCENE),'At last then even Delphis knows content?'
4303,(FIRST SCENE),"'Damon, not so:"
4304,(FIRST SCENE),This life has brought me health but not content.
4305,(FIRST SCENE),"That boy, whose shouts ring round us while he flings"
4306,(FIRST SCENE),Intent each stone toward yon shining object
4307,(FIRST SCENE),Afloat inshore ... I eat my heart to think
4308,(FIRST SCENE),How all which makes him worthy of more love
4309,(FIRST SCENE),Must train his ear to catch the siren croon
4310,(FIRST SCENE),That never else had reached his upland home!
4311,(FIRST SCENE),"And he who failed in proof, how should he arm"
4312,(FIRST SCENE),"Another against perils? Ah, false hope"
4313,(FIRST SCENE),"And credulous enjoyment! How should I,"
4314,(FIRST SCENE),"Life's fool, while wakening ready wit in him,"
4315,(FIRST SCENE),Teach how to shun applause and those bright eyes
4316,(FIRST SCENE),Of women who pour in the lap of spring
4317,(FIRST SCENE),Their whole year's substance? They can offer
4318,(FIRST SCENE),"To fill the day much fuller than I could,"
4319,(FIRST SCENE),And yet teach night surpass it. Can my means
4320,(FIRST SCENE),Prevent the ruin of the thing I cherish?
4321,(FIRST SCENE),What cares Zeus for him? Fate despises love.
4322,(FIRST SCENE),"Why, lads more exquisite, brimming with promise,"
4323,(FIRST SCENE),A thousand times have been lost for the lack
4324,(FIRST SCENE),Of just the help a watchful god might give;
4325,(FIRST SCENE),"But which the best of fathers, best of mothers,"
4326,(FIRST SCENE),"Of friends, of lovers cannot quite supply."
4327,(FIRST SCENE),"Powers, who swathe man's virtue up in weakness,"
4328,(FIRST SCENE),"Then plunge his delicate mind in hot desire,"
4329,(FIRST SCENE),Preparing pleasure first and after shame
4330,(FIRST SCENE),"To bandage round his eyes,--these gods are not"
4331,(FIRST SCENE),The friends of men.'
4332,(FIRST SCENE),"The Delphis of old days before me stood,"
4333,(FIRST SCENE),"Passionate, stormy, teeming with black thought,"
4334,(FIRST SCENE),"His back turned on that sparkling summer sea,"
4335,(FIRST SCENE),His back turned on his love; and wilder words
4336,(FIRST SCENE),And less coherent thought poured from him now.
4337,(FIRST SCENE),Hipparchus waking took stock of the scene.
4338,(FIRST SCENE),"I watched him wend down, rubbing sleepy lids,"
4339,(FIRST SCENE),To where the boy was busy throwing stones.
4340,(FIRST SCENE),"He joined the work, but even his stronger arm"
4341,(FIRST SCENE),And heavier flints he hurled would not suffice
4342,(FIRST SCENE),To drive that floating object nearer shore:
4343,(FIRST SCENE),"And, ere the rebel Delphis had expressed"
4344,(FIRST SCENE),"Enough of anger and contempt for gods,"
4345,(FIRST SCENE),"(Who, he asserted, were the dreams of men),"
4346,(FIRST SCENE),I saw the stone-throwers both take the water
4347,(FIRST SCENE),And swimming easily attain their end.
4348,(FIRST SCENE),The way they held their noses proved the thing
4349,(FIRST SCENE),"A tunny, belly floating upward, dead;"
4350,(FIRST SCENE),Both towed it till the current caught and swept it
4351,(FIRST SCENE),Out far from that sweet cove; they laughing watched:
4352,(FIRST SCENE),"Then, suddenly, Amyntas screamed and Delphis"
4353,(FIRST SCENE),Turned to see him sink
4354,(FIRST SCENE),Locked in Hipparchus' arms.
4355,(FIRST SCENE),The god Apollo never
4356,(FIRST SCENE),Burst through a cloud with more ease than thy son
4357,(FIRST SCENE),Poured from his homespun garb
4358,(FIRST SCENE),"The rapid glory of his naked limbs,"
4359,(FIRST SCENE),And like a streak of lightning reached the waves:--
4360,(FIRST SCENE),Wherein his thwarted speed appeared more awful
4361,(FIRST SCENE),"As, brought within the scope of comprehension,"
4362,(FIRST SCENE),Its progress and its purpose could be gauged.
4363,(FIRST SCENE),"Spluttering Amyntas rose, Hipparchus near him"
4364,(FIRST SCENE),"Who cried 'Why coy of kisses, lovely lad?"
4365,(FIRST SCENE),I ne'er would harm thee; art thou not ashamed
4366,(FIRST SCENE),To treat thy conquest thus?'
4367,(FIRST SCENE),"He shouted partly to drown the sea's noise, chiefly"
4368,(FIRST SCENE),The nearing Delphis to disarm.
4369,(FIRST SCENE),"His voice lost its assurance while he spoke,"
4370,(FIRST SCENE),"And, as he finished, quick to escape he turned;"
4371,(FIRST SCENE),"Thy son's eyes and that steady coming on,"
4372,(FIRST SCENE),"As he might see them over ruffled crests,"
4373,(FIRST SCENE),Far better helped him swim
4374,(FIRST SCENE),Than ever in his life he swam before.
4375,(FIRST SCENE),Delphis passed by Amyntas;
4376,(FIRST SCENE),"Hipparchus was o'ertaken,"
4377,(FIRST SCENE),"Cuffed, ducked and shaken;"
4378,(FIRST SCENE),In vain he clung about his angry foe;
4379,(FIRST SCENE),Held under he perforce let go:
4380,(FIRST SCENE),"I, fearing for his life, set up a whoop"
4381,(FIRST SCENE),"To bring cause and effect to thy son's mind,"
4382,(FIRST SCENE),And in dire rage's room his sense returned.
4383,(FIRST SCENE),He towed Hipparchus back like one he'd saved
4384,(FIRST SCENE),"From drowning, laid him out upon that ledge"
4385,(FIRST SCENE),"Where late Amyntas stood, where now he kneeled"
4386,(FIRST SCENE),"Shivering, alarmed and mute."
4387,(FIRST SCENE),Delphis next set the drowned man's mouth to drain;
4388,(FIRST SCENE),"We worked his arms, for I had joined them; soon"
4389,(FIRST SCENE),His breathing recommenced; we laid him higher
4390,(FIRST SCENE),On sun-warmed turf to come back to himself;
4391,(FIRST SCENE),Then we climbed to the cart without a word.
4392,(FIRST SCENE),"The sun had dried their limbs; they, putting on"
4393,(FIRST SCENE),"Their clothes, sat down; at length, I asked the lad"
4394,(FIRST SCENE),What made him keen to pelt a stinking fish.
4395,(FIRST SCENE),"Blushing he said, 'I wondered what it was."
4396,(FIRST SCENE),"But that man, when he came to help, declared"
4397,(FIRST SCENE),"'Twould prove a dead sea-nymph, and we might see,"
4398,(FIRST SCENE),"By swimming out, how finely she was made."
4399,(FIRST SCENE),"I did not half believe, yet when we found"
4400,(FIRST SCENE),"That foul stale fish, it made us laugh.' He smiled"
4401,(FIRST SCENE),And watched Hipparchus spit and cough and groan.
4402,(FIRST SCENE),"I moved to the car and unpacked bread and meat,"
4403,(FIRST SCENE),"A cheese, some fruit, a skin of wine, two bowls."
4404,(FIRST SCENE),Amyntas was all joy to see such things;
4405,(FIRST SCENE),Ran off and pulled acanthus for our plates;
4406,(FIRST SCENE),"Chattering, he helped me set all forth,--was keen"
4407,(FIRST SCENE),To choose rock basin where the wine might cool;
4408,(FIRST SCENE),"Approved, was full as happy as I to praise:"
4409,(FIRST SCENE),"And most he pleased me, when he set a place"
4410,(FIRST SCENE),"For poor Hipparchus. Thus our eager work,"
4411,(FIRST SCENE),"While Delphis, in his thoughts retired, sat frowning,"
4412,(FIRST SCENE),Grew like a home-conspiracy to trap
4413,(FIRST SCENE),The one who bears the brunt of outside cares
4414,(FIRST SCENE),Into the glow of cheerfulness that bathes
4415,(FIRST SCENE),"The children and the mother,--happy not"
4416,(FIRST SCENE),"To foresee winter, short-commons or long debts,"
4417,(FIRST SCENE),"Since they are busied for the present meal,--"
4418,(FIRST SCENE),"Too young, too weak, too kind, to peer ahead,"
4419,(FIRST SCENE),Or probe the dark horizon bleak with storms.
4420,(FIRST SCENE),Oh! I have sometimes thought there is a god
4421,(FIRST SCENE),Who helps with lucky accidents when folk
4422,(FIRST SCENE),Join with the little ones to chase such gloom.
4423,(FIRST SCENE),"That chance which left Hipparchus with no clothes,"
4424,(FIRST SCENE),Surely divinity was ambushed in it?
4425,(FIRST SCENE),"When he must put on Chloe's, Amyntas rocked"
4426,(FIRST SCENE),"With laughter, and Hipparchus, quick to use"
4427,(FIRST SCENE),"A favourable gust, pretends confusion"
4428,(FIRST SCENE),Such as a farmer's daughter red-faced shows
4429,(FIRST SCENE),If in the dance her dress has come unpinned.
4430,(FIRST SCENE),"She suddenly grows grave; yet, seeing there"
4431,(FIRST SCENE),"Friends only, stoops behind a sister-skirt."
4432,(FIRST SCENE),"Then, having set to rights the small mishap,"
4433,(FIRST SCENE),"Holding her screener's elbows, round her shoulder"
4434,(FIRST SCENE),"Peeps, to bob back meeting a young man's eye."
4435,(FIRST SCENE),"All, grateful for such laughs, give Hermes thanks."
4436,(FIRST SCENE),And even Delphis at Hipparchus smiled
4437,(FIRST SCENE),"When, from behind me, he peeped bashful forth;"
4438,(FIRST SCENE),"Amyntas called him Baucis every time,"
4439,(FIRST SCENE),Laughing because he was or was not like
4440,(FIRST SCENE),Some wench ...
4441,(FIRST SCENE),"Why, Delphis, in the name of Zeus"
4442,(FIRST SCENE),How come you here?
4443,(FIRST SCENE),
4444,(FIRST SCENE),
4445,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
4446,(FIRST SCENE),
4447,(FIRST SCENE),"What can have happened, Delphis?"
4448,(FIRST SCENE),Be brief for pity!
4449,(FIRST SCENE),
4450,(FIRST SCENE),
4451,(FIRST SCENE),Delphis:
4452,(FIRST SCENE),
4453,(FIRST SCENE),"Nothing, mother, nothing"
4454,(FIRST SCENE),That has not happened time on time before
4455,(FIRST SCENE),"To thee, to Damon, when the life ye thought"
4456,(FIRST SCENE),"With pride and pleasure yours, has proved a dream."
4457,(FIRST SCENE),"They strike down on us from the top of heaven,"
4458,(FIRST SCENE),"Bear us up in their talons, up and up,"
4459,(FIRST SCENE),"Drop us: we fall, are crippled, maimed for life."
4460,(FIRST SCENE),"'Our dreams'? nay, we are theirs for sport, for prey,"
4461,(FIRST SCENE),"And life is the King Eagle,"
4462,(FIRST SCENE),"The strongest, highest flyer, from whose clutch"
4463,(FIRST SCENE),The fall is fatal always.
4464,(FIRST SCENE),
4465,(FIRST SCENE),
4466,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
4467,(FIRST SCENE),
4468,(FIRST SCENE),"Delphis, Delphis,"
4469,(FIRST SCENE),Good Damon had been making me so happy
4470,(FIRST SCENE),By telling ...
4471,(FIRST SCENE),
4472,(FIRST SCENE),
4473,(FIRST SCENE),Delphis:
4474,(FIRST SCENE),
4475,(FIRST SCENE),How he watched me near the zenith?
4476,(FIRST SCENE),Three years back
4477,(FIRST SCENE),That dream pounced on me and began to soar;
4478,(FIRST SCENE),"Having been sick, my heart had found new lies;"
4479,(FIRST SCENE),The only thoughts I then had ears for were
4480,(FIRST SCENE),"Healthy, virtuous, sweet;"
4481,(FIRST SCENE),"Jaded town-wastrel,"
4482,(FIRST SCENE),A country setting was the sole could take me
4483,(FIRST SCENE),Three years back.
4484,(FIRST SCENE),Damon might have guessed
4485,(FIRST SCENE),From such a dizzy height
4486,(FIRST SCENE),What fall was coming.
4487,(FIRST SCENE),
4488,(FIRST SCENE),
4489,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
4490,(FIRST SCENE),
4491,(FIRST SCENE),"Ah my boy, my boy!"
4492,(FIRST SCENE),
4493,(FIRST SCENE),
4494,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
4495,(FIRST SCENE),
4496,(FIRST SCENE),"Sit down, be patient, let us hear and aid;--"
4497,(FIRST SCENE),Has aught befallen Amyntas?
4498,(FIRST SCENE),
4499,(FIRST SCENE),
4500,(FIRST SCENE),Delphis:
4501,(FIRST SCENE),
4502,(FIRST SCENE),Would he were dead!
4503,(FIRST SCENE),Would that I had been brute enough to slay him!--
4504,(FIRST SCENE),"Great Zeus, Hipparchus had so turned his head,"
4505,(FIRST SCENE),His every smile and word
4506,(FIRST SCENE),"As we sat by our fire, stung my fool's heart.--"
4507,(FIRST SCENE),"How we laughed to see him curtsey,"
4508,(FIRST SCENE),"Fidget strings about his waist,--"
4509,(FIRST SCENE),"Giggle, his beard caught in the chlamys' hem"
4510,(FIRST SCENE),"Drawing it tight about his neck, 'just like"
4511,(FIRST SCENE),Our Baucis.' Could not sleep
4512,(FIRST SCENE),For thinking of the life they lead in towns;
4513,(FIRST SCENE),"He said so: when, at last,"
4514,(FIRST SCENE),"He sighed from dreamland, thoughts"
4515,(FIRST SCENE),I had been day-long brooding
4516,(FIRST SCENE),Broke into vision.
4517,(FIRST SCENE),
4518,(FIRST SCENE),"A child, a girl,"
4519,(FIRST SCENE),"Beautiful, nay more than others beautiful,"
4520,(FIRST SCENE),"Not meant for marriage, not for one man meant,"
4521,(FIRST SCENE),You know what she will be;
4522,(FIRST SCENE),At six years old or seven her life is round her;
4523,(FIRST SCENE),"A company, all ages, old men, young men,"
4524,(FIRST SCENE),Whose vices she must prey on.
4525,(FIRST SCENE),"And the bent crone she will be is there too,"
4526,(FIRST SCENE),Patting her head and chuckling prophecies.--
4527,(FIRST SCENE),"O cherry lips, O wild bird eyes,"
4528,(FIRST SCENE),O gay invulnerable setter-at-nought
4529,(FIRST SCENE),"Of will, of virtue--"
4530,(FIRST SCENE),"Thou art as constant a cause as is the sea,"
4531,(FIRST SCENE),"As is the sun, as are the winds, as night,"
4532,(FIRST SCENE),Of opportunities not only but events;--
4533,(FIRST SCENE),The unalterable past
4534,(FIRST SCENE),"Is full of thy contrivance,"
4535,(FIRST SCENE),"Aphrodite,"
4536,(FIRST SCENE),Goddess of ruin!
4537,(FIRST SCENE),
4538,(FIRST SCENE),"No girl; nay, nay,"
4539,(FIRST SCENE),"Amyntas is young,"
4540,(FIRST SCENE),"Is gay,"
4541,(FIRST SCENE),Has beauty and health--and yet
4542,(FIRST SCENE),In his sleep I have seen him smile
4543,(FIRST SCENE),And known that his dream was vile;
4544,(FIRST SCENE),Those eyes which brimmed over with glee
4545,(FIRST SCENE),Till my life flowed as fresh as the sea--
4546,(FIRST SCENE),"Those eyes, gloved each in a warm live lid,"
4547,(FIRST SCENE),May be glad that their visions are hid.
4548,(FIRST SCENE),
4549,(FIRST SCENE),I taught myself to rhyme; the trick will cling.
4550,(FIRST SCENE),"Ah, Damon, day-lit vision is more dread"
4551,(FIRST SCENE),Than those which suddenly replace the dark!
4552,(FIRST SCENE),When the dawn filtered through our tent of boughs
4553,(FIRST SCENE),"I saw him closely wrapped in his grey cloak,"
4554,(FIRST SCENE),His head upon a pile of caked thin leaves
4555,(FIRST SCENE),Whose life had dried up full two years ago.
4556,(FIRST SCENE),Their flakes shook in the breath from those moist lips;
4557,(FIRST SCENE),"The vow his kiss would seal must prove, I knew"
4558,(FIRST SCENE),As friable as that pale ashen fritter;
4559,(FIRST SCENE),It had more body than reason dare expect
4560,(FIRST SCENE),From that so beautiful creature's best intent.
4561,(FIRST SCENE),He waking found me no more there; and wanders
4562,(FIRST SCENE),Through Ætna's woods to-day
4563,(FIRST SCENE),"Calling at times, or questioning charcoal burners,"
4564,(FIRST SCENE),Till he shall strike a road shall lead him home;
4565,(FIRST SCENE),Yet all his life must be spent as he spends
4566,(FIRST SCENE),"This day in whistling, wondering, singing, chatting,"
4567,(FIRST SCENE),"In the great wood, vacant and amiable."
4568,(FIRST SCENE),
4569,(FIRST SCENE),
4570,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
4571,(FIRST SCENE),
4572,(FIRST SCENE),Can it be possible that thou desertest
4573,(FIRST SCENE),"Thy love, thy ward, the work of three long years,"
4574,(FIRST SCENE),"Because chance, on an April holiday"
4575,(FIRST SCENE),"Has filled this boy's talk with another man,"
4576,(FIRST SCENE),And wonder at another way of life?
4577,(FIRST SCENE),Worse than a woman's is such jealousy;
4578,(FIRST SCENE),The lad must live!
4579,(FIRST SCENE),
4580,(FIRST SCENE),
4581,(FIRST SCENE),Delphis:
4582,(FIRST SCENE),
4583,(FIRST SCENE),"Live, live! to be sure, he must live!"
4584,(FIRST SCENE),"I have lived, am a fool for my pains!"
4585,(FIRST SCENE),"And yet, and yet,"
4586,(FIRST SCENE),This heart has ached to play the god for him:--
4587,(FIRST SCENE),Mine eyes for his had sifted visible things;
4588,(FIRST SCENE),Speech had been filtered ere it reached his ear;
4589,(FIRST SCENE),"Not in the world should he have lived, but breathed"
4590,(FIRST SCENE),Humanity's distilled quintessences;
4591,(FIRST SCENE),The indiscriminate multitude sorted should yield him
4592,(FIRST SCENE),"Acquaintance and friend discerned, chosen by me:--"
4593,(FIRST SCENE),"By me, who failed, wrecked my youth's prime, and dragged"
4594,(FIRST SCENE),More wonderful than his gifts in the mire!
4595,(FIRST SCENE),
4596,(FIRST SCENE),
4597,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
4598,(FIRST SCENE),
4599,(FIRST SCENE),Yet if experience could not teach and save
4600,(FIRST SCENE),"Others from ignorance, why, towns would be"
4601,(FIRST SCENE),"Ruins, and civil men like outlaws thieve,"
4602,(FIRST SCENE),"Stab, riot, ere two generations passed."
4603,(FIRST SCENE),
4604,(FIRST SCENE),
4605,(FIRST SCENE),Delphis:
4606,(FIRST SCENE),
4607,(FIRST SCENE),Where is the Athens that Pericles loved?
4608,(FIRST SCENE),Where are the youths that were Socrates' friends?
4609,(FIRST SCENE),There was a town where all learnt
4610,(FIRST SCENE),What the wisest had taught!
4611,(FIRST SCENE),Why had crude Sparta such treasonous force?
4612,(FIRST SCENE),Could Philip of Macedon
4613,(FIRST SCENE),Breed a true Greek of his son?
4614,(FIRST SCENE),What honour to conquer a world
4615,(FIRST SCENE),"Where Alcibiades failed,"
4616,(FIRST SCENE),Lead half-drilled highland hordes
4617,(FIRST SCENE),Whose lust would inherit the wise?
4618,(FIRST SCENE),There is nothing art's industry shaped
4619,(FIRST SCENE),But their idleness praising it mocked.
4620,(FIRST SCENE),Thus Fate re-assumed her command
4621,(FIRST SCENE),And laughed at experienced law.
4622,(FIRST SCENE),What ails man to love with such pains?
4623,(FIRST SCENE),Why toil to create in the mind
4624,(FIRST SCENE),Of those who shall close in his grave
4625,(FIRST SCENE),The best that he is and has hoped?
4626,(FIRST SCENE),"The longer permission he has,"
4627,(FIRST SCENE),"The nobler the structure so raised,"
4628,(FIRST SCENE),"The greater its downfall. Fools, fools,"
4629,(FIRST SCENE),Where is a town such as Pericles ruled?
4630,(FIRST SCENE),Where youths to replace those whom Socrates loved?
4631,(FIRST SCENE),
4632,(FIRST SCENE),"Wise Damon, thou art silent;--Mother, thou"
4633,(FIRST SCENE),Hast only arms to cling about thy son.--
4634,(FIRST SCENE),Who can descry the purpose of a god
4635,(FIRST SCENE),"With eyes wide-open? shut them, every fool"
4636,(FIRST SCENE),"Can conjure up a world arriving somewhere,"
4637,(FIRST SCENE),Resulting in what he may call perfection.
4638,(FIRST SCENE),Evil must soon or late succeed to good.
4639,(FIRST SCENE),There well may once have been a golden age:
4640,(FIRST SCENE),Why should we treat it as a poet's tale?
4641,(FIRST SCENE),"Yet, in those hills that hung o'er Arcady,"
4642,(FIRST SCENE),Some roving inebriate Daimon
4643,(FIRST SCENE),Begat him fair children
4644,(FIRST SCENE),"On nymphs of the vineyard,"
4645,(FIRST SCENE),On nymphs of the rock:--
4646,(FIRST SCENE),And in the heart of the forest
4647,(FIRST SCENE),"Lay bound in white arms,"
4648,(FIRST SCENE),In action creative a father
4649,(FIRST SCENE),Without a thought for his child:--
4650,(FIRST SCENE),"A purposeless god,"
4651,(FIRST SCENE),The forbear of men
4652,(FIRST SCENE),"To corrupt, ape, inherit and spoil"
4653,(FIRST SCENE),That fine race beforehand with doom!
4654,(FIRST SCENE),
4655,(FIRST SCENE),"No, Damon, what's an answer worth to one"
4656,(FIRST SCENE),Whose mind has been flung open?
4657,(FIRST SCENE),"Only last night,"
4658,(FIRST SCENE),The gates of my spirit gave entrance
4659,(FIRST SCENE),Unto the great light;
4660,(FIRST SCENE),"And I saw how virtue seduceth,"
4661,(FIRST SCENE),Not ended today or tomorrow
4662,(FIRST SCENE),"Like the passion for love,"
4663,(FIRST SCENE),Like the passion for life--
4664,(FIRST SCENE),But perennial pain
4665,(FIRST SCENE),And age-long effort.
4666,(FIRST SCENE),Dead deeds are the teeth that shine
4667,(FIRST SCENE),"In the mouth that repeateth praise,"
4668,(FIRST SCENE),That spurs men to do high things
4669,(FIRST SCENE),Since their fathers did higher before--
4670,(FIRST SCENE),"To give more than they hope to receive,"
4671,(FIRST SCENE),To slave and to die in a secular cause!
4672,(FIRST SCENE),The mouth that smiles over-praise
4673,(FIRST SCENE),Eats out the heart of each fool
4674,(FIRST SCENE),To feed the great dream of a race.
4675,(FIRST SCENE),
4676,(FIRST SCENE),Yet wearied peoples each in turn awake
4677,(FIRST SCENE),"From virtue, as a man from his brief love,"
4678,(FIRST SCENE),"And, roughly shaken, face the useless truth;"
4679,(FIRST SCENE),No answer to brute fact has e'er been found.
4680,(FIRST SCENE),"Slaves of your slaves, caged in your furnished rooms,"
4681,(FIRST SCENE),Ushered to meals when reft of appetite--
4682,(FIRST SCENE),"Though hungry, bound to wait a stated hour--"
4683,(FIRST SCENE),Your dearest contemplation broken off
4684,(FIRST SCENE),By the appointed summons to your bath;
4685,(FIRST SCENE),Racked with more thought for those whom you may flog
4686,(FIRST SCENE),Than for those dear; obsessed by your possessions
4687,(FIRST SCENE),With a dull round of stale anxieties;--
4688,(FIRST SCENE),Soon maintenance grows the extreme reach of hope
4689,(FIRST SCENE),"For those held in respect, as in a vice,"
4690,(FIRST SCENE),By citizens of whom they are the pick.
4691,(FIRST SCENE),Of men the least bond is the roving seaman
4692,(FIRST SCENE),Who hires himself to merchantman or pirate
4693,(FIRST SCENE),"For single voyages, stays where he may please,"
4694,(FIRST SCENE),"Lives his purse empty in a dozen ports,"
4695,(FIRST SCENE),And ne'er obeys the ghost of what once was!
4696,(FIRST SCENE),"His laugh chimes readily; his kiss, no symbol"
4697,(FIRST SCENE),"Of aught to come, but cordial, eager, hot,"
4698,(FIRST SCENE),Leaves his tomorrow free. With him for comrade
4699,(FIRST SCENE),"Each day shall be enough, and what is good"
4700,(FIRST SCENE),"Enjoyed, and what is evil borne or cursed."
4701,(FIRST SCENE),"I go, because I will not have a home,"
4702,(FIRST SCENE),"Or here prefer to there, or near to far."
4703,(FIRST SCENE),"I go, because I will not have a friend"
4704,(FIRST SCENE),Lay claim upon my leisure this day week.
4705,(FIRST SCENE),I will be melted by each smile that takes me;
4706,(FIRST SCENE),What though a hundred lips should meet with mine!
4707,(FIRST SCENE),A vagabond I shall be as the moon is.
4708,(FIRST SCENE),"The sun, the waves, the winds, all birds, all beasts,"
4709,(FIRST SCENE),"Are ever on the move, and take what comes;"
4710,(FIRST SCENE),They are not parasites like plants and men
4711,(FIRST SCENE),Rooted in that which fed them yesterday.
4712,(FIRST SCENE),"Not even Memory shall follow Delphis,"
4713,(FIRST SCENE),"For I will yield to all impulse save hers,"
4714,(FIRST SCENE),Therein alone subject to prescient rigour;
4715,(FIRST SCENE),Lest she should lure me back among the dying--
4716,(FIRST SCENE),Pilfer the present for the beggar past.
4717,(FIRST SCENE),Free minds must bargain with each greedy moment
4718,(FIRST SCENE),And seize the most that lies to hand at once.
4719,(FIRST SCENE),Ye are too old to understand my words;
4720,(FIRST SCENE),"I yet have youth enough, and can escape"
4721,(FIRST SCENE),From that which sucks each individual man
4722,(FIRST SCENE),Into the common dream.
4723,(FIRST SCENE),
4724,(FIRST SCENE),
4725,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
4726,(FIRST SCENE),
4727,(FIRST SCENE),"Stay, Delphis, hear what Damon has to say!"
4728,(FIRST SCENE),He is mad!
4729,(FIRST SCENE),
4730,(FIRST SCENE),
4731,(FIRST SCENE),Damon:
4732,(FIRST SCENE),
4733,(FIRST SCENE),Mad--yes--mad as cruelty!
4734,(FIRST SCENE),*       *       *       *       *
4735,(FIRST SCENE),"Poor, poor Cydilla! was it then to this"
4736,(FIRST SCENE),That all my tale was prologue?
4737,(FIRST SCENE),"Think of Amyntas, think of that poor boy,"
4738,(FIRST SCENE),"Bereaved as we are both bereaved! Come, come,"
4739,(FIRST SCENE),"Find him, and say that Love himself has sent us"
4740,(FIRST SCENE),To offer our poor service in his stead.
4741,(FIRST SCENE),
4742,(FIRST SCENE),
4743,(FIRST SCENE),Cydilla:
4744,(FIRST SCENE),
4745,(FIRST SCENE),"Good Damon, help me find my wool; my eyes"
4746,(FIRST SCENE),Are blind with tears; then I will come at once!
4747,(FIRST SCENE),"We must be doing something, for I feel"
4748,(FIRST SCENE),We both shall drown our hearts with time to spare.

4774,HESPERUS,"How many a one hath watched thee even as I,"

4819,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Cuckoo, are you calling me,"
4820,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Or is it a voice of wizardry?
4821,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"In these woodlands I am lost,"
4822,THE CUCKOO WOOD,From glade to glade of flowers tost.
4823,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Seven times I held my way,"
4824,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"And seven times the voice did say,"
4825,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Cuckoo! Cuckoo! No man could
4826,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Issue from this underwood,"
4827,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Half of green and half of brown,"
4828,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Unless he laid his senses down.
4829,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Only let him chance to see
4830,THE CUCKOO WOOD,The snows of the anemone
4831,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Heaped above its greenery;
4832,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Cuckoo! Cuckoo! No man could
4833,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Issue from the master wood.
4834,THE CUCKOO WOOD,
4835,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Magic paths there are that cross;
4836,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Some beset with jewelled moss
4837,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"And boughs all bare; where others run,"
4838,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Bluebells bathe in mist and sun
4839,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Past a clearing filled with clumps
4840,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Of primrose round the nutwood stumps;
4841,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"All as gay as gay can be,"
4842,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"And bordered with dog-mercury,"
4843,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"The wizard flower, the wizard green,"

4845,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Brown, dead bracken lies between,"
4846,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"And wrinkled leaves, whence fronds of fern"
4847,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Still untwist and upward turn.
4848,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Cuckoo! Cuckoo! No man could
4849,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Issue from this wizard wood,"

4851,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Unless he laid his senses down.
4852,THE CUCKOO WOOD,
4853,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Seven times I held my way
4854,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Where new heaps of brushwood lay,"
4855,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"All with withies loosely bound,"
4856,THE CUCKOO WOOD,And never heard a human sound.
4857,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Yet men have toiled and men have rested
4858,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"By yon hurdles darkly-breasted,"
4859,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Woven in and woven out,"
4860,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Piled four-square, and turned about"

4866,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Souls are lost that hear it so,"
4867,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Seven times upon the wind,"
4868,THE CUCKOO WOOD,To lull the watch-dogs of the mind.
4869,THE CUCKOO WOOD,
4870,THE CUCKOO WOOD,A stranger wood you shall not find!
4871,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Beech and birch and oak agree
4872,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Here to dwell in company.
4873,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Hazel, elder, few men could"
4874,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Name the kinds of underwood.
4875,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Summer and winter haunt together,"
4876,THE CUCKOO WOOD,And golden light with misty weather.
4877,THE CUCKOO WOOD,'Tis summer where this beech is seen
4878,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Defenceless in its virgin green;
4879,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"All its leaves are smooth and thin,"
4880,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"And the sunlight passes in,"
4881,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Passes in and filters through
4882,THE CUCKOO WOOD,To a green heaven below the blue.
4883,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Low the branches fall and trace
4884,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"A circle round that mystic place,"
4885,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Guarded on its outward side
4886,THE CUCKOO WOOD,By hyacinths in all their pride;
4887,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"And within dim moons appear,"
4888,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Wax and wane--I go not near!
4889,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Cuckoo! Cuckoo! How we fear
4890,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Sights and sounds that come and go
4891,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Without a cause for men to know!
4892,THE CUCKOO WOOD,
4893,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Why for a whispered doubt should I
4894,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Shun that other beech-tree high,"
4895,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Red and watchful, still and bare,"
4896,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"With a thousand spears in air,"
4897,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Guarding yet its treasured leaf
4898,THE CUCKOO WOOD,From storm and hail and winter's grief?
4899,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Unregarded on the ground
4900,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Leaves of yester-year abound,"
4901,THE CUCKOO WOOD,For what is autumn's gold to one
4902,THE CUCKOO WOOD,That hoards a life scarce yet begun?
4903,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Let me so renew my youth,"
4904,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"I defend it, nail and tooth,"
4905,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Rooting deep and lifting high.
4906,THE CUCKOO WOOD,For this my dead leaves hiss and sigh
4907,THE CUCKOO WOOD,And glow as on the downward road
4908,THE CUCKOO WOOD,To the dog-snake's dread abode.
4909,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Noxious things of earth and air,"
4910,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Get you hence, for I prepare"
4911,THE CUCKOO WOOD,To flaunt my beauty in the sun
4912,THE CUCKOO WOOD,When all beside me are undone.
4913,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Pan shall see
4914,THE CUCKOO WOOD,The surge of my virginity
4915,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Overtop the sobered glade.
4916,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Luminous and unafraid
4917,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Near his sacred oak I'll spread
4918,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Lures to tempt him from his bed:
4919,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"His couch, his lair his form shall be"
4920,THE CUCKOO WOOD,By none but by the fair beech-tree.
4921,THE CUCKOO WOOD,
4922,THE CUCKOO WOOD,O cunning Oak! What is your skill
4923,THE CUCKOO WOOD,To hold the god against my will?
4924,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Keep your favours back like me,"
4925,THE CUCKOO WOOD,With disfavour he shall see
4926,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Orange hues of jealousy:
4927,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Show your leaf in early prime,"
4928,THE CUCKOO WOOD,It shall be dark before its time:
4929,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Me you shall not rival ever.
4930,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Silver Birch, would you endeavour,"
4931,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Trembling in your bridal dress,"
4932,THE CUCKOO WOOD,To win at last a dog's caress?
4933,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Through your twigs so thin and dark
4934,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Shows the black and ashen bark,"
4935,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Like a face that underneath
4936,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Tightened eyebrows looks on death.
4937,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Think not, dwarf, that Pan shall find"
4938,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Aught about you to his mind.
4939,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Cuckoo! Cuckoo! All shall try
4940,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"To win him. But the beech and I,"
4941,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Man and tree made one at last,"
4942,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Alone have power to hold him fast.
4943,THE CUCKOO WOOD,
4944,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Forth I creep,"
4945,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"When the flowers fall asleep,"
4946,THE CUCKOO WOOD,And upgather odours rare
4947,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Floating on the misty air,"
4948,THE CUCKOO WOOD,All to be imprisoned where
4949,THE CUCKOO WOOD,My sap is rising till they reach
4950,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"The swelling twigs, and thence shall each"
4951,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Separate scent be shaken free
4952,THE CUCKOO WOOD,As my flowers and leaves agree.
4953,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Rare in sooth those flowers shall be:
4954,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Cunningly will I devise
4955,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Colours to delight the eyes,"
4956,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Slipping from my fissured stem
4957,THE CUCKOO WOOD,To get by stealth or stratagem
4958,THE CUCKOO WOOD,The glory of the morning petal.
4959,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Where the bees at noontide settle,"
4960,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Mine to rifle all their sweets:
4961,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Honey and bee-bread on the teats
4962,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Of my blossoms shall be spread,"
4963,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Till the lime-trees shake with dread
4964,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Of the marvels still to come
4965,THE CUCKOO WOOD,When their bees about me hum.
4966,THE CUCKOO WOOD,
4967,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Welcome, welcome, cloudless night,"
4968,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Is our labour ended quite?
4969,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Are the mortal and the tree
4970,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Now made one in ecstasy,"
4971,THE CUCKOO WOOD,One in foretaste of the dawn?
4972,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Crescent moon, sink, sink outworn!"
4973,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Stars be buried, stars be born,"
4974,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Mount and dip to tell aright
4975,THE CUCKOO WOOD,The doings of the morrow's light!
4976,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Mists, assemble, hide me quite,"
4977,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Till the sun with growing strength
4978,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Grips your veils, and length by length"
4979,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Tears them down from head to foot;
4980,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Then to the challenge I am put!
4981,THE CUCKOO WOOD,
4982,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Tell me busy, busy glade,"
4983,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Half in light and half in shade,"
4984,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Is your world of wood-folk there?
4985,THE CUCKOO WOOD,All are come but the mole and hare;
4986,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"One is blind, and underground"
4987,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Of that tumult hears no sound;
4988,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"The other Pan has crept within,"
4989,THE CUCKOO WOOD,To bask afield in the hare-skin.
4990,THE CUCKOO WOOD,All are come of woodland fowl
4991,THE CUCKOO WOOD,But the cuckoo and the owl;
4992,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"The owl's asleep, and the cuckoo-bird"
4993,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Nowhere seen is eachwhere heard.
4994,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Those that see
4995,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"The leafing of this great beech-tree,"
4996,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"And its flowers of every kind,"
4997,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Woodland lovers have in mind;
4998,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Those that breathe the scented wind
4999,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Or touch this bark of satin, could"
5000,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Never issue from our wood.
5001,THE CUCKOO WOOD,
5002,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Tell me, busy, busy glade,"
5003,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Are little flying things afraid?
5004,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"All are come of aery folk,"
5005,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Gnats that hover like a smoke,"
5006,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Butterflies and humble-bees,"
5007,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Insects winged in all degrees,"
5008,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Honey-toilers, pleasure-makers,"
5009,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Of labours and of joys forsakers,"
5010,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Round these boughs to live and die.
5011,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Only the moth and the dragon-fly
5012,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Keep their haunts and come not nigh:
5013,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"The moth is moonstruck, she must creep"
5014,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"With twitching wings, and half-asleep,"
5015,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Through folds of darkness; and that other,"
5016,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"The dragon-fly, Narcissus' brother,"
5017,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Flashes all his burnished mail
5018,THE CUCKOO WOOD,In a still pool adown the dale.
5019,THE CUCKOO WOOD,
5020,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Tell me, busy, busy glade,"
5021,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Shifting aye in light and shade,"
5022,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Are the dryads peeping forth,"
5023,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"More in wonder than in wrath,"
5024,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Each beneath her own dear tree
5025,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Parting her hair that she may see
5026,THE CUCKOO WOOD,How queens put on their sovereignty?
5027,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"All are come of Pan's own race,"
5028,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Nymphs and satyrs fill the place,"
5029,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Necks outstretched and ears a-twitching,"
5030,THE CUCKOO WOOD,That Pan may know of all this witching.
5031,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Heedless stumble the goatfeet
5032,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Till four-footed things retreat.
5033,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Cries of Ah! and Ay! and Eh!
5034,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Scare the forest birds away,"
5035,THE CUCKOO WOOD,And their notes that rang so clear
5036,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"At dawn, you now shall rarely hear:"
5037,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Only a robin here and there
5038,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Pitches high his trembling voice
5039,THE CUCKOO WOOD,In a challenge to rejoice.
5040,THE CUCKOO WOOD,
5041,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Cuckoo! Cuckoo! How two notes
5042,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Stolen from all woodland throats
5043,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Make the satyrs stand like stone,"
5044,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Waiting for Pan to call his own!
5045,THE CUCKOO WOOD,How the couching dryads seem
5046,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"To root themselves as in a dream,"
5047,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"And the naiads, wan and whist,"
5048,THE CUCKOO WOOD,To melt into an evening mist!
5049,THE CUCKOO WOOD,
5050,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Tell me, silent, silent glade,"
5051,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"All in light that once was shade,"
5052,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"All in shade that once was light,"
5053,THE CUCKOO WOOD,How went the creatures from my sight?
5054,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Where are the shapes that turned to stone,"
5055,THE CUCKOO WOOD,And my tree that reigned alone?
5056,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Red and watchful, still and bare,"
5057,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"With a thousand spears in air,"
5058,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Stands the beech that you would bind
5059,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Unlawfully to human mind.
5060,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Gone is every woodland elf
5061,THE CUCKOO WOOD,To the mighty god himself.
5062,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Mortal! You yourself are fast!
5063,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Doubt not Pan shall come at last
5064,THE CUCKOO WOOD,To put a leer within your eyes
5065,THE CUCKOO WOOD,That pry into his mysteries.
5066,THE CUCKOO WOOD,He shall touch the busy brain
5067,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Lest it ever teem again;
5068,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Point the ears and twist the feet,"
5069,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Till by day you dare not meet
5070,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Men, or in the failing light"
5071,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Mutter more than, Friend, good-night!"
5072,THE CUCKOO WOOD,
5073,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Tell me, whispering, whispering glade,"
5074,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Am I eager or afraid?
5075,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Do I wish the god to come?
5076,THE CUCKOO WOOD,What shall I say if he be dumb?
5077,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Tell me, wherefore hiss and sigh"
5078,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Those shrivelled leaves? Has Pan gone by?
5079,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Why do your thousand pools of light
5080,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Gaze like eyes that fade at night?
5081,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Pan has but twain, Pan's eyes are bright!"
5082,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Cuckoo! Cuckoo! See, yon stakes"
5083,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Gape and grin like fangs of snakes;
5084,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Not snakes nor hounds are mouthing thus;
5085,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Pan himself is watching us.
5086,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Now
5087,THE CUCKOO WOOD,The god is breasting the hill-brow.
5088,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Pan is near:
5089,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Joy runs trembling back to fear.
5090,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Cuckoo! Cuckoo! All my blood
5091,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Knocks through the heart whose every thud
5092,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Chokes me, blinds me, drains my madness."
5093,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"As one half-drowned, I feel life's gladness"
5094,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Ooze from each pore. Towards the sun
5095,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Downhill I reel that fain would run.
5096,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Thornless seem
5097,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Briars that part as in a dream.
5098,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Hazel-boughs
5099,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Hurt not though they blood the brows.
5100,THE CUCKOO WOOD,
5101,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Cuckoo! In a meadow prone
5102,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"At last I lie, my wits my own;"
5103,THE CUCKOO WOOD,And in my hand I clasp the flower
5104,THE CUCKOO WOOD,To counteract that magic power;
5105,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"The cuckoo-flower, in a lilac sheet"
5106,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Under body, head and feet."
5107,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Above me apple-blossoms fleck
5108,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"The cloudless sky, a neighbouring beck"
5109,THE CUCKOO WOOD,With many a happy gurgle goes
5110,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Down to the farm through alder-rows.
5111,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Strange it is, and it is sweet,"
5112,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"To hear the distant mill-wheel beat,"
5113,THE CUCKOO WOOD,And the kindly cries of men
5114,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Turning the cattle home again,"
5115,THE CUCKOO WOOD,The clank of pails and all the shades
5116,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Of laughter of the busy maids.
5117,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Now is come the evening star,"
5118,THE CUCKOO WOOD,And my limbs new-blooded are.
5119,THE CUCKOO WOOD,So beside the stream I choose
5120,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"A path that patient anglers use,"
5121,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Which with many twists and turns
5122,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"Brings me where a candle burns,"
5123,THE CUCKOO WOOD,"A lowly light, through cottage pane"
5124,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Seen and hid and seen again.
5125,THE CUCKOO WOOD,Cuckoo! Now you call in vain.
5126,THE CUCKOO WOOD,I am far and I am free
5127,THE CUCKOO WOOD,From all woodland wizardry!
5128,THE CUCKOO WOOD,

5143,IN THE POPPY FIELD,IN THE POPPY FIELD
5144,IN THE POPPY FIELD,
5145,IN THE POPPY FIELD,
5146,IN THE POPPY FIELD,"Mad Patsy said, he said to me,"
5147,IN THE POPPY FIELD,That every morning he could see
5148,IN THE POPPY FIELD,An angel walking on the sky;
5149,IN THE POPPY FIELD,Across the sunny skies of morn
5150,IN THE POPPY FIELD,He threw great handfuls far and nigh
5151,IN THE POPPY FIELD,Of poppy seed among the corn;
5152,IN THE POPPY FIELD,"And then, he said, the angels run"
5153,IN THE POPPY FIELD,To see the poppies in the sun.
5154,IN THE POPPY FIELD,
5155,IN THE POPPY FIELD,"A poppy is a devil weed,"
5156,IN THE POPPY FIELD,I said to him--he disagreed;
5157,IN THE POPPY FIELD,He said the devil had no hand
5158,IN THE POPPY FIELD,In spreading flowers tall and fair
5159,IN THE POPPY FIELD,"Through corn and rye and meadow land,"
5160,IN THE POPPY FIELD,By garth and barrow everywhere:
5161,IN THE POPPY FIELD,"The devil has not any flower,"
5162,IN THE POPPY FIELD,But only money in his power.
5163,IN THE POPPY FIELD,
5164,IN THE POPPY FIELD,And then he stretched out in the sun
5165,IN THE POPPY FIELD,And rolled upon his back for fun:
5166,IN THE POPPY FIELD,He kicked his legs and roared for joy
5167,IN THE POPPY FIELD,"Because the sun was shining down,"
5168,IN THE POPPY FIELD,He said he was a little boy
5169,IN THE POPPY FIELD,And would not work for any clown:
5170,IN THE POPPY FIELD,"He ran and laughed behind a bee,"
5171,IN THE POPPY FIELD,And danced for very ecstasy.

5175,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING
5176,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,
5177,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,
5178,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,I thought I heard Him calling. Did you hear
5179,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,"A sound, a little sound? My curious ear"
5180,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,"Is dinned with flying noises, and the tree"
5181,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,"Goes--whisper, whisper, whisper silently"
5182,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,Till all its whispers spread into the sound
5183,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,"Of a dull roar. Lie closer to the ground,"
5184,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,The shade is deep and He may pass us by.
5185,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,"We are so very small, and His great eye,"
5186,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,"Customed to starry majesties, may gaze"
5187,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,Too wide to spy us hiding in the maze;
5188,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,"Ah, misery! the sun has not yet gone"
5189,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,And we are naked: He will look upon
5190,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,"Our crouching shame, may make us stand upright"
5191,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,Burning in terror--O that it were night!
5192,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,"He may not come ... what? listen, listen, now--"
5193,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,"He is here! lie closer ... 'Adam, where art thou?'"
5194,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,
5195,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,
5196,IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING,
5197,THE LONELY GOD,THE LONELY GOD
5198,THE LONELY GOD,
5199,THE LONELY GOD,
5200,THE LONELY GOD,"So Eden was deserted, and at eve"
5201,THE LONELY GOD,Into the quiet place God came to grieve.
5202,THE LONELY GOD,"His face was sad, His hands hung slackly down"
5203,THE LONELY GOD,Along his robe; too sorrowful to frown
5204,THE LONELY GOD,He paced along the grassy paths and through
5205,THE LONELY GOD,"The silent trees, and where the flowers grew"
5206,THE LONELY GOD,Tended by Adam. All the birds had gone
5207,THE LONELY GOD,"Out to the world, and singing was not one"
5208,THE LONELY GOD,To cheer the lonely God out of His grief--
5209,THE LONELY GOD,The silence broken only when a leaf
5210,THE LONELY GOD,"Tapt lightly on a leaf, or when the wind,"
5211,THE LONELY GOD,"Slow-handed, swayed the bushes to its mind."
5212,THE LONELY GOD,
5213,THE LONELY GOD,"And so along the base of a round hill,"
5214,THE LONELY GOD,"Rolling in fern, He bent His way until"
5215,THE LONELY GOD,"He neared the little hut which Adam made,"
5216,THE LONELY GOD,And saw its dusky rooftree overlaid
5217,THE LONELY GOD,With greenest leaves. Here Adam and his spouse
5218,THE LONELY GOD,Were wont to nestle in their little house
5219,THE LONELY GOD,"Snug at the dew-time: here He, standing sad,"
5220,THE LONELY GOD,"Sighed with the wind, nor any pleasure had"
5221,THE LONELY GOD,"In heavenly knowledge, for His darlings twain"
5222,THE LONELY GOD,"Had gone from Him to learn the feel of pain,"
5223,THE LONELY GOD,"And what was meant by sorrow and despair,--"
5224,THE LONELY GOD,Drear knowledge for a Father to prepare.
5225,THE LONELY GOD,
5226,THE LONELY GOD,There he looked sadly on the little place;
5227,THE LONELY GOD,"A beehive round it was, without a trace"
5228,THE LONELY GOD,Of occupant or owner; standing dim
5229,THE LONELY GOD,Among the gloomy trees it seemed to Him
5230,THE LONELY GOD,"A final desolation, the last word"
5231,THE LONELY GOD,Wherewith the lips of silence had been stirred.
5232,THE LONELY GOD,"Chaste and remote, so tiny and so shy,"
5233,THE LONELY GOD,"So new withal, so lost to any eye,"
5234,THE LONELY GOD,So pac't of memories all innocent
5235,THE LONELY GOD,Of days and nights that in it had been spent
5236,THE LONELY GOD,"In blithe communion, Adam, Eve, and He,"
5237,THE LONELY GOD,Afar from Heaven and its gaudery;
5238,THE LONELY GOD,And now no more! He still must be the God
5239,THE LONELY GOD,But not the friend; a Father with a rod
5240,THE LONELY GOD,"Whose voice was fear, whose countenance a threat,"
5241,THE LONELY GOD,"Whose coming terror, and whose going wet"
5242,THE LONELY GOD,With penitential tears; not evermore
5243,THE LONELY GOD,Would they run forth to meet Him as before
5244,THE LONELY GOD,"With careless laughter, striving each to be"
5245,THE LONELY GOD,First to His hand and dancing in their glee
5246,THE LONELY GOD,To see Him coming--they would hide instead
5247,THE LONELY GOD,"At His approach, or stand and hang the head,"
5248,THE LONELY GOD,"Speaking in whispers, and would learn to pray"
5249,THE LONELY GOD,"Instead of asking, 'Father, if we may.'"
5250,THE LONELY GOD,
5251,THE LONELY GOD,Never again to Eden would He haste
5252,THE LONELY GOD,"At cool of evening, when the sun had paced"
5253,THE LONELY GOD,"Back from the tree-tops, slanting from the rim"
5254,THE LONELY GOD,"Of a low cloud, what time the twilight dim"
5255,THE LONELY GOD,"Knit tree to tree in shadow, gathering slow"
5256,THE LONELY GOD,Till all had met and vanished in the flow
5257,THE LONELY GOD,"Of dusky silence, and a brooding star"
5258,THE LONELY GOD,"Stared at the growing darkness from afar,"
5259,THE LONELY GOD,While haply now and then some nested bird
5260,THE LONELY GOD,Would lift upon the air a sleepy word
5261,THE LONELY GOD,"Most musical, or swing its airy bed"
5262,THE LONELY GOD,To the high moon that drifted overhead.
5263,THE LONELY GOD,
5264,THE LONELY GOD,"'Twas good to quit at evening His great throne,"
5265,THE LONELY GOD,"To lay His crown aside, and all alone"
5266,THE LONELY GOD,Down through the quiet air to stoop and glide
5267,THE LONELY GOD,Unkenned by angels: silently to hide
5268,THE LONELY GOD,"In the green fields, by dappled shades, where brooks"
5269,THE LONELY GOD,Through leafy solitudes and quiet nooks
5270,THE LONELY GOD,"Flowed far from heavenly majesty and pride,"
5271,THE LONELY GOD,From light astounding and the wheeling tide
5272,THE LONELY GOD,Of roaring stars. Thus does it ever seem
5273,THE LONELY GOD,Good to the best to stay aside and dream
5274,THE LONELY GOD,"In narrow places, where the hand can feel"
5275,THE LONELY GOD,"Something beside, and know that it is real."
5276,THE LONELY GOD,His angels! silly creatures who could sing
5277,THE LONELY GOD,"And sing again, and delicately fling"
5278,THE LONELY GOD,"The smoky censer, bow and stand aside"
5279,THE LONELY GOD,"All mute in adoration: thronging wide,"
5280,THE LONELY GOD,Till nowhere could He look but soon He saw
5281,THE LONELY GOD,An angel bending humbly to the law
5282,THE LONELY GOD,"Mechanic; knowing nothing more of pain,"
5283,THE LONELY GOD,"Than when they were forbid to sing again,"
5284,THE LONELY GOD,"Or swing anew the censer, or bow down"
5285,THE LONELY GOD,In humble adoration of His frown.
5286,THE LONELY GOD,This was the thought in Eden as He trod--
5287,THE LONELY GOD,... It is a lonely thing to be a God.
5288,THE LONELY GOD,
5289,THE LONELY GOD,"So long! afar through Time He bent His mind,"
5290,THE LONELY GOD,"For the beginning, which He could not find,"
5291,THE LONELY GOD,Through endless centuries and backwards still
5292,THE LONELY GOD,"Endless for ever, till His 'stonied will"
5293,THE LONELY GOD,"Halted in circles, dizzied in the swing"
5294,THE LONELY GOD,Of mazy nothingness.--His mind could bring
5295,THE LONELY GOD,"Not to subjection, grip or hold the theme"
5296,THE LONELY GOD,Whose wide horizon melted like a dream
5297,THE LONELY GOD,To thinnest edges. Infinite behind
5298,THE LONELY GOD,The piling centuries were trodden blind
5299,THE LONELY GOD,In gulfs chaotic--so He could not see
5300,THE LONELY GOD,When He was not who always had To Be.
5301,THE LONELY GOD,
5302,THE LONELY GOD,Not even godly fortitude can stare
5303,THE LONELY GOD,"Into Eternity, nor easy bear"
5304,THE LONELY GOD,The insolent vacuity of Time:
5305,THE LONELY GOD,"It is too much, the mind can never climb"
5306,THE LONELY GOD,"Up to its meaning, for, without an end,"
5307,THE LONELY GOD,"Without beginning, plan, or scope, or trend"
5308,THE LONELY GOD,"To point a path, there nothing is to hold"
5309,THE LONELY GOD,And steady surmise: so the mind is rolled
5310,THE LONELY GOD,And swayed and drowned in dull Immensity.
5311,THE LONELY GOD,Eternity outfaces even Me
5312,THE LONELY GOD,"With its indifference, and the fruitless year"
5313,THE LONELY GOD,Would swing as fruitless were I never here.
5314,THE LONELY GOD,
5315,THE LONELY GOD,"And so for ever, day and night the same,"
5316,THE LONELY GOD,"Years flying swiftly nowhere, like a game"
5317,THE LONELY GOD,"Played random by a madman, without end"
5318,THE LONELY GOD,Or any reasoned object but to spend
5319,THE LONELY GOD,What is unspendable--Eternal Woe!
5320,THE LONELY GOD,O Weariness of Time that fast or slow
5321,THE LONELY GOD,"Goes never further, never has in view"
5322,THE LONELY GOD,"An ending to the thing it seeks to do,"
5323,THE LONELY GOD,"And so does nothing: merely ebb and flow,"
5324,THE LONELY GOD,"From nowhere into nowhere, touching so"
5325,THE LONELY GOD,"The shores of many stars and passing on,"
5326,THE LONELY GOD,Careless of what may come or what has gone.
5327,THE LONELY GOD,
5328,THE LONELY GOD,O solitude unspeakable! to be
5329,THE LONELY GOD,For ever with oneself! never to see
5330,THE LONELY GOD,"An equal face, or feel an equal hand,"
5331,THE LONELY GOD,"To sit in state and issue reprimand,"
5332,THE LONELY GOD,"Admonishment or glory, and to smile"
5333,THE LONELY GOD,Disdaining what has happened the while!
5334,THE LONELY GOD,O to be breast to breast against a foe!
5335,THE LONELY GOD,Against a friend! to strive and not to know
5336,THE LONELY GOD,The laboured outcome: love nor be aware
5337,THE LONELY GOD,"How much the other loved, and greatly care"
5338,THE LONELY GOD,"With passion for that happy love or hate,"
5339,THE LONELY GOD,"Nor know what joy or dole was hid in fate,"
5340,THE LONELY GOD,For I have ranged the spacy width and gone
5341,THE LONELY GOD,"Swift north and south, striving to look upon"
5342,THE LONELY GOD,An ending somewhere. Many days I sped
5343,THE LONELY GOD,"Hard to the west, a thousand years I fled"
5344,THE LONELY GOD,"Eastwards in fury, but I could not find"
5345,THE LONELY GOD,The fringes of the Infinite. Behind
5346,THE LONELY GOD,"And yet behind, and ever at the end"
5347,THE LONELY GOD,"Came new beginnings, paths that did not wend"
5348,THE LONELY GOD,To anywhere were there: and ever vast
5349,THE LONELY GOD,And vaster spaces opened--till at last
5350,THE LONELY GOD,"Dizzied with distance, thrilling to a pain"
5351,THE LONELY GOD,"Unnameable, I turned to Heaven again."
5352,THE LONELY GOD,And there My angels were prepared to fling
5353,THE LONELY GOD,"The cloudy incense, there prepared to sing"
5354,THE LONELY GOD,"My praise and glory--O, in fury I"
5355,THE LONELY GOD,"Then roared them senseless, then threw down the sky"
5356,THE LONELY GOD,"And stamped upon it, buffeted a star"
5357,THE LONELY GOD,"With My great fist, and flung the sun afar:"
5358,THE LONELY GOD,Shouted My anger till the mighty sound
5359,THE LONELY GOD,"Rung to the width, frighting the furthest bound"
5360,THE LONELY GOD,"And scope of hearing: tumult vaster still,"
5361,THE LONELY GOD,"Thronging the echo, dinned My ears, until"
5362,THE LONELY GOD,"I fled in silence, seeking out a place"
5363,THE LONELY GOD,To hide Me from the very thought of Space.
5364,THE LONELY GOD,
5365,THE LONELY GOD,"And so, He thought, in Mine own Image I"
5366,THE LONELY GOD,"Have made a man, remote from Heaven high"
5367,THE LONELY GOD,And all its humble angels: I have poured
5368,THE LONELY GOD,My essence in his nostrils: I have cored
5369,THE LONELY GOD,"His heart with My own spirit; part of Me,"
5370,THE LONELY GOD,His mind with laboured growth unceasingly
5371,THE LONELY GOD,Must strive to equal Mine; must ever grow
5372,THE LONELY GOD,By virtue of My essence till he know
5373,THE LONELY GOD,Both good and evil through the solemn test
5374,THE LONELY GOD,"Of sin and retribution, till, with zest,"
5375,THE LONELY GOD,"He feels his godhead, soars to challenge Me"
5376,THE LONELY GOD,In Mine own Heaven for supremacy.
5377,THE LONELY GOD,
5378,THE LONELY GOD,"Through savage beasts and still more savage clay,"
5379,THE LONELY GOD,"Invincible, I bid him fight a way"
5380,THE LONELY GOD,"To greater battles, crawling through defeat"
5381,THE LONELY GOD,Into defeat again: ordained to meet
5382,THE LONELY GOD,"Disaster in disaster; prone to fall,"
5383,THE LONELY GOD,I prick him with My memory to call
5384,THE LONELY GOD,Defiance at his victor and arise
5385,THE LONELY GOD,With anguished fury to his greater size
5386,THE LONELY GOD,"Through tribulation, terror, and despair."
5387,THE LONELY GOD,"Astounded, he must fight to higher air,"
5388,THE LONELY GOD,Climb battle into battle till he be
5389,THE LONELY GOD,Confronted with a flaming sword and Me.
5390,THE LONELY GOD,
5391,THE LONELY GOD,"So growing age by age to greater strength,"
5392,THE LONELY GOD,"To greater beauty, skill and deep intent:"
5393,THE LONELY GOD,"With wisdom wrung from pain, with energy"
5394,THE LONELY GOD,"Nourished in sin and sorrow, he will be"
5395,THE LONELY GOD,"Strong, pure and proud an enemy to meet,"
5396,THE LONELY GOD,"Tremendous on a battle-field, or sweet"
5397,THE LONELY GOD,To walk by as a friend with candid mind.
5398,THE LONELY GOD,"--Dear enemy or friend so hard to find,"
5399,THE LONELY GOD,"I yet shall find you, yet shall put My breast"
5400,THE LONELY GOD,In enmity or love against your breast:
5401,THE LONELY GOD,Shall smite or clasp with equal ecstasy
5402,THE LONELY GOD,The enemy or friend who grows to Me.
5403,THE LONELY GOD,
5404,THE LONELY GOD,The topmost blossom of his growing I
5405,THE LONELY GOD,"Shall take unto Me, cherish and lift high"
5406,THE LONELY GOD,Beside Myself upon My holy throne:--
5407,THE LONELY GOD,It is not good for God to be alone.
5408,THE LONELY GOD,The perfect woman of his perfect race
5409,THE LONELY GOD,Shall sit beside Me in the highest place
5410,THE LONELY GOD,"And be My Goddess, Queen, Companion, Wife,"
5411,THE LONELY GOD,"The rounder of My majesty, the life,"
5412,THE LONELY GOD,Of My ambition. She will smile to see
5413,THE LONELY GOD,Me bending down to worship at her knee
5414,THE LONELY GOD,"Who never bent before, and she will say,"
5415,THE LONELY GOD,"'Dear God, who was it taught 'Thee' how to pray?'"
5416,THE LONELY GOD,
5417,THE LONELY GOD,"And through eternity, adown the slope"
5418,THE LONELY GOD,"Of never-ending time, compact of hope,"
5419,THE LONELY GOD,"Of zest and young enjoyment, I and She"
5420,THE LONELY GOD,"Will walk together, sowing jollity"
5421,THE LONELY GOD,"Among the raving stars, and laughter through"
5422,THE LONELY GOD,"The vacancies of Heaven, till the blue"
5423,THE LONELY GOD,"Vast amplitudes of space lift up a song,"
5424,THE LONELY GOD,"The echo of our presence, rolled along"
5425,THE LONELY GOD,And ever rolling where the planets sing
5426,THE LONELY GOD,The majesty and glory of the King.
5427,THE LONELY GOD,"Then conquered, thou, Eternity, shalt lie"
5428,THE LONELY GOD,Under My hand as little as a fly.
5429,THE LONELY GOD,
5430,THE LONELY GOD,I am the Master: I the mighty God
5431,THE LONELY GOD,And you My workshop. Your pavilions trod
5432,THE LONELY GOD,"By Me and Mine shall never cease to be,"
5433,THE LONELY GOD,"For you are but the magnitude of Me,"
5434,THE LONELY GOD,"The width of My extension, the surround"
5435,THE LONELY GOD,"Of My dense splendour. Rolling, rolling round,"
5436,THE LONELY GOD,"To steeped infinity, and out beyond"
5437,THE LONELY GOD,"My own strong comprehension, you are bond"
5438,THE LONELY GOD,And servile to My doings. Let you swing
5439,THE LONELY GOD,"More wide and ever wide, you do but fling"
5440,THE LONELY GOD,"Around this instant Me, and measure still"
5441,THE LONELY GOD,The breadth and the proportion of My Will.
5442,THE LONELY GOD,
5443,THE LONELY GOD,Then stooping to the hut--a beehive round--
5444,THE LONELY GOD,God entered in and saw upon the ground
5445,THE LONELY GOD,"The dusty garland, Adam, (learned to weave)"
5446,THE LONELY GOD,Had loving placed upon the head of Eve
5447,THE LONELY GOD,"Before the terror came, when joyous they"
5448,THE LONELY GOD,Could look for God at closing of the day
5449,THE LONELY GOD,Profound and happy. So the Mighty Guest
5450,THE LONELY GOD,"Rent, took, and placed the blossoms in His breast."
5451,THE LONELY GOD,"'This,' said He gently, 'I shall show My queen"
5452,THE LONELY GOD,"When she hath grown to Me in space serene,"
5453,THE LONELY GOD,"And say ""'twas worn by Eve.""' So, smiling fair,"
5454,THE LONELY GOD,He spread abroad His wings upon the air.
