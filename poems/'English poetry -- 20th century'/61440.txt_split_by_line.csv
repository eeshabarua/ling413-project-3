167,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Jew-baiting still! Two thousand years are run
168,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"And still, it seems, good Master Chesterton,"
169,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Nothing’s abated of the old offence.
170,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Changing its shape, it never changes tense."
171,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Other things were, this only was and is."
172,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"And whether Judas murder with a kiss,"
173,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Or Shylock catch a Christian with a gin,"
174,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,All all’s the same--the first enormous sin
175,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Traps Judas in the moneylender’s mesh
176,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,And cuts from Jesus’ side the pound of flesh.
177,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Nor is this all the punishment. For still
178,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Through centuries to suffer were no ill
179,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,If we in human axes and the rod
180,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Discerned the high pro-consulate of God
181,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Chastening his people. But we are not chastened.
182,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Age after age upon our hearts is fastened
183,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"The same cold malice, and for all they bleed"
184,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,They burn for ever with unchanging greed.
185,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Grosser with suffering we grow, and one"
186,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Calls to another “If in Babylon
187,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Are gold and silver, be content with them,"
188,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Better found gold than lost Jerusalem.”
189,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,They forget Zion; in the market place
190,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Rebuild the Temple for the Jewish race,"
191,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,And thus from age to age do Jews like me
192,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Have their revenge on Christianity,"
193,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Since thus from age to age Christians like you
194,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Unchristian grow in hounding down the Jew.
195,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"And thus from age to age His will is done,"
196,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,And Shylock’s sins produce a Chesterton.
197,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,
198,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,But since we both must suffer and both are
199,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Bound in the orb of one outrageous star,"
200,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Hater and hated, for a little while"
201,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Let us together watch how mile on mile
202,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"The heavenly moon, all milky white, regains"
203,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Her gentle empery, and smooths the stains"
204,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Of red our star left in her heaven, thus"
205,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Bringing a respite even unto us
206,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Before the red star strikes again. The riot
207,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Of the heart for a moment sinks, and in the quiet"
208,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Like a cool bandage on the forehead be
209,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Content a second with tranquillity.
210,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,And from your lips the secular taunt of dog
211,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Banish, to hear what in the synagogue"
212,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,We heard once at Barmitzvah (as we call
213,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"The confirmation, when the praying shawl"
214,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Is for the first time worn, and the boy waits"
215,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,For law and manhood at the altar gates).
216,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Whether ’tis true or no, it shall be true"
217,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"just long enough to build a bridge to you,"
218,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,That hangs a shining second till your laughter
219,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Reminds me of my ducats and my daughter.
220,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,
221,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,It happened thus. When the last “adonoi”
222,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Had faltered into silence of some boy
223,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Whose voice was all a silver miracle
224,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Of water, a voice echoed “Israel,”"
225,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"A sweeter voice than even his, but broken"
226,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"With a sorrowful thrill, as though the heart had spoken"
227,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Of countless generations doomed to pain
228,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"And none to ease them found. It cried again,"
229,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Or so we thought who listened, “Ye do well"
230,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"To let the children come, O Israel,"
231,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"But even these are lost and unforgiven,"
232,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Since not of these His kingdom and His heaven
233,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Who at their fathers’ fathers’ hands was sold
234,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"In Calvary; and not their voice, though gold,"
235,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Nor innocent eyes, nor ways that children have"
236,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Of magic in their reaching hands, can save."
237,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"For, though ye offer these as sacrifice,"
238,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,A nation’s childhood is too small a price
239,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,To pay the interest upon the debt
240,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,That all your sorrows cannot liquidate.
241,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,O what a usury our God has made
242,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,On thirty pieces that the high priest paid!
243,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Profit was none, but from the first the loss"
244,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,That grew of the fourth ghost upon the Cross.
245,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Two on the Cross were seen at Jesus’ side,"
246,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"The fourth, the fourth unseen and crucified"
247,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"With piercéd hands and feet, and heart as well,"
248,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,The ghost betrayed of traitor Israel.
249,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Yourselves ye bought and sold, yourselves decreed"
250,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,To the end of the world your doom. For who will heed
251,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"The prayer or utter mercy on a child,"
252,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,However sweet he call? The heart is wild
253,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Of your own ghost, and not the softest lamb"
254,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Of God escapes his sentence. For I am
255,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,The wraith of all your children from the first
256,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Long ere their birth inexorably cursed.”
257,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,None saw the ghost. Some said it was the boy
258,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"That spoke. Yet someone answered “adonoi,"
259,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Thy will be done” and it was finished. All
260,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Closer about their foreheads drew the shawl
261,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"Fearing to see, and as the darkness grows"
262,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Deeper save where above the altar glows
263,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"One lamp, in hearts that Pharoah would unharden"
264,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"For pity rises not a cry for pardon,"
265,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,But to the Mills of God a bitter call
266,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"“Grind quickly, since ye grind exceeding small!”"
267,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,
268,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,"That is the tale. But mark, the moon in heaven"
269,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Is hid with clouds. This little time was given
270,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,To peace and to remembering one another
271,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Who might have been (God knows) brother with brother.
272,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,But since ’tis over and the peace is done
273,SHYLOCK REASONS WITH MR. CHESTERTON.,Shylock returns and with him Chesterton.

302,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Mortality, that trembled in the kiss"
303,I. PHEIDIAS.,"--Even that hair, for all a high god’s art,"
304,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Long since is dust, and dust that was her heart.”"
305,I. PHEIDIAS.,This song of ending in the darkness came
306,I. PHEIDIAS.,"To Pheidias in the courtyard, where the flame"
307,I. PHEIDIAS.,Of torches threw a final light and shewed
308,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Two pillars of the house, a turn of road"
309,I. PHEIDIAS.,"That led (he thought) beyond all sight, and he"
310,I. PHEIDIAS.,Must walk it with a quiet company
311,I. PHEIDIAS.,"--The cold imagined gods, no prayer might cozen"
312,I. PHEIDIAS.,"To help him on the way, immortal, frozen"
313,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Glimpses of deity his hand, creating"
314,I. PHEIDIAS.,In marble out of his heart where they were waiting
315,I. PHEIDIAS.,"For life, had carved, and given them instead"
316,I. PHEIDIAS.,Of life the eternal gesture of the dead.
317,I. PHEIDIAS.,"He with those gods must walk, since he had grown"
318,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Into their silence, and had made his own"
319,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Their longings thus imprisoned, and their heart"
320,I. PHEIDIAS.,On one beat fixed for ever. He must start
321,I. PHEIDIAS.,"To follow, but before his striving spirit"
322,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Steps out upon the road or falters near it,"
323,I. PHEIDIAS.,"One god, that guards the passage, waiting stands--"
324,I. PHEIDIAS.,"His latest marble, made like those, with hands,"
325,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Fashioned, like those, of a man’s dreams, but overstepping"
326,I. PHEIDIAS.,"His maker’s mind, and into a glory sweeping"
327,I. PHEIDIAS.,No man might share. For the great forehead lifted
328,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Out of the shade of life, and light had shifted"
329,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Her quality, whose radiant indecision"
330,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Found, though the eyes were closed, consummate vision."
331,I. PHEIDIAS.,This was the god that dying Pheidias
332,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Had beaten out of marble. This he was,"
333,I. PHEIDIAS.,And would not share with other gods their death
334,I. PHEIDIAS.,"In beauty, but was living with the breath"
335,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Of his creator, who with death at strife"
336,I. PHEIDIAS.,Laid down his own to give his creature life.
337,I. PHEIDIAS.,"This god they brought to Pheidias, for whom"
338,I. PHEIDIAS.,"The whole great world had been a little room,"
339,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Which he had used, as others use, but he"
340,I. PHEIDIAS.,Looked through the window on eternity.
341,I. PHEIDIAS.,"And seeing his god, upon his mind the cloud"
342,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Faded an instant, and he cried aloud,"
343,I. PHEIDIAS.,"As though all Hellas heard him, “O be proud"
344,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Of beauty, Hellas, nor be curious"
345,I. PHEIDIAS.,Of what the secret is that haunted us
346,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Your poets, who had strained to it, and after"
347,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Lay down to sleep, sealing their lips with laughter."
348,I. PHEIDIAS.,"For laughter is the judgment of the wise,"
349,I. PHEIDIAS.,Who measure equally with level eyes
350,I. PHEIDIAS.,"What the world is, what gods, and what are men,"
351,I. PHEIDIAS.,"And twixt too great a joy, too sharp a pain,"
352,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Strikes on a balance, so that tears are shot"
353,I. PHEIDIAS.,"With laughter, laughter with tears, and these are not"
354,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Themselves, but greater than themselves, and each"
355,I. PHEIDIAS.,From other learns and doth to other teach.
356,I. PHEIDIAS.,"We are content with beauty thus, who find"
357,I. PHEIDIAS.,That when all’s done--sculpture or song--behind
358,I. PHEIDIAS.,"What we have carved or sung, a greater thing"
359,I. PHEIDIAS.,Startles the heart with movement of a wing
360,I. PHEIDIAS.,We neither see nor dare see. For our thought
361,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Is larger than we know, and what we sought"
362,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Passes and has forgotten; what we do,"
363,I. PHEIDIAS.,"The truth we did not guess at pierces through,"
364,I. PHEIDIAS.,If what was done was well done. This last bust
365,I. PHEIDIAS.,Of mine not as I willed but as I must
366,I. PHEIDIAS.,"I carved, and now, at the end of all, I can"
367,I. PHEIDIAS.,See that the dream he does not dream is man.
368,I. PHEIDIAS.,"The earlier gods I carved and knew, they wait"
369,I. PHEIDIAS.,My coming as their master at the gate
370,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Of death, for what I knew is mine to have,"
371,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Live with my life, and wither in my grave."
372,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Thus beauty known is fading, known love fades,"
373,I. PHEIDIAS.,"And the truth we know a shadow in the shades,"
374,I. PHEIDIAS.,"And only that which lies beyond our hands,"
375,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Beauty, no earth-bound spirit understands,"
376,I. PHEIDIAS.,But guesses at and faints for in desire;
377,I. PHEIDIAS.,"And love, that does not burn, because the fire"
378,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Is lit beyond the world, and truth that dies"
379,I. PHEIDIAS.,Beyond our thoughts in unimagined lies
380,I. PHEIDIAS.,"That are the truth beyond truth, only these"
381,I. PHEIDIAS.,Are lasting and outwit our memories.
382,I. PHEIDIAS.,But the familiar gods that I have made--
383,I. PHEIDIAS.,With those I will not walk. O be afraid
384,I. PHEIDIAS.,Of beauty attainable and love attained
385,I. PHEIDIAS.,And limited immortality. Unchained
386,I. PHEIDIAS.,The greatest soul must walk and walk alone
387,I. PHEIDIAS.,With what it has not seen and has not known!”
388,I. PHEIDIAS.,Thus Pheidias spoke and presently the flame
389,I. PHEIDIAS.,"Of torches died, his god that had no name"
390,I. PHEIDIAS.,--His latest statue--watched his spirit pass
391,I. PHEIDIAS.,And the dawn came that knew not Pheidias.

395,II. PAUL.,
396,II. PAUL.,"Paul the apostle, on the sacred hill"
397,II. PAUL.,"Of Mars at Athens, felt a hidden will"
398,II. PAUL.,Working against his gospel. That was old
399,II. PAUL.,"(It seemed), yet had the thrust of boyhood cold,"
400,II. PAUL.,"Yet tempered in wild fires, and sensing this"
401,II. PAUL.,"He prayed in silence. The Acropolis,"
402,II. PAUL.,"Making a final bid for beauty, took"
403,II. PAUL.,The dying sun to her heart with the wild look
404,II. PAUL.,As of a woman yielding to her lover;
405,II. PAUL.,And he in flame confederate leaning over
406,II. PAUL.,"With armfuls of clouded roses, blossom on blossom,"
407,II. PAUL.,"Rifled the sweets of evening, and for her bosom"
408,II. PAUL.,Dismantling heaven’s high pavilion
409,II. PAUL.,With tumbled beauties wooed her thus and won.
410,II. PAUL.,
411,II. PAUL.,"This Paul from prayer rising saw, nor cared,"
412,II. PAUL.,"Watching a Cross in the East, if these had snared"
413,II. PAUL.,The West with meshes trailing from the wrist
414,II. PAUL.,"Of Venus, also an Evangelist."
415,II. PAUL.,"“So little is the conquest of the flesh,"
416,II. PAUL.,"So like a spinner, weaving her small mesh"
417,II. PAUL.,--And a boy tears it as he passes by--
418,II. PAUL.,Embroiders fruitlessly her tapestry
419,II. PAUL.,"The Paphian woman, and the threads are thin"
420,II. PAUL.,And ghostly as the new light enters in--
421,II. PAUL.,The tapestry that was the world and all
422,II. PAUL.,The curtain Jesus tears aside” says Paul:
423,II. PAUL.,"“What is there worshipful here? These skies are fleeting,"
424,II. PAUL.,This beauty made by hands of the sun is beating
425,II. PAUL.,"Into the night that swallows her, and none"
426,II. PAUL.,"Is warm, when night has fallen, with the sun;"
427,II. PAUL.,And the whole frame of the celestial
428,II. PAUL.,"Firmament, though dusted with the stars, must fall"
429,II. PAUL.,"As being under death, and change in Hell,"
430,II. PAUL.,"When death is conquered, her corruptible"
431,II. PAUL.,"Beauty, and at the trumpet’s sound put on,"
432,II. PAUL.,"As ye must also, incorruption.”"
433,II. PAUL.,And while he spoke the curtain of the sky
434,II. PAUL.,Night fretted with the cool embroidery
435,II. PAUL.,"Of stars, and the moon upon her silent spindle"
436,II. PAUL.,Did all the velvet warp to silver kindle.
437,II. PAUL.,"But a young man of the philosophers,"
438,II. PAUL.,"Who stood about him, said “The moonlight stirs"
439,II. PAUL.,"With beauty in the heart, and in the mind"
440,II. PAUL.,The things that seem do such a glory find
441,II. PAUL.,"Lit with this wonder of the moon and star,"
442,II. PAUL.,"As almost to persuade us that they are,"
443,II. PAUL.,But these we know are broken images
444,II. PAUL.,"Of patterns laid-up in heaven. Socrates,"
445,II. PAUL.,"A citizen of Athens, was betrayed"
446,II. PAUL.,"To death for teaching this, and smiling laid"
447,II. PAUL.,"His cup of hemlock down, because his heart"
448,II. PAUL.,"Already of eternity was part,"
449,II. PAUL.,And death for such is freedom. Yet for this
450,II. PAUL.,"He did surrender the Acropolis,"
451,II. PAUL.,That had all Hellas for a coronet
452,II. PAUL.,"About her forehead radiantly set,"
453,II. PAUL.,"Island on island, and for this forsook"
454,II. PAUL.,"The friendship of his friends, his dreams, the look"
455,II. PAUL.,Of hesitating spring that dare not stay
456,II. PAUL.,Yet will not leave the hills of Attica.
457,II. PAUL.,"For this all gifts, all memories, he gave"
458,II. PAUL.,Freely believing that the narrow grave
459,II. PAUL.,"Was the end of all. Thus he passed out alone,"
460,II. PAUL.,Content to face the gods no man had known
461,II. PAUL.,"Because they beggar knowledge, and persuaded"
462,II. PAUL.,"It was enough, that, when for him had faded"
463,II. PAUL.,"The light, for us his death a light had lit"
464,II. PAUL.,Would shew a path and we might walk by it.
465,II. PAUL.,‘This is the spirit of man; in vain it reaches
466,II. PAUL.,Beyond the limits ordained and vainly stretches
467,II. PAUL.,"To where truth, beauty, goodness, three in one,"
468,II. PAUL.,Find each in all supreme communion.
469,II. PAUL.,"For what is greater than we know,’ he said"
470,II. PAUL.,"‘It is well to die,’ and smiling he was dead."
471,II. PAUL.,"This he believed, all this he sacrificed."
472,II. PAUL.,"Did he teach better, Jew, whom you call Christ?”"
473,II. PAUL.,
474,II. PAUL.,"A cloud passed by the moon, and no one spoke,"
475,II. PAUL.,Till suddenly her silver spear-head broke
476,II. PAUL.,"The cloudy targe, and leaning from the place"
477,II. PAUL.,She has in heaven struck with light the face
478,II. PAUL.,Of Pheidias’ god. And Paul cried “Even thus
479,II. PAUL.,"Ye have your answer, superstitious"
480,II. PAUL.,"Who set this idol up, and worshipped it"
481,II. PAUL.,"In darkness, and behold the face is lit"
482,II. PAUL.,With fire from on high. A period
483,II. PAUL.,Is set to ignorance and to the god
484,II. PAUL.,"Ye ignorantly worship, and the stone"
485,II. PAUL.,"Or marble of the god ye have not known,"
486,II. PAUL.,Changes beneath my hand and in my speech
487,II. PAUL.,Unto the living god I know and preach.
488,II. PAUL.,Do you rejoice because that Socrates
489,II. PAUL.,Died facing death and dark? I tell you these
490,II. PAUL.,"In Christ are conquered. Death has lost her sting,"
491,II. PAUL.,"The dark her victory, and angels sing"
492,II. PAUL.,"At the empty mouth of the grave, because my king"
493,II. PAUL.,Has made the grave a refuge and protection
494,II. PAUL.,From the pain of living by His resurrection.
495,II. PAUL.,Socrates sleeps; the god he did not know
496,II. PAUL.,"Sleeps with him, and long since the grasses grow"
497,II. PAUL.,"Above their resting place, but flowers reach"
498,II. PAUL.,In vain their roots to find Him whom I preach.
499,II. PAUL.,"He is not there, but though we darkly see,"
500,II. PAUL.,"As in a glass, his immortality"
501,II. PAUL.,"Waits for us all, and beckons in the place"
502,II. PAUL.,Where we who find Him see Him face to face.
503,II. PAUL.,"Socrates, to death a prisoner, did well,"
504,II. PAUL.,But death was all; Christ by the miracle
505,II. PAUL.,"Of the open grave, his deity forsaken,"
506,II. PAUL.,For all the world has death a prisoner taken.
507,II. PAUL.,Nor Socrates in vain all sacrificed
508,II. PAUL.,If here his fruitless death has pled for Christ.”
509,II. PAUL.,Dionysius the Areopagite
510,II. PAUL.,Cried loudly unto Paul “Were it not right
511,II. PAUL.,To shatter on his marble pedestal
512,II. PAUL.,This idol that has stood for death?” and Paul
513,II. PAUL.,"Answered “What say ye brethren, for His sake"
514,II. PAUL.,Who vanquished death shall we the idol break?”
515,II. PAUL.,But even as Paul raised his hand the light
516,II. PAUL.,Faded upon the sculptured face. The night
517,II. PAUL.,"Cloaked it, and, though Paul pressed, the threatened blow"
518,II. PAUL.,Hung in the air and fell not. For a low
519,II. PAUL.,"Strange glory changed upon the face, and seemed"
520,II. PAUL.,A face that Paul had seen before or dreamed
521,II. PAUL.,"To see when near Damascus, and instead"
522,II. PAUL.,Of Pheidias’ god unknown another Head
523,II. PAUL.,Sorrowful-sweet on Paul astonished shone
524,II. PAUL.,"And, ere his threatening hand could fall, was gone."
525,II. PAUL.,But a voice whispered “Art thou after all

608,MARY.,There was no star in the East the night I came
609,MARY.,With spikenard in hushed Jerusalem--
610,MARY.,But a light in an upper chamber dimly lit
