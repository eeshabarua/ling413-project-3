79,THE INVOCATION.,THE INVOCATION.
80,THE INVOCATION.,
81,THE INVOCATION.,
82,THE INVOCATION.,Though oft-times ill-sifting memory with deft digits thickly draws
83,THE INVOCATION.,Ashen grey curtains thwart my vagrant brain;
84,THE INVOCATION.,"She ne’er from me can hide thy face and form,"
85,THE INVOCATION.,"Nor cloaked Oblivion, from streams of Lethe borne."
86,THE INVOCATION.,"Ensnare in sable trammel, behind her basalt doors"
87,THE INVOCATION.,"Thy eyes, thy lips, thy smile,—that ere again"
88,THE INVOCATION.,My gaping senses steep
89,THE INVOCATION.,And lull to fragrant sleep.
90,THE INVOCATION.,Fiercer in Morning Sun than in turgid hues of Night
91,THE INVOCATION.,"Calcined and adust, parching my thirsting sight"
92,THE INVOCATION.,"Thy welcome form appears,"
93,THE INVOCATION.,Grief-giving while it cheers.
94,THE INVOCATION.,Bridget! Unreal! Dead phantom of a form
95,THE INVOCATION.,"Yet living, breathing—sneering, wreathed in olive scorn"
96,THE INVOCATION.,Haunt not my seered soul pierced by thy secret sting;
97,THE INVOCATION.,"Death to a pulsing throb, Life to a pulseless thing!"
98,THE INVOCATION.,"Now through the Gardens of Sleep, I see thy lovely mystic face"
99,THE INVOCATION.,Pale ’gainst the scandent tendrils and resin-bleeding cones
100,THE INVOCATION.,"Paler than ivory white, colder than bleachened bones,"
101,THE INVOCATION.,"Pallid and alburnous, fired for a lingering space"
102,THE INVOCATION.,By eyes that never human in earthy regions saw.
103,THE INVOCATION.,"Let me yet behold thee, far fairer than ere of yore!"
104,THE INVOCATION.,For ’neath that polished painted mask of seeming deadened Love
105,THE INVOCATION.,I know some poignant passion must course in sinuous stream
106,THE INVOCATION.,"Plashing with crystal foam in lustrous realms above,"
107,THE INVOCATION.,"From a sea, where the gods’ romances are woven in wondrous dream."
108,THE INVOCATION.,"Bridget unmask! speak to me, awake, and radiant rise!"
109,THE INVOCATION.,Phœnix-inspired flying from former fires into cerulean skies!
110,THE INVOCATION.,Though still wrapped in the scented cerements of the mummy I thought
111,THE INVOCATION.,was you
112,THE INVOCATION.,"I would gaze on the risen Bridget, as a being both real and true;"
113,THE INVOCATION.,Nothing strange or new—just true.
114,THE INVOCATION.,"In the place of a ghost of a woman, whose self I never knew"
115,THE INVOCATION.,In the place of an empty phantom as cold as the summer dew.

122,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.
123,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,
124,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,
125,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Lo! there in the Garden I behold my princess
126,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Yea! there in the Garden of Sleep.
127,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,There in the Garden I fain would caress
128,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,My lovely princess
129,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,In the Garden of Sleep.
130,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"’Neath the jasamine trees, and the lilac and rose"
131,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,There stands my princess—so close—yes so close.
132,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,
133,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Alloyed with the lilies—the orange pink lilies—
134,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Among the roses and lilies
135,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Stands my azure princess
136,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Lo! there in the Garden of Sleep.
137,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Midst the trembling narcissus and cadmium dillies
138,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Midst the daf-o-down-dilies
139,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Glides my faëry princess
140,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,In her gold-azure dress.
141,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,
142,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"Veridian the foliage packed heavy in creepers,"
143,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Olive the pine tree with sap-oozing cones;
144,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"Each rustling leaf bestirring the sleepers,"
145,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,The brown buzzing bees and the resonant drones.
146,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Dreaming with legs all bespattered with pollen;
147,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,—The passionate kiss of a love giving flower—
148,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"While velvety moths in flight silent and solemn,"
149,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Creep dreamily forth from each scent-giving bower;
150,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,And purple clematis with quivering tendrils
151,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"Drink in the pure air, and sleep-whisp’ring wind"
152,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Sad pale perfumed firs wave feathery branches
153,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,In Columbine’s fingers gently clasped and entwined
154,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,In Columbine’s pensile and pale greeny tendrils
155,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,There in the Garden of Sleep.
156,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Where silver fountains leap
157,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Hid in a deep recess
158,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,There roams my dear princess
159,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,’Neath the Castle of Dreams.
160,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"Sunk there in a carpet of starwort and cress,"
161,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Where myrtle and eglantines gracefully sway
162,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Anent the feet of my lovely princess
163,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Lies a large bronzen bowl where the dragonflies play
164,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,In the sunbeams that blue amber lotus caress.
165,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"Filled to the brim through a lazuli funnel,"
166,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Fed from the meads by a soft lisping brook;
167,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"Pours itself forth int’ a silvery runnel,"
168,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"Which laughing, flows on through that cool shaded nook,"
169,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Cool as the shadows that lie in the dress
170,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Of my peerless princess;
171,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"Blue and crystal the bronzen bowl, reflecting the vault above"
172,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"Sapphire and crystal the red bronze bowl, reflecting the face of my love"
173,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Red and gold the glittering carp that sport in the waters below
174,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Ruby and gold the shimmering carp—the hues of a sunset glow.
175,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"White, ivory-white, and golden green are the lights that fall from the"
176,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,lilies
177,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"Golden-orange and orange-green, the shades of the daf-o-down-dilies."
178,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,But far more fair in that fair recess
179,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,Are the ivory hands of my pale princess
180,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,—There in the Garden of Sleep—
181,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,And her lustrous eyes of ebon black
182,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"Curtained with lashes so silken and sleek,"
183,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"The poise of her head, the line of her back,"
184,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"Arched, as she culls the blood red rose"
185,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"What a wonderful, classical, graceful pose"
186,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,One tapering finger wantonly plays
187,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,With a lambent jewel that gently sways
188,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,O’er her breast.
189,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"In that Garden of Rest,"
190,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,"Where all that is purest, tenderest—best"
191,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,One with another loving contest
192,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,For a smile or a kiss or a passing caress
193,THE GARDEN OF SLEEP.,From my azure princess.

200,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.
201,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,
202,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,
203,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Hid in a tenebrose valley veiled by the mushroom pine,"
204,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Aloof in the lathe of Morpheus—I know a sombre tomb
205,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Engraved on its brazen portal is enchiseled this mystic sign:
206,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"“Behold thou vagrant pilgrim, dark Morphia’s Hetacomb.”"
207,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,
208,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Seizing the knocker in my outstretched hand
209,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,I crashed the head athwart the leaden sign;
210,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,An answering echo wandered o’er the Land
211,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Breaking in thunderous knocks, a pale reflex of mine."
212,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Slowly before my wondering eyes the door
213,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Broke in a thousand fragments to the floor;
214,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Disclosing a gaping orifice with rusty mildewed rim
215,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"The entrance to a stairway, torturous, long and grim,"
216,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Whose polished steps trailed from the sight to denser gloom within.
217,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Then passing ’twixt two monoliths engraved one “Death,” one “Sin.”"
218,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"I heard in the chasm below me the Marid’s enchanted hymn,"
219,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"And I felt the chill of their icy breath,"
220,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,As they dully intoned that Song of Death:—
221,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,“Black and green; with sober sheen;
222,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,They wander to and fro.
223,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,But none of mortal birth may glean
224,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,The rhythm; or why ’tis so.”
225,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Aghast by these secret words of power,"
226,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,From my forehead dripped an acrid shower
227,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Of clotted sweat, and my trembling knees"
228,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Quaked together, like nude limbs of trees"
229,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Bark and knock on a wintry night,"
230,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,For the pith of my soul was bathed in fright.
231,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"So catching my breath for a mighty shout,"
232,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,I felt my life with my breath go out.
233,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Yet only a whisper hissed forth from my lips,"
234,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Breaking between my chattering teeth in strangled shivering lisps
235,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,As I wailed to the dimness within;
236,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"“O! ye who haunt these fœtid bowers, cold Winter has gone and Spring"
237,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Hath come with her flowers.”
238,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"But all that I heard in answer, up the ebon polished stair"
239,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Was the Deathless chant of the Marids; the Jinn with the shimmering hair;
240,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,That woeful hymn of the Marids—that canticle of despair.
241,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,
242,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,“Scarlet and blue in radiant hue
243,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,They wander through Space and Time.
244,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"But none of mortal birth, save Thou"
245,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,May know the rhythm or rhyme.
246,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Great is Suleyman Daood’s son!
247,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Great is Allah! the Only One!
248,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"When Life is lost, then Death is won."
249,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,But by virtue of the sacred fire
250,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Here be the few who may ne’er expire.” ...
251,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,
252,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Faint and weary with soul oppressed,"
253,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,I was fearful to list for the fateful rest
254,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Of the Song of Death—the dirge they sang—
255,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,That ne’er had been learned by mortal man.
256,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,
257,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"So grasping the banister lest I fell,"
258,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Madly I shouted: “Hail, Jans of Hell!"
259,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Servants of Iblees! Peace where ye dwell!
260,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Ye chanters of songs that none may tell,"
261,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Ye who shun the light of God’s good day,"
262,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Answer me! set me on my way
263,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Down these labyrinth corridors of this Tomb of fire;
264,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Built by Magins round smoking Pyre
265,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Where Vathek offered through lust of Power
266,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"All the youth of his City,"
267,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Without sorrow or pity,"
268,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,To the gluted ghool who on evil hour
269,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Came to his Palace with Satan’s dower.”
270,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,And still no answer—but louder grew
271,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,That fearful hymn that no mortal knew.
272,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,And through the transcendent stillness of the air
273,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,I saw their beryl eyes and gleaming hair;
274,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Each holding aloft one leprous quivering hand
275,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,The other chained o’er the heart by a molten burning band.
276,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,
277,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"And up from the darkness, deep down beneath,"
278,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,There came the murmur of voices and the moving of teeth.
279,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Then as if at a sign, or previously bidden,"
280,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"The two pillars close and the entrance is hidden,"
281,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,And from corner to corner the vaulting is riven.
282,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,
283,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"The banisters vanish to float thinly away,"
284,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"The black sheeny steps coil, totter and sway,"
285,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"All is Darkness around, above and below,"
286,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"And blood-chilling fingers brush my forehead, like snow;"
287,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"A hurricane rose, and a wild whistling wind"
288,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Swept up from beneath, and in it entwined"
289,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Were the shadowy Marids with luminous eyes,"
290,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,And a stench like to woodlands where the undergrowth dies
291,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Assailed the dank ether; whilst thousands of flies,"
292,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,The minions of Iblees sped whirling around;
293,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,And flesh semi-fermented smoked on the ground.
294,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Then in the midst of this utter distress
295,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,I breathed forth the NAME of my azure Princess.
296,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,
297,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,...
298,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,
299,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"To me awaking from this evil dream,"
300,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Rose tinted morn appeared in fulgent light,"
301,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,While great Apollo with his spears did seem
302,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"To be dispelling all the hosts of night,"
303,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Proud Helios in chariot thwart the sky,"
304,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Coursing through fleecy clouds kept on his way,"
305,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"And in the dimmer distance, I descry"
306,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,—Where Night her maukish raiment casts away—
307,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"A crowd of fleeing objects, gleaming hair"
308,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Flying behind them in the morning air.
309,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"But brimming joys my sorrowing senses greet,"
310,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"For ’midst the blossoms, sun-kissed at my feet,"
311,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,There where the leaping springs the thirsty banks caress
312,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,Appeared the vision of my pale Princess.
313,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,
314,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,[*] Lathe (lath)—Anglo-Saxon laeth: a division of a county. Here the
315,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,"Division belonging to Morpheus in the County of Sleep, itself a division"
316,[*]THE LATHE OF MORPHEUS.,of the Realm of Unconsciousness.

324,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,
325,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,
326,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,When Luna o’er the vault would fain hold sway
327,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,Striving the steeds of Phœbus to assay;
328,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"And he, the drifting racks with gilded spear had riven;"
329,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"With ochreous steeds coursing the plain of Heaven,"
330,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,Bore high aloft his flambent crimson bowl
331,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,Steering on ruddy Hesperus for goal.
332,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,And far behind his chariot’s dust did leave
333,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,That frail ætherial gleam—the Star of eve.
334,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"I, wearied with the day’s fatiguing sorrow"
335,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,Called to proud Helios “Hasten thou the morrow”!
336,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,Then clapped dim eyes upon the scene around
337,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"The sullen austere hills, the humid misty ground"
338,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,Sad that the spectral lances of the moon
339,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,Essayed the glowing firmament so soon.
340,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,For when tired Earth the arms of Day is leaving
341,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"For those of sterner Night, yet fondly cleaving"
342,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"Still to Sunshine’s fingers, rose tipped as they lie"
343,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"Aslant the woods, the valleys, ground and sky,"
344,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"The heart of man,—in that calm solitude—alone"
345,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,Sighs for his faded hopes now cold as stone
346,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"Weeps for his sins, hoping yet to atone"
347,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"For actions past, unalterable—and done—"
348,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"Performed, accomplished, finished—everyone—"
349,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,Then inly prays with eager expectation
350,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"To Holy patron Saint,—for his salvation—"
351,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"With some such thoughts as these, I sadly gazed"
352,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,Over the moonlit garden’s scented air
353,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"And peering through the mist, I stood amazed,"
354,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,For—lo! my patron Saint was standing there.
355,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,Gabled in raiment pale-azure as the sea
356,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"Of Northern climes, thus she appeared to me;"
357,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"Azure and Silver, like to a frozen tear"
358,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,Shed into Ocean by some arctic Mear;
359,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"Holy her features—haloed her raven hair,"
360,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,Black eyebrows curving over dreaming eyes
361,THE VISION GLORIOUS.,"She stood awhile in ecstacy, radiant, passing fair;"

381,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Then to my couch I bent my weary way,"
382,THE LEADEN TABLET.,And deep in sage reflection sank my soul.
383,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Striving in halting phrases still to pray.
384,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Striving to purge my heart, my mind, my whole."
385,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Sinuous seductive music charmed the air,"
386,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Sweet fragrance cast such perfume all around
387,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"That I was dazed, and seeking everywhere,"
388,THE LEADEN TABLET.,No trace or sign of ought was to be found.
389,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Then in the pentiled garth in virent ramage clothed
390,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Open to view when lying on my bed,"
391,THE LEADEN TABLET.,—A spot that in the sunlight much I loathed—
392,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Transpired the vision of a lovely head.
393,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Golden of hair with slanting eyes of green,"
394,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Sharp pearléd teeth, of glassy, milky sheen,"
395,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Red rounded lips, like cherry cut in twain,"
396,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Chiseled and shapely ears straight backward lain,"

398,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Would madly envy; e’en she could scarce afford
399,THE LEADEN TABLET.,To match her perfect body with the limbs
400,THE LEADEN TABLET.,That tardy came to view below the head.
401,THE LEADEN TABLET.,And still my haunted memory dizzy swims
402,THE LEADEN TABLET.,When’er I view in thought her glowing form.
403,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Mutely voluptuous, standing by my bed,"
404,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Redolent of Eve! Scented like fragrant morn!
405,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Those rounded breasts like snowy apple fruit
406,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Culled from pomegranate tree with leaves of tourmaline
407,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Not even Heaven could stand contented mute
408,THE LEADEN TABLET.,If He beheld those arms so serpentine
409,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Those humid lips, like plum blooms when the sun is warm,"
410,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Nude to the waist, there kirtled round"
411,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"With Zone of silver, prank’d with palest grey,"
412,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Like misty fleeces which at dawn are found
413,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Clinging round hills to greet the break of Day.
414,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Then draperies of leaden hue
415,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Veiled her legs and feet from view.
416,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"With supple motion, noble tread"
417,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Smiling she glided t’ward my bed;
418,THE LEADEN TABLET.,And stretching forth her rippling arms
419,THE LEADEN TABLET.,She bade me look upon her charms.
420,THE LEADEN TABLET.,And forth from her lips this triplet came
421,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"“Ivan, Ivan, _je t’aime, le t’aime._"
422,THE LEADEN TABLET.,_Je te tiens et je te maintendrai_
423,THE LEADEN TABLET.,_Je ne cherche qu’un et je l’ai merité_”
424,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Purling this triplet to a murmuring strain
425,THE LEADEN TABLET.,A magic mean of pleasure and of pain
426,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Languid toward my bed she came,"
427,THE LEADEN TABLET.,And my soul was burnt with a lusting flame.

432,THE LEADEN TABLET.,There ’twixt her naked bosoms swayed that awful leaden sign
433,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Bearing that occult message, that terrible fateful line,"
434,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Lo! there trembled the leaden Tablet that hung on the Brazen tomb,"
435,THE LEADEN TABLET.,“Behold! thou vagrant pilgrim dark Morphia’s Hecatomb!”
436,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"With a howl of ghoulish laughter,"
437,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Like the noise of pouring water
438,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"She leapt into the air above me,"

440,THE LEADEN TABLET.,“Take me into thy arms and love me!

444,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Forsake thou the eyes of thy Bridget!
445,THE LEADEN TABLET.,The ebon eyes of thy Bridget!
446,THE LEADEN TABLET.,And work with a sulphur digit
447,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Through the weft of my firey loom.
448,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Work on my loom of Passion
449,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Where the threads of every fashion

457,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"I will give you a golden promise of a pleasure that none have known,"
458,THE LEADEN TABLET.,And in mine own arms thou shalt learn it; just we two beings alone
459,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Shall live in a world of Pleasure, in a Palace of utter Delight"

461,THE LEADEN TABLET.,
462,THE LEADEN TABLET.,“Dost thou give me a golden promise of pleasure apart from pain?

465,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Take me, ‘my sacrifice,’ take me, to the Loom and the flaxen Zone.”"
466,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"She lifted me into her bosom, caressing my hair the while,"
467,THE LEADEN TABLET.,And over her lips of crimson there played a terrible smile
468,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"“Yourself for the coming bridal, myself I will comely deck,”"
469,THE LEADEN TABLET.,And she fastened her teeth white and gleaming deep into the vein of
470,THE LEADEN TABLET.,my neck.
471,THE LEADEN TABLET.,And I dreamed as ye dream with Morphia
472,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Just a floating, fainting away;"
473,THE LEADEN TABLET.,A dream that is bought from Morphia
474,THE LEADEN TABLET.,And Death is the price ye pay.

476,THE LEADEN TABLET.,But horrid terror seized upon my heart
477,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Bidding me fight.
478,THE LEADEN TABLET.,So vainly struggling in unequal part
479,THE LEADEN TABLET.,I fought for right.
480,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Seeking by blows my ebbing life to save,"
481,THE LEADEN TABLET.,On through the night;
482,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Fighting the fiend, who thirsting, tightly clave;"
483,THE LEADEN TABLET.,—A ghastly sight—
484,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Teeth deep embedded, drinking from my vein;"
485,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Till morning light
486,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Greeted by crowing cockerel, smiling came;"
487,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Then gripping tight,"
488,THE LEADEN TABLET.,I seized her gulping throat in clenching hands.
489,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"With all my might,"
490,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Thumbs fixed like iron bands.
491,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Panting I crushed her skull,"
492,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Kneeling upon her breast.
493,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Then with a vicious pull
494,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"I tore out her pulsing throat,"
495,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Leaving the quivering rest,"
496,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Eyes stagnant glazed and dull
497,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Wrapped, morient in my coat."
498,THE LEADEN TABLET.,
499,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Sweating and breathless, blindly I sought for water;"
500,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Prone to the floor I fell stumbling thwart Zamiel’s daughter.
501,THE LEADEN TABLET.,"Blood, from my aching wound, dripped to the floor;"
502,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Faint in a numbing swound I lay in my gore.
503,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Then gentle hands poured cooling draught betwixt my parchéd lips
504,THE LEADEN TABLET.,Forcing the elixir of life back in thirsty sips
