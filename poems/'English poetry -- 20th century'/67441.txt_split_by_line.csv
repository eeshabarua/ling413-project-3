1445,II,"For this night leave your bible, leave your path"
1446,II,Of selfish righteousness; delay your praise
1447,II,Of God till He has given you a seat

1452,II,"Well, these are facts, even if impolite--"
1453,II,As trite and boring as the price of coal.
1454,II,The lyke-wake dirge comes after; now you live--
1455,II,Too old for fornication--that is true.
1456,II,"But you may love the slender fleeting things,"
1457,II,"The terrible music of the slipping hours,"
1458,II,If sordid Life has nothing else to give.
1459,II,In each clock-tick there is a something new--
1460,II,"Unsatiated sweet imaginings,"

1463,II,"You still have guts and marrow, though your limbs"

1471,II,Granpa’s left behind
1472,II,With baby and the adenoided nurse.

1474,II,Her lips compressed have never known a curse.
1475,II,"Amazed, she sees frail drops are trickling down"

1490,III,And you invite spontaneous destruction

1512,III,"Bleak gaiety of flowers, whiffs"
1513,III,"Of loneliness, ah loneliness"
1514,III,To ever clasp in my caress.
1515,III,"And shall I, poor mazed lunatic,"
1516,III,"When memories come crowding thick,"
1517,III,"Dangle a silly mandrake-root,"
1518,III,Swinging upon Time’s parachute?
1519,III,"Can thoughts have colours, colours thoughts,"
1520,III,Or do I wander midst the orts
1521,III,Of half-forgotten nightmare-pyres?
1522,III,We poets have exchanged our lyres
1523,III,For heart-strings. We have souls to save
1524,III,"From boredom; come then, let’s be brave"
1525,III,"And sing the baser passions, sing"

1537,III,"Low sloping fields of tender green,"
1538,III,She’d love to break into a song
1539,III,"Or dance, a figure slim, serene."
1540,III,
1541,III,All nature seems a parquet floor
1542,III,"To please the sense, to please the eye,"
1543,III,And Lazarus forgets each sore
1544,III,Beneath the thickly-coated sky.
1545,III,
1546,III,The poor lame lady senses whole
1547,III,"The shafts of coloured warmth arise,"
1548,III,A thirsty solitude of soul
1549,III,Looms in her vague pathetic eyes.
1550,III,
1551,III,The hollow spells of Spring are fleet
1552,III,And quick thoughts clatter through her head....
1553,III,“An awkward duck with webbèd feet!...
1554,III,Ah! better far to lie a-bed.”
1555,III,
1556,III,"In bed her lameness will not leer,"
1557,III,"For Sleep’s compassionate and kind,"
1558,III,And she will dance and sing and hear
1559,III,The crooning of a phantom wind.
1560,III,
1561,III,For then her body’s cage-doors wide
1562,III,"Are opened, and the spirit free"

1575,III,With Adelaide and Fanny ... they are dears.”
1576,III,I look around and find two fleshy ears
1577,III,Dangling a pair of ear-rings ... it’s a phase....
1578,III,But all the same I wish that they’d wear stays.
1579,III,
1580,III,When Regent Street is up I always feel
1581,III,"That London Bridge is also falling down,"
1582,III,"Symbolic hulks of granite, orange peel,"
1583,III,And somebody who’s losing half-a-crown....
1584,III,"It is so queer, so queer, to live in town...."

1594,III,With unabated sarcasm to rise
1595,III,"In self-opinion, sinking with closed eyes."
1596,III,
1597,III,A subtle crepitation in the air
1598,III,"As if the nomad camels would return,"
1599,III,As if the burly lion left his lair
1600,III,To have his hair curled daintily. I burn.
1601,III,You do not listen: “there’s so much to learn
1602,III,"From scientific data, palimpsest....”"
1603,III,I tell you they will crumble with the rest.

1609,III,"Before the screech-owl adds to ruin-glooms,"
1610,III,The merry robin-redbreast and the wren

1621,III,"Pleasures and vanities, regrets, desires"
1622,III,Dumped on a dung-heap where the lilies grow....
1623,III,"And these shall be their own sad funeral-pyres,"
1624,III,Destruction totters and his steps are slow.
1625,III,The miles to Babylon? I do not know.

1641,III,With eyes like pale grey membranes fixed and glazed
1642,III,"Ever he stares upon snow-silent fields,"
1643,III,And sweating skies that lean towards the earth
1644,III,Like a great toper leaning at a bar.
1645,III,Ever the mournful cries of mountain-apes
1646,III,"Echo, re-echo, and abysmally,"
1647,III,Ever the sour snow falls. And where’s the moon?
1648,III,"It must hang high, oh, somewhere in the heavens."

1870,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,
1871,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"HÉRODIADE. But who would touch me, reverenced of lions?"
1872,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"Besides, I want no human thing; if, chiselled,"
1873,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"You see me with eyes lost in Paradise,"
1874,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,’Tis when I call to mind your milk of yore.
1875,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,
1876,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,NURSE. Oh lamentable victim to its fate!
1877,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,
1878,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"HÉRODIADE. Yes, it is for myself, deserted, that I flower!"
1879,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"Gardens of amethyst, you know too well--"
1880,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Fled without end into the wise abysms
1881,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Dazzled and dazed; you unawared-of golds
1882,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Who guard your antique mellowness of light
1883,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Beneath the sombre slumber of a soil
1884,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Primordial and primitive; and you
1885,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Oh stones from which my pure and jewel eyes
1886,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Borrow their melody of clarity;
1887,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"You, metals, which surrender to my hair"
1888,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,A fatal splendour and its massive gait!
1889,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"Woman who speak of mortal, as for you,"
1890,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"Created in malignant centuries,"
1891,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Born for the spite of caverns sybilline!
1892,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,According as from calyx of my clothes
1893,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"The white thrill of my nudity emerge,"
1894,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"Aroma of the fierce, the savage joys--"
1895,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Woman who speak of mortal! prophesy
1896,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"That if the tepid azure of the summer,"
1897,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"To whom the woman natively unveils,"
1898,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"Sees me in starlike shivering chastity,"
1899,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,I die!
1900,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,I love the dread of being virgin
1901,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,And I desire to live the terror of my hair--
1902,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"To sense, inviolate reptile, on my couch"
1903,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"At evening, stir within my useless flesh"
1904,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"The frigid sparkle of your pallid lucence,"
1905,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"O you who die calcined with chastity,"
1906,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,White night of icicles and cruel snow!
1907,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"And your lone sister, oh eternal sister,"
1908,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,My dream will mount towards you airily:
1909,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Already as the rare limpidity
1910,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"Of one who dreamt it, in my native-land"
1911,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"Monotonous, I think myself alone,"
1912,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,And all around me lives in the idolatry
1913,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,That in a mirror’s dozing calm reflects
1914,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Hérodiade of clear and diamond gaze....
1915,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"Yea, last of spells! I feel it, I’m alone."
1916,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,
1917,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"NURSE. And will you die then, Madam?"
1918,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,
1919,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"HÉRODIADE. Grandmother, no,"
1920,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"Be calm: withdrawing, pardon this flint heart,"
1921,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"But, if you wish, first close the shutters fast,"
1922,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Seraphic azure smiles within the pane’s
1923,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Profundity. I loathe the lovely azure.
1924,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"The waters lull themselves and, over there,"
1925,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"Do you not know a country where the sky,"
1926,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"So sinister, has all the heated looks"
1927,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Of Venus who is burning in the leaves
1928,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,At evening? I’ll thither ...
1929,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"Light these tapers,"
1930,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"Mere childishness, you say, whose nimble flames"
1931,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Weep a strange weeping ’mid the empty gold
1932,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,And ...
1933,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,
1934,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,NURSE. Now?
1935,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,
1936,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,HÉRODIADE. Farewell.
1937,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"You lie, oh naked flower of my lips!"
1938,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,For I await a thing unheard of yet.
1939,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"Perhaps unconscious of their mystery,"
1940,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,"Unconscious of your cries, you hurl the sobs"
1941,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Supreme and bruisèd of an infancy
1942,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Perceiving dimly ’mid its reveries
1943,TRANSLATED FROM MALLARMÉ,Those frozen gems that separate at last.
