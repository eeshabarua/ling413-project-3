121,THE STAKE,"Crowther took his part,"
122,THE STAKE,"Who lies at the cross-roads,"
123,THE STAKE,A stake through his heart.
124,THE STAKE,
125,THE STAKE,"Spring calls, and the stake answers"
126,THE STAKE,Throwing out shoots;
127,THE STAKE,The towns debate what life is this
128,THE STAKE,Sprung from such roots.
129,THE STAKE,
130,THE STAKE,"Naseboro' says ""A Upas Tree"";"
131,THE STAKE,"""A Rose,"" says Crowther;"
132,THE STAKE,But April's here to declare it
133,THE STAKE,Neither one nor other.
134,THE STAKE,
135,THE STAKE,"Neither ill nor very fair,"
136,THE STAKE,"Rose nor Upas,"
137,THE STAKE,"But an honest oak-tree,"
138,THE STAKE,As its parent was.
139,THE STAKE,
140,THE STAKE,A green-tufted oak-tree

149,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,
150,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,
151,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,A simple nosegay! was that much to ask?
152,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,"(Winter still gloomed, with scarce a bud yet showing)."
153,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,"He loved her ill, if he resigned the task."
154,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,"""Somewhere,"" she cried, ""there must be blossom blowing."""
155,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,It seems my lady wept and the troll swore
156,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,By Heaven he hated tears: he'd cure her spleen;
157,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,"Where she had begged one flower, he'd shower fourscore,"
158,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,A haystack bunch to amaze a China Queen.
159,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,
160,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,"Cold fog-drawn Lily, pale mist-magic Rose"
161,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,"He conjured, and in a glassy cauldron set"
162,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,With elvish unsubstantial Mignonette
163,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,And such vague bloom as wandering dreams enclose.
164,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,But she?
165,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,"Awed,"
166,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,"Charmed to tears,"
167,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,"Distracted,"
168,THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY,Yet--

175,THE PIER-GLASS,
176,THE PIER-GLASS,"(_To T. E. Lawrence, who helped me with it_)"
177,THE PIER-GLASS,
178,THE PIER-GLASS,
179,THE PIER-GLASS,Lost manor where I walk continually
180,THE PIER-GLASS,"A ghost, while yet in woman's flesh and blood."
181,THE PIER-GLASS,Up your broad stairs mounting with outspread fingers
182,THE PIER-GLASS,And gliding steadfast down your corridors
183,THE PIER-GLASS,"I come by nightly custom to this room,"
184,THE PIER-GLASS,And even on sultry afternoons I come
185,THE PIER-GLASS,Drawn by a thread of time-sunk memory.
186,THE PIER-GLASS,
187,THE PIER-GLASS,"Empty, unless for a huge bed of state"
188,THE PIER-GLASS,Shrouded with rusty curtains drooped awry
189,THE PIER-GLASS,(A puppet theatre where malignant fancy
190,THE PIER-GLASS,Peoples the wings with fear). At my right hand
191,THE PIER-GLASS,A ravelled bell-pull hangs in readiness
192,THE PIER-GLASS,To summon me from attic glooms above
193,THE PIER-GLASS,Service of elder ghosts; here at my left
194,THE PIER-GLASS,A sullen pier-glass cracked from side to side
195,THE PIER-GLASS,Scorns to present the face as do new mirrors
196,THE PIER-GLASS,"With a lying flush, but shows it melancholy"
197,THE PIER-GLASS,"And pale, as faces grow that look in mirrors."
198,THE PIER-GLASS,
199,THE PIER-GLASS,"Is here no life, nothing but the thin shadow"
200,THE PIER-GLASS,"And blank foreboding, never a wainscote rat"
201,THE PIER-GLASS,Rasping a crust? Or at the window pane
202,THE PIER-GLASS,"No fly, no bluebottle, no starveling spider?"
203,THE PIER-GLASS,The windows frame a prospect of cold skies
204,THE PIER-GLASS,"Half-merged with sea, as at the first creation,"
205,THE PIER-GLASS,"Abstract, confusing welter. Face about,"
206,THE PIER-GLASS,"Peer rather in the glass once more, take note"
207,THE PIER-GLASS,"Of self, the grey lips and long hair dishevelled,"
208,THE PIER-GLASS,"Sleep-staring eyes. Ah, mirror, for Christ's love"
209,THE PIER-GLASS,Give me one token that there still abides
210,THE PIER-GLASS,"Remote, beyond this island mystery"
211,THE PIER-GLASS,"So be it only this side Hope, somewhere,"
212,THE PIER-GLASS,"In streams, on sun-warm mountain pasturage,"
213,THE PIER-GLASS,"True life, natural breath; not this phantasma."
214,THE PIER-GLASS,
215,THE PIER-GLASS,"A rumour, scarcely yet to be reckoned sound,"
216,THE PIER-GLASS,"But a pulse quicker or slower, then I know"
217,THE PIER-GLASS,My plea is granted; death prevails not yet.
218,THE PIER-GLASS,For bees have swarmed behind in a close place
219,THE PIER-GLASS,Pent up between this glass and the outer wall.
220,THE PIER-GLASS,"The combs are founded, the queen rules her court,"
221,THE PIER-GLASS,Bee-serjeants posted at the entrance chink
222,THE PIER-GLASS,Are sampling each returning honey-cargo
223,THE PIER-GLASS,"With scrutinizing mouth and commentary,"
224,THE PIER-GLASS,"Slow approbation, quick dissatisfaction."
225,THE PIER-GLASS,"Disquieting rhythm, that leads me home at last"
226,THE PIER-GLASS,From labyrinthine wandering. This new mood
227,THE PIER-GLASS,"Of judgment orders me my present duty,"
228,THE PIER-GLASS,To face again a problem strongly solved
229,THE PIER-GLASS,"In life gone by, but now again proposed"
230,THE PIER-GLASS,Out of due time for fresh deliberation.
231,THE PIER-GLASS,Did not my answer please the Master's ear?
232,THE PIER-GLASS,"Yet, I'll stay obstinate. How went the question,"
233,THE PIER-GLASS,A paltry question set on the elements
234,THE PIER-GLASS,Of love and the wronged lover's obligation?
235,THE PIER-GLASS,_Kill or forgive?_ Still does the bed ooze blood?
236,THE PIER-GLASS,Let it drip down till every floor-plank rot!
237,THE PIER-GLASS,"Yet shall I answer, challenging the judgment:--"
238,THE PIER-GLASS,"""_Kill, strike the blow again, spite what shall come._"""
239,THE PIER-GLASS,"""Kill, strike, again, again,"" the bees in chorus hum."

244,THE FINDING OF LOVE,THE FINDING OF LOVE
245,THE FINDING OF LOVE,
246,THE FINDING OF LOVE,
247,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Before this generous time
248,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"Of Love in morning prime,"
249,THE FINDING OF LOVE,He had long season stood
250,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Bound in a nightmare mood
251,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"Of dense murk, rarely lit"
252,THE FINDING OF LOVE,By Jack-o'-Lanthorn's flit
253,THE FINDING OF LOVE,And straightway smothered spark
254,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"Of beasts' eyes in the dark,"
255,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"Mourning with sense adrift,"
256,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Tears rolling swift.
257,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"With o, for Sun to blaze"
258,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Drying the cobweb-maze
259,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"Dew-sagged upon the corn,"
260,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"With o, for flowering thorn,"
261,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"For fly and butterfly,"
262,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"For pigeons in the sky,"
263,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"For robin and thrush,"
264,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"For the long bulrush,"
265,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"For cherry under the leaf,"
266,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"For an end to grief,"
267,THE FINDING OF LOVE,For joy in steadfastness.
268,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Then through his distress
269,THE FINDING OF LOVE,And clouded vision came
270,THE FINDING OF LOVE,An unknown gradual flame
271,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"By silent hands controlled,"
272,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"Pale at first and cold,"
273,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Like wizard's lily-bloom
274,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"Conjured from the gloom,"
275,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Like torch of glow-worm seen
276,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Through grasses shining green
277,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"By children half in fright,"
278,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Or Christmas candlelight
279,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"Flung on the outer snow,"
280,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Or tinsel stars that show
281,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Their evening glory
282,THE FINDING OF LOVE,With sheen of fairy story.
283,THE FINDING OF LOVE,
284,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"No more, no more,"
285,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Forget that went before!
286,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Not a wrack remains
287,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Of all his former pains.
288,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"Here's Love a drench of light,"
289,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"A Sun dazzling the sight,"
290,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Well started on his race
291,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Towards the Zenith space
292,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Where fixed and sure
293,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"He shall endure,"
294,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Holding peace secure.
295,THE FINDING OF LOVE,
296,THE FINDING OF LOVE,Now with his blaze
297,THE FINDING OF LOVE,He dries the cobweb maze
298,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"Dew-sagging on the corn,"
299,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"He brings the flowering thorn,"
300,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"The fly and butterfly,"
301,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"And pigeons in the sky,"
302,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"The robin and the thrush,"
303,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"And the long bulrush,"
304,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"And cherry under the leaf,"
305,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"Earth in a silken dress,"
306,THE FINDING OF LOVE,"With end to grief,"
307,THE FINDING OF LOVE,With love in steadfastness.

313,REPROACH,
314,REPROACH,
315,REPROACH,Your grieving moonlight face looks down
316,REPROACH,"Through the forest of my fears,"
317,REPROACH,"Crowned with a spiny bramble-crown,"
318,REPROACH,Dew-dropped with evening tears.
319,REPROACH,
320,REPROACH,"Why do you spell ""untrue, unkind,"""
321,REPROACH,Reproachful eyes plaguing my sleep?
322,REPROACH,I am not guilty in my mind
323,REPROACH,Of aught would make you weep.
324,REPROACH,
325,REPROACH,"Untrue? but how, what broken oath?"
326,REPROACH,Unkind? I know not even your name.
327,REPROACH,"Unkind, untrue, you charge me both,"
328,REPROACH,Scalding my heart with shame.
329,REPROACH,
330,REPROACH,"The black trees shudder, dropping snow,"
331,REPROACH,The stars tumble and spin.
332,REPROACH,"Speak, speak, or how may a child know"
333,REPROACH,His ancestral sin?

340,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,
341,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Glinting on the roadway
342,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,A broken mirror lay:
343,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Then what did the child say
344,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Who found it there?
345,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,He cried there was a goblin
346,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Looking out as he looked in--
347,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"Wild eyes and speckled skin,"
348,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"Black, bristling hair!"
349,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,
350,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,He brought it to his father
351,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Who being a simple sailor
352,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"Swore, ""This is a true wonder,"
353,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Deny it who can!
354,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"Plain enough to me, for one,"
355,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,It's a portrait aptly done
356,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"Of Admiral, the great Lord Nelson"
357,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"When a young man."""
358,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,
359,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,The sailor's wife perceiving
360,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Her husband had some pretty thing
361,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"At which he was peering,"
362,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Seized it from his hand.
363,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"Then tears started and ran free,"
364,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"""Jack, you have deceived me,"
365,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"I love you no more,"" said she,"
366,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"""So understand!"""
367,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,
368,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"""But, Mary,"" says the sailor,"
369,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"""This is a famous treasure,"
370,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Admiral Nelson's picture
371,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"Taken in youth."""
372,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"""Viper and fox,"" she cries,"
373,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"""To trick me with such lies,"
374,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Who is this wench with the bold eyes?
375,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"Tell the full truth!"""
376,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,
377,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Up rides the parish priest
378,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Mounted on a fat beast.
379,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Grief and anger have not ceased
380,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Between those two;
381,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Little Tom still weeps for fear;
382,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"He has seen Hobgoblin, near,"
383,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Great white teeth and foul leer
384,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,That pierced him through.
385,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,
386,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Now the old priest lifts his glove
387,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Bidding all for God's love
388,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"To stand and not to move,"
389,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Lest blood be shed.
390,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"""O, O!"" cries the urchin,"
391,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"""I saw the devil grin,"
392,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"He glared out, as I looked in;"
393,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"A true death's head!"""
394,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,
395,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"Mary weeps, ""Ah, Father,"
396,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,My Jack loves another!
397,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,On some voyage he courted her
398,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"In a land afar."""
399,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"This, with cursing, Jack denies:--"
400,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"""Father, use your own eyes:"
401,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,It is Lord Nelson in disguise
402,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"As a young tar."""
403,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,
404,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"When the priest took the glass,"
405,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Fresh marvels came to pass
406,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"""A saint of glory, by the Mass!"
407,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"""Where got you this?"""
408,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"He signed him with the good Sign,"
409,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"Be sure the relic was divine,"
410,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,He would fix it in a shrine
411,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,For pilgrims to kiss.
412,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,
413,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,There the chapel folk who come
414,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"(Honest, some, and lewd, some),"
415,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"See the saint's eyes and are dumb,"
416,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,Kneeling on the flags.
417,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"Some see the Doubter Thomas,"
418,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,"And some Nathaniel in the glass,"
419,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,And others whom but old Saint Judas
420,THE MAGICAL PICTURE,With his money bags?

425,DISTANT SMOKE,DISTANT SMOKE
426,DISTANT SMOKE,
427,DISTANT SMOKE,
428,DISTANT SMOKE,Seth and the sons of Seth who followed him
429,DISTANT SMOKE,"Halted in silence: labour, then, was vain."
430,DISTANT SMOKE,"Fast at the zenith, blazoned in his splendour,"
431,DISTANT SMOKE,"Hung the fierce Sun, wherefore these travelling folk"
432,DISTANT SMOKE,Stood centred each in his own disc of shade.
433,DISTANT SMOKE,The term proposed was ended; now to enjoy
434,DISTANT SMOKE,The moment's melancholy; their tears fell shining.
435,DISTANT SMOKE,
436,DISTANT SMOKE,"Yesterday early at the dreadful hour,"
437,DISTANT SMOKE,"When life ebbs lowest, when the strand of being"
438,DISTANT SMOKE,Is slowly bared until discovered show
439,DISTANT SMOKE,Weed-mantelled hulks that foundered years ago
440,DISTANT SMOKE,"At autumn anchorage, then father Adam"
441,DISTANT SMOKE,Summoned in haste his elder generations
442,DISTANT SMOKE,"To his death-tent, and gasping spoke to them,"
443,DISTANT SMOKE,Forthwith defining an immediate journey
444,DISTANT SMOKE,"Beyond the eastern ridge, in quest for one"
445,DISTANT SMOKE,"Whom he named Cain, brother to Seth, true uncle"
446,DISTANT SMOKE,To these young spearmen; they should lead him here
447,DISTANT SMOKE,For a last benediction at his hands.
448,DISTANT SMOKE,
449,DISTANT SMOKE,First-born yet outlawed! Scarcely they believed
450,DISTANT SMOKE,"In this strange word of ""Cain,"" in this new man,"
451,DISTANT SMOKE,"Man, yet outside the tents; but Adam swore"
452,DISTANT SMOKE,And gave them a fair sign of recognition.
453,DISTANT SMOKE,"There was a brand, he said, a firm red pillar"
454,DISTANT SMOKE,"Parting Cain's brows, and Cain had mighty hands,"
455,DISTANT SMOKE,"Sprouting luxurious hair, red, like his beard."
456,DISTANT SMOKE,Moreover Adam said that by huge strength
457,DISTANT SMOKE,"Himself could stay this ebb of early morning,"
458,DISTANT SMOKE,"Yet three days longer, three days, though no more--"
459,DISTANT SMOKE,This for the stern desire and long disquietude
460,DISTANT SMOKE,That was his love for Cain; whom God had cursed.
461,DISTANT SMOKE,Then would he kiss all fatherly and so die--
462,DISTANT SMOKE,"Kneeling, with eyes abased, they made him promise,"
463,DISTANT SMOKE,"Swore, at the midpoint of their second day,"
464,DISTANT SMOKE,"If unsped in the search of whom he named,"
465,DISTANT SMOKE,They would come hasting home to Adam's tent.

727,THE GNAT,
728,THE GNAT,The shepherd Watkin heard an inner voice
729,THE GNAT,"Calling ""My creature, ho! be warned, be ready!"""
730,THE GNAT,"Calling, ""The moment comes, therefore be ready!"""
731,THE GNAT,"And a third time calling, ""Creature, be ready!"""
732,THE GNAT,
733,THE GNAT,"This old poor man mistook the call, which sounded"
734,THE GNAT,"Not for himself, but for his pensioner."
735,THE GNAT,Now (truth or phantasy) the shepherd nourished
736,THE GNAT,"Fast in his brain, due earnings of transgression,"
737,THE GNAT,A creature like to that avenging fly
738,THE GNAT,"Once crept unseen in at King Herod's ear,"
739,THE GNAT,"Tunnelling gradually inwards, upwards,"
740,THE GNAT,"Heading for flowery pastures of the brain,"
741,THE GNAT,"And battened on such grand, presumptuous fare"
742,THE GNAT,As grew him brazen claws and brazen hair
743,THE GNAT,And wings of iron mail. Old Watkin felt
744,THE GNAT,A like intruder channelling to and fro.
745,THE GNAT,"He cursed his day and sin done in past years,"
746,THE GNAT,"Repentance choked, pride that outlawed his heart,"
747,THE GNAT,So that at night often in thunderous weather
748,THE GNAT,Racked with the pain he'd start
749,THE GNAT,"From sleep, incontinently howling, leaping,"
750,THE GNAT,"Striking his hoar head on the cottage walls,"
751,THE GNAT,"Stamping his feet, dragging his hair by the roots."
752,THE GNAT,"He'd rouse the Gnat to anger, send it buzzing"
753,THE GNAT,"Like a huge mill, scraping with metal claws"
754,THE GNAT,At his midpoint of being; forthwith tumble
755,THE GNAT,With a great cry for Death to stoop and end him.
756,THE GNAT,
757,THE GNAT,"Now Watkin hears the voice and weeps for bliss,"
758,THE GNAT,"The voice that warned ""Creature, the time is come."""
759,THE GNAT,"Merciful Death, was it Death, all his desire?"
760,THE GNAT,"Promised of Heaven, and speedy? O Death, come!"
761,THE GNAT,
762,THE GNAT,"Only for one thought must he make provision,"
763,THE GNAT,"For honest Prinny, for old bob-tail Prinny."
764,THE GNAT,Another master? Where? These hillside crofters
765,THE GNAT,Were spiteful to their beasts and mercenary.
766,THE GNAT,"Prinny to such? No, Prinny too must die."
767,THE GNAT,"By his own hand, then? Murder! By what other?"
768,THE GNAT,"No human hand should touch the sacrifice,"
769,THE GNAT,No human hand;
770,THE GNAT,"God's hand then, through his temporal minister."
771,THE GNAT,
772,THE GNAT,Three times has Watkin in the morning early
773,THE GNAT,"When not a soul was rising, left his flock,"
774,THE GNAT,"Come to the Minister's house through the cold mist,"
775,THE GNAT,"Clicked at the latch and slowly moved the gate,"
776,THE GNAT,"Faltered, held back and dared not enter in."
777,THE GNAT,"""Not this time, Prinny, we'll not rouse them yet,"
778,THE GNAT,"To-morrow, surely, for our death is tokened,"
779,THE GNAT,My death and your death with small interval.
780,THE GNAT,"We meet in fields beyond; be sure of it, Prinny!"""
781,THE GNAT,
782,THE GNAT,On the next night
783,THE GNAT,"The busy Gnat, swollen to giant size,"
784,THE GNAT,"Pent-up within the skull, knew certainly,"
785,THE GNAT,"As a bird knows in the egg, his hour was come."
786,THE GNAT,The thrice repeated call had given him summons ...
787,THE GNAT,"He must out, crack the shell, out, out!"
788,THE GNAT,"He strains, claps his wings, arches his back,"
789,THE GNAT,"Drives in his talons, out! out!"
790,THE GNAT,
791,THE GNAT,"In the white anguish of this travail, Watkin"
792,THE GNAT,"Hurls off his blankets, tears an axe from the nail"
793,THE GNAT,"Batters the bed, hews table, splits the floor,"
794,THE GNAT,"Hears Prinny whine at his feet, leaps, strikes again,"
795,THE GNAT,"Strikes, yammering."
796,THE GNAT,At that instant with a clatter
797,THE GNAT,"Noise of a bursting dam, a toppling wall,"
798,THE GNAT,Out flies the new-born creature from his mouth
799,THE GNAT,"And humming fearsomely like a huge engine,"
800,THE GNAT,"Rackets about the room, smites the unseen"
801,THE GNAT,"Glass of half-open windows, reels, recovers,"
802,THE GNAT,"Soars out into the meadows, and is gone."
803,THE GNAT,
804,THE GNAT,Silence prolonged to an age. Watkin still lives?
805,THE GNAT,The hour of travail by the voice foretold
806,THE GNAT,Brought no last throbbings of the dying Body
807,THE GNAT,In child-birth of the Soul. Watkin still lives.
808,THE GNAT,
809,THE GNAT,Labourer Watkin delves in the wet fields.
810,THE GNAT,"Did an old shepherd die that night with Prinny,"
811,THE GNAT,Die weeping with his head on the outraged corpse?
812,THE GNAT,"Oh, he's forgotten. A dead dream, a cloud."
813,THE GNAT,"Labourer Watkin delves, drowsily, numbly,"
814,THE GNAT,His harsh spade grates among the buried stones.

911,DOWN,"Through mattress, bed, floor, floors beneath, stairs, cellars,"

929,DOWN,"Fainter and fainter, merged in the gradual hum"

931,DOWN,To chill the drowsy air; he for a while
932,DOWN,Lay without spirit; until that floated back
933,DOWN,"From the deep waters. Oh, to renew now"
934,DOWN,"The bliss of repossession, kindly sun"
935,DOWN,"Forfeit for ever, and the scent of thyme!"
