1120,IN THE BEGINNING,"No slumber that shall cease,"
1121,IN THE BEGINNING,But charmed safety of a faith as sure
1122,IN THE BEGINNING,As a mountain’s founding to endure:

1139,IN THE BEGINNING,Setteth his love upon
1140,IN THE BEGINNING,"God, his Lord, his Thought, his Lover dear:"
1141,IN THE BEGINNING,"And, in lapse of silence falling clear,"

1912,A DANCE OF DEATH,A DANCE OF DEATH
1913,A DANCE OF DEATH,
1914,A DANCE OF DEATH,
1915,A DANCE OF DEATH,How lovely is a silver winter-day
1916,A DANCE OF DEATH,Of sturdy ice.
1917,A DANCE OF DEATH,That clogs the hidden river’s tiniest bay
1918,A DANCE OF DEATH,With diamond-stone of price
1919,A DANCE OF DEATH,To make an empress cast her dazzling stones
1920,A DANCE OF DEATH,Upon its light as hail--
1921,A DANCE OF DEATH,So little its effulgency condones
1922,A DANCE OF DEATH,Her diamonds’ denser trail
1923,A DANCE OF DEATH,Of radiance on the air!
1924,A DANCE OF DEATH,"How strange this ice, so motionless and still,"
1925,A DANCE OF DEATH,"Yet calling as with music to our feet,"
1926,A DANCE OF DEATH,So that they chafe and dare
1927,A DANCE OF DEATH,Their swiftest motion to repeat
1928,A DANCE OF DEATH,"These harmonies of challenge, sounds that fill"
1929,A DANCE OF DEATH,"The floor of ice, as the crystalline sphere"
1930,A DANCE OF DEATH,Around the heavens is filled with such a song
1931,A DANCE OF DEATH,"That, when they hear,"
1932,A DANCE OF DEATH,"The stars, each in their heaven, are drawn along!"
1933,A DANCE OF DEATH,
1934,A DANCE OF DEATH,"Oh, see, a dancer! One whose feet"
1935,A DANCE OF DEATH,Move on unshod with steel!
1936,A DANCE OF DEATH,She is not skating fleet
1937,A DANCE OF DEATH,"On toe and heel,"
1938,A DANCE OF DEATH,"But only tip-toe dances in a whirl,"
1939,A DANCE OF DEATH,"A lovely dancing-girl,"
1940,A DANCE OF DEATH,Upon the frozen surface of the stream.
1941,A DANCE OF DEATH,"Without a wonder, it would seem,"
1942,A DANCE OF DEATH,"She could not keep her sway,"
1943,A DANCE OF DEATH,The balance of her limbs
1944,A DANCE OF DEATH,"Sure on the musical, iced river-way"
1945,A DANCE OF DEATH,"That, sparkling, dims"
1946,A DANCE OF DEATH,"Her trinkets as they swing, so high its sparks"
1947,A DANCE OF DEATH,Tingle the sun and scatter song like larks.
1948,A DANCE OF DEATH,
1949,A DANCE OF DEATH,She dances mid the sumptuous whiteness set
1950,A DANCE OF DEATH,Of winter’s sunniest noon;
1951,A DANCE OF DEATH,She dances as the sun-rays that forget
1952,A DANCE OF DEATH,In winter sunset falleth soon
1953,A DANCE OF DEATH,To sheer sunset:
1954,A DANCE OF DEATH,She dances with a languor through the frost
1955,A DANCE OF DEATH,"As she had never lost,"
1956,A DANCE OF DEATH,"In lands where there is snow,"
1957,A DANCE OF DEATH,The Orient’s immeasurable glow.
1958,A DANCE OF DEATH,
1959,A DANCE OF DEATH,Who is this dancer white--
1960,A DANCE OF DEATH,"A creature slight,"
1961,A DANCE OF DEATH,"Weaving the East upon a stream of ice,"
1962,A DANCE OF DEATH,That in a trice
1963,A DANCE OF DEATH,Might trip the dance and fling the dancer down?
1964,A DANCE OF DEATH,Does she not know deeps under ice can drown?
1965,A DANCE OF DEATH,
1966,A DANCE OF DEATH,"This is Salome, in a western land,"
1967,A DANCE OF DEATH,"An exile with Herodias, her mother,"
1968,A DANCE OF DEATH,With Herod and Herodias:
1969,A DANCE OF DEATH,"And she has sought the river’s icy mass,"
1970,A DANCE OF DEATH,"Companioned by no other,"
1971,A DANCE OF DEATH,To dance upon the ice--each hand
1972,A DANCE OF DEATH,"Held, as a snow-bird’s wings,"
1973,A DANCE OF DEATH,In heavy poise.
1974,A DANCE OF DEATH,"Ecstatic, with no noise,"
1975,A DANCE OF DEATH,"Athwart the ice her dream, her spell she flings;"
1976,A DANCE OF DEATH,And Winter in a rapture of delight
1977,A DANCE OF DEATH,Flings up and down the spangles of her light.
1978,A DANCE OF DEATH,
1979,A DANCE OF DEATH,"Oh, hearken, hearken!... Ice and frost,"
1980,A DANCE OF DEATH,"From these cajoling motions freed,"
1981,A DANCE OF DEATH,Have straight given heed
1982,A DANCE OF DEATH,To Will more firm. In their obedience
1983,A DANCE OF DEATH,Their masses dense
1984,A DANCE OF DEATH,Are riven as by a sword....
1985,A DANCE OF DEATH,Where is the Vision by the snow adored?
1986,A DANCE OF DEATH,The Vision is no more
1987,A DANCE OF DEATH,Seen from the noontide shore.
1988,A DANCE OF DEATH,"Oh, fearful crash of thunder from the stream,"
1989,A DANCE OF DEATH,As there were thunder-clouds upon its wave!
1990,A DANCE OF DEATH,Could nothing save
1991,A DANCE OF DEATH,The dancer in the noontide beam?
1992,A DANCE OF DEATH,She is engulphed and all the dance is done.
1993,A DANCE OF DEATH,Bright leaps the noontide sun--
1994,A DANCE OF DEATH,"But stay, what leaps beneath it? A gold head,"
1995,A DANCE OF DEATH,That twinkles with its jewels bright
1996,A DANCE OF DEATH,As water-drops....
1997,A DANCE OF DEATH,"O murdered Baptist of the severed head,"
1998,A DANCE OF DEATH,"Her head was caught and girded tight,"
1999,A DANCE OF DEATH,"And severed by the ice-brook sword, and sped"
2000,A DANCE OF DEATH,In dance that never stops.
2001,A DANCE OF DEATH,It skims and hops
2002,A DANCE OF DEATH,"Across the ice that rasped it. Smooth and gay,"
2003,A DANCE OF DEATH,"And void of care,"
2004,A DANCE OF DEATH,It takes its sunny way:
2005,A DANCE OF DEATH,"But underneath the golden hair,"
2006,A DANCE OF DEATH,"And underneath those jewel-sparks,"
2007,A DANCE OF DEATH,Keen noontide marks
2008,A DANCE OF DEATH,A little face as grey as evening ice;
2009,A DANCE OF DEATH,"Lips, open in a scream no soul may hear"
2010,A DANCE OF DEATH,Eyes fixed as they beheld the silver plate
2011,A DANCE OF DEATH,That they at Macherontis once beheld;
2012,A DANCE OF DEATH,"While the hair trails, although so fleet and nice"
2013,A DANCE OF DEATH,The motion of the head as subjugate
2014,A DANCE OF DEATH,"To its own law: yet in the face what fear,"
2015,A DANCE OF DEATH,To what excess compelled!
2016,A DANCE OF DEATH,
2017,A DANCE OF DEATH,Salome’s head is dancing on the bright
2018,A DANCE OF DEATH,"And silver ice. O holy John, how still"
2019,A DANCE OF DEATH,"Was laid thy head upon the salver white,"
2020,A DANCE OF DEATH,When thou hadst done God’s Will!

2201,A LIGNO,One stood a leaf-stripped thing;
2202,A LIGNO,One had begun to fill
2203,A LIGNO,"With leaves from shoots unsealed,"
2204,A LIGNO,With purple flowers along the wood--
2205,A LIGNO,So those trees stood.
2206,A LIGNO,
2207,A LIGNO,One bore up a Form

2213,A LIGNO,And where the boughs most sullen hung
2214,A LIGNO,A crisped form swung.
2215,A LIGNO,
2216,A LIGNO,One the Tree of Life--
2217,A LIGNO,Both near Jerusalem--
2218,A LIGNO,And one of Death the Tree!
2219,A LIGNO,One bore a bitter strife;
2220,A LIGNO,A cry came from its stem:
2221,A LIGNO,“Thou hast forsaken Me!”
2222,A LIGNO,"The other heard no sound at all,"
2223,A LIGNO,Save a dumb fall.
2224,A LIGNO,
