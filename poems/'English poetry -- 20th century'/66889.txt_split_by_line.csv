188,I,
189,I,"Of the many young poets who gave their lives in the war, Isaac Rosenberg"
190,I,"was not the least gifted. Adverse circumstances, imperfect education,"
191,I,"want of opportunity, impeded and obscured his genius; but whatever"
192,I,"criticism be made of his poetry, its faults are plainly those of excess"
193,I,"rather than deficiency. His writing was often difficult and obscure,"
194,I,because he instinctively thought in images and did not sufficiently
195,I,"appreciate the limitations of language. Also, a continual fear of being"
196,I,empty or thin led him to an over-intricate complexity. But there was no
197,I,"incoherence in his mind. And the main object of these notes, beyond"
198,I,"recording the facts of his life, is to illustrate the growth and"
199,I,"workings of his mind from his own letters, which will be the best"
200,I,commentary on his poems.
201,I,
202,I,"I cannot precisely fix the date, but it must have been some time in"
203,I,"1912, when one morning there came to me a letter in an untidy hand from"
204,I,"an address in Whitechapel, enclosing some pages of verse on which"
205,I,"criticism was asked, and signed “Isaac Rosenberg.” It was impossible not"
206,I,to be struck by something unusual in the quality of the poems. Thoughts
207,I,"and emotions of no common nature struggled for expression, and at times"
208,I,there gushed forth a pure song which haunted the memory.
209,I,
210,I,"I answered at once, and the next day received another letter which told"
211,I,"me something about my unknown correspondent. In this letter, which, like"
212,I,"nearly all his letters, is undated, he wrote:"
213,I,
214,I,“I must thank you very much for your encouraging reply to my poetical
215,I,"efforts.... As you are kind enough to ask about myself, I am sending a"
216,I,sort of autobiography I wrote about a year ago.... You will see from
217,I,that that my circumstances have not been very favourable for artistic
218,I,"production; but generally I am optimistic, I suppose because I am young"
219,I,and do not properly realize the difficulties. I am now attending the
220,I,"Slade, being sent there by some wealthy Jews who are kindly interested"
221,I,"in me, and, of course, I spend most of my time drawing. I find writing"
222,I,"interferes with drawing a good deal, and is far more exhausting.”"
223,I,
224,I,"He went on to tell of his admirations, Rossetti coming first for him"
225,I,"among modern artists. He had seen very little of early Italian art, but"
226,I,divined that theirs was the type of art which he thought the only kind
227,I,worth having—“expression through passionate colour and definite
228,I,"design”—not “a moment frozen on to canvas,” but “the spontaneity of"
229,I,un-selfconscious and childlike nature—infinity of suggestion—that is as
230,I,much part and voice of the artist’s soul as the song to the bird.” As to
231,I,"modern poets, they were “difficult to get hold of” (their volumes being"
232,I,"expensive), but he had an immense admiration for Francis Thompson—“that"
233,I,is the sort of poetry that appeals most to me.” He had done nothing yet
234,I,in painting which he would care to show. He aspired to do imaginative
235,I,"work, but at present was practising portraiture, as it was necessary to"
236,I,earn a living.
237,I,
238,I,"At my invitation Rosenberg came to see me. Small in stature, dark,"
239,I,"bright-eyed, thoroughly Jewish in type, he seemed a boy with an unusual"
240,I,"mixture of self-reliance and modesty. Indeed, no one could have had a"
241,I,"more independent nature. Obviously sensitive, he was not touchy or"
242,I,"aggressive. Possessed of vivid enthusiasms, he was shy in speech. One"
243,I,found in talk how strangely little of second-hand (in one of his age)
244,I,"there was in his opinions, how fresh a mind he brought to what he saw"
245,I,and read. There was an odd kind of charm in his manner which came from
246,I,"his earnest, transparent sincerity."
247,I,
248,I,"The “sort of autobiography,” which I have never seen since I returned it"
249,I,"to him, and has perhaps been destroyed, was the story of a youth,"
250,I,"mentally ambitious, introspective, dissatisfied with his surroundings,"
251,I,consumed by secret desires for liberation and self-expression.
252,I,
253,I,The external facts of his life are briefly told. For these I am mainly
254,I,"indebted to his sister, Mrs. Wynick, whose devotion to her brother and"
255,I,his work was at all times unwearied. She gave much of a scanty
256,I,"leisure-time to typing copies of his poems, and many of them would have"
257,I,been lost but for her care in preserving them.
258,I,
259,I,"Isaac Rosenberg was born at Bristol on the 25th of November, 1890. When"
260,I,he was seven he came to London with his parents. The family settled in
261,I,the East End. The boy was sent to the Board School of St. George’s in
262,I,"the East, and afterwards to the Stepney Board School. From childhood he"
263,I,showed a natural gift both for drawing and for writing. While at the
264,I,Stepney school his promise appeared so remarkable that the headmaster
265,I,allowed him to spend all his time in these pursuits. Out of school he
266,I,would draw with chalks on the street pavement. Reading poetry was a
267,I,passion with him. At the age of fourteen he was reluctantly obliged to
268,I,leave school. His parents were poor; and though they took great pride in
269,I,"his gifts, he was one of a family of eight, and he must now earn his"
270,I,"living. He was apprenticed, therefore, to the firm of Carl Hentschel, in"
271,I,Fleet Street. A trade connected with art was chosen for him as a
272,I,"stepping-stone to a painter’s career, and as something to fall back upon"
273,I,"in case his resources failed him. But he hated trade, and felt in"
274,I,bondage. In his meal-times he consoled himself by writing poems; in the
275,I,evenings he went to classes at the Art School of Birkbeck College. He
276,I,"worked hard and won many prizes. Mr. Frank Emanuel, the painter, who"
277,I,"befriended and encouraged him at this time, describes him as having been"
278,I,made “bitter and despondent by his circumstances”; and his letters
279,I,reveal fits of the deepest dejection against which his will contended.
280,I,
281,I,The uncongenial work came at last to an end. The sense of liberation was
282,I,"at first intoxicating. Yet work had to be found, and Isaac was"
283,I,determined to pursue art and nothing else. He met at first with
284,I,"disappointment, and endured many privations. But before long he found"
285,I,"good friends. Mr. Amschewitz, an artist, and Mr. Samuels warmly"
286,I,interested themselves in his behalf. Through them he made the
287,I,"acquaintance of three ladies, Mrs. Josephs, Mrs. Herbert Cohen, and Mrs."
288,I,"Lowy, who undertook to provide the means for his training at the Slade"
289,I,School.
290,I,
291,I,Through Mr. Emanuel’s friendship he had become a member of “The
292,I,"Limners,” a club of artists and art teachers, which met at Mr. Emanuel’s"
293,I,studio. Here he had the opportunity of meeting other artists and
294,I,"exchanging ideas. Prizes were given, which young Rosenberg occasionally"
295,I,"won. In spite, therefore, of his poverty and unpropitious surroundings,"
296,I,"he had now won sympathetic friends, and received both encouragement and"
297,I,material help from discerning compatriots. But with his sensitive
298,I,"artist’s pride and jealous independence of spirit, he was not always"
299,I,"easy to understand; and those who, with the sole desire to help him,"
300,I,advanced his circumstances sometimes felt that their efforts did not
301,I,seem to be appreciated. The case is not unfamiliar to readers of
302,I,artists’ biographies.
303,I,
304,I,"Rosenberg went to the Slade School in October, 1911, and remained till"
305,I,"March, 1914. He won prizes at the school and praise from his teachers."
306,I,"Thrown among contemporaries, all occupied with the problems of art and"
307,I,"the discussion of them, he became tinged with the temper and the"
308,I,"prevalent ideas of his own generation of students. His natural bent, I"
309,I,"think, was in another direction. He showed me drawings and studies from"
310,I,"time to time, and I saw a few of his paintings when they were exhibited"
311,I,"one summer at the Whitechapel Gallery. He was full of ideas, was a"
312,I,"capable draughtsman, and could conceive an interesting design. Yet, to"
313,I,"judge from what I have seen of his work, it did not seem to be for him"
314,I,the inevitable means of expression. He once showed me at his studio a
315,I,"large, ambitious composition—an oil-painting—which I fancy was never"
316,I,"completed. I cannot recall the nominal subject, but it was saturated"
317,I,with symbolism and required a good deal of explanation. I liked the
318,I,"mysteriousness of it, and the ideas which inspired the painting had"
319,I,suggested figures and groups and visionary glimpses of landscape which
320,I,"had passages of real beauty, though the whole work had grown impossibly"
321,I,complex with its convolutions of symbolic meaning. It reminded me of his
322,I,poetry; and I think that represented his natural bent in art. Had he
323,I,"been born half a century earlier, he would have been an ardent disciple"
324,I,of Rossetti. But he could not escape from the mental atmosphere of his
325,I,"own generation, in which so “literary” a conception of painting was"
326,I,"bound to wither in discouragement. Later, he showed me some studies of"
327,I,landscape and portrait which he had made in South Africa. These were in
328,I,"a more “modern” vein of realism, but they seemed to fail in the quality"
329,I,"of force, to which all other qualities had been, in intention,"
330,I,sacrificed. They had no personal savour. Like every generous and
331,I,"ambitious youth, Rosenberg wished his own generation to do glorious"
332,I,"things, and wished to belong to it as a comrade. Whether he would have"
333,I,emerged and found himself as a painter is a doubtful conjecture. I think
334,I,it possible that he would have abandoned painting. For his true vocation
335,I,"was poetry, and he thought of himself as a poet rather than as a"
336,I,painter.
337,I,
338,I,"He had begun to write verse at a very early age. Mr. Morley Dainow, who"
339,I,"was at the time librarian in the Whitechapel Public Library, was"
340,I,approached one day by a Jewish girl who wanted advice and help for her
341,I,"young brother. His aim in life, she said, was to be a poet. The next day"
342,I,the boy was brought to the library. Isaac then seemed to be between ten
343,I,and twelve years of age. He had already determined to be a poet and a
344,I,"painter. He interested and impressed Mr. Dainow, and in return for his"
345,I,friendly encouragement sent him a poem called “David’s Harp.” These are
346,I,the earliest verses of Rosenberg’s that Mr. Bottomley or I have seen.
347,I,"They are not printed in this book, but they are interesting because they"
348,I,"show how, even as a young boy, Rosenberg cherished the traditions of his"
349,I,race and aspired to become a representative poet of his own nation.
350,I,Moses and Judas Maccabæus were intended to be themes of his maturer
351,I,"poetry. “David’s Harp” is in fluent stanzas, and shows the passing"
352,I,influence of Byron.
353,I,
354,I,"The pamphlet called “Night and Day,” printed in 1912, contains probably"
355,I,"all that Rosenberg cared to preserve of his early verse, though no doubt"
356,I,it represented but a small selection from what he had written.
357,I,
358,I,"After leaving the Slade School, he found himself faced with a harder"
359,I,struggle than ever. But he never admitted defeat. He sold a few pictures
360,I,"and got a few poems into print, but his health was now a cause for"
361,I,"anxiety. His lungs were thought to be affected, and he was advised to"
362,I,"try a warmer climate. Having a married sister in Cape Town, he thought"
363,I,"of South Africa, and in June, 1914, he sailed for the Cape. Here he made"
364,I,"one or two friends, painted some pictures, taught a little, gave a few"
365,I,"lectures, and published some poems and articles. But the visit was not a"
366,I,"material success, and he returned disappointed and despondent. Soon"
367,I,"after his return, in 1915, he printed a second pamphlet of verse,"
368,I,"“Youth.” But he was restless and unhappy, and could not work. It was now"
369,I,that he enlisted in the Army. From this date onward he had practically
370,I,"no time for painting, but he continued to write till the end. “Moses”"
371,I,"was printed in 1916. He was first in a Bantam regiment, then in the"
372,I,"King’s Own Royal Lancasters, and after a period of training at Bury St."
373,I,"Edmunds and at Farnborough went out, early in 1916, to France. No one"
374,I,could have been less fitted for a military life. He suffered not only
375,I,"from physical disability, bad health, and sensitiveness, but from the"
376,I,absent-mindedness of one whose imagination was possessed by his poetic
377,I,"schemes. “My mind will not relinquish its poetical yearnings,” he wrote,"
378,I,“and concentration on alien things and dull has strained my memory.” But
379,I,he endured the inhuman horror of modern war with a great heart; he would
380,I,"not have liked to be called a hero, but his fortitude was truly heroic."
381,I,"On the first of April, 1918, he was killed in action."
382,I,
383,I,
384,II,II
385,II,
386,II,The poems collected in this volume speak for themselves. The
387,II,"obscurities, the straining and tormenting of language in the effort to"
388,II,"find right expression, the immaturities of style and taste, are apparent"
389,II,on the surface. The imaginative conceptions and the frequent gleam of
390,II,imaginative phrasing should be equally apparent. But what does not
391,II,"appear on the surface is the fine intention, the ardent toil, and the"
392,II,"continual self-criticism which underlay his work. Rosenberg’s aim was,"
393,II,"in his own words, a kind of poetry “where an interesting complexity of"
394,II,thought is kept in tone and right value to the dominating idea so that
395,II,it is understandable and still ungraspable.” The sentence occurs in one
396,II,"of his letters, and from this point on I wish to let Rosenberg speak for"
397,II,"himself. His letters give a picture both of his mind and character, far"
398,II,more vivid than anything one could write about him. He very rarely dated
399,II,"a letter, but the address and internal evidence give a clue to the date."
400,II,"The first extract is from a letter written, while he was still an"
401,II,"apprentice, to Miss Winifreda Seaton, a friend to whom Mr. Amschewitz"
402,II,"introduced him. Miss Seaton lent him books, encouraged him to write,"
403,II,"discussed art and literature with him, and criticized his poems."
404,II,
405,II,
406,II,"“It is horrible to think that all these hours, when my days are full of"
407,II,"vigour and my hands and soul craving for self-expression, I am bound,"
408,II,"chained to this fiendish mangling-machine, without hope and almost"
409,II,"desire of deliverance, and the days of youth go by.... I have tried to"
410,II,"make some sort of self-adjustment to circumstances by saying, ‘It is all"
411,II,"_experience_’; but, good God! it is _all_ experience, and nothing"
412,II,else.... I really would like to take up painting seriously; I think I
413,II,might do something at that; but poetry—I despair of ever writing
414,II,"excellent poetry. I can’t look at things in the simple, large way that"
415,II,"great poets do. My mind is so cramped and dulled and fevered, there is"
416,II,"no consistency of purpose, no oneness of aim; the very fibres are torn"
417,II,"apart, and application deadened by the fiendish persistence of the coil"
418,II,of circumstance.”
419,II,
420,II,
421,II,At last the apprenticeship is over and Rosenberg writes[1] exulting:
422,II,
423,II,
424,II,"“Congratulate me! I’ve cleared out of the —— shop, I hope for good and"
425,II,"all. I’m free—free to do anything, hang myself or anything except"
426,II,"work.... I’m very optimistic, now that I don’t know what to do, and"
427,II,everything seems topsy-turvy.”
428,II,
429,II,
430,II,Footnote 1:
431,II,
432,II,This and the following extracts are from letters to the same
433,II,correspondent.
434,II,
435,II,A little later comes the reaction:
436,II,
437,II,
438,II,"“I am out of work. I doubt if I feel the better for it, much as the work"
439,II,"was distasteful, though I expect it’s the hankering thought of the"
440,II,"consequences, pecuniary, etc., that bothers me.... All one’s thoughts"
441,II,"seem to revolve round to one point—death. It is horrible, especially at"
442,II,"night, ‘in the silence of the midnight’; it seems to clutch at your"
443,II,"thought—you can’t breathe. Oh, I think, work, work, any work, only to"
444,II,stop one thinking.”
445,II,
446,II,
447,II,But such moods are resisted. At another time he is writing:
448,II,
449,II,
450,II,"“One conceives one’s lot (I suppose it’s the same with all people, no"
451,II,matter what their condition) to be terribly tragic. You are the victim
452,II,of a horrible conspiracy; everything is unfair. The gods have either
453,II,forgotten you or made you a sort of scapegoat to bear all the
454,II,"punishment. I believe, however hard one’s lot is, one ought to try and"
455,II,accommodate oneself to the conditions; and except in a case of purely
456,II,"physical pain, I think it can be done. Why not make the very utmost of"
457,II,our lives?... I’m a practical economist in this respect. I endeavour to
458,II,waste nothing.... Waste words! Not to talk is to waste words....
459,II,
460,II,“To most people life is a musical instrument on which they are unable to
461,II,play: but in the musician’s hands it becomes a living thing.... The
462,II,"artist can see beauty everywhere, anywhere....”"
463,II,
464,II,
465,II,In what is perhaps an earlier letter he excuses his neglect of serious
466,II,reading by his lack of leisure and the worries that make him crave for
467,II,amusing books as an antidote:
468,II,
469,II,
470,II,"“You mustn’t forget the circumstances I have been brought up in, the"
471,II,"little education I have had. Nobody ever told me what to read, or ever"
472,II,put poetry in my way. I don’t think I knew what real poetry was till I
473,II,"read Keats a couple of years ago. True, I galloped through Byron when I"
474,II,"was about fourteen, but I fancy I read him more for the story than for"
475,II,"the poetry. I used to try to imitate him. Anyway, if I didn’t quite take"
476,II,"to Donne at first, you understand why. Poetical appreciation is only"
477,II,newly bursting on me. I always enjoyed Shelley and Keats. The ‘Hyperion’
478,II,ravished me....
479,II,
480,II,“Whenever I read anything in a great man’s life that pulls him down to
481,II,"me, my heart always pleads for him, and my mind pictures extenuating"
482,II,circumstances.

487,II,"but is full of poetry or comic within? My Hood is like that, and, I am"

496,II,"know more, and none other. I suppose we are all influenced by everybody"
497,II,"we come in contact with, in a subconscious way, if not direct, and"

502,II,"metaphorically, as distinguishing between obvious experiences and the"
503,II,"almost imperceptible. I still have no work to do. I think, if nothing"
504,II,"turns up here, I will go to Africa. I could not endure to live upon my"
505,II,people; and up till now I have been giving them from what I had managed
506,II,"to save up when I was at work. It is nearly run out now, and if I am to"
507,II,"do nothing, I would rather do it somewhere else. Besides, I feel so"

520,II,"blending. It seemed to draw the sky down, the whole spirit out of me; it"
521,II,"was articulate feeling. The inexpressible in poetry, in painting, was"
522,II,"there expressed. But I have not heard much, and the sensation that gave"

913,II,value his criticisms. I think anybody can pick holes and find unsound
914,II,parts in any work of art; anyone can say Christ’s creed is a slave’s
915,II,"creed, the Mosaic is a vindictive, savage creed, and so on. It is the"
916,II,"unique and superior, the illuminating qualities one wants to"
917,II,find—discover the direction of the impulse. Whatever anybody thinks of a
918,II,poet he will always know himself: he knows that the most marvellously
919,II,expressed idea is still nothing; and it is stupid to think that praise
920,II,can do him harm. I know sometimes one cannot exactly define one’s
921,II,feelings nor explain reasons for liking and disliking; but there is then
922,II,the right of a suspicion that the thing has not been properly understood
923,II,"or one is prejudiced. It is much my fault if I am not understood, I"
924,II,know; but I also feel a kind of injustice if my idea is not grasped and
925,II,"is ignored, and only petty cavilling at form, which I had known all"
926,II,"along was so, is continually knocked into me. I feel quite sure that"
927,II,"form is only a question of time. I am afraid I am more rude than ever,"
928,II,but I have exaggerated here the difference between your criticisms and
929,II,——’s. Ideas of poetry can be very different too. Tennyson thought Burns’
930,II,"love-songs important, but the ‘Cottar’s S. N.’ poor. Wordsworth thought"
931,II,the opposite.”

956,II,choice of a word or the failure to introduce a word that would flash my
957,II,"idea plain, as it is to my own mind. I believe my Amazon poem to be my"
958,II,"best poem. If there is any difficulty, it must be in words here and"
959,II,"there, the changing or elimination of which may make the poem clear. It"
960,II,has taken me about a year to write; for I have changed and rechanged it

962,II,inexorableness the human (or unhuman) side of this war has. It even

1277,MOSES,
1278,MESSENGER,MESSENGER
1279,MESSENGER,
1280,MESSENGER,[_Handing papyrus._] Pharaoh’s desires.
1281,MESSENGER,
1282,MOSES,MOSES
1283,MOSES,
1284,MOSES,"[_Reads._] To our beloved son, greeting. Add to our thoughts of you, if"
1285,MOSES,"possible to add, but a little, and you are more than old heroes—not to"
1286,MOSES,"bemean your genius, who might cry “Was that all!” We pile barriers"
1287,MOSES,"everywhere: we give you idiots for tools, tree stumps for swords, skin"
1288,MOSES,sacks for souls. The sixteenth pyramid remains to be built: we give you
1289,MOSES,the last draft of slaves. Move! Forget not the edict. PHARAOH.
1290,MOSES,
1291,MOSES,MOSES
1292,MOSES,
1293,MOSES,[_To_ MESSENGER.] What is the edict?
1294,MOSES,
1295,MESSENGER,MESSENGER
1296,MESSENGER,
1297,MESSENGER,"The royal paunch of Pharaoh dangled worriedly,"
1298,MESSENGER,Not knowing where the wrong: viands once giant-like
1299,MESSENGER,Came to him thin and thinner—what rats gnawed?
1300,MESSENGER,"Horror, the swarm of slaves! The satraps swore"
1301,MESSENGER,"Their wives’ bones hurt them when they lay abed,"
1302,MESSENGER,That before were soft and plump: the people howled
1303,MESSENGER,"They’d boil the slaves three days to get their fat,"
1304,MESSENGER,Ending the famine. A haggard council held
1305,MESSENGER,"Decrees the two hind molars, those two staunchest"
1306,MESSENGER,"Busy labourers in the belly’s service, to be drawn"
1307,MESSENGER,"From out each slave’s greased mouth, which soon"
1308,MESSENGER,From incapacity will lose the habit
1309,MESSENGER,Of eating.
1310,MESSENGER,
1311,MOSES,MOSES
1312,MOSES,
1313,MOSES,"Well, should their bones stick out to find the air,"
1314,MOSES,I’ll make a use of them for pleasantness—
1315,MOSES,Droll demonstrations of anatomy.
1316,MOSES,
1317,MESSENGER,MESSENGER
1318,MESSENGER,
1319,MESSENGER,And when you’ve ended find ’twas one on sharks.
1320,MESSENGER,

1323,MESSENGER,
1324,MOSES,MOSES
1325,MOSES,
1326,MOSES,Fine! Fine!
1327,MOSES,"See, in my brain"
1328,MOSES,What madmen have rushed through
1329,MOSES,And like a tornado
1330,MOSES,Torn up the tight roots
1331,MOSES,Of some dead universe:
1332,MOSES,The old clay is broken
1333,MOSES,For a power to soak in and knit
1334,MOSES,It all into tougher tissues
1335,MOSES,To hold life;
1336,MOSES,Pricking my nerves till the brain might crack
1337,MOSES,"It boils to my finger-tips,"
1338,MOSES,Till my hands ache to grip
1339,MOSES,The hammer—the lone hammer
1340,MOSES,That breaks lives into a road
1341,MOSES,Through which my genius drives.
1342,MOSES,"Pharaoh well peruked and oiled,"
1343,MOSES,"And your admirable pyramids,"
1344,MOSES,And your interminable procession
1345,MOSES,"Of crowded kings,"
1346,MOSES,You are my little fishing rods
1347,MOSES,Wherewith I catch the fish
1348,MOSES,To suit my hungry belly.
1349,MOSES,"I am rough now, and new, and will have no tailor."
1350,MOSES,"Startlingly,"
1351,MOSES,As a mountain-side
1352,MOSES,Wakes aware of its other side
1353,MOSES,"When from a cave a leopard comes,"
1354,MOSES,"On its heels the same red sand,"
1355,MOSES,"Springing with acquainted air,"
1356,MOSES,Sprang an intelligence
1357,MOSES,"Coloured as a whim of mine,"
1358,MOSES,Showed to my dull outer eyes
1359,MOSES,The living eyes underneath.
1360,MOSES,"Did I not shrivel up and take the place of air,"
1361,MOSES,"Secret as those eyes were,"
1362,MOSES,And those strong eyes call up a giant frame?
1363,MOSES,And I am that now.
1364,MOSES,
1365,MOSES,Pharaoh is sleek and deep;
1366,MOSES,And where his love for me is set—under
1367,MOSES,"The deeps, on their floor, or in the shallow ways,"
1368,MOSES,Though I have been as a diver—never yet
1369,MOSES,"Could I find.... I have a way, a touchstone!"
1370,MOSES,"A small misdemeanour, touch of rebelliousness;"
1371,MOSES,"To prick the vein of father, monitor, foe,"
1372,MOSES,Will tell which of these his kingship is.
1373,MOSES,"If I shut my eyes to the edict,"
1374,MOSES,And leave the pincers to rust
1375,MOSES,"And the slaves’ teeth as God made them,"
1376,MOSES,"Then hide from the summoning tribunal,"
1377,MOSES,Pharaoh will speak; and I’ll seize that word to act.
1378,MOSES,Should the word be a foe’s I can use it well
1379,MOSES,As a poison to soak into Egypt’s bowels;
1380,MOSES,A wraith from old Nile will cry
1381,MOSES,“For his mercy they break his back”
1382,MOSES,"And I shall have a great following for this,"
1383,MOSES,"The rude, touched heart of the mauled, sweaty horde,"
1384,MOSES,"Their rough tongues fawn at my hands, their red-streaked eyes"
1385,MOSES,Glitter with sacrifice. Well! Pharaoh bids me act....
1386,MOSES,"Hah! I’m all a-bristle.... Lord, his eyes would go wide"
1387,MOSES,If he knew the road my rampant dreams would race!
1388,MOSES,"I am too much awake now—restless, so restless."
1389,MOSES,Behind white mists invisibly
1390,MOSES,My thoughts stood like a mountain;
1391,MOSES,"But Power, watching as a man,"
1392,MOSES,Saw no mountain there—
1393,MOSES,Only the mixing mist and sky
1394,MOSES,And the flat earth.
1395,MOSES,What shoulder pushed through those mists
1396,MOSES,Of gay fantastic pastimes
1397,MOSES,And startled hills of sleep?
1398,MOSES,
1399,MOSES,[_He looks in a mirror._]
1400,MOSES,
1401,MOSES,"Oh, apparition of me,"
1402,MOSES,"Ruddy flesh soon hueless,"
1403,MOSES,Fade and show to my eyes
1404,MOSES,The lasting bare body;
1405,MOSES,Soul-sack fall away
1406,MOSES,And show what you hold!
1407,MOSES,Sing! Let me hear you sing.
1408,MOSES,
1409,A VOICE,A VOICE
1410,A VOICE,
1411,A VOICE,[_Sings._]
1412,A VOICE,
1413,A VOICE,"Upon my lips, like a cloud"
1414,A VOICE,"To burst on the peaks of light,"
1415,A VOICE,Sit cowled impossible things
1416,A VOICE,To tie my hands at their prime and height.
1417,A VOICE,"Power, break through their shroud;"
1418,A VOICE,"Pierce them so thoroughly,"
1419,A VOICE,"Thoroughly enter me,"
1420,A VOICE,Know me for one dead;
1421,A VOICE,"Break the shadowy thread,"
1422,A VOICE,The cowering spirit’s bond
1423,A VOICE,Writ by illusions blond!
1424,A VOICE,
1425,A VOICE,Ah! Let the morning pale
1426,A VOICE,Throb with a wilder pulse:
1427,A VOICE,No delicate flame shall quail
1428,A VOICE,With terror at your convulse.
1429,A VOICE,Thin branches whip the white skies
1430,A VOICE,To lips and spaces of song
1431,A VOICE,That chant a mood to my eyes....
1432,A VOICE,Ah! Sleep can be overlong.
1433,A VOICE,
1434,MOSES,MOSES
1435,MOSES,
1436,MOSES,"Voices thunder, voices of deeds not done:"
1437,MOSES,"Lo, on the air are scrawled in abysmal light"
1438,MOSES,"Old myths never known and yet already forgone,"
1439,MOSES,"And songs more lost, more secret than desert light:"
1440,MOSES,"Martyrdoms of uncreated things,"
1441,MOSES,Virgin silences waiting a breaking voice—
1442,MOSES,"As in a womb they cry, in a cage beat vain wings"
1443,MOSES,"Under life, over life: is their unbeing my choice?"
1444,MOSES,
1445,MOSES,Dull wine of torpor—the unsoldered spirit lies limp.
1446,MOSES,"Ah! If she would run into a mould,"
1447,MOSES,Some new idea unwalled
1448,MOSES,"To human by-ways, an apocalyptic camp"
1449,MOSES,"Of utterest and ulterior dreaming,"
1450,MOSES,"Understood only in its gleaming,"
1451,MOSES,To flash stark naked the whole girth of the world.
1452,MOSES,
1453,MOSES,"I am sick of priests and forms,"
1454,MOSES,This rigid dry-boned refinement:
1455,MOSES,As ladies’ perfumes are
1456,MOSES,"Obnoxious to stern natures,"
1457,MOSES,This miasma of a rotting god
1458,MOSES,Is to me.
1459,MOSES,Who has made of the forest a park?
1460,MOSES,Who has changed the wolf to a dog?
1461,MOSES,And put the horse in harness?
1462,MOSES,And man’s mind in a groove?
1463,MOSES,
1464,MOSES,"I heard the one spirit cry in them,"
1465,MOSES,"“Break this metamorphosis,"
1466,MOSES,Disenchant my lying body;
1467,MOSES,"Only putrefaction is free,"
1468,MOSES,"And I, Freedom, am not."
1469,MOSES,"Moses! Touch us, thou!”"
1470,MOSES,
1471,MOSES,"There shall not be a void or calm,"
1472,MOSES,But a fury fill the veins of time—
1473,MOSES,"Whose limbs had begun to rot,"
1474,MOSES,Who had flattered my stupid torpor
1475,MOSES,"With an easy and mimic energy,"
1476,MOSES,And drained my veins with a paltry marvel
1477,MOSES,More monstrous than battle;
1478,MOSES,For the soul ached and went out dead in pleasure.
1479,MOSES,
1480,MOSES,Is not this song still sung in the streets of me?
1481,MOSES,
1482,MOSES,A naked African
1483,MOSES,Walked in the sun
1484,MOSES,Singing—singing
1485,MOSES,Of his wild love.
1486,MOSES,
1487,MOSES,I slew the tiger
1488,MOSES,With your young strength
1489,MOSES,(My tawny panther)
1490,MOSES,Rolled round my life.
1491,MOSES,
1492,MOSES,"Three sheep, your breasts"
1493,MOSES,"And my head between,"
1494,MOSES,Grazing together
1495,MOSES,On a smooth slope.
1496,MOSES,
1497,MOSES,Ah! Koelue!
1498,MOSES,"Had you embalmed your beauty, so"
1499,MOSES,It could not backward go
1500,MOSES,"Or change in any way,"
1501,MOSES,What were the use if on my eyes
1502,MOSES,The embalming spices were not laid
1503,MOSES,"To keep us fixed,"
1504,MOSES,Two amorous sculptures passioned endlessly?
1505,MOSES,What were the use if my sight grew
1506,MOSES,"And its far branches were cloud-hung,"
1507,MOSES,You small at the roots like grass;
1508,MOSES,While the new lips my spirit would kiss
1509,MOSES,"Were not red lips of flesh,"
1510,MOSES,But the huge kiss of power?
1511,MOSES,Where yesterday soft hair through my fingers fell
1512,MOSES,A shaggy mane would entwine;
1513,MOSES,"And no slim form work fire to my thighs,"
1514,MOSES,But human Life’s inarticulate mass
1515,MOSES,Throb the pulse of a thing
1516,MOSES,Whose mountain flanks awry
1517,MOSES,Beg my mastery—mine!
1518,MOSES,Ah! I will ride the dizzy beast of the world
1519,MOSES,My road—my way.

1521,MOSES,
1522,MOSES,SCENE II.: _Evening before Thebes. The Pyramids are being built.
1523,MOSES,Swarms of Hebrews labouring. Priests and Taskmasters. Two Hebrews
1524,MOSES,are furtively talking._ KOELUE _passes by singing_.

1526,KOELUE,KOELUE
1527,KOELUE,
1528,KOELUE,The vague viols of evening
1529,KOELUE,Call all the flower clans
1530,KOELUE,To some abysmal swinging
1531,KOELUE,And tumult of deep trance;
1532,KOELUE,"He may hear, flower of my singing,"
1533,KOELUE,And come hither winging.

1538,OLD HEBREW,
1539,OLD HEBREW,Hateful harlot! Boils cover your small cruel face.
1540,OLD HEBREW,"O, fine champion Moses: O, so good to us:"
1541,OLD HEBREW,"O, grand begetter on her of a whip and a torturer,"
1542,OLD HEBREW,"Her father, born to us since you kissed her."
1543,OLD HEBREW,"Our champion, O so good to us!"

1546,YOUNG HEBREW,YOUNG HEBREW
1547,YOUNG HEBREW,
1548,YOUNG HEBREW,For shame! Our brothers’ twisted blood-smeared gums
1549,YOUNG HEBREW,Tell we only have more room for wreck curtailed:
1550,YOUNG HEBREW,"For you, having no teeth to draw, it is no mercy"
1551,YOUNG HEBREW,Perhaps; but they might mangle your gums
1552,YOUNG HEBREW,Or touch a nerve somewhere. He barred it now;
1553,YOUNG HEBREW,"And that is all his thanks, he, too, in peril."
1554,YOUNG HEBREW,"Be still, old man; wait a little."
1555,YOUNG HEBREW,
1556,OLD HEBREW,OLD HEBREW
1557,OLD HEBREW,
1558,OLD HEBREW,Wait!
1559,OLD HEBREW,All day some slow dark quadruped beats
1560,OLD HEBREW,To pulp our springiness:
1561,OLD HEBREW,"All day some hoofed animal treads our veins,"
1562,OLD HEBREW,Leisurely—leisurely our energies flow out:
1563,OLD HEBREW,All agonies created from the first day
1564,OLD HEBREW,"Have wandered hungry searching the world for us,"
1565,OLD HEBREW,Or they would perish like disused Behemoth.
1566,OLD HEBREW,Is our Messiah one to unleash these agonies
1567,OLD HEBREW,"As Moses does, who gives us an Abinoah?"
1568,OLD HEBREW,
1569,YOUNG HEBREW,YOUNG HEBREW
1570,YOUNG HEBREW,
1571,YOUNG HEBREW,Yesterday as I lay nigh dead with toil
1572,YOUNG HEBREW,"Underneath the hurtling crane oiled with our blood,"
1573,YOUNG HEBREW,
1574,YOUNG HEBREW,"Thinking to end all and let the crane crush me,"
1575,YOUNG HEBREW,He came by and bore me into the shade:
1576,YOUNG HEBREW,"O, what a furnace roaring in his blood"
1577,YOUNG HEBREW,Thawed my congealed sinews and tingled my own
1578,YOUNG HEBREW,Raging through me like a strong cordial.
1579,YOUNG HEBREW,He spoke! Since yesterday
1580,YOUNG HEBREW,Am I not larger grown?
1581,YOUNG HEBREW,"I’ve seen men hugely shapen in soul,"
1582,YOUNG HEBREW,Of such unhuman shaggy male turbulence
1583,YOUNG HEBREW,"They tower in foam miles from our neck-strained sight,"
1584,YOUNG HEBREW,And to their shop only heroes come;
1585,YOUNG HEBREW,But all were cripples to this speed
1586,YOUNG HEBREW,Constrained to the stables of flesh.
1587,YOUNG HEBREW,I say there is a famine in ripe harvest
1588,YOUNG HEBREW,When hungry giants come as guests:
1589,YOUNG HEBREW,"Come knead the hills and ocean into food,"
1590,YOUNG HEBREW,There is none for him.
1591,YOUNG HEBREW,The streaming vigours of his blood erupting
1592,YOUNG HEBREW,From his halt tongue are like an anger thrust
1593,YOUNG HEBREW,Out of a madman’s piteous craving for
1594,YOUNG HEBREW,A monstrous balked perfection.
1595,YOUNG HEBREW,
1596,OLD HEBREW,OLD HEBREW
1597,OLD HEBREW,
1598,OLD HEBREW,"He is a prince, an animal"
1599,OLD HEBREW,Not of our kind; who perhaps has heard
1600,OLD HEBREW,
1601,OLD HEBREW,"Vague rumours of our world, to his mind"
1602,OLD HEBREW,An unpleasant miasma.
1603,OLD HEBREW,
1604,YOUNG HEBREW,YOUNG HEBREW
1605,YOUNG HEBREW,
1606,YOUNG HEBREW,"Is not Miriam his sister, Jochabed his mother?"
1607,YOUNG HEBREW,In the womb he looked round and saw
1608,YOUNG HEBREW,From furthermost stretches our wrong:
1609,YOUNG HEBREW,From the palaces and schools
1610,YOUNG HEBREW,Our pain has pierced dead generations
1611,YOUNG HEBREW,Back to his blood’s thin source.
1612,YOUNG HEBREW,As we lie chained by Egyptian men
1613,YOUNG HEBREW,"He lay in nets of their women,"
1614,YOUNG HEBREW,And now rejoices he has broken their meshes.
1615,YOUNG HEBREW,O! His desires are fleets of treasure
1616,YOUNG HEBREW,"He has squandered in treacherous seas,"
1617,YOUNG HEBREW,Sailing mistrust to find frank ports;
1618,YOUNG HEBREW,He fears our fear and tampers mildly
1619,YOUNG HEBREW,For our assent to let him save us.
1620,YOUNG HEBREW,When he walks amid our toil
1621,YOUNG HEBREW,With some master-mason
1622,YOUNG HEBREW,"His tense brows, critical"
1623,YOUNG HEBREW,"Of the loose enginery,"
1624,YOUNG HEBREW,"Hint famed devices flat, his rod"
1625,YOUNG HEBREW,Scratching new schemes on the sand:
1626,YOUNG HEBREW,But read hard the scrawled lines there—
1627,YOUNG HEBREW,"Limned turrets and darkness, chinks of light,"
1628,YOUNG HEBREW,
1629,YOUNG HEBREW,"Half beasts snorting into the light,"
1630,YOUNG HEBREW,"A phantasmagoria, wild escapade"
1631,YOUNG HEBREW,To our hearts’ clue; just a daring plan
1632,YOUNG HEBREW,To the honest mason. What swathed meanings peer
1633,YOUNG HEBREW,"From his work-a-day council, washed to and from"
1634,YOUNG HEBREW,Your understanding till you doubt
1635,YOUNG HEBREW,That a word was said—
1636,YOUNG HEBREW,But a terror wakes and forces your eyes
1637,YOUNG HEBREW,"Into his covertly, to search his searching;"
1638,YOUNG HEBREW,"Startled to life, starved hopes slink out"
1639,YOUNG HEBREW,"Cowering, incredulous."
1640,YOUNG HEBREW,
1641,OLD HEBREW,OLD HEBREW

1646,OLD HEBREW,
1647,OLD HEBREW,"I am broken and grey, have seen much in my time,"
1648,OLD HEBREW,And all this gay grotesque of childish man
1649,OLD HEBREW,"Long passed; half blind, half deaf, I only grumble"
1650,OLD HEBREW,I am not blind or deaf enough for peace.
1651,OLD HEBREW,I have seen splendid young fools cheat themselves
1652,OLD HEBREW,Into a prophet’s frenzy; I have seen
1653,OLD HEBREW,"So many crazed shadows puffed away,"
1654,OLD HEBREW,And conscious cheats with such an ache for fame
1655,OLD HEBREW,
1656,OLD HEBREW,They’d make a bonfire of themselves to be
1657,OLD HEBREW,"Mouthed in the squares, broad in the public eye:"
1658,OLD HEBREW,"And whose backs break, whose lives are mauled, after"
1659,OLD HEBREW,It all falls flat? His tender airs chill me—
1660,OLD HEBREW,As thoughts of sleep to a man tiptoed night-long
1661,OLD HEBREW,"Roped round his neck, for sleep means death to him."
1662,OLD HEBREW,"Oh, he is kind to us!"
1663,OLD HEBREW,Your safe teeth chatter when they hear a step:
1664,OLD HEBREW,He left them yours because his cunning way
1665,OLD HEBREW,Would brag the wrong against his humane act
1666,OLD HEBREW,By Pharaoh; so gain more favour than he lost.
1667,OLD HEBREW,
1668,YOUNG HEBREW,YOUNG HEBREW
1669,YOUNG HEBREW,
1670,YOUNG HEBREW,"Help him not then, and push your safety away:"
1671,YOUNG HEBREW,"I for my part will be his backward eye,"
1672,YOUNG HEBREW,His hands when they are shut. Ah! Abinoah!
1673,YOUNG HEBREW,Like a bad smell from the soul of Moses dipt
1674,YOUNG HEBREW,In the mire of lust he hangs round him;
1675,YOUNG HEBREW,And if his slit-like eyes could tear right out
1676,YOUNG HEBREW,"The pleasure Moses on his daughter had,"
1677,YOUNG HEBREW,She’d be as virgin as ere she came nestling
1678,YOUNG HEBREW,"Into that fierce unmanageable blood,"
1679,YOUNG HEBREW,"Flying from her loathed father. O, that slave"
1680,YOUNG HEBREW,Has hammered from the anvil of her beauty
1681,YOUNG HEBREW,
1682,YOUNG HEBREW,A steel to break his manacles: hard for us
1683,YOUNG HEBREW,"Moses has made him overseer. O, his slits"
1684,YOUNG HEBREW,Pry—pry.... For what?... To sell to Imra....

1687,YOUNG HEBREW,
1688,YOUNG HEBREW,Sh! The thin-lipped abomination!
1689,YOUNG HEBREW,Zig-zagging haschish tours in a fine style:
1690,YOUNG HEBREW,"It were delightful labour making bricks,"
1691,YOUNG HEBREW,Knowing they would kiss friendly with his head.

2502,DEAD MAN’S DUMP,"So we crashed round the bend,"
2503,DEAD MAN’S DUMP,"We heard his weak scream,"
2504,DEAD MAN’S DUMP,"We heard his very last sound,"

2510,IN WAR,Fret the nonchalant noon
2511,IN WAR,With your spleen
2512,IN WAR,"Or your gay brow,"
2513,IN WAR,For the motion of your spirit
2514,IN WAR,Ever moves with these.
2515,IN WAR,
2516,IN WAR,"When day shall be too quiet,"
2517,IN WAR,Deaf to you
2518,IN WAR,"And your dumb smile,"
2519,IN WAR,Untuned air shall lap the stillness

2523,IN WAR,Remote depths
2524,IN WAR,"Of moving being,"

2526,IN WAR,Suddenly stilled for ever.

2528,IN WAR,No ghost darkens the places
2529,IN WAR,Dark to One;
2530,IN WAR,"But my eyes dream,"
2531,IN WAR,And my heart is heavy to think
2532,IN WAR,How it was heavy once.
2533,IN WAR,
2534,IN WAR,In the old days when death
2535,IN WAR,Stalked the world
2536,IN WAR,"For the flower of men,"
2537,IN WAR,And the rose of beauty faded
2538,IN WAR,"And pined in the great gloom,"
2539,IN WAR,
2540,IN WAR,One day we dug a grave:
2541,IN WAR,We were vexed
2542,IN WAR,With the sun’s heat.
2543,IN WAR,We scanned the hooded dead:
2544,IN WAR,At noon we sat and talked.
2545,IN WAR,
2546,IN WAR,How death had kissed their eyes
2547,IN WAR,"Three dread noons since,"
2548,IN WAR,How human art won
2549,IN WAR,The dark soul to flicker
2550,IN WAR,Till it was lost again:
2551,IN WAR,
2552,IN WAR,And we whom chance kept whole—
2553,IN WAR,"But haggard,"
2554,IN WAR,Spent—were charged
2555,IN WAR,To make a place for them who knew
2556,IN WAR,No pain in any place.
2557,IN WAR,
2558,IN WAR,The good priest came to pray;
2559,IN WAR,"Our ears half heard,"
2560,IN WAR,And half we thought
2561,IN WAR,"Of alien things, irrelevant;"
2562,IN WAR,And the heat and thirst were great.
2563,IN WAR,
2564,IN WAR,The good priest read: “I heard....”
2565,IN WAR,Dimly my brain
2566,IN WAR,Held words and lost....
2567,IN WAR,Sudden my blood ran cold....
2568,IN WAR,God! God! It could not be.
2569,IN WAR,
2570,IN WAR,He read my brother’s name;
2571,IN WAR,I sank—
2572,IN WAR,I clutched the priest.
2573,IN WAR,They did not tell me it was he
2574,IN WAR,Was killed three days ago.
2575,IN WAR,
2576,IN WAR,What are the great sceptred dooms
2577,IN WAR,"To us, caught"
2578,IN WAR,In the wild wave?
2579,IN WAR,"We break ourselves on them,"

2637,LILITH,"I’ll give you the strange man your father brought,"
2638,LILITH,And he will run with you upon his back to-day.
2639,LILITH,
2640,LILITH,Come from your father or you’ll get no cake;
2641,LILITH,He’s been a long journey.
2642,LILITH,Bring me the pictured book he brought for you.
2643,LILITH,What! Already cut to pieces?
2644,LILITH,"Put away that horn from your father’s ear,"

2654,AMAK,
2655,LILITH,LILITH
2656,LILITH,
2657,LILITH,It dances with my blood: when my eyes caught it first
2658,LILITH,"I was like lost, and yearned and yearned and yearned,"
2659,LILITH,And strained like iron to stay my head from falling
2660,LILITH,Upon that beggar’s breast where the jade stone hung.
2661,LILITH,Perhaps the spirit of Saul’s young love lies here
2662,LILITH,Strayed far and brought back by this stranger near.
2663,LILITH,Saul said his discourse was more deep than Heaven.
2664,LILITH,
2665,LILITH,For the storm trapped him ere he left the town
2666,LILITH,Loaded with our week’s victuals: the slime clung
2667,LILITH,And licked and clawed and chewed the clogged dragging wheels
2668,LILITH,"Till they sunk right to the axle: Saul, sodden and vexed,"
2669,LILITH,"Like fury smote the mules’ mouths, pulling but sweat"
2670,LILITH,"From his drowned hair and theirs, while the thunder knocked"
2671,LILITH,"And all the air yawned water, falling water,"
2672,LILITH,"And the light cart was water, like a wrecked raft,"
2673,LILITH,And all seemed like a forest under the ocean.
2674,LILITH,Sudden the lightning flashed upon a figure
2675,LILITH,"Moving as a man moves in the slipping mud,"
2676,LILITH,"Singing, but not as a man sings, through the storm,"
2677,LILITH,Which could not drown his sounds. Saul bawled “Hi! Hi!”
2678,LILITH,"And the man loomed, naked, vast, and gripped the wheels;"
2679,LILITH,Saul fiercely dug from under; he tugged the wheels;
2680,LILITH,"The mules foamed straining, straining."
2681,LILITH,Suddenly they went.
2682,LILITH,"Saul and the man leaped in: Saul, miserably sodden,"
2683,LILITH,
2684,LILITH,Marvelled at the large cheer in a naked glistening man;
2685,LILITH,"Yet soon fell in with that contented mood,"
2686,LILITH,That when our hut’s light broke on his new mind
2687,LILITH,He could not credit it—too soon it seemed:
2688,LILITH,The stranger man’s talk was witchery.
2689,LILITH,I pray his baking be as magical;
2690,LILITH,The cakes should be nigh burnt.

2704,LILITH,
2705,LILITH,"[_She looks curiously at him. He is an immense man with squat,"
2706,LILITH,"mule-skinned features: his jet-black curled beard, crisp hair,"
2707,LILITH,"glistening nude limbs, appear to her like some heathen idol of"
2708,LILITH,ancient stories._]
2709,LILITH,

2711,LILITH,[_She thinks to herself._]
2712,LILITH,
2713,LILITH,Out of the lightning
2714,LILITH,In a dizzying cloven wink
2715,LILITH,"This apparition stood up,"
2716,LILITH,"Of stricken trunk or beast’s spirit,"
2717,LILITH,Stirred by Saul’s blasphemies;
2718,LILITH,"So Saul’s heart feared, aghast."
2719,LILITH,"But lo, he touched the mischance and life ran straight!"
2720,LILITH,"Was it the storm-spirit, storm’s pilot,"
2721,LILITH,With all the heaving débris of Noah’s sunken days
2722,LILITH,Dragged on his loins;
2723,LILITH,Law’s spirit wandering to us
2724,LILITH,"Through Nature’s anarchy,"
2725,LILITH,Wandering towards us when the Titans yet were young?
2726,LILITH,Perhaps Moses and Buddha he met.
2727,LILITH,
2728,LILITH,[_She speaks aloud._]
2729,LILITH,
2730,LILITH,The shadow of these pomegranate boughs
2731,LILITH,Is sweet and restful; sit and ease your feet. Eat of these figs;
2732,LILITH,You have journeyed long.

2740,LILITH,
2741,LILITH,"You have seen men and women,"
2742,LILITH,"Soaked yourself in powers and old glories,"
2743,LILITH,"In broken days and tears and glees,"
2744,LILITH,And touched cold hands—
2745,LILITH,Hands shut in pitiless trances where the feast high.
2746,LILITH,I think there is more sorrow in the world
2747,LILITH,Than man can bear.
2748,LILITH,
2749,NUBIAN,NUBIAN
2750,NUBIAN,
2751,NUBIAN,"None can exceed their limit, lady:"

2754,LILITH,LILITH
2755,LILITH,
2756,LILITH,"Can one choose to break? To bear,"
2757,LILITH,"Wearily to bear, is misery."
2758,LILITH,Beauty is this corroding malady.
2759,LILITH,
2760,NUBIAN,NUBIAN
2761,NUBIAN,
2762,NUBIAN,Beauty is a great paradox—
2763,NUBIAN,Music’s secret soul creeping about the senses
2764,NUBIAN,To wrestle with man’s coarser nature.
2765,NUBIAN,It is hard when beauty loses.
2766,NUBIAN,
2767,NUBIAN,
2768,LILITH,LILITH
2769,LILITH,
2770,LILITH,I think beauty is a bad bargain made of life.
2771,LILITH,Men’s iron sinews hew them room in the world
2772,LILITH,And use deceits to gain them trophies:
2773,LILITH,"O, when our beauty fails us did we not use"
2774,LILITH,"Deceits, where were our room in the world—"
2775,LILITH,Only our room in the world?
2776,LILITH,Are not the songs and devices of men
2777,LILITH,"Moulds they have made after my scarlet mouth,"
2778,LILITH,Of cunning words and contours of bronze
2779,LILITH,And viols and gathered air?
2780,LILITH,They without song have sung me
2781,LILITH,Boldly and shamelessly.
2782,LILITH,"I am no wanton, no harlot;"
2783,LILITH,"I have been pleased and smiled my pleasure,"
2784,LILITH,I am a wife with a woman’s natural ways.
2785,LILITH,Yet through the shadow of the pomegranates
2786,LILITH,"Filters a poison day by day,"
2787,LILITH,And to a malady turns
2788,LILITH,"The blond, the ample music of my heart:"
2789,LILITH,Inward to eat my heart
2790,LILITH,My thoughts are worms that suck my softness all away.
2791,LILITH,I watch the dumb eyeless hours
2792,LILITH,"Drop their tears, then shapeless moaning drop."
2793,LILITH,
2794,LILITH,Unfathomable is my mouth’s dream
2795,LILITH,Do not men say?
2796,LILITH,"So secret are my far eyes,"
2797,LILITH,Weaving for iron men profound subtleties.
2798,LILITH,
2799,LILITH,Sorceress they name me;
2800,LILITH,"And my eyes harden, and they say,"
2801,LILITH,“How may those eyes know love
2802,LILITH,If God made her without a heart?
2803,LILITH,
2804,LILITH,"“Her tears, her moaning,"
2805,LILITH,"Her sad profound gaze,"
2806,LILITH,The dishevelled lustres of her hair
2807,LILITH,"Moon-storm like” they say,"
2808,LILITH,“These are her subtleties” men say.
2809,LILITH,"My husband sleeps,"
2810,LILITH,The ghosts of my virgin days do not trouble him:
2811,LILITH,"His sleep can be over-long,"
2812,LILITH,For there is that in my embers
2813,LILITH,"Pride and blushes of fire, the outraged blood,"
2814,LILITH,His sleep makes me remember.
2815,LILITH,
2816,LILITH,"Sleep, hairy hunter; sleep!"
2817,LILITH,"You are not hungry more,"
2818,LILITH,Having fed on my deliciousness;
2819,LILITH,"Your sleep is not adultery to me,"
2820,LILITH,
2821,LILITH,For you were wed to a girl
2822,LILITH,And I am a woman.
2823,LILITH,My lonely days are not whips to my honour.
2824,LILITH,

2835,NUBIAN,But tolerance is medicinal.
2836,NUBIAN,In all our textures are loosed
2837,NUBIAN,Pulses straining against strictness
2838,NUBIAN,Because an easy issue lies therefrom.
2839,NUBIAN,(Could they but slink past the hands holding whips
2840,NUBIAN,To hunt them from the human pale
2841,NUBIAN,Where is the accident to cover? Spite fears bias.)
2842,NUBIAN,I am justified at my heart’s plea;
2843,NUBIAN,He is justified also.
2844,NUBIAN,
2845,NUBIAN,For the eyes of vanity are sleepless—are suspicious.
2846,NUBIAN,Are mad with imaginings

2848,NUBIAN,

2853,NUBIAN,There is a crazed shadow from no golden body

2856,NUBIAN,"It mixes with all God-ancestralled essences,"
2857,NUBIAN,And twists the brain and heart.
2858,NUBIAN,"This shadow sits in the texture of Saul’s being,"
2859,NUBIAN,Mauling your love and beauty with its lies:
2860,NUBIAN,I hold a power like light to shrivel it—
2861,NUBIAN,"There, in your throat’s hollow—that green jade."

2867,NUBIAN,[_He mutters._] Lost—lost.
2868,NUBIAN,"The child has torn the scroll in it,"

2876,LILITH,[_She rises._]
2877,LILITH,
2878,LILITH,I will go now; prepare our evening meal;

2885,NUBIAN,"The dumb night’s lips are scared and wide,"
2886,NUBIAN,The world is reeling with sound:
2887,NUBIAN,"Was I deaf before, mute, tied?"
2888,NUBIAN,What shakes here from lustre-seeded pomegranates
2889,NUBIAN,"Not in the great world,"
2890,NUBIAN,More vast and terrible?
2891,NUBIAN,"What is this ecstasy in form,"
2892,NUBIAN,This lightning
2893,NUBIAN,"That found the lightning in my blood,"
2894,NUBIAN,Searing my spirit’s lips aghast and naked?
2895,NUBIAN,"I am flung in the abyss of days,"
2896,NUBIAN,And the void is filled with rushing sound
2897,NUBIAN,From pent eternities:
2898,NUBIAN,I am strewn as the cypher is strewn.
2899,NUBIAN,A woman—a soft woman!
2900,NUBIAN,Our girls have hair
2901,NUBIAN,"Like heights of night ringing with never-seen larks,"

2909,NUBIAN,Only thin golden tremors.
2910,NUBIAN,Light tender beast!
2911,NUBIAN,Your fragile gleaming wrists
2912,NUBIAN,"Have shaken the scaled glacier from under me,"
2913,NUBIAN,And bored into my craft

3369,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Of jagged warm lights on shrunk faces pale:
3370,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,I heard mad laughter as one hears in dreams
3371,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Or Hell’s harsh lurid tale.
3372,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,
3373,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"The traffic rolled,"
3374,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"A gliding chaos populous of din,"
3375,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,A steaming wail at doom the Lord had scrawled
3376,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,For perilous loads of sin.
3377,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,
3378,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,And my soul thought:
3379,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,“What fearful land have my steps wandered to?
3380,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"God’s love is everywhere, but here is naught"
3381,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Save love His anger slew.”
3382,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,
3383,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,And as I stood
3384,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"Lost in promiscuous bewilderment,"
3385,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"Which to my mazèd soul was wonder-food,"
3386,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,A girl in garments rent
3387,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,
3388,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Peered ’neath lids shamed
3389,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,And spoke to me and murmured to my blood.
3390,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"My soul stopped dead, and all my horror flamed"
3391,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,At her forgot of God.
3392,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,
3393,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"Her hungered eyes,"
3394,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"Craving and yet so sadly spiritual,"
3395,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Shone like the unsmirched corner of a jewel
3396,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Where else foul blemish lies.
3397,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,
3398,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,I walked with her
3399,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"Because my heart thought, “Here the soul is clean,"
3400,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,The fragrance of the frankincense and myrrh
3401,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Is lost in odours mean.”
3402,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,
3403,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,She told me how
3404,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,The shadow of black death had newly come
3405,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"And touched her father, mother, even now"
3406,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"Grim-hovering in her home,"
3407,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,
3408,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Where fevered lay
3409,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"Her wasting brother in a cold, bleak room,"
3410,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"Which theirs would be no longer than a day,"
3411,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,And then—the streets and doom.
3412,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,
3413,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Lord! Lord! Dear Lord!
3414,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"I knew that life was bitter, but my soul"
3415,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"Recoiled, as anguish-smitten by sharp sword,"
3416,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Grieving such body’s dole.
3417,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,
3418,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Then grief gave place
3419,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,To a strange pulsing rapture as she spoke;
3420,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"For I could catch the glimpses of God’s grace,"
3421,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,And a desire awoke
3422,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,
3423,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,To take this trust
3424,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"And warm and gladden it with love’s new fires,"
3425,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Burning the past to ashes and to dust
3426,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Through purified desires.
3427,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,
3428,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"We walked our way,"
3429,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,One way hewn for us from the birth of Time;
3430,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,For we had wandered into Love’s strange clime
3431,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Through ways sin waits to slay.
3432,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,
3433,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"Love’s euphony,"
3434,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"In Love’s own temple that is our glad hearts,"
3435,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Makes now long music wild deliciously;
3436,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Now Grief hath used his darts.
3437,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,
3438,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"Love infinite,"
3439,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"Chastened by sorrow, hallowed by pure flame—"
3440,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Not all the surging world can compass it.
3441,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Love—Love—O tremulous name!
3442,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,
3443,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,God’s mercy shines;
3444,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,"And my full heart hath made record of this,"
3445,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Of grief that burst from out its dark confines
3446,A BALLAD OF WHITECHAPEL,Into strange sunlit bliss.

3811,THE BLIND GOD,And the wise man and the fool
3812,THE BLIND GOD,In its depths like fishes lie.
3813,THE BLIND GOD,When an angel drops a rod
3814,THE BLIND GOD,And he draws you to the sky
3815,THE BLIND GOD,Will you bear to meet your God
3816,THE BLIND GOD,You have streaked with blasphemy?
3817,THE BLIND GOD,
3818,THE BLIND GOD,
3819,THE FEMALE GOD,THE FEMALE GOD
3820,THE FEMALE GOD,
3821,THE FEMALE GOD,We curl into your eyes—
3822,THE FEMALE GOD,They drink our fires and have never drained;
3823,THE FEMALE GOD,In the fierce forest of your hair
3824,THE FEMALE GOD,Our desires beat blindly for their treasure.
3825,THE FEMALE GOD,
3826,THE FEMALE GOD,"In your eyes’ subtle pit,"
3827,THE FEMALE GOD,"Far down, glimmer our souls;"
3828,THE FEMALE GOD,And your hair like massive forest trees
3829,THE FEMALE GOD,"Shadows our pulses, overtired and dumb."
3830,THE FEMALE GOD,
3831,THE FEMALE GOD,Like a candle lost in an electric glare
3832,THE FEMALE GOD,Our spirits tread your eyes’ infinities;
3833,THE FEMALE GOD,In the wrecking waves of your tumultuous locks
3834,THE FEMALE GOD,Do you not hear the moaning of our pulses?
3835,THE FEMALE GOD,
3836,THE FEMALE GOD,Queen! Goddess! Animal!
3837,THE FEMALE GOD,In sleep do your dreams battle with our souls?
3838,THE FEMALE GOD,When your hair is spread like a lover on the pillow
3839,THE FEMALE GOD,Do not our jealous pulses wake between?
3840,THE FEMALE GOD,
3841,THE FEMALE GOD,"You have dethroned the ancient God,"
3842,THE FEMALE GOD,"You have usurped his Sabbath, his common days;"
3843,THE FEMALE GOD,"Yea, every moment is delivered to you,"
3844,THE FEMALE GOD,"Our Temple, our Eternal, our one God!"
3845,THE FEMALE GOD,
3846,THE FEMALE GOD,"Our souls have passed into your eyes,"
3847,THE FEMALE GOD,Our days into your hair;
3848,THE FEMALE GOD,"And you, our rose-deaf prison, are very pleased with the world,"
3849,THE FEMALE GOD,Your world.
3850,THE FEMALE GOD,
3851,THE FEMALE GOD,
3852,GOD,GOD
3853,GOD,
3854,GOD,"In his malodorous brain what slugs and mire,"
3855,GOD,"Lanthorned in his oblique eyes, guttering burned!"
3856,GOD,His body lodged a rat where men nursed souls:
3857,GOD,The world flashed grape-green eyes of a foiled cat
3858,GOD,"To him. On fragments of an old shrunk power,"
3859,GOD,"On shy and maimed, on women wrung awry,"
3860,GOD,He lay—a bullying hulk—to crush them more;
3861,GOD,"But when one fearless turned and clawed like bronze,"
3862,GOD,"Cringing was easy to blunt these stern paws,"
3863,GOD,And he would weigh the heavier on those after.
3864,GOD,
3865,GOD,Who rests in God’s mean flattery now? Your wealth
3866,GOD,"Is but his cunning to make death more hard,"
3867,GOD,Your iron sinews take more pain in breaking;
3868,GOD,And he has made the market for your beauty
3869,GOD,Too poor to buy although you die to sell.
3870,GOD,"Only that he has never heard of sleep,"
3871,GOD,"And when the cats come out the rats are sly,"
3872,GOD,Here we are safe till he slinks in at dawn.
3873,GOD,
3874,GOD,"But he has gnawed a fibre from strange roots,"
3875,GOD,And in the morning some pale wonder ceases.
3876,GOD,Things are not strange; and strange things are forgetful.
3877,GOD,"Ah! If the day were arid, somehow lost"
3878,GOD,"Out of us; but it is as hair of us,"
3879,GOD,"And only in the hush no wind stirs it,"
3880,GOD,"And in the light vague trouble lifts and breathes,"
3881,GOD,And restlessness still shadows the lost ways.
3882,GOD,The fingers shut on voices that pass through
3883,GOD,Where blind farewells are taken easily.
3884,GOD,
3885,GOD,"Ah, this miasma of a rotting God!"
3886,GOD,

3888,SLEEP,SLEEP
3889,SLEEP,
3890,SLEEP,Godhead’s lip hangs
3891,SLEEP,"When our pulses have no golden tremors,"
3892,SLEEP,And his whips are flicked by mice
3893,SLEEP,And all star-amorous things.
3894,SLEEP,
3895,SLEEP,"Drops, drops of shivering quiet"
3896,SLEEP,Filter under my lids.
3897,SLEEP,Now only am I powerful.
3898,SLEEP,What though the cunning gods outwit us here
3899,SLEEP,"In daytime and in playtime,"
3900,SLEEP,Surely they feel the gyves we lay on them
3901,SLEEP,In our sleep.
3902,SLEEP,
3903,SLEEP,"O, subtle gods lying hidden!"
3904,SLEEP,"O, gods with your oblique eyes!"
3905,SLEEP,"Your elbows in the dawn, and wrists"
3906,SLEEP,"Bright with the afternoon,"
3907,SLEEP,Do you not shake when a mortal slides
3908,SLEEP,Into your own unvexed peace?
3909,SLEEP,
3910,SLEEP,When a moving stillness breaks over your knees
3911,SLEEP,"(An emanation of piled æons’ pressures),"
3912,SLEEP,"From our bodies flat and straight,"
3913,SLEEP,"And your limbs are locked,"
3914,SLEEP,"Futilely gods,"
3915,SLEEP,And shut your sinister essences?

3919,MY DAYS,
3920,MY DAYS,My days are but the tombs of buried hours;
3921,MY DAYS,Which tombs are hidden in the pilèd years;
3922,MY DAYS,"But from the mounds there spring up many flowers,"
3923,MY DAYS,Whose beauty well repays their cost of tears.
3924,MY DAYS,"Time, like a sexton, pileth mould on mould,"
3925,MY DAYS,Minutes on minutes till the tombs are high;
3926,MY DAYS,"But from the dust there fall some grains of gold,"
3927,MY DAYS,And the dead corpse leaves what will never die—
3928,MY DAYS,"It may be but a thought, the nursling seed"
3929,MY DAYS,"Of many thoughts, of many a high desire;"
3930,MY DAYS,"Some little act that stirs a noble deed,"
3931,MY DAYS,Like breath rekindling a smouldering fire:
3932,MY DAYS,"They only live who have not lived in vain,"
3933,MY DAYS,For in their works their life returns again.
