233,SONG,
234,SONG,I met a child when the world was dark
235,SONG,And I was drear and alone;

255,HERITAGE,The life-blood of a race that lies
256,HERITAGE,Long dead. The jewels burning in your rings
257,HERITAGE,Are an Egyptian woman's eyes.
258,HERITAGE,
259,HERITAGE,Your beads are dead bones; even my breath
260,HERITAGE,Breathes hot words that were others' pain.
261,HERITAGE,"Now these fair things are ours awhile, till death"
262,HERITAGE,Brings us to quiet sleep again.
263,HERITAGE,
264,HERITAGE,Then we shall put our love aside
265,HERITAGE,"For lovers of a later birth,"
266,HERITAGE,"And leave to them this body's fragrant pride,"
267,HERITAGE,"For jewels, in the heart of earth."

274,WATCHING,Peaceful. Stars keep
275,WATCHING,"Great guard upon you. Calm, and still, and white"
276,WATCHING,You are. One moment all your pale swift hair
277,WATCHING,Is quiet as the night.

279,WATCHING,"Here in this mud, this beastliness"
280,WATCHING,"Of war, the thought"
281,WATCHING,Of your soft sleep
282,WATCHING,Soothes a tired mind as a rare ointment may
283,WATCHING,"Comfort a wound, sweet-scented ointment brought"

292,LONELINESS,The rest is silence now. And I
293,LONELINESS,Can feel my loneliness around
294,LONELINESS,Me fall. No human face
295,LONELINESS,There is. None speaks. Never a sound
296,LONELINESS,Save whispering leaves in this still place.
