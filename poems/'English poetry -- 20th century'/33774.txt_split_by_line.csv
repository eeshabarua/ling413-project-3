77,NOTE,
78,NOTE,"If the mental attitude of any critic has ever, in his approach to a"
79,NOTE,"first book of verse, been conciliated by an appreciative notice from"
80,NOTE,"some older pen, I should say (speaking out of no little experience) that"
81,NOTE,"either the author was dead and the fact advertised in the preface, or,"
82,NOTE,"alternatively, that the critic was possessed by a gentler spirit than"
83,NOTE,"mine. I am sure at any rate that artistic work, great or small, should"
84,NOTE,be sternly judged on what it is rather than on what it promises. The
85,NOTE,"late J. Comyns Carr, in the days when he wrote dramatic criticism, let"
86,NOTE,loose this restive truth in a couple of short sentences--'We are told
87,NOTE,that So-and-so is a promising young actor. Personally I don't care how
88,NOTE,much he promises so long as he never again performs.'
89,NOTE,
90,NOTE,"Let me, then, pass over Mr Gerald Bullett's verses with the simple"
91,NOTE,remark that I believe in them (he himself calls them 'MICE'--no
92,NOTE,"overweening title, however boldly printed. Yet mice were dear to Apollo"
93,NOTE,"Smintheus, and his proper emblem): and let me come to the general"
94,NOTE,purpose of this Note.
95,NOTE,
96,NOTE,It is meant to preface a series of small volumes of verse by young
97,NOTE,"writers, mostly Cambridge men. That, since the War, young men in"
98,NOTE,extraordinary numbers have taken to expressing themselves in verse is a
99,NOTE,"plain fact, not to be denied: that they choose, as often as not, to"
100,NOTE,express themselves in 'numbers' extraordinary to us can as hardly be
101,NOTE,"contested. But the point is, they have a crowding impulse to say"
102,NOTE,something; and to say it with the emotional seriousness proper to
103,NOTE,"Poetry. For my part, I love the discipline of verse: but I love the"
104,NOTE,"impulse better. Time will soften--I hope not too soon, lest it sugar"
105,NOTE,down and sentimentalise--a certain bitterness of resentment observable
106,NOTE,"in this booklet and its next followers: but, as nothing in verse is"
107,NOTE,"nobler than true tradition, anything is more hopeful than convention."
108,NOTE,
109,NOTE,So these booklets have been planned to give youth its chance to make
110,NOTE,spoons or spoil horns. If anyone object that the print and page
111,NOTE,"over-dignify the content of any one volume in the proposed series, why,"
112,NOTE,"that must be a particular criticism, which cannot honestly (I think) be"
113,NOTE,"enlarged to blame the publisher's wish, and the care he has taken, that"
114,NOTE,"what pretends, however modestly, to be a work of the Muse, should step"
115,NOTE,forth to the public in honourable dress.

339,CONTENTS,
340,CONTENTS,
341,CONTENTS,We are of baser quality: we have been
342,CONTENTS,Tried by fire and judged a spurious gold.
343,CONTENTS,We are little of soul; and yet in our pigmy way
344,CONTENTS,We have suffered and loved with a love that cannot be told.
345,CONTENTS,
346,CONTENTS,"Being less than you, we did not eagerly quaff"
347,CONTENTS,The cup of gall: we prayed that it might pass.
348,CONTENTS,We are not gods: we are pitiful human stuff;
349,CONTENTS,And the blood of our passion has stained Gethsemane's grass.
350,CONTENTS,
351,CONTENTS,We were not blind to the vision. We heard the call
352,CONTENTS,"And followed, or watched our belov√®d steadfastly go."
353,CONTENTS,"But our grief is naked, and shivers, and will not be soothed"
354,CONTENTS,"By splendid phrases, or clothed in a moral glow."
355,CONTENTS,
356,CONTENTS,"We cannot say for our comfort: 'Losing them,"
357,CONTENTS,"We gain a glimpse of noble terrible heights,"
358,CONTENTS,"A cleansing exquisite pain, a sacred grief,"
359,CONTENTS,A dream to cherish'--we think of the vanished lights;
360,CONTENTS,
361,CONTENTS,"We think of the fine nerves shattered, the warm blood chilled,"
362,CONTENTS,"The laughter silenced, the zest and the beauty gone,"

373,CONTENTS,(Having once paid the necessary fee)
374,CONTENTS,"In some nice suburb not too far from town,"
375,CONTENTS,"To eat and sleep and kiss complacently,"
376,CONTENTS,Loving by rote as decent people do:
377,CONTENTS,"Was it for this we hungered, I and you?"
378,CONTENTS,
379,CONTENTS,"A lover's vows are gossamer, they say;"
380,CONTENTS,But we have registered our mutual vow
381,CONTENTS,"For seven and sixpence, dearest. Yesterday"
382,CONTENTS,"There was but love to bind our hearts, but now"
383,CONTENTS,We owe it to the Vicar to be good
384,CONTENTS,And love each other as we said we would.
385,CONTENTS,
386,CONTENTS,That promise at the altar is a link
387,CONTENTS,(Which only death can break) between us two;
388,CONTENTS,For every time I kiss you I shall think:
389,CONTENTS,'How this would please the Vicar if he knew!'
390,CONTENTS,"And we shall put our youthful dreams to bed,"
391,CONTENTS,And so live on--long after we are dead.
392,CONTENTS,
393,CONTENTS,We are made one. One mind will serve us both.
394,CONTENTS,"('Oh yes, we think Locke's novels rather sweet!')"

408,CONTENTS,That only pathetic piety seeks to hide
409,CONTENTS,In a theological costume of long ago.
410,CONTENTS,
411,CONTENTS,The goal we seek to attain will never be ours:
412,CONTENTS,All our hopes will end in ashes and dust;
413,CONTENTS,"All our dreams will be dead desolate flowers,"
