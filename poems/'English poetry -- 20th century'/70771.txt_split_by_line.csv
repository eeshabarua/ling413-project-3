1312,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Hawk-headed and immense of ancient Egypt.
1313,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Thus grieved he. And the huge begnarlèd hands
1314,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Pillared his jaw. A chillness gloomed his face
1315,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,As on bare hills shadow of moveless cloud.
1316,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Nor spake he aught. But when the sun raged high
1317,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Grappling a rock he dashed it ’gainst his breast
1318,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,And roared till the golden-green sea blackened
1319,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"And spouting drove, loud with careering gulls,"
1320,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Before his gusty breath; but passion spent
1321,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"Dropping then pined, while from the single eye"
1322,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"One tear, as huge and hot as Phlegethon,"
1323,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Fell in a hissing flood.
1324,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,
1325,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"_Girl._ Alas, poor brute!"

1330,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"But, at the last, confusedly arousing"
1331,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"His sluggish hands, groped for and found his pipes"
1332,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"Twin, dry, boughless trunks of beech fire-hollowed"
1333,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,And with huge cinder bored. This pair he set
1334,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"To cave-like mouth, then, pursing hairy lips,"
1335,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"Vented, with monster fingers laid on stops,"
1336,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,His heart’s deep sorrow: ’twas a wounding sound.
1337,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,
1338,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"_Girl._ And was it angry, then, the giant’s plaint?"
1339,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,
1340,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,_Shepherd._ Angry ’twas not: though anger in it spake
1341,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,As of a rebel turning eye to heav’n
1342,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,With moody imprecation natural
1343,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,To one so crossed from birth. Melancholy
1344,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Lent majesty to strains uncouth. He mourned
1345,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,The gift of might which is his mightiest foe.
1346,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Mourned! though the dire pipes themselves rebelling
1347,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Came apt not to his hand. With rage he shook
1348,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"Yet, obstinate, subdued them to his mood"
1349,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"So that they brimmed the dusky lower air,"
1350,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"The fire-strewn skies, flushed cliffs and tawny sea"
1351,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,With the beauty borne of desolation.
1352,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Thus lingered he.
1353,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,
1354,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"_Girl._ And of the tune itself,"
1355,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"Ugly, was it?"
1356,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,
1357,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"_Shepherd._ Listen: when twilight fell,"
1358,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"While the near wave lapsed with but seldom foam,"
1359,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"Darkling against the light foretells the moon,"
1360,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"He still played on. “Strange end,” thought I, “thou hast,"
1361,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"Poor fool whose all of life is ended now,"
1362,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Saving the music thou canst make of it.”
1363,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"Since, as I think, his heart is shipwrecked now:"
1364,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"Heart, but not song! For as the night waxed late"
1365,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Somewhat of beauty found he and with beauty
1366,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Somewhat of solace. To the last I listened
1367,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,The while th’ unbroken moon rocked in the tide
1368,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"And multitudes of sea-sprites, glistering,"
1369,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"Rose up in choir, but, sudden, hushed to hear"
1370,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Such grief pine on. Thus somewhat was the sound--
1371,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Like to the muffled wind among the crags
1372,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"When night is clear, without or stars or moon,"
1373,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,And lightless clouds drift on a lightless sky;
1374,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"Or as the mournful blowing of the waves,"
1375,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Which in the pyloned gloom of northern cave
1376,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Nightly with flood soon-swallowed and discharge
1377,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"Of pouring foam, deep tide and troubled ebb,"
1378,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Makes profound plaint and dreary melody
1379,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"To lightless waste, huge night and solemn stars."
1380,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Such was the Cyclops’ music.
1381,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,
1382,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"_Girl._ Ah, poor soul!"
1383,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,
1384,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,_Shepherd._ Dost weep?
1385,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,
1386,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"_Girl._ Yes, shepherd."
1387,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,
1388,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"_Shepherd._ Fie, now; comfort thee!"
1389,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,The gods wax angry at a lass’s tears
1390,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"Who has no whit to cry for. Thus say I,"
1391,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Those there are who ev’n by living darken
1392,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,The lives of such as are less passionate
1393,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"Yet in their fall, by ev’n the full measure"
1394,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,"That they o’ertopped us, must we mourn for them,"
1395,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,Such wonder has Life bared.
1396,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,

1399,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,

1401,THE SHEPHERD. A GIRL.,So: round my neck as mine sinks now round thine....
