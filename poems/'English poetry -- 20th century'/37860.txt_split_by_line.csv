41,_DEDICATION_,
42,_DEDICATION_,"_Lord, I have seen at harvest festival"
43,_DEDICATION_,"In a white lamp-lit fishing-village church,"
44,_DEDICATION_,"How the poor folk, lacking fine decorations,"
45,_DEDICATION_,Offer the first-fruits of their various toils:
46,_DEDICATION_,"Not only fruit and blossom of the fields,"
47,_DEDICATION_,"Ripe corn and poppies, scabious, marguerites,"
48,_DEDICATION_,"Melons and marrows, carrots and potatoes,"
49,_DEDICATION_,"And pale round turnips and sweet cottage flowers,"
50,_DEDICATION_,"But gifts of other produce, heaped brown nets,"
51,_DEDICATION_,"Fine pollack, silver fish with umber backs,"
52,_DEDICATION_,"And handsome green-dark-blue-striped mackerel,"
53,_DEDICATION_,"And uglier, hornier creatures from the sea,"
54,_DEDICATION_,"Lobsters, long-clawed and eyed, and smooth flat crabs,"
55,_DEDICATION_,"Ranged with the flowers upon the window-niches,"
56,_DEDICATION_,To lie in that symbolic contiguity
57,_DEDICATION_,While lusty hymns of gratitude ascend._
58,_DEDICATION_,
59,_DEDICATION_,_So I
60,_DEDICATION_,Here offer all I have found:
61,_DEDICATION_,A few bright stainless flowers
62,_DEDICATION_,"And richer, earthlier blooms, and homely grain,"
63,_DEDICATION_,"And roots that grew distorted in the dark,"
64,_DEDICATION_,And shapes of livid hue and sprawling form
65,_DEDICATION_,Dragged from the deepest maters I have searched.
66,_DEDICATION_,"Most diverse gifts, yet all alike in this:"
67,_DEDICATION_,They are all the natural products of my mind
68,_DEDICATION_,And heart and senses;
69,_DEDICATION_,"And all with labour grown, or plucked, or caught._"

74,PREFACE,PREFACE
75,PREFACE,
76,PREFACE,The title of this book was chosen for this reason.  Had the volume been
77,PREFACE,called ---- _and Other Poems_ it might have given a false impression
78,PREFACE,that its contents were entirely new.  Had it been called _Collected
79,PREFACE,Poems_ the equally false impression might have been given that there
80,PREFACE,was something of finality about it.  The title selected seemed best to
81,PREFACE,"convey both the fact that it was a collection and that, under"
82,PREFACE,"Providence, other (and, let us hope, superior) collections will follow"
83,PREFACE,it.
84,PREFACE,
85,PREFACE,The book contains all that I do not wish to destroy of the contents of
86,PREFACE,four volumes of verse.  A number of small corrections have been made.
87,PREFACE,"There are added, also, a few recent poems not previously published."
88,PREFACE,"The earliest of the poems now reprinted is dated 1905, in which year I"
89,PREFACE,"was twenty-one.  Some of the subsequent years, such as 1914 and 1915,"
90,PREFACE,contributed nothing to this book: the greater number of the poems were
91,PREFACE,written in 1911-1912 and 1916-1917.
92,PREFACE,
93,PREFACE,Some of the poems were not written as I should now write them; and many
94,PREFACE,"of them reflect transient, though mostly recurrent, moods which I do"
95,PREFACE,not necessarily think worthy of esteem.

192,I. MORNING,The village fades away
193,I. MORNING,"Where I last night came,"
194,I. MORNING,Where they housed me and fed me
195,I. MORNING,And never asked my name.
196,I. MORNING,
197,I. MORNING,"The sun shines bright, my step is light,"
198,I. MORNING,"I, who have no abode,"
199,I. MORNING,"Jeer at the stuck, monotonous"
200,I. MORNING,Black posts along the road.

204,II. MIDDAY,
205,II. MIDDAY,"The wood is still,"
206,II. MIDDAY,As here I sit
207,II. MIDDAY,My heart drinks in
208,II. MIDDAY,The peace of it.
209,II. MIDDAY,
210,II. MIDDAY,A something stirs
211,II. MIDDAY,"I know not where,"
212,II. MIDDAY,Some quiet spirit
213,II. MIDDAY,In the air.
214,II. MIDDAY,
215,II. MIDDAY,O tall straight stems!
216,II. MIDDAY,O cool deep green!
217,II. MIDDAY,O hand unfelt!
218,II. MIDDAY,O face unseen!

222,III. EVENING,
223,III. EVENING,"The evening closes in,"
224,III. EVENING,As down this last long lane
225,III. EVENING,I plod; there patter round
226,III. EVENING,First heavy drops of rain.
227,III. EVENING,
228,III. EVENING,"Feet ache, legs ache, but now"
229,III. EVENING,Step quickens as I think
230,III. EVENING,Of mounds of bread and cheese
231,III. EVENING,And something hot to drink.

235,IV. NIGHT,
236,IV. NIGHT,"Ah! sleep is sweet, but yet"
237,IV. NIGHT,I will not sleep awhile
238,IV. NIGHT,Nor for a space forget
239,IV. NIGHT,The toil of that last mile;
240,IV. NIGHT,
241,IV. NIGHT,But lie awake and feel
242,IV. NIGHT,The cool sheets' tremulous kisses
243,IV. NIGHT,O'er all my body steal...
244,IV. NIGHT,Is sleep as sweet as this is?

250,THE ROOF,
251,I,I
252,I,
253,I,When the clouds hide the sun away
254,I,"The tall slate roof is dull and grey,"
255,I,And when the rain adown it streams
256,I,'Tis polished lead with pale-blue gleams.
257,I,
258,I,When the clouds vanish and the rain
259,I,"Stops, and the sun comes out again,"
260,I,It shimmers golden in the sun
261,I,Almost too bright to look upon.
262,I,
263,I,But soon beneath the steady rays
264,I,"The roof is dried and reft of blaze,"
265,I,'Tis dusty yellow traversed through
266,I,By long thin lines of deepest blue.
267,I,
268,I,"Then at the last, as night draws near,"
269,I,"The lines grow faint and disappear,"
270,I,"The roof becomes a purple mist,"
271,I,A great square darkening amethyst
272,I,
273,I,Which sinks into the gathering shade
274,I,"Till separate form and colour fade,"
275,I,And it is but a patch which mars
276,I,The beauty of a field of stars.
277,I,
278,I,
279,II,II
280,II,
281,II,It stands so lonely in the sky
282,II,"The sparrows never come thereby,"
283,II,The glossy starlings seldom stop
284,II,To preen and chatter on the top.
285,II,
286,II,For a whole week sometimes up there
287,II,"No wing-wave stirs the quiet air,"
288,II,The roof lies silent and serene
289,II,As though no life had ever been;
290,II,
291,II,"Till some bright afternoon, athwart"
292,II,"The edge two sudden shadows dart,"
293,II,And two white pigeons with pink feet
294,II,Flutter above and pitch on it.
295,II,
296,II,Jerking their necks out as they walk
297,II,"They talk awhile their pigeon-talk,"
298,II,A low continuous murmur blent
299,II,Of mock reproaches and content.
300,II,
301,II,"Then cease, and sit there warm and white"
302,II,"An hour, till in the fading light"
303,II,"They wake, and know the close of day,"
304,II,"Flutter above, and fly away,"
305,II,
306,II,Leaving the roof whereon they sat
307,II,"As 'twas before, a peaceful flat"
308,II,"Expanse, as silent and serene"
309,II,As though no life had ever been.

314,TOWN,TOWN
315,TOWN,
316,TOWN,Mostly in a dull rotation
317,TOWN,We bear our loads and eat and drink and sleep.
318,TOWN,"Feeling no tears, knowing no meditation--"
319,TOWN,"Too tired to think, too clogged with earth to weep."
320,TOWN,
321,TOWN,"Dimly convinced, poor groping wretches,"
322,TOWN,Like eyeless insects in a murky pond
323,TOWN,"That out and out this city stretches,"
324,TOWN,"Away, away, and there is no beyond."
325,TOWN,
326,TOWN,"No larger earth, no loftier heaven,"
327,TOWN,"No cleaner, gentler airs to breathe.  And yet,"
328,TOWN,Even to us sometimes is given
329,TOWN,Visions of things we other times forget.
330,TOWN,
331,TOWN,"Some day is done, its labour ended,"
332,TOWN,"And as we sit and brood at windows high,"
333,TOWN,"A steady wind from far descended,"
334,TOWN,Blows off the filth that hid the deeper sky;
335,TOWN,
336,TOWN,"There are the empty waiting spaces,"
337,TOWN,"We watch, we watch, unwinking, pale and dumb,"
338,TOWN,"Till gliding up with noiseless paces,"
339,TOWN,Night covers all the wide arch: Night has come.
340,TOWN,
341,TOWN,"Not that sick false night of the city,"
342,TOWN,"Lurid and low and yellow and obscene,"
343,TOWN,"But mother Night, pure, full of pity,"
344,TOWN,"The star-strewn Night, blue, potent and serene."
345,TOWN,
346,TOWN,"O, as we gaze the clamour ceases,"
347,TOWN,"The turbid world around grows dim and small,"
348,TOWN,The soft-shed influence releases
349,TOWN,Our shrouded spirits from their dusty pall.
350,TOWN,
351,TOWN,"No more we hear the turbulent traffic,"
352,TOWN,Not scorned but unremembered is the day;
353,TOWN,"The Night, all luminous and seraphic,"
354,TOWN,Has brushed its heavy memories away.
355,TOWN,
356,TOWN,"The great blue Night so clear and kindly,"
357,TOWN,"The little stars so wide-eyed and so still,"
358,TOWN,Open a door for souls that blindly
359,TOWN,"Had wandered, tunnelling the endless hill;"
360,TOWN,
361,TOWN,"They draw the long-untraversed portal,"
362,TOWN,"Our souls slip out and tremble and expand,"
363,TOWN,"The immortal feels for the immortal,"
364,TOWN,The eternal holds the eternal by the hand.
365,TOWN,
366,TOWN,"Impalpably we are led and lifted,"
367,TOWN,"Softly we shake into the gulf of blue,"
368,TOWN,The last environing veil is rifted
369,TOWN,And lost horizons float into our view.
370,TOWN,
371,TOWN,"Lost lands, lone seas, lands that afar gleam"
372,TOWN,"With a miraculous beauty, faint yet clear,"
373,TOWN,"Forgotten lands of night and star-gleam,"
374,TOWN,Seas that are somewhere but that are not here.
375,TOWN,
376,TOWN,"Borne without effort or endeavour,"
377,TOWN,"Swifter and more ethereal than the wind,"
378,TOWN,"In level track we stream, whilst ever"
379,TOWN,The fair pale panorama rolls behind.
380,TOWN,
381,TOWN,"Now fleets below a trancèd moorland,"
382,TOWN,A sweep of glimmering immobility;
383,TOWN,Now craggy cliff and dented foreland
384,TOWN,Pass back and there beyond unfolds the sea.
385,TOWN,
386,TOWN,"Now wastes of water heaving, drawing,"
387,TOWN,"Great darkling tracts of patterned restlessness,"
388,TOWN,With whitened waves round rough rocks mawing
389,TOWN,And licking islands in their fierce caress.
390,TOWN,
391,TOWN,Now coasts with capes and ribboned beaches
392,TOWN,"Set silent 'neath the canopy sapphirine,"
393,TOWN,And estuaries and river reaches.
394,TOWN,Phantasmal silver in the night's soft shine.
395,TOWN,
396,TOWN,*     *     *     *     *
397,TOWN,
398,TOWN,"Ah, these fair woods the spirit crosses,"
399,TOWN,"These quiet lakes, these stretched dreaming fields,"
400,TOWN,These undulate downs with piny bosses
401,TOWN,Pointing the ridges of their sloping shields.
402,TOWN,
403,TOWN,"These valleys and these heights that screen them,"
404,TOWN,"These tawnier sands where grass and tree are not,"
405,TOWN,"Ah, we have known them, we have seen them,"
406,TOWN,We saw them long ago and we forgot;
407,TOWN,
408,TOWN,"We know them all, these placid countries,"
409,TOWN,And what the pathway is and what the goal;
410,TOWN,These are the gates and these the sentries
411,TOWN,That guard that ancient fortress of the soul.
412,TOWN,
413,TOWN,"And we speed onward flying, flying,"
414,TOWN,Over the sundering waves of hill and plain
415,TOWN,To where they rear their heads undying
416,TOWN,The unnamed mountains of old days again.
417,TOWN,
418,TOWN,"The snows upon their calm still summits,"
419,TOWN,"The chasms, the files of trees that foot the snow,"
420,TOWN,"Curving like inky frozen comets,"
421,TOWN,Into the forest-ocean spread below.
422,TOWN,
423,TOWN,"The glisten where the peaks are hoarest,"
424,TOWN,"The soundless darkness of the sunken vales,"
425,TOWN,"The folding leagues of shadowy forest,"
426,TOWN,Edge beyond edge till all distinctness fails.
427,TOWN,
428,TOWN,"So invulnerable it is, so deathless,"
429,TOWN,"So floods the air the loveliness of it,"
430,TOWN,"That we stay dazzled, rapt and breathless,"
431,TOWN,Our beings ebbing to the infinite.
432,TOWN,
433,TOWN,"There as we pause, there as we hover,"
434,TOWN,"Still-poised in ecstasy, a sudden light"
435,TOWN,"Breaks in our eyes, and we discover"
436,TOWN,We sit at windows gazing to the night.
437,TOWN,
438,TOWN,"Wistful and tired, with eyes a-tingle"
439,TOWN,Where still the sting of Beauty faintly smarts;
440,TOWN,But with our mute regrets there mingle
441,TOWN,Thanks for the resurrection of our hearts.
442,TOWN,
443,TOWN,O night so great that will not mock us!
444,TOWN,O stars so wise that understand the weak!
445,TOWN,O vast consoling hands that rock us!
446,TOWN,O strong and perfect tongues that speak!
447,TOWN,
448,TOWN,O night enrobed in azure splendour!
449,TOWN,O whispering stars whose radiance falls like dew!
450,TOWN,"O mighty presences and tender,"
451,TOWN,You have given us back the dreams our childhood knew!
452,TOWN,
453,TOWN,"Lulled by your visions without number,"
454,TOWN,"We seek our beds content and void of pain,"
455,TOWN,And dreaming drowse and dreaming slumber
456,TOWN,And dreaming wake to see the day again.

464,I,
465,I,When I was a boy there was a friend of mine:
466,I,"We thought ourselves warriors and grown folk swine,"
467,I,Stupid old animals who never understood
468,I,"And never had an impulse and said ""you must be good."""
469,I,
470,I,"We slank like stoats and fled like foxes,"
471,I,"We put cigarettes in the pillar-boxes,"
472,I,Lighted cigarettes and letters all aflame--
473,I,O the surprise when the postman came!
474,I,
475,I,We stole eggs and apples and made fine hay
476,I,"In people's houses when people were away,"
477,I,"We broke street lamps and away we ran,"
478,I,Then I was a boy but now I am a man.
479,I,
480,I,"Now I am a man and don't have any fun,"
481,I,"I hardly ever shout and I never, never run,"
482,I,"And I don't care if he's dead that friend of mine,"
483,I,For then I was a boy and now I am a swine.
484,I,
485,I,
486,II,II
487,II,
488,II,We met again the other night
489,II,"With people; you were quite polite,"
490,II,Shook my hand and spoke a while
491,II,Of common things with cautious smile;
492,II,Paid the usual debt men owe
493,II,To fellows whom they used to know.
494,II,"But, when our eyes met full, yours dropped,"
495,II,"And sudden, resolute, you stopped,"
496,II,Moving with hurried syllables
497,II,To make remarks to someone else.
498,II,"I caught them not, to me they said:"
499,II,"""Let the dead past bury its dead,"
500,II,"Things were very different then,"
501,II,"Boys are fools and men are men."""
502,II,Several times the other night
503,II,You did your best to be polite;
504,II,When in the conversation's round
505,II,You heard my tongue's familiar sound
506,II,You bent in eager pose my way
507,II,To hear what I had got to say;
508,II,"Trying, you thought with some success,"
509,II,To hide the chasm's nakedness.
510,II,But on your eyes hard films there lay;
511,II,"No mock-interest, no pretence"
512,II,Could veil your blank indifference;
513,II,And if thoughts came recalling things
514,II,"Far-off, far-off, from those old springs"
515,II,When underneath the moon and sun
516,II,"Our separate pulses beat as one,"
517,II,Vagrant tender thoughts that asked
518,II,Admittance found the portal masked;
519,II,"You spurned them; when I'd said my say,"
520,II,With laugh and nod you turned away
521,II,To toss your friends some easy jest
522,II,That smote my brow and stabbed my breast.
523,II,Foolish though it be and vain
524,II,"I am not master of my pain,"
525,II,And when I said good-night to you
526,II,"I hoped we should not meet again,"
527,II,And wondered how the soul I knew
528,II,Could change so much; have I changed too?
529,II,
530,II,
531,III,III
532,III,
533,III,There was a man whom I knew well
534,III,Whose choice it was to live in hell;
535,III,Reason there was why that was so
536,III,But what it was I do not know.
537,III,
538,III,"He had a room high in a tower,"
539,III,"And sat there drinking hour by hour,"
540,III,"Drinking, drinking all alone"
541,III,With candles and a wall of stone.
542,III,

1395,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Solid as once, but intimations"
1396,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,That touch us with warm misty fingers

1908,I,"A failing hill, a daily dimming scene,"

1934,II,Unless I fight dispersal with my will...
1935,II,So I shall do it ... but too conscious still

1937,II,"How soon your journey was to end alone,"
1938,II,"I should not, now that you have gone from view,"
1939,II,Be gathering derelict odds and ends of you;
1940,II,But in the intense lucidity of pain
1941,II,Your likeness would have burnt into my brain.
1942,II,"I did not know; lovable and unique,"
1943,II,"As volatile as a bubble and as weak,"
1944,II,"You sat with me, and my eyes registered"
1945,II,"This thing and that, and sluggishly I heard"

1951,III,"So in my mind there's not much left of you,"

1953,III,Patches of memory's mirror still are bright
1954,III,Nor your reflected image there has quite
1955,III,"Faded and slipped away, it will be well"
1956,III,To search for each surviving syllable
1957,III,Of voice and body and soul.  And some I'll find
1958,III,"Right to my hand, and some tangled and blind"
1959,III,Among the obscure weeds that fill the mind.
1960,III,A pause....
1961,III,I plunge my thought's hooked resolute claws
1962,III,Deep in the turbid past.  Like drowned things in the jaws
1963,III,"Of grappling-irons, your features to the verge"
1964,III,Of conscious knowledge one by one emerge.
1965,III,Can I not make these scattered things unite? ...
1966,III,I knit my brows and clench my eyelids tight
1967,III,And focus to a point....  Streams of dark pinkish light
1968,III,Convolve; and now spasmodically there flit
1969,III,Clear pictures of you as you used to sit:--
1970,III,"The way you crossed your legs stretched in your chair,"
1971,III,"Elbow at rest and tumbler in the air,"
1972,III,"Jesting on books and politics and worse,"
1973,III,And still good company when most perverse.
1974,III,Capricious friend!
1975,III,"Here in this room not long before the end,"
1976,III,Here in this very room six months ago
1977,III,You poised your foot and joked and chuckled so.
1978,III,"Beyond the window shook the ash-tree bough,"
1979,III,"You saw books, pictures, as I see them now,"
1980,III,"The sofa then was blue, the telephone"
1981,III,"Listened upon the desk, and softly shone"
1982,III,"Even as now the fire-irons in the grate,"
1983,III,"And the little brass pendulum swung, a seal of fate"
1984,III,Stamping the minutes; and the curtains on window and door
1985,III,Just moved in the air; and on the dark boards of the floor
1986,III,These same discreetly-coloured rugs were lying...
1987,III,And then you never had a thought of dying.

1995,IV,The you that sat and drank in that arm-chair
1996,IV,Will never sit there again.
1997,IV,For months you have lain
1998,IV,Under a graveyard's green
1999,IV,In some place abroad where I've never been.
2000,IV,"Perhaps there is a stone over you,"
2001,IV,Or only the wood and the earth and the grass cover you.
2002,IV,But it doesn't much matter; for dead and decayed you lie
2003,IV,"Like a million million others who felt they would never die,"
2004,IV,"Like Alexander and Helen the beautiful,"
2005,IV,And the last collier hanged for murdering his trull;
2006,IV,All done with and buried in an equal bed.

2014,V,"Into a violet cloth, and the frail ash-tree hisses"
2015,V,With a soft sharpness like a fall of mounded grain.
2016,V,"And a steamer softly puffing along the river passes,"
2017,V,Drawing a file of barges; and silence falls again.
2018,V,And a bell tones; and the evening darkens; and in sparse rank
2019,V,The greenish lights well out along the other bank.
2020,V,I have no force left now; the sights and sounds impinge
2021,V,"Upon me unresisted, like raindrops on the mould."
2022,V,"And, striving not against my melancholy mood,"
2023,V,"Limp as a door that hangs upon one failing hinge,"
2024,V,"Limp, with slack marrowless arms and thighs, I sit and brood"
2025,V,"On death and death and death.  And quiet, thin and cold,"
2026,V,"Following of this one friend the hopeless, helpless ghost,"
2027,V,The weak appealing wraiths of notable men of old
2028,V,"Who died, pass through the air; and then, host after host,"
2029,V,"Innumerable, overwhelming, without form,"
2030,V,"Rolling across the sky in awful silent storm,"
2031,V,The myriads of the undifferentiated dead
2032,V,"Whom none recorded, or of whom the record faded."
2033,V,O spectacle appallingly sublime!
2034,V,"I see the universe one long disastrous strife,"
2035,V,And in the staggering abysses of backward and forward time
2036,V,Death chasing hard upon the heels of creating life.
2037,V,"And I, I see myself as one of a heap of stones"
2038,V,"Wetted a moment to life as the flying wave goes over,"
2039,V,"Onward and never returning, leaving no mark behind."
2040,V,"There's nothing to hope for.  Blank cessation numbs my mind,"
2041,V,"And I feel my heart thumping gloomy against its cover,"
2042,V,My heavy belly hanging from my bones.

2047,VI,Below in the dark street
2048,VI,"There is a tap of feet,"

2050,VI,How often I have let of late
2051,VI,This thought of death come over me.
2052,VI,How often I will sit and backward trace
2053,VI,"The deathly history of the human race,"
2054,VI,"The ripples of men who chattered and were still,"
2055,VI,"Known and unknown, older and older, until"
2056,VI,"Before man's birth I fall, shivering and aghast"
2057,VI,Through a hole in the bottom of the remotest past;
2058,VI,Till painfully my spirit throws
2059,VI,Her giddiness off; and then as soon
2060,VI,"As I recover and try to think again,"
2061,VI,Life seems like death; and all my body grows
2062,VI,"Icily cold, and all my brain"
2063,VI,Cold as the jagged craters of the moon....
2064,VI,And I wonder is it not strange that I
2065,VI,Who thus have heard eternity's black laugh
2066,VI,"And felt its freezing breath,"
2067,VI,Should sometimes shut it out from memory
2068,VI,"So as to play quite prettily with death,"
2069,VI,And turn an easy epitaph?
2070,VI,
2071,VI,I can hear a voice whispering in my brain:
2072,VI,"""Why this is the old futility again!"
2073,VI,Criminal! day by day
2074,VI,Your own life is ebbing swiftly away.
2075,VI,"And what have you done with it,"
2076,VI,"Except to become a maudlin hypocrite?"""
2077,VI,"Yes, I know, I know;"
2078,VI,One should not think of death or the dead overmuch; but one's
2079,VI,mind's made so
2080,VI,"That at certain times the roads of thought all lead to death,"
2081,VI,And false reasoning clouds one's soul as a window with breath
2082,VI,"Is clouded in winter's air,"
2083,VI,And all the faith one may have
2084,VI,Lies useless and dead as a body in the grave.

2138,THE LILY OF MALUD,
2139,THE LILY OF MALUD,The lily of Malud is born in secret mud.
2140,THE LILY OF MALUD,It is breathed like a word in a little dark ravine
2141,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Where no bird was ever heard and no beast was ever seen,"
2142,THE LILY OF MALUD,And the leaves are never stirred by the panther's velvet sheen.
2143,THE LILY OF MALUD,
2144,THE LILY OF MALUD,"It blooms once a year in summer moonlight,"
2145,THE LILY OF MALUD,In a valley of dark fear full of pale moonlight:
2146,THE LILY OF MALUD,"It blooms once a year, and dies in a night,"
2147,THE LILY OF MALUD,And its petals disappear with the dawn's first light;
2148,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And when that night has come, black small-breasted maids,"
2149,THE LILY OF MALUD,"With ecstatic terror dumb, steal fawn-like through the shades"
2150,THE LILY OF MALUD,"To watch, hour by hour, the unfolding of the flower."
2151,THE LILY OF MALUD,
2152,THE LILY OF MALUD,"When the world is full of night, and the moon reigns alone"
2153,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And drowns in silver light the known and the unknown,"
2154,THE LILY OF MALUD,"When each hut is a mound, half blue silver and half black,"
2155,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And casts upon the ground the hard shadow of its back,"
2156,THE LILY OF MALUD,"When the winds are out of hearing and the tree-tops never shake,"
2157,THE LILY OF MALUD,When the grass in the clearing is silent but awake
2158,THE LILY OF MALUD,'Neath a moon-paven sky: all the village is asleep
2159,THE LILY OF MALUD,And the babes that nightly cry dream deep:
2160,THE LILY OF MALUD,"From the doors the maidens creep,"
2161,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Tiptoe over dreaming curs, soft, so soft, that not one stirs,"
2162,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And stand curved and a-quiver, like bathers by a river,"
2163,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Looking at the forest wall, groups of slender naked girls,"
2164,THE LILY OF MALUD,Whose black bodies shine like pearls where the moonbeams fall.
2165,THE LILY OF MALUD,"They have waked, they knew not why, at a summons from the night,"
2166,THE LILY OF MALUD,"They have stolen fearfully from the dark to the light,"
2167,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Stepping over sleeping men, who have moved and slept again:"
2168,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And they know not why they go to the forest, but they know,"
2169,THE LILY OF MALUD,As their moth-feet pass to the shore of the grass
2170,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And the forest's dreadful brink, that their tender spirits shrink:"
2171,THE LILY OF MALUD,"They would flee, but cannot turn, for their eyelids burn"
2172,THE LILY OF MALUD,"With frenzy, and each maid, ere she leaves the moonlit space,"
2173,THE LILY OF MALUD,If she sees another's face is thrilled and afraid.
2174,THE LILY OF MALUD,
2175,THE LILY OF MALUD,Now like little phantom fawns they thread the outer lawns
2176,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Where the boles of giant trees stand about in twos and threes,"
2177,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Till the forest grows more dense and the darkness more intense,"
2178,THE LILY OF MALUD,And they only sometimes see in a lone moon-ray
2179,THE LILY OF MALUD,"A dead and spongy trunk in the earth half-sunk,"
2180,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Or the roots of a tree with fungus grey,"
2181,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Or a drift of muddy leaves, or a banded snake that heaves."
2182,THE LILY OF MALUD,
2183,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And the towering unseen roof grows more intricate, and soon"
2184,THE LILY OF MALUD,It is featureless and proof to the lost forgotten moon.
2185,THE LILY OF MALUD,But they could not look above as with blind-drawn feet they move
2186,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Onwards on the scarce-felt path, with quick and desperate breath,"
2187,THE LILY OF MALUD,"For their circling fingers dread to caress some slimy head,"
2188,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Or to touch the icy shape of a hunched and hairy ape,"
2189,THE LILY OF MALUD,And at every step they fear in their very midst to hear
2190,THE LILY OF MALUD,A lion's rending roar or a tiger's snore....
2191,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And when things swish or fall, they shiver but dare not call."
2192,THE LILY OF MALUD,
2193,THE LILY OF MALUD,O what is it leads the way that they do not stray?
2194,THE LILY OF MALUD,What unimagined arm keeps their bodies from harm?
2195,THE LILY OF MALUD,What presence concealed lifts their little feet that yield
2196,THE LILY OF MALUD,Over dry ground and wet till their straining eyes are met
2197,THE LILY OF MALUD,With a thinning of the darkness?
2198,THE LILY OF MALUD,And the foremost faintly cries in awed surprise:
2199,THE LILY OF MALUD,And they one by one emerge from the gloom to the verge
2200,THE LILY OF MALUD,Of a small sunken vale full of moonlight pale.
2201,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And they hang along the bank, clinging to the branches dank,"
2202,THE LILY OF MALUD,A shadowy festoon out of sight of the moon;
2203,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And they see in front of them, rising from the mud"
2204,THE LILY OF MALUD,A single straight stem and a single pallid bud
2205,THE LILY OF MALUD,In that little lake of light from the moon's calm height.
2206,THE LILY OF MALUD,
2207,THE LILY OF MALUD,"A stem, a ghostly bud, on the moon-swept mud"
2208,THE LILY OF MALUD,That shimmers like a pond; and over there beyond
2209,THE LILY OF MALUD,"The guardian forest high, menacing and strange,"
2210,THE LILY OF MALUD,Invades the empty sky with its wild black range.
2211,THE LILY OF MALUD,
2212,THE LILY OF MALUD,And they watch hour by hour that small lonely flower
2213,THE LILY OF MALUD,In that deep forest place that hunter never found.
2214,THE LILY OF MALUD,
2215,THE LILY OF MALUD,"It shines without sound, as a star in space."
2216,THE LILY OF MALUD,
2217,THE LILY OF MALUD,And the silence all around that solitary place
2218,THE LILY OF MALUD,Is like silence in a dream; till a sudden flashing gleam
2219,THE LILY OF MALUD,Down their dark faces flies; and their lips fall apart
2220,THE LILY OF MALUD,And their glimmering great eyes with excitement dart
2221,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And their fingers, clutching the branches they were touching,"
2222,THE LILY OF MALUD,Shake and arouse hissing leaves on the boughs.
2223,THE LILY OF MALUD,
2224,THE LILY OF MALUD,And they whisper aswoon: Did it move in the moon?
2225,THE LILY OF MALUD,O it moved as it grew!
2226,THE LILY OF MALUD,"It is moving, opening, with calm and gradual will,"
2227,THE LILY OF MALUD,And their bodies where they cling are shadowed and still
2228,THE LILY OF MALUD,And with marvel they mark that the mud now is dark
2229,THE LILY OF MALUD,"For the unfolding flower, like a goddess in her power,"
2230,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Challenges the moon with a light of her own,"
2231,THE LILY OF MALUD,"That lovelily grows as the petals unclose,"
2232,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Wider, more wide with an awful inward pride,"
2233,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Till the heart of it breaks, and stilled is their breath,"
2234,THE LILY OF MALUD,For the radiance it makes is as wonderful as death.
2235,THE LILY OF MALUD,
2236,THE LILY OF MALUD,The morning's crimson stain tinges their ashen brows
2237,THE LILY OF MALUD,As they part the last boughs and slowly step again
2238,THE LILY OF MALUD,"On to the village grass, and chill and languid pass"
2239,THE LILY OF MALUD,Into the huts to sleep.
2240,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Brief slumber, yet so deep"
2241,THE LILY OF MALUD,"That, when they wake to day, darkness and splendour seem"
2242,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Broken and far away, a faint miraculous dream;"
2243,THE LILY OF MALUD,And when those maidens rise they are as they ever were
2244,THE LILY OF MALUD,Save only for a rare shade of trouble in their eyes.
2245,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And the surly thick-lipped men, as they sit about their huts"
2246,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Making drums out of guts, grunting gruffly now and then,"
2247,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Carving sticks of ivory, stretching shields of wrinkled skin,"
2248,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Smoothing sinister and thin squatting gods of ebony,"
2249,THE LILY OF MALUD,Chip and grunt and do not see.
2250,THE LILY OF MALUD,"But each mother, silently,"
2251,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Longer than her wont stays shut in the dimness of her hut,"
2252,THE LILY OF MALUD,"For she feels a brooding cloud of memory in the air,"
2253,THE LILY OF MALUD,A lingering thing there that makes her sit bowed
2254,THE LILY OF MALUD,"With hollow shining eyes, as the night-fire dies,"
2255,THE LILY OF MALUD,"And stare softly at the ember, and try to remember"
2256,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Something sorrowful and far, something sweet and vaguely seen"
2257,THE LILY OF MALUD,Like an early evening star when the sky is pale green:
2258,THE LILY OF MALUD,"A quiet silver tower that climbed in an hour,"
2259,THE LILY OF MALUD,"Or a ghost like a flower, or a flower like a queen:"
2260,THE LILY OF MALUD,Something holy in the past that came and did not last.
2261,THE LILY OF MALUD,
2262,THE LILY OF MALUD,But she knows not what it was.

2309,A HOUSE,And all a universe of nameless messengers
2310,A HOUSE,"From unknown distances may whisper fear,"
2311,A HOUSE,"And it will imitate immortal permanence,"
2312,A HOUSE,And stare and stare ahead and scarcely hear.
2313,A HOUSE,
2314,A HOUSE,"It stood there yesterday; it will to-morrow, too,"
2315,A HOUSE,"When there is none to watch, no alien eyes"
2316,A HOUSE,To watch its ugliness assume a majesty
2317,A HOUSE,From this great solitude of evening skies.
2318,A HOUSE,
2319,A HOUSE,"So lone, so very small, with worlds and worlds around,"
2320,A HOUSE,While life remains to it prepared to outface

2407,TO A BULL-DOG,
2408,TO A BULL-DOG,"We sha'n't see Willy any more, Mamie,"
2409,TO A BULL-DOG,He won't be coming any more:
2410,TO A BULL-DOG,"He came back once and again and again,"
2411,TO A BULL-DOG,But he won't get leave any more.
2412,TO A BULL-DOG,
2413,TO A BULL-DOG,"We looked from the window and there was his cab,"
2414,TO A BULL-DOG,"And we ran downstairs like a streak,"
2415,TO A BULL-DOG,"And he said ""Hullo, you bad dog,"" and you crouched to the floor,"
2416,TO A BULL-DOG,"Paralysed to hear him speak,"
2417,TO A BULL-DOG,
2418,TO A BULL-DOG,And then let fly at his face and his chest
2419,TO A BULL-DOG,"Till I had to hold you down,"
2420,TO A BULL-DOG,While he took off his cap and his gloves and his coat.
2421,TO A BULL-DOG,And his bag and his thonged Sam Browne.
2422,TO A BULL-DOG,
2423,TO A BULL-DOG,"We went upstairs to the studio,"
2424,TO A BULL-DOG,"The three of us, just as of old,"
2425,TO A BULL-DOG,And you lay down and I sat and talked to him
2426,TO A BULL-DOG,As round the room he strolled.
2427,TO A BULL-DOG,
2428,TO A BULL-DOG,"Here in the room where, years ago"
2429,TO A BULL-DOG,"Before the old life stopped,"
2430,TO A BULL-DOG,"He worked all day with his slippers and his pipe,"
2431,TO A BULL-DOG,"He would pick up the threads he'd dropped,"
2432,TO A BULL-DOG,
2433,TO A BULL-DOG,"Fondling all the drawings he had left behind,"
2434,TO A BULL-DOG,"Glad to find them all still the same,"
2435,TO A BULL-DOG,And opening the cupboards to look at his belongings
2436,TO A BULL-DOG,... Every time he came.
2437,TO A BULL-DOG,
2438,TO A BULL-DOG,"But now I know what a dog doesn't know,"
2439,TO A BULL-DOG,"Though you'll thrust your head on my knee,"
2440,TO A BULL-DOG,And try to draw me from the absent-mindedness
2441,TO A BULL-DOG,That you find so dull in me.
2442,TO A BULL-DOG,
2443,TO A BULL-DOG,And all your life you will never know
2444,TO A BULL-DOG,"What I wouldn't tell you even if I could,"
2445,TO A BULL-DOG,That the last time we waved him away
2446,TO A BULL-DOG,Willy went for good.
2447,TO A BULL-DOG,
2448,TO A BULL-DOG,But sometimes as you lie on the hearthrug
2449,TO A BULL-DOG,"Sleeping in the warmth of the stove,"
2450,TO A BULL-DOG,Even through your muddled old canine brain
2451,TO A BULL-DOG,Shapes from the past may rove.
2452,TO A BULL-DOG,
2453,TO A BULL-DOG,"You'll scarcely remember, even in a dream,"
2454,TO A BULL-DOG,How we brought home a silly little pup.
2455,TO A BULL-DOG,With a big square head and little crooked legs
2456,TO A BULL-DOG,"That could scarcely bear him up,"
2457,TO A BULL-DOG,
2458,TO A BULL-DOG,But your tail will tap at the memory
2459,TO A BULL-DOG,"Of a man whose friend you were,"
2460,TO A BULL-DOG,Who was always kind though he called you a naughty dog
2461,TO A BULL-DOG,When he found you on his chair;
2462,TO A BULL-DOG,
2463,TO A BULL-DOG,Who'd make you face a reproving finger
2464,TO A BULL-DOG,And solemnly lecture you
2465,TO A BULL-DOG,Till your head hung downwards and you looked very sheepish!
2466,TO A BULL-DOG,And you'll dream of your triumphs too.
2467,TO A BULL-DOG,
2468,TO A BULL-DOG,Of summer evening chases in the garden
2469,TO A BULL-DOG,When you dodged us all about with a bone:

2472,TO A BULL-DOG,
2473,TO A BULL-DOG,"When summer comes again,"
2474,TO A BULL-DOG,"And the long sunsets fade,"
2475,TO A BULL-DOG,We shall have to go on playing the feeble game for two
2476,TO A BULL-DOG,That since the war we've played.
2477,TO A BULL-DOG,
2478,TO A BULL-DOG,And though you run expectant as you always do
2479,TO A BULL-DOG,"To the uniforms we meet,"
2480,TO A BULL-DOG,You'll never find Willy among all the soldiers
2481,TO A BULL-DOG,"In even the longest street,"
2482,TO A BULL-DOG,
2483,TO A BULL-DOG,"Nor in any crowd; yet, strange and bitter thought,"
2484,TO A BULL-DOG,"Even now were the old words said,"
2485,TO A BULL-DOG,"If I tried the old trick and said ""Where's Willy?"""
2486,TO A BULL-DOG,"You would quiver and lift your head,"
2487,TO A BULL-DOG,
2488,TO A BULL-DOG,"And your brown eyes would look to ask if I were serious,"
2489,TO A BULL-DOG,And wait for the word to spring.
2490,TO A BULL-DOG,"Sleep undisturbed: I sha'n't say that again,"
2491,TO A BULL-DOG,You innocent old thing.
2492,TO A BULL-DOG,
2493,TO A BULL-DOG,"I must sit, not speaking, on the sofa,"
2494,TO A BULL-DOG,While you lie asleep on the floor;
2495,TO A BULL-DOG,"For he's suffered a thing that dogs couldn't dream of,"

2616,AUGUST MOON,Silence.  Time is suspended; that the light fails
2617,AUGUST MOON,"One would not know were it not for the moon in the sky,"
2618,AUGUST MOON,"And the broken moon in the water, whose fractures tell"
2619,AUGUST MOON,"Of slow broad ripples that otherwise do not show,"
2620,AUGUST MOON,"Maturing imperceptibly from a pale to a deeper gold,"
2621,AUGUST MOON,"A golden half moon in the sky, and broken gold in the water."
2622,AUGUST MOON,
2623,AUGUST MOON,"In the water, tranquilly severing, joining, gold:"
2624,AUGUST MOON,Three or four little plates of gold on the river:
2625,AUGUST MOON,A little motion of gold between the dark images
2626,AUGUST MOON,Of two tall posts that stand in the grey water.
2627,AUGUST MOON,
2628,AUGUST MOON,"There are voices passing, a murmur of quiet voices,"
2629,AUGUST MOON,"A woman's laugh, and children going home."
2630,AUGUST MOON,"A whispering couple, leaning over the railings,"
2631,AUGUST MOON,"And, somewhere, a little splash as a dog goes in."

2634,AUGUST MOON,"There is no change anywhere, nothing will ever change."
2635,AUGUST MOON,
2636,AUGUST MOON,"I heard a story, a crazy and tiresome myth."
2637,AUGUST MOON,
2638,AUGUST MOON,Listen! behind the twilight a deep low sound
2639,AUGUST MOON,"Like the constant shutting of very distant doors,"
2640,AUGUST MOON,
2641,AUGUST MOON,Doors that are letting people over there
2642,AUGUST MOON,Out to some other place beyond the end of the sky.

2727,UNDER,
2728,UNDER,"In this house, she said, in this high second storey,"
2729,UNDER,"In this room where we sit, above the midnight street,"
2730,UNDER,"There runs a rivulet, narrow but very rapid,"
2731,UNDER,Under the still floor and your unconscious feet.
2732,UNDER,
2733,UNDER,The lamp on the table made a cone of light
2734,UNDER,That spread to the base of the walls: above was in gloom.
2735,UNDER,"I heard her words with surprise; had I worked here so long,"
2736,UNDER,And never divined that secret of the room?
2737,UNDER,
2738,UNDER,"""But how,"" I asked, ""does the water climb so high?"""
2739,UNDER,"""I do not know,"" she said, ""but the thing is there;"
2740,UNDER,"Pull up the boards while I go and fetch you a rod."""
2741,UNDER,"She passed, and I heard her creaking descend the stair."
2742,UNDER,
2743,UNDER,And I rose and rolled the Turkey carpet back
2744,UNDER,"From the two broad boards by the north wall she had named,"
2745,UNDER,"And, hearing already the crumple of water, I knelt"
2746,UNDER,"And lifted the first of them up; and the water gleamed,"
2747,UNDER,
2748,UNDER,"Bordered with little frosted heaps of ice,"
2749,UNDER,"And, as she came back with a rod and line that swung,"
2750,UNDER,I moved the other board; in the yellow light
2751,UNDER,"The water trickled frostily, slackly along."
2752,UNDER,
2753,UNDER,"I took the tackle, a stiff black rubber worm,"
2754,UNDER,"That stuck out its pointed tail from a cumbrous hook,"
2755,UNDER,"""But there can't be fishing in water like this,"" I said."
2756,UNDER,"And she, with weariness, ""There is no ice there.  Look."""
2757,UNDER,
2758,UNDER,"And I stood there, gazing down at a stream in spate,"
2759,UNDER,Holding the rod in my undecided hand...
2760,UNDER,"Till it all in a moment grew smooth and still and clear,"
2761,UNDER,And along its deep bottom of slaty grey sand
2762,UNDER,
2763,UNDER,"Three scattered little trout, as black as tadpoles,"
2764,UNDER,"Came waggling slowly along the glass-dark lake,"
2765,UNDER,"And I swung my arm to drop my pointing worm in,"
2766,UNDER,And then I stopped again with a little shake.
2767,UNDER,
2768,UNDER,For I heard the thin gnat-like voices of the trout
2769,UNDER,--My body felt woolly and sick and astray and cold--
2770,UNDER,"Crying with mockery in them: ""You are not allowed"
2771,UNDER,"To take us, you know, under ten years old."""
2772,UNDER,
2773,UNDER,"And the room swam, the calm woman and the yellow lamp,"
2774,UNDER,"The table, and the dim-glistering walls, and the floor,"

2776,UNDER,"And I moaned, and the pain at my heart grew more and more."
2777,UNDER,
2778,UNDER,"And I fainted away, utterly miserable."
2779,UNDER,"Falling in a place where there was nothing to pass,"
2780,UNDER,"Knowing all sorrows and the mothers and sisters of sorrows,"

2793,RIVERS,"To valleys of meadows and watercress-beds,"
2794,RIVERS,"And bridges whereunder, dark weed-coloured shadows,"
2795,RIVERS,Trout flit or lie.
2796,RIVERS,
2797,RIVERS,I know those rivers that peacefully glide
2798,RIVERS,"Past old towers and shaven gardens,"
2799,RIVERS,Where mottled walls rise from the water
2800,RIVERS,And mills all streaked with flour;
2801,RIVERS,"And rivers with wharves and rusty shipping,"

2804,RIVERS,Full of the pride of power;

2811,RIVERS,"Placid Elbe, Seine slaty and swirling,"
2812,RIVERS,"And Isar, son of the Alpine snows,"
2813,RIVERS,A furious turquoise flood.
2814,RIVERS,
2815,RIVERS,"All these I have known, and with slow eyes"

2829,RIVERS,"Niger, Indus, Zambesi,"
2830,RIVERS,"And the Yellow River, and the Oxus,"

2848,RIVERS,"The boatmen chant ancient songs,"
2849,RIVERS,The tenderest known to man.

2853,RIVERS,Arches and buttresses silver-shadowy
2854,RIVERS,"In the high moon,"
2855,RIVERS,And palms grouped in the moonlight
2856,RIVERS,"And fanes girdled with cypresses,"
2857,RIVERS,Their domes of marble softly shining
2858,RIVERS,To the high silver moon.

2874,RIVERS,And the lines of green grew higher
2875,RIVERS,"And I breathed deep, and there above me"
2876,RIVERS,The forest wall stood high.
2877,RIVERS,
2878,RIVERS,Those forest walls of the Amazon
2879,RIVERS,Are level under the blazing blue

2882,RIVERS,And under their lowest drooping boughs
2883,RIVERS,"Mud-banks torpidly bubble,"

2885,RIVERS,Drift and twist and pause.
2886,RIVERS,
2887,RIVERS,"And everywhere, tacitly joining,"
2888,RIVERS,"Float noiseless tributaries,"
2889,RIVERS,Tall avenues paved with water:
2890,RIVERS,And as I silent fly
2891,RIVERS,"The vegetation like a painted scene,"

2904,RIVERS,
2905,RIVERS,"Rotting scrofulous steaming trunks,"
2906,RIVERS,"Great horned emerald beetles crawling,"
2907,RIVERS,Ants and huge slow butterflies

2909,RIVERS,"Ah, sick I have swooned as the air thickened"
2910,RIVERS,"To a pallid brown ecliptic glow,"

2913,RIVERS,
2914,RIVERS,"Thunder in the dun dusk, thunder"

2918,RIVERS,"Till the land bows in the darkness,"
2919,RIVERS,"Utterly lost and defenceless,"
2920,RIVERS,Smitten and blinded and overwhelmed
2921,RIVERS,By the crashing rods of rain.
2922,RIVERS,

2927,RIVERS,The wreathing odours of a thousand trees
2928,RIVERS,"And the flowers' faint gleaming presences,"
2929,RIVERS,And over the clearings and the still waters
2930,RIVERS,Soft indigo and hanging stars.

2938,RIVERS,"Yet by starlight, moonlight, or sunlight,"
2939,RIVERS,"Long, long though they look, these wandering eyes,"
2940,RIVERS,"Even on the fairest waters of dream,"
2941,RIVERS,Never untroubled gaze.
2942,RIVERS,
2943,RIVERS,"For whatever stream I stand by,"
2944,RIVERS,"And whatever river I dream of,"
2945,RIVERS,There is something still in the back of my mind
2946,RIVERS,From very far away;
2947,RIVERS,"There is something I saw and see not,"
2948,RIVERS,A country full of rivers
2949,RIVERS,That stirs in my heart and speaks to me
2950,RIVERS,"More sure, more dear than they."
2951,RIVERS,
2952,RIVERS,And always I ask and wonder
2953,RIVERS,(Though often I do not know it):
2954,RIVERS,Why does this water not smell like water?
2955,RIVERS,Where is the moss that grew
2956,RIVERS,Wet and dry on the slabs of granite
2957,RIVERS,And the round stones in clear brown water?
2958,RIVERS,--And a pale film rises before them
2959,RIVERS,Of the rivers that first I knew.
2960,RIVERS,
2961,RIVERS,"Though famous are the rivers of the great world,"
2962,RIVERS,Though my heart from those alien waters drinks
2963,RIVERS,"Delight however pure from their loveliness,"
2964,RIVERS,"And awe however deep,"
2965,RIVERS,Would I wish for a moment the miracle
2966,RIVERS,"That those waters should come to Chagford,"
2967,RIVERS,Or gather and swell in Tavy Cleave
2968,RIVERS,Where the stones cling to the steep?
2969,RIVERS,
2970,RIVERS,"No, even were they Ganges and Amazon"
2971,RIVERS,"In all their great might and majesty,"
2972,RIVERS,"League upon league of wonders,"
2973,RIVERS,"I would lose them all, and more,"
2974,RIVERS,"For a light chiming of small bells,"
2975,RIVERS,"A twisting flash in the granite,"
2976,RIVERS,The tiny thread of a pixie waterfall
2977,RIVERS,That lives by Vixen Tor.
2978,RIVERS,
2979,RIVERS,"Those rivers in that lost country,"
2980,RIVERS,"They were brown as a clear brown bead is,"
2981,RIVERS,"Or red with the earth that rain washed down,"
2982,RIVERS,Or white with china-clay;
2983,RIVERS,"And some tossed foaming over boulders,"
2984,RIVERS,"And some curved mild and tranquil,"
2985,RIVERS,In wooded vales securely set
2986,RIVERS,Under the fond warm day.
2987,RIVERS,
2988,RIVERS,"Okement and Erme and Avon,"
2989,RIVERS,"Exe and his ruffled shallows,"
2990,RIVERS,I could cry as I think of those rivers
2991,RIVERS,That knew my morning dreams;
2992,RIVERS,The weir by Tavistock at evening
2993,RIVERS,"When the circling woods were purple,"
2994,RIVERS,"And the Lowman in spring with the lent-lilies,"
2995,RIVERS,And the little moorland streams.
2996,RIVERS,
2997,RIVERS,For many a hillside streamlet
2998,RIVERS,"There falls with a broken tinkle,"
2999,RIVERS,"Falling and dying, falling and dying."
3000,RIVERS,"In little cascades and pools,"
3001,RIVERS,Where the world is furze and heather
3002,RIVERS,"And flashing plovers and fixed larks,"
3003,RIVERS,"And an empty sky, whitish blue,"
3004,RIVERS,That small world rules.
3005,RIVERS,
3006,RIVERS,"There, there, where the high waste bog-lands"
3007,RIVERS,"And the drooping slopes and the spreading valleys,"
3008,RIVERS,The orchards and the cattle-sprinkled pastures
3009,RIVERS,"Those travelling musics fill,"
3010,RIVERS,"There is my lost Abana,"
3011,RIVERS,And there is my nameless Pharphar
3012,RIVERS,"That mixed with my heart when I was a boy,"
3013,RIVERS,And time stood still.
3014,RIVERS,
3015,RIVERS,And I say I will go there and die there:
3016,RIVERS,"But I do not go there, and sometimes"
3017,RIVERS,"I think that the train could not carry me there,"
3018,RIVERS,"And it's possible, maybe,"
3019,RIVERS,"That it's farther than Asia or Africa,"
3020,RIVERS,"Or any voyager's harbour,"
3021,RIVERS,"Farther, farther, beyond recall...."
