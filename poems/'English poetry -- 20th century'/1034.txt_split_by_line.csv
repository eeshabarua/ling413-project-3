29,POEMS,
30,POEMS,
31,POEMS,In writing an Introduction such as this it is good to be brief. The
32,POEMS,poems printed in this book need no preliminary commendations from me or
33,POEMS,anyone else.  The author has left us his own fragmentary but impressive
34,POEMS,"Foreword; this, and his Poems, can speak for him, backed by the"
35,POEMS,"authority of his experience as an infantry soldier, and sustained by"
36,POEMS,nobility and originality of style.  All that was strongest in Wilfred
37,POEMS,Owen survives in his poems; any superficial impressions of his
38,POEMS,"personality, any records of his conversation, behaviour, or appearance,"
39,POEMS,would be irrelevant and unseemly.  The curiosity which demands such
40,POEMS,morsels would be incapable of appreciating the richness of his work.
41,POEMS,
42,POEMS,The discussion of his experiments in assonance and dissonance (of which
43,POEMS,'Strange Meeting' is the finest example) may be left to the professional
44,POEMS,"critics of verse, the majority of whom will be more preoccupied with"
45,POEMS,such technical details than with the profound humanity of the self-
46,POEMS,revelation manifested in such magnificent lines as those at the end of
47,POEMS,"his 'Apologia pro Poemate Meo', and in that other poem which he named"
48,POEMS,'Greater Love'.
49,POEMS,
50,POEMS,The importance of his contribution to the literature of the War cannot
51,POEMS,"be decided by those who, like myself, both admired him as a poet and"
52,POEMS,valued him as a friend.  His conclusions about War are so entirely in
53,POEMS,accordance with my own that I cannot attempt to judge his work with any
54,POEMS,critical detachment.  I can only affirm that he was a man of absolute
55,POEMS,integrity of mind.  He never wrote his poems (as so many war-poets did)
56,POEMS,to make the effect of a personal gesture. He pitied others; he did not
57,POEMS,pity himself.  In the last year of his life he attained a clear vision
58,POEMS,"of what he needed to say, and these poems survive him as his true and"
59,POEMS,splendid testament.
60,POEMS,
61,POEMS,Wilfred Owen was born at Oswestry on 18th March 1893.  He was educated
62,POEMS,"at the Birkenhead Institute, and matriculated at London University in"
63,POEMS,"1910. In 1913 he obtained a private tutorship near Bordeaux, where he"
64,POEMS,remained until 1915.  During this period he became acquainted with the
65,POEMS,"eminent French poet, Laurent Tailhade, to whom he showed his early"
66,POEMS,"verses, and from whom he received considerable encouragement. In 1915,"
67,POEMS,"in spite of delicate health, he joined the Artists' Rifles O.T.C., was"
68,POEMS,"gazetted to the Manchester Regiment, and served with their 2nd Battalion"
69,POEMS,"in France from December 1916 to June 1917, when he was invalided home."
70,POEMS,Fourteen months later he returned to the Western Front and served with
71,POEMS,"the same Battalion, ultimately commanding a Company."
72,POEMS,
73,POEMS,He was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry while taking part in
74,POEMS,"some heavy fighting on 1st October.  He was killed on 4th November 1918,"
75,POEMS,while endeavouring to get his men across the Sambre Canal.
76,POEMS,
77,POEMS,"A month before his death he wrote to his mother:  ""My nerves are in"
78,POEMS,"perfect order.  I came out again in order to help these boys; directly,"
79,POEMS,"by leading them as well as an officer can; indirectly, by watching their"
80,POEMS,"sufferings that I may speak of them as well as a pleader can.""  Let his"
81,POEMS,own words be his epitaph:--
82,POEMS,
83,POEMS,"""Courage was mine, and I had mystery;"
84,POEMS,"Wisdom was mine, and I had mastery."""

100,POEMS,This book is not about heroes.  English Poetry is not yet fit to speak
101,POEMS,"of them.  Nor is it about deeds or lands, nor anything about glory,"
102,POEMS,"honour, dominion or power,"
103,POEMS,
104,POEMS,except War.
105,POEMS,"Above all, this book is not concerned with Poetry."
106,POEMS,"The subject of it is War, and the pity of War."
107,POEMS,The Poetry is in the pity.
108,POEMS,"Yet these elegies are not to this generation,"
109,POEMS,This is in no sense consolatory.
110,POEMS,
111,POEMS,They may be to the next.
112,POEMS,All the poet can do to-day is to warn.
113,POEMS,That is why the true Poets must be truthful.
114,POEMS,"If I thought the letter of this book would last,"
115,POEMS,I might have used proper names; but if the spirit of it survives
116,POEMS,"Prussia,--my ambition and those names will be content; for they will"
117,POEMS,have achieved themselves fresher fields than Flanders.

160,S. I. W.,
161,S. I. W.,It seemed that out of the battle I escaped
162,S. I. W.,"Down some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped"
163,S. I. W.,Through granites which Titanic wars had groined.
164,S. I. W.,"Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned,"
165,S. I. W.,Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred.
166,S. I. W.,"Then, as I probed them, one sprang up, and stared"
167,S. I. W.,"With piteous recognition in fixed eyes,"
168,S. I. W.,Lifting distressful hands as if to bless.
169,S. I. W.,"And by his smile, I knew that sullen hall;"
170,S. I. W.,With a thousand fears that vision's face was grained;
171,S. I. W.,"Yet no blood reached there from the upper ground,"
172,S. I. W.,"And no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan."
173,S. I. W.,"""Strange, friend,"" I said, ""Here is no cause to mourn."""
174,S. I. W.,"""None,"" said the other, ""Save the undone years,"
175,S. I. W.,"The hopelessness.  Whatever hope is yours,"
176,S. I. W.,Was my life also; I went hunting wild
177,S. I. W.,"After the wildest beauty in the world,"
178,S. I. W.,"Which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair,"
179,S. I. W.,"But mocks the steady running of the hour,"
180,S. I. W.,"And if it grieves, grieves richlier than here."
181,S. I. W.,"For by my glee might many men have laughed,"
182,S. I. W.,"And of my weeping something has been left,"
183,S. I. W.,"Which must die now.  I mean the truth untold,"
184,S. I. W.,"The pity of war, the pity war distilled."
185,S. I. W.,Now men will go content with what we spoiled.
186,S. I. W.,"Or, discontent, boil bloody, and be spilled."
187,S. I. W.,"They will be swift with swiftness of the tigress,"
188,S. I. W.,"None will break ranks, though nations trek from progress."
189,S. I. W.,"Courage was mine, and I had mystery;"
190,S. I. W.,"Wisdom was mine, and I had mastery;"
191,S. I. W.,To miss the march of this retreating world
192,S. I. W.,Into vain citadels that are not walled.
193,S. I. W.,"Then, when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels"
194,S. I. W.,"I would go up and wash them from sweet wells,"
195,S. I. W.,Even with truths that lie too deep for taint.
196,S. I. W.,I would have poured my spirit without stint
197,S. I. W.,But not through wounds; not on the cess of war.
198,S. I. W.,Foreheads of men have bled where no wounds were.
199,S. I. W.,"I am the enemy you killed, my friend."
200,S. I. W.,I knew you in this dark; for so you frowned
201,S. I. W.,Yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed.
202,S. I. W.,I parried; but my hands were loath and cold.

212,S. I. W.,Earth's wheels run oiled with blood.  Forget we that.
213,S. I. W.,Let us lie down and dig ourselves in thought.
214,S. I. W.,"Beauty is yours and you have mastery,"
215,S. I. W.,"Wisdom is mine, and I have mystery."
216,S. I. W.,We two will stay behind and keep our troth.
217,S. I. W.,"Let us forego men's minds that are brute's natures,"
218,S. I. W.,"Let us not sup the blood which some say nurtures,"
219,S. I. W.,Be we not swift with swiftness of the tigress.
220,S. I. W.,Let us break ranks from those who trek from progress.
221,S. I. W.,Miss we the march of this retreating world
222,S. I. W.,Into old citadels that are not walled.
223,S. I. W.,Let us lie out and hold the open truth.
224,S. I. W.,Then when their blood hath clogged the chariot wheels
225,S. I. W.,We will go up and wash them from deep wells.
226,S. I. W.,What though we sink from men as pitchers falling
227,S. I. W.,Many shall raise us up to be their filling
228,S. I. W.,Even from wells we sunk too deep for war
229,S. I. W.,And filled by brows that bled where no wounds were.

244,S. I. W.,As the stained stones kissed by the English dead.
245,S. I. W.,Kindness of wooed and wooer
246,S. I. W.,Seems shame to their love pure.
247,S. I. W.,"O Love, your eyes lose lure"
248,S. I. W.,When I behold eyes blinded in my stead!
249,S. I. W.,
250,S. I. W.,Your slender attitude
251,S. I. W.,"Trembles not exquisite like limbs knife-skewed,"
252,S. I. W.,Rolling and rolling there
253,S. I. W.,Where God seems not to care;

260,S. I. W.,"Gentle, and evening clear,"
261,S. I. W.,As theirs whom none now hear
262,S. I. W.,Now earth has stopped their piteous mouths that coughed.
263,S. I. W.,
264,S. I. W.,"Heart, you were never hot,"
265,S. I. W.,"Nor large, nor full like hearts made great with shot;"
266,S. I. W.,"And though your hand be pale,"
267,S. I. W.,Paler are all which trail

279,S. I. W.,The mud that cracked on cheeks when wretches smiled.
280,S. I. W.,"War brought more glory to their eyes than blood,"
281,S. I. W.,And gave their laughs more glee than shakes a child.
282,S. I. W.,
283,S. I. W.,Merry it was to laugh there--
284,S. I. W.,Where death becomes absurd and life absurder.
285,S. I. W.,For power was on us as we slashed bones bare
286,S. I. W.,Not to feel sickness or remorse of murder.
287,S. I. W.,
288,S. I. W.,"I, too, have dropped off fear--"
289,S. I. W.,"Behind the barrage, dead as my platoon,"
290,S. I. W.,"And sailed my spirit surging, light and clear"
291,S. I. W.,Past the entanglement where hopes lay strewn;
292,S. I. W.,
293,S. I. W.,And witnessed exultation--
294,S. I. W.,"Faces that used to curse me, scowl for scowl,"
295,S. I. W.,"Shine and lift up with passion of oblation,"
296,S. I. W.,Seraphic for an hour; though they were foul.
297,S. I. W.,
298,S. I. W.,I have made fellowships--
299,S. I. W.,Untold of happy lovers in old song.
300,S. I. W.,For love is not the binding of fair lips
301,S. I. W.,"With the soft silk of eyes that look and long,"
302,S. I. W.,
303,S. I. W.,"By Joy, whose ribbon slips,--"
304,S. I. W.,But wound with war's hard wire whose stakes are strong;
305,S. I. W.,Bound with the bandage of the arm that drips;
306,S. I. W.,Knit in the welding of the rifle-thong.
307,S. I. W.,
308,S. I. W.,I have perceived much beauty
309,S. I. W.,In the hoarse oaths that kept our courage straight;
310,S. I. W.,Heard music in the silentness of duty;
311,S. I. W.,Found peace where shell-storms spouted reddest spate.
312,S. I. W.,
313,S. I. W.,"Nevertheless, except you share"
314,S. I. W.,"With them in hell the sorrowful dark of hell,"

316,S. I. W.,"And heaven but as the highway for a shell,"
317,S. I. W.,
318,S. I. W.,You shall not hear their mirth:
319,S. I. W.,You shall not come to think them well content
320,S. I. W.,By any jest of mine.  These men are worth
321,S. I. W.,Your tears:  You are not worth their merriment.

627,VI,"Behind the wagon that we flung him in,"
628,VI,"And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,"

630,VI,"If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood"
631,VI,Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs
632,VI,Bitter as the cud
633,VI,"Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,--"

649,VI,"Rain, guttering down in waterfalls of slime"
650,VI,"Kept slush waist high, that rising hour by hour,"
651,VI,Choked up the steps too thick with clay to climb.
652,VI,"What murk of air remained stank old, and sour"
653,VI,"With fumes of whizz-bangs, and the smell of men"
654,VI,"Who'd lived there years, and left their curse in the den,"
655,VI,If not their corpses. . . .
656,VI,There we herded from the blast
657,VI,"Of whizz-bangs, but one found our door at last."
658,VI,"Buffeting eyes and breath, snuffing the candles."
659,VI,And thud! flump! thud! down the steep steps came thumping
660,VI,"And splashing in the flood, deluging muck--"
661,VI,"The sentry's body; then his rifle, handles"
662,VI,"Of old Boche bombs, and mud in ruck on ruck."
663,VI,"We dredged him up, for killed, until he whined"
664,VI,"""O sir, my eyes--I'm blind--I'm blind, I'm blind!"""
665,VI,"Coaxing, I held a flame against his lids"
666,VI,And said if he could see the least blurred light
667,VI,He was not blind; in time he'd get all right.
668,VI,"""I can't,"" he sobbed.  Eyeballs, huge-bulged like squids"
669,VI,Watch my dreams still; but I forgot him there
670,VI,"In posting next for duty, and sending a scout"
671,VI,"To beg a stretcher somewhere, and floundering about"
672,VI,To other posts under the shrieking air.
673,VI,
674,VI,"Those other wretches, how they bled and spewed,"
675,VI,"And one who would have drowned himself for good,--"
676,VI,I try not to remember these things now.
677,VI,Let dread hark back for one word only:  how
678,VI,"Half-listening to that sentry's moans and jumps,"
679,VI,"And the wild chattering of his broken teeth,"
680,VI,Renewed most horribly whenever crumps
681,VI,Pummelled the roof and slogged the air beneath--

694,VI,And none of us could kick him to his feet;
695,VI,"Just blinked at my revolver, blearily;"
696,VI,"--Didn't appear to know a war was on,"
697,VI,Or see the blasted trench at which he stared.
698,VI,"""I'll do 'em in,"" he whined, ""If this hand's spared,"
699,VI,"I'll murder them, I will."""

755,II,Littered with blossoms trickling where the blackbird fusses.
756,II,Is it that we are dying?
757,II,
758,II,Slowly our ghosts drag home:  glimpsing the sunk fires glozed
759,II,With crusted dark-red jewels; crickets jingle there;
760,II,For hours the innocent mice rejoice:  the house is theirs;
761,II,Shutters and doors all closed:  on us the doors are closed--
762,II,We turn back to our dying.
763,II,
764,II,Since we believe not otherwise can kind fires burn;
765,II,"Nor ever suns smile true on child, or field, or fruit."
766,II,For God's invincible spring our love is made afraid;
767,II,"Therefore, not loath, we lie out here; therefore were born,"
768,II,For love of God seems dying.

770,II,"To-night, His frost will fasten on this mud and us,"

785,II,"And, finding comfortable chests and knees"
786,II,Carelessly slept.  But many there stood still
787,II,"To face the stark, blank sky beyond the ridge,"
788,II,Knowing their feet had come to the end of the world.
789,II,
790,II,"Marvelling they stood, and watched the long grass swirled"
791,II,"By the May breeze, murmurous with wasp and midge,"
792,II,For though the summer oozed into their veins
793,II,"Like the injected drug for their bones' pains,"
794,II,"Sharp on their souls hung the imminent line of grass,"
795,II,Fearfully flashed the sky's mysterious glass.
796,II,
797,II,Hour after hour they ponder the warm field--
798,II,"And the far valley behind, where the buttercups"
799,II,"Had blessed with gold their slow boots coming up,"

801,II,But clutched and clung to them like sorrowing hands;
802,II,They breathe like trees unstirred.
803,II,
804,II,Till like a cold gust thrilled the little word
805,II,At which each body and its soul begird
806,II,And tighten them for battle.  No alarms
807,II,"Of bugles, no high flags, no clamorous haste--"
808,II,Only a lift and flare of eyes that faced
809,II,"The sun, like a friend with whom their love is done."
810,II,"O larger shone that smile against the sun,--"
811,II,Mightier than his whose bounty these have spurned.
812,II,
813,II,"So, soon they topped the hill, and raced together"
814,II,Over an open stretch of herb and heather
815,II,Exposed.  And instantly the whole sky burned
816,II,With fury against them; and soft sudden cups
817,II,Opened in thousands for their blood; and the green slopes
818,II,Chasmed and steepened sheer to infinite space.
819,II,
820,II,Of them who running on that last high place
821,II,"Leapt to swift unseen bullets, or went up"
822,II,"On the hot blast and fury of hell's upsurge,"
823,II,"Or plunged and fell away past this world's verge,"
824,II,Some say God caught them even before they fell.
825,II,
826,II,But what say such as from existence' brink
827,II,Ventured but drave too swift to sink.
828,II,"The few who rushed in the body to enter hell,"
829,II,And there out-fiending all its fiends and flames
830,II,"With superhuman inhumanities,"

1232,S. I. W.,General Notes:--
1233,S. I. W.,
1234,S. I. W.,
1235,S. I. W.,"Due to the general circumstances surrounding Wilfred Owen, and his death"
1236,S. I. W.,"one week before the war ended, it should be noted that these poems are"
1237,S. I. W.,not all in their final form. Owen had only had a few of his poems
1238,S. I. W.,"published during his lifetime, and his papers were in a state of"
1239,S. I. W.,"disarray when Siegfried Sassoon, his friend and fellow poet, put"
1240,S. I. W.,together this volume. The 1920 edition was the first edition of Owen's
1241,S. I. W.,"poems, the 1921 reprint (of which this is a transcript) added one"
1242,S. I. W.,more--and nothing else happened until Edmund Blunden's 1931 edition.
1243,S. I. W.,"Even with that edition, there remained gaps, and several more editions"
1244,S. I. W.,"added more and more poems and fragments, in various forms, as it was"
1245,S. I. W.,"difficult to tell which of Owen's drafts were his final ones, until Jon"
1246,S. I. W.,"Stallworthy's ""Complete Poems and Fragments"" (1983) included all that"
1247,S. I. W.,"could be found, and tried to put them in chronological order, with the"
1248,S. I. W.,"latest revisions, etc."
1249,S. I. W.,
1250,S. I. W.,"Therefore, it should not be surprising if some or most of these poems"
1251,S. I. W.,differ from later editions.
1252,S. I. W.,
1253,S. I. W.,
1254,S. I. W.,"After Owen's death, his writings gradually gained pre-eminence, so that,"
1255,S. I. W.,"although virtually unknown during the war, he came into high regard."
1256,S. I. W.,"Benjamin Britten, the British composer who set nine of Owen's works as"
1257,S. I. W.,"the text of his ""War Requiem"" (shortly after the Second World War),"
1258,S. I. W.,"called Owen ""by far our greatest war poet, and one of the most original"
1259,S. I. W.,"poets of this century.""  (Owen is especially noted for his use of"
1260,S. I. W.,pararhyme.) Five of those nine texts are some form of poems included
1261,S. I. W.,"here, to wit: 'Anthem for Doomed Youth', 'Futility', 'Parable of the Old"
1262,S. I. W.,"Men and the Young', 'The End', and 'Strange Meeting'.  The other four"
1263,S. I. W.,"were '[Bugles Sang]', 'The Next War', 'Sonnet [Be slowly lifted up]' and"
1264,S. I. W.,'At a Calvary Near the Ancre'--all of which the reader may wish to
1265,S. I. W.,"pursue, being some of Owen's finest work.  Fortunately, the poem which I"
1266,S. I. W.,"consider his best, and which is one of his most quoted--'Dulce et"
1267,S. I. W.,"Decorum est', is included in this volume."
