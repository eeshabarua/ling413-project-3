46,MY INSPIRATION,
47,MY INSPIRATION,"I know that through the waves of air,"
48,MY INSPIRATION,"Some part of all I feel for you,"
49,MY INSPIRATION,"Must surely travel swift and true,"
50,MY INSPIRATION,Towards the heart for which I care
51,MY INSPIRATION,"So dumbly, and before it lay"
52,MY INSPIRATION,The words my lips shall never say.

57,IN A GARDEN,IN A GARDEN
58,IN A GARDEN,
59,IN A GARDEN,
60,IN A GARDEN,"In the garden a thousand roses,"
61,IN A GARDEN,"A vine of jessamine flower,"
62,IN A GARDEN,"Sweetpeas in coquettish poses,"
63,IN A GARDEN,Sweetbrier with its fragrant dower.
64,IN A GARDEN,
65,IN A GARDEN,"There are hollyhocks tall and slender,"
66,IN A GARDEN,"And marigolds gay and fair,"
67,IN A GARDEN,"And sunflowers in glowing splendour,"
68,IN A GARDEN,Geraniums rich and rare;
69,IN A GARDEN,
70,IN A GARDEN,"And the wee, white, innocent daisy,"
71,IN A GARDEN,Half hidden amid the lawn;
72,IN A GARDEN,A bee grown drowsy and lazy—
73,IN A GARDEN,On honey he's drunk since dawn—
74,IN A GARDEN,
75,IN A GARDEN,Is reposing with wings extended
76,IN A GARDEN,"On some soft, passionate rose,"
77,IN A GARDEN,Aglow with a blush more splendid
78,IN A GARDEN,Than ever a fair cheek knows.
79,IN A GARDEN,
80,IN A GARDEN,"While a thrush, in the ivy swinging"
81,IN A GARDEN,"That clusters over the gate,"
82,IN A GARDEN,"Athrob with the spring is singing,"
83,IN A GARDEN,And ardently calls his mate.
84,IN A GARDEN,
85,IN A GARDEN,For the spirit of all sweet odours
86,IN A GARDEN,The soul of a June unborn
87,IN A GARDEN,"Has hallowed my humble garden,"
88,IN A GARDEN,And whispered to me since dawn.
89,IN A GARDEN,
90,IN A GARDEN,"And the flowers in a prayer of rapture,"
91,IN A GARDEN,"Bent low to that spell divine,"
92,IN A GARDEN,Are wafting their sweetest incense
93,IN A GARDEN,"In clouds, at his sunlit shrine."
94,IN A GARDEN,
95,IN A GARDEN,
96,IN A GARDEN,
97,IN A GARDEN,
98,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN
99,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,
100,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,(_Song_)
101,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,
102,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,
103,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,If you were a Rose and I were the Sun
104,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"What then, little girl, what then?"
105,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"I'd kiss you awake when day had begun,"
106,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"My sweet little girl, what then?"
107,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,I'd waken you out of your valley of dreams
108,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"And open your heart with my passionate beams,"
109,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"'Till you lifted your face to my ruddiest gleams,"
110,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"My own little girl, yes then."
111,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,
112,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"If you were the Earth and I were the Dew,"
113,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"What then, little girl, what then?"
114,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"Why surely the thing all lovers would do,"
115,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"My sweet little girl, what then?"
116,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"I'd steal through the twilight, o'er valley and lea,"
117,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"And flood you with kisses, both tender and free"
118,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"'Till the soul in you throbbed with the love that's in me,"
119,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"My own little girl, yes then."
120,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,
121,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"But I am a man and you are a maid,"
122,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"What then, little girl, what then?"
123,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"You're cold in your pride, and I am afraid,"
124,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"My sweet little girl, what then?"
125,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,If you cannot love me and I cannot die
126,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"There's nothing in life but the ghost of a sigh,"
127,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,And the day growing dark 'neath a colourless sky;
128,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,"My own little girl, yes then."
129,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,
130,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,
131,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,
132,IF YOU WERE A ROSE AND I WERE THE SUN,

135,DRIFTING,
136,DRIFTING,"It is sweet to lie in a boat,"
137,DRIFTING,"And drift with the languid stream,"
138,DRIFTING,With body and soul afloat
139,DRIFTING,The lake of a perfect dream.
140,DRIFTING,
141,DRIFTING,"It is sweet in the afternoon,"
142,DRIFTING,"With just the breath of a breeze,"
143,DRIFTING,If the time be the month of June
144,DRIFTING,And the birds sing low in the trees.
145,DRIFTING,
146,DRIFTING,"And the mind has a pleasant thought,"
147,DRIFTING,"And the heart has a fond desire,"
148,DRIFTING,And the soul is a tissue wrought
149,DRIFTING,"Of youth, and it's golden fire."
150,DRIFTING,
151,DRIFTING,"And the limbs are both clean and strong,"
152,DRIFTING,"And able to rest with joy,"
153,DRIFTING,"And our time in the world is long,"
154,DRIFTING,With nothing that can destroy
155,DRIFTING,
156,DRIFTING,"The rapture of God's green earth,"
157,DRIFTING,The throb and the ecstasy
158,DRIFTING,"That springs into life with birth,"
159,DRIFTING,And lives through eternity.

268,SUNLIGHT ON DISTANT HILLS,Over the hills that I see from my room.
269,SUNLIGHT ON DISTANT HILLS,And now the rain and the mist come driving
270,SUNLIGHT ON DISTANT HILLS,"Out of the West, in a cloud of gloom."
271,SUNLIGHT ON DISTANT HILLS,"Over the woods, and meadows, and gardens,"
272,SUNLIGHT ON DISTANT HILLS,Hurries the storm like the hand of Doom.

531,FROM MY SOUL,
532,FROM MY SOUL,"Oh! but to have the gift to put in words,"
533,FROM MY SOUL,"That potent passion, that divine desire,"
534,FROM MY SOUL,That thrills the aching spirit with unrest
535,FROM MY SOUL,And sets the brain on fire.
536,FROM MY SOUL,
537,FROM MY SOUL,"Oh! God, but once to rise above the flesh,"
538,FROM MY SOUL,To breathe our inmost thoughts in one vast sigh
539,FROM MY SOUL,"Of rapture. Oh! to realise ourselves,"
540,FROM MY SOUL,And at that moment ... die.

607,THE MAY TREE,"A garden in the month of May,"
608,THE MAY TREE,The fading of a golden day
609,THE MAY TREE,Upon the tulip flowers.
610,THE MAY TREE,"An anthem sung by little birds,"
611,THE MAY TREE,The sigh more eloquent than words
612,THE MAY TREE,Of earth to listening hours.
613,THE MAY TREE,
614,THE MAY TREE,And shadows ... like the fringe that lies
615,THE MAY TREE,"On cheek, at close of drowsy eyes,"
616,THE MAY TREE,"And paths, grown damp with dew;"
617,THE MAY TREE,"And secret places, where to tread"
618,THE MAY TREE,Were to disturb the bridal bed
619,THE MAY TREE,Of creatures born anew.
620,THE MAY TREE,
621,THE MAY TREE,And fairer than each living thing
622,THE MAY TREE,"That stirs with longings of the Spring,"
623,THE MAY TREE,"A May tree, bearing flower."
624,THE MAY TREE,Like some young nymph the sunlight charms
625,THE MAY TREE,"She stretches forth her slender arms,"
626,THE MAY TREE,New decked with leafy dower.
627,THE MAY TREE,
628,THE MAY TREE,"While through her wondrous, living form"
629,THE MAY TREE,"The sap of life leaps strong and warm,"
630,THE MAY TREE,Awaking from repose
631,THE MAY TREE,"The folded buds to know the Spring,"
632,THE MAY TREE,It seems I almost hear them sing
633,THE MAY TREE,For rapture as it flows.
634,THE MAY TREE,
635,THE MAY TREE,Ay! and it seems as though my heart
636,THE MAY TREE,"Strained upward, but to take some part"
637,THE MAY TREE,In that sweet hymn of praise;
638,THE MAY TREE,"As though my pulses quicker beat,"
639,THE MAY TREE,To see perfection so complete
640,THE MAY TREE,Revealéd to my gaze.
641,THE MAY TREE,
642,THE MAY TREE,As though the problem of unrest
643,THE MAY TREE,"Were solved at last, in this behest"
644,THE MAY TREE,To silently fulfil;

664,PURGATORY,"Her ardent spirit could ascend the blue,"
665,PURGATORY,And force their will.
666,PURGATORY,Such weak old Deities these latter days
667,PURGATORY,Could but comply to her imperious ways.
668,PURGATORY,With woeful doubts they showed the flowery maze
669,PURGATORY,Of rapturous ill.
670,PURGATORY,
671,PURGATORY,And she was happy: with that hot content
672,PURGATORY,"That burns away the flesh, that ravishment"
673,PURGATORY,Of youth grown bold.
674,PURGATORY,Until one morn the roses of her bed
675,PURGATORY,"Were turned to nettles, all the joy was dead,"
676,PURGATORY,The passion cold.

760,AWAKENING,"In unison with Nature's song,"
761,AWAKENING,That echoes tremulous and long
762,AWAKENING,While dawn unfolds.
763,AWAKENING,

2006,X,Why should my throbbing sense rejoice
2007,X,That once has listened to thy voice?
2008,X,
2009,X,Nor do I think that Paradise
2010,X,"Could dim with raptured awe my gaze,"
2011,X,Unfolding to my dazzled eyes—

2014,X,Since I have found thy living heart?

2024,XI,Known unto gods; though I destroy
2025,XI,"All ills, and overcome e'en death"
2026,XI,"Within the vapour of a breath,"
2027,XI,"That from thy lips passed into mine,"
2028,XI,"Fire-tipped, of earth, yet all divine"
2029,XI,"Would be contained more ecstasy,"
2030,XI,To chain the soul eternally
2031,XI,With fetters woven of thy kiss—

2033,XI,Nay more—of Heaven I ask but this.

2089,XIV,"But like a thief steals in the night,"
2090,XIV,You robbed me; what was mine by right
2091,XIV,Your ruthless hands have snatched away;
