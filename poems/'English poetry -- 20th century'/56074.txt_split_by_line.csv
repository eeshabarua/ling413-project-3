83,PAN-WORSHIP,
84,PAN-WORSHIP,In Arcady there lies a crystal spring
85,PAN-WORSHIP,Ring'd all about with green melodious reeds
86,PAN-WORSHIP,Swaying seal'd music up and down the wind.
87,PAN-WORSHIP,Here on its time-defacèd pedestal
88,PAN-WORSHIP,The image of a half-forgotten God
89,PAN-WORSHIP,Crumbles to its complete oblivion.
90,PAN-WORSHIP,The faithful and invariable earth
91,PAN-WORSHIP,"Tilts at the shrine her sacrificial cup,"
92,PAN-WORSHIP,Spilling libations from the brim that runs
93,PAN-WORSHIP,The golden nectar of her daffodils
94,PAN-WORSHIP,And rivulets of summer-breathing flow'rs.
95,PAN-WORSHIP,O evanescent temples built of man
96,PAN-WORSHIP,To deities he honoured and dethroned!
97,PAN-WORSHIP,Earth shoots a trail of her eternal vine
98,PAN-WORSHIP,To crown the head that men have ceased to honour.
99,PAN-WORSHIP,Beneath the coronal of leaf and lichen
100,PAN-WORSHIP,The mocking smile upon the lips derides
101,PAN-WORSHIP,Pan's lost dominion; but the pointed ears
102,PAN-WORSHIP,Are keen and prick'd with old remember'd sounds.
103,PAN-WORSHIP,All my breast aches with longing for the past!
104,PAN-WORSHIP,"Thou God of stone, I have a craving in me"
105,PAN-WORSHIP,For knowledge of thee as thou wert in old
106,PAN-WORSHIP,Enchanted twilights in Arcadia.
107,PAN-WORSHIP,Arcadia! it is the very music
108,PAN-WORSHIP,Of the first spring-tide rippling its first wave
109,PAN-WORSHIP,"Over the naked, laughing baby world ..."
110,PAN-WORSHIP,"Come again, thou sparkling spring-tide, come again,"
111,PAN-WORSHIP,Rush in and flood this autumn from my soul!
112,PAN-WORSHIP,"These waters welling at a dead God's shrine,"
113,PAN-WORSHIP,"These happy waters bubbling limpid kisses,"
114,PAN-WORSHIP,Even with such bright and eager lips made wet
115,PAN-WORSHIP,The hem of the earth's garment in the days
116,PAN-WORSHIP,When earth was youthful and the Gods of Greece
117,PAN-WORSHIP,In starry constellation crowned Olympus.
118,PAN-WORSHIP,What drifting mists have veil'd the Olympian fires?
119,PAN-WORSHIP,What of the Gods of Greece? and what of Greece?
120,PAN-WORSHIP,"O virgin Greece, standing with naked feet"
121,PAN-WORSHIP,In the morning dews of the world against the light
122,PAN-WORSHIP,"Of an infant dawn! old Greece, ever-young Greece,"
123,PAN-WORSHIP,"The pagan in my blood, the instinct in me"
124,PAN-WORSHIP,"That yearns back, back to nature-worship, cries"
125,PAN-WORSHIP,"Aloud to thee! I would stoop to kiss those feet,"
126,PAN-WORSHIP,Sweet white wet feet washed with the earth's first dews:—
127,PAN-WORSHIP,And leaning ear to grass I would re-catch
128,PAN-WORSHIP,Echoes of footsteps sounding down dim ages
129,PAN-WORSHIP,For ever the music once they made on thee:
130,PAN-WORSHIP,"The flaming step of the young Apollo when,"
131,PAN-WORSHIP,With limbs like light and golden locks toss'd back
132,PAN-WORSHIP,"On a smooth ivory shoulder, he avenged"
133,PAN-WORSHIP,His mother's wrongs on Python: the dreaming step
134,PAN-WORSHIP,Of Hylas in the woods of Mysia
135,PAN-WORSHIP,Leading to sleep beneath sweet sylvan waters:
136,PAN-WORSHIP,The laughing step of untrammell'd Atalanta
137,PAN-WORSHIP,Spurning the ground before her golden capture:
138,PAN-WORSHIP,"Child-Proserpina stepping like a flower,"
139,PAN-WORSHIP,And the singing step of Syrinx fleeing—what?
140,PAN-WORSHIP,"If thou couldst speak, neglected, sneering stone,"
141,PAN-WORSHIP,Thou wouldst know how to answer me. Wilt thou
142,PAN-WORSHIP,Not speak?... How still it is!... The noise of the world
143,PAN-WORSHIP,"Is shut about with silence!... If I kneel,"
144,PAN-WORSHIP,"Bend and adore, make sacrifice to thee,"
145,PAN-WORSHIP,If to thy long-deserted fane I bring
146,PAN-WORSHIP,Tribute of milk and honey—then if I snap
147,PAN-WORSHIP,That loveliest pipe of all at the spring's margin
148,PAN-WORSHIP,"And let the song of Syrinx from its hollow,"
149,PAN-WORSHIP,"Nay, even the nymph's sweet self—O Pan, old Pan,"
150,PAN-WORSHIP,"Shall I not see thee stirring in the stone,"
151,PAN-WORSHIP,"Crack thy confinement, leap forth—_be_ again?"
152,PAN-WORSHIP,"I can believe it, master of bright streams,"
153,PAN-WORSHIP,"Lord of green woodlands, king of sun-spread plains"
154,PAN-WORSHIP,And star-splashed hills and valleys drenched in moonlight!
155,PAN-WORSHIP,And I shall see again a dance of Dryads
156,PAN-WORSHIP,And airy shapes of Oreads circling free
157,PAN-WORSHIP,To shy sweet pipings of fantastic fauns
158,PAN-WORSHIP,"And lustier-breathing satyrs ... God of Nature,"
159,PAN-WORSHIP,Thrice hailing thee by name with boisterous lungs
160,PAN-WORSHIP,"I will thrill thee back from the dead ages, thus:"
161,PAN-WORSHIP,_Pan! Pan! O Pan! bring back thy reign again
162,PAN-WORSHIP,Upon the earth!_...
163,PAN-WORSHIP,"Numb pointed ears, ye hear"
164,PAN-WORSHIP,"Only the wash and whisper of far waters,"
165,PAN-WORSHIP,The pale green waters of thin distant Springs
166,PAN-WORSHIP,Under the pale green light of distant moons
167,PAN-WORSHIP,"Washing upon the shores of the old, old world"
168,PAN-WORSHIP,"With a foam of flowers, a foam of whispering flowers...."

178,I,But yesterday the winds of March
179,I,Bent back the barren branches of the larch ...
180,I,But O! to-day
181,I,The bareness from the earth is swept away.
182,I,
183,I,Deep through my swelling breast I hear
184,I,The wild call of the gipsy time o' year—
185,I,"O, Vagrant Spring,"
186,I,"Brother o' mine, I'm for the gipsying!"
187,I,
188,I,The greening earth I stand upon

199,II,Without a single penny.
200,II,
201,II,A king might envy long
202,II,The fare my board adorning—
203,II,Upon a throstle's song
204,II,I broke my fast this morning;
205,II,
206,II,"My lunch, a girl's quick smile,"
207,II,As I'm a living sinner;
208,II,She walked with me a mile ...
209,II,I kissed her for my dinner.
210,II,
211,II,"Of troubles know I none,"

225,III,"Earth, the green Mother!"
226,III,Where shall man live and die
227,III,Having my treasury
228,III,Which never gold could buy—
229,III,Water and air and sky
230,III,And Earth's great sympathy—
231,III,Save he do live as I?
232,III,"Join with me, Brother!"
233,III,
234,III,If you be sickening
235,III,Here's for your quickening!
236,III,Here at the heart of it
237,III,"You shall be part of it,"
238,III,And the good smell of rain
239,III,Shall make you whole again—
240,III,"Join with me, Brother!"
241,III,"Here the life-sap runs green,"
242,III,"Here the life-ways are clean,"
243,III,Here just one bird that sings
244,III,"Re-starts your sluggish springs,"

251,IV,
252,IV,I lay me on the ground
253,IV,"Under the dark,"
254,IV,And Heaven's purple arc
255,IV,Drew its deep curtains round
256,IV,My weary head and shut away the sound.
257,IV,The golden star-lights crept
258,IV,Over the hill ...
259,IV,I lay so very still
260,IV,I heard them as they stepped ...
261,IV,"""Sleep!"" breathed the Earth. Upon her breast I slept."

266,V,"I'll stay one night beneath your roof,"
267,V,"And longer I will stay for no man,"
268,V,"And as for love, I'm loving-proof—"
269,V,"Turn by your eyes, White Woman."
270,V,
271,V,"The Wander-fever's in my blood,"
272,V,I have no time for simple loving—
273,V,"The hot Earth is in roving mood,"
274,V,And I too must be roving.
275,V,
276,V,"_If_ I should love you ... soon, ah, soon"
277,V,"I'd break your heart to go a-roaming,"
278,V,And chasing shadows of the moon
279,V,Think never once of homing.
280,V,
281,V,Why will you wring my breast with tears?
282,V,Tears will not quench the Wander-fever.
283,V,Why will you fill my soul with fears
284,V,When I will go for ever?
285,V,
286,V,I whom the Earth's green passions move
287,V,Have put away all passions human ...
288,V,I will not love!... I _dare_ not love ...
289,V,"Turn by your eyes, White Woman."
290,V,
291,V,
292,VI,VI
293,VI,
294,VI,I went far and cold
295,VI,Over upland wold
296,VI,Where the story of spring's breathing
297,VI,Scarcely yet was told.
298,VI,Shifting monotone
299,VI,Of the pale wind's moan
300,VI,"Through my hair at dusk went wreathing,"
301,VI,And I walked alone.
302,VI,
303,VI,Far below and far
304,VI,Where the homesteads are
305,VI,"One small ruddy candle twinkled,"
306,VI,Warmer than a star.
307,VI,"When the day was gone,"
308,VI,Softly one by one
309,VI,Homing-lights the valley sprinkled ...
310,VI,And I wandered on.

315,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN
316,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,
317,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,(_A Styrian Peasant-Girl Dreams at her Wheel_)
318,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,
319,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,
320,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,King Laurin has a garden of roses
321,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Where warm sweet odours do idly flow
322,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Wave upon wave through the charmèd air ...
323,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,It is sin to wish for the garden of roses
324,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,In the heart of wild mountains where no men go.
325,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,
326,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Laurin is king of a rosy garden.
327,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"The lure of the roses is rare, O rare!"
328,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,They tremble and brighten and throb and glow ...
329,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,I may not think of King Laurin's garden.
330,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"A danger, they tell me, for maids is there."
331,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,
332,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"There are four high gates to the garden of roses,"
333,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"For the treasure of bloom a golden guard,"
334,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,A precious cup for the rose-wine red.
335,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,O the golden gates of the garden of roses!
336,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"They are bright and beautiful, tall and barred."
337,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,
338,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,There is no strong wall round the rosy garden;
339,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"From gate to gate runs a woven thread,"
340,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"Yellow and silken and fine, for ward."
341,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Who snaps the ward of the rosy garden
342,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"With his hand and his foot shall he pay, 'tis said."
343,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,
344,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Laurin who rules the garden of roses
345,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"Is an elf-king, therefore he has no soul."
346,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,(_The good priest shudders at Laurin's name._)
347,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Poor soulless elf of the garden of roses!
348,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Shall I pray for King Laurin at Vesper-toll?
349,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,
350,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,They say no prayers in the rosy garden
351,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Where life is the flash of a fragrant flame
352,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Like the heart of a flower on fire: the whole
353,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Of forbidden sweet is the rosy garden
354,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,I may not think of and feel no shame.
355,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,
356,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,For in King Laurin's garden of roses
357,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"Waking thought shall be stilled asleep,"
358,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,And the still heart dream itself half-awake ...
359,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"O the soft, soft dreams of the garden of roses!"
360,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,They creep ... (_I look not_) ... but they steal and creep.
361,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,
362,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Laurin the king of the rosy garden
363,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Has a magic girdle that none can break.
364,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,It makes the pulse of his life to leap
365,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,With twelve men's strength. In the rosy garden
366,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,He is feared and feared for the girdle's sake.
367,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,
368,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Laurin the king of the garden of roses
369,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Has a magic crown where strange birds so sing
370,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,That resistance and doubt by their song once kissed
371,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Melt into trance. In the garden of roses
372,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,He is loved and loved for his crowned bird-ring.
373,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,
374,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Laurin the king of the rosy garden
375,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"Has a magic cloak the colour of mist,"
376,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,And he goes invisibly wandering
377,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Far from the bourne of the rosy garden
378,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Like a cloud of pearl and of amethyst.
379,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,
380,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"He seeks a bride for his garden of roses,"
381,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,For the soulless spirit a human girl ...
382,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,(_The priest bids me wear my cross and pray_) ...
383,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,He will bear her back to his garden of roses
384,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,In the mist of his magic grey-and-pearl.
385,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,
386,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"Kunhild was borne to the rosy garden,"
387,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"The sister of Dietrich of Bern, one day."
388,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"A fair green mead and a cloud's dim swirl,"
389,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,And Kunhild awoke in the rosy garden ...
390,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"But she stood by a linden-tree first, they say."
391,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,
392,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,*       *       *       *       *
393,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,
394,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,_King Laurin has a garden of roses
395,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Full of warm odours_ ... I'll sit and spin
396,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,As my Mother bids me ... _O wine-red glow
397,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,Of half-waked dreams in the garden of roses_ ...
398,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,"Spin, wheel!... _fine thread, bright like silk, and thin_."
399,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,
400,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,_A grey mist steals from the rosy garden
401,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,In the heart of wild mountains where no men go_ ...
402,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,To think of the garden they say is sin—
403,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,I'll dream no more of King Laurin's garden ...
404,KING LAURIN'S GARDEN,_See! in our meadow green lindens grow_....

415,THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST,Was a world of wraiths and shadows.
416,THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST,
417,THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST,"The dim trees beckoned, beckoned with their branches,"
418,THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST,"I said: ""The sun's behind me on the meadows."""
419,THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST,"A dim voice calling, calling through the branches"
420,THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST,From the world of wraiths and shadows.
421,THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST,
422,THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST,"I saw a pale young Queen, her eyes were mournful,"
423,THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST,Steal ghostwise ... is the sun yet on the meadows?...
424,THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST,More phantoms passed and all their eyes were mournful
425,THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST,In the world of wraiths and shadows.
426,THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST,
427,THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST,"I see a blue light in the mysterious forest,"
428,THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST,The cold night lies behind me on the meadows.
429,THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST,The branches beckon in the mysterious forest ...
430,THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST,"They beckon, beckon, beckon, call and beckon"

439,THE OLD GREY QUEEN,The Princess looked from the old grey tower;
440,THE OLD GREY QUEEN,She was a-weary of being there.
441,THE OLD GREY QUEEN,"She wore no crown but her own gold hair,"
442,THE OLD GREY QUEEN,"And the old grey Queen had shut her there,"
443,THE OLD GREY QUEEN,She was so like a flower.
444,THE OLD GREY QUEEN,
445,THE OLD GREY QUEEN,"""The young King's-Son comes over the sea"
446,THE OLD GREY QUEEN,"From the West,"" said the Queen who was grey and old."
447,THE OLD GREY QUEEN,"""In an unlit hall were not grey as gold?"
448,THE OLD GREY QUEEN,In an unlit hall what are young and old?
449,THE OLD GREY QUEEN,"We'll greet i' the dark,"" said she."
450,THE OLD GREY QUEEN,
451,THE OLD GREY QUEEN,The Princess looked from the old grey tower ...
452,THE OLD GREY QUEEN,Lo! a milk-white sail on the sunlit ocean.
453,THE OLD GREY QUEEN,"Fluttered her heart to its fluttering motion,"
454,THE OLD GREY QUEEN,And the King's-Son looked from the golden ocean ...

530,THE MAN'S SIDE,
531,THE MAN'S SIDE,Two years I have lived in a dream
532,THE MAN'S SIDE,And have dared not to end it—
533,THE MAN'S SIDE,Owned wealth in a measure supreme
534,THE MAN'S SIDE,And been fearful to spend it.
535,THE MAN'S SIDE,
536,THE MAN'S SIDE,"You, woman of beauty and love"
537,THE MAN'S SIDE,"In such noble wise fashioned,"
538,THE MAN'S SIDE,Are my dreams and my rich treasure-trove.
539,THE MAN'S SIDE,"I am shamed that, impassioned,"
540,THE MAN'S SIDE,
541,THE MAN'S SIDE,In secret I levy demands
542,THE MAN'S SIDE,Upon more than you've given—
543,THE MAN'S SIDE,"Crave yourself, heart and soul, eyes and hands,"
544,THE MAN'S SIDE,Which in sum make up heaven.
545,THE MAN'S SIDE,
546,THE MAN'S SIDE,"Unconscious of aught, through these days"
547,THE MAN'S SIDE,"You have let me be near you,"
548,THE MAN'S SIDE,Knowing not how your thousand sweet ways
549,THE MAN'S SIDE,Only serve to endear you
550,THE MAN'S SIDE,
551,THE MAN'S SIDE,"To all in your orbit who move,"
552,THE MAN'S SIDE,In such innocence wronging
553,THE MAN'S SIDE,As friendship what really is love
554,THE MAN'S SIDE,And unsatisfied longing.
555,THE MAN'S SIDE,
556,THE MAN'S SIDE,"Yet, your friendship—to be just your friend—"
557,THE MAN'S SIDE,"So caps love in another,"
558,THE MAN'S SIDE,"That I would my love, burned to its end,"
559,THE MAN'S SIDE,"In its own smoke might smother,"
560,THE MAN'S SIDE,
561,THE MAN'S SIDE,Lest I in an outbreak one day
562,THE MAN'S SIDE,Ask of friendship aught stronger—
563,THE MAN'S SIDE,When you may forbid me to say
564,THE MAN'S SIDE,"Even ""friend"" any longer."
565,THE MAN'S SIDE,
566,THE MAN'S SIDE,"So I come in the old way and go,"
567,THE MAN'S SIDE,While my heart's quickened beatings
568,THE MAN'S SIDE,"Are hidden, and you never know"
569,THE MAN'S SIDE,What I glean from our meetings;
570,THE MAN'S SIDE,
571,THE MAN'S SIDE,"How a word, a look even, which seems"
572,THE MAN'S SIDE,"So unconsciously meted,"
573,THE MAN'S SIDE,Builds new dreams on the wreckage of dreams
574,THE MAN'S SIDE,That were never completed.
575,THE MAN'S SIDE,
576,THE MAN'S SIDE,You once dropped a flower—did not see
577,THE MAN'S SIDE,That I hid in my bosom
578,THE MAN'S SIDE,"What was more than Golconda to me,"
579,THE MAN'S SIDE,And to you a bruised blossom.
580,THE MAN'S SIDE,
581,THE MAN'S SIDE,Ten seconds I once held your hand
582,THE MAN'S SIDE,While you pulled from the river
583,THE MAN'S SIDE,A lily. Could you understand
584,THE MAN'S SIDE,Why my own hand should quiver?
585,THE MAN'S SIDE,
586,THE MAN'S SIDE,Small matters these things you account
587,THE MAN'S SIDE,"Who so lightly diffuse them,"
588,THE MAN'S SIDE,But to all my life's joy they amount—
589,THE MAN'S SIDE,"And my fear is, to lose them."
590,THE MAN'S SIDE,
591,THE MAN'S SIDE,"One day, when your eyes are still kind"
592,THE MAN'S SIDE,"And your voice is still tender,"
593,THE MAN'S SIDE,"I shall slip the control of my mind,"
594,THE MAN'S SIDE,"All my future surrender,"
595,THE MAN'S SIDE,
596,THE MAN'S SIDE,Obeying the primal desire
597,THE MAN'S SIDE,"To fall down and adore you,"
598,THE MAN'S SIDE,And outpour in one instant of fire
599,THE MAN'S SIDE,All the love I have for you.
600,THE MAN'S SIDE,
601,THE MAN'S SIDE,"'Twill be death, and far worse, at your feet"
602,THE MAN'S SIDE,When my lips cease to blunder
603,THE MAN'S SIDE,And I look up your dear eyes to meet
604,THE MAN'S SIDE,Overrunning with wonder.
605,THE MAN'S SIDE,
606,THE MAN'S SIDE,"Thereafter—what? Nothing, I fear—"
607,THE MAN'S SIDE,Even dreams will have vanished
608,THE MAN'S SIDE,When I by my act from your sphere
609,THE MAN'S SIDE,Shall for ever be banished.
610,THE MAN'S SIDE,
611,THE MAN'S SIDE,"Dear, that is the moment I dread—"
612,THE MAN'S SIDE,"When you hear my confession,"
613,THE MAN'S SIDE,When the word I withhold has been said
614,THE MAN'S SIDE,And my love finds expression;
615,THE MAN'S SIDE,
616,THE MAN'S SIDE,But till then (and God knows how I seek
617,THE MAN'S SIDE,"To postpone and postpone it),"
618,THE MAN'S SIDE,"Till my love grows too strong, lips too weak"
619,THE MAN'S SIDE,"To much longer disown it,"
620,THE MAN'S SIDE,
621,THE MAN'S SIDE,"I shall come, if I may, day by day,"
622,THE MAN'S SIDE,"My small gleanings to gather,"
623,THE MAN'S SIDE,While you think of me—how shall we say?
624,THE MAN'S SIDE,As a brother or father;
625,THE MAN'S SIDE,
626,THE MAN'S SIDE,"And you never will guess, till you learn"
627,THE MAN'S SIDE,"From a heart brimming over,"
628,THE MAN'S SIDE,That I've met you at every turn
629,THE MAN'S SIDE,As a passionate lover.

637,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"Men—you, too, being a man—have called you strong,"
638,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"A doer of big deeds, great acts. But they are wrong."
639,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,
640,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"You lack in courage. I, being woman, know"
641,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"How often woman shapes man's enterprises,"

643,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,Lest he should chafe too large a debt to owe—
644,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,Strikes every blow up to the very hundredth blow
645,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,
646,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"That shall at last resolve, achieve, complete"
647,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"The foregone nine-and-ninety. This, grown wiser,"
648,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,She leaves with him for fear he should despise her.
649,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,_He_ wins the credit for the final feat—
650,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"Thought of _his_ triumph, not hers, made all her toiling sweet."
651,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,
652,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"Belov'd, how long before you understand?"
653,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"Why, I have known two years you were my lover,"
654,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,That all my being to yours was given over!
655,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,The thing your heart most yearns for lies at hand
656,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"Awaiting only this, that you shall make demand."
657,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,
658,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,Have I not worked for all betwixt us two
659,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"Since first I saw your love spring into being,"
660,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,And you became too faint of heart for seeing
661,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"That the one peach you longed to garner grew,"
662,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"Ripened, and mellowed here only for you, for you?"
663,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,
664,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,You would have drawn abashed from out my life
665,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,Had I permitted; it became _my_ mission
666,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,To bring the golden moment to fruition
667,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"Through, ah, how many hours of wistful strife"
668,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"With you, who guessed not, even, the tender struggle rife"
669,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,
670,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"Between us. When I met you with a smile,"
671,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"""Love's not for me,"" you thought, ""yet while she kindly"
672,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"Still looks and speaks, I'll stay."" And went thus blindly"
673,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,Taking for innocence what sprang from guile
674,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,That I might hold you by me just a little while.
675,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,
676,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"The day I dropped a flower upon the path,"
677,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,Did you not know it was the thing I aimed for
678,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,When you behind me loitered (somewhat lamed for
679,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"A good excuse), secured it free from scath"
680,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"And hid it close, to reap therefrom love's aftermath"
681,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,
682,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"In hours when I was absent? Why, I _meant_,"
683,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"Belov'd, that you should have this one flower-treasure"
684,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"(Stolen, you thought!) out of my heart's full measure—"
685,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,Meant that your solitary nights be spent
686,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,Cheek to its petals pressed where all my love lay pent.
687,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,
688,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"And then, the day you helped me from the boat,"
689,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"""It is but chance,"" you thought, ""I hold her fingers"
690,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"In mine past custom's limit, while she lingers"
691,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"To cull the waterlily there afloat."""
692,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"It was not chance, belov'd. And still you would not note."
693,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,
694,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"I have done all a woman may do, dear,"
695,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"With eyes and hands and tones of voice have spoken,"
696,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,In all but words have given you the token
697,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,And seal of love. What is it then you fear?
698,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"Can you not take one step, the goal being now so near?"
699,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,
700,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"Just the last word to utter, just the last"
701,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,Step to be taken—it is very little!
702,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,Can you believe Love's structure is so brittle?
703,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,All I have builded in these two years past
704,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,Fall tottering at one word? It is of stronger cast.
705,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,
706,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,You would not have me speak. That part is yours.
707,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,My share is finished and I wait for you now.
708,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,The time to act has come—what will you do now?
709,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"Dear, even I'd say the word that all ensures"
710,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,But that were more than love itself of love endures.
711,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,
712,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,"I had to spend my strength when you were weak,"
713,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,Be guide along the road from its beginning
714,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,To the last barrier. Am I worth the winning?
715,THE WOMAN'S SIDE,But _you_ must turn the key. It will not creak.

1037,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,"The veil of dead smiles and forgotten tears,"
1038,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,I think I can picture a little maid
1039,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,"Crowned with plaits of gold,"
1040,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,Passing alone down each green arcade
1041,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,While the sundial told
1042,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,In silence its hours of shine and shade.
1043,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,"Young she was as the peep of dawn,"
1044,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,And as a year-old dappled fawn
1045,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,Was shy and tender and innocent.
1046,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,And all her days were in waiting spent
1047,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,Amongst her flowers in a day-dream she
1048,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,Builded herself. So continuously
1049,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,In waiting and waiting the days went by—
1050,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,"We know what she waited, love, you and I."
1051,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,The flowers had nothing to teach to her—
1052,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,"In her sleep she could hear the grasses stir,"
1053,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,"She had secrets with every rose in the place,"
1054,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,"The lilies kept smiles for her lily-face,"

1059,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,"As surely as we know why, she knew."
1060,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,"And so in her house of dreams she grew,"

1078,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,When he was the hero of all their lore.
1079,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,"Hand in hand they go as of old,"
1080,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,"He brave and bold,"
1081,DWELLERS IN THE GARDEN,She crowned with gold.

1325,THE WANING YEAR,
1326,THE WANING YEAR,"Two little things, dear, I have seen"
1327,THE WANING YEAR,To-day that overflowed my breast with sorrow—
1328,THE WANING YEAR,We may not stay here many another morrow.
1329,THE WANING YEAR,
1330,THE WANING YEAR,"Amongst the leafage, by its green"
1331,THE WANING YEAR,"Still-living sisters tenderly enfolden,"
1332,THE WANING YEAR,I saw one single leaf grown dry and golden.
1333,THE WANING YEAR,
1334,THE WANING YEAR,And down the alleys of the rose
1335,THE WANING YEAR,"Passing, I saw one lightly breathed-on blossom"
1336,THE WANING YEAR,Fall instantly deflowered to earth's brown bosom.
1337,THE WANING YEAR,
1338,THE WANING YEAR,Compassionate summer ere she goes
1339,THE WANING YEAR,Strikes tender notes surcharged with wistful warnings ...
1340,THE WANING YEAR,"Dear heart, we must begone ere many mornings."
1341,THE WANING YEAR,
1342,THE WANING YEAR,
1343,SHADOWS,SHADOWS
1344,SHADOWS,
1345,SHADOWS,"We thought we were here alone,"
1346,SHADOWS,Had spent our summer of love
1347,SHADOWS,"By all other hearts unknown,"
1348,SHADOWS,Of all other eyes unseen—
1349,SHADOWS,But something came to disprove
1350,SHADOWS,Last night what we thought had been.
1351,SHADOWS,
1352,SHADOWS,The shadows fell one by one—
1353,SHADOWS,We have watched them fall before
1354,SHADOWS,And fancied ourselves alone;
1355,SHADOWS,But they seemed to waver and move
1356,SHADOWS,"Last night, and to wander o'er"
1357,SHADOWS,Our green-tented couch of love.
1358,SHADOWS,
1359,SHADOWS,"You were asleep, and I"
1360,SHADOWS,Would not disturb your dreams
1361,SHADOWS,Lest the shadowy shapes should fly.
1362,SHADOWS,I saw them gather and mount
1363,SHADOWS,In ever-increasing streams—
1364,SHADOWS,More lovers than I could count.
1365,SHADOWS,
1366,SHADOWS,They circled around our bed
1367,SHADOWS,And watched us a little while
1368,SHADOWS,From the sides and foot and head;
1369,SHADOWS,And some of that shadow-band
1370,SHADOWS,"Were wistful, and some would smile,"
1371,SHADOWS,But all seemed to understand.
1372,SHADOWS,
1373,SHADOWS,Then I felt light fingers twine
1374,SHADOWS,"In my hair, and soft breath enwreathe"
1375,SHADOWS,My brow ... lips were laid to mine ...
1376,SHADOWS,"But none of the hands was this,"
1377,SHADOWS,"Nor the breath the breath you breathe,"
1378,SHADOWS,The kisses were not your kiss.
1379,SHADOWS,
1380,SHADOWS,Then ... you turned on your side to press
1381,SHADOWS,More close with the smile that slips
1382,SHADOWS,"From its hiding at my caress,"
1383,SHADOWS,And you breathed my name in my ear
1384,SHADOWS,As though I had kissed your lips ...
1385,SHADOWS,"But I had not kissed you, dear."

1388,THE LAST NIGHT,THE LAST NIGHT
1389,THE LAST NIGHT,
1390,THE LAST NIGHT,"Well, is it done? is it over?"
1391,THE LAST NIGHT,"Three months in these groves I have been your lover,"
1392,THE LAST NIGHT,Added my voice to the echoing chorus
1393,THE LAST NIGHT,Of those who loved here before us.
1394,THE LAST NIGHT,
1395,THE LAST NIGHT,We have pressed the paths made sweet
1396,THE LAST NIGHT,"By the pressure of bygone lovers' feet,"
1397,THE LAST NIGHT,Have lain amid flowerless violet-beds
1398,THE LAST NIGHT,Where they laid their happy heads;
1399,THE LAST NIGHT,
1400,THE LAST NIGHT,We have flung a red-rose petal
1401,THE LAST NIGHT,"On the glass of the pond and watched it settle,"
1402,THE LAST NIGHT,Then drift like a boat down one of her streams
1403,THE LAST NIGHT,With our cargo of hopes and dreams.
1404,THE LAST NIGHT,
1405,THE LAST NIGHT,"So many have come and gone,"
1406,THE LAST NIGHT,Have done the things which we two have done:
1407,THE LAST NIGHT,"Have leaned in revery sweet and solemn,"
1408,THE LAST NIGHT,"Hands laced, on the sundial's column:"
1409,THE LAST NIGHT,
1410,THE LAST NIGHT,Have found their three months as brief
1411,THE LAST NIGHT,"As the life of a blade of grass, a leaf—"
1412,THE LAST NIGHT,"As eternal, too, as the leafage is"
1413,THE LAST NIGHT,Have found their three months of bliss.
1414,THE LAST NIGHT,
1415,THE LAST NIGHT,For us it is finished and over.
1416,THE LAST NIGHT,Our three months are spent when as lover and lover
1417,THE LAST NIGHT,"We may roam these groves. But to-night we are nearest,"
1418,THE LAST NIGHT,"This being our last night, dearest,"
1419,THE LAST NIGHT,
1420,THE LAST NIGHT,The spirits of those who wander
1421,THE LAST NIGHT,"Near our lily-pond, by our sundial yonder,"
1422,THE LAST NIGHT,"In our rose-realm ... Farewells are not easily spoken,"
1423,THE LAST NIGHT,So their silence remains unbroken.
1424,THE LAST NIGHT,
1425,THE LAST NIGHT,But I see through a mist of tears
1426,THE LAST NIGHT,"This garden after a million years,"
1427,THE LAST NIGHT,Where two shades more move eternally ...
1428,THE LAST NIGHT,"Heart of mine, they are you and I."

1438,I,I
1439,I,
1440,I,They were gathered up in the moods
1441,I,Which I found in the solitudes
1442,I,"Of the shore and the fields and the woods,"
1443,I,"Of the dawn and the noon and the even,"
1444,I,Of the earth and the sea and of heaven.
1445,I,"And some lack rhythm and metre,"
1446,I,"And none of the songs is sweeter,"
1447,I,Or as sweet (by the infinite span
1448,I,Which divides the work of man
1449,I,"From the work of his God), as the thing"
1450,I,Which was the fountain and spring
1451,I,Whence my heart drew its need to sing.
1452,I,But because wherever I went
1453,I,Much song in my heart was pent:
1454,I,Because the sea and the sky
1455,I,Filled my breast with such melody:
1456,I,Because the woodlands and all
1457,I,God's earth became musical
1458,I,As they entered into my soul:
1459,I,Because I captured the whole
1460,I,Of Nature for my possession:
1461,I,I sang just to find expression
1462,I,For the joy and the love and the pride of it—
1463,I,Else all song in me might have died of it.
1464,I,
1465,I,
1466,II,II
1467,II,
1468,II,The infinite sky overhead
1469,II,And on the horizon
1470,II,The infinite sea.
1471,II,Green billowing grass for my bed—
1472,II,At last I am out of my prison
1473,II,And free!
1474,II,
1475,II,"An insect creeps over my page,"
1476,II,An infinite mite
1477,II,With all life folded under its wings.
1478,II,"I am of no sex, of no age,"
1479,II,Here out of sight
1480,II,"Of the world, all alone with God's infinite things."
1481,II,
1482,II,"Oh, the world of small leafage"
1483,II,"Peopling the bank where I lean,"
1484,II,And the one white daisy
1485,II,With its wisdom of things supernal.
1486,II,"They live out their brief age,"
1487,II,"Brief but eternal,"
1488,II,And time itself recedes and grows hazy
1489,II,In this little infinite world of green.
1490,II,
1491,II,Behind me the copse
1492,II,Like a round cup dips
1493,II,"Filled with a pool of soft shadows,"
1494,II,And to me in the meadows
1495,II,One shy bird-voice from the tree-top drips
1496,II,And into the hollow of shadows it melts and drops.
1497,II,
1498,II,They are all around me
1499,II,"And all above me,"
1500,II,"Half-seen, half-heard,"
1501,II,"Flower and leaf and insect and bird,"
1502,II,"Wild, timid creatures,"
1503,II,Simple and friendly and shy;
1504,II,And so still I lie
1505,II,Where they have found me
1506,II,"That I think in time they may learn to love me,"
1507,II,For they are Nature's
1508,II,And so am I.
1509,II,
1510,II,"One by one she unfolds each feature,"
1511,II,The Infinite Mother
1512,II,To her child.
1513,II,"There was a new bird-call,"
1514,II,And there was another!
1515,II,I too shall learn to grow simple and shy and wild ...
1516,II,"Only Nature and Nature and nothing but Nature,"
1517,II,And I alone in the heart of it all.

1522,III,"They who dwell in the southlands say,"
1523,III,"Little green England of mine, that you"
1524,III,"Are misty and colourless, cold and grey."
1525,III,If it be true
1526,III,"And they can know it who dwell afar,"
1527,III,You only are grey as diamonds are.
1528,III,
1529,III,To-day in the warm soft evening light
1530,III,You are a zone of delicate tints;
1531,III,"On the rim of the sea the sun is bright,"
1532,III,And shoots and glints
1533,III,Sparkles of gold through its splendid blue.
1534,III,Who say you are colourless know not you.
1535,III,
1536,III,Opal gleams on the sunset sky
1537,III,Where a wave of the liquid sapphire flows;
1538,III,One bright cloud on its flood drifts by
1539,III,Of pearl and rose;
1540,III,The air is radiant and crystalline
1541,III,As rare jewels delved from a fairy mine.
1542,III,
1543,III,A breeze just shivers the green of the corn
1544,III,And sweeps it into a silver sea;
1545,III,Infinite sensitive shades new-born
1546,III,On hill and lea
1547,III,Over the land's lap flit and pass
1548,III,Like elusive tints in Venetian glass
1549,III,
1550,III,"Nature has painted you in pastel,"
1551,III,"You are her palette of tender hues,"
1552,III,"Little green England of mine, where dwell"
1553,III,"Change, and infuse,"
1554,III,"The million lights of the polar-star,"
1555,III,And you only are grey as diamonds are.

1559,IV,
1560,IV,If I could unravel
1561,IV,"The music of the grass,"
1562,IV,Beyond those confines travel
1563,IV,"Which mortals cannot pass,"
1564,IV,I think that I should capture all
1565,IV,The secret of things musical—
1566,IV,"All music ever will be, and all it ever was."
1567,IV,
1568,IV,Ear close to earth inclining
1569,IV,I hear her wordless song
1570,IV,Of threads past man's divining
1571,IV,Woven the grass among.
1572,IV,"Beneath these fragrant, tangled weeds"
1573,IV,She sings the strain to which her seeds
1574,IV,"March into life, push upward to heaven, and grow strong."
1575,IV,
1576,IV,Then like a voice replying
1577,IV,Follows her cradle-croon
1578,IV,"Lulling tired things that, dying,"
1579,IV,Back to their Mother swoon.
1580,IV,For where the worlds of grasses spring
1581,IV,"Both life and death their choral sing,"
1582,IV,The spheres' eternal roundel circling an afternoon.
1583,IV,
1584,IV,The music of existence
1585,IV,Moves underneath my ear—
1586,IV,From how remote a distance
1587,IV,Comes that which sounds so near!
1588,IV,Could I the human barrier pass
1589,IV,By the fine measure of one grass
1590,IV,I then might comprehend what now I only hear.
1591,IV,
1592,IV,There's such melodious stirring
1593,IV,"Of hidden, secret things,"
1594,IV,There's such harmonious whirring
1595,IV,Of faint mysterious wings;
1596,IV,And underneath this leaf is curled
1597,IV,"The song, I think, of all the world—"
1598,IV,"Up-turned, should I discover the seed from which it springs?"
1599,IV,
1600,IV,If I could unravel
1601,IV,"The music of the grass,"
1602,IV,Beyond those confines travel
1603,IV,"Which mortals cannot pass,"
1604,IV,I think that I should capture all
1605,IV,The secret of things musical—

1609,V,V
1610,V,
1611,V,Hark!
1612,V,"It is afternoon,"
1613,V,Yet that must be a lark.
1614,V,No other bird flies up so high
1615,V,And shakes its sparkling spray of song
1616,V,"Through the grey clouds in the sky,"
1617,V,No other bird has just that thrilling
1618,V,"Note in trilling,"
1619,V,Or can sustain so long
1620,V,Its liquid flood of mirth:
1621,V,As rare a boon
1622,V,To thirsty ears as God's dew is to earth.
1623,V,Yet it is afternoon.
1624,V,"I thought the larks, all scorning"
1625,V,"The jaded hours, sang only in the morning."
1626,V,"And I, whose first flushed youth is going,"
1627,V,Who watch the swift noon growing
1628,V,"Upon me, hour by hour,"
1629,V,Feeling that I must always stand apart
1630,V,"From earth's sweet singers, because I lacked the pow'r"
1631,V,To loose the morning song-burst from my heart—
1632,V,"Oh, songster of the mellowing hour of day,"
1633,V,"Shall I, too, late or soon,"
1634,V,Learn from your throat the way
1635,V,To loose my power of song even in my afternoon?
1636,V,
1637,V,
1638,VI,VI
1639,VI,
1640,VI,The day was a lifeless day.
1641,VI,Under a tree I lay
1642,VI,And round me its branches bent
1643,VI,Touching the earth like a tent.
1644,VI,There was no stir of breeze;
1645,VI,"I was shut in with trees,"
1646,VI,Locked from the world by these;
1647,VI,"Dead leaves were piled on the ground,"
1648,VI,"And the forest lay in a swound,"
1649,VI,"Throbbed with nor pulse nor breath,"
1650,VI,"And I thought: ""It is waiting Death."""
1651,VI,"So I lay there, still and oppressed,"
1652,VI,While the silence grew in my breast.
1653,VI,
1654,VI,Presently as I lay
1655,VI,I heard from far away
1656,VI,Little pattering feet
1657,VI,Over the dry leaves beat;
1658,VI,"Tripping along pell-mell,"
1659,VI,Thicker and faster they fell
1660,VI,Than tongue could count or tell.
1661,VI,And I fancied the birds and deer
1662,VI,"And rabbits, too awed for fear,"
1663,VI,Were creeping my aid to plead
1664,VI,Impelled by our common need—
1665,VI,Till into my sheltered place
1666,VI,One raindrop splashed on my face.
1667,VI,
1668,VI,I lay there tented and dry
1669,VI,"While the dews, dropped out of the sky,"
1670,VI,Made music upon the sheaves
1671,VI,Of last year's stacked-up leaves—
1672,VI,"No steps of wild things that trod,"
1673,VI,But the whispering voice of God
1674,VI,"In grave commune with the sod,"
1675,VI,Messenger-angels rife
1676,VI,"With words not of Death but Life,"
1677,VI,Bidding the old brown Earth
1678,VI,Prepare for her great re-birth
1679,VI,And look to Heaven in pride
1680,VI,Renewed and revivified.
1681,VI,
1682,VI,Then I heard far under the soil
1683,VI,"The seedlings stir and toil,"
1684,VI,And blade and bulb and root
1685,VI,"Put forth each one new shoot,"
1686,VI,And I felt deep down and deep
1687,VI,A million pulses leap
1688,VI,"Out of their term of sleep,"
1689,VI,And I thought the acorn spoke
1690,VI,"With the voice of the full-grown oak,"
1691,VI,And the cone wore the crown divine
1692,VI,"Of the red-stemmed, crested pine,"
1693,VI,And the haw held all the blush
1694,VI,And bloom of the wild-rose bush.
1695,VI,
1696,VI,What helped these young things to grow?
1697,VI,"Dead leaves of a year ago,"
1698,VI,Leaves heaped up in their crowds
1699,VI,And spread like funeral-shrouds;
1700,VI,Yet life sprang out of their death
1701,VI,"As the blade slips out of its sheath,"
1702,VI,Life was fostered beneath
1703,VI,The leaves here rotting away
1704,VI,And emerged from their decay.
1705,VI,Are all things that seem to die
1706,VI,"Renewed to infinity,"
1707,VI,And the bodies and souls of men
1708,VI,Made and re-made again?
1709,VI,
1710,VI,With the scent of the rain-wet loam
1711,VI,"In my nostrils, I turned me home."
1712,VI,
1713,VI,
1714,VII,VII
1715,VII,
1716,VII,"I lay on the shore beside the sea,"
1717,VII,And the young moon climbed the hill of the sky
1718,VII,And paused a space to look down on me
1719,VII,Alone with my misery
1720,VII,
1721,VII,Then on the fallow blue fields above
1722,VII,The young moon sowed its seed of stars;
1723,VII,Light gleamed from the mirror of her named Love
1724,VII,And flashed from the shield of Mars.
1725,VII,
1726,VII,The stars sprang up from the silver seed
1727,VII,Wherever that silver sower trod.
1728,VII,Through the windows of heaven watching my need
1729,VII,I knew them the eyes of God.
1730,VII,
1731,VII,Little blue waves with blown foam capped
1732,VII,Crept on the solitary shore
1733,VII,Which the sea's white lips still licked and lapped
1734,VII,For ever and evermore.
1735,VII,
1736,VII,The silver moon waxed strong and older;
1737,VII,I thought I saw it stop to fling
1738,VII,A silver sickle over its shoulder
1739,VII,And commence its harvesting.
1740,VII,
1741,VII,"The strong moon ploughed through the fields of heaven,"
1742,VII,Its eternal labour but half-begun.
1743,VII,My breast dropped its load of earthy leaven
1744,VII,As the stars dropped one by one.
1745,VII,
1746,VII,"I had sat there hugging my trivial cross,"
1747,VII,"My infinitesimal mortal pains,"
1748,VII,Reckoning up how my mortal loss
1749,VII,Outmeasured my mortal gains.
1750,VII,
1751,VII,I saw the moon reaping God's blue fields
1752,VII,Night after night sown thick with seeds.
1753,VII,I saw the crop which God's harvest yields
1754,VII,"Not in men's dreams, but deeds."
1755,VII,
1756,VII,"The old moon climbed down the hill of the sky,"
1757,VII,The strong young day flashed up in flame.
1758,VII,"The moon dropped into the sea, and I"
1759,VII,Bowed down my head in shame.

1795,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"""Phœbus-Apollo, how shall this thing be?"""
1796,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"I said: ""I slew a smith, a monstrous clod,"
1797,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Not God or mortal, one that had done evil."
1798,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"I am the avenger of evil among the Gods,"
1799,APOLLO IN PHERAE,For this one and for that I have stretched my bow
1800,APOLLO IN PHERAE,And winged my arrow through the heart of Wrong;
1801,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"But this was evil done unto myself,"
1802,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"And Vengeance wore the sleek face of Advantage,"
1803,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Wherefor Zeus robs me of my Godhead, King,"
1804,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"And I will be thy shepherd for a year."""
1805,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"He stood half wonderstruck, half shamed-protesting,"
1806,APOLLO IN PHERAE,But I bade him bring me out among his flocks
1807,APOLLO IN PHERAE,And speak no more.
1808,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"""I will have peace,"" I said."
1809,APOLLO IN PHERAE,
1810,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"""Fear not, and bid thy people not to fear;"
1811,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"For I am worn with too much strife and passion,"
1812,APOLLO IN PHERAE,And no more hurt shall come from that I do.
1813,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Thou shalt not suffer by this term of service,"
1814,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"But see thy lands grow rich and bountiful,"
1815,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"And where thou lov'st I'll win thy love for thee,"
1816,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"And life shall prosper with thee,"
1817,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"""Life is sweet!"
1818,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Make it not too sweet, God, lest when death come"
1819,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"It look more bitter than my soul can bear."""
1820,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"""Even death, Admetos, I'll delay for thee."
1821,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Now, peace! I am done with vengeance for a space."""
1822,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Thus I am come again upon the earth
1823,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Even as a common man ...
1824,APOLLO IN PHERAE,_Asklepios!_
1825,APOLLO IN PHERAE,
1826,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"The people eye me timidly, and dare"
1827,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Not consort with the God they may not worship.
1828,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Even so it was in those first days of life
1829,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"When I was a boy in Delos with my Mother,"
1830,APOLLO IN PHERAE,And only half aware I was a God.
1831,APOLLO IN PHERAE,O this unconquerable loneliness
1832,APOLLO IN PHERAE,That binds the crown of Godhead on our brows!
1833,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Yet easier the aloofness of the people
1834,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Than the familiar face of the half-God Pan.
1835,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"I met in the woods the brute-divinity,"
1836,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Who fleered an impudent hoof, a satyr-smile"
1837,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Licking his lips:
1838,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"""What, Helios! is the sun"
1839,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Debased to something lower than the earth?
1840,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"What! are we two, I of the beast's grain, thou"
1841,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"The delicate, disdainful spirit of flame,"
1842,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"The seed of mischief and the seed of Zeus,"
1843,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Brought equal at the last? Nay, is the beast"
1844,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Sun's master, Helios? Shepherds are my subjects."
1845,APOLLO IN PHERAE,I do not sway high kingdoms of the air—
1846,APOLLO IN PHERAE,I drag my hoofs in the clay. I do not fashion
1847,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Songs for the stars upon a golden lyre—
1848,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"I (as did Marsyas, ha?) scrape out rough tunes"
1849,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"On common reeds. I am not beautiful,"
1850,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"I have not eyes like June-blue heavens on fire,"
1851,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Nor hair filched from the harvest of the sun,"
1852,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Nor a white matchless shape, supple and swift"
1853,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"And strong and splendid. I am an earthy thing,"
1854,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Half goat and half coarse boor, not fit to touch"
1855,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"The sun's moon-sister—(yet, who knows? who knows!"
1856,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Let her keep watch on Latmos how she will
1857,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Above the slumbers of her pretty shepherd!)
1858,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"No, Pan is not as Helios! Helios is"
1859,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"A shepherd, sister'd by a shepherd's wanton,"
1860,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"And Pan's a King, and shepherds are his subjects!"""
1861,APOLLO IN PHERAE,
1862,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Zeus, did it feed thy pride on proud Olympos,"
1863,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Did it pleasure thee to hear the brutish God,"
1864,APOLLO IN PHERAE,The disgustful animal we chafe to name
1865,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"A God even as ourselves, thus flout thy son?"
1866,APOLLO IN PHERAE,
1867,APOLLO IN PHERAE,_Asklepios! dead son! Asklepios!_
1868,APOLLO IN PHERAE,
1869,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Doomed to the solitariness of greatness
1870,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"We watch, we lonely Gods on shrouded heights,"
1871,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"The careful, padded steps, the little lives,"
1872,APOLLO IN PHERAE,The little trivial lives of men and women
1873,APOLLO IN PHERAE,That fear our anger and entreat our favour;
1874,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"And while we are indifferent all is well,"
1875,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"And if we rise to hate all is not ill,"
1876,APOLLO IN PHERAE,But when we stoop to meet uplifted eyes
1877,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Of bright aspiring fools that will not choose
1878,APOLLO IN PHERAE,To tread life's inconspicuous middle ways—
1879,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"O, when we love we bring our lov'd ones woe"
1880,APOLLO IN PHERAE,
1881,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"I had a son, his name was Phaeton."
1882,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Could he be of my being and not be proud?
1883,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"He was all inspiration, and he mounted"
1884,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Up to the highest and reached his hands for the sun
1885,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"And shouted: ""I will light the fires in heaven!"""
1886,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"But he was three-parts man to one-part God,"
1887,APOLLO IN PHERAE,So men and Gods shrugged his brief blaze of glory
1888,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Into extinction ... Thus I lost my son,"
1889,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Phaeton, killed thro' overmuch ambition."
1890,APOLLO IN PHERAE,
1891,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"I had a son, his name was Orpheus."
1892,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Could he be of my being and not love?
1893,APOLLO IN PHERAE,His love was rooted deeplier than Hell.
1894,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"He said: ""I will pluck back my love from Hell"
1895,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Tho' it upheave all Hell in the plucking."" When"
1896,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"He failed, being one-part man to three-parts God,"
1897,APOLLO IN PHERAE,He chose the swift way to regain his love
1898,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"And died a vile death ... Thus I lost my son,"
1899,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Orpheus, killed thro' too great love and longing."
1900,APOLLO IN PHERAE,
1901,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"I had a son. He was Asklepios,"
1902,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Could he be of my being and not KNOW?
1903,APOLLO IN PHERAE,His wisdom girdled life and death in one;
1904,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Life smiled on him, because he smiled on death"
1905,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"And said: ""Life is less conquerable than death."""
1906,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"He said: ""I will reverse the word of death."""
1907,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"He said: ""I will make the dead to live again."""
1908,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Two days ago Asklepios lived ...
1909,APOLLO IN PHERAE,The King
1910,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Of the nether-world, that wears the face of night"
1911,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"And hates me, wearing day's face, called on Zeus:"
1912,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"""This mortal steals upon my sovereignty,"
1913,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Stands brazen champion for the world of flesh,"
1914,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Determines souls that waver towards the Styx—
1915,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Worse! hales the souls back from beyond the Styx,"
1916,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Bringing the dead to life. This is more craft,"
1917,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Brother, than we may suffer in a man."
1918,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Shall he with careless finger sway at will
1919,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"The Balance of Destiny? Avenge me, Zeus!"""
1920,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"A Cyclops forged a thunder-bolt for Zeus,"
1921,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"And, black-browed, Zeus did launch it ... Thus I lost"
1922,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"My son Asklepios, killed thro' too much knowledge."
1923,APOLLO IN PHERAE,
1924,APOLLO IN PHERAE,_Asklepios! my dead Asklepios!_
1925,APOLLO IN PHERAE,
1926,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Let the dark King of Stygia howl for aid
1927,APOLLO IN PHERAE,To Olympos! I am King of Heaven and ask
1928,APOLLO IN PHERAE,No aid! I wreak my vengeance for myself.
1929,APOLLO IN PHERAE,I rose up in the wrath of my bereavement
1930,APOLLO IN PHERAE,And set an arrow to the silver bow
1931,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"That none save I can bend, and let it fly."
1932,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"I might not slay the wielder of the bolt,"
1933,APOLLO IN PHERAE,But I did slay the forger of the bolt.
1934,APOLLO IN PHERAE,And when I saw the Cyclops pierced and dead
1935,APOLLO IN PHERAE,I came to Zeus and told him of my deed:
1936,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"""Father, 'gainst whom my bow was never turned,"
1937,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Father, that hast destroyed thine own son's son,"
1938,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"I defy thy doing and have destroyed thy tool."""
1939,APOLLO IN PHERAE,
1940,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Then while the Gods stood all aghast, Zeus spake:"
1941,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"""Go from among this immortal company"
1942,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Which thou hast sinned against in daring so
1943,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"To sin against _me_ that am the head of all,"
1944,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"And learn to quell thy too fierce spirit, learn"
1945,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"To teach thy riotous blood obedience,"
1946,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Serving the sons of men one year of days.
1947,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Go hence! thou art not of us for twelve moons."""
1948,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"I nothing said, and went. For when we Gods"
1949,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Revolt among ourselves the end is near,"
1950,APOLLO IN PHERAE,And Zeus must levy justice as he will.
1951,APOLLO IN PHERAE,
1952,APOLLO IN PHERAE,_Asklepios! my dead Asklepios!
1953,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Had an hundred bolts been forged instead of one
1954,APOLLO IN PHERAE,I had slain an hundred Cyclops for thy sake
1955,APOLLO IN PHERAE,And suffered an hundred years of degradation!_
1956,APOLLO IN PHERAE,
1957,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Earth that receivest my body for a space,"
1958,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"I first saw light upon thee. Comfort me,"
1959,APOLLO IN PHERAE,And tame a little the untamed blood in me.
1960,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Better will I endure to learn of thee
1961,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Than of the envious Gods, whom this disgrace"
1962,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Serves for a secret feast to glut their hearts on.
1963,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"For we have loved each other, thou and I,"
1964,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"And I have belted thee with golden arms,"
1965,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"And I have claspt thee daily with hot kisses,"
1966,APOLLO IN PHERAE,And felt thee leap and pulse and answer to me
1967,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Like a shy maid grown bold and glad with love.
1968,APOLLO IN PHERAE,There's that in the core of thee that is so kin
1969,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"To the core of me, it holds us twain inseverable,"
1970,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Tho' from a billion blue-gold caverns of air
1971,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Translucent waves of space roll up an ocean
1972,APOLLO IN PHERAE,'Twixt earth and sun: our hearts beat time together.
1973,APOLLO IN PHERAE,My sister of the spheres has no such power
1974,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"To quicken thee, be lov'd of thee and love thee."
1975,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"She rains down light like argent snows; and thou,"
1976,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Part shadow'd, part-illumin'd, wholly chill'd,"
1977,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Submitt'st thyself to call her queen, who asks"
1978,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"No ardent service of thee, earth, as I do."
1979,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Yet, chaste twin-sister, we were of one birth;"
1980,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Thy veins run all the silver, mine the gold."
1981,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"What marvel Leto had nine days labour of us,"
1982,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Strenuously thus disparting snow from flame,"
1983,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"To give the Gods one daughter all pure ice,"
1984,APOLLO IN PHERAE,One son all perfect fire?...
1985,APOLLO IN PHERAE,O Thunderer!
1986,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"That spark of immortal fire which, pregnant in her,"
1987,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Evolved into my Godhead, issuèd"
1988,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Out of _thy_ Godhead; my humiliation
1989,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Is thy humiliation, Zeus! I stand"
1990,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Supremest in thy shining progeny:
1991,APOLLO IN PHERAE,I am thy glittering symbol fix'd in heaven
1992,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"To draw the dazed, adoring eyes of men:"
1993,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"I am thy arm of vengeance, I the hand"
1994,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Bestowing thy good gifts: I am thy Voice
1995,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Of mystic prophecy and divination
1996,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Thro' which thou keep'st thy fingers on men's souls.
1997,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Daughters and sons thou hast whose attributes,"
1998,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"This one by twisty cunning, this by love"
1999,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Too often base, this by remorseless carnage"
2000,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Not bearing the high name of vengeance, these"
2001,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"By the insidious lusts of gold and wine,"
2002,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Serve to express thee to the bodies of men;
2003,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"But I express thee to the ghost in them,"
2004,APOLLO IN PHERAE,For there is none whose vesture is like mine
2005,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Weft only of the spirit's highest tissues,"
2006,APOLLO IN PHERAE,So that the world beholding thee thro' me
2007,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Beholds thee at thy zenith, and exalted"
2008,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Out of the flesh struggles to sense an instant
2009,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"The music, fire and essence of Olympos."
2010,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"This Thunderer, wilt thou smirch? More dim, more dim"
2011,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Than the imperial spark thou quenchest in me
2012,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Thou mak'st thy imperial fires whence I did spring,"
2013,APOLLO IN PHERAE,The fount of us so indissoluble
2014,APOLLO IN PHERAE,That what shames thee shames me.
2015,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Earth, is this vengeance?"
2016,APOLLO IN PHERAE,
2017,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Nay, I see clearer. Rest unstained of me,"
2018,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Thou God that art the father of my being.
2019,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"The spirit of me, which is _Thou_, makes cause with thee"
2020,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Against me. We must be inviolable
2021,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Or men will point their fingers—when We fall.
2022,APOLLO IN PHERAE,
2023,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"_Asklepios! farewell, Asklepios!_"
2024,APOLLO IN PHERAE,
2025,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Earth, I will serve on thee my year of days"
2026,APOLLO IN PHERAE,Nor chafe beneath them like a petulant boy.
2027,APOLLO IN PHERAE,"Ay, tho' Zeus force my Godhead into bonds"
2028,APOLLO IN PHERAE,I will yet bear my bondage like a God.
