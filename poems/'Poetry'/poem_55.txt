IV

Be ye lift up, ye deathless doors;
  Let wave your banners o'er Him!
Exult, ye streets; be strewn, ye floors,
  With palm, with bay, before Him!
       With transport fetch Him in,
       Ye ransom'd folk from sin--
       Your Lord, return'd to bless!
       O kneeling king, confess--
         O subject men, adore Him!
