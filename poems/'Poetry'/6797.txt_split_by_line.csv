60,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
61,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"I chanced the other eve,--"
62,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"But how I ne'er will tell,--"
63,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,The paper to receive.
64,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,That's published down in hell.
65,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
66,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"In general one may guess,"
67,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,I little care to see
68,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,This free-corps of the press
69,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,Got up so easily;
70,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
71,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,But suddenly my eyes
72,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"A side-note chanced to meet,"
73,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,And fancy my surprise
74,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,At reading in the sheet:--
75,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
76,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""For twenty weary springs"""
77,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"(The post from Erebus,"
78,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"Remark me, always brings"
79,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,Unpleasant news to us)--
80,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
81,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""Through want of water, we"
82,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,Have well-nigh lost our breath;
83,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,In great perplexity
84,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,Hell came and asked for Death;
85,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
86,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""'They can wade through the Styx,"
87,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,Catch crabs in Lethe's flood;
88,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"Old Charon's in a fix,"
89,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"His boat lies in the mud,"
90,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
91,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""'The dead leap over there,"
92,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,The young and old as well;
93,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"The boatman gets no fare,"
94,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,And loudly curses hell.'
95,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
96,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""King Minos bade his spies"
97,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,In all directions go;
98,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"The devils needs must rise,"
99,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,And bring him news below.
100,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
101,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""Hurrah! The secret's told"
102,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,They've caught the robber's nest;
103,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,A merry feast let's hold!
104,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"Come, hell, and join the rest!"
105,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
106,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""An author's countless band,"
107,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"Stalked round Cocytus' brink,"
108,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,Each bearing in his hand
109,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,A glass for holding ink.
110,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
111,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""And into casks they drew"
112,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"The water, strange to say,"
113,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,As boys suck sweet wine through
114,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,An elder-reed in play.
115,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
116,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""Quick! o'er them cast the net,"
117,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,Ere they have time to flee!
118,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"Warm welcome ye will get,"
119,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,So come to Sans-souci!
120,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
121,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""Smelt by the king ere long,"
122,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"He sharpened up his tooth,"
123,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,And thus addressed the throng
124,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"(Full angrily, in truth):"
125,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
126,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""'The robbers is't we see?"
127,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"What trade? What land, perchance?'--"
128,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,'German news-writers we!'--
129,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,Enough to make us dance!
130,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
131,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""'A wish I long have known"
132,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"To bid ye stop and dine,"
133,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"Ere ye by Death were mown,"
134,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,That brother-in-law of mine.
135,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
136,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""'Yet now by Styx I swear,"
137,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"Whose flood ye would imbibe,"
138,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,That torments and despair
139,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,Shall fill your vermin-tribe!
140,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
141,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""'The pitcher seeks the well,"
142,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,Till broken 'tis one day;
143,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"They who for ink would smell,"
144,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,The penalty must pay.
145,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
146,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""'So seize them by their thumbs,"
147,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,And loosen straight my beast
148,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"E'en now he licks his gums,"
149,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,Impatient for the feast.'--
150,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
151,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""How quivered every limb"
152,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,Beneath the bull-dog's jaws
153,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"Their honors baited him,"
154,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,And he allowed no pause.
155,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
156,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""Convulsively they swear,"
157,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"Still writhe the rabble rout,"
158,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,Engaged with anxious care
159,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"In pumping Lethe out."""
160,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
161,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"Ye Christians, good and meek,"
162,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,This vision bear in mind;
163,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"If journalists ye seek,"
164,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,Attempt their thumbs to find.
165,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
166,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"Defects they often hide,"
167,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,As folks whose hairs are gone
168,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,We see with wigs supplied
169,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,Probatum! I have done!
170,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,
171,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,

2095,MARY.,
2096,MARY.,"Yet I who have achieved this work of pride,"
2097,MARY.,I cannot share the rapture felt by all:
2098,MARY.,"My heart is changed, my heart is turned aside,"
2099,MARY.,It shuns the splendor of this festival;
2100,MARY.,"'Tis in the British camp it seeks to hide,--"
2101,MARY.,'Tis on the foe my yearning glances fall;
2102,MARY.,"And from the joyous circle I must steal,"

2104,MARY.,
2105,MARY.,Who? I? What! in my bosom chaste
2106,MARY.,Can mortal's image have a seat?
2107,MARY.,"This heart, by heavenly glory graced,--"

2111,MARY.,Own for my country's foe a flame--
2112,MARY.,"To the chaste sun my guilt proclaim,"
2113,MARY.,And not be crushed beneath my shame?

2115,MARY.,"(The music behind the scene changes into a soft, melting melody.)"
2116,MARY.,
2117,MARY.,Woe! oh woe! what strains enthralling!
2118,MARY.,How bewildering to mine ear
2119,MARY.,"Each his voice beloved recalling,"
2120,MARY.,Charming up his image dear!

2124,MARY.,In the hotly-raging strife!
2125,MARY.,Could my courage find fresh life!
2126,MARY.,
2127,MARY.,"How those tones, those voices blest"
2128,MARY.,Coil around my bosom burning
2129,MARY.,All the strength within my breast
2130,MARY.,"Melting into tender yearning,"
2131,MARY.,Into tears of sadness turning!
2132,MARY.,
2133,MARY.,(The flutes are again heard--she falls into a silent melancholy.)
2134,MARY.,
2135,MARY.,Gentle crook! oh that I never
2136,MARY.,For the sword had bartered thee!

2141,MARY.,"Take--all claim I must surrender,--"
2142,MARY.,"Take, oh take away thy crown!"
2143,MARY.,
2144,MARY.,"Ah, I open saw yon heaven,"
2145,MARY.,Saw the features of the blest!
2146,MARY.,"Yet to earth my hopes are riven,"
2147,MARY.,In the skies they ne'er can rest!
2148,MARY.,Wherefore make me ply with ardor
2149,MARY.,"This vocation, terror-fraught?"
2150,MARY.,Would this heart were rendered harder.
2151,MARY.,That by heaven to feel was taught!
