638,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,Amidst the chattering jackdaws' play:
639,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,_And we return no more_.
640,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,But underneath the streets are still;
641,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,"Noon, and the market's o'er!"
642,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,Back go the goodwives o'er the hill;
643,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,_For we return no more_.
644,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,What merchant to our gates shall come?
645,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,What wise man bring us lore?
646,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,"What abbot ride away to Rome,"
647,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,_Now we return no more?_
648,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,What mayor shall rule the hall we built?
649,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,Whose scarlet sweep the floor?
650,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,"What judge shall doom the robber's guilt,"
651,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,_Now we return no more?_
652,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,New houses in the street shall rise
653,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,"Where builded we before,"
654,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,Of other stone wrought otherwise;
655,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,_For we return no more_.
656,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,And crops shall cover field and hill
657,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,"Unlike what once they bore,"
658,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,"And all be done without our will,"
659,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,_Now we return no more_.
660,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,"Look up! the arrows streak the sky,"
661,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,The horns of battle roar;
662,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,"The long spears lower and draw nigh,"
663,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,_And we return no more_.
664,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,"Remember how beside the wain,"
665,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,"We spoke the word of war,"
666,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,"And sowed this harvest of the plain,"
667,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,_And we return no more_.
668,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,Lay spears about the Ruddy Fox!
669,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,The days of old are o'er;
670,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,Heave sword about the Running Ox!
671,THE BURGHERS' BATTLE,_For we return no more._

738,ERROR AND LOSS,"Still autumn was it, and the meadows slept,"
739,ERROR AND LOSS,"The misty hills dreamed, and the silent wood"
740,ERROR AND LOSS,Seemed listening to the sorrow of my mood:

744,ERROR AND LOSS,"Then 'twixt my tears a maiden did I see,"

747,ERROR AND LOSS,"With grief-worn eyes, until my woe did pass"
748,ERROR AND LOSS,"From me to her, and tearless now I was,"

752,ERROR AND LOSS,"I knew not of him, and she turned away"

780,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,THE HALL AND THE WOOD
781,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
782,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
783,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,'Twas in the water-dwindling tide
784,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"When July days were done,"
785,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Sir Rafe of Greenhowes 'gan to ride
786,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,In the earliest of the sun.
787,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
788,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"He left the white-walled burg behind,"
789,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,He rode amidst the wheat.
790,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,The westland-gotten wind blew kind
791,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Across the acres sweet.
792,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
793,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"Then rose his heart and cleared his brow,"
794,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,And slow he rode the way:
795,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"""As then it was, so is it now,"
796,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"Not all hath worn away."""
797,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
798,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,So came he to the long green lane
799,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"That leadeth to the ford,"
800,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,And saw the sickle by the wain
801,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Shine bright as any sword.
802,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
803,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"The brown carles stayed 'twixt draught and draught,"
804,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And murmuring, stood aloof,"
805,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,But one spake out when he had laughed:
806,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"""God bless the Green-wood Roof!"""
807,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
808,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Then o'er the ford and up he fared:
809,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,And lo the happy hills!
810,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And the mountain-dale by summer cleared,"
811,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,That oft the winter fills.
812,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
813,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"Then forth he rode by Peter's gate,"
814,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,And smiled and said aloud:
815,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"""No more a day doth the Prior wait;"
816,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"White stands the tower and proud."""
817,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
818,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,There leaned a knight on the gateway side
819,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"In armour white and wan,"
820,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And after the heels of the horse he cried,"
821,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"""God keep the hunted man!"""
822,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
823,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"Then quoth Sir Rafe, ""Amen, amen!"""
824,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,For he deemed the word was good;
825,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,But never a while he lingered then
826,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Till he reached the Nether Wood.
827,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
828,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
829,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
830,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"He rode by ash, he rode by oak,"
831,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"He rode the thicket round,"
832,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And heard no woodman strike a stroke,"
833,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,No wandering wife he found.
834,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
835,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"He rode the wet, he rode the dry,"
836,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,He rode the grassy glade:
837,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"At Wood-end yet the sun was high,"
838,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,And his heart was unafraid.
839,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
840,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"There on the bent his rein he drew,"
841,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And looked o'er field and fold,"
842,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,O'er all the merry meads he knew
843,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Beneath the mountains old.
844,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
845,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,He gazed across to the good Green Howe
846,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,As he smelt the sun-warmed sward;
847,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"Then his face grew pale from chin to brow,"
848,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And he cried, ""God save the sword!"""
849,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
850,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"For there beyond the winding way,"
851,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"Above the orchards green,"
852,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Stood up the ancient gables grey
853,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,With ne'er a roof between.
854,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
855,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"His naked blade in hand he had,"
856,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"O'er rough and smooth he rode,"
857,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Till he stood where once his heart was glad
858,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Amidst his old abode.
859,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
860,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
861,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
862,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Across the hearth a tie-beam lay
863,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Unmoved a weary while.
864,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,The flame that clomb the ashlar grey
865,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Had burned it red as tile.
866,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
867,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,The sparrows bickering on the floor
868,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Fled at his entering in;
869,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,The swift flew past the empty door
870,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,His winged meat to win.
871,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
872,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Red apples from the tall old tree
873,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,O'er the wall's rent were shed.
874,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"Thence oft, a little lad, would he"
875,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Look down upon the lead.
876,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
877,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,There turned the cheeping chaffinch now
878,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,And feared no birding child;
879,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Through the shot-window thrust a bough
880,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Of garden-rose run wild.
881,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
882,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"He looked to right, he looked to left,"
883,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And down to the cold grey hearth,"
884,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Where lay an axe with half burned heft
885,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Amidst the ashen dearth.
886,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
887,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,He caught it up and cast it wide
888,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Against the gable wall;
889,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"Then to the daïs did he stride,"
890,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,O'er beam and bench and all.
891,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
892,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"Amidst there yet the high-seat stood,"
893,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Where erst his sires had sat;
894,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And the mighty board of oaken wood,"
895,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,The fire had stayed thereat.
896,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
897,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Then through the red wrath of his eyne
898,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"He saw a sheathed sword,"
899,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"Laid thwart that wasted field of wine,"
900,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Amidmost of the board.
901,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
902,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And by the hilts a slug-horn lay,"
903,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And therebeside a scroll,"
904,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,He caught it up and turned away
905,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,From the lea-land of the bowl.
906,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
907,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"Then with the sobbing grief he strove,"
908,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,For he saw his name thereon;
909,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,And the heart within his breast uphove
910,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"As the pen's tale now he won,"
911,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
912,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"""O Rafe, my love of long ago!"
913,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"Draw forth thy father's blade,"
914,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And blow the horn for friend and foe,"
915,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And the good green-wood to aid!"""
916,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
917,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"He turned and took the slug-horn up,"
918,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And set it to his mouth,"
919,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,And o'er that meadow of the cup
920,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Blew east and west and south.
921,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
922,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,He drew the sword from out the sheath
923,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,And shook the fallow brand;
924,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And there a while with bated breath,"
925,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,And hearkening ear did stand.
926,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
927,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Him-seemed the horn's voice he might hear--
928,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Or the wind that blew o'er all.
929,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Him-seemed that footsteps drew anear--
930,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Or the boughs shook round the hall.
931,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
932,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Him-seemed he heard a voice he knew--
933,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Or a dream of while agone.
934,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Him-seemed bright raiment towards him drew--
935,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Or bright the sun-set shone.
936,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
937,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"She stood before him face to face,"
938,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"With the sun-beam thwart her hand,"
939,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,As on the gold of the Holy Place
940,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,The painted angels stand.
941,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
942,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,With many a kiss she closed his eyes;
943,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,She kissed him cheek and chin:
944,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,E'en so in the painted Paradise
945,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Are Earth's folk welcomed in.
946,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
947,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"There in the door the green-coats stood,"
948,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"O'er the bows went up the cry,"
949,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"""O welcome, Rafe, to the free green-wood,"
950,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"With us to live and die."""
951,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
952,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"It was bill and bow by the high-seat stood,"
953,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And they cried above the bows,"
954,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"""Now welcome, Rafe, to the good green-wood,"
955,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And welcome Kate the Rose!"""
956,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
957,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"White, white in the moon is the woodland plash,"
958,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"White is the woodland glade,"
959,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"Forth wend those twain, from oak to ash,"
960,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,With light hearts unafraid.
961,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
962,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"The summer moon high o'er the hill,"
963,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"All silver-white is she,"
964,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And Sir Rafe's good men with bow and bill,"
965,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,They go by two and three.
966,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
967,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"In the fair green-wood where lurks no fear,"
968,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"Where the King's writ runneth not,"
969,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"There dwell they, friends and fellows dear,"
970,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,While summer days are hot.
971,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
972,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And when the leaf from the oak-tree falls,"
973,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And winds blow rough and strong,"
974,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,With the carles of the woodland thorps and halls
975,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"They dwell, and fear no wrong."
976,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
977,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And there the merry yule they make,"
978,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And see the winter wane,"
979,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And fain are they for true-love's sake,"
980,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,And the folk thereby are fain.
981,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
982,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,For the ploughing carle and the straying herd
983,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Flee never for Sir Rafe:
984,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"No barefoot maiden wends afeard,"
985,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,And she deems the thicket safe.
986,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
987,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,But sore adread do the chapmen ride;
988,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Wide round the wood they go;
989,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And the judge and the sergeants wander wide,"
990,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,Lest they plead before the bow.
991,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,
992,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"Well learned and wise is Sir Rafe's good sword,"
993,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And straight the arrows fly,"
994,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,"And they find the coat of many a lord,"
995,THE HALL AND THE WOOD,And the crest that rideth high.

2562,MOTHER AND SON,The hair that thy small hand clutcheth

2564,MOTHER AND SON,"I am true, but my face is a snare;"
2565,MOTHER AND SON,"soft and deep are my eyes,"

2587,MOTHER AND SON,From dusk unto dusk of the summer
2588,MOTHER AND SON,three times in a week would I pass
2589,MOTHER AND SON,To the downs from the house on the river

2601,MOTHER AND SON,
2602,MOTHER AND SON,"Yet, yet the tears on my cheek!"
2603,MOTHER AND SON,and what is this doth move
2604,MOTHER AND SON,"My heart to thy heart, beloved,"
2605,MOTHER AND SON,save the flood of yearning love?
2606,MOTHER AND SON,"For fair and fierce is thy father,"
2607,MOTHER AND SON,and soft and strange are his eyes
2608,MOTHER AND SON,That look on the days that shall be
2609,MOTHER AND SON,with the hope of the brave and the wise.
2610,MOTHER AND SON,"It was many a day that we laughed,"
2611,MOTHER AND SON,"as over the meadows we walked,"
2612,MOTHER AND SON,And many a day I hearkened
2613,MOTHER AND SON,and the pictures came as he talked;
2614,MOTHER AND SON,"It was many a day that we longed,"
2615,MOTHER AND SON,and we lingered late at eve
2616,MOTHER AND SON,"Ere speech from speech was sundered,"
2617,MOTHER AND SON,and my hand his hand could leave.
2618,MOTHER AND SON,"Then I wept when I was alone,"
2619,MOTHER AND SON,and I longed till the daylight came;
2620,MOTHER AND SON,"And down the stairs I stole,"
2621,MOTHER AND SON,and there was our housekeeping dame
2622,MOTHER AND SON,"(No mother of me, the foundling)"
2623,MOTHER AND SON,kindling the fire betimes
2624,MOTHER AND SON,Ere the haymaking folk went forth
2625,MOTHER AND SON,to the meadows down by the limes;
2626,MOTHER AND SON,All things I saw at a glance;
2627,MOTHER AND SON,the quickening fire-tongues leapt
2628,MOTHER AND SON,"Through the crackling heap of sticks,"
2629,MOTHER AND SON,"and the sweet smoke up from it crept,"
2630,MOTHER AND SON,And close to the very hearth
2631,MOTHER AND SON,"the low sun flooded the floor,"
2632,MOTHER AND SON,And the cat and her kittens played
2633,MOTHER AND SON,in the sun by the open door.
2634,MOTHER AND SON,"The garden was fair in the morning,"
2635,MOTHER AND SON,and there in the road he stood
2636,MOTHER AND SON,Beyond the crimson daisies
2637,MOTHER AND SON,and the bush of southernwood.
2638,MOTHER AND SON,Then side by side together
2639,MOTHER AND SON,"through the grey-walled place we went,"
2640,MOTHER AND SON,"And O the fear departed,"
2641,MOTHER AND SON,and the rest and sweet content!
2642,MOTHER AND SON,
2643,MOTHER AND SON,"Son, sorrow and wisdom he taught me,"
2644,MOTHER AND SON,and sore I grieved and learned
2645,MOTHER AND SON,As we twain grew into one;
2646,MOTHER AND SON,and the heart within me burned
2647,MOTHER AND SON,With the very hopes of his heart.
2648,MOTHER AND SON,"Ah, son, it is piteous,"
2649,MOTHER AND SON,But never again in my life
2650,MOTHER AND SON,shall I dare to speak to thee thus;
2651,MOTHER AND SON,So may these lonely words
2652,MOTHER AND SON,"about thee creep and cling,"
2653,MOTHER AND SON,These words of the lonely night
2654,MOTHER AND SON,in the days of our wayfaring.
2655,MOTHER AND SON,Many a child of woman
2656,MOTHER AND SON,"to-night is born in the town,"
2657,MOTHER AND SON,The desert of folly and wrong;
2658,MOTHER AND SON,and of what and whence are they grown?
2659,MOTHER AND SON,Many and many an one
2660,MOTHER AND SON,of wont and use is born;
2661,MOTHER AND SON,For a husband is taken to bed
2662,MOTHER AND SON,as a hat or a ribbon is worn.
2663,MOTHER AND SON,Prudence begets her thousands;
2664,MOTHER AND SON,"""good is a housekeeper's life,"
2665,MOTHER AND SON,So shall I sell my body
2666,MOTHER AND SON,"that I may be matron and wife."""
2667,MOTHER AND SON,"""And I shall endure foul wedlock"
2668,MOTHER AND SON,"and bear the children of need."""
2669,MOTHER AND SON,"Some are there born of hate,"
2670,MOTHER AND SON,many the children of greed.
2671,MOTHER AND SON,"""I, I too can be wedded,"
2672,MOTHER AND SON,"though thou my love hast got."""
2673,MOTHER AND SON,"""I am fair and hard of heart,"
2674,MOTHER AND SON,"and riches shall be my lot."""
2675,MOTHER AND SON,"And all these are the good and the happy,"
2676,MOTHER AND SON,on whom the world dawns fair.
2677,MOTHER AND SON,"O son, when wilt thou learn"
2678,MOTHER AND SON,"of those that are born of despair,"
2679,MOTHER AND SON,As the fabled mud of the Nile
2680,MOTHER AND SON,that quickens under the sun
2681,MOTHER AND SON,"With a growth of creeping things,"
2682,MOTHER AND SON,half dead when just begun?
2683,MOTHER AND SON,E'en such is the care of Nature
2684,MOTHER AND SON,"that man should never die,"
2685,MOTHER AND SON,"Though she breed of the fools of the earth,"
2686,MOTHER AND SON,and the dregs of the city sty.
2687,MOTHER AND SON,
2688,MOTHER AND SON,"But thou, O son, O son,"
2689,MOTHER AND SON,"of very love wert born,"
2690,MOTHER AND SON,"When our hope fulfilled bred hope,"
2691,MOTHER AND SON,and fear was a folly outworn.
2692,MOTHER AND SON,On the eve of the toil and the battle
2693,MOTHER AND SON,"all sorrow and grief we weighed,"
2694,MOTHER AND SON,"We hoped and we were not ashamed,"
2695,MOTHER AND SON,we knew and we were not afraid.
2696,MOTHER AND SON,
2697,MOTHER AND SON,Now waneth the night and the moon;
2698,MOTHER AND SON,"ah, son, it is piteous"
2699,MOTHER AND SON,That never again in my life
2700,MOTHER AND SON,shall I dare to speak to thee thus.
2701,MOTHER AND SON,But sure from the wise and the simple
2702,MOTHER AND SON,shall the mighty come to birth;
2703,MOTHER AND SON,"And fair were my fate, beloved,"
2704,MOTHER AND SON,if I be yet on the earth
2705,MOTHER AND SON,"When the world is awaken at last,"
2706,MOTHER AND SON,and from mouth to mouth they tell
2707,MOTHER AND SON,"Of thy love and thy deeds and thy valour,"
2708,MOTHER AND SON,and thy hope that nought can quell.

2714,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN
2715,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,
2716,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,
2717,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,When the boughs of the garden hang heavy with rain
2718,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"And the blackbird reneweth his song,"
2719,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"And the thunder departing yet rolleth again,"
2720,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,I remember the ending of wrong.
2721,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,
2722,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,When the day that was dusk while his death was aloof
2723,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,Is ending wide-gleaming and strange
2724,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"For the clearness of all things beneath the world's roof,"
2725,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,I call back the wild chance and the change.
2726,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,
2727,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,For once we twain sat through the hot afternoon
2728,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"While the rain held aloof for a while,"
2729,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"Till she, the soft-clad, for the glory of June"
2730,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,Changed all with the change of her smile.
2731,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,
2732,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"For her smile was of longing, no longer of glee,"
2733,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"And her fingers, entwined with mine own,"
2734,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,With caresses unquiet sought kindness of me
2735,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,For the gift that I never had known.
2736,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,
2737,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"Then down rushed the rain, and the voice of the thunder"
2738,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"Smote dumb all the sound of the street,"
2739,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"And I to myself was grown nought but a wonder,"
2740,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,As she leaned down my kisses to meet.
2741,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,
2742,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"That she craved for my lips that had craved her so often,"
2743,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"And the hand that had trembled to touch,"
2744,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,That the tears filled her eyes I had hoped not to soften
2745,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,In this world was a marvel too much.
2746,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,
2747,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"It was dusk 'mid the thunder, dusk e'en as the night,"
2748,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"When first brake out our love like the storm,"
2749,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"But no night-hour was it, and back came the light"
2750,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,While our hands with each other were warm.
2751,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,
2752,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"And her smile killed with kisses, came back as at first"
2753,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"As she rose up and led me along,"
2754,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"And out to the garden, where nought was athirst,"
2755,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,And the blackbird renewing his song.
2756,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,
2757,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"Earth's fragrance went with her, as in the wet grass,"
2758,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,Her feet little hidden were set;
2759,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"She bent down her head, 'neath the roses to pass,"
2760,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,And her arm with the lily was wet.
2761,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,
2762,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,In the garden we wandered while day waned apace
2763,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,And the thunder was dying aloof;
2764,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"Till the moon o'er the minster-wall lifted his face,"
2765,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,And grey gleamed out the lead of the roof.
2766,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,
2767,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"Then we turned from the blossoms, and cold were they grown:"
2768,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,In the trees the wind westering moved;
2769,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,"Till over the threshold back fluttered her gown,"
2770,THUNDER IN THE GARDEN,And in the dark house was I loved.

2781,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"On poor folk trod he like the dirt,"
2782,THE GOD OF THE POOR,None but God might do him hurt.
2783,THE GOD OF THE POOR,_Deus est Deus pauperum._
2784,THE GOD OF THE POOR,
2785,THE GOD OF THE POOR,With a grace of prayers sung loud and late
2786,THE GOD OF THE POOR,Many a widow's house he ate;
2787,THE GOD OF THE POOR,Many a poor knight at his hands
2788,THE GOD OF THE POOR,Lost his house and narrow lands.
2789,THE GOD OF THE POOR,_Deus est Deus pauperum._
2790,THE GOD OF THE POOR,
2791,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"He burnt the harvests many a time,"
2792,THE GOD OF THE POOR,He made fair houses heaps of lime;
2793,THE GOD OF THE POOR,Whatso man loved wife or maid
2794,THE GOD OF THE POOR,Of Evil-head was sore afraid.
2795,THE GOD OF THE POOR,_Deus est Deus pauperum._
2796,THE GOD OF THE POOR,
2797,THE GOD OF THE POOR,He slew good men and spared the bad;
2798,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"Too long a day the foul dog had,"
2799,THE GOD OF THE POOR,E'en as all dogs will have their day;
2800,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"But God is as strong as man, I say."
2801,THE GOD OF THE POOR,_Deus est Deus pauperum._
2802,THE GOD OF THE POOR,
2803,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"For a valiant knight, men called Boncoeur,"
2804,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"Had hope he should not long endure,"
2805,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"And gathered to him much good folk,"
2806,THE GOD OF THE POOR,Hardy hearts to break the yoke.
2807,THE GOD OF THE POOR,_Deus est Deus pauperum._
2808,THE GOD OF THE POOR,
2809,THE GOD OF THE POOR,But Boncoeur deemed it would be vain
2810,THE GOD OF THE POOR,To strive his guarded house to gain;
2811,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"Therefore, within a little while,"
2812,THE GOD OF THE POOR,He set himself to work by guile.
2813,THE GOD OF THE POOR,_Deus est Deus pauperum._
2814,THE GOD OF THE POOR,
2815,THE GOD OF THE POOR,He knew that Maltete loved right well
2816,THE GOD OF THE POOR,Red gold and heavy. If from hell
2817,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"The Devil had cried, ""Take this gold cup,"""
2818,THE GOD OF THE POOR,Down had he gone to fetch it up.

2820,THE GOD OF THE POOR,
2821,THE GOD OF THE POOR,Twenty poor men's lives were nought
2822,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"To him, beside a ring well wrought."
2823,THE GOD OF THE POOR,The pommel of his hunting-knife
2824,THE GOD OF THE POOR,Was worth ten times a poor man's life.
2825,THE GOD OF THE POOR,_Deus est Deus pauperum._
2826,THE GOD OF THE POOR,
2827,THE GOD OF THE POOR,A squire new-come from over-sea
2828,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"Boncoeur called to him privily,"
2829,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"And when he knew his lord's intent,"
2830,THE GOD OF THE POOR,Clad like a churl therefrom he went
2831,THE GOD OF THE POOR,_Deus est Deus pauperum._
2832,THE GOD OF THE POOR,
2833,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"But when he came where dwelt Maltete,"
2834,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"With few words did he pass the gate,"
2835,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"For Maltete built him walls anew,"
2836,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"And, wageless, folk from field he drew."
2837,THE GOD OF THE POOR,_Deus est Deus pauperum._
2838,THE GOD OF THE POOR,
2839,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"Now passed the squire through this and that,"
2840,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"Till he came to where Sir Maltete sat,"
2841,THE GOD OF THE POOR,And over red wine wagged his beard:

2925,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"Until they left the beaten way,"
2926,THE GOD OF THE POOR,And dusk it grew at end of day.
2927,THE GOD OF THE POOR,_Deus est Deus pauperum._
2928,THE GOD OF THE POOR,
2929,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"There, in a clearing of the wood,"

2945,THE GOD OF THE POOR,_Deus est Deus pauperum._
2946,THE GOD OF THE POOR,
2947,THE GOD OF THE POOR,"So when he saw how Maltete came,"

3299,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3300,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3301,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,It was up in the morn we rose betimes
3302,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,From the hall-floor hard by the row of limes.
3303,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3304,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"It was but John the Red and I,"
3305,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And we were the brethren of Gregory;
3306,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3307,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And Gregory the Wright was one
3308,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"Of the valiant men beneath the sun,"
3309,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3310,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And what he bade us that we did
3311,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,For ne'er he kept his counsel hid.
3312,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3313,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"So out we went, and the clattering latch"
3314,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Woke up the swallows under the thatch.
3315,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3316,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"It was dark in the porch, but our scythes we felt,"
3317,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And thrust the whetstone under the belt.
3318,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3319,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Through the cold garden boughs we went
3320,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Where the tumbling roses shed their scent.
3321,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3322,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Then out a-gates and away we strode
3323,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"O'er the dewy straws on the dusty road,"
3324,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3325,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And there was the mead by the town-reeve's close
3326,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Where the hedge was sweet with the wilding rose.
3327,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3328,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Then into the mowing grass we went
3329,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Ere the very last of the night was spent.
3330,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3331,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"Young was the moon, and he was gone,"
3332,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,So we whet our scythes by the stars alone:
3333,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3334,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,But or ever the long blades felt the hay
3335,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Afar in the East the dawn was grey.
3336,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3337,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Or ever we struck our earliest stroke
3338,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,The thrush in the hawthorn-bush awoke.
3339,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3340,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,While yet the bloom of the swathe was dim
3341,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,The blackbird's bill had answered him.
3342,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3343,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Ere half of the road to the river was shorn
3344,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,The sunbeam smote the twisted thorn.
3345,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3346,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3347,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3348,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Now wide was the way 'twixt the standing grass
3349,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"For the townsfolk unto the mote to pass,"
3350,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3351,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And so when all our work was done
3352,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"We sat to breakfast in the sun,"
3353,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3354,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,While down in the stream the dragon-fly
3355,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,'Twixt the quivering rushes flickered by;
3356,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3357,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And though our knives shone sharp and white
3358,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,The swift bleak heeded not the sight.
3359,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3360,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,So when the bread was done away
3361,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"We looked along the new-shorn hay,"
3362,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3363,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And heard the voice of the gathering-horn
3364,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Come over the garden and the corn;
3365,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3366,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,For the wind was in the blossoming wheat
3367,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And drave the bees in the lime-boughs sweet.
3368,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3369,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"Then loud was the horn's voice drawing near,"
3370,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And it hid the talk of the prattling weir.
3371,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3372,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And now was the horn on the pathway wide
3373,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,That we had shorn to the river-side.
3374,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3375,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"So up we stood, and wide around"
3376,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,We sheared a space by the Elders' Mound;
3377,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3378,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And at the feet thereof it was
3379,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,That highest grew the June-tide grass;
3380,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3381,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And over all the mound it grew
3382,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"With clover blent, and dark of hue."
3383,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3384,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,But never aught of the Elders' Hay
3385,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,To rick or barn was borne away.
3386,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3387,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,But it was bound and burned to ash
3388,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,In the barren close by the reedy plash.
3389,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3390,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,For 'neath that mound the valiant dead
3391,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Lay hearkening words of valiance said
3392,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3393,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"When wise men stood on the Elders' Mound,"
3394,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And the swords were shining bright around.
3395,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3396,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3397,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3398,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And now we saw the banners borne
3399,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,On the first of the way that we had shorn;
3400,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,So we laid the scythe upon the sward
3401,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And girt us to the battle-sword.
3402,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3403,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,For after the banners well we knew
3404,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Were the Freemen wending two and two.
3405,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3406,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,There then that highway of the scythe
3407,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,With many a hue was brave and blythe.
3408,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3409,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And first below the Silver Chief
3410,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Upon the green was the golden sheaf.
3411,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3412,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And on the next that went by it
3413,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,The White Hart in the Park did sit.
3414,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3415,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"Then on the red the White Wings flew,"
3416,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And on the White was the Cloud-fleck blue.
3417,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3418,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Last went the Anchor of the Wrights
3419,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Beside the Ship of the Faring-Knights.
3420,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3421,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Then thronged the folk the June-tide field
3422,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"With naked sword and painted shield,"
3423,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3424,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"Till they came adown to the river-side,"
3425,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And there by the mound did they abide.
3426,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3427,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Now when the swords stood thick and white
3428,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"As the mace reeds stand in the streamless bight,"
3429,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3430,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,There rose a man on the mound alone
3431,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And over his head was the grey mail done.
3432,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3433,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,When over the new-shorn place of the field
3434,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Was nought but the steel hood and the shield.
3435,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3436,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"The face on the mound shone ruddy and hale,"
3437,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,But the hoar hair showed from the hoary mail.
3438,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3439,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And there rose a hand by the ruddy face
3440,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And shook a sword o'er the peopled place.
3441,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3442,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And there came a voice from the mound and said:
3443,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"""O sons, the days of my youth are dead,"
3444,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3445,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And gone are the faces I have known
3446,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,In the street and the booths of the goodly town.
3447,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3448,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"O sons, full many a flock have I seen"
3449,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Feed down this water-girdled green.
3450,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3451,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Full many a herd of long-horned neat
3452,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Have I seen 'twixt water-side and wheat.
3453,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3454,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Here by this water-side full oft
3455,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Have I heaved the flowery hay aloft.
3456,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3457,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And oft this water-side anigh
3458,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Have I bowed adown the wheat-stalks high.
3459,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3460,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And yet meseems I live and learn
3461,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And lore of younglings yet must earn.
3462,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3463,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"For tell me, children, whose are these"
3464,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Fair meadows of the June's increase?
3465,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3466,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"Whose are these flocks and whose the neat,"
3467,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"And whose the acres of the wheat?"""
3468,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3469,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3470,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3471,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"Scarce did we hear his latest word,"
3472,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,On the wide shield so rang the sword.
3473,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3474,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,So rang the sword upon the shield
3475,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,That the lark was hushed above the field.
3476,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3477,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Then sank the shouts and again we heard
3478,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,The old voice come from the hoary beard:
3479,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3480,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3481,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3482,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"""Yea, whose are yonder gables then,"
3483,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And whose the holy hearths of men?
3484,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"Whose are the prattling children there,"
3485,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And whose the sunburnt maids and fair?
3486,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3487,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"Whose thralls are ye, hereby that stand,"
3488,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"Bearing the freeman's sword in hand?"""
3489,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3490,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"As glitters the sun in the rain-washed grass,"
3491,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,So in the tossing swords it was;
3492,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3493,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,As the thunder rattles along and adown
3494,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,E'en so was the voice of the weaponed town.
3495,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3496,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And there was the steel of the old man's sword.
3497,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"And there was his hollow voice, and his word:"
3498,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3499,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3500,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3501,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"""Many men, many minds, the old saw saith,"
3502,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Though hereof ye be sure as death.
3503,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3504,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,For what spake the herald yestermorn
3505,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"But this, that ye were thrall-folk born;"
3506,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3507,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,That the lord that owneth all and some
3508,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Would send his men to fetch us home
3509,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3510,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"Betwixt the haysel, and the tide"
3511,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,When they shear the corn in the country-side?
3512,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3513,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"O children, Who was the lord? ye say,"
3514,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,What prayer to him did our fathers pray?
3515,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3516,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Did they hold out hands his gyves to bear?
3517,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Did their knees his high hall's pavement wear?
3518,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3519,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Is his house built up in heaven aloft?
3520,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Doth he make the sun rise oft and oft?
3521,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3522,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Doth he hold the rain in his hollow hand?
3523,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Hath he cleft this water through the land?
3524,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3525,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"Or doth he stay the summer-tide,"
3526,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And make the winter days abide?
3527,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3528,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"O children, Who is the lord? ye say,"
3529,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Have we heard his name before to-day?
3530,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3531,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"O children, if his name I know,"
3532,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,He hight Earl Hugh of the Shivering Low:
3533,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3534,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,For that herald bore on back and breast
3535,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"The Black Burg under the Eagle's Nest."""
3536,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3537,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3538,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3539,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,As the voice of the winter wind that tears
3540,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"At the eaves of the thatch and its emptied ears,"
3541,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3542,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,E'en so was the voice of laughter and scorn
3543,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,By the water-side in the mead new-shorn;
3544,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3545,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And over the garden and the wheat
3546,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Went the voice of women shrilly-sweet.
3547,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3548,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3549,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3550,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,But now by the hoary elder stood
3551,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,A carle in raiment red as blood.
3552,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3553,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"Red was his weed and his glaive was white,"
3554,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And there stood Gregory the Wright.
3555,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3556,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,So he spake in a voice was loud and strong:
3557,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"""Young is the day though the road is long;"
3558,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3559,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,There is time if we tarry nought at all
3560,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,For the kiss in the porch and the meat in the hall.
3561,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3562,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And safe shall our maidens sit at home
3563,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,For the foe by the way we wend must come.
3564,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3565,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Through the three Lavers shall we go
3566,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And raise them all against the foe.
3567,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3568,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"Then shall we wend the Downland ways,"
3569,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And all the shepherd spearmen raise.
3570,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3571,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,To Cheaping Raynes shall we come adown
3572,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And gather the bowmen of the town;
3573,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3574,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And Greenstead next we come unto
3575,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Wherein are all folk good and true.
3576,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3577,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,When we come our ways to the Outer Wood
3578,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,We shall be an host both great and good;
3579,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3580,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Yea when we come to the open field
3581,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,There shall be a many under shield.
3582,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3583,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And maybe Earl Hugh shall lie alow
3584,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And yet to the house of Heaven shall go.
3585,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3586,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,But we shall dwell in the land we love
3587,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And grudge no hallow Heaven above.
3588,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3589,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"Come ye, who think the time o'er long"
3590,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Till we have slain the word of wrong!
3591,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3592,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Come ye who deem the life of fear
3593,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,On this last day hath drawn o'er near!
3594,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3595,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Come after me upon the road
3596,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"That leadeth to the Erne's abode."""
3597,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3598,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3599,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3600,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Down then he leapt from off the mound
3601,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And back drew they that were around
3602,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3603,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Till he was foremost of all those
3604,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Betwixt the river and the close.
3605,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3606,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And uprose shouts both glad and strong
3607,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,As followed after all the throng;
3608,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3609,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"And overhead the banners flapped,"
3610,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,As we went on our ways to all that happed.
3611,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3612,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3613,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3614,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,The fields before the Shivering Low
3615,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Of many a grief of manfolk know;
3616,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3617,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,There may the autumn acres tell
3618,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"Of how men met, and what befell."
3619,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3620,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,The Black Burg under the Eagle's nest
3621,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Shall tell the tale as it liketh best.
3622,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3623,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And sooth it is that the River-land
3624,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Lacks many an autumn-gathering hand.
3625,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3626,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And there are troth-plight maids unwed
3627,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Shall deem awhile that love is dead;
3628,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3629,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And babes there are to men shall grow
3630,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Nor ever the face of their fathers know.
3631,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3632,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And yet in the Land by the River-side
3633,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Doth never a thrall or an earl's man bide;
3634,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3635,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,For Hugh the Earl of might and mirth
3636,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,Hath left the merry days of Earth;
3637,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,
3638,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,"And we live on in the land we love,"
3639,THE FOLK-MOTE BY THE RIVER,And grudge no hallow Heaven above.

3667,THE VOICE OF TOIL,
3668,THE VOICE OF TOIL,"Where home is a hovel and dull we grovel,"
3669,THE VOICE OF TOIL,Forgetting that the world is fair;

3756,THE DAY IS COMING,"Come hither, lads, and hearken,"
3757,THE DAY IS COMING,"for a tale there is to tell,"
3758,THE DAY IS COMING,"Of the wonderful days a-coming, when all"
3759,THE DAY IS COMING,shall be better than well.
3760,THE DAY IS COMING,
3761,THE DAY IS COMING,"And the tale shall be told of a country,"
3762,THE DAY IS COMING,"a land in the midst of the sea,"
3763,THE DAY IS COMING,And folk shall call it England
3764,THE DAY IS COMING,in the days that are going to be.
3765,THE DAY IS COMING,
3766,THE DAY IS COMING,There more than one in a thousand
3767,THE DAY IS COMING,"in the days that are yet to come,"
3768,THE DAY IS COMING,"Shall have some hope of the morrow,"
3769,THE DAY IS COMING,some joy of the ancient home.
3770,THE DAY IS COMING,
3771,THE DAY IS COMING,
3772,THE DAY IS COMING,
3773,THE DAY IS COMING,"For then, laugh not, but listen"
3774,THE DAY IS COMING,"to this strange tale of mine,"
3775,THE DAY IS COMING,All folk that are in England
3776,THE DAY IS COMING,shall be better lodged than swine.
3777,THE DAY IS COMING,
3778,THE DAY IS COMING,"Then a man shall work and bethink him,"
3779,THE DAY IS COMING,"and rejoice in the deeds of his hand,"
3780,THE DAY IS COMING,Nor yet come home in the even
3781,THE DAY IS COMING,too faint and weary to stand.
3782,THE DAY IS COMING,
3783,THE DAY IS COMING,Men in that time a-coming
3784,THE DAY IS COMING,shall work and have no fear
3785,THE DAY IS COMING,For to-morrow's lack of earning
3786,THE DAY IS COMING,and the hunger-wolf anear.
3787,THE DAY IS COMING,
3788,THE DAY IS COMING,"I tell you this for a wonder,"
3789,THE DAY IS COMING,that no man then shall be glad
3790,THE DAY IS COMING,Of his fellow's fall and mishap
3791,THE DAY IS COMING,to snatch at the work he had.
3792,THE DAY IS COMING,
3793,THE DAY IS COMING,For that which the worker winneth
3794,THE DAY IS COMING,"shall then be his indeed,"
3795,THE DAY IS COMING,Nor shall half be reaped for nothing
3796,THE DAY IS COMING,by him that sowed no seed.
3797,THE DAY IS COMING,
3798,THE DAY IS COMING,O strange new wonderful justice!
3799,THE DAY IS COMING,But for whom shall we gather the gain?
3800,THE DAY IS COMING,"For ourselves and for each of our fellows,"
3801,THE DAY IS COMING,and no hand shall labour in vain.
3802,THE DAY IS COMING,
3803,THE DAY IS COMING,"Then all Mine and all Thine shall be Ours,"
3804,THE DAY IS COMING,and no more shall any man crave
3805,THE DAY IS COMING,For riches that serve for nothing
3806,THE DAY IS COMING,but to fetter a friend for a slave.
3807,THE DAY IS COMING,
3808,THE DAY IS COMING,And what wealth then shall be left us
3809,THE DAY IS COMING,when none shall gather gold
3810,THE DAY IS COMING,"To buy his friend in the market,"
3811,THE DAY IS COMING,and pinch and pine the sold?
3812,THE DAY IS COMING,
3813,THE DAY IS COMING,"Nay, what save the lovely city,"
3814,THE DAY IS COMING,"and the little house on the hill,"
3815,THE DAY IS COMING,"And the wastes and the woodland beauty,"
3816,THE DAY IS COMING,and the happy fields we till;
3817,THE DAY IS COMING,
3818,THE DAY IS COMING,"And the homes of ancient stories,"
3819,THE DAY IS COMING,the tombs of the mighty dead;
3820,THE DAY IS COMING,"And the wise men seeking out marvels,"
3821,THE DAY IS COMING,and the poet's teeming head;
3822,THE DAY IS COMING,
3823,THE DAY IS COMING,And the painter's hand of wonder;
3824,THE DAY IS COMING,"and the marvellous fiddle-bow,"
3825,THE DAY IS COMING,And the banded choirs of music:
3826,THE DAY IS COMING,all those that do and know.
3827,THE DAY IS COMING,
3828,THE DAY IS COMING,"For all these shall be ours and all men's,"
3829,THE DAY IS COMING,nor shall any lack a share
3830,THE DAY IS COMING,Of the toil and the gain of living
3831,THE DAY IS COMING,in the days when the world grows fair.
3832,THE DAY IS COMING,
3833,THE DAY IS COMING,
3834,THE DAY IS COMING,
3835,THE DAY IS COMING,Ah! such are the days that shall be!
3836,THE DAY IS COMING,But what are the deeds of to-day
3837,THE DAY IS COMING,"In the days of the years we dwell in,"
3838,THE DAY IS COMING,that wear our lives away?
3839,THE DAY IS COMING,
3840,THE DAY IS COMING,"Why, then, and for what are we waiting?"
3841,THE DAY IS COMING,There are three words to speak;
3842,THE DAY IS COMING,"WE WILL IT, and what is the foeman"
3843,THE DAY IS COMING,but the dream-strong wakened and weak?
3844,THE DAY IS COMING,
3845,THE DAY IS COMING,O why and for what are we waiting?
3846,THE DAY IS COMING,"while our brothers droop and die,"
3847,THE DAY IS COMING,And on every wind of the heavens
3848,THE DAY IS COMING,a wasted life goes by.
3849,THE DAY IS COMING,
3850,THE DAY IS COMING,How long shall they reproach us
3851,THE DAY IS COMING,"where crowd on crowd they dwell,"
3852,THE DAY IS COMING,"Poor ghosts of the wicked city,"
3853,THE DAY IS COMING,the gold-crushed hungry hell?
3854,THE DAY IS COMING,
3855,THE DAY IS COMING,"Through squalid life they laboured,"
3856,THE DAY IS COMING,"in sordid grief they died,"
3857,THE DAY IS COMING,"Those sons of a mighty mother,"
3858,THE DAY IS COMING,those props of England's pride.
3859,THE DAY IS COMING,
3860,THE DAY IS COMING,"They are gone; there is none can undo it,"
3861,THE DAY IS COMING,nor save our souls from the curse;
3862,THE DAY IS COMING,"But many a million cometh,"
3863,THE DAY IS COMING,and shall they be better or worse?
3864,THE DAY IS COMING,
3865,THE DAY IS COMING,"It is we must answer and hasten,"
3866,THE DAY IS COMING,and open wide the door
3867,THE DAY IS COMING,"For the rich man's hurrying terror,"
3868,THE DAY IS COMING,and the slow-foot hope of the poor.
3869,THE DAY IS COMING,
3870,THE DAY IS COMING,"Yea, the voiceless wrath of the wretched,"
3871,THE DAY IS COMING,"and their unlearned discontent,"
3872,THE DAY IS COMING,We must give it voice and wisdom
3873,THE DAY IS COMING,till the waiting-tide be spent.
3874,THE DAY IS COMING,
3875,THE DAY IS COMING,

3877,THE DAY IS COMING,"Come, then, since all things call us,"
3878,THE DAY IS COMING,"the living and the dead,"
3879,THE DAY IS COMING,And o'er the weltering tangle
3880,THE DAY IS COMING,a glimmering light is shed.
3881,THE DAY IS COMING,
3882,THE DAY IS COMING,"Come, then, let us cast off fooling,"
3883,THE DAY IS COMING,"and put by ease and rest,"
3884,THE DAY IS COMING,For the Cause alone is worthy
3885,THE DAY IS COMING,till the good days bring the best.
3886,THE DAY IS COMING,
3887,THE DAY IS COMING,"Come, join in the only battle"
3888,THE DAY IS COMING,"wherein no man can fail,"
3889,THE DAY IS COMING,"Where whoso fadeth and dieth,"
3890,THE DAY IS COMING,yet his deed shall still prevail.
3891,THE DAY IS COMING,
3892,THE DAY IS COMING,"Ah! come, cast off all fooling,"

4596,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"No, no, it is she no longer;"

4620,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"And thence shall we wander away,"
4621,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,and over the ancient bridge
4622,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"By many a rose-hung hedgerow,"
4623,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,till we reach the sun-burnt ridge
4624,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,And the great trench digged by the Romans:
4625,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"there then awhile shall we stand,"
4626,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,To watch the dawn come creeping
4627,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"o'er the fragrant lovely land,"
4628,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"Till all the world awaketh,"
4629,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"and draws us down, we twain,"
4630,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,To the deeds of the field and the fold
4631,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,and the merry summer's gain.
4632,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,
4633,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"Ah thus, only thus shall I see her,"
4634,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"in dreams of the day or the night,"
4635,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,When my soul is beguiled of its sorrow
4636,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,to remember past delight.
4637,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,She is gone. She was and she is not;
4638,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,there is no such thing on the earth
4639,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,But e'en as a picture painted;
4640,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,and for me there is void and dearth
4641,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,That I cannot name or measure.
4642,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"Yet for me and all these she died,"
4643,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"E'en as she lived for awhile,"
4644,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,that the better day might betide.
4645,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"Therefore I live, and I shall live"
4646,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,till the last day's work shall fail.
4647,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,Have patience now but a little
4648,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,and I will tell you the tale
4649,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"Of how and why she died,"
4650,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"And why I am weak and worn,"
4651,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,And have wandered away to the meadows
4652,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,and the place where I was born;
4653,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,But here and to-day I cannot;
4654,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,for ever my thought will stray
4655,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,To that hope fulfilled for a little
4656,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,and the bliss of the earlier day.
4657,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,Of the great world's hope and anguish
4658,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,to-day I scarce can think;
4659,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"Like a ghost, from the lives of the living"
4660,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,and their earthly deeds I shrink.
4661,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,I will go adown by the water
4662,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"and over the ancient bridge,"
4663,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,And wend in our footsteps of old
4664,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"till I come to the sun-burnt ridge,"
4665,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,And the great trench digged by the Romans;
4666,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"and thence awhile will I gaze,"
4667,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,And see three teeming counties
4668,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,stretch out till they fade in the haze;
4669,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,And in all the dwellings of man
4670,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"that thence mine eyes shall see,"
4671,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,What man as hapless as I am
4672,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,beneath the sun shall be?
4673,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,
4674,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"O fool, what words are these?"
4675,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"Thou hast a sorrow to nurse,"
4676,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,And thou hast been bold and happy;
4677,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"but these, if they utter a curse,"
4678,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"No sting it has and no meaning,"
4679,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,it is empty sound on the air.
4680,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"Thy life is full of mourning,"
4681,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"and theirs so empty and bare,"
4682,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,That they have no words of complaining;
4683,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,nor so happy have they been
4684,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,That they may measure sorrow
4685,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,or tell what grief may mean.
4686,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,
4687,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,"And thou; thou hast deeds to do,"
4688,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,and toil to meet thee soon;
4689,THE HALF OF LIFE GONE,Depart and ponder on these

6080,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And nought of all the Queen's array.
6081,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6082,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Yet saw he betwixt board and door,"
6083,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,A slim maid tread the chequered floor.
6084,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6085,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Her gown of green so fair was wrought,"
6086,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,That clad her body seemed with nought
6087,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6088,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"But blossoms of the summer-tide,"
6089,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"That wreathed her, limbs and breast and side."
6090,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6091,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And, stepping towards him daintily,"
6092,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,A basket in her hand had she.
6093,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6094,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And as she went, from head to feet,"
6095,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Surely was she most dainty-sweet.
6096,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6097,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Love floated round her, and her eyes"
6098,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Gazed from her fairness glad and wise;
6099,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6100,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,But babbling-loud the guests were grown;
6101,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Unnoted was she and unknown.
6102,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6103,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6104,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6105,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Now Goldilocks she sat beside,"
6106,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,But nothing changed was the Queenly bride;
6107,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6108,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Yea too, and Goldilocks the Swain"
6109,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Was grown but dull and dazed again.
6110,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6111,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"The Queen smiled o'er the guest-rich board,"
6112,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Although his wine the Maiden poured;
6113,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6114,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Though from his dish the Maiden ate,"
6115,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,The Queen sat happy and sedate.
6116,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6117,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,But now the Maiden fell to speak
6118,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,From lips that well-nigh touched his cheek:
6119,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6120,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""O Goldilocks, dost thou forget?"
6121,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Or mindest thou the mirk-wood yet?
6122,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6123,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Forgettest thou the hunger-pain
6124,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And all thy young life made but vain?
6125,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6126,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"How there was nought to help or aid,"
6127,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"But for poor Goldilocks the Maid?"""
6128,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6129,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"She murmured, ""Each to each we two,"
6130,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Our faces from the wood-mirk grew.
6131,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6132,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Hast thou forgot the grassy place,"
6133,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And love betwixt us face to face?
6134,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6135,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Hast thou forgot how fair I deemed
6136,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Thy face? How fair thy garment seemed?
6137,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6138,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Thy kisses on my shoulders bare,"
6139,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Through rents of the poor raiment there?
6140,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6141,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,My arms that loved thee nought unkissed
6142,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,All o'er from shoulder unto wrist?
6143,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6144,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Hast thou forgot how brave thou wert,"
6145,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Thou with thy fathers' weapon girt;
6146,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6147,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,When underneath the bramble-bush
6148,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"I quaked like river-shaken rash,"
6149,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6150,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Wondering what new-wrought shape of death
6151,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Should quench my new love-quickened breath?
6152,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6153,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Or else: forget'st thou, Goldilocks,"
6154,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Thine own land of the wheaten shocks?
6155,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6156,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Thy mother and thy sisters dear,"
6157,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Thou said'st would bide thy true-love there?
6158,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6159,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Hast thou forgot? Hast thou forgot?
6160,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"O love, my love, I move thee not."""
6161,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6162,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6163,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6164,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Silent the fair Queen sat and smiled,"
6165,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And heeded nought the Angel's child,"
6166,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6167,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,For like an image fashioned fair
6168,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Still sat the Swain with empty stare.
6169,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6170,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"These words seemed spoken not, but writ"
6171,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,As foolish tales through night-dreams flit.
6172,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6173,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Vague pictures passed before his sight,"
6174,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,As in the first dream of the night.
6175,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6176,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6177,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6178,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"But the Maiden opened her basket fair,"
6179,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And set two doves on the table there.
6180,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6181,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And soft they cooed, and sweet they billed"
6182,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Like man and maid with love fulfilled.
6183,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6184,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Therewith the Maiden reached a hand
6185,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,To a dish that on the board did stand;
6186,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6187,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And she crumbled a share of the spice-loaf brown,"
6188,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And the Swain upon her hand looked down;
6189,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6190,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Then unto the fowl his eyes he turned;
6191,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And as in a dream his bowels yearned
6192,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6193,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,For somewhat that he could not name;
6194,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And into his heart a hope there came.
6195,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6196,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And still he looked on the hands of the Maid,"
6197,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,As before the fowl the crumbs she laid.
6198,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6199,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And he murmured low, ""O Goldilocks!"
6200,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Were we but amid the wheaten shocks!"""
6201,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6202,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Then the false Queen knit her brows and laid
6203,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,A fair white hand by the hand of the Maid.
6204,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6205,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"He turned his eyes away thereat,"
6206,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And closer to the Maiden sat.
6207,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6208,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6209,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6210,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,But the queen-bird now the carle-bird fed
6211,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Till all was gone of the sugared bread.
6212,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6213,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Then with wheedling voice for more he craved,"
6214,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And the Maid a share from the spice-loaf shaved;
6215,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6216,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And the crumbs within her hollow hand
6217,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,She held where the creeping doves did stand.
6218,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6219,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"But Goldilocks, he looked and longed,"
6220,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And saw how the carle the queen-bird wronged.
6221,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6222,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,For when she came to the hand to eat
6223,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,The hungry queen-bird thence he beat.
6224,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6225,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Then Goldilocks the Swain spake low:
6226,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""Foul fall thee, bird, thou doest now"
6227,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6228,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"As I to Goldilocks, my sweet,"
6229,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Who gave my hungry mouth to eat."""
6230,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6231,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"He felt her hand as he did speak,"
6232,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,He felt her face against his cheek.
6233,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6234,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"He turned and stood in the evil hall,"
6235,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And swept her up in arms withal.
6236,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6237,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Then was there hubbub wild and strange,"
6238,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And swiftly all things there 'gan change.
6239,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6240,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"The fair Queen into a troll was grown,"
6241,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"A one-eyed, bow-backed, haggard crone."
6242,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6243,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And though the hall was yet full fair,"
6244,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And bright the sunshine streamed in there,"
6245,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6246,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,On evil shapes it fell forsooth:
6247,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Swine-heads; small red eyes void of ruth;
6248,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6249,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And bare-boned bodies of vile things,"
6250,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And evil-feathered bat-felled wings.
6251,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6252,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And all these mopped and mowed and grinned,"
6253,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And sent strange noises down the wind.
6254,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6255,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,There stood those twain unchanged alone
6256,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,To face the horror of the crone;
6257,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6258,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,She crouched against them by the board;
6259,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And cried the Maid: ""Thy sword, thy sword!"
6260,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6261,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Thy sword, O Goldilocks! For see"
6262,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"She will not keep her oath to me."""
6263,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6264,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Out flashed the blade therewith. He saw
6265,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"The foul thing sidelong toward them draw,"
6266,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6267,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Holding within her hand a cup
6268,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Wherein some dreadful drink seethed up.
6269,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6270,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Then Goldilocks cried out and smote,"
6271,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And the sharp blade sheared the evil throat.
6272,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6273,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,The head fell noseling to the floor;
6274,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"The liquor from the cup did pour,"
6275,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6276,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And ran along a sparkling flame
6277,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,That nigh unto their footsoles came.
6278,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6279,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Then empty straightway was the hall,"
6280,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Save for those twain, and she withal."
6281,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6282,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"So fled away the Maid and Man,"
6283,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And down the stony stairway ran.
6284,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6285,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6286,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6287,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Fast fled they o'er the sunny grass,"
6288,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Yet but a little way did pass
6289,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6290,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Ere cried the Maid: ""Now cometh forth"
6291,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,The snow-white ice-bear of the North;
6292,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6293,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Turn, Goldilocks, and heave up sword!"""
6294,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Then fast he stood upon the sward,"
6295,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6296,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And faced the beast, that whined and cried,"
6297,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And shook his head from side to side.
6298,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6299,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"But round him the Swain danced and leaped,"
6300,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And soon the grisly head he reaped.
6301,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6302,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And then the ancient blade he sheathed,"
6303,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And ran unto his love sweet-breathed;
6304,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6305,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And caught her in his arms and ran
6306,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Fast from that house, the bane of man."
6307,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6308,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6309,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6310,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Yet therewithal he spake her soft
6311,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And kissed her over oft and oft,"
6312,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6313,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Until from kissed and trembling mouth
6314,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"She cried: ""The Dragon of the South!"""
6315,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6316,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"He set her down and turned about,"
6317,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And drew the eager edges out.
6318,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6319,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And therewith scaly coil on coil
6320,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Reared 'gainst his face the mouth aboil:
6321,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6322,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,The gaping jaw and teeth of dread
6323,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Was dark 'twixt heaven and his head.
6324,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6325,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"But with no fear, no thought, no word,"
6326,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,He thrust the thin-edged ancient sword.
6327,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6328,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And the hot blood ran from the hairy throat,"
6329,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And set the summer grass afloat.
6330,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6331,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Then back he turned and caught her hand,"
6332,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And never a minute did they stand.
6333,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6334,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"But as they ran on toward the wood,"
6335,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,He deemed her swift feet fair and good.
6336,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6337,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6338,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6339,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,She looked back o'er her shoulder fair:
6340,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""The whelming poison-pool is here;"
6341,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6342,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And now availeth nought the blade:
6343,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,O if my cherished trees might aid!
6344,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6345,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,But now my feet fail. Leave me then!
6346,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And hold my memory dear of men."""
6347,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6348,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,He caught her in his arms again;
6349,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Of her dear side was he full fain.
6350,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6351,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Her body in his arms was dear:
6352,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""Sweet art thou, though we perish here!"""
6353,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6354,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Like quicksilver came on the flood:
6355,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"But lo, the borders of the wood!"
6356,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6357,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,She slid from out his arms and stayed;
6358,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Round a great oak her arms she laid.
6359,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6360,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""If e'er I saved thee, lovely tree,"
6361,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"From axe and saw, now succour me:"
6362,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6363,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Look how the venom creeps anigh,"
6364,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Help! lest thou see me writhe and die."""
6365,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6366,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"She crouched beside the upheaved root,"
6367,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,The bubbling venom touched her foot;
6368,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6369,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Then with a sucking gasping sound
6370,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,It ebbed back o'er the blighted ground.
6371,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6372,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6373,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6374,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Up then she rose and took his hand
6375,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And never a moment did they stand.
6376,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6377,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""Come, love,"" she cried, ""the ways I know,"
6378,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,How thick soe'er the thickets grow.
6379,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6380,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"O love, I love thee! O thine heart!"
6381,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"How mighty and how kind thou art!"""
6382,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6383,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Therewith they saw the tree-dusk lit,"
6384,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Bright grey the great boles gleamed on it.
6385,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6386,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""O flee,"" she said, ""the sword is nought"
6387,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Against the flickering fire-flaught."""
6388,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6389,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""But this availeth yet,"" said he,"
6390,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""That Hallows All our love may see."""
6391,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6392,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,He turned about and faced the glare:
6393,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""O Mother, help us, kind and fair!"
6394,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6395,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Now help me, true St. Nicholas,"
6396,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"If ever truly thine I was!"""
6397,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6398,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Therewith the wild-fire waned and paled,"
6399,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And in the wood the light nigh failed;
6400,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6401,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And all about 'twas as the night.
6402,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"He said: ""Now won is all our fight,"
6403,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6404,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And now meseems all were but good
6405,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"If thou mightst bring us from the wood."""
6406,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6407,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"She fawned upon him, face and breast;"
6408,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"She said: ""It hangs 'twixt worst and best."
6409,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6410,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And yet, O love, if thou be true,"
6411,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"One thing alone thou hast to do."""
6412,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6413,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Sweetly he kissed her, cheek and chin:"
6414,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""What work thou biddest will I win."""
6415,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6416,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""O love, my love, I needs must sleep;"
6417,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Wilt thou my slumbering body keep,"
6418,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6419,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And, toiling sorely, still bear on"
6420,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"The love thou seemest to have won?"""
6421,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6422,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""O easy toil,"" he said, ""to bless"
6423,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Mine arms with all thy loveliness."""
6424,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6425,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"She smiled; ""Yea, easy it may seem,"
6426,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,But harder is it than ye deem.
6427,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6428,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"For hearken! Whatso thou mayst see,"
6429,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Piteous as it may seem to thee,"
6430,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6431,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Heed not nor hearken! bear me forth,"
6432,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,As though nought else were aught of worth.
6433,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6434,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,For all earth's wealth that may be found
6435,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Lay me not sleeping on the ground,"
6436,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6437,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"To help, to hinder, or to save!"
6438,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Or there for me thou diggest a grave."""
6439,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6440,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6441,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6442,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"He took her body on his arm,"
6443,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Her slumbering head lay on his barm.
6444,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6445,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Then glad he bore her on the way,"
6446,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And the wood grew lighter with the day.
6447,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6448,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"All still it was, till suddenly"
6449,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,He heard a bitter wail near by.
6450,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6451,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Yet on he went until he heard
6452,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,The cry become a shapen word:
6453,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6454,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""Help me, O help, thou passer by!"
6455,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Turn from the path, let me not die!"
6456,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6457,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,I am a woman; bound and left
6458,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"To perish; of all help bereft."""
6459,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6460,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Then died the voice out in a moan;
6461,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"He looked upon his love, his own,"
6462,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6463,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And minding all she spake to him
6464,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Strode onward through the wild-wood dim.
6465,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6466,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,But lighter grew the woodland green
6467,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Till clear the shapes of things were seen.
6468,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6469,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And therewith wild halloos he heard,"
6470,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And shrieks, and cries of one afeard."
6471,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6472,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Nigher it grew and yet more nigh
6473,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Till burst from out a brake near by
6474,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6475,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"A woman bare of breast and limb,"
6476,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Who turned a piteous face to him
6477,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6478,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,E'en as she ran: for hard at heel
6479,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Followed a man with brandished steel,"
6480,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6481,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And yelling mouth. Then the Swain stood
6482,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,One moment in the glimmering wood
6483,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6484,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Trembling, ashamed: Yet now grown wise"
6485,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Deemed all a snare for ears and eyes.
6486,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6487,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,So onward swiftlier still he strode
6488,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And cast all thought on his fair load.
6489,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6490,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And yet in but a little space
6491,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Back came the yelling shrieking chase,"
6492,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6493,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And well-nigh gripped now by the man,"
6494,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Straight unto him the woman ran;
6495,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6496,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And underneath the gleaming steel
6497,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,E'en at his very feet did kneel.
6498,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6499,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"She looked up; sobs were all her speech,"
6500,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Yet sorely did her face beseech.
6501,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6502,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"While o'er her head the chaser stared,"
6503,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Shaking aloft the edges bared.
6504,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6505,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Doubted the Swain, and a while did stand"
6506,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,As she took his coat-lap in her hand.
6507,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6508,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Upon his hand he felt her breath
6509,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Hot with the dread of present death.
6510,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6511,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Sleek was her arm on his scarlet coat,"
6512,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,The sobbing passion rose in his throat.
6513,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6514,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,But e'en therewith he looked aside
6515,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And saw the face of the sleeping bride.
6516,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6517,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Then he tore his coat from the woman's hand,"
6518,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And never a moment there did stand.
6519,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6520,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,But swiftly thence away he strode
6521,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Along the dusky forest road.
6522,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6523,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And there rose behind him laughter shrill,"
6524,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And then was the windless wood all still,"
6525,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6526,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"He looked around o'er all the place,"
6527,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,But saw no image of the chase.
6528,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6529,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And as he looked the night-mirk now
6530,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,O'er all the tangled wood 'gan flow.
6531,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6532,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Then stirred the sweetling that he bore,"
6533,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And she slid adown from his arms once more.
6534,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6535,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Nought might he see her well-loved face;
6536,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,But he felt her lips in the mirky place.
6537,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6538,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""'Tis night,"" she said, ""and the false day's gone,"
6539,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And we twain in the wild-wood all alone.
6540,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6541,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Night o'er the earth; so rest we here
6542,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Until to-morrow's sun is clear.
6543,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6544,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,For overcome is every foe
6545,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And home to-morrow shall we go."""
6546,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6547,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"So 'neath the trees they lay, those twain,"
6548,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And to them the darksome night was gain.
6549,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6550,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,But when the morrow's dawn was grey
6551,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,They woke and kissed whereas they lay.
6552,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6553,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And when on their feet they came to stand
6554,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Swain Goldilocks stretched out his hand.
6555,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6556,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And he spake: ""O love, my love indeed,"
6557,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Where now is gone thy goodly weed?
6558,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6559,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"For again thy naked feet I see,"
6560,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And thy sweet sleek arms so kind to me.
6561,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6562,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Through thy rent kirtle once again
6563,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Thy shining shoulder showeth plain."""
6564,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6565,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,She blushed as red as the sun-sweet rose:
6566,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""My garments gay were e'en of those"
6567,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6568,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,That the false Queen dight to slay my heart;
6569,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And sore indeed was their fleshly smart.
6570,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6571,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Yet must I bear them, well-beloved,"
6572,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Until thy truth and troth was proved
6573,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6574,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And this tattered coat is now for a sign
6575,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,That thou hast won me to be thine.
6576,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6577,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Now wilt thou lead along thy maid
6578,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"To meet thy kindred unafraid."""
6579,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6580,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,As stoops the falcon on the dove
6581,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,He cast himself about her love.
6582,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6583,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"He kissed her over, cheek and chin,"
6584,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,He kissed the sweetness of her skin.
6585,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6586,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Then hand in hand they went their way
6587,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Till the wood grew light with the outer day.
6588,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6589,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"At last behind them lies the wood,"
6590,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And before are the Upland Acres good.
6591,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6592,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,On the hill's brow awhile they stay
6593,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,At midmorn of the merry day.
6594,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6595,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"He sheareth a deal from his kirtle meet,"
6596,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,To make her sandals for her feet.
6597,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6598,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"He windeth a wreath of the beechen tree,"
6599,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Lest men her shining shoulders see.
6600,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6601,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And a wreath of woodbine sweet, to hide"
6602,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,The rended raiment of her side;
6603,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6604,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And a crown of poppies red as wine,"
6605,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Lest on her head the hot sun shine.
6606,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6607,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,She kissed her love withal and smiled:
6608,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""Lead forth, O love, the Woodland Child!"
6609,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6610,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Most meet and right meseems it now
6611,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,That I am clad with the woodland bough.
6612,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6613,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,For betwixt the oak-tree and the thorn
6614,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Meseemeth erewhile was I born.
6615,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6616,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And if my mother aught I knew,"
6617,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,It was of the woodland folk she grew.
6618,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6619,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And O that thou art well at ease
6620,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"To wed the daughter of the trees!"""
6621,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6622,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Now Goldilocks and Goldilocks
6623,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Go down amidst the wheaten shocks,"
6624,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6625,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"But when anigh to the town they come,"
6626,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Lo there is the wain a-wending home,"
6627,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6628,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And many a man and maid beside,"
6629,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Who tossed the sickles up, and cried:"
6630,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6631,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""O Goldilocks, now whither away?"
6632,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And what wilt thou with the woodland may?"""
6633,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6634,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""O this is Goldilocks my bride,"
6635,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And we come adown from the wild-wood side,"
6636,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6637,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And unto the Fathers' House we wend
6638,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"To dwell therein till life shall end."""
6639,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6640,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""Up then on the wain, that ye may see"
6641,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,From afar how thy mother bideth thee.
6642,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6643,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,That ye may see how kith and kin
6644,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Abide thee, bridal brave to win."""
6645,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6646,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,So Goldilocks and Goldilocks
6647,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Sit high aloft on the wheaten shocks,"
6648,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6649,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And fair maids sing before the wain,"
6650,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,For all of Goldilocks are fain.

6652,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6653,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6654,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"But when they came to the Fathers' door,"
6655,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,There stood his mother old and hoar.
6656,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6657,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"Yet was her hair with grey but blent,"
6658,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,When forth from the Upland Town he went.
6659,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6660,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,There by the door his sisters stood:
6661,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Full fair they were and fresh of blood;
6662,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6663,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Little they were when he went away;
6664,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Now each is meet for a young man's may.
6665,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6666,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""O tell me, Goldilocks, my son,"

6683,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6684,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,But how long the time that is worn away!
6685,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Lo! white is my hair that was but grey.
6686,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6687,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"And lo these sisters here, thine own,"
6688,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"How tall, how meet for men-folk grown!"

6693,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"O son, O son, we are blithe and fain;"
6694,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"But the autumn drought, and the winter rain,"

6702,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6703,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,

6705,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Till they came adown from the wheaten shocks.
6706,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6707,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And there beside his love he stood
6708,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,And he saw her body sweet and good.
6709,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,
6710,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,Then round her love his arms he cast:
6711,GOLDILOCKS AND GOLDILOCKS,"""The years are as a tale gone past."

7230,MASTER OLIVER,MASTER OLIVER
7231,MASTER OLIVER,
7232,MASTER OLIVER,"Nay, they bade lead him to hunt and to tilting,"
7233,MASTER OLIVER,To set him on high in the throne of his honour
7234,MASTER OLIVER,"To judge heavy deeds: bade him handle the tiller,"
7235,MASTER OLIVER,And drive through the sea with the wind at its wildest;
7236,MASTER OLIVER,All things he was wont to hold kingly and good.
7237,MASTER OLIVER,So we led out his steed and he straight leapt upon him
7238,MASTER OLIVER,"With no word, and no looking to right nor to left,"
7239,MASTER OLIVER,And into the forest we fared as aforetime:
7240,MASTER OLIVER,"Fast on the king followed, and cheered without stinting"
7241,MASTER OLIVER,The hounds to the strife till the bear stood at bay;
7242,MASTER OLIVER,Then there he alone by the beech-trees alighted;
7243,MASTER OLIVER,"Barehanded, unarmoured, he handled the spear-shaft,"
7244,MASTER OLIVER,And blew up the death on the horn of his father;
7245,MASTER OLIVER,"Yet still in his eyes was no look of rejoicing,"
7246,MASTER OLIVER,And no life in his lips; but I likened him rather
7247,MASTER OLIVER,To King Nimrod carved fair on the back of the high-seat
7248,MASTER OLIVER,"When the candles are dying, and the high moon is streaming"
7249,MASTER OLIVER,Through window and luffer white on the lone pavement
7250,MASTER OLIVER,Whence the guests are departed in the hall of the palace.--
7251,MASTER OLIVER,"--Rode we home heavily, he with his rein loose,"
7252,MASTER OLIVER,"Feet hanging free from the stirrups, and staring"
7253,MASTER OLIVER,At a clot of the bear's blood that stained his green kirtle;--
7254,MASTER OLIVER,"Unkingly, unhappy, he rode his ways homeward."

7264,MASTER OLIVER,
7265,MASTER OLIVER,"Nay, we brought him a-board the Great Dragon one dawning,"
7266,MASTER OLIVER,When the cold bay was flecked with the crests of white billows
7267,MASTER OLIVER,And the clouds lay alow on the earth and the sea;
7268,MASTER OLIVER,"He looked not aloft as they hoisted the sail,"
7269,MASTER OLIVER,But with hand on the tiller hallooed to the shipmen
7270,MASTER OLIVER,"In a voice grown so strange, that it scarce had seemed stranger"
7271,MASTER OLIVER,"If from the ship Argo, in seemly wise woven"
7272,MASTER OLIVER,"On the guard-chamber hangings, some early grey dawning"
7273,MASTER OLIVER,"Great Jason had cried, and his golden locks wavered."
7274,MASTER OLIVER,"Then e'en as the oars ran outboard, and dashed"
7275,MASTER OLIVER,"In the wind-scattered foam and the sails bellied out,"
7276,MASTER OLIVER,"His hand dropped from the tiller, and with feet all uncertain"
7277,MASTER OLIVER,"And dull eye he wended him down to the midship,"
7278,MASTER OLIVER,And gazing about for the place of the gangway
7279,MASTER OLIVER,"Made for the gate of the bulwark half open,"
7280,MASTER OLIVER,"And stood there and stared at the swallowing sea,"
7281,MASTER OLIVER,"Then turned, and uncertain went wandering back sternward,"
7282,MASTER OLIVER,"And sat down on the deck by the side of the helmsman,"
7283,MASTER OLIVER,"Wrapt in dreams of despair; so I bade them turn shoreward,"
7284,MASTER OLIVER,And slowly he rose as the side grated stoutly
7285,MASTER OLIVER,'Gainst the stones of the quay and they cast forth the hawser.--
7286,MASTER OLIVER,"Unkingly, unhappy, he went his ways homeward."

7295,MASTER OLIVER,MASTER OLIVER
7296,MASTER OLIVER,
7297,MASTER OLIVER,"We bade gather the knights for the goodliest tilting,"
7298,MASTER OLIVER,There the ladies went lightly in glorious array;
7299,MASTER OLIVER,In the old arms we armed him whose dints well he knew
7300,MASTER OLIVER,That the night dew had dulled and the sea salt had sullied:
7301,MASTER OLIVER,On the old roan yet sturdy we set him astride;
7302,MASTER OLIVER,So he stretched forth his hand to lay hold of the spear
7303,MASTER OLIVER,"Neither laughing nor frowning, as lightly his wont was"
7304,MASTER OLIVER,When the knights are awaiting the voice of the trumpet.
7305,MASTER OLIVER,"It awoke, and back beaten from barrier to barrier"
7306,MASTER OLIVER,"Was caught up by knights' cries, by the cry of the king.--"
7307,MASTER OLIVER,--Such a cry as red Mars in the Council-room window
7308,MASTER OLIVER,"May awake with some noon when the last horn is winded,"
7309,MASTER OLIVER,And the bones of the world are dashed grinding together.
7310,MASTER OLIVER,"So it seemed to my heart, and a horror came o'er me,"
7311,MASTER OLIVER,"As the spears met, and splinters flew high o'er the field,"
7312,MASTER OLIVER,"And I saw the king stay when his course was at swiftest,"
7313,MASTER OLIVER,"His horse straining hard on the bit, and he standing"
7314,MASTER OLIVER,"Stiff and stark in his stirrups, his spear held by the midmost,"
7315,MASTER OLIVER,"His helm cast a-back, his teeth set hard together;"
7316,MASTER OLIVER,"E'en as one might, who, riding to heaven, feels round him"
7317,MASTER OLIVER,The devils unseen: then he raised up the spear
7318,MASTER OLIVER,"As to cast it away, but therewith failed his fury,"
7319,MASTER OLIVER,"He dropped it, and faintly sank back in the saddle,"
7320,MASTER OLIVER,"And, turning his horse from the press and the turmoil,"
7321,MASTER OLIVER,"Came sighing to me, and sore grieving I took him"
7322,MASTER OLIVER,"And led him away, while the lists were fallen silent"
7323,MASTER OLIVER,As a fight in a dream that the light breaketh through.--
7324,MASTER OLIVER,To the tune of the clinking of his fight-honoured armour
7325,MASTER OLIVER,"Unkingly, unhappy, he went his ways homeward."

7337,MASTER OLIVER,"His face changed with great pain, and his brow grew all furrowed,"
7338,MASTER OLIVER,As a grim tale was told there of the griefs of the lowly;
7339,MASTER OLIVER,"Till he took up the word, mid the trembling of tyrants,"
7340,MASTER OLIVER,As his calm voice and cold wrought death on ill doers--
7341,MASTER OLIVER,--E'en so might King Minos in marble there carven
7342,MASTER OLIVER,"Mid old dreaming of Crete give doom on the dead,"
7343,MASTER OLIVER,When the world and its deeds are dead too and buried.--
7344,MASTER OLIVER,"But lo, as I looked, his clenched hands were loosened,"
7345,MASTER OLIVER,"His lips grew all soft, and his eyes were beholding"
7346,MASTER OLIVER,Strange things we beheld not about and above him.
7347,MASTER OLIVER,"So he sat for a while, and then swept his robe round him"
7348,MASTER OLIVER,"And arose and departed, not heeding his people,"
7349,MASTER OLIVER,"The strange looks, the peering, the rustle and whisper;"
7350,MASTER OLIVER,"But or ever he gained the gate that gave streetward,"
7351,MASTER OLIVER,"Dull were his eyes grown, his feet were grown heavy,"
7352,MASTER OLIVER,"His lips crooned complaining, as onward he stumbled;--"

7367,MASTER OLIVER,"That men should love aught, love always as I loved!"
7368,MASTER OLIVER,"Mother and sister and the sweetling that scorned me,"
7369,MASTER OLIVER,"The wind of the autumn-tide over them sweepeth,"
7370,MASTER OLIVER,"All are departed, but this one, the dear one--"
7371,MASTER OLIVER,"I should die or he died and be no more alone,"

7477,THE NORTHERN LORD,"Depart all for a little, till my spirit grows lighter,"

7633,KING PHARAMOND,Have patience and hearken--yet shalt thou be shamed.
7634,KING PHARAMOND,
7635,KING PHARAMOND,
7636,MASTER OLIVER,MASTER OLIVER
7637,MASTER OLIVER,
7638,MASTER OLIVER,Thou shalt shine through thy shame as the sun through the haze
7639,MASTER OLIVER,When the world waiteth gladly the warm day a-coming:
7640,MASTER OLIVER,"As great as thou seem'st now, I know thee for greater"
7641,MASTER OLIVER,Than thy deeds done and told of: one day I shall know thee:
7642,MASTER OLIVER,Lying dead in my tomb I shall hear the world praising.
7643,MASTER OLIVER,
7644,MASTER OLIVER,
7645,KING PHARAMOND,KING PHARAMOND
7646,KING PHARAMOND,
7647,KING PHARAMOND,"Stay thy praise--let me speak, lest all speech depart from me."
7648,KING PHARAMOND,"--There is a place in the world, a great valley"
7649,KING PHARAMOND,"That seems a green plain from the brow of the mountains,"
7650,KING PHARAMOND,But hath knolls and fair dales when adown there thou goest:
7651,KING PHARAMOND,"There are homesteads therein with gardens about them,"
7652,KING PHARAMOND,"And fair herds of kine and grey sheep a-feeding,"
7653,KING PHARAMOND,"And willow-hung streams wend through deep grassy meadows,"
7654,KING PHARAMOND,And a highway winds through them from the outer world coming:
7655,KING PHARAMOND,"Girthed about is the vale by a grey wall of mountains,"
7656,KING PHARAMOND,Rent apart in three places and tumbled together
7657,KING PHARAMOND,In old times of the world when the earth-fires flowed forth:
7658,KING PHARAMOND,And as you wend up these away from the valley
7659,KING PHARAMOND,You think of the sea and the great world it washes;
7660,KING PHARAMOND,"But through two you may pass not, the shattered rocks shut them."
7661,KING PHARAMOND,"And up through the third there windeth a highway,"
7662,KING PHARAMOND,And its gorge is fulfilled by a black wood of yew-trees.
7663,KING PHARAMOND,"And I know that beyond, though mine eyes have not seen it,"
7664,KING PHARAMOND,A city of merchants beside the sea lieth.----
7665,KING PHARAMOND,"I adjure thee, my fosterer, by the hand of my father,"
7666,KING PHARAMOND,"By thy faith without stain, by the days unforgotten,"
7667,KING PHARAMOND,"When I dwelt in thy house ere the troubles' beginning,"
7668,KING PHARAMOND,"By thy fair wife long dead and thy sword-smitten children,"
7669,KING PHARAMOND,"By thy life without blame and thy love without blemish,"
7670,KING PHARAMOND,"Tell me how, tell me when, that fair land I may come to!"
7671,KING PHARAMOND,"Hide it not for my help, for my honour, but tell me,"
7672,KING PHARAMOND,Lest my time and thy time be lost days and confusion!
7673,KING PHARAMOND,
7674,KING PHARAMOND,
7675,MASTER OLIVER,MASTER OLIVER
7676,MASTER OLIVER,
7677,MASTER OLIVER,"O many such lands!--O my master, what ails thee?"
7678,MASTER OLIVER,"Tell me again, for I may not remember."
7679,MASTER OLIVER,"--I prayed God give thee speech, and lo God hath given it--"
7680,MASTER OLIVER,May God give me death! if I dream not this evil.
7681,MASTER OLIVER,
7682,MASTER OLIVER,
7683,KING PHARAMOND,KING PHARAMOND
7684,KING PHARAMOND,
7685,KING PHARAMOND,"Said I not when thou knew'st it, all courage should fail thee?"
7686,KING PHARAMOND,"But me--my heart fails not, I am Pharamond as ever."
7687,KING PHARAMOND,"I shall seek and shall find--come help me, my fosterer!"
7688,KING PHARAMOND,--Yet if thou shouldst ask for a sign from that country
7689,KING PHARAMOND,What have I to show thee--I plucked a blue milk-wort
7690,KING PHARAMOND,From amidst of the field where she wandered fair-footed--
7691,KING PHARAMOND,It was gone when I wakened--and once in my wallet
7692,KING PHARAMOND,I set some grey stones from the way through the forest--
7693,KING PHARAMOND,These were gone when I wakened--and once as I wandered
7694,KING PHARAMOND,A lock of white wool from a thorn-bush I gathered;
7695,KING PHARAMOND,It was gone when I wakened--the name of that country--
7696,KING PHARAMOND,"Nay, how should I know it?--but ever meseemeth"
7697,KING PHARAMOND,"'Twas not in the southlands, for sharp in the sunset"
7698,KING PHARAMOND,"And sunrise the air is, and whiles I have seen it"
7699,KING PHARAMOND,"Amid white drift of snow--ah, look up, foster-father!"
7700,KING PHARAMOND,
7701,KING PHARAMOND,
7702,MASTER OLIVER,MASTER OLIVER
7703,MASTER OLIVER,
7704,MASTER OLIVER,"O woe, woe is me that I may not awaken!"
7705,MASTER OLIVER,"Or else, art thou verily Pharamond my fosterling,"
7706,MASTER OLIVER,"The Freed and the Freer, the Wise, the World's Wonder?"
7707,MASTER OLIVER,
7708,MASTER OLIVER,
7709,KING PHARAMOND,KING PHARAMOND
7710,KING PHARAMOND,
7711,KING PHARAMOND,"Why fainteth thy great heart? nay, Oliver, hearken,"
7712,KING PHARAMOND,E'en such as I am now these five years I have been.
7713,KING PHARAMOND,Through five years of striving this dreamer and dotard
7714,KING PHARAMOND,"Has reaped glory from ruin, drawn peace from destruction."
7715,KING PHARAMOND,
7716,KING PHARAMOND,
7717,MASTER OLIVER,MASTER OLIVER
7718,MASTER OLIVER,
7719,MASTER OLIVER,"Woe's me! wit hath failed me, and all the wise counsel"
7720,MASTER OLIVER,I was treasuring up down the wind is a-drifting--
7721,MASTER OLIVER,Yet what wouldst thou have there if ever thou find it?
7722,MASTER OLIVER,Are the gates of heaven there? is Death bound there and helpless?
7723,MASTER OLIVER,
7724,MASTER OLIVER,
7725,KING PHARAMOND,KING PHARAMOND
7726,KING PHARAMOND,
7727,KING PHARAMOND,"Nay, thou askest me this not as one without knowledge,"
7728,KING PHARAMOND,For thou know'st that my love in that land is abiding.
7729,KING PHARAMOND,
7730,KING PHARAMOND,
7731,MASTER OLIVER,MASTER OLIVER
7732,MASTER OLIVER,
7733,MASTER OLIVER,Yea--woe worth the while--and all wisdom hath failed me:
7734,MASTER OLIVER,"Yet if thou wouldst tell me of her, I will hearken"
7735,MASTER OLIVER,"Without mocking or mourning, if that may avail thee."
7736,MASTER OLIVER,
7737,MASTER OLIVER,
7738,KING PHARAMOND,KING PHARAMOND
7739,KING PHARAMOND,
7740,KING PHARAMOND,"Lo, thy face is grown kind--Thou rememberest the even"
7741,KING PHARAMOND,When I first wore the crown after sore strife and mourning?
7742,KING PHARAMOND,
7743,KING PHARAMOND,
7744,MASTER OLIVER,MASTER OLIVER
7745,MASTER OLIVER,
7746,MASTER OLIVER,"Who shall ever forget it? the dead face of thy father,"
7747,MASTER OLIVER,"And thou in thy fight-battered armour above it,"
7748,MASTER OLIVER,Mid the passion of tears long held back by the battle;
7749,MASTER OLIVER,"And thy rent banner o'er thee and the ring of men mail-clad,"
7750,MASTER OLIVER,"Victorious to-day, since their ruin but a spear-length"
7751,MASTER OLIVER,"Was thrust away from them.--Son, think of thy glory"
7752,MASTER OLIVER,And e'en in such wise break the throng of these devils!

7754,MASTER OLIVER,
7755,KING PHARAMOND,KING PHARAMOND
7756,KING PHARAMOND,
7757,KING PHARAMOND,Five years are passed over since in the fresh dawning
7758,KING PHARAMOND,On the field of that fight I lay wearied and sleepless
7759,KING PHARAMOND,Till slumber came o'er me in the first of the sunrise;
7760,KING PHARAMOND,"Then as there lay my body rapt away was my spirit,"
7761,KING PHARAMOND,"And a cold and thick mist for a while was about me,"
7762,KING PHARAMOND,"And when that cleared away, lo, the mountain-walled country"
7763,KING PHARAMOND,'Neath the first of the sunrise in e'en such a spring-tide
7764,KING PHARAMOND,As the spring-tide our horse-hoofs that yestereve trampled:
7765,KING PHARAMOND,By the withy-wrought gate of a garden I found me
7766,KING PHARAMOND,'Neath the goodly green boughs of the apple full-blossomed;
7767,KING PHARAMOND,And fulfilled of great pleasure I was as I entered
7768,KING PHARAMOND,"The fair place of flowers, and wherefore I knew not."
7769,KING PHARAMOND,"Then lo, mid the birds' song a woman's voice singing."
7770,KING PHARAMOND,"Five years passed away, in the first of the sunrise."
7771,KING PHARAMOND,"[_He is silent, brooding_."

7775,MASTER OLIVER,
7776,MASTER OLIVER,"God help us if God is!--for this man, I deemed him"
7777,MASTER OLIVER,More a glory of God made man for our helping
7778,MASTER OLIVER,"Than a man that should die: all the deeds he did surely,"
7779,MASTER OLIVER,"Too great for a man's life, have undone the doer."
7780,MASTER OLIVER,
7781,MASTER OLIVER,
7782,MASTER OLIVER,KING PHARAMOND (_rousing himself_)
7783,MASTER OLIVER,
7784,MASTER OLIVER,"Thou art waiting, my fosterer, till I tell of her singing"
7785,MASTER OLIVER,And the words that she sang there: time was when I knew them;
7786,MASTER OLIVER,"But too much of strife is about us this morning,"
7787,MASTER OLIVER,And whiles I forget and whiles I remember.
7788,MASTER OLIVER,[_Falls a-musing again._
7789,MASTER OLIVER,
7790,MASTER OLIVER,
7791,MASTER OLIVER,MASTER OLIVER
7792,MASTER OLIVER,
7793,MASTER OLIVER,"_But a night's dream undid him, and he died, and his kingdom"
7794,MASTER OLIVER,"By unheard-of deeds fashioned, was tumbled together,"
7795,MASTER OLIVER,By false men and fools to be fought for and ruined._
7796,MASTER OLIVER,Such words shall my ghost see the chronicler writing
7797,MASTER OLIVER,"In the days that shall be:--ah--what wouldst thou, my fosterling?"
7798,MASTER OLIVER,Knowest thou not how words fail us awaking
7799,MASTER OLIVER,That we seemed to hear plain amid sleep and its sweetness?
7800,MASTER OLIVER,"Nay, strive not, my son, rest awhile and be silent;"
7801,MASTER OLIVER,"Or sleep while I watch thee: full fair is the garden,"
7802,MASTER OLIVER,"Perchance mid the flowers thy sweet dream may find thee,"
7803,MASTER OLIVER,And thou shalt have pleasure and peace for a little.--
7804,MASTER OLIVER,(_Aside_) And my soul shall depart ere thou wak'st peradventure.

7807,KING PHARAMOND,KING PHARAMOND
7808,KING PHARAMOND,
7809,KING PHARAMOND,"Yea, thou deemest me mad: a dream thou mayst call it,"
7810,KING PHARAMOND,"But not such a dream as thou know'st of: nay, hearken!"
7811,KING PHARAMOND,For what manner of dream then is this that remembers
7812,KING PHARAMOND,The words that she sang on that morning of glory;--
7813,KING PHARAMOND,"_O love, set a word in my mouth for our meeting;"
7814,KING PHARAMOND,Cast thy sweet arms about me to stay my hearts beating!_
7815,KING PHARAMOND,"Ah, thy silence, thy silence! nought shines on the darkness!"
7816,KING PHARAMOND,--O close-serried throng of the days that I see not!
7817,KING PHARAMOND,[_Falls a-musing again._

7822,MASTER OLIVER,"Thus the worse that shall be, the bad that is, bettereth."
7823,MASTER OLIVER,--Once more he is speechless mid evil dreams sunken.
7824,MASTER OLIVER,
7825,MASTER OLIVER,
7826,MASTER OLIVER,KING PHARAMOND (_speaking very low_).
7827,MASTER OLIVER,
7828,MASTER OLIVER,"_Hold silence, love, speak not of the sweet day departed;"
7829,MASTER OLIVER,"Cling close to me, love, lest I waken sad-hearted!_"
7830,MASTER OLIVER,[_Louder to OLIVER._
7831,MASTER OLIVER,"Thou starest, my fosterer: what strange thing beholdst thou?"
7832,MASTER OLIVER,"A great king, a strong man, that thou knewest a child once:"
7833,MASTER OLIVER,Pharamond the fair babe: Pharamond the warrior;
7834,MASTER OLIVER,"Pharamond the king, and which hast thou feared yet?"
7835,MASTER OLIVER,And why wilt thou fear then this Pharamond the lover?
7836,MASTER OLIVER,Shall I fail of my love who failed not of my fame?
7837,MASTER OLIVER,"Nay, nay, I shall live for the last gain and greatest."
7838,MASTER OLIVER,
7839,MASTER OLIVER,
7840,MASTER OLIVER,MASTER OLIVER
7841,MASTER OLIVER,
7842,MASTER OLIVER,"I know not--all counsel and wit is departed,"
7843,MASTER OLIVER,"I wait for thy will; I will do it, my master."

7845,MASTER OLIVER,
7846,KING PHARAMOND,KING PHARAMOND
7847,KING PHARAMOND,
7848,KING PHARAMOND,Through the boughs of the garden I followed the singing
7849,KING PHARAMOND,To a smooth space of sward: there the unknown desire
7850,KING PHARAMOND,"Of my soul I beheld,--wrought in shape of a woman."
7851,KING PHARAMOND,
7852,KING PHARAMOND,
7853,MASTER OLIVER,MASTER OLIVER
7854,MASTER OLIVER,
7855,MASTER OLIVER,"O ye warders of Troy-walls, join hands through the darkness,"
7856,MASTER OLIVER,"Tell us tales of the Downfall, for we too are with you!"
7857,MASTER OLIVER,
7858,MASTER OLIVER,
7859,KING PHARAMOND,KING PHARAMOND
7860,KING PHARAMOND,
7861,KING PHARAMOND,"As my twin sister, young of years was she and slender,"
7862,KING PHARAMOND,"Yellow blossoms of spring-tide her hands had been gathering,"
7863,KING PHARAMOND,But the gown-lap that held them had fallen adown
7864,KING PHARAMOND,And had lain round her feet with the first of the singing;
7865,KING PHARAMOND,"Now her singing had ceased, though yet heaved her bosom"
7866,KING PHARAMOND,As with lips lightly parted and eyes of one seeking
7867,KING PHARAMOND,"She stood face to face with the Love that she knew not,"
7868,KING PHARAMOND,The love that she longed for and waited unwitting;
7869,KING PHARAMOND,"She moved not, I breathed not--till lo, a horn winded,"
7870,KING PHARAMOND,"And she started, and o'er her came trouble and wonder,"
7871,KING PHARAMOND,Came pallor and trembling; came a strain at my heartstrings
7872,KING PHARAMOND,"As bodiless there I stretched hands toward her beauty,"
7873,KING PHARAMOND,"And voiceless cried out, as the cold mist swept o'er me."
7874,KING PHARAMOND,"Then again clash of arms, and the morning watch calling,"
7875,KING PHARAMOND,"And the long leaves and great twisted trunks of the chesnuts,"
7876,KING PHARAMOND,As I sprang to my feet and turned round to the trumpets
7877,KING PHARAMOND,And gathering of spears and unfolding of banners
7878,KING PHARAMOND,That first morn of my reign and my glory's beginning.
7879,KING PHARAMOND,
7880,KING PHARAMOND,
7881,MASTER OLIVER,MASTER OLIVER
7882,MASTER OLIVER,
7883,MASTER OLIVER,O well were we that tide though the world was against us.
7884,MASTER OLIVER,
7885,MASTER OLIVER,
7886,KING PHARAMOND,KING PHARAMOND
7887,KING PHARAMOND,
7888,KING PHARAMOND,"Hearken yet!--through that whirlwind of danger and battle,"
7889,KING PHARAMOND,"Beaten back, struggling forward, we fought without blemish"
7890,KING PHARAMOND,"On my banner spear-rent in the days of my father,"
7891,KING PHARAMOND,On my love of the land and the longing I cherished
7892,KING PHARAMOND,"For a tale to be told when I, laid in the minster,"
7893,KING PHARAMOND,"Might hear it no more; was it easy of winning,"
7894,KING PHARAMOND,"Our bread of those days? Yet as wild as the work was,"
7895,KING PHARAMOND,"Unforgotten and sweet in my heart was that vision,"
7896,KING PHARAMOND,And her eyes and her lips and her fair body's fashion
7897,KING PHARAMOND,"Blest all times of rest, rent the battle asunder,"
7898,KING PHARAMOND,Turned ruin to laughter and death unto dreaming;
7899,KING PHARAMOND,And again and thrice over again did I go there
7900,KING PHARAMOND,"Ere spring was grown winter: in the meadows I met her,"
7901,KING PHARAMOND,"By the sheaves of the corn, by the down-falling apples,"
7902,KING PHARAMOND,"Kind and calm, yea and glad, yet with eyes of one seeking."
7903,KING PHARAMOND,"--Ah the mouth of one waiting, ere all shall be over!--"
7904,KING PHARAMOND,But at last in the winter-tide mid the dark forest
7905,KING PHARAMOND,Side by side did we wend down the pass: the wind tangled
7906,KING PHARAMOND,"Mid the trunks and black boughs made wild music about us,"
7907,KING PHARAMOND,But her feet on the scant snow and the sound of her breathing
7908,KING PHARAMOND,"Made music much better: the wood thinned, and I saw her,"
7909,KING PHARAMOND,As we came to the brow of the pass; for the moon gleamed
7910,KING PHARAMOND,Bitter cold in the cloudless black sky of the winter.
7911,KING PHARAMOND,"Then the world drew me back from my love, and departing"
7912,KING PHARAMOND,I saw her sweet serious look pass into terror
7913,KING PHARAMOND,"And her arms cast abroad--and lo, clashing of armour,"
7914,KING PHARAMOND,"And a sword in my hand, and my mouth crying loud,"
7915,KING PHARAMOND,And the moon and cold steel in the doorway burst open
7916,KING PHARAMOND,And thy doughty spear thrust through the throat of the foeman
7917,KING PHARAMOND,"My dazed eyes scarce saw--thou rememberest, my fosterer?"
7918,KING PHARAMOND,
7919,KING PHARAMOND,
7920,MASTER OLIVER,MASTER OLIVER
7921,MASTER OLIVER,
7922,MASTER OLIVER,"Yea, Theobald the Constable had watched but unduly;"
7923,MASTER OLIVER,"We were taken unwares, and wild fleeing there was"
7924,MASTER OLIVER,"O'er black rock and white snow--shall such times come again, son?"
7925,MASTER OLIVER,
7926,MASTER OLIVER,
7927,KING PHARAMOND,KING PHARAMOND
7928,KING PHARAMOND,
7929,KING PHARAMOND,"Yea, full surely they shall; have thou courage, my fosterer!--"
7930,KING PHARAMOND,"Day came thronging on day, month thrust month aside,"
7931,KING PHARAMOND,"Amid battle and strife and the murder of glory,"
7932,KING PHARAMOND,And still oft and oft to that land was I led
7933,KING PHARAMOND,"And still through all longing I young in Love's dealings,"
7934,KING PHARAMOND,"Never called it a pain: though, the battle passed over,"
7935,KING PHARAMOND,"The council determined, back again came my craving:"
7936,KING PHARAMOND,"I knew not the pain, but I knew all the pleasure,"
7937,KING PHARAMOND,"When now, as the clouds o'er my fortune were parting,"
7938,KING PHARAMOND,I felt myself waxing in might and in wisdom;
7939,KING PHARAMOND,"And no city welcomed the Freed and the Freer,"
7940,KING PHARAMOND,And no mighty army fell back before rumour
7941,KING PHARAMOND,"Of Pharamond's coming, but her heart bid me thither,"
7942,KING PHARAMOND,And the blithest and kindest of kingfolk ye knew me.
7943,KING PHARAMOND,"Then came the high tide of deliverance upon us,"
7944,KING PHARAMOND,When surely if we in the red field had fallen
7945,KING PHARAMOND,The stocks and the stones would have risen to avenge us.
7946,KING PHARAMOND,"--Then waned my sweet vision midst glory's fulfilment,"
7947,KING PHARAMOND,"And still with its waning, hot waxed my desire:"
7948,KING PHARAMOND,And did ye not note then that the glad-hearted Pharamond
7949,KING PHARAMOND,"Was grown a stern man, a fierce king, it may be?"
7950,KING PHARAMOND,"Did ye deem it the growth of my manhood, the hardening"
7951,KING PHARAMOND,Of battle and murder and treason about me?
7952,KING PHARAMOND,"Nay, nay, it was love's pain, first named and first noted"
7953,KING PHARAMOND,"When a long time went past, and I might not behold her."
7954,KING PHARAMOND,"--Thou rememberest a year agone now, when the legate"
7955,KING PHARAMOND,Of the Lord of the Waters brought here a broad letter
7956,KING PHARAMOND,Full of prayers for good peace and our friendship thenceforward--
7957,KING PHARAMOND,--He who erst set a price on the lost head of Pharamond--
7958,KING PHARAMOND,"How I bade him stand up on his feet and be merry,"
7959,KING PHARAMOND,"Eat his meat by my side and drink out of my beaker,"
7960,KING PHARAMOND,In memory of days when my meat was but little
7961,KING PHARAMOND,And my drink drunk in haste between saddle and straw.
7962,KING PHARAMOND,"But lo! midst of my triumph, as I noted the feigning"
7963,KING PHARAMOND,"Of the last foeman humbled, and the hall fell a murmuring,"
7964,KING PHARAMOND,"And blithely the horns blew, _Be glad, spring prevaileth,_"
7965,KING PHARAMOND,"--As I sat there and changed not, my soul saw a vision:"
7966,KING PHARAMOND,"All folk faded away, and my love that I long for"
7967,KING PHARAMOND,"Came with raiment a-rustling along the hall pavement,"
7968,KING PHARAMOND,"Drawing near to the high-seat, with hands held out a little,"
7969,KING PHARAMOND,"Till her hallowed eyes drew me a space into heaven,"
7970,KING PHARAMOND,"And her lips moved to whisper, 'Come, love, for I weary!'"
7971,KING PHARAMOND,"Then she turned and went from me, and I heard her feet falling"
7972,KING PHARAMOND,"On the floor of the hall, e'en as though it were empty"
7973,KING PHARAMOND,Of all folk but us twain in the hush of the dawning.
7974,KING PHARAMOND,"Then again, all was gone, and I sat there a smiling"
7975,KING PHARAMOND,"On the faint-smiling legate, as the hall windows quivered"
7976,KING PHARAMOND,With the rain of the early night sweeping across them.
7977,KING PHARAMOND,"Nought slept I that night, yet I saw her without sleeping:--"
7978,KING PHARAMOND,Betwixt midnight and morn of that summer-tide was I
7979,KING PHARAMOND,Amidst of the lilies by her house-door to hearken
7980,KING PHARAMOND,If perchance in her chamber she turned amid sleeping:
7981,KING PHARAMOND,"When lo, as the East 'gan to change, and stars faded"
7982,KING PHARAMOND,"Were her feet on the stairs, and the door opened softly,"
7983,KING PHARAMOND,"And she stood on the threshold with the eyes of one seeking,"
7984,KING PHARAMOND,"And there, gathering the folds of her gown to her girdle,"
7985,KING PHARAMOND,"Went forth through the garden and followed the highway,"
7986,KING PHARAMOND,"All along the green valley, and I ever beside her,"
7987,KING PHARAMOND,Till the light of the low sun just risen was falling
7988,KING PHARAMOND,On her feet in the first of the pass--and all faded.
7989,KING PHARAMOND,"Yet from her unto me had gone forth her intent,"
7990,KING PHARAMOND,"And I saw her face set to the heart of that city,"
7991,KING PHARAMOND,"And the quays where the ships of the outlanders come to,"
7992,KING PHARAMOND,"And I said: She is seeking, and shall I not seek?"
7993,KING PHARAMOND,The sea is her prison wall; where is my prison?
7994,KING PHARAMOND,"--Yet I said: Here men praise me, perchance men may love me"
7995,KING PHARAMOND,If I live long enough for my justice and mercy
7996,KING PHARAMOND,To make them just and merciful--one who is master
7997,KING PHARAMOND,"Of many poor folk, a man pity moveth"
7998,KING PHARAMOND,"Love hath dealt with in this wise, no minstrel nor dreamer."
7999,KING PHARAMOND,The deeds that my hand might find for the doing
8000,KING PHARAMOND,Did desire undo them these four years of fight?
8001,KING PHARAMOND,And now time and fair peace in my heart have begotten
8002,KING PHARAMOND,"More desire and more pain, is the day of deeds done with?"
8003,KING PHARAMOND,Lo here for my part my bonds and my prison!--
8004,KING PHARAMOND,"Then with hands holding praise, yet with fierce heart belike"
8005,KING PHARAMOND,Did I turn to the people that I had delivered--
8006,KING PHARAMOND,And the deeds of this year passed shall live peradventure!
8007,KING PHARAMOND,But now came no solace of dreams in the night-tide
8008,KING PHARAMOND,"From that day thenceforward; yet oft in the council,"
8009,KING PHARAMOND,"Mid the hearkening folk craving for justice or mercy,"
8010,KING PHARAMOND,"Mid the righting of wrongs and the staying of ruin,"
8011,KING PHARAMOND,"Mid the ruling a dull folk, who deemed all my kingship"
8012,KING PHARAMOND,A thing due and easy as the dawning and sunset
8013,KING PHARAMOND,To the day that God made once to deal with no further--
8014,KING PHARAMOND,"--Mid all these a fair face, a sad face, could I fashion,"
8015,KING PHARAMOND,"And I said, She is seeking, and shall I not seek?"
8016,KING PHARAMOND,--Tell over the days of the year of hope's waning;
8017,KING PHARAMOND,Tell over the hours of the weary days wearing:
8018,KING PHARAMOND,"Tell over the minutes of the hours of thy waking,"
8019,KING PHARAMOND,Then wonder he liveth who fails of his longing!

8030,KING PHARAMOND,Till a month agone now at the ending of Maytide;
8031,KING PHARAMOND,And then in the first of the morning I found me
8032,KING PHARAMOND,Fulfilled of all joy at the edge of the yew-wood;
8033,KING PHARAMOND,"Then lo, her gown's flutter in the fresh breeze of morning,"
8034,KING PHARAMOND,And slower and statelier than her wont was aforetime
8035,KING PHARAMOND,And fairer of form toward the yew-wood she wended.
8036,KING PHARAMOND,But woe's me! as she came and at last was beside me
8037,KING PHARAMOND,"With sobbing scarce ended her bosom was heaving,"
8038,KING PHARAMOND,"Stained with tears was her face, and her mouth was yet quivering"
8039,KING PHARAMOND,With torment of weeping held back for a season.
8040,KING PHARAMOND,Then swiftly my spirit to the King's bed was wafted
8041,KING PHARAMOND,While still toward the sea were her weary feet wending.
8042,KING PHARAMOND,--Ah surely that day of all wrongs that I hearkened
8043,KING PHARAMOND,Mine own wrongs seemed heaviest and hardest to bear--
8044,KING PHARAMOND,Mine own wrongs and hers--till that past year of ruling
8045,KING PHARAMOND,"Seemed a crime and a folly. Night came, and I saw her"
8046,KING PHARAMOND,"Stealing barefoot, bareheaded amidst of the tulips"
8047,KING PHARAMOND,Made grey by the moonlight: and a long time Love gave me
8048,KING PHARAMOND,"To gaze on her weeping--morn came, and I wakened--"
8049,KING PHARAMOND,"I wakened and said: Through the World will I wander,"

8058,MASTER OLIVER,"To go with thee, son, if aught I might help thee?--"
8059,MASTER OLIVER,"Ah me, if thy face might gladden a little"
8060,MASTER OLIVER,I should meet the world better and mock at its mocking:

8069,KING PHARAMOND,Somewhat nigher will I be to her love and her longing.
8070,KING PHARAMOND,"Lo, to thee, friend, alone of all folk on the earth"
8071,KING PHARAMOND,These things have I told: for a true man I deem thee
8072,KING PHARAMOND,"Beyond all men call true; yea, a wise man moreover"
8073,KING PHARAMOND,And hardy and helpful; and I know thy heart surely
8074,KING PHARAMOND,That thou holdest the world nought without me thy fosterling.

8124,KING PHARAMOND,"And seen my face change to the man that they fear,"
8125,KING PHARAMOND,Yet found me not fearful nor turned from beholding:
8126,KING PHARAMOND,"Thou hast been at my triumphs, and heard the tale's ending"

8526,KING PHARAMOND,"The red shapeless moon, and the whole sea was rolling,"
8527,KING PHARAMOND,"Unresting, unvaried, as grey as the void is,"
8528,KING PHARAMOND,Toward that wall 'gainst the heavens as though rest were behind it.
8529,KING PHARAMOND,"Still onward we fared and the moon was forgotten,"

9148,AZALAIS,"With no story told, with sweet longing turned torment,"

9181,AZALAIS,"O heart, how thou faintest with hope of the gladness"
9182,AZALAIS,I may have for a little if there he abide.
9183,AZALAIS,"Soft there shalt thou sleep, love, and sweet shall thy dreams be,"
9184,AZALAIS,And sweet thy awaking amidst of the wonder
9185,AZALAIS,"Where thou art, who is nigh thee--and then, when thou seest"
9186,AZALAIS,"How the rose-boughs hang in o'er the little loft window,"
9187,AZALAIS,"And the blue bowl with roses is close to thine hand,"
9188,AZALAIS,"And over thy bed is the quilt sewn with lilies,"

9191,AZALAIS,"And thou turnest to see me there standing, and holding"
9192,AZALAIS,"Such dainties as may be, thy new hunger to stay--"
9193,AZALAIS,Then well may I hope that thou wilt not remember
9194,AZALAIS,"Thine old woes for a moment in the freshness and pleasure,"
9195,AZALAIS,And that I shall be part of thy rest for a little.
9196,AZALAIS,"And then---who shall say--wilt thou tell me thy story,"
9197,AZALAIS,"And what thou hast loved, and for what thou hast striven?"
9198,AZALAIS,"--Thou shalt see me, and my love and my pity, as thou speakest,"
9199,AZALAIS,And it may be thy pity shall mingle with mine.
9200,AZALAIS,"--And meanwhile--Ah, love, what hope may my heart hold?"
9201,AZALAIS,"For I see that thou lovest, who ne'er hast beheld me."
9202,AZALAIS,"And how should thy love change, howe'er the world changeth?"
9203,AZALAIS,"Yet meanwhile, had I dreamed of the bliss of this minute,"
9204,AZALAIS,How might I have borne to live weary and waiting!
9205,AZALAIS,
9206,AZALAIS,"Woe's me! do I fear thee? else should I not wake thee,"
9207,AZALAIS,For tending thou needest--If my hand touched thy hand
9208,AZALAIS,[_Touching him._
9209,AZALAIS,"I should fear thee the less.--O sweet friend, forgive it,"
9210,AZALAIS,"My hand and my tears, for faintly they touched thee!"
9211,AZALAIS,"He trembleth, and waketh not: O me, my darling!"
9212,AZALAIS,"Hope whispers that thou hear'st me through sleep, and wouldst waken,"
9213,AZALAIS,But for dread that thou dreamest and I should be gone.
9214,AZALAIS,"Doth it please thee in dreaming that I tremble and dread thee,"
9215,AZALAIS,"That these tears are the tears of one praying vainly,"
9216,AZALAIS,Who shall pray with no word when thou hast awakened?
9217,AZALAIS,"--Yet how shall I deal with my life if he love not,"
9218,AZALAIS,"As how should he love me, a stranger, unheard of?"
9219,AZALAIS,"--O bear witness, thou day that hast brought my love hither!"
9220,AZALAIS,"Thou sun that burst out through the mist o'er the mountains,"
9221,AZALAIS,In that moment mine eyes met the field of his sorrow--
9222,AZALAIS,"Bear witness, ye fields that have fed me and clothed me,"
9223,AZALAIS,"And air I have breathed, and earth that hast borne me--"
9224,AZALAIS,"Though I find you but shadows, and wrought but for fading,"
9225,AZALAIS,"Though all ye and God fail me,--my love shall not fail!"
9226,AZALAIS,"Yea, even if this love, that seemeth such pleasure"
9227,AZALAIS,"As earth is unworthy of, turneth to pain;"
9228,AZALAIS,"If he wake without memory of me and my weeping,"
9229,AZALAIS,With a name on his lips not mine--that I know not:
9230,AZALAIS,"If thus my hand leave his hand for the last time,"
9231,AZALAIS,And no word from his lips be kind for my comfort--
9232,AZALAIS,"If all speech fail between us, all sight fail me henceforth,"
9233,AZALAIS,If all hope and God fail me--my love shall not fail.
9234,AZALAIS,
9235,AZALAIS,"--Friend, I may not forbear: we have been here together:"
9236,AZALAIS,"My hand on thy hand has been laid, and thou trembledst."
9237,AZALAIS,"Think now if this May sky should darken above us,"
9238,AZALAIS,And the death of the world in this minute should part us--
9239,AZALAIS,"Think, my love, of the loss if my lips had not kissed thee."
9240,AZALAIS,And forgive me my hunger of no hope begotten! [_She kisses him._

9246,AZALAIS,"How with words full of love she drew near me, and kissed me."
9247,AZALAIS,"O thou kissest me yet, and thou clingest about me!"
9248,AZALAIS,"Ah, kiss me and wake me into death and deliverance!"

9254,AZALAIS,"But forgive me, for the years of my life have been lonely,"
9255,AZALAIS,And thou art come hither with the eyes of one seeking.

9286,KING PHARAMOND,Sore trembled thine arms as they fell away from me;
9287,KING PHARAMOND,"And thy voice was grown piteous with words of beseeching,"
9288,KING PHARAMOND,So that still for a little my search seemed unended.
9289,KING PHARAMOND,"--Ah, enending, unchanging desire fulfils me!"
9290,KING PHARAMOND,I cry out for thy comfort as thou clingest about me.
9291,KING PHARAMOND,"O joy hard to bear, but for memory of sorrow,"
9292,KING PHARAMOND,But for pity of past days whose bitter is sweet now!
9293,KING PHARAMOND,"_Let us speak, love, together some word of our story,"

9308,THE MUSIC,"His touch it was that would bring you to weeping,"
9309,THE MUSIC,When the summer was deepest and music most sweet:
9310,THE MUSIC,"In his footsteps ye followed the day to its dying,"
9311,THE MUSIC,Ye went forth by his gown-skirts the morning to meet:
9312,THE MUSIC,"In his place on the beaten-down orchard-grass lying,"
9313,THE MUSIC,Of the sweet ways ye pondered yet left for life's trying.
9314,THE MUSIC,
9315,THE MUSIC,"Ah, what was all dreaming of pleasure anear you,"

9317,THE MUSIC,"And ye saw his lips move, and his head bend to hear you,"
9318,THE MUSIC,As new-born and glad to his kindness ye yearned?
9319,THE MUSIC,"Ah, what was all dreaming of anguish and sorrow,"
9320,THE MUSIC,"To the time when the world in his torment was burned,"
9321,THE MUSIC,"And no god your heart from its prison might borrow,"

9342,LOVE,"Why, as the winds whereso they list shall blow,"

9347,LOVE,Deeds good to tell about when we are dead.
9348,LOVE,"Here is no pain, but rest, and easy bread;"
9349,LOVE,Yet therewith something hard to understand
9350,LOVE,Dulls the crowned work to which I set my hand.
9351,LOVE,"Ah, patience yet! his longing is well won,"
9352,LOVE,And I shall die at last and all be done.--
9353,LOVE,Such words unspoken the best man on earth

9355,LOVE,"And now he hath what he went forth to find,"
9356,LOVE,"This Pharamond is neither dull nor blind,"
9357,LOVE,"And looking upon Oliver, he saith:--"
9358,LOVE,"My friend recked nothing of his life or death,"
9359,LOVE,"Knew not my anguish then, nor now my pleasure,"
9360,LOVE,And by my crowned joy sets his lessened treasure.
9361,LOVE,"Is risk of twenty days of wind and sea,"
9362,LOVE,"Of new-born feeble headless enmity,"
9363,LOVE,"I should have scorned once, too great gift to give"
9364,LOVE,To this most faithful man that he may live?

9366,LOVE,"--Yea, was that all? my faithful, you and I,"

9368,LOVE,"The world we want not--yet, our one desire"

9370,LOVE,--I say not this to make my altar cold;
9371,LOVE,"Rather that ye, my happy ones, should hold"
9372,LOVE,Enough of memory and enough of fear
9373,LOVE,Within your hearts to keep its flame full clear;
9374,LOVE,"Rather that ye, still dearer to my heart,"
9375,LOVE,"Whom words call hapless, yet should praise your part,"
9376,LOVE,Wherein the morning and the evening sun
9377,LOVE,Are bright about a story never done;
9378,LOVE,"That those for chastening, these for joy should cling"
9379,LOVE,About the marvels that my minstrels sing.
9380,LOVE,
9381,LOVE,"Well, Pharamond fulfilled of love must turn"
9382,LOVE,Unto the folk that still he deemed would yearn
9383,LOVE,"To see his face, and hear his voice once more;"
9384,LOVE,"And he was mindful of the days passed o'er,"
9385,LOVE,And fain had linked them to these days of love;
9386,LOVE,And he perchance was fain the world to move
9387,LOVE,While love looked on; and he perchance was fain
9388,LOVE,Some pleasure of the strife of old to gain.
9389,LOVE,"Easy withal it seemed to him to land,"
9390,LOVE,And by his empty throne awhile to stand
9391,LOVE,"Amid the wonder, and then sit him down"
9392,LOVE,While folk went forth to seek the hidden crown.
9393,LOVE,
9394,LOVE,Or else his name upon the same wind borne
9395,LOVE,"As smote the world with winding of his horn,"
9396,LOVE,"His hood pulled back, his banner flung abroad,"
9397,LOVE,A gleam of sunshine on his half-drawn sword.
9398,LOVE,"--Well, he and you and I have little skill"
9399,LOVE,To know the secret of Fate's worldly will;
9400,LOVE,"Yet can I guess, and you belike may guess,"
9401,LOVE,"Yea, and e'en he mid all his lordliness,"
9402,LOVE,That much may be forgot in three years' space
9403,LOVE,"Outside my kingdom.--Gone his godlike face,"
9404,LOVE,"His calm voice, and his kindness, half akin"
9405,LOVE,"Amid a blind folk to rebuke of sin,"
9406,LOVE,"Men 'gin to think that he was great and good,"
9407,LOVE,"But hindered them from doing as they would,"
9408,LOVE,And ere they have much time to think on it
9409,LOVE,"Between their teeth another has the bit,"
9410,LOVE,And forth they run with Force and Fate behind.
9411,LOVE,"--Indeed his sword might somewhat heal the blind,"
9412,LOVE,"Were I not, and the softness I have given;"
9413,LOVE,With me for him have hope and glory striven
9414,LOVE,In other days when my tale was beginning;
9415,LOVE,"But sweet life lay beyond then for the winning,"
9416,LOVE,And now what sweetness?--blood of men to spill
9417,LOVE,Who once believed him God to heal their ill:
9418,LOVE,To break the gate and storm adown the street
9419,LOVE,Where once his coming flower-crowned girls did greet:
9420,LOVE,To deem the cry come from amidst his folk
9421,LOVE,When his own country tongue should curse his stroke--
9422,LOVE,"Nay, he shall leave to better men or worse"
9423,LOVE,His people's conquered homage and their curse.
9424,LOVE,
9425,LOVE,"So forth they go, his Oliver and he,"
9426,LOVE,"One thing at least to learn across the sea,"
9427,LOVE,That whatso needless shadows life may borrow
9428,LOVE,Love is enough amidst of joy or sorrow.
9429,LOVE,
9430,LOVE,"Love is enough--My Faithful, in your eyes"
9431,LOVE,"I see the thought, Our Lord is overwise"
9432,LOVE,"Some minutes past in what concerns him not,"
9433,LOVE,And us no more: is all his tale forgot?
9434,LOVE,"--Ah, Well-beloved, I fell asleep e'en now,"
9435,LOVE,And in my sleep some enemy did show
9436,LOVE,"Sad ghosts of bitter things, and names unknown"
9437,LOVE,For things I know--a maze with shame bestrown
9438,LOVE,And ruin and death; till e'en myself did seem
9439,LOVE,A wandering curse amidst a hopeless dream.
9440,LOVE,"--Yet see! I live, no older than of old,"
9441,LOVE,What tales soe'er of changing Time has told.
9442,LOVE,"And ye who cling to all my hand shall give,"
9443,LOVE,"Sorrow or joy, no less than I shall live."

9454,KING PHARAMOND,Better counsel in king-choosing might I have given
9455,KING PHARAMOND,"Had ye bided my coming back hither, my people:"
9456,KING PHARAMOND,And yet who shall say or foretell what Fate meaneth?
9457,KING PHARAMOND,"For that man there, the stranger, Honorius men called him,"
9458,KING PHARAMOND,"I account him the soul to King Theobald's body,"
9459,KING PHARAMOND,And the twain are one king; and a goodly king may be
9460,KING PHARAMOND,"For this people, who grasping at peace and good days,"
9461,KING PHARAMOND,Careth little who giveth them that which they long for.
9462,KING PHARAMOND,Yet what gifts have I given them; I who this even
9463,KING PHARAMOND,Turn away with grim face from the fight that should try me?
9464,KING PHARAMOND,"It is just then, I have lost: lie down, thou supplanter,"
9465,KING PHARAMOND,"In thy tomb in the minster when thy life is well over,"
9466,KING PHARAMOND,And the well-carven image of latten laid o'er thee
9467,KING PHARAMOND,"Shall live on as thou livedst, and be worthy the praising"
9468,KING PHARAMOND,Whereby folk shall remember the days of thy plenty.
9469,KING PHARAMOND,"Praising Theobald the Good and the peace that he brought them,"
9470,KING PHARAMOND,"But I--I shall live too, though no graven image"
9471,KING PHARAMOND,On the grass of the hillside shall brave the storms' beating;
9472,KING PHARAMOND,Though through days of thy plenty the people remember
9473,KING PHARAMOND,As a dim time of war the past days of King Pharamond;
9474,KING PHARAMOND,"Yet belike as time weareth, and folk turn back a little"
9475,KING PHARAMOND,"To the darkness where dreams lie and live on for ever,"
9476,KING PHARAMOND,"Even there shall be Pharamond who failed not in battle,"
9477,KING PHARAMOND,"But feared to overcome his folk who forgot him,"
9478,KING PHARAMOND,"And turned back and left them a tale for the telling,"
9479,KING PHARAMOND,"A song for the singing, that yet in some battle"
9480,KING PHARAMOND,May grow to remembrance and rend through the ruin
9481,KING PHARAMOND,As my sword rent it through in the days gone for ever.
9482,KING PHARAMOND,"So, like Enoch of old, I was not, for God took me."

9587,KING PHARAMOND,"Did I kneel to his white lips and sword-cloven bosom,"
9588,KING PHARAMOND,As from clutch of dead fingers his notched sword I caught;

9595,KING PHARAMOND,But great countries arisen for our ruin and downfall.
9596,KING PHARAMOND,"I was king of the land, when on all roads were riding"
9597,KING PHARAMOND,The legates of proud princes to pray help and give service--
9598,KING PHARAMOND,"Yea, I was a great king at last as I sat there,"
9599,KING PHARAMOND,"Peace spread far about me, and the love of all people"
9600,KING PHARAMOND,To my palace gates wafted by each wind of the heavens.
9601,KING PHARAMOND,--And where sought I all this? with what price did I buy it?
9602,KING PHARAMOND,"Nay, for thou knowest that this fair fame and fortune"
9603,KING PHARAMOND,Came stealing soft-footed to give their gifts to me:
9604,KING PHARAMOND,"And shall I, who was king once, grow griping and weary"
9605,KING PHARAMOND,"In unclosing the clenched fists of niggards who hold them,"
9606,KING PHARAMOND,"These gifts that I had once, and, having, scarce heeded?"
9607,KING PHARAMOND,"Nay, one thing I have sought, I have sought and have found it,"
9608,KING PHARAMOND,"And thou, friend, hast helped me and seest me made happy."

9656,KING PHARAMOND,"Forgive me that giftless from me thou departest,"

9660,KING PHARAMOND,"Day sighs as she sinketh back on to her pillow,"
9661,KING PHARAMOND,And her last waking breath is full sweet with the rose.
9662,KING PHARAMOND,"--In such wise depart thou, O daylight of life,"
9663,KING PHARAMOND,Loved once for the shadows that told of the dreamtide;
9664,KING PHARAMOND,Loved still for the longing whereby I remember
9665,KING PHARAMOND,That I was lone once in the world of thy making;
9666,KING PHARAMOND,"Lone wandering about on thy blind way's confusion,"
9667,KING PHARAMOND,The maze of thy paths that yet led me to love.
9668,KING PHARAMOND,"All is passed now, and passionless, faint are ye waxen,"
9669,KING PHARAMOND,Ye hours of blind seeking full of pain clean forgotten.
9670,KING PHARAMOND,If it were not that e'en now her eyes I behold not.
9671,KING PHARAMOND,"That the way lieth long to her feet that would find me,"
9672,KING PHARAMOND,"That the green seas delay yet her fair arms enfolding,"
9673,KING PHARAMOND,That the long leagues of air will not bear the cry hither

9678,KING PHARAMOND,That the sound of my trumpet floats down on the even?
9679,KING PHARAMOND,What shows will ye give me to grace my departure?
9680,KING PHARAMOND,"Hark!--the beat of the horse-hoofs, the murmur of men folk!"
9681,KING PHARAMOND,"Am I riding from battle amidst of my faithful,"
9682,KING PHARAMOND,Wild hopes in my heart of the days that are coming;
9683,KING PHARAMOND,Wild longing unsatisfied clinging about me;
9684,KING PHARAMOND,Full of faith that the summer sun elsewhere is ripening
9685,KING PHARAMOND,The fruit grown a pain for my parched lips to think of?
9686,KING PHARAMOND,"--Come back, thou poor Pharamond! come back for my pity!"
9687,KING PHARAMOND,Far afield must thou fare before the rest cometh;
9688,KING PHARAMOND,"In far lands are they raising the walls of thy prison,"
9689,KING PHARAMOND,"Forging wiles for waylaying, and fair lies for lulling,"
9690,KING PHARAMOND,The faith and the fire of the heart the world hateth.
9691,KING PHARAMOND,"In thy way wax streams fordless, and choked passes pathless,"
9692,KING PHARAMOND,"Fever lurks in the valley, and plague passeth over"
9693,KING PHARAMOND,"The sand of the plain, and with venom and fury"

9695,KING PHARAMOND,In the hollow of the mountains the wind is a-storing
9696,KING PHARAMOND,Till the keel that shall carry thee hoisteth her sail;
9697,KING PHARAMOND,"War is crouching unseen round the lands thou shalt come to,"
9698,KING PHARAMOND,With thy sword cast away and thy cunning forgotten.
9699,KING PHARAMOND,"Yea, and e'en the great lord, the great Love of thy fealty,"

9703,KING PHARAMOND,Making ready meanwhile for more days of thy kingship.
9704,KING PHARAMOND,"Faithful heart hadst thou, Pharamond, to hold fast thy treasure!"

9737,KING PHARAMOND,Pour through the dark archway to the light that awaits you
9738,KING PHARAMOND,In the chamber of daïs where I once sat among you!
9739,KING PHARAMOND,Like the shadows ye are to the shadowless glory
9740,KING PHARAMOND,Of the banquet-hall blazing with gold and light go ye:
9741,KING PHARAMOND,"There blink for a little at your king in his bravery,"
9742,KING PHARAMOND,"Then bear forth your faith to the blackness of night-tide,"
9743,KING PHARAMOND,"And fall asleep fearless of memories of Pharamond,"
9744,KING PHARAMOND,And in dim dreams dream haply that ye too are kings
9745,KING PHARAMOND,--For your dull morrow cometh that is as to-day is.
9746,KING PHARAMOND,
9747,KING PHARAMOND,"Pass on in contentment, O king, I discerned not"
9748,KING PHARAMOND,"Through the cloak of your blindness that saw nought beside thee,"
9749,KING PHARAMOND,That feared for no pain and craved for no pleasure!
9750,KING PHARAMOND,"Pass on, dead-alive, to thy place! thou art worthy:"
9751,KING PHARAMOND,Nor shalt thou grow wearier than well-worshipped idol
9752,KING PHARAMOND,"That the incense winds round in the land of the heathen,"
9753,KING PHARAMOND,"While the early and latter rains fall as God listeth,"
9754,KING PHARAMOND,And on earth that God loveth the sun riseth daily.
9755,KING PHARAMOND,"--Well art thou: for wert thou the crown of all rulers,"
9756,KING PHARAMOND,"No field shouldst thou ripen, free no frost-bounden river,"
9757,KING PHARAMOND,"Loose no heart from its love, turn no soul to salvation,"
9758,KING PHARAMOND,"Thrust no tempest aside, stay no plague in mid ocean,"
9759,KING PHARAMOND,"Yet grow unto thinking that thou wert God's brother,"
9760,KING PHARAMOND,"Till loveless death gripped thee unloved, unlamented."
9761,KING PHARAMOND,"--Pass forth, weary King, bear thy crown high to-night!"
9762,KING PHARAMOND,"Then fall asleep, fearing no cry from times bygone,"
9763,KING PHARAMOND,"But in dim dreams dream haply that thou art desired,--"
9764,KING PHARAMOND,"--For thy dull morrow cometh, and is as to-day is."
9765,KING PHARAMOND,
9766,KING PHARAMOND,"Ah, hold! now there flashes a link in the archway,"
9767,KING PHARAMOND,"And its light falleth full on thy face, O Honorius,"
9768,KING PHARAMOND,"And I know thee the land's lord, and far away fadeth"
9769,KING PHARAMOND,"My old life of a king at the sight, O thou stranger!"
9770,KING PHARAMOND,For I know thee full surely the foe the heart hateth
9771,KING PHARAMOND,For that barren fulfilment of all that it lacketh.
9772,KING PHARAMOND,I may turn away praising that those days long departed
9773,KING PHARAMOND,Departed without thee--how long had I piped then
9774,KING PHARAMOND,"Or e'er thou hadst danced, how long were my weeping"
9775,KING PHARAMOND,Ere thou hadst lamented!--What dear thing desired
9776,KING PHARAMOND,Would thy heart e'er have come to know why I craved for!
9777,KING PHARAMOND,To what crime I could think of couldst thou be consenting?
9778,KING PHARAMOND,Yet thou--well I know thee most meet for a ruler--
9779,KING PHARAMOND,"--Thou lovest not mercy, yet shalt thou be merciful;"
9780,KING PHARAMOND,"Thou joy'st not in justice, yet just shall thy dooms be;"
9781,KING PHARAMOND,"No deep hell thou dreadest, nor dream'st of high heaven;"
9782,KING PHARAMOND,No gleam of love leads thee: no gift men may give thee;
9783,KING PHARAMOND,"For no kiss, for no comfort the lone way thou wearest,"
9784,KING PHARAMOND,"A blind will without life, lest thou faint ere the end come."
9785,KING PHARAMOND,"--Yea, folly it was when I called thee my foeman;"
9786,KING PHARAMOND,From thee may I turn now with sword in the scabbard
9787,KING PHARAMOND,"Without shame or misgiving, because God hath made thee"
9788,KING PHARAMOND,A ruler for manfolk: pass on then unpitied!
9789,KING PHARAMOND,There is darkness between us till the measure's fulfilment.
9790,KING PHARAMOND,"Amidst singing thou hear'st not, fair sights that thou seest not,"
9791,KING PHARAMOND,Think this eve on the deeds thou shalt set in men's hands
9792,KING PHARAMOND,To bring fair days about for which thou hast no blessing.
9793,KING PHARAMOND,Then fall asleep fearless of dead days that return not;
9794,KING PHARAMOND,Yet dream if thou may'st that thou yet hast a hope!
9795,KING PHARAMOND,--For thy dull morrow cometh and is as to-day is.
9796,KING PHARAMOND,
9797,KING PHARAMOND,"O sweet wind of the night, wherewith now ariseth"
9798,KING PHARAMOND,"The red moon through the garden boughs frail, overladen,"
9799,KING PHARAMOND,"O faint murmuring tongue of the dream-tide triumphant,"
9800,KING PHARAMOND,"That wouldst tell me sad tales in the times long passed over,"
9801,KING PHARAMOND,"If somewhat I sicken and turn to your freshness,"
9802,KING PHARAMOND,"From no shame it is of earth's tangle and trouble,"
9803,KING PHARAMOND,"And deeds done for nought, and change that forgetteth;"
9804,KING PHARAMOND,"But for hope of the lips that I kissed on the sea-strand,"
9805,KING PHARAMOND,"But for hope of the hands that clung trembling about me,--"
9806,KING PHARAMOND,"And the breast that was heaving with words driven backward,"
9807,KING PHARAMOND,"By longing I longed for, by pain of departing,"
9808,KING PHARAMOND,"By my eyes that knew her pain, my pain that might speak not--"
9809,KING PHARAMOND,"Yea, for hope of the morn when the sea is passed over,"
9810,KING PHARAMOND,And for hope of the next moon the elm-boughs shall tangle;
9811,KING PHARAMOND,"And fresh dawn, and fresh noon, and fresh night of desire"
9812,KING PHARAMOND,"Still following and changing, with nothing forgotten;"
9813,KING PHARAMOND,"For hope of new wonder each morn, when I, waking"
9814,KING PHARAMOND,Behold her awaking eyes turning to seek me;
9815,KING PHARAMOND,For hope of fresh marvels each time the world changing
9816,KING PHARAMOND,Shall show her feet moving in noontide to meet me;
9817,KING PHARAMOND,"For hope of fresh bliss, past all words, half forgotten,"
9818,KING PHARAMOND,When her voice shall break through the hushed blackness of night.
9819,KING PHARAMOND,"--O sweet wind of the summer-tide, broad moon a-whitening,"
9820,KING PHARAMOND,"Bear me witness to Love, and the world he has fashioned!"
9821,KING PHARAMOND,"It shall change, we shall change, as through rain and through sunshine"
9822,KING PHARAMOND,The green rod of the rose-bough to blossoming changeth:
9823,KING PHARAMOND,Still lieth in wait with his sweet tale untold of
9824,KING PHARAMOND,"Each long year of Love, and the first scarce beginneth,"
9825,KING PHARAMOND,"Wherein I have hearkened to the word God hath whispered,"
9826,KING PHARAMOND,Why the fair world was fashioned mid wonders uncounted.
9827,KING PHARAMOND,"Breathe soft, O sweet wind, for surely she speaketh:"
9828,KING PHARAMOND,"_Weary I wax, and my life is a-waning;"
9829,KING PHARAMOND,"Life lapseth fast, and I faint for thee, Pharamond,_"
9830,KING PHARAMOND,_What are thou lacking if Love no more sufficeth?_
9831,KING PHARAMOND,"--Weary not, sweet, as I weary to meet thee;"
9832,KING PHARAMOND,Look not on the long way but my eyes that were weeping
9833,KING PHARAMOND,Faint not in love as thy Pharamond fainteth!--
9834,KING PHARAMOND,"--Yea, Love were enough if thy lips were not lacking."

9950,LOVE,"The weak one's weakness was enough to save,"
9951,LOVE,Let the world hide it in his honour's grave!
9952,LOVE,"For whatso folly is, or wisdom was"
9953,LOVE,Across my threshold naked all must pass.
9954,LOVE,
9955,LOVE,Fear not; no vessel to dishonour born
9956,LOVE,Is in my house; there all shall well adorn
9957,LOVE,The walls whose stones the lapse of Time has laid.
9958,LOVE,Behold again; this life great stories made;
9959,LOVE,"All cast aside for love, and then and then"
9960,LOVE,"Love filched away; the world an adder-den,"
9961,LOVE,"And all folk foes: and one, the one desire--"
9962,LOVE,"--How shall we name it?--grown a poisoned fire,"
9963,LOVE,"God once, God still, but God of wrong and shame"
9964,LOVE,"A lying God, a curse without a name."
9965,LOVE,"So turneth love to hate, the wise world saith."
9966,LOVE,"--Folly--I say 'twixt love and hate lies death,"
9967,LOVE,"They shall not mingle: neither died this love,"
9968,LOVE,But through a dreadful world all changed must move
9969,LOVE,"With earthly death and wrong, and earthly woe"
9970,LOVE,The only deeds its hand might find to do.
9971,LOVE,Surely ye deem that this one shall abide
9972,LOVE,Within the murmuring palace of my pride.
9973,LOVE,
9974,LOVE,"But lo another, how shall he have praise?"
9975,LOVE,Through flame and thorns I led him many days
9976,LOVE,"And nought he shrank, but smiled and followed close,"
9977,LOVE,Till in his path the shade of hate arose
9978,LOVE,'Twixt him and his desire: with heart that burned
9979,LOVE,"For very love back through the thorns he turned,"
9980,LOVE,"His wounds, his tears, his prayers without avail"
9981,LOVE,"Forgotten now, nor e'en for him a tale;"
9982,LOVE,Because for love's sake love he cast aside.
9983,LOVE,"--Lo, saith the World, a heart well satisfied"
9984,LOVE,"With what I give, a barren love forgot--"
9985,LOVE,"--Draw near me, O my child, and heed them not!"
9986,LOVE,"The world thou lovest, e'en my world it is,"
9987,LOVE,"Thy faithful hands yet reach out for my bliss,"
9988,LOVE,Thou seest me in the night and in the day
9989,LOVE,Thou canst not deem that I can go astray.
9990,LOVE,
9991,LOVE,"No further, saith the world 'twixt Heaven and Hell"
9992,LOVE,"Than 'twixt these twain.--My faithful, heed it well!"
9993,LOVE,For on the great day when the hosts are met
9994,LOVE,"On Armageddon's plain by spears beset,"
9995,LOVE,"This is my banner with my sign thereon,"
9996,LOVE,That is my sword wherewith my deeds are done.
9997,LOVE,But how shall tongue of man tell all the tale
9998,LOVE,"Of faithful hearts who overcome or fail,"
9999,LOVE,But at the last fail nowise to be mine.
10000,LOVE,In diverse ways they drink the fateful wine
10001,LOVE,Those twain drank mid the lulling of the storm
10002,LOVE,"Upon the Irish Sea, when love grown warm"
10003,LOVE,"Kindled and blazed, and lit the days to come,"
10004,LOVE,The hope and joy and death that led them home.
10005,LOVE,"--In diverse ways; yet having drunk, be sure"
10006,LOVE,"The flame thus lighted ever shall endure,"
10007,LOVE,So my feet trod the grapes whereby it glowed.
10008,LOVE,
10009,LOVE,"Lo, Faithful, lo, the door of my abode"
10010,LOVE,"Wide open now, and many pressing in"
10011,LOVE,That they the lordship of the World may win!
10012,LOVE,"Hark to the murmuring round my bannered car,"
10013,LOVE,And gird your weapons to you for the war!
10014,LOVE,For who shall say how soon the day shall be
10015,LOVE,Of that last fight that swalloweth up the sea?
10016,LOVE,"Fear not, be ready! forth the banners go,"
10017,LOVE,And will not turn again till every foe
10018,LOVE,Is overcome as though they had not been.
10019,LOVE,"Then, with your memories ever fresh and green,"
10020,LOVE,Come back within the House of Love to dwell;
10021,LOVE,"For ye--the sorrow that no words might tell,"
10022,LOVE,"Your tears unheeded, and your prayers made nought"
10023,LOVE,"Thus and no otherwise through all have wrought,"
10024,LOVE,"That if, the while ye toiled and sorrowed most"
10025,LOVE,"The sound of your lamenting seemed all lost,"
10026,LOVE,"And from my land no answer came again,"
10027,LOVE,It was because of that your care and pain
10028,LOVE,"A house was building, and your bitter sighs"
10029,LOVE,"Came hither as toil-helping melodies,"
10030,LOVE,And in the mortar of our gem-built wall
10031,LOVE,Your tears were mingled mid the rise and fall
10032,LOVE,Of golden trowels tinkling in the hands
10033,LOVE,Of builders gathered wide from all the lands.--
10034,LOVE,"--Is the house finished? Nay, come help to build"
10035,LOVE,Walls that the sun of sorrow once did gild
10036,LOVE,"Through many a bitter morn and hopeless eve,"
10037,LOVE,That so at last in bliss ye may believe;
10038,LOVE,"Then rest with me, and turn no more to tears,"
10039,LOVE,"For then no more by days and months and years,"
10040,LOVE,"By hours of pain come back, and joy passed o'er"
10041,LOVE,We measure time that was--and is no more.

10376,JOAN,"Yea, full fain would I rest thereby,"
10377,JOAN,And watch the flickering martins fly
10378,JOAN,About the long eave-bottles red
10379,JOAN,And the clouds lessening overhead:
10380,JOAN,E'en now meseems the cows are come
10381,JOAN,"Unto the grey gates of our home,"
10382,JOAN,And low to hear the milking-pail:
10383,JOAN,The peacock spreads abroad his tail
10384,JOAN,"Against the sun, as down the lane"
10385,JOAN,"The milkmaids pass the moveless wain,"
10386,JOAN,"And stable door, where the roan team"
10387,JOAN,An hour agone began to dream
10388,JOAN,Over the dusty oats.--
10389,JOAN,"Come, love,"
10390,JOAN,Noises of river and of grove
10391,JOAN,And moving things in field and stall
10392,JOAN,And night-birds' whistle shall be all
10393,JOAN,Of the world's speech that we shall hear
10394,JOAN,By then we come the garth anear:
10395,JOAN,For then the moon that hangs aloft
10396,JOAN,"These thronged streets, lightless now and soft,"
10397,JOAN,"Unnoted, yea, e'en like a shred"
10398,JOAN,"Of yon wide white cloud overhead,"
10399,JOAN,Sharp in the dark star-sprinkled sky
10400,JOAN,Low o'er the willow boughs shall lie;
10401,JOAN,And when our chamber we shall gain
10402,JOAN,Eastward our drowsy eyes shall strain
10403,JOAN,If yet perchance the dawn may show.
10404,JOAN,"--O Love, go with us as we go,"
10405,JOAN,And from the might of thy fair hand
10406,JOAN,Cast wide about the blooming land
10407,JOAN,The seed of such-like tales as this!
10408,JOAN,"--O Day, change round about our bliss,"
10409,JOAN,"Come, restful night, when day is done!"
10410,JOAN,"Come, dawn, and bring a fairer one!"
