21,,Witch-Burning

23,,By MARY ELIZABETH COUNSELMAN

26,,They burned a witch in Bingham Square
27,,Last Friday afternoon.
28,,The faggot-smoke was blacker than
29,,The shadows on the moon;
30,,The licking flames were strangely green
31,,Like fox-fire on the fen ...
32,,And she who cursed the godly folk
33,,Will never curse again.
34,,
35,,They burned a witch in Bingham Square
36,,Before the village gate.
37,,A huswife raised a skinny hand
38,,"To damn her, tense with hate."
39,,A huckster threw a jagged stone--
40,,Her pallid cheek ran red ...
41,,But there was something scornful in
42,,The way she held her head.
43,,
44,,They burned a witch in Bingham Square;
45,,Her eyes were terror-wild.
46,,"She was a slight, a comely maid,"
47,,No taller than a child.
48,,They bound her fast against the stake
49,,And laughed to see her fear ...
50,,Her red lips muttered secret words
51,,That no one dared to hear.
52,,
53,,They burned a witch in Bingham Square--
54,,But ere she swooned with pain
55,,And ere her bones were sodden ash
56,,"Beneath the sudden rain,"
57,,She set her mark upon that throng ...
58,,For time can not erase
59,,"The echo of her anguished cries,"
60,,The memory of her face.
