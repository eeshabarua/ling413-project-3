217,THE LORD OF MISRULE,
218,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Come up, come in with streamers!"
219,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Come in, with boughs of may!"
220,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Come up and thump the sexton,"
221,THE LORD OF MISRULE,And carry the clerk away.
222,THE LORD OF MISRULE,
223,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Now skip like rams, ye mountains,"
224,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Ye little hills, like sheep!"
225,THE LORD OF MISRULE,Come up and wake the people
226,THE LORD OF MISRULE,That parson puts to sleep.
227,THE LORD OF MISRULE,
228,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"They tickled their nut-brown tabors. Their garlands flew in showers,"
229,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"And lasses and lads came after them, with feet like dancing flowers."
230,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Their queen had torn her green gown, and bared a shoulder as white,"
231,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"O, white as the may that crowned her,"
232,THE LORD OF MISRULE,While all the minstrels round her
233,THE LORD OF MISRULE,Tilted back their crimson hats and sang for sheer delight:
234,THE LORD OF MISRULE,
235,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Come up, come in with streamers!"
236,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Come in, with boughs of may!"
237,THE LORD OF MISRULE,Now by the gold upon your toe
238,THE LORD OF MISRULE,You walked the primrose way.
239,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Come up, with white and crimson!"
240,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"O, shake your bells and sing;"
241,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Let the porch bend, the pillars bow,"
242,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Before our Lord, the Spring!"
243,THE LORD OF MISRULE,
244,THE LORD OF MISRULE,The dusty velvet hassocks were dabbled with fragrant dew.
245,THE LORD OF MISRULE,The font grew white with hawthorn. It frothed in every pew.
246,THE LORD OF MISRULE,Three petals clung to the sexton's beard as he mopped and mowed at the
247,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"clerk,"
248,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"And ""Take that sexton away,"" they cried;"
249,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"""Did Nebuchadnezzar eat may?"" they cried."
250,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"""Nay, that was a prize from Betty,"" they cried, ""for kissing her in the"

255,THE LORD OF MISRULE,Who knows but old Methuselah
256,THE LORD OF MISRULE,May hobble the green-wood way?
257,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"If Betty could kiss the sexton,"
258,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"If Kitty could kiss the clerk,"
259,THE LORD OF MISRULE,Who knows how Parson Primrose
260,THE LORD OF MISRULE,Might blossom in the dark?
261,THE LORD OF MISRULE,
262,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"The congregation spluttered. The squire grew purple and all,"
263,THE LORD OF MISRULE,And every little chorister bestrode his carven stall.
264,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"The parson flapped like a magpie, but none could hear his prayers;"
265,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"For Tom Fool flourished his tabor,"
266,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Flourished his nut-brown tabor,"
267,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Bashed the head of the sexton, and stormed the pulpit stairs."
268,THE LORD OF MISRULE,
269,THE LORD OF MISRULE,High in the old oak pulpit
270,THE LORD OF MISRULE,This Lord of all misrule--
271,THE LORD OF MISRULE,I think it was Will Summers
272,THE LORD OF MISRULE,That once was Shakespeare's fool--
273,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Held up his hand for silence,"
274,THE LORD OF MISRULE,And all the church grew still:
275,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"""And are you snoring yet,"" he said,"
276,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"""Or have you slept your fill?"
277,THE LORD OF MISRULE,
278,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"""Your God still walks in Eden, between the ancient trees,"
279,THE LORD OF MISRULE,Where Youth and Love go wading through pools of primroses.
280,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"And this is the sign we bring you, before the darkness fall,"
281,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"That Spring is risen, is risen again,"
282,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"That Life is risen, is risen again,"
283,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"That Love is risen, is risen again, and Love is Lord of all."
284,THE LORD OF MISRULE,
285,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"""At Paske began our morrice"
286,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"And, ere Pentecost, our May;"
287,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Because, albeit your words be true,"
288,THE LORD OF MISRULE,You know not what you say.
289,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"You chatter in church like jackdaws,"
290,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Words that would wake the dead,"
291,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Were there one breath of life in you,"
292,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"One drop of blood,"" he said."
293,THE LORD OF MISRULE,
294,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"""_He died and He went down to hell!_ You know not what you mean."
295,THE LORD OF MISRULE,Our rafters were of green fir. Also our beds were green.
296,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"But out of the mouth of a fool, a fool, before the darkness fall,"
297,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"We tell you He is risen again,"
298,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"The Lord of Life is risen again,"
299,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"The boughs put forth their tender buds, and Love is Lord of all!"""
300,THE LORD OF MISRULE,
301,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"He bowed his head. He stood so still,"
302,THE LORD OF MISRULE,They bowed their heads as well.
303,THE LORD OF MISRULE,And softly from the organ-loft
304,THE LORD OF MISRULE,The song began to swell.
305,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"_Come up with blood-red streamers_,"
306,THE LORD OF MISRULE,The reeds began the strain.
307,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"The _vox humana_ pealed on high,"
308,THE LORD OF MISRULE,_The Spring is risen again!_
309,THE LORD OF MISRULE,
310,THE LORD OF MISRULE,The _vox angelica_ replied--_The shadows flee away!
311,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"Our house-beams were of cedar. Come in, with boughs of may!_"
312,THE LORD OF MISRULE,"The _diapason_ deepened it--_Before the darkness fall_,"
313,THE LORD OF MISRULE,_We tell you He is risen again!

660,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,
661,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"All his tunes are dead and gone, dead as yesterday."
662,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,And his lanthorn flits no more
663,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Round the _Devil Tavern_ door,"
664,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Waiting till the gallants come, singing from the play;"
665,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Waiting in the wet and cold!
666,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,All his Whitsun tales are told.
667,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"He is dead and gone, sirs, very far away."
668,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,
669,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,He would not give a silver groat
670,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,For good or evil weather.
671,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,He carried in his white cap
672,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,A long red feather.
673,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,He wore a long coat
674,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Of the Reading-tawny kind,"
675,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,And darned white hosen
676,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,With a blue patch behind.
677,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,
678,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"So--one night--he shuffled past, in his buckled shoon."
679,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"We shall never see his face,"
680,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Twisted to that queer grimace,"
681,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Waiting in the wind and rain, till we called his tune;"
682,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Very whimsical and white,"
683,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Waiting on a blue Twelfth Night!
684,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,He is grown too proud at last--old blind Moone.
685,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,
686,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Yet, when May was at the door,"
687,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"And Moone was wont to sing,"
688,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Many a maid and bachelor
689,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Whirled into the ring:
690,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Standing on a tilted wain
691,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,He played so sweet and loud
692,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,The Mayor forgot his golden chain
693,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,And jigged it with the crowd.
694,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,
695,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Old blind Moone, his fiddle scattered flowers along the street;"
696,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Into the dust of Brookfield Fair
697,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Carried a shining primrose air,"
698,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Crooning like a poor mad maid, O, very low and sweet,"
699,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Drew us close, and held us bound,"
700,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Then--to the tune of _Pedlar's Pound_,"
701,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Caught us up, and whirled us round, a thousand frolic feet."
702,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,
703,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Master Shakespeare was his host.
704,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,The tribe of Benjamin
705,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Used to call him Merlin's Ghost
706,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,At the _Mermaid Inn_.
707,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"He was only a crowder,"
708,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Fiddling at the door.
709,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Death has made him prouder.
710,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,We shall not see him more.
711,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,
712,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Only--if you listen, please--through the master's themes,"
713,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"You shall hear a wizard strain,"
714,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Blind and bright as wind and rain
715,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Shaken out of willow-trees, and shot with elfin gleams."
716,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,_How should I your true love know?_
717,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Scraps and snatches--even so!
718,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"That is old blind Moone again, fiddling in your dreams."
719,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,
720,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Once, when Will had called for sack"
721,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"And bidden him up and play,"
722,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Old blind Moone, he turned his back,"
723,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Growled, and walked away,"
724,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Sailed into a thunder-cloud,"
725,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Snapped his fiddle-string,"
726,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,And hobbled from _The Mermaid_
727,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Sulky as a king.
728,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,
729,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Only from the darkness now, steals the strain we knew:"
730,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,No one even knows his grave!
731,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Only here and there a stave,"
732,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Out of all his hedge-row flock, be-drips the may with dew."
733,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,And I know not what wild bird
734,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Carried us his parting word:--
735,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"_Master Shakespeare needn't take the crowder's fiddle, too._"
736,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,
737,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Will has wealth and wealth to spare.
738,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Give him back his own.
739,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"_At his head a grass-green turf,"
740,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,At his heels a stone._
741,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,See his little lanthorn-spark.
742,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Hear his ghostly tune,"
743,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Glimmering past you, in the dark,"
744,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Old blind Moone!
745,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,
746,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"All the little crazy brooks, where love and sorrow run"
747,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Crowned with sedge and singing wild,"
748,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,Like a sky-lark--or a child!--
749,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Old blind Moone, he knew their springs, and played 'em every one;"
750,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Stood there, in the darkness, blind,"
751,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,And sang them into Shakespeare's mind....
752,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"Old blind Moone of London, O now his songs are done,"
753,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"The light upon his lost white face, they say it was the sun!"
754,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,
755,BLIND MOONE OF LONDON,"The light upon his poor old face, they say it was the sun!"

761,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,
762,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,
763,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,"A great while ago, there was a school-boy."
764,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,He lived in a cottage by the sea.
765,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,And the very first thing he could remember
766,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,Was the rigging of the schooners by the quay.
767,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,
768,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,"He could watch them, when he woke, from his window,"
769,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,With the tall cranes hoisting out the freight.
770,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,"And he used to think of shipping as a sea-cook,"
771,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,And sailing to the Golden Gate.
772,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,
773,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,"For he used to buy the yellow penny dreadfuls,"
774,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,"And read them where he fished for conger eels,"
775,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,"And listened to the lapping of the water,"
776,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,The green and oily water round the keels.
777,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,
778,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,"There were trawlers with their shark-mouthed flat-fish,"
779,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,"And red nets hanging out to dry,"
780,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,"And the skate the skipper kept because he liked 'em,"
781,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,And landsmen never knew the fish to fry.
782,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,
783,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,"There were brigantines with timber out of Norroway,"
784,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,Oozing with the syrups of the pine.
785,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,"There were rusty dusty schooners out of Sunderland,"
786,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,And ships of the Blue Cross line.
787,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,
788,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,And to tumble down a hatch into the cabin
789,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,Was better than the best of broken rules;
790,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,"For the smell of 'em was like a Christmas dinner,"
791,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,And the feel of 'em was like a box of tools.
792,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,
793,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,"And, before he went to sleep in the evening,"
794,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,The very last thing that he could see
795,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,Was the sailor-men a-dancing in the moonlight
796,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,By the capstan that stood upon the quay.
797,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,
798,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,_He is perched upon a high stool in London.
799,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,The Golden Gate is very far away.
800,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,"They caught him, and they caged him, like a squirrel."
801,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,"He is totting up accounts, and going grey._"
802,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,
803,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,"_He will never, never, never sail to 'Frisco."
804,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,But the very last thing that he will see
805,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,Will be sailor-men a-dancing in the sunrise
806,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,By the capstan that stands upon the quay...._
807,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,
808,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,"_To the tune of an old concertina,"
809,OLD GREY SQUIRREL,By the capstan that stands upon the quay._

830,THE GREAT NORTH ROAD,Bright as Jack-o'-Lanthorns off the great North Road.
831,THE GREAT NORTH ROAD,
832,THE GREAT NORTH ROAD,Tales were told in country inns when Turpin rode to Rippleside!

835,THE GREAT NORTH ROAD,The gay Golden Farmer and the Hereford Boy.
836,THE GREAT NORTH ROAD,
837,THE GREAT NORTH ROAD,What are you seeking then? I asked this honest pedlar.
838,THE GREAT NORTH ROAD,"--O, Mulled Sack or Natty Hawes might ease me of my load!--"
839,THE GREAT NORTH ROAD,Where are they flown then?--Flown where I follow;
840,THE GREAT NORTH ROAD,They are all gone for ever up the great North Road.

852,THE RIVER OF STARS,(_A tale of Niagara_)
853,THE RIVER OF STARS,
854,THE RIVER OF STARS,
855,THE RIVER OF STARS,_The lights of a hundred cities are fed by its midnight power.
856,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Their wheels are moved by its thunder. But they, too, have their hour."
857,THE RIVER OF STARS,"The tale of the Indian lovers, a cry from the years that are flown,"
858,THE RIVER OF STARS,"While the river of stars is rolling,"
859,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Rolling away to the darkness,"
860,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Abides with the power in the midnight, where love may find its own._"
861,THE RIVER OF STARS,
862,THE RIVER OF STARS,"She watched from the Huron tents, till the first star shook in the air."
863,THE RIVER OF STARS,"The sweet pine scented her fawn-skins, and breathed from her braided"
864,THE RIVER OF STARS,hair.
865,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Her crown was of milk-white blood-root, because of the tryst she would"
866,THE RIVER OF STARS,"keep,"
867,THE RIVER OF STARS,Beyond the river of beauty
868,THE RIVER OF STARS,That drifted away in the darkness
869,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Drawing the sunset thro' lilies, with eyes like stars, to the deep."
870,THE RIVER OF STARS,
871,THE RIVER OF STARS,"He watched, like a tall young wood-god, from the red pine that she"
872,THE RIVER OF STARS,named;
873,THE RIVER OF STARS,"But not for the peril behind him, where the eyes of the Mohawks flamed."
874,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Eagle-plumed he stood. But his heart was hunting afar,"
875,THE RIVER OF STARS,Where the river of longing whispered ...
876,THE RIVER OF STARS,And one swift shaft from the darkness
877,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Felled him, her name in his death-cry, his eyes on the sunset star."
878,THE RIVER OF STARS,
879,THE RIVER OF STARS,*       *       *       *       *
880,THE RIVER OF STARS,
881,THE RIVER OF STARS,She stole from the river and listened. The moon on her wet skin shone.
882,THE RIVER OF STARS,"As a silver birch in a pine-wood, her beauty flashed and was gone."
883,THE RIVER OF STARS,There was no wave in the forest. The dark arms closed her round.
884,THE RIVER OF STARS,"But the river of life went flowing,"
885,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Flowing away to the darkness,"
886,THE RIVER OF STARS,"For her breast grew red with his heart's blood, in a night where the"
887,THE RIVER OF STARS,stars are drowned.
888,THE RIVER OF STARS,
889,THE RIVER OF STARS,"_Teach me, O my lover, as you taught me of love in a day,"
890,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Teach me of death, and for ever, and set my feet on the way,"
891,THE RIVER OF STARS,"To the land of the happy shadows, the land where you are flown._"
892,THE RIVER OF STARS,"--And the river of death went weeping,"
893,THE RIVER OF STARS,Weeping away to the darkness.--
894,THE RIVER OF STARS,"_Is the hunting good, my lover, so good that you hunt alone?_"
895,THE RIVER OF STARS,
896,THE RIVER OF STARS,"She rose to her feet like a shadow. She sent a cry thro' the night,"
897,THE RIVER OF STARS,"_Sa-sa-kuon_, the death-whoop, that tells of triumph in fight."
898,THE RIVER OF STARS,"It broke from the bell of her mouth like the cry of a wounded bird,"
899,THE RIVER OF STARS,But the river of agony swelled it
900,THE RIVER OF STARS,"And swept it along to the darkness,"
901,THE RIVER OF STARS,"And the Mohawks, couched in the darkness, leapt to their feet as they"
902,THE RIVER OF STARS,heard.
903,THE RIVER OF STARS,
904,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Close as the ring of the clouds that menace the moon with death,"
905,THE RIVER OF STARS,At once they circled her round. Her bright breast panted for breath.
906,THE RIVER OF STARS,"With only her own wild glory keeping the wolves at bay,"
907,THE RIVER OF STARS,"While the river of parting whispered,"
908,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Whispered away to the darkness,"
909,THE RIVER OF STARS,"She looked in their eyes for a moment, and strove for a word to say."
910,THE RIVER OF STARS,
911,THE RIVER OF STARS,"_Teach me, O my lover!_--She set her foot on the dead."
912,THE RIVER OF STARS,"She laughed on the painted faces with their rings of yellow and red,--"
913,THE RIVER OF STARS,"_I thank you, wolves of the Mohawk, for a woman's hands might fail._--"
914,THE RIVER OF STARS,"--And the river of vengeance chuckled,"
915,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Chuckled away to the darkness,--"
916,THE RIVER OF STARS,_But ye have killed where I hunted. I have come to the end of my trail._
917,THE RIVER OF STARS,
918,THE RIVER OF STARS,"_I thank you, braves of the Mohawk, who laid this thief at my feet."
919,THE RIVER OF STARS,"He tore my heart out living, and tossed it his dogs to eat."
920,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Ye have taught him of death in a moment, as he taught me of love in a"
921,THE RIVER OF STARS,day._
922,THE RIVER OF STARS,"--And the river of passion deepened,"
923,THE RIVER OF STARS,Deepened and rushed to the darkness.--
924,THE RIVER OF STARS,"_And yet may a woman requite you, and set your feet on the way._"
925,THE RIVER OF STARS,
926,THE RIVER OF STARS,"_For the woman that spits in my face, and the shaven heads that gibe,"
927,THE RIVER OF STARS,This night shall a woman show you the tents of the Huron tribe.
928,THE RIVER OF STARS,They are lodged in a deep valley. With all things good it abounds.
929,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Where the red-eyed, green-mooned river"
930,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Glides like a snake to the darkness,"
931,THE RIVER OF STARS,"I will show you a valley, Mohawks, like the Happy Hunting Grounds._"
932,THE RIVER OF STARS,
933,THE RIVER OF STARS,"_Follow!_ They chuckled, and followed like wolves to the glittering"
934,THE RIVER OF STARS,stream.
935,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Shadows obeying a shadow, they launched their canoes in a dream."
936,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Alone, in the first, with the blood on her breast, and her milk-white"
937,THE RIVER OF STARS,"crown,"
938,THE RIVER OF STARS,"She stood. She smiled at them, _Follow_,"
939,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Then urged her canoe to the darkness,"
940,THE RIVER OF STARS,"And, silently flashing their paddles, the Mohawks followed her down."
941,THE RIVER OF STARS,
942,THE RIVER OF STARS,*       *       *       *       *
943,THE RIVER OF STARS,
944,THE RIVER OF STARS,And now--as they slid thro' the pine-woods with their peaks of midnight
945,THE RIVER OF STARS,"blue,"
946,THE RIVER OF STARS,"She heard, in the broadening distance, the deep sound that she knew,"
947,THE RIVER OF STARS,A mutter of steady thunder that grew as they glanced along;
948,THE RIVER OF STARS,But ever she glanced before them
949,THE RIVER OF STARS,"And glanced away to the darkness,"
950,THE RIVER OF STARS,"And or ever they heard it rightly, she raised her voice in a song:--"
951,THE RIVER OF STARS,
952,THE RIVER OF STARS,"_The wind from the Isles of the Blesséd, it blows across the foam."
953,THE RIVER OF STARS,It sings in the flowing maples of the land that was my home.
954,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Where the moose is a morning's hunt, and the buffalo feeds from the"
955,THE RIVER OF STARS,hand._--
956,THE RIVER OF STARS,"And the river of mockery broadened,"
957,THE RIVER OF STARS,Broadened and rolled to the darkness--
958,THE RIVER OF STARS,"_And the green maize lifts its feathers, and laughs the snow from the"
959,THE RIVER OF STARS,land._
960,THE RIVER OF STARS,
961,THE RIVER OF STARS,The river broadened and quickened. There was nought but river and sky.
962,THE RIVER OF STARS,The shores were lost in the darkness. She laughed and lifted a cry:
963,THE RIVER OF STARS,_Follow me! Sa-sa-kuon!_ Swifter and swifter they swirled--
964,THE RIVER OF STARS,"And the flood of their doom went flying,"
965,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Flying away to the darkness,"
966,THE RIVER OF STARS,"_Follow me, follow me, Mohawks, ye are shooting the edge of the world._"
967,THE RIVER OF STARS,
968,THE RIVER OF STARS,They struggled like snakes to return. Like straws they were whirled on
969,THE RIVER OF STARS,her track.
970,THE RIVER OF STARS,For the whole flood swooped to that edge where the unplumbed night dropt
971,THE RIVER OF STARS,"black,"
972,THE RIVER OF STARS,"The whole flood dropt to a thunder in an unplumbed hell beneath,"
973,THE RIVER OF STARS,And over the gulf of the thunder
974,THE RIVER OF STARS,A mountain of spray from the darkness
975,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Rose and stood in the heavens, like a shrouded image of death."
976,THE RIVER OF STARS,
977,THE RIVER OF STARS,She rushed like a star before them. The moon on her glorying shone.
978,THE RIVER OF STARS,"_Teach me, O my lover_,--her cry flashed out and was gone."
979,THE RIVER OF STARS,A moment they battled behind her. They lashed with their paddles and
980,THE RIVER OF STARS,lunged;
981,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Then the Mohawks, turning their faces"
982,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Like a blood-stained cloud to the darkness,"
983,THE RIVER OF STARS,Over the edge of Niagara swept together and plunged.
984,THE RIVER OF STARS,
985,THE RIVER OF STARS,_And the lights of a hundred cities are fed by the ancient power;
986,THE RIVER OF STARS,"But a cry returns with the midnight; for they, too, have their hour."
987,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Teach me, O my lover, as you taught me of love in a day,"
988,THE RIVER OF STARS,"--While the river of stars is rolling,"
989,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Rolling away to the darkness,--"
990,THE RIVER OF STARS,"Teach me of death, and for ever, and set my feet on the way!_"

1510,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,
1511,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,"That you shall see, on any grave"
1512,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,"The snow fall, like that unseen hand"
1513,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,"Which O, so often, pressed your hair"
1514,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,To cherish and console:
1515,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,That seas may roar and winds rave
1516,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,But you shall feel and understand
1517,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,What vast caresses everywhere
1518,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,Convey you to the goal.

1523,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,And lips that still could sing--
1524,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,"And all around us, in the may,"
1525,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,"The child-god with his laughter ran,"
1526,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,"And every bloom, on every spray,"
1527,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,Betrayed his fluttering wing.
1528,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,

1530,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,"Until the end, until the end."
1531,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,"It is not cruelty, but bliss"
1532,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,That pains and is so fond:
1533,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,"Crush life like thyme beneath your feet,"
1534,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,"And O, my love, when that strange friend,"
1535,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,"The Shadow of Wings, which men call Death"
1536,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,"Shall close your eyes, with that last kiss,"
1537,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,Ask not His name. A rosier breath
1538,THE PSYCHE OF OUR DAY,Shall waken you--beyond.

2754,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"And they stood in a deep window, looking to the west."
2755,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Her white breast was brighter than the moon upon the sea,"
2756,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,And it moved in her agony (because it was the end!)
2757,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Like a deep sea, where many had been drowned."
2758,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,Proud ships that were crowned with an Emperor's eagles
2759,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Were sunken there forgotten, with their emeralds and gold."
2760,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"They had drunken of that glory, and their tale was told, utterly,"
2761,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,Told.
2762,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,
2763,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"There, as they parted, heart from heart, mouth from mouth,"
2764,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,They stared upon each other. They listened.
2765,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,For the South-wind
2766,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Brought them a rumour from afar; and she said,"
2767,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Lifting her head, too beautiful for anguish,"
2768,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Too proud for pity,--"
2769,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"_It is the gods that leave the City! O, Anthony,"
2770,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Anthony, the gods have forsaken us;"
2771,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,Because it is the end! They leave us to our doom.
2772,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Hear it!_ And unshaken in the darkness,"
2773,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Dull as dropping earth upon a tomb in the distance,"
2774,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"They heard, as when across a wood a low wind comes,"
2775,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"A muttering of drums, drawing nearer,"
2776,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Then louder and clearer, as when a trumpet sings"
2777,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"To battle, it came rushing on the wings of the wind,"
2778,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"A sound of sacked cities, a sound of lamentation,"
2779,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"A cry of desolation, as when a conquered nation"
2780,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Is weeping in the darkness, because its tale is told;"
2781,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,And then--a sound of chariots that rolled thro' that sorrow
2782,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Trampled like a storm of wild stallions, tossing nearer,"
2783,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Trampled louder, clearer, triumphantly as music,"
2784,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Till lo! in that great darkness, along that vacant street,"
2785,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"A red light beat like a furnace on the walls,"
2786,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Then--like the blast when the North-wind calls to battle,"
2787,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Blaring thro' the blood-red tumult and the flame,"
2788,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Shaking the proud City as they came, an hundred elephants,"
2789,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Cream-white and bronze, and splashed with bitter crimson,"
2790,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Trumpeting for battle as they trod, an hundred elephants,"
2791,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Bronze and cream-white, and trapped with gold and purple,"
2792,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Towered like tuskéd castles, every thunder-laden footfall"
2793,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Dreadful as the shattering of a City. Yet they trod,"
2794,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Rocking like an earthquake, to a great triumphant music,"
2795,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"And, swinging like the stars, black planets, white moons,"
2796,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Thro' the stream of the torches, they brought the red chariot,"
2797,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,The chariot of the battle-god--Mars.
2798,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"While the tall spears of Sparta tossed clashing in his train,"
2799,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,And a host of ghostly warriors cried aloud
2800,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"_All hail!_ to those twain, and went rushing to the darkness"
2801,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Like a pageantry of cloud, for their tale was told--utterly--"
2802,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,Told.
2803,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,
2804,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"And following, in the fury of the vine, rushing down"
2805,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Like a many-visaged torrent, with ivy-rod and thyrse,"
2806,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"And many a wild and foaming crown of roses,"
2807,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Crowded the Bacchanals, the brown-limbed shepherds,"
2808,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"The red-tongued leopards, and the glory of the god!"
2809,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"_Iacchus! Iacchus!_ without dance, without song,"
2810,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,They cried and swept along to the darkness.
2811,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,Only for a breath when the tumult of their torches
2812,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,Crimsoned the deep window where that dark warrior stood
2813,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"With the blood upon his mail, and the Queen--Cleopatra,"
2814,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Frozen to white marble--the Mænads raised their timbrels,"
2815,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Tossed their white arms, with a clash--_All hail!_"
2816,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Like wild swimmers, pale, in a sea of blood and wine,"
2817,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,_All hail! All hail!_ Then they swept into the darkness
2818,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,And the darkness buried them. Their tale was told--utterly--
2819,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,Told.
2820,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,
2821,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"And following them, O softer than the moon upon the sea,"
2822,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Aphrodite, implacably, shone."
2823,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Like a furnace of white roses, Aphrodite and her train"
2824,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,Lifted their white arms to those twain in the silence
2825,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Once, and were gone into the darkness;"
2826,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Once, and away into the darkness they were swept"
2827,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Like a pageantry of cloud, without praise, without pity."
2828,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,Then the dark City slept. And the Queen--Cleopatra--
2829,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Subtlest of women that this earth has ever seen,"
2830,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Turning to her lover in the darkness where he stood,"
2831,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"With the blood upon his mail,"
2832,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,"Bowing her head upon that iron in the darkness,"
2833,THE INIMITABLE LOVERS,Wept.

2848,THE CRAGS,"Where, founded on a rock, your house"
2849,THE CRAGS,Between the pines' unfading boughs
2850,THE CRAGS,Watches through sun and rain

2854,THE CRAGS,"Breaks on your crags the summer through,"
2855,THE CRAGS,"A long pine's length below,"
2856,THE CRAGS,In rainbow-tossing snow.
2857,THE CRAGS,
2858,THE CRAGS,While on your railed verandah there
2859,THE CRAGS,"As on a deck you sail through air,"

2880,THE CRAGS,"Across the whispering sea,"
2881,THE CRAGS,A road--for memory.
2882,THE CRAGS,
2883,THE CRAGS,"When the blue dusk has filled the pane,"
2884,THE CRAGS,"And the great pine-logs burn again,"

2886,THE CRAGS,--For his were books indeed.--
2887,THE CRAGS,
2888,THE CRAGS,"Their silken shadows, rustling, dim,"
2889,THE CRAGS,May sing no more of Spain for him;
2890,THE CRAGS,No shadows of old France
2891,THE CRAGS,Renew their courtly dance.
2892,THE CRAGS,
2893,THE CRAGS,He walks no more where shadows are
2894,THE CRAGS,"But left their ivory gates ajar,"
2895,THE CRAGS,That shadows might prolong
2896,THE CRAGS,"The dance, the tale, the song."
2897,THE CRAGS,
2898,THE CRAGS,His was no narrow test or rule.
2899,THE CRAGS,"He chose the best of every school,--"
2900,THE CRAGS,"Stendhal and Keats and Donne,"
2901,THE CRAGS,Balzac and Stevenson;
2902,THE CRAGS,
2903,THE CRAGS,Wordsworth and Flaubert filled their place.
2904,THE CRAGS,Dumas met Hawthorne face to face.
2905,THE CRAGS,There were both new and old
2906,THE CRAGS,In his good realm of gold.
2907,THE CRAGS,
2908,THE CRAGS,The title-pages bore his name;
2909,THE CRAGS,"And, nightly, by the dancing flame,"
2910,THE CRAGS,"Following him, I found"
2911,THE CRAGS,That all was haunted ground;
2912,THE CRAGS,

3147,THE OUTLAW,My wild hounds race.
3148,THE OUTLAW,"I cloak my soul at feast and mart,"
3149,THE OUTLAW,I mask my face;
3150,THE OUTLAW,
3151,THE OUTLAW,"Outlawed, but not alone, for Truth"
3152,THE OUTLAW,"Is outlawed, too."
3153,THE OUTLAW,"Proud world, you cannot banish us."
3154,THE OUTLAW,_We_ banish _you_.
3155,THE OUTLAW,
3156,THE OUTLAW,"Go by, go by, with all your din,"
3157,THE OUTLAW,"Your dust, your greed, your guile,"
3158,THE OUTLAW,"Your gold, your thrones can never win--"
3159,THE OUTLAW,From Her--one smile.
3160,THE OUTLAW,
3161,THE OUTLAW,"She sings to me in a lonely place,"
3162,THE OUTLAW,She takes my hand.
3163,THE OUTLAW,I look into her lovely face
3164,THE OUTLAW,And understand....
3165,THE OUTLAW,
3166,THE OUTLAW,"Outlawed, but not alone, for Love"
3167,THE OUTLAW,"Is outlawed, too."
3168,THE OUTLAW,"You cannot banish us, proud world."
3169,THE OUTLAW,_We_ banish _you_.
3170,THE OUTLAW,
3171,THE OUTLAW,"Now which is outlawed, which alone?"
3172,THE OUTLAW,Around us fall and rise
3173,THE OUTLAW,"Murmurs of leaf and fern, the moan"
3174,THE OUTLAW,Of Paradise.
3175,THE OUTLAW,
3176,THE OUTLAW,Outlawed? Then hills and woods and streams
3177,THE OUTLAW,"Are outlawed, too!"
3178,THE OUTLAW,"Proud world, from our immortal dreams,"
3179,THE OUTLAW,We banish you.

3184,THE YOUNG FRIAR,THE YOUNG FRIAR
3185,THE YOUNG FRIAR,
3186,THE YOUNG FRIAR,
3187,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"When leaves broke out on the wild briar,"
3188,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"And bells for matins rung,"
3189,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Sorrow came to the old friar
3190,THE YOUNG FRIAR,--Hundreds of years ago it was!--
3191,THE YOUNG FRIAR,And May came to the young.
3192,THE YOUNG FRIAR,
3193,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"The old was ripening for the sky,"
3194,THE YOUNG FRIAR,The young was twenty-four.
3195,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"The Franklin's daughter passed him by,"
3196,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"Reading a painted missal-book,"
3197,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Beside the chapel door.
3198,THE YOUNG FRIAR,
3199,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"With brown cassock and sandalled feet,"
3200,THE YOUNG FRIAR,And red Spring wine for blood;
3201,THE YOUNG FRIAR,The very next noon he chanced to meet
3202,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"The Franklin's daughter, in a green May twilight,"
3203,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Walking through the wood.
3204,THE YOUNG FRIAR,
3205,THE YOUNG FRIAR,_Pax vobiscum_--to a maid
3206,THE YOUNG FRIAR,The crosiered ferns among!
3207,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"But hers was only the Saxon,"
3208,THE YOUNG FRIAR,And his the Norman tongue;
3209,THE YOUNG FRIAR,And the Latin taught by the old friar
3210,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Made music for the young.
3211,THE YOUNG FRIAR,
3212,THE YOUNG FRIAR,And never a better deed was done
3213,THE YOUNG FRIAR,By Mother Church below
3214,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"Than when she made old England one,"
3215,THE YOUNG FRIAR,--Hundreds of years ago it was!--
3216,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Hundreds of years ago.
3217,THE YOUNG FRIAR,
3218,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Rich was the painted page they read
3219,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Before that sunset died;
3220,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"Nut-brown hood by golden head,"
3221,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"Murmuring _Rosa Mystica_,"
3222,THE YOUNG FRIAR,While nesting thrushes cried.
3223,THE YOUNG FRIAR,
3224,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"A Saxon maid with flaxen hair,"
3225,THE YOUNG FRIAR,And eyes of Sussex grey;
3226,THE YOUNG FRIAR,A young monk out of Normandy:--
3227,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"""May is our Lady's month,"" he said,"
3228,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"""And O, my love, my May!"""
3229,THE YOUNG FRIAR,
3230,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Then over the fallen missal-book
3231,THE YOUNG FRIAR,The missel-thrushes sung
3232,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Till--_Domus Aurea_--rose the moon
3233,THE YOUNG FRIAR,And bells for vespers rung.
3234,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"It was gold and blue for the old friar,"
3235,THE YOUNG FRIAR,But hawthorn for the young.
3236,THE YOUNG FRIAR,
3237,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"For gown of green and brown hood,"
3238,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"Before that curfew tolled,"
3239,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Had flown for ever through the wood
3240,THE YOUNG FRIAR,--Hundreds of years ago it was!--
3241,THE YOUNG FRIAR,But twenty summers old.
3242,THE YOUNG FRIAR,
3243,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"And empty stood his chapel stall,"
3244,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"Empty his thin grey cell,"
3245,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Empty her seat in the Franklin's hall;
3246,THE YOUNG FRIAR,And there were swords that searched for them
3247,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Before the matin bell.
3248,THE YOUNG FRIAR,
3249,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"And, crowders tell, a sword that night"
3250,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"Wrought them an evil turn,"
3251,THE YOUNG FRIAR,And that the may was not more white
3252,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Than those white bones the robin found
3253,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Among the roots of fern.
3254,THE YOUNG FRIAR,
3255,THE YOUNG FRIAR,But others tell of stranger things
3256,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"Half-heard on Whitsun eves,"
3257,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Of sweet and ghostly whisperings--
3258,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Though hundreds of years ago it was--
3259,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Among the ghostly leaves:--
3260,THE YOUNG FRIAR,
3261,THE YOUNG FRIAR,_Sero te amavi_--
3262,THE YOUNG FRIAR,Grey eyes of sun-lit dew!--
3263,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"_Tam antiqua, Tam nova_--"
3264,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"Augustine heard it, too."
3265,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"Late have I loved that May, Lady,"
3266,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"So ancient, and so new!"
3267,THE YOUNG FRIAR,
3268,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"And no man knows where they were flown,"
3269,THE YOUNG FRIAR,For the wind takes the may:
3270,THE YOUNG FRIAR,But white and fresh the may was blown
3271,THE YOUNG FRIAR,--Though hundreds of years ago it was--
3272,THE YOUNG FRIAR,As this that blooms to-day.
3273,THE YOUNG FRIAR,
3274,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"And the leaves break out on the wild briar,"
3275,THE YOUNG FRIAR,And bells must still be rung;
3276,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"But sorrow comes to the old friar,"
3277,THE YOUNG FRIAR,"For he remembers a May, a May,"
3278,THE YOUNG FRIAR,When his old heart was young.

3320,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Tortured with moans of butchered innocents,"
3321,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Blow past us on the wind. Chaos resumes
3322,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"His kingdom. All the visions of the world,"
3323,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"The visions that were music, being shaped"
3324,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"By law, moving in measure, treading the road"
3325,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"That suns and systems tread, O who can hear"
3326,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Their music now? Urania bows her head.
3327,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Only the feet that move in order dance.
3328,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Only the mind attuned to that dread pulse
3329,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Of law throughout the universe can sing.
3330,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Only the soul that plays its rhythmic part

3343,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Our discords, and to this, to this attuned,"
3344,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Though blindly, it responds, in notes like these:"
3345,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,
3346,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"There was a song in heaven of old,"
3347,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"A song the choral seven began,"
3348,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,When God with all his chariots rolled

3383,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Unreckoned seems our human cry,"
3384,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"In Thy deep law, beyond the years,"
3385,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Abides the Eternal memory.
3386,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Thy law is light, to eyes grown dull"
3387,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Dreaming of worlds like bubbles blown;

3401,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"The boughs put forth, the young leaves groped for light."
3402,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,The wild flower spread its petals as in prayer.
3403,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Then, for terrestrial ears, vast discords rose,"
3404,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"The struggle in the jungle, clashing themes"
3405,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"That strove for mastery; but above them all,"
3406,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Ever the mightier measure of the suns
3407,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Resolved them into broader harmonies,"
3408,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,That fought again for mastery. The night
3409,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Buried the mastodon. The warring tribes
3410,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Of men were merged in nations. Wider laws
3411,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Embraced them. Man no longer fought with man,"
3412,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Though nation warred with nation. Hatred fell
3413,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Before the gaze of love. For in an hour
3414,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"When, by the law of might, mankind could rise"
3415,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"No higher, into the deepening music stole"
3416,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"A loftier theme, a law that gathered all"
3417,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,The laws of earth into its broadening breast
3418,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"And moved like one full river to the sea,"
3419,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,The law of Love.
3420,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,The sun stood dark at noon;
3421,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Dark as the moon before this mightier Power,"
3422,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,And a Voice rang across the blood-stained earth:
3423,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"_I am the Way, the Truth, the Life, the Light._"
3424,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"We heard it, and we did not hear. In dreams"
3425,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"We caught a thousand fragments of the strain,"
3426,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,But never wholly heard it. We moved on
3427,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Obeying it a little, till our world"
3428,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Became so vast, that we could only hear"
3429,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Stray notes, a golden phrase, a sorrowful cry,"
3430,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Never the rounded glory of the whole.
3431,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"So one would sing of death, one of despair,"
3432,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"And some, knowing that God was more than man,"
3433,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Knowing that the Eternal Power behind
3434,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Our universe was more than man, would shrink"
3435,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"From crowning Him with human attributes,"
3436,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Though these remained the highest that we knew;
3437,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"And therefore, falling back on lower signs,"
3438,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Bereft of love, thought, personality,"
3439,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,They made Him less than man; made Him a blind
3440,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Unweeting force, less than the best in man,"
3441,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Less than the best that He Himself had made.
3442,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,
3443,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Yet, though from earth we could no longer hear"
3444,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"As from a central throne, the harmonies"
3445,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Of the revolving whole; yet though from earth,"
3446,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"And from earth's Calvary, the central scene"
3447,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Withdrew to dreadful depths beyond our ken;
3448,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Withdrew to some deep Calvary at the heart
3449,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Of all creation; yet, O yet, we heard,"
3450,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Echoes that murmured from Eternity,"
3451,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"_I am the Way, the Truth, the Life, the Light._"
3452,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,And still the eternal passion undiscerned
3453,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Moved like a purple shadow through our world,"
3454,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"While we, in intellectual chaos, raised"
3455,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"The ancient cry, _Not this man, but Barabbas._"
3456,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Then Might grew Right once more, for who could hold"
3457,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"The Right, when the rebellious hearts of men"
3458,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Finding the Law too hard in life, thought, art,"
3459,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Proclaimed that Right itself was born of chance,"
3460,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Born out of nothingness and doomed, at last,"
3461,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,To nothingness; while all that men have held
3462,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Better than dust--love, honour, justice, truth--"
3463,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Was less than dust, for the blind dust endures?"
3464,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"But love, they said, and the proud soul of man,"
3465,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Die with the breath, before the flesh decays."
3466,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"And still, amidst the chaos, Love was born,"
3467,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Suffered and died; and in a myriad forms
3468,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,A myriad parables of the Eternal Christ
3469,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Unfolded their deep message to mankind.
3470,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"So, on this last wild winter of his birth,"
3471,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Though cannon rocked his cradle, heaven might hear,"
3472,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Once more, the Mother and her infant Child."
3473,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,
3474,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,_Will the Five Clock-Towers chime tonight?_
3475,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"--Child, the red earth would shake with scorn.--"
3476,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,_But will the Emperors laugh outright
3477,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,If Roland rings that Christ is born?_
3478,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,
3479,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,No belfries pealed for that pure birth.
3480,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,There were no high-stalled choirs to sing.
3481,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,The blood of children smoked on earth;
3482,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"For Herod, in those days, was king.--"
3483,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,
3484,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"_O, then the Mother and her Son"
3485,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Were refugees that Christmas, too?_--"
3486,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Through all the ages, little one,"
3487,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,That strange old story still comes true.--
3488,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,
3489,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,_Was there no peace in Bethlehem?_--
3490,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Yes. There was Love in one poor Inn;
3491,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"And, while His wings were over them,"
3492,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,They heard those deeper songs begin.--
3493,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,
3494,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,_What songs were they? What songs were they?
3495,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Did stars of shrapnel shed their light?_--
3496,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"O, little child, I have lost the way."
3497,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,I cannot find that Inn tonight.--
3498,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,
3499,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"_Is there no peace, then, anywhere?_--"
3500,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Perhaps, where some poor soldier lies"
3501,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"With all his wounds in front, out there.--"
3502,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,_You weep?_--He had your innocent eyes.--
3503,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,
3504,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"_Then is it true that Christ's a slave,"
3505,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Whom all these wrongs can never rouse?_--
3506,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,They said it. But His anger drave
3507,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,The money-changers from His House.--
3508,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,
3509,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,_Yet He forgave and turned away._--
3510,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Yes, unto seventy times and seven."
3511,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,But they forget. He comes one day
3512,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"In power, among the clouds of heaven.--"
3513,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,
3514,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"_Then Roland rings?_--Yes, little son!"
3515,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"With iron hammers they dare not scorn,"
3516,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Roland is breaking them, gun by gun,"
3517,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Roland is ringing. Christ is born.
3518,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,
3519,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Born and re-born; for though the Christ we knew
3520,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"On earth be dead for ever, who shall kill"
3521,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"The Eternal Christ whose law is in our hearts,"
3522,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Christ, who in this dark hour descends to hell,"
3523,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"And ascends into heaven, and sits beside"
3524,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,The right hand of the Father. If for men
3525,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"This law be dead, it lives for children still."
3526,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Children that men have butchered see His face,"
3527,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Rest in His arms, and strike our mockery dumb."
3528,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,So shall the trumpet of the law resound
3529,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Through all the ages, telling of that child"
3530,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Whose outstretched arms in Belgium speak for God.
3531,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,
3532,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"They crucified a Man of old,"
3533,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,The thorns are shrivelled on His brow.
3534,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Prophet or fool or God, behold,"
3535,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,They crucify Thy children now.
3536,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"They doubted evil, doubted good,"
3537,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"And the eternal heavens as well,"
3538,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Behold, the iron and the blood,"
3539,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,The visible handiwork of Hell.
3540,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,
3541,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Fast to the cross they found it there,"
3542,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"They found it in the village street,"
3543,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"A naked child, with sunkissed hair."
3544,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,The nails were through its hands and feet.
3545,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"For Christ was dead, yes, Christ was dead!"
3546,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"O Lamb of God, O little one,"
3547,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,I kneel before your cross instead
3548,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,And the same shadow veils the sun....
3549,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,
3550,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,And the same shadow veils the sun....
3551,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,
3552,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"But you, O land, O beautiful land of Freedom,"
3553,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Hold fast the faith which made and keeps you great.
3554,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"With you, with you abide the faith and hope,"
3555,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"In this dark hour, of agonised mankind."
3556,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Hold to that law whereby the warring tribes
3557,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Were merged in nations, hold to that wide law"
3558,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Which bids you merge the nations, here and now,"
3559,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Into one people. Hold to that deep law
3560,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Whereby we reach the peace which is not death
3561,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"But the triumphant harmony of Life,"
3562,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,"Eternal Life, immortal Love, the Peace"
3563,THE TRUMPET OF THE LAW,Of worlds that sing around the throne of God.

3571,THRICE-ARMED,"Thus only should it come, if come it must--"
3572,THRICE-ARMED,"Not with a riot of flags and a mob-born cry,"
3573,THRICE-ARMED,"But with a noble faith, a conscience high"
3574,THRICE-ARMED,"That, if we fail, we failed not in our trust."
3575,THRICE-ARMED,We fought for peace. We dared the bitter thrust
3576,THRICE-ARMED,"Of calumny for peace, and watched her die,"
3577,THRICE-ARMED,Her scutcheons rent from sky to outraged sky
3578,THRICE-ARMED,By felon hands and trampled into the dust.
3579,THRICE-ARMED,
3580,THRICE-ARMED,"We proffered justice, and we saw the law"
3581,THRICE-ARMED,Cancelled by stroke on stroke of those deft hands
3582,THRICE-ARMED,Which still retain the imperial forger's pen.
3583,THRICE-ARMED,"They must have blood--Then, at this last, we draw"
3584,THRICE-ARMED,"The sword, not with a riot of flags and bands,"
3585,THRICE-ARMED,"But silence, and a mustering of men."
3586,THRICE-ARMED,
3587,THRICE-ARMED,"They challenge Truth. A people makes reply,"
3588,THRICE-ARMED,"East, West, North, South, one honour and one might,"
3589,THRICE-ARMED,"From sea to sea, from height to war-worn height,"
3590,THRICE-ARMED,The old word rings out--to conquer or to die.
3591,THRICE-ARMED,And we shall conquer! Though their eagles fly
3592,THRICE-ARMED,"Through heaven, around this ancient isle unite"
3593,THRICE-ARMED,"Powers that were never vanquished in the fight,"
3594,THRICE-ARMED,The unconquerable Powers that cannot lie.
3595,THRICE-ARMED,
3596,THRICE-ARMED,"Though fire destroy her flesh, and many a year"
3597,THRICE-ARMED,"This land forgot the faith that made her great,"
3598,THRICE-ARMED,"Now, as her fleets cast off the North Sea foam,"
3599,THRICE-ARMED,"Casting aside all faction and all fear,"
3600,THRICE-ARMED,"Thrice-armed in all the majesty of her fate,"
3601,THRICE-ARMED,"Britain remembers, and her sword strikes home."

3610,THE SONG-TREE,"As thou hast ever grown,"
3611,THE SONG-TREE,"Since first, a wondering child,"
3612,THE SONG-TREE,"Long since, I cherished thee."
3613,THE SONG-TREE,"It was at break of day,"
3614,THE SONG-TREE,"Well I remember it,--"
3615,THE SONG-TREE,"The first note that I heard,"
3616,THE SONG-TREE,"A magical undertone,"
3617,THE SONG-TREE,Sweeter than any bird
3618,THE SONG-TREE,--Or so it seemed to me--
3619,THE SONG-TREE,And my tears ran wild.
3620,THE SONG-TREE,"This tale, this tale is true."
3621,THE SONG-TREE,The light was growing gray;
3622,THE SONG-TREE,And the rhymes ran so sweet
3623,THE SONG-TREE,(For I was only a child)
3624,THE SONG-TREE,That I knelt down to pray.
3625,THE SONG-TREE,
3626,THE SONG-TREE,"Grow, my song, like a tree."
3627,THE SONG-TREE,Since then I have forgot
3628,THE SONG-TREE,"A thousand friends, but not"
3629,THE SONG-TREE,"The song that set me free,"
3630,THE SONG-TREE,So that to thee I gave
3631,THE SONG-TREE,"My hopes and my despairs,"
3632,THE SONG-TREE,"My boyhood's ecstasy,"
3633,THE SONG-TREE,My manhood's prayers.
3634,THE SONG-TREE,"In dreams I have watched thee grow,"
3635,THE SONG-TREE,"A ladder of sweet boughs,"
3636,THE SONG-TREE,"Where angels come and go,"
3637,THE SONG-TREE,And birds keep house.
3638,THE SONG-TREE,"In dreams, I have seen thee wave"
3639,THE SONG-TREE,"Over a distant land,"
3640,THE SONG-TREE,"And watched thy roots expand,"
3641,THE SONG-TREE,"And given my life to thee,"
3642,THE SONG-TREE,As I would give my grave.
3643,THE SONG-TREE,
3644,THE SONG-TREE,"Grow, my song, like a tree,"
3645,THE SONG-TREE,"And when I am grown old,"
3646,THE SONG-TREE,"Let me die under thee,"
3647,THE SONG-TREE,Die to enrich thy mould;
3648,THE SONG-TREE,"Die at thy roots, and so"
3649,THE SONG-TREE,Help thee to grow.
3650,THE SONG-TREE,Make of this body and blood
3651,THE SONG-TREE,Thy sempiternal food.
3652,THE SONG-TREE,"Then let some little child,"
3653,THE SONG-TREE,"Some friend I shall not see,"
3654,THE SONG-TREE,"When the great dawn is gray,"
3655,THE SONG-TREE,"Some lover I have not known,"
3656,THE SONG-TREE,"In summers far away,"
3657,THE SONG-TREE,Sit listening under thee.
3658,THE SONG-TREE,And in thy rustling hear
3659,THE SONG-TREE,"That mystical undertone,"
3660,THE SONG-TREE,"Which made my tears run wild,"
3661,THE SONG-TREE,"And made thee, O, how dear."
3662,THE SONG-TREE,
3663,THE SONG-TREE,In the great years to be?
3664,THE SONG-TREE,"I am proud then? Ah, not so."
3665,THE SONG-TREE,I have lived and died for thee.
3666,THE SONG-TREE,Be patient Grow.
