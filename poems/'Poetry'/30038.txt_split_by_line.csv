44,NOTE,For the privilege of reprinting the rimes gathered here I am indebted to
45,NOTE,"the courtesy of the _Chicago Tribune_ and _Puck_, in whose pages most of"
46,NOTE,"them first appeared. ""The Lay of St. Ambrose"" is new."
47,NOTE,
48,NOTE,One reason for rounding up this fugitive verse and prisoning it between
49,NOTE,covers was this: Frequently--more or less--I receive a request for a
50,NOTE,"copy of this jingle or that, and it is easier to mention a publishing"
51,NOTE,house than to search through ancient and dusty files.
52,NOTE,
53,NOTE,The other reason was that I wanted to.

74,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.
75,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
76,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
77,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Ambrose the anchorite old and grey
78,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Larruped himself in his lonely cell,"
79,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,And many a welt on his pious pelt
80,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,The scourge evoked as it rose and fell.
81,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
82,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,For hours together the flagellant leather
83,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Went whacketty-whack with his groans of pain;
84,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"And the lay-brothers said, with a wag of the head,"
85,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"""Ambrose has been at the bottle again."""
86,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
87,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"And such, in sooth, was the sober truth;"
88,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,For the single fault of this saintly soul
89,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Was a desert thirst for the cup accurst,--"
90,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,A quenchless love for the Flowing Bowl.
91,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
92,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,When he woke at morn with a head forlorn
93,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"And a taste like a last-year swallow's nest,"
94,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"He would kneel and pray, then rise and flay"
95,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,His sinful body like all possessed.
96,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
97,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Frequently tempted, he fell from grace,"
98,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,And as often he found the devil to pay;
99,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,But by diligent scourging and diligent purging
100,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,He managed to keep Old Nick at bay.
101,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
102,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"This was the plight of our anchorite,--"
103,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"An endless penance condemned to dree,--"
104,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,When it chanced one day there came his way
105,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,A Mystical Book with a golden Key.
106,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
107,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"This Mystical Book was a guide to health,"
108,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,That none might follow and go astray;
109,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,While a turn of the Key unlocked the wealth
110,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,That all unknown in the Scriptures lay.
111,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
112,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Disease is sin, the Book defined;"
113,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Sickness is error to which men cling;
114,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Pain is merely a state of mind,"
115,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,And matter a non-existent thing.
116,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
117,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"If a tooth should ache, or a leg should break,"
118,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"You simply ""affirm"" and it's sound again."
119,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Cut and contusion are only delusion,"
120,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,And indigestion a fancied pain.
121,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
122,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"For pain is naught if you ""hold a thought,"""
123,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Fevers fly at your simple say;
124,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"You have but to affirm, and every germ"
125,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Will fold up its tent and steal away.
126,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
127,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,. . . . . . . . . .
128,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
129,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,From matin gong to even-song
130,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Ambrose pondered this mystic lore,"
131,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Till what had seemed fiction took on a conviction
132,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,That words had never possessed before.
133,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
134,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"""If pain,"" quoth he, ""is a state of mind,"
135,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"If a rough hair shirt to silk is kin,--"
136,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"If these things are error, pray where's the terror"
137,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,In scourging and purging oneself of sin?
138,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
139,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"""It certainly seemeth good to me,"
140,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"By and large, in part and in whole."
141,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"I'll put it in practice and find if it fact is,"
142,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Or only a mystical rigmarole."""
143,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
144,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,. . . . . . . . . .
145,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
146,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,The very next night our anchorite
147,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Of the Flowing Bowl drank long and deep.
148,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"He argued this wise: ""New Thought applies"
149,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"No fitter to lamb than it does to sheep."""
150,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
151,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,When he woke at morn with a head forlorn
152,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"And a taste akin to a parrot's cage,"
153,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"He knelt and prayed, then up and flayed"
154,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,His sinful flesh in a righteous rage.
155,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
156,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Whacketty-whack on breast and back,"
157,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Whacketty-whack, before, behind;"
158,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"But he held the thought as he laid it on,"
159,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"""Pain is merely a state of mind."""
160,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
161,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Whacketty-whack on breast and back,"
162,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Whacketty-whack on calf and shin;
163,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"And the lay-brothers said, with a wag of the head,"
164,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"""_Ain't_ he the glutton for discipline!"""
165,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
166,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,. . . . . . . . . .
167,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
168,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Now every night our anchorite
169,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Was exceedingly tight when he went to bed.
170,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"The scourge that once pained him no longer restrained him,"
171,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Nor even the fear of an aching head.
172,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
173,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,For he woke at morn with a pate as clear
174,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,As the silvery chime of the matin bell;
175,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"And without any jogging he fell to his flogging,"
176,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,And larruped himself in his lonely cell.
177,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
178,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,But the leather had lost its power to sting;
179,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,To pangs of the flesh he was now immune;
180,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"His rough hair shirt no longer hurt,"
181,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Nor the pebbles he wore in his wooden shoon.
182,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
183,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,When conscience was troubled he cheerfully doubled
184,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,His matinal dose of discipline;--
185,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"A deuce of a scourging, sufficient for purging"
186,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,The Devil himself of original sin.
187,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
188,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Whacketty-whack on breast and back,"
189,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Whacketty-whack from morn to noon;
190,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Whacketty-whacketty-whacketty-whack!--
191,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Till the abbey rang with the dismal tune.
192,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
193,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Deacon and prior, lay-brother and friar"
194,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Exclaimed at these whoppings spectacular;
195,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,And even the Abbot remarked that the habit
196,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Of scourging oneself might be carried too far.
197,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
198,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"""My son,"" said he, ""I am pleased to see"
199,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Such penance as never was known before;
200,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"But you raise such a racket in dusting your jacket,"
201,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,The noise is becoming a bit of a bore.
202,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
203,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"""How would it do if you whaled yourself"
204,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,From eight to ten or from one to three?
205,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Or if 'More' is your motto, pray hire a grotto;"
206,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"I know of one you can have rent free."""
207,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
208,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,. . . . . . . . . .
209,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
210,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Ambrose the anchorite bowed his head,"
211,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,And girded his loins and went away.
212,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"He rented a cavern not far from a tavern,"
213,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,And tippled by night and scourged by day.
214,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
215,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"The more the penance the more the sin,"
216,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,The more he whopped him the more he drank;
217,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Till his hair fell out and his cheeks fell in,"
218,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,And his corpulent figure grew long and lank.
219,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
220,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"At Whitsuntide he up and died,"
221,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,While flaying himself for his final spree.
222,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,And who shall say whether 'twas liquor or leather
223,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,That hurried him into eternity?
224,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,
225,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"They made him a saint, as well they might,"
226,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,And gave him a beautiful aureole.
227,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"And--somehow or other, this circle of light"
228,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,Suggests the rim of the Flowing Bowl.

321,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,"Read to you, Little One? Why, yes."

340,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,Who nightly nestles on my knee;

342,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,Psychologists may puzzle o'er.
343,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,"Her likes are mine, and I agree"
344,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,With all that she confides to me.
345,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,"And thus we travel, hand in hand,"
346,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,The storied roads of Fairyland.

348,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,"Ah, Little One, when years have fled,"
349,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,"And left their silver on my head,"
350,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,And when the dimming eyes of age
351,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,"With difficulty scan the page,"
352,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,Perhaps _I'll_ turn the tables then;
353,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,"Perhaps _I'll_ put the question, when"

2836,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,
2837,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,How dear to this heart is the old roller towel
2838,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,Which fond recollection presents to my view.
2839,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,"It hung like a pall on the wall of the washroom,"
2840,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,And gathered the grime of the linotype crew.
2841,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,The sink and the soap and the lye that stood by it
2842,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,Remain; but the towel is gone past recall.
2843,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,"O tempora! Also, O mores! Sic transit"

2846,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,The tacky old towel that hung on the wall.
2847,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,
2848,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,Now hangs in the washroom a huge roll of paper--
2849,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,The old printer's towel we'll never see more.
2850,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,"The new (see directions) is ""used like a blotter,"""
2851,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,And crumpled and scattered in wads on the floor.
2852,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,"And often, when drying my hands in this fashion,"
2853,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,"The tears of remembrance will gather and fall,"
2854,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,And I sigh (though I'm not what you'd call sentimental)
2855,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,For the classic old towel that propped up the wall.
2856,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,"The sainted old towel, the tainted old towel,"
2857,THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL,The gooey old towel that hung on the wall.
