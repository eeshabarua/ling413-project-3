92,VIRGO DULCIS.,
93,VIRGO DULCIS.,
94,VIRGO DULCIS.,First Litany.
95,VIRGO DULCIS.,
96,VIRGO DULCIS.,Virgo Dulcis.
97,VIRGO DULCIS.,
98,VIRGO DULCIS.,
99,VIRGO DULCIS.,i.
100,VIRGO DULCIS.,
101,VIRGO DULCIS.,O thou refulgent essence of all grace!
102,VIRGO DULCIS.,O thou that with the witchery of thy face
103,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Hast made of me thy servant unto death,"
104,VIRGO DULCIS.,"I pray thee pause, ere, musical of breath,"
105,VIRGO DULCIS.,"And rapt of utterance, thou condemn indeed"
106,VIRGO DULCIS.,"My venturous wooing, and the wanton speed"
107,VIRGO DULCIS.,"With which I greet thee, dear and tender soul!"
108,VIRGO DULCIS.,From out the fullness of my passion-creed.
109,VIRGO DULCIS.,
110,VIRGO DULCIS.,
111,VIRGO DULCIS.,ii.
112,VIRGO DULCIS.,
113,VIRGO DULCIS.,I am so truly thine that nevermore
114,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Shall man be found, this side the Stygian shore,"
115,VIRGO DULCIS.,"So meek as I, so patient under blame,"
116,VIRGO DULCIS.,"And yet, withal, so minded to proclaim"
117,VIRGO DULCIS.,His life-long ardour. For my theme is just:
118,VIRGO DULCIS.,"A heart enslaved, a smile, a broken trust,"
119,VIRGO DULCIS.,"A soft mirage, a glimpse of fairyland,"
120,VIRGO DULCIS.,And then the wreck thereof in tears and dust.
121,VIRGO DULCIS.,
122,VIRGO DULCIS.,
123,VIRGO DULCIS.,iii.
124,VIRGO DULCIS.,
125,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Thou wast not made for murder, yet a glance"
126,VIRGO DULCIS.,"May murderous prove; and beauty may entrance,"
127,VIRGO DULCIS.,More than a syren's or a serpent's eye.
128,VIRGO DULCIS.,And there are moments when a smother'd sigh
129,VIRGO DULCIS.,"May hint at comfort and a murmur'd ""No"""
130,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Give signs of ""Yes,"" and Misery's overflow"
131,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Make tears more precious than we care to tell,"
132,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Though, one by one, our hopes we must forego."
133,VIRGO DULCIS.,
134,VIRGO DULCIS.,
135,VIRGO DULCIS.,iv.
136,VIRGO DULCIS.,
137,VIRGO DULCIS.,I should have shunn'd thee as a man may shun
138,VIRGO DULCIS.,His evil hour. I should have curst the sun
139,VIRGO DULCIS.,That made the day so bright and earth so fair
140,VIRGO DULCIS.,"When first we met, delirium through the air"
141,VIRGO DULCIS.,Burning like fire! I should have curst the moon
142,VIRGO DULCIS.,"And all the stars that, dream-like, in a swoon"
143,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Shut out the day,--the lov'd, the lovely day"
144,VIRGO DULCIS.,That came too late and left us all too soon.
145,VIRGO DULCIS.,
146,VIRGO DULCIS.,
147,VIRGO DULCIS.,v.
148,VIRGO DULCIS.,
149,VIRGO DULCIS.,"I look'd at thee, and lo! from face to feet,"
150,VIRGO DULCIS.,"I saw my tyrant, and I felt the beat"
151,VIRGO DULCIS.,Of my quick pulse. I knew thee for a queen
152,VIRGO DULCIS.,And bow'd submissive; and the smile serene
153,VIRGO DULCIS.,Of thy sweet face reveal'd the soul of thee.
154,VIRGO DULCIS.,For I was wounded as a man may be
155,VIRGO DULCIS.,Whom Eros tricks with words he will not prove;
156,VIRGO DULCIS.,And all my peace of mind went out from me.
157,VIRGO DULCIS.,
158,VIRGO DULCIS.,
159,VIRGO DULCIS.,vi.
160,VIRGO DULCIS.,
161,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Oh, why didst cheer me with the thought of bliss,"
162,VIRGO DULCIS.,And wouldst not pay me back my luckless kiss?
163,VIRGO DULCIS.,I sought thy side. I gave thee of my store
164,VIRGO DULCIS.,One wild salute. A flame was at the core
165,VIRGO DULCIS.,Of that first kiss; and on my mouth I feel
166,VIRGO DULCIS.,"The glow thereof, the pressure and the seal,"
167,VIRGO DULCIS.,"As if thy nature, when the deed was done,"
168,VIRGO DULCIS.,Had leapt to mine in lightning-like appeal.
169,VIRGO DULCIS.,
170,VIRGO DULCIS.,
171,VIRGO DULCIS.,vii.
172,VIRGO DULCIS.,
173,VIRGO DULCIS.,If debts were paid in full I might require
174,VIRGO DULCIS.,"More than my kiss. I might, in time, aspire"
175,VIRGO DULCIS.,"To some new bond, or re-enact the first."
176,VIRGO DULCIS.,"For once, thou know'st, the love for which I thirst,"
177,VIRGO DULCIS.,"The love for which I hunger'd in thy sight,"
178,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Was not withheld. I deem'd thee, day and night,"
179,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Mine own true mate, and sent thee token flowers"
180,VIRGO DULCIS.,To figure forth the hopes I'd fain indite.
181,VIRGO DULCIS.,
182,VIRGO DULCIS.,
183,VIRGO DULCIS.,viii.
184,VIRGO DULCIS.,
185,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Is this not so? Canst thou detend, in truth,"
186,VIRGO DULCIS.,"The sunlike smile with which, in flush of youth,"
187,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Thou didst accept my greeting,--though so late,--"
188,VIRGO DULCIS.,My love-lorn homage when the voice of Fate
189,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Fell from thy lips, and made me twice a man"
190,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Because half thine, in that betrothal-plan"
191,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Whereof I spake, not knowing how 'twould be"
192,VIRGO DULCIS.,When May had marr'd the prospects it began?
193,VIRGO DULCIS.,
194,VIRGO DULCIS.,
195,VIRGO DULCIS.,ix.
196,VIRGO DULCIS.,
197,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Can'st thou deny that, early in the spring,"
198,VIRGO DULCIS.,"When daisies droop'd, and birds were fain to sing,"
199,VIRGO DULCIS.,"We met, and talk'd, and walk'd, and were content"
200,VIRGO DULCIS.,In sunlit paths? An hour and more we spent
201,VIRGO DULCIS.,In Keats's Grove. We linger'd near the stem
202,VIRGO DULCIS.,Of that lone tree on which was seen the gem
203,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Of his bright name, there carven by himself;"
204,VIRGO DULCIS.,And then I stoop'd and kiss'd thy garment's hem.
205,VIRGO DULCIS.,
206,VIRGO DULCIS.,
207,VIRGO DULCIS.,x.
208,VIRGO DULCIS.,
209,VIRGO DULCIS.,"I gave thee all my life. I gave thee there,"
210,VIRGO DULCIS.,"In that wild hour, the great Creator's share"
211,VIRGO DULCIS.,Of mine existence; and I turn'd to thee
212,VIRGO DULCIS.,"As men to idols, madly on my knee;"
213,VIRGO DULCIS.,"And then uplifted by those arms of thine,"
214,VIRGO DULCIS.,"I sat beside thee, warm'd with other wine"
215,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Than vintage balm; and, mindful of thy blush,"
216,VIRGO DULCIS.,I guess'd a thought which words will not define.
217,VIRGO DULCIS.,
218,VIRGO DULCIS.,
219,VIRGO DULCIS.,xi.
220,VIRGO DULCIS.,
221,VIRGO DULCIS.,I told thee stories of the days of joy
222,VIRGO DULCIS.,"When earth was young, and love without alloy"
223,VIRGO DULCIS.,Made all things glad and all the thoughts of things.
224,VIRGO DULCIS.,"And like a man who wonders when he sings,"
225,VIRGO DULCIS.,"And knows not whence the power that in him lies,"
226,VIRGO DULCIS.,I made a madrigal of all my sighs
227,VIRGO DULCIS.,And bade thee heed them; and I join'd therewith
228,VIRGO DULCIS.,The texts of these my follies that I prize.
229,VIRGO DULCIS.,
230,VIRGO DULCIS.,
231,VIRGO DULCIS.,xii.
232,VIRGO DULCIS.,
233,VIRGO DULCIS.,"I spoke of men, long dead, who wooed in vain"
234,VIRGO DULCIS.,"And yet were happy,--men whose tender pain"
235,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Was fraught with fervor, as the night with stars."
236,VIRGO DULCIS.,And then I spoke of heroes' battle-scars
237,VIRGO DULCIS.,And lordly souls who rode from land to land
238,VIRGO DULCIS.,To win the love-touch of a lady's hand;
239,VIRGO DULCIS.,And on the strings of thy low-murmuring lute
240,VIRGO DULCIS.,I struck the chords that all men understand.
241,VIRGO DULCIS.,
242,VIRGO DULCIS.,
243,VIRGO DULCIS.,xiii.
244,VIRGO DULCIS.,
245,VIRGO DULCIS.,"I sang to thee. I praised thee with my praise,"
246,VIRGO DULCIS.,"E'en as a bird, conceal'd in sylvan ways,"
247,VIRGO DULCIS.,"May laud the rose, and wish, from hour to hour,"
248,VIRGO DULCIS.,"That he had petals like the empress-flower,"
249,VIRGO DULCIS.,"And there could grow, unwing'd, and be a bud,"
250,VIRGO DULCIS.,With all his warblings ta'en at singing-flood
251,VIRGO DULCIS.,And turned to vàgaries of the wildest scent
252,VIRGO DULCIS.,To undermine the meekness in her blood.
253,VIRGO DULCIS.,
254,VIRGO DULCIS.,
255,VIRGO DULCIS.,xiv.
256,VIRGO DULCIS.,
257,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Ah, those were days! That April should have been"
258,VIRGO DULCIS.,"My last on earth, and, ere the frondage green"
259,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Had changed to gold, I should have join'd the ranks"
260,VIRGO DULCIS.,Of dull dead men who lived for little thanks
261,VIRGO DULCIS.,"And made the most thereof, though penance-bound."
262,VIRGO DULCIS.,I should have known that in the daily round
263,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Of mine existence, there are griefs to spare,"
264,VIRGO DULCIS.,"But joys, alas! too few on any ground."
265,VIRGO DULCIS.,
266,VIRGO DULCIS.,
267,VIRGO DULCIS.,xv.
268,VIRGO DULCIS.,
269,VIRGO DULCIS.,"And here I stand to-day with bended head,"
270,VIRGO DULCIS.,"My task undone, my garden overspread"
271,VIRGO DULCIS.,With baneful weeds. Am I the lord thereof?
272,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Or mine own slave, without the power to doff"
273,VIRGO DULCIS.,"My misery's badge? Am I so weak withal,"
274,VIRGO DULCIS.,"That I must loiter, though the bugle's call"
275,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Shrills o'er the moor, the far-off weltering moor,"
276,VIRGO DULCIS.,Where foemen meet to vanquish or to fall?
277,VIRGO DULCIS.,
278,VIRGO DULCIS.,
279,VIRGO DULCIS.,xvi.
280,VIRGO DULCIS.,
281,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Am I so blurr'd in soul, so out of health,"
282,VIRGO DULCIS.,"That I must turn to thee, as if by stealth,"
283,VIRGO DULCIS.,"And fear thy censure, fear thy quick rebuff,"
284,VIRGO DULCIS.,And thou so gentle in a world so rough
285,VIRGO DULCIS.,"That God's high priest, the morn-apparell'd sun"
286,VIRGO DULCIS.,Ne'er saw thy like! Am I indeed undone
287,VIRGO DULCIS.,Of life and love and all? and must I weep
288,VIRGO DULCIS.,"For joys that quit me, and for sands that run?"
289,VIRGO DULCIS.,
290,VIRGO DULCIS.,
291,VIRGO DULCIS.,xvii.
292,VIRGO DULCIS.,
293,VIRGO DULCIS.,"To-morrow's dawn will break; but Yesterday,"
294,VIRGO DULCIS.,Where is its light? And where the breezes' play
295,VIRGO DULCIS.,"That sway'd the flowers? A bird will sing again,"
296,VIRGO DULCIS.,"But not so well. The wind upon the plain,"
297,VIRGO DULCIS.,"The wintry wind, will toss the groaning trees;"
298,VIRGO DULCIS.,"But I, what comfort shall I have of these,"
299,VIRGO DULCIS.,"To know that they, unlov'd, have lost the Spring,"
300,VIRGO DULCIS.,As I thy favour and my power to please?
301,VIRGO DULCIS.,
302,VIRGO DULCIS.,
303,VIRGO DULCIS.,xviii.
304,VIRGO DULCIS.,
305,VIRGO DULCIS.,I should have learnt a lesson from the songs
306,VIRGO DULCIS.,Of woodland birds discoursing on the wrongs
307,VIRGO DULCIS.,Of madcap moths and bachelor butterflies.
308,VIRGO DULCIS.,I should have caught the cadence of the sighs
309,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Of unwed flowers, and learnt the way to woo,"
310,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Which all things know but I, beneath the blue"
311,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Of Heaven's great dome; for, undesired of thee,"
312,VIRGO DULCIS.,I have but jarr'd the notes that seem'd so true.
313,VIRGO DULCIS.,
314,VIRGO DULCIS.,
315,VIRGO DULCIS.,xix.
316,VIRGO DULCIS.,
317,VIRGO DULCIS.,"I should have told thee all I meant to tell,"
318,VIRGO DULCIS.,"And how, at Lammas-tide, a wedding-bell"
319,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Rang through my sleep, mine own as well as thine;"
320,VIRGO DULCIS.,"And how I led thee, smiling, to a shrine"
321,VIRGO DULCIS.,And there endow'd thee with the name I bear;
322,VIRGO DULCIS.,And how I woke to find the morning-air
323,VIRGO DULCIS.,Flooded with light. I should have told thee this
324,VIRGO DULCIS.,And not conceal'd the theme of my long prayer.
325,VIRGO DULCIS.,
326,VIRGO DULCIS.,
327,VIRGO DULCIS.,xx.
328,VIRGO DULCIS.,
329,VIRGO DULCIS.,"But I was timid. Oh, my love was such"
330,VIRGO DULCIS.,I scarce could name it! Trembling over-much
331,VIRGO DULCIS.,"With too much ardour, I was moved at length"
332,VIRGO DULCIS.,To mere mad utterance. In a blameful strength
333,VIRGO DULCIS.,"I seiz'd thy hand, to scare thee, as of old"
334,VIRGO DULCIS.,Dryads were scared; and calm and icy-cold
335,VIRGO DULCIS.,"Thine answer came: ""I pray thee, vex me not!"""
336,VIRGO DULCIS.,And all that day 'twas winter on the wold.

361,_VOX AMORIS_.,"My love is deeper than the bounding sea,"

387,_VOX AMORIS_.,"It is this gem for which, had I a crown,"
388,_VOX AMORIS_.,"I'd barter peace and pomp, and ermined gown;"

394,_VOX AMORIS_.,
395,_VOX AMORIS_.,I would attack a panther in its den

397,_VOX AMORIS_.,"Or front the Fates, or, like a ghoul, confer"
398,_VOX AMORIS_.,With staring ghosts outside a sepulchre.
399,_VOX AMORIS_.,"I would forego a limb to give thee life,"
400,_VOX AMORIS_.,"Or yield my soul itself in any strife,"

404,_VOX AMORIS_.,
405,_VOX AMORIS_.,v.
406,_VOX AMORIS_.,
407,_VOX AMORIS_.,"It is my solace, all my nights and days,"
408,_VOX AMORIS_.,"To pray for thee and dote on thee always,"
409,_VOX AMORIS_.,And evermore to count myself a king

1981,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
1982,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
1983,DOMINA EXAUDI.,ix.
1984,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
1985,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"By right of music, for a fleeting term,"
1986,DOMINA EXAUDI.,Mine arms enwound thee and I held thee firm
1987,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"There on my breast,--so near, yet so remote,"
1988,DOMINA EXAUDI.,So close about me that I seem'd to float
1989,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"In sunlit rapture,--touch'd I know not how"
1990,DOMINA EXAUDI.,By some suggestion of a deeper vow
1991,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Than men are 'ware of when, on Glory's track,"
1992,DOMINA EXAUDI.,They kneel to angels with uplifted brow.

1998,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"All that is past:--the yearning undefined,--"
1999,DOMINA EXAUDI.,The baulk'd confession that was like a sob--
2000,DOMINA EXAUDI.,The sound of singing and the gurgling throb
2001,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Of lute and viol,--meant for many things"
2002,DOMINA EXAUDI.,But most for misery; and a something clings
2003,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Close to my heart that is not wantonness,"
2004,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Though, wanton-like, it warms me while it stings."

2008,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2009,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"The night returns,--that night of all the nights!"
2010,DOMINA EXAUDI.,And I am dower'd anew with such delights
2011,DOMINA EXAUDI.,As memory feeds on; for I walk'd with thee
2012,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"In moonlit gardens, and there flew to me"
2013,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"A flower-like moth, a pinion'd daffodil,"
2014,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"From Nature's hand; and, out beyond the hill,"
2015,DOMINA EXAUDI.,There rose a star I joy'd to look upon
2016,DOMINA EXAUDI.,Because it seem'd the star of thy good will.
2017,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2018,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2019,DOMINA EXAUDI.,xii.
2020,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2021,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"We sat beneath the trees, as well thou know'st,"
2022,DOMINA EXAUDI.,Within an arbour which a summer's boast
2023,DOMINA EXAUDI.,Had made ambrosial; and we loiter'd there
2024,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Some little space, the while upon the air"
2025,DOMINA EXAUDI.,Uprose the fragrance of uncounted flowers.
2026,DOMINA EXAUDI.,Ah me! how weird a tryste was that of ours!
2027,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"And how the moon look'd down, so lurid-warm,"
2028,DOMINA EXAUDI.,Athwart the stillness of the frondage-towers!

2030,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2031,DOMINA EXAUDI.,xiii.
2032,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2033,DOMINA EXAUDI.,I seem'd to feel thy breath upon my cheek;
2034,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"I vainly searched for words I long'd to speak,"
2035,DOMINA EXAUDI.,But could not utter lest the sound thereof
2036,DOMINA EXAUDI.,Should scare away the elves that wait on love.
2037,DOMINA EXAUDI.,And when I spoke to thee 'twas of the spot
2038,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Where we were seated,--things that matter'd not,--"
2039,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Uncared for things,--the weather,--the new laws!"
2040,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"And, sudden-loud, the wind assail'd the grot."

2042,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2043,DOMINA EXAUDI.,xiv.
2044,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2045,DOMINA EXAUDI.,A little bird was warbling overhead
2046,DOMINA EXAUDI.,As if to twit me with the word unsaid
2047,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Which he, more daring, when the sun was high,"
2048,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Trill'd to his mate! He knew the tender ""why"""
2049,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Of many a pleading, and he knew, meseems,"
2050,DOMINA EXAUDI.,The very key-note to the lyric dreams
2051,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Of all true poets when, by love impell'd,"
2052,DOMINA EXAUDI.,They search the secrets of the woods and streams.
2053,DOMINA EXAUDI.,

2056,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2057,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"'Tis sure that summer, when she rear'd the bower"
2058,DOMINA EXAUDI.,And arched the roof and gave it all the dower
2059,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Of all its leaves, and all the crannies small"
2060,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Where wrens look through,--'tis sure that, after all,"
2061,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Summer was kind, and meant to make for me"
2062,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"A shriving-place,--a lighthouse on the sea"
2063,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Of all that verdure,--that, beneath the stars,"
2064,DOMINA EXAUDI.,I might receive one quickening glance from thee.
2065,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2066,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2067,DOMINA EXAUDI.,xvi.
2068,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2069,DOMINA EXAUDI.,Oh! had I dared to whisper in thine ear
2070,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"My heart-full wish, undaunted by the fear"
2071,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Of some rebuke:--a flush of thy fair face,"
2072,DOMINA EXAUDI.,A lifted hand to tell me that the place
2073,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Was fairy-fenced, and guarded as by flame,--"
2074,DOMINA EXAUDI.,Oh! had I dared to court the word of blame
2075,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"That's good for me, no doubt! at every turn,"
2076,DOMINA EXAUDI.,My life to-day were chasten'd by the same.
2077,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2078,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2079,DOMINA EXAUDI.,xvii.
2080,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2081,DOMINA EXAUDI.,But I was conscious of a sudden ban
2082,DOMINA EXAUDI.,Hurl'd from the zenith. I was like the man
2083,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Who scaled Olympus, with intent to bring"
2084,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"New fire therefrom, and dared not face the King"
2085,DOMINA EXAUDI.,Of thought and thunder. I was full prepared
2086,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"For thy displeasure,--for the past was bared"
2087,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"To mine on-looking; and, with faltering tongue,"
2088,DOMINA EXAUDI.,I left my languorous meanings undeclared.

2090,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2091,DOMINA EXAUDI.,xviii.
2092,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2093,DOMINA EXAUDI.,O lost Occasion! what a thing art thou:--
2094,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"A three-fold key,--the when, the where, the how,--"
2095,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"The past, the present and the future tense,--"
2096,DOMINA EXAUDI.,All thrown aside. For what? A witless sense
2097,DOMINA EXAUDI.,Of some compunction! When the hour is bold
2098,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Reason is shy, and rapture, seeming-cold,"
2099,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Makes mute surrender of its dearest chance,"
2100,DOMINA EXAUDI.,And all for fear of doubts that might be told.

2102,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2103,DOMINA EXAUDI.,xix.
2104,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2105,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"But could we meet, oh! could we meet again"
2106,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"On some such night, unseen upon the plain,"
2107,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"I'd rob thee, Lady! of a tardy smile."
2108,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"I would do this; and, for a breathing-while,"
2109,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"I would assert a sinner's right to pray,"
2110,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"A sinner's right to choose, as best he may,"
2111,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"His patron-saint; and I would kneel to thee,"
2112,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"And call thee mine, and dote on thee for aye!"

2114,DOMINA EXAUDI.,
2115,DOMINA EXAUDI.,xx.

2117,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"And then in summer, when the hours are mad,"
2118,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"And all the flow'rets in the fields are glad,"
2119,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"And all the breezes, like demented things"
2120,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Outspeed the birds with sunlight on their wings,"
2121,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"In summer, aye! in summer's gracious time,"
2122,DOMINA EXAUDI.,I might perchance be pardon'd for the crime
2123,DOMINA EXAUDI.,"Of my much love, and win thy benison"
2124,DOMINA EXAUDI.,Ere yet the year has reached its golden prime!
