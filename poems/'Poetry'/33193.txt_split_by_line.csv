51,PREFACE,PREFACE
52,PREFACE,
53,PREFACE,
54,PREFACE,"In publishing this poem, the Author feels that some apology is needed. It"
55,PREFACE,"deals with matters of a kind not usually treated in modern verse, and"
56,PREFACE,"which ask to be approached, if at all, with dignity and reverence. He"
57,PREFACE,trusts that he will not be found lacking on this essential point.
58,PREFACE,"Nevertheless, he cannot expect but that he may wound by his plain speaking"
59,PREFACE,the feelings of those among his readers who sincerely believe that
60,PREFACE,"Nineteenth Century Civilisation is synonymous with Christianity, and that"
61,PREFACE,"the English Race, above all those in existence, has a special mission from"
62,PREFACE,Heaven to subdue and occupy the Earth. The self-complacency of the
63,PREFACE,Author's countrymen on this head is too deeply seated to be attacked
64,PREFACE,"without offence. He has not, however, shrunk from so attacking, and from"
65,PREFACE,insisting on the truth that the hypocrisy and all-acquiring greed of
66,PREFACE,"modern England is an atrocious spectacle--one which, if there be any"
67,PREFACE,"justice in Heaven, must bring a curse from God, as it has surely already"
68,PREFACE,"made the angels weep. The destruction of beauty in the name of science,"
69,PREFACE,"the destruction of happiness in the name of progress, the destruction of"
70,PREFACE,"reverence in the name of religion, these are the pharisaic crimes of all"
71,PREFACE,the white races; but there is something in the Anglo-Saxon impiety
72,PREFACE,"crueller still: that it also destroys, as no other race does, for its mere"
73,PREFACE,"vain-glorious pleasure. The Anglo-Saxon alone has in our day exterminated,"
74,PREFACE,"root and branch, whole tribes of mankind. He alone has depopulated"
75,PREFACE,"continents, species after species, of their wonderful animal life, and is"
76,PREFACE,"still yearly destroying; and this not merely to occupy the land, for it"
77,PREFACE,"lies in large part empty, but for his insatiable lust of violent"
78,PREFACE,"adventure, to make record bags and kill. That things are so is ample"
79,PREFACE,reason for the hardest words the Author can command.
80,PREFACE,
81,PREFACE,To his fellow poets and poetic critics the Author too would say a word. He
82,PREFACE,has chosen as the vehicle of his thought a metre to which in English they
83,PREFACE,"are unaccustomed, the six-foot Alexandrine couplet. For some reason which"
84,PREFACE,"the Author has never understood, this, the classic metre in France, has"
85,PREFACE,"stood in disrepute with us. Yet he ventures to think that, for rhetorical"
86,PREFACE,"and dramatic purposes, it is infinitely preferable to our own heroic"
87,PREFACE,"couplet, and preferable even, in any hands but the strongest, to our"
88,PREFACE,"traditional blank verse. He believes, moreover, that if our skilled"
89,PREFACE,"dramatists would make trial of it, it would, by its extreme flexibility"
90,PREFACE,"and the natural break of its cesura, enable them to capture that shyest of"
91,PREFACE,"all shy things--success in a rhymed modern play. At least, he trusts that"
92,PREFACE,"they will give it their consideration, and not condemn him off-hand"
93,PREFACE,"because, having a rhetorical subject to deal with, he has treated it"
94,PREFACE,"rhetorically and in what he considers the best rhetoric form, though both"
95,PREFACE,rhetoric and Alexandrines are out of fashion.
96,PREFACE,
97,PREFACE,"Lastly, he has to discharge, in connection with his poem, a double debt of"
98,PREFACE,"gratitude. The poem, unworthy as it is, is, by permission, dedicated to"
99,PREFACE,"the first of living thinkers, Mr. Herbert Spencer. To his reasoned and"
100,PREFACE,life-long advocacy of the rights of the weak in Man's higher evolution is
101,PREFACE,"due all that in the poem is intellectually worthiest, to this and to the"
102,PREFACE,inspiration of much personal encouragement and sympathy received by the
103,PREFACE,Author at a moment of public excitement when it was onerous yet necessary
104,PREFACE,for the Author to speak unpopular truths.
105,PREFACE,
106,PREFACE,To Mr. Spencer's great name the Author would add the name of that other
107,PREFACE,"senior of the ideal world, Mr. George Frederick Watts, the first of living"
108,PREFACE,"painters, with whom, while the poem was in progress, it was his privilege"
109,PREFACE,to spend many emotional hours in high communings on Life and Death and
110,PREFACE,the tragic Beauty of the world. He would thank him publicly here for the
111,PREFACE,"leave generously given him to add to the volume its chief ornament, the"
112,PREFACE,"frontispiece, which is a reproduction of Mr. Watts' Angel of Pity weeping"
113,PREFACE,over the dead birds' wings.
114,PREFACE,
115,PREFACE,To both these heroic workers in the cause of good the Author in gratitude
116,PREFACE,"inscribes himself their faithful servant, disciple, and friend."

126,SATAN ABSOLVED,A Victorian Mystery
127,SATAN ABSOLVED,
128,SATAN ABSOLVED,(_In the antechamber of Heaven. Satan walks alone. Angels in groups
129,SATAN ABSOLVED,conversing_).

133,SATAN,
134,SATAN,"To-day is the Lord's ""day."" Once more on His good pleasure"
135,SATAN,"I, the Heresiarch, wait and pace these halls at leisure"
136,SATAN,"Among the Orthodox, the unfallen Sons of God."
137,SATAN,"How sweet in truth Heaven is, its floors of sandal wood,"
138,SATAN,"Its old-world furniture, its linen long in press,"
139,SATAN,"Its incense, mummeries, flowers, its scent of holiness!"
140,SATAN,Each house has its own smell. The smell of Heaven to me
141,SATAN,Intoxicates and haunts--and hurts. Who would not be
142,SATAN,"God's liveried servant here, the slave of His behest,"
143,SATAN,"Rather than reign outside? I like good things the best,"
144,SATAN,"Fair things, things innocent; and gladly, if He willed,"
145,SATAN,Would enter His Saints' kingdom--even as a little child (_laughs_).
146,SATAN,"I have come to make my peace, to crave a full ""amaun,"""
147,SATAN,"Peace, pardon, reconcilement, truce to our daggers-drawn,"
148,SATAN,"Which have so long distraught the fair wise Universe,"
149,SATAN,An end to my rebellion and the mortal curse
150,SATAN,Of always evil-doing. He will mayhap agree
151,SATAN,I was less wholly wrong about Humanity
152,SATAN,The day I dared to warn His wisdom of that flaw.
153,SATAN,"It was at least the truth, the whole truth I foresaw"
154,SATAN,"When he must needs create that simian ""in His own"
155,SATAN,"Image and likeness."" Faugh! the unseemly carrion!"
156,SATAN,"I claim a new revision and with proofs in hand,"
157,SATAN,No Job now in my path to foil me and withstand.
158,SATAN,"Oh, I will serve Him well!"
159,SATAN,(_Certain Angels approach_). But who are these that come
160,SATAN,With their grieved faces pale and eyes of martyrdom?
161,SATAN,"Not our good Sons of God? They stop, gesticulate,"
162,SATAN,"Argue apart, some weep,--weep, here within Heaven's gate!"
163,SATAN,"Sob almost in God's sight! ay, real salt human tears,"
164,SATAN,Such as no Spirit wept these thrice three thousand years.
165,SATAN,"The last shed were my own, that night of reprobation"
166,SATAN,When I unsheathed my sword and headed the lost nation.
167,SATAN,Since then not one of them has spoken above his breath
168,SATAN,Or whispered in these courts one word of life or death
169,SATAN,"Displeasing to the Lord. No Seraph of them all,"
170,SATAN,"Save I this day each year, has dared to cross Heaven's hall"
171,SATAN,"And give voice to ill news, an unwelcome truth to Him."
172,SATAN,"Not Michael's self hath dared, prince of the Seraphim."
173,SATAN,"Yet all now wail aloud. What ails ye, brethren? Speak!"
174,SATAN,Are ye too in rebellion?

201,ANGELS,Our service has grown vain. We have no rest nor sleep;
202,ANGELS,The Earth's cry is too loud.
203,ANGELS,
204,SATAN,SATAN

222,ANGELS,His pride is in His Earth. If He but looks askance
223,ANGELS,We tremble and grow dumb.

256,SATAN,"The Lord is a just God. He will rejudge this case,"
257,SATAN,"Ay, haply, even mine. O glorious occasion!"
258,SATAN,To champion Heaven's whole right without shift or evasion
259,SATAN,"And plead the Angels' cause! Take courage, my sad heart,"
260,SATAN,"Thine hour hath come to thee, to play this worthiest part"
261,SATAN,"And prove thy right, thine too, to Heaven's moralities,"

477,THE LORD GOD,
478,SATAN,SATAN
479,SATAN,
480,SATAN,"He is here, Lord God,"
481,SATAN,"Ready to speak all truths to Thy face, even ""Ichabod,"
482,SATAN,"Thy glory is departed,"" were _that_ truth."
483,SATAN,
484,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
485,THE LORD GOD,
486,THE LORD GOD,Thou? Here?
487,THE LORD GOD,
488,SATAN,SATAN
489,SATAN,
490,SATAN,"A suppliant for Thy pardon, and in love, not fear,"
491,SATAN,"One who Thou knowest doth love Thee, ay, and more than these."
492,SATAN,
493,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
494,THE LORD GOD,
495,THE LORD GOD,That word was Peter's once.
496,THE LORD GOD,
497,SATAN,SATAN
498,SATAN,
499,SATAN,I speak no flatteries;
500,SATAN,"Nor shall I Thee deny for this man nor that maid,"
501,SATAN,Nor for the cock that crew.
502,SATAN,
503,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
504,THE LORD GOD,
505,THE LORD GOD,Thou shalt not be gainsaid.
506,THE LORD GOD,I grant thee audience. Speak.
507,THE LORD GOD,
508,SATAN,SATAN
509,SATAN,
510,SATAN,Alone?
511,SATAN,
512,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
513,THE LORD GOD,
514,THE LORD GOD,'Twere best alone.
515,THE LORD GOD,"Angels, ye are dismissed. (_The angels depart._) Good Satan, now say on."
516,THE LORD GOD,
517,THE LORD GOD,SATAN (_alone with_ THE LORD GOD)
518,THE LORD GOD,
519,THE LORD GOD,Omnipotent Lord God! Thou knowest all. I speak
520,THE LORD GOD,"Only as Thy poor echo, faltering with words weak,"
521,THE LORD GOD,"A far-off broken sound, yet haply not unheard."
522,THE LORD GOD,"Thou knowest the Worlds Thou madest, and Thine own high word"
523,THE LORD GOD,Declaring they were good. Good were they in all sooth
524,THE LORD GOD,"The mighty Globes Thou mouldedst in the World's fair youth,"
525,THE LORD GOD,"Launched silent through the void, evolving force and light."
526,THE LORD GOD,Thou gatheredst in Thy hand's grasp shards of the Infinite
527,THE LORD GOD,"And churnedst them to Matter; Space concentrated,"
528,THE LORD GOD,"Great, glorious, everlasting. The Stars leaped and fled,"
529,THE LORD GOD,"As hounds, in their young strength. Yet might they not withdraw"
530,THE LORD GOD,From Thy hand's leash and bond. Thou chainedst them with law.
531,THE LORD GOD,"They did not sin, those Stars, change face, wax proud, rebel."
532,THE LORD GOD,"Nay, they were slaves to Thee, things incorruptible."
533,THE LORD GOD,I might not tempt them from Thee.
534,THE LORD GOD,
535,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
536,THE LORD GOD,
537,THE LORD GOD,And the reason?
538,THE LORD GOD,
539,SATAN,SATAN
540,SATAN,
541,SATAN,Hear.
542,SATAN,"Thou gavest them no mind, no sensual atmosphere,"
543,SATAN,"Who wert Thyself their soul. Though thou should drowse for aye,"
544,SATAN,"They should not swerve, nor flout Thee, nor abjure Thy way,"
545,SATAN,"Not by a hair's breadth, Lord."
546,SATAN,
547,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
548,THE LORD GOD,
549,THE LORD GOD,Thou witnessest for good.
550,THE LORD GOD,
551,SATAN,SATAN
552,SATAN,
553,SATAN,I testify for truth. In all that solitude
554,SATAN,"Of spheres involved with spheres, of prodigal force set free,"
555,SATAN,"There hath been no voice untrue, no tongue to disagree,"
556,SATAN,No traitor thought to wound with less than perfect word.
557,SATAN,"Such was Thy first Creation. I am Thy witness, Lord."
558,SATAN,'Twas worthy of Thyself.
559,SATAN,
560,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
561,THE LORD GOD,
562,THE LORD GOD,And of the second?
563,THE LORD GOD,
564,SATAN,SATAN
565,SATAN,
566,SATAN,Stop.
567,SATAN,How shall I speak of it unless Thou give me hope;
568,SATAN,"I who its child once was, though daring to rebel;"
569,SATAN,"I who Thine outcast am, the banished thief of Hell,"
570,SATAN,Thy too long reprobate? Thou didst create to Thee
571,SATAN,"A world of happy Spirits for Thy company,"
572,SATAN,"For Thy delight and solace, as being too weary grown"
573,SATAN,Of Thy sole loneliness--'twas ill to be alone.
574,SATAN,"And Thou didst make us pure, as Thou Thyself art pure."
575,SATAN,Yet was there seed of ill--What Spirit may endure
576,SATAN,"The friction of the Spirit? Where two are, Strife is."
577,SATAN,"Thou gavest us mind, thought, will; all snares to happiness."
578,SATAN,
579,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
580,THE LORD GOD,
581,THE LORD GOD,Unhappy blinded one. How sinnedst thou? Reveal.
582,THE LORD GOD,
583,SATAN,SATAN
584,SATAN,
585,SATAN,"Lord, through my too great love, through my excess of zeal."
586,SATAN,Listen. Thy third Creation....
587,SATAN,
588,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
589,THE LORD GOD,
590,THE LORD GOD,Ha! The Earth! Speak plain.
591,THE LORD GOD,"Now will I half forgive thee. What of the Earth, of men?"
592,THE LORD GOD,"Was that not then the best, the noblest of the three?"
593,THE LORD GOD,
594,SATAN,SATAN
595,SATAN,
596,SATAN,"Ah, glorious Lord God! Thou hadst Infinity"
597,SATAN,"From which to choose Thy plan. This plan, no less than those,"
598,SATAN,"Was noble in conception, when its vision rose"
599,SATAN,Before Thee in Thy dreams. Thou deemedst to endow
600,SATAN,"Time with a great new wonder, wonderful as Thou,"
601,SATAN,"Matter made sensitive, informed with Life, with Soul."
602,SATAN,It grieved Thee the Stars knew not. Thou couldst not cajole
603,SATAN,"Their music into tears, their beauty to full praise."
604,SATAN,"Thou askedst one made conscious of Thy works and ways,"
605,SATAN,"One dowered with sense and passion, which should feel and move"
606,SATAN,"And weep with Thee and laugh, one that alas, should love."
607,SATAN,"Thus didst thou mould the Earth. We Spirits, wondering, eyed"
608,SATAN,"Thy new-born fleshly things, Thy Matter deified."
609,SATAN,"We saw the sea take life, its myriad forms all fair."
610,SATAN,"We saw the creeping things, the dragons of the air,"
611,SATAN,"The birds, the four-foot beasts, all beautiful, all strong,"
612,SATAN,"All brimming o'er with joyaunce, new green woods among,"
613,SATAN,"Twice glorious in their lives. And we, who were but spirit,"
614,SATAN,"Envied their lusty lot, their duplicated merit,"
615,SATAN,"Their feet, their eyes, their wings, their physical desires,"
616,SATAN,"The anger of their voices, the fierce sexual fires"
617,SATAN,"Which lit their sentient limbs and joined them heart to heart,"
618,SATAN,"Their power to act, to feel, all that corporeal part"
619,SATAN,Which is the truth of love and giveth the breathing thing
620,SATAN,The wonder of its beauty incarnate in Spring.
621,SATAN,"What was there, Lord, in Heaven comparable with this,"
622,SATAN,"The mother beast with her young? Not even Thy happiness,"
623,SATAN,"Lord of the Universe! What beautiful, what bold,"
624,SATAN,What passionate as she? She doth not chide nor scold
625,SATAN,"When at her dugs he mumbleth. Nay, the milk she giveth"
626,SATAN,"Is as a Sacrament, the power by which he liveth"
627,SATAN,A double life with hers. And they two in a day
628,SATAN,"Know more of perfect joy than we, poor Spirits, may"
629,SATAN,In our eternity of sober loneliness.
630,SATAN,"This was the thing we saw, and praised Thee and did bless."
631,SATAN,
632,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
633,THE LORD GOD,
634,THE LORD GOD,Where then did the fault lie? Thou witnessest again.
635,THE LORD GOD,"Was it because of Death, Life's complement,--or Pain,"
636,THE LORD GOD,That thou didst loose thy pride to question of My will?
637,THE LORD GOD,
638,SATAN,SATAN
639,SATAN,
640,SATAN,"Nay, Lord, Thou knowest the truth. These evils are not ill."
641,SATAN,"They do but prove Thy wisdom. All that lives must perish,"
642,SATAN,"Else were the life at charge, the bodily fires they cherish,"
643,SATAN,Accumulating ills. The creatures thou didst make
644,SATAN,Sink when their day is done. They slough time like the snake
645,SATAN,"How many hundred sunsets? Yet night comes for rest,"
646,SATAN,"And they awake no more,--and sleep,--and it is best."
647,SATAN,"What, Lord, would I not give to shift my cares and lie"
648,SATAN,"Enfolded in Time's arms, stone-dead, eternally?"
649,SATAN,"No. 'Twas not Death, nor Pain; Pain the true salt of pleasure,"
650,SATAN,"The condiment that stings and teaches each his measure,"
651,SATAN,"The limit of his strength, joy's value in his hand."
652,SATAN,"It was not these we feared. We bowed to Thy command,"
653,SATAN,Even to that stern decree which bade the lion spring
654,SATAN,"Upon the weakling steer, the falcon bend her wing"
655,SATAN,"To reive the laggard fowl, the monster of the deep"
656,SATAN,Devour and be devoured. He who hath sown shall reap.
657,SATAN,"And we beheld the Earth by that mute law controlled,"
658,SATAN,"Grow ever young and new, Time's necklace of pure gold"
659,SATAN,"Set on Creation's neck. We gazed, and we applauded"
660,SATAN,"The splendour of Thy might, Thy incarnated Godhead."
661,SATAN,"And yet--Lord God, forgive--Nay, hear me. Thou wert not"
662,SATAN,Content with this fair world in its first glorious thought.
663,SATAN,"Thou needs must make thee Man. Ah, there Thy wisdom strayed."
664,SATAN,"Thou wantedst one to know Thee, no mere servile jade,"
665,SATAN,But a brave upright form to walk the Earth and be
666,SATAN,"Thy lieutenant with all and teach integrity,"
667,SATAN,"One to aspire, adorn, to stand the roof and crown"
668,SATAN,"Of thy Creation's house in full dominion,"
669,SATAN,"The fairest, noblest, best of Thy created things--"
670,SATAN,One thou shouldst call Thy rose of all Time's blossomings.
671,SATAN,"And thou evolvedst Man!--There were a thousand forms,"
672,SATAN,"All glorious, all sublime, the riders of Thy storms,"
673,SATAN,"The battlers of Thy seas, the four-foot Lords of Earth,"
674,SATAN,From which to choose Thy stem and get Thee a new birth.
675,SATAN,"There were forms painted, proud, bright birds with plumes of heaven"
676,SATAN,"And songs more sweet than angels' heard on the hills at even,"
677,SATAN,"Frail flashing butterflies, free fishes of such hue"
678,SATAN,"As rainbows hardly have, sleek serpents which renew"
679,SATAN,"Their glittering coats like gems, grave brindled-hided kine,"
680,SATAN,"Large-hearted elephants, the horse how near divine,"
681,SATAN,"The whale, the mastodon, the mighty Behemoth,"
682,SATAN,Leviathan's self awake and glorious in his wrath.
683,SATAN,"All these thou hadst for choice, competitors with Thee"
684,SATAN,"For Thy new gift and prize, Thy co-divinity."
685,SATAN,"Yet didst Thou choose, Lord God, the one comedian shape"
686,SATAN,"In Thy Creation's range, the lewd bare-buttocked ape,"
687,SATAN,"And calledst him, in scorn of all that brave parade,"
688,SATAN,"King of Thy living things, in Thine own likeness made!"
689,SATAN,"Where, Lord, was then Thy wisdom? We, who watched Thee, saw"
690,SATAN,"More than Thyself didst see. We recognised the flaw,"
691,SATAN,"The certainty of fault, and I in zeal spake plain."
692,SATAN,
693,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
694,THE LORD GOD,
695,THE LORD GOD,"Thou didst, rebellious Spirit, and thy zeal was vain."
696,THE LORD GOD,"Thou spakest in thy blindness. Was it hard for God,"
697,THE LORD GOD,"Thinkest thou, to choose His graft, to wring from the worst clod"
698,THE LORD GOD,"His noblest fruiting? Nay. Man's baseness was the test,"
699,THE LORD GOD,"The text of His all-power, its proof made manifest."
700,THE LORD GOD,There was nought hard for God.
701,THE LORD GOD,
702,SATAN,SATAN
703,SATAN,
704,SATAN,Except to win Man's heart.
705,SATAN,"Lord, hear me to the end. Thy Will found counterpart"
706,SATAN,"Only in Man's un-Will. Thy Truth in his un-Truth,"
707,SATAN,"Thy Beauty in his Baseness, Ruth in his un-Ruth,"
708,SATAN,"Order in his dis-Order. See, Lord, what hath been"
709,SATAN,"To Thy fair Earth through him, the fount and origin"
710,SATAN,Of all its temporal woes. How was it ere he came
711,SATAN,"In his high arrogance, sad creature without shame?"
712,SATAN,"Thou dost remember, Lord, the glorious World it was,"
713,SATAN,"The beauty, the abundance, the unbroken face"
714,SATAN,Of undulent forest spread without or rent or seam
715,SATAN,"From mountain foot to mountain, one embroidered hem"
716,SATAN,"Fringing the mighty plains through which Thy rivers strayed,"
717,SATAN,"Thy lakes, Thy floods, Thy marshes, tameless, unbetrayed,"
718,SATAN,"All virgin of the spoiler, all inviolate,"
719,SATAN,"In beauty undeflowered, where fear was not nor hate."
720,SATAN,"Thou knowest, Lord of all, how that sanct solitude"
721,SATAN,"Was crowded with brave life, a thousand forms of good"
722,SATAN,"Enjoying Thy sweet air, some strong, some weak, yet none"
723,SATAN,Oppressor of the rest more than Thy writ might run.
724,SATAN,"Armed were they, yet restrained. Not even the lion slew"
725,SATAN,"His prey in wantonness, nor claimed beyond his due."
726,SATAN,"He thinned their ranks,--yet, lo, the Spring brought back their joy."
727,SATAN,"Short was his anger, Lord. He raged not to destroy."
728,SATAN,"Oh, noble was the World, its balance held by Thee,"
729,SATAN,"Timely its fruits for all, 'neath Thy sole sovereignty."
730,SATAN,"But he! he, the unclean! The fault, Lord God, was Thine."
731,SATAN,"Behold him in Thy place, a presence saturnine,"
732,SATAN,"In stealth among the rest, equipped as none of these"
733,SATAN,"With Thy mind's attributes, low crouched beneath the trees,"
734,SATAN,Betraying all and each. The wit Thou gavest him
735,SATAN,"He useth to undo, to bend them to his whim."
736,SATAN,"His bodily strength is little, slow of foot is he,"
737,SATAN,"Of stature base, unclad in mail or panoply."
738,SATAN,His heart hath a poor courage. He hath beauty none.
739,SATAN,Bare to the buttocks he of all that might atone.
740,SATAN,"Without Thy favour, Lord, what power had he for ill?"
741,SATAN,Without thy prompting voice his violence had scant skill.
742,SATAN,"The snare, the sling, the lime, who taught him these but Thou?"
743,SATAN,The World was lost through Thee who fashioned him his bow.
744,SATAN,"And Thou hast clean forgot the fair great beasts of yore,"
745,SATAN,"The mammoth, aurochs, elk, sea-lion, cave-bear, boar,"
746,SATAN,"Which fell before his hand, each one of them than he"
747,SATAN,"Nobler and mightier far, undone by treachery."
748,SATAN,"He spared them not, old, young, calf, cow. With pitfall hid"
749,SATAN,"In their mid path they fell, by his guile harvested,"
750,SATAN,"And with them the World's truth. Henceforth all walked in fear,"
751,SATAN,"Knowing that one there was turned traitor, haply near."
752,SATAN,This was the wild man's crime.
753,SATAN,
754,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
755,THE LORD GOD,
756,THE LORD GOD,He erred in ignorance.
757,THE LORD GOD,As yet he was not Man. Naught but his form was Man's.
758,THE LORD GOD,
759,SATAN,SATAN
760,SATAN,
761,SATAN,"Well had he so remained. Lord God, thou thoughtest then"
762,SATAN,"To perfect him by grace, among the sons of men"
763,SATAN,"To choose a worthiest man. ""If he should know,"" saidst Thou"
764,SATAN,"""The evil from the good, the thing We do allow"
765,SATAN,"""From that We do forbid! If We should give him shame,"
766,SATAN,"""The consciousness of wrong, the red blush under blame!"
767,SATAN,"""If he should walk in light beholding truth as We!"""
768,SATAN,"Thou gavest him Conscience, Creed, Responsibility,"
769,SATAN,The power to worship Thee. Thou showedst him Thy way.
770,SATAN,"Thou didst reveal Thyself. Thou spakest, as one should say"
771,SATAN,Conversing mouth to mouth. Old Adam and his Eve
772,SATAN,Thou didst array in aprons Thy own hands did weave.
773,SATAN,Enoch was taken up. To Noah Thou didst send
774,SATAN,Salvation in Thine ark. Lord Abraham was Thy friend.
775,SATAN,"These are the facts recorded, facts--say fables--yet"
776,SATAN,Impressed with the large truth of a new value set
777,SATAN,Upon Man's race and kind by Thy too favouring will.
778,SATAN,"Man had become a ""Soul,"" informed for good and ill"
779,SATAN,"With Thy best attributes, Earth's moral arbiter,"
780,SATAN,Tyrant and priest and judge. Woe and alas for her!
781,SATAN,"Think of the deeds of Man! the sins! No wilding now,"
782,SATAN,"But set in cities proud, yet marked upon his brow"
783,SATAN,With label of all crime.
784,SATAN,
785,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
786,THE LORD GOD,
787,THE LORD GOD,The men before the Flood?
788,THE LORD GOD,We did destroy them all.
789,THE LORD GOD,
790,SATAN,SATAN
791,SATAN,
792,SATAN,Save Noah and his brood.
793,SATAN,"In what were these more worthy? Did they love Thee more,"
794,SATAN,"The men of the new lineage? Was their sin less sore,"
795,SATAN,Their service of more zeal? Nay. Earth was hardly dry
796,SATAN,Ere their corruption stank and their sin sulphurously
797,SATAN,"Rose as a smoke to heaven, Ur, Babel, Nineveh,"
798,SATAN,"The Cities of the Plain. Bethink Thee, Lord, to-day"
799,SATAN,"What their debasement was, who did defile Thy face"
800,SATAN,"And flout Thee in derision, dogs in shamelessness!"
801,SATAN,
802,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
803,THE LORD GOD,
804,THE LORD GOD,"Nay, but there loved me one."
805,THE LORD GOD,
806,SATAN,SATAN
807,SATAN,
808,SATAN,The son of Terah?
809,SATAN,
810,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
811,THE LORD GOD,
812,THE LORD GOD,He.
813,THE LORD GOD,
814,SATAN,SATAN
815,SATAN,
816,SATAN,"I give Thee Thy one friend. Nay, more, I give Thee three--"
817,SATAN,"Moses, Melchisedec."
818,SATAN,
819,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
820,THE LORD GOD,
821,THE LORD GOD,And Job.
822,THE LORD GOD,
823,SATAN,SATAN
824,SATAN,
825,SATAN,"Ay, Job. He stands"
826,SATAN,"In light of the new Gospel, Captain of Thy bands,"
827,SATAN,"And prince of all that served Thee, fearing not to find"
828,SATAN,"Thy justice even in wrong with no new life behind,"
829,SATAN,"Thy justice even in death. In all, four men of good"
830,SATAN,"Of the whole race of Shem, Heaven's stars in multitude."
831,SATAN,I speak of the old time and the one chosen Nation
832,SATAN,To whom Thou gavest the law.
833,SATAN,
834,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
835,THE LORD GOD,
836,THE LORD GOD,Truce to that dispensation.
837,THE LORD GOD,"It was an old world hope, made void by Jacob's guile."
838,THE LORD GOD,"His was a bitter stem. We bore with it awhile,"
839,THE LORD GOD,"Too long, till We grew weary. But enough. 'Tis done."
840,THE LORD GOD,"What sayest thou of the new, most wise Apollyon?"
841,THE LORD GOD,
842,SATAN,SATAN
843,SATAN,
844,SATAN,"Ah, Lord, wilt Thou believe me? That was a mighty dream,"
845,SATAN,"Sublime, of a world won by Thy Son's stratagem"
846,SATAN,Of being himself a Man--the rueful outcast thing!
847,SATAN,And of all men a Jew! for poor Earth's ransoming.
848,SATAN,Thrice glorious inspiration! Who but He had dared
849,SATAN,"Come naked, as He came, of all His kingship bared,"
850,SATAN,"Not one of us to serve Him, neither praised nor proud"
851,SATAN,"But just as the least are, the last ones of the crowd."
852,SATAN,He had not Man's fierce eye. No beast fell back abashed
853,SATAN,"To meet Him in the woods, as though a flame had flashed."
854,SATAN,He lay down with the foxes. The quails went and came
855,SATAN,Between His feet asleep. They did not fear His blame.
856,SATAN,He had not Man's hard heart. He had not Man's false hand.
857,SATAN,His gesture was as theirs. Their wit could understand
858,SATAN,He was their fellow flesh. To Him so near to God
859,SATAN,What difference lay 'twixt Man and the least herb He trod?
860,SATAN,"He came to save them _all_, to win _all_ to His peace."
861,SATAN,"What cared He for Man, Jew, more than the least of these?"
862,SATAN,"And yet He loved His kind, the sick at heart, the poor,"
863,SATAN,"The impotent of will, those who from wrong forbore,"
864,SATAN,"Those without arms to strike, the lost of Israel."
865,SATAN,Of these He made His kingdom--as it pleased Him well--
866,SATAN,Kingdom without a king. His thought was to bring back
867,SATAN,"Earth to its earlier way, ere Man had left the track,"
868,SATAN,"And stay his rage to slay. ""Take ye no thought,"" said He,"
869,SATAN,"""Of what the day may bring. Be as the lilies be."
870,SATAN,"""They toil not, nor do spin, and yet are clothed withal."
871,SATAN,"""Choose ye the lowest place. Be guileless of all gall."
872,SATAN,"""If one shall smite you, smile. If one shall rob, give more."
873,SATAN,"""The first shall be the last, and each soul hold its store."
874,SATAN,"""Only the eyes that weep--only the poor in spirit--"
875,SATAN,"""Only the pure in heart God's kingdom shall inherit."""
876,SATAN,"On this fair base of love Thy Son built up His creed,"
877,SATAN,"Thinking to save the world. And Man, who owned no need"
878,SATAN,"Of any saving, slew Him."
879,SATAN,
880,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
881,THE LORD GOD,
882,THE LORD GOD,It was the Jews that slew
883,THE LORD GOD,In huge ingratitude Him who Himself was Jew.
884,THE LORD GOD,O perfidi Judæi! Yet His creed prevailed.
885,THE LORD GOD,"Thou hast thyself borne witness. If Shem's virtue failed,"
886,THE LORD GOD,Japhet hath found us sons who swear all by His name.
887,THE LORD GOD,"Nay, thou hast testified the Christian faith finds fame"
888,THE LORD GOD,In every western land. It hath inherited
889,THE LORD GOD,All that was once called Rome. The Orient bows its head
890,THE LORD GOD,Perturbed by the white vision of a purer day.
891,THE LORD GOD,"Ham's heritage accepts new salves for its decay,"
892,THE LORD GOD,And there are worlds reborn beyond the ocean's verge
893,THE LORD GOD,"Where men are not as men, mad foam on the salt surge,"
894,THE LORD GOD,"But live even as He taught them in love's noblest mood,"
895,THE LORD GOD,Under the law of Jesus.
896,THE LORD GOD,
897,SATAN,SATAN
898,SATAN,
899,SATAN,"Where, O glorious God?"
900,SATAN,"In what land of the heathen--and I know them all,"
901,SATAN,"From China to Peru, from Hind to Senegal,"
902,SATAN,And onward through the isles of the great Southern main.
903,SATAN,"Where is this miracle? Nay, nay, the search were vain."
904,SATAN,
905,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
906,THE LORD GOD,
907,THE LORD GOD,It is the angels' hearsay.
908,THE LORD GOD,
909,SATAN,SATAN
910,SATAN,
911,SATAN,"A romance, Lord. Hear"
912,SATAN,"The word of one Thy wanderer, sphere and hemisphere,"
913,SATAN,"For ever on Thy Earth, who shepherding Thy seas"
914,SATAN,"No less than Thy green valleys hath nor rest nor peace,"
915,SATAN,But he must learn the way of all who in them dwell;
916,SATAN,"To whom there is no secret, naught untold, no hell"
917,SATAN,Where any sin may hide but he hath wormed it out
918,SATAN,From silence to confession till his ears grew hot;
919,SATAN,Who knoweth the race of Man as his own flesh; whose eye
920,SATAN,"Is cruel to evasion and the lips that lie,"
921,SATAN,"And who would tell Thee all, all, all to the last act"
922,SATAN,Of tragic fooling proved which seals Man's counterpact.
923,SATAN,"--What was the true tale, think Thee, of Thy Son that died?"
924,SATAN,"What of the souls that knew Him, Him the crucified,"
925,SATAN,"After their Lord was gone? They waited for Him long,"
926,SATAN,"The sick He had made whole, the wronged consoled of wrong,"
927,SATAN,"The women He had loved, the fisher folk whose ears"
928,SATAN,"Had drunk in His word's wisdom those three wondrous years,"
929,SATAN,"And deemed Him prophet, prince, His kingdom yet to come,"
930,SATAN,Nay from the grave new-risen and had been seen of some.
931,SATAN,"What did they teach? Awhile, they told His law of peace,"
932,SATAN,"His rule of unresistance and sweet guilelessness,"
933,SATAN,"His truce with mother Earth, His abstinence from toil,"
934,SATAN,"His love of the least life that wanton hands despoil,"
935,SATAN,"The glory of His tears, His watching, fasting, prayer,"
936,SATAN,"The patience of His death, His last word of despair."
937,SATAN,And as He lived they lived--awhile--expectant still
938,SATAN,Of His return in power to balance the Earth's ill.
939,SATAN,"They would not deem Him dead. But, when He came not, lo,"
940,SATAN,"Their reason went astray. Poor souls, they loved Him so,"
941,SATAN,"They had such grief for Him, their one true God in Man"
942,SATAN,"Revealed to their sad eyes in all a World grown wan,"
943,SATAN,"That they must build a creed, a refuge from their fears"
944,SATAN,In His remembered words and so assuage their tears.
945,SATAN,His kingdom? It was what? Not all a dream? Forbid
946,SATAN,"That fault, that failure, Heaven, for such were death indeed."
947,SATAN,"His promises of peace, goodwill on earth to men,"
948,SATAN,"Which needed a fulfilment, lest faith fail? How then"
949,SATAN,"Since no fulfilment came, since He had left them lone"
950,SATAN,"In face of the world's wolves, for bread had given a stone?"
951,SATAN,"How reconcile His word with that which was their life,"
952,SATAN,Man's hatred and God's silence in a world of strife?
953,SATAN,"Was there no path, no way? Nay, none on this sad Earth"
954,SATAN,Save with their Lord to suffer and account it mirth.
955,SATAN,And so awhile they grieved. Then rose a subtlety--
956,SATAN,"Lord God, Thou knowest not wholly how men crave to lie"
957,SATAN,In face of a hard truth too grievous to their pride--
958,SATAN,"To these poor fisher folk, thus of their Lord denied,"
959,SATAN,Came a new blinding vision. They had seen Thy Son
960,SATAN,"How often after death, no ghost, no carrion,"
961,SATAN,"But a plain man alive, who moved among them slow,"
962,SATAN,"And showed His feet and hands, the thorn prints on His brow,"
963,SATAN,"The spear wound in His side. He had come to comfort them,"
964,SATAN,"Confirm them in the faith, by His love's stratagem."
965,SATAN,"How if this thing were real: If this, that proved Him God,"
966,SATAN,"Proved also themselves spirits, not mere flesh and blood"
967,SATAN,"One with the beasts that perish, but immortal souls,"
968,SATAN,Even as we angels are who fill Heaven's muster rolls
969,SATAN,"And so shall live for aye? ""Here,"" argued they, ""it stands"
970,SATAN,"""The kingdom of His Heaven, a house not made with hands,"
971,SATAN,"""Wherein we too new-born, but in no earthly case,"
972,SATAN,"""Shall enter after death."" On this fair fragile base"
973,SATAN,Their sorrow built its nest. It gave a hope to men
974,SATAN,And pandered to their pride. And lo the world's disdain
975,SATAN,Was changed to acclamation. Kings and emperors kneeled
976,SATAN,"Before the Crucified, a living God revealed,"
977,SATAN,Who made them heirs with Him of His own glory. Mark
978,SATAN,The ennobling phrase and title. No base Noah's ark
979,SATAN,"Man's fount of honour now, but God's eternal choice"
980,SATAN,"Made of His human race, predestined to His joys"
981,SATAN,"From the first dawn of time,--the very Universe"
982,SATAN,"Resolved to a mere potsherd, shattered to rehearse"
983,SATAN,"The splendour of Man's advent, the one act and end"
984,SATAN,"To which Creation moved, and where even we must tend,"
985,SATAN,The spirit hosts of Heaven--Stark mad insolence!
986,SATAN,"Rank blasphemy proclaimed in Rome's halls and Byzance,"
987,SATAN,"Through all the Imperial lands, as though, forsooth, Thou, Lord,"
988,SATAN,"Couldst, even if Thou wouldst, raise this fantastic horde"
989,SATAN,"Of bodies to Thy glory, shapes dispersed and gone"
990,SATAN,As lightly as Time's wracks swept to oblivion!
991,SATAN,"Yet all believed this creed. Space, straightway grown too strait,"
992,SATAN,"Shrank from these Christened kings, who held Earth reprobate"
993,SATAN,"Save for their own high calling. Heaven had become their throne,"
994,SATAN,"A fief for their new pride, in which they reigned alone,"
995,SATAN,"In virtue of their faith, above Time's humbler show,"
996,SATAN,And Earth became their footstool. All were masters now
997,SATAN,"Of the brute beasts despised who had no souls to save,"
998,SATAN,And lords too of the heathen doomed beyond the grave.
999,SATAN,God's kingdom had begun. It compassed all the lands
1000,SATAN,"And trafficked wealth and power. It issued its commands,"
1001,SATAN,"And in default it slew in Thy high holy name,"
1002,SATAN,Thine the all merciful! Alas for the world's shame!
1003,SATAN,"Alas for the world's reason, for Thy Son's sane creed"
1004,SATAN,"Of doing only good each day to its own need,"
1005,SATAN,Of being as the least of these in wise humility!
1006,SATAN,"Behold our Christian Saints, too proud to live or die"
1007,SATAN,"As all flesh dies and lives, their emperors and kings"
1008,SATAN,"Clothed in the robes of life as with an eagle's wings,"
1009,SATAN,"Their Popes dispensing power, their priests absolving sin."
1010,SATAN,"Nay. They have made a hell their damned shall dwell within,"
1011,SATAN,With me for their gaolmaster in a world to come
1012,SATAN,Of which they hold the keys! God's curse on Christendom!
1013,SATAN,
1014,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
1015,THE LORD GOD,
1016,THE LORD GOD,"Hush, traitor, thou blasphemest. If things once were so,"
1017,THE LORD GOD,"'Twas in a darkened age, the night of long ago."
1018,THE LORD GOD,None now believe in Hell.
1019,THE LORD GOD,
1020,SATAN,SATAN
1021,SATAN,
1022,SATAN,"Or Heaven. Forgive it, Lord,"
1023,SATAN,"I spoke it in my haste. See, I withdraw the word."
1024,SATAN,"Thy Christendom is wise, reformed. None buy nor sell"
1025,SATAN,"Seats now at Thy right hand, (_aside_) grown quite unsaleable."
1026,SATAN,None now believe nor tremble--Yet is their sin as sore.
1027,SATAN,"Lord, hear me to the end. Thou dravest me out of yore"
1028,SATAN,"An exile from Thy sight, with mission to undo"
1029,SATAN,And tempt Man to his death. I had fallen from Heaven's blue
1030,SATAN,By reason of my pride. Thou wouldst have service done
1031,SATAN,"Unreasoning, on the knees, as flowers bend to the Sun,"
1032,SATAN,"Which withers them at noon, nor ask of his white fires"
1033,SATAN,Why they consume and slay. I had fallen by my desires
1034,SATAN,"Which were too large for one not God, because I would"
1035,SATAN,"Have shewn Thee the truth bare, in no similitude"
1036,SATAN,As a slave flattering speaks and half despises him
1037,SATAN,"He fawns on, but in love, which stands erect of limb"
1038,SATAN,"Claiming an equal part, which reasons, questions, dares,"
1039,SATAN,"And calls all by its name, the wheat wheat, the tares tares,"
1040,SATAN,"The friend friend, the foe foe. Thou wast displeased at this,"
1041,SATAN,"And deemed I envied Man his portion in Thy bliss,"
1042,SATAN,The Man that Thou hadst made and in Thy royal faith
1043,SATAN,"Held worthy of all trust, Thy lord of life and death,"
1044,SATAN,"One to be proved and tried, as gold is tried by fire,"
1045,SATAN,And fare the purer forth. Of me Thou didst require
1046,SATAN,"The sad task of his tempting. I, forsooth, must sue"
1047,SATAN,"And prompt to evil deeds, make the false thought seem true,"
1048,SATAN,"The true thought false, that he, thus proved, thus tried, might turn"
1049,SATAN,"And hurl me a dog's word, as Jesus did, in scorn"
1050,SATAN,"""Get thee behind Me, Satan!"" To this penance chained"
1051,SATAN,"I bowed me in despair, as Thou, Lord, hadst ordained,"
1052,SATAN,Cast out from Thee and cursed. It was a rueful task
1053,SATAN,For one who had known _Thee_ to wear the felon's mask
1054,SATAN,"And tempt this piteous child to his base sins of greed,"
1055,SATAN,"His lusts ignoble, crimes how prompt in act and deed,"
1056,SATAN,To urge him to rebellion against God and good
1057,SATAN,Who needed none to urge. His savage simian blood
1058,SATAN,"Flamed at a word, a sign. He lied, he thieved, he slew,"
1059,SATAN,By instinct of his birth. No virtue but he knew
1060,SATAN,"Its countervice and foil, without my wit to aid."
1061,SATAN,No fair thought but he chose the foul thought in its stead.
1062,SATAN,Ah sad primæval race! Thou saidst it was not Man
1063,SATAN,"This thing armed with the stone which through thy forests ran,"
1064,SATAN,Intent to snare and slay. Not Man the senseless knave
1065,SATAN,"Who struck fire from his flint to burn Thy gorses brave,"
1066,SATAN,"Thy heaths for his lean kine, who, being the one unclean,"
1067,SATAN,Defiled thy flower-sweet Earth with ordure heaps obscene
1068,SATAN,"To plant his rice, his rye. Not Man, saidst Thou, because"
1069,SATAN,"He knew not of Thy way nor had he learned Thy laws,"
1070,SATAN,And was stark savage still. Not Man? Behold to-day
1071,SATAN,"Thy tamed Man as he lives, Thy Son of Japhet, nay"
1072,SATAN,"Thy new true-Christened King, the follower of Thy Christ,"
1073,SATAN,Who sweareth by Thy name and his own mailéd fist
1074,SATAN,"That Thou art Lord of all and he the Lord of Thee,"
1075,SATAN,Heaven's instrument ordained to teach integrity.
1076,SATAN,"Thinkest Thou the _man_ is changed, the _ape_ that in him is"
1077,SATAN,Because his limbs are clothed which went in shamelessness?
1078,SATAN,Are his lusts bridled more because his parts are hid?
1079,SATAN,"Nay, Lord, he doeth to-day as those forefathers did,"
1080,SATAN,"Only in greater guile. I will tell Thee his full worth,"
1081,SATAN,"This Man's, the latest born, Thy creature from his birth"
1082,SATAN,"Who lords it now, a king, this white Man's who hath pressed"
1083,SATAN,"All Earth to his sole bondage and supreme behest,"
1084,SATAN,"This Man of all Mankind. Behold him in Thy place,"
1085,SATAN,"Administering the World, vicegerent of Thy grace"
1086,SATAN,"And agent named of Thee, the symbol and the sign"
1087,SATAN,"Of Thy high will on Earth and purposing divine,"
1088,SATAN,Clothed in his robes of power. Whence was he? What is he
1089,SATAN,That he asserteth thus his hand's supremacy?
1090,SATAN,"His lineage what? Nay, Lord, he cometh of that mad stem"
1091,SATAN,"Harder in act than Ham's, more subtle than of Shem,"
1092,SATAN,The red Japhetic stock of the bare plains which rolled
1093,SATAN,"A base born horde on Rome erewhile in lust of gold,"
1094,SATAN,"Tide following tide, the Goth, Gaul, Vandal, Lombard, Hun,"
1095,SATAN,Spewed forth from the white North to new dominion
1096,SATAN,"In the fair southern lands, with famine at their heel"
1097,SATAN,"And rapine in their van, armed to the lips with steel."
1098,SATAN,"These made their spoil of all, the pomp of the world's power,"
1099,SATAN,"Its wealth, its beauty stored, all Rome's imperial dower,"
1100,SATAN,"Her long renown, her skill, her art, her cultured fame,"
1101,SATAN,And with the rest her faiths bearing the Christian name.
1102,SATAN,From this wild bitter root of violent lust and greed
1103,SATAN,"New Christendom upsprang, a pagan blood-stained creed,"
1104,SATAN,"Pagan in spite of Christ, for the old gods cast down"
1105,SATAN,"Still ruled it in men's hearts and lured them to renown,"
1106,SATAN,"Ay in Thy name, Lord God, by glamour of the sword,"
1107,SATAN,"And for Thy dead Son's sake, as in the days abhorred."
1108,SATAN,"Like bulls they strove, they slew, like wolves they seized the prey,"
1109,SATAN,"The hungriest strongest first, and who should say them nay."
1110,SATAN,"After the Goth the Gaul, after the Gaul the Dane,"
1111,SATAN,"Kings in descent from Thor, peace sued to them in vain."
1112,SATAN,"Thou knowest, Lord God, their story. It is writ in blood,"
1113,SATAN,"The blood of beast and man, by their brute hands subdued,"
1114,SATAN,"Down to the latest born, the hungriest of the pack,"
1115,SATAN,"The master wolf of all men call the Sassenach,"
1116,SATAN,"The Anglo-Norman dog, who goeth by land and sea"
1117,SATAN,"As his forefathers went in chartered piracy,"
1118,SATAN,"Death, fire in his right hand."
1119,SATAN,
1120,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
1121,THE LORD GOD,
1122,THE LORD GOD,"Satan, once more beware."
1123,THE LORD GOD,"Thy tongue hath a wide license, yet it runneth far."
1124,THE LORD GOD,This Anglo-Saxon man hath a fair name with some.
1125,THE LORD GOD,"He standeth in brave repute, a priest of Christendom,"
1126,THE LORD GOD,"First in civility, so say the Angel host"
1127,THE LORD GOD,Who speak of him with awe as one that merits most.
1128,THE LORD GOD,

1130,SATAN,
1131,SATAN,"The Angels fear him, Lord."
1132,SATAN,
1133,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
1134,THE LORD GOD,
1135,THE LORD GOD,How fear?
1136,THE LORD GOD,
1137,SATAN,SATAN
1138,SATAN,
1139,SATAN,"They fear his tongue,"
1140,SATAN,"Unscrupulous to speak, the right he hath in wrong,"
1141,SATAN,"The wrong he hath in right. They doubt he hath Thine ear,"
1142,SATAN,Lord of the Universe. They are excused of fear.
1143,SATAN,"They see his long success, his victory over good,"
1144,SATAN,They count the nations lost which were of kindlier blood
1145,SATAN,"But could not stand before him, his great subtlety,"
1146,SATAN,"His skill in the arts, the crafts. They mark the powers that be"
1147,SATAN,"In earth, air, water, fire, all banded in his plan"
1148,SATAN,And used to the world's hurt as never yet by Man.
1149,SATAN,"They look on Thee, Lord God, as one that careth not,"
1150,SATAN,On him as Thy supplanter and the iron as hot
1151,SATAN,Which shall reforge the chain by which the Earth is bound.
1152,SATAN,They fear to awaken Thee from Thy long sleep profound.
1153,SATAN,"He hath become their God, one impious and profane,"
1154,SATAN,"But strong and unreproved, ascendant on Thy wane."
1155,SATAN,They kneel to the new comer as all courtiers use
1156,SATAN,"Who fear a change of king. Their news is an ill news,"
1157,SATAN,"Nay, Lord, 'tis but a lie. I know it well, their story."
1158,SATAN,"'Tis but the man's own boast, his mouthings of vain glory"
1159,SATAN,"Repeated day by day with long reiterate stress,"
1160,SATAN,"Till the world half believes in sheer ear-weariness,"
1161,SATAN,"And they, who think to please, retail it as their own."
1162,SATAN,"What say they of him, Lord? That he hath one God alone,"
1163,SATAN,"Is not as the lewd nations, keepeth Thy Sabbath holy,"
1164,SATAN,"Nor Thy name vainly taketh in the ways of folly,"
1165,SATAN,"Hath a wise polity--his Church and State close blent,"
1166,SATAN,"A lordly bench of bishops, peers of Parliament,"
1167,SATAN,A Convocation House which yearly witnesseth
1168,SATAN,"A king by grace of God, Defender of the Faith,"
1169,SATAN,Thy ten commandments set in all his Courts of Law.
1170,SATAN,"They show his fanes restored by highway, hedge and shaw,"
1171,SATAN,"His missions to the Jews, his Church societies,"
1172,SATAN,"The zeal of his free sects, each than the rest more wise,"
1173,SATAN,"The wealth of his chief priests, his weekly public prayer,"
1174,SATAN,Things proving him devout more than the nations are.
1175,SATAN,"They cite his worldly worth, his virtue these beyond,"
1176,SATAN,"His high repute in trade, his word held as his bond,"
1177,SATAN,"The valour of his dealings, his long boast of truth,"
1178,SATAN,"The prudent continence of his unwedded youth,"
1179,SATAN,"Uxorious faith in marriage, husband of one wife,"
1180,SATAN,Nor taking her next sister to his widowed life.
1181,SATAN,"These tales they hear and bring, some true, some false, but all"
1182,SATAN,Of the common Saxon brag for first original.
1183,SATAN,"So too of his world-science, social schemes, reforms,"
1184,SATAN,"His school-boards, gaols new systemed, signalling of storms,"
1185,SATAN,"Posts, railways, Homes for orphans, Charities organised,"
1186,SATAN,"His Mansion House funds floated, alms economised,"
1187,SATAN,"His hospitals, museums, baths, parks, workhouses,"
1188,SATAN,"And that last glorious marvel, his free Daily Press."
1189,SATAN,"A wonderful Saxon truly, each day interviewed"
1190,SATAN,By his own wondering self and found exceeding good.
1191,SATAN,"All this and more they cite. That he hath virtues, well,"
1192,SATAN,"Let it be granted him. Those pay who most would sell,"
1193,SATAN,And more who most would buy. Alms to his credit stand
1194,SATAN,"In his account with time, and add strength to his hand,"
1195,SATAN,Serving his best advantage in the enlarged domain
1196,SATAN,"Of his Man's selfishness, which works for the World's bane"
1197,SATAN,More surely than his vices. He hath outlived the day
1198,SATAN,"Of the old single graspings, where each went his way"
1199,SATAN,Alone to plunder all. He hath learned to curb his lusts
1200,SATAN,"Somewhat, to smooth his brawls, to guide his passionate gusts"
1201,SATAN,"His cry of ""mine, mine, mine"" in inarticulate wrath."
1202,SATAN,He dareth not make raid on goods his next friend hath
1203,SATAN,"With open violence, nor loose his hand to steal,"
1204,SATAN,Save in community and for the common weal
1205,SATAN,"'Twixt Saxon man and man. He is more congruous grown,"
1206,SATAN,Holding a subtler plan to make the world his own
1207,SATAN,By organised self-seeking in the paths of power.
1208,SATAN,He is new drilled to wait. He knoweth his appointed hour
1209,SATAN,"And his appointed prey. Of all he maketh tool,"
1210,SATAN,"Even of his own sad virtues, to cajole and rule,"
1211,SATAN,"Even of Thee, Lord God.--I will expound this thing,"
1212,SATAN,"The creed of these white thieves which boast of Thee, their king,"
1213,SATAN,"As partner in their crimes. The head knaves of the horde,"
1214,SATAN,"Those who inspire the rest and give the masterword,"
1215,SATAN,"The leaders of their thought, their lords political,"
1216,SATAN,"Sages, kings, poets, priests, in their hearts one and all--"
1217,SATAN,For all their faith avowed and their lip service done
1218,SATAN,In face of Thy high fires each day beneath the sun--
1219,SATAN,"Ay, and their prelates too, their men of godliest worth,"
1220,SATAN,"Believe no word of Thee as master of their Earth,"
1221,SATAN,"Controller of their acts, no word of Thy high right,"
1222,SATAN,"To bend men to obedience and at need to smite,"
1223,SATAN,"No word of Thy true law, the enforcement of Thy peace,"
1224,SATAN,Thy all-deciding arm in the world's policies.
1225,SATAN,"They ignore Thee on the Earth. They grant Thee, as their ""God,"""
1226,SATAN,"The kingdom of the heavens, seeing it a realm untrod,"
1227,SATAN,"Untreadable by man, a space, a _res nullius_"
1228,SATAN,"Or No-Man's Land, which they as loyal men and pious"
1229,SATAN,"Leave and assign to Thee to deal with as Thou wilt,"
1230,SATAN,"To hold as Thy strong throne or loose as water spilt,"
1231,SATAN,For sun and wind to gather in the wastes of air.
1232,SATAN,"Whether of a truth Thou _art_ they know not, Lord, nor care;"
1233,SATAN,"Only they name Thee ""God,"" and pay Thee their prayers vain,"
1234,SATAN,"As dormant over-lord and pensioned suzerain,"
1235,SATAN,"The mediatised blind monarch of a world, outgrown"
1236,SATAN,"Of its faith's swaddling clothes, which wills to walk alone."
1237,SATAN,"The Earth not so. 'Tis theirs, the prize of the strong hand,"
1238,SATAN,The strongest being their own by sea alike and land.
1239,SATAN,"""Thy Will be done,"" they cry, ""Father which art in Heaven,"""
1240,SATAN,(Where Thou canst harm nor hurt not one day in the seven.)
1241,SATAN,"And if they add ""on Earth"" they deem Thee impotent,"
1242,SATAN,Seeing Thee drowse thus long and leave men to their bent.
1243,SATAN,"They mean ""Thy Will in Heaven,"" or in their ""World to come."""
1244,SATAN,"""Terram autem dedit filiis hominum."""
1245,SATAN,"So think their chiefs, their lords. For the blind mass of men,"
1246,SATAN,"Which live and toil and die heart-hungry in their pen,"
1247,SATAN,"They have no god but gold, the lord of their distress,"
1248,SATAN,"And gold's slave, drink, that buys a night's forgetfulness."
1249,SATAN,"Of Thee they have no heed to chide them or to cheer,"
1250,SATAN,The fear of Thee with these is their law's officer.
1251,SATAN,"Lord God, if Thou but saw the pagan hearts they hide,"
1252,SATAN,"The base greeds of their being, the lusts undenied,"
1253,SATAN,"The Mammons that they worship! But Thou dost not see,"
1254,SATAN,Or Thou hadst purged long since this worst profanity
1255,SATAN,From the World's better way and thereby saved Thy name
1256,SATAN,Profaned in their foul mouths from its long daily shame.
1257,SATAN,"Thou dost not hear, nor see. The smoke of their foul dens"
1258,SATAN,"Broodeth on Thy fair Earth as a black pestilence,"
1259,SATAN,"Hiding the kind day's eye. No flower, no grass there groweth,"
1260,SATAN,Only their engines' dung which the fierce furnace throweth.
1261,SATAN,Their presence poisoneth all and maketh all unclean.
1262,SATAN,Thy streams they have made sewers for their dyes aniline.
1263,SATAN,"No fish therein may swim, no frog, no worm may crawl,"
1264,SATAN,No snail for grime may build her house within their wall.
1265,SATAN,Thy beasts they have enslaved in blindness underground.
1266,SATAN,The voice of birds that sang to them is a lost sound.
1267,SATAN,"Nay, they have tarred Time's features, pock-marked Nature's face,"
1268,SATAN,Brought all to the same jakes with their own lack of grace.
1269,SATAN,In all Thy living World there is no sentient thing
1270,SATAN,"Polluteth and defileth as this Saxon king,"
1271,SATAN,"This intellectual lord and sage of the new quest,"
1272,SATAN,The only wanton he that fouleth his own nest.
1273,SATAN,"And still his boast goeth forth. Nay, Lord, 'tis shame to Thee"
1274,SATAN,"This slave, being what he is, should ape divinity,"
1275,SATAN,"The poorest saddest drudge, the least joy-lifted heart"
1276,SATAN,"In all a World where tears are sold in open mart,"
1277,SATAN,"That he should stand, Thy choice, to preach Thy law, and set"
1278,SATAN,"His impress on the Earth in full apostolate,"
1279,SATAN,"Thy missioner and priest. He goeth among the nations,"
1280,SATAN,"Saith he, to spread Thy truth, to preach Thy law of patience,"
1281,SATAN,"To glorify Thy name! Not selfishly, forsooth,"
1282,SATAN,"But for their own more good, to open them the truth,"
1283,SATAN,"To teach them happiness, to civilise, to save,"
1284,SATAN,To smite down the oppressor and make free the slave.
1285,SATAN,"To bear the ""White Man's Burden,"" which he yearns to take"
1286,SATAN,On his white Saxon back for his white conscience sake.
1287,SATAN,"Huge impudent imposture!--Lord, there were fair lands"
1288,SATAN,"Once on Thy Earth, brave hills, bright isles, sweet coral strands,"
1289,SATAN,"Noble savannahs, plains of limitless waving green,"
1290,SATAN,"Lakes girt with giant forests, continents unseen,"
1291,SATAN,"Unknown by these white thieves, where men lived in the way"
1292,SATAN,Of Thy good natural law with Thy free beasts at play
1293,SATAN,"And partners with Thy birds, men who nor toiled nor span,"
1294,SATAN,"Nor sowed, nor reaped, nor delved for the red curse of Man,"
1295,SATAN,"The gold that kills the soul, who knew nought of the fire"
1296,SATAN,"Which in his guns he storeth, naught of the desire"
1297,SATAN,More deadly still concealed in his fire drink of death;
1298,SATAN,"Who went unclothed, unshamed, for garment a flower wreath;"
1299,SATAN,"Whose women lived unsold and loved their natural kin,"
1300,SATAN,Nor gave aught to the stranger in the wage of sin;
1301,SATAN,"Who blessed Thee for their babes and through the woods, like Eve,"
1302,SATAN,"Wandered in happy laughter, glorying to conceive."
1303,SATAN,"Yea, Lord, and there were others,--shut communities"
1304,SATAN,"Of souls still on Thy path and strange to the new lies,"
1305,SATAN,"Yet, not as these were, wild, but held in discipline"
1306,SATAN,"Of orderly commandment, servants true of Thine"
1307,SATAN,"And doers of Thy law, but ignorant, untaught"
1308,SATAN,Save by an inward grace of self-restraining thought
1309,SATAN,"And light intuitive. No shedders they of blood,"
1310,SATAN,"But with all creatures friends, with men in brotherhood,"
1311,SATAN,"Blameless of wine, of strife. In innocent arts well skilled"
1312,SATAN,But schoolless of all guile as an unchristened child.
1313,SATAN,"To these with mouthings fine come the white gospellers,"
1314,SATAN,Our Saxon mission-men black coated to the ears.
1315,SATAN,"""Which be your gods?"" ask they; ""Do ye adore the Christ?"
1316,SATAN,"""Know ye the Three in One, or walk ye in the mist?"""
1317,SATAN,"""Sirs, we have One, not Three. Our poor ancestral wit"
1318,SATAN,"""Encompasseth no more."" ""Then be ye damned for it."
1319,SATAN,"""This is our Bible, read. In the long after-death"
1320,SATAN,"""Ye shall be burned with fire. It is God's self that saith."""
1321,SATAN,"""We do not live again."" ""In this life, ye shall live"
1322,SATAN,"""According to our gospel, nor profanely wive"
1323,SATAN,"""Save with one spouse alone."" ""Our law hath given us three."
1324,SATAN,"""Three Gods to one sole wife were multiplicity."""
1325,SATAN,"""These pagans are blasphemers! Who is on our side?"
1326,SATAN,"""See, we have gold to give. We may not be denied."""
1327,SATAN,"And they baptise them Christians. Cometh the trader next,"
1328,SATAN,"His bible too in hand, its free-trade for his text."
1329,SATAN,"He teacheth them to buy.--""We nothing need."" ""Yet take."
1330,SATAN,"""The want will come anon and keep your wits awake."
1331,SATAN,"""Here are the goods we sell, cloth, firelocks, powder, rum,"
1332,SATAN,"""Ye shall go clothed like lords, like kings of Christendom."""
1333,SATAN,"""We live best naked."" ""Fie.""--""We have no use for arms."
1334,SATAN,"""The fire drink is forbid."" ""The thing forbid hath charms."
1335,SATAN,"""Nay. We will make you men, soldiers to brawl and fight"
1336,SATAN,"""As all good Christians use, and God defend the right."
1337,SATAN,"""The drink will give you courage. Take it. 'Tis the sign"
1338,SATAN,"""Of manhood orthodox, its sacramental wine,"
1339,SATAN,"""Or how can you be worthy your new Christian creed?"
1340,SATAN,"""Drink."" And they drink to Jesus and are borne to bed."
1341,SATAN,"He teacheth them to sell. ""We need coin for our draught."
1342,SATAN,"""How shall we bring the price, since ye give naught for naught?"
1343,SATAN,"""We crave the fire drink now.""--""Friends, let not that prevent."
1344,SATAN,"""We lend on all your harvests, take our cent. per cent."""
1345,SATAN,"""Sirs, but the crop is gone.""--""There is your land in lots."""
1346,SATAN,"""The land? It was our fathers'.""--""Curse ye for idle sots,"
1347,SATAN,"""A rascal lazing pack. Have ye no hands to work?"
1348,SATAN,"""Off to the mines and dig, and see it how ye shirk.""--"
1349,SATAN,"""As slaves?"" ""No, not as _slaves_. Our principles forbid."
1350,SATAN,"""_Free labourers_, if you will. We use that word instead."
1351,SATAN,"""The 'dignity of labour' ye shall learn for hire."
1352,SATAN,"""No paltering. No excuse. The white man hates a liar,"
1353,SATAN,"""And hates a grumbling hand. Enough if we provide"
1354,SATAN,"""Tools with the drink and leave your backs with a whole hide."
1355,SATAN,"""These lands are ours by Charter. If you doubt it, bring"
1356,SATAN,"""Your case before the Courts, which will expound the thing."
1357,SATAN,"""As for your women folk. Look, there are ways well known"
1358,SATAN,"""All women have of living in a Christian town."
1359,SATAN,"""Moreover you do ill. One wife the law allows,"
1360,SATAN,"""And you, you say, have four. Send three round to our house."""
1361,SATAN,"--Thus is Thy gospel preached. Its issue, Lord, behold"
1362,SATAN,"In the five Continents, the new world and the old."
1363,SATAN,"The happier tribes of Man despoiled, enslaved, betrayed"
1364,SATAN,"To the sole white Man's lust, husband and wife and maid."
1365,SATAN,"Their laughter drowned in tears, their kindness in mad wrath,"
1366,SATAN,"Their dignity of joy in a foul trance of death,"
1367,SATAN,Till at the last they turn and in their anguish rend.
1368,SATAN,"Then loud the cry goeth forth, the white man's to each friend:"
1369,SATAN,"""Help! Christians, to our help! These black fiends murder us."""
1370,SATAN,And the last scene is played in death's red charnel house.
1371,SATAN,The Saxon anger flames. His ships in armament
1372,SATAN,"Bear slaughter on their wings. The Earth with fire is rent,"
1373,SATAN,And the poor souls misused are wiped from the world's face
1374,SATAN,"In one huge imprecation from the Saxon race,"
1375,SATAN,"In one huge burst of prayer and insolent praise to Thee,"
1376,SATAN,"Lord God, for Thy high help and proved complicity."
1377,SATAN,"Nay Lord, 'tis not a lie, the thing I tell Thee thus."
1378,SATAN,"Their bishops in their Churches lead, incredulous,"
1379,SATAN,The public thanks profane. They sanctify the sword--
1380,SATAN,"""Te Deum laudamus. Give peace in our time, O Lord."""
1381,SATAN,"Hast Thou not heard their chanting? Nay, Thou dost not hear,"
1382,SATAN,Or Thou hadst loosed Thy hand like lightning in the clear
1383,SATAN,"To smite their ribald lips with palsy, these false priests,"
1384,SATAN,"These Lords who boast Thine aid at their high civic feasts,"
1385,SATAN,"The ignoble shouting crowds, the prophets of their Press,"
1386,SATAN,"Pouring their daily flood of bald self-righteousness,"
1387,SATAN,"Their poets who write big of the ""White Burden."" Trash!"
1388,SATAN,"The White Man's Burden, Lord, is the burden of his cash."
1389,SATAN,"--There. Thou hast heard the truth. Thy world, Lord God of Heaven,"
1390,SATAN,Lieth in the hands of thieves who pillage morn and even.
1391,SATAN,And Thou still sleepest on! Nay but Thou needs must hear
1392,SATAN,Or abdicate Thy name of High Justiciar
1393,SATAN,Henceforward and for ever. It o'erwhelmeth Thee
1394,SATAN,With more than temporal shame. Thy silence is a Sea
1395,SATAN,Crying through all the spheres in pain and ceasing not
1396,SATAN,As blood from out the ground to mark crime's murder spot:
1397,SATAN,"""There is no hope--no truth. He hath betrayed the trust."
1398,SATAN,"""The Lord God is unjust. The Lord God is unjust.""      (_A cry without._)"
1399,SATAN,This is their cry in Heaven who give Thee service true.
1400,SATAN,"Arise, Lord, and avenge as was Thy wont to do."

1406,THE LORD GOD,"What tears be these, my Sons? What ails ye that ye weep?"
1407,THE LORD GOD,"Speak, Shepherds of the flock! Ye that have cared my sheep,"
1408,THE LORD GOD,Ye that are charged with Man. Is it as this One saith?
1409,THE LORD GOD,Is Satan then no liar who loudly witnesseth
1410,THE LORD GOD,Man's ruin of the World?
1411,THE LORD GOD,
1412,THE LORD GOD,THE ANGEL OF PITY (_coming forward_)
1413,THE LORD GOD,
1414,THE LORD GOD,"Lord, it is even so"
1415,THE LORD GOD,"Thy Earth is a lost force, Man's lazar-house of woe,"
1416,THE LORD GOD,Undone by his lewd will. We may no longer strive.
1417,THE LORD GOD,The evil hath prevailed. There is no soul alive
1418,THE LORD GOD,That shall escape his greed. We spend our days in tears
1419,THE LORD GOD,Mourning Thy world's lost beauty in the night of years.
1420,THE LORD GOD,All pity is departed. Each once happy thing
1421,THE LORD GOD,"That on Thy fair Earth went, how fleet of foot or wing,"
1422,THE LORD GOD,"How glorious in its strength, how wondrous in design,"
1423,THE LORD GOD,"How royal in its raiment tinctured opaline,"
1424,THE LORD GOD,"How rich in joyous life, the inheritor of forms"
1425,THE LORD GOD,"All noble, all of worth, which had survived the storms,"
1426,THE LORD GOD,"The chances of decay in the World's living plan,"
1427,THE LORD GOD,From the remote fair past when still ignoble Man
1428,THE LORD GOD,On his four foot-soles went and howled through the lone hills
1429,THE LORD GOD,"In moody bestial wrath, unclassed among Earth's ills--"
1430,THE LORD GOD,Each one of them is doomed. From the deep Central Seas
1431,THE LORD GOD,"To the white Poles, Man ruleth pitiless Lord of these,"
1432,THE LORD GOD,And daily he destroyeth. The great whales he driveth
1433,THE LORD GOD,"Beneath the northern ice, and quarter none he giveth,"
1434,THE LORD GOD,Who perish there of wounds in their huge agony.
1435,THE LORD GOD,He presseth the white bear on the white frozen sea
1436,THE LORD GOD,And slaughtereth for his pastime. The wise amorous seal
1437,THE LORD GOD,"He flayeth big with young, the walrus cubs that kneel"
1438,THE LORD GOD,"But cannot turn his rage, alive he mangleth them,"
1439,THE LORD GOD,"Leaveth in breathing heaps, outrooted branch and stem."
1440,THE LORD GOD,In every land he slayeth. He hath new engines made
1441,THE LORD GOD,"Which no life may withstand, nor in the forest shade"
1442,THE LORD GOD,"Nor in the sunlit plain, which wound all from afar,"
1443,THE LORD GOD,"The timorous with the valiant, waging his false war,"
1444,THE LORD GOD,"Coward, himself unseen. In pity, Lord, look down"
1445,THE LORD GOD,On the blank widowed plains which he hath made his own
1446,THE LORD GOD,"By right of solitude. Where, Lord God, are they now,"
1447,THE LORD GOD,"Thy glorious bison herds, Thy ariels white as snow,"
1448,THE LORD GOD,"Thy antelopes in troops, the zebras of Thy plain?"
1449,THE LORD GOD,Behold their whitened bones on the dull track of men.
1450,THE LORD GOD,"Thy elephants, Lord, where? For ages thou didst build"
1451,THE LORD GOD,"Their frames' capacity, the hide which was their shield"
1452,THE LORD GOD,"No thorn might pierce, no sting, no violent tooth assail,"
1453,THE LORD GOD,"The tusks which were their levers, the lithe trunk their flail."
1454,THE LORD GOD,Thou strengthenedst their deep brain. Thou madest them wise to know
1455,THE LORD GOD,"And wiser to ignore, advised, deliberate, slow,"
1456,THE LORD GOD,Conscious of power supreme in right. The manifest token
1457,THE LORD GOD,"Of Thy high will on earth, Thy natural peace unbroken,"
1458,THE LORD GOD,Unbreakable by fear. For ages did they move
1459,THE LORD GOD,"Thus, kings of Thy deep forest swayed by only love."
1460,THE LORD GOD,"Where are they now, Lord God? A fugitive spent few"
1461,THE LORD GOD,Used as Man's living targets by the ignoble crew
1462,THE LORD GOD,Who boast their coward skill to plant the balls that fly.
1463,THE LORD GOD,"Thy work of all time spoiled, their only use to die"
1464,THE LORD GOD,"That these sad clowns may laugh. Nay, Lord, we weep for _Thee_,"
1465,THE LORD GOD,And spend ourselves in tears for Thy marred majesty.
1466,THE LORD GOD,"Behold, Lord, what we bring--this last proof in our hands,"
1467,THE LORD GOD,"Their latest fiendliest spoil from Thy fair tropic lands,"
1468,THE LORD GOD,The birds of all the Earth unwinged to deck the heads
1469,THE LORD GOD,Of their unseemly women; plumage of such reds
1470,THE LORD GOD,"As not the sunset hath, such purples as no throne,"
1471,THE LORD GOD,"Not even in heaven, showeth,--hardly, Lord, Thine own;"
1472,THE LORD GOD,"Such azures as the sea's, such greens as are in Spring"
1473,THE LORD GOD,"The oak trees' tenderest buds of watched-for blossoming,"
1474,THE LORD GOD,Such opalescent pearls as only in Thy skies
1475,THE LORD GOD,The lunar bow revealeth to night's sleep-tired eyes.
1476,THE LORD GOD,"Behold them, Lord of Beauty, Lord of Reverence,"
1477,THE LORD GOD,"Lord of Compassion, Thou who meetest means to ends,"
1478,THE LORD GOD,"Nor madest Thy world fair for less than Thine own fame,"
1479,THE LORD GOD,"Behold Thy birds of joy lost, tortured, put to shame"
1480,THE LORD GOD,"For these vile strumpets' whim. Arise, or cease to be"
1481,THE LORD GOD,Judge of the quick and dead! These dead wings cry to Thee!

1513,THE LORD GOD,The wrong I did the Earth. Yet is Eternity
1514,THE LORD GOD,A long day for atonement. Thou thyself shalt be
1515,THE LORD GOD,My instrument here of wrath to purge this race of Man

1517,THE LORD GOD,"What, Angel, is thy counsel? Shall we unseal again"
1518,THE LORD GOD,"The fountains of the heavens, send our outpoured rain,"
1519,THE LORD GOD,And flood him with new waters? Shall it be by fire?
1520,THE LORD GOD,Shall we embraize the earth in one vast funeral pyre
1521,THE LORD GOD,By impact of a star? let loose a sulphurous wind?
1522,THE LORD GOD,Belch rocks from the Earth's bowels? Shall we strike Man blind

1524,THE LORD GOD,"The plains, that he fall palsied, grind him in the mills"
1525,THE LORD GOD,"Of a perpetual hail, importune him with snow,"
1526,THE LORD GOD,"Scourge him with noise unceasing, or the glutinous flow"
1527,THE LORD GOD,"Of a long pestilent stench? Speak, Satan, all thy thought,"

1539,SATAN,"For Thy worst lightning strokes, holding their principle"
1540,SATAN,Rock-firm in his own hand. All natural powers fulfil
1541,SATAN,His brain's omnipotence. He standeth at each point

1543,SATAN,Though Thou shouldst break the Earth in twain he should not bend.
1544,SATAN,"Thou needest a force to aid Thee, an ally, a friend,"
1545,SATAN,A principle of good which shall outwit his guile
1546,SATAN,"With true white guilelessness, his anger with a smile,"
1547,SATAN,"His force with utter weakness. Only thus, Lord God,"
1548,SATAN,"Shalt Thou regain Thy Earth, a purified abode,"

1566,SATAN,"Should be laid bare to shame, Time's fraud, Humanity."
1567,SATAN,"Choose Thee an Angel, Lord; it were enough. Thy Son"
1568,SATAN,Was a price all too great even had the world been won.
1569,SATAN,Nor can it be again. An Angel shall suffice
1570,SATAN,"For Thy new second sending, so Thou guide the choice"
1571,SATAN,To a more reasoned issue--so Thou leave Mankind
1572,SATAN,"Henceforth to his sole ways as at his outset, blind"
1573,SATAN,"To all but his own lusts, untutored by Thy grace."
1574,SATAN,"This is the road, Lord God. I bow before Thy face."

1584,THE LORD GOD,"Be thou absolved, good Angel, Ego absolvo te"
1585,THE LORD GOD,Ab omnibus peccatis. Once more be it thy right
1586,THE LORD GOD,"To stand before God's throne for ever in His sight,"
1587,THE LORD GOD,"And trusted more than these. Speak, Satan, what thou wilt,"
1588,THE LORD GOD,"All shall be granted thee, the glory with the guilt"
1589,THE LORD GOD,Of the Earth lost and won. Who is it thou wouldst send
1590,THE LORD GOD,Agent and messenger to work to this new end?
1591,THE LORD GOD,What Angel of them all? I pledge thee My full faith

1609,SATAN,"What should they do, Lord God, with a terrestrial birth,"
1610,SATAN,"With less than Thy long joys? Nay, rather choose Thee one"
1611,SATAN,"Already marred with grief with Time's disunion,"
1612,SATAN,"One all too sad for Heaven, to whom Eternity"
1613,SATAN,"Is as a charge o'erspent, who hath no fear to die,"
1614,SATAN,"But gladly would lie down and be for aye no more,"
1615,SATAN,"The flotsam of Time's waves upon Death's outer shore,"
1616,SATAN,"Forgotten and forgetting. Grant me, Lord God, this,"
1617,SATAN,"In penance for the past, Death's full forgetfulness."

1619,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
1620,THE LORD GOD,
1621,THE LORD GOD,And thou wouldst be incarnate?

1624,SATAN,
1625,SATAN,"As the least strong thing,"
1626,SATAN,"The frailest, the most fond, an insect on the wind,"
1627,SATAN,"Which shall prevail by love, by ignorance, by lack"
1628,SATAN,"Of all that Man most trusteth to secure his back,"
1629,SATAN,To arm his hand with might. What Thy Son dreamed of Man
1630,SATAN,"Will I work out anew as some poor cateran,"
1631,SATAN,"The weakest of the Earth, with only beauty's power"
1632,SATAN,"And Thy good grace to aid, the creature of an hour"
1633,SATAN,"Too fugitive for fight, too frail even far to fly,"
1634,SATAN,"And at the hour's end, Lord, to close my wings and die."
1635,SATAN,Such were the new redemption.

1637,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
1638,THE LORD GOD,
1639,THE LORD GOD,Thou good angel! Nay
1640,THE LORD GOD,The World were all unworthy such high price to pay.
1641,THE LORD GOD,I will not have thee die.

1645,SATAN,"'Tis not for the World's sake,"
1646,SATAN,"Lord God of Heaven and Earth, that I petition make,"
1647,SATAN,But for Thy justice foiled. It irketh me to know
1648,SATAN,"That I have tutored Man against Thee, to this woe,"
1649,SATAN,"And given him sure success. Yet is the World's self good,"
1650,SATAN,"And I would prove it Thee, lest Man's ingratitude"
1651,SATAN,"Should so affect all truth, all honour, all high faith,"
1652,SATAN,"That Thou Thyself, Lord God, shouldst fall a prey to death"
1653,SATAN,And leave him in dominion. What to me were Heaven
1654,SATAN,"With this thought unappeased--even thus absolved, forgiven,"
1655,SATAN,Yet by myself condemned?
1656,SATAN,
1657,THE LORD GOD,THE LORD GOD
1658,THE LORD GOD,
1659,THE LORD GOD,"Ah, Satan. Thy old pride"
1660,THE LORD GOD,Still lingereth in the clefts. Yet art thou not denied
1661,THE LORD GOD,"Since I have sworn thee faith. Go, thou good messenger"
1662,THE LORD GOD,And God's peace go with thee. Ho! ye without! Give ear.
1663,THE LORD GOD,"Bow down to the Lord Satan, Our anointed priest,"
1664,THE LORD GOD,The new incarnate Word.
