374,_HYMN TO PRIAPUS_,"I suppose, between now and then,"

2690,VI,touched that which was verily not me
2691,VI,verily it was not me.
2692,VI,Where I had been was a sudden blaze
2693,VI,a sudden flaring blaze!
2694,VI,"So I put my hand out further, a little further"

2696,VI,it verily was not I
2697,VI,it was the unknown.
2698,VI,
2699,VI,"Ha, I was a blaze leaping up!"
2700,VI,I was a tiger bursting into sunlight.
2701,VI,"I was greedy, I was mad for the unknown."
2702,VI,"I, new-risen, resurrected, starved from the tomb"
2703,VI,starved from a life of devouring always myself
2704,VI,"now here was I, new-awakened, with my hand"
2705,VI,stretching out
2706,VI,"and touching the unknown, the real unknown,"
2707,VI,the unknown unknown.
2708,VI,
2709,VI,"My God, but I can only say"

2711,VI,I am the first comer!

2714,VI,I am the first comer!
2715,VI,I am the discoverer!
2716,VI,I have found the other world!
2717,VI,
2718,VI,"The unknown, the unknown!"
2719,VI,I am thrown upon the shore.
2720,VI,I am covering myself with the sand.
2721,VI,I am filling my mouth with the earth.
2722,VI,I am burrowing my body into the soil.
2723,VI,"The unknown, the new world!"
2724,VI,
2725,VII,VII
2726,VII,
2727,VII,IT was the flank of my wife
2728,VII,"I touched with my hand, I clutched with my"
2729,VII,hand
2730,VII,"rising, new-awakened from the tomb!"
2731,VII,It was the flank of my wife
2732,VII,whom I married years ago
2733,VII,at whose side I have lain for over a thousand
2734,VII,nights
2735,VII,"and all that previous while, she was I, she"
2736,VII,was I;
2737,VII,"I touched her, it was I who touched and I who was"
2738,VII,touched.
2739,VII,
2740,VII,"Yet rising from the tomb, from the black oblivion"
2741,VII,"stretching out my hand, my hand flung like a"
2742,VII,"drowned man's hand on a rock,"
2743,VII,I touched her flank and knew I was carried by the
2744,VII,current in death
2745,VII,"over to the new world, and was climbing out on"
2746,VII,"the shore,"
2747,VII,"risen, not to the old world, the old, changeless I,"
2748,VII,"the old life,"
2749,VII,wakened not to the old knowledge
2750,VII,"but to a new earth, a new I, a new knowledge, a"
2751,VII,new world of time.
2752,VII,
2753,VII,"Ah no, I cannot tell you what it is, the new world"
2754,VII,"I cannot tell you the mad, astounded rapture of"
2755,VII,its discovery.
2756,VII,"I shall be mad with delight before I have done,"
2757,VII,and whosoever comes after will find me in the
2758,VII,new world
2759,VII,a madman in rapture.
2760,VII,
2761,VIII,VIII
2762,VIII,
2763,VIII,GREEN streams that flow from the innermost

2765,VIII,what are they?
2766,VIII,Green and illumined and travelling for ever
2767,VIII,dissolved with the mystery of the innermost heart
2768,VIII,of the continent
2769,VIII,"mystery beyond knowledge or endurance, so sump-"
2770,VIII,tuous
2771,VIII,out of the well-heads of the new world.--
2772,VIII,"The other, she too has strange green eyes!"
2773,VIII,White sands and fruits unknown and perfumes
2774,VIII,that never
2775,VIII,can blow across the dark seas to our usual
2776,VIII,world!
2777,VIII,And land that beats with a pulse!
2778,VIII,And valleys that draw close in love!
2779,VIII,And strange ways where I fall into oblivion of
2780,VIII,uttermost living!--
2781,VIII,Also she who is the other has strange-mounded
2782,VIII,"breasts and strange sheer slopes, and white"
2783,VIII,levels.
2784,VIII,
2785,VIII,Sightless and strong oblivion in utter life takes
2786,VIII,possession of me!
2787,VIII,"The unknown, strong current of life supreme"
2788,VIII,drowns me and sweeps me away and holds me
2789,VIII,down
2790,VIII,"to the sources of mystery, in the depths,"
2791,VIII,extinguishes there my risen resurrected life
2792,VIII,and kindles it further at the core of utter mystery.

2851,I,
2852,I,A WOMAN has given me strength and affluence.
2853,I,Admitted!
2854,I,
2855,I,"All the rocking wheat of Canada, ripening now,"
2856,I,has not so much of strength as the body of one
2857,I,woman
2858,I,"sweet in ear, nor so much to give"
2859,I,though it feed nations.
2860,I,
2861,I,Hunger is the very Satan.
2862,I,"The fear of hunger is Moloch, Belial, the horrible"
2863,I,God.
2864,I,It is a fearful thing to be dominated by the fear of
2865,I,hunger.
2866,I,
2867,I,"Not bread alone, not the belly nor the thirsty"
2868,I,throat.
2869,I,"I have never yet been smitten through the belly,"
2870,I,"with the lack of bread,"
2871,I,"no, nor even milk and honey."
2872,I,
2873,I,The fear of the want of these things seems to be
2874,I,quite left out of me.
2875,I,"For so much, I thank the good generations of man-"
2876,I,kind.
2877,I,
2878,II,II
2879,II,
2880,II,"AND the sweet, constant, balanced heat"
2881,II,"of the suave sensitive body, the hunger for this"
2882,II,has never seized me and terrified me.
2883,II,"Here again, man has been good in his legacy to us,"
2884,II,in these two primary instances.
2885,II,
2886,III,III
2887,III,
2888,III,"THEN the dumb, aching, bitter, helpless need,"
2889,III,"the pining to be initiated,"
2890,III,to have access to the knowledge that the great dead
2891,III,"have opened up for us, to know, to satisfy"
2892,III,the great and dominant hunger of the mind;
2893,III,"man's sweetest harvest of the centuries, sweet,"
2894,III,"printed books,"
2895,III,"bright, glancing, exquisite corn of many a stubborn"
2896,III,glebe in the upturned darkness;
2897,III,I thank mankind with passionate heart
2898,III,"that I just escaped the hunger for these,"
2899,III,"that they were given when I needed them,"
2900,III,because I am the son of man.
2901,III,
2902,III,"I have eaten, and drunk, and warmed and clothed"
2903,III,"my body,"
2904,III,"I have been taught the language of understanding,"
2905,III,I have chosen among the bright and marvellous
2906,III,"books,"
2907,III,"like any prince, such stores of the world's supply"
2908,III,"were open to me, in the wisdom and goodness of"
2909,III,man.
2910,III,"So far, so good."
2911,III,"Wise, good provision that makes the heart swell"
2912,III,with love!
2913,III,
2914,IV,IV
2915,IV,
2916,IV,BUT then came another hunger
2917,IV,"very deep, and ravening;"
2918,IV,the very body's body crying out
2919,IV,"with a hunger more frightening, more profound"
2920,IV,than stomach or throat or even the mind;
2921,IV,"redder than death, more clamorous."
2922,IV,
2923,IV,"The hunger for the woman. Alas,"
2924,IV,"it is so deep a Moloch, ruthless and strong,"
2925,IV,"'tis like the unutterable name of the dread Lord,"
2926,IV,not to be spoken aloud.
2927,IV,"Yet there it is, the hunger which comes upon us,"
2928,IV,"which we must learn to satisfy with pure, real"
2929,IV,satisfaction;
2930,IV,"or perish, there is no alternative."
2931,IV,
2932,IV,"I thought it was woman, indiscriminate woman,"
2933,IV,mere female adjunct of what I was.
2934,IV,"Ah, that was torment hard enough"
2935,IV,"and a thing to be afraid of,"
2936,IV,"a threatening, torturing, phallic Moloch."
2937,IV,
2938,IV,A woman fed that hunger in me at last.
2939,IV,"What many women cannot give, one woman can;"
2940,IV,so I have known it.
2941,IV,
2942,IV,She stood before me like riches that were mine.
2943,IV,"Even then, in the dark, I was tortured, ravening,"
2944,IV,"unfree,"
2945,IV,"Ashamed, and shameful, and vicious."
2946,IV,A man is so terrified of strong hunger;
2947,IV,and this terror is the root of all cruelty.
2948,IV,"She loved me, and stood before me, looking to me."
2949,IV,"How could I look, when I was mad? I looked"
2950,IV,"sideways, furtively,"
2951,IV,being mad with voracious desire.
2952,IV,
2953,V,V
2954,V,
2955,V,THIS comes right at last.
2956,V,"When a man is rich, he loses at last the hunger fear."
2957,V,I lost at last the fierceness that fears it will starve.
2958,V,I could put my face at last between her breasts
2959,V,and know that they were given for ever
2960,V,that I should never starve
2961,V,never perish;
2962,V,I had eaten of the bread that satisfies
2963,V,"and my body's body was appeased,"
2964,V,"there was peace and richness,"
2965,V,fulfilment.
2966,V,
2967,V,"Let them praise desire who will,"
2968,V,"but only fulfilment will do,"
2969,V,"real fulfilment, nothing short."
2970,V,It is our ratification
2971,V,"our heaven, as a matter of fact."
2972,V,"Immortality, the heaven, is only a projection of"
2973,V,"this strange but actual fulfilment,"
2974,V,here in the flesh.
2975,V,
2976,V,"So, another hunger was supplied,"
2977,V,"and for this I have to thank one woman,"
2978,V,"not mankind, for mankind would have prevented"
2979,V,me;
2980,V,"but one woman,"
2981,V,and these are my red-letter thanksgivings.
2982,V,
2983,VI,VI
2984,VI,
2985,VI,"To be, or not to be, is still the question."
2986,VI,This ache for being is the ultimate hunger.
2987,VI,"And for myself, I can say ""almost, almost, oh,"
2988,VI,"very nearly."""
2989,VI,Yet something remains.
2990,VI,Something shall not always remain.
2991,VI,For the main already is fulfilment.
2992,VI,
2993,VI,"What remains in me, is to be known even as I"
2994,VI,know.
2995,VI,"I know her now: or perhaps, I know my own"
2996,VI,limitation against her.
2997,VI,
2998,VI,"Plunging as I have done, over, over the brink"
2999,VI,"I have dropped at last headlong into nought,"
3000,VI,plunging upon sheer hard extinction;
3001,VI,"I have come, as it were, not to know,"
3002,VI,"died, as it were; ceased from knowing; surpassed"
3003,VI,myself.
3004,VI,"What can I say more, except that I know what it is"
3005,VI,to surpass myself?
3006,VI,
3007,VI,It is a kind of death which is not death.
3008,VI,It is going a little beyond the bounds.
3009,VI,"How can one speak, where there is a dumbness on"
3010,VI,one's mouth?
3011,VI,"I suppose, ultimately she is all beyond me,"
3012,VI,"she is all not-me, ultimately."
3013,VI,It is that that one comes to.
3014,VI,"A curious agony, and a relief, when I touch that"
3015,VI,"which is not me in any sense,"
3016,VI,it wounds me to death with my own not-being;
3017,VI,"definite, inviolable limitation,"
3018,VI,"and something beyond, quite beyond, if you"
3019,VI,understand what that means.
3020,VI,"It is the major part of being, this having surpassed"
3021,VI,"oneself,"
3022,VI,"this having touched the edge of the beyond, and"
3023,VI,"perished, yet not perished."
3024,VI,
3025,VII,VII
3026,VII,
3027,VII,"I WANT her though, to take the same from me."
3028,VII,"She touches me as if I were herself, her own."
3029,VII,"She has not realized yet, that fearful thing, that"
3030,VII,"I am the other,"
3031,VII,she thinks we are all of one piece.
3032,VII,It is painfully untrue.
3033,VII,
3034,VII,"I want her to touch me at last, ah, on the root and"
3035,VII,quick of my darkness
3036,VII,"and perish on me, as I have perished on her."
3037,VII,
3038,VII,"Then, we shall be two and distinct, we shall have"
3039,VII,each our separate being.
3040,VII,"And that will be pure existence, real liberty."
3041,VII,"Till then, we are confused, a mixture, unresolved,"
3042,VII,unextricated one from the other.
3043,VII,"It is in pure, unutterable resolvedness, distinction"
3044,VII,"of being, that one is free,"
3045,VII,"not in mixing, merging, not in similarity."
3046,VII,"When she has put her hand on my secret, darkest"
3047,VII,"sources, the darkest outgoings,"
3048,VII,"when it has struck home to her, like a death, ""this"
3049,VII,"is _him!_"""
3050,VII,"she has no part in it, no part whatever,"
3051,VII,"it is the terrible _other_,"
3052,VII,"when she knows the fearful _other flesh_, ah, dark-"
3053,VII,"ness unfathomable and fearful, contiguous and"
3054,VII,"concrete,"
3055,VII,"when she is slain against me, and lies in a heap"
3056,VII,"like one outside the house,"
3057,VII,when she passes away as I have passed away
3058,VII,"being pressed up against the _other_,"
3059,VII,"then I shall be glad, I shall not be confused with"
3060,VII,"her,"
3061,VII,"I shall be cleared, distinct, single as if burnished"
3062,VII,"in silver,"
3063,VII,"having no adherence, no adhesion anywhere,"
3064,VII,"one clear, burnished, isolated being, unique,"
3065,VII,"and she also, pure, isolated, complete,"
3066,VII,"two of us, unutterably distinguished, and in"
3067,VII,unutterable conjunction.
3068,VII,
3069,VII,"Then we shall be free, freer than angels, ah,"
3070,VII,perfect.
3071,VII,
3072,VIII,VIII
3073,VIII,
3074,VIII,"AFTER that, there will only remain that all men"
3075,VIII,"detach themselves and become unique,"
3076,VIII,"that we are all detached, moving in freedom more"
3077,VIII,"than the angels,"
3078,VIII,"conditioned only by our own pure single being,"
3079,VIII,having no laws but the laws of our own being.
3080,VIII,
3081,VIII,"Every human being will then be like a flower,"
3082,VIII,untrammelled.
3083,VIII,Every movement will be direct.
3084,VIII,"Only to be will be such delight, we cover our faces"
3085,VIII,when we think of it
3086,VIII,lest our faces betray us to some untimely fiend.
3087,VIII,
3088,VIII,"Every man himself, and therefore, a surpassing"
3089,VIII,singleness of mankind.
3090,VIII,"The blazing tiger will spring upon the deer, un-"
3091,VIII,"dimmed,"
3092,VIII,"the hen will nestle over her chickens,"
3093,VIII,"we shall love, we shall hate,"
3094,VIII,"but it will be like music, sheer utterance,"
3095,VIII,"issuing straight out of the unknown,"
3096,VIII,the lightning and the rainbow appearing in us
3097,VIII,"unbidden, unchecked,"
3098,VIII,like ambassadors.
3099,VIII,
3100,VIII,We shall not look before and after.
3101,VIII,"We shall _be_, _now_."
3102,VIII,We shall know in full.

3140,_AUTUMN RAIN_,manna invisible
3141,_AUTUMN RAIN_,
3142,_AUTUMN RAIN_,of all the pain
3143,_AUTUMN RAIN_,here to us given;
3144,_AUTUMN RAIN_,finely divisible
3145,_AUTUMN RAIN_,falling as rain.

3149,_FROST FLOWERS_,
3150,_FROST FLOWERS_,"IT is not long since, here among all these folk"
3151,_FROST FLOWERS_,"in London, I should have held myself"
3152,_FROST FLOWERS_,"of no account whatever,"
3153,_FROST FLOWERS_,but should have stood aside and made them way
3154,_FROST FLOWERS_,"thinking that they, perhaps,"
3155,_FROST FLOWERS_,had more right than I--for who was I?
3156,_FROST FLOWERS_,
3157,_FROST FLOWERS_,"Now I see them just the same, and watch them."
3158,_FROST FLOWERS_,But of what account do I hold them?
3159,_FROST FLOWERS_,
3160,_FROST FLOWERS_,Especially the young women. I look at them
3161,_FROST FLOWERS_,as they dart and flash
3162,_FROST FLOWERS_,"before the shops, like wagtails on the edge of a"
3163,_FROST FLOWERS_,pool.
3164,_FROST FLOWERS_,
3165,_FROST FLOWERS_,"If I pass them close, or any man,"
3166,_FROST FLOWERS_,"like sharp, slim wagtails they flash a little aside"
3167,_FROST FLOWERS_,pretending to avoid us; yet all the time
3168,_FROST FLOWERS_,calculating.
3169,_FROST FLOWERS_,
3170,_FROST FLOWERS_,"They think that we adore them--alas, would it"
3171,_FROST FLOWERS_,were true!
3172,_FROST FLOWERS_,
3173,_FROST FLOWERS_,"Probably they think all men adore them,"
3174,_FROST FLOWERS_,howsoever they pass by.
3175,_FROST FLOWERS_,
3176,_FROST FLOWERS_,"What is it, that, from their faces fresh as spring,"
3177,_FROST FLOWERS_,"such fair, fresh, alert, first-flower faces,"
3178,_FROST FLOWERS_,"like lavender crocuses, snowdrops, like Roman"
3179,_FROST FLOWERS_,"hyacinths,"
3180,_FROST FLOWERS_,"scyllas and yellow-haired hellebore, jonquils, dim"
3181,_FROST FLOWERS_,"anemones,"
3182,_FROST FLOWERS_,"even the sulphur auriculas,"
3183,_FROST FLOWERS_,"flowers that come first from the darkness, and feel"
3184,_FROST FLOWERS_,"cold to the touch,"
3185,_FROST FLOWERS_,"flowers scentless or pungent, ammoniacal almost;"
3186,_FROST FLOWERS_,"what is it, that, from the faces of the fair young"
3187,_FROST FLOWERS_,women
3188,_FROST FLOWERS_,"comes like a pungent scent, a vibration beneath"
3189,_FROST FLOWERS_,"that startles me, alarms me, stirs up a repulsion?"
3190,_FROST FLOWERS_,
3191,_FROST FLOWERS_,"They are the issue of acrid winter, these first-"
3192,_FROST FLOWERS_,flower young women;
3193,_FROST FLOWERS_,"their scent is lacerating and repellant,"
3194,_FROST FLOWERS_,"it smells of burning snow, of hot-ache,"
3195,_FROST FLOWERS_,"of earth, winter-pressed, strangled in corruption;"
3196,_FROST FLOWERS_,"it is the scent of the fiery-cold dregs of corruption,"
3197,_FROST FLOWERS_,"when destruction soaks through the mortified,"
3198,_FROST FLOWERS_,"decomposing earth,"
3199,_FROST FLOWERS_,and the last fires of dissolution burn in the bosom
3200,_FROST FLOWERS_,of the ground.
3201,_FROST FLOWERS_,
3202,_FROST FLOWERS_,"They are the flowers of ice-vivid mortification,"
3203,_FROST FLOWERS_,"thaw-cold, ice-corrupt blossoms,"
3204,_FROST FLOWERS_,with a loveliness I loathe;
3205,_FROST FLOWERS_,"for what kind of ice-rotten, hot-aching heart"
3206,_FROST FLOWERS_,must they need to root in!

3213,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,Let it be spring!
3214,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Come, bubbling, surging tide of sap!"
3215,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Come, rush of creation!"

3218,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Come, sweep away these exquisite, ghastly first-"
3219,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"flowers,"
3220,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,which are rather last-flowers!
3221,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Come, thaw down their cool portentousness,"
3222,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,dissolve them:
3223,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"snowdrops, straight, death-veined exhalations of"
3224,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"white and purple crocuses,"
3225,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"flowers of the penumbra, issue of corruption,"
3226,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"nourished in mortification,"
3227,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,jets of exquisite finality;
3228,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Come, spring, make havoc of them!"
3229,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,
3230,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"I trample on the snowdrops, it gives me pleasure"
3231,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"to tread down the jonquils,"
3232,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,to destroy the chill Lent lilies;
3233,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"for I am sick of them, their faint-bloodedness,"
3234,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"slow-blooded, icy-fleshed, portentous."
3235,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,
3236,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"I want the fine, kindling wine-sap of spring,"
3237,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"gold, and of inconceivably fine, quintessential"
3238,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"brightness,"
3239,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"rare almost as beams, yet overwhelmingly potent,"
3240,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,strong like the greatest force of world-balancing.
3241,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,
3242,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,This is the same that picks up the harvest of wheat
3243,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"and rocks it, tons of grain, on the ripening wind;"
3244,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,the same that dangles the globe-shaped pleiads of
3245,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,fruit
3246,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"temptingly in mid-air, between a playful thumb and"
3247,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,finger;
3248,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"oh, and suddenly, from out of nowhere, whirls"
3249,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"the pear-bloom,"
3250,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"upon us, and apple- and almond- and apricot-"
3251,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"and quince-blossom,"
3252,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,storms and cumulus clouds of all imaginable
3253,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,blossom
3254,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"about our bewildered faces,"
3255,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,though we do not worship.
3256,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,
3257,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,I wish it were spring
3258,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"cunningly blowing on the fallen sparks, odds and"
3259,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"ends of the old, scattered fire,"
3260,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,and kindling shapely little conflagrations
3261,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"curious long-legged foals, and wide-eared calves,"
3262,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,and naked sparrow-bubs.
3263,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,
3264,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,I wish that spring
3265,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,would start the thundering traffic of feet
3266,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"new feet on the earth, beating with impatience."
3267,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,
3268,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"I wish it were spring, thundering"

3270,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"I wish these brittle, frost-lovely flowers of pas-"
3271,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"sionate, mysterious corruption"
3272,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,were not yet to come still more from the still-
3273,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,flickering discontent.
3274,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,
3275,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Oh, in the spring, the bluebell bows him down for"
3276,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"very exuberance,"

3278,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,bowed down with his inner magnificence!
3279,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,
3280,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Oh, yes, the gush of spring is strong enough"
3281,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,to toss the globe of earth like a ball on a water-jet
3282,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,dancing sportfully;
3283,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,as you see a tiny celluloid ball tossing on a squint
3284,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,of water
3285,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"for men to shoot at, penny-a-time, in a booth at a"
3286,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,fair.
3287,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,
3288,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,The gush of spring is strong enough
3289,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,to play with the globe of earth like a ball on a
3290,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,fountain;
3291,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,At the same time it opens the tiny hands of the
3292,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,hazel
3293,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,with such infinite patience.
3294,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,
3295,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"The power of the rising, golden, all-creative sap"
3296,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,could take the earth
3297,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"and heave it off among the stars, into the in-"
3298,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,visible;
3299,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,the same sets the throstle at sunset on a bough
3300,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,singing against the blackbird;
3301,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"comes out in the hesitating tremor of the primrose,"
3302,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,and betrays its candour in the round white straw-
3303,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"berry flower,"
3304,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"is dignified in the foxglove, like a Red-Indian"
3305,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,brave.
3306,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,
3307,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Ah come, come quickly, spring!"
3308,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Come and lift us towards our culmination, we"
3309,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,myriads;
3310,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"we who have never flowered, like patient cactuses."
3311,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Come and lift us to our end, to blossom, bring us"
3312,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,to our summer
3313,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,we who are winter-weary in the winter of the world.
3314,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Come making the chaffinch nests hollow and cosy,"
3315,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,come and soften the willow buds till they are
3316,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"puffed and furred,"
3317,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,then blow them over with gold.
3318,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,Come and cajole the gawky colt's-foot flowers.
3319,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,
3320,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Come quickly, and vindicate us"
3321,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,against too much death.
3322,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Come quickly, and stir the rotten globe of the"
3323,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"world from within,"
3324,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"burst it with germination, with world anew."
3325,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Come now, to us, your adherents, who cannot"
3326,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,flower from the ice.
3327,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,All the world gleams with the lilies of Death the
3328,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Unconquerable,"
3329,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"but come, give us our turn."
3330,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Enough of the virgins and lilies, of passionate,"
3331,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"suffocating perfume of corruption,"
3332,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"no more narcissus perfume, lily harlots, the blades"
3333,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,of sensation
3334,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,piercing the flesh to blossom of death.
3335,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Have done, have done with this shuddering,"
3336,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,delicious business
3337,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"of thrilling ruin in the flesh, of pungent passion,"
3338,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"of rare, death-edged ecstasy."
3339,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Give us our turn, give us a chance, let our hour"

3341,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"O soon, soon!"
3342,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,
3343,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,Let the darkness turn violet with rich dawn.

3346,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,incipient purpling towards summer in the world

3348,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,
3349,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,Are the violets already here!
3350,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Show me! I tremble so much to hear it, that even"

3352,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"on the threshold of spring, I fear I shall die."
3353,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,Show me the violets that are out.
3354,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,
3355,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"Oh, if it be true, and the living darkness of the"

3357,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,if the violets are coming out from under the rack
3358,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,"of men, winter-rotten and fallen"
3359,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,we shall have spring.
3360,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,Pray not to die on this Pisgah blossoming with
3361,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,violets.
3362,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,Pray to live through.
3363,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,
3364,_CRAVING FOR SPRING_,If you catch a whiff of violets from the darkness of
