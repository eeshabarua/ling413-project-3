142,PREFACE,
143,PREFACE,"_""Of making many books there is no end.""--Eccles. 12:12._"
144,PREFACE,
145,PREFACE,
146,PREFACE,"When the above words were written by Solomon, King of Israel, about"
147,PREFACE,"three thousand years ago, they were possibly inspired by the existence"
148,PREFACE,even at that early period of an extensive and probably overweighted
149,PREFACE,literature.
150,PREFACE,
151,PREFACE,The same literary conditions are as true to-day as when the above truism
152,PREFACE,emanated from that most wonderful of all human intellects. Every age and
153,PREFACE,"generation, as well as every changing religious or political condition,"
154,PREFACE,has brought with it its own peculiar and essentially differing current
155,PREFACE,"literature, which, as a rule, continued a brief season, and then"
156,PREFACE,"vanished, perishing with the age and conditions which called it into"
157,PREFACE,"being; leaving, however, an occasional volume, masterpiece, or even"
158,PREFACE,"quotation, to become classic, and in the form of standard literature"
159,PREFACE,"survive for generations, and in many instances for ages."
160,PREFACE,
161,PREFACE,Poetry has always occupied a unique position in literature; and though
162,PREFACE,"from a pecuniary stand-point usually unprofitable, it enjoys the decided"
163,PREFACE,advantage of longevity.
164,PREFACE,
165,PREFACE,The mysterious ages of antiquity have bequeathed to all succeeding time
166,PREFACE,"several of earth's noblest epics, while the contemporaneous prose, if"
167,PREFACE,"any existed, has long lain buried in the inscrutable archives of the"
168,PREFACE,remote past.
169,PREFACE,
170,PREFACE,"The two most notable of these, the Iliad and the Odyssey, are believed"
171,PREFACE,"to have been transmitted from generation to generation, orally, by the"
172,PREFACE,"minstrels and minnisingers, until the introduction or inception of the"
173,PREFACE,"Greek alphabet, when they were reduced to parchment, and, surviving all"
174,PREFACE,"the vicissitudes of time and sequent political and religious change,"
175,PREFACE,still occupy a prominent place in literature.
176,PREFACE,
177,PREFACE,"The Book of Job, generally accepted as the most ancient of writings, now"
178,PREFACE,"extant, whether sacred or secular, was doubtless originally a primitive"
179,PREFACE,though sublime poetical effusion.
180,PREFACE,
181,PREFACE,"The prose works contemporaneous with Chaucer, Spencer, and even with"
182,PREFACE,"that most wonderful of literary epochs, the Elizabethan age, are now"
183,PREFACE,"practically obsolete, while the poetical efforts remain in some"
184,PREFACE,instances with increased prominence.
185,PREFACE,
186,PREFACE,"Someone, (although just who is difficult to determine,--though it savors"
187,PREFACE,"of the Greek School of Philosophy,--)has delivered the following"
188,PREFACE,"injunction: ""Do right because it is right, not from fear of punishment"
189,PREFACE,"or hope of reward."" Waiving the question as to whether it is right or"
190,PREFACE,"not to compose poetry, he who aspires in that direction can reasonably"
191,PREFACE,"expect no material recompense, though the experience of Dante,"
192,PREFACE,"Cervantes, Leigh Hunt, and others, proves conclusively that poets do not"
193,PREFACE,"always escape punishment. In fact, about the only emolument to be"
194,PREFACE,"expected is the gratification of an inherent and indefinable impulse,"
195,PREFACE,"which impels one to the task with equal force, whether the ultimate"
196,PREFACE,result be affluence or a dungeon.
197,PREFACE,
198,PREFACE,The author of this unpretentious volume has long questioned the
199,PREFACE,advisability of adding a book to our already inflated and overloaded
200,PREFACE,"literature, unless it should contain something in the nature of a"
201,PREFACE,deviation from beaten literary paths.
202,PREFACE,
203,PREFACE,Whether the reading public will regard this as such or not is a question
204,PREFACE,"for the future to determine, as every book is a creature of"
205,PREFACE,"circumstance, and at the date of its publication an algebraic unknown"
206,PREFACE,quantity.
207,PREFACE,
208,PREFACE,It was not the original intention of the author to publish any of his
209,PREFACE,effusions in collective form until more mature years and riper judgment
210,PREFACE,"should better qualify him for the task of composition, and should enable"
211,PREFACE,"him to still further pursue the important studies of etymology,"
212,PREFACE,"rhetoric, Latin and Greek, and complete the education which youthful"
213,PREFACE,environment denied.
214,PREFACE,
215,PREFACE,"On the 17th of March, A.D. 1900, occurred an accident in the form of a"
216,PREFACE,premature mining explosion which banished the light of the Colorado sun
217,PREFACE,"from his eyes forever, adding the almost insurmountable barrier of"
218,PREFACE,total and hopeless blindness to those of limited means and insufficient
219,PREFACE,"education. At first further effort seemed useless, but as time"
220,PREFACE,meliorates in some degree even the most deplorable and distressing
221,PREFACE,"physical conditions, ambition slowly rallied, and while lying for"
222,PREFACE,several months a patient in various hospitals in an ineffectual attempt
223,PREFACE,"to regain even partial sight, the following ideas and efforts of past"
224,PREFACE,"years were gradually recalled from the recesses of memory, and reduced"
225,PREFACE,"to their present form, in which, with no small hesitation and misgiving,"
226,PREFACE,"they are presented to the consideration of the reading public, which in"
227,PREFACE,the humble opinion of the author has frequently failed to receive and
228,PREFACE,appreciate productions of vastly superior merit.

2091,DYING THOUGHTS.,
2092,DYING THOUGHTS.,As Life's receding sunset fades
2093,DYING THOUGHTS.,"And night descends,"
2094,DYING THOUGHTS.,"I calmly watch the gathering shades,"
2095,DYING THOUGHTS.,As darkness stealthily invades
2096,DYING THOUGHTS.,And daylight ends.
2097,DYING THOUGHTS.,
2098,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Earth's span is drawing to its close,"
2099,DYING THOUGHTS.,With every breath;
2100,DYING THOUGHTS.,"My pain-racked brain no respite knows,"

2103,DYING THOUGHTS.,
2104,DYING THOUGHTS.,"The curtain falls on Life's last scene,"
2105,DYING THOUGHTS.,The end is neared;
2106,DYING THOUGHTS.,"At last I face death's somber screen,"

2108,DYING THOUGHTS.,Have disappeared.
2109,DYING THOUGHTS.,

2213,DYING THOUGHTS.,
2214,DYING THOUGHTS.,"St. Regimund, e'er he became a saint,"
2215,DYING THOUGHTS.,Was much imbued with vulgar earthly taint;
2216,DYING THOUGHTS.,E'er he renounced the honors of a Knight
2217,DYING THOUGHTS.,"And doffed his coat of mail and helmet bright,"
2218,DYING THOUGHTS.,"For sober cassock and monastic hood,"
2219,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Leaving the castle for the cloister rude,"
2220,DYING THOUGHTS.,And changed the banquet's sumptuous repast
2221,DYING THOUGHTS.,For frugal crusts and the ascetic fast;
2222,DYING THOUGHTS.,Forsook his charger and equipments for
2223,DYING THOUGHTS.,The crucifix and sacerdotal war;
2224,DYING THOUGHTS.,While yet with valiant sword and blazoned shield
2225,DYING THOUGHTS.,"He braved the dangers of the martial field,"
2226,DYING THOUGHTS.,Or sought the antlered trophies of the chase
2227,DYING THOUGHTS.,In forest and sequestered hunting place;
2228,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Or, tiring of the hunt's exciting sport,"
2229,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Enjoyed the idle pleasures of the court,"
2230,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Whiling away the time with games of chance,"
2231,DYING THOUGHTS.,"With music and the more voluptuous dance,"
2232,DYING THOUGHTS.,"The hollow paths of vanity pursued,"
2233,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Laughed, jested, swore, drank, danced, and even wooed;"
2234,DYING THOUGHTS.,"No tongue more prone to questionable wit,"
2235,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Nor chaste, when time and place demanded it;"
2236,DYING THOUGHTS.,"His basso voice, both voluble and strong,"
2237,DYING THOUGHTS.,Excelled in wassail mirth and ribald song;
2238,DYING THOUGHTS.,He swore with oaths most impious and unblest;
2239,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Ate much, drank more, on these lines did his best;"
2240,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Caroused by day, caroused by candle light,"
2241,DYING THOUGHTS.,In fact behaved like any other knight.
2242,DYING THOUGHTS.,
2243,DYING THOUGHTS.,This medieval knight (the legend saith)
2244,DYING THOUGHTS.,For months would scarcely draw a sober breath;
2245,DYING THOUGHTS.,But as his appetite grew more and more
2246,DYING THOUGHTS.,Drank each day worse than on the day before;
2247,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Was drunk all night, all day continued so,"
2248,DYING THOUGHTS.,Indulged in every vice he chanced to know.
2249,DYING THOUGHTS.,But long debauch and riotous excess
2250,DYING THOUGHTS.,Reduce their strongest votaries to distress;
2251,DYING THOUGHTS.,When nature can the strain no longer stand
2252,DYING THOUGHTS.,"She chastens with a sure and irate hand,"
2253,DYING THOUGHTS.,"So when the day of reckoning had come,"
2254,DYING THOUGHTS.,She smote with fever and delirium
2255,DYING THOUGHTS.,This valiant knight whom we have tried to paint;
2256,DYING THOUGHTS.,A very slim foundation for a saint!
2257,DYING THOUGHTS.,
2258,DYING THOUGHTS.,"The crisis reached, his fever stricken brain"
2259,DYING THOUGHTS.,Surrendered reason to excessive pain;
2260,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Nor moment's respite, comatose and kind,"
2261,DYING THOUGHTS.,Relieved the raging furnace of his mind;
2262,DYING THOUGHTS.,"And gruesome spectres, awful and unreal,"
2263,DYING THOUGHTS.,Through his disordered vagaries would steal;
2264,DYING THOUGHTS.,When last his scorching temples sought repose
2265,DYING THOUGHTS.,"In hasty nap or intermittent doze,"
2266,DYING THOUGHTS.,"His eyes beheld, though starting from his head,"
2267,DYING THOUGHTS.,"A grizzly figure leaning o'er his bed,"
2268,DYING THOUGHTS.,"With aspect foul beyond descriptive word,"
2269,DYING THOUGHTS.,"As one for months in sepulchre interred,"
2270,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Restored again to animated breath,"
2271,DYING THOUGHTS.,A weird composite type of life and death;
2272,DYING THOUGHTS.,"With countenance most hideous and vile,"
2273,DYING THOUGHTS.,Leering with ghastly and unearthly smile;
2274,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Pointing its shriveled finger, as in scorn,"
2275,DYING THOUGHTS.,Of mockery and accusation born.
2276,DYING THOUGHTS.,
2277,DYING THOUGHTS.,As he beheld in terror and surprise
2278,DYING THOUGHTS.,This gruesome shape which mocked before his eyes
2279,DYING THOUGHTS.,He could distinguish in its haughty mien
2280,DYING THOUGHTS.,"A bearing, something as his own had been;"
2281,DYING THOUGHTS.,Nor had its withered visage quite the look
2282,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Of vampire, ghoul or evanescent spook;"
2283,DYING THOUGHTS.,"And as the apparition o'er him bent,"
2284,DYING THOUGHTS.,"He saw that every seam or lineament,"
2285,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Contour of feature, prominence of bone,"
2286,DYING THOUGHTS.,Bore all a striking semblance to his own.
2287,DYING THOUGHTS.,
2288,DYING THOUGHTS.,"The horror stricken knight essayed to speak,"
2289,DYING THOUGHTS.,"But words responded tremulous and weak,"
2290,DYING THOUGHTS.,"And mustering his dissipated strength,"
2291,DYING THOUGHTS.,"A sitting posture he assumed at length,--"
2292,DYING THOUGHTS.,"""Whate'er thou art, thou harbinger of gloom,"
2293,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Thou fiend or ghoul, fresh from the new made tomb,"
2294,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Thou vampire, diabolical and fell,"
2295,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Thou stygian shade or denizen of hell,"
2296,DYING THOUGHTS.,"I charge thee, thing of evil, to confess"
2297,DYING THOUGHTS.,Why thou hast thus disturbed my sore distress.
2298,DYING THOUGHTS.,Why hast thou burst my chamber's bolted door
2299,DYING THOUGHTS.,Where guest unbidden never trod before?
2300,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Break this suspense, so horrible and still!"
2301,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Declare thy tidings, be they good or ill,"
2302,DYING THOUGHTS.,Be thou from Heaven or from the realms below.
2303,DYING THOUGHTS.,"I charge thee speak, be thou a friend or foe;"
2304,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Break thou thy silence, ominous and deep,"
2305,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Or hence! Pursue thy way and let me sleep!"""
2306,DYING THOUGHTS.,
2307,DYING THOUGHTS.,"The grizzly spectre, still more ghastly grown,"
2308,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Surveyed with visage obdurate as stone,"
2309,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Then smiled with grimace of derisive craft,"
2310,DYING THOUGHTS.,"And in a most repugnant manner, laughed,"
2311,DYING THOUGHTS.,"But all the knight discerned with eye and ear,"
2312,DYING THOUGHTS.,Was his own maudlin laugh and drunken leer.
2313,DYING THOUGHTS.,"""Breathe thou thy message,"" shrieked the frantic knight"
2314,DYING THOUGHTS.,"""Discharge thy purpose, though it blast and blight,"
2315,DYING THOUGHTS.,"I charge thee, speak, by all that is most fair."
2316,DYING THOUGHTS.,"By all most foul, I charge thee to declare;"
2317,DYING THOUGHTS.,By my bright armor and my trusty sword;
2318,DYING THOUGHTS.,"I charge thee, speak, by Holy Rood and Word!"""
2319,DYING THOUGHTS.,"He sank exhausted, in such pallid fright"
2320,DYING THOUGHTS.,The snowy sheets looked dark beside such white.
2321,DYING THOUGHTS.,"The spectre paused in silence for awhile,"
2322,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Then broke into a most repulsive smile,"
2323,DYING THOUGHTS.,"And answered in a weird and hollow tone,"
2324,DYING THOUGHTS.,Enough to freeze the marrow in the bone:
2325,DYING THOUGHTS.,"""I am thy blasted spirit's counterpart,"
2326,DYING THOUGHTS.,"A body fit for thy most evil heart,"
2327,DYING THOUGHTS.,"I am thy life, its psychic image sent"
2328,DYING THOUGHTS.,"To bear thee company, till thou repent."""
2329,DYING THOUGHTS.,
2330,DYING THOUGHTS.,"'Tis said, for forty days the spectre stayed."
2331,DYING THOUGHTS.,For forty days the knight incessant prayed;
2332,DYING THOUGHTS.,"With scourge, with vigil and ascetic rite,"
2333,DYING THOUGHTS.,"With fast, with groan remorseful and contrite,"
2334,DYING THOUGHTS.,"He cleansed his blackened spirit by degrees,"
2335,DYING THOUGHTS.,And purified it from its vanities;
2336,DYING THOUGHTS.,"And as he prayed, the spectre's gruesome scowl"
2337,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Grew day by day less hideous and foul,"
2338,DYING THOUGHTS.,"As he waxed holy, it became more bright;"
2339,DYING THOUGHTS.,"And after forty days, arrayed in white"
2340,DYING THOUGHTS.,"It spread its spotless arms, devoid of taint"
2341,DYING THOUGHTS.,Above this erstwhile knight and henceforth saint
2342,DYING THOUGHTS.,"In benediction, as he knelt in prayer,--"
2343,DYING THOUGHTS.,Then vanished instantly to empty air.
2344,DYING THOUGHTS.,
2345,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Such is the tale, embellished by the Muse,"
2346,DYING THOUGHTS.,"'Tis true or false, believe it as you choose;"
2347,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Some folks accept the story out and out,"
2348,DYING THOUGHTS.,While some prefer to entertain a doubt.
2349,DYING THOUGHTS.,"But if it be fictitious and unreal,"
2350,DYING THOUGHTS.,"'Tis not subscribed and sworn, and bears no seal;"
2351,DYING THOUGHTS.,"It points a moral, as the legend old,"
2352,DYING THOUGHTS.,"If it conveys it, 'twas not vainly told,"
2353,DYING THOUGHTS.,For should I such an apparition see--
2354,DYING THOUGHTS.,I think t'would almost make a monk of me.

2394,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Ascending on the wings of air,"
2395,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Though it should reach no listening ear,"
2396,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Of Deity inclined to hear,"
2397,DYING THOUGHTS.,"Still soothes the anguish of the mind,"
