34,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
35,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"It is too true, after all, that the lives of poets are not, in general,"
36,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"very interesting. Could we, indeed, trace the private workings of their"
37,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"souls, and read the pages of their mental and moral development, no"
38,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"biographies could be richer in instruction, and even entertainment, than"
39,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,those of our greater bards. The inner life of every true poet must be
40,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"poetical. But in proportion to the romance of their souls' story, is"
41,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"often the commonplace of their outward career. There have been poets,"
42,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"however, whose lives are quite as readable and as instructive as their"
43,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"poetry, and have even shed a reflex and powerful interest on their"
44,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"writings. The interest of such lives has, in general, proceeded either"
45,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"from the extraordinary misfortunes of the bard, or from his extremely"
46,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"bad morals, or from his strange personal idiosyncrasy, or from his being"
47,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,involved in the political or religious conflicts of his age. The life of
48,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Milton, for instance, is rendered intensely interesting from his"
49,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,connexion with the public affairs of his critical and solemn era. The
50,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"life of Johnson is made readable from his peculiar conformation of body,"
51,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"his bear-like manners, his oddities, and his early struggles. You devour"
52,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the life of Gifford, not because he was a poet, but because he was a"
53,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"shoemaker; and that of Byron, more on account of his vices, his peerage,"
54,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and his domestic unhappiness, than for the sake of his poetry. And in"
55,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Waller, too, you feel some supplemental interest, because he united what"
56,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,are usually thought the incompatible characters of a poet and a
57,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"political plotter, and very nearly reached the altitudes of the gallows"
58,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,as well as those of Parnassus.
59,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
60,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"March 1605 was the date, and Coleshill, in Hertfordshire, the place, of"
61,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,the birth of our poet. He was of an ancient and honourable family
62,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"originally from Kent, some members of which were distinguished for their"
63,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"wealth and others for the valour with which, at Agincourt and elsewhere,"
64,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"they fought the battles of their country. Robert Waller, the poet's"
65,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"father, inherited from Edmund, _his_ father, the lands of Beaconsfield,"
66,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"in Bucks, and other territory in Hertfordshire. These had been in 1548-9"
67,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"left by Francis Waller, in default of issue by his own wife, to his"
68,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"brothers Thomas and Edmund, but Thomas dying, Edmund inherited the"
69,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"whole. Robert, on receiving his estates, quitted the profession of the"
70,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"law, to which he had attached himself, and spent the rest of his life"
71,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"chiefly at Beaconsfield, employed in the manly business and healthy"
72,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"amusements of a country gentleman. He died in August 1616, and left a"
73,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"widow and a son--the son, Edmund, being eleven years of age. It was at"
74,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Beaconsfield. We need hardly remind our readers, that a far greater"
75,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Edmund--Edmund Burke--spent many of his days. It was there that he
76,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"composed his latest and noblest works, the ""Reflections on the French"
77,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Revolution,"" and the ""Letters on a Regicide Peace;"" and there he"
78,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"surrendered to the Creator one of the subtlest, strongest, brightest,"
79,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and best of human souls. Shortly after Burke's death, the house of"
80,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Beaconsfield was burnt down, and no trace of it is now, we believe,"
81,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,extant.
82,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
83,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Mrs. Waller's brother, William, was the father of John Hampden. His"
84,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"wife, Elizabeth Cromwell, the aunt of the great Oliver, was, however,"
85,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and continued to the end, a violent Royalist; and Cromwell, although he"
86,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"treated both her and her son with kindness, and on the terms of their"
87,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"relationship, was so provoked at hearing that she carried on a secret"
88,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"correspondence with the Stewart party, that he confined her under a very"
89,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"strict watch in the house of her daughter, Mrs. Price, whose husband was"
90,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,on the side of the Parliament. It is exceedingly probable that from the
91,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""mother's milk"" of early prejudice was derived that spirit of"
92,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,partisanship which distinguished alike the writings and the life of the
93,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"poet. It is possible, too, that contact with men so far above moral"
94,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"heroism and rugged mental force as Cromwell and Hampden, instead of"
95,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"exciting emulation, led to envy, and that his divergence from their"
96,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,political path sprung more from personal feeling than from principle.
97,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
98,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"He was educated, first, at the grammar school of Market, Wickham; then"
99,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"at Eton; and, in fine, at King's College, Cambridge. Accounts vary as to"
100,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"his proficiency--one Bigge, who had been his school-fellow at Wickham,"
101,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,told Aubrey that he never expected Waller to have become such an eminent
102,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"poet, and that he used to write his exercises for him. Others, on the"
103,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"contrary, have alleged that it was the fame of his scholarship which led"
104,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"to his election for Agmondesham, a borough in Bucks, when he was only"
105,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"sixteen years of age. This story, so far as his premature learning goes,"
106,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"seems rather apocryphal; but certain it is, that when scarcely eighteen,"
107,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,he had become M.P. for the above-mentioned borough. The parliament in
108,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"which he found himself, was one of those subservient and cringing"
109,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,assemblies which James I. was wont to summon to sit till they had voted
110,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the supplies, and then contemptuously to dismiss. It met in November"
111,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"1621, and after passing a resolution in support of their privileges,"
112,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"which James tore out of the Journals with his own hand, and granting the"
113,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"usual supplies, was dissolved on the 6th of January 1622. Waller was"
114,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"probably as silent and servile as any of his neighbours. He began,"
115,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"however, to feel his way as a courtier, and overheard some curious and"
116,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"not very canonical talk of James with his lords and bishops, the record"
117,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"of which reminds you of some of the richer scenes of the ""Fortunes of"
118,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Nigel."" The next parliament was not called till 1624, when Waller was"
119,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"not elected. The electors of Agmondesham, who had, meantime, obtained"
120,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"fuller privileges, chose two matured members to represent them, and the"
121,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,precocious boy lost his seat.
122,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
123,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Waller's ""political and poetical life began nearly together."" It was in"
124,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,his eighteenth year that he wrote his first poetical piece--that on the
125,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,escape of Prince Charles from a tempest on his return from Spain. It is
126,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,a tissue of smooth and musical mediocrity. It shews a kind of stunted
127,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,prematurity. The perfection which is attained by a single effort is
128,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"generally a poor and tame one. This poem of Waller's, like several of"
129,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"his others, has all that merit which arises from the absence of fault,"
130,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,and all that fault which arises from the absence of merit--of high
131,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"poetic merit, we mean, for in music it is equal to any of his poems."
132,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Much has been said about the model which he followed in his
133,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"versification, the majority of critics tracing in it an imitation of"
134,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Fairfax's Tasso. The fact seems to be that Waller, with a good ear, had"
135,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"a very limited theory of verse. He worshipped smoothness, and sought it"
136,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,at every hazard. He preferred the Jacob of a soft flowing commonplace to
137,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the rough hairy Esau of a strong originality, cumbered with its own"
138,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"weight and richness. We think that this excessive love of the soft, and"
139,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"horror at the rude, materially weakened his genius. The true theory of"
140,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"versification lies in variety, and in accommodation to the necessities"
141,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and fluctuations of the thought. The ""Paradise Lost,"" written in"
142,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Waller's rhyme, would have been as ridiculous as Waller's love to"
143,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Saccharissa expressed in Milton's blank verse. The school before Waller
144,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"were too rugged, but surely there is a medium between the roughness of"
145,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Donne, and the honied monotony of the author of the ""Summer Islands."""
146,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"The practice of running the lines into one another, severely condemned"
147,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"by Johnson, and systematically shunned by Waller, has often been"
148,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,practised with success by poets far greater than either--such as Shelley
149,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and Coleridge. It is remarkable that Dryden, while he praised, did not"
150,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"copy our poet's manner, but gave himself freer scope. Pope, on the other"
151,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"hand, pushed his love of uniform tinkle and unmitigated softness to"
152,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"excess, and transferred this kind of luscious verse from small poems,"
153,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"where it is often a merit, to large ones, where it is a mistake. In his"
154,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""Iliad,"" for instance, the fierce ire of Achilles, the dignified"
155,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"resentment of Agamemnon, the dull courage of Ajax, the chivalrous"
156,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"sentiment of Hector, the glowing energy of Diomede, the veteran wisdom"
157,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"of Nestor, the grief of Andromache, the love of Helen, the jealousy of"
158,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Juno, and the godlike majesty of Jupiter, are all expressed in the same"
159,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"sweet and monotonous melody--a verse called ""heroic,"" by courtesy, or on"
160,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the principle of contradiction, like _lucus a non lucendo_. In Waller,"
161,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"however, his poems being all, without exception, rather short, you never"
162,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,think of quarrelling with his uniformity of manner; and rise from his
163,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"lines as from a liberal feast of hot-house grapes, thankful, but feeling"
164,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,that a _few more_ would have turned satisfaction into nausea. Yet you
165,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"feel, too, that perhaps his selection of small themes, and the"
166,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"consequent curbing of his powers, have sprung from his fastidiousness in"
167,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the matter of versification. The sermons, the satires, the speeches, the"
168,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"odes, and the didactic poems of the fastidious are generally _short_,"
169,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and do not, therefore, fully mirror the amplitude, or express the energy"
170,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"of their genius. To his poem on the escape of Prince Charles, succeeded"
171,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"that on the Prince, and two or three others of a similar kind; all"
172,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"finding their inspiration, not as yet in that love of others which"
173,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"animated his amatory effusions, but in that love to himself and his own"
174,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"interest which marks the incipient courtier, who is beginning, in"
175,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Shakspeare's thought, to hang his knee upon ""hinges,"" that it may bend"
176,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,more readily to power. Yet his case shews that there is a certain
177,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,incompatibility between the profession of a courtier and that of a poet.
178,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"He often began his panegyrics with much fervour, but the fit passed, or"
179,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"his fastidious taste produced disgust at what he had written, and it was"
180,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"either not finished, or was delayed till the interest of the occasion"
181,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,had passed away.
182,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
183,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"After the death of James I., Charles called a new parliament in 1625,"
184,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and in it Waller took his place for Chipping-Wycombe, a borough in"
185,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Buckinghamshire. This parliament met in London, but was adjourned to"
186,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Oxford on account of the Plague. In Oxford, it proved refractory to the"
187,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"king's wishes, and refusing to grant him a tithe of the supplies which"
188,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"he demanded, was summarily dismissed. Waller was not re-elected in 1626,"
189,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"when the next parliament was summoned, but secured his return for"
190,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Agmondesham in March 1627. He appears to have been in these years a
191,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"silent senator, taking little interest or share in the debates, but"
192,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,retiring from them to offer the quit-rent of his versicles--a laureate
193,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"without salary, and yet not probably much more sincere than laureates"
194,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"generally are; for although his loyalty was undoubted, his expressions"
195,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,of it in rhyme are often hyperbolical to a degree.
196,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
197,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"In his twenty-sixth year, he married an heiress, the daughter of Mr."
198,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Banks, a wealthy London citizen. In this there was nothing singular but"
199,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the fact, that he, as yet obscure, distanced a rival of great influence,"
200,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"whose suit was supported by royalty--namely, Mr. Crofts, afterwards"
201,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Baron Crofts--gave rather a romantic and adventurous air to the match.
202,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"He retired soon after to Beaconsfield, where he spent some happy years"
203,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"in the enjoyment of domestic society, pursuing, too, his studies under"
204,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the direction of Morley, afterwards Bishop of Winchester, a"
205,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"distinguished scholar of the time, who resided with him. During this"
206,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"period he is said to have read many poets, but to have written little"
207,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"poetry. Although the king, jealous of his subjects, had, in 1632, by a"
208,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"most absurd and arbitrary decree, commanded all the lords and gentry in"
209,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the kingdom to reside on their own estates, Waller did not at the time"
210,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"consider this an exceeding hardship. Indeed, his feelings were on no"
211,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"subject, and under no pressure of circumstances, either very profound or"
212,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,very lasting.
213,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
214,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"His wife died after having borne him a son and a daughter--a son, who"
215,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"did not long survive his mother; and a daughter, who became afterwards"
216,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Mrs. Dormer of Oxfordshire. From under this calamity Waller, yet only"
217,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"thirty years of age, rebounded with characteristic elasticity. He came"
218,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"back, nothing both, to the society he had left, and was soon known to be"
219,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"in quest of a fair lady, whom he has made immortal by the sobriquet of"
220,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Saccharissa. She was the eldest daughter of the Earl of Leicester, and"
221,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,her name was the Lady Dorothy Sidney. This lady was counted beautiful.
222,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Her father was absent in foreign parts. She lived almost alone in
223,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Penshurst. It added to her charms, at least in a poetical eye, that she"
224,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"was descended from Sir Philip Sidney; a man whose name, as the flower of"
225,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"chivalry and the soul of honour, is still ""like ointment poured forth"""
226,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,in the estimation of the world--whose death rises almost to the dignity
227,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and grandeur of a martyrdom--and who has left in his ""Arcadia"" a"
228,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"quaintly decorated, conceived, and unequally chiselled, but true, rich,"
229,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and magnificent monument of his genius. In spite, however, of all"
230,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Waller's tender ditties, of the incense he offered up--not only to"
231,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Dorothy, but to her sister Lady Lucy, and even to her maid Mrs."
232,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Braughton--his goddess was inexorable, and not only rejected, but"
233,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"spurned him from her feet. The poet bore this disappointment, as all"
234,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"poets, Dante hardly excepted, have borne the same: he transferred his"
235,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"affections to another, who, indeed, ere Saccharissa-like the sun had set"
236,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"in the west, had risen like the moon in the east of her lover's"
237,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"admiration, and soon, although only for a short time, possessed the sky"
238,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"alone. This was his Amoret, who is said to have been Lady Sophia Murray."
239,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"The Juliet, however, was not one whit more placable than the Rosalind--"
240,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"she, too, rejected his suit; and this rejection threw Waller, not into"
241,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"despair or melancholy, but into a wide sea of miscellaneous flirtations,"
242,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"with we know not how many Chlorises, Sylvias, Phyllises, and Flavias,"
243,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"all which names stood, it seems, for real persons, and testified to a"
244,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,universality in the poet's affections which is rather ludicrous than
245,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"edifying. His heart was as soft, and shallower than his verse."
246,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
247,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Saccharissa married Lord Spencer, afterwards the Earl of Sunderland, who"
248,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"was killed at the battle of Newbury. After his death, she was united to"
249,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"a Mr. Robert Smythe; and she now lies at Brinton, in Northamptonshire,"
250,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"while her picture continues, from the walls of the gallery at Penshurst,"
251,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"to shed down the soft, languishing, and voluptuous smile which had"
252,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"captivated the passions, if it could hardly be said to have really"
253,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"touched the heart, of her poetical admirer. He not very long after his"
254,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"twofold rejection, consoled himself by marrying a second wife. Her name"
255,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"was Breaux or Bresse; and all we know of her is, that she bore and"
256,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,brought up a great many children.
257,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
258,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"In 1639, the urgencies of the times compelled Charles to call a new"
259,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"parliament, and it was decreed that politics instead of love and song"
260,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,should now for a time engross our poet. And there opened up to him
261,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,unquestionably a noble field of patriotic exertion had he been fully
262,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"adapted for its cultivation--his firmness been equal to his eloquence,"
263,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,and his sincerity to his address--had he been more of a Whig in the good
264,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"old Hampden sense, and less of a trimmer. As it is, he cuts, on the"
265,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"whole, a doubtful figure, and is no great favourite with the partisans"
266,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,of either of the great contending parties. He was again elected member
267,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"for Agmondesham, and when the question came before the House, whether"
268,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the supplies demanded by Strafford should be granted, or the grievances"
269,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"complained of by the Commons should be first redressed, he delivered an"
270,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"oration, trying with considerable dexterity to steer a medium course"
271,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"between the two sides. In this speech, while contending for the"
272,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"constitutional principle advocated by the Commons, and expressing great"
273,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"attachment to his Majesty's person, he maintained that the chief blame"
274,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"of the king's obnoxious measures lay with his clerical advisers, and"
275,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"concluded by moving that the House should first consider the grievances,"
276,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and then grant the royal demand. Charles, who had personally requested"
277,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Waller to second the motion for instantly granting the supplies, was"
278,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"not, we imagine, particularly pleased with his ""volunteer"" laureate's"
279,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,conduct; and his temporary defection did not tend to allay the royal
280,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"fury at the parliament, which burst out forthwith in an act of sudden"
281,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,and wrathful dismissal.
282,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
283,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"This session, called from its extreme brevity the Short Parliament,"
284,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"ended in May. In November met that memorable assembly, destined not to"
285,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"separate till it had outlived a monarchy and a hierarchy, and seen a"
286,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,brewer's son take the sceptre instead of the descendant of a hundred
287,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"kings, the Long Parliament. Waller, again member for Agmondesham, had"
288,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"made himself popular by his speech in the beginning of the year, and was"
289,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,chosen by the Commons to manage the prosecution of Judge Crawley for
290,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"advising the levy of ship-money. He conducted the case with talent,"
291,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"acuteness, and moderation. Soon after, however, as the gulph widened"
292,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"between the king and the parliament, his position became extremely"
293,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"awkward. His understanding on the whole was with the parliament,"
294,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"although he did not approve of some of their measures, but his heart was"
295,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"with the royal cause. He first of all, along with a others (whose"
296,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"example was imitated by Fox and his party during the French Revolution),"
297,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"retired from parliament, but in consequence of the permission or request"
298,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"of the king, he speedily resumed his seat. When Charles put himself in a"
299,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"warlike attitude in August 1642, Waller sent him a present of a thousand"
300,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"broad pieces. Still his plausible language, the tone of moderation which"
301,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"he preserved, and his connexion with Cromwell and Hampden, rendered the"
302,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"popular party unwilling to believe him a traitor to their cause, and he"
303,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"was appointed, after the battle at Edgehill, one of the commissioners"
304,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"who met at Oxford to treat of peace. Here, it is said, that one of those"
305,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,compliments which cost the subtle Charles so little (Waller was last in
306,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"being presented to the king, and his Majesty told him, ""Though last, you"
307,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"are not the lowest nor the least in my favour""), gained over Waller, and"
308,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,suggested to him the scheme of his famous plot. We do not think so
309,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"little of our hero's intellect, or so much of his heart, as to credit"
310,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"this story. Though not aged, he was by far too old to be caught with"
311,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"such chaff. He knew, too, before, Charles' private sentiments towards"
312,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"him, and we incline with some of his biographers to suppose that these"
313,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,words of royalty were simply the signal to Waller to fire the train
314,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,which the king knew right well had already been prepared.
315,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
316,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Poets are in general poor politicians and miserable plotters. They
317,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"seldom, even in verse or fiction, manage a state plot well. Scott, at"
318,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"least, has completely failed in his treatment of the Popish plot in"
319,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""Peveril,"" and they always bungle it in reality. They are either too"
320,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"unsuspicious or too scheming, too shallow or too profound. That mixture"
321,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"of transparency and craft, of simplicity and subtlety, requisite to all"
322,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"deep schemes, and which Poe (himself a confused compound of the genius,"
323,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the simpleton, and the scoundrel) has so admirably exemplified in the"
324,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""Purloined Letter,"" is not often competent to men of imagination and"
325,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,impulse. Waller was not a very creative spirit; but here he was true to
326,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"his class, and failed like a very poet. He had a brother-in-law named"
327,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Tomkins, clerk of the Queen's Council, and possessed of much influence"
328,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"in the city. Consulting together on national affairs, it struck them"
329,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,simultaneously that energetic measures might yet save the court. They
330,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"saw, or thought they saw, a reaction in favour of the royal cause, and"
331,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,they determined to try and unite the royalists together in a peaceful
332,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,but strong combination against the parliament. They appointed
333,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"confidential agents to make out, in the different parishes and wards,"
334,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,lists of those persons who were or were not friendly to their cause; and
335,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"to secure secresy, they prohibited more than three of their party from"
336,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"meeting in one place, and no individual was to reveal the design to more"
337,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"than two others. Lord Conway, fresh from Ireland, joined the"
338,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"confederacy, and probably the counsels of such an ardent soldier served"
339,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"to modify the original purpose, and to give it a military colour."
340,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Meanwhile, Sir Nicholas Crispe, a bolder spirit than Waller, had"
341,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"organised a different scheme in favour of Charles. He had, when a"
342,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"merchant in the city, procured a loan of £100,000 for the king; he had"
343,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,then raised and taken the command of a regiment; he had obtained from
344,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Charles a commission of array, which Lady Aubigny, ignorant of its"
345,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"contents, was to deliver to a gentleman in London. Crispe's plan was"
346,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,bold and comprehensive. He intended to remove the king's children to a
347,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"place of safety, to enlist soldiers, collect magazines, and raise monies"
348,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"by contribution, to release the prisoners committed by the parliament,"
349,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"to arrest some of the leading members in both Houses, to issue"
350,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"declarations, and whenever the conspiracy was ripe, to raise flags at"
351,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Temple Bar, the Exchange, and other central spots."
352,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
353,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,It was impossible that two such plots could escape collision with each
354,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"other--or that either should be long concealed. On the 31st May 1643, a"
355,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"fast-day, Pym is seated in St. Margaret's Church, hearing sermon. A"
356,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,messenger enters and gives him a letter. He reads hastily--communicates
357,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"its intelligence in whispers to those beside him, and hurries out. No"
358,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"time is lost. Pym and his party could not trifle now though they would,"
359,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,and would not though they could. Waller and Tomkins are seized that
360,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"night in their houses, and overwhelmed with fear, confess everything. It"
361,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"is suspected that Waller was betrayed by his sister, Mrs. Price, who was"
362,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"married to a zealous parliamentarian. A strange story is told, that one"
363,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Goode, her chaplain, had stolen some of his papers, and would have got a"
364,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"hold of them all, had not Waller, having DREAMED that his sister was"
365,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"perfidious, risen and secured the rest. Clarendon, on the other hand,"
366,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"says that the discovery was made by a servant of Tomkins, who acted as a"
367,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"spy for the parliament. At all events, they were found out, and, in"
368,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"their terror and pusillanimity, they betrayed their associates. The Duke"
369,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"of Portland and Lord Conway were instantly arrested. Lady Aubigny, too,"
370,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"was imprisoned, but contrived to make her escape to the Hague. Even the"
371,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Earl of Northumberland was involved in the charges which now issued in a
372,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"trembling torrent from the lips of the detected conspirator, who"
373,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"confessed a great deal that could not have been discovered, and offered"
374,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"to reveal the private conversations of ladies of rank, and to betray all"
375,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,and sundry who were in the slightest degree connected with the plot.
376,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Tomkins had somehow got possession of Crispe's commission of array,"
377,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"which he had buried in the garden, but which was now, on his"
378,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"information, dug up. Never did a conspiracy fall to pieces more rapidly,"
379,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"completely, and, for the conspirators, more disgracefully."
380,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
381,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,This discovery proves a windfall to the parliamentary party. Pym hies to
382,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the citizens and apprises them, in one breath, at once of their danger"
383,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and their signal deliverance. The Commons draw up a vow and covenant,"
384,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"expressing their detestation of all such conspiracies, and appoint a day"
385,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,of thanksgiving for the escape of the nation. Meanwhile Waller and
386,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Portland are confronted, when the one repeats his charge and Portland"
387,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"denies it. Conway, too, maintains his innocence, and as Waller is the"
388,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"only evidence against either him or Portland, both are, after a long"
389,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"imprisonment, admitted to bail. Tomkins, Chaloner (the agent of Crispe),"
390,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Hassel (the king's courier between Oxford and London), Alexander Hampden"
391,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"(Waller's cousin), and some subordinate conspirators, are arraigned"
392,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,before a Council of War. Waller feigns himself so ill with remorse of
393,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"conscience, that his trial is put off that he ""may recover his"
394,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"understanding."" Hassel dies the night before the trial. Tomkins and"
395,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Chaloner are hanged before their own doors. Hampden escapes punishment,"
396,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"but is retained in prison, where he dies; and the subordinates just"
397,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"referred to (Blinkorne and White) are pardoned. Northumberland, owing to"
398,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"his rank, is only once examined before the Lords. Those whose names were"
399,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"inserted in the commission of array are treated as malignants, and their"
400,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,estates seized.
401,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
402,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Waller, having received some respite, employed the time in petitioning,"
403,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"flattering, bribing, confessing, beseeching, and in the exercise of"
404,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"every other art by which a mean, cowardly spirit seeks to evade death."
405,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"He appealed from the military jurisdiction to the House of Commons, and"
406,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"was admitted to plead his cause at their bar. His speech was humble,"
407,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"conciliating, and artful, but failed to gain the object. He was expelled"
408,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"from the House, and soon after was sisted before the Court of War, and"
409,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"condemned to die. He was reprieved, however, by Essex, and at the end of"
410,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"a year's imprisonment, the sentence was commuted into a fine of £10,000,"
411,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and banishment for life. He was sent to ""recollect himself in another"
412,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"country."" He had previously expended, it is said, £30,000 in bribes."
413,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
414,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Waller's conduct in this whole matter was a mixture of cowardice and
415,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"meanness. Recollecting his poetical temperament, and the well-known"
416,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"stories of Demosthenes at Cheronea, and Horace at Philippi, we are not"
417,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"disposed to be harsh on his cowardice, but we have no excuse for his"
418,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"meanness. It discovers a want of heart, and an infinite littleness of"
419,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,soul. We can hardly conceive him to have possessed a drop of the blood
420,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"of Hampden or Cromwell in his veins, and cease to wonder why two"
421,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,high-spirited ladies of rank should have spurned the homage of a poetic
422,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"poltroon, whom instinctively they seem to have known to be such, even"
423,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,before he proved it to the world.
424,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
425,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""Infamous, and _not_ contented,"" Waller repairs to the Continent, first"
426,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"to Rouen, then to Switzerland and Italy, in company with his friend"
427,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Evelyn, and, in fine, settles for a season in Paris. Here he keeps open"
428,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"table for the banished royalists, as well as for the French wits, till"
429,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"his means are impaired by his liberality. A middling poet, a pitiful"
430,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"politician, a fickle dangler in affairs of love, Waller was an admirable"
431,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"_host_, and not only gave good dinners and suppers, but flavoured them"
432,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,delicately with compliment and repartee. In Paris he recovered his tone
433,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"of spirits, and, had his money lasted, might have remained there till"
434,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"his dying day. But fines and bribes had exhausted his patrimony, and he"
435,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"was compelled first to sell a property in Bedfordshire, worth more than"
436,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"£1,000 a-year, then to part with his wife's jewels, and in fine to sell"
437,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the last of these, which he called ""the rump jewel."" His family, too,"
438,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"had increased, and added to his incumbrances. His favourite was a"
439,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"daughter, Margaret, born in Rouen, who acted as his amanuensis. At last,"
440,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"through the intercession of his brother-in-law, Scroope, he was"
441,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,permitted to return to England. This was on the 13th of January 1652.
442,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"During all his residence on the Continent, he had continued to amuse"
443,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"himself with poetry, ""in which,"" says Johnson, ""he sometimes speaks of"
444,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the rebels and their usurpation, in the natural language of an honest"
445,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"man."" If this mean that Waller, when he uttered such sentiments, was,"
446,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"for the nonce, sincere, it is quite true; but if the Doctor means that"
447,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Waller was, speaking generally, an honest man, it is not true; and Dr."
448,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Johnson repeatedly signifies, in other parts of his life, that he does"
449,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"not believe it to be true. He speaks, for instance, of the ""exorbitance"
450,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"of his adulation,"" of his ""having lost the esteem of all parties,"" and"
451,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"says, ""It is not possible to read without some contempt and indignation,"
452,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,poems ascribing the highest degree of _power_ and _piety_ to Charles the
453,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"First, and then transferring the same _power_ and _piety_ to Oliver"
454,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Cromwell."" In keeping with this, Bishop Burnet asserts, that ""in the"
455,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"House he was only concerned to say what should make him applauded, and"
456,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"never laid the business of the House to heart."""
457,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
458,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Waller, returning, found his mother still alive at Beaconsfield, where"
459,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Cromwell sometimes visited her; and when she talked in favour of the
460,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"royal cause, would throw napkins at her, and say that he would not"
461,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"dispute with his aunt, although afterwards, as we have seen, her spirit"
462,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,of political intrigue compelled him to make her a prisoner in her own
463,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"house. The poet took up his residence near her at Hall-barn, a house of"
464,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"his own erection, and on the walls of which he hung up a picture of"
465,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Saccharissa, whence he hoped, it may be, draw consolation for the past,"
466,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and inspiration for the future. Here Cromwell, who probably despised"
467,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Waller in his heart, as often men of action despise men of mere literary"
468,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"ability, especially when that ability is not transcendent, but whose cue"
469,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,it was to conciliate all men according to their respective positions and
470,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"capabilities, paid great attention to his kinsman. Waller found Cromwell"
471,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"well acquainted with the ancient historians, and they conversed a good"
472,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"deal on such topics. It is said, that when Waller jeered him on his"
473,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,using the peculiar phraseology of the Puritans in his conversation with
474,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"them, the Protector answered, ""Cousin Waller, I must talk to these men"
475,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"in their own way;"" an anecdote which is sometimes quoted as if it proved"
476,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,that Cromwell had no religion; whereas it only proved that he had at
477,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,heart no cant. It was not as if he had privately avowed infidelity to
478,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"his kinsman. Cromwell found _cant_ prevalent on his stage, just as any"
479,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"great actor of that century found _rant_ on his, and, like the actor, he"
480,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"used it occasionally as a means of gaining his own lofty ends, and as a"
481,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,foil to his own genuine earnestness and power.
482,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
483,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"The Protector, however, seems to have profoundly impressed even Waller's"
484,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,light and fickle mind; and the panegyric which he produced on him in
485,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"1654, is not only the ablest, but seems the sincerest of his"
486,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"productions. He had hitherto been writing about women, courtiers, and"
487,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,kings; but now he had to gird up his loins and write on a man. The piece
488,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"is accordingly as masculine in style, as it is just in appreciation;"
489,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and, with the exception of Milton's glorious sketch in the ""Defensio pro"
490,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"populo Anglicano,"" and Carlyle's lecture in his ""Heroes and"
491,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Hero-worship,"" it is, perhaps, the best encomium ever pronounced on the"
492,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Lord Protector of England--almost worthy of Cromwell's unrivalled merits
493,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and achievements, and more than worthy of Waller's powers. It is said,"
494,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,that when twitted with having written a better panegyric on Cromwell
495,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"than a congratulation to Charles II., he wittily replied, ""You should"
496,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"remember that poets succeed better in fiction than in truth."" Perhaps in"
497,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,this he spoke ironically; certainly the fact was the reverse of his
498,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"words. It is because he has spoken truth in the first, and fiction in"
499,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the second, of productions, that the first is incomparably the better"
500,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,poem. Sketches of character taken from the life are better than those
501,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,where imagination operates on hearsays and on recorded actions. And
502,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,certainly few men had a better opportunity than Waller of seeing in
503,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"private and in undress, and with an eye in which native sagacity was"
504,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"sharpened by prejudices, partly for, partly against, the Man of that"
505,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"century--a man in whom we recognise a union of Roman, Hebrew, and"
506,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"English qualities--the faith of the Jew, the firmness of the Roman, and"
507,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,the homespun simplicity of the Englishman of his own age--in purpose and
508,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"in powers ""an armed angel on a battle-day;"" in manners a plain blunt"
509,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"corporal; and in language always a stammerer, and sometimes a buffoon;"
510,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the middle-class man of his time, with the merits and the defects of his"
511,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"order, but touched with an inspiration as from heaven, lifting him far"
512,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"above all the aristocracy, and all the royalty, and all the literature"
513,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,of his period; who found his one great faculty--inflamed and consecrated
514,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"commonsense--to be more than equal to the subleties, and brilliancies,"
515,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and wit, and eloquence, and taste, and genius, of his thousand"
516,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"opponents--whose crown was a branch of English oak, his sceptre a strong"
517,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"sapling of the same, his throne a mound of turf--who economised matters"
518,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"by being at once king and king's jester, and whose mere _clenched fist_,"
519,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"held up at home or across the waters, saved millions of money, awed"
520,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"despots, encouraged freedom in every part of the world, and had nearly"
521,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,established a pure form of Christianity over Great Britain--who gave his
522,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"country a model of excellence as a man, and as a ruler, simple, severe,"
523,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"ruggedly picturesque, and stupendously original, and solitary as one of"
524,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,the primitive rocks--whose eloquence was uneven and piercing as the
525,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"forked lightning, which is never so terrible as when it falls to pieces"
526,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"--and highest praise of all, whose deeds and character were so great in"
527,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"their sublime simplicity, that the poet, who afterwards sung the"
528,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"hierarchies of heaven, and the anarchies of hell, was fain to sit a"
529,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"humble secretary, recording the thoughts and actions of Cromwell, and"
530,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,felt afterwards that he had been as nobly employed when defending his
531,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"grand defiance of evil and arbitrary power, as when he did"
532,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
533,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""Assert Eternal Providence,"
534,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"And justify the ways of God to man."""
535,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
536,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,We have seen pictured representations of Cromwell and Milton seated
537,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"together at the council-table, in which the painter wished more than to"
538,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,insinuate that Milton was the superior being; but in our judgment the
539,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"advantage was on the other side, and the poet seemed to bear only that"
540,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"relation and proportion to the Protector which the eloquent Raphael, the"
541,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""affable archangel,"" the bard of the war in heaven, does to the Gabriel"
542,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"or the Michael, whose tremendous sword mingled in and all but decided"
543,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,the fray. And we thought what a junction were that of the two powers--of
544,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the sword and the pen, the actor and the recorder, the man to do, and"
545,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,the poet to sing! Waller in his panegyric sees and shews in a few lines
546,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Cromwell's relation to Britain, and that of both to the world:--"
547,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
548,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""Heaven that has placed this island to give law,"
549,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"To balance Europe, and her states to awe,"
550,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"In this conjunction does on Britain smile,"
551,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"_The greatest leader and the greatest isle_."""
552,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
553,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"He saw that in Cromwell, and in Cromwell alone, had the power of Britain"
554,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"come to a point: IT was made, if not to be the governor to be the"
555,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"moderator of the earth, and HE was sent to govern it, to condense its"
556,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"scattered energies, to awe down its warring factions, and to wield all"
557,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,its forces to one good and great end. In him for the first time had the
558,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"wild island, the Bucephalus of the West, found a rider able, by backing,"
559,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"bridling, and curbing him, to give due direction and momentum to his"
560,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"fury, force, and speed."
561,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
562,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"He has scattered some other precious particles of thought in this poem,"
563,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,such as:--
564,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
565,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""Lords of the world's great waste, the ocean, we"
566,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Whole forests send to reign upon the sea."""
567,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
568,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""The Caledonians, arm'd with want and cold."""
569,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
570,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""The states, changed by you,"
571,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Changed like the world's great scene, when without noise,"
572,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"The rising sun night's vulgar lights destroys."""
573,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
574,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""Illustrious acts high raptures do infuse,"
575,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"_And every conqueror creates a Muse_."""
576,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
577,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"When Cromwell died, Waller again lifted up his pen, and indited a short"
578,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"lamentation over his loss. After the Restoration, he was one of the"
579,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,first to read a poetical recantation of his errors in verses addressed
580,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"to Charles II. In 1661 he was returned to parliament for Hastings, in"
581,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Sussex, and sat afterwards at various times for Chipping-Wycombe, and"
582,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Saltash. In parliament, he was rather famed for his lively sallies of"
583,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"wit, than for his logic, sense, or earnestness. In private, his spirits,"
584,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"even without the aid of wine,--which he never drank,--continued to a"
585,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,great age unusually buoyant. As he advanced in life he became more
586,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"religious, and intermixed a vein of devotion with his verse. When"
587,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"eighty-two, he bought a small estate in Coleshill, near his native"
588,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"place, desirous, he said, ""to die, like the stag, where he was roused."""
589,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"His wish, however, was not granted. Seized with tumours in his legs, he"
590,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"went to Windsor to consult Sir Charles Scarborough, then waiting on the"
591,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"king. Sir Charles, at Waller's request to know the ""meaning"" of these"
592,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"swellings, told him that they showed that his ""blood would no longer"
593,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"run."" On this the poet quietly repeated a passage from Virgil, and"
594,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"returned to Beaconsfield to die. Having received the sacrament, and"
595,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"shared it with his children, and expressed his faith in Christianity, he"
596,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,expired on the 21st of October 1687. He was buried in the churchyard of
597,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Beaconsfield. He left five sons and eight daughters. His eldest son
598,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"being an imbecile, Edmund, his second, inherited the estates, and having"
599,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"joined the party of the Prince of Orange, sat for Agmondesham for some"
600,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"years, but became ultimately a Quaker. The fortunes of the rest of his"
601,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"family are not particularly interesting, and need not be related."
602,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
603,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"As a character, our opinion of Waller has been already indicated. He was"
604,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"indecisive, vacillating, with more wit than judgment, and with more"
605,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"judgment than earnestness. In that age of high hearts, stormy passions,"
606,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and determined purpose, he looks helpless and not at home, like a"
607,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"butterfly in an eagle's eyrie. A gifted, accomplished, and apparently an"
608,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"amiable man, he was a feeble, and almost a despicable character. The"
609,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,parliament seem to have thought him hardly worth hanging. Cromwell bore
610,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"with him only as a kinsman, and respected him only as a scholar. Charles"
611,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"II. liked to laugh at his jokes, and to Saville his company was as good"
612,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,as an additional bottle of wine. His only chance of fame as a man of
613,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"action arose from his connexion with the plot, which, however, in its"
614,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"issue covered him with infamy, as all bad things bungled, inevitably do"
615,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,to those who attempt them.
616,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
617,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Although he unquestionably in some points improved our correctness of
618,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"style and our versification, there is not much to be said either for or"
619,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"against his poetry. It is as a whole a mass of smooth and easy, yet"
620,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"systematic, trifling. Nine-tenths of it does not rise above mediocrity,"
621,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,and the tenth that remains is more distinguished by grace than by
622,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,grandeur or depth. His lines on Cromwell we have already characterised.
623,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"It may seem odd, but in his verses on the head of a stag, which Johnson"
624,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"singles out as bad, we see more of the soul of poetry than in any of his"
625,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,other productions.
626,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
627,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Let our readers, if they will not be convinced by our assertion, listen"
628,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,to some of these lines:--
629,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
630,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""So we some antique hero's strength,"
631,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Learn by his lance's weight and length--
632,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,As these vast beams express the beast
633,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Whose shady brows alive they dress'd.
634,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Such game, while yet the world was new,"
635,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,The mighty Nimrod did pursue;
636,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,What huntsman of our feeble race
637,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Or dogs dare such a monster chase?
638,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,*       *       *       *       *
639,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Oh, fertile head, which every year"
640,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Could such a CROP of WONDER bear!"""
641,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
642,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"In his amorous and complimentary ditties, he is often very successful."
643,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"So, too, is he in much of his ""Divine Poetry,"" particularly the lines at"
644,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the end, beginning with--"
645,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
646,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""The soul's dark cottage, batter'd and decay'd,"""
647,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Lets in new light through chinks which time hath made.
648,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
649,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"These contain a thought, so far as we remember, new and highly poetical."
650,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
651,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,We may close by saying a few words on a question which Dr. Johnson has
652,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"started in his ""Life of Waller"" in reference to sacred poetry. That"
653,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"great and good man, our readers remember, maintains that the ideas of"
654,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the Christian theology are too simple for eloquence, too sacred for"
655,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"fiction, and too majestic for ornament, and ""that faith, thanksgiving,"
656,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"repentance, and supplication,"" are all unsusceptible of poetical"
657,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,treatment. He grants that the doctrines of religion may be defended in a
658,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"didactic poem, and that a poet may not only describe God's works in"
659,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"nature, but may trace them up to nature's God. But he asserts that"
660,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""contemplative piety, or the intercourse between God and the human soul,"
661,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"cannot be poetical."" It is curious to remember that, up to Johnson's"
662,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"time, the best poetry in the world had been sacred. There had been the"
663,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"poetry of the Bible, in which truth of the deepest import was expressed,"
664,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"now in ""eloquence,"" now in ""fiction,"" and now in language most"
665,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"gorgeously ""ornamented,"" and in which ""Faith"" in Isaiah, ""Thanksgiving"""
666,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"in Moses, ""Penitence"" in David, and ""Supplication"" in Jeremiah, had"
667,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"uttered themselves in sublime, or lively, or subdued, or tender strains"
668,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"--the poetry of the ""Divine Commedia,"" of the ""Jerusalem Delivered,"" of"
669,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the ""Faery Queen,"" of the ""Paradise Lost"" and ""Paradise Regained,"" of"
670,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the ""Night-Thoughts,"" of ""Smart's David,"" all poetry, let it be"
671,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"observed, not defending religion merely, or confining itself to the"
672,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"praise of God's lower works, but entering into the depths of divine"
673,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"contemplation, into the very adyta of the heavenly temple. And it is no"
674,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,less interesting to recollect that in spite of Dr. Johnson's sage
675,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"diction, sacred poetry of a very high order has, since his day,"
676,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"abounded. Cowper has extracted it from ""the intercourse between God and"
677,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the human soul;"" Montgomery has made now ""the supplication,"" and now the"
678,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""thanksgiving,"" of the poor negro ring in every ear, and vibrate through"
679,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"every heart; Coleridge has expressed, in his sounding and splendid"
680,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"measures, at one time his ""faith,"" and at another his ""repentance;"""
681,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Pollok has with true, although unequal steps, followed Milton and Dante,"
682,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"both into the heaven of heavens, and into the gloom of Gehenna; and"
683,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Wordsworth, Southey, Croly, Milman, Trench, Keble, and a host more have,"
684,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"by their noble religious hymns, shamed the wisdom of the Sadducee, and"
685,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,darkened the glory of the song of the sceptic. Why argue about
686,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,principles while we can appeal to facts? Why shew either the
687,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"probabilities against, or the probabilities for, good sacred poetry,"
688,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"while we see it before us, gushing from a thousand springs, and"
689,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,gladdening every corner of the church and of the world?
690,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
691,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Dr. Johnson says, ""Whatever is great, desirable, or tremendous, is"
692,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,comprised in the name of the Supreme Being. Omnipotence cannot be
693,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"exalted. Infinity cannot be amplified. Perfection cannot be improved."""
694,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"All this is as true as it is pointedly expressed; but though true, it is"
695,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"nothing to the purpose--nay, bears as much against prayer as against"
696,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"poetry. What meant the Psalmist when he said, ""My soul doth magnify the"
697,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Lord?"" Did he aspire to exalt Omnipotence or to amplify perfection? No;"
698,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"but only first to shew his own feeling of their magnitude; and, again,"
699,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,to raise himself a step toward an approximately adequate conception of
700,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the Most High. So in religious poetry. We cannot add to, or exalt God,"
701,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"but we can raise ourselves up nearer to Him, and attain, if not a full"
702,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"understanding, a deeper feeling of the elements of His surpassing"
703,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"excellence and glory. Indeed, as the highest poetry (in Milton, for"
704,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"instance) blossoms into prayer, so the truest prayer, often by"
705,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"insensible gradation, becomes poetry."
706,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
707,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Dr. Johnson says, that ""of sentiments purely religious, the most simple"
708,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"expression is the most sublime."" True, and hence, the best religious"
709,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"poetry is at once sublime and simple. He adds, ""Poetry loses its lustre"
710,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and its power, because it is applied to the decoration of something more"
711,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"excellent than itself."" On this principle, poets should never sing of"
712,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"God's works in nature--of the ocean, or the sun, or the stars--no, nor"
713,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"of the heroic achievements of man's courage, or of the self-sacrifices"
714,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,of his love--for are not all these more excellent than poetry? Dr
715,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Johnson's theory would hush the ""New Song"" itself, and perpetuate that"
716,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"silence which was once in heaven ""for half-an-hour."""
717,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
718,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Long before the Doctor vented this paradox, Cowley, in his preface to"
719,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"his poems, had written the following eloquent and memorable sentences on"
720,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"this subject:--""When I consider how many bright and magnificent subjects"
721,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Scripture affords, and proffers, as it were, to poesy, in the wise"
722,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,managing and illustrating whereof the glory of God Almighty might be
723,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"joined with the singular utility and noblest delight of mankind, it is"
724,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,not without grief and indignation that I behold that divine science
725,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"employing all her inexhaustible riches of wit and eloquence, either in"
726,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"the wicked and beggarly flattering of great persons, or the unmanly"
727,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"idolising of foolish women, or the wretched affectation of scurril"
728,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"laughter, or the confused dreams of senseless fables and metamorphoses."
729,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Amongst all holy and consecrated things which the devil ever stole and
730,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"alienated from the service of the Deity--as altars, temples, sacrifices,"
731,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"prayers, and the like--there is none that he so universally and so long"
732,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"usurped as poetry. It is time to recover it out of the tyrant's hands,"
733,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"and to restore it to the kingdom of God, who is the Father of it. It is"
734,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"time to baptize it in Jordan, for it will never become clean by bathing"
735,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,in the waters of Damascus.
736,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
737,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""What can we imagine more proper for the ornaments of wit and learning"
738,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,in the story of Deucalion than in that of Noah? Why will not the actions
739,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,of Samson afford as plentiful matter as the Labours of Hercules?
740,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"(Perhaps from this Milton took the hint of writing his ""Samson"
741,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"Agonistes."") Why is not Jephtha's daughter as good a woman as Iphigenia?"
742,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,and the friendship of David and Jonathan more worthy celebration than
743,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,that of Theseus and Pirithous? Does not the passage of Moses and the
744,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,Israelites into the Holy Land yield incomparably more poetic variety
745,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"than the voyages of Ulysses and Aeneas? Are the obsolete, threadbare"
746,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"tales of Thebes and Troy half so well stored with great, heroical, and"
747,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"supernatural actions (since verse will needs find or make such), as the"
748,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"wars of Joshua, of the Judges, of David, and divers others? Can all the"
749,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,transformations of the gods give such copious hints to flourish and
750,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"expatiate on as the true miracles of Christ, or of His prophets and"
751,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,apostles? What do I instance in these few particulars? All the books in
752,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,the Bible are either already most admirable and exalted pieces of
753,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"poetry, or are the best materials in the world for it."
754,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
755,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"""Yet,"" he adds with great judiciousness, ""though they be so proper in"
756,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"themselves to be made use of for this purpose, none but a good artist"
757,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"will know how to do it, neither must we think to cut and polish diamonds"
758,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,with so little pains and skill as we do marble. He who can write a
759,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"profane poem well, may write a divine one better; but he who can do that"
760,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"but ill, will do this much worse, and so far from elevating poesy will"
761,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,but abase divinity. The same fertility of invention--the same wisdom of
762,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,disposition--the same judgment in observance of decencies--the same
763,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,lustre and vigour of elocution--the same modesty and majesty of number--
764,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"briefly, the same kind of habit--is required in both, only this latter"
765,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"allows better stuff, and therefore would look more deformedly drest in"
766,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"it."""
767,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,
768,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,The errors of a great author are often more valuable than his sound
769,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"sentiments; because they tend, by the reaction they provoke, and the"
770,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"replies they elicit, to dart new light upon the opposite truths. And so"
771,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,it has been with this dogma of the illustrious Lexicographer. It has led
772,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"to some admirable rejoinders from such pens as those of Montgomery, and"
773,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"of Christopher North, which have not only rebutted Johnson's objections,"
774,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,"but have directed public attention more strongly to the general theme,"
775,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,and served to shed new light upon the nature and province of religious
776,LIFE OF EDMUND WALLER.,poetry.

1196,ANDERO.[1],
1197,ANDERO.[1],
1198,ANDERO.[1],"Now bad his Highness bid farewell to Spain,"
1199,ANDERO.[1],And reach'd the sphere of his own power--the main;
1200,ANDERO.[1],With British bounty in his ship he feasts
1201,ANDERO.[1],"Th' Hesperian princes, his amazed guests,"
1202,ANDERO.[1],To find that watery wilderness exceed
1203,ANDERO.[1],The entertainment of their great Madrid.
1204,ANDERO.[1],"Healths to both kings, attended with the roar"
1205,ANDERO.[1],"Of cannons, echo'd from th'affrighted shore,"
1206,ANDERO.[1],"With loud resemblance of his thunder, prove"
1207,ANDERO.[1],Bacchus the seed of cloud-compelling Jove;                            10
1208,ANDERO.[1],While to his harp divine Arion sings[2]
1209,ANDERO.[1],The loves and conquests of our Albion kings.
1210,ANDERO.[1],
1211,ANDERO.[1],"Of the Fourth Edward was his noble song,"
1212,ANDERO.[1],"Fierce, goodly, valiant, beautiful, and young;"
1213,ANDERO.[1],"He rent the crown from vanquish'd Henry's head,"
1214,ANDERO.[1],"Raised the White Rose, and trampled on the Red;"
1215,ANDERO.[1],"Till love, triumphing o'er the victor's pride,"
1216,ANDERO.[1],Brought Mars and Warwick to the conquer'd side:
1217,ANDERO.[1],"Neglected Warwick (whose bold hand, like Fate,"
1218,ANDERO.[1],Gives and resumes the sceptre of our state)                           20
1219,ANDERO.[1],"Woos for his master; and with double shame,"
1220,ANDERO.[1],"Himself deluded, mocks the princely dame,"
1221,ANDERO.[1],"The Lady Bona, whom just anger burns,"
1222,ANDERO.[1],And foreign war with civil rage returns.
1223,ANDERO.[1],"Ah! spare your swords, where beauty is to blame;"
1224,ANDERO.[1],"Love gave th'affront, and must repair the same;"
1225,ANDERO.[1],"When France shall boast of her, whose conqu'ring eyes"
1226,ANDERO.[1],Have made the best of English hearts their prize;
1227,ANDERO.[1],"Have power to alter the decrees of Fate,"
1228,ANDERO.[1],And change again the counsels of our state.                           30
1229,ANDERO.[1],"What the prophetic Muse intends, alone"
1230,ANDERO.[1],To him that feels the secret wound is known.
1231,ANDERO.[1],"With the sweet sound of this harmonious lay,"
1232,ANDERO.[1],"About the keel delighted dolphins play,"
1233,ANDERO.[1],"Too sure a sign of sea's ensuing rage,"
1234,ANDERO.[1],Which must anon this royal troop engage;
1235,ANDERO.[1],"To whom soft sleep seems more secure and sweet,"
1236,ANDERO.[1],Within the town commanded by our fleet.
1237,ANDERO.[1],"These mighty peers placed in the gilded barge,"
1238,ANDERO.[1],"Proud with the burden of so brave a charge,                           40"
1239,ANDERO.[1],With painted oars the youths begin to sweep
1240,ANDERO.[1],"Neptune's smooth face, and cleave the yielding deep;"
1241,ANDERO.[1],Which soon becomes the seat of sudden war
1242,ANDERO.[1],Between the wind and tide that fiercely jar.
1243,ANDERO.[1],As when a sort[3] of lusty shepherds try
1244,ANDERO.[1],"Their force at football, care of victory"
1245,ANDERO.[1],"Makes them salute so rudely breast to breast,                         47"
1246,ANDERO.[1],That their encounter seems too rough for jest;
1247,ANDERO.[1],"They ply their feet, and still the restless ball,"
1248,ANDERO.[1],"Toss'd to and fro, is urged by them all:"
1249,ANDERO.[1],"So fares the doubtful barge 'twixt tide and winds,"
1250,ANDERO.[1],And like effect of their contention finds.
1251,ANDERO.[1],Yet the bold Britons still securely row'd;
1252,ANDERO.[1],Charles and his virtue was their sacred load;
1253,ANDERO.[1],"Than which a greater pledge Heaven could not give,"
1254,ANDERO.[1],That the good boat this tempest should outlive.
1255,ANDERO.[1],"But storms increase, and now no hope of grace"
1256,ANDERO.[1],"Among them shines, save in the Prince's face;"
1257,ANDERO.[1],"The rest resign their courage, skill, and sight,"
1258,ANDERO.[1],"To danger, horror, and unwelcome night.                               60"
1259,ANDERO.[1],The gentle vessel (wont with state and pride
1260,ANDERO.[1],On the smooth back of silver Thames to ride)
1261,ANDERO.[1],"Wanders astonish'd in the angry main,"
1262,ANDERO.[1],"As Titan's car did, while the golden rein"
1263,ANDERO.[1],"Fill'd the young hand of his adventurous son,[4]"
1264,ANDERO.[1],When the whole world an equal hazard run
1265,ANDERO.[1],"To this of ours, the light of whose desire"
1266,ANDERO.[1],"Waves threaten now, as that was scared by fire."
1267,ANDERO.[1],"Th' impatient sea grows impotent, and raves,"
1268,ANDERO.[1],"That, night assisting, his impetuous waves                            70"
1269,ANDERO.[1],Should find resistance from so light a thing;
1270,ANDERO.[1],"These surges ruin, those our safety bring."
1271,ANDERO.[1],"Th' oppress'd vessel doth the charge abide,"
1272,ANDERO.[1],Only because assail'd on every side;
1273,ANDERO.[1],"So men with rage and passion set on fire,"
1274,ANDERO.[1],"Trembling for haste, impeach their mad desire."
1275,ANDERO.[1],
1276,ANDERO.[1],"The pale Iberians had expired with fear,"
1277,ANDERO.[1],"But that their wonder did divert their care,"
1278,ANDERO.[1],To see the Prince with danger moved no more
1279,ANDERO.[1],Than with the pleasures of their court before;                        80
1280,ANDERO.[1],"Godlike his courage seem'd, whom nor delight"
1281,ANDERO.[1],"Could soften, nor the face of death affright."
1282,ANDERO.[1],"Next to the power of making tempests cease,"
1283,ANDERO.[1],Was in that storm to have so calm a peace.
1284,ANDERO.[1],"Great Maro could no greater tempest feign,"
1285,ANDERO.[1],"When the loud winds usurping on the main,"
1286,ANDERO.[1],For angry Juno labour'd to destroy
1287,ANDERO.[1],The hated relics of confounded Troy;
1288,ANDERO.[1],"His bold Aeneas, on like billows toss'd"
1289,ANDERO.[1],"In a tall ship, and all his country lost,                             90"
1290,ANDERO.[1],"Dissolves with fear; and both his hands upheld,"
1291,ANDERO.[1],Proclaims them happy whom the Greeks had quell'd
1292,ANDERO.[1],"In honourable fight; our hero, set"
1293,ANDERO.[1],"In a small shallop, Fortune in his debt,"
1294,ANDERO.[1],"So near a hope of crowns and sceptres, more"
1295,ANDERO.[1],"Than ever Priam, when he flourish'd, wore;"
1296,ANDERO.[1],"His loins yet full of ungot princes, all"
1297,ANDERO.[1],"His glory in the bud, lets nothing fall"
1298,ANDERO.[1],That argues fear; if any thought annoys
1299,ANDERO.[1],"The gallant youth, 'tis love's untasted joys,                        100"
1300,ANDERO.[1],"And dear remembrance of that fatal glance,"
1301,ANDERO.[1],For which he lately pawn'd his heart[5] in France;
1302,ANDERO.[1],Where he had seen a brighter nymph than she[6]
1303,ANDERO.[1],"That sprung out of his present foe, the sea."
1304,ANDERO.[1],"That noble ardour, more than mortal fire,"
1305,ANDERO.[1],The conquer'd ocean could not make expire;
1306,ANDERO.[1],Nor angry Thetis raise her waves above
1307,ANDERO.[1],Th' heroic Prince's courage or his love;
1308,ANDERO.[1],"'Twas indignation, and not fear he felt,"
1309,ANDERO.[1],The shrine should perish where that image dwelt.
1310,ANDERO.[1],"Ah, Love forbid! the noblest of thy train                            111"
1311,ANDERO.[1],Should not survive to let her know his pain;
1312,ANDERO.[1],"Who nor his peril minding, nor his flame,"
1313,ANDERO.[1],"Is entertain'd with some less serious game,"
1314,ANDERO.[1],"Among the bright nymphs of the Gallic court,"
1315,ANDERO.[1],"All highly born, obsequious to her sport;"
1316,ANDERO.[1],"They roses seem, which in their early pride"
1317,ANDERO.[1],"But half reveal, and half their beauties hide;"
1318,ANDERO.[1],"She the glad morning, which her beams does throw"
1319,ANDERO.[1],"Upon their smiling leaves, and gilds them so;                        120"
1320,ANDERO.[1],"Like bright Aurora, whose refulgent ray"
1321,ANDERO.[1],"Foretells the fervour of ensuing day,"
1322,ANDERO.[1],And warns the shepherd with his flocks retreat
1323,ANDERO.[1],To leafy shadows from the threaten'd heat.
1324,ANDERO.[1],

2244,CANTO II.,"[1] 'Warwick's share': Robert Rich, Earl of Warwick, possessed a portion"

2255,CANTO III.,
2256,CANTO III.,"The boat which, on the first assault did go,"
2257,CANTO III.,Struck with a harping-iron the younger foe;
2258,CANTO III.,"Who, when he felt his side so rudely gored,"
2259,CANTO III.,Loud as the sea that nourished him he roar'd.
2260,CANTO III.,"As a broad bream, to please some curious taste,"
2261,CANTO III.,"While yet alive, in boiling water cast,"
2262,CANTO III.,Vex'd with unwonted heat he flings about
2263,CANTO III.,"The scorching brass, and hurls the liquor out;"
2264,CANTO III.,"So with the barbed jav'lin stung, he raves,"
2265,CANTO III.,And scourges with his tail the suffering waves.                      140

2267,CANTO III.,He threatens ruin with his pond'rous tail;
2268,CANTO III.,"Dissolving at one stroke the batter'd boat,"
2269,CANTO III.,And down the men fall drenched in the moat;
2270,CANTO III.,With every fierce encounter they are forced
2271,CANTO III.,"To quit their boats, and fare like men unhorsed."
2272,CANTO III.,
2273,CANTO III.,"The bigger whale like some huge carrack lay,"
2274,CANTO III.,Which wanteth sea-room with her foes to play;
2275,CANTO III.,"Slowly she swims; and when, provoked, she would"

2277,CANTO III.,"The shallow water doth her force infringe,"
2278,CANTO III.,And renders vain her tail's impetuous swinge;

2280,CANTO III.,"And there, like bees, they all their weapons leave."
2281,CANTO III.,
2282,CANTO III.,"This sees the cub, and does himself oppose"
2283,CANTO III.,Betwixt his cumber'd mother and her foes;
2284,CANTO III.,"With desp'rate courage he receives her wounds,"
2285,CANTO III.,And men and boats his active tail confounds.
2286,CANTO III.,"Their forces join'd, the seas with billows fill,"
2287,CANTO III.,"And make a tempest, though the winds be still.                       160"
2288,CANTO III.,Now would the men with half their hopèd prey
2289,CANTO III.,"Be well content, and wish this cub away;"
2290,CANTO III.,Their wish they have: he (to direct his dam
2291,CANTO III.,Unto the gap through which they thither came)
2292,CANTO III.,"Before her swims, and quits the hostile lake,"
2293,CANTO III.,A pris'ner there but for his mother's sake.
2294,CANTO III.,"She, by the rocks compell'd to stay behind,"
2295,CANTO III.,Is by the vastness of her bulk confined.
2296,CANTO III.,They shout for joy! and now on her alone
2297,CANTO III.,"Their fury falls, and all their darts are thrown.                    170"
2298,CANTO III.,"Their lances spent, one, bolder than the rest,"
2299,CANTO III.,With his broad sword provoked the sluggish beast;
2300,CANTO III.,"Her oily side devours both blade and haft,"
2301,CANTO III.,And there his steel the bold Bermudan left.
2302,CANTO III.,"Courage the rest from his example take,"
2303,CANTO III.,And now they change the colour of the lake;
2304,CANTO III.,"Blood flows in rivers from her wounded side,"
2305,CANTO III.,"As if they would prevent the tardy tide,"
2306,CANTO III.,"And raise the flood to that propitious height,"
2307,CANTO III.,As might convey her from this fatal strait.                          180
2308,CANTO III.,"She swims in blood, and blood does spouting throw"
2309,CANTO III.,"To heaven, that heaven men's cruelties might know."
2310,CANTO III.,"Their fixed jav'lins in her side she wears,"
2311,CANTO III.,And on her back a grove of pikes appears;
2312,CANTO III.,"You would have thought, had you the monster seen"
2313,CANTO III.,"Thus dress'd, she had another island been:"
2314,CANTO III.,"Roaring she tears the air with such a noise,"
2315,CANTO III.,As well resembled the conspiring voice
2316,CANTO III.,"Of routed armies, when the field is won,                             189"
2317,CANTO III.,To reach the ears of her escapèd son.
2318,CANTO III.,"He, though a league removèd from the foe,"
2319,CANTO III.,"Hastes to her aid; the pious Trojan[1] so,"
2320,CANTO III.,"Neglecting for Creusa's life his own,"
2321,CANTO III.,Repeats the danger of the burning town.
2322,CANTO III.,"The men, amazèd, blush to see the seed"
2323,CANTO III.,Of monsters human piety exceed.
2324,CANTO III.,"Well proves this kindness, what the Grecian sung,"
2325,CANTO III.,That love's bright mother from the ocean sprung.
2326,CANTO III.,"Their courage droops, and hopeless now, they wish"
2327,CANTO III.,For composition with th'unconquered fish;                            200
2328,CANTO III.,"So she their weapons would restore again,"
2329,CANTO III.,Through rocks they'd hew her passage to the main.
2330,CANTO III.,But how instructed in each other's mind?
2331,CANTO III.,Or what commerce can men with monsters find?
2332,CANTO III.,"Not daring to approach their wounded foe,"
2333,CANTO III.,"Whom her courageous son protected so,"
2334,CANTO III.,"They charge their muskets, and, with hot desire"
2335,CANTO III.,"Of fell revenge, renew the fight with fire;"
2336,CANTO III.,"Standing aloof, with lead they bruise the scales,"
2337,CANTO III.,And tear the flesh of the incensèd whales.                           210
2338,CANTO III.,"But no success their fierce endeavours found,"
2339,CANTO III.,Nor this way could they give one fatal wound.
2340,CANTO III.,Now to their fort they are about to send
2341,CANTO III.,For the loud engines which their isle defend;
2342,CANTO III.,"But what those pieces framed to batter walls,"
2343,CANTO III.,"Would have effected on those mighty whales,"
2344,CANTO III.,"Great Neptune will not have us know, who sends"
2345,CANTO III.,A tide so high that it relieves his friends.
2346,CANTO III.,And thus they parted with exchange of harms;

8733,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Next to those poets who have exerted an influence on the _matter_,"
8734,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"should be ranked those who have improved the _manner_, of our song. So"
8735,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"that thus the same list may include the names of a Chaucer and a Waller,"
8736,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,of a Milton and a Denham--the more as we suspect none but a true poet
8737,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"can materially improve even a poetical _mode_, can contrive even a new"
8738,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"stirrup to Pegasus, or even to retune the awful organ of Pythia. Neither"
8739,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,Denham nor Waller were great poets; but they have produced lines and
8740,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"verses so good, and have, besides, exerted an influence so considerable"
8741,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"on modern versification, and the style of poetical utterance, that they"
8742,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,are entitled to a highly respectable place amidst the sons of British
8743,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,song.
8744,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,
8745,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Sir John Denham, although thoroughly English both in descent and in"
8746,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"complexion of mind, was born in Dublin in 1615. His father, whose name"
8747,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"also was Sir John (of Little Horseley, in Essex), was, at the time of"
8748,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"our poet's birth, the Chief Baron of Exchequer in Ireland. His mother"
8749,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"was Eleanor More, daughter of Sir Garret More, Baron of Mellefont. Two"
8750,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"years after the son's birth, the father, being made an English Baron of"
8751,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Exchequer, returned to his native country, and educated young John in"
8752,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"London. Thence, at the age of sixteen, he went to study at Oxford, where"
8753,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"he became celebrated rather for dissipation than diligence. He was,"
8754,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"although a youth of imaginative temperament, excessively fond of"
8755,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"gambling; and it was said of him, that he was more given to ""dreams and"
8756,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"dice than to study."" His future eminence might be foreseen by some of"
8757,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"his friends; but, in general, men looked on him rather as an idle and"
8758,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"misled youth of fortune, than as a genius. Three years after, he removed"
8759,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"to Lincoln's Inn, where he continued occasionally to gamble, and was"
8760,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"sometimes punished for his pains, being plundered by more skilful or"
8761,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"unscrupulous gamesters, but did not forget his studies. His conscience,"
8762,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"on one occasion, aroused by a rebuke from a friend, awoke; and, to"
8763,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"confirm the resolutions which it forced upon him, he wrote and published"
8764,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"an ""Essay on Gaming."" In this respect he resembles Sir Richard Steele"
8765,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"when a young soldier, who, in order to cure himself of his dissipations,"
8766,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"wrote and published ""The Christian Hero""--his object being, by drawing"
8767,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"the picture of a character exactly opposite to his own, to commit"
8768,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"himself irrevocably to virtue, and to break down all the bridges between"
8769,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"him and a return to vice. It is, alas! notorious, that Steele's holiness"
8770,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"turned out only to be a FIT, of not much longer duration than a morning"
8771,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"headache, and that the ""Christian Hero"" remains not as a model to which"
8772,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"its author's conduct was ever conformed, but as a severe, self-written"
8773,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,satire on his whole career. And so with Denham. For some time he forsook
8774,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"the gambling-table, and applied his attention partly to law, and partly"
8775,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"to poetry, translating, in 1636, the ""Second Book of the Aeneid;"" but"
8776,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"when his father died, two years afterwards, and left him some thousands,"
8777,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"he rushed again to the dice-box, and melted them as rapidly as the wind"
8778,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,melts the snow of spring.
8779,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,
8780,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"""In 1642 he broke out,"" as Waller remarks of him, ""like the Irish"
8781,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Rebellion, threescore thousand strong, when nobody was aware, or in the"
8782,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"least suspected it,"" in the play of ""Sophy;"" and, sooth to say, like"
8783,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"that rebellion, his outbreak is lawless and irregular, as well as"
8784,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"strong; as in that rebellion, too, there is a rather needless"
8785,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"expenditure of blood. What Byron says of Dr. Polidori's tragedy, is"
8786,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"nearly true of ""Sophy""--"
8787,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,
8788,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"""All stab, and everybody dies."""
8789,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,
8790,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,Nothing can be more horrible and disgusting than many of the incidents.
8791,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,A father suspecting and plotting against a dear and noble son; a son
8792,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"deprived of sight by the command of a father, and meditating in his rage"
8793,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"and revenge the murder of his own favourite daughter, because she is"
8794,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"beloved by his father; and the deaths of both son and father by poison,"
8795,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,administered through means of a courtier who has betrayed both. Such are
8796,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"the main hinges on which the plot of the piece turns. The versification,"
8797,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"too, is exceedingly unequal; sometimes swelling into rather full and"
8798,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"splendid blank verse, and anon shrinking up into lines stunted and"
8799,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"shrivelled, like boughs either touched by frost, or lopped by the axe of"
8800,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"the woodman. Still there are in ""Sophy"" a force of style, a maturity of"
8801,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"mind, an energy of declamation, and, here and there, an appreciation of"
8802,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,Shakspeare--shewn in a generous though hopeless rivalry of his manner--
8803,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"which account for the reception it at first met with, and seem to have"
8804,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,excited in Denham's contemporaries expectations which were never
8805,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"fulfilled. This uprise, as well as that of the Irish (which took place"
8806,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"the year before it), turned out, on the whole, abortive. And yet what"
8807,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"fine lines and sentiments are the following, culled from ""Sophy"" almost"
8808,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,_ad aperturam libri_:--
8809,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,
8810,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"""Fear and guilt"
8811,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Are the same thing, and when our _actions are not_,"

8814,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Upon the globe, a _mathematic point"

8817,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,
8818,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"More gallant actions have been lost, for want of being"
8819,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Completely wicked, than have been performed"
8820,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,By being exactly virtuous. 'Tis hard to be

8832,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"The blinded prince's soliloquy, in the first scene of the fifth act, is"
8833,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,worthy of Shakspeare. We must quote the following lines:--

8835,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"""Reason, my soul's eye, still sees"
8836,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Clearly, and clearer for the want of eyes,"
8837,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,For gazing through the windows of the body
8838,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"It met such several, such distracting objects;"
8839,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,But now confined within itself it sees
8840,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"A strange and unknown world, and there discovers"
8841,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"_Torrents of anger, mountains of ambition,"
8842,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Gulfs of desire, and towers of hope, large giants_,"
8843,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,Monsters and savage beasts; to vanquish these
8844,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Will be a braver conquest, than the old"
8845,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Or the new world."""
8846,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,
8847,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Shortly after the appearance of ""Sophy,"" he was admitted, by the form"
8848,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"then usual, Sheriff of Surrey, and appointed governor of Farnham Castle"
8849,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"for the king; this important post, however, he soon resigned, and"
8850,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"retreated to Oxford, where, in 1643, he published his poem entitled"
8851,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"""Cooper's Hill."" This instantly became popular, and many who might have"
8852,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"seen in ""Sophy"" greater powers than were disclosed in this new effort,"
8853,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"envied its fame, and gave out that he had bought it of a vicar for forty"
8854,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"pounds. For this there was, of course, no proof, and it is only worth"
8855,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"mentioning because it is one of a large class of cases, in which envious"
8856,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"mediocrity, or crushed dulness, or jealous rivalry, has sought to snatch"
8857,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,hard-won laurels from the brow of genius. As if these laurels were so
8858,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"smooth, and so soothing, as always to invite ambition, or as if they"
8859,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,were so flexible as to suit every brow! As if FIRE lurked not sometimes
8860,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"in their leaves, and as if there were not, besides, a nobler jealousy in"
8861,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,the public mind ready to watch and to avenge their misappropriation.
8862,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Certain it is that not only, as Johnson remarks, was the attempt made to"
8863,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"rob Addison of ""Cato,"" and Pope of the ""Essay of Criticism,"" but it has"
8864,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"a hundred times taken place in the history of poetry. Rolt, as we saw in"
8865,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"our late life of Akenside, tried to snatch the honour of writing ""The"
8866,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Pleasures of Imagination"" from its author. Lauder accused Milton of"
8867,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,plundering the Italians wholesale. Scott's early novels have only the
8868,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,other day been most absurdly claimed for his brother Thomas. And
8869,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,notwithstanding Shakspeare's well-known lines over his sepulchre at
8870,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,Stratford--
8871,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,
8872,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"""Bless'd be the man who spares these stones,"
8873,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"But curs'd be he who moves my bones""--"
8874,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,
8875,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"a worse outrage has been recently committed on his memory, than were his"
8876,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"dust, like Wickliffe's, tossed out of his tomb into the Avon--his plays"
8877,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"have been, with as much stupidity as malice, attributed to Lord Bacon!"
8878,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Homer, too, has been found out to be a myth; and we know not if even"
8879,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,Dante's originality has altogether passed unquestioned in this age of
8880,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"disbelief and downpulling; although what brow, save that thunder-scathed"
8881,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"pile, could wear those scorched laurels, and who but the ""man who had"
8882,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"been in hell"" could have written the ""Inferno?"" Worst of all, a class of"
8883,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,writers have of late sought to prove that there is no such thing as
8884,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,originality--that genius means just dexterous borrowing-that the
8885,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"""Appropriation Clause"" is of divine right--and have certainly proved"
8886,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,themselves true to their own principles.
8887,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,
8888,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"In 1647, circumstances brought our poet more closely in connexion with"
8889,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"the royal family, and on one occasion he carried a message from the"
8890,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Queen to King Charles, then in prison. He subsequently conducted, with"
8891,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"great success, the King's correspondence; and in April 1648 he conveyed"
8892,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"the young Duke of York (afterwards James II.) from London to France, and"
8893,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,delivered him to the charge of the Queen and the Prince of Wales. He
8894,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"had, ere leaving Britain, written a translation of Cato-Major on Old"
8895,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Age. While in France, attending on the exiled prince, he wrote a number"
8896,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"of poetical pieces at his master's desire; among others, a song in"
8897,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"honour of an embassy to Poland, which he and Lord Crofts undertook for"
8898,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Charles II., and during which they are said to have collected £10,000"
8899,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,for the royal cause from the Scotchmen who then abounded in that country
8900,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,as travelling merchants or pedlars. Meanwhile his political
8901,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,misdemeanours were punished by the Parliament confiscating the remnant
8902,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"of his estate. In 1652, he returned to England penniless, and was"
8903,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"supported by the Earl of Pembroke. After the Restoration, Charles, more"
8904,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,mindful of him than of many of his friends and the partners of his
8905,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"exile, bestowed on Denham the Surveyorship of the King's Buildings and"
8906,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"the Order of the Bath. The situation of Surveyor, even in his careless"
8907,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"and improvident hands, turned out a lucrative one; for it is said that"
8908,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"he cleared by it no less than £7000. Of his first wife, we hear little"
8909,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"or nothing; but about this time, flushed as he was with prosperity, and"
8910,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"the popularity of the writings he continued to produce, he contracted a"
8911,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"second marriage, which was so far from happy that its consequences led"
8912,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"to a fit of temporary derangement. Butler, then a disappointed and"
8913,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"exacerbated man, was malignant enough to lampoon him for lunacy--an act"
8914,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"which, Dr. Johnson well remarks, ""no provocation could excuse."" It was,"
8915,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"in Fuller's fine old quaint language, ""breaking one whom God had bowed"
8916,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"before."" Our readers will find Butler's squib in our edition of that"
8917,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"poet, vol. ii. p. 200, under the title of ""A Panegyrick on Sir John"
8918,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Denham's Recovery from his Madness."" It is a piece quite unworthy of"
8919,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Butler's powers, and its sting lies principally in charging Denham with"
8920,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"plagiarising ""Cooper's Hill"" and ""Sophy,"" with gambling, and with"
8921,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"overreaching the King as Surveyor of the Public Buildings, and with an"
8922,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,overbearing and quarrelsome temper--but it contains no allusion to his
8923,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,domestic infelicity. Some have hinted that the cause of his insanity lay
8924,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,in jealousy--that Denham suspected his wife to be too intimate with the
8925,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Duke of York--that he poisoned her, and maddened in remorse. Whatever"
8926,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"the cause, the distemper was not of long continuance. He recovered in"
8927,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"time to write some verses on the death of Cowley, which took place in"
8928,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"1667; but in the next year he himself expired, and was buried by the"
8929,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"side of his friend in Westminster Abbey, not very far from Chaucer and"
8930,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,Spencer. His funeral took place on the 19th of March 1668. He had
8931,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,attained the age of fifty-three.
8932,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,
8933,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"This is all we can definitely state of the history of Sir John Denham,"
8934,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,and certainly the light it casts on his character is neither very
8935,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"plentiful nor very pleasing. A gambler in his early days, he became a"
8936,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"political intriguer, an unhappy husband, a maniac, and died in the prime"
8937,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"of life. It need only further be recorded of him, that, according to"
8938,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"some accounts, he first discovered the merits of Milton's ""Paradise"
8939,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Lost,"" and went about with the book new from the press in his hands,"
8940,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"shewing it to everybody, and exclaiming, ""This beats us all, and the"
8941,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"ancients too!"" If this story be true, it says as much for his heart as"
8942,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,his head for the generous disposition which made him praise a political
8943,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"adversary, as for the critical taste which discerned at a glance the"
8944,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"value of the world's greatest poem. On the whole, however, Denham as a"
8945,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,man stands on the same general level with the Cavalier wits in the days
8946,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"of Charles. If he did not rise so high as Cowley, he did not sink so low"
8947,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"as Rochester, or even as Butler."
8948,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,
8949,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"We may now regret, both that he did not live better, and that he did not"
8950,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,write more. He had unquestionably in him greater powers than he ever
8951,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"expressed in his works. These are few, fragmentary, and unequal; but,"
8952,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"nevertheless, must be reckoned productions of no ordinary merit. They"
8953,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"discover a great deal of the body, and not a little of the soul, of"
8954,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"poetry. In the passages we cited from ""Sophy,"" and throughout the whole"
8955,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"of that play, there is a vigorous and profound vein of reflection, as"
8956,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"well as of imagination. Like Shakspeare, although on a scale very much"
8957,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"inferior, he carries on a constant stream of subtle reflection amidst"
8958,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,all the windings of his story; and even the most critical points of the
8959,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"drama are studded with pearls. Coleridge speaks of himself, or some one"
8960,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"else, as wishing to live ""collaterally, or aside, to the onward progress"
8961,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"of society;"" and thus, in the drama, there should ever be, as it were, a"
8962,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"projection, or _alias_, of the author standing collaterally, or aside,"
8963,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"to the bustling incidents and whirling passions, and calmly adding the"
8964,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"commentary of wisdom, as they rush impetuously on. Such essentially was"
8965,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,the chorus of the ancient Greek play; and a similar end is answered in
8966,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Shakspeare by the subtle asides, the glancing bye-lights, which his"
8967,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"wondrous intellect interposes amidst the rapid play of his fancy, the"
8968,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"exuberance of his wit, and the crowded incident and interchange of"
8969,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,passion created by his genius. Some have maintained that the philosophy
8970,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,of a drama should be chiefly confined to the conceptions of the
8971,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"characters, the development of the plot, and the management of the"
8972,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,dialogue--that all the reflection should be molten into the mass of the
8973,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"play, and none of it embossed on the surface; but certainly neither"
8974,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Shakspeare's, nor Schiller's, nor Goethe's dramas answer to this ideal--"
8975,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"all of them, besides the philosophy, so to speak, afoot in the progress"
8976,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"of the story, contain a great deal standing still, quietly lurking in"
8977,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"nooks and corners, and yet exerting a powerful influence on the ultimate"
8978,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"effect and explanation of the whole. And so, according to its own"
8979,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"proportions, it is with Denham's ""Sophy."" Indeed, as we have above"
8980,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"hinted, its power lies more in these interesting individual beauties"
8981,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,than in its general structure.
8982,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,
8983,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"""Cooper's Hill,"" next to ""Sophy,"" is undoubtedly his best production."
8984,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Dr. Johnson calls it the first English specimen of _local_ poetry--i.e.,"
8985,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"of poetry in which a special scene is, through the embellishments of"
8986,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"traditionary recollection, moral reflections, and the power of"
8987,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"association generally, uplifted into a poetical light. This has been"
8988,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"done afterwards by Garth, in his ""Claremont;"" Pope, in his ""Windsor"
8989,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Forest;"" Dyer, in his ""Gronger-hill,"" and a hundred other instances. The"
8990,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"great danger in this class of poems, is lest imported sentiment and"
8991,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"historical reminiscence should overpower the living lineaments, and all"
8992,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,but blot out the memory of the actual landscape. And so it is to some
8993,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"extent in ""Cooper's Hill,"" the scene beheld from which is speedily lost"
8994,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,in a torrent of political reflection and moralising. The well-known
8995,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"lines on the Thames are rhetorical and forcible, but not, we think,"
8996,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,highly poetical:--
8997,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,
8998,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"""Oh, could I flow like thee, and make thy stream"
8999,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"My great example, as it is my theme!"
9000,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Though deep, yet clear, though gentle, yet not dull,"
9001,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full."""
9002,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,
9003,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"The poem closes with another river-picture, which some will admire:--"
9004,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,
9005,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"""When a calm river, raised with sudden rains"
9006,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Or snows dissolved, o'erflows the adjoining plains,"
9007,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"The husbandmen, with high-raised banks, secure"
9008,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"Their greedy hopes, and this he can endure;"
9009,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"But, if with bays and dams they strive to force"
9010,LIFE OF SIR JOHN DENHAM.,"His channel to a new or narrow course,"

9324,COOPER'S HILL.,"Here Nature, whether more intent to please"
9325,COOPER'S HILL.,"Us or herself with strange varieties,"
9326,COOPER'S HILL.,(For things of wonder give no less delight

9328,COOPER'S HILL.,Though these delights from sev'ral causes move;
9329,COOPER'S HILL.,"For so our children, thus our friends, we love),"
9330,COOPER'S HILL.,"Wisely she knew the harmony of things,"
9331,COOPER'S HILL.,"As well as that of sounds, from discord springs."
9332,COOPER'S HILL.,"Such was the discord, which did first disperse"
9333,COOPER'S HILL.,"Form, order, beauty, through the universe;"
9334,COOPER'S HILL.,"While dryness moisture, coldness heat resists,"
9335,COOPER'S HILL.,"All that we have, and that we are, subsists;"
9336,COOPER'S HILL.,"While the steep, horrid roughness of the wood"
9337,COOPER'S HILL.,"Strives with the gentle calmness of the flood,                       210"
9338,COOPER'S HILL.,"Such huge extremes when Nature doth unite,"
9339,COOPER'S HILL.,"Wonder from thence results, from thence delight."
9340,COOPER'S HILL.,"The stream is so transparent, pure, and clear,"
9341,COOPER'S HILL.,"That had the self-enamour'd youth[6] gazed here,"
9342,COOPER'S HILL.,"So fatally deceived he had not been,"
9343,COOPER'S HILL.,"While he the bottom, not his face had seen."
9344,COOPER'S HILL.,But his proud head the airy mountain hides                           217
9345,COOPER'S HILL.,Among the clouds; his shoulders and his sides
9346,COOPER'S HILL.,A shady mantle clothes; his curlèd brows
9347,COOPER'S HILL.,"Frown on the gentle stream, which calmly flows,"
9348,COOPER'S HILL.,While winds and storms his lofty forehead beat:
9349,COOPER'S HILL.,The common fate of all that's high or great.
9350,COOPER'S HILL.,"Low at his foot a spacious plain is placed,"
9351,COOPER'S HILL.,"Between the mountain and the stream embraced,"
9352,COOPER'S HILL.,"Which shade and shelter from the hill derives,"
9353,COOPER'S HILL.,"While the kind river wealth and beauty gives,"
9354,COOPER'S HILL.,And in the mixture of all these appears
9355,COOPER'S HILL.,"Variety, which all the rest endears."
9356,COOPER'S HILL.,This scene had some bold Greek or British bard
9357,COOPER'S HILL.,"Beheld of old, what stories had we heard                             230"
9358,COOPER'S HILL.,"Of fairies, satyrs, and the nymphs their dames,"
9359,COOPER'S HILL.,"Their feasts, their revels, and their am'rous flames?"
9360,COOPER'S HILL.,"'Tis still the same, although their airy shape"
9361,COOPER'S HILL.,All but a quick poetic sight escape.
9362,COOPER'S HILL.,"There Faunus and Sylvanus keep their courts,"
9363,COOPER'S HILL.,And thither all the horned host resorts
9364,COOPER'S HILL.,To graze the ranker mead; that noble herd
9365,COOPER'S HILL.,On whose sublime and shady fronts is rear'd
9366,COOPER'S HILL.,"Nature's great masterpiece; to show how soon,"
9367,COOPER'S HILL.,"Great things are made, but sooner are undone.                        240"
9368,COOPER'S HILL.,"Here have I seen the King, when great affairs"
9369,COOPER'S HILL.,"Gave leave to slacken, and unbend his cares,"
9370,COOPER'S HILL.,Attended to the chase by all the flower
9371,COOPER'S HILL.,Of youth whose hopes a nobler prey devour:
9372,COOPER'S HILL.,"Pleasure with praise and danger they would buy,"
9373,COOPER'S HILL.,And wish a foe that would not only fly.
9374,COOPER'S HILL.,"The stag now conscious of his fatal growth,"
9375,COOPER'S HILL.,"At once indulgent to his fear and sloth,"
9376,COOPER'S HILL.,"To some dark covert his retreat had made,"
9377,COOPER'S HILL.,"Where nor man's eye, nor heaven's should invade                      250"
9378,COOPER'S HILL.,His soft repose; when th'unexpected sound
9379,COOPER'S HILL.,"Of dogs, and men, his wakeful ears does wound."
9380,COOPER'S HILL.,"Roused with the noise, he scarce believes his ear,"
9381,COOPER'S HILL.,Willing to think th'illusions of his fear
9382,COOPER'S HILL.,"Had given this false alarm, but straight his view"
9383,COOPER'S HILL.,Confirms that more than all he fears is true.
9384,COOPER'S HILL.,"Betray'd in all his strengths, the wood beset;"
9385,COOPER'S HILL.,"All instruments, all arts of ruin met;"
9386,COOPER'S HILL.,"He calls to mind his strength and then his speed,"
9387,COOPER'S HILL.,"His winged heels, and then his armed head;                           260"
9388,COOPER'S HILL.,"With these t'avoid, with that his fate to meet:"
9389,COOPER'S HILL.,"But fear prevails, and bids him trust his feet."
9390,COOPER'S HILL.,"So fast he flies, that his reviewing eye"
9391,COOPER'S HILL.,"Has lost the chasers, and his ear the cry;"
9392,COOPER'S HILL.,"Exulting, till he finds their nobler sense"
9393,COOPER'S HILL.,Their disproportion'd speed doth recompense;
9394,COOPER'S HILL.,"Then curses his conspiring feet, whose scent"
9395,COOPER'S HILL.,Betrays that safety which their swiftness lent;
9396,COOPER'S HILL.,"Then tries his friends; among the baser herd,"
9397,COOPER'S HILL.,"Where he so lately was obey'd and fear'd,                            270"
9398,COOPER'S HILL.,"His safety seeks; the herd, unkindly wise,"
9399,COOPER'S HILL.,"Or chases him from thence, or from him flies;"
9400,COOPER'S HILL.,"Like a declining statesman, left forlorn"
9401,COOPER'S HILL.,"To his friends' pity, and pursuers' scorn,"
9402,COOPER'S HILL.,"With shame remembers, while himself was one"
9403,COOPER'S HILL.,"Of the same herd, himself the same had done."
9404,COOPER'S HILL.,"Thence to the coverts and the conscious groves,"
9405,COOPER'S HILL.,The scenes of his past triumphs and his loves;
9406,COOPER'S HILL.,Sadly surveying where he ranged alone
9407,COOPER'S HILL.,"Prince of the soil, and all the herd his own,                        280"
9408,COOPER'S HILL.,And like a bold knight-errant did proclaim.
9409,COOPER'S HILL.,"Combat to all, and bore away the dame,"
9410,COOPER'S HILL.,And taught the woods to echo to the stream
9411,COOPER'S HILL.,"His dreadful challenge, and his clashing beam;"
9412,COOPER'S HILL.,Yet faintly now declines the fatal strife;
9413,COOPER'S HILL.,So much his love was dearer than his life.
9414,COOPER'S HILL.,"Now every leaf, and every moving breath"
9415,COOPER'S HILL.,"Presents a foe, and every foe a death."
9416,COOPER'S HILL.,"Wearied, forsaken, and pursued, at last"
9417,COOPER'S HILL.,"All safety in despair of safety placed,                              290"
9418,COOPER'S HILL.,"Courage he thence resumes, resolved to bear"
9419,COOPER'S HILL.,"All their assaults, since 'tis in vain to fear."
9420,COOPER'S HILL.,"And now, too late, he wishes for the fight"
9421,COOPER'S HILL.,That strength he wasted in ignoble flight:
9422,COOPER'S HILL.,"But when he sees the eager chase renew'd,"
9423,COOPER'S HILL.,"Himself by dogs, the dogs by men pursued,"
9424,COOPER'S HILL.,"He straight revokes his bold resolve, and more"
9425,COOPER'S HILL.,Repents his courage than his fear before;
9426,COOPER'S HILL.,"Finds that uncertain ways unsafest are,"
9427,COOPER'S HILL.,And doubt a greater mischief than despair.                           300
9428,COOPER'S HILL.,"Then to the stream, when neither friends, nor force,"
9429,COOPER'S HILL.,"Nor speed, nor art, avail, he shapes his course;"
9430,COOPER'S HILL.,Thinks not their rage so desperate to assay
9431,COOPER'S HILL.,An element more merciless than they.
9432,COOPER'S HILL.,"But fearless they pursue, nor can the flood"
9433,COOPER'S HILL.,Quench their dire thirst; alas! they thirst for blood.
9434,COOPER'S HILL.,"So t'wards a ship the oar-finn'd galleys ply,"
9435,COOPER'S HILL.,"Which, wanting sea to ride, or wind to fly,"
9436,COOPER'S HILL.,Stands but to fall revenged on those that dare
9437,COOPER'S HILL.,Tempt the last fury of extreme despair.                              310
9438,COOPER'S HILL.,"So fares the stag, among th'enraged hounds,"
9439,COOPER'S HILL.,"Repels their force, and wounds returns for wounds;"
9440,COOPER'S HILL.,"And as a hero, whom his baser foes"
9441,COOPER'S HILL.,"In troops surround, now these assails, now those,"
9442,COOPER'S HILL.,"Though prodigal of life, disdains to die"
9443,COOPER'S HILL.,By common hands; but if he can descry
9444,COOPER'S HILL.,"Some nobler foe approach, to him he calls,"
9445,COOPER'S HILL.,"And begs his fate, and then contented falls."
9446,COOPER'S HILL.,So when the king a mortal shaft lets fly                             319
9447,COOPER'S HILL.,"From his unerring hand, then glad to die,"
9448,COOPER'S HILL.,"Proud of the wound, to it resigns his blood,"
9449,COOPER'S HILL.,And stains the crystal with a purple flood.
9450,COOPER'S HILL.,"This a more innocent, and happy chase,"
9451,COOPER'S HILL.,"Than when of old, but in the selfsame place,"
9452,COOPER'S HILL.,"Fair Liberty pursued,[7] and meant a prey"
9453,COOPER'S HILL.,"To lawless power, here turn'd, and stood at bay;"
9454,COOPER'S HILL.,When in that remedy all hope was placed
9455,COOPER'S HILL.,"Which was, or should have been at least, the last."
9456,COOPER'S HILL.,"Here was that charter seal'd, wherein the crown"
9457,COOPER'S HILL.,All marks of arbitrary power lays down:                              330
9458,COOPER'S HILL.,"Tyrant and slave, those names of hate and fear,"
9459,COOPER'S HILL.,The happier style of king and subject bear:
9460,COOPER'S HILL.,"Happy, when both to the same centre move,"
9461,COOPER'S HILL.,"When kings give liberty, and subjects love."
9462,COOPER'S HILL.,Therefore not long in force this charter stood;
9463,COOPER'S HILL.,"Wanting that seal, it must be seal'd in blood."
9464,COOPER'S HILL.,"The subjects arm'd, the more their princes gave,"
9465,COOPER'S HILL.,Th' advantage only took the more to crave;
9466,COOPER'S HILL.,"Till kings by giving, give themselves away,"
9467,COOPER'S HILL.,"And e'en that power, that should deny, betray.                       340"
9468,COOPER'S HILL.,"'Who gives constrain'd, but his own fear reviles,"
9469,COOPER'S HILL.,"Not thank'd, but scorn'd; nor are they gifts, but spoils.'"
9470,COOPER'S HILL.,"Thus kings, by grasping more than they could hold,"
9471,COOPER'S HILL.,"First made their subjects, by oppression, bold:"
9472,COOPER'S HILL.,"And popular sway, by forcing kings to give"
9473,COOPER'S HILL.,"More than was fit for subjects to receive,"
9474,COOPER'S HILL.,Ran to the same extremes; and one excess
9475,COOPER'S HILL.,"Made both, by striving to be greater, less."
9476,COOPER'S HILL.,"When a calm river, raised with sudden rains,"
9477,COOPER'S HILL.,"Or snows dissolved, o'erflows th'adjoining plains,                   350"
9478,COOPER'S HILL.,The husbandmen with high raised banks secure
9479,COOPER'S HILL.,"Their greedy hopes, and this he can endure;"
9480,COOPER'S HILL.,But if with bays and dams they strive to force
9481,COOPER'S HILL.,"His channel to a new, or narrow course;"
9482,COOPER'S HILL.,"No longer then within his banks he dwells,"
9483,COOPER'S HILL.,"First to a torrent, then a deluge, swells;"

9640,THE ARGUMENT.,Me for the sacrifice; the people join'd
9641,THE ARGUMENT.,"In glad consent, and all their common fear"
9642,THE ARGUMENT.,"Determine in my fate. The day drew near,"
9643,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sacred rites prepared, my temples crown'd                        130"
9644,THE ARGUMENT.,With holy wreaths; then I confess I found
9645,THE ARGUMENT.,"The means to my escape; my bonds I brake,"
9646,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fled from my guards, and in a muddy lake"
9647,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amongst the sedges all the night lay hid,"
9648,THE ARGUMENT.,Till they their sails had hoist (if so they did).
9649,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now, alas! no hope remains for me"
9650,THE ARGUMENT.,"My home, my father, and my sons to see,"
9651,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom they, enraged, will kill for my offence,"

9657,THE ARGUMENT.,And now true pity in exchange he finds
9658,THE ARGUMENT.,"For his false tears, his tongue his hands unbinds."
9659,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then spake the king, 'Be ours, whoe'er thou art;"
9660,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forget the Greeks. But first the truth impart,"

9686,THE ARGUMENT.,"And re-convey their gods from Argos' shore,"
9687,THE ARGUMENT.,"Calchas persuades, till then we urge in vain"
9688,THE ARGUMENT.,The fate of Troy. To measure back the main
9689,THE ARGUMENT.,"They all consent, but to return again,"
9690,THE ARGUMENT.,When reinforced with aids of gods and men.
9691,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus Calchas; then instead of that, this pile"

9694,THE ARGUMENT.,"To this vast height and monstrous stature built,"

9707,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor ten years' conflict, nor a thousand sail."
9708,THE ARGUMENT.,"This seconded by a most sad portent,"
9709,THE ARGUMENT.,Which credit to the first imposture lent;
9710,THE ARGUMENT.,"Laocoon, Neptune's priest, upon the day"
9711,THE ARGUMENT.,"Devoted to that god, a bull did slay;"
9712,THE ARGUMENT.,"When two prodigious serpents were descried,"

9717,THE ARGUMENT.,And 'gainst the shore the breaking billows force.

9720,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amazed we fly, directly in a line"
9721,THE ARGUMENT.,"Laocoon they pursue, and first entwine"

9725,THE ARGUMENT.,"His neck twice compassing, and twice his waist:"
9726,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their pois'nous knots he strives to break and tear,"
9727,THE ARGUMENT.,While slime and blood his sacred wreaths besmear;

9733,THE ARGUMENT.,"We, in our fears, conclude this fate was sent"

9736,THE ARGUMENT.,"The goddess, and let in the fatal horse,"
9737,THE ARGUMENT.,We all consent.
9738,THE ARGUMENT.,
9739,THE ARGUMENT.,"A spacious breach we make, and Troy's proud wall"
9740,THE ARGUMENT.,"Built by the gods, by our own hands doth fall;"
9741,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, all their help to their own ruin give,"

9745,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some dance, some hale the rope; at last let down                     230"
9746,THE ARGUMENT.,It enters with a thund'ring noise the town.
9747,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oh Troy! the seat of gods, in war renown'd!"
9748,THE ARGUMENT.,Three times it struck; as oft the clashing sound
9749,THE ARGUMENT.,Of arms was heard; yet blinded by the power
9750,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Fate, we place it in the sacred tower."
9751,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cassandra then foretells th'event, but she"

9762,THE ARGUMENT.,When Sinon (saved by the gods' partial power)

9766,THE ARGUMENT.,"Down by a rope, Machaon was their guide;"

9770,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oppress'd, surprise, and then their forces join."
9771,THE ARGUMENT.,"'Twas then, when the first sweets of sleep repair"

9775,THE ARGUMENT.,"His aspect such when, soil'd with bloody dust,                       260"
9776,THE ARGUMENT.,Dragg'd by the cords which through his feet were thrust
9777,THE ARGUMENT.,"By his insulting foe; oh, how transform'd,"
9778,THE ARGUMENT.,"How much unlike that Hector, who return'd"
9779,THE ARGUMENT.,"Clad in Achilles' spoils! when he, among"
9780,THE ARGUMENT.,A thousand ships (like Jove) his lightning flung!
9781,THE ARGUMENT.,His horrid beard and knotted tresses stood
9782,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stiff with his gore, and all his wounds ran blood:"
9783,THE ARGUMENT.,"Entranced I lay, then (weeping) said, 'The joy,"
9784,THE ARGUMENT.,The hope and stay of thy declining Troy!

9786,THE ARGUMENT.,"Art thou restored to us, consumed and tired"

9788,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy once fair looks, or why appear those wounds?'"
9789,THE ARGUMENT.,"Regardless of my words, he no reply"
9790,THE ARGUMENT.,"Returns, but with a dreadful groan doth cry,"
9791,THE ARGUMENT.,"'Fly from the flame, O goddess-born! our walls"

9799,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then brings old Vesta from her sacred choir,"
9800,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her holy wreaths, and her eternal fire."
9801,THE ARGUMENT.,Meanwhile the walls with doubtful cries resound
9802,THE ARGUMENT.,From far (for shady coverts did surround
9803,THE ARGUMENT.,"My father's house); approaching still more near,"
9804,THE ARGUMENT.,"The clash of arms, and voice of men we hear:"
9805,THE ARGUMENT.,"Roused from my bed, I speedily ascend                                290"
9806,THE ARGUMENT.,"The houses' tops, and listening there attend."
9807,THE ARGUMENT.,"As flames roll'd by the winds' conspiring force,"
9808,THE ARGUMENT.,"O'er full-ear'd corn, or torrent's raging course"

9812,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such my surprise, and such their rage appears."
9813,THE ARGUMENT.,"First fell thy house, Ucalegon! then thine"

9817,THE ARGUMENT.,"Give me my arms, I cried, resolved to throw"

9820,THE ARGUMENT.,"That of all deaths, to die in arms was best."
9821,THE ARGUMENT.,"The first I met was Pantheus, Phoebus' priest,"
9822,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, 'scaping with his gods and relics, fled,"
9823,THE ARGUMENT.,And t'wards the shore his little grandchild led;

9826,THE ARGUMENT.,"Trojans we were, and mighty Ilium was;"
9827,THE ARGUMENT.,But the last period and the fatal hour
9828,THE ARGUMENT.,Of Troy is come: our glory and our power
9829,THE ARGUMENT.,Incensèd Jove transfers to Grecian hands;
9830,THE ARGUMENT.,The foe within the burning town commands;
9831,THE ARGUMENT.,And (like a smother'd fire) an unseen force
9832,THE ARGUMENT.,Breaks from the bowels of the fatal horse:
9833,THE ARGUMENT.,"Insulting Sinon flings about the flame,"
9834,THE ARGUMENT.,And thousands more than e'er from Argos came
9835,THE ARGUMENT.,"Possess the gates, the passes, and the streets,                      320"
9836,THE ARGUMENT.,"And these the sword o'ertakes, and those it meets."
9837,THE ARGUMENT.,The guard nor fights nor flies; their fate so near
9838,THE ARGUMENT.,At once suspends their courage and their fear.'--
9839,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus by the gods, and by Atrides' words"
9840,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inspir'd, I make my way through fire, through swords,"
9841,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where noises, tumults, outcries, and alarms"
9842,THE ARGUMENT.,"I heard; first Iphitus, renown'd for arms,"
9843,THE ARGUMENT.,"We meet, who knew us (for the moon did shine)"
9844,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Ripheus, Hypanis, and Dymas join"
9845,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their force, and young Choroebus, Mygdon's son,                      330"
9846,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, by the love of fair Cassandra won,"
9847,THE ARGUMENT.,Arrived but lately in her father's aid;

9854,THE ARGUMENT.,"You see: the gods have left us, by whose aid"
9855,THE ARGUMENT.,Our empire stood; nor can the flame be stay'd:                       340
9856,THE ARGUMENT.,Then let us fall amidst our foes; this one
9857,THE ARGUMENT.,"Relief the vanquish'd have, to hope for none.'"
9858,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then reinforced, as in a stormy night"
9859,THE ARGUMENT.,Wolves urgèd by their raging appetite
9860,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forage for prey, which their neglected young"

9870,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now the victors fall: on all sides fears,"
9871,THE ARGUMENT.,"Groans, and pale Death in all her shapes appears!"
9872,THE ARGUMENT.,Androgeus first with his whole troop was cast
9873,THE ARGUMENT.,"Upon us, with civility misplaced"
9874,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus greeting us, 'You lose, by your delay,"
9875,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your share, both of the honour and the prey;                         360"
9876,THE ARGUMENT.,Others the spoils of burning Troy convey
9877,THE ARGUMENT.,Back to those ships which you but now forsake.'
9878,THE ARGUMENT.,"We making no return, his sad mistake"
9879,THE ARGUMENT.,Too late he finds; as when an unseen snake
9880,THE ARGUMENT.,"A traveller's unwary foot hath press'd,"
9881,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who trembling starts, when the snake's azure crest,"
9882,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swoll'n with his rising anger, he espies,"
9883,THE ARGUMENT.,So from our view surprised Androgeus flies.
9884,THE ARGUMENT.,But here an easy victory we meet:
9885,THE ARGUMENT.,Fear binds their hands and ignorance their feet.                     370
9886,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whilst fortune our first enterprise did aid,"
9887,THE ARGUMENT.,"Encouraged with success, Choroebus said,"

9892,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then of his arms Androgeus he divests,"

9894,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Ripheus, Dymas, and the rest, all glad"

9896,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus mix'd with Greeks, as if their fortune still"
9897,THE ARGUMENT.,"Follow'd their swords, we fight, pursue, and kill."
9898,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some re-ascend the horse, and he whose sides"
9899,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let forth the valiant, now the coward hides."
9900,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some to their safer guard, their ships, retire;"

9906,THE ARGUMENT.,"Choroebus at the spectacle enraged,"
9907,THE ARGUMENT.,"Flies in amidst the foes: we thus engaged,"

9912,THE ARGUMENT.,"They us for Greeks, and now the Greeks (who knew"

9916,THE ARGUMENT.,"As winds, that meet from sev'ral coasts, contest,"
9917,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their prisons being broke, the south and west,"
9918,THE ARGUMENT.,"And Eurus on his winged coursers borne,"
9919,THE ARGUMENT.,"Triumphing in their speed, the woods are torn,"
9920,THE ARGUMENT.,And chasing Nereus with his trident throws
9921,THE ARGUMENT.,The billows from their bottom; then all those
9922,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who in the dark our fury did escape,"
9923,THE ARGUMENT.,"Returning, know our borrow'd arms and shape,"
9924,THE ARGUMENT.,And diff'ring dialect: then their numbers swell
9925,THE ARGUMENT.,And grow upon us; first Choroebus fell                               410
9926,THE ARGUMENT.,"Before Minerva's altar, next did bleed"
9927,THE ARGUMENT.,"Just Ripheus, whom no Trojan did exceed"

9936,THE ARGUMENT.,"Did, and deserv'd no less, my fate to find."
9937,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now Iphitus with me, and Pelias"

9940,THE ARGUMENT.,"To court the cry directs us, where we found"
9941,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th' assault so hot, as if 'twere only there,"
9942,THE ARGUMENT.,And all the rest secure from foes or fear:
9943,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Greeks the gates approach'd, their targets cast"

9950,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now hopeless, for their last defence they seize."
9951,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gilded roofs, the marks of ancient state,"

9995,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then from the hinge their strokes the gates divorce,                 480"
9996,THE ARGUMENT.,"And where the way they cannot find, they force."
9997,THE ARGUMENT.,Not with such rage a swelling torrent flows
9998,THE ARGUMENT.,"Above his banks, th'opposing dams o'erthrows,"

10016,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not for their fate, but to provoke his own:"
10017,THE ARGUMENT.,There stood an altar open to the view
10018,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of heaven, near which an aged laurel grew,"
10019,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose shady arms the household gods embraced,"
10020,THE ARGUMENT.,Before whose feet the queen herself had cast
10021,THE ARGUMENT.,"With all her daughters, and the Trojan wives,"
10022,THE ARGUMENT.,As doves whom an approaching tempest drives
10023,THE ARGUMENT.,And frights into one flock; but having spied
10024,THE ARGUMENT.,"Old Priam clad in youthful arms, she cried,"

10037,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pyrrhus pursues him, now o'ertakes, now kills,"
10038,THE ARGUMENT.,And his last blood in Priam's presence spills.
10039,THE ARGUMENT.,The king (though him so many deaths enclose)
10040,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor fear, nor grief, but indignation shows;"
10041,THE ARGUMENT.,'The gods requite thee (if within the care

10045,THE ARGUMENT.,Not that Achilles (whom thou feign'st to be                          530
10046,THE ARGUMENT.,Thy father) so inhuman was to me;
10047,THE ARGUMENT.,"He blush'd, when I the rights of arms implored;"
10048,THE ARGUMENT.,"To me my Hector, me to Troy, restored.'"
10049,THE ARGUMENT.,"This said, his feeble arm a jav'lin flung,"
10050,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which on the sounding shield, scarce ent'ring, rung."
10051,THE ARGUMENT.,Then Pyrrhus; 'Go a messenger to hell
10052,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of my black deeds, and to my father tell"
10053,THE ARGUMENT.,The acts of his degen'rate race.' So through
10054,THE ARGUMENT.,His son's warm blood the trembling king he drew
10055,THE ARGUMENT.,To th'altar; in his hair one hand he wreathes;                       540
10056,THE ARGUMENT.,His sword the other in his bosom sheaths.
10057,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus fell the king, who yet surviv'd the state,"

11403,OF PRUDENCE.,"Their difference to measure, and to reach"
11404,OF PRUDENCE.,Reason well rectified must Nature teach.
11405,OF PRUDENCE.,And these high scrutinies are subjects fit
11406,OF PRUDENCE.,For man's all-searching and inquiring wit;
11407,OF PRUDENCE.,That search of knowledge did from Adam flow;
11408,OF PRUDENCE.,Who wants it yet abhors his wants to show.                            10
11409,OF PRUDENCE.,"Wisdom of what herself approves makes choice,"
11410,OF PRUDENCE.,Nor is led captive by the common voice.
11411,OF PRUDENCE.,"Clear-sighted Reason Wisdom's judgment leads,"

11413,OF PRUDENCE.,"That thou to Truth the perfect way may'st know,"

11415,OF PRUDENCE.,"He that the way to honesty will learn,"
11416,OF PRUDENCE.,First what's to be avoided must discern.
11417,OF PRUDENCE.,"Thyself from flatt'ring self-conceit defend,"

11419,OF PRUDENCE.,Some secrets deep in abstruse darkness lie:
11420,OF PRUDENCE.,To search them thou wilt need a piercing eye.
11421,OF PRUDENCE.,"Not rashly therefore to such things assent,"
11422,OF PRUDENCE.,"Which, undeceived, thou after may'st repent;"
11423,OF PRUDENCE.,"Study and time in these must thee instruct,"
11424,OF PRUDENCE.,And others' old experience may conduct.
11425,OF PRUDENCE.,Wisdom herself her ear doth often lend
11426,OF PRUDENCE.,To counsel offer'd by a faithful friend.
11427,OF PRUDENCE.,"In equal scales two doubtful matters lay,"

11463,OF PRUDENCE.,"In vain that husbandman his seed doth sow,"
11464,OF PRUDENCE.,If he his crop not in due season mow.
11465,OF PRUDENCE.,A gen'ral sets his army in array

11469,OF PRUDENCE.,"Yet they who give good counsel praise deserve,"
11470,OF PRUDENCE.,Though in the active part they cannot serve.
11471,OF PRUDENCE.,"In action, learned counsellors their age,"
11472,OF PRUDENCE.,"Profession, or disease, forbids t'engage."
11473,OF PRUDENCE.,"Nor to philosophers is praise denied,"
11474,OF PRUDENCE.,Whose wise instructions after ages guide;
11475,OF PRUDENCE.,Yet vainly most their age in study spend;
11476,OF PRUDENCE.,"No end of writing books, and to no end:"
11477,OF PRUDENCE.,"Beating their brains for strange and hidden things,"
11478,OF PRUDENCE.,"Whose knowledge, nor delight, nor profit brings;                      80"
11479,OF PRUDENCE.,"Themselves with doubts both day and night perplex,"
11480,OF PRUDENCE.,"Nor gentle reader please, or teach, but vex."
11481,OF PRUDENCE.,Books should to one of these four ends conduce--
11482,OF PRUDENCE.,"For wisdom, piety, delight, or use."
11483,OF PRUDENCE.,What need we gaze upon the spangled sky?
11484,OF PRUDENCE.,Or into matter's hidden causes pry?
11485,OF PRUDENCE.,"To describe every city, stream, or hill"
11486,OF PRUDENCE.,"I' th'world, our fancy with vain arts to fill?"
11487,OF PRUDENCE.,"What is't to hear a sophister, that pleads,"

11489,OF PRUDENCE.,"If we were wise, these things we should not mind,"
11490,OF PRUDENCE.,But more delight in easy matters find.
11491,OF PRUDENCE.,"Learn to live well, that thou may'st die so too;"
11492,OF PRUDENCE.,To live and die is all we have to do:
11493,OF PRUDENCE.,"The way (if no digression's made) is even,"
11494,OF PRUDENCE.,"And free access, if we but ask, is given."
11495,OF PRUDENCE.,"Then seek to know those things which make us bless'd,"
11496,OF PRUDENCE.,"And having found them, lock them in thy breast;"
11497,OF PRUDENCE.,"Inquiring then the way, go on, nor slack,"
11498,OF PRUDENCE.,"But mend thy pace, nor think of going back.                          100"
11499,OF PRUDENCE.,"Some their whole age in these inquiries waste,"
11500,OF PRUDENCE.,And die like fools before one step they've pass'd;
11501,OF PRUDENCE.,"'Tis strange to know the way, and not t'advance;"
11502,OF PRUDENCE.,That knowledge is far worse than ignorance.
11503,OF PRUDENCE.,"The learned teach, but what they teach, not do,"

11505,OF PRUDENCE.,"In vain on study time away we throw,"
11506,OF PRUDENCE.,When we forbear to act the things we know.
11507,OF PRUDENCE.,"The soldier that philosopher well blamed,"

11509,OF PRUDENCE.,"'Tell' (said the soldier) 'venerable Sir,"
11510,OF PRUDENCE.,"Why all these words, this clamour, and this stir?"
11511,OF PRUDENCE.,"Why do disputes in wrangling spend the day,"
11512,OF PRUDENCE.,"Whilst one says only yea, and t'other nay?'"
11513,OF PRUDENCE.,"'Oh,' said the doctor, 'we for wisdom toil'd,"
11514,OF PRUDENCE.,For which none toils too much.' The soldier smiled;
11515,OF PRUDENCE.,"'You're gray and old, and to some pious use"
11516,OF PRUDENCE.,This mass of treasure you should now reduce:
11517,OF PRUDENCE.,"But you your store have hoarded in some bank,"
11518,OF PRUDENCE.,For which th'infernal spirits shall you thank.'                      120
11519,OF PRUDENCE.,Let what thou learnest be by practice shown;
11520,OF PRUDENCE.,'Tis said that wisdom's children make her known.
11521,OF PRUDENCE.,"What's good doth open to th'inquirer stand,"
11522,OF PRUDENCE.,And itself offers to th'accepting hand;

11524,OF PRUDENCE.,"Wisdom will end, as well as she begun."
11525,OF PRUDENCE.,"Let early care thy main concerns secure,"
11526,OF PRUDENCE.,Things of less moment may delays endure:
11527,OF PRUDENCE.,"Men do not for their servants first prepare,"
11528,OF PRUDENCE.,And of their wives and children quit the care;                       130
11529,OF PRUDENCE.,"Yet when we're sick, the doctor's fetch'd in haste,"
11530,OF PRUDENCE.,Leaving our great concernment to the last.
11531,OF PRUDENCE.,"When we are well, our hearts are only set"
11532,OF PRUDENCE.,"(Which way we care not) to be rich, or great;"
11533,OF PRUDENCE.,What shall become of all that we have got?
11534,OF PRUDENCE.,We only know that us it follows not;
11535,OF PRUDENCE.,"And what a trifle is a moment's breath,"
11536,OF PRUDENCE.,Laid in the scale with everlasting death!
11537,OF PRUDENCE.,What's time when on eternity we think!                               139
11538,OF PRUDENCE.,A thousand ages in that sea must sink.
11539,OF PRUDENCE.,Time's nothing but a word; a million
11540,OF PRUDENCE.,Is full as far from infinite as one.
11541,OF PRUDENCE.,"To whom thou much dost owe, thou much must pay,"
11542,OF PRUDENCE.,Think on the debt against th'accounting day.
11543,OF PRUDENCE.,"God, who to thee reason and knowledge lent,"
11544,OF PRUDENCE.,Will ask how these two talents have been spent.
11545,OF PRUDENCE.,"Let not low pleasures thy high reason blind,"
11546,OF PRUDENCE.,"He's mad, that seeks what no man e'er could find."
11547,OF PRUDENCE.,"Why should we fondly please our sense, wherein"

11549,OF PRUDENCE.,"What thoughts man's reason better can become,"
11550,OF PRUDENCE.,Than th'expectation of his welcome home?
11551,OF PRUDENCE.,"Lords of the world have but for life their lease,"
11552,OF PRUDENCE.,And that too (if the lessor please) must cease.
11553,OF PRUDENCE.,"Death cancels nature's bonds, but for our deeds"
11554,OF PRUDENCE.,(That debt first paid) a strict account succeeds;
11555,OF PRUDENCE.,"If here not clear'd, no suretyship can bail"
11556,OF PRUDENCE.,Condemned debtors from th'eternal jail;
11557,OF PRUDENCE.,"Christ's blood's our balsam; if that cure us here,"

11559,OF PRUDENCE.,"His yoke is easy when by us embraced,"
11560,OF PRUDENCE.,"But loads and galls, if on our necks 'tis cast."
11561,OF PRUDENCE.,"Be just in all thy actions, and if join'd"
11562,OF PRUDENCE.,"With those that are not, never change thy mind."
11563,OF PRUDENCE.,"If ought obstruct thy course, yet stand not still,"
11564,OF PRUDENCE.,"But wind about, till you have topp'd the hill;"
11565,OF PRUDENCE.,"To the same end men sev'ral paths may tread,"
11566,OF PRUDENCE.,As many doors into one temple lead;
11567,OF PRUDENCE.,"And the same hand into a fist may close,"
11568,OF PRUDENCE.,"Which, instantly a palm expanded shows.                              170"
11569,OF PRUDENCE.,"Justice and faith never forsake the wise,"
11570,OF PRUDENCE.,Yet may occasion put him in disguise;
11571,OF PRUDENCE.,Not turning like the wind; but if the state
11572,OF PRUDENCE.,"Of things must change, he is not obstinate;"
11573,OF PRUDENCE.,"Things past and future with the present weighs,"
11574,OF PRUDENCE.,Nor credulous of what vain rumour says.
11575,OF PRUDENCE.,Few things by wisdom are at first believed;
11576,OF PRUDENCE.,"An easy ear deceives, and is deceived:"
11577,OF PRUDENCE.,"For many truths have often pass'd for lies,"
11578,OF PRUDENCE.,And lies as often put on truth's disguise;                           180
11579,OF PRUDENCE.,"As flattery too oft like friendship shows,"
11580,OF PRUDENCE.,So them who speak plain truth we think our foes.
11581,OF PRUDENCE.,"No quick reply to dubious questions make,"
11582,OF PRUDENCE.,Suspense and caution still prevent mistake.
11583,OF PRUDENCE.,"When any great design thou dost intend,"
11584,OF PRUDENCE.,"Think on the means, the manner, and the end:"
11585,OF PRUDENCE.,All great concernments must delays endure;
11586,OF PRUDENCE.,Rashness and haste make all things unsecure;
11587,OF PRUDENCE.,"And if uncertain thy pretensions be,"
11588,OF PRUDENCE.,Stay till fit time wear out uncertainty;                             190
11589,OF PRUDENCE.,"But if to unjust things thou dost pretend,"
11590,OF PRUDENCE.,Ere they begin let thy pretensions end.
11591,OF PRUDENCE.,Let thy discourse be such that thou may'st give
11592,OF PRUDENCE.,"Profit to others, or from them receive:"
11593,OF PRUDENCE.,Instruct the ignorant; to those that live
11594,OF PRUDENCE.,"Under thy care, good rules and patterns give;"
11595,OF PRUDENCE.,"Nor is't the least of virtues, to relieve"
11596,OF PRUDENCE.,Those whom afflictions or oppressions grieve.
11597,OF PRUDENCE.,Commend but sparingly whom thou dost love:
11598,OF PRUDENCE.,But less condemn whom thou dost not approve;                         200
11599,OF PRUDENCE.,"Thy friend, like flatt'ry, too much praise doth wrong,"
11600,OF PRUDENCE.,And too sharp censure shows an evil tongue:
11601,OF PRUDENCE.,But let inviolate truth be always dear
11602,OF PRUDENCE.,"To thee; e'en before friendship, truth prefer."
11603,OF PRUDENCE.,"Than what thou mean'st to give, still promise less:"
11604,OF PRUDENCE.,Hold fast thy power thy promise to increase.
11605,OF PRUDENCE.,"Look forward what's to come, and back what's past,"
11606,OF PRUDENCE.,Thy life will be with praise and prudence graced:                    208
11607,OF PRUDENCE.,"What loss or gain may follow, thou may'st guess,"
11608,OF PRUDENCE.,Thou then wilt be secure of the success;
11609,OF PRUDENCE.,"Yet be not always on affairs intent,"
11610,OF PRUDENCE.,"But let thy thoughts be easy, and unbent:"
11611,OF PRUDENCE.,"When our minds' eyes are disengaged and free,"
11612,OF PRUDENCE.,"They clearer, farther, and distinctly see;"
11613,OF PRUDENCE.,"They quicken sloth, perplexities untie,"
11614,OF PRUDENCE.,"Make roughness smooth, and hardness mollify;"
11615,OF PRUDENCE.,"And though our hands from labour are released,"
11616,OF PRUDENCE.,Yet our minds find (even when we sleep) no rest.
11617,OF PRUDENCE.,"Search not to find how other men offend,"
11618,OF PRUDENCE.,But by that glass thy own offences mend;                             220
11619,OF PRUDENCE.,"Still seek to learn, yet care not much from whom,"
11620,OF PRUDENCE.,(So it be learning) or from whence it come.
11621,OF PRUDENCE.,"Of thy own actions, others' judgments learn;"
11622,OF PRUDENCE.,"Often by small, great matters we discern:"
11623,OF PRUDENCE.,Youth what man's age is like to be doth show;
11624,OF PRUDENCE.,We may our ends by our beginnings know.

11631,OF PRUDENCE.,"Nor climb on pyramids, which thy head turn round"
11632,OF PRUDENCE.,"Standing, and whence no safe descent is found."
11633,OF PRUDENCE.,In vain his nerves and faculties he strains
11634,OF PRUDENCE.,"To rise, whose raising unsecure remains:"
11635,OF PRUDENCE.,"They whom desert and favour forwards thrust,"
11636,OF PRUDENCE.,"Are wise, when they their measures can adjust."
11637,OF PRUDENCE.,"When well at ease, and happy, live content,"

11655,OF PRUDENCE.,"Who casts out threats and frowns no man deceives,"

12314,THE FIRST PART.,His funeral oration I have seen
12315,THE FIRST PART.,"Often; and when on that I turn my eyes,"

12317,THE FIRST PART.,"Though he in all the people's eyes seem'd great,"
12318,THE FIRST PART.,Yet greater he appear'd in his retreat;
12319,THE FIRST PART.,"When feasting with his private friends at home,"
12320,THE FIRST PART.,"Such counsel, such discourse from him did come,"
12321,THE FIRST PART.,"Such science in his art of augury,"

12327,THE FIRST PART.,"That which is come to pass, and did discern"
12328,THE FIRST PART.,From his survivors I could nothing learn.
12329,THE FIRST PART.,This long discourse was but to let you see
12330,THE FIRST PART.,That his long life could not uneasy be.
12331,THE FIRST PART.,Few like the Fabii or the Scipios are
12332,THE FIRST PART.,"Takers of cities, conquerors in war."
12333,THE FIRST PART.,"Yet others to like happy age arrive,"
12334,THE FIRST PART.,"Who modest, quiet, and with virtue live:"
12335,THE FIRST PART.,"Thus Plato writing his philosophy,"
12336,THE FIRST PART.,With honour after ninety years did die.                              200

12347,THE FIRST PART.,"When the tragedian Nævius did demand,"
12348,THE FIRST PART.,Why did your commonwealth no longer stand?
12349,THE FIRST PART.,"'Twas answer'd, that their senators were new,"
12350,THE FIRST PART.,"Foolish, and young, and such as nothing knew;"
12351,THE FIRST PART.,"Nature to youth hot rashness doth dispense,"
12352,THE FIRST PART.,But with cold prudence age doth recompense.
12353,THE FIRST PART.,"But age, 'tis said, will memory decay,"
12354,THE FIRST PART.,So (if it be not exercised) it may;
12355,THE FIRST PART.,"Or, if by nature it be dull and slow."

12357,THE FIRST PART.,"Of all th'Athenians; and none grow so old,"
12358,THE FIRST PART.,Not to remember where they hid their gold.
12359,THE FIRST PART.,"From age such art of memory we learn,"

12364,THE FIRST PART.,Where wisdom studious industry doth plant.
12365,THE FIRST PART.,"Nor does it only in the active live,"
12366,THE FIRST PART.,But in the quiet and contemplative;                                  230
12367,THE FIRST PART.,When Sophocles (who plays when aged wrote)
12368,THE FIRST PART.,"Was by his sons before the judges brought,"

12377,THE FIRST PART.,Whose constant studies with their age did strive?
12378,THE FIRST PART.,"Nor did they those, though those did them survive."
12379,THE FIRST PART.,"Old husbandmen I at Sabinum know,"
12380,THE FIRST PART.,"Who for another year dig, plough, and sow."

12383,THE FIRST PART.,"Cæcilius vainly said, 'Each day we spend"
12384,THE FIRST PART.,"Discovers something, which must needs offend;'"
12385,THE FIRST PART.,"But sometimes age may pleasant things behold,"

12387,THE FIRST PART.,"This not to age, but youth, who oft'ner see"
12388,THE FIRST PART.,"What not alone offends, but hurts, than we."
12389,THE FIRST PART.,"That, I in him, which he in age condemn'd,"
12390,THE FIRST PART.,"That us it renders odious, and contemn'd."

12395,THE FIRST PART.,"When they with rev'rence follow where we lead,"
12396,THE FIRST PART.,And in straight paths by our directions tread?                       260
12397,THE FIRST PART.,"And e'en my conversation here I see,"
12398,THE FIRST PART.,"As well received by you, as yours by me."

12401,THE FIRST PART.,"In the same studies, the same course to hold;"
12402,THE FIRST PART.,Nor think our reason for new arts too old.
12403,THE FIRST PART.,"Solon the sage his progress never ceased,"
12404,THE FIRST PART.,But still his learning with his days increased;
12405,THE FIRST PART.,"And I with the same greediness did seek,"

12407,THE FIRST PART.,"Which I did only learn, that I might know"
12408,THE FIRST PART.,Those great examples which I follow now:

12420,THE SECOND PART.,'That loss of strength makes understanding weak.'
12421,THE SECOND PART.,"I grieve no more my youthful strength to want,"
12422,THE SECOND PART.,"Than, young, that of a bull, or elephant;"

12425,THE SECOND PART.,"When the young wrestlers at their sport grew warm,"
12426,THE SECOND PART.,"Old Milo wept, to see his naked arm;"
12427,THE SECOND PART.,"And cried, 'twas dead. Trifler! thine heart and head,"

12429,THE SECOND PART.,"This folly every looker on derides,"
12430,THE SECOND PART.,To glory only in thy arms and sides.
12431,THE SECOND PART.,"Our gallant ancestors let fall no tears,"
12432,THE SECOND PART.,Their strength decreasing by increasing years;                       290
12433,THE SECOND PART.,"But they advanced in wisdom every hour,"
12434,THE SECOND PART.,And made the commonwealth advance in power.

12443,THE SECOND PART.,"What's to be done, or not be done, instruct,"
12444,THE SECOND PART.,And to the maxims of good life conduct.
12445,THE SECOND PART.,"Cneius and Publius Scipio, and (that man"
12446,THE SECOND PART.,"Of men) your grandsire, the great African,"
12447,THE SECOND PART.,Were joyful when the flower of noble blood
12448,THE SECOND PART.,"Crowded their dwellings, and attending stood,"
12449,THE SECOND PART.,"Like oracles their counsels to receive,"
12450,THE SECOND PART.,How in their progress they should act and live.

12463,THE SECOND PART.,"I speak not of myself, though none deny"
12464,THE SECOND PART.,"To age, to praise their youth the liberty:"
12465,THE SECOND PART.,"Such an unwasted strength I cannot boast,"
12466,THE SECOND PART.,Yet now my years are eighty-four almost:
12467,THE SECOND PART.,"And though from what it was my strength is far,"
12468,THE SECOND PART.,"Both in the first and second Punic war,"
12469,THE SECOND PART.,"Nor at Thermopylæ, under Glabrio,"

12472,THE SECOND PART.,Of winters quite enervated my strength;                              330
12473,THE SECOND PART.,"And I, my guest, my client, or my friend,"

12481,THE SECOND PART.,"Yet this centurion's doth your's surmount,"

12483,THE SECOND PART.,"Milo when ent'ring the Olympic game,"
12484,THE SECOND PART.,With a huge ox upon his shoulder came.
12485,THE SECOND PART.,"Would you the force of Milo's body find,"
12486,THE SECOND PART.,Rather than of Pythagoras's mind?
12487,THE SECOND PART.,"The force which Nature gives with care retain,"
12488,THE SECOND PART.,"But when decay'd, 'tis folly to complain."
12489,THE SECOND PART.,"In age to wish for youth is full as vain,"
12490,THE SECOND PART.,As for a youth to turn a child again.
12491,THE SECOND PART.,"Simple and certain Nature's ways appear,"
12492,THE SECOND PART.,As she sets forth the seasons of the year.                           350
12493,THE SECOND PART.,"So in all parts of life we find her truth,"
12494,THE SECOND PART.,"Weakness to childhood, rashness to our youth;"
12495,THE SECOND PART.,"To elder years to be discreet and grave,"

12503,THE SECOND PART.,You see how exercise and temperance
12504,THE SECOND PART.,Even to old years a youthful strength advance.
12505,THE SECOND PART.,Our law (because from age our strength retires)
12506,THE SECOND PART.,No duty which belongs to strength requires.
12507,THE SECOND PART.,"But age doth many men so feeble make,"
12508,THE SECOND PART.,That they no great design can undertake;
12509,THE SECOND PART.,"Yet that to age not singly is applied,"
12510,THE SECOND PART.,But to all man's infirmities beside.
12511,THE SECOND PART.,"That Scipio, who adopted you, did fall"
12512,THE SECOND PART.,"Into such pains, he had no health at all;                            370"
12513,THE SECOND PART.,"Who else had equall'd Africanus' parts,"
12514,THE SECOND PART.,Exceeding him in all the lib'ral arts:

12529,THE SECOND PART.,"They're credulous, forgetful, dissolute;"
12530,THE SECOND PART.,"Neither those crimes to age he doth impute,"

12532,THE SECOND PART.,"Lust, petulance, rashness, are in youth more strong                  390"

12540,THE SECOND PART.,"Whom he alone, though old and blind, did guide."
12541,THE SECOND PART.,"Yet his clear-sighted mind was still intent,"

12543,THE SECOND PART.,"By children, servants, neighbours so esteem'd,"
12544,THE SECOND PART.,"He not a master, but a monarch seem'd."

12563,THE SECOND PART.,These exercises for my thoughts I find;
12564,THE SECOND PART.,These labours are the chariots of my mind.

12591,THE THIRD PART.,"Which he, with all designs of art or power,"
12592,THE THIRD PART.,Doth with unbridled appetite devour:
12593,THE THIRD PART.,"And as all poisons seek the noblest part,"
12594,THE THIRD PART.,Pleasure possesses first the head and heart;
12595,THE THIRD PART.,"Intoxicating both by them, she finds,"

12605,THE THIRD PART.,"Age undermines, and will in time surprise"
12606,THE THIRD PART.,"Her strongest forts, and cut off all supplies;"

12626,THE THIRD PART.,But fill'd with conversation and discourse;
12627,THE THIRD PART.,"Which feasts, Convivial Meetings we did name:"
12628,THE THIRD PART.,"Not like the ancient Greeks, who to their shame,                     480"
12629,THE THIRD PART.,"Call'd it a Compotation, not a feast;"
12630,THE THIRD PART.,Declaring the worst part of it the best.
12631,THE THIRD PART.,Those entertainments I did then frequent
12632,THE THIRD PART.,Sometimes with youthful heat and merriment:
12633,THE THIRD PART.,"But now I thank my age, which gives me ease"
12634,THE THIRD PART.,From those excesses; yet myself I please
12635,THE THIRD PART.,With cheerful talk to entertain my guests
12636,THE THIRD PART.,"(Discourses are to age continual feasts),"
12637,THE THIRD PART.,"The love of meat and wine they recompense,"
12638,THE THIRD PART.,"And cheer the mind, as much as those the sense.                      490"
12639,THE THIRD PART.,I'm not more pleased with gravity among
12640,THE THIRD PART.,"The aged, than to be youthful with the young;"
12641,THE THIRD PART.,"Nor 'gainst all pleasures proclaim open war,"
12642,THE THIRD PART.,"To which, in age, some nat'ral motions are."
12643,THE THIRD PART.,And still at my Sabinum I delight
12644,THE THIRD PART.,To treat my neighbours till the depth of night.
12645,THE THIRD PART.,"But we the sense of gust and pleasure want,"
12646,THE THIRD PART.,Which youth at full possesses; this I grant;
12647,THE THIRD PART.,"But age seeks not the things which youth requires,"
12648,THE THIRD PART.,And no man needs that which he not desires.                          500
12649,THE THIRD PART.,When Sophocles was asked if he denied
12650,THE THIRD PART.,"Himself the use of pleasures, he replied,"
12651,THE THIRD PART.,"'I humbly thank th'immortal gods, who me"
12652,THE THIRD PART.,From that fierce tyrant's insolence set free.'
12653,THE THIRD PART.,"But they whom pressing appetites constrain,"
12654,THE THIRD PART.,Grieve when they cannot their desires obtain.
12655,THE THIRD PART.,"Young men the use of pleasure understand,"
12656,THE THIRD PART.,"As of an object new, and near at hand:"
12657,THE THIRD PART.,"Though this stands more remote from age's sight,                     509"
12658,THE THIRD PART.,Yet they behold it not without delight:
12659,THE THIRD PART.,"As ancient soldiers, from their duties eased,"
12660,THE THIRD PART.,With sense of honour and rewards are pleased;
12661,THE THIRD PART.,"So from ambitious hopes and lusts released,"
12662,THE THIRD PART.,Delighted with itself our age doth rest.
12663,THE THIRD PART.,"No part of life's more happy, when with bread"
12664,THE THIRD PART.,Of ancient knowledge and new learning fed;
12665,THE THIRD PART.,"All youthful pleasures by degrees must cease,"
12666,THE THIRD PART.,But those of age even with our years increase.
12667,THE THIRD PART.,"We love not loaded boards and goblets crown'd,"
12668,THE THIRD PART.,But free from surfeits our repose is sound.                          520
12669,THE THIRD PART.,When old Fabricius to the Samnites went
12670,THE THIRD PART.,"Ambassador, from Rome to Pyrrhus sent,"
12671,THE THIRD PART.,"He heard a grave philosopher maintain,"
12672,THE THIRD PART.,That all the actions of our life were vain
12673,THE THIRD PART.,Which with our sense of pleasure not conspired;
12674,THE THIRD PART.,"Fabricius the philosopher desired,"
12675,THE THIRD PART.,"That he to Pyrrhus would that maxim teach,"
12676,THE THIRD PART.,And to the Samnites the same doctrine preach;
12677,THE THIRD PART.,"Then of their conquest he should doubt no more,"
12678,THE THIRD PART.,Whom their own pleasures overcame before.                            530
12679,THE THIRD PART.,"Now into rustic matters I must fall,"
12680,THE THIRD PART.,Which pleasure seems to me the chief of all.
12681,THE THIRD PART.,"Age no impediment to those can give,"
12682,THE THIRD PART.,Who wisely by the rules of Nature live.
12683,THE THIRD PART.,Earth (though our mother) cheerfully obeys
12684,THE THIRD PART.,All the commands her race upon her lays.
12685,THE THIRD PART.,"For whatsoever from our hand she takes,"
12686,THE THIRD PART.,"Greater or less, a vast return she makes."
12687,THE THIRD PART.,"Nor am I only pleased with that resource,"
12688,THE THIRD PART.,"But with her ways, her method, and her force.                        540"
12689,THE THIRD PART.,The seed her bosom (by the plough made fit)
12690,THE THIRD PART.,"Receives, where kindly she embraces it,"
12691,THE THIRD PART.,"Which with her genuine warmth diffused and spread,"
12692,THE THIRD PART.,"Sends forth betimes a green and tender head,"
12693,THE THIRD PART.,"Then gives it motion, life, and nourishment,"
12694,THE THIRD PART.,Which from the root through nerves and veins are sent;
12695,THE THIRD PART.,"Straight in a hollow sheath upright it grows,"
12696,THE THIRD PART.,"And, form receiving, doth itself disclose:"
12697,THE THIRD PART.,"Drawn up in ranks and files, the bearded spikes"
12698,THE THIRD PART.,Guard it from birds as with a stand of pikes.                        550
12699,THE THIRD PART.,"When of the vine I speak, I seem inspired,"
12700,THE THIRD PART.,"And with delight, as with her juice, am fired;"
12701,THE THIRD PART.,"At Nature's godlike power I stand amazed,"
12702,THE THIRD PART.,Which such vast bodies hath from atoms raised.
12703,THE THIRD PART.,"The kernel of a grape, the fig's small grain,"
12704,THE THIRD PART.,Can clothe a mountain and o'ershade a plain:
12705,THE THIRD PART.,"But thou, (dear Vine!) forbid'st me to be long;"
12706,THE THIRD PART.,"Although thy trunk be neither large nor strong,"
12707,THE THIRD PART.,"Nor can thy head (not help'd) itself sublime,"
12708,THE THIRD PART.,"Yet, like a serpent, a tall tree can climb;                          560"
12709,THE THIRD PART.,"Whate'er thy many fingers can entwine,"
12710,THE THIRD PART.,"Proves thy support, and all its strength is thine."
12711,THE THIRD PART.,"Though Nature gave not legs, it gave the hands,"
12712,THE THIRD PART.,By which thy prop the proudest cedar stands:
12713,THE THIRD PART.,"As thou hast hands, so hath thy offspring wings,"
12714,THE THIRD PART.,And to the highest part of mortals springs.
12715,THE THIRD PART.,"But lest thou should'st consume thy wealth in vain,"
12716,THE THIRD PART.,"And starve thyself to feed a num'rous train,"
12717,THE THIRD PART.,Or like the bee (sweet as thy blood) design'd
12718,THE THIRD PART.,"To be destroy'd to propagate his kind,                               570"
12719,THE THIRD PART.,"Lest thy redundant and superfluous juice,"
12720,THE THIRD PART.,"Should fading leaves instead of fruits produce,"
12721,THE THIRD PART.,"The pruner's hand, with letting blood, must quench"
12722,THE THIRD PART.,"Thy heat, and thy exub'rant parts retrench:"
12723,THE THIRD PART.,Then from the joints of thy prolific stem
12724,THE THIRD PART.,"A swelling knot is raisèd (call'd a gem),"
12725,THE THIRD PART.,"Whence, in short space, itself the cluster shows,                    577"
12726,THE THIRD PART.,And from earth's moisture mixed with sunbeams grows.
12727,THE THIRD PART.,"I' th'spring, like youth, it yields an acid taste,"
12728,THE THIRD PART.,"But summer doth, like age, the sourness waste;"
12729,THE THIRD PART.,"Then clothed with leaves, from heat and cold secure,"
12730,THE THIRD PART.,"Like virgins, sweet and beauteous, when mature."
12731,THE THIRD PART.,"On fruits, flowers, herbs, and plants, I long could dwell,"
12732,THE THIRD PART.,"At once to please my eye, my taste, my smell;"
12733,THE THIRD PART.,"My walks of trees, all planted by my hand,"
12734,THE THIRD PART.,Like children of my own begetting stand.
12735,THE THIRD PART.,"To tell the sev'ral natures of each earth,"
12736,THE THIRD PART.,What fruits from each most properly take birth:
12737,THE THIRD PART.,"And with what arts to enrich every mould,"
12738,THE THIRD PART.,"The dry to moisten, and to warm the cold.                            590"
12739,THE THIRD PART.,"But when we graft, or buds inoculate,"
12740,THE THIRD PART.,Nature by art we nobly meliorate;
12741,THE THIRD PART.,"As Orpheus' music wildest beasts did tame,"
12742,THE THIRD PART.,From the sour crab the sweetest apple came:
12743,THE THIRD PART.,"The mother to the daughter goes to school,"
12744,THE THIRD PART.,"The species changed, doth her law overrule;"
12745,THE THIRD PART.,"Nature herself doth from herself depart,"
12746,THE THIRD PART.,(Strange transmigration!) by the power of art.
12747,THE THIRD PART.,How little things give law to great! we see
12748,THE THIRD PART.,The small bud captivates the greatest tree.                          600
12749,THE THIRD PART.,"Here even the power divine we imitate,"
12750,THE THIRD PART.,"And seem not to beget, but to create."
12751,THE THIRD PART.,"Much was I pleased with fowls and beasts, the tame"
12752,THE THIRD PART.,"For food and profit, and the wild for game."
12753,THE THIRD PART.,Excuse me when this pleasant string I touch
12754,THE THIRD PART.,"(For age, of what delights it, speaks too much)."
12755,THE THIRD PART.,"Who twice victorious Pyrrhus conquered,"
12756,THE THIRD PART.,"The Sabines and the Samnites captive led,"
12757,THE THIRD PART.,"Great Curius, his remaining days did spend,"
12758,THE THIRD PART.,And in this happy life his triumphs end.                             610
12759,THE THIRD PART.,"My farm stands near, and when I there retire,"
12760,THE THIRD PART.,"His, and that age's temper I admire:"
12761,THE THIRD PART.,"The Samnites' chief, as by his fire he sate,"
12762,THE THIRD PART.,With a vast sum of gold on him did wait;
12763,THE THIRD PART.,"'Return,' said he, 'your gold I nothing weigh,"
12764,THE THIRD PART.,When those who can command it me obey.'
12765,THE THIRD PART.,"This my assertion proves, he may be old,"
12766,THE THIRD PART.,"And yet not sordid, who refuses gold."
12767,THE THIRD PART.,"In summer to sit still, or walk, I love,"
12768,THE THIRD PART.,"Near a cool fountain, or a shady grove.                              620"
12769,THE THIRD PART.,"What can in winter render more delight,"
12770,THE THIRD PART.,"Than the high sun at noon, and fire at night?"
12771,THE THIRD PART.,"While our old friends and neighbours feast and play,"
12772,THE THIRD PART.,"And with their harmless mirth turn night to day,"
12773,THE THIRD PART.,"Unpurchased plenty our full tables loads,"
12774,THE THIRD PART.,"And part of what they lent, return t'our gods."
12775,THE THIRD PART.,That honour and authority which dwells
12776,THE THIRD PART.,"With age, all pleasures of our youth excels."
12777,THE THIRD PART.,"Observe, that I that age have only praised"
12778,THE THIRD PART.,"Whose pillars were on youth's foundations raised,                    630"
12779,THE THIRD PART.,And that (for which I great applause received)
12780,THE THIRD PART.,As a true maxim hath been since believed.
12781,THE THIRD PART.,"That most unhappy age great pity needs,"
12782,THE THIRD PART.,"Which to defend itself, new matter pleads;"
12783,THE THIRD PART.,"Not from gray hairs authority doth flow,"
12784,THE THIRD PART.,"Nor from bald heads, nor from a wrinkled brow,"
12785,THE THIRD PART.,"But our past life, when virtuously spent,"
12786,THE THIRD PART.,Must to our age those happy fruits present.
12787,THE THIRD PART.,"Those things to age most honourable are,"
12788,THE THIRD PART.,"Which easy, common, and but light appear,                            640"
12789,THE THIRD PART.,"Salutes, consulting, compliment, resort,"
12790,THE THIRD PART.,Crowding attendance to and from the court:
12791,THE THIRD PART.,"And not on Rome alone this honour waits,"
12792,THE THIRD PART.,But on all civil and well-govern'd states.
12793,THE THIRD PART.,"Lysander, pleading in his city's praise,"
12794,THE THIRD PART.,"From thence his strongest argument did raise,"
12795,THE THIRD PART.,"That Sparta did with honour age support,"
12796,THE THIRD PART.,Paying them just respect at stage and court.
12797,THE THIRD PART.,"But at proud Athens youth did age outface,"
12798,THE THIRD PART.,"Nor at the plays would rise, or give them place.                     650"
12799,THE THIRD PART.,When an Athenian stranger of great age
12800,THE THIRD PART.,"Arrived at Sparta, climbing up the stage,"
12801,THE THIRD PART.,"To him the whole assembly rose, and ran"
12802,THE THIRD PART.,"To place and ease this old and rev'rend man,"
12803,THE THIRD PART.,"Who thus his thanks returns, 'Th' Athenians know"
12804,THE THIRD PART.,"What's to be done, but what they know not do.'"
12805,THE THIRD PART.,"Here our great Senate's orders I may quote,"
12806,THE THIRD PART.,The first in age is still the first in vote.
12807,THE THIRD PART.,"Nor honour, nor high birth, nor great command,"
12808,THE THIRD PART.,In competition with great years may stand.                           660
12809,THE THIRD PART.,"Why should our youth's short, transient, pleasures dare"
12810,THE THIRD PART.,With age's lasting honours to compare?
12811,THE THIRD PART.,"On the world's stage, when our applause grows high,"
12812,THE THIRD PART.,"For acting here life's tragic-comedy,"
12813,THE THIRD PART.,"The lookers-on will say we act not well,"
12814,THE THIRD PART.,Unless the last the former scenes excel:
12815,THE THIRD PART.,"But age is froward, uneasy, scrutinous,"
12816,THE THIRD PART.,"Hard to be pleased, and parsimonious;"
12817,THE THIRD PART.,"But all those errors from our manners rise,"
12818,THE THIRD PART.,Not from our years; yet some morosities                              670
12819,THE THIRD PART.,"We must expect, since jealousy belongs"
12820,THE THIRD PART.,"To age, of scorn, and tender sense of wrongs:"
12821,THE THIRD PART.,"Yet these are mollified, or not discern'd,"
12822,THE THIRD PART.,Where civil arts and manners have been learn'd:
12823,THE THIRD PART.,"So the Twins' humours,[2] in our Terence, are"
12824,THE THIRD PART.,"Unlike-this harsh and rude, that smooth and fair."
12825,THE THIRD PART.,"Our nature here is not unlike our wine,                              677"
12826,THE THIRD PART.,"Some sorts, when old, continue brisk and fine;"
12827,THE THIRD PART.,"So age's gravity may seem severe,"
12828,THE THIRD PART.,But nothing harsh or bitter ought t'appear.
12829,THE THIRD PART.,Of age's avarice I cannot see
12830,THE THIRD PART.,"What colour, ground, or reason there should be:"
12831,THE THIRD PART.,"Is it not folly, when the way we ride"
12832,THE THIRD PART.,"Is short, for a long voyage to provide?"
12833,THE THIRD PART.,"To avarice some title youth may own,"
12834,THE THIRD PART.,To reap in autumn what the spring had sown;
12835,THE THIRD PART.,"And, with the providence of bees, or ants,"
12836,THE THIRD PART.,Prevent with summer's plenty winter's wants.
12837,THE THIRD PART.,"But age scarce sows till death stands by to reap,"
12838,THE THIRD PART.,And to a stranger's hand transfers the heap;                         690
12839,THE THIRD PART.,"Afraid to be so once, she's always poor,"
12840,THE THIRD PART.,And to avoid a mischief makes it sure.
12841,THE THIRD PART.,"Such madness, as for fear of death to die,"
12842,THE THIRD PART.,Is to be poor for fear of poverty.

12869,THE FOURTH PART.,"For if all men were old, they would be wise;"
12870,THE FOURTH PART.,"Years and experience our forefathers taught,"

12874,THE FOURTH PART.,"Your hopeful brothers, and my son, to you"
12875,THE FOURTH PART.,"(Scipio) and me, this maxim makes too true:"

12878,THE FOURTH PART.,"But when he sees his airy hopes deceived,"
12879,THE FOURTH PART.,"With grief he says, Who this would have believed?"
12880,THE FOURTH PART.,"We happier are than they, who but desired"
12881,THE FOURTH PART.,To possess that which we long since acquired.
12882,THE FOURTH PART.,What if our age to Nestor's could extend?
12883,THE FOURTH PART.,'Tis vain to think that lasting which must end;

12895,THE FOURTH PART.,Not only the last plaudit to expect;
12896,THE FOURTH PART.,"Yet grieve no more, though long that part should last,"

12898,THE FOURTH PART.,"The spring, like youth, fresh blossoms doth produce,"
12899,THE FOURTH PART.,But autumn makes them ripe and fit for use:

12935,THE FOURTH PART.,His friends not to bewail his funeral;
12936,THE FOURTH PART.,"Your tears for such a death in vain you spend,"

12939,THE FOURTH PART.,But a short space to age it will remain;
12940,THE FOURTH PART.,"On which, without my fears, my wishes wait,"
12941,THE FOURTH PART.,But tim'rous youth on this should meditate:
12942,THE FOURTH PART.,"Who for light pleasure this advice rejects,"
12943,THE FOURTH PART.,"Finds little, when his thoughts he recollects."
12944,THE FOURTH PART.,Our death (though not its certain date) we know;
12945,THE FOURTH PART.,"Nor whether it may be this night, or no:"
12946,THE FOURTH PART.,"How then can they contented live, who fear"
12947,THE FOURTH PART.,"A danger certain, and none knows how near?                           790"
12948,THE FOURTH PART.,"They err, who for the fear of death dispute,"
12949,THE FOURTH PART.,Our gallant actions this mistake confute.
12950,THE FOURTH PART.,"Thee, Brutus! Rome's first martyr I must name;"
12951,THE FOURTH PART.,The Curtii bravely dived the gulf of flame:
12952,THE FOURTH PART.,"Attilius sacrificed himself, to save"
12953,THE FOURTH PART.,"That faith, which to his barb'rous foes he gave;"
12954,THE FOURTH PART.,"With the two Scipios did thy uncle fall,"
12955,THE FOURTH PART.,Rather than fly from conqu'ring Hannibal.
12956,THE FOURTH PART.,The great Marcellus (who restorèd Rome)
12957,THE FOURTH PART.,His greatest foes with honour did entomb.                            800
12958,THE FOURTH PART.,Their lives how many of our legions threw
12959,THE FOURTH PART.,"Into the breach, whence no return they knew?"
12960,THE FOURTH PART.,"Must then the wise, the old, the learned fear,"
12961,THE FOURTH PART.,"What not the rude, the young, th'unlearn'd forbear?"
12962,THE FOURTH PART.,"Satiety from all things else doth come,"
12963,THE FOURTH PART.,Then life must to itself grow wearisome.
12964,THE FOURTH PART.,"Those trifles wherein children take delight,"
12965,THE FOURTH PART.,Grow nauseous to the young man's appetite;
12966,THE FOURTH PART.,And from those gaieties our youth requires
12967,THE FOURTH PART.,"To exercise their minds, our age retires.                            810"
12968,THE FOURTH PART.,"And when the last delights of age shall die,"
12969,THE FOURTH PART.,Life in itself will find satiety.
12970,THE FOURTH PART.,"Now you (my friends) my sense of death shall hear,"
12971,THE FOURTH PART.,"Which I can well describe, for he stands near."
12972,THE FOURTH PART.,"Your father, Lælius, and your's, Scipio,"
12973,THE FOURTH PART.,"My friends, and men of honour, I did know;"
12974,THE FOURTH PART.,"As certainly as we must die, they live"
12975,THE FOURTH PART.,That life which justly may that name receive:
12976,THE FOURTH PART.,"Till from these prisons of our flesh released,"
12977,THE FOURTH PART.,Our souls with heavy burdens lie oppress'd;                          820
12978,THE FOURTH PART.,"Which part of man from heaven falling down,"
12979,THE FOURTH PART.,"Earth, in her low abyss, doth hide and drown,"
12980,THE FOURTH PART.,"A place so dark to the celestial light,"
12981,THE FOURTH PART.,"And pure, eternal fire's quite opposite,"
12982,THE FOURTH PART.,The gods through human bodies did disperse
12983,THE FOURTH PART.,"An heavenly soul, to guide this universe,"
12984,THE FOURTH PART.,"That man, when he of heavenly bodies saw"
12985,THE FOURTH PART.,"The order, might from thence a pattern draw:"
12986,THE FOURTH PART.,"Nor this to me did my own dictates show,"
12987,THE FOURTH PART.,But to the old philosophers I owe.                                   830
12988,THE FOURTH PART.,"I heard Pythagoras, and those who came"
12989,THE FOURTH PART.,"With him, and from our country took their name;"
12990,THE FOURTH PART.,"Who never doubted but the beams divine,"
12991,THE FOURTH PART.,"Derived from gods, in mortal breasts did shine."
12992,THE FOURTH PART.,Nor from my knowledge did the ancients hide
12993,THE FOURTH PART.,What Socrates declared the hour he died;
12994,THE FOURTH PART.,"He th'immortality of souls proclaim'd,"
12995,THE FOURTH PART.,(Whom th'oracle of men the wisest named)
12996,THE FOURTH PART.,Why should we doubt of that whereof our sense
12997,THE FOURTH PART.,Finds demonstration from experience?                                 840
12998,THE FOURTH PART.,"Our minds are here, and there, below, above;"
12999,THE FOURTH PART.,Nothing that's mortal can so swiftly move.
13000,THE FOURTH PART.,"Our thoughts to future things their flight direct,"
13001,THE FOURTH PART.,And in an instant all that's past collect.
13002,THE FOURTH PART.,"Reason, remembrance, wit, inventive art,"
13003,THE FOURTH PART.,"No nature, but immortal, can impart."
13004,THE FOURTH PART.,"Man's soul in a perpetual motion flows,"
13005,THE FOURTH PART.,And to no outward cause that motion owes;
13006,THE FOURTH PART.,"And therefore that no end can overtake,"
13007,THE FOURTH PART.,Because our minds cannot themselves forsake.                         850
13008,THE FOURTH PART.,And since the matter of our soul is pure
13009,THE FOURTH PART.,"And simple, which no mixture can endure"
13010,THE FOURTH PART.,"Of parts, which not among themselves agree;"
13011,THE FOURTH PART.,Therefore it never can divided be.
13012,THE FOURTH PART.,And Nature shows (without philosophy)
13013,THE FOURTH PART.,"What cannot be divided, cannot die."
13014,THE FOURTH PART.,We even in early infancy discern
13015,THE FOURTH PART.,Knowledge is born with babes before they learn;
13016,THE FOURTH PART.,Ere they can speak they find so many ways
13017,THE FOURTH PART.,"To serve their turn, and see more arts than days:                    860"
13018,THE FOURTH PART.,"Before their thoughts they plainly can express,"
13019,THE FOURTH PART.,The words and things they know are numberless;
13020,THE FOURTH PART.,"Which Nature only and no art could find,"
13021,THE FOURTH PART.,"But what she taught before, she call'd to mind,"
13022,THE FOURTH PART.,These to his sons (as Xenophon records)
13023,THE FOURTH PART.,Of the great Cyrus were the dying words;
13024,THE FOURTH PART.,'Fear not when I depart (nor therefore mourn)
13025,THE FOURTH PART.,"I shall be nowhere, or to nothing turn:"
13026,THE FOURTH PART.,"That soul which gave me life, was seen by none,"
13027,THE FOURTH PART.,Yet by the actions it design'd was known;                            870
13028,THE FOURTH PART.,"And though its flight no mortal eye shall see,"
13029,THE FOURTH PART.,"Yet know, for ever it the same shall be."
13030,THE FOURTH PART.,That soul which can immortal glory give
13031,THE FOURTH PART.,To her own virtues must for ever live.
13032,THE FOURTH PART.,Can you believe that man's all-knowing mind
13033,THE FOURTH PART.,Can to a mortal body be confined?
13034,THE FOURTH PART.,Though a foul foolish prison her immure
13035,THE FOURTH PART.,"On earth, she (when escaped) is wise and pure."
13036,THE FOURTH PART.,Man's body when dissolved is but the same                            879
13037,THE FOURTH PART.,"With beasts, and must return from whence it came;"
13038,THE FOURTH PART.,"But whence into our bodies reason flows,"
13039,THE FOURTH PART.,"None sees it when it comes, or where it goes."
13040,THE FOURTH PART.,"Nothing resembles death so much as sleep,"
13041,THE FOURTH PART.,Yet then our minds themselves from slumber keep.
13042,THE FOURTH PART.,"When from their fleshly bondage they are free,"
13043,THE FOURTH PART.,Then what divine and future things they see!
13044,THE FOURTH PART.,"Which makes it most apparent whence they are,"
13045,THE FOURTH PART.,"And what they shall hereafter be, declare.'"
13046,THE FOURTH PART.,This noble speech the dying Cyrus made.
13047,THE FOURTH PART.,"Me (Scipio) shall no argument persuade,                              890"
13048,THE FOURTH PART.,"Thy grandsire, and his brother, to whom Fame"
13049,THE FOURTH PART.,"Gave, from two conquer'd parts o' th'world, their name,"
13050,THE FOURTH PART.,"Nor thy great grandsire, nor thy father Paul,"
13051,THE FOURTH PART.,Who fell at Cannæ against Hannibal;
13052,THE FOURTH PART.,Nor I (for 'tis permitted to the aged
13053,THE FOURTH PART.,To boast their actions) had so oft engaged
13054,THE FOURTH PART.,"In battles, and in pleadings, had we thought,"
13055,THE FOURTH PART.,That only fame our virtuous actions bought;
13056,THE FOURTH PART.,'Twere better in soft pleasure and repose
13057,THE FOURTH PART.,Ingloriously our peaceful eyes to close:                             900
13058,THE FOURTH PART.,"Some high assurance hath possess'd my mind,"
13059,THE FOURTH PART.,After my death an happier life to find.
13060,THE FOURTH PART.,"Unless our souls from the immortals came,"
13061,THE FOURTH PART.,What end have we to seek immortal fame?
13062,THE FOURTH PART.,"All virtuous spirits some such hope attends,"
13063,THE FOURTH PART.,Therefore the wise his days with pleasure ends.
13064,THE FOURTH PART.,"The foolish and short-sighted die with fear,"
13065,THE FOURTH PART.,"That they go nowhere, or they know not where."
13066,THE FOURTH PART.,"The wise and virtuous soul, with clearer eyes,"
13067,THE FOURTH PART.,"Before she parts, some happy port descries.                          910"
13068,THE FOURTH PART.,"My friends, your fathers I shall surely see:"
13069,THE FOURTH PART.,"Nor only those I loved, or who loved me,"
13070,THE FOURTH PART.,"But such as before ours did end their days,"
13071,THE FOURTH PART.,"Of whom we hear, and read, and write their praise."
13072,THE FOURTH PART.,"This I believe; for were I on my way,"
13073,THE FOURTH PART.,"None should persuade me to return, or stay:"
13074,THE FOURTH PART.,Should some god tell me that I should be born
13075,THE FOURTH PART.,"And cry again, his offer I would scorn;"
13076,THE FOURTH PART.,"Asham'd, when I have ended well my race,"
13077,THE FOURTH PART.,To be led back to my first starting-place.                           920
13078,THE FOURTH PART.,"And since with life we are more grieved than joy'd,"
13079,THE FOURTH PART.,We should be either satisfied or cloy'd:
13080,THE FOURTH PART.,"Yet will I not my length of days deplore,"
13081,THE FOURTH PART.,As many wise and learn'd have done before:
13082,THE FOURTH PART.,"Nor can I think such life in vain is lent,"
13083,THE FOURTH PART.,Which for our country and our friends is spent.
13084,THE FOURTH PART.,"Hence from an inn, not from my home, I pass,"
13085,THE FOURTH PART.,Since Nature meant us here no dwelling-place.
13086,THE FOURTH PART.,"Happy when I, from this turmoil set free,"
13087,THE FOURTH PART.,That peaceful and divine assembly see:                               930
13088,THE FOURTH PART.,"Not only those I named I there shall greet,"
13089,THE FOURTH PART.,But my own gallant virtuous Cato meet.
13090,THE FOURTH PART.,"Nor did I weep, when I to ashes turn'd"
13091,THE FOURTH PART.,"His belov'd body, who should mine have burn'd."
13092,THE FOURTH PART.,"I in my thoughts beheld his soul ascend,"
13093,THE FOURTH PART.,Where his fixed hopes our interview attend:
13094,THE FOURTH PART.,Then cease to wonder that I feel no grief
13095,THE FOURTH PART.,"From age, which is of my delights the chief."
13096,THE FOURTH PART.,My hopes if this assurance hath deceived
13097,THE FOURTH PART.,"(That I man's soul immortal have believed),                          940"
13098,THE FOURTH PART.,"And if I err, no power shall dispossess"
13099,THE FOURTH PART.,"My thoughts of that expected happiness,"
13100,THE FOURTH PART.,"Though some minute philosophers pretend,"
13101,THE FOURTH PART.,That with our days our pains and pleasures end.
13102,THE FOURTH PART.,"If it be so, I hold the safer side,"
13103,THE FOURTH PART.,For none of them my error shall deride.
13104,THE FOURTH PART.,"And if hereafter no rewards appear,                                  947"
13105,THE FOURTH PART.,Yet virtue hath itself rewarded here.
13106,THE FOURTH PART.,"If those who this opinion have despised,"
13107,THE FOURTH PART.,"And their whole life to pleasure sacrificed,"
13108,THE FOURTH PART.,"Should feel their error, they, when undeceived,"
13109,THE FOURTH PART.,Too late will wish that me they had believed.
13110,THE FOURTH PART.,"If souls no immortality obtain,"
13111,THE FOURTH PART.,'Tis fit our bodies should be out of pain.
13112,THE FOURTH PART.,The same uneasiness which everything
13113,THE FOURTH PART.,"Gives to our nature, life must also bring."
13114,THE FOURTH PART.,"Good acts, if long, seem tedious; so is age,"
13115,THE FOURTH PART.,Acting too long upon this earth her stage.--
13116,THE FOURTH PART.,"Thus much for age, to which when you arrive,"
13117,THE FOURTH PART.,"That joy to you, which it gives me, 'twill give.                     960"
