36,THE ARGUMENT.,
37,THE ARGUMENT.,
38,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lucius Tarquinius (for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus), after he"
39,THE ARGUMENT.,"had caused his own father-in-law, Servius Tullius, to be cruelly"
40,THE ARGUMENT.,"murdered, and, contrary to the Roman laws and customs, not requiring or"
41,THE ARGUMENT.,"staying for the people’s suffrages, had possessed himself of the"
42,THE ARGUMENT.,"kingdom, went, accompanied with his sons and other noblemen of Rome, to"
43,THE ARGUMENT.,besiege Ardea. During which siege the principal men of the army meeting
44,THE ARGUMENT.,"one evening at the tent of Sextus Tarquinius, the king’s son, in their"
45,THE ARGUMENT.,"discourses after supper, everyone commended the virtues of his own"
46,THE ARGUMENT.,wife; among whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his
47,THE ARGUMENT.,wife Lucretia. In that pleasant humour they all posted to Rome; and
48,THE ARGUMENT.,"intending, by their secret and sudden arrival, to make trial of that"
49,THE ARGUMENT.,"which everyone had before avouched, only Collatinus finds his wife,"
50,THE ARGUMENT.,"though it were late in the night, spinning amongst her maids: the other"
51,THE ARGUMENT.,"ladies were all found dancing and revelling, or in several disports."
52,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus the victory, and his wife the"
53,THE ARGUMENT.,fame. At that time Sextus Tarquinius being inflamed with Lucrece’s
54,THE ARGUMENT.,"beauty, yet smothering his passions for the present, departed with the"
55,THE ARGUMENT.,rest back to the camp; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew
56,THE ARGUMENT.,"himself, and was (according to his estate) royally entertained and"
57,THE ARGUMENT.,lodged by Lucrece at Collatium. The same night he treacherously
58,THE ARGUMENT.,"stealeth into her chamber, violently ravished her, and early in the"
59,THE ARGUMENT.,"morning speedeth away. Lucrece, in this lamentable plight, hastily"
60,THE ARGUMENT.,"dispatched messengers, one to Rome for her father, another to the camp"
61,THE ARGUMENT.,"for Collatine. They came, the one accompanied with Junius Brutus, the"
62,THE ARGUMENT.,other with Publius Valerius; and finding Lucrece attired in mourning
63,THE ARGUMENT.,"habit, demanded the cause of her sorrow. She, first taking an oath of"
64,THE ARGUMENT.,"them for her revenge, revealed the actor, and whole manner of his"
65,THE ARGUMENT.,"dealing, and withal suddenly stabbed herself. Which done, with one"
66,THE ARGUMENT.,consent they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the
67,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tarquins; and bearing the dead body to Rome, Brutus acquainted the"
68,THE ARGUMENT.,"people with the doer and manner of the vile deed, with a bitter"
69,THE ARGUMENT.,invective against the tyranny of the king; wherewith the people were so
70,THE ARGUMENT.,"moved, that with one consent and a general acclamation the Tarquins"
71,THE ARGUMENT.,"were all exiled, and the state government changed from kings to"
72,THE ARGUMENT.,consuls.
73,THE ARGUMENT.,
74,THE ARGUMENT.,
75,THE ARGUMENT.,
76,THE ARGUMENT.,
77,THE ARGUMENT.,"From the besieged Ardea all in post,"
78,THE ARGUMENT.,"Borne by the trustless wings of false desire,"
79,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,"
80,THE ARGUMENT.,"And to Collatium bears the lightless fire,"
81,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire"
82,THE ARGUMENT.,And girdle with embracing flames the waist
83,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Collatine’s fair love, Lucrece the chaste."
84,THE ARGUMENT.,
85,THE ARGUMENT.,Haply that name of “chaste” unhapp’ly set
86,THE ARGUMENT.,"This bateless edge on his keen appetite,"
87,THE ARGUMENT.,When Collatine unwisely did not let
88,THE ARGUMENT.,To praise the clear unmatched red and white
89,THE ARGUMENT.,Which triumphed in that sky of his delight;
90,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where mortal stars as bright as heaven’s beauties,"
91,THE ARGUMENT.,With pure aspects did him peculiar duties.
92,THE ARGUMENT.,
93,THE ARGUMENT.,"For he the night before, in Tarquin’s tent"
94,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unlocked the treasure of his happy state,"
95,THE ARGUMENT.,What priceless wealth the heavens had him lent
96,THE ARGUMENT.,In the possession of his beauteous mate;
97,THE ARGUMENT.,Reck’ning his fortune at such high proud rate
98,THE ARGUMENT.,"That kings might be espoused to more fame,"
99,THE ARGUMENT.,But king nor peer to such a peerless dame.
100,THE ARGUMENT.,
101,THE ARGUMENT.,"O happiness enjoyed but of a few,"
102,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, if possessed, as soon decayed and done"
103,THE ARGUMENT.,As is the morning’s silver melting dew
104,THE ARGUMENT.,Against the golden splendour of the sun!
105,THE ARGUMENT.,"An expired date, cancelled ere well begun."
106,THE ARGUMENT.,"Honour and beauty in the owner’s arms,"
107,THE ARGUMENT.,Are weakly fortressed from a world of harms.
108,THE ARGUMENT.,
109,THE ARGUMENT.,Beauty itself doth of itself persuade
110,THE ARGUMENT.,The eyes of men without an orator;
111,THE ARGUMENT.,"What needeth then apologies be made,"
112,THE ARGUMENT.,To set forth that which is so singular?
113,THE ARGUMENT.,Or why is Collatine the publisher
114,THE ARGUMENT.,Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown
115,THE ARGUMENT.,"From thievish ears, because it is his own?"
116,THE ARGUMENT.,
117,THE ARGUMENT.,Perchance his boast of Lucrece’ sov’reignty
118,THE ARGUMENT.,Suggested this proud issue of a king;
119,THE ARGUMENT.,For by our ears our hearts oft tainted be.
120,THE ARGUMENT.,"Perchance that envy of so rich a thing,"
121,THE ARGUMENT.,"Braving compare, disdainfully did sting"
122,THE ARGUMENT.,"His high-pitched thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt"
123,THE ARGUMENT.,That golden hap which their superiors want.
124,THE ARGUMENT.,
125,THE ARGUMENT.,But some untimely thought did instigate
126,THE ARGUMENT.,"His all-too-timeless speed, if none of those;"
127,THE ARGUMENT.,"His honour, his affairs, his friends, his state,"
128,THE ARGUMENT.,"Neglected all, with swift intent he goes"
129,THE ARGUMENT.,To quench the coal which in his liver glows.
130,THE ARGUMENT.,"O rash false heat, wrapped in repentant cold,"
131,THE ARGUMENT.,Thy hasty spring still blasts and ne’er grows old!
132,THE ARGUMENT.,
133,THE ARGUMENT.,"When at Collatium this false lord arrived,"
134,THE ARGUMENT.,"Well was he welcomed by the Roman dame,"
135,THE ARGUMENT.,Within whose face beauty and virtue strived
136,THE ARGUMENT.,Which of them both should underprop her fame.
137,THE ARGUMENT.,"When virtue bragged, beauty would blush for shame;"
138,THE ARGUMENT.,"When beauty boasted blushes, in despite"
139,THE ARGUMENT.,Virtue would stain that o’er with silver white.
140,THE ARGUMENT.,
141,THE ARGUMENT.,"But beauty, in that white intituled"
142,THE ARGUMENT.,"From Venus’ doves, doth challenge that fair field."
143,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then virtue claims from beauty beauty’s red,"
144,THE ARGUMENT.,Which virtue gave the golden age to gild
145,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their silver cheeks, and called it then their shield;"
146,THE ARGUMENT.,"Teaching them thus to use it in the fight,"
147,THE ARGUMENT.,"When shame assailed, the red should fence the white."
148,THE ARGUMENT.,
149,THE ARGUMENT.,"This heraldry in Lucrece’ face was seen,"
150,THE ARGUMENT.,Argued by beauty’s red and virtue’s white.
151,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of either’s colour was the other queen,"
152,THE ARGUMENT.,Proving from world’s minority their right.
153,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet their ambition makes them still to fight;
154,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sovereignty of either being so great,"
155,THE ARGUMENT.,That oft they interchange each other’s seat.
156,THE ARGUMENT.,
157,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their silent war of lilies and of roses,"
158,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which Tarquin viewed in her fair face’s field,"
159,THE ARGUMENT.,In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses;
160,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where, lest between them both it should be killed,"
161,THE ARGUMENT.,The coward captive vanquished doth yield
162,THE ARGUMENT.,To those two armies that would let him go
163,THE ARGUMENT.,Rather than triumph in so false a foe.
164,THE ARGUMENT.,
165,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now thinks he that her husband’s shallow tongue,"
166,THE ARGUMENT.,"The niggard prodigal that praised her so,"
167,THE ARGUMENT.,"In that high task hath done her beauty wrong,"
168,THE ARGUMENT.,Which far exceeds his barren skill to show.
169,THE ARGUMENT.,Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe
170,THE ARGUMENT.,"Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,"
171,THE ARGUMENT.,In silent wonder of still-gazing eyes.
172,THE ARGUMENT.,
173,THE ARGUMENT.,"This earthly saint, adored by this devil,"
174,THE ARGUMENT.,Little suspecteth the false worshipper;
175,THE ARGUMENT.,For unstained thoughts do seldom dream on evil;
176,THE ARGUMENT.,Birds never limed no secret bushes fear.
177,THE ARGUMENT.,So guiltless she securely gives good cheer
178,THE ARGUMENT.,"And reverend welcome to her princely guest,"
179,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose inward ill no outward harm expressed.
180,THE ARGUMENT.,
181,THE ARGUMENT.,"For that he coloured with his high estate,"
182,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hiding base sin in pleats of majesty,"
183,THE ARGUMENT.,"That nothing in him seemed inordinate,"
184,THE ARGUMENT.,"Save sometime too much wonder of his eye,"
185,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which, having all, all could not satisfy;"
186,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, poorly rich, so wanteth in his store"
187,THE ARGUMENT.,"That, cloyed with much, he pineth still for more."
188,THE ARGUMENT.,
189,THE ARGUMENT.,"But she, that never coped with stranger eyes,"
190,THE ARGUMENT.,"Could pick no meaning from their parling looks,"
191,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor read the subtle shining secrecies
192,THE ARGUMENT.,Writ in the glassy margents of such books;
193,THE ARGUMENT.,"She touched no unknown baits, nor feared no hooks,"
194,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor could she moralize his wanton sight,"
195,THE ARGUMENT.,More than his eyes were opened to the light.
196,THE ARGUMENT.,
197,THE ARGUMENT.,"He stories to her ears her husband’s fame,"
198,THE ARGUMENT.,Won in the fields of fruitful Italy;
199,THE ARGUMENT.,"And decks with praises Collatine’s high name,"
200,THE ARGUMENT.,Made glorious by his manly chivalry
201,THE ARGUMENT.,With bruised arms and wreaths of victory.
202,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her joy with heaved-up hand she doth express,"
203,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, wordless, so greets heaven for his success."
204,THE ARGUMENT.,
205,THE ARGUMENT.,"Far from the purpose of his coming thither,"
206,THE ARGUMENT.,He makes excuses for his being there.
207,THE ARGUMENT.,No cloudy show of stormy blust’ring weather
208,THE ARGUMENT.,"Doth yet in his fair welkin once appear,"
209,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till sable Night, mother of dread and fear,"
210,THE ARGUMENT.,"Upon the world dim darkness doth display,"
211,THE ARGUMENT.,And in her vaulty prison stows the day.
212,THE ARGUMENT.,
213,THE ARGUMENT.,"For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed,"
214,THE ARGUMENT.,Intending weariness with heavy sprite;
215,THE ARGUMENT.,For after supper long he questioned
216,THE ARGUMENT.,"With modest Lucrece, and wore out the night."
217,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now leaden slumber with life’s strength doth fight,"
218,THE ARGUMENT.,"And every one to rest themselves betake,"
219,THE ARGUMENT.,Save thieves and cares and troubled minds that wake.
220,THE ARGUMENT.,
221,THE ARGUMENT.,As one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving
222,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sundry dangers of his will’s obtaining,"
223,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet ever to obtain his will resolving,"
224,THE ARGUMENT.,Though weak-built hopes persuade him to abstaining.
225,THE ARGUMENT.,"Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining,"
226,THE ARGUMENT.,"And when great treasure is the meed proposed,"
227,THE ARGUMENT.,"Though death be adjunct, there’s no death supposed."
228,THE ARGUMENT.,
229,THE ARGUMENT.,Those that much covet are with gain so fond
230,THE ARGUMENT.,"For what they have not, that which they possess"
231,THE ARGUMENT.,They scatter and unloose it from their bond;
232,THE ARGUMENT.,"And so, by hoping more, they have but less,"
233,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, gaining more, the profit of excess"
234,THE ARGUMENT.,"Is but to surfeit, and such griefs sustain,"
235,THE ARGUMENT.,That they prove bankrout in this poor-rich gain.
236,THE ARGUMENT.,
237,THE ARGUMENT.,The aim of all is but to nurse the life
238,THE ARGUMENT.,"With honour, wealth, and ease, in waning age;"
239,THE ARGUMENT.,And in this aim there is such thwarting strife
240,THE ARGUMENT.,That one for all or all for one we gage:
241,THE ARGUMENT.,"As life for honour in fell battle’s rage,"
242,THE ARGUMENT.,Honour for wealth; and oft that wealth doth cost
243,THE ARGUMENT.,"The death of all, and all together lost."
244,THE ARGUMENT.,
245,THE ARGUMENT.,So that in vent’ring ill we leave to be
246,THE ARGUMENT.,"The things we are, for that which we expect;"
247,THE ARGUMENT.,"And this ambitious foul infirmity,"
248,THE ARGUMENT.,"In having much, torments us with defect"
249,THE ARGUMENT.,Of that we have. So then we do neglect
250,THE ARGUMENT.,"The thing we have, and, all for want of wit,"
251,THE ARGUMENT.,Make something nothing by augmenting it.
252,THE ARGUMENT.,
253,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make,"
254,THE ARGUMENT.,Pawning his honour to obtain his lust;
255,THE ARGUMENT.,And for himself himself he must forsake.
256,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then where is truth, if there be no self-trust?"
257,THE ARGUMENT.,"When shall he think to find a stranger just,"
258,THE ARGUMENT.,"When he himself himself confounds, betrays"
259,THE ARGUMENT.,To sland’rous tongues and wretched hateful days?
260,THE ARGUMENT.,
261,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now stole upon the time the dead of night,"
262,THE ARGUMENT.,When heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes.
263,THE ARGUMENT.,"No comfortable star did lend his light,"
264,THE ARGUMENT.,No noise but owls’ and wolves’ death-boding cries;
265,THE ARGUMENT.,Now serves the season that they may surprise
266,THE ARGUMENT.,"The silly lambs. Pure thoughts are dead and still,"
267,THE ARGUMENT.,While lust and murder wake to stain and kill.
268,THE ARGUMENT.,
269,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now this lustful lord leaped from his bed,"
270,THE ARGUMENT.,Throwing his mantle rudely o’er his arm;
271,THE ARGUMENT.,Is madly tossed between desire and dread;
272,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ one sweetly flatters, th’ other feareth harm."
273,THE ARGUMENT.,"But honest fear, bewitched with lust’s foul charm,"
274,THE ARGUMENT.,"Doth too too oft betake him to retire,"
275,THE ARGUMENT.,Beaten away by brain-sick rude desire.
276,THE ARGUMENT.,
277,THE ARGUMENT.,"His falchion on a flint he softly smiteth,"
278,THE ARGUMENT.,That from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly;
279,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth,"
280,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which must be lodestar to his lustful eye,"
281,THE ARGUMENT.,And to the flame thus speaks advisedly:
282,THE ARGUMENT.,"“As from this cold flint I enforced this fire,"
283,THE ARGUMENT.,So Lucrece must I force to my desire.”
284,THE ARGUMENT.,
285,THE ARGUMENT.,Here pale with fear he doth premeditate
286,THE ARGUMENT.,"The dangers of his loathsome enterprise,"
287,THE ARGUMENT.,And in his inward mind he doth debate
288,THE ARGUMENT.,What following sorrow may on this arise.
289,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then looking scornfully, he doth despise"
290,THE ARGUMENT.,"His naked armour of still-slaughtered lust,"
291,THE ARGUMENT.,And justly thus controls his thoughts unjust:
292,THE ARGUMENT.,
293,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Fair torch, burn out thy light, and lend it not"
294,THE ARGUMENT.,To darken her whose light excelleth thine.
295,THE ARGUMENT.,"And die, unhallowed thoughts, before you blot"
296,THE ARGUMENT.,With your uncleanness that which is divine.
297,THE ARGUMENT.,Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine.
298,THE ARGUMENT.,Let fair humanity abhor the deed
299,THE ARGUMENT.,That spots and stains love’s modest snow-white weed.
300,THE ARGUMENT.,
301,THE ARGUMENT.,“O shame to knighthood and to shining arms!
302,THE ARGUMENT.,O foul dishonour to my household’s grave!
303,THE ARGUMENT.,O impious act including all foul harms!
304,THE ARGUMENT.,A martial man to be soft fancy’s slave!
305,THE ARGUMENT.,True valour still a true respect should have.
306,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then my digression is so vile, so base,"
307,THE ARGUMENT.,That it will live engraven in my face.
308,THE ARGUMENT.,
309,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Yea, though I die, the scandal will survive"
310,THE ARGUMENT.,And be an eye-sore in my golden coat;
311,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some loathsome dash the herald will contrive,"
312,THE ARGUMENT.,"To cipher me how fondly I did dote,"
313,THE ARGUMENT.,"That my posterity, shamed with the note,"
314,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall curse my bones, and hold it for no sin"
315,THE ARGUMENT.,To wish that I their father had not been.
316,THE ARGUMENT.,
317,THE ARGUMENT.,“What win I if I gain the thing I seek?
318,THE ARGUMENT.,"A dream, a breath, a froth of fleeting joy."
319,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who buys a minute’s mirth to wail a week,"
320,THE ARGUMENT.,Or sells eternity to get a toy?
321,THE ARGUMENT.,For one sweet grape who will the vine destroy?
322,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,"
323,THE ARGUMENT.,Would with the sceptre straight be strucken down?
324,THE ARGUMENT.,
325,THE ARGUMENT.,"“If Collatinus dream of my intent,"
326,THE ARGUMENT.,"Will he not wake, and in a desp’rate rage"
327,THE ARGUMENT.,"Post hither, this vile purpose to prevent?—"
328,THE ARGUMENT.,"This siege that hath engirt his marriage,"
329,THE ARGUMENT.,"This blur to youth, this sorrow to the sage,"
330,THE ARGUMENT.,"This dying virtue, this surviving shame,"
331,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose crime will bear an ever-during blame?
332,THE ARGUMENT.,
333,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O, what excuse can my invention make"
334,THE ARGUMENT.,When thou shalt charge me with so black a deed?
335,THE ARGUMENT.,"Will not my tongue be mute, my frail joints shake,"
336,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mine eyes forgo their light, my false heart bleed?"
337,THE ARGUMENT.,"The guilt being great, the fear doth still exceed;"
338,THE ARGUMENT.,"And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly,"
339,THE ARGUMENT.,But coward-like with trembling terror die.
340,THE ARGUMENT.,
341,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Had Collatinus killed my son or sire,"
342,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or lain in ambush to betray my life,"
343,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or were he not my dear friend, this desire"
344,THE ARGUMENT.,"Might have excuse to work upon his wife,"
345,THE ARGUMENT.,As in revenge or quittal of such strife;
346,THE ARGUMENT.,"But as he is my kinsman, my dear friend,"
347,THE ARGUMENT.,The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end.
348,THE ARGUMENT.,
349,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Shameful it is; ay, if the fact be known."
350,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hateful it is, there is no hate in loving."
351,THE ARGUMENT.,I’ll beg her love. But she is not her own.
352,THE ARGUMENT.,The worst is but denial and reproving.
353,THE ARGUMENT.,"My will is strong, past reason’s weak removing."
354,THE ARGUMENT.,Who fears a sentence or an old man’s saw
355,THE ARGUMENT.,Shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe.”
356,THE ARGUMENT.,
357,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, graceless, holds he disputation"
358,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tween frozen conscience and hot-burning will,"
359,THE ARGUMENT.,"And with good thoughts makes dispensation,"
360,THE ARGUMENT.,Urging the worser sense for vantage still;
361,THE ARGUMENT.,Which in a moment doth confound and kill
362,THE ARGUMENT.,"All pure effects, and doth so far proceed"
363,THE ARGUMENT.,That what is vile shows like a virtuous deed.
364,THE ARGUMENT.,
365,THE ARGUMENT.,"Quoth he, “She took me kindly by the hand,"
366,THE ARGUMENT.,"And gazed for tidings in my eager eyes,"
367,THE ARGUMENT.,Fearing some hard news from the warlike band
368,THE ARGUMENT.,Where her beloved Collatinus lies.
369,THE ARGUMENT.,O how her fear did make her colour rise!
370,THE ARGUMENT.,"First red as roses that on lawn we lay,"
371,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then white as lawn, the roses took away."
372,THE ARGUMENT.,
373,THE ARGUMENT.,"“And how her hand, in my hand being locked,"
374,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forced it to tremble with her loyal fear,"
375,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which struck her sad, and then it faster rocked,"
376,THE ARGUMENT.,Until her husband’s welfare she did hear;
377,THE ARGUMENT.,Whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer
378,THE ARGUMENT.,"That had Narcissus seen her as she stood,"
379,THE ARGUMENT.,Self-love had never drowned him in the flood.
380,THE ARGUMENT.,
381,THE ARGUMENT.,“Why hunt I then for colour or excuses?
382,THE ARGUMENT.,All orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth.
383,THE ARGUMENT.,Poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses;
384,THE ARGUMENT.,Love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth.
385,THE ARGUMENT.,"Affection is my captain, and he leadeth;"
386,THE ARGUMENT.,"And when his gaudy banner is displayed,"
387,THE ARGUMENT.,The coward fights and will not be dismayed.
388,THE ARGUMENT.,
389,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Then, childish fear, avaunt! Debating, die!"
390,THE ARGUMENT.,Respect and reason wait on wrinkled age!
391,THE ARGUMENT.,My heart shall never countermand mine eye.
392,THE ARGUMENT.,Sad pause and deep regard beseems the sage;
393,THE ARGUMENT.,"My part is youth, and beats these from the stage."
394,THE ARGUMENT.,"Desire my pilot is, beauty my prize;"
395,THE ARGUMENT.,Then who fears sinking where such treasure lies?”
396,THE ARGUMENT.,
397,THE ARGUMENT.,"As corn o’ergrown by weeds, so heedful fear"
398,THE ARGUMENT.,Is almost choked by unresisted lust.
399,THE ARGUMENT.,"Away he steals with opening, list’ning ear,"
400,THE ARGUMENT.,"Full of foul hope, and full of fond mistrust;"
401,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both which, as servitors to the unjust,"
402,THE ARGUMENT.,So cross him with their opposite persuasion
403,THE ARGUMENT.,"That now he vows a league, and now invasion."
404,THE ARGUMENT.,
405,THE ARGUMENT.,"Within his thought her heavenly image sits,"
406,THE ARGUMENT.,And in the self-same seat sits Collatine.
407,THE ARGUMENT.,That eye which looks on her confounds his wits;
408,THE ARGUMENT.,"That eye which him beholds, as more divine,"
409,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unto a view so false will not incline,"
410,THE ARGUMENT.,"But with a pure appeal seeks to the heart,"
411,THE ARGUMENT.,Which once corrupted takes the worser part;
412,THE ARGUMENT.,
413,THE ARGUMENT.,"And therein heartens up his servile powers,"
414,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, flattered by their leader’s jocund show,"
415,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stuff up his lust, as minutes fill up hours;"
416,THE ARGUMENT.,"And as their captain, so their pride doth grow,"
417,THE ARGUMENT.,Paying more slavish tribute than they owe.
418,THE ARGUMENT.,"By reprobate desire thus madly led,"
419,THE ARGUMENT.,The Roman lord marcheth to Lucrece’ bed.
420,THE ARGUMENT.,
421,THE ARGUMENT.,"The locks between her chamber and his will,"
422,THE ARGUMENT.,"Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;"
423,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, as they open, they all rate his ill,"
424,THE ARGUMENT.,Which drives the creeping thief to some regard.
425,THE ARGUMENT.,The threshold grates the door to have him heard;
426,THE ARGUMENT.,Night-wand’ring weasels shriek to see him there;
427,THE ARGUMENT.,"They fright him, yet he still pursues his fear."
428,THE ARGUMENT.,
429,THE ARGUMENT.,"As each unwilling portal yields him way,"
430,THE ARGUMENT.,Through little vents and crannies of the place
431,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wind wars with his torch, to make him stay,"
432,THE ARGUMENT.,"And blows the smoke of it into his face,"
433,THE ARGUMENT.,Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
434,THE ARGUMENT.,"But his hot heart, which fond desire doth scorch,"
435,THE ARGUMENT.,Puffs forth another wind that fires the torch.
436,THE ARGUMENT.,
437,THE ARGUMENT.,"And being lighted, by the light he spies"
438,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lucretia’s glove, wherein her needle sticks;"
439,THE ARGUMENT.,"He takes it from the rushes where it lies,"
440,THE ARGUMENT.,"And griping it, the needle his finger pricks,"
441,THE ARGUMENT.,"As who should say, “This glove to wanton tricks"
442,THE ARGUMENT.,Is not inured. Return again in haste;
443,THE ARGUMENT.,Thou seest our mistress’ ornaments are chaste.”
444,THE ARGUMENT.,
445,THE ARGUMENT.,But all these poor forbiddings could not stay him;
446,THE ARGUMENT.,He in the worst sense construes their denial.
447,THE ARGUMENT.,"The doors, the wind, the glove that did delay him,"
448,THE ARGUMENT.,He takes for accidental things of trial;
449,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or as those bars which stop the hourly dial,"
450,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who with a ling’ring stay his course doth let,"
451,THE ARGUMENT.,Till every minute pays the hour his debt.
452,THE ARGUMENT.,
453,THE ARGUMENT.,"“So, so,” quoth he, “these lets attend the time,"
454,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring,"
455,THE ARGUMENT.,"To add a more rejoicing to the prime,"
456,THE ARGUMENT.,And give the sneaped birds more cause to sing.
457,THE ARGUMENT.,Pain pays the income of each precious thing:
458,THE ARGUMENT.,"Huge rocks, high winds, strong pirates, shelves and sands"
459,THE ARGUMENT.,"The merchant fears, ere rich at home he lands.”"
460,THE ARGUMENT.,
461,THE ARGUMENT.,Now is he come unto the chamber door
462,THE ARGUMENT.,"That shuts him from the heaven of his thought,"
463,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which with a yielding latch, and with no more,"
464,THE ARGUMENT.,Hath barred him from the blessed thing he sought.
465,THE ARGUMENT.,"So from himself impiety hath wrought,"
466,THE ARGUMENT.,"That for his prey to pray he doth begin,"
467,THE ARGUMENT.,As if the heavens should countenance his sin.
468,THE ARGUMENT.,
469,THE ARGUMENT.,"But in the midst of his unfruitful prayer,"
470,THE ARGUMENT.,Having solicited th’ eternal power
471,THE ARGUMENT.,"That his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair,"
472,THE ARGUMENT.,"And they would stand auspicious to the hour,"
473,THE ARGUMENT.,"Even there he starts. Quoth he, “I must deflower."
474,THE ARGUMENT.,"The powers to whom I pray abhor this fact,"
475,THE ARGUMENT.,How can they then assist me in the act?
476,THE ARGUMENT.,
477,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Then Love and Fortune be my gods, my guide!"
478,THE ARGUMENT.,My will is backed with resolution.
479,THE ARGUMENT.,Thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried;
480,THE ARGUMENT.,The blackest sin is cleared with absolution.
481,THE ARGUMENT.,Against love’s fire fear’s frost hath dissolution.
482,THE ARGUMENT.,"The eye of heaven is out, and misty night"
483,THE ARGUMENT.,Covers the shame that follows sweet delight.”
484,THE ARGUMENT.,
485,THE ARGUMENT.,"This said, his guilty hand plucked up the latch,"
486,THE ARGUMENT.,And with his knee the door he opens wide.
487,THE ARGUMENT.,The dove sleeps fast that this night-owl will catch;
488,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus treason works ere traitors be espied.
489,THE ARGUMENT.,Who sees the lurking serpent steps aside;
490,THE ARGUMENT.,"But she, sound sleeping, fearing no such thing,"
491,THE ARGUMENT.,Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting.
492,THE ARGUMENT.,
493,THE ARGUMENT.,"Into the chamber wickedly he stalks,"
494,THE ARGUMENT.,And gazeth on her yet unstained bed.
495,THE ARGUMENT.,"The curtains being close, about he walks,"
496,THE ARGUMENT.,Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head.
497,THE ARGUMENT.,"By their high treason is his heart misled,"
498,THE ARGUMENT.,Which gives the watch-word to his hand full soon
499,THE ARGUMENT.,To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon.
500,THE ARGUMENT.,
501,THE ARGUMENT.,"Look as the fair and fiery-pointed sun,"
502,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rushing from forth a cloud, bereaves our sight;"
503,THE ARGUMENT.,"Even so, the curtain drawn, his eyes begun"
504,THE ARGUMENT.,"To wink, being blinded with a greater light."
505,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whether it is that she reflects so bright,"
506,THE ARGUMENT.,"That dazzleth them, or else some shame supposed;"
507,THE ARGUMENT.,"But blind they are, and keep themselves enclosed."
508,THE ARGUMENT.,
509,THE ARGUMENT.,"O, had they in that darksome prison died,"
510,THE ARGUMENT.,Then had they seen the period of their ill!
511,THE ARGUMENT.,Then Collatine again by Lucrece’ side
512,THE ARGUMENT.,In his clear bed might have reposed still.
513,THE ARGUMENT.,"But they must ope, this blessed league to kill;"
514,THE ARGUMENT.,And holy-thoughted Lucrece to their sight
515,THE ARGUMENT.,"Must sell her joy, her life, her world’s delight."
516,THE ARGUMENT.,
517,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under,"
518,THE ARGUMENT.,Coz’ning the pillow of a lawful kiss;
519,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,"
520,THE ARGUMENT.,Swelling on either side to want his bliss;
521,THE ARGUMENT.,"Between whose hills her head entombed is,"
522,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where like a virtuous monument she lies,"
523,THE ARGUMENT.,To be admired of lewd unhallowed eyes.
524,THE ARGUMENT.,
525,THE ARGUMENT.,"Without the bed her other fair hand was,"
526,THE ARGUMENT.,On the green coverlet; whose perfect white
527,THE ARGUMENT.,"Showed like an April daisy on the grass,"
528,THE ARGUMENT.,With pearly sweat resembling dew of night.
529,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,"
530,THE ARGUMENT.,"And canopied in darkness sweetly lay,"
531,THE ARGUMENT.,Till they might open to adorn the day.
532,THE ARGUMENT.,
533,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her hair, like golden threads, played with her breath:"
534,THE ARGUMENT.,"O modest wantons, wanton modesty!"
535,THE ARGUMENT.,"Showing life’s triumph in the map of death,"
536,THE ARGUMENT.,And death’s dim look in life’s mortality.
537,THE ARGUMENT.,"Each in her sleep themselves so beautify,"
538,THE ARGUMENT.,"As if between them twain there were no strife,"
539,THE ARGUMENT.,But that life lived in death and death in life.
540,THE ARGUMENT.,
541,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue,"
542,THE ARGUMENT.,"A pair of maiden worlds unconquered,"
543,THE ARGUMENT.,"Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,"
544,THE ARGUMENT.,And him by oath they truly honoured.
545,THE ARGUMENT.,These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred;
546,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, like a foul usurper, went about"
547,THE ARGUMENT.,From this fair throne to heave the owner out.
548,THE ARGUMENT.,
549,THE ARGUMENT.,What could he see but mightily he noted?
550,THE ARGUMENT.,What did he note but strongly he desired?
551,THE ARGUMENT.,"What he beheld, on that he firmly doted,"
552,THE ARGUMENT.,And in his will his wilful eye he tired.
553,THE ARGUMENT.,With more than admiration he admired
554,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her azure veins, her alabaster skin,"
555,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin."
556,THE ARGUMENT.,
557,THE ARGUMENT.,"As the grim lion fawneth o’er his prey,"
558,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,"
559,THE ARGUMENT.,"So o’er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,"
560,THE ARGUMENT.,His rage of lust by grazing qualified—
561,THE ARGUMENT.,"Slaked, not suppressed; for standing by her side,"
562,THE ARGUMENT.,"His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,"
563,THE ARGUMENT.,Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins.
564,THE ARGUMENT.,
565,THE ARGUMENT.,"And they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,"
566,THE ARGUMENT.,"Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting,"
567,THE ARGUMENT.,"In bloody death and ravishment delighting,"
568,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor children’s tears nor mothers’ groans respecting,"
569,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swell in their pride, the onset still expecting."
570,THE ARGUMENT.,"Anon his beating heart, alarum striking,"
571,THE ARGUMENT.,Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking.
572,THE ARGUMENT.,
573,THE ARGUMENT.,"His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,"
574,THE ARGUMENT.,His eye commends the leading to his hand;
575,THE ARGUMENT.,"His hand, as proud of such a dignity,"
576,THE ARGUMENT.,"Smoking with pride, marched on to make his stand"
577,THE ARGUMENT.,"On her bare breast, the heart of all her land;"
578,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,"
579,THE ARGUMENT.,Left their round turrets destitute and pale.
580,THE ARGUMENT.,
581,THE ARGUMENT.,"They, must’ring to the quiet cabinet"
582,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where their dear governess and lady lies,"
583,THE ARGUMENT.,"Do tell her she is dreadfully beset,"
584,THE ARGUMENT.,And fright her with confusion of their cries.
585,THE ARGUMENT.,"She, much amazed, breaks ope her locked-up eyes,"
586,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,"
587,THE ARGUMENT.,Are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled.
588,THE ARGUMENT.,
589,THE ARGUMENT.,Imagine her as one in dead of night
590,THE ARGUMENT.,"From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,"
591,THE ARGUMENT.,"That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite,"
592,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose grim aspect sets every joint a shaking.
593,THE ARGUMENT.,"What terror ’tis! but she, in worser taking,"
594,THE ARGUMENT.,"From sleep disturbed, heedfully doth view"
595,THE ARGUMENT.,The sight which makes supposed terror true.
596,THE ARGUMENT.,
597,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wrapped and confounded in a thousand fears,"
598,THE ARGUMENT.,Like to a new-killed bird she trembling lies.
599,THE ARGUMENT.,"She dares not look; yet, winking, there appears"
600,THE ARGUMENT.,"Quick-shifting antics, ugly in her eyes."
601,THE ARGUMENT.,Such shadows are the weak brain’s forgeries;
602,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,"
603,THE ARGUMENT.,In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights.
604,THE ARGUMENT.,
605,THE ARGUMENT.,"His hand, that yet remains upon her breast,"
606,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!"
607,THE ARGUMENT.,"May feel her heart, poor citizen, distressed,"
608,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,"
609,THE ARGUMENT.,"Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal."
610,THE ARGUMENT.,"This moves in him more rage, and lesser pity,"
611,THE ARGUMENT.,To make the breach and enter this sweet city.
612,THE ARGUMENT.,
613,THE ARGUMENT.,"First, like a trumpet doth his tongue begin"
614,THE ARGUMENT.,"To sound a parley to his heartless foe,"
615,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who o’er the white sheet peers her whiter chin,"
616,THE ARGUMENT.,"The reason of this rash alarm to know,"
617,THE ARGUMENT.,Which he by dumb demeanour seeks to show;
618,THE ARGUMENT.,But she with vehement prayers urgeth still
619,THE ARGUMENT.,Under what colour he commits this ill.
620,THE ARGUMENT.,
621,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus he replies: “The colour in thy face,"
622,THE ARGUMENT.,"That even for anger makes the lily pale,"
623,THE ARGUMENT.,"And the red rose blush at her own disgrace,"
624,THE ARGUMENT.,Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale.
625,THE ARGUMENT.,Under that colour am I come to scale
626,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy never-conquered fort; the fault is thine,"
627,THE ARGUMENT.,For those thine eyes betray thee unto mine.
628,THE ARGUMENT.,
629,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Thus I forestall thee, if thou mean to chide:"
630,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night,"
631,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where thou with patience must my will abide,"
632,THE ARGUMENT.,"My will that marks thee for my earth’s delight,"
633,THE ARGUMENT.,Which I to conquer sought with all my might.
634,THE ARGUMENT.,"But as reproof and reason beat it dead,"
635,THE ARGUMENT.,By thy bright beauty was it newly bred.
636,THE ARGUMENT.,
637,THE ARGUMENT.,“I see what crosses my attempt will bring;
638,THE ARGUMENT.,I know what thorns the growing rose defends;
639,THE ARGUMENT.,I think the honey guarded with a sting;
640,THE ARGUMENT.,All this beforehand counsel comprehends.
641,THE ARGUMENT.,"But will is deaf, and hears no heedful friends;"
642,THE ARGUMENT.,"Only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty,"
643,THE ARGUMENT.,"And dotes on what he looks, ’gainst law or duty."
644,THE ARGUMENT.,
645,THE ARGUMENT.,"“I have debated, even in my soul,"
646,THE ARGUMENT.,"What wrong, what shame, what sorrow I shall breed;"
647,THE ARGUMENT.,"But nothing can affection’s course control,"
648,THE ARGUMENT.,Or stop the headlong fury of his speed.
649,THE ARGUMENT.,"I know repentant tears ensue the deed,"
650,THE ARGUMENT.,"Reproach, disdain, and deadly enmity;"
651,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet strike I to embrace mine infamy.”
652,THE ARGUMENT.,
653,THE ARGUMENT.,"This said, he shakes aloft his Roman blade,"
654,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which, like a falcon tow’ring in the skies,"
655,THE ARGUMENT.,"Coucheth the fowl below with his wings’ shade,"
656,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose crooked beak threats, if he mount he dies."
657,THE ARGUMENT.,So under his insulting falchion lies
658,THE ARGUMENT.,"Harmless Lucretia, marking what he tells"
659,THE ARGUMENT.,"With trembling fear, as fowl hear falcon’s bells."
660,THE ARGUMENT.,
661,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Lucrece,” quoth he, “this night I must enjoy thee."
662,THE ARGUMENT.,"If thou deny, then force must work my way,"
663,THE ARGUMENT.,For in thy bed I purpose to destroy thee;
664,THE ARGUMENT.,"That done, some worthless slave of thine I’ll slay."
665,THE ARGUMENT.,To kill thine honour with thy life’s decay;
666,THE ARGUMENT.,"And in thy dead arms do I mean to place him,"
667,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swearing I slew him, seeing thee embrace him."
668,THE ARGUMENT.,
669,THE ARGUMENT.,“So thy surviving husband shall remain
670,THE ARGUMENT.,The scornful mark of every open eye;
671,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain,"
672,THE ARGUMENT.,Thy issue blurred with nameless bastardy.
673,THE ARGUMENT.,"And thou, the author of their obloquy,"
674,THE ARGUMENT.,Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes
675,THE ARGUMENT.,And sung by children in succeeding times.
676,THE ARGUMENT.,
677,THE ARGUMENT.,"“But if thou yield, I rest thy secret friend."
678,THE ARGUMENT.,The fault unknown is as a thought unacted;
679,THE ARGUMENT.,A little harm done to a great good end
680,THE ARGUMENT.,For lawful policy remains enacted.
681,THE ARGUMENT.,The poisonous simple sometimes is compacted
682,THE ARGUMENT.,"In a pure compound; being so applied,"
683,THE ARGUMENT.,His venom in effect is purified.
684,THE ARGUMENT.,
685,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Then, for thy husband and thy children’s sake,"
686,THE ARGUMENT.,Tender my suit. Bequeath not to their lot
687,THE ARGUMENT.,"The shame that from them no device can take,"
688,THE ARGUMENT.,"The blemish that will never be forgot,"
689,THE ARGUMENT.,"Worse than a slavish wipe, or birth-hour’s blot:"
690,THE ARGUMENT.,For marks descried in men’s nativity
691,THE ARGUMENT.,"Are nature’s faults, not their own infamy.”"
692,THE ARGUMENT.,
693,THE ARGUMENT.,Here with a cockatrice’ dead-killing eye
694,THE ARGUMENT.,He rouseth up himself and makes a pause;
695,THE ARGUMENT.,"While she, the picture of pure piety,"
696,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like a white hind under the gripe’s sharp claws,"
697,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pleads in a wilderness where are no laws,"
698,THE ARGUMENT.,"To the rough beast that knows no gentle right,"
699,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor aught obeys but his foul appetite.
700,THE ARGUMENT.,
701,THE ARGUMENT.,"But when a black-faced cloud the world doth threat,"
702,THE ARGUMENT.,"In his dim mist th’ aspiring mountains hiding,"
703,THE ARGUMENT.,"From earth’s dark womb some gentle gust doth get,"
704,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which blows these pitchy vapours from their biding,"
705,THE ARGUMENT.,Hind’ring their present fall by this dividing;
706,THE ARGUMENT.,"So his unhallowed haste her words delays,"
707,THE ARGUMENT.,And moody Pluto winks while Orpheus plays.
708,THE ARGUMENT.,
709,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, foul night-waking cat, he doth but dally,"
710,THE ARGUMENT.,While in his hold-fast foot the weak mouse panteth.
711,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her sad behaviour feeds his vulture folly,"
712,THE ARGUMENT.,A swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth.
713,THE ARGUMENT.,"His ear her prayers admits, but his heart granteth"
714,THE ARGUMENT.,No penetrable entrance to her plaining;
715,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tears harden lust, though marble wear with raining."
716,THE ARGUMENT.,
717,THE ARGUMENT.,Her pity-pleading eyes are sadly fixed
718,THE ARGUMENT.,In the remorseless wrinkles of his face.
719,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her modest eloquence with sighs is mixed,"
720,THE ARGUMENT.,Which to her oratory adds more grace.
721,THE ARGUMENT.,"She puts the period often from his place,"
722,THE ARGUMENT.,And midst the sentence so her accent breaks
723,THE ARGUMENT.,That twice she doth begin ere once she speaks.
724,THE ARGUMENT.,
725,THE ARGUMENT.,"She conjures him by high almighty Jove,"
726,THE ARGUMENT.,"By knighthood, gentry, and sweet friendship’s oath,"
727,THE ARGUMENT.,"By her untimely tears, her husband’s love,"
728,THE ARGUMENT.,"By holy human law, and common troth,"
729,THE ARGUMENT.,"By heaven and earth, and all the power of both,"
730,THE ARGUMENT.,"That to his borrowed bed he make retire,"
731,THE ARGUMENT.,"And stoop to honour, not to foul desire."
732,THE ARGUMENT.,
733,THE ARGUMENT.,"Quoth she, “Reward not hospitality"
734,THE ARGUMENT.,With such black payment as thou hast pretended;

761,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou art not what thou seem’st; and if the same,"
762,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou seem’st not what thou art, a god, a king;"
763,THE ARGUMENT.,For kings like gods should govern everything.

771,THE ARGUMENT.,Then kings’ misdeeds cannot be hid in clay.
772,THE ARGUMENT.,
773,THE ARGUMENT.,"“This deed will make thee only loved for fear,"
774,THE ARGUMENT.,But happy monarchs still are feared for love.

776,THE ARGUMENT.,When they in thee the like offences prove.
777,THE ARGUMENT.,"If but for fear of this, thy will remove,"
778,THE ARGUMENT.,"For princes are the glass, the school, the book,"
779,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where subjects’ eyes do learn, do read, do look."
780,THE ARGUMENT.,
781,THE ARGUMENT.,“And wilt thou be the school where Lust shall learn?

1277,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O that is gone for which I sought to live,"
1278,THE ARGUMENT.,And therefore now I need not fear to die.
1279,THE ARGUMENT.,"To clear this spot by death, at least I give"
1280,THE ARGUMENT.,"A badge of fame to slander’s livery,"
1281,THE ARGUMENT.,A dying life to living infamy.
1282,THE ARGUMENT.,"Poor helpless help, the treasure stol’n away,"
1283,THE ARGUMENT.,To burn the guiltless casket where it lay!
1284,THE ARGUMENT.,
1285,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Well, well, dear Collatine, thou shalt not know"
1286,THE ARGUMENT.,The stained taste of violated troth;
1287,THE ARGUMENT.,"I will not wrong thy true affection so,"
1288,THE ARGUMENT.,To flatter thee with an infringed oath.
1289,THE ARGUMENT.,This bastard graff shall never come to growth;
1290,THE ARGUMENT.,He shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
1291,THE ARGUMENT.,That thou art doting father of his fruit.
1292,THE ARGUMENT.,
1293,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought,"
1294,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor laugh with his companions at thy state;
1295,THE ARGUMENT.,But thou shalt know thy int’rest was not bought
1296,THE ARGUMENT.,"Basely with gold, but stol’n from forth thy gate."
1297,THE ARGUMENT.,"For me, I am the mistress of my fate,"
1298,THE ARGUMENT.,"And with my trespass never will dispense,"
1299,THE ARGUMENT.,Till life to death acquit my forced offence.
1300,THE ARGUMENT.,
1301,THE ARGUMENT.,"“I will not poison thee with my attaint,"
1302,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor fold my fault in cleanly-coined excuses;
1303,THE ARGUMENT.,"My sable ground of sin I will not paint,"
1304,THE ARGUMENT.,To hide the truth of this false night’s abuses.
1305,THE ARGUMENT.,"My tongue shall utter all; mine eyes, like sluices,"
1306,THE ARGUMENT.,"As from a mountain-spring that feeds a dale,"
1307,THE ARGUMENT.,Shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale.”
1308,THE ARGUMENT.,
1309,THE ARGUMENT.,"By this, lamenting Philomel had ended"
1310,THE ARGUMENT.,"The well-tuned warble of her nightly sorrow,"
1311,THE ARGUMENT.,And solemn night with slow sad gait descended
1312,THE ARGUMENT.,"To ugly hell; when, lo, the blushing morrow"
1313,THE ARGUMENT.,Lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow.
1314,THE ARGUMENT.,"But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see,"
1315,THE ARGUMENT.,And therefore still in night would cloistered be.
1316,THE ARGUMENT.,
1317,THE ARGUMENT.,"Revealing day through every cranny spies,"
1318,THE ARGUMENT.,"And seems to point her out where she sits weeping,"
1319,THE ARGUMENT.,"To whom she sobbing speaks: “O eye of eyes,"
1320,THE ARGUMENT.,"Why pry’st thou through my window? Leave thy peeping,"
1321,THE ARGUMENT.,Mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping.
1322,THE ARGUMENT.,"Brand not my forehead with thy piercing light,"
1323,THE ARGUMENT.,For day hath naught to do what’s done by night.”
1324,THE ARGUMENT.,
1325,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus cavils she with everything she sees.
1326,THE ARGUMENT.,"True grief is fond and testy as a child,"
1327,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who wayward once, his mood with naught agrees."
1328,THE ARGUMENT.,"Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild."
1329,THE ARGUMENT.,"Continuance tames the one; the other wild,"
1330,THE ARGUMENT.,Like an unpractised swimmer plunging still
1331,THE ARGUMENT.,With too much labour drowns for want of skill.
1332,THE ARGUMENT.,
1333,THE ARGUMENT.,"So she, deep-drenched in a sea of care,"
1334,THE ARGUMENT.,"Holds disputation with each thing she views,"
1335,THE ARGUMENT.,And to herself all sorrow doth compare;
1336,THE ARGUMENT.,"No object but her passion’s strength renews,"
1337,THE ARGUMENT.,"And as one shifts, another straight ensues."
1338,THE ARGUMENT.,Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words;
1339,THE ARGUMENT.,Sometime ’tis mad and too much talk affords.
1340,THE ARGUMENT.,
1341,THE ARGUMENT.,The little birds that tune their morning’s joy
1342,THE ARGUMENT.,Make her moans mad with their sweet melody.
1343,THE ARGUMENT.,For mirth doth search the bottom of annoy;
1344,THE ARGUMENT.,Sad souls are slain in merry company.
1345,THE ARGUMENT.,Grief best is pleased with grief’s society;
1346,THE ARGUMENT.,True sorrow then is feelingly sufficed
1347,THE ARGUMENT.,When with like semblance it is sympathized.
1348,THE ARGUMENT.,
1349,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis double death to drown in ken of shore;
1350,THE ARGUMENT.,He ten times pines that pines beholding food;
1351,THE ARGUMENT.,To see the salve doth make the wound ache more;
1352,THE ARGUMENT.,Great grief grieves most at that would do it good;
1353,THE ARGUMENT.,"Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood,"
1354,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, being stopped, the bounding banks o’erflows;"
1355,THE ARGUMENT.,Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows.
1356,THE ARGUMENT.,
1357,THE ARGUMENT.,"“You mocking birds,” quoth she, “your tunes entomb"
1358,THE ARGUMENT.,"Within your hollow-swelling feathered breasts,"
1359,THE ARGUMENT.,And in my hearing be you mute and dumb;
1360,THE ARGUMENT.,My restless discord loves no stops nor rests.
1361,THE ARGUMENT.,A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests.
1362,THE ARGUMENT.,Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;
1363,THE ARGUMENT.,Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears.
1364,THE ARGUMENT.,
1365,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Come, Philomel, that sing’st of ravishment,"
1366,THE ARGUMENT.,Make thy sad grove in my disheveled hair.
1367,THE ARGUMENT.,"As the dank earth weeps at thy languishment,"
1368,THE ARGUMENT.,So I at each sad strain will strain a tear
1369,THE ARGUMENT.,And with deep groans the diapason bear;
1370,THE ARGUMENT.,"For burden-wise I’ll hum on Tarquin still,"
1371,THE ARGUMENT.,While thou on Tereus descants better skill.
1372,THE ARGUMENT.,
1373,THE ARGUMENT.,“And whiles against a thorn thou bear’st thy part
1374,THE ARGUMENT.,"To keep thy sharp woes waking, wretched I,"
1375,THE ARGUMENT.,"To imitate thee well, against my heart"
1376,THE ARGUMENT.,"Will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye,"
1377,THE ARGUMENT.,Who if it wink shall thereon fall and die.
1378,THE ARGUMENT.,"These means, as frets upon an instrument,"
1379,THE ARGUMENT.,Shall tune our heart-strings to true languishment.
1380,THE ARGUMENT.,
1381,THE ARGUMENT.,"“And for, poor bird, thou sing’st not in the day,"
1382,THE ARGUMENT.,"As shaming any eye should thee behold,"
1383,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some dark deep desert seated from the way,"
1384,THE ARGUMENT.,"That knows not parching heat nor freezing cold,"
1385,THE ARGUMENT.,Will we find out; and there we will unfold
1386,THE ARGUMENT.,To creatures stern sad tunes to change their kinds.
1387,THE ARGUMENT.,"Since men prove beasts, let beasts bear gentle minds.”"
1388,THE ARGUMENT.,
1389,THE ARGUMENT.,"As the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze,"
1390,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wildly determining which way to fly,"
1391,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or one encompassed with a winding maze,"
1392,THE ARGUMENT.,That cannot tread the way out readily;
1393,THE ARGUMENT.,"So with herself is she in mutiny,"
1394,THE ARGUMENT.,"To live or die which of the twain were better,"
1395,THE ARGUMENT.,When life is shamed and Death reproach’s debtor.
1396,THE ARGUMENT.,
1397,THE ARGUMENT.,"“To kill myself,” quoth she, “alack, what were it,"
1398,THE ARGUMENT.,But with my body my poor soul’s pollution?
1399,THE ARGUMENT.,They that lose half with greater patience bear it
1400,THE ARGUMENT.,Than they whose whole is swallowed in confusion.
1401,THE ARGUMENT.,That mother tries a merciless conclusion
1402,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, having two sweet babes, when death takes one,"
1403,THE ARGUMENT.,"Will slay the other, and be nurse to none."
1404,THE ARGUMENT.,
1405,THE ARGUMENT.,"“My body or my soul, which was the dearer,"
1406,THE ARGUMENT.,"When the one pure, the other made divine?"
1407,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose love of either to myself was nearer,"
1408,THE ARGUMENT.,When both were kept for heaven and Collatine?
1409,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ay me, the bark pilled from the lofty pine,"
1410,THE ARGUMENT.,His leaves will wither and his sap decay;
1411,THE ARGUMENT.,"So must my soul, her bark being pilled away."
1412,THE ARGUMENT.,
1413,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Her house is sacked, her quiet interrupted,"
1414,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her mansion battered by the enemy,"
1415,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her sacred temple spotted, spoiled, corrupted,"
1416,THE ARGUMENT.,Grossly engirt with daring infamy.
1417,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then let it not be called impiety,"
1418,THE ARGUMENT.,If in this blemished fort I make some hole
1419,THE ARGUMENT.,Through which I may convey this troubled soul.
1420,THE ARGUMENT.,
1421,THE ARGUMENT.,“Yet die I will not till my Collatine
1422,THE ARGUMENT.,"Have heard the cause of my untimely death,"
1423,THE ARGUMENT.,"That he may vow, in that sad hour of mine,"
1424,THE ARGUMENT.,Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
1425,THE ARGUMENT.,"My stained blood to Tarquin I’ll bequeath,"
1426,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which by him tainted shall for him be spent,"
1427,THE ARGUMENT.,And as his due writ in my testament.
1428,THE ARGUMENT.,
1429,THE ARGUMENT.,“My honour I’ll bequeath unto the knife
1430,THE ARGUMENT.,That wounds my body so dishonoured.
1431,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis honour to deprive dishonoured life;
1432,THE ARGUMENT.,"The one will live, the other being dead."
1433,THE ARGUMENT.,"So of shame’s ashes shall my fame be bred,"
1434,THE ARGUMENT.,For in my death I murder shameful scorn;
1435,THE ARGUMENT.,"My shame so dead, mine honour is new born."
1436,THE ARGUMENT.,
1437,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Dear lord of that dear jewel I have lost,"
1438,THE ARGUMENT.,What legacy shall I bequeath to thee?
1439,THE ARGUMENT.,"My resolution, love, shall be thy boast,"
1440,THE ARGUMENT.,By whose example thou revenged mayst be.
1441,THE ARGUMENT.,"How Tarquin must be used, read it in me;"
1442,THE ARGUMENT.,"Myself, thy friend, will kill myself, thy foe,"
1443,THE ARGUMENT.,And for my sake serve thou false Tarquin so.
1444,THE ARGUMENT.,
1445,THE ARGUMENT.,“This brief abridgement of my will I make:
1446,THE ARGUMENT.,My soul and body to the skies and ground;
1447,THE ARGUMENT.,"My resolution, husband, do thou take;"
1448,THE ARGUMENT.,Mine honour be the knife’s that makes my wound;
1449,THE ARGUMENT.,My shame be his that did my fame confound;
1450,THE ARGUMENT.,And all my fame that lives disbursed be
1451,THE ARGUMENT.,To those that live and think no shame of me.
1452,THE ARGUMENT.,
1453,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Thou, Collatine, shalt oversee this will;"
1454,THE ARGUMENT.,How was I overseen that thou shalt see it!
1455,THE ARGUMENT.,My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill;
1456,THE ARGUMENT.,My life’s foul deed my life’s fair end shall free it.
1457,THE ARGUMENT.,"Faint not, faint heart, but stoutly say, ‘So be it.’"
1458,THE ARGUMENT.,Yield to my hand; my hand shall conquer thee.
1459,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou dead, both die, and both shall victors be.”"
1460,THE ARGUMENT.,
1461,THE ARGUMENT.,"This plot of death when sadly she had laid,"
1462,THE ARGUMENT.,"And wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes,"
1463,THE ARGUMENT.,"With untuned tongue she hoarsely called her maid,"
1464,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose swift obedience to her mistress hies;
1465,THE ARGUMENT.,For fleet-winged duty with thought’s feathers flies.
1466,THE ARGUMENT.,Poor Lucrece’ cheeks unto her maid seem so
1467,THE ARGUMENT.,As winter meads when sun doth melt their snow.
1468,THE ARGUMENT.,
1469,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her mistress she doth give demure good-morrow,"
1470,THE ARGUMENT.,"With soft slow tongue, true mark of modesty,"
1471,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sorts a sad look to her lady’s sorrow,"
1472,THE ARGUMENT.,"For why her face wore sorrow’s livery,"
1473,THE ARGUMENT.,But durst not ask of her audaciously
1474,THE ARGUMENT.,"Why her two suns were cloud-eclipsed so,"
1475,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor why her fair cheeks over-washed with woe.
1476,THE ARGUMENT.,
1477,THE ARGUMENT.,"But as the earth doth weep, the sun being set,"
1478,THE ARGUMENT.,"Each flower moistened like a melting eye,"
1479,THE ARGUMENT.,Even so the maid with swelling drops ’gan wet
1480,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her circled eyne, enforced by sympathy"
1481,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of those fair suns set in her mistress’ sky,"
1482,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who in a salt-waved ocean quench their light,"
1483,THE ARGUMENT.,Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night.
1484,THE ARGUMENT.,
1485,THE ARGUMENT.,"A pretty while these pretty creatures stand,"
1486,THE ARGUMENT.,Like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling.
1487,THE ARGUMENT.,One justly weeps; the other takes in hand
1488,THE ARGUMENT.,"No cause, but company, of her drops spilling."
1489,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their gentle sex to weep are often willing,"
1490,THE ARGUMENT.,"Grieving themselves to guess at others’ smarts,"
1491,THE ARGUMENT.,And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts.
1492,THE ARGUMENT.,
1493,THE ARGUMENT.,"For men have marble, women waxen, minds,"
1494,THE ARGUMENT.,And therefore are they formed as marble will;
1495,THE ARGUMENT.,"The weak oppressed, th’ impression of strange kinds"
1496,THE ARGUMENT.,"Is formed in them by force, by fraud, or skill."
1497,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then call them not the authors of their ill,"
1498,THE ARGUMENT.,"No more than wax shall be accounted evil,"
1499,THE ARGUMENT.,Wherein is stamped the semblance of a devil.
1500,THE ARGUMENT.,
1501,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their smoothness, like a goodly champaign plain,"
1502,THE ARGUMENT.,Lays open all the little worms that creep;
1503,THE ARGUMENT.,"In men, as in a rough-grown grove, remain"
1504,THE ARGUMENT.,Cave-keeping evils that obscurely sleep.
1505,THE ARGUMENT.,Through crystal walls each little mote will peep.
1506,THE ARGUMENT.,"Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks,"
1507,THE ARGUMENT.,Poor women’s faces are their own faults’ books.
1508,THE ARGUMENT.,
1509,THE ARGUMENT.,"No man inveigh against the withered flower,"
1510,THE ARGUMENT.,But chide rough winter that the flower hath killed;
1511,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not that devoured, but that which doth devour,"
1512,THE ARGUMENT.,"Is worthy blame. O, let it not be hild"
1513,THE ARGUMENT.,"Poor women’s faults, that they are so fulfilled"
1514,THE ARGUMENT.,"With men’s abuses! Those proud lords, to blame,"
1515,THE ARGUMENT.,Make weak-made women tenants to their shame.
1516,THE ARGUMENT.,
1517,THE ARGUMENT.,"The precedent whereof in Lucrece view,"
1518,THE ARGUMENT.,Assailed by night with circumstances strong
1519,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of present death, and shame that might ensue"
1520,THE ARGUMENT.,"By that her death, to do her husband wrong."
1521,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such danger to resistance did belong,"
1522,THE ARGUMENT.,The dying fear through all her body spread;
1523,THE ARGUMENT.,And who cannot abuse a body dead?
1524,THE ARGUMENT.,
1525,THE ARGUMENT.,"By this, mild patience bid fair Lucrece speak"
1526,THE ARGUMENT.,To the poor counterfeit of her complaining:
1527,THE ARGUMENT.,"“My girl,” quoth she, “on what occasion break"
1528,THE ARGUMENT.,"Those tears from thee, that down thy cheeks are raining?"
1529,THE ARGUMENT.,"If thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining,"
1530,THE ARGUMENT.,"Know, gentle wench, it small avails my mood."
1531,THE ARGUMENT.,"If tears could help, mine own would do me good."
1532,THE ARGUMENT.,
1533,THE ARGUMENT.,"“But tell me, girl, when went”—and there she stayed"
1534,THE ARGUMENT.,Till after a deep groan—“Tarquin from hence?”
1535,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Madam, ere I was up,” replied the maid,"
1536,THE ARGUMENT.,“The more to blame my sluggard negligence.
1537,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense:
1538,THE ARGUMENT.,"Myself was stirring ere the break of day,"
1539,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, ere I rose, was Tarquin gone away."
1540,THE ARGUMENT.,
1541,THE ARGUMENT.,"“But, lady, if your maid may be so bold,"
1542,THE ARGUMENT.,She would request to know your heaviness.”
1543,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O peace!” quoth Lucrece. “If it should be told,"
1544,THE ARGUMENT.,The repetition cannot make it less;
1545,THE ARGUMENT.,"For more it is than I can well express,"
1546,THE ARGUMENT.,"And that deep torture may be called a hell,"
1547,THE ARGUMENT.,When more is felt than one hath power to tell.
1548,THE ARGUMENT.,
1549,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Go, get me hither paper, ink, and pen."
1550,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet save that labour, for I have them here."
1551,THE ARGUMENT.,What should I say?—One of my husband’s men
1552,THE ARGUMENT.,Bid thou be ready by and by to bear
1553,THE ARGUMENT.,"A letter to my lord, my love, my dear."
1554,THE ARGUMENT.,Bid him with speed prepare to carry it;
1555,THE ARGUMENT.,"The cause craves haste, and it will soon be writ.”"
1556,THE ARGUMENT.,
1557,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her maid is gone, and she prepares to write,"
1558,THE ARGUMENT.,First hovering o’er the paper with her quill.
1559,THE ARGUMENT.,Conceit and grief an eager combat fight;
1560,THE ARGUMENT.,What wit sets down is blotted straight with will;
1561,THE ARGUMENT.,"This is too curious-good, this blunt and ill."
1562,THE ARGUMENT.,"Much like a press of people at a door,"
1563,THE ARGUMENT.,"Throng her inventions, which shall go before."
1564,THE ARGUMENT.,
1565,THE ARGUMENT.,At last she thus begins: “Thou worthy lord
1566,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee,"
1567,THE ARGUMENT.,"Health to thy person! Next vouchsafe t’ afford,"
1568,THE ARGUMENT.,"If ever, love, thy Lucrece thou wilt see,"
1569,THE ARGUMENT.,Some present speed to come and visit me.
1570,THE ARGUMENT.,So I commend me from our house in grief.
1571,THE ARGUMENT.,"My woes are tedious, though my words are brief.”"
1572,THE ARGUMENT.,
1573,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here folds she up the tenor of her woe,"
1574,THE ARGUMENT.,Her certain sorrow writ uncertainly.
1575,THE ARGUMENT.,By this short schedule Collatine may know
1576,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her grief, but not her grief’s true quality;"
1577,THE ARGUMENT.,"She dares not thereof make discovery,"
1578,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,"
1579,THE ARGUMENT.,Ere she with blood had stained her stained excuse.
1580,THE ARGUMENT.,
1581,THE ARGUMENT.,"Besides, the life and feeling of her passion"
1582,THE ARGUMENT.,"She hoards, to spend when he is by to hear her;"
1583,THE ARGUMENT.,When sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion
1584,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of her disgrace, the better so to clear her"
1585,THE ARGUMENT.,From that suspicion which the world might bear her.
1586,THE ARGUMENT.,"To shun this blot, she would not blot the letter"
1587,THE ARGUMENT.,"With words, till action might become them better."
1588,THE ARGUMENT.,
1589,THE ARGUMENT.,"To see sad sights moves more than hear them told,"
1590,THE ARGUMENT.,For then the eye interprets to the ear
1591,THE ARGUMENT.,"The heavy motion that it doth behold,"
1592,THE ARGUMENT.,When every part a part of woe doth bear.
1593,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis but a part of sorrow that we hear.
1594,THE ARGUMENT.,"Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords,"
1595,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sorrow ebbs, being blown with wind of words."
1596,THE ARGUMENT.,
1597,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her letter now is sealed, and on it writ"
1598,THE ARGUMENT.,“At Ardea to my lord with more than haste.”
1599,THE ARGUMENT.,"The post attends, and she delivers it,"
1600,THE ARGUMENT.,Charging the sour-faced groom to hie as fast
1601,THE ARGUMENT.,As lagging fowls before the northern blast.
1602,THE ARGUMENT.,Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems;
1603,THE ARGUMENT.,Extremely still urgeth such extremes.
1604,THE ARGUMENT.,
1605,THE ARGUMENT.,"The homely villain curtsies to her low,"
1606,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, blushing on her with a steadfast eye,"
1607,THE ARGUMENT.,"Receives the scroll without or yea or no,"
1608,THE ARGUMENT.,And forth with bashful innocence doth hie.
1609,THE ARGUMENT.,But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie
1610,THE ARGUMENT.,"Imagine every eye beholds their blame,"
1611,THE ARGUMENT.,"For Lucrece thought he blushed to see her shame,"
1612,THE ARGUMENT.,
1613,THE ARGUMENT.,"When, silly groom! God wot, it was defect"
1614,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of spirit, life, and bold audacity."
1615,THE ARGUMENT.,Such harmless creatures have a true respect
1616,THE ARGUMENT.,"To talk in deeds, while others saucily"
1617,THE ARGUMENT.,"Promise more speed, but do it leisurely."
1618,THE ARGUMENT.,Even so this pattern of the worn-out age
1619,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pawned honest looks, but laid no words to gage."
1620,THE ARGUMENT.,
1621,THE ARGUMENT.,"His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,"
1622,THE ARGUMENT.,That two red fires in both their faces blazed;
1623,THE ARGUMENT.,"She thought he blushed, as knowing Tarquin’s lust,"
1624,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, blushing with him, wistly on him gazed."
1625,THE ARGUMENT.,Her earnest eye did make him more amazed.
1626,THE ARGUMENT.,"The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish,"
1627,THE ARGUMENT.,The more she thought he spied in her some blemish.
1628,THE ARGUMENT.,
1629,THE ARGUMENT.,"But long she thinks till he return again,"
1630,THE ARGUMENT.,And yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone.
1631,THE ARGUMENT.,"The weary time she cannot entertain,"
1632,THE ARGUMENT.,"For now ’tis stale to sigh, to weep, to groan;"
1633,THE ARGUMENT.,"So woe hath wearied woe, moan tired moan,"
1634,THE ARGUMENT.,"That she her plaints a little while doth stay,"
1635,THE ARGUMENT.,Pausing for means to mourn some newer way.
1636,THE ARGUMENT.,
1637,THE ARGUMENT.,At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece
1638,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of skilful painting, made for Priam’s Troy,"
1639,THE ARGUMENT.,"Before the which is drawn the power of Greece,"
1640,THE ARGUMENT.,"For Helen’s rape the city to destroy,"
1641,THE ARGUMENT.,Threat’ning cloud-kissing Ilion with annoy;
1642,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which the conceited painter drew so proud,"
1643,THE ARGUMENT.,"As heaven, it seemed,  to kiss the turrets bowed."
1644,THE ARGUMENT.,
1645,THE ARGUMENT.,"A thousand lamentable objects there,"
1646,THE ARGUMENT.,"In scorn of Nature, Art gave lifeless life."
1647,THE ARGUMENT.,"Many a dry drop seemed a weeping tear,"
1648,THE ARGUMENT.,Shed for the slaughtered husband by the wife.
1649,THE ARGUMENT.,"The red blood reeked to show the painter’s strife,"
1650,THE ARGUMENT.,"The dying eyes gleamed forth their ashy lights,"
1651,THE ARGUMENT.,Like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights.
1652,THE ARGUMENT.,
1653,THE ARGUMENT.,There might you see the labouring pioneer
1654,THE ARGUMENT.,Begrimed with sweat and smeared all with dust;
1655,THE ARGUMENT.,And from the towers of Troy there would appear
1656,THE ARGUMENT.,"The very eyes of men through loop-holes thrust,"
1657,THE ARGUMENT.,Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust.
1658,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such sweet observance in this work was had,"
1659,THE ARGUMENT.,That one might see those far-off eyes look sad.
1660,THE ARGUMENT.,
1661,THE ARGUMENT.,In great commanders grace and majesty
1662,THE ARGUMENT.,"You might behold, triumphing in their faces;"
1663,THE ARGUMENT.,"In youth, quick bearing and dexterity;"
1664,THE ARGUMENT.,And here and there the painter interlaces
1665,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pale cowards marching on with trembling paces,"
1666,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which heartless peasants did so well resemble,"
1667,THE ARGUMENT.,That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble.
1668,THE ARGUMENT.,
1669,THE ARGUMENT.,"In Ajax and Ulysses, O, what art"
1670,THE ARGUMENT.,Of physiognomy might one behold!
1671,THE ARGUMENT.,The face of either ciphered either’s heart;
1672,THE ARGUMENT.,Their face their manners most expressly told.
1673,THE ARGUMENT.,"In Ajax’ eyes blunt rage and rigour rolled,"
1674,THE ARGUMENT.,But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent
1675,THE ARGUMENT.,Showed deep regard and smiling government.
1676,THE ARGUMENT.,
1677,THE ARGUMENT.,"There pleading might you see grave Nestor stand,"
1678,THE ARGUMENT.,"As ’twere encouraging the Greeks to fight,"
1679,THE ARGUMENT.,Making such sober action with his hand
1680,THE ARGUMENT.,"That it beguiled attention, charmed the sight."
1681,THE ARGUMENT.,"In speech, it seemed, his beard, all silver white,"
1682,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wagged up and down, and from his lips did fly"
1683,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thin winding breath, which purled up to the sky."
1684,THE ARGUMENT.,
1685,THE ARGUMENT.,"About him were a press of gaping faces,"
1686,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which seemed to swallow up his sound advice,"
1687,THE ARGUMENT.,"All jointly list’ning, but with several graces,"
1688,THE ARGUMENT.,As if some mermaid did their ears entice;
1689,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some high, some low, the painter was so nice."
1690,THE ARGUMENT.,"The scalps of many, almost hid behind,"
1691,THE ARGUMENT.,To jump up higher seemed to mock the mind.
1692,THE ARGUMENT.,
1693,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here one man’s hand leaned on another’s head,"
1694,THE ARGUMENT.,His nose being shadowed by his neighbour’s ear;
1695,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here one being thronged bears back, all boll’n and red;"
1696,THE ARGUMENT.,Another smothered seems to pelt and swear;
1697,THE ARGUMENT.,And in their rage such signs of rage they bear
1698,THE ARGUMENT.,"As, but for loss of Nestor’s golden words,"
1699,THE ARGUMENT.,It seemed they would debate with angry swords.
1700,THE ARGUMENT.,
1701,THE ARGUMENT.,"For much imaginary work was there,"
1702,THE ARGUMENT.,"Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,"
1703,THE ARGUMENT.,That for Achilles’ image stood his spear
1704,THE ARGUMENT.,"Griped in an armed hand; himself, behind,"
1705,THE ARGUMENT.,"Was left unseen, save to the eye of mind."
1706,THE ARGUMENT.,"A hand, a foot, a face, a leg, a head,"
1707,THE ARGUMENT.,Stood for the whole to be imagined.
1708,THE ARGUMENT.,
1709,THE ARGUMENT.,"And from the walls of strong-besieged Troy,"
1710,THE ARGUMENT.,"When their brave hope, bold Hector, marched to field,"
1711,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stood many Trojan mothers, sharing joy"
1712,THE ARGUMENT.,To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield;
1713,THE ARGUMENT.,And to their hope they such odd action yield
1714,THE ARGUMENT.,"That through their light joy seemed to appear,"
1715,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like bright things stained, a kind of heavy fear."
1716,THE ARGUMENT.,
1717,THE ARGUMENT.,"And from the strand of Dardan, where they fought,"
1718,THE ARGUMENT.,"To Simois’ reedy banks the red blood ran,"
1719,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose waves to imitate the battle sought
1720,THE ARGUMENT.,"With swelling ridges, and their ranks began"
1721,THE ARGUMENT.,"To break upon the galled shore, and then"
1722,THE ARGUMENT.,"Retire again till, meeting greater ranks,"
1723,THE ARGUMENT.,"They join, and shoot their foam at Simois’ banks."
1724,THE ARGUMENT.,
1725,THE ARGUMENT.,"To this well-painted piece is Lucrece come,"
1726,THE ARGUMENT.,To find a face where all distress is stelled.
1727,THE ARGUMENT.,"Many she sees where cares have carved some,"
1728,THE ARGUMENT.,"But none where all distress and dolour dwelled,"
1729,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till she despairing Hecuba beheld,"
1730,THE ARGUMENT.,"Staring on Priam’s wounds with her old eyes,"
1731,THE ARGUMENT.,Which bleeding under Pyrrhus’ proud foot lies.
1732,THE ARGUMENT.,
1733,THE ARGUMENT.,In her the painter had anatomized
1734,THE ARGUMENT.,"Time’s ruin, beauty’s wrack, and grim care’s reign."
1735,THE ARGUMENT.,Her cheeks with chops and wrinkles were disguised;
1736,THE ARGUMENT.,Of what she was no semblance did remain.
1737,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her blue blood, changed to black in every vein,"
1738,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed,"
1739,THE ARGUMENT.,Showed life imprisoned in a body dead.
1740,THE ARGUMENT.,
1741,THE ARGUMENT.,"On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes,"
1742,THE ARGUMENT.,"And shapes her sorrow to the beldam’s woes,"
1743,THE ARGUMENT.,Who nothing wants to answer her but cries
1744,THE ARGUMENT.,And bitter words to ban her cruel foes.
1745,THE ARGUMENT.,"The painter was no god to lend her those,"
1746,THE ARGUMENT.,"And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong,"
1747,THE ARGUMENT.,"To give her so much grief, and not a tongue."
1748,THE ARGUMENT.,
1749,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Poor instrument,” quoth she, “without a sound,"
1750,THE ARGUMENT.,"I’ll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue,"
1751,THE ARGUMENT.,"And drop sweet balm in Priam’s painted wound,"
1752,THE ARGUMENT.,"And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong,"
1753,THE ARGUMENT.,"And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long,"
1754,THE ARGUMENT.,And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes
1755,THE ARGUMENT.,Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies.
1756,THE ARGUMENT.,
1757,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Show me the strumpet that began this stir,"
1758,THE ARGUMENT.,That with my nails her beauty I may tear.
1759,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy heat of lust, fond Paris, did incur"
1760,THE ARGUMENT.,This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear;
1761,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here,"
1762,THE ARGUMENT.,"And here in Troy, for trespass of thine eye,"
1763,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sire, the son, the dame, and daughter die."
1764,THE ARGUMENT.,
1765,THE ARGUMENT.,“Why should the private pleasure of some one
1766,THE ARGUMENT.,Become the public plague of many moe?
1767,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let sin, alone committed, light alone"
1768,THE ARGUMENT.,Upon his head that hath transgressed so;
1769,THE ARGUMENT.,Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe.
1770,THE ARGUMENT.,"For one’s offence why should so many fall,"
1771,THE ARGUMENT.,To plague a private sin in general?
1772,THE ARGUMENT.,
1773,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Lo, here weeps Hecuba, here Priam dies,"
1774,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here manly Hector faints, here Troilus swounds;"
1775,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies,"
1776,THE ARGUMENT.,"And friend to friend gives unadvised wounds,"
1777,THE ARGUMENT.,And one man’s lust these many lives confounds.
1778,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had doting Priam checked his son’s desire,"
1779,THE ARGUMENT.,Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire.”
1780,THE ARGUMENT.,
1781,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here feelingly she weeps Troy’s painted woes,"
1782,THE ARGUMENT.,"For sorrow, like a heavy-hanging bell,"
1783,THE ARGUMENT.,"Once set on ringing, with his own weight goes;"
1784,THE ARGUMENT.,Then little strength rings out the doleful knell.
1785,THE ARGUMENT.,"So Lucrece set a-work, sad tales doth tell"
1786,THE ARGUMENT.,To pencilled pensiveness and coloured sorrow;
1787,THE ARGUMENT.,"She lends them words, and she their looks doth borrow."
1788,THE ARGUMENT.,
1789,THE ARGUMENT.,"She throws her eyes about the painting round,"
1790,THE ARGUMENT.,And who she finds forlorn she doth lament.
1791,THE ARGUMENT.,"At last she sees a wretched image bound,"
1792,THE ARGUMENT.,That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent.
1793,THE ARGUMENT.,"His face, though full of cares, yet showed content;"
1794,THE ARGUMENT.,"Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes,"
1795,THE ARGUMENT.,"So mild, that patience seemed to scorn his woes."
1796,THE ARGUMENT.,
1797,THE ARGUMENT.,In him the painter laboured with his skill
1798,THE ARGUMENT.,To hide deceit and give the harmless show
1799,THE ARGUMENT.,"An humble gait, calm looks, eyes wailing still,"
1800,THE ARGUMENT.,"A brow unbent that seemed to welcome woe,"
1801,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cheeks neither red nor pale, but mingled so"
1802,THE ARGUMENT.,"That blushing red no guilty instance gave,"
1803,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have.
1804,THE ARGUMENT.,
1805,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, like a constant and confirmed devil,"
1806,THE ARGUMENT.,"He entertained a show so seeming just,"
1807,THE ARGUMENT.,"And therein so ensconced his secret evil,"
1808,THE ARGUMENT.,That jealousy itself could not mistrust
1809,THE ARGUMENT.,False-creeping craft and perjury should thrust
1810,THE ARGUMENT.,"Into so bright a day such black-faced storms,"
1811,THE ARGUMENT.,Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms.
1812,THE ARGUMENT.,
1813,THE ARGUMENT.,The well-skilled workman this mild image drew
1814,THE ARGUMENT.,"For perjured Sinon, whose enchanting story"
1815,THE ARGUMENT.,The credulous Old Priam after slew;
1816,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory
1817,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of rich-built Ilion, that the skies were sorry,"
1818,THE ARGUMENT.,"And little stars shot from their fixed places,"
1819,THE ARGUMENT.,When their glass fell wherein they viewed their faces.
1820,THE ARGUMENT.,
1821,THE ARGUMENT.,"This picture she advisedly perused,"
1822,THE ARGUMENT.,"And chid the painter for his wondrous skill,"
1823,THE ARGUMENT.,Saying some shape in Sinon’s was abused;
1824,THE ARGUMENT.,So fair a form lodged not a mind so ill.
1825,THE ARGUMENT.,"And still on him she gazed, and gazing still,"
1826,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied,"
1827,THE ARGUMENT.,That she concludes the picture was belied.
1828,THE ARGUMENT.,
1829,THE ARGUMENT.,"“It cannot be,” quoth she, “that so much guile”—"
1830,THE ARGUMENT.,She would have said “can lurk in such a look.”
1831,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Tarquin’s shape came in her mind the while,"
1832,THE ARGUMENT.,And from her tongue “can lurk” from “cannot” took.
1833,THE ARGUMENT.,"“It cannot be” she in that sense forsook,"
1834,THE ARGUMENT.,"And turned it thus: “It cannot be, I find,"
1835,THE ARGUMENT.,But such a face should bear a wicked mind.
1836,THE ARGUMENT.,
1837,THE ARGUMENT.,"“For even as subtle Sinon here is painted,"
1838,THE ARGUMENT.,"So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,"
1839,THE ARGUMENT.,"As if with grief or travail he had fainted,"
1840,THE ARGUMENT.,"To me came Tarquin armed too, beguiled"
1841,THE ARGUMENT.,"With outward honesty, but yet defiled"
1842,THE ARGUMENT.,"With inward vice. As Priam him did cherish,"
1843,THE ARGUMENT.,So did I Tarquin; so my Troy did perish.
1844,THE ARGUMENT.,
1845,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Look, look, how listening Priam wets his eyes,"
1846,THE ARGUMENT.,To see those borrowed tears that Sinon sheds!
1847,THE ARGUMENT.,"Priam, why art thou old and yet not wise?"
1848,THE ARGUMENT.,For every tear he falls a Trojan bleeds.
1849,THE ARGUMENT.,"His eye drops fire, no water thence proceeds;"
1850,THE ARGUMENT.,"Those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity,"
1851,THE ARGUMENT.,Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city.
1852,THE ARGUMENT.,
1853,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Such devils steal effects from lightless hell,"
1854,THE ARGUMENT.,"For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold,"
1855,THE ARGUMENT.,And in that cold hot-burning fire doth dwell.
1856,THE ARGUMENT.,"These contraries such unity do hold,"
1857,THE ARGUMENT.,Only to flatter fools and make them bold;
1858,THE ARGUMENT.,"So Priam’s trust false Sinon’s tears doth flatter,"
1859,THE ARGUMENT.,That he finds means to burn his Troy with water.”
1860,THE ARGUMENT.,
1861,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,"
1862,THE ARGUMENT.,That patience is quite beaten from her breast.
1863,THE ARGUMENT.,"She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,"
1864,THE ARGUMENT.,Comparing him to that unhappy guest
1865,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose deed hath made herself herself detest.
1866,THE ARGUMENT.,At last she smilingly with this gives o’er;
1867,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Fool, fool!” quoth she, “his wounds will not be sore.”"
1868,THE ARGUMENT.,
1869,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow,"
1870,THE ARGUMENT.,And time doth weary time with her complaining.
1871,THE ARGUMENT.,"She looks for night, and then she longs for morrow,"
1872,THE ARGUMENT.,And both she thinks too long with her remaining.
1873,THE ARGUMENT.,Short time seems long in sorrow’s sharp sustaining.
1874,THE ARGUMENT.,"Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps,"
1875,THE ARGUMENT.,And they that watch see time how slow it creeps.
1876,THE ARGUMENT.,
1877,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which all this time hath overslipped her thought,"
1878,THE ARGUMENT.,"That she with painted images hath spent,"
1879,THE ARGUMENT.,Being from the feeling of her own grief brought
1880,THE ARGUMENT.,"By deep surmise of others’ detriment,"
1881,THE ARGUMENT.,Losing her woes in shows of discontent.
1882,THE ARGUMENT.,"It easeth some, though none it ever cured,"
1883,THE ARGUMENT.,To think their dolour others have endured.
1884,THE ARGUMENT.,
1885,THE ARGUMENT.,"But now the mindful messenger, come back,"
1886,THE ARGUMENT.,Brings home his lord and other company;
1887,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black,"
1888,THE ARGUMENT.,And round about her tear-distained eye
1889,THE ARGUMENT.,"Blue circles streamed, like rainbows in the sky."
1890,THE ARGUMENT.,These water-galls in her dim element
1891,THE ARGUMENT.,Foretell new storms to those already spent.
1892,THE ARGUMENT.,
1893,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which when her sad-beholding husband saw,"
1894,THE ARGUMENT.,Amazedly in her sad face he stares.
1895,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her eyes, though sod in tears, looked red and raw,"
1896,THE ARGUMENT.,Her lively colour killed with deadly cares.
1897,THE ARGUMENT.,He hath no power to ask her how she fares;
1898,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both stood like old acquaintance in a trance,"
1899,THE ARGUMENT.,"Met far from home, wond’ring each other’s chance."
1900,THE ARGUMENT.,
1901,THE ARGUMENT.,"At last he takes her by the bloodless hand,"
1902,THE ARGUMENT.,And thus begins: “What uncouth ill event
1903,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hath thee befall’n, that thou dost trembling stand?"
1904,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?"
1905,THE ARGUMENT.,Why art thou thus attired in discontent?
1906,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unmask, dear dear, this moody heaviness,"
1907,THE ARGUMENT.,"And tell thy grief, that we may give redress.”"
1908,THE ARGUMENT.,
1909,THE ARGUMENT.,"Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire,"
1910,THE ARGUMENT.,Ere once she can discharge one word of woe.
1911,THE ARGUMENT.,"At length addressed to answer his desire,"
1912,THE ARGUMENT.,She modestly prepares to let them know
1913,THE ARGUMENT.,Her honour is ta’en prisoner by the foe;
1914,THE ARGUMENT.,While Collatine and his consorted lords
1915,THE ARGUMENT.,With sad attention long to hear her words.
1916,THE ARGUMENT.,
1917,THE ARGUMENT.,And now this pale swan in her wat’ry nest
1918,THE ARGUMENT.,Begins the sad dirge of her certain ending:
1919,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Few words,” quoth she, “shall fit the trespass best,"
1920,THE ARGUMENT.,Where no excuse can give the fault amending.
1921,THE ARGUMENT.,In me more woes than words are now depending;
1922,THE ARGUMENT.,"And my laments would be drawn out too long,"
1923,THE ARGUMENT.,To tell them all with one poor tired tongue.
1924,THE ARGUMENT.,
1925,THE ARGUMENT.,“Then be this all the task it hath to say:
1926,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dear husband, in the interest of thy bed"
1927,THE ARGUMENT.,"A stranger came, and on that pillow lay"
1928,THE ARGUMENT.,Where thou wast wont to rest thy weary head;
1929,THE ARGUMENT.,And what wrong else may be imagined
1930,THE ARGUMENT.,"By foul enforcement might be done to me,"
1931,THE ARGUMENT.,"From that, alas, thy Lucrece is not free."
1932,THE ARGUMENT.,
1933,THE ARGUMENT.,"“For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight,"
1934,THE ARGUMENT.,With shining falchion in my chamber came
1935,THE ARGUMENT.,"A creeping creature with a flaming light,"
1936,THE ARGUMENT.,"And softly cried ‘Awake, thou Roman dame,"
1937,THE ARGUMENT.,And entertain my love; else lasting shame
1938,THE ARGUMENT.,"On thee and thine this night I will inflict,"
1939,THE ARGUMENT.,If thou my love’s desire do contradict.
1940,THE ARGUMENT.,
1941,THE ARGUMENT.,"“‘For some hard-favoured groom of thine,’ quoth he,"
1942,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will,"
1943,THE ARGUMENT.,"I’ll murder straight, and then I’ll slaughter thee"
1944,THE ARGUMENT.,And swear I found you where you did fulfil
1945,THE ARGUMENT.,"The loathsome act of lust, and so did kill"
1946,THE ARGUMENT.,The lechers in their deed. This act will be
1947,THE ARGUMENT.,My fame and thy perpetual infamy.’
1948,THE ARGUMENT.,
1949,THE ARGUMENT.,"“With this, I did begin to start and cry,"
1950,THE ARGUMENT.,"And then against my heart he sets his sword,"
1951,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swearing, unless I took all patiently,"
1952,THE ARGUMENT.,I should not live to speak another word;
1953,THE ARGUMENT.,"So should my shame still rest upon record,"
1954,THE ARGUMENT.,And never be forgot in mighty Rome
1955,THE ARGUMENT.,The adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom.
1956,THE ARGUMENT.,
1957,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Mine enemy was strong, my poor self weak,"
1958,THE ARGUMENT.,And far the weaker with so strong a fear.
1959,THE ARGUMENT.,My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak;
1960,THE ARGUMENT.,No rightful plea might plead for justice there.
1961,THE ARGUMENT.,His scarlet lust came evidence to swear
1962,THE ARGUMENT.,That my poor beauty had purloined his eyes;
1963,THE ARGUMENT.,"And when the judge is robbed, the prisoner dies."
1964,THE ARGUMENT.,
1965,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O, teach me how to make mine own excuse,"
1966,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or at the least, this refuge let me find:"
1967,THE ARGUMENT.,"Though my gross blood be stained with this abuse,"
1968,THE ARGUMENT.,Immaculate and spotless is my mind;
1969,THE ARGUMENT.,That was not forced; that never was inclined
1970,THE ARGUMENT.,"To accessary yieldings, but still pure"
1971,THE ARGUMENT.,Doth in her poisoned closet yet endure.”
1972,THE ARGUMENT.,
1973,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lo, here the hopeless merchant of this loss,"
1974,THE ARGUMENT.,"With head declined and voice dammed up with woe,"
1975,THE ARGUMENT.,"With sad set eyes and wretched arms across,"
1976,THE ARGUMENT.,From lips new-waxen pale begins to blow
1977,THE ARGUMENT.,The grief away that stops his answer so.
1978,THE ARGUMENT.,"But wretched as he is, he strives in vain;"
1979,THE ARGUMENT.,What he breathes out his breath drinks up again.
1980,THE ARGUMENT.,
1981,THE ARGUMENT.,As through an arch the violent roaring tide
1982,THE ARGUMENT.,"Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste,"
1983,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride
1984,THE ARGUMENT.,"Back to the strait that forced him on so fast,"
1985,THE ARGUMENT.,"In rage sent out, recalled in rage, being past:"
1986,THE ARGUMENT.,"Even so his sighs, his sorrows make a saw,"
1987,THE ARGUMENT.,"To push grief on, and back the same grief draw."
1988,THE ARGUMENT.,
1989,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth,"
1990,THE ARGUMENT.,And his untimely frenzy thus awaketh:
1991,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Dear lord, thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth"
1992,THE ARGUMENT.,Another power; no flood by raining slaketh.
1993,THE ARGUMENT.,My woe too sensible thy passion maketh
1994,THE ARGUMENT.,More feeling-painful. Let it then suffice
1995,THE ARGUMENT.,"To drown one woe, one pair of weeping eyes."
1996,THE ARGUMENT.,
1997,THE ARGUMENT.,"“And for my sake, when I might charm thee so,"
1998,THE ARGUMENT.,"For she that was thy Lucrece, now attend me:"
1999,THE ARGUMENT.,"Be suddenly revenged on my foe,"
2000,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thine, mine, his own. Suppose thou dost defend me"
2001,THE ARGUMENT.,From what is past. The help that thou shalt lend me
2002,THE ARGUMENT.,"Comes all too late, yet let the traitor die,"
2003,THE ARGUMENT.,For sparing justice feeds iniquity.
2004,THE ARGUMENT.,
2005,THE ARGUMENT.,"“But ere I name him, you fair lords,” quoth she,"
2006,THE ARGUMENT.,"Speaking to those that came with Collatine,"
2007,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Shall plight your honourable faiths to me,"
2008,THE ARGUMENT.,With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine;
2009,THE ARGUMENT.,For ’tis a meritorious fair design
2010,THE ARGUMENT.,To chase injustice with revengeful arms.
2011,THE ARGUMENT.,"Knights, by their oaths, should right poor ladies’ harms.”"
2012,THE ARGUMENT.,
2013,THE ARGUMENT.,"At this request, with noble disposition"
2014,THE ARGUMENT.,"Each present lord began to promise aid,"
2015,THE ARGUMENT.,"As bound in knighthood to her imposition,"
2016,THE ARGUMENT.,Longing to hear the hateful foe bewrayed.
2017,THE ARGUMENT.,"But she, that yet her sad task hath not said,"
2018,THE ARGUMENT.,"The protestation stops. “O, speak,” quoth she,"
2019,THE ARGUMENT.,“How may this forced stain be wiped from me?
2020,THE ARGUMENT.,
2021,THE ARGUMENT.,"“What is the quality of my offence,"
2022,THE ARGUMENT.,Being constrained with dreadful circumstance?
2023,THE ARGUMENT.,"May my pure mind with the foul act dispense,"
2024,THE ARGUMENT.,My low-declined honour to advance?
2025,THE ARGUMENT.,May any terms acquit me from this chance?
2026,THE ARGUMENT.,"The poisoned fountain clears itself again,"
2027,THE ARGUMENT.,And why not I from this compelled stain?
2028,THE ARGUMENT.,
2029,THE ARGUMENT.,"With this, they all at once began to say,"
2030,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her body’s stain her mind untainted clears,"
2031,THE ARGUMENT.,While with a joyless smile she turns away
2032,THE ARGUMENT.,"The face, that map which deep impression bears"
2033,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears."
2034,THE ARGUMENT.,"“No, no,” quoth she, “no dame, hereafter living"
2035,THE ARGUMENT.,By my excuse shall claim excuse’s giving.”
2036,THE ARGUMENT.,
2037,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here with a sigh, as if her heart would break,"
2038,THE ARGUMENT.,"She throws forth Tarquin’s name: “He, he,” she says,"
2039,THE ARGUMENT.,But more than “he” her poor tongue could not speak;
2040,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till after many accents and delays,"
2041,THE ARGUMENT.,"Untimely breathings, sick and short assays,"
2042,THE ARGUMENT.,"She utters this: “He, he, fair lords, ’tis he,"
2043,THE ARGUMENT.,That guides this hand to give this wound to me.”
2044,THE ARGUMENT.,
2045,THE ARGUMENT.,Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
2046,THE ARGUMENT.,"A harmful knife, that thence her soul unsheathed."
2047,THE ARGUMENT.,That blow did bail it from the deep unrest
2048,THE ARGUMENT.,Of that polluted prison where it breathed.
2049,THE ARGUMENT.,Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeathed
2050,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her winged sprite, and through her wounds doth fly"
2051,THE ARGUMENT.,Life’s lasting date from cancelled destiny.
2052,THE ARGUMENT.,
2053,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stone-still, astonished with this deadly deed,"
2054,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew,"
2055,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till Lucrece’ father that beholds her bleed,"
2056,THE ARGUMENT.,"Himself on her self-slaughtered body threw,"
2057,THE ARGUMENT.,And from the purple fountain Brutus drew
2058,THE ARGUMENT.,"The murd’rous knife, and, as it left the place,"
2059,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her blood, in poor revenge, held it in chase;"
2060,THE ARGUMENT.,
2061,THE ARGUMENT.,"And bubbling from her breast, it doth divide"
2062,THE ARGUMENT.,"In two slow rivers, that the crimson blood"
2063,THE ARGUMENT.,"Circles her body in on every side,"
2064,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, like a late-sacked island, vastly stood"
2065,THE ARGUMENT.,Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood.
2066,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some of her blood still pure and red remained,"
2067,THE ARGUMENT.,"And some looked black, and that false Tarquin stained."
2068,THE ARGUMENT.,
2069,THE ARGUMENT.,About the mourning and congealed face
2070,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of that black blood a wat’ry rigol goes,"
2071,THE ARGUMENT.,Which seems to weep upon the tainted place;
2072,THE ARGUMENT.,"And ever since, as pitying Lucrece’ woes,"
2073,THE ARGUMENT.,"Corrupted blood some watery token shows,"
2074,THE ARGUMENT.,"And blood untainted still doth red abide,"
2075,THE ARGUMENT.,Blushing at that which is so putrified.
2076,THE ARGUMENT.,
2077,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Daughter, dear daughter,” old Lucretius cries,"
2078,THE ARGUMENT.,“That life was mine which thou hast here deprived.
2079,THE ARGUMENT.,"If in the child the father’s image lies,"
2080,THE ARGUMENT.,Where shall I live now Lucrece is unlived?
2081,THE ARGUMENT.,Thou wast not to this end from me derived.
2082,THE ARGUMENT.,"If children predecease progenitors,"
2083,THE ARGUMENT.,"We are their offspring, and they none of ours."
2084,THE ARGUMENT.,
2085,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Poor broken glass, I often did behold"
2086,THE ARGUMENT.,In thy sweet semblance my old age new born;

2088,THE ARGUMENT.,Shows me a bare-boned death by time outworn.
2089,THE ARGUMENT.,"O, from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn,"
2090,THE ARGUMENT.,"And shivered all the beauty of my glass,"
2091,THE ARGUMENT.,That I no more can see what once I was!
2092,THE ARGUMENT.,
2093,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O time, cease thou thy course and last no longer,"
2094,THE ARGUMENT.,If they surcease to be that should survive!

2106,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till manly shame bids him possess his breath,"
2107,THE ARGUMENT.,And live to be revenged on her death.
2108,THE ARGUMENT.,
2109,THE ARGUMENT.,The deep vexation of his inward soul
2110,THE ARGUMENT.,Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue;

2115,THE ARGUMENT.,That no man could distinguish what he said.
2116,THE ARGUMENT.,
2117,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet sometime “Tarquin” was pronounced plain,"
2118,THE ARGUMENT.,"But through his teeth, as if the name he tore."
2119,THE ARGUMENT.,"This windy tempest, till it blow up rain,"

2124,THE ARGUMENT.,
2125,THE ARGUMENT.,"The one doth call her his, the other his,"
2126,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet neither may possess the claim they lay,"
2127,THE ARGUMENT.,"The father says “She’s mine.” “O, mine she is,”"
2128,THE ARGUMENT.,Replies her husband. “Do not take away

2131,THE ARGUMENT.,And only must be wailed by Collatine.”
2132,THE ARGUMENT.,
2133,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O,” quoth Lucretius, “I did give that life"

2141,THE ARGUMENT.,"Brutus, who plucked the knife from Lucrece’ side,"
2142,THE ARGUMENT.,"Seeing such emulation in their woe,"
2143,THE ARGUMENT.,"Began to clothe his wit in state and pride,"
2144,THE ARGUMENT.,Burying in Lucrece’ wound his folly’s show.
2145,THE ARGUMENT.,He with the Romans was esteemed so

2149,THE ARGUMENT.,"But now he throws that shallow habit by,"
2150,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wherein deep policy did him disguise,"
2151,THE ARGUMENT.,"And armed his long-hid wits advisedly,"
2152,THE ARGUMENT.,To check the tears in Collatinus’ eyes.
2153,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Thou wronged lord of Rome,” quoth he, “arise!"
2154,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let my unsounded self, supposed a fool,"
2155,THE ARGUMENT.,Now set thy long-experienced wit to school.
2156,THE ARGUMENT.,
2157,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Why, Collatine, is woe the cure for woe?"
2158,THE ARGUMENT.,"Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?"
2159,THE ARGUMENT.,Is it revenge to give thyself a blow

2169,THE ARGUMENT.,"That they will suffer these abominations,—"
2170,THE ARGUMENT.,"Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced,—"
2171,THE ARGUMENT.,By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased.
2172,THE ARGUMENT.,
2173,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Now, by the Capitol that we adore,"
2174,THE ARGUMENT.,"And by this chaste blood so unjustly stained,"
2175,THE ARGUMENT.,"By heaven’s fair sun that breeds the fat earth’s store,"
