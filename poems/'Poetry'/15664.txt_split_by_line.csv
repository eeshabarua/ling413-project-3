56,PREFACE,
57,PREFACE,
58,PREFACE,"Here, my little man, you may hold my cap and bells,--and you, over"
59,PREFACE,"there, may hold the bauble! Now, then, I am ready to talk as a wise man"
60,PREFACE,should and am a giddy-pated jester no longer!
61,PREFACE,
62,PREFACE,This is what I have to say:
63,PREFACE,
64,PREFACE,"One must have a little pinch of seasoning in this dull, heavy life of"
65,PREFACE,"ours; one should never look to have all the troubles, the labors, and"
66,PREFACE,"the cares, with never a whit of innocent jollity and mirth. Yes, one"
67,PREFACE,"must smile now and then, if for nothing else than to lift the corners of"
68,PREFACE,the lips in laughter that are only too often dragged down in sorrow.
69,PREFACE,
70,PREFACE,"It is for this that I sit here now, telling you all manner of odd quips"
71,PREFACE,"and jests until yon sober, wise man shakes his head and goes his way,"
72,PREFACE,thinking that I am even more of a shallow-witted knave than I really am.
73,PREFACE,"But, prut! Who cares for that? I am sure that I do not if you do not."
74,PREFACE,
75,PREFACE,Yet listen! One must not look to have nothing but pepper and salt in
76,PREFACE,"this life of ours--no, indeed! At that rate we would be worse off than"
77,PREFACE,we are now. I only mean that it is a good and pleasant thing to have
78,PREFACE,something to lend the more solid part a little savor now and then!
79,PREFACE,
80,PREFACE,"So, here I'll sit; and, perhaps, when you have been good children, and"
81,PREFACE,"have learned your lessons or done your work, your mother will let you"
82,PREFACE,come and play a little while with me. I will always be ready and waiting
83,PREFACE,"for you here, and I will warrant your mother that I will do you no harm"
84,PREFACE,with anything that I may tell you. If I can only make you laugh and be
85,PREFACE,"merry for a little while, then my work will be well done, and I will be"
86,PREFACE,glad in the doing of it.
87,PREFACE,
88,PREFACE,"And now give me my cap and bells again, for my wits are growing cold"
89,PREFACE,"without them; and you will be pleased to reach me my bauble once more,"
90,PREFACE,for I love to have him by me.
91,PREFACE,
92,PREFACE,"Will you be seated? And you, over there, seat the baby on the grass! Are"
93,PREFACE,"you ready? Very well; then I will tell you a story, and it shall be"
94,PREFACE,"about ""The Skillful Huntsman."""

346,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
347,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"Oh yes, he was that."
348,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
349,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""So good,"" said the Herr Mayor. ""Then tell Jacob that when he is such a"
350,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,clever huntsman as to be able to shoot the whiskers off from a running
351,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"hare without touching the skin, then he can have Gretchen."""
352,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
353,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,[Illustration: JACOB'S MOTHER & THE HERR MAYOR]
354,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
355,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"Then Jacob's mother went back home again. ""Now,"" said she, ""Jacob will,"
356,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"at least, be satisfied."""
357,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
358,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""Yes,"" said Jacob, when she had told him all that the Herr Mayor had"
359,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"said to her, ""that is a hard thing to do; but what one man has done,"
360,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"another man can."" So he shouldered his gun, and started away into the"
361,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,world to learn to be as clever a huntsman as the Herr Mayor had said.
362,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
363,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,He plodded on and on until at last he fell in with a tall stranger
364,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,dressed all in red.
365,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
366,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""Where are you going, Jacob?"" said the tall stranger, calling him by his"
367,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"name, just as if he had eaten pottage out of the same dish with him."
368,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
369,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""I am going,"" said Jacob, ""to learn to be so clever a huntsman that I"
370,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,can shoot the whiskers off from a running hare without touching the
371,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"skin."""
372,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
373,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""That is a hard thing to learn,"" said the tall stranger."
374,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
375,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,Yes; Jacob knew that it was a hard thing; but what one man had done
376,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,another man could do.
377,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
378,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""What will you give me if I teach you to be as clever a huntsman as"
379,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"that?"" said the tall stranger."
380,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
381,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""What will you take to teach me?"" said Jacob; for he saw that the"
382,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"stranger had a horse's hoof instead of a foot, and he did not like his"
383,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"looks, I can tell you."
384,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
385,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""Oh, it is nothing much that I want,"" said the tall man; ""only just sign"
386,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"your name to this paper--that is all."""
387,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
388,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,But what was in the paper? Yes; Jacob had to know what was in the paper
389,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,before he would set so much as a finger to it.
390,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
391,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"Oh, there was nothing in the paper, only this: that when the red one"
392,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"should come for Jacob at the end of ten years' time, Jacob should"
393,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,promise to go along with him whithersoever he should take him.
394,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
395,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"At this Jacob hemmed and hawed and scratched his head, for he did not"
396,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"know about that. ""All the same,"" said he, ""I will sign the paper, but on"
397,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"one condition."""
398,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
399,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,[Illustration: Jacob and The Red One]
400,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
401,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,At this the red one screwed up his face as though he had sour beer in
402,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"his mouth, for he did not like the sound of the word ""condition."""
403,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""Well,"" said he, ""what is the condition?"""
404,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
405,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""It is only this,"" said Jacob: ""that you shall be _my_ servant for the"
406,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"ten years, and if, in all that time, I should chance to ask you a"
407,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"question that you cannot answer, then I am to be my own man again."""
408,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
409,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"Oh, if that was all, the red man was quite willing for that."
410,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
411,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"Then he took Jacob's gun, and blew down into the barrel of it. ""Now,"""
412,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"said he, ""you are as skillful a huntsman as you asked to be."""
413,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
414,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""That I must try,"" said Jacob. So Jacob and the red one went around"
415,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"hunting here and hunting there until they scared up a hare. ""Shoot!"""
416,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,said the red one; and Jacob shot. Clip! off flew the whiskers of the
417,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,hare as neatly as one could cut them off with the barber's shears.
418,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
419,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""Yes, good!"" said Jacob, ""now I am a skillful huntsman."""
420,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
421,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"Then the stranger in red gave Jacob a little bone whistle, and told him"
422,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,to blow in it whenever he should want him. After that Jacob signed the
423,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"paper, and the stranger went one way and he went home again."
424,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
425,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"Well, Jacob brushed the straws off from his coat, and put a fine shine"
426,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"on his boots, and then he set off to the Herr Mayor's house."
427,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
428,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""How do you find yourself, Jacob?"" said the Herr Mayor."
429,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
430,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""So good,"" said Jacob."
431,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
432,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""And are you a skillful huntsman now?"" said the Herr Mayor."
433,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
434,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"Oh yes, Jacob was a skillful huntsman now."
435,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
436,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"Yes, good! But the Herr Mayor must have proof of that. Now, could Jacob"
437,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,shoot a feather out of the tail of the magpie flying over the trees
438,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,yonder?
439,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
440,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,Oh yes! nothing easier than that. So Jacob raised the gun to his cheek.
441,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"Bang! went the gun, and down fell a feather from the tail of the magpie."
442,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"At this the Herr Mayor stared and stared, for he had never seen such"
443,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,shooting.
444,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
445,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""And now may I marry Gretchen?"" said Jacob."
446,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
447,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,[Illustration: Jacob shoots at the Magpie]
448,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
449,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"At this the Herr Mayor scratched his head, and hemmed and hawed. No;"
450,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"Jacob could not marry Gretchen yet, for he had always said and sworn"
451,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,that the man who should marry Gretchen should bring with him a plough
452,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"that could go of itself, and plough three furrows at once. If Jacob"
453,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"would show him such a plough as that, then he might marry Gretchen and"
454,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,welcome. That was what the Herr Mayor said.
455,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
456,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"Jacob did not know how about that; perhaps he could get such a plough,"
457,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"perhaps he could not. If such a plough was to be had, though, he would"
458,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"have it. So off he went home again, and the Herr Mayor thought that he"
459,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,was rid of him now for sure and certain.
460,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
461,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"But when Jacob had come home, he went back of the woodpile and blew a"
462,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,turn or two on the little bone whistle that the red stranger had given
463,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,him. No sooner had he done this than the other stood before him as
464,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,suddenly as though he had just stepped out of the door of nowheres.
465,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
466,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""What do you want, Jacob?"" said he."
467,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
468,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""I would like,"" said Jacob, ""to have a plough that can go by itself and"
469,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"plough three furrows at once."""
470,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
471,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""That you shall have,"" said the red one. Then he thrust his hand into"
472,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"his breeches pocket, and drew forth the prettiest little plough that you"
473,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"ever saw. He stood it on the ground before Jacob, and it grew large as"
474,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"you see it in the picture. ""Plough away,"" said he, and then he went back"
475,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,again whither he had come.
476,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
477,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,So Jacob laid his hands to the plough and--whisk!--away it went like
478,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"John Stormwetter's colt, with Jacob behind it. Out of the farm-yard they"
479,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"went, and down the road, and so to the Herr Mayor's house, and behind"
480,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"them lay three fine brown furrows, smoking in the sun."
481,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
482,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"When the Herr Mayor saw them coming he opened his eyes, you may be sure,"
483,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,for he had never seen such a plough as that in all of his life before.
484,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
485,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""And now,"" said Jacob, ""I should like to marry Gretchen, if you"
486,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"please."""
487,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
488,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,At this the Herr Mayor hemmed and hawed and scratched his head again.
489,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"No; Jacob could not marry Gretchen yet, for the Herr Mayor had always"
490,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,said and sworn that the man who married Gretchen should bring with him a
491,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"purse that always had two pennies in it and could never be emptied, no"
492,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,matter how much was taken out of it.
493,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
494,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,[Illustration: Jacob and the Magic Plough]
495,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
496,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,Jacob did not know how about that; perhaps he could get it and perhaps
497,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"he could not. If such a thing was to be had, though, he would have it,"
498,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,as sure as the Mecklenburg folks brew sour beer. So off he went home
499,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"again, and the Herr Mayor thought that now he was rid of him for"
500,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,certain.
501,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
502,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"But Jacob went back of the woodpile and blew on his bone whistle again,"
503,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,and once more the red one came at his bidding.
504,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
505,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""What will you have now?"" said he to Jacob."
506,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
507,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""I should like,"" said Jacob, ""to have a purse which shall always have"
508,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"two pennies in it, no matter how much I take out of it."""
509,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
510,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""That you shall have,"" said the red one; whereupon he thrust his hand"
511,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"into his pocket, and fetched out a beautiful silken purse with two"
512,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"pennies in it. He gave the purse to Jacob, and then he went away again"
513,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,as quickly as he had come.
514,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
515,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"After he had gone, Jacob began taking pennies out of his purse and"
516,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"pennies out of his purse, until he had more than a hatful--hui! I would"
517,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,like to have such a purse as that.
518,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
519,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"Then he marched off to the Herr Mayor's house with his chin up, for he"
520,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"might hold his head as high as any, now that he had such a purse as that"
521,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"in his pocket. As for the Herr Mayor, he thought that it was a nice,"
522,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,pretty little purse; but could it do this and that as he had said?
523,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
524,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,Jacob would show him that; so he began taking pennies and pennies out of
525,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"it, until he had filled all the pots and pans in the house with them."
526,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,And now might he marry Gretchen?
527,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
528,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,Yes; that he might! So said the Herr Mayor; for who would not like to
529,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,have a lad for a son-in-law who always had two pennies more in his purse
530,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,than he could spend.
531,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
532,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"So Jacob married his Gretchen, and, between his plough and his purse, he"
533,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"was busy enough, I can tell you."
534,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
535,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,So the days went on and on and on until the ten years had gone by and
536,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,the time had come for the red one to fetch Jacob away with him. As for
537,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"Jacob, he was in a sorry state of dumps, as you may well believe."
538,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
539,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"At last Gretchen spoke to him. ""See, Jacob,"" said she, ""what makes you"
540,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"so down in the mouth?"""
541,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
542,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""Oh! nothing at all,"" said Jacob."
543,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
544,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"But this did not satisfy Gretchen, for she could see that there was more"
545,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"to be told than Jacob had spoken. So she teased and teased, until at"
546,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"last Jacob told her all, and that the red one was to come the next day"
547,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"and take him off as his servant, unless he could ask him a question"
548,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,which he could not answer.
549,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
550,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""Prut!"" said Gretchen, ""and is that all? Then there is no stuffing to"
551,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"that sausage, for I can help you out of your trouble easily enough."""
552,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,Then she told Jacob that when the next day should come he should do thus
553,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"and so, and she would do this and that, and between them they might"
554,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,cheat the red one after all.
555,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
556,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"So, when the next day came, Gretchen went into the pantry and smeared"
557,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,herself all over with honey. Then she ripped open a bed and rolled
558,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,herself in the feathers.
559,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
560,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,By-and-by came the red one. Rap! tap! tap! he knocked at the door.
561,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
562,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""Are you ready to go with me now, Jacob?"" said he."
563,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
564,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"Yes; Jacob was quite ready to go, only he would like to have one favor"
565,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,granted him first.
566,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
567,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""What is it that you want?"" said the red one."
568,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
569,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""Only this,"" said Jacob: ""I would like to shoot one more shot out of my"
570,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"old gun before I go with you."""
571,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
572,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"Oh, if that was all, he might do that and welcome. So Jacob took down"
573,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"his gun, and he and the red one went out together, walking side by side,"
574,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,for all the world as though they were born brothers.
575,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
576,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,[Illustration: Jacob and the Red One go hunting together]
577,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
578,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"By-and-by they saw a wren. ""Shoot at that,"" said the red one."
579,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
580,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""Oh no,"" said Jacob, ""that is too small."""
581,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
582,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,So they went on a little farther.
583,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
584,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"By-and-by they saw a raven. ""Shoot at that, then,"" said the red one."
585,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
586,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""Oh no,"" said Jacob, ""that is too black."""
587,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
588,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,So they went on a little farther.
589,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
590,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"By-and-by they came to a ploughed field, and there was something"
591,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,skipping over the furrows that looked for all the world like a great
592,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,bird. That was Gretchen; for the feathers stuck to the honey and all
593,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"over her, so that she looked just like a great bird."
594,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
595,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""Shoot at that! shoot at that!"" said the red one, clapping his hands"
596,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,together.
597,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
598,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""Oh yes,"" said Jacob, ""I will shoot at that."" So he raised his gun and"
599,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"took aim. Then he lowered his gun again. ""But what is it?"" said he."
600,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
601,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"At this the red one screwed up his eyes, and looked and looked, but for"
602,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,the life of him he could not tell what it was.
603,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
604,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""No matter what it is,"" said he, ""only shoot and be done with it, for I"
605,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"must be going."""
606,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
607,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""Yes, good! But what _is_ it?"" said Jacob."
608,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
609,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"Then the red one looked and looked again, but he could tell no better"
610,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"this time than he could before. ""It may be this and it may be that,"""
611,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"said he. ""Only shoot and be done with it, for they are waiting for me at"
612,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"home."""
613,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
614,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""Yes, my friend,"" said Jacob, ""that is all very good; only tell me what"
615,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"it is and I will shoot."""
616,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
617,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""Thunder and lightning!"" bawled the red one, _""I do not know what it"
618,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"is!""_"
619,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
620,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"""Then be off with you!"" said Jacob, ""for, since you cannot answer my"
621,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"question, all is over between us two."""
622,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
623,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"At this the red one had to leave Jacob, so he fled away over hill and"
624,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"dale, bellowing like a bull."
625,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
626,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"As for Jacob and Gretchen, they went back home together, very well"
627,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,pleased with each other and themselves.
628,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,
629,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,"And the meaning of all this is, that many another"

631,THE SKILLFUL HUNTSMAN,in a pretty scrape only for his wife.

707,L'ENVOY,"And she chuckled and laughed, as she went, with a will."
708,L'ENVOY,"And yet, as she went,"
709,L'ENVOY,"Her body was bent,"

711,L'ENVOY,
712,L'ENVOY,"""Oh! why do you chuckle, old woman;"" says I,"

720,L'ENVOY,"Yet she loudly cried,"
721,L'ENVOY,"And gustily sighed,"

865,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF
866,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
867,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
868,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,Hans and Claus were born brothers. Hans was the elder and Claus was the
869,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,younger; Hans was the richer and Claus was the poorer--that is the way
870,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,that the world goes sometimes.
871,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
872,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Everything was easy for Hans at home; he drank much beer, and had"
873,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"sausages and white bread three times a day; but Claus worked and worked,"
874,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"and no luck came of it--that, also, is the way that the world goes"
875,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,sometimes.
876,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
877,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"One time Claus spoke to Hans of this matter. ""See, Hans,"" said he, ""you"
878,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"should give me some money, for that which belongs to one brother should"
879,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"help the other."""
880,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
881,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,But Hans saw through different colored spectacles than Claus. No; he
882,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,would do nothing of the kind. If Claus wanted money he had better go out
883,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"into, the world to look for it; for some folks said that money was"
884,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,rolling about in the wide world like peas on a threshing-floor. So said
885,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Hans, for Claus was so poor that Hans was ashamed of him, and wanted him"
886,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,to leave home so as to be rid of him for good and all.
887,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
888,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,This was how Claus came to go out into the world.
889,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
890,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"But before he went, he cut himself a good stout staff of hazel-wood to"
891,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,help his heavy feet over the road.
892,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
893,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Now the staff that Claus had cut was a rod of witch-hazel, which has"
894,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,the power of showing wherever treasure lies buried. But Claus knew no
895,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,more of that than the chick in the shell.
896,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
897,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"So off he went into the world, walking along with great contentment,"
898,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"kicking up little clouds of dust at every step, and whistling as gayly"
899,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,as though trouble had never been hatched from mares' eggs. By-and-by he
900,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"came to the great town, and then he went to the market-place and stood,"
901,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"with many others, with a straw in his mouth--for that meant that he"
902,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,wanted to take service with somebody.
903,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
904,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Presently there came along an old, old man, bent almost double with the"
905,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,weight of the years which he carried upon his shoulders. This was a
906,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"famous doctor of the black-arts. He had read as many as a hundred books,"
907,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,so that he was more learned than any man in all of the world--even the
908,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"minister of the village. He knew, as well as the birds know when the"
909,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"cherries are ripe, that Claus had a stick of witch-hazel, so he came to"
910,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"the market-place, peering here and peering there, just as honest folks"
911,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,do when they are looking for a servant. After a while he came to where
912,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Claus was, and then he stopped in front of him. ""Do you want to take"
913,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"service, my friend?"" said he."
914,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
915,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Yes, that was what Claus wanted; why else should he stand in the"
916,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,market-place with a straw in his mouth?
917,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
918,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Well, they bargained and bargained, and talked and talked, and the end"
919,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,of the matter was that Claus agreed to sell his services to the old
920,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,master of black-arts for seven pennies a week. So they made their
921,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"bargain, and off went the master with Claus at his heels. After they had"
922,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"come a little distance away from the crowd at the marketplace, the"
923,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,master of black-arts asked Claus where he had got that fine staff of
924,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,hazel.
925,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
926,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,[Illustration: Claus and the Master of Black-Arts]
927,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
928,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"""Oh, I got it over yonder,"" said Claus, pointing with his thumb."
929,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
930,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,But could he find the place again?
931,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
932,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Well, Claus did not know how about that; perhaps he could, and perhaps"
933,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,he could not.
934,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
935,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"But suppose that Claus had a thaler in his hand, _then_ could he find"
936,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,the place again?
937,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
938,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,Oh yes; in that case Claus was almost sure that he could find the place
939,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,again.
940,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
941,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,So good. Then here was a bottle of yellow water. If Claus would take the
942,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"bottle of yellow water, and pour it over the stump from which he had cut"
943,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"his staff, there would come seven green snakes out of a hole at the foot"
944,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"of the hazel-bush. After these seven snakes, there would come a white"
945,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"snake, with a golden crown on its head, from out of the same hole. Now"
946,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"if Claus would catch that white snake in the empty bottle, and bring it"
947,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"to the master of black-arts, he should have not one thaler, but"
948,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,two--that was what the master said.
949,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
950,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Oh yes, Claus could do that; that was no such hard thing. So he took the"
951,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,bottle of yellow water and off he went.
952,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
953,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,By-and-by he came to the place where he had cut his hazel-twig. There he
954,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,did as the master of black-arts had told him; he poured the yellow water
955,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,over the stump of hazel from which he had cut his staff. Then everything
956,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,happened just as the other had said: first there came seven green snakes
957,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"out of the hole at the foot of the hazel-bush, and after they had all"
958,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"gone, there came a white snake, with a little golden crown on its head,"
959,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,and with its body gleaming like real silver. Then Claus caught the white
960,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"snake, and put it into the bottle and corked it up tightly. After he had"
961,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,done this he went back to the master of black-arts again.
962,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
963,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,Now this white snake was what the folk call a tomtsnake in that land.
964,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,Whoever eats of a broth made of it can understand the language of all
965,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field; so nobody need
966,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,wonder that the master was as glad as glad could be to have his white
967,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,snake safe and sound.
968,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
969,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,[Illustration: Claus and the White Snake]
970,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
971,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"He bade Claus build a fire of dry wood, and as soon as there was a good"
972,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,blaze he set a pot of water upon it to boil. When the water in the pot
973,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"began to boil, he chopped up the white snake into little pieces and"
974,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"threw them into it. So the snake boiled and boiled and boiled, and Claus"
975,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,stared with wonder as though he would never shut his eyes again.
976,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
977,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Now it happened that just about the time that the broth was cooked, the"
978,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,master was called out of the room for this or for that. No sooner was
979,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"his back turned than Claus began to wonder what the broth was like. ""I"
980,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"will just have a little taste,"" said he to himself; ""surely it can do no"
981,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"harm to the rest of the soup."" So he stuck his finger first into the"
982,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,broth and then into his mouth; but what the broth tasted like he never
983,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"could tell, for just then the master came in again, and Claus was so"
984,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,frightened at what he had done that he had no wits to think of the taste
985,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,of anything.
986,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
987,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Presently the master of black-arts went to the pot of broth, and, taking"
988,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"off the lid, began smelling of it. But no sooner had he sniffed a smell"
989,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"of the steam than he began thumping his head with his knuckles, and"
990,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"tearing his hair, and stamping his feet. ""_Somebody's had a finger in my"
991,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"broth!!!_"" he roared. For the master knew at once that all the magic had"
992,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,been taken out of it by the touch of Claus's finger.
993,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
994,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"As for poor Claus, he was so frightened that he fell upon his knees, and"
995,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"began begging: ""Oh! dear master--"" But he got no further than this, for"
996,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"the master bawled at him,"
997,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
998,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"""You have taken the best,"
999,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"You may have the rest."""
1000,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1001,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"And so saying, he threw pot and broth and all at Claus, so that if he"
1002,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,hadn't ducked his head he might have been scalded to death. Then Claus
1003,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"ran out into the street, for he saw that there was no place for him to"
1004,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,stay in that house.
1005,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1006,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Now in the street there was a cock and a hen, scratching and clucking"
1007,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"together in the dust, and Claus understood every word that they said to"
1008,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"each other, so he stopped and listened to them."
1009,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1010,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,This is what they said:
1011,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1012,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"The cock said to the hen, ""Yonder goes our new serving-man."""
1013,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1014,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"And the hen said to the cock, ""Yes, yonder he goes."""
1015,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1016,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"And the cock said to the hen, ""He is leaving the best behind him."""
1017,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1018,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,[Illustration: THE MASTER IS ANGRY]
1019,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1020,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"And the hen said to the cock, ""What is it that he is leaving?"""
1021,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1022,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"And the cock said to the hen, ""He is leaving behind him the witch-hazel"
1023,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"staff that he brought with him."""
1024,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1025,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"And the hen said to the cock, ""Yes, that is so. He would be a fool to"
1026,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"leave that behind, yet he is not the first one to think that peas are"
1027,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"pebbles."""
1028,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1029,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"As for Claus, you can guess how he opened his eyes, for he saw how the"
1030,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"land lay, and that he had other ears than he had before."
1031,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1032,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"""Hui!"" said he, ""that is good! I have bought more for my penny than I"
1033,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"had in my bargain."""
1034,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1035,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"As for the hazel staff, he was not going to leave that behind, you may"
1036,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,be sure. So he sneaked about the place till he laid hand on it again;
1037,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"then he stepped away, right foot foremost, for he did not know what the"
1038,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,master of black-arts might do to him if he should catch him.
1039,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1040,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Well, after he had left the town, he went along, tramp! tramp! tramp!"
1041,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"until, by-and-by, he grew tired and sat down beneath an oak-tree to rest"
1042,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,himself.

1046,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Now, as he sat there, looking up through the leaves, thinking of nothing"
1047,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"at all, two ravens came flying and lit in the tree above him. After a"
1048,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"while the ravens began talking together, and this was what they said:"
1049,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1050,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"The one raven said, ""Yonder is poor Claus sitting below us."""
1051,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1052,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"And the other raven said, ""_Poor_ Claus, did you say, brother? Do you"
1053,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"not see the witch-hazel lying on the ground beside him?"""
1054,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1055,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"The one raven said, ""Oh yes; I see that, but what good does it do him?"""
1056,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1057,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"And the other raven said, ""It does him no good now, but if he were to go"
1058,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,home again and strike on the great stone on the top of the hill back of
1059,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Herr Axel's house, then it would do him good; for in it lies a great"
1060,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"treasure of silver and gold."""
1061,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1062,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Claus had picked up his ears at all this talk, you may be sure. ""See,"""
1063,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"said he, ""that is the way that a man will pass by a great fortune in the"
1064,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,little world at home to seek for a little fortune in the great world
1065,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"abroad""--which was all very true. After that he lost no time in getting"
1066,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,back home again.
1067,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1068,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"""What! are you back again?"" said Hans."
1069,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1070,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"""Oh yes,"" said Claus, ""I am back again."""
1071,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1072,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"""That is always the way with a pewter penny,"" said Hans--for that is how"
1073,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,some of us are welcomed home after we have been away.
1074,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1075,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"As for Claus, he was as full of thoughts as an egg is of meat, but he"
1076,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,said nothing of them to Hans. Off he went to the high hill back of Herr
1077,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Axel's house, and there, sure enough, was the great stone at the very"
1078,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,top of the hill.
1079,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1080,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Claus struck on the stone with his oaken staff, and it opened like the"
1081,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"door of a beer vault, for all was blackness within. A flight of steps"
1082,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"led down below, and down the steps Claus went. But when he had come to"
1083,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"the bottom of the steps, he stared till his eyes were like great round"
1084,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"saucers; for there stood sacks of gold and silver, piled up like bags of"
1085,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,grain in the malt-house.
1086,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1087,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,[Illustration: Claus and the Manikin]
1088,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1089,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"At one end of the room was a great stone seat, and on the seat sat a"
1090,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"little manikin smoking a pipe. As for the beard of the little man, it"
1091,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"was as long as he was short, for it hung down so far that part of it"
1092,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,touched the stone floor.
1093,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1094,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"""How do you find yourself, Claus?"" said the little manikin, calling"
1095,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,Claus by his name.
1096,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1097,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"""So good!"" said Claus, taking off his hat to the other."
1098,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1099,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"""And what would you like to have, Claus?"" said the little man."
1100,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1101,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"""I would like,"" said Claus, ""to have some money, if you please."""
1102,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1103,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"""Take what you want,"" said the little man, ""only do not forget to take"
1104,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"the best with you."""
1105,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1106,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,Oh no; Claus would not forget the best; so he held the staff tighter
1107,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,than ever in his fist--for what could be better than the staff that
1108,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"brought him there? So he went here and there, filling his pockets with"
1109,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,the gold and silver money till they bulged out like the pockets of a
1110,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"thief in the orchard; but all the time he kept tight hold of his staff,"
1111,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,I can tell you.
1112,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1113,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"When he had as much as his pockets could hold, he thanked the little"
1114,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"manikin and went his way, and the stone door closed behind him."
1115,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1116,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,And now Claus lived like a calf in the green corn-field. Everything he
1117,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"had was of the best, and he had twice as much of that as any of the"
1118,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,neighbors. Then how brother Hans stared and scratched his head and
1119,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"wondered, when he saw how Claus sat in the sun all day, doing nothing"
1120,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"but smoking his pipe and eating of the best, as though he were a born"
1121,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,prince! Every day Claus went to the little man in the hill with his
1122,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"pockets empty, and came back with them stuffed with gold and silver"
1123,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"money. At last he had so much that he could not count it, and so he had"
1124,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"to send over to brother Hans for his quart-pot, so that he might measure"
1125,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,it.
1126,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1127,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"But Hans was cunning. ""I will see what makes brother Claus so well-off"
1128,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"in the world all of a sudden,"" said he; so he smeared the inside of the"
1129,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,quart-pot with bird-lime.
1130,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1131,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Then Claus measured his gold and silver money in Hans's quart-pot, and"
1132,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,when he was done with it he sent it back again. But more went back with
1133,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"the quart-pot than came with it, for two gold-pieces stuck to the"
1134,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"birdlime, and it was these that went back with the pot to brother Hans."
1135,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1136,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,[Illustration: Hans discovers Claus's Luck]
1137,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1138,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"""What!"" cried Hans, ""has that stupid Claus found so much money that he"
1139,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,has to measure it in a quart-pot? We must see the inside of this
1140,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"business!"" So off he went to Claus's house, and there he found Claus"
1141,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"sitting in the sun and smoking his pipe, just as though he owned all of"
1142,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,the world.
1143,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1144,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"""Where did you get all that money, Claus?"" said Hans."
1145,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1146,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,Oh! Claus could not tell him that.
1147,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1148,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"But Hans was bound to know all about it, so he begged and begged so"
1149,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"prettily that at last Claus had to tell him everything. Then, of course,"
1150,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,nothing would do but Hans must have a try with the hazel staff also.
1151,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1152,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Well, Claus made no words at that. He was a good-natured fellow, and"
1153,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,surely there was enough for both. So the upshot of the matter was that
1154,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,Hans marched off with the hazel staff.
1155,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1156,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"But Hans was no such simpleton as Claus; no, not he. Oh no, he would"
1157,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,not take all that trouble for two poor pocketfuls of money. He would
1158,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"have a bagful; no, he would have _two_ bagfuls. So he slung two meal"
1159,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"sacks over his shoulder, and off he started for the hill back of Herr"
1160,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,Axel's house.
1161,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1162,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"When he came to the stone he knocked upon it, and it opened to him just"
1163,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"as it had done for Claus. Down he went into the pit, and there sat the"
1164,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"little old manikin, just as he had done from the very first."
1165,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1166,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"""How do you find yourself, Hans?"" said the little old manikin."
1167,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1168,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Oh, Hans found himself very well. Might he have some of the money that"
1169,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,stood around the room in the sacks?
1170,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1171,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Yes, that he might; only remember to take the best away with him."
1172,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1173,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Prut! teach a dog to eat sausages. Hans would see that he took the best,"
1174,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"trust him for that. So he filled the bags full of gold, and never"
1175,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"touched the silver--for, surely, gold is better than anything else in"
1176,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"the world, says Hans to himself. So, when he had filled his two bags"
1177,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"with gold, and had shaken the pieces well down, he flung the one over"
1178,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"one shoulder, and the other over the other, and then he had as much as"
1179,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"he could carry. As for the staff of witch-hazel, he let it lie where it"
1180,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"was, for he only had two hands and they were both full."
1181,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1182,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"But Hans never got his two bags of gold away from the vault, for just as"
1183,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"he was leaving--bang! came the stone together, and caught him as though"
1184,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,he was a mouse in the door; and that was an end of him. That happened
1185,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,because he left the witch-hazel behind.
1186,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1187,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,That was the way in which Claus came to lose his magic staff; but that
1188,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"did not matter much, for he had enough to live on and to spare. So he"
1189,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,married the daughter of the Herr Baron (for he might marry whom he
1190,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"chose, now that he was rich), and after that he lived as happy as a fly"
1191,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,on the warm chimney.
1192,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,
1193,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"Now, _this_ is so--it is better to take a little away at a"
1194,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,"time and carry your staff with you, than to"
1195,CLAUS & HIS WONDERFUL STAFF,take all at once and leave it behind.

1312,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1313,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,Dame Margery Twist lived all alone with a great tabby cat. She dwelt in
1314,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"a little cottage that stood back from the road, and just across the way"
1315,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,from the butcher's shop. All within was as neat and as bright as a new

1355,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1356,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"""It's Tommy Lamb, if you please, ma'am,"" said a little voice."
1357,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1358,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"""Come in, Tommy,"" said the dame."

1366,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1367,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"The dame looked out of the window, but never a body stood there that she"

1372,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1373,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"The dame rubbed her eyes and looked again, but never a thing did she see"
1374,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"but the green gate, the lilac-bushes, and the butcher's shop opposite."
1375,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"The truth of the matter is, that little children like you, my dear, see"
1376,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"things which we grown folks, with the dust of the world in our eyes, may"
1377,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"never behold. ""Well,"" said Dame Margery to herself, ""this is strange,"
1378,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"for sure! _I_ see no little old gentleman in green."" Then she opened the"

1381,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"whereupon she did so. Then she looked again, and, lo and behold! there"
1382,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"stood a little old man, no taller than Tommy Lamb. His face was as"

1384,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,the bare tree when the frost is about. He was dressed all in green from
1385,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"top to toe, and on his head was a tall green cap, with a bell at the"
1386,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"peak, which tinkled at every movement of his head. By his side stood a"
1387,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"great, tall, milk-white horse, with a long tail and mane tied with"

1391,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1392,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"Dame Margery went out to the little old gentleman in green, and asked"
1393,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,him what he would have with her. He told the dame that his wife was
1394,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"sorely sick, and that he wanted her to come and nurse her for the night."
1395,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"At this Dame Margery hemmed and hawed and shook her head, for she did"
1396,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"not like the thought of going out at night, she knew not where, and with"
1397,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,such a strange little body. Then the little man begged her and pleaded
1398,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"with her, and his voice and his words were as sweet as honey. At last he"
1399,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"persuaded her to go, promising her a good reward if she would nurse his"
1400,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,wife back into her health again. So the dame went back into the cottage
1401,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"to make ready for her journeying, throwing her red riding-cloak over her"
1402,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"shoulders, and drawing her thick shoes upon her feet. Then she filled"
1403,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"her reticule with a parcel of simples, in case they should be needed."
1404,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"After this she came out again, and climbed up behind the little man in"
1405,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"green, and so settled herself upon the pillion saddle for her ride. Then"
1406,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"the little man whistled to his horse, and away they went."
1407,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1408,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"They seemed to fly rather than ride upon the hard ground, for the hedges"
1409,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,and cottages and orchards flew past as though in a dream. But fast as
1410,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"they went, the old dame saw many things which she had never dreamed of"
1411,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"before. She saw all of the hedge-rows, the by-ways, the woods and fields"
1412,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,alive with fairy-folk. Each little body was busy upon his or her own
1413,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"business, laughing, chatting, talking, and running here and there like"

1417,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1418,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,So they came at last to a place which the dame knew was the
1419,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,three-tree-hill; but it was not the three-tree-hill which she had seen
1420,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"in all of her life before, for a great gateway seemed to open into it"
1421,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,and it was into this gateway that the little man in green urged the
1422,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,great white horse.
1423,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1424,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"After they had entered the hill, Dame Margery climbed down from the"
1425,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,pillion and stood looking about her. Then she saw that she was in a
1426,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"great hall, the walls of which were glistening with gold and silver,"
1427,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,while bright stones gleamed like so many stars all over the roof of the
1428,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,place. Three little fairy children were playing with golden balls on the
1429,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"floor, and when they saw the dame they stopped in their sport and stood"
1430,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"looking silently upon her with great, wide-opened eyes, just as though"
1431,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,they were little mortal children. In the corner of the room was a bed
1432,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"all of pure gold, and over the bed were spread coverlets of gold and"
1433,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"silver cloth, and in the bed lay a beautiful little lady, very white and"
1434,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,ill. Then Dame Margery knew well enough that every one of these little
1435,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,people were fairies.
1436,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1437,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"The dame nursed the fairy lady all that night, and by cock-crow in the"
1438,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,morning the little woman had ease from her pain.
1439,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1440,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,Then the little man spoke for the first time since Dame Margery had left
1441,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"home. ""Look'ee, Dame Margery,"" said he; ""I promised to pay you well and"
1442,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"I will keep my word. Come hither!"" So the dame went to him as he had"
1443,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"bidden her to do, and the little man filled her reticule with black"
1444,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"coals from the hearth. The dame said nothing, but she wondered much"
1445,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,whether the little man called this good pay for her pains. After this
1446,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"she climbed up on the great horse again, and behind the little man, and"
1447,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"they rode out of the place and home, where they were safe and sound"
1448,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,ere the day had fairly broken. But before the little man had left her he
1449,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,drew out another little box just like the one that Tommy Lamb had
1450,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"brought her the evening before, only this time the box was filled with"
1451,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"red ointment. ""Rub your eyes with this, Dame Margery,"" said he."
1452,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1453,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,[Illustration: DAME TWIST DRIVES AWAY THE LITTLE FOLKS]
1454,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1455,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"Now Dame Margery Twist knew butter from cheese, as the saying is. She"
1456,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,knew that the green salve was of a kind which very few people have had
1457,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,rubbed over their eyes in this world; that it was of a kind which poets
1458,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,would give their ears to possess--even were it a lump no larger than a
1459,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"pea. So, when she took the box of red ointment, she only rubbed one eye"
1460,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"with it--her left eye. Her right eye she pretended to rub, but, in"
1461,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"truth, she never touched it at all."
1462,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1463,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"Then the little man got upon his horse again, and rode away to his home"
1464,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,in the hill.
1465,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1466,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"After he had gone away, Dame Margery thought that she would empty her"
1467,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"reticule of the dirty black coals; so she turned it topsy-turvy, and"
1468,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"shook it over the hearth, and out tumbled--black coals? No; great lumps"
1469,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"of pure gold that shone bright yellow, like fire, in the light of the"
1470,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"candle. The good dame could scarcely believe her eyes, for here was"
1471,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,wealth enough to keep her in comfort for all the rest of her days.
1472,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1473,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,But Dame Margery's right eye! I wish I could only see what she saw with
1474,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,that right eye of hers! What was it she saw? That I will tell you.
1475,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1476,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"The next night was full moon, and Dame Margery came and looked out over"
1477,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"the fine bed of tulips, of which she was very proud. ""Hey-day!"" she"
1478,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"cried, and rubbed her eyes, in doubt as to whether she was asleep or"
1479,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"awake, for the whole place was alive with little folks."
1480,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1481,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"But she was awake, and it was certain that she saw them. Yes; there they"
1482,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"were--little men, little women, little children, and little babies, as"
1483,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,thick in the tulip bed as folks at a wedding. The little men sat smoking
1484,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,their pipes and talking together; the little women sat nursing their
1485,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"babies, singing to them or rocking them to sleep in cradles of tulip"
1486,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,flowers; the little children played at hide-and-seek among the
1487,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"flower-stalks. So the dame leaned out of the window, watching them with"
1488,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"great delight, for it is always a delight to watch the little folks at"
1489,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,their sports.

1493,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1494,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,After a while she saw where one of the tiny fairy children hid himself

1496,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"and high and low, but could find him nowhere. Then the old dame laughed"

1498,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"could not tell where he was. At last she could hold her peace no longer,"
1499,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"but called out in a loud voice, ""Look under the leaf, Blackcap!"""
1500,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,

1504,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"For fairies are very timid folk, and dread nothing more than to have"

1506,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,
1507,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,"So they never came back again to the dame's garden, and from that day to"

1509,HOW DAME MARGERY TWIST SAW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HER,whenever she went out the fairies scampered away before her like so many

1771,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Yes, Peter is clever."" So said his mother; but then every goose thinks"
1772,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,her own gosling a swan.
1773,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1774,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,The minister and all of the people of the village said Peter was but a

1776,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,a fool tumbles out of the tree but he lights on his toes. So now you
1777,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,shall hear how that Peter sold his two baskets of eggs for more than you
1778,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"or I could do, wise as we be."
1779,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1780,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Peter,"" said his mother."
1781,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1782,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Yes,"" said Peter, for he was well brought up, and always answered when"

1784,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1785,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""My dear little child, thou art wise, though so young now; how shall we"
1786,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"get money to pay our rent?"""
1787,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1788,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Sell the eggs that the speckled hen has laid,"" said Peter."
1789,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,

1791,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,

1798,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Now indeed art thou wise,"" said his mother, ""and I take thy meaning;"
1799,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"it is this, when we have spent all, we must do as the little birds do,"
1800,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"and trust in the good Heaven."" Peter meant nothing of the kind, but then"
1801,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,folks will think that such wise fellows as Peter and I mean more than we
1802,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"say, whence comes our wisdom."
1803,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1804,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"So the next day Peter started off to the town, with the basket full of"
1805,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,nice white eggs. The day was bright and warm and fair; the wind blew
1806,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"softly, and the wheatfields lay like green velvet in the sun. The"
1807,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"flowers were sprinkled all over the grass, and the bees kicked up their"
1808,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,yellow legs as they tilted into them. The garlic stuck up stout spikes
1809,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"into the air, and the young radishes were green and lusty. The brown"
1810,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"bird in the tree sang, ""Cuckoo! cuckoo!"" and Peter trudged contentedly"
1811,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"along, kicking up little clouds of dust at every footstep, whistling"
1812,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"merrily and staring up into the bright sky, where the white clouds hung"
1813,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"like little sheep, feeding on the wide blue field. ""If those clouds were"
1814,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"sheep, and the sheep were mine, then I would be a great man and very"
1815,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"proud,"" said Peter. But the clouds were clouds, and he was not a great"
1816,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"man; nevertheless, he whistled more merrily than ever, for it was very"
1817,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,nice to think of these things.
1818,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1819,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"So he trudged along with great comfort until high noontide, against"
1820,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"which time he had come nigh to the town, for he could see the red roofs"
1821,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,and the tall spires peeping over the crest of the next green hill. By
1822,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"this time his stomach was crying, ""Give! give!"" for it longed for bread"
1823,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"and cheese. Now, a great gray stone stood near by at the forking of the"
1824,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"road, and just as Peter came to it he heard a noise. ""Click! clack!"" he"
1825,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"turned his head, and, lo and behold! the side of the stone opened like a"
1826,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"door, and out came a little old man dressed all in fine black velvet."
1827,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Good-day, Peter,"" said he. ""Good-day, sir,"" said Peter, and he took off"
1828,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"his hat as he spoke, for he could see with half an eye that this little"
1829,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,old gentleman was none of your cheese-paring fine folks.
1830,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1831,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Will you strike a bargain with me for your eggs?"" said the little old"
1832,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"man. Yes, Peter would strike a bargain; what would the little gentleman"
1833,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"give him for his eggs? ""I will give you this,"" said the little old man,"
1834,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,and he drew a black bottle out of his pocket.
1835,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1836,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Peter took the bottle and turned it over and over in his hands. ""It is,"""
1837,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"said he, ""a pretty little, good little, sweet little bottle, but it is"
1838,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"not worth as much as my basket of eggs."""
1839,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1840,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Prut!"" said the little gentleman, ""now you are not talking like the"
1841,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,wise Peter. You should never judge by the outside of things. What would
1842,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"you like to have?"""
1843,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1844,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""I should like,"" said Peter, ""to have a good dinner."""
1845,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1846,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Nothing easier!"" said the little gentleman, and he drew the cork. Pop!"
1847,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"pop! and what should come out of the bottle but two tall men, dressed"
1848,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"all in blue with gold trimmings. ""What will you have, sir?"" said the"
1849,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,first of these to the little gentleman.
1850,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1851,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""A good dinner for two,"" said the little man."
1852,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1853,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"No sooner said than done; for, before you could say Frederic"
1854,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Strutzenwillenbachen, there stood a table, with a sweet, clean, white"
1855,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"cloth spread over it, and on this was the nicest dinner that you ever"
1856,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"saw, for there were beer and chitterlings, and cheese and good white"
1857,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"bread, fit for the king. Then Peter and the little man fell to with"
1858,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"might and main, and ate till they could eat no more. After they were"
1859,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"done, the two tall men took table and dishes and all back into the"
1860,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"bottle again, and the little gentleman corked it up."
1861,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1862,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,[Illustration: Clever Peter & the Little Gentleman in Black]
1863,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1864,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Yes,"" said Peter, ""I will give you my basket of eggs for the little"
1865,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"black bottle."" And so the bargain was struck. Then Peter started off"
1866,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"home, and the little man went back again into the great stone and closed"
1867,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,the door behind him. He took the basket of eggs with him; where he took
1868,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,it neither Peter nor I will ever be able to tell you.
1869,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1870,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"So Peter trudged along homeward, until, after a while, the day waxing"
1871,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"warm, he grew tired. ""I wish,"" said he, ""that I had a fine white horse"
1872,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"to ride."""
1873,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1874,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,Then he took the cork out of the bottle. Pop! pop! and out came the two
1875,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"tall fellows, just as they had done for the little old man. ""What will"
1876,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"you have, sir?"" said the first of them."
1877,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1878,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""I will have,"" said Peter, ""a fine white horse to ride."""
1879,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1880,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"No sooner said than done; for there, before him in the road, stood a"
1881,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"fine white horse, with a long mane and tail, just like so much spun"
1882,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"silk. In his mouth was a silver bit; on his back was a splendid saddle,"
1883,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,covered all over with gold and jewels; on his feet were shoes of pure
1884,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"gold, so that he was a very handsome horse indeed."
1885,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1886,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Peter mounted on his great horse and rode away home, as grand as though"
1887,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,he were a lord or a nobleman.
1888,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1889,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,Every one whom he met stopped in the middle of the road and looked after
1890,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"him. ""Just look at Peter!"" cried they; but Peter held his chin very"
1891,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"high, and rode along without looking at them, for he knew what a fine"
1892,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,sight he was on his white horse.
1893,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1894,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,And so he came home again.
1895,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1896,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""What didst thou get for thy eggs, my little duck?"" said his mother."
1897,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1898,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""I got a bottle, mother,"" said Peter."
1899,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1900,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Then at first Peter's mother began to think as others thought, that"
1901,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Peter was a dull block. But when she saw what a wonderful bottle it was,"
1902,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"and how it held many good things and one over, she changed her mind"
1903,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"again, and thought that her Peter was as wise as the moon."
1904,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1905,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,And now nothing was lacking in the cottage; if Peter and his mother
1906,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"wanted this, it came to them; if they wished for that, the two tall men"
1907,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,in the bottle fetched it. They lined the house all inside with pure
1908,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"gold, and built the chimneys of bricks of silver, so that there was"
1909,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,nothing so fine between all the four great rivers. Peter dressed in
1910,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"satin and his mother in silk, and everybody called him ""Lord Peter."""
1911,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Even the minister of the village said that he was no dull boy, for"
1912,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,nobody is dull who rides on horseback and never wears wooden shoes. So
1913,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,now Peter was a rich man.
1914,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1915,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,[Illustration: Clever Peter rides to the King's Palace upon his fine

1920,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1921,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"To this his mother said nothing, for surely her Peter was as good as any"

1923,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1924,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"So off Peter rode, dressed all in his best and seated astride of a grand"
1925,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,horse. At last he came to the palace which was finer than the handsome
1926,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"new house of Herr Mayor Kopff. Rap! rap! rap! Peter knocked at the door,"
1927,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"and presently came a neat servant girl and opened it to him. ""Is the"
1928,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"King at home, my dear?"" said Peter."
1929,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1930,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Yes, the King was at home; would he come into the parlor and sit down?"
1931,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"So Peter went into the parlor and sat down, and then the King came in,"
1932,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"dressed all in his best dressing-gown, with silver slippers upon his"
1933,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"feet, and a golden crown upon his head."
1934,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1935,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""What is your name?"" said the King."
1936,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1937,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Peter Stultzenmilchen,"" said Peter."
1938,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1939,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""And what do you want, Lord Peter,"" said the King; for, as I have said,"
1940,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Peter was dressed in his best clothes, and the old King thought that he"
1941,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,was a great lord.
1942,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1943,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""I want to marry your daughter,"" said Peter."
1944,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1945,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"To this the King said ""Hum-m-m,"" and Peter said nothing. Then the King"
1946,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,said that he had determined that no one should marry his daughter
1947,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"without bringing him a basketful of diamonds, rubies, topazes, emeralds,"
1948,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"pearls, and all manner of precious stones; for he thought by this to get"
1949,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,rid of Peter.
1950,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1951,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Is that all?"" said Peter. ""Nothing is easier."""
1952,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1953,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"So off he went, until he came to a chestnut woods just back of the royal"
1954,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,kitchen-garden. There he uncorked his bottle. Pop! pop! and out came the
1955,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"two tall men. ""What will you have, sir?"" said they. Peter told them what"
1956,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"he wanted, and it was no sooner said than done; for, there on the ground"
1957,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"before him, stood a basketful of all kinds of precious stones; each of"
1958,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"them was as large as a hen's egg, and over all of them was spread a"
1959,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,nice clean white napkin. So Peter took the basket on his arm and went
1960,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,back again to the palace.
1961,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1962,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"But how the King did open his eyes, to be sure, and how he stared!"
1963,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Now,"" said Peter, ""I should like to marry your daughter, if you"
1964,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"please."""
1965,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1966,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"At this the King hemmed and hawed again. No, Peter could not marry the"
1967,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Princess yet, for the King had determined that no man should marry his"
1968,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,daughter without bringing him a bird all of pure silver that could sing
1969,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"whenever it was wanted, and that more sweetly than a nightingale; for he"
1970,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"thought that now he should be rid of Peter, at any rate."
1971,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1972,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Nothing easier,"" said Peter, and off he went again."
1973,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1974,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"When he had come to the chestnut woods, he uncorked his bottle and told"
1975,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,the two tall men what he wanted. No sooner said than done; for there was
1976,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"a bird all of pure silver. And not only that, but the bird sat in a"
1977,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"little golden tree, and the leaves of the tree were emeralds, and rubies"
1978,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,hung like cherries from the branches.
1979,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1980,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,Then Peter wrapped this up in his handkerchief and took it to the
1981,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"palace. As for the King, he could not look at it or listen to it enough."
1982,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1983,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Now,"" said Peter, ""I should like to marry your daughter, if you"
1984,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"please."""
1985,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1986,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"But at this the King sang the same tune again. No, Peter could not marry"
1987,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"his daughter yet, for the King had determined that the man who was to"
1988,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"marry his daughter should first bring him a golden sword, so keen that"
1989,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"it could cut a feather floating in the air, yet so strong that it could"
1990,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,cut through an iron bar.
1991,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
1992,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Nothing easier,"" said Peter, and this time the men of the bottle"
1993,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"brought him such a sword as he asked for, and the hilt was studded all"
1994,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"over with precious stones, so that it was very handsome indeed. Then"
1995,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Peter brought it to the King, and it did as the King would have it--it"
1996,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"cut through a feather floating in the air; as for the iron bar, it cut"
1997,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,through that as easily as you would bite through a radish.

1999,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,[Illustration: Peter Eats With the King and Princess]
2000,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2001,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,And now it seemed as though there was nothing else to be done but to let
2002,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Peter marry the Princess. So the King asked him in to supper, and they"
2003,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"all three sat down together, the King and the Princess and Peter. And"
2004,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"it was a fine feast, I can tell you, for they had both white and red"
2005,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"wine, besides sausages and cheese, and real white bread and puddings,"
2006,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,and all manner of good things; for kings and princesses eat and drink of
2007,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,the best.
2008,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2009,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"As for Peter, he made eyes at the Princess, and the Princess looked down"
2010,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"on her plate and blushed, and Peter thought that he had never seen such"
2011,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,a pretty girl.
2012,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2013,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,After a while the King began to question Peter how he came by all these
2014,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"fine things--the precious stones, the silver bird, and the golden sword;"
2015,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"but no, Peter would not tell. Then the King and the Princess begged and"
2016,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"begged him, until, at last, Peter lost his wits and told all about the"
2017,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"bottle. Then the King said nothing more, and presently, it being nine"
2018,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"o'clock, Peter went to bed. After he had gone the King and the Princess"
2019,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"put their heads together, and the end of the matter was that the wicked"
2020,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,King went to Peter's room and stole the bottle from under the pillow
2021,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"where he had hidden it, and put one in its place that was as empty as a"
2022,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,beer barrel after the soldiers have been in the town; for the King and
2023,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,the Princess thought that it would be a fine thing to have the bottle
2024,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,for themselves.
2025,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2026,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"When the next morning had come, and they were all sitting at their"
2027,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"breakfast together, the King said, ""Now, Lord Peter, let us see what"
2028,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"your bottle will do; give us such and such a kind of wine."""
2029,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2030,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Nothing easier,"" said Peter. Then he uncorked the bottle, but not so"
2031,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,much as a single dead fly came out of it.
2032,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2033,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""But where is the wine?"" said the King."
2034,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2035,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""I do not know,"" said Peter."
2036,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2037,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,At this the King called him hard names and turned him out of the
2038,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"palace, neck and heels; so back poor Peter went to his mother with a"
2039,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"flea in his ear, as the saying is. Now he was poor again, and everybody"
2040,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"called him a dull block, for he rode no great white horse and he wore"
2041,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,wooden shoes.
2042,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2043,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Never mind,"" said his mother, ""here is another basket of eggs from the"
2044,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"speckled hen."" So Peter set off with these to the market town, as he had"
2045,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,done with the others before. When he had come to the great stone at the
2046,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"forking of the road, whom should he meet but the same little gentleman"
2047,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"he had met the first time. ""Will you strike a bargain?"" said he. Yes,"
2048,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Peter would strike a bargain, and gladly. Thereupon the little old man"
2049,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,brought out another black bottle.
2050,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2051,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Two men are in this bottle,"" said the little old man; ""when they have"
2052,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"done all that you want them to do, say 'brikket-ligg' and they will go"
2053,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"back again. Will you trade with me?"" Yes, Peter would trade. So Peter"
2054,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"gave the little man the eggs, and the little man gave Peter the second"
2055,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"bottle, and they parted very good friends."
2056,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2057,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"After a while Peter grew tired. ""Now,"" said he to himself, ""I will ride"
2058,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"a little""; and so he drew the cork out of the bottle. Pop! pop! out came"
2059,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"two men from the bottle; but this time they were ugly and black, and"
2060,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"each held a stout stick in his hand. They said not a word, but, without"
2061,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"more ado, fell upon Peter and began threshing him as though he was wheat"
2062,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"on the barn floor. ""Stop! stop!"" cried Peter, and he went hopping and"
2063,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"skipping up and down, and here and there, but it seemed as though the"
2064,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"two ugly black men did not hear him, for the blows fell as thick as"
2065,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"hail on the roof. At last he gathered his wits together, like a flock of"
2066,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"pigeons, and cried, ""Brikket-ligg! brikket-ligg!"" Then, whisk! pop! they"
2067,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"went back into the bottle again, and Peter corked it up, and corked it"
2068,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"tightly, I can tell you."
2069,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2070,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,[Illustration: Clever Peter and the Unlucky Bottle]
2071,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2072,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,The next day he started off to the palace once more. Rap! rap! rap! he
2073,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"knocked at the door. Was the King at home? Yes, the King was at home;"
2074,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,would he come and sit in the parlor?
2075,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2076,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Presently the King came in, in dressing-gown and slippers. ""What! are"
2077,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"you back again?"" said he."
2078,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2079,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Yes; I am back again,"" said Peter."
2080,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2081,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""What do you want?"" said the King."
2082,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2083,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""I want to marry the Princess,"" said Peter."
2084,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2085,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""What have you brought this time?"" said the King."
2086,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2087,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""I have brought another bottle,"" said Peter."
2088,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2089,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Then the King rubbed his hands and was very polite indeed, and asked"
2090,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Peter in to breakfast, and Peter went. So they all three sat down"
2091,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"together, the King, the Princess, and Peter."
2092,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2093,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""My dear,"" said the King, to the Princess, ""the Lord Peter has brought"
2094,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"another bottle with him."" Thereat the Princess was very polite also."
2095,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,Would Lord Peter let them see the bottle? Oh yes! Peter would do that:
2096,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,so he drew it out of his pocket and sat it upon the table.
2097,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2098,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Perhaps they would like to have it opened. Yes, that they would. So"
2099,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,Peter opened the bottle.
2100,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2101,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,Hui! what a hubbub there was! The King hopped about till his slippers
2102,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"flew off, his dressing-gown fluttered like great wings, and his crown"
2103,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"rolled off from his head and across the floor, like a quoit at the fair."
2104,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"As for the Princess, she never danced in all of her life as she danced"
2105,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,that morning. They made such a noise that the soldiers of the Royal
2106,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,Guard came running in; but the two tall black men spared them no more
2107,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,than the King and the Princess. Then came all of the Lords of the
2108,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Council, and they likewise danced to the same music as the rest."
2109,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2110,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Oh, Peter! dear Lord Peter! cork up your men again!"" they all cried."
2111,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2112,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Will you give me back my bottle?"" said Peter."
2113,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2114,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Yes! yes!"" cried the King."
2115,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2116,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Will you marry me?"" said Peter."
2117,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2118,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"""Yes! yes!"" cried the Princess."
2119,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2120,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"Then Peter said ""brikket-ligg!"" and the two tall men popped back into"
2121,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"the bottle again. So the King gave him back his other bottle, and the"
2122,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,minister was called in and married him to the Princess.
2123,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2124,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"After that he lived happily, and when the old King died he became King"
2125,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"over all of the land. As for the Princess, she was as good a wife as you"
2126,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,"ever saw, but Peter always kept the bottle near to him--maybe that was"
2127,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,the reason.
2128,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,
2129,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,Ah me! if I could only take my eggs to such a
2130,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,market and get two such bottles for them!
2131,CLEVER PETER & THE TWO BOTTLES,What would I do with them? It would

2236,YE TWO WISHES,"And, coming to a faggot-maker, begged a crust of bread"
2237,YE TWO WISHES,The faggot-maker gave a crust and something rather queer
2238,YE TWO WISHES,"To wash it down withall, from out a bottle that stood near."
2239,YE TWO WISHES,"The Angel finished eating; but before he left, said he,"
2240,YE TWO WISHES,"""Thou shalt have two wishes granted, for that thou hast given me."
2241,YE TWO WISHES,"One wish for that good drinkable, another for the bread."""
2242,YE TWO WISHES,The he left the faggot-maker all amazed at what he'd said.
2243,YE TWO WISHES,
2244,YE TWO WISHES,"""I wonder,"" says the faggot-maker, after he had gone,"
2245,YE TWO WISHES,"""I wonder if there's any truth in that same little song!"""
2246,YE TWO WISHES,"So, turning this thing over in his mind, he cast around,"
2247,YE TWO WISHES,'Till he saw the empty bottle where it lay upon the ground.
2248,YE TWO WISHES,"""I wish,"" said he, just as a test, ""if what he said is so,"
2249,YE TWO WISHES,"Into that empty bottle, now, that I may straightway go"""
2250,YE TWO WISHES,"No sooner said that done; for,--_Whisk!_ into the flask he fell,"
2251,YE TWO WISHES,Where he found himself as tightly packed as chicken in the shell.
2252,YE TWO WISHES,"In vain he kicked and twisted, and in vain he howled with pain;"
2253,YE TWO WISHES,"For, in spite of all his efforts, he could not get out again."
2254,YE TWO WISHES,"So, seeing how the matter stood, he had to wish once more."
2255,YE TWO WISHES,"When, out he slipped, as easily as he'd gone in before."
2256,YE TWO WISHES,
2257,YE TWO WISHES,"If we had two wishes, granted by an Angel thus,"
2258,YE TWO WISHES,We would not throw away the good so kindly given us.
2259,YE TWO WISHES,"For first we'd ask for wisdom, which, when we had in store,"
2260,YE TWO WISHES,I'm very doubtful if we'd care to ask for anymore.

2318,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2319,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,Hans Hecklemann had no luck at all. Now and then we hear folks say that
2320,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"they have no luck, but they only mean that their luck is bad and that"
2321,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,they are ashamed of it. Everybody but Hans Hecklemann had luck of some
2322,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"kind, either good or bad, and, what is more, everybody carries his luck"
2323,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"about with him; some carry it in their pocket-books, some carry it in"
2324,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"their hats, some carry it on their finger tips, and some carry it under"
2325,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,their tongues--these are lawyers. Mine is at this moment sitting astride
2326,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"of my pen, though I can no more see it than though it was thin air;"
2327,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,whether it is good or bad depends entirely as to how _you_ look upon it.
2328,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2329,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"But Hans Hecklemann had no luck at all. How he lost it nobody knows, but"
2330,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,it is certain that it was clean gone from him.
2331,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2332,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"He was as poor as charity, and yet his luck was not bad, for, poor as he"
2333,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"was, he always had enough for his wife and his family and himself to"
2334,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"eat. They all of them worked from dawn to nightfall, and yet his luck"
2335,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"was not good, for he never laid one penny on top of the other, as the"
2336,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"saying is. He had food enough to eat, and clothes enough to wear, so his"
2337,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"luck was not indifferent. Now, as it was neither good, bad, nor"
2338,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"indifferent, you see that it could have been no luck at all."
2339,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2340,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,Hans Hecklemann's wife was named Catherine. One evening when Hans came
2341,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,into the cottage with just enough money to buy them all bread and not a
2342,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"cracked farthing to spare, Catherine spoke to him of this matter."
2343,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2344,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Hans,"" said she, ""you have no luck at all."""
2345,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2346,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"[Illustration: Hans Hecklemann, Catherine.]"
2347,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2348,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""No,"" said Hans, ""I have not,"" which was the truth, as I have already"
2349,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,told you.
2350,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2351,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""What are you going to do about it?"" said Catherine."
2352,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2353,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Nothing at all,"" said Hans."
2354,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2355,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Doing nothing puts no cabbage into the pot,"" said Catherine."
2356,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2357,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""It takes none out,"" said Hans."
2358,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2359,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""See, Hans,"" said Catherine; ""go to the old wise woman in the wood and"
2360,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,talk to her about it; who knows but that she can tell you how and where
2361,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"you lost your luck?"""
2362,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2363,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""If I should find my luck it might be bad and not good,"" said Hans."
2364,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2365,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""It is worth having a look at,"" said Catherine; ""you can leave it where"
2366,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"you find it if it does not please you."""
2367,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2368,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""No,"" said Hans; ""when a man finds his luck he has to take it, whether"
2369,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"he likes it or no."""
2370,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2371,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"So Hans talked, but he had made up his mind to do as Catherine said, to"
2372,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"go and see the old wise woman in the wood. He argued with her, but he"
2373,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,only argued with her to let her know how little was her knowledge and
2374,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,how great was his. After he had clearly shown her how poor her advice
2375,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"was, he took it. Many other men are like Hans Hecklemann."
2376,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2377,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"So, early the next morning, Hans jogged along to the old wise woman's"
2378,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"cottage, while the day was sweet and fresh. The hedgerows were covered"
2379,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"all over with white blossoms, as though it was with so much snow; the"
2380,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"cuckoo was singing among the budding branches, and the little flowers"
2381,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"were looking up everywhere with their bright faces. ""Surely,"" said Hans"
2382,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"to himself, ""if I find my luck on this day, it must be good and not"
2383,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"ill."""
2384,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2385,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,So he came to the little red cottage at the edge of the wood wherein
2386,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,lived the wise woman who knew many things and one. Hans scraped his feet
2387,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"on the stones until they were clean, and then he knocked at the door."
2388,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2389,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Come in,"" said the old wise woman."
2390,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2391,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,She was as strange an old woman as one could hope to see in a lifetime.
2392,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"Her nose bent down to meet her chin, and her chin bent up to reach her"
2393,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"nose; her face was gray with great age, and her hair was as white as"
2394,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"snow. She wore a long red cloak over her shoulders, and a great black"
2395,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,cat sat on the back of her chair.
2396,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2397,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""What do you want, Son Hans?"" said she."
2398,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2399,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""I want to find my luck, mother,"" said Hans."
2400,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2401,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Where did you lose it, Son Hans?"" said she."
2402,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2403,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""That I do not know, mother,"" said Hans."
2404,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2405,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"Then the old wise woman said ""Hum-m-m!"" in a very thoughtful voice, and"
2406,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,Hans said nothing at all.
2407,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2408,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"After a while she spoke again. ""Have you enough to eat?"" said she."
2409,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2410,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Oh yes!"" said Hans."
2411,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2412,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Have you enough to drink?"" said she."
2413,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2414,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Plenty of water, enough of milk, but no beer,"" said Hans."
2415,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2416,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Have you enough clothes to cover you?"" said she."
2417,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2418,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Oh yes!"" said Hans."
2419,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2420,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Are you warm enough in winter?"" said she."
2421,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2422,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Oh yes!"" said Hans."
2423,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2424,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Then you had better leave well enough alone,"" said she, ""for luck can"
2425,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"give you nothing more."""
2426,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2427,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""But it might put money into my pocket,"" said Hans."
2428,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2429,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""And it might take away the good things that you already have,"" said"
2430,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,she.
2431,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2432,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""All the same, I should like to find it again,"" said Hans; ""if I could"
2433,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"only lay my hands on it I might make good out of it, even if it is bad."""
2434,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2435,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""I doubt that,"" said the old wise woman. Nevertheless, she saw that"
2436,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"Hans was set in his own way, and that he only talked stiffness into his"
2437,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"stubbornness. So she arose from her chair with much groaning, for her"
2438,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"joints were stiffened with age, and limping to a closet in the wall she"
2439,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,brought a book thence. Then she ran her finger down one page and up
2440,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"another, until she had found that which she sought. When she had found"
2441,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,it she spoke:
2442,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2443,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,[Illustration: Hans Hecklemann goes to the cottage of the old Wise Woman
2444,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,in search of his Luck.]
2445,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2446,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Son Hans, you lost your luck three years ago when you were coming from"
2447,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,the fair at Kneitlingen. You sat down on the overturned cross that lies
2448,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"where three roads meet, and it fell out of your pocket along with a"
2449,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"silver shilling. Now, Hans, your luck was evil, therefore it stuck to"
2450,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"the good sign, as all evil things of that kind must, like a fly to"
2451,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"butter. Also, I tell you this: when an evil manikin such as this touches"
2452,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"the sign of the good cross, he becomes visible to the eyes of everybody"
2453,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,who chooses to look upon him. Therefore go to the stone cross and you
2454,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"will find your luck running this way and that, but never able to get"
2455,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"away from it."" So saying, the old woman shut her book again. Then she"
2456,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,arose from her chair and went once more to the closet in the wall. This
2457,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"time she took from it a little sack woven of black goat's hair. ""When"
2458,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"you have found your luck again, put it into this little bag,"" said she;"
2459,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""once in it, no evil imp will be able to get out again so long as you"
2460,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"keep the strings tied. And now good-bye!"""
2461,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2462,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,[Illustration: Hans Hecklemann and the Old Wise-Woman]
2463,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2464,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"Then Hans slipped the little sack into his pocket, and set out for the"
2465,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,overturned stone cross where the three roads meet. When he had come to
2466,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"the place, he looked here and there, and this way and that, but for a"
2467,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"long time he could see nothing at all. At last, after much looking, he"
2468,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"beheld a little black beetle running hither and thither on the stone. ""I"
2469,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"wonder,"" said Hans, ""if this can be my luck."""
2470,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2471,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"So saying, he caught the little beetle betwixt his finger and thumb, but"
2472,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"very carefully, for he could not tell whether or not it might bite him."
2473,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"The beetle stuck to the stone as though it had been glued there, but, at"
2474,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"last, Hans pulled it away; then--lo! it was not a beetle that he held in"
2475,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"his hand, but a little manikin about as long as your thumb and as black"
2476,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"as ink. Hans Hecklemann was so frightened that he nearly dropped it, for"
2477,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,it kicked and screeched and rolled its red eyes in a very ugly way as he
2478,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"held it. However, he popped it into the little sack and pulled the"
2479,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"strings tight, and there it was, safe and sound."
2480,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2481,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,That is what Hans Hecklemann's luck was like.
2482,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2483,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,So Hans having his luck secure in the little sack began to bargain with
2484,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"it. ""What will you do for me if I let you out?"" said he."
2485,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2486,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Nothing at all,"" snarled his luck."
2487,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2488,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Very well,"" said Hans, ""we will see about that."""
2489,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2490,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"So he carried it home with him, and threw sack and all into a nasty pot"
2491,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,where Catherine cast the scrapings of the dishes--the fat and what not
2492,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,that she boiled down into soap now and then. There he left his luck to
2493,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"stay until the next day, and then he went to it again. ""What will you do"
2494,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"for me if I will let you out now?"" said he."
2495,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2496,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Nothing at all,"" snarled his luck."
2497,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2498,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Very well,"" said Hans, ""we will see about that."" So he let him stay"
2499,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,where he was for another day. And so the fiddle played; every day Hans
2500,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,Hecklemann went to his luck and asked it what it would give him if he
2501,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"would let it out, and every day his luck said nothing; and so a week"
2502,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,or more passed.
2503,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2504,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,[Illustration: Hans finds his Luck]
2505,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2506,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,At last Hans's luck gave in.
2507,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2508,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""See, Hans,"" it said one morning; ""if you will let me out of this nasty"

2510,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2511,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Ah no!"" said Hans. ""Thalers are only thalers, as my good father used to"
2512,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"say. They melt away like snow, and then nothing is left of them. I will"

2514,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2515,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""I will give you two thousand thalers,"" said his luck."

2518,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,

2521,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,

2527,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2528,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Done!"" said Hans's luck."
2529,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2530,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Done!"" said Hans."
2531,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2532,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"Then he opened the mouth of the sack, and--puff! went his luck, like"
2533,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"wind out of a bag, and--pop! it slipped into his breeches pocket."
2534,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2535,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"He never saw it again with his mortal eyes, but it stayed near to him, I"
2536,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"can tell you. ""Ha! ha! ha!"" it laughed in his pocket, ""you have made an"
2537,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"ill bargain, Hans, I can tell you!"""
2538,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2539,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Never mind,"" said Hans, ""I am contented."""
2540,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2541,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,Hans Hecklemann did not tarry long in trying the new luck of his old
2542,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"plough, as you may easily guess. Off he went like the wind and borrowed"
2543,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,Fritz Friedleburg's old gray horse. Then he fastened the horse to the
2544,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,plough and struck the first furrow. When he had come to the end of
2545,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"it--pop! up shot a golden noble, as though some one had spun it up from"
2546,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"the ground with his finger and thumb. Hans picked it up, and looked at"
2547,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,it and looked at it as though he would swallow it with his eyes. Then he
2548,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,seized the handle of the plough and struck another furrow--pop! up went
2549,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"another golden noble, and Hans gathered it as he had done the other one."
2550,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"So he went on all of that day, striking furrows and gathering golden"
2551,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,nobles until all of his pockets were as full as they could hold. When it
2552,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,was too dark to see to plough any more he took Fritz Friedleburg's horse
2553,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"back home again, and then he went home himself."
2554,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2555,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"All of his neighbors thought that he was crazy, for it was nothing but"
2556,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"plough, plough, plough, morning and noon and night, spring and summer"
2557,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,and autumn. Frost and darkness alone kept him from his labor. His stable
2558,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"was full of fine horses, and he worked them until they dropped in the"
2559,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,furrows that he was always ploughing.
2560,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2561,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"""Yes; Hans is crazy,"" they all said; but when Hans heard them talk in"
2562,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"this way he only winked to himself and went on with his ploughing, for"
2563,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,he felt that he knew this from that.
2564,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2565,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"But ill luck danced in his pocket with the golden nobles, and from the"
2566,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,day that he closed his bargain with it he was an unhappy man. He had no
2567,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"comfort of living, for it was nothing but work, work, work. He was up"
2568,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"and away at his ploughing at the first dawn of day, and he never came"
2569,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"home till night had fallen; so, though he ploughed golden nobles, he did"
2570,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,not turn up happiness in the furrows along with them. After he had eaten
2571,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"his supper he would sit silently behind the stove, warming his fingers"
2572,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,and thinking of some quicker way of doing his ploughing. For it seemed
2573,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"to him that the gold-pieces came in very slowly, and he blamed himself"
2574,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,that he had not asked his luck to let him turn up three at a time
2575,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,instead of only one at the end of each furrow; so he had no comfort in
2576,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,his gathering wealth. As day followed day he grew thin and haggard and
2577,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"worn, but seven boxes of bright new gold-pieces lay hidden in the"
2578,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"cellar, of which nobody knew but himself. He told no one how rich he was"
2579,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"growing, and all of his neighbors wondered why he did not starve to"
2580,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,death.
2581,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2582,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,So you see the ill luck in his breeches pocket had the best of the
2583,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"bargain, after all."
2584,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2585,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"After Hans had gone the way of all men, his heirs found the chests full"
2586,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"of gold in the cellar, and therewith they bought fat lands and became"
2587,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,noblemen and gentlemen; but that made Hans's luck none the better.
2588,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2589,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,From all this I gather:
2590,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,
2591,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,That few folks can turn ill luck into good luck.
2592,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,That the best thing for one to do is to let well enough alone.
2593,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,That one cannot get happiness as one does cabbages--with
2594,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,money.
2595,HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK,"That happiness is the only good luck, after all!"

2802,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2803,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,Did you ever hear of a boggart? No! Then I will tell you. A boggart is a
2804,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"small imp that lives in a man's house, unseen by any one, doing a little"
2805,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"good and much harm. This imp was called a boggart in the old times, now"
2806,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"we call such by other names--ill-temper, meanness, uncharitableness, and"
2807,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"the like. Even now, they say, you may find a boggart in some houses."
2808,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,There is no placing reliance on a boggart; sometimes he may seem to be
2809,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"of service to his master, but there is no telling when he may do him an"

2811,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2812,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,Rap! tap! tap! came a knock at the door.

2814,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"The wind was piping Jack Frost's, for the time was winter, and it blew"

2816,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"and the hay-ricks looked as though each one wore a dunce-cap, like the"
2817,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,dull boy in Dame Week's school over by the green. The icicles hung down
2818,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"by the thatch, and the little birds crouched shivering in the bare and"
2819,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,leafless hedge-rows.
2820,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2821,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,But inside the farm-house all was warm and pleasant; the great logs
2822,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"snapped and crackled and roared in the wide chimney-place, throwing red"
2823,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"light up and down the walls, so that the dark night only looked in"
2824,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,through the latticed windows. Farmer Griggs sat warming his knees at
2825,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"the blaze, smoking his pipe in great comfort, while his crock of ale,"
2826,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"with three roasted crab-apples bobbing about within it, warmed in the"
2827,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"hot ashes beside the blazing logs, simmering pleasantly in the ruddy"

2836,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2837,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"But, rap! tap! tap! came a knock at the door."
2838,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2839,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Then Farmer Griggs took his pipe from out his mouth. ""Did'ee hear un,"

2841,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,

2848,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"""Will you let me in out of the cold, Georgie Griggs?"" piped a small"
2849,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,voice. Farmer Griggs looked down and saw a little wight no taller than
2850,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,his knee standing in the snow on the door-step. His face was as brown as

2852,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"those of a toad. The red light of the fire shone on him, and Georgie"
2853,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,Griggs saw that his feet were bare and that he wore no coat.
2854,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2855,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"""Who be 'ee, little man?"" said Farmer Griggs."
2856,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2857,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"""I'm a boggart, at your service."""
2858,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,

2860,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"room in my house to the likes o' thee""; and he made as though he would"
2861,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,have shut the door in the face of the little urchin.
2862,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2863,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"""But listen, Georgie Griggs,"" said the boggart; ""I will do you a good"
2864,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"service."""
2865,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2866,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Then Farmer Griggs did listen. ""What sarvice will'ee do me, then?"" said"
2867,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,he.

2882,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2883,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Then Farmer Griggs listened a little longer without shutting the door,"
2884,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"and so did Dame Griggs. ""What's thy name, boggart?"" said he."
2885,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2886,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"""Hardfist,"" said the boggart; and he came a little farther in at the"
2887,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"door, for he saw that Farmer Griggs had a mind to let him in all of the"
2888,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,way.
2889,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2890,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"""I don't know,"" said Georgie Griggs, scratching his head doubtfully;"

2895,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"cold air intull th' room."""
2896,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2897,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Then Farmer Griggs shut the door, but the boggart was on the inside."
2898,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2899,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"This is the way in which the boggart came into Farmer Griggs's house,"
2900,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"and there he was to stay, for it is no such easy matter getting rid of"
2901,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"the likes of him when we once let him in, I can tell you."
2902,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2903,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"The boggart came straightway over to the warm fire, and the dog"
2904,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"growled--""chur-r-r-r!""--and showed his teeth, and the cat spit anger and"
2905,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"jumped up on the dresser, with her back arched and her tail on end. But"
2906,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"the boggart cared never a whit for this, but laid himself comfortably"
2907,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,down among the warm ashes.
2908,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2909,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Now imps, like this boggart, can only be seen as the frost is seen--when"
2910,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"it is cold. So as he grew warmer and warmer, he grew thin, like a"
2911,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"jelly-fish, and at last, when he had become thoroughly warmed through,"
2912,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,Farmer Griggs and the dame could see him no more than though he was thin
2913,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"air. But he was in the house, and he stayed there, I can tell you. For a"
2914,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,time everything went as smooth as cream; all of the work of the house
2915,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"was done as though by magic, for the boggart did all that he had"
2916,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"promised; he made the fires, he baked the bread, he washed the dishes,"
2917,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"he scoured the pans, he scrubbed the floors, he brewed the beer, he"
2918,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"roasted the meat, he stuffed the sausages, he skimmed the milk, he made"
2919,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"the butter, he pressed the cheese, he plucked the geese, he spun the"
2920,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"thread, he knit the stockings, he mended the clothes, he patched the"
2921,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,shoes--he was everywhere and did all of the work of the house. When
2922,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Farmer Griggs saw these things done, and so deftly, he rubbed his hands"
2923,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,and chuckled to himself. He sent cook and scullion and serving maid
2924,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"a-packing, there being nothing for them to do, for, as I said, all of"
2925,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"these things were done as smooth as cream. But after a time, and when"
2926,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"the boggart's place had become easy to him, like an old shoe, mischief"
2927,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,began to play the pipes and he began to show his pranks. The first thing
2928,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"that he did was to scrape the farmer's butter, so that it was light of"
2929,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"weight, and all of the people of the market town hooted at him for"
2930,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"giving less than he sold. Then he skimmed the children's milk, so that"
2931,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,they had nothing but poor watery stuff to pour over their pottage of a
2932,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"morning. He took the milk from the cat, so that it was like to starve;"
2933,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,he even pilfered the bones and scrapings of the dishes from the poor
2934,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"house-dog, as though he was a very magpie. He blew out the rush-lights,"
2935,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,so that they were all in the dark after sunset; he made the fires burn
2936,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"cold, and played a hundred and forty other impish tricks of the like"
2937,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"kind. As for the poor little children, they were always crying and"
2938,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,complaining that the boggart did this and the boggart did that; that he
2939,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,scraped the butter from their bread and pulled the coverlids off of them
2940,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,at night.
2941,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2942,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Still the boggart did his work well, and so Farmer Griggs put up with"
2943,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,his evil ways as long as he could. At last the time came when he could
2944,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"bear it no longer. ""Look'ee, now, Mally,"" said he to his dame, ""it's all"
2945,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,along o' thee that this trouble's coome intull th' house. I'd never let
2946,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"the boggart in with my own good-will!"" So spoke Farmer Griggs, for even"
2947,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,nowadays there are men here and there who will now and then lay their
2948,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,own bundle of faults on their wives' shoulders.
2949,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2950,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"""I bade thee do naught but shut the door!"" answered Dame Griggs."
2951,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2952,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"""Ay; it's easy enough to shut the door after the trouble's come in!"""
2953,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2954,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"""Then turn it out again!"""
2955,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2956,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"""Turn un out! Odds bodkins, that's woman's wit! Dost'ee not see that"
2957,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"there's no turnin' o' un out? Na, na; there's naught to do but to go out"
2958,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"ourselves!"""
2959,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2960,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Yes; there was nothing else to be done. Go they must, if they would be"
2961,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"rid of the boggart. So one fine bright day in the blessed spring-time,"
2962,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"they packed all of their belongings into a great wain, or cart, and set"
2963,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,off to find a new home.
2964,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2965,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Oft they trudged, just as you see in the picture, the three little"
2966,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"children seated high up in the wain, and the farmer and the dame"
2967,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,plodding ahead.
2968,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2969,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,[Illustration: THE DEPARTURE.]
2970,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2971,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,[Illustration: Farmer Griggs and the Wise Man.]
2972,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2973,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Now, as they came to the bottom of Shooter's Hill, whom should they meet"
2974,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"but their good neighbor and gossip, Jerry Jinks. ""So, Georgie,"" said he,"
2975,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"""you're leavin' th' ould house at last?"""
2976,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2977,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"""High, Jerry,"" quoth Georgie. ""We were forced tull it, neighbor, for"
2978,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,that black boggart torments us so that there was no rest night or day
2979,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"for it. The poor bairns' stomachs are empty, and the good dame's nigh"
2980,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"dead for it. So off we go, like th' field-fares in the autumn--we're"
2981,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"flittin', we're flittin'!"""
2982,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2983,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Now on the wain was a tall, upright churn; as soon as Georgie had ended"
2984,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"his speech, the lid of the churn began to clipper-clapper, and who"
2985,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"should speak out of it but the boggart himself. ""Ay, Jerry!"" said he,"
2986,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"""we're a flittin', we're a flittin', man! Good-day to ye, neighbor,"
2987,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"good-day to ye! Come and see us soon time!"""
2988,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2989,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"""High!"" cried Georgie Griggs, ""art thou there, thou black imp? Dang un!"
2990,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"We'll all go back tull th' old house, for sure it's better to bear"
2991,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"trouble there than in a new place."""
2992,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2993,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,So back they went again--boggart and all.
2994,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
2995,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"By this you may see, my dear, if you warm an imp by your fire, he will"
2996,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"soon turn the whole house topsy-turvy. Likewise, one cannot get rid of a"
2997,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"boggart by going from here to there, for it is sure to be in the cart"
2998,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,with the household things.
2999,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
3000,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,But how did Georgie Griggs get rid of his boggart? That I will tell you.
3001,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
3002,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"He went to Father Grimes, the wise man, who lived on in a little house"
3003,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"on the moor. ""Father Grimes,"" said he, ""how shall I get rid of my"
3004,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"boggart?"""
3005,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
3006,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Then Father Grimes told him to take this and that, and to do thus and so"
3007,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"with them, and see what followed. So Farmer Griggs went to Hugh the"
3008,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"tailor's, and told him to make a pretty red coat and a neat pair of blue"
3009,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"breeches. Then he went to William the hatter's, and bade him to make a"
3010,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,nice little velvet cap with a bell at the top of it. Then he went to
3011,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Thomas the shoemaker's, and bade him to make a fine little pair of"
3012,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"shoes. So they all did as he told them, and after these things were"
3013,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,made he took them home with him. He laid them on a warm spot on the
3014,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,hearth where the boggart used to come to sleep at night. Then he and his
3015,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,dame hid in the closet to see what would follow.
3016,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
3017,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Presently came the boggart, whisking here and dancing there, though"
3018,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,neither the farmer nor the dame could see him any more than though he
3019,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,had been a puff of wind.
3020,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
3021,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"""Heigh-ho!"" cried the boggart, ""these be fine things for sure."" So"
3022,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"saying, he tried the hat upon his head, and it fitted exactly. Then he"
3023,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"tried the coat on his shoulders, and it fitted like wax. Then he tried"
3024,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"the breeches on his legs, and they fitted as though they grew there."
3025,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Then he tried the shoes on his feet, and there never was such a fit. So"
3026,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"he was clad in all his new clothes from top to toe, whereupon he began"
3027,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,dancing until he made the ashes on the hearth spin around with him as
3028,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"though they had gone mad, and, as he danced, he sang:"
3029,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
3030,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"""Cap for the head, alas poor head!"
3031,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Coat for the back, alas poor back!"
3032,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Breeks for the legs, alas poor legs!"
3033,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Shoen for the feet, alas poor feet!"
3034,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"If these be mine, mine cannot be"
3035,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"The house of honest man, Georgie!"""
3036,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
3037,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"So he went singing and dancing, and skipping and leaping, out of the"
3038,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"house and away. As for Georgie Griggs and his dame, they never heard a"
3039,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,squeak from him afterwards.
3040,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,
3041,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Thus it was that Farmer Griggs got rid of his boggart. All I can say is,"
3042,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,that if I could get rid of mine as easily (for I have one in my own
3043,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"house), I would make him a suit of clothes of the finest silks and"
3044,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"satins, and would hang a bell of pure silver on the point of his cap."
3045,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"But, alackaday! there are no more wise men left to us, like good Father"
3046,FARMER GRIGG'S BOGGART,"Grimes, to tell one an easy way to get rid of one's boggart."

3241,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3242,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""Why not the Princess of the White Mountain?"" said the old King."
3243,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3244,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""Why not, indeed?"" said the young Prince, ""only she is too short."""
3245,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3246,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""Why not the Princess of the Blue Mountain?"" said the old King."
3247,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3248,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""Why not, indeed?"" said the young Prince, ""only she is too tall."""
3249,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,

3251,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3252,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""Why not, indeed?"" said the young Prince, ""only she is too dark."""
3253,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3254,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""Then whom will you have?"" said the old King."
3255,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3256,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""That I do not know,"" said the young Prince, ""only this: that her brow"
3257,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"shall be as white as milk, and her cheeks shall be as red as blood, and"
3258,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"her eyes shall be as blue as the skies, and her hair shall be like spun"
3259,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"gold."""
3260,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3261,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""Then go and find her!"" said the old King, in a huff, for his temper was"
3262,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"as short as chopped flax. ""And don't come back again till you've found"
3263,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"her!"" he bawled after the Prince as he went out to the door."
3264,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3265,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,So the Prince went out into the wide world to find such a maiden as he
3266,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"spoke of--whose brow was as white as milk, whose cheeks were as red as"
3267,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"blood, whose eyes were as blue as the skies, and whose hair was like"
3268,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,spun gold--and he would have to travel a long distance to find such a
3269,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"one nowadays, would he not?"
3270,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3271,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"So off he went, tramp! tramp! tramp! till his shoes were dusty and his"
3272,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,clothes were gray. Nothing was in his wallet but a lump of brown bread
3273,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"and a cold sausage, for he had gone out into the world in haste, as many"
3274,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,a one has done before and since his day.
3275,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3276,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"So he went along, tramp! tramp! tramp! and by-and-by he came to a place"
3277,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"where three roads met, and there sat an old woman."
3278,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3279,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""Hui! hui! but I am hungry!"" said the old woman."
3280,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3281,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"Now the Prince was a good-hearted fellow, so he said to the old woman,"
3282,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""It is little I have, but such as it is you are welcome to it."""
3283,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,Thereupon he gave the old woman the lump of brown bread and the cold
3284,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"sausage that was in his wallet, and the old woman ate it up at a bite."
3285,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3286,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""Hui! hui! but I am cold!"" said she."
3287,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3288,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""It is little that I have, but such as it is you are welcome to it,"""
3289,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"said the Prince, and he gave the old woman the dusty coat off his back."
3290,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,After that he had nothing more to give her.
3291,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3292,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,[Illustration: Ye King Prince John]
3293,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3294,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""One does not give something for nothing,"" said the old woman, so she"
3295,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,began fumbling about in her pocket until she found an old rusty key. And
3296,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"the best part of the key was, that whenever one looked through the ring"
3297,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"of it, one saw everything just as it really was and not as it seemed to"
3298,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,be.
3299,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3300,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,Who would not give his dinner and the coat off his back for such a key?
3301,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3302,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"After that the Prince stepped out again, right foot foremost, tramp!"
3303,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"tramp! tramp! until evening had come, and he felt as hungry as one is"
3304,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,like to do when one goes without one's dinner. At last he came to a dark
3305,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"forest, and to a gray castle that stood just in the middle of it. This"
3306,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"castle belonged to a great, ugly troll, though the Prince knew nothing"
3307,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,of that.
3308,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3309,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""Now I shall have something to eat,"" said he, and he opened the door of"
3310,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,the castle and went in.
3311,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3312,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"Only one person was within, and that was a maiden; but she was as black"
3313,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,from head to foot as Fritz the charcoal burner. The Prince had never
3314,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"seen the like of her in all of his life before, so he drew the rusty key"
3315,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"out of his pocket and took a peep at her through the ring of it, to see"
3316,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,what manner of body she really was.
3317,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3318,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"Then he saw that she was no longer black and ugly, but as beautiful as a"
3319,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"ripe apple; for her forehead was as white as milk, her cheeks were as"
3320,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"red as blood, her eyes were as blue as the skies, and her hair was like"
3321,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"spun gold. Moreover, any one could see with half an eye that she was a"
3322,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"real princess, for she wore a gold crown on her head, such as real"
3323,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,princesses are never without.
3324,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3325,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""You are the one whom I seek,"" said the Prince."
3326,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3327,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""Yes, I am the one you seek,"" said she."
3328,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3329,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""And how can I free you from your enchantment?"" said he."
3330,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3331,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""If you will abide here three nights, and will bear all that shall"
3332,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"happen to you without a word, then I shall be free,"" said she."
3333,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3334,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""Oh yes, I will do that,"" said the Prince."
3335,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3336,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"After that the black Princess set a good supper before him, and the"
3337,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,Prince ate like three men.
3338,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3339,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"By-and-by there was a huge noise, and the door opened and in came an"
3340,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,ugly troll with a head as big as a bucket. He rolled his great saucer
3341,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,eyes around till he saw the Prince where he sat beside the fire.
3342,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3343,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,[Illustration: The Prince aids the Old Woman]
3344,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3345,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""Black cats and spotted toads!"" bellowed he, ""what are you doing here?"""
3346,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3347,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,But to this the Prince answered never a word.
3348,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3349,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""We shall see whether or no there is sound in you!"" roared the troll."
3350,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,Thereupon he caught the Prince by the hair and dragged him out into the
3351,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,middle of the room. Then he snatched up a great cudgel and began beating
3352,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,the Prince as though he were a sack of barley-flour; but the Prince said
3353,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"never a word. At last the troll had to give over beating him, for the"
3354,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,morning had come and the troll was afraid the sun would catch him; and
3355,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"if that were to happen, he would swell up and burst with a great noise."
3356,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""We shall see whether you will come again!"" said he, and then he left"
3357,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,the Prince lying on the floor more dead than alive; and if anybody was
3358,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"sore in all of the world, the Prince was that man."
3359,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3360,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"After the troll had left the house, the black Princess came and wept"
3361,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"over the Prince; and when her tears fell on him, pain and bruise left"
3362,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"him, and he was as whole as ever. When he looked he saw that the black"
3363,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,Princess's feet were as white as silver.
3364,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3365,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"The next night the troll came again, and with him two others. ""Black"
3366,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"cats and spotted toads!"" bellowed he, ""are you here again?"" Then he"
3367,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,caught the Prince by the hair and dragged him out into the middle of the
3368,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"floor, and all three of the trolls fell upon the Prince and beat him"
3369,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"with clubs, as though he had been a sack of barley-flour. But the Prince"
3370,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"bore this too without a word. At last the morning came, and they had to"
3371,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"give over beating him. ""We shall see if you will come again,"" said the"
3372,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,troll of the house.
3373,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3374,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"After the trolls had gone, the black Princess came and wept over the"
3375,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"Prince as she had done before, and when her tears fell on him he was"
3376,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,made whole again. And now the hands of the black Princess were as white
3377,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,as silver.
3378,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3379,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,[Illustration: THE GREAT UGLY TROLL FINDS THE PRINCE BY THE FIRE]
3380,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3381,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"The third night the troll of the house came, and brought with him six"
3382,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"others. Then the same thing happened as before, and they beat the Prince"
3383,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"with great cudgels as thick as my thumb. At last the morning came, and"
3384,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"they went away bellowing and howling, for their enchantment had gone. As"
3385,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"for the Prince, he lay upon the floor more dead than alive, for he could"
3386,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,neither see nor hear anything that happened about him.
3387,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3388,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"Then the Princess came for the third time and wept over him, and he was"
3389,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"whole and sound again. As for the Princess, she stood before him, and"
3390,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"now her brow was as white as milk, and her cheeks were as red as blood,"
3391,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"and her eyes were as blue as the skies, and her hair was like spun gold."
3392,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"But the beautiful Princess had little or nothing upon her, so the Prince"
3393,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,wrapped her in a ram's skin that was in the troll's house. Then he
3394,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"turned his toes the way he had come, and started away for home, taking"
3395,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,her along with him.
3396,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3397,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,So they went along and along till they had come so near to the King's
3398,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,house that they could see the high roofs and the weathercocks over the
3399,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,crest of the next hill. There the Prince bade the Princess to wait for
3400,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"him till he went home and brought her a dress of real silver and gold,"
3401,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"such as was fitting for her to wear. Then he left her, and the Princess"
3402,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,sat down beside the roadside to wait until he should come again.
3403,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3404,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"Now as the Princess sat there, there came along the old goose-herd of"
3405,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"the palace, and with her came her daughter; for they were driving the"
3406,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,royal geese home again from where they had been eating grass. When they
3407,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"saw the beautiful Princess, clad in her ram's hide, they stared as"
3408,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,though they would never shut their eyes again. Then they wanted to know
3409,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"all about her--who she was, and where she came from, and what she sat"
3410,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"there for. So the Princess told them all that they wanted to know, and"
3411,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,that she waited there for the Prince to come with a dress all of silver
3412,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"and gold, which would suit her better than the old ram's hide which she"
3413,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,wore.
3414,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3415,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,Then the old goose-woman thought that it would be a fine thing to have
3416,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"her daughter in the Princess's place, so that she might have the dress"
3417,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"of real silver and gold, and marry the Prince. So the goose-herd's"
3418,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"daughter held the Princess, and the old goose-herd stripped the ram's"
3419,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,hide off from her.
3420,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3421,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,No sooner had they done this than the Princess was changed into a
3422,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"beautiful golden bird, and flew away over hill and over valley. Then the"
3423,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"goose-herd's daughter clad herself in the ram's hide, and sat down in"
3424,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,the Princess's place.
3425,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3426,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,[Illustration: The Gooseherd & her Daughter meet the Princess at the

3428,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3429,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""Yes, my pretty little bird,"" said the old goose-herd, ""thou wilt make a"
3430,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"fine Princess!"" But, prut! she was no more like a Princess than I am,"
3431,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"for she was squat, and round-shouldered, and had hair of the color of"
3432,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,tow.
3433,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3434,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"Then the old goose-herd drove her geese away, and the goose-girl waited"
3435,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,for the coming of the Prince.
3436,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3437,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"Sure enough, after a while the Prince came with a fine dress, all of"
3438,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,real silver and gold; but when he saw the goose-girl he beat his head
3439,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"with his knuckles, for he thought that it was the Princess, and that she"
3440,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,was enchanted again.
3441,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3442,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,Why did he not look through the ring of his magic key?
3443,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3444,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"Perhaps for this, perhaps for that--one cannot be always wise."
3445,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3446,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,[Illustration: The Prince looks through the Magic Key.]
3447,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3448,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,Then the Prince dressed the goose-girl in the fine dress of gold and
3449,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"silver, and took her home with him. Hui! how everybody stared and"
3450,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,laughed when they saw what kind of a Princess it was that the Prince
3451,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"brought home with him! As for the poor old King, he rubbed his"
3452,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"spectacles and looked and looked, for he thought that this was a strange"
3453,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"sort of a wife for the Prince to make such a buzz about. However, he"
3454,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"said nothing, for he thought to himself that perhaps she would grow"
3455,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,prettier by-and-by.
3456,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3457,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"So orders were given for a grand wedding on Thursday, and the old King"
3458,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"asked all of the neighbors to come, and even those who lived at a"
3459,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"distance, for this was to be a very grand wedding indeed."
3460,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3461,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,But the old goose-herd told her daughter to mix a sleeping powder with
3462,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"the Prince's wine at supper, for, if the real Princess were to come at"
3463,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"all, she would come that night. So the goose-girl did as she was told,"
3464,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"and the Prince drank the sleeping powder with his wine, and knew nothing"
3465,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,of it.
3466,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3467,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"That night the golden bird came flying, and sat in the linden tree just"
3468,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,outside of the Prince's chamber window. Then she clapped her wings and
3469,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,sang:
3470,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3471,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""I wept over you once,"
3472,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"I wept over you twice,"
3473,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,I wept over you three times.
3474,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"In the ram's skin I waited,"
3475,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,And out of the ram's skin I flew.
3476,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"Why are you sleeping,"
3477,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"Life of my life?"""
3478,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3479,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"But the Prince slept as sound as a dormouse, and when the dawn came and"
3480,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,the cocks crew the golden bird was forced to fly away.
3481,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3482,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"The next night the false Princess did as she had done before, and mixed"
3483,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,a sleeping powder with the Prince's cup of wine.
3484,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3485,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"That night the golden bird came again, and perched in the linden tree"
3486,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"outside of the Prince's window, and sang:"
3487,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3488,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""I wept over you once,"
3489,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"I wept over you twice,"
3490,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,I wept over you three times.
3491,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"In the ram's skin I waited,"
3492,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,And out of the ram's skin I flew.
3493,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"Why are you sleeping,"
3494,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"Life of my life?"""
3495,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3496,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"But once more the Prince slept through it all, and when morning had come"
3497,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,the golden bird was forced to fly away.
3498,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3499,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,Now it chanced that that night some of the folk of the King's household
3500,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"heard the bird singing, and they told the Prince all about it. So when"
3501,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"the third night came, and the false Princess gave the Prince the cup of"
3502,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"wine with the sleeping powder in it, he threw the wine over his"
3503,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"shoulder, and never touched so much as a drop of it."
3504,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3505,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"That night the bird came for the third time, and sang as it had done"
3506,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,before.
3507,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3508,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,But this time the Prince was not sleeping. He jumped out of his bed and
3509,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"ran to the window, and there he saw the bird, and its feathers shone"
3510,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,like fire because they were of pure gold. Then he got his magic key and
3511,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"looked through the ring of it, and whom should he see but his own"
3512,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,Princess sitting in the linden tree.
3513,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3514,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"Then the Prince called to her, ""What shall I do to set you free from"
3515,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"this enchantment?"""
3516,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3517,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""Throw your knife over me,"" said the Princess."
3518,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3519,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"No sooner said than done. The Prince threw his knife over her, and"
3520,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,there she stood in her own true shape. Then the Prince took her to the
3521,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"King, and when the King saw how pretty she was, he skipped and danced"
3522,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,till his slippers flew about his ears.
3523,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3524,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"The next morning the old King went to the false Princess, and said,"
3525,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""What should be done to one who would do thus and so?"""
3526,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3527,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,[Illustration: The Old King Rejoices at His New Daughter-in-Law.]
3528,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3529,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"To this the false Princess answered, as bold as brass, ""Such a one"

3531,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3532,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"""You have spoken for yourself,"" said the King; and he would have done"
3533,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,just so to her had not the true Princess begged for her so that she was
3534,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"sent back again to tend the geese, for that was what she was fit for."
3535,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3536,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,Then they had the grandest wedding that ever was seen in all of the
3537,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"world. Everybody was asked, and there was enough for all to eat as much"
3538,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"as they chose, and to take a little something home to the children"
3539,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,beside. If I had been there I would have brought you something.
3540,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,
3541,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,What is the meaning of all this?
3542,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"Listen, I will tell you something."
3543,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"Once there was a man, and he winnowed a whole"
3544,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"peck of chaff, and got only three good solid grains from"
3545,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,"it, and yet he was glad to have so much."
3546,THE BIRD IN THE LINDEN TREE,Would you winnow a whole peck of chaff for only

3651,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"There was a woman once, and she had three daughters. The first daughter"
3652,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"squinted with both eyes, yet the woman loved her as she loved salt, for"
3653,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,she herself squinted with both eyes. The second daughter had one
3654,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"shoulder higher than the other, and eyebrows as black as soot in the"
3655,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"chimney, yet the woman loved her as well as she loved the other, for she"
3656,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,herself had black eyebrows and one shoulder higher than the other. The
3657,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"youngest daughter was as pretty as a ripe apple, and had hair as fine as"
3658,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"silk and the color of pure gold, but the woman loved her not at all,"
3659,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"for, as I have said, she herself was neither pretty, nor had she hair of"
3660,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"the color of pure gold. Why all this was so, even Hans Pfifendrummel"
3661,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"cannot tell, though he has read many books and one over."
3662,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3663,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,The first sister and the second sister dressed in their Sunday clothes
3664,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"every day, and sat in the sun doing nothing, just as though they had"
3665,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"been born ladies, both of them."
3666,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3667,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,As for Christine--that was the name of the youngest girl--as for
3668,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"Christine, she dressed in nothing but rags, and had to drive the geese"
3669,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"to the hills in the morning and home again in the evening, so that they"
3670,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,might feed on the young grass all day and grow fat.
3671,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3672,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,The first sister and the second sister had white bread (and butter
3673,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,beside) and as much fresh milk as they could drink; but Christine had to
3674,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"eat cheese-parings and bread-crusts, and had hardly enough of them to"
3675,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,keep Goodman Hunger from whispering in her ear.
3676,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3677,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,This was how the churn clacked in that house!
3678,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3679,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"Well, one morning Christine started off to the hills with her flock of"
3680,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"geese, and in her hands she carried her knitting, at which she worked to"
3681,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"save time. So she went along the dusty road until, by-and-by, she came"
3682,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"to a place where a bridge crossed the brook, and what should she see"
3683,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"there but a little red cap, with a silver bell at the point of it,"
3684,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"hanging from the alder branch. It was such a nice, pretty little red cap"
3685,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"that Christine thought that she would take it home with her, for she had"
3686,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,never seen the like of it in all of her life before.
3687,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3688,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"So she put it in her pocket, and then off she went with her geese again."
3689,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,But she had hardly gone two-score of paces when she heard a voice
3690,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"calling her, ""Christine! Christine!"""
3691,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3692,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"She looked, and who should she see but a queer little gray man, with a"
3693,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,great head as big as a cabbage and little legs as thin as young
3694,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,radishes.
3695,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3696,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"""What do you want?"" said Christine, when the little man had come to"
3697,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,where she was.
3698,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3699,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"Oh, the little man only wanted his cap again, for without it he could"
3700,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,not go back home into the hill--that was where he belonged.
3701,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3702,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"But how did the cap come to be hanging from the bush? Yes, Christine"
3703,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,would like to know that before she gave it back again.
3704,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3705,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,[Illustration: The little man asks far his cap.]
3706,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3707,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"Well, the little hill-man was fishing by the brook over yonder when a"
3708,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"puff of wind blew his cap into the water, and he just hung it up to dry."
3709,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,That was all that there was about it; and now would Christine please
3710,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,give it to him?
3711,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3712,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,Christine did not know how about that; perhaps she would and perhaps she
3713,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"would not. It was a nice, pretty little cap; what would the little"
3714,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,underground man give her for it? that was the question.
3715,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3716,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"Oh, the little man would give her five thalers for it, and gladly."
3717,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3718,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"No; five thalers was not enough for such a pretty little cap--see, there"
3719,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,was a silver bell hanging to it too.
3720,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3721,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"Well, the little man did not want to be hard at a bargain; he would give"
3722,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,her a hundred thalers for it.
3723,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3724,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,No; Christine did not care for money. What else would he give for this
3725,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"nice, dear little cap?"
3726,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3727,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"""See, Christine,"" said the little man, ""I will give you this for the"
3728,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"cap""; and he showed her something in his hand that looked just like a"
3729,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"bean, only it was as black as a lump of coal."
3730,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3731,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"""Yes, good; but what is that?"" said Christine."
3732,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3733,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"""That,"" said the little man, ""is a seed from the apple of contentment."
3734,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"Plant it, and from it will grow a tree, and from the tree an apple."
3735,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"Everybody in the world that sees the apple will long for it, but nobody"
3736,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,in the world can pluck it but you. It will always be meat and drink to
3737,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"you when you are hungry, and warm clothes to your back when you are"
3738,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"cold. Moreover, as soon as you pluck it from the tree, another as good"
3739,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"will grow in its place. _Now_, will you give me my hat?"""
3740,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3741,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,Oh yes; Christine would give the little man his cap for such a seed as
3742,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"that, and gladly enough. So the little man gave Christine the seed, and"
3743,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"Christine gave the little man his cap again. He put the cap on his head,"
3744,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"and--puff!--away he was gone, as suddenly as the light of a candle when"
3745,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,you blow it out.
3746,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3747,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"So Christine took the seed home with her, and planted it before the"
3748,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,window of her room. The next morning when she looked out of the window
3749,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"she beheld a beautiful tree, and on the tree hung an apple that shone"
3750,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,in the sun as though it were pure gold. Then she went to the tree and
3751,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"plucked the apple as easily as though it were a gooseberry, and as soon"
3752,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,as she had plucked it another as good grew in its place. Being hungry
3753,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"she ate it, and thought that she had never eaten anything as good, for"
3754,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,it tasted like pancake with honey and milk.
3755,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3756,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,[Illustration: Christine and the Apple]
3757,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3758,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"By-and-by the oldest sister came out of the house and looked around, but"
3759,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,when she saw the beautiful tree with the golden apple hanging from it
3760,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,you can guess how she stared.
3761,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3762,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,Presently she began to long and long for the apple as she had never
3763,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"longed for anything in her life. ""I will just pluck it,"" said she, ""and"
3764,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"no one will be the wiser for it."" But that was easier said than done."
3765,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"She reached and reached, but she might as well have reached for the"
3766,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"moon; she climbed and climbed, but she might as well have climbed for"
3767,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,the sun--for either one would have been as easy to get as that which she
3768,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"wanted. At last she had to give up trying for it, and her temper was"
3769,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"none the sweeter for that, you may be sure."
3770,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3771,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,[Illustration: Christine's Mother and Sisters wish for the Apple.]
3772,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3773,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"After a while came the second sister, and when she saw the golden apple"
3774,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,she wanted it just as much as the first had done. But to want and to get
3775,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"are very different things, as she soon found, for she was no more able"
3776,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,to get it than the other had been.
3777,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3778,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"Last of all came the mother, and she also strove to pluck the apple. But"
3779,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,it was no use. She had no more luck of her trying than her daughters;
3780,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,all that the three could do was to stand under the tree and look at the
3781,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"apple, and wish for it and wish for it."
3782,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3783,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"They are not the only ones who have done the like, with the apple of"
3784,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,contentment hanging just above them.
3785,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,
3786,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"As for Christine, she had nothing to do but to pluck an apple whenever"
3787,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,she wanted it. Was she hungry? there was the apple hanging in the tree
3788,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,for her. Was she thirsty? there was the apple. Cold? there was the
3789,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"apple. So you see, she was the happiest girl betwixt all the seven hills"
3790,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,that stand at the ends of the earth; for nobody in the world can have
3791,THE APPLE OF CONTENTMENT,"more than contentment, and that was what the apple brought her."

3798,II,desire came upon him to have a taste of it. So he called one of the
3799,II,"servants to him, and told him to go and ask whether it could be bought"
3800,II,for a potful of gold.
3801,II,
3802,II,"So the servant went to the house, and knocked on the door--rap! tap!"
3803,II,tap!
3804,II,
3805,II,"""What do you want?"" said the mother of the three sisters, coming to the"

3807,II,
3808,II,"Oh, nothing much; only a king was out there in the road, and wanted to"

3810,II,
3811,II,"Yes, the woman would do that. Just pay her the pot of gold and he might"
3812,II,go and pluck it and welcome.
3813,II,
3814,II,"So the servant gave her the pot of gold, and then he tried to pluck the"
3815,II,"apple. First he reached for it, and then he climbed for it, and then he"
3816,II,shook the limb.
3817,II,
3818,II,But it was no use for him to try; he could no more get it--well--than
3819,II,_I_ could if I had been in his place.
3820,II,
3821,II,"At last the servant had to go back to the King. The apple was there, he"
3822,II,"said, and the woman had sold it, but try and try as he would he could no"
3823,II,more get it than he could get the little stars in the sky.
3824,II,
3825,II,Then the King told the steward to go and get it for him; but the
3826,II,"steward, though he was a tall man and a strong man, could no more pluck"
3827,II,the apple than the servant.
3828,II,
3829,II,[Illustration: The King reaches for the Apple]
3830,II,
3831,II,So he had to go back to the King with an empty fist. No; he could not
3832,II,"gather it, either."
3833,II,
3834,II,Then the King himself went. He knew that he could pluck it--of course he
3835,II,"could! Well, he tried and tried; but nothing came of his trying, and he"
3836,II,"had to ride away at last without, having had so much as a smell of the"
3837,II,apple.
3838,II,
3839,II,"After the King came home, he talked and dreamed and thought of nothing"
3840,II,but the apple; for the more he could not get it the more he wanted
3841,II,it--that is the way we are made in this world. At last he grew
3842,II,melancholy and sick for want of that which he could not get. Then he
3843,II,sent for one who was so wise that he had more in his head than ten men
3844,II,together. This wise man told him that the only one who could pluck the
3845,II,fruit of contentment for him was the one to whom the tree belonged.
3846,II,This was one of the daughters of the woman who had sold the apple to him
3847,II,for the pot of gold.
3848,II,
3849,II,"When the King heard this he was very glad; he had his horse saddled, and"
3850,II,"he and his court rode away, and so came at last to the cottage where"
3851,II,"Christine lived. There they found the mother and the elder sisters, for"
3852,II,Christine was away on the hills with her geese.
3853,II,
3854,II,The King took off his hat and made a fine bow.
3855,II,
3856,II,The wise man at home had told him this and that; now to which one of her
3857,II,daughters did the apple-tree belong? so said the King.
3858,II,
3859,II,"""Oh, it is my oldest daughter who owns the tree,"" said the woman."
3860,II,
3861,II,"So, good! Then if the oldest daughter would pluck the apple for him he"
3862,II,would take her home and marry her and make a queen of her. Only let her
3863,II,get it for him without delay.
3864,II,
3865,II,Prut! that would never do. What! was the girl to climb the apple-tree
3866,II,"before the King and all of the court? No! no! Let the King go home, and"
3867,II,she would bring the apple to him all in good time; that was what the
3868,II,woman said.
3869,II,
3870,II,"Well, the King would do that, only let her make haste, for he wanted it"
3871,II,very much indeed.
3872,II,
3873,II,"As soon as the King had gone, the woman and her daughters sent for the"
3874,II,goose-girl to the hills. Then they told her that the King wanted the
3875,II,"apple yonder, and that she must pluck it for her sister to take to him;"
3876,II,if she did not do as they said they would throw her into the well. So
3877,II,Christine had to pluck the fruit; and as soon as she had done so the
3878,II,oldest sister wrapped it up in a napkin and set off with it to the
3879,II,"King's house, as pleased as pleased could be. Rap! tap! tap! she knocked"
3880,II,at the door. Had she brought the apple for the King?
3881,II,
3882,II,"Oh yes, she had brought it. Here it was, all wrapped up in a fine"
3883,II,napkin.
3884,II,
3885,II,[Illustration: The King talks with the Wise Man:]
3886,II,
3887,II,After that they did not let her stand outside the door till her toes
3888,II,"were cold, I can tell you. As soon as she had come to the King she"
3889,II,"opened her napkin. Believe me or not as you please, all the same, I tell"
3890,II,you that there was nothing in the napkin but a hard round stone. When
3891,II,the King saw only a stone he was so angry that he stamped like a rabbit
3892,II,"and told them to put the girl out of the house. So they did, and she"
3893,II,"went home with a flea in her ear, I can tell you."
3894,II,
3895,II,Then the King sent his steward to the house where Christine and her
3896,II,sisters lived.
3897,II,
3898,II,He told the woman that he had come to find whether she had any other
3899,II,daughters.
3900,II,
3901,II,[Illustration: The Kings Steward and Christine.]
3902,II,
3903,II,"Yes; the woman had another daughter, and, to tell the truth, it was she"
3904,II,who owned the tree. Just let the steward go home again and the girl
3905,II,would fetch the apple in a little while.
3906,II,
3907,II,"As soon as the steward had gone, they sent to the hills for Christine"
3908,II,again. Look! she must pluck the apple for the second sister to take to
3909,II,the King; if she did not do that they would throw her into the well.
3910,II,
3911,II,"So Christine had to pluck it, and gave it to the second sister, who"
3912,II,wrapped it up in a napkin and set off for the King's house. But she
3913,II,"fared no better than the other, for, when she opened the napkin, there"
3914,II,was nothing in it but a lump of mud. So they packed her home again with
3915,II,her apron to her eyes.
3916,II,
3917,II,[Illustration: Christine gives the Apple to the King]
3918,II,
3919,II,After a while the King's steward came to the house again. Had the woman
3920,II,no other daughter than these two?
3921,II,
3922,II,"Well, yes, there was one, but she was a poor ragged thing, of no"
3923,II,"account, and fit for nothing in the world but to tend the geese."
3924,II,
3925,II,Where was she?
3926,II,
3927,II,"Oh, she was up on the hills now tending her flock."
3928,II,
3929,II,But could the steward see her?
3930,II,
3931,II,"Yes, he might see her, but she was nothing but a poor simpleton."
3932,II,
3933,II,"That was all very good, but the steward would like to see her, for that"
3934,II,was what the King had sent him there for.
3935,II,
3936,II,So there was nothing to do but to send to the hills for Christine.
3937,II,
3938,II,"After a while she came, and the steward asked her if she could pluck the"
3939,II,apple yonder for the King.
3940,II,
3941,II,Yes; Christine could do that easily enough. So she reached and picked it
3942,II,as though it had been nothing but a gooseberry on the bush. Then the
3943,II,steward took off his hat and made her a low bow in spite of her ragged
3944,II,"dress, for he saw that she was the one for whom they had been looking"
3945,II,all this time.
3946,II,
3947,II,"So Christine slipped the golden apple into her pocket, and then she and"
3948,II,the steward set off to the King's house together.
3949,II,
3950,II,When they had come there everybody began to titter and laugh behind the
3951,II,palms of their hands to see what a poor ragged goose-girl the steward
3952,II,had brought home with him. But for that the steward cared not a rap.
3953,II,
3954,II,"""Have you brought the apple?"" said the King, as soon as Christine had"
3955,II,come before him.
3956,II,
3957,II,Yes; here it was; and Christine thrust her hand into her pocket and
3958,II,"brought it forth. Then the King took a great bite of it, and as soon as"
3959,II,he had done so he looked at Christine and thought that he had never seen
3960,II,"such a pretty girl. As for her rags, he minded them no more than one"
3961,II,minds the spots on a cherry; that was because he had eaten of the apple
3962,II,of contentment.
3963,II,
3964,II,"And were they married? Of course they were! and a grand wedding it was,"
3965,II,I can tell you. It is a pity that you were not there; but though you
3966,II,"were not, Christine's mother and sisters were, and, what is more, they"
3967,II,"danced with the others, though I believe they would rather have danced"
3968,II,upon pins and needles.
3969,II,
3970,II,"""Never mind,"" said they; ""we still have the apple of contentment at"
3971,II,"home, though we cannot taste of it."" But no; they had nothing of the"
3972,II,kind. The next morning it stood before the young Queen Christine's
3973,II,"window, just as it had at her old home, for it belonged to her and to no"
3974,II,"one else in all of the world. That was lucky for the King, for he needed"
3975,II,"a taste of it now and then as much as anybody else, and no one could"
3976,II,pluck it for him but Christine.
3977,II,
3978,II,"Now, that is all of this story. What does it"
3979,II,mean? Can you not see? Prut! rub
3980,II,your spectacles and look again!
3981,II,
3982,II,
