97,THE CHANGED CROSS,A Thrilling Experience
98,THE CHANGED CROSS,
99,THE CHANGED CROSS,MIGHT vs. RIGHT
100,THE CHANGED CROSS,
101,THE CHANGED CROSS,
102,THE CHANGED CROSS,"It is some years since I was station-master, telegraph-operator,"
103,THE CHANGED CROSS,baggage-agent and ticket seller at a little village near some valuable
104,THE CHANGED CROSS,oil wells.
105,THE CHANGED CROSS,
106,THE CHANGED CROSS,The station-house was a little distance from the unpretentious
107,THE CHANGED CROSS,"thoroughfare that had grown up in a day, and my duties were so arduous"
108,THE CHANGED CROSS,that I had scarcely leisure for a weekly flitting to a certain mansion
109,THE CHANGED CROSS,"on the hill where dwelt Ellen Morris, my promised wife. In fact, it was"
110,THE CHANGED CROSS,with the hope of lessening the distance between us that I had under
111,THE CHANGED CROSS,taken these quadruple duties.
112,THE CHANGED CROSS,
113,THE CHANGED CROSS,"The day was gloomy, and towards the afternoon ominous rolls of thunder"
114,THE CHANGED CROSS,portended a storm.
115,THE CHANGED CROSS,
116,THE CHANGED CROSS,"Colonel Holloway, the well-known treasurer of the oil company, had been"
117,THE CHANGED CROSS,in the village several days. About one o'clock he came hurriedly into
118,THE CHANGED CROSS,"the office with a package, which he laid upon my desk, saying:"
119,THE CHANGED CROSS,
120,THE CHANGED CROSS,"""Take care of that, Bowen, till to-morrow. I am going up the road."""
121,THE CHANGED CROSS,
122,THE CHANGED CROSS,"The commission was not an unusual one, and my safe was one of Marvin's"
123,THE CHANGED CROSS,"best. I counted the money, which footed up into the thousands, placed"
124,THE CHANGED CROSS,"it in the official envelope, affixed the seals, and deposited it in the"
125,THE CHANGED CROSS,"safe. As I turned away from the lock, a voice at the door said:"
126,THE CHANGED CROSS,
127,THE CHANGED CROSS,"""Say, mister, can you tell me the way to the post office?"""
128,THE CHANGED CROSS,
129,THE CHANGED CROSS,A sort of shock went through me at the unexpected presence that seemed
130,THE CHANGED CROSS,"to have dropped down from nowhere, and I replied irritably:"
131,THE CHANGED CROSS,
132,THE CHANGED CROSS,"""You could not miss it if you tried. Keep straight ahead."""
133,THE CHANGED CROSS,
134,THE CHANGED CROSS,"Soon large drops of rain came down, then faster and more furiously, till"
135,THE CHANGED CROSS,"the air was one vast sheet of water, and little rivers leaped madly"
136,THE CHANGED CROSS,along the gullies and culverts. Forked lightning kept pace with the
137,THE CHANGED CROSS,"pealing thunder, and heaven's own artillery seemed let loose."
138,THE CHANGED CROSS,
139,THE CHANGED CROSS,"Anything more dismal or dreary could not well be imagined, and gradually"
140,THE CHANGED CROSS,the loneliness grew very oppressive. Every straggler had fled to
141,THE CHANGED CROSS,"shelter, and the usual idlers had deserted the platform."
142,THE CHANGED CROSS,
143,THE CHANGED CROSS,"But I resolutely set to work at the dry statistics of the station-books,"
144,THE CHANGED CROSS,"with an occasional call to the wires, which were ticking like mad, so"
145,THE CHANGED CROSS,fierce was the electric current.
146,THE CHANGED CROSS,
147,THE CHANGED CROSS,"It was near five o'clock when a long freight train came lumbering by,"
148,THE CHANGED CROSS,"switched off a car or two, then dragged its slow length onward. This"
149,THE CHANGED CROSS,"created a brief diversion, then once more I was deserted."
150,THE CHANGED CROSS,
151,THE CHANGED CROSS,The next passenger train was not due till ten o'clock. I lit the lamps
152,THE CHANGED CROSS,and resigned myself with questionable patience to the intervening hours.
153,THE CHANGED CROSS,"An agreeable interruption came in the form of my supper, which was"
154,THE CHANGED CROSS,brought in a water-proof basket by a sort of jack-at-all-trades whom we
155,THE CHANGED CROSS,"called Jake. Shaking himself like a great dog, he ""lowed there wa'n't"
156,THE CHANGED CROSS,"much more water up yonder nohow."""
157,THE CHANGED CROSS,
158,THE CHANGED CROSS,"""I hope not, indeed,"" I said, glad of the sound of a human voice."
159,THE CHANGED CROSS,"""Jake!"" I called, as he left the office, ""come back as soon as you"
160,THE CHANGED CROSS,"can--I may need you."""
161,THE CHANGED CROSS,
162,THE CHANGED CROSS,I had a vague idea of despatching some sort of report to Ellen that I
163,THE CHANGED CROSS,"had not been entirely washed away, and obtaining a similar comfort as"
164,THE CHANGED CROSS,to her own fate. I little thought how I should need him.
165,THE CHANGED CROSS,
166,THE CHANGED CROSS,"I think I am not by nature more timid than other men, but as the dismal"
167,THE CHANGED CROSS,evening closed in I took from my desk two revolvers kept ready for
168,THE CHANGED CROSS,"possible emergencies, and laid one upon the desk where I was making"
169,THE CHANGED CROSS,freight entries and the other on the table where the electric battery
170,THE CHANGED CROSS,stood. At intervals a fresh package for the night express was brought
171,THE CHANGED CROSS,"by some dripping carrier, who deposited it, got his receipt, hung about"
172,THE CHANGED CROSS,"for a few minutes, then hastened away to more comfortable quarters."
173,THE CHANGED CROSS,
174,THE CHANGED CROSS,Still the rain poured in torrents. It must have been nearly nine o'clock
175,THE CHANGED CROSS,"when a wagon, hurriedly driven, pulled up suddenly at the platform. In a"
176,THE CHANGED CROSS,"moment the door was flung open, and I saw a small ambulance well known"
177,THE CHANGED CROSS,"about the village. Two men sprang out, and with the help of the driver"
178,THE CHANGED CROSS,"and his assistant, proceeded to lift out a box which from its dimensions"
179,THE CHANGED CROSS,"could contain only one kind of freight, to wit, the remains of a human"
180,THE CHANGED CROSS,being.
181,THE CHANGED CROSS,
182,THE CHANGED CROSS,"Carefully placing this box in a remote corner of the room, near other"
183,THE CHANGED CROSS,"boxes awaiting transportation, the driver and his man returned to their"
184,THE CHANGED CROSS,"wagon, while the two strangers approached the desk to enter their"
185,THE CHANGED CROSS,ghastly freight. They wore slouched hats and were very wet. They
186,THE CHANGED CROSS,"produced a death certificate of one John Slate, who had died at a farm"
187,THE CHANGED CROSS,"house several miles away, of a non-contagious complaint, and was to be"
188,THE CHANGED CROSS,shipped to his friends down the road. This was all. There was nothing
189,THE CHANGED CROSS,"singular about it, and yet when the door closed upon the strangers and"
190,THE CHANGED CROSS,"I was again alone, or worse than alone a feeling of awe came over me."
191,THE CHANGED CROSS,Clearly the storm had somewhat unstrung me.
192,THE CHANGED CROSS,
193,THE CHANGED CROSS,"Only one hour till the train was due, after which I could turn in for"
194,THE CHANGED CROSS,the night.
195,THE CHANGED CROSS,
196,THE CHANGED CROSS,"A louder peal of thunder shook the house, and fiercer flashed the"
197,THE CHANGED CROSS,"lightning. Minute after minute went by, and each seemed an age. The"
198,THE CHANGED CROSS,"roar and din of the elements only deepened the gloom inside, where the"
199,THE CHANGED CROSS,uncertain kerosene lamp darkened the shadows.
200,THE CHANGED CROSS,
201,THE CHANGED CROSS,Suddenly to my overstrained nerves the ceaseless clicking of the
202,THE CHANGED CROSS,"instrument seemed to say, ""Watch the box--watch the box--watch the box."""
203,THE CHANGED CROSS,As a particular strain of melody will at times repeat itself in the
204,THE CHANGED CROSS,"mind, and obstinately keep time to every movement, till one is well-nigh"
205,THE CHANGED CROSS,"distracted, so this refrain began to enchain every sense: ""Watch the"
206,THE CHANGED CROSS,"box--watch the box--watch the box."" Till now my depressed spirits were"
207,THE CHANGED CROSS,due only to the solitude and the storm. No suspicion of evil or danger
208,THE CHANGED CROSS,had tormented me.
209,THE CHANGED CROSS,
210,THE CHANGED CROSS,"Peering more closely into the dingy corner, I saw only the ordinary pine"
211,THE CHANGED CROSS,"box, with what seemed to be a square paper, or placard, on the side"
212,THE CHANGED CROSS,"facing me. Probably the address, bunglingly adjusted on the side instead"
213,THE CHANGED CROSS,"of the top, or else a stain of mud from the late rough drive. At all"
214,THE CHANGED CROSS,events I was not curious enough to approach more nearly the ghostly
215,THE CHANGED CROSS,visitant.
216,THE CHANGED CROSS,
217,THE CHANGED CROSS,"Ten minutes had crept by, when a muffled noise in the dark corner"
218,THE CHANGED CROSS,"distinctly sounded above the pelting raindrops, while as if to mock at"
219,THE CHANGED CROSS,"my quickened fears, the wires continued their monotonous warning,"
220,THE CHANGED CROSS,"""Watch the box--watch the box--watch the box."" I did watch the box, and"
221,THE CHANGED CROSS,now as if by inspiration I grasped the situation. There was indeed a man
222,THE CHANGED CROSS,"in the box, but not a dead one. A living man who had boldly lent himself"
223,THE CHANGED CROSS,"to a plot to rob or murder me, or perhaps both."
224,THE CHANGED CROSS,
225,THE CHANGED CROSS,"I remembered the straggler who had surprised me while at the safe,"
226,THE CHANGED CROSS,several hours before. He had doubtless followed Col. Holloway and
227,THE CHANGED CROSS,witnessed the money transaction. Quick and fast flew my thoughts in the
228,THE CHANGED CROSS,startled endeavor to grasp some plan of action. Single-handed I was no
229,THE CHANGED CROSS,"match for any man, having recently recovered from an attack of malarial"
230,THE CHANGED CROSS,fever. This one in the box (if indeed there was one) must mean to secure
231,THE CHANGED CROSS,"the prize before the train was due, and escape the consequences. He must"
232,THE CHANGED CROSS,"have accomplices, and these were doubtless on watch, either to give or"
233,THE CHANGED CROSS,receive a signal. At least it was not probable that he would undertake
234,THE CHANGED CROSS,"the job alone, and the fact that he had confederates had already"
235,THE CHANGED CROSS,appeared.
236,THE CHANGED CROSS,
237,THE CHANGED CROSS,Perhaps the sight of my pistol had delayed the attack. Perhaps some part
238,THE CHANGED CROSS,of their plan had miscarried and caused delay. At all events I must be
239,THE CHANGED CROSS,cool. I fancied I saw his eyes through the dark patch on the box. I was
240,THE CHANGED CROSS,"almost sure he was slowly lifting the lid. There was no help near, and"
241,THE CHANGED CROSS,much might be done in the time still to elapse before the train was due.
242,THE CHANGED CROSS,
243,THE CHANGED CROSS,"Quietly walking to the battery, I feigned to take a message. In reality"
244,THE CHANGED CROSS,"I sent one to the conductor of the on-coming express, as the only device"
245,THE CHANGED CROSS,"whereby I could secure assistance, and this would doubtless come too"
246,THE CHANGED CROSS,late. Yet it was all I could do just now.
247,THE CHANGED CROSS,
248,THE CHANGED CROSS,"With every sense on the alert I arose to secrete my key if possible,"
249,THE CHANGED CROSS,"when the door burst open, and Frank Morris, my future brother-in-law,"
250,THE CHANGED CROSS,"rushed in, followed by a huge dog that was Ellen's special pet and"
251,THE CHANGED CROSS,attendant.
252,THE CHANGED CROSS,
253,THE CHANGED CROSS,"""Confound you!"" said Frank, spluttering about and shaking himself as"
254,THE CHANGED CROSS,"vigorously as the dog. ""I'll be blowed if I ever go on such a fool's"
255,THE CHANGED CROSS,"errand as this."""
256,THE CHANGED CROSS,
257,THE CHANGED CROSS,"""Why you are pretty well 'blowed'"" I said, with a poor attempt to be"
258,THE CHANGED CROSS,"funny, but immensely relieved."
259,THE CHANGED CROSS,
260,THE CHANGED CROSS,"""I never was so glad to see anybody in my life!"" and I meant it."
261,THE CHANGED CROSS,
262,THE CHANGED CROSS,"""There it is,"" he said; ""make much of it"" as he cleverly flipped a"
263,THE CHANGED CROSS,"little white missive over to me. ""Such billing and cooing I never want"
264,THE CHANGED CROSS,"to see again. Regular spoons, by jove! Can't go to sleep till she knows"
265,THE CHANGED CROSS,"you have not been melted, or washed away, or something. And Cato must"
266,THE CHANGED CROSS,come along to see that her precious brother doesn't get lost. Ugh! Lie
267,THE CHANGED CROSS,"down over there, old fellow!"" Then to me he said; ""Here help me out of"
268,THE CHANGED CROSS,"this wet thing."""
269,THE CHANGED CROSS,
270,THE CHANGED CROSS,"But I was engrossed just then, so ridding him of the offending garment,"
271,THE CHANGED CROSS,the broad-shouldered young athlete strode about the room in mock
272,THE CHANGED CROSS,impatience.
273,THE CHANGED CROSS,
274,THE CHANGED CROSS,"""Heavens! what a night!"" he exclaimed. ""What time does your train pass?"
275,THE CHANGED CROSS,Ten? Just three minutes. I guess I'll stay; but we will have that young
276,THE CHANGED CROSS,"damsel floating down here if she doesn't hear pretty soon."""
277,THE CHANGED CROSS,
278,THE CHANGED CROSS,"""Hello, Cato, what's the matter?"" as the dog gave a low growl, ""what's"
279,THE CHANGED CROSS,"that in the corner, Bowen?"""
280,THE CHANGED CROSS,
281,THE CHANGED CROSS,The dog continued to growl and look suspiciously as the young fellow
282,THE CHANGED CROSS,"rattled on. ""That,"" I said, ""is a dead man."""
283,THE CHANGED CROSS,
284,THE CHANGED CROSS,"""Humph!"" he laughed. ""Jolly good company for such a night. I say, Bowen,"
285,THE CHANGED CROSS,"you've got a nice toy there,"" and he took up the pistol that lay on the"
286,THE CHANGED CROSS,"table. In the meanwhile I had scrawled on piece of paper, which I had"
287,THE CHANGED CROSS,"quietly placed near the pistol: ""The man in the box is a burglar. Be"
288,THE CHANGED CROSS,"ready for an attack."""
289,THE CHANGED CROSS,
290,THE CHANGED CROSS,"""Oh that's the game!"" he said aloud, and instantly strode across the"
291,THE CHANGED CROSS,"room, as Cato sprang up and barked furiously at the box. Simultaneously"
292,THE CHANGED CROSS,"the top of the box flew up, and uttering a shrill whistle, the man"
293,THE CHANGED CROSS,"sprang to a sitting posture, while through the wide-flung door the"
294,THE CHANGED CROSS,"other two ruffians appeared with pistols cocked, At once there began a"
295,THE CHANGED CROSS,"deadly struggle. The dog had leaped upon the box and knocked the ""dead"""
296,THE CHANGED CROSS,"man's pistol out of his hand, as Frank shouted, ""Toho Cato!"" unwilling"
297,THE CHANGED CROSS,"that the dog should tear him to pieces, but wishing to keep him at bay."
298,THE CHANGED CROSS,
299,THE CHANGED CROSS,"""Your keys!"" yelled the other men; ""or by heavens, you'll drop!"""
300,THE CHANGED CROSS,
301,THE CHANGED CROSS,"Instantly closing in, man to man, the fierce struggle went on amid"
302,THE CHANGED CROSS,"shouts, oaths and pistol shots."
303,THE CHANGED CROSS,
304,THE CHANGED CROSS,"""Call off your cursed dog!"" screamed the ""dead"" man continually."
305,THE CHANGED CROSS,
306,THE CHANGED CROSS,"The encounter, which had occupied scarcely a minute, was at its"
307,THE CHANGED CROSS,"deadliest, both Frank and I endeavoring to disarm rather than kill, when"
308,THE CHANGED CROSS,"the whistle of the train sounded, and in another moment the conductor"
309,THE CHANGED CROSS,"and his men were among us, ""Seize that scoundrel!"" shouted Frank"
310,THE CHANGED CROSS,"breathlessly, indicating the man in the box. ""Here Cato!"" and the"
311,THE CHANGED CROSS,"obedient animal unwillingly retired, but continued his savage growl."
312,THE CHANGED CROSS,
313,THE CHANGED CROSS,"At this juncture my man fell to the floor, badly wounded in the leg, and"
314,THE CHANGED CROSS,"uttering groans and imprecations. It was quick work to secure the men,"
315,THE CHANGED CROSS,"and Jake, who opportunely reappeared, was sent to summon the village"
316,THE CHANGED CROSS,"police. Some of the passengers, impatient at the delay, had got wind of"
317,THE CHANGED CROSS,"the adventure, and now crowded into the station in no little excitement."
318,THE CHANGED CROSS,"The box was found to have a false side-piece next to the wall, which was"
319,THE CHANGED CROSS,"easily pushed down by the man inside, for greater comfort in his cramped"
320,THE CHANGED CROSS,position; and there were besides a number of air holes. It was the
321,THE CHANGED CROSS,moving of the side-panel that caused the muffled noise I had heard.
322,THE CHANGED CROSS,
323,THE CHANGED CROSS,"I was questioned in all possible ways, and the curiosity of the"
324,THE CHANGED CROSS,"passengers was fully gratified amid the clamor of the prisoners, who"
325,THE CHANGED CROSS,"continually swore at each other. ""What did you wait so infernal long"
326,THE CHANGED CROSS,"for?"" said one of them, glaring at the ""dead"" man."
327,THE CHANGED CROSS,
328,THE CHANGED CROSS,"""What was your infernal hurry?"" retorted the other, sarcastically."
329,THE CHANGED CROSS,
330,THE CHANGED CROSS,It was plain from the quarrel that ensued that the sight of my pistols
331,THE CHANGED CROSS,"and my evident uneasiness, together with effect of the fearful storm,"
332,THE CHANGED CROSS,"which confused all signals, had unsettled the fellow's plan, and had"
333,THE CHANGED CROSS,robbed him of his presence of mind. While puzzling as to the safest
334,THE CHANGED CROSS,"course, the sudden entrance of Frank and the dog had precipitated the"
335,THE CHANGED CROSS,catastrophe.
336,THE CHANGED CROSS,
337,THE CHANGED CROSS,"The men were conducted to the County Jail, and I was the hero of the"
338,THE CHANGED CROSS,"hour, although I could not claim much credit for personal valor in the"
339,THE CHANGED CROSS,matter.
340,THE CHANGED CROSS,
341,THE CHANGED CROSS,"Was it Fate or Providence that befriended me? But for my presentiment,"
342,THE CHANGED CROSS,"or what ever it might be, I should have urged Frank's immediate return"
343,THE CHANGED CROSS,to my anxious betrothed. But for her loving anxiety he never would have
344,THE CHANGED CROSS,come down on such a night. But for the dog one of us must have been
345,THE CHANGED CROSS,"killed. And first of all, but for the instinctive sense of danger the"
346,THE CHANGED CROSS,telegraph wires would never have spoken a warning to my excited fancy;
347,THE CHANGED CROSS,"and this manifest feeling of apprehension, though I strove hard to"
348,THE CHANGED CROSS,"conceal it, held the man in the box at bay."
349,THE CHANGED CROSS,
350,THE CHANGED CROSS,"The practical result of the episode was a more commodious station-house,"
351,THE CHANGED CROSS,and more men on duty. My salary was raised; but eventually I gave up the
352,THE CHANGED CROSS,situation because my wife could never feel satisfied to have me perform
353,THE CHANGED CROSS,night work after the fearful experience I have related.
354,THE CHANGED CROSS,
355,THE CHANGED CROSS,"As to Frank, he is not backward with explosive English whenever the"
356,THE CHANGED CROSS,"subject is mentioned, and no amount of persuasion could ever reconcile"
357,THE CHANGED CROSS,Cato to the station-room.

366,CHARACTER STUDY,
367,CHARACTER STUDY,"They were five sisters, all unmarried; they lived in the old Dutch town"
368,CHARACTER STUDY,that was made memorable by Barbara Frietchie's exploits. They never
369,CHARACTER STUDY,"hoisted a Union flag, or did any grand thing; but they deserve a place"
370,CHARACTER STUDY,"in story just the same. Their name was Peyre, and the young people"
371,CHARACTER STUDY,"called them ""The Pears"", not in derision, for the regard they inspired"
372,CHARACTER STUDY,was little short of veneration. Their ages ranged from sixty-five to
373,CHARACTER STUDY,"eighty years when I first knew them. Unlike the Hannah More quintette,"
374,CHARACTER STUDY,they were not literary. But no hive of busy bees was ever more
375,CHARACTER STUDY,industrious than they in the line of purely feminine accomplishments.
376,CHARACTER STUDY,
377,CHARACTER STUDY,"""The Pears"" were not poor, but they were frugal. They owned a"
378,CHARACTER STUDY,"comfortable two-story brick house on a quiet street, and let their"
379,CHARACTER STUDY,ground floor to a small tradesman. The way to the sisters led along
380,CHARACTER STUDY,"a smoothly-paved side alley, all fenced in, through a little kitchen"
381,CHARACTER STUDY,"with spotless floor and shining tins, up a narrow, crooked, snow-white"
382,CHARACTER STUDY,"stairway, and finally through funny little chambers, up two steps, or"
383,CHARACTER STUDY,"down three, till the workshop was reached. There they sat, clean and"
384,CHARACTER STUDY,"fresh and busy, each in her own nook; and just there they might have"
385,CHARACTER STUDY,been found every day these sixty years.
386,CHARACTER STUDY,
387,CHARACTER STUDY,The workshop had the appearance of tidy fullness. An everlasting quilt
388,CHARACTER STUDY,"was stretched across the end window, and here Miss Becky had laid her"
389,CHARACTER STUDY,chalk-lines and pricked her fingers through several generations. The
390,CHARACTER STUDY,"faithful fingers were brown and crooked, she said, from rheumatism; but"
391,CHARACTER STUDY,how could they be straight when eternally bent over the patchwork?
392,CHARACTER STUDY,Surely the quilt was not always the same; yet the frames were never
393,CHARACTER STUDY,"empty, and the chair was never vacant."
394,CHARACTER STUDY,
395,CHARACTER STUDY,"Miss Polly was housekeeper and cook, with Miss Phoebe to run errands, do"
396,CHARACTER STUDY,"the marketing, visit the needy, and supervise generally. Some one must"
397,CHARACTER STUDY,"have done the mending and darning and laundry work, but I never saw any"
398,CHARACTER STUDY,of that.
399,CHARACTER STUDY,
400,CHARACTER STUDY,Miss Sophie (the sisters said Suffy) was the knitter and her needles
401,CHARACTER STUDY,"were never still. Always a gray yarn stocking, and never any appearance"
402,CHARACTER STUDY,"of the finished pair. Go when you would,--and the dear ladies were not"
403,CHARACTER STUDY,"alone many hours,--the knitting was on and going on."
404,CHARACTER STUDY,
405,CHARACTER STUDY,Miss Chrissy was the beauty. Ages ago there had been a tradition of a
406,CHARACTER STUDY,"lover, but nothing came of it. Perhaps they had all five lived out their"
407,CHARACTER STUDY,little romances--who could tell? A certain homage was paid to the
408,CHARACTER STUDY,beauty. Her once brilliant auburn hair had paled to grayish sandy bands
409,CHARACTER STUDY,that lay smooth under a cap which was always a little pretentious. Her
410,CHARACTER STUDY,dark eyes and smiling lips made the soft white old face passing fair.
411,CHARACTER STUDY,Miss Chrissy was the embroiderer and needle-work artist. Her treasures
412,CHARACTER STUDY,"of scallops and points and eyelets and wheels, all traced in ink upon"
413,CHARACTER STUDY,"bits of letter-paper, were kept in a big square yellow box that was"
414,CHARACTER STUDY,bristling and bursting at all points.
415,CHARACTER STUDY,
416,CHARACTER STUDY,This box was marvellous. There could never have been but one other in
417,CHARACTER STUDY,"the world; and that I had seen under my great-grandmother's bed, the bed"
418,CHARACTER STUDY,"that had its dainty white frill, and its glazed calico curtains of gay"
419,CHARACTER STUDY,paradise birds. They were all of a piece and not easily forgotten. The
420,CHARACTER STUDY,"box had seen hard service among the ""Pears."" It was cross-stitched up"
421,CHARACTER STUDY,"and down the corner's along the bottom and the top, and all around. It"
422,CHARACTER STUDY,"never occurred to them to get a new one. Like their old Bible, its"
423,CHARACTER STUDY,places could be found.
424,CHARACTER STUDY,
425,CHARACTER STUDY,"I went, one frosty autumn day, to get a pattern for silk embroidery."
426,CHARACTER STUDY,Stamping-blocks and tracing-wheels were unknown quantities to Miss
427,CHARACTER STUDY,"Chrissy. Her stumpy little pencil--and that, too, seemed always the"
428,CHARACTER STUDY,"same--had to do the transfering. She liked a bit of harmless gossip,"
429,CHARACTER STUDY,dear soul; and the young girls of the town made a point of supplying the
430,CHARACTER STUDY,lack of a newspaper with their busy tongues. So she knew at once who
431,CHARACTER STUDY,I was.
432,CHARACTER STUDY,
433,CHARACTER STUDY,"""Oh,"" she said, with her kindly smile, ""you are young Mrs. John: I"
434,CHARACTER STUDY,"remember when your husband was a babe. I think I can find it;--yes, it"
435,CHARACTER STUDY,"is down in this corner,""--rummaging in the yellow box; ""here it is--the"
436,CHARACTER STUDY,"pattern your aunt,--Mrs. John, selected for your husband's first short"
437,CHARACTER STUDY,"dress. All the Hunt family were customers of ours. Mrs. John, she"
438,CHARACTER STUDY,"they called Aunt Lou, was a great favorite. She was rich, and had no"
439,CHARACTER STUDY,"children. Well, she came one day all in a flurry to get a pattern--a"
440,CHARACTER STUDY,"nice wide one she said, for little John's dress. He was the first baby,"
441,CHARACTER STUDY,and they fairly idolized him. This is it. I recollect the wheel and the
442,CHARACTER STUDY,"overcasting. It was--let me see--forty years ago, come this December."
443,CHARACTER STUDY,"Now, this little scallop is as popular as any"" and she fished up"
444,CHARACTER STUDY,"another, all full of needle-pricks. ""Some ladies don't like much"
445,CHARACTER STUDY,"embroidery, but they want a little finish. This one trimmed a set of"
446,CHARACTER STUDY,linen for Mrs. Senator Jones. It took me a good while to draw it. She
447,CHARACTER STUDY,"don't like this turn in the corner, so I made up something else. You"
448,CHARACTER STUDY,"know I design my own patterns."""
449,CHARACTER STUDY,
450,CHARACTER STUDY,Then resisting the temptation to give the history of the rest of her
451,CHARACTER STUDY,"favorites, she put the box aside and turned her attention to the quart"
452,CHARACTER STUDY,"bottle in hand, with its strip of muslin stretched tight around it,"
453,CHARACTER STUDY,"over a bewildering collection of grapes and leaves. This was her method,"
454,CHARACTER STUDY,and the admiring sisters thought it perfect.
455,CHARACTER STUDY,
456,CHARACTER STUDY,"That night I teased John's mother into hunting up the dress, and there"
457,CHARACTER STUDY,"was the identical pattern, edging the fine white cambric now yellow with"
458,CHARACTER STUDY,age. She was amused at my report of Miss Chrissy.
459,CHARACTER STUDY,
460,CHARACTER STUDY,"In my annual journeyings to the old town I never neglected ""The Pears."""
461,CHARACTER STUDY,"They always looked as if I had just stepped out for an hour, and come"
462,CHARACTER STUDY,back. The carpet did not wear out; the stove never lacked luster; the
463,CHARACTER STUDY,"tiny window-panes were always just washed, and the diligent fingers went"
464,CHARACTER STUDY,on just the same. They had a quaint way not easy to describe. When one
465,CHARACTER STUDY,"talked all the rest chimed in with little whispering echoes, to support"
466,CHARACTER STUDY,the assertion; and yet they did not seem to interrupt. They were to me
467,CHARACTER STUDY,"living wonders, so perfectly unspotted from the world, so earnest in"
468,CHARACTER STUDY,"their pigmy money-making, and so thoroughly united, I felt consumed with"
469,CHARACTER STUDY,curiosity as to their inner life. They must sometimes put by the
470,CHARACTER STUDY,quilting and the knitting and the patterns.
471,CHARACTER STUDY,
472,CHARACTER STUDY,"""How do you interest yourselves evenings, Miss Chrissy?"" I asked, half"
473,CHARACTER STUDY,ashamed of the question.
474,CHARACTER STUDY,
475,CHARACTER STUDY,"""Oh, we read,"" she said, smiling her ready smile. ""Yes, read,"" echoed"
476,CHARACTER STUDY,"Miss Suffy and the rest. ""We read Sunday-School books, and our Bible,"
477,CHARACTER STUDY,"of course. Sometimes we don't go to bed till ten o'clock."""
478,CHARACTER STUDY,
479,CHARACTER STUDY,"""Ten o'clock--o'clock--o'clock,"" assented the gentle voices. It was not"
480,CHARACTER STUDY,"silly; the smiling faces all wore the sweet, simple look of guileless"
481,CHARACTER STUDY,childhood.
482,CHARACTER STUDY,
483,CHARACTER STUDY,"Miss Suffy's window overlooked a time honored graveyard, where gray"
484,CHARACTER STUDY,slabs were tottering. Next to her beloved patterns and their varied
485,CHARACTER STUDY,"experiences, Miss Chrissy liked to tell of scenes and memories suggested"
486,CHARACTER STUDY,by these somber reminders.
487,CHARACTER STUDY,
488,CHARACTER STUDY,"""It was a very cold day, Mrs. John,"" (so she always called me), ""when"
489,CHARACTER STUDY,they buried your husband's uncle out there. Poor fellow! He was shot
490,CHARACTER STUDY,"at Buena Vista. A cannon-ball took off both his legs, and went right"
491,CHARACTER STUDY,through the horse he rode. He was a gallant officer. They thought at
492,CHARACTER STUDY,"first he would rally. The surgeons did their work quickly, and he"
493,CHARACTER STUDY,"suffered little or no pain, but there was no chloroform in that day, and"
494,CHARACTER STUDY,"he died from the shock. The snow was deep on the ground, but it was a"
495,CHARACTER STUDY,"grand funeral. They've got a fine new cemetery out on the hill, but we"
496,CHARACTER STUDY,"never go there. Our dead are all here where we can see their graves."""
497,CHARACTER STUDY,
498,CHARACTER STUDY,"""Graves,"" came the echo, they had all along nodded, or murmured, assent."
499,CHARACTER STUDY,
500,CHARACTER STUDY,"""One of the saddest funerals we have ever seen."" Miss Chrissy went on,"
501,CHARACTER STUDY,"""was a double funeral. Two young men, both only sons, were drowned in"
502,CHARACTER STUDY,the river while bathing. Their mothers were widows. It was terrible. Two
503,CHARACTER STUDY,hearses and two long lines of mourners. There they lie--over there in
504,CHARACTER STUDY,"that enclosure. They were cousins, and were buried side by side."""
505,CHARACTER STUDY,
506,CHARACTER STUDY,"""The mothers, Chrissy!"" mildly prompted the whisper, when the narrator"
507,CHARACTER STUDY,paused.
508,CHARACTER STUDY,
509,CHARACTER STUDY,"""Yes, the mothers! one died of a broken heart, and the other lost her"
510,CHARACTER STUDY,"mind outright. She is living yet, an old woman, who regularly goes to"
511,CHARACTER STUDY,the front door of the asylum every morning and takes her seat. If it is
512,CHARACTER STUDY,"cold weather, she sits inside. She asks every one who enters if Luther"
513,CHARACTER STUDY,"is coming--that was her boy's name."""
514,CHARACTER STUDY,
515,CHARACTER STUDY,"""Did you know the first Mrs. John Hunt, Miss Chrissy--my husband's"
516,CHARACTER STUDY,"grandmother?"" I asked, willing to change the gloomy subject."
517,CHARACTER STUDY,
518,CHARACTER STUDY,"""Just as well as I know you, Mrs. John. She was a beautiful little"
519,CHARACTER STUDY,"woman, I was very young at the time I am thinking of. She sent at night"
520,CHARACTER STUDY,"for an embroidered flannel I was doing. It was my first wide pattern,"
521,CHARACTER STUDY,"and it went slow. At 10 o'clock it was finished, and my father went with"
522,CHARACTER STUDY,me to take it home. They were all going to Washington to the President's
523,CHARACTER STUDY,"ball--President Monroe, it was--and the trunk was packing. It was to go"
524,CHARACTER STUDY,"on the big traveling-coach. When I ran up stairs and knocked,--I had"
525,CHARACTER STUDY,"often been there before--she opened the door herself. 'Oh, it's you"
526,CHARACTER STUDY,"Chrissy,' she said in her pleasant way; 'come in child; don't you want"
527,CHARACTER STUDY,to see something pretty?' And she showed me two elegant brocaded silk
528,CHARACTER STUDY,"gowns, very narrow and very short-waisted, but stiff enough to stand"
529,CHARACTER STUDY,alone.'
530,CHARACTER STUDY,
531,CHARACTER STUDY,"""She praised my work and said I was a good girl. Then she paid me the"
532,CHARACTER STUDY,money and tied a little blue silk handkerchief around my neck for a
533,CHARACTER STUDY,"keepsake. 'There,' she said, in her quick voice, 'you may go.' I did"
534,CHARACTER STUDY,"many other patterns for the family, but poor lady! she never saw me"
535,CHARACTER STUDY,again. She had an illness and lost her eyesight. She was stone blind for
536,CHARACTER STUDY,"many years. I have the keepsake yet. It is put away in the hair-trunk."""
537,CHARACTER STUDY,
538,CHARACTER STUDY,"The sisters were all in full sympathy, as usual. Thus I sat and listened"
539,CHARACTER STUDY,"scores of times, making a pretence of wanting a pattern,--anything to"
540,CHARACTER STUDY,get Miss Chrissy story-telling.
541,CHARACTER STUDY,
542,CHARACTER STUDY,"In the centennial year I found ""The Pears"" much shaken from their even"
543,CHARACTER STUDY,tenor. The relic-hunters had penetrated their omnium gatherum and
544,CHARACTER STUDY,offered fabulous sums for the quaint old bits they found there. One of
545,CHARACTER STUDY,them declared he must and would have these wonders for the New England
546,CHARACTER STUDY,Kitchen. But the sisters were outraged. Adroitly I managed to hint a
547,CHARACTER STUDY,"desire to see those treasures inestimable, and then for the first time I"
548,CHARACTER STUDY,"moved from my accustomed seat, and they moved from theirs. The magnitude"
549,CHARACTER STUDY,of their wrongs would admit of nothing like routine or monotony. The
550,CHARACTER STUDY,"chairs were pushed back, and I saw five tall, slim figures standing"
551,CHARACTER STUDY,"erect, in straight black gowns, white kerchiefs and spotless caps. They"
552,CHARACTER STUDY,"were devout Lutherans, and their pew at the Sunday service was never"
553,CHARACTER STUDY,vacant; but I had never seen them outside the workshop.
554,CHARACTER STUDY,
555,CHARACTER STUDY,"We filed into the funny little chambers where were the high beds, with"
556,CHARACTER STUDY,their steps to be climbed. What a wilderness of feathers and patchwork!
557,CHARACTER STUDY,"Some of Miss Becky's work was there. The bureaus nearly to ceilings,"
558,CHARACTER STUDY,"ornamented with round glass knobs, had their little mirrors perched"
559,CHARACTER STUDY,"up above my head. The candle stands, with spindle legs, wore an"
560,CHARACTER STUDY,"antediluvian look, and the chairs were just as queer. The more aspiring"
561,CHARACTER STUDY,ones were prim in starched antimaccassars. Even the footstools belonged
562,CHARACTER STUDY,"to a prehistoric age. There was nothing costly or elegant, but so very"
563,CHARACTER STUDY,"ancient and even comical, I had never seen anything like it, anywhere."
564,CHARACTER STUDY,"A few oil-paintings, hung in the very border of the huge-figured paper,"
565,CHARACTER STUDY,"were small, but evidently fine."
566,CHARACTER STUDY,
567,CHARACTER STUDY,"""These things were brought from Alsace,"" explained Miss Chrissy, as I"
568,CHARACTER STUDY,"commented freely. ""Elsace is the way to call it--and we can't bear to"
569,CHARACTER STUDY,"have strangers meddling with what is sacred to us."""
570,CHARACTER STUDY,
571,CHARACTER STUDY,"""Sacred to us,"" came from the procession behind."
572,CHARACTER STUDY,
573,CHARACTER STUDY,"At last, pausing before a huge hair trunk, they all gathered nearer, and"
574,CHARACTER STUDY,"when the lid was raised, they vied with one another in displaying the"
575,CHARACTER STUDY,"contents. It would take a great while to tell all that I saw, or their"
576,CHARACTER STUDY,curious little speeches and words and assents. There were samplers in
577,CHARACTER STUDY,"every style of lettering and color. The inevitable tombstone, with the"
578,CHARACTER STUDY,"weeping-willow and mourning female, was among them. Bits of painted"
579,CHARACTER STUDY,"velvet, huge reticules, bead purses; gay shawls, and curious lace"
580,CHARACTER STUDY,"caps--all showed patient handiwork. Gifts and souvenirs were plentiful,"
581,CHARACTER STUDY,even to the blue silk keepsake of the first Mrs. John. Then came
582,CHARACTER STUDY,"old-fashioned silver spoons and knives and tea-pots, heir-looms, they"
583,CHARACTER STUDY,"said, from the old country. A bit of coarse paper bore an order for"
584,CHARACTER STUDY,"supplies for soldiers upon the Commissaire at Nice, and was signed with"
585,CHARACTER STUDY,the genuine autograph of the great Napoleon. Every article had its
586,CHARACTER STUDY,"history, and rarely, if ever, was the little work-shop so long neglected"
587,CHARACTER STUDY,"as on that occasion. When the procession filed back, I took leave with"
588,CHARACTER STUDY,"somewhat the feeling of having been buried in wonderland, and suddenly"
589,CHARACTER STUDY,resurrected.
590,CHARACTER STUDY,
591,CHARACTER STUDY,Perhaps the shock of the dreaded vandalism was too much. Perhaps the
592,CHARACTER STUDY,excitement of the hair trunk struck too deep. At all events. Miss Becky
593,CHARACTER STUDY,"grew to muttering over her quilt, and making long pauses. One day her"
594,CHARACTER STUDY,"needle stuck fast in the patchwork, and her head quietly sank to rest on"
595,CHARACTER STUDY,"the rolled frame. When I paid my next visit, they said, ""You will find"
596,CHARACTER STUDY,"it very odd at The Pears's. Miss Becky is gone."""
597,CHARACTER STUDY,
598,CHARACTER STUDY,"I did find it odd. The quilt was rolled forever, and the end window was"
599,CHARACTER STUDY,"empty. There was only the chair. Still Miss Suffy sat with her stocking,"
600,CHARACTER STUDY,"and Miss Chrissy with her patterns, placid and patient,--they were only"
601,CHARACTER STUDY,waiting; yet working as they waited. Miss Polly sighed once in a while
602,CHARACTER STUDY,over her pans. Miss Phoebe still went to market and distributed small
603,CHARACTER STUDY,alms to the poor. Ripe in good works and in holy resignation were The
604,CHARACTER STUDY,Pears.
605,CHARACTER STUDY,
606,CHARACTER STUDY,"""Our quilter is gone,"" said Miss Chrissy. This time there was no"
607,CHARACTER STUDY,whispered echo; only a gentle sighing all around. But some of the
608,CHARACTER STUDY,scallops in the yellow box were not without fresh adventures; and these
609,CHARACTER STUDY,I heard.
610,CHARACTER STUDY,
611,CHARACTER STUDY,"That winter, Miss Phoebe fell on the slippery little side alley. There"
612,CHARACTER STUDY,"were no bones broken, but she, too, sank to rest in the old gray"
613,CHARACTER STUDY,churchyard.
614,CHARACTER STUDY,
615,CHARACTER STUDY,"It was three years before I went back. Then they said, ""Miss Chrissy is"
616,CHARACTER STUDY,"alone."" Alone I found her. She was little changed. The brightness had"
617,CHARACTER STUDY,merely gone from her smile. I noticed that her talk was less of her
618,CHARACTER STUDY,"patterns, and more of the gray slabs. She no longer clung to the proud"
619,CHARACTER STUDY,"little boast, ""I design my own patterns."" She was apt to tell what Suffy"
620,CHARACTER STUDY,"said, or Polly, or Phoebe, not forgetting Becky, our quilter."
621,CHARACTER STUDY,
622,CHARACTER STUDY,"""No,"" she said, when I asked: ""Polly was not sick. She said in the"
623,CHARACTER STUDY,"morning, 'Chrissy, do you ever feel strange in your head?' Next morning"
624,CHARACTER STUDY,she did not wake up. Suffy was never as strong as the rest--her back was
625,CHARACTER STUDY,"bad; so when she had a sort of fit one day, it was soon over."""
626,CHARACTER STUDY,
627,CHARACTER STUDY,"""You don't--you can't--stay here all alone?"""
628,CHARACTER STUDY,
629,CHARACTER STUDY,"""No, Mrs. John, Henrietta is with me. You know Henrietta? She belongs to"
630,CHARACTER STUDY,"the people down stairs. I shan't forget her kindness."""
631,CHARACTER STUDY,
632,CHARACTER STUDY,"""Are you very lonely, Miss Chrissy?"" I asked, choking down the tears."
633,CHARACTER STUDY,
634,CHARACTER STUDY,"""No, not lonely. The dear Lord is with me; He will stay to the end. No,"
635,CHARACTER STUDY,"Mrs. John, not lonely."""
636,CHARACTER STUDY,
637,CHARACTER STUDY,"She had always refrained, in diffidence, or humility, from religious"
638,CHARACTER STUDY,talk. I know it was from no lack of deep spiritual conviction. If ever
639,CHARACTER STUDY,"the world contained a purer, sweeter sisterhood, I have not known it."
640,CHARACTER STUDY,"Their work was homely, as their lives were secluded, but no one ever"
641,CHARACTER STUDY,saw them idle or impatient. In one straight and narrow path they walked
642,CHARACTER STUDY,through earth's temptations to heaven's reward.
643,CHARACTER STUDY,
644,CHARACTER STUDY,One of the last things she said to me was that I should take some of the
645,CHARACTER STUDY,"choicest patterns to my western home, notably ""little John's first short"
646,CHARACTER STUDY,"dress edge."""
647,CHARACTER STUDY,
648,CHARACTER STUDY,"""You have been a helper to us in more ways than one. God will bless you,"
649,CHARACTER STUDY,"Mrs. John."""
650,CHARACTER STUDY,
651,CHARACTER STUDY,"""Is there nothing you would have me do now? Dear Miss Chrissy, do not"
652,CHARACTER STUDY,"hesitate to speak."""
653,CHARACTER STUDY,
654,CHARACTER STUDY,"She did hesitate. ""I don't think of anything. My papers have long been"
655,CHARACTER STUDY,drawn up. Lawyer Thomas will attend to them. You know our little savings
656,CHARACTER STUDY,"are to go to the Home for Aged Women."""
657,CHARACTER STUDY,
658,CHARACTER STUDY,"I never saw her again. Sitting one day, placid and patient, she fell"
659,CHARACTER STUDY,asleep over the yellow box; and when they lifted the soft white old
660,CHARACTER STUDY,"face, all was still."

669,AN ADVENTURE,
670,AN ADVENTURE,"""Here we are, safe and sound,"" cheerily said the driver of the huge"
671,AN ADVENTURE,"black ambulance, as he pulled up before the piazza of Crestdale, the"
672,AN ADVENTURE,beautiful villa whose tower had been tantalizing the travelers for
673,AN ADVENTURE,several miles.
674,AN ADVENTURE,
675,AN ADVENTURE,A party of five descended from the wagon as the wide doors were flung
676,AN ADVENTURE,"open by the housekeeper, and a kindly welcome greeted them, as well as"
677,AN ADVENTURE,comfortable fires.
678,AN ADVENTURE,
679,AN ADVENTURE,"""My! how cold it is,"" exclaimed a fresh young voice, as the speaker"
680,AN ADVENTURE,hurried close to the generous heater.
681,AN ADVENTURE,
682,AN ADVENTURE,"""Be careful, dear, or you will burn your coat,"" warned an older lady,"
683,AN ADVENTURE,while a stalwart young fellow tenderly loosed the seal wrap in question.
684,AN ADVENTURE,
685,AN ADVENTURE,"Placing the fair wearer in a great arm-chair, he said: ""There,"
686,AN ADVENTURE,"Mademoiselle Jessie, be a good girl--if you can. Now, sister ours, what"
687,AN ADVENTURE,"can I do for you?"" turning gallantly to the other lady."
688,AN ADVENTURE,
689,AN ADVENTURE,"""Thanks, you foolish boy,"" was the pleasant rejoinder; ""look after"
690,AN ADVENTURE,"those parcels and those live commodities shivering there."""
691,AN ADVENTURE,
692,AN ADVENTURE,"The live commodities were a maltese cat, a canary bird, and two raw"
693,AN ADVENTURE,"recruits from Erin; and the ""foolish boy"" at once set about assigning"
694,AN ADVENTURE,places for people and things.
695,AN ADVENTURE,
696,AN ADVENTURE,"""There's a kitchen somewhere back here; come along, Michael. All right,"
697,AN ADVENTURE,"Katie, follow me, and fetch the menagerie with you."""
698,AN ADVENTURE,
699,AN ADVENTURE,"Duly installing them in their domain, the young man made his way back"
700,AN ADVENTURE,"through the wide, chilly rooms that intervened, and joined the ladies"
701,AN ADVENTURE,who were fast making themselves at home.
702,AN ADVENTURE,
703,AN ADVENTURE,"""A trifle bleak this, isn't it?"" he said, rubbing his hands before the"
704,AN ADVENTURE,"blazing logs. ""But just take note of that fragrant beefsteak. Say,"
705,AN ADVENTURE,"girls, I don't see any table set anywhere;"" and he looked ruefully"
706,AN ADVENTURE,around.
707,AN ADVENTURE,
708,AN ADVENTURE,"""Give us time, sir,"" remonstrated the elderly lady. ""Here is a move in"
709,AN ADVENTURE,"the right direction already,"" she added, as the housekeeper entered with"
710,AN ADVENTURE,the tea tray.
711,AN ADVENTURE,
712,AN ADVENTURE,"""Mabel, can't we have muffins?"" pleaded the young voice."
713,AN ADVENTURE,
714,AN ADVENTURE,"""Muffins! Not on such short notice; but you may have toast and eggs."""
715,AN ADVENTURE,
716,AN ADVENTURE,"""You'll disenchant me with your enormous appetite,"" chaffed the young"
717,AN ADVENTURE,"fellow, and got a saucy slap for his pains."
718,AN ADVENTURE,
719,AN ADVENTURE,"""Riding hours and hours on that horrid train is enough to starve any"
720,AN ADVENTURE,"one,"" was the ready defense; ""you only came from New York. Come on,"
721,AN ADVENTURE,"everybody, while the steak is hot."" And they gathered round to do"
722,AN ADVENTURE,justice to the repast.
723,AN ADVENTURE,
724,AN ADVENTURE,"Mabel and Jessie Winthrop were orphan sisters, the one fifteen years the"
725,AN ADVENTURE,"elder, and was mother as well as sister to her idolized charge. Her own"
726,AN ADVENTURE,"life romance was a buried chapter, and now she was chiefly concerned for"
727,AN ADVENTURE,the happiness of the two young persons seated there.
728,AN ADVENTURE,
729,AN ADVENTURE,"George Randolph was a distant cousin, and was to be married to Jessie"
730,AN ADVENTURE,Winthrop in two weeks' time. They had come down to make ready the
731,AN ADVENTURE,"seaside villa, which was their favorite home. It stood upon a winding"
732,AN ADVENTURE,"river close to shore, and commanded a view of the surrounding country"
733,AN ADVENTURE,for many miles.
734,AN ADVENTURE,
735,AN ADVENTURE,"It was an immense house, containing some twenty-five rooms, and"
736,AN ADVENTURE,"full of unexpected niches, nooks, and crannies. It was kept furnished"
737,AN ADVENTURE,"throughout, but was locked up in the winter months. An unlooked-for cold"
738,AN ADVENTURE,"wave, speeding from the northwest, had made the coming of the"
739,AN ADVENTURE,prospective bridal party a somewhat dreary affair.
740,AN ADVENTURE,
741,AN ADVENTURE,"A few happy touches here and there transformed the gloom into cheer, and"
742,AN ADVENTURE,it was with renewed animation that they arose from their repast an hour
743,AN ADVENTURE,later.
744,AN ADVENTURE,
745,AN ADVENTURE,"George was to return to the city next day, but would run down frequently"
746,AN ADVENTURE,"before the wedding day. Meanwhile this, their first evening, passed"
747,AN ADVENTURE,quickly and agreeably for all.
748,AN ADVENTURE,
749,AN ADVENTURE,"The ensuing week was a busy one. A whole army of sweepers, dusters and"
750,AN ADVENTURE,"renovators were turned loose in and about the villa, and the good work"

755,AN ADVENTURE,"was. It was necessary, however, that Mabel should make a final trip to"
756,AN ADVENTURE,"the city to purchase some articles, and she arranged her time so that"
757,AN ADVENTURE,George could return with her on the evening train.
758,AN ADVENTURE,
759,AN ADVENTURE,"""You won't be afraid, darling?"" was Mabel's fond question, as she made"
760,AN ADVENTURE,out her list.
761,AN ADVENTURE,
762,AN ADVENTURE,"""Afraid?"" echoed the other. ""Why, no; what is there to be afraid of? It"
763,AN ADVENTURE,"is perfectly safe here."""
764,AN ADVENTURE,
765,AN ADVENTURE,"""Yes, I know; otherwise, I would not leave you even for the day."""
766,AN ADVENTURE,
767,AN ADVENTURE,"""The house is big,"" said Jessie, ""but we have near neighbors. Besides,"
768,AN ADVENTURE,"there's Mike and Katie, and Mrs. Lawrence. Oh, I'm all right, Mabel"
769,AN ADVENTURE,"dear."""
770,AN ADVENTURE,
771,AN ADVENTURE,"""See that the house is securely fastened;"" was Mabel's parting"
772,AN ADVENTURE,"injunction as she kissed her sister goodbye. ""Look for us at the sound"
773,AN ADVENTURE,"of the whistle to-night."""
774,AN ADVENTURE,
775,AN ADVENTURE,"""Indade, Miss Jessie,"" said Katie a little later, her face in a pucker,"
776,AN ADVENTURE,"""indade it's not right for the loikes af yees to be here all alone."""
777,AN ADVENTURE,
778,AN ADVENTURE,"""Why, Katie, what's the matter,"" laughed the girl; ""you don't call this"
779,AN ADVENTURE,"being alone, do you?"""
780,AN ADVENTURE,
781,AN ADVENTURE,"""Ah, but haven't yees heard the quare noises in the tower, Miss Jessie?"
782,AN ADVENTURE,"An' shure there's a ghost in this house--Holy Mother defind us!"" and"
783,AN ADVENTURE,Katie piously crossed herself in real terror.
784,AN ADVENTURE,
785,AN ADVENTURE,"""A ghost, Katie! I'm ashamed of you. It is only the wind. It blows here"
786,AN ADVENTURE,"fearfully. You might turn a regiment loose in the house, and they could"
787,AN ADVENTURE,"scarcely make more noise than these big, rattling windows."""
788,AN ADVENTURE,
789,AN ADVENTURE,"""Arrah, me jewel,"" protested Katie; ""there's a turrible walkin' about in"
790,AN ADVENTURE,the tower ivery night these two noights. An' didn't yees hear about the
791,AN ADVENTURE,awful murther in the town over beyant us an' the murtherer iscapin'?
792,AN ADVENTURE,"Sich a quare murther, too, with the finger rings all left on, and the"
793,AN ADVENTURE,"money purse in the pocket. Ah, Miss Jessie, a murtherin' ghost won't"
794,AN ADVENTURE,"niver be laid."""
795,AN ADVENTURE,
796,AN ADVENTURE,"""You silly Kate!"" said Jessie merrily. ""Don't be afraid, I'll take care"
797,AN ADVENTURE,"of the ghosts. We are all right."""
798,AN ADVENTURE,
799,AN ADVENTURE,"After a cup of tea and a bit of toast, Jessie repaired to her chamber"
800,AN ADVENTURE,"on the second floor and picked up some trifle she was embroidering, to"
801,AN ADVENTURE,"beguile the time of waiting. Mabel and George would get in about nine,"
802,AN ADVENTURE,when they were to relate the day's doings around a good warm supper.
803,AN ADVENTURE,
804,AN ADVENTURE,"Katie was to follow and sit with her mistress, after she had done some"
805,AN ADVENTURE,righting up down stairs. Mike was bent upon routing an army of rats in
806,AN ADVENTURE,the barn. Mrs. Lawrence had retired to her room with a nervous headache.
807,AN ADVENTURE,
808,AN ADVENTURE,"The high winds from the sea had lulled, and for once the house was"
809,AN ADVENTURE,utterly quiet--so quiet that the stillness became oppressive. Meanwhile
810,AN ADVENTURE,"the young girl sat in her bower of luxury, softly humming a favorite"
811,AN ADVENTURE,"air, and very happy in thoughts of her approaching marriage. While deep"
812,AN ADVENTURE,"in her smiling reverie, a stealthy footstep distinctly sounded outside"
813,AN ADVENTURE,her door.
814,AN ADVENTURE,
815,AN ADVENTURE,"Raising her head, she had not time to feel a sensation of real fear,"
816,AN ADVENTURE,when cautiously her doorknob was turned and a head intruded itself which
817,AN ADVENTURE,"struck her as dumb as though Medusa had appeared, and drove the"
818,AN ADVENTURE,life-blood in a frozen current to her head.
819,AN ADVENTURE,
820,AN ADVENTURE,"The face was ghastly, the hair black and curling upon high, narrow"
821,AN ADVENTURE,"shoulders, the figure slight and spare, and a pair of restless black"
822,AN ADVENTURE,eyes were glittering swiftly and cunningly around the room.
823,AN ADVENTURE,
824,AN ADVENTURE,"""Hist!"" he said to the horror-stricken girl, softly closing the door"
825,AN ADVENTURE,and turning the key; and if Jessie had a distinct thought in that awful
826,AN ADVENTURE,"moment, it was of thankfulness that the winter dampness had so warped"
827,AN ADVENTURE,"the door that the key would not fairly catch in the lock,--a bit of"
828,AN ADVENTURE,repairing thus far overlooked in the wedding preparations.
829,AN ADVENTURE,
830,AN ADVENTURE,"""Don't be frightened,"" he continued, in his sibilant whisper; ""you will"
831,AN ADVENTURE,"take care of me, won't you?"""
832,AN ADVENTURE,
833,AN ADVENTURE,"But the girl's eyes only riveted themselves in more hopeless, helpless"
834,AN ADVENTURE,terror upon the apparition. Every muscle seemed paralyzed.
835,AN ADVENTURE,
836,AN ADVENTURE,He drew a chair to the open grate as if the fire were most welcome.
837,AN ADVENTURE,
838,AN ADVENTURE,"""You see,"" he said in his quaint, soft voice, ""if they track me here"
839,AN ADVENTURE,"they may hang me, and they would be wrong--all wrong. I did not intend"
840,AN ADVENTURE,"to kill her, but she would not hold still."""
841,AN ADVENTURE,
842,AN ADVENTURE,"At this he gave a blood-curdling laugh, and the horrible truth burst"
843,AN ADVENTURE,upon the listener's dazed senses. She was alone with a maniac. All the
844,AN ADVENTURE,"stories she had ever read rushed to her memory, and the only clear"
845,AN ADVENTURE,"idea she had was the conviction that she must, if possible, humor his"
846,AN ADVENTURE,"vagaries till help came. She was a petted, spoiled darling, but she"
847,AN ADVENTURE,"had great strength of will, and she now called it into requisition."
848,AN ADVENTURE,
849,AN ADVENTURE,"She hurriedly glanced at the clock, and calculated how long it would be"
850,AN ADVENTURE,before the train whistle could signal the coming of her dear ones. Alas!
851,AN ADVENTURE,"it was just eight. What, oh, what must she do? Of whom did he speak?"
852,AN ADVENTURE,Kill her? Kill whom? Then the mystery of the murdered girl darted into
853,AN ADVENTURE,her mind. Katie had been right then. There was in truth a murdered girl.
854,AN ADVENTURE,Was this awful creature her slayer?
855,AN ADVENTURE,
856,AN ADVENTURE,"Suddenly, with a confidential gesture he bade her sit down with him."
857,AN ADVENTURE,
858,AN ADVENTURE,"""I'll tell you about it,"" he said; ""if she had only kept still! But she"
859,AN ADVENTURE,"screamed and tried to run away, I can't stand noise!"" He clapped his"
860,AN ADVENTURE,"hands over his ears as if to shut out the echo of it. ""I must have this"
861,AN ADVENTURE,"blood--this pure, young, life-giving stream. But she would not listen to"
862,AN ADVENTURE,"me. Poor thing! It was too bad, wasn't it? Hey? Speak!"" and he grasped"
863,AN ADVENTURE,her delicate wrist with a grip of steel.
864,AN ADVENTURE,
865,AN ADVENTURE,"Trembling at the sound of her own voice, the girl commanded herself to"
866,AN ADVENTURE,say:
867,AN ADVENTURE,
868,AN ADVENTURE,"""Yes; who was she?"""
869,AN ADVENTURE,
870,AN ADVENTURE,"""I don't know,"" he replied, seriously. ""She was beautiful and fresh; she"
871,AN ADVENTURE,"was almost as fair as you,"" letting his wild eyes roam over her. ""I was"
872,AN ADVENTURE,getting away from that cursed place. Think of confining a man of my
873,AN ADVENTURE,learning in a madhouse! But that was just it. I had mastered the new
874,AN ADVENTURE,"theory--the transfusion of blood. They wanted to steal my glory, so they"
875,AN ADVENTURE,"locked me in. But I outwitted them; I captured these and ran away."""
876,AN ADVENTURE,
877,AN ADVENTURE,"Laughing wildly but still under his breath, he took from his jacket a"
878,AN ADVENTURE,"black case of bright, new surgical instruments."
879,AN ADVENTURE,
880,AN ADVENTURE,"""These were what I needed,"" he continued, with a low chuckle; ""I could"
881,AN ADVENTURE,"not attain the goal without these beauties."" Caressingly he went over"
882,AN ADVENTURE,"them. ""Lancet, probe, trocar, bistoury, tourniquet,""--mentioning the"
883,AN ADVENTURE,"collection, while he passed his fingers affectionately along the small"
884,AN ADVENTURE,sharp knives.
885,AN ADVENTURE,
886,AN ADVENTURE,"""For years and years,"" he went on, ""I have studied this theory. The only"
887,AN ADVENTURE,"thing is to find a young, strong, healthy subject; I found her. I was"
888,AN ADVENTURE,hiding in the bushes; she was on the highway; but she would not listen
889,AN ADVENTURE,"to me."""
890,AN ADVENTURE,
891,AN ADVENTURE,"""You did not kill her?"" the girl forced her dry lips to ask."
892,AN ADVENTURE,
893,AN ADVENTURE,"""Nay, nay; that is an ugly word. I had to sacrifice her--I did not kill."
894,AN ADVENTURE,Then the foolish mob came and I fled hither. But I had a bit of bread
895,AN ADVENTURE,and meat; she dropped her basket of lunch. I've been hiding in yonder
896,AN ADVENTURE,"tower,"" pointing upward. ""I thought I might find what I want; and now,"
897,AN ADVENTURE,"my dear, you will help me, won't you?"" This he said coaxingly."
898,AN ADVENTURE,
899,AN ADVENTURE,"""Help you? What can I do?"""
900,AN ADVENTURE,
901,AN ADVENTURE,"""Such a simple thing. Hold very still while I draw the rich red blood"
902,AN ADVENTURE,"from your pretty white throat."""
903,AN ADVENTURE,
904,AN ADVENTURE,"""You would not spoil my throat?"" pleaded Jessie in winning tones, with"
905,AN ADVENTURE,"the courage born of despair; ""such a very little throat,"" clasping her"
906,AN ADVENTURE,soft fingers about it in unconscious paraphrase of King Hal's hapless
907,AN ADVENTURE,queen.
908,AN ADVENTURE,
909,AN ADVENTURE,"""But where else can I find the glorious stream so rich and red?"" he"
910,AN ADVENTURE,"argued, with a perplexed frown. ""It must be transfused into my own"
911,AN ADVENTURE,"veins, that I, too, may be young again."""
912,AN ADVENTURE,
913,AN ADVENTURE,"""But not the throat! I could not sing any more then."""
914,AN ADVENTURE,
915,AN ADVENTURE,"""Ah, so--I heard you singing; it was not loud; it pleased me. Yes,"
916,AN ADVENTURE,"'twould be a pity. Well, I'll tell you what I will do. I'll open a vein"
917,AN ADVENTURE,"in your arm--just here,"" laying his finger on the round white member."
918,AN ADVENTURE,"""This will quicken the nervous centers. Then I will cut my own arm and"
919,AN ADVENTURE,insert your blood at the opening till the two life-currents mingle in
920,AN ADVENTURE,"one stream."""
921,AN ADVENTURE,
922,AN ADVENTURE,"He paused and reflected a moment. The generous warmth of the fire,"
923,AN ADVENTURE,"together with the terrified girl's enforced quiet manner, were evidently"
924,AN ADVENTURE,soothing to him.
925,AN ADVENTURE,
926,AN ADVENTURE,"""Listen now, very closely: Here is my greatest scientific discovery. I"
927,AN ADVENTURE,do not mean to impart the secret to another. It is the _transfusion of
928,AN ADVENTURE,"brain!_ Some other man's head got on to my shoulders, and my brain is"
929,AN ADVENTURE,"all wrong. Now with your red blood charged in my veins, and your young"
930,AN ADVENTURE,"active brain absorbed into my own uncertain head, I shall find the"
931,AN ADVENTURE,"elixir of life, and you will not have lived in vain."""
932,AN ADVENTURE,
933,AN ADVENTURE,Gracious Heaven! Did she hear aright? She had submitted to blood-letting
934,AN ADVENTURE,"once to gratify an old family physician, who insisted upon the remedy;"
935,AN ADVENTURE,"and she felt almost brave enough to endure the operation again, if it"
936,AN ADVENTURE,would only kill time and satisfy her tormentor. But to cut into her
937,AN ADVENTURE,"brain! Merciful God! What should she do? She could not escape, for he"
938,AN ADVENTURE,"watched her with cat-like vigilance. Scream she dare not, for so did the"
939,AN ADVENTURE,other frightened victim. She _must_ try to gain time.
940,AN ADVENTURE,
941,AN ADVENTURE,"With a rapt expression he continued: ""Since the days of Esculapius there"
942,AN ADVENTURE,has been no such transcendent theory as this which is to make me famous.
943,AN ADVENTURE,All my weary nights of thought and days of study are to be rewarded at
944,AN ADVENTURE,"last. Come child, are you ready? It will not hurt you. Only a little"
945,AN ADVENTURE,"pin-prick, and no pain. I would not pain you my dear."""
946,AN ADVENTURE,
947,AN ADVENTURE,"What if he should let her bleed to death! Oh sister, oh lover, come, or"
948,AN ADVENTURE,"she would die of horror, if not the knife! And Katie--why didn't she"
949,AN ADVENTURE,come! At this moment the sound of the train whistle in the distance
950,AN ADVENTURE,broke on the stillness of the night. How could she gain ten minutes
951,AN ADVENTURE,more? The man had not noticed the sound.
952,AN ADVENTURE,
953,AN ADVENTURE,"""What do you wish?"" she asked sweetly, ""What shall I get for you?"""
954,AN ADVENTURE,
955,AN ADVENTURE,"""Only a handkerchief and a basin,"" he replied coolly, still fingering"
956,AN ADVENTURE,"a sharp lancet. ""You are not afraid? Good girl; now for my crowning"
957,AN ADVENTURE,"victory!"""
958,AN ADVENTURE,
959,AN ADVENTURE,As a sleep-walker she procured the articles and bared her arm. Tenderly
960,AN ADVENTURE,"he was binding it above the blue veins, when she said in winning tones:"
961,AN ADVENTURE,
962,AN ADVENTURE,"""Let me tell you how I think would be the best way to do this--may I?"""
963,AN ADVENTURE,"and she fixed her large eyes upon him in entreaty. He paused, and she"
964,AN ADVENTURE,continued:
965,AN ADVENTURE,
966,AN ADVENTURE,"""Now let me tie your arm in the same way. You open your own vein with"
967,AN ADVENTURE,"the lancet, then open mine, and quickly after mix the two while the"
968,AN ADVENTURE,"blood is warm. Do you see? You can't fail if you do it that way."""
969,AN ADVENTURE,
970,AN ADVENTURE,He looked at her. She did not flinch.
971,AN ADVENTURE,
972,AN ADVENTURE,"""Perhaps you are right; very well."""
973,AN ADVENTURE,
974,AN ADVENTURE,She arose as deliberately as she dared and went to her dresser for
975,AN ADVENTURE,"another handkerchief. At the moment she opened the linen case her ears,"
976,AN ADVENTURE,"strained to the utmost, caught a murmur from below stairs. Turning"
977,AN ADVENTURE,"quickly to see if the man also had heard, the door was pushed open and"
978,AN ADVENTURE,Katie's neat cap filled the aperture.
979,AN ADVENTURE,
980,AN ADVENTURE,*       *       *       *       *
981,AN ADVENTURE,
982,AN ADVENTURE,"""Get on as fast as you can, driver,"" said George Randolph, as he and"
983,AN ADVENTURE,"Mabel took seats in the village stage. Then turning to his companion, he"
984,AN ADVENTURE,"said in reassuring tones: ""Don't be frightened, dear; she is all right."""
985,AN ADVENTURE,
986,AN ADVENTURE,"""I know it is foolish,"" said Mabel, half crying; ""but those wretched"
987,AN ADVENTURE,"placards made me nervous, and all that talk about escaped murderers and"
988,AN ADVENTURE,"lunatics. I am fairly beside myself; do hurry!"""
989,AN ADVENTURE,
990,AN ADVENTURE,"As the wide portals of Crestdale appeared, Mabel cried, in sudden"
991,AN ADVENTURE,terror:
992,AN ADVENTURE,
993,AN ADVENTURE,"""Something is wrong, George; see how dim the lights are! She would never"
994,AN ADVENTURE,"welcome us like this. Don't wait to ring; open the doors!"""
995,AN ADVENTURE,
996,AN ADVENTURE,"As George fitted his key in the lock and swung wide the door, a shrill"
997,AN ADVENTURE,"scream from above made their blood curdle. Shriek upon shriek followed,"
998,AN ADVENTURE,"as Katie came bounding down the stairs, almost knocking backward the"
999,AN ADVENTURE,two who ran past her to Jessie's room. White and lifeless they found
1000,AN ADVENTURE,"her, prostrate, her arm still bound with the handkerchief. She had risen"
1001,AN ADVENTURE,"nobly to the awful emergency, but succumbed when relief came."
1002,AN ADVENTURE,
1003,AN ADVENTURE,In vain Katie continued a shriek that a murtherer was in the room. The
1004,AN ADVENTURE,"anxious watchers bent over their stricken darling, who was now lying on"
1005,AN ADVENTURE,her own bed and beginning to show signs of life.
1006,AN ADVENTURE,
1007,AN ADVENTURE,"Before they could ascertain what had happened, for Katie was crazed and"
1008,AN ADVENTURE,"incoherent from fright, a furious ringing of the bell sounded long and"
1009,AN ADVENTURE,loud. Michael opened the door to a party of men who were in pursuit of
1010,AN ADVENTURE,a strange-looking person whose face had been seen at the tower window;
1011,AN ADVENTURE,"whether an escaped lunatic from the state asylum, or an escaped murderer"
1012,AN ADVENTURE,"for whom a large reward was offered, remained to be proved."
1013,AN ADVENTURE,
1014,AN ADVENTURE,The search was instituted with George Randolph at the head. The victim
1015,AN ADVENTURE,"was soon unearthed, but in a moment, laughing wildly in the frenzy of"
1016,AN ADVENTURE,"madness, he darted out upon the roof and, rather than be captured,"
1017,AN ADVENTURE,dashed himself to the pavement below.
1018,AN ADVENTURE,
1019,AN ADVENTURE,"All night they sat beside the brave girl, and bit by bit heard her"
1020,AN ADVENTURE,story. For days she was ill from the shock of her fearful experience.
1021,AN ADVENTURE,"The wedding was very quiet, but George refused to have it deferred."
1022,AN ADVENTURE,
1023,AN ADVENTURE,It was months before the bride could summon courage to live at
1024,AN ADVENTURE,"Crestdale, and she was a much older woman before she could refer with"
1025,AN ADVENTURE,composure to Katie's murtherin' ghost.
1026,AN ADVENTURE,
1027,AN ADVENTURE,
1028,AN ADVENTURE,
1029,AN ADVENTURE,
1030,AN ADVENTURE,Her Christmas Gift
1031,AN ADVENTURE,
1032,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,A WHITE RIBBON STORY
1033,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1034,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1035,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"She was born on Christmas Day, and so came, with her little white"
1036,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"face and solemn eyes, into her pale mother's life. She was worse than"
1037,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,fatherless. The beast of a man she might have come to call by that
1038,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"sacred name, would now be beside the snowy cot, weeping in maudlin"
1039,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"rejoicing over his new treasure, if the mother had not resolutely put"
1040,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,him away some six months before.
1041,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1042,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"The world knew him as Judge Barrett, a man of fine family, superb"
1043,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"talents, and a magnetic orator. He might be, perhaps, too convivial on"
1044,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"occasions, but was not this a common frailty among Kentucky's great"
1045,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,men? The wife knew him as besotted and disgusting. What mattered his
1046,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"learning, his eloquence, his aristocratic blood, or ample income? To her"
1047,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,alone he brought his degraded mass of humanity day after day; and though
1048,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"never personally unkind to her, or to the little boy that died, she was"
1049,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"enabled by the might of her tearless agony beside that tiny bier, to cut"
1050,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,the last tie that bound her to the blear-eyed creature sobbing on the
1051,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"other side. The last tie? Ah, woe was she! The coming time brought into"
1052,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,her desolate life the frail link she must now take up; and in the first
1053,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"bitter realization of her wronged womanhood, the mother-love lay"
1054,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,dormant.
1055,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1056,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,As the months went by the little Ruth twined herself in every fiber
1057,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"about that lonely mother's heart, till she was loved with a love that"
1058,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"was pain. So jealously guarded, too, that never once had the father's"
1059,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"eyes fallen upon her, not even by chance. In vain he sent appeals just"
1060,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"to look on his little daughter; he would ask no more. He was refused,"
1061,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,and the baby's nurse did not dare transgress.
1062,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1063,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,By-and-by Ruth was old enough to understand; and then she wanted to know
1064,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"who her papa was, and why he never came home as Masie Morrow's did. At"
1065,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"this her mother would be terrified, and clasping her treasure close,"
1066,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,would tell her she must never ask about her papa; he was a dreadful man.
1067,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1068,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"""Like Jack, the Giant-killer, mumzie?"""
1069,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1070,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"""Oh, my dearie, he is a great deal worse."""
1071,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1072,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"Again Ruth said; ""I know, mumzie, my papa is a great black thing like"
1073,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"the pictures on the circus papers!"""
1074,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1075,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,So it came to pass that Miss Ruth fell to thinking about her father till
1076,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,it got to be a sort of mania with her--wondering and wondering what it
1077,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"all meant. Her life was secluded, but she was fondly attached to her"
1078,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"grandparents and to a number of friends who were received at the house,"
1079,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,while her mother was most tenderly enshrined in the faithful little
1080,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,heart.
1081,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1082,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"The mother had a comfortable income, and provided her little girl with"
1083,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"the best masters. She was a quaint, white-faced, solemn-eyed creature,"
1084,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"as she had been from the first. She said ""old"" things, her black nurse"
1085,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"declared, and she knew her little ""missy"" was under a spell. If so, the"
1086,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,spell was tempered by an almost idolatrous love on the mother's part.
1087,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1088,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"When she was getting to be a romping big girl, she had just as queer"
1089,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"ways; too old for a child, though the sober, owl-like look began to"
1090,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"soften to an earnest expression, which on occasions verged upon a"
1091,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,twinkle in the deep blue eyes. Distant friends were now writing letters
1092,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"of inquiry, and her father's relatives persistently urged Mrs. Barrett"
1093,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,to send the child to them for a visit. At last she took Ruth and went;
1094,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"she would not trust her out of her sight. She was a pale, pretty,"
1095,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"gentle-looking woman, with a will of iron. It was to Judge Barrett's"
1096,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"sister, Mrs. Stanton, in a neighboring town, that they came. They were"
1097,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"afraid to mention his name, or hint at a possible reconciliation; but"
1098,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,they managed to make the young Ruth very much in love with her new

1100,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1101,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"Meanwhile her father had gone from bad to worse, a confirmed drunkard,"
1102,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,though rarely too far gone to make an eloquent stump-speech when
1103,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,occasion required. So popular was he that he had the sympathy of the
1104,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,community in his domestic estrangement. Some said his wife was too hard
1105,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,and unforgiving; all agreed that he should have been permitted to see
1106,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,his child.
1107,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1108,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,Ruth was seventeen years old and had long since exerted her filial
1109,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"influence to the extent of going to her aunt, Mrs. Stanton, whenever"
1110,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,she wished. She had come to be quite a sensation in her father's native
1111,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"village, his hosts of friends readily tracing a likeness to himself. She"
1112,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"was a sweet, rather wilful maiden, not exactly pretty, but very refined"
1113,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,and attractive.
1114,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1115,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"Judge Barrett had always found a bed at his sister's, no matter at"
1116,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,what hour of day or night he chose to stagger in; but the large family
1117,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,combined efforts to prevent the contretemps of a meeting between him and
1118,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"Ruth. Their promise to her mother was too sacred for trifling, and they"
1119,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"loved the girl too well to risk being deprived of her society. Destiny,"
1120,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"or chance, was too strong for them. It was on a bright, sunlit day, when"
1121,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,Ruth was in an animated discussion with her cousin Roger upon the merits
1122,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"of Vassar College, recently thrown open to young women, which he"
1123,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,declared was only a place where they transformed a girl into a boy.
1124,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1125,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"""Never go there, Coz, if you wish to retain an iota of your womanhood."""
1126,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1127,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"""Prejudice, prejudice;"" she retorted. ""I do believe in the higher"
1128,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"education of women and I am certainly going to Vassar, if I can persuade"
1129,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"my mother to part from me so long."""
1130,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1131,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"""Why not take her with you?"" Mrs. Stanton was saying, when horror of"
1132,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"horrors, there appeared at the side door of the large sitting-room"
1133,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"a flushed and tangled-looking creature, tottering and righting up"
1134,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"alternately. All eyes were turned upon him, and every voice was dumb."
1135,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"Steadying himself within the door, he slowly surveyed the young faces"
1136,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"grouped there, till his bloodshot gaze fell upon Ruth's white, wondering"
1137,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,countenance. Perhaps she reminded him of the wife who had repudiated
1138,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,him. Perhaps some dawning instinct was at work. He staggered up to the
1139,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"girl, who never once turned her eyes, and placing a hand upon her head,"
1140,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"said in the words of Childe Harold: ""Is thy face like thy mother's, my"
1141,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"fair child?"""
1142,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1143,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"Tears sprang to every eye; but Ruth, first gasping as with a revelation"
1144,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"from some long-dormant recess of her brain, arose, and catching his hand"
1145,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"as it fell powerless, burst out:"
1146,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1147,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"""_Who_ are you? Are you my--father? Oh, tell me!"" she appealed to"
1148,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"the group about her--""my father?"" and stood breathless before him."
1149,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1150,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,The word seemed to sober him with a mighty shock. He sank upon his
1151,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"knees, her hands still clasping his, and burying his hot face in her"
1152,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"cool palms, murmured in choking accents:"
1153,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1154,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"""Her father--my child--my God, I thank thee!"""
1155,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1156,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,But the strain was too much. In a moment more he sank all in a heap upon
1157,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"the floor, limp and lifeless."
1158,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1159,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"Passionately the girl knelt beside him, and looked searchingly into his"
1160,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"now colorless face, while the others hastened with restoratives. Nor did"
1161,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"she leave him during the days of illness that followed, except when"
1162,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,obliged to rest. Little by little they had told her the story.
1163,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1164,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"She only said: ""Oh, I never dreamed he was like this. I used to think"
1165,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"he must be something inhuman, horrible. Then I found myself staring at"
1166,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"every stranger, especially if he was monstrous, or in the least hideous."
1167,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"But I had given up all hope, and was afraid to ask."""
1168,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1169,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"""No, my dear child;"" soothingly said her aunt, ""your father is not"
1170,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"horrible, or hideous except that he is the slave of drink. He is not"
1171,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"inhuman, but a tender, loving creature. He is a gentleman, cultured and"
1172,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"learned. There is nothing fine in the language he cannot repeat, so"
1173,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"wonderful is his gift of memory. Oh, my child, can you not--will you not"
1174,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"help him? You can win him, I feel sure."""
1175,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1176,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,Ruth learned to love her father by reason of his idolatrous devotion
1177,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"to her, as well as the powerful influence of his brilliant talents. In"
1178,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,those first days of convalescence he followed her feebly from room to
1179,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"room, drinking in the joy of having her after the privation of years;"
1180,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,and one day folding her to his breast said:
1181,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1182,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"""My precious child--my beautiful daughter--hear your father's vow! Come"
1183,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"what will, nevermore shall a drop of the accursed fire pass my lips. I"
1184,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"will redeem our name--I can and I will."""
1185,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1186,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"He kept his word. Ruth went to Vassar. She wrote long, loving letters to"
1187,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,her mother and father every week of her school life. Once she said to
1188,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,her mother:
1189,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1190,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"""You know what I wish, my darling mamma. You know that I long to unite"
1191,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,my two beloveds; but never shall I ask it. You must follow your own
1192,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,heart. I believe my father will be worthy of us; I shall be guided by
1193,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"you alone."""
1194,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1195,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,At first the mother was stricken down by the fierce throes of jealousy
1196,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,and pain that rent her soul; but as time went on and she knew that she
1197,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"was not supplanted, she grew quiescent. But she owned to herself that"
1198,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,she never could have sent Ruth away if it had not been to separate
1199,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,her from her father as well.
1200,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1201,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,On every side his praises were sung in her ears. He was rising higher
1202,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"and higher in his profession, and one enormous fee in a contested will"
1203,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"case, had suddenly made him rich. Both were getting on toward middle"
1204,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"life, and he was slightly gray; but her brown hair lay in the same soft,"
1205,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"glossy bands, and her pure white face was placid as of yore."
1206,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1207,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"Four years had passed, and Ruth's birthday was at hand. Her mind had"
1208,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,long been made up; and now Christmas light and gladness reigned supreme.
1209,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,It was just at the close of the day when entering the fire-lit room upon
1210,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"the arm of her tall, distinguished-looking father, she threw her arms"
1211,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"about her mother and whispered three words,--""For our sake!"""
1212,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1213,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"Then kneeling with courtly grace before her, he kissed the fair hand he"
1214,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,had won in his youth and in tones whose music had thrilled her girlish
1215,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"heart, he spoke:"
1216,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1217,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"""My beloved, will you not trust me again? See--our darling has saved us"
1218,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,"for each other."""
1219,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1220,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,And the last ray of the roseate sun lingered lovingly on the three as
1221,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,the evening sank into blessed night.

1224,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1225,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1226,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,In a Pullman Car
1227,A WHITE RIBBON STORY,
1228,A LOVE STORY,A LOVE STORY
1229,A LOVE STORY,
1230,A LOVE STORY,
1231,A LOVE STORY,It was rather late when Hervey Leslie threw the remains of a cigar from
1232,A LOVE STORY,"the car window, and staggered through the jumping, jerking Pullman to"
1233,A LOVE STORY,his berth.
1234,A LOVE STORY,
1235,A LOVE STORY,"The curtains were all drawn, giving to the car a funereal aspect, and"
1236,A LOVE STORY,lights were turned down for the night.
1237,A LOVE STORY,
1238,A LOVE STORY,"Jerk, jerk, jolt and jump went the train around the mountain curves,"
1239,A LOVE STORY,till the various hats and wraps suspended from the hooks seemed about to
1240,A LOVE STORY,tumble together. Suddenly something dropped through the curtains of the
1241,A LOVE STORY,upper berth opposite and lodged there. Involuntarily extending his arm
1242,A LOVE STORY,"to catch it if it fell, our young traveler's eyes were riveted upon an"
1243,A LOVE STORY,"object which he now felt inclined to catch, whether it fell or not."
1244,A LOVE STORY,It was a small white shapely hand--a woman's hand; and the midnight
1245,A LOVE STORY,tresspasser would have been less than human if he had not risen to a
1246,A LOVE STORY,"better view. There it was, just peeping between the heavy curtains,"
1247,A LOVE STORY,"white and blue-veined, with tapering fingers and shell-like nails. How"
1248,A LOVE STORY,he longed to touch it! How tempting the rounded curve of the small wrist.
1249,A LOVE STORY,
1250,A LOVE STORY,"A prolonged lunge threw him violently forward, when grasping the rod to"
1251,A LOVE STORY,"save himself, his lips went plump against the coveted object. It was"
1252,A LOVE STORY,"only momentary, but it thrilled him as with an electric shock. When he"
1253,A LOVE STORY,recovered his equilibrium the fair sleeper had withdrawn entirely out of
1254,A LOVE STORY,"sight, and her involuntary assailant addressed himself to the duty of"
1255,A LOVE STORY,"disrobing. Long he pondered upon the ""touch of a vanished hand,"" and at"
1256,A LOVE STORY,"last fell into uneasy dreams wherein the world had come to an end, and"
1257,A LOVE STORY,"he found himself at the gates of heaven, with five soft white fingers"
1258,A LOVE STORY,turning the key on the other side.
1259,A LOVE STORY,
1260,A LOVE STORY,"""Last call for breakfast,"" shouted the porter next morning, and the"
1261,A LOVE STORY,confusion of voices mingled with the noisy folding of vacated berths.
1262,A LOVE STORY,
1263,A LOVE STORY,"Parting his curtains, Hervey Leslie peered out, possibly to catch a"
1264,A LOVE STORY,morning view of the pretty hand.
1265,A LOVE STORY,
1266,A LOVE STORY,"""By Jove! better still!"" was his smothered comment, as he hastily turned"
1267,A LOVE STORY,away.
1268,A LOVE STORY,
1269,A LOVE STORY,"What he had seen was the perfection of a French boot, buttoned high, and"
1270,A LOVE STORY,"protruding modestly below the curtains. Then a soft voice called--""Porter,"
1271,A LOVE STORY,"I should like to get down."""
1272,A LOVE STORY,
1273,A LOVE STORY,"The steps were adjusted, and as she gently fluttered down, the listener"
1274,A LOVE STORY,thought--
1275,A LOVE STORY,
1276,A LOVE STORY,"""What a shame I didn't have a chance to exchange berths with her! To"
1277,A LOVE STORY,"think of her being perched up there!"""
1278,A LOVE STORY,
1279,A LOVE STORY,An hour later Leslie returned from his cigar to find the Pullman in
1280,A LOVE STORY,"order, and the refreshed occupants enjoying the books and papers"
1281,A LOVE STORY,scattered about. It was not possible to mistake the owner of the hand
1282,A LOVE STORY,"and foot, whom a glance revealed in her corner, looking quietly upon the"
1283,A LOVE STORY,hurrying villages and farms. A coquettish hat rested lightly upon a
1284,A LOVE STORY,"fluffy mass of golden brown hair, a dainty tailored suit fitted closely"
1285,A LOVE STORY,"the rounded figure, and the face that looked out of the window was sweet"
1286,A LOVE STORY,"and bright even in repose. The coveted hand, in spotless kid, shielded"
1287,A LOVE STORY,"the earnest eyes from the glare of the morning sun, and all in all, the"
1288,A LOVE STORY,picture was one to tempt any looker-on.
1289,A LOVE STORY,
1290,A LOVE STORY,"Just as Hervey Leslie was puzzling his brain for a pretext, however"
1291,A LOVE STORY,"flimsy, to introduce himself, a lady came from the dressing-room and sat"
1292,A LOVE STORY,"down beside the beautiful unknown--a lady still young and handsome, and"
1293,A LOVE STORY,so closely resembling the girl as to leave no doubt that they were
1294,A LOVE STORY,mother and daughter.
1295,A LOVE STORY,
1296,A LOVE STORY,"""What has Charlie done with himself?"" was the pleasant question, met"
1297,A LOVE STORY,with a smile so bewitching that the watcher was hopelessly ensnared.
1298,A LOVE STORY,
1299,A LOVE STORY,"""So, there's a party of them,"" he mused. ""And who the deuce is Charlie?"""
1300,A LOVE STORY,
1301,A LOVE STORY,"But when that youth appeared he proved to be only a brother, and not a"
1302,A LOVE STORY,"very big brother, at that."
1303,A LOVE STORY,
1304,A LOVE STORY,Settling himself back in a corner from whence he could use his eyes and
1305,A LOVE STORY,"ears as he dared, young Leslie drew forth a letter which he perused with"
1306,A LOVE STORY,"interest; in fact, he already knew it by heart. It ran thus:"
1307,A LOVE STORY,
1308,"""MY DEAR SON,","""MY DEAR SON,"
1309,"""MY DEAR SON,",
1310,"""MY DEAR SON,","""Congratulate me. The all-important day is fixed for the 24th inst."

1318,"""H.J. LESLIE.""",
1319,"""H.J. LESLIE.""","""Confound Mrs, Dana!"" was the son's comment, for upon the subject of his"
1320,"""H.J. LESLIE.""",father's second marriage he was distinctly undutiful.
1321,"""H.J. LESLIE.""",
1322,"""H.J. LESLIE.""","For a while he lost himself in pictures of the new home, and mentally"
1323,"""H.J. LESLIE.""",resolved to absent himself as much as possible. He knew how his

1325,"""H.J. LESLIE.""",but he persisted in refusing to see the lady until after the ceremony.

1327,"""H.J. LESLIE.""",Suddenly with a terrific lurch the train was derailed and plunged down
1328,"""H.J. LESLIE.""","an embankment, not steep but rocky. The heavy Pullman toppled over, then"
1329,"""H.J. LESLIE.""","planted itself firmly in a bed of fresh earth, and was still. There were"
1330,"""H.J. LESLIE.""","wild cries of fear and pain, a loud crashing of glass lamps, and some"
1331,"""H.J. LESLIE.""","wrenching of seats. Leslie fell into a pile of great-coats, and flung"
1332,"""H.J. LESLIE.""","out his right arm just as the two ladies were dashed against him, and"

1335,"""H.J. LESLIE.""",When he recovered consciousness he found himself being pulled out of
1336,"""H.J. LESLIE.""","his corner, and realized by the agony of the motion, that something"

1338,"""H.J. LESLIE.""","handling, he relapsed into a dead faint. When he next opened his eyes he"
1339,"""H.J. LESLIE.""","was lying between cool sheets in a pleasant room, and bending over him"
1340,"""H.J. LESLIE.""",was the elder lady of the Pullman. The first bewildered look was rapidly

1511,A PRIZE STORY,on the _qui vive_ some hours later to see the new comers enter the

1515,A PRIZE STORY,"Various were the conjectures about them, and vague stories soon took"

1526,A PRIZE STORY,their half-clad occupants by one accord. A glance at the crackling

1534,A PRIZE STORY,After the first panic had subsided there was nothing to do but stand

1573,A PRIZE STORY,Before the earliest risers were called to the long breakfast hall there
1574,A PRIZE STORY,echoed the cry of a little child in the southern cottages--a girl baby

1598,A PRIZE STORY,"of the American eagle, and in every detail this unique costume was"
1599,A PRIZE STORY,alluring to a degree.
1600,A PRIZE STORY,
1601,A PRIZE STORY,"Dr. Mason was more than impressed by her extreme youth, in its setting"

1611,A PRIZE STORY,his face the shade of one bitter memory--one foul wrong that had
1612,A PRIZE STORY,"darkened his earlier manhood. A woman's fatal wiles, a man's trust"

1703,A PRIZE STORY,"a Kentucky girl, it was true; but her youth had been passed on a"

1709,A PRIZE STORY,there be sin or shame enveloping such a being? He must know. He wrote to
1710,A PRIZE STORY,Mrs. Carleton. In earnest words of manly truth and honor he besought her
1711,A PRIZE STORY,to explain to him the past. Eleanor was visiting a friend in a distant
1712,A PRIZE STORY,city. No answer came. He went to the house and was denied admittance. He
1713,A PRIZE STORY,followed Eleanor only to learn that she had been hastily summoned home.
1714,A PRIZE STORY,That was not the day of rapid transit. He returned at last to find a
1715,A PRIZE STORY,letter of farewell forever--his beloved had been spirited away to other

1717,A PRIZE STORY,and devoted the next three years to the study of special lines in his

1842,VENGEANCE IS MINE,
1843,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"""Ah!"" uttered Robert Garrett in a long-drawn-out syllable, reaching for"
1844,VENGEANCE IS MINE,the evening paper.
1845,VENGEANCE IS MINE,
1846,VENGEANCE IS MINE,There had been another silent witness of this scene in the person of
1847,VENGEANCE IS MINE,a lad who stood within the door he had entered just as Mrs. Blaine had
1848,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"appeared in the opposite way. He was a rather ill-favored schoolboy,"
1849,VENGEANCE IS MINE,but his thoughts as he came forward with the lanky awkwardness of youth

1852,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"""Father,"" he said after some minutes had passed, the rattle of the"

1865,VENGEANCE IS MINE,
1866,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"There was no encouragement to go on, so young Robert sat and pondered"
1867,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"till his father, chafing under the silent rebuke personified in every"
1868,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"line of the son's uncomely face, sent him to his room."
1869,VENGEANCE IS MINE,
1870,VENGEANCE IS MINE,In the other house there was little sleep; and for many succeeding days
1871,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"the devoted Blaines, with heavy hearts, put by their idols one by one,"
1872,VENGEANCE IS MINE,till at last the time-honored oaken doors closed upon them in relentless
1873,VENGEANCE IS MINE,banishment. It mattered not that amid new scenes prosperity once more
1874,VENGEANCE IS MINE,opened her sheltering arms and kept the wolf from the door. The new
1875,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"owner of Deering Castle, as the villagers had admiringly christened the"
1876,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"grand old place, refused to sell it. Robert Garrett, with the littleness"
1877,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"born of a mean, cramped nature, clung to this coveted possession as the"
1878,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"one thing to be held, though all else were taken. He had money but knew"
1879,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"not how to enjoy it. His household, for the most part, reflected the"
1880,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"coarseness of his nature, and as time passed his retribution was meted"
1881,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"out in rebellious sons and daughters, who wasted his substance and"
1882,VENGEANCE IS MINE,dragged down his name still further in the mire.
1883,VENGEANCE IS MINE,
1884,VENGEANCE IS MINE,Twenty years had gone by. Herbert Blaine and his bright-eyed wife slept
1885,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"in the city of the dead. With their latest breath they had, one by one,"
1886,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"adjured their beloved daughter, the only surviving child since the civil"
1887,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"war had laid low their three manly boys, to regain possession of the old"
1888,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"homestead. Time, they assured her, would make all things even, and long"
1889,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"before they laid down the burden of life, they had seen how the wife's"
1890,VENGEANCE IS MINE,curse beat upon the head of the man who had so oppressed them. They had
1891,VENGEANCE IS MINE,learned to feel pity for him whom they had once despised. Not so Jessie
1892,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"Blaine. She was a woman now, and had been, for a few brief years, till"
1893,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"death robbed her, a happy wife. But never could she forget that dismal"
1894,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"twilight hour when her innocent eyes had photographed the hateful,"
1895,VENGEANCE IS MINE,sneering face of her mother's enemy; when her ears had phonographed his
1896,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"mocking words. The scene had haunted her waking and sleeping, for many"
1897,VENGEANCE IS MINE,days; and still after all these years she could and did remember.
1898,VENGEANCE IS MINE,
1899,VENGEANCE IS MINE,She rejoiced when she heard that wild Ben Garrett had broken nearly
1900,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"every law of the decalogue, and was wrecking the peace of all who cared"
1901,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"for him. ""They richly deserve it all;"" she said, when some fresh"
1902,VENGEANCE IS MINE,escapade or misdemeanor would come to light. He had squandered his
1903,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"father's thousands aimlessly, recklessly, and was fast bringing his"
1904,VENGEANCE IS MINE,white hairs in sorrow to the grave. Jessie Forrester only smiled as she
1905,VENGEANCE IS MINE,read these items from the local press. Riches and honors were hers.
1906,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"There was nothing lacking but the dear old home of her people, and this"
1907,VENGEANCE IS MINE,could not be bought. She climbed to heights undreamed-of in her earlier
1908,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"days, and became a shining light in the world of letters. Her books were"
1909,VENGEANCE IS MINE,read in two continents. Statesmen and distinguished circles sought her
1910,VENGEANCE IS MINE,till her name became a power in the land. Her influence was widespread.
1911,VENGEANCE IS MINE,In an eastern city she at last came to revel in her books and
1912,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"manuscripts, or in her sweet, healthful, domestic loves, renouncing all"
1913,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"thoughts of revenge, for the time being, and abandoning the hope of"
1914,VENGEANCE IS MINE,recovering the sacred pile where she first saw the light.
1915,VENGEANCE IS MINE,
1916,VENGEANCE IS MINE,One day there came a letter bearing the postmark of her native town.
1917,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"With difficulty deciphering the straggling, tremulous address, she"
1918,VENGEANCE IS MINE,broke the seal and read as follows:--

1924,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"who was once as innocent and pure as yourself, has fallen into the"
1925,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"hands of treacherous natives and half-breeds in Arkansas, and they"
1926,VENGEANCE IS MINE,accuse him of murdering a traveller for his money. He is guiltless
1927,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"of this crime--God knows he is; but the weight of evidence is fearful,"
1928,VENGEANCE IS MINE,and I am powerless to refute it. The proceedings have been hurried
1929,VENGEANCE IS MINE,over and the verdict is against him.
1930,VENGEANCE IS MINE,
1931,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"""I am unable to go to him--I bring the case to you. Go, I beg of you,"

1945,VENGEANCE IS MINE,Jessie Forrester's hour had come. The revenge so ardently longed-for
1946,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"since the hour her mother had invoked the curse of heaven upon this man,"
1947,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"was here. What though his boy did perish, by an ignominous death. A more"
1948,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"worthless cumberer of the earth did not exist. Ah! that cold, sneering"
1949,VENGEANCE IS MINE,voice on the winter's eve so long ago; her mother's tears! As he had
1950,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"sown so should he reap, and her hands would help to gather in the"
1951,VENGEANCE IS MINE,harvest. Through him they had been exiled all these years from the home
1952,VENGEANCE IS MINE,that was their birthright. The husband of her early womanhood might
1953,VENGEANCE IS MINE,have been spared if only they could have nursed him back to health under
1954,VENGEANCE IS MINE,the cool shade of those grand old trees instead of languishing in the
1955,VENGEANCE IS MINE,hot city. Help this man? This incarnation of cruel selfishness? Not
1956,VENGEANCE IS MINE,she;--his boy should suffer the extreme penalty of the law. How could
1957,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"_she_ lift a voice to save him! ""His boy?"" Ah, through her tender"
1958,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"mother's heart there darted a pain all unwonted. Her own noble, gifted"
1959,VENGEANCE IS MINE,boy--her all--what if untoward fate should have in store for him some
1960,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"doom of shame--him, her idol and her pride."
1961,VENGEANCE IS MINE,
1962,VENGEANCE IS MINE,She sat buried in thought till suddenly starting up she consulted
1963,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"a time table, then rang hurriedly for her maid. She was ready in thirty"
1964,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"minutes, and summoning her young son, was soon enroute for the capital."
1965,VENGEANCE IS MINE,Arriving at ten o'clock she called a carriage and sped away to new
1966,VENGEANCE IS MINE,northwest quarter of the city. By midnight she had seen both
1967,VENGEANCE IS MINE,representatives and thoroughly enlisted their services. She gave no
1968,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"reason for her intercession, nor was it necessary. It was enough that"
1969,VENGEANCE IS MINE,she deemed it a case for intervention. Next morning the two statesmen
1970,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"had an interview with the President, and by the hardest, for the mass"
1971,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"of evidence against young Garrett was overwhelming, got a stay of"
1972,VENGEANCE IS MINE,proceedings till the case could be further investigated.
1973,VENGEANCE IS MINE,
1974,VENGEANCE IS MINE,"Well-nigh exhausted from the mental and bodily strain, Jessie arrived"
1975,VENGEANCE IS MINE,at her home unfit for anything but rest. Then she answered her enemy's
1976,VENGEANCE IS MINE,letter. Did she reproach him with his life-long injustice? Did she
1977,VENGEANCE IS MINE,demand the old home in exchange for the service she had rendered? Or
1978,VENGEANCE IS MINE,at least the privilege of buying it? She merely wrote;--

2081,A HOLIDAY STORY,"Fixing his faded eyes, now kindling with something like hope, upon her"

2114,A HOLIDAY STORY,
2115,A HOLIDAY STORY,"But the singer was again leaning toward the waiting figure outside,"

2117,A HOLIDAY STORY,
2118,A HOLIDAY STORY,"""That is why I was asking for help, madam; people are generous at"

2121,A HOLIDAY STORY,The prima donna was not rich. She supported her own old father and

2123,A HOLIDAY STORY,"those quick impulses born of heaven, she ordered the driver to descend"
2124,A HOLIDAY STORY,from his box and throw open the carriage. When the roof parted and the
2125,A HOLIDAY STORY,"sunshine came flooding down upon her, the singer faced the crowd that"
2126,A HOLIDAY STORY,"had been steadily gathering for ten minutes, eager to see the Signora"
2127,A HOLIDAY STORY,"Cavada, whose voice was the most jealously guarded jewel of her store."
2128,A HOLIDAY STORY,For she had been recognized by a chance passer-by.
2129,A HOLIDAY STORY,
2130,A HOLIDAY STORY,Suddenly there stole on the air a divine strain that caused a hush as
2131,A HOLIDAY STORY,"by magic to fall upon the restless groups. Louder, sweeter, stronger,"
2132,A HOLIDAY STORY,"more entrancing it rose, then sunk to the whispering cadence of a sigh."
2133,A HOLIDAY STORY,"The old man's hands were crossed before him, and tears poured down his"

2136,A HOLIDAY STORY,"toward the crowd, which was increasing every moment, said,--"

2139,A HOLIDAY STORY,
2140,A HOLIDAY STORY,The old man went from one to another till the worn hat grew so heavy

2143,A HOLIDAY STORY,"scribbled an address which she handed the bewildered man, and drove on"
2144,A HOLIDAY STORY,to her hotel.
2145,A HOLIDAY STORY,
2146,A HOLIDAY STORY,What a Christmas was that! And what a feeling of happiness filled her

2148,A HOLIDAY STORY,
2149,A HOLIDAY STORY,A day or two later the beggar and his grandchild appeared at the private

2161,A HOLIDAY STORY,
2162,A HOLIDAY STORY,"""Santa Maria!"" exclaimed the signora, who always ejaculated in her own"

2165,A HOLIDAY STORY,
2166,A HOLIDAY STORY,"Touching an electric bell, she summoned a messenger and hastily wrote"
2167,A HOLIDAY STORY,a line which she gave him. During the boy's absence she questioned the

2169,A HOLIDAY STORY,"what there was to tell of their daily life. Their neighbors were kind,"
2170,A HOLIDAY STORY,and the women exercised a sort of motherly care over the little girl;
2171,A HOLIDAY STORY,"but the very best there was to know seemed bad enough, and the singer"

2453,STORY OF A WIFE,
2454,STORY OF A WIFE,"Did she hear aright? Was it of her, Eleanor Woodruff, that they were"
2455,STORY OF A WIFE,"talking? Swiftly she sped out of the dark, heavily-curtained back parlor"
2456,STORY OF A WIFE,"of the stylish boarding-house, and into her room, a gorgeous alcove"
2457,STORY OF A WIFE,apartment on the first floor. She could not mount the stairs on account
2458,STORY OF A WIFE,of her weak spine. Weak spine? She forgot all about it as she paced the
2459,STORY OF A WIFE,"floor, angry tears gushing from her large brown eyes. It was shameful--it"
2460,STORY OF A WIFE,was wicked--to be so abused. She had never in her whole petted life been
2461,STORY OF A WIFE,"found fault with. As to money, what did she know about it? Her father,"
2462,STORY OF A WIFE,"before his failure and death, had always gratified her. Her husband had"
2463,STORY OF A WIFE,never made any difference. These men were friends of his.
2464,STORY OF A WIFE,
2465,STORY OF A WIFE,"Her bitter sobs ceased, and her wounded vanity gradually lost itself"

2467,STORY OF A WIFE,"criticisms of those two chance callers, who thus killed the time of"
2468,STORY OF A WIFE,waiting for someone to come down to them? She began to feel glad that
2469,STORY OF A WIFE,she had overheard it. The merest accident had sent her into the back
2470,STORY OF A WIFE,"parlor. Was it true? What ought she to do? What could she do? Her dear,"
2471,STORY OF A WIFE,"kind husband in trouble, and she the cause. Long she sat buried in"
2472,STORY OF A WIFE,"thought, and when the well-known step sounded at the door her face was"
2473,STORY OF A WIFE,radiant with a new resolve.
2474,STORY OF A WIFE,
2475,STORY OF A WIFE,"He came to her large easy-chair with a step somewhat weary, but his kiss"

2481,STORY OF A WIFE,
2482,STORY OF A WIFE,"""I look as if I love my big boy very much, don't I?"" she responded"
2483,STORY OF A WIFE,merrily.
2484,STORY OF A WIFE,
2485,STORY OF A WIFE,"His answer was another kiss, and as he turned toward his dressing"
2486,STORY OF A WIFE,"closet, her heart ached with unspoken tenderness. Her dinner was brought"
2487,STORY OF A WIFE,in. She was not considered strong enough to sit at table. For this
2488,STORY OF A WIFE,service an extra charge was made.
2489,STORY OF A WIFE,
2490,STORY OF A WIFE,"Later, when he opened the evening paper, she sat and watched him. Surely"
2491,STORY OF A WIFE,"those lines of care were new, now that he was not smiling fondly upon"
2492,STORY OF A WIFE,"her. Oh, foolish, selfish wife! Rising gently, her long silken tea-gown"
2493,STORY OF A WIFE,"trailing behind her, she stood beside him, one slender white hand upon"
2494,STORY OF A WIFE,his shoulder.
2495,STORY OF A WIFE,
2496,STORY OF A WIFE,"""Well, dear, what now? Another new gown?"" he asked, with his old, sweet"

2498,STORY OF A WIFE,
2499,STORY OF A WIFE,"She pressed her lips in a slow, reverential fashion, upon the broad"
2500,STORY OF A WIFE,"white brow, another pang at her heart. Then she spoke:"
2501,STORY OF A WIFE,
2502,STORY OF A WIFE,"""Not this time. Harry, dear, let's go to Mrs. Wickham's to board."""
2503,STORY OF A WIFE,
2504,STORY OF A WIFE,"""Mrs. Wickham's!"" he echoed. ""Why, you wouldn't stay in her dull little"
2505,STORY OF A WIFE,"place a week."""
2506,STORY OF A WIFE,
2507,STORY OF A WIFE,But even as he spoke there flashed through his mind in rapid
2508,STORY OF A WIFE,"calculation, ""Twenty dollars a week there, forty here; eighty dollars"
2509,STORY OF A WIFE,"a month saved; nearly a thousand dollars a year."""
2510,STORY OF A WIFE,
2511,STORY OF A WIFE,"""Don't you like it here?"" were his next words, as he glanced around the"
2512,STORY OF A WIFE,luxurious suite.
2513,STORY OF A WIFE,
2514,STORY OF A WIFE,"""Yes,"" she said, ""except there are too many people. It is so noisy."""
2515,STORY OF A WIFE,
2516,STORY OF A WIFE,"""Very well, then, we will try it; anything to please my darling,"" and he"
2517,STORY OF A WIFE,"drew her close, wrapped in his arms as one might lull a restless child."
2518,STORY OF A WIFE,
2519,STORY OF A WIFE,"The move was made, and Eleanor found that she was not as much fatigued"
2520,STORY OF A WIFE,as she had often felt after a day's lounging with a novel. Her husband
2521,STORY OF A WIFE,"thought it only a new whim; but as it was not expensive one, he could"
2522,STORY OF A WIFE,"not remonstrate. When he wanted to take her driving, she playfully told"
2523,STORY OF A WIFE,him she was learning to walk--horses made her nervous.
2524,STORY OF A WIFE,
2525,STORY OF A WIFE,"The first step, she thought; now for the next. It came to her almost by"
2526,STORY OF A WIFE,"magic. In a little rear hall-room sat Margaret Dewees, clicking away at"
2527,STORY OF A WIFE,"her typewriter. A strong, clear-headed girl who had maintained herself"
2528,STORY OF A WIFE,"these ten years, and had put by her savings. She was soon to be married"
2529,STORY OF A WIFE,"to a stalwart young farmer, the lover of her early youth. They had been"
2530,STORY OF A WIFE,working and waiting. From the first she took an interest in the young
2531,STORY OF A WIFE,"wife, and it was given to her energy and common sense to help a"
2532,STORY OF A WIFE,suffering sister. Together they plotted and planned. Eleanor's lassitude
2533,STORY OF A WIFE,gradually passed away under vigorous rubbing and brisk walks.
2534,STORY OF A WIFE,
2535,STORY OF A WIFE,Margaret's trousseau was a thing to be considered. From Mrs. Woodruff's
2536,STORY OF A WIFE,surplus stock of stylish gowns and garments the country girl's outfit
2537,STORY OF A WIFE,was deftly concocted. The young wife could sew neatly and rapidly. When
2538,STORY OF A WIFE,all was ready the sum of two hundred dollars lay in her writing desk.
2539,STORY OF A WIFE,"Her grand piano, too large for the new quarters, was removed from"
2540,STORY OF A WIFE,"storage to a dealer's, and was sold for three hundred more. She wrote at"
2541,STORY OF A WIFE,"once to an uncle in a Western city; told him of her little efforts, and"
2542,STORY OF A WIFE,asked what she might do with her mite. He was a real estate man and
2543,STORY OF A WIFE,promptly invested it in a lot in the rising town of Duluth.
2544,STORY OF A WIFE,
2545,STORY OF A WIFE,"In exchange for her services as seamstress, Margaret taught Eleanor the"
2546,STORY OF A WIFE,"use of the typewriter. When she was married she left the instrument, for"
2547,STORY OF A WIFE,"the summer months, in Eleanor's care. A nominal rent was agreed upon,"
2548,STORY OF A WIFE,"and this was easy to pay, as Margaret's engagements were transferred to"
2549,STORY OF A WIFE,"the new operator, while she, herself, attended to chickens and cows, and"
2550,STORY OF A WIFE,her six feet of husband.
2551,STORY OF A WIFE,
2552,STORY OF A WIFE,Eleanor's spirit of enterprise did not stop here. She obtained pupils on
2553,STORY OF A WIFE,the type-writer machine at five dollars each. She shipped a lot of old
2554,STORY OF A WIFE,"party dresses, crushed and out of style, to the costumer's on B----"
2555,STORY OF A WIFE,"street, and saved the proceeds. Every time her husband handed over her"
2556,STORY OF A WIFE,"allowance of pin money, she put at least half of it in her ""strong box."""
2557,STORY OF A WIFE,
2558,STORY OF A WIFE,"It was hard to hide all this activity and cheerfulness from him, but"
2559,STORY OF A WIFE,"she did. With her woman's enjoyment of a little mystery, and her high"
2560,STORY OF A WIFE,"resolve to show herself worthy of him, she kept in the old rut as nearly"
2561,STORY OF A WIFE,"as possible when he was at home. He saw only that she was stronger, and"
2562,STORY OF A WIFE,it lightened his labors.
2563,STORY OF A WIFE,
2564,STORY OF A WIFE,"""My little woman does not ride, or read, any more,"" he said one evening,"
2565,STORY OF A WIFE,in the indulgent tone he used towards her.
2566,STORY OF A WIFE,
2567,STORY OF A WIFE,"""Why, yes, I do read. Don't you see my little library there?"""
2568,STORY OF A WIFE,
2569,STORY OF A WIFE,"""Yes, but it seems to me I miss something."""

2571,STORY OF A WIFE,He missed the litter of trashy novels he had been wont to see.
2572,STORY OF A WIFE,
2573,STORY OF A WIFE,"""I told you I was learning to walk;"" she added, with a smile, ""I really"
2574,STORY OF A WIFE,"do walk somewhere every day."""
2575,STORY OF A WIFE,
2576,STORY OF A WIFE,"""That pleases me most of all,"" he said in his cheery way, ""but what will"
2577,STORY OF A WIFE,"Dr. Bull think. You know he prescribes rest and quiet."""
2578,STORY OF A WIFE,
2579,STORY OF A WIFE,"""I don't care one bit; I have long since cut his acquaintance."""

2582,STORY OF A WIFE,
2583,STORY OF A WIFE,The end of the year rolled round. Eleanor watched her husband's face
2584,STORY OF A WIFE,with ever increasing anxiety. One evening he sat buried in thought from
2585,STORY OF A WIFE,"which all her endeavors could not rouse him. He did not feel well, he"
2586,STORY OF A WIFE,said. All night he tossed and muttered. Calculations and figures were
2587,STORY OF A WIFE,uppermost.
2588,STORY OF A WIFE,
2589,STORY OF A WIFE,"He was up early, as usual, and away. Eleanor hastened her preparations,"
2590,STORY OF A WIFE,and carefully counted her little hoard--the earnings of months. Early
2591,STORY OF A WIFE,in the afternoon she came home with the proceeds of her last batch of
2592,STORY OF A WIFE,"type-writing, glowing with exercise, and the happiness of contributing"
2593,STORY OF A WIFE,"at least some hundreds to meet her husband's creditors. He was there,"
2594,STORY OF A WIFE,"lying on the sofa, pale and hopeless. Forgetting all else, she flung"
2595,STORY OF A WIFE,herself beside him with a sob.
2596,STORY OF A WIFE,
2597,STORY OF A WIFE,"""Oh! Harry, my dearest! Tell me what it is that is killing you--I have a"
2598,STORY OF A WIFE,"right to know."""
2599,STORY OF A WIFE,
2600,STORY OF A WIFE,"""It is ruin, Eleanor. I have brought you to poverty--you whom I would"
2601,STORY OF A WIFE,"have given my very life to make happy."""
2602,STORY OF A WIFE,
2603,STORY OF A WIFE,"""You are talking in riddles, Harry,"" she exclaimed, rallying from her"
2604,STORY OF A WIFE,"alarm. ""Am I not the happiest woman in the world? And don't you see how"
2605,STORY OF A WIFE,"well and strong I am?"""
2606,STORY OF A WIFE,
2607,STORY OF A WIFE,"She coaxed the whole story from his lips. Then with affected lightness,"
2608,STORY OF A WIFE,"she said: ""Is that all? Why, you frightened me terribly; I thought you"
2609,STORY OF A WIFE,"were ill--had caught some horrible disease or other. See here!"""
2610,STORY OF A WIFE,
2611,STORY OF A WIFE,"As she spoke she ran to her desk, took out her treasure, and poured it"
2612,STORY OF A WIFE,into his hands in her impulsive fashion.
2613,STORY OF A WIFE,
2614,STORY OF A WIFE,"""Eleanor! What is this?"" staring like one dazed, from her radiant face"
2615,STORY OF A WIFE,to the notes in his hands.
2616,STORY OF A WIFE,
2617,STORY OF A WIFE,"""This? Why, this is only your silly wife's laziness and selfishness in"
2618,STORY OF A WIFE,"another form."""
2619,STORY OF A WIFE,
2620,STORY OF A WIFE,Then her story had to be told. Their combined efforts still fell short
2621,STORY OF A WIFE,"of the required sum, but she triumphantly produced the deed to the"
2622,STORY OF A WIFE,"Western land. For a season there were caresses and even tears, of mutual"
2623,STORY OF A WIFE,love and thankfulness.
2624,STORY OF A WIFE,
2625,STORY OF A WIFE,"""My precious wife!"" he exclaimed, as he clasped her close. ""What a"
2626,STORY OF A WIFE,"treasure in you, if all the money in the world should fail!"""
2627,STORY OF A WIFE,
2628,STORY OF A WIFE,"""But your piano!"" he said, with regret overreaching his appreciation of"
2629,STORY OF A WIFE,her sacrifice.
2630,STORY OF A WIFE,
2631,STORY OF A WIFE,"""Let it go,"" she merrily replied. ""I could not play worth listening"

2634,STORY OF A WIFE,
2635,STORY OF A WIFE,Next day the balance of the debt was borrowed upon the security of the
2636,STORY OF A WIFE,"western deed, and Henry Woodruff was a free man once more. When the five"
2637,STORY OF A WIFE,"hundred dollars jumped to thousands in a sudden boom, he bought a neat"
2638,STORY OF A WIFE,"home. Here, Margaret, the valued friend, supplied produce from her farm."
2639,STORY OF A WIFE,
2640,STORY OF A WIFE,Eleanor was never quite content till Harry had looked up her two
2641,STORY OF A WIFE,"maligners, and brought them to the pleasant domain where she presided,"
2642,STORY OF A WIFE,and which her painfully awakened energy had helped to buy. In time she
2643,STORY OF A WIFE,"told her secret, and thanked them for that ten minutes' gossip. In time,"

2773,A MYSTERY,

2777,A MYSTERY,
2778,A MYSTERY,Richard Temple was not mistaken. A little after midnight the watchers
2779,A MYSTERY,"heard a noise as of sawing, or filing. Peering from an upper window they"
2780,A MYSTERY,"located the sound at the parlor shutter, and soon discerned the figure"
2781,A MYSTERY,of a man in a crouching attitude. Swiftly and noiselessly the young men
2782,A MYSTERY,"stole down and out by a back door, and were creeping upon the burglar to"
2783,A MYSTERY,"capture him, when a short, quick bark from the house dog startled the"
2784,A MYSTERY,"man, who fled precipitately. The pursuers fired, but it was too dark to"
2785,A MYSTERY,see beyond a few yards.
2786,A MYSTERY,
2787,A MYSTERY,"The ladies, aroused and alarmed, were soon reassured, but persisted in"
2788,A MYSTERY,sharing the remainder of the vigil.
2789,A MYSTERY,
2790,A MYSTERY,"Early next morning, leaving the servants to infer that they were bound"
2791,A MYSTERY,"upon a berry excursion, the little party set out, Richard bearing the"
2792,A MYSTERY,"mosaic box, the girls carrying other valuables, and Lawrence armed with"
2793,A MYSTERY,"a larger wooden box and a pick. Their destination was Dry Thicket,"
2794,A MYSTERY,so called from the exceeding dryness of the earth beneath the almost
2795,A MYSTERY,impenetrable trees of native growth. These trees were so closely
2796,A MYSTERY,"interlaced by a tough vine peculiar to the soil, that it was necessary"
2797,A MYSTERY,"to cut one's way, or force it by dint of strength."
2798,A MYSTERY,
2799,A MYSTERY,In order to accomplish this feat the ladies had donned homespun dresses
2800,A MYSTERY,"kept for such excursions, and the gentlemen were suitably provided."
2801,A MYSTERY,Winding through an arable field they descended the narrow path that led
2802,A MYSTERY,"into the thicket, and were soon pushing and cutting their way against"
2803,A MYSTERY,the stout lattice of vines. When far into the interior they found
2804,A MYSTERY,themselves in a natural arbor free from undergrowth and utterly
2805,A MYSTERY,"secluded. A fallen log afforded a seat for the ladies, and the"
2806,A MYSTERY,custodians of the box at once proceeded to bury their treasures of gold
2807,A MYSTERY,"and plate, silver and jewels. An hour sufficed for the task. When"
2808,A MYSTERY,"scattering, dry leaves over the fresh earth the party returned to Lee"
2809,A MYSTERY,Villa somewhat the worse for wear.
2810,A MYSTERY,
2811,A MYSTERY,"""Until these dangerous invaders shall have left the community, or are"
2812,A MYSTERY,"arrested, I think we should arm the negro men on the plantation and be"
2813,A MYSTERY,"prepared for possible surprises,"" were Richard Temple's parting words,"
2814,A MYSTERY,"as he took leave for Columbus, twenty miles distant."
2815,A MYSTERY,
2816,A MYSTERY,"Villula was altogether inland, and hence an easy prey to outlaws. The"
2817,A MYSTERY,"nearest railway station was at Silver Run, two miles away. The first"
2818,A MYSTERY,"down train brought a hasty letter from Temple, stating that he and"
2819,A MYSTERY,Lawrence Lee were detailed to convey four fine horses belonging to Major
2820,A MYSTERY,"Lester, to a place of safety, and that the threatened section had been"
2821,A MYSTERY,well picketed.
2822,A MYSTERY,
2823,A MYSTERY,"There was at once a general hiding out of valuables, live stock and"
2824,A MYSTERY,"provisions, the numerous swamps and thickets affording secure harbors"
2825,A MYSTERY,all over the section. A reign of terror existed during the next two
2826,A MYSTERY,"weeks. The dreaded marauders were at work, and stories were rife of"
2827,A MYSTERY,"insult to women, and outrages upon men whom they hung by the neck till"
2828,A MYSTERY,almost dead unless they revealed the whereabouts of their treasures.
2829,A MYSTERY,Thus far they had baffled the vigilance of the authorities. The country
2830,A MYSTERY,"was thinly settled, and the peculiar features of the landscape afforded"
2831,A MYSTERY,facilities both for concealment and escape.
2832,A MYSTERY,
2833,A MYSTERY,One evening the ladies of Lee Villa sat watching the resplendent sunset
2834,A MYSTERY,"from the front piazza, when a ragged, barefoot urchin came up the road"
2835,A MYSTERY,turning somersaults with surprising agility. He righted himself up at
2836,A MYSTERY,"the gate, then entered and sidled rather doubtfully toward the group."
2837,A MYSTERY,
2838,A MYSTERY,"""Here's somethin' fur Miss Lee. Be you her?"""
2839,A MYSTERY,
2840,A MYSTERY,"""Yes,"" said Netta, receiving a dirty note from the boy's dusty fingers."

2843,A MYSTERY,"""He gave it to me--he did,"" nodding his head down the road, ""an' he"

2845,A MYSTERY,as he darted away again at his evolutions.

3446,A LOVE STORY,attempted to spring up.
3447,A LOVE STORY,
3448,A LOVE STORY,"""Be careful,"" gently remonstrated the doctor, laying a detaining hand"
3449,A LOVE STORY,"upon her. ""Tell me--are you hurt anywhere?"""
3450,A LOVE STORY,
3451,A LOVE STORY,"""I don't know--I think not--oh! who are you? Where am I? Where are the"
3452,A LOVE STORY,"others? Were they killed? Oh! it was too horrible!"" and the agitated"
3453,A LOVE STORY,speaker burst into a passion of tears so violent as to alarm her
3454,A LOVE STORY,watchers.
3455,A LOVE STORY,
3456,A LOVE STORY,"Leaving her to the housekeeper, Dr. Gardner quickly prepared and"
3457,A LOVE STORY,"administered a soothing potion. Then, enjoining absolute quiet, he"
3458,A LOVE STORY,"drew the blinds, and proceeded downstairs to learn of the ill-fated"
3459,A LOVE STORY,"companions of his patient. The crowd still lingered about the spot,"
3460,A LOVE STORY,although the bodies had been removed to await a claimant. Nothing was
3461,A LOVE STORY,known except that the balloon had ascended that morning from one of the
3462,A LOVE STORY,"city squares, and that, as frequently happened, a party of young people"
3463,A LOVE STORY,had gone up to get a bird's eye view of the metropolis. Who they were
3464,A LOVE STORY,did not yet appear.
3465,A LOVE STORY,
3466,A LOVE STORY,"Several hours passed, and still the rescued girl slept the dreamless"
3467,A LOVE STORY,sleep induced by the nervous shock and the narcotic draught of the
3468,A LOVE STORY,doctor. Patiently the housekeeper sat and watched.
3469,A LOVE STORY,
3470,A LOVE STORY,"As twilight fell, she gave a sigh and opened her large eyes in surprise"
3471,A LOVE STORY,upon the strange face beside her. Taking advantage of the opportune
3472,A LOVE STORY,"moment, Mrs. Buford removed the pongee walking suit from the drowsy"
3473,A LOVE STORY,"girl, and then gently enfolding her in a soft white wrapper, the kind"
3474,A LOVE STORY,"matron assisted her to the bed which had been prepared, the girl"
3475,A LOVE STORY,"submitting with a bewildered look of questioning wonder, and finally"
3476,A LOVE STORY,sinking back gratefully into slumber.
3477,A LOVE STORY,
3478,A LOVE STORY,And here Weldon Gardner came before retiring for the night.
3479,A LOVE STORY,
3480,A LOVE STORY,"Softly touching the delicate wrist in its dainty frill, he noted the"
3481,A LOVE STORY,somewhat fitful pulsations of the disturbed life-centers. Bending above
3482,A LOVE STORY,"the tell-tale heart-beats, his practiced ear assured him that ere long"
3483,A LOVE STORY,the deep repose of his charge would effectually restore her to health.
3484,A LOVE STORY,
3485,A LOVE STORY,"How like chiseled marble she looked, lying there in her absolute"
3486,A LOVE STORY,"helplessness beneath his stranger gaze! How pure the white brow, with"
3487,A LOVE STORY,its clustering rings of glossy hair! How exquisitely fine the white hand
3488,A LOVE STORY,to which the dimples of babyhood yet clung! How classic the contour of
3489,A LOVE STORY,"her face, into which already the warm hue of health was creeping! A"
3490,A LOVE STORY,heavy sigh escaped him as he noted each perfection of outline. Who was
3491,A LOVE STORY,this lovely stranger? And what could she be to him?
3492,A LOVE STORY,
3493,A LOVE STORY,"""Why was I ever such a dupe?"" he said in his heart. ""Fettered--fettered"
3494,A LOVE STORY,"for life!"""
3495,A LOVE STORY,
3496,A LOVE STORY,But suddenly realizing that except in his professional capacity he had
3497,A LOVE STORY,"no right thus to intrude upon her slumbers, the young physician turned"
3498,A LOVE STORY,from the enchanting picture.
3499,A LOVE STORY,
3500,A LOVE STORY,"""How is she now, sir?"" respectfully inquired the housekeeper."
3501,A LOVE STORY,
3502,A LOVE STORY,"""Fairly well,"" he replied cheerfully; ""I do not think she is hurt,"
3503,A LOVE STORY,"except a few bruises, which we must look after. She was thrown pretty"
3504,A LOVE STORY,hard against that tree. To-morrow she will be able to give an account of
3505,A LOVE STORY,herself. We can do nothing toward finding her friends before that time.
3506,A LOVE STORY,"Call, if she should become restless,"" and the young man retired to his"
3507,A LOVE STORY,"own apartment, there to ponder deeply, as he had never before pondered"
3508,A LOVE STORY,in his life.
3509,A LOVE STORY,
3510,A LOVE STORY,Some days later the following letter was posted by Weldon Gardner:
3511,A LOVE STORY,
3512,A LOVE STORY,"NEW YORK, September 20, 1879."
3513,A LOVE STORY,
3514,A LOVE STORY,"""My Dear Aunt:--"
3515,A LOVE STORY,
3516,A LOVE STORY,"""Your kind letter reminds me that never, in all these years of boyhood"
3517,A LOVE STORY,"grown ripe, has duty come to me in as repulsive a form as now, I tell"
3518,A LOVE STORY,"you, shocked as you may feel when you read the words, that I would"
3519,A LOVE STORY,rather put a bullet through my head than meet Evelyn Howard at this
3520,A LOVE STORY,time! Why couldn't she stay in England? And what cursed folly induced
3521,A LOVE STORY,"my parents to thus bind me for life to one I had never seen? True, I"
3522,A LOVE STORY,submitted. But you know with what an appeal my dying mother besought
3523,A LOVE STORY,"my compliance, and what could I do? I cared for no one else. How was"
3524,A LOVE STORY,I to foresee that the tie would ever be so intensely galling?
3525,A LOVE STORY,
3526,A LOVE STORY,"""I know all that you would say about honor, manhood, and all the"
3527,A LOVE STORY,category of virtues. I know them all. Nor am I willing to act the
3528,A LOVE STORY,scoundrel just yet. But I must have time; I can _not_ marry that
3529,A LOVE STORY,girl now. Nor will I consent to meet her yet. Let her think I am out
3530,A LOVE STORY,"of town, sick, busy, _dead_; anything, till I can screw my courage"
3531,A LOVE STORY,to the sticking point.
3532,A LOVE STORY,
3533,A LOVE STORY,"""About the balloon tragedy--yes, you heard correctly of my figuring"
3534,A LOVE STORY,"in the matter. The girl is Miss Lina Dent, of Brooklyn, and I am"
3535,A LOVE STORY,"happy to report that she is entirely recovered, though deeply afflicted"
3536,A LOVE STORY,"at the fearful death of her friends. It seems that they had, in a"
3537,A LOVE STORY,"spirit of fun, gone up in the balloon, feeling confident that their"
3538,A LOVE STORY,"adventure was, to say the least, of somewhat doubtful propriety."
3539,A LOVE STORY,"They did not think of danger. The cowardly desertion of the æronaut,"
3540,A LOVE STORY,"as soon as he could leap to a roof in safety, precipitated their fall."
3541,A LOVE STORY,
3542,A LOVE STORY,"""The young victims, Lucien and Maggie Taylor, were too much frightened"
3543,A LOVE STORY,to hold to their frail support. Their tragic fate has plunged an
3544,A LOVE STORY,excellent household into mourning. Bitterly my new acquaintance
3545,A LOVE STORY,lamented her folly in consenting to the excursion; but how can a man
3546,A LOVE STORY,in his senses add to her condemnation when she looks through such
3547,A LOVE STORY,"eyes, and speaks with such lips? Not I, I assure you."
3548,A LOVE STORY,
3549,A LOVE STORY,"""Miss Dent is visiting a relative in Brooklyn, and in my character of"
3550,A LOVE STORY,"physician, I have been kindly received. The strangest part of it all"
3551,A LOVE STORY,is the odd way that girl looked at me when she knew enough to look
3552,A LOVE STORY,rationally at anybody; and her obstinate persistence in leaving my
3553,A LOVE STORY,house before she was fit to go. And it was all I could do to induce
3554,A LOVE STORY,"her to see me again. But her cousin was quite cordial, and now I may"
3555,A LOVE STORY,claim to have established an easy footing at the house. But about
3556,A LOVE STORY,"Evelyn Howard--don't, my dear aunt, if you have a spark of mercy,"
3557,A LOVE STORY,"require me to see her now."""
3558,A LOVE STORY,
3559,A LOVE STORY,
3560,A LOVE STORY,*       *       *       *       *
3561,A LOVE STORY,
3562,A LOVE STORY,"A month passed by, and October, in glorious tints of autumnal beauty,"
3563,A LOVE STORY,shed its light over the city. In a handsome drawing-room on Brooklyn
3564,A LOVE STORY,Heights sat Weldon Gardner and Lina Dent. The young girl wore a soft
3565,A LOVE STORY,"white dress, and her figure was replete with roseate health and beauty."
3566,A LOVE STORY,
3567,A LOVE STORY,"The young physician was pleading strongly and earnestly, gazing into the"
3568,A LOVE STORY,eloquent eyes before him as if his very life hung upon their favor.
3569,A LOVE STORY,
3570,A LOVE STORY,"""But I know so little of you, Dr. Gardner,"" was her remonstrance in"
3571,A LOVE STORY,"answer to his ardent suit, ""true you have earned my life-long"
3572,A LOVE STORY,"gratitude--"""
3573,A LOVE STORY,
3574,A LOVE STORY,"""Don't mention that, if you have any regard for me,"" he interrupted, in"
3575,A LOVE STORY,a sort of disdain.
3576,A LOVE STORY,
3577,A LOVE STORY,"""Yes,"" she urged, ""I must mention it. To you I owe my life, and perhaps,"
3578,A LOVE STORY,"my reason. Of course I know you in all points of family, position, and"
3579,A LOVE STORY,professional success; but your own true self--how can I know that you
3580,A LOVE STORY,will secure my happiness? Is there nothing you can tell me of yourself
3581,A LOVE STORY,"which will reassure me?"""
3582,A LOVE STORY,
3583,A LOVE STORY,"And the bright, honest look of her eyes robbed her plain words all"
3584,A LOVE STORY,possible sting.
3585,A LOVE STORY,
3586,A LOVE STORY,"""First, tell me that you love me,"" he argued, ""let me know that it would"
3587,A LOVE STORY,be sweet to you to place your happiness in my keeping. At least you can
3588,A LOVE STORY,"do this. You know if you love me."""
3589,A LOVE STORY,
3590,A LOVE STORY,She listened with averted look.
3591,A LOVE STORY,
3592,A LOVE STORY,"""And if I confess that I love you,"" she said at length, in a low voice;"
3593,A LOVE STORY,"""if I do this, would it not be mockery to learn, when too late, that I"
3594,A LOVE STORY,"had made a mistake?"""
3595,A LOVE STORY,
3596,A LOVE STORY,"""But, in heaven's name, Lina, what can you mean? Why do you doubt me?"
3597,A LOVE STORY,"What is there to tell? I could have no secrets--"""
3598,A LOVE STORY,
3599,A LOVE STORY,Then there rushed to his memory with a force that sent the blood to his
3600,A LOVE STORY,"brow and almost took his breath, the conviction that he _had_ a"
3601,A LOVE STORY,secret from her--that he _was_ deceiving her--that it was unmanly
3602,A LOVE STORY,to seek her love with a lie on his lips. For a brief season his
3603,A LOVE STORY,"engagement had been forgotten, or ignored. He had hugged to his breast"
3604,A LOVE STORY,with unreasoning apathy the theory that the present was enough to
3605,A LOVE STORY,consider--that the future must care for itself--that once his promised
3606,A LOVE STORY,"wife, Lina Dent should be his if all the world conspired against it. But"
3607,A LOVE STORY,now came the hated thought that Evelyn Howard stood between him and the
3608,A LOVE STORY,precious one who had been his day-star since the night when he had
3609,A LOVE STORY,nursed her back to life.
3610,A LOVE STORY,
3611,A LOVE STORY,"Starting up, he strode back and forth, not noting the pale cheeks and"
3612,A LOVE STORY,startled eyes of the girl who watched him in ill-repressed anxiety.
3613,A LOVE STORY,
3614,A LOVE STORY,"At length, sitting down beside her, he seized her soft fingers with a"
3615,A LOVE STORY,grasp of which he was hardly aware. Then instantly relaxing the rigor
3616,A LOVE STORY,"of his clasp, he pleaded:"
3617,A LOVE STORY,
3618,A LOVE STORY,"""Let me hold this pure little hand while I confess to you, my only love,"
3619,A LOVE STORY,that your clear eyes have read my soul--that I have deceived you--that
3620,A LOVE STORY,I love you beyond all else this world contains; but that the most cruel
3621,A LOVE STORY,"fate man ever before suffered, keeps me from you, unless, indeed, your"
3622,A LOVE STORY,"love will help me to remove the barrier."""
3623,A LOVE STORY,
3624,A LOVE STORY,"And while the young girl listened, with drooping head, he told her of"
3625,A LOVE STORY,his hated engagement--of the painful circumstances that had betrayed him
3626,A LOVE STORY,into compliance.
3627,A LOVE STORY,
3628,A LOVE STORY,"""But I never dreamed of this sort of Nemesis! I could not have been in"
3629,A LOVE STORY,"my senses to thus barter my freedom forever."""
3630,A LOVE STORY,
3631,A LOVE STORY,"Slowly withdrawing her hand, the girl said, still in the same low tones:"
3632,A LOVE STORY,
3633,A LOVE STORY,"""And you do not love your betrothed?"""
3634,A LOVE STORY,
3635,A LOVE STORY,"""Love her?"" he echoed. ""I tell you, Lina, I have never even seen her."
3636,A LOVE STORY,Her people have been abroad for an age. She was in New York a few weeks
3637,A LOVE STORY,"ago and, I understand, took offense at my continued absence from her"
3638,A LOVE STORY,"side, and went back to England. This is what she left for me;"" and"
3639,A LOVE STORY,plunging his hand into his breast pocket he selected from his note-case
3640,A LOVE STORY,"a fragrant little billet-doux, formally desiring Dr. Gardner to explain"
3641,A LOVE STORY,his strange conduct at his leisure--that the next opportunity granted
3642,A LOVE STORY,him of seeing Evelyn Howard must be of his own seeking.
3643,A LOVE STORY,
3644,A LOVE STORY,"There was a pause after the reading of this aggrieved, dignified little"
3645,A LOVE STORY,message.
3646,A LOVE STORY,
3647,A LOVE STORY,"""And can you, as a gentleman of honor, reconcile your neglect of the"
3648,A LOVE STORY,"writer?"" asked Lina Dent, in a voice in which a cadence of scorn"
3649,A LOVE STORY,involuntarily sounded.
3650,A LOVE STORY,
3651,A LOVE STORY,"""Honor! Can't you see that honor was what kept me from her? Such honor"
3652,A LOVE STORY,as a man feels when he knows that he is poised between a Scylla and a
3653,A LOVE STORY,"Charybdis of desperate fatality?"""
3654,A LOVE STORY,
3655,A LOVE STORY,"""There can be but one answer to all this, Dr. Gardner,"" the girl replied"
3656,A LOVE STORY,"with proud dignity. ""It would ill become me to sit in judgment on you"
3657,A LOVE STORY,after what I have received at your hands; but you will acknowledge that
3658,A LOVE STORY,it was cruelly inconsiderate to seek my love while a barrier such as
3659,A LOVE STORY,this existed. How do I know that you will not love your betrothed after
3660,A LOVE STORY,"you have seen her?"""
3661,A LOVE STORY,
3662,A LOVE STORY,"""Love her--love any other than you, my beautiful, peerless one? Do not"
3663,A LOVE STORY,torture me with such a supposition. I care nothing for Evelyn Howard;
3664,A LOVE STORY,I do not know her; I do not care to know her; nor is she in the least
3665,A LOVE STORY,"dependent upon me for happiness. She has vast wealth, and can command"
3666,A LOVE STORY,"whatever fate she chooses."""
3667,A LOVE STORY,
3668,A LOVE STORY,"""But wealth cannot buy happiness,"" she sadly replied, ""and our course"
3669,A LOVE STORY,is clear. I can see you no more till you have met your betrothed and
3670,A LOVE STORY,"received your dismissal--or,""--and her clear cheek paled again--""made up"
3671,A LOVE STORY,your mind to fulfill your promise to her. Farewell! I thank you for your
3672,A LOVE STORY,"unwise devotion to me, but I can see you no more."""
3673,A LOVE STORY,
3674,A LOVE STORY,"""Oh, Lina, do not doom me to this total separation. Why it seems an"
3675,A LOVE STORY,eternity. Where and when can I see you again? Why didn't I go to that
3676,A LOVE STORY,"girl when she was here? Fool, coward that I was! And now I cannot leave"
3677,A LOVE STORY,"New York. Grant me some respite, my love--I cannot live without you!"""
3678,A LOVE STORY,
3679,A LOVE STORY,But much as she sympathized with him she was firm; and when Weldon
3680,A LOVE STORY,"Gardner left the house, with despair tugging at his heart, the only ray"
3681,A LOVE STORY,of sunshine that pierced the gloom was the conviction that she did love
3682,A LOVE STORY,"him--that should anything occur to separate them forever, her heart"
3683,A LOVE STORY,"would plead strongly for him, and her love would strive with his to"
3684,A LOVE STORY,overcome the barrier.
3685,A LOVE STORY,
3686,A LOVE STORY,*       *       *       *       *
3687,A LOVE STORY,
3688,A LOVE STORY,"Months went by, and still Evelyn Howard eluded Weldon Gardner's pursuit."
3689,A LOVE STORY,Bitterly was he punished for his culpable neglect of her. In vain he
3690,A LOVE STORY,wrote letters urging her to come to New York. She was traveling with
3691,A LOVE STORY,"friends and declined to change her course. He followed her to London,"
3692,A LOVE STORY,to Paris. In vain! She was ever just before him on his journey: always
3693,A LOVE STORY,"missing, never meeting him. Then he wrote to Lina Dent, beseeching her"
3694,A LOVE STORY,"to relent, since he had done all in his power to carry out her wishes."
3695,A LOVE STORY,She did not reply. Then in sullen despair he gave up the pursuit. He
3696,A LOVE STORY,"carefully avoided going out except to see patients, declined all"
3697,A LOVE STORY,"invitations, and took solitary refuge in the stern exactions of duty."
3698,A LOVE STORY,
3699,A LOVE STORY,As the year drew to a close he noticed in the list of arrivals from
3700,A LOVE STORY,"Europe, Miss Evelyn Howard and her party; and among the personals he saw"
3701,A LOVE STORY,that the beautiful Miss Howard would appear at Governor B's reception on
3702,A LOVE STORY,"the next evening. He had received cards to this party, and now, with the"
3703,A LOVE STORY,"fierce desire to end his torture reawakened, he prepared to accept the"
3704,A LOVE STORY,invitation. As he entered the brilliant rooms his eye fell upon the form
3705,A LOVE STORY,"and face of Lina Dent, attired in an exquisite costume, and looking far"
3706,A LOVE STORY,more radiant than in his wildest dreams he had ever pictured her.
3707,A LOVE STORY,
3708,A LOVE STORY,"Feasting upon her loveliness, with eyes hungry in their wistfulness, he"
3709,A LOVE STORY,was about to approach her when she suddenly looked toward him and their
3710,A LOVE STORY,eyes met. He caught the quick flash of feeling; he knew that he was
3711,A LOVE STORY,still beloved! But even as he drank in the delicious confirmation of his
3712,A LOVE STORY,"hopes, she passed him without recognition, and he knew that she would"
3713,A LOVE STORY,not break her vow--that she would not meet him till he had fulfilled her
3714,A LOVE STORY,"conditions. Too miserable to seek Miss Howard in the throng, the young"
3715,A LOVE STORY,"physician pleaded an urgent call to a patient, and left his host almost"
3716,A LOVE STORY,before he had fairly entered upon the festivities.
3717,A LOVE STORY,
3718,A LOVE STORY,"One evening, soon after the last fearful disappointment, Dr. Gardner"
3719,A LOVE STORY,"received a note asking him to come to a certain number on Fifth Avenue,"
3720,A LOVE STORY,and there he should meet Evelyn Howard. She inferred that he had had
3721,A LOVE STORY,"ample time to learn if he really desired to form her acquaintance, and"
3722,A LOVE STORY,she was ready now to see him.
3723,A LOVE STORY,
3724,A LOVE STORY,"Tearing the paper to atoms in sudden irritation and setting his teeth,"
3725,A LOVE STORY,"the young physician was soon at the appointed place, an elegant"
3726,A LOVE STORY,"brown-stone mansion, quite familiar to his eyes in his drives about"
3727,A LOVE STORY,the city.
3728,A LOVE STORY,
3729,A LOVE STORY,He was not left long in suspense. There was a sound of rapid steps
3730,A LOVE STORY,"descending the stairs, with a frou-frou of silken skirts, and in a"
3731,A LOVE STORY,"moment Lina Dent stood before him, her face aglow with a proud light"
3732,A LOVE STORY,"he had never seen there, and her hands extended in glad welcome."
3733,A LOVE STORY,
3734,A LOVE STORY,"""You, Lina! You here? You have relented? This is too much happiness!"""
3735,A LOVE STORY,
3736,A LOVE STORY,"Catching both soft white hands in his, he bent his lips to them, full of"
3737,A LOVE STORY,the rapture he could not speak. He forgot to wonder why she was there.
3738,A LOVE STORY,He forgot everything but the love in her eyes and the joyous ring of her
3739,A LOVE STORY,voice.
3740,A LOVE STORY,
3741,A LOVE STORY,Ere they could be seated the door again opened and admitted an elderly
3742,A LOVE STORY,"lady, who approached smiling."
3743,A LOVE STORY,
3744,A LOVE STORY,"""My dear aunt!"" exclaimed the young lover. ""You, too? This _is_ a"
3745,A LOVE STORY,"surprise! What does it all mean? How did you get here, and when?"""
3746,A LOVE STORY,
3747,A LOVE STORY,The ladies stood smiling at each other and gazing upon him with a
3748,A LOVE STORY,significance that indeed clamored for explanation.
3749,A LOVE STORY,
3750,A LOVE STORY,"""Weldon, is it possible you do not guess?"" asked his aunt."
3751,A LOVE STORY,
3752,A LOVE STORY,"""What? Why, what do you mean? I am all bewildered!"" he exclaimed,"
3753,A LOVE STORY,looking from one to the other till a faint glimmer of the truth began
3754,A LOVE STORY,to appear through the mists.
3755,A LOVE STORY,
3756,A LOVE STORY,"""Stupid boy!"" again emphasized the lady, ""whom did you come here to"
3757,A LOVE STORY,"see?"""
3758,A LOVE STORY,
3759,A LOVE STORY,"Quickly glancing at the beautiful, radiant, still-smiling face of the"
3760,A LOVE STORY,"young girl, and then at the impressive features of the elder lady,"
3761,A LOVE STORY,"Weldon Gardner, with bated breath and a dazed expression in his startled"
3762,A LOVE STORY,"eyes, exclaimed:"
3763,A LOVE STORY,
3764,A LOVE STORY,"""You--are--Evelyn Howard--you?"""
3765,A LOVE STORY,
3766,A LOVE STORY,"""Exactly so. Doctor Gardner--Evelina Dent Howard--at your service!"""
3767,A LOVE STORY,
3768,A LOVE STORY,"As she spoke, she placed her hand in his, and asked, in the liquid tones"
3769,A LOVE STORY,"whose cadences he so well remembered, ""Have you been punished enough for"
3770,A LOVE STORY,"your unknightly scorn of the girl you condemned without trial?"""
3771,A LOVE STORY,
3772,A LOVE STORY,"""Oh, forgive!"" he pleaded, drawing her to a seat beside him. ""I see it"
3773,A LOVE STORY,all now. What a dolt you must have thought me! How could you ever have
3774,A LOVE STORY,"tolerated me?"""
3775,A LOVE STORY,
3776,A LOVE STORY,"""There is the conspirator,"" archly said Evelyn, pointing to Mrs. Duke."
3777,A LOVE STORY,"""She it was who enabled me to deceive you. I wrote to her immediately"
3778,A LOVE STORY,"upon leaving your house for my cousin's, in Brooklyn, and she at once"
3779,A LOVE STORY,"devised the scheme that I have found so hard to carry out. Meanwhile,"
3780,A LOVE STORY,"she never lost sight of you."""
3781,A LOVE STORY,
3782,A LOVE STORY,"It was long before the necessary explanations were exhausted, and when"
3783,A LOVE STORY,the new day dawned no happier man proudly entered upon his duties than
3784,A LOVE STORY,did Weldon Gardner.

3786,A LOVE STORY,*       *       *       *       *
3787,A LOVE STORY,
3788,A LOVE STORY,It is upon a soft September afternoon that we last see Dr. Gardner and
3789,A LOVE STORY,his lovely wife. Within a snug little arbor beside the lake in Central
3790,A LOVE STORY,"Park the two sit side by side, watching the idly-floating pleasure"

3814,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"Partridge, as the portly figure of Mr. Hezekiah Lighthouse appeared in"

3830,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Oh, she--why she's allers the picture o' health. Here she comes now."""
3831,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3832,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"As she spoke, a fair, rosy-cheeked girl entered the cheerful room, with"
3833,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"her arms full of painting materials. These she deposited upon the table,"
3834,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,then dutifully greeted the visitor.
3835,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3836,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""An' how do you like them new fol-de-rols, Cicely Ann?"" inquired"
3837,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"Hezekiah, eyeing askance the collection."
3838,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3839,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"The fol-de-rols consisted of some wooden plaques of different sizes,"
3840,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,which the new art craze had brought to the widow's cottage.
3841,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3842,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""She's gettin' along right nice, I think,"" replied the widow, looking"
3843,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"proudly at her one chick. ""You see, she's a lot o' darnin' an' one thing"
3844,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"another to do, but she finds time for her landskips and things."""
3845,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3846,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Well, mebbe so,"" assented Hezekiah grudgingly. ""For my part there's"

3848,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"money in her pocket, besides."""
3849,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3850,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""La, Mr. Lightus,"" said the widow deprecatingly, ""spinnin' an' weavin's"

3852,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"fashion, you know."""
3853,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3854,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,Cicely's red lip curled in scorn as she applied herself vigorously
3855,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"to her plaque, where the inevitable girl with muff and umbrella was"
3856,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,stumbling into a snowdrift.
3857,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3858,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"Hezekiah picked up the widow's daily paper which, by the way, he largely"
3859,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"depended on for the news. Silence reigned for a while, save for the"
3860,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"rustle of the sheet. The click-clack of the widow's knitting needles,"
3861,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"and the rapid plying of Cicely's brush, were varied at last by the girl"
3862,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,surreptitiously pulling a note out of her jaunty apron pocket.
3863,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3864,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"As she read it a smile broke over the dimpled features, and in a moment"
3865,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,more she pushed the table from her and left the room. Swiftly she sped
3866,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"to the big apple tree where her trystings were held with Rufus, her"
3867,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,playmate and lover.
3868,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3869,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"Hezekiah slowly raised his head, and laying down the paper, said"

3872,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,

3881,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3882,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"Another silence, during which the visitor carefully noted the land,"
3883,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"stock and crop items in the paper, then took his leave. But not till he"
3884,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"had cast a lingering look behind and said: ""This is about the"
3885,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"comfortablest place a feller could drop into, in my opinion."""
3886,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3887,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,It was some minutes after when the truant Cicely re-entered the little
3888,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"keeping-room, her cheeks and eyes bright with happiness."
3889,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3890,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Oh, mother, wish me joy! Rufus has asked me to be his wife."""
3891,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3892,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Mercy on us, Cicely!"" exclaimed the widow in a sort of terror, ""and you"
3893,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"want to marry him?"""
3894,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3895,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Of course I do,"" proudly said the girl; ""and I mean to marry him."""

3897,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Oh, Cicely, my child! and what will Mr. Lightus do--him that's been"
3898,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"comin' here so patient, off an' on?"""
3899,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3900,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Mr. Lighthouse!"" disdainfully echoed the girl. ""Do you suppose I would"
3901,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"have that old goose--old enough to be my grandfather!"""
3902,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3903,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Old goose! Fie, Cicely, to talk so disrespectful of your pa's best"
3904,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,friend. He's well-to-do an' has got the finest place in the county.
3905,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"Think how nice we'd be fixed, child. We'd never have to work no more,"""
3906,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,and the widow sighed as the girl looked into her face for the
3907,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,congratulations she expected in vain.
3908,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3909,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Well, mother, I can't help it. I am willing to work and so is Rufus. He"
3910,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,is as industrious and steady as the day is long. I shouldn't mind having
3911,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"Mr. Lighthouse for an uncle, but husband--pshaw!"" and the pretty"
3912,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,features screwed themselves into a comical grimace.
3913,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3914,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Child, child, I'm disappointed and no mistake. Here's that man's been"

3917,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"There's that moggidge on the house, too. But that's allers the"
3918,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"way--troubles don't never come single,"" and the sigh became a whimper."
3919,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3920,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Now, don't you worry, mother,"" said Cicely, clasping her arms about the"
3921,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"still fair neck, ""don't worry; we will come out all right, mortgage and"
3922,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"all."""
3923,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3924,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"Taking fresh courage, the widow again pressed the claims of the portly"
3925,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"wooer, but what chance had she against the combined powers of young love"
3926,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,and the daughter's stronger nature.
3927,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3928,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"Time passed. Almost every evening found Hezekiah at the cottage, but"
3929,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"though persistent, things did not apparently make much progress. At last"
3930,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,the stiffness of the customary interviews seemed to break.
3931,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3932,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Mis' Patridge,"" he said, getting very red in the face and awkward as to"
3933,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"hands and feet, ""Cicely Ann gits worse every day. Ain't there no chance"
3934,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"of her puttin' up with me at all?"""
3935,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3936,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Why, yes, I reckon so,"" bashfully said the widow. ""She's young and"
3937,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"foolish, you know. You can't expect gals to be sensible and sober down"
3938,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"like they will when they get holt of some wise person tha'll train 'em."""
3939,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3940,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Well,"" sighed the wooer, ""I guess I might as well stop comin'. 'Taint"
3941,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"no use to be forever worritin' after anything. I did think, howsomever,"
3942,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,it 'ud be sorter nice to have us four live together. Young folks makes a
3943,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"house kinder lively. But I don't git on, somehow; so I guess I might as"
3944,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"well hang up my fiddle an' quit."" And the ancient wooer slowly rose to"
3945,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,his full height.
3946,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3947,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Us four!"" repeated the petrified widow, mouth and eyes open to their"

3949,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3950,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Yes--us four,"" continued Hezekiah. ""I was thinkin', you know, that"

3955,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3956,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""La, Mr. Lightus, how you do astonish me,"" faintly ejaculated the"
3957,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"flushed widow, her comely face crimson to the roots of her soft brown"
3958,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,hair.
3959,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3960,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""You don't say!"" exclaimed the rapidly enlightened Hezekiah, rousing"
3961,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"to something like animation. ""Did you think--didn't you know--well,"
3962,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"I declare, I don't actually believe you did. Now ain't it a puzzle,"
3963,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"begad!"""
3964,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3965,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"While he jerked out his amazed sentences, his companion, fairly overcome"
3966,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"with the revelation that dawned upon her for the first time, buried her"
3967,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,face in her hands.
3968,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3969,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Mis' Patridge,"" timidly said the agitated wooer, approaching nearer,"
3970,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""you don't say--that is, do you mean to say that if Cicely Ann could"
3971,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"like me well enough to not be sassy around the house, an' keepin' you"
3972,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"oncomfortable about it, you an' me could hitch on an' be pardners? You"
3973,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"don't mean it now, do you?"""
3974,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3975,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"""Mean it!"" murmured the widow, her fair cheeks aglow with"

3978,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3979,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,But at this juncture the rejuvenated wooer ventured to clasp his rough

3981,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3982,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"At this juncture, also, Cicely and Rufus happened in, but beat a hasty"
3983,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"and giggling retreat, as they rapidly took in the situation."
3984,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3985,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,All's well that ends well. Hezekiah Lighthouse married the Widow
3986,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,"Partridge, and set young Rufus up in business. As a father the spirited"
3987,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,Cicely yielded him the respect and affection he deserved.
3988,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,
3989,A FIRESIDE SKETCH,She made but one stipulation. On the marriage morn she whispered the

4004,A PASTORAL,
4005,A PASTORAL,"A few bold, rapid strokes transferred a pretty bit of rural landscape to"
4006,A PASTORAL,"the canvas, and this much gained, the amateur artist lit a fine Havana"
4007,A PASTORAL,and lazily drifted off again into reverie. His thoughts were not of
4008,A PASTORAL,a pleasant nature. Why couldn't a man do as he liked in this world?
4009,A PASTORAL,"Here the particular man in his mind--to-wit his own agreeable self,"
4010,A PASTORAL,had devoted his twenty-four years to acquiring sundry dazzling

4025,A PASTORAL,"himself for life to any girl he had never seen, especially old"
4026,A PASTORAL,"Thornton's daughter, who seemed so willing to jump at him. Not he. In"

4039,A PASTORAL,and a violent start and a glance upward revealed a bewildering little

4089,A PASTORAL,"""Well, I climbed up,"" she admitted. ""I suppose I'll have to jump down."
4090,A PASTORAL,"Reach out your hands,"" she cried, and a sudden rustle showed she was"

4124,A PASTORAL,
4125,A PASTORAL,"""This isn't bad,"" was her sage critcism."
4126,A PASTORAL,
4127,A PASTORAL,"""Didn't you wear a hat, or something?"" he asked, looking around and up"
4128,A PASTORAL,into the tree.
4129,A PASTORAL,
4130,A PASTORAL,"""No--yes--I wore this,"" and pulling from her pocket a large blue square"
4131,A PASTORAL,"of cotton, she tied it under her chin with the utmost naivete."
4132,A PASTORAL,
4133,A PASTORAL,"""It's Aunt Hepsy's,"" she explained. ""There, do you hear that bell?"
4134,A PASTORAL,"That's for dinner,"" and taking a tiny watch from an elf-like pocket, she"
4135,A PASTORAL,"added, ""Only half-past eleven. But, to be sure, we ate breakfast with"
4136,A PASTORAL,"the chickens. It's horrible."""
4137,A PASTORAL,
4138,A PASTORAL,"""Don't you live here?"""
4139,A PASTORAL,
4140,A PASTORAL,"""Live here?"" she echoed. ""No, I'm only visiting. Good-bye, I must go. I"
4141,A PASTORAL,"am much obliged, though,"" and as if the recollection were overpowering,"
4142,A PASTORAL,she again burst out into her ringing laugh.
4143,A PASTORAL,
4144,A PASTORAL,"""It was too funny you didn't see me; and I so scared I was afraid to"
4145,A PASTORAL,"breathe. Good-bye, I hope you will have a good time with your picture."""
4146,A PASTORAL,
4147,A PASTORAL,"""But you are not going to dismiss me, are you? Mayn't I take you home?"""
4148,A PASTORAL,
4149,A PASTORAL,"""Yes, if you like; only you musn't stay long. I've got to do Rollin and"
4150,A PASTORAL,"Plutarch while I'm out here, and can't be bothered."""
4151,A PASTORAL,
4152,A PASTORAL,"With difficulty repressing an explosion, the young man walked beside"
4153,A PASTORAL,"the woodland sprite, with his goods and chattels thrown across his"
4154,A PASTORAL,"shoulders, and found himself falling--yes, tumbling--headlong in love."
4155,A PASTORAL,"Such an airy, fairy, exquisite piece of humanity it had never been his"
4156,A PASTORAL,fortune to behold.
4157,A PASTORAL,
4158,A PASTORAL,"""You are too young to worry your brain with dry old fossils like Rollin"
4159,A PASTORAL,"and Plutarch,"" he said, with what gravity he could."
4160,A PASTORAL,
4161,A PASTORAL,"""I am a person of twenty,"" she affirmed with demure satisfaction, as she"
4162,A PASTORAL,tripped along in a manner quite enchanting.
4163,A PASTORAL,
4164,A PASTORAL,"At the door of the farm-house a fair, motherly face smiled a welcome"
4165,A PASTORAL,"from the border of a spotless cap, then sobered a little at the sight"
4166,A PASTORAL,of a stranger.
4167,A PASTORAL,
4168,A PASTORAL,"""This is Aunt Hepsy,"" simply said Daisy, ""and you are--?"" hesitating."
4169,A PASTORAL,
4170,A PASTORAL,A flush not born of the sunshine mounted to his brow as with swift
4171,A PASTORAL,"thought he saw the shoals ahead, and did not dare reveal his identity."
4172,A PASTORAL,
4173,A PASTORAL,"""John Smith,"" he said, with his natural ease."
4174,A PASTORAL,
4175,A PASTORAL,"""Oh!"" half exclaimed Daisy, upon hearing such a very common name from"
4176,A PASTORAL,"such very uncommon lips; but checking it, and softly humming a tune, she"
4177,A PASTORAL,retired to an inner room to prepare for dinner.
4178,A PASTORAL,
4179,A PASTORAL,This episode was the beginning of elysium for John Smith. Every day saw
4180,A PASTORAL,him at the farm-house. Every day revealed some new charm in the Daisy
4181,A PASTORAL,he had found. She was as industrious and sensible as she was petite and
4182,A PASTORAL,"pretty. Rollin and Plutarch were discarded for modern authors, or for"
4183,A PASTORAL,"simple chit-chat about mamma, papa, and little ones at home."
4184,A PASTORAL,
4185,A PASTORAL,"But when the day came for John Smith to tell his love, he met with a"
4186,A PASTORAL,shock that quite paralyzed his senses.
4187,A PASTORAL,
4188,A PASTORAL,"Looking up with her big blue eyes, she said:"
4189,A PASTORAL,
4190,A PASTORAL,"""You mustn't talk like that; I'm engaged."""
4191,A PASTORAL,
4192,A PASTORAL,"""Engaged?"" he stammered, ""engaged?"""
4193,A PASTORAL,
4194,A PASTORAL,"""Yes, I'm engaged."""
4195,A PASTORAL,
4196,A PASTORAL,"""And to whom? May I ask?"""
4197,A PASTORAL,
4198,A PASTORAL,"""Oh, I can't tell you his name; it's a secret yet. He is a person I"
4199,A PASTORAL,"never saw."""
4200,A PASTORAL,
4201,A PASTORAL,"""Sheer madness!"" was his horrified ejaculation. ""Never saw him, and"
4202,A PASTORAL,"going to marry him?"""
4203,A PASTORAL,
4204,A PASTORAL,"""I promised, you know; I must, if he wants me,"" she said in her"
4205,A PASTORAL,unconcerned way.
4206,A PASTORAL,
4207,A PASTORAL,"""But don't you love _me_, Daisy?"""
4208,A PASTORAL,
4209,A PASTORAL,"""Yes, I suppose I do, but that can't be helped; a promise is a promise."""
4210,A PASTORAL,
4211,A PASTORAL,"""Who is to prevent it?"" he exclaimed impatiently. ""I say it shall be"
4212,A PASTORAL,"helped."""
4213,A PASTORAL,
4214,A PASTORAL,There was not time for further rhapsodies. Aunt Hepsy appeared with a
4215,A PASTORAL,"telegram, calling Daisy home; and home she went next day, leaving Mr."
4216,A PASTORAL,John Smith in despair. In vain he laid siege to Aunt Hepzibah and
4217,A PASTORAL,Uncle Reuben; they could not help him.
4218,A PASTORAL,
4219,A PASTORAL,"Then, in a mighty wrath, he too went home, and desperately resolved to"
4220,A PASTORAL,"have it out with the Thornton girl, one way or the other; but not ""the"
4221,A PASTORAL,"other"" if Daisy could be brought to terms."
4222,A PASTORAL,
4223,A PASTORAL,It was easy travelling where the way was all prepared. So a lovely
4224,A PASTORAL,moonlight evening found him in Squire Thornton's parlor. In a few
4225,A PASTORAL,moments there floated down to him from the invisible upper regions a
4226,A PASTORAL,"cloud of blue muslin, and the laughing face of Daisy Merrifield was"
4227,A PASTORAL,before him.
4228,A PASTORAL,
4229,A PASTORAL,"""Oh, Daisy, what a surprise! and how sweet you are!"" as impulsively he"
4230,A PASTORAL,"strained her to his heart. ""What joy to find you here!"""
4231,A PASTORAL,
4232,A PASTORAL,"""Don't crush my dress,"" she said, righting up the ruffles; ""it's new."
4233,A PASTORAL,"Yes, I am here. Didn't you come to see me?"""
4234,A PASTORAL,
4235,A PASTORAL,"""No--that is--I came to see Miss Thornton,"" and his face fell."
4236,A PASTORAL,
4237,A PASTORAL,"""There is no Miss Thornton,"" she said, her dimples playing"
4238,A PASTORAL,"mischievously. ""It is only _I_--_now_ don't you know?"""
4239,A PASTORAL,
4240,A PASTORAL,"""But how is it? I was told--I understood--"""
4241,A PASTORAL,
4242,A PASTORAL,"""Pshaw! you stupid!"" she said, with a bewitching pout, ""if you had been"
4243,A PASTORAL,"a little more civil, you would have known that I am Mrs. Thornton's"
4244,A PASTORAL,"daughter--not Mr. Thornton's; that mamma is mamma, but papa isn't papa,"
4245,A PASTORAL,"and--"""
4246,A PASTORAL,
4247,A PASTORAL,But in an ecstacy of surprise and joy the rest of her sentence was
4248,A PASTORAL,entirely smothered.
4249,A PASTORAL,
4250,A PASTORAL,"""And you knew from the first?"" he asked, reproachfully."
4251,A PASTORAL,
4252,A PASTORAL,"""Not from the first, but almost. They were all in the plot. I meant to"
4253,A PASTORAL,"snub you outright, only--well, somehow you didn't look as horrid as you"
4254,A PASTORAL,"really were! The 'John Smith' was almost too much for me, but I stood"
4255,A PASTORAL,it. Then when the letter came--it was well for you I had seen you under
4256,A PASTORAL,"the tree. So you wouldn't marry the heiress,"" she said, archly. ""I did"
4257,A PASTORAL,"my very best to teach you a lesson, young man. Have you learned it?"""
4258,A PASTORAL,
4259,A PASTORAL,"The answer was fervently though silently given the merry, rosy, smiling"
4260,A PASTORAL,lips.
4261,A PASTORAL,
4262,A PASTORAL,
4263,A PASTORAL,
4264,A PASTORAL,
4265,A PASTORAL,Treesa
4266,A PASTORAL,
4267,A CHARACTER SKETCH,A CHARACTER SKETCH
4268,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4269,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4270,A CHARACTER SKETCH,They called her Treesa. She was not young. That she had ever been was
4271,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"hard to realize. Whatever her childhood, and however the years had"
4272,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"brought her up to woman's estate, there was no footprint upon the worn"
4273,A CHARACTER SKETCH,face of the gladsome time we call youth. No light in the eye of other
4274,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"and happier days. No echo in the quiet heart, of bounding pulses, or"
4275,A CHARACTER SKETCH,ever a sweet enthusiasm. The treadmill of duty in life's most trivial
4276,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"task, enthralled her every faculty. Her daily round was in a large"
4277,A CHARACTER SKETCH,hotel--an arena of toil circumscribed by four brick walls. Her domain
4278,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"was the parlor floor; that sacred area of rosy vistas and costly suites,"
4279,A CHARACTER SKETCH,where she was as proud to tread as a king in his royal glory. Where
4280,A CHARACTER SKETCH,beauty and fashion made for her a panorama of short glimpses amid pauses
4281,A CHARACTER SKETCH,of broom and duster.
4282,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4283,A CHARACTER SKETCH,The maids on the other floors might earn the wage just as honorably;
4284,A CHARACTER SKETCH,Treesa permitted no trespass upon her exalted territory. The bridal
4285,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"chambers, the private sitting rooms, the luxurious sleeping"
4286,A CHARACTER SKETCH,apartments--these were her pride and her joy. The Excelsior had a
4287,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"reputation, national and international. Princes and potentates had"
4288,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"slumbered in Treesa's chambers. The ""nobility and the gentry"" had been"
4289,A CHARACTER SKETCH,feted there. Year after year her pale eyes had watched over the welfare
4290,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"of distinguished visitors, American and foreign. They had seen the help"
4291,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"come and go; she was still the ""girl of the parlor floor."" Discreet,"
4292,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"silent, honest, they might well allow her a share of caprice. ""Cranky"""
4293,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"they called her, yet no one found fault. She neglected no duty. The lady"
4294,A CHARACTER SKETCH,manager of the interior was not always the same. She changed from time
4295,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"to time; Treesa was always the same, and always there. At length there"
4296,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"came a dainty little woman, full of native pluck, who was born to rule,"
4297,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"and rule she did, to the limit of her jurisdiction. Though so far apart,"
4298,A CHARACTER SKETCH,a kindred chord was struck between mistress and maid. The high spirit
4299,A CHARACTER SKETCH,that smouldered in these two never crossed; but with the smallest
4300,A CHARACTER SKETCH,tangible demonstration they were fast friends. The girl's horizon now
4301,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"bordered a triune interest;--the church, the mistress, and the parlor"
4302,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"floor. Gaunt and spare, she trod her beat. Shy of manner, with eyes"
4303,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"looking nowhere, she seemed a human machine of the broom. A woman"
4304,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"without kith or kin, without a history, and apparently without a memory."
4305,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"Never sick, never absent, never a letter from friends, never a visit"
4306,A CHARACTER SKETCH,away. The old habitues of the house liked her. She gave no sign of favor
4307,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"or disfavor, till at last it was their way to respect her and leave her"
4308,A CHARACTER SKETCH,alone. But whenever a mission of trust was needed Treesa was the one
4309,A CHARACTER SKETCH,called upon.
4310,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4311,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"But as the calmest stream is ruffled at some time on its course, so"
4312,A CHARACTER SKETCH,there comes to every human life a shock that upturns hidden forces. And
4313,A CHARACTER SKETCH,this came to Treesa. It was when she was one day summoned to the private
4314,A CHARACTER SKETCH,office downstairs: that dread tribunal for the wrongdoers of the large
4315,A CHARACTER SKETCH,household--a locality as little heeded by the girl as any other foreign
4316,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"place, albeit there had been new and strange proprietors as the years"
4317,A CHARACTER SKETCH,went by. Without so much as a ripple of excitement upon her homely
4318,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"features, she came down and stood within the door, respectfully awaiting"
4319,A CHARACTER SKETCH,orders. The two arbiters of her destiny were in close conference upon
4320,A CHARACTER SKETCH,ways and means. Expense must be cut down. There must be a weeding out.
4321,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"Raising his head and looking in some curiosity at the queer apparition,"
4322,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"the new partner said: ""Are you Teresa O'Toole?"""
4323,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4324,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"""Me name is that same, sir,"" she said, meeting the eyes. ""An' what thin,"
4325,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"sir?"" she added, as for a moment he was silent."
4326,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4327,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"""Yes--ah--"" he went on, this time not exactly confronting the expectant"
4328,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"face--""We've been thinking, Teresa--we were just saying--that you are"
4329,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"getting along in years now, and--ah--the fact is, we think you ought to"
4330,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"have a rest. Some one younger, and stronger, ought to relieve you, and"
4331,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"give you a chance to pick up. You are a good girl,"" with encouraging"
4332,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"justice, ""a very good girl, and have been faithful and honest. But we--"""
4333,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"he hesitated, as Treesa's lean face suddenly darkened with an unwonted"
4334,A CHARACTER SKETCH,flush. Then she broke out:
4335,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4336,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"""An' is it me dischairge ye'd be afther givin' me, sir?"""
4337,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4338,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"""Well, yes, about that, it amounts to that, I suppose,"" admitted the"
4339,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"great man. ""You see, my good woman,"" he ventured softly, noting the"
4340,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"breakers ahead, ""the fact is--"""
4341,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4342,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"""Well, thin,"" she burst forth in righteous wrath, placing her hard, red"
4343,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"arms akimbo, and struggling to loose her tongue, ""I'll be afther tellin'"
4344,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"yees, I'll not take a dischairge from yees, sir! It's here I've been"
4345,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"this fifty year, an' more. I was the first gurll in the house, for sure"
4346,A CHARACTER SKETCH,I come before the likes of yees was born an' before yees iver darkened
4347,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"the doors. It's no fault can be found with me. I'll stay right here!"""
4348,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"and turning, she went out."
4349,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4350,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"There was silence in the office. Then the senior partner, his eye"
4351,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"twinkling, spoke:"
4352,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4353,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"""What are we going to do about it?"""
4354,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4355,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"""Why, nothing"", drily said the other, ""nothing, I suppose; you heard"
4356,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"what she said, I presume she will stay on."""
4357,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4358,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"And stay on she did, her one dominant idea as fixed as the polar star."
4359,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"As the years rolled by she might have rested from her labors, but for"
4360,A CHARACTER SKETCH,this sense of devotion to duty. Even a monthly pittance will count
4361,A CHARACTER SKETCH,through the ages; so Treesa's savings came at last to foot up into the
4362,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"thousands. Not even good Father Clement could have told the amount, or"
4363,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"where she kept it. Like herself, it was a mystery. She continued to"
4364,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"hoard and to hide, with no misgiving of loss by thief, or by accident;"
4365,A CHARACTER SKETCH,with no forewarning of danger. Yet dire calamity was impending.
4366,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4367,A CHARACTER SKETCH,It was past midnight when the veteran chambermaid was awakened by the
4368,A CHARACTER SKETCH,sound of crackling wood and the smell of stifling smoke. To spring out
4369,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"of bed was the work of a moment, the aged limbs obedient to her call;"
4370,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"then all her faculties alert, she thrust her hand into a hidden recess"
4371,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"of the mattress, and clutching a bulky package from its depths, made her"
4372,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"way out into the corridor, where the smoke was still thicker, on down"
4373,A CHARACTER SKETCH,the stairs from the servants' dormitory to the floor below. Staggering
4374,A CHARACTER SKETCH,to the manager's door she pounded with all her strength till those
4375,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"within were aroused; and dizzy from fright and half-suffocation, she"
4376,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"ran to the fire alarm, banging the gong till doors flew open right and"
4377,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"left, and the halls were alive with people. The cry of ""Fire!"" on all"
4378,A CHARACTER SKETCH,sides now added to the din. More alarms were turned in till ample help
4379,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"was at hand. While the hotel manager's orders were being obeyed, and the"
4380,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"guests were deserting their rooms for greater safety in the lobby below,"
4381,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"Treesa was struggling to get back to the servant's floor, whence now"
4382,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"issued screams of terror, as, for the first time, the flames were seen"
4383,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"creeping in close proximity to the maid's quarters. In vain the firemen,"
4384,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"who were now cutting holes in the floor to insert the hose, tried to"
4385,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"intercept her. Bent upon serving her fellow-servants, she disappeared"
4386,A CHARACTER SKETCH,through the blinding smoke Crawling flat upon her face up the stairs
4387,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"to avoid the onset of the fumes, the girl reached the glass door that"
4388,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"imprisoned the terrified creatures, burst it through with one powerful"
4389,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"blow, and forced them out upon the fire escape, where now, too, the"
4390,A CHARACTER SKETCH,firemen's ladders were seen manned by the helmeted brigade. All bruised
4391,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"and bleeding from the splintered glass, and still clutching fast the"
4392,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"rescued package, Treesa turned to retrace her steps, her only thought"
4393,A CHARACTER SKETCH,now being to save the parlor floor and its treasures. Again she eluded
4394,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"those who would have guarded her from danger, and made a hurried dash"
4395,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"for the stairway, when a sudden rush of flame, now fanned by the air,"
4396,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"blinded her, and she fell to the landing, dropping the bulk of her"
4397,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"holdings, where the fire greedily licked it to destruction."
4398,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4399,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"Tender hands lifted her and conveyed her, crushed and unconscious, to"
4400,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"a temporary couch, where it was found, when the surgeon came, that her"
4401,A CHARACTER SKETCH,hip was dislocated. To the mistress alone would she unloose what her
4402,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"bleeding hand still held, as she whispered, ""Put it away, safe--Masses"
4403,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"for me soul--Father Clement."""
4404,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4405,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"But Treesa did not die. The morning papers rang with her heroism, but"
4406,A CHARACTER SKETCH,none then knew that she had lost the hoarded earnings of a life-time;
4407,A CHARACTER SKETCH,that the one package saved represented but a small proportion of her
4408,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"treasure. She was taken to a hospital, and, fortunately for her peace"
4409,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"of mind, the house was closed for repairs. During the weeks of building,"
4410,A CHARACTER SKETCH,the old bones were mending. The sufferer counted the days with jealous
4411,A CHARACTER SKETCH,watching. When an agony of fear seized upon her lest she might never go
4412,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"back, only the mistress or the kindly priest had power to quiet her, She"
4413,A CHARACTER SKETCH,was promised over and over again that she should not be supplanted.
4414,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4415,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"When the hotel opened anew, the daily press blazoned to the world the"
4416,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"fact, giving a personal paragraph to the officials, and including a"
4417,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"list of well-known names, among them the humble one of Teresa O'Toole,"
4418,A CHARACTER SKETCH,who had been a chambermaid there during sixty years. This scrap of paper
4419,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"was held fast in the horny fingers, and seemed to the fevered senses to"
4420,A CHARACTER SKETCH,keep alive the link between her and the only home she knew.
4421,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4422,A CHARACTER SKETCH,Hither she was borne at last to a small room that was to be her
4423,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"portion and her pension forevermore. Her old quarters, austere and clean"
4424,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"and bare, had been effaced by the carpenter's hammer, and this corner"
4425,A CHARACTER SKETCH,retreat had been partitioned from a domestic recess in the rear. But
4426,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"it was on the parlor floor, that fetich of a devoted life. Crippled"
4427,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"and useless, Treesa was an object of unobtrusive care. She kept her"
4428,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"shrunken savings about her person, more unwilling than ever to trust"
4429,A CHARACTER SKETCH,the unexplored fields of finance. She grew querulous. She must be
4430,A CHARACTER SKETCH,getting to her work again. Would the mistress be after letting her earn
4431,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"something--on the parlor floor, she tremulously added. Smiling sadly,"
4432,A CHARACTER SKETCH,permission was granted. Fondly the old creature took up her broom and
4433,A CHARACTER SKETCH,duster--bought anew for her--and limped painfully toward the beloved
4434,A CHARACTER SKETCH,rooms--the bridal chambers--the choicest suites where beauty and fashion
4435,A CHARACTER SKETCH,came. What a journey now! The grand parlors and long corridors were
4436,A CHARACTER SKETCH,interminable vistas of elegance and luxury. And--ah! what was that
4437,A CHARACTER SKETCH,clinging to the velvet carpet pile? A bit of paper carelessly let fall?
4438,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"And--yes, was there dust on the polished marble of yon table? Alas! that"
4439,A CHARACTER SKETCH,her dim eyes should live to behold the desecration. What shiftless
4440,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"wretch was doing the parlor floor, and she a useless block in her room!"
4441,A CHARACTER SKETCH,
4442,A CHARACTER SKETCH,The shock told. She staggered to a gorgeous sofa near the offending bit
4443,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"of rubbish, and sunk down in the act of reaching for it. This was the"
4444,A CHARACTER SKETCH,beginning of the end. Lying on her bed sleep deserted the fading eyes.
4445,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"An attendant was provided, who grew accustomed to mutterings she could"
4446,A CHARACTER SKETCH,not understand. She ceased to listen. In pity the mistress came often
4447,A CHARACTER SKETCH,and sat beside the couch. She listened and understood. She gathered the
4448,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"last wishes of the dying, and received as a sacred charge all that the"
4449,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"sufferer had to leave. Still the angel of death tarried, until sweet"
4450,A CHARACTER SKETCH,"peace shed a radiance over the departing soul, whose faith was steadfast"
4451,A CHARACTER SKETCH,to church and heaven.
4452,A CHARACTER SKETCH,

4465,THE DOG WITNESS,
4466,THE DOG WITNESS,
4467,THE DOG WITNESS,The court-house was crowded to its utmost capacity. Women as well as men
4468,THE DOG WITNESS,were there to hear the arguments in the case of the Commonwealth against
4469,THE DOG WITNESS,William Grant for the alleged murder of John Belt.
4470,THE DOG WITNESS,
4471,THE DOG WITNESS,Grant was a young man of handsome exterior and pleasing manners. He sat
4472,THE DOG WITNESS,"in the prisoner's box, and near him, closely veiled, was his beautiful"
4473,THE DOG WITNESS,"girlish wife, with her arm around a fine, manly boy, and her head bowed"
4474,THE DOG WITNESS,upon his sunny curls.
4475,THE DOG WITNESS,
4476,THE DOG WITNESS,"Near the group were the surviving relatives of the dead man, consisting"
4477,THE DOG WITNESS,"of the wife, mother and daughter. Their faces were heavy and stolid, and"
4478,THE DOG WITNESS,"their whole appearance indicated not only the lower walks of life, but"
4479,THE DOG WITNESS,the existence of evil passions and aggressive natures.
4480,THE DOG WITNESS,
4481,THE DOG WITNESS,"Belt had owned a small grocery some fifteen miles from town, in a wild"
4482,THE DOG WITNESS,glen at the mouth of a shallow stream that flowed into the Kentucky
4483,THE DOG WITNESS,river. The region was for a long time sparsely settled; but the
4484,THE DOG WITNESS,establishing of a government distillery and a railroad station had led
4485,THE DOG WITNESS,"to an increase of population, so that young Grant was induced to locate"
4486,THE DOG WITNESS,"there and open a shop for provisions and other supplies, that line of"
4487,THE DOG WITNESS,business having been the one chosen from his boyhood.
4488,THE DOG WITNESS,
4489,THE DOG WITNESS,"From the first Belt, who was one of the few German settlers in that part"
4490,THE DOG WITNESS,"of the country, resented what he was pleased to call an encroachment"
4491,THE DOG WITNESS,"upon his trade, and lost no opportunity of showing his ill-feeling. He"
4492,THE DOG WITNESS,"was a heavy-set, sullen man of about forty-five years of age, and showed"
4493,THE DOG WITNESS,"a dogged spirit even to his customers. In vain Grant strove, first to"
4494,THE DOG WITNESS,"pay no attention to his enmity, and afterward to conciliate him. He"
4495,THE DOG WITNESS,"continued obstinate, and his family were not behind him in giving"
4496,THE DOG WITNESS,insults and slights.
4497,THE DOG WITNESS,
4498,THE DOG WITNESS,"Time passed, and Grant prospered. He was obliging and agreeable, and"
4499,THE DOG WITNESS,"people naturally patronized his store, which he rendered as attractive"
4500,THE DOG WITNESS,"as his means and good taste would allow. His wife, too, charmed the"
4501,THE DOG WITNESS,"community by her simple, sweet ways; and motherly old ladies took"
4502,THE DOG WITNESS,special interest in her and her babe.
4503,THE DOG WITNESS,
4504,THE DOG WITNESS,"Grant built a neat cottage, and this gave fresh offense. At last Belt,"
4505,THE DOG WITNESS,"who was a drinking man as well as surly, swore that he would take"
4506,THE DOG WITNESS,Grant's life if the latter persisted in remaining there. His trade was
4507,THE DOG WITNESS,"falling off, and Grant was the cause. Matters reached a climax then,"
4508,THE DOG WITNESS,and Grant armed himself in case of a surprise.
4509,THE DOG WITNESS,
4510,THE DOG WITNESS,"One morning Belt was missing, and his family raised a hue and cry that"
4511,THE DOG WITNESS,"speedily brought a crowd about the house, just as Grant approached and"
4512,THE DOG WITNESS,made the startling announcement that he had shot at a man the night
4513,THE DOG WITNESS,"before, and was ready for such investigation as would be proper under"
4514,THE DOG WITNESS,"the circumstances. He stated that he had been aroused by a filing,"
4515,THE DOG WITNESS,"grating sound at his bedroom window, which was on the ground floor, and"
4516,THE DOG WITNESS,"that he sprang from his bed, threw open the front door, and fired upon"
4517,THE DOG WITNESS,a figure that retreated rapidly and was soon lost in the darkness.
4518,THE DOG WITNESS,
4519,THE DOG WITNESS,"Upon this Grant was held in custody, while a party of men went in search"
4520,THE DOG WITNESS,"of Belt. Hours were spent in vain, when it was suggested that Belt's"
4521,THE DOG WITNESS,"dog, a vicious mongrel-cur, should be put upon the trail. Accordingly"
4522,THE DOG WITNESS,"the dog, which was usually seen at Belt's heels, was given the scent of"
4523,THE DOG WITNESS,"his master's coat, and started rapidly down the road, his nose to the"
4524,THE DOG WITNESS,ground. The testimony as elicited at the trial showed that the brute had
4525,THE DOG WITNESS,"bounded along to the Grant cottage, leaped upon the window sill, sniffed"
4526,THE DOG WITNESS,"eagerly about the spot, then ran down the path to a clump of bushes on"
4527,THE DOG WITNESS,the river cliff. Here the creature stopped and set up a piteous howl.
4528,THE DOG WITNESS,"The pursuing party hastened to the spot, and there lay the body of Belt,"
4529,THE DOG WITNESS,"who had fallen and died, as the autopsy revealed, of internal hemorrhage"
4530,THE DOG WITNESS,"produced by a pistol shot. As if to corroborate Grant's statement, a"
4531,THE DOG WITNESS,chisel and a pistol were found in the grass under the window of his
4532,THE DOG WITNESS,bedroom.
4533,THE DOG WITNESS,
4534,THE DOG WITNESS,Such was the history of the case. The absence of any testimony in behalf
4535,THE DOG WITNESS,"of the prisoner beyond his own assertion, was painfully evident. His"
4536,THE DOG WITNESS,"wife supported him in the facts, but the law did not permit a wife to"
4537,THE DOG WITNESS,"testify in the husband's case, so this evidence was unavailable."
4538,THE DOG WITNESS,
4539,THE DOG WITNESS,"The natural sympathy which death awakens in the human breast,"
4540,THE DOG WITNESS,"especially a tragic one, had done its work even in the case of so"
4541,THE DOG WITNESS,"unpopular a man as Belt, and already he was considered a martyr."
4542,THE DOG WITNESS,The desperate lamentations and impoverished condition of his family
4543,THE DOG WITNESS,"asserted their claims, and the time of trial found public opinion"
4544,THE DOG WITNESS,greatly divided. The spark of envy in every community which had lain
4545,THE DOG WITNESS,"dormant as long as the Grants were novelties, sprung into life at their"
4546,THE DOG WITNESS,"unwonted prosperity, and the gaily painted store and fanciful cottage"
4547,THE DOG WITNESS,"became eyesores to more than one. Various rumors, like uncanny spirits"
4548,THE DOG WITNESS,"of air, floated about till the prisoner felt himself sinking into an"
4549,THE DOG WITNESS,"abyss. Once down, there seemed no power ready to lift him up."
4550,THE DOG WITNESS,
4551,THE DOG WITNESS,"He employed several distinguished attorneys as counsel, and I, a"
4552,THE DOG WITNESS,"struggling young lawyer, whose ambition was to be worthy the mantle of"
4553,THE DOG WITNESS,"an illustrious father, was also retained. There was something about the"
4554,THE DOG WITNESS,case that inspired me to the utmost of which I was capable. There was no
4555,THE DOG WITNESS,circumstantial evidence against the prisoner. He had frankly owned to
4556,THE DOG WITNESS,shooting the man. The issue rested upon his motive for the deed. What
4557,THE DOG WITNESS,"was the provocation? True, Belt may have threatened his life; but Belt"
4558,THE DOG WITNESS,"was a drunkard, and who attached any importance to his words?"
4559,THE DOG WITNESS,
4560,THE DOG WITNESS,"The prosecution endeavored to show that Grant, wearied with the enmity"
4561,THE DOG WITNESS,"of Belt, and wishing to be rid of him, had enticed him away on the night"
4562,THE DOG WITNESS,"of the killing, and shot him in cold blood. True, a chisel and pistol"
4563,THE DOG WITNESS,"had been found, but how easy for the prisoner to have placed them"
4564,THE DOG WITNESS,there to carry out his plans! The dead man was proved to be a harmless
4565,THE DOG WITNESS,"character, though of intemperate habits and rough ways. His antipathy to"
4566,THE DOG WITNESS,"Grant was only natural, since the latter had, by ingratiating manners,"
4567,THE DOG WITNESS,"flashy advertising dodges, and a few modern tricks of trade, ruined the"
4568,THE DOG WITNESS,"business of the old-fashioned, plain-sailing German."
4569,THE DOG WITNESS,
4570,THE DOG WITNESS,In the hands of such skillful manipulators the case grew blacker and
4571,THE DOG WITNESS,"blacker, and the face of my client reflected the anguish he saw his"
4572,THE DOG WITNESS,"wife enduring, and he powerless to comfort. He saw his beautiful,"
4573,THE DOG WITNESS,"idolized boy the son of a convict, and all that had made life worth the"
4574,THE DOG WITNESS,living shattered to the dust. Closer and closer the meshes were weaving
4575,THE DOG WITNESS,about him. The jurors sat with fixed gaze as one by one the speeches
4576,THE DOG WITNESS,were ended. At length the honorable counsel for the prosecution
4577,THE DOG WITNESS,"concluded a powerful argument, and I saw in the faces of the twelve"
4578,THE DOG WITNESS,men that it had told.
4579,THE DOG WITNESS,
4580,THE DOG WITNESS,"There was but one point left for me to make, and I wondered that my"
4581,THE DOG WITNESS,distinguished brethren had passed it by. They had dwelt upon the youth
4582,THE DOG WITNESS,"and good standing of the prisoner, and the uncalled-for persecution he"
4583,THE DOG WITNESS,had suffered. They pictured in graphic words the midnight attempt upon
4584,THE DOG WITNESS,"his life at his own house. A man's house is his castle, and he has the"
4585,THE DOG WITNESS,supreme right to defend both it and himself. They appealed to the
4586,THE DOG WITNESS,"sympathies of the jurors in behalf of the young, helpless wife and"
4587,THE DOG WITNESS,innocent child. Still there was wanting the one link in the chain of
4588,THE DOG WITNESS,positive evidence. Sympathy was well enough. The twelve sworn men
4589,THE DOG WITNESS,required proof. How was it to be shown them?
4590,THE DOG WITNESS,
4591,THE DOG WITNESS,"I was young, and I felt all the nervousness attendant upon a maiden"
4592,THE DOG WITNESS,"effort, but my heart was in the work and I launched forth. Nature had"
4593,THE DOG WITNESS,"given me a good voice, and I felt a certain power as I spoke. But"
4594,THE DOG WITNESS,I had not the egotism to suppose that I could compete with the learned
4595,THE DOG WITNESS,gentlemen who had preceded me unless I could make a decided hit in
4596,THE DOG WITNESS,summing up the testimony. This I did. When I came to the hitherto
4597,THE DOG WITNESS,"unnoticed dog, I dwelt there with a tenacity that was determined to"
4598,THE DOG WITNESS,convince. I portrayed the well-known fidelity of the dog. No matter what
4599,THE DOG WITNESS,"the master, whether fortune's pampered darling, or a beastly denizen of"
4600,THE DOG WITNESS,"the gutter, his dog was always his friend. Be he kind and gentle, or"
4601,THE DOG WITNESS,"cruel and pitiless, still his dog crouches in loving submission. And the"
4602,THE DOG WITNESS,"animal, whether a high-bred, glossy-coated favorite, with golden collar"
4603,THE DOG WITNESS,"and silken leash, for whom hundreds had been paid, or an ill-favored,"
4604,THE DOG WITNESS,ungainly brute picked up from nowhere and as thankful for a kick as for
4605,THE DOG WITNESS,"a crust, was loyal with a fidelity that puts to shame man's boasted"
4606,THE DOG WITNESS,friendship.
4607,THE DOG WITNESS,
4608,THE DOG WITNESS,"This man's dog had loved him. Drunk or sober, kind or cruel, his dog was"
4609,THE DOG WITNESS,not content out of his presence. Why was he not with the man on this
4610,THE DOG WITNESS,fatal night? Because Belt had chained him in order to follow out his
4611,THE DOG WITNESS,vengeance untraced. The master knew the sagacity of his dog. He wanted
4612,THE DOG WITNESS,"no companion on his midnight stroll. And when, restless and uneasy, the"
4613,THE DOG WITNESS,"dog was let loose and shown the garment of his master, what did he do?"
4614,THE DOG WITNESS,"He dashed away, nose to earth, in eager, loving pursuit, along the"
4615,THE DOG WITNESS,"road to Grant's cottage. There he sniffs the ground, where undoubtedly"
4616,THE DOG WITNESS,"the familiar scent lay, jumps upon the window-ledge with his fore paws,"
4617,THE DOG WITNESS,"whimpers, starts away, and follows the trail down the path to the"
4618,THE DOG WITNESS,beloved body now cold in death.
4619,THE DOG WITNESS,
4620,THE DOG WITNESS,What proof more convincing than that Belt had been there? How improbable
4621,THE DOG WITNESS,the trumped-up story that Grant could decoy from his home his bitterest
4622,THE DOG WITNESS,"enemy, especially at the midnight hour! A loaded pistol and a chisel"
4623,THE DOG WITNESS,were found under the window. It had been alleged that Grant placed them
4624,THE DOG WITNESS,"there for his own base purposes. But admitting that man could deceive,"
4625,THE DOG WITNESS,the dog would not. Canine instinct could not lie. Every man who knew the
4626,THE DOG WITNESS,nature of the animal must feel convinced that Belt's dog would never
4627,THE DOG WITNESS,have gone to that window except in honest pursuit of his master.
4628,THE DOG WITNESS,
4629,THE DOG WITNESS,"I felt that my speech had told, and as I sat down there was a stir in"
4630,THE DOG WITNESS,"the vast crowd. My client's face was flushed, and the wife's somber veil"
4631,THE DOG WITNESS,"was thrown back, revealing her large eyes lustrous with hope."
4632,THE DOG WITNESS,
4633,THE DOG WITNESS,"The Commonwealth's attorney occupied the floor for an hour, during which"
4634,THE DOG WITNESS,he ridiculed what he termed the schoolboy tales from his youthful
4635,THE DOG WITNESS,opponent. But when the jury retired I felt that my influence was still
4636,THE DOG WITNESS,"uppermost. The suspense was trying, but it did not last long. They"
4637,THE DOG WITNESS,"reported in a very short time, and the verdict, announced in a clear"
4638,THE DOG WITNESS,"ringing voice, was ""Not guilty!"""
4639,THE DOG WITNESS,
4640,THE DOG WITNESS,Grant sprang forward as his friends pressed near and seized my hand in
4641,THE DOG WITNESS,"a vise-like grip. Loud cheers rent the air, for again the fickle public"
4642,THE DOG WITNESS,"had veered around, the crowd surged to and fro, women wept, and the"
4643,THE DOG WITNESS,"fervent ""Thank God!"" that broke from the pallid lips of the young wife"
4644,THE DOG WITNESS,rang in my ears for many a day.
4645,THE DOG WITNESS,
4646,THE DOG WITNESS,"The foreman of the jury, a plain, intelligent farmer, drew me aside and"
4647,THE DOG WITNESS,"said, ""That dog done the business! There was no gittin' around that!"
4648,THE DOG WITNESS,"I've got a dog myself."""
4649,THE DOG WITNESS,
4650,THE DOG WITNESS,"Grant was forced to begin life anew, for his counsels' fees about"
4651,THE DOG WITNESS,"consumed his little savings, but he remained at his post honest and"
4652,THE DOG WITNESS,"industrious, and is one of the leading men in the now populous section."

4661,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4662,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,The day was warm and sunny. A few industrious and enterprising pioneers
4663,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"were seated on a log near the Wallace Cross Roads, in what is now"
4664,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"Garrard county, Ky. They were enjoying their noonday luncheon and"
4665,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,discussing the object of their woodland caucus. Suddenly the sound of an
4666,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,advancing horse arrested their attention. Pausing and looking toward a
4667,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"primitive opening in the deep-tangled wildwood, they soon saw both horse"
4668,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"and rider approaching, the latter looking about him as if a stranger to"
4669,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"the country. He was among them in another moment, receiving their rough"
4670,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"but hearty greetings, and manifesting genuine pleasure in his frank,"
4671,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"youthful countenance. Though not yet attained to full manhood, the"
4672,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"traveller's figure was tall and graceful, and his face, by no means"
4673,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"handsome, wore a genial glow that intensified the wonderful magnetism"
4674,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,of his manner.
4675,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4676,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""You seem to be a stranger in these parts,"" said one of the men, mopping"
4677,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,his forehead with his red bandana.
4678,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4679,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""Yes,"" answered the traveller. ""I am a few days out from home across the"
4680,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"mountains yonder. Can you direct me to Lexington?"""
4681,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4682,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""Easy, easy, sir,"" said the other, ""It's a good spell from this, but"
4683,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,there's a pretty fair road after you get out of these thickets. Sit
4684,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"down, sir; sit down and have a snack with us. You must be hungry, and"
4685,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"you won't find a tavern soon."""
4686,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4687,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"Nothing loth, the young stranger addressed himself to the cold corn"
4688,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"bread and bacon with a will, while the talk veered around to the"
4689,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,business of the day.
4690,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4691,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""You, see, sir, we are about to build a courthouse hereabouts, and have"
4692,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"our lawing to ourselves,"" said the first speaker. ""We've about decided"
4693,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"to plant the corner stone at the Cross Roads a little way from this."""
4694,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4695,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""It's a first rate location,"" said another. ""There's good water all"
4696,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"around and plenty of trees for lumber."""
4697,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4698,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""Nothing like making the right start,"" added a third voice."
4699,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4700,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"They continued to discuss plans for their future township, the stranger"
4701,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,entering with courteous interest into all their projects.
4702,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4703,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""I have often tried,"" said he, ""to look into the future of this grand"
4704,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,section of country. To the day when the spirit of internal improvement
4705,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,shall have levelled the roads and converted the hidden wealth of the
4706,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,soil into a glorious medium of happiness and prosperity. Then the mental
4707,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"stores of our hardy settlers will rapidly develop, and civilization will"
4708,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"prune down the rugged points of character, as the implements of the"
4709,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"husbandman break up the clods."""
4710,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4711,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,Rapt visions illumined the young speaker's features with a glow of
4712,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"national pride, and he saw not the looks of intelligent curiosity that"
4713,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,passed among his companions.
4714,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4715,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"Then starting up, he said, ""I must really be going. I have a long ride,"
4716,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,and the day is waning. I thank you heartily for your hospitality.
4717,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"I assure you it is as refreshing as it was unexpected."""
4718,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4719,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"They shook hands, and the stranger mounted his horse which was quietly"
4720,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"grazing near by. Catching up the bridle, he said: ""One of these days I"
4721,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"hope to visit your section again, and see the great results of which you"
4722,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"are now making the small beginning. Farewell."""
4723,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4724,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""One moment,"" said the man who had first greeted him; ""might I ask your"

4726,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4727,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""Not at all, sir, not at all. My name is Henry Clay."""
4728,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4729,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"For a few minutes after the departure of the young stranger, the small"
4730,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,knot of pioneers commented with admiring wonder upon his singularly

4737,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"Years after, the little town of Lancaster, which had grown from the"
4738,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"humble courthouse of the Cross Roads, was in a state of excitement such"
4739,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,as only villages are liable to experience. It was the occasion of a
4740,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"school examination, and the citizens were all more or less interested."
4741,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"At the appointed hour the house was full, and the classes were"
4742,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"marshalled in due order to the front. Four o'clock struck, and the"
4743,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"programme was drawing to a close, when one of the dignitaries of the"
4744,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"town entered the hall, accompanied by a tall, distinguished-looking"
4745,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"stranger, whose presence inspired the children with a certain sense of"
4746,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"awe. It was at once whispered about that the great statesman, Henry"
4747,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"Clay, was among them. Upon presenting him to the teacher, the school"
4748,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"rose, and chairs being provided, the exercises went on. When the time"
4749,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"came for making recitations, the young people exhibited marked signs"
4750,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,of embarrassment; but one by one they acquitted themselves creditably.
4751,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"At length a little blue-eyed, sunny-haired child ascended the platform"
4752,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"and recited ""The Old Oaken Bucket,"" with wonderful pathos, so accurate"
4753,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"was her enunciation, so impressive the varying cadences of her sweet"
4754,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,voice.
4755,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4756,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""Who is she?"" I inquired the great man when the storm of applause had"
4757,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,somewhat subsided.
4758,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4759,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""We call her 'Daisy of the Glen,'"" was the reply. ""She is a prodigy for"
4760,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,her age. Her history is a little singular. She was found not far from
4761,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"here in a wild glen, or ravine, when about three years old, and has"
4762,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,never been able to tell who or where her parents are. But I will relate
4763,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,the circumstances to you at another time. At present the trustees are

4765,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4766,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,Whereupon the grandest orator of his day arose and addressed a few
4767,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,remarks in simple language to his youthful audience. He told them of the
4768,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"day, when on the highway from Virginia into the Blue Grass region, he"
4769,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,rode into their woodland council on the rugged spot where their pretty
4770,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,little village now stood. And as their forefathers had cultivated the
4771,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"then dense wilderness, so he admonished them to study and improve their"
4772,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,minds in school. Great men and noted women had already sprung into fame
4773,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"from their young city, and many a glorious achievement of word, of pen,"
4774,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"and of sword, had given renown to the place whose birth he had"
4775,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,incidentally witnessed in the long ago.
4776,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4777,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,When he ceased speaking he had implanted the germ of honest ambition in
4778,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,the hearts of many of the little men and women whose future influence
4779,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"was to wield power for good or ill. That night, seated among friends"
4780,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"in the best room the little tavern afforded, Henry Clay learned further"
4781,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"particulars concerning wee, winsome Daisy of the Glen, whose appearance"
4782,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,and address had so charmed his fancy. She was evidently a stolen child.
4783,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"Her dress, when she was discovered by a hunter, was fine, and her whole"
4784,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,appearance indicative of an easy sphere of life. It was supposed that a
4785,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,band of gypsies had decoyed her away while carelessly straying too far

4802,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"a young girl of remarkably fair exterior, turned in an animated manner"

4836,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4837,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"Blushing beneath his admiring gaze, and thrilling with pleasure at his"
4838,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"words, Daisy proceeded to repeat all that she had ever remembered of her"
4839,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"home and parents. A large house, a doll as big as herself, and a tender"
4840,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"face bending above her, comprised her store of reminiscences. Since the"
4841,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"death of her foster mother she had remained with friends, and was soon"
4842,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"to be united in marriage to Roye Howard, a rising young lawyer, reared"
4843,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"in Lexington, and established at Lancaster only a few months."
4844,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4845,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"Talking confidingly of their promised happiness, the pair lingered among"
4846,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,the sylvan shades of the romantic spot till the waning sunlight bent
4847,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,their steps homeward.
4848,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4849,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,Next day was the regular County Court day in the village. The public
4850,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"square was crowded with vehicles, live stock, and countrymen whose chief"
4851,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"pleasure was to mix in motley crowds, and to whose fancy an uproar of"
4852,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"some kind was ever welcome. On such occasions, in the somewhat lax"
4853,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"administering of justice of those early times, the killing of a fellow"
4854,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,creature seemed indeed a trifle light as air.
4855,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4856,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,At a conspicuous corner of Danville street stood the house where
4857,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"Daisy Templeton had found a temporary home. A number of ladies, wives"
4858,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"of the Judge and various lawyers, had assembled here to dine, a custom"
4859,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,prevalent upon public occasions. The group were deeply engrossed in
4860,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"needle-work and cheerful conversation, when suddenly the crowds on the"
4861,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,square began surging and clamoring as though the turbulence of an angry
4862,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"sea had been turned loose upon a peaceful plain, Shouts rose higher and"
4863,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"higher, till at last a pistol shot resounded, and the ladies that had"
4864,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"crowded to the front windows plainly distinguished the cry, ""The Judge"
4865,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"is killed! Jim Burns has shot Judge Pierce!"" and the mob rushed toward"
4866,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"the mouth of Danville street in pursuit of the desperado, a noted"
4867,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,character of the county.
4868,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4869,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,Quickly passing out the back door of the parlor and closing it behind
4870,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"her, Daisy reached the side door, opening on Danville street and heavily"
4871,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"shaded with trees, and flung the door to just as a man, pale and"
4872,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"terrified, darted in, almost throwing her to the floor."
4873,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4874,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""Save me!"" was all he had breath to ejaculate."
4875,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4876,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""Up there!"" she hurriedly exclaimed, pointing up the stairway toward the"
4877,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,attic; then slamming the door against the mob who were pressing upon the
4878,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"steps, she turned the key in the lock and stood, awaiting she knew not"
4879,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"what. All this was the work of a moment, while the ladies in the parlor"
4880,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,were too intent upon watching the square for a glimpse of the Judge to
4881,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,know that so important a scene was being enacted just behind them. Mrs.
4882,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,Pierce had run down the front steps inquiring of every one if the report
4883,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,was true.
4884,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4885,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"Meanwhile, as Daisy stood silent and alone in the little passage, her"
4886,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"heart throbbing fast, the crowd outside beat upon the door and clamored"
4887,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"for Jim Burns. At this moment Stanley Livingstone, the young man of"
4888,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"the house, appeared from a bed-room in the rear where he had been"
4889,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"administering a dose of sleep to a severe headache, and asked with more"
4890,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,emphasis than grace.
4891,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4892,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""What the devil's broke loose?"""
4893,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4894,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,She dared not tell him the truth.
4895,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4896,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""Oh, Stanley,"" exclaimed she, much relieved, ""they are after Jim Burns."
4897,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,They think he is here and are determined to force their way in. They say
4898,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"he has killed Judge Pierce!"""
4899,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4900,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""Let me settle them,"" said Stanley, and throwing wide the door, he"
4901,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,assured them that Burns was not there--that he would certainly have seen
4902,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,the man if he had entered the house.
4903,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4904,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"Incredulous, but irresistibly impressed by his earnest words, they"
4905,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"retired to the opposite side of the street to watch for their prey, who,"
4906,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"they convinced themselves, had darted through the house and concealed"
4907,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,himself about the premises too quickly to be detected by the inmates.
4908,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"That the fugitive had disappeared at that side door, some of them knew"
4909,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,beyond question.
4910,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4911,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"As Stanley stepped out to learn exactly what the excitement meant, Daisy"
4912,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"again turned the key, and observing a stain of blood on her white dress,"
4913,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,she dared not re-enter the parlor with the tell-tale sign.
4914,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4915,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"Hurrying up the stairs, she filled a basin with water, and with a roll"
4916,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"of linen, proceeded quickly to the attic, where the man stood, leaning"
4917,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"against a packing-box, tightly clasping his hand."
4918,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4919,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""You are wounded somewhere?"" she asked."
4920,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4921,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""Yes, in the hand,"" he faintly answered. ""He shot me."""
4922,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4923,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""Who?"" asked the girl."
4924,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4925,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""The Judge,"" sullenly said Burns."
4926,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4927,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""Then you didn't kill him?"""
4928,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4929,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""Kill him! I wish I had!"""
4930,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4931,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"Going to a back window, Daisy signed to a servant to come up, but when"
4932,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"there, the frightened creature refused to touch the bloody hand. So"
4933,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"Daisy proceeded to bathe and dress the lacerated flesh, all the while"
4934,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"talking kindly and warningly to the man, who stared at the lovely vision"
4935,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,with something like shame in his face.
4936,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4937,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"As she started to leave him, a stone sped its way swiftly through the"
4938,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,window and fell at her feet.
4939,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4940,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""You see,"" said she, ""your life is not safe a moment where you are."
4941,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,They believe that you are here. Some one saw you enter the door.
4942,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,Remain perfectly quiet till nightfall and then go home a wiser and
4943,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"a better man."""
4944,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4945,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"""God bless you, miss!"" said the man brokenly. ""I have been very wicked"
4946,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"all my life. I have wronged many, and you more than all; but if my life"
4947,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"is spared, I'll make some things right."""
4948,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4949,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"Wondering at his words, Daisy left him and rejoined her friends, after"
4950,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,the brief absence which was destined to bear rich fruits to her orphaned
4951,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,heart.
4952,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4953,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"That night, under cover of the darkness, the man went away. But at ten"
4954,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"o'clock, in defiance of prudence, he came back, knocked boldly, and"
4955,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"asked to see Miss Templeton--he had a package for her. She came, and"
4956,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"placing something in her hand, abruptly left, mounted his horse, and"
4957,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"rode away in a fierce gallop, ere she could speak, and again Daisy"
4958,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,closed the door upon this thread of her romantic destiny.
4959,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,
4960,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"On opening the package she found a coral necklace and armlets, with"
4961,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"clasps engraved, and a soiled, miserably-scrawled letter. The initials"
4962,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"on the jewels were R.M. The letter told her that he, the desperate and"
4963,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"outlawed writer, had been leagued with a band of reckless men some years"
4964,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"ago, and had stolen her away from her beautiful home in Louisville,"
4965,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"thinking to obtain a heavy ransom. While passing through Garrard county,"
4966,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"he, the man to whose care the gang had confided her, because he was"
4967,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"sort o' womanish, they said, had lagged behind intent upon a bottle of"
4968,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"whisky, and when he recovered his senses, the child was gone. Fearing"
4969,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"that she had met her death, and knowing nothing then of the picnic party"
4970,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"that had rescued her, he fled the country for some years, and after his"
4971,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,return he had never had courage to confess his crime. Her parents were
4972,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"wealthy, and their name was Mentelle. He could tell her nothing of their"
4973,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,present whereabouts.

4982,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"grown grey with years and honors, is among them, never having lost sight"
4983,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"of his protege. After congratulating the pair and kissing the bride,"
4984,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,he bade her come with him to another apartment; and when she had
4985,A ROMANTIC SKETCH,"wonderingly obeyed, he proudly presented to her a handsome lady richly"

5779,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,For there is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed; and this
5780,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,"well-guarded secret, known to only four persons, was trembling at its"
5781,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,foundation. For her beloved father's sake the young wife was willing to
5782,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,endure privation; for she reasoned that Hammond would have no motive for
5783,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,vengeance if she were supposed to be lost; that her death would end the
5784,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,mysterious power that threatened disgrace to Colonel Dare. Stephen was

5792,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,his mind a suspicion somewhat akin to the truth. Rumors were afloat that
5793,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,"Stephen made nightly visits to the cave, not with exploring parties, but"
5794,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,alone. A young couple had been seen wandering over the hills in the
5795,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,moonlight. Superstition said it was the ghosts of the ill-fated lovers.
5796,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,But when Jason Hammond heard these things they startled him as if struck
5797,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,with an electric shock. He did not believe in ghosts. He resolved to

5799,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,the steep ledge that leads downward into the bowels of the earth. He
5800,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,drew his own conclusions.

5802,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,"If true, what should stay his vengeance against those who had thus"

5806,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,"fear of him kept Minnie Dare thus hidden, as in a grave. Aye, she feared"
5807,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,"disgrace for her father, and more than all, she feared his vengeance"
5808,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,against her husband--for he did not doubt that they were married.
5809,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,"Husband? As the word forced itself, the man ground his teeth in baffled"

5812,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,
5813,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,The path to the subterranean retreat was perilous to a stranger; but
5814,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,"having gone once, he was sure he could go again. The way was even now"
5815,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,"familiar enough as far as the black avenue of Dan. Here the string,"

5827,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,to steady the railing of the rickety bridge. The abrupt and narrow ledge
5828,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,"had hidden them from view. The escape was easy. All was clear now, and"
5829,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,the life of the man who had cheated him should pay the penalty. Should

5833,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,
5834,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,"Armed with a revolver, he groped on, using a torch as far as he dared."

5837,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,"puzzling to the uninitiated. As he approached the cosy bower he heard,"
5838,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,"to his chagrin, the voice of the guide. What should he do? The odds were"
5839,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,too many for him. Wait till next day when his victims would probably be
5840,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,alone? Risk going in upon them before nightfall? How had Stephen eluded
5841,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,his vigilance? In this dilemma he crept near enough to get a view of the
5842,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,"interior. The sight of Minnie Brand seated at her husband's knee, his"
5843,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,"hand caressing her flowing curls, so inflamed his wrath that an oath"
5844,WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY,burst from his lips. The sound penetrated the boudoir. It was this time

5964,A REVERIE,The night comes on apace;
5965,A REVERIE,"The cricket's chirp, the woodland murmur's swell,"
5966,A REVERIE,Bid nature's changeling melodies efface
5967,A REVERIE,The glamour of yon phantom spell.
5968,A REVERIE,"The flashing morn adown the glist'ning aisles,"
5969,A REVERIE,"A dew-embowered hill and grove and lea,"
5970,A REVERIE,"With ruthless light will scatter fairy wiles,"
5971,A REVERIE,Nor leave my love to me.

5982,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"'Twas cold and bleak that winter's night,"
5983,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"When hover'd o'er the dying light,"
5984,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"The miser hugg'd his shrunken form,"
5985,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,And grudged the fire that made him warm.
5986,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,
5987,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"The old worn latch arose and felt,"
5988,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,He started up with threat'ning yell--
5989,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"'Begone!""--as in the open door"
5990,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"A woman stood, faint and foot-sore."
5991,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,
5992,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"""Just this,"" she begged, ""this rotten board--"
5993,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"'Twill not be missed from out your hoard."""
5994,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"""Take it and go!"" he thundered out--"
5995,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"""Oh, thanks,"" she moaned, and turned about."
5996,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,
5997,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,Another shivering night he sat;
5998,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"A lad came in--""Please, Mister,""--""What?"""
5999,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"""This piece of rope."" He said not nay,"
6000,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,But curs'd him as he went his way.
6001,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,
6002,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,And once again there ventured nigh
6003,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"A child, who fled with frightened cry,"
6004,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,As at her head a rusty key--
6005,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,The gift she craved--he flung with glee.

6008,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,
6009,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,The sands of life were nearly run;
6010,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"""What good to others have you done?"""
6011,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,The angel ask'd. The miser sighed.
6012,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"""Not one kind act,"" he sadly cried."
6013,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,
6014,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"""Not one? Did you ne'er give, nor lend"
6015,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"Relief to neighbor, suppliant, friend?"""
6016,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,The dying eyes were closed--he thought
6017,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,On all the misery he had wrought.
6018,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,
6019,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"A ray of light! ""I gave a board."""
6020,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"""'Tis well--'twill span death's river ford."""
6021,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"""A mouldy rope."" ""'Twill reach from earth"
6022,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"To Heaven. What more of feeble worth?"""
6023,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"""A rusty key."" ""Unlocks the gate."
6024,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,Is this the sum? No--not too late;
6025,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"The sinner's Friend has room for all,--"
6026,THE MISER AND THE ANGEL,"The least you do is not too small."""

6041,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,A soul is gather'd home;
6042,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,"At morn, at eve, on mission kind intent,"
6043,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,"Her footsteps evermore were wont to roam,"
6044,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,Till years their ceaseless labor spent.
6045,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,Each day its olive leaf of grace brought in--
6046,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,garner'd leaf from charity's broad field;
6047,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,"Each day's good deeds redeem'd a life from sin,"
6048,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,And gray'd anew her shield.
6049,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,
6050,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,"The lowly suppliant bless'd,"
6051,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,When to the hovel came her welcome smile;
6052,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,"The cold, the hungry, friendless and distress'd,"
6053,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,With gen'rous aid she cheer'd the while;
6054,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,And not alone the desolate and poor
6055,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,Sought counsel of her wisdom and her love;
6056,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,The high-born and the cultured cross'd her door
6057,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,To share her treasure-trove.
6058,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,
6059,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,"A nature great and high,"
6060,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,No puny thought could dwell within her breast;
6061,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,How sad to see her worth untimely die!
6062,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,Yet who may wail the needful rest?
6063,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,"Her willing hand, her tireless step, her active brain,"
6064,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,Rear'd lofty landmarks on the busy way;
6065,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,"The haunts that knew her long'd with yearning vain,"
6066,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,The reaper's scythe to stay.
6067,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,
6068,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,The strife at last is o'er;
6069,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,The strife that all great souls must needs endure;
6070,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,"And anchor'd fast on Eden's peaceful shore,"
6071,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,Her roving bark is strong and sure.
6072,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,The world is full of workers for the right;
6073,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,"""They also serve who only stand and wait."""
6074,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,No waiting servant she; with armor bright
6075,IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER,She pass'd the pearly gate.
