32,DIRAE,I saw the double-featured statue stand
33,DIRAE,"Of Memnon or of Janus, half with night"

37,DIRAE,And all the old westward face of time grown grey

58,JOSEPH MAZZINI,
59,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Upon a windy night of stars that fell
60,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"At the wind's spoken spell,"
61,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Swept with sharp strokes of agonizing light
62,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"From the clear gulf of night,"
63,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Between the fixed and fallen glories one
64,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Against my vision shone,"
65,JOSEPH MAZZINI,More fair and fearful and divine than they
66,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"That measure night and day,"
67,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And worthier worship; and within mine eyes
68,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The formless folded skies
69,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Took shape and were unfolded like as flowers.
70,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And I beheld the hours
71,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"As maidens, and the days as labouring men,"
72,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And the soft nights again
73,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"As wearied women to their own souls wed,"
74,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And ages as the dead.
75,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And over these living, and them that died,"
76,JOSEPH MAZZINI,From one to the other side
77,JOSEPH MAZZINI,A lordlier light than comes of earth or air
78,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Made the world's future fair.
79,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"A woman like to love in face, but not"
80,JOSEPH MAZZINI,A thing of transient lot--
81,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And like to hope, but having hold on truth--"
82,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And like to joy or youth,"
83,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Save that upon the rock her feet were set--
84,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And like what men forget,"
85,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Faith, innocence, high thought, laborious peace--"
86,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And yet like none of these,"
87,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Being not as these are mortal, but with eyes"
88,JOSEPH MAZZINI,That sounded the deep skies
89,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And clove like wings or arrows their clear way
90,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Through night and dawn and day--
91,JOSEPH MAZZINI,So fair a presence over star and sun
92,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Stood, making these as one."
93,JOSEPH MAZZINI,For in the shadow of her shape were all
94,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Darkened and held in thrall,"
95,JOSEPH MAZZINI,So mightier rose she past them; and I felt
96,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Whose form, whose likeness knelt"
97,JOSEPH MAZZINI,With covered hair and face and clasped her knees;
98,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And knew the first of these
99,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Was Freedom, and the second Italy."
100,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And what sad words said she
101,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"For mine own grief I knew not, nor had heart"
102,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Therewith to bear my part
103,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And set my songs to sorrow; nor to hear
104,JOSEPH MAZZINI,How tear by sacred tear
105,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Fell from her eyes as flowers or notes that fall
106,JOSEPH MAZZINI,In some slain feaster's hall
107,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Where in mid music and melodious breath
108,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Men singing have seen death.
109,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"So fair, so lost, so sweet she knelt; or so"
110,JOSEPH MAZZINI,In our lost eyes below
111,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Seemed to us sorrowing; and her speech being said,"
112,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Fell, as one who falls dead."
113,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And for a little she too wept, who stood"
114,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Above the dust and blood
115,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And thrones and troubles of the world; then spake,"
116,JOSEPH MAZZINI,As who bids dead men wake.
117,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"""Because the years were heavy on thy head;"
118,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Because dead things are dead;
119,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Because thy chosen on hill-side, city and plain"
120,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Are shed as drops of rain;
121,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Because all earth was black, all heaven was blind,"
122,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And we cast out of mind;
123,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Because men wept, saying _Freedom_, knowing of thee,"
124,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Child, that thou wast not free;"
125,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Because wherever blood was not shame was
126,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Where thy pure foot did pass;
127,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Because on Promethean rocks distent
128,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Thee fouler eagles rent;
129,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Because a serpent stains with slime and foam
130,JOSEPH MAZZINI,This that is not thy Rome;
131,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Child of my womb, whose limbs were made in me,"
132,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Have I forgotten thee?
133,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"In all thy dreams through all these years on wing,"
134,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Hast thou dreamed such a thing?
135,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"The mortal mother-bird outsoars her nest,"
136,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The child outgrows the breast;
137,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"But suns as stars shall fall from heaven and cease,"
138,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Ere we twain be as these;
139,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Yea, utmost skies forget their utmost sun,"
140,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Ere we twain be not one.
141,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"My lesser jewels sewn on skirt and hem,"
142,JOSEPH MAZZINI,I have no heed of them
143,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Obscured and flawed by sloth or craft or power;
144,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"But thou, that wast my flower,"
145,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The blossom bound between my brows and worn
146,JOSEPH MAZZINI,In sight of even and morn
147,JOSEPH MAZZINI,From the last ember of the flameless west
148,JOSEPH MAZZINI,To the dawn's baring breast--
149,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"I were not Freedom if thou wert not free,"
150,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Nor thou wert Italy.
151,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O mystic rose ingrained with blood, impearled"
152,JOSEPH MAZZINI,With tears of all the world!
153,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The torpor of their blind brute-ridden trance
154,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Kills England and chills France;
155,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And Spain sobs hard through strangling blood; and snows
156,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Hide the huge eastern woes.
157,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"But thou, twin-born with morning, nursed of noon,"
158,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And blessed of star and moon!
159,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"What shall avail to assail thee any more,"
160,JOSEPH MAZZINI,From sacred shore to shore?
161,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Have Time and Love not knelt down at thy feet,"
162,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Thy sore, thy soiled, thy sweet,"
163,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Fresh from the flints and mire of murderous ways
164,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And dust of travelling days?
165,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Hath Time not kissed them, Love not washed them fair,"
166,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And wiped with tears and hair?
167,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Though God forget thee, I will not forget;"
168,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Though heaven and earth be set
169,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Against thee, O unconquerable child,"
170,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Abused, abased, reviled,"
171,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Lift thou not less from no funereal bed
172,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Thine undishonoured head;
173,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Love thou not less, by lips of thine once prest,"
174,JOSEPH MAZZINI,This my now barren breast;
175,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Seek thou not less, being well assured thereof,"
176,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O child, my latest love."
177,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"For now the barren bosom shall bear fruit,"
178,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Songs leap from lips long mute,"
179,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And with my milk the mouths of nations fed
180,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Again be glad and red
181,JOSEPH MAZZINI,That were worn white with hunger and sorrow and thirst;
182,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And thou, most fair and first,"
183,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Thou whose warm hands and sweet live lips I feel
184,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Upon me for a seal,"
185,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Thou  whose  least looks, whose smiles and little sighs,"
186,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Whose passionate pure eyes,"
187,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Whose dear fair limbs that neither bonds could bruise
188,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Nor hate of men misuse,"
189,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Whose flower-like breath and bosom, O my child,"
190,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O mine and undefiled,"
191,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Fill with such tears as burn like bitter wine
192,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"These mother's eyes of mine,"
193,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Thrill with huge passions and primeval pains
194,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"The fullness of my veins,"
195,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O sweetest head seen higher than any stands,"
196,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"I touch thee with mine hands,"
197,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"I lay my lips upon thee, O thou most sweet,"
198,JOSEPH MAZZINI,To lift thee on thy feet
199,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And with the fire of mine to fill thine eyes;
200,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"I say unto thee, Arise."""
201,JOSEPH MAZZINI,
202,JOSEPH MAZZINI,§
203,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"She ceased, and heaven was full of flame and sound,"
204,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And earth's old limbs unbound
205,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Shone and waxed warm with fiery dew and seed
206,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Shed through her at this her need:
207,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And highest in heaven, a mother and full of grace,"
208,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"With no more covered face,"
209,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"With no more lifted hands and bended knees,"
210,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Rose, as from sacred seas"
211,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Love, when old time was full of plenteous springs,"
212,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"That fairest-born of things,"
213,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The land that holds the rest in tender thrall
214,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"For love's sake in them all,"
215,JOSEPH MAZZINI,That binds with words and holds with eyes and hands
216,JOSEPH MAZZINI,All hearts in all men's lands.
217,JOSEPH MAZZINI,So died the dream whence rose the live desire
218,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"That here takes form and fire,"
219,JOSEPH MAZZINI,A spirit from the splendid grave of sleep
220,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Risen, that ye should not weep,"
221,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Should not weep more nor ever, O ye that hear"
222,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And ever have held her dear,"
223,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Seeing now indeed she weeps not who wept sore,"
224,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And sleeps not any more.
225,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Hearken ye towards her, O people, exalt your eyes;"
226,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Is this a thing that dies?
227,JOSEPH MAZZINI,
228,JOSEPH MAZZINI,§
229,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Italia! by the passion of the pain
230,JOSEPH MAZZINI,That bent and rent thy chain;
231,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Italia! by the breaking of the bands,"
232,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The shaking of the lands;
233,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Beloved, O men's mother, O men's queen,"
234,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Arise, appear, be seen!"
235,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Arise, array thyself in manifold"
236,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Queen's raiment of wrought gold;
237,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"With girdles of green freedom, and with red"
238,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Roses, and white snow shed"
239,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Above the flush and frondage of the hills
240,JOSEPH MAZZINI,That all thy deep dawn fills
241,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And all thy clear night veils and warms with wings
242,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Spread till the morning sings;
243,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"The rose of resurrection, and the bright"
244,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Breast lavish of the light,"
245,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The lady lily like the snowy sky
246,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Ere the stars wholly die;
247,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"As red as blood, and whiter than a wave,"
248,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Flowers grown as from thy grave,"
249,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"From the green fruitful grass in Maytime hot,"
250,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Thy grave, where thou art not."
251,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Gather the grass and weave, in sacred sign"
252,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Of the ancient earth divine,"
253,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"The holy heart of things, the seed of birth,"
254,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The mystical warm earth.
255,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O thou her flower of flowers, with treble braid"
256,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Be thy sweet head arrayed,"
257,JOSEPH MAZZINI,In witness of her mighty motherhood
258,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Who bore thee and found thee good,"
259,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Her fairest-born of children, on whose head"
260,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Her green and white and red
261,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Are hope and light and life, inviolate"
262,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Of any latter fate.
263,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Fly, O our flag, through deep Italian air,"
264,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Above the flags that were,"
265,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The dusty shreds of shameful battle-flags
266,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Trampled and rent in rags,"
267,JOSEPH MAZZINI,As withering woods in autumn's bitterest breath
268,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Yellow, and black as death;"
269,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Black as crushed worms that sicken in the sense,"
270,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And yellow as pestilence.
271,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Fly, green as summer and red as dawn and white"
272,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"As the live heart of light,"
273,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"The blind bright womb of colour unborn, that brings"
274,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Forth all fair forms of things,"
275,JOSEPH MAZZINI,As freedom all fair forms of nations dyed
276,JOSEPH MAZZINI,In divers-coloured pride.
277,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Fly fleet as wind on every wind that blows
278,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Between her seas and snows,"
279,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"From Alpine white, from Tuscan green, and where"
280,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Vesuvius reddens air.
281,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Fly! and let all men see it, and all kings wail,"
282,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And priests wax faint and pale,"
283,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And the cold hordes that moan in misty places
284,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And the funereal races
285,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And the sick serfs of lands that wait and wane
286,JOSEPH MAZZINI,See thee and hate thee in vain.
287,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"In the clear laughter of all winds and waves,"
288,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"In the blown grass of graves,"
289,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"In the long sound of fluctuant boughs of trees,"
290,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"In the broad breath of seas,"
291,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Bid the sound of thy flying folds be heard;
292,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And as a spoken word
293,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Full of that fair god and that merciless
294,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Who rends the Pythoness,"
295,JOSEPH MAZZINI,So be the sound and so the fire that saith
296,JOSEPH MAZZINI,She feels her ancient breath
297,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And the old blood move in her immortal veins.
298,JOSEPH MAZZINI,
299,JOSEPH MAZZINI,§
300,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Strange travail and strong pains,"
301,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Our mother, hast thou borne these many years"
302,JOSEPH MAZZINI,While thy pure blood and tears
303,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Mixed with the Tyrrhene and the Adrian sea;
304,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Light things were said of thee,"
305,JOSEPH MAZZINI,As of one buried deep among the dead;
306,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Yea, she hath been, they said,"
307,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"She was when time was younger, and is not;"
308,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The very cerecloths rot
309,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"That flutter in the dusty wind of death,"
310,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Not moving with her breath;
311,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Far seasons and forgotten years enfold
312,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Her dead corpse old and cold
313,JOSEPH MAZZINI,With many windy winters and pale springs:
314,JOSEPH MAZZINI,She is none of this world's things.
315,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Though her dead head like a live garland wear
316,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The golden-growing hair
317,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"That flows over her breast down to her feet,"
318,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Dead queens, whose life was sweet"
319,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"In sight of all men living, have been found"
320,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"So cold, so clad, so crowned,"
321,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"With all things faded and with one thing fair,"
322,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Their old immortal hair,"
323,JOSEPH MAZZINI,When flesh and bone turned dust at touch of day:
324,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And she is dead as they.
325,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"So men said sadly, mocking; so the slave,"
326,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Whose life was his soul's grave;
327,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"So, pale or red with change of fast and feast,"
328,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The sanguine-sandalled priest;
329,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"So the Austrian, when his fortune came to flood,"
330,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And the warm wave was blood;
331,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"With wings that widened and with beak that smote,"
332,JOSEPH MAZZINI,So shrieked through either throat
333,JOSEPH MAZZINI,From the hot horror of its northern nest
334,JOSEPH MAZZINI,That double-headed pest;
335,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"So, triple-crowned with fear and fraud and shame,"
336,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"He of whom treason came,"
337,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The herdsman of the Gadarean swine;
338,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"So all his ravening kine,"
339,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Made fat with poisonous pasture; so not we,"
340,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Mother, beholding thee."
341,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Make answer, O the crown of all our slain,"
342,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Ye that were one, being twain,"
343,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Twain brethren, twin-born to the second birth,"
344,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Chosen out of all our earth
345,JOSEPH MAZZINI,To be the prophesying stars that say
346,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"How hard is night on day,"
347,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Stars in serene and sudden heaven rerisen
348,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Before the sun break prison
349,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And ere the moon be wasted; fair first flowers
350,JOSEPH MAZZINI,In that red wreath of ours
351,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Woven with the lives of all whose lives were shed
352,JOSEPH MAZZINI,To crown their mother's head
353,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"With leaves of civic cypress and thick yew,"
354,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Till the olive bind it too,"
355,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Olive and laurel and all loftier leaves
356,JOSEPH MAZZINI,That victory wears or weaves
357,JOSEPH MAZZINI,At her fair feet for her beloved brow;
358,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Hear, for she too hears now,"
359,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O Pisacane, from Calabrian sands;"
360,JOSEPH MAZZINI,O all heroic hands
361,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Close on the sword-hilt, hands of all her dead;"
362,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O many a holy head,"
363,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Bowed for her sake even to her reddening dust;
364,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O chosen, O pure and just,"
365,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Who counted for a small thing life's estate,"
366,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And died, and made it great;"
367,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Ye whose names mix with all her memories; ye
368,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Who rather chose to see
369,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Death, than our more intolerable things;"
370,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Thou whose name withers kings,"
371,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Agesilao; thou too, O chiefliest thou,"
372,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"The slayer of splendid brow,"
373,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Laid where the lying lips of fear deride
374,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"The foiled tyrannicide,"
375,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Foiled, fallen, slain, scorned, and happy; being in fame,"
376,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Felice, like thy name,"
377,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Not like thy fortune; father of the fight,"
378,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Having in hand our light.
379,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Ah, happy! for that sudden-swerving hand"
380,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Flung light on all thy land,"
381,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Yea, lit blind France with compulsory ray,"
382,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Driven down a righteous way;
383,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Ah, happiest! for from thee the wars began,"
384,JOSEPH MAZZINI,From thee the fresh springs ran;
385,JOSEPH MAZZINI,From thee the lady land that queens the earth
386,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Gat as she gave new birth.
387,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O sweet mute mouths, O all fair dead of ours,"
388,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Fair in her eyes as flowers,"
389,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Fair without feature, vocal without voice,"
390,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Strong without strength, rejoice!"
391,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Hear it with ears that hear not, and on eyes"
392,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"That see not let it rise,"
393,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Rise as a sundawn; be it as dew that drips
394,JOSEPH MAZZINI,On dumb and dusty lips;
395,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Eyes have ye not, and see it; neither ears,"
396,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And there is none but hears.
397,JOSEPH MAZZINI,This is the same for whom ye bled and wept;
398,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"She was not dead, but slept."
399,JOSEPH MAZZINI,This is that very Italy which was
400,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And is and shall not pass.
401,JOSEPH MAZZINI,
402,JOSEPH MAZZINI,§
403,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"But thou, though all were not well done, O chief,"
404,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Must thou take shame or grief?
405,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Because one man is not as thou or ten,"
406,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Must thou take shame for men?
407,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Because the supreme sunrise is not yet,"
408,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Is the young dew not wet?
409,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Wilt thou not yet abide a little while,"
410,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Soul without fear or guile,"
411,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Mazzini,--O our prophet, O our priest,"
412,JOSEPH MAZZINI,A little while at least?
413,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"A little hour of doubt and of control,"
414,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Sustain thy sacred soul;
415,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Withhold thine heart, our father, but an hour;"
416,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Is it not here, the flower,"
417,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Is it not blown and fragrant from the root,"
418,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And shall not be the fruit?
419,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Thy children, even thy people thou hast made,"
420,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Thine, with thy words arrayed,"
421,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Clothed with thy thoughts and girt with thy desires,"
422,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Yearn up toward thee as fires.
423,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Art thou not father, O father, of all these?"
424,JOSEPH MAZZINI,From thine own Genoese
425,JOSEPH MAZZINI,To where of nights the lower extreme lagune
426,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Feels its Venetian moon,"
427,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Nor suckling's mouth nor mother's breast set free
428,JOSEPH MAZZINI,But hath that grace through thee.
429,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The milk of life on death's unnatural brink
430,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Thou gavest them to drink,"
431,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The natural milk of freedom; and again
432,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"They drank, and they were men."
433,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The wine and honey of freedom and of faith
434,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"They drank, and cast off death."
435,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Bear with them now; thou art holier: yet endure,"
436,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Till they as thou be pure.
437,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Their swords at least that stemmed half Austria's tide
438,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Bade all its bulk divide;
439,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Else, though fate bade them for a breath's space fall,"
440,JOSEPH MAZZINI,She had not fallen at all.
441,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Not by their hands they made time's promise true;
442,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Not by their hands, but through."
443,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Nor on Custoza ran their blood to waste,"
444,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Nor fell their fame defaced
445,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Whom stormiest Adria with tumultuous tides
446,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Whirls undersea and hides.
447,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Not his, who from the sudden-settling deck"
448,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Looked over death and wreck
449,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"To where the mother's bosom shone, who smiled"
450,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"As he, so dying, her child;"
451,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"For he smiled surely, dying, to mix his death"
452,JOSEPH MAZZINI,With her memorial breath;
453,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Smiled, being most sure of her, that in no wise,"
454,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Die whoso will, she dies:"
455,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And she smiled surely, fair and far above,"
456,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Wept not, but smiled for love."
457,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Thou too, O splendour of the sudden sword"
458,JOSEPH MAZZINI,That drove the crews abhorred
459,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"From Naples and the siren-footed strand,"
460,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Flash from thy master's hand,"
461,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Shine from the middle summer of the seas
462,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"To the old Aeolides,"
463,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Outshine their fiery fumes of burning night,"
464,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Sword, with thy midday light;"
465,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Flame as a beacon from the Tyrrhene foam
466,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"To the rent heart of Rome,"
467,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"From the island of her lover and thy lord,"
468,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Her saviour and her sword.
469,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"In the fierce year of failure and of fame,"
470,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Art thou not yet the same
471,JOSEPH MAZZINI,That wast as lightning swifter than all wings
472,JOSEPH MAZZINI,In the blind face of kings?
473,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"When priests took counsel to devise despair,"
474,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And princes to forswear,"
475,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"She clasped thee, O her sword and flag-bearer"
476,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And staff and shield to her,"
477,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O Garibaldi; need was hers and grief,"
478,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Of thee and of the chief,"
479,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And of another girt in arms to stand
480,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"As good of hope and hand,"
481,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"As high of soul and happy, albeit indeed"
482,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"The heart should burn and bleed,"
483,JOSEPH MAZZINI,So but the spirit shake not nor the breast
484,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Swerve, but abide its rest."
485,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"As theirs did and as thine, though ruin clomb"
486,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"The highest wall of Rome,"
487,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Though treason stained and spilt her lustral water,"
488,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And slaves led slaves to slaughter,"
489,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And priests, praying and slaying, watched them pass"
490,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"From a strange France, alas,"
491,JOSEPH MAZZINI,That was not freedom; yet when these were past
492,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Thy sword and thou stood fast,"
493,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Till new men seeing thee where Sicilian waves
494,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Hear now no sound of slaves,"
495,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And where thy sacred blood is fragrant still
496,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Upon the Bitter Hill,"
497,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Seeing by that blood one country saved and stained,"
498,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Less loved thee crowned than chained,"
499,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And less now only than the chief: for he,"
500,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Father of Italy,"
501,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Upbore in holy hands the babe new-born
502,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Through loss and sorrow and scorn,"
503,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Of no man led, of many men reviled;"
504,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Till lo, the new-born child"
505,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Gone from between his hands, and in its place,"
506,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Lo, the fair mother's face."
507,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Blessed is he of all men, being in one"
508,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"As father to her and son,"
509,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Blessed of all men living, that he found"
510,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Her weak limbs bared and bound,"
511,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And in his arms and in his bosom bore,"
512,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And as a garment wore
513,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Her weight of want, and as a royal dress"
514,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Put on her weariness.
515,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"As in faith's hoariest histories men read,"
516,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The strong man bore at need
517,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Through roaring rapids when all heaven was wild
518,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The likeness of a child
519,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"That still waxed greater and heavier as he trod,"
520,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And altered, and was God."
521,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him, O winds that move the molten air,"
522,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O light of days that were,"
523,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And light of days that shall be; land and sea,"
524,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And heaven and Italy:
525,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him, O storm and summer, shore and wave,"
526,JOSEPH MAZZINI,O skies and every grave;
527,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O weeping hopes, O memories beyond tears,"
528,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O many and murmuring years,"
529,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O sounds far off in time and visions far,"
530,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O sorrow with thy star,"
531,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And joy with all thy beacons; ye that mourn,"
532,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And ye whose light is born;
533,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O fallen faces, and O souls arisen,"
534,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him from tomb and prison,"
535,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him from heaven and sunlight; and ye floods,"
536,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And windy waves of woods;
537,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Ye valleys and wild vineyards, ye lit lakes"
538,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And happier hillside brakes,"
539,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Untrampled by the accursed feet that trod
540,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Fields golden from their god,"
541,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Fields of their god forsaken, whereof none"
542,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Sees his face in the sun,"
543,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Hears his voice from the floweriest wildernesses;
544,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And, barren of his tresses,"
545,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Ye bays unplucked and laurels unentwined,"
546,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"That no men break or bind,"
547,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And myrtles long forgetful of the sword,"
548,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And olives unadored,"
549,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Wisdom and love, white hands that save and slay,"
550,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him; and ye as they,"
551,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him, O gracious might of dews and rains"
552,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"That feed the purple plains,"
553,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O sacred sunbeams bright as bare steel drawn,"
554,JOSEPH MAZZINI,O cloud and fire and dawn;
555,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Red hills of flame, white Alps, green Apennines,"
556,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Banners of blowing pines,"
557,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Standards of stormy snows, flags of light leaves,"
558,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Three wherewith Freedom weaves
559,JOSEPH MAZZINI,One ensign that once woven and once unfurled
560,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Makes day of all a world,"
561,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Makes blind their eyes who knew not, and outbraves"
562,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The waste of iron waves;
563,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Ye fields of yellow fullness, ye fresh fountains,"
564,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And mists of many mountains;
565,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Ye moons and seasons, and ye days and nights;"
566,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Ye starry-headed heights,"
567,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And gorges melting sunward from the snow,"
568,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And all strong streams that flow,"
569,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Tender as tears, and fair as faith, and pure"
570,JOSEPH MAZZINI,As hearts made sad and sure
571,JOSEPH MAZZINI,At once by many sufferings and one love;
572,JOSEPH MAZZINI,O mystic deathless dove
573,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Held to the heart of earth and in her hands
574,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Cherished, O lily of lands,"
575,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"White rose of time, dear dream of praises past--"
576,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"For such as these thou wast,"
577,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"That art as eagles setting to the sun,"
578,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"As fawns that leap and run,"
579,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"As a sword carven with keen floral gold,"
580,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Sword for an armed god's hold,"
581,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Flower for a crowned god's forehead--O our land,"
582,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Reach forth thine holiest hand,"
583,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O mother of many sons and memories,"
584,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Stretch out thine hand to his
585,JOSEPH MAZZINI,That raised and gave thee life to run and leap
586,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"When thou wast full of sleep,"
587,JOSEPH MAZZINI,That touched and stung thee with young blood and breath
588,JOSEPH MAZZINI,When thou wast hard on death.
589,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him, O all her cities and her crowns,"
590,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Her towers and thrones of towns;
591,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O noblest Brescia, scarred from foot to head"
592,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And breast-deep in thy dead,"
593,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Praise him from all the glories of thy graves
594,JOSEPH MAZZINI,That yellow Mela laves
595,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"With gentle and golden water, whose fair flood"
596,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Ran wider with thy blood:
597,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him, O born of that heroic breast,"
598,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O nursed thereat and blest,"
599,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Verona, fairer than thy mother fair,"
600,JOSEPH MAZZINI,But not more brave to bear:
601,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him, O Milan, whose imperial tread"
602,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Bruised once the German head;
603,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Whose might, by northern swords left desolate,"
604,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Set foot on fear and fate:
605,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him, O long mute mouth of melodies,"
606,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Mantua, with louder keys,"
607,JOSEPH MAZZINI,With mightier chords of music even than rolled
608,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"From the large harps of old,"
609,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"When thy sweet singer of golden throat and tongue,"
610,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praising his tyrant, sung;"
611,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Though now thou sing not as of other days,"
612,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Learn late a better praise.
613,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Not with the sick sweet lips of slaves that sing,"
614,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise thou no priest or king,"
615,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"No brow-bound laurel of discoloured leaf,"
616,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"But him, the crownless chief."
617,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him, O star of sun-forgotten times,"
618,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Among their creeds and crimes
619,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"That wast a fire of witness in the night,"
620,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Padua, the wise men's light:"
621,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him, O sacred Venice, and the sea"
622,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"That now exults through thee,"
623,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Full of the mighty morning and the sun,"
624,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Free of things dead and done;
625,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him from all the years of thy great grief,"
626,JOSEPH MAZZINI,That shook thee like a leaf
627,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"With winds and snows of torment, rain that fell"
628,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Red as the rains of hell,"
629,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Storms of black thunder and of yellow flame,"
630,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And all ill things but shame;
631,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Praise him with all thy holy heart and strength;
632,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Through thy walls' breadth and length
633,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him with all thy people, that their voice"
634,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Bid the strong soul rejoice,"
635,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"The fair clear supreme spirit beyond stain,"
636,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Pure as the depth of pain,"
637,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"High as the head of suffering, and secure"
638,JOSEPH MAZZINI,As all things that endure.
639,JOSEPH MAZZINI,More than thy blind lord of an hundred years
640,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Whose name our memory hears,"
641,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Home-bound from harbours of the Byzantine
642,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Made tributary of thine,"
643,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him who gave no gifts from oversea,"
644,JOSEPH MAZZINI,But gave thyself to thee.
645,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O mother Genoa, through all years that run,"
646,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"More than that other son,"
647,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Who first beyond the seals of sunset prest
648,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Even to the unfooted west,"
649,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Whose back-blown flag scared from, their sheltering seas"
650,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"The unknown Atlantides,"
651,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And as flame climbs through cloud and vapour clomb
652,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Through streams of storm and foam,"
653,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Till half in sight they saw land heave and swim--
654,JOSEPH MAZZINI,More than this man praise him.
655,JOSEPH MAZZINI,One found a world new-born from virgin sea;
656,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And one found Italy.
657,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O heavenliest Florence, from the mouths of flowers"
658,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Fed by melodious hours,"
659,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"From each sweet mouth that kisses light and air,"
660,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Thou whom thy fate made fair,"
661,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"As a bound vine or any flowering tree,"
662,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Praise him who made thee free.
663,JOSEPH MAZZINI,For no grape-gatherers trampling out the wine
664,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Tread thee, the fairest vine;"
665,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"For no man binds thee, no man bruises, none"
666,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Does with thee as these have done.
667,JOSEPH MAZZINI,From where spring hears loud through her long lit vales
668,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Triumphant nightingales,"
669,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"In many a fold of fiery foliage hidden,"
670,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Withheld as things forbidden,"
671,JOSEPH MAZZINI,But clamorous with innumerable delight
672,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"In May's red, green, and white,"
673,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"In the far-floated standard of the spring,"
674,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"That bids men also sing,"
675,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Our flower of flags, our witness that we are free,"
676,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Our lamp for land and sea;
677,JOSEPH MAZZINI,From where Majano feels through corn and vine
678,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Spring move and melt as wine,"
679,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And Fiesole's embracing arms enclose
680,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The immeasurable rose;
681,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"From hill-sides plumed with pine, and heights wind-worn"
682,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"That feel the refluent morn,"
683,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Or where the moon's face warm and passionate
684,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Burns, and men's hearts grow great,"
685,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And the swoln eyelids labour with sweet tears,"
686,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And in their burning ears
687,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Sound throbs like flame, and in their eyes new light"
688,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Kindles the trembling night;
689,JOSEPH MAZZINI,From faint illumined fields and starry valleys
690,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Wherefrom the hill-wind sallies,"
691,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"From Vallombrosa, from Valdarno raise"
692,JOSEPH MAZZINI,One Tuscan tune of praise.
693,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O lordly city of the field of death,"
694,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him with equal breath,"
695,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"From sleeping streets and gardens, and the stream"
696,JOSEPH MAZZINI,That threads them as a dream
697,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Threads without light the untravelled ways of sleep
698,JOSEPH MAZZINI,With eyes that smile or weep;
699,JOSEPH MAZZINI,From the sweet sombre beauty of wave and wall
700,JOSEPH MAZZINI,That fades and does not fall;
701,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"From coloured domes and cloisters fair with fame,"
702,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Praise thou and thine his name.
703,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Thou too, O little laurelled town of towers,"
704,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Clothed with the flame of flowers,"
705,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"From windy ramparts girdled with young gold,"
706,JOSEPH MAZZINI,From thy sweet hillside fold
707,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Of wallflowers and the acacia's belted bloom
708,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And every blowing plume,"
709,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Halls that saw Dante speaking, chapels fair"
710,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"As the outer hills and air,"
711,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him who feeds the fire that Dante fed,"
712,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Our highest heroic head,"
713,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Whose eyes behold through floated cloud and flame
714,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The maiden face of fame
715,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Like April's in Valdelsa; fair as flowers,"
716,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And patient as the hours;
717,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Sad with slow sense of time, and bright with faith"
718,JOSEPH MAZZINI,That levels life and death;
719,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"The final fame, that with a foot sublime"
720,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Treads down reluctant time;
721,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"The fame that waits and watches and is wise,"
722,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"A virgin with chaste eyes,"
723,JOSEPH MAZZINI,A goddess who takes hands with great men's grief;
724,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise her, and him, our chief."
725,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him, O Siena, and thou her deep green spring,"
726,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O Fonte Branda, sing:"
727,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Shout from the red clefts of thy fiery crags,"
728,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Shake out thy flying flags
729,JOSEPH MAZZINI,In the long wind that streams from hill to hill;
730,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Bid thy full music fill
731,JOSEPH MAZZINI,The desolate red waste of sunset air
732,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And fields the old time saw fair,"
733,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"But now the hours ring void through ruined lands,"
734,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Wild work of mortal hands;
735,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Yet through thy dead Maremma let his name
736,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Take flight and pass in flame,"
737,JOSEPH MAZZINI,And the red ruin of disastrous hours
738,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Shall quicken into flowers.
739,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him, O fiery child of sun and sea,"
740,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Naples, who bade thee be;"
741,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"For till he sent the swords that scourge and save,"
742,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Thou wast not, but thy grave."
743,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"But more than all these praise him and give thanks,"
744,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Thou, from thy Tiber's banks,"
745,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"From all thine hills and from thy supreme dome,"
746,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praise him, O risen Rome."
747,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Let all thy children cities at thy knee
748,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Lift up their voice with thee,"
749,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Saying 'for thy love's sake and our perished grief
750,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"We laud thee, O our chief;'"
751,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Saying 'for thine  hand  and help when hope was dead
752,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"We thank thee, O our head;'"
753,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Saying 'for thy voice and face within our sight
754,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"We bless thee, O our light;"
755,JOSEPH MAZZINI,For waters cleansing us from days defiled
756,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"We praise thee, O our child.'"
757,JOSEPH MAZZINI,
758,JOSEPH MAZZINI,§
759,JOSEPH MAZZINI,So with an hundred cities' mouths in one
760,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Praising thy supreme son,"
761,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Son of thy sorrow, O mother, O maid and mother,"
762,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Our queen, who serve none other,"

766,JOSEPH MAZZINI,Now fallen before thy knees;
767,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Turn upon them thine eyes who hated thee,"
768,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Behold what things they be,"
769,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Italia: these are stubble that were steel,"
770,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Dust, or a turning wheel;"
771,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"As leaves, as snow, as sand, that were so strong;"
772,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And howl, for all their song,"
773,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And wail, for all their wisdom; they that were"
774,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"So great, they are all stript bare,"
775,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"They are all made empty of beauty, and all abhorred;"
776,JOSEPH MAZZINI,They are shivered and their sword;

779,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"O thou, soliciting with soul sublime"
780,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"The obscure soul of time,"
781,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Thou, with the wounds thy holy body bears"
782,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"From broken swords of theirs,"
783,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Thou, with the sweet swoln eyelids that have bled"
784,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"Tears for thy thousands dead,"
785,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"And upon these, whose swords drank up like dew"
786,JOSEPH MAZZINI,"The sons of thine they slew,"
