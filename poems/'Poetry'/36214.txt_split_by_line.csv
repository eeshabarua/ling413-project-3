55,TO MY FATHER,TO MY FATHER
56,TO MY FATHER,
57,TO MY FATHER,"Years can not cloud the light of your clear eyes,"
58,TO MY FATHER,Steadfast and bright with high integrity;
59,TO MY FATHER,Nor rob your spirit of the strength that lies
60,TO MY FATHER,On those firm lips; nor dim the purity
61,TO MY FATHER,"Of a high soul, which bears the shield of Love"
62,TO MY FATHER,"Untarnished, as it was upon the day"
63,TO MY FATHER,"When One, with tender faith, desired to prove"
64,TO MY FATHER,"Her ""Royal Knight,"" and gave her heart away."
65,TO MY FATHER,"Bear her bright shield, and smile, as years roll by--"
66,TO MY FATHER,Years that have crowned you with the priceless crown
67,TO MY FATHER,Of steadfast faith and worldwide charity--
68,TO MY FATHER,"Until you reap the joy that you have sown,"
69,TO MY FATHER,"In that near land, where, with a light divine,"
70,TO MY FATHER,The eyes you love through all the ages shine.

229,ACT I.,Scene I--The Forum.
230,ACT I.,
231,ACT I.,_A multitude of citizens gathered therein. Disturbance shown
232,ACT I.,"among them by sullen looks and murmurings. Four citizens, two in"
233,ACT I.,"patrician and two in plebeian garments, confer together._"
234,ACT I.,
235,ACT I.,"_1st Cit._ Enough, enough! I see we all agree"
236,ACT I.,Upon this common cause of our grievance;
237,ACT I.,"Our ranks, our unmixed blood, our differences,"
238,ACT I.,"Are all forgotten--nay, methinks they shall"
239,ACT I.,In time together mingle when our blood
240,ACT I.,Shall be poured forth in this most righteous cause.
241,ACT I.,
242,ACT I.,"_2nd Cit._ As ever art thou eloquent, O Marius,"
243,ACT I.,And just; Brutus himself were not more so.
244,ACT I.,"Patrician and plebeian, equalized"
245,ACT I.,"By common woe, together whisper menace"
246,ACT I.,"To those who work such havoc as, indeed,"
247,ACT I.,Was never known in Rome until to-day.
248,ACT I.,
249,ACT I.,"_3rd Cit._ Ye two are nobles; we, the commons are;"
250,ACT I.,Yet all are leveled by the grief we feel
251,ACT I.,"For Rome, our mother city, who so low"
252,ACT I.,Hath fall'n. Hark! the multitude itself
253,ACT I.,"Is wroth as we, yet, e'en as we, it lacks"
254,ACT I.,The courage needful for this fierce occasion.
255,ACT I.,
256,ACT I.,"_4th Cit._ Ay, list indeed! Mark how the murmur swells!"
257,ACT I.,
258,ACT I.,"[_They turn, and follow with their eyes the gaze of the Roman"
259,ACT I.,mob._
260,ACT I.,
261,ACT I.,"_Voices of lictors_ (_without_). Make way, ye Romans, way for the"
262,ACT I.,noble Ten!
263,ACT I.,
264,ACT I.,_3rd Cit._ Pah! they announce them like to royal kings!
265,ACT I.,
266,ACT I.,_1st Cit._ Tyrants are ceremonious to the letter.
267,ACT I.,
268,ACT I.,_Multitude._ All hail to the lawgivers! Life and peace
269,ACT I.,Unto the Ten!
270,ACT I.,
271,ACT I.,"_2nd Cit._ Jove's lightning strike them down,"
272,ACT I.,"The turncoats! Ah, the cowards and the curs!"
273,ACT I.,Perfidious gang of fawners! Do they thus
274,ACT I.,"Forget their wrongs in the wrongdoer's presence,"
275,ACT I.,"Or veil them with that slime, false loyalty?"
276,ACT I.,
277,ACT I.,"[_Enter the Ten Decemvirs, each preceded by twelve lictors armed"
278,ACT I.,with fasces._
279,ACT I.,
280,ACT I.,_4th Cit._ Lo! the presumption! How each lictor bears
281,ACT I.,Amongst his rods an axe to indicate
282,ACT I.,That life and death lie in his master's word.
283,ACT I.,Once was each tyrant pleased with one attendant
284,ACT I.,The way to clear--now must they number twelve.
285,ACT I.,
286,ACT I.,"[_The Decemvirs pause a space, the while their leader, Appius"
287,ACT I.,"Claudius, addresses the assembled citizens._"
288,ACT I.,
289,ACT I.,_Appius._ Ye Roman citizens! Unto our ears
290,ACT I.,Murmurings hath arrived laden with strife;
291,ACT I.,And though this day ye have protested loud
292,ACT I.,"Your loyalty, and hailed us with acclaim,"
293,ACT I.,Ye seem but ill-content. This must not be.
294,ACT I.,We have been lenient to every class--
295,ACT I.,What ye demand in reason ye receive.
296,ACT I.,"Ye called for written laws, and lo! they hang"
297,ACT I.,Within the Forum that all eyes may read.
298,ACT I.,"Yet, mark ye! Read not only, but obey,"
299,ACT I.,Else blood shall pour in torrents on these stones.
300,ACT I.,
301,ACT I.,"[_Low, angry murmur._"
302,ACT I.,
303,ACT I.,"What! would ye show your teeth, ye nobles brave,"
304,ACT I.,"Would bare your fangs, O ye plebeian dogs!"
305,ACT I.,"Your teeth are drawn, patricians, and your fangs"
306,ACT I.,"Are dull, indeed, ye curs!      [_A hissing protest._"
307,ACT I.,"What, open schism?"
308,ACT I.,"Ho, lictors, strike! Ah! would ye calmer grow?"
309,ACT I.,"Lictors, enough! Now must we on. Our time"
310,ACT I.,Is pressing.
311,ACT I.,
312,ACT I.,"[_As he is on the point of departing with his colleagues, his"
313,ACT I.,"gaze is arrested by the passing of a girl, clad all in white,"
314,ACT I.,"attended by her nurse, through the Forum._"
315,ACT I.,
316,ACT I.,"(_To a companion._) Now, by the ghost of Ixion, behold"
317,ACT I.,Yon perfect vision of most perfect beauty.
318,ACT I.,Enchanting grace! Exquisite featuring!
319,ACT I.,Youth lightly shadowed by young womanhood!
320,ACT I.,"My passions, Oppius, are all awake."
321,ACT I.,"Aflame and spreading fast! Why, I would burn"
322,ACT I.,"All Rome to own her, touch her, feel her near;"
323,ACT I.,"I would receive the curses of the gods,"
324,ACT I.,"Be hurled to lowest Hades, and endure"
325,ACT I.,The tortures set for Tantalus himself
326,ACT I.,If I might call her mine. Her kiss would prove
327,ACT I.,"Sufficient food for me, her liquid eyes"
328,ACT I.,Would quench my thirst if I should look within
329,ACT I.,And see the tears or draw the starry light
330,ACT I.,"Into my soul! O, Appius, ye are stricken!"
331,ACT I.,
332,ACT I.,"_Oppius._ Peace, peace, mine Appius, the maid is gone--"
333,ACT I.,"Thy looks are wild, thy features are convulsed"
334,ACT I.,With passion.
335,ACT I.,
336,ACT I.,"_1st Cit._ See, Hortensius, yon man?"
337,ACT I.,"What ails him? Like a madman is his gaze,"
338,ACT I.,And horrid is his flaming countenance.
339,ACT I.,
340,ACT I.,"_Oppius._ Come, brother, come, my colleague, let's away."
341,ACT I.,
342,ACT I.,"_Appius._ Hands off, O, foolish man, for I am dead"
343,ACT I.,To protest. I have been by lightning stricken.

684,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,Better to me this pleasure than the sight

1864,HYMN TO DIANA.,"O, thou virgin-goddess fair,"
1865,HYMN TO DIANA.,Look upon me in my sorrow;
1866,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Hear, oh, hear mine earnest prayer!"
1867,HYMN TO DIANA.,Guard me from the fatal morrow!
1868,HYMN TO DIANA.,Purity is in thy breast

1870,HYMN TO DIANA.,
1871,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Still my cheek is hot with shame,"
1872,HYMN TO DIANA.,And my heart in anguish crying;

1874,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Waking, sleeping, living, dying!"
1875,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Chaste Dian, thy stainless glory"

1878,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Mount thy ear within the blue,"
1879,HYMN TO DIANA.,Waft a whisper to me only!
1880,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Thou a heart hast, strong and true,"
1881,HYMN TO DIANA.,Think upon the maiden lonely.
1882,HYMN TO DIANA.,Without thee it now would seem

1890,HYMN TO DIANA.,_Virginia._ Ah! Thou!      [_Turns and embraces her._
1891,HYMN TO DIANA.,
1892,HYMN TO DIANA.,_Cor._ No other than this broken heart;
1893,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Yet is my soul untouched by human woe,"
1894,HYMN TO DIANA.,As thine shall be untouched by human sin.
1895,HYMN TO DIANA.,
1896,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Virginia._ I see the face, with passion fiery,"
1897,HYMN TO DIANA.,"The full voluptuous lips and greedy eyes,"

1909,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Allot _me_ as his own. (_Wildly._) I saw his look,"
1910,HYMN TO DIANA.,And felt his power! Marcus is the paw
1911,HYMN TO DIANA.,Wherewith great Appius will seize his prey.
1912,HYMN TO DIANA.,"(_Laughs._) Virginia, his prey! He leered on me,"
1913,HYMN TO DIANA.,And in the whitening of his clenchéd hand
1914,HYMN TO DIANA.,I marked the clash and clangor of his soul.
1915,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Dear gods! The feet of Night are leaden shod,"
1916,HYMN TO DIANA.,And yet the precious moments speed too fast.
1917,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Oh, Death! had I the courage that thou dost"

1923,HYMN TO DIANA.,
1924,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Virginia._ Dear one, thy voice is weary like the world,"
1925,HYMN TO DIANA.,Which is so old and heavy with its years;
1926,HYMN TO DIANA.,"And yet thine eyes are bright, undimmed by tears."
1927,HYMN TO DIANA.,
1928,HYMN TO DIANA.,_Cor._ Bright with the pain that kills by slow degrees.
1929,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Ah! for Apollo's pestilential dart,"
1930,HYMN TO DIANA.,Or but to see the shears of Atropos
1931,HYMN TO DIANA.,Flash in Diana's beams.
1932,HYMN TO DIANA.,
1933,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Virginia_ (_softly_). We loved her light,"

1954,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Life-bondage? Nay, methinks I am but mad."
1955,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Severed from _him_! Ah! lay me in my grave,"
1956,HYMN TO DIANA.,Rather than have my heart torn from my breast.
1957,HYMN TO DIANA.,
1958,HYMN TO DIANA.,[_Music is distantly heard._
1959,HYMN TO DIANA.,

1961,HYMN TO DIANA.,Mid the pure notes of music stealing on
1962,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Into my brain and sinking in my breast,"
1963,HYMN TO DIANA.,Enveloping my soul; or to the sound
1964,HYMN TO DIANA.,Of rushing wind--that music of the gods
1965,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Swept by Apollo's hand, or harking to"
1966,HYMN TO DIANA.,"The distant murmur of the restless sea,"
1967,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Striking its pearly harp of mystic sounds,"
1968,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Echoed within the caves where maidens dwell,"

1971,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Like the white foam their sire, Neptune, makes"

2012,HYMN TO DIANA.,"I hear a song which issues from the stars,"
