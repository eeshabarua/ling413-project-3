154,CURVES,"If you would view, buy tickets at the door."
155,CURVES,Your brain for lucre please! the fishes here
156,CURVES,"Require some effort on your part, no more,"
157,CURVES,For comprehension; then the water’s clear
158,CURVES,"And you will see, dimpling in hyaline"
159,CURVES,"Fish, oval, strange, glitter as rubied wine"
160,CURVES,"In crystal goblets; fish with spotted gills,"
161,CURVES,"Great flower-fish like open daffodils,"
162,CURVES,"Pale fish that float with mellow, morbid eyes,"
163,CURVES,"Dark fish that feed on wings of dragon flies,"
164,CURVES,"Fish fulvid and fugacious, hovering"
165,CURVES,"Amongst the silver cress with carmine wing,"
166,CURVES,And fish with small reticulated scales
167,CURVES,"Floundering mazed, with iridescent tails"
168,CURVES,Diaphanously quivering ...
169,CURVES,"Mad, necrophilic urchins cleft to trees"
170,CURVES,"Of coral, with a sting as keen as bees"
171,CURVES,When they would kiss you; fish electrical
172,CURVES,"And fish with poniards, fierce, inimical,"
173,CURVES,"Red fish that bark like mastiffs at the moon,"
174,CURVES,"Blue limpets, purple jellies, fish that croon"
175,CURVES,"Mauve, melancholy melodies, and fish"

181,CURVES,_A Day Will Come ..._
182,CURVES,
183,CURVES,
184,CURVES,The ultimate experiment performed
185,CURVES,To reach the planes of Mars and Jupiter
186,CURVES,Without discomfort. First-class passengers
187,CURVES,"With restaurants and Adam sitting rooms,"
188,CURVES,"Bathing and barbers, bars American"
189,CURVES,Could while away the slowly-dripping time.
190,CURVES,
191,CURVES,"Blast-furnaces and gasometers, yards"
192,CURVES,"Of bulky timber-joists and refuse-heaps,"
193,CURVES,"Pitch, cataclysmic mounds of dross and slag,"
194,CURVES,"Deep yawning pits, the seething pores of Hell,"
195,CURVES,"Slim towers of factories, vertiginous,"
196,CURVES,"Soul-traps to vitiate and brutalize,"
197,CURVES,To mould men bitter and recalcitrant ...
198,CURVES,The foul miasma of this atmosphere
199,CURVES,Confabulate in retching multitudes.
200,CURVES,
201,CURVES,"In tension rapt, awaiting holocausts;"
202,CURVES,"Mephitic and fuliginous, the sky--"
203,CURVES,Where green and yellow lights like demon’s eyes
204,CURVES,Blink through the murk; ideas as microbes flock
205,CURVES,"Half-garrotted; they struggle: “Air, more air!”"
206,CURVES,Spasmodic; then neurotically grasp
207,CURVES,A semi-groan before the strangulation.
208,CURVES,
209,CURVES,The hooters blare
210,CURVES,through air ...
211,CURVES,And women sigh
212,CURVES,"near by,"
213,CURVES,For husbands thrash;
214,CURVES,they lash
215,CURVES,"Gnarled, purple stripes."
216,CURVES,Oh Cripes!
217,CURVES,To bear a child
218,CURVES,is mild
219,CURVES,"Compared to it,"
220,CURVES,a pit
221,CURVES,"Of Hell is sweet,"
222,CURVES,the heat
223,CURVES,"Is soothing, calm"
224,CURVES,as balm.
225,CURVES,For what is home?
226,CURVES,"a tomb,"
227,CURVES,And men but wive
228,CURVES,to thrive;
229,CURVES,In hope they live
230,CURVES,to give
231,CURVES,"Despair or worse,"
232,CURVES,to curse
233,CURVES,The squalid life
234,CURVES,of wife
235,CURVES,"With travail fraught,"
236,CURVES,distraught.
237,CURVES,The hooters blare
238,CURVES,through air ...
239,CURVES,Obese black columns oscillate the streets.
240,CURVES,The hands troop out into the twilit hour
241,CURVES,"Like billion-herded emmets, dinosaurs"
242,CURVES,That crawl with crude disaster in their souls.
243,CURVES,"There; poised above, a lemon-rind of moon"
244,CURVES,"Recalls a youth of twitterings, desires"
245,CURVES,"For nacreous, warm flesh. Oh God! that life"
246,CURVES,Should filter so through factory machines.
247,CURVES,The ancient recrudescence; slowly-healed
248,CURVES,Wounds all unripped in agony again.
249,CURVES,Some lips are taut in bloodless nudity:
250,CURVES,Are they enhungered for the limbs of dead?
251,CURVES,No; they have savoured lust till they were lax
252,CURVES,"Of mind and body, with no palate for it"
253,CURVES,"For smooth, white thighs and hot, fierce mouths they feel"
254,CURVES,Naught else than heavy-lidded lassitude.
255,CURVES,
256,CURVES,All of a sudden voices rend the streets;
257,CURVES,"“Comrades, away! The spring is calling, haste"
258,CURVES,Ere we tear moon and stars from out the sky!”
259,CURVES,"The echoes give them courage, and the town"
260,CURVES,Becomes an archipelago of cries.
261,CURVES,Men hop and run as little children run
262,CURVES,Pink-naked on a curling yellow beach.
263,CURVES,"The women gaze from doorsteps, gorgon-eyed"
264,CURVES,And wonder what strange madness troubles them.
265,CURVES,"Sir Simon Moss, reclining in a chair,"
266,CURVES,With stout cigar held firm by regular
267,CURVES,"Well-ordered tusks of tooth, can hear the noise."
268,CURVES,Another war? to reap more profits in
269,CURVES,Exceeded mortal fortune. Nay; there blazed
270,CURVES,Some sorry plague. Perhaps the rabies gript ’em.
271,CURVES,Thus he pursues his reading of _The Times_.
272,CURVES,
273,CURVES,"Shrill voices fade, as stars in polychrome"
274,CURVES,"Fade on the cold, grey atmosphere of dawn."
275,CURVES,"“Comrades, away! the smack of wind is sweet”"
276,CURVES,Faint as the whisper of dim violins.
277,CURVES,"“Comrades, away ...” faint as the autumn leaves"
278,CURVES,(Burnt paper crackling gently on the breeze).
279,CURVES,"And houses humped like elephants asleep,"
280,CURVES,"Insolent hulks out-sprawled on many miles,"
281,CURVES,That muffled women’s sobs; for anxiously
282,CURVES,They feared the sons would follow in their wake.
283,CURVES,
284,CURVES,"And the sons followed; far away, the hills"
285,CURVES,"Exhaled a ripe, new life where no machines"
286,CURVES,Might pound away the frailly-cobwebbed air.
287,CURVES,To casual mossy stones and thistle weeds
288,CURVES,The city crumbled; now its walls lie bare
289,CURVES,As lidless eyes for crows to peck at them.
290,CURVES,And in the sloe-gin heat of summer days
291,CURVES,The sky’s enamel is not quite Limoges
292,CURVES,But almost; here and there a tiny scratch
293,CURVES,"Of soaring bird, some swallow on the wing"
294,CURVES,"Does irritate the surface. Sheer below,"
295,CURVES,"Fierce-biting on the edges, rise the trees;"
296,CURVES,Their taper-blossoms opulently lit
297,CURVES,As girandoles that smoulder silently
298,CURVES,Blue dust of incense; kohl-eyed evening
299,CURVES,Sponges the face with dripping fragrances.
300,CURVES,The vines and olives terraced on the hills
301,CURVES,"Melt on the dean horizon blurringly,"
302,CURVES,"Where clouds descend in deluge, liquid-gold."
303,CURVES,The flies fling flashes on cerulean meres
304,CURVES,Where steely bream and roach with rosy fins
305,CURVES,Goggle amongst the shrubberies of cress
306,CURVES,Half-dizzied by their vacant harmonies.
307,CURVES,The fruit of the wild gourd or hellebore
308,CURVES,Has tranced die sense of man; die moonlight leaks
309,CURVES,In silver puddles on the carpet-lawns.
310,CURVES,Dry thud of hooves; the satyrs have returned!
311,CURVES,
