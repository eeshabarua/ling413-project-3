116,ZIONISM:,ZIONISM:
117,ZIONISM:,to carry forward the cultural gene -
118,ZIONISM:,O bright-lit destiny of the chosen!
119,ZIONISM:,The child’s bouncing ball lands in mud
120,ZIONISM:,on the other side of the wire;
121,ZIONISM:,footsteps are paradoxical in a minefield.
122,ZIONISM:,"His heart ticks fast as a metal detector,"
123,ZIONISM:,"slowly, the yellow ball rolls to a stop."
124,ZIONISM:,Proposition: to advance onto ancestral
125,ZIONISM:,"territory, or return into gentle, familial lands,"
126,ZIONISM:,a footfall journey backward. His eye
127,ZIONISM:,shrinks the land to desert.
128,ZIONISM:,
129,ZIONISM:,
130,ZIONISM:,*
131,ZIONISM:,
132,ZIONISM:,
133,ZIONISM:,"You return to the stupa, yearly,"
134,ZIONISM:,to seek your return. You wish to
135,ZIONISM:,come back as forest deer but
136,ZIONISM:,that deer is extinct. The stupa is a rock
137,ZIONISM:,"upon which your dreams founder,"
138,ZIONISM:,"yearly, - you return that which"
139,ZIONISM:,"you do not have. Meanwhile, in the"
140,ZIONISM:,"West, under ragged skies and beneath a"
141,ZIONISM:,hundred spires no longer dreamt of -
142,ZIONISM:,attendance comes tumbling down;
143,ZIONISM:,"each stone, unturned, in an emptied"
144,ZIONISM:,space within a space caved under.
145,ZIONISM:,
146,ZIONISM:,
147,ZIONISM:,*
148,ZIONISM:,
149,ZIONISM:,
150,ZIONISM:,The stones collected. Ground
151,ZIONISM:,levelled and swept. The first cubicle
152,ZIONISM:,"erected with four windowed-walls,"
153,ZIONISM:,an open doorway. One man
154,ZIONISM:,on a step looking out to sea. Civilization
155,ZIONISM:,"open for business. Soon, marble"
156,ZIONISM:,was made smooth and square. The Idea
157,ZIONISM:,locked into permanence. Curiosity
158,ZIONISM:,stimulated commerce; others came and
159,ZIONISM:,conquered then went away.
160,ZIONISM:,That first step never forgotten became
161,ZIONISM:,a throne - history’s seat.
162,ZIONISM:,
163,ZIONISM:,
164,ZIONISM:,
165,ZIONISM:,*
166,ZIONISM:,
167,ZIONISM:,
168,ZIONISM:,"“With digital, there is no past,”"
169,ZIONISM:,"says Jean-Luc Godard. Either way,"
170,ZIONISM:,the button is redundant. Voice-command
171,ZIONISM:,is thought - the fear deep and futureless
172,ZIONISM:,"as history, desire to appease which"
173,ZIONISM:,"remains featureless, not the disorganized"
174,ZIONISM:,"weather it truly is, as much a part of"
175,ZIONISM:,the breathing stars as constancy of rock.
176,ZIONISM:,The ‘Mr Whippy Man’ weaves
177,ZIONISM:,Greensleeves in and out of suburbia; a
178,ZIONISM:,caravan in search of a trade-route -
179,ZIONISM:,via the village that never existed.
180,ZIONISM:,
181,ZIONISM:,
182,ZIONISM:,*
183,ZIONISM:,
184,ZIONISM:,
185,ZIONISM:,How is it the floating island
186,ZIONISM:,detaches itself from horizon in dream -
187,ZIONISM:,"its first appearance, otherworldly,"
188,ZIONISM:,"but of this world, a wheel loosened"
189,ZIONISM:,"from the world’s ratchet, out of time,"
190,ZIONISM:,riding above it and inhabited by
191,ZIONISM:,folk fixated upon a particular
192,ZIONISM:,"theorem-thought; elevated imponderables,"
193,ZIONISM:,whereby you access this island by door
194,ZIONISM:,set underneath as you sail under?
195,ZIONISM:,"Islands, a dream of round towers!"
196,ZIONISM:,the sudden rush of water under hulls.
197,ZIONISM:,
198,ZIONISM:,
199,ZIONISM:,
200,ZIONISM:,*
201,ZIONISM:,
202,ZIONISM:,
203,ZIONISM:,Mediocre raiders lie in wait.
204,ZIONISM:,"Teeth clack in sleep, dreams fraught"
205,ZIONISM:,"with ambush. Orders intercepted,"
206,ZIONISM:,encrypted to the house style.
207,ZIONISM:,The litterateur tracked back through
208,ZIONISM:,his ISBN to no man’s land -
209,ZIONISM:,"the robotic verb activated, sent"
210,ZIONISM:,in under barbed metaphor strung out
211,ZIONISM:,where trees once stood as
212,ZIONISM:,camouflage. The voices from his
213,ZIONISM:,hill-bunker a wind turbine. Accusations
214,ZIONISM:,tumbled in the night. For months he
215,ZIONISM:,"heard soft hammering, mimicry;"
216,ZIONISM:,they failed. Could not beat back the
217,ZIONISM:,weather on his chosen ground.
218,ZIONISM:,
219,ZIONISM:,
220,ZIONISM:,*
221,ZIONISM:,
222,ZIONISM:,
223,ZIONISM:,Time passes - that pressure in
224,ZIONISM:,space again - return of the unoriginals
225,ZIONISM:,tinkering with the power-box -
226,ZIONISM:,such fine work - setting traps out
227,ZIONISM:,for darkness. Time passes -
228,ZIONISM:,talons curve and hook - how the
229,ZIONISM:,mouth chokes with ash. Feet drag
230,ZIONISM:,muffled under dungeons. Time passes -
231,ZIONISM:,that pressure in space again - a
232,ZIONISM:,new proclamation from Semiotic City -
233,ZIONISM:,this custom built dome and
234,ZIONISM:,"aquarium light, pulsing: henceforth,"
235,ZIONISM:,no corners to hide around - no zone
236,ZIONISM:,permitted for surprise to leap.
237,ZIONISM:,
238,ZIONISM:,
239,ZIONISM:,*
240,ZIONISM:,
241,ZIONISM:,
242,ZIONISM:,"Hugely, our indifference squats -"
243,ZIONISM:,"unleavened as fear, blood is contained"
244,ZIONISM:,within news footage. Archaeologists
245,ZIONISM:,stop digging deserts because of
246,ZIONISM:,landmines. Camels wait for sand dunes
247,ZIONISM:,to drift into ridges - blue flags flutter
248,ZIONISM:,back at Fort Apache on brave
249,ZIONISM:,white trucks (what gets through
250,ZIONISM:,is the scent of coffee). A footless boy
251,ZIONISM:,"hobbles past, bargain hunting,"
252,ZIONISM:,a life at odds & ends - smoke drifts
253,ZIONISM:,"over Manhattan, out across the Hudson"
254,ZIONISM:,river as from a Bedouin campfire.
255,ZIONISM:,
256,ZIONISM:,
257,ZIONISM:,*
258,ZIONISM:,
259,ZIONISM:,
260,ZIONISM:,"Circuit; right hand wise,"
261,ZIONISM:,homage to the sun - as did ancient
262,ZIONISM:,"Celts, Scythians, too - host to"
263,ZIONISM:,the Milesians on their last leg to
264,ZIONISM:,Ireland as the first Celts castaway -
265,ZIONISM:,"whose home precinct the Black Sea,"
266,ZIONISM:,the right hand to the centre;
267,ZIONISM:,memoried in standing stone circles.
268,ZIONISM:,Yet homage to a sun as walking
269,ZIONISM:,"pillar of fire, with hell for a coronet?"
270,ZIONISM:,The world’s breath and mystery
271,ZIONISM:,"end here, earth’s innards engorged -"
272,ZIONISM:,sprawled redly coast to coast.
273,ZIONISM:,
274,ZIONISM:,
275,ZIONISM:,*
276,ZIONISM:,
277,ZIONISM:,
278,ZIONISM:,If streets had cobblestones
279,ZIONISM:,blood would flow in tatters - torn
280,ZIONISM:,flags to a revolution lost. Streets
281,ZIONISM:,"smoothly ease to drains. The cut deep,"
282,ZIONISM:,"and blood wakes from its blackness,"
283,ZIONISM:,crushed as berries in the runnels
284,ZIONISM:,"of a wagon, oozes its oil from"
285,ZIONISM:,the body’s casket - til flesh becomes
286,ZIONISM:,"porcelain, perfect surface for moon,"
287,ZIONISM:,"ice, the glass-edged sky to play upon;"
288,ZIONISM:,in silences deep as birch in the
289,ZIONISM:,bayoneting dark - and leaves finally
290,ZIONISM:,resemble paper money piled up
291,ZIONISM:,under the turbined lamplight.
292,ZIONISM:,
293,ZIONISM:,
294,ZIONISM:,*
295,ZIONISM:,
296,ZIONISM:,
297,ZIONISM:,A Public Works draughtsman
298,ZIONISM:,spent thirty years designing the City
299,ZIONISM:,Sewerage Reticulation System
300,ZIONISM:,he eventually hoped to escape through -
301,ZIONISM:,a masterpiece! A prairie dog would
302,ZIONISM:,have been proud of it. Complex of
303,ZIONISM:,"accented runs, angles, drops, sluices,"
304,ZIONISM:,"pumps, ditches, endless unbowed"
305,ZIONISM:,"archways, treatment ponds breaking into"
306,ZIONISM:,sunlight - the architects of Athens
307,ZIONISM:,would have been proud of it.
308,ZIONISM:,Only on paper - not one trowel lifted!
309,ZIONISM:,miles and miles and miles of it.
310,ZIONISM:,
311,ZIONISM:,

313,ZIONISM:,
314,ZIONISM:,
315,ZIONISM:,"Pyrrha, your dewy hair,"
316,ZIONISM:,"yellow, scented, doubly wreathed"
317,ZIONISM:,"in Jasmine, fresh from the trellis"
318,ZIONISM:,this morning - your new lover yet to
319,ZIONISM:,"arrive, breathless. Your tantrums"
320,ZIONISM:,"are as sea-storms, heart-wrecking"
321,ZIONISM:,for that unsuspecting voyager - maybe
322,ZIONISM:,"as survivor, I might warn him"
323,ZIONISM:,"against your squally lust, he won’t"
324,ZIONISM:,find safe haven in your arms! This note
325,ZIONISM:,is record enough - that I set down
326,ZIONISM:,against your lubricous hold.
327,ZIONISM:,
328,ZIONISM:,
329,ZIONISM:,"See: Horace’s ‘Pyrrha’ ode. I,v."

334,ZIONISM:,
335,ZIONISM:,"The flames above the wall,"
336,ZIONISM:,"private show for the Gods, the city"
337,ZIONISM:,"burned three days, at night, smoke"
338,ZIONISM:,warmed the stars. Border forest
339,ZIONISM:,"shifted with shields - scritch-owl,"
340,ZIONISM:,a horse’s impatient breath - the hawk
341,ZIONISM:,wheeled under a pennant moon.
342,ZIONISM:,In the grey dawn men turned North.
343,ZIONISM:,The druid notched these events
344,ZIONISM:,onto trunks that lead to deeper wood -
345,ZIONISM:,"envisioned - silence, incantation;"
346,ZIONISM:,the God found within the stone.

348,ZIONISM:,
349,ZIONISM:,*
350,ZIONISM:,
351,ZIONISM:,
352,ZIONISM:,Once cradle of civilization -
353,ZIONISM:,"now crucible, a sandstorm of tanks,"
354,ZIONISM:,a battery of rocket-launchers
355,ZIONISM:,each one bright as a guiding star
356,ZIONISM:,"slams home to its birth place, sand sprites"
357,ZIONISM:,"leap dervishly, limbs gad about,"
358,ZIONISM:,horses buckle back upon themselves -
359,ZIONISM:,empty out like exhausted bellows.
360,ZIONISM:,A beggar (in nameless rags) calls
361,ZIONISM:,out in either prayer or curse to
362,ZIONISM:,the desert night first refuge for saints;
363,ZIONISM:,Cross and Crescent belch fire.

369,ZIONISM:,Forty thousand tons. Space
370,ZIONISM:,"dust, diamond and sapphire, snips"
371,ZIONISM:,"of light, collect on earth yearly."
372,ZIONISM:,Dust breaks bread on our too dusty
373,ZIONISM:,planet; on our twice dusty planet;
374,ZIONISM:,on our overly dusty planet made
375,ZIONISM:,available to wind; dust breaks
376,ZIONISM:,down glaciers. Broken deserts from
377,ZIONISM:,"sand storms deliver dinosaur dust,"
378,ZIONISM:,"highways loosen tyre dust, your"
379,ZIONISM:,home a time capsule - our earth bent
380,ZIONISM:,dustward forsworn to decay.

383,ZIONISM:,*
384,ZIONISM:,
385,ZIONISM:,
386,ZIONISM:,A giallo antico moon framed

388,ZIONISM:,up at the edges like a dirty postcard.
389,ZIONISM:,"Poplars, broken spars of pine,"
390,ZIONISM:,cypress. Dusty plane trees rubbed raw
391,ZIONISM:,by abrading tanks in the market
392,ZIONISM:,square. Two ambulances shoved aside.
393,ZIONISM:,Kabul. The Republic of Georgia’s
394,ZIONISM:,snowy mountains [backdrop to some
395,ZIONISM:,desolate soccer field]. A few lean
396,ZIONISM:,men shouldering grenade launchers pass
397,ZIONISM:,"by and grin, heading for the glacire."

406,ZIONISM:,"urge these riots? Memory is dead,"
407,ZIONISM:,flags and banners dissolve back
408,ZIONISM:,into thoroughfares. The East
409,ZIONISM:,is reliquary; bone splinter and shrapnel
410,ZIONISM:,mixed in daily. What ghosts urge
411,ZIONISM:,these riots? Barbarism looms in
412,ZIONISM:,"the triumph of immediacy, a final exit"
413,ZIONISM:,"from the Garden of Eden, bombs"
414,ZIONISM:,bristling moments ago at cockcrow.

424,ZIONISM:,and final judgement; Alpha

430,ZIONISM:,that bloodies a sun; is gravity

871,ZIONISM:,
872,ZIONISM:,"Stephen Oliver’s anthology of 2001, Night of Warehouses, brought"
873,ZIONISM:,together the work of a poet who combines an astonishing facility for
874,ZIONISM:,"image with a complete assurance of voice, while showing a deep"
875,ZIONISM:,"engagement with the poetic tradition . Two new collections, Ballads,"
876,ZIONISM:,"Satire & Salt and Deadly Pollen, will do much to extend that"
877,ZIONISM:,reputation. The former is subtitled ‘A Book of Diversions’ and displays
878,ZIONISM:,"Oliver’s sardonic wit and verbal inventiveness, along with a fine set"
879,ZIONISM:,of illustrations by Matt Ottley. The book’s light verse moves from
880,ZIONISM:,political satire (‘Think Big’) to a series of reflections on the poets
881,ZIONISM:,"of this and the last generation, ranging from Larkin and Auden to the"
882,ZIONISM:,major figures in recent New Zealand writing. Wit explained is wit
883,ZIONISM:,"ruined, however, and so I shall not comment at length on what is an"
884,ZIONISM:,impressive work.
885,ZIONISM:,
886,ZIONISM:,"Oliver’s other new collection, Deadly Pollen, is an ambitious"
887,ZIONISM:,"undertaking - a meditation, in large measure, on Wallace Stevens and"
888,ZIONISM:,his legacy - and brings together thirty-five short lyrics into a
889,ZIONISM:,loosely linked sequence which examines the state of the world after
890,ZIONISM:,"9/11. And the poem is not ‘merely’ political, for it diagnoses a state"
891,ZIONISM:,"of spiritual malaise based on fear, a state of crisis in which the role"
892,ZIONISM:,"of the poet is in question. So far, so good. But if this is a crisis"
893,ZIONISM:,"poem, it is also a crisis in which (and this is my reservation) I find"
894,ZIONISM:,"it difficult to believe, though it has been the subject of much recent"
895,ZIONISM:,"American commentary. And in any case, there is also an enormous amount"
896,ZIONISM:,to admire in the language and in the range of reference.
897,ZIONISM:,
898,ZIONISM:,I can convey something of the fineness of Oliver’s craftsmanship in his
899,ZIONISM:,"translation of Horace’s ‘Pyrrha’ ode, a translation which fits into"
900,ZIONISM:,"Oliver’s theme of disillusionment, and of his modernist distrust of"
901,ZIONISM:,"beauty in person and in diction. The quiet intensity, and the"
902,ZIONISM:,"distanced, almost intellectualized sensuality, of the language in which"
903,ZIONISM:,"Oliver brings alive the golden-haired Pyrrha, Horace’s femme fatale, is"
904,ZIONISM:,perfect:
905,ZIONISM:,
906,ZIONISM:,"Pyrrha, your dewy hair,"
907,ZIONISM:,"yellow, scented, doubly wreathed"
908,ZIONISM:,"in Jasmine, fresh from the trellis"
909,ZIONISM:,this morning.... (lyric 12)
910,ZIONISM:,
911,ZIONISM:,
912,ZIONISM:,"Nor is Oliver’s ambition here  as limited as it might seem, for in"
913,ZIONISM:,taking on such a translation Oliver is setting himself up against a
914,ZIONISM:,"history of translations,  and most notably one by Milton. It is a"
915,ZIONISM:,challenge in which he succeeds admirably.  And in the later lines of
916,ZIONISM:,"the lyric,  Oliver marks his disengagement  by a withdrawal into a more"
917,ZIONISM:,demotic register.  For while he is adept at finding occasion for the
918,ZIONISM:,"lyrical richness of which modernism was always suspicious, he also"
919,ZIONISM:,"writes at times in a spare modern voice,  as in the following lines"
920,ZIONISM:,which may owe something to the New Zealand poet Curnow’s ‘Canto of
921,ZIONISM:,Signs’:
922,ZIONISM:,
923,ZIONISM:,Rubbed off sky exposes an
924,ZIONISM:,undercoat of white that is really
925,ZIONISM:,"fuzzed, mid-day heat. Birds"
926,ZIONISM:,change over shifts. Things settle.
927,ZIONISM:,"Shadow drops under eaves, tier"
928,ZIONISM:,by tier .... (lyric 32)
929,ZIONISM:,
930,ZIONISM:,
931,ZIONISM:,"The language here has a powerful antipodean flatness, and depends on"
932,ZIONISM:,"its laconic pauses. And if ‘things settle’, it is because, as the"
933,ZIONISM:,"allusion to Yeats suggests,  things are about to fall apart;  and we"
934,ZIONISM:,move to images of Bali. Oliver goes on in a following lyric to
935,ZIONISM:,"demonstrate his gift for image, in his intense visualization of"
936,ZIONISM:,"Spring’s strange bloom, the terrorist’s bomb:"
937,ZIONISM:,
938,ZIONISM:,"Compression of bees,"
939,ZIONISM:,"shrub-shaped, in proton loops,"
940,ZIONISM:,on cushioned air. Spring!
941,ZIONISM:,"See the counter, its bright ticking"
942,ZIONISM:,with fail-safe growth. (lyric 34)
943,ZIONISM:,
944,ZIONISM:,
945,ZIONISM:,Political poets do not always manage to capture so well the
946,ZIONISM:,estrangement which is necessary for successful social comment.
947,ZIONISM:,
948,ZIONISM:,"Similarly, Oliver demonstrates an unsettled verbal mastery in a bravura"
949,ZIONISM:,"display, a  description of architectural form:"
950,ZIONISM:,
951,ZIONISM:,... Complex of
952,ZIONISM:,"accented runs, angles, drops, sluices,"
953,ZIONISM:,"pumps, ditches, endless unbowed"
954,ZIONISM:,archways... (lyric 11)
955,ZIONISM:,
956,ZIONISM:,
957,ZIONISM:,"The language here is finely controlled,  from the way in which the ‘x’"
958,ZIONISM:,"sound is perfectly balanced in the opening phrase, to the series of"
959,ZIONISM:,falling monosyllables which are released in the enjambed expansiveness
960,ZIONISM:,of the final phrase with its open vowels. The language is reminiscent
961,ZIONISM:,of Les Murray’s ‘Bent Water’ (surely Murray’s masterpiece). But the
962,ZIONISM:,"lines I have just quoted continue in rhythms which, while still"
963,ZIONISM:,"lyrical, are also more unsettling: ‘archways, treatment ponds breaking"
964,ZIONISM:,into/sunlight’. For where Murray’s language embodies a confident belief
965,ZIONISM:,"in God, Oliver’s has been a celebration of a public sewer - and more to"
966,ZIONISM:,"the point, a sewer envisioned but (in an act of creative failure) never"
967,ZIONISM:,built.
968,ZIONISM:,
969,ZIONISM:,"Late in the poem,  Oliver  brings together these themes in a grim"
970,ZIONISM:,reflection upon the role of the poet - in a voice in which the emotion
971,ZIONISM:,is italicized but never allowed to run outside its bounds:
972,ZIONISM:,
973,ZIONISM:,"One quadrant of sky turns,"
974,ZIONISM:,"face up, black as the ace of spades."
975,ZIONISM:,Much as a God can manage
976,ZIONISM:,muttering from the side of his mouth.
977,ZIONISM:,"Star flecks, nova spittle. Rage of"
978,ZIONISM:,"emptiness pours through, for the hell"
979,ZIONISM:,"of it, endlessly. Looking back to"
980,ZIONISM:,what beginning. The whole shebang
981,ZIONISM:,"advances toward, beyond our"
982,ZIONISM:,best efforts. We live under a Niagra
983,ZIONISM:,"of star fall, huge optics dilate time,"
984,ZIONISM:,blackness like velvet slips over
985,ZIONISM:,chrome. Sounds of nothingness
986,ZIONISM:,strung between a singlet of lights.  (lyric 30).
987,ZIONISM:,
988,ZIONISM:,
989,ZIONISM:,"This is vintage Oliver. The language is elaborate, but perfectly"
990,ZIONISM:,"judged, undercut by a colloquial impulse (‘black as the ace of spades’,"
991,ZIONISM:,‘for the hell
992,ZIONISM:,/ of it’). This undersong speaks of Oliver’s awareness of his place as
993,ZIONISM:,/ a poet
994,ZIONISM:,"of the vernacular republic; but it also speaks, in its use of cliche,"
995,ZIONISM:,of a loss of faith in the resources of poetic language.
996,ZIONISM:,
997,ZIONISM:,"And something similar can be said of its use of Stevens, for where"
998,ZIONISM:,Stevens is the poet who brought romantic metaphysics to its final
999,ZIONISM:,"crisis, and with it the end of any hope of finding essential meaning in"
1000,ZIONISM:,"the world, Oliver’s use of Stevens here seems also an act of deliberate"
1001,ZIONISM:,"failure. The stanza alludes to Stevens’s Jove, a false divinity who"
1002,ZIONISM:,"‘moved among us, as a muttering king’ in ‘Sunday Morning’, and to that"
1003,ZIONISM:,poem’s existential conclusion that (contra Milton) ‘We live in an old
1004,ZIONISM:,"chaos of the sun’. Like Stevens in ‘Key West’, Oliver laments the"
1005,ZIONISM:,"‘Blessed rage for order’, the ‘glassy lights’ which gave a bogus sense"
1006,ZIONISM:,"of structure to the sea. But in a sense, and an important sense, much"
1007,ZIONISM:,of the language of Oliver’s stanza is the language of Stevens: it is an
1008,ZIONISM:,eloquent testament to a failure to find in the present a viable voice
1009,ZIONISM:,for poetry.
1010,ZIONISM:,
1011,ZIONISM:,"Clearly there is much in this sequence which I find powerful, and"
1012,ZIONISM:,"respond to warmly. Many of the lyrics are perfect, and thematically the"
1013,ZIONISM:,poem traverses many of the issues which are at the heart of poetry
1014,ZIONISM:,today: from the modernist legacy of deep worries over memory and
1015,ZIONISM:,"metaphor, to a more contemporary juxtaposition of dictions and"
1016,ZIONISM:,"registers, and a concern with post-modernism and the end of history. It"
1017,ZIONISM:,"is a sequence which is not afraid to take on Stevens, or Milton and"
1018,ZIONISM:,"Hardy and Auden. But I would like to see it slightly reshaped, for I"
1019,ZIONISM:,"feel that there is a great poem hiding in here somewhere, if only I"
1020,ZIONISM:,could be persuaded more of its motivation. I think fear does lie at the
1021,ZIONISM:,"heart of its psychology, but the real fear is artistic rather than"
1022,ZIONISM:,political; and if this could be worked more into the texture of the
1023,ZIONISM:,"poem, along with some editing of the poem’s middle section, we would"
1024,ZIONISM:,"have a major achievement not only in Oliver’s oeuvre, but in antipodean"
1025,ZIONISM:,writing.
