38,PREFACE,
39,I,I
40,I,
41,I,The second half of the nineteenth and the first fifteen years of the
42,I,"twentieth century have been a period of research, of experiment, of"
43,I,unrest and questioning. In science and philosophy we have witnessed an
44,I,attempt to destroy the mechanistic theory of the universe as developed
45,I,"by Darwin, Huxley, and Spencer. The unknowable has been questioned:"
46,I,hypotheses have been shaken: vitalism and idealism have been proclaimed.
47,I,"In the arts, the tendency has been to strip each art of its inessentials"
48,I,"and to disclose the underlying basis of pure form. In life, the"
49,I,"principles of nationality, of racial culture, of individualism, of"
50,I,"social development, of Christian ethics, have been discussed, debated,"
51,I,"and examined from top to bottom, until at last, in the early years of"
52,I,"the twentieth century we find all Europe, from the leaders of thought"
53,I,"down to the lowest peasantry, engaged in a mutually destructive war of"
54,I,which few can trace the beginnings and none can foresee the end. The
55,I,"fundamental tenets of thought, art, life itself, have been shaken: and"
56,I,"either civilization is destined to some new birth, or mankind will"
57,I,"revert to the conditions of life, thought, and social intercourse that"
58,I,prevailed in the Stone Age.
59,I,
60,I,"Like all men of my generation, I have not been able to resist this"
61,I,"irresistible upheaval of ideas and of forces: and, to the best of my"
62,I,"ability, I have tried to arrive at a clear understanding of the"
63,I,fundamentals of æsthetic form as they affect the art to which I have
64,I,"felt myself instinctively akin, the art of poetry. That I have"
65,I,"completely attained such an understanding, it would be idle for me to"
66,I,"pretend: but I believe, and have induced some others to believe, that I"
67,I,have made a few steps towards it. Some explanation of my own peculiar
68,I,"theories and beliefs is necessary, however, to those who have not"
69,I,"specifically concerned themselves with poetry, or who suffer in the"
70,I,presence of any new work of art from the normal human reaction that all
71,I,art principles are so essentially fixed that any departure from accepted
72,I,ideas is madness.
73,I,
74,I,
75,II,II
76,II,
77,II,The fundamental basis of all the arts is the same. In every case art
78,II,aims at the evocation of some human emotion in the spectator or
79,II,"listener. Where science proceeds from effects to causes, and seeks to"
80,II,"analyze the underlying causes of emotion and sensation, art reverses the"
81,II,"process, and constructs something that will awaken emotions, according"
82,II,to the amount of receptiveness with which other people approach it. Thus
83,II,"architecture gives us feelings of density, proportion, harmony:"
84,II,"sculpture, of masses in movement; painting, of colour-harmony and the"
85,II,ordered composition of lines and volumes from which arise sensations of
86,II,"space: music, of the development of sounds into melodic line, harmonic"
87,II,"progression, tonal opposition, and symphonic structure."
88,II,
89,II,The object of literature is not dissimilar from these. Literature aims
90,II,at releasing the emotions that arise from the formed words of a certain
91,II,language. But literature is probably a less pure--and hence more
92,II,universal--art than any I have yet examined. For it must be apparent to
93,II,"all minds that not only is a word a definite symbol of some fact, but"
94,II,also it is a thing capable of being spoken or sounded. The art of
95,II,"literature, then, in so far as it deals with definite statements, is"
96,II,akin to painting or photography: in so far as it deals with sounded
97,II,"words, it is akin to music."
98,II,
99,II,
100,III,III
101,III,
102,III,"Literature, therefore, does not depend on the peculiar twists and quirks"
103,III,"which represent, to those who can read, the words, but rather on the"
104,III,"essential words themselves. In fact, literature existed before writing;"
105,III,"and writing in itself is of no value from the purely literary sense,"
106,III,except in so far as it preserves and transmits from generation to
107,III,"generation the literary emotion. Style, whether in prose or poetry, is"
108,III,"an attempt to develop this essentially musical quality of literature, to"
109,III,"evoke the magic that exists in the sound-quality of words, as well as"
110,III,to combine these sound-qualities in definite statements or sentences.
111,III,"The difference between prose and poetry is, therefore, not a difference"
112,III,"of means, but of psychological effect and reaction. The means employed,"
113,III,"the formed language, is the same: but the resultant impression is quite"
114,III,different.
115,III,
116,III,"In prose, the emotions expressed are those that are capable of"
117,III,"development in a straight line. In so far as prose is pure, it confines"
118,III,itself to the direct orderly progression of a thought or conception or
119,III,"situation from point to point of a flat surface. The sentences, as they"
120,III,"develop this conception from its beginning to conclusion, move on, and"
121,III,do not return upon themselves. The grouping of these sentences into
122,III,"paragraphs gives the breadth of the thought. The paragraphs, sections,"
123,III,"and chapters are each a square, in that they represent a division of the"
124,III,"main thought into parallel units, or blocks of subsidiary ideas. The"
125,III,sensation of depth is finally obtained by arranging these blocks in a
126,III,"rising climacteric progression, or in parallel lines, or in a sort of"
127,III,zigzag figure.
128,III,
129,III,The psychological reaction that arises from the intelligent appreciation
130,III,"of poetry is quite different. In poetry, we have a succession of curves."
131,III,"The direction of the thought is not in straight lines, but wavy and"
132,III,spiral. It rises and falls on gusts of strong emotion. Most often it
133,III,creates strongly marked loops and circles. The structure of the stanza
134,III,or strophe always tends to the spherical. Depth is obtained by making
135,III,"one sphere contain a number of concentric, or overlapping spheres."
136,III,
137,III,"Hence, when we speak of poetry we usually mean regular rhyme and metre,"
138,III,"which have for so long been considered essential to all poetry, not as a"
139,III,"device for heightening musical effect, as so many people suppose, but"
140,III,"merely to make these loops and circles more accentuated, and to make the"
141,III,line of the poem turn upon itself more recognizably. But it must be
142,III,"recognized that just as Giotto's circle was none the less a circle,"
143,III,"although not drawn with compasses, so poetic circles can be constructed"
144,III,out of subtler and more musical curves than that which painstakingly
145,III,"follows the selfsame progression of beats, and catches itself up on the"
146,III,same point of rhyme for line after line. The key pattern on the lip of a
147,III,"Greek vase may be beautiful, but it is less beautiful, less satisfying,"
148,III,and less conclusive a test of artistic ability than the composition of
149,III,"satyrs and of mænads struggling about the centre. Therefore I maintain,"
150,III,"and will continue to do so, that the mere craftsman-ability to write in"
151,III,regular lines and metres no more makes a man a poet than the ability to
152,III,stencil wall-papers makes him a painter.
153,III,
154,III,Rather is it more important to observe that almost any prose work of
155,III,"imaginative literature, if examined closely, will be found to contain a"
156,III,plentiful sprinkling of excellent verses; while many poems which the
157,III,"world hails as master-pieces, contain whole pages of prose. The fact is,"
158,III,that prose and poetry are to literature as composition and colour are
159,III,"to painting, or as light and shadow to the day, or male and female to"
160,III,mankind. There are no absolutely perfect poets and no absolutely perfect
161,III,prose-writers. Each partakes of some of the characteristics of the
162,III,"other. The difference between poetry and prose is, therefore, a"
163,III,difference between a general roundness and a general squareness of
164,III,"outline. A great French critic, recently dead, who devoted perhaps the"
165,III,major part of his life to the study of the æsthetics of the French
166,III,"tongue, declared that Flaubert and Chateaubriand wrote only poetry. If"
167,III,there are those who cannot see that in the only true and lasting sense
168,III,"of the word poetry, this remark was perfectly just, then all I have"
169,III,written above will be in vain.
170,III,
171,III,
172,IV,IV
173,IV,
174,IV,Along with the prevailing preoccupation with technique which so marks
175,IV,"the early twentieth century, there has gone also a great change in the"
176,IV,subject-matter of art. Having tried to explain the aesthetic form-basis
177,IV,"of poetry, I shall now attempt to explain my personal way of viewing its"
178,IV,content.
179,IV,
180,IV,It is a significant fact that every change in technical procedure in the
181,IV,"arts is accompanied by, and grows out of, a change in subject-matter. To"
182,IV,"take only one out of innumerable examples, the new subject-matter of"
183,IV,"Wagner's music-dramas, of an immeasurably higher order than the usual"
184,IV,"libretto, created a new form of music, based on motifs, not melodies."
185,IV,Other examples can easily be discovered. The reason for this is not
186,IV,difficult to find.
187,IV,
188,IV,No sincere artist cares to handle subject-matter that has already been
189,IV,handled and exhausted. It is not a question of a desire to avoid
190,IV,"plagiarism, or of self-conscious searching for novelty, but of a"
191,IV,perfectly spontaneous and normal appeal which any new subject-matter
192,IV,"always makes. Hence, when a new subject appears to any artist, he always"
193,IV,"realizes it more vividly than an old one, and if he is a good artist, he"
194,IV,realizes it so vividly that he recreates it in what is practically a
195,IV,novel form.
196,IV,
197,IV,"This novel form never is altogether novel, nor is the subject altogether"
198,IV,"a new subject. For, as I pointed out at the beginning of this preface,"
199,IV,"that all arts sprang practically out of the same primary sensations, so"
200,IV,"the subject-matter of all art must forever be the same: namely, nature"
201,IV,"and human life. Hence, any new type of art will always be found, in"
202,IV,"subject-matter as well as in technique, to have its roots in the old."
203,IV,"Art is like a kaleidoscope, capable of many changes, while the material"
204,IV,which builds up those changes remains the same.
205,IV,
206,IV,"Nevertheless, although the subject-matter in this book is not altogether"
207,IV,"new, yet I have realized it in a way which has not often been tried, and"
208,IV,out of that fresh and quite personal realization have sprung my
209,IV,innovations in subject as well as technique. Let me illustrate by a
210,IV,concrete example.
211,IV,
212,IV,
213,V,V
214,V,
215,V,A book lies on my desk. It has a red binding and is badly printed on
216,V,"cheap paper. I have had this book with me for several years. Now,"
217,V,"suppose I were to write a poem on this book, how would I treat the"
218,V,subject?
219,V,
220,V,"If I were a poet following in the main the Victorian tradition, I should"
221,V,write my poem altogether about the contents of this book and its author.
222,V,My poem would be essentially a criticism of the subject-matter of the
223,V,book. I should state at length how that subject-matter had affected me.
224,V,"In short, what the reader would obtain from this sort of poem would be"
225,V,my sentimental reaction towards certain ideas and tendencies in the work
226,V,of another.
227,V,
228,V,"If I were a realist poet, I should write about the book's external"
229,V,"appearance. I should expatiate on the red binding, the bad type, the"
230,V,"ink-stain on page sixteen. I should complain, perhaps, of my poverty at"
231,V,"not being able to buy a better edition, and conclude with a gibe at the"
232,V,author for not having realized the sufferings of the poor.
233,V,
234,V,"Neither of these ways, however, of writing about this book possesses any"
235,V,"novelty, and neither is essentially my own way. My own way of writing"
236,V,about it would be as follows:--
237,V,
238,V,I should select out of my life the important events connected with my
239,V,"ownership of this book, and strive to write of them in terms of the"
240,V,"volume itself, both as regards subject-matter and appearance. In other"
241,V,"words, I should link up my personality and the personality of the book,"
242,V,and make each a part of the other. In this way I should strive to evoke
243,V,"a soul out of this piece of inanimate matter, a something characteristic"
244,V,and structural inherent in this in-organic form which is friendly to me
245,V,and responds to my mood.
246,V,
247,V,"This method is not new, although it has not often been used in"
248,V,"Occidental countries. Professor Fenollosa, in his book on Chinese and"
249,V,"Japanese art, states that it was universally employed by the Chinese"
250,V,artists and poets of the Sung period in the eleventh century A.D. He
251,V,"calls this doctrine of the interdependence of man and inanimate nature,"
252,V,the cardinal doctrine of Zen Buddhism. The Zen Buddhists evolved it from
253,V,"the still earlier Taoist philosophy, which undoubtedly inspired Li Po"
254,V,and the other great Chinese poets of the seventh and eighth centuries
255,A.D.,A.D.
256,A.D.,
257,A.D.,
258,VI,VI
259,VI,
260,VI,"In the first poems of this volume, the ""Ghosts of an Old House,"" I have"
261,VI,"followed the method already described. I have tried to evoke, out of the"
262,VI,"furniture and surroundings of a certain old house, definite emotions"
263,VI,which I have had concerning them. I have tried to relate my childish
264,VI,"terror concerning this house--a terror not uncommon among children, as I"
265,VI,can testify--to the aspects that called it forth.
266,VI,
267,VI,"In the ""Symphonies,"" which form the second part of this volume, I have"
268,VI,"gone a step further. My aim in writing these was, from the beginning, to"
269,VI,narrate certain important phases of the emotional and intellectual
270,VI,"development--in short, the life--of an artist, not necessarily myself,"
271,VI,but of that sort of artist with which I might find myself most in
272,VI,"sympathy. And here, not being restrained by any definite material"
273,VI,"phenomena, as in the Old House, I have tried to state each phase in the"
274,VI,"terms of a certain colour, or combination of colours, which is"
275,VI,"emotionally akin to that phase. This colour, and the imaginative"
276,VI,"phantasmagoria of landscape which it evokes, thereby creates, in a"
277,VI,"definite and tangible form, the dominant mood of each poem."
278,VI,
279,VI,"The emotional relations that exist between form, colour, and sound have"
280,VI,been little investigated. It is perfectly true that certain colours
281,VI,affect certain temperaments differently. But it is also true that there
282,VI,"is a science of colour, and that certain of its laws are already"
283,VI,"universally known, if not explained. Naturally enough, it is to the"
284,VI,painters we must first turn if we want to find out what is known about
285,VI,colour. We discover that painters continually are speaking of hot and
286,VI,"cold colour: red, yellow, orange being generally hot, and green, blue,"
287,VI,and violet cold--mixed colours being classed hot and cold according to
288,VI,the proportions they contain of the hot and cold colours. We also
289,VI,"discover that certain colours will not fit certain forms, but rebel at"
290,VI,the combination. This is so far true that scarcely any landscape painter
291,VI,"finishes his pictures from nature, but in the studio: and almost any art"
292,VI,"student, painting a landscape, will disregard the colour before him and"
293,VI,employ the colour-scheme of his master or of some painter he admires. As
294,VI,"Delacroix noted in his journal: ""A conception having become a"
295,VI,composition must move in the milieu of a colour peculiar to it. There
296,VI,seems to be a particular tone belonging to some part of every picture
297,VI,"which is a key that governs all the other tones."""
298,VI,
299,VI,"Therefore, we must admit that there is an intimate relation between"
300,VI,colour and form. It is the same with colour and sounds. Many musicians
301,VI,"have observed the phenomenon, that when certain notes, or combinations"
302,VI,"of them, are sounded, certain colours are also suggested to the eye. A"
303,VI,"Russian composer, Scriabine, went so far as to construct colour-scales,"
304,VI,"and an English scientist, Professor Wallace Rimington, has built an"
305,VI,"organ which plays in colours, instead of notes. Unfortunately, the"
306,VI,"musicians have given this subject less attention than the painters, and"
307,VI,therefore our knowledge concerning the relations of colour and sound is
308,VI,"more fragmentary and incomplete. Nevertheless, these relations exist,"
309,VI,and it is for the future to develop them more fully.
310,VI,
311,VI,"Literature, and especially poetry, as I have already pointed out,"
312,VI,partakes of the character of both painting and music. The impressionist
313,VI,method is quite as applicable to writing as it is to landscape. Poems
314,VI,"can be written in major or minor keys, can be as full of dominant motif"
315,VI,"as a Wagner music-drama, and even susceptible of fugal treatment."
316,VI,"Literature is the common ground of many arts, and in its highest"
317,VI,"development, such as the drama as practised in fifth-century Athens, is"
318,VI,"found allied to music, dancing, and colour. Hence, I have called my"
319,VI,"works ""Symphonies,"" when they are really dramas of the soul, and hence,"
320,VI,"in them I have used colour for verity, for ornament, for drama, for its"
321,VI,"inherent beauty, and for intensifying the form of the emotion that each"
322,VI,of these poems is intended to evoke.
323,VI,
324,VI,
325,VII,VII
326,VII,
327,VII,"Let us take an artist, a young man at the outset of his career. His"
328,VII,"years of searching, of fumbling, of other men's influence, are coming to"
329,VII,"an end. Sure of himself, he yet sees that he will spend all his life"
330,VII,pursuing a vision of beauty which will elude him at the very last. This
331,VII,"is the first symphony, which I have called the ""Blue,"" because blue"
332,VII,"suggests to me depth, mystery, and distance."
333,VII,
334,VII,"He finds himself alone in a great city, surrounded by noise and"
335,VII,"clamour. It is as if millions of lives were tugging at him, drawing him"
336,VII,"away from his art, tempting him to go out and whelm his personality in"
337,VII,"this black whirlpool of struggle and failure, on which float golden"
338,VII,specks--the illusory bliss of life. But he sees that all this is only
339,VII,"another illusion, like his own. Here we have the ""Symphony in Black and"
340,VII,"Gold."""
341,VII,
342,VII,"He emerges from the city, and in the country is re-intoxicated with"
343,VII,desire for life by spring. He vows himself to a self-sufficing pagan
344,VII,"worship of nature. This is the ""Green Symphony."""
345,VII,
346,VII,"Quickened by spring, he dreams of a marvellous golden city of art, fall"
347,VII,of fellow-workers. This city appears to him at times like some Italian
348,VII,"town of the Renaissance, at others like some strange Oriental"
349,VII,golden-roofed monastery-temple. He sees himself dead in the desert far
350,VII,away from it. Yet its blossoming is ever about him. Something divine has
351,VII,been born of him after death.
352,VII,
353,VII,"So he passes to the ""White Symphony,"" the central poem of this series,"
354,VII,in which I have sought to describe the artist's struggle to attain
355,VII,unutterable and superhuman perfection. This struggle goes on from the
356,VII,midsummer of his life to midwinter. The end of it is stated in the poem.
357,VII,
358,VII,"There follows a brief interlude, which I have called a ""Symphony in"
359,VII,"White and Blue."" These colours were chosen perhaps more"
360,VII,idiosyncratically in this case than in the others. I have tried to
361,VII,depict the sort of temptation that besets most artists at this stage of
362,VII,their career: the temptation to abandon the struggle for the sake of a
363,VII,"purely sensual existence. In this case, however, the appeal of"
364,VII,"sensuality is conveyed under the guise of a dream. It is resisted, and"
365,VII,the struggle begins anew.
366,VII,
367,VII,"War breaks out, not alone in the external world, but in the artist's"
368,VII,"soul. He finds he must follow his personality wherever it leads him,"
369,VII,"despite all obstacles. This is the ""Orange Symphony."""
370,VII,
371,VII,"Now follow long years of struggle and neglect. He is shipwrecked, and"
372,VII,"still afar he sees his city of art, but this time it is red, a phantom"
373,VII,mocking his impotent rage.
374,VII,
375,VII,"Old age follows. All is violet, the colour of regret and remembrance. He"
376,VII,"is living only in the past, his life a succession of dreams."
377,VII,
378,VII,"Lastly, all things fade out into absolute grey, and it is now midwinter."
379,VII,"Looking forth on the world again he still sees war, like a monstrous red"
380,VII,"flower, dominating mankind. He hears the souls of the dead declaring"
381,VII,"that they, too, have died for an adventure, even as he is about to die."
382,VII,
383,VII,"Such, in the briefest possible analysis, is the meaning of the poems"
384,VII,contained in this book.

1413,SONG IN THE DARKNESS,It is the last time that no feet
1414,SONG IN THE DARKNESS,But mine can beat upon the floor;
1415,SONG IN THE DARKNESS,It is the last time that no hands
1416,SONG IN THE DARKNESS,But mine can pound upon my heart;

1418,SONG IN THE DARKNESS,But mine can cry and yet be lost;

1436,I,

1442,I,

1460,I,
1461,I,I am a glittering raindrop
1462,I,Hugged close by the cool rhododendron.

1465,I,

1498,II.,"Pass among them,"
1499,II.,Opening fanlike to fall.
1500,II.,

1506,II.,"Darting their long green flickering fronds up at the sky,"

1514,II.,"In terrace beyond terrace,"

1520,II.,They sprawl about the river to look into it;
1521,II.,Up the hill they come
1522,II.,Gesticulating challenge:

1526,II.,
1527,II.,Enamelled domes

1543,III,When the wind blows
1544,III,"Battling through the forest,"
1545,III,"I hear it distantly,"
1546,III,The crash of a perpetual sea.
1547,III,
1548,III,"When the rain falls,"
1549,III,I watch silver spears slanting downwards
1550,III,"From pale river-pools of sky,"
1551,III,Enclosed in dark fronds.
1552,III,
1553,III,"When the sun shines,"

1557,III,
1558,III,I hug the smooth bark of stately red pillars
1559,III,And with cones carefully scattered
1560,III,I mark the progression of dark dial-shadows
1561,III,Flung diagonally downwards through the afternoon.
1562,III,
1563,III,This turf is not like turf:
1564,III,"It is a smooth dry carpet of velvet,"
1565,III,Embroidered with brown patterns of needles and cones.
1566,III,These trees are not like trees:
1567,III,"They are innumerable feathery pagoda-umbrellas,"
1568,III,"Stiffly ungracious to the wind,"
1569,III,Teetering on red-lacquered stems.
1570,III,
1571,III,"In the evening I listen to the winds' lisping,"
1572,III,"While the conflagrations of the sunset flicker and clash behind me,"
1573,III,Flamboyant crenellations of glory amid the charred ebony boles.
1574,III,
1575,III,In the night the fiery nightingales
1576,III,Shall clash and trill through the silence:
1577,III,Like the voices of mermaids crying
1578,III,From the sea.
1579,III,
1580,III,Long ago has the moon whelmed this uncompleted temple.
1581,III,Stars swim like gold fish far above the black arches.
1582,III,
1583,III,Far let the timid feet of dawn fly to catch me:
1584,III,I will abide in this forest of pines:
1585,III,"For I have unveiled naked beauty,"
1586,III,"And the things that she whispered to me in the darkness,"
1587,III,Are buried deep in my heart.
1588,III,
1589,III,"Now let the black tops of the pine-trees break like a spent wave,"

1633,I,
1634,I,"O golden angelus that sounded prolonging uncertain memories,"

1653,II,
1654,II,"High dreams of my city,"

1704,III,And the golden petals
1705,III,Brush drowsily over my face.
1706,III,
1707,III,White butterfly that flutters across my sea of golden blossom;
1708,III,"Tell me, what are you looking for, lone white butterfly?"
1709,III,
1710,III,I am seeking for a strange lonely white flower;

1714,III,"I am the white blossom, the white dead blossom for you."
1715,III,

1737,IV,
1738,IV,The golden temple
1739,IV,"That kindled like a rose against the sunset,"
1740,IV,"Now is dark and silent,"
1741,IV,One light glimmers from its façade.
1742,IV,
1743,IV,In the inner shrine
1744,IV,One stiff golden curtain
1745,IV,Hangs from floor to roof.
1746,IV,
1747,IV,"Black, impassive, helmeted"

1752,IV,The hollow brazen trumpets
1753,IV,Blare and snore.
1754,IV,"The drums, festooned with skulls,"
1755,IV,Roar.
1756,IV,
1757,IV,"Suddenly with a clash of gongs,"
1758,IV,"And a squeal from ear-splitting bugles,"
1759,IV,The golden veil is rent.
1760,IV,
1761,IV,Cavernous blue darkness!
1762,IV,And within it
1763,IV,"Smiling,"

1774,IV,"Once more the golden curtain,"
1775,IV,And the black shapes vanish.
1776,IV,
1777,IV,Aloft in the hollow temple
1778,IV,"There is a shuffle of feet and a sound of hollow voices,"
1779,IV,Soon lost.
1780,IV,
1781,IV,The village drowses in the darkness:

1784,IV,There is no light on its façade.
1785,IV,

1900,II,

1938,II,
1939,II,"In midnight, in mournful moonlight,"
1940,II,"By paths I could not trace,"
1941,II,"I walked in the white garden,"
1942,II,Each flower had a white face.
1943,II,
1944,II,Their perfume intoxicated me: thus I began my dream.
1945,II,
1946,II,"I was alone; I had no one to guide me,"
1947,II,But the moon was like the sun:
1948,II,"It stooped and kissed each waxen petal,"
1949,II,One after one.
1950,II,
1951,II,"Green and white was that garden: diamond rain hung in the branches,"
1952,II,You will not believe it!
1953,II,
1954,II,"In the morning, at the dayspring,"
1955,II,"I wakened, shivering; lo,"
1956,II,The white garden that blossomed at my feet
1957,II,Was a garden hidden in snow.
1958,II,It was my sorrow to see that all this was a dream.

1967,III,"Sparkling to the horizon,"
1968,III,I see the snow alone.
1969,III,
1970,III,"In the deep blue chasm,"
1971,III,Boats sleep under gold thatch;
1972,III,Icicle-like trees fret
1973,III,Faintly rose-touched sky.
1974,III,
1975,III,"Under their heaped snow-eaves,"
1976,III,Leaden houses shiver.
1977,III,"Through thin blue crevasses,"
1978,III,Trickles an icy stream.
1979,III,
1980,III,"The pines groan white-laden,"
1981,III,"The waves shiver, struck by the wind;"
1982,III,"Beyond from treeless horizons,"
1983,III,Broken snow-peaks crawl to the sea.
1984,III,
1985,III,*       *       *       *       *
1986,III,
1987,III,"Wearily the snow glares,"
1988,III,"Through the grey silence, day after day,"
1989,III,Mocking the colourless cloudless sky
1990,III,With the reflection of death.
1991,III,
1992,III,"There is no smoke through the pine tops,"
1993,III,"No strong red boatmen in pale green reeds,"
1994,III,"No herons to flicker an instant,"
1995,III,No lanterns to glow with gay ray.
1996,III,
1997,III,"No sails beat up to the harbour,"
1998,III,With creaking cordage and sailors' song.
1999,III,"Somnolent, bare-poled, indifferent,"
2000,III,"They sleep, and the city sleeps."
2001,III,
2002,III,"Mid-winter about them casts,"
2003,III,Its dreary fortifications:
2004,III,"Each day is a gaunt grey rock,"
2005,III,And death is the last of them all.

2007,III,*       *       *       *       *
2008,III,
2009,III,"Over the sluggish snow,"
2010,III,Drifts now a pallid weak shower of bloom;
2011,III,"Boredom of fresh creation,"
2012,III,Death-weariness of old returns.
2013,III,
2014,III,"White, white blossom,"
2015,III,Fall of the shattered cups day on day:
2016,III,"Is there anything here that is not ancient,"
2017,III,That has not bloomed a thousand years ago?
2018,III,
2019,III,"Under the glare of the white-hot day,"
2020,III,"Under the restless wind-rakes of the winter,"
2021,III,"White blossom or white snow scattered,"
2022,III,"And beneath them, dark, the graves."
2023,III,
2024,III,"Dark graves never changing,"
2025,III,"White dream drifting, never changing above them:"
2026,III,"O that the white scroll of heaven might be rolled up,"
2027,III,And the naked red lightning thrust at the smouldering
2028,III,earth!

2041,I,
2042,I,There is a tall white weed growing at the top of this sand hill:
2043,I,In the grass
2044,I,It is very still.
2045,I,
2046,I,It lifts its heavy bracts of flattened bloom
2047,I,Against the sky
2048,I,Hazily grey with brume.
2049,I,
2050,I,Out over yonder boats pass
2051,I,And the swallows
2052,I,Flatten themselves on the grass.
2053,I,
2054,I,The lake is silvering beneath the heat.
2055,I,The wind's feet
2056,I,"Touch lazily each crest,"
2057,I,Like white gulls slow flapping
2058,I,To windward.
2059,I,
2060,I,"One rose white cloud slowly disengages, loosening itself,"
2061,I,And stands
2062,I,Above the larkspur-coloured water:
2063,I,Like Dione's daughter

2070,II,
2071,II,"The moon puts out her face at a rift between the trees,"
2072,II,"Which do not lift one drooping leaf, this night of June."
2073,II,There is no lazy breeze to set them clashing adrift.
2074,II,
2075,II,"Thin gleams of silver rise and break in the air,"
2076,II,Fireflies--here and there.
2077,II,
2078,II,"Forest of blue masses suddenly quivering with rapid points of white,"
2079,II,Are the forests beneath the sea where no breeze passes
2080,II,As still as you to-night?
2081,II,
2082,II,The moon puts out her face at a rift between the trees;
2083,II,"Through my window, the bed cut evenly with diagonal shafts of light,"
2084,II,Is a boat rocking out adrift.
2085,II,
2086,II,"Under it bend the silver tips of the dark blue coral trees,"
2087,II,And fireflies like glass fish
2088,II,Drift and ripple upwards in the breeze.

2096,III,To where the clouds are lifting
2097,III,High-fretted towers in the sky:
2098,III,"Palaces of ivory,"
2099,III,Which we look at dreamily.
2100,III,Over our sail
2101,III,"Frail white clouds,"
2102,III,Drift as slowly
2103,III,"Over the undulant pale blue silk of the water,"
2104,III,As we.
2105,III,
2106,III,"We are racing swiftly, you and I,"
2107,III,The sun darts one firm track
2108,III,Through the blue-black
2109,III,Of the crinkled water.
2110,III,"Gold spirals spattering, flashing,"
2111,III,"The water heaves and curls away at our bow,"
2112,III,A mad fish splashing.
2113,III,
2114,III,"We are rocked together, you and I,"
2115,III,To this undulant movement.
2116,III,"White cloud with blue water blent,"
2117,III,"Cloud dipping down to wave its lazy head,"
2118,III,Wave curling under cloud its cloudy blue.
2119,III,"I and you,"
2120,III,"All alone, alone, at last."
2121,III,I hold you fast.

2130,IV,"Ascending and toppling in crumbled ravines, dribbling down chasms"
2131,IV,"of silence,"
2132,IV,"Reassembling in crowded multitudes, massive forms one above another."
2133,IV,"And I saw in their ridges and hollows, the appearance of a woman"
2134,IV,"Immeasurable, carven in stainless marble, motionless, naked, fair:"
2135,IV,"Her head thrown back, her pointed breasts up-gleaming in chill sunlight,"
2136,IV,"Her heavy flanks dark in the shadow, resting forever inert."
2137,IV,"And up to her there suddenly clomb and hurried another cloud,"
2138,IV,"Huge, hairy, bulging, and knobby, with dark and knotted brows:"
2139,IV,"And he thrust out long bungling arms to her and drew himself up to her,"
2140,IV,"And I watched them melting together, blue mouth to sad white mouth."

2152,I,Now that all the world is filled
2153,I,With armies clamouring;
2154,I,"Now that men no longer live and die, one by one,"
2155,I,But in vague indeterminate multitudes:
2156,I,
2157,I,"Now that the trees are coppery towers,"
2158,I,"Now that the clouds loom southward,"
2159,I,Now that the glossy creeper
2160,I,Spatters the walls like spilt wine:
2161,I,
2162,I,"I will go out alone,"
2163,I,To catch strong joy of solitude
2164,I,"Where the treelines, in gold and scarlet,"

2178,II,Where dry bugles blare.
2179,II,
2180,II,Here in this hollow
2181,II,"It is very quiet,"
2182,II,Only the wind's hissing laughter
2183,II,In the place of tombs.
2184,II,
2185,II,One by one these gaunt scarred faces
2186,II,Lift up blurred wrinkled inscriptions
2187,II,Silently beseeching me to stop and ponder.
2188,II,What does it matter if I do not stop to read them?
2189,II,No one at all has gone this way that I have chosen before.
2190,II,
2191,II,A leaf drops slowly in silence;
2192,II,It is a long time twisting and hovering on its way to
2193,II,the earth.
2194,II,
2195,II,"Guns booming,"
2196,II,"Bellowing,"
2197,II,"Crashing,"
2198,II,Desperate.
2199,II,"Insistent outcry of savage guns,"
2200,II,Rocking the gloomy hollow.
2201,II,
2202,II,"I will run out like the wind,"
2203,II,"Snarling, with savage laughter;"
2204,II,"Like the wind that tosses the grey-black clouds,"
2205,II,Against the shot-racked barrier of flaming trees.
2206,II,
2207,II,"I will race between the grey guns,"
2208,II,"And the clouds, like shrapnel exploding,"
2209,II,"Flinging their hail through the tumult,"
2210,II,"Bursting, will melt in cold spray."
2211,II,
2212,II,I am the wanderer of the world;
2213,II,No one can hold me.
2214,II,"Not the cannon assembled for battle,"
2215,II,"Nor the gloomy graves of the hollow,"
2216,II,"Nor the house where I long time slumbered,"
2217,II,Nor the hilltop where roads are straggling.
2218,II,
2219,II,My feet must march to the wind.
2220,II,"Like a leaf dropping slowly,"
2221,II,"An orange butterfly turning and twisting,"
2222,II,I touch with moist passionate palms the leaden inscriptions
2223,II,Of my past. Then I turn to depart.

2232,III,"Now my thoughts gipsying,"
2233,III,Go forth to strange walls and new fires.
2234,III,
2235,III,"Mouths stained with brown-red berries,"
2236,III,"Bronzed cheeks sunken, unshaven,"
2237,III,Ragged attire;
2238,III,We swing our guitars at the hip
2239,III,"As we tramp heedless, uncaring."
2240,III,
2241,III,In the inn the fire crackles:
2242,III,On the hearth the wine is simmering.
2243,III,"Lift up the brown beaker one instant,"
2244,III,Drink deeply--fling out the last coin--let us go.
2245,III,"On the plains there is drooping harvest,"
2246,III,"But no harvest can for long time hold us,"
2247,III,"We have seen the winds, baffled,"
2248,III,Racing up the orange-flecked trench of the hills.

2250,III,
2251,III,
2252,IV,IV
2253,IV,
2254,IV,
2255,IV,On the hill summit
2256,IV,"Where the gusty wind all night long has assailed me,"
2257,IV,Now I see stars vanishing
2258,IV,Before the long cold clutching fingers of dawn.
2259,IV,
2260,IV,"Stars scintillant, fire-hued, metallic,"
2261,IV,Topaz fruit of the deep-blue garden:
2262,IV,"Southward you go, my constellations,"
2263,IV,"And leave me with the white day, alone."
2264,IV,
2265,IV,Over the hilltop
2266,IV,Swish with a scurry of wings
2267,IV,"Millions of pale brown birds,"
2268,IV,"Songless, pulsing southward."
2269,IV,
2270,IV,"Birds who have filled the trees,"
2271,IV,"And who fled long ago at my passing,"
2272,IV,"Now you clatter in heedless tumult,"
2273,IV,Fanning with your hot wings my face.
2274,IV,
2275,IV,Carry this word to the southward;
2276,IV,"Say that I have forgotten them that wait for me,"
2277,IV,"All the loves and the hates need expect me no longer,"
2278,IV,In the autumn at last I am alone.
2279,IV,
2280,IV,Suddenly
2281,IV,"The wind crashes through the tree-tops,"
2282,IV,Stripping away their orange-tiled domes;
2283,IV,"Stark blue skeletons, forbidding"
2284,IV,Gesticulate in my face.
2285,IV,You whom I planted and lavished
2286,IV,With all the wealth and beauty I had to bestow
2287,IV,"Hurry away, vain harvest,"
2288,IV,"The winds' scythes can reap you,"
2289,IV,"Where you lie on the earth, and to death's barns you can go."
2290,IV,
2291,IV,Beyond the hilltop
2292,IV,I have seen only the sky.
2293,IV,"The wind, naked, prodding up black-furred clouds,"
2294,IV,Cossacks of winter.
2295,IV,
2296,IV,"Cry, wind,"
2297,IV,"Shriek to the shivering southland,"
2298,IV,"That I am going into winter,"
2299,IV,That I do not hope to return.
2300,IV,
2301,IV,"Farewell, crowded stars,"
2302,IV,"Farewell, birds, winds, clouds and tree-tops,"
2303,IV,"I, weary of you all, seek my destined joy in the north-land,"
2304,IV,Amid blue ice and the rose-purple night of the pole.

2314,V,"Feathers flickering and claws curled,"
2315,V,Watching to seize the ruined world.
2316,V,
2317,V,"Rolling in a torrent,"
2318,V,"Brown leaves, my achievements,"
2319,V,Rise up from dark-wooded valleys

2321,V,"Brown birds, my wild dreams,"
2322,V,"Mingle their bodies together,"
2323,V,"Shrieking and clamouring as they pass,"
2324,V,Black charred silhouettes
2325,V,"Against the west, curtained in orange flame."
2326,V,Now the wind starts up
2327,V,And strikes the seething water:
2328,V,Hissing in uncoiled fury
2329,V,Each foam-curled wave darts forward
2330,V,To clash and batter
2331,V,"The smouldering iron-rust cliff,"
2332,V,Where the end of my road is lost.
2333,V,
2334,V,"Rise up, black clouds;"
2335,V,Pounce upon the sunset:
2336,V,Tear it with your jagged teeth.
2337,V,"Fling yourselves, seething winds, in circles"
2338,V,"Upon the blue-black water,"
2339,V,"Swirl, leaves, and dance"
2340,V,"Amid the chaos of breakers,"
2341,V,"Flicker, birds, an instant"
2342,V,Against the tawny tiger throat of the sun
2343,V,Which is snarling in the west.
2344,V,"Beat down, O great winds, westward,"
2345,V,"Loose reins and gallop to seaward,"
2346,V,"Rush me, too, to that ocean,"
2347,V,In which I have found my goal.
2348,V,
2349,V,"Lash me, lap me, rugged waves of blue-black water,"
2350,V,"Dash me, clutch me and do not let me rest one instant;"
2351,V,"All through the purple-blue night rock and soothe me,"
2352,V,Till I awaken dreamingly at the faint rose breast of the dawn.

2373,I,
2374,I,"Now my voyage is ending,"

2456,III,
2457,III,Over my head a bell beats: it is midnight.
2458,III,Perhaps I will live to the dawn.
2459,III,
2460,III,About me are the mouths of yawning furnaces
2461,III,"And from these scarlet mouths the heat outpours,"
2462,III,And darts and licks its dry tongues at my brain
2463,III,"Till it, too, seems a black shell almost bursting"
2464,III,With the force of flame in it.
2465,III,
2466,III,"Still, wearily, I swing my shovel,"
2467,III,Spattering the black coal over the palates
2468,III,Of the snoring mouths which rapidly swallow.
2469,III,There is nothing else to do.
2470,III,
2471,III,My legs seem melting away in sweat beneath me:
2472,III,"In my body my lungs and heart are fighting for air,"
2473,III,"My eyes are seared by the appalling scarlet,"
2474,III,Of the furnaces about me--I scarcely-see them--My
2475,III,shovelfuls fall short with every swing.
2476,III,
2477,III,"Without I hear the battering of the tempest,"
2478,III,"The ship is pounded sideways by black immeasurable wave-thrusts,"
2479,III,"And rising dizzily again, like a half-senseless fighter,"
2480,III,"Is again sent downwards, by those unseen fists."
2481,III,
2482,III,"My shovel rises to the ship's slow recovery,"
2483,III,"My shovel shoots out at the smash of toppling masses,"
2484,III,"Sometimes I pause and pant for an endless instant,"
2485,III,"While the ship crouches, quivering."
2486,III,
2487,III,Over my head a bell beats: it is morning.
2488,III,"Wearily I drop the shovel,"
2489,III,And drag myself to the deck.

2493,IV,IV
2494,IV,
2495,IV,
2496,IV,Afar
2497,IV,There is something that seems a shore;
2498,IV,"The sky has been blown clean of clouds except to westward,"
2499,IV,"And these stare hard at me, like huge sardonyx towers."
2500,IV,
2501,IV,"I cling to a half-shattered rail that reels and dances,"
2502,IV,"Soused by the choking water,"
2503,IV,"My face a streaming mass of blood and salt and grime,"
2504,IV,I wait and dizzily I try to remember.
2505,IV,
2506,IV,What is this city that out there awaits me?
2507,IV,Am I its conqueror?
2508,IV,
2509,IV,Will scarlet flags hang fluttering in the streets
2510,IV,To greet my coming?
2511,IV,Will crimson lanterns
2512,IV,Jingle and toss in festival to-night?
2513,IV,
2514,IV,Has the fire burned the ship and is the water
2515,IV,"But stinging icy fire,"
2516,IV,That whips and sears my face?
2517,IV,
2518,IV,"Down there the furnaces go out, for the water"
2519,IV,Sloshes about the floor;
2520,IV,"And steaming acrid fumes arise,"
2521,IV,No living soul could stay in such a place.
2522,IV,
2523,IV,"Out here the decks are shattered,"
2524,IV,"The boats are shorn away,"
2525,IV,"And far on the horizon,"
2526,IV,The city glares with its sardonyx towers.
2527,IV,
2528,IV,"Now the red bells,"
2529,IV,"The black-red bells,"
2530,IV,"The storm bells,"
2531,IV,"Break loose from the horizon,"
2532,IV,"Leaping upon the eastern sea,"
2533,IV,And breaking it in their teeth.
2534,IV,
2535,IV,The towers
2536,IV,"Infuriate, enkindle"
2537,IV,"From base to summit,"
2538,IV,"In layers, and orange terraces,"
2539,IV,Against the blue snow haze that drifts down on them from the east.
2540,IV,
2541,IV,The ship of my soul
2542,IV,"Is rolling to port at last,"
2543,IV,"With one clang from its heaving boilers,"
2544,IV,"One sigh from its shaking funnels,"
2545,IV,One rattle from its loosened chains.
2546,IV,I will lash myself to the masthead
2547,IV,And wait
2548,IV,"Empty-eyed and open-mouthed,"
2549,IV,Till the city that is all one scarlet flame of death
2550,IV,Takes me to itself at last.

2584,I,"Windblown hair and lustful lips,"
2585,I,I am not what you desire.
2586,I,
2587,I,Yesterday
2588,I,One--two--sails above the mist--.
2589,I,Windswallows that hover
2590,I,"Towards the rainclouds of the horizon,"
2591,I,Out of the reedy harbours
2592,I,"Rocking, swaying, falling,"
2593,I,Blown to sea and parted

2602,II,"Purple-blue bloom of night,"

2604,II,Down the dark vineyards of untrodden streets:
2605,II,
2606,II,The noise of the moments is like the clash of the hoofs of a horse
2607,II,"rattling,"
2608,II,Thin tattoo in the stillness:
2609,II,"The noise of the moments takes me, uncaring,"
2610,II,Towards the day.
2611,II,
2612,II,"With brassy crash, dawn's corybants"
2613,II,Invade and trample the vineyard:
2614,II,"Like a faun I hide and watch them,"
2615,II,A dark cup in my hand.
2616,II,
2617,II,"Spoilers of my vineyard,"
2618,II,"Spilling the lees of my sweet red wine,"
2619,II,"You will yet ask in vain for a cup that is not yours,"

2621,II,
2622,II,"Tramplers in the morning,"
2623,II,"Sunburnt faces and weary lips,"
2624,II,"There is yet a cup here you cannot have,"
2625,II,I hold it in my hands.
2626,II,
2627,II,Would you drink of it?
2628,II,Lay down your thyrse and timbrel.
2629,II,"Break the harsh dance that flickers through the morning,"
2630,II,Forget the scarlet perfumes of the day.
2631,II,
2632,II,"Remember only starless night, cool swish of many seas."
2633,II,
2634,II,"Faint pearl-glow of evening,"

2646,III,Hiding its blurred imperfections
2647,III,In endless tenderness.
2648,III,
2649,III,I love the day's
2650,III,"High violet cone of light,"
2651,III,With thin haze on the horizon
2652,III,Like a wavering summer sea.
2653,III,
2654,III,"But most of all I love midsummer dawn,"
2655,III,When far-off planes of light ascend and tremble together
2656,III,"Like distant purple waves, the sound of whose dim breaking"

2667,IV,
2668,IV,I love the night's
2669,IV,Deep purple grapes
2670,IV,That yesterday
2671,IV,"Were crushed and spilled,"
2672,IV,In long and sluggish rivers
2673,IV,"That joined and made a sea,"
2674,IV,"Where, half-guessed through the mist,"
2675,IV,Two golden sails
2676,IV,Drifted on silently.
2677,IV,
2678,IV,The blue fume of my dreams
2679,IV,Is laced with violet flame.
2680,IV,
2681,IV,One golden sail alone came back to rest
2682,IV,In its nest
2683,IV,Among the reeds.
2684,IV,The other sail is lost;
2685,IV,"Behind the mist,"
2686,IV,"Beyond the craggy rock,"
2687,IV,About which race in jagged white
2688,IV,"The waves,"
2689,IV,Horizon on horizon far away
2690,IV,She waits.
2691,IV,"But through the day,"
2692,IV,"Comes no faint song, nor creaking of the ropes."
2693,IV,

2710,I,From grey-blue melting ice-slabs 'neath their arches
2711,I,The spring goes up again.
2712,I,
2713,I,"Writhing, exuding,"
2714,I,"Up-steaming, streaming,"

2716,I,Wet clouds of spring.
2717,I,
2718,I,"Dim rosy fans, the trees"
2719,I,"As they flick to and fro,"

2722,I,
2723,I,The sky remodulates itself
2724,I,"From violet-grey to blue,"
2725,I,Under the upturned eaves of the blue larches

2727,I,
2728,I,Now with the heat of the sun
2729,I,"The grey-blue ice-slabs quiver,"

2731,I,Towards the river.
2732,I,
2733,I,Up on the hillside between the long row of larches

2746,II,To the place whence first they came.
2747,II,
2748,II,One or two orange lamps burnt low
2749,II,Against deep purple hills--
2750,II,
2751,II,"The wind was hurrying, bundling them together,"
2752,II,The pines awoke to sing
2753,II,The song of the snow buzzing and screaming
2754,II,On its one string.
2755,II,
2756,II,I have seen within my heart
2757,II,"Crocuses, purple and gold,"
2758,II,Drop cold and dull and colourless
2759,II,Beneath the snow.
2760,II,
2761,II,"One or two orange lamps burnt low,"
2762,II,Vain memories.
2763,II,
2764,II,"The wind has driven me too many winters,"
2765,II,My songs are snowflakes whirling about my breast.
2766,II,"I will wrap my frozen and bitter songs about me,"
2767,II,"In one grey drift, and rest."

2770,II,
2771,III,III
2772,III,
2773,III,
2774,III,Fluttering and soft the snow
2775,III,"Flings outward, swirls and settles,"
2776,III,"But when I try to seize it,"
2777,III,The wind tears it away.
2778,III,
2779,III,"Through poised green platforms of enormous pines,"
2780,III,I see far hilltops pushing up blue roofs.
2781,III,"Snow comes,"
2782,III,And hums
2783,III,Through the woof
2784,III,Of the lower branches.
2785,III,It skips and dances:
2786,III,It drops in sluggish folds
2787,III,"Of grey,"
2788,III,To where the frozen rhododendron bushes
2789,III,"With lower air-gusts play,"
2790,III,And the earth hushes
2791,III,Its movement.
2792,III,
2793,III,Fluttering and soft the snow is blent
2794,III,In long loose spirals with my dream.
2795,III,
2796,III,"It is all I have, the snow,"
2797,III,And I know
2798,III,"That when I chase it, it will fly from me;"
2799,III,"Beyond the lifeless green,"
2800,III,"Beyond the low blue hills,"
2801,III,"Beyond the pale straw-coloured glare,"
2802,III,Down in the west
2803,III,It goes;
2804,III,Straight southward where the purple-orange flare
2805,III,"Of sunset flows,"
2806,III,And into the blackened heart of my last rose
2807,III,Pours its despair.
2808,III,
2809,III,"Fluttering, soft, and dim"
2810,III,Regrets that skip and skim
2811,III,Grey in the grey twilight;

2823,IV,In which I wrapped my dreams;
2824,IV,They were black screens on which I made those pictures
2825,IV,That faded out next day.
2826,IV,
2827,IV,"Youth without glory, manhood one mad struggle,"
2828,IV,Maturity a battle without trumpet calls:
2829,IV,Long gleams from pallid suns seen only in my dreaming
2830,IV,Struck those dissolving walls.
2831,IV,
2832,IV,"And of my days,"
2833,IV,I only know
2834,IV,"They slipped and fell,"
2835,IV,"Like too-brief sunsets,"
2836,IV,Into the hill-ravines that held the snow.
2837,IV,Three lofty pines
2838,IV,At the corners of my heart
2839,IV,"Waited, apart."
2840,IV,
2841,IV,They only see
2842,IV,In the mystery
2843,IV,"Of the grey sky,"

2868,I,

2892,II,Three men are riding.
2893,II,
2894,II,One of them looks and sees the sky:
2895,II,One of them looks and sees the earth:
2896,II,The last one looks and sees nothing at all.
2897,II,They ride on.
2898,II,
2899,II,"One of them pauses and says, ""It is death."""

2903,II,
2904,II,The sky
2905,II,Is filled with oval violet-tinted clouds
2906,II,"Through which the sun long settled strikes at random,"
2907,II,Enkindling here and there blotched circles of rosy light.
2908,II,
2909,II,"These are poppies,"

2911,II,Waving the horsemen on.
2912,II,
2913,II,"Over the earth, upheaving, folding,"

2917,II,"The last man sees he rides to his death,"

2927,III,"Lift the wrinkled aching furrows of their fields, falling away,"
2928,III,To the rainy sky in vain.
2929,III,
2930,III,But in the furrows
2931,III,There is grass and many flowers.
2932,III,Scarlet tossing poppies
2933,III,"Flutter their wind-slashed edges,"
2934,III,On which gorged black flies poise and sway in drunken sleep.
2935,III,
2936,III,The black flies hang
2937,III,"Above the tangled trampled grasses,"

2952,IV,
2953,IV,"The sky was an even expanse of rolling grey smoke,"
2954,IV,Lit faintly by the moon that hung
2955,IV,Its white face in a dead tree to the east.
2956,IV,
2957,IV,Within the depths of greenish greyish smoke
2958,IV,"Were roars,"
2959,IV,"Crackles and spheres of vapour,"
2960,IV,And then
2961,IV,"Huge disks of crimson shooting up, falling away."
2962,IV,
2963,IV,"And I said these are flower petals,"
2964,IV,"Sleep petals, dream petals,"
2965,IV,Blown by the winds of a dream.
2966,IV,
2967,IV,But still the crimson rockets rose.
2968,IV,They seemed to be
2969,IV,"One great field of immense poppies burning evenly,"
2970,IV,Casting their viscid perfume to the earth.
2971,IV,
2972,IV,"The earth is sown with dead,"
2973,IV,And out of these the red
2974,IV,"Blooms are pushing up, advancing higher,"
2975,IV,"And each night brings them nigher,"

2986,V,
2987,V,But when the evening
2988,V,"Crouches down, like a hurt rabbit,"
2989,V,"Under the everlasting raincloud whirling up the north horizon,"

2998,V,"Out where the sea, sailless,"

3003,V,"That looks like a face half torn away,"
3004,V,"And from its flat mouth barks at the sky,"
3005,V,"The sky which is shot with broad red disks of light,"
3006,V,Petals drowsily falling.

3014,VI,"Nor for faith, nor for new generations,"
3015,VI,That unburied we roll and float
3016,VI,Beneath this flaming tumult of drunken sleep-flowers.

3018,VI,"Something we longed for, poisonous, seductive,"
3019,VI,"That we dared go out in the night together,"

3021,VI,On the unsown fields of death.

3024,VI,Red swaths of a new harvest:
3025,VI,"But you who follow after,"
3026,VI,Must struggle with our dream:
3027,VI,"And out of its restless and oppressive night,"

3030,VI,"Which we hold aloof in silence."""
