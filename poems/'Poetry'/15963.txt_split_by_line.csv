120,MAY-DAY.,MAY-DAY.
121,MAY-DAY.,
122,MAY-DAY.,
123,MAY-DAY.,"Daughter of Heaven and Earth, coy Spring,"
124,MAY-DAY.,"With sudden passion languishing,"
125,MAY-DAY.,"Maketh all things softly smile,"
126,MAY-DAY.,"Painteth pictures mile on mile,"
127,MAY-DAY.,"Holds a cup with cowslip-wreaths,"
128,MAY-DAY.,Whence a smokeless incense breathes.
129,MAY-DAY.,"Girls are peeling the sweet willow,"
130,MAY-DAY.,"Poplar white, and Gilead-tree,"
131,MAY-DAY.,And troops of boys
132,MAY-DAY.,"Shouting with whoop and hilloa,"
133,MAY-DAY.,"And hip, hip three times three."
134,MAY-DAY.,The air is full of whistlings bland;
135,MAY-DAY.,What was that I heard
136,MAY-DAY.,Out of the hazy land?
137,MAY-DAY.,"Harp of the wind, or song of bird,"
138,MAY-DAY.,"Or clapping of shepherd's hands,"
139,MAY-DAY.,"Or vagrant booming of the air,"
140,MAY-DAY.,Voice of a meteor lost in day?
141,MAY-DAY.,Such tidings of the starry sphere
142,MAY-DAY.,Can this elastic air convey.
143,MAY-DAY.,Or haply 't was the cannonade
144,MAY-DAY.,"Of the pent and darkened lake,"
145,MAY-DAY.,"Cooled by the pendent mountain's shade,"
146,MAY-DAY.,"Whose deeps, till beams of noonday break,"
147,MAY-DAY.,"Afflicted moan, and latest hold"
148,MAY-DAY.,Even unto May the iceberg cold.
149,MAY-DAY.,"Was it a squirrel's pettish bark,"
150,MAY-DAY.,"Or clarionet of jay? or hark,"
151,MAY-DAY.,"Where yon wedged line the Nestor leads,"
152,MAY-DAY.,Steering north with raucous cry
153,MAY-DAY.,"Through tracts and provinces of sky,"
154,MAY-DAY.,Every night alighting down
155,MAY-DAY.,"In new landscapes of romance,"
156,MAY-DAY.,Where darkling feed the clamorous clans
157,MAY-DAY.,By lonely lakes to men unknown.
158,MAY-DAY.,"Come the tumult whence it will,"
159,MAY-DAY.,"Voice of sport, or rush of wings,"
160,MAY-DAY.,"It is a sound, it is a token"
161,MAY-DAY.,"That the marble sleep is broken,"
162,MAY-DAY.,And a change has passed on things.
163,MAY-DAY.,
164,MAY-DAY.,"Beneath the calm, within the light,"
165,MAY-DAY.,A hid unruly appetite
166,MAY-DAY.,"Of swifter life, a surer hope,"
167,MAY-DAY.,"Strains every sense to larger scope,"
168,MAY-DAY.,Impatient to anticipate
169,MAY-DAY.,The halting steps of aged Fate.
170,MAY-DAY.,"Slow grows the palm, too slow the pearl:"
171,MAY-DAY.,"When Nature falters, fain would zeal"
172,MAY-DAY.,"Grasp the felloes of her wheel,"
173,MAY-DAY.,And grasping give the orbs another whirl.
174,MAY-DAY.,"Turn swiftlier round, O tardy ball!"
175,MAY-DAY.,"And sun this frozen side,"
176,MAY-DAY.,"Bring hither back the robin's call,"
177,MAY-DAY.,Bring back the tulip's pride.
178,MAY-DAY.,
179,MAY-DAY.,Why chidest thou the tardy Spring?
180,MAY-DAY.,The hardy bunting does not chide;
181,MAY-DAY.,The blackbirds make the maples ring
182,MAY-DAY.,With social cheer and jubilee;
183,MAY-DAY.,"The redwing flutes his _o-ka-lee_,"
184,MAY-DAY.,The robins know the melting snow;
185,MAY-DAY.,"The sparrow meek, prophetic-eyed,"
186,MAY-DAY.,"Her nest beside the snow-drift weaves,"
187,MAY-DAY.,Secure the osier yet will hide
188,MAY-DAY.,Her callow brood in mantling leaves;
189,MAY-DAY.,"And thou, by science all undone,"
190,MAY-DAY.,Why only must thy reason fail
191,MAY-DAY.,To see the southing of the sun?
192,MAY-DAY.,
193,MAY-DAY.,"As we thaw frozen flesh with snow,"
194,MAY-DAY.,"So Spring will not, foolish fond,"
195,MAY-DAY.,"Mix polar night with tropic glow,"
196,MAY-DAY.,"Nor cloy us with unshaded sun,"
197,MAY-DAY.,"Nor wanton skip with bacchic dance,"
198,MAY-DAY.,But she has the temperance
199,MAY-DAY.,"Of the gods, whereof she is one,--"
200,MAY-DAY.,Masks her treasury of heat
201,MAY-DAY.,Under east-winds crossed with sleet.
202,MAY-DAY.,Plants and birds and humble creatures
203,MAY-DAY.,Well accept her rule austere;
204,MAY-DAY.,"Titan-born, to hardy natures"
205,MAY-DAY.,Cold is genial and dear.
206,MAY-DAY.,As Southern wrath to Northern right
207,MAY-DAY.,Is but straw to anthracite;
208,MAY-DAY.,"As in the day of sacrifice,"
209,MAY-DAY.,"When heroes piled the pyre,"
210,MAY-DAY.,The dismal Massachusetts ice
211,MAY-DAY.,"Burned more than others' fire,"
212,MAY-DAY.,So Spring guards with surface cold
213,MAY-DAY.,The garnered heat of ages old:
214,MAY-DAY.,"Hers to sow the seed of bread,"
215,MAY-DAY.,That man and all the kinds be fed;
216,MAY-DAY.,"And, when the sunlight fills the hours,"
217,MAY-DAY.,"Dissolves the crust, displays the flowers."
218,MAY-DAY.,
219,MAY-DAY.,"The world rolls round,--mistrust it not,--"
220,MAY-DAY.,Befalls again what once befell;
221,MAY-DAY.,"All things return, both sphere and mote,"
222,MAY-DAY.,"And I shall hear my bluebird's note,"
223,MAY-DAY.,And dream the dream of Auburn dell.
224,MAY-DAY.,
225,MAY-DAY.,"When late I walked, in earlier days,"
226,MAY-DAY.,All was stiff and stark;
227,MAY-DAY.,"Knee-deep snows choked all the ways,"
228,MAY-DAY.,In the sky no spark;
229,MAY-DAY.,"Firm-braced I sought my ancient woods,"
230,MAY-DAY.,Struggling through the drifted roads;
231,MAY-DAY.,"The whited desert knew me not,"
232,MAY-DAY.,Snow-ridges masked each darling spot;
233,MAY-DAY.,"The summer dells, by genius haunted,"
234,MAY-DAY.,One arctic moon had disenchanted.
235,MAY-DAY.,All the sweet secrets therein hid
236,MAY-DAY.,"By Fancy, ghastly spells undid."
237,MAY-DAY.,"Eldest mason, Frost, had piled,"
238,MAY-DAY.,"With wicked ingenuity,"
239,MAY-DAY.,Swift cathedrals in the wild;
240,MAY-DAY.,The piny hosts were sheeted ghosts
241,MAY-DAY.,In the star-lit minster aisled.
242,MAY-DAY.,I found no joy: the icy wind
243,MAY-DAY.,Might rule the forest to his mind.
244,MAY-DAY.,Who would freeze in frozen brakes?
245,MAY-DAY.,"Back to books and sheltered home,"
246,MAY-DAY.,"And wood-fire flickering on the walls,"
247,MAY-DAY.,"To hear, when, 'mid our talk and games,"
248,MAY-DAY.,Without the baffled north-wind calls.
249,MAY-DAY.,But soft! a sultry morning breaks;
250,MAY-DAY.,The cowslips make the brown brook gay;
251,MAY-DAY.,"A happier hour, a longer day."
252,MAY-DAY.,"Now the sun leads in the May,"
253,MAY-DAY.,"Now desire of action wakes,"
254,MAY-DAY.,And the wish to roam.
255,MAY-DAY.,
256,MAY-DAY.,The caged linnet in the Spring
257,MAY-DAY.,"Hearkens for the choral glee,"
258,MAY-DAY.,When his fellows on the wing
259,MAY-DAY.,Migrate from the Southern Sea;
260,MAY-DAY.,"When trellised grapes their flowers unmask,"
261,MAY-DAY.,"And the new-born tendrils twine,"
262,MAY-DAY.,The old wine darkling in the cask
263,MAY-DAY.,"Feels the bloom on the living vine,"
264,MAY-DAY.,And bursts the hoops at hint of Spring:
265,MAY-DAY.,"And so, perchance, in Adam's race,"
266,MAY-DAY.,Of Eden's bower some dream-like trace
267,MAY-DAY.,"Survived the Flight, and swam the Flood,"
268,MAY-DAY.,And wakes the wish in youngest blood
269,MAY-DAY.,"To tread the forfeit Paradise,"
270,MAY-DAY.,And feed once more the exile's eyes;
271,MAY-DAY.,And ever when the happy child
272,MAY-DAY.,"In May beholds the blooming wild,"
273,MAY-DAY.,"And hears in heaven the bluebird sing,"
274,MAY-DAY.,"""Onward,"" he cries, ""your baskets bring,--"
275,MAY-DAY.,"In the next field is air more mild,"
276,MAY-DAY.,"And o'er yon hazy crest is Eden's balmier Spring."""
277,MAY-DAY.,
278,MAY-DAY.,"Not for a regiment's parade,"
279,MAY-DAY.,"Nor evil laws or rulers made,"
280,MAY-DAY.,"Blue Walden rolls its cannonade,"
281,MAY-DAY.,But for a lofty sign
282,MAY-DAY.,"Which the Zodiac threw,"
283,MAY-DAY.,"That the bondage-days are told,"
284,MAY-DAY.,And waters free as winds shall flow.
285,MAY-DAY.,Lo! how all the tribes combine
286,MAY-DAY.,To rout the flying foe.
287,MAY-DAY.,"See, every patriot oak-leaf throws"
288,MAY-DAY.,"His elfin length upon the snows,"
289,MAY-DAY.,"Not idle, since the leaf all day"
290,MAY-DAY.,"Draws to the spot the solar ray,"
291,MAY-DAY.,"Ere sunset quarrying inches down,"
292,MAY-DAY.,And half-way to the mosses brown;
293,MAY-DAY.,While the grass beneath the rime
294,MAY-DAY.,"Has hints of the propitious time,"
295,MAY-DAY.,And upward pries and perforates
296,MAY-DAY.,"Through the cold slab a thousand gates,"
297,MAY-DAY.,Till green lances peering through
298,MAY-DAY.,Bend happy in the welkin blue.
299,MAY-DAY.,
300,MAY-DAY.,April cold with dropping rain
301,MAY-DAY.,"Willows and lilacs brings again,"
302,MAY-DAY.,"The whistle of returning birds,"
303,MAY-DAY.,And trumpet-lowing of the herds.
304,MAY-DAY.,The scarlet maple-keys betray
305,MAY-DAY.,What potent blood hath modest May;
306,MAY-DAY.,"What fiery force the earth renews,"
307,MAY-DAY.,"The wealth of forms, the flush of hues;"
308,MAY-DAY.,Joy shed in rosy waves abroad
309,MAY-DAY.,"Flows from the heart of Love, the Lord."
310,MAY-DAY.,
311,MAY-DAY.,Hither rolls the storm of heat;
312,MAY-DAY.,I feel its finer billows beat
313,MAY-DAY.,Like a sea which me infolds;
314,MAY-DAY.,"Heat with viewless fingers moulds,"
315,MAY-DAY.,"Swells, and mellows, and matures,"
316,MAY-DAY.,"Paints, and flavours, and allures,"
317,MAY-DAY.,"Bird and brier inly warms,"
318,MAY-DAY.,"Still enriches and transforms,"
319,MAY-DAY.,"Gives the reed and lily length,"
320,MAY-DAY.,"Adds to oak and oxen strength,"
321,MAY-DAY.,"Boils the world in tepid lakes,"
322,MAY-DAY.,"Burns the world, yet burnt remakes;"
323,MAY-DAY.,"Enveloping heat, enchanted robe,"
324,MAY-DAY.,"Wraps the daisy and the globe,"
325,MAY-DAY.,"Transforming what it doth infold,"
326,MAY-DAY.,"Life out of death, new out of old,"
327,MAY-DAY.,"Painting fawns' and leopards' fells,"
328,MAY-DAY.,"Seethes the gulf-encrimsoning shells,"
329,MAY-DAY.,Fires garden with a joyful blaze
330,MAY-DAY.,Of tulips in the morning's rays.
331,MAY-DAY.,"The dead log touched bursts into leaf,"
332,MAY-DAY.,The wheat-blade whispers of the sheaf.
333,MAY-DAY.,"What god is this imperial Heat,"
334,MAY-DAY.,"Earth's prime secret, sculpture's seat?"
335,MAY-DAY.,Doth it bear hidden in its heart
336,MAY-DAY.,"Water-line patterns of all art,"
337,MAY-DAY.,"All figures, organs, hues, and graces?"
338,MAY-DAY.,Is it Daedalus? is it Love?
339,MAY-DAY.,"Or walks in mask almighty Jove,"
340,MAY-DAY.,And drops from Power's redundant horn
341,MAY-DAY.,All seeds of beauty to be born?
342,MAY-DAY.,
343,MAY-DAY.,"Where shall we keep the holiday,"
344,MAY-DAY.,And duly greet the entering May?
345,MAY-DAY.,"Too strait and low our cottage doors,"
346,MAY-DAY.,And all unmeet our carpet floors;
347,MAY-DAY.,"Nor spacious court, nor monarch's hall,"
348,MAY-DAY.,Suffice to hold the festival.
349,MAY-DAY.,Up and away! where haughty woods
350,MAY-DAY.,Front the liberated floods:
351,MAY-DAY.,"We will climb the broad-backed hills,"
352,MAY-DAY.,Hear the uproar of their joy;
353,MAY-DAY.,We will mark the leaps and gleams
354,MAY-DAY.,"Of the new-delivered streams,"
355,MAY-DAY.,And the murmuring rivers of sap
356,MAY-DAY.,"Mount in the pipes of the trees,"
357,MAY-DAY.,"Giddy with day, to the topmost spire,"
358,MAY-DAY.,Which for a spike of tender green
359,MAY-DAY.,Bartered its powdery cap;
360,MAY-DAY.,"And the colours of joy in the bird,"
361,MAY-DAY.,"And the love in its carol heard,"
362,MAY-DAY.,"Frog and lizard in holiday coats,"
363,MAY-DAY.,And turtle brave in his golden spots;
364,MAY-DAY.,We will hear the tiny roar
365,MAY-DAY.,"Of the insects evermore,"
366,MAY-DAY.,While cheerful cries of crag and plain
367,MAY-DAY.,Reply to the thunder of river and main.
368,MAY-DAY.,
369,MAY-DAY.,As poured the flood of the ancient sea
370,MAY-DAY.,"Spilling over mountain chains,"
371,MAY-DAY.,"Bending forests as bends the sedge,"
372,MAY-DAY.,"Faster flowing o'er the plains,--"
373,MAY-DAY.,A world-wide wave with a foaming edge
374,MAY-DAY.,"That rims the running silver sheet,--"
375,MAY-DAY.,So pours the deluge of the heat
376,MAY-DAY.,"Broad northward o'er the land,"
377,MAY-DAY.,"Painting artless paradises,"
378,MAY-DAY.,"Drugging herbs with Syrian spices,"
379,MAY-DAY.,Fanning secret fires which glow
380,MAY-DAY.,"In columbine and clover-blow,"
381,MAY-DAY.,"Climbing the northern zones,"
382,MAY-DAY.,Where a thousand pallid towns
383,MAY-DAY.,"Lie like cockles by the main,"
384,MAY-DAY.,Or tented armies on a plain.
385,MAY-DAY.,The million-handed sculptor moulds
386,MAY-DAY.,"Quaintest bud and blossom folds,"
387,MAY-DAY.,The million-handed painter pours
388,MAY-DAY.,Opal hues and purple dye;
389,MAY-DAY.,"Azaleas flush the island floors,"
390,MAY-DAY.,And the tints of heaven reply.
391,MAY-DAY.,
392,MAY-DAY.,Wreaths for the May! for happy Spring
393,MAY-DAY.,"To-day shall all her dowry bring,"
394,MAY-DAY.,"The love of kind, the joy, the grace,"
395,MAY-DAY.,"Hymen of element and race,"
396,MAY-DAY.,Knowing well to celebrate
397,MAY-DAY.,"With song and hue and star and state,"
398,MAY-DAY.,"With tender light and youthful cheer,"
399,MAY-DAY.,The spousals of the new-born year.
400,MAY-DAY.,Lo Love's inundation poured
401,MAY-DAY.,Over space and race abroad!
402,MAY-DAY.,
403,MAY-DAY.,"Spring is strong and virtuous,"
404,MAY-DAY.,"Broad-sowing, cheerful, plenteous,"
405,MAY-DAY.,Quickening underneath the mould
406,MAY-DAY.,Grains beyond the price of gold.
407,MAY-DAY.,"So deep and large her bounties are,"
408,MAY-DAY.,"That one broad, long midsummer day"
409,MAY-DAY.,Shall to the planet overpay
410,MAY-DAY.,The ravage of a year of war.
411,MAY-DAY.,
412,MAY-DAY.,"Drug the cup, thou butler sweet,"
413,MAY-DAY.,And send the nectar round;
414,MAY-DAY.,The feet that slid so long on sleet
415,MAY-DAY.,Are glad to feel the ground.
416,MAY-DAY.,Fill and saturate each kind
417,MAY-DAY.,"With good according to its mind,"
418,MAY-DAY.,Fill each kind and saturate
419,MAY-DAY.,"With good agreeing with its fate,"
420,MAY-DAY.,"Willow and violet, maiden and man."
421,MAY-DAY.,
422,MAY-DAY.,"The bitter-sweet, the haunting air,"
423,MAY-DAY.,"Creepeth, bloweth everywhere;"
424,MAY-DAY.,"It preys on all, all prey on it,"
425,MAY-DAY.,"Blooms in beauty, thinks in wit,"
426,MAY-DAY.,"Stings the strong with enterprise,"
427,MAY-DAY.,"Makes travellers long for Indian skies,"
428,MAY-DAY.,And where it comes this courier fleet
429,MAY-DAY.,"Fans in all hearts expectance sweet,"
430,MAY-DAY.,As if to-morrow should redeem
431,MAY-DAY.,The vanished rose of evening's dream.
432,MAY-DAY.,"By houses lies a fresher green,"
433,MAY-DAY.,"On men and maids a ruddier mien,"
434,MAY-DAY.,As if time brought a new relay
435,MAY-DAY.,"Of shining virgins every May,"
436,MAY-DAY.,And Summer came to ripen maids
437,MAY-DAY.,To a beauty that not fades.
438,MAY-DAY.,
439,MAY-DAY.,"The ground-pines wash their rusty green,"
440,MAY-DAY.,"The maple-tops their crimson tint,"
441,MAY-DAY.,"On the soft path each track is seen,"
442,MAY-DAY.,The girl's foot leaves its neater print.
443,MAY-DAY.,The pebble loosened from the frost
444,MAY-DAY.,Asks of the urchin to be tost.
445,MAY-DAY.,"In flint and marble beats a heart,"
446,MAY-DAY.,"The kind Earth takes her children's part,"
447,MAY-DAY.,"The green lane is the school-boy's friend,"
448,MAY-DAY.,"Low leaves his quarrel apprehend,"
449,MAY-DAY.,"The fresh ground loves his top and ball,"
450,MAY-DAY.,"The air rings jocund to his call,"
451,MAY-DAY.,"The brimming brook invites a leap,"
452,MAY-DAY.,"He dives the hollow, climbs the steep."
453,MAY-DAY.,"The youth reads omens where he goes,"
454,MAY-DAY.,And speaks all languages the rose.
455,MAY-DAY.,The wood-fly mocks with tiny noise
456,MAY-DAY.,The far halloo of human voice;
457,MAY-DAY.,The perfumed berry on the spray
458,MAY-DAY.,Smacks of faint memories far away.
459,MAY-DAY.,A subtle chain of countless rings
460,MAY-DAY.,"The next unto the farthest brings,"
461,MAY-DAY.,"And, striving to be man, the worm"
462,MAY-DAY.,Mounts through all the spires of form.
463,MAY-DAY.,
464,MAY-DAY.,"I saw the bud-crowned Spring go forth,"
465,MAY-DAY.,Stepping daily onward north
466,MAY-DAY.,To greet staid ancient cavaliers
467,MAY-DAY.,Filing single in stately train.
468,MAY-DAY.,"And who, and who are the travellers?"
469,MAY-DAY.,"They were Night and Day, and Day and Night,"
470,MAY-DAY.,Pilgrims wight with step forthright.
471,MAY-DAY.,"I saw the Days deformed and low,"
472,MAY-DAY.,Short and bent by cold and snow;
473,MAY-DAY.,"The merry Spring threw wreaths on them,"
474,MAY-DAY.,Flower-wreaths gay with bud and bell;
475,MAY-DAY.,"Many a flower and many a gem,"
476,MAY-DAY.,"They were refreshed by the smell,"
477,MAY-DAY.,"They shook the snow from hats and shoon,"
478,MAY-DAY.,They put their April raiment on;
479,MAY-DAY.,"And those eternal forms,"
480,MAY-DAY.,"Unhurt by a thousand storms,"
481,MAY-DAY.,"Shot up to the height of the sky again,"
482,MAY-DAY.,And danced as merrily as young men.
483,MAY-DAY.,I saw them mask their awful glance
484,MAY-DAY.,Sidewise meek in gossamer lids;
485,MAY-DAY.,And to speak my thought if none forbids.
486,MAY-DAY.,"It was as if the eternal gods,"
487,MAY-DAY.,"Tired of their starry periods,"
488,MAY-DAY.,Hid their majesty in cloth

544,MAY-DAY.,"Piping, as they flew, a march,--"
545,MAY-DAY.,Belike the one they used in parting
546,MAY-DAY.,Last year from yon oak or larch;
547,MAY-DAY.,"Dusky sparrows in a crowd,"
548,MAY-DAY.,"Diving, darting northward free,"
549,MAY-DAY.,"Suddenly betook them all,"
550,MAY-DAY.,"Every one to his hole in the wall,"

574,MAY-DAY.,As with diamond dews thereon.
575,MAY-DAY.,"What cared we for costly joys,"
576,MAY-DAY.,The Museum's far-fetched toys?
577,MAY-DAY.,Gleam of sunshine on the wall
578,MAY-DAY.,Poured a deeper cheer than all
579,MAY-DAY.,The revels of the Carnival.
580,MAY-DAY.,We a pine-grove did prefer
581,MAY-DAY.,"To a marble theatre,"

583,MAY-DAY.,Nor cared for spices or for wine.
584,MAY-DAY.,"Wreaths of mist and rainbow spanned,"

597,MAY-DAY.,"But the ploughman's thoughtless cry,"
598,MAY-DAY.,"Lowing oxen, sheep that bleat,"
599,MAY-DAY.,"And the joiner's hammer-beat,"
600,MAY-DAY.,Softened are above their will.
601,MAY-DAY.,"All grating discords melt,"
602,MAY-DAY.,"No dissonant note is dealt,"
603,MAY-DAY.,And though thy voice be shrill

606,MAY-DAY.,"Echo waits with art and care,"
607,MAY-DAY.,And will the faults of song repair.
608,MAY-DAY.,
609,MAY-DAY.,"So by remote Superior Lake,"

751,MAY-DAY.,Wherein was dropped the mortal spoil.
752,MAY-DAY.,
753,MAY-DAY.,Soft on the south-wind sleeps the haze!
754,MAY-DAY.,So on thy broad mystic van
755,MAY-DAY.,"Lie the opal-coloured days,"
