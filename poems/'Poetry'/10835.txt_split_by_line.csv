29,ADVERTISEMENT.,
30,ADVERTISEMENT.,"It may be asserted, without a partial panegyric of the object of our"
31,ADVERTISEMENT.,"praise, that the works of no single author in the wide range of British"
32,ADVERTISEMENT.,"literature, not excepting, perhaps, even Addison, contain a richer and"
33,ADVERTISEMENT.,more varied fund of rational entertainment and sound instruction than
34,ADVERTISEMENT.,"those of Dr. Johnson. A correct edition of his works must, therefore, be"
35,ADVERTISEMENT.,an acceptable contribution to the mass of national literature. That the
36,ADVERTISEMENT.,"present edition has, perhaps, fairer claims on public approbation than"
37,ADVERTISEMENT.,"most preceding ones, we feel ourselves justified in asserting, without"
38,ADVERTISEMENT.,envious detraction of those who have gone before us. It has been our
39,ADVERTISEMENT.,"wish and diligent endeavour to give as accurate a text as possible, to"
40,ADVERTISEMENT.,"which we have subjoined notes, where elucidation seemed to be required."
41,ADVERTISEMENT.,"They have been collected with care, and will prove our impartiality by"
42,ADVERTISEMENT.,their occasional censures of the faults and failings of the writer whose
43,ADVERTISEMENT.,"works it is our office to illustrate, and our more common and more"
44,ADVERTISEMENT.,"grateful task to praise. Though, being diffused over a wide space, they"
45,ADVERTISEMENT.,"appear less numerous than they really are, it has been our incessant"
46,ADVERTISEMENT.,"care to abstain from that method of redundant annotation, which tends to"
47,ADVERTISEMENT.,"display the ingenuity or mental resources of an editor, much more than"
48,ADVERTISEMENT.,to illustrate the original writer. Notes have been chiefly introduced
49,ADVERTISEMENT.,"for the purpose of guarding our readers against some political sophisms,"
50,ADVERTISEMENT.,"or to correct some hasty error. But happily, in the writings to which we"
51,ADVERTISEMENT.,"have devoted our time and attention, the chaff and dross lie so open to"
52,ADVERTISEMENT.,"view, and are so easily separated from purer matter, that a hint is"
53,ADVERTISEMENT.,"sufficient to protect the most incautious from harm. Accordingly, in our"
54,ADVERTISEMENT.,notes and prefaces we have confined ourselves to simple and succinct
55,ADVERTISEMENT.,"histories of the respective works under consideration, and have avoided,"
56,ADVERTISEMENT.,"as much as might be, a burdensome repetition of criticisms or anecdotes,"
57,ADVERTISEMENT.,"in almost every person's possession, or an idle pointing out of beauties"
58,ADVERTISEMENT.,which none could fail to recognise. The length of time that has elapsed
59,ADVERTISEMENT.,"since the writings of Johnson were first published, has amply developed"
60,ADVERTISEMENT.,"their intrinsic merits, and destroyed the personal and party prejudices"
61,ADVERTISEMENT.,which assail a living author: but the years have been too few to render
62,ADVERTISEMENT.,the customs and manners alluded to so obsolete as to require much
63,ADVERTISEMENT.,"illustrative research.[a] It may be satisfactory to subjoin, that care"
64,ADVERTISEMENT.,"has been exercised in every thing that we have advanced, and that when"
65,ADVERTISEMENT.,"we have erred, it has been on the side of caution."
66,ADVERTISEMENT.,
67,ADVERTISEMENT.,"All the usually received works of Dr. Johnson, together with Murphy's"
68,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Essay on his Life and Genius, are comprised in this edition. In"
69,ADVERTISEMENT.,"pursuance of our plan of brevity, we shall not here give a list of his"
70,ADVERTISEMENT.,"minor and unacknowledged productions, but refer our readers to Boswell;"
71,ADVERTISEMENT.,"a new, amended, and enlarged edition of whose interesting and"
72,ADVERTISEMENT.,"picturesque Memoirs we purpose speedily to present to the public, after"
73,ADVERTISEMENT.,the style and manner of the present work.
74,ADVERTISEMENT.,
75,ADVERTISEMENT.,"One very important addition, however, we conceive that we have made, in"
76,ADVERTISEMENT.,publishing the whole of his sermons. It has been hitherto the practice
77,ADVERTISEMENT.,"to give one or two, with a cursory notice, that Johnson's theological"
78,ADVERTISEMENT.,"knowledge was scanty, or unworthy of his general fame. We have acted"
79,ADVERTISEMENT.,"under a very different impression; for though Johnson was not, nor"
80,ADVERTISEMENT.,"pretended to be, a polemical or controversial divine, he well knew how"
81,ADVERTISEMENT.,to apply to the right regulation of our moral conduct the lessons of
82,ADVERTISEMENT.,"that Christianity which was not promulged for a sect, but for mankind;"
83,ADVERTISEMENT.,"which sought not a distinctive garb in the philosopher's grove, nor"
84,ADVERTISEMENT.,"secluded itself in the hermit's cell, but entered without reserve every"
85,ADVERTISEMENT.,"walk of life, and sympathized with all the instinctive feelings of our"
86,ADVERTISEMENT.,"common nature. This high privilege of our religion Johnson felt, and to"
87,ADVERTISEMENT.,"the diffusion of its practical, not of its theoretical advantages, he"
88,ADVERTISEMENT.,"applied the energies of his heart and mind; and with what success, we"
89,ADVERTISEMENT.,leave to every candid reader to pronounce.
90,ADVERTISEMENT.,
91,ADVERTISEMENT.,"In conclusion, we would express a hope that we shall not inaptly"
92,ADVERTISEMENT.,commence a series of OXFORD ENGLISH CLASSICS with the works of one whose
93,ADVERTISEMENT.,"writings have so enlarged and embellished the science of moral evidence,"
94,ADVERTISEMENT.,which has long constituted a characteristic feature in the literary
95,ADVERTISEMENT.,"discipline of this university. The science of mind and its progress, as"
96,ADVERTISEMENT.,"recorded by history, or unfolded by biography, was Johnson's favourite"
97,ADVERTISEMENT.,"study, and is still the main object of pursuit in the place whose system"
98,ADVERTISEMENT.,"and institutions he so warmly praised, and to which he ever professed"
99,ADVERTISEMENT.,himself so deeply indebted. If the terseness of attic simplicity has
100,ADVERTISEMENT.,"been desiderated by some in the pages of Johnson, they undeniably"
101,ADVERTISEMENT.,"display the depth of thought, the weight of argument, the insight into"
102,ADVERTISEMENT.,"mind and morals, which are to be found in their native dignity only in"
103,ADVERTISEMENT.,the compositions of those older writers with whose spirit he was so
104,ADVERTISEMENT.,"richly imbued. In this place, then, where those models which Johnson"
105,ADVERTISEMENT.,admired and imitated are still upheld as the only sure guides to sound
106,ADVERTISEMENT.,"learning, his writings can never be laid aside unread and neglected."

270,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D."
271,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
272,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","When the works of a great writer, who has bequeathed to posterity a"
273,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","lasting legacy, are presented to the world, it is naturally expected"
274,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",that some account of his life should accompany the edition. The reader
275,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",wishes to know as much as possible of the author. The circumstances that
276,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","attended him, the features of his private character, his conversation,"
277,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","and the means by which he arose to eminence, become the favourite"
278,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",objects of inquiry. Curiosity is excited; and the admirer of his works
279,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","is eager to know his private opinions, his course of study, the"
280,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","particularities of his conduct, and, above all, whether he pursued the"
281,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","wisdom which he recommends, and practised the virtue which his writings"
282,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",inspire. A principle of gratitude is awakened in every generous mind.
283,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",For the entertainment and instruction which genius and diligence have
284,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","provided for the world, men of refined and sensible tempers are ready to"
285,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","pay their tribute of praise, and even to form a posthumous friendship"
286,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",with the author.
287,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
288,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","In reviewing the life of such a writer, there is, besides, a rule of"
289,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",justice to which the public have an undoubted claim. Fond admiration and
290,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",partial friendship should not be suffered to represent his virtues with
291,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","exaggeration; nor should malignity be allowed, under a specious"
292,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","disguise, to magnify mere defects, the usual failings of human nature,"
293,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",into vice or gross deformity. The lights and shades of the character
294,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","should be given; and if this be done with a strict regard to truth, a"
295,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","just estimate of Dr. Johnson will afford a lesson, perhaps, as valuable"
296,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",as the moral doctrine that speaks with energy in every page of his
297,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",works.
298,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
299,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",The present writer enjoyed the conversation and friendship of that
300,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",excellent man more than thirty years. He thought it an honour to be so
301,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","connected, and to this hour he reflects on his loss with regret; but"
302,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","regret, he knows, has secret bribes, by which the judgment may be"
303,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","influenced, and partial affection may be carried beyond the bounds of"
304,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","truth. In the present case, however, nothing needs to be disguised, and"
305,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",exaggerated praise is unnecessary. It is an observation of the younger
306,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Pliny, in his epistle to his friend Tacitus, that history ought never to"
307,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","magnify matters of fact, because worthy actions require nothing but the"
308,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","truth: ""nam nec historia debet egredi veritatem, et honeste factis"
309,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","veritas sufficit."" This rule, the present biographer promises, shall"
310,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",guide his pen throughout the following narrative.
311,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
312,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","It may be said, the death of Dr. Johnson kept the public mind in"
313,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",agitation beyond all former example. No literary character ever excited
314,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","so much attention; and, when the press has teemed with anecdotes,"
315,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","apophthegms, essays, and publications of every kind, what occasion now"
316,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",for a new tract on the same thread-bare subject? The plain truth shall
317,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","be the answer. The proprietors of Johnson's works thought the life,"
318,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","which they prefixed to their former edition, too unwieldy for"
319,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","republication. The prodigious variety of foreign matter, introduced into"
320,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","that performance, seemed to overload the memory of Dr. Johnson, and, in"
321,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the account of his own life, to leave him hardly visible. They wished to"
322,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","have a more concise, and, for that reason, perhaps, a more satisfactory"
323,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","account, such as may exhibit a just picture of the man, and keep him the"
324,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",principal figure in the foreground of his own picture. To comply with
325,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","that request is the design of this essay, which the writer undertakes"
326,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","with a trembling hand. He has no discoveries, no secret anecdotes, no"
327,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","occasional controversy, no sudden flashes of wit and humour, no private"
328,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","conversation, and no new facts, to embellish his work. Every thing has"
329,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","been gleaned. Dr. Johnson said of himself, ""I am not uncandid, nor"
330,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","severe: I sometimes say more than I mean, in jest, and people are apt to"
331,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","think me serious[a]."" The exercise of that privilege, which is enjoyed"
332,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","by every man in society, has not been allowed to him. His fame has given"
333,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",importance even to trifles; and the zeal of his friends has brought
334,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","every thing to light. What should be related, and what should not, has"
335,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","been published without distinction: ""dicenda tacenda locuti!"" Every"
336,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","thing that fell from him has been caught with eagerness by his admirers,"
337,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","who, as he says in one of his letters, have acted with the diligence of"
338,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","spies upon his conduct. To some of them the following lines, in Mallet's"
339,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","poem on verbal criticism, are not inapplicable:"
340,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
341,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","""Such that grave bird in northern seas is found."
342,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",Whose name a Dutchman only knows to sound;
343,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Where'er the king of fish moves on before,"
344,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",This humble friend attends from shore to shore;
345,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","With eye still earnest, and with bill inclined,"
346,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","He picks up what his patron drops behind,"
347,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","With those choice cates his palate to regale,"
348,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","And is the careful Tibbald of a whale."""
349,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
350,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","After so many essays and volumes of Johnsoniana, what remains for the"
351,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","present writer? Perhaps, what has not been attempted; a short, yet full,"
352,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","a faithful, yet temperate, history of Dr. Johnson."
353,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
354,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","SAMUEL JOHNSON was born at Lichfield, September 7, 1709, O. S[b]. His"
355,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","father, Michael Johnson, was a bookseller in that city; a man of large,"
356,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","athletic make, and violent passions; wrong-headed, positive, and, at"
357,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","times, afflicted with a degree of melancholy, little short of madness."
358,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","His mother was sister to Dr. Ford, a practising physician, and father of"
359,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Cornelius Ford, generally known by the name of parson Ford, the same who"
360,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",is represented near the punch-bowl in Hogarth's Midnight Modern
361,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Conversation. In the life of Fenton, Johnson says, that ""his abilities,"
362,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",instead of furnishing convivial merriment to the voluptuous and
363,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","dissolute, might have enabled him to excel among the virtuous and the"
364,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","wise."" Being chaplain to the earl of Chesterfield, he wished to attend"
365,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",that nobleman on his embassy to the Hague. Colley Cibber has recorded
366,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the anecdote. ""You should go,"" said the witty peer, ""if to your many"
367,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","vices you would add one more."" ""Pray, my lord, what is that?"""
368,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","""Hypocrisy, my dear doctor."" Johnson had a younger brother named"
369,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Nathaniel, who died at the age of twenty-seven or twenty-eight. Michael"
370,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Johnson, the father, was chosen, in the year 1718, under bailiff of"
371,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Lichfield; and, in the year 1725, he served the office of the senior"
372,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","bailiff. He had a brother of the name of Andrew, who, for some years,"
373,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","kept the ring at Smithfield, appropriated to wrestlers and boxers. Our"
374,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","author used to say, that he was never thrown or conquered. Michael, the"
375,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","father, died December 1731, at the age of seventy-six: his mother at"
376,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","eighty-nine, of a gradual decay, in the year 1759. Of the family nothing"
377,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",more can be related worthy of notice. Johnson did not delight in talking
378,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","of his relations. ""There is little pleasure,"" he said to Mrs. Piozzi,"
379,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","""in relating the anecdotes of beggary."""
380,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
381,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Johnson derived from his parents, or from an unwholesome nurse, the"
382,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",distemper called the king's evil. The Jacobites at that time believed in
383,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the efficacy of the royal touch, and, accordingly, Mrs. Johnson"
384,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","presented her son, when two years old, before queen Anne, who, for the"
385,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","first time, performed that office, and communicated to her young patient"
386,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",all the healing virtue in her power[c]. He was afterwards cut for that
387,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","scrophulous humour, and the under part of his face was seamed and"
388,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","disfigured by the operation. It is supposed, that this disease deprived"
389,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","him of the sight of his left eye, and also impaired his hearing. At"
390,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","eight years old, he was placed under Mr. Hawkins, at the free school in"
391,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Lichfield, where he was not remarkable for diligence or regular"
392,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","application. Whatever he read, his tenacious memory made his own. In the"
393,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","fields, with his schoolfellows, he talked more to himself than with his"
394,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","companions. In 1725, when he was about sixteen years old, he went on a"
395,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","visit to his cousin Cornelius Ford, who detained him for some months,"
396,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","and, in the mean time, assisted him in the classics. The general"
397,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","direction for his studies, which he then received, he related to Mrs."
398,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Piozzi. ""Obtain,"" says Ford, ""some general principles of every science:"
399,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","he who can talk only on one subject, or act only in one department, is"
400,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","seldom wanted, and, perhaps, never wished for; while the man of general"
401,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","knowledge can often benefit, and always please."" This advice Johnson"
402,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",seems to have pursued with a good inclination. His reading was always
403,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","desultory, seldom resting on any particular author, but rambling from"
404,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","one book to another, and, by hasty snatches, hoarding up a variety of"
405,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","knowledge. It may be proper, in this place, to mention another general"
406,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","rule laid down by Ford for Johnson's future conduct: ""You will make your"
407,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","way the more easily in the world, as you are contented to dispute no"
408,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","man's claim to conversation excellence: they will, therefore, more"
409,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","willingly allow your pretensions as a writer."" ""But,"" says Mrs. Piozzi,"
410,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","""the features of peculiarity, which mark a character to all succeeding"
411,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","generations, are slow in coming to their growth."" That ingenious lady"
412,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","adds, with her usual vivacity, ""Can one, on such an occasion, forbear"
413,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","recollecting the predictions of Boileau's father, who said, stroking the"
414,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","head of the young satirist, 'This little man has too much wit, but he"
415,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","will never speak ill of any one.'"""
416,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
417,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","On Johnson's return from Cornelius Ford, Mr. Hunter, then master of the"
418,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","free school at Lichfield, refused to receive him again on that"
419,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","foundation. At this distance of time, what his reasons were, it is vain"
420,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",to inquire; but to refuse assistance to a lad of promising genius must
421,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","be pronounced harsh and illiberal. It did not, however, stop the"
422,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",progress of the young student's education. He was placed at another
423,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","school, at Stourbridge in Worcestershire, under the care of Mr."
424,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Wentworth. Having gone through the rudiments of classic literature, he"
425,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","returned to his father's house, and was probably intended for the trade"
426,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",of a bookseller. He has been heard to say that he could bind a book. At
427,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the end of two years, being then about nineteen, he went to assist the"
428,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","studies of a young gentleman, of the name of Corbet, to the university"
429,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","of Oxford; and on the 31st of October, 1728, both were entered of"
430,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Pembroke college; Corbet as a gentleman-commoner, and Johnson as a"
431,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","commoner. The college tutor, Mr. Jordan, was a man of no genius; and"
432,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Johnson, it seems, shewed an early contempt of mean abilities, in one or"
433,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",two instances behaving with insolence to that gentleman. Of his general
434,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","conduct at the university there are no particulars that merit attention,"
435,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","except the translation of Pope's Messiah, which was a college exercise"
436,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",imposed upon him as a task by Mr. Jordan. Corbet left the university in
437,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","about two years, and Johnson's salary ceased. He was, by consequence,"
438,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",straitened in his circumstances; but he still remained at college. Mr.
439,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Jordan, the tutor, went off to a living; and was succeeded by Dr. Adams,"
440,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","who afterwards became head of the college, and was esteemed through life"
441,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","for his learning, his talents, and his amiable character. Johnson grew"
442,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","more regular in his attendance. Ethics, theology, and classic"
443,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","literature, were his favourite studies. He discovered, notwithstanding,"
444,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","early symptoms of that wandering disposition of mind, which adhered to"
445,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","him to the end of his life. His reading was by fits and starts,"
446,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","undirected to any particular science. General philology, agreeably to"
447,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","his cousin Ford's advice, was the object of his ambition. He received,"
448,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","at that time, an early impression of piety, and a taste for the best"
449,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","authors, ancient and modern. It may, notwithstanding, be questioned"
450,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","whether, except his bible, he ever read a book entirely through. Late in"
451,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","life, if any man praised a book in his presence, he was sure to ask,"
452,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","""Did you read it through?"" If the answer was in the affirmative, he did"
453,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","not seem willing to believe it. He continued at the university, till the"
454,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","want of pecuniary supplies obliged him to quit the place. He obtained,"
455,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","however, the assistance of a friend, and, returning in a short time, was"
456,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",able to complete a residence of three years. The history of his exploits
457,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","at Oxford, he used to say, was best known to Dr. Taylor and Dr. Adams."
458,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Wonders are told of his memory, and, indeed, all who knew him late in"
459,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","life can witness, that he retained that faculty in the greatest vigour."
460,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
461,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","From the university, Johnson returned to Lichfield. His father died soon"
462,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","after, December, 1731; and the whole receipt out of his effects, as"
463,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","appeared by a memorandum in the son's handwriting, dated 15th of June,"
464,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","1732, was no more than twenty pounds[d]. In this exigence, determined"
465,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","that poverty should neither depress his spirits nor warp his integrity,"
466,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","he became under-master of a grammar school at Market Bosworth, in"
467,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Leicestershire. That resource, however, did not last long. Disgusted by"
468,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the pride of sir Wolstan Dixie, the patron of that little seminary, he"
469,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","left the place in discontent, and ever after spoke of it with"
470,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","abhorrence. In 1733, he went on a visit to Mr. Hector, who had been his"
471,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","schoolfellow, and was then a surgeon at Birmingham, lodging at the house"
472,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","of Warren, a bookseller. At that place Johnson translated a Voyage to"
473,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Abyssinia, written by Jerome Lobo, a Portuguese missionary. This was the"
474,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","first literary work from the pen of Dr. Johnson. His friend, Hector, was"
475,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","occasionally his amanuensis. The work was, probably, undertaken at the"
476,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","desire of Warren, the bookseller, and was printed at Birmingham; but it"
477,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","appears, in the Literary Magazine, or history of the works of the"
478,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","learned, for March, 1735, that it was published by Bettesworth and"
479,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Hitch, Paternoster row. It contains a narrative of the endeavours of a"
480,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",company of missionaries to convert the people of Abyssinia to the church
481,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","of Rome. In the preface to this work, Johnson observes, ""that the"
482,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Portuguese traveller, contrary to the general view of his countrymen,"
483,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","has amused his readers with no romantick absurdities, or incredible"
484,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","fictions. He appears, by his modest and unaffected narration, to have"
485,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","described things, as he saw them; to have copied nature from the life;"
486,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","and to have consulted his senses, not his imagination. He meets with no"
487,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","basilisks, that destroy with their eyes; his crocodiles devour their"
488,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","prey, without tears; and his cataracts fall from the rock, without"
489,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",deafening the neighbouring inhabitants. The reader will here find no
490,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","regions cursed with irremediable barrenness, or blessed with spontaneous"
491,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","fecundity; no perpetual gloom, or unceasing sunshine; nor are the"
492,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","nations, here described, either void of all sense of humanity, or"
493,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",consummate in all private and social virtues; here are no Hottentots
494,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","without religion, polity or articulate language; no Chinese perfectly"
495,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","polite, and completely skilled in all sciences; he will discover, what"
496,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","will always be discovered by a diligent and impartial inquirer, that,"
497,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","wherever human nature is to be found, there is a mixture of vice and"
498,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","virtue, a contest of passion and reason; and that the Creator doth not"
499,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","appear partial in his distributions, but has balanced, in most"
500,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","countries, their particular inconveniencies, by particular favours.""--We"
501,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","have here an early specimen of Johnson's manner; the vein of thinking,"
502,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","and the frame of the sentences, are manifestly his: we see the infant"
503,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",Hercules. The translation of Lobo's narrative has been reprinted lately
504,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","in a separate volume, with some other tracts of Dr. Johnson's, and,"
505,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","therefore, forms no part of this edition; but a compendious account of"
506,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","so interesting a work, as father Lobo's discovery of the head of the"
507,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Nile, will not, it is imagined, be unacceptable to the reader."
508,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
509,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","""Father Lobo, the Portuguese missionary, embarked, in 1622, in the same"
510,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","fleet with the count Vidigueira, who was appointed, by the king of"
511,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Portugal, viceroy of the Indies. They arrived at Goa; and, in January"
512,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","1624, father Lobo set out on the mission to Abyssinia. Two of the"
513,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Jesuits, sent on the same commission, were murdered in their attempt to"
514,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",penetrate into that empire. Lobo had better success; he surmounted all
515,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","difficulties, and made his way into the heart of the country. Then"
516,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","follows a description of Abyssinia, formerly the largest empire of which"
517,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",we have an account in history. It extended from the Red sea to the
518,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","kingdom of Congo, and from Egypt to the Indian sea, containing no less"
519,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","than forty provinces. At the time of Lobo's mission, it was not much"
520,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","larger than Spain, consisting then but of five kingdoms, of which part"
521,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","was entirely subject to the emperour, and part paid him a tribute, as an"
522,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","acknowledgment. The provinces were inhabited by Moors, Pagans, Jews, and"
523,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Christians. The last was, in Lobo's time, the established and reigning"
524,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",religion. The diversity of people and religion is the reason why the
525,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","kingdom was under different forms of government, with laws and customs"
526,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","extremely various. Some of the people neither sowed their lands, nor"
527,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","improved them by any kind of culture, living upon milk and flesh, and,"
528,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","like the Arabs, encamping without any settled habitation. In some places"
529,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","they practised no rites of worship, though they believed that, in the"
530,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","regions above, there dwells a being that governs the world. This deity"
531,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","they call, in their language, Oul. The christianity, professed by the"
532,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","people in some parts, is so corrupted with superstitions, errours, and"
533,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","heresies, and so mingled with ceremonies borrowed from the Jews, that"
534,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","little, besides the name of christianity, is to be found among them. The"
535,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",Abyssins cannot properly be said to have either cities or houses; they
536,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","live in tents or cottages made of straw or clay, very rarely building"
537,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","with stone. Their villages, or towns, consist of these huts; yet even of"
538,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","such villages they have but few, because the grandees, the viceroys, and"
539,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the emperour himself, are always in camp, that they may be prepared,"
540,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","upon the most sudden alarm, to meet every emergence in a country, which"
541,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","is engaged, every year, either in foreign wars or intestine commotions."
542,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Aethiopia produces very near the same kinds of provision as Portugal,"
543,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","though, by the extreme laziness of the inhabitants, in a much less"
544,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",quantity. What the ancients imagined of the torrid zone being a part of
545,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the world uninhabitable, is so far from being true, that the climate is"
546,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","very temperate. The blacks have better features than in other countries,"
547,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","and are not without wit and ingenuity. Their apprehension is quick, and"
548,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","their judgment sound. There are, in this climate, two harvests in the"
549,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","year; one in winter, which lasts through the months of July, August, and"
550,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","September; the other in the spring. They have, in the greatest plenty,"
551,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","raisins peaches pomegranates, sugar-canes, and some figs. Most of these"
552,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","are ripe about lent, which the Abyssins keep with great strictness. The"
553,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","animals of the country are the lion, the elephant, the rhinoceros, the"
554,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","unicorn, horses, mules, oxen, and cows without number. They have a very"
555,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","particular custom, which obliges every man, that has a thousand cows, to"
556,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","save every year one day's milk of all his herd, and make a bath with it"
557,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","for his relations. This they do so many days in each year, as they have"
558,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","thousands of cattle; so that, to express how rich a man is, they tell"
559,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","you, 'he bathes so many times.'"
560,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
561,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","""Of the river Nile, which has furnished so much controversy, we have a"
562,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","full and clear description. It is called, by the natives, Abavi, the"
563,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Father of Water. It rises in Sacala, a province of the kingdom of"
564,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Goiama, the most fertile and agreeable part of the Abyssinian dominions."
565,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","On the eastern side of the country, on the declivity of a mountain,"
566,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","whose descent is so easy, that it seems a beautiful plain, is that"
567,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","source of the Nile, which has been sought after, at so much expense and"
568,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","labour. This spring, or rather these two springs, are two holes, each"
569,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","about two feet diameter, a stone's cast distant from each other. One of"
570,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",them is about five feet and a half in depth. Lobo was not able to sink
571,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","his plummet lower, perhaps, because it was stopped by roots, the whole"
572,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",place being full of trees. A line of ten feet did not reach the bottom
573,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","of the other. These springs are supposed, by the Abyssins, to be the"
574,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","vents of a great subterraneous lake. At a small distance to the south,"
575,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","is a village called Guix, through which you ascend to the top of the"
576,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","mountain, where there is a little hill, which the idolatrous Agaci hold"
577,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",in great veneration. Their priest calls them together to this place once
578,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","a year; and every one sacrifices a cow, or more, according to the"
579,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",different degrees of wealth and devotion. Hence we have sufficient
580,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","proof, that these nations always paid adoration to the deity of this"
581,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",famous river.
582,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
583,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","""As to the course of the Nile, its waters, after their first rise, run"
584,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","towards the east, about the length of a musket-shot; then, turning"
585,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","northward, continue hidden in the grass and weeds for about a quarter of"
586,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","a league, when they reappear amongst a quantity of rocks. The Nile, from"
587,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","its source, proceeds with so inconsiderable a current that it is in"
588,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",danger of being dried up by the hot season; but soon receiving an
589,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","increase from the Gemma, the Keltu, the Bransa, and the other smaller"
590,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","rivers, it expands to such a breadth in the plains of Boad, which is not"
591,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","above three days' journey from its source, that a musket-ball will"
592,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",scarcely fly from one bank to the other. Here it begins to run
593,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","northward, winding, however, a little to the east, for the space of nine"
594,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","or ten leagues, and then enters the so-much-talked-of lake of Dambia,"
595,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","flowing with such violent rapidity, that its waters may be distinguished"
596,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","through the whole passage, which is no less than six leagues. Here"
597,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","begins the greatness of the Nile. Fifteen miles farther, in the land of"
598,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Alata, it rushes precipitately from the top of a high rock, and forms"
599,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","one of the most beautiful waterfalls in the world. Lobo says, he passed"
600,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","under it without being wet, and resting himself, for the sake of the"
601,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","coolness, was charmed with a thousand delightful rainbows, which the"
602,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","sunbeams painted on the water, in all their shining and lively"
603,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","colours[e]. The fall of this mighty stream, from so great a height,"
604,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",makes a noise that may be heard at a considerable distance: but it was
605,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","not found, that the neighbouring inhabitants were deaf. After the"
606,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","cataract, the Nile collects its scattered stream among the rocks, which"
607,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","are so near each other, that, in Lobo's time, a bridge of beams, on"
608,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","which the whole imperial army passed, was laid over them. Sultan Sequed"
609,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","has since built a stone bridge of one arch, in the same place, for which"
610,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","purpose he procured masons from India. Here the river alters its course,"
611,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","and passes through various kingdoms, such as Amhara, Olaca, Choaa,"
612,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Damot, and the kingdom of Goiama, and, after various windings, returns"
613,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",within a short day's journey of its spring. To pursue it through all its
614,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","mazes, and accompany it round the kingdom of Goiama, is a journey of"
615,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","twenty-nine days. From Abyssinia, the river passes into the countries of"
616,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Fazulo and Ombarca, two vast regions little known, inhabited by nations"
617,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","entirely different from the Abyssins. Their hair, like that of the other"
618,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","blacks in those regions, is short and curled. In the year 1615, Rassela"
619,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Christos, lieutenant-general to sultan Sequed, entered those kingdoms in"
620,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","a hostile manner; but, not being able to get intelligence, returned"
621,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",without attempting any thing. As the empire of Abyssinia terminates at
622,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","these descents, Lobo followed the course of the Nile no farther, leaving"
623,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","it to rage over barbarous kingdoms, and convey wealth and plenty into"
624,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Aegypt, which owes to the annual inundations of this river its envied"
625,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","fertility[f]. Lobo knows nothing of the Nile in the rest of its passage,"
626,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","except that it receives great increase from many other rivers, has"
627,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","several cataracts like that already described, and that few fish are to"
628,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","be found in it: that scarcity is to be attributed to the river-horse,"
629,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","and the crocodile, which destroy the weaker inhabitants of the river."
630,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Something, likewise, must be imputed to the cataracts, where fish cannot"
631,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","fall without being killed. Lobo adds, that neither he, nor any with whom"
632,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","he conversed about the crocodile, ever saw him weep; and, therefore, all"
633,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","that hath been said about his tears, must be ranked among the fables,"
634,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",invented for the amusement of children.
635,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
636,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","""As to the causes of the inundations of the Nile, Lobo observes, that"
637,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",many an idle hypothesis has been framed. Some theorists ascribe it to
638,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the high winds, that stop the current, and force the water above its"
639,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",banks. Others pretend a subterraneous communication between the ocean
640,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","and the Nile, and that the sea, when violently agitated, swells the"
641,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","river. Many are of opinion, that this mighty flood proceeds from the"
642,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",melting of the snow on the mountains of Aethiopia; but so much snow and
643,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",such prodigious heat are never met with in the same region. Lobo never
644,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","saw snow in Abyssinia, except on mount Semen, in the kingdom of Tigre,"
645,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","very remote from the Nile; and on Namara, which is, indeed, nor far"
646,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","distant, but where there never falls snow enough to wet, when dissolved,"
647,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",the foot of the mountain. To the immense labours of the Portuguese
648,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",mankind is indebted for the knowledge of the real cause of these
649,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","inundations, so great and so regular. By them we are informed, that"
650,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Abyssinia, where the Nile rises, is full of mountains, and, in its"
651,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","natural situation, is much higher than Aegypt; that in the winter, from"
652,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","June to September, no day is without rain; that the Nile receives in its"
653,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","course, all the rivers, brooks, and torrents, that fall from those"
654,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","mountains, and, by necessary consequence, swelling above its banks,"
655,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","fills the plains of Aegypt with inundations, which come regularly about"
656,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the month of July, or three weeks after the beginning of the rainy"
657,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",season in Aethiopia. The different degrees of this flood are such
658,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",certain indications of the fruitfulness or sterility of the ensuing
659,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","year, that it is publickly proclaimed at Cairo how much the water hath"
660,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","gained during the night."""
661,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
662,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Such is the account of the Nile and its inundations, which, it is hoped,"
663,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","will not be deemed an improper or tedious digression, especially as the"
664,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","whole is an extract from Johnson's translation. He is, all the time, the"
665,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","actor in the scene, and, in his own words, relates the story. Having"
666,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","finished this work, he returned in February, 1734, to his native city;"
667,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","and, in the month of August following, published proposals for printing,"
668,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","by subscription, the Latin poems of Politian, with the history of Latin"
669,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","poetry, from the aera of Petrarch to the time of Politian; and also the"
670,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","life of Politian, to be added by the editor, Samuel Johnson. The book to"
671,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","be printed in thirty octavo sheets, price five shillings. It is to be"
672,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","regretted that this project failed for want of encouragement. Johnson,"
673,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","it seems, differed from Boileau, Voltaire, and D'Alembert, who had taken"
674,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",upon them to proscribe all modern efforts to write with elegance in a
675,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","dead language. For a decision pronounced in so high a tone, no good"
676,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","reason can be assigned. The interests of learning require, that the"
677,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",diction of Greece and Rome should be cultivated with care; and he who
678,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","can write a language with correctness, will be most likely to understand"
679,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","its idiom, its grammar, and its peculiar graces of style. What man of"
680,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","taste would willingly forego the pleasure of reading Vida, Fracastorius,"
681,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Sannazaro, Strada, and others, down to the late elegant productions of"
682,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","bishop Lowth? The history which Johnson proposed to himself would,"
683,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","beyond all question, have been a valuable addition to the history of"
684,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",letters; but his project failed. His next expedient was to offer his
685,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","assistance to Cave, the original projector of the Gentleman's Magazine."
686,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","For this purpose he sent his proposals in a letter, offering, on"
687,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","reasonable terms, occasionally to fill some pages with poems and"
688,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","inscriptions, never printed before; with fugitive pieces that deserved"
689,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","to be revived, and critical remarks on authors, ancient and modern. Cave"
690,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",agreed to retain him as a correspondent and contributor to the magazine.
691,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","What the conditions were cannot now be known; but, certainly, they were"
692,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",not sufficient to hinder Johnson from casting his eyes about him in
693,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","quest of other employment. Accordingly, in 1735, he made overtures to"
694,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the reverend Mr. Budworth, master of a grammar school at Brerewood, in"
695,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Staffordshire, to become his assistant. This proposition did not"
696,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","succeed. Mr. Budworth apprehended, that the involuntary motions, to"
697,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","which Johnson's nerves were subject, might make him an object of"
698,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","ridicule with his scholars, and, by consequence, lessen their respect"
699,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",for their master. Another mode of advancing himself presented itself
700,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","about this time. Mrs. Porter, the widow of a mercer in Birmingham,"
701,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","admired his talents. It is said, that she had about eight hundred"
702,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","pounds; and that sum, to a person in Johnson's circumstances, was an"
703,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","affluent fortune. A marriage took place; and, to turn his wife's money"
704,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","to the best advantage, he projected the scheme of an academy for"
705,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","education. Gilbert Walmsley, at that time, registrar of the"
706,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","ecclesiastical court of the bishop of Lichfield, was distinguished by"
707,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","his erudition, and the politeness of his manners. He was the friend of"
708,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Johnson, and, by his weight and influence, endeavoured to promote his"
709,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","interest. The celebrated Garrick, whose father, captain Garrick, lived"
710,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","at Lichfield, was placed in the new seminary of education by that"
711,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",gentleman's advice.--Garrick was then about eighteen years old. An
712,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","accession of seven or eight pupils was the most that could be obtained,"
713,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","though notice was given by a public advertisement[g], that at Edial,"
714,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","near Lichfield, in Staffordshire, young gentlemen are boarded and taught"
715,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the Latin and Greek languages, by Samuel Johnson."
716,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
717,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","The undertaking proved abortive. Johnson, having now abandoned all hopes"
718,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","of promoting his fortune in the country, determined to become an"
719,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","adventurer in the world at large. His young pupil, Garrick, had formed"
720,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the same resolution; and, accordingly, in March, 1737, they arrived in"
721,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","London together. Two such candidates for fame, perhaps never, before"
722,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","that day, entered the metropolis together. Their stock of money was soon"
723,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","exhausted. In his visionary project of an academy, Johnson had probably"
724,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",wasted his wife's substance; and Garrick's father had little more than
725,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","his half-pay.--The two fellow-travellers had the world before them, and"
726,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",each was to choose his road to fortune and to fame. They brought with
727,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","them genius, and powers of mind, peculiarly formed by nature for the"
728,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",different vocations to which each of them felt himself inclined. They
729,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","acted from the impulse of young minds, even then meditating great"
730,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","things, and with courage anticipating success. Their friend, Mr."
731,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Walmsley, by a letter to the reverend Mr. Colson, who, it seems, was a"
732,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","great mathematician, exerted his good offices in their favour. He gave"
733,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","notice of their intended journey: ""Davy Garrick,"" he said, ""will be with"
734,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","you next week; and Johnson, to try his fate with a tragedy, and to get"
735,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","himself employed in some translation, either from the Latin or French."
736,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Johnson is a very good scholar and a poet, and, I have great hopes, will"
737,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","turn out a fine tragedy-writer. If it should be in your way, I doubt not"
738,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","but you will be ready to recommend and assist your countrymen."" Of Mr."
739,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Walmsley's merit, and the excellence of his character, Johnson has left"
740,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",a beautiful testimonial at the end of the life of Edmund Smith. It is
741,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","reasonable to conclude, that a mathematician, absorbed in abstract"
742,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","speculations, was not able to find a sphere of action for two men, who"
743,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",were to be the architects of their own fortune. In three or four years
744,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","afterwards, Garrick came forth with talents that astonished the public."
745,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","He began his career at Goodman's fields, and there, ""monstratus fatis"
746,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Vespasianus!"" he chose a lucrative profession, and, consequently, soon"
747,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",emerged from all his difficulties. Johnson was left to toil in the
748,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","humble walks of literature. A tragedy, as appears by Walmsley's letter,"
749,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","was the whole of his stock. This, most probably, was Irene; but, if then"
750,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","finished, it was doomed to wait for a more happy period. It was offered"
751,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","to Fleetwood, and rejected. Johnson looked round him for employment."
752,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Having, while he remained in the country, corresponded with Cave, under"
753,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","a feigned name, he now thought it time to make himself known to a man,"
754,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","whom he considered as a patron of literature. Cave had announced, by"
755,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","public advertisement, a prize of fifty pounds for the best poem on life,"
756,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","death, judgment, heaven, and hell; and this circumstance diffused an"
757,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","idea of his liberality. Johnson became connected with him in business,"
758,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",and in a close and intimate acquaintance. Of Cave's character it is
759,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","unnecessary to say any thing in this place, as Johnson was afterwards"
760,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",the biographer of his first and most useful patron. To be engaged in the
761,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",translation of some important book was still the object which Johnson
762,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","had in view. For this purpose, he proposed to give the history of the"
763,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","council of Trent, with copious notes, then lately added to a French"
764,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","edition. Twelve sheets of this work were printed, for which Johnson"
765,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","received forty-nine pounds, as appears by his receipt, in the"
766,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","possession of Mr. Nichols, the compiler of that entertaining and useful"
767,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","work, The Gentleman's Magazine. Johnson's translation was never"
768,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","completed: a like design was offered to the public, under the patronage"
769,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","of Dr. Zachary Pearce; and, by that contention, both attempts were"
770,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","frustrated. Johnson had been commended by Pope, for the translation of"
771,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",the Messiah into Latin verse; but he knew no approach to so eminent a
772,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","man. With one, however, who was connected with Pope, he became"
773,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",acquainted at St. John's gate; and that person was no other than the
774,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","well-known Richard Savage, whose life was afterwards written by Johnson"
775,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","with great elegance, and a depth of moral reflection. Savage was a man"
776,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","of considerable talents. His address, his various accomplishments, and,"
777,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","above all, the peculiarity of his misfortunes, recommended him to"
778,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",Johnson's notice. They became united in the closest intimacy. Both had
779,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","great parts, and they were equally under the pressure of want. Sympathy"
780,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",joined them in a league of friendship. Johnson has been often heard to
781,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","relate, that he and Savage walked round Grosvenor square till four in"
782,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the morning; in the course of their conversation reforming the world,"
783,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","dethroning princes, establishing new forms of government, and giving"
784,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","laws to the several states of Europe, till, fatigued at length with"
785,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","their legislative office, they began to feel the want of refreshment,"
786,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","but could not muster up more than four-pence-halfpenny. Savage, it is"
787,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","true, had many vices; but vice could never strike its roots in a mind"
788,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","like Johnson's, seasoned early with religion, and the principles of"
789,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",moral rectitude. His first prayer was composed in the year 1738. He had
790,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","not, at that time, renounced the use of wine; and, no doubt,"
791,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","occasionally enjoyed his friend and his bottle. The love of late hours,"
792,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","which followed him through life, was, perhaps, originally contracted in"
793,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","company with Savage. However that may be, their connexion was not of"
794,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","long duration. In the year 1738, Savage was reduced to the last"
795,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","distress. Mr. Pope, in a letter to him, expressed his concern for ""the"
796,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","miserable withdrawing of his pension after the death of the queen;"" and"
797,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","gave him hopes that, ""in a short time, he should find himself supplied"
798,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","with a competence, without any dependance on those little creatures,"
799,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","whom we are pleased to call the great."" The scheme proposed to him was,"
800,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","that he should retire to Swansea in Wales, and receive an allowance of"
801,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","fifty pounds a year, to be raised by subscription: Pope was to pay"
802,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","twenty pounds. This plan, though finally established, took more than a"
803,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","year before it was carried into execution. In the mean time, the"
804,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",intended retreat of Savage called to Johnson's mind the third satire of
805,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Juvenal, in which that poet takes leave of a friend, who was withdrawing"
806,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","himself from all the vices of Rome. Struck with this idea, he wrote that"
807,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","well-known poem, called London. The first lines manifestly point to"
808,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",Savage.
809,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
810,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","""Though grief and fondness in my breast rebel,"
811,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",When injur'd Thales bids the town farewell;
812,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",Yet still my calmer thoughts his choice commend;
813,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","I praise the hermit, but regret the friend:"
814,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Resolv'd, at length, from vice and London far,"
815,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","To breathe, in distant fields, a purer air;"
816,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","And, fix'd on Cambria's solitary shore,"
817,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Give to St. David one true Briton more."""
818,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
819,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Johnson, at that time, lodged at Greenwich. He there fixes the scene,"
820,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","and takes leave of his friend; who, he says in his life, parted from him"
821,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","with tears in his eyes. The poem, when finished, was offered to Cave. It"
822,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","happened, however, that the late Mr. Dodsley was the purchaser, at the"
823,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","price of ten guineas. It was published in 1738; and Pope, we are told,"
824,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","said, ""The author, whoever he is, will not be long concealed;"" alluding"
825,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","to the passage in Terence, ""Ubi, ubi est, diu celari non potest."""
826,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Notwithstanding that prediction, it does not appear that, besides the"
827,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","copy-money, any advantage accrued to the author of a poem, written with"
828,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the elegance and energy of Pope. Johnson, in August, 1738, went, with"
829,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","all the fame of his poetry, to offer himself a candidate for the"
830,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","mastership of the school at Appleby, in Leicestershire. The statutes of"
831,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the place required, that the person chosen should be a master of arts."
832,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","To remove this objection, the then lord Gower was induced to write to a"
833,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","friend, in order to obtain for Johnson a master's degree in the"
834,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","university of Dublin, by the recommendation of Dr. Swift. The letter was"
835,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","printed in one of the magazines, and was as follows:"
836,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
837,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","SIR,--Mr. Samuel Johnson, author of London, a satire, and some other"
838,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","poetical pieces, is a native of this county, and much respected by some"
839,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","worthy gentlemen in the neighbourhood, who are trustees of a"
840,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","charity-school, now vacant; the certain salary of which is sixty pounds"
841,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","per year, of which they are desirous to make him master; but,"
842,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","unfortunately, he is not capable of receiving their bounty, which would"
843,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","make him happy for life, by not being a master of arts, which, by the"
844,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","statutes of the school, the master of it must be."
845,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
846,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Now these gentlemen do me the honour to think, that I have interest"
847,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","enough in you, to prevail upon you to write to dean Swift, to persuade"
848,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the university of Dublin to send a diploma to me, constituting this poor"
849,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",man master of arts in their university. They highly extol the man's
850,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","learning and probity; and will not be persuaded, that the university"
851,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","will make any difficulty of conferring such a favour upon a stranger, if"
852,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","he is recommended by the dean. They say, he is not afraid of the"
853,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","strictest examination, though he is of so long a journey; and yet he"
854,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","will venture it, if the dean thinks it necessary, choosing rather to die"
855,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","upon the road, than to be starved to death in translating for"
856,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","booksellers, which has been his only subsistence for some time past."
857,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
858,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",I fear there is more difficulty in this affair than these good-natured
859,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","gentlemen apprehend, especially as their election cannot be delayed"
860,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",longer than the eleventh of next month. If you see this matter in the
861,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","same light that it appears to me, I hope you will burn this, and pardon"
862,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","me for giving you so much trouble about an impracticable thing; but, if"
863,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","you think there is a probability of obtaining the favour asked, I am"
864,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","sure your humanity and propensity to relieve merit, in distress, will"
865,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","incline you to serve the poor man, without my adding any more to the"
866,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","trouble I have already given you, than assuring you, that I am, with"
867,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","great truth, sir,"
868,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
869,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Your faithful humble servant,"
870,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
871,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Trentham, Aug. 1st.              GOWER."
872,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
873,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","This scheme miscarried. There is reason to think, that Swift declined to"
874,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","meddle in the business; and, to that circumstance, Johnson's known"
875,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",dislike of Swift has been often imputed.
876,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
877,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",It is mortifying to pursue a man of merit through all his difficulties;
878,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","and yet this narrative must be, through many following years, the"
879,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",history of genius and virtue struggling with adversity. Having lost the
880,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","school at Appleby, Johnson was thrown back on the metropolis. Bred to no"
881,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","profession, without relations, friends, or interest, he was condemned to"
882,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","drudgery in the service of Cave, his only patron. In November, 1738, was"
883,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",published a translation of Crousaz's Examen of Pope's Essay on Man;
884,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","containing a succinct view of the system of the fatalists, and a"
885,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",confutation of their opinions; with an illustration of the doctrine of
886,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","free will; and an enquiry, what view Mr. Pope might have in touching"
887,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","upon the Leibnitzian philosophy, and fatalism: by Mr. Crousaz, professor"
888,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",of philosophy and mathematics at Lausanne. This translation has been
889,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","generally thought a production of Johnson's pen; but it is now known,"
890,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",that Mrs. Elizabeth Carter has acknowledged it to be one of her early
891,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","performances. It is certain, however, that Johnson was eager to promote"
892,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",the publication. He considered the foreign philosopher as a man zealous
893,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",in the cause of religion; and with him he was willing to join against
894,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the system of the fatalists, and the doctrine of Leibnitz. It is well"
895,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","known, that Warburton wrote a vindication of Mr. Pope; but there is"
896,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","reason to think, that Johnson conceived an early prejudice against the"
897,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Essay on Man; and what once took root in a mind like his, was not easily"
898,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","eradicated. His letter to Cave on this subject is still extant, and may"
899,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","well justify sir John Hawkins, who inferred that Johnson was the"
900,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","translator of Crousaz. The conclusion of the letter is remarkable: ""I am"
901,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","yours, Impransus."" If by that Latin word was meant, that he had not"
902,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","dined, because he wanted the means, who can read it, even at this hour,"
903,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",without an aching heart?
904,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
905,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","With a mind naturally vigorous, and quickened by necessity, Johnson"
906,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",formed a multiplicity of projects; but most of them proved abortive. A
907,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",number of small tracts issued from his pen with wonderful rapidity; such
908,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",as Marmor Norfolciense; or an essay on an ancient prophetical
909,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","inscription, in monkish rhyme, discovered at Lynn, in Norfolk. By Probus"
910,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",Britannicus. This was a pamphlet against sir Robert Walpole. According
911,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","to sir John Hawkins, a warrant was issued to apprehend the author, who"
912,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","retired, with his wife, to an obscure lodging near Lambeth marsh, and"
913,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",there eluded the search of the messengers. But this story has no
914,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",foundation in truth. Johnson was never known to mention such an incident
915,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","in his life; and Mr. Steele, late of the treasury, caused diligent"
916,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","search to be made at the proper offices, and no trace of such a"
917,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",proceeding could be found. In the same year (1739) the lord chamberlain
918,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","prohibited the representation of a tragedy, called Gustavus Vasa, by"
919,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Henry Brooke. Under the mask of irony, Johnson published, A Vindication"
920,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",of the Licenser from the malicious and scandalous Aspersions of Mr.
921,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Brooke. Of these two pieces, sir John Hawkins says, ""they have neither"
922,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","learning nor wit; nor a single ray of that genius, which has since"
923,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","blazed forth;"" but, as they have been lately reprinted, the reader, who"
924,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","wishes to gratify his curiosity, is referred to the fourteenth volume of"
925,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Johnson's works, published by Stockdale[h]. The lives of Boerhaave,"
926,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Blake, Barratier, father Paul, and others, were, about that time,"
927,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",printed in the Gentleman's Magazine. The subscription of fifty pounds a
928,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","year for Savage was completed; and, in July 1739, Johnson parted with"
929,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the companion of his midnight hours, never to see him more. The"
930,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","separation was, perhaps, an advantage to him, who wanted to make a right"
931,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","use of his time, and even then beheld, with self-reproach, the waste"
932,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",occasioned by dissipation. His abstinence from wine and strong liquors
933,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",began soon after the departure of Savage. What habits he contracted in
934,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",the course of that acquaintance cannot now be known. The ambition of
935,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","excelling in conversation, and that pride of victory, which, at times,"
936,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","disgraced a man of Johnson's genius, were, perhaps, native blemishes. A"
937,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","fierce spirit of independence, even in the midst of poverty, may be seen"
938,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","in Savage; and, if not thence transfused by Johnson into his own"
939,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","manners, it may, at least, be supposed to have gained strength from the"
940,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","example before him. During that connexion, there was, if we believe sir"
941,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","John Hawkins, a short separation between our author and his wife; but a"
942,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","reconciliation soon took place. Johnson loved her, and showed his"
943,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","affection in various modes of gallantry, which Garrick used to render"
944,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",ridiculous by his mimicry. The affectation of soft and fashionable airs
945,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",did not become an unwieldy figure: his admiration was received by the
946,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","wife with the flutter of an antiquated coquette; and both, it is well"
947,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","known, furnished matter for the lively genius of Garrick."
948,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
949,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","It is a mortifying reflection, that Johnson, with a store of learning"
950,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","and extraordinary talents, was not able, at the age of thirty, to force"
951,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",his way to the favour of the public:
952,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
953,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","""Slow rises worth by poverty depress'd."""
954,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
955,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","""He was still,"" as he says himself, ""to provide for the day that was"
956,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","passing over him."" He saw Cave involved in a state of warfare with the"
957,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","numerous competitors, at that time, struggling with the Gentleman's"
958,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Magazine; and gratitude for such supplies as Johnson received, dictated"
959,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","a Latin ode on the subject of that contention. The first lines,"
960,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
961,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","""Urbane, nullis fesse laboribus,"
962,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Urbane, nullis victe calumniis,"""
963,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
964,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",put one in mind of Casimir's ode to Pope Urban:
965,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
966,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","""Urbane, regum maxime, maxime"
967,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Urbane vatum.""--"
968,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
969,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","The Polish poet was, probably, at that time, in the hands of a man, who"
970,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","had meditated the history of the Latin poets. Guthrie, the historian,"
971,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","had, from July, 1736, composed the parliamentary speeches for the"
972,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","magazine; but, from the beginning of the session, which opened on the"
973,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","19th of November, 1740, Johnson succeeded to that department, and"
974,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","continued it from that time to the debate on spirituous liquors, which"
975,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","happened in the house of lords, in February, 1742-3. The eloquence, the"
976,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","force of argument, and the splendor of language, displayed in the"
977,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","several speeches, are well known, and universally admired. That Johnson"
978,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","was the author of the debates, during that period, was not generally"
979,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","known; but the secret transpired several years afterwards, and was"
980,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","avowed, by himself, on the following occasion. Mr. Wedderburne, now lord"
981,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Loughborough[i], Dr. Johnson, Dr. Francis, the translator of Horace, the"
982,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","present writer, and others, dined with the late Mr. Foote. An important"
983,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","debate, towards the end of sir Robert Walpole's administration, being"
984,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","mentioned, Dr. Francis observed, ""that Mr. Pitt's speech, on that"
985,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","occasion, was the best he had ever read."" He added, ""that he had"
986,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","employed eight years of his life in the study of Demosthenes, and"
987,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","finished a translation of that celebrated orator, with all the"
988,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",decorations of style and language within the reach of his capacity; but
989,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","he had met with nothing equal to the speech above mentioned."" Many of"
990,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the company remembered the debate, and some passages were cited, with"
991,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",the approbation and applause of all present. During the ardour of
992,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","conversation, Johnson remained silent. As soon as the warmth of praise"
993,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","subsided, he opened with these words: ""That speech I wrote in a garret"
994,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","in Exeter street."" The company was struck with astonishment. After"
995,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","staring at each other in silent amaze, Dr. Francis asked, ""how that"
996,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","speech could be written by him?"" ""Sir,"" said Johnson, ""I wrote it in"
997,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",Exeter street. I never had been in the gallery of the house of commons
998,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","but once. Cave had interest with the door-keepers. He, and the persons"
999,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","employed under him, gained admittance; they brought away the subject of"
1000,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","discussion, the names of the speakers, the side they took, and the order"
1001,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","in which they rose, together with notes of the arguments advanced in the"
1002,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","course of the debate. The whole was afterwards communicated to me, and I"
1003,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",composed the speeches in the form which they now have in the
1004,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","parliamentary debates."" To this discovery, Dr. Francis made answer:"
1005,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","""Then, sir, you have exceeded Demosthenes himself; for to say, that you"
1006,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","have exceeded Francis's Demosthenes, would be saying nothing."" The rest"
1007,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","of the company bestowed lavish encomiums on Johnson: one, in particular,"
1008,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","praised his impartiality; observing, that he dealt out reason and"
1009,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","eloquence, with an equal hand to both parties. ""That is not quite true,"""
1010,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","said Johnson; ""I saved appearances tolerably well; but I took care that"
1011,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the WHIG DOGS should not have the best of it."" The sale of the magazine"
1012,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","was greatly increased by the parliamentary debates, which were continued"
1013,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","by Johnson till the month of March, 1742-3. From that time the magazine"
1014,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",was conducted by Dr. Hawkesworth.
1015,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
1016,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","In 1743-4, Osborne, the bookseller, who kept a shop in Gray's inn,"
1017,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","purchased the earl of Oxford's library, at the price of thirteen"
1018,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","thousand pounds. He projected a catalogue in five octavo volumes, at"
1019,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",five shillings each. Johnson was employed in that painful drudgery. He
1020,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","was, likewise, to collect all such small tracts as were, in any degree,"
1021,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","worth preserving, in order to reprint and publish the whole in a"
1022,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","collection, called The Harleian Miscellany. The catalogue was completed;"
1023,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","and the miscellany, in 1749, was published in eight quarto volumes. In"
1024,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","this business Johnson was a day-labourer for immediate subsistence, not"
1025,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","unlike Gustavus Vasa, working in the mines of Dalecarlia. What Wilcox, a"
1026,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","bookseller of eminence in the Strand, said to Johnson, on his first"
1027,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","arrival in town, was now almost confirmed. He lent our author five"
1028,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","guineas, and then asked him, ""How do you mean to earn your livelihood in"
1029,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","this town?"" ""By my literary labours,"" was the answer. Wilcox, staring at"
1030,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","him, shook his head: ""By your literary labours! You had better buy a"
1031,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","porter's knot."" Johnson used to tell this anecdote to Mr. Nichols: but"
1032,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","he said, ""Wilcox was one of my best friends, and he meant well."" In"
1033,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","fact, Johnson, while employed in Gray's inn, may be said to have carried"
1034,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",a porter's knot. He paused occasionally to peruse the book that came to
1035,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",his hand. Osborne thought that such curiosity tended to nothing but
1036,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","delay, and objected to it with all the pride and insolence of a man who"
1037,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","knew that he paid daily wages. In the dispute that of course ensued,"
1038,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Osborne, with that roughness which was natural to him, enforced his"
1039,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","argument by giving the lie. Johnson seized a folio, and knocked the"
1040,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",bookseller down. This story has been related as an instance of Johnson's
1041,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",ferocity; but merit cannot always take the spurns of the unworthy with a
1042,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",patient spirit[k].
1043,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
1044,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","That the history of an author must be found in his works is, in general,"
1045,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",a true observation; and was never more apparent than in the present
1046,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",narrative. Every aera of Johnson's life is fixed by his writings. In
1047,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","1744, he published the life of Savage; and then projected a new edition"
1048,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","of Shakespeare. As a prelude to that design, he published, in 1745,"
1049,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Miscellaneous Observations on the Tragedy of Macbeth, with remarks on"
1050,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","sir Thomas Hanmer's edition; to which were prefixed, Proposals for a new"
1051,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Edition of Shakespeare, with a specimen. Of this pamphlet, Warburton, in"
1052,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the preface to Shakespeare, has given his opinion: ""As to all those"
1053,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","things, which have been published under the title of essays, remarks,"
1054,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","observations, &c. on Shakespeare, if you except some critical notes on"
1055,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Macbeth, given as a specimen of a projected edition, and written, as"
1056,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","appears, by a man of parts and genius, the rest are absolutely below a"
1057,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","serious notice."" But the attention of the public was not excited; there"
1058,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",was no friend to promote a subscription; and the project died to revive
1059,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","at a future day. A new undertaking, however, was soon after proposed;"
1060,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","namely, an English dictionary upon an enlarged plan. Several of the most"
1061,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",opulent booksellers had meditated a work of this kind; and the agreement
1062,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","was soon adjusted between the parties. Emboldened by this connexion,"
1063,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",Johnson thought of a better habitation than he had hitherto known. He
1064,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","had lodged with his wife in courts and alleys about the Strand; but now,"
1065,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","for the purpose of carrying on his arduous undertaking, and to be nearer"
1066,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","his printer and friend, Mr. Strahan, he ventured to take a house in"
1067,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Gough square, Fleet street. He was told, that the earl of Chesterfield"
1068,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","was a friend to his undertaking; and, in consequence of that"
1069,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","intelligence, he published, in 1747, The Plan of a Dictionary of the"
1070,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","English Language, addressed to the right honourable Philip Dormer, earl"
1071,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","of Chesterfield, one of his majesty's principal secretaries of state."
1072,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Mr. Whitehead, afterwards poet laureate, undertook to convey the"
1073,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",manuscript to his lordship: the consequence was an invitation from lord
1074,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",Chesterfield to the author. A stronger contrast of characters could not
1075,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","be brought together; the nobleman, celebrated for his wit, and all the"
1076,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","graces of polite behaviour; the author, conscious of his own merit,"
1077,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","towering in idea above all competition, versed in scholastic logic, but"
1078,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","a stranger to the arts of polite conversation, uncouth, vehement, and"
1079,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",vociferous. The coalition was too unnatural. Johnson expected a
1080,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Maecenas, and was disappointed. No patronage, no assistance followed."
1081,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Visits were repeated; but the reception was not cordial. Johnson, one"
1082,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","day, was left a full hour, waiting in an antichamber, till a gentleman"
1083,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","should retire, and leave his lordship at leisure. This was the famous"
1084,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Colley Cibber. Johnson saw him go, and, fired with indignation, rushed"
1085,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",out of the house[l]. What lord Chesterfield thought of his visitor may
1086,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",be seen in a passage in one of that nobleman's letters to his son[m].
1087,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","""There is a man, whose moral character, deep learning, and superior"
1088,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","parts, I acknowledge, admire, and respect; but whom it is so impossible"
1089,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","for me to love, that I am almost in a fever, whenever I am in his"
1090,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",company. His figure (without being deformed) seems made to disgrace or
1091,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",ridicule the common structure of the human body. His legs and arms are
1092,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","never in the position which, according to the situation of his body,"
1093,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","they ought to be in, but constantly employed in committing acts of"
1094,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","hostility upon the graces. He throws any where, but down his throat,"
1095,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",whatever he means to drink; and mangles what he means to carve.
1096,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Inattentive to all the regards of social life, he mistimes and misplaces"
1097,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","every thing. He disputes with heat indiscriminately, mindless of the"
1098,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","rank, character, and situation of those with whom he disputes."
1099,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",Absolutely ignorant of the several gradations of familiarity and
1100,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","respect, he is exactly the same to his superiors, his equals, and his"
1101,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","inferiors; and, therefore, by a necessary consequence, is absurd to two"
1102,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",of the three. Is it possible to love such a man? No. The utmost I can do
1103,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","for him is, to consider him a respectable Hottentot."" Such was the idea"
1104,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","entertained by lord Chesterfield. After the incident of Colley Cibber,"
1105,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Johnson never repeated his visits. In his high and decisive tone, he has"
1106,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","been often heard to say, ""lord Chesterfield is a wit among lords, and a"
1107,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","lord among wits."""
1108,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
1109,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","In the course of the year 1747, Garrick, in conjunction with Lacy,"
1110,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","became patentee of Drury lane playhouse. For the opening of the theatre,"
1111,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","at the usual time, Johnson wrote, for his friend, the well-known"
1112,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","prologue, which, to say no more of it, may, at least, be placed on a"
1113,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",level with Pope's to the tragedy of Cato. The playhouse being now under
1114,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Garrick's direction, Johnson thought the opportunity fair to think of"
1115,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","his tragedy of Irene, which was his whole stock on his first arrival in"
1116,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","town, in the year 1737. That play was, accordingly, put into rehearsal"
1117,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","in January, 1749. As a precursor to prepare the way, and to awaken the"
1118,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","public attention, The Vanity of human Wishes, a poem in imitation of the"
1119,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","tenth satire of Juvenal, by the author of London, was published in the"
1120,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","same month. In the Gentleman's Magazine, for February, 1749, we find"
1121,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","that the tragedy of Irene was acted at Drury lane, on Monday, February"
1122,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the 6th, and, from that time, without interruption, to Monday, February"
1123,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the 20th, being in all thirteen nights. Since that time, it has not been"
1124,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",exhibited on any stage. Irene may be added to some other plays in our
1125,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","language, which have lost their place in the theatre, but continue to"
1126,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","please in the closet. During the representation of this piece, Johnson"
1127,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","attended every night behind the scenes. Conceiving that his character,"
1128,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","as an author, required some ornament for his person, he chose, upon that"
1129,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","occasion, to decorate himself with a handsome waistcoat, and a gold-laced"
1130,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","hat. The late Mr. Topham Beauclerc, who had a great deal of that"
1131,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","humour, which pleases the more for seeming undesigned, used to give a"
1132,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","pleasant description of this green-room finery, as related by the author"
1133,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","himself; ""But,"" said Johnson, with great gravity, ""I soon laid aside my"
1134,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","gold-laced hat, lest it should make me proud."" The amount of the three"
1135,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","benefit nights for the tragedy of Irene, it is to be feared, was not"
1136,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","very considerable, as the profit, that stimulating motive, never invited"
1137,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the author to another dramatic attempt. Some years afterwards, when the"
1138,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","present writer was intimate with Garrick, and knew Johnson to be in"
1139,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","distress, he asked the manager, why he did not produce another tragedy"
1140,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","for his Lichfield friend? Garrick's answer was remarkable: ""When Johnson"
1141,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","writes tragedy, 'declamation roars, and passion sleeps:' when"
1142,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Shakespeare wrote, he dipped his pen in his own heart."""
1143,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
1144,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","There may, perhaps, be a degree of sameness in this regular way of"
1145,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","tracing an author from one work to another, and the reader may feel the"
1146,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","effect of a tedious monotony; but, in the life of Johnson, there are no"
1147,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","other landmarks. He was now forty years old, and had mixed but little"
1148,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","with the world. He followed no profession, transacted no business, and"
1149,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",was a stranger to what is called a town life. We are now arrived at the
1150,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","brightest period, he had hitherto known. His name broke out upon mankind"
1151,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",with a degree of lustre that promised a triumph over all his
1152,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","difficulties. The life of Savage was admired, as a beautiful and"
1153,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",instructive piece of biography. The two imitations of Juvenal were
1154,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","thought to rival even the excellence of Pope; and the tragedy of Irene,"
1155,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","though uninteresting on the stage, was universally admired in the"
1156,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","closet, for the propriety of the sentiments, the richness of the"
1157,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","language, and the general harmony of the whole composition. His fame was"
1158,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",widely diffused; and he had made his agreement with the booksellers for
1159,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",his English dictionary at the sum of fifteen hundred guineas; a part of
1160,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","which was to be, from time to time, advanced, in proportion to the"
1161,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","progress of the work. This was a certain fund for his support, without"
1162,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",being obliged to write fugitive pieces for the petty supplies of the
1163,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","day. Accordingly we find that, in 1749, he established a club,"
1164,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","consisting of ten in number, at Horseman's, in Ivy lane, on every"
1165,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",Tuesday evening. This is the first scene of social life to which Johnson
1166,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","can be traced, out of his own house. The members of this little society"
1167,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","were, Samuel Johnson; Dr. Salter, father of the late master of the"
1168,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Charter house; Dr. Hawkesworth; Mr. Ryland, a merchant; Mr. Payne, a"
1169,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","bookseller, in Paternoster row; Mr. Samuel Dyer, a learned young man;"
1170,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Dr. William M'Ghie, a Scotch physician; Dr. Edmund Barker, a young"
1171,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","physician; Dr. Bathurst, another young physician; and sir John Hawkins."
1172,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","This list is given by sir John, as it should seem, with no other view"
1173,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",than to draw a spiteful and malevolent character of almost every one of
1174,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","them. Mr. Dyer, whom sir John says he loved with the affection of a"
1175,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","brother, meets with the harshest treatment, because it was his maxim,"
1176,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","that ""to live in peace with mankind, and in a temper to do good offices,"
1177,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","was the most essential part of our duty."" That notion of moral goodness"
1178,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","gave umbrage to sir John Hawkins, and drew down upon the memory of his"
1179,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","friend, the bitterest imputations. Mr. Dyer, however, was admired and"
1180,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",loved through life. He was a man of literature. Johnson loved to enter
1181,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","with him into a discussion of metaphysical, moral, and critical"
1182,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","subjects; in those conflicts, exercising his talents, and, according to"
1183,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","his custom, always contending for victory. Dr. Bathurst was the person"
1184,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",on whom Johnson fixed his affection. He hardly ever spoke of him without
1185,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","tears in his eyes. It was from him, who was a native of Jamaica, that"
1186,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Johnson received into his service Frank[n], the black servant, whom, on"
1187,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","account of his master, he valued to the end of his life. At the time of"
1188,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","instituting the club in Ivy lane, Johnson had projected the Rambler. The"
1189,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",title was most probably suggested by the Wanderer; a poem which he
1190,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","mentions, with the warmest praise, in the life of Savage. With the same"
1191,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","spirit of independence with which he wished to live, it was now his"
1192,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",pride to write. He communicated his plan to none of his friends: he
1193,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","desired no assistance, relying entirely on his own fund, and the"
1194,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","protection of the divine being, which he implored in a solemn form of"
1195,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","prayer, composed by himself for the occasion. Having formed a resolution"
1196,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","to undertake a work that might be of use and honour to his country, he"
1197,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","thought, with Milton, that this was not to be obtained ""but by devout"
1198,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","prayer to that eternal spirit, that can enrich with all utterance and"
1199,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","knowledge, and send out his seraphim with the hallowed fire of his"
1200,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","altar, to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleases."""
1201,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
1202,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Having invoked the special protection of heaven, and by that act of"
1203,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","piety fortified his mind, he began the great work of the Rambler. The"
1204,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","first number was published on Tuesday, March the 20th, 1750; and from"
1205,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","that time was continued regularly every Tuesday and Saturday, for the"
1206,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","space of two years, when it finally closed on Saturday, March 14, 1752."
1207,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","As it began with motives of piety, so it appears that the same religious"
1208,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","spirit glowed, with unabating ardour, to the last. His conclusion is:"
1209,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","""The essays professedly serious, if I have been able to execute my own"
1210,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","intentions, will be found exactly conformable to the precepts of"
1211,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","christianity, without any accommodation to the licentiousness and levity"
1212,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","of the present age. I, therefore, look back on this part of my work with"
1213,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","pleasure, which no man shall diminish or augment. I shall never envy the"
1214,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","honours which wit and learning obtain in any other cause, if I can be"
1215,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","numbered among the writers who have given ardour to virtue, and"
1216,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","confidence to truth."" The whole number of essays amounted to two hundred"
1217,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","and eight. Addison's, in the Spectator, are more in number, but not half"
1218,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",in point of quantity: Addison was not bound to publish on stated days;
1219,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","he could watch the ebb and flow of his genius, and send his paper to the"
1220,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","press, when his own taste was satisfied. Johnson's case was very"
1221,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",different. He wrote singly and alone. In the whole progress of the work
1222,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",he did not receive more than ten essays. This was a scanty contribution.
1223,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","For the rest, the author has described his situation: ""He that condemns"
1224,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","himself to compose on a stated day, will often bring to his task an"
1225,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","attention dissipated, a memory embarrassed, an imagination overwhelmed,"
1226,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","a mind distracted with anxieties, a body languishing with disease: he"
1227,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","will labour on a barren topick, till it is too late to change it; or, in"
1228,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the ardour of invention, diffuse his thoughts into wild exuberance,"
1229,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",which the pressing hour of publication cannot suffer judgment to examine
1230,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","or reduce."" Of this excellent production, the number sold on each day"
1231,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","did not amount to five hundred: of course, the bookseller, who paid the"
1232,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","author four guineas a week, did not carry on a successful trade. His"
1233,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","generosity and perseverance deserve to be commended; and happily, when"
1234,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the collection appeared in volumes, were amply rewarded. Johnson lived"
1235,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","to see his labours nourish in a tenth edition. His posterity, as an"
1236,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","ingenious French writer has said, on a similar occasion, began in his"
1237,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",life-time.
1238,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
1239,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","In the beginning of 1750, soon after the Rambler was set on foot,"
1240,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Johnson was induced, by the arts of a vile impostor, to lend his"
1241,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","assistance, during a temporary delusion, to a fraud not to be paralleled"
1242,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","in the annals of literature[o]. One Lauder, a native of Scotland, who"
1243,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","had been a teacher in the university of Edinburgh, had conceived a"
1244,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","mortal antipathy to the name and character of Milton. His reason was,"
1245,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","because the prayer of Pamela, in sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia, was, as he"
1246,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","supposed, maliciously inserted by the great poet in an edition of the"
1247,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Eikôn Basilike, in order to fix an imputation of impiety on the"
1248,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","memory of the murdered king. Fired with resentment, and willing to reap"
1249,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the profits of a gross imposition, this man collected, from several"
1250,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Latin poets, such as Masenius the jesuit, Staphorstius, a Dutch divine,"
1251,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Beza, and others, all such passages as bore any kind of resemblance to"
1252,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","different places in the Paradise Lost; and these he published, from time"
1253,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","to time, in the Gentleman's Magazine, with occasional interpolations of"
1254,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","lines, which he himself translated from Milton. The public credulity"
1255,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",swallowed all with eagerness; and Milton was supposed to be guilty of
1256,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","plagiarism from inferior modern writers. The fraud succeeded so well,"
1257,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","that Lauder collected the whole into a volume, and advertised it under"
1258,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the title of An Essay on Milton's Use and Imitation of the Moderns, in"
1259,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",his Paradise Lost; dedicated to the universities of Oxford and
1260,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Cambridge. While the book was in the press, the proof-sheets were shown"
1261,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","to Johnson, at the Ivy lane club, by Payne, the bookseller, who was one"
1262,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",of the members. No man in that society was in possession of the authors
1263,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",from whom Lauder professed to make his extracts. The charge was
1264,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","believed, and the contriver of it found his way to Johnson, who is"
1265,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","represented, by sir John Hawkins, not indeed as an accomplice in the"
1266,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","fraud, but, through motives of malignity to Milton, delighting in the"
1267,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","detection, and exulting that the poet's reputation would suffer by the"
1268,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",discovery. More malice to a deceased friend cannot well be imagined.
1269,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Hawkins adds, ""that he wished well to the argument must be inferred from"
1270,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the preface, which, indubitably, was written by him."" The preface, it is"
1271,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","well known, was written by Johnson, and for that reason is inserted in"
1272,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","this edition. But if Johnson approved of the argument, it was no longer"
1273,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",than while he believed it founded in truth. Let us advert to his own
1274,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","words in that very preface. ""Among the inquiries to which the ardour of"
1275,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","criticism has naturally given occasion, none is more obscure in itself,"
1276,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","or more worthy of rational curiosity, than a retrospection of the"
1277,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",progress of this mighty genius in the construction of his work; a view
1278,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","of the fabrick gradually rising, perhaps from small beginnings, till its"
1279,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","foundation rests in the centre, and its turrets sparkle in the skies; to"
1280,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","trace back the structure, through all its varieties, to the simplicity"
1281,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","of the first plan; to find what was projected, whence the scheme was"
1282,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","taken, how it was improved, by what assistance it was executed, and from"
1283,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",what stores the materials were collected; whether its founder dug them
1284,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","from the quarries of nature, or demolished other buildings to embellish"
1285,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","his own."" These were the motives that induced Johnson to assist Lauder"
1286,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",with a preface; and are not these the motives of a critic and a scholar?
1287,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","What reader of taste, what man of real knowledge, would not think his"
1288,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","time well employed in an enquiry so curious, so interesting, and"
1289,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","instructive? If Lauder's facts were really true, who would not be glad,"
1290,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","without the smallest tincture of malevolence, to receive real"
1291,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","information? It is painful to be thus obliged to vindicate a man who, in"
1292,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","his heart, towered above the petty arts of fraud and imposition, against"
1293,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","an injudicious biographer, who undertook to be his editor, and the"
1294,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","protector of his memory. Another writer, Dr. Towers, in an Essay on the"
1295,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Life and Character of Dr. Johnson, seems to countenance this calumny. He"
1296,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","says: ""It can hardly be doubted, but that Johnson's aversion to"
1297,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Milton's politics was the cause of that alacrity, with which he joined"
1298,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","with Lauder in his infamous attack on our great epic poet, and which"
1299,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","induced him to assist in that transaction."" These words would seem to"
1300,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","describe an accomplice, were they not immediately followed by an express"
1301,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","declaration, that Johnson was ""unacquainted with the imposture."" Dr."
1302,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Towers adds, ""It seems to have been, by way of making some compensation"
1303,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","to the memory of Milton, for the share he had in the attack of Lauder,"
1304,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","that Johnson wrote the prologue, spoken by Garrick, at Drury lane"
1305,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","theatre, 1750, on the performance of the Masque of Comus, for the"
1306,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","benefit of Milton's granddaughter."" Dr. Towers is not free from"
1307,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","prejudice; but, as Shakespeare has it, ""he begets a temperance, to give"
1308,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","it smoothness."" He is, therefore, entitled to a dispassionate answer."
1309,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","When Johnson wrote the prologue, it does appear that he was aware of the"
1310,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",malignant artifices practised by Lauder. In the postscript to Johnson's
1311,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","preface, a subscription is proposed, for relieving the granddaughter of"
1312,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the author of Paradise Lost. Dr. Towers will agree, that this shows"
1313,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Johnson's alacrity in doing good. That alacrity showed itself again, in"
1314,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the letter printed in the European Magazine, January, 1785, and there"
1315,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","said to have appeared originally in the General Advertiser, 4th April,"
1316,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","1750, by which the public were invited to embrace the opportunity of"
1317,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","paying a just regard to the illustrious dead, united with the pleasure"
1318,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","of doing good to the living. The letter adds, ""To assist industrious"
1319,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","indigence, struggling with distress, and debilitated by age, is a"
1320,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","display of virtue, and an acquisition of happiness and honour. Whoever,"
1321,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","therefore, would be thought capable of pleasure, in reading the works of"
1322,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","our incomparable Milton, and not so destitute of gratitude, as to refuse"
1323,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","to lay out a trifle, in a rational and elegant entertainment, for the"
1324,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","benefit of his living remains, for the exercise of their own virtue, the"
1325,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","increase of their reputation, and the consciousness of doing good,"
1326,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","should appear at Drury lane theatre, to-morrow, April 5, when Comus will"
1327,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","be performed, for the benefit of Mrs. Elizabeth Foster, granddaughter to"
1328,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the author, and the only surviving branch of his family. _Nota bene_,"
1329,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","there will be a new prologue on the occasion, written by the author of"
1330,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Irene, and spoken by Mr. Garrick."" The man, who had thus exerted himself"
1331,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","to serve the granddaughter, cannot be supposed to have entertained"
1332,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","personal malice to the grandfather. It is true, that the malevolence of"
1333,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Lauder, as well as the impostures of Archibald Bower, were fully"
1334,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","detected by the labours, in the cause of truth, of the reverend Dr."
1335,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Douglas, the late lord bishop of Salisbury,"
1336,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
1337,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","--""Diram qui contudit Hydram"
1338,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Notaque fatali portenta labore subegit."""
1339,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
1340,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","But the pamphlet, entitled, Milton vindicated from the Charge"
1341,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","of Plagiarism brought against him by Mr. Lauder, and Lauder himself"
1342,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","convicted of several forgeries, and gross impositions on the public, by"
1343,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","John Douglas, M.A. rector of Eaton Constantine, Salop, was not published"
1344,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","till the year 1751. In that work, p. 77, Dr. Douglas says, ""It is to be"
1345,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","hoped, nay, it is expected, that the elegant and nervous writer, whose"
1346,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","judicious sentiments, and inimitable style, point out the author of"
1347,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Lauder's preface and postcript, will no longer allow a man to plume"
1348,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","himself with his feathers, who appears so little to have deserved his"
1349,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","assistance; an assistance which, I am persuaded, would never have been"
1350,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","communicated, had there been the least suspicion of those facts, which I"
1351,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","have been the instrument of conveying to the world."" We have here a"
1352,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","contemporary testimony to the integrity of Dr. Johnson, throughout the"
1353,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",whole of that vile transaction. What was the consequence of the
1354,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","requisition made by Dr. Douglas? Johnson, whose ruling passion may be"
1355,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","said to be the love of truth, convinced Lauder, that it would be more"
1356,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","for his interest to make a full confession of his guilt, than to stand"
1357,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","forth the convicted champion of a lie; and, for this purpose, he drew"
1358,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","up, in the strongest terms, a recantation, in a letter to the reverend"
1359,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Mr. Douglas, which Lauder signed, and published in the year 1751. That"
1360,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","piece will remain a lasting memorial of the abhorrence, with which"
1361,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Johnson beheld a violation of truth. Mr. Nichols, whose attachment to"
1362,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","his illustrious friend was unwearied, showed him, in 1780, a book,"
1363,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",called Remarks on Johnson's Life of Milton; in which the affair of
1364,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",Lauder was renewed with virulence; and a poetical scale in the Literary
1365,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Magazine, 1758, (when Johnson had ceased to write in that collection,)"
1366,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",was urged as an additional proof of deliberate malice. He read the
1367,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","libellous passage with attention, and instantly wrote on the margin: ""In"
1368,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the business of Lauder I was deceived, partly by thinking the man too"
1369,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","frantick to be fraudulent. Of the poetical scale, quoted from the"
1370,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","magazine, I am not the author. I fancy it was put in after I had quitted"
1371,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","that work; for I not only did not write it, but I do not remember it."""
1372,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","As a critic and a scholar, Johnson was willing to receive what numbers,"
1373,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","at the time, believed to be true information: when he found that the"
1374,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","whole was a forgery, he renounced all connexion with the author."
1375,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",
1376,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","In March, 1752, he felt a severe stroke of affliction in the death of"
1377,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","his wife. The last number of the Rambler, as already mentioned, was on"
1378,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the 14th of that month. The loss of Mrs. Johnson was then approaching,"
1379,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","and, probably, was the cause that put an end to those admirable"
1380,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","periodical essays. It appears that she died on the 28th of March, in a"
1381,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","memorandum, at the foot of the Prayers and Meditations, that is called"
1382,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","her Dying Day. She was buried at Bromley, under the care of Dr."
1383,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Hawkesworth. Johnson placed a Latin inscription on her tomb, in which he"
1384,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",celebrated her beauty. With the singularity of his prayers for his
1385,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","deceased wife, from that time to the end of his days, the world is"
1386,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","sufficiently acquainted. On Easter day, 22nd April, 1764, his memorandum"
1387,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","says: ""Thought on Tetty, poor dear Tetty! with my eyes full. Went to"
1388,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",church. After sermon I recommended Tetty in a prayer by herself; and my
1389,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","father, mother, brother, and Bathurst, in another. I did it only once,"
1390,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","so far as it might be lawful for me."" In a prayer, January 23, 1759, the"
1391,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","day on which his mother was buried, he commends, as far as may be"
1392,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","lawful, her soul to God, imploring for her whatever is most beneficial"
1393,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",to her in her present state. In this habit he persevered to the end of
1394,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","his days. The reverend Mr. Strahan, the editor of the Prayers and"
1395,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Meditations, observes, ""that Johnson, on some occasions, prays that the"
1396,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",Almighty _may have had mercy_ on his wife and Mr. Thrale; evidently
1397,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",supposing their sentence to have been already passed in the divine mind;
1398,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","and, by consequence, proving, that he had no belief in a state of"
1399,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","purgatory, and no reason for praying for the dead that could impeach the"
1400,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","sincerity of his profession as a protestant."" Mr. Strahan adds, ""that,"
1401,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","in praying for the regretted tenants of the grave, Johnson conformed to"
1402,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",a practice which has been retained by many learned members of the
1403,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","established church, though the liturgy no longer admits it, if _where"
1404,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","the tree, falleth, there it shall be_; if our state, at the close of"
1405,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","life, is to be the measure of our final sentence, then prayers for the"
1406,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","dead, being visibly fruitless, can be regarded only as the vain"
1407,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","oblations of superstition. But of all superstitions this, perhaps, is"
1408,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","one of the least unamiable, and most incident to a good mind. If our"
1409,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","sensations of kindness be intense, those, whom we have revered and"
1410,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","loved, death cannot wholly seclude from our concern. It is true, for the"
1411,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","reason just mentioned, such evidences of our surviving affection may be"
1412,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","thought ill judged; but surely they are generous, and some natural"
1413,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","tenderness is due even to a superstition, which thus originates in piety"
1414,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","and benevolence."" These sentences, extracted from the reverend Mr."
1415,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","Strahan's preface, if they are not a full justification, are, at least,"
1416,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.",a beautiful apology. It will not be improper to add what Johnson himself
1417,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","has said on the subject. Being asked by Mr. Boswell[p], what he thought"
1418,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","of purgatory, as believed by the Roman catholicks? his answer was, ""It"
1419,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","is a very harmless doctrine. They are of opinion, that the generality of"
1420,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","mankind are neither so obstinately wicked, as to deserve everlasting"

1773,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
1774,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"In the margin of this letter, there is a memorandum in these words:"
1775,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"""March 16, 1756, sent six guineas. Witness, Wm. Richardson."" For the"
1776,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"honour of an admired writer it is to be regretted, that we do not find a"
1777,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"more liberal entry. To his friend, in distress, he sent eight shillings"
1778,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,more than was wanted. Had an incident of this kind occurred in one of
1779,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"his romances, Richardson would have known how to grace his hero; but in"
1780,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"fictitious scenes, generosity costs the writer nothing."
1781,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
1782,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,About this time Johnson contributed several papers to a periodical
1783,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"miscellany, called The Visiter, from motives which are highly honourable"
1784,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"to him, a compassionate regard for the late Mr. Christopher Smart. The"
1785,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,criticism on Pope's epitaphs appeared in that work. In a short time
1786,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"after, he became a reviewer in the Literary magazine, under the auspices"
1787,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"of the late Mr. Newbery, a man of a projecting head, good taste, and"
1788,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,great industry. This employment engrossed but little of Johnson's time.
1789,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"He resigned himself to indolence, took no exercise, rose about two, and"
1790,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"then received the visits of his friends. Authors, long since forgotten,"
1791,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"waited on him, as their oracle, and he gave responses in the chair of"
1792,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"criticism. He listened to the complaints, the schemes, and the hopes and"
1793,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"fears of a crowd of inferior writers, ""who,"" he said, in the words of"
1794,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Roger Ascham, ""lived _men knew not how, and died obscure, men marked not"
1795,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"when_."" He believed, that he could give a better history of Grub street"
1796,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,than any man living. His house was filled with a succession of visitors
1797,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,till four or five in the evening. During the whole time he presided at
1798,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"his tea-table. Tea was his favourite beverage; and, when the late Jonas"
1799,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Hanway pronounced his anathema against the use of tea, Johnson rose in"
1800,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"defence of his habitual practice, declaring himself ""in that article, a"
1801,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"hardened sinner, who had for years diluted his meals with the infusion"
1802,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"of that fascinating plant; whose tea-kettle had no time to cool; who,"
1803,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"with tea, solaced the midnight hour, and with tea welcomed the morning."""
1804,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
1805,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"The proposal for a new edition of Shakespeare, which had formerly"
1806,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"miscarried, was resumed in the year 1756. The booksellers readily agreed"
1807,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,to his terms: and subscription-tickets were issued out. For undertaking
1808,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"this work, money, he confessed, was the inciting motive. His friends"
1809,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"exerted themselves to promote his interest; and, in the mean time, he"
1810,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"engaged in a new periodical production, called The Idler. The first"
1811,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"number appeared on Saturday, April 15, 1758 and the last, April 5, 1760."
1812,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"The profits of this work, and the subscriptions for the new edition of"
1813,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Shakespeare, were the means by which he supported himself for four or"
1814,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"five years. In 1759, was published Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia. His"
1815,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"translation of Lobo's Voyage to Abissinia, seems to have pointed out"
1816,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"that country for the scene of action; and Rassela Christos, the general"
1817,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"of sultan Sequed, mentioned in that work, most probably suggested the"
1818,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,name of the prince. The author wanted to set out on a journey to
1819,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Lichfield, in order to pay the last offices of filial piety to his"
1820,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"mother, who, at the age of ninety, was then near her dissolution; but"
1821,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"money was necessary. Mr. Johnston, a bookseller, who has, long since,"
1822,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"left off business, gave one hundred pounds for the copy. With this"
1823,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,supply Johnson set out for Lichfield; but did not arrive in time to
1824,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"close the eyes of a parent whom he loved. He attended the funeral,"
1825,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"which, as appears among his memorandums, was on the 23rd of January,"
1826,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,1759.
1827,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
1828,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,Johnson now found it necessary to retrench his expenses. He gave up his
1829,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,house in Gough square. Mrs. Williams went into lodgings. He retired to
1830,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Gray's inn, and soon removed to chambers in the Inner Temple lane, where"
1831,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"he lived in poverty, total idleness, and the pride of literature: ""Magni"
1832,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"stat nominis umbra."" Mr. Fitzherbert, the father of lord St. Helens, the"
1833,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"present minister at Madrid, a man distinguished, through life, for his"
1834,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"benevolence and other amiable qualities, used to say, that he paid a"
1835,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"morning visit to Johnson, intending, from his chambers, to send a letter"
1836,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"into the city; but, to his great surprise, he found an author by"
1837,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"profession, without pen, ink, or paper. The present bishop of Salisbury"
1838,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"was also among those who endeavoured, by constant attention, to sooth"
1839,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"the cares of a mind, which he knew to be afflicted with gloomy"
1840,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"apprehensions. At one of the parties made at his house, Boscovich, the"
1841,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"jesuit, who had then lately introduced the Newtonian philosophy at Rome,"
1842,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"and, after publishing an elegant Latin poem on the subject, was made a"
1843,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"fellow of the Royal Society, was one of the company invited to meet Dr."
1844,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Johnson. The conversation, at first, was mostly in French. Johnson,"
1845,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"though thoroughly versed in that language, and a professed admirer of"
1846,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Boileau and La Bruyère, did not understand its pronunciation, nor"
1847,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,could he speak it himself with propriety. For the rest of the evening
1848,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,the talk was in Latin. Boscovich had a ready current flow of that flimsy
1849,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"phraseology, with which a priest may travel through Italy, Spain, and"
1850,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,Germany. Johnson scorned what he called colloquial barbarisms. It was
1851,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"his pride to speak his best. He went on, after a little practice, with"
1852,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,as much facility as if it was his native tongue. One sentence this
1853,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"writer well remembers. Observing that Fontenelle, at first, opposed the"
1854,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Newtonian philosophy, and embraced it afterwards, his words were:"
1855,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"""Fontinellus, ni fallor, in extrema senectute, fuit transfuga ad castra"
1856,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Newtoniana."""
1857,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
1858,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"We have now travelled through that part of Dr. Johnson's life, which was"
1859,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,a perpetual struggle with difficulties. Halcyon days are now to open
1860,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"upon him. In the month of May, 1762, his majesty, to reward literary"
1861,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"merit, signified his pleasure to grant to Johnson a pension of three"
1862,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"hundred pounds a year. The earl of Bute was minister. Lord Loughborough,"
1863,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"who, perhaps, was originally a mover in the business, had authority to"
1864,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"mention it. He was well acquainted with Johnson; but, having heard much"
1865,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"of his independent spirit, and of the downfal of Osborne, the"
1866,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"bookseller, he did not know but his benevolence might be rewarded with a"
1867,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,folio on his head. He desired the author of these memoirs to undertake
1868,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,the task. This writer thought the opportunity of doing so much good the
1869,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"most happy incident in his life. He went, without delay, to the"
1870,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"chambers, in the Inner Temple lane, which, in fact, were the abode of"
1871,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,wretchedness. By slow and studied approaches the message was disclosed.
1872,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,Johnson made a long pause: he asked if it was seriously intended: he
1873,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"fell into a profound meditation, and his own definition of a pensioner"
1874,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"occurred to him. He was told, ""that he, at least, did not come within"
1875,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"the definition."" He desired to meet next day, and dine at the Mitre"
1876,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,tavern. At that meeting he gave up all his scruples. On the following
1877,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"day, lord Loughborough conducted him to the earl of Bute. The"
1878,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"conversation that passed, was, in the evening, related to this writer,"
1879,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"by Dr. Johnson. He expressed his sense of his majesty's bounty, and"
1880,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"thought himself the more highly honoured, as the favour was not bestowed"
1881,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"on him for having dipped his pen in faction. ""No, sir,"" said lord Bute,"
1882,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"""it is not offered to you for having dipped your pen in faction, nor"
1883,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"with a design that you ever should."" Sir John Hawkins will have it,"
1884,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"that, after this interview, Johnson was often pressed to wait on lord"
1885,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Bute, but with a sullen spirit refused to comply. However that be,"
1886,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,Johnson was never heard to utter a disrespectful word of that nobleman.
1887,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"The writer of this essay remembers a circumstance, which may throw some"
1888,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"light on this subject. The late Dr. Rose, of Chiswick, whom Johnson"
1889,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"loved and respected, contended for the pre-eminence of the Scotch"
1890,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"writers; and Ferguson's book on Civil Society, then on the eve of"
1891,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"publication, he said, would give the laurel to North Britain. ""Alas!"
1892,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"what can he do upon that subject?"" said Johnson: ""Aristotle, Polybius,"
1893,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Grotius, Puffendorf, and Burlemaqui, have reaped in that field before"
1894,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"him."" ""He will treat it,"" said Dr. Rose, ""in a new manner."" ""A new"
1895,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"manner! Buckinger had no hands, and he wrote his name with his toes, at"
1896,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Charing Cross, for half a crown a piece; that was a new manner of"
1897,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"writing!"" Dr. Rose replied: ""If that will not satisfy you, I will name a"
1898,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"writer, whom you must allow to be the best in the kingdom."" ""Who is"
1899,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"that?"" ""The earl of Bute, when he wrote an order for your pension."""
1900,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"""There, sir,"" said Johnson, ""you have me in the toil: to lord Bute I"
1901,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"must allow whatever praise you claim for him."" Ingratitude was no part"
1902,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,of Johnson's character.
1903,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
1904,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Being now in the possession of a regular income, Johnson left his"
1905,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"chambers in the temple, and, once more, became master of a house in"
1906,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Johnson's court, Fleet street. Dr. Levet, his friend and physician in"
1907,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"ordinary[u], paid his daily visits, with assiduity; made tea all the"
1908,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"morning, talked what he had to say, and did not expect an answer. Mrs."
1909,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Williams had her apartment in the house, and entertained her benefactor"
1910,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,with more enlarged conversation. Chymistry was a part of Johnson's
1911,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"amusement. For this love of experimental philosophy, sir John Hawkins"
1912,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"thinks an apology necessary. He tells us, with great gravity, that"
1913,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,curiosity was the only object in view; not an intention to grow suddenly
1914,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"rich by the philosopher's stone, or the transmutation of metals. To"
1915,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"enlarge this circle, Johnson, once more, had recourse to a literary"
1916,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"club. This was at the Turk's head, in Gerard street, Soho, on every"
1917,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Tuesday evening through the year. The members were, besides himself, the"
1918,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"right honourable Edmund Burke, sir Joshua Reynolds, Dr. Nugent, Dr."
1919,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Goldsmith, the late Mr. Topham Beauclerc, Mr. Langton, Mr. Chamier, sir"
1920,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"J. Hawkins, and some others. Johnson's affection for sir Joshua was"
1921,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"founded on a long acquaintance, and a thorough knowledge of the virtuous"
1922,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,and amiable qualities of that excellent artist. He delighted in the
1923,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"conversation of Mr. Burke. He met him, for the first time, at Mr."
1924,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Garrick's, several years ago. On the next day he said: ""I suppose,"
1925,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Murphy, you are proud of your countryman: 'Cum talis sit, utinam noster"
1926,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"esset!'"" From that time, his constant observation was, ""that a man of"
1927,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"sense could not meet Mr. Burke, by accident, under a gateway, to avoid a"
1928,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"shower, without being convinced, that he was the first man in England."""
1929,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Johnson felt not only kindness, but zeal and ardour for his friends. He"
1930,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,did every thing in his power to advance the reputation of Dr. Goldsmith.
1931,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"He loved him, though he knew his failings, and particularly the leaven"
1932,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"of envy, which corroded the mind of that elegant writer, and made him"
1933,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"impatient, without disguise, of the praises bestowed on any person"
1934,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"whatever. Of this infirmity, which marked Goldsmith's character, Johnson"
1935,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,gave a remarkable instance. It happened that he went with sir Joshua
1936,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Reynolds and Goldsmith, to see the fantoccini, which were exhibited,"
1937,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"some years ago, in or near the Haymarket. They admired the curious"
1938,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"mechanism by which the puppets were made to walk the stage, draw a chair"
1939,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"to the table, sit down, write a letter, and perform a variety of other"
1940,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"actions, with such dexterity, that ""though nature's journeymen made the"
1941,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"men, they imitated humanity,"" to the astonishment of the spectator. The"
1942,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"entertainment being over, the three friends retired to a tavern. Johnson"
1943,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"and sir Joshua talked with pleasure of what they had seen; and, says"
1944,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Johnson, in a tone of admiration: ""How the little fellow brandished his"
1945,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"spontoon!"" ""There is nothing in it,"" replied Goldsmith, starting up with"
1946,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"impatience, ""give me a spontoon; I can do it as well myself."""
1947,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
1948,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Enjoying his amusements at his weekly club, and happy in a state of"
1949,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"independence, Johnson gained, in the year 1765, another resource, which"
1950,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"contributed, more than any thing else, to exempt him from the"
1951,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,solicitudes of life. He was introduced to the late Mr. Thrale and his
1952,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"family. Mrs. Piozzi has related the fact, and it is, therefore, needless"
1953,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,to repeat it in this place. The author of this narrative looks back to
1954,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"the share he had in that business, with self-congratulation, since he"
1955,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"knows the tenderness which, from that time, soothed Johnson's cares at"
1956,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Streatham, and prolonged a valuable life. The subscribers to Shakespeare"
1957,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,began to despair of ever seeing the promised edition. To acquit himself
1958,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"of this obligation, he went to work unwillingly, but proceeded with"
1959,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"vigour. In the month of October, 1765, Shakespeare was published; and,"
1960,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"in a short time after, the university of Dublin sent over a diploma, in"
1961,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"honourable terms, creating him a doctor of laws. Oxford, in eight or ten"
1962,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"years afterwards, followed the example; and, till then, Johnson never"
1963,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"assumed the title of doctor. In 1766, his constitution seemed to be in a"
1964,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"rapid decline; and that morbid melancholy, which often clouded his"
1965,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"understanding, came upon him with a deeper gloom than ever. Mr. and Mrs."
1966,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Thrale paid him a visit in this situation, and found him on his knees,"
1967,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"with Dr. Delap, the rector of Lewes, in Sussex, beseeching God to"
1968,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,continue to him the use of his understanding. Mr. Thrale took him to his
1969,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"house at Streatham, and Johnson, from that time, became a constant"
1970,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"resident in the family. He went, occasionally, to the club in Gerard"
1971,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"street, but his headquarters were fixed at Streatham. An apartment was"
1972,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"fitted up for him, and the library was greatly enlarged. Parties were"
1973,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,constantly invited from town; and Johnson was every day at an elegant
1974,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"table, with select and polished company. Whatever could be devised by"
1975,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Mr. and Mrs. Thrale to promote the happiness, and establish the health"
1976,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"of their guest, was studiously performed from that time to the end of"
1977,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Mr. Thrale's life. Johnson accompanied the family, in all their summer"
1978,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"excursions, to Brighthelmstone, to Wales, and to Paris. It is but"
1979,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"justice to Mr. Thrale to say, that a more ingenuous frame of mind no man"
1980,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,possessed. His education at Oxford gave him the habits of a gentleman;
1981,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,his amiable temper recommended his conversation; and the goodness of his
1982,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"heart made him a sincere friend. That he was the patron of Johnson, is"
1983,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,an honour to his memory.
1984,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
1985,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"In petty disputes with contemporary writers, or the wits of the age,"
1986,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,Johnson was seldom entangled. A single incident of that kind may not be
1987,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"unworthy of notice, since it happened with a man of great celebrity in"
1988,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,his time. A number of friends dined with Garrick on a Christmas day.
1989,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Foote was then in Ireland. It was said, at table, that the modern"
1990,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,Aristophanes (so Foote was called) had been horsewhipped by a Dublin
1991,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"apothecary, for mimicking him on the stage. ""I wonder,"" said Garrick,"
1992,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"""that any man should show so much resentment to Foote; he has a patent"
1993,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,for such liberties; nobody ever thought it worth his while to quarrel
1994,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"with him in London."" ""I am glad,"" said Johnson, ""to find that the man is"
1995,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"rising in the world."" The expression was afterwards repeated to Foote,"
1996,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"who, in return, gave out, that he would produce the Caliban of"
1997,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"literature on the stage. Being informed of this design, Johnson sent"
1998,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"word to Foote: ""that the theatre being intended for the reformation of"
1999,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"vice, he would step from the boxes on the stage, and correct him before"
2000,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"the audience."" Foote knew the intrepidity of his antagonist, and"
2001,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"abandoned the design. No ill will ensued. Johnson used to say: ""that for"
2002,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"broad-faced mirth, Foote had not his equal."""
2003,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2004,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,Dr. Johnson's fame excited the curiosity of the king. His majesty
2005,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,expressed a desire to see a man of whom extraordinary things were said.
2006,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Accordingly, the librarian at Buckingham house invited Johnson to see"
2007,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"that elegant collection of books, at the same time giving a hint of what"
2008,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"was intended. His majesty entered the room, and, among other things,"
2009,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"asked the author, ""if he meant to give the world any more of his"
2010,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"compositions."" Johnson answered: ""that he thought he had written"
2011,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"enough."" ""And I should think so too,"" replied his majesty, ""if you had"
2012,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"not written so well."""
2013,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2014,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Though Johnson thought he had written enough, his genius, even in spite"
2015,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"of bodily sluggishness, could not lie still. In 1770 we find him"
2016,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"entering the lists, as a political writer. The flame of discord that"
2017,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"blazed throughout the nation, on the expulsion of Mr. Wilkes, and the"
2018,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"final determination of the house of commons, that Mr. Luttrell was duly"
2019,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"elected by two hundred and six votes, against eleven hundred and"
2020,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"forty-three, spread a general spirit of discontent. To allay the tumult,"
2021,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Dr. Johnson published the False Alarm. Mrs. Piozzi informs us, ""that this"
2022,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"pamphlet was written at her house, between eight o'clock on Wednesday"
2023,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"night and twelve on Thursday night."" This celerity has appeared"
2024,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"wonderful to many, and some have doubted the truth. It may, however, be"
2025,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"placed within the bounds of probability. Johnson has observed, that"
2026,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,there are different methods of composition. Virgil was used to pour out
2027,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"a great number of verses in the morning, and pass the day in retrenching"
2028,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"the exuberances, and correcting inaccuracies; and it was Pope's custom"
2029,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"to write his first thoughts in his first words, and gradually to"
2030,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"amplify, decorate, rectify, and refine them. Others employ, at once,"
2031,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"memory and invention, and, with little intermediate use of the pen, form"
2032,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"and polish large masses by continued meditation, and write their"
2033,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"productions only, when, in their opinion, they have completed them. This"
2034,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,last was Johnson's method. He never took his pen in hand till he had
2035,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"well weighed his subject, and grasped, in his mind, the sentiments, the"
2036,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"train of argument, and the arrangement of the whole. As he often thought"
2037,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"aloud, he had, perhaps, talked it over to himself. This may account for"
2038,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"that rapidity with which, in general, he despatched his sheets to the"
2039,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"press, without being at the trouble of a fair copy. Whatever may be the"
2040,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"logic or eloquence of the False Alarm, the house of commons have since"
2041,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,erased the resolution from the journals. But whether they have not left
2042,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,materials for a future controversy may be made a question.
2043,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2044,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"In 1771, he published another tract, on the subject of Falkland islands."
2045,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,The design was to show the impropriety of going to war with Spain for an
2046,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"island, thrown aside from human use, stormy in winter, and barren in"
2047,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"summer. For this work it is apparent, that materials were furnished by"
2048,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,direction of the minister.
2049,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2050,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"At the approach of the general election in 1774, he wrote a short"
2051,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"discourse, called The Patriot, not with any visible application to Mr."
2052,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Wilkes; but to teach the people to reject the leaders of opposition, who"
2053,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"called themselves patriots. In 1775, he undertook a pamphlet of more"
2054,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"importance, namely, Taxation no Tyranny, in answer to the Resolutions"
2055,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"and Address of the American congress. The scope of the argument was,"
2056,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"that distant colonies, which had, in their assemblies, a legislature of"
2057,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"their own, were, notwithstanding, liable to be taxed in a British"
2058,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"parliament, where they had neither peers in one house, nor"
2059,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"representatives in the other. He was of opinion, that this country was"
2060,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"strong enough to enforce obedience. ""When an Englishman,"" he says, ""is"
2061,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"told that the Americans shoot up like the hydra, he naturally considers"
2062,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"how the hydra was destroyed."" The event has shown how much he and the"
2063,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,minister of that day were mistaken.
2064,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2065,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"The account of the Tour to the Western Islands of Scotland, which was"
2066,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"undertaken in the autumn of 1773, in company with Mr. Boswell, was not"
2067,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,published till some time in the year 1775. This book has been variously
2068,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"received; by some extolled for the elegance of the narrative, and the"
2069,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"depth of observation on life and manners; by others, as much condemned,"
2070,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"as a work of avowed hostility to the Scotch nation. The praise was,"
2071,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"beyond all question, fairly deserved; and the censure, on due"
2072,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"examination, will appear hasty and ill founded. That Johnson entertained"
2073,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"some prejudices against the Scotch must not be dissembled. It is true,"
2074,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"as Mr. Boswell says, ""that he thought their success in England exceeded"
2075,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"their proportion of real merit, and he could not but see in them that"
2076,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"nationality which no liberal-minded Scotsman will deny."" The author of"
2077,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"these memoirs well remembers, that Johnson one day asked him, ""have you"
2078,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,observed the difference between your own country impudence and Scotch
2079,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"impudence?"" The answer being in the negative: ""then I will tell you,"""
2080,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"said Johnson. ""The impudence of an Irishman is the impudence of a fly,"
2081,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"that buzzes about you, and you put it away, but it returns again, and"
2082,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,flutters and teases you. The impudence of a Scotsman is the impudence of
2083,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"a leech, that fixes and sucks your blood."" Upon another occasion, this"
2084,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"writer went with him into the shop of Davies, the bookseller, in Russell"
2085,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"street, Covent garden. Davies came running to him, almost out of breath"
2086,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"with joy: ""The Scots gentleman is come, sir; his principal wish is to"
2087,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"see you; he is now in the back parlour."" ""Well, well, I'll see the"
2088,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"gentleman,"" said Johnson. He walked towards the room. Mr. Boswell was"
2089,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"the person. This writer followed, with no small curiosity. ""I find,"""
2090,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"said Mr. Boswell, ""that I am come to London, at a bad time, when great"
2091,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"popular prejudice has gone forth against us North Britons; but, when I"
2092,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"am talking to you, I am talking to a large and liberal mind, and you"
2093,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"know that I cannot help coming from Scotland."" ""Sir,"" said Johnson, ""no"
2094,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"more can the rest of your countrymen[x]."""
2095,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2096,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,He had other reasons that helped to alienate him from the natives of
2097,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,Scotland. Being a cordial well-wisher to the constitution in church and
2098,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"state, he did not think that Calvin and John Knox were proper founders"
2099,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"of a national religion. He made, however, a wide distinction between the"
2100,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,dissenters of Scotland and the separatists of England. To the former he
2101,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"imputed no disaffection, no want of loyalty. Their soldiers and their"
2102,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,officers had shed their blood with zeal and courage in the service of
2103,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"great Britain; and the people, he used to say, were content with their"
2104,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"own established modes of worship, without wishing, in the present age,"
2105,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,to give any disturbance to the church of England.
2106,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2107,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"This he was, at all times, ready to admit; and, therefore, declared,"
2108,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"that, whenever he found a Scotchman, to whom an Englishman was as a"
2109,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Scotchman, that Scotchman should be as an Englishman to him. In this,"
2110,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"surely, there was no rancour, no malevolence. The dissenters, on this"
2111,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"side the Tweed, appeared to him in a different light. Their religion, he"
2112,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"frequently said, was too worldly, too political, too restless and"
2113,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"ambitious. The doctrine of cashiering kings, and erecting, on the ruins"
2114,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"of the constitution, a new form of government, which lately issued from"
2115,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"their pulpits, he always thought was, under a calm disguise, the"
2116,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"principle that lay lurking in their hearts. He knew, that a wild"
2117,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"democracy had overturned kings, lords, and commons; and that a set of"
2118,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"republican fanatics, who would not bow at the name of Jesus, had taken"
2119,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"possession of all the livings, and all the parishes in the kingdom. That"
2120,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"those scenes of horror might never be renewed, was the ardent wish of"
2121,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Dr. Johnson; and, though he apprehended no danger from Scotland, it is"
2122,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"probable, that his dislike of calvinism mingled, sometimes, with his"
2123,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,reflections on the natives of that country. The association of ideas
2124,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"could not be easily broken; but it is well known, that he loved and"
2125,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,respected many gentlemen from that part of the island. Dr. Robertson's
2126,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"History of Scotland, and Dr. Beattie's Essays, were subjects of his"
2127,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"constant praise. Mr. Boswell, Dr. Rose, of Chiswick, Andrew Millar, Mr."
2128,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Hamilton, the printer, and the late Mr. Strahan, were among his most"
2129,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,intimate friends. Many others might be added to the list. He scorned to
2130,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"enter Scotland as a spy; though Hawkins, his biographer, and the"
2131,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"professing defender of his fame, allowed himself leave to represent him"
2132,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,in that ignoble character. He went into Scotland to survey men and
2133,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"manners. Antiquities, fossils, and minerals, were not within his"
2134,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,province. He did not visit that country to settle the station of Roman
2135,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"camps, or the spot, where Galgacus fought the last battle for public"
2136,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"liberty. The people, their customs, and the progress of literature, were"
2137,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"his objects. The civilities which he received in the course of his tour,"
2138,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"have been repaid with grateful acknowledgment, and, generally, with"
2139,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"great elegance of expression. His crime is, that he found the country"
2140,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"bare of trees, and he has stated the fact. This, Mr. Boswell, in his"
2141,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"tour to the Hebrides, has told us, was resented, by his countrymen, with"
2142,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,anger inflamed to rancour; but he admits that there are few trees on the
2143,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"east side of Scotland. Mr. Pennant, in his tour, says, that, in some"
2144,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"parts of the eastern side of the country, he saw several large"
2145,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"plantations of pine, planted by gentlemen near their seats; and, in this"
2146,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"respect, such a laudable spirit prevails, that, in another half-century,"
2147,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"it never shall be said, ""To spy the nakedness of the land are you come."""
2148,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Johnson could not wait for that half-century, and, therefore, mentioned"
2149,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"things as he found them. If, in any thing, he has been mistaken, he has"
2150,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"made a fair apology, in the last paragraph of his book, avowing with"
2151,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"candour: ""That he may have been surprised by modes of life, and"
2152,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"appearances of nature, that are familiar to men of wider survey, and"
2153,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,more varied conversation. Novelty and ignorance must always be
2154,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"reciprocal: and he is conscious that his thoughts on national manners,"
2155,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"are the thoughts of one who has seen but little."""
2156,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2157,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"The poems of Ossian made a part of Johnson's inquiry, during his"
2158,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"residence in Scotland and the Hebrides. On his return to England,"
2159,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"November, 1773, a storm seemed to be gathering over his head; but the"
2160,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"cloud never burst, and the thunder never fell.--Ossian, it is well"
2161,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"known, was presented to the public, as a translation from the Erse; but"
2162,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"that this was a fraud, Johnson declared, without hesitation. ""The Erse,"""
2163,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"he says, ""was always oral only, and never a written language. The Welsh"
2164,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"and the Irish were more cultivated. In Erse, there was not in the world"
2165,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"a single manuscript a hundred years old. Martin, who, in the last"
2166,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"century, published an account of the Western Islands, mentions Irish,"
2167,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"but never Erse manuscripts, to be found in the islands in his time. The"
2168,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"bards could not read; if they could, they might, probably, have written."
2169,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"But the bard was a barbarian among barbarians, and, knowing nothing"
2170,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"himself, lived with others that knew no more. If there is a manuscript"
2171,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"from which the translation was made, in what age was it written, and"
2172,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"where is it? If it was collected from oral recitation, it could only be"
2173,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"in detached parts, and scattered fragments: the whole is too long to be"
2174,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"remembered. Who put it together in its present form?"" For these, and"
2175,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"such like reasons, Johnson calls the whole an imposture. He adds, ""The"
2176,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"editor, or author, never could show the original, nor can it be shown by"
2177,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"any other. To revenge reasonable incredulity, by refusing evidence, is a"
2178,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,degree of insolence with which the world is not yet acquainted; and
2179,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"stubborn audacity is the last refuge of guilt."" This reasoning carries"
2180,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,with it great weight. It roused the resentment of Mr. Macpherson. He
2181,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,sent a threatening letter to the author; and Johnson answered him in the
2182,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"rough phrase of stern defiance. The two heroes frowned at a distance,"
2183,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,but never came to action.
2184,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2185,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"In the year 1777, the misfortunes of Dr. Dodd excited his compassion. He"
2186,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"wrote a speech for that unhappy man, when called up to receive judgment"
2187,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"of death; besides two petitions, one to the king, and another to the"
2188,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,queen; and a sermon to be preached by Dodd to the convicts in Newgate.
2189,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"It may appear trifling to add, that, about the same time, he wrote a"
2190,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"prologue to the comedy of a Word to the Wise, written by Hugh Kelly. The"
2191,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"play, some years before, had been damned by a party on the first night."
2192,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,It was revived for the benefit of the author's widow. Mrs. Piozzi
2193,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"relates, that when Johnson was rallied for these exertions, so close to"
2194,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"one another, his answer was, ""When they come to me with a dying parson,"
2195,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"and a dead stay-maker, what can a man do?"""
2196,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2197,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,We come now to the last of his literary labours. At the request of the
2198,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"booksellers, he undertook the Lives of the Poets. The first publication"
2199,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"was in 1779, and the whole was completed in 1781. In a memorandum of"
2200,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"that year, he says, some time in March he finished the Lives of the"
2201,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Poets, which he wrote in his usual way, dilatorily and hastily,"
2202,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"unwilling to work, yet working with vigour and haste. In another place,"
2203,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"he hopes they are written in such a manner, as may tend to the promotion"
2204,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"of piety. That the history of so many men, who, in their different"
2205,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"degrees, made themselves conspicuous in their time, was not written"
2206,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"recently after their deaths, seems to be an omission that does no honour"
2207,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"to the republic of letters. Their contemporaries, in general, looked on"
2208,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"with calm indifference, and suffered wit and genius to vanish out of the"
2209,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"world in total silence, unregarded and unlamented. Was there no friend"
2210,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,to pay the tribute of a tear? No just observer of life to record the
2211,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,virtues of the deceased? Was even envy silent? It seemed to have been
2212,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"agreed, that if an author's works survived, the history of the man was"
2213,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,to give no moral lesson to after-ages. If tradition told us that Ben
2214,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Jonson went to the Devil tavern; that Shakespeare stole deer, and held"
2215,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,the stirrup at play-house doors; that Dryden frequented Button's
2216,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"coffee-house; curiosity was lulled asleep, and biography forgot the best"
2217,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"part of her function, which is, to instruct mankind by examples taken from"
2218,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"the school of life. This task remained for Dr. Johnson, when years had"
2219,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"rolled away; when the channels of information were, for the most part,"
2220,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"choked up, and little remained besides doubtful anecdote, uncertain"
2221,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"tradition, and vague report."
2222,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2223,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"""Nunc situs informis premit et deserta vetustas."""
2224,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2225,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"The value of biography has been better understood in other ages, and in"
2226,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"other countries. Tacitus informs us, that to record the lives and"
2227,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"characters of illustrious men, was the practice of the Roman authors, in"
2228,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"the early periods of the republic. In France, the example has been"
2229,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"followed. Fontenelle, D'Alembert, and monsieur Thomas, have left models"
2230,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,in this kind of composition. They have embalmed the dead. But it is
2231,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"true, that they had incitements and advantages, even at a distant day,"
2232,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"which could not, by any diligence, be obtained by Dr. Johnson. The wits"
2233,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"of France had ample materials. They lived in a nation of critics, who"
2234,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"had, at heart, the honour done to their country by their poets, their"
2235,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"heroes, and their philosophers. They had, besides, an academy of"
2236,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"belles-lettres, where genius was cultivated, refined, and encouraged."
2237,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"They had the tracts, the essays, and dissertations, which remain in the"
2238,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"memoirs of the academy, and they had the speeches of the several members,"
2239,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,delivered at their first admission to a seat in that learned assembly.
2240,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,In those speeches the new academician did ample justice to the memory of
2241,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,his predecessor; and though his harangue was decorated with the colours
2242,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"of eloquence, and was, for that reason, called panegyric, yet, being"
2243,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"pronounced before qualified judges, who knew the talents, the conduct,"
2244,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"and morals of the deceased, the speaker could not, with propriety,"
2245,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"wander into the regions of fiction. The truth was known, before it was"
2246,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,adorned. The academy saw the marble before the artist polished it. But
2247,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"this country has had no academy of literature. The public mind, for"
2248,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"centuries, has been engrossed by party and faction; ""by the madness of"
2249,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"many for the gain of a few;"" by civil wars, religious dissensions, trade"
2250,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"and commerce, and the arts of accumulating wealth. Amidst such"
2251,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"attentions, who can wonder that cold praise has been often the only"
2252,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"reward of merit? In this country, Dr. Nathaniel Hodges, who, like the"
2253,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"good bishop of Marseilles, drew purer breath amidst the contagion of the"
2254,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"plague in London, and, during the whole time, continued in the city,"
2255,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"administering medical assistance, was suffered, as Johnson used to"
2256,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"relate, with tears in his eyes, to die for debt, in a gaol. In this"
2257,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"country, the man who brought the New river to London, was ruined by that"
2258,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"noble project; and, in this country, Otway died for want, on Tower hill;"
2259,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Butler, the great author of Hudibras, whose name can only die with the"
2260,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"English language, was left to languish in poverty; the particulars of"
2261,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"his life almost unknown, and scarce a vestige of him left, except his"
2262,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"immortal poem. Had there been an academy of literature, the lives, at"
2263,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"least, of those celebrated persons, would have been written for the"
2264,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"benefit of posterity. Swift, it seems, had the idea of such an"
2265,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"institution, and proposed it to lord Oxford; but whig and tory were more"
2266,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"important objects. It is needless to dissemble, that Dr. Johnson, in the"
2267,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"life of Roscommon, talks of the inutility of such a project. ""In this"
2268,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"country,"" he says, ""an academy could be expected to do but little. If an"
2269,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"academician's place were profitable, it would be given by interest; if"
2270,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"attendance were gratuitous, it would be rarely paid, and no man would"
2271,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"endure the least disgust. Unanimity is impossible, and debate would"
2272,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"separate the assembly."" To this it may be sufficient to answer, that the"
2273,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,Royal society has not been dissolved by sullen disgust; and the modern
2274,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"academy, at Somerset house, has already performed much, and promises"
2275,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"more. Unanimity is not necessary to such an assembly. On the contrary,"
2276,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"by difference of opinion, and collision of sentiment, the cause of"
2277,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"literature would thrive and flourish. The true principles of criticism,"
2278,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"the secret of fine writing, the investigation of antiquities, and other"
2279,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"interesting subjects, might occasion a clash of opinions; but, in that"
2280,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"contention, truth would receive illustration, and the essays of the"
2281,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"several members would supply the memoirs of the academy. ""But,"" says Dr."
2282,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Johnson, ""suppose the philological decree made and promulgated, what"
2283,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"would be its authority? In absolute government there is, sometimes, a"
2284,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,general reverence paid to all that has the sanction of power the
2285,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"countenance of greatness.--How little this is the state of our country,"
2286,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"needs not to be told. The edicts of an English academy would, probably,"
2287,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"be read by many, only that they may be sure to disobey them. The present"
2288,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"manners of the nation would deride authority, and, therefore, nothing is"
2289,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"left, but that every writer should criticise himself."" This, surely, is"
2290,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"not conclusive. It is by the standard of the best writers, that every"
2291,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"man settles, for himself, his plan of legitimate composition; and since"
2292,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"the authority of superior genius is acknowledged, that authority, which"
2293,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"the individual obtains, would not be lessened by an association with"
2294,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"others of distinguished ability. It may, therefore, be inferred, that an"
2295,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"academy of literature would be an establishment highly useful, and an"
2296,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"honour to literature. In such an institution, profitable places would"
2297,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"not be wanted. ""Vatis avarus haud facile est animus;"" and the minister,"
2298,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"who shall find leisure, from party and faction, to carry such a scheme"
2299,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"into execution, will, in all probability, be respected by posterity, as"
2300,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,the Maecenas of letters.
2301,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2302,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"We now take leave of Dr. Johnson, as an author. Four volumes of his"
2303,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Lives of the Poets were published in 1778, and the work was completed in"
2304,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"1781. Should biography fall again into disuse, there will not always be"
2305,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"a Johnson to look back through a century, and give a body of critical"
2306,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"and moral instruction. In April, 1781, he lost his friend Mr. Thrale."
2307,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"His own words, in his diary, will best tell that melancholy event. ""On"
2308,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Wednesday, the 11th of April, was buried my dear friend Mr. Thrale, who"
2309,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"died on Wednesday, the 4th, and with him were buried many of my hopes"
2310,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"and pleasures. About five, I think, on Wednesday morning, he expired. I"
2311,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"felt almost the last flutter of his pulse, and looked, for the last"
2312,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"time, upon the face, that, for fifteen years before, had never been"
2313,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"turned upon me but with respect and benignity. Farewell: may God, that"
2314,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"delighteth in mercy, have had mercy on thee! I had constantly prayed for"
2315,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"him before his death. The decease of him, from whose friendship I had"
2316,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"obtained many opportunities of amusement, and to whom I turned my"
2317,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"thoughts, as to a refuge from misfortunes, has left me heavy. But my"
2318,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"business is with myself.""--From the close of his last work, the malady"
2319,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"that persecuted him through life came upon him with alarming severity,"
2320,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"and his constitution declined apace. In 1782, his old friend, Levet,"
2321,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"expired, without warning and without a groan. Events like these reminded"
2322,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Johnson of his own mortality. He continued his visits to Mrs. Thrale, at"
2323,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Streatham, to the 7th day of October, 1782, when, having first composed"
2324,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"a prayer for the happiness of a family, with whom he had, for many"
2325,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"years, enjoyed the pleasures and comforts of life, he removed to his own"
2326,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"house in town. He says he was up early in the morning, and read"
2327,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"fortuitously in the Gospel, ""which was his parting use of the library."""
2328,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"The merit of the family is manifested by the sense he had of it, and we"
2329,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,see his heart overflowing with gratitude. He leaves the place with
2330,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"regret, and ""casts a lingering look behind."""
2331,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2332,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,The few remaining occurrences may be soon despatched. In the month of
2333,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"June, 1783, Johnson had a paralytic stroke, which affected his speech"
2334,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"only. He wrote to Dr. Taylor, of Westminster; and to his friend Mr."
2335,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Allen, the printer, who lived at the next door. Dr. Brocklesby arrived"
2336,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"in a short time, and by his care, and that of Dr. Heberden, Johnson soon"
2337,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"recovered. During his illness, the writer of this narrative visited him,"
2338,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,and found him reading Dr. Watson's Chymistry. Articulating with
2339,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"difficulty, he said, ""From this book, he who knows nothing may learn a"
2340,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"great deal; and he who knows, will be pleased to find his knowledge"
2341,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"recalled to his mind in a manner highly pleasing."" In the month of"
2342,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"August he set out for Lichfield, on a visit to Mrs. Lucy Porter, the"
2343,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"daughter of his wife by her first husband; and, in his way back, paid"
2344,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"his respects to Dr. Adams, at Oxford. Mrs. Williams died, at his house"
2345,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"in Bolt court, in the month of September, during his absence. This was"
2346,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"another shock to a mind like his, ever agitated by the thoughts of"
2347,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,futurity. The contemplation of his own approaching end was constantly
2348,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"before his eyes; and the prospect of death, he declared, was terrible."
2349,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"For many years, when he was not disposed to enter into the conversation"
2350,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"going forward, whoever sat near his chair, might hear him repeating,"
2351,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"from Shakespeare,"
2352,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2353,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"""Aye, but to die, and go we know not where;"
2354,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
2355,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,This sensible warm motion to become
2356,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"A kneaded clod, and the delighted spirit"
2357,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"To bathe in fiery floods""--"
2358,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2359,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"And from Milton,"
2360,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2361,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"--""Who would lose,"
2362,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"For fear of pain, this intellectual being?"""
2363,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2364,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"By the death of Mrs. Williams he was left in a state of destitution,"
2365,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"with nobody but Frank, his black servant, to sooth his anxious moments."
2366,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"In November, 1783, he was swelled from head to foot with a dropsy. Dr."
2367,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Brocklesby, with that benevolence with which he always assists his"
2368,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"friends, paid his visits with assiduity. The medicines prescribed were"
2369,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"so efficacious, that, in a few days, Johnson, while he was offering up"
2370,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"his prayers, was suddenly obliged to rise, and, in the course of the"
2371,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"day, discharged twenty pints of water."
2372,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2373,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Johnson, being eased of his dropsy, began to entertain hopes that the"
2374,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,vigour of his constitution was not entirely broken. For the sake of
2375,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"conversing with his friends, he established a conversation club, to meet"
2376,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"on every Wednesday evening; and, to serve a man whom he had known in Mr."
2377,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Thrale's household for many years, the place was fixed at his house, in"
2378,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Essex street, near the Temple. To answer the malignant remarks of sir"
2379,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"John Hawkins, on this subject, were a wretched waste of time. Professing"
2380,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"to be Johnson's friend, that biographer has raised more objections to"
2381,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"his character, than all the enemies to that excellent man. Sir John had"
2382,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"a root of bitterness that ""put rancours in the vessel of his peace."""
2383,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Fielding, he says, was the inventor of a cant phrase, ""Goodness of"
2384,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"heart, which means little more than the virtue of a horse or a dog."" He"
2385,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"should have known, that kind affections are the essence of virtue: they"
2386,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"are the will of God implanted in our nature, to aid and strengthen moral"
2387,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,obligation; they incite to action: a sense of benevolence is no less
2388,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"necessary than a sense of duty. Good affections are an ornament, not"
2389,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"only to an author, but to his writings. He who shows himself upon a cold"
2390,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,scent for opportunities to bark and snarl throughout a volume of six
2391,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"hundred pages, may, if he will, pretend to moralise; but goodness of"
2392,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"heart, or, to use that politer phrase, ""the virtue of a horse or a dog,"""
2393,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,would redound more to his honour. But sir John is no more: our business
2394,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,is with Johnson. The members of his club were respectable for their
2395,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"rank, their talents, and their literature. They attended with"
2396,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"punctuality, till about Midsummer, 1784, when, with some appearance of"
2397,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"health, Johnson went into Derbyshire, and thence to Lichfield. While he"
2398,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"was in that part of the world, his friends, in town, were labouring for"
2399,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"his benefit. The air of a more southern climate, they thought, might"
2400,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,prolong a valuable life. But a pension of three hundred pounds a year
2401,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"was a slender fund for a travelling valetudinarian, and it was not then"
2402,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,known that he had saved a moderate sum of money. Mr. Boswell and sir
2403,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,Joshua Reynolds undertook to solicit the patronage of the chancellor.
2404,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"With lord Thurlow, while he was at the bar, Johnson was well acquainted."
2405,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"He was often heard to say, ""Thurlow is a man of such vigour of mind,"
2406,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"that I never knew I was to meet him, but--I was going to say, I was"
2407,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"afraid, but that would not be true, for I never was afraid of any man;"
2408,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"but I never knew that I was to meet Thurlow, but I knew I had something"
2409,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"to encounter."" The chancellor undertook to recommend Johnson's case; but"
2410,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"without success. To protract, if possible, the days of a man, whom he"
2411,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"respected, he offered to advance the sum of five hundred pounds. Being"
2412,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"informed of this at Lichfield, Johnson wrote the following letter:"
2413,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2414,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"""MY LORD,--After a long, and not inattentive observation of mankind,"
2415,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,the generosity of your lordship's offer raises in me not less wonder
2416,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"than gratitude. Bounty, so liberally bestowed, I should gladly"
2417,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"receive, if my condition made it necessary; for to such a mind who"
2418,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,would not be proud to own his obligations? But it has pleased God to
2419,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"restore me to so great a measure of health, that, if I should now"
2420,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"appropriate so much of a fortune destined to do good, I could not"
2421,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,escape from myself the charge of advancing a false claim. My journey
2422,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"to the continent, though I once thought it necessary, was never much"
2423,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,encouraged by my physicians; and I was very desirous that your
2424,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"lordship should be told it, by sir Joshua Reynolds, as an event very"
2425,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"uncertain; for, if I grew much better, I should not be willing; if"
2426,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"much worse, I should not be able to migrate. Your lordship was first"
2427,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,solicited without my knowledge; but when I was told that you were
2428,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"pleased to honour me with your patronage, I did not expect to hear of"
2429,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"a refusal; yet, as I have had no long time to brood hopes, and have"
2430,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"not rioted in imaginary opulence, this cold reception has been scarce"
2431,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,a disappointment; and from your lordship's kindness I have received a
2432,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"benefit which only men, like you, are able to bestow. I shall now live"
2433,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"_mihi carior_, with a higher opinion of my own merit."
2434,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2435,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"I am, my lord,"
2436,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2437,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Your lordship's most obliged,"
2438,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2439,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Most grateful, and most humble servant,"
2440,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2441,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,SAMUEL JOHNSON.
2442,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2443,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"September, 1784."""
2444,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2445,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"We have, in this instance, the exertion of two congenial minds; one,"
2446,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"with a generous impulse, relieving merit in distress; and the other, by"
2447,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"gratitude and dignity of sentiment, rising to an equal elevation."
2448,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2449,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"It seems, however, that greatness of mind is not confined to greatness"
2450,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,of rank. Dr. Brocklesby was not content to assist with his medical art;
2451,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"he resolved to minister to his patient's mind, and pluck from his memory"
2452,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,the sorrow which the late refusal from a high quarter might occasion. To
2453,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"enable him to visit the south of France, in pursuit of health, he"
2454,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"offered, from his own funds, an annuity of one hundred pounds, payable"
2455,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"quarterly. This was a sweet oblivious antidote, but it was not accepted,"
2456,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"for the reasons assigned to the chancellor. The proposal, however, will"
2457,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"do honour to Dr. Brocklesby, as long as liberal sentiment shall be"
2458,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,ranked among the social virtues.
2459,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2460,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"In the month of October, 1784, we find Dr. Johnson corresponding with"
2461,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Mr. Nichols, the intelligent compiler of the Gentleman's Magazine, and,"
2462,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"in the languor of sickness, still desirous to contribute all in his"
2463,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"power to the advancement of science and useful knowledge. He says, in a"
2464,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"letter to that gentleman, dated Lichfield, October 20, that ""he should"
2465,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"be glad to give so skilful a lover of antiquities any information."" He"
2466,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"adds, ""At Ashbourne, where I had very little company, I had the luck to"
2467,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"borrow Mr. Bowyer's Life, a book, so full of contemporary history, that"
2468,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,a literary man must find some of his old friends. I thought that I
2469,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"could, now and then, have told you some hints worth your notice: we,"
2470,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"perhaps, may talk a life over. I hope we shall be much together. You"
2471,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"must now be to me what you were before, and what dear Mr. Allen was"
2472,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"besides. He was taken unexpectedly away, but, I think, he was a very"
2473,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"good man. I have made very little progress in recovery. I am very weak,"
2474,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"and very sleepless; but I live on and hope."""
2475,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2476,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"In that languid condition he arrived, on the 16th of November, at his"
2477,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"house in Bolt court, there to end his days. He laboured with the dropsy"
2478,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"and an asthma. He was attended by Dr. Heberden, Dr. Warren, Dr."
2479,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Brocklesby, Dr. Butter, and Mr. Cruikshank, the eminent surgeon."
2480,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"Eternity presented to his mind an awful prospect, and, with as much"
2481,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"virtue as, perhaps, ever is the lot of man, he shuddered at the thought"
2482,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,of his dissolution. His friends awakened the comfortable reflection of a
2483,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"well-spent life; and, as his end drew near, they had the satisfaction of"
2484,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"seeing him composed, and even cheerful, insomuch that he was able, in"
2485,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"the course of his restless nights, to make translations of Greek"
2486,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,epigrams from the Anthologia; and to compose a Latin epitaph for his
2487,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"father, his mother, and his brother Nathaniel. He meditated, at the same"
2488,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"time, a Latin inscription to the memory of Garrick; but his vigour was"
2489,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,exhausted.
2490,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,
2491,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,His love of literature was a passion that stuck to his last sand. Seven
2492,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,days before his death he wrote the following letter to his friend Mr.

2500,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"authors, at the request of sir Robert Chambers, or myself, gave the"
2501,SAMUEL JOHNSON.,"account which I now transmit to you, in his own hand, being willing"

2549,SAM. JOHNSON.,"that he then declared, that ""those debates were the only parts of his"
2550,SAM. JOHNSON.,"writings which gave him any compunction: but that, at the time he wrote"
2551,SAM. JOHNSON.,"them, he had no conception that he was imposing upon the world, though"
2552,SAM. JOHNSON.,"they were, frequently, written from very slender materials, and often"
2553,SAM. JOHNSON.,"from none at all, the mere coinage of his own imagination."" He added,"
2554,SAM. JOHNSON.,"""that he never wrote any part of his work with equal velocity."" ""Three"
2555,SAM. JOHNSON.,"columns of the magazine in an hour,"" he said, ""was no uncommon effort;"
2556,SAM. JOHNSON.,which was faster than most persons could have transcribed that quantity.
2557,SAM. JOHNSON.,"In one day, in particular, and that not a very long one, he wrote twelve"
2558,SAM. JOHNSON.,"pages, more in quantity than ever he wrote at any other time, except in"
2559,SAM. JOHNSON.,"the Life of Savage, of which forty-eight pages, in octavo, were the"
2560,SAM. JOHNSON.,"production of one long day, including a part of the night."""
2561,SAM. JOHNSON.,
2562,SAM. JOHNSON.,"In the course of the conversation, he asked whether any of the family of"
2563,SAM. JOHNSON.,"Faden, the printer, were living. Being told that the geographer, near"
2564,SAM. JOHNSON.,"Charing Cross, was Faden's son, he said, after a short pause, ""I"
2565,SAM. JOHNSON.,borrowed a guinea of his father near thirty years ago; be so good as to
2566,SAM. JOHNSON.,"take this, and pay it for me."""
2567,SAM. JOHNSON.,
2568,SAM. JOHNSON.,"Wishing to discharge every duty, and every obligation, Johnson"
2569,SAM. JOHNSON.,"recollected another debt of ten pounds, which he had borrowed from his"
2570,SAM. JOHNSON.,"friend, Mr. Hamilton, the printer, about twenty years before. He sent"
2571,SAM. JOHNSON.,"the money to Mr. Hamilton, at his house in Bedford row, with an apology"
2572,SAM. JOHNSON.,for the length of time. The reverend Mr. Strahan was the bearer of the
2573,SAM. JOHNSON.,"message, about four or five days before Johnson breathed his last."
2574,SAM. JOHNSON.,
2575,SAM. JOHNSON.,"Mr. Sastres, whom Dr. Johnson esteemed and mentioned in his will,"
2576,SAM. JOHNSON.,"entered the room, during his illness. Dr. Johnson, as soon as he saw"
2577,SAM. JOHNSON.,"him, stretched forth his hand, and, in a tone of lamentation, called"
2578,SAM. JOHNSON.,"out, ""Jam moriturus!"" But the love of life was still an active"
2579,SAM. JOHNSON.,"principle. Feeling himself swelled with the dropsy, he conceived that,"
2580,SAM. JOHNSON.,"by incisions in his legs, the water might be discharged. Mr. Cruikshank"
2581,SAM. JOHNSON.,"apprehended that a mortification might be the consequence; but, to"
2582,SAM. JOHNSON.,"appease a distempered fancy, he gently lanced the surface. Johnson cried"
2583,SAM. JOHNSON.,"out, ""Deeper, deeper! I want length of life, and you are afraid of"
2584,SAM. JOHNSON.,"giving me pain, which I do not value."""
2585,SAM. JOHNSON.,
2586,SAM. JOHNSON.,"On the 8th of December, the reverend Mr. Strahan drew his will, by"
2587,SAM. JOHNSON.,"which, after a few legacies, the residue, amounting to about fifteen"
2588,SAM. JOHNSON.,"hundred pounds, was bequeathed to Frank, the black servant, formerly"
2589,SAM. JOHNSON.,consigned to the testator by his friend Dr. Bathurst.
2590,SAM. JOHNSON.,
2591,SAM. JOHNSON.,"The history of a death-bed is painful. Mr. Strahan informs us, that the"
2592,SAM. JOHNSON.,strength of religion prevailed against the infirmity of nature; and his
2593,SAM. JOHNSON.,"foreboding dread of the divine justice subsided into a pious trust, and"
2594,SAM. JOHNSON.,"humble hope of mercy, at the throne of grace. On Monday, the 13th day of"
2595,SAM. JOHNSON.,"December, the last of his existence on this side the grave, the desire"
2596,SAM. JOHNSON.,"of life returned with all its former vehemence. He still imagined, that,"
2597,SAM. JOHNSON.,"by puncturing his legs, relief might be obtained. At eight in the"
2598,SAM. JOHNSON.,"morning he tried the experiment, but no water followed. In an hour or"
2599,SAM. JOHNSON.,"two after, he fell into a doze, and about seven in the evening expired"
2600,SAM. JOHNSON.,without a groan.
2601,SAM. JOHNSON.,
2602,SAM. JOHNSON.,"On the 20th of the month his remains, with due solemnities, and a"
2603,SAM. JOHNSON.,"numerous attendance of his friends, were buried in Westminster abbey,"
2604,SAM. JOHNSON.,"near the foot of Shakespeare's monument, and close to the grave of the"
2605,SAM. JOHNSON.,"late Mr. Garrick. The funeral service was read by his friend, Dr."
2606,SAM. JOHNSON.,Taylor.
2607,SAM. JOHNSON.,
2608,SAM. JOHNSON.,A black marble over his grave has the following inscription:
2609,SAM. JOHNSON.,
2610,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D."
2611,"SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.","obiit XIII die Decembris,"

2616,MDCCLXXXIV.,"If we now look back, as from an eminence, to view the scenes of life,"
2617,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and the literary labours in which Dr. Johnson was engaged, we may be"
2618,MDCCLXXXIV.,"able to delineate the features of the man, and to form an estimate of"
2619,MDCCLXXXIV.,his genius.
2620,MDCCLXXXIV.,
2621,MDCCLXXXIV.,"As a man, Dr. Johnson stands displayed in open daylight. Nothing remains"
2622,MDCCLXXXIV.,undiscovered. Whatever he said is known; and without allowing him the
2623,MDCCLXXXIV.,"usual privilege of hazarding sentiments, and advancing positions for"
2624,MDCCLXXXIV.,"mere amusement, or the pleasure of discussion, criticism has endeavoured"
2625,MDCCLXXXIV.,"to make him answerable for what, perhaps, he never seriously thought."
2626,MDCCLXXXIV.,"His diary, which has been printed, discovers still more. We have before"
2627,MDCCLXXXIV.,"us the very heart of the man, with all his inward consciousness; and yet"
2628,MDCCLXXXIV.,"neither in the open paths of life, nor in his secret recesses, has any"
2629,MDCCLXXXIV.,"one vice been discovered. We see him reviewing every year of his life,"
2630,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and severely censuring himself, for not keeping resolutions, which"
2631,MDCCLXXXIV.,"morbid melancholy, and other bodily infirmities, rendered impracticable."
2632,MDCCLXXXIV.,"We see him, for every little defect, imposing on himself voluntary"
2633,MDCCLXXXIV.,"penance, going through the day with only one cup of tea without milk,"
2634,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and to the last, amidst paroxysms and remissions of illness, forming"
2635,MDCCLXXXIV.,plans of study and resolutions to amend his life[aa]. Many of his
2636,MDCCLXXXIV.,scruples may be called weaknesses; but they are the weaknesses of a
2637,MDCCLXXXIV.,"good, a pious, and most excellent man."
2638,MDCCLXXXIV.,
2639,MDCCLXXXIV.,"His person, it is well known, was large and unwieldy. His nerves were"
2640,MDCCLXXXIV.,"affected by that disorder, for which, at two years of age, he was"
2641,MDCCLXXXIV.,"presented to the royal touch. His head shook, and involuntary motions"
2642,MDCCLXXXIV.,"made it uncertain that his legs and arms would, even at a tea-table,"
2643,MDCCLXXXIV.,remain in their proper place. A person of lord Chesterfield's delicacy
2644,MDCCLXXXIV.,"might, in his company, be in a fever. He would, sometimes, of his own"
2645,MDCCLXXXIV.,"accord, do things inconsistent with the established modes of behaviour."
2646,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Sitting at table with the celebrated Mrs. Cholmondeley, who exerted"
2647,MDCCLXXXIV.,"herself to circulate the subscription for Shakespeare, he took hold of"
2648,MDCCLXXXIV.,"her hand, in the middle of dinner, and held it close to his eye,"
2649,MDCCLXXXIV.,"wondering at the delicacy and whiteness, till, with a smile, she asked,"
2650,MDCCLXXXIV.,"""Will he give it to me again, when he has done with it?"" The exteriors"
2651,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of politeness did not belong to Johnson. Even that civility, which"
2652,MDCCLXXXIV.,"proceeds, or ought to proceed, from the mind, was sometimes violated."
2653,MDCCLXXXIV.,His morbid melancholy had an effect on his temper; his passions were
2654,MDCCLXXXIV.,"irritable; and the pride of science, as well as of a fierce independent"
2655,MDCCLXXXIV.,"spirit, inflamed him, on some occasions, above all bounds of moderation."
2656,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Though not in the shade of academic bowers, he led a scholastic life;"
2657,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and the habit of pronouncing decisions to his friends and visitors, gave"
2658,MDCCLXXXIV.,"him a dictatorial manner, which was much enforced by a voice naturally"
2659,MDCCLXXXIV.,"loud, and often overstretched. Metaphysical discussion, moral theory,"
2660,MDCCLXXXIV.,"systems of religion, and anecdotes of literature, were his favourite"
2661,MDCCLXXXIV.,topics. General history had little of his regard. Biography was his
2662,MDCCLXXXIV.,delight. The proper study of mankind is man. Sooner than hear of the
2663,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Punic war, he would be rude to the person that introduced the subject."
2664,MDCCLXXXIV.,
2665,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Johnson was born a logician; one of those, to whom only books of logic"
2666,MDCCLXXXIV.,"are said to be of use. In consequence of his skill in that art, he loved"
2667,MDCCLXXXIV.,"argumentation. No man thought more profoundly, nor with such acute"
2668,MDCCLXXXIV.,discernment. A fallacy could not stand before him; it was sure to be
2669,MDCCLXXXIV.,"refuted by strength of reasoning, and a precision, both in idea and"
2670,MDCCLXXXIV.,"expression, almost unequalled. When he chose, by apt illustration, to"
2671,MDCCLXXXIV.,"place the argument of his adversary in a ludicrous light, one was almost"
2672,MDCCLXXXIV.,inclined to think ridicule the test of truth. He was surprised to be
2673,MDCCLXXXIV.,"told, but it is certainly true, that, with great powers of mind, wit and"
2674,MDCCLXXXIV.,humour were his shining talents. That he often argued for the sake of
2675,MDCCLXXXIV.,"triumph over his adversary, cannot be dissembled. Dr. Rose, of Chiswick,"
2676,MDCCLXXXIV.,"has been heard to tell of a friend of his, who thanked him for"
2677,MDCCLXXXIV.,"introducing him to Dr. Johnson, as he had been convinced, in the course"
2678,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of a long dispute, that an opinion, which he had embraced as a settled"
2679,MDCCLXXXIV.,"truth, was no better than a vulgar error. This being reported to"
2680,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Johnson, ""Nay,"" said he, ""do not let him be thankful, for he was right,"
2681,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and I was wrong."" Like his uncle Andrew, in the ring at Smithfield,"
2682,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Johnson, in a circle of disputants, was determined neither to be thrown"
2683,MDCCLXXXIV.,"nor conquered. Notwithstanding all his piety, self-government or the"
2684,MDCCLXXXIV.,"command of his passions in conversation, does not seem to have been"
2685,MDCCLXXXIV.,among his attainments. Whenever he thought the contention was for
2686,MDCCLXXXIV.,"superiority, he has been known to break out with violence, and even"
2687,MDCCLXXXIV.,"ferocity. When the fray was over, he generally softened into repentance,"
2688,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and, by conciliating measures, took care that no animosity should be"
2689,MDCCLXXXIV.,left rankling in the breast of his antagonist. Of this defect he seems
2690,MDCCLXXXIV.,"to have been conscious. In a letter to Mrs. Thrale, he says, ""Poor"
2691,MDCCLXXXIV.,Baretti! do not quarrel with him; to neglect him a little will be
2692,MDCCLXXXIV.,"sufficient. He means only to be frank and manly and independent, and,"
2693,MDCCLXXXIV.,"perhaps, as you say, a little wise. To be frank, he thinks, is to be"
2694,MDCCLXXXIV.,"cynical; and to be independent, is to be rude. Forgive him, dearest"
2695,MDCCLXXXIV.,"lady, the rather, because of his misbehaviour, I am afraid, he learned"
2696,MDCCLXXXIV.,"part of me. I hope to set him, hereafter, a better example."" For his own"
2697,MDCCLXXXIV.,"intolerant and over-bearing spirit he apologized, by observing, that it"
2698,MDCCLXXXIV.,had done some good; obscenity and impiety were repressed in his company.
2699,MDCCLXXXIV.,
2700,MDCCLXXXIV.,"It was late in life, before he had the habit of mixing, otherwise than"
2701,MDCCLXXXIV.,"occasionally, with polite company. At Mr. Thrale's he saw a constant"
2702,MDCCLXXXIV.,succession of well-accomplished visiters. In that society he began to
2703,MDCCLXXXIV.,wear off the rugged points of his own character. He saw the advantages
2704,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of mutual civility, and endeavoured to profit by the models before him."
2705,MDCCLXXXIV.,"He aimed at what has been called, by Swift, the ""lesser morals,"" and by"
2706,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Cicero, ""minores virtutes."" His endeavour, though new and late, gave"
2707,MDCCLXXXIV.,pleasure to all his acquaintance. Men were glad to see that he was
2708,MDCCLXXXIV.,willing to be communicative on equal terms and reciprocal complacence.
2709,MDCCLXXXIV.,"The time was then expected, when he was to cease being what George"
2710,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Garrick, brother to the celebrated actor, called him, the first time he"
2711,MDCCLXXXIV.,"heard him converse, ""a tremendous companion."" He certainly wished to be"
2712,MDCCLXXXIV.,"polite, and even thought himself so; but his civility still retained"
2713,MDCCLXXXIV.,"something uncouth and harsh. His manners took a milder tone, but the"
2714,MDCCLXXXIV.,endeavour was too palpably seen. He laboured even in trifles. He was a
2715,MDCCLXXXIV.,giant gaining a purchase to lift a feather.
2716,MDCCLXXXIV.,
2717,MDCCLXXXIV.,"It is observed, by the younger Pliny, that ""in the confines of virtue"
2718,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and great qualities, there are, generally, vices of an opposite nature."""
2719,MDCCLXXXIV.,In Dr. Johnson not one ingredient can take the name of vice. From his
2720,MDCCLXXXIV.,"attainments in literature, grew the pride of knowledge; and from his"
2721,MDCCLXXXIV.,"powers of reasoning, the love of disputation and the vain glory of"
2722,MDCCLXXXIV.,"superior vigour.--His piety, in some instances, bordered on"
2723,MDCCLXXXIV.,"superstition. He was willing to believe in preternatural agency, and"
2724,MDCCLXXXIV.,"thought it not more strange, that there should be evil spirits than evil"
2725,MDCCLXXXIV.,"men. Even the question about second sight held him in suspense. ""Second"
2726,MDCCLXXXIV.,"sight,"" Mr. Pennant tells us, ""is a power of seeing images impressed on"
2727,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the organs of sight, by the power of fancy; or on the fancy, by the"
2728,MDCCLXXXIV.,disordered spirits operating on the mind. It is the faculty of seeing
2729,MDCCLXXXIV.,"spectres or visions, which represent an event actually passing at a"
2730,MDCCLXXXIV.,"distance, or likely to happen at a future day. In 1771, a gentleman, the"
2731,MDCCLXXXIV.,"last who was supposed to be possessed of this faculty, had a boat at"
2732,MDCCLXXXIV.,"sea, in a tempestuous night, and, being anxious for his freight,"
2733,MDCCLXXXIV.,"suddenly started up, and said his men would be drowned, for he had seen"
2734,MDCCLXXXIV.,them pass before him with wet garments and dropping locks. The event
2735,MDCCLXXXIV.,"corresponded with his disordered fancy. And thus,"" continues Mr."
2736,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Pennant, ""a distempered imagination, clouded with anxiety, may make an"
2737,MDCCLXXXIV.,"impression on the spirits; as persons, restless, and troubled with"
2738,MDCCLXXXIV.,"indignation, see various forms and figures, while they lie awake in"
2739,MDCCLXXXIV.,"bed."" This is what Dr. Johnson was not willing to reject. He wished for"
2740,MDCCLXXXIV.,some positive proof of communications with another world. His
2741,MDCCLXXXIV.,"benevolence embraced the whole race of man, and yet was tinctured with"
2742,MDCCLXXXIV.,particular prejudices. He was pleased with the minister in the isle of
2743,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Skie, and loved him so much, that he began to wish him not a"
2744,MDCCLXXXIV.,presbyterian. To that body of dissenters his zeal for the established
2745,MDCCLXXXIV.,"church, made him, in some degree, an adversary; and his attachment to a"
2746,MDCCLXXXIV.,"mixed and limited monarchy, led him to declare open war against what he"
2747,MDCCLXXXIV.,called a sullen republican. He would rather praise a man of Oxford than
2748,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of Cambridge. He disliked a whig, and loved a tory. These were the"
2749,MDCCLXXXIV.,"shades of his character, which it has been the business of certain"
2750,MDCCLXXXIV.,party-writers to represent in the darkest colours.
2751,MDCCLXXXIV.,
2752,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Since virtue, or moral goodness, consists in a just conformity of our"
2753,MDCCLXXXIV.,"actions to the relations, in which we stand to the supreme being and to"
2754,MDCCLXXXIV.,"our fellow-creatures, where shall we find a man who has been, or"
2755,MDCCLXXXIV.,"endeavoured to be, more diligent in the discharge of those essential"
2756,MDCCLXXXIV.,duties? His first prayer was composed in 1738; he continued those
2757,MDCCLXXXIV.,fervent ejaculations of piety to the end of his life. In his Meditations
2758,MDCCLXXXIV.,"we see him scrutinizing himself with severity, and aiming at perfection"
2759,MDCCLXXXIV.,unattainable by man. His duty to his neighbour consisted in universal
2760,MDCCLXXXIV.,"benevolence, and a constant aim at the production of happiness. Who was"
2761,MDCCLXXXIV.,"more sincere and steady in his friendships? It has been said, that there"
2762,MDCCLXXXIV.,was no real affection between him and Garrick. On the part of the
2763,MDCCLXXXIV.,"latter, there might be some corrosions of jealousy. The character of"
2764,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Prospero, in the Rambler, No. 200, was, beyond all question, occasioned"
2765,MDCCLXXXIV.,by Garrick's ostentatious display of furniture and Dresden china. It was
2766,MDCCLXXXIV.,"surely fair to take, from this incident, a hint for a moral essay; and,"
2767,MDCCLXXXIV.,"though no more was intended, Garrick, we are told, remembered it with"
2768,MDCCLXXXIV.,"uneasiness. He was also hurt, that his Lichfield friend did not think so"
2769,MDCCLXXXIV.,"highly of his dramatic art, as the rest of the world. The fact was,"
2770,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Johnson could not see the passions, as they rose, and chased one"
2771,MDCCLXXXIV.,"another, in the varied features of that expressive face; and, by his own"
2772,MDCCLXXXIV.,"manner of reciting verses, which was wonderfully impressive, he plainly"
2773,MDCCLXXXIV.,"showed, that he thought, there was too much of artificial tone and"
2774,MDCCLXXXIV.,"measured cadence, in the declamation of the theatre. The present writer"
2775,MDCCLXXXIV.,"well remembers being in conversation with Dr. Johnson, near the side of"
2776,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the scenes, during the tragedy of King Lear: when Garrick came off the"
2777,MDCCLXXXIV.,"stage, he said, ""You two talk so loud, you destroy all my feelings."""
2778,MDCCLXXXIV.,"""Prithee,"" replied Johnson, ""do not talk of feelings, Punch has no"
2779,MDCCLXXXIV.,"feelings."" This seems to have been his settled opinion; admirable as"
2780,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Garrick's imitation of nature always was, Johnson thought it no better"
2781,MDCCLXXXIV.,"than mere mimickry. Yet, it is certain, that he esteemed and loved"
2782,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Garrick; that he dwelt with pleasure on his praise; and used to declare,"
2783,MDCCLXXXIV.,"that he deserved his great success, because, on all applications for"
2784,MDCCLXXXIV.,"charity, he gave more than was asked. After Garrick's death, he never"
2785,MDCCLXXXIV.,"talked of him, without a tear in his eye. He offered, if Mrs. Garrick"
2786,MDCCLXXXIV.,"would desire it of him, to be the editor of his works, and the historian"
2787,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of his life[bb]. It has been mentioned, that, on his death-bed, he"
2788,MDCCLXXXIV.,thought of writing a Latin inscription to the memory of his friend.
2789,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Numbers are still living who know these facts, and still remember, with"
2790,MDCCLXXXIV.,"gratitude, the friendship which he showed to them, with unaltered"
2791,MDCCLXXXIV.,"affection, for a number of years. His humanity and generosity, in"
2792,MDCCLXXXIV.,"proportion to his slender income, were unbounded. It has been truly"
2793,MDCCLXXXIV.,"said, that the lame, the blind, and the sorrowful, found, in his house,"
2794,MDCCLXXXIV.,a sure retreat. A strict adherence to truth he considered as a sacred
2795,MDCCLXXXIV.,"obligation, insomuch that, in relating the most minute anecdote, he"
2796,MDCCLXXXIV.,would not allow himself the smallest addition to embellish his story.
2797,MDCCLXXXIV.,"The late Mr. Tyers, who knew Dr. Johnson intimately, observed, ""that he"
2798,MDCCLXXXIV.,"always talked, as if he was talking upon oath."""
2799,MDCCLXXXIV.,
2800,MDCCLXXXIV.,"After a long acquaintance with this excellent man, and an attentive"
2801,MDCCLXXXIV.,"retrospect to his whole conduct, such is the light in which he appears"
2802,MDCCLXXXIV.,"to the writer of this essay. The following lines of Horace, may be"
2803,MDCCLXXXIV.,deemed his picture in miniature:

2823,MDCCLXXXIV.,"It remains to give a review of Johnson's works; and this, it is"
2824,MDCCLXXXIV.,"imagined, will not be unwelcome to the reader."
2825,MDCCLXXXIV.,
2826,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Like Milton and Addison, he seems to have been fond of his Latin poetry."
2827,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Those compositions show, that he was an early scholar; but his verses"
2828,MDCCLXXXIV.,"have not the graceful ease, that gave so much suavity to the poems of"
2829,MDCCLXXXIV.,Addison. The translation of the Messiah labours under two disadvantages:
2830,MDCCLXXXIV.,"it is first to be compared with Pope's inimitable performance, and"
2831,MDCCLXXXIV.,"afterwards with the Pollio of Virgil. It may appear trifling to remark,"
2832,MDCCLXXXIV.,"that he has made the letter _o_, in the word _virgo_, long and short in"
2833,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the same line: ""Virgo, virgo parit."" But the translation has great"
2834,MDCCLXXXIV.,"merit, and some admirable lines. In the odes there is a sweet"
2835,MDCCLXXXIV.,"flexibility, particularly--to his worthy friend Dr. Lawrence; on himself"
2836,MDCCLXXXIV.,"at the theatre, March 8, 1771; the ode in the isle of Skie; and that to"
2837,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Mrs. Thrale, from the same place."

2839,MDCCLXXXIV.,"His English poetry is such as leaves room to think, if he had devoted"
2840,MDCCLXXXIV.,"himself to the muses, that he would have been the rival of Pope. His"
2841,MDCCLXXXIV.,"first production, in this kind, was London, a poem in imitation of the"
2842,MDCCLXXXIV.,third satire of Juvenal. The vices of the metropolis are placed in the
2843,MDCCLXXXIV.,room of ancient manners. The author had heated his mind with the ardour
2844,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of Juvenal, and, having the skill to polish his numbers, he became a"
2845,MDCCLXXXIV.,"sharp accuser of the times. The Vanity of Human Wishes, is an imitation"
2846,MDCCLXXXIV.,of the tenth satire of the same author. Though it is translated by
2847,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Dryden, Johnson's imitation approaches nearest to the spirit of the"
2848,MDCCLXXXIV.,"original. The subject is taken from the Alcibiades of Plato, and has an"
2849,MDCCLXXXIV.,"intermixture of the sentiments of Socrates, concerning the object of"
2850,MDCCLXXXIV.,"prayers offered up to the deity. The general proposition is, that good"
2851,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and evil are so little understood by mankind, that their wishes, when"
2852,MDCCLXXXIV.,"granted, are always destructive. This is exemplified in a variety of"
2853,MDCCLXXXIV.,"instances, such as riches, state-preferment, eloquence, military glory,"
2854,MDCCLXXXIV.,"long life, and the advantages of form and beauty. Juvenal's conclusion"
2855,MDCCLXXXIV.,"is worthy of a christian poet, and such a pen as Johnson's. ""Let us,"" he"
2856,MDCCLXXXIV.,"says, ""leave it to the gods to judge what is fittest for us. Man is"
2857,MDCCLXXXIV.,dearer to his creator than to himself. If we must pray for special
2858,MDCCLXXXIV.,"favour, let it be for a sound mind in a sound body. Let us pray for"
2859,MDCCLXXXIV.,"fortitude, that we may think the labours of Hercules, and all his"
2860,MDCCLXXXIV.,"sufferings, preferable to a life of luxury, and the soft repose of"
2861,MDCCLXXXIV.,Sardanapalus. This is a blessing within the reach of every man; this we
2862,MDCCLXXXIV.,"can give ourselves. It is virtue, and virtue only, that can make us"
2863,MDCCLXXXIV.,"happy."" In the translation, the zeal of the christian conspired with the"
2864,MDCCLXXXIV.,warmth and energy of the poet; but Juvenal is not eclipsed. For the
2865,MDCCLXXXIV.,"various characters in the original, the reader is pleased, in the"
2866,MDCCLXXXIV.,"English poem, to meet with cardinal Wolsey, Buckingham stabbed by"
2867,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Felton, lord Strafford, Clarendon, Charles the twelfth of Sweden; and"
2868,MDCCLXXXIV.,"for Tully and Demosthenes, Lydiat, Galileo, and archbishop Laud. It is"
2869,MDCCLXXXIV.,"owing to Johnson's delight in biography, that the name of Lydiat is"
2870,MDCCLXXXIV.,"called forth from obscurity. It may, therefore, not be useless to tell,"
2871,MDCCLXXXIV.,that Lydiat was a learned divine and mathematician in the beginning of
2872,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the last century. He attacked the doctrine of Aristotle and Scaliger,"
2873,MDCCLXXXIV.,and wrote a number of sermons on the harmony of the evangelists. With
2874,MDCCLXXXIV.,"all his merit, he lay in the prison of Bocardo, at Oxford, till bishop"
2875,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Usher, Laud, and others, paid his debts. He petitioned Charles the first"
2876,MDCCLXXXIV.,"to be sent to Ethiopia, to procure manuscripts. Having spoken in favour"
2877,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of monarchy and bishops, he was plundered by the puritans, and twice"
2878,MDCCLXXXIV.,"carried away, a prisoner, from his rectory. He died, very poor, in 1646."
2879,MDCCLXXXIV.,
2880,MDCCLXXXIV.,The tragedy of Irene is founded on a passage in Knolles's History of the
2881,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Turks; an author highly commended in the Rambler, No. 122. An incident"
2882,MDCCLXXXIV.,"in the life of Mahomet the great, first emperor of the Turks, is the"
2883,MDCCLXXXIV.,hinge on which the fable is made to move. The substance of the story is
2884,MDCCLXXXIV.,"shortly this: In 1453, Mahomet laid siege to Constantinople, and having"
2885,MDCCLXXXIV.,"reduced the place, became enamoured of a fair Greek, whose name was"
2886,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Irene. The sultan invited her to embrace the law of the prophet, and to"
2887,MDCCLXXXIV.,"grace his throne. Enraged at this intended marriage, the janizaries"
2888,MDCCLXXXIV.,formed a conspiracy to dethrone the emperor. To avert the impending
2889,MDCCLXXXIV.,"danger, Mahomet, in a full assembly of the grandees, ""catching with one"
2890,MDCCLXXXIV.,"hand,"" as Knolles relates it, ""the fair Greek by the hair of her head,"
2891,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and drawing his falchion with the other, he, at one blow, struck off her"
2892,MDCCLXXXIV.,"head, to the great terror of them all; and, having so done, said unto"
2893,MDCCLXXXIV.,"them: 'Now by this, judge whether your emperor is able to bridle his"
2894,MDCCLXXXIV.,"affections or not.'"" The story is simple, and it remained for the author"
2895,MDCCLXXXIV.,"to amplify it, with proper episodes, and give it complication and"
2896,MDCCLXXXIV.,"variety. The catastrophe is changed, and horror gives place to terror"
2897,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and pity. But, after all, the fable is cold and languid. There is not,"
2898,MDCCLXXXIV.,"throughout the piece, a single situation to excite curiosity, and raise"
2899,MDCCLXXXIV.,"a conflict of passions. The diction is nervous, rich, and elegant; but"
2900,MDCCLXXXIV.,"splendid language, and melodious numbers, will make a fine poem--not a"
2901,MDCCLXXXIV.,"tragedy. The sentiments are beautiful, always happily expressed, but"
2902,MDCCLXXXIV.,"seldom appropriated to the character, and generally too philosophic."
2903,MDCCLXXXIV.,"What Johnson has said of the tragedy of Cato, may be applied to Irene:"
2904,MDCCLXXXIV.,"""It is rather a poem in dialogue than a drama; rather a succession of"
2905,MDCCLXXXIV.,"just sentiments, in elegant language, than a representation of natural"
2906,MDCCLXXXIV.,affections. Nothing excites or assuages emotion. The events are expected
2907,MDCCLXXXIV.,"without solicitude, and are remembered without joy or sorrow. Of the"
2908,MDCCLXXXIV.,"agents we have no care; we consider not what they are doing, nor what"
2909,MDCCLXXXIV.,"they are suffering; we wish only to know, what they have to say. It is"
2910,MDCCLXXXIV.,"unaffecting elegance, and chill philosophy."" The following speech, in"
2911,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the mouth of a Turk, who is supposed to have heard of the British"
2912,MDCCLXXXIV.,"constitution, has been often selected from the numberless beauties with"
2913,MDCCLXXXIV.,which Irene abounds:
2914,MDCCLXXXIV.,
2915,MDCCLXXXIV.,"""If there be any land, as fame reports,"
2916,MDCCLXXXIV.,Where common laws restrain the prince and subject;
2917,MDCCLXXXIV.,"A happy land, where circulating power"
2918,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Flows through each member of th' embodied state,"
2919,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Sure, not unconscious of the mighty blessing,"
2920,MDCCLXXXIV.,Her grateful sons shine bright with ev'ry virtue;
2921,MDCCLXXXIV.,Untainted with the LUST OF INNOVATION;
2922,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Sure, all unite to hold her league of rule,"
2923,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Unbroken, as the sacred chain of nature,"
2924,MDCCLXXXIV.,"That links the jarring elements in peace."""
2925,MDCCLXXXIV.,
2926,MDCCLXXXIV.,"These are British sentiments. Above forty years ago, they found an echo"
2927,MDCCLXXXIV.,in the breast of applauding audiences; and to this hour they are the
2928,MDCCLXXXIV.,"voice of the people, in defiance of the metaphysics, and the new lights"
2929,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of certain politicians, who would gladly find their private advantage in"
2930,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the disasters of their country; a race of men, ""quibus nulla ex honesto"
2931,MDCCLXXXIV.,"spes."""
2932,MDCCLXXXIV.,
2933,MDCCLXXXIV.,"The prologue to Irene is written with elegance, and, in a peculiar"
2934,MDCCLXXXIV.,"style, shows the literary pride and lofty spirit of the author. The"
2935,MDCCLXXXIV.,"epilogue, we are told, in a late publication, was written by sir William"
2936,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Yonge. This is a new discovery, but by no means probable. When the"
2937,MDCCLXXXIV.,"appendages to a dramatic performance are not assigned to a friend, or an"
2938,MDCCLXXXIV.,"unknown hand, or a person of fashion, they are always supposed to be"
2939,MDCCLXXXIV.,"written by the author of the play. It is to be wished, however, that the"
2940,MDCCLXXXIV.,"epilogue, in question, could be transferred to any other writer. It is"
2941,MDCCLXXXIV.,the worst jeu d'esprit that ever fell from Johnson's pen[cc].
2942,MDCCLXXXIV.,
2943,MDCCLXXXIV.,"An account of the various pieces contained in this edition, such as"
2944,MDCCLXXXIV.,"miscellaneous tracts, and philological dissertations, would lead beyond"
2945,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the intended limits of this essay. It will suffice to say, that they are"
2946,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the productions of a man, who never wanted decorations of language, and"
2947,MDCCLXXXIV.,"always taught his reader to think. The life of the late king of Prussia,"
2948,MDCCLXXXIV.,"as far as it extends, is a model of the biographical style. The review"
2949,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of the Origin of Evil was, perhaps, written with asperity; but the angry"
2950,MDCCLXXXIV.,"epitaph which it provoked from Soame Jenyns, was an ill-timed"
2951,MDCCLXXXIV.,"resentment, unworthy of the genius of that amiable author."
2952,MDCCLXXXIV.,
2953,MDCCLXXXIV.,"The Rambler may be considered, as Johnson's great work. It was the basis"
2954,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of that high reputation, which went on increasing to the end of his"
2955,MDCCLXXXIV.,"days. The circulation of those periodical essays was not, at first,"
2956,MDCCLXXXIV.,"equal to their merit. They had not, like the Spectators, the art of"
2957,MDCCLXXXIV.,"charming by variety; and, indeed, how could it be expected? The wits of"
2958,MDCCLXXXIV.,queen Anne's reign sent their contributions to the Spectator; and
2959,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Johnson stood alone. A stagecoach, says sir Richard Steele, must go"
2960,MDCCLXXXIV.,"forward on stated days, whether there are passengers or not. So it was"
2961,MDCCLXXXIV.,"with the Rambler, every Tuesday and Saturday, for two years. In this"
2962,MDCCLXXXIV.,collection Johnson is the great moral teacher of his countrymen; his
2963,MDCCLXXXIV.,"essays form a body of ethics; the observations on life and manners, are"
2964,MDCCLXXXIV.,"acute and instructive; and the papers, professedly critical, serve to"
2965,MDCCLXXXIV.,"promote the cause of literature. It must, however, be acknowledged, that"
2966,MDCCLXXXIV.,"a settled gloom hangs over the author's mind; and all the essays, except"
2967,MDCCLXXXIV.,"eight or ten, coming from the same fountain-head, no wonder that they"
2968,MDCCLXXXIV.,have the raciness of the soil from which they sprang. Of this uniformity
2969,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Johnson was sensible. He used to say, that if he had joined a friend or"
2970,MDCCLXXXIV.,"two, who would have been able to intermix papers of a sprightly turn,"
2971,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the collection would have been more miscellaneous, and, by consequence,"
2972,MDCCLXXXIV.,more agreeable to the generality of readers. This he used to illustrate
2973,MDCCLXXXIV.,"by repeating two beautiful stanzas from his own ode to Cave, or Sylvanus"
2974,MDCCLXXXIV.,Urban:
2975,MDCCLXXXIV.,
2976,MDCCLXXXIV.,"""Non ulla musis pagina gratior,"
2977,MDCCLXXXIV.,Quam quae severis ludicra jungere
2978,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Novit, fatigatamque nugis"
2979,MDCCLXXXIV.,Utilibus recreare mentem.
2980,MDCCLXXXIV.,
2981,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Texente nymphis serta Lycoride,"
2982,MDCCLXXXIV.,Rosae ruborem sic viola adjuvat
2983,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Iramista, sic Iris refulget"
2984,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Aethereis variata fucis."""
2985,MDCCLXXXIV.,
2986,MDCCLXXXIV.,"It is remarkable, that the pomp of diction, which has been objected to"
2987,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Johnson, was first assumed in the Rambler. His Dictionary was going on"
2988,MDCCLXXXIV.,"at the same time, and, in the course of that work, as he grew familiar"
2989,MDCCLXXXIV.,"with technical and scholastic words, he thought that the bulk of his"
2990,MDCCLXXXIV.,"readers were equally learned; or, at least, would admire the splendour"
2991,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and dignity of the style. And yet it is well known, that he praised, in"
2992,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Cowley, the ease and unaffected structure of the sentences. Cowley may"
2993,MDCCLXXXIV.,be placed at the head of those who cultivated a clear and natural style.
2994,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Dryden, Tillotson, and sir William Temple followed. Addison, Swift, and"
2995,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Pope, with more correctness, carried our language well nigh to"
2996,MDCCLXXXIV.,"perfection. Of Addison, Johnson was used to say, ""he is the Raphael of"
2997,MDCCLXXXIV.,"essay writers."" How he differed so widely from such elegant models, is a"
2998,MDCCLXXXIV.,"problem not to be solved, unless it be true, that he took an early"
2999,MDCCLXXXIV.,"tincture from the writers of the last century, particularly sir Thomas"
3000,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Browne. Hence the peculiarities of his style, new combinations,"
3001,MDCCLXXXIV.,"sentences of an unusual structure, and words derived from the learned"
3002,MDCCLXXXIV.,"languages. His own account of the matter is: ""When common words were"
3003,MDCCLXXXIV.,"less pleasing to the ear, or less distinct in their signification, I"
3004,MDCCLXXXIV.,"familiarized the terms of philosophy, by applying them to popular"
3005,MDCCLXXXIV.,"ideas."" But he forgot the observation of Dryden: ""If too many foreign"
3006,MDCCLXXXIV.,"words are poured in upon us, it looks, as if they were designed, not to"
3007,MDCCLXXXIV.,"assist the natives, but to conquer them."" There is, it must be admitted,"
3008,MDCCLXXXIV.,"a swell of language, often out of all proportion to the sentiment; but"
3009,MDCCLXXXIV.,"there is, in general, a fulness of mind, and the thought seems to expand"
3010,MDCCLXXXIV.,with the sound of the words. Determined to discard colloquial barbarisms
3011,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and licentious idioms, he forgot the elegant simplicity that"
3012,MDCCLXXXIV.,"distinguishes the writings of Addison. He had, what Locke calls, a"
3013,MDCCLXXXIV.,"round-about view of his subject; and, though he never was tainted, like"
3014,MDCCLXXXIV.,"many modern wits, with the ambition of shining in paradox, he may be"
3015,MDCCLXXXIV.,fairly called an original thinker. His reading was extensive. He
3016,MDCCLXXXIV.,"treasured in his mind whatever was worthy of notice, but he added to it"
3017,MDCCLXXXIV.,"from his own meditation. He collected, ""quae reconderet, auetaque"
3018,MDCCLXXXIV.,"promeret."" Addison was not so profound a thinker. He was ""born to write,"
3019,MDCCLXXXIV.,"converse, and live with ease;"" and he found an early patron in lord"
3020,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Somers. He depended, however, more upon a fine taste than the vigour of"
3021,MDCCLXXXIV.,"his mind. His Latin poetry shows, that he relished, with a just"
3022,MDCCLXXXIV.,"selection, all the refined and delicate beauties of the Roman classics;"
3023,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and, when he cultivated his native language, no wonder that he formed"
3024,MDCCLXXXIV.,"that graceful style, which has been so justly admired; simple, yet"
3025,MDCCLXXXIV.,"elegant; adorned, yet never over-wrought; rich in allusion, yet pure and"
3026,MDCCLXXXIV.,"perspicuous; correct, without labour; and though, sometimes, deficient"
3027,MDCCLXXXIV.,"in strength, yet always musical. His essays, in general, are on the"
3028,MDCCLXXXIV.,"surface of life; if ever original, it was in pieces of humour. Sir Roger"
3029,MDCCLXXXIV.,"de Coverly, and the tory fox-hunter, need not to be mentioned. Johnson"
3030,MDCCLXXXIV.,"had a fund of humour, but he did not know it; nor was he willing to"
3031,MDCCLXXXIV.,"descend to the familiar idiom, and the variety of diction, which that"
3032,MDCCLXXXIV.,"mode of composition required. The letter, in the Rambler, No. 12, from a"
3033,MDCCLXXXIV.,"young girl that wants a place, will illustrate this observation. Addison"
3034,MDCCLXXXIV.,"possessed an unclouded imagination, alive to the first objects of nature"
3035,MDCCLXXXIV.,and of art. He reaches the sublime without any apparent effort. When he
3036,MDCCLXXXIV.,"tells us, ""If we consider the fixed stars as so many oceans of flame,"
3037,MDCCLXXXIV.,that are each of them attended with a different set of planets; if we
3038,MDCCLXXXIV.,"still discover new firmaments, and new lights, that are sunk further in"
3039,MDCCLXXXIV.,those unfathomable depths of ether; we are lost in a labyrinth of suns
3040,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and worlds, and confounded with the magnificence and immensity of"
3041,MDCCLXXXIV.,"nature;"" the ease, with which this passage rises to unaffected grandeur,"
3042,MDCCLXXXIV.,is the secret charm that captivates the reader. Johnson is always lofty;
3043,MDCCLXXXIV.,"he seems, to use Dryden's phrase, to be ""o'erinform'd with meaning,"" and"
3044,MDCCLXXXIV.,his words do not appear to himself adequate to his conception. He moves
3045,MDCCLXXXIV.,"in state, and his periods are always harmonious. His Oriental Tales are"
3046,MDCCLXXXIV.,"in the true style of eastern magnificence, and yet none of them are so"
3047,MDCCLXXXIV.,"much admired, as the Visions of Mirza. In matters of criticism, Johnson"
3048,MDCCLXXXIV.,"is never the echo of preceding writers. He thinks, and decides, for"
3049,MDCCLXXXIV.,"himself. If we except the essays on the Pleasures of Imagination,"
3050,MDCCLXXXIV.,Addison cannot be called a philosophical critic. His moral essays are
3051,MDCCLXXXIV.,"beautiful; but in that province nothing can exceed the Rambler, though"
3052,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Johnson used to say, that the essay on ""the burthens of mankind,"" (in"
3053,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the Spectator, No. 558,) was the most exquisite he had ever read."
3054,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Talking of himself, Johnson said, ""Topham Beauclerk has wit, and every"
3055,MDCCLXXXIV.,"thing comes from him with ease; but when I say a good thing, I seem to"
3056,MDCCLXXXIV.,"labour."" When we compare him with Addison, the contrast is still"
3057,MDCCLXXXIV.,stronger: Addison lends grace and ornament to truth; Johnson gives it
3058,MDCCLXXXIV.,force and energy. Addison makes virtue amiable; Johnson represents it as
3059,MDCCLXXXIV.,an awful duty: Addison insinuates himself with an air of modesty;
3060,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Johnson commands like a dictator; but a dictator in his splendid robes,"
3061,MDCCLXXXIV.,"not labouring at the plough: Addison is the Jupiter of Virgil, with"
3062,MDCCLXXXIV.,"placid serenity talking to Venus,"
3063,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3064,MDCCLXXXIV.,"""Vultu, quo coelum tempestatesque serenat."""
3065,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3066,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Johnson is Jupiter Tonans: he darts his lightning and rolls his thunder,"
3067,MDCCLXXXIV.,in the cause of virtue and piety. The language seems to fall short of
3068,MDCCLXXXIV.,"his ideas; he pours along, familiarizing the terms of philosophy, with"
3069,MDCCLXXXIV.,"bold inversions, and sonorous periods; but we may apply to him, what"
3070,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Pope has said of Homer: ""It is the sentiment that swells and fills out"
3071,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the diction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it: like glass"
3072,MDCCLXXXIV.,"in the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, as the breath within"
3073,MDCCLXXXIV.,"is more powerful, and the heat more intense."""
3074,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3075,MDCCLXXXIV.,It is not the design of this comparison to decide between these two
3076,MDCCLXXXIV.,eminent writers. In matters of taste every reader will choose for
3077,MDCCLXXXIV.,"himself. Johnson is always profound, and, of course, gives the fatigue"
3078,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of thinking. Addison charms, while he instructs; and writing, as he"
3079,MDCCLXXXIV.,"always does, a pure, an elegant, and idiomatic style, he may be"
3080,MDCCLXXXIV.,pronounced the safest model for imitation.
3081,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3082,MDCCLXXXIV.,"The essays written by Johnson in the Adventurer, may be called a"
3083,MDCCLXXXIV.,"continuation of the Rambler. The Idler, in order to be consistent with"
3084,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the assumed character, is written with abated vigour, in a style of ease"
3085,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and unlaboured elegance. It is the Odyssey, after the Iliad. Intense"
3086,MDCCLXXXIV.,thinking would not become the Idler. The first number presents a well-drawn
3087,MDCCLXXXIV.,"portrait of an Idler, and from that character no deviation could"
3088,MDCCLXXXIV.,"be made. Accordingly, Johnson forgets his austere manner, and plays us"
3089,MDCCLXXXIV.,"into sense. He still continues his lectures on human life, but he"
3090,MDCCLXXXIV.,"adverts to common occurrences, and is often content with the topic of"
3091,MDCCLXXXIV.,the day. An advertisement in the beginning of the first volume informs
3092,MDCCLXXXIV.,"us, that twelve entire essays were a contribution from different hands."
3093,MDCCLXXXIV.,"One of these, No. 33, is the journal of a senior fellow, at Cambridge,"
3094,MDCCLXXXIV.,"but, as Johnson, being himself an original thinker, always revolted from"
3095,MDCCLXXXIV.,"servile imitation, he has printed the piece with an apology, importing,"
3096,MDCCLXXXIV.,"that the journal of a citizen, in the Spectator, almost precluded the"
3097,MDCCLXXXIV.,attempt of any subsequent writer. This account of the Idler may be
3098,MDCCLXXXIV.,"closed, after observing, that the author's mother being buried on the"
3099,MDCCLXXXIV.,"23rd of January, 1759, there is an admirable paper occasioned by that"
3100,MDCCLXXXIV.,"event, on Saturday, the 27th of the same month, No. 41. The reader, if"
3101,MDCCLXXXIV.,"he pleases, may compare it with another fine paper in the Rambler, No."
3102,MDCCLXXXIV.,"54, on the conviction that rushes on the mind at the bed of a dying"
3103,MDCCLXXXIV.,friend.
3104,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3105,MDCCLXXXIV.,"""Rasselas,"" says sir John Hawkins, ""is a specimen of our language"
3106,MDCCLXXXIV.,scarcely to be paralleled; it is written in a style refined to a degree
3107,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of immaculate purity, and displays the whole force of turgid eloquence."""
3108,MDCCLXXXIV.,"One cannot but smile at this encomium. Rasselas, is, undoubtedly, both"
3109,MDCCLXXXIV.,"elegant and sublime. It is a view of human life, displayed, it must be"
3110,MDCCLXXXIV.,"owned, in gloomy colours. The author's natural melancholy, depressed, at"
3111,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the time, by the approaching dissolution of his mother, darkened the"
3112,MDCCLXXXIV.,"picture. A tale, that should keep curiosity awake by the artifice of"
3113,MDCCLXXXIV.,"unexpected incidents, was not the design of a mind pregnant with better"
3114,MDCCLXXXIV.,"things. He, who reads the heads of the chapters, will find, that it is"
3115,MDCCLXXXIV.,"not a course of adventures that invites him forward, but a discussion of"
3116,MDCCLXXXIV.,"interesting questions; reflections on human life; the history of Imlac,"
3117,MDCCLXXXIV.,the man of learning; a dissertation upon poetry; the character of a wise
3118,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and happy man, who discourses, with energy, on the government of the"
3119,MDCCLXXXIV.,"passions, and, on a sudden, when death deprives him of his daughter,"
3120,MDCCLXXXIV.,"forgets all his maxims of wisdom, and the eloquence that adorned them,"
3121,MDCCLXXXIV.,"yielding to the stroke of affliction, with all the vehemence of the"
3122,MDCCLXXXIV.,"bitterest anguish. It is by pictures of life, and profound moral"
3123,MDCCLXXXIV.,"reflection, that expectation is engaged, and gratified throughout the"
3124,MDCCLXXXIV.,"work. The history of the mad astronomer, who imagines that, for five"
3125,MDCCLXXXIV.,"years, he possessed the regulation of the weather, and that the sun"
3126,MDCCLXXXIV.,"passed, from tropic to tropic, by his direction, represents, in striking"
3127,MDCCLXXXIV.,"colours, the sad effects of a distempered imagination. It becomes the"
3128,MDCCLXXXIV.,"more affecting when we recollect, that it proceeds from one who lived in"
3129,MDCCLXXXIV.,fear of the same dreadful visitation; from one who says emphatically:
3130,MDCCLXXXIV.,"""Of the uncertainties in our present state, the most dreadful and"
3131,MDCCLXXXIV.,"alarming is the uncertain continuance of reason."" The inquiry into the"
3132,MDCCLXXXIV.,"cause of madness, and the dangerous prevalence of imagination, till, in"
3133,MDCCLXXXIV.,"time, some particular train of ideas fixes the attention, and the mind"
3134,MDCCLXXXIV.,"recurs constantly to the favourite conception, is carried on in a strain"
3135,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of acute observation; but it leaves us room to think, that the author"
3136,MDCCLXXXIV.,was transcribing from his own apprehensions. The discourse on the nature
3137,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of the soul, gives us all that philosophy knows, not without a tincture"
3138,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of superstition. It is remarkable, that the vanity of human pursuits"
3139,MDCCLXXXIV.,"was, about the same time, the subject that employed both Johnson and"
3140,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Voltaire; but Candide is the work of a lively imagination; and Rasselas,"
3141,MDCCLXXXIV.,"with all its splendour of eloquence, exhibits a gloomy picture. It"
3142,MDCCLXXXIV.,"should, however, be remembered, that the world has known the weeping, as"
3143,MDCCLXXXIV.,well as the laughing philosopher.
3144,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3145,MDCCLXXXIV.,The Dictionary does not properly fall within the province of this essay.
3146,MDCCLXXXIV.,"The preface, however, will be found in this edition. He who reads the"
3147,MDCCLXXXIV.,"close of it, without acknowledging the force of the pathethic and"
3148,MDCCLXXXIV.,"sublime, must have more insensibility in his composition, than usually"
3149,MDCCLXXXIV.,"falls to the share of a man. The work itself, though, in some instances,"
3150,MDCCLXXXIV.,"abuse has been loud, and, in others, malice has endeavoured to undermine"
3151,MDCCLXXXIV.,"its fame, still remains the MOUNT ATLAS of English literature."
3152,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3153,MDCCLXXXIV.,"""Though storms and tempests thunder on its brow,"
3154,MDCCLXXXIV.,"And oceans break their billows at its feet,"
3155,MDCCLXXXIV.,"It stands unmov'd, and glories in its height."""
3156,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3157,MDCCLXXXIV.,That Johnson was eminently qualified for the office of a commentator on
3158,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Shakespeare, no man can doubt; but it was an office which he never"
3159,MDCCLXXXIV.,cordially embraced. The public expected more than he had diligence to
3160,MDCCLXXXIV.,"perform; and yet his edition has been the ground, on which every"
3161,MDCCLXXXIV.,"subsequent commentator has chosen to build. One note, for its"
3162,MDCCLXXXIV.,"singularity, may be thought worthy of notice in this place. Hamlet says,"
3163,MDCCLXXXIV.,"""For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god-kissing"
3164,MDCCLXXXIV.,"carrion."" In this Warburton discovered the origin of evil. Hamlet, he"
3165,MDCCLXXXIV.,"says, breaks off in the middle of the sentence; but the learned"
3166,MDCCLXXXIV.,"commentator knows what he was going to say, and, being unwilling to keep"
3167,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the secret, he goes on in a train of philosophical reasoning, that"
3168,MDCCLXXXIV.,"leaves the reader in astonishment. Johnson, with true piety, adopts the"
3169,MDCCLXXXIV.,"fanciful hypothesis, declaring it to be a noble emendation, which almost"
3170,MDCCLXXXIV.,sets the critic on a level with the author. The general observations at
3171,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the end of the several plays, and the preface, will be found in this"
3172,MDCCLXXXIV.,"edition. The former, with great elegance and precision, give a summary"
3173,MDCCLXXXIV.,view of each drama. The preface is a tract of great erudition and
3174,MDCCLXXXIV.,philosophical criticism.
3175,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3176,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Johnson's political pamphlets, whatever was his motive for writing them,"
3177,MDCCLXXXIV.,"whether gratitude for his pension, or the solicitation of men in power,"
3178,MDCCLXXXIV.,did not support the cause for which they were undertaken. They are
3179,MDCCLXXXIV.,"written in a style truly harmonious, and with his usual dignity of"
3180,MDCCLXXXIV.,language. When it is said that he advanced positions repugnant to the
3181,MDCCLXXXIV.,"""common rights of mankind,"" the virulence of party may be suspected. It"
3182,MDCCLXXXIV.,"is, perhaps, true, that in the clamour, raised throughout the kingdom,"
3183,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Johnson overheated his mind; but he was a friend to the rights of man,"
3184,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and he was greatly superior to the littleness of spirit, that might"
3185,MDCCLXXXIV.,incline him to advance what he did not think and firmly believe. In the
3186,MDCCLXXXIV.,"False Alarm, though many of the most eminent men in the kingdom"
3187,MDCCLXXXIV.,"concurred in petitions to the throne, yet Johnson, having well surveyed"
3188,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the mass of the people, has given, with great humour, and no less truth,"
3189,MDCCLXXXIV.,"what may be called, ""the birth, parentage, and education of a"
3190,MDCCLXXXIV.,"remonstrance."" On the subject of Falkland's islands, the fine dissuasive"
3191,MDCCLXXXIV.,"from too hastily involving the world in the calamities of war, must"
3192,MDCCLXXXIV.,"extort applause even from the party that wished, at that time, for"
3193,MDCCLXXXIV.,"scenes of tumult and commotion. It was in the same pamphlet, that"
3194,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Johnson offered battle to Junius, a writer, who, by the uncommon"
3195,MDCCLXXXIV.,"elegance of his style, charmed every reader, though his object was to"
3196,MDCCLXXXIV.,inflame the nation in favour of a faction. Junius fought in the dark; he
3197,MDCCLXXXIV.,"saw his enemy, and had his full blow; while he himself remained safe in"
3198,MDCCLXXXIV.,"obscurity. ""But let us not,"" said Johnson, ""mistake the venom of the"
3199,MDCCLXXXIV.,"shaft, for the vigour of the bow."" The keen invective which he"
3200,MDCCLXXXIV.,"published, on that occasion, promised a paper war between two"
3201,MDCCLXXXIV.,"combatants, who knew the use of their weapons. A battle between them was"
3202,MDCCLXXXIV.,"as eagerly expected, as between Mendoza and Big Ben. But Junius,"
3203,MDCCLXXXIV.,"whatever was his reason, never returned to the field. He laid down his"
3204,MDCCLXXXIV.,"arms, and has, ever since, remained as secret as the man in the mask, in"
3205,MDCCLXXXIV.,Voltaire's history.
3206,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3207,MDCCLXXXIV.,"The account of his journey to the Hebrides, or western isles of"
3208,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Scotland, is a model for such as shall, hereafter, relate their travels."
3209,MDCCLXXXIV.,The author did not visit that part of the world in the character of an
3210,MDCCLXXXIV.,"antiquary, to amuse us with wonders taken from the dark and fabulous"
3211,MDCCLXXXIV.,"ages; nor, as a mathematician, to measure a degree, and settle the"
3212,MDCCLXXXIV.,"longitude and latitude of the several islands. Those, who expected such"
3213,MDCCLXXXIV.,"information, expected what was never intended. ""In every work regard the"
3214,MDCCLXXXIV.,"writer's end."" Johnson went to see men and manners, modes of life, and"
3215,MDCCLXXXIV.,the progress of civilization. His remarks are so artfully blended with
3216,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the rapidity and elegance of his narrative, that the reader is inclined"
3217,MDCCLXXXIV.,"to wish, as Johnson did, with regard to Gray, that ""to travel, and to"
3218,MDCCLXXXIV.,"tell his travels, had been more of his employment."""
3219,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3220,MDCCLXXXIV.,"As to Johnson's Parliamentary Debates, nothing, with propriety, can be"
3221,MDCCLXXXIV.,"said in this place. They are collected, in two volumes, by Mr."
3222,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Stockdale, and the flow of eloquence which runs through the several"
3223,MDCCLXXXIV.,"speeches, is sufficiently known."
3224,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3225,MDCCLXXXIV.,"It will not be useless to mention two more volumes, which may form a"
3226,MDCCLXXXIV.,"proper supplement to this edition. They contain a set of sermons, left"
3227,MDCCLXXXIV.,"for publication by John Taylor, LL.D. The reverend Mr. Hayes, who"
3228,MDCCLXXXIV.,"ushered these discourses into the world, has not given them, as the"
3229,MDCCLXXXIV.,"composition of Dr. Taylor. All he could say for his departed friend was,"
3230,MDCCLXXXIV.,"that he left them, in silence, among his papers. Mr. Hayes knew them to"
3231,MDCCLXXXIV.,be the production of a superior mind; and the writer of these memoirs
3232,MDCCLXXXIV.,"owes it to the candour of that elegant scholar, that he is now warranted"
3233,MDCCLXXXIV.,"to give an additional proof of Johnson's ardour in the cause of piety,"
3234,MDCCLXXXIV.,and every moral duty. The last discourse in the collection was intended
3235,MDCCLXXXIV.,"to be delivered by Dr. Taylor, at the funeral of Johnson's wife; but"
3236,MDCCLXXXIV.,"that reverend gentleman declined the office, because, as he told Mr."
3237,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Hayes, the praise of the deceased was too much amplified. He, who reads"
3238,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the piece, will find it a beautiful moral lesson, written with temper,"
3239,MDCCLXXXIV.,and nowhere overcharged with ambitious ornaments. The rest of the
3240,MDCCLXXXIV.,"discourses were the fund, which Dr. Taylor, from time to time, carried"
3241,MDCCLXXXIV.,"with him to his pulpit. He had the _largest bull_[dd] in England, and"
3242,MDCCLXXXIV.,some of the best sermons.
3243,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3244,MDCCLXXXIV.,"We come now to the Lives of the Poets, a work undertaken at the age of"
3245,MDCCLXXXIV.,"seventy, yet, the most brilliant, and, certainly, the most popular, of"
3246,MDCCLXXXIV.,all our author's writings. For this performance he needed little
3247,MDCCLXXXIV.,"preparation. Attentive always to the history of letters, and, by his own"
3248,MDCCLXXXIV.,"natural bias, fond of biography, he was the more willing to embrace the"
3249,MDCCLXXXIV.,proposition of the booksellers. He was versed in the whole body of
3250,MDCCLXXXIV.,"English poetry, and his rules of criticism were settled with precision."
3251,MDCCLXXXIV.,"The dissertation, in the life of Cowley, on the metaphysical poets of"
3252,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the last century, has the attraction of novelty, as well as sound"
3253,MDCCLXXXIV.,"observation. The writers, who followed Dr. Donne, went in quest of"
3254,MDCCLXXXIV.,"something better than truth and nature. As Sancho says, in Don Quixote,"
3255,MDCCLXXXIV.,they wanted better bread than is made with wheat. They took pains to
3256,MDCCLXXXIV.,"bewilder themselves, and were ingenious for no other purpose than to"
3257,MDCCLXXXIV.,"err. In Johnson's review of Cowley's works, false wit is detected in all"
3258,MDCCLXXXIV.,"its shapes, and the Gothic taste for glittering conceits, and far-fetched"
3259,MDCCLXXXIV.,"allusions, is exploded, never, it is hoped, to revive again."
3260,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3261,MDCCLXXXIV.,An author who has published his observations on the Life and Writings of
3262,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Dr. Johnson, speaking of the Lives of the Poets, says, ""These"
3263,MDCCLXXXIV.,"compositions, abounding in strong and acute remark, and with many fine,"
3264,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and even sublime, passages, have, unquestionably, great merit; but, if"
3265,MDCCLXXXIV.,"they be regarded, merely as containing narrations of the lives,"
3266,MDCCLXXXIV.,"delineations of the characters, and strictures of the several authors,"
3267,MDCCLXXXIV.,"they are far from being always to be depended on."" He adds: ""The"
3268,MDCCLXXXIV.,"characters are sometimes partial, and there is, sometimes, too much"
3269,MDCCLXXXIV.,"malignity of misrepresentation, to which, perhaps, may be joined no"
3270,MDCCLXXXIV.,"inconsiderable portion of erroneous criticism."" The several clauses of"
3271,MDCCLXXXIV.,"this censure deserve to be answered, as fully as the limits of this"
3272,MDCCLXXXIV.,essay will permit.
3273,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3274,MDCCLXXXIV.,"In the first place, the facts are related upon the best intelligence,"
3275,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and the best vouchers that could be gleaned, after a great lapse of"
3276,MDCCLXXXIV.,"time. Probability was to be inferred from such materials, as could be"
3277,MDCCLXXXIV.,"procured, and no man better understood the nature of historical evidence"
3278,MDCCLXXXIV.,than Dr. Johnson; no man was more religiously an observer of truth. If
3279,MDCCLXXXIV.,"his history is any where defective, it must be imputed to the want of"
3280,MDCCLXXXIV.,"better information, and the errors of uncertain tradition."
3281,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3282,MDCCLXXXIV.,"""Ad nos vix tenuis famae perlabitur aura."""
3283,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3284,MDCCLXXXIV.,If the strictures on the works of the various authors are not always
3285,MDCCLXXXIV.,"satisfactory, and if erroneous criticism may sometimes be suspected, who"
3286,MDCCLXXXIV.,"can hope, that in matters of taste, all shall agree?  The instances, in"
3287,MDCCLXXXIV.,"which the public mind has differed, from the positions advanced by the"
3288,MDCCLXXXIV.,"author, are few in number. It has been said, that justice has not been"
3289,MDCCLXXXIV.,done to Swift; that Gay and Prior are undervalued; and that Gray has
3290,MDCCLXXXIV.,"been harshly treated. This charge, perhaps, ought not to be disputed."
3291,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Johnson, it is well known, had conceived a prejudice against Swift. His"
3292,MDCCLXXXIV.,"friends trembled for him, when he was writing that life, but were"
3293,MDCCLXXXIV.,"pleased, at last, to see it executed with temper and moderation. As to"
3294,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Prior, it is probable that he gave his real opinion, but an opinion that"
3295,MDCCLXXXIV.,"will not be adopted by men of lively fancy. With regard to Gray, when he"
3296,MDCCLXXXIV.,"condemns the apostrophe, in which father Thames is desired to tell who"
3297,MDCCLXXXIV.,"drives the hoop, or tosses the ball, and then adds, that father Thames"
3298,MDCCLXXXIV.,had no better means of knowing than himself; when he compares the abrupt
3299,MDCCLXXXIV.,"beginning of the first stanza of the bard, to the ballad of Johnny"
3300,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Armstrong, ""Is there ever a man in all Scotland;"" there are, perhaps,"
3301,MDCCLXXXIV.,"few friends of Johnson, who would not wish to blot out both the"
3302,MDCCLXXXIV.,passages.
3303,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3304,MDCCLXXXIV.,"It may be questioned, whether the remarks on Pope's Essay on Man can be"
3305,MDCCLXXXIV.,"received, without great caution. It has been already mentioned, that"
3306,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Crousaz, a professor in Switzerland, eminent for his Treatise of Logic,"
3307,MDCCLXXXIV.,"started up a professed enemy to that poem. Johnson says, ""his mind was"
3308,MDCCLXXXIV.,"one of those, in which philosophy and piety are happily united. He"
3309,MDCCLXXXIV.,"looked, with distrust, upon all metaphysical systems of theology, and"
3310,MDCCLXXXIV.,"was persuaded, that the positions of Pope were intended to draw mankind"
3311,MDCCLXXXIV.,"away from revelation, and to represent the whole course of things, as a"
3312,MDCCLXXXIV.,"necessary concatenation of indissoluble fatality."" This is not the place"
3313,MDCCLXXXIV.,"fur a controversy about the Leibnitzian system. Warburton, with all the"
3314,MDCCLXXXIV.,"powers of his large and comprehensive mind, published a vindication of"
3315,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Pope; and yet Johnson says, that, ""in many passages, a religious eye may"
3316,MDCCLXXXIV.,"easily discover expressions not very favourable to morals, or to"
3317,MDCCLXXXIV.,"liberty."" This sentence is severe, and, perhaps, dogmatical. Crousaz"
3318,MDCCLXXXIV.,"wrote an Examen of the Essay on Man, and, afterwards, a commentary on"
3319,MDCCLXXXIV.,"every remarkable passage; and, though it now appears, that Mrs."
3320,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Elizabeth Carter translated the foreign critic, yet it is certain, that"
3321,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Johnson encouraged the work, and, perhaps, imbibed those early"
3322,MDCCLXXXIV.,"prejudices, which adhered to him to the end of his life. He shuddered at"
3323,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the idea of irreligion. Hence, we are told, in the life of Pope, ""Never"
3324,MDCCLXXXIV.,"were penury of knowledge, and vulgarity of sentiment, so happily"
3325,MDCCLXXXIV.,"disguised; Pope, in the chair of wisdom, tells much that every man"
3326,MDCCLXXXIV.,"knows, and much that he did not know himself; and gives us comfort in"
3327,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the position, that though man's a fool, yet God is wise; that human"
3328,MDCCLXXXIV.,"advantages are unstable; that our true honour is, not to have a great"
3329,MDCCLXXXIV.,"part, but to act it well; that virtue only is our own, and that"
3330,MDCCLXXXIV.,"happiness is always in our power."" The reader, when he meets all this in"
3331,MDCCLXXXIV.,"its new array, no longer knows the talk of his mother and his nurse."
3332,MDCCLXXXIV.,"But, may it not be said, that every system of ethics must, or ought, to"
3333,MDCCLXXXIV.,"terminate, in plain and general maxims for the use of life? and, though"
3334,MDCCLXXXIV.,"in such anxioms no discovery is made, does not the beauty of the moral"
3335,MDCCLXXXIV.,"theory consist in the premises, and the chain of reasoning that leads to"
3336,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the conclusion? May not truth, as Johnson himself says, be conveyed to"
3337,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the mind by a new train of intermediate images? Pope's doctrine, about"
3338,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the ruling passion, does not seem to be refuted, though it is called, in"
3339,MDCCLXXXIV.,"harsh terms, pernicious, as well as false, tending to establish a kind"
3340,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of moral predestination, or overruling principle, which cannot be"
3341,MDCCLXXXIV.,resisted. But Johnson was too easily alarmed in the cause of religion.
3342,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Organized as the human race is, individuals have different inlets of"
3343,MDCCLXXXIV.,"perception, different powers of mind, and different sensations of"
3344,MDCCLXXXIV.,pleasure and pain.
3345,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3346,MDCCLXXXIV.,"""All spread their charms, but charm not all alike,"
3347,MDCCLXXXIV.,On different senses different objects strike:
3348,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Hence different passions more or less inflame,"
3349,MDCCLXXXIV.,As strong or weak the organs of the frame.
3350,MDCCLXXXIV.,"And hence one master-passion in the breast,"
3351,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Like Aaron's serpent, swallows up the rest."""
3352,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3353,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Brumoy says, Pascal, from his infancy, felt himself a geometrician; and"
3354,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Vandyke, in like manner, was a painter. Shakespeare, who, of all poets,"
3355,MDCCLXXXIV.,"had the deepest insight into human nature, was aware of a prevailing"
3356,MDCCLXXXIV.,"bias in the operations of every mind. By him we are told, ""Masterless"
3357,MDCCLXXXIV.,"passion sways us to the mood of what it likes or loathes."""
3358,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3359,MDCCLXXXIV.,"It remains to inquire, whether, in the lives before us, the characters"
3360,MDCCLXXXIV.,"are partial, and too often drawn with malignity of misrepresentation? To"
3361,MDCCLXXXIV.,"prove this, it is alleged, that Johnson has misrepresented the"
3362,MDCCLXXXIV.,"circumstances relative to the translation of the first Iliad, and"
3363,MDCCLXXXIV.,"maliciously ascribed that performance to Addison, instead of Tickell,"
3364,MDCCLXXXIV.,"with too much reliance on the testimony of Pope, taken from the account"
3365,MDCCLXXXIV.,in the papers left by Mr. Spence. For a refutation of the fallacy
3366,MDCCLXXXIV.,"imputed to Addison, we are referred to a note in the Biographia"
3367,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Britannica, written by the late judge Blackstone, who, it is said,"
3368,MDCCLXXXIV.,"examined the whole matter with accuracy, and found, that the first"
3369,MDCCLXXXIV.,"regular statement of the accusation against Addison, was published by"
3370,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Ruffhead, in his life of Pope, from the materials which he received from"
3371,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Dr. Warburton. But, with all due deference to the learned judge, whose"
3372,MDCCLXXXIV.,"talents deserve all praise, this account is by no means accurate."
3373,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3374,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Sir Richard Steele, in a dedication of the comedy of the Drummer, to Mr."
3375,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Congreve, gave the first insight into that business. He says, in a style"
3376,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of anger and resentment: ""If that gentleman (Mr. Tickell) thinks himself"
3377,MDCCLXXXIV.,"injured, I will allow I have wronged him upon this issue, that, if the"
3378,MDCCLXXXIV.,reputed translator of the first book of Homer shall please to give us
3379,MDCCLXXXIV.,"another book, there shall appear another good judge in poetry, besides"
3380,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Mr. Alexander Pope, who shall like it."" The authority of Steele"
3381,MDCCLXXXIV.,"outweighs all opinions, founded on vain conjecture, and, indeed, seems"
3382,MDCCLXXXIV.,"to be decisive, since we do not find that Tickell, though warmly"
3383,MDCCLXXXIV.,"pressed, thought proper to vindicate himself."
3384,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3385,MDCCLXXXIV.,"But the grand proof of Johnson's malignity, is the manner in which he"
3386,MDCCLXXXIV.,has treated the character and conduct of Milton. To enforce this charge
3387,MDCCLXXXIV.,"has wearied sophistry, and exhausted the invention of a party. What they"
3388,MDCCLXXXIV.,"cannot deny, they palliate; what they cannot prove, they say is"
3389,MDCCLXXXIV.,"probable. But why all this rage against Dr. Johnson? Addison, before"
3390,MDCCLXXXIV.,"him, had said of Milton:"
3391,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3392,MDCCLXXXIV.,"""Oh! had the poet ne'er profan'd his pen,"
3393,MDCCLXXXIV.,"To varnish o'er the guilt of faithless men!"""
3394,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3395,MDCCLXXXIV.,And had not Johnson an equal right to avow his sentiments? Do his
3396,MDCCLXXXIV.,"enemies claim a privilege to abuse whatever is valuable to Englishmen,"
3397,MDCCLXXXIV.,either in church or state? and must the liberty of unlicensed printing
3398,MDCCLXXXIV.,be denied to the friends of the British constitution?
3399,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3400,MDCCLXXXIV.,"It is unnecessary to pursue the argument through all its artifices,"
3401,MDCCLXXXIV.,"since, dismantled of ornament and seducing language, the plain truth may"
3402,MDCCLXXXIV.,be stated in a narrow compass. Johnson knew that Milton was a
3403,MDCCLXXXIV.,"republican: he says, ""an acrimonious and surly republican, for which it"
3404,MDCCLXXXIV.,"is not known that he gave any better reason than, that a popular"
3405,MDCCLXXXIV.,government was the most frugal; for the trappings of a monarchy would
3406,MDCCLXXXIV.,"set up an ordinary commonwealth."" Johnson knew that Milton talked aloud"
3407,MDCCLXXXIV.,"""of the danger of readmitting kingship in this nation;"" and when Milton"
3408,MDCCLXXXIV.,"adds, ""that a commonwealth was commended, or rather enjoined, by our"
3409,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Saviour himself, to all christians, not without a remarkable"
3410,MDCCLXXXIV.,"disallowance, and the brand of gentilism upon kingship,"" Johnson thought"
3411,MDCCLXXXIV.,"him no better than a wild enthusiast. He knew, as well as Milton, ""that"
3412,MDCCLXXXIV.,the happiness of a nation must needs be firmest and certainest in a full
3413,MDCCLXXXIV.,"and free council of their own electing, where no single person, but"
3414,MDCCLXXXIV.,"reason only, sways;"" but the example of all the republicks, recorded in"
3415,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the annals of mankind, gave him no room to hope, that reason only would"
3416,MDCCLXXXIV.,"be heard. He knew, that the republican form of government, having little"
3417,MDCCLXXXIV.,"or no complication, and no consonance of parts, by a nice mechanism"
3418,MDCCLXXXIV.,"forming a regular whole, was too simple to be beautiful, even in theory."
3419,MDCCLXXXIV.,"In practice it, perhaps, never existed. In its most flourishing state,"
3420,MDCCLXXXIV.,"at Athens, Rome, and Carthage, it was a constant scene of tumult and"
3421,MDCCLXXXIV.,"commotion. From the mischiefs of a wild democracy, the progress has ever"
3422,MDCCLXXXIV.,"been to the dominion of an aristocracy; and the word aristocracy,"
3423,MDCCLXXXIV.,"fatally includes the boldest and most turbulent citizens, who rise by"
3424,MDCCLXXXIV.,"their crimes, and call themselves the best men in the state. By"
3425,MDCCLXXXIV.,"intrigue, by cabal, and faction, a pernicious oligarchy is sure to"
3426,MDCCLXXXIV.,"succeed, and end, at last, in the tyranny of a single ruler. Tacitus,"
3427,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the great master of political wisdom, saw, under the mixed authority of"
3428,MDCCLXXXIV.,"king, nobles, and people, a better form of government than Milton's"
3429,MDCCLXXXIV.,"boasted republick; and what Tacitus admired in theory, but despaired of"
3430,MDCCLXXXIV.,"enjoying, Johnson saw established in this country. He knew that it had"
3431,MDCCLXXXIV.,"been overturned by the rage of frantic men; but he knew that, after the"
3432,MDCCLXXXIV.,"iron rod of Cromwell's usurpation, the constitution was once more"
3433,MDCCLXXXIV.,"restored to its first principles. Monarchy was established, and this"
3434,MDCCLXXXIV.,"country was regenerated. It was regenerated a second time, at the"
3435,MDCCLXXXIV.,"revolution: the rights of men were then defined, and the blessings of"
3436,MDCCLXXXIV.,"good order, and civil liberty, have been ever since diffused through the"
3437,MDCCLXXXIV.,whole community.
3438,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3439,MDCCLXXXIV.,The peace and happiness of society were what Dr. Johnson had at heart.
3440,MDCCLXXXIV.,"He knew that Milton called his defence of the regicides, a defence of"
3441,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the people of England; but, however glossed and varnished, he thought it"
3442,MDCCLXXXIV.,"an apology for murder. Had the men, who, under a show of liberty,"
3443,MDCCLXXXIV.,"brought their king to the scaffold, proved, by their subsequent conduct,"
3444,MDCCLXXXIV.,"that the public good inspired their actions, the end might have given"
3445,MDCCLXXXIV.,some sanction to the means; but usurpation and slavery followed. Milton
3446,MDCCLXXXIV.,"undertook the office of secretary, under the despotic power of Cromwell,"
3447,MDCCLXXXIV.,"offering the incense of adulation to his master, with the titles of"
3448,MDCCLXXXIV.,"""director of public councils, the leader of unconquered armies, the"
3449,MDCCLXXXIV.,"father of his country."" Milton declared, at the same time, ""that nothing"
3450,MDCCLXXXIV.,"is more pleasing to God, or more agreeable to reason, than that the"
3451,MDCCLXXXIV.,"highest mind should have the sovereign power."" In this strain of servile"
3452,MDCCLXXXIV.,"flattery, Milton gives us the right divine of tyrants. But it seems, in"
3453,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the same piece, he exhorts Cromwell ""not to desert those great"
3454,MDCCLXXXIV.,"principles of liberty which he had professed to espouse; for, it would"
3455,MDCCLXXXIV.,"be a grievous enormity, if, after having successfully opposed tyranny,"
3456,MDCCLXXXIV.,"he should himself act the part of a tyrant, and betray the cause that he"
3457,MDCCLXXXIV.,"had defended."" This desertion of every honest principle the advocate for"
3458,MDCCLXXXIV.,"liberty lived to see. Cromwell acted the tyrant; and, with vile"
3459,MDCCLXXXIV.,"hypocrisy, told the people, that he had consulted the Lord, and the Lord"
3460,MDCCLXXXIV.,would have it so. Milton took an under part in the tragedy. Did that
3461,MDCCLXXXIV.,become the defender of the people of England? Brutus saw his country
3462,MDCCLXXXIV.,"enslaved; he struck the blow for freedom, and he died with honour in the"
3463,MDCCLXXXIV.,"cause. Had he lived to be a secretary under Tiberius, what would now be"
3464,MDCCLXXXIV.,said of his memory?
3465,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3466,MDCCLXXXIV.,"But still, it seems, the prostitution with which Milton is charged,"
3467,MDCCLXXXIV.,"since it cannot be defended, is to be retorted on the character of"
3468,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Johnson. For this purpose, a book has been published, called Remarks on"
3469,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Dr. Johnson's Life of Milton; to which are added, Milton's Tractate of"
3470,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Education, and Areopagitica. In this laboured tract we are told, ""There"
3471,MDCCLXXXIV.,"is one performance, ascribed to the pen of the Doctor, where the"
3472,MDCCLXXXIV.,"prostitution is of so singular a nature, that it would be difficult to"
3473,MDCCLXXXIV.,"select an adequate motive for it, out of the mountainous heap of"
3474,MDCCLXXXIV.,"conjectural causes of human passions, or human caprice. It is the speech"
3475,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of the late unhappy Dr. William Dodd, when he was about to hear the"
3476,MDCCLXXXIV.,"sentence of the law pronounced upon him, in consequence of an indictment"
3477,MDCCLXXXIV.,for forgery. The voice of the public has given the honour of
3478,MDCCLXXXIV.,"manufacturing this speech to Dr. Johnson; and the style, and"
3479,MDCCLXXXIV.,"configuration of the speech itself, confirm the imputation. But it is"
3480,MDCCLXXXIV.,hardly possible to divine what could be his motive for accepting the
3481,MDCCLXXXIV.,"office. A man, to express the precise state of mind of another, about to"
3482,MDCCLXXXIV.,"be destined to an ignominious death, for a capital crime, should, one"
3483,MDCCLXXXIV.,"would imagine, have some consciousness, that he himself had incurred"
3484,MDCCLXXXIV.,"some guilt of the same kind."" In all the schools of sophistry, is there"
3485,MDCCLXXXIV.,"to be found so vile an argument? In the purlieus of Grub street, is"
3486,MDCCLXXXIV.,"there such another mouthful of dirt? In the whole quiver of malice, is"
3487,MDCCLXXXIV.,there so envenomed a shaft?
3488,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3489,MDCCLXXXIV.,"After this, it is to be hoped, that a certain class of men will talk no"
3490,MDCCLXXXIV.,"more of Johnson's malignity. The last apology for Milton is, that he"
3491,MDCCLXXXIV.,acted according to his principles. But Johnson thought those principles
3492,MDCCLXXXIV.,"detestable; pernicious to the constitution, in church and state,"
3493,MDCCLXXXIV.,"destructive of the peace of society, and hostile to the great fabric of"
3494,MDCCLXXXIV.,"civil policy, which the wisdom of ages has taught every Briton to"
3495,MDCCLXXXIV.,"revere, to love, and cherish. He reckoned Milton in that class of men,"
3496,MDCCLXXXIV.,"of whom the Roman historian says, when they want, by a sudden"
3497,MDCCLXXXIV.,"convulsion, to overturn the government, they roar and clamour for"
3498,MDCCLXXXIV.,"liberty; if they succeed, they destroy liberty itself: ""Ut imperium"
3499,MDCCLXXXIV.,"evertant, libertatem praeferunt; si perverterint, libertatem ipsam"
3500,MDCCLXXXIV.,"aggredientur."" Such were the sentiments of Dr. Johnson; and it may be"
3501,MDCCLXXXIV.,"asked, in the language of Bolingbroke, ""Are these sentiments, which any"
3502,MDCCLXXXIV.,"man, who is born a Briton, in any circumstances, in any situation, ought"
3503,MDCCLXXXIV.,"to be ashamed, or afraid to avow?"" Johnson has done ample justice to"
3504,MDCCLXXXIV.,Milton's poetry: the criticism on Paradise Lost is a sublime
3505,MDCCLXXXIV.,composition. Had he thought the author as good and pious a citizen as
3506,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Dr. Watts, he would have been ready, notwithstanding his nonconformity,"
3507,MDCCLXXXIV.,to do equal honour to the memory of the man.
3508,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3509,MDCCLXXXIV.,"It is now time to close this essay, which the author fears has been"
3510,MDCCLXXXIV.,"drawn too much into length. In the progress of the work, feeble as it"
3511,MDCCLXXXIV.,"may be, he thought himself performing the last human office to the"
3512,MDCCLXXXIV.,"memory of a friend, whom he loved, esteemed, and honoured:"
3513,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3514,MDCCLXXXIV.,"""His saltern accumulem donis, et fungar inani"
3515,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Munere.""--"
3516,MDCCLXXXIV.,
3517,MDCCLXXXIV.,The author of these memoirs has been anxious to give the features of the
3518,MDCCLXXXIV.,"man, and the true character of the author. He has not suffered the hand"
3519,MDCCLXXXIV.,of partiality to colour his excellencies with too much warmth; nor has
3520,MDCCLXXXIV.,he endeavoured to throw his singularities too much into the shade. Dr.
3521,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Johnson's failings may well be forgiven, for the sake of his virtues."
3522,MDCCLXXXIV.,"His defects were spots in the sun. His piety, his kind affections, and"
3523,MDCCLXXXIV.,"the goodness of his heart, present an example worthy of imitation. His"
3524,MDCCLXXXIV.,works still remain a monument of genius and of learning. Had he written
3525,MDCCLXXXIV.,"nothing but what is contained in this edition, the quantity shows a life"
3526,MDCCLXXXIV.,"spent in study and meditation. If to this be added, the labour of his"
3527,MDCCLXXXIV.,"Dictionary, and other various productions, it may be fairly allowed, as"
3528,MDCCLXXXIV.,"he used to say of himself, that he has written his share. In the volumes"
3529,MDCCLXXXIV.,here presented to the public the reader will find a perpetual source of
3530,MDCCLXXXIV.,"pleasure and instruction. With due precautions, authors may learn to"
3531,MDCCLXXXIV.,"grace their style with elegance, harmony, and precision; they may be"
3532,MDCCLXXXIV.,"taught to think with vigour and perspicuity; and, to crown the whole, by"
3533,MDCCLXXXIV.,"a diligent attention to these books, all may advance in virtue."

3655,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,have exercised inquiry. The following is the best account of them we can
3656,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,collect:
3657,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,
3658,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,THOMAS LYDIAT was born in 1572. After passing through the studies of the
3659,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"university of Oxford, with applause, he was elected fellow of New"
3660,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,college; but his defective utterance induced him to resign his
3661,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"fellowship, in order to avoid entering holy orders, and to live upon a"
3662,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,small patrimony. He was highly esteemed by the accomplished and
3663,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"unfortunate prince Henry, son of James the first. But his hopes of"
3664,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,provision in that quarter were blasted by that prince's premature death;
3665,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,and he then accompanied the celebrated Usher into Ireland. After two or
3666,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"three years, he returned to England, and poverty induced him now to"
3667,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"accept the rectory of Okerton, near Banbury, which he had before"
3668,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,declined. Here he imprudently became security for the debts of a
3669,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"relation, and, being unable to pay, was imprisoned for several years. He"
3670,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"was released, at last, by his patron, Usher, sir W. Boswell, Dr. Pink,"
3671,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"then warden of New college, and archbishop Laud, to whom he showed his"
3672,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,gratitude by writing in defence of his measures of church-government. He
3673,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,now applied to Charles the first for his protection and encouragement to
3674,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"travel into the east, to collect MSS. but the embarrassed state of the"
3675,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"king's affairs prevented his petition from receiving attention. Lastly,"
3676,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,his well-known attachment to the royal cause drew upon him the repeated
3677,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"violence of the parliament troops, who plundered, imprisoned, and abused"
3678,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"him, in the most cruel manner. He died in obscurity and indigence, in"
3679,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"1646. A stone was laid over his grave in Okerton church, in 1669, by the"
3680,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"society of New college, who also erected an honorary monument to his"
3681,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,memory in the cloisters of their college. We have dwelt thus long on
3682,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"Lydiat's name, because, when this poem was published, it was a subject"
3683,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"of inquiry, who Lydiat was, though some of his contemporaries, both in"
3684,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"England and on the continent, ranked him with lord Bacon, in"
3685,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"mathematical and physical knowledge. For a more detailed account, see"
3686,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"Chalmers' Biographical Dictionary, vol. xxi. whence the above facts have"
3687,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"been extracted, and Gentleman's Magazine, vol. lxviii. GALILEO, and his"
3688,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"history, are too well known to require a note in this place."

3691,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"the subject of Smollett's memoirs, in Peregrine Pickle, but, according"
3692,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"to Mr. Malone, she was Anne Vane, mistress to Frederick prince of Wales,"
3693,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"and died in 1736, not long before Johnson settled in London. Some"
3694,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"account of her was published, under the title of the Secret History of"
3695,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"Vanella, 8vo. 1732, and in other similar works, referred to in Boswell,"
3696,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"i. 173. In Mr. Boswell's Tour to the Hebrides, we find lord Hailes"
3697,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"objecting to the instances of unfortunate beauties selected by Johnson,"
3698,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"and suggesting, in place of Vane and Sedley, the names of Shore and"
3699,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,Valière.
3700,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,
3701,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"CATHERINE SEDLEY was daughter of sir Charles Sedley, mistress of king"
3702,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"James the second, who created her countess of Dorchester. She was a"
3703,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"woman of a sprightly and agreeable wit, which could charm without the"
3704,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"aid of beauty, and longer maintain its power. She had been the king's"
3705,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"mistress before he ascended the throne, and soon after (January 2,"
3706,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"1685-6) was created countess of Dorchester. Sir C. Sedley, her father,"
3707,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"looked on this title, as a splendid indignity, purchased at the expense of"
3708,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"his daughter's honour; and when he was very active against the king, about"
3709,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"the time of the revolution, he said, that, in gratitude, he should do"
3710,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"his utmost to make his majesty's daughter a queen, as the king had made"
3711,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"his own a countess. The king continued to visit her, which gave great"
3712,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"uneasiness to the queen, who employed her friends, particularly the"
3713,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"priests, to persuade him to break off the correspondence. They"
3714,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"remonstrated with him on the guilt of the commerce, and the reproach it"
3715,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"would bring on the catholic religion; she, on the contrary, employed the"
3716,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,whole force of her ridicule against the priests and their counsels.
3717,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"They, at length, prevailed, and he is said to have sent her word to"
3718,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"retire to France, or that her pension of 4,000_l_. a year should be"
3719,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"withdrawn. She then, probably, repented of having been the royal"
3720,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"mistress, and ""cursed the form that pleased the king."""

3724,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"It is remarkable, that when Johnson was asked, at a late period of his"
3725,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"life, to whom he had alluded, under the name of Sedley, he said, that he"
3726,AD RICARDUM SAVAGE.,"had quite forgotten. See note on Idler, No. 36.--ED."

4731,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,
4732,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"The history of this tragedy's composition is interesting, as affording"
4733,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"dates to distinguish Johnson's literary progress. It was begun, and"
4734,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"considerably advanced, while he kept a school at Edial, near Lichfield,"
4735,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"in 1736. In the following year, when he relinquished the task of a"
4736,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"schoolmaster, so little congenial with his mind and disposition, and"
4737,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"resolved to seek his fortunes in the metropolis, Irene was carried along"
4738,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"with him as a foundation for his success. Mr. Walmsley, one of his early"
4739,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"friends, recommended him, and his fellow-adventurer, Garrick, to the"
4740,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"notice and protection of Colson, the mathematician. Unless Mrs. Piozzi"
4741,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"is correct, in rescuing the character of Colson from any identity with"
4742,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"that of Gelidus, in the Rambler[a], Johnson entertained no lively"
4743,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,recollection of his first patron's kindness. He was ever warm in
4744,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"expressions of gratitude for favours, conferred on him in his season of"
4745,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"want and obscurity; and from his deep silence here, we may conclude,"
4746,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,that the recluse mathematician did not evince much sympathy with the
4747,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"distresses of the young candidate for dramatic fame. Be this, however,"
4748,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"as it may, Johnson, shortly after this introduction, took lodgings at"
4749,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"Greenwich, to proceed with his Irene in quiet and retirement, but soon"
4750,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"returned to Lichfield, to complete it. The same year that saw these"
4751,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"successive disappointments, witnessed also Johnson's return to London,"
4752,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"with his tragedy completed, and its rejection by Fleetwood, the"
4753,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"patentee, at that time, of Drury lane theatre. Twelve years elapsed,"
4754,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"before it was acted, and, after many alterations by his pupil and"
4755,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"companion, Garrick, who was then manager of the theatre, it was, by his"
4756,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"zeal, and the support of the most eminent performers of the day, carried"
4757,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"through a representation of nine nights. Johnson's profits, after the"
4758,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"deduction of expenses, and together with the hundred pounds, which he"
4759,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"received from Robert Dodsley, for the copy, were nearly three hundred"
4760,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"pounds. So fallacious were the hopes cherished by Walmsley, that Johnson"
4761,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"would ""turn out a fine tragedy writer[b]."""
4762,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,
4763,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"""The tragedy of Irene,"" says Mr. Murphy, ""is founded on a passage in"
4764,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"Knolles's History of the Turks;"" an author highly commended in the"
4765,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"Rambler, No. 122. An incident in the life of Mahomet the great, first"
4766,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"emperor of the Turks, is the hinge, on which the fable is made to move."
4767,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"The substance of the story is shortly this:--In 1453, Mahomet laid siege"
4768,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"to Constantinople, and, having reduced the place, became enamoured of a"
4769,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"fair Greek, whose name was Irene. The sultan invited her to embrace the"
4770,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"law of the prophet, and to grace his throne. Enraged at this intended"
4771,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"marriage, the janizaries formed a conspiracy to dethrone the emperor. To"
4772,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"avert the impending danger, Mahomet, in a full assembly of the grandees,"
4773,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"""catching, with one hand,"" as Knolles relates it, ""the fair Greek by the"
4774,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"hair of her head, and drawing his falchion with the other, he, at one"
4775,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"blow, struck off her head, to the great terror of them all; and, having"
4776,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"so done, said unto them, 'Now, by this, judge whether your emperor is"
4777,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"able to bridle his affections or not[c].'"" We are not unjust, we"
4778,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"conceive, in affirming, that there is an interest kept alive in the"
4779,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"plain and simple narrative of the old historian, which is lost in the"
4780,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,declamatory tragedy of Johnson.
4781,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,
4782,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"It is sufficient, for our present purpose, to confess that he _has_"
4783,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"failed in this his only dramatic attempt; we shall endeavour, more"
4784,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"fully, to show _how_ he has failed, in our discussion of his powers as a"
4785,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"critic. That they were not blinded to the defects of others, by his own"
4786,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"inefficiency in dramatic composition, is fully proved by his judicious"
4787,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"remarks on Cato, which was constructed on a plan similar to Irene: and"
4788,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"the strongest censure, ever passed on this tragedy, was conveyed in"
4789,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"Garrick's application of Johnson's own severe, but correct critique, on"
4790,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"the wits of Charles, in whose works"
4791,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,
4792,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"""Declamation roar'd, while passion slept.""[d]"
4793,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,
4794,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"""Addison speaks the language of poets,"" says Johnson, in his preface to"
4795,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"Shakespeare, ""and Shakespeare of men. We find in Cato innumerable"
4796,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"beauties, which enamour us of its author, but we see nothing that"
4797,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"acquaints us with human sentiments, or human actions; we place it with"
4798,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,the fairest and the noblest progeny which judgment propagates by
4799,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,conjunction with learning; but Othello is the vigorous and vivacious
4800,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"offspring of observation, impregnated by genius. Cato affords a splendid"
4801,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"exhibition of artificial and fictitious manners, and delivers just and"
4802,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"noble sentiments, in diction easy, elevated and harmonious; but its"
4803,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,hopes and fears communicate no vibration to the heart: the composition
4804,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"refers us only to the writer; we pronounce the name of Cato, but we"
4805,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"think on Addison."" The critic's remarks on the same tragedy, in his Life"
4806,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"of Addison, are as applicable as the above to his own production. ""Cato"
4807,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,is rather a poem in dialogue than a drama; rather a succession of just
4808,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"sentiments in elegant language, than a representation of natural"
4809,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"affections, or of any state probable or possible in human life. Nothing"
4810,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,here 'excites or assuages emotion:' here is no 'magical power of raising
4811,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,phantastick terrour or wild anxiety.' The events are expected without
4812,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"solicitude, and are remembered without joy or sorrow. Of the agents we"
4813,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"have no care; we consider not what they are doing, or what they are"
4814,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"suffering; we wish only to know what they have to say."""
4815,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,
4816,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"But, while we thus pronounce Johnson's failure in the production of"
4817,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"dramatic effect, we will not withhold our tribute of admiration from"
4818,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"Irene, as a moral piece. For, although a remark of Fox's on an"
4819,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"unpublished tragedy of Burke's, that it was rather rhetorical than"
4820,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"poetical, may be applied to the work under consideration; still it"
4821,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"abounds, throughout, with the most elevated and dignified lessons of"
4822,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"morality and virtue. The address of Demetrius to the aged Cali, on the"
4823,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,dangers of procrastination[e]; Aspasia's reprobation of Irene's
4824,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,meditated apostasy[f]; and the allusive panegyric on the British
4825,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"constitution[g], may be enumerated, as examples of its excellence in"
4826,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,sentiment and diction.
4827,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,
4828,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"Lastly, we may consider Irene, as one other illustrious proof, that the"
4829,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"most strict adherence to the far-famed unities, the most harmonious"
4830,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"versification, and the most correct philosophy, will not vie with a"
4831,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"single and simple touch of nature, expressed in simple and artless"
4832,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"language. ""But how rich in reputation must that author be, who can spare"
4833,THE TRAGEDY OF IRENE.,"_an Irene_, and not feel the loss [h]."""

11063,SEPTEM AETATES.,"are not quite so exactly done.--For the convenience of the reader,"
11064,SEPTEM AETATES.,"it has been thought right to subjoin each number, as it stands in"
11065,SEPTEM AETATES.,"Templeman's works, to that in Dr. Johnson's verses which refers to"
11066,SEPTEM AETATES.,it.
11067,SEPTEM AETATES.,"[b] In this first article that is versified, there is an accurate"
11068,SEPTEM AETATES.,conformity in Dr. Johnson's number to Templeman's; who sets down the
11069,SEPTEM AETATES.,"square miles of Palestine at 7,600."
11070,SEPTEM AETATES.,"[c] The square miles of Egypt are, in Templeman, 140,700."

11073,SEPTEM AETATES.,"[e] In the four following articles, the numbers in Templeman and in"
11074,SEPTEM AETATES.,"Johnson's verses are alike.--We find, accordingly, the Morea, in"
11075,SEPTEM AETATES.,"Templeman, to be set down at 7,220 square miles.--Arabia, at"
11076,SEPTEM AETATES.,"700,000.--Persia, at 800,000.--and Naples, at 22,000."
11077,SEPTEM AETATES.,"[f] Sicily, in Templeman, is put down at 9,400."
11078,SEPTEM AETATES.,"[g] The pope's dominions, at 14,868."
11079,SEPTEM AETATES.,"[h] Tuscany, at 6,640."
11080,SEPTEM AETATES.,"[i] Genoa, in Templeman, as in Johnson likewise, is set down at 2,400."
11081,SEPTEM AETATES.,"[j] Lucca, at 286."
11082,SEPTEM AETATES.,"[k] The Russian empire, in the 29th plate of Templeman, is set down at"
11083,SEPTEM AETATES.,"3,303,485 square miles."
11084,SEPTEM AETATES.,"[l] Sardinia, in Templeman, as likewise in Johnson, 6,600."
11085,SEPTEM AETATES.,"[m] The habitable world, in Templeman, is computed, in square miles, at"
11086,SEPTEM AETATES.,"30,666,806 square miles."
11087,SEPTEM AETATES.,"[n] Asia, at 10,257,487."

11094,SEPTEM AETATES.,"[t] In the three remaining instances, which make the whole that Dr."
11095,SEPTEM AETATES.,"Johnson appears to have rendered into Latin verse, we find the"
11096,SEPTEM AETATES.,"numbers exactly agreeing with those of Templeman, who makes the"
11097,SEPTEM AETATES.,"square miles of the United Provinces, 9540--of the province of"

11147,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,
11148,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,The following incomparable tale was published in 1759; and the
11149,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"early familiarity with eastern manners, which Johnson derived"
11150,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"from his translation of father Lobo's travels into Abissinia, may"
11151,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,be presumed to have led him to fix his opening scene in that
11152,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"country; while Rassela Christos, the general of sultan Sequed,"
11153,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"mentioned in that work, may have suggested the name of his"
11154,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,speculative prince. Rasselas was written in the evenings of a
11155,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"single week, and sent to the press, in portions, with the amiable"
11156,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,view of defraying the funeral expenses of the author's aged
11157,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"mother, and discharging her few remaining debts. The sum,"
11158,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"however, which he received for it, does not seem large, to those"
11159,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,who know its subsequent popularity. None of his works has
11160,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"been more widely circulated; and the admiration, which it has"
11161,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"attracted, in almost every country of Europe, proves, that, with"
11162,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"all its depression and sadness, it does utter a voice, that meets"
11163,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"with an assenting answer in the hearts of all who have tried life,"
11164,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,and found its emptiness. Johnson's view of our lot on earth was
11165,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"always gloomy, and the circumstances, under which Rasselas was"
11166,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"composed, were calculated to add a deepened tinge of melancholy"
11167,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"to its speculations on human folly, misery, or malignity. Many"
11168,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"of the subjects discussed, are known to have been those which"
11169,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"had agitated Johnson's mind. Among them is the question,"
11170,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,whether the departed ever revisit the places that knew them
11171,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"on earth, and how far they may take an interest in the welfare"
11172,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"of those, over whom they watched, when here. We shall elsewhere"
11173,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"have to contemplate the moralist, standing on the border"
11174,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"of his mother's grave, and asking, with anxious agony, whether"
11175,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"that dark bourn, once passed, terminated for ever the cares of"
11176,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"maternity and love[a]. The frivolous and the proud, who think"
11177,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"not, or acknowledge not, that there are secrets, in both matter"
11178,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"and mind, of which their philosophy has not dreamed, may smile"
11179,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"at what they may, in their derision, term such weak and idle"
11180,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"inquiries. But on them, the most powerful minds that ever"
11181,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"illuminated this world, have fastened, with an intense curiosity;"
11182,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"and, owning their fears, or their ignorance, have not dared to"
11183,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,disavow their belief[b].
11184,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,
11185,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"It is not to be denied, that Rasselas displays life, as one unvaried"
11186,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"series of disappointments, and leaves the mind, at its"
11187,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"close, in painful depression. This effect has been considered an"
11188,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"evil, and regarded even as similar to that produced by the doctrines"
11189,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"of Voltaire, Bolingbroke, and Rousseau, who combined"
11190,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"every thing venerable on earth with ridicule, treated virtue and"
11191,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"vice, with equal contemptuous indifference, and laid bare, with"
11192,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"cruel mockery, the vanity of all mortal wishes, prospects, and"
11193,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"pursuits. Their motive, for all this, we need not pause, in this"
11194,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"place, to examine. But a distinction may be made between the"
11195,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"melancholy of the heart, and the melancholy of the mind: while"
11196,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"the latter is sceptical, sour, and misanthropic, the former is"
11197,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"passionate, tender, and religious. Those who are under the influence"
11198,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"of the one, become inactive, morose, or heedless: detecting"
11199,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"the follies of the wisest and the frailties of the best, they scoff at"
11200,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"the very name of virtue; they spurn, as visionary and weak, every"
11201,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"attempt to meliorate man's condition, and from their conviction"
11202,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"of the earthward tendency of his mind, they bound his destinies"
11203,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,by this narrow world and its concerns. But those whose hearts
11204,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"are penetrated with a feeling for human infirmity and sorrow,"
11205,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"are benevolent and active; considering man, as the victim of sin,"
11206,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"and woe, and death, for a cause which reason cannot unfold, but"
11207,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"which religion promises to terminate, they sooth the short-lived"
11208,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"disappointments of life, by pointing to a loftier and more lasting"
11209,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"state. Candide is the book of the one party, Rasselas of the"
11210,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,other. They appeared nearly together; they exhibit the same
11211,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"picture of change, and misery, and crime. But the one demoralized"
11212,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"a continent, and gave birth to lust, and rapine, and"
11213,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"bloodshed; the other has blessed many a heart, and gladdened"
11214,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"the vale of sorrow, with many a rill of pure and living water."
11215,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"Voltaire may be likened to the venomous toad of eastern allegory,"
11216,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,which extracts a deadly poison from that sunbeam which
11217,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"bears health, and light, and life to all beside: the philosopher,"
11218,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"in Rasselas, like some holy and aged man, who has well nigh run"
11219,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"his course, in recounting the toils and perils of his pilgrimage,"
11220,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"may sadden the young heart, and crush the fond hopes of inexperience;"
11221,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"but, while he wounds, he presents the antidote and the"
11222,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"balm, and tells, where promises will be realized, and hopes will"
11223,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,no more be disappointed. We have ventured to detain our
11224,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"readers thus long from Rasselas itself, because, from its similar"
11225,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"view of life with the sceptical school, many well-intentioned men"
11226,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"have apprehended, its effects might be the same. We have,"
11227,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"therefore, attempted briefly to distinguish the sources whence"
11228,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"these different writings have issued, and, we trust, we have"
11229,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,pointed out their remoteness from each other. And we do not
11230,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"dwell on the subject, at greater length, because Johnson's writings,"
11231,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"in various parts, will require our attention on this particular head."
11232,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,To be restless and weary of the dull details and incomplete enjoyments
11233,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"of life, is common to all lofty minds. Frederick of"
11234,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"Prussia sought, in the bosom of a cold philosophy, to chill every"
11235,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"generous impulse, and each warm aspiration after immortality;"
11236,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"but he painfully felt, how inefficient was grandeur, or power, to"
11237,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"fill the heart, and plaintively exclaimed to Maupertuis, ""Que"
11238,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"notre vie est peu de chose;"" all is vanity. The philosophy of"
11239,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"Rasselas, however, though it pronounces on the unsatisfactory"
11240,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"nature of all human enjoyments, and though its perusal may"
11241,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"check the worldling in his mirth, and bring down the mighty"
11242,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"in his pride, does not, with the philosophic conqueror, sullenly"
11243,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"despair, but gently sooths the mourner, by the prospect of a final"
11244,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"recompense and repose. Its pages inculcate the same lesson, as"
11245,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"those of the Rambler, but ""the precept, which is tedious in a"
11246,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"formal essay, may acquire attractions in a tale, and the sober"
11247,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,charms of truth be divested of their austerity by the graces of
11248,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"innocent fiction[c]."" We may observe, in conclusion, that the"
11249,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"abrupt termination of Rasselas, so left, according to sir John"
11250,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"Hawkins, by its author, to admit of continuation, and its unbroken"
11251,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"gloom, induced Miss E. Cornelia Knight to present to"
11252,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,"the public a tale, entitled Dinarbas, to exhibit the fairer view of"
11253,PREFATORY OBSERVATIONS.,life.

11285,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"According to the custom, which has descended, from age to age, among the"

11289,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,
11290,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"The place, which the wisdom, or policy, of antiquity had destined for"
11291,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"the residence of the Abissinan princes, was a spacious valley in the"
11292,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"kingdom of Amhara, surrounded, on every side, by mountains, of which the"
11293,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"summits overhang the middle part. The only passage, by which it could be"
11294,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"entered, was a cavern that passed under a rock, of which it has been"
11295,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"long disputed, whether it was the work of nature, or of human industry."
11296,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"The outlet of the cavern was concealed by a thick wood, and the mouth,"
11297,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"which opened into the valley, was closed with gates of iron, forged by"
11298,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"the artificers of ancient days, so massy, that no man could, without the"
11299,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"help of engines, open or shut them."
11300,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,
11301,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"From the mountains, on every side, rivulets descended, that filled all"
11302,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"the valley with verdure and fertility, and formed a lake in the middle,"
11303,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"inhabited by fish of every species, and frequented by every fowl, whom"
11304,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,nature has taught to dip the wing in water. This lake discharged its
11305,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"superfluities by a stream, which entered a dark cleft of the mountain,"
11306,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"on the northern side, and fell, with dreadful noise, from precipice to"
11307,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"precipice, till it was heard no more."
11308,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,
11309,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,The sides of the mountains were covered with trees; the banks of the
11310,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,brooks were diversified with flowers; every blast shook spices from the
11311,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,rocks; and every month dropped fruits upon the ground. All animals that
11312,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"bite the grass, or browse the shrub, whether wild or tame, wandered in"
11313,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"this extensive circuit, secured from beasts of prey, by the mountains"
11314,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"which confined them. On one part, were flocks and herds feeding in the"
11315,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"pastures; on another, all the beasts of chase frisking in the lawns; the"
11316,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"sprightly kid was bounding on the rocks, the subtle monkey frolicking in"
11317,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"the trees, and the solemn elephant reposing in the shade. All the"
11318,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"diversities of the world were brought together, the blessings of nature"
11319,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"were collected, and its evils extracted and excluded."
11320,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,
11321,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"The valley, wide and fruitful, supplied its inhabitants with the"
11322,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"necessaries of life; and all delights and superfluities were added, at"
11323,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"the annual visit which the emperour paid his children, when the iron"
11324,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"gate was opened to the sound of musick; and during eight days every one,"
11325,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"that resided in the valley, was required to propose whatever might"
11326,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"contribute to make seclusion pleasant, to fill up the vacancies of"
11327,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"attention, and lessen the tediousness of time. Every desire was"
11328,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,immediately granted. All the artificers of pleasure were called to
11329,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"gladden the festivity; the musicians exerted the power of harmony, and"
11330,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"the dancers showed their activity before the princes, in hope that they"
11331,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"should pass their lives in this blissful captivity, to which those only"
11332,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"were admitted, whose performance was thought able to add novelty to"
11333,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"luxury. Such was the appearance of security and delight, which this"
11334,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"retirement afforded, that they, to whom it was new, always desired, that"
11335,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"it might be perpetual; and, as those, on whom the iron gate had once"
11336,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"closed, were never suffered to return, the effect of long experience"
11337,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"could not be known. Thus every year produced new schemes of delight, and"
11338,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,new competitors for imprisonment.
11339,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,
11340,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"The palace stood on an eminence, raised about thirty paces above the"
11341,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"surface of the lake. It was divided into many squares or courts, built"
11342,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"with greater or less magnificence, according to the rank of those for"
11343,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,whom they were designed. The roofs were turned into arches of massy
11344,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"stone, joined by a cement that grew harder by time, and the building"
11345,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"stood, from century to century, deriding the solstitial rains and"
11346,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"equinoctial hurricanes, without need of reparation."

11351,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"there was an open and secret passage, every square had a communication"
11352,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"with the rest, either from the upper stories, by private galleries, or,"
11353,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"by subterranean passages, from the lower apartments. Many of the columns"
11354,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"had unsuspected cavities, in which a long race of monarchs had reposited"
11355,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"their treasures. They then closed up the opening with marble, which was"

11357,DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.,"recorded their accumulations in a book, which was itself concealed in a"

11369,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"to delight, and gratified with whatever the senses can enjoy. They"
11370,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"wandered in gardens of fragrance, and slept in the fortresses of"
11371,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"security. Every art was practised, to make them pleased with their own"
11372,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"condition. The sages, who instructed them, told them of nothing but the"
11373,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"miseries of publick life, and described all beyond the mountains, as"
11374,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"regions of calamity, where discord was always raging, and where man"

11376,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,
11377,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"To heighten their opinion of their own felicity, they were daily"
11378,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"entertained with songs, the subject of which was the happy valley. Their"
11379,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"appetites were excited, by frequent enumerations of different"
11380,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"enjoyments, and revelry and merriment was the business of every hour,"
11381,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"from the dawn of morning, to the close of even."
11382,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,
11383,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"These methods were, generally, successful; few of the princes had ever"
11384,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"wished to enlarge their bounds, but passed their lives in full"
11385,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"conviction, that they had all within their reach that art or nature"
11386,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"could bestow, and pitied those, whom fate had excluded from this seat of"

11388,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,
11389,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"Thus, they rose in the morning, and lay down at night, pleased with each"

11391,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"year of his age, began to withdraw himself from their pastimes and"
11392,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"assemblies, and to delight in solitary walks, and silent meditation. He"
11393,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"often sat before tables, covered with luxury, and forgot to taste the"
11394,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,dainties that were placed before him: he rose abruptly in the midst of
11395,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"the song, and hastily retired beyond the sound of musick. His attendants"
11396,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"observed the change, and endeavoured to renew his love of pleasure: he"
11397,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"neglected their officiousness, repulsed their invitations, and spent day"
11398,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"after day, on the banks of rivulets, sheltered with trees; where he"
11399,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"sometimes listened to the birds in the branches, sometimes observed the"
11400,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"fish playing in the stream, and anon cast his eyes upon the pastures and"
11401,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"mountains filled with animals, of which some were biting the herbage,"
11402,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,and some sleeping among the bushes.
11403,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,
11404,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"This singularity of his humour made him much observed. One of the sages,"
11405,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"in whose conversation he had formerly delighted, followed him secretly,"
11406,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"in hope of discovering the cause of his disquiet. Rasselas, who knew not"
11407,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"that any one was near him, having, for some time, fixed his eyes upon"
11408,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"the goats that were browsing among the rocks, began to compare their"
11409,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"condition with his own. ""What,"" said he, ""makes the difference between"
11410,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"man and all the rest of the animal creation? Every beast, that strays"
11411,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"beside me, has the same corporal necessities with myself: he is hungry,"
11412,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"and crops the grass, he is thirsty and drinks the stream, his thirst and"
11413,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"hunger are appeased, he is satisfied and sleeps: he rises again and is"
11414,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"hungry, he is again fed, and is at rest. I am hungry and thirsty, like"
11415,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"him, but when thirst and hunger cease, I am not at rest; I am, like him,"
11416,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"pained with want, but am not, like him, satisfied with fulness. The"
11417,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"intermediate hours are tedious and gloomy; I long again to be hungry,"
11418,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"that I may again quicken my attention. The birds peck the berries, or"
11419,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"the corn, and fly away to the groves, where they sit, in seeming"
11420,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"happiness, on the branches, and waste their lives in tuning one unvaried"
11421,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"series of sounds. I, likewise, can call the lutanist and the singer, but"
11422,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"the sounds, that pleased me yesterday, weary me to-day, and will grow"
11423,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,yet more wearisome to-morrow. I can discover within me no power of
11424,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"perception, which is not glutted with its proper pleasure, yet I do not"
11425,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"feel myself delighted. Man surely has some latent sense, for which this"
11426,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"place affords no gratification; or he has some desires, distinct from"
11427,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"sense, which must be satisfied, before he can be happy."""
11428,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,
11429,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"After this, he lifted up his head, and seeing the moon rising, walked"
11430,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"towards the palace. As he passed through the fields, and saw the animals"
11431,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"around him, ""Ye,"" said he, ""are happy, and need not envy me, that walk"
11432,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"thus among you, burdened with myself; nor do I, ye gentle beings, envy"
11433,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,your felicity; for it is not the felicity of man. I have many
11434,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"distresses, from which ye are free; I fear pain, when I do not feel it;"
11435,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"I sometimes shrink at evils recollected, and sometimes start at evils"
11436,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,anticipated: surely the equity of providence has balanced peculiar

11439,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"With observations like these, the prince amused himself, as he returned,"

11441,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"him to feel some complacence in his own perspicacity, and to receive"
11442,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"some solace of the miseries of life, from consciousness of the delicacy"
11443,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"with which he felt, and the eloquence with which he bewailed them. He"
11444,THE DISCONTENT OP RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.,"mingled, cheerfully, in the diversions of the evening, and all rejoiced"

11453,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"On the next day, his old instructor, imagining that he had now made"
11454,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"himself acquainted with his disease of mind, was in hope of curing it by"
11455,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"counsel, and officiously sought an opportunity of conference, which the"
11456,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"prince, having long considered him, as one whose intellects were"
11457,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"exhausted, was not very willing to afford: ""Why,"" said he, ""does this"
11458,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,man thus obtrude upon me? shall I be never suffered to forget those
11459,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"lectures, which pleased, only while they were new, and to become new"
11460,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"again, must be forgotten?"" He then walked into the wood, and composed"
11461,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"himself to his usual meditations, when, before his thoughts had taken"
11462,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"any settled form, he perceived his pursuer at his side, and was, at"
11463,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"first, prompted, by his impatience, to go hastily away; but, being"
11464,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"unwilling to offend a man, whom he had once reverenced, and still loved,"
11465,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,he invited him to sit down with him on the bank.
11466,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,
11467,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"The old man, thus encouraged, began to lament the change, which had been"
11468,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"lately observed in the prince, and to inquire, why he so often retired"
11469,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"from the pleasures of the palace, to loneliness and silence. ""I fly from"
11470,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"pleasure,"" said the prince, ""because pleasure has ceased to please; I am"
11471,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"lonely, because I am miserable, and am unwilling to cloud, with my"
11472,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"presence, the happiness of others."""
11473,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,
11474,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"""You, sir,"" said the sage, ""are the first who has complained of misery"
11475,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"in the happy valley. I hope to convince you, that your complaints have"
11476,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,no real cause. You are here in full possession of all that the emperour
11477,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"of Abissinia can bestow; here is neither labour to be endured, nor"
11478,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"danger to be dreaded, yet here is all that labour or danger can procure"
11479,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"or purchase. Look round, and tell me which of your wants is without"
11480,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"supply: if you want nothing, how are you unhappy?"""
11481,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,
11482,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"""That I want nothing,"" said the prince, ""or that I know not what I want,"
11483,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"is the cause of my complaint; if I had any known want, I should have a"
11484,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"certain wish; that wish would excite endeavour, and I should not then"
11485,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"repine to see the sun move so slowly towards the western mountain, or"
11486,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"lament when the day breaks, and sleep will no longer hide me from"
11487,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"myself. When I see the kids and the lambs chasing one another, I fancy,"
11488,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"that. I should be happy, if I had something to pursue. But, possessing"
11489,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"all that I can want, I find one day and one hour exactly like another,"
11490,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,except that the latter is still more tedious than the former. Let your
11491,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"experience inform me, how the day may now seem as short as in my"
11492,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"childhood, while nature was yet fresh, and every moment showed me what I"

11494,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"something to desire."""
11495,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,
11496,THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.,"The old man was surprised at this new species of affliction, and knew"

11509,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"At this time the sound of musick proclaimed the hour of repast, and the"
11510,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"conversation was concluded. The old man went away, sufficiently"
11511,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"discontented, to find that his reasonings had produced the only"
11512,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"conclusion which they were intended to prevent. But, in the decline of"
11513,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"life, shame and grief are of short duration; whether it be, that we bear"
11514,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"easily what we have borne long, or that, finding ourselves in age less"
11515,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"regarded, we less regard others; or that we look with slight regard upon"

11517,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,end.
11518,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,
11519,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"The prince, whose views were extended to a wider space, could not"
11520,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,speedily quiet his emotions. He had been before terrified at the length
11521,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"of life which nature promised him, because he considered, that in a long"
11522,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"time much must be endured; he now rejoiced in his youth, because in many"
11523,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,years much might be done.
11524,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,
11525,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"This first beam of hope, that had been ever darted into his mind,"
11526,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"rekindled youth in his cheeks, and doubled the lustre of his eyes. He"
11527,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"was fired with the desire of doing something, though he knew not yet,"
11528,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"with distinctness, either end or means."
11529,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,
11530,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"He was now no longer gloomy and unsocial; but, considering himself as"
11531,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"master of a secret stock of happiness, which he could enjoy only by"
11532,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"concealing it, he affected to be busy in all schemes of diversion, and"
11533,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"endeavoured to make others pleased with the state, of which he himself"
11534,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"was weary. But pleasures never can be so multiplied or continued, as not"
11535,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"to leave much of life unemployed; there were many hours, both of the"
11536,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"night and day, which he could spend, without suspicion, in solitary"
11537,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,thought. The load of life was much lightened: he went eagerly into the
11538,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"assemblies, because he supposed the frequency of his presence necessary"
11539,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"to the success of his purposes; he retired gladly to privacy, because he"
11540,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,had now a subject of thought.
11541,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,
11542,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,His chief amusement was to picture to himself that world which he had
11543,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,never seen; to place himself in various conditions; to be entangled in
11544,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"imaginary difficulties, and to be engaged in wild adventures: but his"
11545,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"benevolence always terminated his projects in the relief of distress,"
11546,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"the detection of fraud, the defeat of oppression, and the diffusion of"
11547,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,happiness.
11548,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,
11549,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,Thus passed twenty months of the life of Rasselas. He busied himself so
11550,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"intensely in visionary bustle, that he forgot his real solitude, and,"
11551,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"amidst hourly preparations for the various incidents of human affairs,"
11552,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"neglected to consider, by what means he should mingle with mankind."
11553,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,
11554,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"One day, as he was sitting on a bank, he feigned to himself an orphan"
11555,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"virgin, robbed of her little portion by a treacherous lover, and crying"
11556,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"after him, for restitution and redress. So strongly was the image"
11557,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"impressed upon his mind, that he started up in the maid's defence, and"
11558,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"ran forward to seize the plunderer, with all the eagerness of real"
11559,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,pursuit. Fear naturally quickens the flight of guilt: Rasselas could not
11560,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"catch the fugitive with his utmost efforts; but, resolving to weary, by"
11561,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"perseverance, him whom he could not surpass in speed, he pressed on till"
11562,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,the foot of the mountain stopped his course.
11563,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,
11564,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"Here he recollected himself, and smiled at his own useless impetuosity."
11565,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"Then, raising his eyes to the mountain, ""This,"" said he, ""is the fatal"
11566,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"obstacle that hinders, at once, the enjoyment of pleasure, and the"
11567,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,exercise of virtue. How long is it that my hopes and wishes have flown
11568,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"beyond this boundary of my life, which, yet, I never have attempted to"
11569,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"surmount!"""
11570,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,
11571,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"Struck with this reflection, he sat down to muse; and remembered, that,"
11572,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"since he first resolved to escape from his confinement, the sun had"
11573,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,passed twice over him in his annual course. He now felt a degree of
11574,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"regret, with which he had never been before acquainted. He considered,"
11575,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"how much might have been done in the time which had passed, and left"
11576,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,nothing real behind it. He compared twenty months with the life of man.
11577,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"""In life,"" said he, ""is not to be counted the ignorance of infancy, or"
11578,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"imbecility of age. We are long, before we are able to think, and we soon"
11579,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,cease from the power of acting. The true period of human existence may
11580,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"be reasonably estimated at forty years, of which I have mused away the"
11581,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"four and twentieth part. What I have lost was certain, for I have"
11582,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"certainly possessed it; but of twenty months to come, who can assure"
11583,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"me?"""
11584,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,
11585,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"The consciousness of his own folly pierced him deeply, and he was long"
11586,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"before he could be reconciled to himself. ""The rest of my time,"" said"
11587,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"he, ""has been lost, by the crime or folly of my ancestors, and the"
11588,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"absurd institutions of my country; I remember it with disgust, yet"
11589,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"without remorse: but the months that have passed, since new light darted"
11590,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"into my soul, since I formed a scheme of reasonable felicity, have been"
11591,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,squandered by my own fault. I have lost that which can never be
11592,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"restored: I have seen the sun rise and set for twenty months, an idle"
11593,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"gazer on the light of heaven: in this time, the birds have left the nest"
11594,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"of their mother, and committed themselves to the woods and to the skies:"
11595,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"the kid has forsaken the teat, and learned, by degrees, to climb the"
11596,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"rocks, in quest of independent sustenance. I only have made no advances,"

11598,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"changes, admonished me of the flux of life; the stream, that rolled"
11599,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"before my feet, upbraided my inactivity. I sat feasting on intellectual"
11600,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"luxury, regardless alike of the examples of the earth, and the"
11601,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,instructions of the planets. Twenty months are passed; who shall restore
11602,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"them?"""
11603,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,
11604,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,These sorrowful meditations fastened upon his mind; he passed four
11605,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"months, in resolving to lose no more time in idle resolves, and was"
11606,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"awakened to more vigorous exertion, by hearing a maid, who had broken a"
11607,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"porcelain cup, remark, that what cannot be repaired is not to be"
11608,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,regretted.
11609,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,
11610,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"This was obvious; and Rasselas reproached himself, that he had not"
11611,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"discovered it, having not known, or not considered, how many useful"
11612,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"hints are obtained by chance, and how often the mind, hurried by her own"
11613,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"ardour to distant views, neglects the truths that lie open before her."
11614,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,"He, for a few hours, regretted his regret, and from that time bent his"
11615,THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.,whole mind upon the means of escaping from the valley of happiness.

11622,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,
11623,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"He now found, that it would be very difficult to effect that which it"
11624,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"was very easy to suppose effected. When he looked round about him, he"
11625,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"saw himself confined by the bars of nature, which had never yet been"
11626,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"broken, and by the gate, through which none, that once had passed it,"
11627,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,were ever able to return. He was now impatient as an eagle in a grate.
11628,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"He passed week after week in clambering the mountains, to see if there"
11629,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"was any aperture which the bushes might conceal, but found all the"
11630,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,summits inaccessible by their prominence. The iron gate he despaired to
11631,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"open; for it was not only secured with all the power of art, but was"
11632,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"always watched by successive sentinels, and was, by its position,"
11633,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,exposed to the perpetual observation of all the inhabitants.
11634,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,
11635,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,He then examined the cavern through which the waters of the lake were
11636,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"discharged; and, looking down, at a time when the sun shone strongly"
11637,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"upon its mouth, he discovered it to be full of broken rocks, which,"
11638,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"though they permitted the stream to flow through many narrow passages,"
11639,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,would stop any body of solid bulk. He returned discouraged and dejected;
11640,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"but, having now known the blessing of hope, resolved never to despair."
11641,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,
11642,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"In these fruitless searches he spent ten months. The time, however,"
11643,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"passed cheerfully away: in the morning he rose with new hope, in the"
11644,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"evening applauded his own diligence, and in the night slept sound after"
11645,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"his fatigue. He met a thousand amusements, which beguiled his labour,"
11646,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,and diversified his thoughts. He discerned the various instincts of
11647,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"animals, and properties of plants, and found the place replete with"
11648,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"wonders, of which he purposed to solace himself with the contemplation,"
11649,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,if he should never be able to accomplish his flight; rejoicing that his
11650,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"endeavours, though yet unsuccessful, had supplied him with a source of"
11651,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,inexhaustible inquiry.
11652,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,
11653,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,But his original curiosity was not yet abated; he resolved to obtain
11654,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"some knowledge of the ways of men. His wish still continued, but his"
11655,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"hope grew less. He ceased to survey any longer the walls of his prison,"
11656,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"and spared to search, by new toils, for interstices which he knew could"
11657,THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.,"not be found; yet determined to keep his design always in view, and lay"

11666,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"Among the artists that had been allured into the happy valley, to labour"
11667,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"for the accommodation and pleasure of its inhabitants, was a man eminent"
11668,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"for his knowledge of the mechanick powers, who had contrived many"
11669,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"engines, both of use and recreation. By a wheel, which the stream"
11670,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"turned, he forced the water into a tower, whence it was distributed to"
11671,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"all the apartments of the palace. He erected a pavilion in the garden,"
11672,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,around which he kept the air always cool by artificial showers. One of
11673,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"the groves, appropriated to the ladies, was ventilated by fans, to which"
11674,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"the rivulet, that ran through it, gave a constant motion; and"
11675,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"instruments of soft musick were placed at proper distances, of which"
11676,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"some played by the impulse of the wind, and some by the power of the"
11677,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,stream.
11678,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,
11679,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"This artist was, sometimes, visited by Rasselas, who was pleased with"
11680,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"every kind of knowledge, imagining that the time would come, when all"
11681,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,his acquisitions should be of use to him in the open world. He came one
11682,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"day to amuse himself in his usual manner, and found the master busy in"
11683,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,building a sailing chariot: he saw that the design was practicable upon
11684,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"a level surface, and, with expressions of great esteem, solicited its"
11685,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,completion. The workman was pleased to find himself so much regarded by
11686,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"the prince, and resolved to gain yet higher honours. ""Sir,"" said he,"
11687,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"""you have seen but a small part of what the mechanick sciences can"
11688,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"perform. I have been long of opinion, that instead of the tardy"
11689,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"conveyance of ships and chariots, man might use the swifter migration of"
11690,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"wings; that the fields of air are open to knowledge, and that only"
11691,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"ignorance and idleness need crawl upon the ground."""
11692,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,
11693,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,This hint rekindled the prince's desire of passing the mountains: having
11694,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"seen what the mechanist had already performed, he was willing to fancy"
11695,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"that he could do more; yet resolved to inquire further, before he"
11696,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"suffered hope to afflict him by disappointment. ""I am afraid,"" said he"
11697,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"to the artist, ""that your imagination prevails over your skill, and that"
11698,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"you now tell me rather what you wish, than what you know. Every animal"
11699,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"has his element assigned him: the birds have the air, and man and beasts"
11700,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"the earth.""--""So,"" replied the mechanist, ""fishes have the water, in"
11701,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"which, yet, beasts can swim by nature, and men by art. He that can swim"
11702,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"needs not despair to fly: to swim is to fly in a grosser fluid, and to"
11703,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,fly is to swim in a subtler. We are only to proportion our power of
11704,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,resistance to the different density of matter through which we are to
11705,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"pass. You will be, necessarily, upborne by the air, if you can renew any"
11706,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"impulse upon it, faster than the air can recede from the pressure."""
11707,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,
11708,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"""But the exercise of swimming,"" said the prince, ""is very laborious; the"
11709,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"strongest limbs are soon wearied; I am afraid, the act of flying will be"
11710,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"yet more violent, and wings will be of no great use, unless we can fly"
11711,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"further than we can swim."""
11712,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,
11713,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"""The labour of rising from the ground,"" said the artist, ""will be great,"
11714,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"as we see it in the heavier domestick fowls; but as we mount higher, the"
11715,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"earth's attraction, and the body's gravity, will be gradually"
11716,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"diminished, till we shall arrive at a region, where the man will float"
11717,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,in the air without any tendency to fall; no care will then be necessary
11718,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"but to move forwards, which the gentlest impulse will effect. You, sir,"
11719,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"whose curiosity is so extensive, will easily conceive with what pleasure"
11720,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"a philosopher, furnished with wings, and hovering in the sky, would see"
11721,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"the earth, and all its inhabitants, rolling beneath him, and presenting"
11722,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"to him, successively, by its diurnal motion, all the countries within"
11723,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,the same parallel. How must it amuse the pendent spectator to see the
11724,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"moving scene of land and ocean, cities and deserts! To survey, with"
11725,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"equal security, the marts of trade, and the fields of battle; mountains"
11726,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"infested by barbarians, and fruitful regions gladdened by plenty, and"
11727,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,lulled by peace! How easily shall we then trace the Nile through all its
11728,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"passage; pass over to distant regions, and examine the face of nature,"
11729,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"from one extremity of the earth to the other!"""
11730,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,
11731,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"""All this,"" said the prince, ""is much to be desired; but I am afraid,"
11732,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,that no man will be able to breathe in these regions of speculation and
11733,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"tranquillity. I have been told, that respiration is difficult upon lofty"
11734,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"mountains, yet, from these precipices, though so high as to produce"
11735,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"great tenuity of air, it is very easy to fall; therefore, I suspect,"
11736,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"that from any height, where life can be supported, there may be danger"
11737,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"of too quick descent."""
11738,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,
11739,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"""Nothing,"" replied the artist, ""will ever be attempted, if all possible"
11740,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"objections must be first overcome. If you will favour my project, I will"
11741,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,try the first flight at my own hazard. I have considered the structure
11742,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"of all volant animals, and find the folding continuity of the bat's"
11743,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"wings most easily accommodated to the human form. Upon this model, I"
11744,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"shall begin my task tomorrow, and in a year, expect to tower into the"
11745,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,air beyond the malice and pursuit of man. But I will work only on this
11746,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"condition, that the art shall not be divulged, and that you shall not"
11747,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"require me to make wings for any but ourselves."""
11748,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,
11749,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"""Why,"" said Rasselas, ""should you envy others so great an advantage? All"
11750,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,skill ought to be exerted for universal good; every man has owed much to
11751,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"others, and ought to repay the kindness that he has received."""
11752,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,
11753,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"""If men were all virtuous,"" returned the artist, ""I should, with great"
11754,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"alacrity, teach them all to fly. But what would be the security of the"
11755,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"good, if the bad could, at pleasure, invade them from the sky? Against"
11756,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"an army sailing through the clouds, neither walls, nor mountains, nor"
11757,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"seas, could afford any security. A flight of northern savages might"
11758,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"hover in the wind, and light, at once, with irresistible violence, upon"
11759,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"the capital of a fruitful region, that was rolling under them. Even this"
11760,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"valley, the retreat of princes, the abode of happiness, might be"
11761,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"violated by the sudden descent of some of the naked nations, that swarm"
11762,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"on the coast of the southern sea."""
11763,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,
11764,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"The prince promised secrecy, and waited for the performance, not wholly"
11765,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"hopeless of success. He visited the work, from time to time, observed"
11766,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"its progress, and remarked many ingenious contrivances, to facilitate"
11767,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"motion, and unite levity with strength. The artist was every day more"
11768,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"certain, that he should leave vultures and eagles behind him, and the"
11769,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,contagion of his confidence seized upon the prince.

11771,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"In a year the wings were finished, and, on a morning appointed, the"

11773,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"his pinions awhile, to gather air, then leaped from his stand, and, in"
11774,A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.,"an instant, dropped into the lake. His wings, which were of no use in"

11789,THE PRINCE FINDS A MAN OF LEARNING.,His imagination was now at a stand; he had no prospect of entering into

11795,THE PRINCE FINDS A MAN OF LEARNING.,"The rain continued longer, and with more violence, than had been ever"

11797,THE PRINCE FINDS A MAN OF LEARNING.,"streamed into the plain on every side, till the cavern was too narrow to"
11798,THE PRINCE FINDS A MAN OF LEARNING.,"discharge the water. The lake overflowed its banks, and all the level of"

11804,THE PRINCE FINDS A MAN OF LEARNING.,"This inundation confined all the princes to domestick amusements, and"
11805,THE PRINCE FINDS A MAN OF LEARNING.,"the attention of Rasselas was particularly seized by a poem, which Imlac"

11807,THE PRINCE FINDS A MAN OF LEARNING.,"poet to attend him in his apartment, and recite his verses a second"

11809,THE PRINCE FINDS A MAN OF LEARNING.,"having found a man who knew the world so well, and could so skilfully"

11811,THE PRINCE FINDS A MAN OF LEARNING.,"which, though common to all other mortals, his confinement, from"
11812,THE PRINCE FINDS A MAN OF LEARNING.,"childhood, had kept him a stranger. The poet pitied his ignorance, and"

11817,THE PRINCE FINDS A MAN OF LEARNING.,"As they were sitting together, the prince commanded Imlac to relate his"

12371,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"The prince now dismissed his favourite to rest, but the narrative of"
12372,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,wonders and novelties filled his mind with perturbation. He revolved all
12373,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"that he had heard, and prepared innumerable questions for the morning."
12374,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,
12375,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,Much of his uneasiness was now removed. He had a friend to whom he could
12376,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"impart his thoughts, and whose experience could assist him in his"
12377,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,designs. His heart was no longer condemned to swell with silent
12378,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"vexation. He thought that even the happy valley might be endured, with"
12379,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"such a companion, and that, if they could range the world together, he"
12380,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,should have nothing further to desire.
12381,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,
12382,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"In a few days the water was discharged, and the ground dried. The prince"
12383,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"and Imlac then walked out together, to converse, without the notice of"
12384,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"the rest. The prince, whose thoughts were always on the wing, as he"
12385,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"passed by the gate, said, with a countenance of sorrow, ""Why art thou so"
12386,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"strong, and why is man so weak?"""
12387,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,
12388,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"""Man is not weak,"" answered his companion; ""knowledge is more than"
12389,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,equivalent to force. The master of mechanicks laughs at strength. I can
12390,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"burst the gate, but cannot do it secretly. Some other expedient must be"
12391,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"tried."""
12392,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,
12393,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"As they were walking on the side of the mountain, they observed that the"
12394,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"conies, which the rain had driven from their burrows, had taken shelter"
12395,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"among the bushes, and formed holes behind them, tending upwards, in an"
12396,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"oblique line. ""It has been the opinion of antiquity,"" said Imlac, ""that"
12397,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"human reason borrowed many arts from the instinct of animals; let us,"
12398,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"therefore, not think ourselves degraded by learning from the cony. We"
12399,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"may escape, by piercing the mountain in the same direction. We will"
12400,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"begin, where the summit hangs over the middle part, and labour upwards,"
12401,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"till we shall issue up beyond the prominence."""
12402,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,
12403,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"The eyes of the prince, when he heard this proposal, sparkled with joy."
12404,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"The execution was easy, and the success certain."
12405,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,
12406,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"No time was now lost. They hastened, early in the morning, to choose a"
12407,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"place proper for their mine. They clambered, with great fatigue, among"
12408,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"crags and brambles, and returned without having discovered any part that"
12409,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,favoured their design. The second and the third day were spent in the
12410,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"same manner, and with the same frustration. But, on the fourth, they"
12411,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"found a small cavern, concealed by a thicket, where they resolved to"
12412,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,make their experiment.
12413,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,
12414,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"Imlac procured instruments proper to hew stone and remove earth, and"
12415,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,they fell to their work on the next day with more eagerness than vigour.
12416,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"They were presently exhausted by their efforts, and sat down to pant"
12417,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"upon the grass. The prince, for a moment, appeared to be discouraged."
12418,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"""Sir,"" said his companion, ""practice will enable us to continue our"
12419,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"labour for a longer time; mark, however, how far we have advanced, and"
12420,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"you will find, that our toil will sometime have an end. Great works are"
12421,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"performed, not by strength, but perseverance: yonder palace was raised"
12422,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"by single stones, yet you see its height and spaciousness. He that shall"
12423,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"walk with vigour three hours a day, will pass, in seven years, a space"

12425,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,
12426,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"They returned to their work day after day, and, in a short time, found a"
12427,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"fissure in the rock, which enabled them to pass far with very little"
12428,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"obstruction. This Rasselas considered as a good omen. ""Do not disturb"
12429,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"your mind,"" said Imlac, ""with other hopes or fears than reason may"
12430,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"suggest; if you are pleased with prognosticks of good, you will be"
12431,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"terrified, likewise, with tokens of evil, and your whole life will be a"
12432,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,prey to superstition. Whatever facilitates our work is more than an
12433,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"omen, it is a cause of success. This is one of those pleasing surprises"
12434,RASSELAS DISCOVERS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE.,"which often happen to active resolution. Many tilings, difficult to"

12706,THE PRINCE FINDS A WISE AND HAPPY MAN.,"government of the passions. His look was venerable, his action graceful,"
12707,THE PRINCE FINDS A WISE AND HAPPY MAN.,"his pronunciation clear, and his diction elegant. He showed, with great"

12709,THE PRINCE FINDS A WISE AND HAPPY MAN.,"degraded and debased, when the lower faculties predominate over the"

13108,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"The princess, in the mean time, insinuated herself into many families;"
13109,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"for there are few doors, through which liberality, joined with good-humour,"
13110,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,cannot find its way. The daughters of many houses were airy and
13111,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"cheerful, but Nekayah had been too long accustomed to the conversation"
13112,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"of Imlac and her brother, to be much pleased with childish levity, and"
13113,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"prattle, which had no meaning. She found their thoughts narrow, their"
13114,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"wishes low, and their merriment often artificial. Their pleasures, poor"
13115,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"as they were, could not be preserved pure, but were imbittered by petty"
13116,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"competitions, and worthless emulation. They were always jealous of the"
13117,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"beauty of each other; of a quality to which solicitude can add nothing,"
13118,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,and from which detraction can take nothing away. Many were in love with
13119,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"triflers, like themselves, and many fancied that they were in love,"
13120,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"when, in truth, they were only idle. Their affection was not fixed on"
13121,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"sense or virtue, and, therefore, seldom ended but in vexation. Their"
13122,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"grief, however, like their joy, was transient; every thing floated in"
13123,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"their mind, unconnected with the past or future; so that one desire"
13124,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"easily gave way to another, as a second stone, cast into the water,"
13125,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,effaces and confounds the circles of the first.
13126,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,
13127,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"With these girls she played, as with inoffensive animals, and found them"
13128,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"proud of her countenance, and weary of her company."
13129,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,
13130,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"But her purpose was to examine more deeply, and her affability easily"
13131,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"persuaded the hearts that were swelling with sorrow, to discharge their"
13132,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"secrets in her ear: and those, whom hope flattered, or prosperity"
13133,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"delighted, often courted her to partake their pleasures."
13134,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,
13135,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,The princess and her brother commonly met in the evening in a private
13136,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"summer house, on the bank of the Nile, and related to each other the"
13137,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"occurrences of the day. As they were sitting together, the princess cast"
13138,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"her eyes upon the river that flowed before her. ""Answer,"" said she,"
13139,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"""great father of waters, thou that rollest thy floods through eighty"
13140,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"nations, to the invocations of the daughter of thy native king. Tell me,"
13141,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"if thou waterest, through all thy course, a single habitation from which"

13147,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"many families, where there was the fairest show of prosperity and peace,"
13148,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"and know not one house that is not haunted by some fury, that destroys"

13153,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"affluence. Poverty has, in large cities, very different appearances; it"
13154,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"is often concealed in splendour, and often in extravagance. It is the"
13155,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,care of a very great part of mankind to conceal their indigence from the
13156,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"rest; they support themselves by temporary expedients, and every day is"
13157,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,lost in contriving for the morrow.

13159,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"""This, however, was an evil, which, though frequent, I saw with less"

13161,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"more offended with my quickness to detect their wants, than pleased with"
13162,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"my readiness to succour them: and others, whose exigencies compelled"
13163,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"them to admit my kindness, have never been able to forgive their"
13164,THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.,"benefactress. Many, however, have been sincerely grateful, without the"

13176,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"likewise, is a little kingdom, torn with factions, and exposed to"
13177,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,revolutions. An unpractised observer expects the love of parents and
13178,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,children to be constant and equal; but this kindness seldom continues
13179,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,beyond the years of infancy; in a short time the children become rivals
13180,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"to their parents. Benefits are allayed by reproaches, and gratitude"
13181,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,debased by envy.
13182,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,
13183,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"""Parents and children seldom act in concert: each child endeavours to"
13184,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"appropriate the esteem, or fondness of the parents; and the parents,"
13185,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"with yet less temptation, betray each other to their children; thus some"
13186,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"place their confidence in the father, and some in the mother, and, by"

13189,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"""The opinions of children and parents, of the young and the old, are"

13191,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"expectation and experience, without crime or folly on either side. The"
13192,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"colours of life, in youth and age, appear different, as the face of"
13193,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"nature, in spring and winter. And how can children credit the assertions"
13194,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"of parents, which their own eyes show them to be false?"
13195,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,
13196,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"""Few parents act in such a manner, as much to enforce their maxims, by"
13197,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,the credit of their lives. The old man trusts wholly to slow contrivance
13198,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"and gradual progression: the youth expects to force his way by genius,"
13199,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"vigour, and precipitance. The old man pays regard to riches, and the"
13200,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,youth reverences virtue. The old man deifies prudence: the youth commits
13201,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"himself to magnanimity and chance. The young man, who intends no ill,"
13202,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"believes that none is intended, and, therefore, acts with openness and"
13203,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"candour: but his father, having suffered the injuries of fraud, is"
13204,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"impelled to suspect, and, too often, allured to practise it. Age looks"
13205,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"with anger on the temerity of youth, and youth with contempt on the"
13206,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"scrupulosity of age. Thus parents and children, for the greatest part,"
13207,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"live on to love less and less: and, if those whom nature has thus"
13208,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"closely united are the torments of each other, where shall we look for"

13214,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,
13215,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"""Domestick discord,"" answered she, ""is not inevitably and fatally"
13216,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,necessary; but yet it is not easily avoided. We seldom see that a whole
13217,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,family is virtuous: the good and evil cannot well agree: and the evil
13218,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"can yet less agree with one another: even the virtuous fall, sometimes,"
13219,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"to variance, when their virtues are of different kinds, and tending to"
13220,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"extremes. In general, those parents have most reverence who most deserve"

13223,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"""Many other evils infest private life. Some are the slaves of servants,"

13225,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"anxiety, by the caprice of rich relations, whom they cannot please, and"
13226,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"dare not offend. Some husbands are imperious, and some wives perverse:"
13227,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"and, as it is always more easy to do evil than good, though the wisdom"

13237,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"dream away their time without friendship, without fondness, and are"
13238,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"driven to rid themselves of the day, for which they have no use, by"
13239,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"childish amusements, or vitious delights. They act as beings under the"
13240,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"constant sense of some known inferiority, that fills their minds with"
13241,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"rancour, and their tongues with censure. They are peevish at home, and"
13242,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"malevolent abroad; and, as the outlaws of human nature, make it their"
13243,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"business and their pleasure to disturb that society, which debars them"
13244,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,from its privileges. To live without feeling or exciting sympathy; to be
13245,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"fortunate without adding to the felicity of others, or afflicted without"
13246,THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.,"tasting the balm of pity, is a state more gloomy than solitude: it is"

13260,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"prejudice, and supposed misery where she did not find it. ""Your"
13261,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"narrative,"" says he, ""throws yet a darker gloom upon the prospects of"
13262,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,futurity: the predictions of Imlac were but faint sketches of the evils
13263,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"painted by Nekayah. I have been lately convinced, that quiet is not the"
13264,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"daughter of grandeur, or of power: that her presence is not to be bought"
13265,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"by wealth, nor enforced by conquest. It is evident, that as any man acts"
13266,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"in a wider compass, he must be more exposed to opposition from enmity,"
13267,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"or miscarriage from chance; whoever has many to please or to govern,"
13268,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"must use the ministry of many agents, some of whom will be wicked, and"
13269,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"some ignorant; by some he will be misled, and by others betrayed. If he"
13270,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"gratifies one, he will offend another: those that are not favoured will"

13280,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"None, however attentive, can always discover that merit, which indigence"
13281,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"or faction may happen to obscure; and none, however powerful, can always"
13282,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"reward it. Yet, he that sees inferiour desert advanced above him, will"
13283,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"naturally impute that preference to partiality or caprice; and, indeed,"
13284,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"it can scarcely be hoped that any man, however magnanimous by nature, or"
13285,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"exalted by condition, will be able to persist, for ever, in the fixed"
13286,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,and inexorable justice of distribution; he will sometimes indulge his
13287,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"own affections, and sometimes those of his favourites; he will permit"
13288,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,some to please him who can never serve him; he will discover in those
13289,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"whom he loves, qualities which, in reality, they do not possess; and to"
13290,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"those, from whom he receives pleasure, he will, in his turn, endeavour"
13291,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"to give it. Thus will recommendations sometimes prevail, which were"

13313,DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.,"this, at least, may be maintained, that we do not always find visible"

13416,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"best for individuals, or a permanent and necessary duty must be the"
13417,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"cause of evil, and some must be inevitably sacrificed to the convenience"
13418,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"of others. In the estimate, which you have made of the two states, it"
13419,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"appears, that the incommodities of a single life are, in a great"
13420,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"measure, necessary and certain, but those of the conjugal state,"
13421,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,accidental and avoidable.

13423,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"""I cannot forbear to flatter myself, that prudence and benevolence will"

13425,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"general complaint. What can be expected, but disappointment and"
13426,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"repentance, from a choice made in the immaturity of youth, in the ardour"
13427,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"of desire, without judgment, without foresight, without inquiry after"

13433,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"civilities, go home, and dream of one another. Having little to divert"

13435,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"are apart, and, therefore, conclude that they shall be happy together."
13436,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"They marry, and discover what nothing but voluntary blindness before had"

13440,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"""From those early marriages proceeds, likewise, the rivalry of parents"
13441,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"and children; the son is eager to enjoy the world, before the father is"
13442,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"willing to forsake it, and there is hardly room, at once, for two"
13443,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"generations. The daughter begins to bloom, before the mother can be"

13449,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"jollity of youthful pleasures, life may be well enough supported,"
13450,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"without the help of a partner. Longer time will increase experience, and"
13451,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,wider views will allow better opportunities of inquiry and selection:
13452,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"one advantage, at least, will be certain; the parents will be visibly"

13454,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,
13455,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"""What reason cannot collect,"" said Nekayah, ""and what experiment has not"
13456,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"yet taught, can be known only from the report of others. I have been"
13457,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"told, that late marriages are not eminently happy. This is a question"
13458,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"too important to be neglected, and I have often proposed it to those,"
13459,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"whose accuracy of remark, and comprehensiveness of knowledge, made their"
13460,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"suffrages worthy of regard. They have generally determined, that it is"
13461,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"dangerous for a man and woman to suspend their fate upon each other, at"
13462,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"a time, when opinions are fixed, and habits are established; when"
13463,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,friendships have been contracted on both sides; when life has been
13464,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"planned into method, and the mind has long enjoyed the contemplation of"
13465,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,its own prospects.
13466,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,
13467,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"""It is scarcely possible that two, travelling through the world, under"
13468,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"the conduct of chance, should have been both directed to the same path,"
13469,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"and it will not often happen, that either will quit the track which"
13470,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,custom has made pleasing. When the desultory levity of youth has settled
13471,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"into regularity, it is soon succeeded by pride, ashamed to yield, or"
13472,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"obstinacy, delighting to contend. And, even though mutual esteem"
13473,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"produces mutual desire to please, time itself, as it modifies"
13474,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"unchangeably the external mien, determines, likewise, the direction of"
13475,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"the passions, and gives an inflexible rigidity to the manners. Long"
13476,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,customs are not easily broken: he that attempts to change the course of
13477,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"his own life, very often labours in vain; and how shall we do that for"
13478,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"others, which we are seldom able to do for ourselves!"""
13479,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,
13480,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"""But, surely,"" interposed the prince, ""you suppose the chief motive of"

13483,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,
13484,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"""Thus it is,"" said Nekayah, ""that philosophers are deceived. There are a"
13485,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"thousand familiar disputes, which reason can never decide; questions"
13486,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"that elude investigation, and make logick ridiculous; cases where"
13487,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"something must be done, and where little can be said. Consider the state"
13488,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"of mankind, and inquire how few can be supposed to act, upon any"
13489,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"occasions, whether small or great, with all the reasons of action"
13490,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"present to their minds. Wretched would be the pair, above all names of"

13494,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"""Those who marry at an advanced age, will, probably, escape the"

13496,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"they will be likely to leave them, ignorant and helpless, to a"
13497,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"guardian's mercy; or, if that should not happen, they must, at least, go"

13503,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"convenience of uniting with manners pliant, and minds susceptible of new"
13504,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"impressions, which might wear away their dissimilitudes by long"
13505,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"cohabitation, as soft bodies, by continual attrition, conform their"

13510,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,
13511,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"""The union of these two affections,"" said Rasselas, ""would produce all"
13512,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"that could be wished. Perhaps there is a time, when marriage might unite"

13515,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,
13516,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"""Every hour,"" answered the princess, ""confirms my prejudice in favour of"
13517,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"the position, so often uttered by the mouth of Imlac: 'That nature sets"
13518,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"her gifts on the right hand and on the left.' Those conditions, which"
13519,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"flatter hope and attract desire, are so constituted, that, as we"
13520,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"approach one, we recede from another. There are goods so opposed, that"
13521,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,"we cannot seize both, but, by too much prudence, may pass between them,"
13522,THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE CONTINUED.,at too great a distance to reach either. This is often the fate of long

13893,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"Nekayah, being thus reconciled to herself, found, that no evil is"
13894,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"insupportable, but that which is accompanied with consciousness of"
13895,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"wrong. She was, from that time, delivered from the violence of"
13896,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"tempestuous sorrow, and sunk into silent pensiveness and gloomy"
13897,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"tranquillity. She sat, from morning to evening, recollecting all that"
13898,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"had been done or said by her Pekuah; treasured up, with care, every"
13899,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"trifle on which Pekuah had set an accidental value, and which might"
13900,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,recall to mind any little incident or careless conversation. The
13901,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"sentiments of her, whom she now expected to see no more, were treasured"
13902,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"in her memory as rules of life, and she deliberated to no other end,"
13903,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"than to conjecture, on any occasion, what would have been the opinion"
13904,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,and counsel of Pekuah.
13905,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,
13906,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"The women, by whom she was attended, knew nothing of her real condition,"
13907,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"and, therefore, she could not talk to them, but with caution and"
13908,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"reserve. She began to remit her curiosity, having no great care to"
13909,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,collect notions which she had no convenience of uttering. Rasselas
13910,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"endeavoured first to comfort, and afterwards to divert her; he hired"
13911,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"musicians, to whom she seemed to listen, but did not hear them, and"
13912,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"procured masters, to instruct her in various arts, whose lectures, when"
13913,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"they visited her again, were again to be repeated. She had lost her"
13914,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"taste of pleasure, and her ambition of excellence. And her mind, though"

13921,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,less and less willing to come into her presence. She observed his

13923,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"""to confound impatience with resentment, or to suppose, that I charge"
13924,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"you with negligence, because I repine at your unsuccessfulness. I do not"
13925,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"much wonder at your absence; I know that the unhappy are never pleasing,"
13926,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,and that all naturally avoid the contagion of misery. To hear complaints
13927,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"is wearisome alike to the wretched and the happy; for who would cloud,"
13928,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"by adventitious grief, the short gleams of gaiety which life allows us?"
13929,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"or who, that is struggling under his own evils, will add to them the"

13950,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"allow that what satisfaction this world can afford, must arise from the"
13951,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"conjunction of wealth, knowledge, and goodness. Wealth is nothing, but"

13967,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"when the first night came upon them, supposed that day would never"
13968,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"return. When the clouds of sorrow gather over us, we see nothing beyond"
13969,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"them, nor can imagine how they will be dispelled; yet a new day"
13970,THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.,"succeeded to the night, and sorrow is never long without a dawn of ease."

14038,THE PRINCESS HEARS NEWS OF PEKUAH.,"fortress, on the extremity of Egypt. The Arab, whose revenue was"
14039,THE PRINCESS HEARS NEWS OF PEKUAH.,"plunder, was willing to restore her, with her two attendants, for two"

14041,THE PRINCESS HEARS NEWS OF PEKUAH.,
14042,THE PRINCESS HEARS NEWS OF PEKUAH.,The price was no subject of debate. The princess was in ecstasies when
14043,THE PRINCESS HEARS NEWS OF PEKUAH.,"she heard that her favourite was alive, and might so cheaply be"

14117,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,
14118,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"""We were received into a large tent, where we found women, who had"
14119,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,attended their husbands in the expedition. They set before us the
14120,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"supper, which they had provided, and I ate rather to encourage my maids"
14121,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,than to comply with any appetite of my own. When the meat was taken
14122,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"away, they spread the carpets for repose. I was weary, and hoped to"
14123,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"find, in sleep, that remission of distress which nature seldom denies."
14124,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"Ordering myself, therefore, to be undressed, I observed that the women"
14125,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"looked submissively attended. When my upper vest was taken off, they"
14126,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"were, apparently, struck with the splendour of my clothes, and one of"
14127,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"them timorously laid her hand upon the embroidery. She then went out,"
14128,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"and, in a short time, came back with another woman, who seemed to be of"
14129,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"higher rank and greater authority. She did, at her entrance, the usual"
14130,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"act of reverence, and, taking me by the hand, placed me in a smaller"
14131,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"tent, spread with finer carpets, where I spent the night quietly with my"
14132,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,maids.
14133,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,
14134,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"""In the morning, as I was sitting on the grass, the chief of the troop"
14135,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"came towards me. I rose up to receive him, and he bowed with great"
14136,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"respect. 'Illustrious lady,' said he, 'my fortune is better than I had"
14137,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"presumed to hope; I am told, by my women, that I have a princess in my"
14138,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"camp.' 'Sir,' answered I, 'your women have deceived themselves and you;"
14139,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"I am not a princess, but an unhappy stranger, who intended soon to have"
14140,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"left this country, in which I am now to be imprisoned for ever.'"
14141,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"'Whoever, or whencesoever, you are,' returned the Arab, 'your dress, and"
14142,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"that of your servants, show your rank to be high, and your wealth to be"
14143,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"great. Why should you, who can so easily procure your ransome, think"
14144,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,yourself in danger of perpetual captivity? The purpose of my incursions
14145,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"is to increase my riches, or, more properly, to gather tribute. The sons"
14146,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,of Ishmael are the natural and hereditary lords of this part of the
14147,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"continent, which is usurped by late invaders, and low-born tyrants, from"
14148,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"whom we are compelled to take, by the sword, what is denied to justice."
14149,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,The violence of war admits no distinction: the lance that is lifted at
14150,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"guilt and power, will, sometimes, fall on innocence and gentleness.'"
14151,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,
14152,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"""'How little,' said I, 'did I expect that yesterday it should have"
14153,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,fallen upon me!'
14154,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,
14155,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"""'Misfortunes,' answered the Arab, 'should always be expected. If the"
14156,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"eye of hostility could learn reverence or pity, excellence, like yours,"
14157,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,had been exempt from injury. But the angels of affliction spread their
14158,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"toils alike for the virtuous and the wicked, for the mighty and the"
14159,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,mean. Do not be disconsolate: I am not one of the lawless and cruel
14160,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,rovers of the desert; I know the rules of civil life: I will fix your
14161,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"ransome, give a passport to your messenger, and perform my stipulation,"
14162,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,with nice punctuality.'
14163,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,
14164,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"""You will easily believe, that I was pleased with his courtesy: and,"
14165,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"finding, that his predominant passion was desire of money, I began now"
14166,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"to think my danger less, for I knew that no sum would be thought too"
14167,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"great for the release of Pekuah. I told him, that he should have no"
14168,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"reason to charge me with ingratitude, if I was used with kindness, and"
14169,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"that any ransome, which could be expected for a maid of common rank,"
14170,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,would be paid; but that he must not persist to rate me as a princess. He
14171,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"said he would consider what he should demand, and then, smiling, bowed"
14172,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,and retired.
14173,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,
14174,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"""Soon after the women came about me, each contending to be more"
14175,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"officious than the other, and my maids, themselves, were served with"
14176,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,reverence. We travelled onwards by short journeys. On the fourth day the
14177,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"chief told me, that my ransome must be two hundred ounces of gold; which"
14178,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"I not only promised him, but told him, that I would add fifty more, if I"
14179,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,and my maids were honourably treated.
14180,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,
14181,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"""I never knew the power of gold before. From that time, I was the leader"
14182,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"of the troop. The march of every day was longer, or shorter, as I"
14183,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"commanded, and the tents were pitched where I chose to rest. We now had"
14184,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"camels, and other conveniencies for travel; my own women were always at"
14185,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"my side, and I amused myself with observing the manners of the vagrant"
14186,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"nations, and with viewing remains of ancient edifices, with which these"
14187,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"deserted countries appear to have been, in some distant age, lavishly"
14188,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,embellished.
14189,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,
14190,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"""The chief of the band was a man far from illiterate: he was able to"
14191,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"travel by the stars, or the compass, and had marked, in his erratick"
14192,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"expeditions, such places as are most worthy the notice of a passenger."
14193,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"He observed to me, that buildings are always best preserved in places"
14194,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"little frequented, and difficult of access: for, when once a country"
14195,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"declines from its primitive splendour, the more inhabitants are left,"
14196,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,the quicker ruin will be made. Walls supply stones more easily than
14197,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"quarries, and palaces and temples will be demolished, to make stables of"
14198,THE ADVENTURES OF THE LADY PEKUAH.,"granite, and cottages of porphyry."

14204,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"""We wandered about, in this manner, for some weeks, whether, as our"
14205,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"chief pretended, for my gratification, or, as I rather suspected, for"
14206,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"some convenience of his own. I endeavoured to appear contented, where"
14207,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"sullenness and resentment would have been of no use, and that endeavour"
14208,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,conduced much to the calmness of my mind; but my heart was always with
14209,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"Nekayah, and the troubles of the night much overbalanced the amusements"
14210,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"of the day. My women, who threw all their cares upon their mistress, set"
14211,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"their minds at ease, from the time when they saw me treated with"
14212,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"respect, and gave themselves up to the incidental alleviations of our"
14213,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"fatigue, without solicitude or sorrow. I was pleased with their"
14214,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"pleasure, and animated with their confidence. My condition had lost much"
14215,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"of its terrour, since I found that the Arab ranged the country merely to"
14216,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,get riches. Avarice is an uniform and tractable vice: other intellectual
14217,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,distempers are different in different constitutions of mind; that which
14218,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"sooths the pride of one, will offend the pride of another; but to the"
14219,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"favour of the covetous, there is a ready way: bring money, and nothing"
14220,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,is denied.
14221,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,
14222,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"""At last we came to the dwelling of our chief, a strong and spacious"
14223,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"house, built with stone, in an island of the Nile, which lies, as I was"
14224,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"told, under the tropick. 'Lady,' said the Arab, 'you shall rest, after"
14225,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"your journey, a few weeks, in this place, where you are to consider"
14226,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"yourself as sovereign. My occupation is war; I have, therefore, chosen"
14227,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"this obscure residence, from which I can issue unexpected, and to which"
14228,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,I can retire unpursued. You may now repose in security: here are few
14229,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"pleasures, but here is no danger.' He then led me into the inner"
14230,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"apartments, and seating me on the richest couch, bowed to the ground."
14231,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"His women, who considered me as a rival, looked on me with malignity;"
14232,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"but, being soon informed that I was a great lady, detained only for my"
14233,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"ransome, they began to vie with each other in obsequiousness and"
14234,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,reverence.
14235,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,
14236,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"""Being again comforted with new assurances of speedy liberty, I was, for"
14237,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"some days, diverted from impatience by the novelty of the place. The"
14238,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"turrets overlooked the country to a great distance, and afforded a view"
14239,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"of many windings of the stream. In the day, I wandered from one place to"
14240,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"another, as the course of the sun varied the splendour of the prospect,"
14241,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,and saw many things which I had never seen before. The crocodiles and
14242,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"river-horses, are common in this unpeopled region, and I often looked"
14243,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"upon them with terrour, though I knew that they could not hurt me. For"
14244,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"some time I expected to see mermaids and tritons, which, as Imlac has"
14245,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"told me, the European travellers have stationed in the Nile, but no such"
14246,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"beings ever appeared, and the Arab, when I inquired after them, laughed"
14247,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,at my credulity.
14248,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,
14249,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"""At night the Arab always attended me to a tower, set apart for"
14250,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"celestial observations, where he endeavoured to teach me the names and"
14251,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"courses of the stars. I had no great inclination to this study, but an"
14252,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"appearance of attention was necessary to please my instructer, who"
14253,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"valued himself for his skill; and, in a little while, I found some"
14254,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"employment requisite to beguile the tediousness of time, which was to be"
14255,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,passed always amidst the same objects. I was weary of looking in the
14256,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"morning, on things from which I had turned away weary in the evening. I,"
14257,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"therefore, was, at last, willing to observe the stars, rather than do"
14258,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"nothing, but could not always compose my thoughts, and was very often"
14259,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"thinking on Nekayah, when others imagined me contemplating the sky. Soon"
14260,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"after the Arab went upon another expedition, and then my only pleasure"
14261,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"was to talk with my maids, about the accident by which we were carried"
14262,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"away, and the happiness that we should all enjoy at the end of our"
14263,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"captivity."""
14264,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,
14265,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"""There were women in your Arab's fortress,"" said the princess, ""why did"
14266,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"you not make them your companions, enjoy their conversation, and partake"
14267,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"their diversions'? In a place, where they found business or amusement,"
14268,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"why should you alone sit corroded with idle melancholy? or, why could"
14269,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"not you bear, for a few months, that condition to which they were"
14270,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"condemned for life?"""
14271,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,
14272,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"""The diversions of the women,"" answered Pekuah, ""were only childish"
14273,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"play, by which the mind, accustomed to stronger operations, could not be"
14274,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,kept busy. I could do all which they delighted in doing by powers merely
14275,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"sensitive, while my intellectual faculties were flown to Cairo. They"
14276,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"ran, from room to room, as a bird hops, from wire to wire, in his cage."
14277,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"They danced for the sake of motion, as lambs frisk in a meadow. One"
14278,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"sometimes pretended to be hurt, that the rest might be alarmed; or hid"
14279,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"herself, that another might seek her. Part of their time passed in"
14280,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"watching the progress of light bodies, that floated on the river, and"
14281,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"part, in marking the various forms into which clouds broke in the sky."
14282,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,
14283,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"""Their business was only needlework in which I and my maids, sometimes"
14284,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,helped them; but you know that the mind will easily straggle from the
14285,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"fingers, nor will you suspect that captivity and absence from Nekayah"
14286,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,could receive solace from silken flowers.
14287,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,
14288,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"""Nor was much satisfaction to be hoped from their conversation: for of"
14289,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,what could they be expected to talk? They had seen nothing; for they had
14290,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"lived, from early youth, in that narrow spot: of what they had not seen"
14291,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"they could have no knowledge, for they could not read. They had no ideas"
14292,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"but of the few things that were within their view, and had hardly names"
14293,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,for any thing but their clothes and their food. As I bore a superiour
14294,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"character, I was often called to terminate their quarrels, which I"
14295,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,decided as equitably as I could. If it could have amused me to hear the
14296,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"complaints of each against the rest, I might have been often detained by"
14297,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"long stories; but the motives of their animosity were so small, that I"
14298,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"could not listen without intercepting the tale."""
14299,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,
14300,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"""How,"" said Rasselas, ""can the Arab, whom you represented as a man of"
14301,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"more than common accomplishments, take any pleasure in his seraglio,"
14302,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,when it is filled only with women like these? Are they exquisitely
14303,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"beautiful?"""
14304,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,
14305,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"""They do not,"" said Pekuah, ""want that unaffecting and ignoble beauty,"
14306,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"which may subsist without sprightliness or sublimity, without energy of"
14307,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"thought, or dignity of virtue. But to a man, like the Arab, such beauty"
14308,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"was only a flower, casually plucked, and carelessly thrown away."
14309,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"Whatever pleasures he might find among them, they were not those of"
14310,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"friendship or society. When they were playing about him, he looked on"
14311,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"them with inattentive superiority: when they vied for his regard, he"
14312,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"sometimes turned away disgusted. As they had no knowledge, their talk"
14313,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"could take nothing from the tediousness of life; as they had no choice,"
14314,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"their fondness, or appearance of fondness, excited in him neither pride"
14315,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,nor gratitude; he was not exalted in his own esteem by the smiles of a
14316,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"woman, who saw no other man, nor was much obliged by that regard, of"
14317,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"which he could never know the sincerity, and which he might often"
14318,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"perceive to be exerted, not so much to delight him, as to pain a rival."
14319,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"That which he gave, and they received, as love, was only a careless"
14320,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"distribution of superfluous time, such love as man can bestow upon that"
14321,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"which he despises, such as has neither hope nor fear, neither joy nor"
14322,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"sorrow."""
14323,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,
14324,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"""You have reason, lady, to think yourself happy,"" said Imlac, ""that you"
14325,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"have been thus easily dismissed. How could a mind, hungry for knowledge,"
14326,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"be willing, in an intellectual famine, to lose such a banquet as"
14327,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"Pekuah's conversation?"""
14328,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,
14329,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"""I am inclined to believe,"" answered Pekuah, ""that he was, for sometime,"
14330,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"in suspense; for, notwithstanding his promise, whenever I proposed to"
14331,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"despatch a messenger to Cairo, he found some excuse for delay. While I"
14332,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"was detained in his house, he made many incursions into the neighbouring"
14333,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"countries, and, perhaps, he would have refused to discharge me, had his"
14334,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"plunder been equal to his wishes. He returned always courteous, related"
14335,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"his adventures, delighted to hear my observations, and endeavoured to"
14336,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,advance my acquaintance with the stars. When I importuned him to send
14337,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"away my letters, he soothed me with professions of honour and sincerity;"
14338,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"and, when I could be no longer decently denied, put his troop again in"
14339,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"motion, and left me to govern in his absence. I was much afflicted by"
14340,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"this studied procrastination, and was sometimes afraid, that I should be"
14341,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"forgotten; that you would leave Cairo, and I must end my days in an"
14342,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,island of the Nile.

14344,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"""I grew, at last, hopeless and dejected, and cared so little to"
14345,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"entertain him, that he, for awhile, more frequently talked with my"
14346,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"maids. That he should fall in love with them, or with me, might have"
14347,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"been equally fatal, and I was not much pleased with the growing"
14348,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"friendship. My anxiety was not long; for, as I recovered some degree of"
14349,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"cheerfulness, he returned to me, and I could not forbear to despise my"
14350,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,former uneasiness.
14351,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,
14352,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"""He still delayed to send for my ransome, and would, perhaps, never have"

14355,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"to prepare for our journey hither, like a man delivered from the pain of"
14356,THE ADVENTURES OF PEKUAH CONTINUED.,"an intestine conflict. I took leave of my companions in the house, who"

14392,THE HISTORY OF A MAN OF LEARNING.,"perceived that I had, every day, more of his confidence, and always"

14690,THEY DISCOURSE WITH AN OLD MAN.,friends and my rivals. Nothing is now of much importance; for I cannot
14691,THEY DISCOURSE WITH AN OLD MAN.,"extend my interest beyond myself. Youth is delighted with applause,"
14692,THEY DISCOURSE WITH AN OLD MAN.,"because it is considered, as the earnest of some future good, and"
14693,THEY DISCOURSE WITH AN OLD MAN.,"because the prospect of life is far extended; but to me, who am now"

14709,THEY DISCOURSE WITH AN OLD MAN.,"He rose and went away, leaving his audience not much elated with the"
14710,THEY DISCOURSE WITH AN OLD MAN.,"hope of long life. The prince consoled himself with remarking, that it"
14711,THEY DISCOURSE WITH AN OLD MAN.,was not reasonable to be disappointed by this account; for age had never
14712,THEY DISCOURSE WITH AN OLD MAN.,"been considered as the season of felicity, and, if it was possible to be"
14713,THEY DISCOURSE WITH AN OLD MAN.,"easy in decline and weakness, it was likely that the days of vigour and"

14742,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"The princess and Pekuah having talked in private of Imlac's astronomer,"
14743,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"thought his character at once so amiable and so strange, that they could"
14744,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,not be satisfied without a nearer knowledge; and Imlac was requested to
14745,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,find the means of bringing them together.
14746,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,
14747,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,This was somewhat difficult; the philosopher had never received any
14748,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"visits from women, though he lived in a city that had in it many"
14749,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"Europeans, who followed the manners of their own countries, and many,"
14750,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"from other parts of the world, that lived there with European liberty."
14751,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"The ladies would not be refused, and several schemes were proposed for"
14752,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,the accomplishment of their design. It was proposed to introduce them as
14753,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"strangers in distress, to whom the sage was always accessible; but,"
14754,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"after some deliberation, it appeared, that by this artifice, no"
14755,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"acquaintance could be formed, for their conversation would be short, and"
14756,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"they could not decently importune him often. ""This,"" said Rasselas, ""is"
14757,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,true; but I have yet a stronger objection against the misrepresentation
14758,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,of your state. I have always considered it as treason against the great
14759,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"republick of human nature, to make any man's virtues the means of"
14760,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"deceiving him, whether on great or little occasions. All imposture"
14761,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"weakens confidence, and chills benevolence. When the sage finds that you"
14762,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"are not what you seemed, he will feel the resentment natural to a man"
14763,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"who, conscious of great abilities, discovers that he has been tricked by"
14764,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"understandings meaner than his own, and, perhaps, the distrust, which he"
14765,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"can never afterwards wholly lay aside, may stop the voice of counsel,"

14769,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"To this no reply was attempted, and Imlac began to hope that their"

14771,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"found an honest pretence for a visit to the astronomer, for she would"
14772,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"solicit permission to continue, under him, the studies in which she had"
14773,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"been initiated by the Arab, and the princess might go with her, either"

14788,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"after a short deliberation, he consented to admit her, he could not"

14794,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"first civilities, he was timorous and bashful; but, when the talk became"
14795,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"regular, he recollected his powers, and justified the character which"
14796,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"Imlac had given. Inquiring of Pekuah, what could have turned her"
14797,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"inclination toward astronomy, he received from her a history of her"
14798,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"adventure at the pyramid, and of the time passed in the Arab's island."
14799,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"She told her tale with ease and elegance, and her conversation took"
14800,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,possession of his heart. The discourse was then turned to astronomy;
14801,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,Pekuah displayed what she knew: he looked upon her as a prodigy of
14802,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"genius, and entreated her not to desist from a study, which she had so"

14805,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"They came again and again, and were, every time, more welcome than"

14808,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"the clouds of solicitude vanished by degrees, as he forced himself to"

14814,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"whether he continued, or not, in the opinion of his preternatural"

14821,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"gradually, to delight in sublunary pleasures. He came early, and"
14822,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,departed late; laboured to recommend himself by assiduity and
14823,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"compliance; excited their curiosity after new arts, that they might"

14827,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"By long experience of his integrity and wisdom, the prince and his"

14837,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,be but remotely useful to mankind. I have purchased knowledge at the

14841,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"they have been accompanied with fear, disquiet, and scrupulosity; but,"
14842,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"even of these prerogatives, whatever they were, I have, since my"
14843,THE PRINCESS AND PEKUAH VISIT THE ASTRONOMER.,"thoughts have been diversified by more intercourse with the world, begun"

15183,LETTERS.,
15184,LETTERS.,"Sept. 25th, 1750."
15185,LETTERS.,
15186,LETTERS.,"DEAR SIR,--You have, as I find by every kind of evidence, lost an"
15187,LETTERS.,excellent mother; and I hope you will not think me incapable of
15188,LETTERS.,"partaking of your grief. I have a mother, now eighty-two years of age,"
15189,LETTERS.,"whom, therefore, I must soon lose, unless it please God that she rather"
15190,LETTERS.,should mourn for me. I read the letters in which you relate your
15191,LETTERS.,"mother's death to Mrs. Strahan, and think I do myself honour, when I"
15192,LETTERS.,"tell you that I read them with tears; but tears are neither to you, nor"
15193,LETTERS.,"to me, of any farther use, when once the tribute of nature has been"
15194,LETTERS.,"paid. The business of life summons us away from useless grief, and calls"
15195,LETTERS.,"us to the exercise of those virtues, of which we are lamenting our"
15196,LETTERS.,deprivation.
15197,LETTERS.,
15198,LETTERS.,"The greatest benefit which one friend can confer upon another, is to"
15199,LETTERS.,guard and excite and elevate his virtues. This your mother will still
15200,LETTERS.,"perform, if you diligently preserve the memory of her life, and of her"
15201,LETTERS.,"death: a life, so far as I can learn, useful, wise, and innocent; and a"
15202,LETTERS.,"death, resigned, peaceful, and holy. I cannot forbear to mention, that"
15203,LETTERS.,"neither reason nor revelation denies you to hope, that you may increase"
15204,LETTERS.,"her happiness, by obeying her precepts; and that she may, in her present"
15205,LETTERS.,"state, look, with pleasure, upon every act of virtue, to which her"
15206,LETTERS.,instructions or example have contributed. Whether this be more than a
15207,LETTERS.,"pleasing dream, or a just opinion of separate spirits, is, indeed, of no"
15208,LETTERS.,"great importance to us, when we consider ourselves as acting under the"
15209,LETTERS.,"eye of God: yet, surely, there is something pleasing in the belief, that"
15210,LETTERS.,"our separation from those, whom we love, is merely corporeal; and it may"
15211,LETTERS.,"be a great incitement to virtuous friendship, if it can be made"
15212,LETTERS.,"probable, that that union, which has received the divine approbation,"
15213,LETTERS.,shall continue to eternity.
15214,LETTERS.,
15215,LETTERS.,"There is one expedient, by which you may, in some degree, continue her"
15216,LETTERS.,presence. If you write down minutely what you remember of her from your
15217,LETTERS.,"earliest years, you will read it with great pleasure, and receive from"
15218,LETTERS.,"it many hints of soothing recollection, when time shall remove her yet"
15219,LETTERS.,"farther from you, and your grief shall be matured to veneration. To"
15220,LETTERS.,"this, however painful for the present, I cannot but advise you, as to a"
15221,LETTERS.,source of comfort and satisfaction in the time to come; for all comfort
15222,LETTERS.,"and all satisfaction is sincerely wished you by,"
15223,LETTERS.,

15234,SAM. JOHNSON.,"MADAM,--If you have really so good an opinion of me as you express, it"

15240,SAM. JOHNSON.,
15241,SAM. JOHNSON.,"I am afraid to make promises, even to myself; but I hope that the week"

15243,SAM. JOHNSON.,"done, what remains but pleasure? and where should pleasure be sought,"
15244,SAM. JOHNSON.,but under Mrs. Thrale's influence?
15245,SAM. JOHNSON.,
15246,SAM. JOHNSON.,"Do not blame me for a delay by which I must suffer so much, and by which"
15247,SAM. JOHNSON.,"I suffer alone. If you cannot think I am good, pray think I am mending,"

15254,SAM. JOHNSON.,
15255,SAM. JOHNSON.,"Madam,--Though I have been away so much longer than I purposed or"
15256,SAM. JOHNSON.,"expected, I have found nothing that withdraws my affections from the"
15257,SAM. JOHNSON.,"friends whom I left behind, or which makes me less desirous of reposing"
15258,SAM. JOHNSON.,"at that place, which your kindness and Mr. Thrale's allows me to call my"
15259,SAM. JOHNSON.,home.
15260,SAM. JOHNSON.,
15261,SAM. JOHNSON.,"Miss Lucy[a] is more kind and civil than I expected, and has raised my"
15262,SAM. JOHNSON.,"esteem by many excellencies, very noble and resplendent, though a little"
15263,SAM. JOHNSON.,discoloured by hoary virginity. Every thing else recalls to my
15264,SAM. JOHNSON.,"remembrance years, in which I proposed what, I am afraid, I have not"
15265,SAM. JOHNSON.,"done, and promised myself pleasure which I have not found. But complaint"
15266,SAM. JOHNSON.,can be of no use; and why then should I depress your hopes by my
15267,SAM. JOHNSON.,lamentations? I suppose it is the condition of humanity to design what
15268,SAM. JOHNSON.,"never will be done, and to hope what never will be obtained. But, among"
15269,SAM. JOHNSON.,"the vain hopes, let me not number the hope which I have, of being long,"

15287,IV.--TO THE SAME.,"Next day we came early to Lucy, who was, I believe, glad to see us. She"

15289,IV.--TO THE SAME.,"says, ""I was neither too proud nor too wise"" to gather them. I have"
15290,IV.--TO THE SAME.,"rambled a very little ""inter fontes et flumina nota,"" but I am not yet"
15291,IV.--TO THE SAME.,"well. They have cut down the trees in George lane. Evelyn, in his book"
15292,IV.--TO THE SAME.,"of Forest Trees, tells us of wicked men that cut down trees, and never"
15293,IV.--TO THE SAME.,prospered afterwards; yet nothing has deterred these audacious aldermen
15294,IV.--TO THE SAME.,"from violating the Hamadryads of George lane. As an impartial traveller,"
15295,IV.--TO THE SAME.,"I must however tell, that, in Stow street, where I left a draw-well, I"
15296,IV.--TO THE SAME.,"have found a pump; but the lading-well, in this ill fated George lane,"

15315,IV.--TO THE SAME.,"Rheumatism, which has been very troublesome, is grown better. I have not"
15316,IV.--TO THE SAME.,"yet seen Dr. Taylor, and July runs fast away. I shall not have much time"
15317,IV.--TO THE SAME.,"for him, if he delays much longer to come or send. Mr. Green, the"
15318,IV.--TO THE SAME.,"apothecary, has found a book, which tells who paid levies in our parish,"
15319,IV.--TO THE SAME.,"and how much they paid, above a hundred years ago. Do you not think we"
15320,IV.--TO THE SAME.,study this book hard? Nothing is like going to the bottom of things.
15321,IV.--TO THE SAME.,"Many families, that paid the parish-rates, are now extinct, like the"
15322,IV.--TO THE SAME.,"race of Hercules: ""Pulvis et umbra sumus."" What is nearest us, touches"
15323,IV.--TO THE SAME.,"us most. The passions rise higher at domestick, than at imperial,"

15328,IV.--TO THE SAME.,"Do not imagine, madam, that I wrote this letter for the sake of these"

15357,VII.--TO THE SAME.,else might I paint the beauties of my native plains; might I tell of the

15359,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"crossed the Staffordshire canal, one of the great efforts of human"

15364,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"till the chaise stopped at Ashbourne, at Ashbourne in the Peak. Let not"
15365,VII.--TO THE SAME.,the barren name of the Peak terrify you; I have never wanted

15381,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15382,VII.--TO THE SAME.,_Toujours_ strawberries and cream.
15383,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15384,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Dr. Taylor is much better, and my rheumatism is less painful. Let me"
15385,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"hear, in return, as much good of you and of Mrs. Salusbury. You despise"
15386,VII.--TO THE SAME.,the Dog and Duck: things that are at hand are always slighted. I
15387,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"remember that Dr. Grevil, of Gloucester, sent for that water when his"

15392,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Why Bromefield, supposing that a lotion can do good, should despise"

15407,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"not that I have any thing to tell, but that, by showing how much I am"
15408,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"employed upon you, I hope to keep you from forgetting me."
15409,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15410,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Doctor Taylor asked me, this morning, on what I was thinking; and I was"
15411,VII.--TO THE SAME.,thinking on Lucy. I hope Lucy is a good girl. But she cannot yet be so
15412,VII.--TO THE SAME.,good as Queeney. I have got nothing yet for Queeney's cabinet.
15413,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15414,VII.--TO THE SAME.,I hope dear Mrs. Salusbury grows no worse. I wish any thing could be
15415,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"found that would make her better. You must remember her admonition, and"
15416,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"bustle in the brewhouse. When I come, you may expect to have your hands"
15417,VII.--TO THE SAME.,full with all of us.
15418,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15419,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Our bulls and cows are all well, but we yet hate the man that had seen a"
15420,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"bigger bull. Our deer have died, but many are left. Our waterfall, at"
15421,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the garden, makes a great roaring this wet weather."
15422,VII.--TO THE SAME.,

15429,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15430,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"DEAR MADAM,--I am sorry that none of your letters bring better news of"
15431,VII.--TO THE SAME.,the poor dear lady. I hope her pain is not great. To have a disease
15432,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"confessedly incurable, and apparently mortal, is a very heavy"
15433,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"affliction; and it is still more grievous, when pain is added to"
15434,VII.--TO THE SAME.,despair.
15435,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15436,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Every thing else in your letter pleased me very well, except that when I"
15437,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"come I entreat I may not be flattered, as your letters flatter me. You"
15438,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"have read of heroes and princes ruined by flattery, and, I question, if"
15439,VII.--TO THE SAME.,any of them had a flatterer so dangerous as you. Pray keep strictly to
15440,VII.--TO THE SAME.,your character of governess.
15441,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15442,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I cannot yet get well; my nights are flatulent and unquiet, but my days"
15443,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"are tolerably easy, and Taylor says, that I look much better than when I"
15444,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"came hither. You will see when I come, and I can take your word."
15445,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15446,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Our house affords no revolutions. The great bull is well. But I write,"
15447,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"not merely to think on you, for I do that without writing, but to keep"
15448,VII.--TO THE SAME.,you a little thinking on me. I perceive that I have taken a broken piece
15449,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of paper, but that is not the greatest fault that you must forgive in,"

15458,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"on which you will receive this, I shall have it before I leave"
15459,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Ashbourne. I am to go to Lichfield on Wednesday, and purpose to find my"
15460,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"way to London, through Birmingham and Oxford."
15461,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15462,VII.--TO THE SAME.,I was yesterday at Chatsworth. It is a very fine house. I wish you had
15463,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"been with me to see it; for then, as we are apt to want matter of talk,"
15464,VII.--TO THE SAME.,we should have gained something new to talk on. They complimented me
15465,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with playing the fountain, and opening the cascade. But I am of my"
15466,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"friend's opinion, that when one has seen the ocean, cascades are but"
15467,VII.--TO THE SAME.,little things.
15468,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15469,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I am in hope of a letter to-day from you or Queeney, but the post has"

15477,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15478,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"MADAM,--The inequalities of human life have always employed the"
15479,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"meditation of deep thinkers, and I cannot forbear to reflect on the"
15480,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"difference between your condition and my own. You live upon mock-turtle,"
15481,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and stewed rumps of beef; I dined, yesterday, upon crumpets. You sit"
15482,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with parish officers, caressing and caressed, the idol of the table, and"
15483,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the wonder of the day. I pine in the solitude of sickness, not bad"
15484,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"enough to be pitied, and not well enough to be endured. You sleep away"
15485,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the night, and laugh, or scold away the day. I cough and grumble, and"
15486,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"grumble and cough. Last night was very tedious, and this day makes no"
15487,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"promises of much ease. However, I have this day put on my shoe, and hope"
15488,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"that gout is gone. I shall have only the cough to contend with, and I"
15489,VII.--TO THE SAME.,doubt whether I shall get rid of that without change of place. I caught
15490,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"cold in the coach as I went away, and am disordered by very little"
15491,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"things. Is it accident or age? I am, dearest madam, &c."

15496,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"March 17, 1773."
15497,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15498,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"DEAR MADAM,--To tell you that I am sorry, both for the poor lady and for"
15499,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"you, is useless. I cannot help either of you. The weakness of mind is,"
15500,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"perhaps, only a casual interruption or intermission of the attention,"
15501,VII.--TO THE SAME.,such as we all suffer when some weighty care or urgent calamity has
15502,VII.--TO THE SAME.,possession of the mind. She will compose herself. She is unwilling to
15503,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"die, and the first conviction of approaching death raised great"
15504,VII.--TO THE SAME.,perturbation. I think she has but very lately thought death close at
15505,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"hand. She will compose herself to do that as well as she can, which"
15506,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"must, at last, be done. May she not want the divine assistance!"
15507,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15508,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"You, madam, will have a great loss; a greater than is common in the loss"
15509,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of a parent. Fill your mind with hope of her happiness, and turn your"
15510,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"thoughts first to him who gives and takes away, in whose presence the"
15511,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"living and dead are standing together. Then remember, that when this"
15512,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"mournful duty is paid, others yet remain of equal obligation, and, we"
15513,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"may hope, of less painful performance. Grief is a species of idleness,"
15514,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and the necessity of attention to the present preserves us, by the"
15515,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"merciful disposition of providence, from being lacerated and devoured by"
15516,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sorrow for the past. You must think on your husband and your children,"
15517,VII.--TO THE SAME.,and do what this dear lady has done for you.
15518,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15519,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Not to come to town while the great struggle continues is, undoubtedly,"
15520,VII.--TO THE SAME.,well resolved. But do not harass yourself into danger; you owe the care
15521,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of your health to all that love you, at least to all whom it is your"
15522,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"duty to love. You cannot give such a mother too much, if you do not give"
15523,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"her what belongs to another. I am, &c."

15529,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15530,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"DEAR MADAM,--Hope is more pleasing than fear, but not less fallacious;"
15531,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"you know, when you do not try to deceive yourself, that the disease,"
15532,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which at last is to destroy, must be gradually growing worse, and that"
15533,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"it is vain to wish for more than, that the descent to death may be slow"
15534,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and easy. In this wish I join with you, and hope it will be granted."
15535,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Dear, dear lady, whenever she is lost she will be missed, and whenever"
15536,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"she is remembered she will be lamented. Is it a good or an evil to me,"
15537,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"that she now loves me? It is surely a good; for you will love me better,"
15538,VII.--TO THE SAME.,and we shall have a new principle of concord; and I shall be happier
15539,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with honest sorrow, than with sullen indifference: and far happier still"
15540,VII.--TO THE SAME.,than with counterfeited sympathy.
15541,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15542,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I am reasoning upon a principle very far from certain, a confidence of"
15543,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"survivance. You or I, or both, may be called into the presence of the"
15544,VII.--TO THE SAME.,supreme judge before her. I have lived a life of which I do not like the
15545,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"review. Surely I shall, in time, live better."
15546,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15547,VII.--TO THE SAME.,I sat down with an intention to write high compliments; but my thoughts
15548,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"have taken another course, and some other time must now serve to tell"
15549,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"you with what other emotions, benevolence, and fidelity, I am, &c."

15554,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"May 17, 1773."
15555,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15556,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"MADAM,--Never imagine that your letters are long; they are always too"
15557,VII.--TO THE SAME.,short for my curiosity. I do not know that I was ever content with a
15558,VII.--TO THE SAME.,single perusal.
15559,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15560,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Of dear Mrs. Salusbury I never expect much better news than you send me;
15561,VII.--TO THE SAME.,_de pis en pis_ is the natural and certain course of her dreadful
15562,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"malady. I am content, when it leaves her ease enough for the exercise of"
15563,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"her mind. Why should Mr. **** suppose, that what I took the liberty of"
15564,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"suggesting, was concerted with you? He does not know how much I revolve"
15565,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"his affairs, and how honestly I desire his prosperity. I hope he has let"
15566,VII.--TO THE SAME.,the hint take some hold of his mind.
15567,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15568,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Your declaration to Miss **** is more general than my opinions allow. I
15569,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"think an unlimited promise of acting by the opinion of another so wrong,"
15570,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"that nothing, or hardly anything, can make it right. All unnecessary"
15571,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"vows are folly, because they suppose a prescience of the future which"
15572,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"has not been given us. They are, I think, a crime, because they resign"
15573,VII.--TO THE SAME.,that life to chance which God has given us to be regulated by reason;
15574,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and superinduce a kind of fatality, from which it is the great privilege"
15575,VII.--TO THE SAME.,of our nature to be free. Unlimited obedience is due only to the
15576,VII.--TO THE SAME.,universal father of heaven and earth. My parents may be mad and foolish;
15577,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"may be wicked and malicious; may be erroneously religious, or absurdly"
15578,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"scrupulous. I am not bound to compliance with mandates, either positive"
15579,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"or negative, which either religion condemns, or reason rejects. There"
15580,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"wanders about the world a wild notion, which extends over marriage more"
15581,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"than over any other transaction. If Miss **** followed a trade, would it"
15582,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"be said, that she was bound, in conscience, to give or refuse credit at"
15583,VII.--TO THE SAME.,her father's choice? And is not marriage a thing in which she is more
15584,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"interested, and has, therefore, more right of choice? When I may suffer"
15585,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"for my own crimes, when I may be sued for my own debts, I may judge, by"
15586,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"parity of reason, for my own happiness. The parent's moral right can"
15587,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"arise only from his kindness, and his civil right only from his money."
15588,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15589,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Conscience cannot dictate obedience to the wicked, or compliance with"
15590,VII.--TO THE SAME.,the foolish; and of interest mere prudence is the judge.
15591,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15592,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"If the daughter is bound without a promise, she promises nothing;"
15593,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and if she is not bound, she promises too much."
15594,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15595,VII.--TO THE SAME.,What is meant by tying up money in trade I do not understand No money is
15596,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"so little tied, as that which is employed in trade. Mr. ****, perhaps,"
15597,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"only means, that in consideration of money to be advanced, he will"
15598,VII.--TO THE SAME.,oblige his son to be a trader. This is reasonable enough. Upon ten
15599,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"thousand pounds, diligently occupied, they may live in great plenty and"
15600,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"splendour, without the mischiefs of idleness."
15601,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15602,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I can write a long letter, as well as my mistress; and shall be glad"
15603,VII.--TO THE SAME.,that my long letters may be as welcome as hers.
15604,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15605,VII.--TO THE SAME.,My nights are grown again very uneasy and troublesome. I know not that
15606,VII.--TO THE SAME.,the country will mend them; but I hope your company will mend my days.
15607,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Though I cannot now expect much attention, and would not wish for more"
15608,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"than can be spared from the poor dear lady, yet I shall see you and hear"
15609,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"you every now and then; and to see and hear you, is always to hear wit,"
15610,VII.--TO THE SAME.,and to see virtue.
15611,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15612,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I shall I hope, see you to-morrow, and a little on the two next days;"
15613,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and with that little I must, for the present, try to be contented. I am,"

15618,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15619,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"August 12, 1773."
15620,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15621,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"DEAR MADAM,--We left London on Friday, the 6th, not very early, and"
15622,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"travelled, without any memorable accident, through a country which I had"
15623,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"seen before. In the evening I was not well, and was forced to stop at"
15624,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Stilton, one stage short of Stamford, where we intended to have lodged."
15625,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15626,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"On the 7th we passed through Stamford and Grantham, and dined at Newark,"
15627,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"where I had only time to observe, that the market-place was uncommonly"
15628,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"spacious and neat. In London, we should call it a square, though the"
15629,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sides were neither straight nor parallel. We came, at night, to"
15630,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Doncaster, and went to church in the morning, where Chambers found the"
15631,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"monument of Robert of Doncaster, who says on his stone something like"
15632,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"this:--What I gave, that I have; what I spent, that I had; what I left,"
15633,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"that I lost.--So saith Robert of Doncaster, who reigned in the world"
15634,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sixty-seven years, and all that time lived not one. Here we were invited"
15635,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"to dinner, and, therefore, made no great haste away."
15636,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15637,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"We reached York, however, that night; I was much disordered with old"
15638,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"complaints. Next morning we saw the minster, an edifice of loftiness and"
15639,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"elegance, equal to the highest hopes of architecture. I remember"
15640,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"nothing, but the dome of St. Paul's, that can be compared with the"
15641,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"middle walk. The chapter-house is a circular building, very stately,"
15642,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"but, I think, excelled by the chapter-house of Lincoln."
15643,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15644,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I then went to see the ruins of the abbey, which are almost vanished,"
15645,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and I remember nothing of them distinct. The next visit was to the gaol,"
15646,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which they call the castle; a fabrick built lately, such is terrestrial"
15647,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"mutability, out of the materials of the ruined abbey. The under gaoler"
15648,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"was very officious to show his fetters, in which there was no"
15649,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"contrivance. The head gaoler came in, and seeing me look, I suppose,"
15650,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"fatigued, offered me wine, and, when I went away, would not suffer his"
15651,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"servant to take money. The gaol is accounted the best in the kingdom,"
15652,VII.--TO THE SAME.,and you find the gaoler deserving of his dignity.
15653,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15654,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"We dined at York, and went on to Northallerton, a place of which I know"
15655,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"nothing, but that it afforded us a lodging on Monday night, and about"
15656,VII.--TO THE SAME.,two hundred and seventy years ago gave birth to Roger Ascham.
15657,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15658,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Next morning we changed our horses at Darlington, where Mr. Cornelius"
15659,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Harrison, a cousin-german of mine, was perpetual curate. He was the only"
15660,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"one of my relations who ever rose in fortune above penury, or in"
15661,VII.--TO THE SAME.,character above neglect.
15662,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15663,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"The church is built crosswise, with a fine spire, and might invite a"
15664,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"traveller to survey it; but I, perhaps, wanted vigour, and thought I"
15665,VII.--TO THE SAME.,wanted time.
15666,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15667,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"The next stage brought us to Durham, a place of which Mr. Thrale bade me"
15668,VII.--TO THE SAME.,take particular notice. The bishop's palace has the appearance of an old
15669,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"feudal castle, built upon an eminence, and looking down upon the river,"
15670,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"upon which was formerly thrown a drawbridge, as I suppose, to be raised"
15671,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"at night, lest the Scots should pass it."
15672,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15673,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"The cathedral has a massiness and solidity, such as I have seen in no"
15674,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"other place; it rather awes than pleases, as it strikes with a kind of"
15675,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"gigantick dignity, and aspires to no other praise than that of rocky"
15676,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"solidity and indeterminate duration. I had none of my friends resident,"
15677,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and, therefore, saw but little. The library is mean and scanty."
15678,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15679,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"At Durham, beside all expectation, I met an old friend: Miss Fordyce is"
15680,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"married there to a physician. We met, I think, with honest kindness on"
15681,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"both sides. I thought her much decayed, and having since heard that the"
15682,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"banker had involved her husband in his extensive ruin, I cannot forbear"
15683,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"to think, that I saw in her withered features more impression of sorrow"
15684,VII.--TO THE SAME.,than that of time--
15685,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15686,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"""Qua terra patet, sera regnat Erinnys."""
15687,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15688,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"He that wanders about the world sees new forms of human misery, and if"
15689,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"he chances to meet an old friend, meets a face darkened with troubles."
15690,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15691,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"On Tuesday night we came hither; yesterday I took some care of myself,"
15692,VII.--TO THE SAME.,and to-day I am _quite polite_. I have been taking a view of all that
15693,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"could be shown me, and find that all very near to nothing. You have"
15694,VII.--TO THE SAME.,often heard me complain of finding myself disappointed by books of
15695,VII.--TO THE SAME.,travels; I am afraid travel itself will end likewise in disappointment.
15696,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"One town, one country, is very like another: civilized nations have the"
15697,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"same customs, and barbarous nations have the same nature: there are,"
15698,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"indeed, minute discriminations both of places and manners, which,"
15699,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"perhaps, are not wanting of curiosity, but which a traveller seldom"
15700,VII.--TO THE SAME.,stays long enough to investigate and compare. The dull utterly neglect
15701,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"them; the acute see a little, and supply the rest with fancy and"
15702,VII.--TO THE SAME.,conjecture.
15703,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15704,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I shall set out again to-morrow; but I shall not, I am afraid, see"
15705,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Alnwick, for Dr. Percy is not there. I hope to lodge to-morrow night at"

15711,VII.--TO THE SAME.,your most humble servant.
15712,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15713,VII.--TO THE SAME.,I am pretty well.

15717,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Thus far I had written at Newcastle. I forgot to send it. I am now at

15725,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"DEAR MADAM,--On the 13th, I left Newcastle, and, in the afternoon, came"
15726,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"to Alnwick, where we were treated with great civility by the duke: I"
15727,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"went through the apartments, walked on the wall, and climbed the towers."
15728,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"That night we lay at Belford, and, on the next night, came to Edinburgh."
15729,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"On Sunday (15th) I went to the English chapel. After dinner, Dr."
15730,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Robertson came in, and promised to show me the place. On Monday I saw"
15731,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"their publick buildings: the cathedral, which I told Robertson I wished"
15732,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"to see, because it had once been a church; the courts of justice, the"
15733,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"parliament-house, the advocates' library, the repository of records, the"
15734,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"college, and its library, and the palace, particularly the old tower,"
15735,VII.--TO THE SAME.,where the king of Scotland seized David Rizzio in the queen's presence.
15736,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Most of their buildings are very mean; and the whole town bears some
15737,VII.--TO THE SAME.,resemblance to the old part of Birmingham.
15738,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15739,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Boswell has very handsome and spacious rooms, level with the ground, on"
15740,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"one side of the house, and, on the other, four stories high."
15741,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15742,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"At dinner, on Monday, were the dutchess of Douglas, an old lady, who"
15743,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"talks broad Scotch with a paralytick voice, and is scarcely understood"
15744,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"by her own countrymen; the lord chief baron, sir Adolphus Oughton, and"
15745,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"many more. At supper there was such a conflux of company, that I could"
15746,VII.--TO THE SAME.,scarcely support the tumult. I have never been well in the whole
15747,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"journey, and am very easily disordered."
15748,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15749,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"This morning I saw, at breakfast, Dr. Blacklock, the blind poet, who"
15750,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"does not remember to have seen light, and is read to, by a poor scholar,"
15751,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"in Latin, Greek, and French. He was, originally, a poor scholar himself."
15752,VII.--TO THE SAME.,I looked on him with reverence. Tomorrow our journey begins; I know not

15759,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15760,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Dear Madam,--It has so happened, that, though I am perpetually thinking"
15761,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"on you, I could seldom find opportunity to write; I have, in fourteen"
15762,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"days, sent only one letter; you must consider the fatigues of travel,"
15763,VII.--TO THE SAME.,and the difficulties encountered in a strange country.
15764,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15765,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"August 18th. I passed, with Boswell, the frith of Forth, and began our"
15766,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"journey; in the passage we observed an island, which I persuaded my"
15767,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"companions to survey. We found it a rock somewhat troublesome to climb,"
15768,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"about a mile long, and half a mile broad; in the middle were the ruins"
15769,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of an old fort, which had, on one of the stones,--""Maria Re. 1564."" It"
15770,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"had been only a blockhouse, one story high. I measured two apartments,"
15771,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of which the walls were entire, and found them twenty-seven feet long,"
15772,VII.--TO THE SAME.,and twenty-three broad. The rock had some grass and many thistles; both
15773,VII.--TO THE SAME.,cows and sheep were grazing. There was a spring of water. The name is
15774,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Inchkeith. Look on your maps. This visit took about an hour. We pleased
15775,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"ourselves with being in a country all our own, and then went back to the"
15776,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"boat, and landed at Kinghorn, a mean town; and, travelling through"
15777,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Kirkaldie, a very long town, meanly built, and Cowpar, which I could not"
15778,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"see, because it was night, we came late to St. Andrew's, the most"
15779,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"ancient of the Scotch universities, and once the see of the primate of"
15780,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Scotland. The inn was full; but lodgings were provided for us at the
15781,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"house of the professor of rhetorick, a man of elegant manners, who"
15782,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"showed us, in the morning, the poor remains of a stately cathedral,"
15783,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"demolished in Knox's reformation, and now only to be imagined, by"
15784,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"tracing its foundation, and contemplating the little ruins that are"
15785,VII.--TO THE SAME.,left. Here was once a religious house. Two of the vaults or cellars of
15786,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the sub-prior are even yet entire. In one of them lives an old woman,"
15787,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"who claims an hereditary residence in it, boasting that her husband was"
15788,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the sixth tenant of this gloomy mansion, in a lineal descent, and"
15789,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"claims, by her marriage with this lord of the cavern, an alliance with"
15790,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the Bruces. Mr. Boswell staid awhile to interrogate her, because he"
15791,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"understood her language; she told him, that she and her cat lived"
15792,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"together; that she had two sons somewhere, who might, perhaps, be dead;"
15793,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"that, when there were quality in the town, notice was taken of her, and"
15794,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"that now she was neglected, but did not trouble them. Her habitation"
15795,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"contained all that she had; her turf, for fire, was laid in one place,"
15796,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and her balls of coal-dust in another, but her bed seemed to be clean."
15797,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Boswell asked her, if she never heard any noises; but she could tell him"
15798,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of nothing supernatural, though she often wandered in the night among"
15799,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the graves and ruins; only she had, sometimes, notice, by dreams, of the"
15800,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"death of her relations. We then viewed the remains of a castle, on the"
15801,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"margin of the sea, in which the archbishops resided, and in which"
15802,VII.--TO THE SAME.,cardinal Beatoun was killed.
15803,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15804,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"The professors, who happened to be readout in the vacation, made a"
15805,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"publick dinner, and treated us very kindly and respectfully. They showed"
15806,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"us their colleges, in one of which there is a library that, for"
15807,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"luminousness and elegance, may vie, at least, with the new edifice at"
15808,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Streatham. But learning seems not to prosper among them; one of their
15809,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"colleges has been lately alienated, and one of their churches lately"
15810,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"deserted. An experiment was made of planting a shrubbery in the church,"
15811,VII.--TO THE SAME.,but it did not thrive.
15812,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15813,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Why the place should thus fall to decay, I know not; for education, such"
15814,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"as is here to be had, is sufficiently cheap. The term, or, as they call"
15815,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"it, their session, lasts seven months in the year, which the students of"
15816,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the highest rank and greatest expense, may pass here for twenty pounds,"
15817,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"in which are included board, lodging, books, and the continual"
15818,VII.--TO THE SAME.,instruction of three professors.
15819,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15820,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"20th. We left St. Andrew's, well satisfied with our reception, and,"
15821,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"crossing the frith of Tay, came to Dundee, a dirty, despicable town. We"
15822,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"passed, afterwards, through Aberbrothick, famous once for an abbey, of"
15823,VII.--TO THE SAME.,which there are only a few fragments left; but those fragments testify
15824,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"that the fabrick was once of great extent, and of stupendous"
15825,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"magnificence. Two of the towers are yet standing, though shattered; into"
15826,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"one of them Boswell climbed, but found the stairs broken: the way into"
15827,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the other we did not see, and had not time to search; I believe it might"
15828,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"be ascended, but the top, I think, is open."
15829,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15830,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"We lay at Montrose, a neat place, with a spacious area for the market,"
15831,VII.--TO THE SAME.,and an elegant town-house.
15832,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15833,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"21st. We travelled towards Aberdeen, another university, and, in the"
15834,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"way, dined at lord Monboddo's, the Scotch judge, who has lately written"
15835,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"a strange book about the origin of language, in which he traces monkeys"
15836,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"up to men, and says that, in some countries, the human species have"
15837,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"tails like other beasts. He inquired for these long-tailed men of Banks,"
15838,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and was not well pleased, that they had not been found in all his"
15839,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"peregrination. He talked nothing of this to me, and I hope we parted"
15840,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"friends; for we agreed pretty well, only we disputed in adjusting the"
15841,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"claims of merit between a shopkeeper of London, and a savage of the"
15842,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"American wildernesses. Our opinions were, I think, maintained, on both"
15843,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sides, without full conviction: Monboddo declared boldly for the savage;"
15844,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and I, perhaps, for that reason, sided with the citizen."
15845,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15846,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"We came late to Aberdeen, where I found my dear mistress's letter, and"
15847,VII.--TO THE SAME.,learned that all our little people were happily recovered of the
15848,VII.--TO THE SAME.,measles. Every part of your letter was pleasing.
15849,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15850,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"There are two cities of the name of Aberdeen: the old town, built about"
15851,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"a mile inland, once the see of a bishop, which contains the king's"
15852,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"college, and the remains of the cathedral; and the new town, which"
15853,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"stands, for the sake of trade, upon a frith or arm of the sea, so that"
15854,VII.--TO THE SAME.,ships rest against the quay.
15855,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15856,VII.--TO THE SAME.,The two cities have their separate magistrates; and the two colleges
15857,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"are, in effect, two universities, which confer degrees independently of"
15858,VII.--TO THE SAME.,each other.
15859,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15860,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"New Aberdeen is a large town, built almost wholly of that granite which"
15861,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"is used for the new pavement in London, which, hard as it is, they"
15862,VII.--TO THE SAME.,square with very little difficulty. Here I first saw the women in
15863,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"plaids. The plaid makes, at once, a hood and cloak, without cutting or"
15864,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sewing, merely by the manner of drawing the opposite sides over the"
15865,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"shoulders. The maids, at the inns, run over the house barefoot; and"
15866,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"children, not dressed in rags, go without shoes or stockings. Shoes are,"
15867,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"indeed, not yet in universal use; they came late into this country. One"
15868,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of the professors told us, as we were mentioning a fort, built by"
15869,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Cromwell, that the country owed much of its present industry to"
15870,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Cromwell's soldiers. They taught us, said he, to raise cabbage, and make"
15871,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"shoes. How they lived without shoes may yet be seen; but, in the passage"
15872,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"through villages, it seems to him, that surveys their gardens, that when"
15873,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"they had not cabbage, they had nothing."
15874,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15875,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Education is here of the same price as at St. Andrew's, only the session"
15876,VII.--TO THE SAME.,is but from the 1st of November to the 1st of April. The academical
15877,VII.--TO THE SAME.,buildings seem rather to advance than decline. They showed their
15878,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"libraries, which were not very splendid, but some manuscripts were so"
15879,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"exquisitely penned, that I wished my dear mistress to have seen them. I"
15880,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"had an unexpected pleasure, by finding an old acquaintance, now"
15881,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"professor of physick, in the king's college: we were, on both sides,"
15882,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"glad of the interview, having not seen, nor, perhaps, thought on one"
15883,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"another, for many years; but we had no emulation, nor had either of us"
15884,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"risen to the other's envy, and our old kindness was easily renewed. I"
15885,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"hope we shall never try the effect of so long an absence, and that I"
15886,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"shall always be, madam your, &c."

15892,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15893,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"DEAR MADAM,--August 23rd, I had the honour of attending the lord provost"
15894,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of Aberdeen, and was presented with the freedom of the city, not in a"
15895,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"gold box, but in good Latin. Let me pay Scotland one just praise! there"
15896,VII.--TO THE SAME.,was no officer gaping for a fee; this could have been said of no city on
15897,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the English side of the Tweed. I wore my patent of freedom, _pro more_,"
15898,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"in my hat, from the new town to the old, about a mile. I then dined with"
15899,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"my friend, the professor of physick, at his house, and saw the king's"
15900,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"college. Boswell was very angry, that the Aberdeen professors would not"
15901,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"talk. When I was at the English church, in Aberdeen, I happened to be"
15902,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"espied by lady Di. Middleton, whom I had sometime seen in London; she"
15903,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"told what she had seen to Mr. Boyd, lord Errol's brother, who wrote us"
15904,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"an invitation to lord Errol's house, called Slane's castle We went"
15905,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"thither on the next day, (24th of August,) and found a house, not old,"
15906,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"except but one tower, built on the margin of the sea, upon a rock,"
15907,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"scarce accessible from the sea; at one corner, a tower makes a"
15908,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"perpendicular continuation of the lateral surface of the rock, so that"
15909,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"it is impracticable to walk round; the house inclosed a square court,"
15910,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and on all sides within the court is a piazza, or gallery, two stories"
15911,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"high. We came in, as we were invited to dinner, and, after dinner,"
15912,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"offered to go; but lady Errol sent us word by Mr. Boyd, that if we went"
15913,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"before lord Errol came home, we must never be forgiven, and ordered out"
15914,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the coach to show us two curiosities. We were first conducted, by Mr."
15915,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Boyd, to Dunbuys, or the yellow rock. Dunbuys is a rock, consisting of"
15916,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"two protuberances, each, perhaps, one hundred yards round, joined"
15917,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"together by a narrow neck, and separated from the land by a very narrow"
15918,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"channel or gully. These rocks are the haunts of seafowl, whose clang,"
15919,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"though this is not their season, we heard at a distance. The eggs and"
15920,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the young are gathered here, in great numbers, at the time of breeding."
15921,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"There is a bird here, called a coot, which, though not much bigger than"
15922,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"a duck, lays a larger egg than a goose. We went then to see the Buller,"
15923,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"or Bouilloir, of Buchan: Buchan is the name of the district, and the"
15924,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Buller is a small creek, or gulf, into which the sea flows through an"
15925,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"arch of the rock. We walked round it, and saw it black, at a great"
15926,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"depth. It has its name from the violent ebullition of the water, when"
15927,VII.--TO THE SAME.,high winds or high tides drive it up the arch into the basin. Walking a
15928,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"little farther, I spied some boats, and told my companions that we would"
15929,VII.--TO THE SAME.,go into the Buller and examine it. There was no danger; all was calm; we
15930,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"went through the arch, and found ourselves in a narrow gulf, surrounded"
15931,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"by craggy rocks, of height not stupendous, but, to a mediterranean"
15932,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"visitor, uncommon. On each side was a cave, of which the fisherman knew"
15933,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"not the extent, in which smugglers hide their goods, and sometimes"
15934,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"parties of pleasure take a dinner. I am, &c."

15940,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15941,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"DEAREST MADAM,--I am now looking on the sea, from a house of sir"
15942,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Alexander Macdonald, in the isle of Skie. Little did I once think of"
15943,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"seeing this region of obscurity, and little did you once expect a"
15944,VII.--TO THE SAME.,salutation from this verge of European life. I have now the pleasure of
15945,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"going where nobody goes, and seeing what nobody sees. Our design is to"
15946,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"visit several of the smaller islands, and then pass over to the south-west"
15947,VII.--TO THE SAME.,of Scotland.
15948,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15949,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I returned from the sight of Buller's Buchan to lord Errol's, and,"
15950,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"having seen his library, had, for a time, only to look upon the sea,"
15951,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which rolled between us and Norway. Next morning, August 25th, we"
15952,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"continued our journey through a country not uncultivated, but so denuded"
15953,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of its woods, that, in all this journey, I had not travelled a hundred"
15954,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"yards between hedges, or seen five trees fit for the carpenter. A few"
15955,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"small plantations may be found, but I believe scarcely any thirty years"
15956,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"old; at least, they are all posterior to the union. This day we dined"
15957,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with a country-gentleman, who has in his grounds the remains of a"
15958,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Druid's temple, which, when it is complete, is nothing more than a"
15959,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"circle, or double circle, of stones, placed at equal distances, with a"
15960,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"flat stone, perhaps an altar, at a certain point, and a stone, taller"
15961,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"than the rest, at the opposite point. The tall stone is erected, I"
15962,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"think, at the south. Of these circles, there are many in all the"
15963,VII.--TO THE SAME.,unfrequented parts of the island. The inhabitants of these parts respect
15964,VII.--TO THE SAME.,them as memorials of the sculpture of some illustrious person. Here I
15965,VII.--TO THE SAME.,saw a few trees. We lay at Bamff.
15966,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15967,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"August 26th. We dined at Elgin, where we saw the ruins of a noble"
15968,VII.--TO THE SAME.,cathedral; the chapter-house is yet standing. A great part of Elgin is
15969,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"built with small piazzas to the lower story. We went on to Foris, over"
15970,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the heath where Macbeth met the witches, but had no adventure; only in"
15971,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the way we saw, for the first time, some houses with fruit-trees about"
15972,VII.--TO THE SAME.,them. The improvements of the Scotch are for immediate profit; they do
15973,VII.--TO THE SAME.,not yet think it quite worth their while to plant what will not produce
15974,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"something to be eaten, or sold, in a very little time. We rested at"
15975,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Foris.
15976,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15977,VII.--TO THE SAME.,A very great proportion of the people are barefoot; shoes are not yet
15978,VII.--TO THE SAME.,considered as necessaries of life. It is still the custom to send out
15979,VII.--TO THE SAME.,the sons of gentlemen without them into the streets and ways. There are
15980,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"more beggars than I have ever seen in England; they beg, if not"
15981,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"silently, yet very modestly."
15982,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15983,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Next day we came to Nairn, a miserable town, but a royal burgh, of which"
15984,VII.--TO THE SAME.,the chief annual magistrate is styled lord provost. In the neighbourhood
15985,VII.--TO THE SAME.,we saw the castle of the old thane of Cawdor. There is one ancient
15986,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"tower, with its battlements and winding stairs, yet remaining; the rest"
15987,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of the house is, though not modern, of later erection."
15988,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15989,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"On the 28th we went to Fort George, which is accounted the most regular"
15990,VII.--TO THE SAME.,fortification in the island. The major of artillery walked with us round
15991,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the walls, and showed us the principles upon which every part was"
15992,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"constructed, and the way in which it could be defended. We dined with"
15993,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the governour, sir Eyre Coote, and his officers. It was a very pleasant"
15994,VII.--TO THE SAME.,and instructive day; but nothing puts my honoured mistress out of my
15995,VII.--TO THE SAME.,mind.
15996,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
15997,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"At night we came to Inverness, the last considerable town in the north,"
15998,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"where we staid all the next day, for it was Sunday, and saw the ruins of"
15999,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"what is called Macbeth's castle. It never was a large house, but was"
16000,VII.--TO THE SAME.,strongly situated. From Inverness we were to travel on horseback.
16001,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16002,VII.--TO THE SAME.,August 30th. We set out with four horses. We had two highlanders to run
16003,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"by us, who were active, officious, civil, and hardy. Our journey was,"
16004,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"for many miles, along a military way, made upon the banks of Lough Ness,"
16005,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"a water about eighteen miles long, but not, I think, half a mile broad."
16006,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Our horses were not bad, and the way was very pleasant; the rock, out of"
16007,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which the road was cut, was covered with birch-trees, fern, and heath."
16008,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"The lake below was beating its bank by a gentle wind, and the rocks"
16009,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"beyond the water, on the right, stood sometimes horrid, and wild, and"
16010,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sometimes opened into a kind of bay, in which there was a spot of"
16011,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"cultivated ground, yellow with corn. In one part of the way we had trees"
16012,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"on both sides, for, perhaps, half a mile. Such a length of shade,"
16013,VII.--TO THE SAME.,perhaps Scotland cannot show in any other place.
16014,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16015,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"You are not to suppose, that here are to be any more towns or inns. We"
16016,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"came to a cottage, which they call the General's Hut, where we alighted"
16017,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"to dine, and had eggs and bacon, and mutton, with wine, rum, and"
16018,VII.--TO THE SAME.,whiskey. I had water.
16019,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16020,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"At a bridge over the river, which runs into the Ness the rocks rise on"
16021,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"three sides, with a direction almost perpendicular, to a great height;"
16022,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"they are, in part, covered with trees, and exhibit a kind of dreadful"
16023,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"magnificence:--standing like the barriers of nature, placed to keep"
16024,VII.--TO THE SAME.,different orders of being in perpetual separation. Near this bridge is
16025,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the fall of Fiers, a famous cataract, of which, by clambering over the"
16026,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"rocks, we obtained a view. The water was low, and, therefore, we had"
16027,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"only the pleasure of knowing that rain would make it, at once, pleasing"
16028,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and formidable; there will then be a mighty flood, foaming along a rocky"
16029,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"channel, frequently obstructed by protuberances, and exasperated by"
16030,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"reverberation, at last precipitated with a sudden descent, and lost in"
16031,VII.--TO THE SAME.,the depth of a gloomy chasm.
16032,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16033,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"We came, somewhat late, to Fort Augustus, where the lieutenant-governour"
16034,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"met us beyond the gates, and apologized that, at that hour, he could"
16035,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"not, by the rules of a garrison, admit us, otherwise than at a narrow"
16036,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"door, which only one can enter at a time. We were well entertained and"
16037,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"well lodged, and, next morning, after having viewed the fort, we pursued"
16038,VII.--TO THE SAME.,our journey.
16039,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16040,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Our way now lay over the mountains, which are not to be passed by"
16041,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"climbing them directly, but by traversing; so that, as we went forward,"
16042,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"we saw our baggage following us below, in a direction exactly contrary."
16043,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"There is, in these ways, much labour, but little danger, and, perhaps,"
16044,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"other places, of which very terrifick representations are made, are not,"
16045,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"in themselves, more formidable. These roads have all been made by hewing"
16046,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the rock away with pickaxes, or bursting it with gunpowder. The stones,"
16047,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"so separated, are often piled loose, as a wall by the wayside. We saw an"
16048,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"inscription, importing the year in which one of the regiments made two"
16049,VII.--TO THE SAME.,thousand yards of the road eastward.
16050,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16051,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"After tedious travel of some hours, we came to what, I believe, we must"
16052,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"call a village, a place where there were three huts built of turf; at"
16053,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"one of which we were to have our dinner and our bed, for we could not"
16054,VII.--TO THE SAME.,reach any better place that night. This place is called Enoch in
16055,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Glenmorrison. The house, in which we lodged, was distinguished by a"
16056,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"chimney, the rest had only a hole for the smoke. Here we had eggs, and"
16057,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"mutton, and a chicken, and a sausage, and rum. In the afternoon tea was"
16058,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"made by a very decent girl in a printed linen: she engaged me so much,"
16059,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"that I made her a present of Cocker's arithmetick. I am, &c."
16060,VII.--TO THE SAME.,

16062,VII.--TO THE SAME.,XXI.--To MRS. THRALE.
16063,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16064,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Skie, Sept. 14,1773."
16065,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16066,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"DEAREST MADAM,--The post, which comes but once a week into these parts,"
16067,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"is so soon to go, that I have not time to go on where I left off in my"
16068,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"last letter. I have been several days in the island of Raarsa, and am"
16069,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"now again in the isle of Skie, but at the other end of it."
16070,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16071,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Skie is almost equally divided between the two great families of
16072,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Macdonald and Macleod, other proprietors having only small districts."
16073,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"The two great lords do not know, within twenty square miles, the"
16074,VII.--TO THE SAME.,contents of their own territories.
16075,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16076,VII.--TO THE SAME.,--kept up but ill the reputation of highland hospitality; we are now
16077,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with Macleod, quite at the other end of the island, where there is a"
16078,VII.--TO THE SAME.,fine young gentleman and fine ladies. The ladies are studying Erse. I
16079,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"have a cold, and am miserably deaf, and am troublesome to lady Macleod;"
16080,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I force her to speak loud, but she will seldom speak loud enough."
16081,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16082,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Raarsa is an island about fifteen miles long and two broad, under the"
16083,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"dominion of one gentleman, who has three sons and ten daughters; the"
16084,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"eldest is the beauty of this part of the world, and has been polished at"
16085,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Edinburgh: they sing and dance, and, without expense, have upon their"
16086,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"table most of what sea, air, or earth can afford. I intended to have"
16087,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"written about Raarsa, but the post will not wait longer than while I"
16088,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"send my compliments to my dear master and little mistresses. I am, &c."
16089,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16090,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16091,VII.--TO THE SAME.,XXII.--To MRS. THRALE.
16092,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16093,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Skie, Sept. 21, 1773."
16094,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16095,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"DEAREST MADAM,--I am so vexed at the necessity of sending yesterday so"
16096,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"short a letter, that I purpose to get a long letter beforehand, by"
16097,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"writing something every day, which I may the more easily do, as a cold"
16098,VII.--TO THE SAME.,makes me now too deaf to take the usual pleasure in conversation. Lady
16099,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Macleod is very good to me; and the place, at which we now are, is"
16100,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"equal, in strength of situation, in the wildness of the adjacent"
16101,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"country, and in the plenty and elegance of the domestick entertainment,"
16102,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"to a castle in Gothick romances. The sea, with a little island, is"
16103,VII.--TO THE SAME.,before us; cascades play within view. Close to the house is the
16104,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"formidable skeleton of an old castle, probably Danish; and the whole"
16105,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"mass of building stands upon a protuberance of rock, inaccessible till"
16106,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of late, but by a pair of stairs on the seaside, and secure, in ancient"
16107,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"times, against any enemy that was likely to invade the kingdom of Skie."
16108,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16109,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Macleod has offered me an island; if it were not too far off, I should"
16110,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"hardly refuse it: my island would be pleasanter than Brighthelmstone, if"
16111,VII.--TO THE SAME.,you and my master could come to it; but I cannot think it pleasant to
16112,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"live quite alone,"
16113,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16114,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"""Oblitusque meorum, obliviscendus et illis."""
16115,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16116,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"That I should be elated, by the dominion of an island to forgetfulness"
16117,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of my friends at Streatham, I cannot believe, and I hope never to"
16118,VII.--TO THE SAME.,deserve that they should be willing to forget me.
16119,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16120,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"It has happened, that I have been often recognised in my journey, where"
16121,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I did not expect it. At Aberdeen, I found one of my acquaintance"
16122,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"professor of physick: turning aside to dine with a country-gentleman, I"
16123,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"was owned, at table, by one who had seen me at a philosophical lecture:"
16124,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"at Macdonald's I was claimed by a naturalist, who wanders about the"
16125,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"islands to pick up curiosities: and I had once, in London, attracted the"
16126,VII.--TO THE SAME.,notice of lady Macleod. I will now go on with my account.
16127,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16128,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"The highland girl made tea, and looked and talked not inelegantly; her"
16129,VII.--TO THE SAME.,father was by no means an ignorant or a weak man; there were books in
16130,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the cottage, among which were some volumes of Prideaux's Connexion: this"
16131,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"man's conversation we were glad of while we staid. He had been out, as"
16132,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"they call it, in forty-five, and still retained his old opinions. He was"
16133,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"going to America, because his rent was raised beyond what he thought"
16134,VII.--TO THE SAME.,himself able to pay.
16135,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16136,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"At night our beds were made, but we had some difficulty in persuading"
16137,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"ourselves to lie down in them, though we had put on our own sheets; at"
16138,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"last we ventured, and I slept very soundly in the vale of Glenmorrison,"
16139,VII.--TO THE SAME.,amidst the rocks and mountains. Next morning our landlord liked us so
16140,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"well, that he walked some miles with us for our company, through a"
16141,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"country so wild and barren, that the proprietor does not, with all his"
16142,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"pressure upon his tenants, raise more than four hundred pounds a year"
16143,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"for near one hundred square miles, or sixty thousand acres. He let us"
16144,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"know, that he had forty head of black cattle, a hundred goats, and a"
16145,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"hundred sheep, upon a farm that he remembered let at five pounds a year,"
16146,VII.--TO THE SAME.,but for which he now paid twenty. He told us some stories of their march
16147,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"into England. At last, he left us, and we went forward, winding among"
16148,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"mountains, sometimes green and sometimes naked, commonly so steep, as"
16149,VII.--TO THE SAME.,not easily to be climbed by the greatest vigour and activity: our way
16150,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"was often crossed by little rivulets, and we were entertained with small"
16151,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"streams trickling from the rocks, which, after heavy rains, must be"
16152,VII.--TO THE SAME.,tremendous torrents.
16153,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16154,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"About noon we came to a small glen, so they call a valley, which,"
16155,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"compared with other places, appeared rich and fertile; here our guides"
16156,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"desired us to stop, that the horses might graze, for the journey was"
16157,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"very laborious, and no more grass would be found. We made no difficulty"
16158,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of compliance, and I sat down to take notes on a green bank, with a"
16159,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"small stream running at my feet, in the midst of savage solitude, with"
16160,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"mountains before me, and, on either hand, covered with heath. I looked"
16161,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"around me, and wondered, that I was not more affected, but the mind is"
16162,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"not at all times equally ready to be put in motion; if my mistress, and"
16163,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"master, and Queeney had been there, we should have produced some"
16164,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"reflections among us, either poetical or philosophical; for though"
16165,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"""solitude be the nurse of woe,"" conversation is often the parent of"
16166,VII.--TO THE SAME.,remarks and discoveries.
16167,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16168,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"In about an hour we remounted, and pursued our journey. The lake, by"
16169,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which we had travelled for some time, ended in a river, which we passed"
16170,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"by a bridge, and came to another glen, with a collection of huts, called"
16171,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Auknashealds; the huts were, generally, built of clods of earth, held"
16172,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"together by the intertexture of vegetable fibres, of which earth there"
16173,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"are great levels in Scotland, which they call mosses. Moss in Scotland"
16174,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"is bog in Ireland, and moss-trooper is bog-trotter; there was, however,"
16175,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"one hut built of loose stones, piled up, with great thickness, into a"
16176,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"strong, though not solid wall. From this house we obtained some great"
16177,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"pails of milk, and having brought bread with us, we were liberally"
16178,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"regaled. The inhabitants, a very coarse tribe, ignorant of any language"
16179,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"but Erse, gathered so fast about us, that, if we had not had highlanders"
16180,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with us, they might have caused more alarm than pleasure; they are"
16181,VII.--TO THE SAME.,called the clan of Macrae.
16182,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16183,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"We had been told, that nothing gratified the highlanders so much as"
16184,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"snuff and tobacco, and had, accordingly, stored ourselves with both at"
16185,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Fort Augustus. Boswell opened his treasure, and gave them each a piece"
16186,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of tobacco roll. We had more bread than we could eat for the present,"
16187,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and were more liberal than provident. Boswell cut it in slices, and gave"
16188,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"them an opportunity of tasting wheaten bread, for the first time. I then"
16189,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"got some half-pence for a shilling, and made up the deficiencies of"
16190,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Boswell's distribution, who had given some money among the children. We"
16191,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"then directed, that the mistress of the stone-house should be asked,"
16192,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"what we must pay her. She, who, perhaps, had never before sold any thing"
16193,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"but cattle, knew not, I believe, well what to ask, and referred herself"
16194,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"to us: we obliged her to make some demand, and one of the Highlanders"
16195,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"settled the account with her at a shilling. One of the men advised her,"
16196,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with the cunning that clowns never can be without, to ask more; but she"
16197,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"said that a shilling was enough. We gave her half-a-crown, and she"
16198,VII.--TO THE SAME.,offered part of it again. The Macraes were so well pleased with our
16199,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"behaviour, that they declared it the best day they had seen, since the"
16200,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"time of the old laird of Macleod, who, I suppose, like us, stopped in"
16201,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"their valley, as he was travelling to Skie."
16202,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16203,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"We were mentioning this view of the highlander's life at Macdonald's,"
16204,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and mentioning the Macraes, with some degree of pity, when a highland"
16205,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"lady informed us, that we might spare our tenderness, for she doubted"
16206,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"not but the woman, who supplied us with milk, was mistress of thirteen"
16207,VII.--TO THE SAME.,or fourteen milch cows.
16208,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16209,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I cannot forbear to interrupt my narrative. Boswell, with some of his"
16210,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"troublesome kindness, has informed this family, and reminded me, that"
16211,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the 18th of September is my birthday. The return of my birthday, if I"
16212,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"remember it, fills me with thoughts which it seems to be the general"
16213,VII.--TO THE SAME.,care of humanity to escape. I can now look back upon threescore and four
16214,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"years, in which little has been done, and little has been enjoyed; a"
16215,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"life, diversified by misery, spent part in the sluggishness of penury,"
16216,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and part under the violence of pain, in gloomy discontent, or"
16217,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"importunate distress. But, perhaps, I am better than I should have been,"
16218,VII.--TO THE SAME.,if I had been less afflicted. With this I will try to be content.
16219,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16220,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"In proportion as there is less pleasure in retrospective considerations,"
16221,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the mind is more disposed to wander forward into futurity; but, at"
16222,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sixty-four, what promises, however liberal, of imaginary good can"
16223,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"futurity venture to make? yet something will be always promised, and"
16224,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"some promises will be always credited. I am hoping, and I am praying,"
16225,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"that I may live better in the time to come, whether long or short, than"
16226,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I have yet lived, and, in the solace of that hope, endeavour to repose."
16227,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Dear Queeney's day is next: I hope she, at sixty-four, will have less to"
16228,VII.--TO THE SAME.,regret.
16229,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16230,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I will now complain no more, but tell my mistress of my travels."
16231,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16232,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"After we left the Macraes, we travelled on through a country like that"
16233,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which we passed in the morning. The highlands are very uniform, for"
16234,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"there is little variety in universal barrenness; the rocks, however, are"
16235,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"not all naked, for some have grass on their sides, and birches and"
16236,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"alders on their tops, and in the valleys are often broad and clear"
16237,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"streams, which have little depth, and commonly run very quick; the"
16238,VII.--TO THE SAME.,channels are made by the violence of the wintry floods; the quickness of
16239,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the stream is in proportion to the declivity of the descent, and the"
16240,VII.--TO THE SAME.,breadth of the channel makes the water shallow in a dry season.
16241,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16242,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"There are red deer and roe bucks in the mountains, but we found only"
16243,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"goats in the road, and had very little entertainment, as we travelled,"
16244,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"either for the eye or ear. There are, I fancy, no singing birds in the"
16245,VII.--TO THE SAME.,highlands.
16246,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16247,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Towards night we came to a very formidable hill, called Rattiken, which"
16248,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"we climbed with more difficulty than we had yet experienced, and, at"
16249,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"last, came to Glanelg, a place on the seaside, opposite to Skie. We"
16250,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"were, by this time, weary and disgusted, nor was our humour much mended"
16251,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"by our inn, which, though it was built of lime and slate, the"
16252,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"highlander's description of a house, which he thinks magnificent, had"
16253,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"neither wine, bread, eggs, nor any thing that we could eat or drink."
16254,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"When we were taken up stairs, a dirty fellow bounced out of the bed,"
16255,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"where one of us was to lie. Boswell blustered, but nothing could be got."
16256,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"At last, a gentleman in the neighbourhood, who heard of our arrival,"
16257,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sent us rum and white sugar. Boswell was now provided for, in part, and"
16258,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the landlord prepared some mutton chops, which we could not eat, and"
16259,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"killed two hens, of which Boswell made his servant broil a limb; with"
16260,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"what effect I know not. We had a lemon and a piece of bread, which"
16261,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"supplied me with my supper. When the repast was ended, we began to"
16262,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"deliberate upon bed: Mrs. Boswell had warned us, that we should _catch"
16263,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"something_, and had given us _sheets_, for our _security_, for--and--,"
16264,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"she said, came back from Skie, so scratching themselves. I thought"
16265,VII.--TO THE SAME.,sheets a slender defence against the confederacy with which we were
16266,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"threatened, and, by this time, our Highlanders had found a place, where"
16267,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"they could get some hay: I ordered hay to be laid thick upon the bed,"
16268,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and slept upon it in my great coat: Boswell laid sheets upon his bed,"
16269,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and reposed in linen, like a gentleman. The horses were turned out to"
16270,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"grass, with a man to watch them. The hill Rattiken, and the inn at"
16271,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Glanelg, were the only things of which we, or travellers yet more"
16272,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"delicate, could find any pretensions to complain."
16273,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16274,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Sept. 2nd. I rose, rustling from the hay, and went to tea, which I"
16275,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"forget, whether we found or brought. We saw the isle of Skie before us,"
16276,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"darkening the horizon with its rocky coast. A boat was procured, and we"
16277,VII.--TO THE SAME.,lanched into one of the straits of the Atlantick ocean. We had a passage
16278,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of about twelve miles to the point where--resided, having come from his"
16279,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"seat in the middle of the island, to a small house on the shore, as we"
16280,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"believe, that he might, with less reproach, entertain us meanly. If he"
16281,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"aspired to meanness, his retrograde ambition was completely gratified,"
16282,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"but he did not succeed equally in escaping reproach. He had no cook,"
16283,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"nor, I suppose, much provision, nor had the lady the common decencies of"
16284,VII.--TO THE SAME.,her tea-table; we picked up our sugar with our fingers. Boswell was very
16285,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"angry, and reproached him with his improper parsimony; I did not much"
16286,VII.--TO THE SAME.,reflect upon the conduct of a man with whom I was not likely to converse
16287,VII.--TO THE SAME.,as long at any other time.
16288,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16289,VII.--TO THE SAME.,You will now expect that I should give you some account of the isle of
16290,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Skie, of which, though I have been twelve days upon it, I have little to"
16291,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"say. It is an island, perhaps, fifty miles long, so much indented by"
16292,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"inlets of the sea, that there is no part of it removed from the water"
16293,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"more than six miles. No part, that I have seen, is plain; you are always"
16294,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"climbing or descending, and every step is upon rock or mire. A walk upon"
16295,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"ploughed ground in England is a dance upon carpets, compared to the"
16296,VII.--TO THE SAME.,toilsome drudgery of wandering in Skie. There is neither town nor
16297,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"village in the island, nor have I seen any house but Macleod's, that is"
16298,VII.--TO THE SAME.,not much below your habitation at Brighthelmstone. In the mountains
16299,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"there are stags and roe bucks, but no hares, and few rabbits; nor have I"
16300,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"seen any thing that interested me, as a zoologist, except an otter,"
16301,VII.--TO THE SAME.,bigger than I thought an otter could have been.
16302,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16303,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"You are, perhaps, imagining that I am withdrawing from the gay and the"
16304,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"busy world, into regions of peace and pastoral felicity, and am enjoying"
16305,VII.--TO THE SAME.,the relicks of the golden age; that I am surveying nature's magnificence
16306,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"from a mountain, or remarking her minuter beauties on the flowery bank"
16307,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of a winding rivulet; that I am invigorating myself in the sunshine, or"
16308,VII.--TO THE SAME.,delighting my imagination with being hidden from the invasion of human
16309,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"evils and human passions, in the darkness of a thicket; that I am busy"
16310,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"in gathering shells and pebbles on the shore, or contemplative on a"
16311,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"rock, from which I look upon the water, and consider how many waves are"
16312,VII.--TO THE SAME.,rolling between me and Streatham.
16313,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16314,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"The use of travelling is to regulate imagination by reality, and,"
16315,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"instead of thinking how things may be, to see them as they are. Here are"
16316,VII.--TO THE SAME.,mountains which I should once have climbed; but to climb steeps is now
16317,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"very laborious, and to descend them, dangerous; and I am now content"
16318,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with knowing, that, by scrambling up a rock, I shall only see other"
16319,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"rocks, and a wider circuit of barren desolation. Of streams, we have"
16320,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"here a sufficient number; but they murmur not upon pebbles, but upon"
16321,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"rocks. Of flowers, if Chloris herself were here, I could present her"
16322,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"only with the bloom of heath. Of lawns and thickets, he must read that"
16323,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"would know them, for here is little sun, and no shade. On the sea I look"
16324,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"from my window, but am not much tempted to the shore; for since I came"
16325,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"to this island, almost every breath of air has been a storm, and, what"
16326,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"is worse, a storm with all its severity, but without its magnificence,"
16327,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"for the sea is here so broken into channels, that there is not a"
16328,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sufficient volume of water either for lofty surges, or a loud roar."
16329,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16330,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"On Sept. 6th, we left--to visit Raarsa, the island which I have already"
16331,VII.--TO THE SAME.,mentioned. We were to cross part of Skie on horseback; a mode of
16332,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"travelling very uncomfortable, for the road is so narrow, where any road"
16333,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"can be found, that only one can go, and so craggy, that the attention"
16334,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"can never be remitted; it allows, therefore, neither the gaiety of"
16335,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"conversation, nor the laxity of solitude; nor has it, in itself, the"
16336,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"amusement of much variety, as it affords only all the possible"
16337,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"transpositions of bog, rock, and rivulet. Twelve miles, by computation,"
16338,VII.--TO THE SAME.,make a reasonable journey for a day.
16339,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16340,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"At night we came to a tenant's house, of the first rank of tenants,"
16341,VII.--TO THE SAME.,where we were entertained better than at the landlord's. There were
16342,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"books, both English and Latin. Company gathered about us, and we heard"
16343,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"some talk of the second sight, and some talk of the events of forty-five;"
16344,VII.--TO THE SAME.,a year which will not soon be forgotten among the islanders. The
16345,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"next day we were confined by a storm. The company, I think, increased,"
16346,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and our entertainment was not only hospitable, but elegant. At night, a"
16347,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"minister's sister, in very fine brocade, sung Erse songs; I wished to"
16348,VII.--TO THE SAME.,know the meaning; but the highlanders are not much used to scholastick
16349,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"questions, and no translations could be obtained."
16350,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16351,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Next day, Sept. 8th, the weather allowed us to depart; a good boat was"
16352,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"provided us, and we went to Raarsa, under the conduct of Mr. Malcolm"
16353,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Macleod, a gentleman who conducted prince Charles through the mountains"
16354,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"in his distresses. The prince, he says, was more active than himself;"
16355,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"they were, at least, one night without any shelter."
16356,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16357,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"The wind blew enough to give the boat a kind of dancing agitation, and,"
16358,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"in about three or four hours, we arrived at Raarsa, where we were met by"
16359,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the laird, and his friends, upon the shore. Raarsa, for such is his"
16360,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"title, is master of two islands; upon the smaller of which, called Rona,"
16361,VII.--TO THE SAME.,he has only flocks and herds. Rona gives title to his eldest son. The
16362,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"money which he raises annually by rent from all his dominions, which"
16363,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"contain, at least, fifty thousand acres, is not believed to exceed two"
16364,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"hundred and fifty pounds; but, as he keeps a large farm in his own"
16365,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"hands, he sells, every year, great numbers of cattle, which add to his"
16366,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"revenue, and his table is furnished from the farm and from the sea, with"
16367,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"very little expense, except for those things this country does not"
16368,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"produce, and of those he is very liberal. The wine circulates"
16369,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"vigorously; and the tea, chocolate, and coffee, however they are got,"
16370,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"are always at hand. I am, &c."
16371,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16372,VII.--TO THE SAME.,We are this morning trying to get out of Skie.
16373,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16374,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16375,VII.--TO THE SAME.,XXIII.--To MRS. THRALE.
16376,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16377,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Skie, Sept. 24, 1773."
16378,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16379,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"DEAR MADAM,--I am still in Skie. Do you remember the song,"
16380,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16381,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"""Every island is a prison,"
16382,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Strongly guarded by the sea."""
16383,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16384,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"We have, at one time, no boat, and, at another, may have too much wind;"
16385,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"but, of our reception here, we have no reason to complain. We are now"
16386,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with colonel Macleod, in a more pleasant place than I thought Skie could"
16387,VII.--TO THE SAME.,afford. Now to the narrative.
16388,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16389,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"We were received at Raarsa on the seaside, and after clambering, with"
16390,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"some difficulty, over the rocks, a labour which the traveller, wherever"
16391,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"he reposes himself on land, must, in these islands, be contented to"
16392,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"endure; we were introduced into the house, which one of the company"
16393,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"called the court of Raarsa, with politeness, which not the court of"
16394,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Versailles could have thought defective. The house is not large, though"
16395,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"we were told, in our passage, that it had eleven fine rooms, nor"
16396,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"magnificently furnished; but our utensils were, most commonly, silver."
16397,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"We went up into a dining-room, about as large as your blue room, where"
16398,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"we had something given us to eat, and tea and coffee."
16399,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16400,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Raarsa himself is a man of no inelegant appearance, and of manners"
16401,VII.--TO THE SAME.,uncommonly refined. Lady Raarsa makes no very sublime appearance for a
16402,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sovereign, but is a good housewife, and a very prudent and diligent"
16403,VII.--TO THE SAME.,conductress of her family. Miss Flora Macleod is a celebrated beauty;
16404,VII.--TO THE SAME.,has been admired at Edinburgh; dresses her head very high; and has
16405,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"manners so lady-like, that I wish her head-dress was lower. The rest of"
16406,VII.--TO THE SAME.,the nine girls are all pretty; the youngest is between Queeney and Lucy.
16407,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"The youngest boy, of four years old, runs barefoot, and wandered with us"
16408,VII.--TO THE SAME.,over the rocks to see a mill: I believe he would walk on that rough
16409,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"ground, without shoes, ten miles in a day."
16410,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16411,VII.--TO THE SAME.,The laird of Raarsa has sometimes disputed the chieftainry of the clan
16412,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with Macleod of Skie, but, being much inferiour in extent of"
16413,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"possessions, has, I suppose, been forced to desist. Raarsa, and its"
16414,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"provinces, have descended to its present possessour, through a"
16415,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"succession of four hundred years, without any increase or diminution. It"
16416,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"was, indeed, lately in danger of forfeiture, but the old laird joined"
16417,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"some prudence with his zeal, and when prince Charles landed in Scotland,"
16418,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"made over his estate to this son, the present laird, and led one hundred"
16419,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"men of Raarsa into the field, with officers of his own family. Eighty-six"
16420,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"only came back after the last battle. The prince was hidden, in his"
16421,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"distress, two nights at Raarsa, and the king's troops burnt the whole"
16422,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"country, and killed some of the cattle."
16423,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16424,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"You may guess at the opinions that prevail in this country; they are,"
16425,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"however, content with fighting for their king; they do not drink for"
16426,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"him. We had no foolish healths. At night, unexpectedly to us, who were"
16427,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"strangers, the carpet was taken up; the fiddler of the family came up,"
16428,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and a very vigorous and general dance was begun. As I told you, we were"
16429,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"two and thirty at supper; there were full as many dancers; for, though"
16430,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"all who supped did not dance, some danced of the young people who did"
16431,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"not sup. Raarsa himself danced with his children, and old Malcolm, in"
16432,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"his fillibeg, was as nimble, as when he led the prince over the"
16433,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"mountains. When they had danced themselves weary, two tables were"
16434,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"spread, and, I suppose, at least twenty dishes were upon them. In this"
16435,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"country, some preparations of milk are always served up at supper, and"
16436,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sometimes, in the place of tarts, at dinner. The table was not coarsely"
16437,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"heaped, but, at once, plentiful and elegant. They do not pretend to make"
16438,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"a loaf; there are only cakes, commonly of oats or barley, but they made"
16439,VII.--TO THE SAME.,me very nice cakes of wheat flour. I always sat at the left hand of lady
16440,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Raarsa; and young Macleod of Skie, the chieftain of the clan, sat on the"
16441,VII.--TO THE SAME.,right.
16442,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16443,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"After supper, a young lady, who was visiting, sung Erse songs, in which"
16444,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"lady Raarsa joined, prettily enough, but not gracefully; the young"
16445,VII.--TO THE SAME.,ladies sustained the chorus better. They are very little used to be
16446,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"asked questions, and not well prepared with answers. When one of the"
16447,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"songs was over, I asked the princess, that sat next to me, ""What is that"
16448,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"about?"" I question if she conceived that I did not understand it. ""For"
16449,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the entertainment of the company,"" said she. ""But, madam, what is the"
16450,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"meaning of it?"" ""It is a love song."" This was all the intelligence that"
16451,VII.--TO THE SAME.,I could obtain; nor have I been able to procure the translation of a
16452,VII.--TO THE SAME.,single line of Erse.
16453,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16454,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"At twelve it was bed-time. I had a chamber to myself, which, in eleven"
16455,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"rooms to forty people, was more than my share. How the company and the"
16456,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"family were distributed, is not easy to tell. Macleod, the chieftain,"
16457,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and Boswell, and I, had all single chambers, on the first floor. There"
16458,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"remained eight rooms only, for, at least, seven and thirty lodgers. I"
16459,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"suppose they put up temporary beds in the dining-room, where they stowed"
16460,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"all the young ladies. There was a room above stairs with six beds, in"
16461,VII.--TO THE SAME.,which they put ten men. The rest in my next.
16462,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16463,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16464,VII.--TO THE SAME.,XXIV.--To MRS. THRALE.
16465,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16466,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Ostich in Skie, Sept. 30, 1773."
16467,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16468,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"DEAREST MADAM,--I am still confined in Skie. We were unskilful"
16469,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"travellers, and imagined that the sea was an open road, which we could"
16470,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"pass at pleasure; but we have now learned, with some pain, that we may"
16471,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"still wait, for a long time, the caprices of the equinoctial winds, and"
16472,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sit reading or writing, as I now do, while the tempest is rolling the"
16473,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sea, or roaring in the mountains. I am now no longer pleased with the"
16474,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"delay; you can hear from me but seldom, and I cannot at all hear from"
16475,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"you. It comes into my mind, that some evil may happen, or that I might"
16476,VII.--TO THE SAME.,be of use while I am away. But these thoughts are vain; the wind is
16477,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"violent and adverse, and our boat cannot yet come. I must content myself"
16478,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with writing to you, and hoping that you will sometime receive my"
16479,VII.--TO THE SAME.,letter. Now to my narrative.
16480,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16481,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Sept. 9th. Having passed the night as is usual, I rose, and found the"
16482,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"dining-room full of company; we feasted and talked, and when the evening"
16483,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"came it brought musick and dancing. Young Macleod, the great proprietor"
16484,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of Skie, and head of his clan, was very distinguishable; a young man of"
16485,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"nineteen, bred awhile at St. Andrew's, and afterwards at Oxford, a pupil"
16486,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of G. Strahan. He is a young man of a mind, as much advanced as I have"
16487,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"ever known; very elegant of manners, and very graceful in his person. He"
16488,VII.--TO THE SAME.,has the full spirit of a feudal chief; and I was very ready to accept
16489,VII.--TO THE SAME.,his invitation to Dunvegan. All Raarsa's children are beautiful. The
16490,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"ladies, all, except the eldest, are in the morning dressed in their"
16491,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"hair. The true highlander never wears more than a riband on her head,"
16492,VII.--TO THE SAME.,till she is married.
16493,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16494,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"On the third day Boswell went out, with old Malcolm, to see a ruined"
16495,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"castle, which he found less entire than was promised, but he saw the"
16496,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"country. I did not go, for the castle was, perhaps, ten miles off, and"
16497,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"there is no riding at Raarsa, the whole island being rock or mountain,"
16498,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"from which the cattle often fall, and are destroyed. It is very barren,"
16499,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and maintains, as near as I could collect, about seven hundred"
16500,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"inhabitants, perhaps ten to a square mile. In these countries you are"
16501,VII.--TO THE SAME.,not to suppose that you shall find villages or inclosures. The traveller
16502,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"wanders through a naked desert, gratified sometimes, but rarely, with"
16503,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the sight of cows, and now and then finds a heap of loose stones and"
16504,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"turf, in a cavity between rocks, where a being, born with all those"
16505,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"powers which education expands, and all those sensations which culture"
16506,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"refines, is condemned to shelter itself from the wind and rain."
16507,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Philosophers there are, who try to make themselves believe, that this"
16508,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"life is happy; but they believe it only while they are saying it, and"
16509,VII.--TO THE SAME.,never yet produced conviction in a single mind; he whom want of words or
16510,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"images sunk into silence still thought, as he thought before, that"
16511,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"privation of pleasure can never please, and that content is not to be"
16512,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"much envied, when it has no other principle than ignorance of good."
16513,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16514,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"This gloomy tranquillity, which some may call fortitude, and others,"
16515,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"wisdom, was, I believe, for a long time, to be very frequently found in"
16516,VII.--TO THE SAME.,these dens of poverty; every man was content to live like his
16517,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"neighbours, and, never wandering from home, saw no mode of life"
16518,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"preferable to his own, except at the house of the laird, or the laird's"
16519,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"nearest relations, whom he considered as a superiour order of beings, to"
16520,VII.--TO THE SAME.,whose luxuries or honours he had no pretensions. But the end of this
16521,VII.--TO THE SAME.,reverence and submission seems now approaching; the highlanders have
16522,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"learned, that there are countries less bleak and barren than their own,"
16523,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"where, instead of working for the laird, every man will till his own"
16524,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"ground, and eat the produce of his own labour. Great numbers have been"
16525,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"induced, by this discovery, to go, every year, for some time past, to"
16526,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"America. Macdonald and Macleod, of Skie, have lost many tenants and many"
16527,VII.--TO THE SAME.,labourers; but Raarsa has not yet been forsaken by a single inhabitant.
16528,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16529,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Rona is yet more rocky and barren than Raarsa, and, though it contains,"
16530,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"perhaps, four thousand acres, is possessed only by a herd of cattle and"
16531,VII.--TO THE SAME.,the keepers.
16532,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16533,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I find myself not very able to walk upon the mountains, but one day I"
16534,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"went out to see the walls, yet standing, of an ancient chapel. In almost"
16535,VII.--TO THE SAME.,every island the superstitious votaries of the Romish church erected
16536,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"places of worship, in which the drones of convents, or cathedrals,"
16537,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"performed the holy offices; but, by the active zeal of protestant"
16538,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"devotion, almost all of them have sunk into ruin. The chapel at Raarsa"
16539,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"is now only considered as the burying-place of the family, and, I"
16540,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"suppose, of the whole island."
16541,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16542,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"We would now have gone away, and left room for others to enjoy the"
16543,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"pleasures of this little court; but the wind detained us till the 12th,"
16544,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"when, though it was Sunday, we thought it proper to snatch the"
16545,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"opportunity of a calm day. Raarsa accompanied us in his six-oared boat,"
16546,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which, he said, was his coach and six. It is, indeed, the vehicle in"
16547,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which the ladies take the air, and pay their visits, but they have taken"
16548,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"very little care for accommodations. There is no way, in or out of the"
16549,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"boat, for a woman, but by being carried; and in the boat thus dignified"
16550,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with a pompous name, there is no seat, but an occasional bundle of"
16551,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"straw. Thus we left Raarsa; the seat of plenty, civility, and"
16552,VII.--TO THE SAME.,cheerfulness.
16553,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16554,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"We dined at a publick house at Port Re; so called, because one of the"
16555,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Scottish kings landed there, in a progress through the western isles."
16556,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Raarsa paid the reckoning privately. We then got on horseback, and, by a"
16557,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"short, but very tedious journey, came to Kingsburgh, at which the same"
16558,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"king lodged, after he landed. Here I had the honour of saluting the"
16559,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"far-famed Miss Flora Macdonald, who conducted the prince, dressed as her"
16560,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"maid, through the English forces, from the island of Lewes; and, when"
16561,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"she came to Skie, dined with the English officers, and left her maid"
16562,VII.--TO THE SAME.,below. She must then have been a very young lady; she is now not old; of
16563,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"a pleasing person, and elegant behaviour. She told me, that she thought"
16564,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"herself honoured by my visit; and, I am sure, that whatever regard she"
16565,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"bestowed on me was liberally repaid. ""If thou likest her opinions, thou"
16566,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"wilt praise her virtue."" She was carried to London, but dismissed"
16567,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"without a trial, and came down with Malcolm Macleod, against whom"
16568,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sufficient evidence could not be procured. She and her husband are poor,"
16569,VII.--TO THE SAME.,and are going to try their fortune in America:
16570,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16571,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"""Sic rerum volvitur orbis."""
16572,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16573,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"At Kingsburgh we were very liberally feasted, and I slept in the bed in"
16574,VII.--TO THE SAME.,which the prince reposed in his distress; the sheets which he used were
16575,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"never put to any meaner offices, but were wrapped up by the lady of the"
16576,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"house, and at last, according to her desire, were laid round her in her"
16577,VII.--TO THE SAME.,grave. These are not whigs.
16578,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16579,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"On the 13th, travelling partly on horseback, where we could not row, and"
16580,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"partly on foot, where we could not ride, we came to Dunvegan, which I"
16581,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"have described already. Here, though poor Macleod had been left by his"
16582,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"grandfather overwhelmed with debts, we had another exhibition of feudal"
16583,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"hospitality. There were two stags in the house, and venison came to the"
16584,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"table every day in its various forms. Macleod, besides his estate in"
16585,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Skie, larger, I suppose, than some English counties, is proprietor of"
16586,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"nine inhabited isles; and, of his islands uninhabited, I doubt if he"
16587,VII.--TO THE SAME.,very exactly knows the number. I told him that he was a mighty monarch.
16588,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Such dominions fill an Englishman with envious wonder; but, when he"
16589,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"surveys the naked mountains, and treads the quaking moor, and wanders"
16590,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"over the wild regions of gloomy barrenness, his wonder may continue, but"
16591,VII.--TO THE SAME.,his envy ceases. The unprofitableness of these vast domains can be
16592,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"conceived only by the means of positive instances. The heir of Col, an"
16593,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"island not far distant, has lately told me, how wealthy he should be, if"
16594,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"he could let Rum, another of his islands, for twopence halfpenny an"
16595,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"acre; and Macleod has an estate, which the surveyor reports to contain"
16596,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"eighty thousand acres, rented at six hundred pounds a year."
16597,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16598,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"While we were at Dunvegan, the wind was high, and the rain violent, so"
16599,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"that we were not able to put forth a boat to fish in the sea, or to"
16600,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"visit the adjacent islands, which may be seen from the house; but we"
16601,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"filled up the time, as we could, sometimes by talk, sometimes by"
16602,VII.--TO THE SAME.,reading. I have never wanted books in the isle of Skie.
16603,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16604,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"We were invited one day by the laird and lady of Muck, one of the"
16605,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"western islands, two miles long, and three quarters of a mile high. He"
16606,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"has half his island in his own culture, and upon the other half live one"
16607,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"hundred and fifty dependants, who not only live upon the product, but"
16608,VII.--TO THE SAME.,export corn sufficient for the payment of their rent.
16609,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16610,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Lady Macleod has a son and four daughters; they have lived long in
16611,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"England, and have the language and manners of English ladies. We lived"
16612,VII.--TO THE SAME.,with them very easily. The hospitality of this remote region is like
16613,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"that of the golden age. We have found ourselves treated, at every house,"
16614,VII.--TO THE SAME.,as if we came to confer a benefit.
16615,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16616,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"We were eight days at Dunvegan, but we took the first opportunity which"
16617,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the weather afforded, after the first days, of going away, and, on the"
16618,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"21st, went to Ulinish, where we were well entertained, and wandered a"
16619,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"little after curiosities. In the afternoon, an interval of calm sunshine"
16620,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"courted us out, to see a cave on the shore, famous for its echo. When we"
16621,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"went into the boat, one of our companions was asked, in Erse, by the"
16622,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"boatmen, who they were, that came with him. He gave us characters, I"
16623,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"suppose, to our advantage, and was asked, in the spirit of the"
16624,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"highlands, whether I could recite a long series of ancestors. The"
16625,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"boatmen said, as I perceived afterwards, that they heard the cry of an"
16626,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"English ghost. This, Boswell says, disturbed him. We came to the cave,"
16627,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and, clambering up the rocks, came to an arch, open at one end, one"
16628,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"hundred and eighty feet long, thirty broad, in the broadest part, and"
16629,VII.--TO THE SAME.,about thirty high. There was no echo: such is the fidelity of report;
16630,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"but I saw, what I had never seen before, muscles and whilks, in their"
16631,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"natural state. There was another arch in the rock, open at both ends."
16632,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16633,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"September 23rd. We removed to Talisker, a house occupied by Mr. Macleod,"
16634,VII.--TO THE SAME.,a lieutenant colonel in the Dutch service. Talisker has been long in the
16635,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"possession of gentlemen, and, therefore, has a garden well cultivated,"
16636,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and, what is here very rare, is shaded by trees; a place where the"
16637,VII.--TO THE SAME.,imagination is more amused cannot easily be found. The mountains about
16638,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"it are of great height, with waterfalls succeeding one another so fast,"
16639,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"that as one ceases to be heard, another begins. Between the mountains"
16640,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"there is a small valley, extending to the sea, which is not far off,"
16641,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"beating upon a coast, very difficult of access."
16642,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16643,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Two nights before our arrival, two boats were driven upon this coast by"
16644,VII.--TO THE SAME.,the tempest; one of them had a pilot that knew the passage; the second
16645,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"followed, but a third missed the true course, and was driven forward,"
16646,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with great danger of being forced into the vast ocean, but, however,"
16647,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"gained, at last, some other island. The crews crept to Talisker, almost"
16648,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"lifeless with wet, cold, fatigue, and terrour, but the lady took care of"
16649,VII.--TO THE SAME.,them. She is a woman of more than common qualifications; having
16650,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"travelled with her husband, she speaks four languages."
16651,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16652,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"You find, that all the islanders, even in these recesses of life, are"
16653,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"not barbarous. One of the ministers, who has adhered to us almost all"
16654,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the time, is an excellent scholar. We have now with us the young laird"
16655,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of Col, who is heir, perhaps, to two hundred square miles of land. He"
16656,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"has first studied at Aberdeen, and afterwards gone to Hertfordshire, to"
16657,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"learn agriculture, being much impressed with desire of improvement; he,"
16658,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"likewise, has the notions of a chief, and keeps a piper. At Macleod's"
16659,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the bagpipe always played, while we were dining."
16660,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16661,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Col has undertaken, by permission of the waves and wind, to carry us"
16662,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"about several of the islands, with which he is acquainted enough to show"
16663,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"us whatever curious is given by nature, or left by antiquity; but we"
16664,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"grew afraid of deviating from our way home, lest we should be shut up"
16665,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"for months upon some little protuberance of rock, that just appears"
16666,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"above the sea, and, perhaps, is scarcely marked upon a map."
16667,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16668,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"You remember the doge of Genoa, who being asked, what struck him most at"
16669,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the French court, answered, ""myself."" I cannot think many things here"
16670,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"more likely to affect the fancy, than to see Johnson ending his"
16671,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sixty-fourth year in the wilderness of the Hebrides. But now I am here, it"
16672,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"will gratify me very little to return without seeing, or doing my best"
16673,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"to see, what those places afford. I have a desire to instruct myself in"
16674,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the whole system of pastoral life, but I know not whether I shall be"
16675,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"able to perfect the idea. However, I have many pictures in my mind,"
16676,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which I could not have had without this journey, and should have passed"
16677,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"it with great pleasure, had you, and master, and Queeney, been in the"
16678,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"party. We should have excited the attention, and enlarged the"
16679,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"observation of each other, and obtained many pleasing topicks of future"
16680,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"conversation. As it is, I travel with my mind too much at home, and,"
16681,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"perhaps, miss many things worthy of observation, or pass them with"
16682,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"transient notice; so that the images, for want of that reimpression"
16683,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which discussion and comparison produce, easily fade away; but I keep a"
16684,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"book of remarks, and Boswell writes a regular journal of our travels,"
16685,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which, I think, contains as much of what I say and do, as of all other"
16686,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"occurrences together; ""for such a faithful chronicler as Griffith."""
16687,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16688,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I hope, dearest madam, you are equally careful to reposit proper"
16689,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"memorials of all that happens to you and your family, and then, when we"
16690,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"meet, we shall tell our stories. I wish you had gone this summer, in"
16691,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"your usual splendour, to Brighthelmstone."
16692,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16693,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Mr. Thrale probably wonders, how I live all this time without sending to"
16694,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"him for money. Travelling in Scotland is dear enough, dearer, in"
16695,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"proportion to what the country affords, than in England, but residence"
16696,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"in the isles is unexpensive. Company is, I think, considered as a supply"
16697,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of pleasure, and a relief of that tediousness of life which is felt in"
16698,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"every place, elegant or rude. Of wine and punch they are very liberal,"
16699,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"for they get them cheap; but as there is no custom-house on the island,"
16700,VII.--TO THE SAME.,they can hardly be considered as smugglers. Their punch is made without
16701,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"lemons, or any substitute."
16702,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16703,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Their tables are very plentiful; but a very nice man would not be
16704,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"pampered. As they have no meat but as they kill it, they are obliged to"
16705,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"live, while it lasts, upon the same flesh. They kill a sheep, and set"
16706,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"mutton boiled and roast on the table together. They have fish, both of"
16707,VII.--TO THE SAME.,the sea and of the brooks; but they can hardly conceive that it requires
16708,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"any sauce. To sauce, in general, they are strangers: now and then butter"
16709,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"is melted, but I dare not always take, lest I should offend by disliking"
16710,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"it. Barley broth is a constant dish, and is made well in every house. A"
16711,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"stranger, if he is prudent, will secure his share, for it is not certain"
16712,VII.--TO THE SAME.,that he will be able to eat any thing else.
16713,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16714,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Their meat, being often newly killed, is very tough, and, as nothing is"
16715,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sufficiently subdued by the fire, is not easily to be eaten. Carving is"
16716,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"here a very laborious employment, for the knives are never whetted."
16717,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Table knives are not of long subsistence in the highlands: every man,"
16718,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"while arms were a regular part of dress, had his knife and fork"
16719,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"appendant to his dirk. Knives they now lay upon the table, but the"
16720,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"handles are apt to show that they have been in other hands, and the"
16721,VII.--TO THE SAME.,blades have neither brightness nor edge.
16722,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16723,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Of silver, there is no want, and it will last long, for it is never"
16724,VII.--TO THE SAME.,cleaned. They are a nation just rising from barbarity: long contented
16725,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with necessaries, now somewhat studious of convenience, but not yet"
16726,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"arrived at delicate discriminations. Their linen is, however, both clean"
16727,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and fine. Bread, such as we mean by that name, I have never seen in the"
16728,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"isle of Skie. They have ovens, for they bake their pies; but they never"
16729,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"ferment their meal, nor mould a loaf. Cakes of oats and barley are"
16730,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"brought to the table, but I believe wheat is reserved for strangers."
16731,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"They are commonly too hard for me, and, therefore, I take potatoes to my"
16732,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"meat, and am sure to find them on almost every table."
16733,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16734,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"They retain so much of the pastoral life, that some preparation of milk"
16735,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"is commonly one of the dishes, both at dinner and supper. Tea is always"
16736,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"drunk at the usual times; but, in the morning, the table is polluted"
16737,VII.--TO THE SAME.,with a plate of slices of strong cheese. This is peculiar to the
16738,VII.--TO THE SAME.,highlands; at Edinburgh there are always honey and sweetmeats on the
16739,VII.--TO THE SAME.,morning tea-table.
16740,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16741,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Strong liquors they seem to love. Every man, perhaps, woman, begins the"
16742,VII.--TO THE SAME.,day with a dram; and the punch is made both at dinner and supper.
16743,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16744,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"They have neither wood nor coal for fuel, but burn peat or turf in their"
16745,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"chimneys. It is dug out of the moors or mosses, and makes a strong and"
16746,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"lasting fire, not always very sweet, and somewhat apt to smoke the pot."
16747,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16748,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"The houses of inferiour gentlemen are very small, and every room serves"
16749,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"many purposes. In the bed-rooms, perhaps, are laid up stores of"
16750,VII.--TO THE SAME.,different kinds; and the parlour of the day is a bed-room at night. In
16751,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the room which I inhabited last, about fourteen feet square, there were"
16752,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"three chests of drawers, a long chest for larger clothes, two"
16753,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"closet-cupboards, and the bed. Their rooms are commonly dirty, of which"
16754,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"they seem to have little sensibility, and if they had more, clean floors"
16755,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"would be difficultly kept, where the first step from the door is into"
16756,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the dirt. They are very much inclined to carpets, and seldom fail to lay"
16757,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"down something under their feet, better or worse, as they happen to be"
16758,VII.--TO THE SAME.,furnished.
16759,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16760,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"The highland dress, being forbidden by law, is very little used;"
16761,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sometimes it may be seen, but the English traveller is struck with"
16762,VII.--TO THE SAME.,nothing so much as the _nudité des pieds_ of the common people.
16763,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16764,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Skie is the greatest island, or the greatest but one, among the"
16765,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Hebrides. Of the soil, I have already given some account: it is"
16766,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"generally barren, but some spots are not wholly unfruitful. The gardens"
16767,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"have apples and pears, cherries, strawberries, raspberries, currants,"
16768,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and gooseberries, but all the fruit, that I have seen, is small. They"
16769,VII.--TO THE SAME.,attempt to sow nothing but oats and barley. Oats constitute the bread-corn
16770,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of the place. Their harvest is about the beginning of October; and,"
16771,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"being so late, is very much subject to disappointments from the rains"
16772,VII.--TO THE SAME.,that follow the equinox. This year has been particularly disastrous.
16773,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Their rainy season lasts from autumn to spring. They have seldom very
16774,VII.--TO THE SAME.,hard frosts; nor was it ever known that a lake was covered with ice
16775,VII.--TO THE SAME.,strong enough to bear a skater. The sea round them is always open. The
16776,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"snow falls, but soon melts; only in 1771, they had a cold spring, in"
16777,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which the island was so long covered with it, that many beasts, both"
16778,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"wild and domestick, perished, and the whole country was reduced to"
16779,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"distress, from which I know not if it is even yet recovered."
16780,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16781,VII.--TO THE SAME.,The animals here are not remarkably small; perhaps they recruit their
16782,VII.--TO THE SAME.,breed from the mainland. The cows are sometimes without horns. The
16783,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"horned and unhorned cattle are not accidental variations, but different"
16784,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"species: they will, however, breed together."
16785,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16786,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"October 3rd. The wind is now changed, and if we snatch the moment of"
16787,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"opportunity, an escape from this island is become practicable; I have no"
16788,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"reason to complain of my reception, yet I long to be again at home."
16789,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16790,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"You and my master may, perhaps, expect, after this description of Skie,"
16791,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"some account of myself. My eye is, I am afraid, not fully recovered; my"
16792,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"ears are not mended; my nerves seem to grow weaker, and I have been"
16793,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"otherwise not as well as I sometimes am, but think myself, lately,"
16794,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"better. This climate, perhaps, is not within my degree of healthy"
16795,VII.--TO THE SAME.,latitude.
16796,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16797,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Thus I have given my most honoured mistress the story of me and my
16798,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"little ramble. We are now going to some other isle, to what we know not;"
16799,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the wind will tell us. I am, &c."

16805,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16806,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"DEAR MADAM,--Though I have written to Mr. Thrale, yet having a little"
16807,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"more time than was promised me, I would not suffer the messenger to go"
16808,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"without some token of my duty to my mistress, who, I suppose, expects"
16809,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the usual tribute of intelligence, a tribute which I am not very able to"
16810,VII.--TO THE SAME.,pay.
16811,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16812,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"October 3rd. After having been detained, by storms, many days in Skie,"
16813,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"we left it, as we thought, with a fair wind; but a violent gust, which"
16814,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Bos. had a great mind to call a tempest, forced us into Col, an obscure"
16815,VII.--TO THE SAME.,island; on which
16816,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16817,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"--""nulla campis Arbor aestiva recreatur aura."""
16818,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16819,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"There is literally no tree upon the island, part of it is a sandy waste,"
16820,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"over which it would be really dangerous to travel in dry weather, and"
16821,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with a high wind. It seems to be little more than one continued rock,"
16822,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"covered, from space to space, with a thin layer of earth. It is,"
16823,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"however, according to the highland notion, very populous, and life is"
16824,VII.--TO THE SAME.,improved beyond the manners of Skie; for the huts are collected into
16825,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"little villages, and every one has a small garden of roots and cabbage."
16826,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"The laird has a new house built by his uncle, and an old castle"
16827,VII.--TO THE SAME.,inhabited by his ancestors. The young laird entertained us very
16828,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"liberally; he is heir, perhaps, to three hundred square miles of land,"
16829,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which, at ten shillings an acre, would bring him ninety-six thousand"
16830,VII.--TO THE SAME.,pounds a year. He is desirous of improving the agriculture of his
16831,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"country; and, in imitation of the czar, travelled for improvement, and"
16832,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"worked, with his own hands, upon a farm in Hertfordshire, in the"
16833,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"neighbourhood of your uncle, sir Thomas Salusbury. He talks of doing"
16834,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"useful things, and has introduced turnips for winter fodder. He has made"
16835,VII.--TO THE SAME.,a small essay towards a road.
16836,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16837,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Col is but a barren place. Description has here few opportunities of
16838,VII.--TO THE SAME.,spreading her colours. The difference of day and night is the only
16839,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"vicissitude. The succession of sunshine to rain, or of calms to"
16840,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"tempests, we have not known; wind and rain have been our only weather."
16841,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16842,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"At last, after about nine days, we hired a sloop; and having lain in it"
16843,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"all night, with such accommodations as these miserable vessels can"
16844,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"afford, were landed yesterday on the isle of Mull; from which we expect"
16845,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"an easy passage into Scotland. I am sick in a ship, but recover by lying"
16846,VII.--TO THE SAME.,down.
16847,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16848,VII.--TO THE SAME.,I have not good health; I do not find that travelling much helps me. My
16849,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"nights are flatulent, though not in the utmost degree, and I have a"
16850,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"weakness in my knees, which makes me very unable to walk. Pray, dear"
16851,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"madam, let me have a long letter. I am, &c."

16853,VII.--TO THE SAME.,

16855,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16856,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Inverary, Oct. 24, 1773."
16857,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16858,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"HONOURED MISTRESS,--My last letters to you, and my dear master, were"
16859,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"written from Mull, the third island of the Hebrides in extent. There is"
16860,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"no post, and I took the opportunity of a gentleman's passage to the"
16861,VII.--TO THE SAME.,mainland.
16862,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16863,VII.--TO THE SAME.,In Mull we were confined two days by the weather; on the third we got on
16864,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"horseback, and, after a journey, difficult and tedious, over rocks"
16865,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"naked, and valleys untracked, through a country of barrenness and"
16866,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"solitude, we came, almost in the dark, to the seaside, weary and"
16867,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"dejected, having met with nothing but water falling from the mountains"
16868,VII.--TO THE SAME.,that could raise any image of delight. Our company was the young laird
16869,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of Col, and his servant. Col made every Maclean open his house, where he"
16870,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"came, and supply us with horses, when we departed; but the horses of"
16871,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"this country are small, and I was not mounted to my wish."
16872,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16873,VII.--TO THE SAME.,At the seaside we found the ferryboat departed; if it had been where it
16874,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"was expected, the wind was against us, and the hour was late, nor was it"
16875,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"very desirable to cross the sea, in darkness, with a small boat. The"
16876,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"captain of a sloop, that had been driven thither by the storms, saw our"
16877,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"distress, and, as we were hesitating and deliberating, sent his boat,"
16878,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which, by Col's order, transported us to the isle of Ulva. We were"
16879,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"introduced to Mr. Macquarry, the head of a small clan, whose ancestors"
16880,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"have reigned in Ulva beyond memory, but who has reduced himself, by his"
16881,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"negligence and folly, to the necessity of selling this venerable"
16882,VII.--TO THE SAME.,patrimony.
16883,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16884,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"On the next morning we passed the strait to Inch Kenneth, an island"
16885,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"about a mile in length, and less than half a mile broad; in which"
16886,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Kenneth, a Scottish saint, established a small clerical college, of"
16887,VII.--TO THE SAME.,which the chapel walls are still standing. At this place I beheld a
16888,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"scene, which I wish you, and my master, and Queeney had partaken."
16889,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16890,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"The only family on the island is that of sir Allan, the chief of the"
16891,VII.--TO THE SAME.,ancient and numerous clan of Maclean; the clan which claims the second
16892,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"place, yielding only to Macdonald in the line of battle. Sir Allan, a"
16893,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"chieftain, a baronet, and a soldier, inhabits, in this insulated desert,"
16894,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"a thatched hut, with no chambers. Young Col, who owns him as his chief,"
16895,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and whose cousin was his lady, had, I believe, given him some notice of"
16896,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"our visit; he received us with the soldier's frankness, and the"
16897,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"gentleman's elegance, and introduced us to his daughters, two young"
16898,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"ladies, who have not wanted education suitable to their birth, and who,"
16899,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"in their cottage, neither forgot their dignity, nor affected to remember"
16900,VII.--TO THE SAME.,it. Do not you wish to have been with us?
16901,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16902,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Sir Allan's affairs are in disorder, by the fault of his ancestors: and,"
16903,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"while he forms some scheme for retrieving them, he has retreated hither."
16904,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16905,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"When our salutations were over, he showed us the island. We walked,"
16906,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"uncovered, into the chapel, and saw, in the reverend ruin, the effects"
16907,VII.--TO THE SAME.,of precipitate reformation. The floor is covered with ancient
16908,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"grave-stones, of which the inscriptions are not now legible; and without,"
16909,VII.--TO THE SAME.,some of the chief families still continue the right of sepulture. The
16910,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"altar is not yet quite demolished; beside it, on the right side, is a"
16911,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"bass-relief of the virgin with her child, and an angel hovering over her."
16912,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"On the other side still stands a hand-bell, which, though it has no"
16913,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"clapper, neither presbyterian bigotry, nor barbarian wantonness, has yet"
16914,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"taken away. The chapel is thirty-eight feet long, and eighteen broad."
16915,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Boswell, who is very pious, went into it at night, to perform his"
16916,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"devotions, but came back, in haste, for fear of spectres. Near the"
16917,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"chapel is a fountain, to which the water, remarkably pure, is conveyed"
16918,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"from a distant hill, through pipes laid by the Romish clergy, which"
16919,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"still perform the office of conveyance, though they have never been"
16920,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"repaired, since popery was suppressed."
16921,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16922,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"We soon after went in to dinner, and wanted neither the comforts nor the"
16923,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"elegancies of life. There were several dishes, and variety of liquors."
16924,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"The servants live in another cottage; in which, I suppose, the meat is"
16925,VII.--TO THE SAME.,dressed.
16926,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16927,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Towards evening, sir Allan told us, that Sunday never passed over him,"
16928,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"like another day. One of the ladies read, and read very well, the"
16929,VII.--TO THE SAME.,evening service;--and paradise was opened in the wild.
16930,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16931,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Next day, 18th, we went and wandered among the rocks on the shore, while"
16932,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the boat was busy in catching oysters, of which there is a great bed."
16933,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Oysters lie upon the sand, one, I think, sticking to another, and"
16934,VII.--TO THE SAME.,cockles are found a few inches under the sand.
16935,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16936,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"We then went in the boat to Sondiland, a little island very near. We"
16937,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"found it a wild rock, of about ten acres; part naked, part covered with"
16938,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sand, out of which we picked shells; and part clothed with a thin layer"
16939,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of mould, on the grass of which a few sheep are sometimes fed. We then"
16940,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"came back and dined. I passed part of the afternoon in reading, and in"
16941,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the evening one of the ladies played on her harpsichord, and Boswell and"
16942,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Col danced a reel with the other.
16943,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16944,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"On the 19th, we persuaded sir Allan to lanch his boat again, and go with"
16945,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"us to Icolmkill, where the first great preacher of Christianity to the"
16946,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Scots built a church, and settled a monastery. In our way we stopped to"
16947,VII.--TO THE SAME.,examine a very uncommon cave on the coast of Mull. We had some
16948,VII.--TO THE SAME.,difficulty to make our way over the vast masses of broken rocks that lie
16949,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"before the entrance, and at the mouth were embarrassed with stones,"
16950,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which the sea had accumulated, as at Brighthelmstone; but, as we"
16951,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"advanced, we reached a floor of soft sand, and, as we left the light"
16952,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"behind us, walked along a very spacious cavity, vaulted over head with"
16953,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"an arch almost regular, by which a mountain was sustained, at least a"
16954,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"very lofty rock. From this magnificent cavern, went a narrow passage to"
16955,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the right hand, which we entered with a candle; and though it was"
16956,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"obstructed with great stones, clambered over them to a second expansion"
16957,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of the cave, in which there lies a great square stone, which might serve"
16958,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"as a table. The air here was very warm, but not oppressive, and the"
16959,VII.--TO THE SAME.,flame of the candle continued pyramidal. The cave goes onward to an
16960,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"unknown extent, but we were now one hundred and sixty yards under"
16961,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"ground; we had but one candle, and had never heard of any that went"
16962,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"farther and came back; we, therefore, thought it prudent to return."
16963,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16964,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Going forward in our boat, we came to a cluster of rocks, black and"
16965,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"horrid, which sir Allan chose for the place where he would eat his"
16966,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"dinner. We climbed till we got seats. The stores were opened, and the"
16967,VII.--TO THE SAME.,repast taken.
16968,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16969,VII.--TO THE SAME.,We then entered the boat again; the night came upon us; the wind rose;
16970,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the sea swelled; and Boswell desired to be set on dry ground: we,"
16971,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"however, pursued our navigation, and passed by several little islands in"
16972,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the silent solemnity of faint moonshine, seeing little, and hearing only"
16973,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the wind and the water. At last, we reached the island, the venerable"
16974,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"seat of ancient sanctity; where secret piety reposed, and where falling"
16975,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"greatness was reposited. The island has no house of entertainment, and"
16976,VII.--TO THE SAME.,we manfully made our bed in a farmer's barn. The description I hope to
16977,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"give you another time. I am, &c."

16983,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
16984,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"DEAREST MADAM,--Among the possibilities of evil, which my imagination"
16985,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"suggested at this distance, I missed that which has really happened. I"
16986,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"never had much hope of a will in your favour, but was willing to believe"
16987,VII.--TO THE SAME.,that no will would have been made. The event is now irrevocable; it
16988,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"remains only to bear it. Not to wish it had been different, is"
16989,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"impossible; but as the wish is painful without use, it is not prudent,"
16990,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"perhaps, not lawful, to indulge it. As life, and vigour of mind, and"
16991,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sprightliness of imagination, and flexibility of attention, are given us"
16992,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"for valuable and useful purposes, we must not think ourselves at liberty"
16993,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"to squander life, to enervate intellectual strength, to cloud our"
16994,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"thoughts, or fix our attention, when, by all this expense, we know that"
16995,VII.--TO THE SAME.,no good can be produced. Be alone as little as you can; when you are
16996,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"alone, do not suffer your thoughts to dwell on what you might have done,"
16997,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"to prevent this disappointment. You, perhaps, could not have done what"
16998,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"you imagine, or might have done it without effect. But even to think in"
16999,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the most reasonable manner, is, for the present, not so useful, as not"
17000,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"to think. Remit yourself solemnly into the hands of God, and then turn"
17001,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"your mind upon the business and amusements which lie before you. ""All is"
17002,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"best,"" says Chene, ""as it has been, excepting the errours of our own"
17003,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"free will."" Burton concludes his long book upon Melancholy, with this"
17004,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"important precept: ""Be not solitary; be not idle."" Remember Chene's"
17005,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"position, and observe Burton's precept."

17007,VII.--TO THE SAME.,We came hither on the ninth of this month. I long to come under your

17073,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"part of life. You have every right to distinction, and should,"
17074,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"therefore, be distinguished. You will see a show with philosophick"
17075,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"superiority, and, therefore, may see it safely. It is easy to talk of"
17076,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sitting at home, contented, when others are seeing, or making shows."
17077,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"But, not to have been where it is supposed, and seldom supposed falsely,"
17078,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"that all would go if they could; to be able to say nothing, when every"

17080,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"exclamations of rapture, without power to depress; to listen to"

17086,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with something better. Company is, in itself, better than solitude, and"
17087,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"pleasure better than indolence: ""Ex nihilo nihil fit,"" says the moral,"

17089,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"nothing, no power of doing good can be obtained. He must mingle with the"
17090,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"world, that desires to be useful. Every new scene impresses new ideas,"
17091,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"enriches the imagination, and enlarges the power of reason, by new"

17124,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"part of it has paid debts, and no small part bought land. As for"
17125,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"gravelling, and walling, and digging, though I am not much delighted"
17126,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with them, yet something, indeed much, must be allowed to every man's"
17127,VII.--TO THE SAME.,taste. He that is growing rich has a right to enjoy part of the growth
17128,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"his own way. I hope to range in the walk, and row upon the water, and"
17129,VII.--TO THE SAME.,devour fruit from the wall.
17130,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17131,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Dr. Taylor wants to be gardening. He means to buy a piece of ground in
17132,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the neighbourhood, and surround it with a wall, and build a gardener's"
17133,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"house upon it, and have fruit, and be happy. Much happiness it will not"
17134,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"bring him; but what can he do better? If I had money enough, what would"
17135,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I do? Perhaps, if you and master did not hold me, I might go to Cairo,"
17136,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and down the Red sea to Bengal, and take a ramble in India. Would this"
17137,VII.--TO THE SAME.,be better than building and planting? It would surely give more variety
17138,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"to the eye, and more amplitude to the mind. Half fourteen thousand would"
17139,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"send me out to see other forms of existence, and bring me back to"
17140,VII.--TO THE SAME.,describe them.

17150,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"MADAM,--I dined to-day at Stowhill, and am come away to write my letter."
17151,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Never, surely, was I such a writer before. Do you keep my letters? I am"
17152,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"not of your opinion, that I shall not like to read them hereafter; for"
17153,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"though there is in them not much history of mind, or anything else, they"
17154,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"will, I hope, always be, in some degree, the records of a pure and"
17155,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"blameless friendship, and, in some hours of languor and sadness, may"
17156,VII.--TO THE SAME.,revive the memory of more cheerful times.
17157,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17158,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Why you should suppose yourself not desirous hereafter to read the
17159,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"history of your own mind, I do not see. Twelve years, on which you now"
17160,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"look, as on a vast expanse of life, will, probably, be passed over"
17161,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"uniformly and smoothly, with very little perception of your progress,"
17162,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and with very few remarks upon the way. The accumulation of knowledge,"
17163,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which you promise to yourself, by which the future is to look back upon"
17164,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the present, with the superiority of manhood to infancy, will, perhaps,"
17165,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"never be attempted, or never will be made; and you will find, as"
17166,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"millions have found before you, that forty-five has made little sensible"
17167,VII.--TO THE SAME.,addition to thirty-three.
17168,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17169,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"As the body, after a certain time, gains no increase of height, and"
17170,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"little of strength, there is, likewise, a period, though more variable"
17171,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"by external causes, when the mind commonly attains its stationary point,"
17172,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and very little advances its powers of reflection, judgment, and"
17173,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"ratiocination. The body may acquire new modes of motion, or new"
17174,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"dexterities of mechanick operations, but its original strength receives"
17175,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"not improvement: the mind may be stored with new languages, or new"
17176,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sciences, but its power of thinking remains nearly the same, and, unless"
17177,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"it attains new subjects of meditation, it commonly produces thoughts of"
17178,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the same force and the same extent, at very distant intervals of life;"
17179,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"as the tree, unless a foreign fruit be ingrafted, gives, year after"
17180,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"year, productions of the same form, and the same flavour."
17181,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17182,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"By intellectual force, or strength of thought, is meant the degree of"
17183,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"power which the mind possesses of surveying the subject of meditation,"
17184,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with its circuit of concomitants, and its train of dependence."
17185,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17186,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Of this power, which all observe to be very different in different"
17187,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"minds, part seems the gift of nature, and part the acquisition of"
17188,VII.--TO THE SAME.,experience. When the powers of nature have attained their intended
17189,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"energy, they can be no more advanced. The shrub can never become a tree."
17190,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"And it is not unreasonable to suppose, that they are, before the middle"

17203,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17204,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"DEAR MADAM,--Instead of forty reasons for my return, one is sufficient,"
17205,VII.--TO THE SAME.,--that you wish for my company. I purpose to write no more till you see
17206,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"me. The ladies at Stowhill and Greenhill are unanimously of opinion,"
17207,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"that it will be best to take a post chaise, and not to be troubled with"
17208,VII.--TO THE SAME.,the vexations of a common carriage. I will venture to suppose the ladies
17209,VII.--TO THE SAME.,at Streatham to be of the same mind.
17210,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17211,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"You will now expect to be told, why you will not be so much wiser, as"
17212,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"you expect, when you have lived twelve years longer."
17213,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17214,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"It is said, and said truly, that experience is the best teacher; and it"
17215,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"is supposed, that, as life is lengthened, experience is increased. But a"
17216,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"closer inspection of human life will discover, that time often passes"
17217,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"without any incident which can much enlarge knowledge, or ratify"
17218,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"judgment. When we are young we learn much, because we are universally"
17219,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"ignorant; we observe every thing, because every thing is new. But, after"
17220,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"some years, the occurrences of daily life are exhausted; one day passes"
17221,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"like another, in the same scene of appearances, in the same course of"
17222,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"transactions: we have to do what we have often done, and what we do not"
17223,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"try, because we do not wish to do much better; we are told what we"
17224,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"already know, and, therefore, what repetition cannot make us know with"
17225,VII.--TO THE SAME.,greater certainty.
17226,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17227,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"He that has early learned much, perhaps, seldom makes, with regard to"
17228,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"life and manners, much addition to his knowledge; not only, because, as"
17229,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"more is known, there is less to learn, but because a mind, stored with"
17230,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"images and principles, turns inwards for its own entertainment, and is"
17231,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"employed in settling those ideas, which run into confusion, and in"
17232,VII.--TO THE SAME.,recollecting those which are stealing away; practices by which wisdom
17233,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"may be kept, but not gained. The merchant, who was at first busy in"
17234,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"acquiring money, ceases to grow richer, from the time when he makes it"
17235,VII.--TO THE SAME.,his business only to count it.
17236,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17237,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Those who have families, or employments, are engaged in business of"
17238,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"little difficulty, but of great importance, requiring rather assiduity"
17239,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of practice than subtilty of speculation, occupying the attention with"
17240,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"images too bulky for refinement, and too obvious for research. The right"
17241,VII.--TO THE SAME.,is already known: what remains is only to follow it. Daily business adds
17242,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"no more to wisdom, than daily lesson to the learning of the teacher. But"
17243,VII.--TO THE SAME.,of how few lives does not stated duty claim the greater part!
17244,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17245,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Far the greater part of human minds never endeavour their own
17246,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"improvement. Opinions, once received from instruction, or settled by"
17247,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"whatever accident, are seldom recalled to examination; having been once"
17248,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"supposed to be right, they are never discovered to be erroneous, for no"
17249,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"application is made of any thing that time may present, either to shake"
17250,VII.--TO THE SAME.,or to confirm them. From this acquiescence in preconceptions none are
17251,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"wholly free; between fear of uncertainty, and dislike of labour, every"
17252,VII.--TO THE SAME.,one rests while he might yet go forward; and they that were wise at
17253,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"thirty-three, are very little wiser at forty-five."
17254,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17255,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Of this speculation you are, perhaps, tired, and would rather hear of"
17256,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Sophy. I hope, before this comes, that her head will be easier, and your"
17257,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"head less filled with fears and troubles, which you know are to be"

17259,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17260,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Your uneasiness about Sophy is, probably, unnecessary, and, at worst,"

17277,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Poor, dear, sweet little boy! When I read the letter this day to Mrs."

17279,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I may convince myself of this, the tears are in my eyes, and yet I could"
17280,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"not love him as you loved him, nor reckon upon him for a future comfort,"

17286,VII.--TO THE SAME.,

17291,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17292,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I have known you, madam, too long to think that you want any arguments"

17294,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"effect, but that of showing that I wish to comfort you. What can be"
17295,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"done, you must do for yourself. Remember first, that your child is"
17296,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"happy; and then, that he is safe, not only from the ills of this world,"
17297,VII.--TO THE SAME.,but from those more formidable dangers which extend their mischief to
17298,VII.--TO THE SAME.,eternity. You have brought into the world a rational being; have seen
17299,VII.--TO THE SAME.,him happy during the little life that has been granted him; and can have
17300,VII.--TO THE SAME.,no doubt but that his happiness is now permanent and immutable.
17301,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17302,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"When you have obtained, by prayer, such tranquillity as nature will"

17330,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"remit the practice of writing down occurrences as they arise, of"
17331,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"whatever kind, and be very punctual in annexing the dates. Chronology,"
17332,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"you know, is the eye of history; and every man's life is of importance"

17335,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which I will not promise, with Aeneas, ""et haec olim meminisse juvabit;"""
17336,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"yet that remembrance which is not pleasant, may be useful. There is,"
17337,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"however, an intemperate attention to slight circumstances, which is to"
17338,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"be avoided, lest a great part of life be spent in writing the history of"

17583,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"for what? and said there was nothing to be done, which nature would not"
17584,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"do for herself. On Sunday evening, I was at Mrs. Vesy's, and there was"
17585,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"inquiry about my master, but I told them all good. There was Dr. Bernard"
17586,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of Eton, and we made a noise all the evening; and there was Pepys, and"
17587,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Wraxal, till I drove him away. And I have no loss of my mistress, who"
17588,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"laughs, and frisks, and frolicks it all the long day, and never thinks"

17590,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17591,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"If Mr. Thrale will but continue to mend, we shall, I hope, come together"

17594,VII.--TO THE SAME.,not be easy for you to find such another.
17595,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17596,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Queeney has been a good girl, and wrote me a letter; if Burney said she"
17597,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"would write, she told you a fib. She writes nothing to me. She can write"

17601,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Lawrence three times over. And yet what a gipsy it is. She no more minds

17617,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and, sometimes, very little of them. Now I have begun, however, I do not"

17621,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17622,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Now you think yourself the first writer in the world for a letter about

17625,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"graceful negligence of transition, like the ancient enthusiasts? The"
17626,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"pure voice of nature and of friendship. Now, of whom shall I proceed to"
17627,VII.--TO THE SAME.,speak? Of whom but Mrs. Montague? Having mentioned Shakespeare and
17628,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"nature, does not the name of Montague force itself upon me? Such were"
17629,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the transitions of the ancients, which now seem abrupt, because the"

17714,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"some papists, I think, and burnt a mass-house in Moorfields the same"
17715,VII.--TO THE SAME.,night.
17716,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17717,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"On Wednesday, I walked with Dr. Scott, to look at Newgate, and found it"
17718,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"in ruins, with the fire yet glowing As I went by, the protestants were"
17719,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"plundering the Sessions house at the Old Bailey. There were not, I"
17720,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"believe, a hundred; but they did their work at leisure, in full"
17721,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"security, without sentinels, without trepidation, as men lawfully"
17722,VII.--TO THE SAME.,employed in full day. Such is the cowardice of a commercial place. On
17723,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Wednesday they broke open the Fleet, and the King's Bench, and the"
17724,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Marshalsea, and Wood street Counter, and Clerkenwell Bridewell, and"
17725,VII.--TO THE SAME.,released all the prisoners.
17726,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17727,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"At night, they set fire to the Fleet, and to the King's Bench, and I"
17728,VII.--TO THE SAME.,know not how many other places; and one might see the glare of
17729,VII.--TO THE SAME.,conflagration fill the sky from many parts. The sight was dreadful. Some
17730,VII.--TO THE SAME.,people were threatened; Mr. Strahan advised me to take care of myself.
17731,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Such a time of terrour you have been happy in not seeing.

17733,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"The king said, in council, that the magistrates had not done their duty,"
17734,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"but that he would do his own; and a proclamation was published,"
17735,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"directing us to keep our servants within doors, as the peace was now to"
17736,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"be preserved by force. The soldiers were sent out to different parts,"
17737,VII.--TO THE SAME.,and the town is now at quiet.
17738,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17739,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"What has happened at your house, you will know; the harm is only a few"

17759,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"that we have had something to suffer, and something to fear, and,"
17760,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"therefore, I think it necessary to quiet the solicitude which you"
17761,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"undoubtedly feel, by telling you that our calamities and terrours are"
17762,VII.--TO THE SAME.,now at an end. The soldiers are stationed so as to be every where within
17763,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"call; there is no longer any body of rioters, and the individuals are"
17764,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"hunted to their holes, and led to prison; the streets are safe and"
17765,VII.--TO THE SAME.,quiet: lord George was last night sent to the Tower. Mr. John Wilkes
17766,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"was, this day, with a party of soldiers, in my neighbourhood, to seize"
17767,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the publisher of a seditious paper. Every body walks, and eats, and"
17768,VII.--TO THE SAME.,sleeps in security. But the history of the last week would fill you with
17769,VII.--TO THE SAME.,amazement: it is without any modern example.
17770,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17771,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Several chapels have been destroyed, and several inoffensive papists"

17774,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"liberty; but, of the criminals, as has always happened, many are already"

17792,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"mind. I am not without my part of the calamity. No death, since that of"
17793,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"my wife, has ever oppressed me like this. But let us remember, that we"

17795,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"who will look upon us, with mercy, through all our variations of"

17797,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"upon him in this great revolution of life, and call with confidence. You"
17798,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"will then find comfort for the past, and support for the future. He that"
17799,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"has given you happiness in marriage, to a degree of which, without"
17800,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"personal knowledge, I should have thought the description fabulous, can"
17801,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"give you another mode of happiness as a mother, and, at last, the"

17803,VII.--TO THE SAME.,in heaven.
17804,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17805,VII.--TO THE SAME.,I do not exhort you to reason yourself into tranquillity. We must first
17806,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"pray, and then labour; first implore the blessing of God, and use those"
17807,VII.--TO THE SAME.,means which he puts into our hands. Cultivated ground has few weeds; a

17812,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"satisfied; and, that the other executors, more used to consider property"
17813,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"than I, commended it for wisdom and equity. Yet, why should I not tell"

17854,VII.--TO THE SAME.,effect to be humbly expected from trust in God. Do not represent life as
17855,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"darker than it is. Your loss has been very great, but you retain more"
17856,VII.--TO THE SAME.,than almost any other can hope to possess. You are high in the opinion
17857,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"of mankind; you have children, from whom much pleasure may be expected;"
17858,VII.--TO THE SAME.,and that you will find many friends you have no reason to doubt. Of my

17867,VII.--TO THE SAME.,The prudence and resolution of your design to return so soon to your

17877,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17878,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"DEAR MADAM,--I am sitting down, in no cheerful solitude, to write a"
17879,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"narrative, which would once have affected you with tenderness and"
17880,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sorrow, but which you will, perhaps, pass over now with a careless"
17881,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"glance of frigid indifference. For this diminution of regard, however, I"
17882,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"know not whether I ought to blame you, who may have reasons which I"
17883,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"cannot know; and I do not blame myself, who have, for a great part of"
17884,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"human life, done you what good I could, and have never done you evil."
17885,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17886,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I have been disordered in the usual way, and had been relieved, by the"
17887,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"usual methods, by opium and catharticks, but had rather lessened my dose"
17888,VII.--TO THE SAME.,of opium.
17889,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17890,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"On Monday, the 16th, I sat for my picture, and walked a considerable"
17891,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"way, with little inconvenience. In the afternoon and evening, I felt"
17892,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"myself light and easy, and began to plan schemes of life. Thus I went to"
17893,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"bed, and, in a short time, waked and sat up, as has been long my custom,"
17894,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"when I felt a confusion and indistinctness in my head, which lasted, I"
17895,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"suppose, about half a minute; I was alarmed, and prayed God, that,"
17896,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"however he might afflict my body, he would spare my understanding. This"
17897,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"prayer, that I might try the integrity of my faculties, I made in Latin"
17898,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"verse. The lines were not very good, but I knew them not to be very"
17899,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"good: I made them easily, and concluded myself to be unimpaired in my"
17900,VII.--TO THE SAME.,faculties.
17901,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17902,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Soon after, I perceived that I had suffered a paralytick stroke, and"
17903,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"that my speech was taken from me. I had no pain, and so little"
17904,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"dejection, in this dreadful state, that I wondered at my own apathy, and"
17905,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"considered that, perhaps, death itself, when it should come, would"
17906,VII.--TO THE SAME.,excite less horrour than seems now to attend it.
17907,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17908,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"In order to rouse the vocal organs, I took two drams. Wine has been"
17909,VII.--TO THE SAME.,celebrated for the production of eloquence. I put myself into violent
17910,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"motion, and, I think, repeated it; but all was vain. I then went to bed,"
17911,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and, strange as it may seem, I think, slept. When I saw light, it was"
17912,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"time to contrive what I should do. Though God stopped my speech, he left"
17913,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"me my hand: I enjoyed a mercy, which was not granted to my dear friend"
17914,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Lawrence, who now, perhaps, overlooks me, as I am writing, and rejoices"
17915,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"that I have what he wanted. My first note was, necessarily, to my"
17916,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"servant, who came in talking, and could not immediately comprehend, why"
17917,VII.--TO THE SAME.,he should read what I put into his hands.
17918,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17919,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I then wrote a card to Mr. Allen, that I might have a discreet friend at"
17920,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"hand, to act as occasion should require. In penning this note, I had"
17921,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"some difficulty; my hand, I knew not how nor why, made wrong letters. I"
17922,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"then wrote to Dr. Taylor, to come to me, and bring Dr. Heberden, and I"
17923,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"sent to Dr. Brocklesby, who is my neighbour. My physicians are very"
17924,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"friendly and very disinterested, and give me great hopes, but you may"
17925,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"imagine my situation. I have so far recovered my vocal powers, as to"
17926,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"repeat the Lord's prayer, with no very imperfect articulation. My"
17927,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"memory, I hope, yet remains as it was; but such an attack produces"
17928,VII.--TO THE SAME.,solicitude for the safety of every faculty.
17929,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
17930,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"How this will be received by you, I know not. I hope you will sympathize"

17938,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"hour, remembered by you; and, surely, it cannot be remembered but with"
17939,VII.--TO THE SAME.,some degree of kindness. I have loved you with virtuous affection; I
17940,VII.--TO THE SAME.,have honoured you with sincere esteem. Let not all our endearments be
17941,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"forgotten, but let me have, in this great distress, your pity and your"
17942,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"prayers. You see, I yet turn to you with my complaints, as a settled and"
17943,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"unalienable friend; do not, do not drive me from you, for I have not"

17951,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I suppose, you may wish to know, how my disease is treated by the"

17954,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"those on the throat have not risen. I bullied and bounced, (it sticks to"
17955,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"our last sand,) and compelled the apothecary to make his salve according"
17956,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"to the Edinburgh dispensatory, that it might adhere better. I have two"
17957,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"on now of my own prescription. They, likewise, give me salt of"

17979,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"reflect them. It wastes a diamond placed in the focus, but causes no"
17980,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"diminution of pure gold. Of the rubies, exposed to its action, one was"
17981,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"made more vivid, the other paler. To see the glass, I climbed up stairs"
17982,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"to the garret, and then up a ladder to the leads, and talked to the"
17983,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"artist rather too long; for my voice, though clear and distinct for a"

18011,VII.--TO THE SAME.,air of Beckenham; and pleased me very much by his affectionate attention
18012,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"to Miss Vesy. There is much good in his character, and much usefulness"
18013,VII.--TO THE SAME.,in his knowledge.
18014,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
18015,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Queeney seems now to have forgotten me. Of the different appearance of
18016,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the hills and valleys an account may, perhaps, be given, without the"
18017,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"supposition of any prodigy! If she had been out, and the evening was"
18018,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"breezy, the exhalations would rise from the low grounds very copiously;"
18019,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"and the wind that swept and cleared the hills, would only, by its cold,"
18020,VII.--TO THE SAME.,condense the vapours of the sheltered valleys.
18021,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
18022,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Murphy is just gone from me; he visits me very kindly, and I have no"
18023,VII.--TO THE SAME.,unkindness to complain of.

18025,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"I am sorry that sir Philip's request was not treated with more respect,"

18038,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Two nights ago, Mr. Burke sat with me a long time; he seems much pleased"
18039,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"with his journey. We had both seen Stonehenge this summer, for the first"
18040,VII.--TO THE SAME.,time. I told him that the view had enabled me to confute two opinions
18041,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"which have been advanced about it. One, that the materials are not"
18042,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"natural stones, but an artificial composition, hardened by time. This"
18043,VII.--TO THE SAME.,notion is as old as Camden's time; and has this strong argument to
18044,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"support it, that stone of that species is nowhere to be found. The other"
18045,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"opinion, advanced by Dr. Charlton, is, that it was erected by the Danes."
18046,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
18047,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"Mr. Bowles made me observe, that the transverse stones were fixed on the"
18048,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"perpendicular supporters by a knob, formed on the top of the upright"
18049,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"stone, which entered into a hollow, cut in the crossing stone. This is a"
18050,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"proof, that the enormous edifice was raised by a people who had not yet"
18051,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"the knowledge of mortar; which cannot be supposed of the Danes, who came"
18052,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"hither in ships, and were not ignorant, certainly, of the arts of life."
18053,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"This proves, likewise, the stones not to be factitious; for they that"
18054,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"could mould such durable masses, could do much more than make mortar,"
18055,VII.--TO THE SAME.,and could have continued the transverse from the upright part with the
18056,VII.--TO THE SAME.,same paste.
18057,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
18058,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"You have, doubtless, seen Stonehenge; and if you have not, I should"
18059,VII.--TO THE SAME.,think it a hard task to make an adequate description.
18060,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
18061,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"It is, in my opinion, to be referred to the earliest habitation of the"
18062,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"island, as a druidical monument of, at least, two thousand years;"
18063,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"probably the most ancient work of man, upon the island. Salisbury"
18064,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"cathedral, and its neighbour Stonehenge, are two eminent monuments of"
18065,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"art and rudeness, and may show the first essay, and the last perfection"

18078,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"DEAR MADAM,--The wearisome solitude of the long evenings did, indeed,"
18079,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"suggest to me the convenience of a club in my neighbourhood, but I have"
18080,VII.--TO THE SAME.,been hindered from attending it by want of breath. If I can complete the
18081,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"scheme, you shall have the names and the regulations."
18082,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
18083,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"The time of the year, for I hope the fault is rather in the weather than"
18084,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"in me, has been very hard upon me. The muscles of my breast are much"
18085,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"convulsed. Dr. Heberden recommends opiates, of which I have such"
18086,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"horrour, that I do not think of them but _in extremis_. I was, however,"
18087,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"driven to them, last night, for refuge, and, having taken the usual"
18088,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"quantity, durst not go to bed, for fear of that uneasiness to which a"
18089,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"supine posture exposes me, but rested all night in a chair, with much"
18090,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"relief, and have been, to-day, more warm, active, and cheerful."
18091,VII.--TO THE SAME.,
18092,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"You have more than once wondered at my complaint of solitude, when you"
18093,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"hear that I am crowded with visits. ""Inopem me copia fecit."" Visitors"
18094,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"are no proper companions in the chamber of sickness. They come, when I"
18095,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"could sleep or read, they stay till I am weary, they force me to attend,"
18096,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"when my mind calls for relaxation, and to speak, when my powers will"
18097,VII.--TO THE SAME.,hardly actuate my tongue. The amusements and consolations of languor and
18098,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"depression are conferred by familiar and domestick companions, which can"
18099,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"be visited or called at will, and can, occasionally, be quitted or"
18100,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"dismissed, who do not obstruct accommodation by ceremony, or destroy"

18118,VII.--TO THE SAME.,

18125,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Do not think slightly of the advice which I now presume to offer.
18126,VII.--TO THE SAME.,Prevail upon Mr. Piozzi to settle in England; you may live here with
18127,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"more dignity than in Italy, and with more security; your rank will be"
18128,VII.--TO THE SAME.,"higher, and your fortune more under your own eye. I desire not to detail"
18129,VII.--TO THE SAME.,all my reasons; but every argument of prudence and interest is for
