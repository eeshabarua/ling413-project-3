55,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
56,PREFACE.,
57,PREFACE.,
58,PREFACE.,Nearly the whole of this volume is a reprint of the serious portion of
59,PREFACE.,"_Phantasmagoria and other Poems_, which was first published in 1869 and"
60,PREFACE.,"has long been out of print. ""The Path of Roses"" was written soon after the"
61,PREFACE.,"Crimean War, when the name of Florence Nightingale had already become a"
62,PREFACE.,"household-word. ""Only a Woman's Hair"" was suggested by a circumstance"
63,PREFACE.,"mentioned in _The Life of Dean Swift_, viz., that, after his death, a"
64,PREFACE.,"small packet was found among his papers, containing a single lock of hair"
65,PREFACE.,"and inscribed with those words. ""After Three Days"" was written after"
66,PREFACE.,"seeing Holman Hunt's picture, _The Finding of Christ in the Temple_."
67,PREFACE.,
68,PREFACE.,"The two poems, ""Far Away"" and ""A Song of Love"", are reprinted from _Sylvie"
69,PREFACE.,"and Bruno_ and _Sylvie and Bruno Concluded_, books whose high price (made"
70,PREFACE.,"necessary by the great cost of production) has, I fear, put them out of"
71,PREFACE.,"the reach of most of my readers. ""A Lesson in Latin"" is reprinted from"
72,PREFACE.,"_The Jabberwock_, a Magazine got up among the Members of ""The Girls' Latin"
73,PREFACE.,"School, Boston, U.S.A."" The only poems, here printed for the first time,"
74,PREFACE.,"are put together under the title of ""Puck Lost and Found,"" having been"
75,PREFACE.,"inscribed in two books--_Fairies_, a poem by Allingham, illustrated by"
76,PREFACE.,"Miss E. Gertrude Thomson, and _Merry Elves_, a story-book, by whom written"
77,PREFACE.,"I do not know, illustrated by C. O. Murray--which were presented to a"
78,PREFACE.,"little girl and boy, as a sort of memento of a visit paid by them to the"
79,PREFACE.,"author one day, on which occasion he taught them the pastime--dear to the"
80,PREFACE.,"hearts of children--of folding paper-""pistols,"" which can be made to"
81,PREFACE.,"imitate, fairly well, the noise of a real one."

156,THREE SUNSETS.,THREE SUNSETS.
157,THREE SUNSETS.,
158,THREE SUNSETS.,
159,THREE SUNSETS.,"He saw her once, and in the glance,"
160,THREE SUNSETS.,"A moment's glance of meeting eyes,"
161,THREE SUNSETS.,His heart stood still in sudden trance:
162,THREE SUNSETS.,He trembled with a sweet surprise--
163,THREE SUNSETS.,"All in the waning light she stood,"
164,THREE SUNSETS.,The star of perfect womanhood.
165,THREE SUNSETS.,
166,THREE SUNSETS.,That summer-eve his heart was light:
167,THREE SUNSETS.,With lighter step he trod the ground:
168,THREE SUNSETS.,"And life was fairer in his sight,"
169,THREE SUNSETS.,And music was in every sound:
170,THREE SUNSETS.,He blessed the world where there could be
171,THREE SUNSETS.,So beautiful a thing as she.
172,THREE SUNSETS.,
173,THREE SUNSETS.,"There once again, as evening fell"
174,THREE SUNSETS.,"And stars were peering overhead,"
175,THREE SUNSETS.,Two lovers met to bid farewell:
176,THREE SUNSETS.,"The western sun gleamed faint and red,"
177,THREE SUNSETS.,Lost in a drift of purple cloud
178,THREE SUNSETS.,That wrapped him like a funeral-shroud.
179,THREE SUNSETS.,
180,THREE SUNSETS.,Long time the memory of that night--
181,THREE SUNSETS.,"The hand that clasped, the lips that kissed,"
182,THREE SUNSETS.,The form that faded from his sight
183,THREE SUNSETS.,Slow sinking through the tearful mist--
184,THREE SUNSETS.,In dreamy music seemed to roll
185,THREE SUNSETS.,Through the dark chambers of his soul.
186,THREE SUNSETS.,
187,THREE SUNSETS.,So after many years he came
188,THREE SUNSETS.,A wanderer from a distant shore:
189,THREE SUNSETS.,"The street, the house, were still the same,"
190,THREE SUNSETS.,But those he sought were there no more:
191,THREE SUNSETS.,"His burning words, his hopes and fears,"
192,THREE SUNSETS.,Unheeded fell on alien ears.
193,THREE SUNSETS.,
194,THREE SUNSETS.,Only the children from their play
195,THREE SUNSETS.,"Would pause the mournful tale to hear,"
196,THREE SUNSETS.,"Shrinking in half-alarm away,"
197,THREE SUNSETS.,"Or, step by step, would venture near"
198,THREE SUNSETS.,To touch with timid curious hands
199,THREE SUNSETS.,That strange wild man from other lands.
200,THREE SUNSETS.,
201,THREE SUNSETS.,"He sat beside the busy street,"
202,THREE SUNSETS.,"There, where he last had seen her face:"
203,THREE SUNSETS.,"And thronging memories, bitter-sweet,"
204,THREE SUNSETS.,Seemed yet to haunt the ancient place:
205,THREE SUNSETS.,Her footfall ever floated near:
206,THREE SUNSETS.,Her voice was ever in his ear.
207,THREE SUNSETS.,
208,THREE SUNSETS.,"He sometimes, as the daylight waned"
209,THREE SUNSETS.,"And evening mists began to roll,"
210,THREE SUNSETS.,In half-soliloquy complained
211,THREE SUNSETS.,"Of that black shadow on his soul,"
212,THREE SUNSETS.,"And blindly fanned, with cruel care,"
213,THREE SUNSETS.,The ashes of a vain despair.
214,THREE SUNSETS.,
215,THREE SUNSETS.,The summer fled: the lonely man
216,THREE SUNSETS.,Still lingered out the lessening days;
217,THREE SUNSETS.,"Still, as the night drew on, would scan"
218,THREE SUNSETS.,Each passing face with closer gaze--
219,THREE SUNSETS.,"Till, sick at heart, he turned away,"
220,THREE SUNSETS.,"And sighed ""she will not come to-day."""
221,THREE SUNSETS.,
222,THREE SUNSETS.,So by degrees his spirit bent
223,THREE SUNSETS.,"To mock its own despairing cry,"
224,THREE SUNSETS.,In stern self-torture to invent
225,THREE SUNSETS.,"New luxuries of agony,"
226,THREE SUNSETS.,And people all the vacant space
227,THREE SUNSETS.,With visions of her perfect face.
228,THREE SUNSETS.,
229,THREE SUNSETS.,"Then for a moment she was nigh,"
230,THREE SUNSETS.,"He heard no step, but she was there;"
231,THREE SUNSETS.,As if an angel suddenly
232,THREE SUNSETS.,"Were bodied from the viewless air,"
233,THREE SUNSETS.,And all her fine ethereal frame
234,THREE SUNSETS.,Should fade as swiftly as it came.
235,THREE SUNSETS.,
236,THREE SUNSETS.,"So, half in fancy's sunny trance,"
237,THREE SUNSETS.,And half in misery's aching void
238,THREE SUNSETS.,With set and stony countenance
239,THREE SUNSETS.,"His bitter being he enjoyed,"
240,THREE SUNSETS.,And thrust for ever from his mind
241,THREE SUNSETS.,The happiness he could not find.
242,THREE SUNSETS.,
243,THREE SUNSETS.,"As when the wretch, in lonely room,"
244,THREE SUNSETS.,"To selfish death is madly hurled,"
245,THREE SUNSETS.,The glamour of that fatal fume
246,THREE SUNSETS.,Shuts out the wholesome living world--
247,THREE SUNSETS.,So all his manhood's strength and pride
248,THREE SUNSETS.,One sickly dream had swept aside.
249,THREE SUNSETS.,
250,THREE SUNSETS.,"Yea, brother, and we passed him there,"
251,THREE SUNSETS.,"But yesterday, in merry mood,"
252,THREE SUNSETS.,And marveled at the lordly air
253,THREE SUNSETS.,"That shamed his beggar's attitude,"
254,THREE SUNSETS.,Nor heeded that ourselves might be
255,THREE SUNSETS.,Wretches as desperate as he;
256,THREE SUNSETS.,
257,THREE SUNSETS.,Who let the thought of bliss denied
258,THREE SUNSETS.,"Make havoc of our life and powers,"
259,THREE SUNSETS.,"And pine, in solitary pride,"
260,THREE SUNSETS.,"For peace that never shall be ours,"
261,THREE SUNSETS.,Because we will not work and wait
262,THREE SUNSETS.,In trustful patience for our fate.
263,THREE SUNSETS.,
264,THREE SUNSETS.,And so it chanced once more that she
265,THREE SUNSETS.,Came by the old familiar spot:
266,THREE SUNSETS.,The face he would have died to see
267,THREE SUNSETS.,"Bent o'er him, and he knew it not;"
268,THREE SUNSETS.,"Too rapt in selfish grief to hear,"
269,THREE SUNSETS.,Even when happiness was near.
270,THREE SUNSETS.,
271,THREE SUNSETS.,And pity filled her gentle breast
272,THREE SUNSETS.,For him that would not stir nor speak
273,THREE SUNSETS.,"The dying crimson of the west,"
274,THREE SUNSETS.,"That faintly tinged his haggard cheek,"
275,THREE SUNSETS.,"Fell on her as she stood, and shed"
276,THREE SUNSETS.,A glory round the patient head.
277,THREE SUNSETS.,
278,THREE SUNSETS.,"Ah, let him wake! The moments fly:"
279,THREE SUNSETS.,This awful tryst may be the last.
280,THREE SUNSETS.,"And see, the tear, that dimmed her eye,"
281,THREE SUNSETS.,Had fallen on him ere she passed--
282,THREE SUNSETS.,She passed: the crimson paled to gray:
283,THREE SUNSETS.,And hope departed with the day.
284,THREE SUNSETS.,
285,THREE SUNSETS.,"The heavy hours of night went by,"
286,THREE SUNSETS.,"And silence quickened into sound,"
287,THREE SUNSETS.,"And light slid up the eastern sky,"
288,THREE SUNSETS.,And life began its daily round--
289,THREE SUNSETS.,But light and life for him were fled:
290,THREE SUNSETS.,His name was numbered with the dead.

301,THE PATH OF ROSES.,
302,THE PATH OF ROSES.,
303,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"In the dark silence of an ancient room,"
304,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"Whose one tall window fronted to the West,"
305,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"Where, through laced tendrils of a hanging vine,"
306,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"The sunset-glow was fading into night,"
307,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"Sat a pale Lady, resting weary hands"
308,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"Upon a great clasped volume, and her face"
309,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"Within her hands. Not as in rest she bowed,"
310,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"But large hot tears were coursing down her cheek,"
311,THE PATH OF ROSES.,And her low-panted sobs broke awefully
312,THE PATH OF ROSES.,Upon the sleeping echoes of the night.
313,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"Soon she unclasp'd the volume once again,"
314,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"And read the words in tone of agony,"
315,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"As in self-torture, weeping as she read:--"
316,THE PATH OF ROSES.,
317,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"_""He crowns the glory of his race:"
318,THE PATH OF ROSES.,He prayeth but in some fit place
319,THE PATH OF ROSES.,To meet his foeman face to face:
320,THE PATH OF ROSES.,
321,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"""And, battling for the True, the Right,"
322,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"From ruddy dawn to purple night,"
323,THE PATH OF ROSES.,To perish in the midmost fight:
324,THE PATH OF ROSES.,
325,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"""Where hearts are fierce and hands are strong,"
326,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"Where peals the bugle loud and long,"
327,THE PATH OF ROSES.,Where blood is dropping in the throng:
328,THE PATH OF ROSES.,
329,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"""Still, with a dim and glazing eye,"
330,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"To watch the tide of victory,"
331,THE PATH OF ROSES.,To hear in death the battle-cry:
332,THE PATH OF ROSES.,
333,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"""Then, gathered grandly to his grave,"
334,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"To rest among the true and brave,"
335,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"In holy ground, where yew-trees wave:"
336,THE PATH OF ROSES.,
337,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"""Where, from church-windows sculptured fair,"
338,THE PATH OF ROSES.,Float out upon the evening air
339,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"The note of praise, the voice of prayer:"
340,THE PATH OF ROSES.,
341,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"""Where no vain marble mockery"
342,THE PATH OF ROSES.,Insults with loud and boastful lie
343,THE PATH OF ROSES.,The simple soldier's memory:
344,THE PATH OF ROSES.,
345,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"""Where sometimes little children go,"
346,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"And read, in whisper'd accent slow,"
347,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"The name of him who sleeps below.""_"
348,THE PATH OF ROSES.,
349,THE PATH OF ROSES.,Her voice died out: like one in dreams she sat.
350,THE PATH OF ROSES.,"""Alas!"" she sighed. ""For what can Woman do?"

785,STOLEN WATERS.,"The light was faint, and soft the air"
786,STOLEN WATERS.,That breathed around the place;
787,STOLEN WATERS.,"And she was lithe, and tall, and fair,"
788,STOLEN WATERS.,And with a wayward grace
789,STOLEN WATERS.,Her queenly head she bare.
790,STOLEN WATERS.,
791,STOLEN WATERS.,"With glowing cheek, with gleaming eye,"
792,STOLEN WATERS.,She met me on the way:
793,STOLEN WATERS.,My spirit owned the witchery
794,STOLEN WATERS.,Within her smile that lay:
795,STOLEN WATERS.,"I followed her, I knew not why."
796,STOLEN WATERS.,
797,STOLEN WATERS.,"The trees were thick with many a fruit,"
798,STOLEN WATERS.,The grass with many a flower:
799,STOLEN WATERS.,"My soul was dead, my tongue was mute,"
800,STOLEN WATERS.,In that accursëd hour.
801,STOLEN WATERS.,
802,STOLEN WATERS.,"And, in my dream, with silvery voice,"

804,STOLEN WATERS.,"""Youth is the season to rejoice--"""
805,STOLEN WATERS.,I could not choose but stay:
806,STOLEN WATERS.,I could not say her nay.
807,STOLEN WATERS.,
808,STOLEN WATERS.,"She plucked a branch above her head,"
809,STOLEN WATERS.,With rarest fruitage laden:
810,STOLEN WATERS.,"""Drink of the juice, Sir Knight,"" she said:"

817,STOLEN WATERS.,
818,STOLEN WATERS.,I drank the juice; and straightway felt
819,STOLEN WATERS.,A fire within my brain:
820,STOLEN WATERS.,My soul within me seemed to melt
821,STOLEN WATERS.,In sweet delirious pain.
822,STOLEN WATERS.,
823,STOLEN WATERS.,"""Sweet is the stolen draught,"" she said:"

827,STOLEN WATERS.,

829,STOLEN WATERS.,I heard myself replying.

840,STOLEN WATERS.,"""True love gives true love of the best:"

842,STOLEN WATERS.,The very heart from out my breast
843,STOLEN WATERS.,"I plucked, I gave it willingly:"
844,STOLEN WATERS.,Her very heart she gave to me--
845,STOLEN WATERS.,Then died the glory from the west.
846,STOLEN WATERS.,
847,STOLEN WATERS.,"In the gray light I saw her face,"
848,STOLEN WATERS.,"And it was withered, old, and gray;"
849,STOLEN WATERS.,"The flowers were fading in their place,"

851,STOLEN WATERS.,
852,STOLEN WATERS.,"Forth from her, like a hunted deer,"
853,STOLEN WATERS.,"Through all that ghastly night I fled,"
854,STOLEN WATERS.,And still behind me seemed to hear
855,STOLEN WATERS.,Her fierce unflagging tread;
856,STOLEN WATERS.,And scarce drew breath for fear.
857,STOLEN WATERS.,
858,STOLEN WATERS.,Yet marked I well how strangely seemed
859,STOLEN WATERS.,The heart within my breast to sleep:
860,STOLEN WATERS.,"Silent it lay, or so I dreamed,"
861,STOLEN WATERS.,With never a throb or leap.
862,STOLEN WATERS.,
863,STOLEN WATERS.,"For hers was now my heart, she said,"
864,STOLEN WATERS.,The heart that once had been mine own:
865,STOLEN WATERS.,And in my breast I bore instead
866,STOLEN WATERS.,"A cold, cold heart of stone."
867,STOLEN WATERS.,So grew the morning overhead.
868,STOLEN WATERS.,
869,STOLEN WATERS.,The sun shot downward through the trees
870,STOLEN WATERS.,His old familiar flame:
871,STOLEN WATERS.,All ancient sounds upon the breeze
872,STOLEN WATERS.,From copse and meadow came--
873,STOLEN WATERS.,But I was not the same.
874,STOLEN WATERS.,
875,STOLEN WATERS.,"They call me mad: I smile, I weep,"
876,STOLEN WATERS.,Uncaring how or why:
877,STOLEN WATERS.,"Yea, when one's heart is laid asleep,"
878,STOLEN WATERS.,What better than to die?
879,STOLEN WATERS.,So that the grave be dark and deep.
880,STOLEN WATERS.,
881,STOLEN WATERS.,"To die! To die? And yet, methinks,"
882,STOLEN WATERS.,"I drink of life, to-day,"
883,STOLEN WATERS.,Deep as the thirsty traveler drinks
884,STOLEN WATERS.,Of fountain by the way:
885,STOLEN WATERS.,"My voice is sad, my heart is gay."
886,STOLEN WATERS.,
887,STOLEN WATERS.,"When yestereve was on the wane,"
888,STOLEN WATERS.,I heard a clear voice singing
889,STOLEN WATERS.,"So sweetly that, like summer-rain,"

923,STOLEN WATERS.,"If this be madness, better so,"
924,STOLEN WATERS.,"Far better to be mad,"
925,STOLEN WATERS.,Weeping or smiling as I go.
926,STOLEN WATERS.,
927,STOLEN WATERS.,"For if I weep, it is that now"
928,STOLEN WATERS.,"I see how deep a loss is mine,"

933,STOLEN WATERS.,"And if I smile, it is that now"
